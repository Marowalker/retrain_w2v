The reusability of
hybrid core–shell microgels, whose core
surfaces were decorated with gold nanoparticles, was investigated
in terms of catalysis activity. Hybrid core–shell microgels
composed of a rigid core and water-swollen gel shell endowed the immobilized
gold nanoparticles with a high dispersion stability, which resulted
in excellent catalytic activity. In contrast to free Au nanoparticles
and conventional hybrid microgels, where the Au nanoparticles are
randomly distributed over the entire microgel templates, the hydrogel
shell part of the hybrid core–shell microgels suppressed the
aggregation between the microgels and Au nanoparticles in individual
microgels, which improved the reusability for the catalysis reaction.
The results of this study should help to develop advanced catalyst
systems that require high reusability even when the chemical reactions
occur in aqueous solution and external stimuli are applied.

Introduction
Metallic nanoparticles
represent fascinating aspects such as flexible
assembly behavior, which is interesting in the context of materials
science, the behavior of the individual particles, and their electronic,
magnetic, and optical properties, as well as their applications in
catalysis and biology.1−3 To improve the colloidal stability and endow the
metallic nanoparticles with other properties in aqueous solution,
colloidal carriers such as polymeric microspheres are usually applied,4−6 as they exhibit a large specific surface area, fast response, the
potential to be used in mass production, and high diffusibility, as
well as ease of recovery and handling.7−9 Hydrogel microspheres
(microgels) are one of the most extensively studied classes of carriers,
and they exhibit a three-dimensional cross-linked structure that swells
in water.10−17 Hybrid microgels represent attractive prospective components for
functional materials given that they combine the desirable features
of water-swollen microgels (e.g., high colloidal stability and stimuli-responsive
properties) with the attractive properties of metallic nanoparticles.18−27 So far, a variety of metallic nanoparticles immobilized in microgels
have been developed for applications in, for example, sensors,28−31 bioimaging,32,33 and catalysis.34−36

Especially,
the catalytic activity of metallic nanoparticles can
be controlled by using stimuli-responsive microgels as templates.
For example, control over the catalytic activity of metallic nanoparticles
in polystyrene core/thermoresponsive poly(N-isopropyl
acrylamide) (pNIPAm) shell microspheres was achieved via the volume
transition of pNIPAm.23,26,37 Moreover, thermoresponsive Au-pNIPAm yolk shell hybrid microspheres
are effective catalysts for the reduction of p-nitrophenol
and nitrobenzene in water, given that the selectivity of the catalysis
can be enhanced by changing the temperature.38 More recently, hybrid microgel-based catalysts have been developed
for applications in Heck/Suzuki coupling reactions or photocatalysis
in aqueous media, which represent a novel type of green catalysts
that are operative under mild conditions.39−41

However,
to the best of our knowledge, only very few studies have
been reported on the reusability of the hybrid microgels as catalysts
during the reaction.42 In this situation,
aggregation may occur between the metallic nanoparticles in individual
microgels or the hybrid microgels, which leads to a decreased catalytic
activity as a result of the decreasing specific surface area of the
metallic nanoparticles. Such aggregation is likely to occur during
catalysis and/or centrifugation (recovery), as the recovery and reuse
of precious metals is mandatory nowadays, regardless of the type of
carrier. Although various methods for the recovery of metallic nanoparticles
based on filtration,43 dialysis,44 or the application of magnetic fields45 have been reported, centrifugation is the most
common recovery method for colloidal particles, given its speed and
convenience regardless of the presence or absence of metallic nanoparticles.
It is accordingly very important to examine and reveal the aggregation
behavior to develop adequate strategies that allow the suppression
of aggregation during the reactions and centrifugation, which would
be highly attractive for advanced catalytic applications.

To
circumvent this obstacle, we hypothesized that metallic nanoparticles
could be localized on the core surface of microgels composed of a
rigid core and a swollen gel shell to suppress the contact between
the metallic nanoparticles even during reaction and recovery. This
should ensure both high dispersion stability and control over the
diffusivity of the reaction substrates to the metallic nanoparticles
from the bulk solution. In this study, we therefore immobilized metallic
nanoparticles in the core–shell microgels and examined their
catalytic activity and the reusability of these hybrid microgels in
terms of the carrier structures.

Results and Discussion
Synthesis
and Characterization of the Hybrid Microgels
To distribute
the metallic nanoparticles at the center of core–shell
microgels, poly(NIPAm-co-glycidyl methacrylate) (NG) microspheres (rigid core) were prepared by free-radical
polymerization in water (Table 1) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images (Figure 1a) confirmed their
uniformity. Because of the difference in the reactivity ratio between N-isopropylacrylamide (NIPAm) (0.39) and glycidyl methacrylate
(GMA) (2.69), the latter is consumed faster than the former.46 Thus, the exterior of the NG microspheres
is rich in pNIPAm chains,19,20 which are formed by
seeded precipitation polymerization, that can attach easily to pNIPAm
on the surface of the NG core to grow the gel shell.
Furthermore, seeded precipitation polymerizations were conducted in
the presence of core NG microgels to cover the rigid
core with gel layer. Here, the deswollen NG microspheres
served as seeds for further polymerizations, which resulted in the
preferential growth of existing particles relative to nucleation.
It should be noted that the nucleation occurred in solution and that
secondary (or individual) pNIPAm microgels could thus be formed. However,
the monomer concentrations used in this study are relatively low and
the obtained core–shell microgels were purified by centrifugation,
suggesting that the influence of such secondary microgels on the catalytic
reaction should be negligible. The resulting NG core–pNIPAm
shell microgels (denoted as NGN1 and NGN2; NG and N refer to core NG microgels and
the pNIPAm shell, respectively; 1 and 2 indicate shorter and longer
shell thickness, respectively) were also uniform (Figure 1b,c). With increasing NIPAm
monomer concentration during the seeded polymerization, the shell
thickness of pNIPAm and the hydrodynamic diameters (Dh) increased (NG: Dh ≈ 269 nm; NGN1: Dh ≈ 376 nm; NGN2: Dh ≈ 572 nm; all at 25 °C; Table 1). In addition, the NGN1 and NGN2 microgels exhibited thermoresponsive behavior because
of the presence of pNIPAm (Figure 1b,c), although Dh of the
core NG microgels did not significantly change with temperature,
which indicates that the seeded polymerization proceeded successfully.

To introduce positive charges for the NG and NGN microspheres, which lead to a localization of the metallic
nanoparticles on the surface of NG core, the reactive
GMA moieties in the core were modified using 2-aminoethanethiol (2-AET),
that is, the reaction between the thiol and epoxy groups.19,20 The incorporation of the amino groups was confirmed by the slightly
increased Dh of the tested microgels synthesized
in this study relative to those prior to the incorporation of the
amino groups at the individual temperatures (Figure 1). The swelling behavior was attributed predominantly
to the osmotic pressure and to repulsion between the amino groups.
In this case, the increments of size are small because the amino groups
are localized at the surface of core NG microspheres.
It should be noted that the amine groups may potentially react with
epoxides and esters to form secondary amines and amides, respectively,
suggesting that 2-AET could work as a cross-linker. However, the facile
staining of amino-functionalized NG and NGN microgel pastes after centrifugation confirms the successful introduction
of amino groups. After the reaction, the shape of the dried microspheres
on the substrate did not change significantly as evident from the
TEM images (Figure S2).

In this study,
we synthesized Au nanoparticles using these amino-functionalized NG, NGN1, and NGN2 microspheres
as templates. Given that the dispersions of the template microspheres
and the Au precursor anions were mixed for 1 h at 25 °C at low
pH values, that is, with hydrated pNIPAm shells and the gold precursor
ions, [AuCl4]−, should be localized at
the core NG microspheres together with the amino groups.
Subsequently, the microspheres were collected by centrifugation to
remove any excess of anions with the dispersion medium. Immediately
after the addition of NaBH4, the dispersion turned red. Figure 2 shows the TEM images
of the thus obtained hybrid microgels (NG-Au, NGN1-Au, and NGN2-Au), which indicate that the Au nanoparticles
are located at the cores in agreement with our previous studies.19,20,28 The size of these immobilized
Au nanoparticles (∼3 nm) and the narrow size distribution are
shown in the histogram in Figure 2. The weight percentages of the Au nanoparticles in NG-Au (0.69 wt %), NGN1-Au (0.84 wt %), and NGN2-Au (0.77 wt %) were measured by inductively coupled plasma
atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES). It should be noted that to
confirm the effect of the distribution of the Au nanoparticles in
the template microgels on the reusability in the catalysis, another
type of Au nanoparticles was synthesized using the amino-functionalized NGN2 microgels as a template, where the removal of the excess
of gold precursor ions was not carried out19 prior to the reduction. As a result, different from NGN1-Au and NGN2-Au microgels, the Au nanoparticles were localized
randomly in the NGN2 microgels (NGN2-Au(R); Figure 2d) and the
weight percentage of the Au nanoparticles in NGN2-Au(R) (0.98 wt %) was slightly higher than that in the NGN2-Au microgels (0.77 wt %).

nanoparticles within the template microspheres: (a) NG, (b) NGN1, and (c,d) NGN2 microgels. (d)
Au nanoparticles are randomly distributed within the NGN2 microgel templates as the excess of anions was not removed. The
ICP-AES-derived weight percentage of immobilized Au nanoparticles
on each template is also shown.

Reusability Capacity of the Hybrid Microgels in Catalytic Reactions
To characterize the reusability capacity of these hybrid microgels,
we examined the reduction of p-nitrophenol with an
excess of NaBH4 as a model reaction.47,48 In this reaction, the consumption of p-nitrophenol
can be easily monitored via UV–vis spectroscopy via the decrease
of the strong adsorption of the p-nitrophenolate
anion at 400 nm, leading directly to the rate constant, whereby the
side reaction is not related to the main reaction.47−49 The evaluation
method for the reusability capacity of the hybrid microgels is schematically
illustrated in Figure 3a. Here, the reduction rates were assumed to be independent of the
concentration of NaBH4 because a large excess compared
to p-nitrophenol was used.42,50,51 Therefore, the kinetic data were fitted
using a first-order rate law. Moreover, the apparent rate constant
(kapp) was assumed to be proportional
to the surface of the Au nanoparticles present in the system 1  where Ct is the concentration of p-nitrophenol at
any given time (t). Furthermore, kapp is strictly proportional to the total surface area
of the Au nanoparticles (SAu).52,53

Figure 3 (a)
Schematic illustration of experimental method for the reduction
of p-nitrophenol with NaBH4. (b) Representative
time dependence of the absorption of the p-nitrophenolate
ions at 400 nm. The blue line displays the linear section, from which kapp was derived. The induction time (t0) is marked with the black arrow. These data
were obtained using the NGN2-Au system as shown in Figure 4.

In this system, kapp can be easily
obtained from monitoring the absorbance of the p-nitrophenolate
ions at 400 nm as shown in Figures 3b and 4. The generation of p-nitrophenolate ions occurs
immediately after the addition of NaBH4. Indeed, the reaction
becomes stationary and follows a first-order rate law (blue line),
which displays the linear section, from which kapp can be obtained. In addition, there is an induction time
(t0), during which no reduction occurs.
For the catalytic reduction of p-nitrophenol with
a variety of catalysts, it is not unusual to observe induction periods
of minutes.42,54,55 The concentration of [BH4]− has little
effect on the induction. Conversely, the concentration of nitrophenol
greatly affects the induction.56,57 Thus, it has been concluded
that the induction time is related to a surface restructuring necessary
to activate the metal nanoparticle catalysts. Chen et al. have demonstrated
that a time scale of minutes may well be caused by processes related
to a dynamic restructuring of the surface of the nanoparticles.58,59 They found a time scale for spontaneous surface restructuring of
60–250 s. For the reduction of nitrophenol in this study, we
also determined the range of the time scale of t0 (Figures 3b and 4). However, the relation between t0 and the surface restructuring has been derived
solely from kinetic data, and direct evidence from structural studies
remains elusive. Moreover, in this study, the total surface areas
of the Au nanoparticles used in the reaction were identical (1 ×
1015 nm2), which allows comparing all cases
by kapp.

Figure 4 Time dependence of the absorption of the p-nitrophenolate
ions at 400 nm during the reaction using the tested free and immobilized
Au nanoparticles in each microsphere template. The photographs show
each dispersion after the reaction. The blue lines represent the linearly
fitted data for kapp.

Figure 5a
shows
the rate constant of the tested hybrid microgels, including the free
Au nanoparticles, as a function of reaction steps. The free Au nanoparticles,
obtained from a reduction using citric acid, whereby the particles
were coated with carboxylic acid, aggregated and precipitated during
the reaction (Figure 4). The NG-Au hybrid microspheres also aggregated during
the reaction. Therefore, it is desirable that the Au nanoparticles
are not present on the surface of the carriers. For the NGN1-Au hybrid microgels, where the pNIPAm shell is presented on the surface
of the core NG microspheres (Figures 1b and 2b), aggregation
was not observed at the first reaction and the subsequent recovery
of the hybrid microgels was successful. However, when the second reaction
was conducted, kapp diminished to less
than 50% under concomitant aggregation (Figures 4 and 5a). Indeed,
after the first reaction, the size and size distribution of the Au
nanoparticles localized on the core–shell NGN1 microgels increased from 2.7 ± 1.3 to 3.8 ± 2.1 nm (Figure 5b), which suggested
that the Au nanoparticles were close to each other, thus effectively
diminishing the surface area of the Au nanoparticles during the reaction
and recovery.

Figure 5 (a) Rate constant kapp for
the tested
hybrid microgels and free Au nanoparticles as a function of the reaction
steps. The raw data for the reduction of p-nitrophenol
and the photographs for the aggregation are shown in Figure S3. TEM images of the (b) NGN1-Au and
(c) NGN2-Au hybrid microgels before and after the catalytic
reaction. The average size and size distribution of the Au nanoparticles
within the NGN1 and NGN2 core–shell
microgel templates are also displayed (N = 300).

In contrast, the NGN2-Au hybrid microgels, where the
longer pNIPAm shell was present on the surface of the NG core (Figures 1c
and 2c), exhibited excellent reusability behavior
(Figure 5a). At the
first reaction, kapp was comparable to
that of the tested free Au nanoparticles, as well as to those of the NG-Au and NGN1-Au microgels, indicating that
the pNIPAm shell does not disturb the diffusion of p-nitrophenol. Therefore, in the NGN microgel systems
in this study that have an open structure, p-nitrophenol
can diffuse in the pNIPAm shell and reach the Au nanoparticles on
the core more quickly. Moreover, the recovery and redispersion of NGN2-Au were easily accomplished and lead to adequate results
for the second and third reaction, that is, kapp did not change significantly, and the aggregation behavior
was not observed (Figure 5a). Furthermore, we were able to confirm the reuse of NGN2-Au more than three times. Here, as evident from the TEM
images observed after the third reaction, the average size and size
distribution were close to that observed before the first reaction
(Figure 5c). Therefore,
the pNIPAm shell offers the benefits of the Au nanoparticles, that
is, high dispersion stability and diffusion passage of the substrate.
Note that NGN1-Au microgels aggregated at the second
reaction as mentioned above (Figures 4 and 5), although the pNIPAm
shell was also presented on the NG core. Indeed, Dh values of NGN1 and NGN2 microgels were decreased in the presence of p-nitrophenol,
where their concentration of 0.1 mM was used for the reaction (Figure S3). It suggested that the osmotic pressure
in the gel shell was increased and the hydrophobic interaction occurred
between pNIPAm and nitrophenol because the Dh values were further decreased with increasing concentration
of nitrophenol near the room temperature. Thus, in the case of NGN1-Au microgels, the gel shell may not cover the Au nanoparticles
completely during the catalytic reaction, and the NGN2-Au microgels have a sufficient gel thickness in the presence of reaction
substrates.

On the other hand, kapp of the control NGN2-Au(R) hybrid microgels, where the
Au nanoparticles were
randomly distributed over the entire NGN2 template (Figure 2d), was the highest
for all tested hybrid microgels for the first reaction (Figure 5a), suggesting that when the
Au nanoparticles are immobilized in the swollen gel shell, where the
reactive substrates can diffuse and react with the Au nanoparticles
in the gels similar to the free nanoparticles, NGN2-Au(R) hybrid microgels exhibited high catalytic activity compared to those
microgels that contained the Au nanoparticles on the surface of the
core (NGN1-Au and NGN2-Au). However, the NGN2-Au(R) hybrid microgels aggregated during the first reaction
(Figure 4), indicating
that they are not sufficient to fix the nanoparticles in the gels;
indeed, they need to be located at the core surface and covered by
a gel shell.

Conclusions
We applied hybrid core–shell
microgels, wherein Au nanoparticles
were localized only at the surface of the core, to the catalytic reduction
of p-nitrophenol. The hydrogel shell layer can offer
many advantages compared to conventional Au nanoparticles: (i) the
reactive substrate, in this case p-nitrophenol, can
diffuse undisturbedly through the water-swollen gel shell to the Au
nanoparticles and (ii) the gel shell prevents aggregations between
hybrid microgels during the reaction, which is often observed for
free or immobilized Au nanoparticles on the surface of whole carriers.
We thus demonstrated design guidelines for nanoreactors with high
reusability for applications in catalysis. Such hybrid microgel systems
should be applicable to a variety of metallic nanoparticles and may
thus lead to the development of new catalysts for applications that
are aggregation sensitive.

(BIS) (97%), GMA (95%), azobis(amidinopropane)
dihydrochloride (V-50, 95%), and p-nitrophenol (Nit,
99%) were purchased from Wako Pure Chemical Industries (Japan) and
used as received. AET (95%) was purchased from Tokyo Kasei Kogyo Co.,
Ltd. (Japan) and used as received. Chloroauric acid (HAuCl4, 99%) and sodium borohydride (NaBH4, 95%) were purchased
from Junsei Chemical Co., Ltd. (Japan) and used as received. A gold
nanoparticle suspension (5 nm; stabilizer: proprietary surfactant)
as the control was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (USA) and used as
received. Water for all reactions, the preparation of solutions, and
the purification of polymers was distilled and subsequently ion-exchanged
(EYELA, SA-2100E1).

Synthesis of NG and NG Core–pNIPAm
Shell Microgels
The template NG microspheres,
which are composed of NIPAm, GMA, and BIS, were copolymerized in water
using water-soluble V-50 as an initiator (Table 1) according to a previously reported study.19,20 Polymerizations were carried out in a three-necked round-bottom
flask (200 mL) equipped with a mechanical stirrer, condenser, and
nitrogen gas inlet. A mixture of NIPAm (0.2 g), BIS (0.04 g), and
GMA (2.2 g) was dissolved in water (95 mL) and heated to 70 °C
under constant stirring (250 rpm) and a stream of nitrogen. After
30 min to stabilize the solution temperature, V-50 (0.02 g) dissolved
in water (5 mL) was injected to the flask to initiate the polymerization.
The solutions were stirred for 6 h, and after the completion of the
polymerization, the NG microsphere dispersion was cooled
to room temperature. The microspheres were purified via two cycles
of centrifugation/redispersion in water using a relative centrifugal
force (RCF) of 50 000 g.

For the NG core–pNIPAm
shell microgels, seeded precipitation polymerizations were conducted
in the presence of NG microspheres. In this study, two
types of core–shell microgels with different shell thicknesses
were synthesized by tuning the shell monomer concentrations (25 and
40 mM). Mixtures of NG microspheres (0.5 g), NIPAm (0.28
g/25 mM or 0.38 g/40 mM), and BIS (0.006 g/25 mM or 0.01 g/40 mM)
were deposited in a three-necked round-bottom flask (200 mL) equipped
with a mechanical stirrer, condenser, and nitrogen gas inlet. The
solutions were heated to 70 °C under a stream of nitrogen and
constant stirring (250 rpm) and allowed to stabilize for a period
of at least 30 min prior to initiation. An aqueous solution (5 g)
containing V-50 (0.02 g) was added to the flask to initiate the polymerization,
which was then continued for 2 h. The obtained microgels (NGN1 and NGN2) were purified via four cycles of centrifugation/redispersion
in water.

For the modification of the epoxy groups of the inner NG or NGN microgels, 2-AET was added to introduce
amino
groups to the tested microgels. A mixture of NG or NGN microgels (0.4 g), 2-AET (0.78 g), and water (70 g) was
deposited in a glass vial (100 mL) and stirred for 24 h at room temperature
and pH = 11. The thus obtained microgels were purified by centrifugation
using the aforementioned method, followed by 1 week of dialysis.

Synthesis of the Hybrid Microgels
The synthesis of
Au nanoparticles within the prepared microgels is described in detail
elsewhere.19,20 A mixture of template particles
(10 mg) and HAuCl4 (1.0 mg) was stirred for 24 h in an
aqueous medium (10 mL; pH = 2). Afterward, any excess of HAuCl4 was removed by centrifugation, decantation, and washing with
water (pH = 3) to prevent the formation of extraneous Au nanoparticles
on the outside of the microgels. For a random distribution of Au nanoparticles
over the entire NGN2 microgels, the washing process was
not executed and the subsequent reduction of HAuCl4 was
conducted as described below. An aqueous dispersion (10 mL) containing
the particles was poured into a glass vial (30 mL) at 25 °C.
An aqueous solution (1 mL) containing NaBH4 (0.25 mg) was
added dropwise, and the mixture was stirred for 1 h. Then, these hybrid
microgels containing Au nanoparticles were purified by centrifugation/redispersion
(water; RCF: 20 000g. The overall process
for the synthesis of the hybrid microgels is illustrated in Figure S1.

Characterization of the
Hybrid Microgels
The hydrodynamic
diameters of the tested microgels were measured by dynamic light scattering
(Malvern Instruments Ltd., ZetasizerNanoS). The intensity autocorrelation
was calculated for an average of 15 measurements with an acquisition
time of 30 s. The concentrations of the tested microspheres for the
measurements were ∼0.001 wt % in NaCl aqueous solution (1 mM).
The samples were allowed to equilibrate thermally at the desired temperature
for 10 min prior to the measurements. To calculate the hydrodynamic
diameters, the measured diffusion coefficients were used in the Stokes–Einstein
equation (Zetasizer software v6.12).

Microsphere morphologies
in the dried state were visualized by TEM (JEOL2010, operated at 200
kV). For TEM observations, the microsphere dispersions, which were
purified by centrifugation, were dried on a carbon-coated copper grid
(Okenshoji Co., Ltd., Japan).

A quantitative determination of
Au was carried out by ICP-AES (SPS3100,
SII NanoTechnology Inc., Tokyo, Japan). To prepare the calibration
curve for Au, dilutions of Au standard solutions (Wako, 1000 μg/mL)
were measured, which afforded linear calibration plots in the range
of 0.1–10 μg/mL. The emission intensity was measured
at 242.795 nm. For the ICP-AES experiments, the tested hybrid microgels
(concentrations ∼0.01 wt %), which were purified by centrifugation,
were injected into the chamber.

Characterization of the
Catalytic Reaction
As a model
reaction, we chose the reduction of p-nitrophenol
to p-aminophenol using NaBH4.47,48 In a typical run, a specific amount of Au nanoparticles was added
to a solution of p-nitrophenol (0.1 mmol/L). After
mixing these solutions, a specific amount of NaBH4 (10
mmol/L) was added to start the reduction. The kinetic process of the
reduction was monitored by UV–vis spectroscopy (JASCO, V-630iRM)
by measuring the extinction of the solution at 400 nm as a function
of time. In this study, the total surface area (SAu) of Au nanoparticles localized on the tested microspheres
was calculated using SAu = 6/Dρ, where D represents the average size of
Au nanoparticles, which was obtained from TEM images, whereas ρ
refers to the density of the Au nanoparticles (constant). Under the
applied reaction conditions, the SAu values
for the free or hybrid microgels were constant (0.5 m2).
Thus, for catalytic reaction, the concentrations of hybrid microgels
were 0.1 wt % (NG-Au), 0.07 wt % (NGN1-Au), 0.085 wt % (NGN2-Au), and 0.11 wt % (NGN2-Au(R)). Prior to the addition of NaBH4, the solutions containing
the Au nanoparticles were allowed to stabilize for a minimum of 10
min. Then, NaBH4 was added directly into the solution to
start the reaction. For the characterization of the reusability of
the Au nanoparticles, the reaction mixture was transferred into a
centrifuge tube (SC-0200, Ina-Optika Co., Ltd.). The solution was
centrifuged (RCF: 20 000g) to pack the hybrid
microgels at the bottom of the tube. The supernatant was removed from
the tubes without disturbing the hybrid microgels at the bottom. Thereafter,
the pellets of each hybrid microgel were redispersed in a fresh aqueous
solution at 25 °C, and the dispersions were subsequently mixed
for 1 h using a thermomixer (Thermomixer R, Eppendorf) at 25 °C.
The redispersed hybrid microgels were also used for catalysis. The
overall process is illustrated in Figure 3a.
