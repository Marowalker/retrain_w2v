The
DNA double helix is a versatile building block used in DNA
nanotechnology. To potentiate the discovery of new DNA nanoscale assemblies,
recently, silver cations have been introduced to pair DNA strands
by base–Ag+–base bonding rather than by Watson–Crick
pairing. In this work, we study the classical dynamics of a parallel
silver-mediated homobase double helix and compare it to the dynamics
of the antiparallel double helix. Our classical simulations show that
only the parallel double helix is highly stable through the 100 ns
simulation time. A new type of H-bond previously proposed by our collaboration
and recently observed in crystal-determined helices drives the physicochemical
stabilization. Compared to the natural B-DNA form, the metal-mediated
helix has a contracted axial base pair rise and smaller numbers of
base pairs per turn. These results open the path for the inclusion
of this robust metal-mediated building block into new nanoscale DNA
assemblies.

1 Introduction
The
B-DNA double helix form is a pivotal biological structure for
encoding information in living organisms and the basic building block
in current DNA nanotechnology. B-DNA pairs strand antiparallel, one
in the 5′ (phosphoryl) → 3′ (hydroxyl) orientation
and the other in the 3′ → 5′ orientation. This
helical form underpins recent designs for dynamic DNA machines1−3 and self-assembly schemes for elaborate DNA scaffolds4−7 that can control the separation between tethered molecules at sub-angstrom
resolution.8 Yet depending on solution
conditions, such as pH and ionic strength, distinctly different DNA
structures may arise with noncanonical hydrogen (H)-bonding arrangements
that are promoted by various base motifs. These include helical duplexes
with parallel rather than antiparallel strands9,10 and
folded forms, such as i-motifs and guanine (G) quadruplexes, which
contain both parallel and antiparallel pairings.11−14

An important goal of biomolecular
nanotechnology is the manipulation
of the diverse forms of DNA. This has driven extensive research on
alternatives to H-bonding. One attractive approach is base pairing
by metal cations with high nucleobase affinities. This approach has
potential for DNA-based nanomaterials with enhanced thermal, mechanical,
and chemical properties and new functionalities.15−19 Silver cations have received particular attention
due to their low toxicity, with numerous studies in artificial DNA
containing unnatural bases.20−23 (In some cases, these modifications are available
in commercially synthesized strands, albeit at high cost.) In natural
DNA, Ag+-mediated pairings have potentially broader impacts
that have begun to be explored in canonical duplexes with base mismatches24 and in strands without canonical pairings.25−28 However, understanding of structural changes produced by metal-mediated
pairings is limited. This has largely precluded the incorporation
of metal-mediated pairings into DNA nanotechnology, which relies on
the use of well-established B-DNA parameters in sophisticated design
schemes for multistrand assemblies.5,29

Previously,
we studied the shortest possible Ag+-mediated
cytosine (C) homobase duplex, a “tetramer” formed by
Ag+ bridges between two 5′-C2-3′
DNA strands.30 We concluded that in aqueous
solution Ag+ assembles these two-base strands in a parallel
orientation, as supported by comparison of measured and computed circular
dichroism spectra and in agreement with a previous proposal.27 Importantly, our calculations found that main
stabilizing interactions include π–π nucleobase
stacking and a novel interplanar H-bond between C bases in the adjacent
C–Ag+–C pairs. We note that the silver cation
increases the nucleobase–nucleobase distance and can indirectly
affect the formation of (noncanonical) H-bonds. The existence of the
interplanar H-bond was then found in a crystal structure of double
helix forming silver-paired N1-hexylcytosines
(which have no phosphate backbone) firstly and secondly between T–C
and G–C bases in the crystal structure of an antiparallel silver-mediated
DNA double helix. Both crystals support strongly the silver-mediated
homobase forming a double helix in solution, but they leave open questions
about their base and strand orientation and possible i-motif-like
folding.

Here, we investigate whether the distinctive H-bonding,
base orientations,
and strand orientation in the silver-mediated tetramer are also characteristic
of much longer Ag+-paired strands, as could be employed
in designs for DNA nanostructures with regions of metal-mediated pairings.
We employ strand lengths of up to 20 bases to test whether simple
helices are preferred over an i-motif self-folded form. This work
predicts structural parameters of Ag+-paired cytosine homobase
DNA strands using a combination of quantum and classical calculations.
Computationally, we show that a parallel double helix has high stability
through the simulated dynamics, whereas an antiparallel double helix
untwists to be almost nonhelical. The simulations’ atomistic
level of description allows us to identify the main stabilization
mechanisms. The Ag+–base bonds, base–base
stacking interactions, and both planar and novel interplanar H-bonds
all have central roles in the emergence of the double helix. The axis
of the helix corresponds to a central spine of Ag+. This
cationic spine reduces the average linear charge density by a factor
of 2 relative to canonical duplex DNA, contributing to a contracted
rise per base pair and increased rotation per base pair.

These
results open a path for understanding how Ag+-mediated
DNA duplexes in solution can share the outstanding properties of natural
DNA in its double-helix form and open the door for targeted inclusion
of this robust metal-mediated building block into new nanoscale DNA
assemblies with enhanced properties.

2 Results
2.1 Test of the Classical Parameters
Because classical
methods are required to simulate long duplexes,
we must first determine the parameters under which quantum mechanics
and molecular mechanics (QM/MM) dynamics in a solvent are reproduced
by classical dynamics. We used previous results on a silver-mediated
cytosine strand tetramer as a test case for such parameters (parameters
specified in Tables S1 and S2, Supporting
Information (SI)). The parameters are a combination of the improved
AMBER99sb force field31 with the ParmBSC06
nucleic acid parameters,32 our own parameters
for Ag+–base covalent bonds, a Lennard-Jones (LJ)-type
of noncovalent model for the pairs involving Ag+ from the
literature,33 and the use of linear constraint
solver (LINCS) restrictions for the covalent bonds.34 Under these conditions, the classical dynamics simulations
show good agreement with the QM/MM calculations, characterized by
a similar Ag–Ag average distance and the correct formation
of two interplanar H-bonds with significant residence time.

The parameters ParmBSC0632 have been already
tested in parallel and antiparallel quadruplexes (see columns G-DNA
ps and aps in Table 6 in ref (31)) using global geometrical quantities like the minor groove
width and C1′–C1′ interstrand distance. Errors
in minor groove and C1′–C1′ interstrand distance
with respect to measurements are obtained with 3 and 1% for antiparallel
and 3 and 0% for parallel quadruplex, respectively. Our test system,
the tetramer, is a parallel assembly of C-strands mediated by silver
cations. In the QM/MM simulation the average Ag–Ag distance
was 3.5 ± 0.2 Å. A natural test distance to use is then
the Ag–Ag distance because no metallic bond and almost no argentophilic
interaction is expected at such distances. The Ag–Ag distance
is used here as a test of the agreement of the overall solvated structure
and its stabilization mechanisms.

Figure 1a shows
a typical snapshot of our test system, the classical Ag+-paired 5′-C2-3′ solvated atomic structure.
In the classical simulation, we observe a Ag–Ag distance distribution
with one major peak centered at 3.4 Å and one minor “shoulder”
peak at longer Ag–Ag distances (Figure 1c). We can conclude that the short quantum
trajectory with average Ag–Ag distance of 3.5 Å is reproduced
by the first and most probable classical trajectory with Ag–Ag
distance centered at 3.4 Å (corresponding to a 3% error). Importantly,
the classical simulations exhibit the distinctive interplanar H-bonds
found in prior QM simulations30 and crystal-determined
metal-mediated helices35,36 contributing to the structure’s
overall stability. Figure 1d shows the classical O–H distance dynamics on a 50
ns trajectory, indicating ∼2.2 Å as a reasonable bond
cutoff with corresponding classical residence times of 56 and 49%
for the two interplanar H-bonds. Using a time correlation function37 (C(t) = ⟨h(t)h(0)⟩/⟨h(t)⟩, where h(t) = 1 when the H-bond is present and 0 otherwise, with
cutoff radius and angle of 3.5 Å and 30°, respectively)
to estimate the classical H-bond lifetime gave 2.7 ± 0.4 ps,
with the correlation function calculated from 10 different simulations
each with 1 ns duration. Computational resources presently do not
permit QM/MM simulations over long enough times to give a meaningful
comparison of the quantum and classical H-bond lifetimes.

In the following, we apply sets of parameters tested in this
section
to longer chain structures. We explore and compare the two possible
strand orientations.

2.2 Dynamics and Stability
We applied
our AMBER force-field parameters to C11–(Ag+)11–C11 (Figure 2) with both parallel and antiparallel strand
orientations. Despite having similar parameters in the initial configurations,
the duplexes evolved with completely different helicities during the
dynamics.

Figure 2 (a) Parallel and (b) antiparallel helices formed during the classical
simulations of C11–(Ag+)11–C11. (a) A 100 ns snapshot of the parallel helix.
The duplex is very stable and characterized with an average axial
rise per base pair of 3.00 Å and angle twist of 41°. (b)
Antiparallel helix is not stable and unfolds and reforms continuously
during the trajectory, here showing a snapshot at 70 ns. A comparison
of time evolution of average twist angle is shown in Figures S6 and S7, SI.

As previously discussed, base stacking, base hydrophobicity,
and
H-bonding drive natural DNA to emerge as a double helix. In the studied
Ag+-mediated cytosine tetramer, π–π
nucleobase interactions promote the stacking of bases. In addition,
an interbase propeller twist of almost −90° allows the
formation of interplanar H-bonds that in turn decrease the nucleobases’
exposed surface area. Because aromatic base stacking and hydrophobicity
are key interactions in the formation of both Ag+-mediated
cytosine tetramers and B-helices, we used B-form DNA as a template
for the initial structures. These were prepared from a B-form double
helix built by the 3DNA software program38 and then modified to the correct nucleobase content and to the parallel
strand orientation in Figure 3a.

Figure 3 Parallel Ag+-mediated 20 base-long cytosine homobase
double helix from a snapshot at 100 ns of the classical simulation.
The average twist angle is 39°, higher than the twist angle between
stacked C bases in C–G base pairs of B-DNA (34°), corresponding
to a smaller number of bases per turn.

Both initial structures have the same Ag–Ag and Ag–N
distances and no H-bond between cytosine bases. The simulation parameters
are described in detail in “Computational
Methods”, but can be summarized here as a 10 ns constant
temperature and volume (NVT) equilibration and 100 ns constant temperature
and pressure (NPT) production run, where the last 50 ns were used
for analysis. The system’s charge was neutralized by Na+. Figure 2a,b
shows typical snapshots at the end of the simulations. The initial
structures and regularly spaced snapshots can be found in Figures S4 and S5.

In the C11–(Ag+)11–C11 parallel
double helix (Figure 2a), using the last 50 ns of simulations,
the time-averaged Ag–Ag distances range from 3.08 Å in
the center of the helix to 3.35 Å toward the end of the helix,
with an overall average of 3.17 ± 0.09 Å. All Ag–Ag
distances are included in Table S3, SI.
Both interplanar and planar hydrogen bonds are observed throughout
the trajectory. The average number of H-bonds between the cytosine
bases during the last 50 ns simulation is 6.6, using a cutoff N–O
distance of 0.3 nm and O–H–N angle of 20°, including
both planar and interplanar H-bonds. In contrast, the antiparallel
duplex evolves (Figure 2b) to a remarkably different geometrical configuration with a much
longer time-averaged Ag–Ag distance of 4.29 ± 0.16 Å,
in agreement with the absence of H-bonds between the strands. Thus,
even though the initial configuration is prepared close to antiparallel
B-DNA, the dynamics drive the antiparallel Ag+-paired duplex
away from such a structure. The Ag+-mediated parallel DNA
helix stabilized by both Ag–N covalent bonds and H-bonds is
for this reason likely to be more stable than the other parallel DNA
structures only stabilized by H-bonds in reverse Watson–Crick
or Hoogsteen pairs, or than the antiparallel silver-mediated duplex
with no interstrand H-bond. Both the planar and interplanar H-bonds
help stabilize the parallel double-helix structure and therefore play
a key role in the parallel conformation’s preference.

A crystal structure of silver-paired N1-hexylcytosines (which has no phosphate backbone) has been published
recently, which notably displays the presence of interplanar H-bonds
stabilizing a parallel double-helix structure.35 The Ag–Ag distances in silver-paired N1-hexylcytosines crystal are slightly shorter than those
obtained by simulations in average (3.1 Å in the crystal and
3.2 Å in simulated N = 11 helix). The backbone
here may therefore constrain the complex close but away from the nucleobases-only
minimum, allowing at the same time to create a more homogeneous double
helix.

Our antiparallel double-helix simulations also agree
with the more
recent antiparallel silver-mediated double-helix crystal, where there
is no interplanar H-bond between neighboring C–Ag–C
base pairs.36 Such interplanar H-bonds
appear in the crystal linking CG and CT nucleobases. In the antiparallel
silver-mediated double-helix crystal, the Ag–Ag distances are
similar to those obtained in the simulated and slightly longer than
the N1-hexylcytosines crystal.

We
also studied the parallel C20–(Ag+)20–C20 double helix to examine how
the Ag+–DNA parallel double helix evolves as the
length of the DNA strands grows. The initial structure was built by
3DNA. A 100 ns snapshot can be seen in Figure 3, whereas typical snapshots during the MD
simulation are included in Figure S5. Simulation
parameters are described in detail in “Computational
Methods”. The time-averaged Ag–Ag distances do
not show one unique minimum in the center of the helix but rather
several local minima (Table S3, SI). In
both CN Ag+-mediated duplexes,
minimum values are close to each other. There is, accordingly, several
local maxima Ag–Ag distances for the N = 20
duplex that are longer than those in the N = 11 duplex,
where the longest Ag–Ag distances are located only at the end
of the duplex. The overall time-averaged Ag–Ag distance of
the N = 20 duplex is 3.5 ± 0.4 Å. This
very large standard deviation is explained by the presence of the
several local minima and maxima. The average numbers of H-bonds in
Ag+-mediated CN duplexes with N = 2, 11, and 20 are 0.8, 6.6, and 12.3, respectively (about
half the number of Ag+-mediated pairs). Because the three
cases studied share similar geometrical parameters (Ag–Ag minima
distances and relative number of H-bonds), we conclude that the same
base stacking and planar and interplanar H-bonding interactions stabilize
the studied duplexes despite their large differences in the length.
These interactions seem likely to propagate to Ag+-mediated
CN duplexes with N >
20, forming helical-type duplexes with similar geometric parameters.

2.3 Helical Characterization
As a final
step, we characterize our metal-mediated double helices with the help
of the software Curves+.39 We compute values
for the N = 11 and 20 strands. We computed first
the axial rise per base pair hris and
the twist angle htwi, from which the number
of base pairs per turn is derived as 360/htwi. For N = 11 and 20, respectively, we calculated
the time average of the helical averages, and the result is hris = 3.00 ± 0.06 and 3.3 ± 1.1 Å; htwi = 41 ± 1 and 40 ± 1°. The
time evolution is plotted in Figures S6 and S7, SI. The resulting numbers of base pairs per turn are thus 8.7 and
9.2, respectively. Although for both the N = 11 and
20 duplexes the axial rise is smaller than the axial rise of B-DNA
(3.4 Å), the twist angle is higher than the twist angle in CC
steps of B-DNA (33.7°), corresponding to a smaller number of
bases per turn.40

The propeller twist
angles for N = 11 and 20 are, respectively, −29
± 4 and −20 ± 6°. For comparison, CC steps in
B-DNA have a propeller twist angle of −8.11°.41 The increased value in the metal-mediated propeller
twist is in accordance with the presence of interplanar H-bonding.

Looking at the groove parameters, we can distinguish a difference
between the N = 11 and 20 helices. The N = 11 helix is very compact and has a homogeneous set of groove parameters,
whereas the N = 20 helix has kinks in the backbone
and therefore more variability in the groove parameters. The variation
in the groove geometry is correlated to the variation we find in the
Ag–Ag distance along the double helix. In contrast to B-DNA,
which has distinct “major” and “minor”
groove parameters formed by the antiparallel disposition of backbones,
here the parallel disposition allows the short helix to have only
one type of groove. In the case of a natural DNA double helix, it
is well known that the exact parameters are environment- and base-dependent,
causing interconversion between A-, B-, and Z-forms. For the Ag+-paired duplex, we can also expect some dependence on the
nucleobase sequence and the solution counterions, which we plan to
explore in future work.

3 Conclusions
In conclusion,
we introduced and characterized parallel double-helix
metal-mediated cytosine homobase strands. We used quantum simulations
to derive parameters for classical simulations, which showed that
strands with lengths of up to at least 20 bases form a double-helical
duplex with a central Ag+ spine that is stable for an extensive
simulation time (up to 100 ns). Although the duplex completes more
than two full helical turns, simulations show no signs of conversion
to an i-motif self-folded form. Finally, by comparison to simulations
of the antiparallel duplex, which cannot preserve a helical configuration
and presents no interstrand H-bonds, we conclude that the H-bonds
play a central role in stabilizing the metal-mediated double helix.
Because the B-form double helix is the basic building block not only
in the genetic code of living organisms but also in DNA nanotechnology,
metal-mediated double helices may be promising for binding proteins
to alter protein function and for incorporation into self-assembled
DNA nanostructures and dynamic DNA nanomachines. Our results lead
to opportunities for devising new 3D metal-mediated DNA materials
with enhanced resistance to thermal, chemical, and possibly enzymatic
degradation due to the additional stability granted by Ag+-mediated base pairs.19

4 Computational Methods
In this work, we used the Gromacs
4.6 package42 and AMBER99sb force field31 with
the ParmBSC032 nucleic acid parameters
added, for the classical MD simulations. We derived the cation–nucleobase
bonding parameters, including bond stretching, bond angle bending,
and dihedral angle torsion, using potential energies from density
functional theory.43 The energy of each
step was calculated with GPAW code.44 The
Tkatchenko–Scheffler scheme45 in
combination with a gradient-corrected exchange correlation functional
(PBE + TS09) was chosen to account van der Waals dispersion interactions.
In the implementation, the values for the static polarizability and
the van der Waals dispersion coefficient have been taken from Chu
and Dalgarno.46 The bonded parameters for
Ag+–cytosine obtained from energy curves fitting
are listed in Table S1.

Adding Ag+ to cytosine strands rearranges the charge
distribution of atoms. Therefore, the partial charges of the atoms
need to be recalculated. In this work, the atomic partial charges
were optimized with AmberTools12,47 following
the two-step restrained electrostatic potential48 charge-fitting procedure recommended for AMBER. The electron
density used to calculate the electrostatic potential was calculated
by Gaussian 09 with B3LYP function and LANL2DZ basis set.49 Charges were also derived from a C–Ag+–C model system, where deoxyribose molecules are replaced
by CH3. The partial charge of Ag+ is 0.38272.
The charges of other atoms are given in Table S2. The 12-6 Lennard-Jones (LJ) model was used for van der
Waals interactions. The van der Waals radii (Rmin/2) of 1.500 Å and energy parameter (ε) of 0.03899838
kcal/mol were taken for Ag+.33

Unless otherwise specified, all of the molecular dynamics
were
generated using the same procedure. The simulation was performed in
GROMACS with explicit water. Initially, the structure was placed in
a cubic box with at least 1.0 nm of water molecules in each direction.
The structure was then minimized using a steepest-descent algorithm.
After the minimization, 10 ns NVT followed by 10 ns NPT equilibration
was performed. We then performed a 100 ns MD run and used the last
50 ns run for analysis. The MD simulations were run at a constant
pressure of 1.0 bar and temperature of 300 K, with time constants
of 1.0 and 0.1 ps for the pressure and temperature coupling, respectively.
The LINCS algorithm was used to constrain bond lengths, allowing a
time step of 2 fs in the simulations.
