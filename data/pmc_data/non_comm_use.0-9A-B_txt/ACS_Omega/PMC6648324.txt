Ladanein
(i.e., 5,6,7-trihydroxylated flavone) was demonstrated to act as a
powerful virucidal agent toward a broad range of enveloped virus particles.
Fe(III) coordination and pH are indeed among the key parameters that
might favor both bioactivation of the flavone and consequent host
cell entry inhibition. In this present work, the impact of fluorinated
groups on the physicochemical and antiviral properties of the flavone
was investigated, thus allowing a deeper understanding of the antiviral
mode of action. The improved synthesis of ladanein allowed accessing
a broad range of analogues, some of them being significantly more
active than the former ladanein lead compound. We first determined
the acido-basic properties of this homogenous series of compounds
and then investigated their electrochemical behavior. Fe(III) coordination
properties (stability, spectral behavior, and kinetics) of ladanein
and its analogues were then examined (quasiphysiological conditions)
and provided key information of their stability and reactivity. Using
the determined physicochemical parameters, the critical impact of
the iron complexation and medium acidity was confirmed on hepatitis
C virus (HCV) particles (pre)treated with ladanein. Finally, a preliminary
structure–HCV entry inhibition relationship study evidenced
the superior antiviral activity of the ladanein analogues bearing
an electron-withdrawing group in para position (FCF3 > FOCF3 > FFCF3 > FF > FOMe) on the B cycle in comparison with the parent
ladanein itself.

Introduction
Hepatitis C virus (HCV)
is among the most significant and widespread viral diseases that affects
nearly 71 million people worldwide, of whom around 50–80% will
suffer chronic hepatitis that may lead to hepatocellular carcinoma
and ultimately to death. During the last years, research in anti-HCV
drugs has impressively increased, leading to approval of new drugs
that enhance the sustained virologic response rates to greater than
95% across all clinically relevant viral genotypes. However, these
drugs are in use for only a short period of time and it is therefore
difficult to predict if and to what extent viral resistance will necessitate
salvage therapies with alternative mode of action (MoA). Furthermore,
the new therapies are expensive, thus limiting access to therapy in
resource-poor areas of the world. Therefore, there is still a need
for evaluation and development of alternative and/or complementary
treatment strategies. These compounds may be combined to other well-known
drugs to reach an all-oral therapy or treat complications arising
from liver transplantation, for which current therapies are still
not convenient.

Flavonoids including flavones produced by nutritive
plants were shaped by evolution by enhancing both animal and human
health, playing pleiotropic effects, and showing low capability to
induce drug resistance.1 A preparative
bioactivity-guided fractionation approach allowed identifying a novel
antiviral lead, the flavone ladanein (Figure 1) that displays an unusual 5,6,7-trihydroxylated
substitution pattern on its cycle A. Ladanein was then prepared through
a scalable and versatile synthetic route, and its peculiar antiviral
properties were confirmed.2,3 On the other hand, mechanistic
investigations showed that ladanein exposure of lipid-enveloped HCV
virions prevented the infection in a postattachment entry step. By
contrast, ladanein exposure of surface-bound virions or cellular targets
had a reduced or even almost no antiviral effect. Ladanein was demonstrated
to act on all major HCV genotypes, including a variant that is resistant
to a reference entry inhibitor.4 Concomitantly,
the active natural ladanein-enriched fractions were shown to contain
high Cu and Fe levels that suggested that the virucidal activity of
ladanein (i.e., Fe(III)- and pH-related bioactivation)4 is intimately linked to its physicochemical properties
(i.e., acid–base, redox, and metal complexation).5 The former synthesis of ladanein was significantly
improved and allowed preparing multigram amount of the flavone.6 This present work was focused on the synthesis
and investigation of the physicochemical properties (i.e., spectroscopy,
protonation, electrochemistry, Fe(III) complexation, and formation
kinetics) of six new synthetic ladanein analogues (negletein and fluorinated
derivatives, Figure 1, see the Supporting Information for the
characterization of the new ladanein analogues). Particular attention
was paid on the impact of the introduction of fluorinated groups to
the flavone core on the physicochemical and antiviral properties,
allowing a much deeper understanding of the MoA of these promising
antiviral compounds.

Results and Discussion
Structural Properties
In this section, the X-ray structural data obtained for ladanein FOMe and its final precursor FPOMe will be discussed
with respect to closely related flavones (see Figure S1 and Table 1). To the best of our knowledge, these X-ray data are the
scarce ones available for this class of compounds (i.e., displaying
a 5,6,7-trisubstitution on cycle A). The differences in packing of
the two solid-state structures of ladanein originate mainly from a
methanol molecule present in the crystal lattice, which cocrystallizes
with synthetic ladanein and interacts with the 5- and 6-OH groups
through hydrogen bonds (Figure 2).

For flavones containing a 4′-methoxy
substituent, mesomeric effects from the OCH3 donor to the
4-carbonyl acceptor unit (Scheme 1) likely account for the small torsion angle (O1–C2–C1′–C2′) measured between the B ring and the coplanar A–C
benzopyran moiety (Table 1).

Scheme 1 Mesomeric Effects for Ladanein Induced by the 4′-OCH3
The C2–C1′ bond distances
range from 1.46 Å for synthetic ladanein to 1.48 Å for 5,7,3′-trihydroxy-6,4′,5′-trimethoxyflavone,
in agreement with an sp2–sp2 σ
bond (i.e., a length of 1.48 Å is expected for Csp2–Csp2 bond). The C2–C3 bond lengths were found to be slightly longer
than a pure double bond due to conjugation (i.e., a bond length of
1.34 Å is expected for a pure double bond), similar to the C4–O4 bond lengths that are increased (e.g.,
baicalein, salvigenin, ladanein, and eupatorin) compared with flavones
having a larger dihedral angle (i.e., a length of 1.22 Å is expected
for a C=O double bond).14 These
structural features can be explained by the mesomeric effects depicted
in Schemes 1 and 2. In addition, the increased
length of the C4–O4 double bond may be
also explained by a strong intramolecular hydrogen bond between O4 and O5H (Table 1). For FPOMe, the C4–O4 (1.24 Å) and C2–C3 (1.34
Å) bond lengths tend toward the expected values for isolated
C=O and C=C double bonds, respectively.

Scheme 2 Mesomeric
and Prototropic Effects That Can Explain the Structural Features Observed
for Ladanein and Its Analogues
Conformational energy investigation of the flavonoid backbone
indicated that the lowest potential energy (i.e., that corresponds
to a nonplanar conformation) involves a torsion angle O1–C2–C1′–C2′ of about 22.8°.15 This torsion angle
constitutes a reasonable compromise between attractive (i.e., from
a planar structure that provides the framework for an extensive mesomeric
effect) and repulsive steric interactions (i.e., that result from
the vicinity of the orthohydrogens of the B ring with the C ring).
The difference in energy between the lowest energy of the nonplanar
conformation versus the planar one is, however, weak (ca. 0.7 kcal
mol–1). In the absence of mesomeric driving force,
the torsion angle O1–C2–C1′–C2′ was found to range from
8.52 to 20.01° (e.g., baicalein). The exocyclic oxygen O4 along with the B-ring substitution pattern are therefore
essential to maintain the planarity of the flavone structure. Inducing
a partial negative charge on O4 via hydrogen bonding strengthens
the contribution of this mesomeric effect and then contributes to
the planarity of the molecule (Scheme 2). On the other hand, baicalein displays a strong hydrogen
bond (1.74–1.85 Å for O5H–O4) and two weaker hydrogen bonds (2.42–2.54 Å for O6H–O5, 2.20–2.23 Å for O7H–O6) and adopts an anticlockwise orientation.16 Salvigenin (1.68 Å for O5H–O4) only possesses one strong hydrogen bond. For ladanein, the
situation is at odds with a strong hydrogen bond between O4 and O5H (1.62–1.71 Å, anticlockwise orientation),
whereas O6H establishes a weaker interaction with O7CH3 (2.21–2.33 Å) with a clockwise
orientation (see Figure S2).

Acido-Basic
Properties
Due to their sparing solubility in water (ca.
10–5–10–4 M), UV–vis
absorption spectrophotometric titrations versus pH of the ladanein
analogues were carried out in CH3OH/H2O (80/20
w/w). This allowed calculating the protonation constants of the 6-OH
unit (Table 2) as well
as the electronic spectra of the corresponding protonated species
(see Figures S3–S9). The protonation
constant of the 5-OH group could not be measured under our experimental
conditions. With respect to the 5-OH-flavone (pKa = 11.44 in dioxane/water 1/1 w/w17 and pKa = 11.34 in CH3OH/water
1/1 w/w18), the 5-OH pKa values were estimated to be >12 due to a strong intramolecular
hydrogen bond with the neighboring β-carbonyl group.19 The acido-basic properties were compared to
the rare physicochemical data that are reported for related flavones
(scutellarin B = 5,6,4′-trihydroxy-7-O-glucuronide-flavone).
At first sight, the pKa values are not
markedly influenced by the substituents of the B cycle. For example, FOMe displays a slightly more basic 6-OH, which likely originates
from the +M directing effect of the 4′-methoxy group (Scheme 1) that affects the
2-phenyl-chromone unit. Similarly, the basicity of the 6-OH function
slightly increases in the case of the final precursor FPOMe (absence of O4–HO5 hydrogen bond) and FFCF3 (steric interaction). Nevertheless,
these differences remain small and under physiological conditions,
all flavones display the same neutral state.

Table 3 gathers the absorption spectrophotometric

previously shown that its electronic transitions (highest occupied
molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO)
calculated at the density functional theory (DFT) level, PCM-TD-M06)
involved the system as a whole.5

The HOMO electronic density is mainly
centered on ladanein A ring, whereas that of the LUMO is mostly localized
on the B and C rings. The peak at 335 nm measured for ladanein (computed
value of 328 nm with a large oscillator strength f = 0.78) was attributed to a HOMO–1–LUMO transition
with a small HOMO–LUMO contribution, so that it can be considered
as a π–π* transition with a small charge-transfer
(CT) character. In addition, time-dependent DFT experiments predicted
a weak HOMO–LUMO transition at 351 nm (f =
0.04) presumably hidden in the foot of the intense band centered at
335 nm.

For FH, FF, FCF3, FFCF3, and FOCF3 that are lacking
a (+M) OCH3 substituent in the B ring (i.e., the B substituents
are mainly −I or −M directing groups),21−23 the pH increase induces weak hypo- or hyperchromic shifts of bands
II and I, respectively (Table 1). Alike FOMe and FPOMe, an absorption
band of significantly lower intensity emerges at ∼450 nm upon
deprotonation of the 6-OH unit. This new absorption band is undoubtedly
associated to the nature of the B-cycle substituent (λmax = 395 nm for FPOMe to 446 nm for FCF3) and was attributed (e.g., ladanein5) to a HOMO–LUMO transition, the molecular
orbital (MO) topology being unaltered for the anionic state with respect
to the neutral one, with however a stronger contribution on the deprotonated
oxygen in the HOMO. These data are thus in agreement with a resonance
effect (Scheme 1) that
affects the electronic properties of the molecule (i.e., donor–acceptor
system).

Electrochemical Properties
The electrochemical properties
of ladanein and its synthetic analogues (Figure 1) were then investigated using cyclic voltammetry
(CV). To assess the role of the carbonyl unit of the C ring, 2-phenyl-chromone F was used as a model. For the sake of solubility, the electrochemical
experiments conducted on FOMe and its analogue were carried
out in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). First, Figure 3 depicts the CVs of FOMe and
its analogues that were recorded from −0.8 to 1.2 V. The repetitive
scans were found to be reproducible, thus indicating the absence of
adsorption processes and degradation products. Regardless of the sweep
rate (i.e., 0.05–6 V s–1), FOMe is characterized by a chemically irreversible oxidation (wave I)
and a broadened irreversible reduction (wave II) in the reverse scan.
These features are typical of catechol-based molecules characterized
by an ECE-type mechanism (see Figure S10).24 The comparable CV profiles measured
for ladanein and its analogues (Figure 3) suggest that a common electrochemical behavior is
shared and dominates whatever the substitution on the B ring (vide
supra, acido-basic properties). The comparison with 2-phenyl-chromone F further established that the redox processes are related
to the A ring containing the catechol-type moiety.

Figure 3 CV of FOMe compared to that of its synthetic analogues. Cyclic voltammograms
measured for ∼2–2.5 mM flavone in DMSO at a sweep rate
of 200 mV s–1. Solvent: DMSO; I = 0.1 M n-Bu4NPF6; T = 25 °C; reference electrode = KCl(3 M)/Ag/AgCl;
working electrode = glassy carbon (GC) disk of 0.07 cm2 area; counterelectrode = Pt wire.

The linear dependencies of log(ip) versus log(v) indicated that the redox processes
are diffusion-controlled in DMSO (i.e., the slope value of the linear
log(ip) = f(log(v)) variation ranges from 0.48 to 0.63; see Table S1 and Figures S11–S17). A slope
value of ∼0.5 reflects diffusion-controlled electrode processes,
whereas a slope value close to 1.0 indicates adsorption-controlled
processes.25 For most of the flavones,
the variation of Epa (or Epc) as a function of log(v) (see Table S1 and Figures S18–S24) suggested
a mixed kinetic control by both an electron transfer and a chemical
reaction. Kinetic control by slow electron transfer (i.e., overpotential
process induced by limited reaction kinetics) is evidenced at higher
sweep rates.26

For instance, this
process was already reported for catechol, caffeic acid,27 dihydrocaffeic acid, and caffeic acid phenethyl
ester in DMSO24 and is not influenced by
the structural differences among these four compounds. It results
from the competition between deprotonation and radical cation delocalization,
with the first process being the most favored one. We then examined
the dependence of the current function (ip/v1/2) on v, which is
another diagnostic criterion to the mechanism of electron transfer.28 For simple reversible or irreversible reactions,
horizontal variations are expected, whereas increase (or decrease)
of (ip/v1/2) with v is related to charge transfers coupled
with chemical reactions.28 Regardless of
the flavone, the variation of (ip/v1/2) as a function of v (see Figures S25–S30) clearly supported coupled
charge transfers related with chemical reactions. The (ip/v1/2) ratios vary for v < ∼1 V s–1 (i.e., coupled
chemical reaction following an electron transfer), whereas a mechanism
transition was observed with no marked variation for v > 1 V (i.e., deprotonation that alters the electron transfer
kinetics; reaction overpotential).

To better address this rate-determining
step, a Tafel parameter (noted b) was next evaluated
for ladanein FOMe (see Figure S31) using the following equation29 valid
for an irreversible diffusion-controlled process. 1  with βnβ (i.e., charge-transfer
coefficient with β = symmetry factor and nβ = total number of electrons transferred in this charge-transfer
step). The rate constant of the chemical reaction (i.e., deprotonation)
following the electron transfer can be thus evaluated (kH = 0.1(Fvi/RT)) where vi is the scan rate at the intercept
of the two straight lines. For FOMe, the rates of the
chemical reaction (i.e., deprotonation of phenols) were estimated
to be ∼2.8 and 3.0 s–1 for the anodic and
cathodic processes, respectively.

For an irreversible process,
it is expected (eq 1)
that the cathodic (or anodic) shift in peak potential (or half-peak
potential) is ∼30 mV/βnβ. Assuming only the sweep rates ranging from 0.050 to 1 V s–1, the βnβ values for the
cathodic signals were found to be close to the theoretical value (i.e.,
βnβ = 0.5 for an elementary
1e– transfer with nβ = 1 and β = 0.5).28 For the anodic
signals, the βnβ values are
close to a theoretical value of βnβ = 0.25. This approach is valid only if the electrode process consists
of a single elementary step that involves the simultaneous release
of electrons from the electrode to the reactant. In most cases, an
electrode process consists of a sequence of consecutive (or parallel)
elementary electron transfers and chemical reactions. In this context,
the above approach is formally correct only if the first step of the
sequence imposes the rate of the whole process and involves the simultaneous
release of n electrons from the electrode.30

To diagnose the irreversibility of our systems and evaluate
the charge-transfer coefficients, the following equation31 was then used28 2  with Ep = Epa (or Epc), Ep/2 = the potential determined at ip/2, and βnβ, the charge-transfer coefficient (see Figures S32–S38). In a multistep electrode process characterized
by a sequence of consecutive elementary steps, the electrode kinetics
is affected only by the rate-determining step and by the steps that
precede it. The electrode kinetics is not controlled by the following
steps that may involve further electron transfers (i.e., not the case
herein). For ladanein (see Table S1 for
the other flavones), the charge-transfer coefficients βnβ were calculated to be 0.44 and 0.40
for the anodic and cathodic signals, respectively. Assuming a 1e– transfer in the limiting charge-transfer process,
the factor coefficient was estimated to be close to 0.5 for both the
cathodic and anodic processes, in agreement with the measured data
above.

Figure 4 now depicts the variation of ipa and ipc for ladanein as a function of v0.5.

Figure 4 Variation of ipa and ipc as a function of the square root of v (v = sweep rate in mV s–1) for ladanein (2.32 mM). Solvent: DMSO; I = 0.1
M n-Bu4NPF6; T = 25 °C; reference electrode = KCl(3 M)/Ag/AgCl; working electrode
= GC disk of 0.07 cm2 area; counterelectrode = Pt wire.

No adsorption processes are expected
since ipa and ipc follow a linear dependence with the ordinate at the origin being
equal to 0, thus confirming diffusion-controlled reactions. The current
intensity ip for an irreversible system
can be expressed as follows 3  where A is the area
of the working electrode (0.07 cm2), n is the total number of electrons exchanged, βnβ is the charge-transfer coefficient, D0 is the diffusion coefficient (cm2 s–1), C0 is the concentration of the electroactive
species (mol cm–3), and v is the
sweep rate (V s–1).

Using βnβ values for the anodic and the cathodic processes
(see Table S1) and using the D0 value (i.e., from diffusion-ordered spectroscopy NMR,
2.34 × 10–6 cm2 s–1 for ladanein, Figure S39), the total
number of electrons involved in the anodic and cathodic process was
estimated to be close to 2 (see Table S2). The differences observed can be explained by the inaccurate estimates
of the n(βnβ) and D0 values rather than a different
electrochemical behavior. These electrochemical data are therefore
in agreement with a 2e– oxidation/deprotonation
ECE of the A-catechol, with the first electron transfer being the
rate-limiting step (Scheme 3). The electrochemical response of FOMe and its
analogues in DMSO is similar to that measured for closely related
compounds (vide supra).

Scheme 3 Suggested Electrochemical Behavior of Ladanein
and Its Analogues within the Potential Range Considered (from −1.2
to 0.8 V) in DMSO
From −2.35 to −1 V, an additional quasireversible
electrochemical signal was observed (Figure 5) and was attributed to the C-ring enone
moiety in agreement with 2-phenyl-chromone (see Figures S40–S41). The anodic (Epa)-to-cathodic (Epc) peak separations
(ΔEp) were found to be higher than
expected for reversible one-electron transfer, thus substantiating
quasireversibility of the corresponding redox process (see Table S3 and Figures S42–S48). In most
cases, the ipa-to-ipc ratios were found to be lower than 1, also in agreement
with a quasireversible process (see Table S3). This likely originates from disproportionation or side reactions
(e.g., dimerization, vide infra). Regardless of the flavone considered,
the intensities of the cathodic (ipc)
and anodic (ipa) signals vary linearly
with v0.5 in agreement with a (quasi)reversible
behavior. These redox reactions are diffusion-controlled and suggest
the absence of adsorption processes (see Figures S49–S55). With the exception of the final precursor
(FPOMe), the E1/2 sequence
(see Table S3) fairly follows the λmax sequence of either band I or band II (vide supra), confirming
the key role of the carbonyl group in each of these processes.

flavones that demonstrate the effect of the substitution of the B
ring on the quasireversible signal arising from the carbonyl unit.

Literature data indicated that
the 2-phenyl-chromone is characterized by a one-electron reversible
wave (E1/2 at −2.28 V) and a two-electron
wave (E1/2 at −2.85 V vs Ag/Ag+ in dimethylformamide (DMF) at 298 K).32 On the other hand, electrochemical measurements on 7-acetoxyflavone
and 7-hydroxyfavone showed a two-electron irreversible reduction at Epc = −1.77 and −1.44 V/CSE, respectively
(i.e., DMF at v = 200 mV s–1).33 These diffusion-controlled electrode processes
were found to be influenced by the substituents due to extended conjugation,
as observed for our ladanein analogues. Under our experimental conditions,
a single quasireversible signal (E1/2 =
−1.59 V/KCl(3 M)/Ag/AgCl) was evidenced for F.
This apparent one-electron process is proposed to lead to a monoradical
species, which was confirmed in previous studies by electron paramagnetic
resonance spectroscopy. No additional redox signal was evidenced when
the potential range was expanded to values that are more negative.
The reversible redox wave observed for FOMe (i.e., E1/2 = −1.93 V/KCl(3 M)/Ag/AgCl measured
at 200 mV) was therefore proposed to be associated with the reduction
of the flavone carbonyl (Scheme 4). A cathodic shift of ∼340 mV is indeed observed
between FOMe and F. This property is mainly
due to the electronic effects of the substituents on the A and B rings
as well as the hydrogen bond between the carbonyl and 5-OH groups.
The comparison of FH to F also shows a cathodic
shift of 280 mV, thus demonstrating that the substitution pattern
of A ring induces the largest shift, whereas the methoxylation of
the B ring only shifts the E1/2 value
of about 60 mV with respect to FH. Withdrawing of the
hydrogen bond with the β-carbonyl by methylation of the 5-OH
(FPOMe) induces an extra cathodic shift of 190 mV with
respect to ladanein FOMe. This suggests that FPOMe is electrochemically more inert with respect to carbonyl reduction
and highlights the key role of this hydrogen bond in the electrochemical
activation/behavior of the flavone.

Scheme 4 Suggested Side Reactions
upon One-Electron Reduction of the Enone Unit
The
reduction of the carbonyl unit is likely the plausible redox pathway.

In contrast to the above experiments, scanning
the potential from −2.35 to 1.2 V alters the CV behavior of
ladanein FOMe and its analogues with the presence of
additional reduction and oxidation signals (Figure 6).

Figure 6 CV of FOMe (2.32 mM) showing the
formation of additional electrochemical signals when scanning the
potential from −2.35 to 1.2 V. Solvent: DMSO; I = 0.1 M n-Bu4NPF6; T = 25°C; v = 200 mV s–1; reference electrode = KCl(3 M)/Ag/AgCl; working electrode = GC
disk of 0.07 cm2 area; counterelectrode = Pt wire.

A new anodic peak markedly appears
at −0.11 V, whereas the catechol-centered anodic peak is shifted
from 0.72 to 0.64 V. In addition, three new cathodic peaks appear
at −0.30, −1.07, and −1.62 V. Last, the reduction
peak (i.e., centered on A ring) is also shifted from 0.18 to 0.23
V. This peculiar electrochemical behavior can be related to the formation
of degradation products (e.g., resulting from pinacol coupling reaction34 or hydrodimerization35) of two radicals formed upon reduction of the enone unit, as shown
in Scheme 4.

Iron Coordination
Properties
Previously,5 we have
shown that ladanein affords monoferric monochelates under acidic conditions
(i.e., employed to prevent the formation of insoluble (hydr)oxo Fe(III)
species). Of the two bidentate binding sites, the β-hydroxy-ketone
group of ladanein was shown to be the most effective one. Monoferric
monochelates under protonated and hydroxylated states were also evidenced
and quantified. The pFe value calculated for FOMe was
compared to that of relevant natural chelators (e.g., polyphenols,
siderophores, etc.) and emphasized that the moderate Fe(III) binding
capability of ladanein is in excellent agreement with the ability
of ferrioxamine B (DFO) to inhibit its antiviral activity.5 To go a step further, we provide in Table 4 spectroscopic properties
as well as conditional stability constants of the metal complexes
with the ladanein analogues that were measured at pH 2.0. With the
exception of FF, the analogues are characterized by binding
affinities for Fe(III) similar to FOMe. For analogues
displaying an electron-withdrawing substituent on the B ring (FFCF3, FCF3, FF, and FOCF3), the ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT) is bathochromically
shifted by ∼20 nm in regard to FOMe or FH. This can be ascribed to the electronic impacts induced by these
substituents on the carbonyl unit. These observations substantiate
the key role of the carbonyl group in Fe(III) complexation and confirm
the role of the β-hydroxy-carbonyl unit as the relevant bidentate
binding site.

To mimic the physiological conditions, the Fe(III)
binding abilities of ladanein and its analogues were next examined
at pH 7.4 in a CH3OH/H2O solvent (80/20 w/w).
Nitrilotriacetic acid NTA was employed as a supporting
ligand to prevent Fe(III) hydrolysis into insoluble species (at pH
7.4, log K*FeNTA =
6.0(3); see Figure S56).5 For instance, Figure 7 depicts the UV–vis absorption titration of FFCF3 as a function of [FeNTA]0 (see Figures S57–S62). Regardless of the flavone employed, ternary flavone·FeNTA complexes were systematically characterized and quantified.

To go further and confirm the formation of the ternary ferric
complexes, electrospray mass spectra were recorded (negative mode).
Regardless of the flavone, ternary Fe(III) complexes were characterized
(Table 5 and see Figure S63 for FOMe) in agreement
with the absorption spectrophotometric study. For FH, FOCF3, and FF, other
ferric species involving additional FeNTA units were
also characterized and likely originate from adducts induced by the
electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) conditions.

The binding constants and absorption spectroscopic
parameters have been gathered in Table 6. Similar to catecholate-based ligands,36 the LMCT absorptions of the ternary complexes
lie at much higher energies. The presence of NTA induces
a hypsochromic shift of the LMCT absorptions that ranges from 31 nm
(FFCF3) to 62 nm (FOMe). With the trianionic NTA, the Lewis acidity of the
metallic center significantly decreased and its d orbitals are therefore destabilized. This effect is significant
for flavones displaying electron-donating groups (FOMe), whereas it remains limited for flavones with electron-withdrawing
substitution (FFCF3 and FCF3).

masked by the flavone transitions.

Even though the stability constants related to FeNTA binding are close within the given experimental errors,
ladanein FOMe seems to be among the less active binders
as its constant was found to be the lowest one with respect to that
of its synthetic analogues. Electron-withdrawing substitutions in
the B ring seemingly strengthen FeNTA binding, the more
efficient binder from the ladanein analogue series being the FFCF3 system (Table 6 and Figure 7).

Uptake of Fe(III) by Ladanein under Acidic
Conditions
Using stopped-flow spectrophotometry, kinetic
studies were first performed under acidic conditions. Under these
experimental conditions, the LHFe2+ complex
(i.e., L = fully deprotonated state of ladanein FOMe) corresponds to the predominant ferric complex, whereas
Fe3+ and Fe(OH)2+ are the major free iron(III)
species (see Figure S64, KFe(OH)2+ = 10–1.39).37 The formation kinetics was monitored under pseudo-first-order
conditions ([Fe3+]0 > 10 × [FOMe]0) at λ = 650 nm, which corresponds to the largest
absorption spectrophotometric difference between the reactants (Fe3+ + LH2) and the product LHFe2+. A single rate-limiting step was evidenced in the
second time span, and no signal loss was observed during the dead
time (∼3 ms) of the kinetic device (Figure 8). The absorbances at the end of the rate-limiting
step satisfactorily correspond to the calculated values for the LHFe2+ complex. In all cases, the absorbance followed
an exponential growth versus time, indicating first-order kinetics
(v = −d[L]/dt = kobs[L]) with respect
to the ligand. A slower biphasic kinetic process (i.e., minute time
span) likely related to the iron(III)-mediated oxidation of ladanein
was also observed (Figure 8). This suggests that Fe(III) complexation leads to flavone
oxidation even under acidic conditions, whereas the free ligand remained
unaltered over a long period in the absence of Fe(III) under these
experimental conditions. This substantiates that Fe(III) chelation
might favor specific C,C- (or C,O) oxidative coupling reactions or
auto-oxidation processes.38

Figure 8 Variation of the absorbance
(LMCT at 650 nm) as a function of time for the formation of ladanein
ferric complexes. The inset shows the variation of the absorbance
at 650 nm that likely corresponds to the slower oxidation of ladanein
mediated by iron(III) complexation. Solvent: CH3OH/H2O (80/20 w/w); I = 0.1 M (NEt4ClO4); T = 25.0 ± 2 °C; [H+]0 = 0.032 M; [FOMe]0 =
3.83 × 10–5 M; [Fe]0 = 3.09 ×
10–4 M.

For [H+]0 ranging from 9.4 × 10–3 to 3.2 × 10–2 M, [Fe(III)]0 (i.e., in excess) was varied and the pseudo-first-order rate
constants (kobs) were calculated (see Figure S65). Under these experimental conditions,
Fe3+ and Fe(OH)2+ predominate in solution and
ladanein is fully protonated (LH2). The following
mechanism can therefore be suggested 4   5   6  The rate law relative to LH2 is hence   7  which becomes eq 5 if [Fe3+] and [Fe(OH)2+] are
expressed as a function of KH and [Fe(III)]0.   8  Figure 9 presents the variation of ka versus
[H+]0 according to eq 5. LHFe+ is formed
through two pathways involving either Fe3+ (kFe3+ = 4.3(1.6) × 102 M–1 s–1) or Fe(OH)2+ (kFe(OH)2+ = 2.7(2) × 103 M–1 s–1). The kFe3+ value reflects an associative ligand interchange
mechanism (Ia) and is dependent on the
nature of the incoming ligand that substitutes the first water molecule
(Table 7).39,40 By contrast, Fe(OH)2+ undergoes a dissociative ligand
interchange mechanism (Id) (Eigen–Wilkins)
and its rate-limiting step corresponds to the loss of the first water
molecule (i.e., not dependent on the nature of the entering ligand).41,42 The kFe(OH)2+ rate constant
measured for the ladanein ferric complex compares well with those
reported for siderophores, polyphenols, or hydroxycarboxylate chelators
(Table 7).39

Formation Kinetics of the Flavone·FeNTA
Complexes
The Fe(III) binding kinetics by natural chelators
(e.g., polyphenols, siderophores) or analogues have been extensively
investigated under acidic conditions.41,42 Such conditions
are convenient but far from being relevant to account for physiological
conditions. In the human body, Fe(III) is usually exposed to pH 7.4
and always bound to proteins (e.g., hemoglobin, transferrin) or low-molecular-weight
moderate chelators (e.g., citrate) to maintain its solubility. In
model systems, polyamino-carboxylate-based chelators, such as citrate
and NTA, are therefore used to ensure iron solubility.51,53−57NTA is a relevant citrate model and belongs to the
most studied organic chelators.58,59 The Fe(III) uptake
kinetics by ladanein, two of its analogues (i.e., FCF3, FFCF3), and apigenin were then investigated at pH 7.4 (physiological conditions)
in the presence of NTA. The kinetic study was carried
out in excess flavone (i.e., pseudo-first-order conditions) with 1
equiv of NTA with respect to the ferric cation. A single
exponential signal was observed for FOMe, apigenin, and FCF3, whereas a two rate-limiting
step sequence was evidenced for FFCF3 (Figures 10 and S66–S68). The extrapolated
initial absorbances match very well with the absorbances of the reagents
(flavone + FeNTA), thus demonstrating that no fast step
was lost during the mixing of the reagents (∼3 ms). The final
absorbance values agreed very well with the values calculated for
these ternary complexes flavone·FeNTA. Interestingly,
no oxidation of the flavones (Figure 10) was observed. This is in contrast to the observations
made for FOMe with Fe(III) under acidic conditions (vide
supra). This indicates that NTA binding likely alters
the redox properties of the metal complexes, as suggested by the hypsochromic
shift of the LMCT band (Table 6). Auxiliary ligands seemingly shield ladanein from spontaneous
Fe-promoted oxidation and can thus constitute a simple and useful
method to improve its bioavailability and activity in vivo.

of the ternary ferric complex with ladanein and NTA.
Inset shows the absorbance variation over a much longer time, demonstrating
the absence of oxidation of ladanein triggered by Fe(III) complexation.

± 2 °C; pH = 7.4 (0.1 M HEPES); [FeNTA]0 = 2.30 × 10–5 M; [FOMe]0 = 5.82 × 10–4 M.

For the investigated flavones, the rate-limiting
step (in the second range) likely leads to the formation of a kinetic
intermediate flavone·FeNTA* that rapidly rearranges
in a subsequent step to the final thermodynamic ternary complex flavone·FeNTA. 9  For FFCF3, the rearrangement step was
found to be much slower and resulted in a second first-order step
that can be monitored. In that latter case, 2′-fluorine substitution
likely induces steric interactions and subsequently large dihedral
angle deformation between the B and C rings. The pseudo-first-order
rate constants kobs1 of the first step
vary linearly with [flavone]0 with a significant ordinate
at the origin (k–1, monomolecular
dissociation rate constant, Table 8, Figures 11 and S69–S71).

The linear least-square fits of kobs versus [flavone]0 led also to
the determination of the bimolecular formation rate constant k1 related to the formation of the ternary intermediate
complexes (Table 8).

The k1/k–1 ratio (Table 6) accounts
for the stability of the intermediate ferric complexes. For ladanein FOMe, the log(k1/k–1) = 4.0 was found to be close to the conditional
stability constant measured at pH 7.4 by UV–vis absorption
spectrophotometry (log K*FOMe·FeNTA = 4.7(4)), thus suggesting that the
intermediate complex closely resembles the thermodynamic one. For
apigenin and FCF3, the ratio k1/k–1 is
1–2 orders of magnitude lower than the stability constants
measured at pH 7.4 (Table 6), suggesting that the observed rate-limiting step likely
leads to a kinetic intermediate that rearranges rapidly to the thermodynamic
complex. Evidence of this mechanism came with FFCF3 for which two rate-limiting steps were observed.
If the first rate-limiting step is not significantly dependent on
the nature of the flavone, A or B substitution can markedly influence
the rearrangement step. Throughout this study, we have assumed a single
Fe(III) NTA species that, in fact, corresponds to a mixture
of two predominant hydroxylated species, namely, the mono-hydroxo
[FeNTA(OH)]− and bis-hydroxo [FeNTA(OH)2]2– species. Only the
[FeNTA(OH)]− species has been shown
to be reactive.51 Therefore, the k1 value reflects the reactivity of the flavones
with [FeNTA(OH)]−. Table 7 shows the main results obtained
for our flavones together with literature data that allowed us to
draw important conclusions. The difference observed for FOMe and its fluorinated analogues can be explained by the different
experimental conditions (CH3OH/H2O vs H2O). The reactivity of [FeNTA(OH)]− is seemingly independent of the nature of the binding ligand. This
suggests that [FeNTA(OH)]− is associated
to a dissociative interchange mechanism of the Eigen–Wilkins
type in the same way as Fe(OH)2+. [FeNTA(OH)]− was found to be 4–10 times more reactive than
Fe(OH)2+, thus accounting for a strong labilizing effect
of the water molecules by the trianionic tetradentate NTA in the first coordination shell of Fe(III). An increased number
of negative charges around the ferric center will indeed strongly
destabilize the remaining bound water molecules.

Fe(III) Coordination
and pH Dependency as Key Parameters for Ladanein Bioactivation and
Inhibition of HCV Entry
From the acido-basic properties,
we have seen that, regardless of the flavone considered, the neutral
species predominates over a broad pH range from 5 to 7.4, which is
a relevant condition measured in the liver60 or for efficient HCV internalization. This would a priori indicate
that the deprotonated species of the compound FOMe examined
in this report is seemingly not the relevant species to explain the
antiviral activities reported. However, we showed that the anti-HCV
activity of ladanein is strongly dependent on the pH (Figure 12A) at which it has been preincubated.
This would suggest that high pH, among other factors (vide infra),
favors bioactivation of ladanein. In addition to their acido-basic
properties, the Fe(III) complexation of ladanein has then to be taken
into consideration. The influence of a powerful Fe(III) chelator,
ferrioxamine B (DFO), was examined. The antiviral activity of ladanein
was found to be entirely abolished following the addition of an equimolar
amount of the exogenous Fe(III) chelator (Figure 12B). This confirms that the antiviral activity
of ladanein is Fe(III) and pH dependent. By mechanisms that have been
not yet been identified, the flavone likely alters the physicochemical
properties of the viral particles and inhibits their infectivity.

virus. Then, Lunet CD81 high cells were inoculated with the compound/virus

saline, and lysed 72 h after infection. Control infections where virus
particles were treated with the given pH buffers without addition
of compound were conducted in parallel. The HCV infection efficiency
was determined by luciferase expression and is expressed relative
to the infection experiments in absence of inhibitor at the respective
pH. Mean values of one to three experiments are shown. The blue bars

activity was analyzed using a plate luminometer. Percent infection

Inhibition
of HCV entry was evaluated by inoculation of the highly permissive

virus (JcR-2a).61 Therefore, the virus
was preincubated with the compounds for 60 min at 37 °C prior
to inoculation of cells (Figure 13). Synthetic ladanein and the four analogues specifically
inhibited HCV cell entry with an inhibitory concentration of 50% in
the low micromolar range (Figure 14).

Conclusions
The physicochemical properties of ladanein FOMe and its analogues were thoroughly investigated in this
study, and the resulting data were discussed with respect to other
relevant biomolecules. This work was aimed at better understanding
the reactivity and the MoA of this class of promising virucidal compounds.
Flavones might indeed be bioactivated by Fe(III)/pH to lead to C,C-
and/or C,O-coupling products and particular attention to the effect
of these two parameters on the virucidal activity was paid in this
work. Last but not the least, scarce physicochemical data have been
reported with respect to the metal complexation properties of these
uncommon 5,6-hydroxylated flavones.

The pKa values were attributed to the 6-OH unit. The substitution
pattern on the B ring does not exert a significant role on the protonation
properties of the A ring. Therefore, the substituent pattern of the
B ring is seemingly not essential for fine-tuning the acido-basic
properties of the flavone. It rather modulates the properties of the
B (4-carbonyl unit) and C rings, making it possible to bring structural
diversity in the B cycle.

The electrochemical behavior of these
flavones was then described. Within the −0.8/1.2 V potential
range, the flavones undergo a 2e– irreversible oxidation
and reduction mechanism that is limited by diffusion. This electrochemical
behavior likely corresponds to an ECE process centered on the 5-OH
and 6-OH groups borne by A cycle. From −2.35 to −1.5
V, a 1e– (quasi)reversible process was evidenced
and attributed to a redox process centered on the enone moiety of
C cycle. In that case, substitution in B cycle exerted a marked influence
on the redox properties. When examined within the full potential range
(i.e., −2.35/1.2 V), side reactions (e.g., dismutation, coupling,
etc.) likely occurred and led to new and still unidentified species
that are characterized by the appearance of new peaks.

Ladanein FOMe and its analogues were also demonstrated to lead to the
formation of ferric monochelates. Particular attention was herein
paid to the Fe(III) complexation properties of ladanein and its analogues
under physiological conditions. To avoid insoluble ferric species, NTA was used as an exogenous ligand. At pH 7.4, it was found
that ternary flavone·FeNTA complexes are formed.
The stoichiometry of the complexes was further confirmed by ESI-MS.
Last but not the least, involvement of the exogenous NTA ligand in the flavone–Fe(III) complexes prevented the flavone
oxidation/degradation, likely due to alteration of the redox properties
of the metallic center.

In the last approach, the Fe(III) uptake
kinetics was investigated using stopped-flow spectrophotometry. Under
acidic conditions, a first-order kinetics with respect to ladanein
was observed. Over a much longer time span, ladanein oxidation triggered
by Fe(III) complexation was observed in the form of a slow biphasic
kinetic process that was not further investigated herein. The ferric
flavone complexes are formed through two reaction routes involving
either Fe3+ or Fe(OH)2+. At pH 7.4, the complexation
kinetics of FeNTA by ladanein and some of its analogues
was rationalized by the formation of a first kinetic intermediate
that rapidly rearranges to the final ferric complex. With respect
to the first rate-limiting step, comparable bimolecular rate constants
were measured as a result of a process being controlled by the reactivity
of [FeNTA(OH)]2–. The second step was
proposed to strongly depend on the nature of the bound flavone.

With respect to the antiviral activity, substitution by fluorinated
groups allowed improving significantly the anti-infectious activity
of the ladanein flavone. Combining a strong iron chelator such as
DFO led to the abolishment of the ladanein antiviral activity. Indeed,
preincubation for 15 min of the HCV reporter virus (FF-Luc-Jc1) with
DFO prior to addition of ladanein and infection of Huh-7.5 human hepatoma
cells led to full abolishment of the antiviral activity upon addition
of an equimolar amount of the exogenous chelator with respect to ladanein.
This clearly indicates that iron complexation by ladanein and its
analogues is an essential prerequisite to their antiviral properties
and further substantiates the nature and stoichiometry of the ferric
complexes assessed under quasiphysiological conditions. On the other
hand, a clear impact of the pH was demonstrated on the anti-HCV activity
of ladanein above pH 6–7. Control experiments conducted in
parallel with virus particles and aqueous buffers from pH 3 to 10.4
in the absence of the flavone confirm the specific HCV entry inhibition
effect of ladanein above pH 6.

Altogether, these physicochemical
parameters allowed getting a deeper insight into the reactivity and
iron(III) coordination properties of ladanein and several bioactive
analogues. Cross-analysis of the physicochemical and biological data
allowed demonstrating that iron coordination by the flavone is a key
step of the bioactivation responsible for the anti-HCV activity observed
for ladanein. The preparation of a homogenous series of compounds
highlighted the key structural features that are essential for the
antiviral properties of these flavones. This extensive study paves
the way for further development and improvement of this promising
class of antiviral drug candidates.

Experimental Methods
Chemical
Synthesis
Starting materials were purchased from ABCR, GmbH
& Co. KG, Sigma-Aldrich, Alfa Aesar, and Apollo Scientific and
used as received. Solvents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and Carlo
Erba. Reagent grade solvents were used for reactions and column chromatography,
and analytical grade solvents were used for recrystallization. Dichloromethane
(DCM) was distilled over CaH2 under argon (Ar). Tetrahydrofuran
(THF) was dried by using an activated alumina column under Ar. 1H NMR spectra were recorded on Bruker AC 300 (300 MHz) with
solvent peaks as reference. Chemical shifts (δ) are reported
in parts per million. Multiplicities are given as: singlet (s), doublet
(d), triplet (t), quartet (q), doublet of doublets (dd), multiplet
(m), and broad singlet (br s). 13C NMR spectra were recorded
on Bruker AC 300 (75 MHz). Infrared (IR) spectra (cm–1) were recorded neatly on a PerkinElmer Spectrum One Spectrophotometer.
ESI high-resolution mass spectra were recorded on a Bruker micrOTOF
spectrometer. Melting points were measured on a Stuart Melting Point
10 apparatus and are given uncorrected. Ladanein FOMe and its precursor FPOMe were synthesized according
to reported procedures6 (Scheme S1). Because many drawbacks were raised in the former
synthesis (route A, Scheme S1), a more
efficient, robust, and multigram synthesis (route B, Scheme S1) was developed to prepare ladanein and other analogues
(Scheme S1). The synthesis of new ladanein
precursors and analogues followed the same procedures (Scheme S1) and are described below. Routes A
and B differed from the commercial starting materials, i.e., 4,6-dimethoxy-2-hydroxy
acetophenone in route A and 2,6-dimethoxy-1,4-benzoquinone in route
B. Both starting materials were used to produce the same acetophenone
intermediate 2 but with different yields (35 vs 70% (+30% as its acetyl
analogue 3) yield in routes A and B, respectively).

General Procedure
for the Synthesis of the Final Precursors 4a–f (Scheme S1)
A solution of LiHMDS was
prepared by adding n-BuLi (1.6 M in hexane, 7.5 equiv)
to a solution of freshly distilled HMDS (7.9 equiv) in dry THF at
0 °C and stirred for 30 min. It was then added drop wise to a
mixture of starting acetophenones 2 and 36 (or separated and purified 2 or 3) in dry THF under Ar at −78 °C. The mixture was stirred
for 1 h at −78 °C, 2 h at −10 °C, and cooled
down again to −78 °C. A solution of the benzoyl chloride
(2 equiv) prepared in dry THF was added, and the reaction was stirred
for 1 h at −78 °C and then at RT overnight. The solution
was then poured into a mixture of crushed ice and concentrated HCl,
extracted three times with DCM, and dried over MgSO4. The
solvent was removed under reduced pressure to yield a brown solid
that was used without further purification. The crude product was
then dissolved in acetic acid, and H2SO4 was
added. The mixture was then stirred at 95 °C for 3.5–6
h. The solvent was evaporated under reduced pressure, water was added,
and the aqueous phase was extracted three times with DCM. The organic
phase was dried over MgSO4, and the solvent was evaporated
under reduced pressure to yield a dark brown solid. The crude product
was dissolved in THF, and MeOH solution of LiOH in excess was added.
The reaction mixture was stirred at RT for 2 h. The solution was then
poured into water, and acetic acid was used to fix the pH at about
5. The aqueous phase was extracted three times with DCM, and the organic
phase was thoroughly washed with NaOH solution (0.5 M). The aqueous
phase was then acidified to neutral pH with HCl solution (1 M), and
the aqueous phase was extracted three times with DCM. The solvent
was evaporated under reduced pressure and the solid was recrystallized
from water/EtOAc to lead to the pure targeted final precursor. The
final precursors 4a–f have been fully
characterized (see the Supporting Information).

General Procedure for the Synthesis of Deprotected Flavones
Route A: A solution of the starting material (0.15 mmol, 1.0 equiv)
in dry CH2Cl2 (5.0 mL) was stirred for 30 min
at 0 °C. The BBr3 solution (0.75 mL 1 M solution in
CH2Cl2, 0.75 mmol, 5.0 equiv) was added drop
wise at 0 °C, and the mixture was stirred for another 30 min.
The MeOH (2.0 mL) was introduced for quenching the reaction, and saturated
NaCl (10.0 mL) was added. The water layer was extracted with dichloromethane
(3 × 50.0 mL) and diethyl ether (2 × 50.0 mL), and the combined
organic layers were dried (MgSO4) and evaporated. The residue
was purified by chromatography on Sephadex LH-20 (eluent: MeOH/CH2Cl2 1:1) and recrystallized.

Route B: To
a solution of the final precursor (1 equiv) in CH3CN was
added MgBr2 (3 equiv). The reaction mixture was stirred
for 3 h at 80 °C and monitored by thin-layer chromatography using
DCM/EtOAc 1:1 as eluent. After consumption of all starting material,
HCl solution (0.5 M) was added and the aqueous phase was extracted
three times with EtOAc. The organic phase was then washed three times
with HCl solution (0.5 M) and one time with water and brine. The organic
layer was dried over MgSO4, concentrated under reduced
pressure, and recrystallized from DCM to yield the targeted product.
The deprotected flavones FOMe, FH, FF, FCF3, FFCF3, and FOCF3 have been fully characterized (see the Supporting Information).

Physicochemical Investigations
Solvents and Materials
Distilled water was purified by passing it through a bed of activated
carbon (Bioblock Scientific ORC-83005) and ion exchanger (Bioblock
Scientific R3-83002, M3-83006). Methanol (Merck, p.a.) of spectrophotometric
grade and water were deoxygenated by CO2- and O2-free Ar (Sigma Oxiclear cartridge). The electrochemical experiments
were conducted in spectroscopic grade DMSO (BioReagent for molecular
biology, >99.9%, Sigma) at room temperature (25 ± 1 °C)
containing 0.1 M of n-Bu4PF6 as the inert supporting electrolyte.65 The stock solutions were prepared by weighting solid products (Mettler
Toledo XA105 Dual Range (0.01/0.1 mg to 41/120 g)). Dissolution of
the ligands was achieved by using an ultrasonic bath (Bandelin Sonorex
RK102). For the determination of the acido-basic properties, the ionic
strength was maintained at 0.1 M with n-tetrabutylammonium
perchlorate (NEt4ClO4, Fluka, puriss) and the
measurements were carried out at 25.0(2) °C.

CAUTION! Perchlorate
salts combined with organic ligands are potentially explosive and
must be handled with great care.66

Fe(III) perchlorate stock solutions (Fluka) were prepared in water
under acidic conditions (pH < 1.5) immediately before use, and
their concentrations were determined by using UV–vis absorption
(ε240 = 4.16 × 103 M–1 cm–1 and ε260 = 2.88 × 103 M–1 cm–1).67

The FeNTA solutions were
prepared freshly by adding an iron(III) aqueous solution (1 equiv)
to 1 equiv of solid NTA (C6H9NO6, Fluka, purum). Few drops of HClO4 (70%) were
added. The pH of the mixture was then raised to 7.4 with a HEPES buffer
(0.1 M). A slight excess of NTA with respect to iron(III)
was always used to ensure complete complexation of iron(III) and avoid
free ferric species.

Spectrophotometric Titrations of the Flavones
vs pH
First, stock solutions of the flavones were prepared
by quantitative dissolution of the corresponding solid samples in
methanol. For solubility reasons, the flavones were then diluted in
CH3OH/H2O solvent (80/20 w/w) containing the
supporting electrolyte (0.1 M NEt4ClO4, Fluka,
puriss). Forty millimeters of the solution were then introduced into
a jacketed cell (Metrohm) maintained at 25.0(2) °C (Lauda E200
thermostat) under Ar atmosphere. The free hydrogen-ion concentration
was measured with a combined glass electrode (Metrohm 6.0234.500,
Long Life; Ag/AgCl reference; NaCl 0.1 M (Fluka, p.a.)) and an automatic
titrator system 794 Basic Titrino (Metrohm; Tiamo light 1.2 program
for the acquisition of the potentiometric data). The glass electrode
was calibrated by titrating known amounts of HClO4 (∼7
× 10–2 M from HClO4, Prolabo, normapur,
70% min) with CO2-free NEt4OH solution (∼7
× 10–2 M from NEt4OH ∼40%
in water; Aldrich, purum) in CH3OH/H2O solvent.68 The HClO4 and NEt4OH solutions
were prepared just before use and titrated with sodium tetraborate
(B4Na2O7·10H2O, Fluka,
puriss, p.a.) and potassium hydrogen phthalate (C8H5KO3, Fluka, puriss, p.a.), respectively, using
methyl orange (RAL) and phenolphthalein (Prolabo, purum) indicators.
The flavone solution was acidified, and the absorption titration (2
< pH < 12) was then carried out by addition of known volumes
of the base. Special care was taken to ensure that complete equilibration
was attained. Absorption spectra were recorded with a Varian Cary
50 spectrophotometer fitted with Hellma optical fibers (Hellma, 041.002-UV)
and an immersion probe (l = 1 cm) made of quartz
suprazil (Hellma, 661.500-QX).

Spectrophotometric Titrations
of Ladanein and Its Analogues with Fe(III) at pH 2.0
Stock
solutions of the flavones were prepared in CH3OH/H2O (80/20 w/w) containing a supporting electrolyte (0.1 M NEt4ClO4, Fluka, puriss) and then freshly diluted with
HClO4 (10–2 M) to lead to a final concentration
of ∼5.92 × 10–5 and ∼4–7
× 10–5 M for FOMe and the other
flavones, respectively. Microvolumes of a concentrated Fe(III) solution
that were prepared just before use were added to an aliquot of 0.5
mL (or 2.5 mL) of the flavone solution in a quartz optical cell (Hellma, l = 1 cm). The [Fe(III)]0/[flavone]0 ratio was varied from 0 to ∼1.2–1.6, and after each
addition, precautions have been taken to ensure that the complete
equilibration was achieved. The UV–vis spectra were then recorded
from 230 to 800 nm on a Cary 50 (Varian) or 300 (Varian) spectrophotometer
maintained at 25.0(2) °C (Lauda E200 thermostat).

Spectrophotometric
Titrations of Ladanein and Its Analogues with Fe(III) at pH 7.4 in
the Presence of an Exogenous NTA Ligand
NTA was
used to characterize and quantify the corresponding ladanein ferric
complexes at physiological pH.53–56 A stock solution of ladanein (5.41
× 10–5 M) was prepared in HEPES buffer at pH
7.4 (0.1 M in CH3OH/H2O, 80/20 w/w). The ionic
strength was adjusted to 0.1 M with NEt4ClO4 (Fluka, puriss). Microvolumes of a concentrated FeNTA solution (2.41 × 10–3 M) were added to an
aliquot of 2 mL of the flavone solution disposed in a quartz optical
cell (Hellma, l = 1 cm). Along the absorption, the
[FeNTA]0/[ladanein]0 ratio was
varied from 0 to 2.0. After each addition, the solution was mixed
and care was taken to ensure complete equilibration. The UV–vis
spectra were recorded on a Cary 300 (Varian) spectrophotometer maintained
at 25.0(2) °C (Lauda E200 thermostat).

Analysis and Processing
of the Spectroscopic Data
The spectrophotometric data were
analyzed with Specfit69 program that adjusts
the absorptivities and the stability constants of the species formed
at equilibrium. Specfit uses factor analysis to reduce the absorbance
matrix and to extract the eigenvalues prior to the multiwavelength
fit of the reduced data set according to the Marquardt algorithm.70,71

Electrochemistry
The redox properties of ladanein and its
analogues were investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) in DMSO solvent
containing 0.1 M n-Bu4PF6.
DMSO was found to be a suitable solvent72−74 to characterize the
electrochemical properties of our flavones (i.e., potential limits
from +0.9 to −3.9 V versus Fc/Fc+, E = +0.524 V/Ag/AgCl73). CVs of ladanein FOMe and its analogues (∼mM) were recorded with a VoltaLab
50 potentiostat/galvanostat equipment (Radiometer Analytical; MDE15
polarographic stand; PST050 analytical voltammetry; CTV101 speed control
unit) controlled by the VoltaMaster 4 electrochemical software. A
conventional three-electrode cell (10 mL) fitted with a glassy carbon
(GC) disk (s = 0.07 cm2) set into a Teflon
rotating tube was used as the working electrode, a Pt wire was used
as a counterelectrode, and a KCl(3 M)/Ag/AgCl reference electrode
(+210 mV vs normal hydrogen electrode) was employed.75 Prior to any measurement, the GC electrode surface was
carefully polished with an aluminum oxide suspension (0.3 μm,
Escil) disposed on a silicon carbide abrasive sheet (grit 800/2400).
The flavone solution (ca. mM) was vigorously stirred in the electrochemical
cell and purged with O2-free (Sigma Oxiclear cartridge)
Ar for 15 min before the voltammetry experiment was initiated. An
Ar atmosphere was maintained during the measurement procedure. The
voltage sweep rate was varied from 50 mV s–1 to
6 V s–1. Oxidation and reduction peak potentials
were measured at a scan rate of 200 mV s–1 unless
otherwise stated.

Kinetic Measurements
The formation
kinetics was studied at 25.0(2) °C with a SX-18MV stopped-flow
spectrophotometer (Applied Photophysics).

The formation kinetics
of the ladanein ferric complexes was first studied under acidic conditions
(5.88 × 10–3 M ≤ [H+] ≤
9.4 × 10–2 M) in excess of Fe(III) (5.54 ×
10–3 M < [Fe(III)] < 5.54 × 10–4 M). At least 10 times more concentrated solution of Fe(III) with
respect to ladanein was used to impose pseudo-first-order conditions.
Ladanein concentration was fixed at ∼3–5 × 10–5 M. The reaction was monitored at 650 nm (maximum
of the LMCT absorption band).

The uptake kinetics of Fe(III)
by ladanein FOMe, FCF3, FFCF3, or apigenin was
also investigated at pH 7.4 (0.1 M HEPES buffer) in the presence of NTA used as an auxiliary iron(III) chelator. The experiments
were performed in excess of the flavones with a ratio [Fe(III)]/[NTA] ∼ 1 ([FeNTA]0 = 2.3 ×
10–5 M). At least 10 times more concentrated solutions
of the flavones with respect to Fe(NTA) were used to
impose pseudo-first-order conditions. The uptake kinetics was recorded
at the maximum of the LMCT absorption band (Table 6).

Analysis and Processing of the Kinetic Data
The data sets, averaged out of at least three replicates, were
analyzed with the commercial software Biokine.76 This program fits up to three exponential functions to
the experimental curves with the Simplex algorithm77 after initialization with a Padé–Laplace
method.78
