A series
of (Bi1–xYx)VO4 (0.4 ≤ x ≤
1.0) ceramics were synthesized using the traditional solid-state reaction
method. In the composition range of 0.4 ≤ x ≤ 1.0, a zircon-type solid solution was formed between 900
and 1550 °C. Combined with our previous work (scheelite monoclinic
and zircon-type phases coexist in the range of x <
0.40), a pseudobinary phase diagram of BiVO4–YVO4 is presented. As x decreased from 1.0 to
0.40, the microwave permittivity (εr) of (Bi1–xYx)VO4 ceramics increased linearly from 11.03 to 30.9, coincident
with an increase in the temperature coefficient of resonant frequency
(TCF) from −61.3 to +103 ppm/°C. Excellent microwave dielectric
properties were obtained for (Bi0.3Y0.7)VO4 sintered at 1025 °C and (Bi0.2Y0.8)VO4 sintered at 1075 °C with εr ∼ 19.35, microwave quality factor (Qf) ∼ 25 760
GHz, and TCF ∼ +17.8 ppm/°C and εr ∼
16.3, Qf ∼ 31 100 GHz, and TCF ∼ −11.9
ppm/°C, respectively. Raman spectra, Shannon’s additive
rule, a classical oscillator model, and far-infrared spectra were
employed to study the structure–property relations in detail.
All evidence supported the premise that Bi-based vibrations dominate
the dielectric permittivity in the microwave region.

Introduction
Microwave dielectric ceramics have played
an important role in
modern wireless communication systems such as dielectric resonators,
filters, capacitors, and duplexers. To meet the requirement of miniaturization
and reliability of microwave devices, large dielectric permittivity
(εr), large microwave quality factor (Qf), and near-zero
temperature coefficient of resonant frequency (TCF) must be achieved.1−4

Many classic microwave dielectric ceramics based on ABO3 perovskite structure have been explored, and the structure–property
relation has been extensively studied.5,6 Recently, many
complex oxides with a classic ABO4-type structure, such
as scheelite (CaMoO4, BiVO4),7,8 Fergusonite
(LaNbO4, NdNbO4),9 stibiotantalite (BiNbO4, BiTaO4),10,11 wolframite (ZnWO4, MgWO4),12 zircon (CeVO4),13 and rutile ((Zn,Nb)TiO4, (Cu,Nb)TiO4)14,15 structures, have been reported to have good microwave dielectric
properties. Zircon-type (I41/amd) vanadates (AVO4, A = Sc3+, Ln3+, Bi3+) are a subset of ABO4-type compounds
and were widely investigated due to their potential optical, magnetic,
elastic, and electric properties.4,13 The zircon
structure is composed of alternating [VO4] tetrahedra and
edge-sharing [AO8] dodecahedra, forming chains parallel
to the c axis. Two [AO8] dodecahedra are
arranged along the a, b, and c axes, which results in a linear increase in cell volumes
with A-site ionic radius.4,16 As reported by Watanabe
and Zuo,13,17 LaVO4 prefers to crystallize
in a monoclinic monazite-type structure with a space group P21/n. The microwave dielectric
properties of zircon-type CeVO4 ceramics were first reported
by Wang et al.13 with a εr ∼ 12.3, Qf ∼ 41 460 GHz, and TCF ∼ −34.4
at a sintering temperature of ∼950 °C. It can be deduced
that other rare-earth orthovanadates, such as YVO4, SmVO4, and NdVO4, may also possess similar microwave
dielectric properties. However, their large negative TCF values must
be modified to near zero. There are two traditional methods to modify
the TCF value of microwave dielectric ceramics to near zero, which
are broadly separated into a composite and a solid-solution approach.18 In our previous work, a temperature-stable microwave
dielectric composite ceramic, which contains both scheelite BiVO4 and zircon-type (Bi0.6Y0.4)VO4 phases with a εr = 45, Qf ∼ 14 000
GHz, and TCF = +10 ppm/°C, was achieved.4 The end member, (Bi0.6Y0.4)VO4,
takes on the zircon structure with a positive TCF (+32 ppm/°C).
This result inspired the design of a zircon-type solid-solution ceramic
in the (Bi,Y)VO4 system with a near-zero TCF. Undoped BiVO4 ceramic prepared via the solid-state reaction method crystallizes
in a monoclinic scheelite structure, not a zircon structure. As reported
by Watanabe,17 the solid solubility of
the Bi3+ ion in zircon-structured (BixCe1–x)VO4 ceramics
is ≥60%, as confirmed in our previous work,19 which is attributed to the presence of the zircon-type
BiVO4 synthesized by a precipitation method.20,21 Undoped zircon-type BiVO4 is not stable and irreversibly
transforms into a monoclinic scheelite structure at >300 °C,21 and it is plausible that the substitution of
Bi for Y in YVO4 stabilizes the zircon-type lattice. In
the present work, a comprehensive study on the phase assemblage and
evolution in the (Bi,Y)VO4 system was performed on the
zircon-type solid-solution region and its associated sintering behavior,
microstructure, and microwave dielectric properties were studied in
detail.

Results and Discussion
The X-ray diffraction (XRD)
patterns of the (Bi1–xYx)VO4 ceramics
calcined and sintered at their optimal temperatures are presented
in Figure 1a. All peaks
were indexed as a zircon-type phase for x ≥
0.4. As Bi concentration increased (decrease of x), all diffraction peaks shifted to the lower 2θ, commensurate
with an increase in the cell volume, which is attributed to the larger
ionic radius of Bi3+ (1.17 Å) compared with that of
Y3+ (1.019 Å). The cell parameters of (Bi1–xYx)VO4 (x ≥ 0.4) ceramics as a function of x value are presented in Figure 1b. a and c parameters
increased from 7.116 to 7.225 Å and 6.287 to 7.394 Å, respectively,
as x decreased from 1.0 to 0.4, commensurate with
an increase in the cell volume from 318.35 to 333.79 Å3. As shown in Figure 1c, the refined values of lattice parameters for the (Bi0.3Y0.7)VO4 sample are a = b = 7.163(7) Å and c = 6.336(2) Å
with a space group I41/amd (141). All of the atomic fractional coordinates are listed in Table 1. The goodness of
fit of refinement, which is defined as the ratio of Rwp to Rexp, is ∼3.15.
The V–O distance in the zircon-type (Bi0.3Y0.7)VO4 sample is 1.7005 Å, similar to that
in YVO4 (1.7058 Å). The long and short (Bi,Y)–O
bond distances are 2.3301 and 2.4520 Å, respectively, which are
larger than those in YVO4 (2.2986 and 2.4434 Å, respectively),22 consistent with the larger ionic radius of Bi3+ than that of Y3+. Combined with our previous
work,4 the schematic phase diagram of the
(1 – x)BiVO4–xYVO4 binary system is presented in Figure 1d. In the region x ≥
0.4, a zircon-type solid-solution phase field was formed. In the region x < 0.4, both monoclinic BiVO4 and zircon
(Bi0.6Y0.4)VO4 coexisted with stable
cell parameters.

Undoped YVO4 belongs
to the D4h19 crystal structure (I41/amd), and the theoretical group analysis
gives an irreducible representation
of the vibrational modes after Miller et al.23 and Vali24 1  The 2A1g, B1g, B2g, and 5Eg modes are the Raman-active
optical modes,
whereas the 3A2u and 4Eu modes are infrared-active.
In addition, there are two further inactive translational modes A2u + Eu. As seen from Figure 2a, the main Raman modes created by stretching
and bending of [VO4] tetrahedra at ∼890, 378, 815,
and 488 cm–1 are assigned to A1g(ν1), A1g(ν2), B2g(ν3), and B2g(ν4), respectively.
The weak mode at 837 cm–1, which is close to the
B2g(ν3) mode, is assigned to Eg. The peaks at 260 cm–1 and overlapping at about
160 cm–1 are external modes caused by translation.
As seen from Figure 2b, the main Raman modes shift to the lower wavenumber as x decreases, along with broadening and a decrease in peak
intensity, due to the A-site disorder in the solid solution. According
to Hardcastle and Wachs’ study on the relation (ν = 21349 e(−1.9176×R),25 in which ν is the Raman shift and R is the bond length of V–O) between the Raman shift and the
V–O bond length, the decrease in the A1g(ν1) Raman mode (stretching mode of [VO4], Figure 2b) is caused by the
increase in the V–O bond length.

0.4) ceramics (a) and as a function of the x value
(b).

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM)
images of the (Bi1–xYx)VO4 ceramics
are shown in Figure 3. For pure YVO4 (x = 1.0), the densification
temperature is above 1550 °C, and many pores are observed in
ceramics sintered at 1550 °C for 2 h. As seen from Figure 3a–c, substitution of
Bi for Y effectively lowered the sintering temperature and induced
a homogeneous dense microstructure in (Bi1–xYx)VO4 ceramics with x = 0.7, 0.8, and 0.9. As x decreased from
1.0 to 0.7, the sintering temperatures of (Bi1–xYx)VO4 ceramics
lowered from 1550 to 1025 °C along with a decrease in the grain
size from ∼5 to ∼1 μm.

Figure 3 SEM images of (Bi1–xYx)VO4 ceramics sintered at different
temperatures: x = 0.70 at 1025 °C (a), 0.80
at 1075 °C (b), 0.90 at 1225 °C (c), and 1.00 at 1550 °C
(d).

The microwave εr and Qf of the (Bi1–xYx)VO4 ceramics
as a function of sintering temperature are shown in Figure 4. The εr of
(Bi1–xYx)VO4 ceramics increased with sintering temperature due
to the elimination of pores before reaching a stable value. The Qf
increased with sintering temperature, reaching a maximum value before
decreasing sharply for all samples except for x =
1.0. The Qf is composed of intrinsic and extrinsic contributions and
affected by grain size, grain boundaries, and pores. For (Bi1–xYx)VO4 ceramics,
high Qf values were attained only in a relatively narrow sintering
temperature range. Optimal microwave properties of (Bi1–xYx)VO4 ceramics
are listed in Table 2, in which εr decreases linearly from 30.9 at x = 0.4 to 11.1 at x = 1.0 in accordance
with Shannon’s additive rule. Shannon26 suggested that polarizabilities of oxides may be estimated by summing
the polarizabilities of constituent ions. The polarizabilities, αx, of (Bi1–xYx)VO4 may be calculated as
follows 2  where αBi3+, αY3+, αV5+, and αO2– are the polarizabilities of Bi3+, Y3+, V5+, and O2–, respectively.
Because of smaller polarizabilities of Y3+ relative to
those of Bi3+ (αBi3+ = 6.123 Å > αY3+ = 3.81 Å3),26 there should be a linear decrease
in (Bi1–xYx)VO4 as x increases. Using the Clausius–Mossotti
relation, which relates εx, αx, and molar cell volume Vx, εr may be calculated 3  The
values of molecular αx calculated
from eqs 2 and 3 along with the macroscopic microwave dielectric
properties are listed in Table 2. As x decreases, the relative deviation
between αcal. and αmeas. increases.
Employing eq 3, it can
be obtained that αBi3+ – αY3+ = (αx2 –
αx1)/(x1 – x2) ≈ 5.8 Å3. This result is greater than that reported by Shannon (2.31
Å3), which suggests that within its coordination in
the zircon-type structure, Bi3+ contributes much more than
Y3+ to the dielectric polarizability, compared with that
in higher-symmetry systems.

The
highest Qf (∼40 700 GHz) was obtained for (Bi0.1Y0.9)VO4, but as x decreased
to 0.65 and 0.40, the Qf decreased linearly to 16 000
GHz. The intrinsic dielectric loss determines the upper limit of Qf
and is quantitatively described by the classical one-phonon damped
oscillator model as follows27 4  where ε*(ω)
is the complex permittivity,
ε(∞) is the electronic part of the static permittivity,
εT is the transverse frequency of the polar phonon
mode, γ is the damping parameter, z is the
equivalent electric charge number, e is the electric
charge of an electron, m is the equivalent atom weight,
and V is the unit volume. In the microwave region,
considering ω2 ≪ ωT2, the relationship between the
Qf and εr is obtained as follows 5  The above relation was successfully used to
explain the reciprocal relationship between the εr and Qf in scheelite solid solutions.28 The same qualitative relationship holds for zircon-type solid solutions
in (Bi1–xYx)VO4 ceramics. The decrease in Qf for undoped YVO4 is attributed to the absence of a sintering temperature,
at which the density of the end member compound may be optimized.
The TCF of undoped YVO4 is ∼−61.3 ppm/°C.
As x decreased to 0.40, the TCF linearly increased
to +103 ppm/°C. In contrast, +17.8 and −11.9 ppm/°C
were obtained in the (Bi0.3Y0.7)VO4 and (Bi0.2Y0.8)VO4 ceramics, respectively,
suggesting that zero TCF may be achieved for 0.7 < x < 0.8. The TCF is usually defined as follows 6  where αl is the thermal expansion
coefficient and τε is the temperature coefficient
of dielectric constant. Usually αl of microwave dielectric
is <+20 ppm/°C and independent
of x. Hence, the TCF value mainly depends on τε. Using the Clausius–Mosotti relation, Bosman
and Havinga29 derived an expression for
τε at constant pressure as follows 7    The sum of the A and B terms is approximately 6 ppm/°C. Term C usually lies between −1 and ∼−10
ppm/°C
and represents the direct dependence of the polarizability on temperature. Figure 5a shows a plot of
the temperature dependence of permittivity (αl was assumed to be +20 ppm/°C) as a function of (ε
– 1)(ε + 2)/ε for all of the (Bi1–xYx)VO4 ceramics
to extrapolate the (A + B + C) value ∼ −16.1 ppm/°C, which is within
the acceptable range. Using this relation, any TCF value can be achieved
by precisely adjusting the composition. Furthermore, it is similar
to the empirical logarithmic rule (ln ε = y1 ln ε1 + y2 ln ε2/TCF = y1 ln τf1 + y2 ln τf2)30 suitable for composites. The temperature dependence of
the εr and Qf of the (Bi0.3Y0.7)VO4 and (Bi0.2Y0.8)VO4 ceramics in the temperature range 25–130 °C is shown
in Figure 5b. εr is stable at ∼19 and 16 for the (Bi0.3Y0.7)VO4 and (Bi0.2Y0.8)VO4 ceramics, respectively. Qf decreased linearly with temperature
from 28 000 to ∼20 000 GHz, confirming that the
dielectric loss increased with temperature. Taking into account the
above arguments, temperature-stable microwave dielectric ceramics
may be obtained for 0.7 < x < 0.8 with 16 ≤
εr ≤ 19 and Qf > 20 000 GHz between
25 and 130 °C. The sintering temperature of this system (below
1050 °C) is much lower than that of SrLnAlO4 (Ln =
Nd and Sm) microwave dielectric ceramics31 (1475–1500 °C) with similar properties (permittivity
17.8–18.8, Qf values 25 700–54 880 GHz,
and TCF values −9 ∼ +2 ppm/°C), and this can save
a lot of energy during processing.

Far-infrared reflectivity is a useful tool to investigate
intrinsic
dielectric properties of microwave ceramics. As discussed above, there
are seven infrared-active modes including three A2u and
four Eu modes. In Vali et al.’s work,24 a perpendicular electric field of the incident
light to the c axis of YVO4 single crystal
was employed to obtain the infrared reflectivity and only four Eu modes, at 195, 263, 309, and 780 cm–1,
were observed. As shown in Figure 6, besides the four Eu modes, two other modes
at 439 and 916 cm–1, assigned to A2u modes,
were also observed to contribute to the infrared reflectivity spectra
of the YVO4 ceramic sample. The high wavenumber peak at
916 cm–1 belongs to the stretching mode of [VO4], which is similar to that at 977 cm–1 caused
by the Si–O stretching in ZrSiO4 material.31,32 As x decreased 
to 0.8, four new modes are observed, at 69, 136, 233, and 749 cm–1. These new modes are also assigned to Eu modes caused by the partial occupation by Bi on the A site of the
zircon structure. The external Eu modes below 450 cm–1 are conventionally caused by translation and rotation
between A-site ions and [VO4] tetrahedra, as shown in Figure 6b. Because of the
different relative masses of Bi and Y atoms, the translation and rotation
strengths are different and lead to different Raman shifts; consequently,
the strength of the Eu modes increased with Bi concentration.

reflectivity of (Bi1–xYx)VO4 ceramics (a)
and schematic of external Eu modes caused by translation
and rotation (b).

Using eq 4, the relation
between complex reflectivity R(ω) and permittivity
can be obtained as follows 8  The fitting of infrared reflectivity was employed
to study the intrinsic dielectric contribution from each vibrational
mode. Infrared reflectivity spectra of (Bi0.3Y0.7)VO4 were fitted using eight modes as shown in Figure 7a, and the related
parameters are listed in Table 3. Among the eight modes, Nos. 1, 2, 4, and 6 belong to Bi-based
vibrations, and their total contribution to the microwave permittivity
was ∼8, whereas all others were attributed to the Y-based and
[VO4] tetrahedral vibrations (value about ∼7.2).
The optical permittivity is ∼4.41. This result indicates that
Bi-based vibrations mainly contribute to permittivity in the microwave
region, in accordance with the analysis using Shannon’s additive
rule. The measured and fitted real and imaginary parts of permittivity
are plotted in Figure 7b. The measured part corresponded well with the fitted values, confirming
that in the microwave region the dielectric polarization is mainly
caused by phonon absorption in the infrared region.

Conclusions
A zircon-type solid solution is formed in (Bi1–xYx)VO4 (0.4
≤ x ≤ 1.0) ceramics. Substitution of
Bi effectively lowered sintering temperatures from above 1550 °C
for undoped YVO4 to ∼900 °C for (Bi0.6Y0.4)VO4. As x decreased from
1.0 to 0.4, cell parameters increased linearly, along with the increase
of εr from 11.03 to 30.9 accompanied by a shift of
TCF value from −61.3 to +103 ppm/°C. Excellent microwave
dielectric properties with a εr ∼ 19.35, Qf
∼ 25 760 GHz, and TCF ∼ +17.8 ppm/°C were obtained
in (Bi0.3Y0.7)VO4 ceramic sintered
at 1025 °C. For (Bi0.2Y0.8)VO4 ceramic sintered at 1075 °C, εr ∼ 16.3,
Qf ∼ 31 100 GHz, and TCF ∼ −11.9 ppm/°C
were obtained. It is demonstrated that temperature-stable microwave
dielectric ceramics can be obtained for compositions with 0.7 < x < 0.8. Therefore, we conclude, with reference to our
previous work,4 that there are two methods
to design temperature-stable microwave dielectric ceramics in the
(Bi1–xYx)VO4 system for gigahertz frequency applications: (1)
the fabrication of composites of scheelite and zircon phases and (2)
the formation of zircon-structured solid solution with 0.7 < x < 0.8.

Experimental Section
The (Bi1–xYx)VO4 (x = 0.4, 0.65, 0.7, 0.8,
0.9, and 1.0) (abbreviated BYVx) samples were prepared via the solid-state
reaction method as described in our previous work.2,3 Samples
were sintered at temperatures from 850 to 1550 °C for 2 h.

XRD was performed with Cu Kα radiation (Rigaku D/MAX-2400
X-ray diffractometry, Tokyo, Japan) using a powder sample. The diffraction
pattern was collected over 5–65° (2θ) at a step
size of 0.02°. The Rietveld profile refinement method was employed
to analyze the data using the FULLPROF program. As-fired surfaces
were observed by SEM (FEI; Quanta 250 F). Raman spectra were performed
with a Raman spectrometer (inVia; Renishaw, England), excited by an
Ar+ laser (514.5 nm). Infrared reflectivity spectra were
measured using a Bruker IFS 66v FT-IR spectrometer on the infrared
beamline station (U4) at the National Synchrotron Radiation Lab. (NSRL),
China. Microwave dielectric properties were measured using the TE01δ method with a network analyzer (HP 8720 Network Analyzer;
Hewlett-Packard) and a temperature chamber (Delta 9023; Delta Design,
Poway, CA). The temperature coefficient of resonant frequency TCF
(τf) was calculated with the following formula 9  where fT and fT0 are the TE01δ resonant frequencies at temperatures T and T0, respectively.
