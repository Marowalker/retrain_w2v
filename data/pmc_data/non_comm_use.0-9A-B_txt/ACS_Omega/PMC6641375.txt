1 Introduction
A scientific
concept is an idea or model explaining some natural
phenomena, which plays a critical role in the development of a new
subject. During the process of finding evidence, the idea or model
is discussed, reformed, proved and then can guide the further development
of the subject and so is for the concept of aggregation-induced emission
(AIE).

Before the birth of AIE, concentration quenching (CQ)
is a general belief and a well-accepted concept for common organic
luminophores, where the molecule quenches its own fluorescence at
high concentrations.1 Problems arise when
utilizing these luminophores, particular in solid states where the
molecules like forming aggregates. As known from the CQ concept, people
tend to believe that the aggregation formation is bad for luminophore
light emission. Therefore, the concept of aggregation-caused quenching
(ACQ) effect is gradually considered as a general belief.2 Then, various chemical and physical methodologies
have been considered, blocking luminophore aggregation formation and
decreasing the quenching effect when employing them in practical applications.3 However, the luminophores are commonly used as
clusters, where they are treated as molecular assembly or nanoaggregates
in microscopically or solid phase in macroscopically. From the single
species to aggregates, there lays a huge gap conceptually and technologically.

Although the concept of CQ and ACQ is helpful in some areas and
is commonly used to avoid the ACQ effect in molecular design, the
derived methodologies have the intrinsic limitation in solving the
ACQ problem and obtain limited success because they are against the
natural process. The aggregate formation is the intrinsic behavior
of luminophores in solid phase. The ACQ concept has reformed peoples’
idea that the aggregation is harmful for solid-state light emission.
The long standing and established concept is gradually found to restrict
people’s way of thinking and has to be reversed. Actually,
few researchers have found some unique systems behaving “abnormally”
whose emission at the aggregation state is stronger than that in solution.4 However, there is no continuous attention paid
to these scattered findings. One reason is that people bury themselves
in the ACQ concept deeply. The other reason is that the emerged abnormal
phenomena lack reasonable explanations and working mechanisms. Therefore,
a novel concept is highly demanded to reform people’s mind
and guide the research, particularly focusing on the constructive
effect of the aggregation formation.

For the past 17 years,
our group started from occasional interesting findings and has established
the concept of AIE, which provides a new platform for luminophore
research.5 The constructive role of the
aggregation for light emission is first paid continuous attention
and enjoys throughout investigations. In this perspective article,
we will briefly review what we have done in the past 17 years by revisiting
the journey of AIE research and offer some perspectives on the future
direction of the area. In detail, we want to emphasize the role of
AIE that have guided important developments in some specific areas.

On the other hand, inspired by the investigations on light’s
interaction with matter, lots of life-changing innovations have arisen.6 Luminescent materials are the cornerstone behind
the area and attract extensive research efforts to explore new dyes
with high efficiencies and multiple functionalities. For years, scientists
have established quite a lot of concepts in the area based on the
fundamental photophysical understanding, where luminophores are treated
as single species such as existing in dilute solution or vapor.7 AIE changed the field revolutionally.

2 Journey of AIE Research
Highly efficient luminescent materials in solid states are promising
candidates for the development of organic optoelectrical materials
and devices and chemical and biological sensors.8 AIE, a novel photophyscial phenomena coined in 2001 where
the aggregate formation enhances the light emission, has drawn great
attention because it provides a fantastic platform for the development
of these useful luminescent materials. Numerous AIE luminogens (AIEgens)
with tunable color and high quantum yields have been reported and
used in diverse applications from optics and electronics to energy
and bioscience.7,9 This perspective article gives
us the opportunity to revisit our research journey, discusses our
current understanding of the AIE mechanism, debates current challenges,
and looks for the potential breakthroughs in this exciting research
theme. We present our journey in the following five aspects.

2.1 From ACQ to AIE
In the
area of luminophore research, before the birth of AIE, ACQ is a well-known
photophysical phenomenon commonly existing in most polyaromatic hydrocarbons,
as mentioned by Birks in Photophysics of Aromatic Molecules.1 For example, as shown in Figure 1b, fluorescein is a typical
ACQ dye.10 It is soluble in water but insoluble
in common organic solvents. As molecularly dissolved in the good solvent,
its water solution emits the bright green light (Figure 1a) upon UV irradiation. However,
the emission is gradually quenched when the acetone is added, where
the molecules form aggregates. Owing to the aggregate formation, the
π–π coplanar interaction between the fluorescein
molecules generates the excimer species that decay through nonradiative
relaxation pathways (Figure 1b). On the contrary, AIE is an another photophysical phenomenon
associated with luminogen aggregation, whose aggregates favor more
intensive emission. A number of structurally similar systems have
been found to exhibit the AIE effect.11 A typical AIEgen is shown in Figure 1d.12 Hexaphenylsilole (HPS)
is nonemissive when it is molecularly dissolved in tetrahydrofuran
(THF) but becomes highly emissive when forming aggregates (Figure 1c). HPS molecules
have the twisted propeller-shaped structures (Figure 1d), which do not allow the π–π
stacking.

Figure 1 Fluorescent digital photographs
of (a) fluorescein and (c) HPS solutions with different bad solvent
fractions. (b) Fluorescein molecules are disk-shaped and become nonemissive
when forming aggregates where strong π–π interaction
quenches the emission. (d) HPS molecules are propeller-shaped and
turn to highly emissive when forming aggregates where the intramolecular
rotation is restricted.

Therefore, luminogen aggregate formation can play
two different roles in the luminescence emission, ACQ and AIE. People
applied a number of approaches against the ACQ effect when used them
in the aggregation state; however, the aggregation cannot be totally
blocked, because it is a natural process. In sharp contrast, the AIE
effect makes it possible to utilize the aggregation process actively,
rather than working against it passively.13 Most AIE-related studies utilize the idea that applies the aggregation
to turn-on or boost the emission.

2.2 From Restriction of Intramolecular Rotation (RIR)
to Restriction of Intramolecular Motion (RIM)
Why aggregation
brightens emission of AIEgens? Efforts have been continuously devoted
to decipher the AIE working principle. A number of possible working
mechanisms, including conformational planarization, J-aggregate formation,
E/Z isomerization, the restriction of twisted intramolecular charge
transfer, and the excited-state intramolecular proton transfer, have
been put forward, but none of them can be perfectly applicable to
all the AIE systems.12 A correct decipherment
of the working mechanisms of the AIE effect is of great importance
to fundamental understanding, luminogen explorations, and advanced
practical applications.

Theoretically, an excited luminogen
molecule can decay through the photophysical and/or photochemical
pathways.14 The photophysical one includes
nonradiative and radiative processes. The photochemical one includes
a chemical reaction. Therefore, in solution, the excited AIEgens should
decay mainly through nonradiative photophysical or photochemical processes.
In aggregated states, they decay mainly through the radiative photophysical
process. The collective effects give the unique AIE properties.15 We are working on the AIE mechanism through
finding out the detailed decay processes that account for these photo-induced
behaviors.

With persistent efforts, the RIR process has been
first proposed as the mechanism for the AIE effect by our group.12,16 For demonstration, the four phenyl groups and the double bonds in
TPE can rotate freely in dilute solutions in the excited states (Figure 2a), which dissipate
the energy through the nonradiative decay channels. Hence, the TPE
molecules in solution are nonemissive. These intramolecular rotations
are then restricted in the aggregations owing to multiple intermolecular
interactions, blocking nonradiative decay pathways, and enabling excited
states to decay radiatively.17 The RIR
mechanism has been successfully applied to explain different kinds
of fluorescent and phosphorescent AIE systems. Recently, some newly
emerging AIE systems that are absent from multiple rotors bring some
ambiguous issues to the RIR mechanism. For luminogens with vigorously
vibrative moieties such as THBA (Figure 2b), their AIE effects can be interpreted
by the mechanism of RIV.18 Physical knowledge
reveals that any intermolecular movement including rotation and vibration
can dissipate energy. The active vibrational motions of the flexible
parts in THBA play an important role in the radiationless dissipation
of the excited states energy.19

Figure 2 (a) Chemical structure
of tetraphenylethene
(TPE), governed the RIRs. (b) Chemical structure of 10,10′,11,11′-tetrahydro-5,5′-bidibenzo[a,d][7]-annulenylidene (THBA), a TPE derivative
with the AIE effect, working under the restriction of intramolecular
vibrations (RIVs).

In
general, we integrated the RIR with the RIV to the RIM as a more comprehensive
AIE mechanism (Figure 2).7a,18,19f The RIM mechanism
with a broader content provides the simple, fundamental, and comprehensive
AIE mechanism to work together for explaining and expanding the AIE
family. Intrinsically, the intramolecular motion described here boosts
the nonradiative decay rates, arising from the flexible isolated molecular
structures. Upon aggregation, such intramolecular motion is restricted,
contributing to the enhanced structural rigidification and dramatically
decreased nonradiative decay rates.20 Thus,
the radiative relaxation channels dominate. Generally, in an AIE system,
the flexible structure weakens the molecular rigidity and promotes
intramolecular motion to accelerate the nonradiative decay. The aggregation
induces the structure rigidification and blocks the nonradiative decay
channels, making intense fluorescence. Therefore, derived from RIM,
we realized that the structural rigidification of a flexible luminogen
is the intrinsic requirement for AIE systems.21

2.3 From Solid-State
Fluorescence to Room-Temperature Phosphorescence
Compared
to fluorescent luminogens, those with room-temperature phosphorescence
(RTP) enjoy wide applications including the high-efficiency electroluminescence,
bioimaging, photodynamic therapy, temperature monitoring, oxygen sensing,
security inks, and so on, thanks to the long-lived triplet manifold.22 However, pure organic RTP phosphors are difficult
to obtain, because the decay rate of phosphorescence is slow and triplet
excitons could easily lose their energies through nonradiative decay
pathways such as thermally vibrational, collisional processes and
exposure to quenchers. To suppress these relaxation channels, several
approaches have been developed.23 In 2010,
our group discovered the crystallization-induced phosphorescence (CIP)
phenomenon, where some pure organic luminogens such as benzophenone
(BP) derivatives exhibit no emission in solution but become highly
emissive in the crystals.24 Obviously,
CIP is an extension of the AIE family. RIR by effective intermolecular
interactions within the crystal lattice and isolation from oxygen
and moisture are ascribed for the boosted phosphorescence. Moreover,
CIP offers a new strategy for the fabrication of efficient pure-organic
RTP luminogens through crystal engineering. Since then, more and more
reports concerning on the RTP from pure-organic chromophores are demonstrated.25

As shown in Figure 3a, several BP luminogens, including BPH and
its halogen derivatives (BPF, BPCl, BPBr), and BDBF are induced to
emit RTP upon crystallization.24,26 These phosphors are
nonemissive when they are dissolved in good solvents, because the
intramolecular motions quench the triplet excitons through nonradiative
decay pathways. In the crystalline state, intramolecular motions are
restricted in the crystal lattice and multiple intermolecular interactions.
Then, molecular conformation is rigidified, thus making them highly
phosphorescent.

Figure 3 (a) Chemical structures

and their corresponding derivatives; their photographs of the crystals
taken after the stop of UV light irradiation. (b) Schematic representation
of the El-Sayed’s rule for intersystem crossing and molecular
orbital hybridization of the lowest triplet states for tuning the
rate of phosphorescence decay. Generally, a phosphor with high efficiency
and long lifetime requires a balanced hybridization of 3(n,π*) and 3(π,π*) orbitals.

As is well-known, carbonyl groups are effective
spin–orbit coupling promoters for their enhanced intersystem
crossing. Similar to BPH, BZL and its derivatives also exhibit the
CIP feature with high efficiencies at crystalline states.27 Furthermore, we reported a unique phenomenon
of crystallization-induced dual emission (fluorescence and phosphorescence)
in pure-organic aromatic acids and esters.27 Specifically, long afterglow from terephthalic acid and isophthalic
acid is observed (Figure 3a), which is rarely found for pure-organic luminogens.23c To further explore persistent RTP phosphors,
we designed CZBP. Single crystals with dense crystal packing and multiple
intermolecular interactions stabilize the triplet excitons from quenchers,
block the vibrational dissipations, and yield persistent RTP.23e

To obtain efficient pure-organic RTP
luminogens, several internal and external requirements should be fulfilled.
First of all, intersystem crossing from the lowest excited singlet
state (S1) to the triplet excited states (Tn) should be highly efficient. According to El-Sayed’s
rule, intersystem crossing can be greatly promoted through efficient
spin–orbit coupling by mixing the singlet and triplet states
with different molecular orbital configurations (Figure 3b). In spite of efforts to
suppress nonradiative decays by tuning the aggregation behaviors,
we presented a rational molecular structure design principle to achieve
efficient light emission and long lifetime. The hybrid (n,π*)
and (π,π*) configurations of the excited states with the
suitable proportion are the key factors in manipulating the RTP performance.
For the proof-of-concept, aromatic subunits in arylphenones are modulated
to change the energy level and the orbital configurations of the triplet
excitons. Several long-lifetime and high-efficiency pure-organic phosphors
were obtained with different colors at room temperature and in atmosphere,
demonstrating the validity of our rational molecular structure design
principle.26,28

2.4 From Traditional Luminophores to Nonconventional Luminogens
Traditional luminophores are generally constructed by aromatic
groups and conjugated subunits, which function as chromophore centers.
Recently, some nonconventional luminogens such as nonconjugated polymers
and natural products which are free of aromatic building blocks have
been reported.29 On one hand, these nonconventional
luminogens are normally emissive in the aggregates, demonstrating
their AIE characteristics. On the other hand, the emission working
mechanism is quite difficult to decipher and still under dark. They
are neither the typical AIEgen structure nor common conjugated building
blocks.

Individually, researchers attempted to figure out the
effect emissive species to the luminescence. Typically, these polymers
own several electron-rich subgroups, such as N, O, S, P with lone
pair electrons and/or unsaturated CC, CO, and CN subgroups.29 (Figure 4a) These subgroups exist as common nonemissive organic groups,
such as amide, imide, anhydride, ester units, and so on. However,
when they are connected in macromolecules or clusters, they can become
emissive upon aggregation, which has strong implications for the emission
mechanism understanding. Figure 4a demonstrates the cross-linked and through-space interacted
subgroups in the varying nonconventional luminogens clusters. In light
of this, the clusteration-triggered emission (CTE) mechanism may well-explain
the photophysical processes of these nonconventional systems,30 the clusteration of diverse subgroups with subsequent
electron cloud overlapping, and molecular conformation rigidification.

and fluorescent digital photographs of its blue solid powders. (d)
Fluorescent digital photographs of starch, cellulose, and bovine serum
albumin (BSA) solid powders.

As shown in Figure 4b, PAN is a cyanopolymer, which is virtually nonemissive in dilute
dimethylformamide (DMF) solution. Its solid powders emit visible blue
emission upon UV irradiation.30 The authors
then designed and synthesized PNHSMA without any aromatic structures.
PNHSMA is also virtually nonluminescent in dilute solutions but becomes
highly emissive in concentrated solution and in the solid powders
(Figure 4c).31 Furthermore, we reported intriguing bright blue
emission from starch, cellulose, and BSA protein27 (Figure 4d). There are a number of isolated oxygen atoms in starch and cellulose,
which cannot generate visible emission. However, their solid states
can push these electron-rich atoms to a cluster, where the electron
clouds are highly overlapped by the through-space interactions. Meanwhile,
subsequent conjugations and rigidified conformations will also help
the emission. As a result, these clustered subgroups can be excited
and emit visible light. The CTE mechanism is put forth, trying to
explain the interesting emission. Moreover, using this mechanism,
we can also discover and design some other nonconventional luminogens.29a

2.5 From Through-Bond Conjugation to Through-Space Conjugation
Derived from the nonconventional chromophores and CTE mechanism,
we put forth the concept of through-space conjugation together with
the through-bond conjugations to explain these unusual AIE systems.
We found that the poly(maleic anhydride) (PMAh) oligomers emit bright
blue light (Figure 5a).32 Theoretical calculations proved
that the emission is related to the clusteration of the through-space
electron interaction-locked anhydride subgroups. As shown in Figure 5b, the TPE derivative
f-TPE-PPy with a folded conformation is designed and synthesized.
It contains both through-bond and through-space electronic conjugations.
The covalent bonds link the aromatic ring and alkene group, giving
a large π-conjugation molecular structure. On the other part,
the unique folding structure allows the interesting intramolecular
through-space π–π interaction and generates an
electronic delocalization conjugation.33 Lastly, tetrahydropyran (THP) is nonemissive in solution but highly
emissive in crystalline state.34 Lots of
oxygen and nitrogen atoms are electron-rich and packed tightly in
the crystals to facilitate the through-space electronic interaction,
revealing also from the theoretical calculations (pink crescent and
cycles in Figure 5c).35

of f-TPE-PPy anchored onto gold electrodes. (c) Chemical structure
of the racemic THP and its polymorphs under UV light and its molecular
conformations, highest occupied molecular orbitals and lowest unoccupied
molecular orbitals of polymorphs.

Recently, the concept of through-space
conjugation was gradually accepted as a new mechanism of luminescent
chromophores explaining some nonconjugated and/or nonpolar molecules
emitting strong visible light. As shown in Figure 6a, for 1,1,2,2-tetraphenylethane (s-TPE), at a water content of 90%, a strong longwave emission
peak can be seen, while the peak intensity at around 300 nm is also
reduced. Under solid-state conditions, the fluorescence quantum yield
can reach 70% while the emission wavelength reaches 470 nm. Such a
long wavelength and high-efficiency fluorescence emission in the aggregation
state cannot be explained by the traditional theory. The authors illustrated
that in the excited state, the electron cloud of the two benzene rings
with the same carbon will have a delocalization effect, meanwhile
the band gap of the molecules will be drastically reduced, called
through-space interaction.36Figure 6b shows that the luminescence
intensity and wavelength of syn-heptaphenylcycloheptatriene
(Ph7C7H) both increase with the increase of
water content in DMF. In aggregates, the benzene rings from two molecules
will be stacked in parallel and the electron cloud will be delocalized,
that is, the through-space conjugation effect occurs.37 The through-space can illustrate the unusual AIE appearance
reasonably, and it will lead to the electronic delocalization and
reduce the band gap of the molecule, giving a red shift of the emission.

From small molecules to polymers, from traditional luminophores
to the nonconventional luminogens, from organic to organometallic
dyes, AIE has found its constructive roles in diversity luminescent
systems. To make the situation simple and general, these AIEgens can
be classified as the following: homogeneous AIE clustoluminogens and
heterogeneous AIE clustoluminogens (Figure 7c). Illustrated by a string of small firecrackers,
these small firecrackers can be electron-rich atoms, carbohydrates,
amino acids, aromatic subgroups, and so on. They are clustered by
covalent bonds, polymer chains, or even intermolecular interactions
and emissive or nonemissive. After forming aggregates, they behave
as whole luminogens where through-bond or through-space conjugation
acts and RIM and/or CTE functions to make them luminescent. For instance,
TPE can be considered as the homogeneous clustoluminogen, where phenyl
groups and ethylene are clustered by the covalent bond, the through-bond
conjugation makes the molecule as a whole luminophore. The luminescent
polymers are also the homogeneous clustoluminogens. For example, the
luminescent poly(9-vinylcarbazole), the emissive carbazoles are clustered
together by covalent flexible polymer chain, and they emit both as
individuals and groups.38 Even the nonconventional
luminogen, the fluorescent dynamic glycopolymer is a homogeneous clustoluminogen.
The fluorescence should result from the tightly packed structure of
the polymer, where the hydrophobic core isolates and rigidly holds
the aromatic chromophores (Figure 7a). The heterogeneous clusteroluminogens represent
the hybrid systems, where organic counterparts and inorganic counterparts
are clustered as a whole emissive species, no matter whether the counterparts
are emissive or not.39Figure 7b shows an interesting AIE
Au(I)–thiolate complex: strong luminescence emission with a
quantum yield of ∼15%.40 The aggregates
of Au(I)–thiolate complexes were prepared on in situ created
Au(0) cores to generate Au(0)@Au(I)–thiolate core–shell
nanoclusters. The strong luminescence was attributed to the AIE effect
of Au(I)–thiolate complexes on the nanocluster surface and
showed the size-dependent effect.

structure of a dynamic glycopolymer as the fluorescent analogue of
polysaccharides and its fluorescent assemblies characterized by TEM.
(b) AIE effect of oligomeric Au(I)–thiolate complexes through
solvent-induced aggregation and its luminescent photographs. (c) Illustration
of homo-/heterogeneous clustoluminogens by “firecrackers”
where through-bond and/or through-space conjugation within the subgroups
provides effective luminescent chromophores.

From above examples, the homogeneous
clustoluminogens involve pure-organic systems, they can be small molecules,
polymers, supramolecular assemblies, and so on, whereas the heterogeneous
clustoluminogens describe hybrid systems with organic and inorganic
subgroups. There is no requirement of subgroups, even whether they
are emissive or not. They are considered as a whole. The through-bond
and through-space conjugation makes them behave as whole luminogens.
Still governed by RIM and CTE, the luminescence can be lighted up.
As a result, we greatly expand the scope of AIE and offer an attractive
platform of future luminogen research.

3 Perspective and Remarks
Since the concept
was coined in 2001 by our group, AIE has gradually changed people’s
way of thinking about luminogen aggregation and put forth a revolution
of the luminogen research both conceptually and technically. AIE has
established a new platform in the area for novel luminogen exploration
and for multidiscipline researchers to work on. Deciphering the nonradiative
processes that lead to quenching luminogen emission in the solution
and revealing the reasons that bring about radiative decay in the
aggregate is cornerstone of the platform. On the platform, the AIE
has grown up as a “big tree”, where the AIEgens has
great structural diversity: they can be pure hydrocarbons, heteroatom-containing
systems, organometallic molecules, synthetic and natural polymers,
even nonconventional systems, and so on.

Among the AIE systems,
luminogens without traditional chromophores are of particular interest
and will find their bright future as they have huge structure tunability
and multiple functionality. Their unorthodox luminescent processes
are explained by the CTE mechanism and their emitting groups are attributed
to the clusters of electron-rich atoms or subgroups by through-bond
and through-space conjugation. In the clusters, the subgroups tied
up with others to share their electrons and serve as effective clustoluminogens.
Further studies should acquire in-depth insights into the detailed
mechanisms. Also, RTP has been found in metal-free and even nonconventional
AIEgen systems with the aid of the RIM mechanism. It can be envisioned
that the RTP with high efficiency and long lifetime will be attained
by taking advantage of the RIM process and our novel molecular design
principle.

The study of AIE effect has far-reaching practical
implications. AIE systems allow people to make use of the aggregate
process actively, instead of fighting against it. The turn-on characteristic
of the AIEgens makes them promising for real-time monitoring, optoelectronic
devices, mechanochromism inks, and so on. The most thrilling fields
of AIEgens are still in the life science and biomedical research,
such as for in photoimaging of biological structures and bioprocesses.
AIE-related research is booming, which has permeated a large number
of research disciplines with a wide-spread influence. There are many
opportunities as well as challenges on this platform. Grasping the
opportunities and overcoming the challenges will deepen our understanding
and create innovative light-based technologies.

within subgroups provides the effective luminescent chromophores.
