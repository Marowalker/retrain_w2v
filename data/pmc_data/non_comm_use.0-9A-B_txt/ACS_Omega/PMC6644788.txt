Design strategies for small molecular
probes lay the foundation
of numerous synthetic chemosensors. A water-soluble colorimetric calcium
molecular probe inspired by the ionophore-based ion-selective optode
is presented here with a tunable detection range (around micromolar
at pH 7). The binding of Ca2+ resulted in the deprotonation
of the probe and thus a significant spectral change, mimicking the
ion-exchange process in ion-selective optodes. The 1:1 exchange between
Ca2+ and H+ was confirmed with Job’s
plot. Computational studies revealed possible monomer and dimer forms
of the probe–Ca2+ complexes.

Introduction
Synthetic fluorescent
and colorimetric indicators are well-known
analytical tools for the optical detection of various ions.1 Calcium ions, for instance, have become a central
target because of their important role in neuron biology, environmental
science, and food chemistry. Among others, Tsien and co-workers have
developed various calcium indicators for bioimaging purposes such
as Fura-2, Indo-1, and Fluo-3.2 Recently,
calcium probes that emit in the red and near infrared have also been
reported.3,4 Besides bioimaging, synthetic probes that
show drastic color changes are highly attractive because they allow
the rapid and facile detection even with naked eyes. A number of colorimetric
probes for various targets including lots of transition metal ions
have been reported and summarized.5,6 However, colorimetric
synthetic calcium probes remain rarely reported.

Developing
a synthetic probe with a targeted selectivity can be
a trial-and-error trivial task, and the design strategies for small
molecules are quite limited.7 The state-of-the-art
sensing principles include protonation–deprotonation,8 quenching effect,9 photoinduced electron transfer,10 intramolecular
charge transfer,11 aggregation-induced
emission,12 Förster resonance energy
transfer,13,14 and so on. New concepts for the design of
optical molecular probes lay the foundation of numerous synthetic
probes.

For synthetic probes, protonation–deprotonation
was mainly
utilized to the construct pH sensors.7 In
the realm of ionophore-based ion-selective optical sensors (ISOs),
the protonation–deprotonation of the chromoionophores was also
utilized to make optical sensors for various ions.15−18 ISOs represent an important family
of optical ion sensors in close relation to ion-selective electrodes.19 As shown in Figure 1a, for cations such as Ca2+, the
ISOs function on the basis of ion exchange between the organic phase
of the sample part and the aqueous sample solution. In the past few
years, we and others have successfully miniaturized ISOs from polymeric
films to microspheres and nanospheres.20−24 However, it is unclear to what extent one could shrink
the size of ISOs while retaining the sensing principle that features
the ion exchange between the hydrogen ion and the target ion. Rationally,
an ultimate shrinking of the size of ISOs would still lead to a chromoionophore,
an ion exchanger, and an ionophore, where the functions of the three
parts could be combined in one molecule.

Figure 1 (a) Schematic illustration
of the miniaturization and sensing principle
of conventional ISOs. Ion exchanger is omitted for simplicity. (b)
Working principle of the molecular-level optode presented in this
work.

Here, we present a synthetic probe
that responds to calcium ions
in a similar ion-exchange way compared to the working principle of
ISOs. The reported calcium probe is initially associated with hydrogen
ions (on the phenolate). In the presence of Ca2+, it becomes
deprotonated and forms a 1:1 complex with Ca2+. The compound
was characterized spectroscopically, and the sensing process was analyzed
with theoretical calculations.

Results and Discussion
ISOs and
synthetic probes are seemingly very different because
the former rely on the cooperation of multicomponents. In conventional
ISOs, ionophores and chromoionophores are two separate units that
compete with each other for the primary target ions and hydrogen ions,
respectively.15 This approach led to a
large freedom in choosing ionophores and chromoionophores for the
fine-tuning characteristics of the sensing film such as selectivity
and detection range. With the miniaturization of ISOs, we previously
noticed a slight deviation from the ion-exchange principle as the
size of the optodes was reduced to the nanoscale.25 In other words, there is a possible relationship between
the size and the applicability of the ion-exchange principle. To test
the limit of the ion-exchange principle, the functions of chromoionophore,
ion exchanger, and ionophore could be combined into one molecule,
which is readily dissolved in water. On the basis of this concept,
we report here a colorimetric probe for Ca2+ by shrinking
the size of ISOs to the molecular level, leading to a molecular probe
that still functions on the ion-exchange principle of ISOs with a
few different characteristics. As shown in Figure 1b, probe 1 contained a hemicyanine
chromophore which was modified with two acetate arms. Please refer
to the Supporting Information for the detailed
synthesis. Similar to classical ISOs, probe 1 contained
both the chromoionophore moiety and the ionophore moiety (Figure 3a). Importantly,
the two moieties were coupled to each other so that the binding of
either H+ or Ca2+ could result in the unbinding
of the other.

To show that simply having the two moieties in
one molecule is
not enough, a control molecule c1 from fluorescein 5(6)-isothiocyanate
(FITC) and a crown ether derivative was prepared. In compound c1, the two moieties were separated, and thus, the binding
event at one side had a little effect on the other. Indeed, as shown
in Figure 2, the pH
response of c1 was not influenced by the presence of
K+ ions, which is known to be capable of binding to the
crown ether part.

Figure 2 Crown ether–FITC conjugate (probe c1) and its
pH response in the fluorescence mode with and without the presence
of 0.1 M KCl background.

The calcium response of probe 1 (Figure 3a) was evaluated at different pH values. The control of pH
is necessary because probe 1 contains a phenol group
which could deprotonate and cause spectroscopic changes. The pKa of the phenol group was titrated in the absorption
mode and was found to be ca. 7.9 (Figure S1). Therefore, the calcium response of the probe exists only at pH
below the pKa, where the majority of the
phenol groups stays protonated in the absence of Ca2+.
At pH 6, as shown in Figure 3b, without the addition of Ca2+, the absorption
spectrum of 1 exhibited a peak maximum centered at 423
nm, corresponding to the protonation of the phenol group in 1. A slight degree of deprotonation of the phenol group at
this pH was evidenced by the small absorption band around 550 nm.
Ca2+ binding resulted in the removal of the hydrogen ion
of the phenol group and led to the decrease of absorbance at 423 nm
and the increase of absorbance around 525 nm. This process was accompanied
by a transition of color from yellow to pinkish red (Figure 3c), which could be easily observed
by naked eyes. In pH 7 tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane (Tris)-HCl
buffer, the absorbance change during the Ca2+ titration
exhibited the same tendency (Figure 3d). In addition, because of the free acid–base
dissociation, the initial degree of protonation (1-α) became
lower at pH 7 compared with pH 6. At pH above 6, the carboxylates
on probe 1 should be deprotonated, indicating that the
calcium–probe complex is still electrically neutral (assuming
a 1:1 stoichiometry and anions involved in the complexation).

fit of the Ca2+ response at pH 7 using the molecular optode
response model (blue solid line) and the conventional optode theory
for divalent ions (red dashed line). 1-α represents the protonation
degree of probe 1.

This sensing process is in analogy to the ion-exchange process
in traditional ISOs (Figure 1a), where one calcium ion exchanges with two hydrogen ions.26,27 However, a freely dissolved ion complex does not have to be electrically
neutral. Possibly, one calcium ion could exchange with only one hydrogen
ion (or two calcium ions in exchange with two hydrogen ions, see below
in the Computational Analysis section). Figure 3e shows that the
conventional optode theory15 (see eq S1
in the Supporting Information) for divalent
ions could not fit the experimental data of 1 (dashed
red curve). Although other optode theories extending from this equation
could in principle also be used, this optode theory was adopted for
comparison here because of its generality.28 On the contrary, theoretical modeling (in which one Ca2+ exchanges with one H+, see eq S8 in the Supporting Information) provided a very agreeable fitting
(the solid blue curve). Notably, the detection limit of 1 approached 1 μM at pH 7, and the sensitivity of this molecular
calcium probe was doubled compared with classical calcium-selective
optodes. Please refer to the supporting information for theoretical
derivations. Notice that according to the inference from classical
optode theory, the detection limit could be even lower than the micromolar
level if the pH is even higher. This 1:1 stoichiometry was further
confirmed with Job’s method.29 As
shown in Figure 4,
the maximum of the corrected absorbance was found around 0.5 on the
mole ratio fraction of ligand scale, indicating a 1:1 complex stoichiometry
in pH 7.0 Tris-HCl buffer solution. Job’s method was also applied
at pH 6.0 and 6.4, and the same stoichiometry was obtained (Figure S2). Moreover, computational models also
revealed a 1:1 stoichiometry for the interaction between 1 and Ca2+ including monomer and dimer interactions (see
below and Figures S14 and S15 in the Supporting Information).

Figure 4 Job’s plot for probe 1 and Ca2+ obtained
in pH 7.0 Tris-HCl buffer in UV–vis absorption mode. Concentration
of the probe varied from 0 to 100 μM as the Ca2+ concentration
decreased from 100 to 0 μM.

The selectivity of ionophore-based optical sensors is very
important,
and it typically relies on the ionophore of choice. As shown in Figure S3, the ionophore moiety of probe 1 provided a relatively high selectivity to Ca2+, especially over the commonly seen interfering ions including Na+, K+, Mg2+, Li+, and Cs+. The influence of some heavy metal ions was also evaluated,
and lead(II) was found to cause interference (Figure S4). This result limited the potential application
of this probe to samples free of high lead(II) concentration. For
biomedical samples such as blood serum and urine samples, calcium
detection with this probe is still feasible. The response time of
the probe to calcium ions was very fast. Although stopped-flow method
was not able to provide the accurate response time because of sample
mixing limitations, the color change after adding Ca2+ to
the probe solution was visually observed instantaneously.

As
this work focused on a more probe design, we further evaluated
whether both the acetate arms were involved in calcium binding. For
this purpose, a single-armed probe (c2) was also synthesized
(see the Supporting Information). Aqueous
solutions of c2 showed no spectral change upon addition
of calcium ions at all (data not shown), nor did the addition of other
alkali and alkali earth metal ions. These observations indicated that
the additional chelating arm was indeed indispensable.

For ISOs,
it is well-known that the sensor response is pH dependent.25 Therefore, the sample pH should be well controlled
or monitored in real time to avoid misinterpretation of the signal
change. In most cases, this pH cross response was regarded as the
major disadvantage of ISOs. However, on the other hand, when used
as in vitro assays where the sample pH could be manually controlled,
the response range could be adjusted. Here, the calcium response range
of probe 1 showed similar characteristics. As shown in Figure 5, an increase in
pH was able to shift the response range to lower calcium concentrations.
Experimental evaluation was performed from pH 5 to pH 7. At pH 7,
some spontaneous deprotonation was already observed, and a further
increase in pH would reduce even further the signal sensitivity. Importantly,
the general tendency was very similar to ISOs. However, the response
range shifted only ca. 1 logarithm unit upon changing 1 pH unit, whereas
in classical ISOs, changing 1 pH unit could shift the response curve
by 2 logarithm units for divalent ions such as Ca2+. This
mismatch could be explained by our theoretical consideration, where
one Ca2+ exchanges with one H+ and renders the
behavior of compound 1 more analogues to ISOs for monovalent
ions.

Figure 5 Optical response curves of probe 1 to Ca2+ at pH 5, 6, and 7 fit with theoretical response curves.

After unsuccessful attempts to obtain the single-crystal
structures,
density functional theory (DFT) and LCC2 calculations were conducted
to elucidate the binding mode of Ca2+ with a model chromoionophore 1 (A1) and its effect on the absorption energy
(see Supporting Information for computational
details). As shown in Figure 6, all the five oxygen atoms of the phenolate and two acetate
parts can coordinate to a Ca2+ ion in a Ca2+-bound monomer complex B1 (Ca–O: 2.24–2.61
Å). Each Ca2+ ion was also found to coordinate with
six oxygen atoms from the acetate and phenolate parts in a Ca2+-bound dimer complex C1 (Ca–O: 2.27–2.60
Å), where each Ca2+ can tightly bind with the phenolate
moieties of two chromoionophores. These results support the observed
two key acetate arms for the Ca2+ binding. The TD-CAM-B3LYP-computed
absorption energy for A1 is about 416 and 412 nm in the
gas phase and water, respectively, whereas the high-level LCC2 method
gives an absorption energy of ∼465 nm for A1.
In the presence of Ca2+ ion(s) in complexes B1 and C1, their absorption energies computed by the time-dependent
(TD)-DFT (∼468–492 nm) and LCC2 (∼513 nm) methods
becomes red-shifted. These computational results are qualitatively
consistent with the observed red-shifted absorption by adding Ca2+ ions (Table 1).

Conclusions
To summarize, this work demonstrated that the sensing concepts
in ionophore-based ion-selective optodes can be adapted to create
synthetic molecular probes. Binding of the target ion (e.g., Ca2+) resulted in the deprotonation of the probe and thus absorption
spectral changes. This process was thought to mimic the ion-exchange
process in ISOs. The probe here could serve as a colorimetric calcium
indicator with a micromolar detection limit, tunable sensing range,
and high selectivity. Computational and theoretical analysis revealed
that this probe undergoes deprotonation upon binding with calcium
ions in a 1:1 ratio, which was further confirmed with Job’s
plot. The analogy between classical ISOs and this molecular level
ISO was provided including the sensing mechanism, pH dependence, and
sensitivity. Notably, the sensitivity was doubled compared to conventional
ISOs for divalent ions. The selectivity over alkali and alkali earth
metal ions was excellent. However, lead ions were able to cause severe
interference which could limit some potential applications. Overall,
these fundamental studies provided a manual to guide any future use
of this probe in real samples. Meanwhile, this work also lays the
foundation for the design and understanding of other synthetic probes
based on the ISOs principles.

Instrumentation
and Measurements
The ultraviolet–visible
(UV–vis) absorption spectra were recorded on an absorption
spectrometer (Evolution 220, Thermo Fisher Scientific). The fluorescence
signals were measured with a fluorescence spectrometer (Fluorolog-3,
Horiba Jobin Yvon). Calcium response in the absorption mode was evaluated
with a 10 μM probe concentration in pH buffer solutions (5 mM
pH 7.0 Tris-HCl, 5 mM pH 5.0 or 6.0 MES-NaOH) with a stepwise addition
of CaCl2 stock solutions to reach the required concentrations.
The pH response of the probe was titrated in a universal buffer solution
with a gradual addition of 1 M NaOH stock solutions while the pH values
and the absorption spectra were recorded. Experiments to obtain Job’s
plot were performed using mixtures of probe 1 and CaCl2 in three different pH buffer solutions according to previous
procedures.

Computational Analysis
Several possible
conformations
for a model probe (in which the ethyl group on the nitrogen was simplified
by one methyl group), a Ca2+-bound monomer complex, and
a Ca2+-bound dimer complex were first optimized by B3LYP-D3/6-31G(d)
in the gas phase. The vibrational frequency calculations were then
conducted on the optimized structures at the same level of theory
to verify every optimized structure as local minimum. Then, their
vertical absorption energies were evaluated by TD-CAM-B3LYP/6-311+G(d),
TD-B3LYP/6-311+G(d), and LT-DF-LCC2/def2-TZVPP methods. The solvent
effect on their absorption energies and geometries were also included
by PCM TD-DFT and PCM B3LYP-D3/6-31G(d) methods in water, respectively.
The Gaussian 09 and Molpro programs were used for the above-mentioned
calculations. Please refer to Tables S1–S4 and Figures S12–S17
