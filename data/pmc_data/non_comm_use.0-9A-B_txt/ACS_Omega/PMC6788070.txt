Room-temperature
reactions between [Cp*CoCl]2 (Cp* =
η5-C5Me5) and large excess
of [BH2E3]Li (E = S or Se) led to the formation
of homocubane derivatives, 1–7. These species
are bimetallic tetrahomocubane, [(Cp*Co)2(μ-S)4(μ3-S)4B2H2], 1; bimetallic trishomocubane isomers, [(Cp*Co)2(μ-S)3(μ3-S)4B2H2], 2 and 3; monometallic
trishomocubanes, [M(μ-E)3(μ3-E)4B3H3] [4: M = Cp*Co, E
= S; 5: M = Cp*Co, E = Se and 6: M = {(Cp*Co)2(μ-H)(μ3-Se)2}Co, E = Se],
and bimetallic homocubane, [(Cp*Co)2(μ-Se)(μ3-Se)4B2H2], 7. As per our knowledge, 1 is the first isolated and
structurally characterized parent prototype of the 1,2,2′,4
isomer of tetrahomocubane, while 3, 4, and 5 are the analogues of parent D3-trishomocubane. Compounds 2 and 3 are
the structural isomers in which the positions of the μ-S ligands
in the trishomocubane framework are altered. Compound 6 is an example of a unique vertex-fused trishomocubane derivative,
in which the D3-trishomocubane [Co(μ-Se)3(μ3-Se)4B3H3] moiety is fused with an exopolyhedral trigonal bipyramid (tbp)
moiety [(Cp*Co)2(μ-H)(μ3-Se)2}Co]. Multinuclear NMR and infrared spectroscopy, mass spectrometry,
and single crystal X-ray diffraction analyses were employed to characterize
all the compounds in solution. Bonding in these homocubane analogues
has been elucidated computationally by density functional theory methods.

Introduction
Homocubanes1 are noncyclopropanoid homologues
of cubane2 (C8H8)
derived by the introduction of one, two, three, and so forth, methylene
groups into the cubane skeleton. Cubane and its derivatives were the
first saturated polycyclic caged hydrocarbons to gather interest because
of their potential applications in the production of high energy fuels.2c,3 Despite the ease of storage, handling, and proficiency under standard
conditions, the synthesis of cubane is challenging as it involves
multiple steps.2d,4 The rich chemistry of these molecules,
by virtue of their inherent strain energy, has been widely exploited
in the recent past.1a,4,5 Despite
notable growth in this field, the quest for homocubane-type species
met with little success. Adams and co-workers reported homocubanes
of cobalt (I–III) from the reaction
of [CpCo(CO)2] with chalcogen powders.6 Even though there are reports of homocubane-type molecules
combining transition metals and chalcogen elements7 (I–IV, Chart 1), examples of such molecules involving boron
in the cubane core, are rather limited.

Chart 1 Different Types of
Homocubane Analogues; I–VII Previous Work, 1 This Work.
Boron is a typical
electron-deficient nonmetal element in group
13 with unique structural and bonding properties, and because of this,
it can form diverse clusters with both the main group as well as transition
metal elements.8−10 In addition, the incorporation of boron into transition
metal clusters can alter the electronic properties. In line with our
motivation to establish a new synthetic route for transition-metal
boron compounds with interesting molecular structures,8−11 we found that [(Cp*Mo)2B4E2] (E
= S, Se or Te) and nido-[(Cp*RuH)2B3H7] clusters are very good synthons for synthesizing
cubane-type molecules.8 Recently, we have
reported various trimetallic cubane-type clusters from the [Cp*TaCl4] and thioborate ligand [BH2S3]Li reaction.9b However, homocubane type of species eluded us
till the dimetallapentaborane analogue, nido-[(Cp*RuH)2B3H7], generated homocubane species
[(Cp*Ru)2Mn(CO)3(CS2H2)B3H4] (V) when treated with [Mn2(CO)10].11a Subsequently,
the isolation of electron-precise 1,3-bishomocubane derivatives [(Cp*Rh)2(μ-E)2(μ3-E)4B2H2], (VI: E = S; VII: E = Se), obtained from the reaction
between nido-[(Cp*Rh)2B3H7] and chalcogen powders,11b encouraged
us to extend this approach to the cobalt system. In this article,
we report the isolation and structural elucidation of dicobaltaheteroborane
analogues of higher order homocubanes.

Results and Discussion
Reactivity
of [Cp*CoCl]2 with [BH2E3]Li; (E
= S or Se)
The reaction of [Cp*CoCl]2 with 10
equiv. of [BH2E3]Li (E = S
or Se)12 at room temperature, yielded a
series of cobaltachalcogenaborane analogues of higher order homocubanes, 1–7 in 6–17% yields (Scheme 1). The reactions also yielded few other compounds
albeit in less yields and hence could not be isolated. Reaction with
[BH2Te3]Li led to the decomposition of the starting
materials. Even though these compounds formed in a mixture, it was
possible to separate them as crystalline solids through chromatographic
workup by preparative thin-layer chromatography (TLC). The detailed
spectral and structural characterizations of 1–7 are discussed below.

Scheme 1 Syntheses of Homocubane Analogues 1–7
Tetrahomocubane Analogue, 1
Compound 1 was isolated along with 2 as inseparable brown
solids. As we were unable to separate these two molecules by TLC,
the compounds were primarily characterized by combined NMR and mass
spectrometric data.13 The combined mass
spectrum of 1 and 2 obtained by the electron
spray ionisation (ESI) technique, exhibits molecular ion peaks at m/z 667.9108 and 635.9366. The room-temperature 11B{1H} NMR displays four chemical shifts in the
range δ = 5.2 to −13.9 ppm. The 1H NMR displays
three chemical shifts for Cp* protons at δ = 1.32, 1.20, and
1.18 ppm. The 1H resonances at δ = 1.32 and 1.18
ppm appeared with equal intensities. The 13C{1H} NMR also displays chemical shifts that corroborate with three
Cp* environments. The infrared (IR) spectrum shows broad bands in
the 2519–2363 cm–1 region because of stretching
frequencies of the terminal B–H. The core geometries of the
compounds, 1 and 2, could not be interpreted
unless an X-ray structure analysis for one of them was done. In an
attempt to separate compounds 1 and 2 by
fractional crystallization, we could manage to get few crystals of 1 from the solution that helped us determine the crystal structure
of 1.

The X-ray structural analysis established
the structural identity of 1. It crystallizes in an orthorhombic
crystal system with the Pnma space group. The solid-state
X-ray structure of 1, shown in Figure 1, presents an open-core cubane with four
μ-S ligands bridging four elongated B–S edges of the
cubane framework [Co2S4B2]. The number
and the positions of these μ-S bridges, in an otherwise inherently
cubane structure, are the most intriguing features of 1. Based on these features, the structure may be considered as a dicobaltathiaborane
analogue of the 1,2,2′,4-isomer of parent tetrahomocubane [C12H16] wherein three of the μ-S ligands are
positioned around B1 bridging B1–S1, B1–S4, and B1–S4
edges of the cube while one μ-S ligand is at B2, bridging the
B2–S6 edge. Even though both the boron atoms in 1 are in a tetrahedral environment with three S and one H, the S–B–S
bond angles deviate abnormally from 109.5° (maximum deviation
of 21.7°). The planarity of the square face Co–S–Co–S
in 1 is also noticeably lost (maximum deviation is 11.9°).
The average bond length for B–S and Co–S of 1.866 and
2.233 Å, respectively, is comparable with metallathiaborane clusters14 (1.875 and 2.351 Å).

S4–B2–S4 97.8(8).

Compound 1 possesses crystallographic mirror symmetry,
which is defined by the B1–S2–S1–S6–S5–B2
plane. This makes the Co atoms, residing on either side of the plane,
chemically equivalent. Therefore, all the Cp* protons should correspond
to a single chemical shift in the 1H NMR spectrum. Interestingly,
even though the mirror plane passes through two boron atoms (B1 and
B2), their chemical environments are dissimilar. While B1 is connected
to three μ-S units, B2 is connected to two μ3-S and one μ-S units. Although it was not possible to locate
the terminal B–H protons of 1 by X-ray diffraction
analysis, the 1H{11B} NMR and IR spectra along
with the mass spectrometric analysis confirmed their presence. Synthesis
of higher order homocubanes or their derivatives is still a big challenge
to synthetic chemists. The only tetrahomocubane core reported till
date is observed in tetraasteran-1,4,5,8-tetracarboxylic acid, as
pentacyclo[6.4.0.02,7.04,11.05,10]dodecane, (1,3,5,7 isomer of tetrahomocubane;15aFigure 2). Therefore, to the best of our knowledge, 1 is the
first prototype of pentacyclo[6.3.1.02,6.03,11.05,10]dodecane or 1,2,2′,4 isomer of tetrahomocubane
(Figure 2).

In general, most of the cubanes and their derivatives are electron
precise species following two center–two electron (2c–2e)
bonding, wherein the metals obey the 18-electron rule while the main
group elements follow the octet rule.16 Compound 1, a dimetalla analogue of tetrahomocubane
(C12H16) [cve = 64; {8 (CH) × 5 + 4 (CH2) × 6}], possesses 84 cve count [2 (Cp*Co) × 14
+ 8 (S/Se) × 6 + 2 (BH) × 4] thereby satisfying the 2c–2e
formalism. A similar situation has also been observed for other bishomocubane
derivatives [(Cp*Rh)2(μ-E)2(μ3-E)4B2H2] (E = S or Se) and
[(Cp*Ru)2(μ-E)2(μ3-E)4B2H2] (E = S or Se).11b,17

Bimetallic Analogues of Trishomocubanes, 2 and 3
Compound 3 was isolated in a moderate
yield, as a brown solid. The mass spectrum of 3 displayed
a molecular ion peak at m/z 635.9366
which suggested the molecular formula C20H32B2S7Co2. The 11B{1H} NMR of 3, at room temperature, showed two
chemical shifts at δ = 7.1 and 5.2 ppm. The 1H NMR
displayed two signals at δ = 1.36, and 1.19 ppm for the Cp*
protons signifying the possibility of two chemically distinct boron
and metal environments. Crystals suitable for X-ray diffraction were
obtained by cooling a concentrated hexane/CH2Cl2 (80:20) solution at −10 °C.

The X-ray diffraction
analysis of 3 revealed a trishomocubane core, which is
crystallized in an orthorhombic crystal system and Pnma space group. As represented in Figure 3, two structural residues are present in
the unit cell of the solid-state crystal structure (additional details
of the disorder are discussed under the X-ray structure details in
the Supporting Information) crystal structures
were constructed by segregating the highly entangled molecules into
two meaningful core geometries and were found to exist as two interpenetrating
disordered molecules related closely by a mirror plane.18 In addition to this, both the residues corresponded
to identical structural parameters thereby establishing themselves
as mirror equivalents or enantiomers. Hence, the molecules cannot
be distinguished by multinuclear NMR spectroscopy or by mass spectrometry
as they would correspond to identical chemical shifts in NMR spectroscopy
and would give similar isotopic distribution pattern in mass spectrometry;18 all the spectroscopic data for 3 validate this fact.

The molecular structure of the
mirror equivalent isomers of 3 is comparable to that
of 1 and other cubane
cores8,11b with three μ2-S ligands
bridging two elongated B–S edges and one Co–S edge of
the [Co2S4B2] core. The tetrahedral
environment of two B atoms defined by two μ3-S, one
μ-S, and one H atom each, is also reflected in the S–B–S
bond angles which closely match with 109.5° (maximum deviation
7.8° in case of S6–B2–S7). The presence of the
μ-S bridge, viz. the Co1–S1–S7
link, distorts the planarity of the Co–S–Co–S
square face (maximum deviation 24.5°). Even though the average
B–S bond length in 3 is slightly longer (1.906
Å) as compared to other metallathiaborane clusters,16 the B1–S4 bond length is fairly shorter
(1.797 Å). The average Co–S bond length of 2.246 Å
is shorter relative to some of the reported metallathiaborane clusters.14

As discussed earlier, compound 2 was isolated along
with 1 as an inseparable mixture. One of the molecular
ion peaks in the combined mass spectrum of 1 and 2, which appeared at m/z 635.9366, is identical with that of 3. Thus, based
on the mass spectrometric data together with the combined spectroscopic
data, the composition of 2 may be considered as C20H32B2S7Co2. Therefore,
we assume that compound 2 may be another isomer of dimetalla
trishomocubane species. Although we were able to get the X-ray quality
crystals for 1, unfortunately we failed to get the crystals
for 2. However, the solution of 3 in CH2Cl2 on keeping at room temperature for several
days converted to 2. The spectroscopic and mass spectrometric
data enabled us to conclude that 2 and 3 are interconverting isomers (Scheme 2).

Scheme 2 Conversion of 3 to 2 at
Room Temperature
Fortunately, compounds 2 and 3 can be
separated using toluene as an eluent. This enabled us to get the spectroscopic
data of pure 2 and helped us assign all the combined
spectroscopic data for 1 and 2. Two resonances
are observed at δ = 5.2 and 3.6 ppm in the 11B{1H} NMR of 2. Hence, the signals at δ =
−4.6 and −13.9 ppm in the combined 11B{1H} NMR may be assigned for 1. Similarly, the 1H NMR spectrum of 2 shows two resonances corresponding
to Cp* protons at δ = 1.32 and 1.18 ppm therefore, 1H chemical shift at δ = 1.20 ppm in the combined 1H NMR spectrum has been assigned to Cp* protons of 1. Further, the 1H chemical shift values of 2 also suggest the presence of two different metal environments.

Unfortunately, in spite of several attempts, we were unable to
grow crystals of 2 for the X-ray diffraction analysis.
However, from the spectroscopic data in combination with the mass
spectrometric data of 2, it is rational to assume that
compounds 2 and 3 are geometrical isomers.
The structure of 2 which is shown in Schemes 1 and 2 and Figure 4, is
one of the possible isomers only.

functional theory (DFT) optimization.

Monometallic Trishomocubane Analogues, 4–6
The reactions of [Cp*CoCl]2 and [BH2E3]Li (E = S or Se) also yielded compounds 4 and 5 as orange solids. Multinuclear NMR and IR spectroscopy
were used to characterize both the compounds. The mass spectrometric
data for 5 shows a molecular ion peak at m/z 783.6853 suggesting the composition of 5 as C10H19B3Se7Co. The 11B{1H} NMR spectra of 4 and 5 are very similar showing a single resonance at
δ = 6.3 and 0.2 ppm, respectively, suggesting symmetry in the
molecules. Their 1H NMR spectra displayed the signals for
a single Cp* at δ = 1.51 and 1.57 ppm, respectively. In addition,
the 1H NMR spectra of 4 and 5 showed chemical shifts in the region of δ = 3.69–5.05
ppm for the terminal B–H protons. The 13C{1H} NMR spectra also indicate the occurrence of one Cp* in agreement
with the molecules being symmetrical. The IR spectra of 4 and 5 showed peaks at 2473 and 2462 cm–1 due to stretching frequency of the terminal B–H bond.

Therefore, based on all the spectroscopic data of compounds 4 and 5, we assume that both of them have similar
geometry. The framework geometry of one of the analogous compounds
(4) was established by single crystal X-ray diffraction
analysis. As shown in Figure 5a, the structure of 4 can be regarded as a trishomocubane
core, in which {CoS4B3} defines the cubane core
with three μ2-S ligands bridging three elongated
B–S edges of the CoS4B3 framework. The
core geometry of 4 is closely related to that of 3; the Cp*Co fragment in 3 is substituted by
a BH unit in 4. The X-ray crystallographic data establish
that 3 and 4 are probably the first metalla-chalcogenaborane
analogues of pentacyclo[6.3.0.02,6.03,10.05,9]undecane known as D3-trishomocubane19 The D3-trishomocubane
is the smallest stable rigid organic molecule belonging to the chiral
point group D3.19b−19d All the boron atoms are in a symmetrical tetrahedral environment
provided by three S and one H atom. The average bond length of 1.899
Å is somewhat higher as compared to that of other metallathiaborane
clusters.14

The reaction between [Cp*CoCl]2 and [BH2Se3]Li, in addition to yielding 5, also yielded
a brown compound 6 (Scheme 1). The constituents of 6 were
confirmed by means of multinuclear NMR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry,
and single crystal X-ray diffraction analysis. The mass spectrum of 6 shows a molecular ion peak at m/z 1194.3456 which suggests a molecular formula C20H34B3Se9Co3.The 11B{1H} NMR spectrum, at room temperature, exhibits
a single resonance at δ = −44.6 ppm suggesting a symmetry
in the molecule. This was further supported by the presence of a single
resonance in the 1H NMR spectrum corresponding to Cp* protons.
Consistent with the 11B{1H} and 1H NMR spectra, the 13C{1H} NMR spectrum also
supports the presence of symmetry. Moreover, the 1H NMR
spectrum shows an upfield peak at δ = −3.60 ppm. The
IR spectrum features a band at 2437 cm–1 because
of B–H stretching frequencies. Although the spectroscopic data
of 6 resemble that of 5 to some extent,
the mass spectrometric data implies otherwise. The core structure
could be comprehended only after an X-ray structure analysis was carried
out with a brown rod-shaped crystal of 6.

The X-ray
structure of 6, shown in Figure 5b, can be considered as a vertex-fused
cluster in which a trishomocubane moiety [Co(μ-Se)3(μ3-Se)4B3H3] and
a trigonal bipyramid (tbp) cluster [{(Cp*Co)2(μ-H)
(μ3-Se)2}Co] are fused by a cobalt atom
(Co1). The core geometry of 6 is similar to 4 or 5, in which the Cp*Co fragment is replaced by the
[{(Cp*Co)2(μ-H) (μ3-Se)2}Co] moiety. The boron atoms in 6 are in a symmetrical
tetrahedral environment similar to that in 4 and 5. The Se–B–Se bond angles deviate slightly
from 109.5° (maximum deviation ∼6.8°), whereas the
basal plane deviates distinctly from planarity (maximum deviation
11.9°). The average B–Se bond length in 6 (2.043 Å) is notably longer as compared to that in [(Cp*Mo)2B4Se2H4] (1.923 Å).20

All the spectroscopic data of 6 agreeably corroborate
with its X-ray structure. The 1H chemical shift at δ
= −3.60 ppm is designated to the Co–H–Co proton.
Typically, the 1H chemical shift for the Co–H–Co
proton appears in the up-field region;21 however, the HSQC experiment does not support the existence of any
Co–H–B or B–H–B protons. In addition,
on lowering the temperature, the 1H chemical shift at δ
= −3.60 ppm is shifted to the up-field region.

Further,
the computed 1H chemical shift for the corresponding
Co–H–Co proton closely matches with the experimental
value (Table S4).

The electron counting
rules22 by Wade,
Mingos, Jemmis, in addition to connecting borane, metallaborane, metallaheteroborane,
or metallacarborane clusters in a simple manner, also provided a perception
for the assessment of the electronic requirements of varied cage and
ring structures. Thus, the cluster valence electron (cve) counts of
the trishomocubane analogues 2–6 were carried
out, which were found to be in good agreement with the hydrocarbon
homologue C11H14. For illustration, the cve
for C11H14: 8 (CH) × 5 + 3 (CH2) × 6 = 58; for 2 and 3: 2(Cp*Co)
× 14 + 7 (S) × 6 + 2 (BH) × 4 = 78; for 4 and 5: 1(Cp*Co) × 14 + 7 (S/Se) × 6 + 3 (BH)
× 4 = 68. For 6, the total valence electron count
around Co1 can be calculated as 14 [9 (from Co1) + 1 (from Co1–Co2)
+ 1 (from Co1–Co3) + 3 [2 (from Se1/Se2–Co3) + 1 (from
Se1/Se2–Co3)], which is equivalent to that of Cp*Co [9 (from
Co) + 5 (from Cp*)]. Therefore, based on the electron contribution
to Co1, the exo-{(Cp*Co)2(μ-H)(μ3-Se)2} fragment can be compared with the Cp* ligand
which makes 6 an electron precise trishomocubane analogue.

In addition to the formation of compounds 5 and 6, the reaction of [Cp*CoCl]2 and [BH2Se3]Li at room temperature also allowed us to isolate
compound 7 as a grey solid. The mass spectrum featured
a molecular ion peak at m/z 807.7211.
The 11B{1H} NMR spectrum for 7 features
two sharp signals with equal intensities at δ = −5.6
and −12.9 ppm. Although the 1H NMR spectrum displayed
a peak at δ = 1.58 ppm because of Cp* protons, the 13C{1H} NMR spectrum indicates that two different metal
environments are present in the compound. The occurrence of a single
chemical shift in the 1H NMR at δ = 1.58 ppm for
two equivalents of Cp* may be owed to the accidental overlapping of
two peaks. The IR spectrum showed a broad band in the 2453 cm–1 region for the terminal B–H units. The 1H{11B} NMR experiment additionally confirmed the
existence of the terminal B–H units.

An X-ray diffraction
study was done for ascertaining the molecular
structure of 7. Compound 7 shows a single
μ2-Se ligand bridging the B1–Se4 edge of the
cube (Figure 6). The
average B–Se bond length in 7 (2.111 Å) is
longer as compared to that of [(Cp*Mo)2B4Se2H4]20 (1.923 Å)
and [(Cp*Ru)2(μ3-Se)(μ4-Se)B2H5]11b (2.014
Å).

[2 (Cp*Co) × 14 + 5 (Se) × 6 + 2 (BH) × 4], thereby
agreeing with the electron precise hydrocarbon homologue C9H10 [cve count 46; 8 (CH) × 5 + 1 (CH2) × 6] and obeying the electron counting rule.

Electronic
Structure Calculations
The DFT calculations
were done to understand the electronic structures of the homocubane
derivatives 1–7 in a gas phase, with GGA BP86
as a functional and def2-TZVP basis set included Grimme’s D3
dispersion corrections. The optimized geometrical parameters of 1–7 were found to almost agree with the crystallographic
data obtained from X-ray structure analyses (Table S1). The computed and experimental values for 1H
and 11B{1H} chemical shifts were given in Table S4.

The molecular orbital analyses
show a relatively higher highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO)–lowest
unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy gap for 4 (2.01
eV) compared to other homocubane analogues 1–3 and 5–7 (Table S2); the gap is minimum for 6 (Figure S33). The frontier molecular orbitals of all the molecules
indicate that the HOMO is mostly localized at chalcogen E (S or Se)
which suggests that the lone pairs of electrons are on E. On the other
hand, the LUMO is located on Co which is antibonding interaction with
E (E = S or Se) (Figures S33 and S34).
The total percentage contribution of Co, chalcogen E (E = S or Se),
and B to the HOMO and LUMO of all molecules are listed in Table S3. The HOMO of all molecules clearly suggests
that their donation ability through the chalcogen E end, which may
be useful to study the reactivity with small molecules such as silanes,
boranes, and alkynes and so on. The natural charges obtained from
natural bond orbital (NBO) analyses, shown in Table S2, reveal that all the cobalt and boron atoms show
positive and negative charges, respectively (Table S3). The Wiberg bond index analyses suggest strong bonding
interactions at Co–E, B–E, and E–E bonds (E =
S or Se, Table S1). The NBO calculations
further support these bonding interactions, notably Co–H–Co
bonding interaction (Figure S35). In addition,
the analysis of the topology displays bond critical points (BCPs)
between Co–E and B–E bonds, which suggests relatively
similar charge distribution for 1 at Co2E
and E2B planes and for 5 and 6 at CoE2 and B2E planes (Figures 7, S36 and S37).
The BCPs also signify higher electron density at B–E relative
to that of Co–E bonds. Furthermore, electron localization function
(ELF) values and negative energy density (H(r)) values indicate that the B–E bonds are more covalent
in nature as compared to the Co–E bonds (Table S5).

(∇2ρ(r) > 0). Blue dots

Electronic Spectra
The cubane cores of the homocubane
clusters 1–7, consist of either one or two metal
centers. Therefore, UV–vis spectra were recorded, for compounds 1–7, in CH2Cl2 (Figure 8), so as to see the absorption
pattern. The absorption pattern for these complexes seem to be like
that seen in the case of homometallic cubane clusters [(Cp*Mo)4(μ4-BH)3B4H4]8b and [(CpNi)4B4H4].23 The pattern also resembles
that observed for the homometallic ruthenium cubanes, (i–iv) generated from nido-[(Cp*RuH)2B3H7].8c All the compounds
displayed a strong absorbance in the region 311–326 nm, which
may be designated to π–π* transitions of the cyclopentadienyl
ligands (Table 1).
On the other hand, the bands in the region 375–563 nm may be
because of charge transfer transition (MLCT). All the absorption bands
manifest a red shift on moving from [(CpNi)4B4H4] to 1–7 (ca. 30 nm) (Table 1). In spite of the presence
of Cp*, the π–π* transition bands in compounds 1–7 show a red shift unlike in compounds i–iv, where it shows a blue shift.

Conclusions
In
summary, we have isolated and structurally characterized a series
of unusual mono and dicobalta higher-order homocubane analogues, viz. tris and tetrahomocubane. All the structures possess
essentially a cubane core, differing only in number and position of
the μ2-E (E = S or Se) bridges thereby generating
a classified collection of derivatized homocubane analogues. The vertex-fused
trishomocubane derivative, in which the [Co(μ-Se)3(μ3-Se)4B3H3] moiety
is fused with an exopolyhedral trigonal bipyramid moiety, is quite
exceptional. Synthesis of higher order homocubane or their derivatives
is still a challenge and we believe that the approach we have utilized
in this work might give an access to higher order homocubane analogues.

Experimental
Section
General Procedures and Instrumentation
The operations
were carried out under an Ar atmosphere by means of standard Schlenk
line methods and glovebox. Solvents were distilled before use under
an Ar atmosphere. [LiBH4·THF], S, and Se powders were
used as purchased from Sigma Aldrich. [Cp*CoCl]224 and [BH2E3]Li12 have been synthesized as per the literature
methods. The reaction mixtures were separated by TLC which was done
on silica gel TLC plates by Merck supported with 250 μm diameter
aluminum. 500 MHz Bruker FT-NMR spectrometer, Agilent Technologies:
6545-Q-TOF LC/MS, JASCO FT/IR-4100 spectrometer, and Evolution 300
UV–vis spectrophotometer were used to record NMR, ESI mass,
IR, and absorption spectra, respectively. Signals for residual protons
in the deuterated solvents were used as reference in 1H
NMR (CDCl3, δ = 7.26 ppm, C6D6, δ = 7.16, toluene-d8, δ
= 7.09). For the 11B{1H} NMR analysis, a sealed
tube containing [Bu4N(B3H8)]25 in C6D6 (δB = −30.07 ppm) was used as an external reference. Absorption
spectra were recorded at 298 K.

Synthesis of Compounds 1–3 and 4
[Cp*CoCl]2 (0.1 g, 0.218 mmol) was suspended
in 10 mL toluene at room temperature, in a Schlenk tube which was
flame-dried. To that, [BH2S3]Li (2.18 mmol),
was added as freshly prepared solution in toluene. The reaction then
was allowed to stir for 16 h at room temperature. Drying of the solvent
was done under vacuum followed by extraction of the residue in n-hexane/DCM (50:50 v/v) by passing through Celite. The
solvent was then removed and the resulting residue was then put through
chromatographic work-up by means of TLC plates. Elution with n-hexane/CH2Cl2 (50:50 v/v) yielded
inseparable brown 1, 2, and 3 (0.042 g; Rf = 0.5)
and orange 4 (0.030 g, 15%; Rf = 0.66). Further elution with toluene separated
inseparable brown 1 and 2 (0.020 g; 14%; Rf = 0.66) (from the 1H NMR we understood that the product ratio of 1 and 2 is 3:2, respectively) and brown 3 (0.020 g,
14%; Rf = 0.5).

a Note that compound 2 was isolated in pure from compound 3 that allowed
us to assign the spectroscopic data of both 1 and 2 without any ambiguity. Moreover, although the spectral data
of 1 could be comprehended from the molecular structure of 1, the 11B{1H} and 1H chemical shift values
could not be unambiguously assigned until the pure spectroscopic data
for 2 was realized.

The cve of bishomocubane derivative, [(Cp*Rh)2(μ-E)2(μ3-E)4B2H2] is 72 [14(Cp*Rh) × 2 + 6(S, Se)
× 6 + 4 (BH) × 2] and for ruthenium analogue [(Cp*Ru)2(μ-E)2(μ3-E)4B2H2] (E = S or Se) it is 70. Note that the
shortage of two electrons for the latter is supplemented by the formation
of one Ru–Ru bond.
