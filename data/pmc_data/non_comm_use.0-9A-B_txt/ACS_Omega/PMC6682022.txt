Investigating
the feasibility of betanin and pectin extraction
from Opuntia ficus-indica peel via
microwave-assisted hydrodiffusion and gravity, this study identifies
selected important economic and technical aspects associated with
this innovative production route starting from prickly pear fruit
discards. Which benefits would be derived from this process? Would
production be
limited to Opuntia-growing countries
or, likewise to what happens with dried lemon peel chiefly imported
from Argentina, would production take place abroad also? Can distributed
manufacturing based on clean extraction technology compete with centralized
production using conventional chemical processes?

==== Body
1 Introduction
We have lately discovered
that microwave-assisted hydrodiffusion
and gravity (MHG) applied to the peels of red and green fresh Opuntia ficus-indica (OFI) fruits harvested in Sicily
affords under solvent-free and mild extraction conditions (1 h extraction
at 70 °C) a red natural extract mostly containing betalains,
pectin, and polyphenols.1

After storage
for 4 months at room temperature, the extract fully
retains its original red color, pointing to the lack of betanin molecular
degradation. The lyophilized pectic polymer obtained after ready separation
via dialysis has a high degree of crystallinity and 53% degree of
esterification (DE).1

Closing the materials cycle and offering a low energy route to valorization
of a biological resource so far mostly discarded as an agro-food industry
waste, the method establishes a circular bioeconomy method to obtain
two valued bioproducts from biowaste available in significant amounts.

Widely approved as a food additive (label E162 in the EU), betanin
is a valued violet-red betacyanin stable at pH between 3.8 and 6.8
and particularly well suited for use as a natural colorant in beverage,
confectionery, bakery, dairy, and frozen products.2

Used as a food colorant in desserts, bacon burgers,
ice-cream,
jams, jellies, liquorice, meat soup, sauces, and sweets, the dye is
currently obtained from red beetroot (Beta vulgaris L var. ruba) after 2 years of cultivation.2 Shifting its production to Opuntia
ficus-indica giving its fruits several times a year
would be highly desirable.

Similarly, pectin is the most sought-after
natural hydrocolloid
in the food industry.3 Sourcing pectin
from the peel of OFI fruits would provide an alternative to current
production routes based on dried lemon and orange peel or apple pomace
as raw materials. Well characterized in 2004,4 the structural features of Opuntia’s pectins provide them with rheological and functional behavior
ideally suited as thickening and gelling hydrocolloids in food, personal
care products, and pharmaceutical applications.5,6

Pioneered by Chemat and Visinoni,7 the
MHG extraction technology, combining microwave heating and earth gravity
at atmospheric pressure, has rapidly emerged as one of the most attractive
techniques to extract and to separate value-added bioproducts from
biological matrices.

Its advantages include high reproducibility,
less energy consumption,
shorter procedures, higher purity of the final product, elimination
of the organic solvent, and consequent elimination of waste effluents.8

Investigating the feasibility of betanin
and pectin extraction
from OFI peel via MHG, this study identifies selected important economic
and technical aspects associated with this innovative production route,
starting from prickly pear epidermis.

2 Results
and Discussion
Scheme 1 shows the
solvent-free conditions process1 lately
developed on the laboratory scale for the extraction of pectin and
betanin involves milling the fresh peel with the aid of a knife and
irradiation with microwaves for 1 h so as to heat the mixture at 70
°C.

Scheme 1 Extraction of Pectin and Betanin from OFI Peels via MHG
The aqueous extract undergoes
dialysis to separate the pectic polymer
from betanin and biophenols. Pectin precipitated with ethanol at −18
°C is isolated in the form of highly pure crystals via lyophilization.
The same treatment is used to isolate stable betanin powder enriched
with biophenols (two phenolic acids, and 10 flavonoids including isorhamnetin,
quercetin, and kaempferol derivatives) present in the peel of OFI
red and white fruits.9

The decentralized
extraction of pectin and betanin from OFI peel
on a semi-industrial scale might be carried out, for example, using
a MAC-75 (Milestone, Italy), namely, a digitally controlled and integrated
extractor for the industrial production of extracts on small scale
(75 L rotating drum).10

Energy consumption
for one processing cycle would amount to 8.7
kWh (Table 1).

Table 1 Energy Consumption per Extraction

The extraction
of pectin and betanin from the OFI fruit peel via
MHG transforms a cost item into a revenue item. Currently, for instance,
a fruit processing company based in Sicily (Italy) using the OFI fruits
to extract juice either pays waste processing companies to dispose
waste OFI peel or gives away for free the fresh peels which are used
for cattle feeding.

Besides the initial capital investment required
to purchase the
extractors (one MAC-75 sells at 160–170 k€), the two
major costs faced by a company willing to extract betanin and pectin
from OFI fruit peels would be: (i) labor and (ii) electricity needed
to power the extractor and the lyophilizer.

Driven by the megatrend
global demand for “naturals”,
pectin has become the preferred natural hydrocolloid at food and beverage
companies. The current 60 000 tonnes, $1.2 billion market,11 is forecast to grow at >7% annual rate until
2025.12

The price of extracted pectin
(E440) has been steadily increasing
in the course of the last decade11 to reach
current values at around $8.00/lb for high methoxyl (HM) and around
$9.00/lb for low methoxyl (LM) pectin.13 We remind that commercially pectins are classified according to
their methoxyl content: pectin commercial grades with DE lower and
higher than 50% are classified as LM and HM pectins, respectively.
When designing pectin gels for specific applications, it is important
to consider simultaneously the DE, the monosaccharide content (homogalacturonan,
HG), and the spatial disposition of the cross-linking blocks (RG).

Similarly, the price of extracted betanin (beetroot red, E162)
is high and its demand is generally increasing.2

For example, by early 2019, powdered beetroot red
extract ready
for use as a natural food colorant was sold online by an Italy’s
food colorant manufacturer at €130/kg.14 European specifications for beetroot red E162 define that not less
than 0.4% of the commercial material must be betanin pigment, with
the remaining 99.6% being composed of sugars, salts, and proteins
naturally occurring in red beets and a small amount of other betalains.15

Globally, already in 2009, 10 per cent
of the global demand of
food colorants (45 000–50 000 tonnes) was met
by beetroot red.16 The beetroot powder
market (90 000 tonnes, $15 billion) in 2016 is forecast to
expand at a compound annual growth rate of 5% until 2027.17

A number of unique technical advantages
can be expected from extracting
pectin and betanin from the peels of OFI fruits via MHG technology.

First, the quality of pectin, obtained under acid-free and solvent-free
conditions, is particularly high. The process results in pectin having
larger percentages of “hairy” rhamnogalacturonan I (RG-I,
the side chains of mainly α-l-arabinofuranose and α-d-galactopyranose) regions that promote the formation of more
entangled structures, which plays a gel-stabilizing role.18

On the other hand, the relative content
in galacturonic acid [HG,
regions: partially 6-methylated and 2- and/or 3-acetylated poly-α(1–4)-d-galacturonic acid residues] “smooth” regions
estimated for pectin from OFI peel is low in comparison to those of
citrus or grapefruit pectin and for most commercial ones.19

The relative proportions of interconnected
HG and RG-I regions
determine the flexibility and rheological properties of the polymer
in solution: the HG regions enhance molecular interactions, whereas
the branched RG regions promote the formation of entangled structures.20

Extracting pectin via the conventional
hydrolytic process in hot
acidic water, Rodríguez-Hernández and co-workers have
already shown that pectin extracted from the peel of Opuntia albicarpaScheinvar “Reyna” fruits has enhanced ability to form soft and elastic gels when compared
to lemon-derived pectin.21

Second,
the betanin extract of endless stability obtained, thanks
to the concomitant presence of high amounts of antioxidant polyphenols
present in the OFI fruit’s peel is of unique technical relevance.
Stable at acidic pH, betanin extracts, in general, suffer from poor
stability against oxidative degradation.22 This single aspect so far has limited the use of betalain natural
pigments as functional ingredients (and health promoters) in nutraceutical,
pharmaceutical, and cosmetic products, requiring the development of
costly optimal processing conditions to maximize the stability of
betalains and their extraction yields.22

Third, the absence of acid and added solvent including water
to
directly obtain the aqueous mixture of valued bioproducts in the fruit
peel cell water itself affords an entirely green process of higher
yield (no production losses: all extractable pectin and betanin are
extracted), producing no effluents and thus requiring no treatment.8 Along with the cost of the dried citrus peels,
the cost of the treatment of diluted acidic waters obtained in conventional
pectin plants is the highest among those faced by pectin manufacturing
companies.11

Fourth, no drying of
the peels is required. The very same polyphenols
abundantly present in the peel have a potent antibacterial, antioxidant,
and fungicide activity.9 This prevents
the rapid microbial degradation of the peel as it happens with the
peel of squeezed citrus (lemon and orange) fruits requiring rapid
and costly drying prior to pectin extraction.

Fifth, widely
and increasingly harvested OFI affords its fruits
several times per year, offering an excellent potential alternative
to both citrus and red beetroot as a natural source of pectin and
betanin.

Sixth, the extraction process is intrinsically safe:
the lack of
flame and noise reflects into safer, healthier, and more comfortable
operation conditions.8 Besides lowering
insurance costs, the latter are key advantages for manufacturing bioproducts
which are sold to food, nutraceutical, cosmetic, and pharmaceutical
companies.

Seventh, with complete photovoltaic (PV) systems
now routinely
installed in Italy at approximately $1/W for systems of nominal power
>50 kW,23 the cost of electricity of
the
extraction company would be reduced by self-producing the electricity
through a PV array whose cost, because of the solar energy revolution
that occurred in the last decade,24 has
now reached unprecedented low levels.

3 Conclusions
The concomitant extraction of pectin and betanin in the stabilized
form from OFI peels using MHG under solvent-free conditions is technically
feasible.

Microwave-based hydrodiffusion and gravity extraction
processes
in reactors optimized to ensure good homogeneity of heating and good
product transfer with capacities up to many hundred kilograms per
hour indeed are already commercialized.8,10,25

Can the concomitant MHG extraction of pectin
and betanin from Opuntia’s agro-food
industry fruit waste be
also made economically viable in comparison to pectin multistep chemical
extraction in large plants, and beetroot red hydroalcoholic in smaller,
dedicated plants?

A thorough techno-economic analysis will quantify
the economic
benefits, the return on investment, and the payback times to answer
this question in detail. Of relevance to the present bioeconomy study
addressing the use of a prominent green chemistry technology to produce
two bioproducts in high and increasing demand are the key differences
with the conventional approach to scaling up chemical processes.

Rather than aiming to scale up the process in batch, first on a
pilot scale and then, following optimization, in large industrial
plants, the MHG technology applied to the present circular economy
process directly targets production using a series of batch reactors
in parallel or one continuous flow reactor. The setup time is brief,
essentially consisting of the commissioning time.

Rather than
aiming at economies of scale of manufacturing in large
production units typical of chemical productions, the process aims
to produce pectin and betanin at the rate of customer demand, with
quick, clean, and flexible production capable to meet the variable
customer demand, with no stock throughout the process and with the
ideal batch size being one.26 Similar to
Ohno’s production system, which focuses on the flow of the
work, this production mode tolerates higher unit costs, as it would
not be dependent on low costs per unit.26

Remarkably, with the emergence of new manufacturing technology,
a similar trend from centralized to decentralized and distributed
manufacturing, allowing products to be manufactured and distributed
close to customers, is being observed for many productions.27 The same technology shift is clearly emerging
also for natural product extraction based on new technology.28

Finally, the energy (electricity) required
to carry out the process
under mild conditions will be mostly self-produced from sunlight,
thanks to today’s low cost and digitally managed PV technology
equipped with energy storage in Li-ion batteries and solar hydrogen,
to maximize energy self-consumption and enable natural product production
in developing regions and nations where solar irradiation is plentiful.29
