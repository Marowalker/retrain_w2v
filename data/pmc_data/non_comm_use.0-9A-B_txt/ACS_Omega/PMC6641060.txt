Free-radical polymerization with
a thermochemical initiator, which
usually takes hours to complete, was dramatically accelerated under
reaction conditions mimicking the deep-sea hydrothermal vents, where
reaction mixtures were only briefly exposed to ultrahigh temperatures
under pressure. In tests using acrylic acid and potassium persulfate,
poly(acrylic acid) (Mn = 2.1 × 104, Đ = 2.73) was obtained in 5.2 s with
the monomer conversion of 60.3% in water at 200 °C and 25 MPa
without using any catalysts. The process that we call heat-shock-induced
polymerization may pave the way for an entirely new strategy in reaction
engineering for developing extremely fast, green, and scalable processes
for polymer synthesis.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Nature
is a source of inspiration for innovation,1−3 and extreme
environments in the deep sea, such as hydrothermal vents,
are fascinating from this perspective. The hydrothermal vents are
hot springs in the deep sea, where hot and compressed water, sometimes
in the supercritical state (Tc = 374 °C, Pc = 22.1 MPa),4 gushes
out from the sea floor. Molecules in cold deep-sea water around the
hydrothermal vent are instantaneously heated to a very high temperature
when they are engulfed in the vent water stream and immediately quenched
to a near-freezing temperature when they get out of the stream. The
extreme environments in the deep sea, such as the hydrothermal vents,
are so foreign to those of us on the surface that inspiration from
them has a potential to help break even the status quo in chemical
processes that are deemed mature and well-established, such as mixing
oil and water in the form of emulsions.5

Free-radical polymerization is a mature and well-established
process
for synthesizing polymers, and recent scientific efforts in the field
of radical polymerization have been devoted primarily to controlled
radical polymerization.6−8 Nevertheless, 100 million tons of polymers are still
synthesized every year by free-radical polymerization,7 and the importance of further innovating the process cannot
be overlooked.

Thermochemical initiators such as potassium persulfate
(KPS) and
2,2′-azobisisobutyronitrile are commonly used to initiate free-radical
polymerization. Their rates of decomposition follow the first-order
reaction kinetics and are accelerated at elevated temperatures. In
principle, the higher the reaction temperature is, the faster the
polymerization should proceed. In practice, however, the reaction
temperature is typically chosen so that the half-life of the initiator
is ca. 10 h (60 °C in the case of KPS in water). This is because
when the reaction temperature is set too high, rapid decomposition
of the initiator generates high concentrations of propagating radicals
in a reaction mixture, which rather accelerate termination over propagation,
thereby giving only oligomers, not polymers. We found that poly(acrylic
acid) (PAA) was formed when free-radical polymerization of acrylic
acid (AA) with KPS was carried out under reaction conditions mimicking
the hydrothermal vent, where the reaction mixtures were only briefly
exposed to ultrahigh temperatures under pressure.

2 Results and Discussion
The process that we call heat-shock-induced
polymerization (HIP)
was performed on a flow-type reactor that was designed and developed
to allow brief treatment of aqueous solutions at high temperatures
and high pressures up to the supercritical state of water.5 A schematic diagram of the reactor and a typical
operating condition are shown in Figure 1.

Figure 1 Schematic representation of the flow-type reactor.
T1, T2, and
T3 represent thermocouples. T2 and T3 directly measured the temperature
of the fluid in the reactor, whereas T1 measured the temperature of
the mixing tee. Detailed descriptions of the reactor can be found
elsewhere.5

To water that was fed to the reactor at 5.0 mL min–1 and heated in a preheat coil to the desired temperature, an aqueous
solution containing 10 wt % AA and 0.1 wt % KPS was injected at 2.5
mL min–1. By this way, the reaction mixture was
rapidly heated to the ultrahigh reaction temperature. The mixture
was kept at the ultrahigh temperature while it passed through a reaction
tube (1.74 mm i.d., 314 mm long) that was heated by electric heaters.
At the outlet of the tube, cold water was injected at 2.5 mL min–1 to cool down the reaction mixture. The reaction mixture
was further cooled in a cooling coil immersed in a water bath that
was kept to 14 °C, depressurized, and collected from the outlet
of a back-pressure regulator. All reactions were performed at a fixed
pressure of 25 MPa, which was above the critical pressure of water
and high enough to prevent boiling of water regardless of the reaction
temperature.

For the sake of simplicity, we here define the
reaction temperature
as the temperature that was recorded at the inlet of the reaction
tube (T1) (Table S1). Similarly, the reaction
time is defined as the residence time of the reaction mixture in the
heated tube. The net flow rate to the heated tube was kept constant
at 7.5 mL min–1. Owing to the change in the density
of water in the temperature range studied (Figure S1),9 the reaction time changed
from 6.0 s at 21 °C to 4.0 s at 350 °C (Table S1).

Formation of PAA was confirmed by size exclusion
chromatography
(SEC) in a reaction mixture that was treated at 200 °C and 25
MPa for 5.2 s (Figure 2). The number average molecular weight (Mn) and the molecular weight dispersity (Đ)
of the polymer were 2.1 × 104 and 2.73, respectively.
The monomer conversion was 60.3%. The formation of PAA was not ascribed
to pure thermal polymerization because the same reaction without KPS
did not give the polymer.

Figure 2 SEC profile of PAA synthesized by HIP at 200
°C and 25 MPa
for 5.2 s.

The monomer conversion strongly
depended on the reaction temperature
(Figure 3). For the
reaction time of 6.0 s, polymerization did not proceed noticeably
below 70 °C. PAA was obtained when the reaction temperature was
raised to 100 °C with the monomer conversion of 8.0%. The monomer
conversion sharply increased with the temperature above 100 °C
and reached 60.3% at 200 °C. It gradually decreased with the
temperature above 200 °C.

Figure 3 Monomer conversion of AA (red) and calculated
degree of thermal
homolytic cleavage of KPS (blue) as a function of reaction temperature.

The rate constant, kd, of thermal hemolytic
cleavage of KPS is reported as  where R and T are the gas constant and the absolute temperature, respectively.10 Assuming that the pre-exponential factor is
temperature-independent, we used the equation to calculate the degree
of thermal cleavage of KPS at different reaction temperatures (Figure 3, blue). Calculation
showed that for the reaction time between 4.0 and 6.0 s (Table S1), significant thermal cleavage occurred
only above 120 °C. The steep increase of the monomer conversion
was observed in the similar temperature range in which thermal cleavage
of KPS was facilitated.

At 200 °C at which the highest
monomer conversion was obtained,
the same calculation showed that 95% of KPS should have been cleaved
in 300 ms. It was likely that thermal cleavage of KPS was completed
as soon as the reaction mixture was injected and mixed with very hot
water coming from the preheat coil. Indeed, no further polymerization
occurred when the reaction mixture before dialysis was reheated to
70 °C for 24 h, confirming that all initiators were consumed
during the reaction. Increasing the initiator concentration 3 times
while keeping the AA concentration the same did not affect the monomer
conversion either. Thermal degradation of AA was unlikely to happen,
as AA was formed as a degradation product when lactic acid was treated
in water at 385 °C and 34 MPa for ∼30 s.11

The reaction time at ultrahigh temperatures should
have been kept
short for successful polymerization, because thermal degradation was
observed when a 0.5 wt % solution of commercial PAA (M = 4.5 × 105) was processed in the flow-reactor at
200 °C and 25 MPa for 5.2 s (Figure S2). The SEC profile showed that high-molecular-weight fractions were
preferentially degraded. The result agrees well with thermogravimetric
analysis measurements that showed weight loss of solid PAA above 200
°C.12 Thus, chain formation and chain
degradation simultaneously occurred at 200 °C, and the latter
should have become dominant at longer reaction times. The result in
turn suggests that the ceiling temperature of AA may exist around
200 °C. To the best of our knowledge, the ceiling temperature
of AA was not measured previously.10 This
could be a reason why the monomer conversion did not increase but
gradually decreased above 200 °C. Other possibilities include
shorter reaction time at these temperatures (Figure S1).

The reaction temperature also affected the molecular
weight and
molecular weight dispersity of PAA (Figure 4). Mn and Đ of PAA obtained at 100 °C were 1.2 × 105 and 7.10, respectively. In contrast, PAA obtained above 200
°C had significantly smaller molecular weight and molecular weight
dispersity. Both Mn and Đ did not depend very much on the reaction temperature above 200 °C.
Smaller Mn of PAA obtained above 200 °C
would be ascribed to the fact that nearly instantaneous thermal cleavage
of KPS above 200 °C generated a high concentration of propagating
radicals and termination occurred more frequently.

Figure 4 Change of Mn (red) and Đ (blue) of PAA obtained
by HIP as a function of temperature.

PAA obtained at 150 and 175 °C had bimodal molecular
weight
distribution, thus giving a large Đ (Figure 5). The bimodal molecular
distribution suggests distinctly different mechanisms for polymerization
at 100 °C at which the thermal cleavage of KPS was slow and polymerization
at temperatures above 200 °C at which the thermal cleavage of
KPS was nearly instantaneous. Presumably, the former gave PAA with
higher Mn, whereas the latter gave PAA
with smaller Mn. Both mechanisms operated
at intermediate temperatures at which the thermal cleavage of KPS
was moderately fast, thereby giving the bimodal molecular weight distribution.

Figure 5 SEC traces
of PAA obtained by HIP at 100 (blue), 150 (black), and
200 °C (red). For comparison, the traces were normalized by setting
the height of the profiles to unity. The monomer conversion was 8.0%
at 100 °C, 55.6% at 150 °C, and 60.3% at 200 °C.

1H NMR spectroscopy
revealed that the mode of termination
was different between conventional free-radical polymerization and
HIP. In 1H NMR spectra of PAA, signals due to protons of
end-groups of the polymer chain appear between 5.5 and 6.5 ppm.13,14 In the spectrum of PAA that was obtained by conventional free-radical
polymerization with KPS at 70 °C for 24 h (Figures 6A and S3), signals
due to protons of the end-groups that were generated by disproportionation
(Figure 6B,C) and initiating
terminals (Figure 6D) dominated this region. Integration of the peaks showed that 50%
of the PAA chains were terminated via combination and 50% via disproportionation.

Figure 6 (A) 1H NMR spectra of PAA synthesized by conventional
free-radical polymerization at 70 °C, HIP at 150 °C, and
HIP at 200 °C. Full spectra are shown in Figure S3. (B–D) Assignments of the peaks in (A).

Both signals also appeared in
the 1H NMR spectrum of
PAA obtained by HIP at 150 °C. In this case, however, combination
was favored over disproportionation (72 vs 28% based on integration
of the peaks) (Figure 6A).

In the spectrum of PAA obtained by HIP at 200 °C,
the signals
due to protons of the end-groups that were generated by disproportionation
were not observed at all. The result shows that termination by disproportionation
did not occur in HIP at 200 °C but occurred predominantly by
combination. Termination may have also occurred by other processes,
such as chain transfer to polymer backbones (backbiting) or water
molecules. In either case, it is evident that the mode of termination
of HIP was very different from conventional free-radical polymerization.

The fast completion of polymerization in HIP is clearly ascribed
to nearly instantaneous homolytic cleavage of KPS at ultrahigh temperatures.
However, this should, in principle, accelerate termination of the
propagating radicals at the same time, which is in part evidenced
by the smaller Mn of PAA obtained by HIP
above 200 °C compared to that of PAA obtained at 100 °C
(Figure 4). Accordingly,
free-radical polymerization at a very high temperature usually ends
up in the formation of oligomers. For formation on polymers, the propagating
radicals need to be stabilized in some way during the reaction.

The lack of termination by disproportionation in HIP should give
the propagating radicals longer lifetimes. In addition, termination
by combination involves collision of bulky macromolecular radicals
and is less favored at higher temperatures,15 which also helps to give the propagating radicals longer lifetimes.
It is not clear at present why disproportionation does not occur in
water at high temperatures and high pressures, but properties of water
at high temperatures and high pressures would likely play an important
role.

Properties of water other than the density (Figure S1) are also very different at high temperatures
and
high pressures where HIP was performed.16 Under a constant pressure of 25 MPa, the viscosity of water decreases
from 8.9 × 10–4 Pa s at 25 °C to 1.4 ×
10–4 Pa s at 200 °C. The dielectric constant
decreases from 79.3 at 25 °C to 35.7 at 200 °C.9 The equilibrium constant for the water dissociation, Kw, increases from 10–14 mol2 L–2 at 25 °C to 10–11 mol2 L–2 at 200 °C.17 All of these changes should affect various thermodynamic
and kinetic aspects of free-radical polymerization, including stabilization
of radicals by the cage effect, solvation of reactants, diffusion
of macromolecular radicals, and dissociation of AA. Suppression of
disproportionation in HIP is likely a consequence of the interplay
of these effects.

It is worth mentioning that use of the flow-type
reactor is crucial
in performing HIP for two technical reasons. First, the reaction mixtures
must be rapidly heated to an ultrahigh temperature because of the
very fast cleavage kinetics of KPS. Second, the reaction time at ultrahigh
temperatures must be kept short to minimize thermal degradation of
PAA. Such brief treatments in water at ultrahigh temperatures and
pressures with short heating (and cooling) times are technically feasible
by the flow-type reactors but not by the conventional batch reactors.18

3 Conclusions
In summary,
PAA was successfully synthesized by brief exposure
of aqueous solutions of AA and KPS to ultrahigh temperatures under
pressure. At the optimal reaction condition, PAA was obtained in 5.2
s with the monomer conversion of 60.3% without using any catalysts.
Nearly instantaneous cleavage of KPS and stabilization of the propagating
radicals would likely lead to the successful synthesis of PAA with
narrow molecular weight dispersity within an unprecedented short reaction
time. Considering the scalability of high-temperature and high-pressure
continuous processes, wherein semi-industrial-scale production of
functional nanoparticles was already demonstrated,19,20 HIP may pave the way for an entirely new strategy in reaction engineering
for developing extremely fast, green, and scalable processes for polymer
synthesis.

Studying polymerization kinetics is crucial to elucidate
the reaction
mechanism of HIP and clarify advantages of HIP over conventional free-radical
polymerization. However, we found that the present reactor was not
suitable for performing polymerization at different reaction times.
In principle, longer reaction times should be achieved by lowering
the flow rate of the reaction mixture to the reactor. In practice,
however, the reaction temperature considerably changed with the flow
rate. This was because the hot reaction mixture served as a medium
to heat up the reaction tube, as well as the electric heaters around
it. Work is in progress in our laboratory to develop a new reactor
to address these technical limitations, as well as to improve the
monomer conversion, control the molecular weight of PAA, and apply
HIP to other water-soluble monomers.

Apart from these, water
at high temperatures and high pressures,
including supercritical water, attracted considerable scientific interest
as a green medium for chemistry because of their very different properties.21−23 However, owing to the high temperature, degradation reactions such
as hydrolysis and pyrolysis usually dominate the chemistry. The situation
changes dramatically when the reaction time is kept short. For example,
when aqueous solutions of glycine are briefly exposed to high temperatures
and high pressures, dehydration condensation of glycine proceeds,
leading to the formation of oligoglycine up to a hexamer.24 Abiotic condensation of amino acids around the
hydrothermal vent may have played a pivotal role in the chemical origin
of life.24 The present study shows that
brief treatment in water under such extreme conditions also provides
interesting opportunities for synthetic organic chemistry involving
radical species.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials
AA containing 200 ppm monomethyl
ether hydroquinone (MEHQ) as an inhibitor was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich
Co. (St. Louis, MO). MEHQ was removed by passing through an inhibitor
remover column (Sigma-Aldrich) before use. KPS and PAA (M = 4.5 × 105) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Co.
and used as received. Millipore water was used throughout the work.
The dialysis membrane for purification of PAA (Spectra/Por 7, molecular
weight cutoff: 1000 Da) was obtained from Spectrum Laboratories, Inc.
(Rancho Dominguez, CA).

4.2 Monomer Conversion
Monomer conversion
was measured gravimetrically. The reaction mixture was dialyzed against
water overnight to remove unreacted monomers and initiators. The dialyzed
solution was completely dried under vacuum at 120 °C, and the
residue was weighed.

4.3 SEC Measurements
Molecular weight
distribution of the polymer was analyzed by SEC. The SEC system consisted
of the Prominence GPC system (Shimadzu Corp., Kyoto, Japan). SEC was
made using TSKgel GMPWXL and TSKgel guardcolumn PWXL (both from Tosoh Corp., Tokyo, Japan), which were connected
in series. Samples were eluted by 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH = 6.9)
at 40 °C at the flow rate of 1.0 mL min–1.
The SEC system was calibrated using a standard sample of pullulan
(P-82; Showa Denko K.K., Tokyo, Japan).

4.4 1H NMR Spectroscopy
1H NMR spectra of PAA
were recorded on Bruker Avance III 400
MHz. Solutions of PAA after dialysis were lyophilized, and residues
were redissolved at the concentration of ca. 2.0 wt % in D2O (99.9 atom % D, Sigma-Aldrich) containing 0.2 wt % 4,4-dimethyl-4-silapentane-1-sulfonic
acid as an internal standard. The spectra were recorded at 25 °C
and were integrated 256 times.
