Carbon
nanotube–lysozyme (LSZ) conjugates provide an attractive
combination of high strength and antimicrobial activity. However,
there has not been a direct comparison of the covalent and noncovalent
methods for creating them. In this work, single-walled carbon nanotubes
(SWNT) were functionalized with LSZ using both noncovalent adsorption
and covalent attachment via N-ethyl-N-(3-dimethylamino-propyl) carbodiimide hydrochloride–N-hydroxysuccinimide (EDC–NHS) chemistry. The amount
of attached lysozyme, dispersion stability, and antimicrobial activity
was compared. In addition, the mechanical properties of LSZ–SWNT
in poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) composite films were investigated. Dispersions
of covalently bound LSZ–SWNT had better dispersion stability.
This was attributed to covalent functionalization enabling sustained
SWNT dispersion at a lower LSZ/SWNT ratio. The covalently bound LSZ–SWNT
also exhibited a lower initial rate of antibacterial response but
were active over a longer time scale. Composite films made from LSZ–SWNT
maintained similar activity as the corresponding dispersions. However,
the noncovalent LSZ–SWNT films were stronger and more hydrolytically
stable than those made from covalent LSZ–SWNT.

==== Body
Introduction
In recent years, research on the combination
of carbon nanomaterials
with proteins and enzymes has been driven by two desires: (1) enabling
aqueous dispersions and (2) combining carbon nanomaterials’
electrical, mechanical, thermal, or optical properties with those
inherent in biological materials.1−7 Adducts of lysozyme (LSZ) and carbon nanomaterial have attracted
particular interest due to the enzyme’s natural abundance,
inherent antibacterial activity, and stability. In addition, both
experimental and computational investigations have shown that lysozyme’s
tryptophan residue has favorable interactions with sp2-hybridized
carbon nanomaterials. These interactions enable dispersion of single-walled
carbon nanotubes (SWNT),2,8−11 multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWNT),12 graphene oxide,13 and fullerenes such
as C6014,15 at higher concentrations than
can be achieved with many other biological or synthetic dispersion
aids. LSZ–carbon nanomaterial dispersions have been used to
produce antimicrobial carbon nanotube films and fibers16,17 and sort nanotubes by size.18

While
much of the research has focused on attaching LSZ to carbon
nanomaterials via noncovalent interactions, this approach does have
some disadvantages. For SWNT, efforts to increase the concentration
of LSZ–SWNT dispersions result in depletion attraction and
nanotube aggregation above 0.15 vol% SWNT at a 2.1:1.0 LSZ:SWNT ratio.16 Therefore, achieving higher concentrations more
suitable for film or fiber production requires a different approach.
Horn et al. added both a surfactant and a polymer to create dispersions
with higher SWNT concentration, which could be dry-spun into antimicrobial
fibers with toughnesses greater than spider silk.16 Similarly, Nyankima et al. used a poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA)
solution to produce transparent antimicrobial films.17 In contrast, Merli et al. demonstrated that LSZ could be
covalently attached to multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWNT) using standard N-ethyl-N-(3-dimethylamino-propyl) carbodiimide
hydrochloride–N-hydroxysuccinimide (EDC–NHS)
chemistry; this approach resulted in greater antimicrobial activity
than native LSZ.19 To date, there has not
been a direct comparison of covalently and noncovalently functionalized
LSZ–SWNT adducts. This paper reports a comparison of the two
functionalization methods using spectroscopic and thermal gravimetric
characterization and turbidimetric assays for antibacterial activity.
In addition, a comparison of antibacterial and mechanical properties
of composite LSZ–SWNT–PVA films made from the dispersions
is reported.

Results and Discussion
Differences
between covalently and noncovalently functionalized
LSZ–SWNT were evaluated in terms of relative dispersion concentrations,
differences in interactions based on Fourier transform infrared (FTIR)
spectra, supernatant antimicrobial activity, and the antimicrobial
activity and mechanical properties of LSZ–SWNT–PVA films.
The noncovalently functionalized LSZ–SWNT were prepared and
characterized using previously established methods.8,16,17 Covalent attachment was performed using
EDC–NHS chemistry following the method developed by Merli et
al. for LSZ functionalization of MWNT.19 The LSZ and SWNT concentrations for noncovalent functionalization
were chosen for consistency with the previous work.17 The concentration of the covalently functionalized LSZ–SWNT
was chosen to be consistent with SWNT concentration in noncovalent
LSZ–SWNT dispersions (e.g., 1 mg/mL covalent LSZ–SWNT).

Comparison
of Attachment Methods
The initial dispersions
from each method are referred to as mixtures in the remainder of this
manuscript. Centrifugation of each mixture at 17 000g for 3 h resulted in supernatants, which contained individual
LSZ–SWNT and small LSZ–SWNT bundles. Supernatants of
noncovalently functionalized LSZ–SWNT also contained free LSZ.
As described in Materials and Methods, the
concentrations of each component in the supernatants and amount of
bound LSZ were determined using a combination of UV–vis spectroscopy
and thermal gravimetric analysis, based on previously reported methods.8,16,17 These results are shown in Table 1. Repeated washing
of the noncovalently functionalized samples showed that only 18–25%
of the total LSZ was bound to the SWNT. However, as anticipated, rinsing
the covalently functionalized LSZ did not reveal any free LSZ. Interestingly,
while the initial LSZ/SWNT ratio (by mass) was higher for the noncovalent
dispersion, fewer LSZ molecules were bound per SWNT than in the covalent
functionalization.

Since covalent functionalization
results in the conversion of sp2- to sp3-hybridized
carbon, Raman spectroscopy
was used to verify covalent attachment. The G band located at 1592
cm–1 is due to tangential stretching of sp2-hybridized carbon, while the D band located at 1356 cm–1 is due to tangential stretching of sp3-hybridized carbon.
Therefore, the ratio of the intensities of the D and G peaks is a
facile way to verify covalent functionalization.20Figure 1a shows the Raman spectra for the pristine SWNT, noncovalently functionalized
LSZ–SWNT, and covalently functionalized LSZ–SWNT using
a 514 nm laser. The D/G ratios for the pristine and noncovalently
functionalized SWNT were within the experimental error with average
values of 0.11 and 0.08, respectively. For the covalent LSZ–SWNT,
the D/G ratio increased to 0.22 consistent with covalent functionalization.

a 514 nm laser of SWNT and both covalent and noncovalent LSZ–SWNT.
(b) FTIR spectra of covalent and noncovalent bonded SWNT–LSZ
as well as SWNT and native LSZ.

FTIR provided insights into the effects of SWNT attachment on LSZ.
Comparing the position, relative intensity, and shape of a protein’s
amide I and amide II bands are one of the key methods for identifying
protein–nanomaterial interactions and protein conformational
changes.8 The amide I band is primarily
due to C=O stretching of the peptide, while the amide II peak
is primarily due to C–N stretching as well as N–H bending. Figure 1b shows FTIR spectra
of the covalent and noncovalent LSZ–SWNT supernatants and LSZ
prepared by an equivalent method without the addition of SWNT. For
the pure LSZ dispersion, the amide I band was symmetric, centered
at 1651 cm–1, and had approximately twice the intensity
as the symmetric amide II band centered at 1533 cm–1. In the case of noncovalent SWNT functionalization, the amide I
band was similar to that for pure LSZ, centered at 1650 cm–1. This indicates that interaction with the SWNT had little effect
on the LSZ backbone’s secondary structure.21 However, the amide I band for the noncovalently functionalized
LSZ–SWNT had nearly four times the intensity of the amide II
band and was significantly downshifted to 1526 cm–1. Furthermore, the increased intensity of the amide III bands (1200–1350
cm–1) indicates significant changes to LSZ’s
secondary and tertiary structures. It has been established in the
literature that sonication of aqueous LSZ–SWNT dispersions
results in the simultaneous debundling of SWNT and partial unfolding
of LSZ; this exposes the tryptophan residue, which then experiences
π–π interactions with SWNT.1,2,8,12 Cessation
of sonication results in the refolding of LSZ, but the presence of
the SWNT inhibits restoration of the original conformation. In contrast,
covalent functionalization through EDC–NHS chemistry resulted
in a similar amide I to amide II intensity ratio and amide III peaks
as the pure LSZ. However, the covalent functionalization resulted
in a greater downshift in the amide I band to 1648 cm–1 suggesting more changes to the LSZ backbone, but less shift in the
amide II band, which was centered at 1531 cm–1.

In addition to determining the relative amounts of bound components,
thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) also provided insight into the thermal
stability resulting from the two functionalization methods. In an
inert argon atmosphere, Figure 2a, the thermal stabilities of both covalent and noncovalent
LSZ–SWNT are similar until 560 °C. After 560 °C,
the difference in thermal stability is due to oxidation and subsequent
covalent functionalization causing a loss in the thermal stability
of the SWNT. The TGA curves in the air atmosphere, Figure 2b, show higher thermal stability
for the covalent sample and lower thermal stability for the noncovalent
sample compared to both the SWNT and LSZ curves. It can be inferred
that covalent functionalization has some stabilization effect on the
LSZ, while the slight denaturation of LSZ during sonication was most
likely the cause of lowered thermal stability of the noncovalent LSZ–SWNT
sample.

Comparison of Dispersion Antimicrobial Activity
The
effects of the type of functionalization on the LSZ’s antimicrobial
activity were compared using the standard assay recommended by the
supplier;22 this method was chosen for
consistency with the previous work.8,16,17,23 This UV–vis
spectroscopy method is based on changes in turbidity resulting from
the lysis of Micrococcus lysodeikticus, measured at 450 nm and normalized by the initial absorbance 1  where ΔAbs450 is the change
in the 450 nm absorbance intensity, t is the test
duration, mLSZ is the mass of LSZ, and
the test or blank indicates the dispersion or buffer solution. Only
supernatants were used in these assays so that only individual or
small bundles of SWNT were present. Since the goal of the research
was to compare the results of the two functionalization methods, no
efforts were made to remove free lysozyme from the noncovalent supernatants.
As shown in Figure 3, the native LSZ showed an immediate decrease in absorbance that
initially followed the Michaelis–Menten kinetics, and then
plateaued after approximately 5 min. Similar behavior was exhibited
by the noncovalent LSZ–SWNT, but the initial activity (decrease
in absorbance) was more significant, and after 5 min, the data became
scattered due to the formation of SWNT flocs, which intermittently
obscured the optical path. In contrast, covalent SWNT–LSZ showed
a continuous, nearly linear decrease in absorbance throughout the
measurement time. The 80% maintained activity of noncovalent LSZ–SWNT
is in agreement with the results of Horn et al.8

Figure 3 Turbidimetric assay of dispersions as well as a table showing initial
cell death slope, specific activity, and percentage of native LSZ
activity maintained for each dispersion.

The linear cell death slope or initial rates of lysis activity
of the SWNT–LSZ and LSZ dispersions are shown in Figure 3. They were obtained by finding
the natural logarithm of the first 0.5 min in the initial linear region
of the native LSZ and SWNT–LSZ dispersions and obtaining the
corresponding slopes.17 The noncovalent
SWNT–LSZ had a higher activity rate of 0.93 min–1 compared to the native LSZ rate of 0.57 min–1.
Covalently bound SWNT–LSZ had a much lower rate of 0.014 min–1, but retained its activity over a much longer period.
This combined with the absence of flocculation over the assay period
suggests stabilization of the SWNT dispersion state by covalent LSZ
functionalization. However, in contrast to investigations by Merli
et al. of covalent LSZ-MWNT functionalization, the data do not indicate
that the presence of the SWNT increased LSZ activity based on active
units/mg of LSZ.19 This could be because
Merli et al. considered CFU counts and not initial kinetics, differences
in LSZ conformation due to the different nanotube diameters, or differences
in nanotube surface chemistry.

Comparison of LSZ–SWNT–PVA
Composite Film Properties
Nyankima et al.17 showed that transparent
and mechanically robust antimicrobial cast films could be made from
combining of LSZ–SWNT dispersions with a PVA solution. Their
work demonstrated that casting films from supernatant dispersions
resulted in greater transparency, antimicrobial activity, and mechanical
properties than casting films from the initial mixtures, which contained
bundles and aggregates. However, their work did not explore the effects
of covalent functionalization. Figure 4 shows assays performed with SWNT–LSZ–PVA,
as well as control LSZ–PVA and PVA films. The PVA-only film
showed some decreased absorbance; this was possibly due to some cellular
aggregation from depletion attraction caused by the dissolution of
PVA.24 For each functionalization type,
both the film and dispersion assays exhibited similar LSZ activity
retention. The LSZ–PVA film showed higher activity than any
of the SWNT–LSZ–PVA films. The noncovalent and covalent
films both showed comparable specific activity to the dispersions
81 and 63% for the films, respectively, versus 80 and 66% for the
dispersions, respectively. However, a significant observation was
made over the course of the assays that the noncovalent films were
more resistant to dissolution over the assay period; they remained
intact, while the LSZ, PVA, and covalent LSZ–SWNT films dissolved
completely.

Figure 4 Turbidimetric assays with films prepared with PVA as well as a
table showing initial cell death slope, specific activity, and percentage
of LSZ activity maintained for each film.

Finally, as shown in Figure 5 and Table 2, tensile testing showed that dry LSZ–SWNT films had significantly
higher Young’s moduli than PVA and LSZ–PVA films. The
noncovalent LSZ–SWNT–PVA films also had significantly
higher yield and tensile strengths; these results are similar to those
obtained by Nyankima et al.17 The noncovalent
films’ Young’s modulus, yield strength, and tensile
strength were approximately 1.5 times higher than the covalent films.
The covalent LSZ–SWNT–PVA films had similar yield and
tensile strengths to the control films; this may be due to the lower
concentration of SWNT. Interestingly, the toughness values were similar
for all films.

Conclusions
There has been growing interest in stable carbon
nanotube conjugates
with functional biomaterials such as enzymes or biomarkers. The antibacterial
enzyme, lysozyme, has been the focus of much attention because of
its intrinsic antimicrobial properties and commercial availability.
Favorable π–π interactions between SWNT and LSZ’s
tryptophan residue enable facile noncovalent functionalization. In
addition, covalent attachment can be readily achieved using EDC–NHS,
a standard biochemical functionalization scheme. This work compared
the properties of dispersions and films resulting from each of these
approaches. Each method resulted in different relative concentrations;
this, combined with the different nature of attachment, affected both
dispersion and film properties. Covalent functionalization led to
improved dispersion stability and longer duration of bacterial lysis
relative to noncovalent LSZ–SWNT. Films prepared with LSZ–SWNT
dispersions maintained similar LSZ activity to their dispersions.
The presence of SWNT significantly increased films’ Young modulus,
but only the noncovalent films had significantly greater yield and
tensile strengths. In addition, only the noncovalently functionalized
films had significant hydrolytic stability during immersion in an
aqueous solution. More research is needed to determine if this was
solely due to the relative concentrations resulting from the two methods
or if the nature of attachment also played a significant role. The
results of this research show that both the noncovalent and covalent
functionalization methods have merit. The choice of the method and
composite concentrations should be based on the relative importance
of dispersion stability, dispersion activity duration, hydrolytic
stability, and film mechanical properties.

Materials and Methods
The SWNT used in this study was CG200 (Lot # 14) obtained from
Southwest Nano Technologies Inc (now CHASM, Norman, OK). SWNT composition
determined by TGA showed 93% carbon content (85% pure SWNT; the rest
was the catalyst). Lyophilized lysozyme from chicken egg white (Lot
# 061M1329V) was purchased as a powder from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis,
MO). PVA was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich with an average molecular
weight of 195 000 g/mol and used as received.

Noncovalent
dispersions were prepared by mixing 0.5 wt % lysozyme
with deionized (DI) water for 5 min. Then, 0.1 wt % SWNT was added.
The resulting dispersion was tip-sonicated for 30 min in an ice bath
with pulses set to 5 s on 2 s off at 60% amplitude. Covalent attachment
of lysozyme onto SWNT was performed using the procedure described
by Merli et al. for LSZ attachment to MWNT.19 In short, SWNT were acid oxidized in a 3:1 v/v sulfuric acid to
the nitric acid mixture followed by thorough DI water rinsing. Carbodiimide
activation of the carboxylic group was achieved in the presence of N-ethyl-N-(3-dimethylamino-propyl) carbodiimide
hydrochloride (EDC) and N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS),
both purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. The resulting samples were rinsed
thoroughly with 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid
(MES) buffer (50 mM, pH 6.2). An LSZ solution (10 mg/mL, 10 mM phosphate
buffer, pH 8) was then added to the activated and rinsed SWNT. This
was tip-sonicated for 1 min and then allowed to react overnight on
an orbital mixer. The mixture was washed to remove excess LSZ, lyophilized,
and ground into a powder. The powder was added to water to achieve
a concentration of 1 wt % powder and tip-sonicated for 30 min in an
ice bath with pulses set to 5 s on 2 s off at 60% amplitude.

For both the noncovalent and covalent methods, the initial mixtures
and the supernatants obtained after centrifugation were characterized.
To determine if free (unbound) lysozyme was present, each type of
sample was rinsed with successive 100 mL washes under vacuum filtration
until no LSZ was detectable by UV–vis. The mixtures were centrifuged
at 17 000g for 3 h to remove bundles, and
the supernatants were characterized and retained. The supernatants
were used for the antimicrobial assays and preparation of poly(vinyl
alcohol) nanocomposite films.

Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA)
was performed on TA Instruments
Q5000 and Q50 TGAs to find the amounts of LSZ and SWNT present. FTIR
was performed on the covalent and noncovalent supernatants, SWNT (as
received) and native LSZ with a Nicolet FTIR instrument using attenuated
total reflectance (ATR) with a germanium crystal. Raman spectra were
obtained using a Renishaw inVia Raman microscope (Hoffman Estates,
IL) with 514 and 785 nm lasers to characterize the degree of functionalization
of the SWNT. The concentrations in the supernatant were determined
by UV–vis spectroscopy and TGA. The amount of bound LSZ in
the noncovalent dispersions was determined by successive washes with
DI water and then using a combination of UV–vis spectroscopy
to determine free LSZ concentration in the filtrate and a mass balance
to determine the bound LSZ concentration, based on previously reported
methods.8,16,17

A Thermo
Scientific NanoDrop 2000c UV–vis spectrophotometer
was used to determine LSZ and SWNT concentrations based on Beer–Lambert
plots obtained at 280 and 660 nm, respectively. UV–vis was
also used to measure LSZ activity based on the time-dependent decrease
in turbidity on bacterial lysis of M. lysodeikticus (Sigma-Aldrich) in accordance with the method of Shugar et al.22,25 A 0.015% w/v M. lysodeikticus (Sigma-Aldrich)
bacterial suspension was prepared in a 66 mM potassium phosphate monobasic
buffer (pH 6.24 adjusted by 1 M potassium hydroxide). A 10 mm path
length quartz cuvette with 2.5 mL of the bacterial and 0.1 mL of sample
dispersion or the diluted sample was subjected to a kinetic scan for
25 min at 450 nm. Normalized absorbances were obtained by dividing
all data points by the initial absorbance. The concentration of dispersions
was also obtained by a combination of UV–vis calibration curves
and thermogravimetric analysis.

SWNT–LSZ–PVA films
were prepared by adding a 5 wt
% PVA solution to the dispersion to obtain 1.1 wt % PVA in each dispersion.
10 mL of SWNT–LSZ–PVA was placed in a 50 mm diameter
glass dish and allowed to evaporate on an orbital shaker overnight
to obtain a thin film. Assays were performed by the procedure stated
above, adjusting the time to 30 min and placing a sample of the film
with 50 mm2 surface area into the bacterial suspension
in place of dispersion. Tensile testing was performed with a 3 mm
× 15 mm film sample on an Instron model 5500 with a 100 N load
cell and with a crosshead speed of 1 mm/min.
