Diabetes
mellitus is the most common endocrine disease worldwide;
hyperglycemia is a hallmark of this disease. To alleviate the pain
caused by diabetes, developing and utilizing effective diabetic drugs
to maintain or recover the function of the residual β-cells
is an attractive therapeutic approach. γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)
has been shown to have such effects, but it is easy to have reduced
GABA activity under physiological conditions. In the present study,
GABA–chitosan nanoparticles (GABA–CS NPs) were prepared,
and glucose homeostasis, pancreatic β-cell protection, and anti-inflammatory
effects of GABA–CS NPs were investigated in vivo. The results
showed that blood glucose levels and IL-1β levels in the GABA–CS
NP-administered group were both significantly lower, whereas the PDX1
expression was significantly higher than that of the impaired group
(p < 0.01). This indicates that GABA–CS
NPs can efficiently maintain glucose homeostasis, protect β-cells,
and inhibit inflammation. These nanoparticles have the potential to
be applied for future diabetes theranostics.

Introduction
Diabetes mellitus (DM) is the most common
endocrine disease worldwide.
The International Diabetes Foundation predicted that, by the end of
2015, diabetes will have caused five million deaths and will have
cost between USD 673 billion and USD 1197 billion in healthcare spending.
If this rise is not halted, by 2040, there will be 642 million people
living with the disease.1 China has a high
prevalence of people with diabetes.2 Both
type 1 DM (T1DM) and type 2 DM (T2DM) are characterized by hyperglycemia;
this symptom primarily results from β-cell loss, though the
importance of insulin resistance and β-cell dysfunction remains
debated in T2DM.3,4 In T1DM, more than 70% of the
β-cells are destroyed,5 whereas in
T2DM, ∼40–60% of the β-cells are destroyed when
T2DM is diagnosed.6 The residual β-cells
are overloaded by increased insulin secretion, which accelerates their
apoptosis. Therefore, developing and utilizing effective diabetic
drugs to maintain or recover the function of the residual β-cells
is an attractive approach for diabetes therapeutics.

Recently,
γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) has garnered the interest
of researchers as it can affect most neuronal activities and is the
predominant neurotransmitter in the central nervous system (CNS).7 It is also present in the peripheral organs;
the pancreas has the highest concentration of GABA among the peripheral
organs, comparable to that in the CNS.8 Studies have demonstrated that GABA has the effect of regulating
glucagon release on α-cells9 and
insulin release on β-cells.10 In
addition, Soltani et al. reported that GABA exerted protective and
regenerative effects on murine pancreatic β-cells.11 Purwana et al. revealed the same effect on human
β-cells.10 Most recently, Ben-Othman
et al. reported that long-term GABA administration could induce alpha
cell-mediated β-like cell neogenesis.12 Further, researchers have also shown that GABA can inhibit inflammation13 and immune responses,14,15 both of which occur in T1DM and T2DM.16

Thus, we tried to control glucose homeostasis using GABA.
In consideration
of the instability of the drug under physiological conditions, chitosan
nanoparticles (CS NPs) were used as a drug carrier to protect and
control the release of GABA. CS NPs have the advantage of controlled
drug release, which improves drug efficacy, solubility, and stability.17,18 As these particles are scaled by the nanometer, they are able to
pass through biological barriers in vivo.19 The final degradation products of the CS NPs in vivo are water and
dioxide, which have no adverse effects. In addition, Wu et al. reported
that the derivatives of chitosan (CS)-affected murine pancreatic islet
β-cell proliferation in vitro.20 In
this study, we examined the effect of GABA-loaded CS NPs on glucose
homeostasis and protection of pancreatic β-cells by administering
GABA–CS NP suspension to mice, followed by multiple low-dose
streptozotocin (STZ) injections intraperitoneally (i.p.). The anti-inflammatory
effects of GABA–CS NPs in vivo were also investigated.

Results
and Discussion
Morphological Characterization of CS NPs
The prepared
CS NPs were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), which
can be seen in Figure 1. As shown in Figure 1a, the nanoparticles were spherical with a smooth surface. The average
diameter was 50.4 ± 18.7 nm (seen in Figure 1b), which indicates that these nanoparticles
can be administered through intravenous injection in future applications.

and size distribution (b) of CS NPs.

Effect of GABA–CS NPs on Glucose Homeostasis
To determine
the effect of GABA–CS NPs on blood glucose maintenance,
blood glucose levels were measured via a tail vein. Fasting blood
glucose concentrations were measured every 2 days in ICR mice. GABA–CS
NPs (10 mg per mouse),21 GABA solution
(20 μmol per mouse),11 or saline
were intragastrically administered to mice on day 3 and day 5. All
groups, except for the normal group of mice, were challenged with
40 mg/kg STZ injected intraperitoneally over 4 consecutive days, from
day 4. Figure 2 shows
that the fasted blood glucose levels of the GABA–CS NP group
and the GABA group were both significantly lower than that of the
impaired group, after the STZ challenge test. At day 8, the impaired
group had reached the diagnostic standard of diabetes, with a blood
glucose concentration of 12.80 ± 1.08 mmol/L, whereas the concentrations
were 8.40 ± 0.64 and 9.70 ± 1.56 mmol/L for the GABA–CS
NP and GABA groups, respectively, both below 10 mmol/L. The levels
were significantly lower on day 8 and very significantly lower on
day 10, compared with those of the impaired group.

Figure 2 Effect of GABA–CS
NPs on fasting blood glucose in ICR mice
(*p < 0.05, **p < 0.01).

Usually, body blood glucose levels
should remain in a narrow range.
The most important part is hormone regulation, in which insulin secreted
by the β-cells and glucagon produced by the α-cells play
the role of reducing and elevating the blood glucose level, respectively.
Here, the STZ treatment of 40 mg/kg per day for 4 consecutive days
was designed to simulate pancreatic β-cell injury due to various
factors in daily life. Our results indicate that GABA–CS NP-administered
mice could maintain better blood glucose control than the mice administered
GABA solution alone.

Effect of GABA–CS NPs on Insulin Secretion
To
further examine the effect of GABA–CS NPs on the pancreatic
β-cell function, the insulin secretion ability was investigated.
As can be seen in Figure 3, on day 14, after multiple low-dose STZ injections intraperitoneally,
the serum insulin concentration of the GABA–CS NP group was
57.47 ± 4.08 ng/mL, which was higher than those of the GABA group
(46.80 ± 6.83 ng/mL) and the impaired group (47.33 ± 7.21
ng/mL). This indicates that the GABA–CS NP group could maintain
serum insulin levels to some extent. While for the GABA and impaired
groups, the serum insulin concentrations were similar, indicating
that using the drug alone could not stimulate pancreatic β-cells
for such a long period because of the instability of GABA under physiological
conditions.

Figure 3 Effect of GABA–CS NPs on serum insulin concentration in
ICR mice (*p < 0.05, **p <
0.01).

Effect of GABA–CS
NPs on β-Cell Protection
To determine whether GABA–CS
NPs can protect β-cells,
PDX1 was tested qualitatively and quantitatively by immunofluorescence
staining (Figure 4)
and immunoblotting (Figure 5), respectively. Though PDX1 is responsible for the pancreatic
development, rather than directly for the β-cell development,
the PDX1 results can show the difference of the β cell activity
by comparing the experimental groups with the normal and impaired
groups. As can be seen in Figure 4, there was more PDX1 expression in the pancreas sections
of the GABA–CS NP-administered mice than those of the GABA
group and impaired group. This indicates that the existence of the
nanoparticles exhibited protection efficacy to β-cells, to maintain
their activity. Figure 5 further shows that the relative intensity of the GABA–CS
NP group was 0.95 ± 0.15, compared with 0.38 ± 0.21 of the
impaired group, using western blotting analysis. This indicates that
the expression of PDX1 in the GABA–CS NP-administered mice
was significantly more than that of the impaired group. This result
is in accordance with the result obtained in Figure 4.

group, and (D) normal group).

Figure 5 Effect of GABA–CS NPs on PDX1 expression in ICR mice (western
blotting analysis was performed on the pancreas of mice at day 14.
*p < 0.05, **p < 0.01).

Combining all of the results above,
the preadministration of GABA–CS
NPs on day 3 and day 5 significantly diminished the β-cell depletion
induced by STZ. As known, both T1DM and T2DM are characterized by
β-cell deficiency, whereas the maintenance of β-cell mass
is a dynamic process, undergoing both increases and decreases through
β-cell renewal and apoptosis.11 Although
β-cells were considered as a quiescent cell type which lost
most of their proliferate capacity during adulthood,22,23 β-cells are impaired by subtotal pancreatectomy,24 inflammation,25 and
some hormones or small molecules10,26,27 that can trigger the proliferation process. On the
other hand, the prevention of β-cell apoptosis is also of benefit
for β-cell maintenance. For example, the small molecule GABA11 and the carrier material CS,20 both have a proliferative effect on β-cells. In addition,
the damage associated with STZ may trigger the proliferation process
of β-cells. Although STZ cannot pass through the cell membranes,
it can be transported through GLUT2, which is specifically expressed
in β-cells. STZ accumulated inside the β-cells fragments
the DNA by alkylation and thus triggers the DNA repair mechanism,
resulting in cellular energy depletion and ultimately β-cell
necrosis.28 GABA protects β-cells
from apoptosis by increasing the DNA synthesis,11 which may compensate for the damage from STZ.

Effect of GABA–CS
NPs on the Inflammatory Factor
Finally, the serum level of
the inflammatory factor IL-1β after
12 days was measured to assess whether the GABA–CS NPs had
an effect on inflammation (Figure 6). The IL-1β levels were 92.91 ± 4.70 and
87.62 ± 7.93 pg/mL for the GABA–CS NP group and GABA group,
respectively, which was similar to that of the normal group (95.13
± 9.89 pg/mL) and significantly below that of the impaired group
(118.80 ± 14.67 pg/mL). Thus, it can be seen that GABA–CS
NPs and GABA inhibit inflammation, which would be beneficial for the
recovery of β-cells in diabetes treatment. Soltani et al. also
showed the inflammation suppressing effects of GABA on β-cells,
where the inflammatory factors, including IL-1β, TNF-α,
and INF-γ levels, were decreased.11 As both T1DM and T2DM are associated with inflammation, the anti-inflammatory
effect is essential for β-cell protection.

NPs on IL-1β levels in ICR mice

Conclusion
Maintaining
the function of β-cells is an important issue
in diabetes therapy. In our opinion, both protection and inhibition
of inflammation should be addressed. This study indicates that the
administration of GABA–CS NPs can significantly maintain glucose
homeostasis by protecting the pancreatic β-cells. At the same
time, IL-1β was also reduced by the administration of GABA–CS
NPs, which is in accordance with an inhibiting effect on inflammation.
Therefore, we anticipate that the GABA–CS NPs could be applied
for future diabetes theranostics to improve the activity of pancreatic
β-cells and alleviate the inflammation and immune responses
caused by diabetes. This carrier system is simple but efficient and
is easy to implement in future with intravenous injection.

Materials
and Methods
Chemicals
Biochemicals, including GABA, sodium triphosphate
(TPP), and STZ were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Co. LLC, USA. CS
was purchased from Aladdin Industrial Co. Ltd., Shanghai. Rabbit antibody
PDX1 and β-actin were provided by Cell Signaling Technology
Inc., USA, and Bioworld Technology Inc., USA, respectively. Rat anti-insulin
antibody and goat antirat IgG conjugated with NL493 were obtained
from R&D Systems Inc., USA. 4′,6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole
(DAPI) was purchased from Solarbio Co., Beijing, China. An insulin
ELISA kit was purchased from Millipore KGa, Deutschland. The IL-1β
ELISA kit was provided by Excell Biology, Shanghai, China. The poly(vinylidene
difluoride) (PVDF) membrane was purchased from Genscript Co., Nanjing,
China. Other immunoblotting-related chemicals, including a bicinchoninic
acid (BCA) kit and goat antirabbit IgG conjugated with horseradish
peroxidase (HRP) were purchased from Beyotime Biotechnology, Shanghai,
China. All other reagents were of analytical grade and were purchased
locally.

Animals
Experiments were carried out on male ICR mice
of 25 ± 2 g body weight, purchased from SLAC Laboratory Co. Ltd.,
Shanghai. They were housed in separate cages under 12 h light and
12 h dark periods and were maintained on standard food pellets and
water ad libitum. All animal care and procedures were performed in
accordance with the published guidelines of the China Council on Animal
Care (Regulations for the Administration of Affairs Concerning Experimental
Animals, approved by the State Council on 31 October, 1988 and promulgated
by Decree no. 2 of the State Science and Technology Commission on
14 November, 1988). All efforts were made to minimize the number of
animals used and their suffering. ICR mice were divided
into four experimental groups: administration of GABA–CS NPs
(GABA–CS NPs), administration of GABA (GABA), the impaired
group with STZ induction, and the normal group. STZ induction was
executed by intraperitoneal injection with 40 mg/kg STZ solution over
4 consecutive days. The normal group was not treated with STZ. Each
group consisted of eight animals.

Preparation of GABA–CS
NPs
GABA-loaded CS NPs
were prepared according to the method described by Shilpa et al. with modifications.21 Briefly,
CS was dissolved in 1% acetic acid to obtain a concentration of 1
mg/mL. CS nanoparticles were precipitated from 60 mL CS solution under
rapid stirring, with the addition of 30 mL of 1 mg/mL TPP solution.
To load GABA to CS, 20 μg of GABA was dissolved in CS solution,
and the nanoparticles were precipitated by the addition of TPP solution
droplets, making the final concentration as 20 μg/mL CS solution.
The precipitated nanoparticles were centrifuged for 10 min at 10 000
rpm. The pellet was washed thoroughly with ultrapure water three times
and then resuspended in ultrapure water again, followed by ultrasonic
dispersion. CS–GABA powder was obtained by lyophilization 48
h after freezing at −20 °C overnight. The prepared CS
NPs were characterized by SEM (S-4800, Hitachi Ltd., Japan) and further
analyzed by the software Nanomeasure to determine the size distribution.

Insulin and Inflammatory Factor Detection
Blood samples
(∼1 mL) were obtained by the removal of an eyeball in fasted
mice on day 14, and the serum was collected and stored at −20
°C. Serum insulin and IL-1β concentrations were measured
using ELISA kits.

Immunofluorescence Staining
The
isolated pancreas was
fixed overnight in 4% formaldehyde solution. Following dehydration
in ethanol and clearing with xylene, the pancreas was embedded in
paraffin. Pancreatic sections (5 μm) were incubated with rat
anti-insulin (1:1000) and DAPI. Insulin was detected with fluorescent
NL493-conjugated IgG.

Immunoblotting
The immunoblotting
was performed according
to the previous method with modifications.29 The isolated pancreas was homogenized in a lysis buffer and incubated
on ice for 10 min. The homogenates were centrifuged at 12 000
rpm for 5 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were then collected.
The protein concentration was determined by a BCA assay. The proteins
were separated using SDS-PAGE and were then transferred to a PVDF
membrane. Following blocking in a 5% BSA/TBST solution at room temperature
for 1 h, the membranes were incubated with the appropriate primary
antibodies at 4 °C overnight (anti-PDX1, 1:1000; anti-insulin,
1:1000; and anti-β-actin, 3000). After washing three times with
TBST, the membranes were incubated with an HRP-labeled secondary antibody
(1:1000). The blots were washed three times again with TBST, and the
immune-reactive bands were detected using an enhanced chemilluminescence
method. The results were normalized to the protein expression level
of β-actin in each sample.

Statistics
All
data were analyzed using SPSS software
22.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, USA) and expressed as the mean ± SD.
Statistical evaluations were performed with analysis of variance (ANOVA).
Student–Newman–Keuls tests were used to compare different
groups after ANOVA. A p value less than 0.05 was
considered to be statistically significant.
