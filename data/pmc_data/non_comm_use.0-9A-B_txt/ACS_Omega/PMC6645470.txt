A one-pot,
multicomponent strategy was used to synthesize the first
example of the dirhenium carbonyl coordination complex 2, in which the two metal atoms are connected through a chiral helical-shaped
diphosphine oxide. Thanks to the flexibility of the helix of helicene 1, complex 2 was isolated in quite a good yield
as a stable compound. It was characterized by analytical and spectroscopic
techniques as well as by single-crystal X-ray analysis, which confirmed
the chemical structure and the peculiar architecture of 2. In addition, computational studies were in agreement with the transitions
observed in the experimental UV–vis spectrum, revealing the
presence of two bands with maxima at about 520 (metal-to-ligand charge
transfer) and 400 nm (IL).

Introduction
The
helicene-based transition metal complexes are an extremely
appealing class of chiral molecules, in which the coordination of
metals to π-helical ligand bearing appropriate coordinating
functionalities allows the construction of uncommon chiral architectures.1 Indeed, helicenes are ortho-annulated
polycyclic aromatic compounds endowed with an inherently chiral π-conjugated
system which have attracted considerable attention because of their
unique physicochemical properties and potential applications in different
areas of science.2−4 On the other hand, reacting π-helicene scaffolds
with metals can significantly modify specific properties, obtaining
a structural variety that however retains the defining features of
the helical structure. In this context, tetrathia[7]helicenes (7-TH),
in which the thiophene rings are fused to alternating benzene rings
to form a configurationally stable helix, are emerging as the most
promising systems,5 also thanks to the
reliable functionalization of the terminal thiophene rings of the
7-TH scaffold6−10 that allows the introduction of a diversity of functional groups,
including those with an efficient coordinating ability (e.g., cyano11 and phosphane8,12). Thus, the
7-TH nitrile derivatives were used as monodentate ligands in the synthesis
of the corresponding Ru(II) and Fe(II) complexes11 that have been shown to be interesting candidates for optoelectronic
purposes. More recently, Rh(I) and Au(I) complexes based on 7-TH phosphanes8,12 or phosphathiahelicenes13,14 have been successfully
employed in the asymmetric organometallic catalysis. It should be
noted that the unique flexibility of the 7-TH skeleton ensures the
coordination with different metal centers, affording chelated Rh(I)
complexes8 or dinuclear Au(I) complexes12 formed through the coordination of two phosphorus
atoms of 7-TH diphosphanes to a rhodium center or two gold centers,
respectively. Among several helicene-based coordination complexes
reported so far, only one rhenium complex has been described in the
literature.15 Moreover, enantiopure chiral
rhenium complexes are very scarce, and some of them are chiral at
the rhenium center,16−21 whereas in other cases, a chiral ligand is present.15,22−26 The synthesis of some of these complexes is based on metal-direct
self-assembly, which affords supramolecular coordination complexes,
whose functionalities such as enantioselective recognition, catalysis,
and sensing are improved with respect to the organic counterpart.27 In this framework, the assembly of fac-Re(CO)3 units with oxygen anionic donors, or chalcogenide
anions, and neutral bridging nitrogen ligand through the direct orthogonal
bonding approach represents an example of the synthesis of rhenium-based
supramolecular coordination complexes.28−31 This one-pot multicomponent approach
has also been used for the synthesis of dinuclear rhenium complexes
containing the hard ditopic O=P donors as the bridging ligand.32−35 However, the rhenium-based polynuclear complexes containing O=P
ligands are very scarce, based on tetraphenyldichalcogenoimidodiphosphinate
anions as ligands,34,35 and, more recently, flexible
alkyl or benzyl diphosphine oxides as neutral ditopic O=P ligands
along with a rigid bischelating O donor (e.g., chloranilic acid and
2,5-dihydroxy-1,4-benzoquinone).32,33 In our continuing
studies on the synthesis and characterization of organometallic complexes
based on the 7-TH derivatives, we focused on the study of the coordination
ability of an uncommon and more rigid helical-based phosphine oxide
as a neutral ditopic ligand toward dinuclear rhenium complexes containing
chloranilic acid as the anionic donor. Herein, we report the first
example of a rhenium(I)-based coordination complex in which 7-TH phosphine
oxide (±)-1,9 used as
a racemic mixture for this first study, has been selected as a model
helical bis(P=O) donor ligand.

Results and Discussion
The dinuclear rhenium(I) complex 2 was synthesized
by refluxing Re2(CO)10, the racemic mixture
of the π-helical phosphine oxide (±)-1, and
chloranilic acid (H2-CA), as anionic donor, in mesitylene
for 24 h (Scheme 1).

Scheme 1 Synthesis of Dinuclear Rhenium(I) Complex 2
This one-pot procedure involves
the oxidative addition of the chloranilate
anion to [Re2(CO)10], with the reduction of
H+ to H2, and dissociation of one CO ligand
for each metal center. Then, the further substitution of other two
CO groups by the bridging phosphine-oxide ligand 1 affords
complex 2. Chromatographic purification of the reaction
mixture provided complex 2 in a 79% yield as an air-stable
brown-red solid. It is important to note that 7-TH are known to be
configurationally stable heterohelicenes, with a racemization barrier,
for example, for the unsubstituted 7-TH of 38.7 kcal/mol at 227 °C.36 Because the temperature of the reaction used
for the synthesis of complex 2 is quite lower, this could
open the possibility to synthesize the optically active rhenium complex 2, starting from the corresponding enantiopure phosphine oxide 1. In fact, the racemization barrier of ligand 1 should be significantly higher than that of the unsubstituted 7-TH
because of the presence of two bulky diphenylphosphine oxide groups
on the two terminal thienyl rings.

Contrary to other dinuclear
rhenium complexes reported by some
of us,37 complex 2 displayed,
in the (CO) region of the infrared (IR) spectrum, only three bands
at 2020, 1912, and 1905 cm–1 instead of the typical
four-band pattern. This feature has been already observed for the
analogous complexes containing the same chloranilate anion as the
ancillary ligand,32,33 in agreement with the modulation
of the position of the carbonyl stretching bands by the nature of
the ancillary ligand. The 31P{1H} NMR spectrum
of 2 (Figure S3 in the Supporting Information) shows only one singlet at δ +42.2 ppm, indicating
a symmetrical bridging coordination of 1. The symmetrical
and dinuclear structure of complex 2 was further confirmed
by X-ray analysis. Single crystals suitable for the X-ray structural
determination of 2 were obtained from the slow diffusion
of hexane into toluene solution of complex 2. An Oak
Ridge thermal ellipsoid plot (ORTEP) view of the complex is reported
in Figure 1.

of 2 with the atomic numbering scheme.
Ellipsoids are drawn at 20% probability.

In complex 2, the ditopic 7-TH phosphine oxide
ligand
coordinates two Re(I) cations through its O1 and O2 oxygen atoms.
The chloranilic (CA2–) unit acts as the bischelating
ancillary ligand bridging the Re cations through its O3, O4 and O5,
O6 oxygen atoms. The coordination geometry around each Re center is
completed by three CO ligands and can be described as distorted octahedron.

Although the atoms of the C2O2 basal plane
show very small tetrahedral distortion, the Re1–O1 and Re2–O2
bonds deviate significantly (by 12.1° and 15.2°, respectively)
from the normal to the C2O2 plane. Moreover,
the {[Re(CO)3](μ-CA)[Re(CO)3]} unit deviates
from planarity toward a boatlike conformation, with Re1 and Re2 placed
at 0.18(1) and 0.39(1) Å, respectively, from the least-squares
plane through the CA2– ligand. Such distortions
are to be related to the geometrical constraint imposed by the 7-TH
ligand, as confirmed by comparison with the analogous dinuclear Re(I)
complexes bearing the O=P(CH2)nP=O (n = 332 and 433) ditopic ligands in place of 1. The distance between the Re cations observed in 2, 8.059(11) Å, is slightly shorter than that reported for the
complex with the butyl bridge, 8.08 Å,33 but significantly longer than that of the complex with the propyl
bridge, 7.84 Å.32 Although in the
former complex the {[Re(CO)3](μ-CA)[Re(CO)3]} unit is almost planar, in the latter, it assumes a boatlike conformation
similar to that observed in 2 but with the Re ions further
away from the CA2– plane. On the other side, the
7-TH ligand is as well expected to undergo a slight distortion after
coordination to the metal centers. This is supported by the comparison
of the P1···P2 distance in 2, 6.609(6)
Å, with that of the previously reported 7-TH phosphonate derivative
bearing two EtO groups at the phosphorous atoms in place of the two
phenyl groups,8 measuring 5.879 Å.
These results further demonstrate the peculiar flexible nature of
the helical system of 7-TH.

The absorption spectra of complex 2 and of the 7-TH
ligand 1, recorded in a diluted, air-equilibrated dichloromethane
solution at room temperature, are shown in Figure 2.

Figure 2 UV–vis absorption spectra of the 7-TH
ligand 1 (the dashed line) and of the dinuclear complex 2 (the
continuous line) in air-equilibrated CH2Cl2 at
298 K.

The absorption spectrum of 2 shows two main absorption
features. The broad and structureless low-energy absorption band at
514 nm (ca. 1.25 × 104 M–1 cm–1) has been attributed to the metal-to-ligand d(Re)
→ π*(CA2–) charge-transfer transition (MLCT). Actually, both the energy
and the molar absorption coefficients closely resemble those reported
for analogous dinuclear rhenium complexes containing phosphine oxide
and the chloranilate anion as the ancillary ligand.32,33 The spectrum also shows another absorption band at a higher energy
(maximum in the range 390–409 nm), with a slightly higher intensity
(ε ca. 2.10 × 104 M–1 cm–1). This band is very similar to that observed for
the 7-TH ligand, and it has been attributed to the spin-allowed π–π*
excitations of the helicene skeleton. In comparison to the 7-TH ligand,
this band is only slightly red-shifted, confirming that this electronic
transition does not involve the metal centers. Moreover, it displays
a less pronounced vibronic structure. This feature could be attributed
to the less coplanar geometry adopted by the helicene ligand inside
the complex. The band assignment has been confirmed by time-dependent
density functional theory (TDDFT) calculations on the DFT optimized
complex. The computed spectrum of 2 in CH2Cl2 (see Figure S4 in the Supporting Information) well reproduces the observed one, revealing the
presence of two bands with maxima at about 520 and 400 nm. The former
is mainly due to the excitations at 527 nm (oscillator strength f = 0.52) and 480 nm (f = 0.16), corresponding
to the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) – 3–
lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) (82%) and HOMO –
6–LUMO (88%) transitions, respectively, where HOMO –
3 is delocalized on the {[Re(CO)3](μ-CA)[Re(CO)3]} moiety, HOMO – 6 mainly on the [Re(CO)3] units, and LUMO on the CA2– moiety. The band
at higher energy is determined by excitations at 412 (f = 0.22) and 396 nm (f = 0.30), mainly due to HOMO–LUMO
+ 1 (96%) and HOMO – 1–LUMO + 1 (90%), respectively,
where HOMO, HOMO – 1, and LUMO + 1 are all orbitals delocalized
on the 7-TH ligand (see Figure S5 in the Supporting Information for a plot of the molecular orbitals mainly involved
in the electronic transitions).

Conclusions
In
conclusion, we have described the synthesis of the first dinuclear
rhenium complex in which the two Re centers are connected by an unusual
helical diphosphine oxide. This peculiar coordination architecture
is possible thanks to the flexibility of the phosphorus-based helical
ligand that, also in this case, is able to exhibit different dihedral
angles of the helix depending on the steric demand of the surrounding
portion of the molecule. Having successfully demonstrated the formation
of complex 2, in view of the potential applications of
this procedure to synthesize the enantiopure rhenium complexes based
on the 7-TH phosphine oxides, some experiments could be performed
to assess the configurational stability of these chiral bis(P=O)
donor ligands.

Noteworthy, the spectroscopic characterization
of 2 points out a strong absorption maximum in the red
portion of the
visible spectrum, in line with that observed for the analogous complexes
previously reported. This means that the helical system does not perturb
the spectroscopic properties of the complex, and this could open the
way to investigate the photophysical and chiroptical properties of
the corresponding enantiopure complexes.

Single-Crystal
X-ray Diffraction Studies on Complex 2
Very
thin dark red single crystals of 2 suitable
for X-ray diffraction have been obtained by recrystallization from
toluene. Repeated recrystallization attempts did not allow to improve
the quality of the crystals, which was in all cases very poor. The
intensity data were collected on a Bruker Smart Apex CCD area detector
(Bruker AXS Inc., Madison, WI, US) using the graphite-monochromated
Mo Kα radiation (λ = 0.71073 Å). Data reduction was
made with SAINT, and the absorption corrections based on multiscan
were obtained by SADABS.38 The structure
was solved by SHELXS-9739 and refined on
F2 by full-matrix least-squares using SHELXL-14.40 Data collection was performed at low temperature (120 K)
to enhance the diffracted intensities and increase the extent of the
observed data. A quite low data/parameters ratio prevented to get
a meaningful description of the thermal parameters, and, for this
reason, several restraints (DELU and ISOR) have been applied on the
heavy atoms of the more disordered groups. Moreover, the large void
present in the crystal structure suggests the presence of disordered
cocrystallized solvent molecule(s), whose structure, however, could
not be determined owing to the low resolution of the X-ray data.

Hydrogen atoms were placed in the calculated positions and included
in the refinement as “riding”. The H isotropic thermal
parameters were fixed at 1.2 (1.5 for methyl groups) times the equivalent
thermal parameter of the atoms to which they are bonded. The program
ORTEPIII was used for graphics.41 The crystallographic
data were deposited with the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre
under the supplementary publication no. CCDC 1844855. These data can
be obtained free of charge via www.ccdc.cam.ac.uk/conts/retrieving.html (or from CCDC, 12 Union Road, Cambridge CB2 1EZ, UK; fax: +44-1223-336-033;

Theoretical
Studies
Geometry optimization of isolated,
gas-phase complex 2 was performed by the Gaussian16 program
package,42 using the def2-SVP43,44 basis set and the M06 functional,45 because
of its specific parametrization on organometallic complexes. Rhenium
has been treated as a 15-electron system, with relativistic effective
core potential taken from the literature.46 The X-ray molecular structure of 2 was used as the
starting point for geometry optimization. The electronic absorption
spectrum was computed in dichloromethane on the optimized structure
using the same basis set and the PBE0 functional,47 owing to its optimal performance in reproducing the absorption
spectra of organic48 and organometallic
compounds.49 Solvent effects (CH2Cl2) have been taken into account in all calculations
by the polarizable continuum model using the integral equation formalism
variant.50
