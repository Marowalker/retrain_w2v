Single
crystals of organically templated chiral bromobismuthates(III),
[((R/S)-C8H12N)4][Bi2Br10], have been grown for
the first time via a slow evaporation method. Each of the chiral molecular
compound consists of (R) or (S)-1-phenylethylammonium ([C8H12N]+) cations and [Bi2Br10]4– anions. Both the title compounds reveal thermal and moisture stabilities
up to ca. 220 °C and over 1 month, respectively. The newly prepared
Bi3+-based organic–inorganic hybrid materials show
optical band gap of ca. 2.88 eV. The noncentrosymmetric [((R)-C8H12N)4][Bi2Br10] and [((S)-C8H12N)4][Bi2Br10] exhibit second harmonic
generation efficiency of ca. 20 times that of α-SiO2 and are type I nonphase matchable. Uniformly deposited thin films
of [((R)-C8H12N)4][Bi2Br10] and [((S)-C8H12N)4][Bi2Br10] have been also successfully obtained by a simple spin-coating method.
The circular dichroism spectra for both reported thin films are symmetrical,
attributable to the corresponding Cotton effect. The selectively deposited
chiral thin films are expected to be used as a useful platform for
various surface reactions and interface engineering.

Introduction
Recently, organic–inorganic
hybrid materials (OIHMs) have
gained immense interest owing to the remarkable optoelectronic properties1,2 and their numerous applications in light-emitting diodes,3−5 photodetectors,6−8 photocatalysts,9−11 transistors,12 nanowire lasers,13−15 and photovoltaic devices.16−19 The technologically important applications mainly originate from
the materials’ excellent physical properties such as intense
light absorption, weakly bound charge-transfer excitons, and long
charge diffusion lengths.20−22 For example, methylammonium lead
halides-based hybrid perovskite solar cells with a high power conversion
efficiency of 22.1% have drawn remarkable attention as next-generation
photovoltaics.23 Chiral lead halides synthesized
with chiral amines with perovskite-like materials have also exhibited
interesting optoelectronic applications including photoluminescence
and ferroelectricity.24,25 Unfortunately, however, lead
in the hybrid perovskites is highly toxic and has an adverse environmental
impact. Therefore, hybrid perovskites containing less toxic and relatively
harmless metal cations have been sought extensively. Among many, Bi3+-based OIHMs have been considered as good replacements of
conventional Pb2+-based absorbers due to their lower toxicity.26 In addition, similar interesting materials’
properties arising from the trivalent Bi3+ cations containing
the same 6s2 lone pair electrons as those in the divalent
Pb2+ cations are expected from Bi3+-based OIHMs.
A highly air-stable methylammonium bismuth iodide, [(CH3NH3)3][Bi2I9], has been
recently reported as a promising constituent of lead-free solar cell
absorbers.27 Hybrid compounds consisting
of halobismuthates(III) and various organic molecules are in fact
of great interest due to their additional optical and electronic properties
such as nonlinear optical (NLO) behavior,28−33 photoluminescence,30,34 and ferroelectricity.35,36 In particular, second harmonic generation (SHG), which is one of
the second-order NLO properties, enables the application of optical
switches, frequency doubling, and optical data storage devices.37 However, the interesting characteristics are
only expected when the materials crystallize in macroscopic noncentrosymmetric
(NCS) structures.38 Although quite a lot
of OIHMs have been discovered thus far, most of the crystalline materials
exhibit centrosymmetric (CS) structures. To induce overall NCS structures
of OIHMs more effectively, we have introduced chiral organic cations
as structure-directing agents during the synthesis stage, where a
facile formation of asymmetric anion backbones and the subsequent
tunable optical and electronic properties could be anticipated. By
doing so, we were able to successfully synthesize two novel 1-phenylethylammonium
bromobismuthates(III), (R)/(S)-[C8H12N]4[Bi2Br10]. We also successfully fabricated the chiral OIHMs as thin films
on glass substrates by a simple spin-coating method and investigated
their optical properties through solid-state CD spectroscopy. The
uniformly deposited chiral thin films indeed suggest applicability
of the materials to the optoelectronic devices. Herein, we present
the synthesis, crystal structures, elemental analysis, thermal and
moisture stability, and a variety of bulk and thin film characteristics
of novel chiral Bi-based OIHMs.

Result and Discussion
Structures
Yellow large plate crystals of (R)-1 and (S)-1 have
been grown in high yields (86.2%) through a slow evaporation method.
Single-crystal X-ray diffraction (SCXRD) suggests that both the title
compounds, (R)-1 and (S)-1, crystallize in the polar monoclinic space group, P21 (no. 4) with the same unit cell parameters.
Interestingly, the chirality of the chiral organic cations has determined
the chirality of the reported complexes. Because the structures of
both (R)-1 and (S)-1 are basically the same except for the chirality, only
the detailed structural description of (R)-1 is provided here. (R)-1 can be classified
as a molecular compound that is composed of (R)-1-phenylethylammonium ([C8H12N]+) cations and [Bi2Br10]4– anions (Figure 1).
As seen in Figures 2 and S2, four unique (R)-1-phenylethylammonium cations exist in the unit cell,
where all of the chiral centers, i.e., C(7), C(15), C(23), and C(31)
are (R)-configurations and responsible for the overall
chirality of (R)-1. Two unique Bi3+ cations in an asymmetric unit are coordinated by six bromide
ligands in distorted BiBr6 octahedral coordination environments.
The observed Bi–Br bond distances and Br–Bi–Br
bond angles are 2.6826(16)–3.1376(15) Å and 82.61(3)–179.29(5)°,
respectively. Each BiBr6 octahedron shares its edge through
Br(5) and Br(6) and forms [Bi2Br10]4– anionic dimers. It should be noted that the edge-shared [Bi2Br10]4– dimers are strongly distorted.
In other words, whereas the bond lengths between Bi3+ and
terminal Br– are shorter [2.6826(16)–2.8637(16)
Å], those between Bi3+ and bridging Br– are significantly longer [3.0213(12)–3.1376(15) Å] attributed
to a trans effect.39 Thus, the stereochemically
rather less-active lone pairs on Bi3+ seem to be pointing
to the edges of [Bi2Br10]4– dimers. In addition, the BiBr6 octahedral distortion
should be influenced by the hydrogen-bonding interactions between
N–H in (R)-1-phenylethylammonium
cations and Br– (N–H···Br).
Specifically, all the NH3+ cations in (R)-1-phenylethylammonium group interact with
Br– ligands in axial position or bridging Br– ligands in [Bi2Br10]4– octahedra. Thus, the bond distances between Bi3+ and
Br– ligands in the axial position [2.8343(16)–2.8637(16)
Å] are longer than those between Bi3+ and Br– ligands in the equatorial position [2.6826(16)–2.7542(12)
Å] and the polyhedra are tilted toward the NH3+ cations (Figure S3). Detailed
hydrogen bonding interactions are tabulated in the Supporting Information. The bond valence sum calculations40 result in values of 3.21–3.24, 0.60–0.62,
and 0.52–0.84 for Bi3+, bridging Br–, and terminal Br–, respectively (Table S2). The lower bond valence values for the bridging
Br– ligands, Br(5) and Br(6), should be due to the
hydrogen-bonding interactions.

that the two compounds (R)-1 and (S)-1 are enantiomorphic to each other.

temperature, projected along the b-axis.

Thermal and Humidity Stability
Thermal
analyses performed
on the ground samples of compound (R)-1 revealed that the material is thermally stable up to ca. 220 °C
(Figure S4). Upon further heating, the
compound continuously lost weight and completely decomposed and evaporated
by ca. 600 °C. Moisture stability for thin film and polycrystalline
samples of compound (R)-1 was also tested.
Both thin film and polycrystalline samples of (R)-1 were exposed at conditions with 95 ± 5 and 65% relative
humidity, respectively, for over 30 days. Powder X-ray diffraction
(PXRD) patterns for both polycrystalline and thin film samples of (R)-1 exposed to humidity for 30 days are
exactly same as that of the dried authentic sample, which indicates
that both polycrystalline and thin film samples of (R)-1 are very robust to moisture (Figures 3 and S5).

Figure 3 (a–c) PXRD patterns of compound (R)-1 exposed to humidity (95 ± 5% relative humidity) and
(d) calculated patterns. All the measured PXRD patterns for the samples
exposed to humidity for long time are consistent with the calculated
pattern, indicating the compound is robust to moisture.

IR and UV–Vis Diffuse Reflectance
Spectroscopy
The constituting functional groups in the organic
cations were successfully
identified by the IR spectroscopy. The existence of ammonium overtones
near 2500 and 2000 cm–1, and the presence of stretching
vibrations of Ar–H and C=C at around 3108 and 1450–1600
cm–1, indicating the aromatic character were confirmed
by the presence of 1-phenylethylammonium cations in the compounds
(Figure S6).

The experimental optical
band gap was determined by converting the UV–vis diffuse reflectance
spectrum of the chiral compound to the absorbance spectrum by the
Kubelka–Munk transformation and extrapolating the F(R) versus energy (eV) curve to zero. The optical
band gap and the cutoff wavelength are calculated to be ca. 2.88 eV
and 427 nm, respectively (Figure 4). The gentle curves found in the UV–vis absorption
spectra suggest that the band edge of the reported chiral compounds
may have indirect band gaps.41 The band
gaps of the reported chiral compounds are similar to those of other
various organic–inorganic halide materials.30,42−44 Because the band gaps of a series of halides compounds
are varied by changing the constituting halides (Cl–, Br– and I–), the related materials
can be used in optoelectronic devices by controlling the stoichiometry
of halide anions.

optical
band gap of compound (R)-1. Absorbance
was observed from the cutoff wavelength of 429 nm (2.88 eV) to the
deep-ultraviolet range (wavelength below 350 nm).

Chirality in Thin Films
Compounds (R)-1 and (S)-1 are confirmed
to be (R)- and (S)-configurations
at the benzylic carbon site, i.e., the chiral center of 1-phenylethylammonium
cation, by SCXRD analysis. We further investigated if the chiral crystalline
compounds could be uniformly deposited on substrates as thin films
with the same chemical compositions. First, each synthesized chiral
compound was redissolved in N,N′-dimethylformamide
(DMF) to form precursor solutions, and the corresponding thin films
with the thickness of several hundred nanometers were successfully
deposited on glass substrates through spin-coating processes (Figure 5). The energy-dispersive
X-ray (EDX) analyses on the chiral thin films revealed that the compositions
of the prepared films were also the same as those of single crystals
(Figure S1b). The PXRD analysis of thin
films indicated that the crystals grow along the (h00) direction (Figure 6). In the case of thin films of homogeneously deposited chiral compounds,
the preferred orientation strongly occurs along a specific direction.
The optical activity of thin films was also analyzed by transmittance
circular dichroism (CD) analysis. Both (R)-1 and (S)-1 were deposited on quartz
substrates with high transmittance up to the wavelength range of the
deep UV region because the absorbance of chiral compounds (R)-1 and (S)-1 were
observed in the low-UV region (wavelength below 400 nm). Left and
right circularly polarized lights (CPL) with wavelengths from 400
to 180 nm were irradiated on the chiral thin films and the CD spectra
were determined by the difference in the absorption of CPL (Figure 7). The CD spectra
of (R)-1 and (S)-1, which are symmetrical to each other (mirrored CD signal),
clearly demonstrate that the two chiral thin films have different
optical properties and contain absolute configuration of R and S, respectively. The CD signal of thin film (R)-1 is first observed in the range of 380–317
nm attributed to CPL absorption, and the value of CD signal is inverted
at 353 nm. Then, the CPL absorption increases to 240 nm and decreases
slightly at around 200 nm; however, the absorption of CPL is maintained.
The CD signal is significantly reversed near 231 and 212 nm. As described
above, the phenomenon that the signal changes in the opposite direction,
whereas the absolute magnitude of the optical rotation crosses zero
at the maximum absorbance (353 nm) is called the Cotton effect.45,46 Whereas the (R)-1 thin film exhibits
a positive Cotton effect after optical rotation decreases first as
the wavelength decreases, the (S)-1 thin
film exhibits the opposite negative Cotton effect (green area in Figure 7). Also, multiple
Cotton effect curves were observed because the absorption does not
increase or decrease constantly in the range of 260–180 nm
(yellow area in Figure 7). The maximum absorption wavelengths of free (R)-(+)-1-phenylethylamine ((R)-1-PEA) and (S)-(−)-1-phenylethylamine ((S)-1-PEA)
organics were reported to be about 260 nm.24,47,48 A complete change of CD signals for thin
films of compounds (R)-1 and (S)-1 indicates that the CD signals are not just caused
by the simple chiral organic cations but by more complex interactions.
Anisotropy factors (g) were calculated from the wavelength
range of 400–180 nm to obtain the concentration-independent
values (Figure S7). The maximum anisotropy
factor of (R)-1 and (S)-1 thin films was 8.02 × 10–4 and
1.28 × 10–3 at 203 nm, respectively, which
are similar to the values observed from other chiral QDs or hybrid
semiconductor materials.49,50

Electronic Band Gap Calculations
Density function theory
(DFT) calculations were performed to investigate the electronic structure
of compound (R)-1. Partial density of
state (PDOS) was calculated using an optimized crystallographic geometry.
The calculated Fermi level was fixed at 0 eV and the energy level
of each atomic orbital was adjusted. The valence band maximum (VBM)
and the conduction band minimum (CBM) energy were calculated to be
−1.76 and 1.44 eV, respectively (Figure 8). The slight overestimation of the calculated
band gap energy (3.2 eV) compared to the measured optical band gap
(2.88 eV) is possibly attributed to the exclusion of the spin–orbit
coupling effect in the self-consistent field (SCF) calculation.29,51 As seen in the partial density of state (PDOS), the s- and p-orbitals
of carbon and nitrogen are mostly overlapped with the 1s orbital of
hydrogen, which well accounts for C–H and N–H covalent
bonds (Figure 8). Orbitals
of bismuth and bromine are also fully overlapped, indicating that
the strong Bi–Br covalent bonds can form an octahedral structure.
VBM originates mostly from Br 4p orbital, and CBM originates from
Bi 6p orbital. Therefore, it can be seen that the inorganic anion,
bromobismuthates(III), has a significant influence on the band gap
energy. C 2p orbital has a considerable effect on both VBM and CBM,
which were derived from the π-bonding orbital and π*-antibonding
orbital, respectively, in the benzene ring of aromatic organic molecules.
Hence, once the band gap of the OIHM is carefully controlled by changing
the constituting halides and organic molecules, various optoelectronic
applications would be possible.

0 eV represents

Powder Second Harmonic
Generation (SHG) Measurements
The nonlinear optical (NLO)
properties were measured because two
chiral compounds with (R)- and (S)-configuration crystallized in the polar space group, P21. The plot of the SHG intensity measured at each distinct
particle size ranges for the ground crystals of (R)-1 is shown in Figure 9. As seen in Figure 9, the SHG efficiency of (R)-1 increased to near the coherence length of the compound, 63 μm,
and then decreased rapidly, i.e., type I nonphase matchable.52(R)-1 also exhibited
an SHG efficiency of ca. 20 times that of polycrystalline α-SiO2. In fact, the development of phase-matchable polar materials
with large NLO coefficients by careful alignment of asymmetric units
should be critical for applications. The SHG effect of polar materials
can be explained by the direction and magnitude of the dipole moment.53−55 The dipole moment directions of bismuth octahedra are shown in Figure S8. Dipole moment calculations for (R)-1 indicate that the approximate direction
of Bi(1)Br6 and Bi(2)Br6 octahedra are (101)
and (3̅1̅3̅), respectively (Table S5). Also, the energy calculations of four 1-phenylethylammonium
cations using the computer program Gaussian resulted in dipole moments
along the four approximate directions of (2̅01̅), (201),
(31̅1), and (201). Thus, an overall dipole moment of 16.5 D
is observed along the approximate (31̅1) direction.

Conclusions
In
summary, two polar chiral bismuth bromides, [((R)-C8H12N)4][Bi2Br10] and [((S)-C8H12N)4][Bi2Br10], which are optical isomers,
were synthesized through a mild solution chemistry method using chiral
organic structure-directing cations. The new Bi-based organic–inorganic
hybrid materials reveal the chiral NCS structures affected by chiral
organic molecules. The second-order NLO properties resulting from
this structural NCS were confirmed by measuring the powder SHG. The
direction and magnitude of the dipole moments for BiBr6 octahedra and 1-phenylethylammonium cations were calculated to determine
the origin of SHG. The title compounds were robust to moisture for
more than 1 month and thermally stable up to 220 °C. High-quality
uniform thin films of the reported chiral materials were also successfully
obtained on glass substrates by simple spin-coating methods. The deposited
films with several hundred nanometers of thicknesses exhibited a strong
preferred orientation along the a-axis direction.
The chirality of the thin films was confirmed by solid-state CD spectroscopy
revealing the opposite CPL absorption differences. The newly discovered
chiral thin films are expected to be used as a useful platform for
various surface interface reactions and applications. We are in the
process of tuning the band gaps of the series OIHMs by controlling
the halides and their stoichiometry for developing novel lead-free
photovoltaic devices and will be reporting on them soon.

Experimental
Section
Synthesis
(R)-(+)-1-Phenylethylamine
((R)-1-PEA, >99%), (S)-(−)-1-phenylethylamine
((S)-1-PEA, >99%), N,N′-dimethylformamide (DMF, anhydrous, 99.9%), bismuth(III)
bromide (BiBr3, 99.9%), and hydrobromic acid (HBr, 48 wt
%) were purchased from Alfa Aesar. Single crystals of [((R)-C8H12N)4][Bi2Br10] [(R)-1] and
[((S)-C8H12N)4][Bi2Br10] [(S)-1] were grown through a slow evaporation method. BiBr3 (0.8
× 10–3 mol, 0.359 g) and (R)- or (S)-1-phenylethylamine (1.6 × 10–3 mol, 0.206 mL) were dissolved in 6 mL of a 48% HBr
aqueous solution. After heating at 60 °C for 20 min, the solution
mixtures were slowly cooled to room temperature. Yellow crystals of
compounds (R)-1 and (S)-1 were grown in 2 days as the solvent was slowly evaporated.

Thin films of chiral compounds were prepared on square quartz plate
substrates with a transmittance of 80% or more at low-wavelength (250
nm) regions. First, the substrate was ultrasonically treated with
isopropyl alcohol for 10 min, and the substrate surface was further
treated with oxygen plasma for 15 min. Crystals of compounds (R)-1 and (S)-1 were then dissolved in DMF to prepare the precursor solutions (20
wt %). Films were spin-coated on the clean substrates by taking 30
μL of the precursor solutions. The rate of the spin coater reached
2000 rpm in 2 s and the coating time was 30 s. The coated films were
annealed at 80 °C for 10 min with a hot plate.

Structure Determination
Single-crystal X-ray diffraction
(SCXRD) data for compound (R)-1 were
obtained using Bruker SMART BREEZE diffractometer on graphite-monochromated
Mo Kα radiation (λ 0.71073 Å) and a 1 K charge coupled
device (CCD) area detector at room temperature. The diffraction data
for compound (S)-1 were collected at
room temperature on an ADSC Quantum-210 CCD diffractometer with synchrotron
radiation (λ 0.63000 Å) at two-dimensional supramolecular
crystallography at the Pohang Accelerator Laboratory, Korea. To monitor
any possible phase transitions at lower temperatures, SCXRD data for
each compound were also collected with the same synchrotron radiation
method at 100 K. A yellow plate (0.200 mm × 0.139 mm × 0.122
mm) for compound (R)-1 and a yellow
plate (0.098 mm × 0.033 mm × 0.014 mm) for compound (S)-1 were used for SCXRD measurements. The
data were integrated using the SAINT (version 8.27A) program56 or the HKL3000sm (version 703r) program.57 Intensity correction was performed based on
air absorption, polarization, and Lorentz factor. Semiempirical absorption
correction was applied by the SADABS (version 2012/1) program58 or HKL3000sm program. The crystal structures
were solved and refined with the programs SHELXS-2013 and SHELXL-2013,
respectively,59 implemented in the WinGX-2014.60 Relevant crystallographic information for compounds (R)-1 and (S)-1 is listed in Table 1.

Powder
X-ray diffraction (PXRD) data were obtained at room temperature
using a Bruker D8 ADVANCE diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation
(λ 1.5418 Å). Samples mounted on glass sample holders were
scanned in the 2θ range of 5–70° with the step size
and step time of 0.02° and 0.1 s, respectively. Phase purity
of the samples was verified by comparing the calculated data obtained
from single-crystal X-ray diffraction model with the measured PXRD
patterns. The chirality of the two enantiomer compounds (R)-1 and (S)-1 could
not be distinguished from the PXRD data.

Characterization
The dipole moment calculations for
organic molecules were performed with the Gaussian 09 package.61 The geometries of the organic molecules were
determined via the SCXRD data and self-consistent field (SCF) energy
calculation was performed without optimization. All the atoms were
calculated at the density functional B3PW91/6-311G(d, p) level.62

The electronic band gap of the compound (R)-1 was investigated using density function
theory (DFT) calculation methods. The SCXRD data were used for structural
optimization. All the calculations were implemented via open-source
PWscf code in Quantum Espresso package.63 Ultrasoft pseudopotentials64 with nonlinear
core correction65 and the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof66 exchange–correlation functional were
used for all elements (Bi, Br, C, N, and H). The plane-wave kinetic
energy and charge density cutoffs used in the SCF calculations were
ca. 56 and 506 Ry, respectively, and a 3 × 3 × 3 grid was
used for Brillouin zone sampling. The convergence threshold of the
ground state energy was set to 1.0 × 10–6 Ry.

IR spectra of compounds (R)-1 and (S)-1 were collected using a Nicolet 6700
FT-IR spectrometer in the spectral range of 400–4000 cm–1 at room temperature with the prepared pellets. Approximately
1 mg of powder samples were intimately ground with 100 mg of predried
KBr and compressed into transparent disk-shaped pellets.

UV–vis
diffuse reflectance spectra for compounds (R)-1 and (S)-1 were
measured on a Varian Cary 500 scan UV–vis NIR spectrometer
at room temperature in the range of 200–2500 nm. The band gap
energy was calculated using the following Kubelka–Munk function67,68  where S, K, and R represent the scattering coefficient, absorption
coefficient, and reflectance, respectively. The plotted graphs of F(R) versus hν of
compounds (R)-1 and (S)-1 resulted in the calculated band gap, Eg, of 2.88 eV.

Circular dichroism (CD) spectra (400–180
nm) for compounds (R)-1 and (S)-1 films spin-coated in quartz plates were measured
on JASCO J-815
CD spectrometer. Chiral thin films of (R)-1 and (S)-1 were measured in a CD module
with nitrogen gas purged, and the background was nondeposited quartz
plate. Scanning speed and data interval were measured at 100 nm min–1 and 0.5 nm, respectively. The integrating sphere
was used to collect the scattered light into the detector. The CD
spectra of background and thin films were obtained by averaging 3
scans. The high-tension (HT) voltage of the photomultiplier tube detector
was set not to exceed 800 V to collect reliable CD data. The anisotropy
factor (g) was calculated according to the following
formula  where ΔA and A represent the absorbance difference
between the left and
the right circularly polarized light of the sample and the absorbance
of unpolarized light, respectively.49

Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was conducted on a SCINCO TGA
N1000 thermal analyzer from room temperature to 900 °C with an
increasing rate of 10 °C min–1 under flowing
argon.

Scanning electron microscope (SEM)–energy-dispersive
analysis
by X-ray (EDX) analyses for compounds (R)-1 and (S)-1 were performed on Hitachi
S-3400N and Horiba Energy EX-250 instruments. Elemental analysis was
performed on a Carlo Erba EA 1108 CHNS_O analyzer at the Organic Chemistry
Research Center, Sogang University. The atomic ratios obtained by
EDX and EA agreed well with the chemical formulae obtained from the
SCXRD data. The EDX data reveal that the atomic ratio of Bi and Br
for both (R)-1 and (S)-1 was 1.0:5.0 (Figure S1a). Calculated
element ratio: C, 22.53%; H, 2.84%; N, 3.28%, EA analysis data of (R)-1: C, 22.53%; H, 2.83%; N, 3.24%, and (S)-1: C, 22.54%; H, 2.86%; N, 3.26%.

The surface and cross-sectional information of the chiral thin
film was obtained by FE-SEM by a Carl Zeiss SIGMA instrument with
the InLens and type II secondary electrons (SE2) detectors.

To determine the SHG efficiency, crystals of compounds (R)-1 and (S)-1 were
finely ground and sieved into different particle size ranges (<20,
20–45, 45–63, 63–90, 90–125, and 125–150
μm). The sieved powder samples were loaded into different capillary
tubes and the SHG was measured using a DAWA Q-switched Nd:YAG laser
(1064 nm radiation at 20 Hz). The SHG of polycrystalline α-SiO2 with the same particle size ranges was also measured as standard
materials and the efficiencies were compared.
