Solvated
two-dimensional nanosheets of copper hydroxy dodecylsulfate
in 1-butanol react with thiourea under microwave irradiation to yield
surfactant-free porous aggregates of CuS nanoparticles. These aggregates
exhibit excellent photocatalytic activity toward degradation of methylene
blue, methyl orange, and 4-chlorophenol in natural sunlight. While
the high surface area (14.74 m2 g–1)
and porosity increase the active reaction centers for adsorption and
degradation of organic molecules, quantum confinement results in a
low recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes. Chemical
and photogenerated hydroxyl radicals cause the oxidation of the dyes
and 4-chlorophenol.

1 Introduction
Copper
sulfide (hexagonal covellite, CuS) is a p-type semiconductor
with a band gap of ∼2 eV that enables it to absorb a large
fraction of the solar spectrum.1,2 In addition, a high
concentration of charge carriers due to copper vacancies leads to
plasmonic absorption in the infrared region.3−8 Thus, CuS nanostructures are of interest for photovoltaic1,2,9−13 and photocatalytic applications.1,2,14−22 The morphology, size, and surface area of CuS nanostructures control
its photocatalytic efficiency.1,2 Porous nanostructures
with a large active surface area are highly desired for catalytic
applications.23−25 Coprecipitation, solvothermal reactions, or hot injection
synthesis routes yield monodispersed or hierarchical self-assembled
CuS nanostructures.1,2 In general, porous nanostructures
are usually synthesized with the aid of templates such as block copolymers,
surfactant mesophases, and lyotropic liquid crystals.26,27 The templates or pore-directing agents are eventually removed by
chemical or thermal methods.23−27 Sacrificial template-directed chemical transformation based on the
Kirkendall effect is known to yield porous hollow CuS nanostructures.14,28−33 Xu et al.34 reported the synthesis of
nanoporous CuS through dealloying of Ti–Cu alloy using 15 M
H2SO4. Facile and efficient synthesis of porous
CuS is still a challenge.

Exfoliation of layered transition
metal hydroxides yields colloidal
dispersions of solvated 2-D metal hydroxide layers.35,36 These nanosheets can be chemically reacted at room temperature or
under solvothermal conditions to yield nanostructures of metals and
metal oxides.36−40 In contrast to multistep reactions involving metal salts/complexes
and surfactants, a single-step reaction employing solvated hydroxide
nanosheets as a precursor results in unusual shapes and interesting
properties.36 Although we have employed
this method to synthesize nanostructures of metal oxides and metals
(through solvothermal reduction), we have not explored the possibilities
of reacting the hydroxide nanosheets with suitable reagents to form
compounds other than metals and metal oxides. Would it be possible
to treat the metal hydroxide nanosheets with a chalcogenide source
to form metal chalcogenide nanostructures? Because the decomposition
of hydroxide sheets41 prior to sulfidation
is expected to result in a porous structure, metal sulfide formed
could also be porous. Keeping in mind the need for developing simpler
routes to porous CuS, and to explore the possibilities of extending
the use of solvated metal hydroxide nanosheets in the synthesis of
chalcogenide nanostructures, we have studied the synthesis of CuS
nanostructures using solvated nanosheets of copper hydroxy dodecylsulfate.

Facilitation of recycling and reuse of water demands a sustainable
approach for waste water treatment. Advanced oxidation processes (AOP)
are efficiently able to destroy the persistent organic pollutants
through Fenton reactions, wherein strongly oxidizing hydroxyl radicals
(·OH) generated in situ with the aid of primary oxidants
(ozone, hydrogen peroxide, oxygen) and/or energy sources (ultraviolet
light) or catalysts (Fe2+, titanium dioxide) nonselectively
oxidize the organic compound to carbon dioxide and water.42 AOP also encompass techniques that involve other
reactive oxidants, such as SO4·– and Cl· and also
those that enable direct electron transfer. Homogeneous AOP that involve
activation of H2O2 to produce ·OH through dissolved Fe2+/Fe3+ redox pair suffer
from fundamental drawbacks such as retarded reduction kinetics of
the redox cycle and pH-dependent efficiency. Nanomaterials (2-D layered
solids, semiconductor metal oxides/sulfides) with inherent properties
such as rapid charge transfer, large surface area, optimal charge
diffusion, and path length have been explored as heterogeneous catalysts43−46 in AOP to overcome these drawbacks. In this context, porous aggregates
of CuS nanoparticles are explored as a photocatalyst in photochemical
degradation of organic dyes (methylene blue, methyl orange) and carcinogenic
4-chlorophenol under natural sunlight.

2 Results
and Discussion
The XRD pattern of layered copper hydroxy
dodecylsulfate (Figure 1A(a)) shows a series
of 00l reflections, indicating that the hydroxy salt
is well ordered along the stacking direction. The basal spacing of
2.9 nm calculated from the 00l reflections confirms
the interlayer incorporation of dodecylsulfate ions.37 The absence of in-plane reflections (Figure 1A(a)) indicates an oriented growth along
the c direction. The SEM image of the as-prepared
copper hydroxy dodecylsulfate (Figure 1B) exhibits a layered morphology with platelets of
varying lateral sizes.

and (b) porous
aggregates of CuS nanoparticles obtained upon microwave irradiation

presence of thiourea. (B) SEM image of the as-prepared layered copper
hydroxy dodecylsulfate.

Copper hydroxy dodecylsulfate exfoliates in 1-butanol, resulting
in a colloidal dispersion of mono- to few-layer-thick nanosheets of
varying lateral sizes.37 Upon microwave
heating, the mixture of copper hydroxy salt nanosheets and thiourea
yields a black product. The XRD pattern of the product (Figure 1A(b)) could be indexed to an
hexagonal covellite CuS phase with cell parameters a = 3.79 Å and c = 16.34 Å (JCPDS 78-2121).
Peaks due to impurities are not observed, indicating the formation
of a pure CuS phase. The average crystallite size calculated from
XRD peak broadening is ∼10 nm. The infrared spectrum of CuS
(Figure S1b, Supporting Information) indicates
that it is free of the surfactant dodecylsulfate.

The chemical
composition of porous aggregates of CuS was further
probed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Core-level Cu 2p
spectra (Figure 2a)
exhibit peaks at 932.35 and 953.16 eV, indicating the presence of
Cu2+ in CuS.48 Satellite peaks
at 938.43 and 959.37 eV correspond to the paramagnetic chemical state
of Cu2+.48 Binding energies
of 161.69 and 162.89 eV in the case of S 2p core-level spectra (Figure 2b) indicate the presence
of S2–.

Figure 2 XPS spectra showing Cu 2p (a) and S 2p (b) core-level
peak regions
of porous aggregates of CuS.

The morphology of CuS was investigated by scanning and transmission
electron microscopy. The SEM image (Figure S2, Supporting Information) indicates that CuS largely consists
of aggregates of roughly spherical nanoparticles. Low-magnification
(Figure 3a,b) and high-magnification
(Figure 3c) bright-field
TEM images of CuS reveal that nanoparticles of ∼10 nm form
a porous network. The HRTEM image of porous CuS nanostructures (Figure 3d) clearly shows
that the nanoparticles are single crystals exhibiting fringes due
to 103 planes.

Figure 3 (a–c) Bright-field TEM images and (d) HRTEM image
of CuS
nanostructures obtained upon microwave irradiation of the colloidal
dispersion of copper hydroxy dodecylsulfate in the presence of thiourea.

The mechanism of formation of
porous aggregates of CuS nanoparticles
is schematically depicted in Figure 4. Upon microwave heating, the thermally unstable copper
hydroxide nanosheets undergo dehydroxylation and simultaneous sulfidation
in the presence of an excess of S2– released upon
decomposition of thiourea. The rapid dehydroxylation of the hydroxide
layers results in a porous network of nanoparticles of uniform sizes.
Atomic force microscopy images of copper hydroxy dodecylsulfate layers
and porous CuS (Figure S3, Supporting Information) corroborate the mechanism.

Figure 4 Schematic representation of formation of porous
aggregates of CuS
nanoparticles.

The surface area and
pore size of CuS nanostructures were obtained
from nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms (Figure 5a) using the multiple-point
BET method. While the specific surface area was measured using the
lower part of the adsorption isotherm, the desorption curve of the
isotherm was used for pore size analysis. While the surface area of
14.74 m2 g–1 of our nanoporous CuS is
lower than that reported for porous CuS by Xu et al.,34 the pore volume of 11 × 10–2 cm3 g–1 and pore radius of 2.12 nm are comparable
with that reported in the literature for nanoporous CuS.48

(diffuse reflectance) spectrum, and (c) Tauc plot of porous aggregates
of CuS obtained upon microwave irradiation of the colloidal dispersion
of copper hydroxy dodecylsulfate in the presence of thiourea.

Porous aggregates of CuS nanoparticles
exhibit strong absorption
in the entire visible region (Figure 5b). Absorption beyond 800 nm (near-IR region) is attributed
to the interband transitions of free carriers from valence to unoccupied
states.3−8,49 Intense absorption in the entire
visible range implies that porous CuS would be a good visible light
harvester. The optical energy band gap (Eg) is determined from the optical spectra by extrapolating the linear
region of the plot of (αhν)2 versus hν (Figure 5c), where hν is the photon energy, α is the absorption, h is the Planck’s constant, and ν is the frequency. Eg is estimated to be 2.0 eV, which is comparable
to the band gap of CuS reported in the literature.48

The photocatalytic activity of porous aggregates
of CuS nanoparticles
in the degradation of MB, MO, and 4-chlorophenol was evaluated under
natural sunlight. In all cases, prior to photocatalytic degradation,
adsorption–desorption equilibrium in the dark indicates negligible
adsorption. Figure 6a–c represents time-resolved UV–visible absorption
spectra of photocatalytic degradation of MB, MO, and 4-chlorophenol,
respectively. In each of the cases, the intensity of the prominent
absorption decreases with time. The log (absorbance) versus time plots
(Figure 6d,e) of MB
and 4-chlorophenol degradation indicate a pseudo-first-order kinetics
with rate constants of 4.6 × 10–1 and 4.5 ×
10–2 min–1, respectively. Over
several degradation cycles (Figure 6f), porous CuS exhibits consistent catalytic activity
with no significant change in morphology, composition, or surface
area (Figure S4, Supporting Information).

Figure 6 Degradations of dyes (10 mg L–1) and 4-chlorophenol
(100 mg L–1) were traced through UV–visible
absorption spectra of reaction mixtures containing 15 mg of porous
CuS aggregate as photocatalyst, 1 mL of 30% H2O2, and dye/4-chlorophenol. Evolution of absorption spectra with time

(f) Catalytic efficiency over repeated cycles in the case of MB degradation.

Table 1 compares
the photocatalytic degradation of methylene blue or 4-chlorophenol
in the presence and absence of the oxidizer H2O2. Since water and adsorbed oxygen on the surface of CuS may produce34,42,48 reactive ·OH
and ·O2–, one would expect
the degradation to occur even in the absence of H2O2. Although this is the case, the conversion percentages are
quite low (71% in 60 min for MB and a poor 30% in 60 min for 4-chlorophenol).
When H2O2 is added, the degradation kinetics
improves dramatically (∼100% for MB in 10 min and 93% for 4-chlorophenol
in 60 min). This is due to facile formation of ·OH
radicals from H2O2,34,42,48 which increases the net oxidizing species
concentration in solution. In addition, H2O2 accepts the photogenerated electrons from CuS, thus preventing electron–hole
recombination.34,42,48 In the absence of a catalyst, H2O2 is inefficient
in photochemical degradation of the pollutants (36% degradation of
MB in 60 min). Even in the dark, CuS catalyzes the degradation of
the pollutants. However, the conversion percentages are quite low.

The time taken for
complete MB degradation decreases with the mass
of the catalyst (Figure 7a). Nonlinear dependency appears to be exponential with saturation
beginning at 15 mg of the catalyst. One of the requisites of an ideal
catalyst is its ability to catalyze degradation of organics under
all pH conditions. The effect of pH on the degradation of MB (Figure 7b) clearly indicates
that porous aggregates of CuS nanoparticles effectively catalyze dye
degradation in a wide pH range of 3–8. Spontaneous decomposition
of H2O2 at pH > 8 leads to poor generation
of ·OH, thereby lowering the rate of dye degradation.

nanoparticles as catalyst and (b) pH.

In comparison to what has so far been reported in the literature
(Table 2), the enhanced
photocatalytic activity under ambient conditions in natural sunlight
renders porous aggregates of CuS nanoparticles not only a superior
catalyst but also a desired material for environmental amelioration.
Porous aggregates of CuS nanoparticles as a catalyst outperform most
of CuS-based nanocatalysts in MB degradation and are far superior
in MO degradation compared to CuS nanoflowers. More interestingly,
their performance in 4-chlorophenol degradation is over 30 times better
than that of hierarchical CuS.

The efficient degradation
of the different dyes and 4-chlorophenol
indicates that porous aggregates of CuS nanoparticles are an effective
photocatalyst with the ability to utilize a large fraction of the
solar spectrum. In addition, the porous network of fine CuS particles
induces a large density of low coordinated atoms on the surface and
edges.48 Defective high-energy CuS surfaces
favor fast ionic transfer between the surface and interior, facilitating
high reactivity between the reactive species and pollutants.48

3 Conclusions
Microwave
irradiation of solvated 2-D copper hydroxy salt nanosheets
in the presence of thiourea yields porous aggregates of CuS nanoparticles.
The successful formation of CuS nanostructures of interesting morphology
suggests that exfoliated metal hydroxide monolayers can be utilized
as precursors in the synthesis of metal chalcogenide nanostructures.
Metal hydroxide 2-D nanosheets act as self-templates yielding a porous
network with a large surface area. Porous aggregates of CuS nanoparticles
exhibit superior visible light catalytic activity and excellent recyclability
in the degradation of dyes and 4-chlorophenol.

4 Experimental
Section
4.1 Synthesis of Copper Hydroxy Dodecylsulfate
Layered copper hydroxy acetate, Cu2(OH)3(OOCCH3)·H2O, was prepared according to the method
reported by Yamanaka et al.47 Fifty milliliters
of 0.1 M NaOH was added dropwise to 50 mL of 0.094 M cupric acetate
solution with continuous vigorous stirring. The blue precipitate obtained
was washed with copious quantities of water followed by acetone and
dried at 65 °C. This solid was subjected to an anion exchange
reaction to obtain copper hydroxy dodecylsulfate, as reported in our
earlier work.37 Copper hydroxy acetate
(0.8 mmol, 0.2040 g) was added to a 30 mL solution containing 9.76
mmol (2.8145 g) sodium dodecylsulfate, and the mixture was stirred
at room temperature for 6 days. The resultant solid was separated
by centrifugation, washed with water followed by acetone, and dried
at 65 °C.

4.2 Synthesis of Copper Sulfide
Nanoparticle Aggregates
Copper hydroxydodecylsulfate (0.2
g) was exfoliated in 100 mL of
1-butanol by sonication for 1 h at room temperature to form a colloidal
dispersion.37 Thiourea (0.1 g) was added
to this dispersion, and the mixture was sonicated for 5 min. The resulting
mixture was subjected to microwave (MW) heating for 5 min in a domestic
microwave oven (2.45 GHz) operated at 800 W. At the end of heating,
the solution was cooled to room temperature. The black product was
isolated by centrifugation, washed with a mixture of ethanol and water
(1:1, v/v) followed by acetone, and dried in vacuum at room temperature.

4.3 Photocatalytic Degradation of Organic Pollutants
Porous aggregates of CuS nanoparticles were used as a catalyst
in photochemical degradation of organic dyes, methylene blue (MB)
and methyl orange (MO). Fifteen milligrams of CuS was dispersed in
100 mL of MB/MO solution (10 mg L–1), and the mixture
was stirred in the dark for 1 h to establish adsorption–desorption
equilibrium. One milliliter of 30% H2O2 solution
was added, and the mixture was allowed to react under irradiation
by natural sunlight and constant stirring. Degradations of MB and
MO were monitored by measuring the absorbance of MB at 664 nm and
that of MO at 464 nm. Porous CuS (15 mg) was also used in natural
sunlight photocatalytic degradation of 4-chlorophenol (100 mL, 100
mg L–1) in the presence of 1 mL of 30% H2O2.

4.4 Characterization
All samples were
characterized by recording powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns
using a PANalytical X’Pert Pro diffractometer (Cu Kα
radiation, secondary graphite monochromator, scanning rate of 1°
2θ/min). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis was carried
out using a Zeiss Ultra 55 field-emission scanning electron microscope
equipped with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). Transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) images were acquired with a Tecnai T20 operated
at 200 kV. UV–visible spectra of the reaction mixtures were
recorded on a Perkin Elmer (LS 35) UV–Visible spectrometer.
The nitrogen physisorption isotherms were recorded at 77 K using a
BELSORP system after degassing of samples at 60 °C for 3 h.
