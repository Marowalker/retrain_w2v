The high surface areas and tunable
properties of metal–organic
frameworks (MOFs) make them attractive materials for applications
in catalysis and the capture, storage, and separation of gases. Nevertheless,
the limited stability of some MOFs under humid conditions remains
a point of concern. Understanding the atomic-scale mechanisms associated
with MOF hydrolysis will aid in the design of new compounds that are
stable against water and other reactive species. Toward revealing
these mechanisms, the present study employs van der Waals-augmented
density functional theory, transition-state finding techniques, and
thermodynamic integration to predict the thermodynamics and kinetics
of water adsorption/insertion into the prototype compound, MOF-5.
Adsorption and insertion energetics were evaluated as a function of
water coverage, while accounting for the full periodicity of the MOF-5
crystal structure, that is, without resorting to cluster approximations
or structural simplifications. The calculations suggest that the thermodynamics
of MOF hydrolysis are coverage-dependent: water insertion into the
framework becomes exothermic only after a sufficient number of H2O molecules are coadsorbed in close proximity on a Zn–O
cluster. Above this coverage threshold, the adsorbed water clusters
facilitate facile water insertion via breaking of Zn–O bonds:
the calculated free-energy barrier for insertion is very low, 0.17
eV at 0 K and 0.04 eV at 300 K. Our calculations provide a highly
realistic description of the mechanisms underlying the hydrolysis
of MOFs under humid working conditions.

Introduction
Metal–organic
frameworks (MOFs) are crystalline, microporous
compounds with potential applications involving adsorption (i.e.,
gas storage, capture, and separation) and catalysis.1−4 MOFs hold the record for their specific surface area,5 and their structure and composition can be varied
extensively, resulting in many thousands of known6 and hypothetical MOFs7 with
a wide range of properties.

Despite this promise, several MOFs
are known to exhibit limited
stability to humidity,8−18 which would restrict their use in applications such as CO2 capture from flue gas or in contexts where exposure to air is likely.
For example, Chanut et al.16 examined CO2 adsorption in the presence of humidity across a wide range
of MOFs using thermogravimetry. Most MOFs exhibited at least a 10%
reduction in CO2 uptake in the presence of water. Similarly,
Zuluaga and co-workers17 reported on the
stability of MOF-74 in humid environments and on how this stability
impacts CO2 capture. It was shown that CO2 uptake
is reduced because of the presence of hydroxyl groups formed from
the dissociation of water. The hydroxyl attaches to the coordinatively
unsaturated metal sites, thereby blocking CO2 adsorption
on these favorable sites.

Perhaps the best-known example of
water stability issues in MOFs
occurs in the prototype compound MOF-5, which has attracted considerable
attention as a gas storage material because of its high storage densities.6,19−22 The degradation of MOF-5 following exposure to humid air has been
reported in several studies.11,23−28 For example, Long and co-workers reported on the hydrolysis of MOF-5
by measuring the X-ray diffraction spectrum and the hydrogen uptake
isotherm of a sample before and after exposure to air.23 Schröck and co-workers identified the
water loading threshold for the degradation of MOF-5; irreversible
decomposition was observed after an uptake of 8 wt % water.29 Cychosz and Matzger analyzed the structure of
several MOFs following exposure to dimethylformamide (2 mL) solutions
containing 50 to 2000 μL of water; they concluded that the MOF
stability was related to the composition and geometry of the metal
cluster of MOFs.30

Experiments conducted
by the present authors observed a sudden
increase in water uptake (type V isotherm) in MOF-5—coinciding
with a rapid, irreversible structure change—upon exposure to
air with a relative humidity of 50% or higher.31 Below this threshold, water uptake was limited and little
structure change was observed for exposure times lasting up to several
hours. The faster rates of decomposition observed at higher humidity
levels suggest that the (local) water coverage within the MOF may
influence the energetics associated with its irreversible hydrolysis.

Although the limited stability of MOF-5 with respect to water is
now well-established,8,11,23−31 the reaction mechanisms associated with water-induced degradation
have been difficult to uncover. To assist in identifying these mechanisms,
a small number of studies have employed (classical) molecular dynamics
(MD) and first-principles calculations to characterize the atomic-scale
features of this process. Greathouse and Allendorf performed one of
the earliest MD studies of the water/MOF-5 system.32 Using a semiempirical force field, they revealed that adsorbed
water interacts more strongly with Zn sites than with the carboxylate
linker, and that water molecules can insert into MOF-5 upon breaking
of Zn–O bonds.32 Han and co-workers
subsequently extended this approach by using the ReaxFF force field.33 This study proposed a reaction mechanism associated
with MOF hydrolysis in which adsorbed water dissociates into a hydroxyl
group and a proton. Subsequently, the −OH group bonds to Zn
by breaking the Zn–O bond between the metal cluster and the
linker. The remaining hydrogen then joins with the organic linker
to form carboxylic acid.33 The ReaxFF force
field was also recently used to study the water-induced degradation
of various isoreticular MOFs (IRMOFs).15

In principle, density functional theory (DFT)-based calculations
should provide a highly accurate description of the bond-breaking
processes during MOF hydrolysis. However, these calculations remain
a challenge because of the large number of atoms in the computational
cell (106 atoms in the MOF-5 primitive cell and 424 atoms in the conventional
cell). For this reason, cluster approximations34 or structural simplifications35−37 are commonly
adopted to make the calculations tractable. For example, Low and co-workers
used cluster models of several MOFs to examine their hydrothermal
stability.34 More recently, De Toni et
al. modeled the effect of water loading on the hydration process in
the simplified MOF-5 analogue, IRMOF-0h, in which the benzene ring
in the linker was replaced by a linear arrangement of two C atoms.35 Similarly, Bellarosa et al. studied the formation
of water clusters during the degradation process of MOF-5 using a
reduced-size primitive cell (1/8 the volume of the conventional unit
cell) constructed by adopting higher-symmetry linker orientations.36 A follow-on study by the same group examined
the impact of metal composition on the water stability of IRMOF-1
variants.37

Building on these earlier
investigations, the present study revisits
the reaction mechanism for MOF-5 hydrolysis using DFT calculations.
The primary goal is to elucidate the connection between water uptake
in MOF-5 and its hydrolysis. This is accomplished by calculating the
energetics of water insertion as a function of water coverage. Distinguishing
features of our approach are the use of a van der Waals-aware density
functional and the full treatment of the MOF crystal structure (i.e.,
without structural simplifications or cluster model approximations).
As a first step, we calculate the thermodynamics of water adsorption
at various sites in MOF-5. Subsequently, the energetics for hydrolysis
are evaluated as a function of the local coverage of water near the
Zn–O insertion point. Water insertion is found to be exothermic
only after a critical number of H2O molecules are adsorbed
in close proximity on a given Zn–O cluster. This finding corroborates
the experimental observations of an induction period—presumably
associated with the nucleation of small, adsorbed water clusters—preceding
hydrolysis.31,38 Finally, the reaction pathway
for water insertion into the framework was evaluated at two temperatures
using two approaches: at 0 K with the nudged elastic band (NEB) method
and at 300 K using thermodynamic integration (TI). In both cases,
the presence of explicit, adsorbed water molecules was accounted for.
For coverages where insertion is thermodynamically favorable, the
barrier for insertion is predicted to be very low, 0.17 eV at 0 K
and only 0.04 eV at 300 K. Such a small barrier indicates the likelihood
for rapid hydrolysis at moderate humidity levels, in agreement with
prior experiments.31

Results and Discussion
Adsorption
of Isolated Water Molecules
Figure 1a shows the conventional unit
cell of MOF-5. The crystal structure consists of benzenedicarboxylate
linkers and Zn4O metal–oxygen clusters, with these
clusters also commonly referred to as secondary building units (SBUs).
Five distinct sites were explored for water adsorption. These sites
are illustrated as large purple spheres in Figure 1b and labeled with the Greek letters α,
β, γ, δ, and ε. The positions of the sites
examined are similar to those described in prior experiments39 and simulations40 for the adsorption of Ar, N2, and H2 in MOF-5.
To our knowledge, a detailed sampling of the potential energy surface
for H2O adsorption on MOF-5 has not been reported. The
three sites α, β, and γ refer to the sites on the
Zn–O cluster, whereas δ and ε refer to the sites
on the benzene ring in the linker. Site α is the closest site
to the central oxygen in the Zn cluster; this site is also equidistant
to three of the Zn atoms bonded to the central oxygen. Site β
is closest to one of the four Zn atoms in the cluster and is equidistant
to three of the four oxygen atoms bonded to Zn. Site γ is proximate
to two oxygen atoms bonded to Zn. On the linker, site δ is centered
above the face of the benzene ring. Site ε is positioned at
the edge of the benzene, with equal distances to two hydrogen atoms. Table 1 lists the number
of each type of site on a single metal cluster or linker. In total,
there are 20 adsorption sites on the metal cluster and 12 sites on
the linker.

cluster and the organic linker from panel (a). The purple spheres

the adsorption energy, Ead, for a single
water molecule for each adsorption site as a function of the exchange–correlation
functional employed [Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE)-generalized
gradient approximation (GGA) and a van der Waals-aware density functional
(vdW-DF2)]. The vdW-DF2 predicts more exothermic binding energies
than does the GGA regardless of the adsorption geometry. This difference
is particularly large for the α site, where the binding predicted
by the GGA is approximately 0.2 eV weaker. The weaker binding observed
for the GGA is consistent with earlier calculations involving CO2 and CH4 adsorption in MOFs41−43 and can be
attributed to the lack of van der Waals interactions in this functional.
More generally, the range of binding energies predicted by the vdW-DF2
across all sites (∼0.23 eV) is significantly wider than that
predicted by the GGA; in the latter case, the adsorption energies
are clustered around −0.15 eV. This trend has also been observed
for the adsorption of small molecules in other MOFs.41−43 An additional difference between the functionals pertains to the
site preference for H2O adsorption. The α site is
predicted to be the most stable site for adsorption by the vdW-DF2,
whereas the GGA predicts the β site to be the most favorable.
We also note that the present calculations predict an adsorption energy
of −0.19 eV at the β site for the GGA functional; this
value is in good agreement with the energy (−0.20 eV) predicted
by a previous computational study.36

MOF-5 for the adsorption sites located on the metal cluster (sites

Figure 2b–d
tabulates the bond distances between the proximal oxygen atom in an
adsorbed water molecule and various atoms in the MOF. This is done
for the adsorption sites located on the metal cluster (sites α,
β, and γ) as a function of the exchange–correlation
functional. In all cases, the bond lengths are greater than 3 Å,
consistent with a weak, physisorption interaction. Distances predicted
by the vdW-DF2 are systematically shorter than those from the GGA;
this is expected, given the larger adsorption energies obtained with
the vdW-DF2, Figure 2a.

Another recent computational study of water adsorption in
a simplified
model of MOF-5 (IRMOF-0h) found a much shorter O(water)–Zn
distance of 2.0 Å.35 The data shown
in Figure 2b–d
suggest that the shorter distances found in that study are likely
an artifact of the structural simplifications employed there; in IRMOF-0h,
every benzene in the linker is replaced by two carbon atoms. By removing
the bulky benzene rings, it is conceivable that the water molecules
can gain closer access to the Zn4O metal cluster. This
assertion was verified by performing adsorption calculations on IRMOF-0h.
Indeed, water was observed to adsorb in this structure with much shorter
bond distances of 2.57 Å. Additional comparisons with the IRMOF-0h
structure used in ref (35) are provided in Figure S2 in the Supporting Information.

Adsorption of Multiple Water Molecules
In reality,
multiple water molecules can adsorb simultaneously on MOF-5 upon exposure
to humid air. According to our previous study,31 the saturation water loading in MOF-5 is ∼13 wt
% when exposed to air with a relative humidity exceeding 50%. Assuming
that all water molecules preferentially fill the most energetically
favorable adsorption sites (α, β, and γ sites residing
on the Zn–O cluster), this loading corresponds to the adsorption
of approximately five water molecules per metal cluster. We aim to
determine the dependence of water adsorption energies on the Zn–O
cluster as a function of coverage and adsorption geometry. To accomplish
this, multiple water molecules were placed at α, β, and
γ sites on the same Zn–O cluster. Coverages of 1–4
molecules were examined. We adopt a naming scheme in which the number
and identity of the filled sites specify the coverage and adsorbed
configuration. For example, the configuration identified as “αα”
contains two water molecules adsorbed on α sites. Similarly,
“αβγ” corresponds to a configuration
where three water molecules are adsorbed in α, β, and
γ sites simultaneously. Given the large number (∼1300)
of possible configurations for even a small number of adsorbed molecules
(4) on a single Zn–O cluster, a systematic enumeration of all
configurations was not attempted. Rather, a subset of configurations
in which the adsorbed molecules were clustered (i.e., adsorbed at
predominantly adjacent sites) was explored. Our preference for these
configurations is based on the expectation that water–water
interactions are energetically favorable at higher coverages.36

From Figure 1a, we observe that site α has the lowest
adsorption energy for a single water molecule. If water molecules
interact weakly, then we expect that only α sites will be filled,
as these sites are well-separated. Figure 3 compares the total adsorption energies for
the lowest energy adsorbed configurations identified by our search
to configurations in which only α sites are filled. For the
highest loading considered, four water molecules, the total adsorption
energy assuming that only α sites are occupied is −1.14
eV. For this αααα configuration, the distance
between adjacent H2O molecules is large, 5.74 Å, signaling
that H2O–H2O interactions are likely
weak. By contrast, a configuration in which H2O is adsorbed
with the configuration ααβγ yields a more
exothermic adsorption energy of −1.40 eV. In this case, the
water cluster adopts a more compact arrangement, with H2O–H2O distances given by 2.86 Å (α–β);
4.83 Å (α–γ); and 2.97 Å (β–γ).
A similar trend holds for loadings of two and three molecules: adsorption
is preferred in configurations that involve nearby αγ
and γγγ sites (on average, the γ–γ
distance is 2.9 Å). As anticipated, these data suggest that water–water
interactions play an important role during the adsorption process:
the incoming water molecules preferentially adsorb at adjacent sites
rather than filling only the widely separated α sites. This
tendency is consistent with the type V isotherm measured in our previous
study of water uptake in MOF-5;31 such
an isotherm indicates the presence of sizeable water–water
interactions.

Zn4O SBU as a function of coverage and adsorption configuration. For each coverage, the yellow bars (left) represent the adsorption
energy in the case where water molecules are widely separated by filling
only the α sites. (α sites were previously identified
as the most favorable sites for the adsorption of isolated H2O molecules.) The blue bars (right) represent the adsorption energy
for the most energetically favorable water distribution identified
amongst many candidate adsorbed geometries. Adsorption geometries
are labeled inside each bar.

Thermodynamics of Water Insertion
Having determined
the geometries and adsorption energies for small water clusters in
MOF-5, we next examine the energetics of water insertion into the
framework as a function of water coverage. Prior experiments indicate
that the hydrolysis of MOF-5 occurs more rapidly at higher water loadings
and is preceded by an induction period, presumably owing to the nucleation
of small water clusters.31,36,38 The exothermicity for water insertion was assessed by evaluating
the insertion energy: ΔE = Efinal – Einitial. In
this expression, Einitial corresponds
to a low-energy configuration of n adsorbed water
molecules on a given metal cluster, as previously described, and Efinal represents the energy of a related structure
in which one of the adsorbed molecules is inserted as a molecular
unit into the MOF by breaking a Zn–O bond. Water insertion
will be favorable if ΔE < 0. Several configurations
were considered as candidates for the final (inserted) geometry, including
various displacements and twists of the linker following the Zn–O
bond scission. ΔE was calculated for coverages
ranging from 1 to 4 water molecules.

In addition to the reactions
where water was inserted as a molecular unit, the energetics of dissociative
water insertion were also examined. In the latter scenario, relaxed
structures were generated in which the Zn–O bond present in
MOF-5 was broken and replaced by Zn–OH(water) and O–H(water)
bonds. However, the energy of these hypothetical structures was found
to be much higher (∼1 eV) than that of the initial, adsorbed
water cluster, indicating that water dissociation is not energetically
favorable in this configuration. This is consistent with the findings
of ref (36), which
reported that dissociative insertion was endothermic by 0.8 eV relative
to a metastable physisorbed state.

The insertion energy for
(molecular) water into MOF-5 as a function
of coverage is shown in Figure 4. With only one molecule adsorbed, water insertion is endothermic:
ΔE = 0.35 eV. Insertion becomes increasingly
less endothermic as the size of the water cluster grows to two or
three molecules. Finally, insertion becomes exothermic when the cluster
size reaches four molecules, with ΔE = −0.16
eV. The observation that water insertion is exothermic only at higher
coverages is roughly consistent with the experimental observations
of rapid degradation in MOF-5 upon exposure to air containing relatively
high concentrations of water (50% relative humidity or higher).31 As previously described, the water loading determined
in those isotherm experiments, equal to 13 wt % or approximately five
water molecules per metal cluster, is close to the loading identified
here (four molecules) and in an earlier GGA-based study.31 Although experiments suggest that degradation
is most rapid at a loading equivalent to five molecules per cluster,
entropic effects could shift some molecules to sites on the linker.
Such an effect would bring the predicted computational loading into
even better agreement with experiments.

water into MOF-5 as a function of coverage
on a Zn–O cluster. The labels within each bar indicate the
configuration of the adsorbed H2O cluster before insertion.

Reaction Pathway at T = 0 K
The reaction
pathway for water insertion is illustrated in Figure 5, and the minimum energy pathway for this
reaction at T = 0 K (evaluated using the NEB) is
plotted in Figure 6a. The initial state for the reaction is shown in Figure 5a, where four water molecules
are adsorbed at α, α, β, and γ sites, which
is the same low-energy configuration reported in Figure 3. (This configuration is also
depicted as the first NEB image/datapoint in Figure 6a, where its energy is assigned a value of
zero.) Upon approaching the transition state, shown in Figure 5b and corresponding to NEB
image 4 in Figure 6a, the water molecule occupying the β site migrates toward
the Zn atom. The energy barrier for this process is relatively small, only 0.17
eV. (The small maximum present at hyperdistance ∼10 Å
is likely an artifact of noise in the forces present on the images
that span this maximum.) Finally, Figure 5c represents the product state where the
water molecules have been inserted into the framework by breaking
a Zn–O bond. The inserted molecule forms a new bond of length
2.1 Å between Zn and O(water). The original (and now broken)
Zn–O(MOF) bond lengthens to 2.3 Å from its initial value
of 2.0 Å. The O(MOF) stranded by water insertion subsequently
forms a double bond with its neighboring C, that is, a carbonyl group.
Meanwhile, the three adsorbed water molecules remain in close proximity
to the inserted molecule, forming a “water chain” with
intermolecular H–O distances of 1.7–2.3 Å, Figure 5c. These distances
are consistent with the intermolecular H–O bond lengths typical
of hydrogen bonding in water, ∼2.0 Å. The formation of
such a water chain has also been discussed in prior studies35,36 and is expected to stabilize the transition and/or hydrolyzed states.

Figure 6 Energy profiles for water insertion into MOF-5 as a function of
reaction coordinate at (a) 0 and (b) 300 K. In (a), the static NEB
method is used to estimate the 0 K reaction barrier. In (b), the free-energy
barrier is evaluated using TI. r1 and r2 represent Zn–O distances, as shown
in Figure 5.

Reaction Pathway at T = 300 K
Figure 6b illustrates the
reaction pathway for water insertion at 300 K using TI.44 Different from the NEB calculation, the TI pathway
depicts the variation in free energy (i.e., including
entropic contributions) during MOF hydrolysis. The pathway was calculated
using nine intermediate TI images between the reactant (Figure 5a) and product (Figure 5c) states, with the reaction
coordinate ξ taken as the difference r1 – r2. Here, r1 represents the Zn–O bond length in MOF-5 (Figure 5a); this bond breaks
during the insertion of a H2O molecule, increasing from
2.0 to 2.3 Å. Similarly, r2 corresponds
to the Zn–O distance between a MOF Zn ion and the oxygen in
the inserted water molecule; this distance shrinks from 3.9 to 2.1
Å during water insertion. The reaction pathway is revealed by
varying r1 and r2 monotonically between the distances described above.

Figure 6a shows that
the transition state for water insertion at 300 K occurs for the values
of the reaction coordinate ξ between approximately −1.5
and −1.0 Å, corresponding to bond lengths r1 = 2.06 to 2.15 Å and r2 = 3.54 to 3.0 Å. The activation energy estimated by TI, 0.04
eV, is comparable to the thermal energy (kBT) at room temperature, indicating that water insertion
will be facile at 300 K. The free-energy barrier is also slightly
smaller than that obtained from the (static) 0 K NEB calculation,
0.17 eV. The modest temperature dependence of the activation energy
indicates that entropic effects play an important but not overwhelming
role in the reaction energetics. Furthermore, we note that the barriers
reported here are in qualitative agreement with earlier studies of
water insertion in MOF-5 that employed lower levels of theory and
simplified structural models. For example, the 0.08 eV barrier reported
in ref (35) is bounded
by the 0 and 300 K barriers estimated in the present study. Similarly,
ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) calculations performed by Bellarosa
et al.36 at 300 K revealed that water insertion
was barrierless for local coverages of five H2O molecules,
in good agreement with the 0.04 eV barrier reported here at the same
temperature with TI on a four-molecule adsorbed cluster.

Conclusions
Enhancing the robustness of MOFs to water and other reactive species
remains an important challenge in translating these materials from
the laboratory bench to practical applications. Understanding the
processes responsible for MOF hydrolysis is a prerequisite for the
rational design of new compounds with improved stability. Toward this
goal, the present study has examined the energetics associated with
water adsorption and insertion into the prototype compound MOF-5 as
a function of coverage. Distinguishing features of our study include
the use of a van der Waals-aware functional to capture dispersion
interactions present during molecular adsorption, evaluation of activation
(free) energies for water insertion at 0 and 300 K, and treatment
of the full periodic unit cell of MOF-5 without simplifications to
the crystal structure.

A comparison of the vdW-DF2 functional
with a conventional gradient-corrected
functional (PBE-GGA) revealed important qualitative and quantitative
differences regarding the energetics and site preference for water
adsorption. The vdW-DF2 favors water adsorption on the SBU, rather
than on the linker. This differs from the trend predicted by the PBE-GGA,
which exhibits a more uniform distribution of adsorption energies
on both the linker and SBU.

A key finding of our study is that
the thermodynamics of water
insertion into MOF-5 is coverage-dependent: insertion becomes thermodynamically
favorable only when a critical number of water molecules (four or
more) are coadsorbed as relatively compact clusters on the same Zn4O secondary building unit of the MOF. This observation is
in good agreement with experimental measurements, which show that
hydrolysis is slow at low water coverages and is preceded by an incubation
period; we speculate that the latter process is due to the nucleation
and growth of water clusters of sufficient size on a given SBU. Once
a sufficient coverage has been achieved, the insertion of molecular
water into the Zn–O bonds proceeds with a very low free-energy
activation barrier, 0.04 eV at 300 K, consistent with a rapid hydrolysis
reaction under ambient temperatures.

Our calculations lend further
support to the notion that the rate
of MOF degradation depends strongly on the operating environment.
Although it is now clear that some MOFs are unstable to hydrolysis
in an absolute sense, under low-to-moderate humidity conditions, the
rate of hydrolysis can be slow enough to allow exposure for several
days without significant degradation. Efforts to expand this “stability
window” to higher temperatures and humidity levels will benefit
from the mechanistic understanding provided by this study.

Computational
Methods
Water adsorption and insertion calculations were
performed using
density functional theory45 [Vienna ab
initio simulation package (VASP)46,47 code]. Calculations
were performed using conventional gradient-corrected functionals (PBE-GGA)48 and with the vdW-DF249 van der Waals-augmented functional. The MOF-5 crystal structure
was adopted from diffraction experiments.50 The full 3D periodic crystal structure based on the 106-atom MOF-5
primitive cell was used without cluster approximations or other structural
simplifications.34−37 All calculations were performed with a plane-wave energy cutoff
energy of 500 eV; the Brillouin zone was sampled at the Γ-point.
Interactions between the core and valence electrons were described
using the projector augmented-wave method47 with valence electron configurations as follows: Zn: 3d104s2; O: 2s22p4; and C: 2s22p2.

The water-free MOF-5 structure was optimized
separately using the
PBE-GGA functional and vdW-DF2 by minimizing the atomic forces and
stresses on the cell with respect to the cell shape, volume, and atom
positions. The lattice parameters obtained following these relaxations,
26.12 Å (PBE-GGA) and 26.35 Å (vdW-DF2), are in reasonable
agreement with the experimental values (25.67–25.89 Å).51

To identify the favorable locations for
water adsorption, a single
water molecule was placed at several candidate adsorption sites; for
each configuration, all atomic degrees of freedom were relaxed while
keeping the cell shape and volume fixed at the value obtained from
the relaxation of the water-free structure using the same functional
(GGA or vdW-DF2). The adsorption energy was calculated according to
the equation 1  Here, EMOF-5,water refers to the energy for MOF-5 with n adsorbed
water molecules, EMOF-5 is the
energy of the water-free MOF-5 cell, and Ewater is the energy of an isolated water molecule calculated using a orthorhombic
simulation cell with dimensions of 10 × 11 × 12 Å.

The climbing image NEB method52,53 was used to
calculate the activation energy for water insertion into MOF-5 at
0 K. Seven NEB images were used to evaluate the minimum energy reaction
pathway between the reactant (i.e., adsorbed water) and product (i.e.,
inserted water) states.

In addition to evaluating the activation
energy at 0 K, the free-energy
barrier at T = 300 K was determined using TI.44 In TI, the change in free energy between the
reactant (R) and product (P) states, ΔAR→P, is given by a path integral along a reaction coordinate
ξ connecting those states 2  The free-energy gradient, , is obtained from a series of constrained
AIMD simulations.44,54 AIMD was performed in the canonical
ensemble (NVT) at T = 300 K with an Andersen thermostat44,55 at a collision rate of 0.05 fs–1.56 The reaction path was composed of nine intermediate configurations
between the R and P states. Constrained AIMD was performed for 6 ps
on each of these 11 configurations with a time step of 1 fs. The last
4 ps of each trajectory was used to calculate the parameters for TI.
