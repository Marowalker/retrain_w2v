Aldose reductase is the first enzyme
of the polyol pathway in which
glucose is converted to fructose via sorbitol. The understanding of
this key enzyme is important as it has been linked to some diabetes
mellitus complications. The mechanism of the enzyme was investigated
using a hybrid quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) method.
It was found that depending on the protonation state of His110 the
mechanism can be concerted or stepwise and the proton donor can be
either Tyr48 or His110. These findings are different from the previous
theoretical studies based on QM/MM calculations using either AM1 or
HF/4-31G, in which the reduction is, respectively, a stepwise or one-step
process. The QM/MM energy barriers for the reduction of d-glyceraldehyde were evaluated at a B3LYP/6-31G* level for both HIP
and HIE protonation states of His110. These were, respectively, 6.5
± 2.2 and 16.7 ± 1.0 kcal/mol, which makes only the HIE
protonation state consistent with the experimental value of 14.8 kcal/mol
derived from kinetics experiments and makes Tyr48 the most probable
proton donor.

1 Introduction
Aldose
reductase (AR) (EC 1.1.1.21) is a cytosolic reduced nicotinamide
adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH)-dependent oxidoreductase enzyme
that belongs to the superfamily of aldo-keto reductases.1,2 Aldose reductase has been identified as the first enzyme involved
in the polyol pathway of glucose metabolism that converts glucose
to fructose via sorbitol.3 This is of particular
interest for the pharmaceutical industry as glucose overutilization
through the polyol pathway has been linked to tissue-based pathologies
associated with diabetes mellitus complications.3,4 AR
has thus been widely studied to develop potent AR inhibitors to prevent
or delay the onset and progression of these complications.5 As a result, the protein data bank (PDB) accounts
to date (February, 2017) for an impressive number of X-ray crystallographic
structures (136) of human aldose reductase.6

The human AR enzyme comprises 315 amino acid residues and
has a
β/α barrel structure (Figure 1a,b).7 The barrel
is composed of eight parallel β-strands and eight adjacent peripheral
α-helical segments that are running antiparallel to the β-sheet.
The catalytic active site is located in the barrel core. The nicotinamide
adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP) cofactor is situated at the
top of the COOH-terminal end of the β/α barrel, with the
nicotinamide ring projecting into the center of the barrel and the
pyrophosphate part on the border of the barrel.

model. (b) The structure viewed down the COOH-terminal end of the
β/α barrel. (c) Aldose reductase active site (PDB ID: 1ADS) with crystallographic
waters shown.

The reaction mechanism
of aldose reductase in the direction of
aldehyde reduction comprises two steps.8 The first step is the transfer of the pro-R hydride of NADPH to
the re face of the substrate’s carbonyl carbon.
The second step is the donation of a proton to reduce the carbonyl
to an alcohol (Scheme 1).

Scheme 1 Schematic Representation of Aldehyde Reduction by Aldose Reductase
Despite the acceptance of this
general mechanism, several key features
remain unclear. On the one hand, it is not known whether the reaction
occurs in a concerted or stepwise manner. On the other hand, it is
not clear which of the proximal residues, Tyr48 or His110, acts as
the proton donor. Indeed, both of these residues could potentially
occupy this function, as crystal structures indicate that they are
well positioned to be potential proton donors during catalysis; in
crystal structure 1ADS, a water molecule in close proximity to the nicotinamide is hydrogen
bonded to both Tyr48 and His110 and thus indicates a possible position
for the substrate (Figure 1c). A comparison of the relative pKas of the residues suggests that the lower value of histidine (pKa = 6–7) relative to tyrosine (pKa = 10) would make it a more likely candidate
to donate a proton.9,10 However, the proximity of the
Lys77–Asp43 pair in the binding site has been proposed to lower
the pKa of Tyr48–8.25 through hydrogen
bonding.10

In the literature, there
are several computational studies that
investigate which of the two potential residues is the proton donor.11−13 These include two quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM)
studies, one by Lee and co-workers13 and
the other by Várnai and co-workers,11 and one empirical valence bond (EVB) study by Várnai and
Warshel.12 From the results of the two
QM/MM studies, which are summarized in Table 1, it is evident that they differ in both
their proposed mechanisms and calculated energetics. The results of
Lee and co-workers13 show a concerted mechanism,
whereas Várnai and co-workers reported a stepwise mechanism.11 The difference in the calculated energetics
of the reactions is also significant, with a difference for the calculated
relative energies of around 10 kcal/mol. The experimental activation
free energy, determined from reaction rate studies, is 14.8 kcal/mol.14 Thus, both computational studies overestimate
the activation energy with a relative energy of 21.3 kcal/mol for
Lee and co-workers13 and 31.8 kcal for
Várnai and co-workers.11 Nevertheless,
both studies agree that the reaction mechanism is more favorable with
the His110 model than with the Tyr48 model, as the relative activation
energies in both studies are smaller when employing His110 as the
proton donor.

In
the EVB study from Várnai and Warshel,12 the energy profile was only evaluated for the tyrosine
proton donor hypothesis as their detailed pKa studies on both Tyr48 and His110 suggested that the Tyr48
proton donor hypothesis would be the most probable mechanism. The
activation free energy was calculated to be 17 kcal/mol and thus in
good agreement with experimental results. The better agreement of
the EVB results is not a surprise as the method comprises significant
sampling and is thus able to evaluate free energies that can be directly
compared to experiment results. On the contrary, in the two QM/MM
methods described above, no sampling is included and thus only potential
energies are calculated. Entropic contributions are thus not included
in these original calculations. Although entropic and thermal contributions
can play a significant role in determining transition-state energies,
previous work has shown that the entropic contributions to the activation
energies for some enzyme reactions can be minimal,15 and as such the underlying difference in the quality of
the results between the EVB and QM/MM calculations is not necessarily
due entirely to the exclusion of entropic effects.

Overall,
the opposing nature of the conclusions from these two
QM/MM studies, combined with the low chemical accuracy of the calculated
activation energies, indicates that a more detailed study into this
important mechanism is warranted. In the present work, we have examined
the catalytic mechanism of aldose reductase with a QM/MM approach
employing this time density functional theory (DFT) as the QM methodology.
The structures of transition states (TSs) and intermediates involved
in the reaction, the energy profiles, and the roles of key residues
are presented herein. The detailed interpretation of the catalytic
mechanism that results from this work is helpful for the design of
mechanism-based inhibitors like transition-state analogue or covalent
inhibitors.16 Finally, one of the main
objectives of this work is to determine how the methodological choices
in a QM/MM calculation can have significant effects on both the calculated
energetics and the resulting interpretation of the preferred mechanism.
Therefore, the extent to which using a modern density functional and
a larger QM region can affect previous results, both quantitatively
and qualitatively, is also discussed.

2 Results and Discussion
The proposed
mechanism for the different protonation states is
represented in Scheme 2, and the associated relative energies are shown in Figure 2. To clearly differentiate
the intermediates from the different models, a labeling scheme is
introduced, where the abbreviated name of the model (P for HIP, E
for HIE, and D for HID) precedes the abbreviated name of the intermediate
(R for reactant, TS for transition state, I for intermediate, and
P for product). Thus, we have for example P–R that stands for
reactant of the HIP model. In the following sections, a detailed description
of the three different reaction mechanisms is given.

and (d) superposition of the three intermediates of the reaction (P–R

2.1 Mechanism with HIP110
The results
for the mechanism of GLD reduction by AR in the case of a protonated
histidine show a single-step mechanism with associated activation
energy of 8.1 kcal/mol (Scheme 2a and Figure 2). A schematic representation of the starting enzyme–substrate
(ES) complex (P–R), the transition state (P–TS1), and
the final enzyme–product (EP) complex (P–P), including
only the closest atoms around substrate, is given in Figure 3a–c, respectively.

Significant interactions help to maintain atoms in the ES complex,
P–R, in a suitable position for reactions, namely, H-bonds
between both His110 and Tyr48 hydroxyl group and the carbonyl group
of GLD (H5(His110)···O4(GLD) = 1.83 Å and H6(Tyr48)···O4(GLD)
= 2.02 Å), the H-bond between the NADPH amide group and the 2-hydroxy
of GLD (O8(NADPH)···H9(GLD) = 1.80 Å), and finally
the H-bond between the 3-hydroxy of GLD with a water molecule (H(H2O)···O13(GLD) = 2.15 Å). In the transition
state (characterized by an imaginary frequency of −667 cm–1), the NADPH hydride is approximately halfway between
C1 and C3, the C1···H2 and C3···H2 distances
being 1.45 and 1.26 Å, respectively (Figure 3b). In addition, the comparison of the enzyme–substrate
complex (Figure 3a)
and TS (Figure 3b)
geometries shows the beginning of transition from a planar sp2 to a tetrahedral sp3 for the GLD carboxyl. In
the same way, the donation of the hydride by NADPH makes the nicotinamide
ring become more planar. The TS structure, P–TS1, does not
clearly show whether His110 or Tyr48 is the proton donor: both H5
from His110 and H6 from Tyr48 are now closer to O4 (GLD) (H5(His110)···O4(GLD)
distance is 1.61 Å and H6(Tyr48)···O4(GLD) distance
is 1.83 Å), and these may contribute to the stabilization of
the TS. However, from the product complex (Figure 3c), it is clear that the proton donor is
His110; thus, the role of Tyr48 is stabilizing the incipient negative
charge on the aldehyde group of GLD. From these results, it can be
concluded that the mechanism for the protonated histidine system is
concerted and asynchronous, where the approach of the NADPH hydride
to the carbonyl carbon of GLD triggers the proton transfer. In the
final product complex (EP), the hydride is definitively bonded to
the d-glycerol carbon C3, and the proton H4 from His110 has
been completely transferred to d-glycerol oxygen O4. A strong
hydrogen bond involving H6 of Tyr48 persists, the O4···H6
distance being 1.72 Å.

transition state 1, (c) enzyme–intermediate complex, (d) transition
state 2, and (e) enzyme–product complex (distances shown in
green, atom numbers in brown, and residue names in red).

We examined the possibility of an alternative mechanism
where the
proton transfer (from H5(His110) to O4(GLD)) and the attack of the
hydride on the C3 group occur in two separate steps. In spite of an
extensive search, it was not possible to locate any intermediate corresponding
to the alkoxide and thus the possibility of a two-step nonconcerted
mechanism was discounted. Finally, the mechanism with a proton transfer
from Tyr48 was also intensively investigated, but no transition state
that could lead to a proton transfer from Tyr48 could be identified.

It is also informative to superpose the three stationary points
along the potential energy surface (PES; Figure 3d). The aldehyde hydrogen of the reactant
maintains its location in the TS but is replaced by the NADPH hydride
hydrogen at the product stage. This suggests that the active site
is set up to stabilize a hydrogen at this point and is ideally arranged
for this transformation.

2.2 Mechanism with HIE110
For HIE, the
mechanism is constituted of two steps with an activation energy of
16.0 kcal/mol (Scheme 2b and Figure 2). A
schematic representation of the starting enzyme–substrate complex
(E–R), the two transition states (E–TS1 and E–TS2),
the intermediate (E–I), and the final enzyme–product
complex (E–P), including only the closest atoms around substrate,
is given in Figure 4a–e.

HIE (orange)

intermediates of the d-glyceraldehyde reduction by AR with
HID110 as studied by the QM/MM model: (b) enzyme–substrate
complex, (c) transition state, (d) enzyme–product complex (distances
shown in green, atom numbers in brown, and residue names in red).

The same interactions that help
to maintain atoms in the ES complex
of P–R can be found in E–R. These are hydrogen-bonding
interactions between both His110 and Tyr48 residues and the carbonyl
oxygen of GLD (H5(His110)···O4(GLD) = 1.86 Å and
H6(Tyr48)···O4(GLD) = 1.89 Å) and the interaction
between the amide group of NADPH and the middle hydroxyl group of
GLD (O8(NADPH)···H9 = 1.72 Å) (Figure 4a). A water molecule also stabilizes
the 3-hydroxy of GLD (O13(GLD)···H2O = 2.23
Å). Compared to P–R, E–R is further stabilized
by a supplementary interaction with Trp111 (H11(Trp111)···O10(GLD)
= 2.06 Å) that is not always present in the HIP simulation.

In the transition state, E–TS1 (characterized by an imaginary
frequency of −562 cm–1), the NADPH hydride
transfer from C1 to C3 is nearly completed, the C1···H2
and C3···H2 distances being 1.54 and 1.24 Å, respectively
(Figure 4b). Hydrogens
from Tyr48 and His110 are both almost at the same distance to the
carboxyl oxygen of GLD O4 and closer compared to E–R—the
H5(His110)···O4(GLD) distance was 1.86 Å in E–R
but is 1.69 Å in E–TS1, and the H6(Tyr48)···O4(GLD)
distance was 1.89 Å in E–RE–R but is 1.66 Å
in E–TS1. The H11(Trp111) to O10(GLD) distance is nearly unchanged
from the E–R (2.06 Å) to E–TS1 (2.02 Å). The
interaction between the amide group of NADPH and the 2-hydroxy of
GLD (O8(NADPH)···H9(GLD) = 1.74 Å) is relatively
unchanged at E–TS1 compared to E–R, suggesting that
the function of this interaction is to maintain the position of the
substrate through a consistently strong stabilizing interaction.

The transition from E–I to E–TS is almost barrier-less
with a difference of 0.4 kcal/mol. In the intermediate, E–I,
the NADPH hydride is now completely transferred from C1 to C3 as C3···H2
is 1.13 Å, the distance of a C–H bond. The difference
between His110 and Tyr48 is clear in the intermediate structure as
Tyr48 H6 is closer to the GLD O4 (1.48 Å) than His110 H5 is to
O4 (1.62 Å).

In the second transition state, E–TS2
(characterized by
an imaginary frequency of −305 cm–1), the
hydrogen bonding from Tyr48 and His110 to the GLD carbonyl oxygen
O4 is further differentiated. This proton is partially transferred
from Tyr48 (H6(Tyr48)···O4(GLD) =1.36 Å) compared
to His110, in which the hydrogen bonding remains consistent relative
to I–E (1.62 Å).

In the final EP complex, E–P,
the proton H6 from Tyr48 is
bonded to O4 from GLD. At this stage, a strong interaction is formed
between the formed Tyr48 phenolate and Lys77, going from 1.86 Å
in E–TS2 to 1.65 Å in E–P.

2.3 Mechanism
with HID110
During the
HID110 1 ns MD simulation, a displacement of NADPH occurred (Figure 5a), giving an unproductive
complex and perhaps suggesting that this electronic state is quite
unreactive. To address this issue, the energy profile for HID was
determined with a new 1 ns MD but with restraints on the cofactor
position.

For HID, the eventually identified mechanism is a
concerted one, using Tyr48 as proton donor with an activation energy
of 26 kcal/mol (Scheme 2c and Figure 2). A
schematic representation of the starting enzyme–substrate complex
(D–R), the transition state (D–TS1), and the final enzyme–product
complex (D–P), including only the closest atoms around substrate,
is given in Figure 5b–d.

In the case of HID, there are fewer interactions
that help to maintain
atoms in the ES complex, D–R, in a suitable position for reactions.
As Nε of His110 is deprotonated, no stabilization is possible.
In contrast to the other simulations, no water was observed interacting
with the 3-hydroxy of GLD. As a consequence, the interaction between
the Tyr48 hydroxyl group and O4 of GLD carbonyl group is strong (H6(Tyr48)···O4(GLD)
= 1.69 Å), whereas in P–R and E–R, the hydrogen
bond was longer, 2.02 and 1.89 Å, respectively (cf. Figure 5b, 3a, and 4a). The NADPH hydride is almost
at the same distance from the GLD carboxyl carbon (H2(NADPH)···O4(GLD)
= 2.28 Å) compared to E–R (2.25 Å) but slightly further
compared to P–R (2.00 Å). The hydrogen bond between the
GLD 2-hydroxy and Trp111 is fairly consistent between both D–R
(2.19 Å) and E–R (2.20 Å).

In the transition
state, D–TS1 (characterized by an imaginary
frequency of −875 cm–1), the NADPH hydride
is moving from C1(NADPH) to C3(GLD). The hydride is very close to
completely transferred as the distance to C3 is only 1.20 Å.
The proton from Tyr48 is approximately halfway between O7(Tyr48) and
O4(GLD) (H6···O7(Tyr48) distance is 1.18 Å and
H6(Tyr48)···O4(GLD) distance is 1.26 Å.) Thus,
the mechanism is concerted, indeed almost simultaneous, between the
hydride transfer and the proton transfer.

In the final EP complex,
D–P, the hydride is definitively
bonded to d-glycerol carbon C3, and the proton H6 from Tyr48
has been completely transferred to GLD O4. At this stage, a strong
H-bonding interaction is formed between the phenolate of Tyr48 and
Lys77 (1.44 Å).

2.4 Comparison between the
Three Reaction Models
The calculated activation barriers
for HIP and HIE are of 8.1 and
16.0 kcal/mol, respectively. Thus, from an energetic point of view,
both mechanisms are different. This is all the more true when we average
the results obtained from QM/MM studies on other frames (one additional
for HIP and two for HIE) that we also studied (details of the structures
are provided in the Supporting Information). These gave an average of 6.5 ± 2.2 kcal/mol for HIP and 16.7
± 1.0 kcal/mol for HIE. Also, it should be pointed out that we
are comparing ΔE with ΔG; nevertheless, in these types of reaction, the contribution from
thermal and entropic effects is expected to be small.17 It could be concluded from these results that the mechanism
with the lower activation energy is the more probable one. Nevertheless,
the experimental activation free energy calculated from kinetics constants
is 14.8 kcal/mol.14 Thus, although the
activation energy with the HIP model is lower, the results from the
HIE model are closer to the experimental value. Given the significant
difference (∼10 kcal/mol) between the calculated activation
energies that arises from considering the protonation state of the
histidine, the clear agreement of the HIE model with the experimental
data indicates that the experimental system involves an unprotonated
histidine in the binding site with Tyr48 acting as the proton donor.
These conclusions based on the difference in the calculated activation
barriers are in agreement with the calculation of the pKa of the residues, which has been done by Várnai
and Warshel12 that yielded an estimated
pKa of 8.5 for Tyr48 and a remarkably
low value of 0.9 for His110. The study of the HID model gave a much
higher energy barrier of 26.5 kcal/mol. The difference in the results
of HIE and HID models demonstrates that the presence of a proton on
Nε of His110 is required for the correct positioning of GLD.

2.5 Effect of Basis Set Size and QM Region Size
The goal of this work was to obtain an updated QM/MM model for
the reduction of GLD by AR to determine both the mechanism of reaction
and the effect that a different QM/MM methodology can have on the
outcome of results. To reach that goal, we have used a more accurate
QM treatment and a larger QM zone. Thus, in the following, the current
results are compared to those from previous studies.

Our HIP
model can be compared to the results obtained by Lee and co-workers,13 and our HIE model, to the results obtained by
Várnai and co-workers.11 To help
the comparison, energies from both studies and this work are summarized
in Table 2. The structural
characteristics were very similar to previous studies and are thus
described in the Supporting Information.

From an energetic point of view, the results differ significantly.
For the HIE model, there is notable difference in the activation energy
between the work of Várnai and co-workers11 (41.2 kcal/mol) and this work (16.0 kcal/mol), a difference
of 25.2 kcal/mol. From the experimental activation free energy calculated
from kinetics constants of 14.8 kcal/mol, we know that our model is
in better agreement.14

For the HIP
model, the individual influence of the QM treatment
and the QM size is summarized in Table 3.

In the study by
Lee and co-workers, the relative energy to the
reactant of the TS for the His110 proton donor model, obtained using
4-31G, was 21.2 kcal/mol.13 From our results,
we can see that the use of the more accurate B3LYP/6-31G* method has
significantly changed the calculated relative energies as we obtained
an activation energy of 7.5 kcal/mol, 13.7 kcal/mol smaller than that
obtained by the HF/4-31G method. The combination of B3LYP/6-31G* and
a larger QM region did not significantly alter the activation energy
(7.5 kcal/mol for the smaller region and 8.1 kcal/mol for the larger
region). However, the effect on the relative energy of the product
to the reactant (−6.0 kcal/mol for the smaller region and −17.7
for the larger region) was more substantial. Overall, the results
show that a meaningful gain in accuracy for the comparison of the
two potential reaction mechanisms is due mostly to the developments
in accuracy and efficiency of QM methods.

3 Conclusions
Since 1992 and the first suggestion of His110 and Tyr48 as potential
proton donors, there has been a long history of debate on the catalytic
mechanism of AR.7,18 Nevertheless, the common opinion
seemed to favor the Tyr48 proton donor mainly because of crystallographic
and mutagenesis data.10,19−22

Nevertheless, two previous
QM/MM methodologies (using CHARMM2223/HF
4-31G and CHARMM2223/AM124) have failed to validate the Tyr48
hypothesis. Furthermore, they have also given different results between
them for the proposed mechanism: one predicted a concerted mechanism,
whereas the other predicted a stepwise mechanism. Using a different
force field and QM method (OPLS2005 and B3LYP25,26/6-31G*27) and a bigger QM region, the
mechanism was reevaluated. For the first time, a different mechanism
is suggested depending on the protonation state of His110. With HIP
as protonation state for His110, the results show an average activation
energy of 6.5 ± 2.2 kcal/mol and evidence for a highly asynchronous
concerted mechanism with His110 as proton donor. With HIE, the mechanism
is different, as results show an average activation energy of 16.7
± 1.0 kcal/mol and evidence for a stepwise mechanism using Tyr48
as proton donor. Preliminary MD simulation on HID indicates that this
protonation state is unreactive and shows the importance of a proton
on Nε of His110 for the reaction to occur as this residue is
implicated in the positioning of the substrate prior to the reaction.
Our results demonstrate that the HIP and HIE model mechanisms are
significantly different in energy and that only the HIE model is in
good agreement with experimental data—confirming that Tyr48
is the most probable proton donor. Finally, the effect of using modern
DFT methods for the QM/MM calculation was evaluated by comparing our
results to those of previous studies. We found that the changes in
energetics can be substantially affected by the choice of methods
and, importantly, the size of the QM site (particularly for the relative
energy of the reactants and products).

enzyme that has a resolution of 1.65 Å.7 Although there are many other available crystal structures, this
provided a convenient point of reference, as the structure was used
in the previous QM/MM studies by Lee and co-workers.13 The structure includes the cofactor NADP, so this was transformed
into the reacting form NADPH. The “structure preparation”
module of molecular operating environment28 was used to prepare the structure: missing hydrogens were added,
orientated, and the protonation states of residues were optimized.

Particular attention was paid to His110 because, at physiological
pH, histidine can exhibit three different protonation states: HIP
(protonated Nε and Nδ), HIE (protonated Nε), and
HID (protonated Nδ) (Scheme 3).29,30 Within a protein, standard pKa values of residues can be more or less influenced
by the environment and that makes the prediction of the residues’
protonation state less straightforward. Different methods exist to
predict the pKa of residues, but results
from these prediction are not always reliable.31 In this case, we have not attempted to do a QM/MM pKa prediction, rather the initial calculation
of the protonation states was carried out with the empirical modeling
program PROPKA.32 However, the calculated
protonation states from this program were found to be unreliable for
the system under study. As such, all possible protonation states for
the histidine residue involved in the mechanism were evaluated.Scheme 3 Different
Protonation States of Histidine


d-Glyceraldehyde (GLD) was chosen as the
ligand, to be
consistent with the reference studies.11,13 The accuracy
of the MM force-field parameters associated to GLD was tested by performing
various conformational searches and minimizations with MacroModel.33 The consistency of the bonds and angles of the
resulting structures was checked using Mogul.34 As the crystal structure did not contain any ligand, GLD was added
manually. To ensure that the re face of the carbonyl
of GLD would be able to receive the hydride from the NADPH, the carbonyl
oxygen of GLD was positioned within the range of hydrogen-bonding
interactions with the Nε hydrogen of His110 and the hydroxyl
of Tyr48. To get an adequate pose, an optimization with constraints
on the distances of these hydrogens bonds was run to reproduce the
distances from the Michaelis complex (MC) described by Lee and co-workers.13 After having deleted all crystal waters, the
system was solvated in a 10 Å orthorhombic box of water using
the system builder panel of Desmond.35,36 TIP4P37 was chosen as the model for the waters. Finally,
to neutralize the system, three sodium atoms were added randomly for
the HIP model and four for both HIE and HID models.

The three
model systems were gradually relaxed using a standard
protocol implemented in Desmond.35,36 This protocol
comprises a series of minimizations and molecular dynamics, starting
from a system where only hydrogens and the solvent are free to move
as the system is gradually relaxed. A molecular dynamics (MD) simulation
was performed for 1 ns using Desmond35,36 to relax further
the system and to obtain a variety of snapshots for the QM/MM calculations.
The NPT ensemble was used for the simulation with the Martyna, Tuckerman,
and Klein method.38 The temperature was
kept fixed at 300 K. The cutoff radius for the nonbonded interactions
(Coulombic and van der Waals) was fixed at 9.0 Å without any
special treatment of interactions at the cutoff. The long-range Coulombic
interactions in the simulation were treated by a smooth particle mesh
Ewald method with a tolerance value of 1 nm.39 At the end of the MD simulation, the average value, the standard
deviation, and the slope of different properties (potential energy,
pressure, temperature, and volume) were calculated and analyzed to
confirm that the MD simulation was at equilibrium.

To obtain
an averaged energy barrier, a minimum of two snapshots
per model, with suitable hydrogen bonding between GLD and both His110
and Tyr48, were extracted from the MD output and prepared for QM/MM
calculations. The selected snapshots were then MM minimized to return
the system to 0 K using the truncated Newton method40 implemented in Impact.41 A second
MM minimization using the Polak–Ribiere conjugate gradient42 method implemented in MacroModel33 was used to reproduce the distances from the
Michaelis complex described by Lee and co-workers.13 All of the minimizations were done with waters’
oxygen atoms kept constrained. These postequilibration minimized structures,
which represent the enzyme–substrate (ES) complex, were used
as starting structures for the QM/MM calculations.

4.2 QM/MM Methodology
In previous QM/MM
studies by Lee and co-workers13 and Várnai
and co-workers,11 the choice of the QM
region for both studies includes all hypothetical reacting species
(d-glyceraldehyde, NADPH, His110, and Tyr48) and influential
residues (Asp43 and Lys77).18 An increase
in accuracy can be expected if the size of the QM region is extended;43,44 currently, QM/MM calculations can readily account for up to 100
atoms in the QM region,45 so performing
calculations on the upper side of this range could thus be considered.
The QM treatment was done at an ab initio level (HF/4-31G) by Lee
and co-workers13 and at a semiempirical
level (AM1)24 by Várnai and co-workers.11 Although issues such as boundary effects, the
classical potential, and optimization strategies may all affect calculated
results, in this comparison, the difference between the QM treatment
of the system could be the main reason for lack of accuracy in the
previous results. As such, this hypothesis will be tested in the current
work. Ideally, one would perform all QM calculations with the most
accurate ab initio method, together with the largest available basis
set.46 The most generally reliable and
routinely used QM treatment in current QM/MM studies is DFT, particularly
with the B3LYP functional.25,45

To study the
reaction, a hybrid QM/MM Hamiltonian was employed using QSite.47−49 For the classical region (MM), the OPLS_200550 force field was used to describe the protein. The QM region
was modeled at the B325LYP26,51/6-31G*27 level of theory. The effect
of the size of the QM region was examined using two different QM regions
on the HIP model. The first QM region was defined as in the study
by Lee and co-workers.13 This QM region
with a total of 54 atoms is represented in Figure 6a. A larger QM/MM partitioning, as defined
in Figure 6b, was also used in the three models (HIP,
HIE, and HID). In this second partitioning, the same residues are
included, but the QM/MM frontier is positioned differently. First,
the entire side chains of residues were included by cutting between
Cα and Cβ. Second, the frontier within NADPH was extended
by adding the ribose part of NADPH, allowing a cut between two carbons
rather than between a carbon and a nitrogen atom, consistent with
the best practice for the positioning of link atoms.52 The QM/MM partitioning 2 thus had a total of 90 atoms included
for the HIP model and 89 atoms for both HIE and HID models.Figure 6 QM/MM partitioning
(a) 1 and (b) 2. The QM region is shown in green,
and the yellow dots represent link atom positions.



To be consistent with the reference study,
the link atom approach
was used to saturate the valence of the QM/MM frontiers.13,53 To avoid overpolarization of QM atoms by MM atoms to the boundary,
Gaussian charge distributions were used to represent the potential
of the atoms within two covalent bonds of the QM/MM cut-site using
the Gaussian grid method for hydrogen cap electrostatics in QSite.54 MM point charges were employed for the rest
of the MM region.

All atoms beyond 10 Å from the reactant
were consistently
kept constrained during the QM/MM simulations to speed up the calculations.
The equilibrated ES complex was optimized with QM/MM calculations.
The potential energy surface (PES) for the reaction was explored starting
from this optimized structure of the reactant. Transition states (TS)
were identified by means of a micro/macroiteration scheme, with all
pure MM atoms being adiabatically minimized at each TS search step.55 This TS search calculation was done in QSite47,48 using the standard method. This takes an initial guess of the TS
as input and tries to find the closest saddle point to it. The initial
guess was built by small modifications of the optimized structure
of the reactant, the goal being to make it resemble as much as possible
the believed transition state. To do so, the reacting bond C1–H2
(the carbon–hydride bond of the NADPH) was elongated manually
to position the hydride halfway between the C1 carbon, where the hydride
is initially attached, and the GLD carbonyl carbon C3. The carboxyl
double bond of the GLD was also elongated to mimic the transition
from a carbonyl double bond to an alcohol single bond. Also, to help
the TS search process, QSite allows one to indicate as an input what
bonds are supposed to be made or broken. This was done by adding a
connect section to the input file, where C1–H2 hydride bond
was defined as the reaction coordinate. To find the reactant and product
associated with this saddle point, the TS was minimized at the same
level of theory. The nature of the structures was confirmed from the
analysis of the Hessian.
