In recent years, rare-earth-doped
nanophosphors have attracted
great attention in the field of luminescent materials for advanced
solid-state lighting and high-resolution display applications. However,
the low efficiency of concurrent red phosphors creates a major bottleneck
for easy commercialization of these devices. In this work, intense
red-light-emitting K+-codoped BaAl2O4:Eu3+ nanophosphors having an average crystallite size
of 54 nm were synthesized via a modified sol–gel method. The
derived nanophosphors exhibit strong red emission produced by the 5D0 → 7FJ (J = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4) transitions of Eu3+ upon UV and low-voltage electron beam excitation. Comparative photoluminescence
(PL) analysis is executed for Eu3+-activated and K+-coactivated BaAl2O4:Eu3+ nanophosphors, demonstrating remarkable enhancement in PL intensity
as well as thermal stability due to K+ codoping. The origin
of this PL enhancement is also analyzed from first-principles calculations
using density functional theory. Achievement of charge compensation
with the addition of a K+ coactivator plays an important
role in increasing the radiative lifetime and color purity of the
codoped nanophosphors. Obtained results substantially approve the
promising prospects of this nanophosphor in the promptly growing field
of solid-state lighting and field emission display devices.

1 Introduction
The ever-growing impact of solid-state lighting technology on household
usage in the form of white-light-emitting diodes (WLEDs) and high-resolution
displays has, in recent times, initiated a pan-global hunt for improvement
and optimization of brightness and color purity. WLEDs, the fourth-generation
lighting source, are already exhibiting phenomenal advantages in efficiency,
operational lifetime, form factor, and environmental impact and are
well on the way to replace incandescent and fluorescent lights.1−3 Most widely deployed protocols to develop WLEDs adopt a “phosphor
conversion” route, i.e., yellow-emitting Y3Al5O12:Ce3+ (YAG:Ce) phosphor is coated
on a blue-emitting (460 nm) InGaN chip to mix yellow and blue light
for generating white light. However, most of the current-generation
WLEDs, even though called “white”, in effect, emit “cool
white” light with low color rendering index (CRI < 80) and
high correlated color temperature (CCT ∼ 7750 K)4,5 because of the lack of red components in their spectra, which further
limits their widespread commercialization for indoor lighting purposes.
To circumvent this problem, an alternate route is designed, which
incorporates a combination of near-ultraviolet (n-UV) light-emitting
diode (LED) chip (340–420 nm) with red, green, and blue phosphors
that can collectively produce white light.6,7 However,
the subpar efficiency of the present-generation red phosphors creates
a major bottleneck for their easy deployment for commercial purposes.8 To tackle this problem, currently, a great deal
of research effort is being directed to developing highly luminescent
red phosphors that can be efficiently excited in the n-UV regime.

A recent development that has revolutionized the domain of solid-state
lighting technology is the so-called nanophosphors. It is well established
that by reducing the size of a crystallite, novel surface electronic
states can be engineered. These surface states can drastically alter
the optical properties, especially when the dimension of the crystallites
encroaches the nanoregime. Because the intensity of scattered light
is directly proportional to the sixth power of particle diameter,
nanophosphors demonstrate less scattering loss of emitted radiation
as compared to that in bulk phosphors when utilized in an LED device,
leading to an enhanced external quantum efficiency.9,10 Also,
it is well reported that films containing nanophosphors show greater
transmittance than that from those containing bulk phosphors,9 which is very much beneficial for extracting
an efficient emission output. Moreover, decreasing particle size also
has an additional, much sought-after, effect, as in the nanoform,
they can be coated over a substrate significantly higher times than
their bulk counterparts to achieve a desired phosphor layer thickness.
This results in meticulous control over thickness as well as homogeneity,
which is a key perquisite for developing next-generation technology
such as even higher resolution displays. Consequently, in the recent
times, search for newer and novel nanophosphors is occupying a prime
slot in both experimental and theoretical materials science. Recent
developments in this emerging field have established a low-temperature
protocol for realizing rare-earth-doped nanophosphors, which further
highlights their versatility in contrast to that of the bulk phosphors.
Continuing along this direction, in the current work, we aim to design
a suitable, highly luminescent red nanophosphor with enhanced brightness
and stability to address the aforementioned problems.

Till date,
the most prevalent protocols to realize brilliant luminescence
involve rare-earth (RE) element-based activators11−13 as the partly
occupied 4f orbitals of RE ions are largely screened from the contiguous
chemical surroundings by completely occupied 5s and 5p orbitals. Consequently,
the luminescence originating from the 4f → 4f transition usually
consists of sharp lines with comparatively high lifetimes. Following
this route, the de facto choice for realizing bright red luminescence
is a Eu3+ activator as its all emission peaks lie in the
red region of the visible spectra. Thus, the characteristic 5D0 → 7F2 transition of trivalent
europium (Eu3+) is currently the most exploited protocol
to achieve highest-quality red phosphors and is utilized extensively
in numerous commercial applications ranging from display to solid-state
lighting. However, it must be noted that the nature of this transition
line strongly depends on the local environment and site symmetry;
hence, locating a suitable host material that can facilitate extraction
of rich luminescence from the activator constructs the next important
phase of the problem.

The most significant role in modulating
the brightness of a phosphor
is played by migration of energy from the host to the RE activator;
thus, a host system with a large band gap and lower vibrational energy
is incumbent to design the optimum solution.14,15 Following the above mandate, among a huge abundance of inorganic
hosts, alkaline earth aluminates demand a closer scrutiny owing to
various indigenous advantages such as low chemical toxicity and high
thermal and chemical stabilities.16,17 Specifically,
BaAl2O4 is a noteworthy material in this context
for its excellent pyroelectric and dielectric properties and its suitability
toward coating as well as refractory applications.18,19 Most importantly, the wide band gap (∼4 eV) of BaAl2O4 ensures negligible absorption in the visible region
and thereby minimizes emission loss, rendering it an ideal sensitizer
in nanophosphors. The stable crystal structure of BaAl2O4 is another advantage of using this material as a host.
BaAl2O4 belongs to the family of stuffed tridymites.
In the tridymite structure, the distorted AlO4 tetrahedral
clusters share the corners, which connect together to form six-membered
rings. Ba2+ cations are situated inside the channels of
this structure.20 These Ba2+ sites construct highly suitable sites for Eu3+ doping
as (a) their lower symmetry is highly favorable for the Eu3+ 4f → 4f transition and (b) the ionic radii of Eu3+ is comparable to that of Ba2+. Hence, motivated by these
favorable aspects, till now, various research groups have attempted
to develop rare-earth-doped BaAl2O4 nanophosphors
using various synthesis protocols. There are quite a few such reports
regarding Eu2+ doping in BaAl2O4 nanophosphors;16,17,21,22 however, reports of successful doping of Eu3+ in a BaAl2O4 matrix are remarkably sparse. Wiglusz et al.
had recently adopted a sol–gel method for developing Eu3+-doped BaAl2O4 nanophosphors and investigated
their structural changes and luminescence properties;23 however, the maximum photoluminescence (PL) brightness
obtained by them is still not up to the mark and leaves much to be
desired.

A highly effective strategy to improving the PL brightness
in a
case like the above might lie in codoping alkali metal ions along
with the rare-earth ions in the nanophosphor matrix. The rationale
behind this approach can be elaborated as follows: Doping only rare-earth
ions imparts a charge imbalance in the crystal; however, concurrent
doping of alkali metal ions actively counteracts the charge imbalance.
This approach had been successfully employed by various research groups
recently, which yielded significant improvement of the PL brightness
for various types of rare-earth-doped nanophosphors.24−27 In the current work, following the above strategy, we have synthesized
BaAl2O4:Eu3+ nanophosphors by the
sol–gel route and investigated photoluminescence properties
by varying the K+ coactivator concentration, which, to
the best of our knowledge, hitherto have not been attempted.

2 Experimental Section
2.1 Synthesis of BaAl2O4:Eu3+ and K+-Codoped BaAl2O4:Eu3+ Nanophosphors
The customized
Pechini-type
sol–gel route was adopted to synthesize Ba(1–x)Al2O4:Eux (x = 0, 0.005, 0.01, 0.02, 0.05, 0.07)
and Ba(1–x–y)Al2O4:Eux, Ky (x = 0.05, y = 0.01, 0.02, 0.03, 0.04, 0.05) nanophosphors. The actual synthesis
procedure is parallel to the one mentioned in our earlier report.28 The precursors used for the synthesis were Ba(NO3)2 (Merck 99.9%), Al(NO3)3·9H2O (Merck, 99.9%), Eu(NO3)3 (prepared by making a solution of Eu2O3 (Sigma-Aldrich
99.99%) in HNO3), KNO3, citric acid (Merck 99.9%),
and ethylenediamine (Merck 99.9%), all of which were of analytical
reagent grade. The typical synthesis procedure is described below.

Initially, stoichiometrically weighed barium nitrate, aluminum
nitrate, europium nitrate, and potassium nitrate were dissolved in
35 mL of deionized water and the solution was stirred in a magnetic
stirrer for 1 h. Then, the aqueous solution of citric acid was added
dropwise to the prepared metal nitrate solution in Cit3–/(Ba2+ + Al3+) = 1 molar ratio and then again
stirred in a magnetic stirrer for another 30 min to make a homogeneous
transparent solution. Afterward, ethylenediamine was added in the
transparent solution to adjust the pH to 6. The solution was then
put in a water bath and slowly evaporated, which converted it into
a highly viscous colloidal gel. In the next step, the gel was dried
in an oven at 120 °C overnight and then calcined at 700 °C
for 6 h for removing the organics. At last, the porous material was
ground using a mortar and annealed at 1000 °C for 5 h in a muffle
furnace to obtain ultrafine Eu3+- and K+-doped
BaAl2O4 powders. For Eu3+-doped BaAl2O4 nanophosphors, we have followed the same process
except KNO3 was not added in that case.

2.2 Characterization
The phase purity
and structural parameters of the as-synthesized samples were investigated
through X-ray diffraction (XRD), with a Rigaku-Ultima-III X-Ray powder
diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5404 Å).
The Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra were recorded using
a Shimadzu IRPrestige-21 spectrometer in the mid-IR wavenumber range,
i.e., 4000–400 cm–1. The shape and crystalline
structure of the nanocrystals were analyzed with high-resolution transmission
electron microscopy (HRTEM, JEOL JEM 2100). The morphologies of the
sample were investigated by FESEM Hitachi S-4800. Diffuse reflectance
spectra were acquired using a Shimadzu 3600 UV–vis–NIR
spectrophotometer with BaSO4 as a reference. The steady-state
photoluminescence spectra were recorded on JASCO FP-8300, whereas
the time-resolved photoluminescence spectra were recorded on an Edinburgh
FLSP-980 luminescence spectrometer using a microsecond flash lamp
as the source of excitation. The absolute photoluminescence quantum
yield of the nanophosphors was measured using a 120 mm diameter integrating
sphere whose inner face is coated with BENFLEC for sufficient scattering
of incoming light, as supplied by Edinburgh instruments. The quantum
efficiency (η) can be calculated using the following expression  where LS is the
emission spectrum of the sample and ES and ER the spectra of the excitation
light with and without the sample in the integrating sphere, respectively.
Cathodoluminescence (CL) spectra were recorded using a Gatan Mono
CL3 device attached to the field emission scanning electron microscope
with a beam accelerating voltage of 5 kV.

All first-principles
calculations were carried out using the Vienna Ab initio Simulation
Package (VASP).29a−29d The ion cores were described using the projector-augmented wave
(PAW) method,29e,29f and the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof
(PBE)29g,29h functional within the generalized gradient
approximation (GGA) was used to describe the exchange and correlation
terms. Plane wave basis up to an energy cut off of 400 eV was utilized
in all calculations. Because the current computations involve fairly
large supercells, a Γ point centered, 2 × 2 × 2 k point grid was deployed to perform Brillouin zone integrations.
During structural optimization, all systems were allowed to fully
relax until the change in the total (free) energies was smaller than
1 × 10–3 eV. Bader charge analysis29i was used to quantitatively estimate the charge
transfer between various species.

A 2 × 2 × 2 supercell
of pristine BaAl2O4 (space group P6322 (D6-6),
IT#: 182) containing 16 Ba, 32
Al, and 64 O atoms (relaxed lattice parameters: a = 10.047 Å, b = 10.047 Å, c = 17.957 Å) was used as the initial system in which substitution
of one Ba atom amounted to 6.250% of doping. Subsequently, in the
above structure, (a) one Ba atom was substituted by a Eu atom and
(b) two adjacent Ba atoms were substituted by a Eu and a K atom and
fully (both atomic coordinates and lattice vectors) relaxed to obtain
the Eu-doped and Eu–K-codoped BaAl2O4 structures. For the doped and codoped systems, while describing
the Eu atoms, [Kr] 4d10 was considered as the core and
the shell 5s25p64f76s2 containing 17 electrons was considered as the valance shell to facilitate
delocalization of the Eu f orbital. To ensure fast convergence in
these cases, one-center PAW charge densities up to l = 3 were passed through the charge density mixer and smaller mixing
parameters were used.

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Structural, Compositional, and Microstructural
Analysis
The XRD patterns of BaAl2O4:Eu3+ and BaAl2O4:Eu3+, K+ nanophosphors are presented in Figure 1a,c, respectively. The peak positions and
intensities are in good agreement with the ICDD PDF card no. 17-0306,
which are indexed as (201), (202), (220), (222), (004), (402), (204),
(224), and (422) in Figure 1a,c. There are no impurity peaks in the XRD pattern, which
confirms the construction of a single-phase tridymite structure with
space group P6322. The best way to visualize this kind
of stuffed tridymite structure is a three-dimensional framework of
corner-sharing distorted Al–O4 tetrahedra, which
is shown in Figure 1d. Ba2+ cations take the position within this ring of
such six tetrahedral networks. From Figure 1b, it can be noted that because of the increase
in Eu3+ concentration the (202) XRD peaks shift toward
a higher angle side. Generally, Eu3+ occupies the position
of Ba2+ in the BaAl2O4 lattice and
the ionic radii of Ba2+ and Eu3+ are 1.36 and
0.95 Å, respectively. Hence, during substitution of Eu3+ in Ba2+ sites, the unit cell shrinks, leading to the
shift of XRD peak toward a higher 2θ value.30,31 Doping of a Eu3+ ion in the Ba2+ site creates
Ba2+ vacancies in the crystal, resulting in a charge imbalance
problem. The obtained higher angle shift in the XRD peak can also
be evidenced from the calculated values of lattice parameters (a,b,c) and unit cell volume (V) detailed
in Table 1. For all
compositions, the crystallite size of the prepared phosphors sticks
within the range of 45–60 nm, ensuring the formation of crystals
in the nanoscale regime.

BaAl2O4:5% Eu3+, 5% K+	0.147	60	10.452	8.818	834.23	
Table 1 also illustrates
that with the increasing K+ doping concentration the crystallite
size and lattice parameter increase gradually up to 4% and then decreases
for 5%. However, FWHM of the (202) peak follows opposite trend i.e.
up to 4% codoping it decreases and then increases for 5% K+ addition. Because of almost similar ionic radii of K+ and Ba2+ (1.38 and 1.36 Å, respectively),32 K+ efficiently substitutes Ba2+ in the BaAl2O4 lattice. This substitution
easily eliminates Ba2+ vacancies from the crystal created
as a result of the charge imbalance problem induced by the doping
of Eu3+ in Ba2+ sites. Consequently, defects
are reduced inside the crystal and crystallization is enhanced. Thus,
curtailing of FWHM of the (202) XRD peak with an increase in K+ concentration clearly implies that K+ acts as
a self-promoter for the improved crystallization of the Eu3+:BaAl2O4 lattice. Furthermore, a slightly high
ionic radius of K+ as compared to that of Ba2+ leads to the expansion of unit cell, which effectively increases
the crystallite size of the nanophosphors after codoping. The occurrence
of this unit cell expansion can be traced from a gradual lower angle
shift of the (202) XRD peak with the increasing concentration of K+ in the codoped nanophosphors (shown in Figure S1 of SI). However, the enriched crystallization sustains
up to a particular K+ concentration (4% in the current
work), and beyond this, further substitution of Ba2+ by
K+ becomes very difficult. Thus, again charge imbalance
is created and these surplus K+ ions generate defects in
the system, which eventually reduce the crystallinity of the nanophosphors.
Moreover, incorporation of K+ in the site of Ba2+ always gives rise to oxygen vacancies in the BaAl2O4 lattice. Beyond 4% concentration of K+, several
oxygen vacancies are created in the crystal, which are also responsible
for the decrease in crystallinity of the nanophosphor. This observed
degradation of crystallinity with substitution of alkaline metal ions
in high concentration is also evident in prior studies with different
hosts.33,28 Analysis of FTIR spectra (shown in Figure S2, SI) also confirms the formation of
pure-phase K+-codoped BaAl2O4:Eu3+ nanophosphors. The presence of sharp peaks within 500–900
cm–1 and at 1443 cm–1 corresponding
to the stretching-mode vibrations of the AlO4 unit confirms
the formation of the BaAl2O4 tridymite structure.34

Because the regular morphology and enhanced
crystallinity of the
host–activator system result in efficient energy transfer from
the host to the activator, in the present work, we have analyzed microstructural
characteristics of the nanophosphors. The TEM and HRTEM images of
the K+-codoped BaAl2O4:Eu3+ nanophosphor are shown in Figure 1e,f. The low-magnification TEM image demonstrates a
rodlike structure of the nanophosphors with a diameter of ∼35–40
nm and length of ∼500–600 nm, which is in well correspondence
with the field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) image
of the sample, as shown in Figure S3 in
SI. A closer observation also reveals that the surface of each nanorod
also consists of tiny one-dimensional nanostructures (shown in Figure 1f), developed due
to the secondary growth of the nanocrystals. The typical HRTEM image
clearly shows well-resolved lattice fringes with the estimated interplanar
spacing of 0.342 nm, which is consistent with the (202) plane of K+-codoped BaAl2O4:Eu3+ nanophosphors
with the hexagonal stuffed tridymite structure.

X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS) is an imperative technique
for probing the chemical composition of the developed nanophosphors.
The X-ray photoelectron spectra of the synthesized nanophosphors are
presented in Figure 2. Each spectrum has been charge-corrected using the C 1s line at
284.6 eV, which appeared due to the presence of adventitious carbon
on the sample surface during the exposure to atmosphere. The survey
scans of BaAl2O4:Eu3+ and K+-codoped BaAl2O4:Eu3+ nanophosphors
are shown in Figure 2a, which strongly indicate the presence of Ba, Al, O, and Eu in every
synthesized nanophosphor. In addition to that, the presence of K is
also detected in the survey scan of the codoped nanophosphor. Moreover,
the confirmation of the exact valence state of each constituent element
was probed through its corresponding high-resolution (HR) scan. Figure 2b represents the
high-resolution spectra of the Eu 3d core level for the K+-codoped BaAl2O4:Eu3+ nanophosphor.
The HR scan consists of two strong core-level peaks at 1164.5 and
1134.6 eV, which can be designated as spin–orbit splitting
components Eu 3d3/2 and Eu 3d5/2, respectively.
The binding energy difference between these two peaks of Eu 3d is
in good agreement with the earlier reports, confirming the presence
of the 3+ valence state of Eu ions in the synthesized nanophosphors.35 The presence of monovalent K is also evident
from the HR scan of K 2p, which shows distinct spin–orbit splitting
components of 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 at 291.6 and 295.14
eV, respectively (shown in Figure 2c).36 Besides that for the
activator and coactivator, the analysis of the HR scan is also carried
out for other elements such as Ba, Al, and O, as shown in Figure S4 of the SI. The presence of spin–orbit
split components in the core-level spectra of Ba 3d and Al 2p having
separations of 15.21 and 1.02 eV confirms the +2 and +3 oxidation
states of Ba and Al in BaAl2O4, respectively.37,38 The characteristic peak of lattice oxygen is also observed in oxygen
1s core-level spectra at 530.4 eV.

3.2 Spectroscopic
Analysis
The steady-state
photoluminescence analysis of the BaAl2O4:Eu3+ and K+-codoped BaAl2O4:Eu3+ nanophosphors was conducted from PL excitation and emission
spectra. Each measurement was carried out by taking identical amount
of samples to estimate the intensity variation depending on the quality
of samples only. Figure 3a represents PL excitation spectra of 5% Eu3+-doped BaAl2O4 and 5% Eu3+- and 4% K+-doped BaAl2O4 nanophosphors, which were recorded
by monitoring the fixed emission of the Eu3+ ion at 614
nm. PL excitation spectra can be categorized into two segments: a
broad peak and few sharp peaks. The observed broad peak at 256 nm
can be directly assigned to the charge transfer band (CTB) arising
due to electron transfer from the O2– (2p) orbital
to the empty 4f orbital in Eu3+.39 Usually, such ligand–metal charge transfer is directly associated
with the covalency between O2– and Eu3+ and the surrounding environment of Eu3+.

(c) Diffuse reflectance spectra of undoped, Eu3+-doped,
and Eu3+–K+-codoped BaAl2O4 nanophosphors. Signature of absorption corresponding to the
Eu3+ f–f transition is shown in the inset.

It was interesting to note that
the intensity of CTB increases
in the case of K+-codoped samples. To find out the origin
of this enhancement, Bader partial charges and charge density differences
were computed using density functional theory. In the case of the
Eu-doped system, the Eu atom is connected to the two neighboring Ba
atoms by six oxygen atoms. The Ba/Eu atoms donate electrons and the
O atoms receive them, rendering +ve and −ve charges to them,
respectively. The calculated Bader partial charges of the Eu, Ba,
and O atoms for this configuration are shown in Figure 4a,b. However, in the codoped system (Figure 4b), the Eu atom is
straddled by a K atom and a Ba atom. Because the number of valence
electrons in the K atom is less than that in the Ba atom, the number
of electrons available for donation is also less. The first implication
of the above can be directly observed in the Bader partial charges
of the bridging O atoms as the Ba–O–Eu linkage has more
negative charges than those of the K–O–Eu linkage. Second,
the O atoms, in the codoped case, try to address this imbalance by
grabbing even more electrons from the Eu atom, rendering more +ve
charge to it. The schematic representation of this charge sharing
is shown in Figure 4c. This also can be directly verified by noting that the Eu atom
has a higher +ve Bader partial charge (+2.00 e) in
the codoped case in contrast to that in the doped case (+1.67 e). The net effect is graphically illustrated in Figure 4d,e by plotting charge
density differences of the doped and codoped systems, respectively,
with respect to pristine BaAl2O4.

Ba–Eu–Ba and (b) K–Eu–Ba configurations.
(c) Schematic illustration of the charge transfer phenomenon. (d,
e) Representation of the charge density difference in the doped and
codoped systems.

In the case of K codoping,
the electron gain region (yellow isosurface)
heavily populates the region between the O and Eu atoms, highlighting
a higher amount of charge transfer between them as a direct consequence
of codoping. Thus, the above not only explains the root cause of enhanced
charge sharing between Eu and O but also underpins the observation
of stronger CTB in Eu3+–K+-codoped nanophosphors
as compared to that in Eu3+-doped counterparts from an
atomistic point of view.

Besides CTB, the excitation spectra
consist of some other sharp
lines in the wavelength range of 350–480 nm, whose appearance
indicates the intraconfigurational 4f–4f transitions of Eu3+ in the BaAl2O4 lattice. Direct excitation
of the Eu3+ ground state to the higher energy levels in
the 4f6 configuration results in these sharp peaks, which
can be indexed as 7F0 → 5D4 (362 nm), 7F0 → 5L7 (380 nm), 7F0 → 5L6 (394 nm), 7F0 → 5D3 (415 nm), and 7F0 → 5D2 (464 nm) transitions. The whole excitation spectra
follow a common trend, i.e., K+ codoping facilitates the
increase in the intensity, which in turn amplifies the PL emission
intensity also. The presence of strong peaks at 394 and 464 nm evidently
validates the potential of the nanophosphor, which can be excited
by both near-UV and blue LED chips. The excitation spectra are also
found to be well corroborated with the diffuse reflectance spectra
shown in Figure 3c.
The signature of the f–f transition and CTB is again well identified
in the reflectance spectra. The high reflectance value (∼95%)
at higher wavelengths for both Eu3+-doped and Eu3+–K+-codoped nanophosphors strongly validates the
brilliance of the synthesized samples.40 The optical band gaps of the produced nanophosphors were estimated
from the absorption spectra by employing the Kubelka–Munk function,
as mentioned in earlier reports,41 and
the plots are shown in Figure S5. The band
gaps of all of the samples were found to be greater than 3.2 eV, which
is one of the most important criteria for a good phosphor. The observed
decrease in band gap for the codoped nanophosphor is a consequence
of the minor increase in crystallite size, as evidenced from Table 1.42

The room temperature PL emission spectra of BaAl2O4:Eu3+ and K+-codoped BaAl2O4:Eu3+ nanophosphors, excited at 394
nm, are
presented in Figure 5a,b, respectively. Usually, it is seen that Eu3+ replaces
nine coordinated Ba2+ in the BaAl2O4 lattice (also clear from Figure 1d). Such a coordination environment generates a strong
crystal field over Eu3+, and the energy levels of Eu3+ get split consequently. Therefore, the PL emission spectra
of both Eu3+ and Eu3+–K+-codoped
nanophosphors comprise sharp lines within the 580–720 nm wavelength
region. Mainly, five peaks are observed at 577, 590, 614, 654, and
702 nm, which can be attributed to the 5D0 → 7Fj (0–4) transitions of Eu3+ ions,
respectively. Among these transitions, 5D0 → 7F1 lines arise due to the magnetic dipole (MD)
transition, whereas 5D0 → 7F2 lines originate from the electric dipole (ED) transition.
In general, the MD transitions do not depend on the site symmetry
of the Eu3+ ions in the BaAl2O4 lattice.
However, the ED transitions are hypersensitive and the PL emission
intensity is hugely influenced by the site symmetry of Eu3+ ions in the host lattice. Also, it is well known that the ED transition
dominates the PL spectra if Eu3+ occupies noninversion
symmetric sites in the host lattice. Actually, the distorted Al–O4 tetrahedral network around Ba sites in BaAl2O4 creates large structural asymmetry.43 As Eu3+ occupies these noninversion symmetric sites,
the ED transition dominates and, as a consequence of this, the 614
nm peak turns out to be the most pronounced in all doped and codoped
samples.

Figure 5 PL emission spectra of (a) BaAl2O4:xEu3+ nanophosphors and (b) BaAl2O4:5% Eu3+, yK+ nanophosphors
measured under 394 nm excitation. The insets in the lower left and
right corners demonstrate the digital images of the samples (BaAl2O4:5% Eu3+ and BaAl2O4:5% Eu3+, 4% K+) kept under a UV lamp
and their corresponding color coordinates, respectively.

The possible luminescence mechanism in doped and
codoped BaAl2O4 nanophosphors is schematically
demonstrated
in Figure 3b. In BaAl2O4, mainly the valence band is formed by oxygen
2p orbitals, whereas the conduction band is composed of the Ba 4d
orbital. Transfer of electronic charge from the O 2p to the Eu 4f
orbital creates strong CTB within the band gap. In this configuration,
the electronic excitation can take place by two alternate mechanisms:
in one process, electrons from the valence band can jump directly
to CTB (256 nm excitation), whereas in another process, they can be
excited to even higher levels of Eu3+ (394 nm excitation).
In both processes, the excited electrons quickly relax to the lowest
excited state of Eu3+ (5D0) via nonradiative
transitions and from there they can make five transitions to the ground
state, giving rise to five lines in the emission spectra at 577, 590,
614, 654, and 702 nm.

From the steady-state PL spectra of the
BaAl2O4:Eu3+ nanophosphor, it is
prominent that the PL intensity
of ED transition increases gradually with the increasing Eu3+ concentration up to 5% and then it decreases for 7%. The nonradiative
energy transfer between same types of RE ions is responsible for this
type of concentration quenching phenomenon. It is already well known
that nonradiative energy transfer can occur due to either exchange
interaction or multipole–multipole interaction.44 For exchange interaction, if the Eu3+ concentration is such that the distance between two neighboring
Eu3+ ions is adequately low, the nonradiative relaxation
increases due to increased interaction between two identical Eu3+ ions and the PL intensity decreases consequently.

The critical distance (RC) between
the RE activator ions can be directly calculated by employing the
Blasse equation, which can be expressed as45  where V is the unit cell
volume, c is the optimum concentration of the activator
ion, and N is the number of ions present in the unit
cell. In the current investigation, for the BaAl2O4 host, the value of critical distance, RC, was found to be 10.71 Å (by taking N = 6, c = 0.05, and V = 830.75).
As this RC value is greater than 5 Å,
it is confirmed that the exchange interaction between Eu3+ ions is not responsible for the phenomenon of concentration quenching,
rather multipolar interaction is responsible for it.46

3.2.1 Effects of K+ Doping
The successive change in the emission spectra as a consequence of
K+ codoping is depicted in Figure 5b. For all of the codoped samples, the Eu3+ concentration was kept fixed at 5%. Emission spectra of
codoped nanophosphors reveal no changes in the peak position when
the concentration of K+ was varied from 1 to 5%; however,
as compared to that of the Eu3+-doped samples, a significant
hike in the emission intensity is observed in the codoped nanophosphors.
A careful observation of the emission spectra also discloses that
as the concentration of K+ is increased from 1 to 4% the
PL emission intensity increases gradually and beyond this concentration
the emission intensity decreases. In fact, the 4% K+-codoped
nanophosphor exhibits almost 2-fold enhancement in the emission intensity
as compared to that of the most intense Eu3+-doped nanophosphor.
For a lucid demonstration of this PL enhancement, the optical images
of the nanophosphors illuminated under a UV lamp are presented in
the left bottom insets of Figure 5a,b. A strong emission over a large area can be easily
identified in the case of 4% K+-codoped BaAl2O4:Eu3+ nanophosphor. Usually, enhanced surface
states of the nanocrystals often reduce the PL intensity in solid
condition due to partial aggregation and energy transfer-mediated
nonradiative recombination.47−49 Therefore, achieving high brightness
in the solid condition defines a crucial benchmark for a good nanophosphor.
From the optical images, it becomes clear that K+ codoping
enhances the PL brightness significantly by overcoming the problems
related to the enhanced surface states.

There are several factors
that are responsible for the enrichment of PL brightness with the
incorporation of K+ in the BaAl2O4:Eu3+ nanophosphor. However, charge compensation plays
the dominant role among them. In the BaAl2O4:Eu3+ nanophosphor, Eu3+ occupies the Ba2+ site. As a result of this kind of substitution, which involves
two ions with different valence states, a net positive charge is developed
in the system. Hence, if the concentration of Eu3+ increases
further beyond the concentration of quenching limit, the repulsive
force among the net positive charges increases so high that further
substitution of Eu3+ ions in the lattice gets strongly
obstructed. As a consequence, the Eu3+ ions start to accumulate
instead of occupying a proper lattice site. These localized accumulation
centers of Eu3+ ions serve as quenching sites, and they
have enough capability to reducing the PL brightness via multipolar-interaction-coupled
energy migration among them. Consequently, to design an electrically
neutral solution, two Eu3+ ions must be incorporated into
the lattice of three Ba2+ ions and thus a Ba2+ vacancy (VBa″) would be generated50−53 by the following reaction: 3BaBa → 2EuBa + VBa″. Ba2+ vacancies generated in
the above process act like defect centers, which diminish the overall
PL intensity due to efficient energy transfer to them from Eu3+.54 An effective countermeasure
for this type of charge imbalance and vacancy generation problem lies
in introducing alkali metal ions together with the rare-earth activators.
For example, by incorporating K+ ions in the BaAl2O4:Eu3+ lattice, charge balance can be readily
achieved by the following equation: 2VBa″ + Eu3+ + K+ → EuBa + KBa′. Thus, as demonstrated in Figure 5b, introducing K+ into the lattice
significantly lowers the probability of nonradiative transition and
dramatically boosts radiative transition. However, it must be noted
that even though alkali metal ions provide charge compensation they
cannot completely counter the volume imbalance that arises from the
different ionic radii of Ba2+ and K+ ions. In
the current case, the threshold up to which the volume imbalance problem
can typically be ignored is ∼4% K+ concentration.
Addition of K+ beyond this limitation however leads to
severe deformation of the lattice and reduction of crystallinity,
the net result of which will be manifested as subsequent quenching
of the PL intensity.

Another significant parameter that influences
the PL brightness
of the K+-codoped BaAl2O4:Eu3+ nanophosphors is the generation of oxygen vacancies developed
by the substitution of Ba2+ by K+. Usually,
these types of oxygen vacancies are formed on the nanophosphor surface,
and they behave like sensitizers.55 These
sensitizers assist efficient transfer of energy from the host material
to the Eu3+ ions by creating a strong overlap with the
charge transfer states. As a consequence of this, the oscillator strength
of the radiative transition increases, leading to the subsequent enhancement
in the PL intensity.56,57 However, if the concentration
of K+ goes above a certain limit (4%), an enormous amount
of oxygen vacancy is created in the host lattice. Because of this
problem, the crystal lattice starts to collapse, leading to the subsequent
degradation of PL intensity.

The intensity of the 614 nm emission
depends upon the site of the
Eu3+ ions in Eu3+-doped as well as Eu3+–K+-codoped BaAl2O4 nanophosphors.
If the Eu3+ ion is placed at a low symmetry site, then
the ED transition dominates in the emission spectra, as represented
in Figure 5a. Eventually,
in the current study, it was noted that the emission intensity of
the 614 nm peak was much higher than that of the emission peak at
590 nm of all of the doped and codoped nanophosphors. It is well known
that the ratio of the intensities of the 5D0 → 7F2 and 5D0 → 7F1 transitions, commonly designated
as the asymmetric ratio, essentially depicts the degree of deviation
from the inversion symmetry in the vicinity of Eu3+ in
the host lattice.58 For different concentrations
of K+-codoped samples, the asymmetric ratios were estimated
by respectively calculating the area under the emission peaks of 614
and 590 nm and taking their ratio. The graph depicting the asymmetric
ratio versus the concentration of K+ is shown in Figure S6 of the SI. From the figure, it can
be readily inferred that K+ codoping in the BaAl2O4:Eu3+ nanophosphor substantially increases
the asymmetric ratio.

Signature of this gradual increase in
ED transition is also reflected
from the Commission International del’Eclairage (CIE) chromaticity
coordinates of the BaAl2O4:Eu3+ and
K+-codoped BaAl2O4:Eu3+ nanophosphors shown in the bottom right insets of Figure 5a,b. An increase in the x coordinate along with subsequent decrease in the y coordinate becomes distinctly evident from the chromaticity
diagram of the K+-codoped nanophosphor. This phenomenon
also indicates an improvement of the color purity of the codoped nanophosphor.
The actual estimation of this enhancement of color purity has been
conducted by employing formula59  where (xs,ys) are the coordinates of a sample point, (xi,yi) are the coordinates
of the illuminant point, and (xd,yd) are the coordinates of the dominant wavelength.
In this work, taking (xi,yi) = (0.3101, 0.3162) for the illuminant point and (xd,yd) = (0.67, 0.32)
for the dominant wavelength at 614 nm, the color purities of the 5%
Eu3+ and 5% Eu3+-, 4% K+-codoped
BaAl2O4 nanophosphors were estimated to be 90.4
and 93%, respectively. As a whole, after K+ codoping, the
color coordinate reaches really near the ultimate red chromaticity
for the National Television Standard Committee (NTSC) system and the
characteristic index proves that these codoped phosphors have greater
color saturation.

Cathodoluminescence (CL) characteristics of
the synthesized nanophosphors
have also been examined to justify the suitability of the present
samples for the application in field emission display. The CL spectra
of 5% Eu3+ and 5% Eu3+-, 4% K+-doped
nanophosphors are presented in Figure 6. Under the low-voltage electron beam excitation (5
kV), the CL spectra evidently follow the same spectral properties
that were achieved from the PL measurement. Furthermore, the CL intensity
is also found to be enhanced because of the addition of K+ in the nanocrystal. The obtained strong red emission along with
excellent color purity designates these K+-codoped nanophosphors
to be promising candidates for solid-state lighting and field emission
display applications.

Figure 6 Cathodoluminescence spectra of 5% Eu3+-doped
BaAl2O4 and 5% Eu3+-, 4% K+-codoped
BaAl2O4 nanophosphors.

To confirm the decrease in nonradiative transition with the
incorporation
of a K+ coactivator, the PL decay profiles of 614 nm emission
for both 5% Eu3+- and 5% Eu3+-, 4% K+-codoped BaAl2O4 nanophosphors have been examined
under 394 nm UV excitation, as shown in Figure 7a. The luminescence decay curves of the 5D0 → 7F2 transition
for both the nanophosphors were well fitted by a biexponential function,
which may be represented as follows  where A1 and A2 are the weighting parameters and τ1 and τ2 are the decay components of luminescence
lifetimes. The average lifetime for the biexponential decay can be
expressed as60  The calculated average
lifetimes of 5% Eu3+-doped BaAl2O4 and 4% K+-codoped BaAl2O4:5% Eu3+ nanophosphor
are 0.69 and 0.81 ms, respectively. Generally, at a higher concentration
of the activator ion, energy transfer to the Ba2+ vacancies
together with multipolar interaction among Eu3+ ions turns
out to be a significant cause of nonradiative transitions. The distance
between two Eu3+ ions becomes a crucial parameter in this
case in controlling the energy migration among the same type of activator
ions. This phenomenon is theoretically studied by measuring the Eu–Eu
distances for the Eu-doped and Eu–K-doped systems, using larger,
double-sized supercells of the relaxed configurations described earlier.
For the Eu-doped system, the Eu–Eu distance was observed to
be 10.257 Å, whereas the same increased to 10.311 Å in the
Eu–K-codoped system (shown in Figure 7b,c) as a direct consequence of codoping.
This enhanced distance between Eu atoms is favorable for destroying
the energy transfer among same activators. As a result, with the incorporation
of a K+ coactivator in the BaAl2O4:Eu3+ lattice, the rate of nonradiative transition decreases,
which increases the radiative lifetime consequently.

the 5D0 → 7F2 transition

via 394 nm UV light. (b, c)
Representation of the Eu–Eu distance in a 2 × 2 ×
2 supercell of Eu3+-doped and Eu3+–K+-codoped BaAl2O4 nanophosphors, respectively.

Also, it is well known that the
efficiency of any radiative transition
is always directly proportional to the decay time of that particular
transition; hence, high lifetimes are always recommended for solid-state
lighting applications. The millisecond-order lifetime of the codoped
nanophosphors strongly indicates that the samples carry great promise
for use in the field of display and lighting applications.

3.2.2 Thermal Stability and Electron–Phonon
Coupling
It is often seen that the thermal stability of nanophosphors
plays a vital role in uninterrupted operation of LEDs because the
enhanced temperature at the phosphor–UV LED chip interface
strongly affects the light output and the lifetime of the LED device.61 Accordingly, the high temperature stability
of the doped and codoped phosphors has been investigated for better
exploration of Eu3+ behavior in the corresponding hosts
at high temperature. The temperature-dependent PL spectra of BaAl2O4:5% Eu3+ and BaAl2O4:5% Eu3+, 4% K+ nanophosphors are shown
in Figure 8a. In both
cases, the PL emission intensity decreases as the temperature elevates
to 210 °C from room temperature, demonstrating a temperature
quenching phenomenon.

BaAl2O4:5% Eu3+ nanophosphors. (c)
Configuration
coordinate diagram for the illustration of thermal quenching phenomena
of the nanophosphors.

A careful inspection also clarifies
that the PL emission intensity
decays to 19 and 23% of the initial intensity at 210 °C for Eu3+-doped and Eu3+–K+-codoped nanophosphors,
respectively. Because during operation the temperature at the phosphor–chip
interface increases to ∼150 °C,62 it is very important to investigate the performance of the nanophosphor
at this temperature. At 150 °C, the emission intensity drops
to 17 and 20% of the initial intensity for BaAl2O4:Eu3+ and BaAl2O4:Eu3+, K+ nanophosphors, respectively. The comparison of temperature
quenching behaviors of the phosphors strongly reveals that incorporation
of K+ enhances the thermal stability of the BaAl2O4:Eu3+ nanophosphor.

The observed thermal
quenching behavior of the nanophosphors can
be explained with the help of a typical configuration coordinate model,
which is represented in Figure 8b. At lower temperatures, the transition from the bottom of
the 5D excited state toward the 7F ground state
is not dependent on temperature and gives radiative emission. However,
at higher temperatures, the excited electrons at the 5D
level become thermally promoted to the CTB via the 5D0-CTB crossover point and then relax nonradiatively to the 7F0 ground state of Eu3+ through the 7F0-CTB crossover point. The nonradiative transition
becomes more prevalent with the increasing temperature and therefore
diminishes the luminescence intensity. In this thermal quenching process,
the excited electrons need to be activated by overcoming the energy
barrier between the 5D ground state and 5D-CTB
crossover point. Hence, this energy barrier is called activation energy,
which can be directly estimated from the modified Arrhenius equation63  where I0denotes the initial
PL emission intensity, T is the temperature in kelvin, IT represents the PL intensity
at temperature T, C is a constant
parameter, and k is the Boltzmann constant (8.629
× 10–5 eV
K–1). The activation energy, Ea, can be obtained from the slope of the straight line generated
by plotting the graph ln[(I0/IT) – 1] versus 1/kT (shown in S7 of SI). The activation energies
were found to be 0.034 and 0.038 eV for the Eu3+-doped
and Eu3+–K+-codoped BaAl2O4 nanophosphors.

It is well known that the nonradiative
decay and multiphonon relaxations
of Eu3+ in the host matrix are highly dependent on the
electron–phonon coupling strength. Phonon sideband (PSB) spectroscopy
is a popular technique to determine the electron–phonon coupling
strength of rare-earth ions in the host matrix.64 PSB spectra can be obtained by taking the barycenter wavenumber
of the 7F0 → 5D2 ED transition of Eu3+ as a reference for the zero-phonon
line. Figure 9 presents
the PSB spectra of Eu3+-doped BaAl2O4 and K+-codoped BaAl2O4:Eu3+ nanophosphors under an emission wavelength of 614 nm. Because the
energy gap between the 5D2 and 5D3 transitions is larger than vibrational energies of most of
the chemical bonds in inorganic compounds, any weak band situated
between two consecutive transitions (7F0 → 5D2 and 7F0 → 5D3 in case of Eu3+) denotes phonon-assisted
transition. The phonon-assisted transition was found to be situated
at 1920 cm–1 for both the doped and codoped nanophosphors.

Figure 9 Phonon
sideband spectra of BaAl2O4:5% Eu3+ (green line) and BaAl2O4:5% Eu3+, 4% K+ (red line) nanophosphors. The magnified
view of the phonon-assisted transition is shown in the inset.

The level up to which any electronic
transition is coupled with
such a phonon mode can be calculated from the electron–phonon
coupling strength, which is expressed by the Huang–Rhys factor
(S) as65  where IPSB and IZP are the integral
intensity of the PSB and
the zero-phonon line, respectively. The Huang–Rhys factors
for the 5% Eu3+-doped and 5% Eu3+-, 4% K+-codoped BaAl2O4 nanophosphors were
estimated to be 0.106 and 0.082, respectively. This parameter further
ascertains that addition of K+ leads to lower electron–phonon
coupling and subsequent reduction in nonradiative transition, giving
rise to the enhancement of PL intensity.

3.3 Comparison
with the Commercial Phosphor
Furthermore, to check the performance
of the nanophosphors with
respect to commercial phosphors, PL characteristics of the synthesized
nanophosphors are compared with those of commercial red-emitting Y2O3:0.08Eu3+ phosphors under 394 nm excitation
(shown in Figure 10a). Steady-state PL spectra reveal that PL intensity of 5% Eu3+, 4% K+:BaAl2O4 nanophosphors
is slightly less than that of the commercial phosphor. However, the
color coordinate of the commercial phosphor is found to be (0.641,
0.358), which is even worse than that of the synthesized 5% Eu3+, 4% K+:BaAl2O4 nanophosphors.
The calculated color purity of the commercial phosphor is 91.4%, which
is less than that of the phosphors synthesized in the current work
(93%). Moreover, the thermal stability of the commercial phosphor
is depicted in Figure 10d, which shows that at 210 °C the phosphor undergoes significant
quenching of PL (35% of initial PL intensity), whereas 5% Eu3+, 4% K+:BaAl2O4 nanophosphors exhibit
only 19% decay of the initial PL intensity.

Figure 10 Comparison of (a) PL
emission spectra, (b) CIE chromaticity diagrams,
and (c) quantum yields of the synthesized BaAl2O4:5% Eu3+, 4% K+ nanophosphor with the commercial
phosphor Y2O3:8% Eu3+. (d) Temperature-dependent
PL spectra of the commercial phosphor Y2O3:8%
Eu3+.

Absolute quantum yield
(QY) of the phosphors is also calculated
using an integrating sphere, and the corresponding PL spectra of the
commercial phosphor and 5% Eu3+, 4% K+:BaAl2O4 nanophosphors in the integrating sphere are
depicted in Figure 10c. The QY value of the 5% Eu3+, 4% K+:BaAl2O4 nanophosphor is calculated to be 77.4%, which
is closely comparable to that of the QY of commercial phosphor (84.2%).
The obtained results strongly suggest that Eu3+–K+-codoped BaAl2O4 nanophosphors hold
great promise for competing commercial phosphors in lighting and display
applications.

4 Conclusions
In summary,
we have successfully presented a cost-effective citrate
nitrate technique to synthesize Eu3+-doped and Eu3+–K+-codoped BaAl2O4 nanophosphors
for a wide range of Eu3+ and K+ concentrations.
The derived nanophosphors entail bright red emission because of the 5D0 → 7FJ (J = 0–4) transitions of Eu3+ when excited under UV and low-voltage electron beam (5 kV) irradiation.
PL and CL investigations of the nanophosphors reveal that the incorporation
of a K+ coactivator remarkably enhances the luminescence
intensity and subsequent color purity. The charge compensation phenomenon,
which is observed with the addition of the K+ coactivator
is responsible for the enhancement of crystallinity and the consequent
increase in luminescence intensity. Incorporation of the K+ coactivator also results in a stronger charge sharing between Eu
and O, which further intensifies the CTB in codoped nanophosphors.
It is also established that K+ codoping increases the inter-Eu
distance, which in turn increases the radiative lifetime of Eu3+ ions by reducing various nonradiative transitions and electron–phonon
coupling strength. Enhancement of thermal stability is also achieved
via K+ codoping. The strategy of K+ codoping
successfully stands out as an effective route to enhancing the efficiency
of BaAl2O4:Eu3+ nanophosphor by reducing
the nonradiative transition centers in it. Finally, the obtained results
strongly demonstrate that K+-codoped BaAl2O4:Eu3+ nanophosphors could be promising candidates
for use in solid-state lighting as well as field emission display
devices.
