The antiscaling properties of multiwalled
carbon nanotube (MWCNT)–polyamide
(PA) nanocomposite reverse-osmosis (RO) desalination membranes (MWCNT–PA
membranes) were studied. An aqueous solution of calcium chloride (CaCl2) and sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) was used to precipitate
in situ calcium carbonate (CaCO3) to emulate scaling. The
MWCNT contents of the studied nanocomposite membranes prepared by
interfacial polymerization ranged from 0 wt % (plain PA) to 25 wt
%. The inorganic antiscaling performances were compared for the MWCNT–PA
membranes to laboratory-made plain and commercial PA-based RO membranes.
The scaling process on the membrane surface was monitored by fluorescence
microscopy after labeling the scale with a fluorescent dye. The deposited
scale on the MWCNT–PA membrane was less abundant and more easily
detached by the shear stress under cross-flow compared to other membranes.
Molecular dynamics simulations revealed that the attraction of Ca2+ ions was hindered by the interfacial water layer formed
on the surface of the MWCNT–PA membrane. Together, our findings
revealed that the observed outstanding antiscaling performance of
MWCNT–PA membranes results from (i) a smooth surface morphology,
(ii) a low surface charge, and (iii) the formation of an interfacial
water layer. The MWCNT–PA membranes described herein are advantageous
for water treatment.

Introduction
Reverse-osmosis (RO)
membranes based on aromatic polyamide (PA)
have been extensively used to provide clean water by purification
and desalination because of their high-cost efficiency, high-volume
water production, and reasonably simple operation.1,2 However,
fouling is still the main cause of the undesirable decrease in permeate
flux, which results in an increased energy consumption during RO membrane’s
operation. In addition, the necessary periodic membrane cleaning process
interrupts the continuous operation of the purification or desalination.
Although organic fouling can be largely reduced by using a nanofiltration
pretreatment process, it is difficult to prevent the deposition of
inorganic foulant, also known as “scale”. Scale is precipitated
from the ions such as Ca2+ and CO32– in the feed water that, unlike organic foulants such as carbohydrate
polymers or proteins, are not completely removed by nanofiltration
because of their small size (Figure S1).
To maintain the membrane performance against inorganic scaling, membrane
cleaning and pretreatments involving the use of antiscalants are periodically
carried out3−8 to prolong the membrane lifetime.9 Therefore,
water treatment technology requires robust RO membranes with improved
antifouling/antiscaling properties to lower the maintenance costs
and save energy in large-scale water desalination processes. In addition,
reducing the use of antiscaling additives during membrane pretreatments
has been encouraged recently to decrease the impact of desalination
plants on the environment.10 For these
reasons, RO membranes with antiscaling properties are becoming more
and more important in efforts to prevent serious fouling and to improve
environmentally friendly water desalination processes.

In general,
organic foulants can cause serious problems because
of their strong adhesion.11,12 On the contrary, inorganic
scaling by itself is not considered as a serious issue because it
is washable by using diluted acid solutions.9,13−15 Although scaling generally does not damage the membrane,16 the scale accumulation decreases the membrane
performance and promotes organic fouling. Indeed, in the presence
of calcium the hydrophobicity of the membranes increases17 and results in the formation of denser and thicker
complex fouling layers in combination with organic foulants,18,19 which are difficult to remove even with acidic solutions.17 A promising approach to improve the antifouling
properties of PA is to incorporate multiwalled carbon nanotube (MWCNT)
to the membranes. It has been found that additions as low as 0.001%
and as high as 15.5 wt % of MWCNT to PA membrane improved not only
the permeate flux but also the antifouling properties against BSA,
reduced the scaling by sea salt, mainly by reducing the surface roughness
and increasing the membrane hydrophilicity.1,20,21

In recent years, computational studies
of membranes have improved
considerably in part because of the increased availability of computer
resources. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have been mainly used
to calculate water diffusion and salt rejection22 and lately to study protein fouling.20 Organic fouling is a polymer–polymer simulation
and thus is relatively easy to simulate. However, inorganic scaling
is a complex problem because it involves the simulation between solvated
ions, a phase change, the PA structure, and water. The homogeneous
nucleation of CaCO3 in solution by itself is already a
complex problem that has been approached using both ab initio23,24 and classical MD methods.25,26 Although ab initio
techniques can be more accurate to compute the energy and stability
of the prenucleation CaCO3 clusters, it is limited to a
few tens of atoms and thus cannot be used to simulate the interaction
with the membrane structure. In the last years, new force fields with
increased precision have allowed to simulate the homogeneous nucleation
of CaCO3 by using MD with very good results. In the present
work, we have used the theoretic framework developed by Raiteri and
Gale25,26 to simulate the homogenous nucleation of
CaCO3 and applied it to simulate the effect of the PA structure
on the stability of amorphous CaCO3 (ACC) clusters. In
this work, we used the theoretic framework developed by Raiteri and
Gale to develop a novel approach to simulate the scaling on PA and
MWCNT–PA membranes. We also evaluated the antiscaling performance
of MWCNT–PA membranes against CaCO3 by in situ fluorescence
microscopy (FM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and permeation
measurements. In addition, we performed MD simulations to gain insights
into the mechanism of scale nucleation. Finally, we propose a possible
mechanism for antiscaling nanocomposite membranes. The combined experiment
and simulation results enabled a better understanding of the antiscaling
mechanism in MWCNT–PA membrane.

Results and Discussion
Antiscaling
Performance of the MWCNT–PA Nanocomposite
Membrane Studied by Water Permeation
The permeate flux J and salt rejection values R of each membrane
including the MWCNT–PA membrane with 15.5 wt % MWCNT under
typical desalination conditions are summarized in Table 1. On the basis of those performances,
we chose three types of membranes having comparable properties for
the present antiscaling study. The trade-off between salt rejection
and permeation in desalination membranes is well-known, and there
are reports27 of MWCNT–PA membranes
with higher permeate flux but lower salt rejection, that is, 19.2
L m–2 h–1 and 98.2% salt rejection
compared to the 8.7 L m–2 h–1 and
99.8% salt rejection by our MWCNT–PA. In this study, the MWCNT–PA
membrane with 15.5 wt % MWCNT was studied because of the rejection
and permeation similar to that of the CM-PA membranes.

Each RO Membrane Used for the Scaling Study at 0.7 MPa and 500 mL/min
Cross-flow Experiments Using 0.06 wt % NaCl Aqueous Solution
RO membrane	permeate flux, J/L m–2 h–1	salt rejection, R/%	
MWCNT–PA membrane (15.5 wt % MWCNT)	8.7	99.8	
Lab-PA membrane	7.9	99.7

membrane (CM-PA)	9.2	99.8	
Figure 1 shows the
changes in the value of Jr(t) of each membrane during cross-flow filtration, evaluated as a function
of time after the addition of the scaling precursors. The periodical
fluctuations seen every 24 h are caused by the adjustment of salinity,
but these perturbations are small compared with the long-term trends.
All of the membranes studied showed a drastic decrease to approx.
60–75% of the starting permeation quickly after the scaling
process started. Subsequently, the flux remained at the same level
in cases of the lab-PA membrane (0 wt % MWCNT), CM-PA, and MWCNT–PA
membranes with a MWCNT content of 13 wt % or lower.

Figure 1 Normalized permeate flux, Jr(t), as a function of time
after the addition of scale-forming
solutions at t = 0 on (a) lab-PA membrane and CM-PA
and (b,c) MWCNT–PA membrane containing 5–25 wt % of
MWCNT. The membranes containing MWCNT at over 15.5 wt % recovered
the permeate flux with time. (d) Direct comparison of lab-PA, CM-PA,
and MWCNT–PA membrane (15.5 wt %).

Permeate fluxes gradually recover up to 95 ± 2% of the
starting
values on the nanocomposite membranes containing more than 15.5 wt
% of MWCNTs. The recovered fluxes Jr(t) were 97% for 15.5 and 20 wt % MWCNTs and 94% for 25 wt
% MWCNTs. The reason of the different scaling properties of the membranes
containing above 13 wt % might be in part because of a volumetric
percolation effect of the MWCNTs. The addition of MWCNT slightly decreased
the salt rejection, whereas the permeate flux increased. We therefore
selected the membranes containing 15.5 wt % of MWCNTs as the representative
with the highest salt rejection among the studied MWCNT–PA
membranes.

In Situ Scale Formation Monitored by FM
Figure 2a–c
is a series of FM
images of each membrane every 12 h during a 48 h period during the
scaling study. Fluorescence quenching caused by the MWCNT embedded
in the membranes was negligible (Figure S2). The initial control image shows that the fluorescence from the
membrane itself, the additives, the acrylic cell, and the spacer is
low enough to avoid interference with the fluorescence of the dyed
scale. Thus, the green fluorescence in the following frames is originated
from the CaCO3 scale deposited on the membrane surfaces.

at 0–48 h. (a) MWCNT–PA, (b) lab-PA, and (c) CM-PA membrane.
The arrows indicate representative figures of scale deposition. (d)
Averaged normalized fluorescence intensity from the RO membrane images
shown in (a–d) (the spacer was not included for the intensity
counting) as a function of scaling time.

After 12 h of scaling, the CaCO3 deposited preferentially
at the gap between the membrane and the spacer, where the water flow
stagnated. The scale was visible through the transparent polypropylene
spacer (Figure S3). The onset of the fluorescence
signal from the CaCO3 was as short as 12 h on the lab-PA
and CM-PA. Particularly, fluorescence from the CM-PA was intense,
and a deposition pattern that was identified (see arrows at the upper
and lower part in the area enclosed by the spacer in Figure 2c) remained after 48 h, and
the fluorescence signal intensity increased with time because of the
gradual growth of scale deposition. The lab-PA and CM-PA exhibited
homogeneous scaling, as indicated by the overall fluorescent green
signal from the entire membrane, even though the scaling patterns
of the lab-PA (Figure 2a) were not so clear as that of CM-PA (Figure 2b) at 48 h. These scaling patterns were probably
originated from the turbulent flow pattern caused by the spacer.28

On the other hand, the amount of scale
deposited on the MWCNT–PA
membranes was much lower than that on CM-PA, revealing an intrinsic
antiscaling property. Figure 2d shows the quantified fluorescence signal from the membrane
surfaces by scale deposition. There were slight differences on fluorescence
of each samples which were not yet exposed to scale-forming solution
(t = 0 h). Therefore, the fluorescence intensity
was normalized relative to that of the pristine membrane (t = 0 h) to eliminate the influence of the background. No
increase in the fluorescence intensity was observed on the MWCNT–PA
membranes. The microscopic examination of the membrane surfaces shows
the absence of large-scale particles after 12 h; thus, the drastic Jr(t) decrease, as shown in Figure 1, suggests the clogging
of the water channel on the membrane with small particles (a few nanometers
in diameter, that is, too small for the optical microscope resolution)
by instantaneous scale formation.

Figure 3a,c,e is
the FM snapshots of the membranes after 48 h of scaling. The CaCO3 deposited on the membrane surface was confirmed on all membranes.
The fluorescence signal from the MWCNT–PA membranes was considerably
lower compared to the signal from the other membranes. The sudden
disappearance of the green spots of fluorescence (circles in Figure 3a,b) after exposure
to a water flow of 500 mL/min during additional 4 h indicates scale
detachment in the MWCNT–PA membrane. This is an important and
advantageous characteristic of the MWCNT–PA membranes. Interestingly,
no scale detachment was observed on the lab-PA and CM-PA (Figure 3d,f).

Figure 3 FM snapshots of the MWCNT–PA
(a,b), lab-PA (c,d), and CM-PA
(e,f) after additional 4 h of cross-flow operation under scaling conditions.
Scale formation (a) and spontaneous detachment (b) were observed at
the marked regions by circles with numbers on the MWCNT–PA
membrane.

Our FM observations revealed that
the scale deposited on the membranes
and around the spacer could be removed by acid washing using a 5.0
vol % of acetic acid (Figure S4). The acid
washing did not modify the scaling behavior of each membrane, and
the second and third scaling cycles resulted in patterns and fluorescence
intensity similar to those in the first cycle.

Relationship between Membrane
Surface Morphology and Scaling
Figure 4a–c
includes SEM images of the surface of each pristine membrane. MWCNT–PA
membrane shows a relatively smooth surface, whereas the lab-PA and
CM-PA membranes have a typical ridge-and-valley morphology.29,30 Atomic force microscopy (AFM) observations confirmed that the roughness
of the MWCNT–PA membrane was smaller.20 The membrane with higher surface area provided by such ridge-and-valley
structures2,30,31 has a higher
permeate flux and salt rejection, although it is likely that surface
roughness could trigger scale deposition.32 By increasing the MWCNT content up to 15.5 wt % (Figure 4a), the surface became much
smoother than that of the plain PA membranes.33

and (c) CM-PA membrane. After the scaling experiment (52 h), the surfaces

magnification (g–i). ACC scale is indicated with yellow arrows.

SEM images of the membrane surface
at low (Figure 4d–f)
and high (Figure 4g–i)
magnifications are shown for
the samples after 52 h of scaling deposition. As shown in the figures,
the surface of the MWCNT–PA is cleaner than the surfaces of
the lab-PA and CM-PA with a scale, as indicated by arrows in the figures.
All samples show a small quantity of well-defined cubic crystals of
CaCO3, as confirmed by energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis
(Figure S5).

Our SEM observations
revealed agglomerates consisting of minute
spherical particles (10–50 nm; Figure S6), which appear as typical ACC.34 Those
ACC particulates tended to grow by clinging within the ridge-and-valley
structures in the lab-PA and CM-PA (Figure 4h,i). This is consistent with the observation
that ACC tends to be more stable in confined niches.34 On the contrary, ACC was less abundant on the MWCNT–PA
membrane (Figure 4g)
most likely because of its smooth surface. ACC scaling also grew around
the crystalline CaCO3 on CM-PA. Strong fluorescence intensity
from the CM-PA, as shown above (Figure 2), is presumably because of the formation of both crystalline
CaCO3 and ACC. Indeed, the formation of both phases is
common as ACC spontaneously transforms to a stable crystalline form
at ambient temperatures.35

The smoother
surface of the MWCNT–PA membranes promoted
the growth of crystalline CaCO3 rather than ACC; when compared
with the fluorescence observations, a preferential dying of ACC was
found. The deposited crystalline CaCO3 was easily detached
by the water flow when the size of the crystals became large, as shown
in Figure 3. Our observations
correlating roughness and scale deposition confirm the previous report
that the membranes with higher roughness are prone to scale formation.32

Static heterogeneous nucleation study
(Supporting Information section S1.1) showed that the amount of formed
CaCO3 was greater, and particle sizes are larger on the
lab-PA membrane (Figure S7a) compared to
the MWCNT–PA membranes (Figure S7b). These results confirm an intrinsic antiscaling behavior of the
MWCNT–PA membranes, in agreement with the cross-flow experiments.

Effect of Membrane Surface Charge on Scaling
Anionic
membranes with a negatively charged surface promote more inorganic
scaling by the ionic attraction than cationic membranes.36−38 Surface charge analysis by zeta potential measurements can thus
provide a more precise understanding of the scaling mechanism. Figure 5 shows the zeta potential
of the membranes plotted as a function of pH. The MWCNT–PA
was approx. 20–30 mV less negatively charged compared to the
lab-PA and CM-PA in the pH range from 4.5 to 9.0. The negative surface
charge in PA membranes is originated from the hydrolysis of unreacted
acyl chloride that convert to carboxyl groups.39,40 The effect of MWCNT to the formation of carboxyl groups is unclear;
however, we propose that it might be related to the stiffening of
the PA structure41 that might avoid the
migration of these hydrophilic and negatively charged groups to the
membrane surface. This might be an advantageous feature of the MWCNT–PA
membranes because less negatively charged surfaces have weaker electrostatic
attraction toward Ca2+ ions near the membrane surface,
thereby reducing nucleation rate of CaCO3.

Figure 5 Zeta potentials of the
MWCNT–PA, lab-PA, and CM-PA membranes.
The charge of the MWCNT–PA membrane is closer to neutral potential
compared to those of the lab-PA and CM-PA.

MD Simulation
The MWCNTs used here (with approx. 10
nm diam) in PA are much larger compared to CaCO3 clusters
(approx. 0.4–1.0 nm in size). Therefore, a flat graphitic sheet,
or single-layer graphene, can be used to simulate the MWCNT surface,
as reported in the literature.41 After
running a charge-transfer calculation in the graphene-PA (G-PA), the
total charge of the PA became positive +4.65e, and
the graphene total charge is negative, −4.65e. These results are shown in Figure S8, in which (a) an MD snapshot and (b) a charge-density map of the
G-PA model with graphene (positioned at Z = 0.0 nm)
are shown. The magnitude of the charge transfer from PA to graphene
is particularly strong above the surface of graphene (approx. Z = 0.5–1.0 nm), and it gradually decreases at distances
>1.0 nm from the graphene.

The main contribution of charge
transfer
is because of the electron transfer from the PA-aromatic rings to
the graphene sheet. Similar charge transfer behavior was observed
for the MWCNT–PA model as well (Figure S8c,d). The electron transfer from PA to the MWCNT results
in a total negative charge of −3.21e, and
the total PA charge increases to a positive charge of +3.21e. Therefore, the use of the G-PA model is adequate when
simulating the antiscaling behavior of MWCNT–PA.

The
water molecules are bound to the G-PA and PA surface by hydrogen
bonds. Figure 6 shows
water molecules on (a) G-PA and (b) PA. The average number of water
molecules per unit area was 19.2 nm–2 for G-PA and
11.7 nm–2 for PA. This well-packed and homogeneous
water layer on G-PA is known as the interfacial water layer.42 As supported by the zeta potential measurement,
G-PA surface has a weaker negative charge that tends to interfere
with oxygen lone pairs of water molecules, resulting in the attraction
of more water molecules and the shielding of amide bonds within the
membrane surface (blue spheres). Therefore, facing-up hydrogen atoms
of the interfacial water layer are abundant on the G-PA, where the
white areas correspond to hydrogen atoms, as shown in Figure 6a,b. The higher affinity of
the membrane surface for water molecules can be partially responsible
for the higher wettability shown by contact angle measurements of
the MWCNT–PA membrane (40.1 ± 3.8°) compared to the
lab-PA membrane (47.7 ± 3.6°).

(f) 20 ns. Water molecules were considered for the simulations but
not present in the figure. (g) CaCO3 potential energy above
G-PA or plain PA with simulation time.

During the scale formation, the nucleation of CaCO3 is
driven by strong Coulomb interactions between Ca2+ and
CO32– in aqueous solutions on the membranes.43 At an initial state, CaCO3 is nucleated
as an amorphous solid, followed by the adsorption of CaCO3 molecules on the membranes. We performed the MD calculations with
the NPT ensemble by applying 1 atm. Figure 6c–f includes MD snapshots after 3
and 20 ns for CaCO3 formation above G-PA or plain PA. The
nuclei of ACC (yellow dashed circles in Figure 6c) were approached and drifted near the G-PA
surface after 3 ns. After 20 ns, CaCO3 crystals were located
away from the G-PA surface (Figure 6d). This result indicates weak interaction between
the CaCO3 and the G-PA surface. On the other hand, in terms
of CaCO3 above plain PA, CaCO3 approached (i)
and then combined with a second CaCO3 molecule (ii) after
3 ns (Figure 6e). A
protonucleus of CaCO3 was still stable on the surface of
PA after 20 ns (Figure 6f). These MD simulations showed that CaCO3 interacts stronger
with the plain PA surface compared to G-PA.

Strong Coulomb interactions
occurring between the CaCO3 nucleus and water molecules
result in rigid water shells.44Figure 6g shows the CaCO3 potential energy involving Coulomb
and van der Waals energies with simulation time. For the initial simulation
time, less than 2 ns, the potential energy decreases quickly. This
large potential decrease corresponds to the formation of CaCO3 nuclei, and the energy gradually decreases after 2 ns. The
average potential energy of CaCO3 on plain PA at 20 ns
was −47.91 (kcal/mol), whereas that of G-PA was 104.68 (kcal/mol).
These results suggest a highly stable adsorption of CaCO3 on plain PA membranes, which would result in scale formation and
accumulation. Furthermore, these results are also consistent with
the fact that CaCO3 structures are more stable in confinement.34 CaCO3 clusters are stacked on the
surface of plain PA and grow by aggregating with other CaCO3 clusters (Figure 6e,f). From the multiscale viewpoint, our results are consistent with
the observation that ACC preferentially forms in confined niches even
at the microscopic level.34

Radial
distribution functions are shown in Figure 7. For the CaCO3 formation, Ca2+ interacts strongly with water than CO32– at the hydration state.44,45 Therefore, the simulation
was focused on the interaction between Ca2+ and water. Figure 7a illustrates the
radial distribution function between Ca2+ and the oxygen
of water molecules. A sharp peak at 0.23 nm indicates the presence
of a strong first hydration shell. The distribution peak of the first
hydration shell is larger in the G-PA model compared to the plain
PA. It is interesting to note that the Ca2+ located adjacent
to the membrane was influenced by the membrane, and the first hydration
shell was formed around Ca2+. For G-PA, Ca2+ had a more rigid water shell according to MD simulations. The rigid
hydration shell (interfacial water) is formed by a water-shielding
effect from the PA amide bonds.

Figure 7 Radial distribution of (a) oxygen of water
and Ca2+;
(b) hydrogen of PA amide bond and water, and (c) oxygen of PA amide
bond and Ca2+.

Figure 7b
shows
the radial distribution function between oxygen of PA amide bonds
and hydrogen of water molecules. The amide bonds of PA in G-PA were
surrounded by several water molecules (interfacial water layer composed
of first and second hydration layers), resulting in the shield of
PA amide bonds from the interaction with Ca2+. The first
and second hydration layers formed were 0.35 nm thick (Figure 7b). The shielding effect of
the interfacial water layer on G-PA was larger than that on the plain
PA membrane. In fact, a radial distribution peak between Ca2+ and the oxygen of PA amide bond existed in the plain PA membranes
but was absent in G-PA (Figure 7c). This means that Ca2+ is strongly attracted
to a plain PA surface compared to the G-PA model. The water-shielding
effect, which is associated with the formation of interfacial water
on G-PA, effectively provides antiscaling behavior to the membrane
surface by weakening the interaction between PA amide bonds and CaCO3 individual molecules and clusters.

The inorganic scale
surrounded by the interfacial water layer,
formed by the stronger hydration interaction, weakens the adsorption
potential of CaCO3 to the membrane surface. We performed
MD step trajectory mapping with one CaCO3 molecule and
an ACC form constructed by 50 CaCO3 molecules for 5 ns.

Figure 8 shows the
center of mass trajectory of CaCO3 and the atomic density
of PA (in gray). Figure 8a,b shows one CaCO3 trajectory of the G-PA model and one
of the plain PA, respectively. In both cases, CaCO3 drifts
near the membrane surfaces. However, it is important to note that
CaCO3 had a higher mobility above the surface of G-PA with
time (Figure 8a) when
compared to plain PA. The diffusion coefficient of one CaCO3 was 2.55 × 10–6 cm2 s–1 on G-PA and 0.42 × 10–6 cm2 s–1 on plain PA.46 The MD
trajectory for ACC (n = 50) of G-PA and plain PA
are shown in Figure 8c,d. The diffusion coefficient of ACC was 0.69 × 10–6 cm2 s–1 on G-PA and 0.11 × 10–6 cm2 s–1 on plain PA.
ACC above the surface of G-PA model also widely drifts compared to
plain PA and stays away from the G-PA surface after 4 ns because of
the weak interactions occurring between ACC and PA.

Conclusions
MWCNT–PA membranes synthesized with
MWCNT content up to
25 wt % were studied for inorganic antiscaling performance, and the
CaCO3 deposition was monitored in situ by FM. The MWCNT–PA
membrane containing 15.5 wt % of MWCNT showed antiscaling properties
in addition to a lower decrease in water permeability during the scale
tests compared to other PA-based membranes and interestingly showed
a gradual recovery of the water flow because of scale detachment.
This outstanding antiscaling performance of the MWCNT–PA membrane
was caused by smoother surface, less negatively charged surface than
other PA-based membranes, and the induction of an interfacial water
layer on the MWCNT–PA membrane surface. Small loadings of MWCNT
did not affect the surface morphology of the membrane nor did they
restrict the mobility of the PA network. Also, the results show that
approximately 15 wt % of MWCNT is necessary to substantially modify
the PA properties. Our MWCNT–PA membrane with superior antiscaling
properties may be highly advantageous when operating in harsh conditions
such as water containing large amounts of inorganic moieties. These
membranes can be applicable not only for desalination but also for
groundwater, industrial water, and sewage treatment.

Reverse Osmosis Membranes Preparation
MWCNT–PA
membranes containing variable amounts of MWCNT (ranging from 5 to
25 wt %), laboratory-made plain PA (lab-PA) membranes (0 wt % of MWCNT),
and one of the typical commercial RO PA (CM-PA) membranes were studied.
The lab-PA membranes and the MWCNT–PA membranes were prepared
by interfacial polymerization processes as previously described.45 Typically, porous polysulfone substrates were
soaked in a dispersion of MWCNT in an MPD aqueous solution, and the
excess liquid was drained. The support membranes were then immersed
in TMC solution in hexane, and the interfacial polymerization took
place. The different MWCNT contents in the PA were controlled by changing
the MWCNT concentration in the MPD aqueous solution. The presence
of MWCNT within the membrane was confirmed by SEM observation in peeled-off
RO active layer (Figure S9a) and through
an induced crack in the RO active layer (Figure S9b). Addition of nanotubes during the PA synthesis usually
decreases the roughness of the resulting PA membranes, as it can be
seen by comparing the AFM images provided in Figure S9c,d. The plain PA membrane shows a roughness (Ra) of 37.2 nm compared to the 28.2 nm of the MWCNT–PA
membrane. We studied in detail the MWCNT content in the nanocomposite
membranes and its effect on the morphology and chlorine resistance
in a recent publication.47

Cross-flow
Filtration Experiments
The schematic illustration
of the experimental system is shown in Figure S10a. A cross-flow filtration system (FTU-1, Membrane Solutions
Technology, Tokyo) was operated at 0.7 MPa with a flow rate of 500
mL/min through the cross-flow cell. The membrane used for the study
was diam 25.0 mm (MWCNT–PA and lab-PA membranes were shown
as examples in Figure S10b,c). A custom-made
transparent acrylic crossflow cell (diam 25.0 mm, height 0.356 mm
in the cell chamber; Figure S10d) with
an effective membrane surface area of 3.46 cm2 was used
to monitor the membrane surface by FM. A spacer (1.2 mm thick, GE
Water & Process Technologies, Trevose, PA, USA) was placed on
the membrane surface (Figure S10e) to replicate
the typical flow patterns in the large-scale RO modules, and the water
source was kept at 21 ± 1 °C and pH8 during all experiments.
Aqueous solutions of NaCl (0.06 wt %) were used for the initial compaction
process. Salinity and pH were adjusted every 24 h to keep constant
during the long-term test. Relatively low NaCl concentration and pressure
were chosen for the scaling study because the acrylic cross-flow cell
has an upper pressure operation limit of 1 MPa. Dark spots observed
in Figure S10e are associated with high
local concentration of MWCNT in the PA membrane. The NaCl rejection, R (%), and permeate flux, J (L m–2 h–1) were derived using an electrical conductivity
meter and a balance, respectively. The normalized flux Jr(t) was defined to evaluate the permeate
flux change. Details are available in Supporting Information section S1.2. The SEM images (top and side views, Figure S10f,g) of the spacers showed that threads
in one direction (labeled i) supported on the RO membrane surface,
whereas the threads in the other direction (ii) lie on top of the
other threads without contacting the membrane. The concentration of
the aqueous mixture was determined as described in the literature.36 After compaction of the membrane in the cross-flow,
CaCl2 (1000 ppm) and NaHCO3 (100 ppm) were dissolved
in NaCl aqueous solution (0.06 wt %). The basic chemical reaction
of CaCl2 and NaHCO3 can be written as follows: 1  

CaCO3 is insoluble in water,
and it consequently precipitates both in solution and on the surface
of the membrane, thus resulting in scale formation.

Membrane Characterization
Each pristine membrane and
scale-deposited membrane were observed by SEM using an SU8000 (Hitachi,
Tokyo) operated at 1.0 kV of the acceleration voltage. The samples
were coated with platinum (approx. 1.0 nm thickness) to avoid surface
charging during the observation. An EDX analysis using the same instrument
was conducted. For FM, calcein solutions were prepared by adding calcein
(100 mg) into buffer solution (500 mL, pH 9.18). Selective dying of
the CaCO3 with a fluorescent dye was performed by adding
the calcein solution (20 mL), followed by flushing the cross-flow
cell chamber with scale-forming solution (2.0 L). FM images were recorded
every 12 h during 48 h. After 48 h of the scaling test, the membrane
surface was further studied for 4 h using a 500 mL/min flow to monitor
the possible scaling detachment. In all of the FM images of the membranes,
the solution was fed from left to right. CaCO3 on the membranes
was imaged using blue light (λ = 490 nm). The camera used was
a CMOS microscope digital eyepiece camera (MC500, Ostec, Guanzhou,
China), acquiring images with an exposure time of 196 ms and equipped
with an epifluorescence mode (SMZ18 stereomicroscope; Nikon, Tokyo)
by a P2-EFLC green filter. The membrane was regenerated by acid wash
using acetic acid (5.0 vol %) for 30 min at 21 ± 1 °C under
0.7 MPa and a flow rate of 500 mL/min. After the cleaning process,
the scaling experiments were repeated for each membrane. Zeta potentials
were measured using an electrokinetic analyzer (SurPASS3, Anton Paar,
Graz, Austria) by the streaming potential technique. Two pieces of
each membrane (1.0 × 2.0 cm) were fixed to the holders with waterproof
double-sided tape and then set facing each other with a 110 μm
space. KOH (0.05 mol/L) and HCl (0.05 mol/L) were used for the titration,
and KCl (1.0 mmol/L) was used as an electrolyte solution.

MD Simulation
Classical MD simulations were performed
using the LAMMPS code.48 Our target was
to simulate the interaction of Ca2+ and CO32– ions with the plain PA and G-PA composite hydrated
models. The G-PA model represents the PA deposited on the outer surface
of a large diameter-MWCNT. This model takes into account the influence
of the MWCNT on the topology of the PA similar to our previous work41 and the charge transfer of the PA to the outer
walls of the MWCNT.49 The simulation on
the diffusion of Ca2+ and CO32– ions, as well as ACC, was performed using the flexible force-field
parameters reported by Raiteri and Gale,25,26 considering the theoretical basis described in other studies.44,45 Additional details of the simulation are available in Supporting Information section S1.3.
