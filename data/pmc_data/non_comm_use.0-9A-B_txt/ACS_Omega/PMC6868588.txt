Direct electricity
production from waste biomass in a microbial
fuel cell (MFC) offers the advantage of producing renewable electricity
at a high Coulombic efficiency. However, low MFC voltage (below 0.5
V) necessitates the simultaneous operation of multiple MFCs controlled
by a power management system (PMS) adapted for operating bioelectrochemical
systems with complex nonlinear dynamics. This work describes a novel
PMS designed for efficient energy harvesting from multiple MFCs. The
PMS includes a switched-capacitor-based converter, which ensures operation
of each MFC at its maximum power point (MPP) by regulating the output
voltage around half of its open-circuit voltage. The open-circuit
voltage of each MFC is estimated online regardless of MFC internal
parameter knowledge. The switched-capacitor-based converter is followed
by an upconverter, which increases the output voltage to a required
level. Advantages of the proposed PMS include online MPP tracking
for each MFC and high (up to 85%) power conversion efficiency. Also,
the PMS prevents voltage reversal by disconnecting an MFC from the
circuit whenever its voltage drops below a predefined threshold. The
effectiveness of the proposed PMS is verified through simulations
and experimental runs.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Microbial
fuel cells (MFCs) generate electrical energy from organic
wastes including wastewater and marine sediments by using electroactive
microorganisms.1 The MFC usually consists
of anode and cathode compartments separated by a proton exchange membrane,
although membraneless and air-breathing cathode configurations are
also known.2 The electroactive bacteria
at the anode oxidize the organic matter and release electrons, which
are then transferred to the cathode through an external electrical
load.3 The MFC technology offers a promising
solution for both waste treatment and sustainable energy production.4

Due to its low power density and low output
voltage, the use of
a single MFC is limited in practical applications. At its maximum
power point (MPP), the specific power density of an MFC is approximately
0.1–2.0 W m–2 with an open-circuit voltage
(OCV) at approximately 0.5–0.6 V.5 These low output power and voltage values make it difficult to directly
power most electrical loads using an MFC. For example, a typical Li-ion
battery cell requires at least 3.3 V for charging,6 and a wireless sensor usually needs a supply voltage above
3 V to transmit data.7

In order to
increase the output power and voltage of MFCs, the
surface area of the anode was increased from a few square centimeters
in laboratory-scale MFCs to several square meters in benthic8 or tubular MFCs.9 However,
this approach only increases MFC current, while output voltage remains
low. Furthermore, it is not simple to maintain the power density of
large-surface area MFCs.10 Another solution
to deal with the low output voltage of MFCs is to connect multiple
MFCs in series or in parallel to increase the output voltage or power.11 However, this configuration requires the operation
point of all MFCs to be identical so as to prevent the voltage-reversal
phenomenon, which may reduce the overall voltage of the MFC stack
to nearly a zero.12 Since the optimal operating
point of each MFC depends on several external factors such as the
pH, the concentration of the organic substrate, and the microbial
activity,13 it is difficult to keep all
MFCs at an identical operating point. To prevent the voltage reversal
problem, a method for connecting multiple MFCs in parallel together
with capacitors and relay switches was introduced.14 Although the output voltage increased, the approach could
be costly and lead to a relatively low power conversion efficiency
due to the use of multiple capacitors and switches.

One of the
most promising approaches for MFC utilization for practical
applications is through a power management system (PMS). Generally,
a PMS includes an electronic circuit made of components such as capacitors,
charge pumps, step-up converters, diodes, inductors, power switches,
and/or potentiometers. To demonstrate the operation of MFC-powered
wireless sensors, Shantaram et al.15 and
Donovan et al.16 developed PMSs based on
a standard step-up converter (MAX1797 from Maxwell Technologies) and
charge pumps. These PMSs, which aim to harvest power from a single
MFC, have low power conversion efficiency. In addition, the use of
offline maximum power point tracking (MPPT) algorithms is another
main drawback of these PMSs. Recently, a number of PMSs with several
types of step-up voltage converters have been proposed to manage multiple
MFCs in order to increase the output voltage.17−20 This electrical circuit is managed
by a control algorithm to harvest the MFCs’ energy and increase
the output voltage to an acceptable level. Such a PMS not only reaches
a higher voltage level but also maximizes the power harvested from
each MFC. A PMS based on parallel connected upconverters and a hysteresis
control algorithm to manage multiple MFCs was recently developed.21 The results obtained show that this method can
significantly increase the output voltage up to a level usable by
common electrical loads while maintaining each MFC at its own maximum
power point (MPP). An interesting PMS for controlling multiple MFCs
was introduced by Carreon-Bautista et al.22 where each MFC connects to the PMS in a sequence based on a time-interleaving
concept. Also, Costilla-Reyes et al.23 developed
another time-interleaving PMS to sequentially harvest the energy according
to each MFC power level. The output voltage of the PMS is elevated
by a standard step-up converter, BQ25505 from Texas Instruments. In
this work, the working voltage of each MFC in this PMS was kept above
half the OCV value. In another work,24 a
real-time electrical reconfiguration of MFCs in a stack halved the
time required to charge a capacitor (load) and achieved 35% higher
current generation compared to a fixed configuration.

Although
the PMS-based approach has been already investigated to
connect multiple MFCs, it still poses several challenges including
(1) implementation of real-time MPPT for each MFC, (2) high cost,
and (3) a relatively low power conversion efficiency.17 In this work, we try to overcome these challenges by introducing
an effective PMS where each MFC is connected to its corresponding
capacitor through a switch. These switches aim to control the MFCs
so that they can operate at their own MPP. In addition, the MPPT is
performed according to the estimated value of the OCV of each MFC
obtained online based on an equivalent electrical model. Since the
OCV is determined regardless of a priori knowledge of the MFC internal
parameters, the proposed control algorithm can track efficiently the
MPP of each MFC. The proposed PMS also uses an upconverter as a back-end
converter to supply higher voltage to a load. This upconverter is
modulated optimally to reduce power losses. Compared to the conventional
power management system for multiple MFCs, the proposed PMS features
several advantages: (1) it requires fewer components such as capacitors
and switches; (2) the control scheme ensures the online MPPT for all
MFCs; (3) it has a high power conversion efficiency; and (4) it is
able to monitor MFC voltage and disconnect MFC whenever the voltage
drops, which enables MFC recovery. To verify the effectiveness of
the proposed power management system, several model-based simulations
and laboratory experiments are carried out using three laboratory-scale
MFCs.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Laboratory
Setup
All experiments
were carried out in continuously fed air-cathode MFCs. Three MFCs
were constructed, each with a series of polycarbonate plates.25 The anodic chamber of each MFC retained 60 mL
of a liquid and had a headspace of 40 mL. The MFCs were equipped with
lines for an influent, effluent, and gas exit. The liquid-filled (anodic)
chamber housed the anode, which was made of a 5 mm-thick graphite
felt measuring 10 cm × 5 cm (Speer Canada, Kitchener, ON, Canada).
The air-breathing cathode, also measuring 10 cm × 5 cm, contained
manganese oxide as the oxygen-reducing catalyst (Electric Fuel Ltd.,
Bet Shemesh, Israel). Notably, a manganese oxide cathode is less costly
and provides improved long-term MFC performance as compared to a Pt-based
cathode.26,27 A detailed description of the experimental
setup can be found elsewhere.25 Also, the
setup diagram is provided in the Supporting Information (Figure S1).

The MFCs were inoculated with
5 mL of homogenized anaerobic sludge (Rougemont, QC, Canada). A stock
solution of carbon source (sodium acetate) was fed using an infusion
pump (model PHD 2000, Harvard Apparatus, Canada) at a rate of 2.5–5
mL d–1. One milliliter of a trace-metal stock solution
was added to 1 L of the dilution water. The dilution water was fed
at a rate of 146 mL d–1 using a peristaltic pump
(Cole-Parmer, Chicago, IL, U.S.A.) providing a retention time of 10
h. The stock acetate and dilution water streams were combined before
entering the anode compartment resulting in an influent acetate concentration
of 500–600 mg L–1.

2.2 Equivalent
Electrical Circuit Model
A previously proposed simple equivalent
electrical circuit model28 shown in Figure 1A was used for simulating
PMS performance. The model
considers an electromotive force (open-circuit voltage, VOC). The ohmic losses (solution resistance) are modeled
using an internal resistor, R1. In series with R1 is a branch composed of a resistor (R2) representing
activation losses and a capacitor C1, which represents
the system dynamics.

(B) Proposed
power management system for multiple MFCs.

2.3 Power Management System
The PMS developed
for simultaneous operation of multiple MFCs is shown in Figure 1B. Each MFC is connected to
a capacitor through a single pole single throw (SPST) switch (ADG801,
Analog Devices). These capacitors are connected in series so that
the voltage of all MFCs can be summed to a higher level. In addition,
a step-up converter including an inductor, an SPST switch, and a Schottky
diode (DFLS130L, Diodes Incorporated) is used to boost the output
voltage of the power converter.

PMS performance simulations
were carried out with the SimPowerSystem toolbox from Matlab (Mathworks,
Natick, MA, U.S.A.). In these simulations, the sampling time was set
to 10 μs and each MFC was modeled by a controllable DC source
representing the OCV, a resistor, and a parallel–resistor–capacitor
branch as shown in Figure 1A. Internal parameters of this equivalent electrical model
are listed in Table 1.

The PMS can track the
MPP of MFCs by using two popular approaches.
The first one is based on the MFC output power response to a perturbation
such as the perturb-and-observe (PO) method29 and extremum-seeking control (ESC) method.30 The second approach consists of maintaining the MFC voltage around
a voltage level corresponding to half of the OCV.22,31 Whenever the system includes multiple MFCs, the biggest challenge
is in determining online the OCV of each MFC without disconnecting
the circuit. In this work, we propose a novel online OCV estimation
method to perform MPPT with the second approach. This estimation method
will be described in the following section. Also, to evaluate MFC
performance, specific power output was calculated using the anode
compartment volume (0.06 L) and cathode surface area (0.005 m2).

2.4 Online Maximum Power Point
Tracking Algorithm
As shown in Figure 1B, in the PMS, the kth MFC
is connected to its corresponding
capacitor, CK via a switch Sk. This switch aims to control the capacitor voltage
at around half of the kth MFC OCV. When the switch
Sk is turned on, the capacitor Ck is charged until its voltage reaches an upper
threshold, VUk. The switch
Sk is turned off (i.e., Sk(t) = 0) whenever 1  where 2  

Here, VCk(t) and VOCk(t) are the Ck voltage and the OCV of the kth MFC, respectively,
and Δk is
the voltage variation level in the capacitor Ck.

Once all capacitors reach their corresponding upper
voltage threshold,
that is, S1, S2, and SN are all turned
off, the switch SS is turned on in order to discharge the
capacitors by connecting them to the load by means of regulating the
step-up switch SB. The switch Sk is turned on (i.e., Sk(t) = 1) when the voltage of the capacitor Ck reaches the low voltage threshold, VLk, that is, when 3  where 4  

When
the capacitor voltage VCk is within the lower and upper thresholds (i.e., VLk(t) < VCk(t) < VUk(t)), the switch state
is maintained at its previous value: 5  with TS being the sampling time.

In order to discharge the
capacitor Ck properly, the switch SS is turned on only when all switches
(Sk) are turned off: 6  

Whenever any switch
Sk is turned on,
the switch SS should be turned off in order to allow the
capacitor Ck to be charged: 7  

The output voltage, VO, is elevated
by modulating the switch SB with an optimal duty cycle D while the switch SS is turned on: 8   9  

The summary of the control flow chart for the proposed PMS is shown
in Figure 2. The control
flow aims to manage a total of N MFCs. At every sampling
time t, the switching state of Sk is determined based on the voltage of capacitor Ck. When all switches Sk are off (Sk = 0), we turn on SS and modulate SB to discharge capacitors Ck to the load.

Figure 2 Flow chart of the control logic used at
each sampling time in the
proposed PMS.

The output voltage of the system
depends on the duty cycle of the
step-up converter. In Figure 3A, an equivalent circuit of the step-up converter with the
parasitic resistances and the diode forward voltage, VF, is shown where rS is the
switch on-resistance, rD is the diode
forward resistance, rL is the equivalent
series resistance (ESR) of the inductor, rC is the ESR of the output capacitor, and R is the
load. These components are introduced to represent the power losses
affecting the converter efficiency and the voltage boost ratio. These
power losses are due to the power dissipation through the parasitic
resistances of the switch, PS, the diode, PD, the inductor, PL, and the capacitor, PC. Thus, the total
power losses, PT, in the converter is
represented by: 10  where D is
the duty cycle of the switch SB and PO is the output power of the converter. From eq 10, the converter efficiency is derived
to be 11  

Figure 3 (A)
Equivalent circuit of the step-up converter with parasitic
parameters. (B) Efficiency and boost voltage ratio of the converter.

The boost voltage ratio of the converter is defined
as follows: 12  

As shown in eqs 11 and 12, both the converter efficiency and
the boost voltage ratio depend on the duty cycle D. Figure 3B shows
the efficiency curve and the voltage boost ratio with respect to the
duty cycle. These curves have been obtained using similar converter
parameters as those used in our experimental setup (see Table 1) and VO = 3.0 V. It can be seen that an increase of the duty cycle
may lead to an increase of the voltage boost ratio whereas it leads
to a decrease of the efficiency. Therefore, a tradeoff must be found
between the desired boost ratio and the efficiency while choosing
the duty cycle. We aim at maintaining the converter efficiency higher
than 90%, and consequently, the duty cycle was set around 80%, leading
to a voltage boost ratio between 4 and 5.

2.5 Online
Estimation of MFC Open-Circuit Voltage
The most important
challenge in maintaining the MFC operation point
around half its OCV value is to determine this value despite its variation
and without disconnecting the circuit. Based on the equivalent electrical
model of the MFC shown in Figure 1A, we introduce the following OCV estimation approach.
Considering the kth MFC of the total N MFCs shown in Figure 1B, its external voltage, VMk, is expressed as follows (when switch Sk is turned off): 13  where τ = R2kC1k and VIk is the
voltage across the internal capacitor C1k when switch Sk is turned off. According
to eq 13, the OCV can
be determined by measuring three values of VMk at three different moments during the discharge
of C1k so that 14   15   16  

In eqs 14–16, the OCV is assumed to be
constant between t1 and t3. This assumption is reasonable
if the period is smaller than the time constant τ. To estimate
the OCV, the first measurement is conducted at the time when the switch
is turned off, considering this moment to be a time reference, t1 = 0. Subsequently, the second and third measurements
are performed at t2 = λ and t3 = 2λ.
This yields the following equations: 17   18   19  

From eqs 17–19, the OCV can be expressed as follows: 20  

Thus, based on eq 20, the OCV can be determined by measuring the MFC voltage at three
different moments when the switch is turned off. As a result, the
proposed OCV estimation approach provides a practical solution since
it is performed in real time and does not require identifying the
MFC internal resistance and capacitance.

2.6 Determination
of PMS Parameters
The
capacitor, Ck, plays a crucial role in
the PMS. As shown in Figure 1B, the capacitor stores the MFC power when the switch, Sk, is turned on and discharges it when the switches
Sk and SS are turned off and
on, respectively. As a result, each capacitor is able to be separately
charged by the corresponding MFC and to feed the step-up converter
by connecting in series to other capacitors. This concept enables
each MFC to operate independently whereas their voltages are summed
during discharge to help the step-up converter reach a higher voltage
output level. Since the charge and discharge time intervals depend
on the value of each capacitance, Ck,
the choice of this capacitance is critical.

Considering that
(i) the voltage drop across C1k is constant
during the charge of Ck (i.e., when Sk is turned on) and (ii) rCk ≪ R1k + R2k + rsk with rCk and rsk being the parasitic resistances in the
capacitance Ck and in the switch Sk, respectively, the voltage of Ck is 21  where tc is the time at which the switch Sk is turned on and Rk is the
total resistance
including the MFC internal resistors and the switch on-resistor, that
is 22  

The capacitor is charged until
the moment td when its voltage reaches
the upper threshold VUk. According to eq 21, the capacitor voltage at td is 23  where Δt = td – tc. From eq 23, the capacitance can be calculated using the following
equation: 24  Hence, the capacitor voltage
levels at t = tc and t = td are, respectively 25  and 26  

By substituting eqs 25 and 26 into eq 24, the capacitance
Ck can
be chosen based on the desired values of Δt and Δk: 27  

Note that,
during their discharge, all the capacitors (Ck) are connected in series. Thus, in order to
make sure that all capacitors reach their lower voltage thresholds
at the same moment, the following relationship should be satisfied: 28  

As a result,
if Δ1 is set at a fixed value, the
other voltage offsets should be calculated as follows: 29  

According to the OCVs,
the voltage variation level Δk will
be updated timely based on eq 29. For a given capacitance of capacitor
Ck, the power conversion efficiency of
the developed PMS is maximized when all MFCs are identical. However,
when the MFCs are different, the power conversion efficiency of the
PMS will be lower. The reason behind the decreased power conversion
efficiency is that the strongest MFCs must wait for the weakest MFC
to charge its respective external capacitor. Thus, to show the performance
of our developed PMS, the worst scenario (i.e., the MFCs are different)
was selected to test the system.

2.7 PMS Performance
Simulation
PMS performance
simulations were carried out using the MFC equivalent electrical model
shown in Figure 1A
with internal model parameters described in Table 1. With these parameters, the maximum power
of MFCs 1, 2, and 3 was 0.45, 0.50, and 0.55 mW, respectively. Thus,
the total maximum power of all MFCs was 1.5 mW.

Figure 4 shows the simulation results
obtained by first setting Δ2 = 5%. Using eq 29,Δ1 =
5.56% and Δ3 = 4.55% were calculated. The voltage
of MFC1 and capacitor C1 is shown in Figure 4A, whereas the switching pattern of S1 is shown in the Supporting Information (Figure S2A).

Figure 4 Simulation results of the proposed system. (A) Voltage
of MFC1
and capacitor C1. (B) Voltage of electrical load and CS.

It can be seen that the OCV is
well estimated using the proposed
estimation method. As a result, the voltage of capacitor C1 is perfectly controlled at an operating point around half of the
OCV level. While the switch S1 is being turned on, the
MFC1 charges the capacitor C1, which makes the MFC1 external
voltage (i.e., VM1) coincide with the
capacitor C1 voltage as shown in Figure 4A. The charging process is completed once
the capacitor C1 voltage reaches the upper threshold, and
the switch S1 is turned off. While the switch S1 is being turned off, the MFC1 recovers and its external voltage
increases again. The same behavior is observed for MFC2 and MFC3.
When switches S1, S2, and S3 are
all turned off, the switch SS is turned on in order to
discharge the MFCs’ power stored in capacitors C1, C2, and C3 to the electrical load (Supporting
Information, Figure S2B). By modulating
the switch of the step-up converter at a duty cycle of 80%, the load
voltage is elevated to 2.55 V, whereas the input voltage of the step-up
converter (i.e., VS) is approximately
0.6 V (Figure 4B).
As a result, the output power of the system is maintained at 1.3 mW
(0.26 W m–2 or 0.022 W L–1 based
on the cathode surface area and the anode compartment volume, respectively).
Therefore, the overall system efficiency, which is defined by the
ratio of the load power over the system maximum power (i.e., 1.5 mW),
is 86.7%. Moreover, the voltage boost ratio of the overall system 30  is evaluated to be 3.4.

In order to examine the dynamic response
of the proposed system,
in the following simulation, the OCV of each MFC was changed. The
results are shown in Figure 5. For t < 50 s, the OCVs of MFC1, MFC2,
and MFC3 were fixed at 450, 500, and 550 mV, respectively. For 50
s < t < 60 s, the OCVs of MFCs 1, 2, and 3
were increased to 550, 600, and 650 mV, respectively, prior to being
set back (at t = 60 s) to their initial levels. A
higher OCV value implies lower activation losses.32 In the electrical equivalent circuit model, mass transfer
and ohmic and activation losses are described as internal resistances
R1 and R2. Since C1k ≫ Ck, the current going through
C1k is negligible. Based on the first-order
optimality condition ( where PMFC is
the MFC output power) for a given OCV value, it can be shown that
the maximal power is extracted when the output voltage is controlled
at around half of its open-circuit voltage.22,31 The MPP algorithm constantly re-evaluates the OCV and ensures optimal
operation of each MFC. In the simulation shown in Figure 5A, the OCVs’ increase
led to an increase of the total maximum power of MFCs from 1.5 to
1.85 mW (0.37 W m–2). Note that the losses may also
affect the OCV. However, the online procedure for OCV estimation ensured
the online tracking of the maximal power point.

Figure 5 Simulation results showing
dynamic performance of (A) the proposed
PMS system and (B) power output and overall system efficiency as a
function of the voltage setpoint expressed as OCV percentage.

From Figure 5A,
it can be seen that when the values of OCVs are changed, the proposed
algorithm is able to estimate the new values. Although there is a
significant error at the time when the OCV is changed, the error lasts
for only three sampling times (30 μs). This approach to OCV
estimation results in an appropriate control of each capacitor voltage
according to the actual OCV of the MFC to which it is connected. Therefore,
the load voltage is increased from 2.55 to 2.95 V when the OCVs are
increased and then decreased from 2.95 to 2.55 V when the OCVs are
decreased. Dynamics of MFC voltages is shown in the Supporting Information
(Figure S3). These output voltage levels
result in the high overall system efficiency.

In another simulation,
to demonstrate MPPT performance, we controlled
the system at several operating points, which varied from 20 to 85%
of the OCV level. The overall power output and efficiency of the system
as a function of OCV percentage at which the MFC voltage is maintained
are plotted in Figure 5B. As expected, the power output is maximized when the MFC external
voltage is maintained at 50% its OCV. Here, the overall system efficiency
was calculated by dividing the power by the total MFCs’ maximum
power (i.e., 1.5 mW).

3 Experimental Section
3.1 Validation of the Proposed Approach
The experimental
setup used for validation consisted of three MFCs
continuously fed with acetate solution as a source of organic carbon.
The PMS is controlled using an ultralow power microcontroller (MSP430F5529,
Texas Instruments), and its parameters are set to the same values
as the ones used for the simulation (Table 1). A data acquisition board (Labjack, model
U3-LV) is used to collect the MFCs and load voltage information. In
order to verify the efficiency of the proposed PMS to track the MPP
prior to PMS testing, the power curve of each MFC was obtained by
connecting each MFC to a potentiometer and changing resistance from
50 Ω to 5 kΩ. The resulting power curves are shown in Figure 6. It can be seen
that the MPPs of MFC1, MFC2, and MFC3 are 0.4, 0.5, and 0.6 mW, leading
to a maximum power of 1.5 mW for the whole system, whereas the OCVs
of MFC1, -2, and -3 are 512, 540, and 430 mV, respectively. The OCVs
and MPPs of each MFC are different from each other since each MFC
has unique electrical characteristics due to its biological nature.
As mentioned previously, these differences were decreasing the overall
conversion efficiency of the PMS. At the same time, the test demonstrated
the PMS capacity to track the unique MPP of each MFC.

Figure 6 Experimentally measured
power curves of the three MFCs used in
experiment.

From the experimental results
of PMS testing shown in Figure 7, we can see that
the voltage of capacitors C1, C2, and C3 is controlled at around half of the corresponding OCVs, as
expected. When switches S1, S2, and S3 are turned on, the capacitors C1, C2, and
C3 are charged and their voltages are equal to their corresponding
MFC voltages as shown in Figure 7A–C. Whenever the voltage of one capacitor reaches
the upper threshold, the respective switch is turned off and the capacitor
voltage is kept constant until the switch SS is turned
on. The capacitors are discharged once the switch SS is
turned on, which enables the step-up converter to elevate the load
voltage. It can be seen from Figure 7D that the load voltage is maintained at 2.55 V, whereas
the input voltage of the step-up converter varies at approximately
0.6 V. With this voltage and a 5 kΩ load, the output power is
1.3 mW, as compared with a maximum total power output of 1.5 mW calculated
based on the power curves shown in Figure 6. Therefore, the overall system efficiency
is evaluated at 86.6%, almost the same as the one observed during
simulations since the model parameters were chosen in agreement with
experimentally measured total internal resistance and OCV values of
the three laboratory MFCs. It can be hypothesized that the high upconversion
efficiency and the near-optimal mode of operation of each MFC might
also improve the Coulombic efficiency of carbon source transformation
to electricity. Indeed, previous research showed significant improvements
in the observed Coulombic efficiency of an MFC operated under optimal
conditions.32 Long-term operation of the
proposed PMS with multiple MFCs is required to confirm this hypothesis.

3.2 Comparison with Published PMS Designs and
Sustainability Analysis
In order to highlight the advanced
features of the proposed PMS, a comparison with other published PMSs
is provided in Table 2. This comparison is based on systems with N MFCs.
In terms of the online optimization capabilities, the proposed PMS
along with the PMSs presented in14,21−23 are able to track in real-time the MPP of each MFC. The most important
feature of the PMS is the power conversion efficiency. As explained
in Section 2.5, the
proposed PMS has an efficiency of 86.6%.

a N denotes the number
of MFCs.

In a multiMFC system,
the PMS should provide a maintenance feature
enabling each MFC to disconnect from the overall system for a while
without shutting down the overall system. This requirement is reasonable
to enable MFC recovery or maintenance. This feature can be provided
by simply adding an additional switch in parallel with each MFC capacitor
(Ck), which turns on when the MFC needs
to be disconnected from the system. Here, the capacitor would be bypassed
enabling the overall system to work normally without being affected
by the disconnected MFC.

The PMS efficiency can be further improved
by optimizing the number
of MFCs connected to the upconverter during each cycle. By bypassing
one or more slow-charging MFCs in one cycle and reconnecting these
MFCs in the next cycle, the cycle duration can be reduced, although
the PMS efficiency can be reduced if some MFCs are bypassed. An online
optimization algorithm can be developed to find a compromise between
the cycle duration and the PMS efficiency.

An important feature
for real MFC applications is the self-sustainability
of the system in terms of electrical power. In other words, it means
that the PMS should be able to manage the MFC system without requiring
any additional external power source. In order to meet this requirement,
the power consumption of the PMS should be much smaller than the total
power generated by MFCs. Owing to its ease of configuration, the digital-based
PMS has been usually used to manage MFC power where online MPPT algorithms
could be implemented more easily compared with the analog-based ones.33 In order to minimize the power consumed by PMSs,
extreme low-power (LP) microcontrollers are preferable. Table S1 in the Supporting Information lists
the most popular extreme LP microcontrollers on the market. There
are four big manufacturers in the microcontroller chip segment including
STMicroelectronics, Texas Instruments, Microchip, and Analog Devices.
The power consumption of these extreme LP microcontrollers is of the
order of a few milliwatts. For example, MSP430-Mixed Signal from Texas
Instruments requires a minimal power of 7.3 mW in its active mode
(at a frequency of 14 MHz). In addition, the minimum supply voltage
of microcontrollers is usually higher than 1.6 V, which shows the
necessity of using a step-up converter to boost the voltage of MFCs
to an adequate level for microcontroller use. However, popular step-up
converters used in MFC applications (such as BQ25504 and LTC3105)
have a conversion efficiency of approximately 60%. Therefore, MFCs
must generate 12.2 mW to power a PMS using a MSP430-Mixed Signal microcontroller.
For real applications, it is desirable that the power consumption
of PMSs be less than 10% of the total power generated by the MFCs.
In other words, MFCs should provide at least 122 mW for real applications.
Previous studies have demonstrated that the power density of MFCs
can reach up to 70 mW L–1.34,35 Consequently, an MFC with an anodic compartment volume of 1.75 L
could attain the required power level of 122 mW.

4 Conclusions
This work presents a high-efficiency PMS for
operation of multiple
MFCs. Each MFC is connected to a capacitor through a switch that controls
the operating point of this MFC at its respective MPP. In addition,
the MPPT is performed using an online estimation of the OCV based
on the MFC equivalent electrical circuit model. Since the OCV is estimated
without identifying the MFC internal parameters, the proposed control
algorithm can track effectively the MPP of each MFC. In order to elevate
the output voltage, the proposed PMS uses a step-up converter to supply
a higher voltage to a load. This upconverter is modulated optimally
to reduce power loss. Compared to conventional PMSs for multiple MFCs,
the proposed PMS shows several advanced features. The control scheme
ensures the online MPPT for all MFCs and provides high power conversion
efficiency of up to 86.6%. In addition, the proposed PMS could be
easily enhanced by including additional switches to enable MFC maintenance.
The effectiveness of the proposed power management system was verified
through several simulations and experiments using three MFCs. In order
to improve the efficiency of the proposed PMS, future work needs to
focus on bypassing slow-charging MFCs and developing an online algorithm
for optimizing the number of MFCs participating in each cycle.
