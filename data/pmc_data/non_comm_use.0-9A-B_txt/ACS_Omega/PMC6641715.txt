Employing six cationic
water-soluble organic dye molecules as probes,
we have attempted to qualitatively understand the factors that govern
the attraction between such molecules and the anionic water-soluble
host, octa acid (OA). Examination of the competitive host–guest
complexation between cucurbit[8]uril (CB[8]) and OA using absorption
and emission spectroscopy revealed that the dye molecules included
within CB[8] could be “pulled out” by OA. However, an
order of magnitude higher concentration of OA was required to shift
the equilibrium toward OA, suggesting that attraction between the
anionic host OA and the cationic dye molecules such as cresyl violet
perchlorate and methylene blue is weaker than the hydrophobic and
cation–dipolar interaction between these dye molecules and
CB[8]. The importance of Coulombic attraction between OA and dye molecules
is also revealed by monomer-to-dimer conversion upon addition of OA
to an aqueous solution of monomeric dye molecules. Under conditions
where the dye-to-OA ratio is high, freely dissolved monomeric dye
molecules are attracted to the exterior of OA and aggregate as dimers
on the exterior wall of OA. On the other hand, at high ratios of OA
to dye molecules, the dye molecules adsorb as monomers on the exterior
of OA. Thus, the monomer-to-dimer ratio in aqueous solution can be
controlled by adjusting the ratio of dye to OA molecules. The results
presented are of value in qualitatively understanding the relative
binding properties of ionic guests with ionic hosts. Studies are qualitative
in nature, and further detailed quantitative studies planned for the
future are likely to provide deeper understanding of the interaction
between water-soluble dye molecules, OA, and CB.

Introduction
The use of dyes as
sensitizers in photographic processes and printing
technologies,1,2 as laser dyes,3,4 as
a component in solar energy conversion systems5−9 and in chemotherapy10,11 point to their
varied role in current times.4,12,13 Understanding and controlling the dye aggregation are necessary
for their utilization in coloration of materials such as fibers, in
photochemical processes such as photography and in medical applications
such as photodynamic therapy. H-aggregation, a common intermolecular
association, has been extensively investigated both in solution and
in confined environments using various electronic spectroscopic methods
for many years.14−21 The dye molecules in these systems stack in parallel, face-to-face
fashion to produce dimers and higher order aggregates in a sandwichlike
arrangement. Such a molecular aggregation depends on several factors
including dye concentration and structure, solvent, temperature, and
pH. The excitonic coupling between the transition dipoles on neighboring
chromophores splits the electronic transitions into higher and lower
energy components.14−17 The allowed exclusive transition to a higher excited state for the
H-aggregated dimer leads to its blue-shifted absorption, relative
to the isolated monomers. The H-aggregated dimer is usually a poor
emitter because of its enhanced intersystem crossing in the excited
state.22,23 In recent years, modulation of dye aggregation
through encapsulation in the cages of supramolecular assemblies has
attracted much attention.18−20,24 Formation of host–guest complexes between organic dye molecules
and host cucurbit[n]uril (CB[n])
are classic examples.25−30 Depending on the guest size and preferred orientation, CBs can accommodate
one or two dye molecules to form 1:1 or 1:2 (host-to-guest) complexes
through ion–dipole interaction.31−34 Hydrophobic interaction is also
likely to play a role for hydrophobic organic guest molecules. In
this work, aiming at assessing the strength of Coulombic attraction
between the host octa acid (OA) and six cationic dyes (Scheme 1) in relation to ion–dipole
interaction between cucurbit[8]uril (CB[8]) and dyes, we have monitored
the change in their absorption and emission spectra in the presence
of the above hosts. Differences in absorption maxima of the dyes under
different conditions have enabled this study.

Molecules
Results and Discussion
We have examined the absorption and emission characteristics of
six water-soluble organic dyes18,35−48 (Scheme 1) in aqueous
solution, in borate buffer, and in the presence of hosts OA and/or
CB[8] in borate buffer. Because all six dyes exhibit a similar behavior,
results of two, namely, cresyl violet perchlorate (CVP) and methylene
blue (MB) are presented and discussed below. Results from the other
four [thionin acetate (TA), acridine orange (AO), toluidine blue (TBO),
and azure B (AB)] are included as Supporting Information. Because all studies are conducted in borate buffer solution (pH
≈ 9), we recorded the absorption and emission spectra in borate
buffer and compared them with those in aqueous solution. Except for
the decreased absorption intensity of the dyes in the buffered solution
relative to that in neutral solution, no other changes were noticeable.

Interaction
of CVP and MB with OA
Figures 1 and 2 show the effect of OA
on the absorption and fluorescence spectra
of CVP (1.0 × 10–5 M) and MB (8.2 × 10–6 M) in borate buffer solution at room temperature.
The main absorption maxima of CVP and MB in the absence of OA were
at 588 and 664 nm. These were attributed to the monomers of the dyes
present in buffer solution. Addition of OA to the solution containing
the dyes resulted in a decrease in the monomer absorption and a rise
in the dimer absorption. The sharp decrease in the monomer absorption
of both dyes with the addition of OA implies the equilibrium shift
of the system toward the dimer with a corresponding quenching of their
fluorescence as both the dye dimers are nonemissive. The decrease
of the intensity of absorption and the shift of maxima to a shorter
wavelength occurred continuously until the OA concentration reached
1.8 × 10–6 M OA (for CVP) and 1.0 × 10–5 M (for MB). Further addition resulted in the decrease
of dimer absorption (543 nm for CVP and 600 nm for MB) with a concomitant
increase in monomer absorption (602 nm for CVP and 670 nm for MB);
the fluorescence intensity showed a similar pattern that reached a
peak at OA concentrations of 1.7 × 10–4 M for
CVP and 1.2 × 10–4 M for MB.

deaggregation = 1.2 × 10–4 M. (b) Fluorescence
spectra: λmax for the monomer before addition of
OA = 692 nm and after addition of OA = 702 nm; the initial [OA] =

with OA (in 10 mM buffer) at room temperature. The black lines represent
the decrease in absorbance/emission, and the red lines represent the
increase in absorbance/emission after the turning point.

The above changes in absorption and emission spectra
are a reflection
of the changes in the monomer–dimer equilibrium caused by OA.
We believe that the model outlined below accounts for the above spectral
changes. Under our experimental conditions, in the absence of OA,
the absorption and emission characteristics of the dye molecules are
reflective of them remaining mostly as monomers. At early stages of
OA addition, as the dye molecules outnumber OA, aggregation (dimers)
due to Coulombic interaction between oppositely charged host and guest
molecules occurs around a limited number of OA molecules. Thus, upon
addition of small amounts of OA, the equilibrium shifted from monomers
to dimers, the latter being present on the exterior walls of the host
OA. Upon further addition, the aggregates dissociate to monomers,
resulting in a one-to-one interaction between the dye and OA molecules.
The spectral changes corresponding to dimer-to-monomer conversion
upon further addition of OA are consistent with the aggregated dye
molecule redistributing themselves amongst the large number of OA
molecules. All six dyes studied showed such a behavior (Figures S1–S4). The observed small red
shifts in the λmax of the absorption/fluorescence
for all six dyes upon addition of OA are presented in Table 1. Interestingly, the absorption
maxima of monomers are different for the ones adsorbed on the OA surface
and the ones that are free. Scheme 2 is a cartoon depiction of this phenomenon. It is clear
that with judicial choice of the concentration of the host OA, one
can control the monomer–dimer equilibrium in aqueous solution.
Luckily, the difference in absorption maxima allowed us to infer this
phenomenon.

Although the above experiments confirmed that the
cationic dye
molecules are attracted to the anionic OA, they do not provide any
indication whether the dye molecules are located at the exterior surface
or within the cavitand. To probe whether the dye molecule–OA
interaction occurs on the exterior of the OA (Coulombic interaction)
or within the cavitand (hydrophobic and Coulombic interaction), we
examined the dye interaction with OA capsules (made up of two molecules
of OA) enclosing a guest molecule. Such a OA capsular assembly where
the guest is already included capsules can offer only its exterior
containing 16 carboxylate anions for interaction with the dye. Dehydro-epi-androsterone (DHAS) strongly binds to OA to form a very
stable capsular complex, we depict as DHAS@OA2.49 In this case, only the exterior walls are available
for interaction with dye molecules. Figure 3 shows the change in UV and fluorescence
spectra of CVP when titrated with DHAS@OA2. The spectral
behavior on titration of CVP with DHAS@OA2 closely resembled
that with OA alone, as shown in Figure 1. Similar to that upon addition of OA, the monomers
present in solution were converted to dimers that, upon further addition
of DHAS@OA2, became monomers. Comparison of the spectral
changes with OA and DHAS@OA2 points to the purely electrostatic
interaction between the dye and the OA, with the hydrophobic interior
of the OA cavity playing no role.

and the red lines represent the increase in absorbance/emission after

Estimation of the Binding
Strength of OA with Organic Dyes in
Relation to Their Binding to Cavitand CB[8]
Having inferred
that Coulombic interaction is one of the main factors that attract
organic dyes to OA, we proceeded to compare it with the electrostatic
interaction between the negatively polarized portals of CB[8] and
the positive center of dyes. On the basis of the internal space of
the CBs, we anticipated CB[8] to accommodate two dye molecules. Further,
all dyes being cationic, we speculated that they would be held within
CB[8] through interaction with the polarized portals made up of carbonyl
chromophores. We wished to explore the possibility of OA attracting
the dye molecules that are included in the cavities of CB[8]. Because
the dyes within CB[8] would be present as dimers, we argued that upon
exiting the CB[8], they would adsorb on the exterior walls of OA either
as dimers or monomers. If they adsorb as monomers, we surmised that
dimer-to-monomer conversion could be monitored by their characteristic
absorption and emission characteristics. As expected, on gradual addition
of CB[8] to an aqueous solution of CVP at room temperature, the absorption
of the CVP monomer decreased sharply while that of the dimer increased
and blue-shifted from 588 to 546 nm for CVP (Figure 4a). A similar observation was made in the case of MB, where
the monomer maximum at 664 nm shifted to dimer maximum at 622 nm (Figure 5a) with a corresponding
quenching of the fluorescence of monomers (Figures 4b and 5b). The results
from all other four dyes that showed a behavior similar to those of
CVP and MB are presented in the Supporting Information (Figures S5–S8). The absorption maxima for all six dyes included
within CB[8] tabulated in Table 1 are consistent with our expectation of the dyes forming
a 2:1 complex with CB[8].

× 10–6 M titrated with CB[8] at room temperature
showing a decrease in absorbance/emission on addition of CB[8].

The inclusion of the dyes as dimers
within CB[8] gave us an opportunity
to examine the relative binding abilities of CB[8] and OA with the
dyes. To probe this possibility, OA was introduced into a solution
containing dyes included within CB[8]. As illustrated in Figure 6a, upon addition
of OA, the absorption maximum of CVP continuously shifted toward the
monomer (604 nm). Consistent with the appearance of monomer, the fluorescence
of CVP also recovered (Figure 6b). A similar observation was made also in the case of MB
(Figure 7). The absorption
spectra shown in Figures 8 and 9 for the remaining dyes clearly
show that there is an isosbestic point upon sequential addition of
CB[8] and OA. These support the notion that there is a direct conversion
from dimer to monomer when OA is introduced into the solution of the
dye–CB[8] complex. This is different from the earlier observation
during the addition of OA to the solution containing only dyes (Figures 1 and 2). In this case, depending on the concentration of OA, the
dye molecules remained as either monomer or dimer. The fact that the
dye molecules present within CB[8] are attracted to OA suggests that
the Columbic interaction between OA and the dyes is comparable to
the interaction between the negatively polarized carbonyl groups present
at the portals of CB and the dye. The fact that almost an order of
magnitude higher concentration of dye is required to attract the dye
from CB[8] suggests that the former is weaker than the forces that
hold dyes within CB[8]. In the case of CB[8], in addition to the interaction
between polarized portals and the cationic dyes, hydrophobic interactions
may also be involved. The visualized model for the displacement of
the dye molecules from the cavity of CB[8] is illustrated in a cartoon
fashion in Scheme 3.

followed by OA addition at room temperature. The red lines in the

lines represent the increase in absorbance on addition of OA. In emission
spectra, the black lines represent the CVP@CB[8] complex, and the

of OA.

and the red lines stand for increase in the emission intensity upon

Scheme 3 Cartoon Representations of the Probable Mechanism of the Formation
of the Dimer in CB[8] Followed by Formation of the Monomer in the
Presence of Host OA
The absorption spectra presented above clearly show that
dye molecules
present as monomers in aqueous solution can be converted to dimers
upon addition of a small amount of OA. Further increase of OA converts
the dimers into monomers. These processes involve multiple weak forces.
Detailed understanding requires careful binding studies and isothermal
calorimetric measurements. The data in hand do not allow us to make
any statements that require quantitative measurements. The more interesting
observation relates to the conversion of monomer to dimer upon inclusion
within CB[8]. From the absorption spectra reported in Figures 4, 5, 8, and 9, it is clear
that the monomer-to-dimer conversion is clean upon addition of CB[8].
Given that the hydrophobicity of the dye molecules investigated here
is not all the same and the structures are slightly different, not
all are expected to respond to CB[8] in an identical manner. In fact,
careful examination of the figures reveals that amounts of CB[8] required
to quantitatively convert monomers into dimers are different. Quantitative
measurement of binding constants would be useful, which is planned
for the future.

The most important aspect of the study was concerned
with understanding
the factors involved in binding of the dyes to OA relative to CB[8].
Examination of Figures 7–9 reveals that even after the addition
of excess OA (10 times the concentration of CB[8]), almost 50% of
the dye molecules remained within CB[8]. This suggests that given
a chance, the dye molecules prefer CB[8] over OA. This could be due
to the fact that inclusion within CB[8] is favored by hydrophobic
interaction in addition to cation–dipolar interaction. Interaction
with OA is facilitated only by Coulombic interaction, and when attached
to the exterior of OA, the hydrophobic dye will be exposed to the
aqueous exterior. We are aware that quantitative measurements of binding
constants are essential to fully understand the forces that hold the
dye molecules within CB[8] and on the surface of OA. With data in
hand, any speculation would be premature and risky. Quantitative measurements
of relative binding are planned for the future.

Conclusions
Organic dye molecules absorbing in the visible region have a great
potential as sensitizers during visible light photocatalysis, a topic
of considerable current interest. Water-soluble OA with a well-defined
internal cavity has been established to include a variety of structurally
diverse, reactive organic molecules. The current study was undertaken
to establish the feasibility of bringing a water-soluble organic dye
closer to an OA-encapsulated organic molecule so that selective photoreaction
could be conducted through visible light activation. The results presented
here have established that water-soluble cationic dye molecules can
be adsorbed on the exterior of OA molecules. By controlling the ratio
of dye and OA molecules, it should be possible to have the dyes as
monomers at the exterior of OA. Coulombic attraction between the negatively
charged OA and the positively charged dye is likely the driving force
for the attraction. More importantly, at low dye-to-OA ratios, the
dye molecules are adsorbed as monomers. The photophysically active
monomeric dye molecules can thus serve as sensitizers to initiate
photoreactions within OA through energy- and electron-transfer processes.
We plan to exploit this feature in our studies on visible light-catalyzed
supramolecular chemistry.
