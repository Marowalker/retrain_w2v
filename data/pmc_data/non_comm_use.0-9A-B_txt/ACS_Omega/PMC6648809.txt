A stable porous metal–organic
framework (MOF), Zr-diaminostilbenedicarboxylate
(Zr-DASDCA), was synthesized and modified with oxalyl chloride (OC)
or terephthaloyl chloride (TC) to introduce various functional groups
onto the Zr-DASDCA. Both pristine and functionalized Zr-DASDCAs, together
with activated carbon, were used as a potential carrier for ibuprofen
(IBU) storage and delivery. Zr-DASDCAs, especially the modified ones
(OC-Zr-DASDCA and TC-Zr-DASDCA), showed competitive results in IBU
delivery. Specifically, the release rate in phosphate-buffered saline
solution at pH 7.4 was nearly constant (R2 ≈ 0.98) for up to 10 days, which would be very effective
in IBU dosing to the human body. Moreover, the release rate could
be controlled by changing the pH of the releasing solution. The rate
of IBU release from both pristine and modified Zr-DASDCAs at pH 7.4
and 3.0 was also explained with a few interactions such as H-bonding
and electrostatic repulsion, together with the relative pore size
of the Zr-DASDCAs. Therefore, the results suggested that functionalization
of MOFs via postsynthetic modification, especially with OC and TC,
to introduce various functional groups onto MOFs is an effective approach
to not only reducing the release rate of IBU but also inducing a constant
release of IBU for as long as 10 days.

1 Introduction
Metal–organic
frameworks (MOFs)1−4 are an advanced class of fascinating
porous materials that have attracted the attention of researchers
because of their simple synthesis, exclusive characteristics, facile
modification, and potential applications.5−9 Various approaches,10,11 including
functionalization, have been widely used in the past decades to enhance
the performance of MOFs.12−14 Postsynthetic modification (PSM)
is considered to be one of the most attractive strategies to introduce
additional functional groups onto MOFs because it involves simple
and effective processes.15,16 MOFs with amino groups
have been reported to be easily modified to introduce different functionalities
via covalent PSM.17−19 For example, amino-MOFs were modified covalently
with various reagents such as aldehydes,20 acetic anhydride,21 phenyl isocyanate,22 polyethyleneimine,23 and peptide coupling reagents.24 However,
the covalent PSM of many microporous MOFs might be hindered by their
low stability and small pore size.

Among MOFs, zirconium-MOFs
(Zr-MOFs) usually possess excellent
chemical, thermal, and water stability because of strong Zr–O
bonds and a stable secondary building unit.25,26 For example, an amino-functionalized Zr-MOF, Zr-diaminostilbenedicarboxylate
(Zr-DASDCA, also known as JLU-Liu36 or UBMOF-8 and composed of robust
Zr6O4(OH)4 clusters), is stable and
contains large pores,27,28 rendering it suitable for PSM.
Moreover, functionalized Zr-MOFs are very attractive because of their
potential applications, especially in biomedical fields and drug delivery.29,30 Therefore, the possible functionalization of Zr-MOFs, especially
NH2-functionalized Zr-MOFs, through covalent modification
might be interesting and warrants further research because it potentially
represents a simple process to introduce additional functionalities
onto MOFs.

Ibuprofen (IBU, 4-isobutyl-α-methylphenylacetic
acid) is
one of the most consumed nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in the
world.31 IBU is a well-defined drug with
a molecular size of ∼1.03 × 0.53 nm and is commonly used
as a model drug for delivery.31 The typical
therapeutic range and toxic level of IBU in human blood are approximately
10–50 mg·L–1 and greater than 250 mg·L–1, respectively.31,32 An overdose of IBU
adversely affects the nervous system, respiratory tract, and gastrointestinal
tract and leads to renal failure.31 Therefore,
controlled release of IBU from a suitable IBU-loaded carrier is required.
Several porous materials such as mesoporous and nanoporous silica,33 polymeric materials,34,35 titania nanotubes,36 mesoporous carbon,31 bionanocomposites,37 and MOFs38−43 are commonly applied for IBU delivery. Among these materials, MOFs
are attractive because they enable a high loading of IBU (because
of feature-specific interactions between the drug and carrier9,44), even though polymeric carriers45,46 showed very
high loading (∼80%) for some anticancer drugs. Moreover, in
the case of controlled drug delivery, the pore size and functionality
of carriers strongly affect cellular uptake and subsequent delivery
or transportation of a drug into the human body.47 Therefore, delivery of IBU from functionalized MOFs, especially
Zr-MOFs, might be interesting and should be researched further, given
the possibilities of adequate loadings and controlled release.

Herein, we report a postsynthetic modification of a NH2-Zr-MOF (Zr-DASDCA) with oxalyl chloride (OC) and terephthaloyl chloride
(TC) to introduce carboxylic, phenyl, and amide functional groups
onto MOFs. Because of the low toxicity of Zr and carboxylic acids,
the functionalized MOFs (named OC-Zr-DASDCA and TC-Zr-DASDCA, respectively)
were used to store/deliver IBU.9,48 Zr-DASDCAs in both
pristine and modified forms showed a much higher IBU loading and slower
release of IBU compared with commercial activated carbon (AC). Importantly,
OC-Zr-DASDCA and TC-Zr-DASDCA exhibited nearly constant release (with
slow rate) of IBU in 10 days, unlike pristine Zr-DASDCA and AC. Moreover,
the release rate of IBU from modified Zr-DASDCAs could be controlled
by changing the pH of the solution for delivery.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Characterization of Carriers
The
XRD patterns of Zr-DASDCA with and without modification are shown
in Figure 1a. The XRD
patterns of the pristine and modified MOFs are in agreement with the
simulated pattern for Zr-DASDCA, certifying not only the successful
synthesis of pristine Zr-DASDCA but also the structural integrity
of the Zr-DASDCA during modifications. The presence of different functional
groups on the MOFs was confirmed by the FTIR spectra (Figure 1b). The pristine and modified
Zr-DASDCAs showed absorption bands at 1257 and 1430 cm–1, which were assigned as the C–N stretching vibrations of
the MOFs.27,49,50 The spectrum
of the pristine Zr-DASDCA also showed a N–H wagging band at
∼764 cm–1; this band was less intense in
the case of OC-Zr-DASDCA and TC-Zr-DASDCA because of the introduction
of additional functionalities on the −NH2 group
via PSM,50,51 as shown in Scheme 1 for OC-Zr-DASDCA. Moreover, the existence
of a broad band at ∼1740 cm–1 affirms the
presence of free −COOH groups50,52 in both OC-Zr-DASDCA
and TC-Zr-DASDCA as a result of the modification. Additionally, the
degree of modification of the MOFs was calculated on the basis of
the total quantity of −COOH groups present in the studied MOFs,
which were measured by acid–base titration. As shown in Table 2, the total amount
of −COOH groups in OC-Zr-DASDCA or TC-Zr-DASDCA was much higher
than that in pristine Zr-DASDCA because of the modifications. The
degrees of functionalization in OC-Zr-DASDCA and TC-Zr-DASDCA were
56 and 43%, respectively.

The simulated
XRD pattern of Zr-DASDCA is also shown in (a) for comparison.

The nitrogen adsorption isotherms
and pore size distributions of
the Zr-DASDCAs are shown in Figure 2a,b, respectively. The BET surface areas and pore volumes
of the studied materials, as calculated from the N2 isotherms,
are summarized in Table 1. The porosity of modified Zr-DASDCAs was reduced after functionalization
of the pristine Zr-DASDCA because of the attachment of additional
functional groups onto the MOF surface.53 The pore size of the pristine MOF was ∼1.3 nm, consistent
with the previously reported result;27 however,
the pore size of the Zr-DASDCA decreased after modification and exhibited
the order pristine Zr-DASDCA > OC-Zr-DASDCA > TC-Zr-DASDCA.
The order
of these pore sizes can be explained on the basis of the size of extra
functional groups on the modified Zr-DASDCAs. Moreover, the morphology
of the Zr-DASDCAs together with AC was studied by using electron microscopy.
The SEM images presented in Figure S2 were
similar to earlier reports27,28 and showed that the
morphology of modified Zr-DASDCAs did not change during modification
with OC and TC.

size distributions of Zr-DASDCAs.

2.2 Adsorption of IBU
The prepared MOFs
or commercial AC was employed separately for IBU loading through adsorption.
The loaded quantities of IBU over the studied materials were examined
for a contact period of 6 to 24 h (q6h–q24h). The performances of the
studied materials for IBU adsorption are shown in Figure 3. Interestingly, OC-Zr-DASDCA
adsorbed a greater amount of IBU than pristine Zr-DASDCA, even though
OC-Zr-DASDCA possessed a lower surface area than the pristine sample.
The adsorption isotherms obtained from a wide range of initial IBU
concentrations (2000–5000 mg·L–1) over
the studied materials and Langmuir plots54 for IBU isotherms are shown in Figure S3. Langmuir parameters54 such as the maximum
adsorption capacities (Q0), b-values, and correlation coefficients (R2) are presented in Table 3. The OC-Zr-DASDCA, Zr-DASDCA, TC-Zr-DASDCA, and AC showed Q0 values of 455, 434, 370, and 185 mg·g–1, respectively. The results for b-values are also agreeable with the tendency of the Q0 values. Alternatively, the IBU adsorption was the most
favorable over the OC-Zr-DASDCA among the tested adsorbents.

concentration of IBU was 5000 mg·L–1 in ethanol.

of IBU in MOF)/(weight of IBU + MOF)] × 100%

The successful loading of IBU on
OC-Zr-DASDCA was confirmed by
the FTIR analysis, as shown in Figure 4a. Several characteristic bands of IBU were detected
in the spectrum of IBU@OC-Zr-DASDCA, ensuring the successful loading
of IBU on the OC-Zr-DASDCA. The crystalline structure of the studied
MOFs was preserved well after the encapsulation of IBU, as shown in Figure S4a, certifying the structural integrity
of the studied MOFs during and after loading of the IBU. Moreover,
the BET surface areas and pore volumes of IBU-loaded MOFs were determined
from nitrogen adsorption isotherms; the results are shown in Figure S4b. The results, as summarized in Table S1, disclose that the porosities of the
MOFs severely decreased after IBU loading, also indicating the successful
encapsulation of IBU onto the MOFs’ cavities. Similar results
have been reported for the loading of IBU onto mesoporous carbon31 and an MOF.38

Figure 4 (a) FTIR spectra
of IBU and OC-Zr-DASDCA before and after loading
of IBU and (b) TGA results for Zr-DASDCA and OC-Zr-DASDCA before and
after loading of IBU.

The amounts of IBU loaded onto the MOFs were determined by
TGA.
From the TGA patterns shown in Figure 4b, three weight losses were identified at temperatures
of ∼100, 200–260, and 450–600 °C. The first
weight loss is attributed to the removal of physisorbed ethanol/water.
The second weight loss might be volatilization of the loaded IBU (boiling
point, 157 °C). The last one is attributed to destruction of
the MOFs.38,41 On the basis of the TGA results, the loaded
amounts of IBU on pristine Zr-DASDCA and OC-Zr-DASDCA were ∼20
and 26%, respectively (Figure 3); these results are consistent with the values calculated
using the quantities obtained from adsorption for 24 h and reported
in Table 3.55 Moreover, the loading capacities (wt %) of Zr-DASDCAs
were very similar to those reported for other MOFs, as summarized
in Table S2, excluding the Cr-containing
MOFs (especially highly porous MIL-101(Cr)), which might be not suitable
for the human body given the toxicity of chromium.9

The adsorption of various organics, including drug
and biomolecules,
has previously been explained with various adsorption mechanisms.56−60 The amount of any adsorbate adsorbed onto a porous adsorbent usually
depends on the surface area of the adsorbent in the absence of a special
interaction, excluding van der Waals interaction.61 The obtained results show that the OC-Zr-DASDCA has a higher q24h for IBU adsorption than the pristine Zr-DASDCA
by 9%, even though OC-Zr-DASDCA possesses a lower surface area (14%
less) than pristine Zr-DASDCA. Therefore, simple van der Waals interaction,
which is mainly dependent on the surface area of the adsorbent, might
not be the sole mechanism by which IBU adsorbs onto OC-Zr-DASDCA.
The decreased pore size of OC-Zr-DASDCA compared with that of pristine
Zr-DASDCA might render it more suitable for IBU adsorption. Tailoring
of the pore size (with tetraethyl orthosilicate-modified MIL-125-NH2) has been demonstrated to be highly effective for drug delivery,
especially in the case of IBU release.40 Moreover, on the basis of the surface area, TC-Zr-DASDCA also showed
increased adsorption or loading of IBU compared with pristine Zr-DASDCA
(Figure 3b). The competitive
loading of IBU onto TC-Zr-DASDCA might also be explained by reduced
pore size. Even though an explanation of why the TC-Zr-DASDCA adsorbed
less IBU (based on the surface area) than OC-Zr-DASDCA is not straightforward,
the presence of a bulky phenyl ring (that might hinder the adsorption
of IBU) onto TC-Zr-DASDCA and further reduction of the pore size (Figure 2b) might be some
of the reasons.

2.3 Release of IBU from Loaded
Carriers
The release of IBU from IBU-loaded AC or MOFs was
examined using
a PBS buffer solution (0.01 M at pH 7.4) for up to 10 days, as shown
in Figure 5. The rapid
release of IBU (∼70% of loaded IBU in 1 day) from IBU@AC was
observed, similar to the results with mesoporous carbon.31 This kind of rapid or burst release of drug
molecules has been considered pharmacologically harmful and economically
inefficient.62−64 The rapid release of IBU from AC within a short time
confirms that the loading of IBU on AC is mainly dependent on physical
interaction or van der Waals interaction.65 This result is easily explained by the fact that AC has a lower
concentration of functional groups than Zr-DASDCAs. Moreover, the
relatively large pore size of AC66 might
be one of the reasons for rapid release or diffusion. In contrast,
as shown in Figure 5, the release rates of IBU from Zr-DASDCAs are relatively low (especially
from modified MOFs), suggesting that the interaction between IBU and
Zr-DASDCAs involves not only physisorption but also chemisorption.
Approximately one-half of the loaded IBU was released in ∼3.0,
5.5, and 6.0 days from pristine Zr-DASDCA, OC-Zr-DASDCA, and TC-Zr-DASDCA,
respectively, suggesting a slight difference in interaction between
IBU and the Zr-DASDCAs.

Figure 5 IBU release profiles from IBU-loaded AC and
Zr-DASDCAs in PBS buffer
(0.01 M) solution at pH 7.4.

Importantly, compared with pristine Zr-DASDCA, the OC-Zr-DASDCA
and TC-Zr-DASDCA exhibit slower and controlled release (or nearly
constant release) of IBU, which is very significant for effective
drug delivery.38,67 The correlation coefficient (R2) values for IBU delivery from IBU@Zr-DASDCA,
IBU@OC-Zr-DASDCA, and IBU@TC-Zr-DASDCA are 0.914, 0.988, and 0.976,
respectively, confirming that OC-Zr-DASDCA and TC-Zr-DASDCA exhibited
nearly constant release for as long as 10 days. The controlled release
of IBU from OC-Zr-DASDCA and TC-Zr-DASDCA might be explained by the
reduced pore size and specific chemical interactions (see below).

To understand the specific interaction and controlled release of
IBU from pristine and modified MOFs in the human body, the effects
of pH on IBU release from IBU-loaded Zr-DASDCAs were studied. As shown
in Figure 6, the delivery
or release rate of IBU from IBU@OC-Zr-DASDCA or IBU@TC-Zr-DASDCA decreased
considerably with decreasing solution pH (from pH 7.4 to 3.0). This
result differs from that for IBU@Zr-DASDCA, which showed only a slightly
decreased delivery rate at pH 3.0 compared with that at pH 7.4.

Figure 6 Effect of pH
on the IBU release rate from IBU-loaded (a) Zr-DASDCA,
(b) OC-Zr-DASDCA, and (c) TC-Zr-DASDCA.

The fast release of IBU from pristine Zr-DASDCA (compared
with
modified Zr-DASDCAs), as shown in Figure 6, at the two pH conditions (especially at
pH 3.0), might be primarily because of the relatively large pore size.
On the contrary, the decreased IBU release rates from OC-Zr-DASDCA
and TC-Zr-DASDCA at pH 3.0 (Figure 6b,c) might be due to small pores and favorable interaction
(via H-bonding, which has been often observed in adsorption over MOFs56,57) between IBU and OC-Zr-DASDCA or TC-Zr-DASDCA, as shown in Scheme 2 (left, for OC-Zr-DASDCA).
The IBU release rate has already been reported to decrease with decreasing
pore size40 and decreasing pH.68 At a high pH value of 7.4, there might be a
repulsive interaction (rather than H-bonding) between carboxylate
anions because of facile deprotonation of both −COOH groups
of IBU and OC-Zr-DASDCA or TC-Zr-DASDCA (since the pKa value of the −COOH group is ∼4.969). Even though H-bonding between −COO– of IBU and −NH– of OC-Zr-DASDCA or TC-Zr-DASDCA
can be expected, such interaction might not be easy given the position
of −NH–, whose interaction with IBU is sterically hindered.
The observed release rates of loaded IBU from OC-Zr-DASDCA or TC-Zr-DASDCA
at pH 7.4 (which is similar to the rates from pristine Zr-DASDCA at
the two pH conditions) might be because of a tradeoff between small
pores (which can decrease the release rate) and repulsive interactions
(which can increase the release rate). The possible interactions of
IBU with pristine Zr-DASDCA and OC-Zr-DASDCA at pH 3.0 and 7.4 are
shown in Scheme S2 and Scheme 2, respectively. Finally, the
possible destruction of Zr-DASDCA (especially at pH 7.4) after several
days in PBS solution cannot be ruled out since, recently, it has been
reported that Zr-MOFs such as UiO-66 are not very stable even in the
condition of pH 7.70 Further work is required
to understand the possible contribution of destruction of Zr-DASDCAs
in the delivery of IBU.

Scheme 2 Plausible Interactions To Explain the Release
of IBU from OC-Zr-DASDCA
at pH 3.0 (left) and 7.4 (right)
Therefore, modified Zr-DASDCAs can be suggested as effective
carriers
for IBU on the basis of (i) a nearly constant delivery rate for as
long as 10 days, (ii) possible control of the delivery rate by changing
the pH of solution, and (iii) competitive storage capacity of IBU.

3 Conclusions
On the basis of postsynthetic
modification of Zr-DASDCA and the
adsorption/delivery of IBU with Zr-DASDCAs, the following conclusions
were obtained. First, the Zr-DASDCA could be facilely modified with
OC or TC to introduce various functional groups because of large pores
and the stability of the MOF. Second, modified Zr-DASDCAs (OC-Zr-DASDCA
and TC-Zr-DASDCA) might be useful as carriers for IBU, as demonstrated
by the very stable/constant release of IBU in PBS for as long as 10
days and possible control of the release rate by changing the pH.
Third, the release rates from Zr-DASDCAs could be explained by the
pore size of the MOFs, H-bonding, and electrostatic interactions.
Finally, modification of MOFs such as stable/porous Zr-DASDCA with
OC and TC can be suggested as an effective method for the controlled
release of some drugs with carboxylic groups with slow/stable dosing
for 10 days.

saline (PBS, 0.01 M) and sodium sulfide anhydrous (Na2S)
were procured from Sigma-Aldrich. Oxalyl chloride (C2Cl2O2, 98%) and terephthaloyl chloride (C8H4Cl2O2, 98%) were acquired from
TCI Co., Ltd. Granular AC (2–3 mm, practical grade) and potassium
hydroxide (KOH, 85%) were acquired from Duksan Pure Chemical Co.,
Ltd. and Samchun Pure Chemical Co., Ltd., respectively. Ethanol (C2H6O, 99%), hydrochloric acid (HCl, 37%), methanol

Ltd. All of the chemicals were used without further purification.

4.2 Synthesis and Modification of MOFs
Prior
to the synthesis of Zr-DASDCA, a DASDCA (2,2′-diamino-4,4′-stilbenedicarboxylic
acid) linker was synthesized according to a reported procedure.27 The detailed DASDCA linker synthesis is described
in Scheme S1 in the Supporting Information.
Zr-DASDCA was synthesized via the reaction between ZrCl4 and DASDCA, conducted according to a previously reported procedure.27 Briefly, 0.07 g of ZrCl4, 0.10 g
of DASDCA linker, and 1.8 g of benzoic acid were dissolved in 20 mL
of DMF in a scintillation vial under ultrasonication. The vial was
then sealed and heated for 50 h at 120 °C to produce pale orange
crystals. The crystals were filtered and washed with DMF and methanol
and then further dried under vacuum. The modification of pristine
Zr-DASDCA was carried out using oxalyl chloride and terephthaloyl
chloride according to previously described methods49,50 to synthesize OC-Zr-DASDCA and TC-Zr-DASDCA, respectively. Oxalyl
chloride (0.15 g) or terephthaloyl chloride (0.25 g) was added separately
to a THF (10 mL) solution containing pristine Zr-DASDCA (0.20 g) for
the synthesis of OC-Zr-DASDCA and TC-Zr-DASDCA, respectively. After
2 h, TEA (0.12 g) was added dropwise to the mixture, which was then
further stirred for 12 h at room temperature. The preparation and
modification (for the case of oxalyl chloride) of Zr-DASDCA are illustrated
in Scheme 1.

4.3 Characterization of MOFs
The crystal
structures of the pristine and modified Zr-DASDCAs were analyzed using
an X-ray diffractometer (Bruker, D2 Phaser) equipped with a Cu Kα
radiation source. The textural properties of the prepared MOFs were
determined by nitrogen adsorption at −196 °C with a porosity
analyzer (TriStar II 3020, Micromeritics) after evacuation of the
MOFs overnight at 120 °C. The surface areas of the prepared MOFs
were calculated with the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET)
equation. The pore size of the studied MOFs was calculated by applying
Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) equation to the desorption
branch of nitrogen adsorption isotherms. Fourier-transform infrared
spectroscopy (FTIR) was conducted with an instrument (Jasco FTIR-4100)
fitted with an attenuated total reflectance (ATR) module (maximum
resolution: 4.0 cm–1). The results confirmed not
only the successful modification of Zr-DASDCA but also the loading
of IBU onto OC-Zr-DASDCA. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was carried
out using a PerkinElmer TGA 4000 system under nitrogen flow from 30
to 800 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C min–1 to determine the amount of IBU loaded onto the MOFs. In addition,
the successful synthesis of the DASDCA linker was confirmed from the 1H NMR spectrum obtained using an NMR spectrometer (Bruker,
AVANCE III 500, 500 MHz), as shown in Figure S1. Moreover, the acid–base titration method was utilized to
determine the free −COOH concentrations in the modified Zr-DASDCAs.

4.4 Adsorption of IBU onto Zr-DASDCAs and AC
Zr-DASDCAs or commercial AC (50 mg each) was immersed in 20 mL
of IBU solution (concentration: 5000 mg·L–1 in ethanol), and the mixture was stirred at 200 RPM using an incubated
shaker for 6–24 h at 25 °C. After adequate intervals (6,
12, 18, and 24 h), the mixture was separated using a nylon membrane
filter. After 24 h of adsorption, IBU-loaded solids were recovered
by filtration and further washing three times with ethanol and then
finally with water. The recovered solids, after 24 h of adsorption,
were used in a delivery study (see below). The remaining concentrations
of IBU in liquid solution, after each adsorption, were assessed by
measuring the absorbance of the solution at 220 nm using a UV spectrometer
(UV-1800, Shimadzu).69 Adsorption isotherms
were obtained similarly after adsorption for 24 h using solutions
with different IBU concentrations (2000–5000 mg·L–1); the adsorption results were calculated using Langmuir
isotherm.54

4.5 Release
of IBU from Zr-DASDCAs and AC
Four batches of the filtered
MOFs or AC (obtained after adsorption
for 24 h and separation) were mixed well with a spatula, dried overnight
at room temperature, and used in the delivery or release study. Moreover,
the structural integrity and textural parameters of the dried IBU-loaded
Zr-DASDCAs were checked by XRD analysis and nitrogen adsorption experiments,
respectively, to confirm the stability of the loaded MOFs and the
successful IBU uptake. The release of IBU from pristine and modified
Zr-DASDCAs and AC was performed in PBS solution. Typically, 10 mg
of dried IBU-loaded materials was dispersed into 10 mL of PBS solution
(pH 7.4, concentration of 0.01 M) at 37 °C, and the mixture was
shaken for 1–10 days, similar to the procedure used in the
adsorption study. After completion of the release experiments in the
desired time, the PBS solutions were filtered using a polytetrafluoroethylene
syringe filter (hydrophobic, 0.5 μm), and the concentration
of released IBU in the solution was examined similarly by UV spectrometry.
The effect of pH on the release of IBU from pristine and modified
Zr-DASDCAs was also studied by checking the release rates at pH 3.0,
