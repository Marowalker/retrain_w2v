Hybrid nanostructures comprised of
metal nanoparticles (MNPs) and
quantum dots (QDs) have been found to exhibit unique, new optical
properties due to the interaction that occurs between the MNPs and
QDs. The aim of this work is to understand how the exciton–plasmon
interaction in these systems is dependent on the excitation wavelength.
The nanoassemblies consisted of gold (Au) NPs coated in a silica (SiO2) shell of a controlled thickness and core/shell CdSe/CdS
QDs adsorbed onto the SiO2 shells. Our findings show that
the photoluminescence lifetimes of the hybrid constructs are dependent
on the excitation wavelength relative to the localized surface plasmon
resonance (LSPR) of the Au NPs. When the excitation wavelength is
closer to the LSPR, the photoluminescence decay of the hybrid structures
is faster. We demonstrate that by tuning the excitation wavelength
close to the resonance, there is an enhancement in the exciton–plasmon
coupling between the Au NPs and QDs resulting in a shortening in the
QD photoluminescence lifetime. We then propose a possible mechanism
to explain this excitation wavelength-dependent phenomenon.

Introduction
The coupling of metal
nanoparticles (MNPs) with colloidal quantum
dots (QDs) has led to the development of hybrid nanostructures that
are utilized in many optoelectronic applications.1−3 These heterostructures
not only possess the optical characteristics of the individual components
but also display novel features because of the exciton–plasmon
interactions in these nanosystems. Quantum dots (QDs) are nanoscale
semiconductors that display numerous advantageous properties compared
to that of organic fluorophores.4−6 In particular, QDs exhibit broad
light absorption, narrow emission and can be synthetically tuned to
different sizes depending on the application.3,4 Similar
to QDs, gold (Au) NPs can also be tailored to various sizes and possess
unique optical properties.7−9 When an Au NP is photoexcited
with light at a certain frequency, the free electrons in the Au NP
coherently oscillate, giving rise to an enhanced electric field around
the Au NP. This phenomenon is called localized surface plasmon resonance
(LSPR). Upon light absorption, bound electron-hole pairs (excitons)
are generated in QDs. When QDs neighbor MNPs, alterations in the QD
exciton dynamics ultimately impact QD emission. The photophysical
properties of such heteroassemblies depend strongly on the particle
size, shape, and distance between the single nanoconstituents, which
can either enhance or quench the QD emission in these systems.10−14 However, few groups have investigated how the excitation wavelength
of an actinic pulse impacts the plasmon-exciton coupling in an
Au/QD assembly.15,16 Understanding how the photoluminescent
properties of QDs are modified by external parameters is essential
in the creation of optoelectronic applications that depend on the
luminescent enhancement of QDs when neighboring MNPs.

There
have been a plethora of studies exploring the modifications
in the QD photoluminescence (PL) lifetimes due to the exciton–plasmon
interactions in hybrid nanosystems. A majority of these studies have
concentrated on adjusting either the spacing between the MNP and QD
or modifying the MNP size.17−21 One of the earliest works conducted by Klimov et al. investigated
variations in the QD emission after titrating with a colloidal gold
(Au) solution.17 To control the distance
between the Au NPs and QDs, the Au NPs were encapsulated in a silica
(SiO2) shell that acted as a dielectric spacer. The resulting
heteroassembly formed was that of a core@shell (Au@SiO2) structure covered in a thick layer of CdSe QDs. In addition to
utilizing SiO2 as a spacer in these systems, others have
used DNA molecules to control the distance between the MNPs and QDs.22−24 Liu et al. conjugated QDs to Au NPs with DNA strands onto a DNA
origami scaffold and tuned the distance between the QDs and NPs from
15 to 70 nm.23 Their results demonstrated
a long-range quenching in the QD emission that was attributed to additional
nonradiative decay routes when QDs were in close proximity to Au NPs.
Furthermore, studies conducted by Wu and co-workers focusing on modifying
either the MNP or QD size showed that enhanced energy transfer occurred
when there was greater spectral overlap between the localized surface
plasmon resonance (LSPR) of the Au NP and the QD emission.11,22,25

Despite the ubiquity in
distance and size-dependent studies on
metal/semiconductor nanostructures, limited work has concentrated
on how the excitation wavelength of a light source impacts the optical
properties of hybrid assemblies. Previous studies have shown a shortening
in the QD PL lifetimes when QDs were in close association to MNPs
after photoexcitation with different excitation wavelengths.15,16,25 However, a mechanism that elucidates
how exciton generation in QDs is altered by the MNP plasmons upon
tuning the excitation wavelength is still under debate. Few groups
have proposed possible mechanisms to explain this interesting phenomenon
in metal/semiconductor systems. A study conducted by Ginger et al.16 demonstrated variations in both the PL lifetimes
and quantum yields of CdSe QDs neighboring silver (Ag) nanoprisms
after photoexcitation with either a 405 or 470 nm laser pulse. They
associated their findings to the pairing of higher order plasmon modes
in the Ag nanoprisms with that of neighboring QDs. Focsan et al.25 also conducted an excitation wavelength-dependent
study in which they photoexcited hybrid samples of QDs and Au nanorods
with either a 375 or 510 nm actinic pulse. They observed a shortening
in the QD luminescent lifetime from 10.3 to 5.7 ns for the Au/QD nanostructures
when excited at 510 nm. Due to the significant spectral overlap between
that of the QD emission and LSPR of Au nanorods, they concluded that
nonradiative energy transfer via the Förster resonance energy-transfer
process was the most likely explanation for the decrease in PL lifetimes.
Furthermore, work carried out in our own group has also explored the
excitation wavelength dependence on the luminescence of hybrid Au/QD
assemblies at the single particle level.15 In our previous study, we attributed the shortening in PL decay
of a heterostructure to that of higher multiexciton emission in the
CdSe/CdS QD. This trend was most apparent when a single hybrid assembly
was excited with an excitation wavelength close to the Au extinction
and QD emission.

In this work, we demonstrate how the PL lifetimes
of Au/QD nanostructures
are dependent on the excitation wavelength relative to the LSPR of
the Au NPs in solution. CdSe/CdS QDs were attached to an Au NP that
was coated with an insulating SiO2 shell of a controlled
thickness (Au@SiO2). Photoluminescent lifetime measurements
were collected at wavelengths (510–590 nm) close to that of
the Au LSPR and QD fluorescence. From our findings, we discover that
by tuning the excitation wavelength, there exists an enhancement in
the coupling between the excitons and plasmons. These results are
apparent when examining the shortened ensemble PL lifetimes of the
heteroassemblies in solution. We postulate in the final section of
this report that photochemical and physical means contribute to the
decrease in the PL lifetimes.

Results and Discussion
Assembly of Hybrid Au@SiO2/QD System
Controlling
the coupling between QDs and Au NPs has proven to be a challenging
feat, which strongly depends on the adhesion of QDs to an Au surface.
Various synthetic methods have been utilized to bind QDs to an Au
NP surface, such as the use of covalent and electrostatic interactions
between the individual components.17,25,26 Assembly of QDs onto the Au@SiO2 NPs was
possible in our system as a result of nonspecific binding interactions
between the QDs and Au NPs, due to the mesoporous structure of the
SiO2-shell coating anchoring the poly(ethylene glycol)
methyl ether (mPEG) thiol-encapsulated QDs onto the Au surface.27,28 Although we did not employ direct binding methods of Au/QD attachment,
the self-assembly of QDs onto the Au@SiO2 NP surface resulted
in a sub-monolayer of QDs coating the Au nanostructures, as shown
in Figure 1B.

Figure 1 (A) Schematic
illustrating the synthetic design of the hybrid Au@SiO2/QD constructs. (B) Transmission electron microscope (TEM)
image of a cluster of Au@SiO2/QD assemblies (scale bar:
50 nm).

Here, we focus on an Au/QD assembly
that displays strong spectral
overlap, as shown in Figure 2. Unlike in previous works,16,17,22 the excitation wavelength is varied over the visible
range of the electromagnetic spectrum. The Au NPs chosen for this
report exhibited a plasmon peak at 620 nm, and QD emission was recorded
at 650 nm (see Figure 2), resulting in optimal spectral overlap between the Au@SiO2 NPs and QDs. The dashed lines denote the excitation wavelength used
in the time-resolved PL experiments.

Figure 2 Au@SiO2 nanostructures selected
for this study have
an absorption feature at 620 nm, which sufficiently overlaps with
that of the QD emission spectrum. The excitation wavelengths (510,
530, 550, 570, 580, and 590 nm) used in this study are shown by the
dashed lines and simultaneously photoexcited the Au LSPR and QD emission.

Time-Resolved Photoluminescence
Decays at Different Excitation
Wavelengths
Despite the stochastic binding of QDs to Au@SiO2 heterostructures, an excitation wavelength-dependent, plasmon–exciton
coupling was still evident based on our spectroscopic investigation,
as demonstrated in the figure below. Figure 3 shows the time-dependent photoluminescence
(PL) decay curves that were collected under ambient conditions at
different excitation wavelengths for CdSe/CdS QDs and the hybrid Au@SiO2/QD systems. Not surprisingly, modulations in the excitation
wavelength resulted in no observable changes for the PL decay curves
of the QD control sample. However, after mixing Au@SiO2 with a QD solution, modifications were apparent in the QD PL decay
lifetimes. In particular, at excitation wavelengths close to the Au
plasmon band and QD emission peak, a shortening in the PL decay curves
gathered at 570, 580, and 590 nm excitation wavelengths was observed.
Furthermore, we observe a similar trend at 570, 580, and 590 nm excitation
wavelengths for hybrid Au/QD assemblies consisting of 40 nm Au NP@SiO2 structures (Figure S4).

Figure 3 (A) QD photoluminescence
(PL) decay curves taken at 510–590
nm excitation wavelengths. Variations in the excitation wavelength
resulted in no noticeable changes in the PL decay curves. (B) Hybrid
Au@SiO2/QD PL decay curves acquired at 510–590 nm
excitation wavelengths. At excitation wavelengths close to the Au
LSPR band and QD emission, a shortening in the PL curve is observed
for the hybrid assemblies in solution. The insets show close-ups of
the PL decay curves.

In addition to collecting the PL decay curves for the QD
and hybrid
systems, the PL lifetimes for each series were calculated using a
biexponential fitting equation. Table 1 shows the PL lifetimes gathered for the hybrid systems
after fitting the PL decay curves for each sample. The additional
fitting parameters (Table S2) and QD PL
lifetimes (Table S1) can be found in the
Supporting Information. Compared to the PL lifetimes of the QD samples,
shorter PL lifetimes were obtained for the hybrid assemblies at each
excitation wavelength. This trend was most noticeable in the shorter
lifetime-component (τ1) values of the Au/QD systems,
in which there was a drop in the QD PL lifetime (Table S1) from ∼10 to ∼5 ns (Table 1). Overall, the fitted lifetime
results are, not surprisingly, indicative of a nonradiative energy
transfer between the Au and QD, as detailed previously in the literature.19,22Table 1 shows a drop
in both the short (τ1) and long lifetime (τ2) components as the excitation wavelength approaches the Au
NP plasmon and QD emission (Figure 2). Apart from the 550 nm excitation wavelength, a 2.7
ns difference for τ1 was observed from 510 to 590
nm, whereas a 7.0 ns change was apparent from 510 to 590 nm for τ2. Hence, the most significant variation in the PL lifetime
was found when the hybrid system was excited with a 590 nm wavelength.
Compared to the QD excitation at 590 nm, there was a 5.1 ns difference
for τ1 between the hybrid and QD systems (Table S1), whereas the τ2 change
was 4.1 ns between the two systems. The shortening in the PL lifetimes
and time-resolved PL decays shows that energy transfer is still possible
between the QD aggregates and Au NPs and that the pairing is significantly
impacted by excitation wavelengths close to the Au plasmon and QD
emission.

Our results demonstrate that at excitation wavelengths shorter
than that of the plasmon resonance of Au NPs (i.e., 510, 530 nm),
there is a ∼5 ns difference in the hybrid QD emission lifetime
when compared to that of the isolated QDs (Table S1). When the excitation wavelength was close to that of the
Au NP plasmon frequency at 620 nm (i.e., 580, 590 nm), however, even
shorter QD lifetimes were observed (Table 1). Although further work is needed to improve
upon the experimental design of the hybrid Au/QD system, our findings
illustrate promising results that the excitation wavelength influences
the interaction of plasmons and excitons. In the final section, we
postulate a mechanism to explain the wavelength-dependent phenomenon
of plasmon–exciton coupling in the hybrid Au@SiO2/QD system.

Proposed Mechanism behind Plasmon–Exciton
Coupling in
Hybrid Au/QD System
As addressed earlier in this report,
other studies have focused on exploring how either size or the distance
between an Au NP and a QD influences the plexitonic coupling in the
hybrid system.10,14,23 However, few have investigated how tuning the excitation wavelength
of a laser pulse impacts the pairing of plasmons and excitons. Moreover,
a mechanism that delineates the impact of excitation wavelength on
the photoluminescence (PL) decay of hybrid metal/semiconductor systems
is still under scrutiny.15,16,25 Here, we offer our mechanistic understanding of how plasmon–exciton
coupling is affected by tuning the excitation wavelength at the ensemble
level. In our previous work on excitation wavelength dependence for
a single particle system, we concluded that the shortening in the
QD PL decay was related to higher multiexciton emission.15 As the excitation wavelength approaches that
of the Au NP plasmon band, yet shorter than the cut-off wavelength
of the QD absorption, we suggest that an enhanced absorption of QD
near the Au LSPR occurs. Consequently, the multiexciton population
in the QDs increases even though the excitation power is kept low.
The multiexcitons are known to have much shorter lifetimes than single
excitons due to the fast Auger recombination in the QDs,29,30 and the multiexciton population depends on the photon absorption.
When the excitation wavelength is closer to the Au LSPR, the absorption
of the QDs is enhanced to a greater extent compared to the case when
the excitation pulse is away from the LSPR. Therefore, an “enhanced”
multiexciton emission would contribute to the measured photoluminescence
at 590 nm excitation than at 510 nm. Thus, a higher multiexciton contribution
makes the PL decay of the Au/QD system faster at 590 nm, and these
findings are consistent to what we have observed earlier at the single
particle level.15

Additional plasmonic
effects on the QD photoluminescence include a combination of energy
transfer (via Förster resonance energy transfer or surface
energy transfer), the Purcell effect, and light scattering from the
Au NPs.22,31 Due to the relatively large size of the
Au NP cores (∼120 nm), light scattering dominates over the
Purcell effect.31 Thus, modulation of the
excitation wavelength close to the Au LSPR peak (∼580–590
nm) results in excitation of the LSPR peak inducing a strong dipole
coupling between that of the Au NPs and QDs. This strong coupling
could increase the rate of nonradiative energy transfer.32 In addition to energy transfer, photoexcitation
of isolated QDs leads to radiative and nonradiative decay channels
intrinsic to the QD, which include nonradiative decay pathways, such
as surface trap states of varying energy levels, as reported in the
literature.33−35 An energetic barrier needs to be overcome by the
electron after photoexcitation to access the higher energy, nonemissive
trap states. By tuning the excitation wavelength close to the Au LSPR,
the electron has the energy gained from the plasmon and could enter
these nonradiative channels. This additional energy could allow the
QDs to access higher energy nonemissive trap states. Finally, since
the PL lifetime (τ) is dependent on both the radiative (kr) and nonradiative (knr) decay rates (), the access to higher, nonemissive trap
states results in an increase in knr and
thus a decrease in the PL lifetime (τ) of the QD.

Finally,
multiple studies have reported how the synthetic motif
of heterostructures strongly influences the optical properties of
a hybrid system.36,37 Hence, the structural design
of our Au@SiO2/QD assemblies may also explain the differences
in the PL decay curves and lifetimes. QD aggregation, concomitant
with different QD sizes, resulted in sample inhomogeneity as evidenced
by the TEM images in Figures 1B and S7. The inhomogeneous nature
of the Au/QD system could lead to subsets of Au/QD pairs in solution
dominating the emission when the sample is excited at different excitation
wavelengths. The intermittent excitation of the hybrid Au/QD assemblies
in solution may contribute to the observed variations in the PL decays
and lifetimes when the excitation wavelength is tuned. Thus, future
work is needed to revise the experimental conditions to obtain more
uniform, hybrid systems in solution. By improving the synthetic design
of our hybrid assembly, we aim to develop a system in which we can
systematically adjust the PL lifetime through tuning the excitation
wavelength.

Conclusions
Hybrid metal/semiconductor
structures are versatile systems that
can be influenced by numerous factors. In this study, variations in
the PL decay curves were acquired for a hybrid Au@SiO2/QD
system in solution when the excitation wavelength of a laser source
was tuned. Most notably, a shortening in the PL lifetimes was recorded
when the excitation wavelength was on resonance with the Au LSPR (∼620
nm), specifically at 580 or 590 nm. We attributed the shortening of
the QD lifetime to increase multiexciton emission due to enhanced
photon absorption of QDs at plasmon resonance, and access to additional
nonradiative channels from plasmon-induced resonance energy transfer
in the system. Further efforts are underway to design nanostructures
that have a uniform, sub-monolayer of QDs coating the Au NPs. Nevertheless,
our system contributes an additional discussion to the disputable
mechanism, and we hope this report provides a foundation for both
application and fundamental studies.

Synthesis of Au@SiO2 NP Assemblies
Au@SiO2 NP structures were
synthesized in accordance with a multistep
procedure that demonstrated a controlled silica shell growth.38 First, 120 nm Au NPs were synthesized from 40
nm Au NPs following a seed-mediated protocol.38−40 Prior to silica
shell deposition onto the 120 nm sized Au NP surfaces, the primer
(3-aminopropyl)triethoxysilane (APTES) was added drop-wise to the
Au solution to activate the surfaces of the NPs. The mixture was stirred
for 15 min at room temperature before the addition of a sodium silicate
solution. The Au NP solution was submerged in a hot water bath and
mixed for 1 h. After 1 h, the Au NPs were removed from the hot water
bath and cooled to room temperature. The Au@SiO2 NP structures
were centrifuged twice for 10 min and redispersed in deionized water
each time. The resultant Au@SiO2 nanostructures consisted
of a silica shell that was initially 5 nm thick. To achieve a 20 nm
thick SiO2 shell around the NPs, the Au@SiO2 NP assemblies (∼5 nm thick) were added to a mixture of 2-propanol,
deionized water, and ammonium hydroxide, which was then stirred at
room temperature. Finally, a solution of tetraethyl orthosilicate
(TEOS) was injected drop-wise into the solution, and the solution
was left to stir overnight at room temperature. The SiO2-coated Au colloids were centrifuged twice in 2-propanol and redispersed
in ethanol.

Aqueous Phase Transfer of CdSe/CdS Quantum
Dots
CdSe/CdS
(core/shell) quantum dots were synthesized following procedures reported
in the literature.41,42 An aqueous phase transfer of
the CdSe/CdS QDs was performed by using an exchange protocol detailed
by Chen et al.42 The synthesis first required
the thiol-terminated poly(ethylene glycol) methyl ether thiol (mPEG
thiol) to be dissolved in chloroform. Next, 2 mL of the CdSe/CdS QD
solution (2.5 mg/mL) was added drop-wise to the mPEG thiol solution
while stirring. The flask was degassed with nitrogen for 5 min and
left to stir overnight. Excess surfactants were removed by dispersing
the QDs in ethanol and centrifuging for 20 min. The final QD products
were redispersed in deionized water.

Preparation of Hybrid Au@SiO2/QD Assemblies
The hybrid Au/QD structures were prepared
by adding 200 μL
of the mPEG thiol-coated QDs to a solution of Au@SiO2 nanostructures.
The solution was stirred overnight under ambient conditions to facilitate
the self-assembly of the QDs onto the SiO2 shells. To remove
any unabsorbed QDs, the Au/QD constructs were purified via centrifugation
and finally redispersed in deionized water following a similar protocol
established by Klimov et al.17

Characterization
of Hybrid Au@SiO2/QD Assemblies
During each step
of the heterostructure preparation, the extinction
and emission spectra were collected with a Cary 60 (Agilent) UV–visible
spectrophotometer and a Fluoromax spectrofluorometer (Horiba Scientific),
respectively. To determine the SiO2 shell thickness around
the Au NPs and the binding of QDs to the Au NPs, low-resolution TEM
images were gathered with a JEOL 2010 microscope that had an accelerating
voltage of 200 kV. Additionally, high-resolution TEM images of the
samples were acquired with a FEI-Talos microscope set to an accelerating
voltage of 200 kV. The TEM images can be found in the Supporting Information.

Time-Resolved Photoluminescence
Measurements
To obtain
the PL decays of the QD or Au/QD solution, a supercontinuum pulsed
laser (Solea, PicoQuant, ∼100–120 ps pulse duration,
2.5 MHz repetition rate) was used to photoexcite each sample at either
510, 530, 550, 570, 580, or 590 nm excitation wavelength. The photoluminescence
of the solutions was acquired through a 20× air objective (Nikon,
N.A. = 0.45) and focused onto a single-photon detector (τ-SPAD,
PicoQuant) that was equipped with the appropriate spectral filter.
The photoluminescence decays were gathered using a time-dependent
single-photon counting module (PicoHarp 300, PicoQuant) with a time
resolution of 32 ps. All experiments were performed under ambient
conditions.
