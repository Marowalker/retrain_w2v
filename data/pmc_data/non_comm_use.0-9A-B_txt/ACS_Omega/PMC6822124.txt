The recalcitrant
biofilm formed by fungus Cryptococcus neoformans is a life-threatening pathogenic condition responsible for further
intensifying cryptococcosis. Considering the enhanced biofilm resistance
and toxicity of synthetic antifungal drugs, the search for efficient,
nontoxic, and cost-effective natural therapeutics has received a major
boost. Phenolic (thymol and carvacrol) and aldehydic (citral) terpenes
are natural and safe alternatives capable of efficient microbial biofilm
inhibition. However, the biofilm inhibition mechanism of these terpenes
still remains unclear. In this study, we adopted an integrative biophysical
and biochemical approach to elucidate the hierarchy of their action
against C. neoformans biofilm cells.
The microscopic analysis revealed disruption of the biofilm cell surface
with elevation in surface roughness and reduction in cell height.
Although all terpenes acted through ergosterol biosynthesis inhibition,
the phenolic terpenes also selectively interacted via ergosterol binding.
Further, the alterations in the fatty acid profile in response to
terpenes attenuated the cell membrane fluidity with enhanced permeability,
resulting in pore formation and efflux of the K+/intracellular
content. Additionally, mitochondrial depolarization caused higher
levels of reactive oxygen species, which led to increased lipid peroxidation
and activation of the antioxidant defense system. Indeed, the oxidative
stress caused a significant decline in the amount of extracellular
polymeric matrix and capsule sugars (mannose, xylose, and glucuronic
acid), leading to a reduced capsule size and an overall negative charge
on the cell surface. This comprehensive data revealed the mechanistic
insights into the mode of action of terpenes on biofilm inhibition,
which could be exploited for formulating novel anti-biofilm agents.

1 Introduction
Cryptococcosis
is a multifaceted and potentially fatal systemic fungal infection
entailing a global burden of ∼223 000 clinical cases
with ∼181 100 losses inclusive of 15% AIDS-related deaths
per annum.1Cryptococcus
neoformans, an encapsulated yeast, is the causative
agent of this systemic infection affecting lungs, skin, and the central
nervous system (CNS).2 The most acute manifestation
of cryptococcal infection is meningoencephalitis, which is further
challenged due to the colonization of C. neoformans inside the CNS to form biofilm-like cryptococcomas.3 Moreover, the increased use of ventricular shunts for intracranial
hypertension management has been associated with adherence of C. neoformans on these medical devices.4,5 This highlights the significance of C. neoformans biofilm as a critical pathogenic condition. The biofilm is a well-structured
phenotype of sessile cryptococcal cells embedded within a self-produced
polysaccharide-rich extracellular polymeric matrix (EPM) attached
to the surface.3 The EPM provides mechanical
stability and strong cell–cell communication and serves as
a nutrient source for the biofilms.6 It
is further responsible for the recalcitrant and invasive nature of
the biofilms.3 The pathogenesis and biofilm-forming
ability of C. neoformans is attributed
to a key constituent of its polysaccharide capsule, glucuronoxylomannan
(GXM).7 The capsule of this fungal pathogen
is a vital component for its survival inside the host immune system.8 The capsular GXM aggregation forms the major
part of EPM in the biofilm and is responsible for its resistance against
standard antifungals.7

Currently,
the treatment strategy for cryptococcosis comprises three main categories
of antifungal agents including polyenes (amphotericin B, AMB; nystatin,
NYS), azoles (fluconazole, FLC), and pyrimidine analogue (flucytosine,
5-FC).9 However, the efficacy of these
drugs against C. neoformans biofilms
is limited. Though the biofilm forms are susceptible to AMB and its
lipid formulations, the effective concentrations exceed the therapeutic
range (0.025–2 μg/mL), leading to severe nephrotoxicity
and emergence of drug resistance in clinical strains.10 Cryptococcal biofilm is highly tolerant to azole group
antimycotics and cannot inhibit biofilm formation as these drugs are
unable to prevent GXM release, a crucial step in yeast adhesion and
subsequent biofilm formation.11 Contrary
to this, Candida albicans biofilms
are resistant to FLC owing to the presence of β-1,3-glucan,
a basic component of its EPM. β-1,3-Glucan acts as a drug sponge
by sequestering FLC and thereby preventing it from reaching the biofilm
cell target.12 Thus, the incompetency of
these standard antifungal drugs in effectively curing biofilm-associated
infections necessitates for the next stage of treatment, which is
often restricted to device replacement. This incurs not only heavy
cost and pain due to surgical procedure but also is further challenged
by the development of resistance.13

Therefore, the present scenario has urged an imperative need to develop
alternative natural drug therapies that are not only effective against C. neoformans biofilms but also safe and cost-effective.
In this regard, essential oils and its active components (EO-ACs)
are one of the potential drug therapies which are produced as secondary
metabolites by the aromatic plants. These are complex and volatile
compounds with well-established antimicrobial and antibiofilm potential
against different pathogens.14,15 Among the EO-ACs, thymol
(THY), carvacrol (CARV), and citral (CIT) have been extensively reported
to strongly inhibit biofilms of pathogenic bacteria including carbapenemase-producing
Gram-negative bacilli, uropathogenic Escherichia coli, and fungilike C. albicans and Cryptococcus spp (Figure 1).16,17 Both THY and CARV are
phenolic terpenes obtained from Thymus vulgaris and Origanum vulgare, whereas CIT
is an aldehydic terpene extracted from Cymbopogon citratus. A few studies have explored the plausible mode of action of THY,
CARV, and CIT against planktonic form of various microorganisms including Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas
aeruginosa, Cronobacter sakazakii, Mycobacterium avium, Candida sp., Aspergillus flavus, and so forth.18,19 However, till date, no detailed
reports are available on the mechanism of biofilm inhibition/eradication.

In a recent study, our group analyzed the anti-biofilm
activity of THY, CARV, and CIT against C. neoformans and their nontoxicity toward human cell lines.17 In order to comprehend their mode of action against the
biofilm, holistic insight into the phenotypic and physiological alterations
is quintessential. Hence, the present study focuses on delineating
the biofilm inhibition mechanism of the terpenes (THY, CARV, and CIT)
by analyzing the morphological changes and qualitative/quantitative
alterations in the EPM and cellular components of C.
neoformans biofilm cells.

2 Results
2.1 Assessing the Changes in the Surface Topography of C. neoformans Biofilm Cells
The surface
topographical analysis of the cell’s outer surface is a noteworthy
indicator of its health state. The surface topography of biofilm cells
treated at 0.5× or 1/2 BIC80 of THY (16 μg/mL),
CARV (32 μg/mL), and CIT (64 μg/mL) (Table S1 in the Supporting Information) was visualized on both
micro and nanoscale levels using field emission scanning electron
microscopy (FE-SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM), respectively.
The FE-SEM/AFM micrographs of the control (CK) biofilm cells showed
a spherical and turgid cellular morphology with a smooth and uniform
topography throughout the surface (Figure 2A, panels I, II). In contrast, the terpene(s)-treated
biofilm cells indicated severe damage and shrunken morphology with
aberration on the cellular surface resulting in pores along with the
rupturing of the cells (Figure 2A, panels I, II). These results are in correlation with the
alterations reported in the C. albicans biofilm cells after treatment with C. citratus EOs.20

and CIT (64 μg/mL) for 6 h. Results represent average ±
SD (n = 3) and *p < 0.05, **p < 0.001 when compared with CK.

Additionally, to get quantitative insights into changes in surface
topography, three-dimensional based high spatial resolution AFM analysis
was performed. The CK biofilm cells appeared normal in morphology
with a smooth outer surface. On the contrary, THY- and CAR- treated
cells exhibited collapsed margins with a convoluted and bumpy surface,
and CIT-treated cell surfaces were relatively less damaged with the
presence of a few septa (Figure 2A, panel III). The above visual morphological alterations
were also supported by significant variations in the biophysical properties,
particularly surface roughness and cell height of C.
neoformans (Figure 2B,C). The biofilm cells treated with THY (∼918
nm), CAR (∼1005 nm), and CIT (∼1186 nm) showed a significant
reduction in cell height in comparison to CK (∼1588 nm), as
shown in Figure 2B.
Furthermore, the root–mean-square of surface roughness remarkably
increased in treated biofilm cells because of membrane shrinkage caused
by the terpenes (Figure 2C).

2.2 Determining the Qualitative and Quantitative
Changes in the EPM
Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy
(FT-IR) provides a first line of evidence regarding the compositional
analysis of biomolecules present in a given sample. The FT-IR spectra
of CK and terpene-treated biofilm EPM showed the presence of polysaccharides
(1300–900 cm–1) and proteins (1700–1500
cm–1).21 The most remarkable
spectral differences between CK and treated EPM was noticed in the
range of 900–1200 cm–1, representing the
variable interactions at carbonyl (C=O) moieties present in
the polysaccharides. The peak at 982 cm–1 in CK
shifted to 1021 cm–1 in the case of CIT, suggesting
its interaction with C–O–C and C–O–P rings
present in the polysaccharides. On the other hand, the above peak
completely disappeared in THY- and CARV-treated EPM (Figure 3A). Further, the absorption
peaks at 1569 cm–1 in CK EPM shifted to 1579 cm–1 (THY), 1580 cm–1 (CARV), and 1583
cm–1 (CIT), indicating a stronger interaction of
the above terpenes with N–H and C–N in the peptide backbone
of the amide II region (Figure 3A). The peak intensities for polysaccharides and proteins
were observed to be higher in CK EPM as compared to terpene-treated
samples (Figure 3A).
The above results were corroborated by performing the quantitative
analysis. The EPM of CK samples accounted for ∼90% of total
carbohydrate with only ∼5% total protein (Figures 3B and S1). On the other hand, the terpene-treated samples showed
a significant reduction (35–45%) in total carbohydrates, whereas
no noticeable changes were recorded in the total protein content (Figures 3B and S1).

μg/mL, CARV-32 μg/mL, and CIT-64 μg/mL) for 6 h.
Values are represented as mole % of total carbohydrate in EPM. The
data represents average ± SD (n = 3) and *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01 when compared
with CK.

2.2.1 Evaluating the Alterations
in the Glycosyl Composition of EPM
The changes in the carbohydrate
glycosyl composition were determined by calculating the mole % amount
of individual glycosyl residues in the EPM. The carbohydrates in the
EPM of CK biofilm majorly comprised of glucose, xylose, and mannose
amounting to ∼64% of the total carbohydrate, while rhamnose,
galactose, glucuronic acid, ribose, and fucose formed the rest (∼36%)
(Figure 3C). The carbohydrate
content in terpene-treated EPM showed variation in the amount of glycosyl
residues (Figure 3C).
All terpene-treated EPM displayed a significant reduction in glucuronic
acid, mannose, and rhamnose contents; however, the decrease in the
content of sugars such as glucose and xylose were differential in
the terpene-treated samples. Interestingly, the amount of galactose,
fucose, and ribose significantly increased in all treated EPMs, suggesting
perturbation in the matrix structure of the treated biofilm (Figure 3C).

2.3 Determining the Qualitative and Quantitative Changes in the
Cellular Macromolecules
FT-IR spectroscopy was conducted
to identify the changes in the principal biological components of
the biofilm cells after respective terpene treatment. To elucidate
the changes in the biomolecular composition, FT-IR spectra has been
divided into five regions: lipids (3000–2800 cm–1), proteins/amides I, II (1700–1500 cm–1), phospholipids/nucleic acids (1500–1200 cm–1), polysaccharides (1200–900 cm–1), and
the fingerprint region (900–600 cm–1).21 The spectra region between 1700–1500,
1500–1200, 900 and 1200 cm–1 exhibited no
distinctive variations in spectral properties, indicating that terpenes
did not affect the proteins, DNA/RNA, and polysaccharides in the biofilm
cells (Figure 4A, black
dotted rectangles). The biochemical assay results on these biomolecules
also evidenced no significant change, thus substantiating the infrared
spectroscopy results (Figures S2 and S3). The most striking difference was observed in the spectral range
of 3000 and 2800 cm–1, signifying that membrane
fatty acids were majorly affected by terpene treatment (Figure 4A, black dotted oval). The
reduced peak intensity at 2923 cm–1 which conform
to the asymmetric νas (CH2) stretching
in fatty acids was observed in the treated cells, suggesting molecular
interaction of the terpenes with fatty acids and in-turn reduced membrane
fluidity. Further, a peak at 2857 cm–1 attributed
to symmetric νs (CH2) stretching of >CH2 functional groups in fatty acids completely disappeared under
treatment conditions, indicating structural changes.22 The FT-IR results were further supported by a quantitative
analysis which showed remarkable differences in the lipid content
of terpene-treated biofilm cells as compared to CK (Figure 4B). The lipid content in THY-,
CARV-, and CIT-treated biofilm cells were reduced by ∼52, ∼50,
and ∼41%, respectively (Figure 4B).

μg/mL, CARV-32 μg/mL, and CIT-64 μg/mL) for 6 h.
The data represents average ± SD (n = 3) and
*p < 0.05 when compared with CK.

2.3.1 Analyzing the Fatty Acid Profile Changes
The fatty acid compositional analysis can potentially shed light
on how the constituents of fatty acids modulate the permeability and
fluidity of the cell membranes under differential stress conditions.23 To delineate such changes, the fatty acid composition
of C. neoformans biofilm cells without
treatment (CK) and with THY (8, 16, 32 μg/mL), CAR (16, 32,
64 μg/mL), and CIT (32, 64, 128 μg/mL) treatments at 0.25×
or 1/4 BIC80, 0.5× or 1/2 BIC80, and 1×
BIC80, respectively, were determined (Figure 4C and Table S2). The major composition of the fatty acids in C. neoformans includes palmitic acid (C16:0), hexadecanoic
acid (C17:0), stearic acid (C18:0), oleic acid (C18:1), and linoleic
acid (C18:2). After 6 h incubation with the terpenes, no significant
changes were observed at 0.25× or 1/4 BIC80, while
moderate changes were noted at 0.5× or 1/2 BIC80,
and the most prominent changes in the fatty acid profile were observed
at 1× BIC80 (Figure 4C). Among the saturated fatty acids (SFAs), the relative
quantity of palmitic acid increased from ∼26% (CK) to ∼43%
(THY), ∼41% (CARV), and ∼39% (CIT), respectively, at
1× BIC80 treatment with p < 0.01.
However, the amount of hexadecanoic acid augmented from ∼2.9
to ∼4.2% in the case of THY, whereas CARV and CIT treatments
resulted in ∼1.2 and ∼2.7% reduction, respectively (Figure 4C). Additionally,
the relative amount of stearic acid increased by more than 2-fold
from ∼6.3% (CK) to ∼14.1% (THY), ∼16.5% (CARV),
and ∼13.2% (CIT). Among the terpenes, THY caused maximum increase
in the proportions of SFAs, followed by CARV and CIT (Table S2). In the case of unsaturated fatty acids
(UFAs), particularly, the oleic acid content decreased to ∼2.4,
∼7.8, and ∼12.3% in THY, CARV, and CIT, respectively,
in comparison to CK (∼36.65%) at 1× BIC80 treatment.
However, the relative amount of linoleic acid was enhanced from ∼27.7
to ∼35.59% (THY), ∼33.06% (CARV), and ∼30.41%
(CIT) as depicted in Figure 4C. Such changes in the individual fatty acid constituents
resulted in a significant reduction of UFA/SFA ratio from 1.81 to
0.64, 0.69, and 0.75 at BIC80 treatment of THY, CAR, and
CIT, respectively, which could essentially influence the cell fluidity.
It is clear from the results that the terpenes caused an adverse effect
on the total lipid profile of C. neoformans biofilm cells.

2.4 Evaluating the Effect of
Terpenes on the Cell Wall and Capsule
The presence of a capsule
on the cell wall is one of the unique features of C.
neoformans. Hence, the effect of the terpenes on cell
wall binding and different capsule features such as size and surface
charge was analyzed.

2.4.1 Sorbitol Assay
Sorbitol assay evaluates the role of the cell wall in the antifungal
mechanism of terpenes. Sorbitol is an osmoprotectant that stabilizes
the cell wall under stress. In general, an increase in MIC80/BIC80 will be observed in the sorbitol presence if the
mode of action of the drug is through direct attachment to the cell
wall. The MIC80 and BIC80 values for the terpenes
against C. neoformans did not alter
in the presence of osmotic protector sorbitol, indicating that the
antifungal action of THY, CARV, and CIT did not affect the cell wall
integrity directly (Table 1). In line with the literature, the MIC80 (32 μg/mL)
and BIC80 (128 μg/mL) values for the cell wall acting
drug (CASP) increased to 4-fold and 8-fold, respectively, in the presence
of sorbitol.

a BIC80# was determined by measuring

2.4.2 Assessing the Changes in the Capsule Size and Surface Charge
In order to assess the action of terpenes on capsule properties,
the changes in the capsule size and surface charge were analyzed.
Indian ink-stained capsule images of terpene-treated C. neoformans biofilm cells indicated a reduction
in size as compared to CK (Figure 5A). The capsule size of THY (1.33 μm)-, CARV
(1.56 μm)-, and CIT (1.95 μm)-treated biofilm cells significantly
decreased by 49%, 40%, and 25%, respectively, in comparison to CK
(2.58 μm) (Figure 5B). Further, in the presence of 0.5× or 1/2 BIC80 of phenolic/aldehydic terpenes, a significant decline in the surface
negativity of biofilm cells was observed. The surface negativity reduction
was maximum in the case of THY (−2.5 z/mV)
followed by CARV (−3.6 z/mV) and CIT (−5.6 z/mV) as shown in Figure 5C.

μg/mL, and CIT-64 μg/mL) for 6 h. The data represents
the average ± SD (n = 3) and *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, and ***p < 0.001 when compared with CK.

2.5 Analyzing the Changes in Membrane Permeability
and Integrity
2.5.1 Ergosterol Binding and
Quantification Assay
Ergosterol is unique to fungi and has
multifacet roles involving the maintenance of membrane fluidity, integrity,
and proper functioning of membrane-bound enzymes.24 Ergosterol-binding assay was performed to investigate the
possible action of phenolic/aldehydic terpenes (THY, CARV, and CIT)
on the fungal cell membrane and their ability to form complexes with
ergosterol. The results revealed a 2–8 fold increase in the
MIC80 values and a 4–16 fold increase in the BIC80 values of THY and CARV in the presence of 100–400
μg/mL of ergosterol, thus suggesting the action of above terpenes
through membrane ergosterol binding, as evident by comparison with
positive control drugs (AMB, NYS). However, the MIC80 and
BIC80 values of CIT did not alter, suggesting that this
aldehydic terpene does not bind to ergosterol directly (Table 2).

a BIC80# was determined by measuring XTT reduction
activity.

To explore the
effect of the above terpenes on the ergosterol biosynthesis level,
the amount of ergosterol in biofilm cells was determined at three
different concentrations (0.25× or 1/4 BIC80, 0.5×
or 1/2 BIC80, and 1× BIC80). The phenolic/aldehydic
terpenes displayed a significant modulation of ergosterol content
in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 6A). Among the terpenes, the aldehydic terpene CIT (64
μg/mL) at 1× BIC80 exhibited the maximum reduction
in ergosterol content, which was comparable to the positive control
drug (FLC), a well-known inhibitor of ergosterol biosynthesis, suggesting
that it acted by disrupting the ergosterol biosynthetic pathway (Figure 6A). On the other
hand, reduction in the ergosterol content by phenolic terpenes THY
(16 μg/mL) and CARV (32 μg/mL) at their respective 1×
BIC80 was comparatively less (Figure 6A).

content release; (D) protein release; (E) fluorescence intensity of
PI; and (F) fluorescence micrographs of PI-stained cells before (control;
CK) and after phenolic/aldehydic terpene treatment at 1/2 BIC80 (THY-16 μg/mL, CARV-32 μg/mL, and CIT-64 μg/mL).
The ergosterol content in the untreated CK (control) was considered
100%. Positive control: FLC and AMB. The data represents the average
± SD (n = 3) and **p < 0.01,
***p < 0.001 when compared with CK.

2.5.2 Extracellular Potassium Leakage Assay
The potassium (K+) ion leakage from the cell to the
outside environment is an indicator of disorganization of membrane
permeability and integrity. To ascertain the action of phenolic/aldehydic
terpenes on the biofilm cell membrane, the amount of K+ ion leakage was evaluated. All three terpenes displayed a time-dependent
rise in K+ ion leakage in comparison to control (CK). Among
the terpenes, THY induced the maximum K+ ion leakage, closely
followed by CARV (Figure 6B). Although the treatment with the aldehydic terpene CIT
significantly increased the K+ ion leakage, the amount
of K+ ions leaked was lower in comparison to both the phenolic
terpenes (Figure 6B).

2.5.3 Intracellular Content and Protein Release
To study the mechanism of phenolic/aldehydic terpenes acting at the
level of membrane permeability, the release of intracellular content
(DNA/RNA/nucleotides) and protein from the biofilm cells was assessed
(Figure 6C,D). A consistent
rise in the intracellular content and protein release with time was
observed in THY-, CARV-, and CIT-treated biofilm cells. The phenolic/aldehydic
terpenes initiated the damage of fungal membrane within 2 h of exposure
causing cytoplasmic leakage. At the 8 h time point, THY and CARV were
equally effective, followed by CIT (Figure 6C). The proteins released into the supernatant
were also found to be in line with the release of intracellular content
(Figure 6D), indicating
that prolonged exposure to the terpenes resulted in a severe membrane
impairment.

2.5.4 Plasma Membrane Integrity
Assay
The membrane damaging effects of phenolic/aldehydic
terpenes were confirmed by the propidium iodide (PI) assay. PI is
a DNA intercalating fluorescent dye employed to examine the action
of drugs on the cell membranes. The maximum fluorescence of internalized
PI was observed in THY, followed by CARV and then CIT, suggesting
its strong potency against biofilm cells by causing membrane lesions,
which further leads to loss of cell viability. It is worth noting
that the membrane-damaging potential of phenolic terpenes is comparable
to that of commercial drug AMB (Figure 6F). The above results were also supported by PI-stained
fluorescence microscopic images, which exhibited enhanced red fluorescence
of dead/damaged biofilm cells on terpene exposure (Figure 6E).

2.6 Evaluating the Oxidative Stress and Antioxidant Defense System
Responses
2.6.1 Assessment of the Mitochondrial Membrane
Potential
Mitochondrion is the main organelle involved in
the reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and plays a key role
in oxidative stress-induced cell death.25 The terpene treatment caused mitochondrial depolarization by significantly
reducing the mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) in comparison to CK (Figure 7B). The relative fluorescence intensity reduced to
∼42, ∼61, and ∼57% in the case of THY-, CARV-
and CIT-treated biofilm cells (Figure 7B). The rhodamine 123 (Rho123)-stained fluorescent
images of biofilm cells further verified that the terpenes caused
loss of ΔΨm (Figure 7A).

and CIT-64 μg/mL) for 6 h. The data represents the average ±
SD (n = 3) and *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01 when compared with CK.

2.6.2 ROS Quantification and Lipid Peroxidation
The phenolic/aldehydic terpenes are known to trigger the generation
of ROS, which results in lipid peroxidation. The intracellular ROS
levels in the terpene-treated biofilm cells was monitored by employing
a specific fluorogenic probe H2DCFDA (Figure 8A). A substantial enhancement
in the fluorescence intensity was detected in the biofilm incubated
with terpenes, suggesting the accumulation of ROS (Figure 8A). The enhanced ROS production
in the terpene-treated cells was also evident from the fluorescence
images that exhibited enhanced green fluorescence (Figure 8B).

stress and related antioxidant enzymes activity: (A) amount of ROS;

and after phenolic/aldehydic terpene treatment at 1/2 BIC80 (THY-16 μg/mL, CARV-32 μg/mL, and CIT-64 μg/mL)
for 6 h. Positive control: HP. The data represents the average ±
SD (n = 3) and *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, and ***p < 0.001 when compared
with CK.

The oxidative damage caused to
membrane lipids can be estimated using lipid peroxidation byproducts,
thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS). In comparison to
CK, the TBARS content remarkably increased by ∼5.4, ∼3.8,
∼3.3, and ∼2.7-folds in hydrogen peroxide (HP)-, THY-,
CARV-, and CIT-treated biofilms, respectively, suggesting membrane
damage (Figure 8C).

2.6.3 Superoxide Dismutase, Catalase, and Peroxidase
Activities
The protective response of C. neoformans biofilm cells to the elevated levels of free radicals/ROS was determined
by assessing the modulation in the activities of the antioxidant enzymes
such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and peroxidase
(POD). All three terpenes (THY, CARV, and CIT) instigated an elevation
of ∼1.6–2.3-fold in the activities of SOD and POD as
compared to the CK biofilm (Figure 8D,F). A profound upsurge in the SOD and POD activities
of biofilm cells in response to terpenes suggested accumulation of
superoxide and peroxide species. However, the terpene-treated biofilm
cells did not show any significant change in the CAT activity (Figure 8E).

3 Discussion
The multifactorial defense mechanism of
cryptococcal biofilms confers resistance to standard antifungal treatment
and is responsible for causing morbidity/mortality due to recalcitrant
human infections. These mechanisms include EPM, high cell density,
upregulation of efflux pumps, and persister cell population.26 The binding and sequestration of drugs by EPM
of biofilms seems to be the most universal mechanism of resistance
against the standard antifungals.27 Additionally,
the large size of synthetic drugs hinders in diffusion and penetration
into the matrix of the biofilm.28 This
ultimately leads to the trapping of drugs in the carbohydrate-rich
EPM turning drugs ineffective against the biofilms.29 Thus, the current situation has put a tremendous liability
on the scientific community to search and develop novel alternative
agents that are small, amphipathic, and nontoxic to efficiently combat
cryptococcal biofilms by diffusing/penetrating through EPM. In this
regard, previous reports have established natural phenolic (THY and
CARV) and aldehydic (CIT) terpenes as potential candidates against
biofilms.15−17 Recently, we reported the nontoxic behavior of these
phenolic/aldehydic terpenes at their respective BIC80 falling
into a safe dosage range without causing substantial toxicity against
human keratinocytes and renal cells.17 The
phenolic terpenes THY/CARV caused ∼8–11% loss in viability
of keratinocytes at 32 μg/mL. On the other hand, CIT at the
similar dose affected ∼22% keratinocytes, suggesting the less
toxic attribute of phenolic terpenes in comparison to aldehydic terpenes.
Indeed, the coculture infection model further revealed the selective
action of phenolic terpenes against cryptococcal cells without affecting
keratinocytes. In line with these results, Elshafie et al. demonstrated
the high toxicity of THY and CARV at 289 μg/mL against tumor
cells rather than healthy renal cells.30 The above findings undoubtedly establish these terpenes as potentially
safe anti-biofilm candidates. However, a detailed mechanism of action
for these natural antifungal agents against the infectious biofilm
forms is not yet known. The current study adopted an integrative approach
comprising morphological, biophysical, and biochemical studies to
elucidate the hierarchy of their action on the cellular level.

In general, terpenes can act against the fungal biofilm at the level
of the cell wall, plasma membrane, or both. The terpenes penetrate
deeply into the phospholipid bilayer because of their high hydrophobic
and partition coefficient values.31 Interestingly,
none of the terpenes targeted the biofilm via the cell wall, as no
change in MIC80/BIC80 was recorded in the presence
of osmoprotectant sorbitol (Table 1). Among the terpenes, THY and CARV showed an increase
in the BIC80 values upon addition of ergosterol, suggesting
their first line of action via membrane ergosterol sequestration leading
to pore formation (Table 2 and Figure 9; panel A). These two terpenes also significantly reduced the endogenous
ergosterol, depicting their dual action on membrane ergosterol as
well as its biosynthesis. On the other hand, CIT though did not involve
direct interaction with membrane ergosterol, but indeed it acted via
inhibition of ergosterol biosynthesis (Figures 6A and 9; panel B).
Our results were corroborated by recent reports on ergosterol biosynthesis
inhibition caused by CIT in planktonic forms of different fungal species.32,33 A comparative analysis of the membrane-rupturing properties of these
terpenes suggested that the phenolic terpenes (THY and CARV) were
more effective than the aldehydic terpene (CIT). The presence of the
hydroxyl group in phenolic terpenes enhances their hydrophilic ability,
resulting in intense membrane impairment.34

terpenes (THY, CARV, and CIT) against C. neoformans. (A) Entry of terpenes into the cell, (B) altered fatty acid metabolism/ergosterol
biosynthesis, (C) membrane permeability/fluidity changes, (D) intracellular
content and K+ ions leakage, (E) ROS generation/oxidative
stress, mitochondrial depolarization, and lipid peroxidation, (F)
antioxidant defense responses, (G) altered EPM biosynthesis pathway,
and (H) capsule size reduction. All of the above mechanisms lead to
biofilm inhibition and cell lysis. The red arrows indicate an increase
while green arrows indicate a reduction/decrease.

The second line of action of terpenes could be through lipid profile
alterations. It is well known that microbial cells adapt under stress
via modulating their SFA to UFA content, which maintains the membrane
integrity.35 The fatty acid profile of
the treated biofilm cells revealed an increase in the SFA/UFA ratio
with a significant rise in the palmitic acid content. Such an increase
in palmitic acid makes the cell membrane more rigid and less fluid,
thereby disrupting membrane integrity through its aggregation and
pore formation (Figures 4C, 9; panel C, and Table S2).36 The PI incorporation into
the biofilm cells confirmed the increased permeability and irreversible
perturbations of membrane integrity caused by the terpenes (Figure 6E,F).33 The above findings corroborated with previous
studies on planktonic forms of Listeria monocytogenes, Pseudomonas fluorescens, S. aureus, Shewanella putrifaciens, and C. albicans treated with different
EOs and EO-ACs.23,35,37,38 Such pore formation results in the damage
of cell membrane and consequent efflux of intracellular contents including
K+ ions, nucleotides/DNA/RNA, and protein (Figures 6B–D and 9; panel D).

The dysregulation of ion homeostasis because
of K+ efflux and depolarization of mitochondrial membrane
triggers ROS generation, resulting in oxidative stress which could
be the third line of action of these terpenes against biofilm cells
(Figures 7, 8A, and 9; panel E).39,40 In line with our results, recent studies have validated the antimicrobial
action of a few terpenes, which were positively related to the ROS
accumulation.41,42 The undesirable accumulation
of ROS not only disrupts organelle-like mitochondria or plasma membrane
but also causes oxidative damage to biological macromolecules.43 The elevated levels of TBARS in synergy with
reduced ergosterol content in biofilm cells elicited severe oxidative
degradation of membrane lipids (Figures 8C and 6A). The antioxidant
enzymes were also activated in biofilm cells as a protective response
against enhanced ROS levels to limit cell damage (Figures 8 and 9; panel F). Indeed, the extent of oxidative stress and cell survival
fate is regulated by the equilibrium between ROS generation and antioxidant
defenses.44

The enhanced ROS accumulation
and oxidative stress can also attenuate the biosynthesis of the capsule.45 The capsule GXM forms the major portion of EPM
composition, which plays a crucial role in the resistance against
antifungal drugs.26 A significant reduction
in the capsule size and total carbohydrate content of EPM after terpene
treatment indicates their final line of action (Figures 3B and 9; panel G).
Recently, Panariello et al. reported a similar reduction in alkali
and water-soluble polysaccharides of FLC susceptible Candida sp. EPM.46 The
release of capsular polysaccharide on to the external surface to form
EPM is essential for C. neoformans adhesion
and biofilm development.47 The GXM comprises
>90% of the capsule’s polysaccharide in addition to galactoxylomannan
and mannoproteins.48 Glycosyl composition
analysis demonstrated a significant reduction in GXM sugar components,
that is, glucuronic acid, xylose, and mannose (Figure 3C). The negative charge of cryptococcal cell
capsule is by virtue of the glucuronic acid residues, and thus reduction
in its content changes the cell surface charge. The reduction in the
magnitude of negative charge obtained from the zeta potential (ZP)
analysis substantiated the decrease in the capsule size (Figure 5).49 Further, a significant decline in the rhamnose content
of EPM was also observed (Figure 3C). Rhamnose is involved in adhesion and quorum sensing
properties of cells in the biofilm.50 Therefore,
a decrease in the rhamnose content disrupts the biofilm EPM, leading
to partial deactivation of the diffusion barrier. Henceforth, this
course of events leads to a decrease in the EPM and cause biofilm
inhibition (Figure 9; panel H).

4 Concluding Remarks
In summary, this is the first comprehensive report outlining the
mode of action of small/amphipathic phenolic (THY/CARV) and aldehydic
(CIT) terpenes against the C. neoformans biofilm. In general, all three terpenes followed a unified mechanism
of action through multiple targets. However, the phenolic terpenes
differed from aldehydic terpenes in their action at the level of cell
membrane through selective sequestration of membrane ergosterol resulting
in pore formation. At the intracellular level, both the group of terpenes
mediated their action via a common mechanism including ergosterol
biosynthesis inhibition, K+/DNA/RNA efflux, ROS generation,
and lipid peroxidation. In addition, oxidative stress caused reduction
of the capsule size and EPM production, disrupting the structural
and functional integrity of the C. neoformans biofilm. This study highlights the dual action of phenolic terpenes
responsible for their more effectiveness in comparison to aldehydic
terpenes. It also establishes a baseline for future studies focusing
on the mode of action of these terpenes against different pathogenic
biofilms. Moreover, the safety (as recognized by Food and Drug Administration,
USA)51 and efficacy of terpenes project
these natural agents as a potential treatment option for device-associated
biofilm infection. Furthermore, the structure of terpenes can act
as a template for the development of novel therapeutic formulation
against biofilms.

5 Materials and Methods
5.1 Chemicals, Fungal Strain, and Growth Condition
Analytical
grade THY (≥99%), CARV (≥99%), and CIT (≥95%)
and standard antifungal drugs AMB, NYS, CASP, and FLC were purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich, USA. A standard strain of C. neoformans (NCIM 3541 equivalent to ATCC 32045) isolated from an environmental
source was procured from the National Collection of Industrial Microorganism,
Pune. The strain was maintained on Sabouraud dextrose agar (HiMedia,
India) at 4 °C. All experiments were carried out in conformity
with Biosafety Level 2 (BSL-2) guidelines.

5.2 Biofilm
Formation and Treatment Conditions
Biofilm formation was
initiated by growing C. neoformans in
Sabouraud dextrose broth (HiMedia, India) at 30 °C in an incubator
shaker (150 rpm) for 24 h. After incubation, the pellet was centrifuged
and washed thrice with sterile 1× phosphate-buffered saline (PBS
pH 7, 0.1 M) to remove debris. The cells were then counted and resuspended
at the density of 2 × 108 cells/mL in minimal medium
(20 mg/mL thiamine, 30 mM glucose, 26 mM glycine, 20 mM MgSO4 × 7H2O, and 58.8 mM KH2PO4). The suspension with a final density of 1 × 108 cells/mL in minimal media was added to fetal bovine serum (FBS,
Gibco, United States)-pretreated 12-well culture plates, followed
by static incubation for 24 h at 30 °C to form biofilms.52 The BIC80 (lowest concentration of
terpenes/drugs that cause 80% inhibition of the metabolic activity
of biofilm formation) of terpenes/drugs were determined using the
XTT reduction assay.17 In the present study,
sub-biofilm inhibitory concentration dosage (0.5× or 1/2 BIC80) and time period of treatment (6 h after 24 h biofilm formation)
were used to obtain substantial biomass for conducting various biophysical
and biochemical assays and to analyze the response of biofilm cells
against terpenes. These experimental conditions were considered on
the basis of fungicidal kinetics of terpenes against C. neoformans (Figure S4).

5.3 Effect of Phenolic and Aldehydic Terpenes
on the Surface Topography
5.3.1 FE-SEM and AFM Analysis
The 24 h biofilm formed on FBS-pretreated polystyrene discs in
12-well culture plates were subjected to treatment with 0.5×
or 1/2 BIC80 of THY (16 μg/mL), CARV (32 μg/mL),
and CIT (64 μg/mL) for another 6 h at 30 °C. The biofilm
wells with 1% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) in minimal medium and without
terpenes served as CK (control). The CK and terpene-treated biofilms
were then washed with sterile 1× PBS and fixed overnight with
2.5% glutaraldehyde. Following fixation, the biofilm was dehydrated
in a series of ethanol solution (10–100%). For FE-SEM, the
samples were dried, gold-sputtered, and visualized under the high-vacuum
mode (15 kV) of a field emission scanning electron microscope (Quanta
200 FEG, USA). For the AFM analysis, the biofilm samples were air-dried
followed by observation under an atomic force microscope (NT-MDT-INTEGRA,
Ireland) in the contact mode with a reflex-coated silicon cantilever.
The quantitative analysis related to cell height and surface roughness
was done using automated NovaPX software integrated with the AFM instrument.
The analysis was performed considering 4–5 images comprising
50 cells per treatment.

5.4 Estimation
of Biomolecular Components in EPM after Terpene Treatment
5.4.1 Isolation of EPM
The preformed biofilm (24 h) on 12-well
culture plates (FBS pretreated) was treated with THY (16 μg/mL),
CARV (32 μg/mL), and CIT (64 μg/mL) for 6 h at 30 °C.
The CK and terpene-treated biofilms were washed with sterile 1×
PBS to remove nonadherent cells. The true biofilms were scraped from
the bottom of the plate well with a sterilized micropipette tip and
resuspended into Milli-Q water. For EPM isolation, the biofilm suspension
was pooled and subjected to ultrasonication (Q700 sonicator, QSonica,
Newtown, CT, USA) for 3 min @ 40 kHz.53 The cell suspension was centrifuged (12 000 rpm) at 4 °C
for 20 min, and the supernatant containing EPM was filtered through
a 0.22 μm sterile syringe filter (Axiva, India). The separated
pellet (biofilm cells) and EPM were analyzed (quantitative/qualitative)
individually to assess the alternations in various biomolecules.

5.4.2 Qualitative and Quantitative Analyses of EPM
The CK and terpene-treated EPM samples were ethanol-precipitated
and freeze-dried. Triple volumes of 100% cold ethanol were added to
the EPM samples, followed by incubation in ice for 2 h. The precipitates
formed were centrifuged (12 500 rpm, 20 min) at 4 °C and
then freeze dried in a lyophilizer for overnight. For qualitative
analysis, FT-IR spectroscopy (Thermo Nicolet NEXUS, USA) was performed
for each sample (100 mg) at a range of 400–4000 cm–1 wavenumber. The samples were prepared using the potassium bromide-disk
technique.

For the quantitative analysis, total carbohydrates
and protein content in 100 mg sample of CK and terpene-treated EPM
were determined. Polysaccharide content in the EPM was estimated by
the phenol–sulphuric acid method54 with glucose as the standard. The absorbance was measured at 485
nm using a spectrophotometer (Lasany, LI-2800 UV–visible double
beam). The total protein content in the EPM was quantified by the
Bradford method55 using bovine serum albumin
(BSA) as a standard followed by measurement at 592 nm in the microtiter
plate reader (SpectraMax M2, Molecular Devices). The glycosyl composition
of the EPM (CK and terpene-treated) was quantitatively analyzed using
gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS).56 Methyl glycosides were obtained by dissolving
the dried samples (100 mg) in 100 μL of 20 mg/mL methoxyamine
hydrochloride solution in pyridine (Sigma) and incubating the mixture
at 75 °C for 30 min. The methyl glycosides samples were then
trimethylsilylated (TMS) by adding 100 μL of N-methyl-N-trimethylsilyl trifluoroacetamide (Sigma)
at 70 °C for 30 min. The analysis of the TMS methyl glycosides
was performed using GC–MS (Agilent Technologies, USA) in a
DB-5 capillary column (30 mm × 0.25 mm × 1 μm) with
electron ionization of 70 eV and helium as the carrier gas at a flow
rate of 1 mL/min. TMS methyl glycosides sample (1 μL) was injected
at 250 °C in split mode (1:25). For analysis, the initial oven
temperature was held at 70 °C for 2 min, ramped to 300 °C
at a rate of 10 °C/min, and held for 5 min. TMS methyl glycosides
were identified using the NIST 2005 database library.

5.5 Estimation of Biomolecular Components in Biofilm Cells
The cellular biofilm biomass of CK and terpene-treated samples obtained
after EPM isolation was vacuum freeze-dried. Each biofilm cell sample
(100 mg) was then grounded to get a homogeneous cell freeze-dried
powder for the biomolecular composition (lipid, protein, and carbohydrate)
analysis. FT-IR measurements were performed as described in Section 5.4.2.

Total lipids were isolated using the modified Bligh and Dyer method.57 The total lipids were estimated gravimetrically,
and the lipid content (%) was calculated by the following equation  

The total nitrogen content in the lipid-extracted
biofilm biomass was determined using a CHNS elemental analyzer (Thermo
Scientific, USA). The total crude protein was evaluated using the
following equation:58  

The total amount of carbohydrate in the lipid-extracted biofilm biomass
was quantified using the phenol–sulphuric acid method with
glucose as the standard.54

5.5.1 Fatty Acid Composition Analysis of Biofilm Cells
The
24 h biofilm was treated with THY (8, 16, and 32 μg/mL), CAR
(16, 32, and 64 μg/mL), and CIT (32, 64, and 128 μg/mL)
at their respective 0.25× or 1/4 BIC80, 0.5×
or 1/2 BIC80, and 1× BIC80 for 6 h at 30
°C. The CK and terpene-treated biofilm cells were washed to remove
nonattached cells, and the resultant true biofilm was scraped. The
collected biofilm samples (100 mg) were subjected to total lipid extraction
followed by trans-esterification into fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs)
by treatment of extracted lipids with methanolic sulphuric acid (6%)
at 90 °C for 1 h. Further, hexane and distilled water (2:1 v/v)
were added to the suspension and centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 5 min.
The hexane containing FAMEs were then analyzed using GC–MS
using a DB-5 capillary column. The FAME sample (1 μL) was injected
at 250 °C in the split-less mode. The oven temperature was sequentially
increased from the initial 50 to 180 °C and finally to 250 °C
for 3 min.58 The FAMEs were identified
and quantified by analyzing their retention times in search against
the NIST library. The data were expressed as a relative percentage
of each fatty acid to the total fatty acid area.

5.6 Effect of Terpenes on the Cell Wall and Capsule
5.6.1 Sorbitol Protection Assay
Sorbitol assay was performed
for planktonic cells and biofilm cells using the broth microdilution
method and the biofilm formation assay in 96-well plates, as described
previously with modifications.17 For planktonic
and biofilm cells, duplicate plates with wells containing the cell
suspension (1–5 × 104 cells/mL and 2 ×
108 cells/mL) in respective yeast nitrogen base (YNB) and
minimal medium plus serially double diluted concentration of terpenes/CASP
(2–1024 μg/mL) were prepared. The wells with 1% DMSO
in YNB (planktonic cells) and minimal medium (biofilm cells) but without
terpenes/drugs served as CK (control). One plate in the presence of
sorbitol (0.8 M) and the other in the absence of sorbitol were incubated
at 30 °C for 48 h and 7 days.59 After
incubation, MIC80 (lowest concentration of terpenes/drugs
that cause 80% reduction of cell growth) for planktonic cells was
determined by measuring absorbance at 530 nm, while BIC80 was determined by the colorimetric XTT reduction assay following
measurement at 492 nm using a microtiter plate reader (SpectraMax,
Molecular Devices, USA).

5.6.2 Capsule Size and Surface
Charge Analysis
The formed biofilms (24 h) were treated at
0.5× or 1/2 BIC80 of THY (16 μg/mL), CARV (32
μg/mL), and CIT (64 μg/mL) for 6 h at 30 °C. The
CK and terpene-treated biofilm samples were washed, scraped, and collected
after centrifugation. The biofilm cells at a density of 104 cells/mL were resuspended in PBS, and a drop of Indian ink was added
to each sample. The CK and terpene-treated samples were spread on
slides followed by visualization under an optical microscope 100×
(Axioplan; Carl Zeiss, Germany) for capsule measurement. Capsule size
was measured as the difference between the cell wall and the outermost
edge of the capsule. The measurements were performed by counting the
capsule size of ∼50 cells using ImageJ software (National Institutes
of Health, NIH, United States).60 The surface
charge on the CK and terpene-treated biofilm cells were estimated
in suspension using a zeta sizer under 80 mV applied electric field
at 25 °C (Malvern Zetasizer Nano Z-590 equipment). ZP values
were calculated using Malvern software (version 7.03) as the average
of 10 independent measurements, each obtained as the mean of 30 cell
counts.61

5.7 Effect
of Terpenes on Membrane Permeability and Integrity
5.7.1 Ergosterol-Binding Assay
The binding of terpenes to
membrane ergosterol of C. neoformans planktonic and biofilm cells was assessed using the method described
previously by Escalante et al. with minor modifications.62 The duplicate 96-well plates for planktonic
and biofilm cells were prepared as described above (in Section 5.6.1) with (2–1024
μg/mL) terpenes/positive control (AMB and NYS) in YNB and minimal
medium, respectively. One plate from each duplicate plate for planktonic
and biofilm cells was incubated in the absence and the other in the
presence of exogenous ergosterol (100, 200, and 400 μg/mL) at
30 °C for 48 h. The MIC80 and BIC80 were
determined as described above in Section 5.6.1.

5.7.2 Ergosterol
Quantification Assay
The total intracellular ergosterol amount
in 24 h formed biofilm after 6 h of treatment in the absence and presence
of 0.25× or 1/4 BIC80, 0.5× or 1/2 BIC80, and 1× BIC80 of THY (8, 16, and 32 μg/mL),
CARV (16, 32, and 64 μg/mL), and CIT (32, 64, and 128 μg/mL)
with FLC (32, 64, and 128 μg/mL) as the positive control at
30 °C was quantified by adopting the method of Khan et al.63 Absorbances at 230 and 281.5 nm were recorded
for detection of the 24(28) DHE (dehydroergosterol), an intermediary
of the ergosterol pathway and ergosterol in the organic phase, respectively.
The ergosterol content was estimated as a percentage of the wet weight
of the cell pellet (100 mg) by the following equations  where F is the ethanol dilution factor and E is
the molar extinction coefficient value of 290 and 518 determined in
terms of % per cm for crystalline ergosterol and 24(28) DHE, respectively.64

5.7.3 Extracellular Potassium
Leakage Assay
Extracellular K+ leakage from the
biofilm cells was estimated as described by Watanabe et al., with
slight modifications.65 Briefly, the 24
h biofilm cultured in minimal media was washed with 1× PBS to
remove nonadherent cells. The resultant true biofilm was scraped,
and the cells were collected by centrifugation (4000 rpm, 5 min) followed
by washing with deionized water. The cells were resuspended at a concentration
of 5 × 104 biofilm cells/mL in deionized water, and
1 mL of this suspension was incubated with 1/2 BIC80 concentration
of THY (16 μg/mL), CARV (32 μg/mL), and CIT (64 μg/mL)
for 2, 4, 6, and 8 h at 30 °C. C. neoformans biofilm cells incubated with deionized water only was used as CK.
After treatment, the samples were collected by centrifugation (10 000
rpm) for 10 min, and the supernatant was stored for the estimation
of extracellular K+ content released into the deionized
water. The K+ concentration was determined using inductively
coupled plasma mass spectrometer (PerkinElmer, USA).

5.7.4 Intracellular Content and Protein Release
The biofilm
formed in minimal media at 30 °C for 24 h was scraped, washed,
and resuspended in phosphate buffer (0.1 M, pH 7.5). Two sets of four
microcentrifuge tubes, each containing an inoculum of 5 × 104 biofilm cells/mL without and with 0.5× or 1/2 BIC80 concentrations of THY (16 μg/mL), CARV (32 μg/mL),
and CIT (64 μg/mL) were incubated at 30 °C for a series
of time intervals ranging from 0 to 8 h. After incubation, the cell
suspension was centrifuged (10 min at 10 000 rpm) and the supernatants
(100 μL) were collected. The absorbance of one set of supernatant
was measured at 260 nm and the other set at 280 nm using an ultraviolet–visible
(UV–vis) spectrophotometer to estimate the release of intracellular
content (DNA/RNA/Nucleotides) and protein, respectively.66

5.7.5 Plasma Membrane Integrity
Assay
The 24 h biofilms after treatment with 0.5× or
1/2 BIC80 of THY (16 μg/mL), CARV (32 μg/mL),
CIT (64 μg/mL), and AMB (2 μg/mL) as a positive control
for 6 h at 30 °C were washed with PBS and collected. The CK and
treated biofilm cells (106 cells/mL) were resuspended in
PBS and transferred into microcentrifuge tubes. Then, 1 mg/mL PI (Sigma-Aldrich)
dye was added to each of the above tubes and incubated in the dark
(30 min) at 37 °C. After incubation, the cells were washed twice
with 1× PBS to eliminate the excess dye, and the fluorescence
was measured using a fluorometer (Fluorolog-3 LS55, Horiba Jobin Yvon
Spex, Edison, NJ, USA) with the excitation and emission wavelengths
of 535 and 617 nm, respectively, and the images were captured using
a fluorescence microscope (Axioplan; Carl Zeiss, Germany).67

5.8 Oxidative Stress and Antioxidant
Defense System Responses after Terpene Treatment
The 24 h
biofilm was treated with 0.5× or 1/2 BIC80 of THY
(16 μg/mL), CARV (32 μg/mL), and CIT (64 μg/mL)
and 5 mM HP (positive control) for 6 h at 30 °C.

5.8.1 Assessment of Mitochondrial Membrane Potential
The
effect of terpenes on the mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm) was measured using fluorescent probes Rho123. The CK and
terpene-treated biofilm cells at the density of 106 cells/mL
were collected and washed with PBS followed by incubation in Rho123
(50 μM) for 30 min at 37 °C. After incubation,
the cells were washed twice with PBS to remove the excess staining
and further resuspended in PBS. The fluorescence intensity was measured
using a fluorometer with the excitation and emission wavelengths of
505 and 534 nm, respectively. Additionally, the Rho123-stained cells
were observed, and the images were captured under a fluorescent microscope.

5.8.2 ROS Quantification and Lipid Peroxidation
For endogenous ROS quantification, 10 μM of the fluorescent
probe, 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (H2DCFDA;
Sigma-Aldrich), was added to CK and terpene-treated biofilm wells
(106 cells/mL) in 12-well culture plates. The plates were
incubated at 30 °C for 30 min in the dark. After incubation,
the biofilm samples were washed with 1× PBS to reduce background
fluorescence. The fluorescence intensity was measured using a fluorometer
with excitation and emission wavelengths of 495 and 525 nm.67 Further, the DCFDA-stained cells were observed
under a fluorescence microscope and images were captured.

For
lipid peroxidation, the CK and terpene-treated biofilm cell pellet
(100 mg) was frozen and homogenized with 1 mL of chilled phosphoric
acid (1.1%). The homogenate was mixed in the ratio 1:1 with 1% thiobarbituric
acid (TBA, Sigma-Aldrich, United States) in NaOH.68 The above samples were heated at 98 °C (1 h) followed
by the addition of a double volume of butanol, and finally the mixture
was centrifuged at 4000 rpm (5 min). The absorbance of the organic
layer was measured in a quartz cuvette with a path length 1 cm at
532 nm corrected for nonspecific turbidity due to TBA abduct at 600
nm. Lipid peroxidation products, TBARS content were measured using
the following formula  where A is the absorbance in nm and EC is the extinction coefficient
(156 mM–1 cm–1).

5.8.3 SOD, CAT, and POD Activities
Cell-free extracts of
CK and the terpene-treated biofilm (100 mg) were prepared as described
previously by Khan et al., with little modifications.69 Biofilm cells were disrupted by liquid nitrogen and then
resuspended in 1 mL of grinding buffer (250 mM sucrose, 10 mM Tris-HCl,
pH 7.5, 1 mM PMSF). The above homogenate
was centrifuged at 15 000 rpm for 45 min at 4 °C. Soluble
protein was estimated using the Bradford test with BSA as the standard.
Enzyme activities were measured using a UV–vis spectrophotometer
(Cary 5000 UV–vis–NIR, Agilent, USA).

The SOD
activity was measured using the method previously described by Ferreira
et al.68 The cell-free extract (100 μL)
and pyrogallol-tris buffer (100 μL) were mixed followed by observation
of pyrogallol inhibition every 30 s for 3 min at 420 nm. The units
of SOD were measured as pyrogallol autoxidation per 200 μL and
calculated as follows  where A is the difference in absorbance per 1 min in the control, B is the difference in absorbance per 1 min in the test
samples, and df is the dilution factor. Results are expressed in U/mg
protein.

For CAT activity, 10 μL of cell-free extract
was added to 1.99 mL of phosphate buffer (0.05 M, pH 7.0) and 1.0
mL of H2O2 (0.0019 M) making a total volume
of 3.0 mL as the reaction mixture. The fall in absorbance because
of the disappearance of H2O2 was recorded for
30 s intervals up to 3 min in a quartz cuvette (path length = 1 cm)
at 240 nm (25 °C). The CAT activity was evaluated in terms of
μmol H2O2 consumed/min/mg protein using
a molar extinction coefficient of 43.6 M–1 cm–1.

For POD activity, 100 μL of the cell-free
extract was added in 25 mM N-(2-hydroxyethyl)piperazine-N′-ethanesulfonic acid solution (pH 6.8, HiMedia,
India) containing 10 mM H2O2 and 4 mM guaiacol
(HiMedia, India) and incubated for 15 min. The change in absorbance
due to tetraguaiacol formation was monitored every 30 s for 3 min
of reaction in a quartz cuvette (path length = 1 cm) at 470 nm (25
°C). POD activity was expressed in μmol/min/mg protein using a molar extinction coefficient of 26.61 M–1 cm–1.

5.9 Statistical
Analysis
All experiments were carried out in triplicate.
The data are represented as average ± standard deviation (SD).
One-way analysis of variance followed by t-test was
employed for analyzing the statistical significance between treated
and control groups. Statistically significant differences were defined
only when the p-value was less than 0.05 and are
denoted by asterisks *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, and ***p < 0.001.
