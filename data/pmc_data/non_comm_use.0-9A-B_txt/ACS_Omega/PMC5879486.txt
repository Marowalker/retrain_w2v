Although
metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) have widely demonstrated
their convenient performances as drug-delivery systems, there is still
work to do to fully understand the drug incorporation/delivery processes
from these materials. In this work, a combined experimental and computational
investigation of the main structural and physicochemical parameters
driving drug adsorption/desorption kinetics was carried out. Two model
drugs (aspirin and ibuprofen) and three water-stable, biocompatible
MOFs (MIL-100(Fe), UiO-66(Zr), and MIL-127(Fe)) have been selected
to obtain a variety of drug–matrix couples with different structural
and physicochemical characteristics. This study evidenced that the
drug-loading and drug-delivery processes are mainly governed by structural
parameters (accessibility of the framework and drug volume) as well
as the MOF/drug hydrophobic/hydrophilic balance. As a result, the
delivery of the drug under simulated cutaneous conditions (aqueous
media at 37 °C) demonstrated that these systems fulfill the requirements
to be used as topical drug-delivery systems, such as released payload
between 1 and 7 days. These results highlight the importance of the
rational selection of MOFs, evidencing the effect of geometrical and
chemical parameters of both the MOF and the drug on the drug adsorption
and release.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Once
administered, therapeutic drugs should be in a concentration
at which full efficacy is achieved with no associated side effects.1 For that purpose, several drug-delivery systems
(DDS) have been formulated and/or are being investigated for drug
administration (e.g., intravenous, oral, nasal).2,3 Among
them, metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) have recently emerged
as original promising DDS.4−7 MOFs are crystalline solids based on metal ions
subunits coordinated to organic polydentate ligands, leading to the
formation of highly porous structures.8 Their structural/chemical diversity and exceptional porosity (Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) surface (SBET) up to 7000 m2·g–1) together with their amphiphilic
internal microenvironment are thus well adapted to the adsorption
of a large variety of guest molecules, including the therapeutic ones
(e.g., drugs, cosmetics, biological gases, enzymes).4,7,9

Although MOFs have been
extensively investigated for drug administration,4,7,9,10 the
large versatility of these solids makes it difficult to predict which
is the best MOF material for a given drug molecule. Although the pore
size, chemical composition, and stability of MOFs play an essential
role in controlling the drug incorporation/delivery processes and
the total cargo capacity,10−13 studies focusing on the systematic understanding
of the encapsulation and delivery processes using MOFs still remain
very limited. To the best of our knowledge, only three works have
focused on the understanding of the drug incorporation and delivery
processes, which is crucial to improve and/or control their performances.
In this regard, Maurin and co-workers have pioneered and reported
a quantitative–structure activity relationship approach to
predict the encapsulation rate as a function of the physicochemical
properties of MOFs, validating this strategy using a series of functionalized
porous flexible Fe(III) terephthalates (MIL-88B; MIL = Materials of
Institut Lavoisier)14 or functionalized
rigid Zr(IV) terephthalates (UiO-66; UiO = University of Oslo)15 and two model active ingredients (caffeine and
ibuprofen). The drug uptake was analyzed as a function of the polarity,
polarizability, and H-donor capacity of the functionalized organic
linkers. Later, Serre and co-workers followed an experimental and
computational strategy to rationalize the encapsulation and release
of the cosmetic amphiphilic molecule, caffeine, highlighting the importance
of the encapsulation conditions and the MOF topology and polarity
on the drug uptake and delivery kinetics.16 However, all of these works are focused on the influence of the
MOF properties on the drug encapsulation, and the effect of the drug
nature on the encapsulation and delivery is not systematically considered.
So, there is no comparative study determining the main requirements/parameters
of MOFs and drug to be considered for a suitable cutaneous MOF carrier.
Thus, there is still a need to better understand the mechanisms of
drug incorporation and delivery, particularly the influence of the
drug properties on the drug sorption processes.

Taking this
into account, we have selected two topical nonsteroidal
anti-inflammatory and analgesic drugs, exhibiting different physicochemical
properties: (i) acetylsalicylic acid (also known as aspirin, AAS)
as a hydrophilic model cargo (log P = 1.19)
and (ii) isobutylphenylpropanoic acid (or ibuprofen, IBU) as hydrophobic
drug (log P = 3.97), to analyze, through a
combined experimental and computational systematic study, how these
features will affect the drug adsorption/desorption kinetics in MOF
matrixes. Besides, the well-known and common gastric mucosal damage
of these orally administered drugs,17,18 together with
their unquestioned value in the treatment of various symptoms (e.g.,
fever, pain) and inflammatory diseases (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis,
pericarditis), shows that alternative formulations need to be undertaken.17,19 In this regard, the simple and noninvasive cutaneous route is very
convenient whether for a local (topical) or systemic (transdermal)
administration.20 We note here that the
desired properties of MOFs for a cutaneous treatment significantly
differ from those required for other administration routes (stability,
delivery time, etc.). To date, MOFs have been mostly proposed for
intravenous administration,4 and only three
works have been reported dealing with the potential use of MOFs in
cutaneous applications. The first described the use of a NO-loaded
Ni carboxylate CPO-27 with two different hydrocolloids (cellulose
and polyisobutanol) for the topical (local) delivery of NO.21 The second is the study of Ni-CPO-27 or HKUST(Cu)
nanoparticles with poly(tetrafluoroethylene) patches for the local
co-delivery of NO and an antibiotic (metronidazole).22 Finally, Horcajada and co-workers have recently reported
the skin bypass of the cosmetic caffeine by using cutaneous patches
based on biocompatible MIL-100(Fe) nanoparticles associated with different
biopolymers.23 Therefore, to gain further
fundamental understanding, we analyze here the performances of several
MOF–drug systems for the cutaneous delivery of AAS and IBU.
These results will be further compared to those of the previously
published studies on caffeine-containing MIL-100, MIL-127, UiO-66,
and MIL-53 solids.16

In addition
to the MOFs and drug structural characteristics, hydrophobic/hydrophilic
balance is another key parameter, taking into account that MOFs possess
both a polar part (metal clusters) and a nonpolar fraction (aromatic
ligands). Previous water sorption experiments provide an appropriate
tool to probe the hydrophilic/hydrophobic properties of MOFs and their
stability to moisture.24,25 Hence, we have selected three
MOF architectures with different hydrophilic/hydrophobic balance (Figure 1): (i) the more hydrophilic
mesoporous MIL-100,26 or [Fe3O(H2O)2OH(BTC)2]·nH2O (H3BTC = 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylic acid
or trimesic acid) based on iron(III) octahedra trimers and trimesate
anions leading to a very high porosity (SBET ∼ 2000 m2·g–1, Vp ∼ 1.2 cm3·g–1), associated with two types of mesoporous cages (25 and 29 Å)
accessible through microporous windows (ca. 4.8–5.8 and 8.6
Å, respectively);27 (ii) the microporous
hydrophilic/hydrophobic MIL-127 structure, or [Fe3O(OH)0.88Cl0.12(C16N2O8H6)1.5(H2O)3]·nH2O (SBET > 1200
m2·g–1, Vp ∼ 0.7 cm3·g–1) based on
iron octahedra trimers and 3,3′,5,5′-azobenzenetetracarbozylate
anions, associated with two types of pores, namely, an accessible
hydrophobic one-dimensional (1D) channel system (∼6 Å)
and more hydrophilic cages of ∼10 Å, accessible through
narrow apertures of ∼3 Å;28,29 and (iii)
the microporous slightly hydrophobic UiO-66 solid or [Zr6O4(OH)4(BDC)6]·nH2O (H2BDC = 1,4-benzenedicarboxilic acid),
(SBET ∼ 1200 m2·g–1, Vp ∼ 0.5 cm3·g–1) based on zirconium(IV) oxoclusters
and terephthalate anions, possessing octahedral and tetrahedral cavities
(∼ 11 and ∼8 Å, respectively) accessible through
triangular micropores (ca. 5–7 Å).30,31

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Drug
Incorporation
The impregnation
of the porous materials with ethanolic solutions of both drugs led
in all cases to an efficient incorporation. The drug-loaded matrixes
MIL-100@AAS, MIL-100@IBU, UiO-66@AAS, UiO-66@IBU, MIL-127@AAS, and
MIL-127@IBU reached a maximum capacity after 24 h for all MOF–drug
systems. X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) patterns evidence that the
drug-loading process does not alter the crystalline structure of the
porous materials (Supporting Information (SI), Figure S6). In addition, the absence of Bragg peaks corresponding
to free AAS or IBU rules out the presence of free recrystallized drug
out of the pores.

The drug content, estimated by thermogravimetric
analysis (TGA) and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC),
was high regardless of the nature of the MOF (Table 1 and SI, Section 3). Remarkably, higher drug loadings were obtained for UiO-66, reaching
up to 35.5 and 25.5 wt % for IBU and AAS, respectively, corresponding
to 3.7 and 3.0 mol of drug per mol of material, with high efficiencies
of ca. 92 and 75% (compared to the total drug available in the starting
solution). This is particularly significant because MIL-100 and MIL-127
possess larger pore volumes than UiO-66 (Table 1). However, these results are in agreement
with the previously obtained ones for the caffeine encapsulation,
where the following classification from the highest to the lowest
caffeine loading capacity was obtained: UiO-66 > MIL-100 > MIL-127.16 Moreover, the high IBU loading capacity for
UiO-66 supported the recently published results obtained using CD-MOF-1
and the porous carbon derived from MOF PCDM-1000 (35.5 vs 26 and 32
wt %, respectively).32,33 Finally, increasing initial drug
concentrations and/or successive impregnations did not lead to any
improvement in the drug capacity.

The incorporation of AAS and IBU into the MIL-100, UiO-66, and
MIL-127 cavities was further demonstrated by the dramatic reduction
of the N2 sorption capacity of the MOFs (SI, Section 4, Figure S8). In this regard, to shed
some light on the influence of porosity on drug adsorption, we have
estimated the volume occupied by one drug molecule inside the MOF
by taking into account the variation of the MOF pore volume after
the drug encapsulation and the total amount of loaded drug (SI, Section 4, eq 1). The larger occupancy volume
of both drugs in MIL-100 and MIL-127 (IBU: 1078 and 797 Å3, AAS: 1522 and 1438 Å3, respectively) compared
to the free drug molecular volume (∼372 and 155 Å3 for IBU and AAS, respectively, as estimated under vacuum
by ChemDraw) might be due to the partial occupancy of the porosity,
as confirmed by the important remaining porosity after drug insertion
(Table 1). This could
be related to a selective adsorption of the drug that might occur
only within the larger cages of MIL-100 (accessible via hexagonal
windows of ∼8.6 Å) and the channels of MIL-127 (∼6
Å). In contrast, the dimensions of both IBU (11.0 × 5.0
× 4.3 Å3) and AAS (7.8 × 5.8 × 2.3
Å3) might prevent their loading into the smaller cages
of MIL-100 (exclusively accessible by pentagonal windows of ca. 4.8–5.8
Å) and the hydrophilic cages of MIL-127, accessible through apertures
of ∼3 Å (note that van der Waals radius has been considered).

Furthermore, in the case of MIL-100, it is known that ethanol (used
as solvent in the impregnation) can bind the coordinatively unsaturated
iron(III) metal sites (CUS), pointing to the center of the window,
then considerably reducing the free diameter of the hexagonal (from
8.2 to 4.1 Å) and pentagonal (from 4.5 to 1.7 Å) windows,
and therefore, drastically reducing the diffusion of the drugs into
the pores, particularly into the smaller cages.34 This suggests the absence of any encapsulation within the
smaller cage of MIL-100, in agreement with the selective location
of IBU within the larger cages of MIL-100(Cr), as previously proposed.10 We note here the similar IBU uptake of the Cr-based
MIL-100 and its iron-based analogue (35 vs 31 wt %), ruling out any
significant influence of the metal on the drug adsorption process.
Thus, excluding the drug adsorption within the smaller pores, this
gives a more realistic volume of the MIL-100 occupied by IBU or AAS
(44%), corresponding to drug occupancy volumes of 474 and 336 Å3.

A theoretical maximum loading was estimated by assuming
a selective
adsorption within the larger cavities of MIL-100. Such predictions,
corresponding to 1.0 (IBU) and 1.6 (AAS) mol·mol–1, illustrate two different situations: in the case of IBU the maximal
capacity is reached (1 mol·mol–1), whereas
it is not the case for MIL-100@AAS (1.6 vs 1.0 mol·mol–1). Lin et al.35 have recently reported
an exceptionally high loading of 1.8 g of AAS per gram of MIL-100
(6.5 mol·mol–1) with however a residual porosity
of 64% after encapsulation. This high residual porosity (SBET = 1141 m2·g–1, Vp = 0.62 cm3·g–1), in agreement with a partial occupation of the MIL-100 porosity,
was however not consistent with the location of the drug exclusively
within the pores. Even considering a full occupancy of both cavities,
the maximum theoretical amount of encapsulated AAS in MIL-100 shall
indeed not exceed 1.09 g·g–1 (3.9 mmol·mol–1). In addition, drug estimation from Lin’s
TGA fits better with a lower “more realistic” encapsulation
rate of around 21.0 wt % (ca. 40 wt loss % corresponding to both AAS
and linker), in line with our results (25.5 wt %).

Similarly
to MIL-100, one could expect a selective adsorption of
the drug within the microporous channels of MIL-127. Here, only ca.
19% of the total free volume can be occupied by IBU and AAS, which
corresponds to occupancy volumes of 250 and 241 Å3, respectively, which is also, on the whole, in agreement with the
free drug volumes (∼372 and 155 Å3, respectively).

Estimating the theoretical maximum loading by assuming a selective
adsorption within the channels, we find that the theoretical maximum
AAS cargo is higher than the experimental data (1.01 vs 0.27 mol·mol–1), suggesting that the maximum drug capacity is not
reached. On the other hand, the experimental data of IBU adsorption
(0.5 mol·mol–1) fit well with the theoretical
data of IBU cargo (0.42 mol·mol–1). We note
here that IBU seems to occupy a lower volume when encapsulated in
MIL-127 than in the free state, suggesting an improved packing probably
due to the formation of weak interactions between drug molecules and
the ABTC ligand.

Finally, both UiO-66@IBU and UiO-66@AAS solids
keep a significant
residual porosity (383 and 735 m2·g–1, respectively). We note that octahedral and tetrahedral cavities
in UiO-66 are accessible through a unique type of windows, which favors
a higher loading than that in MIL-100 or MIL-127. Moreover, the presence
of functional groups on the benzene ring of AAS or IBU (ester, carboxylic
acids, and an alkyl side chain) might lead to various weak interactions
(e.g., hydrogen bonding, van der Waals, π–π staking)
within the pores of UiO-66, which may further enhance their loading
into the pores. This should also explain the difference between the
free AAS molecular volume (155 Å3) and that inside
the UiO-66 framework (199 Å3) consistent with a more
efficient AAS packing to minimize free volume. As an intermediate
conclusion, although the pore volume and surface area of MOFs as well
as the nature of solvent (see below) used for the encapsulation are
key parameters to drive the encapsulation capacity, one has also to
consider the correlation between the size and shape of both the pores
and the drug to determine whether the drug can be adsorbed and to
which extent.

Apart from these important geometrical parameters,
other factors
such as the chemical nature of both the MOF and the drug strongly
influence the drug loading. As previously mentioned, despite the general
amphiphilic character of MIL-100, MIL-127, and UiO-66 solids, one
could comparatively propose the following order from the more hydrophilic
to the more hydrophobic material: MIL-100 > MIL-127 > UiO-66.
Thus,
in the case of UiO-66 and MIL-127, we observe an influence of the
hydrophilic/hydrophobic balance of the matrix: the lipophilic IBU
(3.7 and 0.5 mol·mol–1, respectively) is retained
higher than the hydrophilic AAS (3.0 and 1.0 mol·mol–1, respectively). In contrast, the drug uptake in the hydrophilic
MIL-100 matrix does not depend on the differences of polarity of these
drugs because both molecules are similarly adsorbed (1.0 mol·mol–1 in both cases). Structural reasons may explain these
results. The larger cage in the MIL-100 framework, in which the drug
adsorption process preferentially occurs, might be large enough to
allow interaction with both the hydrophobic (linker) and hydrophilic
(metal trimers) parts of the pores, regardless of the nature of the
cargo. These results are in agreement with the exceptional ability
of this MOF to adsorb molecules bearing very different polarities
(e.g., IBU (hydrophobic); caffeine and busulfan (amphiphilic); RAPTA-C,
urea, and phosphorylated nucleoside analogues (hydrophilic); etc.).36,37

To gain further understanding of the drug adsorption process,
we
studied in detail the solid–liquid adsorption isotherms (at
25 °C) of IBU (hydrophobic) and AAS (hydrophilic) in the materials
showing an extreme hydrophobic/hydrophilic nature: MIL-100 (hydrophilic)
and UiO-66 (hydrophobic) (Figure 2). A relatively fast drug uptake was observed in all
cases, with a maximum drug loading reached after ∼6 and 24
h for UiO-66 and MIL-100, respectively. In the case of UiO-66, loadings
higher than ca. 24 wt % are even obtained during the first hour, corresponding
to 97% (IBU) and 77% (AAS) of its total drug capacity. We note that
the drug incorporation process in MIL-100 is prolonged, with loading
rates of ca. 14% during the first 3 h, which corresponds to total
drug capacities of 53% (IBU) and 56% (AAS).

Figure 2 IBU (hydrophobic) and
AAS (hydrophilic) encapsulation kinetics
in MIL-100 (hydrophilic) and UiO-66 (hydrophobic) matrixes. Adjustment
of the drug adsorption data to a zero-order kinetic equation, with
different zero-order kinetic constants (K), regression
factors (R2), and total drug loadings
(wt %).

The data obtained after 1 or 3
h (UiO-66 and MIL-100, respectively)
can be empirically adjusted to a zero-order kinetics (Figure 2, eq 2), where [drug] is the
concentration of the drug into the ethanolic solution (M) at equilibrium
and at the time t (h) and K is the
zero-order kinetic constant (M·h–1). By estimating
the K values, we confirmed a drug adsorption process
more than 6 times faster in UiO-66 than in MIL-100, consistent with
a better drug–MOF affinity. Differences in terms of pore accessibility
might be at the origin of these differences. As previously mentioned,
AAS and IBU fit in both octahedral and tetrahedral cavities of UiO-66,
but not into the smaller cages of MIL-100. In addition, the ethanol
molecules considerably reduce the accessibility of the hexagonal windows
in MIL-100, through coordination on the iron metal sites pointing
at the center of the windows, leading to a slower diffusion of the
drug, as seen before with caffeine in MIL-100.16 Moreover, as previously studied in the use of MOFs for
the separation of racemic mixtures of (±)-IBU,38,39 one expects here host–guest interactions associated with
the presence of −CO2H or C=O moieties from
the drugs able to interact with the hexameric or trimeric oxoclusters
of the hybrid solids. Indeed, the 13C NMR spectra of the
MIL-100(Cr)@IBU analogue showed previously the possible coordination
of IBU to the MIL-100 structure.6 Fourier
transform infrared (FTIR) spectra of both drug-loaded materials confirmed
a shift in the wavelengths in comparison to the pure AAS and IBU,
characteristic of the ν(C=O) groups, suggesting the formation
of interactions between drugs moieties and the hybrid framework (SI, Section 5, Figure S9 and Table S2). These results
are in agreement with those previously published for the caffeine
loaded MIL-100, UiO-66, and MIL-127, where a shift in the wavelengths
of the ν(C=O) groups of caffeine was also observed.16 Molecular simulations confirm such results when
the configurations of the drugs are extracted (see Figure S16). In fact, interactions of C=O from AAS
can be observed as predominant in UiO-66. All of these results evidence
the importance of the selection of the right MOF (pores and windows
dimensions) to be used as DDS.

When one considers the configuration
of the AAS adsorbed in MIL-127,
the main interactions are between the C=O of the drug and coordinated
water molecules. This is in agreement with the saturation of metal
centers with water molecules. However, in the case of IBU-loaded material,
the benzene rings of the drug mainly interact with the N=N
moieties of the framework (see Figure S17). In contrast to MIL-100, π-stacking is not observed here
due to the smaller pore size of MIL-127.

In conclusion, drug–matrix
interactions are rather weak
here. It should be noted however that our simulations do not take
into account any possible coordination of the metal sites, as suggested
before for MIL-100(Cr) and IBU, or the impact of the solvent, which
certainly affects the nature of the drug–matrix interactions.

2.2 Drug Release
Once the porous matrixes
were loaded, we evaluated their ability to deliver AAS or IBU to consider
them as topical DDS. The delivery of the cargoes was performed in
distilled water at 37 °C, under continuous bidimensional stirring,
to evaluate a potential cutaneous administration, mimicking the hydration
of a cutaneous patch to evaluate and compare the delivery kinetics
of these solids as a function of their features. In addition, the
high stability of these MOFs might rule out any impact of the MOF
degradation on the release profiles, thus allowing a better understanding
of the effect of other parameters (polarity, interactions, etc.).
To confirm the stability of the MOF matrixes, the leaching of ligands
to the water medium was further monitored by HPLC (Figure S10), confirming the stability of all MOFs (<2%).
In particular, only 1.65, 1.02, and 0.04% of degradation were observed
for UiO-66, MIL-100, and MIL-127, respectively, after 3 days, which
could also correspond to the release of residual free linker initially
trapped in the pores of these MOFs.

The release kinetics were
determined by quantifying the amount of delivered drug in the medium
by HPLC as a function of time (Figure 3). According to the drug-release profiles, the MOF–drug
systems can be divided into two groups: a complete and fast release
for MIL-100@IBU, MIL-100@AAS, and UiO-66@AAS, against a partial and
slower release for MIL-127@AAS, MIL-127@IBU, and UiO-66@IBU (Figure 3). In particular,
and considering its high aqueous stability, the slow and sustained
cargo release from MIL-127 is probably governed by the slow diffusion
of the drugs through its 1D channels. We note that the total amounts
of released drug are only 48 ± 2% (IBU) and 37 ± 2% (AAS)
after 1 day of release. In the case of MIL-100, both drugs are released
faster regardless of the nature of the cargo (hydrophilic or hydrophobic).
In 1 day, MIL-100 progressively releases almost the total amount of
both drugs (99 ± 1 and 84 ± 5% of the total amount of AAS
and IBU, respectively). This is likely due to the larger pores (windows,
cages) facilitating the diffusion of the drugs, although direct coordination
of these drugs on the metal sites is likely to occur in MIL-100, as
said before. In the case of UiO-66, the delivery seems more influenced
by the degree of hydrophobicity of the adsorbate because a significant
difference between the delivery of AAS and IBU is observed. After
1 day, UiO-66@AAS releases indeed 96 ± 2% of the total AAS amount,
whereas only 46 ± 2% of its cargo is delivered from UiO-66@IBU.
The concomitant hydrophobicities of UiO-66 and IBU probably lead to
even slower water diffusion into the porosity and, subsequently, a
slower release of the drug. In contrast, the hydrophilic AAS molecule
leads to faster delivery, similar to the one observed in MIL-100.

Figure 3 AAS and
IBU released from the different MOFs under simulated cutaneous
conditions (aqueous media at 37 °C).

As a whole, one can conclude that the drug delivery in water
is
mainly governed by the drug hydrophobic/hydrophilic balance as well
as the accessibility of the pores as highlighted here: (i) the more
hydrophilic MIL-100 with very large interconnected cavities, in which
the delivery process is mainly governed by the very open character
of the structure (fast delivery); (ii) the hydrophobic/hydrophilic
environment of MIL-127 together with narrow 1D channels (slow delivery),
and finally, (iii) the more hydrophobic UiO-66 matrix with interconnected
microporous cavities, leading to rather different rates of delivery,
depending on the hydrophobic/hydrophilic nature of the cargo

Furthermore, the possible clinical translation of these MOF@drug
systems as cutaneous DDS requires considering the total time and the
total amount of the released drug. As mentioned before, specific features,
differing from other administration routes, are desired for DDS for
cutaneous route. In this regard, cutaneous systems are designed normally
to deliver drugs from 1 to 7 days.40 In
this regard, some examples of other materials (silicon microneedles,
mesoporous silica) have shown promising results in the dermal delivery
of bioactive compounds (nonviral gene, methotrexate anticancer drug)
for 24 h.41,42 The total amounts of AAS and IBU are released
from MIL-100 within 1 and 4 days, respectively (Figure S11), being of interest for the topical and/or transdermal
administration of analgesic and anti-inflammatory drugs. As previously
mentioned, nanoscale MIL-100 combined with different biopolymers has
been recently reported for its use as cutaneous patches for the delivery
of caffeine, evidencing a successful drug skin bypass dependent on
the nature of the biopolymer.23 We note
here that IBU was released from this composite patch in a similar
way to the micrometric pure MIL-100 (e.g., 40% of IBU is released
in 3 h), suggesting that the release from the patch is mainly controlled
by the MOF. UiO-66-loaded materials released 96 ± 2 and 81 ±
6% of the total AAS and IBU cargo in 1 and 7 days, respectively, and
the MIL-127@IBU and MIL-127@AAS delivered 92 ± 5 and 61 ±
4% of the drug in 4 and 6 days, respectively. So, besides being biocompatible
and highly stable,43−45 MIL-100, UiO-66, and MIL-127 materials are good candidates
as cutaneous DDS.

The release profiles in play here lie within
the same range when
further compared to previous delivery studies of AAS and/or IBU from
Fe-CPO-27@IBU (100%, 4 days, phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)),46 MIL-100(Cr)@IBU (100%, 3 days, simulated body
fluid (SBF)), MIL-101(Cr)@IBU (100%, 6 days, SBF),10 MIL-100(Fe)@AAS (33%, 10 days, PBS; 2%, 7 days, pH 1.2),35 or Zn3(BTC)2@IBU (34%,
1 day, PBS),47 except for the flexible
MOFs, in which much longer delivery times were observed: MIL-53(Cr)@IBU
(100%, 18 days, SBF) and MIL-53(Fe)@IBU (100%, 20 days, SBF).48 However, as most of the studies described in
the literature were performed under different conditions (e.g., simulated
gastric conditions (pH 1.2) or intravenous conditions (e.g., PBS,
SBF)), a direct comparison is not possible because it is known that
the composition of the media (e.g., ions, proteins) strongly affects
the drug release kinetics.

On the basis of the previous drug-delivery
results obtained with
the amphiphilic cosmetic caffeine and the ones obtained here for the
AAS and IBU, we can further see the influence of the nature of the
active pharmaceutical ingredient on the delivery process. In this
regard, when one considers studies dealing with the delivery of caffeine
from MIL-100, UiO-66, and MIL-127 in water at 37 °C, similar
results (from fast to slow release: MIL-100 ≥ UiO-66 ≥
MIL-127) were obtained.16 This indicates
that the delivery from MIL-100 and MIL-127 is less affected by the
hydrophilic/hydrophobic balance of the adsorbate, whereas in the cases
of UiO-66, the nature of the adsorbate molecule strongly determines
its interaction with the matrix and, consequently, its release. When
comparing all studied drugs in the case of UiO-66, the release rate
can indeed be classified as follows (from the faster to the slower):
AAS (hydrophilic, 1 day) > caffeine (amphiphilic, 2 days) ≫
IBU (hydrophobic, 7 days).

To shed some light on the release
kinetics and to gain further
understanding on the involved mechanism, the first hours of delivery
(up to 1 h for AAS and 6 h for IBU) were fitted to a mathematical
model. In particular, the Higuchi model, which defines the short time
behavior of the release of a dispersed drug from a homogeneous matrix,49 has been used to describe the diffusion of drugs
from porous materials.6,50,51 This commonly used equation perfectly describes release processes
through which the drug is dispersed in stable monolithic systems (with
no changes during the release process, which is the case when using
these aqueous stable MOFs), being the release purely controlled by
diffusion.49,52 Considering that the external
diffusion process around the MOF particles is minimized by continuous
stirring during the delivery assay, the desorption process is only
due to the drug movements through the pores of the frameworks. Therefore,
the AAS and IBU delivery from the studied matrixes can be explained
by the following equation 1  where [drug] corresponds to the concentration
of released drug (mg·g–1), t is the time (h), and K is the kinetic constant
(g·mg–1·h–1/2).

Except for MIL-127@IBU, with regression factor (R2) value slightly below 0.99, the rest of the drug releases
can be empirically adjusted in the first hour (AAS) and the sixth
hour (IBU) to the Higuchi model with R2 > 0.99 (Table 2; Figure S12). Therefore, the drug release
is here
mainly governed by a diffusion process, predictable by the Higuchi
model and dependent on several factors such as the structure (dimensionality,
interconnectivity, pore size) and composition (polarity, interactions).
The initial delivery rate can be easily compared by estimating the
constant diffusion coefficients (Table 2), observing the following classification from the
faster to the slower initial release kinetics: UiO-66@AAS > MIL-100@AAS
≫ MIL-100@IBU ≫ UiO-66@IBU ≫> MIL-127@IBU
≫>
MIL-127@AAS. In addition, kinetic constants associated with the IBU
delivery are always lower than those of AAS, in agreement with the
hydrophobicity of IBU.

b H = Higuchi model; 0 = zero-order
kinetics.

In the particular
case of MIL-127@IBU, a better fit can be obtained
by using a zero-order kinetic 2  where [drug] corresponds to the concentration
of released drug (mg·g–1), t is the time (h), and K is the kinetic constant
(g·mg–1·h–1, Figure S12). This means that the release process
takes place at a constant rate, regardless of the remaining drug concentration,
with an incomplete release of 92%. Therefore, it can be assumed that
MIL-127 leads to a well-controlled drug release, which might be associated
to a good control of drug concentration and higher efficacy.

Taking into account that optimal cutaneous systems are designed
to deliver drugs from 1 to 7 days, the structural stability of the
obtained matrixes after 3 days of delivery (denoted as MOF@drug_del)
and the evaluation of the residual amount of drug were studied by
XRPD, FTIR, TGA, and N2 sorption measurements. In the MIL-100
materials after drug delivery, the absence of vibrational bands at
around 1697 and 1694 cm–1, characteristic of the
(C=O) groups of AAS and IBU, respectively, confirms the complete
release of both drugs (Figure S13). These
results are in agreement with the TGA, exhibiting a similar composition
to the starting material considering 1% of matrix degradation (Figures S10 and S14, Table S3). The structural
integrity of MIL-100@drug_del in water after 3 days monitored by XRPD
indicates a partial loss of crystallinity, probably due to the creation
of some defects within the matrix or the difference in the water content
(Figure S15). Furthermore, N2 sorption experiments of MIL-100@AAS_del confirm the complete recovery
of the porosity after the delivery of the cargo (Figure S16). In contrast, the porosity of MIL-100 is not completely
recovered after the release of IBU. This discrepancy may find its
origin in a partial amorphization of the framework and may be misleading
because crystallinity might be retained while a part of the solid
is degraded (amorphization, hydrolysis, or residual traces of IBU
that block the access to the porosity).

On the other hand, the
FTIR spectrum of UiO-66@IBU_del shows a
vibrational band at around 1700 cm–1, which could
be assigned to the ν(C=O) groups of IBU or even the BDC
ligand (Figure S13). It is known that the
BDC ligand shows a low solubility in water (25 °C, 1.7 mg·100
mL–1). However, the HPLC measurements confirm that
only 1.65% of the total BDC is released after 24 h in water, ruling
out the presence of the ligand and supporting the presence of residual
traces of drug. TGA indicates that the residual drug contents are
about 9 and 35% for UiO-66@AAS_del and UiO-66@IBU_del, respectively
(Figure S14, Table S3). These results are
in good agreement with the total amount of released drug after 3 days
from the UiO-66 material, as studied by HPLC (96 ± 2% of AAS
and 68 ± 3% of IBU). After drug release, XRPD patterns showed
that the structural stability is maintained, although a partial loss
of crystallinity or disorder into the pores of the matrix is observed
(Figure S15). The presence of residual
drug molecules inside the UiO-66 matrixes might explain the reduction
of the N2 uptake at 77 K after the drug-delivery process
compared to the pristine materials (Figure S16). After the drug delivery, 64% (UiO-66@IBU_del) and 88% (UiO-66@AAS_del)
of the pore volume are recovered, values near to the expected values
of 68 and 96% of the IBU and AAS release, respectively (Table S4).

Finally, for MIL-127, both drugs
are only partially released. In
the case of MIL-127@AAS_del, the amount of remaining drug inside the
pores is rather high, i.e., 53%, deduced from HPLC (Figure S11), IR spectra (see band at ca. 1700 cm–1 on Figure S13), TGA (around 50% of residual
AAS, Figure S14, Table S3), and BET (see
lower surface area in Figure S16) with
only 62% of the pore volume recovered, which is close to the expected
pore volume (84%, Table S4). Similarly,
MIL-127@IBU_del also contains residual IBU but to a much lower extent
than with AAS, i.e., around 18%. This is confirmed by IR spectra (see
band at 1703 cm–1 in Figure S13), TGA, and HPLC (Figure S14, Table S3). As the percentage of residual IBU is here rather low,
the N2 uptake at 77 K after IBU release is higher, although
not totally recovered (74% of the initial pore volume, see Table S4). In both cases, the structural integrity
of the MOF is kept after release, as shown by XRPD patterns (Figure S15). Therefore, one can conclude that
MIL-127 remains stable during the delivery process, which makes this
material interesting for its potential use as cutaneous drug-delivery
system.

3 Conclusions
To gain
further understanding of the drug adsorption and delivery
from MOFs, three rigid MOF architectures with different hydrophilic/hydrophobic
balance have been selected for the encapsulation and release of two
model drugs. The loadings of the hydrophilic aspirin and the hydrophobic
ibuprofen have been performed in the MIL-100, UiO-66, and MIL-127
structures, resulting in six different loaded matrixes. One could
establish that the drug uptake is here governed by the hydrophilic/hydrophobic
balance between cargo and matrix (UiO-66 and MIL-127) and the accessibility
of the drug through the framework (MIL-100 and MIL-127). Their controlled
release under cutaneous conditions follows different kinetics profiles
depending on: (i) the structure of the framework, with either a fast
delivery from the very open structure MIL-100 or a slower drug release
from the narrow 1D pore system of MIL-127 or (ii) the hydrophobic/hydrophilic
nature of the cargo, with a fast (AAS) and slow (IBU) release from
the UiO-66 matrix.

As a whole, all loaded materials fit well
as cutaneous drug-delivery
systems because of their high drug loading and good aqueous stability,
which is associated with drug releases in less than 7 days. These
results highlight the importance on the rational selection of MOFs
and the physicochemical properties of cargoes on the encapsulation
and release process.

4 Experimental Section
All reactants were commercially obtained and used without further
purification. The synthesis of starting materials was performed under
solvothermal or reflux conditions following similar procedures as
previously reported.

4.1 Synthesis of Ethyl Ester
1,3,5-Benzenetricarboxylic
(EE-BTC)
1,3,5-Benzenetricarboxylic acid (H3BTC;
5 g, 2.4 mmol) was dispersed in 100 mL of absolute ethanol. H2SO4 (95%, 2 mL) was added to this suspension, and
the resulting mixture was stirred under reflux for 24 h to give, upon
cooling, a white precipitate, which was filtered off (filter funnel
no. 4) and cleaned with water and ether. 1H NMR (300 MHz,
CDCl3) δ: 8.84 (s, 3H), 4.45 (q, 6H), 1.43 (t, 9H).

4.2 Synthesis of 3,3′,5,5′-Azobenzenetetracarboxylic
Acid (ABTC)53
5-Nitroisophthalic
acid (19 g) was dispersed in 250 mL of distilled water. NaOH (50 g)
was added, and the resulting mixture was heated at 60 °C under
stirring. A pink slurry was thus formed. Subsequently, 100 g of glucose
dissolved in 150 mL of water was slowly added to the previously obtained
pink slurry. The solution turned from yellow to orange and then to
brown. The heating was stopped, and air was bubbled through the solution
overnight at room temperature. The mixture was then cooled with an
ice bath to optimize the amount of precipitate, before recovering
the disodium salt by filtration. The filtrate was then redissolved
in 200 mL of distilled water and then this solution was acidified
to pH = 1 using HCl (37%). This yielded a bright orange precipitate,
which was recovered by filtration and washed with ethanol. 1H NMR (DMSO-d6) δ: 8.62 (6H).

4.3 Synthesis of MIL-100 [Fe3O(H2O)2OH(C9H3O6)2]·nH2O27
FeCl3·6H2O (2.7 g,
10 mmol) and EE-BTC (2.24 g, 6.66 mmol) were dispersed in 50 mL of
H2O. The mixture was placed in a Teflon-lined autoclave
at 130 °C for 3 days. Then, the orange solid was recovered by
filtration and washed with absolute ethanol (3 × 10 mL). The
solid was then suspended in 1 L of EtOH, refluxed under stirring for
3 h, and then the same procedure was carried out in deionized water.
The solid was recovered by filtration. The particle size is ∼460
± 80 nm (polydispersity index (PdI) > 0.3).

4.4 Synthesis of UiO-66 [Zr6O4(OH)4(C8O4H4)6]·nH2O15,54,55
ZrCl4 (0.23 g, 1 mmol)
and terephthalic acid (H2BDC; 0.16 g, 1 mmol) were dispersed
in 3 mL of dimethylformamide (DMF) placed in a Teflon-lined autoclave
and heated at 220 °C for 12 h. The resulting solid was recovered
by filtration. After filtration, activation was carried out by solvent
exchange by suspending 200 mg of solid in 100 mL of DMF under stirring
for 12 h and then in 100 mL of MeOH under stirring for 12 h. The particle
size is ∼240 ± 40 nm (PdI > 0.3).

4.5 Synthesis of MIL-127 [Fe3O(OH)0.88Cl0.12(C16N2O8H6)1.5(H2O)3]·n(H2O)29
Fe(ClO4)3·nH2O (9.9 g, 28 mmol)
and ABTC (5.0 g, 14 mmol) were dispersed in 100
mL of DMF. The mixture was refluxed under stirring at 150 °C
for 20 h. The solid was recovered as a brown crystalline solid by
filtration and washed with EtOH. The solid was then suspended in 1
L of EtOH and refluxed overnight under stirring. Then, the solid was
recovered by filtration. The particle size is ∼2 ± 1 μm
(PdI > 0.3).

4.6 Drug Encapsulation
Ibuprofen or aspirin
was entrapped into the porous solids by suspending the previously
dehydrated powdered MOFs (100 °C/overnight) in 20 mL of a 20
mg·mL–1 drug solution in ethanol at room temperature
under magnetic stirring for 24 h, using 30 mL vessels with magnetic
stirring (300 rpm). In all cases, the MOF/drug ratio was 1:4. The
drug-loaded materials were recovered by filtration (filter funnel
no. 4) and cleaned with 5 mL of ethanol.

The amount of adsorbed
drug was quantified by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and high-performance
liquid chromatography (HPLC). Pristine solids and drug-encapsulated
solids were characterized by X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD), Fourier
transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and N2 sorption
measurements.

For the evaluation of the kinetics of the drug
adsorption within
the MIL-100 and UiO-66, the concentration of the remaining free drug
in the impregnation solution was checked by HPLC at different times
(0.5, 1, 2, 3, 6, 16, 24, and 72 h).

4.7 Drug
Release
Drug-containing material
(5 mg) was placed in 40 mL of deionized water at 37 °C under
bidimensional continuous stirring (80 × 80 rpm). At different
incubation times, 20 mL of supernatant was recovered by centrifugation
(10 500 rpm for 15 min) and replaced with the same volume of
fresh deionized water at 37 °C. This procedure was performed
in triplicate. The amount of released drug was determined by HPLC.
After the drug-delivery process, the samples were characterized by
XRPD, FTIR spectroscopy, TGA, and N2 sorption.

4.8 HPLC Measurement Conditions
The amount
of encapsulated and released drug, as well as the release of the corresponding
organic linker was determined using a reversed-phase HPLC system Waters
Alliance e2695 Separations Module (Waters, Milford, MA), equipped
with a variable-wavelength photodiode array detector Waters 2998 and
controlled by Empower software. SunFire-C18 reverse-phase column (5
μm, 4.6 × 150 mm2, Waters) or Hypersil GOLD
C18 (5 μm, 150 × 4.6 mm2, Thermo Fisher) were
employed. For the quantification of all of the chemical species, isocratic
conditions were used. The flow rate was 0.8 mL·min–1, and the column temperature was fixed at 25 °C. In all cases,
the injection volume was 50 μL.

Different HPLC measurement
conditions were used for the quantification of drugs and ligands:
AAS (85:15 MeOH/buffer solution (0.04 M, pH = 2.5), retention time
(RT) = 5.6 min and absorption maximum λ = 227.9 nm); IBU (85:15
MeOH/buffer solution (0.04 M, pH = 2.5), RT = 4.9 min and λ
= 219.6 nm); H3BTC (50:50 MeOH/buffer solution (0.04 M,
pH = 2.5), RT = 3.3 min and λ = 225 nm); H2BDC (5:95
MeOH/buffer solution (0.04 M, pH = 9), RT = 3.6 min and λ =
240 nm); ABTC (5:95 MeOH/buffer solution (0.04 M, pH = 9), RT = 2.9
min and λ = 225 nm) (SI, Section 1; Figures S1–S5).

4.8.1 Preparation of the Buffer
Solution (0.04
M, pH = 2.5)
NaH2PO4 (2.4 g, 0.02 mol)
and Na2HPO4 (2.84 g, 0.02 mol) were dissolved
in 1 L of Milli-Q water. The pH was then adjusted to 2.5 with H3PO4 (≥85%).

1H NMR spectra
for the characterization of the synthesized ligands were recorded
on an Bruker Avance Instrument (300 MHz). FTIR spectra were recorded
using a Nicolet 6700 FTIR Thermo Scientific spectrometer in the 400–4000
cm–1 region. XRPD patterns were collected in a Siemens
D5000 diffractometer (θ–2θ) using Cu Kα radiation
with a step size of 0.04° (2θ) and 4 s per step in continuous
mode. TGA was performed under oxygen flow (20 mL·min–1) using a PerkinElmer Diamond TGA/DTA STA 6000 running from room
temperature to 600 °C with a scan rate of 2 °C·min–1. N2 isotherms were obtained at 77 K using
a BELSORP-mini (Bel, Japan). Prior to the analysis, approximately
40–60 mg of material was evacuated under vacuum at different
times and temperatures taking into account the decomposition temperature
of AAS (140 °C) and IBU (160 °C); the drug-loaded materials
and the materials obtained after the drug-delivery process were evacuated
at 110 °C for 24 h. HPLC measurements were performed using a
HPLC system Waters Alliance e2695 Separations Module (Waters, Milford,
MA) equipped with a variable-wavelength photodiode array detector
Waters 2998 and controlled by Empower software.

4.9 Computational Section
To estimate
the configuration of the drug molecules in the selected solids, Grand
Canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) calculations were performed at 300 K
with a simulation box large enough to use a cutoff equal to 12.5 Å
with typically 10 × 106 Monte Carlo steps for both
equilibration and production steps. Partial charges have been evaluated
using qEq method (included in Materials Studio software),56 whereas universal force field is considered
for Lennard-Jones interatomic potentials.57

Initial structures for MIL-100, MIL-127, and UiO-66 were obtained
from the literature and then optimized classically.27,28,58 Regarding GCMC calculations, the structure
of the solid was supposed to be rigid with fixed unit cell parameters.
The adsorbed drug molecules were optimized using density functional
theory (DMol3 using PW91 functional and DNP basis set)
calculations and considered in the GCMC calculations as rigid. We
note also that drug coordination to the metal sites was not taken
into consideration.

In complement, from the solid structures,
free volume was calculated
using a method of trial insertions within the entire volume of the
unit cell. A probe size of 0 Å was used to enable us to determine
this total free volume of the unit cell that was not occupied by the
atoms of the framework.59 The maximum saturation
loading for UiO-66 and ibuprofen was determined by dividing the free
volume of the structure by the volume of the IBU molecule (212 Å3 determined using software available in Materials Studio).
In addition, specific surface area can be calculated for each structure
using the approach developed by Düren et al.,59 considering the center of a N2 probe molecule
rolling across the surface (with a diameter equal to 3.681 Å).
