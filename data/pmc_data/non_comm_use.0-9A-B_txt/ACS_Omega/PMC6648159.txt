A promising technique based on the
luminescence with long wavelength
excitation and short wavelength emission (LExL, λex-L > λem) is developed. This LExL is different
from
traditional upconversion luminescence (UCL). The LExL, namely, special
“UCL”, is realized by a xenon light source of a common
spectrofluorometer. In this work, we found that dopamine (DA) has
this LExL phenomenon. The LExL of DA is mainly caused by the excitations
of second-order diffraction light (λex-L/2).
The two-photon absorption properties of DA have been calculated employing
the density functional response theory. The LExL and Stokes luminescence
(SL, λex-S < λem) of DA
both showed static quenching upon the addition of Fe3+.
Dual-mode luminescence methods upon LExL (λex-L/λem at 565/317 nm) and SL (λex-S/λem at 282/317 nm) of DA were applied for the selective
determination of Fe3+. The detection limits are 0.30 and
0.52 μmol L–1 for LExL and SL, respectively.
In addition, their linear ranges for Fe3+ determination
are both from 0.70 to 30 μmol L–1. The LExL
method of DA not only meets the basic determination criteria for Fe3+ but also offers additional advantages in resisting more
interferences and shows satisfactory feasibility performances.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Iron,
an important trace element in human body, is indispensable
on the cell metabolism, enzyme catalysis, and cytotoxicity.1 However, iron overload can break the iron balance
in the body and cause adverse consequences. The massive discharge
of iron-rich industrial wastewater aggravates environmental pollution
and health problems. Dopamine (DA, 3,4-dihydroxyphenethylamine) is
closely related to the normal operation of cardiovascular and hormonal
systems in mammalian animals.2 Some research
results have showed that the interaction between iron ions and DA/DA-derived
neuromelanins highly connect with neurodegenerative diseases.3−5 Therefore, the interaction of Fe3+ with DA and the precise
determination of Fe3+ is of crucial important.6−8 Heretofore, many polydopamine (PDA)- and DA-functionalized materials
were as excellent sensors for detection of Fe3+.9,10 However, these PDA–DA-functionalized materials undergo complicated
and time-consuming modifying processes. Furthermore, excitation wavelengths
of these fluorescent sensors are mostly located in the ultraviolet
region.9−12 As we know, ultraviolet radiation can cause a certain degree of
light damage. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a longer wavelength
excited luminescent method to determine Fe3+ and study
direct interaction between DA and Fe3+.

Generally,
upconversion luminescence (UCL) refers to the luminescence
of emission wavelength shorter than excitation wavelength.13 UCL has been widely applicable in biosensing,
phototherapy, drug delivery, and so forth.14 A laser is usually required as a light source to achieve two- and
multi-photon excitation.13,14 However, Lee et al.
has developed a special “UCL” technique achieved by
a xenon light source on the common spectrofluorometer,15−19 which is also a luminescence method based on the excitation wavelength
longer than the emission wavelength (LExL, λex-L > λem). Usually, the excitation wavelength of
the
special “UCL” is located at double that of Stokes luminescence
(SL: λex-S < λem), that
is λex-L = 2λex-S.
Although the mechanism of the luminescence is controversial,19−23 the special “UCL” technique can be effectively applicable
in spectral characterization and the quantitative determination of
target analytes.24−26 Salinas-Castillo’s team has made use of the
special “UCL” and down-conversion fluorescent properties
of their carbon dots for selective detection of Cu2+ ion.24 In addition, the special “UCL”
method shows an obvious advantage in eliminating interference caused
by Fe3+. Zhang et al. constructed a nanoprobe [nitrogen-doped
carbon dots/gold nanoparticles (NC-dots/AuNPs)] to selectively detect
cysteine with multiple signals: colorimetric, photoluminescence (λex/λem at 400/475 nm), and special “UCL”
(λex/λem at 800/490 nm).25 However, so far, a limited number of LExL/special
“UCL” methods were reported and focused on the graphene/carbon-based
quantum dots.24−26 The exploration of the LExL/special “UCL”
technology needs to be further studied.

In this work, we found
the LExL phenomenon also exists in the organic
small molecule (DA). In addition, we studied the luminescence mechanism
by the fluorescence experiments and time-dependent density functional
theory (DFT). The LExL of DA is mainly caused by the excitations of
second-order diffraction light (λex-L/2).
The LExL and SL of DA could both be used in studying the fluorescence
quenching effect of DA by Fe3+. The schematic diagram of
interaction mechanism of DA with Fe3+ is shown in Scheme 1. The dual-mode “turn-off”
luminescence methods upon the LExL and SL of DA can be applied to
the selective detection of Fe3+. The two methods confirmed
the feasibility in the determination of Fe3+ in the actual
water samples. In addition, the LExL method shows better linear correlation,
test stability, and the lower detection limit.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Spectral
Properties of DA
Fluorescence
information of DA could be obtained by 3D fluorescence spectra (Figure 1). The excitation
peaks of SL are at 220 and 282 nm (Figure 1A). Surprisingly, we found that DA also has
LExL properties. Corresponding excitation wavelengths of LExL are
383, 446, and 565 nm, respectively (Figure 1B). In addition, emission peak positions
are all the same at 317 nm.

Figure 1 (A) SL and (B) LExL of 3D fluorescence spectra
of DA. The contour
intervals both were 20 nm. The concentration of DA was 10 μmol
L–1.

Both the LExL and SL of DA show excitation-independent luminescent
properties (Figure S1). In addition, under
excitation at 565 and 446 nm for LExL and 282 and 220 nm for SL and
the strongest fluorescence emission at 317 nm are obtained. The excitation
wavelengths of LExL are located at about twofold that of SL. The phenomena
indicate that LExL of DA contains the luminescence by the excitation
of second-order diffraction light (565/2 nm, 446/2 nm).

Some
reports attributed the special “UCL” (λex-L = 2λex-S) of graphene/carbon-based
quantum dots to the multiphoton active process from their own structures.15−19 Although these explanations are not completely sufficient, one can
realize that this special “UCL” arises from the structures
of fluorophores. In view of this point, we speculate that the LExL
of DA may be related to its two-photon absorption (TPA) characteristic.
TPA cross sections (σTPA) can be used in estimating
the ability of the fluorophores absorbing two photons.27 To explore the possibility, we calculated TPA
properties of DA by response theory at the default time-dependent
DFT level at the B3LYP and CAM-B3LYP functional with the 6-31G(d)
basis set in Dalton 2013 package. In this work, the pH of DA solution
is about 5.50, and the protonated DA state is more reasonable (DA,
pKa1 = 9.0).28 Theoretical calculation results (optimized conformers, TPA properties,
etc.) of protonated DA are shown in the Supporting Information. The lowest energy conformers of protonated DA
are illustrated in Scheme S1. Its wavelengths
of bigger σTPA are at 446, 383, and 353 nm as obtained
by B3LYP functional and at 424, 367, and 317 nm as calculated by CAM-B3LYP
functional, respectively.

To verify that the LExL excited by
565 nm light is not entirely
the excitation of second-order diffraction light (λex-L/2), we put a 500 nm longpass filter in the excitation channel (Figure S2). Although most LExL of DA was eliminated,
there is still a weak emission peak at about 310 nm. The results indicate
that besides the excitation of second-order diffraction light (λex-L/2: 565/2 nm, 446/2 nm, 383/2 nm), the LExL of DA
(λex-L at 565, 446, and 383 nm) may be caused
by other luminescence.

The influence of the pH on the fluorescence
of DA was studied.
The 565 nm is selected as the excitation wavelength of LExL for further
researches because of the relatively lower excitation energy and stronger
fluorescence intensities than excited by 383 nm or 446 nm lights.
Correspondingly, the excitation wavelength of SL is chosen to be 282
nm. We measured the intensities of LExL and SL of DA under different
pH conditions. The results are shown in Figure 2A. The fluorescence intensities of LExL and
SL of DA at 317 nm both display pH-dependent properties. That is,
the fluorescent intensities of DA are high and nearly constant when
pH < 5.0, while the intensities are relatively weak at pH 10 or
higher. In addition, the emission intensity of DA decreases linearly
within the pH range of 5.0–10.0. The pH-dependent performance
of LExL and SL of DA may be due to the protonation or deprotonation
and the oxidation of DA and formation of PDA.3,28 To
verify this point, the UV–vis spectra of DA under different
pH were investigated (Figure 2B). The absorption peaks of DA at 280 nm are assigned to the
π–π* transition of sp2 domains in aromatic
ring of DA. As the pH value increases from 2.0 to 5.0, the absorbance
of DA is decreased (Figure 2B, inset). Oppositely, in this pH range, the strongest fluorescence
emission of DA is obtained (Figure 2A), which indicates that low pH or higher protonation
is favorable for the luminescence of DA. However, along with the increase
of pH value in the range of 6.0–8.0, the absorption peaks show
a gradual bathochromic-shift from 280 to 286 nm and the absorbencies
rise, which are attributed to the different degree of deprotonation
of DA.28 When the pH value is larger than
10, the absorption peaks of DA at 280 nm show significant red shifts
accompanied by the greatly enhanced intensity, and a new wide absorption
band arises at 400–600 nm, demonstrating the formation of PDA.3,29

nm) and SL (λex-S = 282 nm) of DA. (B) UV–vis
spectra of DA under different pH. Insets: the detailed UV–vis
spectra in different pH ranges. Curves: 1, DA, 2–11, DA in

2.2 Fluorescence Quenching
of DA by Fe3+
The spectra of the LExL and SL of
DA in the various concentrations
of Fe3+ were monitored (Figure 3A,B). The obvious quenching effects of the
LExL and SL of DA are both obtained after the addition of Fe3+. In view of the pH effect on the luminescence properties of DA,
the pH of DA solution containing various concentrations of Fe3+ were also measured. The pH values decrease from 5.54 to
4.50 with the increase of Fe3+ concentrations from 0.7
to 100 μmol L–1. However, in this pH range,
the intensities of LExL and SL of DA are both the maximum value and
almost remained unchanged (Figure 2A). Therefore, the quenching effects of LExL and SL
should be induced by the interaction of DA with Fe3+ rather
than pH.

Figure 3 Emission spectra of (A) LExL (λex-L = 565
nm) and (B) SL (λex-S = 282 nm) of DA (10
μmol L–1) with increasing Fe3+ concentration.
The Fe3+ concentrations from 1 to 13 are 0, 0.70, 3.0,
5.0, 7.0, 9.0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 70, and 100 μmol L–1, respectively.

Generally, static and
dynamic quenching is differentiated depending
on the change in fluorescence quenching efficiency at different temperatures.30 According to the Stern–Volmer equation: I0/If = 1 + KQ[Q], the quenching curves of LExL and SL of
the system are plotted at different temperatures of 288, 298, and
308 K (Figure S3). Here, I0 and If are the fluorescence
intensities of DA in the absence and presence of quencher (Fe3+), respectively. KQ is the quenching
constant. [Q] is the concentration of quencher (Fe3+).
The linear plots suggest a sole static or dynamic quenching.30 In addition, the corresponding quenching parameters
of the system are showed in Table S1. The
quenching constants for SL and LExL of DA were 3.56 × 105 and 3.48 × 105 L mol–1 at
288 K, 2.43 × 105 and 2.38 × 105 L
mol–1 at 298 K, and 2.10 × 105 and
1.97 × 105 L mol–1 at 308 K, respectively.
With increasing temperature, the quenching constants show apparent
decreases. Therefore, it can be speculated that there is a static
quenching process when Fe3+ interacts with DA.

To
further verify the quenching mechanism, the fluorescence decay
curves were recorded at 280 nm excitation.

The fluorescence
lifetimes were obtained by using the single exponential
fitting (Figure S4). The lifetimes of DA
and DA–Fe3+ complexes are calculated to be 0.84
ns (χ2 = 0.909) and 0.78 ns (χ2 =
1.014), respectively. Their fluorescence lifetimes are almost unchanged,
which also further demonstrate that the fluorescence quenching of
DA caused by Fe3+ is a static quenching process.11

2.3 Interaction of DA with
Fe3+
To explore the interaction between DA and
Fe3+, the absorption
spectra of DA in the presence of various concentrations of Fe3+ were investigated (Figure 4). Water is selected as the reference solution. Inset
of Figure 4 shows that
the absorption band of Fe3+ has some overlapping with that
of DA, but the absorbance at 280 nm of DA–Fe3+ is
not the simple superposition of that of Fe3+ and DA, suggesting
that the interaction exists between DA and Fe3+. The absorption
profiles of the DA–Fe3+ system are somewhat similar
to those of DA at different pH (see Figure 2B). Differently, a shoulder peak of 310 nm
gradually grows upon adding of Fe3+ until it merges with
the peak of 280 nm. The change of the absorption peak may be attributed
to the covalent conjugating between Fe3+ with catechol
group of DA. In addition, the oxidation of DA can also lead to the
emergence of absorption peak in ultraviolet region.3 Thus, we believe that the absorption at 310 nm may be partly
the result of the oxidation of DA induced by Fe3+. The
broad absorption band of the DA–Fe3+ system appearing
around 380–600 nm partly overlaps with the 400–600 nm
absorption band of DA at high pH (Figure 2B). In addition, the maximum peak position
of the DA–Fe3+ is at about 470 nm, distinguishing
it from that of DA at 440 nm in high pH condition. In addition, the
absorption peak of PDA–Fe3+ is around 490 nm.4,31 Therefore, the broad absorption peak of 380–600 nm is presumably
attributed to the formation of PDA–Fe3+ complexes.

absorption spectra of the system. Conditions: (1)
Fe3+: 5.0 μmol L–1, (2) DA: 10
μmol L–1, and (3–9) DA (10 μmol
L–1) with various concentrations of Fe3+: 0.70, 3.0, 5.0, 7.0, 10, 20, and 30 μmol L–1. Inset: the detailed UV–vis absorption spectra of Fe3+ (blue curve), DA (black curve), and DA–Fe3+ (red curve) against water. Conditions: DA: 10 μmol L–1, Fe3+: 5.0 μmol L–1.

We monitored the Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR)
spectra of
DA and DA–Fe3+ to obtain the combination information
of DA–Fe3+ complexes (see Figure S5). The feature peaks of DA disappeared after reacting with
Fe3+, including 1504 cm–1 (NH2 scissoring vibration), 1341 cm–1 (CH2 bending vibration), 1322 cm–1 (C–O–H
asymmetry bending vibration), and 1187 cm–1 (C–O
symmetry vibration). The peak of DA–Fe3+ around
1634 cm–1 widened compared with that of DA, indicating
the existence of C=C stretching vibration assigned to the indole
derivatives.32 These results all verified
the oxidation and intramolecular cyclization of DA and the subsequent
formations of PDA–Fe3+.3,32

To get further insights into the interaction of DA and Fe3+, we added the strong chelating agent ethylenediaminetetraacetic
acid (EDTA) to the DA–Fe3+ system. As shown in Figure S6, EDTA has little effect on the fluorescent
properties of the LExL and SL of DA. However, the fluorescence of
the DA–Fe3+ system is regenerated after adding EDTA.
The fluorescence recovery indicates that the chelation between EDTA
and Fe3+ weakens the interaction of Fe3+ with
DA and induces the dissociation of Fe3+ from DA.

Another interesting phenomenon is noted in the cyclic processes
of adding Fe3+ and EDTA into the DA (Figure 5). The alternative addition of Fe3+ and EDTA enabled the fluorescence intensity of DA at 317 nm to alternate
between on and off states several times. At first, the addition of
EDTA into the DA–Fe3+ solution led to about 74%
recovery rate of the fluorescence. The incomplete recovery in the
fluorescence intensity indicates there are some changes in the existence
forms of DA after the reaction with Fe3+. Then, the quenching
effect caused by Fe3+ and the fluorescence recoveries by
EDTA on LExL and SL of DA both become gradually weaker. After several
cycles, the addition of EDTA has little influence on the fluorescence
intensities of the system. The reason may lie in that DA gradually
becomes into other forms induced by Fe3+. According to
the FT-IR, UV spectra analysis, the multiple interaction modes between
DA and Fe3+ may include the complexation of DA with Fe3+, oxidation of DA, and gradual formations of PDA–Fe3+.3 The chelation between EDTA
and Fe3+ can induce the dissociation of Fe3+ from DA and weaken the complexation of Fe3+ with DA;
thus, the partial fluorescence of DA is restored. After several cycles,
DA partly gradually oxidizes and polymerizes into PDA (Figure S6, gray curve), and finally EDTA cannot
restore the fluorescence of residual DA (Figure S6, magenta curve). The specific reaction processes need to
be studied in detail in the future.

565 nm, blue) and SL (λex-S at 282 nm, black)
of DA (10 μmol L–1) at 317 nm between the
ON and OFF states with the alternate addition of 30 μmol L–1 Fe3+ and 50 μmol L–1 EDTA.

2.4 Detection
of Fe3+
Here,
10 μmol L–1 DA is chosen for Fe3+ detection. In this case, DA has an appropriate fluorescence intensity.
The intensities of LExL and SL both show the strongest quenching within
3 min after adding Fe3+ to DA solution (Figure S7). As shown in Figure 6A,B, there are good linear correlations between (I0 – I)/I0 and Fe3+ concentration ranging from 0.70
to 30 μmol L–1 for LExL (R2 = 0.9983) and SL (R2 = 0.9833).
The limits of detection (LODs) are 0.30 and 0.52 μmol L–1 for LExL and SL, respectively. LOD was calculated
according to 3S/N, where S represents the standard deviation of 11
measurements of 10 μmol L–1 DA and N is the
slope of the calibration curve. The linear correlation and detection
limit of the LExL-based method are superior to those of the SL-based
method. The LODs of two methods are both lower than the maximum permitted
Fe3+ content (5.4 μmol L–1) in
drinking water of state standard.33 And
what is more, compared with some methods (Table S2), our strategies could avoid undergoing complicated and
time-consuming modifying processes. However, the sensitivity of the
proposed method needs to be further improved.

fluorescence quenching value (I0 – I)/I0 at 317 nm of (A) LExL
(λex-L = 565
nm) and (B) SL (λex-S = 282 nm) of DA (10
μmol L–1) upon addition of different concentrations
of Fe3+ (0.70, 5.0, 10, 20, and 30 μmol L–1).

2.5 Selectivity
and Interference Study
To evaluate the anti-interference
ability and selectivity of the
proposed methods, the response signals of the LExL and SL of DA to
a variety of metal cations without Fe3+ and the mixture
of Fe3+ with other various metal ions were monitored (Figure 7). Al3+ ion, in all tested ions except for Fe3+, is the other
one with a more distinguishable quenching effect on the luminescence
signal of DA. The results may be attributed to the high affinity of
DA for trivalent metal ions.9 However,
the quenching efficiency of Al3+ is only about a quarter
of that of Fe3+, which indicates that the charge density
of metal ions is not really the main cause of the quenching process
in this work. In addition, the fluorescence intensity changes of DA
caused by other tested metal ions are less than 10 percent. In addition,
the mixture of various metal ions has little inhibitation to the fluorescence
quenching of DA induced by Fe3+. These results illustrate
that the dual-mode DA-based fluorescence method possesses high selectivity
for the detection of Fe3+. Furthermore, Ca2+, Cu2+, Hg2+, Al3+, Ba2+, Mg2+, Zn2+, Pb2+, Cr3+, Cd2+, Ni2+, and Fe2+ ion have
similar enhancement or quenching effect on LExL and SL of DA. However,
Pb2+ and Cd2+ ions have higher fluorescence
enhancements for SL than LExL of DA. Additionally, Ag+,
K+, Na+, Mn2+, and Co2+ ions can enhance the intensities of the SL of DA and, alternatively,
reduce those of the LExL of DA. The changes in their intensity of
the SL are bigger than those of the LExL. Therefore, LExL of DA may
be a better choice when Fe3+ coexists with Pb2+, Cd2+, Ag+, K+, Na+,
Mn2+, or Co2+ ions.

metal ions and the mixture of Fe3+ with other various metal
ions; gray and blue columns represent

respectively. Conditions: DA: 10 μmol L–1,

K+, Hg2+, Na+, Al3+, Mn2+, Ba2+, Mg2+, Zn2+, Pb2+, Co2+, Cr3+, Cd2+, Ni2+, Fe2+: 30 μmol L–1.

2.6 Performance
in Real Samples Analysis
To demonstrate the feasibility of
the dual-mode luminescence of DA
for the Fe3+ detection, the standard addition method was
employed for testing. In addition, the recovery experiments of Fe3+ were carried out in the actual water samples of Daming Lake
water (pH = 7.04) and tap water (pH = 6.89) samples in Ji’nan
of Shandong Province. The pH of the spiked samples of Daming Lake
water and tap water samples are in the range of 6.86–6.88 and
6.75–6.79, respectively. During the changes of pH values within
0.20, in this pH range, the intensities of LExL and SL of DA are almost
unchanged (Figure 2A); thus, we can exclude the influence of pH change on sample determination.
The detection results are summarized in Table S3. The recoveries of 89.1–106.0% are obtained for Daming
Lake water. For the tap water sample, the recovery rates are between
90.6 and 108.2%. Meanwhile, the contents of Fe3+ in the
tap water sample monitored by the LExL and SL of DA are approximately
the same. The relative standard deviations of LExL (0.19–5.0%)
are almost lower than those of SL (0.50–8.3%) in the same measurement,
indicating a better test stability of LExL. These results demonstrate
that the dual-mode luminescence of DA exhibits cheerful prospects
in practical application for monitoring Fe3+.

3 Conclusions
In summary, we studied the luminescence
characteristic of LExL
of DA through fluorescence measurements using a common spectrofluorometer
with a xenon-lamp light source and the calculation employing the density
functional response theory. The LExL of DA is mainly caused by the
excitations of second-order diffraction light (λex-L/2). The dual-mode luminescence methods based on LExL and SL of DA
were adopted for studying the interaction of DA with Fe3+ and the selective determination of Fe3+. The proposed
two methods for the detection of Fe3+ are quick (2–3
min) and simple in design without complex synthesis processes, and
the results of dual signal responses are more reliable. The LExL method
is proved to be a sensitive and selective method for the determination
of Fe3+. Comparing with SL method, the LExL method can
resist more interferences. The method may be a better choice when
Fe3+ coexists with Pb2+, Cd2+, Ag+, K+, Na+, Mn2+, or Co2+ ions. In addition, the LExL of DA shows better linear correlation,
test stability, and lower detection limit. We hope that the LExL/special
“UCL” method enables promising applications in spectral
characterization and the quantitative determination of target analytes.

Control (Beijing, China). Metal cations of Fe3+, Na+, K+, Ag+, Hg2+, Cd2+, Co2+, Cu2+, Cr3+, Mn2+, Ba2+, Zn2+, Ni2+, Mg2+, Ca2+, Pb2+, Al3+, and Fe2+ were derived from the water solution made up of FeCl3, NaCl, KCl, AgNO3, Hg(NO3)2, CdCl2, CoCl2, CuSO4, CrCl3, MnCl2, BaCl2, ZnSO4, NiCl2, Mg(NO3)2, CaCl2, PbCl2, AlCl3, and FeCl2, respectively. These inorganic salts
(AR) were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd (Shanghai,
China). Ultrapure water (18.25 MΩ cm) was used throughout in
this work.

4.2 Apparatus
Three-dimensional
(3D)
fluorescence spectra and two-dimensional (2D) fluorescence measurements
were conducted by an F-7000 spectrofluorimeter (Hitachi, Japan). The
fluorescence experiment with a 500 nm longpass filter was conducted
on FluoroMax-4 spectrofluorimeter (HORIBA, Japan). The fluorescence
lifetime decay was monitored on an Edinburgh Instruments FLS920 luminescence
spectrometer equipped with a 280 nm laser as excitation light source.
UV–vis absorption spectra were tested on a TU-1901 spectrophotometer
(Beijing Purkinje General Instrument Co., Ltd.). The measurements
of FT-IR spectra were on an Alpha-T spectrophotometer (Bruker, Germany).
The operation of freeze drying was carried out on an FDU-1200 freeze
dryer (Eyela, Japan). The measurement of pH values was conducted with
a pHS-3C acidity meter (Leici, China).

4.3 Fluorescence
Measurements
For the
3D fluorescence spectra, the photomultiplier (PMT) voltages were set
as 700 V (λex-L/λem = 355–600
nm/280–400 nm) for LExL and 400 V (λex-S/λem = 200–308 nm/200–550 nm) for
SL, respectively. The scanning speed was 12 000 nm/min. The
2D fluorescence test parameters were set as follows: excitation and
emission slit widths, 10 nm; scan speed, 240 nm/min; PMT voltages,
700 V for LExL and 400 V for SL, respectively. Their positions of
emission peaks are both at 317 nm. The longpass filter of 500 nm was
placed in the excitation channel to eliminate the second-order diffraction
light at 282 (565/2) nm from light source. The excitation and emission
slits of the FluoroMax-4 spectrofluorimeter are 7 nm and the integration
time is 0.10 s. The quartz cuvette (1 cm × 1 cm) was used. The
fluorescent signal values of DA are expressed as IL0 and IS0 for LExL and SL,
respectively.

4.4 Fluorescence Lifetime
For all the
samples, the excitation wavelengths of fluorescence lifetime tests
were set at 280 nm. The test results were fitted with a single exponential
function, and the fitting quality is evaluated by the value of χ2.

4.5 FT-IR Spectra
The mixture solution
of DA (500 μL 1.0 mmol L–1) and Fe3+ (1.5 mL 10 mmol L–1) in a 5 mL beaker was freeze-dried
for 72 h at −40 °C to obtain solid products. In addition,
the KBr pressed pellet method was conducted for the FT-IR spectrum
measurement.

4.6 Detection of Fe3+
Appropriate
amounts of Fe3+ were added into 1.0 mL of DA solution (0.10
mmol L–1). The mixture was diluted to 10 mL with
water and fully mixed. Fluorescence measurements were conducted after
incubation of 2 min. IL and IS are the signal intensities of LExL and SL for the DA–Fe3+ system, respectively. To improve the accuracy for the determination
of Fe3+, the test results were carried out in triplicate.

4.7 Real Water Sample Assays
Real water
samples were taken from the Daming Lake and tap water in Ji’nan
of Shandong province, China. The water of the Daming Lake was filtered
via a qualitative filter paper to get rid of insoluble impurities.
The standard addition method was adopted to test the application feasibility
of the dual-mode luminescence methods.
