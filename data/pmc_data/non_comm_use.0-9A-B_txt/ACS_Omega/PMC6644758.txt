Morphology, dimension, size, and
surface chemistry of gold nanoparticles
are critically important in determining their optical, catalytic,
and photothermal properties. Although many techniques have been developed
to synthesize various gold nanostructures, complicated and multistep
procedures are required to generate three-dimensional, dendritic gold
nanostructures. Here, we present a simple method to synthesize highly
branched gold nanodendrites through the well-controlled reduction
of gold ions complexed with a catechol-grafted polymer. Dextran grafted
with catechols guides the morphological evolution as a polymeric ligand
to generate dendritic gold structures through the interconnection
of the spherical gold nanoparticles. The reduction kinetics, which
is critical for morphological changes, is controllable using dimethylacetamide,
which can decrease the metal–ligand dissociation and gold ion
diffusivity. This study suggests that mussel-inspired polymer chemistry
provides a simple one-pot synthetic route to colloidal gold nanodendrites
that are potentially applicable to biosensing and catalysis.

1 Introduction
Gold
nanoparticles (AuNPs) have received much attention due to
their wide range of potential applications, including bioimaging,
sensing, therapeutics, drug and gene deliveries, and catalysis.1−6 The applicability of AuNPs depends upon the optical, electronic,
and chemical properties, which are strongly correlated with particle
size, shape, and surface chemistry.7−13 In particular, dendritic gold nanostructures have been reported
to exhibit enhanced surface-enhanced Raman scattering sensitivity
and catalytic activities due to increasing local electric field and
large surface-to-volume ratio.14−17 Various reducing and capping agents have been studied
to induce the formation of AuNPs using gold ion precursors (e.g.,
chloroauric acid (HAuCl4)). It is now well established
that a critical factor in determining the size and shape of AuNPs
is the controlled balance of competitive nucleation and growth rates
on specific crystalline facets.18−20 The balance is profoundly affected
by the strength of metal–ligand interactions and the diffusivity
of ionic precursors.

Several phenolic compounds (e.g., hydroquinone,
tannin, and catechol)
can serve as reducing agents for noble metal precursors.3,21−27 Catechol has a reduction potential (Eo) of about 530 mV versus reversible hydrogen electrode at a neutral
pH, and this modest reduction power is a crucial feature of catechol
as an antioxidant in diverse biological processes.28 In particular, catechol has an exceptional binding affinity
to various metallic substrates via metal–catechol complexation.29,30 In the presence of tetrachloroauric ions (AuCl4–), catechol can undergo rapid oxidative conversion into catecholquinone
through the transfer of two electrons to the ionic precursor.22−24 However, a previous study showed that the controlled synthesis of
AuNPs using catechol is very challenging in water due to the very
fast reduction kinetics, resulting in irregular, relatively large
particles.22 Hence, the electron transfer
kinetics needs to be reduced to modulate the morphology of gold nanostructures
when catechol is used as a reducing agent while its reduction potential
should be maintained.

The use of an organic solvent as a reaction
medium can be a solution
for this issue. As an instance, N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) could serve as a reductive medium for the
synthesis of AuNPs at elevated temperatures, 150–160 °C,
with an excess amount of poly(vinyl pyrrolidone) (PVP) as a stabilizer.31 The nucleation and growth of AuNPs are influenced
by the presence of water, which can facilitate the dissociation of
AuCl4–. As a result, the amount of water
added to DMF plays a crucial role in determining the size and morphology
of the synthesized AuNPs. The use of nonaqueous reaction media could
be advantageous when catechol serves as a reducing ligand owing to
the lower relative permittivity of media and the high solubility of
catechol in a broad range of organic solvents. The chemical diversity
of the side functional groups of catechol also provides a unique opportunity
for controlling the reduction kinetics of gold ion precursors. Another
useful property of catechol as a ligand is that it can be easily introduced
to a polymeric backbone as a pendant group, as already implemented
using various polymeric materials for bioadhesive and mineralization
applications.24,29,32−34 Catechol-grafted polymers could lead to distinctive
morphologies of AuNPs because the reduction sites of gold ion precursors
are confined by the motion of the polymer chain and affected by the
grafting density of catechol along the backbone.36 This situation is very much different from that of conventional
polymeric stabilizers, such as PVP and poly(vinyl alcohol), where
the nucleation and growth of AuNPs are mainly determined by the diffusional
collisions of gold ion precursors with reducing agents in the bulk
phase. Polymeric stabilizers are subsequently adsorbed to the surface
of the synthesized AuNPs for interfacial stabilization, which can
result in the formation of complex gold nanostructures. Although polymers
and surfactants have been utilized for the templated growth of branched
and dendritic gold nanostructures, their synthetic routes are complicated,
or the final morphologies are limited to only short-armed “urchin-like”
structures.37−39 Recently, the DNA-templated synthesis of branched
gold nanostructures for photothermal applications was suggested, but
their size and structural variation were also very limited.40 Therefore, a simple and fast synthetic method
is still desirable for the generation of more diverse dendritic AuNPs
and even more complicated gold architectures for practical applications.

In this work, we present a one-pot synthesis of highly branched
gold nanodendrites using a catechol-grafted dextran as a reducing
polymeric ligand to control the morphogenesis of gold nanostructures
(Figure 1). Dextran
is a well-known polymer template because it exhibits excellent antifouling
performances for biological applications.41−49 For instance, dextran-coated supermagnetic iron oxide (e.g., FeriDEX)
has been widely used for magnetic resonance imaging,41−44 targeted imaging,45 cell tracking,46,47 and for both drug and nucleic acid deliveries.48,49 Catechol grafted to the dextran backbone was coordinated with AuCl4– through ligand exchange. The decomposition kinetics
of the Au ion–catechol complex into metallic nanostructures
was controlled using a mixed solvent of dimethylacetamide (DMA) and
water at different volumetric ratios to change the relative permittivity
of the reaction medium. The concentration of catechol-grafted dextran
and its mixture with free catechol was controlled to generate interconnected
gold nanostructures.

2 Results and Discussion
The reduction of AuCl4– into AuNPs
can be easily performed using various reducing agents (e.g., sodium
borohydride, quinones, ascorbic acid, etc.) as AuCl4– has a relatively low reduction potential.50 Accordingly, catechol can also spontaneously
transfer two electrons to AuCl4– with
the simultaneous oxidation of catechol to catecholquinone, as previously
demonstrated.22−24,28 The conversion of catechol
to quinone can be easily monitored by the spectral changes in the
UV range. For instance, free pyrocatechol had an absorption peak around
280 nm, but the absorption peak was shifted to ∼290 nm with
the increased intensity as catechol was oxidized to catecholquinone
(Figure 2a). Other
catechol derivatives, such as 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DHPA),
4-tert-butylcatechol, and dopamine, also showed a
similar spectral shift via oxidation (Figure S1). Before synthesizing gold nanostructures using a catechol-grafted
polymer template, we first examined the reduction of AuCl4– into solid AuNPs using pyrocatechol as a reducing
agent with deionized water as a medium. When pyrocatechols were mixed
with AuCl4–, during the first 5 min of
incubation at 90 °C, the catecholquinone peak around 275 nm was
dramatically increased, while a new absorption shoulder with a peak
at 326 nm was generated from the metal-to-ligand (σ*−π)
charge transfer (MLCT) transition of the tetrachloroauric ion (AuCl4–). The MLCT peak is originally located
around 280 nm, being overlapped with the catecholquinone peak. As
the catechol oxidation released free hydrogen ions to the medium,
lowering the medium pH, the MLCT peak was red-shifted.51 Pyrocatechol can be coordinated with metal ions
at room temperature, performing ligand exchange with a characteristic
peak around 400 nm corresponding to the ligand-exchanged intermediate
complexes of catecholquinone and Au1+ ion (Figure 2b,c). The Au–catecholquinone
complex was transiently generated and then reduced to solid AuNPs.22 The generated AuNPs were quickly aggregated
into large, irregular-shaped particulates having a diameter of around
100 nm (Figure 2d).
After 5 min, there was no significant change in the absorption intensity
of the Au–catecholquinone complex, whereas the catecholquinone
peak continued to be increased. As a result, a thicker polymeric layer,
presumably generated by catechol condensation, was formed on the surface
of AuNPs, as indicated in Figure 2d. At room temperature, the reaction was quite slow,
but the tendency was the same as at 90 °C (Figure S2).

in 1 mM NaOH for 10 min. UV–vis absorption spectra ((b) inset:

electron microscopy (TEM) images (d) of 0.4 mM HAuCl4 reacted
with 2 mM pyrocatechol at 90 °C in water at various reaction
times.

The metal-to-ligand interaction
is fundamentally the electrostatic
force, which is influenced by the relative permittivity of the medium
according to Coulomb’s law. Accordingly, the relative permittivity
of reaction media can significantly affect the dissociation and reduction
kinetics of the gold precursors. In our work, the dissociation of
the gold precursors was monitored by the characteristic absorption
peak of the MLCT transitions of AuCl4– in a mixed medium of DMA and water with different ratios (Figure 3). In deionized water,
the ionic precursor solution (pH 3.5) has a maximum peak of absorption
around 293 nm, corresponding to the unresolved MLCT transition. As
the volume fraction of DMA increased, the MLCT transition peak was
gradually red-shifted, and the absorptivity was increased. The increased
interaction between Au3+ and Cl– by DMA
can explain the red-shift of the MLCT peak because DMA has a relatively
lower relative permittivity (e.g., 37.8) compared to that of water
(80.4). Therefore, DMA can suppress the dissociation of AuCl4–. The same phenomena were observed for HAuCl4 in DMF and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) (Figure S3).

Figure 3 UV–vis absorption spectra (a) and the maximum absorbance
and the corresponding wavelength (b) of 0.4 mM HAuCl4 in
the mixtures of water and DMA.

The suppression effect was very strong: when AuCl4– was mixed with pyrocatechol in DMA, no spectral
change
was observed even at 90 °C, indicating no reduction of gold precursors
into solid nanoparticles (Figure S4a).
The reduction of AuCl4– was surprisingly
inhibited in DMA even when sodium borohydride (Eo = −1.24 V) was employed as a reducing agent (Figure S4b). The results indicate that the inhibition
was not caused merely by the insufficient reduction potential of pyrocatechol
in DMA. The increased electrostatic association of AuCl4–, created by the low relative permittivity of
DMA, efficiently suppresses the dissociation of the metal ion from
the ligands. Water has a very high relative permittivity, intermediate
dipole moment (1.85 D), and viscosity (1.02 cP at 25 °C). Because
of the higher relative permittivity of water than that of DMA (37.8),
AuCl4– can be more readily dissociated
in water and interact with catechols effectively. As a result, uncontrolled
rapid nucleation and growth of AuNPs occurred in water.22 In DMA, which has a high dipole moment (3.86
D), the aggregation of AuNPs was efficiently prevented because the
gold–chloride complex was effectively stabilized. During the
formation of AuNPs, the competition between particle nucleation and
growth can also be partially controlled by diffusion. In a low-viscosity
solution, the diffusion is fast, and the reduced Au species can migrate
to the surface of nuclei before they form a new nucleus, resulting
in a wide size range of AuNPs because of a different nucleation and
growth history. However, in the more viscous DMA (1.96 cP at 25 °C),
relatively uniform AuNPs were synthesized because of the relatively
lower diffusivity of reduced Au species. Therefore, we concluded that
neither DMA nor water could make a good medium for the reduction of
gold precursor ions. In water, the reduction kinetics is too fast
to be controlled by the experimental parameters, whereas the metal–ligand
dissociation does not happen efficiently in DMA.

We prepared
a mixture of DMA and water to control the relative
permittivity, which could make a good reaction medium for the catechol-mediated
synthesis of gold nanostructures. The addition of 15 vol % water to
DMA reduced the AuCl4– peak at 326 nm
(Figure 4a–c).
This change indicates that water facilitated the reduction of Au3+ to Au1+ and Au0 through the electron
transfer from catechols, whereas Cl– ligands were
exchanged with catechol. The catecholquinone/Au1+ complexes
were eventually reduced to AuNPs as evidenced by the increased surface
plasmon resonance (SPR) peak at 550 nm. The apparent color of the
obtained samples gradually turned from colorless to pink, revealing
the formation of AuNPs. Accordingly, the MLCT peak at 326 nm decreased,
whereas the SPR peak increased over time. Figure 4d shows the variation of the size and shape
of AuNPs synthesized with pyrocatechol in an 85:15 (v/v) mixture of
DMA and water for 4, 15, and 30 min. At the early stage of Au ion
reduction (4 min), small nanoparticles of about 5 nm in diameter were
aggregated into about 20 nm AuNPs. The increased size and density
of spherical AuNPs were observed in the early stage of the reaction,
and finally, polyhedral AuNPs with >250 nm in diameter were generated
in 30 min. When the amount of water was increased to 50 vol %, the
AuCl4– peak was not observed because
the Cl– ligand might be rapidly replaced with catechol,
and the quinone peak was raised with increased absorbance in the range
of 300–400 nm (Figure S5). The catecholquinone/Au1+ complex peak was detected within 30 s and then decreased
continuously while the SPR peak was generated.

of DMA and water at 90 °C.

Next, we chemically grafted dopamine to the backbone of dextran
via urethane linkage (denoted “dextran-g-ct”)
and used dextran-g-ct as a polymeric template with
a reducing power for the synthesis and steric stabilization of gold
nanostructures. The hydroxyl groups of dextran were activated with
1,1′-carbonyldiimidazole (CDI), and then the active intermediates
were reacted with the primary amine groups of dopamine (Figure S6a). The presence of the catechol moiety
grafted to the backbone of dextran was confirmed using 1H NMR spectrum (Figure S6b). The 1H NMR chemical shifts in DMSO-d6 were assigned as follows: 2.5–3.0 ppm for dopamine linked
to dextran (t, −CH2CH2−), 3.0–3.8 and 4.3–5.0 ppm for dextran, and
6.4–6.75 ppm for catechol. The substitution degree of the catechol
moiety was about 5.9 mol % determined from the 1H NMR spectrum,
calculated using the glucose peak of dextran and the benzene peak
of catechol. Light absorption at 280 nm from catechol also indicated
the successful conjugation of catechol to dextran (Figure S6c). In the preliminary study, we synthesized a higher
catechol-grafting density of ∼10 mol %, which is more reactive
to a large number of gold ions per the polymer chain. However, even
during the storage at 4 °C, it quickly caused an insolubility
problem due to π–π interaction, causing the reproducibility
problem.32,35 To avoid the polymerization of catechol
on the dextran, we decreased the grafting density to 5.9 mol % and
confirmed that no insoluble aggregates were generated for more than
a few months. We also chose a low-molecular-weight dextran, 6 kDa,
because it can be readily dissolved in the reaction media used in
this work.

To examine the morphological control of gold nanostructures
using
dextran-g-ct, we used different concentrations of
dextran-g-ct to synthesize gold nanostructures. Spherical
AuNPs with an average diameter of 7.2 ± 1.1 nm were synthesized
at a high concentration of dextran-g-ct that contains
2 mM of catechol moiety grafted to the dextran backbone (Figures 5a and S7). The catechol moiety of dextran-g-ct can reduce gold ions to solid AuNPs that were sterically stabilized
by dextran-g-ct adsorbed on the surface of AuNPs
as a capping agent. The d-spacings of adjacent planes
were 2.4 Å, which correspond to the (111) planes of the Au crystal.
Unlike spherical AuNPs synthesized using high concentrations of dextran-g-ct, gold nanodendrite structures were generated at low
concentrations of dextran-g-ct (1 and 0.17 mM catechol-based
concentrations) (Figure 5b), which seem that several AuNPs were connected along the polymer
templates, dextran-g-ct. The anisotropic growth of
gold nanostructures could be caused by limited ligand protection (LLP),
as suggested by the previous studies.52−55 The LLP domain did not provide sufficient ligand protection to induce
crystal growth or directional attachment. As the concentration of
dextran-g-ct was decreased, the surface of AuNPs
became less stable because the number of small capping agents adsorbed
on the surface was not enough. The branched gold nanostructures were
generated presumably due to the connection of these less stable AuNPs
for reducing the surface energy, whereas the catechol moieties of
dextran-g-ct might be adsorbed on the surfaces of
several AuNPs and induce the reduction of gold ion along the dextran-g-ct chains between the AuNPs. The TEM images of the branched
gold nanostructures show that the d-spacings of adjacent
planes were 2.4 and 2.0 Å, corresponding to the (111) and (200)
planes of the Au crystal, respectively (Figure 5e). The UV–vis absorption spectra
show the SPR peaks of gold nanodendrites (Figures S8 and S9). The difference of absorbance resulted from the
conversion efficiency of gold ions to solid gold nanostructures. The
absorbance was increased with the increased concentration of dextran-g-ct because of the increased amounts of AuNPs reduced by
the high concentration of catechols. The three-dimensional (3D) morphology
of the gold nanodendrites was confirmed using TEM tomography. Figure 6 shows the bright-field
and high-angle annular dark field (HAADF) scanning transmission electron
microscopy (STEM) tilt series of the gold nanodendrites, which were
synthesized with 0.4 mM HAuCl4 and 0.17 mM catechol grafted
on dextran-g-ct in an 85:15 (v/v) mixture of DMA
and deionized water.

We further investigated the kinetics
of the formation of AuNPs
using a mixture of dextran-g-ct and dopamine (Figure 7). The clusters of
small AuNPs were formed with an average size of 66.7 ± 22.1 nm
(Figure S10), which were distinctive from
the morphology of AuNPs synthesized using pyrocatechol only (Figure 4). The result indicates
that the use of dextran-g-ct can effectively slow
down the reduction rate of gold ions. The AuNP clusters were covered
with a very thin organic layer, which also indicates that the small
AuNPs were generated quickly by dopamine and stabilized by dextran-g-ct that are adsorbed on the several AuNPs and formed the
stable spherical aggregates with the cover of a very thin layer. The
absorbance of AuNPs synthesized with a mixture of dextran-g-ct and dopamine shows that the reduction process was promoted
by dopamine and controlled efficiently by dextran-g-ct.

Figure 7 TEM images of AuNP clusters synthesized from 0.27 mM HAuCl4 with a mixture of dextran-g-ct (0.11 mM
catechol) and 1.33 mM dopamine in an 85:15 (v/v) mixture of DMA and
deionized water.

3 Conclusions
This study demonstrated that the morphology of gold nanostructures
could be readily controlled using a catechol-grafted polymeric template
in a mixture of water and an organic solvent. The size, morphology,
and reduction kinetics of AuNPs could be adjusted by changing the
ratio of dimethylacetamide to water and the functional groups of catechol.
Although AuNPs were quickly aggregated in water, stable about 2 nm
AuNPs were obtained in the mixture of DMA and water as 85 and 15 vol
%, respectively. The functional groups of catechol also dramatically
affected the formation of AuNPs. In contrast to DHPA and 4-tert-butylcatehcol, dopamine that undergoes oxidative polymerization
showed faster kinetics while synthesizing AuNPs bigger than 50 nm.
As a polymeric template, dextran-g-ct was synthesized
by conjugating catechols to the backbone of dextran with a grafting
density of 5.9 mol %. Gold nanodendrites were synthesized at a low
concentration of dextran-g-ct, whereas spherical
AuNPs coated with dextran-g-ct were produced when
the concentration of dextran-g-ct was increased.
The synthesized gold nanodendrites exhibited excellent dispersion
stability in water presumably because dextran stabilized the surfaces
of gold nanodendrites with the strong binding affinity of catechols
to metals. This study demonstrated that a mussel-inspired modification
of polymer templates is an efficient means to synthesize colloidal
gold nanodendrites, which are potentially attractive for applications
to biosensing, catalysis, and photothermal therapy.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Chemicals and Materials
Hydrogen
tetrachloroaurate (III) trihydrate (HAuCl4·3H2O), dopamine hydrochloride, CDI, hydroquinone, and dextran
(molecular weight ≈ 6 kDa from Leuconostoc spp.) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Milli-Q water was used as deionized
water in all experiments.

4.2 Synthesis of AuNPs Using
Catechols
HAuCl4 was first dissolved in DMA, and
deionized water
was added to adjust the concentration (0.72 mM) and the DMA/water
ratio. The mixture (5.5 mL) was magnetically stirred for 1 min at
90 °C, followed by the immediate addition of a catechol solution
(4.5 mM in 4.5 mL DMA). The final concentrations were 0.4 mM for HAuCl4 and 2 mM for catechol.

4.3 Synthesis
of Catechol-Grafted Dextran
Dextran-g-ct
was synthesized according to our previous
reports.26,29 Dextran (1.0 g, 6 mmol based on the glucose
unit) was dissolved in 7 mL of anhydrous DMSO. CDI (98.5 mg, 0.6 mmol)
in 3 mL of anhydrous DMSO was added to the dextran solution, followed
by incubation at ambient temperature for 2 h. Dopamine hydrochloride
(186 mg, 1.2 mmol) dissolved in 2 mL of anhydrous DMSO was then added
to the CDI-activated dextran solution. Hydroquinone (668.5 mg, 6 mmol)
dissolved in 4 mL of anhydrous DMSO was also added to prevent the
oxidation of dopamine during the reaction. The conjugation reaction
was carried out with magnetic stirring at 300 rpm at ambient temperature
for 24 h. The product was isolated by repeated precipitation in a
6:4 mixture of isopropanol and hexane.

4.4 Synthesis
of Gold Nanostructures Using Dextran-g-ct
A HAuCl4 solution (0.8 mM) and
three different concentrations of dextran-g-ct solutions
(containing 4, 2, and 0.34 mM catechol) were prepared in an 85:15
(v/v) mixture of DMA and deionized water. The HAuCl4 solution
(500 μL) was magnetically stirred for 1 min at 90 °C in
an oil bath, followed by the immediate addition of 500 μL of
the dextran-g-ct solution. The final concentrations
were 0.4 mM for HAuCl4 and 2, 1, and 0.17 mM for the dextran-g-ct solutions. AuNP clusters were synthesized using a mixture
of dextran-g-ct and dopamine as the reducing and
capping agents. The solutions of HAuCl4 (0.8 mM), dopamine
(4 mM), and dextran-g-ct (0.34 mM catechol) were
prepared in an 85:15 (v/v) mixture of DMA and deionized water. The
HAuCl4 solution (500 μL) was magnetically stirred
for 1 min at 90 °C in the oil bath, followed by the immediate
addition of 500 μL of the dextran-g-ct solution
and 500 μL of the dopamine solution. The mixture was magnetically
stirred for 10 min at 90 °C in the oil bath for reaction. After
the reaction, the solution was centrifuged and washed three times.

4.5 Characterization
Dextran-g-ct was analyzed using nuclear magnetic resonance (1H
NMR, Bruker Avance, 400 MHz) and UV–vis spectrophotometry
(UV-1601, Shimadzu, Japan). The morphology of the prepared nanoparticles
was observed using transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEOL JEM-3011
HR, Japan) at an acceleration voltage of 300 kV. The 3D tomography
images of gold nanostructures were observed using TEM (FEI Talos F200X)
at an acceleration voltage of 200 kV.
