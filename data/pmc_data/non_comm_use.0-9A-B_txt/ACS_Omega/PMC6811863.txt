A new synthetic strategy
to the ABCD ring system of the anticancer
agent fredericamycin A (NSC-305263) was realized by the Diels–Alder
reaction and olefin metathesis as key steps. The tactics developed
here for the construction of the ABCD ring system also involve double
Claisen rearrangement followed by a retro-Diels–Alder reaction
and ring-closing metathesis. The metathesis approach performs a key
role in the construction of A and D rings of the ABCD core unit. More
importantly, ABCD fragment synthesis was accomplished without the
involvement of protecting groups.

Introduction
Fredericamycin A 1 (Figure 1), a quinone-based natural product, was first
isolated in 1981 from the fermentation broth of the strain Streptomyces griseus (ATCC 49344, FCRC-48).1 It comprises a hexacyclic ring containing a single
chiral quaternary center (spiro[4.4]nonene ring system) conjoined
with the naphthoquinone and isoquinolone moieties, which are not present
in any other natural product.2 The design
and synthesis of highly oxygenated polyaromatic fredericamycin A 1 are difficult tasks due to the presence of a dense functionality,
and synthesis is important due to its in vitro cytotoxic and in vivo
antibiotic antitumor activity.3

Figure 1 Structure of
fredericamycin A 1.

Because of its special features of the spirocyclic core (spiro[4.4]nonane
ring), fredericamycin A 1 exhibits an interesting biological
activity,4 is highly cytotoxic against
murine leukemia KB and Du-145 prostate tumors, and also shows good
activity against in vivo tumor models such as P338D1 mouse leukemia,
CD8F mammary tumors, B16 melanoma, and L1210 cell lines.5,3b Fredericamycin A also acts as a potent inhibitor against ovarian
tumors and also inhibits both topoisomerases I and II.6,3b Furthermore, compound 1 exhibited an irreversible inhibitor
of the peptidyl-prolyl cis–trans isomerase (PPI) Pin 1 with a Ki of 0.82 μM
and also inhibited the DNA processing enzymes.7,6,3b In this context, several synthetic routes
have been reported in the literature.8 The
first successful total synthesis of compound 1 was completed
in racemic form by Kelly and co-workers in 1986.9 Afterward, several research groups like Boger et al.,5 Clive et al.,8c Kita
et al.,8e Bach et al.,11 and Rama Rao et al.8d reported
the total synthesis of fredericamycin.

Limited approaches are
available for the synthesis of the spirocyclic
indene framework of fredericamycin A 1.10 These includes the rearrangement reactions,11 cycloadditions,12 intermolecular alkyne-chromium carbene complex cyclization,13 metal-mediated 1,2-carbonyl shift,14 radical pathways,15 photochemical approach,16 Diels–Alder
reactions (DA),17 and palladium-catalyzed
cross-coupling acylation.18 The construction
of a spirocyclic ring system is indeed a synthetic challenge. To the
best of our knowledge, there are no reports available for the construction
of the spirocyclic core with a functionalized BCD ring system of fredericamycin
A 1 through double Claisen rearrangement (CR) and ring-closing
metathesis (RCM) as key steps. Here, the RCM protocol was identified
as a key step to create a spirocyclic core, the A and D ring system
of fredericamycin A 1. Several metathesis catalysts are
now available for ring closure of olefinic precursors. Here, we used
G-I and G-II catalysts to realize the metathesis step. The key synthon
to fredericamycin A 1, consisting of the ABCD ring system,
was assembled by adopting the DA reaction,19 Claisen rearrangement,20 and RCM protocol.21 The key steps in our synthetic strategy involving
RCM for CD ring construction, ceric ammonium nitrate (CAN) oxidation,
and DA reaction along with the aromatization sequence have been considered
to assemble a fully functionalized BCD ring system. Additionally,
one-pot Claisen rearrangement (CR) with the retro-Diels–Alder
reaction (rDA)22 followed by RCM provides
a new entry to the ABCD framework of fredericamycin A 1.

Results and Discussion
Our retrosynthetic approach to the
ABCD ring system 2 of fredericamycin A 1 is shown in Scheme 1. The target molecule 2 may be assembled from bis-hydroxy
derivative 3 via the RCM and oxidation sequence. Interestingly,
the bis-hydroxy
derivative 3 could be derived from the aromatized compound 4 through O-allylation and one-pot double
Claisen rearrangement (CR) followed by the rDA reaction. The dihydroxy
ketone 4 may be generated from 5 via oxidation
and DA reactions followed by aromatization. The spiro derivative 5 can be obtained from dimethoxy indanone 6 by C-allylation followed by RCM. Indanone 6 was
prepared from the commercially available starting material such as
2,5-dimethoxybenzaldehyde 7 based on the known procedures.23

Scheme 1 Retrosynthetic Approach toward ABCD Core 2 of Fredericamycin
A 1
Our journey toward
the target molecule 2 started with
the synthesis of key building block dimethoxy indanone 6.23 In this regard, 2,5-dimethoxybenzaldehyde 7 reacted with malonic acid under Knoevenagel conditions to
produce the acid 8(23a) in 88%
yield. Next, acid derivative 8 was subjected to hydrogenation
with 10% Pd/C and gave the saturated acid 9 in 97% yield.
Further, acid-catalyzed cyclization of 9 in the presence
of phosphorous pentoxide (P2O5) and methanesulfonic
acid (MeSO3H) produced the dimethoxy indanone derivative 6 (69%).23c−23g Having prepared the known indanone derivative 6, our
next target was the spiro[4.4]nonene ring system, which constitutes
the CD ring fragment of fredericamycin A. Next, the indanone 6 was subjected to allylation with allyl bromide in the presence
of NaH in THF to provide the diallyl indanone 10 in excellent
yield. Subsequently, the indanone derivative 10 proceeded
for RCM via the G-II catalyst to generate the ring-closure product 5 (89%). Here, we observed that spiro ring formation with
a quaternary center in the presence of the G-I catalyst is slower
and the RCM product has less yield (60–65%). The structure
of the RCM product 5 (Scheme 2) has been proven by spectral parameters
(1H, 13C NMR, and HRMS data).

Scheme 2 Synthesis of Spirocyclic
Compound 5
Having prepared the tricyclic spiro compound 5, the
attention was then directed toward its expansion to the ABCD ring
system. The spiro ketone 5 was subjected for CAN oxidation
at 0 °C to deliver the quinone derivative 11, which
acts as a powerful dienophile in the DA reaction with cyclopentadiene.
Thermal cycloaddition of quinone 11 with a freshly cracked
cyclopentadiene gave the DA adduct 12 in excellent yield
(92%). Armed with the DA adduct 12 in hand, we focused
our efforts to assemble the ABCD core of fredericamycin A 1. In this regard, the Diels–Alder adduct 12 was
further treated for aromatization24 with
60–120 mesh silica gel to generate the corresponding annulated
hydroquinone-fused norbornadiene 4 in moderate yield
(Scheme 3). The aromatized
product structure 4 was supported by spectral data (1H, 13C NMR DEPT 135, and HRMS). Next, the hydroquinone 4 was O-allylated under basic conditions
using allyl bromide in dry DMF to produce the diallyl compound 13 in 77% yield. To introduce the A ring of the ABCD core
of fredericamycin A 1, we utilized a one-pot rDA reaction
followed by double CR. To this end, the O-allyl derivative 13 was heated at 180 °C in a sealed tube for 12 h to
produce the diallyl hydroquinone 3 in 40% yield (based
on the starting material recovered, 11%). Also, several minor products
were formed during the rearrangement sequence, and they could not
be isolated in pure form (TLC monitoring).

Scheme 3 Synthetic Approach
to ABCD Core 2 of Fredericamycin
A 1
The formation of unexpected
hydroquinone derivative 3 can be explained on the basis
of initially formed quinone intermediate 3A from compound 13 (via Claisen/Retro), which
undergoes rapid transformation to hydroquinone 3 due
to the presence of the active −CH2 group adjacent
to the spiro system, which acts as a hydrogen source and is further
involved in the aromatization process (Figure 2). The highly conjugated quinone 3A participated in the generation of carbocation intermediate 3C via vinylogous enol 3B. Later on, the formed
carbocation 3C further rearranged to 3D,
and elimination of proton followed to produce 3E. Finally,
the quinone intermediate 3A was involved in the virtual
disproportionation to give the major product 3 along
with the oxidized product 3F. The by-product 3F was confirmed by its mass spectral (HRMS) data (Supporting Information).

Figure 2 Suggested mechanism for hydroquinone 3 formation.

To install the A ring
by the RCM strategy, compound 3 was reacted with the
Grubbs (G-I) catalyst to generate the tetracyclic
compound (RCM product) 14. The RCM product 14 was fully established with spectral parameters such as IR, 1H NMR, and 13C NMR and further supported by HRMS
data (Scheme 3). To
complete the target compound, the ABCD ring analogue of fredericamycin
A 1, the RCM product 14 was subjected to
SeO2 oxidation in dioxane for 2 h at 70 °C to produce
compound 2 in 38% yield. There are some other minor products
(observed by TLC) that were formed during this process, and they could
not be isolated in pure form by column chromatography. The structure
of compound 2 was supported with 1H, 13C NMR, and mass spectroscopic data (Scheme 3).

Conclusions
To conclude, we have
established a useful synthetic strategy to
assemble the ABCD ring system of antitumor agent fredericamycin A
starting with commercially available 2,5-dimethoxybenzaldehyde 7 through the CR and two-fold RCM sequence. The metathesis
sequence provided an opportunity for the construction of A and D rings
of the ABCD framework of fredericamycin A. So far, there are no reports
available in the literature for the construction of the ABCD core
of fredericamycin A. Here, a tactful combination of RCM, one-pot rDA
reaction, and double CR has been used to provide access to the target
molecule. Moreover, construction of the ABCD ring system of fredericamycin
A 1 was successfully established with protecting-group-free
synthesis.25

Experimental Section
General
Experimental Details
All of the essential reagents,
chemicals, and required solvents were used as such directly obtained
from commercial suppliers. Thin-layer chromatography (TLC) plates
were made on 10 × 5 glass plates layered with commercial grade
Acme silica gel (GF-254) containing 13% CaSO4, which acts
as a binder. All the reaction progress was analyzed by the chromatographic
technique (TLC analysis) with suitable solvent systems (EtOAc/Pet
ether), and observation was done by UV, iodine spray, and immersion
in KMnO4 solution. Moisture-sensitive (dry/anhydrous) reactions
were performed by oven-dried glassware under a nitrogen/argon atmosphere
by using syringe-septum techniques. Column purification was done by
100–200 mesh silica gel in all cases with suitable solvent
systems. Dimethylformamide (DMF) and CH2Cl2 were
distilled over calcium hydride (CaH2), and EtOAc was dried
with anhydrous K2CO3.

All IR samples were
recorded with DCM and chloroform as solvents on a Nicolet Impact-400
FTIR spectrometer. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra (1H, 13C, and DEPT 135) were recorded on 400 and
500 MHz spectrometers (Bruker) with a CDCl3 solvent, and
chemical shifts (δ ppm) are reported relative to the internal
standard such as TMS. The J values (coupling constants)
are given in hertz. Mass spectra (HRMS) were recorded under positive
ion electrospray ionization (ESI, Q-TOF) mode.

2,5-Dimethoxybenzaldehyde 7 (5 g, 30 mmol),
malonic acid (6 g, 60 mmol), and pyridine (10 mL) were placed in a
two-neck RB, the mixture was heated at 80 °C, and then piperidine
(1 mL) was added. Later on, the reaction mixture was heated at 80
°C for 1 h, and slowly, the temperature was increased to 110–115
°C for 3 h. Upon completion, the reaction mixture was allowed
to cool, and then cold water was poured. Acidification by HCl (pH
5) led to the formation of crude acid 8 as a yellow precipitate.
Afterward, crude (E)-3-(2,5-dimethoxyphenyl)acrylic
acid was recrystallized from EtOAc/hexane and yielded the pure cinnamic
acid 8 as yellow crystalline needles.

5′,6′-Diallyl-4′,7′-dihydroxyspiro[cyclopentane-1,2′-inden]-3-en-1′(3′H)-one (3)
Compound 13 (440 mg, 1.22 mmol) in 1,2-dichlorobenzene (4 mL) in a sealed tube
was degassed with N2 gas for 5 min with stirring. Then
the solution was kept at 180 °C for 12 h. After the completion
of the reaction, the crude product was directly loaded on a 100–200
mesh silica gel, and the column was eluted with pet ether (200 mL)
until 1,2-dichlorobenzene was removed. Further, 2–3% ethyl
acetate/petroleum ether elution furnished the rDA derivative 3 as a dark brown liquid along with the starting material
in 11% yield.

4′,9′-Dihydroxy-5′,8′-dihydrospiro[cyclopentane-1,2′-cyclopenta[b]naphthalen]-3-en-1′(3′H)-one (14)
A magnetically stirred solution
of compound 3 (120 mg, 0.40 mmol) in dry DCM (30 mL)
was degasified for 5 min with nitrogen. Later on, the G-I catalyst
(16 mg, 5 mol %) was added, and then stirring was continued at rt
for 3 h. Then the solvent was evaporated, and the crude reaction mixture
was subjected to column chromatography (100–200 mesh silica
gel, 20% EtOAc/PE) to give the ring-closure product 14 as a yellow crystalline solid.

Synthesis of ABCD Core (2) of
Fredericamycin A
(1)
A solution of SeO2 (124 mg, 1.11
mmol) in 1,4-dioxane (20 mL) was added with HCOOH (0.5 mL). Then the
solution of compound 14 (50 mg, 0.186) in 1,4-dioxane
(10 mL) was added, and the resulting mixture was allowed to heat slowly
from rt to 70 °C for 2 h. Afterward, the solvent was removed,
extracted with EtOAc, washed with brine solution, and dried over anhydrous
Na2SO4. The crude mixture further proceeded
to silica gel column purification (20% EtOAc/PE) to obtain the oxidized
product 2 as a yellow crystalline solid.
