A convenient
procedure for the synthesis of aryl(trifloxyalkenyl)iodonium
triflate salts from commercially available (diacetoxyiodo)benzene,
trimethylsilyl trifluoromethanesulfonate, and acetylenes under mild
conditions was developed. The obtained multifunctional hypervalent
vinyliodonium salts equipped with electrophilic and nucleophilic functions
could serve as novel C2 synthons for organic transformations. The
structure of the iodonium salts was identified by multidimensional
NMR spectroscopy and X-ray crystallography.

Introduction
In the last decade,
the synthesis and application of hypervalent
iodine reagents became a hot topic in synthetic organic chemistry.
Due to their electrophilic character, high reactivity, general low
toxicity, and easy preparation, +3 oxidation state organic iodonium
salts are frequently used in arylation, alkenylation, alkynylation,
or alkylation reactions.1 Although the
number of applications of these hypervalent reagents increases, the
synthesis and utilization of alkenyl derivatives2 are still a less explored topic of hypervalent iodine chemistry.3 However, the alkenyl function appears as an important
molecular motif in innumerable syntheses of valuable chemical compounds.4 Therefore, the design of direct alkenylation
reactions and multifunctional alkenyl building blocks has great synthetic
potential.5 To fulfill this synthetic demand,
(trifloxyalkenyl)iodonium triflate salts6 were designed and utilized in ligand exchange reactions resulting
various diaryliodonium species,7 palladium-catalyzed
cross-coupling reactions,8 and also in
metal-free substituted oxazole ring formation reaction.9

Although the synthesis of aryl(trifloxyalkenyl)iodonium
triflate
salts can be achieved starting from iodosylbenzene, trifluoromethanesulfonic
acid, and acetylenes,10 their synthesis
is based on the utilization of less available I(III) species (prepared
from DIB) and highly sensitive TfOH. Most importantly, the efficiency
of the synthesis is limited to 50% maximum theoretical yield because
of the 1:1 ratio of λ3 iodane source to triflate
anion (Scheme 1). Of
note, there are three examples for the syntheses of the target alkenes,
starting from ArI or PhI(OAc)2, but the first strategy
uses special FXeOTf reagent,6e and there
are only two reactions of DIB with 2 equiv of TfOH and terminal alkyne,
which reportedly reach 55 and 56% isolated yield, respectively.7a,7c

Scheme 1 Previous Literature Procedures, Highlighting the Formation of Trifloxyalkenyl(aryl)iodonium
Triflates from Two Hypervalent Iodine Reagent
To overcome the limitations of the aforementioned existing
procedures
and expand the chemical space of available alkenyl(aryl)iodonium salts,
we aimed to design new procedure and synthetic approach for the efficient
synthesis of novel multifunctional alkenyl synthons using less corrosive
trimethylsilyl triflate (TMSOTf) as triflate source and readily available
aryliodonium source such as (diacetoxyiodo)benzene (DIB, 3) (Scheme 2). Our
synthetic strategy is based on the utilization of both internal and
terminal acetylenes containing versatile alkyl, aryl, and hetaryl
fragments equipped with various synthetically useful functional groups
(OH, Br, Cl, CN).

Scheme 2 Retrosynthetic Approach to the Access of Multifunctional
Aryl(trifloxyalkenyl)iodonium
Triflate Salts
Results and Discussion
We began the synthetic investigation with the preparation of phenyl(trifloxyalkenyl)iodonium
triflate salt from DIB and phenylacetylene using TMSOTf as activator.
Compared to the final, optimized reaction conditions, the following
modifications resulted in lower than 41% yield: the concentration
of DIB higher than 0.5 mol/L, less inert or polar solvents, higher
or lower reaction temperatures, longer reaction time, and less equivalent
of added acetylene or TMSOTf (Scheme 3).

Scheme 3 Study of the Conditions of the Preparation of 6a
Additionally, increasing
the amount of phenylacetylene up to 1.5
equiv did not give the target product in higher yield. Drawing the
lessons, we determined the best synthetic conditions to the access
of the target compounds 6a. To the anhydrous dichloromethane
solution of DIB, 2 equiv of trimethylsilyl trifluoromethanesulfonate
have been added at 0 °C and the temperature increased to 25 °C.
The colorless solution turns yellow by forming bis(trifloxy)iodobenzene
(4).11 The solution was cooled
again to 0 °C, and the acetylene derivative was added dropwise.
The reaction mixture darkened while the desired aryl(trifloxyalkenyl)iodonium
triflate product forms and may precipitate from the solution at 0
°C. For the completion of the reaction, we allowed to warm up
the mixture to 25 °C. As shown in Scheme 3, after the evaporation of solvent and recrystallization
procedure, we obtained the unsubstituted phenyl derivative 6a as a white solid with 56% yield.

In general, the reaction
took place in a similar manner, resulting
in off-white solids after crystallization; nevertheless, the determination
of their structure was a more complex task. To study the influence
of steric and electronic effect of substituents on aromatic systems,
a series of hypervalent iodonium salts have been synthesized (Scheme 4).

Scheme 4 Scope of Aryl-Substituted
Phenyl(vinyltrifloxy)iodonium Triflate
Salts
The methyl group in para position
has no significant effect on
the reaction and gave 6b in 52% yield, but the yields
of 6c meta or 6d ortho methyl product were
42 and 22%, respectively. However, the presence of methyl group reduced
the yields, and under the reaction conditions, the formation of E product gained advantage over Z isomer.
The structure of the E-6a and E-6c product has been determined also by X-ray
crystallography (Figure 1).12

level with partial
numbering scheme. Selected bond distance [Å] and bond angle [deg]
data: I1-C1 2.091 (9); C1-C2 1.298 (14); I1-C11 2.112 (7); C2-C21

(3).

The para-fluoro 6e and bromo-substituted 6f aryl derivatives
were synthesized in 48 and 34% yields,
respectively. Pushing the limits further, we have experienced similar
consequences in the case of the electron-rich para-methoxyphenyl 6g and the bulky diphenylethyne 6h, and no product isolated. However, the steric hindrance
does not appear in the reaction of 4-phenylbut-3-yn-2-one and the 6i product formed effectively with 65%. There is one example
to show the opportunity of the transformation of heterocyclic acetylenes:
we have synthesized 3-ethynylthiophene to the corresponding 6j product with 57% efficiency.

Fortunately, the reaction
was not limited to the aromatic acetylenes;
therefore, we investigated the synthesis of phenyl(alkenyltrifloxy)iodonium
triflate salts utilizing alkyl acetylene reactants. With the best
reaction conditions in hand, we started to examine the effect of structural
diversity on acetylene derivatives (Scheme 5). First, we synthesized the simplest and
unsubstituted phenyl(vinyltrifloxy)iodonium triflate salt (7a) by bubbling acetylene gas into the reaction mixture, which yielded
the vinyl salt in 23% yield. This low yield is understandable since
the product (7a) is highly soluble in most of organic
solvents and decomposes quickly. Increasing the length of side chains
on vinyl moiety by the application of different terminal alkylacetylenes
resulted in higher stability, lower solubility, and better yields.
The transformation of hex-3-yne, hex-1-yne, and oct-1-yne yielded
the desired products in 52% (7b), 48% (7c), and 66% (7d) yields, respectively. The experiments
have shown that the external and internal acetylene can be utilized,
and the presence of ethyl groups has no steric hindrance effect on
the formation of the salts. The molecular structures of selected iodonium
species were identified by X-ray measurement.12

Scheme 5 Scope of Alkyl-Substituted Phenyl(vinyltrifloxy)iodonium Triflate
Salts
Next, we reacted cycloalkyl
acetylenes with DIB in the presence
of TMSOTf under the optimal reaction conditions. Similarly to the
previous experimental experiences, we found analogous tendency of
the yields as a function of ring size. The cyclopropyl-substituted
phenyl(vinyl)iodonium triflate salt (7e) was obtained
with only 11% yield; nevertheless, the extension of alkyl chain decreased
the solubility of the salts and increased the yield as well. Accordingly,
the cyclopentyl (7f, 31%), cyclohexyl (7g, 40%), and benzyl (7h, 62%) derivatives resulted in
higher yields.

Moving forward to the synthesis of more challenging
multifunctional
alkenyliodonium salts, we studied the synthetic applicability of different
terminal alkylacetylenes functionalized with OAc, OH, Br, Cl, and
CN groups at the alkyl terminal. These functions enable further transformations
on the side chain with the utilization of nucleophilic or electrophilic
reagents. Although under the reaction conditions the ester functionality
(7i) was not tolerated, the unprotected propargyl alcohol
and but-3-yn-1-ol underwent reaction and gave the corresponding hypervalent
iodine product 7j in 45% yield and 7k in
71% yield. Interestingly, we observed diminished stability at 25 °C
in the case of 7k compared to 7j, which
can be rationalized by the more flexible alkyl chain and a potential
intramolecular cyclization side reaction. Next, we studied the reactivity
of alkynes bearing halogen and pseudohalogen functional groups. It
was found that the propargyl bromide can be transformed into compound 7l with 40% yield. The structure of this trifunctional alkenyliodonium
salt has been confirmed by X-ray measurements.12

The longer alkyl chain primary chloro 7m and cyano 7n products formed in good yields, 66 and
84%, respectively.

As the NMR measurements revealed, under the
reaction conditions,
the Z isomer formed in the same way as the E isomer. However, the DFT calculations showed that the
energy gap between the Z and E product
is very low.12 We found that the presence
of an alkyl or aryl group in (vinyltrifloxy)iodonium moiety favored
in E position. The separation of Z and E products is not feasible by crystallization.

Conclusions
In summary, we developed a new synthetic method for the preparation
of substituted trifloxyvinyliodonium triflates using commercially
available, easy-to-handle starting materials such as acetylene, (diacetoxyiodo)benzene,
and trimethylsilyl triflate. The synthesis of the target compounds
was performed under mild reaction conditions, and the procedure ensures
a novel synthetic route to multifunctional alkynyliodonium salts with
wide structural diversity, which were identified by multidimensional
NMR measurements and X-ray crystallography. The obtained hypervalent
vinyliodonium salts containing electrophilic and nucleophilic functions
could serve as novel alkenyl building blocks for versatile organic
transformations.

Experimental Section
General Conditions
Analytical thin-layer chromatography
(TLC) was performed on Merck DC precoated TLC plates with 0.25 mm
Kieselgel 60 F254. Visualization was performed with a 254 nm UV lamp.

The 1H, 13C, and 19F NMR spectra
were recorded on Agilent (Varian) VNMRS-400 and VNMR-600 spectrometers
in CD2Cl2. Measurements were performed on indirect
detection Z-gradient probes. Chemical shifts are expressed in parts
per million (δ). The 1H and 13C chemical
shifts are referenced to the residual solvent signals; for 19F chemical shifts, CFCl3 internal standard is used. Coupling
constants (J) are reported in hertz (Hz). Splitting
patterns are designated as s (singlet), bs (broad singlet), d (doublet),
t (triplet), q (quartet), and m (multiplet). The structure determination
is based on one- (1H, 13C, 19F NMR,
selective 1d-noesy) and two-dimensional (1H-13C-gHSQCAD, 1H-13C-gHMBCAD, 1H-zqTOCSY)
NMR experiments. NMR assignments refer in each case to the main (trans)
component except in the case of 6j where both the trans
and Z isomers could be fully assigned.

IR spectra
were obtained in dichloromethane solutions on a Mettler
Toledo ReactIR 15, AgX DiComp probe, 6 mm × 1.5 m Fiber (silver
halide), MCT detector. The in situ reactions were conducted in the
following setup: sampling interval, 15 s; 2500–650 cm–1 (resolution, 8 cm–1); scan option, AutoSelect;
gain, 1×. Data were processed by Mettler Toledo iC IR.

All melting points were measured on Büchi 501 apparatus
and are uncorrected.

High-resolution mass spectra were acquired
on an Agilent 6230 time-of-flight
mass spectrometer equipped with a Jet Stream electrospray ion source
in positive-ion mode. Injections of 0.1–0.3 μL were directed
to the mass spectrometer at a flow rate of 0.5 mL/min (70% acetonitrile–water
mixture, 0.1% formic acid), using an Agilent 1260 Infinity HPLC system.
Jet Stream parameters: drying gas (N2) flow and temperature,
10.0 L/min and 325 °C, respectively; nebulizer gas (N2) pressure, 10 psi; capillary voltage, 4000 V; sheath gas flow and
temperature, 325 °C and 7.5 L/min, respectively; TOFMS parameters:
fragmentor voltage, 120 V; skimmer potential, 120 V; OCT 1 RF Vpp,
750 V. Full-scan mass spectra were acquired over the m/z range of 100–2500 at an acquisition rate
of 250 ms/spectrum and processed by Agilent MassHunter B.03.01 software.

Preparation of Aryl(trifloxyalkenyl)iodonium Triflate Salts
A 30 mL vial was charged with (diacetoxyiodo)benzene (98%, 1 equiv,
5 mmol, 1643 mg), equipped with a stirring bar, and then sealed with
a cap. The reaction atmosphere changed to argon by three consecutive
evacuation and argon backfillation processes. Then, 10 mL of absolute
dichloromethane was added by a syringe and stirred at 25 °C for
5 min. The solution was cooled to 0 °C and stirred vigorously
for 10 min. Trimethylsilyl trifluoromethanesulfonate (98%, 2 equiv,
10 mmol, 2268 mg, 1.85 mL) was added dropwise in 1 min. The solution
turned to a clear yellow solution. The reaction mixture was allowed
to warm up to 25 °C and stirred for 2 h. Then, the solution was
cooled to 0 °C and acetylene derivative (1.2 equiv, 6 mmol) was
added dropwise by a syringe in 2 min under vigorous stirring. The
reaction mixture was allowed to warm up to 25 °C. The yellow
solution turned to a dark-colored mixture. After 2 h, the solvent
was evaporated and cold diethyl ether and pentane were added and cooled
in a freezer to crystallize the salts. The precipitates were collected
by filtration, and in case the solid was not white due to the decomposition
products, it was washed with absolute 1,2-dichloroethane (in case
of aryl derivatives), diethyl ether, and pentane to obtain pure white
compound. The materials were dried quickly in high vacuum at 25 °C,
capped tightly, and stored in a freezer at −20 °C. In
these conditions, the salts remained usable for more than half of
year.
