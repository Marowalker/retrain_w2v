Fatty acid esters
of 2-ethyl-1-hexanol (EH), 2-hexyl-1-decanol (HD), and isopropanol
have been obtained from a mixture of ethyl esters obtained as a fish
oil byproduct. Homogeneous base catalysis with alkaline hydroxides
and alkoxides has been compared with the use of two commercially available
immobilized lipases. The enzymatic methodology is more efficient in
the case of the largest alcohol (HD) mainly because of the high stability
of the immobilized enzymes upon recovery and reuse. In contrast, the
use of a base as a catalyst is highly favorable in the case of isopropanol
because of the rather poor activity of the lipases and the low price
of the bases. With EH, the activity of lipases is good but the recoverability
is not as efficient; hence, basic catalysts are again the most attractive
alternative. The mixtures of esters obtained may be useful as hydraulic
liquids given their viscosity values.

Introduction
Fatty esters of simple
alcohols are used in a wide variety of applications. Lower esters,
for example, are mainly used as biodiesel fuel,1 which mostly comprises methyl and ethyl fatty esters, along
with some isopropyl esters,2,3 prepared by the base-catalyzed
transesterification of triglycerides, although the use of lipases
is a topic of current interest.4,5 These lower esters,
as well as some higher esters, are also components in a large number
of different consumer goods, such as lubricants,6 coolants for metal machining,7 drilling fluids,8 or printing inks,9,10 and are also used as biodiesel additives11,12 or reagent solvents in alkyd resins.13

2-Ethylhexyl esters are among the most common simple fatty
esters of higher alcohols used in most of the applications mentioned
above. Apart from acid-catalyzed14 or lipase-catalyzed15 esterification of free fatty acids (FAs), these
compounds have been prepared by transesterification using two alternative
methods. Thus, base-catalyzed transesterification has been applied
to FA methyl esters (FAMEs) using MeONa,8 with an alcohol/FAME molar ratio of 2, high vacuum conditions (1.5
mbar), and relatively large amounts of the base (2% w/w with respect
to the total mass of reactants, which represents around 20 mol % with
respect to FAMEs), at 70–100 °C. On the other hand, lipases
have been used as biocatalysts for the transesterification of FAMEs16,17 or triglycerides.18,19 In the large-scale (28 kg of
FAMEs) optimized process,16 milder conditions
were used (alcohol/FAME molar ratio of 1.47, 55 °C, 100–150
mm Hg), although a large quantity of the enzyme (9.3% w/w with respect
to the total weight of reactants), which in principle should be recoverable
and reusable, is required.

Other 2-alkyl-1-alkanols have also
been used to prepare this kind of esters, for example, 2-hexyl-1-decyl
esters, which have been described as potentially useful cosmetic ingredients.20,21 To the best of our knowledge, the synthesis of these esters by transesterification
has not been described in the literature.

In these examples,
branching occurs at the 2-position of a primary alcohol. However,
it is also possible to introduce branching in the 1-position by using
a secondary alcohol, such as isopropanol. Thus, isopropyl fatty esters
have been prepared from triglycerides via basic catalysis, by the
formation of sodium isopropoxide using metallic Na,2,11 MeONa,13 or alkali metal hydroxides (NaOH and KOH) as
the base.22 The use of lipases for the
transesterification of triglycerides with isopropanol has also been
explored.23

The importance of omega-3
polyunsaturated FAs (PUFAs) in human health,24,25 and their low consumption in many developed countries, has fostered
the development of many nutritional products enriched with omega-3
concentrates, the main feedstock of which is still fish.26 The manufacture of omega-3 concentrates implies
their separation from other FAs present in fish oil, which are then
considered to be waste. In the context of the circular economy,27 there are several levels to close the circle
(reuse, remanufacturing, recycling, and disposal); therefore, waste
must be considered as simply another starting material. The energetic
valorization/recycling of this waste is one of the less interesting
alternatives.

In the edible fish industry, the possible use
of waste as biodiesel, which can be considered to be a type of energetic
valorization, is an economically interesting alternative.28,29 Indeed, the production of biodiesel from fish canning industry waste,
using base catalysis,30 and from waste
sardine oil in a lipase-catalyzed process31 has been described. However, the fish oil waste left over after
omega-3 separation is still high quality in terms of its characteristics
and absence of contaminants. Thus, its transformation into specific
bio-based products would represent a new and more attractive valorization
alternative (remanufacturing) that has already been proposed to biodiesel
manufacturers to extend the potential sales market.16

The transformation of biodiesel (FAMEs) into more
valuable products has been recently explored for nonedible Tilapia
(Oreochromisniloticus) oil by epoxidation
and subsequent epoxide ring opening to obtain biolubricants32 or by epoxidation of biodiesel from vegetable
oils to obtain bioplasticizers.33 In this
regard, we recently described the transesterification of waste fish
oil from omega-3 extraction with trimethylolpropane to obtain mixtures
of mono-, di-, and triesters, with the latter showing good properties
for use as biolubricants.34

In this
paper, we compare chemical and enzymatic methods for transesterifying
the FA ethyl ester waste left over from fish oil after PUFA extraction
using three different alcohols, namely, 2-ethyl-1-hexanol (EH), 2-hexyl-1-decanol
(HD), and isopropanol (iPrOH). Similar comparisons
are rare in the literature,35 where only
one type of method is usually studied and optimized. Additionally,
some of the key properties of the resulting ester mixtures for use
as biolubricants have also been determined.

Results and Discussion
A waste mixture of fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEEs) (500–600
ton/year) is generated by Solutex after the extraction of PUFAs from
fish oil. This waste mixture contains around 50 wt % saturated FAs
(SFAs), 25 wt % monounsaturated FAs (MUFAs), and 25 wt % PUFAs. The
average molecular weight of the sample used to calculate the molar
ratios was taken to be 296.5 (as methyl oleate).34

Base-Catalyzed Reactions
Transesterification Reactions
with EH
Preliminary tests showed the need to carry out the
reaction under vacuum to ensure high conversion of FAEEs. As the transesterification is an equilibrium reaction, it can be shifted
by eliminating one of the products (ethanol) from the reaction mixture.
A similar method has previously been applied for the transesterification
of FAMEs to eliminate methanol from the reaction mixture.8,16 The effect of different reaction parameters (amounts of the base
and EH and pressure) was tested with three different bases, namely,
two bases typically used in transesterification reactions (KOH and
EtONa) and one organic strong base (TBD: 1,5,7-triazabyciclo[4.4.0]dec-5-ene),
as catalysts. The results can be found in Table 1.

The starting conditions were 5 mol % KOH, EH/FAEE
molar ratio of 5, and 100 mbar (entry 1), which resulted in 77% conversion
in 1 h. Unfortunately, this could not be increased by increasing the
reaction time or by adding more EH, thus indicating that equilibrium
was reached. However, this equilibrium can be shifted with a more
efficient elimination of ethanol upon decreasing the pressure to 50
mbar (entry 2) or to 10 mbar (entry 3), which led to total conversion
in 4 h (95% in 1 h). This pressure was therefore used throughout this
study. The result was essentially identical when using EtONa (entry
4), whereas the reaction with TBD was much slower (entry 5).

Rather surprisingly, the results were slightly (entries 6 and 7)
or significantly (entry 8) better when the amount of alcohol was reduced
to 1.5 EH/FAEE molar ratio, with quantitative conversion in 1 h when
using KOH or EtONa, and more than 90% conversion in 3 h with TBD.
The dilution of FAEEs with larger amounts of alcohol may explain this
effect. As expected, a decrease in the reaction rate, which was much
more marked in the case of TBD (entry 11) than with KOH (entry 9),
was observed when the amount of the base was reduced to 1 mol %, whereas
EtONa still afforded quantitative conversion in 1 h (entry 10). Use
of a stoichiometric amount of alcohol led to conversion values in
the 92–96% range, irrespective of the amount of the base (entries
12–15), although this might be due to the averaged molecular
weight used to calculate the molar amount of FAEEs and the slight
variability in the composition of the different batches.

The
conditions of entry 10 were used to scale-up the reaction to 100 g
of fish oil FAEEs, which also gave 100% conversion in 1 h. These conditions
are milder than those reported previously8 in all aspects, especially the EH/ester ratio (1.5 instead of 2),
amount of the base (<0.14% w/w instead of 2% w/w), and pressure
(10 mbar instead of 1.5 mbar), thus leading to a more sustainable
method.

Transesterification Reactions
with HD
The optimal conditions for transesterification with
EH, namely, an HD/FAEE molar ratio of 1.5, 90 °C, 10 mbar, and
1 mol % of the base, were applied to the reaction with HD. These conditions
led to little or no conversion at all after 2 h (Table 2, entries 1 and 2). Increasing
the amount of the base to 5 mol % was only successful in the case
of KOH (entry 3).

One possible reason for this behavior
is the higher viscosity of HD in comparison with EH, which may hinder
the correct mixing of the reagents and the basic catalyst. Indeed,
the immiscibility of the reactants has also been noted by other authors
in both esterification36 and transesterification37 reactions. Different types of solutions to this
problem, such as ultrasound irradiation37 or use of a fluidized bed reactor with heterogeneous catalysts at
high temperature,38 have been suggested.
In our case, two strategies were addressed. Thus, first, the temperature
was increased to 120 °C (entry 5) in order to reduce the viscosity
and improve the miscibility of all the reaction components. In addition,
second, tert-butanol was added as a nonreactive solvent
(entry 6) for the same purpose. Both strategies were successful to
the same extent, leading to nearly quantitative conversions after
2 h.

Transesterification Reactions
with Isopropanol
In the case of isopropanol, two difficulties,
namely, the lower reactivity of the secondary alcohol and the similar
boiling points of isopropanol and ethanol, which preclude the use
of vacuum to displace the equilibrium and limit the reaction temperature,
must be overcome. As such, all tests were carried out under reflux
and the amounts of the base and isopropanol were optimized (Table 3).

a Equilibrium conversion
reached after 1 h.

The favorable
conditions for the other two alcohols (5 mol % KOH and 5 equiv alcohol)
were unsuccessful in this case (entry 1), although the conversion
could be increased from 19 to 46% by increasing the amount of isopropanol
up to a limit of 50 iPrOH/FAEE molar ratio (entries
2–4). The main problem seems to be the consumption of the base,
given that the equilibrium could not be shifted by evaporating the
mixture of solvents and addition of new isopropanol. Moreover, the
conversion could be increased up to 90% by using higher amounts of
the base (entries 5 and 6). Finally, significantly improved results
were obtained with EtONa [64% conversion with 5 mol % (entry 7) and
97% conversion with 10 mol % (entry 8)].

Consequently, 10 mol
% of this latter base was chosen for scaling-up of the process for
100 g of fish oil FAEEs (Table 4). Under these conditions, a lower volume of isopropanol was
used in order to reduce the reactor volume required. In the range
of 10–30 iPrOH/FAEE molar ratio, the conversions
reached 86–95% (entries 1–3). Quantitative conversion
was only achieved by using a combination of evaporation of the mixture
of solvents, with addition of new EtONa solution in isopropanol (entry
4, three steps).

The preparation of isopropyl fatty esters has been
described in the literature following a similar procedure but using
triglycerides.13 The authors of this study
used a lower amount of isopropanol (only 55 g per 100 g of oil versus
608 g in our case) but a higher amount of the base (4.8 g per 100
g of oil versus 2.3 g) and a yield of 72% was obtained compared with
89% here.

Enzymatic Transesterifications
Two
commercially available biocatalysts consisting in immobilized Candida antarctica B lipase (CALB) on two different
supports, namely, Novozym 435a (CALB immobilized
on an acrylic resin, an activity of 10 000 U/g) and CalB immo
Plus C-Lectab (CALB immobilized on styrene-methacrylate,
an activity of 9000 U/g), were used.

Transesterification Reactions with EH
In the transesterification
reactions catalyzed by immobilized enzymes, the thermal stability
of the catalysts required the reaction temperature to be limited to
60 °C. The effect of the temperature and pressure was checked
using an EH/FAEE molar ratio of 5, with 5 wt % of Novozym 435 (with
respect to FAEEs). The stirring speed was also limited to 200 rpm
to prevent mechanical damage of the catalyst. Figure 1 shows the slower reaction rate at 30 °C
and the need for low pressure to shift the equilibrium to obtain almost
quantitative conversion after 6 h.

Figure 1 Effect of pressure and temperature on
the transesterification of fish oil FAEEs with EH (5 equiv) using
Novozym 435 (5 wt %).

From an economical point
of view, it would be advisable to reduce the amount of alcohol to
a minimum. Thus, with Novozym 435 (Figure 2), the results were similar or even slightly
better when the EH/FAEE molar ratio was reduced from 5 to 2 or 1.5.
However, use of a stoichiometric amount of EH led to a maximum of
74% conversion. As such, 1.5 was considered to be the optimal alcohol/FAEE
molar ratio.

Figure 2 Effect of the EH/FAEE molar ratio on transesterification
with Novozym 435 (5 wt %). Conditions: 60 °C, 10 mbar, and 200
rpm.

These conditions were also tested
with CalB immo Plus, with the same results (Figure 3), and the amount of catalysts was reduced
to 1 wt % with both enzymes. The reaction was significantly slower
in this case, although a high conversion (>90%) was obtained after
5 h. However, 5 wt % was considered to be the optimal amount of the
enzyme.

Figure 3 Effect of the enzyme amount on the transesterification of FAEEs with
EH (1.5 equiv). Conditions: 60 °C, 10 mbar, and 200 rpm.

Finally, both enzymes were recovered and reused
under the same conditions (Figure 4). Novozym 435 leads to nearly the same results after
the first recovery, but the catalytic activity declines from the third
to the fifth runs. CalB immo Plus does not behave and Novozym 435
after the first recovery, but its activity declines more slowly, with
acceptable results being achieved even after the sixth run.

Figure 4 Reuse of Novozym
435 (top) and CalB immo Plus (bottom) in the transesterification of
FAEEs with EH (1.5 equiv). Conditions: 5 wt % enzyme, 60 °C,
10 mbar, and 200 rpm.

When compared with analogous
processes described in the literature,16 the use of higher vacuum (10 mbar instead of 100–150 mbar)
allows a significant reduction in the amount of immobilized lipase
(5% w/w instead of 15%) while maintaining a fast reaction. Milder
temperature conditions (35 °C), amount of the enzyme (2% w/w),
and no excess of EH, together with the use of atmospheric pressure,
lead to a much slower reaction (50 h for 97% conversion),17 even when compared with our result using only
1% w/w enzyme.

Transesterification Reactions with HD
Given the miscibility problems detected in the base-catalyzed transesterification,
the enzymatic reactions were tested at different stirring speeds and
with addition of tert-butanol as a solvent to improve
the miscibility of the reagents, a strategy already used in the case
of lipase-catalyzed transesterification reactions.39 As can be seen in Table 5, the conversions after 6 h were rather low (<50%)
with 1 wt % of both enzymes (entries 1 and 2). As such, the remaining
tests were carried out with 5 wt %.

a Reaction conditions:
1.5 equiv, HD, 60 °C, and 10 mbar.

In this case, CalB immo Plus showed a significantly
higher activity, leading to 91% conversion (entry 4). The stirring
speed was increased to check the mass transfer limitations, and it
became clear that such limitations exist for both enzymes, given the
acceleration of both reactions (entries 5 and 6) but always with a
clear advantage of CalB immo Plus. A similar effect was obtained when
using tert-butanol as a solvent (entries 7 and 8)
to increase the miscibility of the reagents. Under these conditions,
both enzymes behave in a similar manner; therefore, the differences
observed in the absence of a solvent may be because of the different
hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity of the support. Thus, the more hydrophobic
support of CalB immo Plus (styrene–methacrylate) seems to be
more suitable for a highly hydrophobic reaction medium, such as that
of FAEEs and a large alcohol. The role of the hydrophobic character
of the supported lipase on the transesterification activity has been
noted by other authors.40 The addition
of tert-butanol is likely to reduce the hydrophobic
character of the mixture, thus meaning that the more hydrophilic support
of Novozym 435 is then as efficient as the other one.

Both enzymes
were recovered and reused in both types of conditions (higher stirring
rate and addition of tert-butanol). The results are
shown in Figure 5.

Figure 5 Transesterification

(○) of: (A) Novozym 435 at 400 rpm.; (B) CalB immo Plus at
400 rpm.; (C) Novozym 435 with tBuOH; and (D) CalB
immo Plus with tBuOH.

In all cases, both enzymes behave better than they did in the transesterification
with EH, thus indicating the effect of the alcohol41 on the activity and the recoverability of the enzymes.
At 400 rpm, recoveries of Novozym 435 (Figure 5A) were slightly better than those for the
fresh enzyme, whereas with CalB immo Plus (Figure 5B), the behavior was the opposite, with slightly
lower performance after reuse, but with a stable behavior. Stability
improved yet further when tBuOH was added as a cosolvent
(Figure 5C,D).

Transesterification Reactions with Isopropanol
As in the case of the base-catalyzed transesterifications, reactions
were carried out at atmospheric pressure with a large excess (50 equiv)
of isopropanol (Table 6). CalB immo Plus was slightly more efficient than Novozym 435, giving
78% conversion after 24 h. This result was not improved by distillation
of the mixture of solvents and addition of new isopropanol, which
seems to indicate a deactivation of the immobilized lipase, an effect
described for small alcohols, such as methanol or ethanol,42 and which is still being studied.43 A higher stirring speed produced a decrease
in the conversion, probably because of mechanical attrition of the
immobilized enzyme. As such, the enzymatic approach is less efficient
than the chemical one for transesterification with isopropanol.

Economic Considerations
Apart from the chemical results, the choice of one or another synthetic
method for production requires an economic estimation of the production
costs that take into account the cost of reagents, catalysts, and
cosolvents (if any) and energy costs.15 For this purpose, the cost of transforming 1000 kg of waste fish
oil FAEEs was calculated by the management control department of Solutex,
taking into account direct costs, including reagents and catalyst
costs (considering the possibility of reuse in the case of immobilized
lipases), energy costs (gas, electricity, vapor, and water) associated
with the type of the reactor, heating temperature, vacuum pumps, and
operating time and separation and analytical procedures and workforce.
The results of this evaluation are gathered and shown in Table 7.

Table 7 Cost Evaluation for the Different Transesterification Methods for
Synthesizing Esters from Waste Fish Oil FAEEs (1000 kg Scale)

 	enzymatic	tert-Butanol	7.74	
isopropanol	chemical (EtONa)	 	2.85	
 	enzymatic	 	8.47	
As can be seen, the costs for the synthesis of EH
esters are very similar for all methods; therefore, the choice of
which method to use is likely to be defined by other industrial variables
based on the company’s activities, such as use of the catalyst
in other processes or safety considerations. In the case of HD esters,
it is clear that the use of tert-butanol as a cosolvent
is a key parameter that makes the procedure economically less attractive.
Production using the enzymatic method is less cost-effective, despite
the recoverability of the enzyme, although the impact of tert-butanol on the final cost is lower. Finally, the low yields obtained
with isopropanol when using the enzymatic method make this system
significantly more expensive than the chemical method using EtONa.

Properties of the Fatty Esters
One of the possible uses
of these fatty esters is as lubricants. Thus, the physical properties
of the mixtures, mainly viscosity and its change with temperature
(viscosity index), together with others, such as pour point and flash
point,44,45 were measured and compared with those for
the starting mixture of ethyl esters (Et). In the case of 2-hexyl-1-decyl
esters, the mixture obtained was a solid at 40 °C; hence, the
properties were not determined. The results are collected and represented
in Table 8, together
with their classification according to their kinematic viscosities
(ISO-VG), which affects the possible applications.

As expected, the presence of branched
alkyl groups from the alcohols used increases the kinematic viscosity
values, especially in the case of 2-ethyl-1-hexyl, with values in
the range of ISO-VG 10, whereas isopropyl reaches only ISO-VG-5.

When compared with EH esters of plant origin, the kinematic viscosity
of the esters from waste fish oil at 40 °C is significantly higher.
In the case of vegetable oils, values range from 7.8 cSt for esters
from rapeseed oil17 up to 8.9 cSt for esters
from sal fat oil,46 with values close to
8 cSt for esters from rubber seed oil6 and
palm oil8 also being reported. However,
the kinematic viscosity at 100 °C is similar in all cases (2.5–3
cSt).

In the case of isopropyl esters, the literature data are
less complete and only a couple of kinematic viscosity values at 40
°C, close to the value of 4.95 cSt for waste fish oil esters,
have been reported.3,47

The viscosity values of
these esters appear to make them suitable for applications such as
drilling fluids, spindle bearings, precision grinders, or low pressure
hydraulic systems. However, further studies, including thermal and
oxidation stability, would be required to assess their usability.

Conclusions
Two types of transesterification methods, namely,
base catalysis and biocatalysis with immobilized lipases, have been
optimized for the transformation of waste fish oil fatty esters with
branched alcohols. The comparison of both methodologies shows that
the most efficient method depends on the nature of the alcohol. The
base-catalyzed transesterification is clearly more efficient in the
case of isopropanol. On the contrary, the lipases are more efficient
in the case of the larger HD, given that they are easily recycled
and reused without the loss of activity for at least eight runs. Both
methods are efficient with EH, but immobilized lipases progressively
lose activity upon recycling and reuse. Additionally, the economic
estimation of the processes indicates that the enzymatic transesterification
is only competitive in the case of EH, whereas the chemical transesterification
is more favorable with the other two alcohols. Overall, this comparison
shows the possibility to choose a chemical or an enzymatic pathway
depending on the alcohol needed to carry out the transesterification,
focusing on the possible applicability of the products. Regarding
the possible applications, isopropyl and 2-ethyl-1-hexyl esters show
interesting properties as potential biolubricants, whereas 2-hexyl-1-decyl
esters are solid at room temperature and therefore other applications
working at higher temperatures could be more suitable.

Experimental
Section
Base-Catalyzed Transesterification Reactions
All the
reactions were carried out in two-neck round-bottom flasks equipped
with a septum in the side neck and a reflux condenser connected to
a cooling circuit (15 °C). The reactants were heated with silicone
oil baths at the reported temperature. In the case of reactions at
low pressure, the upper side of the reflux condenser was connected
to a vacuum pump and a manometer, with a liquid N2 trap
to condense the vapor before the pump.

Reaction with EH
The reaction was carried out with a 150:100:1 alcohol/FAEE/base molar
ratio. A mixture of 0.1 mmol base (KOH, EtONa, or TBD), 1.98 g of
EH (15.18 mmol), and 3 g of fish oil FAEEs (10.12 mmol) was stirred
at 1500 rpm and 90 °C under vacuum (10 mbar). Aliquot samples
were taken at different reaction times and they were analyzed by gas
chromatography until total conversion was reached. The crude was diluted
with water (10 mL), and HCl (35 wt %) was added drop wise until neutral
pH. The aqueous phase was extracted with CH2Cl2 (4 × 10 mL), the combined organic phases were dried with anhydrous
MgSO4 and then filtered, and the solvent and the excess
of alcohol were eliminated under reduced pressure. The yield was 84(±2)%
in all the cases, irrespective of the base used. The same result was
obtained after scaling-up this method to 100 g of FAEEs.

Reaction
with HD
The procedure was the same as described above, using
0.1 mmol KOH or 0.5 mmol EtONa as a base. Additionally, the reaction
temperature had to be increased to 120 °C or tert-butanol (5 mL) was added in the reaction at 90 °C. The excess
of alcohol was eliminated by filtration through a silica pad and washing
with hexanes. The yield was 73(±2)% in all the cases, irrespective
of the base used.

Reaction with Isopropanol
As vacuum
cannot be used, the experimental procedure was different from the
procedure described above. The isopropanol/FAEE/EtONa molar ratio
was 5000:100:10. A solution of 68.8 mg of EtONa (1 mmol) and 3 g of
fish oil FAEEs (10.12 mmol) in 38.5 mL of isopropanol (500 mmol) was
stirred at 1500 rpm under reflux for 1 h. After evaporation of the
solvents, the crude was neutralized and extracted as indicated above.
The yield was 88%.

The same procedure was followed for the scaled-up
reaction with 100 g of fish oil FAEEs, using 2.32 g of EtONa and 478
mL of isopropanol (molar ratio 3000:100:10). To get full conversion
of FAEEs, the reaction was started with an isopropanol/FAEE/EtONa
molar ratio of only 1000:100:5 (160 mL of isopropanol and 1.16 g of
EtONa). After 1 h under reflux, the mixture of solvents was evaporated
under vacuum and a solution of 1.16 g of EtONa in 160 mL of isopropanol
was added. After 1 additional hour under reflux, the solvents were
again evaporated and another solution of EtONa in isopropanol was
added. The final FAEE/EtONa molar ratio was then 100:15. After 1 h
under reflux, the solvents were evaporated under vacuum and the reaction
mixture was neutralized as described above. The yield under those
conditions was 89(±1)% (average of three reactions).

Enzymatic Transesterification Reactions
Reaction with EH
A mixture of 150 mg of the immobilized enzyme, 1.98 g of EH (15.18
mmol), and 3 g of fish oil FAEEs (10.12 mmol) was stirred at 200 rpm
and 60 °C under vacuum (10 mbar). Aliquot samples were taken
at different reaction times and they were analyzed by gas chromatography
until total conversion was reached. The enzyme was filtered off and
washed with acetone (15 mL). The acetone and the excess of alcohol
were eliminated under reduced pressure. The yield was 89(±2)%
(average of three reactions with each enzyme). The enzyme was dried
and reused under the same conditions.

Reaction with HD
The procedure was the same as described above, but the stirring rate
was increased to 400 rpm, or tert-butanol (5 mL)
was added when stirring was kept at 200 rpm. After filtering and washing
of the enzyme, the crude was filtered through a silica pad and washed
with hexanes to eliminate the excess of alcohol. The yield was 76(±2)%
in all the cases.

Reaction with Isopropanol
A mixture
of 150 mg of the immobilized enzyme, 3 g of fish oil FAEEs (10.12
mmol), and 38.5 mL of isopropanol was stirred at 200 rpm and 60 °C
for 6 h. After that time, the isopropanol/ethanol mixture was distilled,
38.5 mL of isopropanol was added, and the reaction was stirred under
the same conditions for 18 h. The reaction mixture was treated as
described above to obtain 80% conversion of the FAEEs (single reaction).

Chromatographic Methods
The chromatographic analysis
of the reactions was carried out using Agilent 7890A and 6890 chromatographs
with flame ionization detectors and ZB-5HT Inferno (30 m × 0.25
mm × 0.25 μm) columns. The diluted (dichloromethane) samples
were injected at 250 °C with a split ratio of 30:1 and a column
head pressure of 24.7 psi (carrier He). The detector temperature was
280 °C. As the conversion was similar for all the FAs, the results
were taken from the areas of the palmitates. The full chromatograms
are collected and are shown in the Supporting Information.
