In
this paper, we report detailed experimental observations of
unusual changes in the thickness of solid poly(N-isopropylacrylamide)
(PNIPAM) ultrathin films, which are well known to have temperature-responsive
hydrophilic–hydrophobic switching properties. To date, a number
of studies have been carried out on the bulk and the brush forms of
PNIPAM in contact with liquid water, as well as in highly humid environments,
and, recently, these ultrathin films have been preliminarily shown
to exhibit temperature responses even under low-humidity, ambient
conditions. In this work, the thicknesses of ultrathin PNIPAM films
in a temperature/moisture-controlled sample stage were monitored continuously
using multichannel X-ray reflectometry. At room temperature, the sample
thickness showed an unexpected increase after thermal treatment at
70 °C for 3 h. In the temperature cycle between 15 and 60 °C,
heating and cooling resulted in some clear differences. During cooling,
initially, the thickness was almost constant but began to increase
when the temperature exceeded 33 °C, which corresponds to the
lower critical solution temperature (LCST). This observation indicates
that the PNIPAM ultrathin film is sensitive to the small amounts of
water contained in the air, even under ambient, low-humidity conditions.
On the other hand, during heating run from 15 to 60 °C, the humidity
dependence was monotonic, and no specific changes in the PNIPAM films
were observed at around the LCST. By studying the humidity dependence,
we found that the hydrophilic and hydrophobic states of the PNIPAM
ultrathin film exhibit different temperature dependence behaviors.
In addition, we found that swelling takes place even under low-moisture
conditions. To understand the difference in the thickness changes
observed on cooling and heating further, some models considering the
effect of the boundary conditions in the polymer ultrathin film system
were considered. In the case of the ultrathin film, the hydrophilic/hydrophobic
switching property occurred only in the surface layer, which dominated
the absorption of water molecules from air. In contrast, the interface
layer was time-stable and provided an escape route for water molecules
during heating.

Introduction
Polymers have a wide
range of properties. Recently, the application
of ultrathin polymer films has received significant attention.1−6 However, only a few researchers have realized that there are substantial
changes on moving from the bulk to ultrathin films; specifically,
the contribution of the surface layer to the interface layer in the
system gradually increases, and, consequently, knowledge of the bulk
system is not applicable to the thin-film system because the kinetical
and dynamical behavior of the polymer chains can be quite different
within the thin-film boundary conditions.7−10 Over the past decades, many abnormal
phenomena have been observed in polymer ultrathin film systems, such
as the shift of the glass transition temperature (Tg),11−14 dewetting in the glassy state,15,16 and even negative
thermal expansion.17−22 The above phenomena seem unbelievable at first, but they have been
explained well based on the different structures and properties of
the surface and interface of thin films. For example, concerning the
well-known shift in the Tg of ultrathin
polymer films, it has been shown that the distribution of Tg values is related to the mobility of the polymer
chains with film depth.23−29 Near the surface of the polymer film, the polymer chains have a
high degree of freedom for movement, but near the interface of the
polymer film and the substrate, the polymer chains are constrained
by the interfacial interactions. Under certain conditions, various
anisotropic structures and properties might exist in one polymer ultrathin
film simultaneously, resulting in new behavior that is dependent on
the microenvironment.

Poly(N-isopropylacrylamide)
(PNIPAM) is one of
the most attractive thermoresponsive polymers and shows a sharp lower
critical solution temperature (LCST)-type transition at around 33
°C, which has been widely studied in the aqueous environment.30−32 Concerning the discussion of the mechanism of LCST-type transitions
of PNIPAM aqueous systems, it is generally accepted that the Gibbs
free energy change arising from the competition between enthalpy and
entropy terms can be explained by the changes in hydrogen bonding
and hydrophobic interactions with temperature.33,34 However, the further study of the hydrogen bonds during the phase
transition processes in PNIPAM has revealed that the LCST transition
is more complicated. The hydrogen bonds involved in the LCST transition
are not only hydrogen bonds between water and the polymer but also
hydrogen bonds between polymer chains, as well as hydrogen bonds between
water molecules,35−41 which exhibited the different temperature dependence. In other words,
the transition ability of PNIPAM would be affected by the water amount
in the surrounding environment. In studies of the PNIPAM brush system,
a broadening and shift of the LCST of PNIPAM have been reported under
various conditions.42−47 Unlike pure aqueous systems, the mobility of the polymer chains
and the hydrogen bonding are significantly influenced by the brush
grafting density and the concentration of salt in the solution. Meanwhile,
the phase transition behavior of PNIPAM has been also observed in
thin-film systems in environments saturated with water vapor. Müller-Buschbaum
and co-workers have investigated the PNIPAM-based copolymer thin-film
system extensively48−53 and found that the PNIPAM-based copolymer thin film can absorb and
store water from the air, thus causing swelling. In addition, a nonlinear
thickness change has been confirmed on heating during the hydrophilic–hydrophobic
transition; this is proposed to be influenced by the shape of the
polymer chains.

In our previous study,54 the thermoresponsive
behaviors of PNIPAM ultrathin films under low-humidity, ambient conditions
were studied. It has been preliminarily found that the ultrathin films
exhibit some temperature response even without a large number of water
molecules near the surface. This work is a further extension of that
work. Unlike related studies investigating thin films under saturated
water vapor conditions, our study involves ambient conditions, which
could result in more complicated effects but are more practical because
the low-moisture conditions not only limit the amount of bound water
in the system but also affect the swelling state of the polymer. Studies
of the swelling of polymer thin films with solvent vapor have shown
that the state of the polymer can change dramatically with small changes
in relative humidity (RH).55−59 When the humidity is high (>70–75%), the free volume of
the
glassy polymer expands with swelling, corresponding to the equilibrium
isotherm of the rubbery state following the Flory–Huggins model.

In our experiments reported here, the changes in the thickness
of the PNIPAM ultrathin films with temperature were studied using
different strategies. The main experiments involved a customized multichannel
X-ray reflectometer60−62 based on Naudon’s method.63 This device provides essentially the same information as
conventional X-ray reflectivity measurements based on θ/2θ
scanning, including average layer structure information (such as thickness,
roughness, and density) in the z-direction,64,65 but simultaneous data collection can be realized in an extremely
short time without any scanning or motion of the instrument. During
discrete monitoring, the thicknesses of the PNIPAM ultrathin film
were recorded over 2 months. Continuous recovery and increases in
the thickness of the PNIPAM ultrathin films were observed after each
individual heating treatment at 70 °C for 3 h. Meanwhile, an
asymmetric change in the thickness of the PNIPAM ultrathin film was
observed on temperature cycling between 15 and 60 °C using operando
monitoring. In the cooling process, the thickness of the PNIPAM ultrathin
film was initially stable but then abruptly increased with decreasing
temperature. In contrast, in the heating process, the thickness of
the PNIPAM ultrathin film monotonically decreased with increasing
temperature. To clarify the contributions of different kinetic processes,
moisture control monitoring and long-term monitoring were conducted.
We have determined that there are changes in the thickness of the
PNIPAM ultrathin film resulting from the sorption of water and the
phase transition of PNIPAM, although this asymmetric behavior was
determined based on only thermal treatment at ambient conditions with
finite-time observation. Finally, a model is postulated based on the
inhomogeneity in the polymer ultrathin film system: in our model,
the surface layer and interface layer have different phase transition
properties, and this difference results in asymmetrical behavior during
temperature cycling.

Results and Discussion
Thickness Increases during
Discrete Monitoring
Discrete
monitoring of PNIPAM ultrathin films (approximately 37 nm thick) under
room-temperature conditions for 2 months confirmed a continuous increase
in film thickness with repeated heating at 70 °C for 3 h. Figure 1A shows some of the
discrete raw reflectivity data (each pattern is offset), and Figure 1B shows the calculated
thicknesses of the PNIPAM ultrathin film obtained over the 2 month
monitoring period. Clear Kiessig fringes can be seen in the X-ray
reflectivity curves in Figure 1A, and the frequency and amplitude of these provide information
about the PNIPAM ultrathin-film layer structure. A comparison of X-ray
reflectivity curves a–e in Figure 1 (1st–54th day) reveals the shift
in the minimum of each oscillation toward lower angles, which indicates
an increase in the thickness of the single layer structure. In addition,
the amplitudes of these oscillations, which are generated by the interference
of X-rays reflected from the surface and interface, are stable, implying
that the sample was stable, even after several thermal treatments
over 2 months. In Figure 1B, an increase in thickness can be observed in the first 5
days. Subsequently, the sample was heated at 70 °C for 3 h and
then allowed to cool to room temperature. The thickness of the PNIPAM
ultrathin film was observed to decrease suddenly just after cooling
but, then, continued to increase from the 5th to the 8th day. The
same thermal treatment process was repeated six times in 2 months,
and the same trend in changing thickness was observed. Meanwhile,
on the basis of the data from the 8th day to the 15th day and the
22nd day to the 29th day, the trend in the thickness increase of the
PNIPAM ultrathin film was nonlinear with time. The rate of increase
in thickness gradually reduced with time but accelerated after the
next thermal treatment. After these experiments, a thickness increase
of nearly 16% was observed for the ultrathin PNIPAM films over 2 months.
No doubt, this unexpected increase in thickness cannot be caused only
by the structural relaxation of the polymer thin film itself, and
we propose that this phenomenon may responsible for the swelling in
ambient conditions and the memory effect with thermal treatment may
also contribute to the thickness increase by 16%. However, since the
data collected in this monitoring is not detailed enough, we cannot
further discuss on this hypothesis. Therefore, the control experiments
have been conducted in the following work.

37 nm) on the 1st day (a), 4th day (b), 15th day (c), 29th day (d),

magnified X-ray reflectivity data with the exit angles. (B) Thickness

plotted with a solid line.)

Asymmetric Thickness Change with Temperature Cycling Operando
Monitoring
To reveal the thickness change with temperature
under ambient conditions further, operando monitoring of the thickness
of the PNIPAM ultrathin film (approximately 29 nm) with temperature
cycling between 15 and 60 °C was carried out. In this experiment,
an asymmetric change in the thickness of PNIPAM ultrathin films was
observed with cooling and heating under ambient conditions. In Figure 2A,B, the thickness
of the PNIPAM ultrathin film and the related temperature profile are
presented with time. In the cooling process, the initial thickness
of the PNIPAM ultrathin film was stable at around 28.9 nm, showing
oscillations of only 0.1 nm initially, but it abruptly increased with
further cooling. When the temperature reached 15 °C, the thickness
had increased by 0.9 nm. In the heating process, the thickness just
decreased monotonically, and it reached the original thickness of
28.9 nm when the temperature was 60 °C. The first derivatives
of the thickness with increasing temperature are presented in Figure 2C,D. In the cooling
process, the slope was stable around zero first and, then, gradually
decreased as the temperature fell below 35 °C. In contrast, in
the heating process, the slope was stable, approximately −0.02
nm/°C. Undoubtedly, a transition of the PNIPAM ultrathin film
occurred at around 35 °C in the cooling process, and it disappeared
on heating. Of course, the asymmetric behavior of the polymer material
with cyclic treatment might be interpreted as the hysteresis of the
polymer chains.56,58 However, in this experiment,
the actual kinetic process may be much more complicated. The transition
between the hydrophobic state and hydrophilic state may happen in
the PNIPAM ultrathin film, even though it disappeared during the heating,
and if swelling can happen in the PNIPAM ultra film, the thickness
increase during cooling can be reasonably interpreted. However, in
experiments under ambient conditions, the significant factors are
always more complicated than we think, e.g., even though RH in the
ambient conditions is stable, the actual RH experienced by the surface
of the sample can still change with the temperature, which decided
the swelling process. Therefore, to clarify the temperature contribution
to the unusual thickness change in ambient conditions, the moisture
control experiments have also to be solved out.

Humidity Dependence of Thickness in Moisture Control Monitoring
In this section, the kinetics of the thickness change in the PNIPAM
ultrathin film (approximately 28 nm) was studied with varying RH at
20 °C. In Figure 3A, the change in the thickness of the PNIPAM ultrathin film with
time is shown with RH change from 5 to 75%. From the start of the
measurement to the 9th min, the PNIPAM ultrathin film was kept with
an RH of 5% and was stable. However, as the RH changed from 5 to 75%
at the 9th min, a significant and immediate thickness change was observed.
The thickness of the PNIPAM ultrathin film increased from 27.5 to
31.2 nm in 3 min, subsequently decreasing to 30.3 nm over the next
15 min. Finally, the thickness stabilized. Clearly, the PNIPAM ultrathin
film is extremely sensitive to moisture at 20 °C, and this is
likely responsible for the thickness increase observed in the previous
experiment. The thickness of the PNIPAM ultrathin film can increase
with swelling at low temperature. On the other hand, on changing the
moisture contents, the swelling can be divided into three different
kinetic processes: condensation, diffusion, and rearrangement.72,73 The first two processes can occur in less than 15 min, even with
large changes in RH from 5 to 75%. Therefore, it is proposed that
all data collected in the previous experiments, in which the RH changed
only slightly, correspond to the rearrangement stage.

Figure 3 (A) Thickness change
(calculated by the FT method) of the PNIPAM
ultrathin film (approximately 28 nm) with time as the RH was changed
from 5 to 75% at the 9th min. (B) Thickness change (calculated by
the FT method) of the PNIPAM ultrathin film with RH scan from 5 to
80%. After the first scan, the RH was reset to 5% and the temperature
was changed to 20 °C immediately. The interval between the two
scans was more than 24 h.

In the subsequent experiments, the humidity dependence of
the PNIPAM
ultrathin film was further studied in different states. In Figure 3B, the thicknesses
of the PNIPAM ultrathin film are shown at RH from 5 to 80% at 20 and
42 °C. As shown in Figure 3B, when the temperature was 42 °C, the thickness increased
slightly from 29.5 to 30.3 nm as the RH increased from 5 to 80%. After
resetting the RH at 20 °C for 24 h, the thickness decreased but
did not recover to its original value, remaining at 30.3–30.1
nm. Furthermore, during the second RH scan at 20 °C, the thickness
increased slightly from 30.1 to 30.8 nm with the increase in RH from
5 to 45% and then abruptly increased and reached saturation from 30.8
to 33.6 nm with an increase in RH from 45 to 80%. As summarized in Table 1, a comparison of
the coefficient of thickness increase with RH leads us to some comprehensive
conclusions. The swelling at 20 °C is much more efficient than
that at 42 °C. In addition, at 20 °C, the swelling under
low-moisture conditions is significantly different from that under
high-moisture conditions.55−59 Considering that the uncertainty in measurements is as small as
0.08 nm, it can be proposed that the PNIPAM ultrathin film showed
hydrophobic/hydrophilic transition behavior with temperature. Meanwhile,
unlike the dramatic thickness change under high-moisture conditions,
the swelling of the PNIPAM ultrathin film seems to be insensitive
to changes in RH under low-moisture conditions.

Now, it is clear that the thickness change of the
PNIPAM ultrathin
film with temperature can be related to the swelling of PNIPAM; meanwhile,
the swelling ability can change with temperature, which affects the
hydrophobic/hydrophilic state of PNIPAM. Finally, to clarify whether
the asymmetric thickness change is caused by the actual RH experienced
by the sample, which can change with temperature in the ambient conditions,
the thickness change of the PNIPAM ultrathin films with temperature
was further studied under the moisture control. As shown in Figure 4, operando experiments
were conducted again at RH of 5% and 20% in the moisture control chamber
and at 20% RH under ambient conditions. As shown in Figure 4A,B, at a low RH of 5%, the
thickness of the PNIPAM ultrathin film was stable with temperature
cycling, whereas, when the RH was increased to 20%, an asymmetric
change in thickness was observed, although the magnitude was quite
small. To confirm this weak asymmetric thickness change in the moisture
control system, the same experiment was repeated at an RH of 20% under
ambient conditions, as shown in Figure 4C, and the asymmetric thickness change was observed
again with a more significant thickness change. Because the actual
RH experienced by the sample will not change with temperature in the
moisture chamber, it can be confirmed that the asymmetric changes
in the thickness with temperature are influenced by moisture, even
at an RH of 20%, but the trend in the asymmetric changes should be
independent of the actual RH experienced by the sample under ambient
conditions.

films (approximately 28 nm) with time during operando monitoring (the
temperature scan is shown in Figure 2B) with RH of (A) 5% and (B) 20% in the moisture control
chamber and (C) 20% under ambient conditions.

Dynamic Equilibrium State of Thickness in Long-Term Monitoring
To confirm whether this asymmetric thickness change is caused by
hysteresis in the rearrangement of polymer chains, the equilibrium
states of the PNIPAM ultrathin film (approximately 29 nm) during heating
were studied using static measurements and different temperature scan
sequences over 1 month. Figure 5 shows the thickness of the PNIPAM ultrathin film and experimental
conditions during the 1 month monitoring period [processes (2) to
(7)]. Figure 6 shows
the thicknesses of the PNIPAM ultrathin film subjected to temperature
cycling in the initial state and the final state [processes (1) and
(8)]. Table 2 summarizes
the thicknesses of the PNIPAM ultrathin film throughout these thermal
treatment processes. As shown in Figure 5, the equilibrium state of the PNIPAM ultrathin
film was dominated by temperature, even at temperatures above 33 °C,
and the RH change under ambient conditions did not affect the swelling
of the PNIPAM ultrathin film during long-term monitoring. After thermal
treatment process (1), as shown in Figure 6A,C, the PNIPAM ultrathin film was kept at
42 °C. In Figure 5A, a slow thickness decrease of the PNIPAM ultrathin film can be
seen over the following 4 days, subsequently becoming stable and being
maintained at 28.3 nm on the 12th day in process (2). In process (3)
on the 12th day, a decrease in the thickness of the PNIPAM ultrathin
film from 28.3 to 28.1 nm was observed with heating from 42 to 60
°C. In aging process (4), the thickness continued to decrease
to 27.8 nm over the following 4 days, which can be considered to be
caused by the rearrangement of the polymer chains, similar to the
observations in process (2). In process (5) on the 16th day, the temperature
of the sample was recovered from 60 to 42 °C, and one important
finding is that there was no significant thickness change with cooling.
In aging process (6), the thickness of the PNIPAM ultrathin film was
maintained from 27.8 to 27.9 nm at 42 °C from the 16th day to
the 29th day, which further confirms the observation that the thickness
of the PNIPAM ultrathin film does not increase with cooling at temperatures
above 33 °C. In process (7) on the 29th day, the sample was heated
again from 42 to 60 °C. The second interesting observation is
that the thickness of the PNIPAM ultrathin film did not change at
all, even though the same procedure as process (3) was used. Finally,
temperature cycling process (8) was conducted again on the 29th day.
As shown in Figure 6, the asymmetric thickness change with the temperature still occurred
in the PNIPAM ultrathin film.

Obviously, there is no significant hysteresis in the
monotonic
thickness decrease with heating, and some irreversible process occurred
between processes (3) and (7). It is proposed that, after the absorption
of water in process (1), some bound water may remain in the PNIPAM
ultrathin film even if the temperature is higher than LCST. Although
it seems to contradict the impression of “hydrophobic state”
that water should be completely discharged, when the concentration
of water is low, these water molecules would mainly bond with the
amide group in PNIPAM and will not contribute to the transition of
PNIPAM from the hydrophilic to hydrophobic state. However, these bound
water molecules can further evaporate in processes (3) and (4) with
temperature, thus causing the thickness decrease. Then, in processes
(5) and (6), the temperature was reduced to the initial value, but
the thickness of the PNIPAM ultrathin film did not change. Clearly,
the film did not absorb any moisture in these 2 weeks. Although this
asymmetric behavior is difficult to explain, it is indeed observed
in the series of experiments in this work. Finally, in process (7),
since the moisture in the film has been already evaporated in the
processes (3) and (4), and no swelling happened in the processes (5)
and (6), the thickness of the PNIPAM ultrathin film has not been able
to further decrease by the evaporation of water. On the other hand,
in Figure 6, it would
be noted that the maximum thickness change observed in process (8)
was much larger than that in process (1). In Figure 6A, the maximum thickness change is only 4.7%,
but, in Figure 6B,
the maximum thickness change is 11.2%, indicating that the absorption
or swelling became easier after the repeated thermal treatments over
1 month. This behavior is similar to that observed in Figure 1B, where the thickness of the
PNIPAM ultrathin film continued to increase after several thermal
treatments, which was presumed to be caused by the memory effect in
the polymer system.

Asymmetric Structure in a Polymer Ultrathin
Film
Finally,
to give the discussion on the asymmetric thickness change of the PNIPAM
ultrathin film with thermal treatments, we propose an effect from
the boundary condition that the mobility of the polymer chain can
be considered different at the surface and interface. Generally, it
is understood that the solid PNIPAM bulk does not show hydrophilic/hydrophobic
transition unless in contact with liquid water. However, in the PNIPAM
ultrathin film, the local transition at the surface of the sample
might become possible due to the free motion of the polymer chain,
which facilitates the formation of hydrogen bonds between the amide
group during the transition from the hydrophilic to hydrophobic state.
As shown in Figure 7, the polymer chains in the surface layer of the ultrathin film are
highly mobile, and, as the temperature rises, these polymer chains
may aggregate with thermal motion to achieve a transition from the
hydrophilic to hydrophobic state. In contrast, the polymer chains
in the interface layer would be further constrained by interfacial
interactions, and the transition would be more difficult than in other
regions. If the PNIPAM ultrathin film is considered by analogy to
be a room that can store water molecules, then the surface layer would
be like an automatic door that can respond to the temperature, whereas
the interface layer would be like an exit that is always open for
evaporation. As shown in Figure 8, in the initial stages of temperature cycling, the
water molecules in the air can be rejected by the hydrophobic surface
layer of the PNIPAM ultrathin film. When the temperature is below
33 °C, the surface layer becomes hydrophilic, and the water molecules
can be absorbed and stored inside the PNIPAM ultrathin film, resulting
in swelling with temperature. In the temperature range between 15
and 33 °C, there would be no difference between cooling and heating,
and the difference observed in the operando monitoring can be explained
by the swelling hysteresis. However, when the temperature increases
above 33 °C, the evaporation of water is suppressed by the hydrophobic
surface layer, but it is possible through the interface layer. Therefore,
two different processes can be observed in the same sample in the
same temperature range.

Figure 7 Conceptual sketch of different properties of
the surface and interface
layers in the PNIPAM ultrathin film system on temperature cycling.
When the temperature is below the LCST, water molecules can form hydrogen
bonds with the polymer chain in the interface layer and surface layer;
when the temperature is above the LCST, the polymer chains in the
surface layer can bond with each other after the evaporation of bound
water, whereas the polymer chains in the interface are constrained.

Figure 8 Conceptual model of the asymmetric thickness
change of the PNIPAM
ultrathin film on temperature cycling. In the initial stages of the
temperature cycling, water molecules in the air are rejected by the
hydrophobic surface layer of the PNIPAM ultrathin film. As the temperature
is below LCST, the thickness of the PNIPAM ultrathin film can change
with absorption and evaporation of water. However, when the temperature
rises above LCST again, the evaporative flow would be still available
only through the interface layer.

Anyway, it should be noted that there is still no experimental
data to support the postulated model directly. However, since there
are few reports on the behaviors of the PNIPAM ultrathin film under
the ambient conditions, we believe that it would be important to give
some logical assumptions about the unknown mechanism, which can point
to the direction in the future.

Conclusions
In
this work, the unusual changes in the thickness of PNIPAM ultrathin
films with temperature have been symmetrically studied using different
strategies. We found that the PNIPAM ultrathin film swells even under
ambient conditions, and this swelling effect can be enhanced by the
memory effect after repeated thermal treatments. Furthermore, two
distinct behaviors were observed on cooling and heating in one temperature
cycle: a swelling process following the LCST transition of the PNIPAM
and a monotonic shrinking process. After control experiments with
RH and time, we confirmed that this asymmetric behavior is not caused
by the fluctuation in the RH at the sample surface or by the complex
swelling kinetics. Thus, low-moisture contents and the boundary conditions
are proposed to have significant effects on the PNIPAM ultrathin film
system. Under ambient conditions, the surface layer and interface
layer are proposed to have different phase transition properties in
PNIPAM ultrathin films, which affects the absorption and desorption
of water molecules in the temperature cycle, respectively, making
the film act like a “smart” pathway for the water vapor
flow. However, the proposed model is controversial because of the
lack of direct evidence, but the unusual findings concerning PNIPAM
ultrathin films reported here indicate the possibility of boundary
condition effects in the ultrathin polymer film systems. In the future,
these stimuli-responsive ultrathin films may have potential applications
based on their asymmetric properties in a microenvironment.

Experimental
Section
Materials and Preparation
Commercial PNIPAM powder
(Mw = 10 000;
Sigma-Aldrich Co.) was used for sample preparation. A 1 wt % solution
of PNIPAM in ethanol (Wako Chemicals, Japan) was used to prepare PNIPAM
ultrathin films on silicon (100) wafers (SUMCO Co., Japan), which
were cut to 15 mm × 15 mm and then cleaned with nitric acid.
PNIPAM ultrathin films of various thicknesses were obtained by spin-coating
(SC-400, Oshigane Co., Ltd., Japan) for 20 s at 3000 and 4000 rpm.
Subsequently, the samples were annealed at 60–70 °C for
at least 3 h under room-temperature conditions.

In this study,
the ambient (room) conditions were stable and maintained at 20 °C
in all experiments. However, although the room RH was kept constant
over short periods, such as 1 day, it fluctuated over the long-term
monitoring period (several months) in the range of 20–50%.
On the other hand, the actual RH experienced by the sample may be
different from the measured room RH and may vary with the temperature
of the sample, e.g., if the average room RH is constant (around 20%),
the actual RH experienced by the sample can vary from 27 to 2% with
the temperature increase from 15 to 60 °C in a rough estimation.

Multichannel X-ray Reflectometry
Multichannel X-ray
reflectometry, which was originally developed in our laboratory, was
used for the operando and long-term X-ray reflectivity measurements.
The experimental setup was equipped with an 18 kW rotating anode copper
X-ray source (typical generator settings: 40 kV and 200 mA; Rigaku).
All incident X-rays (Cu Kα, λ = 1.54 Å) were symmetrically
irradiated on the sample surface simultaneously for all angles and
collected using a multichannel detector (1280 channels with an angular
range of around 30 mrad) without any mechanical motion of the sample
and the detector. In this setup, diffuse scattering can be recorded.
Although the intensity of the diffuse scattering is not very strong
compared with specular X-ray reflection, it slightly deforms the overall
shape of the X-ray reflectivity curve. However, both specular and
diffusely reflected X-rays exhibit the same Kiessig fringes,66 for which the frequency gives the layer thickness.
Therefore, all X-ray reflectivity data were analyzed using the Fourier
transform method67−70 rather than ordinary whole-pattern fitting. It has been reported
that the glass transition temperature (Tg) of PNIPAM can be reduced to room temperature at concentrations
below 80%;71 thus, it is reasonable to
assume that the properties of the PNIPAM ultrathin film do not vary
significantly in our experiments, having a maximum thickness change
of about 10%. On the other hand, it is also generally necessary to
consider the change in the density for the data analysis. However,
for the X-ray wavelength used (Cu Kα, λ = 1.54 Å),
the scattering-length densities of PNIPAM and water are very close.
Therefore, it is possible to use a constant density for the thickness
calculation. The stability and reproducibility of the multichannel
X-ray reflectometry have already been experimentally presented in
our previous work.21,22 The uncertainty of the thickness
determination in the present work has been examined experimentally
(see the Supporting information). After
repetition of enough number of X-ray reflectivity measurements and
the data analysis, the stability and the reproducibility were evaluated
by the mean value and the standard deviation of the obtained thickness.
The uncertainty in the thickness determination is better than 0.075
nm for all cases. Therefore, the thickness changes during the present
research are significant enough, even if the change itself is quite
small.

Moisture Control System
The moisture control system
is an extension of the sample stage of the multichannel X-ray reflectometer
and consists of three main components: a moisture controller (AHCU-2,
Sansyo Co., Ltd., Japan), a sample chamber (4 cm × 4 cm ×
8 cm), and a pump. The moisture controller adjusts the RH with airflow
(humidification flow rate: 5 L/min; dehumidification flow rate: 10
L/min) from 5 to 80 ± 3%. The sample chamber is a semiopen plastic
chamber that allows the airflow to pass in one direction. During the
moisture experiments, the RH is maintained by the stream of the moisture-controlled
air, and the actual RH experienced by the sample surface would be
close to average RH in the moisture control chamber.

Discrete Monitoring
In the discrete monitoring experiments,
the nature of the PNIPAM ultrathin film (approximately 37 nm) was
studied under ambient conditions with discrete thermal treatment.
After annealing, the PNIPAM ultrathin film was kept at 20 °C
for a few days, and the thickness was analyzed using the X-ray reflectivity
technique. After the sample had stabilized, the sample was heated
to 70 °C for 3 h and, then, allowed to cool to 20 °C again.
Then, the thickness monitoring was repeated. In this experiment, the
procedure was repeated six times over the following 2 months. However,
the RH in the ambient conditions has not been recorded in detail in
this monitoring.

Operando Monitoring
For operando
monitoring, the thickness
change of the PNIPAM ultrathin film (approximately 29 nm) was examined
with temperature cycling between 15 and 60 °C under ambient conditions
by multichannel X-ray reflectometry. After annealing, the PNIPAM ultrathin
film was kept on the sample stage at 60 °C for at least 12 h
to stabilize the initial state. Then, data collection was conducted
during temperature cycling between 15 and 60 °C. All temperature
scan sequences were conducted at 3 °C/step, and each step took
9 min, including the temperature-changing stage (about 0.5 min) and
the suspending stage (about 8.5 min). At each step, experimental data
were collected between 4 and 7 min to avoid the effects of temperature
fluctuation. The customized sample stage consisted of a flat copper
block and a temperature control system, which limited the temperature
fluctuation to ±0.1 °C.

Moisture Control Monitoring
For moisture control monitoring,
the kinetics of the change in the thickness of the PNIPAM ultrathin
film (about 28 nm) with RH was studied first. The operando monitoring
was conducted at 20 °C, and the RH was varied from 5 to 75%.
Before the data collection, the PNIPAM ultrathin film was kept on
the sample stage at 20 °C with an RH of 5% for at least 12 h
to stabilize the initial state. Then, continuous data collection was
conducted using multichannel X-ray reflectometry. The acquisition
time for each data point was set to 3 min, and, as the data acquisition
period reached 9 min, the environmental RH was changed from 5 to 75%
immediately. The total measurement took about 90 min.

On the
other hand, the equilibrium state of the PNIPAM ultrathin film was
also studied with RH scans from 5 to 80% at 20 and 42 °C. Like
the above experiments, the PNIPAM ultrathin film was kept on the sample
stage at 42 °C with an RH of 5% for at least 12 h to stabilize
the initial state. During the measurements, the RH was raised every
hour from 5 to 80%, and the X-ray reflectivity curves of the PNIPAM
ultrathin film were recorded every hour after each change in RH. After
the data collection of the PNIPAM ultrathin film at 42 °C with
an RH of 80%, the RH was reset to 5% and the temperature was changed
to 20 °C. After stabilization for 24 h, an identical second scan
was carried out at 20 °C.

Finally, control operando monitoring
experiments were conducted
under different moisture conditions. The change in the thickness of
the PNIPAM ultrathin film was examined again with the temperature
at different RH values (5 and 20% RH in the sample chamber, but 20%
RH under ambient conditions).

Long-Term Monitoring
Finally, for long-term monitoring,
the equilibrium state of the PNIPAM ultrathin film (approximately
29 nm) was studied by multichannel X-ray reflectometry under ambient
conditions over 1 month. The measurements were conducted using the
following strategy: (1) on the 1st day, operando measurements were
conducted from 60 to 15 to 42 °C; (2) the sample was kept at
42 °C for a few days, and the thickness of the sample was recorded
on the 1st, 5th, 7th, 9th, and 12th days; (3) on the 12th day, the
sample was heated from 42 from 60 °C, and the thickness was recorded
before and after heating; (4) the sample was kept at 60 °C for
a few days again, and the thickness of the sample was recorded on
the 12th, 15th, and 16th days; (5) on the 16th day, the sample was
cooled from 60 from 42 °C, and the thickness was recorded before
and after cooling; (6) the sample was kept at 42 °C for nearly
2 weeks, and the thickness of the sample was recorded on the 16th,
20th, 22nd, 23rd, 26th, 28th, and 29th days; (7) on the 29th day,
the sample was heated from 42 from 60 °C again, and the thickness
was recorded before and after heating; and (8), finally, on the 29th
day, operando measurements were conducted from 60 to 15 to 60 °C
again. During the monitoring for nearly 1 month, aside from during
the initial and final cycles, the X-ray source was turned off during
the rest time to avoid radiation damage. Importantly, there was no
mechanical movement of the measurement system over the 1 month measurement
period.
