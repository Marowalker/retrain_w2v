Understanding
spatiotemporal organization in bacteria under an
external AC electric field is not only very interesting from a perspective
of studying assembly and disassembly in a model biofilm but also provides
insight into the intricate role of anisotropic interaction with bacterial
dynamics that can generate interesting complex structures. In the
current study, using confocal microscopy, we demonstrate such complex
assemblies of monodisperse tetrad clusters of Micrococcus
luteus, an environmental bacterium synthesized under
a controlled growth condition. These clusters under the AC field produce
a range of interesting structures such as chains, double helix, and
bundles, which are instantaneously reversible when the field is switched
off. Our studies can provide important insights into the natural organization
of the clustered bacterium (with relevance in biofilm-like states)
and generate strategies for biomaterial fabrication with a switchable
functionality.

Introduction
Self-assembly is ubiquitous
in both materials science and living
cells.1,2 From materials science, we already know
that different types of structural
assemblies can be achieved through a unique control of particle shape,
size, and interaction.3 So far, the majority
of the past studies on self- and directed assemblies have been carried
out using different types of uniform-sized spherical-shaped colloidal
particles as successful model systems.4−8 In recent years, there is growing interest to use nonspherical-shaped
and cluster type colloidal particles as building blocks to study complex
assemblies useful in fabricating functional materials.3,6,7,9,10 Especially, clustered colloids are very
interesting as they can be viewed as colloidal molecules.11−13 If spherical colloids can be modeled as atoms, then controlled aggregation
of colloids into defined clusters can be considered as colloidal molecules.
Molecular interactions and complex molecular assembly can be probed
through the colloidal molecule approach using cluster type particles
as building blocks.

On the other hand, addressing a biological
problem using a bacterium
as the model colloid through the colloidal assembly approach is also
very interesting. Bacterial association and assembly play an important
role in many infectious diseases as in the case of biofilms.14,15 In nature, we can find many bacteria with diverse shapes and sizes,
each differing in their habitat and metabolism.16 Clustered bacteria are also common. So, in this sense,
cluster type bacteria can be viewed as colloidal molecules. However,
most bacteria form random clusters with no particular symmetry (Staphylococcus aureus, some cocci, etc.).17 Even through a synthetic approach, producing
clustered shape bacteria in a large amount with narrow size distribution
is challenging. Uniform clusters are a major requirement for colloidal
self-assembly studies. In this work, we report that using a routine
bacterial culture method in Micrococcus luteus, a large amount of bacterial tetrads with narrow size distribution
can be produced easily.

From a materials science perspective,
the biofilm state can be
considered as a complex fluid.18 Here,
bacteria are analogous to colloids that interact among themselves
in the presence of matrix components (EPS) such as DNA, proteins,
carbohydrates, and lipids. These EPS components generate isotropic
and anisotropic interactions and enable bacterial particles to undergo
complex assemblies.19,20 Structural complexities in bacterial
biofilms can vary from bacteria to bacteria depending upon their complexity
in shape, size, and metabolic properties. The viscoelastic property
of the biofilm exhibits a viscous as well as an elastic response.
So far, the physical interactions between bacteria in the presence
of matrix components resulting in complex assemblies are not very
well understood. Only a few studies exist based on the colloidal assembly
analogy.21−24

In these studies, it has been observed that the bacteria exhibit
liquid crystalline structures in the presence of large-molecular-weight
EPS substances like DNA, which act as a template and produce anisotropic
elastic forces among bacteria.22−24 Template-driven strategies are
not reversible and are extremely difficult to control for the study
of assembly and disassembly. Templates forming chemical moieties are
also usually toxic or non-biocompatible. This limits the ability to
engineer bacteria into living materials with potential applications
in biosensing and biomedicine. In this context, AC electric field
induced anisotropic dipolar interaction is a novel method. It has
been extensively used in the past to study template-free assembly
and disassembly in many different types of colloidal systems5,8,25−29 as well as in living systems such as bacteria,30 virus,31 and algae.32 Since bacteria can be considered as complex
dielectric particles33 with a significant
difference in their dielectric constant compared to the solvent (water),
their response to an electric field is very rapid. The induced polarization
causes individual bacteria to aggregate into formation of large structures
aligned along the field direction. Due to the formation of these field-induced
structures, the suspension exhibits a dramatic change of viscosity
by several orders of magnitude. This property mimics that of an electrorheological
fluid.25 Through the external AC field
approach, high cell density equivalent to that present in a typical
biofilm or biomaterial-like bacterial state can be generated rapidly
from a very low-density bacterial suspension. Our recent studies on
rod-shaped bacteria have already demonstrated interesting types of
liquid crystalline structural organizations under an external AC electric
field.30 Hence, we strongly believe that
studying self-assembly of the clustered bacterium as the model colloid
under an external AC electric field is interesting not only from a
materials science view but also from a biological perspective.

In the current study, we have chosen M. luteus (ML) as a model for the clustered bacterium. M. luteus is a well-established model for studying biofilms and for bioremediations.34−36 Although it is known that M. luteus naturally occurs in symmetric dyads, tetrads, and octads, no detailed
studies are reported in a bulk suspension under controlled growth
conditions. Consecutive cell divisions without separation produce
dyads, tetrads, and other clustered M. luteus structures. The first report of this process of consecutive cell
divisions in M. luteus was in 1978,37 but the phenomenon mediating it was identified
very recently in 2019.38 We observed that
especially tetrad-shaped clusters are quite stable and common in the
stationary phase of M. luteus as we
verified from time-dependent growth studies. Hence, our AC electric
field studies have been carried out using M. luteus bacterial tetrads. Our studies demonstrate that bacterial tetrads
form instantaneously various types of field-induced reversible structures
such as linear chain, bundle/columnar, and ribbon-like helix. It establishes
a clustered colloidal model system to simulate and understand molecular
structures and macromolecular behavior at easily observable length-
and timescales using confocal microscopy. Lastly, strict control over
structural assembly can be kept by varying field strength that demonstrates
both a novel biomaterial fabrication strategy and a means to understand
complex aggregation processes in bacterial clusters.

Results and Discussion
Zero-Field
Structural Ordering and Dynamics
M. luteus was grown under controlled growth conditions,
which are typically used for a bacterial culture (see Experimental Methods). The growth curve was measured by a
UV–vis spectrometer (Cary60, Agilent, USA) at a wavelength
λ = 600 nm (see Figure 1A). Bacterial growth curves are often seen to follow a sigmoidal
profile (S-shape) where the bacterial growth rates are low at the
beginning known as the lag phase, growth is exponential in the intermediate
period known as the log phase, and growth slows down in the final
period known as the stationary phase. Similar sigmoid profiles have
been often seen in the case of nucleation and growth studies and phase
transformation studies in different types of materials.39 This sigmoid curve is very well described by
an exponential model of type G(t) ∼ [1 – exp(−Ktα)],39 where K (h–1) controls the rate of growth and α is the exponent
denoting the dimensionality factor (α = 3 in two dimensions
and 4 in three dimensions). Our sigmoid curve obtained from the bacterial
growth characterization in bulk (three dimensions) is found to be
in very good agreement with the exponential growth model. From the
fitting, K and α were found to be 3.4 ×
10–6 h–1 and 4.4, respectively.

tetrads clusters are spherically approximated and the average hydrodynamic
radius is estimated using dynamic light scattering.

M. luteus undergoing V snapping division lengthens to form poles (division sites)
along one axis
and segregates chromosomes.40 The cell
division process of M. luteus is schematically
shown in the inset of Figure 1. Two daughter cells are arranged around newly formed poles,
which are held in a dynamic equilibrium until the last instant. When
this dynamic equilibrium is breached by mechanical crack propagation,
extremely rapid (millisecond) daughter cell separation occurs.38 This process is distinct from gradual enzymatically
driven cell wall remodeling and division that is widely described
in rod-shaped model bacteria (Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis). Rapid daughter
cell separation produces dumbbell-shaped dyad bacterial clusters with
close synchronization. Further, synchronized division of dyad clusters
produces M. luteus tetrads from dyads
without traversing through a triad stage.

We have collected
cultures at different time points of the growth
phase to look into structural ordering through confocal microscopy. M. luteus shows distinct structural associations
in the lag, log, and stationary phases (see images in Figure 1B). M. luteus initially arranges into linked assemblies of two bacteria like a
dumbbell shape around a 0–6 h growth period (lag phase to early
log phase). As the bacterial cell division proceeds, bacteria divide
in the form of tetrad clusters. The intermediate
phase (from 6 h to late log phase, 20 h) contains mixtures of both
dyads and tetrads as seen from the CLSM images (Figure 1B). In the stationary phase, majority of
bacteria are in the form of tetrad clusters. It should be noted that
these dyad and tetrad clusters are quite stable when exposed to shaking
and even under low-frequency sonication. A closer look into the dimension
of these clusters (see the schematics in Figure 1C) suggests that the center-to-center distance
in dyad bacteria is slightly less than the diameter of single spherical
bacteria due to the occurrence of deformation at the interface of
cell division. Tetrad bacterial clusters show a cuboid-like shape
(see the CLSM image in Figure 1B).

In the next step, we studied the dynamics of dyads
and tetrads
using angle-dependent dynamic light scattering (DLS) at very dilute
concentration at room temperature (20 °C) in order to measure
the translational diffusion coefficient. Their hydrodynamic radius
(Rh) could be determined from these experiments
(Figure 2). The experimental
method and their analysis are detailed in the Experimental
Methods section. Since the measured hydrodynamics radii are
based on a sphere model using the Stokes–Einstein diffusion
equation,30 we have approximated the volume
of dyad (as cylinder shape) to an equivalent volume of a sphere. From
this approximation, the theoretically calculated equivalent radii
for the dyad and tetrad are found to be in close agreement with their
measured hydrodynamic radii. It should be noted that, under the spherical
approximation, the average hydrodynamic radii of the dyad and tetrad
are found to be almost similar and close to 1.75 micron.

equation, the hydrodynamic radius is calculated. (C) Schematic representation
for the electric field setup, where the bacterial suspension is kept
between two coverslips separated by a spacer of thickness 120 microns.
One of the coverslips is coated with a conductive indium tin oxide
(ITO) layer and is etched with a gap of 1.2 mm. The AC field is applied
in the image plane, and under an AC field, tetrad bacteria align along
the field direction in the form of chains.

AC-Field-Induced Structural Ordering and Dynamics
AC
field studies are carried out on the purified bacterial sample collected
from the stationary phase at 36 h, where the majority of bacteria
are in tetrad form. The bacterial samples were purified by washing
several times with Milli-Q water by centrifugation at 3000 rpm in
order to remove the extra polymeric substances and salt contents.
Further deionization was carried out by adding ionic-exchange resins
to the bacterial suspension. Deionization leads to an increase in
the surface charges of bacteria, which is confirmed by ζ-potential
measurement. Under this deionized state, bacteria cells have an effective
ζ potential of −29 mV. The electric field geometry implemented
is shown in Figure 2B, where the electric field is applied in the XY plane, the same as the image plane, and the gap between the electrodes
is kept at 1.2 mm. These field studies are carried out at room temperature
(T = 20 °C) using confocal fluorescence microscopy
(Leica, Germany).

In the first step, we have carried out a frequency-dependent
study at constant electric field strength (E = 0.01
Vrms/μm) in order to find out the frequency regimes
where the field-induced structure formations are stronger. In the
MHz-range frequency regime, tetrad bacteria form elongated chain-like
structures along the electric field direction due to strong dipolar
interaction (see the CLSM images in Figure 3). These structures do not disperse with
decreasing frequency until 500 kHz. Further lowering the frequency,
long chains start to melt around 200 kHz. The decrease in length as
well as width of the chain can be clearly observed in the CLSM image
at a frequency of 100 kHz (see Figure 3). In the low-frequency regime (10–1 kHz), the
dipolar interactions further weaken, and the short chains also start
to melt around 10 kHz. At 2 kHz, almost all chains are found to be
melted. What remain are single tetrad bacteria clusters oriented along
the field direction along with very few chains containing 2–3
tetrads.

Figure 3 2D confocal images of bacterial tetrads at different frequencies
for field strength E = 0.01 Vrms/μm.
The schematic figures on the right side demonstrate the following:
(i) Structure formation in the MHz frequency regime could be due to
dielectric polarization where the major component of the bacterial
body contributes to the polarization. (ii) Structure formation in
the kHz frequency regime could be due to double layer polarization
where surface charges of bacteria contribute to the polarization.

To understand the frequency-dependent polarization
behavior of
bacterial tetrad, it is essential to determine the polarizability
of bacterial tetrads through dielectric spectroscopy and find the
strength of induced dipolar interaction. This study has been planned
as an extension of this work at a later stage. So far, the existing
polarization theories are only for nonclustered bacteria.33,41 Based on this existing polarization theory of AC field, we can only
interpret our results qualitatively. In a deionized suspension, bacteria
have surface charge, which is already evident from ζ-potential
measurement in dilute concentration. This surface charge contributes
to the double-layer potential. In theory, bacterial cells are often
considered as complex dielectric particles, where different components
of bacteria (such as cell membrane, cytoplasm) contribute to the total
polarization.33 It is possible that double-layer
polarization occurs in the low-frequency regime (∼kHz) where
the surface charge of bacteria plays an important role. In the high-frequency
regime (∼MHz), major components of the bacterial cell contribute
to dielectric polarization. In our case, there is a possibility that
the magnitude of the effective dipole moment arising from the dielectric
polarization is much higher than the double-layer polarization (see
the schematic in Figure 3). Hence, the dipolar interaction in the MHz frequency range is stronger
than interaction in the kHz range and is responsible for these elongated
structures. The structures get weaken as we decrease the frequency
to the kHz range due to weakening of the dipolar interaction. So,
we fix the frequency in the MHz range (∼3 MHz) and vary the
voltage in order to look into the details of the structural organizations
as a function of electric field strength.

Figure 4 shows 2D
confocal images of a deionized bacterial suspension containing tetrads
(from the stationary state at 36 h) as a function of electric field
strength, E (=Vrms/μm). At E = 0, bacterial tetrads are diffusive due to Brownian motions
and almost have no structural organization (see the 2D image at E = 0). Since the field experiments are carried out in bulk
using a spacer of thickness 120 microns (≫ diameter of a single
tetrad) and tetrads are also constantly undergoing Brownian motion,
in the 2D view, the tetrads can sometimes look like a dyad or a sphere
also. This will be clarified by looking at the time-series movies
of both dyad and tetrads at E = 0 (see Movies S1 and S2).
With increasing field strength, bacterial tetrads slowly start to
orient along the field direction with their length parallel to the
electric field (see the image at E = 0.0024 Vrms/μm). At E = 0.0035 Vrms/μm, the orientation of tetrads along E is
clearly visible along with formation of short chains containing 2
or 3 tetrads. At this low field strength, there is always a competition
between thermal fluctuation due to Brownian motion and the field-induced
dipolar interaction. Hence, breaking and reformation of chains undergo
instantly at the low electric field strength. Further, slightly increasing
the field strength (E = 0.0059 Vrms/μm),
chain length increases, and more tetrads are present in a chain (see Figure 4). At the same time,
chains are stable against breaking and reformation. The structural
organizations of bacterial tetrads at different field strengths are
presented schematically in Figure 4.

Figure 4 2D CLSM images of bacterial tetrads at low field strengths E (Vrms/μm). The two-headed arrow indicates
the field direction E. Linear chains are formed when
the electric field is applied. The schematic image (right side) demonstrates
the different steps of structure formation with increasing field strength
from top to bottom.

In the high-field-strength
regime, E = 0.008 to
0.01 Vrms/μm at a fixed frequency of 3 MHz, chain
length of tetrads grows along the field direction due to strong dipolar
interaction (see Figure 5A). At the same time, one-dimensional (1D) chains start to associate
sideway (or laterally) to form two-dimensional (2D) structures that
mimic a double helix pattern (see Figure 5). Time-series studies demonstrate that,
once these double-helix-like structures form, they do not dissociate
unless the field is switched off (see Movie S3 and Figure 5B). As
a function of time, the double helix structure grows in width through
association of more chains and forms a bundle type structure (see Figure 5C).

bacterial tetrads at higher field strength E (Vrms/μm), where chain length increases
and simultaneously chain aggregation occurs to form a helix structure.
(B) Zoomed images of the helix structure at different time intervals.
(C) Dissociation of the helix structure when the field is switched
off. (D) Schematics of the formation of the helix and bundles due
to association of tetrad chains.

Association of chains in the lateral direction is a very familiar
phenomenon in colloidal systems under an external AC electric field.3−5 Chains that form along the field direction undergo constant fluctuation
due to the intervening water medium. At any instant of time due to
fluctuation, the chain looks like a wave structure with periodic maxima
and minima (see the schematic in Figure 5D). The attraction between the individual
chains is the sum of individual pairwise dipole–dipole interaction
between spheres in two chains.5 As a result,
the dipolar interaction will be repulsive when the two chains are
in-phase, and the interaction will be attractive at a short distance
when two chains are out-of-phase. Under this attractive interaction,
chains overlap and form aggregates, and the aggregate size increases
as a function of time. Earlier studies on different types of dipolar
spheres have shown that the aggregates of chains form well-defined
ordered lattice structures with square symmetry in 2D (XY plane).5,8 However, in our case, we clearly see a helix
type structure in the initial state of two-chain aggregation, which
later on leads to bundle type containing multiple chains (see the
schematic in Figure 5D). The helix structure also undergoes similar fluctuation like an
individual chain as it can be observed from Movie S3. In the later stage, we also observe that some of these
large bundles span from one side of the electrode to the other side
when the samples are kept for a longer period under constant field
strength (see Figure 6).

Figure 6 2D image of a helix/bundle of bacterial tetrads close to one of
the electrodes, where the chain spanning is observed.

Although the exact mechanism for the formation of this helix
structure
is currently not known, we believe that the attractive/repulsive interaction
coupled with the shape anisotropy and/or patchiness of the bacterial
tetrad could be a possibility for this helix structure formation in
bacterial tetrads under an external AC electric field. Some of the
recent AC field studies using either Janus colloids or binary colloid
mixtures (at different size ratios) have also shown a similar type
of helix structure. Previously, long-range ordered helical lattice
arrangements at nano- and mesoscales required templating, biomineralization,
or physical confinement and capillary force.7,42 Electric-field-driven
assembly enables dynamic self-assembled micrometer-scale helices,
which were not possible through previous methods. It also enables
reversible iterative helix assembly and disassembly that increases
the number of data points available for theoretical/simulation studies.

Conclusions
We have demonstrated assembly of bacteria into
uniform-sized dyads
and tetrad clusters under controlled growth conditions and further
study the self-assembly of these tetrad clusters under the presence
of an external AC electric field. The AC field produces interesting
structures such as chains, double helix, and bundles, which can be
tuned by varying the frequency (from MHz to kHz) and field strength
(E = 0 to 0.01 Vrms/μm) as well,
and this process is also reversible. We strongly believe that these
self-assembled structures from bacterial tetrads actuated by an external
stimulus (AC field) could find use in fabrication of biomaterials
with switchable functionalities. It can also provide a method for
studying assembly and disassembly in future studies on bacterial biofilm
models.

Experimental Methods
Bacterial Growth Curve
M. luteus was procured from MTCC (strain no. 1538).
Fresh liquid media were
inoculated with overnight grown M. luteus culture at 1:100 dilution. Bacteria were cultured in a shaking incubator
at a constant temperature of 30 °C and 150 rpm aeration in 200
mL of nutrient-rich Luria–Bertani broth without antibiotics.
1 mL of bacterial culture was removed at discrete time intervals.
Growth curve progression was estimated by optical density measurement
at 600 nm by a UV–vis spectrophotometer (Cary60). Simultaneously,
a colony-forming unit per mL (cfu/mL) of culture was found out by
plating serial dilutions on LB agar plates. These plates were incubated,
and numbers of colonies were counted. For M. luteus, plates were incubated at 30 °C for 48 h. The growth curve
with respect to time was plotted based on cfu/mL values as it provides
viable cell numbers.

Confocal Fluorescence Microscopy and Image
Analysis
A fixed volume (20 μL) of M.
luteus cultures aliquoted at discrete time points
that represent specific
growth phases (lag, log, and stationary) was stained with the FITC
dye. Dyed samples were deposited on a glass slide with a 120 μm
adhesive spacer. A coverslip was placed over the deposited culture.
The 120 μm spacer enables imaging of the bulk bacterial suspension
without artifacts arising from wall effects.

Imaging was done
with confocal laser scanning microscopy (TCS SP6, Leica Microsystems,
Germany) at 63× magnification. Laser and filters were set for
green fluorescent protein imaging (excitation 488 nm, emission 509
nm). Several images were taken at different positions for each sample.
The average number of cells in each sample, motility (if any), Brownian
dynamics, and clustering were evaluated.

Dynamic Light Scattering
A red laser of wavelength
λ = 633 nm was used for this study. The intensity autocorrelation
function g(2)(Q,t) is measured at different scattering angles θ (see Figure 2A). The field autocorrelation
function g(1)(Q,t) is extracted using the Siegert relation43 as g(2)(Q,t) = 1+ β|g(1)(Q,t)|2, where Q is the scattering vector and relate the scattering angle θ
by , where n0 is
the refractive index of water. The field correlation function was
analyzed by cumulant analysis43 using, where Γ is the average decay rate
and μ2 is the second-order cumulant coefficient and
is related to the degree of polydispersity by μ2/Γ2. The decay rate is directly related to the translational
free diffusion coefficient by Γ = DoQ2 (see Figure 2B). From the slope, we have calculated the
translational free diffusion coefficient Do. Finally, the hydrodynamic radius Rh was derived through the Stokes–Einstein equation, Do = kBT/6πηRh, where kB is the Boltzmann constant, T is absolute
temperature, and η is the viscosity of the solvent.

AC Electric
Field Setup
The AC electric field was applied
by using a setup described in our previous paper.30 Briefly, a function generator and amplifier were used to
provide the AC electric field of required strength and frequency.
A bacterial suspension was held between two ITO coverslips for the
parallel electric field and between a normal coverslip and etched
ITO coverslips for the perpendicular electric field (Figure 2C). Bacteria were imaged with
a confocal laser scanning microscope (Leica SP6 and Zeiss LSM 510).
Data was analyzed with proprietary software and ImageJ.
