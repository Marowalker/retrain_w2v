On the basis of the
reaction between ketene and alcohol groups
to result in an ester linkage and Meldrum’s acid as an effective
precursor of ketene group, a bifunctional aliphatic Meldrum’s
acid compound (BisMA) is synthesized and used as a monomer to react
with ethylene glycol and glycerol for the preparation of linear and
cross-linked aliphatic polyesters, respectively. A 62 and 35 wt %
of biodegradation fraction have been recorded on the linear and cross-linked
aliphatic polyesters after an 8 week biodegradation test, respectively,
to demonstrate the good biodegradability of the synthesized polyesters.
In addition to conventional linear biodegradable polyesters, this
synthetic route also provides a new and convenient method for preparation
of cross-linked biodegradable polyesters. The types of the required
monomers and reaction methods for preparation of the cross-linked
biodegradable polyesters are similar to those used for conventional
thermosetting resins. An integration of biodegradable polymers and
thermosetting resins in polymer chemistry has been demonstrated.

==== Body
1 Introduction
In contrast to common
polymers, biodegradable polymers are attractive
for practical applications and environmental issues.1−3 Biodegradable polymers possessing nontoxic and biocompatible characteristics
are attractive biomaterials suitable for biomedical and bioengineering
application.4,5 Introduction of hydrolytic linkages,
such as esters, anhydrides, carbonates, amides, urethanes, ureas,
etc., to the polymer chains could be the basis of molecular designs
of synthetic biodegradable polymers.1,6 Nevertheless,
this requirement pretty limits the monomers and polymerization routes
required for preparation of synthetic polymers possessing biodegradability.

Biodegradable polyesters could be the most studied biodegradable
polymers.6 Synthesis of biodegradable polyesters
could be achieved with two general approaches.7 One is ring-opening polymerization using cyclic lactones as monomers.
Lactides and the corresponding poly(lactide)s have been widely utilized
in the commercial markets. This family of biodegradable polyesters
has some drawbacks, including limited source of monomers, poor molecular
design flexibility of monomers and polymers, and relatively poor thermal
stability of polymers. The other approach to prepare biodegradable
polyesters is polycondensation using aliphatic diacids and diols as
monomers,8 which provides a relatively
wide window of structure designs to the biodegradable polyesters.
Nevertheless, the low reactivity between aliphatic acids and diols
limits the development of biodegradable polyesters prepared with this
reaction route. As the diversity of biodegradable polymer structures
plays a key factor to their properties, development of new synthesis
routes with high molecular design flexibility is attractive for biodegradable
polyesters.

Ketene is a highly reactive group toward nucleophiles.9 Reaction between a ketene with a hydroxyl group
(as the nucleophile) forms an ester linkage. This reaction potentially
provides an alternative synthetic route for ester compounds and polyesters.
Nevertheless, ketene compounds could not be directly utilized in the
synthetic method due to their high reactivity and less controllability.
As Meldrum’s acid (MA) group is an effective precursor of ketene,10−14 Hawker et al.15 reported a facile synthesis
route of high-molecular-weight aromatic polyesters using MA derivatives
as monomers based on the abovementioned ketene chemistry.

This MA-based synthesis route of polyesters15 inspires our work on synthesis of biodegradable polyesters
with MA derivatives as monomers. To target on preparation of aliphatic
polyesters with biodegradability, a bifunctional aliphatic MA compound
(BisMA) is newly synthesized in this work. BisMA has been utilized
as a monomer to be reacted with an aliphatic diol (ethylene glycol
(EG)) to result in the corresponding linear aliphatic polyester. We
have also demonstrated the synthesis of biodegradable thermosetting
resins by reacting BisMA with a triol (glycerol) through a procedure
similar to the conventional processes for the preparation of thermosetting
resins. On the basis of our best knowledge, this is the first example
of preparation of biodegradable thermosetting resins through the conventional
thermally induced curing processes. The biodegradability of the obtained
polyesters has been evaluated to support the new synthesis route for
biodegradable polyesters.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Preparation of Aliphatic Bifunctional MA Derivative
To introduce biodegradability to synthetic polyesters, fully aliphatic
polyesters are designed and prepared. The first step is synthesis
of an aliphatic bifunctional MA derivative (BisMA) as the monomer.
As shown in Scheme 1, BisMA is obtained from the dehydrobromide reaction between dibromopropane
(DBP) and 2,2,5-trimethyl-1,3-dioxane-4,6-dione (methyl Meldrum’s
acid, MA-M). Spectral characterization of BisMA has been done with
Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, 1H nuclear
magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H NMR), and mass spectroscopy
(Figure 1). In FTIR
analysis, BisMA exhibits specific absorption peaks of MA ring at 1781
cm–1 (−C=O asymmetric stretching),
1740 cm–1 (−C=O symmetric stretching),
and 1050 cm–1 (C–O–C), as well as
absorption peaks of −CH2– groups at 2970
cm–1 (stretching) and 1445 cm–1 (bending). The C–Br absorption, which appears in the spectrum
of DBP at 590 cm–1, is not observed with BisMA.
The above results suggest occurrence of the condensation reaction
between DBP and MA-M and the formation of the expected product of
BisMA. The 1H NMR spectrum of BisMA provides further support
to the successful synthesis of BisMA with the coincidence between
the expected chemical structure of BisMA and the resonance peaks at
δ = 1.18 ppm (−CH2CH2CH2−),
δ = 1.52 ppm (−C(=O)CCH3), δ = 1.65 ppm (−OC(CH3)2), and δ = 1.93 ppm (−CH2CH2CH2−). The molecular
weight calculated for BisMA (C17H24O8) is 356.37 g mol–1, which is matched with the
value (m/z = 357 Da, (M + 1)+) measured with MS. Moreover, elemental analysis reveals that
the obtained BisMA sample has a C and H weight fraction of 57.3 and
6.80%, respectively. Both are highly coincident to the calculated
value of 57.3% for C and 6.79% for H. The results support the chemical
structure and high purity of the obtained BisMA compound.

of BisMA with (a) FTIR, (b) 1H NMR, and (c) mass spectroscopies.

Scheme 1 Synthesis of Bifunctional Aliphatic
Meldrum’s Acid Compound
BisMA
BisMA shows a sharp endothermic
peak at about 210 °C in differential
scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurement (Figure 2), which corresponds to its melting behavior.
The sharp melting peak also supports the high purity of the obtained
BisMA sample. Moreover, this endothermic peak somewhat overlaps with
a relatively small exothermic behavior, corresponding to the thermolysis
of MA groups. Generation of ketene groups with MA thermolysis and
further ketene dimerization reactions takes place at such high temperatures.15 The MA thermolysis reaction of BisMA evolves
one acetone and one CO2 molecule, so as to exhibit a rapid
weight loss at about 220 °C in the thermogravimetric analysis
(TGA) thermogram of BisMA. The results from both DSC and TGA analysis
show good coincidence and support to the proposed reactions. The thermal
analysis result of BisMA indicates that this compound possesses reactive
MA groups for further reactions.

with glycerol using
(a) DSC and (b) TGA instruments.

2.2 Preparation of Polyesters with BisMA
BisMA is utilized as a bifunctional monomer to react with multifunctional
alcohol compounds for preparation of polyesters. The reaction involves
generation of ketene groups through MA thermolysis reaction and formation
of ester linkages by means of the addition reaction between ketene
and hydroxyl groups.15 As hydroxyl groups
have been reported to show effective catalysis effect on MA thermolysis
reaction,15,16 the mixture of BisMA and glycerol might
show a relatively low reaction temperature compared to the neat BisMA,
as demonstrated with the DSC thermograms shown in Figure 2. BisMA/glycerol mixture shows
an endothermic peak at about 160 °C and a following exothermic
peak at about 184 °C in DSC analysis. A similar result is observed
with TGA measurement, in which BisMA/glycerol mixture shows a rapid
weight loss at about 160–180 °C, compared to the temperature
of 220 °C recorded with neat BisMA. As the weight loss temperature
is much lower than the boiling point of glycerol (290 °C), the
weight loss is attributed to the occurrence of glycerol-catalytic
MA thermolysis reaction. Once the ketene groups form with the MA thermolysis
reaction, they react with the hydroxyl groups to result in polyesters.

Linear and cross-linked aliphatic polyesters have been prepared
through a bulk polymerization process with BisMA/EG and BisMA/glycerol
as monomers, respectively (Scheme 2). LP-BisMA/EG shows good solubility in organic solvents
and has a number-averaged molecular weight and polydispersity of 82 000
g mol–1 and 2.2, respectively (Figure 3a). On the basis of its solubility
in organic solvent, LP-BisMA/EG has been characterized with 1H NMR (Figure 3b).
The formation of EG-based ester structure is characterized with the
resonance peaks at about δ = 4.2 ppm corresponding to the −C(=O)OCH2–
groups. Addition reaction of −OH groups of EG to the ketene
groups generated from MA-M thermolysis results in −CH–C(=O)
groups, which result in the resonance peaks at about δ = 1.9–2.0
ppm. The resonance peaks at about δ = 1.1 and 1.3–1.6
ppm are assigned to the −CH3 group and the methylene groups of −CH2–CH2–CH2– segments,
respectively. Because of possessing a cross-linked structure, CRP-BisMA/glycerol
is not soluble in organic solvents. A high gel fraction of 95% has
been measured with CRP-BisMA/glycerol in toluene. Moreover, CRP-BisMA/glycerol
shows a glass transition temperature of about −16 °C (tan δ)
measured with a dynamic mechanical analyzer (DMA).

of LP-BisMA/EG.

Scheme 2 Polymerization of
BisMA and Alcohol Compounds for Preparation of
Linear and Cross-Linked Aliphatic Polyesters
Both polyesters have been characterized with FTIR (Figure 4) and show similar
characteristic
absorption peaks of ester linkages at 1730 cm–1 and
−CH2– groups at 2970 cm–1. The MA absorption is not observed with the polyester samples. Moreover,
compared to the linear polyester (LP-BisMA/EG), the cross-linked aliphatic
polyester (CRP-BisMA/glycerol) prepared with BisMA and glycerol shows
a relatively strong absorption of −OH groups at about 3450
cm–1 (compared to the ester absorption as a reference),
indicating that some unreacted −OH groups of glycerol are remained
in the sample. On the other hand, LP-BisMA/EG shows an absorption
at about 1810 cm–1 corresponding to the C=O
groups of 1,3-butandione, which are formed from the ketene dimerization
reaction. The results suggest that in the polymerization process of
BisMA and EG, ketene might involve in both esterification and dimerization
reactions. For the reaction between BisMA and glycerol, the dimerization
of ketene becomes minor.

Figure 4 (a) FTIR, (b) DSC, and (c) TGA measurements
on linear (LP-BisMA/EG)
and cross-linked (CRP-BisMA/glycerol) aliphatic polyesters.

Both polyesters do not exhibit
obvious endothermic and exothermic
behaviors in DSC measurements (Figure 4), indicating the high conversion of MA thermolysis
reaction in the polymerization processes. Moreover, no crystallization
transitions were observed with these two polyesters, which are similar
to some polyesters reported in literature.15 In TGA measurements, the temperature of 5% weight loss (Td5) recorded on LP-BisMA/EG and CRP-BisMA/glycerol
is 247 and 267 °C, respectively. The degradation patterns of
the two polyesters are also different. Compared to CRP-BisMA/glycerol,
LP-BisMA/EG shows a multiple weight loss behavior and better thermal
stability, although CRP-BisMA/glycerol possesses some cross-linked
structure. As a result, the relatively high thermal stability and
retarded weight loss behavior of LP-BisMA/EG could be attributed to
its cyclic 1,3-butandione structures mentioned in the discussion on
FTIR analysis.

2.3 Biodegradation Tests
The biodegradability
of the prepared aliphatic polyesters is evaluated with a catalytic
biodegradation method. For comparison, a cross-linked polyester possessing
aromatic structures (CRP-Ar-BisMA/glycerol) is also prepared using
Ar-BisMA and glycerol as monomers (Scheme 2). In an 8 week test, the time-dependent
weight fractions of the samples have been recorded and shown in Figure 5. Compared to the
semiaromatic cross-linked polyester CRP-Ar-BisMA/glycerol, both aliphatic
polyesters show relatively high rate and high fractions of weight
losses in the biodegradation tests. The result is reasonable and falls
into the general knowledge. On the other hand, after 8 weeks, the
weight losses found with LP-BisMA/EG and CRP-BisMA/glycerol are 62
and 35 wt %, respectively. Both aliphatic polyesters prepared with
BisMA demonstrate sufficient biodegradation characteristics. The biodegradability
of the linear sample of LP-BisMA/EG is relatively high compared to
the cross-linked CRP-BisMA/glycerol. The weight loss fractions readily
increased with increasing the testing time, which is similar to poly(lactide)s17 and suggests both BisMA-based polyesters perform
a degradation pattern from surface to inner parts. The scanning electron
micrographs (Figure 6) support the results. The smooth surface of CRP-BisMA/glycerol before
biodegradation test becomes rough after a 24 day test due to the biodegradation
erosion. The erosion also generates some porous structure in the inner
part of the sample, indicating the catalytic medium might permeate
into the sample in the biodegradation process. This result is coincident
to the weight loss pattern shown in Figure 5,
in which an increased weight loss rate is observed with CRP-BisMA/glycerol
after 24 days. In summary, the biodegradation of CRP-BisMA/glycerol
starts at the sample surface and is followed by an erosion effect
inside the sample caused by the permeation of the catalytic medium.

3.2 Instrumental
Methods
FTIR spectra
were recorded with a PerkinElmer Spectrum Two FTIR instrument with
a resolution of 4 cm–1 and 16 scans. 1H NMR spectra were obtained with a Varian Unity INOVA 500 NMR (500
MHz) spectrometer using CDCl3 as a solvent. Elemental analysis
was conducted with a Heraeus CHN-O rapid elemental analyzer using
acetanilide as a standard. Mass spectra were recorded with a JEOL
AccuTOF GCX mass analyzer using a field desorption atomizer. DSC measurements
were taken with a differential scanning calorimeter Q-100 instrument
from Thermal Analysis (TA) Instrument Company with a nitrogen flow
at 50 mL min–1 and a heating rate of 10 °C
min–1. TGA thermograms were recorded with a TA TGA
Q-500 instrument at a heating rate of 10 °C min–1 and a nitrogen flow rate of 100 mL min–1. Dynamic
mechanical analysis was carried out with a TA DMA Q-800 instrument
using a three-point bending mode with an applied force of 0.1 N, a
frequency of 1 Hz, and an amplitude of 10 μm.

3.3 Preparation of BisMA
MA-M (2.0 g,
12.66 mmol) and K2CO3 (2.62 g, 19.0 mmol) were
dissolved in dried N,N-dimethylformamide
(DMF, 15 mL). The solution was charged into a 25 mL round-bottom flask.
A solution of DBP (1.22 g, 6.0 mmol) in 3 mL of DMF was added dropwise.
The mixture was then reacted at room temperature (about 25 °C)
for 20 h. After being added 2.0 mL of HCl (aq) (10 wt %), the solution
was extracted with chloroform (20 mL) for three times. The collected
organic phase was dried over anhydrous MgSO4. After removal
of chloroform with a rotary evaporator, the product was obtained with
precipitation from excess toluene (yield: 20%)

3.4 Preparation
of Polyesters
Polymerization
of BisMA (Ar-BisMA) and alcohol compounds was carried out in a similar
manner as reported in the literature.15 For BisMA and EG, a stoichiometric amount of BisMA and EG was charged
into an ampoule. The reaction was carried out at 190 °C for 20
min. The product (LP-BisMA/EG) was dissolved in 6F-isopropanol and
precipitated from excess methanol. For BisMA/glycerol, a stoichiometric
amount of BisMA and glycerol was mixed and poured into a Teflon-coated
stainless mold. The product (CRP-BisMA/glycerol) was obtained after
a reaction at 180 °C for 0.5 h and 200 °C for 0.5 h. CRP-Ar-BisMA/glycerol
was prepared in the same manner using Ar-BisMA and glycerol as the
monomers.

3.5 Measurement of Gel Fraction
A dried
CRP-BisMA/glycerol sample (weight: Wo)
was immersed in toluene for 24 h. After being drawn out the wetted
sample was treated with an oil-absorbing paper to remove the liquid
on the sample surface and then weighed (Wr). The gel fraction (%) of the sample was calculated from Wr/Wo × 100%.

3.6 Biodegradation Test
Polyester thin
films with a thickness of about 500 μm were punched into disklike
samples with a diameter of 7.0 mm. A solution of lipase II (from porcine
pancreas) in Dulbecco’s phosphate-buffered saline (10 U mL–1) was utilized as the degradation medium. Polyester
samples were incubated in the degradation medium at 37 °C for
8 weeks. The used medium was freshly changed every 2 days. The biodegradation
was evaluated with weight measurements on the samples every week.
Samples (three pieces) were washed with distilled deionized (dd) water,
immersed in ethanol and dd water for 24 h, and dried for weight measurement.

4 Conclusions
Multifunctional aliphatic Meldrum’s
acid compounds are effective
monomers for preparation of aliphatic polyesters showing biodegradability
similar to the aliphatic polyesters from other polymerization methods.
The synthetic route demonstrates a high flexibility of molecular designs
of biodegradable polyesters. Moreover, with multifunctional aliphatic
Meldrum’s acid compound and aliphatic triols as monomers, this
preparation method also provides a direct synthesis of biodegradable
cross-linked aliphatic polyesters.18 As
the reaction routes are similar to those for conventional thermosetting
resins, the developed synthesis method shows a good integration between
biodegradable polymers and thermosetting resins.
