The four-step procedure
involving bromination, reduction, and nucleophilic
substitution via elimination/addition previously applied to 1-(2-pyridyl)-2-propen-1-ol
for the synthesis of indolizidine systems has now been extended to
1-(2-quinolyl)-2-propen-1-ol allowing a general access to benzo-fused
derivatives. For instance, (±)-benzo[e]lentiginosine
has been easily synthesized in an 18% overall yield.

Introduction
In 1988, Evans introduced
the term “privileged structures”
to define molecular frameworks “capable of providing useful
ligands for more than one receptor,” which upon modifications
“could be a valuable alternative in the search for new receptor
agonists and antagonists.”1 The
principle of privileged structures has been widely applied for the
design and synthesis of libraries of natural products and their analogues
by planning diversity-oriented syntheses2 to access molecules (often small molecules) with maximum structural
diversity.

Heterocyclic systems and mainly six-membered aza-heterocycles,
including pyridines,3 quinolines,4 and their reduced forms such as 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinolines,5 are privileged structures because they are widely
spread in nature and are well-known for their multifaceted biological
activities as well as for their significant applications in the pharmaceutical
and agrochemical domains.

Moreover, indolizidine alkaloids,
and mainly polyhydroxylated derivatives,
have been recognized as potent and selective inhibitors of glycosidases
and have also been investigated as antibacterial, antiviral, antitumor,
antiinflammatory, or antidiabetic agents.6 In particular, from its isolation in 1990, a noteworthy attention
has been devoted to natural (+)-lentiginosine [(1S,2S,8aS)-octahydroindolizine-1,2-diol]7 as well as to the non-natural enantiomer able
to behave, respectively, as amyloglucosidase and Hsp90 inhibitor or
apoptosis inducer on tumor cells of different lines.8

In this context, we recently reported a facile four-step
synthesis
of rac-lentiginosine from 1-(2-pyridyl)-2-propen-1-ol.9 With the aim to synthesize different analogues
to test their biological properties, we then decided to apply the
same methodology to 1-(2-quinolyl)-2-propen-1-ol (1)10 to access benzo[e]indolizidines
with a tetrahydroquinoline skeleton (Figure 1), assessed as promising targets on the basis
of computational studies.11

Figure 1 General approach to benzo[e]indolizidines from
1-(2-quinolyl)-2-propen-1-ol (1).

Results and Discussion
1-(2-Quinolyl)-2-propen-1-ol (1) was synthesized in
94% yield from 2-quinolinecarboxaldehyde, but the easy isomerization
into the corresponding ethyl ketone10 made
its purification impossible. After isolation, compound 1 was immediately subjected to bromination with a stoichiometric amount
of bromine in dichloromethane at 0 °C, affording a mixture of
diastereomeric trans and cis benzoindolizinium
salts 2 and 3 (1:2–1:3 ratio), recovered
in 97% yield by ensuing multiple filtrations (Scheme 1). The diastereomeric salts cannot be separated
but simple stirring in water at room temperature allowed the total
conversion of the cis isomer into trans-salt 2, which was then isolated in a quantitative yield
(Scheme 1). As previously
observed for indolizinium salts,9 in polar
solvents, the solvent-separated ion pairs in 2 and 3 are likely able to evolve into the more stable trans isomer 2 through the nucleophilic attack of the bromide
ion on C-2 carbon.a

Scheme 1 Bromocyclization
of 1-(2-Quinolyl)-2-propen-1-ol (1)
and Cis/Trans Salt Isomerization
Salt 2 was then
subjected to reduction under different
conditions. The use of NaBH4 led to complex reaction mixtures,
whereas no reduction was observed for hydrogenation in the presence
of Pd/C. On the other hand, hydrogenation in the presence of monohydrate
PtO2 as the catalyst afforded the formation of diastereomeric
tetrahydroquinolines bromohydrates 4 and 5 (Scheme 2).b Compounds 4 and 5 are
completely stable as hydrobromides, but attempts to isolate the bromohydrins
as free bases were unsuccessful.c

Scheme 2 Synthesis
of Oxiranes 6 and 7 by Reduction
of Trans Salt 2 and HBr Elimination
The mixture of 4 and 5 was then subjected
to treatment with aqueous KOH in tetrahydrofuran (THF) affording diastereomeric
epoxides 6 and 7 isolated in 23 and 16%
yields, respectively, by column chromatography (Scheme 2). It is worthy to note that epoxides 6 and 7 are the first products purified after
four reaction steps, then involving an averaged 80% yield for any
single step.

The trans-OH/Br relationship in 4 and 5 is certainly responsible for intramolecular
SN2 reactions leading to oxiranes 6 and 7, respectively, via formal HBr elimination (Figure 2).

Figure 2 Intramolecular SN2 reactions on bromohydrins 4 and 5.

With oxiranes 6 and 7 in hand, ring opening
reactions with different nucleophiles were studied.

When oxirane 6 was treated with aqueous H2SO4 in
THF at 100 °C in a screw-cap tube (see Experimental
Section) for 24 h, a 3:1 mixture of
diols 8 and 9 was recovered in 35% yield
(Table 1, entry 1).

b Isolated yields.

The formation of the reaction products can be rationalized
trough
a totally anti diastereoselective and highly C-2
regioselective nucleophilic attack of water on epoxide 6 (activated by protonation at oxygen and/or nitrogen) (Scheme 3).

Scheme 3 Formation of Diols 8 and 9 from Oxiranes 6 and 7
The separation of
diols was however unsuccessful. The same reaction
was then performed with D2O as the solvent under different
conditions to evaluate the selectivity of the process via 1H NMR analyses. The formation of diol 8 indeed improved
at 60 °C, but the reaction times were too long (Table 1, entry 2), whereas operating
at 80 or 100 °C, the transformation was faster, but the selectivity
decreased (Table 1,
entries 3 and 4).

An analogous study was undertaken on oxirane 7. Operating
in THF at 100 °C, diols 8 and 9 were
isolated in 64% yield as a 1:4 mixture (Scheme 3, Table 1, entry 5). 1H NMR analyses of reactions
performed in D2O showed a higher reactivity for 7, compared to 6, that underwent a total conversion even
at 40 or 60 °C (Table 1, entries 6 and 7). Operating in water at 40 °C, a 1:3.5
mixture of diols was recovered in 72% yield (Table 1, entry 8).d

Reactions of oxiranes 6 and 7 in dry
MeOH, in the presence of conc. H2SO4 allowed
to recover the methoxy derivatives 10–13 in 70 and 11% yields and 67 and 9% yields, respectively (Scheme 4). In this case,
the selectivity is higher and the major isomer derives again from
a totally anti diastereoselective and highly C-2
regioselective nucleophilic attack of methanol on activated epoxides 6 and 7. Small amounts of diols 8 and 9 were also recovered (see Experimental
Section).

Scheme 4 Formation of Methoxy Derivatives 10–13 from Oxiranes 6 and 7
Oxirane ring opening was then
studied with acetic acid as the solvent.
When heated at 60 °C for 3 days, compound 6 afforded
only traces of monoacetates, whereas total decomposition of the starting
material was observed for compound 6 after 48 and 24
h at 80 and 100 °C, respectively, and even for epoxide 7 when heated at 60 °C for 4 days.

Accidentally,
a different pathway was observed operating in AcOH
in the presence of concentrated H2SO4.e Heating compound 6 for 7 h in glacial
AcOH at 60 °C allowed to isolate diacetate 15 in
60% yield along with minor amounts of regioisomeric monoacetates 14a,b (1:1 ratio, 14%) and diol 8 (8%) (Scheme 5).

Scheme 5 Ring Opening of Oxiranes 6 and 7 with AcOH
and H2SO4
By contrast, epoxide 7, under the same conditions
for 36 h, gave a complex reaction mixture of isomeric monoacetates,
diacetates, and diols (1H NMR). Careful chromatographic
separation allowed to recover a 1:3.5 mixture of diacetates 15 and 17 in 30% yield along with monoacetates 14a,b and 16a,b (1:5 ratio, 28%) and diols 8 and 9 (1:2 ratio, 8%) (Scheme 5).

It is worth to note that in the
case of oxirane 6,
all reaction products show the same relative stereochemistry on the
three stereogenic centers as the fruit of totally anti diastereoselective and totally C-2 regioselective nucleophilic attacks
on the epoxide ring. This result can be rationalized considering different
nucleophilic attacks on suitably activated intermediates (Scheme 6).

Scheme 6 Ring Opening of Oxirane 6 with AcOH: Mechanistic Rational
Anti diastereoselective attack of AcOH
on the
C-2 carbon of protonated oxirane 6a affords monoacetate 14a, easily converted into diacetate 15 by esterification.
Compound 15 can also arise from acetylated epoxide 6b via nucleophilic attack of AcOH at position 2, whereas
nucleophilic attack of H2O can give monoacetate 14b. Hydrolysis of all reaction products can produce diol 8.

The same mechanism can justify the results observed for epoxide 7, invoking totally anti diastereoselective
attacks, but in this case, only preferential regioselective attacks
at position 2.

On the basis of these results, running a one-pot
reaction for compound 6, including oxirane ring opening
in AcOH/H2SO4, followed by hydrolysis under
the same conditions allowed
to isolate rac-benzo[e]lentiginosine 8 as the sole reaction product in 82% yield (Scheme 7).

Scheme 7 One-Pot Formation
of rac-Benzo[e]lentiginosine 8 from Oxirane 6
Concerning diol 8, the relative stereochemistry
of
the stereogenic centers was unambiguously confirmed by nuclear Overhauser
enhancement spectroscopy (NOESY)-one-dimensional (1D) experiments
recorded in CDCl3, evidencing dipolar couplings for proton
H-10a at δ 3.32 with H-2 (pseudo quartet at 4.37 ppm) and H-3α
(doublet-of-doublets at 3.68 ppm) (Figure 3).

Figure 3 Dipolar couplings for compound 8 (from NOESY-1D experiments).

As previously evidenced, oxirane ring openings in acidic
water
or MeOH show a higher reactivity for 7 compared to 6, probably because of a more difficult anti nucleophilic attack in the latter for the presence of the nitrogen
lone pair (see Scheme 3). On the other hand, compound 6 showed a higher reactivity
(with total regioselectivity) in AcOH after addition of H2SO4 (complete transformation at 60 °C in 7 h for 6 and in 36 h for 7). This different behavior
could be rationalized in terms of acid–base interactions between
AcOH and the ring nitrogen. This coordination could favor the anti nucleophilic attack only in oxirane 6 because
in compound 7 the nitrogen lone pair is on the same side
with respect to the oxirane bridge (Figure 4). Likely for 6, the same coordination
is also able to direct the nucleophilic attack of AcOH exclusively
at position 2.

AcOH/H2SO4.

Conclusions
In conclusion, these results clearly show the
possibility of a
general application of this new methodology exploiting pyridine-2-carboxaldehyde
derivatives as commercially available starting materials for the synthesis
of pyridyl-2-propen-1-ol systems and conversion into various functionalized
indolizidines through a four-step approach involving bromination/reduction/nucleophilic
substitution via elimination/addition. In particular, the use of 2-quinolinecarboxaldehyde
allowed the synthesis of polynuclear tetrahydroquinolines, well-recognized
as privileged structures with many different applications. For instance,
the tricyclic moiety of benzo[e]indolizidine is present
in naturally occurring alkaloids, such as incargranine B isolated
from Incarvillea mairei var. grandiflora,
a member of the genus Incarvillea, from
which several derivatives with a strong antinociceptive activity have
been isolated (Figure 5).12 Moreover, synthetic tetracyclic derivatives
of type I showed good in vitro inhibiting activity toward
human lung cancer cells, human hepatoma cells, and acute myeloid leukemia
cells (Figure 5).13

a The conversion was almost instantaneous
in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), but the use of water was preferred,
being a green solvent and allowing an easier recovery of the product.

b Minor amounts of fully reduced
products
were also observed via 1H NMR analyses.

c Likely, the presence of an aniline
moiety in the reduction products is responsible for decomposition/polymerization
processes.

d 1H NMR
analyses of the
reaction crudes with D2O as the solvent, for both epoxides,
clearly evidenced the total deuteration at positions 5 and 7, likely
an aromatic electrophilic substitution activated by the aniline-type
ring nitrogen in diols 8 and 9.

e The reaction was performed with a
1:5 molar ratio epoxide/H2SO4 to favor the formation
of diacetate 15 (see Experimental Section).

f The spectrum of the diastereomeric
mixture has been recorded in CD3OD because in DMSO-d6, the cis salt immediately isomerizes
into the trans one.

g The data reported in square brackets
refer to the trans indolizinium bromide 2.

h The data reported in square
brackets
refer to compound 11.

i The data reported in square brackets
