Lipid peroxidation (LPO) in cellular membranes can cause
severe
membrane damage and potential cell death. Although oxidized phospholipids
have been proved to lead to great changes in the structures and properties
of membranes, effects of low-level LPO on membrane permeability have
not yet been fully understood. Here, we explored the molecular mechanism
of low-level LPO changing the permeability of nitroaromatic molecules
across a lipid bilayer by all-atom molecular dynamics simulations.
The results reveal that the enhanced passive transport of nitroaromatic
molecules lies in the size of defects (i.e., water “finger”
and “cone”), which is further dependent on the extent
of LPO and the structural feature of solutes. In detail, if the solute
can form more hydrogen bonds with water, which stabilizes the water
into a large-size cone, there is a greater permeability coefficient
(P). Otherwise, a small-size finger only results
in a small increase of P. For example, the presence
of 15% oxidized lipids could result in an increase of 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene
(TNT’s) P by more than 2 orders of magnitude
(from 1.7 × 10–2 to 2.39 cm·s–1). The result suggests that the membrane permeability can be greatly
promoted in the physiologically relevant environment with low-level
LPO, and more importantly, clarifies the contributions of both the
hydrophobicity of the membrane interior and the structural feature
of solutes to such enhanced permeability. This work may provide significant
insight into the toxic effects of nitroaromatic molecules and the
pharmaceutical characteristics of tissues with oxidative damage.

Introduction
Lipid peroxidation (LPO), which results
from an oxidative attack
on the unsaturated acyl chains of lipids by free radicals,1,2 is involved in a number of diseases such as atherosclerosis,3,4 cancer,5 and neurodegenerative disorders.6 LPO can strongly modify membrane structures.
In detail, oxidized lipid chains can readily bend toward the membrane–water
interface,7,8 leading to the variation of membrane properties,
for example, an increase of the area per lipid, a decrease of the
membrane thickness, and a disorder of lipid tails.9−12 In addition, Siani
et al. found that the presence of hydroperoxized phospholipids could
facilitate the lateral diffusion of lipids and significantly reduced
the stretching modules of membranes.13 Boonnoy et al. observed a stable water pore in the 1-palmitoyl-2-linoleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylcholine (PLPC) bilayer with 50%
aldehyde product and further formation of micelle at higher concentrations
of oxidized lipids in the simulations up to 1 μs.9,14 These structural variations can further affect membrane functions,
such as resulting in an increase of permeability.7,13,15,16 Yusupov and
co-workers reported that the activation free energy of four reactive
oxygen species generally decreased in 50% oxidized lipid bilayers.17 The flip-flop rates of α-Tocopherols in
the oxidized bilayers are proved to be up to an order of magnitude
larger than that in the pure lipid bilayer.18 Recently, Su et al. also found that the translocation rate of small
nanoparticles was strongly enhanced upon LPO, without the formation
of water pores.19

In the physiological
or pathological environment, the extent of
LPO is relatively low due to the presence of numerous antioxidants
and saturated fatty acids that are not susceptible to peroxidation.
Davis et al.20 found that the ratio of
truncated oxidation products to the parent phosphatidylcholine was
only 0.1–2% during in vitro oxidation of purified human low-density
lipoprotein. Besides, the results of mass-spectrometric analysis also
showed that about 0.1–10% lipids were oxidized in several types
of cells triggered to apoptosis.21 Under
such conditions, the integrity of lipid bilayers can be well maintained
and the membrane will not undergo large deformation such as the formation
of pores or micelles.9,22 Accordingly, Wong-Ekkabut et
al.7 found that the water permeability
did not show a great change when the LPO ratio (i.e., the concentration
of oxidized lipids) of 11.1 mol % was introduced. However, Runas et
al.22 found that the LPO ratio of 2.5–10
mol % could result in increased passive permeability of fluorescent
molecules by 1 order of magnitude. In addition, Volinsky et al.23 also reported a notably enhanced flip-flop rate
(3–4 orders of magnitude) of lipid molecules in the presence
of 20 mol % oxidized lipids, without the formation of water pores.
Recent work focusing on plasma species has reported that the oxidation
of the lipid bilayer (without pore formation) did not strongly affect
the free-energy barriers of NO, NO2, N2O4, O3, and O4, whereas it reduced the
barriers of OH, HO2, and H2O2, and
therefore increasing their translocation probability across the membrane.24 These results suggested how the low-level LPO
(<20%) affects the passive diffusion of solute molecules across
a membrane still remain controversial and has yet been fully understood.
To the best of our knowledge, although the changes of membrane permeability
induced by LPO have been extensively studied, the cause of enhanced
permeation remains to be fully identified. A lot of literature studies
explained this enhancement with respect to the lipid membrane, for
example, increased disorder of lipids,17,25spontaneous
formation of water pores,14,26 and decreased hydrophobicity
of the membrane interior,19 whereas neglected
the contribution of the structural feature of solutes, which may result
in the different influence of LPO on the permeation, especially passive
permeation without the water pore of different solute molecules.

Passive diffusion, while not the only pathway for small molecules
to cross a membrane, is also a generic mechanism by which drugs and
environmental toxins can enter a cell.27,28 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene
(TNT) is one of the most widely used explosives in civil and military
fields. As a class C carcinogen rated by the Environmental Protection
Agency, TNT can cause cataracts, hemolytic crisis, urinary tract infection,
reproductive toxicity, and kidney and liver tumors.29 Moreover, a number of studies showed that oxidative stress
(or LPO) in the metabolic process of nitro groups was one of the main
factors of TNT to result in diseases.30,31 Therefore,
the full understanding of the interactions between TNT (as well as
its metabolites) and the lipid bilayers containing oxidized lipids
is crucial to clarify its toxic effects. In the present work, we focused
on the effect of low-level LPO on the passive diffusion of TNT and
its metabolized products, 2-amino-4,6-dinitrotoluene (2A) and 2,4-diamino-6-nitrotoluene
(24DA), across a membrane composed of 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC) lipids (Figure 1). In addition, this work has
universal significance. We revealed the essence of low-level LPO promoting
the permeation of small (amphiphilic) molecules across a membrane,
which may qualitatively explain the above-mentioned contradictory
results.

in this study.

Results and Discussion
Effects of Oxidized Lipids on Structural Properties
During our long-time unbiased molecular dynamics (MD) simulations
(300 ns), no water pore was observed for both oxidized and nonoxidized
membranes, which indicated that the integrity of lipid bilayers was
well preserved in the presence of 5–15 mol % oxidized phospholipids
(Figure S2). This result accorded with
previous observations, in which the POPC membrane was still stable
even after 20 mol % POxnoPC was introduced.23 Meanwhile, the membrane structures have undergone slight changes
(Table 1). For example,
the area per lipid (APL) increased from 63.0 (pure membrane) to 66.9
Å2 (the membrane with the oxidation ratio of 15%,
15% system), and the corresponding thickness of the bilayer decreased
by 7.6% from 3.94 to 3.64 nm. The order parameter of lipid tails had
a similar change trend (Table 1). We also noted that the average order parameters of the sn-2 chain of alOX were around −0.04 to −0.03,
in a very good agreement with previous simulations.7 All of the above results also indicated that our all-atom
force field parameters could well describe the reorientation of the
oxidized lipid chain in the membrane and are reliable.

The mass densities of POPC lipids (oxidized and nonoxidized),
water,
and aldehyde groups along the bilayer normal (z-direction) are displayed
in Figure 2. After
alOXs were introduced into the lipid bilayer, their hydrophilic aldehyde
groups would leave the hydrophobic region and reach the membrane–water
interface (Figure 2c), which would further lead to a decrease of membrane thickness
(Figure 2a). We also
found that the mass density of lipids in the central region slightly
increased, which could be attributed to the interlacing of lipids
in different leaflets. To observe the integrity of oxidized lipid
bilayers, we also calculated the mass density profiles of water molecules
(Figure 2b). The results
showed that the water molecules could permeate deeper into the bilayer,
which suggested the increased water permeability, but the mass density
of water in the hydrophobic core was still zero, indicating the well-preserved
integrity of the membrane and the passive transport of nitroaromatic
molecules at the corresponding LPO levels.

water molecules and lipid tails are not shown for clarity. P and N
atoms in lipid heads are shown in blue. The tails of the selected
oxidized lipids are colored in white. The aldehyde groups are represented
by red spheres.

Potential of Mean Force (PMF) Profiles
Although the
bilayer was intact, the structural variations would still affect the
membrane permeability. To quantitatively describe this affection,
we calculated the potential of mean force (PMF) profiles (Figure 3) of TNT and its
two metabolized products (2A and 24DA) across the oxidized bilayer.
For comparison, the PMF profiles of these molecules across the nonoxidized
POPC bilayer were also taken from our previous study.32 PMF profiles showed that these solutes (TNT, 2A, and 24DA)
could spontaneously enter into the membrane interior from the water
phase; however, there was an obvious barrier in the membrane center.
The results clearly demonstrated that the pure barrier (ΔGPB, equal to the free-energy difference from
the water phase to the position of the free-energy maximum) is markedly
decreased upon the low-level LPO, implying the weakened barrier function
of the membrane and the increased permeability of solute molecules.32 In detail, ΔGPB of TNT across the pure membrane is about 15.9 kJ·mol–1, and this value decreases to 5.3 kJ·mol–1 (by 10.6 kJ·mol–1) when alOXs of 15% were
introduced into the natural bilayer. It should be stressed that in
the system with a lower oxidation ratio (10 and 5%), the value of
ΔGPB for TNT also drops by 5.3 and
8 kJ·mol–1, respectively. The similar results
were also observed for 2A and 24DA; in these systems, the decrease
of 6–8 kJ·mol–1 was found. We noted
that in the case of 24DA, the most significant variation of ΔGPB occurred in the system with 10% alOXs (10%
oxidized membrane), which may be rationalized by the close contact
of 24DA with aldehyde groups in the oxidized lipid tails in this system
(Figure S3, see later analysis). The calculation
of free energy clearly showed that the permeability of nitroaromatic
exogenous compounds can be changed even if the degree of lipid peroxidation
is low.

for (a) TNT, (b) 2A, and (c) 24DA in the presence of different concentrations
of alOXs.

Permeability Coefficient
To quantitatively estimate
the permeability variation of TNT, 2A, and 24DA in the presence of
different concentrations of alOXs, the inhomogeneous solubility-diffusion
model was utilized to calculate the permeability coefficient (P). P describes the ratio between the flux through the membrane
(J), and the solute concentration difference (ΔC) across it,33P = J/ΔC, and represents the
permeation speed through the membrane. The results are presented in Figure 4. We found that the
permeability coefficients of these nitroaromatic compounds were generally
enhanced by around 1–2 orders of magnitude, suggesting the
notable promotion of their capability to transfer across the lipid
membrane and enter cells, even if only 5% POPC lipids were oxidized.
Interestingly, the variations of P (ΔP) between different solutes also showed a remarkable discrepancy.
For example, the value of P of TNT increased by more
than 2 orders of magnitude, from 1.7 × 10–2 cm·s–1 (pure POPC bilayer) to 2.39 cm·s–1 (15% oxidized system). The result of 24DA also showed
an increase of about 1–2 orders of magnitude, from 6.9 ×
10–2 cm·s–1 (pure POPC bilayer)
to 1.11 cm·s–1 (10% oxidized system). However,
the change of 2A was relatively small, with only an increase of less
than 1 order of magnitude (from 0.99 to 6.75 cm·s–1) even in the presence of 15% oxidized lipids. To the best of our
knowledge, the permeability coefficients of TNT or its metabolites
have not yet been reported, but some simulations and experimental
works have investigated the effects of low-level LPO on the permeability
of water molecules, lipids, and fluorescent molecules.7,22,23 Although Wong-Ekkabut et al.7 observed that the permeability of water molecules
increased by 1–2 orders of magnitude at high concentrations
of oxidized lipids (50 mol %), the results in the presence of lower
concentrations of oxidized lipids (11.1 mol %) did not show a great
change of water permeability (only 2–4 times larger), regardless
of the type of oxidized molecules (with truncated or nontruncated
chains). Moreover, experiments of giant unilamellar vesicles (GUV)
demonstrated that the presence of hydroperoxy-POPC (POPC–OOH)
did not show any apparent change in the water permeability during
the photo-oxidation process.34 However,
a remarkably promoted lipid penetration has been demonstrated by the
fluorescence and MD simulations, in which the free-energy difference
of a single lipid from the aqueous phase to the membrane center decreased
by about 5 kJ·mol–1, corresponding to an increased
permeability coefficient of 3–4 orders of magnitude.23 In addition, GUV experiments also showed that
the permeability coefficients of fluorescent molecules through the
POPC membrane would increase by about 1 order of magnitude in the
presence of 10 mol % of POxnoPC.22 These
theoretical and experimental results suggest that the effect of LPO
on the permeability of the membrane might be related to not only the
changes of membrane properties but also the feature of solutes. The
results presented in our present simulations also showed that the
variations of permeability of different solute molecules were different.

function of the concentration of oxidized lipids. The colored regions
indicate the change of the order of magnitude.

Water Defects in the Membrane Interior
Here, we did
not observe the significant changes in the structural parameters of
the membrane (e.g., thickness, APL), so it was deduced that structural
changes (e.g., looser packing) were unlikely to be the main cause
of the great enhancement of membrane permeability. Therefore, we further
explored the factors leading to the increased permeability, mainly
focusing on the water defects (i.e., the water molecules enter into
the hydrophobic tail region of the membrane, including the water pore,
water “finger”, water “cone”, and so on).
Water pores have been considered an important factor contributing
to the enhancement of permeability for lipids and water molecules.23,35 As shown in Figure 5, the radial distribution function (RDF) provided clear evidence
for the favorable interactions of water molecules with the aldehyde
groups in the oxidized lipid tails. Due to the high mobility of aldehyde
groups,9 water molecules could easily enter
into the membrane interior by following the aldehyde groups in the
oxidized lipid tails and formed defects.

Figure 5 Radial distributions
of water molecules around the aldehyde groups
in the oxidized lipid tails for the systems with different concentrations
of alOXs.

To further describe the permeation of water molecules
into the
membrane in the presence of oxidized lipids, we calculated the number
of water molecules residing in the low-density tail region (|z| < 0.5 nm) as a function of simulation time in different
systems (Figure 6),
based on the 300 ns unbiased simulations. The results showed that
the capability of water molecules entering into the hydrophobic core
of the membrane increased with increasing concentration of alOXs.
To give a quantitative insight, we defined a parameter, occupancy
ratio of water molecules (Rw), which was
given by 1  where t0 is the time in which the low-density tail region was occupied
by more than or equal to one water molecules, t refers
to the total simulation time (i.e., the last 100 ns of total simulation
time, the first 200 ns was treated as system equilibrium). Surprisingly,
the results (Figure 6) showed that even the concentration of oxidized lipids (alOXs) as
low as 5% could lead to a great increase of Rw by a factor of around 10 (from 0.42 to 4.9%), suggesting
the notably increased probability of the formation of defects in the
hydrophobic core of the membrane. It should be noted that the tail
region was the main barrier for the transmembrane process of TNT,
2A, and 24DA (see also Figure 3). These defects would decrease the hydrophobicity of the
tail region and further resulted in increased permeability. The result
could well explain the generally enhanced permeability of solutes,
even though only 5% of oxidized lipids were introduced and the structures
of the membranes were not significantly altered.

(|z| < 0.5 nm) as a function of simulation time
for the system with the various extent of LPO. (a) 0%, (b) 5%, (c)
10%, and (d) 15%. Rw refers to the occupancy
ratio of water molecules, and these systems do not contain solutes
(TNT, 2A, and 24DA).

Moreover, to search the origin of different permeability
variations
of TNT, 2A, and 24DA, the behaviors of these solutes at the bilayer
center (with free-energy maximum) were also explored. In the pure
POPC membrane without oxidized lipids, no stable water molecules were
found in the central region for all species due to the hydrophobicity
of the bilayer interior (data not shown). However, in the binary mixed
bilayers with alOXs, we observed that there were some water molecules
stably residing in the neighboring region of solutes at the bilayer
center (last for tens of nanoseconds). Moreover, these stable water
molecules were also distinct, which could be classified as a single
water molecule (Figure 7i), water finger (a string includes 2–4 water molecules which
connect the solute and membrane–water interface, Figure 7e), and water cone (a cone
consists of water molecules, which connected the solutes and membrane–water
interface, usually including more than 5 water molecules, Figure 7c).

TNT (a–c), 2A (d–f), and 24DA
(g–i) at the center of the membrane with 5–15 mol %
of alOXs. The N and P atoms in lipid heads are colored in yellow,
and the water molecules are represented by cyan lines or cyan spheres.

In the case of TNT in the membrane with 5% of alOXs
(TNT-5% system),
we did not observe the formation of any stable water molecules (Figure 7a). However, when
the concentration of alOXs increased to 10%, the single water molecule
was observed to be captured by the neighboring solutes (Figure 7b), and a stable water cone
was found in the TNT-15% system (Figure 7c). For compound 2A, the water finger was
found for all of the three systems in spite of various concentrations
of alOXs (Figures 7d–f). In addition, the results of 24DA also demonstrated the
formation of a water finger in the 24DA-10% system (Figure 7h) and the single water molecule
in the 15%-24DA system (Figure 7i). Furthermore, the results also indicated that the size
of stable defects (i.e., the number of water molecules contained in
the defects) might be relevant to the extent of permeability enhancement
of solutes. For example, in the TNT-15% system (i.e., the formation
of water cone), the P of TNT increased by 2 orders
of magnitude (Figure 4a), whereas only an increase of around 1 order of magnitude was obtained
for 2A and 24DA (Figure 4b,c), in these cases the water finger or a single water molecule
was observed. This result could be well rationalized by the further
decline of local hydrophobicity of the membrane interior induced by
the water cone with a larger size. One point worth emphasizing was
that in the 10% oxidized system, 24DA induced a larger stable defect
(i.e., a water finger) than the 5 or 15% systems. The snapshots showed
that 24DA closely contacted with an aldehyde group in the oxidized
lipid tails in the 10% oxidized system (see Figure S3). This close contact, which was not observed in 24DA-5 or
24DA-15% system, could promote the penetration of water molecules
into membranes and further result in a larger decrease of the free-energy
barrier, as presented in Figure 3c. The RDF analysis of solutes at the bilayer center
with water molecules quantitatively described the different capabilities
of solutes to stabilize the surrounding water molecules (see Figure S4).

In the biased simulations,
the constrained force on the solutes
may have a significant effect on the interactions between nitroaromatic
molecules and water defects. To confirm the above results, we used
the result of biased simulations, in which the solutes are constrained
at the center of the bilayer as the initial structures to perform
additional 120 ns unbiased MD simulations. We only consider the 15%
systems and conclude that other systems have similar results. As plotted
in Figure S5, the solutes (TNT, 2A, and
24DA) do not easily reach the center of the bilayer in 120 ns of unbiased
simulations due to the existence of the central barrier, and the closest
distance between the solutes and bilayer center ranges from 0.4 to
0.6 nm. Furthermore, the snapshots corresponding to the closest distance
suggest that TNT can also lead to the formation of water cone without
a constrained force, which is not observed for other molecules, in
excellent agreement with the results from biased simulations.

Thus, it was inferred that the effect of oxidized lipids on the
passive membrane permeation of nitroaromatic molecules had two aspects:
(1) the oxidized lipid chain reversal could increase the permeation
of water molecules into the hydrophobic core of membranes, which would
lead to the generally enhanced permeability of solutes; (2) after
the solutes were introduced into the hydrophobic region of membranes
(e.g., the bilayer center), the strong, attractive interactions between
solutes and water molecules could bring the neighboring transient
water molecules to be stable. The stable water molecules would further
reduce the local hydrophobicity of the membrane interior and were
conductive for solutes to overcome the corresponding free-energy barrier.
Recently, Razzokov et al.24 observed that
LPO did not strongly affect the passive permeability of NO, NO2, N2O4, O2, and O3, while significantly increased the permeation of more hydrophilic
OH, HO2, and H2O2, which, based on
our conclusions, can be well explained by the stronger hydrogen bonding
ability of the latter molecules. We deduced that the above results
were nonspecific and might also be applicable to other amphiphilic
molecules, at least the stable water molecules have been observed
in the passive transport of amphiphilic phospholipids through the
oxidized POPC membrane by Volinsky and co-workers.23

Orientation of Solutes at the Center of Membrane
The
above results showed that the different capabilities of solutes to
interact with water molecules in the hydrophobic core of the membrane
(or the capability to stabilize the neighboring water molecules) might
be the crucial factor to result in the discrepancy for the permeability
of different solutes. Then, we also explored the reason why the water
cone was only observed in the case of the 15%-TNT system. The distributions
of tilt angle β (β was defined as the angle between the
normal direction of the benzene ring plane of solute molecules and
the z-direction of the system) were calculated for
all of the solutes as displayed in Figure 8. It was suggested that the normal direction
of the benzene ring plane of TNT preferred to be perpendicular to
the z-direction at the center of the nonoxidized
membrane. Whereas in the system containing 15% alOXs, the normal direction
of the benzene ring plane of TNT readily became parallel to the z-direction, which ensured that all three nitro groups of
TNT could be in close contact with water molecules. We deduced that
the ability of TNT to reorient inside the membrane caused the larger
capability to stabilize the surrounding water molecules, and so resulted
in the formation of a water cone. This reorientation was not found
for the systems containing 2A or 24DA. Instead, the perpendicular
orientation was maintained in these cases, which could be attributed
to the different abilities of functional groups (−NO2 and −NH2) to bind water molecules.32 These observations were also supported by the
snapshots presented in Figure 7. It should be noted that the reorientation of solutes is
unlikely to be a necessary factor for the significant promotion of
passive permeability under low-level lipid peroxidation. Based on
our present result, we inferred that if the interaction between solutes
and water molecules (mainly H-bonds) is stronger enough to induce
the formation of water cone or even water pore, a remarkably enhanced
permeability is also expected.

Conclusions
In this work, we performed all-atom simulations
to investigate
the effect of low-level lipid peroxidation (LPO, 5–15 mol %)
on the passive permeability of three nitroaromatic molecules (TNT
and its two metabolites) through lipid bilayers and the corresponding
mechanisms at the molecular level. The polar moiety of oxidized lipids
(the aldehyde group in this work) at their terminals can strongly
modify membrane structures and their biological functions due to their
reversal. Consequences similar to previous studies included the increased
area per lipid, bilayer thinning, and decrease of lipid tail order
parameter. Additionally, we focused on the permeability changes of
nitroaromatic molecules and their nature.

PMF profiles reveal
the different-level decrease of the free-energy
barrier (5.3–10.6 kJ·mol–1) in the hydrophobic
core of bilayers for these nitroaromatic compounds (TNT, 2A, and 24DA),
which corresponds an increase of permeability coefficients (P) by
1–2 orders of magnitude. Meanwhile, the variation degree of
P shows a remarkable discrepancy for different solutes. For example,
the presence of 15 mol % oxidized lipids can lead to an improvement
of more than 2 orders of magnitude in the permeability of TNT, while
only an increase of less than 1 order of magnitude was observed for
2A permeability even at the same concentration of oxidized lipids.

The introduction of oxidized lipids is followed by the deeper penetration
of water molecules into the hydrophobic core of the membrane and the
formation of defects, and further leading to an increase of the permeability
of nitroaromatic molecules. More importantly, the role of structural
features in the enhanced permeability of solutes induced by LPO has
been qualitatively estimated, and we reveal that the degree of permeability
enhancement depends not only on the concentration of oxidized lipids
but also on the structural characteristics of solutes. Specifically,
at the same concentration of oxidized lipids, the increase in permeability
of solutes capable of forming a larger-size water cone or water pore
is greater than that of solutes which can only form a smaller-size
water finger or even a single water molecule, which is dependent on
the solute–water interactions (mainly H-bonds) inside the membrane.
These results are encouraging because most of the small neutral molecules
and drug molecules are passively transported through the membrane,
and for the drug molecules targeted for the diseases associated with
LPO, our results indicate that it is possible to improve the capability
of small molecular drugs to pass through the membrane under oxidative
stress by modifying their molecular structures.

Methods
System Preparation
In this work, 128 phospholipid molecules
of POPC (Figure 1)
were used to build the model of pure lipid bilayers by the CHARMM-GUI
bilayer builder,36 which was hydrated by
around 13 000 TIP3P water molecules. Lipid bilayers were oriented
perpendicular to the z-axis of the simulation box.
The final size of the box was about 6.4 × 6.4 × 12.7 nm3, and the periodic boundary conditions were applied in all
directions. The ionic concentration was set to 0.15 M NaCl.

To introduce the LPO, the binary mixture systems were constructed
by replacing various numbers of POPC lipids with one of its principal
oxidative products (alOX, with an aldehyde functional group, Figure 1) in the model of
lipid bilayers.26,37 The concentrations of alOX were
chosen as 5, 10, and 15 mol % to represent the low-level LPO. These
systems containing oxidized lipids were built using the Packmol package.38 The all-atom CHARMM36 force field39 was utilized to describe POPC molecules. The
parameters of nitroaromatic molecules were obtained from the CHARMM
General force field (CGenFF).40 The missing
force field parameters of alOX were obtained from quantum chemistry
calculations by the ffTK41 and Gaussian
0942 programs, and the detailed process
and parameters are provided in the Supporting Information.

MD Simulations
To remove the unreasonable contacts,
the steepest-descent algorithm was first utilized for energy minimization.
After 1 ns pre-equilibrium, 300 ns NPT simulations were performed
for all model membranes, and the last 100 ns was used to calculate
the properties of the membrane. All MD simulations were performed
using GROMACS software (version 5.1.2).43 The simulations were carried out with time steps of 2 fs in conjunction
with constraints applied to all bonds involving hydrogen by the LINCS
algorithm.44 The SETTLE algorithm45 was chosen to constrain the bond length and
angle of water. Electrostatic interactions were solved by the particle
mesh Ewald (PME) algorithm,46 and van der
Waals interactions were switched to zero smoothly between 1.0 and
1.2 nm. A velocity rescale thermostat47 was used to maintain the temperature at 300 K with a coupling constant
of 0.2 ps. Semi-isotropic pressure at 1 bar was controlled by the
Parrinello–Rahman barostat48 with
a coupling constant of 2 ps and compressibility of 4.5 × 10–5 bar–1. The trajectory was stored
at every 20 ps. The snapshots were produced by the VMD 1.9.2.49

Potential of Mean Force (PMF) and Permeability Coefficient
The calculation of free-energy (ΔG) profiles
(or potential of mean force, PMF) was performed using the umbrella
sampling method.50 Due to the symmetry
of lipid bilayers, we only calculated the free-energy differences
of solute molecules transferring from the aqueous phase (z = 4 nm) to the bilayer center (z = 0 nm). A total
of 32 windows were divided, with the space of 0.2 nm in the aqueous
phase (from 4 to 2.2 nm) and 0.1 nm inside the membrane (from 2.1
to 0 nm). The initial structures were obtained from steered molecular
dynamics (SMD).51 Each window was run for
50 ns in the NPT ensemble, and the first 30 ns was treated as equilibrium.

Considering that the membrane was an inhomogeneous environment,
the inhomogeneous solubility-diffusion model,52 which has been proved to capture the permeation of small molecules,28 was utilized to calculate the permeability coefficient
(P) of all of the compounds. In this model, the permeability
coefficient can be calculated by 2  where ΔG(z) and D(z) are the free energy
and diffusion coefficient at a given z-position from
the bilayer center, ΔG(z)
is obtained from umbrella sampling calculations, and D(z) can be calculated according to the force autocorrelation
method52 using the following equations 3   4  where R is the gas constant, T is the temperature (K), F(z,t) is the constrained force on the solute at
a given z-position along the z-direction.

Key Parameter Calculations
The parameters of the area
per lipid (APL) and the deuterium order parameter (SCD) of hydrocarbon tails were computed to explore the
effect of the LPO ratio on the structural properties of the membrane
as follows 5   6  Lx and Ly is the box length in the x- and y-direction, respectively, and Nlipid is the total number of lipids (including the alOX)
in the bilayer. θ is the angle between the C–D (C–H
in the present simulations) vector and the bilayer normal. The brackets
indicate the ensemble average. The thickness of the membrane is considered
as the distance of the center of the mass of phosphorus atoms in the
two leaflets.
