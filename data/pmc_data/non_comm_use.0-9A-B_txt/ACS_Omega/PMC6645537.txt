We report here an efficient and easily
reproducible two-step approach
to heterocycle-substituted amino-pyrazoles from heterocyclic acetonitriles
and their unprecedented subsequent transformations to fully substituted
pyrazoles. Such transformations include regioselective derivatization
from polyamino derivatives, formation of tetracyclic compounds in
up to 45% overall yield, and deaminative transformations through diazotization,
followed by arylation through Suzuki–Miyaura cross-coupling
and C–H activation, providing arylated pyrazoles in up to 71%
yield over four steps. This strategy allows the swift introduction
of significant molecular complexity to a range of scaffolds.

1 Introduction
Heterocyclic
chemistry has been a field of continuous research
for more than a century, and it remains an active domain of research
because heterocyclic compounds have shown potential in numerous applications
and various fields such as medicinal chemistry,1,2 photophysics,3−5 and material sciences.6 This continuous
activity is driven by the requirement of particular functionalization
that can require awkward synthetic processes. It is therefore still
important to develop approaches that achieve direct access to unprecedented
substitution patterns on heterocyclic compounds. This is especially
true for 5-amino-pyrazole, which is a scaffold commonly found as a
synthetic intermediate en route to numerous biologically active compounds
such as pyrazolopyrimidine.7−12

There are only a few strategies used to access the pyrazole
scaffold.13 A first one is the formal intramolecular
hydroamination
of an alkyne with a tethered hydrazine derivative (Scheme 1, path a).14−25 Another strategy, recently reported, is based on copper catalyzed
N–N bond formation of the pyrazole (Scheme 1, path b).25 A
third approach relies on the cycloaddition of a range of 1,3-dipoles
with an alkyne or alkene. Among the dipoles involved, diazo compounds
have found numerous applications, as have nitrilimines (generated
in situ from halogenated hydrazoyles) and sydnones after CO2 extrusion (Scheme 1, path c).26−28 Such an approach has also recently found a formal
intramolecular extension under Pd catalysis.29 Finally, the fourth and most documented one is the condensation
of 1,3-dielectrophilic synthons with hydrazine or its substituted
forms (Scheme 1, path
d).13,30 This approach encompasses not only these
1,3-dicarbonyl precursors but has also been exemplified by multicomponent
versions generating the 1,3-dicarbonyl precursors or their equivalent
in situ.

Scheme 1 General Routes to Pyrazoles
Yet, such 1,3-dicarbonyl precursors, especially those
featuring
aromatic heterocycles on position 2, require multiple step syntheses
of a precursor. Moreover, the involvement of substituted hydrazines
can introduce potential losses of regioselectivity that hamper the
overall efficiency of the synthetic process.

As this has very
recently been illustrated,31 targeting densely functionalized
pyrazoles still represents a challenge that is currently attracting
significant research efforts. Therefore, providing a short, efficient,
and selective route to 5-aminopyrazoles and their further deaminative
transformations presents an exciting innovation toward the generation
of diversely functionalized pyrazole derivatives. We report here the
simple generation of heterocyclic-substituted 1,3-dicarbonyl-compound
equivalents and their facile transformation into densely substituted
5-aminopyrazoles (and isoxazoles). Further transformation of the 5-amino
group for generation of fused polyheterocycles and the creation of
C–C bonds have been achieved by different palladium-catalyzed
approaches, as illustrated in Scheme 2.

Scheme 2 Straightforward and Selective Access to Densely Functionalized
Pyrazoles
2 Results
and Discussion
As stated above, the first issue related to
the Knorr pyrazole
synthesis is the generation of the 1,3-dielectrophile featuring the
desired substituents. We identified compounds 6–9 as readily accessible 1,3-dielectrophile equivalents that
could allow a highly selective generation of pyrazoles from substituted
hydrazines in an overall atom- and step-economical fashion. Such derivatives
can be accessed through the condensation of the anion of 2-azahetarylacetonitriles 1–4 (obtained via deprotonation by NaH)
and 5-methoxy-1-R-3,4-dihydro-2H-pyrrol-1-ium salt 5 in dimethylformamide (DMF) (Scheme 3).a

Scheme 3 Synthesis of 2-Hetaryl-2-(1-R-pyrrolidin-2-ylidene)acetonitriles 6–9
The reaction proceeded immediately at room temperature
(rt) leading
to the desired 2-hetaryl-2-(1-R-pyrrolidin-2-ylidene)-acetonitriles 6–9 in good yields (67–91%) after
precipitation from water and further filtration.

Single crystals
suitable for X-ray diffraction (XRD) study were
obtained by solvent diffusion. The structures in the solid state revealed,
as illustrated in Figure 1 for 7b, that the diastereoisomer featuring lower
steric strain (N-alkyl and CN in the cis position) is preferentially
formed, as expected.

Figure 1 Crystal structure 7b obtained by X-ray diffraction
with the atom numbering used in the crystallographic analysis. Thermal
ellipsoids are drawn at 50% probability level.

For all structures, the pyrrolidine rings are almost planar
(deviation
from plane below 0.16 Å) and are coplanar with the heterocyclic
substituent (dihedral angle under 9°), which is indicative of
the delocalization of the enamine moiety both toward the nitrile and
heterocycle. This promotes a general trend toward N4–C10 bond
shortening and C10–C8 bond elongation (as compared to standard
bond length values32). A clear correlation
between the C8–C9–N3 angle values and the electron-withdrawing
abilities of the heterocyclic substituent is observed, which implies
that both the nitrile and the heterocycle are involved in electron
delocalization (Table 1).

6	9a	1.339	1.401	177.5	1.9	0.019	
Interestingly, such
delocalization promotes a shift in the enamine–imminium
equilibrium, enhancing the electrophilicity of the C10 center and
simultaneously lowering that of the nitrile group. The deshielding
of C10 corroborates this trend as its chemical shift is found within
the 164.3–170.2 ppm range. Moreover, a partial isomerization
around the double bond can be observed in solution NMR.

These
combined findings suggested that these 1,3-dielectrophilic
compounds can be expected to react with hydrazine derivatives in a
very regioselective fashion.33−38

We therefore engaged these compounds toward the synthesis
of 3-(ω-aminoalkyl)-4-hetaryl-5-aminopyrazole
(or isoxazole) 10–16 by addition
of hydrazine (and its derivatives) or hydroxylamine (Scheme 4). The reaction proceeded smoothly
in refluxing dioxane with 10–20 equiv excess of the binucleophile
reagent and provided the pyrazoles and isoxazoles in moderate to good
yields (Scheme 4).
The use of unsymmetrical methylhydrazine provided the methylpyrazole
with complete regioselectivity. The nature of the alkyl substituent
on the pyrrolidine nitrogen was shown to only moderately affect the
efficiency of the reaction (10a–c). Moving from methylhydrazine to hydrazine hydrate was found to
promote a decrease in reaction yields (10c vs 11c), whereas no discernable effect was observed upon switching from
methylhydrazine to hydroxylamine (13b vs 14b). Finally, variations in the nature of the heterocyclic moiety did
not significantly affect the overall efficiency, although benzothiazole
substitution systematically provided better efficiencies, all things
being otherwise equivalent.

Scheme 4 Synthesis of 3-(ω-Aminoalkyl)-4-hetaryl-5-aminopyrazole
(Isoxazole) 10–16
3-(ω-Aminoalkyl)-4-hetaryl-5-aminopyrazole
(isoxazole) 10–16 were isolated with
satisfactory
analytical quality after solvent evaporation and purification by trituration
in acetone or acetonitrile, or by column chromatography.

The
involvement of the nitrile group, initially present in 6–9, in the reaction is highlighted by
the disappearance of its characteristic stretching vibration absorptions
in the 2198–2178 cm–1 range of the IR spectra.

Thorough structural analysis of the compounds was carried out using 1H NMR, 13C MNR, two-dimensional (2D) NMR techniques
(correlation spectroscopy (COSY), heteronuclear multiple-bond correlation
(HMBC), heteronuclear multiple-quantum correlation (HMQC)), and IR.
Particularly, in DMSO-d6, a characteristic
singlet of NH2 in the 1H NMR spectrum is observed
at 6.25–6.94 ppm. Interestingly, this signal is shifted up-field
for isoxazoles, probably as a consequence of oxygen electronegativity
(16a, 8.04 ppm; 14b, 8.20 ppm). In both
cases, addition of D2O promotes the disappearance of these
singlets, evidencing the exchangeable nature of the corresponding
protons. The 13C NMR spectra of 10–16 show three signals corresponding to the carbons of the
pyrazoles (isoxazoles). The first one, found at a chemical shift in
the 147.1–149.0 ppm range, was assigned to the C5 atom of the
pyrazole ring, and again, this signal was shifted up-field for isoxazoles
(at around 169.2–170.5 ppm). The signals within the range 90.3–100.8
and 148.6–161.3 ppm correspond to C4 connected with a heterocyclic
substituent and to C3 bonded with the ω-aminoalkyl chain, respectively.

Pleasingly, 4-hetarylaminopyrazoles 10a, 10c, and 15a formed crystals suitable for XRD study, allowing
careful analysis of their structure. The benzothiazolyl substituent
is almost coplanar with the pyrazole ring, with a dihedral angle of
6.48 and 1.16° for 10a and 10c, respectively.
The flattened orientation of the planar fragments is stabilized by
an intramolecular hydrogen bond between one of the protons of the
amino group and the nitrogen of the benzothiazole. For 15a (Figure 2) featuring
a quinazolinonyl substituent, distinct changes in conformation were
observed. Unexpectedly, the hydrogen located, initially, at N2 in 9a was found to be covalently bound with the secondary amino
group in the aliphatic chain of 15a (N6–H6B 0.93
Å). The lone pair on N2 exhibits stronger conjugation with its
adjacent carbonyl group, as shown by the shortened N2–C7 (1.340
Å) and elongated C7–O1 (1.273 Å) bond lengths, when
compared to that of 9a (N2–C7, 1.378 Å; C7–O1,
1.230 Å). N2 forms an intramolecular hydrogen bond with H6B (N2···H6B,
1.89 Å; N6–H6B···N2, 175.49°), whereas
O1 forms an intermolecular hydrogen bond with H6A (O1···H6A,
1.78 Å; N6–H6A,···O1 170.96°) of an
adjacent molecule. The positioning of the pyrazole and quinazolone
planes (dihedral angle of 19.65°) in 15a allows
the molecule to adopt an energetically favored conformation, placing
both N2–H6B and N1–H3A in close proximity (H3A···N1,
2.24 Å; N3–H3A···N1, 127.29°).

diffraction with the atom numbering used in the crystallographic analysis.

Considering the analytical and structural data
obtained for the
pyrrolidine precursors, as well as precedents from the literature,33,34,36 a ring conversion from pyrrolidine
to pyrazole (or isoxazole) is expected to proceed via nucleophilic
attack of the unsaturated carbon of the pyrrolidine yielding B; spiro intermediates C would then form upon
attack of the second atom of the binucleophile on the nitrile group
in a favored 5-exo-dig fashion. Finally, ring opening of the pyrrolidine
ring promotes the aromatization of the azole ring and provides the
nitrogen-substituted aliphatic chain. Such an addition of nucleophile-spiro
annulation-ring opening (ANSARO) mechanism is thought to be operative
in this transformation.

Having this straightforward access to
densely functionalized pyrazoles
in hand, we further explored their synthetic potential by assessing
the ability to selectively introduce structural variations on their
reactive centers, namely, the amino groups.

The first approach
was to illustrate the possibility of selectively
functionalizing the amino groups substituting the pyrazole core. For
that purpose, we confirmed that the secondary alkylamine is significantly
more nucleophilic than the primary aromatic one. Indeed, alkylation
of the secondary amino group could be achieved simply by stirring 10a with 1 equiv of the base and 2.2 equiv of alkylating reagent
at room temperature, leaving the primary amino group unaffected (Schemes 5and 6, path A). The reaction produced a
white precipitate, which structure was confirmed to be 17 by analysis of the filtrated solid by 1H, 13C, and 2D NMR as well as high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS).
Expectedly, the symmetry achieved through formation of the ammonium
salt significantly lowers the quadrupolar coupling constant of nitrogen,
allowing observation in the 13C NMR spectrum of the 14N–13C coupling for the methyl and the methylene
carbons of the ammonium. Extensive attempts to perform Hofmann elimination
from 17 failed to provide the corresponding alkene, leading
to ammonium recovery or degradation when reaction conditions were
forced.

Scheme 5 Proposed Mechanism for the Ring Conversion
Scheme 6 Regioselective Alkylation of Amino Groups from 10a
Consequently, the
substitution of the primary aromatic amino group
was found to require the protection of the secondary amine (Scheme 6, path B). This could
be achieved in 93% yield by simple treatment of 10a with
a slight excess of Boc2O in trifluoroethanol for 10 min
at room temperature followed by column chromatography. With this protection
in place, we could perform a reductive amination of the primary amino
group to access 18, which was isolated after column chromatography
in 47% yield (44% over three steps from 10a) in a stepwise
fashion (quantitative yield based on recovered starting material for
the reductive amination).

To further highlight the usefulness
of heterocycle introduction
on the pyrazole core, we then turned our attention to the formation
of fused tetracyclic compounds (Scheme 7). For that purpose, we focused on the benzimidazole-substituted
pyrazole 12a. Indeed, in this specific case, having the
pendant amino group on the pyrazole and proximate NH of the benzimidazole
allows condensation with electrophiles such as orthoesters. This approach
could deliver pyrazolopyrimidine scaffolds of interest for medicinal
chemistry purposes, as has been exemplified in the development of
inhibitors of glycogen synthase kinase 3, an enzyme involved in numerous
diseases such as type II diabetes, Alzheimer’s disease, cancer,
bipolar disorder, and inflammation.39

Scheme 7 Straightforward Access to Fused Tetracyclic Structures
Upon boiling a mixture of 12a and 1,1,1-triethoxyethane
in the presence of acetic anhydride, we could achieve the synthesis
of 3H-benzo[4,5]imidazo[1,2-c]pyrazolo[4,3-e]pyrimidine 19 (Scheme 7, path A); it is important to note that a
dehydrating agent is required to bring the reaction to completion.
This illustrates the previously unreported, weak stability of the
formed pyrimidine ring that only tends to hydrolyze back to the acylated
starting material both under strongly acidic and basic conditions.40 Yet, under neutral conditions, 19 could be isolated and thoroughly characterized. The 1H NMR spectrum of 19 in CDCl3 shows two sets
of peaks corresponding to two unequally populated rotamers. Moreover,
the symmetry of the benzimidazole moiety initially found in 12a is disrupted through this transformation, promoting the
split of the two aromatic signals of 12a into four signals
for 19, namely, two doublets at 7.94 and 8.04 ppm and
two doublets of doublets at 7.41 and 7.53 ppm.

A similar tetracyclic
aromatic compound was also accessed by simple
treatment of 12a with an excess of tert-butyl nitrite in DMF (Scheme 7, path B). Under these conditions, the diazonium intermediate
could indeed be trapped by the imidazole nitrogen to generate the
corresponding triazene 20, with concomitant protection
of the secondary amine as a nitrosoamine. 20 was isolated
in 85% yield after column chromatography and fully characterized.
It exhibits a unique tetracyclic structure that has never been previously
described, and as such, expands the chemical space of heterocyclic
chemistry.

Finally, following this diazotization strategy, we
investigated
the lability of the 5-amino group. At first, we explored the ability
of these heterocyclic-substituted aminopyrazoles to undergo Sandmeyer-type
reactions. After extensive investigation, we found that to avoid the
formation of numerous byproducts, the reaction had to be carried out
at 65 °C with excess tert-butyl nitrite (5 equiv)
and I2 (4.3 equiv) in acetonitrile,41 furnishing iodopyrazole 21 in 38% yield (Scheme 8). As stated above
for the formation of 20, the secondary amine was converted
to its nitrosamine derivative. We found that this could be avoided
by first adding TsOH to the reaction mixture; under these acidic conditions,
the secondary amine is protected as a weakly acidic ammonium salt
avoiding nitrosation. Thus, only the primary aromatic ammonium formed
under these conditions appears acidic enough to undergo nitrosation
and water elimination to form the transient diazonium salt, which
finally generates the iodopyrazole 22 in 30% yield. Interestingly,
under these acidic conditions, the reaction proceeds with the formation
of the reductive deamination byproduct (C–H bond formation).
The introduction of iodine is easily monitored by the 13C NMR spectrum of 22 characterized by considerable shielding
of C5 by the adjacent I atom (10a, 147.1 ppm; 22, 86.5 ppm). Further, Boc protection of the secondary amine could
be achieved in trifluoroethanol yielding 23 in 70% yield.
This two-step iodination–protection proved only moderately
efficient, highlighting the nitrosamine as a potentially useful alternate
protecting group.

Scheme 8 Sandmeyer Iodination of the aminopyrazole Core
With these iodinated pyrazoles
in hand, we explored potential C–C
bond formation by way of Suzuki–Miyaura cross-coupling with
a range of boronic acids (Scheme 9). A first attempt using 22 and 4-methoxyboronic
acid under conventional conditions (5% Pd(PPh3)4, dioxane-H2O, Cs2CO3) provided
the desired cross-coupling compound 24a in 71% yield.
Yet the presence of the secondary amine made chromatographic analysis
and purification tedious. We therefore turned to 23 as
the starting pyrazole and were pleased to achieve the cross-coupling
to 24b isolated in quantitative yield. We could
further exemplify this reactivity by isolating 25 and 26 quantitatively, and 27 in 72% yield. Yet,
moving to ortho-substituted 2-nitrophenylboronic acid and 2,6-bis(trifluoromethyl)phenylboronic
acid fully inhibited the coupling reactivity due to the steric bulk
around the reactive site of the iodopyrazole derivative. We could
also access the tris-heterocyclic compound 28 using N-Boc-indole 2-trifluoroborate, albeit with a moderate yield
and under harsher conditions (140 °C) that promoted the thermolysis
of the Boc group.

Scheme 9 Suzuki–Miyaura Cross Coupling of Iodinated
Pyrazoles
Considering the more
efficient access to 21 (ca. 40%
vs ca. 20% for 23), we envisaged the unprecedented use
of nitrosamine as a protecting group during the Suzuki–Miyaura
cross-coupling. This was found to be a successful approach because
the cross-coupling leading to 24c occurred in quantitative
fashion.

Finally, considering the observation of reduced product
(∼1:1
relative to iodinated product) during the Sandmeyer reaction, we investigated
the possibility of performing such a reduction more efficiently. On
the basis of former reports, we could achieve radical deamination
of benzothiazole substituted pyrazole 10a to 29 with tert-butyl nitrite in dimethylformamide (Scheme 10).42 Indeed, opposite to the reaction with benzimidazole 12a, no intramolecular trapping to the triazene can be achieved
from 10a. Therefore, the classical homolytic decomposition
during diazotization allowed hydrogen abstraction from the solvent
by the pyrazolyl radical to afford the desired reduced compound 29, which was isolated and fully characterized. Similarly
to the transformations described above, the reaction proceeds with
concomitant nitrosation of the secondary amine. The 1H
NMR spectrum of 29 shows two sets of peaks corresponding
to two unequally populated rotamers, and the characteristic singlet
of the newly introduced proton arises at 7.88 ppm. Deprotection of
the nitrosamine to the corresponding ammonium salt could be easily
achieved by bubbling HCl gas in a methanol solution of 29.43 This two-step procedure gave 3-(4-(benzo[d]thiazol-2-yl)-1-methyl-1H-pyrazol-3-yl)-N-methylpropan-1-aminium chloride 30 in 89%
overall yield. The 1H NMR spectrum of 30 recorded
in DMSO-d6 features a broad singlet for
the two protons of the ammonium at 8.94 ppm that disappeared upon
D2O addition. Although nitrosamines are considered as having
limited value as protective groups (mainly as they are considered
carcinogenic),44 we believe, through all
our observations, that in this specific case, their facile generation
and deprotection make them an attractive option, provided cautious
experimental procedures are followed. Moreover, nitrosamines are also
known to promote the umpolung reaction of secondary amines through
deprotonation, and as such, they represent an interesting functionalization.45

Scheme 10 Two-Step Approach to 3-(4-(Benzo[d]thiazol-2-yl)-1-methyl-1H-pyrazol-3-yl)-N-methylpropan-1-aminium
Chloride 30 Synthesis
Having this reduced adduct in hand, we explored the possibility
of further functionalization through the C–H activation reaction,
as previously reported on pyrazoles.46,47 We found that
heating 29 at 70 °C in the presence of Pd(OAc)2, 4-bromoanisole, and tetrabutylammonium acetate in dimethylacetamide
(DMA) for 24h provided straightforward access to 30c in
quantitative yield (Scheme 11).

Scheme 11 Functionalization of Pyrazole through C–H Activation
Once again, this illustrates
the excellent compatibility of nitrosamine
protection with palladium-catalyzed cross-coupling reactions. Moreover,
this reaction path provides a highly efficient approach to densely
substituted pyrazoles featuring both aryl and hetaryl substituents
at the 4 and 5 positions, as 24c is isolated in 71% overall
yield from benzothiazolylacetonitrile.

3 Conclusions
In summary, we have described a two-step procedure for the synthesis
of fully substituted 4-hetaryl-5-aminoazoles from readily available
starting materials in a modified Knorr-type reaction. The reaction
was found to be fully selective thanks to an evidenced marked difference
between the two centers of the 1,3-dielectrophile. These highly functionalized
azoles have been shown to represent entries to various polyheterocyclic
compounds, providing a straightforward route to a wide chemical space.
Indeed, further reactivity of the 4-hetaryl-5-aminopyrazoles obtained
was investigated, providing highly regioselective transformations
and giving access to both known and unknown derivatives with high
nitrogen contents. Moreover, transformation of the 5-amino substituent
allowed the straightforward introduction of aryl and hetaryl moieties
at this position providing a four-step route to densely functionalized
pyrazoles. This also illustrates the efficient nitrogen protection
as a nitrosamine during the Pd-catalyzed cross-coupling reaction.
We consider that this approach opens new routes to enlarge the chemical
space of pyrazole-containing pharmacophores as it introduces chemical
complexity in an unprecedented swift fashion from simple starting
materials.

4.5 General Procedure for 2-Hetaryl-N-R-pyrrolidin-2-ylideneacetonitrile Synthesis
(6–9)
A solution of hetarylacetonitrile
(4 mmol) in DMF (10 mL) was added dropwise to a strongly stirred suspension
of NaH (107 mg, 4 mmol) in DMF (5 mL), and the reaction mixture was
stirred for 10 min until complete evolution of gas had occurred. A
solution of 5-methoxy-1-R-3,4-dihydro-2H-pyrrol-1-ium salt (6 mmol) in DMF (3 mL) was subsequently added
to the reaction mixture, and stirring was pursued until complete conversion
of the starting material had occurred (TLC control). Water was then
added to the mixture, promoting precipitation. The suspension was
additionally stirred for 30 min, and the precipitate was then filtered
and washed with cyclohexane. Further precipitation was achieved by
concentration of the initial mother liquid (water, DMF) and trituration
of the residues at 0 °C with water, filtration, and subsequent
washing with cyclohexane. Purification was carried out by column chromatography
or recrystallization from the appropriate solvent. The products are
obtained as a mixture of Z and E stereoisomers.

Note: the aliquot
for TLC was taken from the crude reaction mixture followed by addition
of water and extraction with EtOAc.

A suspension of tert-butyl (3-(5-amino-4-(benzo[d]thiazol-2-yl)-1-methyl-1H-pyrazol-3-yl)propyl)(methyl)carbamate
(187 mg, 0.47 mmol), AcOH (0.05 mL, 0.94 mmol), benzaldehyde (0.06
mL, 0.56 mmol), and activated molecular sieves in toluene (5 mL) was
stirred in a sealed vessel overnight at 120 °C. At this point,
two spots were detected by TLC (CH2Cl2–acetone,
9:1) corresponding to the reactant (Rf = 0.27) and the desired imine (Rf =
0.67 (bright yellow spot)). The reaction was broken off at that point,
filtrated through a plug of celite, and the liquid was concentrated
under reduced pressure. The obtained solid was redissolved in dry
ethanol (5 mL) and 3 equiv of NaBH4 (53 mg, 1.4 mmol) was
subsequently added. The reaction was stirred for 30 min at rt (during
this time, the color of the reaction mixture changed from yellow to
white due to reduction of the imine to amine) under Ar. Dilution of
the reaction mixture with ethanol, filtration through a plug of Celite,
and concentration under reduced pressure gave a mixture of 10a and 18 at 100% yield. After compound separation by
automated flash chromatography (elution system: gradient of CH2Cl2–acetone, 19:1 to CH2Cl2–acetone, 9:1), secondary amine 18 was
obtained as a colorless oil (108 mg, 0.22 mmol, 47%).

Amide (20)
t-BuONO (0.12 mL, d = 0.867 g/mL, 1 mmol) was added dropwise to a strongly
stirred solution of 4-(1H-benzo[d]imidazol-2-yl)-1-methyl-3-(3-(methylamino)propyl)-1H-pyrazol-5-amine 12a (142 mg, 0.5 mmol) in DMF (5 mL,
65 °C), and the gas evolution was observed by bubble counter.
After 10 min of stirring, TLC control (CH2Cl2–acetone, 9:1) indicated the presence of two spots corresponding
to the starting material and new product. The pH of the reaction mixture
was slightly basic. Another portion of t-BuONO (0.24
mL, 2 mmol) was added dropwise, and the pH of the reaction mixture
turned to acidic (pH ∼ 3). After 10 min of stirring, another
TLC control was made to ensure the conversion of starting material
and formation of one main product. The reaction mixture was allowed
to cool to rt, and pH was brought to neutral–slightly basic
by addition of saturated aq. NaHCO3. This aqueous phase
was extracted with EtOAc (three times), and collected organic extracts
were washed with brine and dried over MgSO4. The solution
was concentrated under reduced pressure and the residue was purified
by automated flash chromatography (elution system: CH2Cl2–acetone, 19:1) to yield 137 mg (0.42 mmol, 85% yield)
of 20 as a bright yellow solid (mp 163–164 °C).

Note: (1) the aliquot for TLC was taken from the reaction mixture
followed by addition of saturated aq. NaHCO3 to make pH
neutral–slightly basic and extraction with EtOAc. (2) The solution
of t-BuONO is acidic when purchased from commercial
sources. Its acidity is enough to generate the nitrosonium ion and
bring the reaction to completion.

4.7.8 N-(3-(4-(Benzo[d]thiazol-2-yl)-1-methyl-1H-pyrazol-3-yl)propyl)-N-methylnitrous Amide (29)
t-BuONO (0.24 mL, d = 0.867 g/mL, 2 mmol)
was added dropwise to a strongly stirred solution of 4-(benzo[d]thiazol-2-yl)-1-methyl-3-(3-(methylamino)propyl)-1H-pyrazol-5-amine 10a (0.301 g, 1 mmol) in
DMF (5 mL, 65 °C), and the gas evolution was observed by bubble
counter. After 10 min of stirring, the TLC control (CH2Cl2–acetone, 9:1) indicated the presence of two
spots corresponding to the starting material and new product. The
pH of the reaction mixture was slightly basic. Another portion of t-BuONO (0.48 mL, 4 mmol) was added dropwise, and the pH
of the reaction mixture turned to acidic (pH ∼ 3). After 10
min of stirring, another TLC control was made to ensure the conversion
of starting material and formation of one main product. The reaction
mixture was allowed to cool to rt, and pH was brought to neutral–slightly
basic by addition of saturated aq. NaHCO3. This aqueous
phase was extracted with EtOAc (three times), and collected organic
extracts were washed with brine and dried over MgSO4. The
solution was concentrated under reduced pressure, and the residue
was purified by automated flash chromatography (system: gradient of
EtOAc–CHA, 7:3 to EtOAc, 100%) to yield 290 mg (0.92 mmol,
92% yield) of white solid (mp 72–73 °C).

Note: (1)
the aliquot for TLC was taken from the reaction mixture followed by
addition of saturated aq. NaHCO3 to bring pH to neutral–slightly
basic and extraction with EtOAc. (2) The solution of t-BuONO is acidic when purchased from commercial sources. Its acidity
is enough to generate the nitrosonium ion and bring the reaction to
completion.

Amide (24c)
N-(3-(4-(Benzo[d]thiazol-2-yl)-1-methyl-1H-pyrazol-3-yl)propyl)-N-methylnitrous amide 29 (95 mg, 0.3 mmol),
Pd(OAc)2 (3.4 mg, 0.015 mmol), and Bu4NOAc (181
mg, 0.6 mmol) were placed in a flame-dried two-necked flask fitted
with a water condenser and rubber septum. The system was evacuated
and back-filled with argon. This sequence was repeated three times.
DMA (3 mL) and 4-bromoanisole (0.06 mL, d = 1.494
g/mL, 0.45 mmol) were sequentially added under a stream of argon at
room temperature. The resulting mixture was stirred at 70 °C
for 24 h. After cooling to room temperature, the reaction mixture
was diluted with EtOAc, filtered through a plug of Celite, and eluted
with additional EtOAc. The filtrate was concentrated under reduced
pressure, and the residue was purified using automated flash chromatography
(system: gradient of CH2Cl2–acetone,

a To obtain pyrrol-1-ium salts 5, 1-R-pyrrolidin-2-ones were treated with dimethyl sulfate at
80 °C for 2 h as described in the experimental section. Oils
obtained were used without any additional treatment. Alternatively,
such pyrrolinium salts could be obtained as solids upon treatment
with a saturated solution of KPF6 in water.
