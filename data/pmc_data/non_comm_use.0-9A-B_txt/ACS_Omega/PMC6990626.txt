Transmembrane TNFα, a crucial
signaling cytokine, holds anticell
proliferative potential. Successful delivery of this intact transmembrane
protein to the target site is quite intriguing. Amidst numerous nanocarriers,
a novel class of new generation macrophage membrane-coated nanocarriers
is endowed with innate tumor homing abilities and inherent capacity
of escaping body’s defense machinery. In this perspective,
a novel therapeutic module has been fabricated by coating a nontoxic,
biodegradable chitosan nanoparticle core with engineered macrophage
membrane-tethered TNFα. Herein, the expression of membrane-bound
TNFα was induced by challenging phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-differentiated
THP-1 cells with bacterial lipopolysaccharide. Subsequently, the as-synthesized
chitosan nanoparticle core was coated with a TNFα-expressed
macrophage membrane through an extrusion process. While transmission
electron microscopy imaging, sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide
gel electrophoresis, and western blotting results demonstrated successful
coating of the chitosan nanoparticles with the TNFα-induced
membrane, the cell viability assays on several cancer cells such as—HeLa,
MDA-MB-231, and MCF-7 revealed significant innate anticell proliferative
potential of these membrane-coated nanoparticles. Additionally, evaluation
of expression of several interleukins after treatment demonstrated
excellent biocompatibility of the membrane-coated nanoparticles. The
fabricated nanoparticles also demonstrated a dose-dependent cell death
in tumor spheroids, which was further corroborated with calcein AM/propidium
iodide dual staining results. Translation of the therapeutic efficacy
of the synthesized nanoparticles from monolayers to tumor spheroids
augments its potential in cancer therapy.

==== Body
Introduction
The complex network
of signaling cascades play a major role in
orchestrating the delicate harmony between cell growth, division,
and programmed death of cells.1 Proteins,
either in secreted or in membrane-bound forms, interact with their
respective receptors, which modulates intricate signaling networks
to maintain balance in the overall behavior of the cells. Highly regulated
signaling pathways by the proteins replace dead cells with new healthy
cells.2

In case of cell death-related
pathways, death signals like TNF,
CD95L, and TRAIL are important. Binding of these proteins on their
corresponding receptors initiates the death-signaling cascade, which
results in cell apoptosis.3 Recently, the
role of the transmembrane proteins in apoptosis has been widely studied.
Among the signaling molecules, transmembrane tumor necrosis factor
alpha has gained much interest in recent years because of its characteristic
cell killing ability after binding to its receptor.4 However, such recombinant proteins are unstable with short
half-life and are susceptible to disintegration.5 Therefore, in order to unleash the true potential of the
biological macromolecule, there should be a judicious combination
of the therapeutic moiety and a proper delivery vehicle.6 This imperative need has motivated researchers
to develop nano-based delivery systems.7

A diverse array of nanoparticles ranging from metallic, semimetallic
to polymeric particles has emerged.8 Amongst
these, biodegradable polymeric nanoparticles are the most promising
class for delivering biological molecules and drugs. These polymeric
nanoparticles are armed with multitude of advantages such as, enhanced
stability, higher drug payload, tunable physicochemical properties,
homogeneous particle distribution, and controlled drug release.9 Chitosan, consisting of α-(1–4)-2-amino-2-deoxy-β-d-glucan repeats, is one such FDA-approved biopolymer, which
has been reported as a drug-delivery vehicle in several biological
applications.10−12 However, use of bare nanoparticles often leads to
rapid clearance from blood stream because of opsonization.13 Coating nanoparticles with layers of hydrophilic
poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) has been established to deceive the body
immune system.14 Yet, rapid clearance of
the PEGylated nanoparticles has been reported when the animals were
injected with the second dose of nanoparticles, owing to the formation
of anti-PEG immunoglobulin M antibodies.15 Hence, a new generation of novel biomimetics could be an alternative
to cloak the synthetic nanocarriers by coating with natural membranes.16−19 A wide array of natural membranes have been reported to coat nanoparticles.
The natural membrane-coated nanoparticles could escape body’s
defense machinery and retain prolonged circulation time in the body.20 In this context, a variety of specialized cells
such as, macrophages, dendritic cells, and T-helper cells are known
to secrete cytokines. Among them, macrophages could easily produce
TNFα upon induction with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Furthermore,
macrophage membranes deserve special mention because macrophages are
the circulating sentinels of the body having innate characteristics
of homing toward the inflammation-affected area.21,22 Interestingly, the homing property of the whole macrophage cells
has shown accumulation of the drug-carrying macrophage cells near
cancer cells. However, the complete process of nanoparticle coating
with the inert membrane is cumbersome and the therapeutic response
would be exclusively dependent on the drug molecules loaded on the
nanocarrier. Therefore, we have ventured to infuse the therapeutic
potential in the membrane coating itself.

In the current study,
we have prepared innate therapeutic module
using engineered macrophages. Reports suggest that the macrophages,
when challenged with endotoxins like LPS, start secreting several
cytokines such as TNFα and interleukins within a short span
of 4 to 5 h.23 In view of the above rationale,
we speculated that the membrane-bound form of TNFα could be
obtained by modulation of the LPS induction time.24,25 Time-bound induction of TNFα expressed in the macrophage membrane
showed antiproliferative action against several types of cancer cells—HeLa,
MCF7, and MDA-MB-231 cells. Following this, the membrane vesicles
were prepared from the LPS-induced macrophage cells by extrusion methods.
To ensure a stable framework for these therapeutic vesicles, nontoxic
biodegradable polymeric FDA-approved chitosan nanoparticles were synthesized
and coated with the transmembrane TNFα-expressed macrophage
membrane. The fabricated membrane-coated nanoparticles were characterized
for biocompatibility, hemocompatibility, and stability. Maintenance
of functional integrity of the engineered macrophage membrane after
coating over the chitosan nanoparticle core was validated by cytotoxicity
studies on several cancer cell lines. The cell viability studies demonstrated
a dose-dependent decrease in cell viability. Furthermore, assessment
of the mode of cell death revealed that the cells were undergoing
apoptosis, a regulated and programmed manner of cell death. The therapeutic
efficiency of the designed therapeutic nanoparticles was further validated
on tumor spheroids, which mimic the complexity and heterogeneity of
in vivo conditions.26 Succinctly, in the
present study, fabrication and therapeutic application of a novel
biocompatible transmembrane TNFα membrane-coated nanocarrier
has been illustrated.

Results and Discussion
The preparation
of transmembrane TNFα-expressed macrophage
membrane coated-chitosan nanoparticles is a three-step procedure as
discussed in the Materials section. Initially,
THP-1 monocytes were differentiated into macrophages using varying
concentrations of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA). Schematic
representation in Figure 1A illustrated differentiation of monocytes to macrophages
in presence of PMA. Microscopic visualization demonstrated (Figure 1B) that the monocytes
became larger, granular, and less refractive, in a concentration-dependent
manner accompanied with a gradual conversion of floating monocytes
into adherent macrophages with increasing concentrations of PMA (0–100
μM). In addition, flow cytometry-based studies also depicted
an increase in the granularity of the cells with higher concentration
of PMA, essentially indicating successful conversion of monocytes
into granular macrophages (Figure 1C).

of monocytes differentiating into macrophages with increasing concentrations
of PMA, (i) 0, (ii) 40, (iii) 80, and (iv) 100 μM, respectively.

Synthesis of soluble TNF by the macrophages is
known to be driven
by the interaction of LPS with TLR on the macrophage surface as early
as 4 h post stimulation.25 Therefore, in
order to obtain membrane-expressed TNFα, the time duration of
LPS stimulation was initially optimized (data not shown). It was found
that 2.5 h of LPS stimulation was most suitable for maximum transmembrane
TNFα expression. Amount of LPS required for maximum induction
of transmembrane TNFα was also optimized by using varying concentrations
of LPS (upto 500 ng/mL). While Figure 2A illustrates the induction of TNFα on the macrophage
membrane, western blot analysis (Figure 2B) with anti-TNFα antibody on the isolated
membrane showed a gradual rise in the transmembrane TNFα concentration
up to 100 ng/mL, followed by a steady level of expression up to 500
ng/mL (Figure S1). Therefore, in order
to induce expression of transmembrane TNFα in THP-1 monocytes,
the above stated concentrations of PMA and LPS were used for all the
subsequent experiments. The expression on TNFα by the differentiated
macrophages upon LPS stimulation was also confirmed by semiquantitative
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using TNFα specific primers.
The gel image (Figure 2C) revealed a distinct band corresponding to transmembrane TNFα
around 750 bp in 100 ng/mL LPS-treated macrophages, while there was
no amplification in the untreated ones. The LPS-induced macrophage
membranes were isolated by hypotonic lysis buffer (details in Materials) and the homogenized suspension was centrifuged
to remove cell debris. Subsequently, the supernatant was centrifuged
to obtain the plasma membrane fractions of the macrophages.

PCR using TNFα-specific primers—lane 1: untreated, lane

samples.

After successful isolation of
the TNFα expressed-macrophage
membrane fraction, we embarked on the study of its therapeutic potential.
HeLa, MCF7, and MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with varying concentrations
(protein) of the membrane fractions for 48 h following which cell
viability was assessed using MTT assay by recording the absorbance
at 590 nm and keeping 630 nm as the reference. Cell viability percentage
was calculated and the results (Figure S2A) demonstrated a dose-dependent
decrease in proliferation of the cells treated with membrane fractions
expressing transmembrane TNFα, whereas no substantial decrease
in cell viability was observed for the uninduced membrane-treated
control group (Figure S2B). Thus, the inherent
anticell proliferative potential of the transmembrane TNFα-expressed
membrane fraction was validated, which paved the way for the subsequent
experiments.

Capitalizing on the antiproliferative potential
of the macrophage
membrane, we proceeded to fabricate this engineered membrane into
stable nanocarrier having inherent therapeutic potential. In this
regard, it was imperative to design a steady framework for the therapeutic
membrane. Therefore, the polymeric chitosan nanoparticle core was
synthesized using a well-established ionic gelation method. The as-prepared
chitosan nanoparticles were negatively charged (−0.7 mV) as
determined by zeta potential analysis (Figure S3) and the hydrodynamic diameter of the nanoparticles was
recorded as 237.5 nm (Figure 3C). Characterization by field-emission scanning electron microscopy
(FESEM) (Figure 3A)
and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (Figure 3B) established the successful synthesis of
uniform spherical chitosan nanoparticles having roughly 200 nm diameter.
Once the chitosan nanoparticles were synthesized, the subsequent step
was to evaluate cytotoxicity of the bare nanoparticles on cancer cell
lines. Results of MTT assay revealed no apparent cytotoxicity of chitosan
nanoparticle alone (Figure S4).

Figure 3 (A) FESEM image
of the synthesized chitosan nanoparticles, (B)
TEM analysis of the nanoparticles, and (C) hydrodynamic diameter of
the chitosan nanoparticles as evident from DLS measurement.

Following successful synthesis of the core, TNFα-expressed
macrophage membrane-coated chitosan nanoparticles were developed by
the process of serial extrusion of the membranes through 0.8 and 0.4
μm pore-sized membrane followed by combined extrusion of both
the membrane and the nanoparticles with 0.2 μm pore-sized membrane
as illustrated in Figure 4A. Successful membrane coating over the chitosan nanoparticles
was validated by TEM imaging, sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide
gel electrophoresis (SDS PAGE) and western blotting with anti-TNFα
antibody. TEM image (Figure 4B) showed distinct halos around the inner chitosan nanoparticle
cores denoting successful membrane coating around the chitosan nanoparticles.
Furthermore, SDS PAGE was also performed (Figure 4C), which revealed similar protein profiles
of the induced macrophage membrane and the membrane-coated nanoparticles
confirming membrane coating over the chitosan nanoparticles. Henceforth,
transmembrane TNFα-expressed membrane-coated nanoparticles are
termed as “nanoassembly” for our subsequent studies.
To confirm the presence of TNFα in the nanoassembly, western
blotting on nanoassembly was performed with the anti-TNFα antibody.
The results in Figure 4D revealed a distinct band (lane 3) corresponding to TNFα in
the nanoassembly. The dynamic light scattering (DLS) data in Figure 4E also depicted an
increase in size of the nanoassembly as compared to the bare chitosan
nanoparticles because of the membrane coating around the nanoparticles.

Before evaluating therapeutic potential of the system on cancer
cells, it was crucial to ensure the safety of the designed nanoassembly
for further biological application. Therefore, the biocompatibility
of the THP-1 membrane was examined. For this, the expression of several
interleukins that play a role in inflammation and in generation of
immunogenic response were assessed after treatment.27 Because macrophages are the key mediators of immunity,
human monocytes (THP-1 cells) were differentiated into macrophages
and the cells were treated with the nanoassembly. Subsequently, the
expression of several interleukins, IL6 and IL1β were studied
with quantitative PCR keeping LPS-treated macrophages as a positive
control. The fold changes in expression of the genes were calculated
and as evident from Figure 5A, the membrane-coated nanoparticles did not elicit any immune
response because the expression of IL6 and IL1β was quite low
in comparison to LPS (0.5 μg/mL)-treated positive control samples.
Simultaneously, the hemocompatibility of the designed nanoassembly
was also evaluated by incubating them with intact human RBCs for 3
h on ice.27 Samples treated with 1% Triton-X
100 were considered to have undergone 100% hemolysis, while phosphate
buffer saline (PBS)-treated RBCs were kept as the negative control.
From Figure 5B, it
was evident that the designed nanoassembly did not induce any hemolysis,
whereas a visible hemolysis in the Triton X 100-treated positive control
was seen. In order to accomplish appropriate biomedical potential,
stability is crucial for any nanocarrier. Hence, the stability of
the nanoassembly was assessed over a period of 7 days by recording
DLS measurements. Interestingly, there was (Figure 5C) negligible difference in size of the nanoassembly
over a period of 7 days, which offers an additional advantage to the
designed therapeutic module.

by DLS for consecutive 7 days.

Upon completion of evaluation of safety and stability of the nanoassembly,
the subsequent step was to determine its functional integrity. Hence,
MTT cell survival assay was performed on several cell lines, viz—HeLa,
MCF7, and MDA-MB-231 to determine the therapeutic potential of nanoassembly.
For this, the cells were incubated with increasing concentrations
of the nanoassembly and MTT assay was performed after 48 h. Results
of MTT assay (Figure 6) depicted a dose-dependent decrease in cell viability with increase
in concentration of the nanoassembly, which implied that the TNF-expressing
membrane retained its functionality even after serial extrusion. It
should be mentioned here that there was negligible cell death in the
samples treated with chitosan nanoparticles alone (Figure S4) essentially indicating the superior biocompatibility
of chitosan and thereby re-establishing the innate therapeutic potential
of TNFα-expressed membrane coating over the chitosan nanoparticle
core. From Figure 6 it is observed that the amount of nanoassembly required to bring
about IC50 in the HeLa cells (IC50: 1.317 μg/mL)
was much lower than that in MDA-MB-231 (IC50: 7.525 μg/mL)
and MCF7 (IC50: 5.9 μg/mL) cells. This can be attributed
to the differential expression of TNFα receptors on the surface
of these cell lines. The anticell proliferative effect of transmembrane
TNFα was reduced when the nanoassembly was preincubated for
1 h in presence of the anti-TNFα antibody (Figure S5). This confirmed the specific role of the transmembrane
TNFα component of the nanoassembly in growth inhibition, and
the other proteins present in the membrane after PMA induction did
not show any additive effect in the present study. Retention of the
activity was assessed by measuring the anticell proliferative potential
of the nanoassembly on HeLa cells following 7 days storage. MTT-based
cytotoxicity assay was performed, which demonstrated a dose-dependent
decrease in cell viability (Figure S6),
essentially indicating that the nanoassembly retained activity even
after storage for 7 days. Although, it should be mentioned here that
there was around twofold reduction in efficiency after storage as
compared to the freshly prepared nanoassembly.

upon treatment with increasing concentrations
of nanoassembly.

Cell death occurs by
two mechanisms—either apoptosis or
necrosis. While necrosis is a sudden unprogrammed event, apoptosis
is fundamentally a plan of programmed cell death involving a series
of regulated events.28 Therefore, to investigate
the mode of cell death induced by the designed nanoassembly, dual
staining of treated HeLa cells with calcein AM and propidium iodide
(PI) was performed. Calcein AM is a vital dye, which is converted
to a membrane impermeable fluorescent analogue by the cellular esterases.
Hence, calcein AM only stains live cells and the fluorescence leaks
out in case of completely membrane compromised cells.29 Whereas, PI is a DNA intercalating agent, which is selectively
permeable to the membrane compromised cells. Exploiting the differential
behavior of the two dyes, both treated and untreated HeLa cells were
stained for 30 min and visualized under a confocal microscope. Confocal
microscopy images (Figure 7) illustrated the presence of bright green or yellowish bodies,
which essentially denoted the cells that were undergoing early apoptosis;
whereas, cells with red nuclei were indicative of late apoptotic cells.

Figure 7 Assessment
of the mode of cell death using calcein AM and PI dual
staining of HeLa cells. (A) Untreated and (B) treated with nanoassembly.
E.A. and L.A. indicate early apoptotic and late apoptotic cells, respectively.

During apoptosis, the initiator caspase cleaves
and activates downstream
executioner caspases, which in turn cleaves subsequent proteins.30 Therefore, activation of executioner caspases
is considered as a signature of apoptotic cells. Therefore, the expression
of executioner caspases—caspase 3 and 7 were studied using
an executioner caspase detection kit. The cells were treated with
the nanoassembly for 12 h and incubated with the florigenic substrate
for 30 min followed by visualization under a confocal microscope.
The confocal microscopic images (Figure 8) displayed appearance of intense bright
green fluorescence in treated cells indicative of the activation of
the executioner caspases.

caspases. (i) Untreated cells and (ii) treated cells illustrating
activation of executioner caspases (green) denoted with arrows.

To further validate the effect of therapeutic efficacy
of the engineered
system, tumor spheroids of HeLa cells were generated by a facile forced
floatation method, as discussed in the Materials section.31 The spheroid growth was monitored
after every 24 h and 3 day old compact spheroids were used for experimental
purposes. For quantitative evaluation of the therapeutic effect of
the fabricated nanoassembly on the spheroids, 3 day old spheroids
were treated with increasing concentrations of the nanoassembly for
48 h. The results (Figure 9) demonstrated a dose-dependent decrease in cell viability
of the spheroids with increase in concentration of the nanoassembly.
However, it should be mentioned that the amount of the nanoassembly
required for the attainment of IC50 in HeLa spheroids was
higher than IC50 of the corresponding monolayer culture.

For visual evaluation of live and dead cells, the spheroids
treated
with IC50 (7.1 μg/mL) and IC75 (10 μg/mL)
concentrations of the nanoassembly were further subjected to calcein
AM/PI dual staining procedure. The dual stained spheroids imaged using
a confocal microscope (Zeiss LSM 880), illustrated an increase in
dead (PI stained) cells after treatment as compared to the untreated
spheroids (Figure 10). Dual staining results on treated spheroids corroborated the findings
of the cell viability assay by alamar blue, as evident in Figure 9.

Conclusions
The present work amalgamates therapeutically relevant transmembrane-TNFα
expressed-macrophage membranes with nontoxic chitosan nanoparticles
to formulate a nanoassembly. Without interference of other cytokines,
increased cell death signal TNFα imparted therapeutic efficiency
to the otherwise noncytotoxic macrophage membrane upon LPS induction.
Excellent stability, hemocompatibility, and biocompatibility of the
fabricated nanoassembly paved the way to explore its functional integrity.
The membrane-coated nanoparticles retained dose-dependent anticell
proliferative properties when examined on three different cancer cells.
Evaluation of the mode of cell death unveiled triggering of apoptosis
in the cells after treatment with the nanoassembly. Successful regressive
effect of the nanoassembly on spheroids boosts the biological significance
of our study in the prospective new regime in cancer therapy, as the
spheroids closely mimic the in vivo tumor microenvironment. The translation
of cell retardation activity confirms the immense potential of this
novel therapeutic nanoassembly as a “nanodrug”.

Materials
Cell Culture
MCF7 (breast cancer), HeLa (human cervical
cancer), MDA-MB-231 (triple negative breast cancer), and THP-1 (human
monocytes) cells were obtained from National Center for Cell Science,
Pune, India. MCF7, HeLa, and MDA-MB-231 cell lines were maintained
in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) supplemented
with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin–streptomycin.
THP-1 cell lines were maintained in RPMI media containing 10% heat-inactivated
FBS supplemented with 1% antibiotic solution. All the cells were maintained
in a humidified condition at 37 °C, with 5% CO2.

Monocyte Differentiation
THP-1 cells (monocytes) were
differentiated into macrophages by treating them with 100 nM PMA for
24 h. The PMA concentration used for differentiation was optimized
and differentiation into macrophages was confirmed by microscopy and
flow cytometry.

Optimization of LPS Concentration
The macrophages were
challenged with bacterial LPS to produce TNFα. The literature
suggests that the time of secretion of soluble TNFα by the macrophages
is 4–5 h. Our aim was to obtain transmembrane TNFα, so
we reduced the time to 2.5 to 3 h and optimized the LPS concentration
for induction of TNFα.

Isolation of the TNFα-Expressed Macrophage
Membrane
The macrophages were harvested by scraping and were
kept overnight
in a hypotonic lysis buffer containing sodium bicarbonate, ethylenediaminetetraacetic
acid, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. After overnight incubation, the
cell suspension was loaded into hand held Dounce Homogeniser and disrupted
with 30 passes each pestle. The suspension was centrifuged at 3500g to remove the larger debris, the supernatant was again
centrifuged at 15 000g for 40 min, and the
pellet was obtained containing the plasma membrane of the macrophages.
The pellet was washed 4–5 times with PBS by repeated centrifugation
to remove any other contaminants. To evaluate the expression of TNFα
in the isolated membrane of the macrophages, western blotting with
the anti-TNFα antibody was performed. The expression on TNFα
after adding 100 ng/mL LPS was also confirmed by semiquantitative
PCR using TNFα-specific primers. β-Actin was used as an
internal positive control.

Preliminary Cell Viability Assay with the
Membrane Fractions
In order to study the therapeutic potential
of the TNFα-expressing
macrophage membrane, HeLa, MCF7, and MDA-MB-231 were seeded in 96-well
plates and treated with increasing concentration of the LPS-induced
macrophage membrane. After 48 h, cell viability was evaluated using
MTT assay by recording the absorbance at 590 and 630 nm as background.

Synthesis of Chitosan Nanoparticles
Chitosan nanoparticles
were synthesized using the well-established protocol of ionic gelation
method using 0.5 mg/mL chitosan and 0.75 mg/mL TPP. The solution was
stirred for 24 h at 600 rpm. After synthesis, the solution was centrifuged
at 15 000 rpm for 30 min to pellet down the nanoparticles and
washed 4–5 times with water by repeated centrifugation to remove
any unreacted components. Zeta potential and hydrodynamic diameter
were measured by a PerkinElmer Lambda 25 spectrophotometer.

Imaging
of the Chitosan Nanoparticles
The chitosan
nanoparticles were characterized by FESEM and TEM. For FESEM, the
nanoparticles were drop-cast on an aluminum-coated piece of glass
coverslip and allowed to dry overnight followed by imaging. For TEM
imaging, 10 μL nanoparticle suspension was drop-cast on a carbon-coated
copper grid, air-dried, and observed using TEM (JEOL, MA).

Macrophage
Membrane Coating around the Chitosan Nanoparticles
Macrophage
membranes were serially extruded through 0.8 and 0.4
μm pore-sized membranes in the extruder (Avanti Polar Lipids).
To prepare macrophage membrane-coated chitosan nanoparticles (nanoassembly),
chitosan nanoparticles and macrophage membrane vesicles were combined
and extruded through a 0.2 μm pore-sized membrane.

Confirmation
of Membrane Coating
Membrane coating over
the chitosan nanoparticle core was confirmed by TEM imaging, SDS PAGE,
and western blotting with the anti-TNFα antibody. For TEM analysis,
10 μL of the as-synthesized nanoparticles were drop-cast on
a carbon-coated copper grid, air dried overnight, and observed under
TEM (JEOL, MA). In order to ensure successful coating of the macrophage
membranes over the chitosan nanoparticle, SDS PAGE was carried out.
Proteins from uninduced macrophages, LPS-induced cell membranes, and
induced macrophage membrane-coated nanoparticles were electrophoresed
in 12% SDS PAGE. Silver staining was performed to visualize and compare
the proteins in the gel. Furthermore, western blotting was also performed
to validate successful membrane coating over the chitosan nanoparticles.
For this, equal amount of proteins from uninduced macrophages, LPS-induced
cell membranes, and induced macrophage membrane-coated nanoparticles
were electrophoresed in 12% SDS PAGE for separation according to molecular
weight. Subsequently, the proteins were transferred from the gel to
the poly(vinylidene difluoride) membrane followed by blocking for
2 h with 4% bovine serum albumin. The protein-containing membrane
was then incubated with the anti-TNFα primary antibody overnight
followed by incubation with the horseradish peroxidase-tagged secondary
antibody. The blots were developed using a chemiluminescent peroxidase
substrate (Sigma) and visualized under a ChemiDoc transilluminator
(Bio-Rad). The hydrodynamic diameter of the membrane-coated nanoparticles
was recorded by a PerkinElmer Lambda 25 spectrophotometer.

Biocompatibility
Study
Biocompatibility of the THP-1
membrane-coated nanoparticle was studied before evaluating therapeutic
potential of the system on cancer cells. For this, the expression
of several interleukins was studied by real time PCR. For this purpose,
human monocytes (THP-1 cells) were differentiated into macrophages
using PMA (100 ng/mL) for 24 h. Following differentiation the cells
were treated with membrane-coated nanoparticles. Bacterial LPS (500
ng/mL) was used as a positive control for the experiment. Following
treatment, RNA was isolated using a TRI Reagent (Sigma) and cDNA was
synthesized using a Bio-Rad cDNA synthesis kit. Real time PCR was
performed (Rotor, GeneQ, Qiagen) using glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate
dehydrogenase as an internal control and the expression of interleukins-IL6
and IL1β was studied with quantitative PCR.

Hemocompatibility
Studies
For hemocompatibility testing,
1 mL blood was centrifuged at 1000 RCF for 5 min and the supernatant
was discarded. To the pellet, 1 mL PBS was added and centrifuged again.
Finally, the freshly isolated RBCs were incubated on ice for 3 h with
the macrophage membrane-coated nanoparticle, 0.1% Triton (positive
control), and PBS (negative control). Percentage hemolysis was measured
by recording the absorbance at 550 nm, considering 100% hemolysis
with the Triton X sample.

Stability Study of the Nanoassembly
The stability of
the nanoassembly was studied, by recording DLS by a PerkinElmer Lambda
25 spectrophotometer over a period of consecutive 7 days.

Cytotoxicity
Studies
In order to study the therapeutic
potential of the fabricated module, HeLa, MCF7, and MDA-MB-231 cells
were seeded in 96-well plates and treated with increasing concentration
of macrophage membrane-coated nanoparticles. After 48 h, cell viability
was assessed using colorimetric MTT assay. For this, the treated cells
were incubated with 0.5 mg/mL MTT in DMEM for 2 h. Subsequently, MTT
was removed and 150 μL of organic solvent dimethyl sulfoxide
was added followed by 10 min of incubation. Absorbance was recorded
using a multiplate reader (Tecan) at 590 and 630 nm as background.
Cell viability percentage was calculated. To understand whether the
nanoassembly retained its activity, the synthesized the membrane-coated
nanoparticles were stored for 7 days in 4 °C. After 7 days, cytotoxicity
assay was performed on HeLa cells. To ascertain specific role of transmembrane
TNFα, the nanoassembly was also preincubated for 1 h in rocking
condition at room temperature in presence of the anti-TNFα antibody.
Thereafter, HeLa cells, seeded at a density of 5 × 103 cells/well, were treated with only the nanoassembly and with the
antibody-treated nanoassembly for a period of 48 h. Subsequently,
MTT assay was performed for both of the treatment groups and absorbance
was recorded at 590 nm.

Calcein AM/PI Dual Staining
To qualitatively
evaluate
the mode of cell death differential staining was performed. HeLa cells
were treated with the nanoassembly for 48 h. Following treatment,
the media was removed and the cells were gently washed with 100 μL
of PBS. Thereafter, calcein AM/PI solution was added in the final
concentrations of 2 and 4 μm followed by a 30 min incubation
in the dark. The cells were the visualized by a confocal microscope
(Zeiss LSM 880).

Caspase 3/Caspase 7 Assay
Activation
of effector caspases
after treatment was studied with a CellEvent Caspase-3/7 Green Detection
Reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific). For this, HeLa cells were seeded
at a density of 5 × 103 cells/well in a 96-well plate.
Following 24 h of treatment, 100 μL of diluted reagent solution
(4 μM) was added and incubated for 30 min. Subsequently, the
cells were imaged using a confocal microscope (Zeiss LSM 880).

Generation
of 3D Tumor Spheroids of HeLa Cells
To create
three-dimensional spheroids, 96-well plates were precoated with serum-free
media containing 1.5% (w/v) agarose. HeLa cells were seeded at a density
of 2 × 104 cells/well in an agarose precoated plate
with a final media volume of 200 μL. Subsequently, the plates
were centrifuged at 1500g for 10 min to form aggregates
and incubated at 37° with 5% CO2 in a humidified atmosphere.

Assessment of Viability of the Spheroids
Three days
old spheroids were treated with increasing concentrations of the nanoassembly.
Following 72 h of treatment, resazurin disodium salt was added to
each well and incubated for 4 h in a CO2 incubator at 37
°C. Thereafter, absorbance at 570 nm was measured using a multiplate
reader. Live/dead cell imaging of the treated spheroids were carried
out with 2 μM calcein-AM and 4 μM PI, respectively. Following
30 min of incubation, the spheroids were washed with PBS and imaged
using a confocal microscope (Zeiss LSM 880).
