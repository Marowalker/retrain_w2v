The
chemical synthesis of a adenosine triphosphate analogue, 1-adenosin-5′-yl
3-(3-methylbut-2-enyl) triphosphoric acid diester (ApppD), is described.
ApppD is known to be an active metabolite of the mevalonate pathway
in the human body like its structural isomer isopentenyl ester of
ATP (ApppI). Very recently, ApppI has been found to possess novel
function(s); now it will also be possible to examine the effects of
ApppD more precisely because it can be synthesized in reasonable amounts.
1-Adenosin-5′-yl 3-(3-methylbut-2-enyl) diphosphoric acid diester
(AppD; a adenosine diphosphate analogue) was also isolated from the
synthesis mixture. Both ApppD and AppD were characterized by 1H, 13C, 31P NMR and mass spectrometry
methods.

Introduction
It is clear that osteoporosis
is one of the diseases becoming increasingly
prevalent in the developed countries; that is, it is associated with
advanced age and nowadays global lifespans are expanding. Bisphosphonates
(BPs), which are stable analogues of the pyrophosphate naturally found
in cells, have been used for decades in the treatment of osteoporosis
and many other bone-related diseases, such as hypercalcemia and Paget’s
disease.1,2 In 1969, first-generation BPs were found
to have therapeutic properties; these were “simple”
non-nitrogen-containing BPs (non-NBPs) such as etidronate and clodronate
(see Figure 1). It
has been shown that pyrophosphate influences the formation and dissolution
of hydroxyapatite, which is a major component of bone mineral.3 Earlier, the mechanism of action of these first-generation
BPs (non-NBPs) was proposed to rely on their binding to the surface
of bone; however, in 1992 non-NBPs such as clodronate were shown to
form adenosine triphosphate (ATP) analogues, which could induce the
apoptosis of osteoclasts (bone-absorbing cells).4,5 After
the second-generation nitrogen-containing BPs (NBPs), such as pamidronate,
alendronate, and risedronate (see Figure 1), were synthesized, their mechanism of action
was found to be different from that of the non-NBPs; these compounds
were shown to prevent protein isoprenylation by inhibiting farnesyl
pyrophosphate synthase (FPPS) in the mevalonate pathway.6,7 FPPS catalyzes the condensation of dimethylallyl pyrophosphate with
isopentenyl pyrophosphate to form first geranyl pyrophosphate and
then FPP (see structures in Figure 2), a metabolite which is vital for protein prenylation
and cell signaling.8 In 2006, Mönkkönen
et al. reported that administration of NBPs led to the formation of
an ATP analogue, the isopentenyl ester of ATP (ApppI, Figure 2), which induced cell death.9 There is convincing evidence that NBPs also possess
anticancer effects; regarding this property, the mechanism of
action has been proposed to be attributable to the metabolites described
above.10

1-Adenosin-5′-yl 3-(3-methylbut-2-enyl)
triphosphoric acid
diester (ApppD) is a structural isomer of ApppI, and it is also one
of the metabolites induced by NBPs; actually, it has been reported
that the cellular ApppD concentration is over double that of ApppI
after treatment with NBPs.11 Because ApppI
has become rather widely available during recent years,12−14 more studies related to this have been performed, leading to the
publication of some interesting and unexpected results. For example,
very recently, Ishchenko et al. showed that ApppI could evoke a calcium-dependent
inhibition of pain sensation.15 In contrast,
little is known about the effects of ApppD in biological systems,
as this compound has been hardly available to bioscientists.

Results
and Discussion
The methods for the preparation of ATP γ-O-alkyl
esters have
been reported.16−18 According to SciFinder search, the chemical synthesis
of ApppD has not been reported earlier; there is only one paper describing
the preparation of ApppD by ligases.19 In
principal, there are two possible ways to prepare ATP derivatives
such as ApppI: (1) using an activated ADP (adenosine diphosphate)
derivative with the appropriate monophosphate derivative as starting
materials or (2) using the tetrabutylammonium (TBA) salt of ATP and
an appropriate tosylated (mesylated) alcohol or alkylhalide.20,12 One intriguing method for the future would also be the possibility
to synthesize ApppD from ApppI, either chemically or enzymatically.
Both of the above-mentioned approaches were tested. First, the preparation
of tosylated 3,3-dimethylallyl alcohol [(H3C)2C=CCH2OTs] was tested, a compound which would be
an excellent starting material along with an ATP TBA salt from which
to prepare ApppD; this has been the approach used when ApppI is synthesized
with an appropriate tosylated alcohol.12 Unfortunately, this was not possible because according to 1H NMR spectrum, there had been degradation of the desired product
during the purification by column chromatography. Furthermore, an
extensive literature search (with SciFinder) failed to locate any
mentions of tosylated 3,3-dimethylallyl alcohol. The situation was
identical when striving to isolate the mesylated derivative. Next,
an ATP TBA salt was prepared and a reaction was attempted with the
commercially available 3,3-dimethylallyl bromide [(H3C)2C=CCH2Br] in anhydrous acetonitrile at 45
°C, but again without success, even though this kind of method
has been reported to produce an isoprenoid conjugate of ADP.21 Then, the preparation of an appropriate monophosphate
starting material [(H3C)2C=CCH2OP(O)(MeO)2] was tried, a compound which could then react
with the ADP TBA salt via a few more synthesis steps, according to
a procedure reported elsewhere.12 Dimethyl
phosphate (commercially available) was first converted to its TBA
salt and dissolved in anhydrous acetonitrile, 3,3-dimethylallyl bromide
was added, and the reaction mixture was stirred for overnight at 50
°C, but according to 1H and 31P NMR spectra,
no reaction occurred. In addition, Ag2CO3 was
tested with dimethyl phosphate and 3,3-dimethylallyl bromide under
the same conditions mentioned above because of our earlier positive
experience with Ag2CO3 for the preparation of
etidronate prodrugs,22 however, again without
success. Finally, it was tested what would happen with the ATP TBA
salt, Ag2CO3, and 3,3-dimethylallyl bromide
in anhydrous acetonitrile at 45 °C, and this approach was successful
(see Scheme 1). The
synthesis was repeated several times to be sure that it was not some
kind of “accident”; this was not the case, the synthesis
worked rather well in all runs. The overall yield for ApppD was only
about 21%; this is reasonable for this kind of compound and comparable
to the results reported elsewhere for ApppI.12−14

Scheme 1 Synthesis
of ApppD
It can be proposed
that the driving force for the synthesis of
ApppD in the method reported here is the formation of an extremely
stable and (water) insoluble AgBr. The crude reaction mixture was
successfully purified by high-performance countercurrent chromatography
(HPCCC) using exactly the same method described elsewhere.14 Interestingly, the method reported here for
the synthesis of ApppD also resulted in the formation of 1-adenosin-5′-yl
3-(3-methylbut-2-enyl) diphosphoric acid diester (AppD; see the structure
in Figure 3); this
compound could be isolated by HPCCC purification of the crude reaction
mixture as a side-product (see HPCCC chromatogram in the Supporting Information). The observed ratio of
TBA/ApppD was higher than the ratio of TBA/ATP used in the synthesis,
and it can be different in the different HPCCC runs. The TBA content
in the final product also exceeded the maximum number of anionic sites
in ApppD (which is 3). This suggests that TBA is not solely acting
as a counterion, but it is also exerting some of its generally recognized
solvation effects in the purification process. The same phenomenon
was observed previously in the purification of ApppI by HPCCC.14

Figure 3 Structure of AppD.

Conclusions
The chemical synthesis of ApppD has been reported
for the first
time with a reasonable, 21%, overall yield. ApppD is the active metabolite
of the mevalonate pathway with high biological importance. Ongoing
biological studies with ApppD and ApppI will clarify their importance
and physiological actions more precisely. The newly isolated side-product,
AppD, may also have importance in some biological systems.

Experimental
Section
1H, 31P, and 13C
NMR spectra were
recorded on a 600 MHz spectrometer operating at 600.2, 243.0, and
150.9 MHz, respectively. The solvent (D2O) residual peak
was used as a standard for 1H measurement, which could
be referred to as 4.79 ppm. CD3OD was added as a standard
(49.00 ppm)23 for 13C measurement
with 85% H3PO4 being used as an external standard
in the 31P measurements. The nJHP couplings were calculated from proton spectra, and
all J values are given in hertz. The nJCP couplings were calculated
from carbon spectra with the coupling constants given in parenthesis
as hertz. An HPCCC method reported elsewhere was used in the purification
of ApppD and AppD.14 Mass spectra were
recorded on a quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer (qTOF-MS)
using electrospray ionization (ESI) in the negative ionization mode.
The purity of the products was determined from 1H and 31P NMR spectra and was ≥95% unless stated otherwise.

Synthesis
and Purification of the ApppD TBA Salt
A
commercially available ATP disodium salt (200 mg, 0.36 mmol) was dissolved
in distilled water (4 mL), and then freshly washed Dowex H+ resin (1.0 g) was added and the reaction mixture was stirred for
5–6 min before rapid filtration of Dowex, which was washed
with water (3–4 mL). The commercially available 40% TBA hydroxide
in water (705 μL, 3.0 equiv) was added to the combined water
fractions, and the reaction mixture was stirred for a few minutes
before evaporation to dryness under high vacuum. The residue was dried
carefully for a few days under high vacuum with warming before it
was dissolved in anhydrous DMF (2–3 mL); Ag2CO3 (51 mg, 0.18 mmol, 0.5 equiv) and finally 3,3-dimethylallyl
bromide (84 mg, 65 μL, 0.56 mmol, ca. 1.5 equiv) were added,
and the reaction mixture was stirred for 24 h at 45 °C in the dark. The reaction mixture was filtered and the filtrate
was evaporated to dryness in vacuo. The residue was dissolved in MeOH
(3–4 mL), water (ca. 0.5–1 mL) was added [after the
water addition and vortexing, fine slightly yellow solids were formed
(most probably AgBr)], and the mixture was centrifuged to remove all
solids and subsequently evaporated to dryness in vacuo. A crude product
(505 mg) was obtained as a white “foamy” solid (highly
hygroscopic!). The crude product was purified by exactly the same HPCCC method as utilized in the purification of ApppI.14 Appropriate fractions were collected and evaporated
to dryness in vacuo (see HPCCC chromatogram in the Supporting Information as an example). ApppD × 4.1 TBA
salt (117
mg, 21%) was obtained as a colorless solid (highly hygroscopic!).
