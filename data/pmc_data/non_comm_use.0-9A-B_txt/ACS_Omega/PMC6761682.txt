A novel
flexible ion-selective sensor for potassium and sodium
detection was proposed. Flexible ion-selective electrodes with pseudo-liquid
internal solution on contrary to the system with a solid contact provided
a more stable analytical signal. Such advantages were achieved because
of polyelectrolyte (PEI/PSS) layers adsorption on the conduct substrate with
a layer-by-layer technique. Such an approach demonstrated that ion-selective
electrodes save sensitivity with Nernstian dependence: 56.2 ±
1.4 mV/dec aNa+ and 56.3 ±
1.9 mV/dec aK+, as well as
a fast time of response for potassium (5 s) and sodium (8 s) was shown.
The sensing platform proposed demonstrates a better time of response
and is close to the Nernstian value of sensitivity with a sensor low
cost. The results proposed confirm a pseudo-liquid junction for the
ion-selective electrode. Biocompatibility of an ion-selective sensing
platform was demonstrated at potassium potentiometric measurements
in Escherichia coli biofilms. Potassium
levels in a biofilm were measured with potentiometry and showed agreement
with the previous results.

Introduction
Real-time, wearable, minimally invasive
monitoring is used in medical
diagnosis and professional sport.1−5 The application on sensors becomes hard because of dilution of the
biomarkers of interest, as well as variability in salinity, pH, and
other physicochemical variables which directly impact the readout
of real-time biosensors.6−13 Such parameters as sodium (Na+),14 potassium (K+),15 calcium
(Ca2+), and others16−18 are analyzed in professional
sports. Electrolyte ions in aqueous solutions are usually measured
using a potentiometric method with ion-sensitive membranes.18 Potentiometric ion-selective electrodes (ISEs)
have already been in use for half-a-century, mainly in physiological
studies.19 Typical ISEs are liquid contact
electrodes. Until recently, ISE devices were noncompatible with the
principles of miniaturization and portability. Both the internal solution
and the internal electrode are strived to be eliminated to be replaced
by the solid contact.20,21 However, elimination of the internal
reference system and its replacement with the solid contact resulted
in insufficient long-term stability of ISE potentials and in poor
piece-to-piece reproducibility.19,22 We suppose that polyelectrolyte
multilayers formed by layer-by-layer assembly23,24 have hydration activity25−28 and can serve as the inner electrode solution in
potentiometric sensors.29−31 This paper describes the design
and fabrication of a flexible ion-sensing electrochemical adhesive
tape (AT)-based analytical device for potentiometric measurements
of potassium and sodium ions. This sensing platform has a carbon AT
that contains ISEs with conventional ion-selective membranes (ISMs)
immobilized within a polyelectrolyte multilayer as the pseudo-inner
solution and ion-to-electron transducer. Within the polyelectrolyte
layers, potassium chloride is used as an ion source. Carbon ATs are
cheap flexible electronic conductors. The required selectivity for
the target analyte is achieved by using a suitable ionophore.

Because of unique properties such as light weight, low cost, high
flexibility, excellent elasticity, and figure moulding, the flexible
carbon conductive AT could serve as an ideal platform for personalized
wearable devices.

Results and Discussion
Flexible
ISEs consisted of ISMs and ATs modified through lipid
and polyelectrolyte layers (Figure 1a–e). The adhesive carbon tape was used as a
substrate because of its mechanical reliability, adhesive effect,
and conductivity. Carbon conductivity allows this material to be used
as an inner electrode.32 The scheme of
the ion-selective AT used as a flexible conducting platform (0.8 ×
3.5 cm) is presented in Figure 1d.

Deposition of the polyelectrolyte
layers was carried out by a layer-by-layer
method,26,33 which is more preferable for polyelectrolyte
adsorption, as it does not require specific expensive equipment31 and is more accessible. This method allows to
create fairly uniform and thin films on the surface of the substrate.
The number of layers was taken from the literature data.

The
polyelectrolyte layers were deposited on the substrates with
a partially negative or positive charge.34 The surface of the AT did not have a partial charge; therefore,
to obtain polyelectrolyte composites, lipid vesicles were deposited
as the first modifying layer.35 The stage
of the lipid layer setting was monitored by measuring the water contact
angle. As seen from Figure 2, a hydrophobic substrate with a water contact angle of 100–110°
(Figure 2a) became
more hydrophilic with a contact angle of 82–84° after
the assembly of the lipid layer (Figure 2b). Overlaying the lipid layer gave better
wettability of the AT. Hydrophobic hydrocarbon tails were attached
to the surface of the AT, and hydrophilic negatively charged heads
were faced outside and interacted with the positively charged polyelectrolytes.
When the positively charged (PEI) polyelectrolytes assembled on the
lipid layer, the contact angle slightly increased (Figure 2c), but after adsorption of
the PSS (negatively charged polyelectrolyte), the contact angle decreased
to 79–78° (Figure 2d).

AFM images of (i) AT/lip/PEI, (j) ITO/lip/PEI, (k) ITO/lip/PEI/PSS.

Each step of the multilayer architecture assembly
was controlled
by morphology by atomic force microscopy (AFM).36 This method allows the control of surface parameters such
as roughness and smoothness. These characteristics influence further
stages of surface modification. For the ISM immobilization need not
only be wetted surface but uniform. According to the AFM data on the
surface of the AT, it is not always possible to create a sufficiently
even layer of polyelectrolytes. This could be explained by the original
structure of the AT surface. As can be seen from Figure 2e, a layer of glue on the surface
of the substrate applied to the carbon tape rather unevenly. The thickness
of the adhesive in some places of the AT sometimes exceeds the thickness
of the polyelectrolyte layer, therefore, it is not possible to see
the real structure of the substrate surface with polyelectrolytes
deposited. In order to compare the AFM images obtained for the AT,
AFM photographs with polyelectrolyte layers, deposited on the indium
tin oxide (ITO) flexible substrate, were removed. As seen from Figure 2i–k, the structure
of the deposited polyelectrolytes on the AT and on the substrate is
quite similar. Thus, according to the AFM data obtained for the two
different substrates with the same quantity of polyelectrolytes, the
PEI layer is deposited on the substrate by small conglomerates, and
the PSS layer precipitates fairly evenly. Deposition of polyelectrolyte
layers on top of the AT/lipid layer composite leads to an increase
of roughness.

The adsorbed polyelectrolyte layers are hydrated25,37 and can be used as a liquid internal reference system. For this
purpose, we provide polyelectrolyte layer adsorption from the potassium
chloride decimolar solution. This technique allows adding more water
in a layer as polyelectrolytes swell38 in
saline solution. The number of layers was set to form a charge barrier
between the inner solution and membrane.39 PEI,39 as the positively charged polyelectrolyte,
prevents diffusion of potassium ions from the inner solution to outer
media. This approach allows stable pseudo-inner electrode potential.
Thus, we used consistent PEI/PSS/PEI layers. To avoid capacitor-like
behavior, we did not prepare more layers. By adding potassium chloride
into the polyelectrolyte layer, we achieved the pseudo-internal solution
as a part of ISEs. This pseudo-internal electrode solution coupled
with a carbon paste on the AT forms an ion-to-electron transfer system.
This approach enables the production of low cost ISEs with high potential
stability and signal reproducibility.

The potentiometric measurements
of electrolytes such as K+ and Na+ require the
addition of an ISM which is generally
a plasticized polymer doped with an ionophore. It is a compound that
can selectively bind to the ions of interest via coordinate bonds.
In our investigation, an ISM was prepared by mixing a polymeric phase
(PVC) with a plasticizer (o-NPOE). To make this material
sensitive to Na+ and K+ ions, it was doped with
a highly hydrophobic ionic site (KTpCIPB), sodium ionophore X, and
potassium ionophore I, respectively. AT-based ISEs for two target
analytes, namely, K+ and Na+, were prepared
and tested individually.

In each experiment, potassium and sodium
ISEs were dipped into
standard solutions of salt (NaCl and KCl respectively), while the
concentration of the solution was changed in steps and the open-circuit
potentials were monitored continuously using a potentiostat. Electromotive
force (EMF) was measured between the ISE and a commercial Ag/AgCl
reference electrode. Both Figures 3a and 4a show the time trace
of potentiometric response for the prepared AT-based electrodes of
K+ and Na+ ions, when the activity of the primary
analyte increased. K+ ion concentration in human sweat
lies in the range of 1 to 16 mM. The calibration plots for potassium
ions (Figure 3b) show
a Nernstian response between 10–3 and 10–1 M indicating that the membrane is working as expected.

calibration plot after addition of the standard sodium chloride solution

The method of preparation and deposition of the ISM on AT/Lip/Poly
was found to have an effect on sensor performance. The best sensitivity
(56.3 ± 1.9 mV/decade) and stability of potential were obtained
using a polymerization method in a thin film (Figure 3a–c). From the above, it was concluded
that it is better to make a membrane in a Petri dish (Figure 3d–f).

Na+ ion concentration in human sweat is in the range
of 10 to 160 mM (Figure 4b). Average sensitivity of ISEs in this range (10–4 to 1 M) was found to be 56.2 ± 1.4 mV/decade, which was close
to the value expected for the detection of monovalent ions using ideal
ISMs (59.2 mV/decade) (Figure 4b). Analytical characteristics of ISEs are shown in Table 1. The results obtained
showed good agreement with the literature.20,40 The proposed sensing platform demonstrated a better time of response
and was close to the Nernstian value of sensitivity with a low sensor
cost. The results confirm the proposed pseudo-liquid junction for
the ISE. The sodium ISE demonstrates lower response time in comparison
with the carbon tattoo sensor of the solid contact type.41 Sensitivity of the proposed sodium sensor is
close to other sensors based on the same carbon material17,41,42 and flexible textile.43 Linear range for sodium potentiometric sensor
was higher, because was constructed pseudo-inner solution, which provide
stable work of sensor. This pseudo-inner solution potassium ISE showed
a much lower response time (5 s) in contrast with the carbon textile-based
ion-selective sensor (60 s).44 Sensitivity,
limit of detection, and linear range of the potassium-selective electrode
with pseudo-inner solution were compared with ion-selective solid
contact sensors based on carbon42−44 and flexible substrates such
as textile43 and cotton.44

To demonstrate sensor application for monitoring in
real samples,
oscillations45 in the bacteria biofilm
under expansion were observed.46 Such oscillations
are usually observed by using a Nernstian fluorescent dye.47 Bacteria have many ion channels, such as sodium,
chloride, calcium-gated, and potassium ones and ionotropic glutamate
receptors, similar to those found in neurons. Escherichia
coli was used to control potassium ions under biofilm
living. For this purpose, the biofilm was directly grown on the ISE
surface. EMF was refined because of resistance increase before measurements
and after biofilm growth. Then, potentiometric measurements of such
systems were provided (Figure 5). Standard potassium chloride (0.1 M, 100 μL) addition
to bacteria was performed to create disturbance. According to the
potassium ISE calibration curve, potassium concentration in the biofilm
was calculated and established as 190 mM. This value corresponds with
the potassium level in the biofilm, varying from 200 to 400 mM,48 found in the literature. After standard potassium
addition, its concentration increased dramatically to 1.3 M. Such
essential and disproportional potassium levels could be explained
with potassium pumping by the biofilm from the solution to the gap
between the ISE and biofilm. Nevertheless, the proposed sensor demonstrated
good stability and biocompatibility during measurements, as the E. coli biofilm showed life-sustaining activity after
potentiometric measurements (Figure 5b).

Conclusions
We offer a wearable
sensor by using PEI/PSS multilayers as inner
ISE solution together with a low-cost adhesive carbon tape as a sensitive
transducer. Its high sensitivity and durability are obtained using
a novel approach to the preparation of polyelectrolyte multilayers
as a unique platform for sensing application. The sodium and potassium
ion-selective sensor shows combined superiority of high sensitivity,
fast response, and high durability. In addition, the low-cost strain
sensor based on the adhesive carbon tape shows sensitive response
to bacteria potassium oscillations. This wearable sensing platform
can monitor various human health indicators, including electrolytes.
The sensitivity and suitability for making potentiometric sensors
of the demonstrated sensing platform may enable a wide range of applications
in intelligent devices.

Methods
Chemicals
Valinomycin
(potassium ionophore I), 4-tert-butylcalix[4]arene-tetraacetic
acid tetraethyl ester
(sodium ionophore X), potassium tetrakis(4-chlorophenyl)borate (KTpCIPB),
2-nitrophenyl octyl ether (o-NPOE), and poly(vinyl
chloride) high molecular weight (PVC) were all purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.
Tetrahydrofuran (THF) and hexane were purchased from Ekos-1, Russia.
Potassium chloride (KCl), sodium chloride (NaCl), and phosphate-buffered
saline were from Merk. Liquid soya lecithin Lecisoy 400 was purchased
from Cargill, USA. Branched polyethyleneimine (PEI, Mw 70 kDa) 30% water solution was purchased from Alfa Aesar,
and polysterenesulfonate (PSS, Mw 500
kDa)—from Polysciences, Inc.

Fabrication of the AT-Based
Platform (ATP)
A conventional
conductive double-sided carbon tape (8 mm width, 3.5 cm height, 150
μm thickness) purchased from Tescan (Czech Republic) was used
as the initial substrate. To increase the hydrophilicity the AT was
immersed in a dispersion of lipid vesicles.

To prepare small
unilamellar vesicle (SUV) solution, the following procedure was performed:
soy lecithin solution in hexane (10 mg mL–1) was
kept under vacuum for solvent evaporation at least for 3 h. After
removing any hexane traces, a thin lipid film on the bottom of the
vessel was obtained. The resulting lipid film was rehydrated by using
distilled water for final 10 mg/mL concentration with simultaneous
sonication in an ultrasonic bath for 15 min.

To obtain the results,
the lipid bilayer on top of the conductive
double-sided adhesive carbon tape was immersed in a 10 mg/mL dispersion
of SUV for 1 h. Vesicles attached to the oppositely charged surface
of the AT then ruptured, fused, and spread on the surface forming
a continuous bilayer. The procedure described was followed by rinsing
with large quantity of distilled water and drying under an air steam.

The polyelectrolyte multilayer film was deposited on top of the
lipid bilayer. Polyelectrolytes films were assembled using a layer-by-layer
technique. Three layers of positively charged PEI and negatively charged
PSS were assembled from solutions with a polyelectrolyte concentration
of 2 mg mL–1 in 0.1 M KCl. A concentration of 2
mg/mL of polyelectrolytes was used, as it gives optimum thickness
films. For each layer deposition, surfaces were incubated during 15
min at room temperature in the polyelectrolyte solution. Each step
of polyelectrolyte deposition was followed by a washing step with
distilled water.

Fabrication of the ISM
The potassium
ISM contained
1.4 wt % of valinomycin, 0.3 wt % of KTpCIPB, 32.8 wt % of PVC, and
65.5 wt % NPOE. The sodium ISM contained 0.99 wt % of sodium ionophore
X, 0.25 wt % of KTpClPB, 32.92 wt % of PVC, and 65.84 wt % of o-NPOE. The membranes were prepared by dissolving the mixture
into 1.5–4 mL of THF. ISM coatings on the ATP were prepared
by two different methods: drop casting and thin film polymerization.
For thin film polymerization, we poured the THF solution into a Petri
dish and allowed the THF to evaporate over 24 h. We then cut the membrane
into small circular pieces (3 mm in diameter) and conditioned them
by soaking overnight in chloride solutions of the corresponding ions
(10–3 M K+, 10–1 M
Na+). A volume of 40 μL of the membrane cocktail
was applied at once by drop casting onto the electrode (into the orifice
left by the plastic mask). The membrane was dried for 24 h. The volume
of the membrane cocktail applied was optimized for the fabrication
of a membrane approximately 3 mm in diameter. The electrodes were
conditioned in proper saline solution: 0.001 M KCl or 0.1 NaCl prior
to and between measurements, which were performed at room temperature.

E. coli ATCC Growing on the Potassium
ISE
E. coli ATCC night culture
was used for biofilm preparation. The biofilm was grown on the potassium
ISE for 24 h at 38 °C in an LB broth (LENNOX). Prior to potentiometric
measurements, the ISE with the biofilm was rinsed with deionized water.

Characterization of the AT-Based ISE
Characterization
of the electrode surface morphology was observed by using an atomic
force microscope Solver Next (NT-MDT, Russia) in semi-contact mode.
Wettability of the obtained composites was characterized by contact
angle measurements using a drop shape analyzer Kruss DSA25 (Germany).

Electrochemical measurements were performed using a CompactStat
instrument (Ivium, Netherlands) in a standard two-electrode cell at
room temperature (22 °C). The AT-based electrode was used as
the working electrode and a 3 M Ag/AgCl/KCl (type 6.0733.100, Metrohm
AG) as the reference electrode. The membrane was fully covered by
the solution, but there was no direct contact between the exposed
carbon adhesive-tape and the solution. The activity coefficients were
calculated by the Debye–Hückel approximation. After
the measurements, the electrodes were air-dried and stored with using
storage corresponding salt solution. Several calibration curves with
the primary analyte in highly concentrated background standard solutions
(1–16 mM for potassium ions, 20–160 mM for sodium ions)
were prepared. Knowing the concentration of the standard solutions
and the limit of detection, the selectivity coefficient was obtained.
The electrochemical cell volume was 20 mL. The background solution
for bacteria measurements was phosphate-buffered solution (pH 7.2).
