Chiral
dienes are useful ligands in a number of asymmetric transition-metal-catalyzed
reactions. Here, we evaluate the efficiency of 2,5-disubstituted 1,3a,4,6a-tetrahydropentalenes as ligands
to rhodium(I). 2,5-Dibenzyl and diphenyl tetrahydropentalenes were
synthesized in two steps and resolved, either chromatographically,
or through fractional crystallization of diastereomeric rhodium(I)
salts. When evaluated in a 1,4-arylation reaction, the 2,5-dibenzyl
ligand gave up to 99% ee. The use of a well-defined rhodium complex
as catalyst, Cs2CO3 as the base, and toluene/water
as solvent was found to have a pronounced beneficial effect on the
selectivity of the reaction. The homologous 2,5-diphenyl ligand on
the other hand proved to be highly prone to racemization/loss of chirality
during catalysis. Control experiments reveal that this rearrangement
proceeds via a rhodium-mediated 1,3-hydride shift. Implications for
ligand design and catalysis are discussed.

Introduction
Chiral bis-μ2 diene ligands have a broad utility
in asymmetric catalysis.1,2 Exceptional levels of
enantiodiscrimination have been achieved, particularly in rhodium3 and iridium4 catalysis,
but also with metals like palladium5 and
ruthenium.6,7 Examples are plentiful and include C–C
bond forming reactions
like cross-couplings,5b asymmetric cyclizations,4b hydroacylations,7a polymerizations,7b and cyclopropanations,7c as well as strategy-level reactions like cycloadditions.8 Ligands of this type have found particular use
in variations of asymmetric arylation reactions.9−11

Due to
the unfunctionalized nature of most diene ligands beyond
the metal-binding motif, synthesis and resolution is challenging.
As a consequence, fewer ligands of this type are available compared
to other ligand classes. With new applications of diene catalysts
continuing to emerge, there is a need for expanding the library of
efficient and readily available ligands of this type. A hydrocarbon
framework with utility in this context is the 1,3a,4,6a-tetrahydropentalene structure. With substituents
at the 3 and 6 positions, this structure was independently developed
as an efficient ligand in asymmetric catalysis by Laschat and Lin/Xu
(Figure 1).12 Recently, computational studies by Kantchev
have suggested that a variation on this theme, a repositioning of
the steering substituents from 3,6- to 2,5-positions would significantly
enhance the enantioselectivity in catalysis. In particular, ee’s
in excess of 99.9% were predicted in Hayashi–Miyaura-type arylation
reactions with 3b as the steering ligand.13 This unusually high selectivity would originate
from a beneficial cooperative effect of the large torsional twist
angle between the coordinating olefins (C2–C3–C6–C5)14 and a favorable positioning of the steering
substituents for steric interactions with the enone substrates.a,14b

and parallel coordinating olefins. (a) Reported

As part of our program for developing chiral [8]annulene-type
ligands
like 2 for asymmetric catalysis,15 we became interested in evaluating also the 2,5-disubstituted tetrahydropentalene
framework. Structures of this type are interesting, not least because
the twisted olefin geometry represents a complimentary extreme to
the parallel olefins of both dibenzo[a,e]cyclooctatetraenes and more commonly studied norbornadiene16 and bicyclo[2.2.2]octa-2,5-diene-type ligands.17

Moreover, tetrahydropentalenes with this
pattern of substitution
are intriguing from a stereochemical viewpoint as the steering substituents
are positioned on a pseudoplane of symmetry in the ligand framework
and mirror symmetry is broken only by the orientation of the olefins.
During the preparation of this manuscript, an independent study on
this topic was reported by Laschat and co-workers.18 In light of this study, we here present our approach to
enantiomerically pure di-μ-chlorobis rhodium(I) complexes of 3a and 3b, and the evaluation of these in asymmetric
catalysis. Using a well-defined rhodium complex of 3a as catalyst, up to 99% ee was achieved in a 1,4-arylation reaction,
which is higher than what was previously reported. The corresponding
diphenyl substituted 3b gave a modest 44% ee when evaluated
in the same context. A series of control experiments reveal that a
facile racemization of 3b via an allylic C–H insertion/olefin
isomerization process during catalysis accounts for the low selectivity.

Results
and Discussion
At the outset, we envisioned a divergent synthesis
where the steering
substituents of the 2,5-disubstituted tetrahydropentalene framework
would be installed by cross-coupling reactions. To this end, ditriflate 5 was targeted. In practice, this compound was synthesized
in a single step from the commercially available Weiss ketone (4)19,20 by trapping a dienolate with N-(2-pyridyl)bis(trifluoromethanesulfonimide) (Scheme 1). After screening
conditions with the aim of increasing the selectivity for the desired C2 symmetric dienolate, we found that treatment
of 4 with NaHMDS, in tetrahydrofuran (THF), at 0 °C
for 3 h followed by addition of the triflating reagent gave 5 and 6 in 86% yield with a useful 77/23 selectivity
in favor of the desired C2-symmetric 5. The regioisomers could be chromatographically separated
but were typically carried through the subsequent steps as a mixture.

Scheme 1 Synthesis of Enantiomerically Pure Catalysts 9a and 9b
(a) A 92:8 mixture of 5 and 6 was used as starting material; (b) yield given
for the shown diastereomer. See Supporting Information for details; (c) thermal ellipsoids shown at 30% probability. Hydrogen
atoms, noncoordinating counter ions, and solvate molecules are omitted
for clarity; (d) the stereochemical descriptor refers to the configuration
of the diene ligand.

A Negishi coupling with
BnZnBr using the PEPPSI–IPr catalyst
system then provided a mixture of 3a and 7 in a combined yield of 89%. A single-crystal X-ray diffraction (scXRD)
structure of rac-3a showed that the
structure adopts a folded shape similar to 1(12) with a pronounced 30° twist angle of the
olefins (defined by the torsion C2–C3–C6–C5).
The corresponding diphenyl ligand 3b was similarly synthesized
using the Kumada coupling.b,c It is noteworthy that even when using an essentially
pure sample of 5 for this cross coupling, the ratio of 3b–8 was not improved beyond 83:17. Presumably,
this is a result of a palladium-mediated olefin isomerization during
catalysis. In contrast, the isomeric ratio of the starting materials 5 and 6 was conserved in the product distribution
in the synthesis of 3a. Attempts to synthesize the corresponding
2,5-dimethyl and 2,5-diisopropyl ligands under the same conditions
proved unsuccessful despite extensive experimentation.

Resolution
of the dibenzyl ligand 3a was then readily
accomplished by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) on a
chiral stationary phase (Chiracel OJ-H, 250 × 10 mm2, 5 μm). The (S,S)-isomer
was obtained as a mixture with 7.

Ligand exchange
of chlorobis(ethylene)rhodium(I) dimer with (R,R)-3a proceeded cleanly
to give (R,R)-9a in
65% yield following recrystallization from chloroform/diethyl ether.
Complexation of the mixture of (S,S)-3a and 7 obtained from HPLC resolution
under the same conditions with an amount of rhodium corresponding
to the amount of 3a provided also (S,S)-9a after recrystallization. A scXRD
structure of (S,S)-9a was solved and the absolute configuration of this compound, and
by extension of 3a, was established from anomalous dispersion
(Flack = −0.03(3)). Structurally, a pronounced increase in
the folding angle between the two five-membered rings of the ligand,
resulting from coordination to the rhodium atom, is seen in 9a compared to free 3a. The torsion angle C3–C3a–C6a–C6
is reduced from 108° in 3a to 77° in 9a. This conformational change also reduces the twist angle
between the coordinating olefins to 22°.

For the resolution
of diphenyl ligand 3b, we employed
the Grützmachers method of fractional crystallization of diastereomeric
rhodium 2,2′-diamino-1,1′-binaphthyl (DABN) salts.21 This method could be used also for the resolution
of 3a, but due to the air sensitivity of rhodium complexes
with this ligand, chromatographic resolution was preferred. Thus,
di-μ-chlorobis rhodium dimer rac-9b was formed as a single detected diastereomer (1H NMR
spectroscopy) using a procedure similar to that of 9a. When performing the complexation from a mixture of rac-3b and 8, a complete selectivity for complexation
of 3b could be achieved by using a limiting amount of
the rhodium precursor. The structural assignment of rac-9b was corroborated by solving a scXRD structure.

Treatment of 9b with (+)-DABN in the presence of a
silver salt then gave the cationic complex 10 as a 50:50
mixture of diastereomers in essentially quantitative yield. Pleasingly,
the diastereomer with an (S,S)-configuration
of the ligand had a considerably lower solubility in chlorinated solvents
than the (R,R)-ligand diastereomer.
Recrystallization of this mixture from chloroform/benzene, followed
by trituration with chloroform, gave (S,S)-10 as a single detected diastereomer (1H NMR spectroscopy). A scXRD of this structure was solved, which
provided a stereochemical assignment using the absolute configuration
of the DABN moiety as a reference.

To complete the synthesis
of 9b, (S,S)-3b was first released from 10 by treatment with
1,5-cyclooctadiene (COD). A ligand exchange
with chlorobis(ethylene)rhodium dimer then provided (S,S)-9b in good yield. Attempts to convert
(S,S)-10 directly into
(S,S)-9b by treatment
with HCl proved unsuccessful. Instead, a mixture of 3b and 8 was recovered in a 79:21 ratio. Surprisingly, 3b obtained using this method was found to be essentially
racemic.d To investigate whether this isomerization
was Brønsted acid-catalyzed, the ligand was refluxed with p-toluene sulfonic acid in THF/D2O for 24 h.
No isomerization or deuterium incorporation electrospray ionization
mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) was observed in this experiment, which
implies that the isomerization was indeed mediated by rhodium.

A comparison between the solid-state structure of rac-9b and 9a revealed a highly similar binding
geometry: the olefin twist torsion in 9b was 23°
and the folding angle between the rings, 78°. In terms of stability,
crystalline 9b could be handled in air without visible
deterioration. Complex 9a, on the other hand, was found
to be prone to aging and was best prepared freshly or stored in a
glovebox to prevent deterioration over time.

With access to
both targeted catalysts 9a and 9b, we turned
to evaluate their respective catalytic properties.
For this purpose, the rhodium-catalyzed 1,4-addition of boronic acids
to cyclohexenone was selected as a suitable benchmark reaction. The
dibenzyl ligand complex 9a system was first evaluated
under a series of commonly employed conditions for this transformation
(Table 1). Previous
work achieved 41% ee, 25% yield, in this reaction by in situ complexation
of 3a to rhodium and using KOH as the base.19 We found that the combination of preformed 9a as a catalyst together with Cs2CO3 in toluene/water gave up to 99% ee. This constitutes synthetically
relevant levels of selectivity and is a significant enhancement compared
to what was previously reported. It seems likely that the key factor
behind this difference is the use of a well-defined preformed catalyst,
but the performance of the system is clearly also dependent on the
precise reaction conditions.22 The observed
level of selectivity with 9a is noteworthy also as it
supersedes the performance of 3,6-diphenyl 1,3a,4a,6-tetrahydropentalene 1 in the same reaction
(91% ee).

Good results were obtained in this reaction with electron-rich
and electron-deficient boronic acids. The sterically more demanding
2-tolueneboronic acid on the other hand gave lower yield and a selectivity
below 90% ee (Table 1, entries 7–9).12 On the balance
between operational simplicity, selectivity, and yield, the use of
a boroxine as the aryl source appears to be a good compromise (Table 1, entry 1).

The major product enantiomer of 11a showed an (R)-configuration in all entries using (R,R)-9a as the catalyst, which follows
the predictions of ref (13) and the Hayashi’s quadrant model for related diene-ligand
structures (see Supporting Information for
details).15

In stark contrast to
the excellent enantioselectivity of 9a, the homologous
diphenyl ligand complex 9b gave a modest 44% ee in the
same reaction (Scheme 2). Variations of the reaction conditions
and reagents neither significantly improved this outcome nor did a
switch to an aryl zinc reagent as the phenyl source. This surprisingly
low selectivity combined with the facile isomerization/racemization
of 3b upon treatment of 10 with HCl (vide
infra) was suggestive of a rhodium-mediated isomerization of the ligand
also during catalysis.23

Scheme 2 Catalytic Performance
of 9b in 1,4-Arylation of Cyclohexenone
To prove this possibility, we conducted a series
of control experiments.
First, we explored the possibility that the ligand was released from
rhodium during catalysis. We were however not able to induce a ligand
exchange of 9b even with large excess of cyclohexenone
or phenyl boronic acid. Moreover, no free ligand could be detected
in the reaction mixture during catalytic experiments with this complex
(thin-layer chromatography (TLC) control and 1H NMR spectroscopy
of the crude reaction mixture).

A catalytic experiment was then
conducted wherein the water was
replaced for D2O (Scheme 3, entry a). In this experiment, the ligand was also
released from rhodium by addition of COD to the reaction mixture after
full conversion of the starting materials was reached. From this experiment, 3b and 8 were obtained in a 28:72 ratio in favor
of the meso-ligand. Moreover, no deuterium incorporation into the
ligand framework could be detected by 1H NMR spectroscopy
or ESI-MS, which suggested that isomerization is a purely intramolecular
1,3-hydride shift mediated by the metal center. When conducting similar
experiments, but excluding individual components of the catalytic
mixture, only trace isomerization was seen (Scheme 3, entries b–d). Finally, 9b was found to not isomerize spontaneously when dissolved in organic
solvents and was also unable to catalyze the isomerization of free 3b, even under mild heating (50 °C).

Scheme 3 Control Experiments
to Elucidate the Reason for Low Selectivity in
1,4-Additions with 9b as the Catalyst
Combined, our interpretation of these experiments
is that isomerization/racemization
of 3b occurs during catalysis following the general mechanism
outlined in Scheme 4. Additional experiments are however needed to identify the precise
nature of the intermediate(s) capable of triggering the apparent C–H
insertion/hydride 1,3-migration.

Scheme 4 Proposed Mechanism for Loss of Stereochemical
Information in 9b
Given such processes are facilitated by increased electron
density
on the metal center,24 it seems reasonable
that intermediates like rhodium-oxa-allyl- and/or rhodium-phenyl complexes
are the culprits. The higher susceptibility toward isomerization of 3b compared to 3a is attributed to the inductive
electron-withdrawing nature of the phenyl substituent, which weakens
the allylic C–H bond, thus making it more electrophilic.

Conclusions
In summary, we have evaluated the potential of 2,5-disubstituted
1,3a,4,6a-tetrahydropentalenes to
induce asymmetry in rhodium(I) catalysis. The results show that with
an appropriate choice of steering substituents, here benzyl groups,
this ligand class is highly capable of biasing catalytic reactions
like the Hayashi–Miyaura 1,4 arylations with up to 99% ee.
A diphenyl-substituted ligand of the same type on the other hand proved
to be highly prone to loss of chirality/enantiomeric purity during
catalysis through a rhodium-mediated isomerization. This behavior
emphasizes the propensity of rhodium(I) to insert into allylic C–H
bonds of diene ligands as an important consideration in the design
of novel ligands of this type for transition-metal catalysis. On a
more general note, such intermediates are commonly invoked as catalyst
decomposition pathways, but are perhaps deserving of more consideration
also as intermediates in highly efficient catalyst systems: both as
off-cycle intermediates and to generate alternative catalytically
competent species through rearrangement of the ligand structure. This
study also exemplifies that purely theoretical predictions are useful
inspirational tool for discovery. It is however equally clear that
computational approaches are still limited when it comes to capturing
the full complexity of a catalytic system. Without experimental verification,
alternative reaction pathways such as the here described ligand racemization,
and the dependence of enantioselectivity on solvent, base, and phenyl
reagent are easily overlooked.

Finally, we envision that the
efficiency in catalysis, simple synthesis,
and straight forward resolution of dibenzyl ligand 3b will serve as inspiration for further refined ligands, and moreover
ligands of this type will find use in chemical synthesis and coordination
chemistry. Such investigations are ongoing in our laboratory and will
be reported in due course.

Experimental Section
General Information
Air- and moisture-sensitive reactions
were carried out in an oven-dried (>110 °C) glassware capped
with a rubber septum under a positive pressure of argon gas. Air-
and moisture-sensitive reagents, solvents, and solutions were transferred
via syringe or stainless-steel cannula under a dry argon atmosphere.
Commercial reagents and solvents were used as received without further
purification unless otherwise noted. Cyclohexenone was distilled using
a Hickman still prior to use. CH2Cl2, diethyl
ether, THF, toluene, n-hexane, and acetonitrile were
obtained from a dry solvent dispense system. Commercially available
metal salts were stored and handled in an argon-filled glovebox. Bicyclo[3.3.0]octane-3,7-dione
(4) was synthesized following a procedure by Weiss and
co-workers.20b1H NMR signals
were reported in chemical shifts downfield from SiMe4 using
the respective residual solvent peak as internal standard (chloroform
= 7.26 ppm; CH2Cl2 = 5.30 ppm; MeCN = 1.94 ppm)
and listed as follows: chemical shifts (δ, ppm), multiplicity,
coupling constant(s) in Hz, and integration. 13C NMR signals
were reported in chemical shifts downfield from SiMe4,
using the respective residual solvent peak as internal standard. (CDCl3 = 77.16 ppm; CD2Cl2 = 53.84 ppm; MeCN-d3 = 118.3 ppm). Unless otherwise indicated,
all products for which yields are given were >95% pure by 1H NMR spectroscopy and TLC (where applicable).

Sodium bis(trimethylsilyl)
amide (7.0 mL, 2M in THF, 14.0 mmol) was diluted with THF (100 mL)
and the resulting solution was cooled to 0 °C. A solution of
bicyclo[3.3.0]octane-3,7-dione (4) (643 mg, 4.65 mmol)
in THF (50 mL) was then added over 5 min. The resulting mixture was
stirred for 4 h at 0 °C, before a solution of N-(2-pyridyl)bis(trifluoromethanesulfonimide) (5.0 g, 14.0 mmol) in
THF (20 mL) was added in one portion. The reaction mixture was allowed
to warm up to room temperature over 3 h during which a color change
from yellow to dark brown was observed. The reaction mixture was then
diluted with n-heptane (300 mL) and washed with HCl
(3 × 200 mL, 1M aq) and brine (200 mL). The organic phase was
separated, dried using a phase separator, and concentrated under reduced
pressure. The residues were purified by flash chromatography (12.5%

2,5-Diphenyl-1,3a,4,6a-tetrahydropentalene
(rac-3b)
To a stirred clear
yellow solution of PEPPSI–IPr (196 mg, 0.29 mmol) and LiBr
(1.95 g, 22.48 mmol) in THF (80 mL) was added a 77:23 mixture of 5 and 6 (2.26 g, 5.620 mmol) in THF (35 mL) in
one portion. PhMgBr (7.5 mL, 3M in THF, 22.48 mmol) was then added
dropwise over 5 min. A color change from orange to red was observed.
After 30 min, TLC analysis showed a complete consumption of starting
materials and the reaction was quenched with NH4Cl (180
mL, aq sat.). The resulting mixture was extracted with diethyl ether
(3 × 120 mL). The combined organic layers were washed with H2O (120 mL) and brine (120 mL), dried over phase separator,
concentrated under reduced pressure, and then filtered through silica.

(3aS,6aS)-2,5-Diphenyl-1,3a,4,6a-tetrahydropentalene ((S,S)-3b)
To a dark red solution
of (S,S)-10 (0.40 g,
0.46 mmol) in MeCN (10 mL) was added 1,5-cyclooctadiene (0.10 g, 0.91
mmol) in one portion. The solution was stirred overnight resulting
in an orange solution. The reaction mixture was added directly to
a silica-gel column and eluted with 0–3% EtOAc/heptane. The
product containing fractions were pooled and concentrated under reduced
pressure to give (S,S)-3b as colorless microcrystalline needles (82.0 mg, 70%).
Optical rotation: [α]D24: +54 (c = 0.5, CH2Cl2); mp: 136.8–137.8

Chloro((S,S)-9b)rhodium(I) Dimer ((S,S)-9b)
To chlorobis(ethylene)rhodium
dimer (55 mg, 0.14
mmol) was added a solution of (S,S)-3b (73 mg, 0.28 mmol) in CH2Cl2 (10 mL). The resulting mixture was stirred for 24 h, then filtered
through celite, and concentrated under reduced pressure. Washing the
resulting amorphous solid with n-hexane, followed
by concentration under reduced pressure afforded (S,S)-9b as a red powder (83.4 mg, 75%).
Optical rotation: [α]D24: +1363 (c = 0.5, CH2Cl2).

General Procedure
for Catalytic 1,4-Addition of Boronic Acid
Derivatives to Cyclohexanone
A septum-capped vial, equipped
with a magnetic stirring bar, was charged with the indicated amount
of base and boronic acid derivative. The vial was transferred to a
glovebox, charged with catalyst (2 mol %) and sealed. Degassed organic
solvent and protic co-solvent (10% (v/v)) were consecutively added,
followed by the enone. The reaction mixture was then stirred under
heating (50 °C) until completion (TLC analysis). Filtration through
a short pad of silica/MgSO4, followed by concentration
under reduced pressure and purification by silica-gel chromatography
(EtOAc/heptane) afforded analytically pure ketones 11a–d.

a For a steric quadrant model of chiral
induction, see: ref (1a).

b The corresponding 2,5-di(para-fluorophenyl) and 2,5-di(para-methoxyphenyl)
ligands
could be similarly prepared in 40 and 57% yield as a mixture of C2 and Cs isomers. See Supporting Information for details.

c Single crystals of rac-3b were grown
from a mixture of CH2Cl2, n-hexane, and MeCN. scXRD data obtained
from this material revealed an interesting form of local disorder.
In the structure (solved in R-3), the C1–C2,
C2–C3, C4–C5, and C5–C6 bonds were of essentially
equal length (∼1.4Å), which suggests that the two enantiomeric
forms occupy equivalent positions in the lattice. A more detailed
treatment of this material will be reported elsewhere. For a scXRD
structure of enantiomerically pure 3b, see ref (19).

d Complexation of this material to rhodium
gave 9b with an [α]D25 =
9.6 compared to [α]D25 = 1363.4 for material
obtained through the COD-release pathway.

e Compound 6 could be removed
by repeated chromatography.

f The same procedure was used to synthesize
(S,S)-9a. In this case,
the complexation was performed from the mixture of (S,S)-3a, 1,2-diphenyl ethane, and 7 obtained from HPLC resolution. Recrystallization from a
mixture of chloroform and diethyl ether gave single crystals of (S,S)-9a.
