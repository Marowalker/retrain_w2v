Predicting
the bioactivity of peptides is an important challenge
in drug development and peptide research. In this study, numerical
descriptive vectors (NDVs) for peptide sequences were calculated based
on the physicochemical properties of amino acids (AAs) and principal
component analysis (PCA). The resulted NDV had the same length as
the peptide sequence, so that each entry of NDV corresponded to one
AA in the sequence. They were then applied to quantitative structure–activity
relationship (QSAR) analysis of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)
inhibitor dipeptides, bitter-tasting dipeptides, and nonameric binding
peptides of the human leukocyte antigens (HLA-A*0201). Multiple linear
regression was used to construct the QSAR models. For each peptide
set, a proper subset of physicochemical properties was chosen by the
ant colony optimization algorithm. The leave-one-out cross-validation
(qloo2) values were 0.855, 0.936, and 0.642 and the root-mean-square
errors (RMSEs) were 0.450, 0.149, and 0.461. Our results revealed
that the new numerical descriptive vector can afford extensive characterization
of peptide sequence so that it can be easily employed in peptide QSAR
studies. Moreover, the proposed numerical descriptive vectors were
able to determine hot spot residues in the peptides under study.

Introduction
Peptides
play crucial roles in biological systems and are therefore
recognized as an important target group for pharmaceutical, nutritional,
and cosmetic applications.1 As a result,
thousands of peptides are designed, synthesized, and screened for
different pharmacological systems. In this regard, design and prediction
of bioactivities of peptides remain one of the most challenging areas
in the life science because it is impossible to test all of the peptides
to find the most bioactive among them when considering a large number
of theoretical possible peptides.2 Bioinformatic
studies have become more and more popular in peptide’s design,
particularly the quantitative structure–activity relationship
(QSAR) study. QSAR models utilize a mathematical function to summarize
the relationship between biological activities of a set of compounds
and their structural characteristics.3−6 So far, QSAR models have been successfully
established for angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory peptides,7 antioxidant peptides,8 antimicrobial peptides,9 bitter peptides,10 antitumor peptides,11 etc.12−16 To develop a QSAR model, a set of numerical descriptors is generated
to characterize the structure of interest, e.g., amino acids, which
serves as independent variables, while the biological activities are
the dependent variables. Since the activities of peptides are determined
by the amino acid compositions, sequences, and structures, a proper
encoding technique should be employed for representing the sequence
of amino acids.

Several encoding approaches have been proposed
for representing
the sequence of amino acids. Some of them are based on the amino acid
sequence. For example, in orthonormal encoding,17 each amino acid of the sequence is represented by a 20
bit vector having all entries equal to zero except for that corresponding
to the considered amino acid which is set to one. Consequently, a
peptide sequence with M amino acids is represented by the concatenation
of M × 20 features. The 2 g representation is
another example.18 In this approach, a
peptide is represented by a set of 202 pairs of values
of νi and ci, in which νi is a couple of amino
acids and ci is the counts of the appearance
of that couple in the sequence. The other encoding approaches are
calculated from the physicochemical information. For this category,
a set of descriptors is calculated for each amino acid and they are
concatenated to produce a descriptor data matrix for a set of peptides.
An example is weighted physicochemical encoding: in this method, instead
of considering the composition of the sequence in its natural order,
it is represented by concatenating alphabetically features of amino
acids that have been weighted according to the frequency of amino
acids in the sequence. Therefore, the resulted numerical vector is
composed by 20 × F features.19 Hemmateenejad et al. used quantum topological molecular
similarity parameters of each amino acid instead of their physicochemical
properties.20 In most of the amino acid
indices defined so far, there is more than one feature for each amino
acid in the resulting numerical descriptor vector and, consequently,
the length of the obtained numerical descriptor vector is much longer
than the length of the sequence. In this specific situation, the introduction
of a new peptide representation that can be utilized in QSAR studies
is the frontier of the peptide research.

Recently, we introduced
a new numerical descriptive vector for
proteins and applied it to reveal the similarities between proteins.
This numerical descriptive vector had the same length as the original
sequence. It was calculated based on the physicochemical properties
and principal component analysis. We suggested here the applicability
of our numerical descriptive vector (NDV) for peptide representation
and its usefulness in peptide QSAR research.

Results and Discussion
Five hundred fifty-three physicochemical properties of AAs were
extracted from the AAindex1 database. For a given peptide sequence,
a numerical descriptive vector with the same size of the sequence
length is calculated based on a set of physicochemical properties
of AAs and PCA.21 For example, if a data
set containing n hexapeptides was considered, a descriptor
data matrix with the number of rows and columns of n and 6, respectively, would be obtained (Figure 1). The values of the numerical descriptive
vector are dependent on the types of the AA indices used in the computation
step. Since the number of AA indices provided in the AAindex1 database
was large, it was necessary to employ a variable selection method
such as the Memorized_ACO algorithm for selecting the most convenient
subset of AA indices in a specified data set.

QSAR Models of ACE Inhibitors
ACE data set is composed
of 55 tripeptides as inhibitors of the angiotensin-converting enzyme
(ACE), among which 45 molecules were selected as a training set and
the remainders were used as an external test set to validate the constructed
QSAR model (Table 1).

Several subsets
of AA indices with the different sizes were selected
by the Memorized_ACO algorithm. For each chosen subset, a specific
descriptor data matrix was calculated and used in the QSAR model development.
The resulting models based on the use of different subsets of AA indices
are summarized in Table 2. The ability of the NDV to represent the peptide sequences can be
judged from Table 2. The QSAR model based on the NDM computed using only two AA indices
had correlation coefficients of 0.83 and 0.80 for the training and
test sets, respectively. However, the quality of the QSAR model was
improved by considering more AA indices up to seven. Consequently,
seven physicochemical properties of AA were used in the construction
of the final QSAR model. A list of these AA indices is given in Table S1 (Supporting Information). The calculated
NDM for ACE data set together with the experimental and predicted
biological activities is also presented in Table S2.

The
plot of the predicted activities against the experimental activities for both training and test
sets, for the ACE inhibitor tripeptides, is shown in Figure 2. The squared correlation coefficient
for the training set was calculated as 0.86. With the purpose of confirming
the reliability of the model, leave-one-out and leave-m-out (for example, leave-5-out) cross validation was applied on the
training set and the corresponding qloo2 and qlmo2 of 0.831 and 0.830 were obtained. The closeness of these statistical
parameters to each other and to that of Rtraining2 confirms
that the constructed model is stable. The R2 value for the test set (Rtest2 = 0.859) was also very close to those
for training and cross validation, which revealed the good prediction
power of the QSAR model without the presence of significant overfitting.
In addition, the model possessed a very low value of the chance correlation
of RMP2 (Table 2),
highlighting that the model was not chancy and the resulted relationship
was systematic. Table 3 summarizes the consequences of different past QSAR models of the
ACE peptides alongside those obtained in this investigation. Clearly,
the QSAR model derived in this work for the ACE data set has better
quality in regard to all previous models. The results of cross validation
also approve the efficiency of the model in comparison to the previous
works.

One
key ergonomic advantage of our QSAR model is its easy understanding
and interpretation. To determine the position of the anchor residues
in the peptides binding to ACE, it is enough to check which ones of
residues are significant in the QSAR model. Moreover, the quantitative
contributions for each position reveal, directly, the importance of
these positions.

Table 4 summarizes
the statistical analysis of the selected QSAR model for ACE peptide
inhibitors. It is clear from Table 4 that the regression coefficient associated with the
second AA in the peptide sequence is not significant. The following
equation shows the final QSAR model after removing the nonsignificant
term for the ACE inhibitor tripeptides 1  It means that the anchor positions for ACE
peptide inhibitors are the first and third positions. In other words,
the amino acids located at the two ends of the considered tripeptides
would have more impact on the ACE inhibition. This is in accordance
with the previous studies.20,30 It is also possible
to check if there is a peptide having activity more than the most
bioactive peptide in the ACE data set. The most activity value was
measured for the following sequence: “PPG”. By changing
the type of AA at each position of the peptide sequence, we found
that the most bioactive peptide was that previously recognized (i.e.,
PPG). Preferred amino acids at each position were recognized, as well.
The preferred amino acids at position 1 were found to be Pro, Trp,
and Tyr and for the third position to be just Gly.

QSAR Study on Bitter Peptide
Bitter
sensitivity, as
one of the gustatory sensitivities, shields humans and organisms from
damage by toxic substances. Studies demonstrate that the conduction
of taste signal in taste receptor cells includes a series of complicated
processes intervened by G protein-coupled receptors.31 Bitter-tasting thresholds (BTTs) of 48 dipeptides and their
activities as the negative logarithm of concentration (pT) were chosen
by Collantes et al.24 This data set is
frequently utilized to approve the efficiency of amino acid descriptors.
Forty samples out of 48 dipeptides were treated as the training set
that was used to construct the QSAR model, and the remaining were
regarded as the test set.

Statistical parameters of QSAR models
constructed with different subsets of AA indices are given in Table 5. The results showed
the proficiency of NDV in QSAR modeling of the peptide sequences.
As can be seen in Table 5, even with two AA indices, the obtained QSAR model had good quality.
However, the best QSAR model was constructed using eight AA indices
(Table 5). These AA
indices are listed in Table S3. The resulted
NDM for BTT is given in Table S4. The resulted
multiple linear regression (MLR) model was 2  As shown in eq 2, the best QSAR model yielded
a squared correlation
coefficient (R2) of 0.936 and a root-mean-square
error (RMSE) of 0.149 for the training set. The squared correlation
coefficient calculated via leave-one-out cross validation (q2) was found to be 0.926. Further validation
of the model was carried out on the basis of the external test set,
and a good result was obtained (Rtest2 = 0.907, RMSE = 0.283). The
experimental and predicted biological activities for the BTT data
set are given in Table S4. The relationship
between predicted and experimental activities is shown in Figure 3. The NDV-QSAR model
developed in this study for the BTT data set is compared with the
previously reported QSAR models in Table 6. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) of the final
QSAR models showed that both amino acids in the peptide sequence have
a significant impact on the BTT peptide set (Table S5).

QSAR Model for the HLA
Data Set
This data set comprises
of 177 nonameric binding peptides of the HLA-A*0201. Each peptide
has nine residues. Several QSAR models using different subsets of
AA indices were built, and the results are summarized in Table S6. The best NDV-QSAR model was obtained
using six AA indices. In total, 54.0% of variance in the dependent
variable was explained by this selected model, while 40.7 and 46.1%
of variances were reproduced in leave-one-out and leave-five-out cross
validations, respectively. Although the quality of this model is not
as good as those obtained for two later data sets, it is still comparable
to those reported previously for the HLA data set (row 6 in Table 7). The presence of
outliers was checked using the Williams plot. This plot utilizes simultaneously
the concepts of standardized residual and leverage to show visually
the applicability domain of the model.6Figure 4 depicts
the Williams plot for the HLA data set, indicating that there are
several outliers. To obtain a stable QSAR model, these outliers were
removed and the MLR model was reconstructed and rechecked for the
presence of outliers. Eleven peptides from the training set and three
peptides from the test set were found to be outliers. The resulted
QSAR model after removing the detected outliers had better quality
compared to that of the original model. Features of this model are
given in row 7 of Table 7. The obtained QSAR model had better prediction ability in comparison
to those in all of the previous reports. The root-mean-squared errors
for the training and test sets (RSMEtraining and RSMEtest) were 0.45 and 0.46, respectively. The RMSE–CV
was calculated as 0.50, which is as good as the RSMEtest. The squared correlation coefficients for the prediction of activities
in the training and test sets were found to be 0.70 and 0.71, respectively.
Statistical parameters of the model are tabulated in Table 8. From the results in Table 8, it was found that
some regression coefficients associated to residuals 1, 5, 6, and
7 were not significant. The calculated t-values for
these coefficients were more than 0.05, and the corresponding p-values for these coefficients were high. Omitting these
nonsignificant variables resulted in a QSAR model with Rtraining2 and Rtest2 of 0.69 and 0.71, respectively. RSMEtraining and RSMEtest were both calculated to be 0.46. Based on these results,
it was found that the final QSAR model could explain the variance
in the training set as well as predict the affinities of the test
set accurately. On the other hand, based on the variables remaining
in the final QSAR model, it could be concluded that the anchor positions
are 2, 3, 4, 8, and 9. The final QSAR model for the HLA data set was
as follows 3  The relationship between predicted and experimental
activities is depicted in Figure 5. Searching for AAs for each anchor point to find favored
amino acids at each position led to find sequence “VVPPEEEPV”
with a maximum pBL50 of 7.41. It is worth noting again
that entries of the calculated NDV for each sequence are influential
by the AA appeared at each position, the neighbors of the AA in the
sequence, and the types of AA indices used in the calculation. Consequently,
although positions 1, 5, 6, and 7 were not recognized as the anchor
positions, they could affect the entries of the NDV. However, changing
of AAs at positions 1, 5, 6, and 7 of the best sequence had a small
variation on the binding affinity and the minimum and maximum pBL50 values were found to be 6.96 and 7.41, respectively. It
should be noticed that the most active peptide in the original data
set is “ILDPFPVTV” with a pBL50 of 8.65.
This sequence was detected as outlier and removed before the model
construction. Our model predicted pBL50 of 6.49 for this
sequence. The other most active peptides along with the experimental
and predicted activities are listed in Table 9. To find favored AAs for each position,
a list of suggested peptides by pBL50 values greater than
7.30 was provided by the replacement method (Table 10). Inspection the results of Table 10 indicated that preferred amino
acids at position 1 are valine, leucine, alanine, methionine, and
isoleucine; at position 2 are valine and alanine; at position 3 are
proline and aspartic acid; at position 4 is just proline; at position
5 is just glutamic acid; at positions 6 and 7 are glutamic acid, valine,
leucine, methionine, and isoleucine; at position 8 is just proline;
and at position 9 are valine and alanine.

In the derived model, each anchor position has a regression coefficient
accounting for its contribution to the affinity. Thus, positions 2
and 9 with negative coefficients decrease the affinity because of
their negative contributions and positions 3, 4, and 8 make positive
contributions to the affinity.

Conclusions
A
new numerical descriptive vector was introduced for peptide QSAR
analysis. Physicochemical properties of AAs and principal component
analysis were used in the calculation of NDVs of peptide sequences.
The application of the proposed NDV on three peptide sets showed that
this new peptide descriptor is useful in bioactive peptide QSAR analysis.
The resulted QSAR models not only showed good self-prediction ability
but also exhibited sufficient prediction power for samples in the
test sets. On the other hand, since our proposed numerical descriptive
vector has the same length as the peptide sequence, the interpretation
of the resulted QSAR models is straightforward and it seems that we
can easily use them to have a hot spot analysis for different kinds
of biologically and pharmaceutically peptides. Indeed, the active
parts of the considered peptides correspond to those AAs having statistically
significant regression coefficients in the resulted QSAR model.

Computational
Methods
Data Sets and Descriptors
Three peptide data sets with
known biological activity were used to investigate the performances
of the suggested AA indices. They were as follows: data set 1 contained
a set of 55 angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors; data set
2 contained a set of 12 bactericidal peptides, data set 3 comprised
a set of 177 nonameric peptides binding to the HLA-A*0201 molecule,
and data set 4 contained a set of 48 bitter dipeptides. The data sets
were picked up from the literature.20,26,30,32−34 To ensure a fair comparison, the same training and test sets were
used for each considered data set. Table 1 presents details of all data sets.

Descriptor
Extraction and Model Development
One of
the essential steps in structure–activity relationship studies
is the extraction of some numerical descriptors from the desired compounds
that can be useful in describing the structural properties.

In the current research, for each peptide sequence, a numerical descriptive
vector is calculated based on a set of physicochemical properties
of AAs and PCA.21 Consider a residue with n AAs. For each amino acid in the residue a numerical matrix Xi with a size of N × L is created, where L is
the number of considered physicochemical indices. For a residue of
length N, subsequently, N numerical
matrices are created. The entries of the ith X matrix are calculated by the following equation 4  where ai is a vector
containing the physicochemical properties of the ith AA and dij is 5  Here, the distance between the
two AA in the
residue is calculated as the Euclidean distance. The first eigenvector
of each Xi matrix is computed.
No pretreatment is carried out on the Xi matrix prior to PCA. The resulted eigenvector vectors from
all X matrices are collected in a matrix Y (N × N). The first eigenvector
of the Y matrix is considered as the numerical descriptive
vector of the residue. Figure 1 describes graphically all of the above calculation steps
for a tripeptide “RPG”, as an example. For more information,
the reader should refer to our previous paper.21

The physicochemical properties of AAs were extracted
from the AAindex
database. This database contains various physicochemical and biochemical
properties of amino acids and pairs of amino acids.35,36 The AAindex database is divided into three parts: AAindex1 for the
amino acid indices of 20 numerical values, AAindex2 for amino acid
substitution matrices, and AAindex3 for amino acid contact potential
matrices.37 For the purpose of peptide
descriptor calculation, we considered only the 553 amino acid indices
in AAindex1.

Keeping in the mind that the calculated numerical
descriptive vector
for a peptide sequence is highly dependent on the AA indices used
in the calculation, a proper set of AA indices was chosen by the Memorized_ACO
algorithm38−40 for each data set. The ACO algorithm is inspired
by the behavior of real ants that are able to find the shortest path
from a food to their nest. An ant deposits pheromone while moving.
Ants explore the space randomly, but a route with more pheromone deposited
by previous ants that have already passed is more likely to be chosen
by the future ants. The ACO algorithm is an iterative algorithm. In
this algorithm, equal pheromone values are initially assigned to all
AA indices. As time proceeds, the level of pheromone deposited on
the best AA indices increases, while that for other variables decreases.
The best AA indices are those yielding a highly predictive power QSAR
model. A graphical representation of the process is given in Figure 1. The Memorized_ACO
algorithm employs an external memory in which knowledge incorporated
from the previous ACO iterations is deposited. It fills by running
a simple ACO algorithm several times.

Another advantage of our
proposed method is that modeling of the
relationship between the calculated numerical descriptive vectors
and the biological activities of peptides was simply achieved by utilizing
multiple linear regression (MLR) without requiring variable selection.
Assessment of the importance of each residue, in the peptide sequence,
in the biological activity is carried out by considering the regression
coefficients of the resulted model.

To test the predictive power
of the models, different cross-validation
approaches were applied. The correlation coefficient of the test set
(Rtest2) was also computed. A Y-randomization test was performed
to assess the risk of chance correlation of the model. All necessary
programs were written in MATLAB (MathWorks). The method is available
for the research community.
