In this study, hydroxyl-terminated
polybutadiene–poly(epoxide
ionic liquid)–poly(urethane urea) (HTPB-PEIL-PU) membranes,
HTPB-PEIL1-PU and HTPB-PEIL2-PU, were prepared by the reaction of
functionalized PEIL, poly(1-methylimidazole-3-methyl-ethyloxy)hexafluorophosphate
or poly(1-methylimidazole-3-methyl-ethyloxy)bistrifluoromethanesulfonimidate,
respectively, with HTPB using 4,4′-diphenylmethane diisocyanate
(MDI) as the chain extender. The HTPB-PEIL-PU and HTPB membranes were
investigated for the selective recovery of n-butanol
from aqueous solutions by pervaporation. PEIL was confirmed to be
successfully embedded in the PU membranes by 1H NMR, Fourier
transform infrared, and differential scanning calorimetry measurements.
According to our mechanical measurements, the HTPB-PEIL-PU membranes
retain the mechanical properties of the original PU membrane. PEIL
was shown to enhance the diffusion rate of n-butanol
significantly based on swelling behavior tests. The pervaporation
flux through the HTPB-PEIL1-PU membrane increased with increasing
feed temperature and feed concentration. In contrast, the separation
factor of the HTPB-PEIL1-PU membrane increased with increasing feed
temperature but decreased with increasing feed concentration. In addition,
the HTPB-PEIL2-PU membrane exhibited an optimal separation factor
of up to 29.2 at a feed concentration of 3% and a feed temperature
of 70 °C, which is superior to that (22.7) through pure HTPB
membranes. Furthermore, the HTPB-PEIL1-PU and HTPB-PEIL2-PU membranes
show better long-term stability than other supported ionic liquid
membranes.

==== Body
1 Introduction
n-Butanol is an important fine chemical that is
extensively used in the areas of medicine and chemical engineering,
as well as coating industries. In addition, several large chemical
industry enterprises have been established to commercialize biobutanol.1,2 However, a drawback of commercial biobutanol production is that
the concentration of biobutanol in the fermentation broth is very
low, and this is a bottleneck problem in the separation and purification
process.3 The main methods of dealing with n-butanol from aqueous solutions are distillation, absorption,
gas stripping, and liquid–liquid extraction. Unfortunately,
these methods require significant energy or are complex, which restricts
their broader application.

Pervaporation has gained popularity
in the past few years because
of its superiority in removing trace organics from aqueous solutions.4−7 Compared with other methods of separating organic wastewater, pervaporation
has many advantages such as device simplicity, environmentally friendly
operation, low cost, and low energy consumption.8,9 Many
polymer materials such as polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), zeolite or
silicalite-filled siloxane, polyether block amide, and poly(urethane
urea) (PU) have been shown to have greater affinity for n-butanol than water in pervaporation.10−14

Because of their excellent ability to solubilize
a large range
of organic molecules, as well as their thermal stability, ionic liquids
(ILs) are an important substitute for classical organic solvents.15,16 ILs can be filled into the pores of porous membranes, forming so-called
supported ionic liquid membranes (SILMs). SILMs have several merits;
for example, molecular diffusion is enhanced by the appropriate choice
of IL components and is much higher in ILs than in polymers.17−19 Thus, many studies concerning pervaporation by SILMs have been reported,
particularly because SILMs exhibit high fluxes and excellent separation.
Plaza reported20 sweep gas pervaporation
with gelled SILMs prepared by gelating [bmim][PF6] into
porous polytetrafluoroethylene hollow fibers. Heitmann utilized21 SILMs filled with tetracyanoborate and tris(pentafluoroethyl)trifluorophosphate
ILs for pervaporation. Cascon used22 SILMs
to recover n-butanol from dilute aqueous solutions
by pervaporation, and hydrophobic ammonium- and phosphonium-based
room temperature ILs were used as the liquid fillers in the SILMs.
The abovementioned studies of SILMs for pervaporation all demonstrate
their good pervaporation performance.

However, the ILs in SILMs
are easily and gradually lost with increasing
experimental time.23 Thus, a kind of solidified
poly(epoxide ionic liquid) (PEIL)-based polyurethane membrane has
been designed to improve membrane stability and maintain the good
separation performance of the ionic liquid. To date, this concept
has not been investigated in depth. In this study, these novel PEIL-based
polyurethane membranes were prepared for pervaporation as follows:
(1) first, polyepichlorohydrin (PECH) was produced by the ring opening
polymerization of epichlorohydrin (ECH)24 and was subsequently reacted with n-methylimidazole
and potassium hexafluorophosphate (KPF6) or lithium ditrifluoromethane
sulfonylinimide (LiTf2N), thus yielding PEIL. Thus, hydroxyl
groups on both sides of polymer chains are introduced via these processes.
(2) Second, to obtain the desired structure and good performance of
the polyurethane membrane,25,26 isocyanate was reacted
with the hydroxyl groups of PEIL and 1,4-butanediol (BDO) was used
to extend the chains. In addition, the separation performance and
the stability of PEIL-based polyurethane membranes was measured and
evaluated for the pervaporation of n-butanol/water
solution.

In this paper, we report a new kind of solidified
PEIL-based polyurethane
membrane for pervaporation. This membrane solves several serious defects
of SILMs, such as low load capacity and easy release of ILs, and could
increase the efficiency of the industrial separation of n-butanol.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 1H NMR Analysis
The 1H NMR spectra of PECH,
PEIL1, and PEIL2 in Figure 1 confirm the presence of the
introduced H-containing groups. As shown in Figure 1, the signals for protons at 3.36 and 2.50
ppm are the absorption peaks of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). The 1H NMR spectra show that the peaks at 8.95, 7.70, and 7.60
ppm emerge, as shown in Figure 1b,c. These peaks are attributed to the protons of n-methylimidazole introduced into PECH through the quaternization
reaction. The strong resonance absorption peaks at 3.65 ppm in Figure 1a are assigned to
−CH2Cl, but the corresponding peaks are weakened
in the spectra as shown in Figure 1b,c because −Cl has been replaced by an imidazole
ring. The spectra in Figure 1b,c are similar because of similar frameworks. The above data
confirm that n-methylimidazole had been grafted onto
the PECH chain successfully.

Figure 1 1H NMR spectra of (a) PECH, (b) PEIL1,
and (c) PEIL2.

2.2 FTIR
Analysis
Figure 2 shows the Fourier transform infrared (FTIR)
spectra of PECH, PEIL1, and PEIL2. For PECH, the strong absorption
peak at 1128 cm–1 is attributed to the C–O–C
stretching vibration. The absorption peaks observed at 2875 and 748
cm–1 are assigned to the −CH2–
and the C–Cl group stretching vibrations, respectively. An
intense −OH vibration is observed at 3475 cm–1. For PEIL1, the C–Cl absorption peak is weakened and replaced
by those corresponding to the vibrations of the imidazole ring at
1570 and 1450 cm–1, which indicates that the quaternization
reaction was successful. The absorption peak at 836 cm–1 is assigned to the P–F stretching vibration. For PEIL2, peaks
at 1195 and 1350 cm–1 correspond to the C–F
symmetric and asymmetric stretching vibrations, respectively. These
findings are consistent with the 1H NMR results.

Figure 2 FTIR spectra
of PECH, PEIL1, and PEIL2.

Figure 3 shows
the
FTIR spectra of the hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene (HTPB)-PU, HTPB-PEIL1-PU,
and HTPB-PEIL2-PU membranes. In Figure 3, the absorption peaks at 1705 and 1531 cm–1 are attributed to C=O and N–C stretching vibrations,
respectively, which proves the formation of the urethane group (−NHCOO−).
However, in the spectrum of the HTPB-PEIL1-PU membrane, a strong P–F
stretching vibration at 840 cm–1 appears because
of the successful introduction of PEIL1 into HTPB-PU. Meanwhile, peaks
at 1203 and 1353 cm–1 corresponding to the C–F
symmetric and asymmetric stretches, respectively, are observed in
the spectrum of the HTPB-PEIL2-PU membrane, which confirms that PEIL2
molecules are cross-linked with HTPB and 4,4′-diphenylmethane
diisocyanate (MDI).

membranes.

2.3 Differential
Scanning Calorimetry Analysis
Table 1 lists the
glass transition temperature (Tg) of different
samples. The Tg values of PEIL1 and PEIL2
are 63.54 and −8.56 °C, respectively, so they are solid
and liquid at room temperature, respectively. A Tg value could not be obtained for HTPB-PU because the
heating range used was −50 to 150 °C, whereas the theoretical Tg value of HTPB-PU is around −75 °C.27 However, new Tg values
were observed for both the HTPB-PEIL1-PU membrane (48.96 °C)
and HTPB-PEIL2-PU membrane (−15.29 °C) after PEIL1 and
PEIL2 had been introduced into the HTPB-PU membrane. These Tg values are both lower than the Tg value of primary PEIL. The above changes in the Tg values may be attributed to microphase separation.
When the hard segments of PEIL are connected with the soft segments
of HTPB by MDI the membrane has poor compatibility, which results
in the new Tg values of the HTPB-PEIL-PU
membranes.

2.4 Mechanical Properties
Tensile testing
was performed on the HTPB-PU, HTPB-PEIL1-PU, and HTPB-PEIL2-PU membranes,
and the analytical results are shown in Figure 4 and Table 2. The tensile strength of HTPB-PEIL2-PU is almost the
same as that of the initial PU membrane, whereas that of HTPB-PEIL1-PU
dropped by just 13.7%. Compared with the elongation at the break of
HTPB-PU (1688.5%), that of HTPB-PEIL1-PU dropped to 1307.8%, whereas
that of HTPB-PEIL2-PU increased to 1557.8%. The above phenomenon is
due to the addition of the crisper PEIL. The modified HTPB-PU maintained
its excellent mechanical properties in the solid PU membranes; thus,
the new material could be used for the subsequent pervaporation experiments.

2.5 Swelling Properties of the Membranes and Diffusion
Coefficients
Figure 5 shows the different swelling behaviors of the membranes in
pure n-butanol and water. The degrees of equilibrium
swelling in pure n-butanol are 14.33, 12.57, and
11.43% for the HTPB-PU, HTPB-PEIL1-PU, and HTPB-PEIL2-PU membranes,
respectively. The equilibrium swelling times for the HTPB-PEIL1-PU
and HTPB-PEIL2-PU membranes in pure n-butanol are
almost two times lower than that of the original HTPB-PU membrane.
However, the above membranes seem not to swell in water, which indicates
that the membranes are suitable for the separation of n-butanol from water.

Figure 5 Swelling behavior of HTPB-PU, HTPB-PEIL1-PU, and HTPB-PEIL2-PU
membranes in n-butanol and water.

The diffusion coefficient for Fickian diffusion
can be obtained
using eq 1.28 1  where We and Wt are the sorption
mass at
equilibrium and at time t, respectively, and l is the thickness of the dried membrane. The application
of eq 1 requires the
following conditions: (a) steady-state operation; (b) minimal external
mass and heat-transfer resistance (by achieving a sufficiently high
flow rate on both sides of the membrane); thus, only intraparticle
diffusion is considered; and (c) the reactor external wall is adiabatic.

Equation 1 can be
simplified into eq 2 by
truncation at the first term in the summation. 2  

According to the
hypothesis that the diffusion coefficient is constant, eq 2 can be rewritten as eq 3. 3  

The graph of ln(1 – Wt/We) as a function of t/l2 is a straight line within the normal
limits of experimental error. Therefore, the diffusion coefficient
can be acquired from the slope of the straight line. The linear relationship
of ln(1 – Wt/We) versus t/l2 for n-butanol through different membranes
is shown in Figure 6.

Figure 6 Relationship of ln(1 – Wt/We) vs t/l2 for n-butanol through different membranes.

The diffusion coefficients for n-butanol through
different membrane samples were calculated according to the slopes
of different lines in Figure 6 and are listed in Table 3. It was found that the diffusion coefficient through
the HTPB-PEIL1-PU membrane is more than double that through the initial
membrane. In addition, the HTPB-PEIL2-PU membrane exhibits the highest
diffusion coefficient (2.475 × 10–11 m2·s–1) of the three membranes. Thus,
the introduction of PEIL, especially PEIL2, can significantly enhance
the diffusion rate of n-butanol.

2.6 Pervaporation Experiment Results
Figure 7 shows the
effects of the feed concentration and feed temperature on the permeation
flux of the HTPB-PEIL1-PU membrane at a fixed downstream pressure
of 1000 Pa. It was observed that the permeation flux of the HTPB-PEIL1-PU
membrane significantly increased with increasing feed temperature.
The permeating molecules diffuse through the free volume of the membrane
in the pervaporation process. Free volume is randomly produced in
amorphous regions by the thermal motion of the polymer chains. The
amplitude and frequency of polymer chain jumping increase with increasing
feed temperature, resulting in larger free volumes in the membrane.
At the same time, the mobility of the permeating molecules is improved.
Therefore, the diffusion rate of each permeating molecule increases
with increasing feed temperature, which leads to higher flux.

Figure 7 Effects of
feed concentrations and temperature on the flux of the
HTPB-PEIL1-PU membrane under the fixed downstream pressure of 1000
Pa.

Meanwhile, the pervaporation flux
at feed concentrations of 5%
through the membranes is much higher than that at feed concentrations
of 3 and 1%. The relationship between the concentrations in the two
phases (vapor–liquid) with permeation flux is shown in eq 4 for the recovery of volatile
organic compounds (VOCs) from aqueous solution. 4  where Ki (m s–1), ρ (mol m–3), (Ci)L (dimensionless),
and (Ci)V (dimensionless)
denote the coefficient of total mass transfer rate, feed total molar
density, concentration of bulk liquid phase (mole fraction), and concentration
of bulk vapor phase (mole fraction), respectively, for component i. (Ci)L is dominant because it is much larger than (Ci)V. As a result, increasing
the feed concentration will lead to enhanced permeation flux. The
above effects of feed temperature and feed concentration on the pervaporation
performance in Figure 7 are similar to those reported by Dong and Choudhari.29,30

Figure 8 shows
the
effects of the feed concentration and temperature on the separation
factor of the HTPB-PEIL1-PU membrane at a fixed downstream pressure
of 1000 Pa. The separation factor of the HTPB-PEIL1-PU membrane increased
with increasing temperature. This is attributed to the increase in
the amplitude and frequency of the polymer chain jumping with increasing
feed temperature, which results in the fluxes of n-butanol and water increasing simultaneously. However, for PU membranes,
the selectivity for n-butanol is greater than that
for water. This can be explained by the Arrhenius equation, as eq 5. 5  where EJ is the
activation energy, Ji is the solute flux, and Ji,0 and R are both constants.

Figure 8 Effects of feed concentrations
and temperature on the separation
factor of the HTPB-PEIL1-PU membrane under the fixed downstream pressure
of 1000 Pa.

Figure 9 shows Arrhenius
plots of ln J versus 1/T for the
HTPB-PU, HTPB-PEIL1-PU, and HTPB-PEIL2-PU membranes at a fixed concentration
of 3% and a downstream pressure of 1000 Pa. According to the slopes
of the Arrhenius plots, the permeation activation energies of n-butanol through the HTPB-PU, HTPB-PEIL1-PU, and HTPB-PEIL2-PU
membranes are 58.68, 60.99, and 62.69 kJ mol–1,
respectively, and those of water are 9.17, 18.21, and 19.44 kJ mol–1, respectively. The larger permeation activation energy
of n-butanol than that of water reveals that the n-butanol permeation flux is more sensitive to increasing
temperature than the water permeation flux.

Figure 9 Arrhenius plots of HTPB-PU,
HTPB-PEIL1-PU, and HTPB-PEIL2-PU membranes
at fixed concentration of 3% and under downstream pressure of 1000
Pa.

The separation factor at feed
concentrations of 1 and 3% through
the membranes is much higher than that in feed concentrations of 5%.
HTPB-PEIL1-PU has a strong affinity for n-butanol,
so the n-butanol flux increases with increasing feed
concentration. Nevertheless, because there is a coupling effect between
water and n-butanol during pervaporation and water
molecules penetrate the membranes along with n-butanol,
there is a reduction in the separation factor.

However, the
separation factors at feed concentrations of 1 and
3% are similar. Combining the excellent permeation flux results shown
before, 3% was chosen as the optimal feed concentration for our subsequent
experiments.

Figure 10 compares
the flux and separation factors of HTPB-PU, HTPB-PEIL1-PU, and HTPB-PEIL2-PU
membranes at a fixed concentration of 3% and downstream pressure of
1000 Pa. It is demonstrated that the separation factors of the three
membranes under the same pervaporation conditions can be ranked in
the following order: HTPB-PEIL2-PU > HTPB-PEIL1-PU > HTPB-PU.
The
introduction of the ionic liquid into the HTPB-PEIL2-PU membranes
makes it more hydrophobic than the HTPB-PU membrane itself. As n-butanol and water molecules pass the membrane, a large
number of water molecules are blocked by the membrane. In addition,
as demonstrated in Figure 5, the diffusion rate of n-butanol molecules
is much faster through the modified membranes than that through the
initial HTPB-PU membrane. As shown in Figure 10, HTPB-PEIL2-PU shows better separation
performance than HTPB-PEIL1-PU because of the stronger hydrophobicity
of the Tf2N– groups in the former compared
with the PF6– groups in the latter. Izak
reported that the diffusion coefficients of n-butanol
in 1-ethenyl-3-ethyl-imidazolium hexafluorophosphate-PDMS exceed those
in PDMS alone.31 The enrichment factors
and superior permeation flux of n-butanol in IL-PDMS
result from the higher diffusion coefficient. Uragami reported32 that when aqueous solutions of 0.05 wt % VOCs
permeated through poly(styrene)-b-poly(dimethylsiloxane)
(PSt-b-PDMS) membranes containing 1-allyl-3-butylimidazoliumbis(trifluoromethane
sulfonyl)imide ([ABIM]TFSI) ionic liquid ([ABIM]TFSI/PSt-b-PDMS), the prepared membranes had strong VOC/water selectivity.
The separation performance of the [ABIM]TFSI/PSt-b-PDMS membranes was enhanced by increasing the [ABIM]TFSI content.
All the above results indicate that the introduction of a hydrophobic
ionic liquid is very helpful for the absorption of organic compounds.

Figure 10 Effects
of feed temperature on flux and separation factor through
HTPB-PU, HTPB-PEIL1-PU, and HTPB-PEIL2-PU membranes at fixed concentration
of 3% and downstream pressure of 1000 Pa.

On the other hand, the permeation fluxes through the three
membranes
show the opposite trend to that of the separation factor. It is obvious
that PEIL has a strong affinity for n-butanol but
is incompatible with water; thus, the total fluxes of the n-butanol aqueous solution at low feed concentrations through
the HTPB-PEIL2-PU and HTPB-PEIL1-PU membranes are lower than that
through the HTPB-PU membrane.

2.7 Membrane
Stability
Figure 11 shows the pervaporation results
for the HTPB-PEIL1-PU and HTPB-PEIL2-PU membranes after two weeks’
storage. Over the two week period, the used film was soaked in distilled
water in a beaker, sealed with a plastic wrap, and kept at room temperature.
The flux and separation factors at this time were maintained at almost
the same values as those of the original membranes. Thus, the long-term
stabilities of the HTPB-PEIL1-PU and HTPB-PEIL2-PU membranes were
better than those of previously reported supported IL membranes, which
may result from the strong interactions between the PEIL moiety and
PU membrane because of covalent bonding.

and HTPB-PEIL2-PU membranes after two
weeks.

3 Conclusions
In this study, HTPB-PEIL-PU membranes were prepared by the reaction
of PEIL1 or PEIL2 with HTPB and MDI to improve the membrane stability
and maintain good separation performance of the ionic liquid. The
pervaporation recovery of n-butanol from aqueous
solutions was investigated thoroughly. The results indicate that the
permeation flux through the HTPB-PEIL1-PU membranes increases as the
feed temperature and feed concentration increase. The separation factor
of the HTPB-PEIL1-PU membranes increases with increasing feed temperature
but decreases with increasing feed concentration. In addition, HTPB-PEIL2-PU
exhibits an optimal separation factor of up to 29.2 at a feed concentration
of 3% and a temperature of 70 °C compared to that of 22.7 through
the pure HTPB membrane. Furthermore, it was found that the HTPB-PEIL1-PU
and HTPB-PEIL2-PU membranes show better long-term stability than those
of SILMs. Possibly, the solidified PEIL-based polyurethane membranes
with good total flux and high n-butanol/H2O selectivity may be an attractive alternative or supplement to conventional
polymeric membranes and SILMs for the separation of n-butanol from water.

The selection and pairing of the types
of anions and cations in
ILs is one of the important factors affecting pervaporation performance;
thus, a systematic study of the HTPB-PEIL-PU membranes with various
types of IL anions and cations is required.

purchased from Shanghai Aladdin Co., Ltd., China. ECH, BDO, ethylenediaminetetraacetic
acid disodium salt (EDTA-2Na), 1,2-dichloroethane, and methanol were
procured from Shanghai Lingfeng Co., Ltd., China. The abovementioned
reagents were of analytical grade and employed without further purification.
Hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene (HTPB, hydroxyl value = 0.68 mmol
KOH g–1) with a molecular weight of 2950 (Mn) was supplied by Shandong Zibo Qilong Co.,
Ltd., China. 1-Methyl-2-pyrrolidinone (NMP) and tetrahydrofuran (THF)
solvents were supplied by Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd., China,
dried with molecular sieves and distilled under nitrogen. Deionized
water was used directly throughout the study.

4.2 Preparation
of PEIL
4.2.1 Synthesis of PECH
PECH was prepared
by the ring opening polymerization of ECH as follows. First, 1.8 g
BDO, 25 mL 1,2-dichloroethane, 0.234 mL SnCl4, and 0.613
mL CF3COOH as a co-catalyst were added to a flask. Secondly,
121.2 g ECH was added dropwise to the flask with stirring at 0–5
°C for 1 h. Afterward, the solution was kept stirring at 65–70
°C for another 2 h. Then, the reaction mixture was returned to
room temperature, and 70 g of aqueous 10% methanol solution containing
0.8 g EDTA-2Na was added to terminate the reaction. The organic phase
was extracted twice with 70 g of aqueous 10% methanol solution and
concentrated by rotary evaporation under reduced pressure at 70 °C.
The remaining viscous solution was dried for 24 h under vacuum at
90 °C. The synthetic process is shown in Scheme 1.

4.2.2 Synthesis of PEIL
Poly(1-methylimidazole-3-methyl-ethyloxy)chloride
ionic liquid (P[MIEO][Cl]) was prepared by the reaction of PECH and n-methylimidazole in a Cl:n-methylimidazole
molar ratio of 2:3 in nitrogen for 24 h at 100 °C.

Then,
KPF6 or LiTf2N was added to the P[MIEO][Cl]
aqueous solution in a PF6–(or Tf2N–):Cl– molar ratio of
1.2:1 with mechanical stirring for 2 h. The water-insoluble solid
of poly(1-methylimidazole-3-methyl-ethyloxy)hexafluorophosphate ionic
liquid (P[MIEO][PF6], PEIL1) or poly(1-methylimidazole-3-methyl-ethyloxy)bistrifluoromethanesulfonimidate
ionic liquid (P[MIEO][Tf2N], PEIL2) was filtered out of
aqueous solution after ion exchange. The filtered precipitates were
rinsed several times with deionized water until the concentration
of chlorine ions in the filtrate was below 5 mg L–1. The products were dried under vacuum at 60 °C for 24 h in
an oven. The synthetic process is also shown in Scheme 1.

4.3 Preparation
of the HTPB-PEIL-PU Membrane
Prepolyurethane was synthesized
by an −NCO-terminated reaction
of HTPB, PEIL1 (or PEIL2), and MDI with an −OH:–NCO
molar ratio of 1:2 at 80 °C for 1 h under nitrogen. BDO dissolved
in NMP (or THF) was added to the prepolyurethane in an −OH:–NH2 molar ratio of 1 for chain extension at 40 °C for 30
min, and the solvent content was kept at 70 wt %. Thus, the HTPB-PEIL-PU
casting solution was obtained.

Then, the above casting solution
was coated on glass plates after vacuum degassing and then exposed
to air for cross-linking. Finally, the prepared membranes were put
in an oven under vacuum and step-heated at 50 and 70 °C for 6
and 24 h, respectively. The thickness of the HTPB-PEIL-PU membrane
was about 120 μm in this study. The preparation process is shown
in Scheme 2.

was used for the evaluation of the thermal stability of the PECH,
PEIL1, PEIL2, and HTPB-PU membranes, HTPB-PEIL1-PU membrane, and HTPB-PEIL2-PU
membrane under an N2 atmosphere at a heating rate of 20
°C min–1 from −50 to 150 °C.

The tensile strength and elongation at break values of the membranes
were measured at room temperature using a universal mechanical testing
instrument (Instron 4465, USA) at a strain rate of 500 mm min–1. For each membrane, at least three specimen tests
were carried out.

4.5 Membrane Swelling
The dried HTPB-PU,
HTPB-PEIL1-PU, and HTPB-PEIL2-PU membranes were soaked in n-butanol or deionized water separately at 25 °C for
a certain time. Then, they were removed from the solution, and the
excess solvent on the membrane was removed promptly with tissue paper.
The increase in the weight of the swelled membrane was then measured
using a digital analytical balance. The degree of membrane swelling
is given by eq 6. 6  where Wd denotes
the weight of the dry membrane, WS denotes
the weight of the swollen membrane, and DS denotes the degree of membrane
swelling.

4.6 Pervaporation Tests
The feed solutions
for the tests were binary n-butanol–water
solutions. The tests were carried out using a continuous setup reported
by Li,33 as shown in Figure 12. The circular flat membranes
were fixed on a porous sintered metal holder in a hermetic stainless-steel
membrane cell possessing an effective membrane area of about 60.8
cm2. The flow rate of the feed solutions was controlled
by a rotameter, and the feed temperature of the solutions was controlled
by a thermostat. The temperature fluctuated by ±0.5 °C because
the feed solutions were heated to the bubble point temperature, and
the solutions vaporize rapidly in the endothermic process, leading
to a decrease in the membrane temperature. Thus, the downstream pressure
was maintained by a vacuum pump in the range of 666–1334 Pa.
The vapor permeating from the membrane was condensed and collected
by two cold traps after a steady state had been obtained. The freezing
medium of the first cold trap was a refrigerant stream of −9.9
to −5.1 °C and that of the second was liquid nitrogen.

Three test conditions were selected to optimize the working
parameters.
The first set of test conditions had a constant feed concentration
and a downstream pressure of 1000 Pa, but the temperature of the feed
solution was varied between 40 and 70 °C to explore the influence
of feed temperature on mass transfer in the HTPB-PEIL1-PU membranes.
The second set of test conditions had a fixed feed temperature and
a downstream pressure of 1000 Pa, but the feed concentration was varied
between 1 and 5 wt % to evaluate the influence of the feed concentration
on the mass transfer in the HTPB-PEIL1-PU membranes. The third set
of test conditions had a constant feed concentration of 3 wt % and
a downstream pressure of 1000 Pa, but the feed temperature was varied
between 40 and 70 °C to compare the pervaporation performance
of the HTPB-PU, HTPB-PEIL1-PU, and HTPB-PEIL2-PU membranes.

The permeation flux (J) at the steady state depends
on the weight (Mp) of the collected permeate
and is given by eq 7. 7  where Mp denotes
the weight of the collected permeate measured using an electronic
balance (Mettler AT21, P. R. China), A is the effective
membrane surface area and t is the test time interval
for pervaporation.

The selective permeability of the membrane
depends on the separation
factor (α), which is calculated using eq 8. 8  where X denotes the weight
fractions of the species in the feed and Y denotes
the weight fractions of species in the permeate. The subscript “b”
denotes n-butanol and “w” denotes water.

The concentration of the aqueous n-butanol solution
was measured by preparing standard curves of the concentration versus
the density. All measurements were carried out using a densitometer
(Anton Paar DMA 5000, Austria) and measured in triplicate. Average
values are presented.

4.7 Membrane Stability Experiments
After
the pervaporation measurements on the HTPB-PEIL1-PU and HTPB-PEIL2-PU
membranes had been performed, the membranes were immersed in distilled
water. Two weeks later, the separation performance of the above samples
was measured again for comparison.
