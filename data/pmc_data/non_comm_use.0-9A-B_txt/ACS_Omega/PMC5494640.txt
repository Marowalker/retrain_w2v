The utilization of the anodic TiO2 nanotube layers, with uniform Al2O3 coatings of different thicknesses (prepared by atomic
layer deposition, ALD), as the new electrode material for lithium-ion
batteries (LIBs), is reported herein. Electrodes with very thin Al2O3 coatings (∼1 nm) show a superior electrochemical
performance for use in LIBs compared to that of the uncoated TiO2 nanotube layers. A more than 2 times higher areal capacity
is received on these coated TiO2 nanotube layers (∼75
vs 200 μAh/cm2) as well as higher rate capability
and coulombic efficiency of the charging and discharging reactions.
Reasons for this can be attributed to an increased mechanical stability
of the TiO2 nanotube layers upon Al2O3 coating, as well as to an enhanced diffusion of the Li+ ions within the coated nanotube layers. In contrast, thicker ALD
Al2O3 coatings result in a blocking of the electrode
surface and therefore an areal capacity decrease.

==== Body
Introduction
During the last decade,
TiO2 nanomaterials have widely
been studied as an alternative electrode material for lithium-ion
batteries (LIBs).1−15 TiO2 has a higher lithiation potential (∼1.6 V
vs Li/Li+) compared to that of the negative electrodes,
such as graphite (∼0.1 V vs Li/Li+), and therefore
enhances safety of the cells and provides a good capacity retention
on cycling and a low self-discharge.1−4 Furthermore, TiO2 shows low volume
changes of less than 4% upon reversible insertion and extraction of
Li+ in the lattice. However, TiO2 also has a
poor electrical conductivity and shows limited Li+ uptake
and slow Li+ insertion kinetics.1−4 To overcome these drawbacks, nanostructured
TiO2, such as mesoporous microspheres,5 nanowires,6,7 nanoparticles,8 nanoflakes,9 or TiO2 nanotubes,1−4,10 produced via different methods
have been considered as anodes due to the larger specific surface
area. Although most of these structures are randomly oriented and
have to be deposited on the back contact of the electrode, self-organized
TiO2 nanotube layers produced by electrochemical anodization
of the Ti substrates consist of straight and vertically aligned nanotubes
in direct electrical contact with the underlying Ti substrate.16 Another advantage of the vertically aligned
nanotube layers is a direct diffusion path for the Li+ ions,
resulting in a superior electrochemical performance.11

To further increase the capacity and conductivity
of the TiO2 nanotubes for their use in LIBs, they have
been decorated
or coated with other metals and metal oxides, with higher conductivities
and capacities, for example, Ag,17 Cu6Sn5,18 Fe2O3,19 SnO,20 SnO2,21,22 or ZnO.23 Another advantage of these composite structures
is that due to their hollow tubular architecture they can bear volume
variations upon battery cycling without mechanical failure.

Among the various methods that can be used for the coating and
decoration of the TiO2 nanotube layers, atomic layer deposition
(ALD) has been the only method that creates uniform coatings of the
nanotube walls from inside as well as outside, with a precise control
of the coating thickness according to the deposition cycles.24−26 However, although several reports can be found on utilization of
the ALD coatings of different materials to modify the electrodes for
lithium-ion battery application,27−33 only one publication reports on the use of ALD to coat an anode
prepared from an anodic TiO2 nanotube layer with ZnO.23

Usually, passivation layers on the electrode
surfaces (solid electrolyte
interphase (SEI)) are formed via decomposition of the electrolyte
and are necessary to prevent further electrolyte decomposition that
often leads to unsafe operation conditions.34 However, Li+ ions are consumed for SEI formation, reducing
the overall capacity of the electrode. Thin layers of Al2O3 can suppress the SEI formation and undesirable side
reactions. Several reports demonstrated the beneficial effect of the
Al2O3 coatings on electrodes prepared from different
materials for passivation of the electrode surfaces.35−43 At the same time, Al2O3 acts as a substitute
for the SEI layer due to the formation of Li–Al–O in
the first few cycles, which is a good ionic conductor, blocking the
electron transfer efficiently.39,40,43

In this work, for the first time, the vertically aligned TiO2 nanotube layers prepared by anodization were coated with
thin Al2O3 layers of different thicknesses by
ALD (i.e., 0.2, 1, 2, 5, and 10 nm corresponding to of 2, 9, 18, 46,
and 92 ALD cycles, respectively) and examined as potential anodes
for LIBs. The results were compared to that of the uncoated TiO2 nanotube layers.

Experimental Section
TiO2 nanotube layers, with a thickness of ∼5
μm and a diameter of ∼230 nm, were prepared according
to the previously published work.44 In
brief, Ti foils (Sigma Aldrich, 0.127 mm thick, 99.7% purity) were
degreased in isopropanol and acetone and afterwards anodized in an
ethylene glycol-based electrolyte containing 150 mM NH4F and 10 vol % H2O at 100 V for 4 h. The electrochemical
cell consisted of a high-voltage potentiostat (PGU-200V; Elektroniklabor
GmbH) in a two-electrode configuration, with a Pt foil as the counter
electrode and Ti foil as the working electrode. After anodization,
the nanotube layers were sonicated in isopropanol and dried in air.
Before further use, all of the TiO2 nanotube layers were
annealed in a muffle oven at 400 °C to receive a crystalline
anatase phase.

The prepared TiO2 nanotube layers
were coated with Al2O3 layers of different thicknesses
using an ALD
tool (thermal ALD, TFS 200, Beneq). Trimethylaluminum (TMA, Strem,
elec. grade, 99.999+%) and deionized water (18 MΩ) were used
as aluminum and oxygen precursors, respectively. Under these deposition
conditions, one ALD Al2O3 growth cycle was defined
by the following sequence: TMA pulse (100 ms)–N2 purge (2 s)–H2O pulse (100 ms)–N2 purge (3 s). All processes were carried out at a temperature of
200 °C, using N2 (99.9999%) as the carrier gas, at
a flow rate of 400 sccm. Al2O3 coatings of different
thicknesses were deposited within the TiO2 nanotube layers.
The number of cycles required for the different Al2O3 thicknesses was estimated from the growth per cycle value
of the Al2O3 process at 200 °C (∼1.1
Å/cycle). Thus, ALD processes of 2, 9, 18, 46, and 92 cycles
led to nominal Al2O3 coating thicknesses of
0.2, 1, 2, 5, and 10 nm, respectively.

The structure and morphology
of the TiO2 nanotube layers
were characterized by a field-emission electron microscope (FE-SEM
JEOL JSM 7500F). Dimensions of the nanotubes were measured and statistically
evaluated using proprietary Nanomeasure software.

The electrochemical
performance of the ALD Al2O3-coated TiO2 nanotube layers was studied using
Swagelok-type cells. The TiO2 nanotube layers were assembled
with metallic Li (Aldrich) as the counter electrode, with a glass
fiber (Whatman) used as a separator. The electrolyte consisted of
a solution of 1 M LiPF6 in ethylene carbonate (EC)/diethyl
carbonate (DEC) (1:1, in w/w) (Sigma Aldrich). The cells were assembled
in an argon-filled glovebox (MBraun, Germany), with <0.5 ppm H2O and <0.5 ppm O2 atmosphere. Galvanostatic
tests were carried out using a VMP3 potentiostat (Bio Logic, France).
The cells were cycled at 1C (∼1 h charge/discharge) in a potential
window of 1–3 V. The current was applied considering the mass
of the TiO2 nanotube layers and was calculated considering
a density of 4.23 g/cm3 and porosity of 76%. The porosity
calculation is based on the amount of the TiO2 nanotubes
per cm2. The volume occupied by the TiO2 nanotubes
was calculated by subtracting the inner tube area from outer tube
area.

The chronoamperometric (CA) tests were conducted in a
three-electrode
Swagelok cell. The uncoated and the 1 and 2 nm ALD Al2O3-coated TiO2 nanotube layer electrodes were assembled
against one Li foil serving as a counter electrode and another Li
foil as a reference electrode. Two separators were placed between
each electrode soaked in a solution of 1 M LiPF6 in EC/DEC
(1:1, in w/w) obtained from Sigma Aldrich. The CA tests were performed
by applying a constant potential of 1.7 V for 80 s using a VMP3 potentiostat–galvanostat
(Bio Logic).

For electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS)
measurements,
the nanotube layers were assembled in a three-electrode system, with
separate Li foils as the reference and counter electrodes, using Whatman
paper as the separator. EC/DEC with 1 M LiPF6 was used
as the electrolyte. The cells were kept for 24 h at open circuit potential
(OCP) to get stabilized. The AC impedance measurements were carried
out using a VMP3 Biologic Potentiostat at OCP in a frequency range
of 100 kHz to 10 mHz at amplitude of 10 mV. The obtained spectra were
fitted by “Z-fit” in the EC-Lab software (Bio Logic).

Results
and Discussion
Figure 1 shows SEM
images of the top (a, b) and bottom parts (c, d) of the uncoated TiO2 nanotube layer and the 10 nm Al2O3-coated
TiO2 nanotube layer. As can be seen, the wall thickness
on top of the nanotube layers increased from the uncoated to 10 nm
ALD Al2O3-coated TiO2 nanotube layers.
At the bottom parts, thin layers of Al2O3 could
be observed on the inside as well as outside of the nanotube walls.
The thin layers were visible due to the different mass contrasts between
TiO2 and Al2O3. In line with our
previous work, the ALD Al2O3 coatings on the
TiO2 nanotube layers were very uniform and homogenous.26

Figure 1 SEM images of the top (a, b) and bottom parts (c, d) of
the uncoated
TiO2 nanotube layer (a, c) and 10 nm ALD Al2O3-coated TiO2 nanotube layer (b, d). The inset
in (c) shows an illustrative image of the whole TiO2 nanotube
layer, revealing a thickness of ∼5 μm.

It has to be noted that the double-walled structure
that can be
seen at the bottom parts of both the uncoated and coated nanotube
layers is an intrinsic feature of the TiO2 nanotube layers
prepared in ethylene glycol-based electrolytes and is well known from
the literature.45

Figure 2a–d
shows the charge/discharge profiles obtained by chronopotentiometry
in the potential range of 1.0–3.0 V for the uncoated TiO2 nanotubes (taken as reference), 0.2 nm Al2O3, 1 nm Al2O3, and 2 nm ALD Al2O3-coated TiO2 nanotube layers recorded at
1C. In all of the cases, the presence of two plateaus is attributed
to the reversible insertion of Li+ into crystalline anatase
TiO2. In the discharge profile, the plateau at ∼1.75
V corresponds to the accommodation of Li+, according to
a reduction reaction. In the charge profile, the plateau at ∼1.95
V was induced by the extraction of Li+, according to an
oxidation reaction. The reversible insertion reaction of Li+ in anatase TiO2 is given by eq 1(1) 1  As can be
seen in Figure 2a–d,
the presence of Al2O3 coating clearly had a
strong influence on the electrochemical
performance of the TiO2 nanotube electrodes. Indeed, the
areal and gravimetric capacities grew with increasing Al2O3 thickness until a maximum value for the 1 nm Al2O3-coated TiO2 nanotube layers and then
decreased for the TiO2 nanotube layers with thicker coatings.
The gravimetric capacities were calculated on the basis of an estimated
porosity of 76%. It must be noted that the porosity of the nanotube
layers is just an estimated value and therefore the gravimetric capacities
are not as accurate as the areal capacities. The theoretical capacity
of TiO2 is 336 mAh/g for 1 mol of Li-ion insertion. For
the fully reversible reaction, TiO2 inserts a maximum of
0.5 mol Li ions, giving a theoretical capacity of 168 mAh/g.1 Thus, the theoretical capacity is not reached
for 1 nm coatings, according to our porosity calculation. However,
the calculated gravimetric capacity for the nanotube layers with 1
nm coating was 149 mAh/g for the first cycle at a C rate of C/5 (Figure 2f,g), which is very
close to the theoretical value of 168 mAh/g, especially taking the
above mentioned accuracy into account.

and (g) galvanostatic discharge/charge curves of the first reversible

Figure 2e shows
dependence of the first discharge capacity delivered by the TiO2 nanotube layers coated by Al2O3, using
various coating thicknesses. After being coated with 1 nm Al2O3, the areal capacity was more than 2 times higher compared
to that of the reference (∼200 vs ∼75 μAh/cm2, respectively), whereas for thicker Al2O3 coatings, the areal capacity decreased significantly. More remarkably,
after the charge/discharge tests, the capacity remained almost 3 times
higher than that for the reference (∼164 vs ∼60 μAh/cm2, respectively).

Reasons for the enhancement of capacity
on the Al2O3-coated TiO2 nanotube
layers are at least 2-fold.
At first, an inhibition of the significant volume changes of the TiO2 nanotubes during Li insertion due to an improved mechanical
stability should be considered. An improved mechanical and chemical
stability of the ALD Al2O3-coated TiO2 nanotube arrays was recently reported by the Macak group,46 showing that already thin Al2O3 coatings of 1 nm have a beneficial effect. Moreover, it was
reported that an addition of Al2O3 can stabilize
the mesoporous anatase TiO2 structures upon Li insertion.47 However, SEM analyses of the electrodes was
carried out after 100 charge/discharge cycles, presented in Figure 2. All of the nanotube
layers preserved their architecture (see Figure S1) without any noticeable change or damage.

The second
reason for the enhanced capacity is a better diffusion
of the Li+ ions within the Al2O3-coated
TiO2 nanotube layers, which might be explained by changes
in the Al2O3 layer upon galvanostatic experiments.
Xiao et al.41 found that the structure
of the ultrathin Al2O3 changes to Al2O3/AlF3 during cycling, providing a better
Li+-ion conductivity and formation of LiAlO2 on the surface that can promote Li insertion by reducing the associated
energy barrier.

However, on the basis of Figure 2, a suppression of the SEI layer due to Al2O3 coatings can be excluded, even though Al2O3 coatings are typically discussed in the literature39,40,43 as inhibitors of SEI formation.
It is also known that on the TiO2 anodes only very thin
SEI layers are formed when electrochemical cycling experiments are
performed at potentials higher than 1 V.2,11,48 Indeed, from Figure 2 it is clear that the capacity loss during the first
charge/discharge cycle (when SEI typically forms) was very low for
the uncoated TiO2 nanotube layer, suggesting that only
a very thin SEI layer was formed. In contrast, the capacity loss during
the first charge/discharge cycle was much more pronounced for the
Al2O3-coated TiO2 nanotube layers.
This high irreversible capacity of the ALD Al2O3-coated TiO2 nanotube layers might be caused by Li-containing
Al2O3 phase formation.39 It is believed that the insulating Al2O3 layers
cause a potential drop and also slow down Li diffusion during the
first cycle. Thereafter, Al2O3 reacts with the
electrolyte and forms AlF3, which facilitates the charge
transfer.39 It was also suggested that
lithiation of the Al2O3 coating layer proceeds
until a thermodynamically stable phase is reached (corresponding to
Li3.4Al2O3).49 The extra Li+ ions then overflow into the electrode passing
through the coating layer. If the Al2O3 coating
layer is too thick, a longer time would be needed until the thermodynamically
stable phase is reached.49 This explains
that thicker Al2O3 coatings blocked Li diffusion
into TiO2 and therefore the areal capacity decreased for
the thicker Al2O3 coatings within the TiO2 nanotube layers, as can be seen in Figure 2e. Furthermore, a higher amount of Li+ from the electrolyte is needed to build a thermodynamically
stable phase Li3.4Al2O3 for the thicker
Al2O3 layers, reducing the charge/discharge
capacities.

Additionally, calculations of the diffusion coefficients
using
chronoamperometry and the Cottrell equation were carried out after
cycling the cell for three cycles at 1C rate to facilitate formation
of the Li–Al–O phase (see Figure S2). The diffusion coefficients calculated for the uncoated
(0 cycles ALD) and 1 nm (9 cycles) ALD Al2O3-coated TiO2 nanotube layers were 1 × 10–16 and 1.44 × 10–16 cm2 s–1, respectively, which shows the positive influence of Al2O3 on Li+ diffusion. For the 2 nm (18 cycles)
ALD Al2O3-coated TiO2 nanotube layers,
the diffusion coefficient was estimated to be 9 × 10–17 cm2 s–1, suggesting that at a higher
Al2O3 thickness Li+ diffusion is
hindered.

Lindstrom et al.50 have
reported an
Li+ diffusion coefficient of 1 × 10–17 cm2 s–1 for nanoporous anatase TiO2 using chronoamperometry. Apart from the positive influence
of the thin Al2O3 coating on the TiO2 nanotubes shown for our samples, the higher Li+ diffusion
also indicates that one-dimensional nanomaterials (like the vertical
aligned nanotubes) could help promote better charge diffusion compared
with nanoporous films.

These results are also in agreement with
findings reported in the
literature. Lipson et al.43 observed for
an ALD Al2O3-coated MnO electrode that Li+ was unable to diffuse through the thick Al2O3 films and thus the thick ALD Al2O3 films
blocked the electrode surface. Ultrathin Al2O3 films (9 Å thick), however, inhibited SEI formation without
blocking the electrode surface.

Considering the superior performance
for the 1 nm Al2O3-coated TiO2 nanotube
layer at 1C, cycling
tests at faster kinetics have been explored to study the rate capability
of this coating in more detail. As shown in Figure 2f, the discharge capacities of the first
reversible cycle were ∼295, ∼158, ∼84, ∼65,
and ∼59 μAh/cm2 for C/5, 1C, 2C, 3C, and 5C,
respectively. As expected, the areal capacity decreased with an increased
C rate due to the higher applied current density. Figure 2g shows the galvanostatic discharge/charge
curves of the first reversible cycle of the uncoated and the 1 and
2 nm ALD Al2O3-coated TiO2 nanotube
layer at 0.2C. As can be seen, the theoretical gravimetric capacity
was just reached in the case of the 1 nm ALD Al2O3-coated TiO2 nanotube layer, taking accuracy of the porosity
calculation into account. It can be pointed out that these high capacity
values obtained for the 1 nm ALD Al2O3-coated
TiO2 nanotube layer were only obtained by the uncoated
TiO2 nanotube layers at very slow kinetics (C/10).

The coulombic efficiencies (CEs) for the first charge/discharge
cycles for the uncoated and 1 nm ALD Al2O3-coated
TiO2 nanotube layers are given in Table 1. As expected, the CE for the uncoated TiO2 nanotube layer was very high from the first charge/discharge
cycle. The CE of the 1 nm ALD Al2O3-coated TiO2 nanotube layer, however, is comparably lower during the first
10 cycles. This is probably due to the formation of the Li–Al–O
phase during the first charge/discharge cycles.

Figure 3a depicts
the discharge capacities of the uncoated TiO2 nanotube
layer and the 1 nm Al2O3-coated TiO2 nanotube layer for the 100 charge/discharge cycles at 1C. After
an initial decrease of the capacity during the initial discharge cycle,
more than 2 times higher capacity was attained for the 1 nm Al2O3-coated TiO2 nanotube layer compared
to that of the reference. However, a very slight decrease of the discharge
capacity could be seen for the uncoated nanotube layer, whereas for
the 1 nm Al2O3-coated TiO2 nanotube
layer, an increase of the discharge capacity was clearly visible during
the first cycles. This increase might be explained with an increase
in conductivity of the Al2O3 coating during
the electrochemical cycling, as explained above. All in all, the 2-fold
difference was preserved even after extensive cycling.

higher magnification of the first semicycle.

EIS measurements were performed to further elucidate the
effect
of the Al2O3 coatings on TiO2 nanotube
layers. Figure 3b shows
the overlaid impedance spectra of both samples and their fittings
at OCP. The figure demonstrates the excellent agreement between the
experimental and fit data. The equivalent circuit for the EIS spectra
of the uncoated TiO2 nanotube layer is represented by [Re + RCT/QCT + Q], shown in Figure 4a, where R represents resistors and Q, constant
phase elements (CPEs). Re represents essentially
the resistance of the electrolyte. The depressed semicircle at the
medium frequency and the sloped line at low frequencies represent
the charge-transfer impedance (RCT/QCT) of the lithium intercalation process and
the capacitive effect (Q), respectively. From the
fit data of the EIS spectra, RCT for the
uncoated TiO2 nanotube layer was 692.2 Ω.

Figure 4 Equivalent
circuits for the EIS plots of the (a) uncoated and (b)
1 nm ALD Al2O3-coated TiO2 nanotube
layers.

The EIS spectrum for the Al2O3-coated TiO2 nanotube layer consists
of two semicircles. The first depressed
semicircle at high frequency is attributed to the impedance due to
the Al2O3 coating on the nanotube layer51 and the second semicircle in the medium frequency
range to the impedance due to the charge transfer resistance. The
equivalent circuit shown in Figure 4b for the 1 nm Al2O3-coated TiO2 nanotube layer is [Re + RAl2O3/QAl2O3 + RCT/QCT + Q]. From the
fit data, RAl2O3 and RCT were calculated to be 56.07
and 289.1 Ω, respectively. The exponent for the last CPE was
0.8 for both samples, which suggests largely a capacitive effect.
The lower RCT for the 1 nm ALD Al2O3-coated TiO2 nanotube layer revealed
a positive influence of the Al2O3 coating in
enhancing the electronic conductivity of the TiO2 nanotube
layer.

Another advantage of the Al2O3 coating
is
that it can also prevent the electrolyte side reactions with TiO2 during the charge/discharge process, thereby suppressing
any passivation layer on the surface of the TiO2 nanotube
layer.

Conclusions
In summary, it was demonstrated that the
ALD coating of the TiO2 nanotube layers, with thin layers
(≤1 nm) of Al2O3, have a beneficial effect
on the areal capacity
and cycling behavior of the TiO2 nanotube layers. This
is due to an increased mechanical stability of the nanotube layers
upon Al2O3 coating and a better diffusion of
the Li+ ions within the Al2O3-coated
TiO2 nanotube layers. On the other hand, Al2O3 coatings with thickness >2 nm show a reduced capacity.
The approach presented in this work is important for future applications
of the TiO2 nanotube layers, where a thin and highly conformal
coating of the secondary material can significantly enhance the performance
of the TiO2 nanotube layers and explore these composite
nanotube layers for new applications, previously unfeasible for the
uncoated (bare) TiO2 nanotube layers.
