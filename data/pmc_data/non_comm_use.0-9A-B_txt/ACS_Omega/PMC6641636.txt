We have synthesized novel chiral
polymers containing a cinchona-based
squaramide in the main chain. We designed a novel cinchona squaramide
dimer that contains two cinchona squaramide units connected by diamines.
The olefinic double bonds in the cinchona squaramide dimer were used
for Mizoroki–Heck (MH) polymerization with aromatic diiodides.
The MH polymerization of the cinchona squaramide dimer and aromatic
diiodide proceeded well to give the corresponding chiral polymers
in good yields. The catalytic activity of the chiral polymers was
investigated for asymmetric Michael addition reactions. The effect
of the squaramide structure of the polymeric catalyst on the catalytic
performance is discussed in detail. We have surveyed the influence
of the chiral polymer structure on the catalytic activity and enantioselectivity
of the asymmetric reaction. The asymmetric Michael addition of β-ketoesters
to nitroolefins was successfully catalyzed by polymeric cinchona squaramide
organocatalysts to obtain the corresponding Michael adducts in good
yields with excellent enantio- and diastereoselectivities. The polymeric
catalysts were insoluble in commonly used organic solvents and easily
recovered from the reaction mixture and reused several times without
the loss of catalytic activity.

Introduction
In asymmetric synthesis,
the use of chiral organocatalysts has
played an important role in synthetic strategy mainly because of their
high performance and lack of toxic metal species. Chiral organocatalysts
have made significant contributions to green chemical processes. Cinchona
alkaloids and their derivatives have been widely used as chiral organocatalysts
in asymmetric synthesis1−6 because they show excellent catalytic activity for several asymmetric
reactions. Cinchona alkaloids have various functionalities, including
a quinuclidine tertiary nitrogen, a secondary alcohol, a quinoline
ring, and a vinylic unit in their structure. The chemical modification
of the functionalities enables us to design catalysts suitable for
a range of tasks, including polymeric catalysts.7−9

Important
chiral cinchona-derived organocatalysts are their squaramide
derivatives, which were successfully introduced in the pioneering
work of Rawal.10 Cinchona-derived squaramide
derivatives show highly efficient catalytic activity for asymmetric
Michael-type reactions.11,12 The cinchona squaramides
possess an acidic NH that can act as an H-bond donor, and the tertiary
nitrogen of the quinuclidine of cinchona alkaloids may serve as both
an H-bond acceptor and a base in asymmetric Michael addition reactions.
Based on the seminal work of Rawal and co-workers on cinchona squaramide
organocatalysts,10 various modifications
to the cinchona squaramides have been developed and utilized in different
types of Michael addition reactions.13−24 Fine-tuning the cinchona squaramide catalysts for each asymmetric
reaction has resulted in efficient catalytic activity for this type
of reaction. The asymmetric Michael addition reaction is a powerful
tool for the C–C bond formation and can be applied for the
synthesis of different types of important chiral building blocks.
Besides their applications to asymmetric catalysis, the cinchona squaramides
have been successfully applied in molecular recognition25 and supramolecular assemblies based on their
efficient formation of hydrogen bonds.26

Polymer-immobilized catalysts have recently attracted much
attention
in organic synthesis. Chiral catalysts attached to cross-linked polymers
having a random structure, such as polystyrene, have also been extensively
used in asymmetric synthesis. Some of these polymeric systems have
been utilized in continuous-flow systems because of their insolubility.27 In comparison with random-polymer-immobilized
chiral catalysts, chiral polymers containing a chiral catalyst moiety
in the main chain repeat unit of the polymer have not been studied
significantly. We have developed some chiral polymers containing cinchona
alkaloid moieties in their main chain structure using polymerization
techniques such as etherification polymerization,28 Mizoroki–Heck (MH) polymerization,29−31 ion-exchange polymerization,32,33 and neutralization
polymerization.34,35 The chiral polymers previously
prepared have been applied to various kinds of asymmetric transformations
and show excellent catalytic activities. The fine-tuning of the catalyst
conformation is easily achieved in the case of chiral main chain polymers.
Interestingly, some main chain chiral polymer catalysts show higher
stereoselectivities than those of the original low-molecular-weight
catalysts. This could be due to the specific conformations created
by the chiral main chain polymers.7−9

In this article,
we focus on novel cinchona squaramide dimers 5 containing
diamine linkers and their polymers 7P prepared by MH
polymerization. The cinchona squaramide dimers 5 we have
developed in this study contain two terminal olefin
structures at the C3 position of both cinchona moieties. One of the
most reliable C–C-bond-forming reaction for such olefinic double
bonds is the Mizoroki–Heck (MH) coupling reaction with aromatic
iodides.36−38 Although some achiral polymers have been synthesized
using the MH reaction,39 there have been
no examples of chiral polymer synthesis using this method, except
for binol derivative40 and our previous
report.29−31 For the synthesis of novel chiral polymers from the
cinchona squaramide dimers, we applied the MH polymerization.

To evaluate the catalytic activity and the stereoselectivity of
the polymeric organocatalysts, the resulting main chain chiral polymers
were used as polymeric chiral organocatalysts for the asymmetric Michael
addition of β-ketoesters to nitroolefins. The effects of the
chiral polymer structure on the catalytic activity and stereoselectivity
of the asymmetric reaction have been investigated. Because of their
insolubility in commonly used organic solvents, we also surveyed the
recycling of the polymer organocatalysts.

Results and Discussion
Synthesis
of Cinchona Squaramide Polymers
Dimethylsquarate, 1, is highly reactive toward primary amines, yielding squaramides.
Thus, 2 equiv of dimethylsquarate, 1, easily reacted
with diamines (2) to give the squaramide dimers (3) in high yield. We prepared different kinds of squaramide
dimers (3) from several diamines (2), including
chiral diamines (Scheme 1). The remaining methoxy groups in the dimers (3) are
still active toward amines, and the hydroxyl group at C9 of the cinchona
alkaloid can be easily transformed into the amino derivative. The
C9-amino derivative of quinine (4Q) was synthesized by
Mitsunobu-type azide formation, followed by the Staudinger reaction
according to the reported procedure.41 A
squaramide dimer (3) was then allowed to react with the
amino group of 4Q to give the cinchona squaramide dimer 5Q, as shown in Scheme 2. This reaction required the use of excess amount of 4Q (3 equiv) at a high reaction temperature (60–75
°C) in chloroform, mainly because of the steric hindrance of
the cinchona-derived amine. In the case of 1,6-hexanediamine (2c), tetrahydrofuran (THF) was used as the solvent because 2c was well-soluble in THF. When cinchonidine-derived amine 4C(42) was used instead of 4Q, the corresponding cinchona squaramide dimeric compound
(5C) was obtained.

Scheme 1 Synthesis of Squaramide Dimers (3)
Scheme 2 Synthesis of Cinchona
Squaramide Dimers (5)
The cinchona squaramide dimers (5Q, 5C) possess two C3-vinyl groups in their structure. These
vinyl groups
are applicable to the Mizoroki–Heck (MH) reaction with aromatic
iodides. When diiodo aromatic compounds are used with cinchona squaramide
dimers 5, repeated MH reactions occur to give chiral
polymers (Scheme 3).
Thus, repeated MH reactions occurred between cinchona squaramide dimers
(5) and various aromatic diiodides (6) in
the presence of Pd(OAc)2 catalyst to give chiral squaramide
polymers (7P, Schemes 3 and 4). After polymerization, the reaction mixture was precipitated in
ether to give the polymer powder. The chiral polymers (7P) were soluble only in highly polar solvents such as dimethylformamide
(DMF) and dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO).

They were not soluble
in commonly used organic solvents, including
ether, chloroform, THF, hexane, toluene, ethyl acetate, and methanol. Table 1 summarizes the results
of the MH polymerization of cinchona squaramide dimers 5 and aromatic diiodides 6. In all cases, chiral polymers
(7P) having molecular weights of about 4000 were obtained
in high yield. When cinchonidine derivative 5C was used
for the MH polymerization, a longer reaction time was required to
obtain a high yield of polymer 7P (entries 5 and 6).

Catalytic Performance of the Cinchona Squaramide Dimers (5)
and Their Polymers (7P)
To investigate the catalytic
activity of the novel cinchona squaramide derivatives, asymmetric
Michael addition reactions between 2-oxocyclopentanecarboxylate (8) and trans-β-nitrostyrene (9) was tested with cinchona squaramide dimers 5 as asymmetric catalysts. Rawal’s original cinchona squaramide
(11, Figure 1), derived from cinchonine, shows excellent catalytic activity
in asymmetric Michael reactions.10 The
reaction of 8 and 9 gave the chiral product
in 75% yield, with 93% ee for the major diastereomer using 11 as the catalyst (Table 2, entry 1).

See ref (10).

Our cinchona squaramide dimers 5 also showed high
performance in the same reaction. Table 2 summarizes the results of asymmetric Michael
reaction of 8 and 9 using 5 as catalysts. In the presence of 5Qa, the reaction
smoothly occurred in THF at room temperature to give the Michael adduct 10 in 76% isolated yield, with 98% ee for the major diastereomer
(Table 2, entry 2).
The diastereomeric ratio (dr) of the product was also very high (>100:1).
The main stereoisomer of four possible isomers obtained in this reaction
was 10. The same reaction in methanol proceeded to give 10 but with lower stereoselectivity, diastereoselectivity,
and enantioselectivity (entry 3). In dichloromethane, a somewhat longer
reaction time was required compared to that in THF (entry 4). The
effect of the diamine linker (R in 5) was also investigated. 5Qb, prepared from (S,S)-amine 2b, had a slightly
decreased enantioselectivity compared to that obtained with 5Qa (entry 5). An appropriate combination of the cinchona
moiety and diamine linker in this catalyst is 5Qa, prepared
from (R,R)-amine 2a. The use of a flexible achiral methylene chain linker (2c) resulted in a lower stereoselectivity in the asymmetric induction
(entry 6). The (R,R)-1,2-diaminocyclohexane
linker (2d) also resulted in a lower stereoselectivity
(entry 7). The cyclohexane ring may induce an unfavorable conformation
at the catalytic site. Cinchonidine-derived squaramide dimers also
catalyzed the same reaction with somewhat lower reactivity and stereoselectivity
(entries 8 and 9). The results obtained by using cinchona squaramide
dimers 5 encouraged us to apply the corresponding polymers
(7P) for catalysis in the same asymmetric reaction. The
chiral polymer 7PQaa, prepared from 5Qa and
1,4-diiodobenzene (6a), was first used as a polymeric
catalyst. 7PQaa was insoluble in commonly used organic
solvents and was, thus, suspended in THF. The substrates (8 and 9) were dissolved in THF, and 7PQaa was added to initiate the reaction. Even in the heterogeneous system
using the insoluble polymeric catalyst, the reaction proceeded smoothly
(Table 3). After stirring
for 22 h at room temperature, the consumption of 8 was
confirmed by thin-layer chromatography (TLC). The polymeric chiral
catalyst 7PQaa suspended in the reaction mixture was
easily removed by filtration. The desired product was isolated from
the filtrate. In the presence of 7PQaa, the asymmetric
Michael reaction smoothly occurred in THF to give 10.
The stereoselectivity (dr = 60:1, 95% ee) obtained with 7PQaa was as high as that with the corresponding low-molecular-weight
catalyst 5Qa (Table 2, entry 1 vs Table 3, entry 1). Of the chiral polymeric catalysts, 7PQba gave the highest enantioselectivity in THF solvent (Table 3, entry 2). The cinchonidine-derived
polymers 7PCaa and 7PCba also showed a high
level of stereoselectivities (entries 5 and 6). Interestingly, most
of the chiral polymer catalysts 7P afforded the chiral
product 10 with higher enantioselectivities compared
to those of the corresponding low-molecular-weight catalysts 5 under the same reaction conditions (Tables 2 and 3). Some conformational
differences between the catalytic sites of dimeric catalysts 5 and those of chiral polymers 7P might give
rise to a positive effect on the enantioselectivity in the asymmetric
reaction.

Next, we surveyed the solvent effects on the catalytic
performances
of the chiral cinchona squaramide polymers 7P. In addition
to THF, we chose dichloromethane, ethyl acetate, acetonitrile, hexane,
and toluene as examples of commonly used organic solvents. The 7P polymers were all insoluble in these solvents. The asymmetric
reaction proceeded in the heterogeneous system in these solvents.

The reaction smoothly occurred to give 10 with even
higher enantioselectivities of up to 99% ee. In dichloromethane, the
asymmetric reaction occurred with polymeric catalyst 7PQaa to give 10 in a diastereomeric ratio 65:1 (Table 4, entry 1). The enantioselectivity
of the major diastereomers was 99% ee. This result also shows the
higher stereoselectivity in the asymmetric induction compared with
that obtained with the corresponding low-molecular-weight dimeric
catalyst (5Qa) in the same solvent (Table 2, entry 3). Acetonitrile and
methanol were also suitable solvents for the same reaction with 7PQaa, giving 10 in 99% ee (entries 3 and 5).
In acetonitrile, an even higher diastereoselectivity (>100:1) was
obtained with 7PQaa. Toluene gave a lower stereoselectivity
with the polymeric catalyst (entry 7). The effect of temperature on
the catalytic performance was also investigated. The use of a higher
reaction temperature reduced the reaction time required to achieve
completion (entry 10). In dichloromethane, the stereoselectivity was
not influenced by changing the reaction temperature in the range of
−10 to 40 °C (entries 1, 9, and 10). Interestingly, very
high stereoselectivity was maintained, even under reflux conditions,
in dichloromethane (entry 10).

We then used some other cinchona squaramide polymer
organocatalysts
for the same asymmetric reaction. Table 5 summarizes the results obtained by using 7PQ in methanol at room temperature. In all cases, excellent
stereoselectivities were obtained with 7PQ. Various combinations
of R and Ar in 7PQ (R′ = OMe) were chosen for
the polymeric catalyst structure and showed no significant effect
on the stereoselectivities, as shown in Table 5.

Because the chiral polymers were completely insoluble
in commonly
used organic solvents, the asymmetric reactions were carried out in
a heterogeneous system. The use of the 7P polymeric organocatalysts
allowed easy separation of the catalyst from the reaction mixture
by simple filtration. The recovered polymer could be reused several
times in the same asymmetric reaction. The catalyst recyclability
was examined by using the 7PQaa polymeric organocatalyst
in methanol. After the reaction had completed, the polymer was easily
separated from the reaction mixture and washed with organic solvent.
The recovered polymer was then used for subsequent reactions. Although
the second reuse gave somewhat lower enantioselectivity (Table 6, entry 1), the catalytic
performance of 7PQaa was maintained for several repeated
cycles.

We applied chiral polymer 7PQaa as an
organocatalyst
in the asymmetric Michael addition of various kinds of substrates.
The reaction between ethyl 2-oxocyclopentanecarboxylate and trans-β-nitrostyrene proceeded smoothly in methanol
to give the corresponding asymmetric product in high yield with excellent
enantioselectivity (Table 7, entry 1). Methyl 2-oxocyclopentanecarboxylate 8 was allowed to react with several Michael acceptors, including 4-fluoro-trans-β-nitrostyrene, 4-methyl-trans-β-nitrostyrene, (2-nitrovinyl)thiophene, and N-benzylmaleimide. The reactions occurred smoothly in the presence
of 7PQaa to give the corresponding Michael adducts (Table 7, entries 2–5).
The stereoselectivities of the chiral products obtained from methyl-trans-β-nitrostyrene (entry 3) and N-benzylmaleimide (entry 5) were not determined because of the incomplete
separation of the products by chiral high-performance liquid chromatography
analysis. The reactivity of N-benzylmaleimide as
a Michael acceptor was relatively low compared to those of the nitroolefins
(Table 7, entries 5–7).
Finally, almost racemic products were obtained in the products with
α-acetylbutyrolactone and 2-acetylcyclopentanone (entries 6
and 7).

Conclusions
In
summary, we have successfully synthesized novel chiral cinchona
squaramide dimers (5). Mizoroki–Heck (MH) polymerization
smoothly occurred between 5 and various kinds of aromatic
diiodides to give chiral polymers (7P). Although the 7P polymers were insoluble in commonly used organic solvents,
the Michael reaction of β-ketoesters to nitroolefins was efficiently
catalyzed by 7P to afford the corresponding Michael adducts
with a high stereoselectivity. In particular, in the case of the reaction
of 2-oxocyclopentanecarboxylate 8 and trans-β-nitrostyrene 9 in the presence of 7P, one stereoisomer, 10, was produced almost exclusively
of four possible stereoisomers with high diastereoselectivity (dr
> 100:1) and high enantioselectivity (up to 99% ee). The insolubility
of the chiral polymeric catalysts allowed us to recover the catalysts
from the reaction mixture by simple filtration for reuse several times
without significant loss of catalytic activity.

Experimental Section
Materials
and General Considerations
All the solvents
and reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, Wako Pure Chemical
Industries, Ltd., or Tokyo Chemical Industry (TCI) Co., Ltd. at the
highest available purity and used as received. Reactions were monitored
by thin-layer chromatography using precoated silica gel plates (Merck
5554, 60F254). Column chromatography was performed using a silica
gel column (Wakogel C-200, 100–200 mesh). Melting points were
recorded using a Yanaco micromelting apparatus, and the values were
not corrected. The NMR spectra were recorded on JEOL JNM-ECS400 spectrometers
in CDCl3 or DMSO-d6 at room
temperature operating at 400 MHz (1H) and 100 MHz (13C{1H}). Tetramethylsilane (TMS) was used as an
internal standard for 1H NMR and CDCl3 for 13C NMR. The chemical shifts are reported in parts per million
(ppm) using TMS as a reference, and the J values
are reported in hertz. The IR spectra were recorded on a JEOL JIR-7000
Fourier transform infrared spectrometer and reported in reciprocal
centimeters (cm–1). The high-resolution mass spectrometry
(HRMS) electrospray ionization (ESI) spectra were recorded on a micro-TOF-Q
II HRMS/MS instrument (Bruker). The high-performance liquid chromatography
(HPLC) was performed with a Jasco HPLC system composed of a DG-980-50
three-line degasser, a PU-980 HPLC pump, and a CO-965 column oven
equipped with a chiral column (Chiralpak OD-H, Daicel) with hexane/2-propanol
as the eluent. A Jasco UV-975 UV detector was used for peak detection.

The size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) was performed using a Tosoh
HLC 8020 instrument with UV (254 nm) or refractive index detection.
The DMF was used as the carrier solvent at a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min
at 40 °C. Two polystyrene gel columns of 10 μm bead size
were used. A calibration curve was made to determine the number average
molecular weight (Mn) and molecular weight
distribution (Mw/Mn) values with polystyrene standards. The optical rotation
was recorded using a JASCO DIP-149 digital polarimeter using a 10
cm thermostatted microcell.

Then, the solvent was removed in vacuo and the crude residue was precipitated
in diethyl ether (70–80 mL) 3–4 times. The solid precipitate
was filtered and dried in a vacuum oven at 40 °C for 3–4
h to afford 215 mg (80% yield) of the product 7PQaa as

Representative Procedure for the Enantioselective
Michael addition
of β-Ketoesters to Nitroolefins
The asymmetric Michael
reaction was carried out with methyl 2-oxocyclopentanecarboxylate, 8 (63 μL, 0.50 mmol), and trans-β-nitrostyrene, 9 (82.05 mg, 0.55 mmol), in a vessel with 2.5 mL of solvent
using squaramide or the polymeric organocatalysts (5 mol %). The reaction
mixture was then stirred at room temperature for the specified time.
After the consumption of substrate 8 (monitored by TLC),
the solvent was evaporated by rotary evaporation. After washing with
ether, the solution was then filtered through a filter paper to recover
the used catalysts from the reaction mixture. The filtrate was concentrated
in vacuo, and the compound was purified by column chromatography on
a silica gel (100–200 mesh) with hexane/EtOAc = 6.0:1.0 as
and eluent to afford the title addition compound as a colorless oil. 1H NMR (400 MHz, 25 °C, CDCl3); δ = 7.29–7.23
(m, 5H), 5.14 (dd, J = 13.8 Hz, 3.8 Hz, 1H), 5.00

(m, 2H), 2.04–1.84.

The other asymmetric Michael additions
were performed in the same manner; the results are summarized in Tables 2–7.

Typical Procedure for the Recycle Use of
the Polymeric Catalyst
For the recycle use of the insoluble
polymeric catalyst, after
the reaction completed, methanol was removed in vacuo. Ether (3 mL)
was added to the reaction mixture and stirred for 30 min. The ether
layer was decanted carefully. The polymer was further washed with
ether (3 × 2 mL). From the ether solution, the product was isolated.
The polymeric catalyst was then dried and reused for the next reaction.
