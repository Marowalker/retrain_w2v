The impact of light-induced degradation
(LID) of silicon photoelectrodes
on the solar-to-hydrogen efficiency of photoelectrochemical (PEC)
devices is investigated. To evaluate the effect, stabilized state-of-the-art
thin-film silicon solar cells (after 1000 h of light soaking) were
used as photocathodes in photovoltaic–electrochemical (PV–EC)
device assemblies and their performances were compared to the performances
of the initial solar-cell-based PV–EC devices. A wide range
of photoelectrode configurations (tandem, triple, quadruple) was addressed.
With regard to the widespread
use of multijunction-based photoelectrodes in the literature, the
results presented herein will have a high impact and may serve as
guidelines for the design of photovoltaic devices particularly tailored
for PEC applications, with high stabilities and efficiencies. It is
shown that LID affects the performances of PV and PV–EC devices
in different ways and strongly depends on the photovoltage of the
applied solar cell.

1 Introduction
Light-induced
hydrogen production using the sun as the only source
of energy is particularly suited to contribute to meeting the world’s
energy needs now and in the years to come.1 The application of multijunction thin-film silicon solar cells as
photoelectrodes in integrated photoelectrochemical (PEC) devices is
a promising approach to efficiently split water into its constituents
and thus to generate hydrogen.2−4 However, so far, relatively little
attention has been paid to the effect of light-induced degradation
(LID) of thin-film silicon photoelectrodes in water-splitting devices.
From the pure photovoltaic (PV) application, it is very well known
that after prolonged illumination (up to 1000 h), LID negatively affects
the device performance in single and multijunction solar cells; thus,
this needs to be taken into account.5,6 Considering
the growing interest in the use of thin-film silicon photoelectrodes
for water splitting,7−9,2 it is vital to address
the effect of LID also for PEC applications. We recently studied the
effect of LID for quadruple-junction-based photocathodes10,11and
demonstrated that the effect of LID on the device efficiency is less
pronounced in the PEC configuration compared to that in the PV configuration.

The present study expands beyond this finding and evaluates the
effect of LID on the entire range of multijunction photocathodes suitable
for bias-free water splitting. Both PV and PEC configurations utilizing
tandem-, triple-, and quadruple-junction solar cells are addressed.

The thin-film silicon solar cells were utilized in integrated photovoltaic–electrochemical
(PV–EC) solar water-splitting device assemblies, as depicted
in Figure 1. Following
the taxonomy proposed by Nielander et al.,12 this device configuration is classified as PV-biased electrosynthetic cell and allows for a number of
important advantages compared with other device configurations.13,14 The impact of LID on the PEC device performance, that is, the solar-to-hydrogen
(STH) efficiency, was evaluated in the initial and stabilized (after
1000 h of light soaking) states of the photocathodes in the PV–EC
devices. The obtained results describe to what extent the LID of thin-film
silicon-based photoelectrodes prepared in various configurations impact
the performance of PV–EC devices.

Figure 1 Schematic cross-sectional
view of the integrated PV–EC device
assembly. The photocathode consists of an a-Si:H/a-Si:H/μc-Si:H
triple-junction solar cell with an electrically attached hydrogen
evolution reaction (HER) catalyst (here: Pt). The photocathode is
separated from the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalyst (here:
the RuO2 electrode) by an electrolyte (here: 0.1 M KOH).

The tandem- (a-Si:H/a-Si:H), triple-
(a-Si:H/a-Si:H/μc-Si:H
and a-Si:H/μc-Si:H/μc-Si:H), and quadruple- (a-Si:H/a-Si:H/μc-Si:H/μc-Si:H)
junction solar cells used in this study were developed according to
the particular requirements for water-splitting applications, which
has been described elsewhere.2,15 The cells provide a
broad range of photovoltages, ranging from 1.9 V for the tandem solar
cells up to 2.8 V for the quadruple-junction solar cells.

2 Results and Discussion
Figure 2 displays
the impact of LID on the absolute (a) and normalized (b) photovoltaic
conversion efficiencies, ηPV, at degradation times
of 1000 h for tandem-, triple, and quadruple-junction solar cells.
It is apparent that the quadruple-junction and a-Si:H/μc-Si:H/μc-Si:H
triple-junction solar cells exhibited the highest stabilities against
LID, as the relative degradation in efficiency was below 5% for both
these cell types after 1000 h of illumination. From Figure 2a, it can be seen that the
quadruple cell, which provided an initial efficiency of 12.9%, showed
the highest stabilized efficiency of 12.4% among all investigated
solar cells. When an antireflection foil was attached to the glass
side, an initial efficiency of 13.2% and a stabilized efficiency of
12.6% were recorded for this cell (shown in ref (10)). The conversion efficiencies
of the a-Si:H/a-Si:H tandem-junction and a-Si:H/a-Si:H/μc-Si:H
triple-junction cells decreased considerably more after light soaking
by approximately 15 and 12%, respectively (see Figure 2b).

Figure 2 (a) Photovoltaic conversion efficiency, ηPV, plotted
as a function of the light soaking time for tandem-junction, a-Si:H/a-Si:H
(blue squares); triple-junction, a-Si:H/μc-Si:H/μc-Si:H
(pink triangles) and a-Si:H/a-Si:H/μc-Si:H (green stars); and
quadruple-junction solar cells (black circles). (b) Photovoltaic conversion
efficiency normalized to the initial value as a function of the light
soaking time for the tandem-, triple-, and quadruple-junction solar
cells.

To give a more detailed picture
of the effect of LID on the solar
cell performance, Figure 3a depicts the photocurrent density–voltage curves before
and after LID of the solar cells. As can be deduced from this graph,
the fill factor (FF) was the most affected photovoltaic parameter
for the a-Si:H/a-Si:H tandem-junction and a-Si:H/a-Si:H/μc-Si:H
triple-junction solar cells. An absolute decrease in FF by approximately
8–10% was observed for these two cell types together with a
slight decrease in the short-circuit current density, JSC. The exact PV parameters before and after light soaking
can be found in Table S1 of the Supporting
Information. For the more stable cell types (relative PV degradation
less than 5%), namely, the a-Si:H/μc-Si:H/μc-Si:H triple-junction
and the quadruple-junction solar cells, FF and JSC decreased considerably less compared to that for the other
investigated cell types after light soaking (see Figure 3a and Table S1).

Figure 3 Comparison of the current density–voltage characteristics
under illumination of PV (a) and PV–EC devices (b) based on
“initial” (solid lines) and light soaked (“stabilized”,
dotted lines) multijunction solar cells (same as that in Figure 2). For the PV–EC
devices, a 100 nm thick Pt layer was used as the HER catalyst and
a RuO2 counter electrode, as the OER catalyst. The measurements
were conducted in 0.1 M KOH, at a scan rate of ν = 30 mV/s.
The right ordinate in (b) depicts the achievable STH efficiencies,
ηSTHmax and ηSTHmax, as a function
of the photocurrent density at a 0 V applied bias.

The next step consisted of application of the solar
cells as photocathodes
in the PV–EC device assembly, shown in Figure 1, before and after the light soaking experiment
and comparison of the initial and stabilized STH efficiencies. In Figure 3b, the photocurrent
density−voltage characteristics of the initial (solid curves)
and stabilized (dotted curves) PV–EC device types are plotted
together. From the voltammograms in Figure 3b, the STH efficiency can be approximated
by multiplying the current density at 0 V, recorded under illumination,
which corresponds to the operation point photocurrent density, jop, of the PV–EC devices, with the thermodynamic
potential for water splitting (1.23 V) and dividing the product by
the incident power (100 mW/cm2).2,16 When
assuming that the total photocurrent density is available for hydrogen
production, an estimated maximum achievable STH efficiency, ηSTHmax, can be defined. Among the PV–EC devices based
on the initial solar cells, shown in Figure 3b, the highest ηSTHmax of
8.7% was achieved by the a-Si:H/a-Si:H/μc-Si:H triple-junction-based
PV–EC device. The ηSTHmax values of all devices
are listed in Table 1.

a The ηSTHmax and

is also listed and compared to the relative degradation of the photovoltaic
efficiency, ηPV,stab/ηPV, derived
from Figure 2 and listed
in Table S1.

Among the PV–EC devices based on stabilized
solar cells
(dotted curves in Figure 3b), the a-Si:H/a-Si:H tandem-junction and Si:H/a-Si:H/μc-Si:H
triple-junction devices showed the highest degradation of jop and thus of the STH efficiency (compare the
ηSTHmax and ηSTHmax,stab values
in Table 1). Relative
degradations, ηSTHmax,stab/ηSTHmax, of 0.72 for the tandem-junction-based and 0.88 for the a-Si:H/a-Si:H/μc-Si:H
triple-junction-based PV–EC devices were found (see Table 1). The lowest degradation,
hence the best stability against LID, was achieved by the a-Si:H/μc-Si:H/μc-Si:H
solar cell (pink curves in Figure 3b). This device provided an STH efficiency of 6.4%
after 1000 h of light soaking of the photocathode, which corresponds
to an impressively low degradation of less than 1%. The quadruple-junction
device showed a similar good stability against LID and degraded by
only less than 2%, providing a device efficiency, ηSTHmax,stab, after LID of 7.6% (black curves in Figure 3b).

To illustrate the differences in
the effect of LID on the performances
of the PV and PV–EC devices, Table 1 also lists the relative PV degradation (ηPV,stab/ηPV) in the last column. For all cell types,
the relative efficiency degradation was either equal in both the configurations
or slightly less pronounced in the PV–EC configuration than
that in the PV configuration, except for the a-Si:H/a-Si:H-based device.
For the a-Si:H/a-Si:H-based device, the operation point (current density
at 0 V) lies in the steep slope region of the j–V curve (see Figure 3b). This is a
very critical position for the operation point of the PV–EC
device, where a decrease in FF has a stronger and more detrimental
effect on ηSTHmax than that on the pure PV efficiency.
In the case of PV devices, the conversion efficiency is defined by
the maximum power point (MPP). Thus, ηPV is calculated
using the voltage and photocurrent density at the MPP (see the Vmpp and Jmpp values
in Table S1), irrespective of the location
of the MPP. In the case of PV–EC devices, the conversion efficiency,
ηSTH, is calculated using the photocurrent density
at the operation point (0 V applied bias) and thus strongly depends
on the location of the operation point and on FF. As apparent from Figure 3b, the significant
decrease in FF in a-Si:H/a-Si:H “shifted” the operation
point photocurrent density, jop, to significantly
lower values after LID. For this specific example of a tandem PV–EC
device, the decrease in jop due to its
unfavorable position had a stronger influence than the degradation
of Vmpp and Jmpp in the pure PV configuration, which is why ηSTHmax,stab/ηSTHmax was also decreased to a larger extent compared
with ηPV,stab/ηPV.

The a-Si:H/a-Si:H/μc-Si:H
solar cell showed an equal PV degradation
to that in the a-Si:H/a-Si:H solar cell (see the ηPV,stab/ηPV values in Table 1 and the parameters in Table S1). However, its PV–EC degradation was significantly lower
(see ηSTHmax,stab/ηSTHmax values
of 0.87 vs 0.72). Again, this result can be explained by the location
of jop. In fact, the operation point of
the triple-junction PV–EC device lies at a less critical position
(near the MPP of the PV–EC device) compared to that of the
a-Si:H/a-Si:H tandem PV–EC device (see Figure 3b). Hence, the higher photovoltage (approximately
2.3 V, see Table S1) of a-Si:H/a-Si:H/μc-Si:H
indirectly contributed to the higher stability of the PV–EC
device, as it shifted the operation point more in the direction of
the MPP (away from the steep slope), at which the degradation of FF
has approximately the same effect as that in the PV device.

For the quadruple-based PV–EC device, which provided the
highest photovoltage among the investigated devices (approximately
2.8 V, see Table S1), the PV–EC
degradation was less pronounced compared with PV degradation (see Table 1). As can be seen
in Figure 3b, the reduction
in the FF of the quadruple-based device after light soaking did not
affect the operation point of the PV–EC device significantly.
The high photovoltage of the quadruple device shifted its jop to an uncritical position in the j–V curve (in the “current
plateau” region, where the slope of the j–V curve is nearly equal to 0), which after light soaking
by the photocathode still lies in this region. As already mentioned,
in the PV configuration, degradation of FF affects the MPP and thus
the conversion efficiency of the solar cell, irrespective of its position.
This example therefore proves that a high photovoltage provided by
a solar cell clearly contributes to a higher stability against LID
in the PV–EC case just by shifting the j–V curve toward more positive potentials such that jop lies in the current plateau region before
and after LID.

Although
the operation point of the a-Si:H/μc-Si:H/μc-Si:H PV–EC
device lies in the same critical region as that of the tandem PV–EC
device (see Figure 3b), this device showed the best stability against LID among all other
devices in the PV–EC configuration (see Table 1). Hence, for this specific example, the
argument of favorable jop position due
to a high photovoltage cannot be applied directly. The impressive
stability against LID in the PV–EC and PV configurations originates
from the very stable FF and thus from the very stable jop and MPP values (Vmpp and Jmpp in Table S1).

3 Experimental Section
The solar cells were characterized
by j–V measurements performed
under illumination with a double
source sun simulator from Wacom (WXS-140S-super; Wacom Electric Co.,
Ltd., 541 Tanaka, Fukaya-Shi, Saitama, Japan) under standard test
conditions (class A spectrum, 100 mW/cm2, 25 °C).
LID of the solar cells was performed at 55 °C under open-circuit
conditions, using metal halide lamps with an intensity of 100 mW/cm2 (class B spectrum).

PEC experiments were performed
employing an in-house-designed PEC
cell consisting of a poly(tetrafluoroethylene) cell body on which
the working electrode (functionalized solar cell) was mounted with
a flange. A solar-cell area of 0.5 cm2 was illuminated
through an aperture, using an Oriel LCS-100 solar simulator (Newport
Spectra-Physics GmbH, Darmstadt, Germany), providing a simulated AM
1.5G spectrum (100 mW/cm2). An O-ring (8 mm in diameter)
defined the geometric contact area of the integrated HER catalyst
with the electrolyte (see Figure 1). As the HER catalyst, we chose a 100 nm thick thermally
evaporated Pt layer.17,18 The counter electrode was made
of a Ti sheet coated with RuO2 (12 g Ru/m2;
Metakem GmbH, Usingen, Germany). The distance between the working
and counter electrodes was 2 cm. The employed electrolyte was a 0.1
M KOH solution, which was prepared with ultrapure deionized water
(Millipore, Schwalbach, Germany) and analytical-grade chemicals.

4 Conclusions
In summary, this study investigated the
impact of LID on the performance
of thin-film silicon-based PV–EC devices for water splitting
and revealed the main differences with the degradation behavior of
pure PV devices upon LID. For the PV–EC devices, the location
of the operation point before and after LID is crucial in particular;
in contrast, for the PV devices, only the impact on the MPP is important.
It was shown that all tested
PV–EC devices except for the tandem-based device showed stabilities
against LID that were the same as or higher than those of pure PV
cells. These findings could be explained by linking the photovoltages
of the solar cells with the degradation of the PV parameters upon
LID, in particular FF. At high photovoltages
(above 2.3 V) degradation of FF affected the performance of the PV–EC
devices equally or less than it affected the performance of PV devices.
For photovoltages below 2.3 V, the effect of LID (mostly FF degradation)
was more detrimental in the PV–EC case than that in the PV
case, mainly because the photovoltage was not high enough to shift
the operation point of the PV–EC device close to or above the
MPP of the PV–EC device curve, at which the degradation of
FF is less pronounced. The highest stability against LID was achieved
by the a-Si:H/μc-Si:H/μc-Si:H device, which could be explained
by an impressively stable FF value upon LID and thus very stable jop and MPP values.

Finally, it should
also be mentioned that compared to the very
small reduction in performance for the quadruple- and a-Si:H/μc-Si:H/μc-Si:H-based
PV–EC devices, any degradation due to electrochemical corrosion
of the electrodes imposes a much more critical technical challenge,
as it can very abruptly degrade and destroy the photoelectrode. In
the literature, the typical electrochemical durabilites of silicon-based
PEC devices are in the range of less than 100 h.19,20 On the other hand, for the a-Si:H/a-Si:H- and a-Si:H/a-Si:H/μc-Si:H-based
PV–EC devices, the impact of LID needs to be taken into account,
also in the PV–EC configuration. Alternatively, for future
applications, the development routes of these two device types could
be adapted such that the degraded (or stabilized) performance rather
than the initial performance (presented in this study) is optimized,
that is, such that their sensitivity to degradation is less pronounced.
In
any case, the conclusions drawn from this study can be used as guidelines
for the design of photovoltaic devices particularly tailored for PEC
applications, with high stabilities and efficiencies.
