We
reported the preparation of porous cellulose particles by the
solvent-releasing method, in which a solution of cellulose, dissolved
in 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride and N,N′-dimethylformamide, was dropped into a large amount
of 1-butanol using a syringe. The obtained particles had a high specific
area because of their porous structure. Herein, to functionalize the
cellulose particles, carboxylate groups are introduced into their
porous structure by 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl-mediated
oxidation and ion exchange of carboxylate groups to Ag cations is
conducted. Composite cellulose/Ag particles were synthesized by the
reduction reaction using the carboxylate groups as a scaffold without
free silver nanoparticles in the medium. The obtained composite particles
exhibited a high catalytic ability, which was evaluated by examining
the reduction of 4-nitrophenol. Moreover, we determined that the catalytic
efficiency was maintained for at least three cycles by immobilizing
Ag on cellulose particles.

Introduction
Metal nanoparticles have attracted considerable
attention owing
to their broad range of applications in areas such as electronics,
optics,1,2 catalysis,3 biomedicine,3 and sensors.4,5 Moreover, silver
nanoparticles (AgNPs) have been utilized in antibacterial,6,7 catalytic,8,9 and electronic10 applications. However, metal nanoparticles, including AgNPs,
are generally unstable owing to their large surface area; thus, they
tend to aggregate in a medium, which significantly decreases their
catalytic activity. Therefore, the addition of a surfactant (stabilizer)11−13 or surface modification14 of metal nanoparticles
is generally required to prevent self-aggregation. The immobilization
and encapsulation of metal nanoparticles with polymer matrices, including
polymer particles,15−20 micelles,21 and hydrogels,22 have been reported as possible methods to prevent
aggregation using the polymer’s high tunability. However, because
of their small diameters, which are in the nano and micrometer range,
isolating these composite polymer/AgNP catalysts form the reduction-reaction
system is complicated.17−19,21 Most composites containing
AgNPs were synthesized in the presence of polymer matrices, in which
a large amount of free AgNPs should be synthesized in the medium.
Furthermore, catalytic-performance tests were performed only once
in most of the previous studies.

Cellulose is the most abundant
natural polymer on Earth and exhibits
many attractive properties such as thermal and chemical stability,
nontoxicity, and biocompatibility.23 Thus,
cellulose is extensively used to produce industrial materials such
as pulps, regenerated fibers, and membranes.24 Recently, cellulose particles have been recognized as functional
materials25 that can be used in multiple
applications such as removers for organic substances or metals,26,27 column-packing materials for biochromatography,28 or supports for protein immobilization25 owing to their interesting characteristics including a
low nonspecific adsorption of proteins29 and the availability for surface modification,30,31 in addition to the abovementioned properties. Therefore, cellulose
particles have considerable potential for use as matrices of metal
nanoparticles. However, because cellulose is insoluble in water and
in most organic solvents because of the formation of a hydrogen bonding
network, its dissolution usually requires multistep processes or drastic
conditions.32 Xu et al. reported that AgNPs
were successfully synthesized on porous cellulose particles by hydrothermal
reduction, in which the cellulose microspheres played the role of
a reducing agent for Ag ions, limiting the reduction site only on
the cellulose microspheres.20 However,
the dissolution of cellulose still required drastic conditions.

In 2002, Rogers et al. reported that ionic liquids (ILs), such
as 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride ([Bmim]Cl), could dissolve
cellulose under mild heating conditions.33 Since then, ILs have attracted considerable interest as solvents
for cellulose.10,34,35

We previously reported preparing porous cellulose particles
by
the solvent-releasing method (SRM)36,37 using a [Bmim]Cl
solution of cellulose.38 The obtained particles
exhibited a high specific surface area,39−41 which makes them promising
for functional materials applications after modifying their surface.
Furthermore, millimeter-sized cellulose particles having a high specific
surface area were obtained using a similar method. Owing to their
size, the millimeter-sized cellulose particles are easy to handle,
and have considerable potential for recyclable scaffolds for catalysis.

In this study, we introduced carboxylate groups into the porous
cellulose particles by 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl (TEMPO)-mediated
oxidation,42 which enabled us to selectively
convert the hydroxyl groups at the C6 position of the surface of the
cellulose microfibrils into carboxylate groups.43−46 AgNPs were efficiently synthesized
on the porous structures using the carboxylate groups as a scaffold
without free AgNPs in the medium. Moreover, we evaluated the catalytic
performance and catalyst-recycling ability of the composite cellulose/Ag
particles by examining the reduction of 4-nitrophenol (4-NP) to 4-aminophenol
(4-AP).

Results and Discussion
TEMPO-Mediated Oxidation of Porous Cellulose
Particles
The cellulose particles were oxidized by a TEMPO-mediated
reaction
in which the hydroxyl groups at the C6 position of cellulose can be
selectively converted to carboxyl groups. Figure 1 shows images of the wet cellulose particles
and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the cross sections
of the freeze-dried samples before and after TEMPO oxidation. The
cellulose particles had a spherical shape and a porous structure (Figure 1a,a′), which
were maintained even after the oxidation (Figure 1b,b′). The specific surface area was
105.3 m2/g, which was determined using the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) method.

Figure 1 Images of cellulose particles (a,b) and SEM images of
the cross
sections of freeze-dried cellulose particles (a′,b′)
before (a,a′) and after (b′,b′) TEMPO-mediated
oxidation.

Fourier transform infrared (FTIR)
measurements were performed to
confirm the presence of carboxyl groups in the oxidized cellulose
particles. Figure 2 shows the FTIR spectra of the samples before and after oxidation.
The oxidized cellulose particles exhibited an absorption band at 1620
cm–1, which can be attributed to the carboxylate
ion and was not present in the spectrum of the untreated particles.
This indicates that the oxidized cellulose particles contained carboxyl
groups, which were quantified by electric conductivity titration. Figure 3 shows the relation
between the oxidation time and carboxylate content of the oxidized
cellulose particles. The carboxylate content increased from 0.1 to
0.4 mmol/g-cellulose with the oxidation time during the first 15 min
and then reached a plateau level, indicating that the oxidation reaction
occurred within 15 min. However, for cellulose particles having dense
structures (5.7 m2/g), which were obtained by drying porous
cellulose particles after the preparation, the carboxylate content
was 0.2 mmol/g-cellulose for 3 h. These results indicate that almost
all hydroxyl groups on the surface and within the porous structures
were converted into carboxyl groups.

oxidation.

time.

Preparation of Composite
Cellulose/Ag Particles
To
prepare the composite cellulose/Ag particles, the carboxylated cellulose
particles were dipped in an aqueous AgNO3 solution for
5 h, where the Ag cations were coordinated to the carboxyl groups
on the cellulose particles. The reduction of Ag cations was then conducted
using an aqueous NaBH4 solution. The color of the cellulose
particles changed from colorless to yellow-brown, and the transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) image of the ultrathin cross section indicates
that AgNPs (Dn = 8.6 nm; Cv = 33.2%) were successfully synthesized in them (Figure 4a,d). Furthermore,
the AgNP content on the cellulose particles was determined by thermogravimetric
analysis (TGA). Figure 5 shows the TGA curves for the cellulose and cellulose composite particles.
The analysis was performed in a nitrogen atmosphere considering the
possibility of oxidation of the AgNPs to Ag2O under an
oxygen atmosphere. The amount of AgNPs was determined from the remaining
weight considering the weight loss of cellulose at 900 °C. The
TGA results indicate that 58.5 mg of AgNPs were supported on 1 g of
cellulose particles. However, in the cross section of the obtained
cellulose/Ag particles, the inside of the material remained colorless,
suggesting that AgNPs were produced only at the particle surface (Figure 4b). The TEM images
of the ultrathin cross section show clearly that most of the AgNPs
aggregated near the surface of the composite cellulose particles (Figure 4b,c). These results
can be attributed to the reduction procedure: when the carboxylated
cellulose particles dipped in aqueous AgNO3 were immersed
in the NaBH4 solution, most of the NaBH4 molecules
were consumed to reduce the Ag cations on the surface of the particles
before they could diffuse into the particles.

cellulose/Ag particle (a), cross section

the particle (c,d) after the reduction of Ag cations using an aqueous

Figure 5 Thermal decomposition profiles (under a N2 atmosphere)
of cellulose particles (solid line) and composite cellulose/Ag particles
prepared by the reduction of Ag cations in carboxylated cellulose
particles using NaBH4 (dashed line) and ethanol (dotted
line).

The alcohol reduction method was
applied at 160 °C to synthesize
AgNPs within the porous structures of cellulose particles. The medium
filling in the porous structure of the particles can be changed from
water to alcohol at room temperature before the reduction reaction,41 which made it possible for Ag cations to be
uniformly reduced within the porous structures. After reducing Ag
cations at 160 °C for 2 h, using ethanol as both the reduction
agent and the surrounding medium, the color of the surface and the
cross section of the obtained particles became yellow-brown, whereas
there was no color change in the reaction medium. This behavior indicated
that AgNPs were efficiently synthesized without free AgNPs (Figure 6a–c). Moreover,
the cellulose particles maintained their spherical shape and size,
indicating that the cellulose did not degrade during reduction. The
TEM image of the ultrathin cross section of particles shows that AgNPs
with a much higher contrast were supported on the porous structures
of the obtained particles with lower contrast (Figure 6d). The Dn and Cv of the AgNPs were 9.8 nm and 25.3%, respectively,
which is approximately consistent with the color of the obtained particles
owing to the surface plasmon resonance effect.7,47,48

(a), cross section
of the particle (b), image of the reaction medium (c), and the TEM
image of ultrathin cross section of the particle after the reduction
of Ag cations in ethanol at 160 °C for 2 h.

These results indicate that AgNPs were successfully prepared on
both the surface and within the porous structure of the cellulose
particles. Moreover, from the TGA measurement (Figure 5), 30.8 mg of AgNPs were supported on cellulose
particles (1 g), which agrees well with the theoretical value (i.e.,
39.7 mg per g of cellulose particles) calculated from the amount of
carboxyl in the samples.

Catalytic Properties of the Composite Cellulose/Ag
Particles
The catalytic performance of cellulose/Ag particles
was estimated
by monitoring the reduction of 4-NP to 4-AP in the presence of NaBH4 by UV–visible spectroscopy. In this reaction, 4-NP
was first converted to the 4-NP ion after adding NaBH4,
and then the 4-NP ion is reduced into the 4-AP ion by NaBH4 in the presence of a catalyst.49 When
the reduction reaction occurred after adding the obtained cellulose/Ag
particles as the catalyst, the intensity of the characteristic peak
for the 4-NP ion (at 400 nm) decreased, whereas that of the peak for
the 4-AP ion (at 300 nm) increased (Figure 7). If the concentration of NaBH4 is adjusted to be in large excess compared to the 4-NP concentration,
the reaction should be of the first order with regard to the 4-NP
concentration; therefore, the catalytic rate can be evaluated. Furthermore,
the apparent kinetic rate constant, kapp, is known to be proportional to the total surface area of the AgNPs
because the catalytic reduction reaction proceeds on their surface.20,49 We calculated the rate constant k1,
normalized to S, which is the total surface area
of the AgNPs normalized to the unit volume of the reaction system,
defined by the following equation  where Ct is the concentration
of 4-NP at time t. To
calculate S, the bulk density of silver (ρ
= 10.5 × 103 kg/m3) was used. The amount
of AgNPs was estimated from the TGA results and did not change after
the immobilization reaction and the reduction of 4-NP. Moreover, the
diameter of the AgNPs was determined from the TEM results.

spectra of solution of 4-NP during reduction of 4-NP
using composite cellulose/Ag particles at different time.

Figure 8 shows
the
relation between ln(At/A0) and the reaction time for the cellulose/Ag
particles and cellulose-free AgNPs, where At is the absorbance at the determined given time and A0 is the initial absorbance at t = 0. In both cases, a linear correlation was found between ln(At/A0) and reaction time, indicating that the catalytic reduction proceeded
with first-order kinetics for 4-NP reduction. When composite cellulose/Ag
particles were used as the catalyst in the reaction, kapp and the reaction conversion for 25 min, calculated
from the slope, were 2.83 × 10–2 s–1 and almost 100%, respectively, whereas the value for the cellulose-free
AgNPs were 3.66 × 10–5 s–1 and 6%, respectively, owing to their low specific surface area and
coagulation. These results indicate that the porous cellulose particles
made a great contribution to the improvement of the catalytic efficiency.

of 4-NP using composite cellulose/Ag particles (circles) and cellulose-free
AgNPs (squares); the first (open circles and squares) and second (closed
circles) runs are shown.

Moreover, we compared
the catalytic activities of our materials
to those reported for other systems, as shown in Table 1. The catalytic activity of
the AgNPs in the cellulose particles reported in this work (1.86 ×
10–2 s–1 m–2 L) is comparable to those particles immobilized in cellulose microspheres
(4.42 × 10–2 s–1 m–2 L),20 polystyrene-poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PS-PNIPAm) core–shell microgels (5.02
× 10–2 s–1 m–2 L),18 and PS-poly(acrylic acid) (PS-PAA)
spherical polyelectrolyte brush particles (7.81 × 10–2 s–1 m–2 L),19 and is higher than that of the particles encapsulated in
a bulk polymer hydrogel (7.80 or 7.31 × 10–5 s–1 m–2 L).22

Metal nanoparticle catalysts are generally supported on soluble,
nano or microsized materials, such as dendrimers2 or polymeric microspheres,15,16 for recycling.
In this study, millimeter-sized composite cellulose particles could
be easily isolated from the reaction system. However, when the reduction
was conducted using recycled cellulose/Ag composite particles recovered
after the first reduction, the catalyst activity remarkably decreased
(Figure 8) because
the AgNPs were detached from the cellulose particles during the reaction
and the washing step.

To solve this problem, the AgNPs were
immobilized on the cellulose
particles through Ag–sulfur (Ag–S) bonds, which were
formed by bridging thiol groups to the AgNPs.50 A condensation reaction between the carboxyl groups of the cellulose/Ag
particles and the amine groups of cysteamine was used to introduce
the thiol groups on the cellulose particles and form the required
Ag–S bonds. The obtained immobilized AgNPs/cellulose particles
retained the yellow-brown color, and AgNPs (Dn, 8.6 nm; Cv, 33.2%) supported
on the porous structure were observed in the TEM image of the ultrathin
cross section, although some AgNPs were coagulated (Figure 9). The recycling ability of
the obtained particles was investigated. Figure 10 shows the relation between ln(At/A0) and
the reaction time for immobilized AgNPs/cellulose particles during
three runs. The reaction rate constant (2.75 × 10–5 s–1 m–2 L) of the immobilized
AgNP/cellulose catalyst was lower than that observed with the composite
cellulose/Ag particles during the first run (1.86 × 10–2 s–1 m–2 L). This was caused
by the adsorption of cysteamine molecules on the surface of the AgNPs
during the coupling reaction, leading to a drop in catalytic efficiency.
However, compared with the first run, the catalytic ability of the
AgNP-immobilized particles in the third run was almost the same, and
the conversion of 4-NP was almost the same (approx. 100%) in each
step, indicating that the coupling of Ag–S bonds could prevent
the AgNPs from detaching from the cellulose particles and that the
immobilized AgNPs/cellulose particles exhibit a good recycling ability
when they were used as a catalyst.

Conclusions
We successfully prepared composite cellulose/Ag
particles by introducing
carboxylate groups into the porous structures of cellulose particles,
which were used as a scaffold for synthesizing AgNPs. The catalytic
ability of cellulose/Ag particles for the reduction of 4-NP to 4-AP
was much higher than that of cellulose-free AgNPs. Furthermore, when
AgNPs were immobilized on the cellulose/Ag particles via Ag–S
bonds, the obtained immobilized particles maintained their catalytic
performance during the three cycles. The knowledge obtained in this
study is readily available for preparing other metal nanoparticles
on the cellulose particles, and they can be handled and recycled without
a complicated process. Therefore, the resultant materials have great
potential for catalyst applications. Moreover, for making the preparation
method easy, we have been trying to prepare cellulose composite particles
immobilized metal nanoparticles via one step and will report it in
the future.

Experiment
Materials
Microcrystalline cellulose
(powder, derived
from cotton linter, Mn; 3.0 × 104, particles size; 51 μm), [Bmim]Cl, TEMPO, and cysteamine
were used as-received from Aldrich Chemical Co., Ltd. N,N-Dimethylformamide (DMF), 1-butanol, ethanol,
a phosphate pH standard equimolal solution (pH 6.86 at 25 °C),
a sodium hypochlorite (NaClO) solution, sodium chlorite (NaClO2), hydrochloric acid, sodium hydrate (NaOH), silver nitrate
(AgNO3), sodium borohydride, 4-NP, and N,N′-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC) were used
as-received from Nacalai Tesque Inc. (Kyoto, Japan). N-Hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) was used as-received from Tokyo Chemical
Industry Co., Ltd. The water used in the experiments was purified
using an ErixUV (Millipore, Japan) purification system and had a resistivity
of 18.2 MΩ cm.

Preparation of Millimeter-Sized Cellulose
Particles by SRM
Millimeter-sized cellulose particles were
prepared by SRM, according
to our previous reports.38,41 Microcrystalline cellulose
powder was dissolved in [Bmim]Cl at a weight ratio of 7:43 upon heating
at 100 °C for 7 h. DMF was added as a cosolvent to reduce the
viscosity of the solution. This cellulose–[Bmim]Cl–DMF
(7/43/50, w/w/w) (8.57 g) mixture was then dropped into a large amount
of 1-butanol (ca. 100 mL) under stirring (using a syringe) to remove
the [Bmim]Cl and DMF from the drops. The cellulose present in the
solution immediately precipitated in the form of cellulose particles,
which were washed three times with 1-butanol and twice with water
to remove any remaining impurities. The cellulose particles were stirred
for 2 h between each washing step. The original microcrystalline cellulose
had a cellulose I type crystal. However, the particles prepared by
SRM changed the crystal structure to cellulose II type with very small
crystals.39

TEMPO-Mediated Oxidation
of Porous Cellulose Particles
TEMPO-mediated oxidation was
conducted according to the following
procedure: TEMPO (3 mg) and NaClO2 (22 mg) were dissolved
in a phosphate pH standard equimolar solution (10 mL, pH 6.86 at 25
°C). Then, a NaClO solution (7.5 wt %, 10 mL; diluted in a standard
buffer solution) was added into the mixture, and the cellulose particles
(80 mg) were immersed in this solution for 1 h upon stirring. Oxidation
was performed by stirring the mixture at 60 °C in a 50 mL flask,
and the obtained carboxylated cellulose particles were thoroughly
washed with water.

Preparation of Composite Cellulose/Ag Particles
The
carboxylated cellulose particles (80 mg) were immersed in aqueous
AgNO3 solution (40 mL, 6.4 mM) for 5 h at room temperature
upon stirring. The obtained particles were washed with water twice
over 2 h to remove the free Ag cations. Reduction of the Ag cations
was performed for 2 h using either aqueous NaBH4 solution
at room temperature in a glass bottle or ethanol at 160 °C in
an autoclave. The obtained cellulose/Ag particles were thoroughly
washed with water to remove the free Ag cations and AgNPs.

For
immobilizing the as-prepared AgNPs on the cellulose particles for
improving the recyclable catalytic performance, the immobilization
through covalent bonds was achieved as follows: the obtained cellulose/Ag
particles (35 mg) were first dispersed in a DMF (10.0 g) medium containing
dissolved DCC (26.9 mg), NHS (14.9 mg), and cysteamine (1.2 mg) and
then stirred at room temperature for 2 h. The obtained cellulose/Ag
particles were thoroughly washed with DMF and preserved in water.

Estimation of the Catalytic Performance of AgNPs in the Composite
Cellulose Particles
The catalytic efficiencies of the composite
cellulose particles were evaluated using the reduction of 4-NP to
4-AP in the presence of NaBH4 as a model reaction. The
AgNPs were used as catalysts. In the experiments, NaBH4 (90.8 mg) was first added to an aqueous 4-NP solution (40 mL, 0.06
mM); furthermore, a part of the obtained mixture (4 g) was poured
into a quartz cuvette, and the composite particles (3.5 mg) were dispersed
in it. The reduction reaction occurred in the quartz cuvette and was
monitored at fixed time intervals by UV–visible spectroscopy
(UV-2500 UV–vis spectrophotometer, Shimadzu Corp., Kyoto, Japan).

Characterization
The cellulose particles were immersed
in liquid nitrogen, freeze-dried in a freeze-dryer (FDU-1200, Tokyo
Rikakikai Co., Ltd.; Tokyo, Japan), and observed using a scanning
electron microscope (JSM-6510, JEOL, Tokyo, Japan) at an accelerating
voltage of 20 kV after platinum coating. To analyze their inner morphology,
ultrathin (100 nm-thick) cross sections of the particles were prepared
using a cryomicrotome (Leica EM UC6 equipped with EM FC7). The sliced
samples were then observed using a transmission electron microscope
(JEM-1230, JEOL, Tokyo, Japan). The number-average diameter (Dn) and the coefficient of variation (Cv) was estimated from 200 AgNPs on the TEM images
using image analysis (WinRoof, Mitani Co., Ltd., Japan). Nitrogen
adsorption measurements were performed using a Quantachrome NOVA 3200e
instrument (USA). BET specific surface area of the cellulose particles
was assessed from the adsorption branch of the isotherm for a relative
pressure of 0.05–0.3 at 77 K.

The products were qualitatively
analyzed using a FTIR spectrometer (FT-IR, FT/IR-6200, JASCO, Tokyo,
Japan) and the pressed KBr pellet technique. The electric conductivity
titration method was applied to quantify the amount of carboxylate
in the cellulose particles.51 Briefly,
dried cellulose particles (80 mg) were immersed in hydrochloric acid
(15 mL, 0.01 M) and disintegrated into a well-dispersed slurry by
ultrasonication. Furthermore, aqueous NaOH solution (0.01 M) was added
to the mixture at a rate of 0.4 mL/min while monitoring the electric
conductivity of the system using a conductance meter (F-74, HORIBA
Corp., Kyoto, Japan).

The amount of AgNPs supported on the cellulose
particles was measured
using a thermogravimetric analyzer (EXSTAR TG/DTA6200, SII Nano Technology
Inc., Japan) at a heating rate of 10 °C/min from 30 to 900 °C
under a nitrogen atmosphere.
