Amide-functionalized materials have
emerged as promising nonprecious
catalysts for electrochemical sensing and catalysis. The covalent
immobilization of chitosan (CS) onto graphene sheet (GS) (denoted
as CS–GS) has been done via higher degree of amidation reaction
to develop an electrochemical sensing matrix for simultaneous determination
of dopamine (DA) and uric acid (UA). The enhanced amidation between
CS and GS has not been reported previously. However, electrochemical
results have revealed that the CS–GS enhances the electrocatalytic
performance in terms of the oxidation potential and peak current due
to the higher degree of amide functionalization compared to that of
CS/GS, which has a lower amidation. Differential pulse voltammetry-based
studies have indicated that the CS–GS matrix works at a lower
detection limit (0.14 and 0.17 μM) (S/N = 3) and over a longer
linear range (1–700 and 1–800 μM), with a comparatively
higher sensitivity (2.5 and 2.0 μA μM–1 cm–2), for DA and UA, respectively. In addition,
the CS–GS matrix demonstrates good selectivity toward the detection
of DA and UA in the presence of a 10-fold higher concentration of
AA and glucose. The as-prepared three-dimensional porous CS–GS
also endows selective determination toward DA and UA in various real
samples.

==== Body
Introduction
Dopamine (DA) and uric
acid (UA) are important biospecies that
play significant roles in the physiological function of metabolism,
the central nervous system, and the circulatory system of the human
body. Deficiency or maladjustment in their levels may lead to many
diseases, such as cancer, Parkinson’s disease, and hyperuricemia.1−4 Therefore, simultaneous determination
of DA and UA is of critical importance for developing nerve physiology,
making diagnoses, and controlling medicine. However, conventional
electrodes normally result in poor selectivity and low reproducibility.
Moreover, accurate determination
of DA and UA often proves difficult due to the concentration of ascorbic
acid (AA) being at a millimolar level in the human body and their
capability of oxidation at a similar potential to that of the bare
electrode.5,6 Because of the high concentration of AA
in the humoral fluids, the development of a simple and rapid method
for the determination of much lower concentrations of DA and UA (being
in lower concentrations in humoral fluids than those of AA) with a
high sensitivity and selectivity is desirable for diagnostic applications.
For overcoming these shortcomings, various carbon-based materials
have been proposed as electrode modifiers;7−12 unfortunately, most of them are limited by a narrow linear range
and failure to detect at a high level.7−12 Among them, nitrogen (N)-rich porus materials are viewed as one
of the promising electrode materials.12

Graphene oxide (GO)13 is the oxidized
and exfoliated sheet of an sp2-hybridized graphene sheet
(GS) that carries various oxygenated groups, such as epoxide, hydroxyl,
carbonyl, and carboxyl. Among all of the oxygenated groups, the carboxyl
group of GO is the most suitable site for reacting with an amine group
to form an amide bond through the condensation reaction.14−17 However, GS itself has zero band gap, a fact that poses a considerable
barrier to its application in digital electronic devices, such as
semiconductors, sensors, and electrocatalysts.14 Several approaches, including implanting heteroatoms (e.g.,
N atoms) into a GS plane, have been applied to overcome this disadvantage.14,18,19 The N atom is considered the
best candidate among various heteroatoms (i.e., B, S, P, and O) for
carbon substitution because of its five valence electrons that are
capable of strong interactions with adjacent carbon atoms.

N
functionalization creates a net positive charge on adjacent carbon
atoms in the GS lattice to facilitate electrocatalysis by attracting
electrons from the anodic reaction. This phenomenon has been proven
through quantum mechanics calculations and subsequent experimental
observations.9,12,20−22 Also, an sp3-carbon-rich polymer matrix
might influence the electrocatalytic behavior of sp2-carbon-rich
GS because of its effective charge polarization, as reported by Tao
et al.23

Chitosan (CS) with sp3 carbon is a natural polysaccharide
polymer that has attracted significant attention due to its excellent
biological compatibility, good hydrophilicity, and film-forming ability.24 However, due to its relatively poor conductivity,
CS is often associated with conductive materials, such as carbon materials
and metal nanomaterials, to form composite film for immobilization.21 However, −NH2 group is among
the many functional groups in CS that could be easily applied in chemical
modification (i.e., covalent functionalization) with −COOH
via the amidation reaction.21,24 In the meantime, many
researchers have made nanocomposites with GS and CS via amidation.24−28 However, unfortunately, the abundance of amidation may be hampered
in those nanocomposites due to the lower amount of the −COOH
group in GO (compared to that in other groups) normally.29−33 Therefore, to overcome this shortcoming, GO needs special chemical
pretreatment to increase the amount of −COOH on its surface
to increase the degree of amidation between GS and CS.

In this
article, we explore for the first time the utilization
of an enhanced amidation reaction between CS and GS for preparing
a potential electrocatalyst for the detection of DA and UA. However,
CS was immobilized with GS (CS–GS) to construct a three-dimensional
(3D) porous structured interface through a covalent amidation reaction
(Scheme 1). As a result,
this film showed notable effects on simultaneous electrocatalytic
detection of DA and UA in the presence of high concentrations of AA
and glucose within a long linear range.

Results and Discussion
Instrumental Characterization
The
surface morphology
of CS–GS and CS/GS was observed using the scanning electron
microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) techniques,
and both consisted of a filmlike structure plane, as shown in Figure 1. The SEM image of
CS/GS (Figure 1a) shows
a wrinkled and sheetlike structure of GS films and smooth and comparatively
thick CS films on GS. The SEM image of CS–GS (Figure 1b) shows randomly distributed,
considerably higher crumpled structures within the synthesized CS–GS.
These crumpled structures were due to the attachment of a N atom to
the GS lattice as a result of the covalent functionalization via amidation.34 The crumpled CS–GS films effectively
prevented the aggregation of graphitic sheets. Similarly, the TEM
image of CS/GS (Figure 1c) shows an aggregated structure of CS on GS and an inhomogeneous
thickness of the CS/GS film. The TEM image of CS–GS (Figure 1d) shows a random
distribution of a considerably crumpled structure with a large amount
of wrinkles and a multilayered structure due to covalent functionalization
through amidation.35,36 The substantially crumpled CS–GS
films were interconnected with one another to form a porous structure,
which contributed to the enhancement of the electromechanical and
mechanical properties.37,38 However, high-resolution TEM
images were also recorded and they showed that CS coexisted on the
GS film in CS/GS (Figure 1c, inset). On the other hand, both CS and GS were embedded
on each other to form a porous structure in the CS–GS (Figure 1d, inset). N elemental
mapping revealed that N was distributed homogeneously in the CS–GS
sample but not in the CS/GS sample (inset of the corresponding figures),
which also proved better homogeneous film formation in CS–GS.
For comparison, bare GS and CS
films were analyzed through TEM (Figures S1a and 2b), which showed a slightly wrinkled sheetlike structure and
a comparatively thin filmlike structure for GS and CS film, respectively.
The average size of the three samples was measured to be 720, 690,
and 480 nm for GS, CS/GS, and CS–GS, respectively (Figure S1c). The size of CS–GS was significantly
reduced, which is an indication of an increased edge; thus, a huge
−COOH group was placed at the edge of GO during conversion
from GO to GO–COOH.

Figure 1 SEM (a, b) and TEM (c, d) images of CS/GS and
CS–GS; insets:
HRTEM images of CS–GS and CS/GS, with their N element mapping.

Figure 2a shows
the results of N2 absorption/desorption analysis to characterize
porous structure of the as-prepared CS–GS and CS/GS samples.
On the basis of the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method,
the specific surface area (SSA) of CS–GS and CS/GS samples
was found to be 381.3 and 102.8 m2 g–1, respectively. The SSA is an important parameter to understand the
electrochemical properties of CS–GS and CS/GS.39 However, the porous CS–GS had 3.7 times higher SSA
than the nonfunctionalized CS/GS, thereby confirming the hierarchical
3D porous structure of the CS–GS sample. This finding agreed
well with the morphological analysis through SEM.

Figure 2 BET surface area calculated
from nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms of
CS–GS and CS/GS (a), and XRD patterns of GS, CS–GS,
CS/GS, and CS (b).

The XRD patterns of CS,
GS, CS–GS, and CS/GS are shown in Figure 2b. In the GS XRD
pattern, the diffraction peaks appearing at ∼25.5 and 41.3°
could be ascribed to the (002) and (100) planes of the graphitic carbon
(ICSD ref 98-005-2230), suggesting that the GO has been reduced to
GS.40 In the CS pattern, the diffraction
peak appearing at ∼20.6° in the XRD pattern can be ascribed
to the (200) plane of CS.41 For the CS–GS
and CS/GS samples, the diffraction peaks for the (002) plane appeared
at 23.6 and 23.5°, respectively, which indicates that the CS–GS
matrix was better ordered, with the absence of free nanosheets in
this sample, and vice versa.42,43 In addition, the better
covalent functionalization between CS and GS was verified by the disappearance
of the CS characteristic diffraction peak in the CS–GS XRD
pattern, whereas the characteristic peaks of both CS and GS appeared
in the CS/GS XRD pattern (Figure S1b).

Details of the chemical structure and bonding state changes during
various reactions were elucidated through X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS) analysis. First, we observed the conversion reaction of GO to
GO–COOH, and the XPS survey spectra of GO and GO–COOH
are shown in Figure 3a. Both XPS survey spectra exhibit several distinct peaks at approximately
285.6 and 533.4 eV, which were attributed to the C and O elements,
respectively.44,45 The C/O atomic ratio was similar
for both the GO (1.95) and GO–COOH (2.01) samples. The high-resolution
C1s XPS spectra of all aforementioned samples were recorded (Figure 3b), and they showed
the defective sp3-carbon along with the basal-plane sp2-carbon of the graphitic structure.34,46 The C1s spectrum of GO in Figure 3b shows four absorbance peaks of oxygenated sp3-C at 286.6, 287.8, and 289.4 eV, which were attributed to
C–O, C=O, and O–C=O, respectively, and
a distinct oxygen-free sp2-C (C=C) at 285.0 eV.47,48 Compared with GO, the GO–COOH sample showed a stronger absorbance
peak for O–C=O and a comparatively weaker absorbance
peak for C=O. This observation indicates that conversion to
the carboxyl group on the GO–COOH sheets was successful. Schematic
diagrams of GO and GO–COOH are presented in the corresponding
figure insets.

Figure 3 XPS spectra (a) and core-level C1s XPS spectra (b) of
GO and
GO–COOH; core-level C1s XPS spectra of GS, CS, CS–GS,
and CS/GS (c); and core-level N1s XPS spectra of CS, CS–GS,
and CS/GS (d).

Afterward, the amidation
between CS and GO–COOH was elucidated
further through the XPS analysis. Figure 3c shows the core-level of C1s XPS spectra
of GS, CS, CS–GS, and CS/GS. By comparison, all of the above-mentioned
samples showed a stronger suppression for the oxygen-containing components
of their C1s XPS spectra than that by the GO and/or GO–COOH
samples. These results indicate an efficient reduction of the oxygen-containing
functional groups by NaBH4 (for GS) and CS (for CS–GS
and CS/GS), although CS itself is a good reductant, as reported earlier.26 However, the intensity of the O–C=O
peak was reduced significantly by up to 1.22% in the CS–GS
sample relative to that in the CS/GS sample (3.9%), probably because
of the CS grafting via amide functionalization. Importantly, it was
observed that
the C–O peak intensity in CS–GS was significantly stronger
than that in the GS and CS/GS samples, probably because of the influence
of the C–N bond over the C–O bond in the CS–GS
sample.49,50 Similarly, a strong C–O peak intensity
was observed in the CS sample, while it also contents huge C–O
bond along with C–N bond. This scenario indicated a higher
degree
of amidation between GS and CS in CS–GS than that in the CS/GS
sample.

Figure 3d shows
the N1s XPS spectra of bare CS, CS–GS, and CS/GS with two absorbance
peaks. For CS, the absorbance peaks at 401.0 and 398.5 eV were attributed
to the −NH2 and C–N bonds, respectively,51,52 and these were positively shifted at 401.05 and 398.7 eV, respectively,
for the CS–GS sample. After amidation, the C–N peak
intensity increased substantially up to 89.5% (for CS–GS) from
52.7% (for CS), thereby confirming again the superior amide functionalization
between GS and CS in the CS–GS sample (Figure 1). However, we found that a lower
degree of amidation between GS and CS occurred spontaneously in the
CS/GS (peak intensity was 66.3%), as reported without 1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-3-ethylcarbodiimide
(EDC)/N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) treatment in the
previous literature.24−28 Therefore, CS is grafted into GS through the enhanced amidation
reaction to form the N-rich CS–GS matrix.

Further covalent
functionalization was characterized by the FTIR
spectra (Figure S2). The spectrum of GO
displayed several characteristic peaks, such as those for the C=O
group at 1722 cm–1, C=C group at 1622 cm–1, and C–O group at 1035 cm–1. These results are consistent with the reported values.15,31 All of the mentioned peaks were observed in the GO–COOH spectrum.
Significantly, the C=O peak intensity was increased compared
to that in the GO spectrum, which indicated −COOH formation
on the GO sheet. Compared to those of the oxygen functional groups
in the GO and GO–COOH, the signals of the oxygen functional
groups in CS–GS and GS were very weak, indicating the presence
of less oxygeneous functional groups attached to the surface. For
CS–GS, the peak at 1199 cm–1 was attributed
to the C–N group.15 These results
also confirm the conversion of GO to GO–COOH and the subsequent
enhancement of amidation between CS and GS.

Electrochemical Measurements
The vital interfacial
properties of the modified electrodes, such as electrical conductivity
and electrocatalytic features, were first analyzed by cyclic voltammetry
(CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements.
Both the experiments were carried out in argon (Ar)-saturated 0.1
M KCl containing 5 mM [Fe(CN)6]3–/4– redox probe, and the EIS was done within the frequency of 105–10–2 Hz, as shown in Figure 4. Figure 4a shows the CVs of bare GCE, CS/GS, and CS–GS.
As can be seen, the redox peak current of [Fe(CN)6]3–/4– from CS–GS was 4 and 2 times larger
than that from the GCE and CS/GS. Briefly, the CV indicated that the
bare GCE impeded the electron transfer of [Fe(CN)6]3–/4– due to its lower conductivity. Compared
with bare GCE, CS/GS displayed a higher redox peak current because
the introduction of conductive GS led to an increase in the redox
probe on the electrode surface. However, the peak separation (ΔEp = Epa – Epa) was much higher (ΔEp = 0.24 V) than that of bare GCE (ΔEp = 0.08 V), probably due to the presence of free CS nanosheets
with a lower degree of amidation, which allows staying CS/GS interface
with negatively charged3 while higher intensity
of O–C=O was observed from C1s XPS spectrum. A higher
redox peak current and smaller peak
separation (ΔEp = 0.057 V) of [Fe(CN)6]3–/4– were then observed on the
CS–GS-modified electrode, indicating faster electron transfer
behavior, probably due to the large active SSA with a positively charged
interface originating from a higher degree of amidation; as a result,
the electron transfer between Fe(CN)63–/4– and CS–GS was accelerated.

Figure 4 CVs at 50 mV s–1 (a)
and Nyquist plots from 105 to 10–2 Hz
frequencies (b) on bare GCE,
CS/GS/GCE, and CS–GS/GCE in an Ar-saturated 0.1 M KCl solution
containing 5.0 mM Fe(CN)63–/4–.

The electron transfer characteristics were interpreted using
Randle’s
circuit in the EIS experiment in Figure 4b. Randle’s circuit consists of electrolyte
resistance (Rs), electron-transfer resistance
(Rct), double-layer capacitance (Cdl), and Warburg impedance (W) (Figure 4b, inset).
The Nyquist plot includes a semicircular portion and a linear portion;
the semicircular portion corresponds to the electron transfer limited
process, and the linear part corresponds to the diffusion process
at higher and lower frequencies. The semicircle diameters correspond
to the Rct.53 As can be seen, the Nyquist plot of bare GCE displayed a well-defined,
enlarged semicircle, with an Rct of about
855 Ω at a high frequency. Compared to that from bare GCE, the
diameter of the semicircle in the Nyquist plot from CS/GS was decreased,
with an Rct of 788 Ω. However, the
smallest semicircle in the Nyquist
plot was observed for CS–GS, with the lowest Rct of 260 Ω, which is 3 times lower than that of
the CS/GS. The superior conductivity is probably due to the presence
of N in the CS–GS matrix.54 Also,
the porous structure with a higher SSA may enhance the conductivity
because of better chemisorption of the redox probe onto the CS–GS
surface.55 Interestingly, the Z″ value increased with a 30° angle in the bare GCE curve
but increased with a 20° angle in the CS/GS plot, indicating
that the diffusion process was probably weak at the CS/GS-modified
electrode. On the other hand, the Z″ value
increased much more strongly with a higher
angle, 60°, at the CS–GS-modified electrode, indicating
that the diffusion process was much better at the CS–GS-modified
electrode. These results indicate that CS–GS could act as a
conductive surface to promote faster electron transfer.

Electrochemical
Sensing of DA and UA
To probe the potential
application of CS/CS and CS–GS, the modified electrodes were
utilized for the simultaneous detection of DA and UA by CVs in Ar-saturated
0.1 M phosphate buffered saline (PBS) (pH 7.4) at a 50 mV s–1 scan rate, as shown in Figure 5. Figure 5a depicts the CVs on bare GCE of 0.1 M PBS in the presence of 0.5
mM DA, UA, and a mixture of DA and UA (DA + UA). As can be seen, the
oxidation and reduction peak potentials (Epa and Epc, respectively) appeared in the
DA curve (0.20 and 0.12 V) and only an oxidation peak appeared in
the UA curve (Epa = 0.29 V). These peaks
appeared with a variation in peak current and potential in the mixed
solution, indicating an irregular detection of DA (Epa = 0.29 V and Epc = 0.07
V) and UA (Epa = 0.49 V) in bare GCE.
This was due to the sluggish electron transfer kinetics at the bare
GCE that occurred because of weak conductivity and electrode fouling
caused by the deposition of DA and UA and their oxidative products
on the electrode surface.56 According to Figure 5b, the Epa and Epc peaks (0.25 and
0.13 V, respectively) appeared in the presence of DA, with an improved
current intensity at the CS/GS-modified GCE. In the UA curve, only
the oxidation peak appeared at 0.33 V, with a better peak current
intensity. In mixed solution, however, all of the peaks appeared at
approximately the same position, signifying the presence of DA and
UA, but the UA peak was unrecognizable and the current intensity was
weaker in the mixed solution compared to those in the UA only solution.
Moreover, the background current was much stronger than that in bare
GCE. These results suggest that still sluggish electron transfer kinetics
and fouling occur at the CS/GS/GCE. However, well-defined and sharp
oxidation peaks of DA (Epa = 0.17 V) and
UA (Epa = 0.14 V) at CS–GS/GCE
were observed due to the presence of DA and UA in the solo solution
(Figure 5c). The peak
currents for these two molecules were also higher than those for other
electrodes. The cathodic peak of DA appeared at Epc = 0.12 V, suggesting that the reversibility of DA at
the CS–GS/GCE was remarkably improved. All of the above peaks
appeared at approximately same position in a mixed solution of DA
and UA, with approximately the same current intensity and peak sharpness.
The background current was also much lower than that of the CS/GS-modified
electrode, whereas the lower background current leads to less fouling
and improved electrocatalysis.57 This improvement
could be attributed to the higher SSA and better conductivity resulting
from the porous structure and higher degree of covalent amidation
in the CS–GS matrix.

Figure 5 CVs for 0.5 mM DA, 0.5 mM UA, and 0.5 mM DA
+ UA recorded on bare
GCE (a), CS/GS/GCE (b), and CS–GS/GCE (c) in Ar-saturated 0.1
M PBS (pH 7.4) at a 50 mV s–1 scan rate.

Electrochemical Kinetics of DA and UA at
CS–GS
To understand the electrochemical kinetics in
the CS–GS matrix,
we recorded the CVs of 0.5 mM DA and UA on the CS–GS-modified
electrode at various scan rates (ν, mV s–1), as shown in Figure 6. As shown in Figure 6a, the redox peak current of DA enhances gradually with an increase
in the scan rate. The same phenomenon was observed in the CVs of UA,
wherein the irreversible oxidation peak current (Ipa) of UA also enhanced gradually with an increase in
the scan rate (Figure 6b). Meanwhile, the redox peak current (Ipa and Ipc) of DA and the Ipa of UA showed good linear relationships with good correlation
coefficients (R2) as a function of the
square root of scan rate in Figure 6c,d by obeying the following regression equations      These results indicate that all of the electrochemical
reactions of DA and UA on the modified electrode were diffusion-controlled
processes.56,58 Also, Figure 6e,f shows that both Epa and Epc of DA and the Epa of UA are linearly proportional as a function
of ln ν and follow regression equations below      However, an important electrochemical
parameter, the standard electron transfer rate constant (ks), was then calculated according to Laviron’s
equations for DA (eq 1) and UA (eq 2);28 whereas DA is a reversible oxidation process,
UA is an irreversible one. Thus, the value of ks was calculated as 7.95 and 7.44 s–1 for
DA and UA, respectively, which are comparable to those obtained from
other carbon-based sensors,59,60 suggesting that DA
has fast electron transfer kinetics on the developed sensing interface.
These values could remain unchanged with varying pH, as the electron
transfer step of the heterogeneous reaction may not be affected by
pH.61 1   2  where α is the electron transfer coefficient
(0.72); n is the number of electron; F is the Faraday constant (96 485 C mol–1); R and T are the universal gas
constant and temperature (K), respectively; and E°′ is the formal potential.

scan rates on CS–GS/GCE in Ar-saturated
0.1 M PBS at pH 7.4, containing 0.5 mM DA (a) and 0.5 mM UA (b); plots
of peak currents vs square root of scan rate (ν) (c, d); and
peak potential (Ep) vs ln v (e, f).

Optimization of pH for
DA and UA Detection at CS–GS
The pH of the detection
medium can affect the rate of mass transport
to the electrode surface, as in the present study. The effect of pH
on the current response of the CS–GS-modified electrode toward
100 μM DA and UA was investigated separately within the pH range
of 3.0–8.0. Figure 7a,b shows that the Ipa of DA and
UA gradually increased with an increase in the pH up to 7.4, which
is nearly neutral and the pH of humoral fluid. However, further increase
in the pH caused a decrease in Ipa for
DA and UA, probably because the hydroxyl anion prevented the access
of DA or UA to the adsorption sites on the CS–GS/GCE surface.
Plots of Ipa and EPa with respect to the pH value are shown in Figure 7c,d for DA and UA, respectively.
The Ipa of DA and UA increased with an
increase in pH. It reached a maximum at pH 7.4 and then decreased
rapidly with a further increase in pH. In addition, their EPa values shifted toward negative values with
an increase in the pH of 0.1 M PBS. The linear relationships of DA
and UA are expressed as follows    However, the plot of EPa versus pH derived slopes of 59 and 55 mV
pH–1, which are close to the theoretical Nernstian
value of 59 mV pH–1. These results indicate that
an equal number of electrons
and protons took part in the electrode reactions, which is in agreement
with the literature reported.62,63 Therefore, considering
the effect of pH on Ipa, 0.1 M PBS of
pH 7.4 was chosen as the electrolyte for all of the experiments in
this study.

Figure 7 CVs recorded on CS–GS/GCE in Ar-saturated 0.1 M PBS at different
pH values, containing 100 μM DA (a) and 100 μM UA (b),
and plots of the corresponding peak current (c) and peak potential
(d) as the
function of pH value for DA.

Simultaneous Detection of DA and UA at CS–GS
The
differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) technique offers a higher sensitivity
and a better resolution than those of the CV technique
for quantitative analysis because it applies a small voltage pulse
superimposed on the linear voltage sweep and samples the differential
current shortly after the pulse.64 So,
DPV was utilized to evaluate the performance of the CS–GS matrix
for the quantitative determination of DA and UA. Figure 8a shows the DPVs of DA with
increasing amounts from 1 to 700 μM in Ar-saturated 0.1 M PBS
at pH 7.4. The oxidation peaks of DA enhanced gradually
with an increase in the DA concentration (CDA), and Ipa showed a good linear relationship
with the CDA over the range tested (Figure 8b), according to
the regression equation given below  On the basis of the signal-to-noise
(S/N =
3) characteristic, the limit of detection (LOD) was estimated to be
0.14 μM, with a sensitivity of 2.5 μA μM–1 cm–2.

Figure 8 DPVs on CS–GS/GCE at various concentrations
of DA (1–700
μM) (a) and of UA (1–800 μM) (c) in a 0.1 M PBS
solution (pH 7.4); the corresponding plot of Ipa vs CDA (b) and Ipa vs CUA (d); DPV profile
for synergic determination of DA (30–140 μM) with 40
μM UA (e) and UA (10–130 μM) with 40 μM DA
(g); the corresponding plots of Ipa vs CDA (f) and Ipa vs CUA (h).

Similarly, Figure 8c shows the DPV curves with increasing concentration of UA
(CUA) from 1 to 800 μM. The peak
currents
of UA increased linearly with an increase in CUA (Figure 8d), according to the linear function  Also, on the basis of S/N = 3, the LOD was
estimated to be 0.17 μM, with a sensitivity of 2.0 μA
μM–1 cm–2.

Figure 8e shows
the DPV curves for different concentrations of CDA (30–140 μM) in Ar-saturated 0.1 M PBS at pH
7.4 coexisting with 40 μM UA for synergic determination. Both
DA- and UA-signifying peaks were in the same Epa, and the Ipa was proportional
to the CDA (Figure 8f), which suggests that their oxidation products
do not adsorb on the surface of CS–GS/GCE to hinder the synergic
detection of DA and UA. The regression equation of the Ipa versus CDA curve was calculated
as below  Similarly, Figure 8g shows DPV curves with varied CUA from
10 to 130 μM coexisting with 40 μM
DA for synergic determination. The Ipa of UA increased linearly with an increase in CUA (Figure 8h), according to the linear function  Therefore, all of these assays indicate that
the proposed biosensor, CS–GS/GCE, allows synergic and sensitive
detection of DA and UA without significant interference from each
other. Table 1 shows
a comparison of the analytical performance of CS–GS/GCE to
that of other sensors. We can see that the proposed biosensor has
a better performance for the detection of DA and UA particularly over
that of other GS with CS-based biosensors in terms of a long detection
range. This also demonstrates that this biosensor holds great application
prospect for synergic determination of DA and UA.

Interference Studies
One important issue for the feasibility of a biosensor
is its capability to distinguish the analytes selectively from the
interferents. In this work, the electrochemical responses of 100 μM
DA and UA were measured at CS–GS/GCE in the presence of different
interferents. The effects of some bioorganic molecules, such as AA
(10-fold) and glucose (Glu, 10-fold), on the electrochemical responses
of DA and UA were investigated (Figure S3a), and all response variations were lower than 2.5% from the blank
response in 0.1 M PBS (Figure 9a). In addition, the results show that the common inorganic
ions, such as Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+, Zn2+, Cl–, NO3–, and SO42–, in 100-fold
excess do not show interference with DA and UA detection (Figure S3b). These results suggest that this
biosensor has a satisfactory selectivity for the synergic determination
of DA and UA in the presence of various interfering bioorganic and/or
inorganic ions.

of 1 mM glucose (Glu) and AA (a), urine (Ur), and milk (b) in an Ar-saturated
0.1 M PBS solution (pH 7.4).

Real Sample Analysis, Reproducibility, and Stability
Real-time
monitoring of the performance of the fabricated biosensor
was carried out by detecting DA and UA in different real samples [urine
(Ur) and cow milk (Milk)], as shown in Figure S3c. The results are shown in Figure 9b and Table 2. The recoveries were in the range of 99.05–101.6%,
suggesting good feasibility and reliability of the proposed electrode
for synergic detection of DA and UA in urine and/or milk samples.

The reproducibility
of CS–GS/GCE was evaluated by preparing
five parallel electrodes for the determination of 100 μM DA
and UA. The relative standard deviations of the five electrodes were
2.7 and 3.1% for DA and UA, respectively. The stability of the modified
electrode was also investigated. After the modified electrode was
kept at ambient temperature for 21 days, repeatable sensing performance
was achieved for the detection of DA and UA, suggesting that the sensor
has a good stability.

Conclusions
Finally, an electroactive
and covalently functionalized porous
CS–GS matrix was prepared via enhanced amidation for the first
time. Owing to its good electrochemical activity, high SSA, and 3D
porous film structure through enhanced amide functionalization, the
CS–GS matrix has received our attention for application as
an electrochemical biosensor for synergic determination of DA and
UA in the presence of AA and glucose. On the basis of the electrochemical
performances of CS–GS, the DA and UA can be determined simultaneously
within a larger detection range than that reported for other GS/CS-based
biosensors. Meanwhile, satisfactory results
were obtained for the determination of DA and UA in real samples with
a higher selectivity for the prepared biosensor matrix.

Experimental
Section
Enhanced Amidation Reaction between CS and GS
GO was
prepared from graphite powder (Aldrich, 325 mesh, 99.999%) via the
modified Hummer’s method.32,33 GO–COOH
was prepared with a modified procedure,17,34 as shown in Scheme 1. Briefly, 50 mg
of GO was loaded in a 50 mL round-bottom flask with 15 mL of dimethylformamide
(DMF). Then, 0.5 g of chloroacetic acid (Aldrich, Korea) and 0.6 g
of NaOH were added to the aforementioned solution; this solution was
maintained under ultrasonication for an hour and was subsequently
stirred for 3 h at room temperature (RT, ∼25 °C). The
solid was collected through filtration. Thereafter, 20 mg of CS, 20
mg of EDC (Aldrich, Korea), and 80 mg of NHS (Aldrich, Korea) were
mixed in 5 mL of DMF and added into 5 mL of the GO–COOH suspension
(5 mg mL–1 in DMF); again, the mixture maintained
under sonication for 3 h. As the final step, the above solution was
refluxed at 120 °C for a day. The as-obtained CS–GS was
filtered, washed several times with distilled water, and dried under
vacuum at 50 °C for 12 h. For comparison, GS and CS/GS were prepared
by the same procedure with little change. The GS was prepared with
the addition of NaBH4 instead of CS, and CS/GS was prepared
without chloroacetic acid treatment.

Physical Characterization
TEM images and energy-dispersive
X-ray spectroscopy images were obtained using the TECNAI model FI-20
(FEI, Netherland). SEM images were obtained on a JSM-7500F field emission
scanning electron microanalyzer (JEOL). The BET surface area and pore-size
distribution were obtained through the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda
method using the adsorption and desorption of the nitrogen isotherm
(BelsorpII mini; BEL Japan Inc.). XPS images were obtained using a
MultiLab 2000 with a 14.9 keV Al K X-ray source. Curve fitting was
conducted using an XPSPEAK41 system software. Dynamic light scattering
analysis of the samples was performed using Malvern Zetasizer Nano.

Electrochemical Characterization
All of the electrochemical
measurements, including CV and DPV, were conducted using a three-electrode
potentiostat (CHI 700C electrochemical workstation). A Pt wire and
Ag/AgCl electrodes were used as the auxiliary and reference electrodes,
respectively. EIS was performed on Versa State 3, manufactured by
Metek. The 1 mg mL–1 suspension of CS–GS
was prepared in water via ultrasonication. A 10 μL portion of
CS–GS ink was dropped onto the prepolished glassy carbon electrode
(GCE, 3 mm in diameter). CS/GS-coated GCE was also prepared by following
the same protocol. All electrochemical experiments were performed
in high-purity Ar-saturated 0.1 M PBS (at pH 7.4) electrolyte at RT
(∼25 °C).

Real Sample Preparation
For the
synergic determination
of DA and UA in cow milk samples, 1 L of cow milk was bought from
the local market and used directly at RT. The urine sample was simply
treated by centrifugation for 10 min at 5000 rpm to remove precipitated
proteins and other particulate matter. Finally, the spiked concentrations
of UA and DA
was added into the as-received cow milk and urine samples containing
Ar-saturated 0.1 M PBS and was calculated from the calibrated linear
regression equations.
