The
current work focuses on the ring-opening polymerization (ROP) of l-lactide (LLA) using N-heterocyclic
functionalized molecules as an initiator for the synthesis of metal-free
poly(l-lactide) (PLLA) conjugates. With this
motivation, we have used a drug molecule, nicotine, having N-heterocyclic
functionality as the initiator for the synthesis of PLLA conjugates. Structural characterizations carried out using matrix-assisted
laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry, Fourier
transform infrared, and NMR establish the reacting species during
polymerization in the absence of any side reactions. However, side
reactions occurred because of the absence of steric hindrance when
polymerization is initiated using nicotine in the presence of benzyl
alcohol. Accordingly, we report here a detailed investigation on the
mechanism of nicotine as an initiator and propose an anionic-based
mechanism for the ROP of LLA. Studies on
the kinetics parameters have been performed for the nicotine-initiated ROP of LLA and have found that polymerization
proceeds with a first-order dependence on both the monomer and initiator
concentrations with a low activation energy of 4.9 kcal·mol–1. Further, thermal release studies performed by hyphenated
thermogravimetric–Fourier transform infrared analysis found
that nicotine is released along with reduced toxins from these synthesized PLLA–nicotine conjugates. Thus, these PLLA–nicotine conjugates can in turn open up a new era in tobacco
industries for the preparation of synthetic cigarettes and also in
biomedical applications for drug delivery purposes. Herein, a few
preliminary experiments using another drug molecule, nicorandil, having
similar N-heterocyclic functionality were also conducted to support
the role of nicotine as an initiator for the synthesis of PLLA conjugates.

Introduction
In recent years, the worldwide interest
in biobased polymers is
greatly increasing, and they are being studied intensively because
of their ability to become a feasible alternative to petroleum-derived
plastics in various applications.1−3 Amongst various biobased
polymers available, polylactide [PLA], at present, is one of the most
promising polymers. PLA belongs mainly to the aliphatic polyester
family, commonly made from α-hydroxy carboxylic acids4 having enormous applications because of its tuneable
biodegradability, nontoxicity, and biocompatibility.5−10 PLA has found applications in various areas11 such as food packaging,12−15 textile industries,16 and
mainly in biomedical applications such as drug delivery, orthopedic
fixation devices,17 sutures, and so forth.18−21 Keeping in view its increasing applications, there has been a lot
of advancement in the field of PLA synthesis. Synthesis of PLA can
be carried out either in solution22 or
in bulk.23−25 However, bulk polymerization is a more favorable
technique for the production of PLA on a mass scale, as the rate of
polymerization is faster as compared to solution polymerization and
thus, we have focussed our investigations on the ring-opening polymerization
(ROP) of l-lactide (LLA) in bulk.
Numerous methods have already been exploited for the synthesis of
PLA in bulk which includes direct polycondensation,26,27 azeotropic-dehydrative condensation, melt/solid polycondensation,28−30 and ROP.31,32 Among the above synthesis
methods, only bulk ROP has the potential to yield PLA
with a high molecular weight within a short polymerization time and
thus is the most preferred technique.

Organometallic molecules33,34 including transition
metal complexes of tin, zinc, yttrium, and so forth are widely explored
as catalysts for PLA synthesis. Of the various metallic catalysts
available, stannous octoate is the most widely used organometallic
catalyst because of its high catalytic activity and also because it
was approved by the American Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for
food and biomedical applications.4 However,
the use of metallic catalysts leaves traces of metals in the final
polymeric product, which may pose undesirable problems for their use
in medical applications. Keeping this in view, over the last few years,
there has been a resurgence of interest in organocatalysts as a powerful
metal-free alternative to organometallic catalysts.

With this
motivation, we have focussed our investigations purely
on organic molecules based on N-heterocyclic functionality as initiators
for PLA synthesis. The utilization of N-heterocyclic carbenes (NHC),35−37N-N-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP),38 and phosphines39 acting
as effective organocatalysts to promote lactide polymerization, to
synthesize homo and copolymers has been reported in literature.36,37,40−42 Herein, we
have explored the initiation of LLA using the N-heterocyclic
molecule, nicotine, to synthesize poly(l-lactide) (PLLA)–nicotine conjugates. Investigations utilizing
a set of N-heterocyclic functionalized molecules consisting of 4-pyrrolidino-pyridine,
pyridine, pyrrole, 2-methyl-pyridine, and imidazole, which can effectively
initiate the LLA molecules to synthesize PLA,43 are already available in literature.

In
this work, we have successfully synthesized in situ PLLA conjugates under solvent-free bulk conditions having low molecular
weight (∼19 000 Da) as desired. We also carried out
polymerization reactions in the presence of a coinitiator such as
benzyl alcohol (BA) and observed the occurrence of undesirable side
reactions such as backbiting and cyclization under these conditions.
Accordingly, we have proposed the mechanism of this N-heterocyclic
molecule, nicotine, as the initiator both in the presence and absence
of BA and have also determined the kinetics parameters. The hyphenated
thermogravimetric–Fourier transform infrared (TG–FTIR)
technique is used to investigate the thermal release behavior of the
synthesized PLLA conjugates. This technique is most widely
used to detect the volatile species released during thermal degradation.44 Herein, we also present some preliminary experimental
results obtained using another N-heterocyclic drug molecule, nicorandil,
resulting in the synthesis of PLLA–nicorandil
conjugates.

Results and Discussion
In a series of experiments, ROP of LLA has been carried out using nicotine
as an initiator for PLA synthesis. Table 1 reports the overall
data obtained from our experiments which examine the behaviour of
the initiator, both in the presence and absence of a coinitiator such
as BA. In addition, we report the ROP of LLA using nicorandil without using BA at the optimized condition at
which the maximum molecular weight is obtained. It is noteworthy to
mention that gel permeation chromatographs show a unimodel distribution
which is in line with the polymer Mw distribution
that should be obtained during addition polymerization.

MALDI-TOF-MS Analysis
Matrix-assisted laser desorption
ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) analysis
of the synthesized PLLA conjugate samples has been performed.
The resultant spectra are used to investigate the species taking part
during the ROP of LLA using nicotine as an initiator
and for the determination of the end groups attached with the grown PLLA chains. PLLA synthesized via the ROP of LLA by nicotine, nicotine + BA, and nicorandil having
different end groups or formation of macrocyclics are represented
in eqs i–vi. i   ii   iii   iv   v   vi  where M1, M2, and M3 represent
the masses of PLLA chains bearing nicotine, M4 represents the masses of PLLA chains bearing
BA, M5 is for PLLA, and M6 represents the masses of PLLA chains bearing nicorandil as end groups. The term “x” denotes the number of lactyl repeat units having
an Mw value of 72 Da each. MLi+ (7), MNa+ (23), and MK+ (39)
are the molecular weights of sodium ion, potassium ion, and lithium
ion, respectively, attached with the PLLA chains.

MALDI-TOF-MS spectra of PLLA conjugates synthesized
using nicotine are shown in Figure 1. The spectra clearly show that PLLA synthesized
by nicotine contains two varied types of chains, obtained at masses,
in consistent with the above two equations (eqs i and ii) and hence confirm
the occurrence of nicotine at the terminal end of each PLLA chain.

Figure 1 MALDI-TOF-MS spectra of PLLA synthesized via the ROP of LLA using nicotine alone. Conditions:
[L]/[I] = 50 at 160 °C for 36 h.

PLLA conjugates synthesized using nicotine in
the
presence of BA (Figure 2) consist of three varied types of PLLA chains having
masses corresponding to eqs iii–v. These PLLA chains
can be considered as four different envelopes A, B, C, and D. Envelope
A refers to the PLLA chain having a nicotine terminal
with masses at an interval of 144 Da, similar to that in Figure 1 and confirms the
occurrence of lactide molecules in the absence of any side reactions.
Envelope B (x denotes even number of lactyl repeat
units) and envelope C (x denotes odd number of lactyl
repeat units) refer to BA-substituted PLLA chains which
correspond to eq iv (M4). The reason behind the occurrence of the
odd and even envelopes of x is the backbiting of
the propagating anionic species, which in turn results in the formation
of macrocyclics, free of initiator eq v. Out of the four envelopes formed, the envelopes related
to BA-terminated chains are found to be more prominent and hence BA
can be regarded as the chain transfer agent.

Figure 2 MALDI-TOF-MS spectrum
of PLLA conjugates synthesized
using nicotine with BA. Conditions: [L]/[I] = 50 for 36 h at 160 °C.
Peaks (A–D) relate to PLLA chains corresponding
to eqs iii and iv (with even x value), eq iv (with odd x value),
and eq vi, respectively.

Similarly, MALDI-TOF-MS spectra
of PLLA conjugates
synthesized by nicorandil shown in Figure 3 are found to be consistent with eq iv and hence confirm the
growth of PLLA chains having nicorandil at its terminal
end, occurring in the absence of any undesirable side reactions.

Figure 3 MALDI-TOF-MS
spectrum of PLLA conjugates synthesized
via the ROP of LLA using nicorandil alone.
Conditions: [L]/[I] = 50 for 36 h at 160 °C.

Hence, it can be clearly concluded that PLLA synthesized
using nicotine and nicorandil grows in the absence of any unwanted
side reaction. The reason behind this could be the association of
the bulky group with the structure of the N-heterocyclic functionalized
molecules which prevent substitution and in turn stop the backbiting
reactions of the propagating anions. However, using BA as the coinitiator
yields macrocyclic compounds because of the cyclization reaction.

NMR Analysis
Identification of the reactive species
taking part during the ROP of LLA initiated
using nicotine was carried out by recording 13C NMR spectra
of PLLA conjugate samples. Figure 4 shows the 13C NMR spectrum obtained
for PLLA using nicotine as the initiator, which exhibits
strong signals because of methyl carbon, methyne carbon, and carbonyl
carbon located at 16.7, 69.1, and 169.7 ppm, respectively, attributed
mainly to PLLA chains. The nicotine carbons exhibit weak
signals and appear at 148.8, 138.8, 134.7, 123.5, 68.8, 56.9, and
39.9 as indicated by letters d, e, f, g, h, i, and j, respectively.
An upfield magnetic shift in the Cα–N peak
of nicotine has been observed at 148.8 ppm wrt the carbon atom.

36 h at 160 °C. Species 1b according to Scheme 1.

Figure 5 shows the 13C NMR spectrum of PLLA synthesized via the polymerization
of LLA using nicotine along with BA. Strong signals appear
at 16.7, 69.1, and 169.7 ppm which are assigned to methyl carbon,
methyne carbon, and carbonyl carbon, respectively, of the PLLA chains along with additional peaks which correspond to carbons associated
with the benzyl ring at around 128.5, 128.6, and 128.7 ppm. Also,
a peak at 67.0 ppm is observed which is attributed to −CH2 of BA attached to the PLLA chain. This clearly
proves that BA partly substitutes nicotine on the PLLA chain. This observation also agrees with the spectrum (Figure 2) obtained from MALDI-TOF-MS
analysis.

= 50 for 36 h at 160 °C. Species 1b and 1c according to Scheme 1.

FTIR Analysis
Comparative FTIR spectra have been obtained
for PLLA conjugates synthesized via the ROP of LLA by nicotine with and without BA as shown in Figure 6. Both spectra clearly
show PLLA’s characteristic stretching frequencies
for νas(CH3), νs(CH3), ν(COC), and ν(C–COO) at 2997, 2948,
1276, and 865 cm–1, respectively. A strong band
present at 1757 cm–1 is attributed to the carbonyl
group present in the PLLA chain. Bending frequencies
for δas(CH3), δs(CH3), and δ(C=O) have been observed at 1458, 1386,
and 756 cm–1, respectively. A sharp peak at 1636
cm–1 corresponds to ν(CO–N) which highlights
the presence of the amide group. The C–O stretching frequencies
of PLLA are observed at 1185 and 1086 cm–1.

Figure 6 Comparative FTIR spectra of PLLA conjugates synthesized
using (a) nicotine alone and (b) nicotine + BA.

Additionally, in both spectra, a broad peak is observed in
the
range of 3400–3500 cm–1 which is attributed
to the stretching vibration of O–H in the hydroxyl group. A
band appearing around 500–516 cm–1 corresponds
to the in-plane bending of the O=C–N group formed by
the nicotine fragment, which occurs at the terminal end of the PLLA chain. Thus, this is in good agreement with the MALDI-TOF-MS
spectra, satisfying eqs i and ii. Furthermore, in combination with the
above peaks, Figure 6b shows a peak at 701 cm–1 (ring C=C), which
indicates the presence of BA-terminated PLLA chains and
is in agreement with eqs iv–vi of MALDI-TOF-MS spectra.

Similarly,
FTIR spectra of PLLA conjugates synthesized
using nicorandil alone (Figure 7) consist of PLLA’s characteristic stretching
frequencies for νas(CH3), νs(CH3), ν(C=O), ν(COC), and ν(C–COO)
at 2998, 2946, 1756, 1277, and 865 cm–1, respectively.
The absorption bands present at 1459, 1387, and 757 cm–1 correspond to bending frequencies for δas(CH3), δs(CH3), and δ(C=O),
respectively. A sharp peak present at 1623 cm–1 corresponds
to N–H amide bending of nicorandil. The C–O stretching
frequencies of PLLA are observed at 1185 and 1087 cm–1. The band appearing around 515 cm–1 represents the in-plane bend of O=C–N of the nicorandil
fragment, confirming the presence of nicorandil in the PLLA chain. This result is also well-explained by the MALDI-TOF-MS spectra
(Figure 3). Also, a
wide peak is present at 3501 cm–1 which occurs because
of the hydroxyl group attached to the terminal end of PLLA.

Figure 7 FTIR spectra of PLLA conjugates synthesized by the ROP of LLA using nicorandil.

Reaction Mechanism
We propose a generalized reaction
pathway for N-heterocyclic functionalized molecules nicotine and nicorandil
as initiators for polymerization carried out via the ROP of LLA as depicted in Scheme 1. First, LLA is initiated by the lone pair electrons of the N-heterocyclic nitrogen
atom of the N-heterocyclic functionalized molecule forming an active
anionic adduct (1a). Entity 1(a) sequentially adds up
the molecules of LLA forming a PLLA chain
having the N-heterocyclic functionalized molecule at its terminal
end (1b), as confirmed by two equations (eqs i and ii) and eq vi as obtained in MALDI-TOF-MS
analysis (Figures 1 and 3). Here, the ROP of LLA proceeds in the absence of side reactions, which may be
because of the presence of steric hindrance in the initiator as suggested
in an earlier work reported in literature.38

Scheme 1 Reaction Scheme Proposed for the ROP of LLA Using Only the N-Heterocyclic Functionalized Molecules Produces
Entities 1a and 1b, whereas the Presence
of BA Produces 1c and 1d along with 1b
However, if LLA polymerization is carried out using
BA, acting as the coinitiator, the benzyl oxide anion of BA takes
part in transfer reactions with some of the growing chains of PLLA (1b) and follows path 1 (Scheme 1), generating a benzyl oxide-terminated
entity (1c), with the release of the N-heterocyclic functionalized
molecule used. The released N-heterocyclic molecule can then be further
utilized by the LLA left as the residue. Hence, under
otherwise identical conditions, comparatively higher conversions are
achieved in the case of polymerization carried out in the presence
of a coinitiator, even though the molecular weight of PLLA obtained is found to be lower. Also, macrocyclics (1d) are found to form when the coinitiator BA is used, as indicated
by eq v in MALDI-TOF-MS
spectra (Figure 2).
This is one of the reasons for the yield of PLLA having
a lower molecular weight when the polymerization of LLA was carried out in the presence of BA as compared to PLLA synthesized via the polymerization of LLA, initiated
with the N-heterocyclic functionalized molecules alone.

Thus, Scheme 1 clearly
shows that synthesis of PLLA conjugates via the ROP of LLA using N-heterocyclic functionalized
molecules such as nicotine and nicorandil follows an anionic chain
growth mechanism in the presence of side reactions such as transesterification
reactions. However, side reactions occur only when the polymerization
is carried out in the presence of a small amount of a coinitiator
such as BA or when there is no steric hindrance in the initiator.

Effect of Reaction Parameters on the ROP of LLA Using Nicotine as the Initiator
Effect of Reaction Time
and Temperature
A set of ROP reactions using
nicotine as the initiator have been performed.
GPC studies revealed that number average molecular weight, Mn is found to increase with time and reaches
its highest value at 36 h for the reactions carried out at 160 °C
as shown in Figure 8. The Mn as well as percentage conversion
increase up to 36th h of polymerization, beyond which a decreasing
trend is observed for the same.

Figure 8 Plot of Mn as a function of nicotine-initiated
reaction time for [L]/[I] = 50.

Also, to determine the effect of ROP temperature,
experiments have been performed varying the temperature, and the highest Mn value has been observed for the reactions
carried out at 160 °C, as shown in Figure 9. Subsequently, it has been observed that
for reactions conducted at a high temperature, that is, 180 °C,
there is a gradual reduction in Mn as
well as percentage conversion (Table 1). Herein, at 160 °C, molecular weight is found
to increase during the whole polymerization course, and only the propagating
entity 1b is observed in MALDI-TOF-MS spectra (Figure 1). However, ROP carried out at 160 °C using nicotine + BA for 36
hours yields comparatively low Mw PLA
because of the yield of isolated entities 1c and 1d. Undesirable side reactions such as transesterification
or termination reactions may occur at higher temperatures mainly via
the terminal anionic end groups. These anionic species dominate over
propagating chains and thus, the polymerization proceeds more rapidly
with temperature, which in turn also affects the rates of side reactions
such as transesterification, backbiting, and chain redistribution.
Thus, to achieve the desired high MwPLLA, polymerization should be preferably performed at a temperature
of 160 °C for 36 h in the absence of BA.

Figure 9 Plot of Mn as a function of nicotine-initiated
reaction temperature for [L]/[I] = 50.

Effect of Nicotine Concentration as the Initiator
The
effect of the nicotine concentration as the initiator on the polymerization
of LLA was determined by varying the molar ratio of LLA to nicotine, [L]/[I] = 50–500 at the optimum ROP temperature and time, that is, at 160 °C for 36 h.
The results concluded that both Mn as
well as monomer conversion of PLLA decrease as the [L]/[I]
molar ratio increases from 50 to 500, as shown in Figure 10. Similar published work43 on the ROP of LLA using
N-heterocyclic molecules such as PDP, imidazole, and so forth also
showed a similar pattern in the Mn of PLLA wrt the initiator concentration. Herein, at the LLA to nicotine molar ratio ([L]/[I]) = 50, the nicotine concentration
is maximum, providing the highest value of Mn, and the Mw value gradually decreases
as the concentration of nicotine decreases.

ratio of LLA to nicotine at 160 °C for 36 h.

Kinetics Study of the Nicotine-Initiated ROP of LLA
The kinetics parameters during
polymerization
were investigated to examine the rate of the nicotine-initiated ROP of LLA. 1H NMR has been recorded
to determine the conversion for the kinetics studies. A plot of the
residual monomer as a function of the reaction time is depicted in Figure 11 which reveals
an exponential-like decay in the temperature range of 120–160
°C, indicating that the nicotine-initiated ROP of LLA satisfies first-order kinetics in terms of the monomer
concentration. The data produced yield a good fit to the assumption
of the apparent rate constant, kapp, which
increases with the increase in the ROP temperature from
120–160 °C.

Figure 11 Plot of −ln([L]/[L0]) vs ROP time
for the nicotine-initiated ROP of LLA at
120, 140, and 160 °C for the molar ratio [L]/[I] = 50.

Accordingly, the activation energy, Ea, of ROP is determined experimentally
using the Arrhenius
equation, kapp = A e(−Ea/RT), with kapp values (0.0019, 0.0027, and
0.0031 min–1) obtained from Figure 11 at 120, 140, and 160 °C yielding a
low activation energy value of 4.9 kcal·mol–1 which is found to be lower than that reported for the PDP-initiated
anionic ROP of LLA (5.6 kcal·mol–1)43 and the coordination
insertion mechanism of LLA (19.55 kcal·mol–1).28,39

Effect of the Nicotine Concentration on the
Reaction Rate
The functional form of the polymerization rate
describing this
system can be considered as −d[L]/dt = kapp[L], where kapp represents the apparent rate constant and is related to the initiator
concentration as kapp = kabs([L]/[I])a, where kabs represents the absolute reaction rate constant.
A plot of kapp values (obtained from Figure 12) versus initial
initiator concentration [I0] is plotted, and the slope
of the curve gives the value of exponent “a” as −0.8. Thus, it can be inferred that nicotine-initiated ROP satisfies first-order reaction kinetics in terms of the
initiator concentration.

Hyphenated TG–FTIR Analysis of Evolved Gases
The thermal stability of the synthesized PLLA samples
has been analyzed using the thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) technique.
TGA has been coupled with FTIR to obtain detailed information about
the evolution of volatile components at various stages during the
thermal degradation process. The trends of the thermogram (TG) and
differential TG curves of PLLA conjugates are shown in Figure 13a,b. As it can
be seen from the graph, temperature T10, at which 10% weight loss occurs, is found to be 298 °C, and
the maximum degradation temperature (Tmax) is found to be at 381 °C. Similarly, the TG curve (Figure 13b) of PLLA synthesized using nicorandil clearly depicts T10 at 292 °C and Tmax at 378
°C. In the GS (Gram-Schmidt Curve), only one peak is noticeable
in both curves which indicate that degradation occurs in a single
step and the volatile products are detectable beyond 277 °C.

[L]/[I] = 50 at 160 °C for 36 h.

Figure 14a,b displays
the 3D FTIR spectrum and stack plots, respectively, corresponding
to the thermal degradation of PLLA synthesized using
nicotine by heating at the rate of 10 °C/min under an argon atmosphere
in a continuous mode. Figures 14b and 15b illustrates the stacked
IR spectra for the main decomposition process of PLLA synthesized using nicotine and nicorandil from intervals 277–420
°C and 274–418 °C, respectively. As reported in literature,45,46 the main decomposition product, lactide, shows characteristic bands
because of ν(C–H), νas(CH3), and νs(CH3) at 3006, 2958, and 2893
cm–1. The high intensity of the band at 1792 cm–1 (ν(C=O)), 1238 and 1110 cm–1 (ν(C–O–C)), and 933 cm–1 (ring
skeleton), and carbon dioxide (νas(2358–2340)
cm–1) are also detectable above the onset temperature
in both cases. It can thus be inferred that the major volatile products
of thermal decomposition of PLLA are released with the
highest intensity at the Tmax. It is also
noticed that the intensity of absorption bands corresponding to different
volatile products increases gradually with the increase of temperature.
This is in agreement with the TGA plots, and the intensity of absorption
band continuously decreases after the highest peak. Moreover, the
absorption related to carbon dioxide at bands 2358–2310 cm–1 (νas (O=C=O)) and
669 cm–1 (δ(O=C=O)) and double
apex related to carbon monoxide at 2176–2118 cm–1 (δ(C–O)) also appeared till the end of the thermal
decomposition but with a lowered intensity.

Figure 16 depicts
the comparison between the FTIR spectra of PLLA synthesized
using nicotine and nicorandil. The slight differences are in the wave
number ranges of 2600–3000 cm–1 and 1000–1500
cm–1. From the FTIR profiles, it can be interpreted
that the total amount of volatile products for PLLA synthesized
using nicorandil is lower than that from nicotine. Almost no water
is evolved in the case of PLLA synthesized using nicorandil,
although there is an evolution of water in the case of nicotine. A
small amount of CO2 is observed in the thermal decomposition
of PLLA synthesized using nicorandil which might be because
of the lowest intensity of the carbonyl group (C=O).

Figure 16 Comparison
between FTIR spectra of PLLA synthesized
via the ROP of LLA using nicotine and nicorandil
as the initiator at Tmax.

For PLLA synthesized using nicotine
inspecting the
IR spectra at Tmax, the peaks at 1117–1189
cm–1 (CH2 wag), 1418–1478 cm–1 (in-plane and sym C–H wag),
and 717 cm–1 (out-of-plane δ(C–H))
can be associated with pyridine.47 In addition,
there are coinciding absorption peaks of 2779 cm–1 (N–CH3) present in nicotine and 2738 cm–1 (C–H stretching, νs(CHO)) in aldehyde which
is evolved from degradation of PLLA. This indicates that
the generation of aldehyde and the release of nicotine occur at the
same time. It demonstrates that the release of nicotine is confirmed
at the mass loss stage (381–395 °C) with the absorption
bands disappearing above 395 °C in the IR spectra. Thus, nicotine
is released from the synthesized PLLA–nicotine
conjugates along with reduced toxins upon its exposure to heat, which
opens up a new area of its high-end applications in developing toxin-free
synthetic cigarettes and in the biomedical field. The new advent peaks
at 2930 and 2821 cm–1 belong to νs(CH2) and νas(CH2), respectively,
and this indicates the formation of alkane and alkyl substitutes.48 In addition, the peak at 1033 cm–1 is attributed to ν(C–O) for methanol in the FTIR spectra.49,50 Lactide is identified by the bands at 3006 cm–1 (ν(C–H)), 2952 cm–1 (νas(CH3)), 2893 cm–1 (νs(CH3)), 1792 cm–1 (ν(C=O)),
1452–1381 cm–1 (δ(CH3)),
1242 and 1106 cm–1 (ν(C–O–C)),
and 930 cm–1 (ring skeleton). Two prominent absorption
bands at 1762 cm–1 (ν(C=O)) and 2738
cm–1 (C–H stretching, ν(CHO)), weak
bands at 2963 cm–1 (νas(CH2)) and 1371 cm–1 (δ(CH2)) described that aldehyde45,46,51 is also formed during the degradation of PLLA. The
FTIR spectrum of the evolved gases shows the production of water from
the peaks 3638 cm–1 (νas(OH)) and
3577 cm–1 (νs(OH)) generated by
the cleavage of hydroxyl groups. Formation of the NO2 compound
is confirmed because of the signal observed at 1352 cm–1 in PLLA synthesized using nicorandil which is overlapped
with many small peaks at this region.

Conclusions
This
work reports the successful synthesis of metal-free PLLA conjugates via the ROP of LLA using nicotine
as well as nicorandil drug molecules as initiators
via the N-functionalized initiation of these molecules without any
side reactions. MALDI-TOF-MS analysis confirmed the existence of the
initiator at the terminal end of the PLLA chain. On the
basis of the analysis, an anionic mechanism has been proposed for
the ROP of LLA carried out using nicotine
in the presence and absence of a coinitiator. Also, kinetics studies
revealed that the nicotine-initiated ROP of LLA satisfies first-order kinetics in terms of LLA and
initiator concentration with an activation energy which is found to
be lower than that for PDP-initiated ROP as well as tin
octoate-initiated ROP. These N-heterocyclic functionalized
molecules, thus, are proved to be acting as initiators for synthesis
of PLLA. Further, thermal release studies performed by
TG–FTIR analysis found that nicotine is released from these
synthesized PLLA–nicotine conjugates. Thus, these PLLA–nicotine conjugates may effectively be used in
tobacco industries to prepare synthetic cigarettes because of their
characteristic release of nicotine with reduced toxins upon their
exposure under heat and may also be useful for biomedical applications
such as drug delivery.

Experimental Section
Materials
LLA has been synthesized in
the laboratory from l-lactic acid, ≥99%, PF 90, Purac
(The Netherlands) and recrystallized two times using distilled ethyl
acetate and kept under vacuum drying for 24 h prior to use. N-heterocyclic
functionalized molecules such as nicotine (≥99%, GC grade)
in the liquid form and nicorandil (≥98%, HPLC grade) in the
powder form were obtained directly from Sigma-Aldrich (India) and
explored as initiators for the synthesis of PLLA conjugates.
Chloroform, BA, and acetone were purchased directly from Merck-India.

ROP Procedure
Initially, LLA has
been recrystallized two times using distilled ethyl acetate
and dried under vacuum for 24 h prior to use. ROP reactions
have been performed in glass ampoules sealed under vacuum. The glass
ampoules were first filled with the monomer (LLA), and
then the calculated amount of the initiator, with varying LLA to the initiator molar ratio ([L]/[I]) in the range of 50–500,
is subsequently added to the ampoules. Fewer polymerization reactions
have been carried out using a coinitiator such as BA, where the composition
of the initiator: coinitiator is kept equimolar. Then, the ampoules
were vacuum-dried while being immersed in an oil bath maintained at
a temperature of 60 °C for a period of 2 h. After two hours,
the ampoules were sealed under vacuum and kept for polymerization
within the temperature range of 120–180 °C in a hot air
oven attached with an inbuilt magnetic stirrer. At the predetermined
reaction time interval (12, 24, 36 and 48 h), the glass ampoules were
removed, and the polymer was cooled by dipping the ampoule in ice-cooled
water to stop polymerization. Finally, the sealed ampoules were broken
and the contents analyzed for characterizations.

Characterizations
Gel
Permeation Chromatography
Number average [Mn] and weight average [Mw]
molecular weights have been obtained using Shimadzu’s
Prominence GPC (Prominence GPC RID-10A detector) with two PL gel 5
μm (300 × 7.5 mm) columns used for separation, calibrated
with polystyrene standards in chloroform.

Fourier Transform Infrared
Spectroscopy
FTIR spectra
of PLLA samples were recorded with a PerkinElmer Frontier
FTIR spectrometer; samples were grounded into a powdered form and
were evaluated using the KBr pellet technique in transmission in the
spectral range of wavenumber 4000–450 cm–1 having a resolution of 4 cm–1 at an average of
16 scans. Synthesized PLA is dissolved in chloroform and subsequently
precipitated in methanol to remove unreacted lactide and nicotine
from the product.

MALDI-TOF-MS
MALDI-TOF-MS analyses
have been performed
using a Bruker Autoflex Speed MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer, employing
a 19 kV accelerating voltage with each spectrum scanning 500 shots.
The sample preparation is done using an α-cyano-4-hydroxy-cinnamic
acid matrix (10 mg mL–1). The analyte solution (1
μL, 10 mg mL–1) is first mixed with 1 μL
of matrix solution (50:50 v/v, CHCA/acetonitrile) and then put onto
a stainless steel sample plate and allowed to dry.

Nuclear Magnetic Resonance
Spectroscopy
To identify
the species taking part during the ROP of LLA, the synthesized PLLA samples are analyzed via 1H and 13C NMR measurements in deuterated chloroform
(CDCl3) at ambient temperature on a Bruker 600 MHz NMR
spectrometer. 1H NMR analysis has been done to study the
conversion for kinetic studies. The residual LLA at various ROP conditions has been determined using eq vii.

Percent of the remaining monomer (W/W %) is calculated using equation vii  where, Iq,LLA and Iq,PLLA are the
integral areas of peaks related to the lactide (LLA)
and polymer methine quartets (PLLA) located at 5.04 and
5.2 ppm, respectively. Low reaction time has been chosen to find out
the noticeable change in the conversion which is low at initial polymerization.

The kinetics parameters are investigated to examine the rate of
nicotine-initiated the ROP of LLA. Experiments
have been performed at different temperatures (120, 140, and 160 °C)
for 30, 60, 90, 120, and 150 min by keeping the L/I ratio (50) constant.
The obtained products from the reaction are analyzed, and conversion
for kinetics studies is determined via 1H NMR.

Thermogravimetric Analysis
Thermal stability has been
determined using a PerkinElmer TGA 4000 thermogravimetric analyzer
at a heating rate of 10 °C min–1 in the temperature
range of 30–600 °C under argon flow. TGA analyzer is coupled
to FTIR (Frontier 4000) through a TL 8000 transfer line. High purity
argon gas with a flow rate of 50 mL min–1 is applied
to maintain the inert atmosphere. The FTIR spectra are recorded in
the spectral range of 4000–450, and 8 cm–1 resolution is selected at an average of 4 scans.
