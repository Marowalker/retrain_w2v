Design and fabrication
of multifunctional porous structures play key roles in the development
of high-performance energy storage devices. Our experiments demonstrated
that nanostructured porous components, such as electrodes and interlayers,
generated from the protein-directed self-assembly of nanoparticles
can significantly improve the battery performances. The protein-directed
assembly of nanoparticles in solution is a complex process involving
the complicated interactions among proteins, particles, and solvent
molecules. In this paper, we investigate the effects of coating proteins
and specific solvent environments on the assembled porous structures.
Comprehensive dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) simulations have
been implemented to explore the molecular interactions and uncover
the fundamental mechanisms in a gelatin-directed self-assembly of
carbon black particles under different solvent conditions. Our simulations
show that compact triple-strand “rod-like” structures
are formed in water while loose curved “sheet-like”
structures are formed in an acetic acid/water mixture. The structural
difference is mainly due to the redistribution of the charges on the
gelatin side chains under specific acid-solvent conditions. The strong
and flexible “sheet-like” structures lead to a homogenous
porous structure with high porosity and with large functionalized
surfaces. Our simulations results can reasonably explain the experimental
observations; this work demonstrates the great potential of DPD as
a powerful tool in guiding future experimental design and optimization.

1 Introduction
The
advanced energy storage devices (ESDs) are in great demand due to
the rapid development of portable electronics, electric vehicles,
and storage systems for solar and wind energies.1−3 High energy-density
rechargeable battery systems, such as lithium-ion batteries, lithium–sulfur
batteries, and lithium–air batteries are of great interest
in the development of next-generation ESDs.4−9 However, there are still persistent critical issues to be addressed,
especially for the ultrahigh energy battery systems.3,10,11 The notable volume change of
high-capacity electrodes such as silicon and sulfur, calls for unique
electrode architectures or fabrication processes in order to stabilize
the electrodes.12 More severely, the electrochemical
intermediates of sulfur (polysulfides) that are able to dissolve in
liquid electrolytes bring about a shuttle effect, which significantly
deteriorates the battery performance.2,13−17 To resolve these issues, tremendous efforts have been devoted to
the fabrication of nanostructured porous electrodes enabling fast
ionic/electronic transport and buffering of volume expansion.18−22 Meanwhile, functional battery interlayers with rational porous structures
have been demonstrated to have good abilities to facilitate ionic
transport and suppress the diffusion/migration of polysulfides.23−28 Therefore, the generation of good and functional porous structures
plays a vital role in achieving high energy and power densities for
ESDs.

A variety of strategies have been implemented in the fabrication
of porous structures for different battery applications, but it remains
challenging to rationally design and fabricate a porous structure
with the desired properties and functionalities.21,29−32 Recently, Fu et al.19,23 reported successful fabrications
of a three-dimensional porous nanostructured electrode and an interlayer
through a protein-directed self-assembly process. As reported, unique
porous structures with protein functionalized surfaces can facilitate
the ionic transport, increase the binding between electrode and electrolyte,
and effectively trap the dissolved polysulfides. The overall electrochemical
performance of the battery has been greatly improved by employing
these protein-based porous structures. The work has demonstrated that
the porous structures generated from the protein-directed self-assembled
process pose great potential in the development of high-performance
ESDs. In addition, it was also found in experiments that the final
porous structures were strongly dependent on the coating materials
and the specific solvent environments during fabrication.

Although
porous structures from protein-coated nanoparticles have been fabricated
and characterized in experiments,19,23 the picture
of a protein-directed self-assembly process under different conditions
in a solution state is largely unclear and difficult to measure in
experiments. The assembly process is complex and involves complicated
interactions among solvent molecules, proteins, and particles. Understanding
the molecular scale interactions and the fundamental mechanisms during
a self-assembly process in the solution state is significantly important
for further design and optimization of porous structures for battery
applications. Simulations with certain molecular details play key
roles in uncovering the molecular mechanisms involved in such complicated
systems. Among different simulation algorithms, the dissipative particle
dynamics (DPD) method is an effective mesoscale coarse-grained simulation
technique with reasonable accuracy and efficiency. The DPD method
has been proven to be a useful approach to investigate the phase behavior
of soft matter systems.33−36 Recently, the DPD method has been successfully employed
to study the self-assembly process of micelles, fibers, nanorods,
vesicles.37−41 and polymer systems.42−46

In this work, we systematically investigate the self-assembly
process of protein-coated carbon black (CB) particles in the solution
state through comprehensive DPD simulations. We will explore the effects
from different coating materials [polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) polymer
or gelatin protein], surface coating density, and solvent environments
[N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP), deionized (DI) water
or acetic acid (AA)/DI mixture], on the self-assembled structures.
The simulation results and conclusions may provide guidelines for
further improvement of the fabrication process and eventually lead
to better performance of ESDs.

2 Materials and Methods
2.1 Experimental Methods
For completeness, we have redone
our previous experiments23 including fabrication
of the CB nanocomposites with different coating materials and characterization
of the morphology and porosity of the final self-assembled porous
structures. The detailed descriptions of the experiments are provided
in the Supporting Information.

2.2 DPD Algorithm
The simulations presented in this paper
are based on the DPD method.34 The DPD
is a mesoscopic coarse-grained simulation method for soft materials.
In DPD simulations, a small group of atoms are coarse-grained into
a single bead and the dynamics of each bead is governed by Newton’s
equation of motion. The total force Fi acting on bead i is
calculated from three types of pairwise forces: 1  Here, FijC is the conservative force, FijD is the dissipative force, and FijR is the random force from bead j within a cut-off
distance rC. Each term in eq 1 can be calculated as 2   3   4  where aij is the maximum repulsion between beads i and j, the value can be calculated from the liquid compressibility
and solubility (see eq 5 below); r̂ij is the unit vector and rij is the distance between beads i and j; vij = vi – vj is the relative velocity;  is the weight
function; σ is noise strength and γ is the friction coefficient,
and they follow a relation: σ2 = 2γkBT; kBT is the unit of energy, and the standard
values of 3.0 and 4.5 are used for σ and γ, respectively;
ζij denotes a random number with
zero mean and unit variance. All the variables are nondimensionalized
in the DPD simulations by the mass of solvent beads m0, the cut-off distance rC, and energy unit kBT.

2.3 Coarse-Grained Models
In this paper,
we simulate the self-assembly of PVDF- or gelatin-coated CB particles
in different solutions. Figure 1 shows the schematic representations of different types of
coarse-grained beads for all the components that have been studied
in our simulations. Specifically, two water molecules are grouped
into one DPD bead and denoted as type (W) (Figure 1a). As a result, the effective volume of
a DPD bead is ∼60 Å3. Accordingly, the interaction
cut-off distance rC ≈ 5.65 Å.
CB particles are constructed as a sphere with a diameter of 3.0 by
setting the DPD bead (CB) on a FCC lattice with a lattice constant
of α = 0.34 nm. The CB particles are modeled as rigid body throughout
the simulations (Figure 1b). For solution molecules, each AA molecule is grouped into one
bead (A) (Figure 1c),
and each NMP molecule is treated as two beads connected by a spring
force with a force constant of 100. The NMP molecule is represented
as the DPD bead type (NMP) (Figure 1d).

Figure 1 Schematic representation of molecular structures and the
coarse-grained DPD models for (a) water, (b) CB particles, (c) AA
molecules, (d) NMP molecules, (e) PVDF monomer, and (f) chemical structure
of gelatin. In the following figures, unless otherwise stated, the
color codes are the same as this figure.

The PVDF polymer (−[C2H2F2]n−) is modeled as bead-spring
chains that consist of 9 consecutive beads (P). One monomer of the
PVDF polymer has an effective volume of ∼60 Å3.47 Therefore, each bead represents one
monomer −[C2H2F2]–
(Figure 1e). The gelatin
structure is more complicated as shown in Figure 1f. The chemical structure of gelatin is arranged
in the following sequence: -Ala-Gly-Pro-Arg-Gly-Glu-4Hyp-Gly-Pro-.48 In our model following the mapping procedures
in refs,49,50 glycine with an effective residue volume around 60 Å3 will be treated as a single bead51 and
denoted as the skeletal bead (S). Accordingly, the −NH–CH2–CO– structure connecting adjacent residues
will be represented as skeletal beads (S) as well. In addition, proline
and hydroxyproline are modeled as skeletal beads (S) bonded to a side
bead (T). Arginine is a positively charged side chain and is mapped
as three connecting beads, where the positively charged bead (H) is
attached to a noncharged side bead (T) and then connected with the
skeletal bead (S). The negatively charged glutamic acid is modeled
as a skeletal bead (S) connected with a negatively charged bead (H).
Therefore, a typical structure of gelatin is represented as 9 connected
skeleton beads (S) plus some side-chain beads (T) or (H).

Two
consecutive beads (i and j) in PVDF
and gelatin are connected by a spring force FB = Kb(rij – r0)r̂ij, where Kb and r0 are the spring constant and equilibrium bond length, respectively.
Here, Kb = 100, r0 = 0.6rC is used for gelatin49 and Kb = 20, r0 = 0.85rC is used
for PVDF.42 The harmonic angle style potential Uθ = Kθ(θ – θ0)2 is applied on
two consecutive bonds for both gelatin and polymer chains, where Kθ, θ, and θ0 are
the bending constant, inclination angle, and equilibrium angle. For
three consecutive skeleton beads (S) of gelatin or three consecutive
PVDF beads (P), the bending constant and equilibrium angle are set
as Kθ = 6 and θ0 = 180° to keep the chain structures. For the angle between
the S–S bond and S–T bond on gelatin, the parameters
chosen as Kθ = 4.5 and θ0 = 90° were taken for the skeleton beads and side-chain
beads of gelatin. Gelatin chains and polymer chains were anchored
to the surface of a CB nanoparticle by a spring force with Kb = 200, r0 = 0.2.
Counterions were added to neutralize the system in the simulation,
and represented as bead (e).

2.4 Force-Field Parameters
In this work, the conservative interaction parameter between the
same type of particles is set to aij = 25kBT/rC, and for two beads of different types (e.g.,
A-type beads and B-type beads), the repulsive parameters can be calculated
as34 5  where aAB is the repulsive parameters between A-type beads and B-type beads
and χAB is the Flory–Huggins interaction parameter.
The value of χAB will depend on the solubility parameter
of each component, the temperature, and the average volume of the
beads:52 6  where Vbead is the average volume of a DPD bead; δA and δB are the solubility parameters of
bead type A and B, respectively. The repulsive parameters implemented
in this work are either calculated from eqs 5 and 6 or adopted from
published papers.49,53 A summary of all repulsion parameters
is presented in Table 1 below.

The electrostatic interactions between charged
beads are modeled using the “smeared charge” approach
with the Slater-type charge density distribution which has an exponential
decay. This model can remove the divergence of the Coulombic interactions
at r = 0.54,55 7  Here, λ is the decay length
of the charge. The pairwise electrostatic force FijE between charged particles i and j at short range with a truncation of 3.0 in
real space can be computed as 8  

At long range, the electrostatic interaction of smeared charges reduces
to the Coulombic potential and the standard Ewald summation with the
integer cut-off 16 in reciprocal space. The value of λ is chosen
such that the reciprocal of the decay length β = 1/λ =
0.929. The charge distribution on the protein side chains is determined
from the pH values of the solution and will be discussed later.

For mixed solvents such as the AA/DI mixture in this study, the conventional
DPD method has significant drawbacks in predicting the physical properties.56 It is due to the fact that the repulsive parameter aij is calculated by solubility
parameter δ, where the contribution of hydrogen bonds is implicitly
included based on the Hansen approach. Recently, Kacar and de With57 have solved this problem by adding a Morse potential
term VMorse(r) = D0[e–2ϵ(r–r0)–2 e–ϵ(r–r0)] to the conservative
DPD potential to explicitly model the hydrogen bond interactions between
mixture solvent beads (A and W in this work). Here, D0 and ϵ represent the depth and width of the potential,
and r0 is the hydrogen bond equilibrium
distance. The value of ϵ is set as 2. The cut-off value for
the hydrogen bond is taken as the same as that of the nonbonded cut-off
of DPD potential. We have performed all-atom molecular dynamics simulations
of a AA/DI mixture with a weight ratio of 8:2, the hydrogen bond equilibrium
distance is estimated from the radial distribution functions (RDFs)
between the center of mass of the hydrogen bond molecules as r0 = 0.45. The value of D0 was estimated from the potential differences of the mixture
and the pure components56 as D0 ≈ 12kBT.

2.5 Simulation Set Up
Three self-assembly
systems: PVDF-coated CB particles (PVDF/CB) in NMP, gelatin-coated
CB particles (gelatin/CB) in DI water, and gelatin-coated CB particles
(gelatin/CB) in an AA/water (AA/DI) mixture were prepared through
PACKMOL58 according to the experimental
conditions. PVDF/CB in the NMP solvent was simulated with the standard
DPD method. Gelatin/CB in DI water and gelatin/CB in the AA/DI mixture
solvent were simulated using the modified DPD algorithm with electrostatic
force and Morse potential included (Section 2.3). In our simulations, the velocity-Verlet
integration algorithm is used to update the positions of each bead,
and the integration time step Δt is set to
0.02τ, here  is the time unit in our simulations. All the variables in DPD simulations
are nondimensionalized by the cut-off distance rC, bead mass m0, and energy kBT. The size of the simulation
box is 48rC × 48rC × 48rC, which contains
a total of 331 776 beads with the number density of ρ
= 3/rC3. All simulations were
performed in the NVE ensembles, and the periodic
boundary conditions are adopted in all three directions. The DPD units
can be converted into SI units based on the mapping scheme:  , m0 ≈
60 g/mol, and τ ≈ 2.8 ps. All simulations in this work
were carried out by using the LAMMPS59 for
500 000 timesteps. Three independent realizations in each case
were performed for statistical consistency.

3 Results and Discussion
Our previous experiments23 demonstrated that the final porous structures
are highly dependent on both the coating materials and solvent environments.
(Please see the Supporting Information for
related descriptions and discussions.) The molecular interactions
and self-assembly behaviors of coated particles in different solvents
play critical roles in the determination of the final porous structures
after evaporation. Therefore, we perform a series of DPD simulations
to systematically explore the fundamental mechanisms involved in the
self-assembly of PVDF- or gelatin-coated CB particles. Mimicking the
experimental conditions, three cases with different coatings and different
solvents have been implemented: (1) PVDF/CB in NMP; (2) gelatin/CB
in DI water; and (3) gelatin/CB in the AA/DI mixture. In each case
we run three independent realizations for statistical consistency.
All realizations yield similar results, therefore only one of the
realizations is shown in the following sections for each case.

3.1 DPD Studies on PVDF-Coated CB Particles in NMP
We first
setup our simulations to study the self-assembly of PVDF-coated CB
particles in NMP (the simulation details can be found in the Materials and Methods section). The number of the
coating PVDF chains is varied from 1 to 3 to account for the weak
interaction between PVDF and CB. Figure 2 shows the equilibrium snapshots of the systems
at the end of the simulations. As shown, the PVDF-coated particles
are well dispersed in the simulation box regardless of the coating
number. In addition, we did not observe any assembled structures throughout
the simulations. NMP is well known as a good organic solvent to disperse
CB in the experiment, which is in good agreement with the observations
from the simulations.

chain coating, (b) 2 PVDF chains coating, and (c) 3 PVDF chains coating.
NMP beads are not shown for clarity.

3.2 DPD Studies on Gelatin-Coated CB Particles
in DI Water
The experiments (see Figure S1 and associated discussions in Supporting Information) indicated that in DI water the interactions between
gelatin and CB are weak and a large amount of gelatin chains cannot
be attached on the CB particle surface. Therefore, a small number
(1–3) of gelatin chains are attached on the particles in our
DPD simulations. As shown in Figure 1, a typical structure of gelatin contains two charged
functional residues (arginine and glutamic acid) on side chains, both
of which are denoted as (H) beads in our coarse grained model. The
distribution of charges on the residues is sensitive to the pH value
of the solvent. In this work the values of the charges are determined
by the pKa values of amino acids and the
pH values according to ref (60). 9  where the positive
sign accounts for basic amino acids (such as arginine on gelatin)
and negative sign accounts for acidic amino acids (such as glutamic
acid on gelatin).61 According to this equation,
arginine has a positive charge, while glutamic acid has a negative
charge. As indicated in Figure 3a. The overall charge on each chain is neutral. Figure 3b–d show the equilibrium
structures as the number of gelatin coating changes from one to three.
As illustrated, clear self-assembled “rod-like” structures
are formed in all three cases. The number of gelatin coatings also
affects the structure details. As shown in Figure 3b, small solitary clusters and several “rod-like”
segments are formed with only 1 gelatin chain coated onto the CB surface.
The length of the “rod-like” segment is short and some
of the segments are connected through a small aggregate. When the
gelatin coating number is increased to two, as illustrated in Figure 3c, the length of
“rod-like” segments is increased, and all segments are
connected by a few ball-like clusters. As the gelatin coating is further
increased, as shown in Figure 3d for three gelatin coating, longer rods with less branches
are formed.

water. (a) Charge distribution on gelatin side chains in DI water.

not shown for clarity.

3.3 DPD Studies on Gelatin-Coated CB Particles
in the AA/DI Mixture
The situation changes dramatically in
the AA/DI mixture at pH = 2. First of all, according to eq 9 glutamic acid has zero charge,
but arginine remains positively charged. Consequently, the net charge
of the gelatin is no longer neutral, but positive charged in acid
solution. It is well known that AA is an effective denaturant helping
to open up the protein structures and expose protein functional residues.19,23,62 As a result, we expect stronger
gelatin–CB interactions and more gelatin chains on each particle
surface. Therefore, in the AA/DI mixture we study the assembly of
CB particles with three, four, and six gelatin coatings. Figure 4 shows the self-assembled
structures at equilibrium states for each case. As shown, different
from the gelatin/CB in the DI water system, “sheet-like”
structures are formed in AA/DI solution. As the gelatin coating is
increased, the sheet surface becomes larger, thinner, and more curved.

Charge distribution on gelatin side chains in the AA/DI mixture. The
equilibrium distribution of CB particles with (b) 3 gelatin coating,
(c) 4 gelatin coating, and (d) 6 gelatin coating. Water and AA beads
are not shown for clarity.

Simulations demonstrate that the assembly structures of the
CB particles strongly depend on the coating materials and solvent
environments. To further characterize the different structures, we
calculate the RDFs of CB particles for all the cases. The RDF is defined
as , where dn(r) is the ensemble averaged number of particles around a referenced
particle within the volume of a shell from r → r + Δr; ρ = N/V is the number of particles per unit volume; V is the volume of the system and N is
the total number of particles in the system. As shown in Figure 5a, the RDF for PVDF/CB
in NMP is flat, indicating that the particles are well dispersed in
solution and there is no clear assembled structures. However, for
all gelatin/CB systems as clearly shown in Figure 5, the distributions peak at rpeak ≈ 3.8 indicates the accumulation of particles.
For gelatin/CB in DI water, the distribution peak gpeak ≈ 90 is observed when there is only one gelation
coating. When the coating number is increased, the peak value is slightly
decreased to ∼75. For gelatin/CB in the AA/DI mixture, the rpeak values shift slightly to the right, and
the gpeak values are much smaller compared
with the DI water cases. The larger value of rpeak indicates that the particles are more loosely packed,
and the assembled structures outspread more at a smaller value of gpeak. Figure 5b,c illustrate the structural details for the two gelatin/CB
systems. As is shown, in DI water, the “rod-like” strings
are always triple-strand and the CB particles are closely stacked
together. In the AA/DI mixture, the outstretched “sheet-like”
surfaces are mostly formed with single layer loosely packed CB particles.
These structural features are consistent with the corresponding RDF
distributions.

particles for each simulated case. (b) Compact triple-strand “rod-like”
structures formed for gelatin/CB in the case of DI water. (c) Loose
curved “sheet-like” structures formed for gelatin/CB

not shown.

3.4 Solvent
and Charge Effects on Final Self-Assembled Structures
Both
the solution and the redistribution of the charges on gelatin side
chains may contribute to the structural differences for gelatin/CB
systems. To differentiate the effects, we have studied the assembly
of pure CB particles in the DI water and AA/DI mixture. The final
self-assembled structures of bare CB particles in both solutions are
illustrated in Figure 6a. As shown in the inset, large irregular agglomerations were formed
in both solvent conditions. Moreover, both RDF profiles showed similar
peaks at the similar locations (marked by green dashed squares and
denoted as the 1st peak and 2nd peak). The 1st peak in the AA/DI mixture
is slightly shifted to the right because the AA molecules have stronger
attraction with the CB particle (see Table 1). Both RDF profiles and morphologies in Figure 6a indicate that the
self-assembled structures from these two solvent environments are
statistically similar, suggesting that the structural difference is
not because of the interactions from different solvent molecules.
To clarify the effect from the charges, we arbitrarily set the charges
on the side chain of gelatin to zero and re-ran the case for six gelatin-coated
CB particles in the AA/DI mixture. As shown in Figure 6b, all the particles accumulate into a cylindrical
structure. Based on Figure 6, the dominant factor leading to the “sheet-like”
structures is the charge redistribution on the side chains under different
solvent environments.

in solution. (a) RDF of pure CB particles’ self-assembled structures
in water (I) and in the AA/DI mixture (II). Inset shows the structures
at the equilibrium state. (b) Self-assembled structure when charges
on gelatin are set to zero in AA solution. All solvent beads are not
shown.

Our DPD simulations show that
distinctive structures are formed with different coatings in different
solutions. The structures at the solution state will directly impact
the final porous structures at the solid state after evaporation.
Our simulation results show that the PVDF-coated CB particles are
well dispersed in NMP as illustrated in Figure 7a, therefore during evaporation the accumulation
of CB particles is random and uncontrollable (see Figure 7d), in the end large cracks
may appear at different locations (see Figure S1a in Supporting Information). For gelatin-coated CB particles in
DI water, interconnected and closely packed “rod-like”
structures are formed (see Figure 7b). As illustrated in Figure 7e, during the drying process, the rods can
easily break into sticks and randomly stack together. More importantly,
due to the weak interactions between gelatin and CB particles, excessive
amounts of free gelatins are in the solution and become solid blocking
the porous structures after evaporation. As a result, the porosity
is extremely low in this case (∼12% see Figure S1b in Supporting Information). For gelatin-coated CB
particles in the AA/DI mixture, the particles assemble into curved
“sheet-like” structures. These structures are stable
and flexible because of the strong gelatin–gelatin interactions.
It is most likely that those curved sheets will form homogeneous porous
structures (porosity of ∼45% see Figure S1c in the Supporting Information) with large channels as
demonstrated in Figure 7c after evaporation. Additionally, as indicated in Figure 4c,d, the large sheet surfaces
are covered with numerous charges (shown in red color), producing
repelling forces during evaporation, which will further stabilize
the self-assembled structure. As shown in Figure 7f, a well-maintained structure will be obtained
even at a dry state. The homogeneous porous structures with functionalized
surfaces work especially well as an interlayer between the cathode
and the separator in Li–S batteries. As demonstrated by the
simulations and experiments in ref (23), the resulting interlayer provides more pathways
for Li+ transport, and the functionalized surfaces effectively
trap the polysulfides suppressing the “shuttle” effects.

and in dry state (d–f) after evaporation.

4 Conclusions
Our experiments show that
the final porous structures of the CB particles strongly depend on
the coating materials and solvent environment. Coating the CB particles
with gelatin proteins and dispersing them in an AA/DI mixture result
in a homogeneous porous structure with high porosity. The accumulation
of protein-coated particles in solution is a complex and protein-directed
self-assembly process, which involves complicated interactions among
solvent molecules, proteins, and CB particles. Here, we have implemented
the comprehensive DPD simulations to investigate the self-assembly
processes of CB particles with different coatings (PVDF or gelatin)
at different solutions (NMP, DI water, or AA/DI mixture). Our DPD
simulations show that PVDF-coated CB particles are well dispersed
in the organic NMP regardless of the coating density. Gelatin-coated
CB particles result in triple-strand and compact “rod-like”
structures in DI water, while gelatin-coated CB particles in the AA/DI
mixture lead to thin and curved “sheet-like” structures.
The redistribution of the charges on gelatin side chains under different
solvent environments plays key roles in the determination of the assembled
structures. The structures in solution directly impact the final porous
structures after removal of the solvent. The simulation results are
able to reasonably explain the experimental observations. Both simulation
and experiments demonstrate that homogeneous high porosity structures
with functionalized surfaces can be obtained through a protein-directed
self-assembly process under appropriate conditions, and DPD simulations
represents a powerful tool in guiding future experimental design and
optimization. Finally, in DPD coarse graining several atoms into one
bead and grouping intermolecular forces into several short-range forces
make the simulations efficient and especially suitable for study of
mesoscale self-assembling processes. However, due to the coarse graining
the detailed molecular interactions dictating the process cannot be
explicitly explored, and this information can be further investigated
in future work using molecular simulations.
