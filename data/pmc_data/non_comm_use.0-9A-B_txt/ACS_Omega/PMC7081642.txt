The
kinetics of the transesterification of polylactic acid (PLA)
with methanol to form methyl lactate catalyzed by Zn(II) complexes
was studied experimentally and numerically. The complexes, Zn(1Et)2 and Zn(2Pr)2, were synthesized from ethylenediamine
and propylenediamine Schiff bases, respectively. The temperature range
covered was 313.2–383.2 K. An increase in the reaction rate
with the increase in temperature was observed for the Zn(1Et)2-catalyzed reaction. The temperature
relationship of the rate coefficients can be explained by a linear
Arrhenius dependency with constant activation energy. The kinetics
of Zn(2Pr)2, on the
other hand, is only explained by non-Arrhenius kinetics with convex
variable activation energy, resulting in faster methyl lactate production
rates at 323.2 and 343.2 K. The formation of a new catalyst species,
likely through reaction with protic reagents, appears to promote the
formation of intermediate complexes, resulting in the nonlinear behavior.
Stirring speed induced the stability of the intermediate complexes.
Contrary to Zn(1Et)2, Zn(2Pr)2 was susceptible
to the presence of air/moisture in solution. The kinetic parameters
were obtained by fitting the experimental data to the mass and energy
balance of a consecutive second step reversible reaction taking place
in a jacketed stirred batch reactor. For the case of Zn(2Pr)2, the activation energy was
fitted to a four-parameter equation. The kinetic parameters presented
in this work are valuable for the design of processes involving the
chemical recycling of PLA into green solvents.

1 Introduction
Although
polylactic acid (PLA) is a promising material to replace
traditional synthetic polymers in packaging applications,1 its higher cost and low natural degradation rates
have limited its commercial growth.2 Chemical
recycling of PLA is an alternative to mechanical recycling and composting
of postconsumer PLA, resulting in lower production costs and value-added
products.3,4 Chemical recycling methods, including pyrolysis,
hydrolysis, and acid–base depolymerization, have been demonstrated
in the literature;5−12 however, these processes are characterized by high temperatures
(up to 533 K). Milder operating conditions can be achieved by the
catalyzed transesterification reaction of PLA to produce alkyl lactates,
which are considered as green solvents because of their low toxicity
and biodegradability.13,14 Alkyl lactates are considered
as substitutes to oil-derived solvents with applications in polymer
manufacturing, biochemicals, pharmaceuticals, agricultural chemicals,
as well as being platform chemicals, with an estimated market value
of $16,800 million per annum.13−16 For instance, propylene glycol, a monomer in the
production of polyurethanes, can be obtained from the hydrogenation
of methyl lactate (MeLa).15 The potential
to obtain lactide from MeLa has also been demonstrated,17−20 opening the possibility for a circular economy.

A catalyst
is normally employed to reduce the transesterification
reaction temperature with a range of different examples being reported.
Acid/base catalysis for the hydrolysis of PLA has been widely reported;
however, this often requires harsh conditions.21−23 Traditional
acid/base catalysts have been successfully replaced by ionic liquids
for PLA degradation.24 Organocatalysts,
triazabicyclodecene and 4-dimethylaminopyridine, have also been demonstrated
for PLA degradation, having high activity in solution at low temperatures,
as well as being able to polymerize lactide to PLA.12,25,26 The use of commercially available complexes
such as metal catalysts has been assessed at high temperatures (≥373
K).5,27 Sobota and co-workers5 reported a range of alkali and alkaline earth metals, such
as Zn(II), Sn(II), and Al(III), for the alcoholysis of PLA. The addition
of metal species allowed for degradation as low as 353 K. Liu et al.27 have reported the use of Fe(III) chloride as
a catalyst for PLA methanolysis at 403 K. Discrete metal complexes
have also been applied to the alcoholysis of PLA, often in conjunction
with a study into the polymerization of lactide.28−32 Whitelaw et al.32 have
described the use of zirconium/hafnium(IV) salalen complexes for polymerization
and degradation of PLA under mild conditions. Fliedel et al.29 have reported the use of Zn(II) carbene complexes,
also for polymerization and mild degradation reactions.

In a
previous publication,30 the effect
of different operating parameters [PLA molecular weight (Mn), catalyst concentration, PLA particle size, stirring
speed, and temperature] for the degradation of PLA into MeLa by a
Zn(II) complex based on an ethylenediamine Schiff base (Zn(1Et)2, Figure S1) was reported. Statistical analysis showed that the main
variables affecting the reaction are catalyst concentration and temperature
and that the reaction rate is independent of PLA Mn and stirring speed. In a recent development,31 newly synthesized complexes based on propylenediamine
Schiff base (Zn(1Pr)2 and Zn(2Pr)2, Figure S1) showed higher activity than Zn(1Et)2 toward both lactide
polymerization and PLA depolymerization under identical conditions,
showing the potential for a faster process. In this work, temperature-dependent
kinetic parameters for the depolymerization of PLA with Zn(1Et)2 and Zn(2Pr)2 are presented to exhibit the unexpected
and unusual differences in their activity.

2 Experimental
Section
2.1 Materials
2.1.1 Small-Scale
Tests
Methanol (MeOH,
HPLC grade, ≥99.9%) and tetrahydrofuran (THF) (HPLC grade,
inhibitor-free, ≥99.9%) were purchased from VWR and used without
further purification. Argon (≥99.998%) was purchased from BOC.
PLA [VegWare Cup, Mn = 45,000 g mol–1 measured by gel permeation chromatography (GPC)]
was cut into pieces of less than 10 mm2.

2.1.2 Large-Scale Tests
MeOH (HPLC grade,
≥99.9%) and THF (HPLC grade, inhibitor-free, ≥99.9%)
were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used without further purification.
Nitrogen (oxygen-free, ≥99.998%) was purchased from BOC. PLA
sample beads (Ingeo 2500HP and 6202D, Mn = 71,900 and 44,350 g mol–1, respectively, measured
by GPC) were acquired from NatureWorks and used as received unless
stated otherwise. These samples covered a wide range of product applications
including extrusion, thermoforming, and fibers.33 For the experiments at 323 K and below, the beads were
shredded (an RETSCH SR-300 rotor beater) to a fine form of less than
3 mm to aid dissolution.

2.2 Catalyst
Synthesis and Characterization
The preparation and detailed
characterization of catalysts Zn(1Et)2, Zn(1Pr)2, and Zn(2Pr)2 have been reported elsewhere.28,31 A summary of the characterization
and molecular structure is provided
in the Supporting Information (Figure S1
and Table S1). These catalysts were prepared under Ar/Schlenk conditions
and stored under Ar in a glovebox prior to transport and use. The
complexes could be prepared on a multigram scale (Zn(1Et)2, 54 mmol scale, 72%; Zn(1Pr)2, 21 mmol scale, 86%;
and Zn(2Pr)2, 25.5
mmol scale, 74%). Successful synthesis was confirmed by 1H NMR spectroscopy for every batch prepared.

2.3 Apparatus
and Procedures
2.3.1 Small Scale
Reactions were performed
in a sealed J Young’s flask under an Ar atmosphere, which had
previously been dried at 393 K for at least 16 h. The reaction temperature
was controlled using a silicone oil bath, and the reaction mixture
was stirred by a magnetic bar.

In a typical experiment, 0.25
g of PLA was charged to a J Young’s flask and taken into a
glovebox. The catalyst (4 wt %, 10.4 mg) was added under the inert
conditions of the glovebox and 4 mL of THF was added under a flow
of Ar on a Schlenk-like condition. The flask was placed in a preheated
oil bath and stirred (750 rpm) for 10 min to dissolve the polymer.
The reaction time was started when adding 1 mL of MeOH. The progress
of the reaction was monitored by taking aliquots (20 μL) under
an Ar flow. 1H NMR analysis determined the relative molar
concentrations of Internal (Int), chain-end (CE), and MeLa methine
groups as detailed in ref (30) (see Figure S2 for a typical 1H NMR group assignment).

Conversion of Int groups (XInt), MeLa
selectivity (SMeLa), and MeLa yield (YMeLa) were calculated according to 1   2   3  where Int0 is the initial concentration
of the Int groups (100%).

2.3.2 Large Scale
Reactions were performed
in a 300 mL SS316 jacketed stirred batch reactor (PARR model 4566).
The reaction temperature was controlled by an oil bath heating circulator
(Julabo HE) connected to the jacket and a chiller (Julabo GR150) within
0.75 K. A Pt100 sensor calibrated using a three-point calibration
using water as the reference fluid measured the temperature at the
interior of the reactor. A control unit (PARR model 4848) monitored
the stirring speed and pressure.

In a typical experiment, 12.5
g of PLA, 200 mL of THF, and 4 wt % catalyst were charged into the
reactor. The reactor was sealed and the mixture was flushed with N2 for 5 min at room temperature under gentle stirring. Heating
was started and the stirring speed was set to 870 rpm. Once the desired
operating temperature was reached and stabilized, 50 mL of MeOH was
added by an HPLC pump (PerkinElmer 200) at 10 mL min–1. The start of the alcohol addition marked the initial reaction time.
The progress of the reaction was followed by withdrawing samples (1
mL) at different time intervals. MeLa concentration was determined
by a gas chromatograph coupled with a flame-ionization detector (FID),
whereas 1H NMR determined the Int, CE, and MeLa groups.
Reactions were carried out at 323.2, 343.2, 363.2, and 383.2 K to
obtain temperature-dependent kinetic parameters.

2.3.3 Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy
1H NMR analysis was performed on a Bruker 400 MHz or
500 MHz spectrometer. Resonances were referenced to residual solvent
signals. For the preparation of NMR samples of complexes, CDCl3 was distilled and stored over molecular sieves.

2.3.4 Gas Chromatography
Quantitative
analysis of the MeLa concentration was obtained by a gas chromatograph
coupled with a FID (FID, Agilent Technologies, 6890N) equipped with
a 30 m × 0.32 mm internal diameter and 0.25 μm film thickness
capillary column (Agilent HP-5). Sample volumes (1 μL) were
injected with an autosampler (Agilent Technologies, 7693A). The gas
chromatography conditions were as follows: 1:100 split ratio and 423
and 523 K inlet and detector temperature, respectively. An initial
oven temperature of 363 K was held for 4 min, increased to 393 K at
100 K min–1 and held for 1 min, and then increased
to 473 K at 100 K min–1 and held for 2 min. Helium
CP grade, purity ≥ 99.999% (BOC), was used as a carrier and
makeup gas. A linear response (R2 >
0.998)
of the detector was obtained while measuring a multiple point external
standard calibration curve covering the 0–0.073 g mL–1 range. MeLa standard was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.

3 Kinetic Modeling
3.1 Reaction Mechanism
It has been reported that the MeLa formation with Zn(1Et)2, Zn(Zn(1Pr)2, and Zn(2Pr)2 catalysts follows a consecutive reaction
where PLA degrades first into intermediates from which MeLa is formed
through a reversible reaction.30,31 The intermediates are
believed to be composed of oligomers of relatively low molecular weight
with respect to that of the original PLA, and as low as the lactate
dimer. The intermediates are referred here as Oligos. The PLA, Oligos,
and MeLa concentrations are represented by the concentration of Int,
CE, and MeLa methine groups, respectively (Figure 1), and determined by 1H NMR spectroscopy.
The number of moles of PLA, Oligos, and MeLa at any given time can
be calculated from the corresponding 1H NMR concentrations
(mol %) at that time and the initial number of moles of PLA, calculated
from the initial mass of PLA and the molecular weight of the repeat
unit. The concentration of MeLa calculated from 1H NMR
spectroscopy agreed with the gas-chromatograph-determined concentration
to an average absolute error of 0.0025 g mL–1. The
maximum theoretical MeLa concentration for the amount of PLA used
in the experiments corresponds to 0.072 g mL–1.
Nevertheless, because of the reversibility of the reaction, the maximum
concentration observed was around 0.070 g mL–1.

Figure 1 Methine
groups determined by 1H NMR for PLA (Int), Oligos
(CE), and MeLa.

3.2 Mass
and Energy Balance
The mass
balance equations on the batch reactor are 4   5   6  where ri are the rate expressions for the different species given by eqs 7–9, and PLA, Oligos, and MeLa represent the molar concentrations
of the respective species at any given time. 7   8   9  

In eqs 7 and 9, ki are the rate coefficients, and the concentration
equilibrium constant, Ke = k2/k–2, is defined with
respect to MeLa. The initial conditions for the set of ordinary differential
equations (eqs 4–6) are PLA = PLA0, Oligos = 0, and MeLa
= 0, where PLA0 is the initial molar concentration of PLA
in the system.

The energy balance equation on the SS316 batch
reactor is 10  where
ΔHij(T) is the enthalpy of reaction
for the jth reaction, rij corresponds to the reaction rate expression for
the ith component, and Ci and CPi are the concentration and heat capacity
of the ith component, respectively.

The overall
heat-transfer coefficient, U, and
the heat-transfer area, A, have been estimated as
240 J s–1 m–2 K–1 and 0.0177 m–2 (see the Supporting Information). Ta is the temperature
of the heat-transfer fluid whose properties are presented in Table S2. The main contributions to the heat
capacity are assumed to be only those given by MeOH and THF. The average CP was computed from a reference
temperature and the current temperature, T. The CP at any given temperature
was calculated from a cubic function (eq 11) where A, B, C, and D are compound-specific
coefficients (Table S3). 11  

The temperature-dependent form of Ke in eq 9 is given by
the van’t Hoff equation34 12  where R is the ideal gas
constant. In solving eqs 10 and 12, the change in heat capacity
over the temperature range studied has been neglected (i.e., ΔCP = 0).

The temperature-dependent
form of the rate coefficients was calculated
using the empirical Arrhenius equation (eq 13) from which activation energies (Ea) can be readily obtained if no other thermodynamic
properties are required (i.e., as is the case of the Eyring model). A in eq 13 is defined as the pre-exponential factor. 13  

Parameters ΔH1, A, and Ea were calculated using the parameter
estimation module of gPROMS ModelBuilder,35 which uses the maximum likelihood estimation method.35,36

4 Results and Discussion
4.1 Catalyst
Stability
The stability
of Zn(1Et)2 toward
moisture/oxygen in the solid state and in solution with lactide, PLA,
MeOH, and MeLa has been demonstrated previously.28,30 Zn(1Et)2 has also
been shown to remain intact under transesterification reaction conditions.31 Both (Zn(1Pr)2 and Zn(2Pr)2 were previously shown to dissociate a ligand under these
conditions and form a new active species. The stability of these complexes
was therefore further assessed. Zn(1Pr)2 was found to be more air-/moisture–sensitive,
showing evidence (via 1H NMR spectroscopy) of degradation
when stored in solution or in solid state. In comparison, Zn(2Pr)2 was more stable under
ambient conditions, experiencing only 2% of complex decomposition
to ligand after 10 d in air (Figure S3).
However, in solution (d8-THF), more degradation
is observed (≤10%) even under an inert atmosphere. The formation
of any other ligated zinc species was not observed under these conditions,
suggesting that the formation of previously detected species is favored
only under reaction conditions. These differences in stability likely
resulted in the higher activities observed for Zn(2Pr)2 in the scale-up tests, differing
with the preliminary findings at the small scale.31 Furthermore, Zn(2Pr)2 was found to be active for the degradation of PLA in
air at the small scale, achieving comparable results to that of an
inert atmosphere (323 K, 1 h, XInt = 100%; YMeLa = 89%). However, because of the known catalyst
decomposition, further small-scale studies were performed under Ar
to ensure reproducibility.

At 363.2 K, for instance, similar
initial degradation rates are obtained with all catalysts, being just
slightly higher for Zn(2Pr)2, as shown in the values for the rate coefficients (Table 1). After 1 h of reaction,
there are no major differences between the achieved yield with all
catalysts (Table 1, Figure 2); however, as the
reaction progresses, the differences become evident. After 5 h, the
yield achieved by Zn(2Pr)2 is higher than those of Zn(1Pr)2 and Zn(1Et)2. The formation of lactate is favored by Zn(2Pr)2 as shown by the lower rate
coefficient, k–2, for the reverse
reaction. In contrast, the reformation of intermediates from the lactate
is favored by Zn(1Et)2, resulting in a lower MeLa formation rate.

catalysts at 363.2 K for the scale-up
studies.

Although
Zn(2Pr)2 was less
susceptible to the presence of oxygen/moisture, the reaction
protocol was modified to include 20 min of N2 purging to
achieve an inert atmosphere inside the reactor and to aid reproducibility
of the experiments. The rest of the study was focused only on the
more stable and active Zn(2Pr)2.

4.2 Effect of Stirring Speed
Previous
studies with Zn(1Et)2 showed that this catalyst does not present mass-transfer limitations
when testing two different stirring speeds (300 and 700 rpm) and two
particle sizes (3 and 5 mm); although at low temperatures, the solubility
of PLA in the medium has to be considered.30 Nonetheless, two control experiments, one at 300 rpm and one at
700 rpm in air, were performed. The MeLa concentration profiles for
both experiments were similar, validating the previous conclusions.

In contrast to this, testing of 700 and 870 rpm (the latter is
the maximum value achieved with the current setup) on the more stable
Zn(2Pr)2 showed a
direct correlation of this operating parameter with the activity of
the catalyst (Figure 3). At 300 rpm, the activity of Zn(2Pr)2 was in fact lower than that of Zn(1Et)2, but an increase in activity
was attained when increasing the stirring speed.

Figure 3 Effect of stirring speed
on Zn(2Pr)2 activity
for the scale-up studies at 383.2 K.

4.3 Effect of Temperature and Molecular Weight
The effect of temperature on reaction rate was studied by performing
experiments with the two molecular weight samples at 323.2, 343.2,
363.2, and 383.2 K (with corresponding gauge pressures of 0, 3, 130,
and 330 kPa, respectively) in the 316SS batch reactor. Similar to
the findings for Zn(1Et)2,30 the transesterification reaction
catalyzed by Zn(2Pr)2 proceeded at the same rate regardless of PLA molecular weight (see
for instance, Figure S4).

A clear
increase in activity by the increase in temperature was observed for
Zn(1Et)2 as seen in
the conversion, selectivity, and yield at 60 min (Figure 4). Conversely, higher activities
were noted at lower temperatures with Zn(2Pr)2, becoming similar to Zn(1Et)2 at higher temperatures (Figure 4).

Figure 4 Conversion (■),
selectivity (●), and yield (▲)
at 60 min with Zn(1Et)2 and Zn(2Pr)2.

A plot of the reaction profiles for Zn(2Pr)2 at the different temperatures
studied
provide a more insightful trend (Figure 5). The results include experiments with both
PLA molecular weight samples. The reaction is faster at 323.2 K, with
the activity decreasing with the increase of temperature, reaching
a minimum around 363.2 K and then increasing again with the increase
in temperature. This effect cannot be attributed to thermal catalyst
decomposition in solution because the catalyst showed higher activity
at 383.2 K than at 363.2 K. An additional experiment at 303.2 K showed
a low initial reaction rate of 8 × 10–6 g mL–1 min–1, which is the slowest rate
observed for this reaction.

Figure 5 Effect of temperature on reaction rate with
Zn(2Pr)2. Plots include
results with both
PLA Mn.

Between 313.2 and 343.2 K, the conversion, selectivity, and yield
are in general in good agreement between the small and scale-up studies
(Table 2). Superior
activities at the small scale can be expected because of better mixing.
A constraint on the maximum attainable reaction temperature exists
at the small scale because the system operates at atmospheric pressure.
343.2 K was the maximum temperature studied before witnessing boiling
of the liquid mixture.

Reactions showing higher
reaction rates at lower temperatures (i.e.,
negative Ea) are indicative of an intermediate-complex
formation in a multistep reaction.37−42 Nevertheless, the noteworthy observation in the present reaction
is the curved Ea (to be detailed in Section 4.4), where starting
from a relatively high temperature, the magnitude of the reaction
rate coefficient decreases as temperature decreases up to a certain
minimum, which then increases by decreasing the temperature further.
This phenomenon has been explained to be characteristic of a system
in which formation and redissociation of an initial weak complex takes
place, followed by crossing of a small energy barrier to form the
product.43,44

Based on the preliminary studies on
Zn(2Pr)2,31 it is
hypothesized that a new species is formed by the loss of one of the
ligands of the catalyst through reaction with protic reagents at some
temperature above 303.2 K. Once this new heteroleptic catalyst species
is formed, it induces the formation of the short-lived intermediate
complex at the different reaction steps. Because the PLA transesterification
by Zn(2Pr)2 involves
consecutive steps with an equilibrium step, the overall reaction will
be faster or slower depending on whether the temperature will promote
the initial degradation step or the forward or reverse consecutive
reaction.45

Stirring appears to induce
the stabilization of the weak initial
complex, therefore resulting in improved activities at higher stirring
speeds; a similar effect to the pressure dependence of reaction rate
due to collisional stabilization of the complex in gas-phase reactions
shows negative activation energies and strongly curved Arrhenius plots.42

4.4 Kinetic Modeling
The enthalpy of
reaction and the Arrhenius parameters for the degradation step were
estimated as ΔH1 = 375 ± 69
kJ mol–1, A1 = 5962
± 7 min–1, and Ea1 = 37.89 ± 0.03 kJ mol–1 (confidence
intervals at 95%). The Ke at the different
temperatures can be calculated from the integrated form of the van’t
Hoff equation, eq 12, as follows 14  

Equation 14 contains the value
of enthalpy of reaction
(ΔH2 = 2.40 ± 0.3 kJ mol–1 with respect to MeLa), computed from the slope of
ln(Ke) versus 1/T (Figure S5) from the fitted parameters for k2 and k–2 (Table S4). The reaction rate coefficients
for Zn(1Et)2 show
a linear dependency with temperature (Figure S6), with constant positive activation energy (Ea2 = 39.6 kJ mol–1 and Ea–2 = 37.2 kJ mol–1).

In contrast to Zn(1Et)2, the system with Zn(2Pr)2 depicted a nonlinear relationship when plotting
ln(k) versus (1/T) (Figures 6 and S7); therefore,
it is classified as exhibiting a curved Arrhenius plot with variable
(temperature-dependent) Ea.39,42,45−48 In Figures 6 and S7, additional
experiments at 313.2, 333.2, 353.2, and 373.2 K are included.

Figure 6 Curved Arrhenius
plot for the rate coefficient of the degradation
step and corresponding variable activation energy (inset) given by eq 16.

Variable Ea was recognized in the 1900s45,47,49 and was widely studied by Perlmutter-Hayman48 who presented a comprehensive analysis of the
phenomenon and the inherent thermodynamic processes. Several examples
can be found in the literature displaying curved Arrhenius plots.43,45−57 The reaction media plays an important part on the non-Arrhenius
behavior; therefore, it is more commonly observed in complex liquid-phase
reactions, particularly those involving solvolysis reactions.48,58 A few unimolecular gas-phase reactions, however, have been shown
to follow non-Arrhenius kinetics.39,45

The
variation of the rate coefficients with temperature was adjusted
to a four-parameter equation (eq 15) of the type proposed by Hyne and Robertson.59 The consequent Ea (Figure 6) is then
given by eq 16. The
relationship of the parameters in eq 15 with thermodynamic properties of activation (standard
entropies, enthalpies, and heat capacities) has been detailed by Perlmutter-Hayman.48 The estimated values (Table 3) are only valid on the temperature range
studied,58 that is, 313.2–383.2
K. 15   16

Contrary to what would be expected,
the PLA degradation step was
favored at low temperatures (below 343.2 K); in fact, the model reveals
a minimum Ea1 = −53
kJ mol–1 at 348.6 K (Figure 6). Equation 15 implies a linear relationship of the heat capacity
of activation (ΔCP⧧), defined as
the standard heat capacity change associated with the activation process,
with temperature according to58 17  

It is worth
mentioning that ΔCP⧧ is neglected
in the Arrhenius equation model,45,61 which is the
case for Zn(1Et)2.

The MeLa formation from the intermediates was faster at 323.2 K.
The data show a decrease in the rate coefficient with an increase
in temperature. The model indicates an inflection point of 347.9 K
and a minimum at 368.0 K, from which the reaction rate then increases
with the increase in temperature. The reverse reaction is also favored
at low temperatures, and the rate coefficients are 1 order of magnitude
smaller at 383.2 K compared with 323.2 K, with Ea2 shifting from positive to negative at 358.1 K.
The average activation energies for the temperature range studied
are Ea1 = −5.7 kJ mol–1, Ea2 = 10.5
kJ mol–1, and Ea3 = −17.1 kJ mol–1, noticeably lower
than the values for Zn(1Et)2.

The higher activity of Zn(2Pr)2 over Zn(1Et)2 at the low temperatures can be appreciated in
the magnitudes
of the rate coefficients. For instance, at 343.2 K, the rate coefficients
for Zn(2Pr)2 are 1
order of magnitude higher than those of Zn(1Et)2 (k1 = 0.112
min–1, k2 = 0.0439 min–1, k–2 = 0.00584
min–1 vs k1 = 0.0102
min–1, k2 = 0.0044 min–1, and k–2 = 0.00093
min–1). Figure 7 displays the reaction profiles at this condition with
both catalysts.

Figure 7 Reaction profiles at 343.2 K, catalyzed by (a) Zn(1Et)2 and (b) Zn(2Pr)2.

An interesting observation during the experimental studies with
Zn(2Pr)2 was that
the aliquots for the experiments at 343.2 K and below continued reacting
even when stored at 253.2 K, in air, without stirring. The concentration
of MeLa for the initial samples almost doubled in around 72 h.

To confirm these observations, a small-scale experiment was performed
for both Zn(2Pr)2 and
Zn(1Et)2. To reach
a similar starting concentration of products, transesterification
was performed at 323.2 K for 15 min and 4.5 h, respectively, and this
was confirmed by 1H NMR analysis. The aliquots were then
kept at 253.2 K, in air, and their concentrations were measured after
60 min and 72 h. The concentration of MeLa for the Zn(2Pr)2 sample increased by 67% in
72 h, compared to only 7% for the Zn(1Et)2 case (Figures 8 and S8). Remarkably, the
main factor contributing to the increase in alkyl lactate concentration
for the Zn(2Pr)2 case
is the significant degradation of PLA to intermediates. For Zn(1Et)2, there were no further
signs of polymer degradation and the only contribution to the increase
in lactate concentration was due to the existing amount of intermediates.
An additional local maxima of the degradation rate coefficient may
exist below 313 K, but the new active catalytic species has to be
created first at some temperature above 303 K.

spectra and corresponding concentrations from the Zn(2Pr)2 degradation tests at 253.2
K.

Reaction media conditions, including
solvent type and temperature
range, are important parameters in the observation of variable Ea.39 Given that the
only difference between the reactions catalyzed by Zn(1Et)2 and Zn(2Pr)2 was the catalyst itself, the observation
of variable Ea can be attributed to a
lowering of the activation energy threshold by different complex mechanisms,
including alternative reaction paths, consecutive steps, pre-equilibria,
and tunneling.45,48,58,62

5 Conclusions
The kinetics of the chemical degradation of PLA to form MeLa by
two Zn(II) complexes were studied experimentally and numerically.
The reaction mechanism with both catalysts can be explained by a consecutive
reaction with the reversible second step. Similarly, the reaction
rate for both catalysts was found to be independent of polymer molecular
weight, an important aspect for the industrial application of the
chemical recycling of PLA of varying molecular weight.

The Zn
complex from the ethylenediamine Schiff base did not show
mass-transfer limitations and is not susceptible to the presence of
oxygen and or moisture either in the solid state or in solution. The
rate coefficients for the catalyzed reaction follow the linear temperature-dependent
model given by the Arrhenius equation with constant positive activation
energy.

The propylenediamine Schiff base Zn complex on the other
hand is
more susceptible to the presence of oxygen and or moisture when in
solution but not in the solid state. The catalyzed reaction exhibits
non-Arrhenius behavior with variable activation energy, resulting
in faster MeLa production rates at low temperatures. While PLA starts
degrading at some temperature above 303.2 K, the optimum temperature
is found to be 348.6 K. Once the oligomers are formed, the reaction
proceeds faster at lower temperatures. MeLa formation was observed
even at subzero temperatures mainly driven by the ongoing PLA degradation.

The variable activation energy of the reaction catalyzed by Zn(2Pr)2 is attributed to
the formation of a new species by the dissociation of one ligand through
reaction with protic reagents above 303.2 K, which induces the formation
of an intermediate catalyst complex and to the reaction mechanism
involving a consecutive reaction as well as reaction media. The system
also shows collision stability as determined by the effect of stirring
speed on reaction rate. Nevertheless, the activities of both catalysts
tend to become similar at high temperatures.

The temperature-dependent
kinetic parameters presented in this
work are valuable for engineering design of processes for the degradation
of PLA by Zn(II) complexes. An optimum design for the formation of
MeLa from the degradation of PLA could involve the use of Zn(2Pr)2 where the polymer
is initially degraded at around 348 K then followed by a reaction
at lower temperature (possibly room temperature) where MeLa is rapidly
formed.
