Bio-based poly(butylene succinate) (BioPBS) was combined
with pyrolyzed Miscanthus microparticles (biocarbon)
and graphene nanoplatelets
to create a hybrid bionanocomposite. Pyrolyzed biomass, known as biocarbon,
was incorporated into a BioPBS matrix to improve the thermo-mechanical
properties of the bioplastic while simultaneously increasing the value
of this co-product. Biocomposites loaded with 25 wt % biocarbon showed
57, 13, and 32% improvements in tensile modulus, heat deflection temperature,
and thermal expansion, respectively. Further improvements were found
when graphene nanoplatelets (GnPs) were added to the biocomposite,
forming a hierarchical hybrid bionanocomposite. Two processing methods
were used to incorporate graphene into the composites: (I) graphene,
BioPBS, and biocarbon were added together and directly compounded,
and (II) a masterbatch of graphene and BioPBS was processed first
and then diluted to the same ratios as those used in the direct compounding
method I. The two methods resulted in different internal morphologies
that subsequently impacted the mechanical properties of the composites;
little change was observed in the thermal properties studied. Bionanocomposites
processed using the direct compounding technique showed the greatest
increase in tensile strength and modulus: 17 and 120%, respectively.
Bionanocomposites processed using a masterbatch technique had slightly
lower strength and modulus but showed almost twice the impact strength
compared with the direct compounding method. This masterbatch technique
was found to have a superior balance of stiffness and toughness, likely
due to the presence of superclustered graphene platelets, confirmed
through a scanning electron microscope and a transmission electron
microscope.

Introduction
Polymers are dominating the material landscape
across the world,
owing in part to their low density, low cost, and easy formability.
However, it is estimated that future consumption will grow rapidly
in developing countries; even small increases of per capita of plastic
consumption will translate into a large increase in plastic usage.1 Recently, biodegradable aliphatic polyesters
have seen a surge in popularity across a number of industries.2 Poly(butylene succinate) (PBS) is produced by
the esterification of succinic acid with 1,4-butanediol. The current
industrial process utilizes approximately 54% bio-based content in
the production of PBS in the form of bio-succinic acid.3,4 However, with further industrialization, bio-succinic acid can be
used to produce 1,4-butanediol,5 which
would lead to 100% bio-based PBS (BioPBS).

Charred biomass,
referred to as biocarbon (BC) or biochar, is one
of the three main products produced from the pyrolysis of biomass.6,7 Biocarbon has been traditionally used as a carbon sink or soil amendment.8,9 More recently biocarbon has been used as a bio-filler for composite
applications.7,8,10,11 In composite applications, it is advantageous
to have both surface functionality and high surface area to create
blends with good thermo-mechanical properties; therefore, pyrolysis
conditions are very important when creating biocarbon. Research has
shown that using high- and low-temperature biocarbon in toughened
polypropylene composites resulted in drastically different mechanical
properties.12 High-temperature pyrolysis
(∼900 °C) resulted in a stiffer biocarbon compared to
low-temperature biocarbon (∼500 °C); this increased stiffness
resulted in a stiffer composite.12 High-temperature
biocarbon also resulted in tougher (measured through impact strength)
composites; this was attributed to the better affinity between biocarbon
and the matrix.12 Researchers found the
opposite trend when high- and low-temperature biocarbon was added
to a polyamide 6 matrix.10 In this case,
the higher functionality of the low-temperature biocarbon was attributed
to the increased tensile and flexural strengths observed in the composites.10 These studies emphasize the differences between
both the biocarbon filler used and the matrix in which they are reinforced,
demonstrating a wide variety of thermo-mechanical properties, dependent
on both the filler and the matrix.

Structure–property
relations and the processing steps that
result in this structure have led to large breadth of knowledge in
composite polymeric materials. However, the addition of nanomaterials
such as graphene, carbon nanotubes, nanofibers, and nanoclays has
further widened this field.13 Graphene,
specifically graphene nanoplatelets (GnP), is a nanoscale platelet
of multiple graphene sheets (a single graphene sheet is roughly 4
nm thick)14 with a thickness between 0.34
and 100 nm.15 Graphene is one of the strongest
materials known, with an intrinsic tensile strength of 130.5 GPa and
a Young’s modulus of 1 TPa.16 The
addition of graphene to polymeric matrices, not surprisingly, leads
to great improvement in stiffness and strength,17−20 likely due to a mixture of high
aspect ratio particles, alignment during processing and deformation,
and the preferment of strain-induced crystallization.21 However, for these properties to be fully taken advantage
of graphene must be evenly dispersed and well distributed within the
polymer matrix. Research has shown that the orientation of the graphene
also affects the composites’ stiffness and thermal properties.22 Proper distribution and orientation is not easily
obtained due to graphene nanoplatelets (GnPs’) large surface
area, van der Waals forces (which hold the sheets together),23 and low solubility in organic solvents and polymer
melts,23 resulting in low levels of dispersion
and exfoliation when using conventional manufacturing processes like
solution or melt blending.24 Many advanced
techniques have shown excellent levels of dispersion including ultrasound-assisted
extrusion,25 addition of surfactants26 or functionalized groups,17 water,27 or supercritical CO2,28 and in situ polymerization.29

Melt mixing or melt compounding is a process
in which a polymer
and filler are compounded together in a high shear environment,18 conventionally done in an extruder. Compared
to solution mixing, which requires the use of solvents, melt mixing
is more economical,18 more environment
friendly, and does not require a distinct processing line in a manufacturing
setting.30 However, to date, the literature
suggests that melt mixing does not provide the same level of dispersion
as the previously mentioned advanced methods.30,31

In the production of polymer nanocomposites, Dennis et al.32 showed that an increase in the residence time
during compounding promotes exfoliation, but an excessive amount of
shear or back mixing causes poor dispersion. Back mixing occurs when
the compounded mixture reaches the end of the extruder and is reintroduced
to the beginning of the extruder for further compounding. This is
commonly used in microcompounders to simulate the longer extrusion
lines present in manufacturing processes. Back mixing will be present
in this study. Villmow et al.33 also showed
that the residence time and throughput had an effect on the dispersion
of a carbon nanotubes masterbatch in a polycaprolactone matrix. They
found that an increase in throughput, which corresponds to a decrease
in residence time and less shear, resulted in worse dispersion and
poor electrical properties33 when compared
to a slower throughput. Most researchers agree that composites with
well-dispersed exfoliated structures ultimately have better properties.18,34 However, significant improvements are not observed in every system,
including nanoclay35 and GnP systems.36 Gong et al.36 showed
that multilayer graphene was superior to single-layer graphene in
reinforcing epoxy systems.

In this study, BioPBS, BC, and graphene
were melt compounded, extruded,
and injection molded to create hybrid bionanocomposites with superior
thermo-mechanical properties compared to the neat matrix. To the best
of the author’s knowledge, to date, there has been no research
on the hybridization of biocarbon and graphene for composite applications.
Graphene was added to the composites using two different processing
methods to compare the relationship between processing conditions
and the resulting properties: (I) a masterbatch technique where 25
wt % of GnPs was first compounded with BioPBS, extruded, and dried.
The masterbatch was then diluted with BioPBS and re-compounded with
BC to create the desired blend ratios. (II) A direct compounding technique
where BioPBS, BC, and GnPs were mixed together and compounded directly.
The process–structure and property relationships were explored
through tensile and flexural properties, impact strength, morphology,
rheology, and thermo-dimensional properties. The two different processes
used could have affected the dispersion and distribution of graphene
within the matrix, which resulted in different thermo-mechanical properties.

Results and Discussion
Mechanical Properties of Biocarbon basedReinforced BioPBS
Biocomposites
The mechanical properties of a material, specifically
the strength, stiffness, and toughness, are crucial to determine which
application the material will be used in. These properties are influenced
by a few parameters, namely, particle size, the particle matrix interaction,
and particle loading (amount of particles).37 An increase in tensile and flexural properties is observed when
BioPBS is reinforced with biocarbon, observed in red in Figure 1a,b. An increase in strength
suggests good interfacial adhesion between the BioPBS matrix and the
particulate filler and that the particles are able to carry load within
the composite.12 This is highly dependent
on effective stress transfer between the matrix and filler.38 The higher modulus of biocarbon compared to
the BioPBS matrix is attributed to the increase in the composite’s
stiffness.39 It can be seen that the flexural
strength of the neat BioPBS was lower than the tensile strength: 34.15
MPa compared to 41.5 MPa. However, after the addition of biocarbon
to the matrix, the composite’s flexural strength increased
by 59%, while the composite’s tensile strength increased by
6%. This suggests that the biocarbon reinforcement is not uniaxial
in nature. Flexural strength accounts for not only the tensile stresses
within a material but also the compressive stresses.40 For this reason, flexural strength values are normally
higher than tensile strength and are also more characteristic of everyday
applied stress.40

and (H, I) BioPBS/BC/GnP (DC) (75/24/1) and (75/20/5), respectively.

Impact toughness corresponds to the energy absorbed
by the material
before failure. Biocarbon reinforcement also improved the toughness
of the biocomposite, measured through impact strength, seen in Figure 1c. There is often
a trade-off between strength and toughness in composites and a simultaneous
increase is often not observed.6,41 Impact toughness is
dependent on many factors and is a highly complicated mechanism that
is often misrepresented.42 Generally, impact
toughness in filler-reinforced composites can be attributed to the
size of the filler, the orientation and distribution of the filler,
and the adhesion between the filler and matrix.40 To improve toughness, the energy needs to be effectively
transferred to the filler, enabling it to absorb said energy.40 During fracture, the crack propagates through
the matrix and it is momentarily stopped, known as crack pinning,
due to the heterogeneity of the filler.38 If there is good adhesion between the filler and the matrix, some
of the crack energy will be transferred to the filler, leading to
a tougher composite.42 Impact toughness
normally decreases when fillers are added;6,43 however,
it was found that the size of the filler has a large effect on the
impact toughness of the composite, where smaller particles increase
impact toughness.37

As shown in Figure 1c, the initial loadings
of biocarbon into the BioPBS matrix resulted
in increased impact strength, up until 20 wt % loading. However, above
this level (25 wt %), the impact strength decreased below that of
the neat BioPBS. Kumar et al.44 found that
initial loading of fillers (up to 7.5% aluminum cenospheres) increased
impact strength, but further loading (10%) resulted in lower impact
strength. Lange and Radford45 similarly
showed an epoxy–alumina trihydrate system in which the fracture
energy across several sizes of alumina trihydrate particles also peaked
at a certain volume fraction and decreased after that. The decrease
in fracture energy after the peak is attributed to the fact that the
particles are packed too closely to effectively interact with the
propagating crack, reducing the effects of crack pinning.45

Mechanical Properties of Hybrid Bionanocomposites
Graphene
was compounded into the composites in two different ways; this resulted
in different tensile, flexural, and impact properties. Regardless
of the way the graphene was compounded into the composites, the addition
of graphene drastically increased the tensile and flexural properties
of the composites. This was attributed to the high strength and stiffness
of graphene.16 Researchers have shown that
property improvement is highly dependent on processing conditions
and morphology.21 However, high levels
of dispersion are hard to achieve in graphene composite systems.24 The main differences in the two processes used,
masterbatch (MB) and direct compounding (DC), were the increased total
residence time (4 min) and initial graphene loading (25 wt %) of the
MB technique. The major mechanical differences between the two compounding
methods were the increased strength and stiffness seen in the DC method
and the increased toughness (impact strength) seen in the MB method,
MB shown in green and DC in blue in Figure 1.

Researchers found that increasing
the mixing duration of compounding, equivalent to an increase in residence
time in a microcompounder, almost doubled the dispersion levels of
fibers from 14 to 30%.46 This was not observed
in this study; this could be for several reasons. First, the initial
loading of graphene in the MB was relatively high (25 wt %) compared
to DC blends, which led to the formation of superclustered graphene
domains. Second, GnPs display a much higher affinity to one another
than fibers,47,48 leading to less dispersion. However,
some researchers have shown that aggregation of fillers is actually
beneficial in the reinforcing composites,49,50 claiming that a certain level of structural hierarchy may be needed
to achieve the full reinforcement potential of graphene.49,50 This hierarchical structure is achieved in the MB composites through
the addition of larger biocarbon particles, the graphene superclusters,
as well as the smaller graphene domains. Reinforcement through aggregation
is observed in this study, through the marked increase in impact strength.
Superclusters of graphene were observed in the MB compounded composites,
which are most likely responsible for the increased impact strength.
Differences are also observed in the complex viscosity seen in rheological
properties as discussed later.

Statistical Analysis
To determine if there was a significant
difference between the two processing methods used, as well as the
amount of graphene present in the composite, a 22 factorial
design was performed on impact and tensile strength. Analysis of variance
(ANOVA) was performed on the 22 factorial design.

A summary of the analysis can be seen in Table 1; full ANOVA results can be seen in Tables S2 and S3 in the supporting information.
At a 95% confidence level, there is a significant difference, observed
for both the processing method used and the amount of graphene added.
It is interesting to note that there is a significant interaction
effect between the processing method used and the amount of graphene
added for impact strength only. The difference between F and Fcrit is also much larger for impact
strength relative to tensile strength; P-values for
impact strength are also much lower compared to tensile strength.
This suggests that both factors have a more significant effect on
the impact strength of the blends compared to the tensile strength.

Morphological Investigation of the Bionanocomposites
The morphology of the composites was observed through scanning electron
microscopy (SEM) images of the impact fracture surface. Researchers
have shown that it is possible to distinguish, based on contrast,
between different qualities of carbon due to their intrinsic differences
in conductivity.51 This principle was used
in this study to differentiate between graphene and biocarbon, circled
in blue and red, respectively, in Figures 2 and 3. The levels
of dispersion of graphene throughout the matrix are clearly different
between the DC composites (Figure 2) and MB composites (Figure 3). Although no quantitative analysis was
conducted on the levels of dispersion, it is apparent that superclusters
of graphene have formed in the MB blends, while they are not apparent
in the DC blends. These superclusters were formed in the initial MB
process, observed in Figure 4. These superclusters were reduced in size and dispersed substantially,
more so in the 1% graphene MB composites (Figure 3c,d) compared to the 5% graphene MB composites
(Figure 3a,b). It is
known that the orientation of GnP and other high aspect ratio particulates
has a significant effect on both the mechanical and gas barrier properties.52 Well-orientated particles, which are orientated
in the same direction, often flow induced, show increased mechanical
properties in a parallel direction and increased barrier properties
in a perpendicular direction.52 This is
observed to a slight degree locally but not in the overall morphology
of the composites; this infers that there was some degree of flow-induced
orientation during the extrusion process.24

Biocarbon particles show good levels of adhesion
to the surrounding
matrix, as there is no particle pullout observed after impact testing.37 Graphene is also observed on the surface of
biocarbon particles (Figure 5), which could also assist in adhering to the BioPBS matrix.

Some degree of dispersion is observed in the higher
magnification
images of both DC and MB blends. It is interesting to note that in
the 25 wt % graphene-loaded masterbatch, there is no dispersion within
the supercluster domains (Figure 4a–c), suggesting that higher loading of graphene
restricts dispersion.

Transmission electron microscopy (TEM)
was used to further investigate
the dispersion and intercalation of the graphene within the 5% MB
blend. TEM revealed the structure of the superclustered graphene surrounded
by the polymer matrix. The superclusters are likely made of stacked
graphene platelets that have agglomerated during the extrusion process.53 In Figure 6, individual GnPs can be distinguished on the surface
of the graphene aggregate, circled in blue. These platelets correspond
in size with the graphene manufacturer specifications. As seen in
the SEM images of the MB blends (Figures 3a,b and 4), the local
area surrounding the graphene aggregate (within the supercluster)
shows no evidence of dispersion or intercalation of the GnPs.

a GnP aggregate surrounded by BioPBS matrix in the
BioPBS/BC/GnP (75/20/5) MB blend.

Rheological Behavior
The flow behavior of polymer melts
is of great interest to manufacturers of polymers and composites.
It is important to understand the rheological behavior, as the resulting
material is affected by the processing environment.23 All polymer blends showed signs of shear thinning (non-Newtonian
behavior), a drop in complex viscosity associated with increased shear
rates. This shear thinning is most dramatic in the DC blends, shown
in blue in Figure 7. The addition of biocarbon to the BioPBS matrix increased both the
complex and zero shear viscosities, while lowering the melt flow index
(MFI) of the composites (Figures 7 and S1). Typically, the
addition of filler to a polymer matrix increases the complex viscosity
and the storage modulus of the samples due to the strong filler networks,
particularly above the critical filler concentration.54 The increased complex viscosity of BioPBS/BC composites
reflects the good dispersion of the biocarbon in the matrix and a
strong filler–filler interaction with BioPBS chains. Moreover,
the MFI of the BioPBS with 25% BC composite was higher than 10 g/10
min, which was still within acceptable limits for processing. The
addition of 1% graphene did not have an outward effect on any of the
rheological measurements, except in the DC composite systems where
increased shear thinning is observed in the higher frequency domains
of complex viscosity. It is interesting that in the DC 1% graphene
composites, the zero shear viscosity decreased, while MFI increased
compared to 25% BC and 1% MB composites, seen in Figure S1.

Figure 7 Complex Viscosity of BioPBS Composites.

Flow can have a large effect on the viscoelastic
properties of
polymer melts filled with anisotropic nanoparticles.55,56 The large shear strain from the induced flow can orientate the particles
in the direction of flow, subsequently reducing viscosity.24 The shear thinning observed in DC composites
compared to MB composites could be attributed to this phenomenon.
The shear thinning observed in DC composites agrees with the observed
increase in dispersion of DC composites compared to MB composites.
All composites showed increased viscosity and decreased MFI compared
to the BioPBS matrix, Figure S1. However,
they are still within acceptable ranges for extrusion and injection
molding manufacturing processes.

Thermo-Dimensional Properties
One of the main drawbacks
of polymers are their high coefficient of linear thermal expansions
(CLTEs) and low heat deflection temperature (HDT), which can be undesirable
for many applications where materials are exposed to elevated levels
of heat.37 CLTE is a measure of dimensional
expansion in response to changes in heat and is calculated by the
expanded thickness divided by the initial thickness: (α –
α0)/α0.37 A low CLTE and a high HDT are indicative of greater thermo-dimensional
stability.57 Combining polymers with more
thermally stable materials has become a common strategy to increase
their thermal stability. Biocarbon and nanofillers like GnPs have
been shown to be effective at reducing thermal expansion.37,58

The CLTE of all composites were lower than that of the neat
BioPBS matrix, Figure 8. However, the most evident reduction (32%) in CLTE was observed
in the composites reinforced with 25% biocarbon content. Statistical
analyses of CLTE measurements are available in the supporting information, Table S4. BC and nanofillers like GnPs have been
shown to be effective at reducing thermal expansion.36,57,61 Ahmad et al.59 showed that the shape of silica particles in an epoxy matrix
had a slight impact on the CLTE of the composite. Further, angular
shapes, containing many sharp edges, and elongated shaped silica particles
showed lower CLTE values compared to the same-sized cubic particles.59 It would then follow that the irregular shape
of biocarbon is an advantageous property in reducing the CLTE of polymer
composites.

Figure 8 Thermo-dimensional properties, specifically, HDT and CLTE (flow
direction) of BioPBS composites, where (A) BioPBS, (B) BioPBS/BC (90/10),
(C) BioPBS/BC (85/15), (D) BioPBS/BC (80/20), (E) BioPBS/BC (75/25),
(F, G) BioPBS/BC/GnP (MB) (75/24/1) and (75/20/5), respectively, and
(H, I) BioPBS/BC/GnP (DC) (75/24/1) and (75/20/5), respectively.

The HDT is another important thermo-dimensional
property; a high
HDT is indicative of high thermo-dimensional stability. Similar to
CLTE, the HDT of all composites increased compared to the neat BioPBS
matrix, Figure 8. Again,
the greatest increase (∼12 °C, 11%) was observed in the
composites reinforced with 25% biocarbon content. Statistical analyses
of HDT measurements are available in the supporting information, Table S4. Improvement in HDT is often attributed
to the improved stiffness associated with the reinforced composites;60,61 it was expected that the addition of GnPs would further improve
both the HDT and CLTE of the biocomposites.58,62 However, this was not observed in this study. Perhaps higher levels
of dispersion and improved orientation of the GnPs within the matrix
would result in further thermo-dimensional stability.22,63

Conclusions
BioPBS was successfully combined with biocarbon
and graphene, creating
a hybrid bionanocomposite. These composites had improved thermo-mechanical
properties compared to neat BioPBS. Incorporating biocarbon into a
bioplastic composite increases the value of this co-product. Biocomposites
loaded with 25 wt % biocarbon showed 57, 13, and 32% improvements
in tensile modulus, HDT, and CLTE, respectively. Further improvements
were found when graphene was added to the biocomposite, forming a
hierarchical hybrid bionanocomposite. Two processing methods were
used to incorporate graphene in the composites: DC and MB processing
techniques. The two methods resulted in different internal morphologies,
which subsequently impacted the mechanical properties of the composites.
However, little change was observed in the thermo-dimensional properties
studied. Composites processed using the DC technique showed the greatest
increase in tensile strength and modulus: 17 and 120%, respectively.
Composites processed using the MB technique had slightly lower strength
and modulus but almost twice the impact strength compared with DC
blends. This MB technique was found to have a superior balance of
stiffness and toughness likely due to the presence of superclustered
graphene platelets. It is recommended that large-scale processing
techniques be used to create these composites to confirm their industrial
viability. It would also be interesting to add further toughing agents
like bio-based glycerol, or study the electrical conductivity of the
composites.

Experimental Section
Materials
Injection-grade BioPBS (PBS FZ71PM), a product
of PTT MCC Biochem CO., Ltd., Thailand, was obtained from Competitive
Green Technologies, Canada. The injection-grade BioPBS had a melt
flow index (MFI) of 22 g/10 min at 190 °C with 2.16 kg, a density
of 1.26 g/cm3, and a melting point of 115 °C. Miscanthus grass biocarbon was obtained from Genesis Industries,
and the Miscanthus biocarbon was produced through
a two-stage slow pyrolysis process at 500 °C and sifted to ∼6.35
mm. Once received, the biocarbon was ground in a planetary ball mill
(Retsch PM100, Germany) with 50, 10 mm diameter balls at 250 rpm for
1 h, resulting in particles with an average size of 16.25 ± 14.68
μm. GnPs (Grade C) with a particle diameter of less than
2 μm, thickness of 1–5 nm, and surface area of 500 m2/g were used as received, purchased from XG Sciences, Lansing,
MI, USA.

Processing of Hybrid Biocomposites
BioPBS and biocarbon
were dried for 8 h at 80 and 105 °C, respectively, prior to processing.
The remaining moisture content prior to processing of the BioPBS,
biocarbon, and graphene was less than 0.1, 1.0, and 2.0 wt %, respectively,
as determined using an infrared moisture analyzer (Sartorius MA37-1,
Germany). Compounding and injection molding took place in a 15-cc
co-rotating, twin-screw microcompounder paired with a 12-cc micro
injection molder (Xplore Instruments, The Netherlands). Compounding
was conducted at 140 °C with a screw speed of 100 rpm. Injection
molding was conducted using a mold temperature of 30 °C, an injection
pressure of 10 bar, and an injection time of 10 s. First, BioPBS pellets
and biocarbon powder were briefly mixed together (all blends were
formulated on wt % basis) by hand in BioPBS/BC wt % ratios of 90/10
through 75/25 and directly compounded for 2 min in the above conditions.
Second, two different processing techniques were utilized to compound
biocarbon and graphene into a BioPBS matrix to create hybrid bionanocomposites:
(I) direct compounding (DC), where BioPBS, BC, and GnP were mixed
by hand in ratios of 75/24/1 and 75/20/5 and compounded directly for
2 min in above conditions; (II) a masterbatch (MB) of BioPBS and graphene
was prepared by compounding in the same conditions for 2 min, to form
a BioPBS blend with 25 wt % GnP content. The masterbatch was then
diluted with BioPBS pellets and compounded with BC again for 2 min
to form the same BioPBS/BC/GnP blend ratios 75/24/1 and 75/20/5. In
both processing methods, samples were injection molded immediately
after the final compounding step and conditioned following ASTM D618
prior to further characterization.

Thermo-Mechanical Analysis
Tensile and flexural tests
were conducted using an Instron 3382 (Instron) following ASTM D638
and D790, respectively. Impact strength of the materials was measured
using a 5 ft·lb pendulum in a TMI Monitor Impact Tester (Testing
Machines Inc), following ASTM D256. Samples were notched immediately
after processing using a TMI Notching Cutter (Testing Machines Inc).
Five samples were used for each test.

The heat deflection temperature
(HDT) was determined under three-point bending following ASTM D648
using a DMA Q800 (TA Instruments). Samples were tested at a heating
rate of 2 °C/min until a deflection of 250 μm was reached.

The coefficient of linear thermal expansion (CLTE) was measured
using a TMA Q400 (TA Instruments), following ASTM E831. Tests were
conducted in a temperature range from −60 to 100 °C at
a heating rate of 5 °C/min; samples were cut to ∼6 mm
× 6 mm × 3 mm. The expansion probe was set normal to the
injection flow direction with an applied force of 0.05 N. Further
thermal properties (available in the supporting information, Table S1) were analyzed using a DSC Q200 (TA
Instruments) in a nitrogen atmosphere. First, the sample (5–10
mg) was heated to 180 °C at 10 °C/min and held for 2 min,
then cooled to −60 °C at 5 °C/min and held for 2
min. This cycle was repeated to erase the thermal history of the first
cycle; the second heating scan and the first cooling scan were used
for analysis. Percentage crystallinity of biocomposites was calculated
(Table S1) using the same method as that
of Chen et al.64 Two samples were used
for each test.

Rheology Analysis
Two methods were used to determine
the rheological properties of the composites. First, the MFI was measured
following ASTM D1238 procedure A at 190 °C under 2.16 kg. Second,
frequency-dependent viscosity was determined using an MCR302 rheometer
(Anton Paar GmbH, Austria); a frequency sweep was conducted from 500
to 0.1 rad/s at 150 °C. Zero shear viscosity was obtained using
a Carreau regression; two samples were used for each test.

Morphological Analysis
The impact fracture surfaces
of the composites were observed using scanning electron microscopy,
a Phenom ProX SEM (Phenom-World, The Netherlands) with a 15 kV acceleration
voltage. Prior to imaging, samples were gold sputter coated for 5
s using a 108 manual sputter coater (TED PELLA, Inc). Samples were
prepared for transmission electron microscopy using a Leica RM microtome
(Leica Biosystems, Germany) to cut ∼100 nm thick sections from
the fracture site. A 200 kV field emission TEM (Tecnai G2 F20, FEI)
was used for imaging.
