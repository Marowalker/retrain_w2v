The conductivity
and open-circuit voltage (OCV) of lithium-solvated
electron solutions (LiSESs) based on anthracene in tetrahydrofuran
were studied by both experimental measurements and density functional
theory calculations with a range-separated functional based on the
M06 form and the Solvation Model based on Density (SMD). The OCV was
found to decrease with increasing temperature and the ratio of lithium
to anthracene. The enthalpy change (ΔH) of
LiSESs was the internal energy change of the cell reaction. The conductivity
of LiSESs exhibited a weakly metallic-like behavior. The electron
transport was facilitated by molecular collisions promoted by the
formation of dimeric structures as intermediates. The conductivity
of LiSESs at 295.15 K presents positive correlation with the entropy
change (ΔS) associated with the variation in
the ratio of lithium to poly-aromatic hydrocarbon, including p-terphenyl, anthracene, and triphenylene.

1 Introduction
Since the first fabrication
of the lithium ion battery in the 1970s,
it has quickly become an important power source for portable devices.
Researchers have made a lot of efforts to improve the performance
of lithium-based batteries and one long-standing problem is the anode
material. Current research interests mainly focus on solid-state and
semisolid-state anode materials such as graphite, carbonaceous materials,1−3 and alkali metals such as lithium.4,5 However, the
semisolid lithium flow cells have very poor conductivity so that large
quantity of additives was required to improve the conductivity.6 Solid anode materials such as metallic lithium
have some associated safety problems as well as slow recharge rate.
A potential alternative anode material was the lithium-solvated electron
solution, a liquid-state anode material where metallic lithium is
dissolved in tetrahydrofuran (THF) solutions of poly-aromatic hydrocarbons
(PAHs). It has been experimentally verified that lithium dissolved
in THF solution of biphenyl and naphthalene could be used as the anode
material in a cell to replace solid-state graphite,7 with remarkable electrochemical properties of biphenyl-8 and naphthalene9-based
LiSESs. The main feature of LiSESs is that they show weak metallic-like
conductivity behavior—the conductivity of LiSESs decreases
with increasing temperature. In addition, studies on interactions
between lithium and biphenyl and naphthalene have shown remarkable
energy storage capacity, where the lithium atoms bind to PAH through
charge-transfer processes.10,11 In our recent work,12 we investigated the open-circuit voltage (OCV)
and conductivity of triphenylene-based LiSESs and reported the entropy
changes of LiSESs when varying lithium concentration. In this work,
the electrochemical properties of anthracene-based LiSESs are characterized
by OCV and conductivity measurements, in comparison with enthalpy
change associated with binding lithium atoms to anthracene monomer,
and the entropy change (ΔS) associated with
the variation in the ratio of lithium to PAH.

2 Results
and Discussions
2.1 OCV, Entropy, and Enthalpy
of the LiSESs
In the half-cell experiment measurement of
OCV of anthracene-based
LiSESs, metallic lithium is used as the reference electrode. On the
lithium electrode side, lithium is oxidized into Li+, whereas
on the LiSES electrode side, anthracene molecules receive electrons,
binding to Li+ which is transported through Li+-conducting membrane.

This process is modeled by the lithium
anthracene complex illustrated in Figure 1a. The 2s electron of lithium atom is transferred
to anthracene molecule. Various complex structures are obtained by
locating lithium atom at different positions. The average binding
energy per lithium atom of the system is determined by 1  

Figure 1 (a) Optimized geometrical structures of the
lithium and anthracene
complexes with labeled charge values. (b) Temperature dependence of
OCV of 0.1 M anthracene-based LiSESs with different ratios of lithium
to anthracene. (c) Enthalpy change (ΔH) by
experimental measurement and theoretical computation with different
ratios of lithium to anthracene.

With one lithium atom binding to an anthracene molecule,
the structure
with lithium atom above the center ring (9, 10-position) of anthracene
is more stable, which is consistent with the reported higher reactivity
of the center ring of anthracene molecule.13 The center ring has the highest aromaticity because of the superposition
of the resonance effect of its own and the double induction effect
from adjacent resonating ring (one at a Kekulé structure as
shown in Figure 1a).
This provides one geometric account for the highest nucleus-independent
chemical shifts of central ring.14 When
the second lithium atom is added, the anthracene molecule would bend
because of stronger interaction with lithium atoms. When lithium atoms
are positioned at the edges of the anthracene molecule, the binding
strength is smaller than the case where one lithium is at the middle
and the other is at the edge of anthracene. It is also noticed that
the binding energy of the structures with lithium atom positioned
on the different sides of the anthracene molecule are higher than
that of other configurations. The most energetically stable structure
is found to be the structure with one lithium atom above the central
ring and the other below the side ring. The binding energy per lithium
atom in gas phase is 0.2 eV higher than the value reported by Ishikawa
et al.15 Ishikawa used Lee–Yang–Parr
correlation functional (B3LYP), whereas M06 functional developed by
Zhao & Truhlar16 is used in this work.
The average binding energy increases when the second lithium atom
is incorporated. This is consistent with the larger enthalpy change
determined from experiment when the ratio of lithium to anthracene
increases from 1 to 2.

The OCV of anthracene-based LiSESs was
measured with metallic lithium
as its reference electrode in half-cell experiment. OCV (Vocv) is determined in terms of the lithium chemical potential
difference between the half-cell (μhc) and the reference
electrode (μref) as 2  where z indicates the charge
transferred in the cell reaction and F is the Faraday’s
constant. For a LiSES half-cell with lithium metal as the reference
electrode, z was set to be 1 because lithium loses
one electron during cell reaction. The lithium chemical potential
difference is the free-energy change of electrode materials with different
lithium content with the respect to metallic lithium.17,18 Thus, the OCV could be written as a function of free-energy change
of the cell reaction through the Nernst equation 3  

ΔH is the enthalpy change and ΔS is the entropy
change of the cell reaction. The entropy
change can be computed from the temperature dependence of the OCV
as presented in Figure 1b. At a temperature of 25 °C, the OCV of the LiSES is measured
to be 937.0 mV for the ratio of Li to anthracene ratio as 1:2, 903.9
mV for 1:1, and 897.7 mV for 2:1. Within the temperature range of
11–26 °C, the LiSES with a Li to anthracene ratio of 1:2
has the highest OCV. The OCV decreases with increasing temperature
for all LiSESs with different ratios of lithium to anthracene, which
can be used to compute the entropy change as shown in eq 3. The formation of lithium–anthracene
complex via binding lithium atoms to anthracene molecules reduces
the degree of freedom and resulting in a negative entropy change.
In this temperature range, the OCV of the LiSES decreases with increasing
lithium concentration can be understood from two aspects: the ideal
limit of lithium concentration is 100%, which means no free energy
difference due to the reference electrode is pure lithium; the other
aspect is considering that the increasing lithium concentration will
lead to larger entropy reduction as shown in Figure 1b. The entropy change in anthracene-based
LiSESs is 1 order of magnitude higher than that of solid-state lithium-intercalated
structures, for example, LixC619 and LixCoO2,20 which is also the highest
among various species of PAH including biphenyl,8 naphthalene,9 triphenylene,12 and 1,3,5-triphenylbenzenes.21

Using eq 3, the enthalpy
changes of the LiSES during cell reactions are determined to be −1.35,
−1.33, and −1.43 eV for the ratio of Li to anthracene
as 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0, respectively. The enthalpy change of the cell
reaction refers to the internal energy change which can also be obtained
through theoretical computation. We employ the M06 functional16 with 6-31g(d,p) basis set and SMD model22 to compute the enthalpy change in anthracene-based
LiSESs. The computed enthalpy change is in good agreement with the
experimental results as shown in Figure 1c. For all LiSESs, the absolute values of
our computed enthalpy change are larger than experimental data. The
discrepancy could come from two sources. First, the complex structures
are not identical to the real ones in LiSESs. Second, the electrolyte
might interact with the reference electrode, that is, metallic lithium,
in the experiment. It has been reported that LiPF6 in 1:1
ethylene carbonate (EC)/ethyl methyl carbonate (EMC) solvent would
be slowly decomposed into LiF and PF5, which could form
adduct with the solvent molecules and triggers a series of subsequent
reactions.23−25 This would alter the chemical potential of the reference
electrode, thus affects the measured data of enthalpy change.

2.2 Conductivity of the LiSES
The carrier
transport in the LiSES is enabled by the collision processes among
anthracenes and lithium-bounded anthracenes in the solution. During
the collision, various dimeric structures could be formed as shown
in Figure 2a. For instance,
one anthracene can collide with the complex of lithium and anthracene,
resulting in one dimeric structure where the lithium atom is sandwiched
in between two anthracenes with a separation of 3.6 Å. The binding
energy turns out to be the highest value when the ratio of lithium
to anthracene is 1:1. Compared with the complex with monomeric anthracene,
the complex with dimeric anthracenes exhibits much higher binding
energy. Similarly, the electron transport during molecular collisions
is an important conducting process in the solution, and the process
is possibly performed through the formation of dimeric structures.
To investigate the mechanism of electron transport among anthracenes
in LiSESs, the conductivity of 0.1 M anthracene-based LiSESs with
different ratios of lithium to anthracene is measured under different
temperatures as presented in Figure 2b.

Figure 2 (a) Optimized structures with 1, 2, and 4 lithium atoms
binding
to dimeric anthracene molecules with labeled charge values. (b) Temperature-dependent
conductivity of anthracene-based LiSESs with various ratios of lithium
to anthracene. (c) Conductivity of anthracene-based LiSES at 22 °C
vs binding energy of dimers with different ratios of lithium to anthracene.

When the ratio of lithium to anthracene
is 1:2, the excess of anthracene
could form dimers. The heterogeneity of the solution is very high.
Correspondingly, the orientation of dimers is not well ordered, leading
to poor conductivity. When raising the temperature, more disorder
is anticipated, and therefore, conductivity decreases further. Interestingly,
when the ratio of lithium to anthracene is 1:1, the complex with dimeric
anthracenes reaches to the maximal value, which could promote better
alignment of these dimers. Therefore, the conductivity is the highest.
Under this circumstance, the disorder caused by increasing temperature
is stronger than other cases. When the ratio of lithium to anthracene
increases to 2:1, the excess lithium will generate clusters among
complexes. Again, the system is not well ordered in terms of orientation
of dimers. Thus, the conductivity becomes poor again. The LiSESs have
a similar conductivity for the ratio of lithium to anthracene as 0.5:1
and 2:1. The conductivity of all LiSESs decreases when temperature
increases, similar to metallic systems. This temperature-dependent
conductivity is also observed in other LiSESs based on triphenylene,12p-terphenyl,26 and ammonia.27 The conductivity
is first enhanced and then suppressed when more lithium is added into
the solutions as shown in Figure 2c. This scenario is supported by the nice correlation
between conductivity and binding energy of the dimeric structures
as presented in Figure 2c. A similar correlation was also found in LiSESs based on triphenylene.12

The conductivity of LiSES at 295.15 K
presents positive correlation
with the entropy change (ΔS) associated with
the variation in the ratio of lithium to PAH, including p-terphenyl, anthracene, and triphenylene as shown in Figure 3. The conductivity of p-terphenyl-based LiSES26 increases
linearly with the entropy change caused by varying lithium content,
so do triphenylene12 and anthracene. When
more lithium atoms are incorporated in the LiSES, the entropy change
in the cell reaction becomes more negative. This is due to the fact
that the formation of more tightly bound complex of lithium and anthracene
reduces more degrees of freedom of the system. Importantly, tightly
bound complex disturbs the alignment of PAH, leading to more disorder
in the geometric orientation. The implication is that the entropy
change of cell reaction and entropy change of dimeric structure spatial
distribution are negatively correlated in LiSESs. Thus, the conductivity
of LiSESs will decrease as the entropy change of cell reaction becomes
more negative, when increasing the ratio of lithium to PAH.

at 295.15 K and entropy change (ΔS) of cell
reaction of 0.1 M anthracene-, triphenylene-,12 and p-terphenyl26-based
LiSES. The ratio in the parenthesis refers
to the ratio of Li to PAHs.

3 Conclusions
The interaction between
lithium and anthracene molecules, quantified
by the enthalpy change, determines the OCV of LiSESs. The conductivity
exhibits metallic-like behavior, where the conductivity of the solutions
decreases with raising the temperature. The clear correlation between
the change of conductivity and the binding affinity of dimeric lithium
and anthracene complex for different ratio of lithium to anthracene
suggests that charge carriers transport in LiSESs through molecular
collision facilitated by dimer formation process. Interestingly, a
general positive correlation between the conductivity and entropy
change is observed in three types of PAH-based LiSESs, which could
hold for other PAH-based LiSES as well.

4 Computational
and Experimental Methods
4.1 Computational Method
Density functional
theory based calculations with the range-separated functional based
on the M06 form,16 which includes the van
der Waals force, have been performed with the 6-31g(d,p) basis set
to optimize the geometries and calculate the binding energies of various
structures between lithium atoms and anthracene molecules. The solvent
effect was modeled with SMD model.22

4.2 Preparation of LiSES Based on Anthracene
Reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used as received.
LiSES samples were prepared inside an argon-filled glove box using
anhydrous THF as the solvent. The 0.1 M solutions were made by dissolving
anthracene in THF with molar ratio 1:123 (the volume expansion due
to anthracene dissolution was neglected). Various amounts of lithium
metal were then added to the solution to form anthracene-based LiSESs
with a Li–anthracene ratio of 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0.

4.3 Conductivity Measurements
Conductivity
measurements of the anthracene-based LiSESs were carried out at various
temperatures ranging from 1 to 23 °C using a modified procedure
previously described for naphthalene-based LiSESs.9 TetraCon 325 Standard conductivity cell probe that utilizes
the four-electrode measuring principle with the measurement range
of 1 μS/m to 2 S/cm
was used for conductivity measurements. The probe was attached to
a Cond 3310 meter and calibrated using a 0.01 M KCl solution. A sealed
tube containing LiSES with the probe dipped into the solution was
assembled in a glove box. The conductivity measurements were performed
out of the glove box and ice–water bath was used to cool down
the sealed tube. The ice bath was removed when the temperature of
the tube was sufficiently low and the tube was exposed to ambient
temperature. The conductivity of the solution was measured and recorded
upon heating up the tube.

4.4 OCV Measurements
Metallic lithium
was immersed in 1 M LiPF6 in the EC/EMC electrolyte solution
and served as the reference electrode during the OCV measurement for
LiSESs. A Li+-conducting ceramic membrane was used as a
separator between the lithium metal electrode and LiSES electrode.9 The OCV was measured at the temperature range
of 11–26 °C. From the temperature dependence of OCV, the
entropy and enthalpy changes to be determined for the half-cell could
be determined.28
