Postfunctionalization
of azaBODIPY (the BF2 complex
of azadipyrromethene) is highly desirable due to the strong tunable
absorption bands at wavelengths above 650 nm and the wide-ranging
applications of this class of dyes in biomedicine and materials science.
Currently available postfunctionalization methods for this class of
dyes have been limited to the Pd-catalyzed coupling reactions on β-halogenated
(brominated or iodinated) azaBODIPY platforms. In this work, we report
a new strategy for the facile postfunctionalization of the azaBODIPY
chromophore with various vinyl ketone and vinyl esters based on a
Wittig reaction on our previously developed β-formylazaBODIPYs
and our recently developed β-bromo-β′-formylazaBODIPYs.
Our strategy uses easily accessible starting materials and mild reaction
conditions. It is highly compatible with various common phosphonium
ylides (aliphatic, aromatic, and ester substituted ones). These resultant
bromo-containing β-vinyl ketone/ester functionalized azaBODIPYs
are potential photosensitizers and can be further functionalized via
coupling reactions. The ester groups on some of these resultant azaBODIPYs
can be further hydrolyzed to achieve the desired water solubility
and conjugate with the biomolecule and solid surface.

Introduction
AzaBODIPY (the BF2 complex of azadipyrromethene, Chart 1) shows a strong absorption
band at wavelengths above 650 nm, large molar extinction coefficients,
and high photostability. This class of dyes has attracted wide-ranging
research interest in biomedicine and materials science, for example,
as photosensitizers (for photodynamic therapy), sensors, and near-infrared
labeling agents.1−5 BODIPY, as the meso-carbon analogue of azaBODIPY
(Chart 1), has been
extensively studied.6,7 There are many well-established
methods available for the facile postfunctionalization of BODIPY.
By contrast, few research efforts have been devoted to the postfunctionalization
of azaBODIPY. Recently, some postfunctionalization methods have developed
based on Pd-catalyzed coupling (Suzuki,8 Stille,9 and Sonogashira,10Figure 1) reactions8−11 on β-halogenated (brominated or iodinated) azaBODIPYs. These
postfunctionalization methods although elegant generally require the
use of a transition metal catalyst. In addition, the yields are far
from optimal (<50%). In some coupling reactions, a tedious purification
process is required due to the partial removal of the BF2 unit under those reaction conditions.

strategy based on the Wittig reaction on the β-formylazaBODIPY
platform presented in this work.

Chart 1 Core Structures of BODIPY and azaBODIPY
As part of our continuous research efforts in the preparation
of
functionalized azaBODIPYs, we have recently reported several strategies
(thiophene-fusion,12a “push-pull”12b and “conformation-restriction”12c) for the fine tuning of the optical properties
of azaBODIPYs. We have previously reported the regioselective β-formylation
of BODIPYs and have successfully extended this reaction to the azaBODIPY
system.13 Those resultant β-formylBODIPYs
have received wide-ranging research interest in a highly diverse research
fields.14,15 We rationalized that these resultant β-formylazaBODIPYs
may be applied for the Wittig reaction14d,16 to achieve
the facile postfunctionalization of the azaBODIPY chromophore (Figure 1). With our recent
progress in the regioselective β-bromination of β-formylazaBODIPYs,
we anticipated that the resultant β-bromo-β′-formylazaBODIPY
may be used as a privileged platform in the facile postfunctionalization
of the azaBODIPY system. Herein, we report the facile preparation
of a series of β-vinyl ketone/ester functionalized azaBODIPYs
via a straightforward Wittig reaction on β-formylazaBODIPYs,
as well as the X-ray structures, the photophysical properties, and
the electrochemical properties of these resultant dyes.

Results and Discussion
Syntheses
β-FormylazaBODIPYs 2a–c were
prepared in good (75–86%) yields from readily
available azaBODIPYs 1a–c using our
previously established formylation procedure (Scheme 1)13a and were
characterized by NMR and HRMS analysis. Their further regioselective
bromination smoothly proceeded with liquid bromine17 and generated the corresponding β-bromo-β′-formylazaBODIPYs 3a–c in excellent (91–95%) isolated
yields.

Scheme 1 Synthesis of β-FormylazaBODIPYs 2a–c and β-Bromo-β′-formylazaBODIPYs 3a–c
These resultant β-formylazaBODIPYs 2a–c and 3a–c smoothly
reacted
with various readily available phosphonium ylides 5a–c14d,16 under Wittig reaction conditions
(80 °C in toluene), from which the desired β-vinyl ketone/ester
functionalized azaBODIPYs 4a–h were
isolated as the major products in 43–83% yields (Scheme 2). These resultant azaBODIPYs 4a–h were characterized via NMR and HRMS
analysis. The structures of azaBODIPYs 4a and 4b and their key synthetic precursors 2a and 2b were further confirmed by X-ray analysis (Figure 2). This Wittig reaction uses readily available
starting materials (β-formylazaBODIPYs and phosphonium ylide
reagents) and mild reaction conditions and shows good compatibility
with various functionalities. It was found that the electron-donating
substituents in azaBODIPYs 1 increase the reactivity
of this formylation and the subsequent Wittig reaction and the yields
of these two reactions. The ester moiety may be further hydrolyzed
to generate a carboxylic acid group, which provides the desired water
solubility and a valuable site for conjugation with the biomolecule
and solid surface.

Scheme 2 Synthesis of β-Vinyl Ketone/Ester
Functionalized azaBODIPYs 4a–h and
the Further Functionalization
of 4d via Suzuki Coupling Reaction
The remaining bromo substituent in azaBODIPYs 4d, 4e, and 4f provides the desired
heavy-atom effect
to facilitate their applications as photosensitizers. In addition,
this bromo substituent also provides a valuable site for various coupling
reactions including the Suzuki coupling reaction demonstrated in this
work (Scheme 2). The
Suzuki coupling of azaBODIPY 4d with 4-(diphenylamino)phenylboronic
acid smoothly proceeded to generate azaBODIPY 4k in 47%
isolated yield. The installation of triphenylamine, an important unit
in many electronic devices, results in an interesting donor–azaBODIPY–acceptor
(D−π–A) structure.

X-ray Structures
Crystals suitable for X-ray analysis
of azaBODIPYs 2a, 2b, 4a, and 4b (Figure 2) were obtained via the slow diffusion of petroleum ether into their
dichloromethane solutions under ambient conditions. As expected, these
azaBODIPY dyes all show an almost planar structure for the azaBODIPY
core (defined by the central six-membered C2N3B ring and two adjacent five-membered pyrrole rings) and a perpendicular
arrangement of the plane defined by F–B–F atoms to that
of the azaBODIPY core. The B–N distances for these azaBODIPYs
are within 1.55–1.58 Å, which indicates the usual delocalization
of the positive charge. These azaBODIPYs show a characteristic core
structure similar to most of the previously reported azaBODIPY systems.1c,12c The dihedral angles of the four phenyl rings in the dipyrrin core
are in the range of 7.7–81.2° (Table S2), indicating the intramolecular hydrogen bondings between
F and the hydrogen atoms on four phenyl moieties. The dihedral angles
defined by the two pyrrole units in azaBODIPYs 2a and 2b are 12.4 and 14.8°, respectively, which were reduced
to 3.8 and 1.1°, respectively, for azaBODIPYs 4a and 4b. This indicates that the presence of the β-vinyl
ester moiety reduces the distortion of the planar structure of the
azaBODIPY chromophore. The average root-mean-square deviation of the
19 atoms (atoms 1–19 labeled in Figures S5 and S7) from the mean plane of the azaBODIPY 4a and 4b cores are 0.0037 and 0.0019 Å, respectively.
This indicates that the β-vinyl ester moiety and the C8BN3 central core nearly stay at the same planar structure.
Thus, the installation of this β-vinyl ester moiety indeed extends
the π-conjugation of the chromophore.

Photophysical Properties
The photophysical properties
of these resultant azaBODIPYs 4a–k and their key synthetic precursors 2a–c and 3a–c were investigated
in chloroform as summarized in Table 1. Each of these dyes, except for 4k, shows
an intense absorption band in the range of 650–690 nm with
a molar extinction coefficient (57 400–82 600
cm–1 M–1) comparable to that of
most azaBODIPYs appearing in the literature.1c In comparison with azaBODIPYs 2 and 3,
each of the azaBODIPYs 4 shows an around 3–30
nm redshift of the absorption spectra. AzaBODIPY 4k shows
two absorption bands (a strong absorption band centered at 688 nm
and a broad shoulder tailing up to 850 nm). The relatively low molar
extinction coefficient (31 600 cm–1 M–1) observed for azaBODIPY 4k with respect
to azaBODIPYs 4a–j may be partially
attributed to the extremely broad absorption bands of this dye (Figure 3a).

b Fluorescence
quantum yields were
calculated using 1b (ϕ = 0.36 in chloroform) as
the reference. The standard errors are less than 10% from three independent
measurements.

Each of the
azaBODIPYs 4 shows a weak fluorescence
emission in the range 690–730 nm (Table 1). The relatively lower fluorescence emission
for those bromo-containing azaBODIPYs may be attributed to the heavy
atom effect of the bromo substituent on these azaBODIPYs, which makes
these azaBODIPYs potential photosensitizers for dye-sensitized solar
cells.18 The weak fluorescence of azaBODIPY 4k may be attributed to the nonradiative decay associated
with free rotation of the triphenylamine moiety and the internal charge
transfer effect from the triphenylamine moiety to the azaBODIPY core.

The solvatochromic effects of three common organic solvents (toluene,
chloroform, and methanol) on the absorption and emission properties
of azaBODIPYs 4a–k were investigated
(Figures S11–S27) as summarized
in Table S2. A slight blueshift of the
absorption and emission band and a slight decrease in the fluorescence
quantum yield were observed with increasing solvent polarity. For
example, a slight blueshift of the absorption (from 685 to 672 nm)
and emission band (from 719 to 715 nm) and a slight decrease in the
fluorescence quantum yield (from 0.10 to 0.04) were observed for azaBODIPY 4a by changing the solvent from toluene to methanol. Similar
solvatochromic behavior has been reported previously for the solution
of azaBODIPY 1b.1c

Electrochemical
Properties
The cyclic voltammetry of 1a, 2a, 3a, 4d, and 4k were
performed in deoxygenated dichloromethane at room
temperature with tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (TBAPF6) as the supporting electrolyte (Figure 4). Most of these dyes show two reversible
reduction waves and one reversible oxidation wave. AzaBODIPYs 2a and 4d have reduction potentials more negative
than 1a. This indicates that the installation of electron-withdrawing
substituents (formyl and vinyl ester groups) at the β-position
of the chromophore increases the electron-deficiency of the chromophore,
and makes azaBODIPYs 2a and 4d more susceptible
to reduction than 1a. A similar effect was observed for
the installation of bromo substituent (3a). AzaBODIPY 4k, containing a strong electron-donating triphenylamine substituent,
shows one irreversible reduction at −1.10 V. The highest occupied
molecular orbital and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital energy levels
for 4d and 4k were estimated based on their
onset potential of the first oxidation and reduction waves (−5.59
and −4.08 eV for 4d, −4.95 and −3.51
eV for 4k, respectively). The calculated electrochemical
energy band gap for 4k is 1.45 eV, which is in good agreement
with its optical band gap.

Conclusions
In
conclusion, we have developed a new strategy for the facile
postfunctionalization of azaBODIPY based on a classic Wittig reaction
on our previously reported β-formylazaBODIPYs and our recently
developed β-bromo-β′-formylazaBODIPYs. Our strategy
uses readily available starting materials, requires mild reaction
conditions, and features good yields and good compatibility with various
functionalities. The installation of β-vinyl ketone/ester increases
the π-conjugation of the system, whereas it has negligible influence
on the planar structure of the chromophore. These resultant β-vinyl
ketone/ester functionalized azaBODIPY dyes show intense absorption
in the NIR range (660–690 nm). The resultant bromo-containing
β-vinyl ketone/ester functionalized azaBODIPYs are potential
photosensitizers and can be further applied for coupling reactions
to generate various β,β′-difunctionalized D−π–A
dyes.

Experimental Section
General
Reagents and solvents were
used as received
from commercial suppliers unless noted otherwise. All reactions were
performed in oven-dried or flame-dried glassware unless otherwise
stated and were monitored by thin-layer chromatography (TLC) using
0.25 mm silica gel plates with a UV indicator (60F-254). 1H and 13C NMR were recorded on a 300 or 500 MHz NMR spectrometer
at room temperature. Chemical shifts (δ) are given in ppm relative
to CDCl3 (7.26 ppm for 1H and 77 ppm for 13C) or to internal TMS. High-resolution mass spectra (HRMS)
were obtained using APCI-TOF or MALDI-TOF in positive mode.

Photophysical
Measurements
UV–visible absorption
and fluorescence emission spectra were recorded on commercial spectrophotometers
(190–900 nm scan range) at room temperature (10 mm quartz cuvette).
Relative fluorescence quantum efficiencies of BODIPY derivatives were
obtained by comparing the areas under the corrected emission spectrum
of the test sample in various organic solvents with that of Rhodamine
B (Φ = 0.36 in chloroform).10b Nondegassed,
spectroscopic grade solvents and a 10 mm quartz cuvette were used.
Dilute solutions (0.01 < A < 0.05) were used
to minimize the reabsorption effects. Quantum yields were determined
using eq 1(19) 1  where subscripts x and r refer, respectively,
to our sample x and reference (standard) fluorophore r with known
quantum yield Ar in a specific solvent; F stands for the spectrally corrected, integrated fluorescence
spectra; A(λex) denotes the absorbance
at the used excitation wavelength λex; and n represents the refractive index of the solvent (in principle
at the average emission wavelength).

Cyclic Voltammograms
Cyclic voltammograms of 1 mM 1a, 2a, 3a, 4d, and 4k were measured in
dichloromethane solution, containing 0.1
M TBAPF6 as the supporting electrolyte, a glassy carbon
electrode as a working electrode, Pt wire as a counter electrode,
and a saturated calomel electrode as a reference electrode at 50 mV
s–1 scanning rate at room temperature (Figure 4).

containing 0.1 M TBAPF6 as the supporting electrolyte at
room temperature. A glassy
carbon electrode is used as the working electrode and the scan rate
is 50 mV s–1.

Crystallography
Crystals of 2a, 2b, 4a, and 4b suitable for X-ray
analysis were obtained via the slow diffusion of petroleum ether into
their dichloromethane solutions under ambient conditions. The vial
containing this solution was placed, loosely capped, to promote the
crystallization. A suitable crystal was chosen and mounted on a glass
fiber using grease. Data were collected using a diffractometer equipped
with a graphite crystal monochromator situated in the incident beam
for data collection at room temperature. Cell parameters were retrieved
using SMART20 software and refined using
SAINT21 on all observed reflections. The
determination of unit cell parameters and data collection were performed
with Mo Kα radiation (λ) at 0.71073 Å. Data reduction
was performed using the SAINT software, which corrects for Lp and
decay. The structure was solved by the direct method using the SHELXS-974
program and refined by the least squares method on F2,
SHELXL-97,22 incorporated in SHELXTL V5.10.23 CCDC-1547895 (2a), CCDC-1547896
(2b), CCDC-1519967 (4a), CCDC-1519968 (4b) contain the supporting crystallographic data for this
article. These data can be obtained free of charge from the Cambridge
Crystallographic Data Centre via www.ccdc.cam.ac.uk/data_request/cif.

Synthesis
AzaBODIPYs 1a–c1c,12b and phosphonium ylides 5a–c16 were synthesized according
to the literature.

General Procedure for the Preparation of
β-FormylazaBODIPYs 2a–c
To the anhydrous dimethylformamide
(3 mL) was slowly added POCl3 (3 mL) at 0 °C under
argon. It was left stirring for 30 min at 0 °C before addition
of azaBODIPYs 1a–c (0.3 mmol) in
1,2-dichloroethane (10 mL). The resulting mixture was stirred at 70
°C for 2 h. The reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature
and quenched via the slow addition of 10% aqueous solution of K2CO3 (200 mL). The reaction mixture was further
stirred for 50 min and extracted with dichloromethane (30 mL ×
3). The organic layers were combined, washed with water, and dried
over anhydrous MgSO4. The solvent was removed under vacuum.
The crude product was further purified with column chromatography
using the mixture of petroleum ether and dichloromethane (v/v = 1/2)
as eluent to afford the desired β-formylazaBODIPYs 2a–c as a dark cyan solid in 75–86% isolated

General Procedure

To β-formylazaBODIPYs 2a–c (0.6 mmol) in 50 mL dichloromethane was added liquid bromine
(0.7 mmol). The mixture was stirred at room temperature for 5 min
and quenched via the addition of an aqueous solution of sodium bicarbonate
(30 mL, 1 M). The reaction mixture was washed with brine and extracted
with dichloromethane (50 mL × 3). The organic layers were combined,
dried over anhydrous Na2SO4, and the organic
solvent was removed under vacuum. The residue was purified by column

General Procedure for the Preparation of azaBODIPYs 4a–j from Wittig Reaction
To freshly distilled
toluene (3 mL) in a dry Schlenk tube was added β-formylazaBODIPYs 2a–c and 3a–c (0.14 mmol) and phosphorus ylides 5a–c (1 mmol). The mixture was degassed via three freeze–pump–thaw
cycles at −78 °C before purging with argon again. The
mixture was then heated to 80 °C. TLC was used to follow the
reaction. Upon completion of the reaction, the mixture was cooled
to room temperature and washed with brine. The organic layers were
combined, dried over anhydrous Na2SO4, and the
solvent was removed under vacuum. The residue was purified by column
chromatography on silica using the mixture of petroleum ether and
dichloromethane (v/v = 1/2) as eluent to afford the desired azaBODIPYs 4a–j as a dark cyan solid in 43–79%
isolated yields.
