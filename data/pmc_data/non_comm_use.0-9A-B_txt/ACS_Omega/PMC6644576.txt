Solvation dynamics and rotational
relaxation of coumarin
480 in aqueous micelles of cationic gemini surfactants with diethyl
ether (EE) spacer group (m–EE–m) and tails with varying tail lengths (m = 12, 14, and 16) have been studied. Studies have been carried out
by measuring UV–visible absorption, steady-state fluorescence
and fluorescence anisotropy, time-resolved fluorescence and fluorescence
anisotropy, 1H NMR spectroscopy, and dynamic light scattering.
Effects of hydrocarbon tail length and hydrophilicity of spacer group
on solvation dynamics and rotational relaxation processes at inner
side of the Stern layer of micelles have been studied. With increasing
hydrophobicity of tails of surfactants, water molecules in the Stern
layer become progressively more rigid, resulting in a decrease in
the rate of solvation process with slow solvation as a major component.
With increasing hydrophilicity of the spacer group of gemini surfactant,
the extent of free water molecules is decreased, thereby making the
duration of the solvation process longer. Solvation times in the micelles
of gemini surfactants with hydrophilic spacer are almost 4 times longer
compared to those in the micelles of their conventional counterpart.
Rotational relaxation time increases with increasing tail length of
surfactant as a result of increasing microviscosity of micelles with
fast relaxation as a major component. With increasing hydrophilicity
of the spacer group, the anisotropy decay becomes slower due to the
formation of more compact micelles. Rotational relaxation in gemini
micelles is also slower compared to that in their conventional counterpart.
The anisotropy decay is found to be biexponential with lateral diffusion
of the probe along the surface of the micelle as a slow component.
Rotational motion of micelle as a whole is a very slow process, and
the motion becomes further slower with increasing size of the micelle.
The time constants for wobbling motion and lateral diffusion of the
probe become longer with increasing microviscosity of micelles.

1 Introduction
The dynamics of water molecules in the bulk is much different from
that in biological systems.1−8 The study of dynamics in biological systems is important because
it controls various processes in those systems.9 Because of this importance, a substantial amount of work
on the dynamics of water has been carried out in various confined
media, such as micelles,3,10−12 reverse micelles,13−15 mixed micelles,16−19 and cyclodextrin,4,20 those mimic the biological systems. Water molecules in these confined
media behave as “free” and “bound” water
molecules those are in dynamic exchange with each other.21,22 In most of the cases, the solvation dynamics has been studied by
the time-dependent fluorescence Stokes shift method.1−3,9,10,15,23,24 Vajda et al.4 noticed
a very fast (315 fs) solvation process in the bulk water phase using
coumarin 480 (C-480) as a probe with a single solvation time. However,
the solvation dynamics is slowed by manifolds in restricted environment
as compared to that in the bulk phase.3,4 Bhattacharyya
et al.3,25 first investigated the solvation dynamics
of C-480 and 4-aminopthalimide (4-AP) in the micelles of various types
of conventional surfactants, such as cetyltrimethylammonium bromide
(CTAB), sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), and Triton X-100 (TX-100), and
concluded that with different probe molecules solvation time remained
the same in similar environment. Hazra et al.26 reported the solvation dynamics and rotational relaxation of coumarin
153 (C-153) in SDS-dispersed single-walled carbon nanotubes. They
found that the rates of both solvation and rotational relaxation processes
become lower in this system as compared to those in bulk water. Shirota
et al.27 studied the solvation dynamics
of C-480 in the aqueous micelles of cationic and anionic surfactants
and observed that the solvation dynamics is faster in the micelles
of cationic surfactant as compared to that in the micelles of anionic
surfactant due to weaker hydrogen bonding between headgroup of the
former surfactant and water molecules. The effect of room-temperature
ionic liquid (RTIL) on the solvation dynamics as well as on the rotational
relaxation
of C-153 in the aqueous micelles of Triton X-100 was studied by Sarkar
and co-workers.28 They found that the presence
of ionic liquid increases the microfluidity of micelles that causes
faster solvation and rotational relaxation processes.

Sarkar
et al.18 noticed that both rotational
relaxation and solvation times increase with increasing hydrocarbon
tail length of conventional surfactants. This happened because of
increasing microviscosity of micelles with increasing tail length
of surfactants as a result of formation of more closely packed micelles.
Earlier, the direct correlation between rotational relaxation time
and microviscosity of micelles was observed by Maroncelli and co-workers.29 Studies have also been carried out by Sarkar
et al.30 to see the effect of tail length
of ionic liquids on the rotational motions of C-153 and rhodamine
6G in micelles. It has been observed that the rotational relaxation
process becomes slower in the micelles of C16mimCl as compared
to C12mimCl ionic liquid as the rotational motions are
more restricted in the former system due to the longer alkyl chain
length. Also, in another study, they found decrease in the rates of
solvation and rotational relaxation processes in the neat micelles
and microemulsions of each of ionic liquids [C2mim][C4SO4], [C2mim][C6SO4], and [C2mim][C8SO4].31 Samanta and co-workers32 reported the effect of alkyl tail length on the rotational dynamics
of polar and nonpolar solutes in a series of N-alkyl-N-methylmorpholinium ionic liquids. Studies have revealed
the location of these probes in distinct environment of the ionic
liquids from their contrasting rotational dynamics.

In recent
times, gemini
surfactants have attracted attention because of their countless applications
in nanotechnology, biotechnology, material science, supramolecular
chemistry, and pharmaceutics, such as drug delivery, gene delivery,
and so forth.33−37 Gemini surfactants are more surface-active than their conventional
counterparts.38 Aggregation properties
of a gemini surfactant are dependent on the various parts of the surfactant,
such as headgroup,39−41 spacer group,42−47 counterion,48 and alkyl chain length.49,50 Gemini surfactants are reported to have different types of spacer
groups like hydrophilic, hydrophobic, rigid, and flexible.38,51,52 Saha et al. studied the effect
of hydroxyl-group-substituted10 and polymethylene12 spacer groups on the solvation dynamics and
rotational relaxation processes in aqueous micelles. They demonstrated
that hydrogen bonding through hydroxyl groups on the spacer group
has a significant effect on retardation of solvation process in aqueous
micelles. Also, average solvation time increases with increasing polymethylene
spacer chain length as a result of increasing degree of counterion
dissociation.

Looking into the fact of interesting aggregation
behavior of gemini
surfactants and the effects of chemical nature of its spacer groups
as well as the effect of hydrocarbon tail length of conventional surfactants
on solvation dynamics and rotational dynamics, the present study aims
to see how these dynamics depend on the hydrophobicity of the tails
of gemini surfactants using C-480 as a probe (Scheme 1). In the present study, we have selected
a series of diethyl ether (EE) spacer group containing gemini surfactants
with varying hydrocarbon tail lengths, C12 (Gemini-X),
C14 (Gemini-Y), and C16 (Gemini-Z) (Scheme 1). We have also compared
our present dynamics data with those in the micelles of gemini surfactant
containing C12 tails and tetramethylene spacer group (Gemini-A)
(Scheme 1) studied
earlier.10 With these compounds, we could
simultaneously demonstrate how the
rates of solvation and rotational relaxation processes in aqueous
micelles vary with increasing tail length of gemini surfactants, that
is, increasing hydrophobicity of tails, and also how these rates change
with increasing hydrophilicity of spacer group with similar tails.
We have also shown how these rates in gemini micelles with hydrophobic
spacer group as well as with hydrophilic spacer group differ from
those in the micelles of their conventional counterparts, dodecyltrimethylammonium
bromide (DTAB), tetradecyltrimethylammonium bromide (TTAB), and cetyltrimethylammonium
bromide (CTAB) reported earlier.18

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 UV–Visible Absorption
and Steady-State
Fluorescence Study
The UV–visible absorption and steady-state
fluorescence spectra of C-480 have been recorded in the aqueous micelles
of Gemini-X, Gemini-Y, and Gemini-Z surfactants (Figure 1). To ensure complete solubilization
of C-480 molecules in the micelles, the concentration of each surfactant
was chosen to be 15 times of respective critical micelle concentration
(cmc). To see the effect of spacer group of gemini surfactants, we
have also compared our present results to those for Gemini-A studied
earlier.10 The peak maxima of absorption
and fluorescence bands of C-480 in all of these micellar systems are
tabulated in Table 1. The cmc values of all gemini surfactants determined in our previous
study using conductometric method are given in Table 1.53 To support
those values, the cmc values have also been determined by fluorescence
method in the present study (Figure 2). The solubilization of C-480 in the micelles is evidenced
by the change in fluorescence intensity with increasing concentration
of a surfactant (Figure 2). The cmc values determined by these two different methods corroborate
very well, which further supports the purity of the synthesized surfactants.
The peak positions of absorption and fluorescence bands of C-480 in
each of the micellar media of Gemini-X, -Y, and -Z are found to be
at 394 and 482 nm, respectively. Although there is a change in the
absorption and fluorescence intensity, no change in peak position
has been noted with the change in hydrophobic tail length of these
surfactants. It could be due to constrained structure of C-480.10,18,54 With changing the tail length
of surfactants, there may not be significant change in the polarity
of the microenvironment, but motional restriction is increased.

It
has been documented that C-480 molecules show fluorescence peak
maxima at 494, 473, 417, and 408 nm in pure water, methanol, hexane,
and cyclohexane, respectively.3 By comparing
fluorescence peak maxima of C-480 in studied micellar systems to those
in all pure solvents, one can say that the polarity of microenvironment
around C-480 is similar to that of methanol. Therefore, the C-480
molecules are mostly located in the Stern layer of micelles.3,17 To further support this, the micropolarity expressed in the form
of empirical solvent polarity parameter, ET(30) has been estimated by the reported method.10,55−57 The value of ET(30) for
the micelles of Gemini-X, -Y, and -Z is found to be 56.5 kcal mol–1, which is close to that of methanol (55.4 kcal mol–1).10 As reported earlier,10 absorption and fluorescence peak maxima of C-480
appear at 390 and 477 nm, respectively, in the micelles of Gemini-A.
It implies that there is a blue shift in the fluorescence peak position
of C-480 in the micelles of Gemini-A as compared to that in the present
micellar systems. Different values of both λmaxabs and λmaxfl of C-480 in the
micelles of Gemini-X, -Y, and -Z as compared to those in the micelles
of Gemini-A (Table 1) show the effect of hydrophilic spacer on the location of probe
molecules. The solvent polarity parameter, ET(30), for the micelles of Gemini-A is found to be 53.2 kcal
mol–1, which is lesser than that for the present
micellar systems. Li et al.49 described
that the hydrophilic spacer group can easily be located in the Stern
layer of micelles, favoring the formation of micelles. The data in Table 1 show that the cmc
value of each of Gemini-X, -Y, and -Z is lower than that of Gemini-A.10 These results infer that C-480 molecules feel
comparatively more polar environment in the micelles of surfactants
Gemini-X, -Y, and -Z with hydrophilic diethyl ether spacer group as
compared to the micelles of surfactant Gemini-A with hydrophobic tetramethylene
spacer group.

2.2 Excited Singlet-State Lifetime
Excited
singlet-state lifetime values (τf) of C-480 molecule
in the aqueous micelles of all gemini surfactants at ∼15cmc
have been determined using time-correlated single photon counting
(TCSPC) method. All decays were fitted biexponentially. The average
lifetime has been calculated using eq 1 1  where a1 and a2 are the pre-exponential factors
for the corresponding
lifetimes τ1 and τ2 of the two components.
The average lifetimes of C-480 in the all studied micelles along with
the χ2 values are given in Table 1. The lifetime values of all components along
with corresponding pre-exponential factors are given in Table S1 (Supporting Information). The lifetime values of C-480 molecules in pure solvent have been
reported earlier,10 and the values are
5.89, 4.90, and 3.13 ns in water, methanol, and cyclohexane, respectively.
By comparing the lifetime value in a particular micellar system to
that in pure solvents, one can conclude that the microenvironment
around C-480 is similar to that of methanol.

2.3 Steady-State
Anisotropy and Microviscosity
The steady-state fluorescence
anisotropies of C-480 in the micelles
of Gemini-X, -Y, and -Z have been determined, and the values obtained
along with the same in the micelles of Gemini-A reported earlier10 are given in Table 1. Using these values, the microviscosities
of environment around C-480 in all micelles have been estimated by
the method described earlier.10,58,59 The data given in Table 1 show that the microviscosity increases with increasing tail
length of the surfactants. One can also see that the microviscosities
of the micelles of Gemini-X, -Y, and -Z are greater than the microviscosity
of the micelles of Gemini-A. It is true that with increasing tail
length of the surfactants the formation of micelles becomes favored
due to enhanced hydrophobic interactions and as a result the compactness
of surfactant molecules in the micelles increases.53 In fact, it is supported by the decrease in cmc values
with increasing tail length (Table 1). The fact of increase in microviscosity has been
probed by C-480, which, however, is located in the Stern layer of
micelles. Thus, this result infers that the C-480 molecules penetrate
up to a certain depth in the Stern layer of micelles. They feel comparatively
more viscous environment with increasing tail length of the surfactants
as more compact micelle structure inhibits the penetration of water
molecules deep inside the Stern layer. Thus, compact micelle structure
has indirect effect on the microviscosity in the Stern layer of micelles.
The microviscosity of the micelles of Gemini-A is lower than that
of other three gemini due to the less compact structure of the former
than the latter. Formation of a micelle is favored by hydrophobic
attractive interactions between the tails of surfactant molecules
and disfavored by the repulsive interactions between the hydrophilic
headgroups of surfactants. These repulsive interactions are reduced
by the solvation of headgroups by the water molecules in aqueous micelles.
Therefore, in the present case, when a micelle is stabilized by a
greater extent of hydrophobic interactions between the longer tails,
the requirement of solvation of headgroups becomes less important.
In addition, the water molecules near hydrophilic spacer group are
more restricted than those near hydrophobic spacer group. These could
be the reasons for why microviscosities of micelles of Gemini-X, -Y,
and -Z are greater than the microviscosity of the micelles of Gemini-A.
The greater micropolarity of the micelles of Gemini-X, -Y, and -Z
as compared to that of the micelles of Gemini-A is because of the
presence of hydrophilic spacer groups in the former.

2.4 Solvation Dynamics
In the micelles
of all gemini surfactants, C-480 molecule exhibits wavelength-dependent
fluorescence decay. Fluorescence decays of C-480 have been recorded
at different intervals in the whole wavelength range of fluorescence
spectrum. A decay at a shorter wavelength corresponds to the fluorescence
from the unsolvated dipole created at the excited state. However,
due to the limitation of our TCSPC setup (instrument response function
= 165 ps), in the present case, there is a possibility that a high
percentage of solvated dipoles also contributes to the fast decays
observed at shorter wavelength range. However, at a longer wavelength,
the fluorescence decay is from a solvated dipole, which is delayed
by solvent relaxation process showing a clear growth in the decay.2,60Figure 3 represents
the wavelength-dependent decays of C-480 in the micelles of Gemini-X
as a representative one. Similar decays have been noticed in the micelles
of other gemini surfactants as well (Figure S1, Supporting Information). For the quantitative measurement of
solvation dynamics, the solvent response function (SRF), C(t) (eq 2), given by Fleming and Maroncelli61 has
been used 2  where υ(0), υ(t), and υ(∞)
are the peak wavenumbers at times 0, t, and ∞,
respectively. Time-resolved emission spectra
(TRES) have been constructed to determine the peak wavenumbers following
the method proposed by Fleming and Maroncelli.61 TRES for Gemini-X, -Y, and -Z are shown in Figure 4. The peak wavenumber, υ(t), for each TRES at different times was obtained after
fitting the TRES to a log–normal function.61,62 After calculating solvent response function, C(t), using eq 2, the decays of C(t) are shown
in Figure 5. The biexponential
fitting of the decay of C(t) with
time is done using eq 3 3  where τ1s and τ2s are the solvent
relaxation times and a1s and a2s are the corresponding
amplitudes. The values of solvation times obtained from the fitted
data are given in Table 2. The average solvation time ⟨τs⟩
for a biexponential decay is calculated by eq 4 and given in Table 2 4  The time-dependent
Stokes
shift occurs because of the presence of probe molecules in the Stern
layer of the micelles,63 neither for the
probes existing in the core of the micelles (no solvation)3,10 nor for the probes present in the bulk water (too fast to be detected
by the present setup).4 The fast and slow
(bimodal behavior of solvation dynamics) solvation
components (Table 2) are due to the free and bound water molecules, respectively.21 Apart from water molecules, polar headgroups,
spacer groups, and counterions may also be responsible for the solvation
of the probe molecule in the Stern layer of aqueous micelles. However,
polar headgroups are directly attached to the tails and spacer group
is indirectly attached to the tails, which restrict their mobility.
Therefore, the solvation process contributed by the headgroups and
the spacer group is very slow because it has been reported that dynamics
of polymer chains occurs in ∼100 ns time scale.3,64 Thus, water molecules and counterions are mainly responsible for
the present solvation process.

for Gemini-A are taken
from ref (10).

It has been reported that the strength
of a hydrogen bond between
water and polar headgroup is much stronger than that between two water
molecules.3,65,66 Thus, those
water molecules interacting with the polar headgroups contribute to
the slow component of solvation and the water molecules hydrogen-bonded
among themselves contribute to the fast component of solvation. The
data in Table 2 show
that fast and slow solvation times as well as average solvation time
increase with increasing tail length from C12 to C16 in Gemini-X, -Y, and -Z. In all cases, the slow components
have major contribution to the solvation than the fast component.
The reason behind this could be that water molecules taking part in
this solvation process are present deep inside the Stern layer and
are quite rigid. Rigidness of water molecules increases with increasing
tail length, which is evidenced by decrease in Stokes shift, Δυ
(Table 2). Chattopadhyay
et al.67 reported that water can penetrate
the micelles up to a certain depth depending on the compactness of
the micelle. Although the increase in solvation time is not very significant
for increase in tail length from C14 to C16,
it is comparatively more significant for increase in tail length from
C12 to C14, which is unlike conventional surfactants
studied by Sarkar et al.18 They noticed
average solvation times of 273, 286, and 341 ps for conventional surfactants
with tails C12, C14, and C16, respectively.
From these results, it can be suggested that there is a little effect
of increasing tail length on the solvation time and that this effect
is not linearly proportional to the increase in the number of carbon
atoms in the tail. On the other hand, when one compares these results
to the result of Gemini-A, it can be seen that solvation process is
much faster in Gemini-A with a larger value of Stokes shift, Δυ
(Table 2), as compared
to other three gemini surfactants. It is even faster than
that in Gemini-X, which has tails of the same length as Gemini-A.
This difference must be due to the difference in the chemical nature
of their spacer group. Results depict that solvation process in the
Stern layer is faster in case of micelles of gemini surfactants with
comparatively hydrophobic spacer group. Gemini-A micelle has a less
compact structure (hydrodynamic radius = 1.92 nm) than the other three
surfactants (hydrodynamic radius = 0.52–0.63 nm). Moreover,
hydrophobic spacer group in Gemini-A is not hydrated, whereas the
hydrophilic diethyl ether spacer group in other surfactants is easily
hydrated. Therefore, due to the presence of a greater extent of free
water molecules, the solvation dynamics in the micelles of Gemini-A
is faster than that in the micelles of other three surfactants. It
is noteworthy that although the contribution of slower component in
Gemini-A is similar to that in other three micelles, bound water molecules
contributing to the slow solvation is expected to be less rigid in
the micelles of the former than in the micelles of the latter. The
average solvation times noted in the present micelles are almost four
times longer than those in the micelles of conventional surfactants
with same tail length.18 This difference
could be due to two reasons. First, the formation of micelles by gemini
surfactants having two tails is thermodynamically more feasible; cmc
values of Gemini-X, -Y, and -Z are much smaller than those of their
conventional counterparts,18 DTAB (15 mM),
TTAB (3.5 mM), and CTAB (0.8 mM), respectively, and therefore micelles
of gemini surfactants are expected to be more compact than the micelles
of conventional surfactants. Second, the hydrophilic spacer groups
present in the present gemini surfactants easily get hydrated and
protect a significant amount of water molecules from their contact
with the probe molecules. It can be mentioned here that Shirota and
co-workers27 also found that solvation
dynamics in the micelles of anionic surfactant, sodium alkyl sulfate
(Cn = 8, 10, 12, and 14), and cationic
surfactant, alkyltrimethylammonium bromide (Cn = 10, 12, 14, and 16) becomes slower with increasing alkyl
chain length.

As there is a limitation of time resolution of
our TCSPC setup
(instrument response function = 165 ps), we are unable to detect a
percentage of ultrafast solvation. The quantification of these missing
components has been done following the method proposed by Fee and
Maroncelli,61,68 and the values are listed in Table 2.

To further
support the fact that the hydrophilic spacer groups
present in the gemini surfactants protect a certain amount of water
molecules from their contact with the probe molecule, C-480, we have
carried out a fluorescence experiment by forming micelles in the water–methanol
mixture. In our previous study52 and also
a study carried out by other groups,69 it
has been observed that significant change in cmc values or change
in the size of micelles occurred when the percentage of an organic
cosolvent especially hydrogen-bond-donating solvent in water–organic
solvent mixture is above 20%. Keeping this in mind, we have recorded
fluorescence spectra of C-480 in pure water and also in the presence
of various percentages of organic cosolvent not exceeding 20%. In
this experiment, we wanted to see the extent of interactions between
the −OH group of methanol and C-480. Figure 6a shows that in the presence of 15cmc of
Gemini-A the fluorescence peak maximum gets red-shifted from 477 to
480 nm on increasing the percentage of methanol up to 20%. On the
other hand, Figure 6b shows that there is no change in the fluorescence peak maximum
for the same increase in the percentage of methanol in case of 15cmc
of Gemini-X. This result is a clear evidence of protection of molecules
containing −OH groups by hydrophilic spacer group from their
contact with the probe molecule.

Gemini-A and (b) 15cmc

mixture; λex = 375 nm.

We have also carried out 1H NMR spectroscopic
study
to demonstrate the interactions between spacer part of gemini surfactants
and water molecules. The 1H NMR spectra of Gemini-A, -X,
-Y, and -Z have been recorded in D2O as solvent. A detailed
discussion in this regard is given below for Gemini-A and Gemini-X.
The same is true for Gemini-Y and Gemini-Z as well. The chemical shifts
for the S1 protons and S2 protons (Scheme 1) of Gemini-A are
observed to be at δ 3.34 and 1.81, respectively, in D2O, whereas those for Gemini-X are found to be at δ 3.59 and
3.95, respectively, in D2O. The 1H NMR spectra
of Gemini-A and Gemini-X in D2O are given in Figure 7a and b, respectively, and
data are given in Note 1 in Supporting Information. Both S1 and S2 protons are more deshielded
in Gemini-X as compared to Gemini-A. It has been reported in the literature70,71 that in the presence of an electronegative atom in a molecule close
to a proton the latter becomes more acidic, resulting in showing a
downfield 1H NMR signal, which is observed in the present
case as well. It is also noteworthy
that S1 protons are more deshielded as compared to S2 protons in case of Gemini-A, whereas S2 protons
are more deshielded as compared to S1 protons for Gemini-X.
Because of the presence of an oxygen atom in between two carbon atoms
in the spacer of Gemini-X, S2 protons are acidic in nature
making those protons highly deshielded. Therefore, it is expected
that the extent of H-bonding between a proton in the spacer and water
molecule would be more in case of Gemini-X as compared to Gemini-A.
Thus, the presence of oxygen atom in the spacer group of Gemini-X
can protect the water molecules from their contact with the probe
molecules present in the inner side of the micelles to a greater extent
as compared to Gemini-A. The 1H NMR spectra of Gemini-Y
and -Z in D2O are given in Figure S2, and the data are given in Note 1 in Supporting Information. These data are also in
the same line as Gemini-X. Thus, 1H NMR spectroscopy results
support our above-mentioned discussion that the hydrophilic spacer
has effect on the rate of solvation dynamics in the micelles.

2.5 Time-Resolved Fluorescence Anisotropy
To have better idea about the microenvironment of micelles, time-resolved
fluorescence anisotropy measurements of C-480 have been carried out
in micellar media. The time-resolved fluorescence anisotropy, r(t), values have been calculated by eq 5 5  where I∥(t) and I⊥(t) are the fluorescence decays polarized parallel and perpendicular
to the polarization of the excitation light, respectively. G is the correction factor for detector sensitivity to the
polarization detection of emission. The G factor
for the present instrument setup is ∼0.6. The anisotropy decays
in the micelles of Gemini-A, -X, -Y, and -Z are shown in Figure 8. Although the anisotropy
decay of C-480 is found to be single exponential in water, it is biexponential
in micellar media. Earlier, we have reported that the anisotropy decay
of C-480 in pure water is single exponential with rotational relaxation
time of 132 ps.10 The biexponential anisotropy
decay has been fitted to the decay function represented by eq 6 6  where r0 is the
limiting value of anisotropy to represent the inherent depolarization
of the probe molecule, τ1r and τ2r are the time constants for the fast and slow rotational relaxation
components, respectively, and a1r and a2r are relative amplitudes of these two components,
respectively. The rotational relaxation times for the fast and slow
components have been calculated from the fitted decay. The following
equation (eq 7) has been
used to estimate the average rotational relaxation time 7  where τ1r and τ2r are the rotational relaxation times and a1r and a2r are the corresponding
amplitudes. The values of rotational relaxation times for the fast
and slow components along with average rotational relaxation time
are given in Table 3. Longer rotational relaxation time in a micellar environment as
compared to pure water represents that the free rotational motions
of C-480 in water get restricted in micelles. The rotational relaxation
data for C-480 in the micelles of Gemini-A obtained in our previous
study10 are also given in Figure 8 and Table 3 for the purpose of comparison.

Data in Table 3 show
that both fast and slow relaxation times along with average relaxation
time increase with increasing tail length of surfactants. This result
can be corroborated with the increase in microviscosity of micelles
with increasing tail length. Recently, Samanta et al.32 have found that the rotational dynamics of 4-aminopthalimide
(4-AP) becomes slower when the chain length of the cationic part of N-alkyl-N-methylmorpholinium ionic liquid
increases. It can be noted that the fast component has major contribution
(61–71%) to the fluorescence depolarization, whereas the slow
component has minor contribution (29–39%) in each micellar
system. Although C-480 is apparently present in a rigid environment,
the presence of fast motions responsible for the loss of anisotropy
is evidenced by the values of time-zero anisotropy, ro = 0.30, 0.31, and 0.31 for Gemini-X, -Y, and -Z, respectively,
which are less than the maximum possible value of ro = 0.40.60 One can note that
the change in average relaxation time is more for increasing tail
length from C14 to C16 than that for C12 to C14, which is unlike solvation time. As expected,
the relaxation time is lower in case of micelles of Gemini-A as compared
to micelles of other surfactants due to lower microviscosity of the
former than the latter.46 It has been discussed
above that the slow solvation component has major contribution to
the solvation dynamics of C-480 in the Stern layer. Thus, these results
infer that although solvation dynamics is a slow process, C-480 molecules
are quite freely movable deep inside the Stern layer of micelles.
In a complex micellar environment, the rate of rotational relaxation
process may be directly correlated with microviscosity, but it may
not be true for the rate of solvation process. Sarkar et al.18 reported that the average rotational relaxation
times for C-480 in the micelles of conventional surfactants with C12, C14, and C16 tails are 481, 687,
and 812 ps, respectively. However, in the present surfactant systems
with hydrophilic spacer groups, these values are almost 1.5 times
longer. It is even longer in the presence of hydrophobic spacer group
as well. Thus, the presence of spacer group in a gemini surfactant
makes the rotational relaxation process slower in more compact micelles
with higher microviscosity as compared to their conventional counterparts.

The observed biexponential behavior of the anisotropy decay is
not due to the different location of the probe molecule in the micelles
but due to the different types of rotational motions.72,73 This type of bimodal anisotropy decay is well explained by a two-step
model and a wobbling-in-a-cone model73,74 (Note 2, Supporting Information). The two-step
model explains that the slow relaxation time (τ2r) can be related to the times corresponding to the tumbling motion
of the micelle as a whole (τm) and the lateral diffusion
(τD) of the probe along the micelle surface following
the relation (eq 8) 8  where τm is calculated following
the Debye–Stokes–Einstein equation using the value of
hydrodynamic radius of micelle (Note 3, Supporting Information). The hydrodynamic radii (rh) estimated in the present study and size distribution plots
of all three micellar media are given in Table 4 and Figure S3 (Supporting Information), respectively.
The τm values have been calculated using eq S1 (Supporting Information) and τD values have been calculated using the values
of τm and eq 8 at 298.15 K and are tabulated in Table 4. By comparing the values of τD (Table 4)
to the values of slow rotational relaxation time (τ2r) (Table 3), one can
see that these values are almost same. Therefore, the slow rotational
relaxation is mainly due to the lateral diffusion of the probe along
the surface of the micelle. The time constant for the lateral diffusion
of the probe increases with increasing tail length of the gemini surfactants,
that is, with increasing microviscosity of micelles. The tumbling
motion of the micelle as a whole is much slower than the lateral diffusion
of the probe in the micelle. As expected, the time constant for the
overall motion of the micelle increases with increasing size of the
micelle. The time constant for the wobbling motion (τw) of C-480 in the micelles has been calculated using eq S2 (Note 4, Supporting Information). The calculated τw values are
also tabulated in Table 4. The wobbling motion time (τw) is a measurement
of relaxation of local structure in a micelle. The value of τw increases with increasing microviscosity of micelles.

Gemini-Z	0.63	475	226	2890	4.55	49.3	0.54	
Applying the wobbling-in-a-cone model73 (Note 5, Supporting Information), the
values of wobbling diffusion coefficient (Dw), order parameter (|S|), and cone angle (θo) have been calculated using eqs S3–S5, respectively, to have further information about the motional restriction
of C-480 molecules within the micelles. The values obtained are summarized
in Table 4. A large
value (greater than 0.5) of spatial restriction parameter (|S|) shows that the probe molecules are located in a restricted
environment. The higher values of θo and lower values
of (|S|) for Gemini-Y and -Z as compared to Gemini-X
might be indicating that the wobbling-in-a-cone model is not suitable
for micelles with high microviscosity. To resolve this apparent discrepancy,
often a spinning-in-equatorial-band model75,76 is used. However, in the present case, it is not applicable as for
this model the value of |S| should be less than 0.5.
The possible reason could be that the probe molecule is aligned in
such a way that the emission moment is neither perpendicular to the
long axis like that in the spinning-in-equatorial-band model nor parallel
to the long axis like that in the wobbling-in-a-cone model but oriented
in between these two possibilities. More importantly, the orientation
of C-480 molecules in more viscous Gemini-Y and Gemini-Z micelles
is possibly different from that in Gemini-X micelles.

It is
noteworthy that
hydrodynamic radii data show that the micelles are spherical in nature
and that is why we could use two-step and wobbling-in-a-cone models
as they are applicable for spherical micelles. Data also show that
size variation is not very large. Therefore, there is no chance of
effect of aggregation states, that
is, change in micellar shapes from spherical to wormlike or so on,
solvation dynamics, or rotational relaxation. Also, concentration
of surfactant taken is much higher than cmc, so there would be hardly
any chance of existence of premicellar aggregates.

3 Conclusions
The present study demonstrates the effect of
hydrophobicity of
tails and hydrophilicity of the spacer group of gemini surfactants
on the rates of solvation and rotational relaxation processes of C-480
in aqueous micelles. Study shows that C-480 molecules are located
in the Stern layer. Micelles become progressively more compact with
increasing hydrocarbon tail length, which results in lesser extent
of penetration of water molecules, thereby increasing microviscosity
of the micelles. The rate of solvation process becomes lower with
increasing microviscosity of micelles with slow solvation as a major
component. It infers that C-480 molecules are located inside the Stern
layer of micelles and water molecules become progressively more rigid
with increasing compactness of micelles. Micelles with hydrophilic
spacer group like diethyl ether in the present case are more compact
than those with hydrophobic spacer group. Moreover, hydrophilic spacer
group gets easily hydrated. Therefore, the microviscosity of micelles
of a gemini surfactant with hydrophobic spacer group is lower than
that of micelles with hydrophilic spacer group. Also, the extent of
free water molecules is more in the Stern layer of micelles of the
former than that of the latter. As a result, solvation dynamics is
faster in case of micelles of gemini surfactants with hydrophobic
spacer. The rate of rotational relaxation process also decreases with
increasing hydrocarbon tail length of surfactants as a result of increased
microviscosity of micelles. However, unlike solvation process, the
fast rotational motion is a major component for depolarization. Thus,
although solvation process is slow, the rotational motion of C-480
is quite feasible inside the Stern layer of a compact micelle. More
compact micelles are formed with increased hydrophilicity of the spacer
group of gemini surfactants, which results in decrease in the rate
of rotational relaxation process. The hydrophilic spacer group of
gemini molecules protects the water molecules from their easy contact
with the probe molecules present inside the Stern layer and also favors
the formation of compact micelle. That is why solvation and rotational
relaxation processes are almost 4 and 1.5 times longer in case of
present micelles of surfactants with hydrophilic spacer groups as
compared to micelles of their conventional counterparts, respectively.
Thus, the spacer group of a gemini surfactant has an effect on the
rates of solvation and rotational relaxation processes in the micelles
and the effect is more pronounced in the case of solvation process.
The slow rotational component is mainly due to the lateral diffusion
of the probe along the surface of micelle. The tumbling motion of
micelles as a whole is a very slow process as compared to the lateral
diffusion of the probe, and the time constant for the former motion
increases with increasing size of the micelle. Both wobbling motion
and lateral diffusion of the probe become slower with increasing microviscosity
of micelles. There is an indication of different orientation of probe
molecules in the micelles of high microviscosity.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials
The
detailed procedures
for the synthesis of cationic gemini surfactants and their characterization
have been reported earlier.53 In addition,
a detailed NMR analysis has been carried out afterward to further
check the purity of synthesized surfactants (Note 6, Supporting Information). C-480 was procured from Exciton
laser grade and used as received. All organic solvents used in spectral
measurements were from Spectrochem Chemical Company, India, and were
of spectroscopic grades. To record the lamp profile in TCSPC measurements,
Ludox in aqueous medium was used as a scatterer, details of which
are available elsewhere.12

4.2 Methods
The concentration of gemini
surfactants used for the present study has been kept 15 times of their
respective cmc values to ensure that all probe molecules are completely
solubilized in micelles.10 With these concentrations
of surfactants, we did not notice any excitation-wavelength-dependent
fluorescence peak maxima further supporting the fact of complete solubilization
of probe molecules. The stock solution of C-480 was prepared in UV-grade
methanol as solvent. The final concentration of C-480 was set at 5
μM in all experimental solutions. The details of the method
of preparation of solutions are given elsewhere.10 Milli-Q water has been used to prepare all aqueous solution
for spectral measurements. The UV–visible absorption and fluorescence
spectra of C-480 in aqueous micelles were recorded with JASCO V-630
UV–visible spectrophotometer and Horiba Jobin Yvon FluoroMax-4
scanning spectrofluorometer, respectively. Other details of these
measurements have been reported earlier.10,12 Steady-state fluorescence anisotropy measurements were carried out
with the same instrument using additional polarizer attachment.10 The excited-state lifetimes were recorded from
intensity decays using a Horiba Jobin Yvon FluoroCube-01-NL picosecond
time-correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) experimental setup.
A detailed description is available in our previous publication.10,12,77 An identical setup was used to
analyze the time-resolved anisotropy measurements as well. The time
constants for solvation process have been determined after constructing
the TRES and calculating the solvent response function, C(t), following the method described by Fleming and
Maroncelli,61 details of which are available
elsewhere.12 As mentioned above, the same
TCSPC setup has been used for the determination of the time-resolved
fluorescence anisotropy, r(t), which
has been calculated using eq 5. To measure the hydrodynamic radii of the micelles, dynamic
light scattering (DLS) measurements were carried out using Zetasizer
Nano ZS (ZEN 3600; Malvern Instruments, U.K.).10 The corresponding G function was considered
with care to judge the size distribution. 1H NMR spectra
were recorded on a Bruker Avance instrument (400 MHz). All spectral
measurements were performed at 298.15 ± 1 K.
