Carbon bond and hydrogen bond are
common noncovalent interactions;
although recent advances on these interactions have been achieved
in both the experimental and computational aspects, little is known
about the conversion mechanism between them. Here, MP2 calculations
with aug-cc-pVDZ basis set (aug-cc-pVDZ-pp for element Sn) were used
to optimize the geometric configurations of the hydrogen-bonded complexes
MH3F···HCN (M = C, Si, Ge, and Sn), carbon-bonded
complexes HCN···MH3F (M = C, Si, Ge, and
Sn), and transition states; the conversion mechanism between these
two types of interactions has been carried out. The molecular electrostatic
potential, especially the σ-hole, is directly related to the
flatten degree of intrinsic reaction coordinate (IRC) curve. The energy
barriers from the hydrogen-bonded complexes to the carbon-bonded complexes
are 6.99, 7.73, 10.56, and 13.59 kJ·mol–1.
The energy barriers from the carbon-bonded complexes to the hydrogen-bonded
complexes are 4.65, 7.81, 9.10, and 13.04 kJ·mol–1. The breakage and formation of the bonds along the reaction paths
have been discussed by the topological analysis of electronic density.
The energy barriers are obviously related to the width of the structure
transition region (STR). For the first derivative curve of IRC energy
surface versus reaction coordinate, there is a maximum peak and a
minimum peak, reflecting the structural transition states in the ring
STRs.

Introduction
Noncovalent interactions1−5 play a special role in supramolecular chemistry, molecular biology,
and materials science.6−10 There are a range of different noncovalent forces and various ways
of classifying them, such as halogen bond,10−14 chalcogen bond,15,16 pnicogen bond,17−19 and so on. Specifically, the hydrogen bond is perhaps most widely
recognized and analyzed because of its importance in chemical, physical,
and biological processes.20−22 The hydrogen bond acceptors are
commonly expected to be an electronegative atom, such as O, N, and
F atoms.20,23,24 Now, various
groups such as fluoromethyl group and fluorinated organic compounds25−27 acting as the hydrogen bond acceptors have attracted more attention.
In recent years, the newly discovered noncovalent interaction, carbon
bond, has been more widely recognized.28−31 The carbon bond can be represented
as X–C···Y, where X–C is the carbon bond
donor fragment and Y is the carbon bond acceptor.32,33 The above two interactions of hydrogen bond and carbon bond are
widely studied both in experimental and computational aspects.

In previous works, researchers have focused more attention on the
characteristics and properties of different noncovalent interactions,
such as X–C···π interactions,28 XH3F···HM (X = C,
Si, Ge, and Sn; M = Li, Na, BeH, and MgH) tetrel–hydride interaction,34 XH3F···N3–/OCN–/SCN–(X = C, Si, Ge, and Sn) interactions,35 and so on.36,37 However, studies on further mechanism
and structural transformation are seldom.38−40

The atoms
in molecules (AIM) theory,41−43 which is rooted in quantum
mechanics, has been widely applied to study the chemical bonds and
chemical reactions. In our previous works,44−46 some typical
isomerization reactions have been studied, investigating the structure
changes along the reaction pathways. Two concepts of structure transition
region (STR) and structure transition state (STS) were put forward
by us. Along the reaction pathway, there are two possible possibilities:
one is the T-shaped conflict STS that includes a bond path linking
a nuclear and a bond critical point (BCP), the other is the bifurcation-type
ring STR enveloped by some bond paths contributing from three or more
nuclei. For comparison, we named the traditional transitional state
corresponding to the maximum on the reaction pathway as the “energy
transition state” (ETS).

In this work, we choose MH3F (M = C, Si, Ge, and Sn)
and NCH as an investigated subject. On the basis of an analysis on
the positive and negative electrostatic potential (ESP) regions of
MH3F (M = C, Si, Ge, and Sn), the hydrogen-bonded complexes
of MH3F···HCN (M = C, Si, Ge, and Sn) and
the carbon-bonded complexes of HCN···MH3F (M = C, Si, Ge, and Sn) were constructed, to investigate (1) the
hydrogen-bonded interaction between MH3F and NCH; (2) the
carbon-bonded interaction between MH3F and NCH; (3) the
conversion mechanism between the hydrogen-bonded complexes of MH3F···HCN (M = C, Si, Ge, and Sn) and the carbon-bonded
complexes of HCN···MH3F (M = C, Si, Ge,
and Sn); (4) the topological structural changes between the conversion
processes, (5) the relationship of the reaction barriers and the STRs,
and (6) the relationship of the energy surface and STS.

Theoretical Methods
The geometric configurations of hydrogen-bonded complexes, carbon-bonded
complexes, and transition states (TSs) formed by MH3F (M
= C, Si, Ge, and Sn) with NCH were optimized by aug-cc-pVDZ47,48 basis set (aug-cc-pVDZ-pp for element Sn) with the Møller–Plesset49−51 second-order perturbation (MP2) theory. At the same time, the interaction
energy was obtained by basis set superposition error using the counterpoise
procedure proposed by Boys and Bernardi’s.52,53 The truthfulness of the TS is determined by the vibration frequency
analysis, and the intrinsic reaction coordinates (IRCs)54 are used to verify the relationship between
hydrogen-bonded complexes, TSs, and carbon-bonded complexes. In this
work, the reaction paths were traced out by the mass-weighted internal
coordinate (S), which is more precise than simply
using the length of the bond and the angle.55,56

Topological analyses of electron density were used to analyze
the
breaking, generating, and changing trends of chemical bonds at the
key points on the IRC paths, which are carried out with AIMAll program.57 ESPs were obtained and depicted on the 0.001
a.u. (electrons/bohr3) contour of the molecule’s
electronic density at the same level after geometry optimization using
the wave function analysis surface analysis suite,58,59 which provides a fundamental basis for the conversion mechanism60 between the hydrogen-bonded complexes of MH3F···HCN (M = C, Si, Ge, and Sn) and the carbon-boned
complexes of HCN···MH3F (M = C, Si, Ge,
and Sn). Geometry optimization of each point along the IRC pathway
was carried out at the MP2/aug-cc-pVDZ level using Gaussian 09 program
package.61

Results and Discussion
Molecular
ESPs of the Monomers
The molecular ESPs (MEP)
of MH3F (M = C, Si, Ge, and Sn) and NCH are displayed in Figure 1. For NCH, the most
positive and negative ESP (VS,max and VS,min) exist outside the H atom and the N atom,
respectively. For MH3F (M = C, Si, Ge, and Sn), the negative
ESP region exists outside the F atom, owing to the strong electronegativity
of F. For CH3F, there are two VS,min positions outside two sides of F atom with the same value −27.63
kcal·mol–1. For SiH3F, GeH3F, and SnH3F, the VS,min exists
outside the F atom along the extension of M–F bond, with the
values −26.55, −28.34, and −40.20 kcal·mol–1, respectively. The outside of M atom (M = C, Si,
Ge, and Sn) is surrounded by the positive ESP regions along the extension
of F–M bond; these regions (red regions) are called σ-holes,
with the most positive ESP (VS,max) appearing
at the bottom of the M atom. The VS,max values are 24.06, 45.02, 45.65, and 60.15 kcal·mol–1, increasing gradually according to the atomic number of the main
group element M = C, Si, Ge, and Sn. The corresponding ESP values
are presented in Table 1.

Equilibrium Geometries
and Interaction Energies of Hydrogen-Bonded
Complexes and Carbon-Bonded Complexes
On the basis of the
analysis of the surface ESP of the above molecules, we can predict
the binding sites for the formation of the hydrogen-bonded complexes
and carbon-bonded complexes. As shown in Figure 2, the first way of interacting is the H···F
hydrogen-bonded interaction. The hydrogen atom of NCH acts as the
hydrogen bond donor, and the F atom of MH3F (M = C, Si,
Ge, and Sn), which contains lone pair electrons, acts as the hydrogen
bond acceptor. Therefore, the H···N hydrogen-bonded
interaction is formed, namely, MH3F (M = C, Si, Ge, and
Sn)···HCN. The second way of interacting is the N···M
carbon-bonded interaction. The σ-hole outside the M atom of
MH3F (M = C, Si, Ge, and Sn) acts as the carbon bond donor,
and the nitrogen atom of NCH, containing lone pair electrons with
a large negative ESP region, acts as the carbon bond acceptor. Therefore,
the group IV σ-hole interaction was constructed. We refer to
the group IV σ-hole interactions as carbon-bonded interaction,
that is, HCN···MH3F (M = C, Si, Ge, and
Sn).

Figure 2 Optimized geometries for hydrogen-bonded complexes of MH3F···HCN (M = C, Si, Ge, and Sn) and carbon-bonded
complexes of HCN···MH3F (M = C, Si, Ge,
and Sn).

The most negative ESP (VS,min) of CH3F is on the side of
the F atom; the hydrogen-bonded interaction
of CH3F···HCN is formed on the side of the
F atom. The carbon-bonded interaction is combined at the top of the
F atom and M (M = C, Si, Ge, and Sn) atom. In addition to CH3F···HCN, all of the geometries in this work belong
to C3v symmetry. The
interaction energies ΔE are collected in Table 2. When MH3F (M = C, Si, Ge, and Sn) and NCH interact to form the hydrogen-bonded
complexes and carbon-bonded complexes, the interaction energies ΔE are in accordance with the VS,max of the positive ESP described above.

For comparison with the MP2
results, ωB97XD calculations
were also carried out with the same level basis set of MP2 and the
interaction energies are also listed in Table 2. For the hydrogen-bonded complexes MH3F···HCN (M = C, Si, and Ge) and carbon-bonded
complexes of HCN···MH3F (M = C, Si, and
Ge), the interaction energies obtained by MP2 method (ΔEa) and ωB97XD method (ΔEb) are close. However, For SnH3F···HCN
and HCN···SnH3F, the interaction energies
calculated by the ωB97XD method are obviously greater.

On the basis of the MP2/aug-cc-pVDZ optimized geometries, the CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pVTZ
method was used to carry out only single point energy corrections;
the obtained interaction energies (ΔEc) is also listed in Table 2. Compared with MP2 results (ΔEa), CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pVTZ calculated interaction energies are
greater.

For more insight into the nature of the hydrogen-bonded
complexes
and the carbon-bonded complexes, energy decomposition analyses were
carried out by means of the LMOEDA method62 with the GAMESS program;63 the results
are collected in Table S1. Comparing the
three attractive terms [electrostatic energy (ES), polarization energy
(POL), and dispersion energy (DISP)], the ES contributes the most
in both the hydrogen-bonded complexes and the carbon-bonded complexes.

Conversion Mechanism between the Hydrogen-Bonded Complexes and
Carbon-Bonded Complexes
What kind of conversion mechanism
has been experienced between the two types of noncovalent interactions,
and what is the relationship between them? In this work, the TSs of
the conversion reaction have been found. For each of the optimized
TS, frequency analysis is carried out to confirm that there exists
one and only one imaginary frequency. Furthermore, the vibration model
is analyzed, and the reliability of TS is determined. The relationship
between the hydrogen-bonded complexes, the TSs, and the carbon-bonded
complexes is obtained through the calculation of IRCs. The optimized
geometries of the TSs are given in Figure 3.

Figure 3 Optimized geometries of TSs of MH3F (M = C, Si, Ge,
and Sn) with HCN.

The energy barriers of
the conversion reactions are obtained and
displayed in Figure 4, and the relative energies are listed in Table 3. From the hydrogen-bonded complexes to the
carbon-bonded complexes, MH3F···HCN →
MF-TS → HCN···MH3F (M = C, Si, Ge,
and Sn), the reaction energies are 6.99, 7.73, 10.56, and 13.59 kJ·mol–1, respectively. From the carbon-bonded complexes to
the hydrogen-bonded complexes, HCN···MH3F → MF-TS → MH3F···HCN (M
= C, Si, Ge, and Sn), the reaction energies are 4.65, 7.81, 9.10,
and 13.04 kJ·mol–1, respectively. The reaction
energy barrier increases gradually along the increased atomic number
of main group elements M = C, Si, Ge, and Sn.

Natural Bond Orbital Analysis of the TSs
From Figure 1, compared with the
ESP distribution of the Si/Ge/SnH3F surface, there is no
strong positive hole outside the F atom of CH3F. In order
to understand the role of the ESP in the formation of TS and the energy
barriers in the conversion process, the charge transfer and orbitals
of the TSs were calculated by the natural bond orbital analysis. Figure 5 shows the donor
and acceptor orbitals on the 0.015 isosurface. The red region and
blue region represent the positive and negative phases of the wave
function, respectively. It is observed that the lone pair orbitals
of N atom in NCH overlap with the M–H (M = Si, Ge, and Sn)
antibond orbitals, and the overlapping regions are increasing along
the sequence of M = Si, Ge, and Sn.

Figure 5 Charge-transfer diagram between the donor
and the acceptor orbitals
on the 0.015 isosurface: (a) SiF-TS, (b) GeF-TS, and (c) SnF-TS.

Table 4 shows the
natural bond orbital parameters for the TSs. In the TS CF-TS, the
effective value of charge transfer from lone pair electrons of N atom
to the C–H antibond is not obtained because the combination
of CF-TS is mainly electrostatic interaction. With the increase of
atomic number of group IV, it is gradually shown that the lone pair
electrons of the N atom in the NCH molecule transfer to the Si/Ge/Sn–H
antibond, which can be concluded that the TS Si/Ge/Sn-TS interaction
also has partial charge transfer in addition to the electrostatic
interaction. The charge-transfer quantities qCT’s are 0.00009e, 0.00014e, 0.00038e.

Topological Analyses of
Electronic Density on IRC Paths
The quantum theory of “AIM”,41−43 proposed by
Bader, has been applied broadly and successfully to study the properties
of intra- and intermolecular interactions. Topological analyses for
each stagnation point on reaction path can provide valuable information,
by studying related information such as electron density at the critical
point, the strength, and the properties of the chemical bond, to further
analyze the conversion process.

Topological Analyses of
Electronic Density on Reaction Channels
of CH3F···HCN → CF-TS → HCN···CH3F
Electronic density parameters at the critical points
for the transformation path from the hydrogen-bonded complexes to
the carbon-bonded complexes formed by CH3F and HCN are
given in Table 5. The
representative topological graphs for some points along the IRC path
are plotted in Figure 6. First of all, the electron density ρb at the critical
points of the F···H hydrogen bond formed by F atom
of CH3F and the H atom of NCH gradually decreases, indicating
that the hydrogen bond becomes weaker and weaker. At the point S = −13.44, there exists a bond path between the
F atom and the BCP of the C–N bond, forming a T-shaped structure.
After that point, the F···H hydrogen bond is broken
and the F···C bond forms. The ring critical point (RCP)
appears in the reaction process of S = −12.23
to S = −9.78, indicating the formation of
the C–F–C–N four-membered ring. With the proceeding
of the reaction, the electron density ρb at the BCP
of the F···C bond becomes smaller and the RCP moves
to the center of the ring and then gradually approaches the F···C
bond. At the point of S = −9.78, the RCP overlapped
with the BCP of F···C bond and the F···C
bond is broken and the four-membered ring disappeared.

In the region of S = −2.74
to S = +5.91, the RCP appears again and another C–H–N–H
four-membered ring exists. The traditional ETS,44 appearing at S = 0.00, is included in
this region. At this point, the electron density at the BCP of H···N
bond was the smallest and this structure is very unstable. In this
process, the C···N bond path becomes more and more
bent and begins to expand slowly to the two sides to form H···N
hydrogen bond and then back up again to form a stable C···N
bond. Finally, the stable carbon-bonded complex HCN···CH3F is formed. The process from S = −2.74
to S = +5.91 is consistent with the change of the
ESP around CH3F. Through the observation of the ESP, the
positive ESP regions outside three H atoms of CH3F molecule
can serve as the electron acceptor, N atom of NCH with lone pair electrons
can be used as electron donor, and the H···N hydrogen
bond is formed possibly by the N atom with each of the three H atoms
of CH3F.

Figure 7 gives the
structures along the IRC path of CH3F···HCN
→ HCN···CH3F (a) and the first derivative
curve of energy versus reaction coordinate (b). For the first derivative
curve, there is a maximum peak corresponding to the structure of S = −11.01 and a minimum peak corresponding to the
structure of S = +5.91. The points of S = −11.01 and S = +5.91 lie on the deepest
positions uphill and downhill the energy curve, reflecting the STSs
in the ring STRs.

Figures 8 and 9 display the topological graphs for the key points along the IRC
paths of the Si/GeH3F···HCN → Si/GeF-TS
→ HCN···Si/GeH3F processes; the corresponding
electronic density parameters at the critical points are listed in Tables 6 and 7. The initial changing process of the F···H
bond is similar to the F···H bond formed by the above
CH3F and NCH; the difference is that the F···C
bond path slips along the C–N bond of NCH and changes to the
F···N bond; therefore, the Si/Ge–F–C–N
four-membered ring changes to the Si/Ge–F–N three-membered
ring. As the process goes on, the RCP moves to the center of the ring;
when the RCP goes to the BCP of F···N bond, the F–N
bond is broken and the three-membered ring disappears.

For the SiH3F···HCN →
SiF-TS →
HCN···SiH3F process, in the region of S = −6.16 to S = +9.89, the structural
transition region of a Si–H–N–H four-membered
ring exists. For the GeH3F···HCN →
GeF-TS → HCN···GeH3F process, in
the region of S = −3.34 to S = +7.31, the structural transition region of a Ge–H–N–H
four-membered ring appears. In the above process, the Si/Ge–N
bond path becomes more and more bent, expands slowly to the two sides
to form H···N hydrogen bonds, and then back up again
to form a stable Si/Ge–N bond. These changes are in good agreement
with the changes of the ESP around Si/GeH3F. At the point
of S = 0.00 (ETS), the electron density at the BCP
of H···N bond was the smallest and this structure is
very unstable. Therefore, the above-mentioned reaction channels have
two four-membered ring structural transition regions, that is, Si/Ge–F–C–N
ring and Si/Ge–H–N–H ring, and a three membered-ring
structural transition region, namely, Si/Ge–F–N ring.
As the reaction proceeds, a stable carbon-bonded complex is formed,
that is, HCN···Si/GeH3F.

Figures 10 and 11 show the structures along the IRC path of Si/GeH3F···HCN → HCN···Si/GeH3F (a) and the first derivative curve of energies versus reaction
coordinates (b). For the first derivative curve of SiH3F···HCN → HCN···SiH3F, there is a maximum peak corresponding to the structure of S = −18.42 and a minimum peak corresponding to the
structure of S = +9.52. For the first derivative
curve of GeH3F···HCN → HCN···GeH3F, there is a maximum peak corresponding to the structure
of S = −21.80 and a minimum peak corresponding
to the structure of S = +10.26. These points reflect
the STSs in the ring STRs.

Topological Analyses of Electronic Density on Reaction Channels
of SnH3F···HCN → SnF-TS →
HCN···SnH3F
Figure 12 displays the topological graphs for the
IRC path of SnH3F···HCN → SnF-TS
→ HCN···SnH3F, and the corresponding
electronic density parameters at the critical points are listed in Table 8. This process is
relatively simple compared with the above three reaction channels
of C/Si/GeH3F···HCN → SnF-TS →
HCN···SnH3F. First of all, the STR of the
Sn–F–C–N four-membered ring is changed to the
Sn–F–N three-membered ring structure. As the reaction
goes on, the RCP is gradually close to the F···N bond.
At the point of S = −21.05, the F···N
bond is broken and the Sn–F–N three-membered ring disappears
and only the Sn···N bond is left. The electron density
at the BCP of Sn···N bond decreases gradually, and
the electron density reaches the minimum in the ETS SnF-TS (S = 0.00). Finally, NCH moves to the bottom Sn atom of the
SnH3F to form the stable carbon-bonded complex HCN···SnH3F.

The SnH3F···HCN →
SnF-TS →
HCN···SnH3F process does not form the H···N
bond and does not experience the Sn–H–N–H structural
transition region, which is related to the ESP of SnH3F.
Observing the ESP of SnH3F, it can be found that there
is a large positive ESP region around the Sn atom. As the reaction
continues, the N atom in the NCH could interact with the positive
ESP region to form the σ-hole interaction, instead of extending
to both sides to form the H–N bond.

Figure 13 shows
the structures along the IRC path of SnH3F···HCN
→ HCN···SnH3F (a) and the first derivative
curve of energies versus reaction coordinates (b). For the first derivative
curve of SnH3F···HCN → HCN···SnH3F, there is a maximum peak corresponding to the structure
of S = −24.84 and a minimum peak corresponding
to the structure of S = +15.01, reflecting the STSs
in the ring STRs.

Relationship of the Energy Barriers and the Width of the STR
Table 9 summarizes
the width of the STRs of M–F–C–N/M–F–N
ring. It can be observed that the energy barriers are obviously related
to the width of the STR. The larger the energy barriers, the wider
the ring STR.

Conclusions
(1) On the basis of
the analysis of the
ESP, there are two ways of MH3F (M = C, Si, Ge, and Sn)
interacting with NCH. The first way of combining is the hydrogen-bonded
interaction, namely, MH3F···HCN (M = C,
Si, Ge, and Sn). The second way of combining is the carbon-bonded
interaction, that is, HCN···MH3F (M = C,
Si, Ge, and Sn).

(2) The
TSs from the hydrogen-bonded complexes
to the carbon-bonded complexes were found, and IRC calculations were
carried out to verify the conversion mechanism. The molecular ESP,
especially the σ-hole, is directly related to the flatten degree
of IRC curve.

(3) The breakage
and formation of the
bonds along the reaction paths have been discussed by the topological
analysis of electronic density. The energy barriers are obviously
related to the width of the STR. For the first derivative curve of
IRC energy surface versus reaction coordinate, there is a maximum
peak and a minimum peak, reflecting the STSs in the ring structural
transition regions.
