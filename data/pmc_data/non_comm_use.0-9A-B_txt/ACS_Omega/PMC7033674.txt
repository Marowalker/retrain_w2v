Rice and wheat husks
were converted to biochars by slow pyrolysis
(1 h) at 600 °C. Iron oxide rice husk hybrid biochar (RHIOB)
and wheat husk hybrid biochar (WHIOB) were synthesized by copyrolysis
of FeCl3-impregnated rice or wheat husks at 600 °C.
These hybrid sorbents were characterized using X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy (SEM),
SEM–energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, Fourier transform
infrared spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy, physical
parameter measurement system, and Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) surface area techniques. Fe3O4 was the
predominant iron oxide present with some Fe2O3. RHIOB and WHIOB rapidly chemisorbed As(III) from water (∼24%
removal in first half an hour reaching up to ∼100% removal
in 24 h) at surface Fe–OH functions forming monodentate ≡Fe–OAs(OH)2 and bidentate (≡Fe–O)2AsOH complexes.
Optimum removal occurred in the pH 7.5–8.5 range for both RHIOB
and WHIOB, but excellent removal occurred from pH 3 to 10. Batch kinetic
studies at various initial adsorbate–adsorbent concentrations,
temperatures, and contact times gave excellent pseudo-second-order
model fits. Equilibrium data were fitted to different sorption isotherm
models. Fits to isotherm models (based on R2 and χ2) on RHIOB and WHIOB followed the order:
Redlich–Peterson > Toth > Sips = Koble–Corrigan
> Langmuir
> Freundlich = Radke–Prausnitz > Temkin and Sips = Koble–Corrigan
> Toth > Redlich–Peterson > Langmuir > Temkin >
Freundlich
= Radke–Prausnitz, respectively. Maximum adsorption capacities, QRHIOB0 = 96 μg/g and QWHIOB0 = 111 μg/g, were obtained. No
As(III) oxidation to As(V) was detected. Arsenic adsorption was endothermic.
Particle diffusion was a rate-determining step at low (≤50
μg/L) concentrations, but film diffusion controls the rate at
≥100–200 μg/L. Binding interactions with RHIOB
and WHIOB were established, and the mechanism was carefully discussed.
RHIOB and WHIOB can successfully be used for As(III) removal in single
and multicomponent systems with no significant decrease in adsorption
capacity in the presence of interfering ions mainly Cl–, HCO3–, NO3–, SO42–, PO43–, K+, Na+, Ca2+. Simultaneous As(III)
desorption and regeneration of RHIOB and WHIOB was successfully achieved.
A very nominal decrease in As(III) removal capacity in four consecutive
cycles demonstrates the reusability of RHIOB and WHIOB. Furthermore,
these sustainable composites had good sorption efficiencies and may
be removed magnetically to avoid slow filtration.

1 Introduction
Arsenic
contamination in groundwater is a global issue.1,2 Arsenic
is introduced into groundwaters naturally,3 while mining4,5 and nonferrous smelting6 constitute anthropogenic sources. Arsenic was
classified as a human carcinogen by the International Agency for Research
on Cancer7 and the National Research Council,
DC, USA.8 The World Health Organization
and Bureau of Indian Standards recommend permissible arsenic concentrations
of 10 and 50 μg/L in drinking waters, respectively.9 Hyperpigmentation, keratosis, skin and internal
cancers, and vascular diseases are some major health impacts of arsenic
in humans.6 In the environment, arsenic
can exist in −3, 0, +3, and +5 oxidation states. Groundwater
arsenic exists primarily as arsenite [As(III)] and arsenate [As(V)]
in the pH range of 6–9.10,11 The predominant As(III)
species include uncharged H3AsO3, while primary
arsenate species include monovalent H2AsO4– and divalent HAsO42–.
As(V) mainly exists in oxic waters, while As(III) predominates in
anoxic waters. As(III) and As(V) also coexist in both types of waters.
As(III) is more toxic and difficult to remove from water versus As(V).11

Adsorption,11 ion exchange,12 membrane filtration,6 and oxidation and reduction13 are available
methods for aqueous arsenic remediation.11 Adsorption is easy to operate and cost-effective, minimizes sludge
production, and makes adsorbent regeneration possible.14,15 Iron-loaded biochar,16 alumina,17 ion-exchange resins,11,18 iron–zirconium binary oxide,19 schwertmannite,20 and biomaterials from
agricultural wastes21,22 have been explored to adsorb
arsenic. Goethite, magnetite, maghemite, and hematite have been used
over different pH ranges for arsenic removal.11,22 Many other adsorbents used for arsenic removal were reviewed.11,23

Biochar was successfully applied for the remediation of heavy
metals,24,25 fluoride,26 pharmaceuticals,27,28 phenols,29,30 and other emerging contaminants31 because of its low cost and local availability.32 Application of iron oxide–biochar composites
for arsenic removal is a relatively new approach.33,34 The biochar provides a porous surface to disperse and hold the iron
oxide adsorbent and increases iron oxide’s surface area.

The adsorption of phosphate,35−37 arsenite,38−40 and arsenate20,40,41 on various iron oxides has been
studied. Akaganéite has a tunnel-like microporous structure
giving a higher surface area per particle size versus goethite (α-FeOOH),
maghemite (γ-Fe2O3), hematite (α-Fe2O3), or magnetite (Fe3O4),
but it is less robust.42 The ability to
adsorb phosphate per unit surface area is similar for these oxides,
so the chemically stable magnetite with its macroscopic magnetic moment
makes it an attractive candidate as an adsorbent if its surface area
can be increased.36 Magnetite nanoparticles
are readily produced from aqueous Fe2+ and Fe3+-containing solution while adding the base. These particles readily
aggregate, so a high surface area carrier such as biochar can be employed
to dispense the particles while providing overall adsorbent particle
sizes that are useful for column flow experiments and facile magnetic
separation.29,43,44

Most methods efficiently remediate arsenite as arsenate due
to
the fact that arsenite [As(III)] predominantly exists as uncharged
H3AsO3 at pH < 9.2. Thus, arsenic removal
is usually carried out by first oxidizing arsenite [As(III)] to arsenate
[As(V)], followed by As(V) removal.45 Several
iron-based adsorbents have shown good arsenic adsorption capacities.
Iron–graphene oxide nanocomposites have been synthesized and
characterized for the successful removal of As(III) from water.46 Similarly, a novel material obtained by coating
activated carbon with zirconium oxide and manganese dioxide47 was utilized for removing As(III). In the presence
of zirconium dioxide, As(III) was oxidized to less toxic As(V) and
adsorbed over manganese oxide nanoparticles through inner-sphere complexation.47 Several metal oxide–biochar composites
were synthesized through biomass pretreatment and were used for treating
arsenic in water. AlCl3-blended biochar, Cu(OH)2-blended biochar, FeSO4-blended biochar, KCl-blended biochar,
and MgCl2-blended biochar composites were synthesized and
utilized for As(III) removal.48

Nanocomposites
offer a plausible solution to the shortcomings of
using pure nanoparticles.49 Application
of nanomaterials exposed on host surfaces takes advantage of both
the hosts and the available impregnated functional nanoparticles.50 Hosts mitigate the release of nanoparticles
into the environment and improve the stability, dispersion, and reusability.50 Very recently, magnetic Fe3O4/Douglas fir biochar composites (MBCs) were prepared with
a 29.2% wt Fe3O4 loading and successfully used
to treat As(III)-contaminated water.51 This
present study has paved the way for advancing water nanotechnology
from labs to larger-scale field/industrial applications, especially
since recycling to remove arsenic was established.

In the present
study, iron oxide–biochar hybrids were synthesized
by copyrolysis at 600 °C for 1 h of FeCl3-impregnated
rice or wheat husks under nitrogen. Rice husk iron oxide biochar (RHIOB)
and wheat husk iron oxide biochar (WHIOB) composites were then sieved
to particle sizes of 0.3–0.5 mm (30–50 mesh size). Then,
these composites were used for As(III) removal. Most previous arsenic
remediation studies were carried out at high As(III or V) concentrations
(>5 mg/L). Some adsorbents capable of remediating arsenic at high
concentrations have failed to work in low concentration range. Thus,
studies here were conducted at low As(III) concentrations (50–1000
μg/L) to demonstrate sorptive As(III) removal at concentrations
usually present in the actual water bodies.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Characterization
Ultimate analysis
was performed to find carbon, hydrogen, sulfur, and nitrogen.23 Percent oxygen was calculated by difference
(Table 1). RHIOB has
a higher percent carbon (38.4 wt %) than WHIOB (36.8 wt %). Both biochars
have large ash contents (RHIOB: 53.5 wt % and WHIOB: 50.5 wt %), which
include Fe (RHIOB: 16.02 wt % and WHIOB: 19.03 wt %) and Si (RHIOB:
27.45 wt % and WHIOB: 12.06 wt %) as the most abundant components.
Qualitative analysis was carried out by inductively coupled plasma
mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) (Tables 1 and S1). The composites
were ashed (6 h at 650 °C) to find the percent iron loading and
other inorganic constituents. Ash was then dissolved in the mixture
of HNO3 and HF (3:1 v/v %). Conc. HCl was added to stabilize
Fe and Al in solution. Digested samples were then analyzed by ICP-MS.
RHIOB and WHIOB hybrid composites contained 16 and 19 wt % Fe loadings,
respectively (Table 1). In contrast, pristine biochars from rice and wheat husk pyrolysis
alone (RHB and WHB) and their respective precursor husk biomasses
(RH and WH) contain very little iron content (Table S1). Other elements (Al, Ca, K, Mg, Mn, Na, and Zn)
were also present in minor quantities. This was also confirmed from
their respective intense peaks in scanning electron microscopy–energy-dispersive
X-ray spectroscopy (SEM–EDX) graphs (Figure 1a–d).

SEM–EDX analyses of
RHIOB and WHIOB before and after arsenic
adsorption were carried out (Figure 1). C, O, Si, Cl, and Fe were the major elements observed
in the SEM–EDX spectra of RHIOB and WHIOB before As(III) adsorption
(Figure 1a,b and Table S1). Na, K, Mg, Ca, Al, Mn, Cu, Rb, Mo,
W, and Pb were also observed before As(III) adsorption. Silicon content
was higher in RHIOB than in WHIOB (Figure 1). Traces of arsenic were also observed in
both RHIOB and WHIOB samples only after arsenic adsorption had occurred,
corresponding to the arsenic observed in capacity measurements (Figure 1).

Adsorbent
ash contents were determined by dry combustion for 6
h at 750 °C. The higher RHIOB ash content versus WHIOB (Table 1) is attributed to
higher RHIOB silica content than that in WHIOB. The H/C ratio is the
degree of carbonization based on the original biomass’s hydrogen
content. Both RHIOB and WHIOB have similar H/C ratios (Table 1), indicating comparable extents
of carbonization. The biochar O/C ratio reflects oxygen from biomass
functional groups that have not yet been lost during carbonization.52,53

SEM micrographs of the RHIOB and WHIOB morphologies for pre-
and
post-As(III) adsorption samples are provided in Figures 2 and 3, respectively.
RHIOB samples at 200× and 500× magnification exhibit conical
arrays of raised surface features lined up in rows, which are characteristic
of original rice husk morphology (Figure 2a,c). Pores at the edges of RHIOB were visible
at 2k× magnifications (Figure 2b,d), which also reflect their original morphological
features. RHIOB exhibited smooth surfaces before As(III) adsorption
(Figure 2a,b), which
have roughened after adsorption. Some partially clogged pores are
seen after As(III) adsorption (Figure 2c,d). Similarly, WHIOB surfaces appear to have adjacent
parallel canals leftover from the wheat husk morphology (Figure 3a). Honeycomb-like
pores with an average diameter of 22 μm were observed at 2k×
magnifications (Figure 3b). At 1k× and 3k× magnifications after As(III) adsorption
(Figure 3c,d), this
surface morphology roughened because of surface deposits formed during
adsorption (Figure 3a,b).

and (b) 2k× before As(III) adsorption and (c) 500× and (d)

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) is a surface-sensitive technique
for identifying elements, their oxidation states, and approximate
surface region abundances. It analyzes ejected electrons while probing
to about 100 Å below the surface, with increasing sensitivity
the closer these elements are to the surface.33 XPS analyses were carried out using X-ray monochromators in combination
with Al Kα radiation (hν = 187.85 eV;
power = 24.6 W; and beam spot size = 100 μm). High-resolution
deconvoluted XPS spectra for Fe, C, O, and As are shown for RHIOB
(Figure 4) and WHIOB
(Figure 5). Deconvolution
was done using Gaussian–Lorentzian sum function in OriginLab
2018(b) software. Comparative wide-scan spectra of pristine rice husk
and wheat husk biochars and their respective iron oxide-loaded RHIOB
and -WHIOB after arsenic adsorption are shown in Figure S1. Pristine rice husk and wheat husk biochars show
no Fe 2p, As 3s, and As 3d peaks. RHIOB and WHIOB, in contrast, displayed
peaks in these regions. This confirms successful loading of iron-(oxides)
and adsorption of As in RHIOB and WHIOB, which otherwise is not present
in their respective pristine biochars. For a more detailed study,
high-resolution deconvoluted scans for Fe, O, C, and As were obtained
for RHIOB and WHIOB after As(III) adsorption.

The iron peak at ∼706.7
eV was assigned to the Fe 2p3 peak. Both RHIOB and WHIOB
displayed peaks at 710.17 and
710.15 eV, respectively, belonging to deposited iron oxide51 (Figures 5 and 6). Fe 2p spectra of RHIOB and
WHIOB were deconvoluted to three components, differentiating peaks
at 710.15 and 723.71 eV, which correspond to Fe 2p3/2 (RHIOB)
and Fe 2p1/2 (WHIOB), respectively. These two peaks correspond
to Fe(III) and Fe(II) iron atoms occurring in Fe3O454−56 and/or FeOOH4,55 (Figures 4a and 5a). The small
satellite peak at 715.5 eV that is due to charge transfer between
Fe(II) and Fe(III) illustrates mixed oxide formation as in Fe2O3 [RHIOB (Figure 4a); WHIOB (Figure 5a)].57

High-resolution O 1s XPS spectra
were obtained for RHIOB and WHIOB
after As(III) adsorption. The O 1s peaks were deconvoluted to three
components. The peaks at 528.91 eV (RHIOB) and 528.73 eV (WHIOB) are
attributed to O2– species. The second peak at 531.7
eV in both RHIOB and WHIOB is assigned to carbonyl oxygens or C=O,
while the third peak from ∼532.0 to 533.7 eV is attributed
to −OH groups (in phenolic hydroxyls and H2O of
the biochar and surface Fe–OH groups of Fe3O4). The binding energies of O2– species shown
in Figure 4b (RHIOB)
and Figure 5b (WHIOB)
correspond to iron-bound oxygen species present in Fe–O (FeOx, Fe3O4, FeOOH).58,59 The O 1s binding energies corresponding to carbonyl oxygen (C=O)
and phenolic hydroxyl oxygens (−OH) result from incomplete
biomass deoxygenation and partial carbonization. They are present
at higher binding energies than at the oxygen binding energies of
the iron oxide oxygens.60,61 The O 1s binding energies
of phenolic hydroxyl groups and other oxygen of biochar cannot be
distinguished from small amounts of adsorbed water.61,62 The iron oxide oxygen peak area in WHIOB is greater than in RHIOB,
which is in agreement with the greater metal oxide (Fe–O) loading
in WHIOB determined in elemental analysis.

The C 1s spectra
were deconvoluted to three components, differentiating
into peaks at 284.3 and 285.15 eV and a broadband from ∼286
to 289 eV in both RHIOB (Figure 4c) and WHIOB (Figure 5c). The peak at 284.3 eV represents C–H and
C–C stretch.55,63,64 The peak at 285.15 eV represents C–OH.63,65,66 The presence of sp2 contributions
is in accord with the formation of partial graphene-like structures.66 This is an expected pattern for biochars.67 The broad flat peak ranging from 286 to 289
eV includes −CO2H, −CO2R, and
carbonates, which occur at the high binding energies above the −C=O
region. This broad peak and the way the deconvolution was performed
make it difficult to determine if a detectable C=O peak exists.

The high-resolution XPS spectra of As 3d in RHIOB (Figure 4d) and WHIOB (Figure 5d) were deconvoluted. A single
component peak appears at 44.1 eV for RHIOB and WHIOB. This proves
that As(III) was adsorbed by both RHIOB and WHIOB, as discussed in Section 2.2 and Schemes 1 and 2.55,56,68,69 The As 3d peak for WHIOB may have a higher binding
energy peak based on the shoulder near 45 eV, but this is hard to
confirm. The absence of clearly deconvoluted components at higher
binding energies makes it difficult to know if As(V) oxidation has
occurred. As(V) is known to appear at higher binding energies in the
species AsO43– (44.9 eV), HAsO42– (45.5 eV), and H2AsO4– (46.7 eV).56 This “regular
peak” for As 3d for WHIOB (Figure 5d) shows a possible shoulder at ∼44.8
eV. This might indicate that a As(V) peak occurs that was not caught
in the deconvolution. Thus, we are unable to demonstrate that oxidation
of As(III) to As(V) had occurred, but in the case of WHIOB, it cannot
be ruled out.

Transmission electron microscopy
(TEM) micrographs of RHIOB and
WHIOB after As(III) adsorption are shown in Figure 6a–f. Magnetite (Fe3O4) nanoparticles are clearly observed for RHIOB (Figure 6a) and WHIOB (Figure 6d). Magnetite primary particle
diameters range from 2 to 20 nm. Some primary Fe3O4 particles appear spherical, while others are hexagonal on
both RHIOB and WHIOB and form loose sheet-like or clustered networks
(Figure 6a,d). Lattice
fringes of 0.291 Å width were captured for Fe3O4 on RHIOB (Figure 6b) that correspond to the 220 plane of Fe3O4.54 The selected area electron
diffraction (SAED) pattern of Fe3O4 on RHIOB
(Figure 6c) showed
fringe widths of 1.52, 2.08, 2.56, and 2.98 Å confirming Fe3O4 crystallinity.70 A
lattice fringe of 0.268 Å was found for Fe3O4 on WHIOB (Figure 6e). The Fe3O4 particles on WHIOB gave a SAED
diffraction pattern, which showed fringes confirming a crystalline
structure (Figure 6f).

X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of RHIOB and WHIOB are
presented
in Figure 7, and their
2θ (degrees), spacing (Å) values, and assignments appear
in Table 2. Changes
due to iron impregnation and 600 °C pyrolysis are observed by
comparing the XRD patterns for the precursor rice husk (RHB) and wheat
husk (WHB) biochars with RHIOB and WHIOB, respectively (Figure 7). The XRD patterns of RHIOB
and WHIOB were also compared to those of Fe2O3 and Fe3O4. RHB and WHB had a broad peak from
2θ from 19 to 29°. RHIOB and WHIOB also contained this
same broad diffraction where the peak maximum was shifted to slightly
higher 2θ values. These represent an amorphous range of interaromatic
plane distances of the partially graphitized biochars. The wide diffraction
peaks at 26.5 and 44.7° correspond to the (002) and (100) planes
of graphite (JCPDS card no. 41-1487).71−73 These peaks correspond
to a combination of carbon in sp2 (26.5°; d spacing 3.35 Å) and sp3 (44.7°; d spacing 2.06 Å) hybridization states.72,73 The C(002) plane represents parallel and azimuthal
orientation of the aromatic lamellae, while C(100)
is indicative of the aromatic lamina size. Greater peak sharpness
indicates a more aromatic lamellae formation and progressive aromatic
ring condensation.73,74 Other XRD peaks common to RHB,
WHB, RHIOB, and WHIOB belonged to the mineral oxides present74 (SiO2, CaCO3, CaO, and
MnO2), often found in biochars. These peaks occurred at
26.7, 38.4, 50.2, 64.9, 68.1, 76.6, and 83.2° and are assigned
specifically to SiO2 (quartz), CaO (lime), CaCO3 (calcite), and MnO2 in Table 2.72,75−77

a The same peaks were seen for both
RHB and WHB.

b The same peaks
were seen for both
RHIOB and WHIOB.

The sharp
peaks in RHIOB and WHIOB, but absent from RHB and WHB,
belonged to iron oxide crystalline phases formed from FeCl3 during pyrolysis, cooling, and exposure to air. The observed peaks
clearly demonstrated that two iron oxide species formed. Diffraction
peaks centered at 35.7° (311), 41.7° (400), 53.4° (422),
57.1° (511), 62.5° (440), 70.9°(620), and 78.9°
(444) all correspond to Fe3O4 (magnetite) peaks
(JCPDS card no. 19-0629).34 Peaks at 24.2°
(012), 25.5° (110), 33.1° (104), 54.4° (116), 64.0°
(300), and 72.3° (119) are attributed to Fe2O3 (maghemite) (JCPDS card no. 84-0310).71,78,79 Two extra peaks observed at 31.8° (210)
and 37.1° (21–2) could possibly belong to small amounts
of FeOOH (goethite) (JCPDS card no. 34-1266).80,81

Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra before and after
As(III)
loading were obtained for both RHIOB and WHIOB (Figure 8). Several sharp peaks observed from 3935
to 3510 cm–1 correspond to O–H stretching
vibrations of absorbed water molecules54,82 (Figure 8). The broad peak
at 3430–3460 cm–1 in RHIOB and WHIOB spectra,
before and after As(III) adsorption, correspond to O–H stretching
modes of surface Fe–OH groups on the magnetite and maghemite
particles83,84 on the surface of rice and wheat husk biochars
(Figure 8). Organic
hydroxyls (especially phenolic hydroxyls) present in biochar would
occur from 3600 to 3400 cm–1. The peak at 2360 cm–1 is due to O=C=O vibration in CO2.82 The broad peak region from
1750 to 1650 cm–1 is due to various saturated and
unsaturated carbonyl functional groups in biochars.25 Distinct peaks at 1115–1057 cm–1 depict both sp3- and sp2-hybridized C–O
vibrations in C–O–C and C–O–H functions.34,83,84 The sharp peak at 669 cm–1 is due to C–C–C angle bending.25 The two sharp peaks at 584 and 456 cm–1 are Fe–O stretching vibrations of iron atoms occupying octahedral
and tetrahedral sites, respectively, in Fe3O483 in good agreement with reported values.30 One key absorbance at 835 cm–1 appeared only after As(III) adsorption [depicted in (red) Figure 8a,c] in both RHIOB
and WHIOB. This is due to the As–O stretching vibration of
As–O–Fe.85

As(III) adsorption, (c) WHIOB after As(III) adsorption, and (d) WHIOB
before As(III) adsorption.

Because magnetic Fe3O4 phases were confirmed
on both adsorbents, saturation magnetization curves were measured
(Figure S2). RHIOB exhibited a magnetic
moment of ∼3 emu/g at 300 K, whereas WHIOB had a magnetic moment
of 8 emu/g at 300 K. However, at 10 K, magnetic moments of 6 and 12
emu/g were observed for RHIOB and WHIOB, respectively (Figure S2). The saturation magnetization values
suggest Fe3O4 crystallinity. This confirms that
iron loading over precursor rice husk and wheat husk biochars resulted
in magnetization because of formation of iron oxide nanoparticles.86,87

The point of zero charge, the pH where the sorbent’s
net
surface charge is zero,88,89 provides information
on ionization of adsorbent surface groups and the interaction with
existing solution’s adsorbate species.88,90 The pHpzc was determined at 25 °C from the ΔpH
versus pHinitial plot (Figure S3). The pHpzc values of RHIOB, ∼5.5, and WHIOB,
∼7.0, were lower than those of RHB, 6.8, and WHB, 8.3, respectively.

2.2 Sorption Studies/pH Dependence
Sorption
studies were conducted at various initial pHs, adsorbent–adsorbate
concentrations, temperatures, and contact times to optimize the As(III)
sorption process. The As(III) speciation (Figure 9) and surface charge experienced by the adsorbate
species are greatly affected by solution pH.82,91 H3AsO3 greatly predominates until pH 8.0 and
constitutes above half of As(III) in solution at pH 9.2 with H2AsO3– the other half. HAsO32– appears as pH exceeds 11 and reaches
a maximum at pH ≈ 12.8. The effect of pH from 2.0 to 10.0 was
investigated for As(III) adsorption on RHIOB, WHIOB, RHB, and WHB
at an initial As(III) concentration of 100 μg/L and an adsorbent
dose of 2.0 g/L (Figure 9). Over this pH range, only H3AsO3 needs to
be considered up to slightly above pH 7.0 and beyond that both H3AsO3 and H2AsO3– could adsorb. High As(III) removal occurred over this entire pH
range with WHIOB (∼97%) and RHIOB (∼85%) (Figure 9) versus modest removal with
WHB (∼20%) and RHB (∼12%) at their highest points (Figure 9). Thus, iron oxide
surfaces adsorb most of As(III) in WHIOB and RHIOB, whereas RHB and
WHB can only uptake As(III) on the biochar and its surface mineral
ash contents. WHIOB removed more As(III) than RHIOB over the entire
pH range (Figure 9),
most likely because of its higher Fe3O4 loading
(23.8 wt % in WHIOB vs 18.2 wt % in RHIOB). The higher WHIOB Fe3O4 loading provides more surface area for adsorption.
The As(III) adsorption efficiency increased as pH rose from 2.0 to
7.0 and then dropped slightly. However, substantial adsorption occurred
over the entire pH range. Equilibrium pH values were also recorded
(shown in Figure S4) and rose for WHIOB,
RHIOB, WHB, and RHB in the pH range from 3.0 to 4.0 (Figure S4). A very small equilibrium pH rise occurred for
WHIOB and RHIOB in the pH range of 4.0–8.0. At high pH (>8.0),
the equilibrium pH values using RHIOB and WHIOB increased to ∼5.0
(Figure S4). Further kinetic and equilibrium
experiments were conducted in the pH range of 6.5–7.5.

g/L; initial As(III) concentration = 100 μg/L; agitation speed
= 100 rpm; temperature = 25 °C; contact time = 24 h) and fractional
composition curves for As(III) speciation.

2.3 As(III) Removal Mechanism
Both adsorbent
surfaces are net positively charged at pH < pHpzc (Figure S3), leading to increased electrostatic
attraction of oxyanion As(III) species to the surface. However, both
RHIOB and WHIOB adsorbents have hybrid surfaces made up of Fe3O4 phases, where most adsorption occurs, and biochar
phases where less adsorption occurs. The local PZC values at the iron
oxide and at the biochar are not measured and do not correspond to
the net measured PZC values. The PZC value of Fe3O4 is independently known to be 7.4. The local pHZPC of the iron oxide surfaces mostly influences As(III) adsorption;
these sites compete for neutral H3AsO3 and H3O+ ions in acidic media4 and H3AsO4, H2AsO3–, and OH– in basic pH. As pH increases,
the amount of both biochar surface and iron oxide protonation drops
and the local net surface charge approaches zero at the iron oxide’s
pHpzc (Figure 9). The greatest total As(III) removal was achieved in the
pH range (6.5–7.5) where the surface Fe–OH groups on
magnetite are not highly protonated or deprotonated. This suggests
that H3AsO3 reacts with Fe–OH to generate
Fe–O–As(OH)2 chemisorbed groups. This process
could be either acid- or base-catalyzed. As H2AsO3– becomes more abundant (pH 8.5 → 10), it
could also react with Fe–OH surface groups, but it would be
electrostatically repelled from the deprotonated Fe–O– surface sites. However, Fe–O– sites do
not repel H2AsO3 even at pH 10.0. As pH continues
to rise, the magnetic surface increasingly deprotonates and becomes
more negatively charged. Also, H2AsO3– and eventually HAsO32– predominate
and experience more surface repulsion. This could account for the
drop in As(III) removal at the higher pH ranges. The neutral As(III)
species, H3AsO3, most likely dominates adsorption
over the highest adsorption capacity range.

Magnetite contains
both Fe(II) and Fe(III) oxidation states. FeIII ions occupy
octahedral sites, whereas FeII occupies both octahedral
and tetrahedral sites.92,93 At lower solution pH(s), the
iron oxide surface Fe–OH groups are protonated to generate
positively charged Fe–+OH2 sites (see Scheme 1).34 Conversely, at high pH, Fe–OH groups are deprotonated
to Fe–O– species.70,82 The pHZPC of magnetite is close to neutral (7.4),82,93 and the maximum uptake of As(III) on both RHIOB and WHIOB was achieved
at ∼pHpzc of magnetite, in agreement with the previous
suggestion of Fe–OH sites reacting with H3AsO3.

Substantial As(III) removal occurs over pH 2 to 10,
so it seems
clear that H3AsO3, H2AsO3–, and HAsO32– (the
latter two at surface Fe–OH sites) can each be adsorbed depending
on pH.4,90,94,95 At pH < pHPZC of iron oxide (∼7.4),
Fe–OH surface groups are increasingly protonated to generate
Fe–+OH2 groups (Figure 9) and can react with the abundant H3AsO3. Oxyanions H2AsO3– and HAsO32– will not be available at
acidic pH values, but some H2AsO3– might be available at pH 8.0 and a small amount of Fe–+OH2 may also exist. If these reacted with a fast
enough rate constant, this reaction might compete. Scheme 1 summarizes possible mechanisms
to monodentate As(III) chemisorbed surface species. H3AsO3 might react with iron at Fe–+OH2 sites by an associative mechanism, followed by loss of water. Alternatively,
loss of water from a surface iron may occur first after protonation,
followed by the attack of H3AsO3 or H2AsO3– at that iron (e.g., a dissociative
mechanism). Both routes are shown in Scheme 1. These processes form a monodentate bond
from As(III) to through an oxygen to magnetite. Monodentate complexes
could proceed further to form bidentate corner-sharing, 2C, and/or edge-sharing, 2E, complexes (Scheme 2), analogous to the behavior
of arsenate tetrahedra, previously confirmed by extended X-ray absorption
fine structure spectroscopy and ab initio calculations.96 In this analogy to As(V), monodentate As(III)
complexes (1V) would be unstable and 2C bidentate
complexes would predominate. The 2C complexes of As(V)
were predicted to be 55 kJ/mol more stable than the “edge-sharing”
bidentate complexes (2E) where arsenic is chelated to a
single iron atom.96 The relative stabilities
of 1V complexes of As(III) versus As(V) are not known,
but the monodentate 1V complexes of As(III) are likely
to either dissociate chemisorbed As(III) back to solution or form
more stable 2C bidentate complexes to adjacent iron surface
sites. Whether associative or dissociative mechanistic pathways are
occurring is unknown, and this distinction may be pH-dependent.

Because biochar surfaces still contain some organic and inorganic
−OH groups (from alkali and alkaline hydroxides resulting from
the ash fraction) after heating 1 h at 600 °C, some As(III) uptake
will occur on the biochar surface. This amount is much lower than
occurs after magnetite has been deposited on the surface (Figure 9). The biochar primarily
serves to disperse Fe3O4 and other iron oxides,
where most As(III) adsorption occurred. Also, biochars from rice and
wheat husks, RHB and WHB, may have chemically different surfaces than
the biochar portions of RHIOB and WHIOB because the pyrolyses that
formed RHB and WHB were not performed with the imbibed FeCl3 in them at 600 °C. Therefore, RHB and WHB surfaces cannot be
used as reliable surface adsorption models for estimating the As(III)
uptake by the biochar portions of RHIOB and WHIOB.

2.4 As(III) Adsorption Kinetics and Modeling
The pseudo-second-order
equation best described As(III) sorption
on RHIOB and WHIOB (Figures S5 and S6; Table 3). Sorption equilibrium
was established in 12 h. The first-order fits were very poor, so these
data are not reported. The experimental linear pseudo-second-order qe values also agreed with the calculated qe values, and the linear pseudo-second-order R2 values were excellent (Table 3). Second-order kinetics is consistent with
rate-determining As(III) chemisorption over magnetite surface sites.82 As(III) uptake at different adsorbent dosages
was higher on WHIOB than on RHIOB (Table 3) because of WHIOB’s higher iron loading
(Table 1). As As(III)
concentrations rise, the time-dependent adsorption efficiencies for
RHIOB and WHIOB also rose.

Adsorption
half-life, t1/2, is the
time when the reactant concentration decreases by half, that is, 50%
of total adsorption.25 The t1/2 values for As(III) adsorption on RHIOB and WHIOB at
different initial adsorbent dosages and concentrations are listed
in Table 3. The As(III)
adsorption half-life values obtained for RHIOB and WHIOB dropped as
adsorbent dosages rose (from 0.5 to 2.0 g/L). Half-life, t1/2, values increased with a rise in As(III) concentrations
(50–200 μg/L) for RHIOB and WHIOB (Table 3).

Bt values were
obtained for each F value from Reichenberg’s
table97 at different concentrations. Bt versus time plots
for RHIOB and WHIOB at different As(III) concentrations were constructed
(Figure S7a,b). RHIOB and WHIOB gave linear
plots at all the concentrations. However, at lower As(III) concentration
(50 μg/L), the linear Bt versus time plot does
not pass through origin. Thus, particle diffusion is the rate-limiting
step. However, at higher concentrations (100 and 200 μg/L),
the Bt versus time lines pass through origin. Therefore,
film diffusion is the rate-limiting step at these As(III) concentrations.
Effective diffusion coefficients were calculated from Bt versus time plots using eq 1. These are summarized in Table 4. Di values of RHIOB and WHIOB
rose as the As(III) concentration increased from 50 to 100 μg/L
and then fell with a further concentration rise from 100 to 200 μg/L.
This drop in Di may result
from a mobility decrease of As(III) ions because of the increase in
retarding force acting on diffusing ions.

2.5 As(III) Adsorption Equilibrium Studies
Sorption isotherm
experiments were conducted at 10, 25, and 40 °C
between pH 6.5 and 7.5 and initial As(III) concentrations varying
from 50 to 1000 μg/L (Figure 10). This concentration range was selected based on arsenic
concentrations reported worldwide in ground and surface waters. Equilibrium
As(III) adsorption amounts on RHIOB and WHIOB increased going from
10 to 45 °C (Table S2). Thus, adsorption
is endothermic. With rising temperature, the adsorptive capacity rose
with increasing adsorbent mobility.34 WHIOB’s
adsorption capacity was higher than RHIOB’s, in accord with
WHIOB’s modestly higher surface area and significantly higher
iron content (Table 1).

Figure 10 Langmuir nonlinear adsorption isotherms of As(III) adsorption by
(a) RHIOB and (b) WHIOB at different temperatures (pH = 7.5; concentration
= 100 μg/L; temp = 25 °C; agitation = 100 rpm; particle
size = 0.3–0.5 mm (30–50 B.S.S. mesh size).

Freundlich,98 Langmuir,99 Temkin,100 Sips or
Langmuir–Freundlich,101 Redlich–Peterson,102 Radke and Prausnitz,103 and
Toth104 isotherms (Supporting Information, eqs S8–S14, respectively) were
used to fit the sorption equilibrium data and to determine the adsorption
behavior, capacity, and parameters used in fixed-bed reactor design.
The Freundlich isotherm98 describes (eq S5) the adsorption equilibrium on heterogeneous
surfaces. The Langmuir isotherm (eq S6)
assumes a uniform sorbent surface sites with identical energies,99 where adsorption occurs as a single surface
adsorbate layer. The Sips isotherm101 is
a combination of the Langmuir and Freundlich isotherms (eq S7). The Redlich–Peterson model (eq S8)102 is a three-parameter
model, describing equilibrium on heterogeneous surfaces and contains
a heterogeneity factor. The Toth isotherm,104 an empirical model, assumes an asymmetric quasi-Gaussian distribution
of site energies (eq S9). This model describes
an improved fit versus Langmuir isotherm model and is often used to
describe heterogeneous systems. The Temkin model is described by eq S10. The three-parameter Radke and Prausnitz
isotherm,103 derived from thermodynamic
considerations (eq S11), is capable of
describing data over a wide concentration range. The Koble–Corrigan
isotherm105 is also a three-parameter model
(eq S12).

Langmuir fittings of As(III)
sorption equilibrium data for WHIOB
and RHIOB are given (Figure 10) with the fittings for the other isotherm models (Figures S8–S14). Parameters and regression
coefficient from all eight of these nonlinear isotherm fittings are
summarized in Table S2. The fits at 25,
35, and 45 °C for all RHIOB and WHIOB adsorption data were ranked
based on their R2 and χ2 values. At 45 °C, the Redlich–Peterson (R2 = 0.9909; χ2 = 0.003) equation fits
the RHIOB equilibrium data best, while the Sips (R2 = 0.9258; χ2 = 0.0053) and Koble–Corrigan
(R2 = 9881; χ2 = 0.0069)
gave equal best fits to WHIOB data. The Redlich–Peterson isotherm
constant β values for RHIOB at 45 °C are very close to
1 (Table S2), reducing As(III) adsorption
to the Langmuir isotherm,106,107 suggesting that RHIOB
has a homogeneous adsorption surface. This agrees with predominant
adsorption on the iron oxide surfaces of the hybrid adsorbent. WHIOB
data give best fits by the Sips and the Koble–Corrigan isotherms,
which combines both Langmuir and Freundlich. Hence, at lower As(III)
concentrations, diffusion dominates, whereas at higher As(III) concentrations,
monomolecular adsorption dominates.24,29

Monolayer
adsorption capacities (Q0) are reported
from the Langmuir adsorption isotherm (Figure 10; Table 5). These maximum adsorption capacities were
13.14 μg/g (10 °C), 94.34 μg/g (25 °C), and
96.14 μg/g (45 °C) for RHIOB and 70.35 μg/g (10 °C),
108.0 μg/g (35 °C), and 110.73 μg/g (45 °C)
for WHIOB (Table 5, Figure 10). These values
are very close to the experimental capacities of 11.63, 91.91, and
94.34 μg/g for RHIOB and 72.46, 97.09, and 103.09 μg/g
for WHIOB, respectively (Table S2). Adsorption
capacities increase with an increase in temperature for both RHIOB
and WHIOB, agreeing with endothermic As(III) adsorption. This As(III)
adsorption increase with a rise in temperature may be due to both
endothermic chemical adsorption and an increase in adsorbent ion mobility.
Both would raise adsorption efficiencies as the temperature rises.34 The Langmuir monolayer adsorption capacities
of RHIOB and WHIOB are comparable to that of many adsorbents (Table 5). High sorption capacities
of many adsorbents are due to the high As(III) concentrations taken
in performing the batch experiments. Some adsorbents capable of remediating
arsenic at high concentrations have failed to work in low concentration
range. Our present studies were purposely conducted at low As(III)
concentrations (50–1000 μg/L) where less data exist and
because many environmental sites have concentrations in this range.
Therefore, these studies may result into low adsorption capacities.
RHIOB and WHIOB successfully remediated As(III) at concentrations
usually present in the actual water bodies (Table 5).

a Studies were carried out at high
arsenic concentrations.

b Studies were carried out at low
arsenic concentrations usually present in water.

c Because almost all As(III) is adsorbed
on the iron oxide particle surfaces, the adsorption capacity based
on the weight of iron oxides deposited on the biochar was calculated
for samples 22 and 23 as 0.83 and 0.82 mg As(III)/g of Fe3O4.

2.6 Multicomponent Sorption Studies
Single
and multicomponent As(III) sorption on RHIOB and WHIOB was examined
in the presence and absence of chloride, nitrate, sulfate, bicarbonate,
phosphate, sodium, potassium, and calcium. All the sorption studies
were carried out at an adsorbent dose of 2.0 g/L for RHIOB and 1.0
g/L for WHIOB at 25 °C and an initial pH of 7.5 (Figure 11). Chloride, nitrate, sodium,
potassium, and calcium when present individually (at 100 and 200 mg/L)
do not affect the As(III) adsorption, while sulfate, bicarbonate,
and phosphate significantly inhibited As(III) adsorption (Figure 11). Furthermore,
the As(III) adsorption decreased more when sulfate, bicarbonate, and
phosphate concentrations increased from 100 to 200 mg/L. Negligible
chloride and nitrate influence on As(III) adsorption may be due to
their tendency to form outer-sphere complexes with iron (oxy)hydroxide
nanoparticles present in RHIOB and WHIOB.50,108,109 Similarly, sulfate and bicarbonates
have been reported to form more stable complexes with iron (oxy)hydroxides,
thereby competing with arsenic oxyanions for adsorption.110 Phosphates showed drastic inhibition in As(III)
adsorption (Figure 11) on RHIOB and WHIOB. This is due to the fact that phosphate belongs
to the same family as that of arsenic and therefore showed close structural
similarities.109 It forms stronger inner-sphere
complexes with iron (oxy)hydroxides, offering strong competition,
electrostatic repulsion, and hindrance for arsenic oxyanion adsorption
on RHIOB and WHIOB.109

Figure 11 As(III) adsorption on
(A) RHIOB and (B) WHIOB in the absence and
presence of individual interfering ions at 100 and 200 mg/L [adsorbent
dose: 2.0 g/L for RHIOB and 1.0 g/L for WHIOB; temp.: 25 °C,
initial pH: 7.5, agitation speed: 100 rpm, contact time: 24 h].

As(III) (100 μg/L) adsorption in the presence
of combined
interfering ions [Cl–/NO3–/SO42–/HCO3–/PO43–/Na+/K+/Ca2+: 100:100:100:100:100:100:100:100 mg/L and Cl–/NO3–/SO42–/HCO3–/PO43–/Na+/K+/Ca2+: 200:200:200:200:200:200:200:200
mg/L) was significantly decreased in RHIOB and WHIOB (Figure 12). The decrease in As(III)
adsorption increased with a rise in individual ion concentration from
100 to 200 mg/L in the multicomponent solution. Furthermore, As(III)
adsorption in the multicomponent system was also studied by taking
all the above-mentioned interfering ions except phosphate. Phosphate
was excluded due to the fact (Figure 12) that it significantly decreased As(III) adsorption
when As(III) and phosphate were taken together in a binary system
[(As(III): 100 μg/L + PO43–: 100
mg/L] and [As(III): 100 μg/L + PO43–: 200 mg/L]. It is clear from Figure 12 that As(III) adsorption on RHIOB and WHIOB
does not significantly decrease when all the interfering ions except
phosphate are present in solution. The slight decrease in As(III)
adsorption in a multicomponent system (except phosphate) is due to
the interference caused by bicarbonate and sulfate ions. Phosphates
do not occur in natural water.111 It can
only be present when water is contaminated with some anthropogenic
source (such as fertilizers). Thus, RHIOB and WHIOB can be successfully
used for As(III) removal in single and multicomponent systems with
no significant decrease in the presence of many interfering ions.

mg/L and Cl–/NO3–/SO42–/HCO3–/Na+/K+/Ca2+: 100:100:100:100:100:100:100:100

= 25 °C; initial pH = 7.5; agitation speed = 100 rpm; contact
time = 24 h].

2.7 Desorption
and Regeneration of Adsorbents
Simultaneous As(III) desorption
and regeneration of the exhausted
adsorbent was performed using 50 mL of a wash solution prepared by
mixing 0.1 N NaOH and 0.1 N NaCl.

First, batch adsorption studies
were carried out at a pH of
7.5 and an initial As(III) concentration of 100 μg/L at 25 °C.
The suspension was filtered, and the exhausted adsorbent was collected.
The adsorbent was washed using double distilled water and oven-dried.
The dried adsorbent was dispersed in 50 mL of the wash solution (0.1 N NaOH
+ 0.1 N NaCl) and kept for 24 h. The suspension was filtered. The
filtrate was analyzed for As(III) concentration desorbed from the
adsorbent. This process was repeated for three consecutive cycles
to find the decrease in recycled adsorbent efficiency. The percent
As(III) adsorption and desorption during four consecutive cycles is
shown in Figure 13. As(III) adsorption on RHIOB decreased from 90% (in the first cycle)
to 86% (in the fourth cycle). Similarly, As(III) removal on WHIOB
was reduced from 92% (in the first cycle) to 90% (in the fourth cycle)
(Figure 13). This
nominal decrease in As(III) removal clearly shows the reusability
of RHIOB and WHIOB for many more cycles.

contact time = 24 h; desorption studies were carried out using 50
mL of wash solution prepared by mixing 0.1 N NaOH + 0.1 N NaCl].

3 Conclusions
Iron
oxide modification of widely available rice husk and wheat
husk biochars was achieved by pyrolysis of the FeCl3-preimpregnated
husks at 600 °C (1 h). These hybrid adsorbents successfully remediated
As(III) from low concentration mostly solutions on the exposed Fe3O4 and Fe2O3 particle surfaces.
Little As(III) adsorption occurred on nonimpregnated RHB or WHB. The
biochars act primarily as iron oxide particle dispensing agents for
arsenic sorption, but the biochar phase can adsorb other organic and
heavy metal pollutants. Fe3O4 and Fe2O3 particles were the major As(III) adsorbers. Reactions
at the Fe–OH surface sites formed Fe–O–As(III)
linkages, chemisorbing As(III). This is analogous to the binding of
arsenate to iron oxide surfaces. No obvious oxidation of As(III) to
As(V) was observed. RHIOB and WHIOB exhibited Langmuir maximum capacities
of Q0 = 96.14 and 110.73 μg/g at
45 °C, respectively, in the pH range of 6.5–7.5 with excellent
adsorption over the pH range of 3.0–10. Uptake rates were fast
and followed pseudo-second-order kinetics. As(III) adsorption on RHIOB
and WHIOB was endothermic. At lower concentrations (50 μg/L),
particle diffusion is the rate-limiting step, whereas at higher concentrations
(100 and 200 μg/L), film diffusion controls the rate. These
low-cost hybrid sorbents have very fast sorption dynamics based on
biochar’s large surface area, which caused the nanosized iron
oxide particles to be well dispersed, exposing a large iron oxide
surface area to the aqueous As(III) solutions. Thus, from low As(III)
concentrations, adsorption capacities were achieved comparable to
other adsorbents used at higher concentrations for As(III) remediation.

This research demonstrated the synthesis of low-cost dispersed
iron oxide nanocomposites. It avoided some negative factors of employing
pure nanoparticles and avoided the low arsenic sorption efficiency
of pure biochar. Instead, both phases were combined to generate hybrid
nanocomposites. Development of biochar-based nano iron oxide dispersed
composites in the present study permitted reasonable liquid flow through
columns and faster filtration together using a low-cost widely available
agricultural waste.

4 Materials, Instrumental Methods,
and Sorption
Study Methods
All the chemicals used were of either analytical
reagent (AR) or
guaranteed reagent (GR) grade. FeCl3·6H2O (>97.0%) was obtained from CDH. An As(III) stock solution (1000
mg/L) was prepared using NaAsO2 (>90.0%, Sigma-Aldrich)
in double distilled water. KI (>99.0%), NaBH4 (>95.0%),
and ascorbic acid C6H8O6 (>99.0%)
were obtained from Merck, India. Solution pHs were maintained using
HNO3 (0.1 N) and NaOH (0.1 N) and measured on a multiparameter
ion meter (model Orion 5 star, Thermo Scientific). Adsorbent–adsorbate
sample agitation was conducted with water bath shakers (model MSW-275,
Macro Scientific India and RC51000, Scientech India) at 10, 25, and
40 °C. As(III) concentrations were analyzed using an atomic absorption
spectrometer (AAS; model Aanalyst 400, PerkinElmer) equipped with
a mercury hydride system and an arsenic electrodeless discharge lamp
at 193.7 nm. Iron oxide–biochar composites were formed in a
controlled atmosphere muffle furnace (model Thermolyne, Thermo Scientific).
All sample filtrations were performed using a Whatman No. 1 filter
paper. Magnetic collection of the adsorbent was also used in adsorption
studies.

The iron oxidation states in iron oxide–biochar
composites
were determined using XPS (model Versa Probe II, PSI, FEI Inc.). The
mineralogy, phase analyses, and crystallinity were identified on a
powder X-ray diffractometer (model X’Pert PRO, PANalytical).
Functional groups in the surface regions were identified using FTIR
(model 7000, Varian). Surface morphology was studied by SEM (model
EVO 40, Zeiss). XPS analyses were carried out using a monochromatic
Al-X-ray source (hν = 187.85 eV; power = 24.6
W; and beam spot size = 100 μm). Elemental distribution in the
surface/near-surface region in the biochar composites was determined
by SEM–EDX (model Epsilon 5, PANalytical). Qualitative analysis
was done using ICP-MS (ELAN-DRC-e). Crystallinity and diffraction
patterns were obtained using a TEM (model JEM 2100F, JEOL) microscope.
Specific surface areas and pore volumes were analyzed by the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) N2 analysis method using a Quantachrome Autosorb
1 Automated Gas Sorption System. The samples were degassed at 150
°C for 5.0 h. CHNS combustion analysis was performed using a
vario MICRO CHNS instrument. Magnetic moments were calculated using
a model T-415 Cryogenic USA system at 5 and 300 K from −5 to
+5 T magnetic field strengths.

4.1 Iron Oxide–Biochar
Composite Synthesis
The iron oxide–biochar composites
were prepared by a proprietary
copyrolysis (Indian Patent Application No. 201811010032)112 of rice husks and wheat husks. Rice husks (∼70
g) and wheat husks (∼130 g) were soaked separately in 2.8 mol/L
solutions of ferric chloride hexahydrate (FeCl3·6H2O) for 24 h. These samples were dried for 2 h at 80 °C
and then slowly pyrolyzed in a muffle furnace by heating to 600 °C
(10 °C/min) and holding for 1 h under N2. The hybrid
iron oxide–biochar composites were washed with distilled water
and then ethanol to remove impurities and soluble metal salts. The
composites were oven-dried and stored in airtight containers until
further use. The iron oxide-rice husk and iron oxide-wheat husk biochar
hybrid composites were designated as RHIOB and WHIOB, respectively.

4.2 Equilibrium and Kinetic Studies
All
sorption experiments were conducted in the batch mode. Adsorption
experiments at pH values from 2.0 to 10.0 were performed with an initial
As(III) solution at 25 °C for 24 h (adsorbent dose = 2.0 g/L;
initial As(III) concentration = 100 μg/L; agitation speed 100
rpm). As(III) adsorption studies were conducted at 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0
g/L RHIOB and WHIOB dosages; 50, 100, and 200 μg/L As(III) concentrations;
and contact times 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 4.0, 6.0, 8.0, 10.0, 24.0, and 48.0
h at 25 °C. Sorption kinetics data were fitted to both pseudo-first-order
(S5) and pseudo-second-order (S6) rate equations.113 Sorption equilibrium studies were conducted at 10, 25,
and 40 °C for 24 h. As(III) concentrations ranged from 50 to
1000 μg/L, and adsorbent dosages were 2.0 and 1.0 g/L for RHIOB
and WHIOB, respectively. All As(III) equilibrium and kinetic studies
were carried out in the optimum pH range of 7.0–7.5 for RHIOB
and 6.0–6.5 for WHIOB. Other sorption study methods employed
here are summarized in the Supporting Information.

Rate-determining step identification during adsorption is
crucial for interpreting sorption/ion-exchange kinetics,114 aiding material selection and conducting system
design.115 Rate depends on external, internal,
or both types of diffusion. Adsorption generally occurs in three steps
including film diffusion, particle diffusion, and exterior surface
diffusion.114 Adsorption on the exterior
surface is rapid and cannot be considered as a rate-determining step.116 Therefore, either film or particle diffusion
is rate-controlling. Kinetic data were analyzed according to Boyd117 and Reichenberg97 to differentiate between particle and film diffusion using eqs 1–4 1  or 2  F is the fractional attainment
of equilibrium at time “t” given by
the following equation. 3  B, the Boyd number, is given
by eq 4 4  Here, Di is the
effective diffusion coefficient within the adsorbent phase, r0 is the radius of the adsorbent particle, and n is an integer defining an infinite series solution.

Isotherm studies were conducted using various nonlinear models
mentioned in the Supporting Information. Fitting of the data was predicted based on the regression coefficient, R2, and Pearson chi-square, χ2, values. Pearson chi-square χ2 is the measurement
of the degree of error between experimental and model predicted values.118 It is given by eq 5 5  where qt and qm (μg
g–1) are total adsorption at time t using experimental
data and predicted model data, respectively. Bt values
were obtained for each F value from Reichenberg’s
table97 at different concentrations.

4.3 Multicomponent Sorption Studies
Interfering
ions including chloride, nitrate, sulfate, bicarbonate, phosphate,
sodium, potassium, and calcium may affect the As(III) adsorption capacity
of RHIOB and WHIOB. Thus, single and multicomponent As(III) sorption
on RHIOB and WHIOB was examined. Multicomponent sorption experiments
were carried out as follows: As(III) stock solution of 100 μg/L
was prepared and used in all the multicomponent sorption experiments.
Then, the corresponding amount of metallic salt [NaCl, KNO3, Na2SO4, NaHCO3, and Ca3(PO4)] was added to 100 mL of the previously prepared
solution of 100 μg/L As(III). Competing ion concentrations of
100 and 200 mg/L were used. Three sets of batch experiments were performed
to determine the As(III) (100 μg/L) adsorption in single and
multicomponent systems. These include (1) the effect of individual
interfering ion (100 mg/L) on As(III) (100 μg/L) adsorption,
(2) the effect of individual interfering ion (200 mg/L) on As(III)
(100 μg/L) adsorption, (3) the effect of combined interfering
ions (Cl–/NO3–/SO42–/HCO3–/PO43–/Na+/K+/Ca2+: 100:100:100:100:100:100:100:100 mg/L) on As(III) (100 μg/L)
adsorption, and (4) the effect of total interfering ions (Cl–/NO3–/SO42–/HCO3–/Na+/K+/Ca2+: 100:100:100:100:100:100:100:100 mg/L). All the sorption
studies were carried out at an adsorbent dose of 2.0 g/L for RHIOB
and 1.0 g/L for WHIOB at 25 °C and an initial pH of 7.5.

4.4 Desorption and Regeneration Studies
Simultaneous As(III)
desorption and exhausted adsorbent regeneration
was performed using 50 mL of a wash solution prepared by mixing 0.1
N NaOH and 0.1 N NaCl.

The adsorbent obtained from sorption
studies was washed using double distilled water and oven-dried. The
dried adsorbent was dispersed in 50 mL of the wash solution (0.1 N
NaOH + 0.1 N NaCl) and kept for 24 h. The suspension was filtered.
The filtrate was analyzed for As(III) concentration desorbed from
the adsorbent. This process was repeated for four consecutive cycles
to find the decrease in the efficiency (if any) of RHIOB and WHIOB.
