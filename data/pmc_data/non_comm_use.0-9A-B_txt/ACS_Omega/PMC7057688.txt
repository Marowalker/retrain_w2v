Graphene
sheets have a vast number of potential applications due
to their excellent properties. However, poor quality and harsh preparation
conditions restrict their application. Here, few-layer graphene (FLG)
sheet powder with high quality has been synthesized from waste expanded
polystyrene (EPS) at low temperature by dense Fe cluster catalysis.
The micron-sized FLG sheets comprising about three layers show high
crystallinity and good electrical conductivity that are comparable
to those of the shear-exfoliated graphene nanoplatelets. More than
70% carbon yield of FLG sheets from cheap EPS and their safe, controllable
synthesis conditions make it easy to expand production. The catalytic
formation mechanism of FLG sheets is studied.

1 Introduction
Graphene,
as a monolayer of carbon atoms organized in a two-dimensional,
atomic-thick honeycomb lattice by sp2-hybridized C–C
bonds, has zero band gap, high carrier concentration (electrons or
holes, 1013 cm–2), high electron mobility
(1.5 × 104 cm2 V–1 s–1), high thermal conductivity, half-integer quantum
Hall effect, low absorbance (about 2.3%), nonlinear optical effects,
high Young’s modulus (1060 GPa), and high breaking strength
(42 N m–1).1 These exceptional
properties give rise to a great number of applications in electronics,
optoelectronics, sensors, thermal management, energy generation and
storage, anticorrosion paints, seawater desalination, and many others,2−6 which require easy production of graphene sheets of high quality.

The production methods of graphene sheets mainly focused on the
liquid-phase exfoliation (LPE) of graphite7−9 and chemical
vapor deposition (CVD).1,10 The LPE of graphite was used
to produce suspensions or slurries of the graphene platelets by overcoming
the van der Waals forces between graphene layers in a solvent by the
energy input.7,8 Nevertheless, a survey of the
commercially available products revealed that less than 10% of the
materials in most of the products consisted of 10 or fewer layers.
None of the products contained over 50% of such graphene.11 Besides the rather poor quality, the harsh separation
procedure of the materials and solvents or additives in the product
limited their applications.9 The CVD technique
as a bottom–up approach was employed to grow a large-area continuous
graphene film in applications of touch panels and displays;12 however, it had limited success due to the extended
defects and void, which jeopardized the structural stability of the
film and damaged its excellent physical properties.1 The CVD growth of multilayer graphene on a metal substrate
was uncontrollable.1 The reduced graphene
oxide (rGO) (around 23% of oxygen content) or GO (usually 45% of oxygen
content) were prepared via oxidation of graphite and subsequent exfoliation
and/or reduction.11−17 However, the rGO and GO were amorphous materials due to the high
density of structural defects and showed poor electrical and thermal
conductivities when compared to those of crystalline graphene.11,17 Furthermore, their manufacturing processes suffered safety hazards
from the oxidizing agents.15,16 Therefore, the development
of a safe, controllable method for the synthesis of micron-sized crystalline
graphene materials with a high content of graphene consisting of 10
or fewer layers is absolutely imperative and remains a challenge.

Expanded polystyrene (EPS) (about 15.4 million tons annually produced
in the world)18 as the most difficultly
biodegradable thermoplastic mostly turned into “white pollution”
due to its one-off usage and a low recycling rate (10–30%),
leading to serious damage to the marine ecology and wastage of resources.19−23 EPS as an aromatic linear polymer material possesses excellent chemical
and thermal stabilities and is a good carbon precursor with 92.4%
carbon content. Our purpose is to turn waste EPS into useful carbon-based
material such as few-layer graphene (FLG).

In this communication,
we have developed a novel, safe, and controllable
method to synthesize micron-sized FLG sheets using waste EPS as a
precursor. Especially, micropores were constructed in waste EPS using
a simple two-step cross-linking strategy, followed by in situ loading
of small-sized catalysts and subsequent carbonization. Compared with
the reported methods, the powder product has a high content of crystalline
FLG sheets and can be obtained at a low temperature of 700 °C
due to the dense Fe cluster catalysis. The yield of over 70% from
waste EPS is beneficial for scaling up the production of FLG sheets,
which provides an effective way for the recycling of waste EPS.

2 Results and Discussion
The high cross-linking of EPS
is necessary to resolve the complete
decomposition of linear PS at high temperatures and obtain a carbon
product. Uniform loading of small-sized transition-metal catalysts
needs to be achieved in a precursor for the low-temperature preparation
of graphitic flake due to its “dissolution–precipitation”
formation mechanism on the surface of transition metal.21,22 Therefore, the preparation process of FLG sheets from waste EPS
is well-designed (Scheme 1 and Figure S1). First, a pre-cross-linking
strategy using glacial acetic acid (HAc) as solvent is adopted to
prepare a low cross-linked EPS to prevent EPS from dissolving in 1,2-dichloroethane
(DCE) and maintain its framework during the subsequent hyper-cross-linking
reaction.23 Afterward, the cross-linking
density of the pre-cross-linked EPS is sharply increased by the hyper-cross-linking
reaction using FeCl3 as a catalyst and DCE as a cross-linker
and solvent, in favor of achieving a high carbon yield.24 Meanwhile, a large number of micropores are
constructed in the interior of the PS framework. FeCl3 is
reduced into FeCl2 and uniformly loaded in the micropores
by evaporation of solvent. Finally, the FLG sheets are synthesized
by carbonizing FeCl2-loaded hyper-cross-linked EPS in a
nitrogen flow.

Scheme 1 Schematic Preparation Procedure of FLG Sheets from
Waste EPS
As shown in Figure 1a,b, a large amount of smooth
graphitic sheets of micron size were
prepared at 900 °C according to Scheme 1. The curved shape indicates that these sheets
are flexible, which agrees with the wrinkled structure observed in
transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images (Figure 1e,f). The high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image
of the white rectangle section of the wrinkled graphitic sheet (Figure 1f) shows that the
dark contrast derives from a thickness of at least 2-fold graphitic
sheet, which contains about 10-layer graphene (Figure 1g). The atomic force microscopy (AFM) image
further proves that the thickness of the graphitic sheet is about
1.2 nm (Figure 2e),
which corresponds with the three-layer graphene belonging to FLG.
The diffraction peaks at 26, 43.9, and 54.5° can be, respectively,
indexed with the (002), (101), and (004) planes of graphite (JCPDS,
03-065-6212) (Figure 1c). The sharp and narrow shape of the (002) diffraction peak and
the emergence of the (004) diffraction peak demonstrate high crystallinity
of the FLG sheets. That is to say, the FLG sheets contain a primarily
long-range ordered sp2-hybridized carbon atoms in the lattice,
which is coincident with the HRTEM characterization (Figure 1g) and the selected area electron
diffraction (SAED) pattern with a typical hexagonal lattice and bright
(002), (101), and (110) diffraction rings (Figure 1h). The high crystallinity is further confirmed
by the Raman spectrum (Figure 2d). The strong G band at about 1580 cm–1 is attributed to the vibration of sp2-hybridized carbon
atoms in a two-dimensional hexagonal lattice of FLG sheets.25 The weak D band at 1350 cm–1, originating from the vibrations of carbon atoms with dangling bonds
in the plane terminations of disordered graphite, is ascribed to the
structural defects and disorders in FLG sheets.26 A low ID/IG value of 0.30 indicates that they are highly ordered
within layers, which is essentially in agreement with the HRTEM and
X-ray diffraction (XRD) results. It is suggested that FLG sheets with
high crystallinity have been successfully prepared.

The XPS spectra of G4-3-9 are shown in Figure 2a,b. The XPS C 1s
core-level spectrum reveals
the characteristic signals of crystalline carbon of FLG sheets with
a carbon content of 96.5 atom % (Figure 2a). Fitting results show that FLG sheets
mainly include sp2-hybridized C–C bonds, which is
confirmed by the C 1s peak at 284.6 eV (Figure 2b).28 Their thermal
stability is investigated by the TG and DSC curves in an air flow
(Figure 2c). The FLG
sheets demonstrate excellent resistance to thermal oxidation with
little mass loss until about 560 °C due to high crystallinity,
which is superior to that of reported graphene oxide,27 and is comparable to graphene nanoplatelets prepared by
ball milling or sonication.28

FLG
sheets were also successfully prepared at lower temperatures
(Figure 3a,b,e,f).
Their high crystallinity is proved by the HRTEM characterizations
(Figure 3c,g), the
SAED pattern with clear diffraction rings (Figure 3d,h), sharp and strong (002) diffraction
peaks (Figure 1c) and
low ID/IG values
(Figure 1d). Although
the XRD patterns indicate similar crystallinity of the FLG sheets
prepared at 700, 800, and 900 °C (Figure 1c), the ID/IG values increase with the rise of temperature
(Figure S2), which should be attributed
to the formation of more dangling bands due to the cracking of the
FLG sheets at higher temperatures (Figure S3). Crystal boundaries (bright lines) existing in large FLG sheets
of G4-3-7 (Figure S3a,b) shrink and crack
with the increase of temperature so that the smaller, isolated FLG
sheets start to form in G4-3-8 (Figure S3c,d). After the temperature rises up to 900 °C, the FLG sheets
mostly demonstrate isolated and more dangling bands from the edge
of FLG sheets (Figure 1a,b).

f) TEM images, (g) HRTEM image of the red rectangle area in (f), and
(h) SAED pattern for G4-3-8 prepared at 800 °C.

The carbonization process of G4-3Fe, i.e., FeCl2-loaded
hyper-cross-linked EPS was monitored by the TG and DSC curves to find
out the formation of the FLG sheets (Figures 2d and S4). The
mass loss of about 15% between 200 and 600 °C should be attributed
to the pyrolysis of the hyper-cross-linked EPS and the reduction of
FeCl2. This is validated by the formation of graphitized
carbon and amorphous carbon due to the coexistence of sharp and broad
diffraction peaks indexed with the (002) plane of graphite shown in
the XRD pattern of G4-3-6 obtained at 600 °C (Figure 1c), which is confirmed by the
2D band and the high ID/IG value of the Raman spectrum (Figure 1d). A rapid mass loss of about 20% with an
obvious endothermic peak between 600 and 700 °C is ascribed to
the sublimation of residual FeCl2. Meanwhile, amorphous
carbon is further catalytically graphitized (Figure 1c,d). A large endothermic peak without a
mass change appears between 700 and 1000 °C, corresponding to
the increase of crystallinity of the FLG sheets. This is testified
by similar XRD results despite the size decrease of the FLG sheets
with the increase of temperature (Figures 1a–c and S3).

The formation mechanism of FLG sheets from EPS was clarified
based
on the well-accepted dissolution–precipitation mechanism of
graphitic flake growth on metallic Fe (Figure 4b–l and Scheme 2). In general, Fe was incorporated into C
to form Fe3C at around 600 °C21,29 and Fe3C was decomposed into α-Fe and carbon atoms,
precipitating as graphitic sheets with the increase of temperature
(above 800 °C).21 The decomposition
temperature of Fe3C usually decreased with the reduction
of the size. As a result, the nanosized Fe3C decomposed
at 600 °C, showing a high graphitization catalytic activity of
the nanosized Fe particles.29 The uniformly
loaded small-sized FeCl2 particles in the micropores of
hyper-cross-linked EPS constructed an arranged array (Figures 4b–g and S4 and Scheme 2a) and were reduced to Fe cluster array below 600 °C
during the carbonization process (Figure 4h–j,l and Scheme 2b). The freshly formed graphene domain on
Fe clusters (about 0.3–1.0 nm deriving from HRTEM image in Scheme 2) had highly active
edges, which absorbed adjacent carbon atoms so that the small graphene
domain grew up with the increase of temperature and growth time.30 The dense Fe cluster array coordinately catalyzed
neighboring graphene domains connected with each other to form continuous
graphene sheets.30 The high crystallinity
of G4-3-6 confirmed the high catalytic activity of Fe cluster array
at 600 °C (Figure 1c,d).29 The 1.2 nm thickness of FLG sheets
composed of about three-layer graphene was ascribed to the small size
of Fe clusters. At a high temperature of 900 °C, the noncrystalline
boundary between the FLG sheets was inclined to crack due to the ordered
arrangement of disordered carbon atoms.

of the Formation Mechanism of FLG Sheets
by Concerted Catalysis of Dense Fe Cluster Array
(a)
FeCl2-loaded hyper-cross-linked
EPS, (b) Fe cluster-loaded FLG sheets, and (c) FLG sheets.

The formation of dense Fe cluster array determines
the production
of FLG sheets. G4-10-9 has a smooth surface of graphene sheets and
a high crystallinity because the high loading of FeCl2 results
in the formation and concerted catalysis of dense Fe cluster array
(Figures S5a,b and S6). On the contrary,
the dense Fe cluster array could not form due to the low loading of
FeCl2 in the precursor so that G4-0.6-9 shows a fragmented
shape, rough surface (Figure S5c,d), and
low crystallinity, which are confirmed by a high ID/IG value and a weak 2D band
(Figure S6).

High cross-linked density
and microporous structure of EPS are
critical to form a dense Fe cluster array and achieve high carbon
yield that contributes to the large-scale synthesis of FLG sheets.
Preparation of highly cross-linked and microporous EPS by hyper-cross-linking
reaction must avoid the dissolution of the EPS in DCE and maintain
a close distance between PS chains. The pre-cross-linking reaction
using HAc as solvent and FDA as cross-linker is an effective solution
strategy (Scheme 3).
The original microcellular and walls of the EPS are maintained despite
a small deformation by the pre-cross-linking reaction of 4 h (Figure 5a). The occurrence
of Friedel–Crafts alkylation is demonstrated by the increase
of the relative intensity of the peak at 2851 cm–1 attributed to the symmetric stretching vibration of −CH2– and the decrease of the relative intensity of the
peaks at 3026 and 3060 cm–1 ascribed to the stretching
vibration of the =C–H on the benzene ring (Figure 5c), compared with
the Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) spectrum of standard
PS.31 The constructed −CH2– cross-linking bridges between the benzene rings support
resistance to dissolution of pre-cross-linked EPS in DCE. After the
hyper-cross-linking reaction for 3 h, disappearance of the characteristic
peaks of the monosubstituted benzene ring between 1667 and 2000 cm–1 indicates that the monosubstituted benzene rings
almost entirely convert into poly-substituted benzene rings (Figure 5c,d),32 i.e., G4-3 has a high cross-linking density,
which agrees with the high carbon yield of over 70% from EPS. The
thickness of the PS wall greatly increases due to the expansion of
spacing between the PS chains caused by swelling, resulting in the
production of a large number of micropores (Figure 5b) in which FeCl2 particles can
be uniformly loaded.24 Anyhow, the obtained
carbon products with or without pre-cross-linking (Figure S7) indicate that pre-cross-linking is vital to obtain
FLG sheets with high crystallinity.

Scheme 3 Schematic Illustration of the Effect of Pre-Cross-Linking on Cross-Linking
Structure of EPS
The high electrical
conductivity of the FLG sheets was investigated
by the open circuit consisting of two pieces of close copper tapes
equipped with a multimeter. Their electrical conductivity is close
to that of shear-exfoliated graphene nanoplates (Figure 6a–d), which is confirmed
by the Nyquist plots of G4-3-9 and shear-exfoliated graphene (Figure 6e,f). This should
be ascribed to the high crystallinity of FLG sheets that is comparable
to that of the shear-exfoliated graphene nanoplates. The capacitance
performance of FLG sheets reflects their structure (Figure 6g–h). The cyclic voltammetry
(CV) curves with a quasi-rectangular shape at different scan rates
even at 200 mV s–1 (Figure 6g) demonstrate a double-layer capacitance
characteristic and a small equivalent series resistance (ESR) with
a rapid ion response, which is affirmed by the Nyquist plot with no
semicircle in the high-frequency region (Figure 6e). Minimum ESR facilitates ion diffusion
into pore channels. The fast transmission of ions is further confirmed
by the chronopotentionmetry (CP) curves with symmetrical triangles
and without distinct voltage drop (IR) related to resistance even
at 5.0 A g–1 (Figure 6h) and is related to large holes from curved shape
of isolated FLG sheets, which exist as powder, which agrees with the
SEM results.

3 Conclusions
We have
successfully developed a novel, safe, and controllable
method to prepare micron-sized FLG sheets with high crystallinity
using waste EPS as a precursor. The products have a high content of
crystalline FLG sheets that can be obtained at a low temperature of
700 °C and are composed of three-layer graphene due to concerted
catalysis of a dense Fe cluster array. Their electrical conductivity
is comparable to that of shear-exfoliated graphene nanoplatelets due
to high crystallinity. The FLG sheets exist as powder, which can extend
their applications. The yield of over 70% from waste EPS is beneficial
to the scale-up of the production of FLG sheets, which provides an
effective way for the recycling of waste EPS.

4 Experimental
Section
4.1 Materials
Chemically pure FeCl3, 1,2-dichloroethane (DCE), and glacial acetic acid (HAc)
were ordered from National Pharmaceutical Group Chemical Reagent Co.,
Ltd., China. Analytically pure formaldehyde dimethylacetal (FDA) was
bought from Shanghai Aladdin Biochemical Technology Co., Ltd., China.

4.2 Preparation of FLG Sheets
The wasted
EPS as a precursor was broken up into small particles, which were
washed by deionized water and dried in an oven at 60 °C. In a
typical synthesis process, 0.3 g of clean EPS particles were blended
with 10 g of FeCl3. The mixture was added into a solution
of HAc (40 mL) and FDA (5.6 mL) at 80 °C for pre-cross-linking
of EPS under vigorous stirring. Four hours later, pre-cross-linked
EPS particles (labeled as G4) were obtained by leaching, washing,
and drying at 60 °C. After that, G4 was swelled in DCE (40 mL)
at 60 °C for 1 h under vigorous stirring, forming a suspension.
The addition of FeCl3 (3 g) into the suspension was regarded
as the starting of a hyper-cross-linking reaction. After reaction
for 16 h, FeCl3 was reduced to FeCl2, which
was loaded in interior micropores of hyper-cross-linked EPS by the
evaporation of DCE at 60 °C. The obtained FeCl2-loaded
hyper-cross-linked EPS was signed as G4-3Fe. Subsequently, G4-3Fe
was heated up to 900 °C at 2 °C min–1 and
held for 2 h in a nitrogen flow in a quartz tubular furnace and the
obtained product was marked as G4-3-9Fe. Finally, the FLG sheets (tagged
as G4-3-9) were prepared after removing the Fe-containing salts in
G4-3-9Fe by 2 M HCl. Besides, G4-3-6, G4-3-7, and G4-3-8 were, respectively,
synthesized by carbonization at 600, 700, and 800 °C to study
the catalytic activity of Fe clusters and the catalytic formation
mechanism of FLG sheets.

To investigate the effect of pre-cross-linking
on the formation of the FLG sheets, the G0-3-9 without pre-cross-linking
and G2-3-8 and G2-3-9 with the pre-cross-linking of 2 h were, respectively,
prepared. In addition, G4-3 was fabricated by removing FeCl2 in G4-3Fe.

4.3 Characterization
The morphology and
structure of graphene sheets were investigated by an FEI Quanta 200
field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) and an FEI TECNAI
G2 F20 transmission electron microscope (TEM). X-ray diffraction (XRD)
spectra were recorded on a Y-2000 X-ray diffractometer with a Cu Kα
radiation (λ = 0.15406 nm, 40 kV, 40 mA). Raman spectra were
obtained on a Renishaw microscope system RM 2000 with laser excitation
of 532 nm, and peak fitting was performed by OriginLab. X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS) was carried out on an AXIS Supra photoelectron
spectrometer, and peak fitting was performed by CasaXPS. Fourier transform
infrared (FT-IR) spectra were tested on a TENSOR 27 FT-IR spectrometer.
The thermal stability of FLG sheets in the air and the carbonization
process of FeCl2-loaded hyper-cross-linked EPS in nitrogen
flow were monitored at a heating rate of 10 °C min–1 using a TGA/DSC 1 synchronous thermal analysis produced by METTLER
TOLEDO. The thickness of FLG sheets was investigated by an FM-Nanoview
1000 atomic force microscope (AFM).

The capacitance performance
of the FLG sheets was evaluated in an aqueous 2.0 M KOH solution on
a CHI 660D electrochemical workstation with a standard three-electrode
system using nickel foam as the working electrode with mass loading
of >1 mg, Hg/HgO electrode as the reference electrode, and Pt foil
as the counter electrode.24 A round sheet
test electrode was fabricated by pressing a stainless steel wire current
collector with a film of 80 wt % G4-3-9 (about 1.1 mg), 10 wt % acetylene
black, and 10 wt % poly(tetrafluoroethylene) (PTFE) mixture. Cyclic
voltammetry (CV) curves were obtained at different scan rates and
voltage range of −0.5–0 V. The chronopotentionmetry
(CP) curves were obtained at various current densities within the
same voltage range.

The electrical conductivity of the FLG sheets
and shear-exfoliated
graphene nanoplates were studied by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy
(EIS) using a glassy carbon electrode (Φ = 5 mm) as the working
electrode. Twenty microliters of the ink from dispersed G4-3-9 (1
mg) or shear-exfoliated graphene nanoplates (1 mg) and naphthol (5
μL) in ethanol (1 mL) was respectively dropped into the working
electrode and dried at room temperature. The Nyquist plots of the
G4-3-9 and shear-exfoliated graphene nanoplates were measured in an
aqueous solution of 2 M KOH within 0.1 Hz to 100 kHz frequency range
at the open-circuit voltage of the AC amplitude of 5 mV at room temperature.
The electrical conductivity of the samples was also investigated by
the designed open circuit consisting of two pieces of copper tape
at a distance of tens of microns on an insulated glass slide and two
electrodes of the multimeter. Five microliters of the as-prepared
2 mg mL–1 suspension of FLG sheets or shear-exfoliated
graphene nanoplates and ethanol was added dropwise to the crack between
close copper tapes and dried at room temperature. The resistance of
the samples was measured after setting the meter to the ohm scale.
