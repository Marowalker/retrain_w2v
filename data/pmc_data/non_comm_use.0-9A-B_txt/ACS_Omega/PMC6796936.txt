The
interaction of cobalt phthalocyanine disodium disulfonate (CoPc)
with calf thymus DNA in solutions was investigated by UV/vis spectrophotometry,
circular dichroism (CD), and hydrodynamic methods (viscosity and flow
birefringence). Two types of CoPc binding to DNA were observed. Fast
CoPc interactions with DNA via external binding to phosphates were
accompanied by the formation of stack-type phthalocyanine structures
on the periphery of the DNA helix. The optical absorption spectra
of such CoPc complexes with DNA were analyzed in order to obtain a
binding constant K = (4.8 ± 0.4) × 104 M–1. CD spectra show the increasing optical
activity of phthalocyanines bonded to DNA. DNA plays the role of a
matrix, contributing to an increase in their stacking interactions.
The CD spectrum of DNA varies slightly. The second type of cobalt-to-DNA
binding manifests itself over a certain time. It can be associated
with the reorganization of ligands in the cobalt coordination sphere
by introducing DNA atoms. In our experiments, such binding was observed
after storage of solutions for approximately 20 h at a temperature
of 4 °C. It was shown that the minor groove of DNA remains free
in CoPc–DNA complexes. CoPc does not bind with the most important
group for metal coordinating to DNA in the major groove (N7 guanine).
We completely excluded the intercalation binding model. The planes
of phthalocyanines in CoPc–DNA complexes are oriented predominantly
normal to the axis of the DNA helix. DNA rigidity (persistent length)
does not change. This follows from the data on the measurement of
the optical anisotropy and intrinsic viscosity of DNA in complexes.

Introduction
Phthalocyanines
and their derivatives have attracted attention
as promising materials for molecular electronics and photonics and
in biomedical applications.1−4 Their interactions with proteins, DNA, and RNA have
been studied intensively.5−8 Phthalocyanine metal complexes are used as fluorescent
labels and effective photosensitizers in photodynamic therapy9−11 because they have an intense absorption in the long-wavelength region,
where the transparency of biological tissues is high enough. The high
sensitivity of the complexes to pH variations (tumor cells develop
in a medium with a low pH) and the ability to generate singlet oxygen
when they are being excited under irradiation can be effectively used
in the treatment of cancer.12 Phthalocyanines
are prone to aggregation in aqueous solutions, which reduces their
photodynamic activity and affinity to biopolymers and makes it difficult
for them to penetrate into the cell.13,14 The attachment
of carboxy, phosphate, sulfo, or ammonium groups reduces their aggregation.
Phthalocyanines can form coordination bonds with metals, and the nature
of the metal largely determines the physicochemical properties of
such compounds. Diamagnetic metals (zinc, silicon, and aluminum) promote
the formation of luminescent complexes, and transition metals (cobalt,
iron, and manganese) provide catalytic properties.

The flat
heterocyclic geometry of phthalocyanines allows them to
intercalate between the DNA nitrogenous bases. This ability is usually
regarded as a sign of antitumor activity of different compounds.5 They also have low toxicity compared with other
coordination metal compounds. In contrast to cationic phthalocyanine
complexes,7,15 the interaction of anionic complexes with
biological objects has been studied significantly less. In this research,
DNA interaction with cobalt disulfophthalocyanine was evaluated. A
model of complexes is proposed, the binding constant was evaluated,
and the conformational changes of DNA in complexes with cobalt compounds
were analyzed.

Results and Discussion
The absorption
of CoPc (the structure of CoPc is shown in Figure 1) in a water solution
partly intersects with the DNA absorption band (Figure 2a).

Figure 1 Structure of [CoPc(NaSO3)2].

Figure 2 Absorption spectra (a) of CoPc (1) and DNA (2)
in 0.005 M NaCl
with Tris-HCl and the dependence of CoPc absorption on C(CoPc) (b)
at 663 nm (1) and 345 nm (2).

From this, it follows that we cannot correctly verify changes in
the spectral properties of DNA upon binding. We can only analyze the
change in CoPc absorption upon binding. Out of DNA absorption (at
a wavelength above 300 nm), the CoPc spectrum includes a Soret or
B band with a maximum at approximately 340 nm and an intense Q band
with a maximum at 663 nm and a weak satellite near 595 nm. Phthalocyanines
are prone to the formation of associates (aggregates) in aqueous solutions.
For such systems, it is expected that dilution will change the shape
of the Q band.16 We did not observe such
changes in the spectrum of CoPc. The linear type of the concentration
dependence of the optical density of CoPc solutions at 663 and 345
nm was observed (Figure 2b). However, we cannot completely exclude the presence of dimers
or other very stable associates even at very low CoPc concentrations.

Preliminary experiments have shown that the absorption spectrum
of CoPc varies noticeably in the presence of DNA.17 The result of spectrophotometric titration with different
DNA concentrations [DNA] and constant [CoPc] = 2.5 × 10–5 M in 0.005 M NaCl is shown in Figure 3. The absorption spectra of CoPc in complexes with
DNA were registered at 1 h after the preparation of the systems and
the next day (about 20 h after preparation). Solutions were stored
in the dark at a temperature of 4 °C. It was shown that at 1
h after preparation of the systems with different [DNA], the B and
Q bands have isosbestic points, indicating one type of CoPc binding
to DNA (Figure 3a,b).

Figure 3 Results
of spectrophotometric titration in 0.005 M NaCl: the Soret
band (a) and the Q band (b), [CoPc] = 2.5 × 10–5 M, [DNA] is shown in the figure; the binding curves for two CoPc
absorption bands at 330 and 663 nm (c) and Wolf–Shimmer plot
(d) with the inset (the inset shows the Scatchard isotherm).

The next day experiment shows the same result for
the Q band, but
the isosbestic point of the B band is not detectable (spectra not
shown). This finding indicates a restructuring of the complex over
a longer time. Indeed, the second type of binding manifests itself
over time, and the equilibrium in the DNA solution for that type of
binding occurs substantially more slowly. It is reasonable to assume
the formation of a new CoPc–DNA linkage (e.g., via the coordination
of cobalt to DNA). In this case, the ligand in the cobalt coordination
sphere should be replaced by an incoming DNA group. Other types of
binding can also be implemented.

The hypochromism and small
blue shift of maximum observed for the
Q band with increasing DNA concentration in CoPc solution is accompanied
by a hyperchromic effect and a more significant blue shift in the
Soret (B) band. The unchanged view of the Q band with the isosbestic
point in time indicates the stability of the first type of complex,
for which the equilibrium is established quickly.

Let us analyze
this type of binding (the isosbestic point is observed
in both bands for the spectra registered at 1 h after preparation
of the systems, and it remains to be observed for the Q band the next
day). This binding affects the electronic structure of phthalocyanines
and indicates that they are in direct contact with DNA. The isosbestic
points and the limit spectrum (spectrum of the completely bound compound)
make it possible to apply the Scatchard procedure to determine the
binding constant. The binding curves were constructed using spectral
changes recorded at 330 and 663 nm for two CoPc absorption bands (Figure 3c). The deviation
of the linear dependence indicates the emergence of cooperative binding
of CoPc to DNA at [CoPc] > 10–5 M from the analysis
of the Soret band and at [CoPc] > 6 × 10–6 M
for the Q band. As we believe, for phthalocyanines associated with
DNA phosphates, cooperativity occurs at lower concentrations and to
a greater degree (dependence for 663 nm) compared to the binding that
affects the B band (the second type of binding appears over time in
the Soret band). At low C [CoPc], both binding curves coincide. For
this area, the apparent binding constant (Kapp) and the number of binding sites of CoPc per DNA base pair (n) were determined. Figure 3d shows two different ways for the binding constant
definition: the method for determining Kapp according to the approach described in the literature18 and the construction of a Scatchard isotherm
(see the inset in Figure 3d). The binding isotherm constructed in Scatchard coordinates19 using formula 1 gives the same values of Kapp and n for two bands: Kapp = (4.2 ± 0.4) × 104 M–1 and n = 1. 1  Here, r is the ratio of the
concentration of the bound ligand to the total available binding sites
on the DNA and n is the number of binding sites on
the DNA (per base pair). [L] is the concentration of free ligands
in the solution. The value n = 1 indicates that CoPc
has only one binding site per base pair, and there are no excluded
binding sites. This result indicates the absence of intercalation.
Note that the Kapp value refers specifically
to monomeric binding (before the occurrence of a cooperative effect).

Another widely used method for determining Kapp is eq 2(18) 2  Here, [DNA] is
the DNA concentration in moles
of base pairs, εa corresponds to the extinction coefficient
of the compound in complexes at the selected wavelength within the
analyzed band, and εb and εf are
the extinction coefficients for free compounds and for compounds fully
bonded to DNA, respectively. The plot of the dependence of [DNA]/|εa – εf| value on [DNA] gives the binding
constant. Such an approach is valid only for a very small degree of
binding. Indeed, eq 2 is a modification of the procedure reported earlier,20 which is valid for r →
0. The equilibrium binding constant Kapp can be determined in this way.21 The
analysis of our spectral data with eq 2 for two spectral bands (for the first type of binding)
gives the graphs shown in Figure 3d. In this case, Kapp =
(4.8 ± 0.4) × 104 M–1 for D at 663 nm and Kapp = (4.0
± 0.4) × 104 M–1 for D at 327 nm. One can see a good agreement in the estimation
of this parameter, carried out in different ways. It should be emphasized
that we considered the absorption bands of the compound outside the
region of DNA absorption. Thus, UV spectrophotometric titration gives
a binding constant value of approximately 104 and the number
of binding sites on DNA n = 1, which absolutely excludes
the intercalation model.

The second type of binding manifests
itself in time and leads to
the disappearance of the isosbestic point in the B band (such spectra
are not shown). For this type of binding, the correct estimation of
binding constant is not possible. There are several ways for CoPc
to interact with DNA: coordination of cobalt to DNA with the replacement
of the ligand in its coordination sphere, another binding, such as
interaction via the hydrogen bonds with atomic groups of DNA, intercalation
or major/minor groove binding, and electrostatic interactions (this
binding requires a certain orientation of CoPc near DNA). We must
remember that DNA has an extremely high negative charge density, which
cannot be completely shielded in 0.005 M NaCl. However, we clearly
see the binding of CoPc to the DNA molecule. It is possible that the
binding provokes a partial replacement of the ligands in the coordination
sphere of cobalt, leading to a change in the total charge of the complex
ion.

The melting of free DNA and DNA in complex with CoPc in
5 mM NaCl
with Tris-HCl was observed. The analysis of hyperchromism in DNA absorption
at 260 nm (maximum of the DNA absorption band) with temperature was
carried out after subtracting the CoPc absorption. All measurements
were carried out 1 day after the preparation of complexes. Figure 4 shows melting curves
normalized to the absorption at 25 °C and their first derivatives.
It was found that no significant changes were observed in the absorption
of free CoPc at 260 nm within the temperature range used (see the
inset in Figure 4a).
According to the experimental data, the DNA melting temperature increased
insignificantly (∼3 °C), which reflects the high stability
of the DNA double helix structure in the complexes. In addition, the
slightly increased optical density at T > 80 °C
for complexes may indicate the existence of CoPc associates on DNA
(absorbing in the same area) that break down when heated. Such small
shifts in DNA melting temperature indicate the absence of intercalation
and provide the evidence of other modes of binding.

Figure 4 Melting curves of DNA
(dependences of DNA absorption at 260 nm
on temperature) (a) and the first derivatives of melting curves (b)
for DNA in complexes with CoPc (1) and for free DNA (2) in 5 mM NaCl
with Tris-HCl. [DNA] = 7.6 × 10–5 M, [CoPc]
= 5 × 10–5 M.

A widely used method for determining the localization of ligands
on DNA in complexes is to study the competition for the binding site
on DNA between the compound under investigation and well-known compounds.
It is known that the 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) dye
interacts with DNA in a minor groove with preferential binding to
A–T pairs. This binding with the binding constant K = (3.0 ± 0.5) × 106 M–1 and
with the number of binding sites z = 0.02 (about
one DAPI molecule per 50 DNA base pairs, z = [DAPI]/[DNA])
causes DAPI luminescence with a maximum at 460 nm (λex = 340 nm). An increase in dye concentration causes its additional
binding to DNA phosphates with a maximum of DAPI luminescence at 540
nm (λex = 420 nm) with a low quantum yield (DAPI
luminescence in the DNA groove has a much higher quantum yield).

In our research, three systems were prepared. First, three pairs
of solutions in 0.005 M NaCl with Tris-HCl were mixed together (DNA
and DAPI, DNA and CoPc, DAPI and CoPc). Second, after 2 h of incubation
at room temperature (21 °C), the third solution (CoPc, DAPI,
or DNA in 0.005 M NaCl with —Tris-HCl) was added. In this way,
three systems with the same DNA, DAPI, and CoPc concentrations were
prepared: (DNA + DAPI) + CoPc, (DNA + CoPc) + DAPI, and (DAPI + CoPc)
+ DNA. We also used (DNA + DAPI) and DAPI solutions with the same
concentrations for comparison. All spectra were registered the next
day after the addition of the last component (solutions were placed
in the dark at a temperature of 4 °C). Because DAPI has two modes
of binding to DNA with luminescence at different wavelengths, as noted
above, we can test both the interaction of CoPc with DNA in the minor
groove and the binding of CoPc to phosphates. It is necessary to emphasize
that DAPI binding with phosphates is observed only at a high DAPI
concentration in DNA solution (the emission has a maximal intensity
at z = 0.3 and λex = 420 nm).22 Because of its much higher quantum yield, DAPI
luminescence in the minor groove can also be observed at z = 0.3 at the excitation wavelength of 340 nm. In our experiment,
we used λex = 380 nm because of the strong absorption
of CoPc at 340 nm (see Figure 2). The luminescence of DAPI can be quenched when there is
another compound that can displace the bound dye. We checked the competition
between CoPc and DAPI for binding sites on DNA at z = 0.02 (DAPI luminescence is typical for groove binding) and z = 0.3 (we can observe DAPI luminescence for groove and
phosphate modes).

In general, the presence of CoPc in a solution
does not prevent
DAPI location in a minor groove of DNA regardless of the order of
CoPc addition to the solution (see shortwave peaks 1–4 in Figure 5a,b). The only peak
is noticeably different from the other spectra (Figure 5a, spectrum 3), but over time, this spectrum
becomes indistinguishable from the others. This spectrum is related
to a DAPI solution with CoPc just after the addition of DNA. We can
assume that CoPc can interact with DAPI and prevents further binding
of DAPI to DNA with the location in a minor groove. Nevertheless,
later, such complexes are fully formed (Figure 5b, spectrum 3).

Figure 5 Influence of CoPc on
DAPI luminescence in complexes with DNA immediately
after the preparation of solutions (a) and after 2 days (b). (1–4) z = 0.02, λex = 380 nm; (5–8)—z = 0.3, λex = 420 nm; (1, 5)—(DAPI
+ DNA) without CoPc; (2, 6)—(DNA + CoPc) + DAPI for the addition
of DAPI to CoPc–DNA complexes; (4, 8)—(DNA + DAPI) +
CoPc for the addition of CoPc to DNA–DAPI complexes; (3, 7)—(DAPI
+ CoPc) + DNA for the addition of DNA to DAPI solution with CoPc.
[DNA] = 1.5 × 10–5 M, [CoPc] = 5 × 10–6 M, [DAPI] = 3 × 10−7 M (for z = 0.02), [DAPI] = 5 × 10−6 M (for z = 0.3), pH 7. Note that the real intensity for the spectra
(5–8) is 6 times greater than that shown in the figure.

The external binding of DAPI to phosphate groups
can be characterized
with long-wave peaks as shown in Figure 5. It is clear that the presence of CoPc in
solutions partially prevents the binding of DAPI to DNA phosphates.
Naturally, when CoPc is added to an already formed DAPI–DNA
complex, such an effect is manifested only with time (compare spectrum
8 in Figure 5a,b).

This result supports the existence of such type of CoPc binding
to DNA that requires a significantly long time. Overall, this experiment
confirmed an interaction between CoPc and negatively charged DNA,
which causes a change in the absorption spectrum of CoPc and weakly
increases the DNA melting temperature. We emphasize that the minor
groove of DNA remains accessible for DAPI after the formation of CoPc–DNA
complexes.

To clarify the possibility of CoPc location in the
major groove
during binding, we used compounds that form complexes with N7 guanine
(N7G): cis-DDP (cisplatin) and Mn2+ ions
(Figure 6).

Figure 6 Adsorption
spectra: Soret (a,c), Q (b,d) bands and DNA absorption
region (e) for CoPc–DNA complexes formed after and before the
binding of compounds located in the DNA major groove: Mn2+ (a,b) and cis-DDP (c–e). Spectrum 8 in e
demonstrates the sum of spectrum 1 and spectrum 6. The order of the
addition of components is shown near the lines.

The binding of positively charged ligands to N7G causes specific
changes in the DNA absorption: slight hypochromism that at high concentrations
turns into hyperchromism at 260 nm and an emergence of a shoulder
at λ > 270 nm.23−25 The experimental data indicate
competition for the
binding sites on DNA between CoPc and Mn2+ (Figure 6a,b).

Note that manganese
ions are associated not only with DNA bases
but also with phosphates. Therefore, this competition can manifest
itself precisely because of the CoPc binding to DNA phosphates. Indeed,
coordination of platinum to N7G does not prevent the binding of CoPc
to DNA (Figure 6c,d).
The coincidence of spectra 2, 3, and 4 in Figure 6e for different orders of addition of components
in the region of DNA absorption suggests that CoPc does not bind to
N7G in the major groove of DNA. N7 guanine is the most important group
for metal coordinating to DNA. The spectra also indicate the absence
of a CoPc interaction with Mn2+ and cis-DDP in our experiment.

It was also shown that CoPc in complexes
with DNA has only a minor
influence on the DNA CD spectrum (Figure 7a). A small decrease in the amplitude of
the bands is observed, for example, for DNA complexes with positive
ions that bind to phosphate groups.26,27 Thus, it is
unlikely that cobalt binds with nitrogen bases.

Figure 7 CD spectra of DNA in
solutions with different CoPc concentrations
(a) and CD spectra of CoPc without and with DNA in 0.005 M NaCl (b).
Concentrations of components are shown near the curves.

Phthalocyanine compounds have optical activity.28 Indeed, CoPc has its own CD spectrum in the
Q band region
with zero near 663 nm at the maximum of CoPc absorption (Figure 7b). The addition
of DNA causes more intensive CD spectra and a blue shift (zero shifts
of the wavelength corresponding to the maximum of CoPc absorption
in complexes with DNA).

The results of hydrodynamic experiments
provide information on
the state of the tertiary structure of DNA in a solution. Figure 8 shows the intrinsic
viscosity determination result with and without CoPc in a solution
(the measurements were carried out 1 day after the preparation of
the systems). Nonetheless, only the intrinsic viscosity of DNA can
clear up the question of the possibility of intercalation of the phthalocyanine
ligands. Indeed, the relative, specific, and reduced viscosities of
DNA solutions depend on the DNA concentration, and because of intermolecular
interactions, they cannot precisely indicate the change in the size
of the macromolecule. This is especially true for solutions containing
compounds that are prone to association. Certainly, the intrinsic
viscosity of DNA gives correct information about the main macromolecular
parameters (coil volume, hydrodynamic length, and chain rigidity according
to eq 4). The determination
of the intrinsic viscosity of DNA (eq 3) requires the correct dilution with preservation of
the equilibrium between bound and free CoPc in DNA solution (in other
words, the volume of the macromolecule should not change during dilution).
For that reason, we used a binding constant, as described in the literature.29 It was shown that the presence of CoPc in the
concentrations used (measurements were carried out for r = 0.36 when filling the binding sites on DNA) does not affect the
intrinsic viscosity (Figure 8), that is, the DNA molecular parameters, which excludes the
intercalation mode of binding for CoPc–DNA complexes.

Figure 8 Results of
viscometric experiments: dependence of the reduced viscosity
of DNA solutions in 0.005 M NaCl on DNA concentration at r = 0 (1) and r = 0.36 (2) for determining the DNA
intrinsic viscosity by extrapolation of dependences to C([DNA)] =
0.

The combination of spectral and
viscometric experimental data shows
that intercalation is not observed when CoPc interacts with DNA. Fluorescence
of DAPI in solutions with CoPc–DNA complexes shows that the
minor groove of DNA is free and available for the dye binding. The
major groove is also not occupied by CoPc. External binding with phosphates
can be accompanied by the stacking of phthalocyanine ligands. This
assumption was confirmed when measuring the optical anisotropy of
DNA in the complexes. Figure 9 shows the dependence of the relative change in the optical
anisotropy of the DNA statistical segment (Kuhn segment) on the concentration
of CoPc in solutions (measured 1 day after preparation of the systems).
This parameter was determined in an experiment according to eqs 5 and 6.

Figure 9 Dependence of relative changes in optical anisotropy of the DNA
statistical segment on [CoPc] in 0.005 M NaCl. C (DNA) = 0.007%.

It is known that the optical anisotropy of a statistical
segment
(α1 – α2) is determined as
a product of the number of monomeric units in a Kuhn segment S (DNA
base pairs) and the average optical anisotropy of a monomeric unit
(base pair for DNA) Δβ. The first value (S) characterizes DNA rigidity (like DNA persistent length in a wormlike
model), while the second parameter Δβ depends on the orientation
of the base pair regarding the DNA helix. For DNA in B-form, Δβ
has a maximum value. Thus, any change in the secondary structure of
DNA can only lead to a decrease in the Δβ value. Because
the viscometric data show that DNA rigidity does not change upon binding,
it remains to be assumed that the experimentally detectable increase
in optical anisotropy may be caused by the contribution of bound phthalocyanine
ligands to the measured optical anisotropy of the DNA statistical
segment. For that, a certain mutual orientation of phthalocyanines
(in a stacked state) and their general orientation mainly parallel
to the plane of DNA bases are necessary. These data confirm the assumption
of the external binding of CoPc to DNA with the formation of stacked
phthalocyanines outside the helix.

Conclusions
Our
research shows that in 0.005 M NaCl, CoPc interacts with DNA.
CoPc binding causes a blue shift with a hypochromic effect in the
Q band and hyperchromism with a similar shortwave shift in the B band.
These data indicate that phthalocyanines have direct contact with
DNA. Two types of CoPc binding to DNA achieving fast and slow equilibrium
were observed. First, CoPc interacts with DNA via external binding
with DNA phosphates with the binding constant K=
(4.8 ± 0.4) × 104 M–1. In such
complexes, phthalocyanine associates form stack-type structures around
the periphery of the DNA helix. Second, cobalt-to-DNA binding manifests
itself over time (the isosbestic point in the Soret band disappears
and the DAPI luminescence also indicates the slow binding of CoPc
to DNA). The binding can be accompanied by the reorganization of ligands
in the cobalt coordination sphere over a certain time via the entry
of DNA atoms. CD and UV–vis spectra as well as hydrodynamic
methods show that the second type of binding does not affect the first
complexes (CoPc binding with DNA phosphates). The minor DNA groove
remains available for the penetration of other molecules after the
formation of CoPc–DNA complexes. All data clearly indicate
the absence of an intercalation. The viscometry and optical anisotropy
of DNA in the complexes point to the invariance of DNA rigidity (DNA
persistent length) when binding. The flow birefringence method also
indicates that the orientation of phthalocyanine ligands in complexes
is predominantly parallel to the plane of the base pairs.

Materials and
Methods
Sodium salt of high-molecular-weight calf thymus
DNA (Sigma-Aldrich)
with molecular mass M = 6 × 106 (determined
from DNA intrinsic viscosity in 0.15 M NaCl) was used.30 DNA was dissolved in distilled water (10 mg
in 100 mL). After storage for 5 days at a temperature of 4 °C
and adding an NaCl solution of a given concentration, the resulting
stock solution was filtered. DNA concentration in the stock solution
was determined from the difference in absorption ΔD at 270 and 290 nm for hydrolyzed DNA in 0.005 M NaCl after 15 min
boiling with 6% HClO4 at 100 °C.31 C(DNA) = [DNA] = 50 × ΔD (in
g/dL or %). This method of determining the DNA concentration makes
it possible to control the DNA double-stranded structure during the
experiment by using the value of the molar extinction coefficient: E260(P) = 31.1 × D260/[DNA]. In this experiment, we have used DNA with an E260(P) value less than 6800 M–1·cm–1. Cobalt (II) phthalocyanine disodium
disulfonate [CoPc(NaSO3)2] (we will denote it
further as CoPc) was purchased from the Dmitrievsky chemical plant
(Russia). A stock solution of CoPc in purified water type I also contained
Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7) and 5 mM NaCl. To prevent CoPc aggregation
in solution, we used a concentration not exceeding 10–4 M. CoPc complexes with DNA were prepared by mixing equal volumes
of their solutions in 0.005 M NaCl with Tris-HCl buffer.

Absorption
spectra were registered with Specord 200 Plus (Analytic
Jena). The luminescence of DAPI (4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole)
as a competing dye was registered with a Hitachi 850 spectrofluorimeter
(Japan). Luminescence excitation and emission spectra were corrected
for the spectral instrument sensitivity. Circular dichroism (CD) spectra
were obtained with an autodichrograph Mark V (Jobin Yvon, France).
Measurements were performed in a quartz cell with an optic path length
of 1.0 cm. Spectra were recorded three times with subsequent averaging.
Initial processing of the obtained spectra was performed using the
software supplied with the instrument. CD spectra are shown as the
difference in absorbance between left- and right-polarized beams ΔA = AL – AR or in the corresponding extinction coefficients Δε
= εL – εR. Smoothing of the
spectra was performed by the Savitsky–Golay method32 with a 15-point smoothing frame. For DNA melting
experiments, two systems were prepared: a DNA solution in 0.005 M
NaCl with and without CoPc. Tris-HCl buffer was used. Melting curves
were obtained with Specord 200 Plus.

To control the tertiary
structure of the DNA molecule during the
formation of complexes with CoPc, we used hydrodynamic methods. To
describe the behavior of high molecular DNA in a solution, one can
use either the model of a freely joined chain or the model of the
wormlike (persistence) chain. The universal conformational parameters
of the macromolecules for these models are the mean-square distance
between the ends of the chain (h̅2)1/2, the contour (hydrodynamic) length L, and the molecular mass M. The length of the statistical segment
(Kuhn segment) A and the persistent length p for the wormlike chain describe the bending (equilibrium)
rigidity of the macromolecule.

In our experiment, a relative
viscosity ηr of
DNA solutions in 0.005 M NaCl with and without CoPc was determined
at 21 °C with a low gradient Zimm–Crothers-type rotation
viscometer.33 The velocity gradients did
not exceed 1 s–1. The intrinsic viscosity of DNA
was obtained because of the extrapolation of the dependence of reduced
viscosity (ηr – 1)/C on DNA
concentration to C = 0 3  Here, C is the concentration
of the polymer (in our research, we denote DNA concentration as [DNA]).
For DNA in complexes with CoPc, the dilution was carried out taking
into account the binding constant value.29 The main DNA parameters can be determined from the equation 4  where Φ is the Flory parameter, M is the DNA molecular mass, (h̅2)1/2 and (h̅02)1/2 are the mean-square distances between
the ends of the DNA chain in the real and in the ideal solutions,
respectively, α is the coefficient of linear swelling, α
= (h̅2)1/2/(h̅02)1/2, L is the
hydrodynamic length of the polymer chain, and A is
the length of the Kuhn segment (chain rigidity parameter). For high
molecular DNA samples, A = 2p.

The optical
anisotropy of DNA was determined with the flow birefringence
method. The difference in the polarizabilities of DNA statistical
segments (α1 – α2) along
(α1) and normal (α2) to the DNA
helix axis was determined from the equation (for a negligible form
effect) 5  Here, Δn is the measured
birefringence value of DNA solution in the field of the flow gradient g, η and η0 are the viscosities of
the solution and solvent, ns is the refractive
index of the solvent, k is the Boltzmann constant,
and T is the absolute temperature. The (α1 – α2) value is proportional to the
DNA base pair optical anisotropy Δβ (difference in its
polarizabilities along (β1) and normal (β2) to the DNA helix axis) and to the number of base pairs S
in the DNA statistical segment 6  

The S value
also determines the DNA rigidity:
S = A/l (l is the
length of the base pair along the DNA helix). All measurements were
carried out at 21 °C.
