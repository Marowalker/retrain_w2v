In
computational drug discovery, ranking a series of compound analogues
in the order that is consistent with the experimental binding affinities
remains a challenge. Many of the computational methods available for
evaluating binding affinities have adopted molecular mechanics (MM)-based
force fields, although they cannot completely describe protein–ligand
interactions. By contrast, quantum mechanics (QM) calculations play
an important role in understanding the protein–ligand interactions;
however, their huge computational costs hinder their application in
drug discovery. In this study, we have evaluated the ability to rank
the binding affinities of tankyrase 2 ligands by combining both MM
and QM calculations. Our computational approach uses the protein–ligand
binding energies obtained from a cost-effective multilayer fragment
molecular orbital (MFMO) method combined with the solvation energy
obtained from the MM-Poisson–Boltzmann/surface area (MM-PB/SA)
method to predict the binding affinity. This approach enabled us to
rank tankyrase 2 inhibitor analogues, outperforming several MM-based
methods, including rescoring by molecular docking and the MM-PB/SA
method alone. Our results show that this computational approach using
the MFMO method is a promising tool for predicting the rank order
of the binding affinities of inhibitor analogues.

Introduction
Computational approaches
in structure-based drug design have become
increasingly important for rational drug discovery. For these computational
approaches, even if the structure of a protein–ligand complex
can be accurately predicted based on X-ray crystallography data, accurate
ranking of protein–ligand binding affinities using this approach
is still a major challenge.

Various structure-based computational
methodologies exist for the
prediction or ranking of protein–ligand binding affinities.
Molecular docking, which is one of the simplest methods, is a powerful
tool often used for compound screening. This method uses an approximate
scoring function to compute a docking score corresponding to the binding
affinity. It is well-known that this method can be useful for discriminating
active compounds from inactive ones, however, the ability to rank
protein–ligand binding affinities is not sufficiently reliable
for drug design. In addition to molecular docking, more accurate computational
techniques using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are available
for estimating the binding free energy. These techniques include thermodynamic
integration,1 free energy perturbation,1 linear interaction energy,2 and molecular mechanics-Poisson–Boltzmann and surface
area (MM-PB/SA)3 methods. Most of these
methods use classical molecular mechanics (MM) force fields. Although
MM force fields have the advantage of fast energy calculations that
allow efficient conformation samplings, the accuracy of the MM force
field for protein and ligand molecules strongly affects the estimate
of protein–ligand binding affinity. Protein–ligand systems
have a variety of nonbonded interactions, such as π-stacking,
charge transfer, polarization effects, and dispersion effects as well
as the usual and weak hydrogen bonds, as evidenced by structural studies.4 These nonbonding interactions cannot be understood
with sufficient accuracy using classical MM force fields.

By
contrast, the application of first-principles (or ab initio)
quantum mechanics (QM) calculations, which take into consideration
such nonbonding interactions, can significantly improve the accuracy
of calculations made using the MM force fields. Therefore, QM methods
play an important role in understanding protein–ligand interactions.
Although there has been great interest in the use of QM methods in
the field of drug discovery, the huge computational costs hinder their
practical use. A combined QM and MM approach,5−7 such as the
QM/MM8 and ONIOM9 methods, is one of the cost-effective QM methods available for computation
in biomolecular systems. In the QM/MM and ONIOM methods, a region
of special interest (e.g., the active site region) is included in
the QM region, and the rest of the system is treated at the MM level.
The application of these methods alleviates several issues in the
classical description of biomolecular interactions and enables their
more accurate description at a relatively moderate computational cost.5−7 Another cost-effective QM method for treating biomolecular systems
is the fragment molecular orbital (FMO) method.10−14 In this method, the electronic states of large biomolecular
systems, such as proteins or DNA, can be computed through a fragment-based
strategy. The biomolecular system is divided into fragments, and then
the QM calculations are applied to the individual fragments. We have
previously evaluated an efficient acceleration scheme15 for understanding protein–ligand interactions using
a multilayer fragment molecular orbital (MFMO) method.16 The computational approach using the MFMO method
can reduce the computational costs compared with the conventional
FMO method, while maintaining accuracy. On the basis of these previous
studies,15,16 we concluded that the MFMO method can be
utilized to predict the binding affinity for protein–ligands.

In this study, we used the binding energy for an energy-minimized
structure of protein–ligand complex obtained from the MFMO
method for the prediction of rank-ordering of protein–ligand
binding affinity. Furthermore, to obtain more accurate protein–ligand
affinity, the effects of solvation, entropy, and conformational samplings
need to be considered. The scoring function used for the prediction
of protein–ligand binding affinity was based on the MM-PB/SA
method, and the solvation energy of a single energy-minimized structure
was evaluated using the MM-PB/SA method, which has been reported in
previous studies to be a reasonable approach.17−19 For the entropic
effect of protein–ligand association, the change in entropy
of the protein and the ligand largely contributes to the binding affinity.
In our scoring function, the conformational entropic change of the
ligand only was estimated using the number of single rotatable bonds
in the ligand. This simple estimation for ligand conformational entropy
has been reported in several previous studies.20−22 In our computational
approach, the effect of conformational sampling was not considered.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of the practical
application of the MFMO method for rational structure-based drug design.

Our computational approach was applied to evaluate the binding
affinities of 23 inhibitor analogues of tankyrase 2 (see Figures S1
and S2 in the Supporting Information).23 Tankyrase belongs to the family of poly(ADP-ribose)
polymerases (PARPs) and modifies its substrate protein through poly-ADP-ribosylation
(PARsylation) using nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide as a substrate.24 The two isoforms of tankyrase (tankyrase 1 and
tankyrase 2) share overlapping functions and similar structures, including
the ankyrin repeat domain, the sterile alpha molecule domain, and
the PARP catalytic domain.24 They are involved
in a multitude of cellular functions,25−31 including telomere homeostasis, mitotic spindle formation, vesicle
transport linked to glucose metabolism, Wnt/β-catenin signaling,
and viral replication. In particular, it has been shown that tankyrase
proteins regulate the activity of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway
in colon cancer cells through PARsylation and destabilization of the
axin protein.32 Because deregulation of
this pathway has been identified in many cancers, tankyrase proteins
have become attractive drug targets. Several recent studies23,33−36 have identified small-molecule inhibitors of tankyrase proteins
that are responsible for the stabilization of axin followed by increased
degradation of β-catenin. Here, we evaluated the ranking of
the binding affinities of tankyrase 2 inhibitors that had been identified
by Shultz et al. because their results revealed a substantial structure–activity
relationship23 (Figures S1 and S2 in the Supporting Information). Because the structures
of these inhibitor analogues are all similar, it is presumed from
the X-ray crystallographic information33,35 that the inhibitor
analogues used in this study are accommodated in the nicotinamide
binding pocket, forming hydrogen bonds with Gly1032 and Ser1068 of
the tankyrase 2 protein (see Figure 1).

pocket.
The left-hand figure shows the structure of the tankyrase 2-inhibitor
(C01) complex (PDB entry: 3KR8). The molecular surface representation shows the nicotinamide
binding pocket that accommodates the inhibitor. Here, the inhibitor
is shown by a ball and stick model. The hydrophobic and hydrophilic
regions in the binding pocket are drawn in blue and red, respectively.
The amino acid residues constituting the binding pocket are shown
by stick models. Among these amino acid residues, aromatic amino acid
residues are drawn in purple. The right-hand figure shows the inside
of the binding pocket of the left-hand figure. Gly1032 and Ser1068
in the tankyrase 2 protein form hydrogen bonds with the inhibitor.
It is expected that Gly1032 and Ser1068 would form similar hydrogen
bonds with other inhibitors.

Results
Rank-Ordering of Class A Ligands
In this study, we
classified all ligands into two classes, A and B, according to the
structural characteristics of the ligands (see Materials
and Methods section for the details and Figure 2). First, we evaluated the prediction of
rank-ordering using our computational approach for the protein–ligand
binding affinities of class A ligands. To assess how accurately our
computed affinities described the experimentally measured binding
affinities, we analyzed the correlation between our calculated affinities
and the experimental affinities (Figure 3). From Figure 3, it is clear that there was a relatively
high correlation between the binding affinities calculated using our
scoring function and the experimental binding affinities [correlation
coefficient (R) > 0.856 and predictive index (PI)
> 0.861]. Values were obtained with or without the weighting factor
α for the entropic term (see Materials and
Methods section), although structural sampling was not performed.
However, it should be noted that the absolute values of the calculated
binding affinities were largely overestimated compared to the experimental
values. In addition, from Figure S3 in the Supporting Information, it can be seen that the binding affinity obtained
using the MFMO method was as good as that obtained using the conventional
FMO method, as has been reported in our previous paper.16 Here, we also focused on the weighting factor
α for the entropic term in the scoring function. As seen in Figure 3, on comparing the
values obtained when α = 1 and α = 0, it was observed
that the introduction of the entropic term using single rotatable
bonds tends to reduce the R and PI values between
our predicted affinities and the experimental affinities for class
A ligands. This suggests that inclusion of the entropic term describing
single rotatable bonds in the ligand does not make a suitable contribution
toward predicting tankyrase 2–ligand binding affinities.

Figure 2 Structural
feature of a tankyrase 2 inhibitor. The ligands used
in this study have common structural features. The common structural
feature is that each ligand consists of three parts, that is, a core,
a linker, and a ring. Among these three parts, the linker and the
ring affect the conformational flexibility of each ligand. Gly1032
and Ser1068 in the tankyrase 2 protein form hydrogen bonds with the
core and linker regions of each ligand. Here, we show the interaction
with an inhibitor (C04) as an example.

Figure 3 Correlation between the experimental binding affinities and the
calculated binding affinities using our scoring function for class
A ligands. The abscissa and ordinate indicate the experimental and
calculated binding affinities, respectively. The calculated binding
affinities with a weighting factor of α = 1 (left-hand figure)
and those with a weighting factor of α = 0 (right-hand figure)
are shown.

As mentioned above (see Figure 3), our scoring function
using the MFMO method showed
a high ability to rank ligands. This increased ranking ability was
due to factors, namely, geometry refinement by the ONIOM-based QM
optimization and incorporation of the solvation energy. From the structural
analysis of the tankyrase 2–class A ligand complexes, we found
that the averaged root-mean-square deviation for heavy atoms in the
QM region before and after the ONIOM-based geometry optimization of
each complex structure was 0.295 Å. An example of a typical structural
difference is shown in Figure 4. Although these structural changes are relatively small,
it is obvious from Figure 5 and Table 1 that the R and PI values between the binding energy,
ΔEbindgas from the MFMO calculations and the experimental
binding affinities are largely improved by structural refinement of
the ONIOM-based geometry optimizations. On the other hand, the R and PI values between ΔEbindgas values obtained
from the MM calculations and the experimental affinities are slightly
decreased following the ONIOM-based geometry optimization. From these
facts, we can point out that QM-based structural refinements are necessary
for an accurate description of protein–ligand interactions
using MFMO calculations. On the other hand, we also suggest that MM-based
structural refinement might be suitable for the description of protein–ligand
interactions using MM calculations (Figure 5).

optimization. The figure shows a superposition of the tankyrase 2–ligand
(C04) complex structures before and after ONIOM geometry optimization.
The heavy atoms of the QM regions before and after ONIOM geometry
optimization are shown by light gray and purple ball and stick models,
respectively. For these tankyrase 2–ligand (C04) complex structures
before and after ONIOM geometry optimization, the root-mean-square
deviation of the heavy atoms of the structures for the QM regions
is 0.311 Å.

complexes before and after ONIOM geometry optimization. R (or PI) values between the binding energies (ΔEbindgas) and

= 0).

In addition to structural refinements
by the ONIOM calculation,
the incorporation of solvation energy also improves the R and PI values, as shown in Figure 5. With regard to the effect of the solvation energy,
here, we show the binding affinities using conventional FMO with the
PB/SA solvation method (our scoring function in this study) and those
using conventional FMO with the polarized continuum model (PCM) solvation
method (see Materials and Methods). The binding
affinities obtained by conventional FMO with the above two solvation
methods are shown in Figures S3 and S4 in the Supporting Information. We report here the binding affinities
calculated without inclusion of the entropic term (i.e., α =
0). From these data, the binding affinities using conventional FMO
with the PB/SA method have a high correlation with the experimental
values (R = 0.900 and PI = 0.887). On the other hand,
although the binding affinities using conventional FMO with the PCM
method without the nonpolar term also show a high correlation with
the experimental values (R = 0.870 and PI = 0.870),
the binding affinities using the full PCM solvation effects, that
is, with the inclusion of polar and nonpolar solvation terms, did
not show a good correlation with the experimental values (R = 0.507 and PI = 0.251) (see Figure S4 in the Supporting Information). From the energy component
analysis in the full PCM solvation energy, it is obvious that the
contribution of dispersion energy, ΔEdisp, made the correlation worse remarkably for our system (see Table
S1 in the Supporting Information). Additionally,
the ΔGsolv,nonpolar values obtained
using the PCM method (14.79 to 23.29 kcal/mol) were larger than the
ΔGsolv,nonpolar values obtained
using the PB/SA method (−3.08 to −4.09 kcal/mol) and
also have the opposite sign. This different contribution of the nonpolar
solvation energy has a significant effect on the binding affinity
predictions. As Söderhjelm et al. have previously pointed out,37 we can conclude that the computational method
including a nonpolar term occasionally has a severe problem for the
biomolecular system. As shown in Figure 3 and Figures S3 and S4 in the Supporting Information, the ability to rank order
binding affinities using MFMO (or conventional FMO) with the MM-PB/SA
method had almost the same order as that seen using conventional FMO
with the PCM method not including the nonpolar term. Because the computational
cost of the MM-PB/SA method used in our scoring function is much lower
than that of the PCM solvation method, which was combined with the
conventional FMO calculation, we can conclude that the solvation energy
from the MM-PB/SA method is readily applicable for the ranking of
protein–ligand binding affinities. From an evaluation of class
A ligands, we can conclude that our scoring function can describe
the experimental tankyrase 2–class A ligand affinities relatively
well, although the effect of structural sampling was not considered
and the component of conformational entropy for the ligand does not
contribute appropriately to affinity prediction.

Evaluation
of Class A and Class B Ligands
In addition
to class A ligands, we also evaluated the ranking of all class B ligands
with flexible linker and ring parts using our computational approach
(see Figures S1 and S2 in the Supporting Information). Unlike class A ligands, multiple binding modes (two or three binding
modes) for each class B ligand were considered (see Materials and Methods section). As a result, the lowest scoring
value among the multiple scoring values was adopted as the calculated
binding affinity.

Figure 6 shows the correlation plots between the calculated binding
affinities (with the weighting factor α = 1 and α = 0)
and the experimental binding affinities. From this analysis, the R and PI values for the no entropic term (α = 0) were
0.856 and 0.874, respectively, which show a high ability to predict
experimental binding affinities, although these are slightly lower
than the result for class A ligands (see Figure 3). On the other hand, the affinity prediction
including the entropic term (α = 1) had a slightly lower ability
to predict affinity (R = 0.770 and PI = 0.780) compared
with the result of the binding affinity prediction without the entropic
term (α = 0), as shown in Figure 6. From these data, we can conclude that the entropic
term using the number of single rotatable bonds in the ligand does
not have a significant contribution in predicting the binding affinities
of tankyrase 2 ligands in the present study. In conclusion, we only
attach importance to the binding affinity predictions obtained without
the use of the entropic term (α = 0).

Figure 6 Correlation between the
experimental binding affinities and the
calculated binding affinities using our scoring function for both
class A and class B ligands. The abscissa and ordinate indicate the
experimental and calculated binding affinities, respectively. The
calculated binding affinities with the weighting factor α =
1 (left-hand figure) and those with the weighting factor α =
0 (right-hand figure) are shown. The filled and open circles indicate
class A ligands and class B ligands, respectively.

As stated above, we also analyzed the effect of
using multiple
binding modes for the nine class B ligands. To assess this effect,
we analyzed the binding affinity prediction obtained using only the
single binding mode with the lowest energy, using the LowModeMD method.38 We found that four out of nine class B ligands
have different binding affinities when comparing the data from a single
binding mode with data from multiple binding modes (see Figure S5
in the Supporting Information). In particular,
the binding affinity for the C29 ligand showed such a large difference
(Figure 7). The conformation
analysis shown in Figure 7 revealed that the binding pocket structures as well as the
ligand conformations were largely different. Figure 8 shows a comparison of the R and PI values for the experimental binding affinities and the calculated
binding affinities for the single binding mode and multiple binding
modes. It is clear that the use of multiple binding modes improves
the performance of prediction as compared with that of the single
binding mode, although the computational cost increases accordingly
with the increase in the number of binding modes.

Figure 7 Conformations near ligand
C29 used for affinity predictions of
the single binding mode and multiple binding modes. The binding conformation
of the single binding mode (left-hand figure) and that of the lowest
binding energy among the multiple binding modes (right-hand figure)
are shown. The molecular surface representation indicates the binding
pocket, where the hydrophobic region in the binding pocket is drawn
in blue and the hydrophilic region is drawn in red. The ligand is
shown by the ball and stick model.

Figure 8 Comparison of the correlation coefficients and PIs of the experimental
binding affinities and the calculated binding affinities obtained
using the single binding mode and multiple binding modes. The correlation
coefficient and PI values are shown in light gray and dark gray boxes,
respectively. The entropic term is not included (i.e., the weighting
factor α = 0).

Furthermore, the binding affinity predictions using MFMO
and conventional
FMO methods (α = 0) were compared to those obtained with the
other MM-based methods, including the scoring functions used in molecular
docking programs (GoldScore, ChemScore, ChemPLP, and Glide SP) and
the MM-PB/SA method, as shown in Figure 9 and Table S2.
It is clear that the R and PI values of the rank-ordering
of the MFMO method surpasses those of the MM-based methods. Among
them, the MM-PB/SA method showed a relatively good performance (R = 0.787 and PI = 0.801). On the other hand, it is clear
that the scoring functions for the molecular docking programs have
insufficient ability to predict the binding affinity. In addition,
the prediction obtained using our scoring function in the MFMO method
has a performance equivalent to that of the conventional FMO method
(R = 0.868 and PI = 0.866), in the same manner as
seen for the class A ligands.

Figure 9 Comparison of the experimental binding affinities
and the calculated
binding affinities obtained using the MFMO method, the conventional
FMO method, the MM-PB/SA method, and the four scoring functions of
molecular docking programs. The correlation coefficients and PIs are
shown in the left-hand and right-hand figures, respectively. The binding
affinity predictions using our scoring function based on the MFMO
and the conventional FMO methods (α = 0) were compared to those
of the other MM-based methods, including the scoring functions of
four molecular docking programs (GoldScore, ChemScore, ChemPLP, and
Glide SP) and the MM-PB/SA method. For each graph, the values to the
left of the dashed line correspond to the results of the MM-based
methods and the other values correspond to those of the QM-based methods.

Discussion
We
evaluated the ability to rank the binding affinities of tankyrase
2 ligands by combining MM and QM calculations. In our novel computational
approach (see Materials and Methods section),
the protein–ligand binding energies (ΔEbindgas) obtained
from the MFMO method on MM- and QM-based geometry-optimized structures
of protein–ligand complexes are used to predict the binding
affinity. In these protein–ligand binding energies, we previously
reported that the accuracy of the binding energy obtained from the
MFMO method was almost equivalent to that obtained using the conventional
FMO method, in spite of a reduction in computational costs.16 In the current study, to evaluate the ability
of binding affinity prediction by our computational approach, we classified
all ligands used into class A and class B ligands (see Figures S1
and S2 in the Supporting Information) based
on structural features and conformational flexibility. For the study
of class A ligands for which the binding mode could be reliably described
with reference to a crystal structure, we confirmed that our scoring
function, which is composed of binding energy, solvation energy, and
an entropic term, has a high ability to rank tankyrase 2–ligand
binding affinities (R > 0.856 and PI > 0.861)
(Figure 3), although
the effect
of structural sampling was not considered. In regard to the structural
sampling, Liu et al. reported the calculation of binding affinities
of 14 avidin-biotin analogues using the QM method.39 In their study, they used the electrostatically embedded
generalized molecular fractionation with the conjugate caps method,
one of the fragment-based QM approaches, with a conductor-like PCM
and indicated that the use of multiple protein–ligand structures
obtained from MD simulations improved the correlation coefficient
between the calculated binding affinities and experimental values,
as compared with the use of single protein–ligand structure.
This suggests that the sampling of protein–ligand structure
is effective for the prediction of protein–ligand binding affinity.
This will be an interesting subject in our future study. The binding
energy from the MFMO method and the solvation energy from the MM-PB/SA
method largely contributed to the increased ability to predict binding
affinity, however, the inclusion of the entropic term based on the
number of single rotatable bonds for each ligand was not effective
in predicting tankyrase 2–ligand binding affinities. With respect
to the solvation energy, we also demonstrated that the solvation energy
from the MM-PB/SA method also plays an important role in increasing
the ability to predict the binding affinity. The detailed analysis
on energy components of the solvation energy is discussed in Table
S3 in the Supporting Information. However,
we could not evaluate the binding affinity prediction using the MFMO
method in combination with the PCM method for two principle reasons:
(1) the computation of nonpolar PCM solvation implemented in the GAMMES
program is not suitable for tankyrase 2–ligand system used
in this study, as Söderhjelm et al. have already reported37 and (2) a poor balance of solvation energies
between the low layer and high layer in the MFMO method occurs because
of two factors; the region size of the high layer and/or the use of
small basis set at the low layer, which makes the binding affinity
prediction worse (data not shown). In addition, it is worth noting
that the structural refinement of the protein–ligand complexes
using the ONIOM calculations, which is one of the preprocessing processes
of protein–ligand binding affinity computations using our scoring
function, largely improved the correlation between the calculated
binding energies and experimental affinities. This suggests that the
use of a QM-based energy-minimized structure rather than an MM-based
energy-minimized structure is more desirable for the evaluation of
protein–ligand interaction using MFMO methods, even though
these structures differ only slightly from each other. A further adjustment
of the QM region might possibly lead to an adequate improvement in
the description of protein–ligand interactions.

In the
evaluation of all ligands, including class A and class B
ligands, we demonstrated that our prediction without the entropic
term had the best ability to rank tankyrase 2–ligand binding
affinities. For the class B ligands with a flexible linker and ring,
multiple binding conformations were used as the initial complex structures.
Our evaluation indicated that the use of multiple binding modes provided
more reliable tankyrase 2–ligand complex structures through
MM-based and ONIOM-based QM energy minimizations, which suggest that
our scoring function could provide more reliable binding affinities
by adopting the lowest binding affinity from among multiple energy-minimized
structures. However, the use of the multiple binding conformations
in our computational approach was accompanied by an increase in the
computational cost. For the 9 class B ligands, 23 ligand-binding conformations
were evaluated, so that the computational cost for a class B ligand
increased by about 2.5 times compared with that for a class A ligand.
In this context, because the computational time required to apply
the MFMO method is about 6 times less than that required for the conventional
FMO method, it should be possible to perform binding affinity predictions
within the actual time frame used for drug discovery research (see Materials and Methods).

The entropic term
using the number of single rotatable bonds for
each ligand did not contribute to an increase in the ability to rank
tankyrase 2–ligand binding affinities. This could possibly
be due to the fact that the degree of freedom of the rotatable bonds
is lost when the ligand binds to the binding pocket. Because class
B ligands, in particular, have more rotatable bonds compared with
class A ligands and the degrees of freedom at each of the rotatable
bonds are not all lost upon ligand binding, the conformational entropic
effect of each ligand will be overestimated. Structural analysis of
protein–ligand interactions suggests that single rotatable
bonds in the core and linker would be relatively strongly restricted
by forming hydrogen bonds with Gly1032 and Ser1068, but those of the
ring region would be not restricted (see Figure 2). In such a case, the number of restricted
single rotatable bonds (Nrot#) for all
ligands except compound C01 becomes a constant value of two (as seen
in Figures S1 and S2 in the Supporting Information). When Nrot# was used, our scoring function
(α = 1) shows R = 0.855 and PI = 0.874, which
are almost the same as the result of the scoring function without
the entropic term (α = 0) (Figures 6 and S6 in the Supporting Information). Therefore, we think there is some room for improvement
of the entropic term because the entropic term used in this study
is so simple for the tankyrase 2–ligand system. Other studies
have reported a good estimate of the entropic effect using the degrees
of freedom lost by both the protein and ligand on binding.20,40 Improvement of the entropic term will therefore be a focus in the
future.

Conclusions
We have shown the application of QM calculations
in the field of
drug discovery by reducing the severe problem of their computational
costs. In this paper, we evaluated the ability to rank the binding
affinity for tankyrase 2 ligands by combining both QM and MM methodologies.
The binding affinity prediction computed by using the binding energies
from the cost-effective MFMO method and the MM-based solvation energies
provided a high ability to rank the binding affinities of tankyrase
2 inhibitor analogues, and the performance surpassed those of several
MM-based methods. From this study, we emphasize the importance of
QM-based structural refinement and the generation of initial multiple
conformations for a flexible ligand to demonstrate the high ability
of the binding affinity prediction using the MFMO method. This is
the first report describing a practical evaluation of the MFMO method
for structure-based drug design. Although the method can further be
improved by the introduction of conformational sampling and a more
appropriate entropic term, we think that our binding affinity prediction
using the MFMO method and the MM-PB/SA method is a promising tool
for predicting the rank-ordering of protein–ligand binding
affinities in drug-discovery studies.

Materials and Methods
Overview
of Our Computational Approach
Our computational
approach to predict the rank-ordering of protein–ligand binding
affinities was carried out in four stages. First, we built initial
structures of the tankyrase 2–ligand complex using molecular
modeling techniques. Second, the solvated systems of the tankyrase
2–ligand complexes were obtained by energy minimization using
the MM force field. Third, after removing the solvent molecules, the
ONIOM method was employed for geometry optimization of the ligand
and only selected parts of the binding site for each MM energy-minimized
structure. Last, protein–ligand binding affinities were predicted
using our scoring function that is comprised of the binding energies
obtained using the MFMO method, the solvation energies obtained using
the MM-PB/SA method, and the conformational entropic term of the ligands
only.

Tankyrase 2 Ligands Used in This Study
Twenty-three
tankyrase 2 inhibitor structures and their inhibition activities (IC50) were obtained from the literature23 (see Figures S1 and S2 in the Supporting Information). The structures of these ligands are similar and have a common
structural feature. The common structural feature is that each ligand
consists of three parts, that is, a core, a linker, and a ring (Figure 2). Among these three
parts, it is expected that the characteristics of the linker and the
ring affect the conformational flexibility of each ligand. On this
basis, we classified all ligands into two classes, A and B, based
on the length of the linker and the number of single rotatable bonds
in the ligand. For modeling the structure of the tankyrase 2–ligand
complex, the specific conformation of a tankyrase 2–class A
ligand complex was easily modeled based on available X-ray crystallographic
information33,35 because the conformational flexibility
was relatively low. However, the specific conformation of tankyrase
2–class B ligand complex was not modeled easily because of
the flexibility near the linker and ring parts. Therefore, multiple
binding conformations generated by modeling techniques were used as
the initial conformations for tankyrase 2–class B ligand complexes
(Figure S7 in the Supporting Information).

Modeling of Tankyrase 2–Ligand Complex Structures
The structure of the tankyrase 2–ligand (C01) complex was
built based on the crystal structure of the ligand (C01) bound form
of tankyrase 2 (PDB code: 3KR8,33 see Figure 1). For the complex structures
containing ligands other than C01, the protein structure was built
based on the crystal structure of the tankyrase 2–ligand (C01)
complex, and the conformations of the other ligands were built by
referring to the X-ray crystallographic crystal structures of the
tankyrase1–ligand (C04) complex (PDB code: 4KRS(35)) because the PARP catalytic domains of tankyrase1 and tankyrase
2 are very similar in structure. For modeling of the initial structure
of each tankyrase 2–class A ligand complex, only the linker
and ring parts of the modeled ligand were energy-minimized. For modeling
of the initial structure of each tankyrase 2–class B ligand
complex, conformational samplings of only the linker and ring parts
of the modeled ligand were performed using the LowModeMD method.38 The sampled multiple conformations of each class
B ligand were used for the initial structure of each tankyrase 2–class
B ligand complex (see Figures S2 and S7 in the Supporting Information). The addition of hydrogen atoms for
the structures of the protein and inhibitors, energy minimization,
and the ligand conformational search were performed using the molecular
operating environment program (Chemical Computing Group Inc.).41

MM Energy Minimization
All MM energy
minimizations
were performed using AMBER12.42 The modeled
structures of tankyrase 2–ligand complexes were solvated in
a rectangular box containing TIP3P water molecules43 under periodic boundary conditions. The AMBER99SB force
field44 was adopted for the receptor proteins.
The parameters for the force field of the ligands were set using a
general amber force field.45 Here, the
partial charges for the ligands were calculated at the RHF/6-31G(d)
level using the Gaussian 0946 and the restrained
electrostatic potential method.47,48 In these computations,
the particle mesh Ewald method49 with a
cutoff distance of 8 Å was employed for electrostatic interactions,
and the same cutoff distance was also applied for the van der Waals
interactions. The ligand, water molecules, and protein residues that
were approximately 10 Å of the active center were allowed to
move, but other protein residues were fixed in all of the MM energy
minimizations (see Figure 10).

Figure 10 High-layer region used in the MFMO method. The high-layer
region
used in the MFMO method contains the ligand (purple ball and stick
model) and the following amino acid residues (residue numbers: 1030–1036,
1039, 1044, 1047–1052, 1054, 1058–1065, 1068–1072,
1074–1076, and 1138–1140; blue space-filled representation).
In addition, the ligand and the amino acid residues (residue numbers:
978–980, 1029–1039, 1044–1078, 1095–1101,
1125–1127, 1136–1141, and 1155), shown by the blue and
orange space-filled representation, are allowed to move during the
MM energy minimization.

Structure Refinement by ONIOM Calculations
The structures
of tankyrase 2-inhibitor complexes determined by MM energy minimization
were further refined by the ONIOM calculations to express nonbonding
interactions, such as hydrogen bonds. In the present calculations,
the ligand and only selected parts of the binding site, that is, the
entire Gly1032 residue and the side chain of Ser1068, were included
in the QM region. Gly1032 and Ser1068 correspond to the nearest neighbors
to the ligand and form several hydrogen bonds with it (see Figure 1). Parts other than
the QM region were defined as the MM region. In the ONIOM energy minimization,
only atoms in the QM region were allowed to move during the energy
minimization, and atoms in the MM region were frozen. The defined
QM and MM regions were treated with the DFT/B3LYP functional50−52 using the 6-31G(d) basis set in the QM regions and the universal
force field53 in the MM region, respectively.
All ONIOM computations were performed using Gaussian 09.46

Protein–Ligand Binding Energy by MFMO
Calculations
The protein–ligand binding energies were
obtained by FMO
calculations. In particular, to accelerate protein–ligand binding
energy calculations, we used MFMO calculations, as reported in our
previous study.16 The MFMO method introduces
layers to which each of the fragments of the system is assigned. Each
layer includes its own level of theory and basis set. First, in the
monomer calculations, all fragments of the system are computed at
the lowest layer 1 (commonly described as the lowest level of theory),
and the Coulomb field of the entire system is determined at the lowest
level of theory. The fragments belonging to the higher layers, such
as 2, 3, and others, are then recomputed at higher levels of theory.
Dimer calculations at the higher layers are performed with only the
two fragments belonging to the specific layer. Thus, the MFMO method
is designed to calculate the total energies at different layers with
different levels of theory. In this study of tankyrase 2–ligand
systems, the ligand and 35 amino acid residues were assigned as the
high layer (see Figure 10), which corresponds to a cutoff distance from the ligand
of around 6.0 Å. The MFMO calculations were treated with a level
of theory of HF/STO-3G for the lowest layer and of MP2/6-31G(d) for
the higher layer, and 2-body FMO (FMO2) with one amino acid residue
per fragment, denoted as FMO2-HF/STO-3G:MP2/6-31G(s). As shown in
our previous study,16 the binding energy
between a protein and the ligand is evaluated from the difference
between the gas-phase potential energy of the protein–ligand
complex and the sum of the gas-phase potential energies of the protein
and isolated ligand molecules calculated by the FMO or MFMO methods.
All binding energy calculations for FMO and MFMO methods were performed
using FMO program version 4.1,12 implemented
in the GAMESS program package.54

The MFMO and conventional FMO calculations for tankyrase 2–ligand
systems were carried out on our computer cluster with 4 nodes (16
Nehalem, 2.8 GHz cores each). The average actual time to compute the
MFMO calculation was 2.5 h and that for the FMO calculation was 15
h.

Scoring Function Used for the Prediction of Protein–Ligand
Binding Affinity
To predict the rank-ordering of ligands,
the binding affinity, ΔGbind, was
evaluated using the following scoring function. Our scoring function
is based on the MM-PB/SA framework.3 1   2   3   4   5  

In the above scoring function, each
term is calculated from a single energy-minimized structure. Therefore,
the effect of conformational sampling is not taken into account. ΔEbindgas is the gas-phase potential energy calculated from the MFMO calculation,
ΔGbindsolv is the solvation energy change occurring
upon protein–ligand association, and TΔSgas is the entropy term. Here, ΔEbindgas indicates the binding energy between the protein and the ligand,
which is the difference between the gas-phase potential energy of
the complex and the sum of the gas-phase potential energies of the
receptor and the ligand, as mentioned in our previous study.16 For the comparison with the binding energies
of MFMO, ΔEbindgas for all ligands was also evaluated from
the conventional FMO calculations and the MM calculations. The solvation
energies, Gsolv values, were calculated
using the MM-PB/SA method with AMBER 12. The polar solvation term, Gsolv,polar, was estimated using the PB equation,
with the atomic radii optimized by Tan and Luo with respect to the
reaction field energies computed in the TIP3P explicit solvents55 and AMBER charges. The grid spacing used was
0.5 Å. The dielectric constants inside and outside the molecule
were 1.0 and 80.0, respectively. For the nonpolar solvation term Gsolv,nonpolar, SASA represents the solvent-accessible
surface area that was calculated using Molsurf program, which is based
on analytical ideas primarily developed by Mike Connolly,56 and SURFTEN and SURFOFF were 0.00542 kcal/mol
Å2 and 0.92 kcal/mol, respectively. The probe radius
was 1.4 Å. For the comparison with the solvation energy from
the MM-PB/SA method, the PCM solvation57 method, which is implemented in the GAMESS program package,54 combined with the conventional FMO calculations
was also evaluated. In the PCM calculation, the polar term is the
electrostatic solvation energy, Ees, and
the nonpolar term is composed of three components: the creating energy
of a cavity in the solvent, Ecav, the
dispersion interactions between the solute and the solvent, Edisp, and the exchange repulsion, Erep. The entropic term, TΔSbindgas, was estimated using the number of single rotatable bonds for each
ligand. This is based on the idea that the degree of freedom of rotatable
bonds is lost in the binding pocket. Thus, the following equation
was used to obtain the TΔSbindgas value 6  where Nrot is
the number of single rotatable bonds for each ligand and α is
the weighting factor. A value of α = 1 assigns a conformational
penalty of 1 kcal/mol for each single rotatable bond for the ligand.
A weighting factor of 1 has been used in the previous studies.20,22 By contrast, a value of α = 0 indicates that the entropic
term is not taken into account. In this study, we compared two α
values, namely 1 and 0, for the scoring function. The prediction of
rank-ordering of tankyrase 2–ligand binding affinities was
assessed on the basis of the correlation coefficient R and the PI for the calculated affinities and the experimental affinities.
The PI, which was developed by Pearlman and Charifson,58 quantifies the compatibility of the calculated
affinities with the rank-ordering of the experimental affinities.
This PI ranged from −1 to +1, with +1 arising from perfect
predictions, −1 arising from predictions that are always incorrect,
and 0 arising from predictions that are completely random.

Comparison
with Other MM-Based Methods
To compare the
ability of rank-ordering of the binding affinities using our computational
approach with those of the other MM-based methods, we also performed
rescoring of the molecular docking and MM-PB/SA methods. Rescoring
of the molecular docking was performed using the Genetic Optimisation
of Ligand Docking version 5.3.059 and Glide
6.960,61 for Schrödinger 2015. Four scoring
functions namely GoldScore, ChemScore, ChemPLP, and Glide standard
precision mode were used, and the default settings for these scoring
functions were adopted. For the MM-PB/SA method, the binding energy
was evaluated using AMBER12.42 The force
field parameters were the same as those described in the above MM
energy minimization section. For evaluation of the solvation energy,
the solvation energy from the MM-PB/SA method was also used, as was
the case with our scoring function.
