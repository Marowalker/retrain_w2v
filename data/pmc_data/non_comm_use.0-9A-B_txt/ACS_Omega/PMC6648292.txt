Fused
deposition fabrication (FDF) three-dimensional printing is
a potentially transformative technology for fabricating pharmaceuticals.
The state-of-the-art technology is still in its infancy and requires
a concerted effort to realize its potential. One aspect includes the
processing parameters of FDF and the effect of formulation thereto,
which, to date, have not been thoroughly investigated. To progress
understanding, the effect of different molecular weight poly(ethylene
glycol)s (PEG) on polycaprolactone (PCL) loaded with ciprofloxacin
(CIP) was investigated. A rheometer was used, and adapted accordingly,
to analyze three processing aspects pertaining to FDF: viscosity,
solidification, and adhesion. The results revealed that both CIP and
PEG affected all three processing parameters. The salient findings
were that the ternary blend with 10% w/w PEG 8000 exhibited rheological
and adhesive properties ideal for FDF, as it provided a desirably
shear-thinning filament that solidified rapidly, and improved the
adhesion strength, in comparison to both the PCL-CIP binary blend
and other ternary blends. In contrast, the ternary blend with 15%
w/w PEG 200 was unfavorable; despite having a greater plasticizing
effect, whereby the viscosity was markedly reduced, the sample provided
no benefit to the solidification behavior of PCL-CIP and, in addition,
failed to display adhesive behavior, which is a necessity for a successful
print in FDF. The original findings herein set the precedent that
the effect of drug and PEG on FDF processing should be considered
beyond solely modifying the viscosity.

1 Introduction
Fused
deposition fabrication (FDF) is a form of additive manufacturing
(AM), and has recently garnered attention for fabricating drug-delivery
systems (DDS) due to its transformative potential in the field. FDF
can be thought of as an extension of the well-established hot melt
extrusion (HME) process, with the added advantages associated with
AM: rapid prototyping; high spatial resolution; digital precision;
and complex geometries attainable and integrable with other technologies,
such as medical imaging techniques.1 These
advantages allow the fabrication of personalized DDS, which is sought
after in the biomedical field,1 including
the pharmaceutical industry subsequent to the Precision Medicine Initiative
in 2015.2 For the pharmaceutical field,
the advantages include dose flexibility, improved patient compliance,
rapid administration, and improved medicine access.3 FDF affords researchers the opportunity to reduce their
laboratory footprint and resource expenditure as a number of devices
can be printed, including tablets,4 capsules,5 transdermal microneedles,6 catheters,7 and topical masks.8 Furthermore, the drug dissolution properties
can be altered without requiring further tools. For example, where
pore formers or freeze drying for traditional fabrication techniques
was required to incorporate porosity into DDS, this can be seamlessly
achieved by FDF without the need for additional materials or equipment.9 In comparison to HME, different shapes are attainable
without the need for multiple dies, which incidentally produces a
fixed cross-sectional geometry that unavoidably spans the length of
the extrudate. It has been stated that the short-term prospects are
likely to lie within early-phase drug development as three-dimensional
(3D) printing integration is likely to be attainable under current
regulatory pathways.3 An FDF printer compliant
with current good manufacturing practices has been recently built,
and the related processing conditions and product quality parameters
were also reported.5 The printer was used
to fabricate multicompartmental capsular systems that were originally
devised for personalized dosages. Goyanes et al. studied the in vivo
behavior of 3D printed drugs in rodents.10Research into dosage forms of varying geometries and sizes for improved
gastric emptying properties surmised that 3D printing could facilitate
preclinical testing of new drug candidates in animal models. The study
also concluded that 3D printing was capable of printing solid dosage
forms and variation in designs thereof affects disintegration in rodent
models. Suffice it to say, the state-of-the-art technology is relatively
new and requires concerted, multidisciplinary research to realize
its full potential for fabricating DDS.

To date, research has
been undertaken to understand the key processing
facets of 3D printing. Nasereddin et al. used principal component
analysis to predetermine filament suitability for FDF during the feeding
process. Using a texture analyzer to simulate the forces a filament
exhibits during feeding, the researchers demonstrated a method to
accurately distinguish between feedable and nonfeedable filaments.11 Zhang et al. analyzed different drug-containing
filaments consisting of different polymers and experimentally determined
that the ideal breaking stress should be above 2941 g/mm2 and breaking distance should be above 1 mm, to achieve optimal feeding
and printing conditions.12 Kollamaram et
al. further expanded the possibilities of FDF by demonstrating that
temperatures as low as 90 °C can be used to print thermolabile
drugs, such as Ramipril, by using Kollidon.13 The choice of polymer can be exploited to alter the release profile
of quinine,14 and polymers that have been
investigated via FDF thus far include polylactide (PLA), polycaprolactone
(PCL), Kollidon, Eudragit, poly(vinylpyrrolidone), poly(vinyl alcohol),
and hydroxypropyl methylcellulose.15 Furthermore,
both organic and inorganic additives have been incorporated to alter
the printing performance of the filament, including its thermal, mechanical,
and rheological properties.16

A number
of studies have incorporated plasticizers to facilitate
the processing of their DDS via FDF, thereby illustrating the indispensability
of plasticizers. However, the studies did not provide experimental
evidence regarding the effects of plasticizers and their relevance
to FDF processing.4,13,16−19 Okwuosa et al. relied on differential scanning calorimetry (DSC)
to deduce whether their polymeric system was affected by a plasticizer;
however, this only provides the evidence of plasticization as a function
of temperature but not shearing,20 given
that both temperature and shearing occur in FDF. Therefore, to complement
studies performed in this field, which have focused on aspects such
as shape design,4 dose adjustment,21 drug-release characteristics,22 and assessing the feasibility of polymers for FDF,14,23 an original rheological and mechanical perspective was provided
on the effect of plasticizers on processing facets pertinent to FDF.
Identifying suitable plasticizers, and the amount thereof, is important;
however, establishing validation methods to predict the printability
of filaments has thus far focused on assessing their mechanical properties.7

As with traditional fabrication techniques,
rheology is a key aspect
of FDF processing, yet it remains underutilized. Rheology allows for
analyses to be performed that can be correlated to the processing
performance of melt-based fabrication techniques24 and thereby preclude the need for time-consuming and costly
empirical trials. Rheological analyses have also been used to interpret
the polymeric structure of melts.24 FDF
is a relatively new technology in pharmaceutics, and thorough rheological
investigations are still needed to predict material performance. For
example, although FDF is an extension of HME, the mode of shearing
differs between the two technologies, and thus viscosities suitable
for HME may not be suitable for FDF. Moreover, the processing speed
and the layer-by-layer approach to three-dimensional shaping suggest
that the tolerance for expansion and shrinkage caused by the viscoelastic
properties thereof following extrusion may be different from that
of HME and other traditional melt fabrication techniques. Adhesion
to a substrate is also an important aspect of FDF, which is in contrast
to conventional fabrication techniques where it was considered undesirable.25−27 On the contrary, FDF requires the initial deposited layer to form
an adhesion to a preferably heated build plate with sufficient structural
integrity to establish a foundation for subsequent layers to be deposited.28 The layer to adhere to is required to resist
detachment from the build plate while either the build plate or nozzle
travels. Therefore, FDF presents new rheological and mechanical facets
that require elucidation to facilitate DDS processing and mitigate
processing failures (Figure 1).

Figure 1 Schematic of the fused deposition fabrication technique. The illustration
highlights rheological and mechanical facets of interest that will
be investigated herein.

The effect of different molecular weight poly(ethylene glycol)
(PEG) on polycaprolactone (PCL) loaded with ciprofloxacin (CIP) was
investigated. PEG has been previously used as a plasticizer to address
processing issues in other fabrication techniques, primarily the viscosity.29 The effect of PEG and different molecular weights
thereof has hitherto not been examined for FDF. It was hypothesized
that plasticization, in addition to affecting viscosity, would also
impact the solidification and adhesive qualities, which have not been
investigated for FDF. In this article, the effect of PEG on the viscosity,
solidification, and adhesive characteristics of PCL-CIP blends was
examined.

2 Results
2.1 Viscosity Measurement of
PCL-CIP-PEG Filaments
Filament complex viscosity was measured
at 130, 150, and 170 °C,
and the results are presented in Figure 2. The formulations were found to be shear-thinning
across all three temperature points, wherein an increase in angular
frequency (ω) (i.e., shearing rate) decreased the viscosity.
At 130 °C, neat PCL (nPCL) exhibited Newtonian plateau on the
order of 104 Pa s, until 1.7 rad/s, after which it began
to decrease notably and reached a viscosity of 103 Pa s.
The addition of 20% w/w CIP decreased the complex viscosity of PCL,
with an initial viscosity on the order of 103 Pa s, which
is calculated to be a decrease of 39%. The addition of 10% w/w PEG
200 into PCL-CIP further decreased the viscosity; the initial viscosity,
which was also on the order of 103 Pa s, decreased 76%.
Increasing the content of PEG 200 to 15% w/w had a marked increase
on the viscosity initially; however, the viscosity was comparable
to that of PCL-CIP-10P2 at 102 rad/s. Compared to PCL-CIP,
the initial decrease in viscosity was 14%; however, PCL-CIP-15P2 showed
markedly more shear-thinning than the binary blend. PCL-CIP-10P4 was
found to have an initial complex viscosity on the order of 104 Pa s, an increase of 73% in comparison to PCL-CIP. The sample
did not present with an evident Newtonian plateau, and hence was shear-thinning
from the outset to the extent that it possessed a final value on the
order of 102 Pa s, 1 order of magnitude lower than that
of PCL-CIP. Similar results were found for PCL-CIP-15P4, PCL-CIP-10P8,
and PCL-CIP-15P8, for which the initial viscosities were greater than
the binary blend, by 74, 161, and 143%, respectively; however, the
final viscosity was lower than that of PCL-CIP. Moreover, PCL-CIP-10P8
and -15P8 possessed initial viscosities greater than that of nPCL,
by 26 and 17%, respectively.

Figure 2 Complex viscosity for all of the filaments at
(a) 130, (b) 150,
and (c) 170 °C (n ≥ 6).

Increasing the temperature resulted in a decrease
in viscosity
for all of the filaments. For example, the complex viscosity of nPCL
decreased by 30 and 54%; PCL-CIP decreased by 28 and 41%; PCL-CIP-10P2
decreased by 5 and 2%; and PCL-CIP-15P8 decreased by 8 and 36%, at
150 and 170 °C, respectively. Similar changes as a result of
incorporating CIP and CIP with PEG into nPCL were found at both 150
and 170 °C to that observed at 130 °C. The incorporation
of CIP into nPCL reduced its viscosity between the measured frequency
range, a decrease of 50 and 51% for 150 and 170 °C, respectively.
The addition of PEG 200 further reduced the viscosity. At 150 °C,
both PEG 4000 and 8000 increased the initial viscosity of PCL-CIP
but were again more shear-thinning than PCL-CIP and exhibited lower
viscosities at higher angular frequencies. Again, the addition of
PEG 8000 was found to yield an initial viscosity greater than that
of nPCL at 150 and 170 °C. Increases of 32 and 49% at 150 and
170 °C, respectively, were observed for PCL-CIP-10P8 compared
to nPCL, and increases of 54 and 61% at 150 and 170 °C, respectively,
were observed for PCL-CIP-15P8. At 170 °C, PCL-CIP-15P4 was found
to possess lower viscosities than PCL-CIP across the investigated
angular frequency range, with the difference further increasing as
the angular frequency increased. Thus, different molecular weights
of PEG, and varying content thereof, produced different results at
different temperatures. In general, it can be summarized that the
addition of both 10 and 15% w/w PEG 200 synergistically plasticized
PCL, along with CIP, whereas PEG 4000 and 8000 were found, in all
but one case, to increase the initial viscosity, but due to being
more shear-thinning, the increase in viscosity was limited to low
shear rates.

For insight into the microstructures of nPCL and
PCL blends, the
storage modulus (G′) and loss modulus (G″) were also investigated, and the results are portrayed
in Figures 3 and 4, respectively. The results demonstrated that with
increasing angular frequency, the G′ increased.
It was discovered that PCL-CIP and the ternary blends with 10P4, 15P4,
10P8, and 15P8 possessed an initially greater storage modulus than
nPCL, with the latter possessing a value 1 order of magnitude greater
than nPCL. However, the increase in G′ as
a result of the incorporation of the said components was reversed
at higher angular frequencies, whereby at 101 rad/s, nPCL
possessed the greatest storage modulus until the end of the test.
PCL-CIP-15P2 possessed an initial value comparable to nPCL, except
for at 130 °C, where it was lower. For PCL-CIP-10P2, the
entire profile, including the initial value, 2 was lower
than that of nPCL. Therefore, the data highlighted that the higher-molecular-weight
PEG temporarily increased the storage modulus in comparison to nPCL,
whereas PEG 200 either had no initial effect or reduced the storage
modulus.

Figure 3 Storage modulus for all of the filaments at (a) 130, (b) 150, and
(c) 170 °C.

Figure 4 Loss modulus for all
formulations at (a) 130, (b) 150, and (c)
170 °C.

The loss modulus was
also found to increase with increasing angular
frequency for all samples. At 130 °C, PCL-CIP was found to possess
a lower G″ than nPCL. The G″ further decreased with the addition of PEG 200 across all
angular frequencies, and was observed also at 150 and 170 °C.
Conversely, PEG 4000 and 8000 exhibited an initially greater value
that was eventually surpassed by PCL-CIP at higher shearing rates.
At higher temperatures, the initial gain of PEG 4000 was found to
decrease, while at 170 °C, PCL-CIP exhibited a G″ greater than PCL-CIP-10P4 and PCL-CIP-15P4 throughout the
measured range. PCL-CIP-15P8 maintained an initial G″ comparable to that of nPCL at 150 and 170 °C, and similarly
to that at 130 °C, G″ was greater for
nPCL with increasing angular frequency. PCL-CIP-10P8 initially possessed
a greater loss modulus than nPCL but was comparable by the end of
the test. Hence, in contrast to the storage modulus data, none of
the blends exhibited a loss modulus value notably greater than nPCL
at low angular frequencies.

2.2 Rheological Stability of
Filaments
A time ramp at 170 °C was performed to determine
the rheostability
of the samples, and the results are presented in Figure 5. The analysis confirmed that
the samples were stable for 5 min. The implications of this result,
for both rheological analyses and 3D printing, are discussed in Section 3.

Figure 5 Time ramp performed at
170 °C, with strain and frequency of
0.1% and 10 rad/s, respectively (n ≥ 3).

2.3 Viscoelastic
Changes of PCL-CIP-PEG during
Cooling
Following extrusion, the extrudate was deposited
onto a heated build plate, in which the material undergoes cooling
and consequently solidification. To determine the effects of CIP and
PEG on PCL during this stage, dynamic cooling ramps were performed
to examine the elastic behavior thereof. Figure 6 displays the storage modulus, loss modulus,
and tan δ when cooled from 170 to 40 °C, which corresponded
to the nozzle temperature and build plate temperature, respectively.
The cooling ramps were performed following the shear test performed
as shown in Figure 2 at 170 °C. The storage modulus (G′)
is the elastic component of materials, and as Figure 6a demonstrates, the G′
of all samples increased exponentially as the temperature decreased.
PCL possessed the highest G′ throughout the
cooling ramp, and the rate thereof increased once the temperature
was below 100 °C. The addition of CIP reduced the elastic component
of PCL, with a similar exponential rise detected. The addition of
PEG 200 reduced the elastic component of PCL-CIP, and the exponential
increase in G′ was markedly less pronounced.
Alternatively, the inclusion of PEG 4000 resulted in comparable increases
in G′ to that of PCL-CIP, whereas a considerable
rise in G′ was observed with the inclusion
of PEG 8000 into PCL-CIP, albeit the G′ was
comparable at 160 °C. Table 1 presents the decrease in moduli at the start and end
of the G′ test of the PCL blends in comparison
to neat PCL. As enumerated, the difference in G′
was lower at the end of the test (40 °C) than at the start of
the test.

from 170 to 40 °C. All samples were presheared from 0.1 to 100
rad/s prior to analysis. (a) Storage modulus, (b) loss modulus, and
(c) tan δ (n ≥ 3).

Respect to Neat PCL at the Start and End of the Cooling Rampa

PCL-CIP-15P8	72.8	23.5	61.4	10.9	
a All results represent
a percentage
decrease unless preceded by a “+”, which denotes a percentage
increase.

A similar profile
in the loss modulus was observed in all of the
samples, whereby cooling of the filaments to between 100 and 120 °C
resulted in an exponential increase in the modulus thereafter (Figure 6b). PCL-CIP-10P8
possessed the greatest G″, which was followed
by neat PCL and PCL-CIP-15P8. The lowest G″
was again observed in the blends containing PEG 200. In comparison
to the storage modulus, the loss modulus of PCL was affected to a
lesser extent. Table 1 presents the decrease in both moduli of the PCL blends with respect
to neat PCL. The results revealed that the percentage decrease in
the storage modulus was greater than that of the loss modulus. Nonetheless,
the incorporation of CIP and CIP with PEG affected the elastic and
viscous components of PCL.

Figure 6c illustrates
the tan δ results obtained during cooling, which is the
ratio between the loss modulus and storage modulus. Values above and
below 1 indicate that a sample is predominantly viscous and predominantly
elastic, respectively. The data revealed that the tan δ
values decreased for all samples with decreasing temperature between
170 and 40 °C and were approaching 1. Neat PCL had a tan δ
value of 1.0 at 40 °C when rapidly cooled; thus, it transitioned
from a predominantly viscous material to a solid in the probed range.
PCL-CIP had a tan δ value of 1.7: the addition of 10
and 15% w/w PEG 200 resulted in values of 2.4 and 1.9, respectively;
the addition of 10 and 15% w/w PEG 4000 resulted in values of 1.5
and 1.4, respectively; and the addition of 10 and 15% w/w PEG 8000
resulted in values of 1.2 and 1.3, respectively. Thus, the addition
of CIP into PCL retarded its ability to solidify when cooled to 40
°C, but the discrepancy was minimized through the addition of
higher-molecular-weight PEG. Despite only neat PCL achieving a predominantly
solid state upon reaching 40 °C, it should be highlighted that
the gradient of the PCL blends was markedly higher than that of neat
PCL. In other words, the rate of solidification was greater in PCL
blends, as Table 2 delineates.

Table 2 Slope of the tan δ Values

PCL-CIP-15P4	0.0316	70	0.95	
PCL-CIP-15P8	0.0272	45	0.99	
a The percentage increase over neat
PCL is also included to illustrate that the blends had a larger gradient
and thus exhibited a higher rate of solidification.

Polymer melts are susceptible to
expansion. Moreover, the transition
from high temperature to room temperature induces internal stresses
that manifest into the material shrinking. The said behavior results
in temperature-induced warpage, whereby the material contracts, and
in the context of FDF, can result in the print de-adhering from the
build plate. Warpage is a concern in FDF, particularly for large prints,
which can result in failed prints. The rheometer employed in this
study is equipped with axial motion and sensors, which were utilized
to measure the expansion and subsequent shrinkage.

In simulating
the events as the filament exits the nozzle, the
expansion was measured while the temperature was rapidly reduced from
170 to 40 °C, and the results are portrayed in Figure 7. Neat PCL was found to undergo
the largest expansion, peaking at 4.7 ± 0.4%, and followed by
shrinkage. PCL-CIP-15P8 exhibited the second largest expansion peaking
at 3.6 ± 0.5%, and followed by shrinkage. PCL-CIP had the third
largest expansion at 2.5 ± 0.4%, followed by PCL-CIP-15P4 and
PCL-CIP-10P4 at 2.5 ± 0.06 and 1.5 ± 0.03%, respectively.
PCL-CIP-10P8 possessed a maximum shrinkage of 1.41 ± 0.15%. The
inclusion of PEG 200 resulted in the smallest expansion of 1.5 ±
0.007 and 1.2 ± 0.006% for 15 and 10% w/w PEG 200, respectively.
In addition, and apart from PCL-CIP-15P8, the onset of shrinkage started
at lower temperatures compared to neat PCL. Therefore, the addition
of CIP and PEG affected the maximum expansion that PCL underwent,
as well as the onset thereof.

Figure 7 Expansion of filaments measured as a function
of temperature during
the cooling ramp (n ≥ 3).

The shrinkage behavior of samples was also analyzed with
a dwell
time of 5 min. The analysis revealed that all of the samples had a
tendency to shrink at 40 °C, as depicted in Figure 8. During the isothermal test,
neat PCL did not shrink until after 169 ± 1 s, with a maximum
shrinkage of 1.7 ± 0.1%. PCL-CIP-15P2 exhibited a similar delayed
shrinkage, whereby shrinkage occurred after 222 ± 7 s, and a
maximum of 0.8 ± 0.2% shrinkage was recorded. PCL-CIP-10P2 was
found to initially increase by 0.2 ± 0.03% for the first 108
± 8 s, followed by shrinkage of 3.5 ± 0.2%, thus giving
a total shrinkage of 3.7%. For the binary blend of PCL-CIP, the shrinkage
commenced after 33 ± 0.5 s and proceeded until the end of the
test, with a maximum of 4.9 ± 0.1% shrinkage. Similar profiles
were observed for PCL-CIP-10P4, -10P8 -15P4, and -15P8, with maximum
shrinkages of 4.5 ± 0.01, 4.2 ± 0.12, 4.3 ± 0.05, and
4.8 ± 0.20%, respectively. Hence, the addition of CIP induced
a greater axial shrinkage in PCL, and the addition of different PEG
reduced the maximum linear shrinkage by different amounts.

Figure 8 Axial shrinkage
measured at 40 °C following the cooling ramp
(n ≥ 3).

2.4 Adhesive Properties of PCL-CIP-PEG Following
Shearing
Once deposited onto a heated build plate, the extrudate
should adhere thereto and form a foundation for subsequent layers
until the layer-by-layer process is complete. For this reason, the
adherence characteristics were also measured using the tack function
of the rheometer at 40 °C, following shearing at 170 °C
to simulate FDF. The adhesion results are illustrated in Figure 9. If the debonding
curve has an equal increase and decrease in force, then the locus
of material failure is at the interface (i.e., adhesive failure).
Alternatively, if a gradual decrease follows the abrupt rise in stress,
then the failure is said to be both adhesive and cohesive. Adhesion
is the tendency of different materials to bond together, whereas cohesion
is the tendency of similar materials to form a bond.30

Figure 9 Adhesive test performed using the rheometer. All samples were presheared
from 0.1 to 100 rad/s at 170 °C, cooled to 40 °C, and subsequently
analyzed for their adhesive properties (n ≥
3).

The test revealed that the formulated
neat PCL filaments were capable
of adhering at 40 °C, with a peak yield stress of 1959 ±
82 kPa. The shape of the curve was asymmetrical, which is indicative
of cohesive failure. The addition of CIP considerably reduced the
maximum adhesive force to 539 ± 14 kPa, but the graph remained
asymmetrical. Similar profiles was observed for PCL-CIP-10P2, -10P4,
and -10P8 with peak forces of 581 ± 5, 468 ± 3, and 773
± 56, respectively. The peak adhesive force decreased when the
PEG content increased to 15% w/w, resulting in PCL-CIP-15P2, -15P4,
and -15P8 exhibiting values of 166 ± 3, 229 ± 6, and 613
± 19 kPa, respectively. Moreover, the curve of PCL-CIP-15P2 exhibited
an abrupt decrease, which was indicative of adhesive failure.31,32 The photograph inset of PCL-CIP-15P2 in Figure 9 exemplifies the lack of adhesion bonding.
The test was repeated for PCL-CIP-15P2 with a dwell period of 10 min
at 40 °C, and in another separate test where the preshearing
was removed; however, both had an unremarkable effect and the sample
maintained its adhesive failure (data not included). The analysis
demonstrated that the addition of CIP and PEG considerably reduced
the peak adhesive force of PCL, with further decreases observed in
PCL-CIP-15P2 and 15P4. Finally, only PCL-CIP-15P2 failed in a solely
adhesive manner.

3 Discussion
Ternary
blends of polycaprolactone, ciprofloxacin, and poly(ethylene
glycol) of different molecular weights were successfully fabricated
using a hot melt extruder, which were intended for 3D printing using
a fused deposition fabrication technique. PEG was incorporated to
modify the characteristics of the drug device, and in this paper,
the effects thereof with respect to rheology and mechanical characteristics
were investigated. A subsequent publication will report on the FDF
findings. Rheology is an indispensable tool that can facilitate understanding
the effect of formulation on processing33 and elucidating the drug–polymer miscibility,34 as well as serve as prefigure to the tensile
properties of polymers.35

To the
author’s best understanding, rheological analyses
performed in the field of FDF and pharmaceutics have solely focused
on the effect of formulation on viscosity.36−39 This is indeed important and
is the first rheological event encountered in FDF. A previous work
by Boetker et al. has found complex viscosities on the order of 103 and 104 Pa s to be suitable for FDF printing,37 which is similar to this work. Holländer
et al. found viscosities on the order of 103 Pa s when
measured using steady-state shearing.38Steady-state and dynamic-state shearings are comparable provided
that the Cox–Merz rule is applicable, and it will be discussed
in the following publication.

Previous research has reported
indomethacin to decrease the viscosity
of PCL,38 and the present study confirmed
CIP to have a similar effect. The data revealed the degree of plasticization
by CIP to be temperature-dependent, as a greater decrease in viscosity
was observed in comparison to neat PCL at 150 and 170 °C than
at 130 °C. Both the storage and loss moduli were examined to
elucidate the changes in viscosity. The storage modulus is used to
provide insight into polymer elasticity24 and entanglement,40 whereas the loss
modulus is a reflection of the energy dissipated, such as that from
molecular friction.41,42 It was evident that the decrease
in viscosity was due to a decrease in the loss modulus, in which chain
slippage increased with the substitution of 20% w/w PCL for CIP. Interestingly,
an increase in G′ was observed at low ω,
which is believed to be due to CIP agglomeration, effectively behaving
as an inorganic filler in a polymer.24 The
deagglomeration thereof produced the inflection point delineated in G′ (Figure 3) and thereafter presented with a similar slope to that of
nPCL. Previous studies have found that increasing the filler content
results in an increase in G′ at low ω,43−47 which is indicative of agglomeration.43,44 Nevertheless,
the initial increase in elasticity was insufficient to increase the
viscosity of PCL-CIP at low ω. The viscosity data infer that
lower extrusion pressures will be needed for PCL-CIP to flow in comparison
to nPCL. Moreover, the decrease in loss modulus indicated no interaction
between PCL and CIP (i.e., an immiscible system).48 DSC data obtained by the author confirmed that it was an
immiscible system (data not presented herein).

The incorporation
of PEG 200 yielded the lowest viscosities, which
was expected due to the proportional relationship between plasticizer
molecular weight and viscosity.49−51 Unlike the other PEGs, the temperature
was sufficient in decreasing the viscosity in relation to PCL-CIP,
whereas higher-molecular-weight PEGs required shearing in addition.
The synergistic decrease in viscosity with the inclusion of PEG 200
was again evident from the viscoelastic data, as the addition thereof
reduced both G′ and G″.
In contrast to the higher-molecular-weight PEG, PEG 200 reduced the
level of entanglement of PCL-CIP and also increased the free volume
of the melt, thereby effectively lubricating the chains,52 and hence the lower G″.

At lower shearing rates, PCL-CIP-10P4 and -15P4 exhibited viscosities
greater than PCL-CIP. The moduli data revealed that at lower frequencies,
both G′ and G″ were
greater than that of PCL-CIP, thus demonstrating that PEG 4000 increased
the system’s stiffness and molecular friction as a result of
the polymeric system being immiscible. Except for at 170 °C,
the viscosity of PCL-CIP-15P4 was lower than that of CIP, which again
was due to the former possessing a lower G″
despite a greater G′. It can be deduced that G″ was a better determinant of complex viscosity
than G′. Furthermore, the moduli results also
revealed why only the viscosity of PCL-CIP-15P8 was greater than that
of nPCL at lower frequencies, as it exhibited comparable G″, yet G′ was greater by 1 order of
magnitude at lower frequencies, across all temperature points. Herein,
the increase in G′ at low frequencies between
PCL and PEG 4000 and 8000 was due to the relatively high-molecular-weight
PEGs dispersed within PCL as droplets. Scanning electron microscopy
(SEM) images of PCL-CIP-15P8 were compared to those of both nPCL and
PCL-CIP, which confirmed that PEG 8000 was dispersed within PCL as
droplets. The SEM images are provided in the Supporting information. An increase in G′ at low
frequencies is well known to be reflective of an immiscible system,53 and has been previously ascribed to the excess
stress exhibited at the interfacial region between the polymers.54 This resulted in the blends thereof possessing
higher shear-thinning characteristics. Previous studies have reported
high-molecular-weight PEGs to be immiscible with PCL.55−58 The effect of low-molecular-weight PEG on PCL observed herein was
similar to that observed for polylactide (PLA), in which small PEG
molecules capable of inserting between the PLA chains were better
plasticizers. The time ramp confirmed that the decrease in viscosity
for all blends was due to shearing and not time (Figure 5). Other causes of viscosity
changes with respect to time include material degradation, which presents
as rheopectic behavior; however, this was also not observed, and hence,
it can be concluded that no significant degradation took place.

The advantage of reducing the viscosity allows printing to be performed
at lower temperatures, which, for example, could allow thermally labile
drugs to be printed using FDF that would otherwise degrade at high
temperatures. However, a disadvantage of the viscosity being too low
is that it could lead to premature seepage, given the orientation
of the nozzle. In FDF, prior to extrusion, the nozzle is initially
heated to the designated temperature while housing the filament. If
the viscosity is too low, then the filament can begin to drip or flow
before pressure is applied. This phenomenon is undesirable as it wastes
material and could result in poor prints. Thus, from this study, PCL-CIP-15P8
was identified as a promising formulation as it possessed the highest
viscosities at low shear rates, and yet at higher shear rates, it
flowed similar to both neat PCL and PCL blends.

Following extrusion,
the material is required to solidify to provide
the structural integrity to support the deposition of ensuing layers.
The moduli of all formulations were found to increase as the temperature
decreased. This suggested the polymeric network for all exhibited
recoverable deformation despite being presheared at large-amplitude
oscillatory shear. The addition of CIP and CIP with PEG reduced the
time it required for PCL to solidify, as only nPCL was predominantly
solid, whereas PCL blends were still predominantly liquid by the end
of the test. Thus, this study revealed that the addition of drug and
PEG impacted the cooling dynamics of polymer melts and should be investigated
in addition to the viscosity. The results suggest that a lower FDF
processing speed may be required to ensure that the PCL blends solidify
and prevent defects such as “elephant foot”, in which
the upper layers press down on the foundation layer before it solidifies,
consequently causing it to protrude.59

This study further revealed that the expansion and shrinkage the
different materials underwent during cooling having been subjected
to a preshear. Shrinkage is caused by thermal contraction as the material
is rapidly cooled by the large thermal gradient of the surrounding
air.60 It was concluded that the addition
of CIP and PEG reduced the tendency of PCL to expand, which again
is related to their storage and loss moduli. The incorporation of
CIP and PEG increased the tendency of the PCL to shrink at 40 °C.
This is due to the longer cooling times required for the PCL blends,
as longer cooling times give higher mobility to molecular chains to
form crystalline structures and thus the higher shrinkage.61 Previous work on injection molding reported
an increase in thermoplastic starch shrinkage percentage difference
when glycerol, the plasticizer, content was increased from 10 to 18
wt %.62 Thus, the effect of chain mobility
through plasticization should be considered during cooling, in addition
to its desired effect on extrusion flow. Indeed, a thermal mechanical
analyzer could be utilized to determine the level of expansion or
shrinkage exhibited by the polymer, but the added benefit of the approach
proposed herein is that the rheometer allows for a preshearing, hence
providing a better reflection of the events occurring in FDF. A significant
dimensional change could lead to warpage,60 and the residual stress that causes shrinkage can also affect the
mechanical properties63 of the solidified
print; hence, characterizing dimensional changes can aid in the preempting
of processing issues. PCL-CIP-15P2 produced the least recorded shrinkage,
but this is believed to be erroneous due to its inability to adhere
to the rheometer, as determined by the adhesive test (Figure 9), and hence, the shrinkage
thereof was not detected by the sensor.

The final stage of filament
deposition ensures that the material
adheres to the build plate. This study revealed that although the
addition of CIP and PEG reduced the adhesive force of nPCL, a significant
adhesion was maintained, except for PCL-CIP-15P2, which failed in
an adhesive manner.31 Adhesive failure
is undesirable as it suggests that the material is unlikely to adhere
to the build plate and thereby unable to establish a foundation layer
for the print. Previous works have noted that higher printing speeds,
and therefore higher shear rates, caused a decrease in adhesion strength,30 and for that reason, PCL-CIP-15P2 was retested
without any preshear, but adhesion failure was once again observed.
In addition, to see whether more time was needed for the macromolecules
of the polymer to adhere to the build plate, a dwell time of 10 min
was incorporated prior to the adhesive test, but again adhesion was
not observed. Therefore, although plasticization of melts is regularly
sought after for improving flow behavior, considering the adhesive
consequence thereof.

The decrease in adhesive strength in PCL-CIP
is likely to be due
to the low solubility between the two materials.64,65 Previous works on transdermal patches have reported a decrease in
adhesive forces as a result of drug incorporation.66 For example, Gullick et al. found that increasing the amount
of captopril above 13% w/w reduced the work of detachment of bioadhesive
polymers.67 Michaelis et al. reported that
an ibuprofen concentration above 1% reduced the adhesiveness of their
polymer.68 The addition of higher-molecular-weight
polymers did not significantly affect the maximum peak stress of PCL-CIP,
except for when PEG 4000 was increased from 10 to 15% w/w. A notable
decrease in adhesiveness was also observed when the addition of PEG
200 was increased from 10 to 15% w/w. Repka and McGinity found PEG
to decrease the adhesion strength of hydroxypropylcellulose hot-melt-extruded
films containing polycarbophil.69 They
postulated that many of the reactive sites available to form adhesion
to their substrate were occupied by PEG, thereby decreasing the adhesive
properties. Fisher and Rowe (1976) also recorded a decrease in adhesion
force in hydroxypropyl methylcellulose films when propylene glycol
was increased from 10 to 20%.70 Rowe (1976)
reported that as the molecular weight of PEG decreased, the mole fraction
of interactive hydroxyl group increased.71−73 Accordingly,
PCL-CIP-15P2, possessing the lowest-molecular-weight PEG and at the
highest concentration thereof, may have saturated the available sites
for bonding to the substrate to the extent that the blend could not
form an adhesion thereto. Moreover, PEG 200 has been reported to display
preferential movement toward the top surface of polymer compared to
other plasticizers.74 Considering that
PEG 200 is more volatile than PEG 4000 or 8000, its movement to the
surface may have been expedited when subjected to high temperatures.
Consequently, as a liquid PEG at room temperature, unlike PEG 4000
and 8000, which are solid PEGs, it may have lubricated the surface
of PCL and thereby prevented adhesion.

In summary, from an FDF
perspective, PEG 8000 was determined as
the ideal viscosity modifier for the present polymeric system. PEG
8000 provided high viscosity at low shear rates but was strongly shear-thinning;
was found to exhibit a lower tan δ when cooled from 170
to 40 °C than PCL-CIP; and exhibited a higher adhesion peak stress
than PCL-CIP while maintaining adhesion to a dissimilar substrate.
These qualities suggest that PCL-CIP-10P8 is the most stable ternary
blend at high temperatures, yet can flow with increasing shear, can
solidify quicker and thus improve the processing speed over PCL-CIP,
and can adhere to the heated build plate, thereby establishing a foundation
layer for the print. The incorporation of PEG 4000 was found to be
the second most effective excipient when considering the aforementioned
criteria. PEG 200 was found to be the least-compatible additive for
PCL-CIP, with a limited FDF processability of 10% w/w.

4 Conclusions
In fused deposition fabrication, filaments are
required to flow
at high temperature, solidify rapidly, and adhere to the build plate.
In this work, the said processing facets were investigated. A rheometer
was used to measure the complex viscosity and viscoelastic properties
during cooling. The results demonstrated that a binary blend of PCL
and CIP was found to possess a lower viscosity, increase the time
needed for solidification, and decrease the adhesion strength, in
comparison to neat PCL. The addition of PEG produced different responses
depending on the molecular weight. PEG 200 was found to augment the
effect of CIP by further reducing the viscosity and increasing the
solidification time. Regarding the adhesive strength, the incorporation
of 15% w/w PEG 200 produced a blend that failed in an adhesive manner.
The inclusions of PEG 4000 or 8000 was a better excipient candidate
for FDF, and the addition of 10% w/w PEG 8000 yielded filaments that
were desirably more shear-thinning, solidified quicker, and enhanced
the peak adhesion strength in comparison to PCL-CIP. The essence of
the article illustrated that processing aspects other than viscosity
should be measured to determine formulation suitability for FDF and
that different molecular weights of PEG produced distinct effects
on the viscosity, cooling, and adhesive properties of PCL-CIP.

g/mol), acetic acid (96%),
ciprofloxacin (98.0%), and poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG, Mw = 4000 and 8000 g/mol) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich
Chemie GmbH (Steinheim, Germany, and St. Louis). Poly(ethylene glycol)
(Mw = 200 g/mol) was obtained from Fluka.
Acetone (≥99.5%) was purchased from VWR (France), and dichloromethane

were used without further purification.

5.2 Fabrication
Process of Drug-Delivery Device
5.2.1 Solvent
Casting
The drug-loaded
PCL films were initially blended using solvent casting to facilitate
mixing. First, PCL granules were dissolved in DCM at room temperature
to prepare PCL solutions with different concentrations. Then, PEG
was added to the solution and stirred for 5 min. Ciprofloxacin solution
was prepared separately by adding 1 g thereof to 10 mL acetone and
adjusting the pH of solution to 3 using acetic acid. Both the ciprofloxacin
and PCL solution were then mixed and stirred for 5 min. The solutions
were cast on dust-free Petri dishes, which were covered with a lid,
and the solvent was allowed to evaporate in ambient conditions and
at room temperature for 3 days. The films contained 20% w/w drug and
different amounts of PEG and PCL. Samples were named based on the
composition and percentage and molecular weight of PEG, and are delineated
in Table 3.

5.2.2 Hot Melt Extrusion
A 5 cc twin
screw extruder (DSM Xplore, the Netherlands) was employed to generate
the filaments for FDF printing. The solvent-cast films were introduced
to the HME and extruded using a temperature and a torque speed of
120 °C and 100 rpm, respectively, with a total circulation time
of 3 min. The extrudates were cooled in ambient conditions. Examples
of fabricated films are portrayed in Figure 10.

with (b) a closer
perspective to highlight the difference in color. The filament in
the bottom row is of neat PCL (white color), the middle is of PCL-CIP,
and the top is of PCL-CIP-15P8.

5.3 Rheological Characterization
The
DHR2 (TA Instruments) was used for both rheological and mechanical
analyses, with an 8 mm parallel plate geometry and an analysis gap
of 0.5 mm. The Trios software that was provided by the manufacturer
was used for both setting the parameters and analyses. All of the
measurements began at high temperatures. Upon reaching the desired
temperature, the sample was placed centrally onto the Peltier plate,
and the upper geometry was lowered to the trimming gap of 0.55 mm.
Any excess material was trimmed before the upper geometry was further
lowered to the analysis gap. The test was immediately started once
the analysis gap was reached. For Sections 5.3.3–5.3.5, where multiple procedures were used,
the Trios software was used to write scripts that allowed one procedure
to immediately commence following the previous procedure.

5.3.1 Oscillatory Frequency Sweep Test
The oscillation frequency
tests were performed to obtain the complex
viscosity as a function of frequency. Tests were conducted at 130,
150, and 170 °C, with a strain of 0.1% and an angular frequency
(ω) range of 0.1–100 rad/s. The parameters were determined
following an oscillatory amplitude sweep performed on PCL (i.e., control
sample) to determine the linear viscoelastic region. The amplitude
test was performed at 170 °C, with an angular frequency of 1
rad/s and a strain range of 0.01–1000%. The amplitude sweep
revealed a yield in strain on the order of 100, and consequently,
a strain of 0.1% was used to ensure that the frequency sweep measurements
began in the linear viscoelastic region for the control sample.

5.3.2 Oscillatory Time Ramp
Time ramp
measurements were performed at 170 °C for 5 min. A strain of
0.1% and an angular frequency of 0.1 rad/s were selected, which ensured
that the tests were performed in the terminal region.

5.3.3 Oscillatory Cooling Ramps
For the
cooling dynamics, samples were first sheared at 170 °C according
to the above frequency sweep protocol (Section 5.3.1), after which the stage was cooled to
40 °C at 50 °C/min while the viscoelastic parameters were
measured at a strain and angular frequency of 0.1% and 10 rad/s, respectively.

5.3.4 Expansion and Shrinkage Measurements
For measuring the expansion during cooling, samples were presheared
at 170 °C using the protocol detailed in Section 5.3.1. The samples were then
cooled from 170 to 40 °C at 50 °C/min with a strain and
ω of 0.1% and 1 rad/s, respectively, all the while applying
an axial compressive force of 0.1 N. The protocol was repeated for
the shrinkage measurement, while at 40 °C, an axial tensile force
of 0.1 N was applied until the end of the test, which was 300 s.

5.3.5 Adhesive Measurement
The samples
were first presheared at 170 °C using the frequency sweep profile
detailed in Section 5.3.1. The samples were then cooled thereafter from 170 to 40 °C
at a rate of 50 °C/min, with a strain and angular frequency of
0.1 and 10 rad/s, respectively. Upon reaching 40 °C, the upper
geometry was programmed to rise at a constant rate of 0.1 mm/s while
recording the axial force. The torque was set to 0 μN m during
the test.
