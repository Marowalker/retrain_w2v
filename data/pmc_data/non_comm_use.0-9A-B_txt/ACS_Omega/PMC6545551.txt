In vivo targeting and visualization
of cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1)
using multimodal positron emission tomography/computed tomography
imaging represents a unique opportunity for early detection and/or
therapeutic evaluation of ovarian cancer because overexpression of
COX-1 has been characterized as a pathologic hallmark of the initiation
and progression of this disease. The furanone core is a common building
block of many synthetic and natural products that exhibit a wide range
of biological activities. We hypothesize that furanone-based COX-1
inhibitors can be designed as imaging agents for the early detection,
delineation of tumor margin, and evaluation of treatment response
of ovarian cancer. We report the discovery of 3-(4-fluorophenyl)-5,5-dimethyl-4-(p-tolyl)furan-2(5H)-one (FDF), a furanone-based
novel COX-1-selective inhibitor that exhibits adequate in vivo stability,
plasma half-life, and pharmacokinetic properties for use as an imaging
agent. We describe a novel synthetic scheme in which a Lewis acid-catalyzed
nucleophilic aromatic deiodo[18F]fluorination reaction
is utilized for the radiosynthesis of [18F]FDF. [18F]FDF binds efficiently to COX-1 in vivo and enables sensitive detection
of ovarian cancer in subcutaneous and peritoneal xenograft models
in mice. These results provide the proof of principle for COX-1-targeted
imaging of ovarian cancer and identify [18F]FDF as a promising
lead compound for further preclinical and clinical development.

Introduction
Ovarian cancer is the
fifth most common cause of cancer death in
women in the United States1 due in large
part to the fact that it is difficult to detect at an early stage.2 Thus, although treatment of epithelial ovarian
cancer has a high success rate if the disease is detected early,3 most women present with a pelvic mass reflecting
advanced disease that is associated with a poor prognosis.4 Better imaging modalities are surely needed for
early detection,5 presurgical evaluation,6 and therapeutic monitoring of ovarian cancer
in patients.7 To meet these needs, [18F]FDG-positron emission tomography (PET) has been evaluated
for the diagnosis and treatment of ovarian cancer in a number of clinical
studies,8 but it has not demonstrated adequate
specificity or sensitivity.9 [18F]FDG-PET combined with computerized tomography (CT) ([18F]FDG-PET/CT) exhibits greater specificity but still lacks adequate
sensitivity.10 Other PET molecular imaging
agents have shown some promise in animal models of ovarian cancer,
but none has yet progressed to the clinic.11−13 Clearly, the
availability of a targeted 18F-labeled PET imaging agent
that is effective for early diagnosis of ovarian cancer would be a
major advance in the fight against this disease.14

Emerging preclinical and clinical evidence suggests
that the enzyme
cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) is an important contributor to the early
growth of ovarian cancer.15−17 This characteristic distinguishes
ovarian cancer from most other malignancies, in which the second cyclooxygenase
isoform, COX-2, is expressed early in tumorigenesis and helps to drive
disease progression.18 COX-1 and COX-2
catalyze the rate-limiting step in prostaglandin (PG) and thromboxane
(TX) biosynthesis—the oxygenation of polyunsaturated fatty
acids to PG endoperoxides.19 PGs and TX
contribute to tumor cell proliferation, resistance to apoptosis, migration,
and angiogenesis.20 COX-1 and COX-2 are
the primary targets of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs),
which may account for the ability of NSAIDs to slow the progression
of many forms of cancer.21 The exact role
of COX-1 in ovarian cancer pathogenesis remains to be determined;
however, its unique pattern of expression in ovarian malignancies
leads to the hypothesis that COX-1 can serve as a novel target for
molecular imaging probes to be used for early detection, presurgical
evaluation, and monitoring the response to treatment of this elusive
disease.22 To test this hypothesis, we
developed a radiofluorinated analog of P6 (Figure 1a), a known COX-1-selective inhibitor (COX-1
IC50 = 1.9 μM, COX-2 IC50 > 4 μM).
In mice, distribution data showed higher [18F]P6 uptake
in human OVCAR3 ovarian cancer xenografts than in the surrounding
leg muscle, but the amount of radioactivity in the tumor was not sufficient
to enable micro-PET/CT visualization.23 This result suggested that it is possible to develop a COX-1-targeted
PET agent, but that a successful compound should be at least 10-fold
more effective than [18F]P6 as a COX-1 inhibitor. Also,
in contrast to [18F]P6, in which 18F was incorporated
as a fluoromethyl group, the ideal COX-1-targeted agent should contain 18F in a metabolically stable position (e.g., on an aromatic
ring).

Herein, we report the
discovery of 3-(4-fluorophenyl)-5,5-dimethyl-4-(p-tolyl)furan-2(5H)-one (FDF), a COX-1-selective
inhibitor optimized from a series of furanone-based biologically active
organic compounds, and we provide a novel acid-catalyzed iodonium
chemistry scheme for its radiofluorination. We describe the utility
and validation of [18F]FDF in COX-1-targeted imaging of
ovarian cancer in mouse models of subcutaneous and peritoneal tumors
by PET/CT.

Results
Chemical Synthesis
The majority
of both COX-1- and
COX-2-selective inhibitors has been based on a diarylheterocycle scaffold
(Figure 1a). Our first
attempt to discover fluorinated COX-1-selective inhibitors with higher
potency than 18F-P6 resulted in VU0487836, based on the
furanone scaffold of the diarylheterocycle, rofecoxib. Attempts to
incorporate 18F into this molecule under conditions typically
used for radiosynthesis failed, however, presumably because of the
instability of the furanone ring. We hypothesized that incorporation
of a 5,5-dimethyl group into the furanone ring would stabilize the
molecule. Thus, we developed a synthetic scheme for analogs of VU0487836
bearing this substituent beginning with the synthesis of arylalkyl
ketones (d,e) using a Friedel–Crafts
acylation reaction between substituted-arenes (a,b) and acyl chloride (c) (Figure 1b). In this electrophilic aromatic substitution
reaction, a stoichiometric amount of a Lewis acid catalyst, AlCl3, was used to prevent a second substitution on the aromatic
rings. The α-hydroxylation of ketones (d,e) was carried out in an immiscible heterogeneous system containing
NaOH, alkylaryl-ketones, and Aliquat 336, a lipophilic quaternary
ammonium salt as a phase-transfer catalyst. Aliquat 336 was utilized
to extract and transfer OH– anions to the organic
phase of the biphasic system for efficient reaction to afford hydroxy
ketones (f,g). A one-pot procedure was employed
for the synthesis of 5,5-dimethyl-furanones (1–6). First, substituted-phenylacetic acids were reacted with hydroxyl
compounds to generate the corresponding esters in situ. The esters
were then cyclized intramolecularly in the presence of 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene
(DBU) to afford the furanone products 1–6. The
iodo-compound 6 was treated with anisole in the presence
of m-chloroperbenzoic acid (m-CPBA)
and p-toluenesulfonic acid to afford compound 7 (Figure 1b).

Inhibition of Purified Cyclooxygenases
Inhibition of
purified ovine COX-1 or mouse COX-2 by test compounds 1–7 was assessed using a previously described method24 that quantifies the conversion of [1-14C]arachidonic
acid to [1-14C]PG products. The IC50 values
for inhibition of purified human COX-2 or ovine COX-1 by test compounds
(1–7) are summarized in Table 1. 5,5-Dimethyl-3,4-diphenylfuranone (1) displayed selective COX-1 inhibition with no inhibition
of COX-2 at concentrations up to 25 μM. Incorporation of a methyl
group at the para-position of the C-4 phenyl ring led to compound 2, which exhibited a significant increase in potency with
retained selectivity against COX-1. As a fluoro-functionality is required
for 18F-PET imaging, compounds 3, 4, and 5 were synthesized. Of the three, compound 5 was the most potent, but also the least selective. Compound 4 (FDF) exhibited the best combination of potency and selectivity
(Figure 1c). Replacement
of the fluoro-group of FDF by an iodo substituent afforded 6, which retained potent and selective COX-1 inhibition. Compound 7, an iodonium tosylate salt required as a radiofluorination
precursor, failed to inhibit either of the COX isoforms.

Furanone Derivatives 1–7 and Rofecoxib
Levels of Cyclooxygenases
in Cells
We and others previously
reported that the SKOV3/COX-1 human ovarian adenocarcinoma cell line
expresses high levels of COX-1 but does not express COX-2, whereas
SKOV3/pcDNA cells do not express any of the COX isozymes.22,25,26 Here, we evaluated the expression
of both COX-1 and COX-2 in the SKOV3, and OVCAR3 ovarian cancer cell
lines by western blot analysis using commercially available specific
antibodies. Purified COX-1 and COX-2 served as standards, and actin
was used as a loading control. The data revealed that COX-1 was expressed
strongly in OVCAR3 cells and weakly in SKOV3 cells, and none of these
cell lines expresses COX-2 enzyme (Figure 1d). Thus, these cells including SKOV3/COX-1,
1483 HNSCC, and SKOV3/pcDNA should be useful to evaluate the selectivity
and potency of compounds 1–7 in the cellular and/or
in vivo settings.

Inhibition of Cyclooxygenases in Cells
We evaluated
the ability of compounds 1–7 to inhibit COX-1
in intact OVCAR3 cells and COX-2 in 1483 HNSCC cells (data for FDF
are shown in Figure 1e).24 Compounds 1–6 all exhibited potent and selective COX-1 inhibition in these assays,
whereas compound 7 was inactive (Table 1). Because of its combined potency and selectivity
in both the purified protein and cell-based assays, we considered
FDF to be the most promising compound in the series.

Optimization
by Radiomimetic Chemistry
To optimize
conditions for radiosynthesis of [18F]FDF, we first carried
out the planned reaction using 19F-containing reagents.
We synthesized the iodonium precursor by reacting its iodo-derivative
(7) with anisole in the presence of m-chloroperoxybenzoic acid (m-CPBA) and p-toluenesulfonic acid. This procedure was robust and high-yielding.
For incorporation of 19F-fluorine, we initially reacted
the iodonium salt with [19F]tetrabutylammonium fluoride
(TBAF)/dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) at 80 °C for 30 min. This route
occasionally afforded the desired [19F]FDF, but with very
low yields (∼1%). The failure led us to investigate a number
of alternative approaches, including K19F/Kryptofix2.2.2/Cs2CO3/N,N-dimethylformamide
(DMF) at 80 °C for 10 min, K19F/Kryptofix2.2.2/K2CO3/2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl (TEMPO)/DMF
at 110 °C for 30 min, or [19F]KF/Kryptofix2.2.2/TEMPO/CH3CN at 80 °C for 10 min. Unfortunately, none of these
reactions afforded the desired [19F]FDF product. Then,
we reacted the iodonium salt with [19F]TBAF/DMSO in the
presence of m-CPBA for 30 min at 80 °C, which
afforded [19F]FDF in 33% yield (Figure 2a). We evaluated the effect of temperature
on this reaction over a range of 50–160 °C, and we obtained
the maximum [19F]FDF yield at 80–100 °C (Figure 2b). We confirmed
the incorporation of 19F-fluoride by fluorine nuclear magnetic
resonance (NMR) (Figure 2c) and high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) analysis (Figure 2d).

Radiochemistry
We treated tetrabutylammonium
bicarbonate
with 18F– to generate tetrabutylammonium 18F-fluoride, which was then reacted with compound 7 in DMSO in the presence of m-CPBA. The reaction
was stirred at 80 °C for 30 min (Figure 2a,g). This scheme afforded an overall 7.4%
decay-corrected radiochemical yield of [18F]FDF [n = 14 batches, average production 88.4 mCi/batch (3.27
GBq/batch), and 578.8 Ci/mmol (21 415.6 GBq/mmol) molar activity
(specific activity) with 99.9% radiochemical purity, overall synthesis
time 51 min]. Figure 2e shows the high-performance liquid chromatography-ultraviolet (HPLC-UV)
chromatogram, and Figure 2f shows the HPLC-gamma chromatogram of [18F]FDF
from a typical radiochemical reaction. Thus, inclusion of the 5,5-dimethyl
substituent on the furanone ring was a successful strategy to improve
compound stability to the point that it could tolerate the harsh radiosynthetic
conditions.

Pharmacokinetics of FDF
The plasma
protein binding
of FDF was determined in vitro for mouse, dog, and human. Binding
was approximately 99% in dog and human plasma, and 97.5% in mouse
plasma. Thus, FDF is highly bound to plasma proteins across species
with free fractions of about 0.99–2.5% of the total plasma
FDF concentration (Figure 1f). The plasma half-life of FDF in CD-1 mice was 1.2 h (Figure 3a). Biodistribution
analysis showed a significantly higher uptake of FDF in the kidney
(average 8.87 nmol/g tissue) than the liver (overall average 0.61
nmol/g tissue) or other organs (Figure 3b). The very low levels of uptake in the lung, heart,
liver, brain, and muscle suggest that FDF exhibits very low affinity
for these organs, and high kidney uptake may be attributable to renal
clearance. Also, we analyzed the tissues to evaluate the potential
of FDF for defluorination in vivo. The defluorinated metabolite was
reliably detected in kidneys (0.01 nmol/g tissue), but levels were
below the quantification limit in other organs, suggesting minimal
de-fluorination of FDF.

Human Ovarian Cancer Xenograft Model
We have developed
a dual human tumor xenograft model that enables evaluation of [18F]FDF radiotracer uptake by a high COX-1-expressing and a
low COX-1-expressing tumor simultaneously in a single animal. We have
optimized reproducibility in this model by using the SKOV3 ovarian
cancer cell line transfected with the empty vector (SKOV3/pcDNA),
which naturally expresses quite low levels of COX-1, and SKOV3 cells
transfected with the COX-1 gene (SKOV3/COX-1), which express high
levels of COX-1. The transfection of the COX-1 gene into the parental
SKOV3 cell line results in stable protein expression levels similar
to those in the naturally expressing OVCAR-3 ovarian cancer cell line
(Figure 1d). The SKOV3/COX-1
and SKOV3/pcDNA cells were chosen over the OVCAR3 line because tumor
xenografts from OVCAR3 cells grow extremely slowly.

To confirm
the differential expression of COX-1 in vivo, we determined the level
of PGs and TXs in tumor xenografts derived from SKOV3/pcDNA and SKOV3/COX-1
cells. Concentrations of PGs and TX in SKOV3/COX-1 tumors were nearly
fourfold greater than those in SKOV3/pcDNA tumors (Figure 3c). It is noteworthy that SKOV3/pcDNA
and SKOV3/COX-1 cells do not express COX-2.

In Vivo PET/CT Imaging
of COX-1 in Ovarian Tumors
We
evaluated [18F]FDF as a COX-1-targeted PET imaging agent
in two preclinical mouse models of ovarian cancer. The first included
the use of subcutaneous human cell line xenograft tumors to validate
target specificity of [18F]FDF. The second strategy utilized
an intraperitoneal (i.p.) mouse model of ovarian cancer that is more
physiologically relevant to human ovarian cancer.

In the first
set of experiments, subcutaneous xenograft tumors derived from SKOV3/COX-1
and SKOV3/pcDNA cells were established on the left and right hind
flanks, respectively, of female athymic nude mice. The tumor xenografts
were allowed to grow to approximately 750–1000 mm3. To determine the time-point at which maximal tumor uptake occurs,
we performed a 1.5 h dynamic PET scan initiated with [18F]FDF i.p. injection. The resulting time–activity curve showed
a maximal tumor uptake of [18F]FDF at around 1 h post injection
with a fourfold increased uptake by the tumor compared to muscle tissues
(Figure 3d). For in
vivo PET/CT imaging of tumors, we administered [18F]FDF
to tumor-bearing mice at a dose range of 400–700 μCi
(0.0148–0.0259 GBq) per mouse (i.p. injection). Following 1
h, the animals were placed in a micro-PET/CT Focus 220 for imaging.
The results demonstrated that [18F]FDF accumulated in the
high COX-1-expressing SKOV3/COX-1 xenografts to greater levels (Figures 3e and S30) than in the low COX-1-expressing SKOV3/pcDNA
xenografts (Figure 3f). The PET images were analyzed using AMIDE software and corrected
for injected dose and body weight. Three-dimensional regions of interest
(ROI) were drawn around the tumors and surrounding normal tissues
separately. Figure 3g shows the quantitative representation of uptake of [18F]FDF into the SKOV3/COX-1 and SKOV3/pcDNA tumors as compared to
[18F]FDF uptake in the leg muscle. Over the group of animals
imaged, tracer accumulation in the high COX-1-expressing tumor xenograft
ROI (mean ± sd = 1.4 ± 1.3, p = 0.043, n = 5) was three- to sixfold greater than that in the muscle
ROI (mean ± sd = 0.24 ± 0.2, n = 5), and
tracer accumulation in the low COX-1-expressing tumor xenograft ROI
(mean ± sd = 0.84 ± 0.64, p = 0.033, n = 5) was two2- to threefold greater than that in the muscle
ROI (mean ± sd = 0.24 ± 0.20, n = 5), consistent
with the differential levels of COX-1 expression.

To evaluate
the ability of [18F]FDF to target ovarian
cancer under more physiologically relevant conditions, we used a SKOV3/COX-1
peritoneal tumor model. In this model, SKOV3/COX-1 cells [1 ×
107 in 200 μL sterile phosphate buffered saline (PBS)]
were injected intraperitoneally into 6-week-old female nude mice,
and the tumors were allowed to grow for a period of up to 3 months.
Imaging commenced at the first sign of ascites. Dynamic scanning over
0–9 min revealed that the time-point of maximal [18F]FDF uptake in the peritoneal tumors was ∼5 min (Figure 4a). For in vivo tumor
imaging, the animals were dosed with 500–650 μCi (0.0185–0.0241
GBq) [18F]FDF (50 μL, retro-orbitally) and imaged
in the Inveon micro-PET/CT (Siemens) at 5 min postinjection of the
radiotracer. As a contrast agent for CT, ioversol injection Optiray
320 was dosed (200 μL, intraperitoneally) 10 min prior to [18F]FDF. In this model, tumors form throughout the peritoneal
cavity with varying sizes and shapes, making their identification
by PET/CT much more challenging than in the subcutaneous xenograft
model. However, we were able to correctly visualize multiple peritoneal
tumors in each animal by [18F]FDF/PET (Figures 4b,c and S31). The normalized tumor uptake (mean ± sd = 25 ±
6, p < 0.0004, n = 6) was approximately
fivefold higher than the uptake in normal muscle tissues (Figure 4d, mean ± sd
= 3.4 ± 0.9, n = 6). These results demonstrate
that signals from [18F]FDF can distinguish a COX-1-expressing
tumor in the low background of COX-1 expression in the peritoneal
cavity, a key requirement for its use in the imaging of ovarian cancer
in clinical settings.

Discussion
The diarylheterocyclic scaffolds yielded
the highest number of
potent and selective COX-2 inhibitors, such as celecoxib, rofecoxib,
and valdecoxib (Figure 1a).27 The key determinant of the COX-2
selectivity of these compounds is the presence on one of the aromatic
rings of a sulfonamide or a methylsulfone that inserts into a side-pocket
in the cyclooxygenase active site that is only accessible in COX-2.28,29 Thus, the COX-1-selective inhibitor SC-560, a diarylpyrazole analog,
was discovered via the deletion of the sulfonamide group from celecoxib.30 SC-560 has been extensively used as an in vivo
probe for COX-1’s involvement in biological responses;31,32 however, when [11C]SC-560 was synthesized for PET imaging,
COX-1-dependent accumulation in tissues could not be demonstrated.33 This failure is likely because SC-560 has not
been optimized for in vivo activity and suffers from multiple liabilities,
including poor solubility and pyrazole-associated off-target effects.34,35 The diarylfuranone scaffold that yielded rofecoxib appears more
promising as a starting point for the synthesis of a COX-1-selective
inhibitor. Rofecoxib’s aqueous solubility is higher, and it
has been associated with fewer off-target effects than celecoxib.35 In general, the clog Ps of
simple diarylfuranones (1.8–3.0) promise a reasonably higher
level of water solubility than those of many typical drug-like scaffolds
that have been used for the synthesis of COX-2 inhibitors.

The
key functional group for the COX-2-selectivity of rofecoxib
is the sulfonylmethyl group on the C-4 aromatic ring.29 Consistently, we previously demonstrated that removal of
this group reverses the selectivity of the molecule from COX-2 to
COX-1. Although the resulting 3,4-diphenylfuranone is a weak COX-1-selective
inhibitor (IC50 = 5.9 μM)36 it served as a promising scaffold for optimization by functionalization,
leading to the discovery of VU0487836 (Figure 1a).36 To enable
its use as a PET imaging agent, VU0487836 was constructed with a metabolically
stable fluorine atom that could be readily incorporated as 18F radioactive fluorine at a late stage in synthesis. However, after
multiple attempts to incorporate 18F into this molecule
failed, we hypothesized that VU0487836’s γ-lactone ring
is unstable under the highly basic (pH ≈ 11) radiomimetic conditions.
Thus, as described here, we developed the synthetic procedures and
performed the additional structure–activity optimization required
to obtain COX-1-selective inhibitors that include a furanone ring-stabilizing
5,5-dimethyl substituent. This effort led to the discovery of FDF.

Despite the addition of the 5,5-dimethyl group, we found that commonly
used techniques37−39 were extremely limited for the nucleophilic aromatic
deiodofluorination reaction required to synthesize [18F]FDF.
We hypothesize that the failure of these nucleophilic aromatic substitutions
is due to the presence of the strongly electron-withdrawing furanone
nucleus that induces nucleophilic fluorination of the hypervalent
iodine. To stabilize the newly created inner-halogen bond, it is possible
that a lone pair of electrons of the hypervalent iodine delocalizes
to create a quinone-like inner-halogen intermediate that is incapable
of conversion into [18F]FDF. To address this problem, we
first treated the iodonium salt with TBAF in the presence of m-CPBA as a catalyst. Interestingly, this reaction afforded
the desired 19F-product (36% yield). To investigate whether
this is an oxidation phenomenon, we replaced m-CPBA
with oxone or potassium peroxodisulfate. No [19F]FDF was
identified in the reaction mixture, suggesting that m-CPBA was not acting as an oxidizing agent in this reaction. To uncover m-CPBA’s mechanism of action, we utilized a Lewis
acid, m-chlorobenzoic acid (m-CBA),
in its place. This reaction afforded [19F]FDF in 33% yield,
suggesting that m-CPBA reacts in situ with solvent
DMSO to form m-CBA, which then catalyzed the reaction
to form the [19F]FDF product. Later, we replaced m-CBA with HCl and found that it also successfully produced
[19F]FDF (∼30% yield). The strong electrophilic
nature of iodine is the basis for the hypervalent iodine chemistry
that creates a position in the molecule that is susceptible to nucleophilic
attack. Thus, iodonium salts have been designated a hyperleaving group.
We propose that the Lewis acid inhibits the delocalization of the
lone pair of electrons of the hypervalent iodine. This favors the
formation the transition state (Figure 2g) of the reductive elimination that is key to the
reaction of hypervalent iodine, thereby forming the [18F]FDF product. It is likely that electron-trapping by the Lewis acid
disfavors the formation of the inactive quinone-like intermediate
that inhibits the reductive elimination of hypervalent iodine.

Our experiments demonstrate the successful development of a furanone-based
COX-1-targeted in vivo PET/CT imaging probe for ovarian cancer. 18F-FDF displays targeted uptake in two distinct animal models
of ovarian cancer, demonstrating the selectivity for ovarian cancer
xenografts expressing high levels of COX-1 compared to those that
express low levels COX-1 or surrounding tissue. It should be noted
that the uptake into subcutaneous ovarian tumors was slower than into
peritoneal tumors as demonstrated by quantitative analysis of tumor
biodistribution of 18F-FDF in vivo. This difference might
be because the subcutaneous tumors are less vascularized than the
peritoneal tumors, which are physiologically more relevant to human
ovarian cancer.

To achieve this success, we developed a simple
one-pot procedure
for the chemical synthesis of fluorine-containing furanone derivatives
and evaluated them as COX-1-targeted PET/CT imaging agents. Although
a vast majority of these compounds were selective against both purified
COX-1 protein and COX-1 activity in intact cancer cells, only FDF
exhibited adequate stability during radio[18F]fluorination,
reasonably long in vivo plasma half-life, sufficient metabolic stability
in the circulation, and acceptable plasma protein binding characteristics.
[18F]FDF showed efficient COX-1-dependent uptake and enrichment
to result in a detectable level of concentration in tumor tissues.
These experiments confirm [18F]FDF’s utility in
COX-1-targeted in vivo PET/CT imaging of xenograft tumors of ovarian
cancer in rodents. These in vivo results suggest that the binding
of [18F]FDF with COX-1 is the major determinant of its
tumor uptake and support the conclusion that [18F]FDF-PET
is a feasible imaging approach for visualization of ovarian tumors
expressing elevated levels of COX-1 in preclinical and clinical settings.

Conclusions
We report the discovery of FDF, a furanone-based COX-1-targeted
agent. Selective COX-1 binding of FDF and inhibition were confirmed
in assays using purified enzyme and in ovarian cancer cells expressing
elevated labels of COX-1. FDF does not bind with COX-2 in any of these
settings. FDF exhibits adequate metabolic stability, protein binding,
and plasma half-life to enable its use for in vivo imaging. As the
radiosyntheses of furanone-based radiopharmaceuiticals are extremely
rare, we developed an iodonium-based method for radiolabeling of FDF
involving a novel Lewis acid-catalyzed nucleophilic aromatic deiodo[18F]fluorination reaction. We report the application of [18F]FDF in the detection of COX-1 in mouse models of ovarian
cancer, including both subcutaneous and i.p. human tumor xenografts.
In vivo uptake of [18F]FDF was selective for COX-1 overexpressing
tumors over normal tissues. [18F]FDF represents the first
feasible radiotracer validated for targeted PET/CT imaging of neoplastic
tissues expressing elevated levels of the COX-1 isozyme.

We purchased compounds a–c from Sigma-Aldrich, synthesized d–g using literature methods,40−42 and developed synthetic methods
for 1–7. Spectra and chromatograms of all new
compounds are listed in the Supporting Information.

Solvents and Reagents
ACS grade reagents and anhydrous
solvents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, Fisher, or VWR Chemical
Companies, and used without further purification.

Chromatography
Plastic-backed microplates were used
for analytical silica gel thin-layer chromatography (TLC) of crude
reaction mixtures. An ultraviolet illuminator at 254–365 nm
wavelength was used for spot visualization. Flash or gravity column
chromatography was performed using standard grade silica gel from
Sorbent Technologies.

HPLC Conditions
Waters HPLC system
with a photometric
diode array detector (at 254 nm wavelength) was used for determination
of purity of the final compounds. The instrument was equipped with
a Supelco Supelcosil C-18 reverse-phase column (15 cm Å—3
mm, 5 μm) using the following chromatographic conditions: component
A—H2O with 5 mM octanesulfonic acid (pH ≈
3) and component B—acetonitrile with 10% component A gradient:
40% B to 90% B in 9.5 min followed by 5.5 min hold at 90% B, flow:
1.0 mL/min, column: Supelco C18 25 × 0.46 cm, 5 μm, held
at 40 °C.

Nuclear Magnetic Resonance
A Bruker
AV-I console operating
at 600 MHz was used for 1H NMR and 1H correlation
spectroscopy experiments of all new compounds. A 9.4 T Oxford magnet
was equipped with the Bruker AV-I instrument in which the following
experimental conditions were applied: data matrix—2048 ×
512, sweep width—13 ppm, recycle delay—1.5 s, and scans
per increment—4. We processed the acquired data using a squared
sine-bell window function, which were symmetrized, and displayed in
magnitude mode. A Bruker DRX console operating at 150 MHz, equipped
with an 11.7 T Oxford magnet, was used for 13C, heteronuclear
single quantum coherence, and heteronuclear multiple bond correlation
NMR experiments.

Anhydrous dichloromethane (50 mL) was added to a mixture of substituted
hydroxy ketone (5 mmol), substituted-phenylacetic acid (5.2 mmol), N-cyclohexyl-N′-(2-morpholinoethyl)carbodiimide
methyl-p-toluenesulfonate (CMC, 5.2 mmol), and N,N-dimethylaminopyridine (2.6 mmol). After

mixture, which was then refluxed (40–45 °C) for 3 h. The
reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature, water (40 mL) was
added to quench the reaction, and the mixture was then extracted with
dichloromethane (3 × 100 mL). The combined organic layers were

(4-(5,5-Dimethyl-2-oxo-4-(p-tolyl)-2,5-dihydrofuran-3-yl)phenyl)(4-methoxyphenyl)iodonium
Tosylate, 7
A solution of 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol
(2.5 mL) in anhydrous dichloromethane (2.5 mL) was added to a mixture
of compound 6 (0.5 g, 1.2 mmol), 3-chloroperbenzoic acid

solvent was evaporated in vacuo, and the resultant residue was chromatographed
on silica gel. The column was first washed with n-hexane/EtOAc (4:1) to remove impurities, and the product was then
eluted with CHCl3/MeOH/NH4OH (35:7:1). The solvent
was evaporated in vacuo to dryness. EtOAc (2 mL) was added to the
residue and mixed vigorously to afford the product in pure form as
a white solid, 0.57 g, 70% yield, melting point 238–240 °C. 1H NMR (600 MHz, DMSO-d6): δ

Radiosynthesis of [18F]FDF, [18F]4
In a typical reaction, a mixture 18F– fluoride 1194.6 mCi (44.2 GBq) in water
(1 mL) and
acetonitrile (2 mL) was added to a stirred aqueous tetrabutylammonium
bicarbonate (0.038 M, 1 mL) solution. The solvent was evaporated using
a stream of argon (6–10 psi, 15–25 mL/min) at 91 °C
and compete dryness was achieved by repetitive evaporation with acetonitrile
(3 × 200 μL). The dried [18F]-TBAF was dissolved
in anhydrous DMSO (0.5 mL) and was added to a solution of iodonium
precursor (7, 4 mg, 0.0065 mmol) and m-CPBA (1.3 mg, 0.0075 mmol) in DMSO (0.5 mL). The reaction mixture
was stirred at 80 °C for 30 min. A radio-HPLC was used for the
purification of [18F]-FDF [C18, 250 × 10, 8 μm,
EtOH/water (50:50), flow rate 5 mL/min, Rf 13.12 min]. The [18F]-FDF peak was collected, evaporated,
and the radiotracer was formulated using EtOH/saline, 1:9 v/v, 112
mCi (4.14 GBq), decay-corrected radiochemical yield
9.3%, radiochemical purity 99.9%, overall synthesis time 51
min).

Inhibition of Purified Cyclooxygenase Isozymes
We evaluated
the COX-1 and COX-2 inhibitory activities of test compounds 1–7 using a previously described radio-TLC assay.24

Western Blot Analysis
Cell lines
were grown in 100
mm plates (Sarstedt) to 50% confluence and were harvested by scraping
into PBS. The cells were centrifuged at 4 °C, 200g for 5 min. The pellets were resuspended in 200 μL of M-PER
(Pierce) and frozen at −80 °C. Cell lysates (20 μg)
or COX-1/-2 (5 ng, positive control) were loaded onto a 4–20%
10-well, 50 μL, Mini-PROTEAN TGX gel (Bio-Rad). Following electrophoresis
and transfer, the blot was incubated overnight with a murine monoclonal
antibody raised against human COX-1 or COX-2 (Santa Cruz) at 1:200
dilution. The presence of the antibody was detected by treatment with
IRDye 680LT donkey antimouse IgG (1:10 000, LI-COR).

Inhibition
of Cyclooxygenases in Cells
We evaluated
the ability of test compounds 1–7 to inhibit COX-1
and COX-2 in intact cells using a published procedure.24 Briefly, both OVACR3 cells and 1483 HNSCC cell
lines were plated in 6-well plates (Sarstedt) and grown to 60% confluence.
Serum-free medium (2 mL) was added per well with 0, 0.04, 0.2, 0.5,
1.0, and 5.0 μM final concentration of FDF for 30 min at 37
°C. The final concentration of DMSO was 0.5% in all wells. The
medium (1 mL) was removed, and [1-14C]-arachidonic acid
(57 mCi/mmol, 2.11 GBq/mmol, NEC661, PerkinElmer)
was added to provide a 4 μM final concentration. At the end
of the 30 min, 37 °C incubation, an aliquot of the medium (0.4
mL) was removed from each well and added to a 0.6 mL ice-cold termination
solution (Et2O/CH3OH, 1 mol/L citrate 30:4:1,
pH 4). The organic layer was spotted on 20 × 20 TLC plates, developed,
and quantitated on the Bioscan AR-2000 for the remaining arachidonic
acid substrate compared to the vehicle-only cells.

Plasma Protein
Binding
We evaluated the binding characteristics
of FDF to plasma proteins in vitro to identify its unbound free fractions.
We determined the percent of FDF bound to protein using a fast gradient
elution liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC–MS)/MS
at 0 and 4.5 h of incubation of the compound with the plasma from
mouse, human, and dog at 37 °C. The assay was performed using
a high-throughput dialysis micro-equilibrium device. The unbound fraction
was calculated by dividing the concentration of the buffer side by
the concentration of the protein side.43 Percent recovery was calculated by dividing the sum of the buffer
and protein chambers by the time of 0 concentration after 4.5 h.

Radiomimetic Chemistry
A solution of tretrabutyammonium 19F-fluoride (11 mg, 0.035 mmol) in anhydrous DMSO (0.5 mL)
was added to a solution of the iodonium precursor 7 (6
mg, 0.0084 mmol) and m-CPBA (1.6 mg, 0.0084 mmol)
in DMSO (0.5 mL). The reaction mixture was stirred for 30 min at 80
°C. After cooling to room temperature, the reaction mixture was
poured into a silica column and eluted with n-hexane/ethylacetate
(4:1) to afford the fluorinated product [19F]FDF (compound 4, 3.4 mg, 33% isolated yield, 99.9% HPLC purity, n = 12).

LC–MS/MS Analyses
All LC–MS/MS
analyses
were carried out on a Shimadzu LC system in-line with a SCIEX 3200
QTrap mass spectrometer. The 3200 QTrap was equipped with an electrospray
source and operated in positive ion mode.

Mice
We performed
all ex vivo and in vivo animal experiments
and ethical conducts according to the methods approved by the Vanderbilt
University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) and
the National Institute of Health (NIH) guidelines.

Plasma Concentrations
C57BL/6 mice (male, 25 g, Charles
River Labs) were dosed with FDF (10 mg/kg, i.p.). Following 0.5, 1,
2, or 4 h the mice (three per time point) were euthanized by lethal
anesthesia, and blood was collected by cardiac puncture. Blood was
drawn into heparinized 1 mL syringes with 22 g, 1 in needles, and
gently expelled into 1.5 mL tubes containing 10 μL of heparin
(on ice). After mixing, the tubes were centrifuged at 2300g for 5 min at 4 °C. The upper plasma layer was transferred
into fresh tubes for storage at −80 °C until processing.

FDF was extracted from plasma by liquid–liquid extraction,
and an internal standard (compound 5) was added to the
samples. Then, the samples were diluted with an equivalent of water
containing 1% acetic acid. After a 2× volume of ethyl acetate
was added, the samples were mixed well and centrifuged briefly to
promote phase separation. The upper ethyl acetate layer was removed
to clean the vessels and dried under nitrogen. Dried samples were
reconstituted in 1:1 water/methanol and analyzed via LC–MS/MS.
The analyte was chromatographed on a Phenomenex Lux Amylose column
(25 × 0.46 cm). The mobile phase was 1:1 water/acetonitrile (each
with 0.1% formic acid), and the flow rate was 1.0 mL/min. Mass spectrometric
detection of the analyte and internal standard (compound 5) was accomplished
via selected reaction monitoring (SRM). The SRM transition for both
was m/z 279 → 221, and the
samples were quantitated against a standard curve prepared in mouse
plasma, which was processed and analyzed alongside the unknown samples.

Biodistribution
To evaluate the biodistribution and
potential for defluorination, we analyzed the major organs of C57BL/6
mice injected with unlabeled FDF. C57BL/6 mice (male, 30 g, Charles
River Labs, three per group) were dosed with FDF (10 mg/kg, i.p.)
at 10 min intervals. Following 60 min, the mice were sacrificed by
anesthesia overdose followed by immediate removal of brain, lungs,
heart, kidney, liver, and muscle. Tissues were rinsed in cold PBS
and blotted, then placed into prelabeled foil squares between blocks
of dry ice. Organs and tissues were stored at −80 °C until
LC/MS–MS analysis.

For analysis, tissues were weighed
and then placed in 3 mL of acetonitrile in a Tenbroeck tissue grinder.
The tissues were pulverized via sonication and mechanical grinding.
The homogenate was removed to a clean vessel, and the Tenbroeck tissue
grinder was rinsed with 1 mL of acetonitrile, which was added to the
homogenate. The homogenate was stored overnight at −20 °C
and then centrifuged at 2060g at 4 °C for 10
min. The clear supernatant was removed to a clean test tube and dried
under nitrogen. The dried sample was reconstituted in 60 μL
of methanol followed by 60 μL of water. The reconstituted samples
were re-centrifuged to pellet out particulate matter and then analyzed
via LC–MS/MS.

The samples were chromatographed on a Phenomenex
C18 column (5
× 0.2 cm). The mobile phase components were water (A) and 1:1
methanol/acetonitrile (B), each containing 0.1% formic acid. A gradient
elution scheme was employed in which % B increased from 50 to 100%
over 3 min, and the flow rate was 0.32 mL/min. Analyte detection was
accomplished via SRM. The SRM transition m/z 279 → 236 was used for quantitation in conjunction
with a standard curve of samples prepared in 1:1 methanol/water and
interspersed with the tissue samples.

Subcutaneous Tumor Model
Subcutaneous xenograft tumors
derived from high COX-1-expressing human SKOV3/COX-1 cells and low
COX-1-expressing SKOV3/pcDNA cells (1 × 104 in 100
μL sterile PBS) were established on the left and right hind
flanks, respectively, of female athymic nude mice. The tumor xenografts
were allowed to grow to approximately 750–1000 mm3 to ensure that a vascular bed was established within the tumor.

Intraperitoneal Tumor Model
Intraperitoneal xenograft
tumors were derived from COX-1-expressing SKOV3/COX-1 cells (1 ×
107 in 200 μL sterile PBS) injected intraperitoneally
into 6-week-old female nude mice and allowed to grow for a period
of up to 3 months.

Tumor Analysis
Tumor tissue was
removed from −80
°C storage and weighed. Then, the tissue was transferred to a
Tenbroeck tissue grinder along with deuterated internal standards
of the five prostanoids of interest. The tissue was homogenized in
1:1 methanol/PBS, and the homogenate was stored at −20 °C
overnight. The homogenate was centrifuged at 1430g for 10 min at 4 °C and ∼75% of the clear supernatant
was partially dried under nitrogen to reduce the volume and remove
methanol. To the partially dried sample, a volume of 1% acetic acid
(roughly 5× the amount of homogenate remaining) was added, and
the sample was loaded onto a conditioned Phenomenex C18 solid phase
extraction cartridge (200 mg). After loading, the cartridge was rinsed
with 4 mL of 1% acetic acid, then with 4 mL of 1% acetic acid containing
14% methanol. Finally, the prostanoids were eluted with 3 mL methanol.
The eluent was dried under nitrogen and reconstituted in 70 μL
of methanol followed by 70 μL of water. The reconstituted samples
were analyzed via LC–MS/MS as previously described.

Statistical
Analysis
The experimental treatment groups
were compared using Student’s t-test at a
statistical significance level of <0.05. When comparing two data
replicates the GraphPad Prism and Microsoft Excel were used for analyses
to obtain data as mean ± standard deviation of the indicated
sample size (n) unless stated otherwise.
