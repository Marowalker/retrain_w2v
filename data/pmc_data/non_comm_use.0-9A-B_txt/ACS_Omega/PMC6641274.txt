CoP was synthesized in situ on the
surface of CdS nanowires using
a cobalt–ammine complex as a precursor. The generated CoP@CdS
photocatalyst was well characterized by X-ray diffraction, transmission
electron microscopy, selected-area electron diffraction, and diffuse
reflectance spectra. A more efficient charge transfer was successfully
achieved owing to the close contact between CoP and CdS. The hybrid
photocatalyst showed excellent activity for the reduction of nitroarenes
to the corresponding anilines or azobenzene compounds in water. In
present work, hydrogen evolution and nitro reduction were concurrent
and with the consumption of substrate, the rate of hydrogen evolution
increased. The driving force for the reduction originated from the
activated hydrogen species in the photocatalytic reaction rather than
from dihydrogen. The photocatalytic activity of as-prepared CoP@CdS
in situ is comparable to that of the catalysts formed using a noble
metal loaded onto CdS. Mechanistic investigation showed that the condensation
route is the major pathway for nitro reduction in the present system,
and azo compounds could be obtained with less irradiation time, while
aniline will be obtained via long-time irradiation.

1 Introduction
Heterocatalysis,
especially photocatalysis, with semiconducting
materials has attracted considerable attention. However, most of the
research on photocatalysis is largely concentrated on the photocatalytic
splitting of water to H2 and O2 or the decomposition
of organic pollutants to H2O and CO2 without
selectivity.1−7 Nevertheless, it is a challenge to utilize semiconductor-based photocatalysts
for organic transformation. The rational application of suitable semiconductor
catalysts and the control of the reaction conditions can promote the
conversion of reactants into target products.8 The reduction of nitroaromatics is one of the most important reactions
in organic synthesis and industrial production.9,10 The
traditional method involves the hydrogenation of a nitro group, which
needs high temperature and high hydrogen gas pressure with noble metal
catalysts such as Au, Pd, and Pt.

Visible-light-driven reduction
of nitroaromatics has been regarded
as a crucial industrially relevant strategy to solve the energy crisis
and environmental pollution problems. Since Fujishima and Honda found
that TiO2 could split water into H2 and O2, photocatalysis has received increasing attention.11 TiO2-based materials have been some
of the most widely researched semiconductors for photocatalysis. TiO2, which was used to reduce a nitro group under ultraviolet
(UV) light, has also been reported.12−14 However, UV light accounts
for only 4% of natural light, which restricts the practical application
of the reaction. Some photocatalytic systems have been designed to
overcome the shortcomings of TiO2. Ruthenium dye-sensitized
and quantum dot-sensitized TiO2 have shown enhanced activity
when irradiated by visible light.15−17 Pd and Ag/Au cocatalysts
combined with TiO2 were more active for the photocatalytic
reduction of nitrobenzene.18,19 Besides TiO2, Pd/Si, Ag/Bi2MoO6, PbBiO2X, and
CdS have also been used for hydrogenation of the nitro group.20−24 A Pt-deposited Ti(IV) metal-organic framework has been reported
for nitro reduction reactions with an initial reaction rate of 132
μmol h–1 g–1.25 Weiss et al. have reported that electron transfer,
not proton transfer, is the rate-limiting step for nitrobenzene reduction.26 Guo et al. used Cu on graphene as a catalyst
for the controlled catalysis of the reduction of aromatic nitro compounds
to azo compounds.27

2 Experimental
Section
2.1 Materials
All chemicals were of analytical
grade and used as received without further purification. Co(OAc)2·4H2O, NaH2PO2, ethylene
diamine, and sodium diethyldithiocarbamate trihydrate (C5H10NNaS2·3H2O) were obtained
from Aladdin Industrial Inc. CdCl2·2.5H2O and NH3·H2O were purchased from Sinopharm
Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd.

2.2 Preparation of CdS Nanowires
(CdSnw’s)
CdS nanowires (CdSnw’s) were synthesized
via a modified
method. In a typical procedure, 627.6 mg of CdCl2·2.5H2O and 1238.3 mg of sodium diethyldithiocarbamate trihydrate
(C5H10NNaS2·3H2O)
were added into 3 mL of deionized water and subsequently the mixture
was treated by ultrasonic wave for 20 min. Cadmium diethyldithiocarbamate
(Cd(S2CNEt2)2) was obtained, and
then 40 mL of ethylene diamine was filled into a 100 mL autoclave.
The autoclave was maintained at 180 °C for 24 h and then cooled
to room temperature. A yellow precipitate was collected and washed
with ethanol, and the final products were dried in an oven at 60 °C
overnight.

2.3 Preparation of CoP@CdS
In the first
step, 600 mg of as-prepared CdSnw’s was added to a 250 mL eggplant-shaped
bottle, followed by the addition of 24 mL of ethanol and 0.5 mL of
deionized water. The mixture was ultrasound for 30 min at room temperature,
and then 0.6 mL of Co(OAc)2·4H2O (87.2
mg) aqueous solution was dropwise added into the mixture, followed
by 0.5 mL of NH3·H2O. After 30 min of stirring,
95 mL of ethanol was poured into the bottle and stirred for another
30 min. The obtained suspension was heated to 80 °C for 22 h.
Then, the suspension was transferred into a 100 mL autoclave of 80%
capacity and heated to 150 °C for 3 h. A brown-yellow product
(Co3O4@CdS) was collected by centrifugation
and washed with ethanol three times. In the second step, 281 mg of
NaH2PO2 was placed at the upstream of a quartz
boat and the dried Co3O4@CdS was placed at the
downstream of the boat with a distance of 4 cm. Afterward, the boat
was directly heated to 300 °C for 2 h under an Ar atmosphere
in a tube furnace. Subsequently, after cooling to room temperature
naturally in continued Ar flow, the obtained brown solid (CoP@CdS(5%))
was washed with water and ethanol several times and dried in a vacuum
oven. The weight percentages of CoP (theoretical value) in the various
composites produced were 1, 2.5, and 7.5, and pure CoP nanoparticles
were also synthesized without CdSnw’s by a similar method.

2.4 Characterization
The samples were
characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) on a Bruker AXS D8
X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα (λ = 1.54056 Å) to
identify their phases. The particle size and lattice fringes of the
samples were analyzed on a transmission electron microscope (TEM;
JEM 2100F) with an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. UV–vis diffuse
reflectance spectra (DRS) were recorded on a spectrophotometer (Varian
Cary 5000) using BaSO4 as a reference. The chemical structure
and quantity of the products were determined by 1H nuclear
magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy (Bruker Avance 400 spectrometer).
The produced hydrogen was measured by a gas chromatograph (GC-2014C,
Shimadzu, with argon as a carrier gas) with a 5 Å molecular sieve
column (3 × 2 m2) and a thermal-conductivity detector.
Thermogravimetric analysis was performed on a TA Instrument Q600 SDT
from room temperature to 500 °C.

2.5 Photoelectrochemical
Measurements
Photocurrent measurements were conducted on
a CHI 660e electrochemical
workstation (Chenhua Instrument, China) using a conventional three-electrode
configuration. A catalyst electrode served as the working electrode,
with a platinum foil as the counter electrode and an Ag/AgCl (saturated
KCl) electrode as the reference electrode. Then, 0.2 M Na2SO4 aqueous solution was used as the electrolyte, through
which nitrogen was bubbled for 20 min prior to measurement. The white
light-emitting diode (LED) (30 × 3 W, λ ≥ 420 nm)
light source was used for irradiation. The working electrodes were
prepared as follows: 3 mg of sample was dispersed in 40 μL of
isopropanol with 5 μL of Nafion by sonication for 20 min. The
slurry was then evenly spread onto a 3.0 × 1.0 cm2 conducting indium tin oxide (ITO) glass substrate with an active
area of about 1.0 cm2. The film was dried in air. The photoresponses
of the samples at light on and off were measured at 0.1 V.

2.6 Photocatalytic Test
Typically, 5
mL of water containing 0.1 mmol of substrate, 2 mmol of HCOONH4, and 4 mg of the CoP@CdS photocatalyst was added to a 15
mL cuvette sealed with a rubber septum placed on top of a magnetic
stirrer. A stream of Ar was then passed into the reaction system for
10 min. White light-emitting diodes (LEDs) (30 × 3 W, λ
≥ 420 nm) were used as the irradiation light source. The LEDs
were positioned 3 cm away from the sample, which was kept under continuous
stirring at room temperature. The mixture was stirred for 10 min before
irradiation.

In the cycling tests, the used photocatalyst was
recycled by centrifugation, washed with ethanol and deionized water,
and dried at 60 °C in a vacuum oven. Dichloromethane was used
as the extraction agent and extracted three times in a row.

3 Results and Discussion
One-dimensional semiconducting
materials, such as CdS nanowires,
have drawn widespread attention because of their inherent structure,
a large surface area with a high length-to-diameter ratio, which can
reduce the transportation distance of photoinduced charge carriers
as well as reduce the defects and impurities in CdS nanocrystals.28 However, their photocorrosion is a major drawback.
A cocatalyst can improve the photogenerated electron–hole pair
separation efficiency and enhance the activities and stabilities of
photocatalysts. Crystalline metal phosphides, serving as efficient
and robust cocatalysts, can produce H2 at a high rate under
sunlight irradiation, as reported in our previous work.29 Du and co-workers prepared a core–shell
amorphous CoPx/CdS photocatalyst in situ.30 Nevertheless, CoPx showed no diffraction peaks, which indicated that this material
could be amorphous. Herein, we report a moderate and controllable
method for the preparation of CoP in situ. Cobalt acetate was combined
with ammonium hydroxide to produce a yellow cobaltous hexammonate
salt; subsequently, the solution was heated to 80 °C to generate
a trivalent orange-yellow hexaamminecobalt salt. After solvothermal
treatment, Co3O4 was uniformly dispersed on
the surface of the CdS nanowires and phosphorized with NaH2PO2 at 300 °C to form the CoP nanoparticles in situ
(Figure 1).

Figure 1 Schematic illustration
of the preparation of CoP@CdS in situ.

The hexagonal CdSnw’s (JCPDS No. 77-2306) were prepared
according to a reported procedure.31 The
as-synthesized CdS was robust at 300 °C under Ar (Figure 2d) and was stable below 320
°C, as confirmed by thermogravimetric analysis (Figure S1). The intensity of CdS is extremely high in XRD,
and this is ascribed to the lower content of CoP compared to that
of CdS in the CoP@CdS(5%) catalyst; therefore, the pattern of CoP
cannot be observed from Figure 2d. The XRD patterns of CdSnw’s and CdS(300 °C)
show no difference, suggesting that CdS is stable when heated to 300
°C. The TEM images revealed that the crystalline CoP nanoparticles
(JCPDS No. 29-0497) were coated on the CdSnw’s with intimate
contact (Figures 2a
and S2). In addition, bare CoP and Co3O4 nanoparticles were also prepared in the same
way but in the absence of CdSnw’s (Figure S3). The high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image (Figure 2b) of CoP@CdS shows that the
CoP nanoparticles were less than 10 nm in diameter. The strong reflection
of the (211) plane corresponded to lattice fringes with a d-spacing of 0.19 nm, and a lattice spacing of 0.27 nm corresponded
to the (002) plane, which confirmed that the CoP nanoparticles were
successfully anchored to the surface of the CdSnw’s. Energy
dispersive X-ray (EDX) mapping images (Figure 2c) showed that Co and P were uniformly distributed
over the whole surface of the CdSnw’s. In addition, selected-area
electron diffraction indicated that the obtained sample contained
intense diffraction peaks, which were attributed to single-crystalline
CdS nanowires (Figure S4), and weak diffraction
peaks, which were assigned to CoP. The reason for the weak diffraction
peaks of CoP may be the very strong peaks of CdSnw’s and the
relatively small amount of CoP coated on the surface of the CdSnw’s. Figure 2e depicts the UV–vis
DRS of CoP@CdS. The band gaps of the samples were obtained using the
Tauc/Davis–Mott model, as shown in Figure 2f. Compared with bare CdS, with increasing
content of CoPa broad background absorption progressively increased
in the visible light range. The band-gap value of CoP@CdS was smaller
than that of CdS; the smallest band gap was 2.38 eV for CoP@CdS(5%). Figure 2g shows the transient
photocurrent responses of CdS and CoP@CdS(5%) during several on–off
cycles. The generated photocurrent mainly originated from the photoinduced
electrons diffusing to the indium tin oxide (ITO), which suggested
that a more efficient charge transfer was successfully observed through
the formation of the heterojunction.

response of CdS and CoP@CdS(5%).

Semiconductors absorb photons to produce electron and hole
pairs.
The electrons then migrate to the cocatalyst, and the protons combine
with electrons to produce atomic hydrogen. However, prior to the generation
of hydrogen, the atomic hydrogen formed on the metallic CoP may reduce
the nitro group. The reduction is a stepwise process via nitroso and
hydroxylamine intermediates, which may condense to coupling products,
as reported by Haber.9 Therefore, we could
utilize the reaction to study the photocatalytic ability of the prepared
CoP@CdS.

The reduction of nitroaromatic compounds was carried
out in anaerobic
water under white LED irradiation at room temperature. Previous work
with the Ni2P/CdS hybrid material obtained by grinding
the raw CdS and Ni2P nanoparticles showed that Na2S/Na2SO3 can be used as a reductant in the
hydrogenating reaction of the nitro group.10 In the present study, cheap and stable ammonium formate was used
as an electron donor. The content of CoP had a significant influence
on photocatalytic transformation. As shown in Table 1, as the CoP concentration increased from
1 to 5%, a gradual improvement in the yield of aniline was achieved,
whereas the amount of the azo and hydrazo intermediates decreased
rapidly. This was attributed to the higher amount of cocatalyst CoP,
which provided more active sites for the reduction of the nitro groups.
When the CoP content was increased to 7.5%, the selectivity to aniline
dropped, whereas the conversion of nitroarene changed slightly. This
could be because an excess of CoP nanoparticles coated on the surface
of CdS shielded the incident light and could also merge together and
reduce the amount of catalytic active sites. Therefore, the optimal
loading amount of CoP was 5%. In contrast, the yield of aniline obtained
with CoP/CdS(5%), which was prepared by grinding the two pure phases,
was much lower than that obtained with CoP@CdS prepared in situ. The
reactions with the CoP/CdS(5%) catalyst generated more azoxy and hydrazo
derivatives (Table 1, entry 6), which indicated that compactness and dispersivity had
a significant effect on the catalytic activity of the catalyst. Furthermore,
plasmonic metals such as Au have been studied for intense absorption
in the visible region because of surface plasmon resonance effects.31 The combination of Au and CdS could remedy their
drawbacks such as low photocatalytic efficiency and photocorrosion.
For comparison, Au@CdS(1.1%) was prepared by photodeposition, and
its catalytic ability for nitro reduction reached 63.2% yield of the
final reduction product in 10 h, which was slightly less than that
of CoP@CdS(5%) (conversion yield of 73.3%). It is well known that
Pt is also an efficient hydrogen-generating catalyst. We further measured
the reduction ability of 0.6% Pt@CdS under identical conditions. The
results demonstrated that the catalytic activity of Pt@CdS was not
better than that of the CoP@CdS(5%) sample. The photocatalytic activity
of CoP@CdS prepared in situ was comparable to that of catalysts formed
using noble metals loaded onto CdS. Control experiments showed that
the photocatalyst, light, and sacrificial agent were indispensable
(Table 1, entries 8–10).

It is interesting that the reduction of the nitro group in the
present system was accompanied by hydrogen evolution. Figure 3 shows the H2 evolution
process with ammonium formate as the sacrificial agent in the absence
of nitroarene. However, when 4-nitrotoluene was introduced into the
system, the rate of hydrogen production became very slow. After 4-nitrotoluene
was almost consumed, the hydrogen production rate increased after
14 h. The conversion was 76.2% after the first 2 h, whereas the selectivity
for aniline was only 16.8% and the main product was the azo compound.
Subsequently, the selectivity of aniline gradually increased with
time, whereas the conversion increased slowly. This indicated that
the nitro group was easy to reduce to an azo group and the amount
of product controlled by the dynamics process was more important at
the initial stage of the reaction.27 Therefore,
we can conclude that the condensation route was the major pathway
for nitro reduction in the present system (Figure S5) and the major reduction products can be tuned by controlling
the reaction time. For comparison, azobenzene was used as a substrate;
after 10 h of irradiation, the main product was hydrazobenzene and
a small amount of aminobenzene was obtained. The result showed that
hydrazo compounds were a big hurdle for obtaining aniline. However,
when nitroarene was used as a substrate, the produced azo compound
was converted to aniline faster than similar azo derivative was used
as the substrate, which suggested that oxyazobenzene generated in
the condensation reaction plays an important role in the formation
of aniline. A detailed investigation of this reaction is under way.
In addition, 1 atm of hydrogen instead of ammonium formate was utilized
to reduce the nitroarene under the same conditions, but no product
was detected. Furthermore, when 2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-1-piperidinyloxy
was employed to trap atomic hydrogen in the reaction system, the conversion
of the substrate dropped greatly. Therefore, the activated hydrogen
species, rather than the produced dihydrogen, drives the reduction
reaction. The kinetic isotope effect was investigated in water and
deuterated water (Figure S6). The ratio
between kH and kD was determined to be 1.37, which suggested that the O–H(D)
bond cleavage was critical to the whole reduction.

Figure 3 Time-dependent conversion,
selectivity, and H2 production
of the catalytic system containing 0.1 mmol of 4-nitrotoluene, 4 mg
of the catalyst, 5 mL of H2O, and 2 mmol of HCOONH4.

The reduction reaction induced
by visible light was further extended
to other nitroarenes (Table 2). From a synthesis perspective, it is challenging to selectively
reduce a nitro group while keeping other reducible groups unchanged.
Vulnerable functional groups such as aldehydes, ketones, alkynyls,
and cyanos were introduced into this photocatalytic system. The nitro
group was reduced selectively, and the vulnerable groups remained
unchanged. As reported by other research groups, halogenated nitroarenes
were expected to dehalogenate during nitro reduction.9,10 Nevertheless, in the studied system, dehalogenation was suppressed
and halogenated anilines were observed with high selectivity. In addition,
a high conversion efficiency was obtained with nitroarenes containing
electron-withdrawing groups, whereas high selectivity for aniline
was obtained with nitroarenes containing electron-donating groups.
After a long irradiation time (>12 h), azo compounds nearly disappeared
and the main byproduct was a hydrazo compound, except for the case
of 4-nitrophenylacetylene.

The durability of the CoP@CdS
photocatalyst was examined through
the reduction of 4-nitrotoluene to 4-toluidine. The used photocatalyst
was recycled by centrifugation, washed with ethanol and deionized
water, and dried at 60 °C in a vacuum oven. The activity of the
photocatalyst in this system remained the same after eight successive
runs (Figure 4).

4 Conclusions
In summary, CoP@CdS was used
as an efficient and robust photocatalyst
for the reduction of nitroarene. The catalyst was fabricated using
hexaamminecobalt salt to produce Co3O4 in situ
and phosphorized by a solid-state thermal reaction. Crystalline CoP
was coated on the CdSnw’s with close contact and even dispersion.
The nitro reduction was driven by hydrogen species originating from
the photocatalytic reaction rather than by dihydrogen. The photocatalytic
reduction of the nitro group proceeded through a condensation pathway,
and the desired products azobenzene and aniline were obtained by controlling
the irradiation time. Vulnerable functional groups remained unchanged
during the reduction.
