A water-soluble triazole-linked
quinoline conjugate of glucopyranose
(L) has been synthesized and characterized, and its single-crystal
X-ray diffraction (XRD) structure has been established. Binding of L toward different biologically relevant metal ions has been
studied using fluorescence and absorption spectroscopy in HEPES buffer
at pH 7.4. The conjugate L detects Zn2+ and
Cd2+ with 30 ± 2 and 14 ± 1-fold fluorescence
enhancement, respectively, but in the case of Hg2+, only
a fluorescence quench was observed. The stoichiometry of the complex
is 1:2 metal ion to the ligand in the case of Zn2+ and
Cd2+ resulting in [Zn(L)2] and
[Cd(L)2], and it is 1:1 in the case of Hg2+, as confirmed from their electrospray ionization mass spectrometry
(ESIMS) spectra. Zn2+ shows greater exothermicity over
Cd2+, whereas Hg2+ shows endothermicity , which
supports the differences in their binding strength and the nature
of the corresponding complex. L exhibits rod-shaped particles
and upon complexation with Zn2+, it exhibits sphere-like
morphological features in scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images.
However, clustered aggregates are observed in Cd2+, whereas
the [HgL] complex exhibits small fused spherical structures,
and therefore the signature of these ions is seen in microscopy images.
The computational studies revealed that the syn-[Zn(L)2] complex is stabilized by 9.7 kcal mol–1 more than that in the case of anti-[Zn(L)2] owing to the formation of hydrogen
bonds between the two glucosyl moieties within the syn-complex. Among the anions studied, [Zn(L)2] is sensitive and selective toward the phosphate ion (H2PO4–) with a minimum detection limit
of 16 ± 2 ppb. Similarly, the [HgL] can act as a
secondary sensor for CN– while also exhibiting reversibility.
Based on the input–output characteristics, INHIBIT logic gate
was built in the case of Zn2+ vs H2PO4– and IMPLICATION logic gate was built in the case
of Hg2+ vs CN–.

Introduction
Metal ions play important
roles in various biological processes
including in diseases.1−3 Among these metals, zinc is an essential element
that is present as a cofactor of several enzymes working in gene transcription,
neurotransmission, regulation of metalloenzymes, and mammalian reproduction.4−9 However, zinc imbalance causes neurological diseases including Alzheimer’s
and Parkinson’s disease.10−13 Therefore, this brings in a demand for the design
and demonstration of water soluble and biologically benign small-molecular
receptors for the detection and sensing of Zn2+.14−19 However, such detection is always challenged by the ions of the
same group, viz., Cd2+ and Hg2+. Although the
literature is rich with small organic molecular-based sensors for
Zn2+,20−29 studies on those which exhibit water solubility, biological compatibility,
and yet differentiate Zn2+ from its group members are rather
scarce.30−32 Although the glyco-conjugate-based receptor that
is reported in the literature offers water solubility and biological
compatibility, it fails in differentiating Zn2+ from its
subgroup members.33−38 A recent demonstration includes the glycosylated naphthalimide acting
as a sensitive fluorescent probe for Zn2+, which exhibited
enhanced aqueous sensitivity and lowered the cytotoxicity.39 In another paper, pyridyl-triazole-substituted
β-cyclodextrin was reported for sensing Zn2+ in the
CH3OH medium.33 These literature
reports do not include the studies with Cd2+ and Hg2+. Therefore, a glyco-based molecular system (L) that is water soluble and biologically benign has been designed
and developed by connecting the glucosyl and quinoline moieties through
the triazole linker to differentiate Zn2+ from Cd2+ and Hg2+, as depicted in Scheme 1. The presence of quinoline group in L not only provides a coordination core but also shows variation
in its fluorescence emission that is dependent upon the nature of
the metal ion present. The metal ion-binding ability and the selectivity
of L for Zn2+ over Cd2+ and Hg2+ have been demonstrated using proton nuclear magnetic resonance
(1H NMR), emission, absorption, and isothermal titration
calorimetry (ITC) spectra, microscopy, and the stoichiometry of the
species formed by using electrospray ionization mass spectrometry
(ESIMS).
The structural features of the complex of Zn2+ formed with L have been demonstrated using density functional theory (DFT)
computations. Thus, in the present paper, L has been
demonstrated for fluorescence turn on, its visual
detectability for Zn2+, its recyclability by H2PO4–, and its differential features
when compared to Cd2+ and Hg2+. All studies
were carried out in HEPES buffer at pH 7.4.

Results and Discussion
Design, Synthesis, and Characterization of
the Probe Molecule
(L)
The probe molecule has been designed to
have an ion-binding core, water solubility, and biological compatibility
by using a glyco-moiety along with a fluorescent group to give its
response upon interaction with metal ions (Scheme 1). Thus, a triazole-linked quinoline conjugate
of glucopyranose (L) was synthesized by going through
three different reaction steps, starting from d-glucose (P1) and 8-hydroxyquinoline (P3). The tetra acetyl-β-glucopyranosyl
azide (P2) and 8-propargyloxyquinoline
(P4) derivatives were synthesized
by adapting the procedures reported in the literature.40 The 1,3-dipolar addition
reaction carried out between P2 and P4 resulted in a triazole
precursor (P5), which finally
upon deacetylation resulted in L (Scheme 1). The precursors and L were
characterized using different spectral techniques such as 1H and 13C NMR and ESIMS, respectively (Experimental Section and Figures S1–S3).

Single-Crystal X-ray Diffraction (XRD) Structure of the Probe
Molecule (L)
The 3D structure of L was established using single-crystal XRD. Single crystals of L were grown from the dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) solution prepared
for its NMR spectral measurements. L crystallized in
the monoclinic system with a P21 space
group (Figure 1a),
the crystal structure was solved using the diffraction data collected
at 150 K and was refined, and the data were summarized.41 The corresponding coordinates as well as the
bond lengths and bond angle data are given in Figure S4.

the intermolecular π···π interactions present
between the molecules in the lattice. (b) Packing diagram of L showing hydrogen bonding.

The single-crystal XRD structure of L shown
in the
inset of Figure 1b
takes up a z-like structure where the plane of the quinoline and the
average plane of the glucosyl moiety are oriented perpendicular to
each other. The structure shows the glucose unit in its 4C1 chair conformation with a β-anomeric form. The
anomeric nature has also been deduced from the 1H NMR spectra.
The distance between the centroids of the two quinolines from the
neighbor molecules in the lattice is 3.95 Å, suggesting the presence
of π···π stacking interaction between these
rings (Figure 1b). Figure 1b clearly shows four
strong O–H···N/O intermolecular hydrogen bonds,
and the corresponding H-bond data are given in Table 1. Both the aromatic π···π
stacking and the hydrogen-bonding interactions together stabilize
the structure.

Differential Ion Binding of L Using Fluorescence
Spectroscopy
The ion-binding nature of L was
studied by monitoring the fluorescence emission of HEPES buffer solutions
at 410 nm when excited at 310 nm. The fluorescence emission of L was weak because of the photoinduced electron transfer (PET).
The weakly fluorescing L was studied with different biologically
and ecologically important metal ions, viz., Na+, Mg2+, K+, Ca2+, Mn2+, Fe2+, Co2+, Ni2+, Cu2+, Zn2+, and Pb2+ by maintaining the concentration of L at 5 μM and varying the mole ratio of the metal ion
added. Incremental addition of Zn2+ to L resulted
in gradual enhancement in fluorescence emission to a maximum of 30
± 2-fold (Figure 2a), and λmax showed a red shift of 15 nm (inset
of Figure 2a). All
this is attributable to the interaction followed by binding of Zn2+ to L to result in a complex of 1:2, which was
further confirmed using ESIMS as reported in this paper. Among the
ions from the same group, only Cd2+ showed a 14 ±
1-fold enhancement with a red shift of 12 nm of the emission maximum
(Figure 2b), whereas
Hg2+ showed marginal quenching (Figure 2c) and all of the other metal ions exhibit
no significant change in the emission intensity (Figure S5). Thus, L provides differential emission
characteristics among the ions of zinc subgroup but is more sensitive
to Zn2+ (Figure 2d,e). The minimum concentrations that could be detected by L were 15 ± 2 (24 ± 2 nM), 42 ± 3 (38 ±
3 nM), and 65 ± 6 (34 ± 3 nM) ppb for Zn2+, Cd2+, and Hg2+, respectively, thus supporting three
or four times higher sensitivity for Zn2+ over Cd2+ or Hg2+ (Figure S6). The probe L showed different features and a lower detection value as
compared to other recently developed fluorescent probes in the literature
for Zn2+ in an aqueous medium (Figure S7).

HEPES buffer. Insets of (a–c): Plots of relative fluorescence

Histogram showing the fluorescence titration responses of L with Zn2+ in the presence of competitive metal ions (100
μM), [A] = {L + Zn2+}. Inset: Colorimetric
titration for the same under the incident light of 365 nm.

Under the incident light of 365 nm, only the solution
containing
[L + Zn2+] and [L + Cd2+] exhibits strong and weak bluish fluorescent color, respectively,
whereas all other solutions, viz., [L + M1+/2+], exhibit no color change (inset of Figure 2e). In the competitive metal ion titrations,
the fluorescence intensity of {(L + Zn2+)
+ Mn+} is unaltered and is the same as
that of {L + Zn2+} in the case of all Mn+ studied except for Cu2+ and
Hg2+ (Figure 2f). Hence, the noninterfering sensing of Zn2+ is valid
for all of these ions except for Cu2+ and Hg2+.

In the control molecule P4, both the triazole and glucose moieties are absent, and in P5, the glucosyl moiety is peracetylated
and hence free OH groups of glucose are not available. Thus both of
these control molecules are devoid of water-soluble glucose moiety.
Titration of Zn2+ with P5 shows only an 8 ± 1-fold increase in fluorescence intensity
under the same conditions (Figure S8),
suggesting that the presence of the carbohydrate moiety imparts more
sensitivity in terms of fold of enhancement in addition to improving
the water solubility and providing biocompatibility to L. Similar fluorescence titration studies were carried out even with P4, and this showed only ∼2-fold
enhancement in fluorescence intensity when Zn2+ was bound.
This is because of the presence of incomplete binding core arising
only from the quinoline moiety, suggesting the necessity of triazole
and glucosyl moieties in sensitive and selective recognition of Zn2+. Comparison of the results obtained from the control systems
with those from L supports the necessity of both quinoline
and triazole moieties for binding and the glucose moiety to impart
water solubility and biocompatibility in the sensitive recognition
of Zn2+ (Figure S8).

Differential
Ion Binding Using Absorption Spectroscopy
To further support
the differential binding of ions of zinc subgroup
to L, absorption spectral studies were carried out. In
the case of Zn2+ titration, the absorbance of ∼340
and 250 nm bands increases and that of 285 nm decreases (Figure 3a). Thus, the spectral
changes observed and the isosbestic crossings that occurred at 275
and 305 nm clearly suggest the formation of a complex between L and Zn2+ (Figure 3a). Even Cd2+ and Hg2+ showed
similar changes in the absorption spectra (Figure 3b); however, the changes observed in the
absorbance of all of these bands is only around one-half of those
observed in the case of Zn2+, suggesting a stronger interaction
between L and Zn2+ as compared to the other
ions (Figure 3c). The
Job’s plot yielded a 1:2 complex between Zn2+/Cd2+ and L, whereas it is 1:1 in the case of Hg2+ (Figure S9). The absorption data
yielded Ka of 65 423 ± 960
M–2, 28 442 ± 470 M–2, and 21 562 ± 270 M–1, respectively,
for Zn2+, Cd2+, and Hg2+ suggesting
that the binding of Zn2+ is about 2 and 3 times stronger
than that of Cd2+ and Hg2+, respectively (Figure S10). This indeed reflects on their relative
binding strengths, and further support was sought based on ITC studies.
The metal-ion-to-ligand ratio present in these complexes is evident
from ESIMS. All other Mn+ ions exhibit
no significant change in the corresponding absorption spectra, suggesting
that none of these ions form a complex with L (Figure S11).

Differential Binding of Ions to L Using ITC and
the Composition of the Complex Formed Using ESIMS
To understand
the thermodynamic aspects of the binding of Zn2+, Cd2+, and Hg2+ to L, ITC studies were
performed, and the thermograms are given in Figures 4 and S12. Although
the interaction of Zn2+ and Cd2+ with L is exothermic, that of Hg2+ is endothermic. Between
Zn2+ and Cd2+, Zn2+ is largely exothermic,
which is at least twice as that of Cd2+. All this supports
the differential binding of ions of the zinc subgroup, with a greater
sensitivity being imparted for Zn2+ by L (Figure 4). This result is
in line with that observed from the spectral data. The negative ΔS values are indicative of the formation of the complex
in these cases. The observed endothermic nature of the titration of L with Hg2+ suggests that Hg2+ interacts
with L differently than Zn2+ and Cd2+. This is because the Hg2+ ion is chemically soft and
is larger in size than its congeners, viz., Zn2+ and Cd2+. Whereas Zn2+ and Cd2+ are predominantly
bound in the core, the softer Hg2+ exhibits cation···π
interaction, and this leads to exothermic interaction in the case
of Zn2+ and Cd2+ and endothermic in the case
of Hg2+ (Figure 4c). The binding of Hg2+ with L is
through cation···π and not through the hetero-atom
binding core, and this has already been shown by us in other receptor
molecules.42−44 Because this type of complexation is much weaker
than that when bound to the hetero atoms, this is not expected to
decrease the randomness of the system, rather it increases the disorder,
giving rise to positive entropy.

titration of metal ions with L.

To confirm the composition of the complexes formed by the
ions
of zinc subgroup with L, ESIMS studies were carried out.
The HRMS spectra for the titrations of L with Zn2+ showed a molecular ion peak at an m/z = 839.18 {100%, [2L + Zn–H+]+} that corresponds to the 2:1 complex between L and Zn2+ (Figure 5a). The isotopic peak pattern observed with this peak
resembles that of the calculated one, supporting the presence of Zn2+ in this species, and thus confirms the formation of the
complex (Figure 5b,c).
Similarly the formation of the 2:1 complex between L and
Cd2+ has been further confirmed by ESIMS, where the spectra
showed molecular ion peaks at m/z of 889.16 for the complex of Cd2+ (Figure S13). However, in the case of Hg2+, the m/z = 588.43 peak corresponds to the 1:1
complex between Hg2+ and L. Based on the ESIMS
data, the lower peak area ratios of the complex vs free L observed in the case of Cd2+ and Hg2+ support
their weak binding nature as compared to that of Zn2+ and
thus impart differential binding of the ions of zinc subgroup to L. Further, the formation of the 1:1 complex in the case of
Hg2+ suggests that the complex formed in this case is different
from that of Zn2+ and Cd2+.

Zn2+ Binding to L Using 1H NMR
and the Structural Features of the [Zn(L)2] Complex Using DFT
1H NMR titration also
supported the binding of Zn2+ to L, where
the spectra were measured using 5 mM [L] (Figure 6a). Upon addition of Zn2+ to L, the peaks corresponding to the aromatic
(“a”), triazole (“b”), and −CH2 connecting to the triazole (“d”)
showed minimal to marginal changes in their δ values supporting
its binding to the core formed by the triazole and quinoline moieties
as shown in Figure 6b. The corresponding results can be seen from the plots of chemical
shifts vs the mole ratio of Zn2+ as given in Figure 6c. When L is titrated
with Cd2+ and Hg2+, only a marginal change was
observed in their δ values (Figure S14), thus supporting the differential binding of ions of the zinc subgroup.

Having determined the stoichiometry of the complex formed
between
Zn2+ and L using ESIMS and the region of binding
using 1H NMR, the structural features of the complex formed
were established using the DFT computational study, and the corresponding
details are given in the Experimental Section. The optimized structure of L was used for the metal
ion complexation study, which was also optimized in DFT. Both isomeric
complexes, viz., syn-[Zn(L)2] and anti-[Zn(L)2], were
optimized at the same level of theory. All of the optimized structures
are given in Figure 7a–e, and the corresponding metric data for the coordination
cores are given in Figure S15.

(d,e) Structure of the anti-[Zn(L)2] complex and its primary coordination sphere.

In the optimized structures of both syn- and anti-[Zn(L)2] complexes
(Figure 7b,c), Zn2+ exhibits the N4O2 core where L acts as tridentate. Comparison of the coordination spheres
reveals
that the Zn–N bond distances are elongated in the case of anti- as compared to the syn-complex. The syn-isomer exhibits greater interaction energy than that
of the anti-complex by 9.7 kcal/mol owing to the
intracomplex hydrogen bonds present between the two sugar moieties,
and this occurs only in the case of syn- and not
in the case of anti-complex. The optimized structure
exhibits distorted octahedral geometry about Zn2+ with
N4O2 core arising from both L
(Figure 7d,e). In the
optimized complex, the highest occupied molecular orbitals (HOMOs)
have the contribution from trizole and quinoline, whereas the lowest
unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMOs) have the contribution mainly
from the quinoline moiety (Figure S15).

Characterization of the Isolated [Zn(L)2]
Complex
The [Zn(L)2] complex was
isolated from a reaction carried out between L and Zn(ClO4)2 in methanol and was characterized using absorption,
emission, and ESIMS (Figure S16). The absorption
spectrum of the complex showed increased absorbance at 340 and 250
nm and decreased absorbance in the 285 nm band as compared to that
of L. The complex shows strong emission at 410 nm, which
is comparable with the in situ generated complex in the solution.
The 1:2 ratio of Zn2+ to L composition in
the complex was further confirmed from the peak observed at m/z = 839.16 and its isotopic peak pattern
that is characteristic of zinc in the ESIMS spectra (Figure S16).

Differential Binding of Ions to L Using Microscopy
Because the binding strengths and the
metal ion-to-the-ligand compositions
differ among the complexes of the zinc subgroup ions with L, their influence on the aggregation of the glyco-conjugate (L) was studied using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The
receptor L exhibits rod-shaped particles that are well-spread
all over the alumina surface as studied using SEM. However, in the
presence of Zn2+, these particles merge to result in a
spherical aggregation as shown in Figures 8 and S17. Thus,
both the size and the shape of the particles change on going from
simple L (54 ± 4 nm, rods) to its Zn2+ complex (328 ± 25 nm, spherical) because of the Zn2+-induced aggregation. Thus the size of the particles of L is increased sixfold upon binding with Zn2+. However,
Cd2+ induces aggregation of L to result in
cluster-type species with an average size of 565 ± 45 nm, whereas
the [HgL] complex exhibits small fused spherical particles
where the individual particle has an average size of 115 ± 9
nm and each of these is smaller than the spherical species observed
in the case of the Zn2+ complex (Figure 8). All microscopy data support the induced
molecular aggregation in L upon interaction followed
by complexation by Zn2+, and this is much different from
that induced by Cd2+ and Hg2+. Further, we have
studied the effect of nonbinding Mn2+ on the molecular
aggregation in L and showed that no change occurs in
the morphological features when studied using SEM. The morphological
features observed in SEM seem to be dependent upon the binding ability
of the metal ion added to L. Thus, L can
differentiate Zn2+ from Cd2+ and Hg2+ ions based on the morphological changes observed in SEM pictures.

and (l) are for {L + Hg2+}.

Differential Sensing of Anion/Phosphate by
the Complexes of
Zinc Subgroup Ions
Owing to the strong affinity of Zn2+ toward phosphates, the fluorescent Zn2+ complex
[Zn(L)2] reported in this paper has been studied
for its ability to sense anions, such as F–, Cl–, Br–, I–, N3–, CO32–, NO2–, NO3–, SCN–, SO42–, ClO4–, HSO4–, HCO3–, H2PO4–, AMP2–, ADP2–, ATP2–, and P2O74– (PPi). Incremental
addition of H2PO4– to the
[Zn(L)2] complex shows gradual quenching of
fluorescence intensity, which saturates at >4 equiv (Figure 9a), suggesting the removal
of Zn2+ from this complex by H2PO4–. Among the phosphate-based anions studied, the
fluorescence quenching follows an order, H2PO4– > AMP2– > ADP2– > ATP2– >PPi4–, suggesting
that
H2PO4– dechelates the Zn2+ ion from the complex more effectively (Figure 9a) to a lowest detection limit
of 16 ± 2 ppb for H2PO4–. Similarly, the [Cd(L)2] complex also shows
binding of H2PO4– among the
phosphates and other anions studied, although its sensitivity is lower
than the [Zn(L)2] complex (Figure S18). However, the [HgL] complex does
not show any change in its fluorescence intensity in the presence
of any of these anions, including those of phosphate-based ones. On
the other hand, the titration of the [HgL] complex by
CN– enhances the fluorescence intensity such that
it attains the intensity to a level that is actually exhibited by
the receptor alone (Figure 9c) supporting that Hg2+ is detached from its [HgL] complex to release L free into the medium.
As a result, the [HgL] complex is useful to detect a
minimum concentration of CN– of 26 ± 2 ppb.
Thus, the dechelation of the metal ion from the complex followed by
the release of free L into the medium is further supported
by absorption changes and mass spectra (Figure S19).

Figure 9 (a,b) [Zn(L)2] complex and (c,d)
[HgL] complex. (a) and (b) are fluorescence spectral
traces obtained
in the titration of the complex with the anion in HEPES buffer indicated
in (b), and (d) shows fluorescence intensity of the complex followed
by the anion (H2PO4– in the
case of zinc complex and CN– in the case of mercury
complex) for different cycles (reversibility test): M2+ and anion are added sequentially, for example, (1) = L; (2) = L + M2+; (3) = (2) + anion; (4) =
(3) +M2+; (5) = (4) + anion; (6) = (5) + M2+; (7) = (6) + anion; (8) = (7) + M2+.

Reusability and Reversibility of the Receptor
The reusability
of L has been demonstrated by carrying out four alternative
cycles of titration of L with Zn2+ followed
by H2PO4–. The switch-onand switch-off of L were studied
by monitoring the fluorescence changes as a function of the addition
of Zn2+ followed by H2PO4– for four consecutive cycles (Figure 9b), and it was found that the recovery of the fluorescence
intensity was >90%. Hence, L is a reversible and reusable
sensor for Zn2+ and its zinc complex [Zn(L)2] as a secondary sensor for H2PO4–. Similarly, even the [HgL] complex
shows fluorescence on with CN– and off when Hg2+ is added once again. This has been
repeated for four alternative cycles of titration of L with Hg2+ followed by the CN– ion and
the changes have been found to be consistent (Figure 9d).

Molecular Logic Gate
The selective recognition features
of metal ion complexes toward anions can be used to construct the
molecular logic gate.45,46 In this study, the anion and
M2+ act as inputs, whereas the emission intensity at 410
nm (I410) band acts as the output. The
output “0” corresponds to the gate being closed and
hence termed OFF. The output “1” corresponds
to the gate being open and hence termed ON. Thus,
[(L)2Zn] can act as INHIBIT (INH) logic gate
for H2PO4–, whereas [LHg] can act as IMPLICATION logic gate for CN– as shown in Figure 10.

Conclusions and Correlations
Triazole-linked quinoline conjugate of glucopyranose (L) has been synthesized and characterized. The structure of L was established using single-crystal XRD. In the lattice,
the molecule is stabilized by aromatic π···π
stacking and hydrogen bonding interactions. The differential binding
studies of the zinc subgroup ion by L were demonstrated
based on fluorescence, absorption, 1H NMR spectroscopy,
and calorimetry. The conjugate L showed 30 ± 2-
and 14 ± 1-fold fluorescence enhancement for Zn2+ and
Cd2+, respectively, and in the case of Hg2+,
fluorescence quenching was observed. L can detect the
Zn2+, Cd2+, and Hg2+ ions differentially
using fluorescence spectroscopy, and the observed trend in the sensitivity,
viz., Zn2+ ≫ Cd2+ > Hg2+,
suggests that the sensitivity for Zn2+ is greater by four
times as compared to that of Cd2+ and six times as compared
to that of Hg2+. Their minimum detection values are indeed
reflected on their association constants, which also follows a similar
trend, viz., Zn2+ ≫ Cd2+ > Hg2+, suggesting that the binding of Zn2+ is about
∼2.5
and 3 times stronger than that of Cd2+ and Hg2+. The Job’s plot suggests the formation of the 2:1 complex
between L and Zn2+, and the ESIMS confirms
the composition by yielding a m/z = 839.18 peak and its associated isotopic peak pattern. This was
further supported by the ITC data, where Zn2+ shows greater
exothermicity than Cd2+ and Hg2+ which are endothermic.

The DFT computations of the 2:1 complex species of [Zn(L)2] revealed that the syn-isomer of the
[Zn(L)2] complex is stabilized by 9.7 kcal
mol–1 more than that of the anti-isomer. The fluorescent zinc complex, viz., [Zn(L)2] is selective toward the H2PO4– ion among all anions studied, with a minimum concentration
detection of 16 ± 2 ppb. All of these features can be clearly
noticed from Scheme 2. The three complexes, viz., [Zn(L)2], [Cd(L)2], and [HgL], were studied for their anion sensing. The selective sensing
and reversibility were observed primarily in the case of [Zn(L)2] by H2PO4– through turn off fluorescence
and in the case of [HgL] for CN– through turn on fluorescence. However, among the [Zn(L)2] and [Cd(L)2] complexes, the Zn2+ complex has greater sensitivity
and hence imparts better selectivity. The fluorescence responses of L have been used as output to build INHIBIT and IMPLICATION
logic gates for Zn2+ vs H2PO4–, respectively, and Hg2+ vs CN– as inputs, respectively.

Scheme 2 Schematic Representation of the Salient
Features
The glyco-conjugate-based
receptors reported in the literature
were not studied for differentiating Zn2+ from its subgroup
members.33−39 Thus, the present molecular system offers several advantages such
as (i) greater number of fold of fluorescence enhancement, (ii) larger
separation in their minimum detection values, which in turn is reflected
on their association constants, (iii) greater exothermicity in the
case of Zn2+ over Cd2+ and endothermicity in
the case of Hg2+, (iv) metal-ion-dependent morphological
variations observed in their SEM, viz., spherical in the case of Zn2+, cluster-type aggregates in Cd2+, and small fused
spherical structures in Hg2+, (v) reversible Zn2+ binding by the addition of H2PO4– by switch-off fluorescence and that of Hg2+ by CN– by switch-on, and (vi)
INHIBIT logic gate in Zn2+ vs H2PO4– and IMPLICATION logic gate in Hg2+ vs CN–.

Thus L is a water-soluble
and biologically compatible
glyco-conjugate that can differentiate Zn2+ from its congeners,
wherein the spectroscopy and microscopy provide distinct features
for Zn2+ as compared to that of Cd2+ and Hg2+, and its logic gate parameters provide a hinge to use this
in analytical sciences.

Experimental Section
General Information
1H and 13C NMR spectra were measured on Bruker
NMR spectrometers working at
400 and 500 MHz, respectively. The mass spectra were recorded on a
Q-TOF micromass (YA-105) using electrospray ionization method. The
electronic absorption and emission spectra were measured on a Varian
Cary 100 Bio and a Perkin-Elmer LS55 spectrometer, respectively. All
metal perchlorates and other salts corresponding to various anions
used in this paper were procured from Sigma Chemical Co., USA.

Fluorescence
and Absorption Titrations
Fluorescence
emission spectra were measured in 320–600 nm by exciting the
samples at λex = 310 nm. Initially, 50 μL of
DMSO was used for dissolving the receptor L and was diluted
to the requisite volume (2 mL) using 10 mM HEPES buffer to prepare
a 6 × 10–4 M stock solution. All measurements
were taken in a 1 cm cuvette using 25 μL of 6 × 10–4 M stock solution L and keeping the total
volume fixed at 3 mL, so that the effective concentration of L is maintained at 5 μM in the cuvette all through.
During the titration, the volume of the added metal perchlorate solution
was varied accordingly to result in the requisite mole ratios of metal
ion to L (0–25). For the absorption spectral studies,
the cuvette concentration of L was 10 μM.

1H NMR Titration
The receptor L (4 mM) was dissolved
in 0.4 mL of DMSO-d6, and 1H NMR spectra were recorded in the absence and
in the presence of the metal ions. Metal ion titrations were carried
out by adding different mole ratios (0–10) of Zn2+, Cd2+, and Hg2+.

Isothermal Calorimetric
Titrations
The calorimetric
titrations were performed at 25 °C with a MicroCal ITC 200 isothermal
titration calorimeter (MicroCal, USA). All solutions were degassed
for 30 min before performing the experiment. Titration was carried
out by adding a 0.5 mM solution of metal ions (Zn2+, Cd2+, and Hg2+) to 200 μL of 0.05 mM solution
of the ligand (L) in the ITC cell by 20 successive injections
of 2 μL of M2+, while maintaining 200 s between each
addition for a total addition of 40 μL of metal ions. The ITC
data were fitted with the original software package provided with
the instrument by using the curve-fitting model for one set of sites.
Each time, a control experiment was carried out without taking L, and the corresponding one was subtracted from the main
titration data and the resultant data were subjected to the curve
fitting.

SEM Studies
The SEM samples of L, [L + Zn2+], [L + Cd2+],
and [L + Hg2+] were prepared at 6 × 10–4 M. These solutions were sonicated for 10 min, after
which 20–30 μL of aliquot was taken and spread over an
aluminum sheet using the drop-cast method. The samples were then dried
under infrared (IR) lamp and were analyzed using SEM.

Computational
Details
To understand the structural
features of the complex formed between L and Zn2+, the structure of L was initially optimized at the
wB97xD47,48 level of theory using the 6-31G(d,p) basis
set. L was independently optimized using the coordinates
obtained from the crystal structure of L reported in
this paper using different theories in a cascade fashion as, semiempirical
→ PM6 → DFT. The optimized structure of L obtained at this stage was used for the metal-ion complexation study,
which was further optimized using PM6 followed by DFT. Population
analysis of ligand L was carried out to predict the character
of the HOMO. Similarly, the structure of the {2L + Zn2+} complex was optimized initially at PM6 followed by DFT.
These have been used in conjunction with 6-31G(d,p) incorporating
the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) basis set and LANL2DZ for Zn2+ through
the Gaussian 09 package.

Synthesis and Characterization of L
To
a solution of P5 (540.0 mg, 0.01
mmol) in MeOH (5 mL) was added 1 mL of a 0.2 M solution of NaOMe in
MeOH. The reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature until the
starting material was consumed as checked by TLC. The solution was
neutralized by adding a cation-exchange resin (H+) followed
by filtration and washing with MeOH. The solvent was then removed
under vacuum, and the product was obtained as solid in 75% yield (293
mg). 1H NMR (400 MHz, DMSO-d6, δppm): 3.2–3.27 (m, 1H), 3.3–3.4
