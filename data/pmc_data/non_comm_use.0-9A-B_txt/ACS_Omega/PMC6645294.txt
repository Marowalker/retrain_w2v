Nowadays,
photocatalysis has gained tremendous interest owing to
the fact that it can overcome water crisis as well as the environmental
issues by utilizing a major source of solar energy. The nanohybrid
structures of Gd3+- and Sn4+-doped bismuth ferrite
(Bi1–xGdxFe1–ySny; BGFSO) with two-dimensional (2D) MXene sheets are synthesized by
the coprecipitation method. The 2D sheets have a large surface area,
incorporation of which into Bi1–xGdxFe1–ySny (BGFSO) nanoparticles provides
a path for electrons to flow, which results in large recombination
time and thus enhances dye degradation. The Bi0.90Gd0.10Fe0.80Sn0.20O3/MXene (BGFO-20Sn/MXene)
nanohybrid shows 100% degradation of Congo dye from the catalytic
solution in 120 min, which is highly efficient for industrial application.

1 Introduction
Over the last few years,
a vast increase in environmental pollution
has taken place, which introduces the contaminants into the environment
causing instability, harm, or disorder to the ecosystem. Water pollution
that occurs due to the industrial wastes containing toxic chemicals
affects human life and interrupts photosynthetic activity; decreases
soil fertility; affects the production of crops; induces toxicity
to aquatic life; and causes hazardous diseases such as skin cancer,
skin allergies, etc. These potential risks related to polluted water
rivers have been increased vastly by the discharge of innumerable
kinds of textile organic dyes into fresh water streams, consequently,
producing wastewaters. Due to the increasing demand of potable water,
it is necessary to treat polluted water to make it purified and useful
for drinking purposes.1

Photocatalysis
is a low-cost and useful technique to purify water
from different organic pollutants with end product in the form of
water molecules and carbon dioxide. Congo red (CR) is a benzidine-based
azo dye containing an anionic complex structure. The treatment of
polluted water containing Congo red dye is difficult due to the complicated
anionic structure that opposes its degradation.

Metal oxide-based
photocatalysts are helpful in purifying the polluted
water by the removal of hazardous compounds like organic dyes (such
as Congo red).2−5 A photocatalyst is a material that undergoes oxidation and reduction
reactions on the material surface in the presence of charged particles,
i.e., electrons and holes, which further generate the species that
help out in dye degradation from a solution.6

In the past, the abundantly available semiconductor-based
photocatalysts
have been used to degrade organic dyes due to the fact that they are
easily recyclable. The n-type and p-type semiconductors both act as
a photocatalyst.7 In earlier times, TiO2 with a band gap
of 3.2 eV and ZnO with a band gap of 3.4 eV were used efficiently,
but their efficiency was not good due to their wide band gaps.8−10 Meanwhile, visible-light-active materials got more attention than
UV-active materials due to their narrow band gaps (2.1 eV). Recently,
BiFeO3 (BFO) was found to be a promising candidate for
photocatalysis due to its low band gap (2.2–2.6 eV) and mesoporous
structure. The band gap of BFO is further tuned by doping metal ions
such as tin (Sn4+), gadolinium (Gd3+), etc.
The tuning of band gap increases the charge generation as well as
its separation because of the formation of intermediate energy levels
between the valence band (VB) and the conduction band (CB).11 The doping of various metal ions into BFO nanoparticles
also decreases the crystallite size because of the decrease in the
nucleation rate due to the distortions induced in the crystal structure,
thus enhancing the surface area. The enhanced surface area allows
more dye molecules to be adsorbed and degraded from an aqueous solution.10−14

The two-dimensional (2D) materials having a large surface
area
play an essential role in overcoming the water pollution challenges.
The layered and porous structure of graphene enhances the photocatalytic
activity due to the separation of charge carriers and enhanced oxidation
and reduction reactions.15 The hybrid of
2D graphene sheets with TiO2 nanoparticles showed about
17% higher dye degradation than that from pure TiO2 nanoparticles.15−20,52,53 Recently, the nanohybrid of BFO with 2D graphene sheets was reported.
Dai et al. reported that 50% degradation efficiency
of methyl orange in 6 h can be achieved using the BiFeO3/GO nanohybrid under visible light irradiation.25 Li et al. synthesized the BFO/GO nanohybrid and reported
48% degradation of colored dye (Congo red) in 120 min by the interaction
of visible light with the hybrid surface. Later on, researchers worked
out on 2D structures to further improve the degradation efficiency
using doped BFO nanoparticles. In 2011, a new family of 2D materials,
namely, MXene, was reported, which were more efficient than graphene
due to their diversity in structures as well as good conductivity
and semiconducting nature.21−26 They are composed of transition metal carbides and nitrides with
different functional groups like OH–, O–, and F– attached on their surface. The general
chemical formula of MXene is Mn+1XnTx, where M is the
transition metal like titanium, X is carbon, and Tx are the termination groups like OH–,
O–, and F–.24−28 Importantly, there are no reports yet on the doped
BFO/MXene nanohybrid, which may be an interesting material candidate
for photocatalysis. Keeping this in mind, we have successfully synthesized
hybrid samples consisting of Gd3+- and Sn4+-codoped
BFO nanoparticles with Ti3C2 MXene with varying
Sn4+ concentrations. The photocatalytic activity of this
hybrid for a colored dye (Congo red) is studied under visible light
irradiation. The 2D material-based nanohybrids provide a large surface
area, narrow band gap, and conductive pathways for charge carriers,
resulting in a decrease in the electron–hole recombination,
thus becoming promising candidates for photocatalysis application.
On the other hand, the gadolinium (Gd3+)- and tin (Sn4+)-doped bismuth ferrite nanoparticles play an important role
in photocatalytic activity due to the mesoporous nature, direct-band-gap
semiconductor nature, low
band gap, visible-light-active nature, large generation of charge
carriers, and long electron–hole recombination time.29 This work is novel because of its good photocatalytic
results, use of new material combination, and excellent catalytic
performance. The highest degradation of Congo red dye reported here
makes the Gadolinium (Gd3+)- and Tin (Sn4+)-doped
BFO/MXene nanohybrid an excellent photocatalyst under visible light.

2 Experimental Details
2.1 Materials
Bismuth
nitrate pentahydrate
(99% pure), iron nitrate nonhydrate (98.5% pure), gadolinium nitrate hexahydrate (99.9% pure), and tin
powder were used as reactants. Acetic acid (99.5%) was used as a catalyst,
and ethylene glycol (99%) was used as a solvent and reducing agent.
Hydrofluoric acid (39%) was used for etching of Ti3AlC2 MAX powder.

2.2 Synthesis of MXene
For the synthesis
of MXene, 10 grams of MAX powder was dispersed in 200 mL of (39%)
concentrated hydrofluoric acid in a Teflon bottle. The MAX powder
and hydrofluoric acid were mixed together at room temperature through
magnetic stirring for up to 36 h. After that, the hot plate was turned
off and the solution was left as is for 12 h. The solution was further
stirred for 12 h. Finally, the obtained etched powder was washed many
times with deionized water and was filtered through the filter paper
(Whatman 0.2 mm). The filtrate was dried at 50 °C overnight in
a drying oven. The obtained powder was the etched MXene used for fabrication
of nanohybrids.52,53

2.3 Synthesis
of Gd- and Sn-Codoped BFO Nanoparticles
The Gd3+- and Sn4+-codoped BFO nanoparticles
(general formula: Bi1–xGdxFe1–ySnyO3 (x = 0.0, 0.01; y = 0.0, 0.05, 0.10), abbreviated as BGFSO) were prepared
by the sol–gel technique. The bismuth nitrate pentahydrate
(Bi(NO3)3·5H2O) and gadolinium
nitrate hexahydrate (Gd(NO3)3·6H2O) powders were added to acetic acid and ethylene glycol used as
a solvent solution with a stoichiometric ratio of 1:1 and stirred
for 90 min at room temperature. Meanwhile, iron nitrate along with
Tin powders was also mixed with acetic acid and stirred for 1.5 h.
Then, both these separate solutions were mixed together and were put
on a hot plate for 3 h under stirring. A homogeneous reddish-brown
solution was obtained, which was dried overnight in a drying oven
at 50 °C and further calcined in a hot furnace at a temperature
of 600 °C for 3 h.11

2.4 Synthesis of MXene Nanohybrids
The
nanohybrids of doped BFO with MXene were synthesized using the coprecipitation
method. The solution of MXene was prepared in deionized water and
sonicated for 10 min. On the other hand, the Sn4+- and
Gd3+-doped Bismuth Ferrite nanoparticles (Bi1–xGdxFe1–ySny: BGFSO) were added
into the solution of acetic acid and ethylene glycol in a ratio of
1:1, molarity of 0.01 M. The prepared solution was sonicated for 2
h at 60 °C. After that, both the solutions were mixed together
and stirred for 1 h at 80 °C. The prepared solution was rinsed
several times with deionized water and was put in a drying oven at
50 °C for 24 h.

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Structural Analysis of Doped BFO Nanoparticles
and Nanohybrids
Figure 1a shows the X-ray diffraction (XRD) results of the
etched MAX powder known as MXene. The main peaks of MAX are at angles
of 9.7 and 19.1° having the (002) and (004) planes, respectively.52,53 However, the peaks after etching of aluminum are shifted toward
lower angles, i.e., at 9.6 and 18.6° having the (002) and (004)
planes, respectively. This peak shift toward a lower angle shows an
increase in the interplanar distance. The peak intensity of MXene
decreases sharply, which indicates the loss of crystalline nature
of the MAX powder after aluminum etching as compared to that of the
pure unetched MAX compound.28,29,52,53 The peaks corresponding to the
(101) and (105) planes are associated with TiC that might have formed
during the formation of MAX as well as during the synthesis of MXene.
The XRD patterns of the nanohybrids of Bi0.90Gd0.10Fe0.95Sn0.05 (BGFO-5Sn)/MXene, Bi0.90Gd0.10Fe0.90Sn0.10 (BGFO-10Sn)/MXene,
Bi0.90Gd0.10Fe0.85Sn0.15 (BGFO-15Sn)/MXene, and Bi0.90Gd0.10Fe0.80Sn0.20 (BGFO-20Sn)/MXene prepared by the coprecipitation
method are shown in Figure 1b.

Figure 1 XRD spectra of (a) MXene (Ti3C2Tx) and (b) Bi1–xGdxFe1–ySny (BGFSO)/MXene hybrid samples.

All of the peaks of the doped
BFO/MXene nanohybrid are labeled
with their corresponding (hkl) planes according to
the JCPDS card no 20-0169. The pure BFO has a rhombohedral distorted
perovskite structure with the R3c space group at room temperature. With the addition of Sn4+ to BFO nanoparticles, the doublet peaks corresponding to the (104)
and (110) planes are merged
into a single sharp peak, indicating the transformation of structure
from rhombohedral to orthorhombic because of difference in the ionic
radii of Sn4+ (1.09 A°) and Fe3+ (0.78
A°) that causes a distortion in the crystal lattice, resulting
in the expansion of unit cell volume. With an increase in the doping
concentration of Sn4+ up to 20%, the peak is shifted toward
the lower angle side. This indicates an increase in the interplanar
distance and lattice constant because of the replacement of the atom
of smaller ionic radii with the atom of larger ionic radii, which
produces a tensile stress in the crystal lattice and thus changes
the bond length of the unit cell.9,11 The average
crystallite size of prepared nanoparticles ranges from 60 to 20 nm.
The dopant atoms that do not move onto the substitutional sites generate
crystallinity loss inside the crystal structure and decrease the particle
size and are also responsible for broadening of the peaks. The sharp
peaks show the crystalline nature of the prepared material. The intensity
of the impurity peak of Bi2Fe4O9 increases
with the increase in doping concentration.11,54 However, the average crystallite sizes of Bi0.90Gd0.10Fe0.95Sn0.05 (BGFO-5Sn)/MXene, Bi0.90Gd0.10Fe0.90Sn0.10 (BGFO-10Sn)/MXene,
Bi0.90Gd0.10Fe0.85Sn0.15 (BGFO-15Sn)/MXene, and Bi0.90Gd0.10Fe0.80Sn0.20 (BGFO-20Sn)/MXene nanohybrids are calculated
by Scherer’s formula (D = Kλ/β cos θ), and they are found to
be 19.72, 21.54, 20.8, and 20.96 nm, respectively. From XRD of hybrid
samples, it is clear that the peaks are broadened and have lower intensity
due to the presence of etched MXene sheets with doped BFO nanoparticles.29−32 All of the main peaks of BFO and MXene are present in all hybrid
samples, and this is a clear evidence of the successful formation
of the hybrid.

3.2 Morphological Analysis
A scanning
electron microscope (SEM) was used to study the surface morphology
of prepared nanohybrids, as shown in Figure 2. It can be seen that the MXene sheets are
layered structures that are flat and smooth with sharp edges (Figure 2a,b), whereas Gd3+- and Sn4+-codoped BFO nanoparticles are dispersed
and attached on the surface of MXene sheets, as shown in Figure 2c–g. The attachment
of doped BFO nanoparticles on MXene sheets indicates a hybrid formation.
However, with the increasing concentration of Sn4+ (5,
10, 15, 20%) in BFO, the metallic nanoparticles agglomerate with each
other.

Figure 2 (a, b) Surface morphology of MXene sheets and (c, d) morphology
of Bi1–xGdxFe1–ySny (BGFSO)/MXene hybrid samples.

As a result of agglomeration, lesser number of doped BFO
nanoparticles
are attached onto the MXene sheets while the agglomerated nanoparticles
appear in the form of white clusters, as shown in Figure 2c,d. Agglomeration occurs due
to the large surface interaction of particles because of a decrease
in their size upon doping. Hence, agglomeration of nanoparticles reduces
the surface area, making the trapping sites available for dye degradation;
thus, it strongly influences the photocatalytic activity.30,31

3.3 X-ray Photoelectron (XPS) Spectrum
The
XPS spectra provide information about the chemical composition
and binding energy of various elements present in the Bi1–xGdxFe1–ySny (BGFSO)/MXene nanohybrid. Figure 3 shows XPS analysis
of the prepared nanohybrid. The survey spectrum of BGFSO/MXene shown
in Figure 3a contains
the elemental peaks of Bi, Fe, O, Gd, Sn, Ti, and C present in Bi1–xGdxFe1–ySny (BGFSO)/MXene
nanohybrids. The two intense peaks of Bi3+ corresponding
to binding energies of 158.8 and 163.9 eV for Bi 4f7/2 and
Bi 4f5/2 are shown in Figure 3b.

Figure 3 XPS analysis: (a) survey spectrum of Bi1–xGdxFe1–ySny (BGFSO)/MXene
hybrid samples,
(b) Bi 4f core levels, (c) Fe 2p core levels, (d) O 1s core levels,
(e) Gd 4d core levels, (f) Sn 3d core levels, (g) Ti 2p core levels,
and (h) C 1s core levels.

The peaks positioned at 710 and 716 eV reveal Fe3+ oxidation
states, and the peak at 724 eV corresponds to Fe2O3 (iron oxide) (Figure 3c). The peak at the binding energy of 532 eV corresponds to
the O 1s spectrum of the Bi1–xGdxFe1–ySny (BGFSO)/MXene nanohybrid. This peak arises
due to the absorbed oxygen atoms into the solution from the atmosphere,
as shown in Figure 3d. The spectrum of C 1s at the binding energy of 284.8 eV indicates
the C–O bonding. Also, there is no existence of C–Fe
and C–C emission peaks in Figure 3h.32 The peak
at 464 eV demonstrates the presence of Ti–O bonding, and the
peak at 459 eV corresponds to the Ti4+ oxidation state
that is described in Figure 3g.30,34,35,52,53 The intense
peak located at the binding energy of 494 eV is the 3d3/2 state of Sn4+, whereas the two small peaks of Gd3+ at binding energies of 158 eV and 164 eV correspond to 3d3/2 and 3d5/2 states, respectively, as shown in Figure 3e,f.9 From XPS results, it can be predicted that the atoms in
the prepared hybrid samples do not show a chemical bonding, i.e.,
ionic and covalent bonds and hence no chemical shift takes place during
hybrid formation.

3.4 Optical Properties of Nanohybrid
The optical properties of hybrid samples are investigated using
a
UV–visible spectrophotometer. The absorbance spectra of pure
MXene, Bi0.90Gd0.10Fe0.85Sn0.15 (BGFO-15Sn)/MXene, and Bi0.90Gd0.10Fe0.80Sn0.20 (BGFO-20Sn)/MXene hybrids show the absorbance
of light in the visible region (400–800 nm), as can be seen
in Figure 4a, which
is a clear indication that the pure MXene and doped Bi1–xGdxFe1–ySny (BGFSO) hybrid samples
continuously absorb light. Hence, there is no absorption edge originating
in pure MXene and doped BFO/MXene hybrid samples due to the metallic
properties of MXene that arise because of partial etching of aluminum
from MAX powder.52,55 Moreover, the atoms of Bi, Fe,
and O do not penetrate into MXene sheets as they just undergo surface
adsorption phenomena on MXene; as a result, there is no absorption
edge in hybrid samples because of the metallic nature of MXene.55 The band gap of MXene, Bi0.90Gd0.10Fe0.85Sn0.15 (BGFO-15Sn)/MXene, and
Bi0.90Gd0.10Fe0.80Sn0.20 (BGFO-20Sn)/MXene hybrid samples was calculated using Tauc’s
plot 1  whereas A is a constant, h is Planck’s constant, ν is the frequency
of irradiated light, Eg is the band gap
energy, and α is the absorbance of light.33 The band gap of hybrid samples was obtained by plotting
(αhν)2 against band gap energy Eg.34−3834−38 The band gaps of Bi0.90Gd0.10Fe0.85Sn0.15 (BGFO-15Sn)/MXene and Bi0.90Gd0.10Fe0.80Sn0.20 (BGFO-20Sn)/MXene were found to
be 1.6 and 1.4 eV, respectively, as shown in Figure 4.36,39 This reduction in the
band gap of hybrid samples was observed due to the incorporation of
stacked and porous MXene sheets into doped BFO nanoparticles, which
develop intermediate states between the conduction band (CB) and the
valence band (VB) of doped BFO nanoparticles across the interface,
which causes reduction in the band gap.11,37,38,40,52,53

Figure 4 (a) Absorbance and band gap of pure MXene,
Bi0.90Gd0.10Fe0.80Sn0.20 (BGFO-20Sn)/MXene, and
Bi0.90Gd0.10Fe0.85Sn0.15 (BGFO-15Sn)/MXene nanohybrid samples. (b) Photoluminescence (PL)
spectra of BFO, Bi0.90Gd0.10Fe0.95Sn0.05 (BGFO-5Sn)/MXene, Bi0.90Gd0.10Fe0.90Sn0.10 (BGFO-10Sn)/MXene, Bi0.90Gd0.10Fe0.85Sn0.15 (BGFO-15Sn)/MXene,
and Bi0.90Gd0.10Fe0.80Sn0.20 (BGFO-20Sn)/MXene.

3.5 Photoluminescence Emission Spectrum
Photoluminescence (PL) emission spectrum was used to determine the
electron–hole recombination rate. The photoluminescence spectra
contain a central peak at 426 nm and a shoulder peak at 458 nm. The
shoulder peak originates due to the presence of defects and impurity
energy levels in the prepared samples.44−47 These defects arise in the hybrid
samples due to the partial etching of aluminum from the MAX powder
and may also appear during doping BFO by Gd3+ and Sn4+ elements.11 The central peak
appearing at 426 nm shows the recombination rate of charge carriers;
the greater the electron–hole recombination rate, the greater
the PL peak intensity and vice versa.41−46Figure 4b shows the
PL emission spectra of doped BFO/MXene hybrid samples. The Bi0.90Gd0.10Fe0.80Sn0.20 (BGFO-20Sn)/MXene
and Bi0.90Gd0.10Fe0.85Sn0.15 (BGFO-15Sn)/MXene samples have small PL peak intensities that correspond
to a lower electron–hole recombination rate than that for BFO/MXene,
Bi0.90Gd0.10Fe0.95Sn0.05 (BGFO-5Sn)/MXene, and Bi0.90Gd0.10Fe0.90Sn0.10 (BGFO-10Sn)/MXene. This is because of the porous
2D MXene sheets that trap the electrons and enhance the electron–hole
separation. The lower recombination of charge carriers provides efficient
dye degradation and thus enhances the photocatalytic activity.47,48

3.6 Photocatalytic Activity
The photocatalytic
activity of doped BFO hybrid samples for degradation of Congo red is shown
in Figure 5. For this
purpose, two experiments were performed in dark and light. In the
dark experiment, Congo red was added into the catalytic solution under
no light. As a result, no dye degradation takes place because of no
generation of charge carriers i.e., electrons and holes. The dark
effect is significant and is due to adsorption, which is unavoidable.
The experiment that took place under light plays an important role
in dye degradation because of the formation of charge carriers.

Bi0.90Gd0.10Fe0.85Sn0.15 (BGFO-15Sn)/MXene, and Bi0.90Gd0.10Fe0.80Sn0.20 (BGFO-20Sn)/MXene. (f) Photocatalytic
degradation of pure MXene, Bi0.90Gd0.10Fe0.95Sn0.05 (BGFO-5Sn)/MXene, Bi0.90Gd0.10Fe0.90Sn0.10 (BGFO-10Sn)/MXene, Bi0.90Gd0.10Fe0.85Sn0.15 (BGFO-15Sn)/MXene,
and Bi0.90Gd0.10Fe0.80Sn0.20 (BGFO-20Sn)/MXene.

In the light experiment, 100 mg of hybrid samples (catalyst)
was
added into the Congo red dye solution (100 mL). A Xenon lamp having
a power of 300 W was used as a visible light source for a wavelength
range of 400–700 nm. During the experiment, the solution was
stirred continuously so that the sample and the dye molecules mixed
equally into the water. Then, 5 mL solution was taken out after every
30 min and was centrifuged to check for supernatant by a UV–vis
spectrometer to analyze dye degradation from the solution. Meanwhile,
the degradation of dye can also be observed by discharge of color
from the catalytic solution. This discharge of dye color is because
of the breakdown of the azo bonds between the dye molecules. The dye
degradation efficiency can be determined using the following equation 2  whereas Co is
the initial concentration of dye solution and C is
the concentration of dye solution at any time t.11,45,47,49−51 The absorbance
spectra of all of the hybrid samples and pure MXene are shown in Figure 5a–e The absorbance
spectra of pure MXene at different times indicate the concentration
of Congo red dye as well as its degradation efficiency from the catalytic
solution.11 The MXene sheets are black,
indicating that the sheets absorb all types of radiation (UV, vis,
and NIR). The red peak at high intensity shows the highest concentration
of dye molecules into the solution. As the time goes on, the concentration
of dye molecules decreases; hence, less light absorption takes place
due to less interaction of it with molecules and a decrease in the
absorption peak intensity occurs with time.60 The decrease in the intensity
of absorbance peak with time is a clear evidence of dye degradation
from the catalytic solution. However, in the case of pure MXene catalyst,
after 30 min, the absorbance peak is shifted toward the longer-wavelength
region because of the attachment of a large number of oxygen atoms
onto the MXene surface that oxidizes the sheets as Ti3C2O2.56−59 The peak that is shifted at above 500 nm may be due to the presence
of dye molecules that are smaller in size and require less amount
of energy for transitions to higher energy levels, so the lesser the
energy, the higher the wavelength, and this is the reason for peak
shift.60,61

The absorbance of dye over the catalyst
surface is strongly related
to the degradation rate of Congo red dye from the photocatalytic solution.
From Figure 5f, it
can be observed that the black line corresponds to the degradation
of Congo red from solution without light irradiation. Moreover, 80%
Congo red dye is degraded from the pure MXene solution in 120 min,
which is a clear evidence that the MXene sheet has a good photocatalytic
activity due to its larger surface area and porous nature. Bi0.90Gd0.10Fe0.95Sn0.05 (BGFO-5Sn)/MXene
degraded 38% of dye solution, whereas 18% dye degradation took place
from Bi0.90Gd0.10Fe0.90Sn0.10 (BGFO-10Sn)/MXene and Bi0.90Gd0.10Fe0.85Sn0.15 (BGFO-15Sn)/MXene in 120 min. Bi0.90Gd0.10Fe0.80Sn0.20 (BGFO-20Sn)/MXene
is a good photocatalyst because of 100% dye degradation in 120 min.
This shows that the doped BFO/MXene hybrid samples have a good photocatalytic
activity in the presence of light rather than under dark conditions.

Here, of all of the prepared hybrid samples, the Bi0.90Gd0.10Fe0.80Sn0.20 (BGFO-20Sn)/MXene
hybrid sample is the best photocatalyst due to its small average particle size (19 nm)
as well as its band gap being tuned to 1.5 eV and low electron–hole
recombination rate as compared to those for other counterparts. The
tuned band gap and low electron–hole recombination are due
to the incorporation of MXene sheets into the doped BFO nanoparticles.
Because of the porous nature and large surface area, MXene sheets
trap the charges and enhance the separation of charges, i.e., holes
and electrons.55 On the other hand, because
of the mesoporous nature, BGFO-20Sn also traps a large number of dye
molecules as the sizes of doped BFO nanoparticles and Congo red dye
molecules are comparable, which enhances their degradation activity.
At a higher doping concentration, the enhanced photocatalytic activity
is also because of the large number of active sites available on the
photocatalyst surface that are produced due to the presence of a large
number of defects. These defects make the material more reactive to
the charge carriers and the functional groups (OH–, F–, O–) attached on MXene thus
produce radicals that further help in promoting dye degradation.11,29,32,52,55

Another factor that helps faster degradation
of dye is the pH of
the Bi0.90Gd0.10Fe0.80Sn0.20 (BGFO-20Sn)/MXene hybrid sample as well as the pure MXene sample.
The pH of the Bi0.90Gd0.10Fe0.80Sn0.20 (BGFO-20Sn)/MXene sample was 2, whereas the pH of the
pure MXene sample was 3. The greater the pH of the solution, the greater
the concentration of H+ ions in the solution and so the
higher the positive charges on the catalyst surface as the dye molecules
carry a negative charge because of the presence of functional groups.
Thus, more electrostatic attraction develops between them. As a result,
more adsorption of dye molecules occurs on the photocatalyst surface.
Therefore, the greater the adsorption of dye molecules, the larger
the degradation.53−57 Moreover, the pH of the MXene solution is 3; thus, the concentration
of H+ molecules will be lesser in the solution, which indicates
less positive charge on the catalyst surface and less electrostatic
interaction between the catalyst and dye molecules. Hence, the degradation
rate of Congo red will be lower in the case of pure MXene than in
Bi0.90Gd0.10Fe0.80Sn0.20 (BGFO-20Sn)/MXene.53,55,56

3.7 Proposed Photocatalytic Mechanism
The mechanism
of photocatalysis is based on the oxidation and reduction
reactions occurred on the nanohybrid surface in the presence of electrons
and holes. The electrons and holes are generated due to the interaction
of visible light with the catalyst surface, which produces radical
ions. When electrons undergo the reduction reaction with oxygen and
holes undergo the oxidation reaction with water, the OH– and O2– radicals are produced. These
radicals are highly reactive species for the degradation of Congo
red dye from water and give harmless end products like CO2 and H2O.

These harmless products can further be
reduced to get hydrocarbons like methane, etc. Figure 6 shows the proposed photocatalytic mechanism
for dye degradation. Charge generation takes place when light interacts
with the catalyst surface (eq 3). MXene sheets act as acceptors as they trap electrons and enhance the separation
of charge carriers (eq 4). Electrons react with adsorbed oxygen, O2, to undergo
the reduction reaction and convert oxides into superoxide radicals,
O2–; holes react with water molecules
and are oxidized into hydroxyl radical ions, OH– (eqs 5 and 6). These species react with Congo red dye and degrade
it from the catalytic solution to give harmless end products like
H2O and CO2.45,46,61

Figure 6 Doped BFO/MXene nanohybrid Congo red (CR) dye degradation
mechanism.

The proposed photocatalytic degradation
mechanism is expressed
by the following equations45,61 3   4   5   6   7   8  It can be seen
that Bi0.90Gd0.10Fe0.80Sn0.20 (BGFO-20Sn)/MXene is
a good photocatalyst. The enhanced photocatalytic activity is because
of the short electron–hole recombination time, low band gap
(1.4 eV), and small crystallite size as compared to those for other
nanohybrid samples. The low band gap is because of gadolinium (Gd3+) and tin (Sn4+) doping that further generates
more number of electrons and holes and thus more production of OH– and O2– radicals by oxidation
and reduction reactions, respectively. Hence, more production of OH– and O2– radicals allow
more degradation of organic pollutants from water.61

4 Conclusions
The
Bi1–xGdxFe1–ySny (BGFSO)/MXene nanohybrids were synthesized by the coprecipitation
method. The XRD and SEM results clearly indicate the formation of
Bi1–xGdxFe1–ySny (BGFSO)/MXene nanohybrids. The incorporation of MXene sheets into
BGFSO nanoparticles reduces their band gap due to the porous nature
of MXene sheets that helps trap the charge particles and reduce their
recombination rate. The band gap of nanohybrids is also reduced due
to the conducting nature of the 2D MXene surface. The XPS results
also indicate successful formation of the nanohybrid rather than their
chemical interaction. The degradation rate of Congo red dye from the
catalytic solution is higher in the case of Bi0.90Gd0.10Fe0.80Sn0.20 (BGFO-20Sn)/MXene, showing 100% degradation of dye
from the catalytic solution, than that for Bi0.90Gd0.10Fe0.95Sn0.05 (BGFO-5Sn)/MXene, showing
38% degradation along with 18% dye degradation for Bi0.90Gd0.10Fe0.90Sn0.10 (BGFO-10Sn)/MXene
and Bi0.90Gd0.10Fe0.85Sn0.15 (BGFO-15Sn)/MXene. The good photocatalytic result of Bi0.90Gd0.10Fe0.80Sn0.20 (BGFO-20Sn)/MXene
was due to the small crystallite size (19 nm), which is attributed
to the higher surface area and low band gap. The present catalyst
is reported for the first time with the highest (100%) dye-degradation
efficiency in 2 h at room temperature, fabricated using a simple and
cost-effective route and thus is suitable for industrial application.
