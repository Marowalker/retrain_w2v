We investigated the selectivity of
N-doped graphene nanoclusters
(N-GNCs) toward the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) using first-principles
calculations within the density functional theory. The results show that the maximum electrode
potentials (UMax) for the four-electron
(4e–) pathway are higher than those for the two-electron
(2e–) pathway at almost all of the reaction sites.
Thus, the N-GNCs exhibit high selectivity for the 4e– pathway, that is, the 4e– reduction proceeds preferentially
over the 2e– reduction. Such high selectivity results
in high durability of the catalyst because H2O2, which corrodes the electrocatalyst, is not generated. For the doping
sites near the edge of the cluster, the value of UMax greatly depends on the reaction sites. However, for
the doping sites around the center of the cluster, the reaction-site
dependence is hardly observed. The GNC with a nitrogen atom around
the center of the cluster exhibits higher ORR catalytic capability
compared with the GNC with a nitrogen atom in the vicinity of the
edge. The results also reveal that the water molecule generated by
the ORR enhances the selectivity toward the 4e– pathway
because the reaction intermediates are significantly stabilized by
water.

Introduction
Fuel cells have recently
attracted much attention as eco-friendly
energy systems. In a fuel cell, energy is obtained through an electrochemical
reaction of hydrogen fuel with oxygen. The main problem impeding the
widespread implementation of fuel cells is that the oxygen reduction
reaction (ORR) at the cathode is less efficient than the hydrogen
oxidation reaction at the anode. Currently, platinum-based materials
are being commonly used as effective catalysts for the ORR. However,
platinum-based materials have many problems, including high cost and
low durability. Therefore, a platinum-free catalyst with the high
ORR activity is required. N-doped graphene is expected to be one such
electrocatalyst materials. Recently, N-doped graphene has been experimentally
confirmed to exhibit high ORR activity.1−9 Although various aspects of the ORR mechanism have been proposed,
such as the type of C–N bonding, the presence of local active
sites, and the effects of edges, little consensus exists about the
mechanism that N-doped graphene follows to promote the ORR at the
atomic scale. Many researchers have suggested on the basis of experimentation
that the N-doped graphene containing pyridinic-N exhibits high ORR
activity.2−6 Wu et al. have reported that N-doped graphene can be synthesized
from g-C3N4 and have suggested that the pyridinic-N
tends to be the most active N functional group to facilitate ORR at
low overpotential.4 Zeng has suggested
that highly graphitized carbon with high contents of pyridinic-N and
graphitic-N at the edge exhibits higher ORR activity.6 With respect to the active site, a C atom adjacent to a
pyridinic-N can potentially function as an active site where an O2 molecule can be adsorbed in the initial step of the ORR.5 In contrast, Geng et al. have claimed that graphitic-N
species appear to play a predominant role in determining the ORR activity.9 Our previous calculations10 have also suggested that the graphitic-N is capable of
providing reaction sites for ORR.

To improve the electrocatalytic
performances of N-doped graphene,
increasing the number of active sites is critical. In this respect,
small graphene surrounded by edges, that is, graphene nanoclusters
(GNCs), have attracted much attention. High-symmetry GNCs with various
shapes and sizes have been fabricated experimentally.11−17 Because N atoms get preferentially doped at edges that exhibit high
chemical reactivity,18−21 numerous theoretical studies on the ORR activity at edges and defects
of N-doped graphene have been reported.22−28 The C atoms near the N atoms at the edge have been identified as
the ORR active sites.24−28 For example, Saidi has suggested that both pyridinic- and graphitic-N
are dominant active sites at the edge of the N-doped nanocarbons.28 Furthermore, the electronic structure near the
doped N atom has been suggested to drastically change depending on
the distance of the N atom from the edge.20,21,29 However, little attention has been devoted
to the dependence of the ORR activity on doping and active sites in
the vicinity of the edge.

In general, the ORR mainly proceeds
via two pathways: a two-electron
(2e–) pathway wherein O2 molecules are
reduced to hydrogen peroxides (H2O2) and a direct
four-electron (4e–) pathway wherein the final product
of the reaction is water.4,26,30−36 H2O2 generated by the 2e– reaction might corrode a carbon-based electrocatalyst causing poor
device durability. Thus, the 4e– pathway is more
desirable than the 2e– pathway; hence, selectivity
for the 4e– pathway is required for the carbon-based
catalyst. The discussion of reaction selectivity has thus far focused
on metal-based catalysts. The reaction selectivity on metal surfaces
strongly depends on the metals and their surface orientations,37 and it is dominated by the stability of reaction
intermediates adsorbed on the metal surface. However, the onset of
the reaction selectivity is not fully understood. The stability of
reaction intermediates has been suggested to be affected by environmental
water. For example, ORR intermediates have been demonstrated to be
stabilized by the environmental water on the surface of a Pt catalyst.38,39 For N-doped graphene, the stability of adsorbed O2 molecules
is strongly affected by environmental water.36 Further, it has also been reported that the ORR activity is strongly
influenced by water molecules generated by the ORR itself.40 However, the effects of water on the reaction
selectivity have not been clarified.

To comprehensively evaluate
the catalytic activity for ORR, it
is necessary to understand the reaction kinetics as well as thermodynamics.
However, in the first place, the thermodynamic properties of ORR should
be revealed before the reaction kinetics because a potential of the
ORR activity is governed by the thermodynamical stability for each
reaction process. In the present work, we use first-principles calculations
based on the density functional theory (DFT) to investigate the effects
of doping and reaction sites on the ORR activity of the N-doped graphene
nanoclusters (N-GNCs) in view of the thermodynamical selectivity for
the reaction pathway. We focus on the effect of the water molecule
generated by the reaction on the ORR activity. We show that high selectivity
toward the 4e– pathway is attained for GNCs with
N atoms located at the inner doping sites of the cluster rather than
at the edge sites. We also suggest that the water molecule plays a
critical role in the manifestation of the reaction selectivity.

Figure 1 shows the
model of the GNC, in which a C atom is substituted by a N atom. We
adopted the hexagonal N-GNCs with zigzag edges which have been fabricated
experimentally.17 The doping and the reaction
sites are denoted by numbers and letters, respectively (see Figure 1). We assumed that
the reaction sites are C atoms adjacent to the N atom, onto which
the reaction intermediates (O, OH, and OOH) for the ORR are adsorbed
(see Figure 2). We
define model “x–y”
as a model for doping site “x” and
reaction site “y”.

Results and Discussion
Figure 3 shows the
relative formation energies of the N-GNCs. The N atom preferentially
located at the edge, at sites 1 and 1′, rather than at the
inner site of the cluster, which agrees well with previous results.19−21 The edge-localized states41 on zigzag
edges strongly affect the doping stability as follows:21 for N-doping on the zigzag graphene nanoribbon
(GNR), the formation energy increased as a function of the distance
of N from the edge and two independent curves arose for odd- and even-numbered
sites. Because the wave function of the edge state has amplitude only
at odd-numbered sites, only the N 2pz orbital
at odd-numbered sites can resonate with the edge state. As a result,
the eigenvalue of the edge state for the odd-numbered-site doping
became lower than that for the even-numbered-site doping. For GNCs,
the edge states apparently emerged at the edges of GNCs larger than
C96H24.29 For our
model (C96H24), the number of edge atoms was
too small to clearly produce the localized state at the edge. Therefore,
such an odd–even trend in the formation energy was not observed
distinctly in our cluster model.

Figure 3 Relative formation energy of the H-terminated
N-GNC for each doping
site. The total energy for site 1 is set to be zero.

As evident in Figure 3, the N atom was preferentially located at
site 1′ rather
than at site 1. N atoms have been reported to preferentially locate
at the zigzag edges rather than at armchair edges.20 Site 1′ was deemed to be a pure zigzag edge, whereas
site 1 was regarded as either the side or the corner of the cluster—namely,
zigzag as well as armchair edges. Therefore, site 1′ became
more stable than site 1. In this study, each N atom located at site
1 or 1′ was terminated by a H atom, despite the apparent improbability
of such an arrangement. The N atom of a pyridine molecule is rarely
accompanied by a H atom because the N atom of pyridine has a stable
lone pair of electrons. However, the N atom at the zigzag edge preferred
to be hydrogenated, maintaining the planar C–N–C structure.
The formation of a stable N–H bond at the zigzag edge of GNR
corroborated the charge-transfer model:21 if the extra electron transfers to the edge state, one of the electrons
of N contributes to the formation of the covalent bonding between
N and H, and then the π-conjugated network near the edge is
preserved even with N-doping. The stability of the N–H bond
for N-GNC cannot be discussed the same way as that of the N–H
bond for GNR because the edge state hardly emerged in our (C96H24) model. In fact, at doping site 1, the pyridinic-N
was more stable than N terminated by a H atom. The quantitative stability
of the N–H bond was shown in the Supporting Information.

In the present work, the value of UMax with respect to a standard hydrogen electrode
(SHE) and the reaction
selectivity were evaluated using free-energy diagrams. Figure 4 shows the free-energy diagrams
for model 7-f as an example. In these diagrams, the free energies
of the ORR intermediates are plotted from O2 toward the
final product of the ORR at zero-cell potential (U = 0 V), the equilibrium potential (Ueq), and the maximum potential (UMax),
wherein all reaction steps are exothermic. At U =
0 V, the diagram for the 4e– pathway becomes downhill:
all of the reactions spontaneously proceed toward the generation of
H2O. The UMax calculated for
the 4e– pathway is 0.68 V. By contrast, for the
2e– pathway, the diagram becomes uphill from the
OOH adsorption to the H2O2 generation at U = 0 V, which causes a negative value of UMax (−0.13 V). Thus, the ORR for the 2e– pathway stops at the OOH adsorption step, and H2O2 generation is thereby suppressed. All of the corresponding
reaction diagrams are shown in the Supporting Information.

Figure 4 Free-energy diagrams of the model 7-f under acidic conditions
(a)
for the 4e– pathway at zero cell potential (U = 0 V), the equilibrium potential (Ueq = 1.23 V), and the maximum potential (UMax = +0.68 V) wherein all reaction steps are exothermic
and (b) for the 2e– pathway at U = 0 V, Ueq = 0.68 V, and UMax = −0.13 V.

We evaluated the ORR activity of the N-GNC for each doping
site
and reaction site by estimating UMax in
terms of the output voltage or the durability, that is, the reaction
selectivity, of fuel cells. Figure 5 shows the variation of UMax depending on the doping and the reaction sites. The UMax for the 4e– pathway is higher than
that for the 2e– one for each doping and each reaction
site except for the 1-b, pyridinic 1-b, and 2-a models. The highest UMax for the 4e– pathway for
any doping sites is ≈0.7–0.8 V, comparable to that for
platinum (UMax = 0.9 V42). Although the values of UMax are greatly scattered near the edge, the reaction site variation
of UMax is reduced for the doping sites
inside the cluster (≥site 3). The average UMax for inner doping sites (≥site 3) of the clusters
is 0.76 and 0.01 V for the 4e– and the 2e– pathways (see dashed and dotted lines in Figure 5), respectively. Notably, the values of UMax for the 2e– pathway are
approximately negative numbers except for those corresponding to doping
at the edge. When UMax becomes negative,
the reaction does not occur unless the reverse voltage is applied.
Thus, the N-GNCs have high selectivity for the 4e– pathway, that is, the ORR via the 4e– pathway
proceeds preferentially. However, for the doping sites in the vicinity
of the edge (<site 3), the values of UMax depend strongly on the reaction sites. For example, for the model
1-a″, the UMax for the 4e– pathway becomes a negative value. In this case, the ORR is aborted
at the OH adsorption step, and the reaction site then becomes inactive
for the ORR. Furthermore, for 1-b and 1′-b, the UMax values for the 2e– pathway are relatively
large and positive as compared with cases for deeper site doping.
In such cases, H2O2 molecules generated by the
2e– reaction corrode the electrocatalyst, resulting
in poor durability of the fuel cell. Hence, we conclude that high
capability for the ORR is more likely to be achieved via the doping
of N into a deeper site of the cluster.

Figure 5 UMax of the N-GNCs for the models.
The circles and the crosses show the UMax for the 4e– and the 2e– pathways,
respectively. The UMax for the pyridinic-N
models are indicated by the squares for the 4e– pathway
and by the plus marks for the 2e– pathway, respectively.
The dashed and dotted lines show averaged values of UMax over deeper doping sites (≥site 3) for the
4e– and the 2e– pathways, respectively.

The N-GNR has been reported to
exhibit high ORR activity in the
vicinity of the edge.27 In our results,
the N-GNC also shows a high UMax at the
edge sites (1′-b, 2-c, etc.). However, in the vicinity of the
edge (<site 3), the values of UMax depend
strongly on the reaction sites, and the selectivity for the 4e– reduction is low. Therefore, the ORR at the edge of
the N-GNC is undesirable from the viewpoint of achieving a stable
output and a durable fuel cell. Because N atoms thermodynamically
prefer to locate near the edges, fabricating N-GNCs containing N atoms
inside the clusters in a thermal equilibrium state would be experimentally
difficult. However, if the N-GNC containing N atoms inside the cluster
can be fabricated using nonequilibrium processes, such as a solution
plasma process,43 the N-GNC becomes an
epoch-making catalyst for the ORR.

UMax is determined by the relative
free energies of the intermediates, ΔGOOH, ΔGO, and ΔGOH. For the 4e– pathway, the
state of equilibrium between OH adsorption and H2O generation
dominates the value of UMax for almost
all of the models. Figure 6 shows the ΔG values for the models.
For inner doping sites (≥site 3) of the clusters, the ΔG values are almost the same, regardless of the reaction
site. By contrast, for the doping sites in the vicinity of the edge
(<site 3), ΔG varies depending on the reaction
site, which leads to a substantial dependence of UMax on the reaction site. Furthermore, for the pyridinic-N
models, the values of ΔG are higher than those
for the graphitic-N models, that is, each intermediate for the pyridinic-N
models is relatively unstable. When the reaction site is just at the
edge, ΔGOH becomes a negative value
for site 1-a″, 2-a′, and 2′-a′. This result
means that the reaction is aborted at the step of OH adsorption, and
that these reaction sites are then no longer active.

and ΔGOH values for the 4e– pathway, respectively. The circles represent ΔGOOH values for the 2e– pathway. The
free energies for pyridinic-N models are indicated by filled marks.
The dashed lines show the averaged ΔG values
for the reaction intermediates over deeper doping sites (≥site

reaction intermediates
for each doping site and reaction site. The squares, rhombuses, and
triangles represent ΔGW(OOH), ΔGW(O), and ΔGW(OH), respectively. The ΔGW for
pyridinic-N models are indicated by the filled marks.

We explicitly investigated the influence of water
(ΔGW) on the adsorption of a water
molecule onto
reaction intermediates to evaluate the ORR activity because the adsorption
energy of reaction intermediates is strongly affected by water. Hydrogen
bonding between a reaction intermediate and a water molecule stabilizes
the intermediates of the ORR. Water molecules have been reported to
affect the stability of the OOH and the OH adsorbed onto the surface
of the metal catalyst, whereas the adsorption energy of O has been
reported to be hardly affected by water.38 However, for the N-GNCs, the adsorbed O is stabilized by a water
molecule as well as the adsorption of OOH or OH. Figure 7 shows the ΔGW for all models. The values of ΔGW(OOH) and ΔGW(OH) are
approximately −0.5 and −0.4 eV, respectively. The value
of ΔGW(OOH) and ΔGW(OH) are roughly independent of the doping site. However,
ΔGW(O) in the vicinity of the edge
varies depending on the doping sites, whereas the values of ΔGW(O) for inner doping sites (≥site 4)
of the clusters are settled. As shown in Figure 8, the maximum electrode potentials without
the adsorption of a water molecule, denoted by the value of UMaxw/o for the 4e– pathway, are approximately the same
as UMax (Figure 5). However, the UMaxw/o for the 2e– pathways are substantially greater than the UMax; in addition, the UMaxw/o of the 4e– pathway is still greater than those for the 2e– pathway except for 2-a and 3-b. Thus, almost all models
show selectivity for the 4e– pathway (such as the
ORR with ΔGW). However, the UMaxw/o values of the 2e– pathway are positive and relatively
large values ≈0.5 V because the ΔGOOH, which dominates the maximum electrode potential for the
2e– pathway, increases in the absence of water.
As a result, the 2e– reduction as well as the 4e– reduction must proceed. Hence, the water plays an
important role in the onset of the reaction selectivity. It has been
reported that the removal of water molecules at the Pt-catalyst surface
enhances the reactivity of oxygen species.44 Furthermore, for Pt-based catalysts, water molecules have been reported
to corrode the catalyst and to substantially decrease the electrocatalytic
performance for the ORR.40 Therefore, to
improve the ORR activity of Pt-based catalysts, water molecules should
be removed in the reaction field. On the other hand, for the N-GNCs,
the water rather improves the reaction selectivity, resulting in high
durability of the fuel cell. This durability will be a great advantage
of N-GNCs over metal-based catalysts.

models are indicated by squares and the plus marks for the 4e– and the 2e– pathways, respectively.
The dashed and dotted lines show the average UMaxw/o for the 4e– and the 2e– pathways over deeper
doping sites (≥site 3), respectively.

Conclusions
The ORR activity for the hexagonal N-GNCs was
investigated. The
GNC with a nitrogen atom around the center of the cluster exhibits
a high UMax and high selectivity for the
4e– pathway, that is, it exhibits high durability.
For the doping sites near the edge, the value of UMax depends strongly on both the doping and the reaction
sites, resulting in low selectivity for the 4e– pathway.
However, for the doping sites inside the cluster, the lack of a significant
dependence of UMax on the doping and the
reaction sites is confirmed. Furthermore, we clarified that the reaction
intermediates are stabilized by the water molecule, resulting in high
selectivity for the 4e– reduction. This behavior
contrasts sharply with those of metal-based catalysts, where water
molecules corrode and substantially decrease its ORR electrocatalytic
performance.40 We concluded that from the
viewpoint of durability under a water environment, the N-GNC with
a N atom inside the cluster is a potential electrocatalyst for next-generation
fuel cells.

Computational Methods
For all DFT calculations, we
used the Gaussian 09 code45 employing the
hybrid B3LYP functional46,47 and the 6-31G (d,p)
basis set in this package. Structural optimization
with respect to ionic positions was performed until each component
of the interatomic force was <0.0003 Ha/bohr. The ORR for the 4e– pathway is ideally facilitated just below the equilibrium
potential (1.23 V). For the 4e– pathway, O2 is reduced to H2O through the intermediates OOH, O, and
OH. We considered the following associative mechanism 1  where “*” denotes
that the ORR
intermediates are adsorbed onto the surface of the catalyst. The ORR
for the 2e– pathway is ideally facilitated just
below the equilibrium potential (0.68 V). For the 2e– pathway, O2 molecules are reduced to H2O2 through the intermediate of OOH. An associative mechanism
was also considered for the 2e– pathway 2  

For the 2e– pathway, the process of H2O2 reduction is excluded because a H2O2 molecule is desorbed from the N-GNC without an activation
barrier. The electrocatalytic activities for the 4e– and 2e– reductions are dominated by the stability
of adsorption of the intermediates OOH, O, and OH.

The ORR electrocatalytic
activities were evaluated on the basis
of the computational hydrogen electrode model proposed by Nørskov.48 The chemical potential for (H+ +
e–) is equivalent to that of 1/2H2 in
the gas phase with the SHE. We considered the free-energy difference
(ΔG) of the ORR processes with a pressure of
1 bar, pH = 0, and T = 298 K.

The ΔG was constructed as follows 3  where ΔG0 is the Gibbs free energy, ΔGU corresponds
to the electrode potential, ΔGpH represents the effect of the solvent, ΔGW is the stabilization energy by water, and ΔGfield is the effect of the local electric field
at the electrode. The ΔG0 was calculated
considering the following terms 4  where
ΔE is the energy
difference between reaction intermediates and final products and ΔZPE and TΔS means
the zero-point energy and the entropy, respectively. ΔZPE and TΔS were
computed by the vibrational frequency calculation. Here, ΔE values were calculated for the 4e– pathway 5  and for the 2e– pathway 6  

We assumed
that ΔGW is the stabilization
energy by a water molecule. Here, we optimized the hydrogen-bonding
configuration between each reaction intermediate and a water molecule
for all models. Typical values of ΔGW are −0.49 (OOH), −0.52 (O), and −0.39 eV (OH)
for the model 7-g′, which agree well with the results for the
effect of several water layers, −0.49 (OOH), −0.53 (O),
and −0.42 eV (OH),36 respectively.
We set ΔGpH = 0, that is, the acidic
condition (pH = 0). We ignored the term ΔGfield because the absolute value of ΔGfield was estimated to be very small (≈10–2 eV).49 By changing ΔGU, we estimated the maximum electrode potential (UMax) wherein all reaction steps are exothermic
for the 4e– and the 2e– pathways.
