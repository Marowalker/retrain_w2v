Orthorhombic phase
bismuth sulfide (Bi2S3) nanobelts were prepared
via  liquid–solid phase reaction
method. Bi2S3 nanobelts were observed to be
preferentially oriented along the (101) plane. Direct band gap (2.95
eV) and characteristic wavelength (λmax = 342 nm)
were extracted through UV–visible spectroscopy. Specific surface
area (9.8 m2/g) and pore size (2.5–120 nm) were
evaluated through Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) analysis.
Relative humidity (RH) sensing properties were studied in the range
of 11–97% RH at ambient conditions. The response of the sensor
increases linearly with increase in RH. Fast response time (8–10
s) and recovery time (15 s) were observed. Reproducible and large
response was also observed between 11 and 97% RH. Small hysteresis
(<5%) and long-term stability during 30 days were confirmed. As
a function of frequency, capacitance, alternating current conductivity,
and electrical complex modulus in the frequency range of 20–2
MHz were studied at 11–97% RH. The sensing mechanism was also
studied.

1 Introduction
Most important physical
quantity among the measurable physical
quantities is RH. Measurement and control of humidity (water
vapors) in industries, textiles, electronics, pharmaceuticals, processing
of chemicals, food, and laboratory work is very important. Also in
semiconductor industry, the control of humidity is very important
for the manufacture of extremely refined integrated circuits.1 To have a healthy surrounding, it is fundamental
to screen, identify, and control the surrounding humidity by advance
humidity sensors.2,3 Therefore, the requirements for
healthy environmental conditions have prompted the advancements in
humidity sensors by the utilization of chemical and physical characteristics
of hybrid, inorganic, or organic materials.4 Advancement in humidity sensory systems involves the improvement
of transducer performance, for example, principle of mechanism, structure
design, fabrication technologies,5 and
sensing elements.6

Humidity sensor-producing
technologies are driven by modern signal-conditioning
techniques;7 fast postprocess, low-cost,
and low-power micro- and nanoelectronic hybrid circuits;1,8,9 and improvements in miniaturization
technologies.10,11 The requirement for product reliability
and enhancement of quality are essential for commercial competiveness.
Besides, it is vital to know the level of effectiveness of every sensor
identified with its sensing mechanism and calibration circumstances.12 Scaling down of sensor devices offers various
points of interest, for example, batch fabrication, low hysteresis,13 and integration/packaging alongside the reductions14,15 in cost.

For miniaturization of sensor devices, nanostructured
materials
play a key role due to their high surface-to-volume ratio, small size,
and unique photoelectric, chemical, and sensing properties.16,17 To date, assortment of one-dimensional nanostructured solar cells,
ultraviolet detectors, transistors, and chemical sensors has been
reported.16 One-dimensional metal sulfide/oxide
nanostructures have gained much consideration due to their exceptional
properties.17,18 Among them, Bi2S3 with direct band gap (1.3 eV) finds several applications
in humidity sensors,18 gas sensors,19 infrared spectroscopy, optoelectronic devices,
electronic devices, and thermoelectric devices.20 For the synthesis of Bi2S3 nanostructures,
different methods have been used, for example, solvothermal/hydrothermal,21,22 microwave irradiation,23 and chemical
deposition.24 However, these synthesis
processes are complicated with a low production yield. In this paper,
we used a liquid–solid phase reaction method to produce crystalline
Bi2S3 nanobelts at relatively lower temperature
(190 °C). This method is easy and generally used to produce several
nanomaterials at low cost on a large scale.25−27

Humidity
sensors constructed with metal sulfide nanostructures
have been extensively reported.18,28−32 However, most of them have long response/recovery time and large
humidity hysteresis. In this paper, synthesis of Bi2S3 nanobelts through liquid–solid phase reaction method,
structural characterization, evaluation of texture coefficient, optical
properties, BET surface area analysis, humidity sensing properties,
and effect of humid environment on the transport properties were examined.
Furthermore, synthesis through liquid–solid phase reaction
method, evaluation of texture coefficient, humidity sensing properties,
and effect of humid environment on the transport properties were explored
for the first time for Bi2S3 nanobelts. Results
show that optimized Bi2S3 nanobelts RH sensors
possess high response in humid environment, fast response/recovery
time, good recyclability, and good stability compared to other metal
sulfide nanostructures reported in the literature.18,28−32 The schematic diagram of a homemade RH sensing setup is shown in Figure 1.

the development of Bi2S3 nanobelts RH sensor.

2 Results and Discussion
Figure 2a shows
the X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of Bi2S3 nanobelts, acquired using Cu Kα X-rays with wavelength of
1.5418 Å. The pattern matches with PDF card number 00-006-0333
(space group Pbnm and space group # 62), and no impurity
peak is present. The Bi2S3 nanobelts are of
orthorhombic phase with lattice constant parameters a, b, and c equal to 11.14, 11.32,
and 3.97 Å, respectively. The density (ρ) and volume of
the unit cell (V) are 6.81 g/cm3 and 501.52
Å3, respectively. These values of a, b, c, ρ, and V are in close agreement with those given in the PDF card number 00-006-0333
(a = 11.15 Å, b = 11.30 Å, c = 3.98 Å, ρ = 6.78 g/cm3, and V = 501.59 Å3). To understand the degree
of preferred orientation for different crystalline planes, texture
coefficient TC(hkl) was determined using25−27 1  where I(hkl) is the intensity extracted from XRD pattern of
Bi2S3 nanobelts, Ir(hkl) is the intensity written in the
reference PDF card,
and n is an integer corresponding to the number of
diffraction peaks under consideration. TC(hkl) ≤ 1 for randomly distributed
planes, and it is >1 for preferentially oriented planes.25−27 The calculated values of TC(hkl) for Bi2S3 nanobelts planes are
listed in Table 1.
For the (101) plane, TC(hkl) = 1.839 >1. Therefore, for Bi2S3 nanobelts, it is the preferentially oriented plane. Figure 2b shows the scanning electron
microscopy (SEM) image of Bi2S3 nanobelts with
average thickness ∼25 nm. The energy-dispersive spectroscopy
(EDS) image shown in Figure 2c contains Bi and S peaks confirming the composition and purity
of Bi2S3 nanobelts. Figure 2d shows the low-resolution transmission electron
microscopy (TEM) image of Bi2S3 nanobelts. The
nanobelts have average thickness ∼25 nm and length ∼80
to ∼300 nm. The inset of Figure 2c shows the high-resolution TEM image with a d-spacing of 0.504 nm along the (120) plane.

The UV–visible absorption spectrum with characteristics
wavelength (λmax = 342 nm) of the Bi2S3 nanobelts is shown in Figure 3a. Using this spectrum, an (αhν)2 versus hν plot was constructed
and is shown in Figure 3b. The x-intercept of the graph provides the direct
band gap of Bi2S3 nanobelts. The Bi2S3 nanobelts have a higher direct band gap value (2.95
eV) compared to the bulk Bi2S333 and in good agreement with those reported in the literature.34,35 This increment in band gap is another evidence for the formation
of Bi2S3 nanobelts that are useful as humidity
sensors due to their larger surface area.

Figure 3 Bi2S3 nanobelts: (a) absorption spectrum;
(b) (αhν)2 vs hν; (c) N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms;
and (d) pore size distribution.

The textural property of Bi2S3 nanobelts
is further considered by the nitrogen (N2) adsorption–desorption
estimation. Figure 3c,d shows the N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms
and pore size distribution plots corresponding to the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda
(BJH) method, respectively. Mesoporous materials characteristic isotherms
(type IV) were recognized in Bi2S3 nanobelts.
In light of the BJH technique and adsorption of N2 isotherm,
the estimation of pore size dispersal shows that a comparatively narrow
pore size dispersal centers at 39.7 nm. For RH sensing, porous structures
provide more passages for water vapors to travel into the sample,
enhancing its adsorption capacity. Also high BET specific surface
area with large active centers and adsorption pathways would be necessary
for a good RH sensor.36−38 The BET specific surface area of Bi2S3 nanobelts is 9.8 m2/g. This may be one of the
reasons for Bi2S3 nanobelts displaying good
RH sensing properties.

To evaluate the performance of Bi2S3 nanobelts
RH sensor, the I–V curves
were measured from 11 to 97% RH and are shown in Figure 4a. For each RH level, the I–V curves are linear, indicating
Ohmic contact between the Bi2S3 nanobelts and
Ag electrodes. At 5 V, the current is 10 μA at 11% RH, 19 μA
at 32% RH, 28 μA at 58% RH, 50 μA at 76% RH, and 133 μA
at 97% RH. Clearly, the current in the Bi2S3 increases with increase in RH. The resistance of the sensor calculated
at 11% RH is 4.94 × 105 Ω and that calculated
at 97% RH is 3.38 × 104 Ω at 5 V. Therefore,
the resistance of the sensor at 97% RH is 14 times less than that
at 11% RH. The increase in current with increase in RH indicates decrease
in resistance of the Bi2S3 nanobelts sensor
with increase in RH and is shown in Figure 4b. Among other characteristics of the RH
sensors, response (R) of the sensor is very important,
which in our case is defined as39 2  where RH1 is the
resistance of
sensor at 11% RH, which is the lowest RH level and RH2 is
the resistance of the sensor at certain higher RH levels (32, 58,
76, and 97%). All of the values of resistances are calculated at 100
mV. Response and recovery times are very important characteristics
of a sensor. Response time is the time in which the sensor’s
response approaches 90% of the maximum response value after the RH
sensor is exposed to a certain RH level (32, 58, 76, and 97%). Recovery
time is the time in which the sensor’s response approaches
10% of its original value after the RH sensor is exposed to the lowest
RH level (11%). For Bi2S3 nanobelts RH sensor,
response and recovery time curves at different RHs are shown in Figure 4c. From this figure,
we note that the response of RH sensor increases linearly with increase
in RH. Its percentage values are ∼0.15, 34, 49, 65, and 81
at 11, 32, 58, 76, and 97%, respectively. A linear relationship between
response and RH is shown in Figure 4d. The response and recovery times for Bi2S3 nanobelts were calculated from Figure 4c and are plotted in Figure 4e at 32, 58, 76, and 97% RH with respect
to 11% RH. The response times at 32, 58, 76, and 97% RH with respect
to 11% RH were 8, 9, 10, and 10 s, respectively. Similarly, the recovery
times at 32, 58, 76, and 97% RH with respect to 11% RH were 15, 15,
15, and 15 s, respectively. So, the response time increases with increase
in RH up to 76% RH and remains constant above 76% RH. But constant
recovery time (15 s) was observed for all RH levels. These results
for Bi2S3 nanobelts sensor are compared to other
metal sulfide nanostructure RH sensors, as given in Table 2. From Table 2, it can be seen that response/recovery time
for Bi2S3 nanobelts RH sensor is faster than
previously reported metal sulfide nanostructure RH sensors. The reproducibility
for RH sensor is another important parameter to investigate its performance. Figure 4f shows that the
Bi2S3 nanobelts RH sensor has reproducibility
over three consecutive cycles with <5% deviation when RH is varied
from 11 to 90 to 11%.

RH sensors have been extensively investigated by complex impedance
(Z* = Z′ + Z″) analysis, where Z′ is the real
part and Z″ is the imaginary part of Z*. For Bi2S3 RH sensor, Z′ vs Z″ plots are shown in Figure 5a. These measurements
are performed at 0.1 V alternating current (AC) signal with 20 Hz
to 2 MHz frequency at ambient conditions. Along Z′ from right to left, the frequency increases. From Figure 5a, a complete semicircle
and a little straight line after the semicircle in the low-frequency
region are seen at all RH levels. But this straight line is more visible
at higher RH than at lower RH, which means that at higher level of
RH, ionic conductivity is more dominant than the electronic conductivity.40 Overall conductivity of the Bi2S3 nanobelts increases with increase in RH. Semicircles at different
RH levels give the bulk resistance of the Bi2S3 nanobelts. Bulk resistance decreases with increase in RH. The AC
measurements compliment the direct current (DC) measurements that
as RH increases, the resistance of Bi2S3 nanobelts
decreases. So, at 100 Hz, impedance decreases from 4.9 × 105 Ω (11% RH) to 1.9 × 104 Ω (97%
RH), at 10 kHz, impedance decreases from 3.1 × 105 Ω (11% RH) to 1.4 × 104 Ω (97% RH),
and at 2 MHz, impedance decreases from 1.7 × 104 Ω
(11% RH) to 4.7 × 103 Ω (97% RH). The impedance
change for Bi2S3 sensor is strongly dependent
on RH at lower frequencies compared to the impedance change at higher
frequencies.

(c) stability during 30 days measurement at 100 Hz and 0.1 V; and
(d) capacitance vs log f.

Figure 5b
shows
the humidity hysteresis loop for Bi2S3 RH sensor.
This humidity hysteresis is the maximum difference in the adsorption–desorption
curve and is the most important parameter for RH sensors. The observed
maximum hysteresis in Bi2S3 RH sensor is ∼5%,
which shows its good reliability.

Long-term stability of the
Bi2S3 nanobelts
RH sensor was checked over 30 days in air at 25 °C. For this
purpose, impedance of the sensor was measured at different RH levels
after every 5 days at constant AC voltage (0.1 V) and frequency (100
Hz). Figure 5c shows
the impedance of sensor with time. The impedance of the sensor shows
<5% deviation with time, indicating the good stability of Bi2S3 nanobelts sensor over time.

The effect
of RH on capacitance, AC conductivity, and modulus (M*) of Bi2S3 nanobelts RH sensors
is also studied. The AC measurements were carried out at 0.1 V AC
voltage and at different RH levels (11–97%) from 20 Hz to 2
MHz. Figure 5d shows
the capacitance vs log f plot for the Bi2S3 nanobelts RH sensor. It is obvious from the
graph that at higher frequencies (≥103 Hz), the
capacitance was almost constant and at lower frequencies (≤103 Hz), capacitance increases as frequency decreases. At lower
frequencies (≤103 Hz), capacitance increases with
increase in RH. The hydrophilic nature of Bi2S3 nanobelts facilitates humidification of water molecules on its surface.41 According to dielectric theory of physics, capacitance
is almost independent of frequency for an ideal capacitor. At low
RH environment, only a small quantity of water vapors adsorb on the
surface of nanobelts, which can be considered as ideal. At higher
RH, the amount of water adsorbed increases and the leak conductance
appears. The effective expression for the capacitance is C = ε* × C0, where C0 is ideal capacitor’s capacitance and
ε* = (εr – iγ/ωε0) is the complex dielectric constant. The εr, γ, ω, and ε0 are known as relative
dielectric constant for ideal capacitor, leak conductance, angular
frequency, and vacuum capacitance constant, respectively. With increase
in RH, γ increases.42 From the above
equations, it is obvious that C is directly proportional
to γ and inversely proportional to ω, which means that C increases with increase in RH, and this increase is higher
at low frequencies. C is hardly affected in the higher-frequency
region. This is because in the lower-frequency region, carriers have
enough time to respond, while in the higher-frequency region, carriers
do not have enough time to respond due to quick change in the electric
field.43 This explains the observed dependence
of capacitance of Bi2S3 nanobelts on frequency.

AC conductivity (σac) of Bi2S3 nanobelts is given by 3  where A is the cross-sectional
area and d is the thickness of the sensor. The σac of the Bi2S3 nanobelts at different
RH levels is shown in Figure 6a, which shows that σac increases with increase
in RH. For each RH level, σac is independent of frequency
at lower frequencies and increases with increase in frequency at higher
frequencies. Therefore, change in σac with RH is
in accordance with eq 3. At 100 Hz, σac = 3.15 × 10–5 S/m for 11% RH and σac = 69.15 × 10–5 S/m for 97% RH, which is 23 times greater than that at 11% RH. At
10 kHz, σac = 6.01 × 10–5 S/m
for 11% RH and σac = 84.14 × 10–5 S/m for 97% RH which is 14 times greater than that at 11% RH. At
2 MHz, σac = 4.03 × 10–4 S/m
for 11% RH and σac = 24.18 × 10–4 S/m for 97% RH, which is 6 times greater than that at 11% RH. So,
the effect of RH on σac is high in the lower-frequency
region compared to that in the higher-frequency region.

Figure 6 Bi2S3 nanobelts: (a) AC conductivity vs log f; (b) M′ vs log f; (c) M″ vs log f; and (d) M′ vs M″.

Relaxation process due to the
existence of substantial conductivity
cannot be described with the support of C or ε
illustrations. So, the illustration of modulus is useful to describe
the relaxation processes for C or ε with nonzero
conductivity.44,45 The modulus M* = iωC0Z*. The notations used in this equation are already explained
in this paper. Figure 6b shows variation of the real part of modulus (M′) with frequency. At all RH levels and frequencies ≤103 Hz, M′ approaches 0. At frequencies
≥103 Hz, there is continuous dispersion with increasing
frequency, which may be due to the conduction of short-range charge
carriers. This may be due to the deficiency of restoring force for
the movement of electric charge under the impact of steady electric
field. So, the electrode effect is eliminated in the material.46 With an increase in RH, M′
curves shift toward higher frequencies, indicating the increase in
DC conductivity.47Figure 6c shows the imaginary part of modulus (M″) vs log f. It can be seen
that there is one dominant relaxation due to interface effect. This
is because the hydrophilic nature of Bi2S3 nanobelts
facilitates the adsorption of water molecules on the surface of nanobelts,
which show the relaxation. Peak position of M″
can be used to calculate the relaxation time (τ = 1/2πfmax) by using the peak frequency (fmax). Therefore, relaxation time decreases with increase
in RH.48Figure 6d shows the complex modulus plane plot at
different RH levels as M′ vs M″. Again, one dominant relaxation due to interface affect
can be seen. All incomplete semicircles give another evidence for
ion relaxation process. It is important that at the frequency edge,
the curves show a common origin similar to the origin of graphs. This
common origin at the beginning of the incomplete semicircles at different
RH levels is a strong suggestion that at those frequencies, no other
relaxation process exists. Figure 6d also shows that the diameter of the semicircle increases
with increase in RH, which is due to the movement of ions from adsorbed
water layer to sensor’s electrodes, which leads to the development
of space charge region at sensor’s electrodes. As relaxation
time for ion migration is longer than for the charge-transfer process
in this frequency region, resistivity decreases with increase in RH.

Finally, we can propose humidity sensing mechanism for Bi2S3 nanobelts RH sensor from the material (ceramic, semiconducting,
or nanomaterial) point of view.49 For modulation
of conductivity with RH, nanometric size and semiconducting properties
play a key role. The Bi2S3 nanobelts conductivity
increases with increase in RH. This behavior can be comprehended with
the Grotthuss mechanism, which explains the tunneling of proton between
adjacent water molecules.49 Water molecules
at the triggered sites on the surface of Bi2S3 nanobelts are chemically adsorbed at lower humidity. In general,
the interaction of water molecules on the surface of sulfide may result
in the development of the SH– groups. However, this impact
has not been perceived experimentally as a typical pattern.50 Therefore, two hydroxyls per water molecule
are formed by dissociative mechanism at this stage. After that, physical
adsorption occurs with increase in humidity further. Physisorption
belongs to a multilayer phenomenon. The initial immovable layer of
physically adsorbed water is because of double hydrogen bonding of
a solo molecule. The humidity molecules form single bond in succeeding
physisorbed layers, and consequently protons may be accessible for
conduction. Physisorbed layers increase with increase in further RH,
resulting in proton hoping through water layers. Now, protons through
water layers can easily move and this conduction process is similar
to that in pure water. A schematic diagram of the sensing mechanism
is shown in Figure 7.

Figure 7 Schematic diagram of the relative humidity sensing mechanism.

We have carried out our experiment
under normal ambient conditions,
and ionic conduction at this temperature is prevailing due to humidity
content in the pores of the specified sensing material. However, it
is published that humidity content reduces with increase in temperature,
so the electronic conduction is prevailing instead of ionic conduction
during the conduction process.51

3 Conclusions
Bi2S3 nanobelts were
prepared via liquid–solid
phase reaction technique with different thicknesses, widths, and lengths.
Different characterization techniques were applied to explore their
structure, morphology, chemical composition, band gap, surface area,
pore size, etc. Bi2S3 nanobelts showed excellent
features for humidity sensing, including large response, low hysteresis
(<5%), good repeatability, fast response time (10 s), fast recovery
time (15 s), and very good stability compared to other metal sulfide
nanostructure sensors. During the direct current (DC) measurements,
the resistance of the sensor at 97% RH was 14 times less than that
at 11% RH. The response of the sensor increases linearly with increase
in RH with percentage values ∼0.15, 34, 49, 65, and 81 at 11,
32, 58, 76, and 97%, respectively. Fast response time (8–10
s) and recovery time (15 s) were observed. Reproducible and large
response was also observed between 11 and 97% RH. A 24 times decrease
in impedance was observed when RH increase from 11 to 97%. These good
features are attributed to smaller thickness and porous nature of
nanobelts. We believe that such an extremely sensitive RH sensor will
support the improvement of upcoming generations of RH sensors. Both
the capacitance and AC conductivity are greatly affected by RH in
the lower-frequency region and hardly affected in the higher-frequency
region. Linearity in I–V curves
proves the Ohmic contact, and electrical modulus study eliminates
the electrode effect in our sensor and also proves one relaxation
process. The exceptional characteristics of RH sensing for Bi2S3 nanobelts proved them to be a potential candidate
for high-performance RH sensors.

4 Experimental
Section
In this experiment, liquid–solid phase reaction
method was
used to prepare Bi2S3 nanobelts. Precursors
used in the preparation of Bi2S3 nanobelts were
bismuth acetate and thiourea. As thiourea decomposes at a low rate,
it was taken as a source of sulfur. These precursors were of analytical
grade and were used without further purification. Stoichiometric quantities
of bismuth acetate and thiourea were taken and ground in an agate
mortar separately. Fine powders of both the precursors were mixed
in a corundum crucible and then heated at 190 °C for 3 h in air.
The heating and cooling rates during heat treatment were 10 °C
per min. Blackish Bi2S3 powder was the final
product. This powder was again finely ground. This fine powder was
used for structural characteristics and device fabrication for RH
sensor.

The resulting powder was characterized using XRD “Bruker
D8 Advance Powder” with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5418
Å). The morphology analysis of Bi2S3 and
EDS analysis for chemical composition were performed using “JEOL
JSM-6340F”. Low- and high-resolution TEM images were obtained
using “TEM JEOL 2100F”. The optical properties were
studied using a “Shimadzu UV-1201 UV–visible spectrophotometer”.
BET specific surface area was evaluated by using “Micromeretics
ASAP 2020”. The density of the Bi2S3 powder
was investigated by the displacement method using gas pycnometer “G
PYC-100-A”.

For RH sensing measurements, the prepared
Bi2S3 powder was pressed into pellets in a uniaxial
hydraulic press system
using a 10 mm diameter dye and a pressure of 3 ton/mm2.
The thickness of the prepared pellet was 1 mm. The pellet was sintered
at 100 °C for 2 h to remove pores and to obtain physical strength.
The pellet was removed from the furnace box and allowed to cool naturally
before using it as an RH sensor. Electrical contacts were made with
the help of conducting silver paste on both sides of the pellet. After
forming the contacts, the pellet was cured at 100 °C for 2 h
again for better adhesion of the silver paste with Bi2S3 nanobelts.

Current–voltage (I–V) and impedance measurements of the RH
sensor of resistive type were
successively performed by putting it into several RH chambers with
different RH levels obtained with saturated salt solutions.40 Saturated solutions of lithium chloride (LiCl),
magnesium chloride (MgCl2), sodium bromide (NaBr), sodium
chloride (NaCl), and potassium sulfate (K2SO4) were utilized to obtain 11, 32, 58, 76, and 97% RH, respectively,
in sealed glass chambers at room temperature. Each saturated salt
solution was kept in a glass chamber for more than 16 h to achieve
the required RH and continuously monitor through a digital hygrometer
before DC/AC electrical measurements. An Agilent 4156C parameter analyzer
was used for I–V and dynamic
response–recovery measurements. The measuring instrument for
impedance was an Agilent E4980A LCR meter. Utilization of AC signal
maintains a strategic distance from the polarization impacts of adsorbed
water.16 In any case, for this situation,
the signal-handling circuits are confusing. Consequently, in some
cases, DC measurements are additionally used to assess the humidity
sensors.16 In a clean room environment,
the complete RH measurements setup was maintained at ambient conditions.
