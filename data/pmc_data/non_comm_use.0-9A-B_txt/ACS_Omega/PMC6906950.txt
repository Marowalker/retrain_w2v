The ability of coal to adsorb methane depends on the
coal microstructure;
however, the research on its exploration is still underway. In this
paper, a new method was adopted to investigate the evolution characteristics
of the crystallite structure of eight different rank coals and its
influence on the methane adsorption capacity. The crystallite lattice
parameters, including d002, Lc, La, Nave, and fa, were determined by
curve fitting analysis of X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectra. The methane
adsorption experiments were carried out through a static capacity
method, and the methane adsorption parameters (VL, PL) were measured. Correlations
were established for the crystallite lattice parameters and the methane
adsorption parameters. From the results obtained, there is a good
negative linear relationship between VL and d002 and a good exponential relationship
between PL and d002, indicating that the increasing d002 can weaken the methane adsorption capacity. VL displays an exponential increase with increasing Lc and Nave, whilePL presents a linear decrease, but reverse variations
are emerged in the process of change for both, and the methane adsorption
capacity is weaken temporarily. VL presents
a lognormal distribution with increasing La, and the minimum value appears at La = 1.85–1.9 nm. VL and PL both obey lognormal distribution with increasing La/Lc, but their
trends are completely opposite, and the methane adsorption capacity
is the strongest at La/Lc = 0.85–0.9. As fa increases, VL and PL present an overall exponential increase and an overall
exponential decrease, respectively, but reverse changes also emerge.
The methane adsorption is related to the crystallite structure characteristics
of coal. Finally, the influence mechanism of the crystallite structure
evolution on the methane adsorption capacity was analyzed, which has
great significance for prevention of gas disasters in underground
coal mines.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Coal is one of the main
energy resources in the world,1 and it
is essentially a polymer organic compound
that is evolved by biochemistry and physical chemistry during long
geological history. Due to the coalification and the original characteristics
of coal-forming plants, different rank coals have different microstructure
characteristics. Gas exists in coal in the form of adsorbed and free
states, and gas in an adsorbed state accounts for about 80–90%.2 Gas disasters, such as coal and gas outburst,
occur in the process of massive mining of coal seams, and the possibility
of gas disasters increases with the increasing mining depth and stoping
rate.3−5 It is helpful for engineers to master the mechanism
of gas disasters by investigating the interaction between different
rank coals and gas and then taking effective prevention and control
measures. Because of heterogeneity and complex physical and chemical
structures, the microstructure characteristics of coal have a significant
influence on the interaction between coal and gas.6−8 Therefore, it
is especially important to investigate coal macromolecular structure
and its effect on the methane adsorption.

Many analytical techniques
have been widely applied for the quantitative
evaluation of coal macromolecular structures because of the advancement
in technical innovation and software improvement in recent years,
such as X-ray diffraction (XRD),9−12 high-resolution transmission electron microscopy
(HRTEM),13,14 Raman spectroscopy,15,16 solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR),17,18 etc. Based on considerable research on coal macromolecular structure,
scholars have found that coal macromolecular structure is the crystallite
structure that evolves from amorphous to crystal, which is similar
to graphite crystal, and the view is universally recognized.19−21 Compared with other instrumental techniques for exploring internal
structure of coal, XRD exhibits prominent advantages. It not only
obtains the maximum structural information about carbonaceous materials
from a wide range of scattering angles but also the average value
of sample properties instead of local features,10 which is very important for coal, a material with heterogeneity.
Therefore, XRD has been widely applied in the research of the crystallite
structure. Warren applied XRD to quantitatively evaluate the structure
of carbonaceous materials at first and proposed a structural model
that is suitable for a nonideal layer material, such as carbon black,
i.e., random lattice, and the conclusion provided a theoretical basis
for a follow-up study on coal crystallite structures.22 Houska et al. and Iwashita et al. used the crystallite
lattice parameters (interlayer spacing of the aromatic layer (d002), crystallite height (Lc), and crystallite diameter (La)) to evaluate the stacking structure of carbon materials, and subsequently,
these parameters were widely applied to analyze the coal crystallite
structure.23,24

According to the variation
of the crystallite lattice parameters
of coal (d002, La, and Lc), Li et al. used XRD
and thermogravimetry coupled with mass spectrometry (TG/MS) to investigate
the evolution characteristics and mechanism of agglomerate structures
in the process of coal pyrolysis.25 Takagi
et al. estimated the stacking structure (Ps), the average number of the effective aromatic layer (Nave), and the influence of heat-treatment conditions on
the carbon stacking structure in several kinds of coals by means of
XRD and concluded that the heating rate required for the development
of the stacking structure of lower-rank coals was slower than that
required for higher-rank coals.26 Boral
et al. analyzed the relationship between the crystallite lattice parameters
(d002, La,
etc.) and the chemicals as well as petrographic parameters of coals.27 Su et al. found that the essence of coalification
is the evolution of coal crystallite structure by XRD.28 Zhu et al. compared the difference in graphitization
degree, the crystal structure types, and the crystal size for three
needle cokes by XRD.29 Zhang et al. showed
the crystallite lattice parameters of four different rank coals, its
relationship with oxidation and combustion characteristics of coal
(crossing point temperature) was discussed, it was concluded that
a positive correlation was observed between the coal rank and the
combustion characteristics, and negative correlation was observed
between the interlayer spacing and combustion characteristics.30

Methane adsorption on coal results from
the interaction between
CH4 molecules and coal microstructure.31−33 Therefore,
coal microstructure plays a decisive role in methane adsorption. Based
on the view, coal chemists have done some research. You et al. constructed
a coal molecule and simulated the electrostatic interaction between
the heteroatom group on the surface of the coal molecule and methane
molecules by molecular dynamics (MD).34 Zhu et al. studied the optimal adsorption sites of methane molecules
on shale using density functional theory.35 Based on molecular mechanics (MM) and MD, Song et al. observed that
methane molecules were adsorbed preferentially at the edge of crystallite
structure and tended to aggregate around the branched chain of the
crystallite structure.36 Meng et al. analyzed
the effects of its oxygen-containing functional group on methane adsorption
by constructing the Zhaozhuang coal molecule model, and it was discovered
that carbonyl has a greatest effect on methane adsorption.37 In addition, the influence of microscopic pore
structure on the methane adsorption sites and the methane adsorption
capacity was confirmed by Mosher et al., Li et al., and Liu et al.38−40

As mentioned, much research has focused on the interaction
between
methane molecules and coal microstructure by molecular simulation.
However, the influence of crystallite structure on methane adsorption
is less researched through the experimental method. The combination
of the high-pressure methane adsorption experiments and the XRD analytical
method was adopted to study the relationship between the crystallite
lattice parameters and the methane adsorption capacity for eight different
rank coals, and the influence of coal crystallite structure on the
methane adsorption capacity was analyzed in this paper, which will
provide theoretical foundation from another view for understanding
the methane adsorption mechanism and the prevention of gas disasters
in underground coal mines.

2 Experimental Procedure
2.1 Sample Preparation
Eight fresh coal
samples ranging from lignite to anthracite were collected from multiple
coalfields in China. The samples were collected according to Chinese
standard GB/T 482-2008 and placed in sampling bags, and then, the
bags were tightened and vacuum-sealed to prevent the contamination
and oxidation of the samples. After collection, the samples were immediately
delivered to the laboratory for sample preparation. All of the samples
were pulverized, screened to pass through size 60 mesh to 80 mesh
sieves, and dried continuously for 12 h at 80 °C. A proximate
analysis of samples was performed following the international standards
ISO 11722:2013 and ISO 1171:2010, an ultimate analysis of samples
was conducted according to international standards ISO 17247:2013
and ISO 19579:2006, and the vitrinite reflectance of samples (R0) was determined in accordance with international
standard ISO 74045:2009. The results of conventional analysis are
presented in Table 1.

2.2 High-Pressure Methane Adsorption
The adsorption process of methane is usually described by adsorption
isotherms,41−43 following the international standard ISO 18871:2015
for the measure of the methane adsorption capacity of coal samples.
Methane adsorption isotherms were tested by the static capacity method
in a 3H-2000PH1 apparatus (Beishide Instrument Technology (Beijing)
Co., Ltd.). Prior to the methane adsorption experiment, the pulverized
coal samples required for the experiment (each coal sample weighed
approximately 6 g) passed through the size 60–80 mesh were
dried in a vacuum drying oven at 80 °C for 12 h, and then placed
in the apparatus. Methane adsorption experiments were conducted at
an equilibrium pressure range of 0–5.5 MPa at 25 °C.

2.3 X-ray Diffraction
To reduce the influence
of inorganic minerals on XRD analysis, pulverized coal with a particle
size of <75 μm (200 mesh) was demineralized using a typical
three-step HCL–HF–HCL procedure.44,45 The influence of demineralization on crystallite lattice parameters
measured by XRD was negligible.26 Coal
samples (10 g), ethanol (2 mL), and an HCL solution (50 mL, 5 mol/L)
were mixed in a beaker, and then, the beaker was placed in a constant-temperature
water bath and heated for 1 h. The mixture was removed for filtration
to obtain coal sample. Next, the coal sample was mixed fully with
an HF solution (50 mL) and the above heating process was repeated.
After heating, the mixture was removed and filtered, thus obtaining
an HF-treated coal sample. Finally, the coal sample was mixed with
a concentrated HCL solution (50 mL, 1.19 g/mL). Repeating the above
heating and filtration process, the coal sample was washed with excess
distilled water until the pH of the filtrate was neutral.

X-ray
diffraction (XRD) experiments were conducted on selected samples by
an XRD diffractometer with a CBO crossover optical system (SmartLab,
Rigaku Corporation, Japan). Pulverized coal was fixed on the support
in the sample chamber, Cu Kα (40 kV, 40 mA) radiation was used
as an X-ray source, and the X-ray intensities scattered from the examined
coal samples were measured in the range of 5° < 2θ <
80° with a step size of 0.02°. The results were analyzed
using Origin Pro 9.1.0 software (OriginLab Corporation). The average
carbon crystallite lattice parameters (interlayer spacing of aromatic
layers (d002), crystallite height (Lc), crystallite diameter (La), and average number of effective aromatic layer per
carbon crystallite (Nave)) were calculated
using the Bragg’s equations and empirical equations derived
from Scherrer (eqs 1–4).27,29,46 The characterizations of these parameters in coal crystallite structure
are shown in Figure 1 1   2   3   4  where λ is the X-ray wavelength (0.15406
nm); θ002 and θ100 are the peak
positions of the (002) and (100) bands, respectively (°); β002 and β100 are the full width at half-maximum
(FWHM) of the (002) and (100) peaks, respectively (°); and kc and kα are
constants depending on the X-ray refection plane (0.89 for the (002)
band and 1.84 for the (100) band).

crystallite lattice parameters
in coal crystallite structure.

If it is assumed that the areas under the (002)
band and the γ
band (A002 and Aγ) are equal to the number of aromatic carbons and aliphatic
carbon atoms, respectively, the aromaticity of the coal can be calculated
using eq 5(47−49) 5  where A002 and Aγ are the areas under the (002) and γ
bands, respectively.

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Methane Adsorption Capacity
Figure 2 presents the methane
adsorption isotherms of coal samples fitted by the Langmuir model
at 25 °C, and all of the curves in Figure 2 correspond to type-I isotherm based on the
IUPAC classification. The experimental data clearly demonstrate that
the methane adsorption capacity is greatly affected by the coal rank.
The good fits (R2 > 0.99) in Figure 2 illustrate that
the use of the Langmuir model for describing methane adsorption on
coal surfaces is reasonable and convincing; therefore, the Langmuir
volume (VL) and Langmuir pressure (PL) can be used to evaluate the methane adsorption
capacity.50−52VL is a direct indicator
of the CBM gas storage capacity and is proportional to the total number
of available sites for adsorption. PL is
closely related to the affinity of a gas on a solid surface and the
energy stored in coal formation.52

Figure 2 Adsorption
isotherms of methane on coal samples.

Table 2 and Figure 3 present the Langmuir
fitting parameters (VL and PL), and the fitting degree is high. In Figure 2, the methane adsorption amount
increases gradually and flattens with the increasing adsorption equilibrium
pressure and there is a positive correlation between the methane adsorption
isotherm and the coal rank (except for PX (R0 = 1.46%)). The results demonstrate that there is a remarkable
discrepancy in the methane adsorption capacity for different coal
samples, varying widely from 10.05 to 31.17 mL/g for VL and from 0.45 to 2.70 MPa for PL. The sample YQ presents the greatest VL and the smallest PL, and the
sample MTG appears to show the smallest VL and the greatest PL. Therefore, the
affinity of methane molecules is the strongest toward the surface
of sample YQ and the weakest for sample MTG. VL shows an up–down–up trend with the increase
of R0, and there is a reverse trend in
the change of PL. The two inflection points
in the trends occur at R0 = 0.5% and 1.46%,
respectively. This phenomenon may be related to the coalification
of different stages.11

3.2 XRD Spectral Characteristics and Parameter
Evolution
3.2.1 XRD Spectral Characteristics of Coal Samples
Figure 4 shows the
original XRD spectral curves of selected coal samples, and it can
be seen that these demineralized coal samples have the same graphite
characteristics as reported in previous articles.53,54 The (002) and (100) diffraction peaks are all found in the XRD spectra
of selected coal samples, and the peak value appears at around 2θ
= 25 and 44°, respectively. As the coal rank increases, the (002)
diffraction peak sharpens and the (100) diffraction peak becomes more
obvious. The (002) diffraction peak is reflected comprehensively by
the carbon crystal peak ((002) band), which is arranged regularly,
and the carbon peak of the amorphous structure (γ band);10,29,55 therefore, the (002) diffraction
peak has a certain asymmetry. It can be seen that the peak position
of the γ band appears at 2θ = 21° by curve-fitting
the (002) diffraction peak, and the curve fitting of (002) diffraction
peaks for four representative coal samples (MTG, PX, DSC, and ZZ)
is shown in Figure 5. The (002) band reflects the stacking height of the aromatic layer,
and it corresponds to the crystallite formed by polycondensation of
the aromatic nucleus, namely, aromatic crystallite. In theory, the
2θ value of the (002) band gradually increases with the increase
of coal rank until it reaches 26.6°. The γ band is related
to nonaromatic structures, such as aliphatic structures; in other
words, it is caused by aliphatic side chains, functional groups, and
aliphatic hydrocarbons attached to aromatic nucleus. The (100) diffraction
peak reflects the condensation degrees of the aromatic rings, namely,
the size of the aromatic layer.

Figure 5 Curve fitting of XRD spectra of representative coal samples
for
the (002) peak: (a) MTG, (b) PX, (c) DSC, and (d) ZZ.

The diffraction angle (2θ), the full width
at half-maximum(β),
and the peak area (A) of the (002) band and γ
band were obtained by curve-fitting of the (002) diffraction peak,
and similarly, the diffraction angle (2θ) and full width at
half-maximum(β) of the (100) peak were obtained by curve-fitting
the (100) diffraction peak. The crystallite lattice parameters (d002, Lc, La, Nave, aromaticity
(fa), and La/Lc) were calculated according to eqs 1–5, and La/Lc reflected the morphological characteristics of aromatic structures.
The statistics for the crystallite lattice parameters of eight coal
samples are shown in Table 3.

3.2.2 Crystallite Lattice Parameter Evolution
of Coal Samples
Figure 6 depicts the relationship between crystallite lattice
parameters (d002, Lc, La, Nave, La/Lc,
and fa) and R0. As seen in Table 3 and Figure 6, the
crystallite lattice parameters show obvious stage evolution characteristics
with the change of coalification. The d002 ranges from 0.3456 to 0.3507 nm, which indicates that the selected
coal samples have a lower-level ordered crystallite unit relative
to graphite (0.336–0.337 nm).56d002 shows three different trends with the increase
of R0; d002 decreases rapidly at R0 = 0.4–0.6%, d002 increases slightly and slowly at R0 = 0.6–1.25%, and d002 decreases again, and the speed is slower than that
of R0 = 0.4–0.6% at R0 = 1.25–3.4% (Figure 6a). These trends are related to the jump
point in the coalification process reported by Bustin and Guo.57Lc ranges from 1.5881
to 2.4506 nm, La ranges from 1.7969 to
2.2462 nm, and the variations indicate that the crystallite size of
coal increases with the enhancement of coalification. Lc increases rapidly and then gradually flattens; the demarcation
point is approximately R0 = 1.5% (Figure 6b). However, there
is a notable discrepancy between the fitting curve and experimental
data at R0 = 1.46%, and Song’s
report indicated that the increasing speed of Lc will slow down at R0 = 1.2–1.5%.58 Therefore, there is a certain correlation between
the trends of d002 and Lc if the error is ignored. La increases slowly with the increase of R0, and the demarcation point is approximately R0 = 0.6% (Figure 6c). Nave is related to Lc and d002, varying from 5.53
to 8.09, and its trend is similar to that of Lc (Figure 6d). La/Lc exhibits a
U-shape curve correlation with R0. La/Lc decreases slowly
at R0 = 0.4–2.25%; it presents
transitory stagnation and varies little at R0 = 2.25–2.75% and increases slowly at R0 = 2.75–3.4% (Figure 6e). fa ranges
from 0.6853 to 0.8386, and it increases linearly with the increase
of R0 (Figure 6f).

Figure 6 Variation of crystallite lattice parameters
with the coal rank:
(a) d002, (b) Lc, (c) La, (d) Nave, (e) La/Lc, and (f) fa.

According to the evolution characteristics of the
crystallite lattice
parameters for selected coal samples, the condensation degree of aromatic
rings increases gradually and the arrangement of aromatic layers becomes
gradually regular. Although the variation process does not conform
to a linear relationship, it presents phased evolution characteristics.
Coal crystallite structures have a complex evolution mechanism.

When R0 = 0.4–0.6%, nonaromatic
structures in the coal, such as aliphatic side chains (−CH3, −CH2, etc.) and oxygen-containing functional
groups, begin to exfoliate; the branching degree of aliphatic structure
begins to decrease, and the aliphatic hydrogen content is reduced.59 It is worth noting that the abscission of oxygen-containing
functional groups is most prominent at R0 = 0.43–0.5%.60 After the abscission
of nonaromatic structures, nonhydrocarbons such as soluble organic
matter are formed, the proportion of aromatic carbon atoms in coal
is increased, and the new active sites in the structural units of
coal are gradually formed.61,62 The abscission of nonaromatic
structures results in d002 decreases rapidly, it also increases
the possibility and speed at which the crystallite structure is reconstructed
in the longitudinal direction,63 and thus Lc and Nave increase
rapidly. However, compared with the abscission of nonaromatic structures,
the condensation of aromatic rings in the transverse direction occurs
later,64 so the trend of La shows temporary gentleness. The changing speed of the
aromatic structural unit in the longitudinal direction is higher than
that in the transverse direction, so the crystallite structure changes
from a “flat type” to a “lanky type” (flat
type and lanky type represent the morphological characteristics of
the crystallite structural unit), and La/Lc decreases. At this stage, a large
number of nonaromatic structures remain in the coal structure and
molecular structures are arranged irregularly and relatively loosely.65

When R0 =
0.6–1.25%, aliphatic
structures begin to dramatically exfoliate and methylene is detached
faster than other aliphatic compounds.66,67 Meanwhile,
oxygen-containing functional groups continue to be exfoliated, the
partial bridge bond in the structural unit begins to rupture,28 and the number of new active sites increases.
Therefore, aromatic rings are condensed gradually at active sites
in the transverse direction and La increases
gradually. In addition, dehydrogenation is initiated in the aromatic
system and partial residual functional groups connected to the stable
aromatic layers form at all angles, such as hydroxyl and some hydrogenated
aromatic rings. There is a certain steric hindrance between the aromatic
layers,11 which causes d002 to increase slightly, and the increasing speeds of Lc and Nave are slower.
The gap between the increasing speed of La and Lc decreases, the decreasing speed
of La/Lc slows
down gradually, and crystallite structural units present as a lanky
type. This stage is mainly based on the evolution of nonaromatic structures;
the numbers of aliphatic structures and oxygen-containing functional
groups dramatically decrease, the aromatic structural system becomes
slightly larger, the regularity of the molecular arrangement is enhanced
slightly, and the coal structure is denser.

When R0 = 1.25–3.4%, the content
of nonaromatic structures in coal is reduced, they decrease slowly
with the enhancement of coalification, and this stage is mainly based
on the evolution of aromatic structures.64 The condensation between aromatic rings is enhanced gradually, the
increasing speed of La is faster than
that at R0 = 0.6–1.25%, and dehydrogenation
in the aromatic system and the adjustment of steric hindrance occur
synchronously; this step is completed very quickly.68 Therefore, d002 decreases again
and Lc and Nave increase quickly at first and then increase slowly. The increasing
speed of La is gradually greater than
that of Lc, which causes La/Lc to present a U-shape
curve at this stage. The increasing speed of the crystallite structural
unit in the longitudinal direction is gradually smaller than that
in the transverse direction. At this stage, the regularity of the
molecular arrangement is enhanced, the aromatic rings are condensated
more intensely, the aromatic layers are arranged more closely, and
a strong shrinkage stress is produced, which results in the production
of micropores.64

3.3 Impact of the Crystallite Structure on Methane
Adsorption
In Figures 3 and 6, although the methane adsorption
capacity and crystallite lattice parameters do not evolve synchronously
with the increase in R0, both have similar
evolution trends, indicating that the crystallite structural evolution
of coal has a certain influence on the methane adsorption capacity,
but it is not the only influencing factor.69,70 The variations of VL and PL with crystallite lattice parameters are shown in Figure 7, and it can be seen
that crystallite lattice parameters have a good fitting degree with VL and PL. There
is a good linear relationship between VL and d002, and an obvious exponential
relationship exists between PL and d002 (Figure 7a). The methane adsorption capacity decreases with
the increasing interlayer spacing of the aromatic layer. VL presents an overall exponential increase with the increase
of Lc and Nave, and PL presents an overall linear decrease
with the increase of Lc and Nave, but it is worth noting that significant reversal
changes existed for VL and PL at Lc = 1.9331–2.0281
nm and Nave = 6.53–6.80 (Figure 7b,d). Therefore,
the methane adsorption capacity decreases temporarily during the evolution
process of the aromatic structure in the longitudinal direction. VL shows a lognormal distribution with increasing La, and the minimum value appears at La = 1.85–1.9 nm. Although PL presents an overall exponential decrease as La increases, significant reverse variation occurs
at La = 1.8221–1.9171 nm (Figure 7c). The methane adsorption
capacity first decreased to the minimum and then increased slightly
with the crystallite diameter increasing. Although the trends of VL and PL with La/Lc are opposite,
both present lognormal distributions. VL reaches the maximum and PL reaches the
minimum when La/Lc = 0.85–0.9, and there is no longer obvious variation
for VL and PL when La/Lc > 1.0 (Figure 7e).
Therefore, the methane adsorption capacity is enhanced to the greatest
degree when the ratio of the crystallite diameter to the crystallite
height increases gradually to 0.85–0.9; then, the methane adsorption
capacity begins to decrease until the ratio is 1, at which point it
is no longer obvious. The overall trends of VL and PL with fa display exponential increases and exponential decreases,
respectively, but reverse variations are also produced at fa = 0.7236–0.7588 (Figure 7f).

Figure 7 Variation of VL and PL with crystallite lattice parameters: (a) d002, (b) Lc, (c) La, (d) Nave,(e) La/Lc, and (f) fa.

Although the influence of the partial crystallite
structural characteristics
in coal on the methane adsorption capacity can be reflected clearly
by the variations in VL and PL with a single crystallite lattice parameter, different
crystallite lattice parameters have different evolutionary laws with
the increasing coal rank and thus every crystallite lattice parameter
needs to be combined to analyze the influence of crystallite structural
evolution on the methane adsorption capacity. Figure 2 shows that the adsorption capacity is the
weakest for the sample MTG (R0 = 0.42%)
and the adsorption capacity is the strongest for the sample YQ (R0 = 3.32%). Compared with the other samples,
the sample MTG has the largest d002 (0.3507
nm) and the smallest La (1.7969 nm), Lc (1.5881 nm), Nave (5.53), and fa (0.6853); additionally,
its crystallite morphological characteristics are shown as a flat
type. The crystallite structure of MTG is just beginning to be formed,
the interlayer spacing of the aromatic layer is large, the longitudinal
stacking degree and the transverse extended degree are very small,
the average number of effective aromatic layers is low, and the crystallite
structure is very irregular. Research has shown that the number of
effective aromatic layers has a great influence on the micropore structure
and the micropore structure is easily formed between the effective
aromatic layers or at the edges of aromatic structures.71 However, because the crystallite structure is
in a rudimentary stage for sample MTG, the formation of a new micropore
structure is restricted, the aromatic structure is formed as a flat
type, and the average number of effective aromatic layers is less.
In addition, aromatic carbon has a stronger adsorption capacity than
aliphatic carbon and methane molecules are always adsorbed preferentially
on aromatic carbon and then an aliphatic carbon.72,73 The presence of oxygen-containing functional groups is not conducive
to the adsorption of methane molecules.74 Although there are large amounts of primary pores in the coalification
stage in which the sample MTG can be located in theory,75 aliphatic structures and partial oxygen-containing
functional groups play a controlling role in the formation of these
primary pores,64 i.e., primary pores are
dominated by aliphatic structures and oxygen-containing functional
groups. Therefore, for the sample MTG, VL is the smallest, PL is the largest,
the saturated adsorption amount of methane is the smallest, and methane
is mainly present in these primary pores in a free state.76 The sample YQ belongs to high-rank coal; the
non-aromatic structures have been largely ruptured, d002 (0.3456 nm) is the smallest, La (2.1005 nm) and fa (0.8357) are
relatively large, Lc (2.4506 nm) and Nave (8.09) are the largest, and the crystallite
morphological characteristics are shown as a lanky type (La/Lc = 0.8571). The crystallite
structure of sample YQ is arranged closely and regularly; there is
a large volume of crystallite structure, the average number of effective
aromatic layers is more, and strong shrinkage stress is produced.
Therefore, a large number of micropore structures dominated by aromatic
carbon are produced and the aromatic carbon content increases. Meanwhile,
due to the disappearance of nonaromatic structures, primary pores
are decreased. Methane is adsorbed heavily around micropores and aromatic
carbons.

Based on the evolutionary characteristics of crystallite
lattice
parameters, when R0 = 0.4–0.6%,
nonaromatic structures begin to exfoliate and primary pore structures
begin to decrease. New active sites begin to form, the proportion
of aromatic carbon begins to increase, the interlayer spacing of the
aromatic layer is decreased rapidly, the average number of effective
aromatic layers is increased rapidly, and the crystallite structure
changes from a flat type to a lanky type; therefore, micropore structures
dominated by aromatic carbon are gradually formed. At this stage,
the dominant adsorption sites of methane are increased, saturated
adsorption amounts of methane are increased, and the amount of free
methane is decreased. When R0 = 0.6–1.25%,
the structural evolution is based mainly on the abscission of nonaromatic
structures and the primary pores in coal are dramatically decreased.
Meanwhile, the interlayer spacing of aromatic layers is increased
sharply because of the existence of steric hindrance, the crystallite
size and the average number of effective aromatic layers increase
slowly, and aromatic structures are rather unstable; therefore, although
the number of micropores increases, the increase is not obvious. In
summary, the adsorption sites of methane in nonaromatic structures
decrease dramatically, but the dominant adsorption sites of methane
increase less, and thus, the amount of methane saturated adsorption
is decreased and the amount of free methane is increased. When R0 = 1.25–3.4%, the structural evolution
is based mainly on aromatic structures. The number of micropores dominated
by aromatic carbons is increased dramatically as a result of the gradual
increase of shrinkage stress, the content of nonaromatic structures
decreases slowly, and primary pores vary slightly. For these reasons,
methane is adsorbed robustly around the dominant adsorption sites,
the methane saturated adsorption amount is increased, and the amount
of free methane is decreased.

4 Conclusions
In this paper, correlations
were established for crystallite lattice
parameters and methane adsorption parameters using a method that combines
X-ray diffraction (XRD) and high-pressure methane adsorption experiments.
The influence of crystallite structural evolution on the methane adsorption
capacity was analyzed and discussed, and the following conclusions
are obtained:

(1) VL, PL, and crystallite lattice parameters all present staged
variations
with the increasing coal rank. Although the demarcation points of VL and PL are not
exactly the same as those of crystallite lattice parameters, there
is a certain correlation apparent in these trends.

(2) With
the increase of d002, VL and PL present
linear decreases and exponential increases, respectively. VL presents an overall exponential increase with
the increase in Lc and Nave, and PL presents an overall
linear decrease with the increase of Lc and Nave, but there are obvious and
temporary reverse changes for VL and PL in their variation processes. As La increases, VL presents a
lognormal distribution and PL presents
an overall exponential decrease, but there is also obvious reverse
variation for PL at a specific stage. VL and PL all obey
lognormal distribution with the variation of La/Lc. As fa increases, VL and PL present an overall exponential growth and an overall
exponential decline, respectively, but the reverse change still exists
for VL and PL in a specific evolutionary stage of fa.

(3) The variations of crystallite lattice parameters reflect
the
evolution of the coal crystallite structure. In different stages of
coalification, the aromatic structured and nonaromatic structures
have different evolution speeds, which results in the number of total
adsorption sites and dominant adsorption sites being different at
every coalification stage; therefore, there are significant differences
in the methane adsorption capacity.
