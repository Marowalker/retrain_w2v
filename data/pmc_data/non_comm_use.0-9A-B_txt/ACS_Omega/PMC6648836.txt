Novel polymeric nanoparticles (NPs)
with uniform sizes were prepared
from peptide–vinyl polymer diblock hybrids by the self-organized
precipitation method. Hybrid polymers of polystyrene (PSt) and tetrapeptide
(cell-binding epitope RGDS, reverse SDGR, cationic KKKK, and anionic
DDDD) were successfully synthesized by combining solid-phase peptide
synthesis and reversible addition fragmentation chain transfer polymerization
methods. Narrowly dispersed hybrid polymers (polydispersity index
< 1.25, Mn 14 000–17 000)
were obtained. Altering the preparation conditions easily tuned the
size and size distribution of the NPs. When the ζ-potentials
for the NP suspensions were measured at pH 6.0, the obtained values
corresponded to the net charge of each peptide segment. More importantly,
the NPs could encapsulate fluorescent Nile red (NR) and magnetic iron
oxide NP (MNP), which might be suitable for fluorescent imaging and
magnet-induced patterning of cells, respectively. The interactions
of NPs with cells (NIH/3T3 fibroblast) and the magnetic effects were
examined for NR/MNP-loaded PSt–RGDS and −SDGR NPs. Both
NPs were readily incorporated into cells, but only NR/MNP-loaded PSt–RGDS
NP showed magnetic responsiveness in cell adhesion and cultures.

Introduction
In biological applications
ranging from drug delivery to cellular
imaging, polymeric nanoparticles (NPs) with a biocompatible exterior
are becoming increasingly more important.1−6 These applications are based on the intrinsic properties of polymeric
NPs and depend on the constituent polymeric materials and the surface
functionalization. The surface properties are typically controlled
after particle preparation by surface modifications, including surface-initiated
polymerization and7 grafting-onto methods,
for an appropriate polymer chain through covalent or noncovalent interactions8 and layer-by-layer polymer deposition.9

Herein, we describe the spontaneous formation
of polymer NPs with
a cell-adhesive function without surface modifications from block
polymers composed of a short peptide block and a polystyrene (PSt)
block through a self-organized precipitation (SORP)10−12 route. Such
peptide–polymer hybrids have recently been investigated to
fabricate biofunctional nanostructured materials.13−22 The conjugation of synthetic polymers with peptides offers well-defined
nano-objects, including lamellae, cylindrical micelles, spherical
micelles, and vesicles in appropriate media. The nano-objects depend
on both the character and combination of each block segment.

Peptides mainly play roles in self-organization, whereas polymeric
blocks provide structural (physical) stability. Additionally, peptide
segments introduced as one block show interesting biofunctions when
the peptide sequence is suitably designed. Examples include cell binding,
cell spreading, and cell proliferation.23,24

In cell
biology, materials ranging from 50 to 200 nm uptake NPs
into a wide variety of cells.25,26 NPs with a narrow size
distribution yield a higher substrate encapsulation efficiency and
exhibit a better biocompatibility with cells and tissues than polydisperse
NPs.27−30

Herein, we prepare uniform biocompatible NPs from hybrid block
polymers with a tetrapeptide segment and a PSt block via the SORP
method. This method has recently been used to prepare narrowly distributed
polymer NPs, which can be spontaneously formed based on nonequilibrium
processes during slow evaporation of a polymer solution. Adjusting
the preparation conditions tunes both the particle size and the size
distribution. Additionally, multifunctional NPs are fabricated by
encapsulating fluorescent dye (Nile red, NR) and magnetic iron oxide
NPs (MNPs) into our polymeric NPs. The feature should be useful for
fluorescent imaging and magnet-induced patterning of cells. Magnetically
responsive NPs have also received much attention because of their
widespread potential applications.31,32

Hybrid
block polymers are prepared by combining solid-phase peptide
synthesis (SPPS) and a reversible addition fragmentation chain transfer
(RAFT) polymerization.33,34 As the hydrophobic polymer block,
PSt is synthesized via polymerization in the presence of a peptide
chain transfer agent (CTA). The RGDS (Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser) sequence is
employed as a peptide segment of the block polymer since this sequence
binds to the integrin receptors present on the cell surface.35,36 For comparison, three other sequential peptides (reverse sequence
SDGR, cationic KKKK, and anionic DDDD), whose numbers of repeating
amino acid units are adjusted to that of the RGDS peptide (four units),
are also prepared and attached to the PSt block in the same manner.
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) observations and ζ-potential
measurements characterize the prepared particles, whereas phase contrast
and confocal microscopic observations estimate the interactions with
cells and cellular uptake.

Results and Discussion
Synthesis and Characterization
of Peptide–Polymer Hybrids
The hybrid block polymers
were prepared by combining SPPS and RAFT
polymerization. The RGDS sequence was employed as a peptide segment
of the block polymer since it had a cell-binding ability. Three other
sequential peptides were prepared and used for comparison: the reverse
sequence SDGR, cationic KKKK (K4), and anionic DDDD (D4). In these sequences, the number of repeating amino acids
was adjusted to that of the RGDS peptide (four units). PSt was chosen
as a hydrophobic polymer block because it should behave as a constituent
for the particle core. Scheme 1 outlines the synthesis of hybrid block polymers.

Scheme 1 Synthesis
of Peptide–Polymer Hybrids via RAFT Polymerization
The objective peptides (RGDS,
SDGR, K4, and D4) were successfully prepared
by SPPS by Fmoc (9-fluoroenylmethoxycarbonyl)
chemistry. The N-termini of the resultant peptides were reacted with
4-cyano-4-(phenylcarbonothioylthio) pentanoic acid as a RAFT agent.
The obtained peptide-CTAs, which contained the protective groups,
were characterized by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization
time-of-flight massspectrometry (MALDI-TOF) MS and 1H NMR
spectroscopy analyses (Supporting Information). Subsequently, RAFT polymerizations of St were carried out in acetone
initiated with azobisisobutyronitrile (AIBN) in the presence of the
corresponding peptide-CTAs as a chain transfer agent at 60 °C
for the prescribed periods.

Figure 1a shows
the SEC traces for peptide side-chain-protected PSt–RGDS hybrid
polymers prepared with different polymerization times. All SECs displayed
unimodal chromatograms, and their peak tops shifted systematically
to a higher molecular weight as polymerization progressed. Figure 1b plots the number-average
molecular weight (Mn) and the polydispersity
index (PDI = Mw/Mn) based on the SEC charts as a function of conversion. The
PDI values ranged from 1.1 to 1.27, indicating that nearly monodispersed
polymers were formed. The linearity of the Mn versus conversion plot was similar to the theoretical values
calculated from the ratio of the monomer (St) and RAFT agent (RGDS-CTA)
in the feed and the monomer conversion. Hence, the polymerization
proceeded via a controlled, living mechanism. Removal of the protective
groups from the peptide block eventually yielded the objective PSt–RGDS
hybrid polymer. The three other hybrid polymers (PSt–SDGR,
PSt-K4, and PSt-D4) were prepared in a similar
manner.

molecular weight (Mn) or polydispersity
index (PDI) and the conversion (%).

Preparation of Peptide–Polymer Hybrid NPs from SORP
The SORP method was used to prepare peptide–polymer hybrid
NPs. Compared to conventional particle preparation methods, the SORP
method had three main advantages: (i) changing the preparation conditions
controlled the particle size and its distribution. (ii) Surfactants
and protective colloids were not necessary. (iii) Its preparation
procedures were simple.

Tetrahydrofuran (THF) and water were
used as a good and a poor solvent for the hybrid polymers, respectively.
The use of water should facilitate the localization of the polar peptide
segments of the hybrid polymers at the periphery of the resultant
NPs. Such hydrophilic sequence effects on the NP structure have previously
been reported by Yabu et al.37,38

The SORP method
generated uniform polymer NPs. Typically, PSt–RGDS
(Mn 17 000) was dissolved in THF
(good solvent) to form a homogeneous solution (0.1 mg mL–1). Then, water (2 mL, precipitant) was added to this polymer solution
(1 mL) while gently stirring at a constant speed of 1 mL min–1. Then, the preparation conditions, including the molecular weight
of the polymer (Mn), the concentration
of THF polymer solution, the ratio of THF solution and water, their
total volumes, and the rate of water addition, were adjusted to synthesize
NPs (ca. 100 nm as a target size with a relatively narrow size distribution).

The resulting solution was left in air at room temperature until
THF completely evaporated, yielding the NP suspension. Figure 2 shows the SEM images for the
PSt–RGDS NP as well as those for PSt–SDGR (Mn 17 000) and the peptide-segment-free PSt homopolymer
for comparison. The PSt homopolymer was prepared by conventional radical
polymerization of St initiated with AIBN in the absence of the RAFT
agent.

and (c) PSt NPs prepared through the SORP route. (d) Plots of the
size distributions as functions of the particle sizes observed in
the SEM images. Concentrations of the polymer THF solutions are 0.1
mg mL–1.

Figure 2d
plots
the particle size distribution based on the SEM observations. PSt–RGDS
and PSt–SDGR provided uniform NPs with an average size of 100
nm and a relatively narrow size distribution. Meanwhile, the peptide-free
PSt showed a broad particle size distribution ranging from 100 to
600 nm. These differences in the size and the size distribution were
attributed to the presence of the peptide segment in the polymer.

The existence of the polar peptide segment was important not only
to stabilize the interface between the particle surface and the water
phase during particle formation but also to yield a well-controlled
size and size distribution. In the case of peptide-free PSt, the coalescence
of growing particles appeared random due to the unstable interface
of the particles. Generally, as the polymer concentration of THF solution
increased, the number density of precipitated particles increased
during particle preparation. This often resulted in coalescence among
particles, which led to heterogeneity in their sizes and distributions.
Neither the PSt particle size nor its distribution could be controlled
when the polymer concentration was increased from 0.1 to 1.0 mg mL–1 as both ranged from the nanometer to the micrometer
scale (Figure S1). In contrast, when the
same experiment was performed for PSt–RGDS and −SDGR,
the average particle size definitely increased from 100 to 200 nm
while maintaining the original narrow size distribution. Hence, the
peptide segment in the polymer molecule preferred the water phase
due to its polar nature and was located predominantly at the particle
surface. The effect of molecular weight (Mn) of the polymers on the NP structure is also important to elucidate
the role of hydrophilic peptide segments. Thus, we synthesized PSt–RGDSs
having different molecular weights (Mn = 9500, 17 000, and 33 000) by varying the conversion
in the RAFT polymerization (Table S1).
The NPs were prepared by the SORP method in the same manner as described
above, and the SEM images together with their size distributions are
shown in Figure S2. It can be seen from
the SEM pictures that the PSt–RGDSs with molecular weight Mn = 17 000 and 33 000 show spherical
particles with a smooth surface and about 100 nm size, although the
size distribution of the larger polymer of Mn = 33 000 is somewhat broader than that of the polymer
with Mn = 17 000. The PSt–RGDS
having the lowest molecular weight of Mn = 9500 provides a huge particle (average size = 260 nm) with a remarkable
uneven surface, probably due to swelling of the particles in water
derived from a higher content of the polar peptide segment per particle.
Therefore, we decided to use the PSt–RGDS with a molecular
weight of Mn = 17 000 in the following
experiments. Consequently, the peptide segment played an important
role in controlling both the size and the size distribution of the
resultant particles.

To confirm that the peptide segments preferentially
existed near
the surface of the NPs, the SORP method was applied to other two peptide–polymer
hybrids [PSt-K4 (Mn 14 000)
and PSt-D4 (Mn 17 000)]
under the same conditions. Figure 3 shows the SEM images. PSt-D4, whose peptide
segment had an anionic net charge at pH 6.0, provided uniform NPs
with the almost same size (ca. 100 nm) as those for PSt–RGDS
and PSt–SDGR NPs. At pH 6.0, the cationic PSt-K4 did not show a globular shape with a nonuniform distribution. This
was attributed to the difference in hydropathy39 between the cationic lysine residue and the anionic aspartic
acid residue, which might cause a slight change in the interface stability
during particle formation; that is, the anionic aspartic acid residue
(hydropathy index −3.5) was slightly more hydrophobic than
the cationic lysine residue (hydropathy index −3.9). Another
factor attributed to the interface unstabilization might be a cation−π
interaction40 being present only in the
case of PSt-K4, that is, intramolecular interaction between
the cationic Lys residue of the K4 segment and phenyl group
of the PSt block. The ammonium group of the lysine residues should
be deprotonated when the aqueous phase has a pH of 11. Increasing
the pH to 11 provided 100 nm size PSt-K4 particles with
a narrow distribution similar to the anionic PSt-D4 (Figure 3d). Note that the
C-termini of all peptide segments were carboxylate anions in such
a pH region.

PSt-K4 NP prepared at pH 11. (d) Plots of the size distributions
as functions of the observed particle sizes in SEM images ((a) and
(c)). Concentrations of the polymer THF solutions are 0.1 mg mL–1.

If the peptide moiety
in the block polymers helped stabilize the
NPs dispersions, it would accumulate predominantly near the NP surfaces
during particle preparation. The ζ-potentials of the NPs containing
different types of peptide segments were measured. Table S2 summarizes their values and the corresponding net
charge of the peptide segments at pH 6.0. Both PSt-D4 and
PSt–RGDS NPs with a negative charge showed negative values
(−43.6 and −51.1 mV, respectively), whereas the positive
PSt-K4 provided a positive value of the ζ-potential
(+33.1 mV). These results strongly suggested that the peptide segments
were oriented toward the water phase during particle preparation,
resulting in the location of peptide segments near the NP surface.
It was supposed that the peptide moiety of the block polymers existing
in the hydrophobic inner part of the NPs might be stabilized to weaken
its polarity with hydrogen bonding.

Multifunctional NPs from
PSt–RGDS through SORP
Multifunctional NPs were prepared
by encapsulating a fluorescent
dye (NR) and/or magnetic iron oxide NP (MNP) into the PSt–RGDS
NPs. These features would be useful for bioimaging and magnet-induced
cell patterning, respectively. During the precipitation process, NR
and/or MNP were simultaneously encapsulated into PSt–RGDS NPs
due to the hydrophobicity of the substrates. First, fluorescent NR
was encapsulated. Figure S3 shows the SEM
image and the size distribution estimated from the image. The SORP
approach generated uniform NPs with a particle size (about 100 nm)
and distribution similar to those for the NR-free PSt–RGDS
NP, which is shown in Figure S3 for comparison.

Figure 4a displays
the fluorescence emission spectra recorded on NR-encapsulated PSt–RGDS
NP, free NR in water, and NR in toluene when excited at 530 nm. NR
in water had an emission maximum at 640 nm. Encapsulation in PSt–RGDS
NP simultaneously enhanced the fluorescence intensity and blue-shifted
the peak top to 566 nm, indicating that NR existed in the more hydrophobic
inner core of the PSt–RGDS NP. In fact, the emission maximum
of NR in toluene appeared at 566 nm, which was consistent with that
for NR-encapsulated PSt–RGDS NP. This spectral consistency
strongly supported encapsulation of NR into the polymer NP.

spectra for NR-loaded PSt–RGDS NP in water
([NR] < 0.1 mg mL–1), NR in water ([NR] = 0.03
mg mL–1), and NR in toluene ([NR] = 0.1 mg mL–1), excited at 530 nm. Photos for the aqueous suspensions
of MNP-loaded PSt–RGDS NP (b) without and (c) with a magnet
attached to the bottom of the test tube.

MNP encapsulation was carried out in a similar manner. The
SEM
images shown in Figure S3c,d indicate that
MNP was incorporated in the PSt–RGDS NP (size 130 ± 30
nm). The encapsulated MNPs did not greatly influence the shape and
size of the NP, compared with those of MNP-free PSt–RGDS NP. Figure 4b,c shows photographic
images of the suspensions of MNP-loaded PSt–RGDS NP without
and with a magnet, respectively. When a magnet was attached, the milky-white
suspension marked with a dashed red circle moved to the bottom of
the test tube, suggesting that a magnetically responsive PSt–RGDS
NP was realized. This feature would be useful in cell engineering
such as cell patterning and manipulation.

Interaction of PSt–RGDS
NPs with Cells and Uptake Behavior
Both NR and MNP (NR/MNP)-loaded
PSt–RGDS and SDGR NPs were
prepared in a similar manner (Figure S4 shows particle size and size distribution). Their interactions with
a cell of a mouse NIH/3T3 fibroblast were examined in serum-free medium
from the viewpoints of cellular uptake and its magnetic control. Figure 5 shows confocal microscopic
pictures where the living cells are stained with calcein-acetoxymethyl
(calcein-AM) at 24 h after adding each particle suspension to the
cell-attached substrates. Both NPs emitted a red fluorescence due
to NR encapsulated into NP from the living cell stained in green with
calcein-AM, suggesting the uptake of NPs into the cells and/or the
attachment of NPs onto the cell surfaces. Such cellular uptake and/or
attachment of NPs proceeded smoothly and was completed within 1 h.
As mentioned in the Introduction, one of the
effects specific for materials in the range of 50–200 nm was
the uptake of NPs into a wide variety of cells.25,26 Therefore, the particle size of our hybrid polymers (ca. 150 nm)
might play an important role for uptake into the cell; it might influence
the kind of peptide sequence (RGDS or SDGR), although the cell attachment
ability of the RGDS sequence would be definitely superior to that
of the reverse SDGR sequence. Thus, the effect of a permanent magnet
field on the cell culture was examined for cells containing NR/MNP-loaded
PSt–RGDS or SDGR NP.

cells treated
with NR/MNP-loaded (a) PSt–RGDS NP and (b) −SDGR NP
for 24 h after adding the NP suspension in serum-free medium. Note
that the cells are stained with calcein-AM and ethidium D prior to
fluorescence microscopic observations. Green emissions indicate live
cells. Red emissions indicate NPs and dead cells, whose sizes are
on the nanometer and micrometer scales.

Figure 6 schematically
illustrates a top-view of a PSt-coated glass-bottomed dish, where
the suspension of cells, including NR/MNP-loaded PSt–RGDS or
SDGR NP, is seeded on a magnet plate. After a 24 h culture, the living
cells were stained with calcein-AM. They were then observed using
a confocal microscope. The pictures (Figure 6b,c) were taken at the shaded part drawn
in Figure 6a. In the
case of PSt–SDGR NP, cell adhesion was observed both with and
without a magnet plate, whereas in the case of PSt–RGDS NP,
the cell adhesion proceeded predominantly with the magnet plate, although
the number of attached cells for the PSt–RGDS NP was somewhat
smaller than that for PSt–SDGR NP in the presence of the magnet
plate. This difference in the attached number of cells might be reasonably
explained by considering the difference in cell-binding ability between
the NPs; that is, the PSt–RGDS NP has a much higher binding
ability to the cell compared with the PSt–SDGR NP and thus
more PSt–RGDS NPs attached to the cell surfaces would disturb
adhesion of the drifting cells to the hydrophobic substrate. As a
result, the number of cells appearing in Figure 6b might be restricted, compared with that
in Figure 6c. The numbers
of cells attached (N, cells per cm2) with
(Nmagnet) and without (N0) the magnet plate were then evaluated, and the ratio
(Nmagnet/N0) was calculated to be 4.7. On the other hand, for PSt–RGDS
NP, cell adhesion predominantly proceeded in the presence of the magnet,
and the ratio of Nmagnet/N0 was 10, which is about twice larger value than that
for the case of PSt–SDGR NP. The observed magnetic effect was probably because the PSt–RGDS
NP with a higher binding ability to the cell inhibited adhesion of
drifting cells to the hydrophobic substrate and the magnetic field
helped such an adhesion.41 The usage of
the NR/MNP-loaded PSt–RGDS NP might realize two-dimensional
control of the cell alignment by supplying a magnetic field.

Conclusions
This study prepared novel polymeric NPs
from peptide–vinyl
polymer diblock hybrids via the SORP approach. The synthesis combined
SPPS and RAFT polymerization to fabricate well-defined hybrid polymers.
The polymers consisted of PSt as a hydrophobic vinyl polymer segment
and RGDS with cell-binding ability as the peptide segment. For comparison,
three other peptide segments were synthesized: the reverse SDGR, cationic
KKKK (K4), and anionic DDDD (D4). Adjusting
the experimental parameters easily tuned the size and size distribution
of the NPs.

The ζ-potentials measured for the NP suspensions
reflected
the net charge of the corresponding peptide sequence. The peptide
segment was located near the periphery of the NPs. Hydrophobic fluorescent
dye (NR) and magnetic NP were effectively encapsulated in the hybrid
NPs to produce multifunctional (NR/MNP-loaded) NPs.

The interactions
of these NR/MNP-loaded PSt–RGDS and −SDGR
NPs with NIH/3T3 fibroblast cells were examined. Both NPs, whose sizes
ranged between 100 and 200 nm, were smoothly incorporated into the
cells. Finally, the effect of a permanent magnetic field on the cell
culture was investigated. For NR/MNP-loaded PSt–RGDS NP, cell
adhesion proceeded predominantly in the presence of a magnet. In contrast,
cell adhesion occurred without a magnet for the SDGR counterpart.
Employing NR/MNP-loaded PSt–RGDS NP would allow a magnetic
field to manipulate the cell pattern.

were carried out on an Autoflex speed instrument (Bruker Daltonics,
Massachusetts) using DHBA as a matrix. The number-average molecular
weight (Mn) and the polydispersity index
(PDI = Mw/Mn) of the polymers were determined by size exclusion chromatography
(SEC) using a JASCO LC-net II/AD (JASCO, Tokyo, Japan) equipped with
a refractive index (RI) detector (column, GF-710F; eluent, THF; flow
rate, 1.0 mL min–1; temperature, 40 °C). Nearly
monodispersed polystyrene was purchased from GL Science (Tokyo, Japan)
and used as the calibration standard. Scanning electron microscopy

Preparation of Tetrapeptide
Chain Transfer Agent (Peptide-CTA)
Four kinds of peptide-CTAs
were prepared by SPPS using Fmoc chemistry.
These peptides were synthesized on a 2-chlorotritylchloride resin
using Fmoc-l-amino acid derivatives [Fmoc-Ser(But)-OH, Fmoc-Asp(OBut)-OH, Fmoc-Gly-OH, Fmoc-Arg(Pbf)-OH],
DIPEA, DIPC, and HOBt in DMF for coupling and piperidine (25%)/DMF
for Fmoc removal. Finally, 4-cyano-4-(phenylcarbonothioylthio) pentanoic
acid as the RAFT agent was coupled with RGDS-resin in DMF, including
DIPC and HOBt.

Treatment with DCM/HFIP (v/v 7:3) cleaved the
peptide-CTAs from the resins. After purification, the obtained peptide-CTAs
were identified by MALD TOF MS and 1H NMR spectroscopies.
The data are summarized in the Supporting Information.

RAFT Polymerization of St with Peptide-CTA
A typical
preparation procedure of PSt–RGDS was as follows. The monomer
St (0.42 g, 4.0 mmol) was dissolved in acetone followed by the addition
of RGDS-CTA (5.3 mg, 5 μmol) and the initiator (AIBN, 0. 41
mg, 2.5 μmol). The solvent was added to adjust the total solution
volume to 1.0 mL. This solution was poured into a polymerization glass
tube, which was subsequently degassed by repeating freeze–vacuum-nitrogen
filling–thaw cycles. The glass tube was then sealed into an
ampule. Polymerizations were carried out at 60 °C with various
polymerization times. After the prescribed time, the ampules were
opened and the solvent was removed. Residues were purified by washing
with cold methanol several times. The dried samples were subjected
to SEC analyses. The data are summarized in Table S1 (Supporting Information). Finally, the protective groups
were removed by treating with a DCM solution of TFA/TIS (v/v 7:1)
overnight. Complete removal of the protective groups was confirmed
by 1H NMR spectroscopy.

Preparation of NPs through
SORP and Encapsulation of NR and
MNP
Typically, 1 mg of PSt–peptide was dissolved in
10 mL of THF (0.1 mg mL–1), which is a good solvent
for the polymer. While gently stirring at room temperature at a constant
speed of 1 mL min–1, 2 mL of water, which is a precipitant
for the polymer, was added to 1 mL of the polymer solution. The polymer
solution remained optically transparent during this mixing process.
The resulting polymer solution was placed in a small vial and left
open to the air at room temperature until the THF completely evaporated,
yielding NPs suspensions.

To achieve multifunctional polymeric
NPs, MNP (0.5 wt % relative to the polymer) was dissolved simultaneously
with PSt–peptide in THF, and a similar preparation procedure
was carried out as described above. Hydrophobic NR as a fluorescent
dye was entrapped in the NPs when 0.2 wt % NR relative to the polymer
was added to the THF solution of the polymer prior to adding the precipitant.
Moreover, MNP and both of NR and MNP (NR/MNP) could be entrapped in
the NPs in a similar manner.

Interaction of NPs with Cells and Cellular
Uptake
Cell
culture was performed as follows. NIH/3T3 fibroblasts were cultured
using Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) supplemented
with 10% calf serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. Cells were incubated
at 37 °C under 5% CO2. Cells grown to 80% confluence
were passaged by trypsinization, diluted, and inoculated into a fresh
tissue culture dish. Fibroblasts were seeded at a density of ca. 2
× 104 cells per cm2 onto the PSt-coated
glass-bottomed dish. After incubating for 40 min, the dish was washed
with the PBS (−) buffer to remove unattached cells. Then, the
NR/MNP-loaded NPs suspensions (4 mL, 25 μg mL–1, serum-free DMEM) were added. After the prescribed period, the cells
were stained with calcein (calcein-AM, 6 μM) and ethidium D
(EthD-1, 4 μM) for 15 min. Fluorescence images were obtained
on a confocal microscope system. Green and red cells corresponded
to live and dead cells, respectively. The magnetic effects on NP-containing
cell adhesion were estimated by confocal microscopic observations
for calcein-AM-stained cells in the presence or the absence of a permanent
magnet (Neodymium magnet). NP-containing cells were prepared by incubating
the cell (ca. 4 × 105 cells) in the NR/NMP-loaded
NPs suspensions (4 mL, 25 μg mL–1, serum-free
DMEM) for 12 h and then by recovering via centrifugation at 1200 rpm.
Cell viability assays were conducted using a live/dead cell staining
kit II (Takara Bio, Shiga, Japan).
