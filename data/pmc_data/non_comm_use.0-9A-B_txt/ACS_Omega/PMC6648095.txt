We
present a new model for the length and radius evolution of catalyst-free
III–V nanowires grown by selective area epitaxy. We consider
simultaneous axial and radial growth of nanowires, which is more typical
for this technique compared to the vapor−liquid−solid
growth of nanowires. Analytic expressions for the time evolution of
the nanowire length and radius are derived, showing the following
properties. As long as the nanowire length is shorter than the collection
length of group III atoms on the sidewalls, the length evolves superlinearly
and the radius evolves linearly with time. For longer nanowires, both
the length and radius increase sublinearly with time. The scaling
growth laws are controlled by a single parameter that depends on group
V flux. The model fits well the data on the selective area growth
of InAs and GaAs nanowires by different techniques. Overall, these
results can be used for controlling the catalyst-free growth of III–V
nanowires and their morphology, including ternary III–V material
systems.

Introduction
Semiconductor nanowires (NWs) offer almost
unlimited possibilities for the bottom-up design of their morphology,
composition, and crystal phase, and enable monolithic integration
of a wide range of optoelectronic III–V NW heterostructures
with silicon electronic platforms.1−3 Selective area epitaxy
(SAE) of III–V NWs is a promising gold-free alternative to
the vapor–liquid–solid (VLS) growth method.3 The SAE growth of III–V NWs works equally
well in molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) or in metal organic chemical
vapor deposition (MOCVD) techniques. In this work, we try to understand
the kinetics of the axial and radial growth of III–V NWs in
the true SAE growth mode of catalyst-free NWs4 on patterned substrates with regular arrays of lithographically
defined pores.4−9 Most importantly, we study theoretically the time evolution of the
mean length and radius of SAE NWs versus the growth parameters and
epitaxy technique. According to the experimental data,5,7−9 both the length L and radius R of the SAE-grown NWs usually increase with the growth
time, while the radius of Au-catalyzed VLS III–V NWs is fixed
by the initial size of the growth seeds and stays constant in most
cases.10 Radial growth modifies very substantially
the earlier models of VLS NWs at a time-independent radius R = const (see ref (10) for a review). We will show that, after a short incubation
stage, the NW length and radius exhibit scaling power-law dependences
on the growth time. The power exponents of these dependences are related
to the growth conditions, the NW length, and the array pitch.

Model
The SAE growth and main model parameters are illustrated in Figure 1. We consider the
group III and V atomic fluxes Ik in nm–2 s–1 (k = 3 for
group III and 5 for group V atoms), arriving onto the top NW facet
and its sidewalls with efficiencies χk and χk′, respectively. These χ are defined
by the beam geometries in MBE or precursor pyrolysis efficiencies
in MOCVD. Highly diffusive group III adatoms are able to migrate from
the NW sidewalls to the top, with the corresponding diffusion current j3 giving the total number of the adatoms arriving
to the top facet per unit time (in s–1). We neglect
the desorption of group III adatoms from the top part of a NW on the
time scale of interest (assuming sufficiently low substrate temperatures).10 For highly volatile group V atoms such as arsenic
and phosphorous, we neglect the surface diffusion but account for
the desorption in the form of dimers (As2 or P2). The crystallization (or incorporation) rates of III–V pairs
on the NW top and sidewalls are described by the quadratic terms,
which are proportional to the product of the corresponding group III
and V surface concentrations. This regular growth model assumes that
the meeting of any two dissimilar adatoms on the surface immediately
produces a stable III–V pair in the solid state.11 These considerations yield the steady-state
material balance equations for the surface concentrations of group
III and V atoms on the NW top (n3, n5) and sidewalls (n3′, n5′) (in nm–2) of the form 1   2  

Figure 1 Cylindrical NW with a uniform radius R from base to top, growing in a SAE mode without any droplet
on top. Kinetic processes that govern the growth include impingement
of group III and V atoms, desorption of group V dimers, crystallization
of III–V pairs on the NW top facet and sidewalls, and the diffusion
current j3 of group III atoms from the
NW sidewalls to the top. The axial and radial NW growth rates are
determined by the crystallization rates on the top NW facet and sidewalls,
respectively.

Here, k5 and k5′ stand for the desorption rate constants
of group V atoms from the NW top and sidewalls, whereas k35 and k35′ describe the crystallization
rate constants of III–V pairs on the NW top and sidewalls,
respectively. The net diffusion current j3 should be divided by the surface area of the top facet πR2 to give the diffusion-induced contribution
into the total flux of group III atoms arriving to the top facet.
The same current should be divided by the collection area 2πRL* to describe the corresponding decrease in
the surface concentration of the group III adatoms per unit area of
the NW sidewalls. The collection length for group III adatoms can
equal either the entire NW length L or only the effective
diffusion length λ3 at the NW top.12−15 In directional deposition techniques
such as MBE, this λ3 is usually limited by the shadowing
effect,16 with λ3 ≅ P cot anα3 related to
the interwire spacing (pitch) P and the angle α3 of the group III beam with respect to the vertical.17 Therefore, we will use the simplified expression 3  in what
follows.

Finally, the axial and radial NW growth rates are given
by 4  with Ω35 as the elementary
volume of III–V pairs in solid. In the equation for the radial
growth rate, the L*/L factor accounts for the fact that crystallization of III–V
pairs occurs only at the NW areas exposed to vapor fluxes but contributes
into the radial growth of the entire NW. This is valid under the assumption
of the cylindrical NW having a uniform radius from base to top at
any moment of time, consistent with the position-independent adatom
concentrations and incorporation rates in eqs 1, 2, and 4. Tapering of NWs requires a substantial generalization of
the model and will be presented elsewhere.

To obtain the analytical
solutions to these kinetic equations, we use two additional simplifications.
First, we assume that the SAE growth proceeds under group V rich conditions;
otherwise, it would quickly transition to a self-catalyzed mode with
a group III droplet on top.4 Then, much
more group V atoms should desorb than crystallize in solid, corresponding
to negligible second terms in eqs 1 and 2 for group V atoms. This
yields the simple expressions 5  which directly relate
the group V concentrations to the input fluxes and temperature-dependent
desorption rate constants. Introducing the effective lifetimes of
the group III atoms on the NW top and sidewall facets by definitions 6  Equations 1 and 4 are reduced to 7   8  

Second, we should present the diffusion
flux j3 as a function of n3. In the absence of desorption of a group III element,
the simplest approximation reads 9  with 10  

Here, the
ε parameter is given by the ratio of the group III adatom activities
on the NW top and sidewalls, similar to that in refs (10)(13), and (18) for VLS NWs. The quantity
2πRL*χ3′I3 is the total number of group III atoms collected by the top
part of the NW of length L* per unit time,
which equals the direct diffusion current from the NW sidewalls to
the top. The ε times the same quantity equals the reverse diffusion
current from the NW top to the sidewalls. The resulting diffusion
current given by eq 9 equals zero under equilibrium conditions (at ε = 1).

We first use eq 9 in eq 7 for n3/τ5 and insert the result into eq 8 for dL/dt, which yields the straightforward result for
the axial growth rate. Using eq 9 in eq 7 for n3′/τ5′ gives n3′/τ5′ = εχ3′I3, and then eq 8 for dR/dt yields
the result for the radial growth rate. Thus, our final equations describing
the simultaneous axial and radial growth of cylindrical NW have the
form 11  with F3 = Ω35I3 as the
deposition rate of group III atoms in nm/s. This model should be relevant
for sufficiently long NWs, while for shorter ones, we should additionally
account for a diffusion flux from the substrate surface.14,18,19 While negligible for the growth
on rough substrates with a parasitic layer,13 this flux can be much more important in the case of atomically flat
patterned SiOx/Si(111) substrates and
can be essential for understanding of the growth start.4,6 This important question will be considered elsewhere. However, for
NWs whose length is much larger than the group III diffusion length
on the oxide surface, eq 11 should give a reasonable approximation for the growth kinetics
(this is guaranteed for the axial growth rate when L > λ3, and hence, the diffusion flux from the
substrate no longer contributes into the NW elongation12,18−21).

Equation 11 for dL/dt has a similar form as
the conventional expression for the axial growth rate of VLS III–V
NWs10,18−21or self-induced GaN NWs12,22 under group V rich conditions. The parameter ε directs the
diffusion flux of group III adatoms from the NW sidewalls to the top
or in the opposite direction, depending on whether the adatom activity
on the sidewall facets (χ3′I3τ5′) is larger
or smaller than that on the top facet (χ3I3τ5), as in refs (13) and (18). However, there are two
important differences. First, most growth models originally developed
for VLS III–V NWs completely ignored the influence of a group
V element, while our parameter ε contains explicitly the adsorption–desorption
and crystallization rates of group V atoms. Second, the NW radius R increases due to incorporation of the material at the
NW sidewalls, so eq 11 for L(t) and R(t) should now be
considered as the system of two connected differential equations.

Equation 10 shows that
ε decreases when k35′/k35 decreases (that is, when the crystallization rate on the NW sidewalls
is much lower than on the top) or k5′/k5 increases (that is, when the desorption rate of group V atoms
from the NW sidewalls is much higher than that from the top). This
shows the importance of a catalyst droplet in enhancing the axial
and suppressing the radial growth rate of VLS NWs, because the droplet
should collect group V atoms more efficiently and at the same time,
increase the crystallization rate of III–V pairs with respect
to the vapor–solid growth. For the SAE NW growth, any differences
in the crystallization or evaporation rates on the sidewalls and top
facets should arise due to their different crystallographic structures,
and hence, the ε parameter may be on the order of unity. We
will therefore treat this ε as the free parameter of the model,
whose value can be deduced from fitting the experimental data on the
axial and radial NW growth rates under different conditions and in
different material systems.

Results and Discussion
Equation 11 for “short”
NWs (L < λ3) is solved as follows.
At L* = L, integration
of eq 11 for R readily yields R = R0 + F3χ3′εt, where R0 corresponds to the
initial radius of the pore or pre-existing NW stem. Using dt = dR/(F3χ3′ε), eq 11 for L can be put in the form  

Integrating this with the
initial condition L(R = R0) = L0, with L0 as the length of the initial NW stem at t = 0, we obtain  

Therefore, the solutions can be presented
as 12  with 13  

The L0 can in principle be put to zero; however, we reiterate that
our model may not be suited to describe the initial stage of NW growth
evolving from the substrate surface. Also, some NWs can only be grown
on pre-existing stems of a different material (for example, InAsSb
NWs on InAs stems5), in which case L0 represents the length of the InAs stem.

For “long” NWs (L ≥ λ3), the solutions are obtained as follows. At L* = λ3, after dividing dL/dt by dR/dt, eq 11 gives  with b = χ3/(χ3′λ3ε). Integrating this with the initial condition L(R*) = λ3,
we get  

Here, R* denotes the NW radius
at the moment of time t* where L becomes equal to λ3. This expression
is further reduced to L = λ3(R / R*)a at R – R* ≪
λ3, which is the reasonable approximation unless
the growth time is very long. Substitution of this power-law dependence
to eq 11 for R yields dR / dt = A / Ra, with A = F3χ3′λ3εR*a / λ3. Upon integration with the
initial condition R(t*) = R* and presenting both length and
radius as functions of time, the resulting expressions take the form 14  with 15  

Equation 14 is
similar to the one obtained previously for the self-induced GaN NWs,12 with a short diffusion length λ3on the order of 40–50 nm.

With the known deposition
rate F3 and geometry (the χ coefficients
and the pore or stem radius R0), the obtained
expressions are controlled by the single parameter ε. It determines
the power exponents in the scaling power-law dependences of the length
and radius on the growth time as well as the characteristic times t0 and t1 for the
axial elongation and radial extension in different stages. After a
short incubation stage (involving different types of incubation processes
such as the NW nucleation on the substrate surface3,10 or
in the patterned holes,6 diffusion of group
III adatoms from the substrate surface to the NW top,4,8,12,14 or shape transformation22), the NW radius
evolves linearly with time as long as L < λ3, while the length increases superlinearly for ε <
2/3 or a > 1. The limiting case of the highest
εmax = 2/3, or the lowest amin = 1, corresponds to the linear time dependence of the NW
length. At L > λ3, both the length
and radius increase sublinearly with time. At εmax = 2/3, the power exponent for both length and radius at L > λ3 equals 1/2. The standard VLS-like
growth is recovered in the second limiting regime of the lowest εmin = 0, corresponding to a → ∞.
In this case, the NW radius stays constant, while the length increases
first exponentially and then linearly with time13,14 16  These expressions are written for L0 = 0.

Typical time dependences of the NW lengths
and radii for the fixed R0 = 50 nm, F3χ3′=2 nm/min, λ3 = 1000
nm, χ3 = χ3′, L0=0,
and different ε are shown in Figure 2. It can be seen how the fast axial growth
at a constant radius at ε = 0 is transitioned to a much slower
one as the ε parameter increases, with the length and radius
becoming comparable at ε = 0.64. The NW length increases superlinearly
with time until it reaches the diffusion length of 1000 nm, after
which the time evolution of length becomes sublinear. The further
increase of ε up to its maximum value of 2/3 may lead to situations
where the NW radius increases faster than the length so that NWs become
nanodiscs, as in ref (5) for InAsSb NWs grown on InAs stems.

Figure 2 NW length (solid lines) and radius (dash-dotted
lines) vs the growth time for different ε shown in the legend.
These curves are obtained from eqs 12 to 15 at R0 = 50 nm, F3χ3′=2 nm/min,
λ3=1000 nm, χ3 = χ3′, and L0=0. The dotted line indicates the transition
between different growth regimes occurring at L =
λ3.

The evolution of NW length and radius shown in Figure 2 qualitatively describes typical
behaviors observed experimentally for different non-VLS III–V
and III–N NWs in MBE and CBE.7−9,12,22−25 To make our analysis more quantitative,
we first consider the experimental data on SAE InAs NWs grown by MBE
in patterned arrays on SiO2/Si(111) at 480 °C, with
a fixed pore radius of 40 nm and variable pitches of the array.8Figure 3a, b show the time evolution of the NW length and diameter,
respectively, for pitches varying from 250 to 3000 nm. The diameters
given here were determined by taking the average values at the top
and bottom of each NW, as some of the NWs were slightly tapered. As
mentioned above, tapering is disregarded in our modeling. However,
the model can be used for fitting the average diameters in the first
approximation.

Figure 3 Time evolution of (a) length and (b) average diameter
of SAE InAs NWs grown by MBE in patterned arrays on SiO2/Si(111) with different pitches from 250 to 3000 nm (symbols),8 fitted by the model (lines). For the largest
pitch of 3000 nm, the length evolution is slightly superlinear, and
the diameter is linear in time in the absence of shadowing. Decreasing
the pitch leads to the decrease of the indium collection length due
to the shadowing effect, from more than 3500 nm for 3000 nm pitch
down to 500 nm for 250 nm pitch. This leads to the sublinear behavior
of both length and diameter after the NW length exceeds the collection
length of indium.

In the MBE technique,
the collection length of indium should be limited by shadowing, which
is expected to be almost negligible for 3000 nm pitch. Therefore,
we fit these data points by eq 12 at L < λ3, yielding
the linear time dependence of the NW diameter with R0=24 nm and t0 = 26 min. This
corresponds to the effective deposition rate on the NW sidewalls χ3′F3≅1.45 nm/min. As discussed in detail
in ref (8), the axial
NW growth rate is faster at the beginning of growth, which can be
attributed to the additional collection of indium from the oxide surface.
Leaving aside this initial stage, we use eq 12 for the NW length starting from L0=170 nm. The best fit to the length data for
a 3000 nm pitch shown in Figure 3a is then obtained with Rc=17.5 nm and a=1.14, corresponding to ε=0.637.
This large ε value yields only a slight superlinearity of the
length versus time. The data for smaller pitches clearly show the
sublinear behavior of the NW length and diameter, both decreasing
with decreasing pitch. All sets of data for 250 to 1000 nm pitches
are well fitted by eq 14 at L > λ3 if we assume that
the indium collection length decreases from ∼1.85 μm
for a 1000 nm pitch to ∼0.5 μm for a 250 nm pitch, which
seem plausible. Very importantly, all curves in Figure 3 correspond to the same ε=0.637, related
to a fixed V/III flux ratio,8 with the
characteristic times t1 in the range from
24 to 76 min. Overall, our model reproduces the data very well, explaining
why the length and diameter are almost linear in time for the largest
pitch and become more and more sublinear for smaller pitches after
the NW length exceeds the collection length of indium. According to
these results, the diffusion length of indium adatoms on the sidewalls
of InAs NWs at 480 °C is more than 3.5 μm, and the indium
collection on the sidewalls is limited only by the shadowing effect.
This is consistent with the earlier observations for MBE-grown InP1–xAsx NWs.13

Next, we consider the data of ref (9) for the length and diameter
evolution of GaAs NWs grown by SAE MOCVD at 750 °C on patterned
SiO2/GaAs substrates, with a 600 nm pitch and variable
pore diameter from 125 to 225 nm. These curves, shown in Figure 4, feature an interesting
nonlinear evolution of the NW lengths. Similar to Figure 2, the NW length first increases
superlinearly with time, converging to a sublinear behavior for longer
times. We speculate that this effect is due to a limited diffusion
length of gallium on the NW sidewalls. At a high growth temperature
of 750 °C, a fraction of gallium adatoms desorbs before reaching
the NW top, corresponding to the transition from the growth regime
at L < λ3 to the one at L > λ3. The pronounced superlinear increase
of the NW length for shorter times requires sufficiently large a according to eq 12. The NW diameter in this stage is linear in time regardless
of a. All theoretical curves shown in Figure 4 correspond to a fixed a = 1.83 or ε = 0.522 at L0 = 0. Other parameters are summarized in Table 1 and provide the excellent fits to the data.
From the fits, we can deduce the values of F3χ3′=5.44 nm/min and χ3/χ3′=1.78, showing that the
adsorption of gallium is better on the top NW facet than on the sidewalls.
The observed decrease of the NW length for larger pore size is explained
simply by the fact that the NW elongation is controlled by the surface
diffusion of gallium, which contributes more into the axial growth
rate of thinner NWs. Most importantly, the gallium diffusion length
on the NW sidewalls at 750 °C appears very close to 2 μm
in all cases, as shown in Figure 4.

Figure 4 Length and diameter evolution of SAE GaAs NWs grown by
MOCVD in patterned arrays on SiO2/GaAs with different pore
sizes from 125 to 225 nm (symbols), fitted by the model (solid lines
for the length and dashed lines for the diameter) with the parameters
summarized in Table 1. The time dependence of the NW length converges from superlinear
to sublinear at around 2 μm, corresponding to the diffusion
length of gallium adatoms on the NW sidewalls λ3 (shown
by the shaded zone). The NW diameters increase linearly before and
slightly sublinearly after 2 μm of length. The diffusion-like
character of growth leads to the increase of length for thinner NWs.
This is further demonstrated by the dash-dotted curve for a pore size
of 75 nm.

In summary, the proposed
approach allows one to treat simultaneously the axial elongation and
radial extension of SAE III–V NWs. The most important parameter
of the model, ε, determines the power exponents in the scaling
time dependence of the NW length and average radius and can be finely
tuned by the growth conditions including the V/III flux ratio and
temperature. We plan to generalize the model by considering more accurately
the initial stage of NW growth from the substrate surface, as well
as spatially inhomogeneous incorporation rates and tapered NW geometries.
The developed model yields simple analytical solutions with a minimum
number of parameters and therefore can be useful for understanding
and controlling the SAE growth in different material systems, including
ternary III–V NWs such as InGaAs, InAsP, InAsSb, and their
heterostructures. In particular, ref (26) gives an example of application of a similar
growth model to SAE InAsSb NWs, where the ε parameter depends
on the InSb fraction in a ternary NW. More studies of ternary III–V
NWs grown in the SAE mode will be presented elsewhere.
