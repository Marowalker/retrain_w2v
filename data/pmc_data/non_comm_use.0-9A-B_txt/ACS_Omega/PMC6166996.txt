Colloidal lithography is a cost-efficient
method to produce large-scale
nanostructured arrays on surfaces. Typically, colloidal particles
are assembled into hexagonal close-packed monolayers at liquid interfaces
and deposited onto a solid substrate. Many applications, however,
require non close-packed monolayers, which are more difficult to fabricate.
Preassembly at the oil/water interface provides non close-packed colloidal
assemblies but these are difficult to transfer to a solid substrate
without compromising the ordering due to capillary forces acting upon
drying. Alternatively, plasma etching can reduce a close-packed monolayer
into a non close-packed arrangement, however, with limited interparticle
distance and compromised particle shape. Here, we present a simple
alternative approach toward non close-packed colloidal monolayers
with tailored interparticle distance, high order, and retained spherical
particle shape. We preassemble poly(N-isopropylacrylamide)-silica
(SiO2@PNiPAm) core–shell particles at the air/water
interface, transfer the interfacial spacer to a solid substrate, and
use the polymer shell as a sacrificial layer that can be thermally
removed to leave a non close-packed silica monolayer. The shell thickness,
cross-linking density, and the phase behavior upon compression of
these complex particles at the air/water interface provide parameters
to precisely control the lattice spacing in these surface nanostructures.
We achieve hexagonal non close-packed arrays of silica spheres with
interparticle distances between 400 and 1280 nm, up to 8 times their
diameter. The retained spherical shape is advantageous for surface
nanostructuring, which we demonstrate by the fabrication of gold nanocrescent
arrays via colloidal lithography and silicon nanopillar arrays via
metal-assisted chemical etching.

1 Introduction
Colloidal
lithography is a simple, cost-efficient, and scalable
method for nanostructuring of surfaces. The process uses spherical
colloidal particles as shadow masks to fabricate arrays of complex-shaped
nanostructures by angular metal deposition and etching steps.1−6 The crucial step to prepare surface nanostructure arrays with high
precision is the deposition of a colloidal monolayer onto the solid
substrate.7,8 Frequently used methods include the self-assembly
at liquid interfaces, followed by deposition on a solid substrate,9−12 spin-coating,13 or evaporation-driven
self-assembly.14−19 The simplicity of the method and the control over feature sizes
enable applications in various research fields including photonics,20−23 plasmonics,5,24−27 phononics,28−30 electronics,31−34 anti-reflectivity,35,36 or the design of liquid-repellent
coatings.37−40

For maximal flexibility in the lithography process, it is
desirable
to control the interparticle distance between the individual colloidal
particles. The assembly of such non close-packed colloidal monolayers
requires either deposition of individual, separated particles directly
onto a surface or engineering spacing from an initially close-packed
colloidal monolayer. Non close-packed monolayers spontaneously form
at the oil/water interfaces due to a more pronounced repulsive character
of the constituent colloidal particles.41 However, their transfer to a solid substrate is substantially more
difficult, as immersion capillary forces42 tend to move particles toward each other.43 A close-packed monolayer deposited on a flexible substrate can be
mechanically separated into a desired lattice structure, but requires
an additional transfer step to the target surface and careful control
of the involved adhesion energies.44 Finally,
plasma-assisted etching of polymer particles can isotropically shrink
the polymer colloidal particles and therefore produce non close-packed
monolayers from initially close-packed arrangements.12,36,45 Although simple to implement,
this fabrication method has some limitations. (i) The diameter of
the spheres and the spacing are always coupled. By adjusting the etching
time, one can either achieve small feature sizes that are highly separated
or larger feature sizes with small separations. (ii) The separation
between the particles is limited. Typically, polystyrene colloidal
particles disintegrate when shrunk to more than half of their diameter.
(iii) The morphology of the particles is altered in the etching process.
The particles acquire a lens shape and may end up with a wrinkled
surface.

A conceptual alternative consists in the assembly of
core–shell
particles, where the shell can serve as a spacer to separate the core
particles. This concept is especially attractive for hybrid organic/inorganic
particles, where the shell can be combusted to leave a non close-packed
array of inorganic particles on the substrate. For example, using
gold core, poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNiPAm) shell
particles (Au@PNiPAm), nonc lose-packed arrays of gold nanoparticles
have been fabricated.46,47

Importantly, microgels
such as PNiPAm swell in water and are therefore
able to deform at a liquid interface and form a characteristic “fried
egg” or “core–corona” shape.48−51 Due to their compressible nature, such microgel particles show a
complex interfacial phase behavior as a function of the available
interfacial area, which can be systematically varied using a Langmuir
trough.52−56 At low densities, hexagonal non close-packed phases with a corona–corona
contact prevail. With decreasing available surface, the system undergoes
a phase transition into a hexagonal close-packed phase, where the
microgels are in a core–core contact.48,50,53,54,56,57 The surface pressure
upon which the microgels undergo phase transition depends on the cross-linking
density.54,56 Softer, less cross-linked microgels undergo
phase transition at higher surface pressures compared to more cross-linked
microgels. It was recently shown that SiO2@PNiPAm core–shell
particles undergo similar phase transition from a non close-packed
to a close-packed phase.58,59 This phase behavior,
however, was sensitive to the size of the core. The core–shell
particles with larger silica cores (d = 360 nm) were
not stable at the oil/water interface and aggregated even at low-area
fractions.60

In this article, we
take advantage of the complex phase behavior
of SiO2@PNiPAm core–shell particles and the possibility
to remove the organic shell to prepare non close-packed silica colloidal
monolayers with high-order and well-controlled interparticle distances.
We first study the phase behavior of the hybrid particles at the air/water
interface as a function of their physicochemical properties, including
the cross-linking density and the relative size ratios. Then, we identify
regions of uniform structural arrangements (i.e., outside the surface
pressure region where the system undergoes a phase transition) and
transfer the interfacial assembly to solid substrates. After shell
combustion, we obtain hexagonal non close-packed arrays of spherical
silica particles with interparticle distances up to 8 times the core
diameter and use these particle arrays to prepare high-quality
nanostructures by colloidal lithography.

2 Results
and Discussion
We synthesized SiO2@PNiPAm core–shell
particles
by seeded precipitation polymerization.58,61 We kept the
silica core diameter constant (dc = 160
nm) and varied the PNiPAm shell thickness (Figure 1a) as well as the cross-linking density,
which affects the deformability at the liquid interfaces (Figure 1b). We investigated
the effect of these physiochemical parameters on the self-assembly
at the air/water interface by the simultaneous compression and deposition
method,52−54,58 as schematically illustrated
in Figure 1c. This
method enables us to continuously transfer the interfacial arrangement
of the core–shell particles onto a tilted solid substrate with
a fixed angle (Figure 1d). Each position on the wafer can thus be correlated to the corresponding
surface pressure. We characterized the gradient on the substrate by
scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and statistical image analysis.
Finally, we combusted the shell of the core–shell particles
to achieve a non close-packed assembly of the spherical silica cores,
which serve as a mask for nanostructuring (Figure 1e–h). We can thus tune the interparticle
distance (di) by either compression of
the air/water interface or by tuning the size and cross-linking density
of the PNiPAm shell.

First, we characterized the volume phase transition62 and the corresponding particle dimensions in
bulk using temperature-dependent dynamic light scattering (DLS) (Figure 2). In the first set
of particles, we kept the cross-linking density constant at 5 mol
% and varied the shell thickness by increasing the ratio of monomer
to SiO2 cores (Figure 2a), providing particles with a total diameter from
305 to 428 nm in the collapsed state at 50 °C. In the second
set of particles, we fixed the monomer-to-SiO2 ratio and
varied the cross-linking density (Figure 2b), which influences the temperature-dependent
swelling behavior of the microgel shell. To characterize the swelling
behavior, we defined the swelling ratio β 1  where VS(T) is the volume
of the shell without the core and VS(50
°C) is the volume of the shell in
the collapsed state measured at 50 °C. As expected, the cross-linking
swelling behavior decreases with increasing cross-linking density
(Figure 2c).54,56 The shell thickness, however, has no effect on the swelling behavior,
which is in agreement with previous work.58

particles (dc = 160 nm) with varying shell
thicknesses and cross-linking densities: Temperature-dependent hydrodynamic
diameter (dH) measured by DLS for different
shell thicknesses (a) and cross-linking densities (b). (c) Swelling
ratio β of the SiO2@PNiPAm core–shell particles.
We notice a strong dependence of the cross-linking density on the
swelling behavior, whereas the shell thickness had no effect on the
swelling behavior.

Next, we investigated
the influence of the cross-linking density
on the interfacial phase behavior of the core–shell particles
at the air/water interface on a Langmuir trough. We transferred the
interfacial arrangement of the core–shell particles to a silicon
wafer by simultaneous compression and deposition. We then systematically
analyzed the substrate with a gradient length of 34 mm by taking a
scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image each millimeter. Each image
was analyzed by statistical image analysis based on the publicly available
Matlab version of the IDL code by Crocker and Grier.63Figure 3 shows the phase behavior of the core–shell particles with
2.5 mol % cross-linker (Figure 3a–c), 5 mol % cross-linker (Figure 3d–f), and 10 mol % cross-linker (Figure 3g–i). For
the core–shell particles with 2.5 and 5 mol % cross-linking
density, we observed a stable hexagonal non close-packed phase at
low surface pressures (Figure 3I). Upon increasing the surface pressure, the core–shell
particles underwent a phase transition into a hexagonal close-packed
phase (Figure 3II,III)
until all the core–shell particles were in the close-packed
phase (Figure 3IV).
The phase transition can be characterized by the interparticle distance
distribution (Figure 3c,f), where we observe the growth of the second hexagonal close-packed
phase. The phase behavior is similar to previous work on SiO2@PNiPAm core–shell particles58 and
PNiPAm microgels with an internal core–shell structure.53

of the observed phases. Scale bars for 2.5 and 5 mol %: 2 μm.
(c, f, and i) Interparticle distance distribution of the different
phases labeled by the Roman numbers showing the nucleation of a second
hexagonal phase.

However, the phase behavior
changed for the core–shell particles
with 10 mol % cross-linking density. In this sample, we did not observe
a stable hexagonal non close-packed phase, and the particles directly
aggregated into a hexagonal close-packed phase containing voids (Figure 3I). These voids gradually
disappeared upon compression until a complete hexagonal close-packed
monolayer was observed at a surface pressure above 30 mN/m (Figure 3IV). This behavior
is reflected by the analysis of the interparticle distance distribution,
where we did not detect any changes in the interparticle distance
regardless of the surface pressure during transfer (Figure 3i). The phase transition can
also be seen directly by the macroscopic optical appearance of the
interfacial layer deposited onto the silicon wafer substrates (Figure 3b,e,h). The ordered
hexagonal close-packed and non close-packed regions show prominent
structural colors resulting from grating diffraction at the ordered
colloidal lattice, whereas the phase transition region appears white
due to the disordered assembly.64

We also analyzed the phase diagram of the core–shell particles
with a fixed cross-linking density and different shell thickness.
For the core–shell particles with 5 mol % cross-linking density,
we found a stable hexagonal non close-packed phase, a phase transition
region, and a hexagonal close-packed phase, with different interparticle
distances as expected from the different shell thicknesses (Figure S1). We assume that capillary forces during
drying do not change the assembly, as we observe non close-packed
structures, which coincide with direct observation at the oil/water
interface.48,58 If capillary forces were strong
enough to alter the assembly, these non close-packed structures would
collapse into close-packed structures.

We used the statistical
image analysis to compare the compression
isotherms of the different core–shell particles and to quantify
the resulting monolayer structure (Figure 4). We calculated the area per particle by
dividing the area of each SEM by the number of microgel particles. Figure 4a,b shows the surface
pressure–area per particle isotherm for different cross-linking
densities (Figure 4a) and different shell thickness (Figure 4b). Each dot corresponds to the area per
particle analyzed from the SEM images. We observed a dependence of
the cross-linking density on the spreading of the SiO2@PNiPAm
particles with similar shell thickness at the air/water interface
(Figure 4a). With decreasing
cross-linking density, the particles are able to spread more at the
air/water interface and thus occupy larger areas, in agreement with
previous work.54,56 At high surface pressure (>30
mN/m), all particles show a similar area per particle of 250 000
nm2, which corresponds to an interparticle distance of
564 nm. This is substantially larger than the silica core with a diameter dc = 160 nm. Thus, even in the most compressed,
close-packed region, the silica cores are separated by the PNiPAm
shell. For different shell thicknesses, we observed a similar shape
in the surface pressure–area per particle isotherm, but with
a shift to a lower area per particle, and thus core separations, for
thinner shells (Figure 4b).

at the air/water interface. Surface pressure vs measured area per
particle isotherm of SiO2@PNiPAm core–shell particles
with different cross-linking densities (a) and different shell diameters
(b). Each point corresponds to an area per particle measurement determined
by the image analysis of the SEM images after deposition. The triangles
represent the hexagonal non close-packed phase, the squares the phase
transition, and the dots correspond to the hexagonal close-packed
phase. Comparison of the interfacial phases of SiO2@PNiPAm
core–shell particles with different cross-linking densities
(c) and different shell diameters (d) as a function of the surface
pressure. We notice a dependence of the stability of the hexagonal
non close-packed phase on the cross-linking density (c). Further,
the phase transition shifts to higher surface pressure values with
decreasing shell thickness (d).

The cross-linking density and the shell thickness also influenced
the phase transition (marked as squares in Figure 4a,b and filled region in Figure 4c,d). The phase transition
shifted to higher surface pressure for lower cross-linking densities,
in agreement with previous work on microgels (Figure 4c).54 For 10 mol
% cross-linking density, the core–shell particles directly
underwent phase transition and aggregated even below 1 mN/m. A similar
behavior was observed for core–shell particles with a larger
silica core.60 We hypothesize that with
increasing cross-linking density, the size of the corona decreases
and is not able to overcome the attractive capillary interactions
between the particle cores. Interestingly, the shell thickness also
influenced the start of the phase transition (Figure 4d). The phase transition shifted to higher
surface pressures for smaller shell thicknesses, which is the opposite
behavior compared to previous work by Rauh et al.,58 where a larger shell led to a better stabilization of the
core–shell particles at the air/water interface and thus a
higher surface pressure at the phase transition. We believe that this
behavior is due to differences in the sizes of the core–shell
particles. In the work by Rauh et al., the particles were significantly
smaller compared to the particles in the present study (the largest
core–shell particles had a collapsed diameter of dH(40 °C) = 250 nm, whereas our smallest core–shell
particle had a collapsed diameter of dH(40 °C) = 305 nm). The differences in the phase behavior can
be ascribed to the interfacial deformations induced by the PNiPAm
shells of different thickness and cross-linking ratio. We further
hypothesize that only the outer part of the PNiPAm shell governs the
properties of the corona and thus expands the core–shell particle
at the air/water interface.

The phase diagram then provided
us with design criteria to prepare
non close-packed colloidal monolayers. Long-range order and controlled
lattice spacing can be obtained for interfacially assembled core–shell
particles transferred to a solid substrate before or after the phase
transition, i.e., in the hexagonal non close-packed and the close-packed
phase. Figure 5a–c
shows the tilted SEM images of the SiO2@PNiPAm core–shell
particles at low (Figure 5a,b) and high surface pressures (Figure 5c). We notice that even in the hexagonal
close-packed phase, the silica cores are still separated by their
PNiPAm shell. After thermal combustion of the polymeric shell, we
yield well-ordered nonclose-packed arrangements of the silica spheres
(Figure 5d–f). Figure 5g provides an overview
of the obtainable interparticle distances from the set of samples
within this study. By variation in the shell thickness and the cross-linking
densities, the interparticle distance can be continuously adjusted
between 400 and 1280 nm.

the core–shell particles with various diameters (dH(50 °C)) and cross-linking densities ranging from
1150 to 410 nm. The labels (a)–(f) correspond to the SEM images.

Finally, we demonstrate the potential
of the prepared non close-packed
colloidal monolayers in two typical applications of colloidal lithography.
First, we prepared arrays of gold nanocrescents5,26 (Figure 6a,b). We thermally
evaporated a thin gold film (30 nm) onto the colloidal monolayer mask
with a substrate tilt angle of 30° and subsequently used reactive
ion etching at normal incidence to remove the gold film from the substrate.
Gold only remains on the surface in areas shielded by the colloidal
particles, giving rise to crescent-shaped nanostructures. In Figure 6a,b, we can see the
advantage of using core–shell particles to prepare the colloidal
shadow mask. The spacing between the particles, and thus between the
nanocrescents, can be adjusted precisely and over a wide range. Additionally,
the silica particles completely retain their spherical shape, leading
to nanocrescents with defined contour and sharp tips. In contrast,
crescent arrays fabricated with plasma-etched colloidal monolayers
as masks feature much rougher contours as the colloidal particles
are partially degraded during the etching process.65

evaporator. Scale bar: 1 cm.

As a second nanostructuring process, we prepared arrays of
vertically
aligned silicon nanowires from metal-assisted chemical etching (Figure 6c–f).22,23,66−68 We first created
a metal nanohole array by thermally evaporating gold through the non
close-packed colloidal monolayer. The gold film then serves as a catalyst
in the metal-assisted chemical etching step, in which hydrofluoric
acid and hydrogen peroxide are used to dissolve the silicon underneath
the gold film. As a result, arrays of silicon nanopillars are obtained
(Figure 6c–f).
The nanowires are uniform in size and show a smooth and perfectly
round shape due to the well-defined spherical shape and smooth surface
of the silica particles forming the nonclose-packed monolayer. The
silicon nanowire array shows vivid structural colors due to the regular
spacing between the individual nanowires over macroscopic dimensions
(Figure 6f).

3 Conclusions
In this article, we investigated the interfacial
behavior of SiO2@PNiPAm core–shell particles under
compression on a
Langmuir trough. We found that these hybrid particles undergo a phase
transition from a non close-packed arrangement with a corona–corona
contact to a close-packed arrangement with collapsed microgel shells
in direct contact. The surface pressure required for this phase transition
depended on both the cross-linking density and the thickness of the
microgel shell. Importantly, both before and after the phase transition
region, the hybrid particles formed well-ordered arrangements that
could be transferred to a solid substrate. After combustion of the
microgel shell, arrays of non close-packed silica particles can thus
be obtained with high precision. The spreading of the microgel shell
enabled a wide separation of the silica cores without compromising
the order. Using our set of microgel particles, the interparticle
distance could be tailored between 400 and 1280 nm. In contrast to
the existing methods to prepare nonclose-packed colloidal monolayers,
our method enabled a precise control of the interparticle distance
over a wide range, a choice of the core size independent of the lattice
spacing, and perfect spherical shapes and long-range order of the
particles in the non close-packed monolayer.

These characteristics
provide ideal conditions for applications
in colloidal lithography, which we demonstrate by the fabrication
of gold nanocrescents and silicon nanowire arrays.

4.1 Materials
All
the chemicals were
purchased from commercial sources and used as received unless stated
otherwise. N,N′-Methylenebis(acrylamide)
(BIS; 99%, Sigma-Aldrich), ammonium persulfate (APS, Sigma-Aldrich,
98%), ethanol (EtOH, Sigma-Aldrich, 99.9%), hexane (≥99%, Sigma-Aldrich),
tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS; 98%, Sigma-Aldrich), ammonium hydroxide
solution (28–30% NH3 basis, Sigma-Aldrich), (3(trimethoxysilyl)propyl
methacrylate) (MPS; 98%, Sigma-Aldrich), fluorescein isothiocyanate
isomer I (FITC; Sigma-Aldrich, >90%), (3-aminopropyl)triethoxysilane
(APTS; Sigma-Aldrich, >98%), hydrofluoric acid (HF, AnalaR NORMAPUR,
VWR, 40%), and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2, EMSURE,
Merck, 30%) were used as received.

N-Isopropylacrylamide
(NiPAm; 97%, Sigma-Aldrich) was purified by recrystallization from
hexane (95%, Sigma-Aldrich). Water was double deionized using a Milli-Q
system (18.2 MΩ cm, Elga PURELAB Flex).

4.2 Synthesis
of Functionalized Silica Nanoparticles
Fluorescent silica
nanoparticles with a diameter of 160 nm (±10
nm) were prepared according to the Stöber process.69 The fluorescent labeling was performed on the
basis of the previously reported protocols.60,70 First, 5.8 mg FITC (1.5 × 10–2 mmol) was
dissolved in 1.5 mL EtOH (10 mM). Then, 26.19 μL APTS (1.5 ×
10–1 mmol, 10 equiv) was added to the solution.
After the mixture was stirred for 2.5 h in the dark, 900 μL
of the reaction mixture was diluted with 4.50 mL of EtOH (5 vol equiv).

In a round-bottom flask, 250 mL EtOH, 12.5 mL Milli-Q water, and
25 mL NH3(aq) were stirred together. TEOS, 18.75 mL, was
stirred in 75 mL EtOH and both solutions were heated to 50 °C
and equilibrated for 30 min. The TEOS solution was then quickly added
to the first mixture under heavy stirring. As soon as the reaction
mixture became turbid, the prepared fluorescent dye solution was slowly
added within 8 min. We let the reaction proceed for 2 d at 50 °C.

This suspension was used for functionalization without any further
purification. We functionalized the fluorescent silica nanoparticles
with MPS and calculated its amount to obtain one molecule of MPS per
40 Å2 surface area. The surface area of the silica
particles was approximately calculated by determining the mass fraction
of the silica dispersion and using a density of 2.0 g/cm3, not taking the porosity of Stöber particles into account.71 MPS, 102.7 μL (3.9 × 10–4 mmol), was rapidly added to the silica dispersion. We allowed the
reaction mixture to stir at room temperature for at least 1 d and
then boiled it for 1 h to ensure successful functionalization. Afterward,
we purified the particles by centrifugation and redispersed them three
times in ethanol and three times in Milli-Q water. A yellow silica
dispersion of 6.59 wt % was obtained.

4.3 Synthesis
of SiO2@PNiPAm Core–Shell
Particles
A PNiPAm-microgel shell was polymerized on the
synthesized silica nanoparticles via surfactant-free precipitation
polymerization. In a round-bottom flask, 282.9 mg of NiPAm (2.5 mmol;
50 mmol/L) and the respective amount of BIS (Table S1) were dissolved in Milli-Q water. Then, we slowly added
the prepared silica dispersion under stirring. The mixture was heated
to 80 °C and purged with nitrogen. After an equilibration time
of 30 min, the nitrogen gas inlet was replaced by a nitrogen-filled
balloon to sustain the nitrogen atmosphere. The reaction was started
by rapidly adding 114 mg of APS dissolved in 1 mL Milli-Q water. We
let the reaction proceed for an hour before quickly adding 114 mg
of APS dissolved in 1 mL Milli-Q water again. Subsequently, a nitrogen-purged
solution of NiPAm and BIS (Table S2) was
added using a syringe pump (3 mL/h; 6 mmol/L) for further shell growth.
Two hours after the last addition of the reagents, the reaction mixture
was allowed to cool to room temperature. The core–shell particles
were purified by centrifugation with Milli-Q water to dispose of free
microgel particles and pure silica nanoparticles.

4.4 Langmuir Trough Simultaneous Compression and
Deposition
We used the simultaneous compression and deposition
method as described in previous work.52−54,58 We used a Teflon Langmuir trough (KSVNIMA) (area = 243 cm2, width = 7.5 cm) with Delrin barriers and the surface pressure was
measured by a Wilhelmy plate. The N-type silicon wafers (Infineon,
resistivity: 0.1–10 Ω cm) were cut to 4 × 1 cm2 and cleaned by ultrasonication in ethanol and Milli-Q water,
followed by oxygen plasma (Diener). The substrate was mounted in a
45° angle and the trough was filled with Milli-Q water. The core–shell
particle suspension was diluted to 0.5 wt % and mixed with 30 wt %
ethanol as the spreading agent. The core–shell particles were
spread on the air/water interface of the Langmuir trough using a regular
100 μL pipette. After 10 min of equilibration, the barriers
were compressed at a speed of 4 mm/min and the substrate was lifted
at a speed of 0.8 mm/min. The core–shell particle assembly
was further characterized by SEM.

4.5 Statistical
Image Analysis
We characterized
the phase diagram of the core–shell particles by statistical
image analysis based on the publicly available Matlab version of the
IDL code by Crocker and Grier.63 We first
removed the PNiPAm shell by oxygen plasma and systematically took
an SEM image at each millimeter of the silicon wafer with the deposited
assembly using a voltage of 5 kV. We choose a resolution of 2028 ×
1536 pixel2 and a magnification of 2000. Because we deposit
with a fixed angle, we were able to correlate each position of the
substrate with its corresponding surface pressure. The area per particle
was calculated by dividing the area of the image by the number of
particles. The nearest neighbor distribution was fitted by two Gauss
fits.

4.6 Gold Evaporation/Nanocrescents
The
plasmonic nanostructures were produced by following an established
colloidal lithography method.26,65 Oxygen plasma (Diener
electric Femto) was used to remove polymer residuals from the core–shell
particles and guarantee proper wetting conditions of the substrate.
Titanium (1 nm, HMW Hauner, 99.995%, <3 mm granulate) was evaporated
under a 30° angle with respect to the surface normal as an adhesion
layer, subsequently followed by 20 nm gold (HMW Hauner, 99.99%, <3
mm granulate) using a custom-built thermal evaporator (Torr International
Inc, THE3-KW). Directed argon etching (Oxford instruments, PlasmaPro
NGP 80) along the surface normal was utilized to gain crescent-shaped
particles and remove all redundant metallic material not covered by
the colloidal shadow. The silica spheres were removed using an adhesive
tape.

4.7 Metal-Assisted Chemical Etching
We
used metal-assisted chemical etching (MACE) to prepare Si nanowires
in a HF/H2O2 mixture. Here, we used the silica
cores as a mask and evaporated 3 nm titanium as an adhesion layer
followed by 20 nm gold, which acts a catalyst for the reduction of
H2O2 and induces fast anisotropic etching of
the Si in the regions covered by the Au metal film. As a result, the
metal film sinks in the Si substrate, whereas the areas not covered
by the metal are not etched.66,72

MACE was performed
within a Teflon beaker using a laboratory-made polylactic acid sample
holder perforated with small holes. The etching solution was prepared
fresh and composed of 10 mL HF, 10 mL Milli-Q water, and 2 mL H2O2. The sample was placed on the Teflon holder
and immersed in the etching solution for 10 min. Afterward, the sample
was rinsed with deionized water three times, rinsed with ethanol once,
and dried in air.22
