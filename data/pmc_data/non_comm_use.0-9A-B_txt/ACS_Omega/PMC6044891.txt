The luciferase isolated from the
firefly Photinus
pyralis (Ppy) catalyzes a two-step reaction that results
in the oxidation of d-luciferin accompanied by emission of
yellow–green light with a peak at 560 nm. Among many applications,
Ppy luciferase has been used extensively as a reporter gene in living
cells and organisms. However, some biological applications are limited
by the low stability of the luciferase and limited intracellular luciferin
concentration. To address these challenges, efforts to protein engineer
Ppy luciferase have resulted in a number of mutants with improved
properties such as thermostability, pH tolerance, and catalytic turn
over. In this work, we combined amino acid mutations that were shown
to enhance the enzyme’s thermostability (Mutant E) with those
reported to enhance catalytic activity (LGR). The resulting mutant
(YY5) contained eight amino acid changes from the wild-type luciferase
and exhibited both improved thermostability and brighter luminescence
at low luciferin concentrations. Therefore, YY5 may be useful for
reporter gene applications.

==== Body
Introduction
Bioluminescence is
widely observed among organisms from different
branches of life, including bacteria, fungi, and various metazoans.
The luciferase from the North American firefly Photinus
pyralis (Ppy) is one of the most extensively studied
enzymes involved in bioluminescence. The Ppy luciferase catalyzes
a two-step reaction that uses d-luciferin, adenosine triphosphate
(ATP), and oxygen as substrates to yield oxyluciferin in an electronically
excited state. Yellow–green light (560 nm) is emitted when
the excited oxyluciferin relaxes to the ground state.1−5 Because of the low luminescence background of cells and tissues,
luciferases have been used as reporter genes to sensitively monitor
gene expression in living cells and animals.6−8

While
the Ppy luciferase has proved to be highly useful for numerous
applications, improvements are still needed. There are several desirable
characteristics of the luciferase for biological applications in living
cells and animals. For example, emission of longer-wavelength light
improves tissue penetration in animals. Lower Km’s for the substrate ATP and d-luciferin would
also likely enhance brightness of the light produced by intracellular
luciferase. Similarly, increased thermostability of the firefly luciferase
can enhance bioluminescence in vivo by increasing the effective half-life
of the enzyme.9 Protein engineering efforts
have resulted in a number of luciferase variants with altered or improved
properties such as shifted luminescence spectra, thermostability,
pH tolerance, and catalytic activity.5,10,11 For example, a recent study reported a chimeric luciferase
that emits red light with a lower Km value
for ATP.12 Alternatively, instead of engineering
the enzyme, synthetic luciferin substrates have been developed that
improve cell permeability of the substrate to improve emission and
alter the luminescence spectra of the emitted light.13−15 Recombinant luciferases have also been used for applications in
vitro, for example, as biosensors16 and
as the light source in bioluminescence resonance energy transfer reactions.17,18 Such applications will also benefit from engineered luciferases
with improved sensitivity and thermostability.

Further engineering
of luciferases that exhibit combinations of
the desirable characteristics mentioned above can lead to improved
mutants for biological applications. Fujii et al. and Noda et al.
discovered and characterized a triple mutant LGR (I423L, D436G, L530R)
via random mutagenesis and screening that displays 20-fold lower Km values for ATP and d-luciferin compared
to the wild-type (WT).19,20 The kcat values of the LGR mutant were also reported to be 4-fold higher
than those of the WT.19 However, this LGR
mutant was expected to show low stability comparable to that of the
WT. Baggett et al. reported a combination of five amino acid substitutions
(Mutant E: T214A, A215L, I232A, F295L, and E345K) that conferred significant
thermostability, which led to improved bioluminescence in mammalian
cells.9 The five point mutations in Mutant
E have been successfully combined with those that shift the emission
peak to green and red wavelengths to confer thermostability to the
color mutants.21 Here, we combined the
mutations reported in LGR and Mutant E with the expectation of obtaining
a mutant (YY5) with improved catalytic activity at low d-luciferin
concentration and thermostability.

Results and Discussion
Protein
Expression and Purification
The genes encoding
the WT and mutant luciferases were cloned in a plasmid and recombinantly
expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3)
in terrific broth (50 mL). The enzymes were tagged with 6× histidine
at the C-terminus, which was used for purification by immobilized
metal ion affinity chromatography. All purified luciferases were analyzed
by SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and were found
to be highly homogenous (Figure S1).

Luminescence Spectra
Luminescence spectra of the luciferase
variants were measured in the presence of the enzyme (1.6 μg/mL), d-luciferin (50 μM), and ATP (2 mM) at pH 7.8 (Figure 1). The WT and Mutant
E showed essentially identical spectra with a peak at approximately
560 nm, as previously reported.21 The LGR
and YY5 mutants both display a noticeable shoulder at the 600–650
nm region. Although the spectrum of the LGR mutant has not been reported,
the double mutant (D436G, L530R) characterized by Fujii et al., shows
a similar spectrum.20

luminescence spectra were measured at 25 °C. (A) WT, (B) LGR,
(C) Mutant E, (D) YY5.

Thermostability Measurement
To measure the thermostability
of each luciferase variant, the enzymes were incubated at different
temperatures (25, 30, 35, 40, and 45 °C) and sampled over time.
Activity of the luciferase samples were then measured at 25 °C
using a microplate reader in the presence of d-luciferin
(40 μM) and ATP (2 mM) (Figure 2). The WT was stable for the duration of the experiment
(360 min) at 25 and 30 °C. However, the WT luciferase lost approximately
70% activity after 120 min at 35 °C and was completely inactivated
within 30 min at 40 and 45 °C (Figure 2A). Qualitatively, a similar trend was observed
with the LGR mutant (Figure 2B). As expected, Mutant E displayed high thermostability (Figure 2C), retaining ∼60%
activity after 120 min at 45 °C. Interestingly, activity of Mutant
E abruptly increased when incubated at 35 and 40 °C by >60%
within
the first measurement time (30 or 60 min). This observation was reproducible,
and we speculate that the purified enzyme may be partially misfolded,
which refolds into the active structure at the elevated temperature.
Nevertheless, the decay of activity following the initial jump parallels
that at 45 °C, further confirming the enhanced thermostability
at physiological temperature. The YY5 mutant showed essentially the
same characteristics, but the rates of the decay at 35–45 °C
appear to be slower than those of Mutant E.

at various temperatures (25–45 °C) and sampled over time.
Then, the samples were assayed for enzyme activity at 25 °C.
The experiments were performed in triplicate, and the error bars indicate
standard error.

Measurement of Kinetic
Parameters
Luciferase activity
in the presence of varying concentrations of d-luciferin
was measured in the presence of the enzyme (0.44 μg/mL) and
excess ATP (2 mM) at 25 °C. The Ppy luciferase reaction kinetics
is characterized by initial burst of light (flash) upon substrate
addition followed by the steady “glow” phase because
of product inhibition (Figure S2).22 In this study, light intensity measured 5 min
after the start of the reaction was used as the reference point for
activity because the glow phase of the luciferase light output would
be more representative of the pseudo-steady state of the luciferase
reactions relevant to bioimaging applications. The activity profile
over different d-luciferin concentrations was fitted to the
standard Michaelis–Menten equation to calculate the apparent Km and kcat values
for the substrate (Figure 3, Table 1).
It should be noted that because luminescence intensity is measured
instead of the product concentration, the calculated Km and kcat values are apparent
or relative values based on the luminescence measurement.

a Apparent kcat values
were obtained by dividing the calculated apparent Vmax(cps) by the luciferase concentration (7
nM).

The LGR mutant showed
a lower apparent Km value of 0.76 μM
than that of the WT (1.21 μM). Although
Noda et al. reported a more dramatic decrease in Km of the LGR mutant (>20-fold reduction relative to
the
WT), it should be noted that they used different measurement conditions,
for example, lower ATP concentration (10 μM) and the timing
of luminescence measurement (5 s). Consistent with the previous reports,
we observed approximately 4-fold increase in the apparent kcat relative to the WT (Table 1).

In contrast, Mutant E displayed
an apparent Km value that is 7.3-fold
higher than that of the WT (Figure 3, Table 1). However, the apparent kcat was higher
than that of the WT or the LGR
mutant. Therefore, although Mutant E shows higher maximum activity
(Vmax) at high d-luciferin concentrations,
its activity at low d-luciferin concentrations (below 4 μM)
lags behind that of the LGR mutant (Figure 3E).

The YY5 mutant shows an apparent Km that is lower than Mutant E (4.2 μM)
and the highest apparent kcat among all
variants. Although the Km value is higher
than those of the WT and the
LGR mutant, the improved activity makes YY5 the most active luciferase
at 2 μM d-luciferin concentration (Figure 3E).

Structural Analysis
The crystal structure of the WT
Ppy luciferase23 (PDB ID: 1BA3) was used to
visualize the relative positions of the mutations that were incorporated
into YY5 (Figure 4).
The luciferase structure is divided into the large N-terminal and
the small C-terminal domains, which are connected by a short linker.
The three substitutions (I423L, D436G, and L530R) that comprise the
LGR mutant are localized in the vicinity of the interface of the two
domains where the substrates are bound, which is consistent with their
effects on Km and kcat values.19,20 The mutations that confer thermostability
in Mutant E (T214A, A215L, I232A, F295L, and E345K), however, are
all located in the N-terminal domain distant from the active site.24 Consequently, it is reasonable that the two
sets of mutations do not interfere with the respective phenotypes
when combined in YY5.

reported
crystal structure of the Ppy luciferase. Protein Data Bank file 1BA3 was obtained
and analyzed by PyMOL. The N-terminal domain is shown in yellow, and
the C-terminal domain is shown in green. The amino acid mutations
derived from LGR and Mutant E are indicated in red and purple, respectively.

Conclusions
Over
the years, luciferases have been engineered for various applications
in chemistry and biology.11 In particular,
the Ppy luciferase remains the most popular bioluminescence reporter
for bioimaging applications. However, most protein engineering efforts
on the Ppy luciferase have focused on improving or altering a specific
property, for example, thermostability, emission spectrum, or catalytic
activity. Combinations of the mutations that confer distinct characteristics
could further enhance the practical utility of the luciferase for
reporter gene applications. For example, Branchini et al. incorporated
a set of thermostabilizing mutations into color mutants of Ppy luciferase.21

Our objective was to construct a firefly
luciferase mutant with
higher activity (lower Km and higher kcat values) and higher thermostability by combining
the characteristics of the previously reported mutations for each
property. Through in vitro biochemical assays of the WT and the variants
(LGR, Mutant E, and YY5), we demonstrated that the new mutant YY5
displays improved luminescence activity at low d-luciferin
concentrations. As it has been suggested that the low cellular permeability
of d-luciferin is a limiting factor in bioimaging applications
of the firefly luciferase, YY5 may be useful for such applications.

Methods
Plasmid
Construction
The WT luciferase and its variants
were cloned into pTrcHis2 vector (Thermo Fisher) by standard molecular
biology techniques and sequence verified by Sanger sequencing. The
plasmid map and the DNA sequence of the expression cassette are provided
in the Supporting Information (Figures
S3, S4, and S5).

Expression and Purification of Luciferase
Variants
The luciferase expression plasmids were transformed
into E. coli BL21(DE3) competent cells
(Novagen). The
plasmid-containing cells were cultured in 50 mL of terrific broth
supplemented with ampicillin (50 μg/mL) at 200 rpm and 37 °C.
Protein expression was induced by the addition of isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside (0.1 mM for WT and LGR, 0.4 mM for
Mutant E and YY5) when the OD600 value reached 0.6. Then,
the cells were cultured for 16 h at 200 rpm and 28 °C.

The cells were centrifuged (Beckman Coulter, Allegra 6KR) at 10 000
rpm for 20 min at 4 °C, and the cell pellet was resuspended in
1 mL of the lysis buffer (50 mM Tris–HCl pH 7.5, 5% glycerol,
1 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride).
The cells were lysed by adding a stock solution of lysozyme to the
final concentration of 300 μg/mL and incubated for 16 hours.
The lysate was treated with 0.5 U/μL Benzonase Nuclease (Sigma-Aldrich)
for 30 min at 4 °C. Then, the cell lysate was centrifuged (Eppendorf
5415D) at 13 000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant
was applied to the His-Spin Protein Miniprep kit (Zymo Research) following
the manufacturer’s instructions.

The purified enzyme
solution was dialyzed against a 50 mM Tris–HCl
buffer (pH 7.8) using concentrator tubes with a molecular weight cut-off
value of 50 kDa (Amicon Ultra-15 EMD Millipore). The enzymes were
analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Figure S1), and protein
concentrations were determined using the Micro BCA Protein Assay Kit
(Thermo Fisher Scientific). The purified enzymes were stored in 50%
glycerol (v/v) solution at −20 °C until use.

Measurement
of Luminescence Spectra
To characterize
the luminescence spectra of the luciferase variants, individual buffered
solutions containing DTT, bovine serum albumin (BSA), MgCl2, Tris–HCl, and each enzyme were prepared at pH 7.8. The reaction
solutions were prepared in 1 mL quartz cuvettes by combining 400 μL
of the buffered enzyme solution with 100 μL of a d-luciferin
stock solution (500 μM) and 500 μL of an ATP stock solution
(4 mM). The final concentrations of each component in the reactions
were 0.5 mM DTT, 0.1 mg/mL BSA, 2.5 mM MgCl2, 50 mM Tris–HCl,
1.6 μg/mL enzyme, 50 μM d-luciferin, and 2 mM
ATP. Luminescence spectra were acquired by scanning from 400 to 800
nm at room temperature using the Fluorolog-3 spectrofluorometer (HORIBA).

Thermostability Assay
The thermostability assays were
set up by first preparing an 8 mL buffered enzyme solution at pH 7.8
that contained 1.3 mM DTT, 0.3 mg/mL BSA, 6.3 mM of MgCl2, and 125 mM Tris–HCl. Aliquots of 50 μL of buffered
enzyme solutions were incubated at temperatures ranging from 25 to
45 °C in triplicate using a thermal cycler (T-100, Bio-Rad).
The enzyme solutions were removed from the thermal cycler at appropriate
time intervals and were kept on ice until luminescence measurement.
Luciferase activity was measured using the Tecan Infinite M1000 PRO
microplate reader equipped with an autoinjector module. The incubated
enzyme solutions (40 μL) were mixed with 400 μM d-luciferin stock solution (10 μL) in 96-well microplate wells.
Luciferase reaction was started by injecting 50 μL of ATP stock
solution (4 mM), and the luminescence intensity 5 min after injection
was recorded. The final concentrations in the reaction were 0.5 mM
DTT, 0.1 mg/mL BSA, 2.5 mM MgCl2, 50 mM Tris–HCl,
0.44 μg/mL (7 nM) enzyme, 2 mM ATP, and 40 μM d-luciferin.

Determination of Kinetic Parameters
Preliminary assays
were performed using different ATP concentrations ranging from 10
μM to 6 mM, and 2 mM ATP was found to be sufficient to saturate
the luciferase activity under our assay conditions (data not shown).
Luciferase assay was performed as described above for thermostability
assay except that different concentrations (0–60 μM)
of d-luciferin were used. Each reaction was performed in
quadruplicate. Luminescence intensity values at the 5 min time point
following ATP injection were recorded as the apparent activity, which
was used to plot the graphs shown in Figure 3. The data were fitted to the Michaelis–Menten
equation using the software GraphPad Prism 6 (GraphPad Software) to
calculate apparent Km and kcat values.
