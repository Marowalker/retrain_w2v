The
application of superabsorbent polymers (SAPs) is hindered because
their absorption capability is greatly affected by the electrolytes
in a solution. A novel modified water-absorbent polymer was fabricated
by solution polymerization of sulfamic acid-modified starch and acrylic
acid; the swelling ratios of this absorbent polymer were 1026 g/g
in deionized water and 145 g/g in 0.9% sodium chloride solution and
increased by 99.5 and 13.4%, respectively, when compared with ordinary
starch-grafted acrylic SAPs. The water absorption capacity was measured
in water at different pH values, salt concentrations, and temperatures.
In addition, water and fertilizer retentions were studied by simulated
leaching tests in a soil column. The results showed that water absorption
capacities of the modified SAP in salt solutions were improved due
to the adsorption and transfer of water molecules by the sulfonic
acid groups. Compared to the losses when there was no superabsorbent
treatment, the water, nitrate, ammonium nitrogen, and water-soluble
potassium losses during the salt-tolerant superabsorbent treatment
were significantly reduced by 18.5, 22.8, 88.0, and 63.8%, respectively.
The method introduced in this study could guide the development and
wide application of salt-tolerant SAPs in agriculture and horticulture.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Superabsorbent polymers
(SAPs) typically consist of crosslinked
linear (or branched) hydrophilic polymers with three-dimensional networks
that can absorb large quantities [swelling ratio (SR) > 100] of
water
or biological fluids,1 and because of this
characteristic, SAPs have been widely used in medical and health applications,2 sewage treatment,3 and water conservation.4 When SAPs are
applied to soil, the soil surface water evaporation and water infiltration
could be reduced,5 and soil porosity and
soil structural stability could be improved;6 SAPs could also reduce soil bulk density, improve water use efficiency,
and improve soil synchrony and carbon assimilation rate in the early
stage of plant growth.7 SAPs could also
improve the utilization efficiency of granular fertilizer,8,9 so that the absorbent polymers are also widely used in agriculture
and forestry. Typically, water-absorbing polymers undergo swelling
in three stages. First, the surface of the polymer is wetted by contact
with water molecules, which are combined with the hydrophilic groups
on the surface.10 Second, the water molecules
enter the micropores in the polymer molecules, which results in an
increase in the molecular volume of the polymer.11 In the third stage, the binding force of the molecular
skeleton and the osmotic pressure of water reach an equilibrium state,
and the maximum water absorption capacity and volume of the polymer
is achieved.1

However, the hydrophilic
groups inside the polymer bind salt ions
easily by a mechanism similar to complexation.3 Therefore, the network structures are blocked, hindering the entry
of water molecules in the first and second stages and volume expansion
of the polymer in the third stage. Consequently, the water absorption
capacity decreases sharply in water-containing electrolytes, such
as urine,12 blood,13 or soil solutions.14 Furthermore, these
polymers are not easily degraded and might cause harm to humans and
the environment because they are often made from petrochemical materials.10 To solve these problems, previous researchers
found that increasing the number and type of hydrophilic groups could
improve the salt tolerance.1 Natural organic
polymer materials that have hydrophilic groups, such as starch, fiber,
chitosan derivatives,15−17 and minerals (clay, montmorillonite, etc.)18−20 could be used to improve the degradability and salt tolerance of
these materials.

Starch, a natural bioresource formed by the
polymerization of glucose
molecules, is among the most widely used polysaccharides in SAP production.1 However, most starch-based SAPs still suffer
from poor water absorption and low salt tolerance.15 Peng et al. prepared SAPs from sodium-starch sulfonate
and acrylic acid and improved the SR in deionized water. However,
sodium-starch sulfonate was prepared by synthesizing a complex intermediate
via a 2-step method.21 When the starch
was treated by the highly polar intermediate complex, its structure
could be destroyed. The water absorption of the final product was
only 91 g/g in physiological saline, demonstrating its low salt tolerance.
Furthermore, solvents used in the synthesis, such as acetone, could
cause harm to humans and the environment. Acid-treated starch is prepared
by treating starch or starch granules with inorganic acids,22 which break the long chains into short chains
without changing the structure. Sulfamic acid is a moderately strong
acid and might be considered to be an intermediate compound between
sulfuric acid and sulfamide. It has desirable water descaling properties,
low volatility, and low toxicity compared to most common strong mineral
acids.23 Moreover, when sulfamic acid is
used as a modifier to treat starch, the number of strongly hydrophilic
sulfonic acid groups can be increased to obtain acid-modified starch.
It is hypothesized that using acid-modified starch might improve the
hydrophilicity and salt tolerance of starch-based SAPs. Based on the
literature,22 acid-modified starch is commonly
used in food science; however, none of these studies attempted SAP
synthesis.

To reduce the effects of salts on SAPs by exploiting
the unique
groups and structures of acid-modified starches, a simple novel method
for preparing a water-absorbing polymer by an aqueous polymerization
process was developed. The number of sulfonic acid groups was higher
in the acid-denatured starch, thereby providing the SAPs with salt
tolerance and a high water absorption capacity and expanding their
application range.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Swelling Kinetics and Effects of the Simulated
Application Conditions on the SR of the Salt-Tolerant Superabsorbent
Polymer
To determine the mechanism and rate of salt-tolerant
superabsorbent polymer (STSP) swelling in deionized water, a swelling
kinetic study was performed by applying pseudo-first-order and pseudo-second-order
kinetic models. SRC was the convergence value of the equation
and could therefore be regarded as the maximum water absorption capacity
in an ideal state. The k1 and k2 values were related to the speed of absorption
and expansion, a characteristic exponent of the swollen polymer.29 The results indicated that the swelling of the
commercial superabsorbent polymer (CSAP) and starch-grafted superabsorbent
polymer (SGSP) in deionized water followed pseudo-second-order kinetics
(Figure 1a) because
the R2 values for this model (0.9679 and
0.9861) were higher than those for the pseudo-first-order model (0.9620
and 0.9859) (Table 1). This result indicated that the swelling of the SAPs was a multistep
process; water molecules were first attracted to the hydrophilic groups
and then moved inward along the molecular voids, whereas the SAP molecules
expanded in volume to accommodate more water molecules. Eventually,
the osmotic pressure inside and outside the SAP molecule reached equilibrium.
However, the results for the STSP were different. The R2 value (0.9749) for the pseudo-first-order model was
significantly higher than R2 (0.9256)
for the pseudo-second-order model (Table 1), indicating that at the macroscopic scale,
the swelling of the STSP was a single process. The maximum SR of the
STSP was significantly higher than those of the CSAP and SGSP, and
its water absorption rate was lower than those of the CSAP and SGSP
(Figure 1a). This phenomenon
was probably due to the greater number of interconnected porous channels
within the STSP molecular network compared to the CSAP or SGSP, which
delayed the penetration of water molecules into the hydrogel and thus
increased the time required to reach the equilibrium swelling capacity.
It was hypothesized that the swelling process of the STSP was actually
a multistep process. However, the steps were approximately simultaneous,
which caused the swelling of the STSP to exhibit the macroscopic characteristics
of a pseudo-first-order reaction.30

 	pseudo-second-order	SRC = 277.78	k2 = 4.5 × 10–4	0.9679

 	pseudo-second-order	SRC = 1240.84	k2 = 2.0 × 10–5	0.9256	
The SRs of the SGSP and STSP were significantly
higher than that
of the CSAP in deionized water at different pH values and salt contents,
and the highest values were 1020 and 514 g/g, respectively, at pH
7–8 (Figure 1b). The SRs of the three SPs decreased with increasing salt concentration
(Figure 1c). Moreover,
the SR of the STSP was significantly affected by the pH. Temperature
had the smallest effect on the SR of the SGSP in deionized water,
and the SR of the STSP decreased significantly when the temperature
was higher than 45 °C (Figure 1d). This result was probably due to temperature effects
on the diffusion coefficient of water.28 At higher temperatures, the molecular motion increased. Because
the molecular skeleton of the STSP was acid-treated to obtain short-chain
starch,22 it was less stable than the starch
skeleton of the SGSP and the polyolefin skeleton of the CSAP at higher
temperatures. However, this short-chain skeleton might improve the
degradation ability of the STSP and would decrease environmental pollution.
It is rare to reach high temperatures above 45 °C under the conditions
of real natural soil applications. Therefore, within a reasonable
range, the STSP still exhibited a higher performance than the SGSP
and CSAP.

2.2 Structure and Characterization of the SGSP
and STSP
The FTIR spectroscopy results showed that the STSP
(Figure 2a), SGSP (Figure 2b), acid-modified
starch (Figure 2c),
and starch (Figure 2d), all had strong, broad absorption peaks at 3300–3500 cm–1 and a weak absorption peak at 1600–1650 cm–1 (Figure 2), which corresponds to the vibrational and scissoring vibration
absorption characteristics of −OH30 and is the main characteristic absorption peak of starch. The STSP
and acid-modified starch exhibited obvious absorption peaks at 1205
and 800 cm–1 (Figure 2a,c), which are the characteristic symmetric vibrations
of −SO3H31 and characteristic
vibrations of C–S,32 respectively.
The STSP also had a vibrational absorption peak attributed to C=O30 at 1720 cm–1 and an asymmetric
vibration absorption peak corresponding to SO3H33 at 1400 cm–1 (Figure 2a). The acid-modified starch
had a symmetric vibration absorption peak due to SO3H at
1180 cm–1 (Figure 2c), and these absorption peaks were not observed in
the SGSP and starch spectra (Figure 2b,d), which indicates that the sulfonic acid group
was added to the starch molecule by the modification treatment and
was retained in the STSP. These results were consistent with the energy-dispersive
X-ray spectra (Figure 3a,b); the amounts of sulfur and oxygen in the STSP sample were higher.

transform infrared spectra of a (a) STSP, (b) SGSP, (c)
modified short-chain starch, and (d) starch.

Figure 3 Energy-dispersive spectra of a (a) SGSP and (b) STSP.

The microstructures of the SGSP and STSP in the
equilibrium swelling
state in deionized water were almost the same, but the surface of
the STSP was smoother and denser. The equilibrium swelling states
in physiological saline were significantly different. The microscopic
pores of the SGSP were almost completely filled with salt. These salt
crystals hindered the entry of water molecules and the expansion of
the SGSP molecules, thereby reducing the water absorption capacity.
The microscopic network structure of the STSP was largely retained,
and salt crystals covered only a small part of the surface. This result
was due to the introduction of various hydrophilic groups (especially
sulfonic acid groups). When the STSP swelled in a salt solution, the
water molecules were first adsorbed by the sulfonic acid groups and
transferred to adjacent sulfonic acid groups,33,34 which led to a much higher water transport rate compared to the
salt diffusion rate. Inside the equilibrium swollen STSP, the salt
content was much lower than in the external solution. Thus, at the
microscopic level, the salt crystallization inside the STSP was much
less than that inside the SGSP (Figure 4).

water, (b) STSP in deionized water, (c) SGSP in saline water, and

2.3 Effects of the Synthesis Conditions on the
STSP SR
In an acid environment, the starch became a short-chain
molecule, and the number of hydrophilic groups increased. The amounts
of the modifiers affected the formation of the small molecules, and
the water absorption ability of the final polymer was also affected.
With increasing modifier dosage, the water absorption capacity first
increased and then decreased, and the absorption capacity in normal
saline also increased significantly. When the mass dosage of the modifier
was 1.2% of the starch mass, the maximum water absorption capacity
was achieved (Figure 5a).

Figure 5 SRs [mass after complete swelling divided by the dry weight (g/g)]
for different synthesis conditions: (a) aminosulfonic acid: starch
(%), (b) m (acrylic acid): m (acid-modified starch), (c) neutralization
degree of acrylic acid, (d) ammonium persulfate: acrylic acid (%),
and (e) N,N′-methylene bisacrylamide
(MBA): acrylic acid (%).

Acrylic acid was grafted onto the starch to serve as a binding
site for the backbone. The proportion of modified starch and acrylic
acid also affected the water absorption capacity of the polymer.27 When the proportion of starch was higher, the
number of intermolecular bonding points decreased, and the polymer
pores were enlarged. Accordingly, the contact density of the hydrophilic
groups with water was reduced, leading to a decrease in the SR. When
the ratio of starch was too low, the molecular skeleton was tightly
bound, and the swelling was limited. The optimal mass ratio of modified
starch to acrylic acid was 1:7.5 (Figure 5b).

Acrylic acid was partially neutralized
to form sodium acrylate.
During polymerization in the aqueous solution, sodium propanoate was
present in the dissociated carboxylate salt form.35 At a higher degree of dissociation, the molecular chain
was extended moderately, and the formation of the polymerization network
was favorable. The results indicated that at 70% neutralization, the
absorption function was at a maximum (Figure 5c). According to Flory’s polymer swelling
theory,36 as the degree of crosslinking
increased, the swelling capacity decreased. The SR was also affected
by the initiator and the crosslinking agent. The maximum water absorbency
was achieved with 3% ammonium persulfate (APS) and 0.15% MBA [percent
of acrylic acid (AA) mass] (Figure 5d,e).

2.4 Effects of the STSP on
Water and Fertilizer
Leaching in Soil Columns
The water absorption capacities
of the three SAPs were directly reflected by the total volume of the
leachate. Without fertilizer in the CKSAP (control check adding superabsorbent
polymers) treatment, the maximal water absorption capacity of the
STSP and smallest leachate volume were observed (Figure 6a). The CKF (control check
adding fertilizer) treatment, which did not include a SAP, could be
considered to give the water retention capacity of the soil itself.
Compared to the CKF treatment, the water loss was decreased by 11.1,
12.5, and 18.5% with the CSAP, SGSP, and STSP treatments, respectively,
which demonstrated that all three SAPs effectively reduced water loss
(Figure 6a).

Bar heights represent means and error bars represent ±SE. Within
each graph, means followed with the same letter were not significantly
different based on a one-way ANOVA followed by Duncan’s multiple-range
tests (P > 0.05).

Nitrogen is one of the most important nutrient elements in
agricultural
production.37 Soil fertility can be directly
reflected by the nitrate and ammonium nitrogen concentrations in the
soil. Nevertheless, nitrogen is easily leached. The CKSAP treatment
with STSP application but no fertilizer resulted in very little leaching
(Figure 6b). The CKF
treatment could be considered to show the leaching loss under normal
conditions. The leaching losses of nitrate nitrogen for the SGSP and
STSP treatments were significantly reduced by 22.3 and 22.8%, respectively,
compared to that of the CKF treatment, but the difference between
the CSAP and CKF treatment results was not significant (Figure 6b). The ammonium nitrogen leaching
losses for the CSAP, SGSP, and STSP treatments were significantly
reduced by 51.6, 72.4, and 88.0%, respectively, compared to that for
CKF (Figure 6c), probably
because the soil was negatively charged and the internal hydrophilic
groups of SAPs were also anionic.38 Inside
the SAP, the cation (K+, NH4+, and
so on) was combined with the hydrophilic group by a method which was
similar with complexation,39 but with weak
ionic bonds, no coordinate bond was formed and because the larger
the hydration radius, greater is the positive charge, which came to
the stronger of the generated ionic bonds.40 When the ion concentration outside the SAPs was low, the bound cation
could also diffuse outward, thus causing the absorption and release
characteristics of nutrients.

Potassium is also an important
nutrient element in agricultural
production. The potassium leaching losses for the CSAP, SGSP, and
STSP were significantly reduced by 57.3, 18.8, and 63.8%, respectively,
compared to that for CKF (Figure 6d). It should be noted that the potassium ion leaching
was higher with the SGSP than with the CSAP and STSP, which might
be due to the large amount of sodium ions between the SGSP and STSP
molecules (Figure 3a,b). The sodium ions and potassium ions from the soil and fertilizer
competed in the processes of adsorption and migration.41 Because the SGSP had fewer hydrophilic groups
than the STSP, the binding of the sodium ions was weaker in the SGSP
than in the STSP. The sodium ions in the SGSP were partially eluted
and replaced the potassium ions at the adsorption sites in the soil,
which led directly to higher potassium ion leaching during the SGSP
treatment than during the STSP treatment.

3 Conclusions
A biobased SAP was successfully synthesized from acid-denatured
starch and acrylic acid. The prepared copolymer had a different structure
and swelling characteristics than ordinary starch-grafted acrylic
acid, and it exhibited excellent water absorption and salt tolerance
with SRs of 1026 g/g in deionized water and 155 g/g in a 0.9% sodium
chloride solution. Water, nitrate, ammonium nitrogen and water-soluble
potassium losses were significantly reduced by 18.5, 22.8, 88.0, and
63.8%, respectively, when the STSP treatment was applied instead of
the CKF treatment in simulated soil column tests. This novel polymer
has great potential for large-scale commercial applications and might
have broad applications in agriculture and forestry.

4 Materials and Methods
4.1 Materials
Soluble
starch and APS
(analytical grade) were obtained from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co.,
Ltd. (Shanghai, China). AA (chemically pure), amino sulfonic acid
(ASA, analytical grade), and MBA (chemically pure) were analytical
grade and purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. (Shanghai,
China), and Moisture Plus Watering Crystals (Schultz, Wisconsin, America),
which are white translucent solid particles with SR of 1026 g/g in
deionized water and 155 g/g in 0.9% sodium chloride solution, were
employed as the CSAP.

4.2 Syntheses of the STSP and
SGSP
Soluble
starch was dissolved in deionized water to a mass concentration at
40% and homogenized in a glass beaker. The mixture was heated at 50
°C in a water bath with mechanical agitation for 2 h. The starch
homogenate was poured into flat plates, oven-dried at 50 °C for
2 h, and then ground to a powder. Then, the starch homogenate powder
was mixed with water in a powder: water mass ratio of 0.4:1 in a three-neck
flask. The initiator ammonium persulfate was added to the starch homogenate
mixture. The resulting solution was stirred and heated at 50 °C.
Acrylic acid, which was 6–12 times the weight of the added
starch, was neutralized with a 5 mol/L sodium hydroxide solution at
0 °C and then added to the starch homogenate mixture. MBA was
added as a crosslinker, and the reaction was performed in a water
bath at 50 °C for 1 h. Nitrogen gas was inserted for protective
purpose during the entire reaction process. After 2 h, the thick colloidal
crude product mixture was washed with deionized water to remove the
unreacted monomer. It was then dried at 50 °C in a blast dryer
(60–72 h) and crushed by a stainless steel pulverizer with
10–20 mesh sieves.

To prepare the SGSP, soluble starch
was used as the raw material, and it was not treated with ASA. The
rest of the synthesis steps were exactly the same as those for the
STSP.

4.3 Measurements of Swelling Capacity of the SGSP,
STSP, and CSAP
The SR was measured using the tea bag method1 in which a certain mass (M1) of the dry material was fully soaked in deionized water.
After complete expansion, it was removed and held until water was
no longer dripping from the bag. The weight of the soaked STSP (M2) was recorded, and the SR was calculated using
the following formula: SR = (M2 – M1)/M1, where M1 and M2 are the
weights of the dry and swollen samples (g), respectively. The expansion
kinetic equation fitting was performed by measuring the SR at 10,
20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 90, 120, 150, 210, 390, and 600 min after soaking.
The SRs of the three SAPs (CSAP, SGSP, and STSP) were measured at
pH values of 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10; sodium ion concentrations
of 0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, and 1.0%; and temperatures
of 5, 15, 25, 35, 45, 55, and 65 °C.

4.4 Characterization
of the STSP and SGSP
FTIR spectra were obtained on a Nicolet
6700 FTIR spectrometer (Nicolet,
Waltham, America). The SEM images and energy spectra were obtained
on a Tecnai G2-F20 transmission electron microscope (EFIS-TWIN, Hillsboro,
America) using freeze-dried samples.

4.5 Measurement
of Water and Nutrient Retention
The soil for these experiments
was sampled from Taian, Shandong,
China (117°9′48″E, 36°9′40″N)
and was classified as a Typic Hapli-Udic Argosol24 and a Typic Hapludalf.25 The
basic physicochemical properties of the soil are: organic matter,
11.7 g/kg; NH4–N, 13.8 mg/kg; NO3–N,
28.2 mg/kg; Olsen-P, 65.6 mg/kg; and water-soluble potassium, 168
mg/kg. The soil was air-dried and passed through a 2 mm sieve. A compound
fertilizer (N–P2O5–K2O 21–8–11, BASF, Germany) was used.

Single factor
design was used in this experiment. CKSAP indicated no fertilizer;
CKF indicated no SAP (control treatment); and CSAP, SGSP, and STSP
indicated the separate treatments with one of the three SAPs (CSAP,
SGSP, and STSP, respectively) and the same amount of fertilizer.

The columns were constructed from polyvinyl chloride (PVC) tubes,
each with a diameter of 7.5 cm and length of 60 cm. Then, nylon mesh
was fixed at the bottom of each PVC tube. First, 1 kg soil was packed
into the bottom of the soil column and compacted. Then, 1 kg soil
completely mixed with 6.00 g fertilizer and 3.75 g SAP was loaded
into the soil column. The soil bulk density was 1.299 g/cm3, and the soil volume was 1540 cm3. Finally, irrigation
was performed four times. The water volume of each irrigation was
100% of the soil pore volume, and the leaching solution was collected
until no liquid continued to flow out of the soil column. The leachate
volume and NO3––N, NH4+–N and water-soluble potassium contents were determined
by flow analyzer (AA-3, SEAL, Germany) and flame photometer (M410
Sherwood, United Kingdom).14

4.6 Data Analyses
All experiments and
analytical measurements were conducted in triplicate. The mean values
are shown in the plotted data with the standard deviation represented
by error bars. A paired sample t-test analysis was
conducted using SAS 8.1 to evaluate whether the differences between
the means were significant (P < 0.05).

To
evaluate and compare the swelling characteristics of the materials,
pseudo-first-order and pseudo-second-order26 equations were used to simulate the experimental kinetic data    where SRt (g/g)
and SRC (g/g) are the cumulative ratios of swelling at
time, t and at equilibrium, respectively, and k1 (min–1) and k2 [g/(g·min)] are the first- and second-order swelling
rate constants, respectively.
