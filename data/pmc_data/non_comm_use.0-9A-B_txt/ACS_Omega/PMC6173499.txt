Development
of a chiral pool-based synthesis of 10b-aza-analogues
of biologically active Amaryllidaceae alkaloids is described, involving a concise reductive amination
and condensation sequence, leading to ring-B/C-modified, fully functionalized
ring-C derivatives. Differentiated anticancer and antiviral activities
of these analogues are presented. Despite complete conformational
and functional group overlap, the 10b-aza-analogues
have diminished anticancer activity and no antiviral activity. These
unprecedented electronic effects suggest a possible role for π-type
secondary orbital interactions with the biological target.

1 Introduction
Amaryllidaceae alkaloids have attracted
the attention of medicinal1−4 and synthetic organic chemists5−8 for many decades in view of the
diverse array of biological activities demonstrated. Examples include
(Figure 1A) galanthamine
(1) used clinically in the treatment of Alzheimer’s
disease,9 the anticancer agent pancratistatin
(2),10 and the selective anticancer/antiviral
agents trans-dihydronarciclasine (3)11,12 and trans-dihydrolycoricidine (4).13 The latter two alkaloids have recently been
reported to exhibit potent activity against Zika virus,12 herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1), and varicella
zoster virus.13

the novel hybrid heterocycle 6 and proposed
retrosynthesis from an anthranilamide 7, and pentose l-arabinose (8).

Despite the common structural motifs apparent in compounds 1–4, these biological activities manifest through diverse
mechanisms. Galanthamine is a potent inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase,14 whereas pancratistatin selectively targets cancer
cell mitochondria.15 The antiviral profile
is unusual with potent activity being reported against both DNA and
RNA viruses,11−13 and accordingly several antiviral targets have been
postulated.16,17 Significant efforts have been
made to elucidate the anticancer pharmacophore of pancratistatin.
This work has revealed that ring-A substituents and the stereochemistry
of ring-C substituents are crucial for activity,18−22 leading to the identification of analogues that are
more potent than the natural products.23,24 The ring-A
7-aza-analogue proved to be devoid of anticancer activity,25 while the 10-aza-analogue was potent,26 demonstrating the importance of the evaluation
of aza analogues in revealing the subtle electronic requirements of
the pharmacophore. The contribution of structural modifications on
the antiviral activity is also critical13 but much less established.11−13 Only a single report on the structure–activity
relationship of ring-B modified lycoranes (dengue virus) has appeared.27

The potent, selective antiviral activity
of a series of quinazolinone
derivatives (Figure 1, 5) was recently reported against HSV-1.28,30 These compounds are accessible via a one-pot multicomponent coupling
reaction of an amine, an aldehyde, and an anthranilamide derivative.
High selectivity was observed for anti-HSV-1 activity in neuronal
host cells for both compound 4 and the quinazolinones.13,26 Given the synthetic challenges associated with the synthesis of
fully functionalized alkaloids such as 3 and 4,5−8,12,29 we have now explored a new hybrid quinazolinone–lycorane
heterocyclic core shown as structure 6 (Figure 1). We envisioned that compounds
such as 6 could be elaborated in an asymmetric fashion
from an anthranilamide such as 7 and a chiral-pool pentose
(such as 8) in a few steps. In this communication, we
report the success of this route and rapid synthesis of the compound
of structural type 6, including 21 which
is the 10b-aza-analogue of the potent antiviral agent trans-dihydrolycoricidine (4), from l-arabinose in six steps (carried out in four chemical procedures)
with a 23% overall yield.

2 Results and Discussion
Two initial attempts to fuse pentoses such as d-ribose
and l-arabinose onto anthranilamide 7b through
N-alkylation of the protected 5-iodo analogues failed due to chemoselectivity
incompatibilities, and we eventually settled on the process outlined
in Schemes 1–3. The C5 primary alcohol of l-arabinose, possessing the desired stereochemistry, was selectively
protected as the TBS–ether 9 (Scheme 1), which, due to its hydrophilicity,
was immediately engaged in the reductive amination with anthranilamide 7b in the same reaction vessel affording intermediate 10. After a short solvent partition sequence, the crude triol 10 was acylated to give 11, which was isolated
and purified over silica. The overall three-stage telescoped reaction
sequence was highly efficient giving access to 11 with
64% overall yield (based on l-arabinose) over three steps,
requiring only a single silica-gel chromatographic purification.

Removal of the TBS-protecting group in 11 employing
tetrabutylammonium fluoride in THF gave the primary alcohol 12 contaminated with products of acetyl migration, attributed
to these basic conditions. Conversely, the use of HF·pyridine
complex in THF resulted in clean deprotection with no acyl transfer,
and the desired primary alcohol 12 was isolated in high
yield (Scheme 2). The
selective oxidation of the primary alcohol to the aldehyde proved
more challenging than expected and a number of different conditions
were investigated. An attempted Swern oxidation unexpectedly resulted
in dehydration of the amide in 12 leading to the nitrile
derivative, while an attempted oxidation under Parikh–Doering
conditions failed completely, and no conversion of the starting material
was observed. Reaction of 12 using Dess–Martin
periodinane resulted in rapid decomposition of the starting material.
Finally, oxidation with IBX in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) at 60 °C
was found to proceed selectively, the intermediate aldehyde immediately
condensing as expected,28 to give the desired
fused-ring products 13 and 14 as a 1:2 mixture
of separable diastereomers. Saponification of each of the separated
diastereomers with K2CO3 in MeOH afforded the
desired individual triols 15 and 16 completing
the synthesis of these new hybrid model compounds.
We also determined that, separately, 13 and 14 do not interconvert under the cyclization conditions, indicating
them to be the products of a kinetically controlled intramolecular
condensation.

A single crystal X-ray structural analysis of
the major diastereomer 14 was conducted, confirming the
overall course of the chemistry
as anticipated and confirming the stereochemistry of the major diastereomer
as shown in Scheme 2. Interestingly, the 10b-aza heterocycle 14 was seen to adopt the alternative chair conformer
as normally observed in the carbocyclic natural series. The C2- and
C3-acetoxy and 4a-amino substituents of 14 adopt equatorial positions while the C4-acetoxy group projects axially.
Diastereomer 14 crystallized as the thermodynamically
more stable one of its chair conformers. A crystal structure of diastereomer 13 or deacetylated product 15 could not be obtained;
however, the 1H NMR spectra of 15 is consistent
(H4a, δ 4.59, d, J = 9.0 Hz)
with the adoption of the natural phenanthridone-type chair conformer,
having equatorial C4-hydroxyl and 4a-amino and diaxial
C2, C3 alcohols. Thus, the diastereomeric pairs 13/14 or 15/16 adopt radically different
three-dimensional projections of the crucial ring-C substituents with
diastereomers 13 and 15 (and 19 and 21 vide infra) matching those of biologically active
compounds such as 4.

The synthetic route was now
repeated with the 3,4-methylenedioxy-substituted
anthranilamide 7a (Scheme 3), essentially as before. The three-step telescoped
intermediate 17 was isolated in a highly efficient 68%
yield. Desilylation of 17 and IBX-mediated oxidation
of 18 gave two ring-fused diastereomers 19 and 20 in a ratio of 3:4 (by mass). These diastereomers
also proved readily separable over the silica gel, and each compound
was independently saponified yielding the methylenedioxy-substituted
quinazolidinone–lycorane hybrids21 and 22. The chiral pool strategy thus allowed rapid,
convergent fusion of l-arabinose onto the substituted anthranilamides
giving access to 21, the direct 10b-aza-analogue
(Figure 1, 6) of trans-dihydrolycoricidine, and analogues 13, 14, 15, 16, 19, 20, 21, and 22 (see Scheme 3).

Preliminary
anticancer investigations have been carried out on
compound 4 and select 10b-aza-analogues.
As the ring-A methylenedioxy substituent and free ring-C hydroxyl
substituents are the known required features for anticancer activity,11 the antiproliferative activity of compound 4 and the two hydroxyl derivatives 21 and 22 was investigated in four hematopoietic cancer cell lines.
Compound 21 retained selective anticancer activity toward
Karpas422 (9.72 μM), Toledo (18.9 μM), and K562 (13.23
μM) but was inactive toward MV4-11 cell lines. As expected,
the synthetic compound 4 demonstrated potent broad-spectrum
activity to Karpas422 (0.076 μM), Toledo (0.061 μM), and
K562 (0.076 μM) and to the MV4-11 (0.073 μM) cell lines.
The diastereomer 22 proved to be devoid of anticancer
activity in all four cell lines investigated.

Preliminary anti-HSV-1
activity of select compounds has also been
investigated with sharply defined results. As shown in Figure 2, neurons infected with HSV-1
were cultured at 2 h post infection and were treated with test compounds.
While the synthetic alkaloid 4 proved to be a potent
inhibitor of HSV-1 replication as expected,13 the hybrid 10b-aza derivatives 19, 20, 21, and 22 demonstrated
no inhibition of HSV-1.28 The introduction
of the 10b-aza nitrogen in 21 was not
expected to change the ring-C conformation of the molecule significantly
in comparison to 4; however, the introduced dipole in 21 (vinylogous amide) was expected to affect the electronic
properties. Given the sharp differences observed in the anti-HSV-1
activity of the compounds 4 and 21, a detailed
conformational analysis was conducted in an attempt to separate the
electronic effects from the conformational/functional group attributes.

EGFP linked to the ICP90 promoter at MOI = 0.3; Y-axis depicts GFP+ cell percentage. Vehicle = uninfected and viral-infected
untreated cells and ACV = acyclovir-positive control.

In addition to the X-ray analysis of diastereomer 14 (see 14, Scheme 2), further evidence in support of the conformations was obtained
through investigation of density functional theory (DFT) calculations
on compounds 4, 21, and 22,
the calculated minima of which are depicted in Figure 3 (see Supporting Information). Compounds 4 and 21 adopt the natural
phenanthridone-type chair conformation in ring-C, whereas the aza-diastereomer 22 alone adopts the alternative conformer, identical to that
observed in the X-ray structure of compound 14. The antiviral
and anticancer results thus correlate with the adoption of the biased
phenanthridone-type chair conformation as a critical conformational
requirement. The differences in anti-HSV-1 activity seen between compounds 4 (cyclohexane) and 21 (vinylogous amide) are
remarkable, given the structural overlap seen. This work demonstrates
that substitution of the 10b carbon with nitrogen is not tolerated
for antiviral activity and that the natural phenanthridone-type ring-C
conformation is required for potent anticancer activity and is crucial
for antiviral activity. The structure–activity dichotomy between
structures 4 and 21 is quite startling.
Molecular electrostatic potential heat maps (see graphical abstract)
show that 4 has an electropositive hole over ring-C,
and aza-analogue 21 is less electropositive over this
surface, highlighting a possible role of π-type secondary orbital
interactions with the antiviral target.

geometry (B3PW91/6-311+G(2d,p)) of compounds 4 (top left)
and 21 (top right) illustrating
identical ring-C phenanthridone-type conformations in contrast with
diastereomer 22 (bottom).

Position 10b in these derivatives is the only position that may potentially affect the electrostatic
potential of rings A, B, and C. The data show little effect on rings
A and B, but a significant reduction in electron density in ring-C.
The data draw attention to the different electronic distributions
within the highest occupied molecular orbitals and lowest unoccupied
molecular orbitals (see Supporting Information Figures S1–S3) of 4 and 21 as the
only differences, suggesting increasing electron density toward position
10b as a method by which selective anticancer agents
can be developed. The critical role of electronic properties (not
conformational) of ring-C in analogue 4 for potent antiviral
activity is unprecedented.

3 Conclusions
In conclusion,
we report a rapid six-step (four processes) convergent
route to quinazolinone–Amaryllidaceae alkaloid hybrid molecules. The use of readily available chiral pool
pentoses allows absolute control of three stereogenic centers and
minimizes the number of stereoselective reactions required to produce
the functionally dense core. Although there are several reports in
the literature describing the antiviral and anticancer pharmacophore
of Amaryllidaceae analogues, there
are few reports of B/C-ring fusion-modified derivatives. The selective
anticancer and antiviral activities reported here highlight the requirement
of a correct ring-C (natural phenanthridone-type) chair conformation
and reveal the unprecedented subtle role of electrostatic interactions
required for antiviral activity and potent anticancer activity. Further
studies exploring electronic modifications of fully functionalized
analogues and their selective broad-spectrum antiviral and anticancer
activities are ongoing.

4 Experimental Section
All reagents were obtained from MilliporeSigma and used as received
unless otherwise specified. THF was distilled over sodium metal with
a benzophenone indicator. Dichloromethane, methanol, and diisopropylethylamine
were distilled over calcium hydride for use in reactions performed
under anhydrous conditions. Reagent grade methanol, diethyl ether,
dichloromethane, ethyl acetate, and hexane were used without further
purification and for chromatography. Thin layer chromatography (TLC)
was performed using aluminum sheets precoated with silica gel 60F254 (MACHEREY-NAGEL) and visualized using 254 nm UV light. 1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker
AV 600 spectrometer using CDCl3 or d4-MeOH as solvents. Chemical shifts (δ) are reported
in ppm and coupling constants (J) are expressed in
hertz.

Triacetate (11)
A round-bottom flask was charged
with l-arabinose (150 mg, 1.00 mmol, 1 equiv) and pyridine
(1.20 mL, 15.0 mmol, 15 equiv). To this suspension, t-butyldimethylsilylchloride (163 mg, 1.05 mmol, 1.05 equiv) was added
in portions. This reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature
for 2 h and then concentrated to a total volume of 0.5 mL to afford
protected sugar 9. A solution of anthranilamide (130
mg, 0.95 mmol, 0.95 equiv) in dry methanol (1.0 mL) was added to the
flask. After 10 min, NaCNBH3 (120 mg, 1.91 mmol, 1.9 equiv)
was added. Upon completion of the reaction as determined by TLC (typically
5–10 min), water was added to quench the reaction mixture.
This aqueous solution was extracted with dichloromethane (3 ×
15 mL). The combined organic phase was dried over sodium sulphate
and concentrated to dryness under reduced pressure to afford the crude
product 10, which contained an inseparable sugar impurity.
In a round-bottom flask, crude 10 was dissolved in dry
dichloromethane (3.3 mL) to which were added diisopropylethylamine
(1.7 mL, 9.9 mmol, 10 equiv), acetic anhydride (566 μL, 6.0
mmol, 6 equiv), and N,N-dimethylaminopyridine
(6.0 mg, 0.05 mmol, 0.05 equiv). This reaction mixture was stirred
for 3 h at room temperature, and then quenched by the addition of
water. This aqueous solution was extracted with dichloromethane (3
× 15 mL). The combined organic phase was dried over sodium sulphate
and concentrated to dryness under reduced pressure. This material
was then purified by gradient elution silica-gel chromatography (80:20
hexane/EtOAc → 30:70 hexane/EtOAc) to afford 11 as a yellow oil in a 64% isolated yield over the three-step sequence. 1H NMR (600 MHz, CDCl3): δ 7.44 (dd, J = 7.9, 1.5 Hz, 1H), 7.36 (ddd, J = 8.6,

4.2 (2S,3R,4S)-1-((2-Carbamoylphenyl)amino)-5-hydroxypentane-2,3,4-triyl
Triacetate (12)
Compound 11 (107
mg, 0.20 mmol, 1.0 equiv) was dissolved in dry THF (3.2 mL) to which
were added HF–pyridine (274 μL). This reaction mixture
was stirred for 1 h at room temperature and then quenched by the addition
of solid NaHCO3. After 15 min, water and dichloromethane
were added to form an aqueous–organic partition. The aqueous
was extracted exhaustively with dichloromethane and then the combined
organic phases were dried with sodium sulphate and concentrated to
dryness. This afforded 12 as a pale yellow oil in 92%
yield, which was used immediately in the next transformation.

2-Iodoxybenzoic acid (12 mg,
0.043 mmol, 1.2 equiv) was dissolved in reagent grade DMSO (100 μL)
and heated to 60 °C for 30 min. A solution of compound 12 (15 mg, 0.036 mmol, 1.0 equiv) in DMSO (100 μL) was
then added. This reaction mixture was stirred for 15 min at 60 °C
and then purified directly by silica gel chromatography (100:0 Et2O/EtOAc → 90:10 Et2O/EtOAc) to afford 13 and 14 as a 1:2 mixture of diastereomers in

4.7 (2S,3R,4S)-1-((tert-Butyldimethylsilyl)oxy)-5-((6-carbamoylbenzo[d][1,3]dioxol-5-yl)amino)pentane-2,3,4-triyl Triacetate
(17)
A round-bottom flask was charged with l-arabinose (50 mg, 0.35 mmol, 1 equiv) and pyridine (400 μL,
15 mmol, 15 equiv). To this suspension, t-butyldimethylsilylchloride
(54 mg, 0.36 mmol, 1.05 equiv) was added in portions. This reaction
mixture was stirred at room temperature for 2 h, and then concentrated
to a total volume of 0.5 mL. A solution of 3,4-methylenedioxyanthranilamide
(60 mg, 0.33 mmol, 0.95 equiv) in dry methanol (320 μL) was
added to the flask. After 10 min, NaCNBH3 (42 mg, 0.66
mmol, 1.9 equiv) was added. Upon completion of the reaction as determined
by TLC (typically 2–5 min), water was added to quench the reaction
mixture. This aqueous solution was extracted with dichloromethane
(3 × 5 mL). The combined organic phase was dried over sodium
sulphate and concentrated to dryness under reduced pressure. This
mixture was dissolved in dry dichloromethane (1.0 mL) to which were
added diisopropylethylamine (575 μL, 3.3 mmol, 10 equiv), acetic
anhydride (187 μL, 1.98 mmol, 6 equiv), and N,N-dimethylaminopyridine (2.0 mg, 0.016 mmol, 0.05
equiv). This reaction mixture was stirred for 3 h at room temperature
and then quenched by the addition of water. This aqueous solution
was extracted with dichloromethane (3 × 15 mL). The combined
organic phase was dried over sodium sulphate and concentrated to dryness
under reduced pressure. This material was then purified by chromatography
(80:20 hexane/EtOAc → 30:70 hexane/EtOAc) to afford 17 as a yellow oil in a 68% isolated yield over three steps. 1H NMR (600 MHz, CDCl3): δ 6.85 (s, 1H), 6.42 (s,

4.8 (2S,3R,4S)-1-((6-Carbamoylbenzo[d][1,3]dioxol-5-yl)amino)-5-hydroxypentane-2,3,4-triyl
Triacetate (18)
Compound 17 (95
mg, 0.17 mmol, 1.0 equiv) was dissolved in dry THF (2.7 mL) to which
were added HF–pyridine (233 μL). This reaction mixture
was stirred for 20–30 min at room temperature and closely monitored
by TLC to avoid the rearrangement of acetate-protecting groups. When
the reaction was complete (typically 15–25 min), it was quenched
by the addition of solid NaHCO3. After 15 min, water and
dichloromethane were added to form an aqueous–organic partition.
The aqueous was extracted exhaustively with dichloromethane, and then
the combined organic phases were dried with sodium sulphate and concentrated
to dryness. This afforded 18 as a pale yellow oil in
95% yield, which was used immediately in the next transformation.

4.9 (2S,3R,4S,4aR)-6-Oxo-2,3,4,4a,5,6-hexahydro-1H-[1,3]dioxolo[4,5-g]pyrido[1,2-a]quinazoline-2,3,4-triyl Triacetate (19)
2-Iodoxybenzoic acid (54 mg, 0.20 mmol, 1.2 equiv) was dissolved
in reagent grade DMSO (500 μL) and heated to 60 °C for
30 min. A solution of compound 18 (72 mg, 0.16 mmol,
1.0 equiv) in DMSO (200 μL) was then added. This reaction mixture
was stirred for 15 min at 60 °C and then purified directly by
silica gel chromatography (100:0 Et2O/EtOAc → 90:10
Et2O/EtOAc) to afford 19 and 20 as a 3:4 mixture of diastereomers in 45% yield. 19 was
