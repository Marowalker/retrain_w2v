A multicomponent reaction between isatin, tetrahydroisoquinoline,
and terminal alkyne in the presence of benzoic acid for the synthesis
of N-(substituted-2-(2-phenyl-5,6-dihydropyrrolo[2,1-a]isoquinolin-3-yl)phenyl)-3,4-dihydroisoquinoline-2(1H)-carboxamides is described. This three-component reaction
proceeds via sequential formation of spirooxindole, generation of
isocyanate functionality via cleavage of the C2–C3 bond in
the isatin subunit of spirooxindole, and addition of the second molecule
of tetrahydroisoquinoline to the isocyanate group to offer title compounds.
Expansion of the protocol to four-component by including an additional
primary amine affords 1-substituted-3-(2-(2-phenyl-5,6-dihydropyrrolo[2,1-a]isoquinolin-3-yl)phenyl)urea in low to moderate yields.
However, the reaction of intermediate spirooxindole with tetrahydroisoquinoline
or any primary or secondary amine produced the title compound in excellent
yields.

Introduction
Pyrrolo[2,1-a]isoquinoline
and 5,6-dihydropyrrolo[2,1-a]isoquinoline represent
the core structure of lamellarin-type
alkaloids and various bioactive compounds displaying a wide spectrum
of biological activities (Figure 1).1 For instance, Lamellarin
I has multidrug-resistant reversal activity at nontoxic doses, whereas
Lamellarin K is cytotoxic to different cancer cell lines.2 Lamellarin K and L are reported to have immunomodulatory
activity in the micromolar range.3 Furthermore,
Lamellarin D is cited to be a potent inhibitor of DNA topoisomerase
I,4a whereas Lamellarin α-20-sulfate
is a selective inhibitor of HIV-1 integrase.4b

frameworks.

Given the diverse biological properties, synthetic
chemists have
formulated several elegant strategies for constructing differently
substituted pyrrolo[2,1-a]isoquinoline cores.5 Recently, we have reported the dehydrative transformation
of spirooxindoles to pyrido[2,3-b]indoles in the
presence of POCl3.6 The reaction
could be performed as a one-pot two-step process. However, our attempts
to prepare the spirooxindole 4 by reacting isatin (1a) with 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline-3-carboxylic acid
(2) and phenyl acetylene (3a) as reported
were unsuccessful.7 After a short screening
for identifying conditions to access 4, we were successful
in synthesizing it under microwave irradiation albeit in only 5% yield
(Scheme 1). It was
reported the reaction between isatin (1a), 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline
(THIQ) (5a), and alkenes in the presence of trifluoroacetic
acid (TFA) in toluene or montmorillonite K10 leads to the formation
of spirooxindoles.8 Notably, however, the
fate of this multicomponent reaction (MCR) using terminal alkynes
instead of alkenes remains unknown, though it could be reasoned that
such a reaction should also afford a spirooxindole (6). As a consequence, we considered investigating the MCR between
isatin, THIQ, and terminal alkyne in the presence of an acid catalyst.
Accordingly, the reaction between 1a, 3a, and 5a in the presence of TFA in toluene as the medium
at 50 °C was attempted. We found that the reaction was incomplete
even after 12 h, but post-workup at this stage, the major isolated
product (34%) was established as N-(2-(2-phenyl-5,6-dihydropyrrolo[2,1-a]isoquinolin-3-yl)phenyl)-3,4-dihydroisoquinoline-2(1H)-carboxamide 7aaa instead of the spirooxindole 6 (Scheme 2). This result suggested consumption of 2.0 equiv of 5a, and therefore we repeated the reaction with 2.0 equiv of THIQ,
and it was pleasing to discover that the reaction was completed in
22 h to afford 7aaa in 72% yield. Earlier, Stoltz et
al. reported a base-mediated skeletal rearrangement (C2–C3
bond cleavage) of substituted oxindole to offer a urea derivative
via intermediacy of isocyanate.9 However,
the propensity of the protocol to afford 5,6-dihydropyrrolo[2,1-a]isoquinolines incorporating the urea moiety directly via
an acid-catalyzed MCR between isatin, THIQ, and terminal alkyne together
with lack of too many reports10 on C2–C3
bond cleavage of oxindoles evoked us to investigate the reaction comprehensively.

Scheme 2 Comparison of This Work with the Reported Work
Herein, we report the details of the results
of our study and the
scope of this MCR.

Results and Discussion
At the outset of the study,
we considered optimizing the reaction
condition for the formation of product 7, and the results
are summarized in Table 1. As stated above, performing the reaction of 1a and 3a with 2.0 equiv of 5a in TFA as the medium
at 50 °C resulted in the formation of 7aaa in 72%
yield (entry 1). Increasing the temperature of the reaction to 80
°C produced 7aaa in 81% isolated yield within 18
h (entry 2). Next, to investigate the effect of different acid catalysts,
the reaction was carried out in the presence of AcOH, benzoic acid,
or p-TSA, and it was found that benzoic acid gave 7aaa in a superior yield (84%) (entries 3–5). We discovered
that this reaction was successful even in the absence of acid to furnish 7aaa in 71% yield in 26 h (entry 6). Probe for identifying
a suitable solvent for the reaction revealed that it was successful
in MeCN, dioxane, 1,2-dichloroethane (DCE), and water but, the best
yield of 7aaa was obtained in toluene (entries 7–10).
Optimization with respect to reaction temperature identified 90 °C
to be the most suited for the formation of 7aaa (86%)
(entry 11). Therefore, the optimized conditions for the synthesis
of 5,6-dihydro-pyrrolo[2,1-a]isoquinoline 7aaa were identified as heating isatin 1a (1.0 equiv), THIQ 5a (2.0 equiv), and terminal alkyne 3a (1.0 equiv)
in the presence of 20 mol % benzoic acid in toluene at 90 °C
for 16 h.

With optimized reaction conditions in hand, the scope
of the protocol
was investigated initially with respect to a variety of isatins and
alkynes (Scheme 3).
In the first set of experiments, treating differently substituted
isatins (1b–i) with THIQ (5a) and phenyl acetylene (3a) under standard conditions
furnished the corresponding 5,6-dihydropyrrolo[2,1-a]isoquinolines 7baa–7iaa in excellent
yields. The electronic character of the substituents on isatin did
not influence the formation of products. The X-ray crystallographic
analysis of one of the products 7eaa unambiguously secured
the structure as 5,6- dihydropyrrolo[2,1-a]isoquinolines.
Subsequently, testing the scope of the reaction with several terminal
alkynes 3b–3g revealed that all substrates
smoothly afforded the respective products 7aab–7aag in 78–85% yields. Altering the phenyl ring with
heteroaromatic rings in terminal alkynes was also found to be compatible
with the protocol as the alkyne 3h bearing pyridine and 3i containing thiophene furnished 7aah and 7aai in 78 and 80% yields, respectively. Finally, the fate
of the MCR using terminal alkynes bearing aliphatic groups was evaluated.
The terminal alkyne 3j bearing the cyclohexene ring gave
the corresponding product 7aaj in 74% yield, whereas
aliphatic alkynes such as cyclopropylacetylene (3k) and
trimethylsilylacetylene (3l) furnished 7aak and 7aal in moderate yields only. Next, the scope of
the reaction was investigated with 6,7-dimethoxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline 5b, which furnished 7aba in 82% yield, whereas
4,5,6,7-tetrahydrothieno[3,2-c]pyridine 5c afforded the corresponding product 7aca in 84% yield.
Replacing isoquinoline with other secondary amine N-methylbenzylamine 5d however failed to offer the desired
product 7ada. The activated alkyne like methyl propiolate
(3m) and the internal alkyne dimethyl acetylenedicarboxylate
(3n) were however discovered to offer the corresponding
Michael adducts 8am and 8an only (Scheme 4). Finally, performing
the reaction between 1a, 3a, and 5a at a gram scale afforded 7aaa in 85% isolated yield,
thereby indicating that the reaction can be conducted at higher scales
without attenuation of the yield.

Scheme 3 Scope of the Reaction,
Reaction conditions: 1 (2.04 mmol), 5 (4.08 mmol), 3 (2.04
mmol), and toluene (15 mL).

For 1b–1f, R1 is at
C-5; for 1h, R1 is at C-6; and for 1i, R1 is at C-7 of isatin.

Scheme 4 Reaction
with Activated Alkynes
Reaction conditions: 1a (2.04 mmol), 5a (4.08 mmol), 3 (2.04 mmol), and toluene (15 mL).

To expand
the substrate scope of the present protocol, we examined
a four-component reaction (4CR) by treating isatin 1a (1.0 equiv) with THIQ 5a (1.0 equiv), phenyl acetylene 3a (1.0 equiv), and aniline 9a (1.0 equiv) under
standard conditions (Scheme 5). This reaction resulted in the formation of 1-phenyl-3-(2-(2-phenyl-5,6-dihydropyrrolo[2,1-a]isoquinolin-3-yl)phenyl)urea 10aaaa (27%)
together with 7aaa (45%). The success of this 4CR to
give new products invoked us to investigate a variety of amines in
the protocol. The reaction with substituted anilines like 4-methylaniline
(9b), 4-chloroaniline (9c), and 3-bromoaniline
(9d) produced the desired 4CR products 10aaab–aaad in 25–37% yields together with 7aaa. However, reactions with 3-nitroaniline (9e), 4-aminobenzoic acid (9f), or N-Boc-1,4-phenylenediamine
(9g) failed to afford the desired products, though the
3CR product 7aaa (27–65%) was isolated from each
reaction. The heterocyclic amine such as 8-aminoquinoline (9h) resulted in the formation of 10aaah in 35% yield only
along with 7aaa in 57% yield. The reactions of 5-aminoindole
(9i), 2-aminopyridine (9j), and 2-amino-5-chlorobenzothiazole
(9k) also did not afford the respective 4CR products,
but 7aaa was isolated in 56–61% yields. Further,
the scope of the reaction was investigated with aliphatic amines such
as benzylamine 9l, N-methylcyclohexylamine 9m, and N-methylbenzylamine 5d, and it was discovered that these reactions resulted in a complex
mixture from which the required product could not be isolated. Pleasingly,
however, aliphatic amines having a bulky group like 1-adamantylamine
(9n) or tert-butylamine (9o) furnished the desired urea 10aaan or 10aaao in 21–43% yields together with 7aaa.

Scheme 5 Scope of
the Four-Component Reaction
Reaction conditions: 1 (2.04 mmol), 5a (2.04 mmol), 3 (2.04 mmol), 9 (2.04 mmol), and toluene (15 mL). Yields
are calculated based on the amount of 5a.

Based on the literature, we anticipated the formation
of an isocyanate
intermediate, but to delineate the stepwise mechanism of our reaction,
we performed a few control experiments. To ascertain the essentiality
of N-unprotected isatin for this reaction, we carried
out the reaction with N-protected isatin 1j under standard conditions, which resulted in a complex mixture of
products (Scheme 6).
In our attempt to isolate the isocyanate intermediate, the reaction
between 1a, 3a, and 5a was
monitored carefully. The thin layer chromatography (TLC) analysis
of the reaction mixture after 4 h showed the presence of two new spots
beside the starting material. Arresting the reaction followed by workup
resulted in isolation of 7aaa in 28% yield together with
another solid product (49%) that was spectroscopically established
to be the spirooxindole 6a. Additionally, arresting the
reaction between 1f, 3a, and 5a after 4 h gave spirooxindole 6b in 35% yield together
with 7faa in 24% yield. However, all efforts to obtain
spirooxindole 6 exclusively from the reactions between
isatin 1, 3a, and 5a were unsuccessful.
Isolation of 6 suggested that the reaction proceeds via
the intermediacy of spirooxindole, which then undergoes C2–C3
bond cleavage followed by the attack of the second THIQ unit. To ascertain
it unambiguously, we heated the spirooxindole 6a with 5a in toluene, which produced 7aaa in 94% yield
(Scheme 7). Further
treating spirooxindole 6a with 9a furnished 10aaaa in 81% yield. Although we could not isolate the isocyanate,
it was discovered that the reaction of spirooxindole 6a with Cs2CO3 in dimethylformamide (DMF) gave
the aniline 11 in 93% yield as reported earlier9 (Scheme 7).

Scheme 6 Results of Control Experiments
Scheme 7 Reactions of Spirooxindole 6 with THIQ,
Cs2CO3, and Different Amines
These control reactions inferred that the reaction
of spirooxindole 6a with any primary or secondary amine
should offer the corresponding
urea derivative 10. Accordingly, 6a was
treated with different amines 9a, 9l, 9p, or 9q, and gratifyingly in each case, the
corresponding urea 10aaaa, 10aaal, 10aaap, or 10aaaq was isolated in excellent yields
(Scheme 7). Based on
these studies, the plausible mechanism for the formation of urea derivatives
is delineated in Scheme 8. The initial imine formation between the isatin 1 and
THIQ 5 leads to azomethine ylide A, which,
via [3+2] cycloaddition of the alkyne 3, produces spirooxindole 6. However, under basic conditions, 6 undergoes
C2–C3 bond cleavage to offer the isocyanate B,
which suffers the nucleophilic attack by the amine to afford the title
compound 7. The extended conjugation of the pyrrole and
the benzene ring as observed in 7 is anticipated to be
one of the influencing factors for the skeletal rearrangement in spirooxindole 6. To gain support for this reasoning, we performed the reactions
of Cs2CO3 with spirooxindoles 4 and 12,6 which were unsuccessful
(Scheme 9).

Scheme 8 Plausible
Mechanism for the Formation of 7
Scheme 9 Reaction of 4 and 12 with
Cs2CO3
Finally, to explore the synthetic transformations
of 7aaa, we performed a few robust synthetic transformations.
Oxidative
thiocyanation of 7aaa with ammonium thiocyanate (NH4SCN) in the presence of ceric ammonium nitrate (CAN) in methanol
furnished 13 in 89% yield (Scheme 10).11 The halogenation
reaction of 7aaa using N-bromosuccinimide
(NBS)5i resulted in the formation of 14 in 87% yield. Basic hydrolysis of the urea moiety of 7aaa afforded aniline 11 in 58% yield. Next,
we treated 7aaa with Lawesson’s reagent in toluene
as the medium under microwave heating for 2 h, which gave aniline 11 in 94% yield, instead of the expected thiourea derivative 15. Nonetheless, treating 11 with 3-chlorophenyl
isothiocyanate in methanol afforded the thiourea derivative 15a in 55% yield. To investigate whether the spirooxindole 6 would undergo the POCl3-mediated dehydrative
transformation as reported by us earlier,6 we heated 6a and 6b with POCl3 at 90 °C for 24 and 48 h, respectively, to obtain fused-pyrido[2,3-b]indoles 16a and 16b in 74–84%
yield.

Conclusions
In conclusion, we have developed a multicomponent
route for the
synthesis of 5,6-dihydropyrrolo[2,1-a]isoquinolines
incorporating the urea moiety using isatins, THIQ, and terminal alkynes
as the starting substrates. A variety of isatins and terminal alkynes
are compatible in the reaction to offer the corresponding N-(substituted-2-(2-phenyl-5,6-dihydropyrrolo[2,1-a]isoquinolin-3-yl)phenyl)-3,4-dihydroisoquinoline-2(1H)-carboxamides in moderate to excellent yields. The four-component
reactions between isatin, THIQ, primary amines, and terminal alkynes
were found to be successful to afford 1-substituted-3-(2-(2-phenyl-5,6-dihydropyrrolo[2,1-a]isoquinolin-3-yl)phenyl)ureas (from primary amines) in
moderate yields together with carboxamides (from THIQ). However, we
demonstrate that this limitation of the 4CR can be circumvented by
performing the reaction of the spirooxindole intermediate with primary
or secondary amines to prepare the 1-substituted-3-(2-(2-phenyl-5,6-dihydropyrrolo[2,1-a]isoquinolin-3-yl)phenyl)ureas in excellent yields. This
protocol allows generation of molecular complexity from the readily
available starting materials in a single step under transition metal-free
conditions. We have also demonstrated the utility of the obtained
products for further diversification for medicinal chemistry programs.
Studies concerning newer applications of the present protocol and
biological assessment of the synthesized 5,6-dihydropyrrolo[2,1-a]isoquinolines are underway in the laboratory.

General Experimental Procedure for the Four-Component Reaction
for the Synthesis of 1-Substituted-3-(2-(2-Phenyl-5,6-dihydropyrrolo[2,1-a]isoquinolin-3-yl)phenyl)ureas 10 As Exemplified
for 10aaaa
To a stirred solution of isatin 1a (2.04 mmol, 0.3 g) in toluene (15 mL) were added THIQ 5a (4.08 mmol, 0.272 g), phenyl acetylene 3a (2.04
mmol, 224 μL), aniline 9a (2.04 mmol, 186 μL),
and benzoic acid (20 mol %, 0.049 g), and the reaction mixture was
heated at 90 °C under stirring for 20 h. On completion as evident
from TLC analysis, the solvent was evaporated to obtain a residue
that, upon column chromatography over silica gel using hexanes/EtOAc
(80:20 v/v to 70:30 v/v) as eluent, gave 0.255 g (27%) of 10aaaa as a white solid together with 0.463 g (45%) of 7aaa.

Experimental Procedure for the Synthesis of 1-Substituted-3-(2-(2-Phenyl-5,6-dihydropyrrolo[2,1-a]isoquinolin-3-yl)phenyl)ureas 10 from 6a As Exemplified for 10aaal
To a stirred
solution of spirooxindole 6a (0.275 mmol, 0.1 g) in toluene
(5 mL) was added amine 9l (0.275 mmol, 20 μL),
and the reaction mixture was heated at 90 °C for 14 h. On completion,
the solvent was evaporated to obtain a residue that was directly purified
by column chromatography over silica gel using hexanes/EtOAc (80:20,
v/v) as eluent to obtain 0.11 g (86%) of 10aaal as a
white solid.
