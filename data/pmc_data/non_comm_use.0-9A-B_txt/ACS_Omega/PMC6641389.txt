A mono-potassium
cation-encapsulated Preyssler-type phosphotungstate,
[P5W30O110K]14– (1), was prepared as a potassium salt, K14[P5W30O110K] (1a),
by heating mono-bismuth- or mono-calcium-encapsulated Preyssler-type
phosphotungstates (K12[P5W30O110Bi(H2O)] or K13[P5W30O110Ca(H2O)]) in acetate buffer. Characterization
of the potassium salt 1a by single-crystal X-ray structure
analysis, 31P and 183W nuclear magnetic resonance
(NMR) spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, high-resolution
electrospray ionization mass spectroscopy, and elemental analysis
revealed that one potassium cation is encapsulated in the central
cavity of the Preyssler-type phosphotungstate molecule with a formal D5h symmetry. Density functional
theory calculations have confirmed that the potassium cation prefers
the central position of the cavity over a side position, in which
no water molecules are coordinated to the encapsulated potassium cation. 31P NMR and cyclic voltammetry analyses revealed the rapid
protonation–deprotonation of the oxygens in the cavity compared
to that of other Preyssler-type compounds. Heating of 1a in the solid state afforded a di-K+-encapsulated compound,
K13[P5W30O110K2] (2a), indicating that a potassium counter-cation is
introduced in one of the side cavities, concomitantly displacing the
internal potassium ion from the center to a second side cavity, thus
providing a new method to encapsulate an additional cation in Preyssler
compounds.

==== Body
Introduction
Tungsten forms anionic
mixed metal oxides with other cationic elements
to afford heteropolytungstates. Such compounds display acidic, multielectron
redox, and photochemical properties and have thus attracted increasing
interest as catalysts and functional materials.1−3 Preyssler-type
phosphotungstates, [P5W30O110Mn+(H2O)](15–n)– (M: encapsulated cation), contain five PO4 tetrahedra surrounded by 30 WO6 octahedra (10 cap tungsten
and 20 belt tungsten) forming a doughnut-shaped molecule (Figure 1), and have been
employed as acid catalysts4 and functional
materials.5−7 Preyssler compounds can encapsulate different cations
(M) such as Na+,8,9 Ag+,5,10,11 K+,12,13 lanthanoid cations,9,14−18 Ca2+,9,18,19 Bi3+,9,18,20 Y3+,9,18,19 and actinoid metals,9,14,15,19,21 and their
properties such as the redox potentials, magnetic properties, and
thermal stability can be tuned by exchanging the encapsulated cations.9,15,16,18,22−28 Such Preyssler compounds present two types of cavities: (1) one
central cavity surrounded by 10 oxygens (Oa) bound to P
atoms and (2) two side cavities surrounded by 5 oxygens (Oa) bound to P atoms and 5 bridging oxygens (Ob) between
two cap tungsten atoms (Figure 1).

indicate tungsten, phosphorus, oxygen, oxygen surrounding the central
cavity, mono-encapsulated cation, water molecule oxygen coordinated

In almost all of the Preyssler-type phosphotungstates, the
encapsulated
cation occupies one of the two side cavities, presenting a coordination
with five Oa oxygens, five Ob oxygens, and one
coordinating water molecule (Figure 1c). One exception is the di-K+-encapsulated
Preyssler-type phosphotungstate [P5W30O110K2]13– (2), which
we reported in a previous paper.29 In this
compound, two potassium cations are located in the side cavities (Figure 1d). Wang’s
group reported a K+ located in the central cavity of a
Preyssler-type sulfotungstate, [S5W30O110K]9–, where K+ was coordinated by 10
Oa oxygens (Figure 1e).30

In this paper, we report
a new Preyssler-type phosphotungstate
with one encapsulated potassium cation in the central cavity, [P5W30O110K]14– (1) (Figure 1e), and the migration of a potassium counter-cation into the molecule
in the solid state to form a di-K+ species (2).

Results and Discussion
Preparation and Isolation of K14[P5W30O110K] (1a)
K13[P5W30O110Ca(H2O)] was
dissolved in a potassium acetate buffer (pH 4.7) in the presence of
KCl and heated at 170 °C for 24 h (Table 1, entry 4). Once the reaction mixture had
cooled down to room temperature, a colorless solid was obtained. The 31P NMR spectrum of the solid shows three singlets at −8.96,
−10.15, and −10.96 ppm (Figure 2b); the peaks at −8.96 and −10.96
ppm were assigned to the starting material, [P5W30O110Ca(H2O)]13–, and the
di-K+-encapsulated derivative, [P5W30O110K2]13– (2), respectively. The peak at −10.15 ppm is not assignable
to any known species. The 31P NMR spectrum of the filtrate
shows two singlets at 0.75 and −11.47 ppm (Figure 2c), where the singlet at 0.75
ppm may correspond to phosphate species and the singlet at −11.47
ppm is not assignable. Repeated recrystallization of the solid from
hot water afforded colorless crystals showing only the 31P NMR singlet at −10.15 ppm (Figure 2e,f).

(pH 4.7) in the presence of KCl (6 mmol, Table 1, entry 4), and the solid obtained after
the (d) first, (e) second, and (f) third recrystallization. The [P5W30O110Ca(H2O)]13– spectra display one singlet or two singlets depending on the pH
of the solution. The black, blue, and red arrows indicate the signals
for [P5W30O110Ca(H2O)]13–, [P5W30O110K2]13–, and the new species, respectively.
The solid (ca. 50 mg) was dissolved in ca. 1.0 mL of D2O.

Single-Crystal Structure Analysis of K14[P5W30O110K]
The
single-crystal structure
analysis revealed that the isolated colorless crystals belong to a
Preyssler-type phosphotungstate with one encapsulated potassium cation
(K+) (Figure 1e). The potassium cation is located in the central cavity on a pseudo-fivefold
rotation axis of the molecule coordinated by 10 P–Oa oxygens with bond distances of 2.934–2.962 Å. No water
molecules coordinating the central K+ ion were found.

A few reports on mono-K+-encapsulated Preyssler-type compounds
have been published. Sun’s group reported Preyssler-type phosphotungstates,
where one K+ was placed in one of the side cavities with
a coordinated water molecule. On the other hand, Wang’s group
reported a Preyssler-type sulfotungstate, where a K+ ion
was placed in the central cavity. K14[P5W30O110K] (1a) is the first example
in which a K+ ion is placed in the central cavity of a
Preyssler-type phosphotungstate. Similar to the potassium salt of
the di-K+-encapsulated Preyssler compound, K13[P5W30O110K2] (2a),291a crystallizes
in an orthorhombic space group (Figure 1g), where counter-cations and solvent molecules are
located between the molecules.

A summary of the parameters of
the [P5W30O110K]14– (1) unit in 1a is presented in Table 2, together with those
of the [P5W30O110K2]13– (2) unit in 2a. The molecular
size is quite similar, although
the diameter of the circle going through the five Oa atoms
in 1 is slightly larger than that in 2.

IR, Elemental Analysis, High-Resolution Electrospray
Ionization
Mass Spectroscopy (HR-ESI-MS), and 183W NMR Analysis of
K14[P5W30O110K] (1a)
The IR spectrum of 1a shows the
characteristic bands of a Preyssler-type phosphotungstate at 1173,
1088, 1012, 985, 930, 906, and 794 cm–1 (Figure 3b), similar to those
of mono-Na+(H2O)-encapsulated Preyssler-type
phosphotungstates (Figure 3a) and 2a (Figure 3d), but with some bands slightly shifted (Table 2). We have previously
reported that the IR bands of 2 are sharper than those
of mono-Na+(H2O)-encapsulated compounds because
the higher symmetry of the di-K+ compound (D5h) gives fewer peaks with more degenerate
normal modes of vibration than those of the Na+(H2O) compound (C5v).29 The IR bands of 1a are also sharper
than those of Na+(H2O) compounds, confirming
that 1a bears one central K+ ion with D5h symmetry.

(1b), (d) K13[P5W30O110K] (1a) heated at
300 °C, and (e) K13[P5W30O110K2] (2a).

The elemental analysis revealed that the formula of 1a is K14[P5W30O110K]·26H2O. The HR-ESI-MS spectrum of 1a dissolved in
a CH3CN/H2O mixture showed the characteristic
peaks for H8[P5W30O110K]6–, H9[P5W30O110K]5–, H10[P5W30O110K]6–, and their dehydrated
species (Figure S1), indicating also the
presence of [P5W30O110K]14– species in the solution.

Figure 4 shows the 183W NMR spectra of 1a, 2a, and K14[P5W30O110Na(H2O)] dissolved in D2O. The spectrum of the mono-Na(H2O)-encapsulated Preyssler-type
phosphotungstate shows four
singlets with a 2:2:1:1 integration ratio (Figure 4c) owing to its C5v symmetry, where the belt and cap tungsten atoms
close to the encapsulated Na+ are not equivalent to those
far from the encapsulated cation (Figure 1d). The 183W NMR spectrum of [P5W30O110K]14– (1) displays two singlets at −208.2 and −302.1
ppm with a 2:1 integration ratio (Figure 4a), similar to the 183W NMR spectrum
of [P5W30O110K2]13– (2) (Figure 4b) but with different chemical shifts (Table 2). The presence of two singlets in a 2:1
integration ratio indicates that both the cap and belt tungsten atoms
are equivalent, suggesting that the isolated Preyssler-type phosphotungstate
with one central K+ is stable in the aqueous solution.

Figure 4 183W NMR spectra of (a) K14[P5W30O110K] (1a), (b) K13[P5W30O110K2] (2a), and (c)
K14[P5W30O110Na]. Each
sample (ca. 0.5 g for 1a and 1.0
g for K13[P5W30O110K2] and K14[P5W30O110Na]) was dissolved in ca. 2.5 mL of D2O using a Li-resin.

Density Functional Theory
(DFT) Calculations
The structure
of 1a differs from that of other Preyssler-type phosphotungstates,
in which one cation is encapsulated in the side cavity coordinated
by one water molecule. To confidently assign the obtained structure,
we calculated the relative stability of all of the possible structures
(Table 3). The calculations
revealed that the mono-K+-encapsulated Preyssler structure
with a K+ ion sitting in the central cavity in the absence
of water coordination is 35.74 kcal mol–1 more stable
than that with the cation sitting in one of the side cavities with
a coordinated water molecule (entry 1). The mono-K+-encapsulated
Preyssler structure with the K+ ion in a side cavity without
a coordinated water molecule is 20.17 kcal mol–1 more stable than that presenting a solvent coordination (entry 2).
These results suggest that the coordination of a water molecule is
not the preferred situation when K+ is present inside the
Preyssler cluster. Furthermore, the mono-K+-encapsulated
Preyssler without coordinated water is 15.6 kcal mol–1 more stable when K+ is in the central cavity than when
it is located in a side cavity (entry 3). These results suggest that
a structure with one central K+ with no water coordination
is theoretically reasonable.

a The H2O molecule is outside
the Preyssler molecule.

b The H2O molecule is inside
the Preyssler molecule and coordinated to the encapsulated K+.

c (K+)aq has
been computed as a large water cluster surrounding a K+ ion.

In contrast, Sun’s
group has reported mono-K+-encapsulated Preyssler-type
compounds where one K+ ion
is sitting in one of the side cavities and one water molecule is coordinated
to the K+ in Preyssler-metal–organic hybrid coordination
polymers.12,13 Thus, the structure with one K+ cation in the side cavity may be stabilized in such a hybrid system.

Preparation and Characterization of the Acid Form H14[P5W30O110K] (1b)
Similar to other Preyssler compounds, the acid form of 1a, H14[P5W30O110K] (1b), can be prepared by the reaction of 1a with
an acidic resin (eq 1). The elemental analysis confirmed that all of the counter-cations
were exchanged with protons except the encapsulated K+,
which was not exchanged, affording the formula H14[P5W30O110K]·40H2O. The
IR spectrum of 1b is similar to that of 1a in terms of the band position and sharpness (Figure 3c). These results thus confirmed the successful
preparation of the acid form H14[P5W30O110K] (1b) with one central K+. 1   2  The 31P NMR spectrum of 1b in D2O shows one broad singlet, unusual for
Preyssler-type
compounds (Figure 5b), which is converted into the sharp peak of 1a upon
neutralization of 1b with 14 equiv of KHCO3 in D2O (eq 2). It has been reported that the 31P NMR spectra of Preyssler
phosphotungstates, [P5W30O110Mn+(H2O)](15–n)– (M = Ca2+, Bi3+,
Eu3+, Y3+), show one sharp singlet or two sharp
singlets depending on the pH of the solution. Pope’s group
has reported that the protonation of the inner oxygen of mono-cation-encapsulated
Preyssler-type phosphotungstates occurs to form mono-cation-and-proton-encapsulated
species (eq 3),19 describing the pKa value for a mono-Eu3+(H2O)-encapsulated compound
to be below 3. We have reported the pKa value for a mono-Ca2+(H2O)-encapsulated compound
to be ca. 6,18 and López and Poblet’s
group has reported pKa values of less
than 2 for a mono-Na+(H2O)-encapsulated compound.23 The inner oxygens (Oa) not coordinating
the encapsulated cations have been suggested to be prone to undergo
such a protonation (eq 3).19,23 The protonation–deprotonation rate
is significantly slower than the NMR timescale, and thus sharp 31P NMR singlets of protonated and deprotonated species are
observed. Such a slow proton-exchange rate is explained by the coordination
of two oxygens (one Oa not coordinating the encapsulated
cation and the O of the water molecule coordinated to the encapsulated
cation) to the incorporated proton. In previous paper, we reported
that the potassium salt (2a) (Figure 5h) and acid form of the di-K+ compound
show only one sharp singlet at the same chemical shift because no
protonation occurs in the cavity.29 3  The 31P NMR spectrum of the potassium
salt 1a became broader in an acidic solution (Figure 5c–f), indicating
that the changes in the broadness of the signal are reversible. On
the other hand, the 31P NMR signal of 2a in
the acid solution was sharp (Figure 5g). We believe that the broad signal of 1b in D2O arises from the protonation–deprotonation
processes of the inner oxygen, which are so fast that only one a peak
is observed and whose protonation occurs at pH values lower than 2.
The absence of a water molecule coordinated to the K+ ion
in 1 may be the reason why the protonation–deprotonation
processes are faster than in the other Preyssler compounds.

(ca. 50 mg) was dissolved in ca. 1.0 mL of solution.

Protonation of the inner oxygen has also been demonstrated
by cyclic
voltammetry (CV). It is known that the redox potentials are shifted
by changing the encapsulated cation charge,9 and the first reduction potential shifts to more positive values
with the increasing charge of the incorporated cation.

The Na+(H2O)-encapsulated Preyssler-type
phosphotungstate has been reported to exhibit two large redox couples
and one small redox couple in 1.0 M HCl, corresponding to four-, four-,
and two-electron redox processes of the tungsten atoms, respectively
(Figure 6 (pink)).9,25 The larger two, four-electron redox couples are split into two,
two-electron redox couples upon exchanging Na+ with higher-valence
cations, such as Ca2+, Y3+, or Th4+, and the first two-electron reduction potential (the most positive
redox couple) is shifted to a more positive potential by increasing
the cationic valence of the encapsulated cation (the first redox potentials
are −0.16, −0.14, and −0.12 V vs Ag/AgCl for
the Na+(H2O)-, Ca2+(H2O)-, and Bi3+(H2O)-encapsulated compounds,
respectively).

M HCl. The arrow indicates the direction of the potential scan. (a)

The inner oxygen of a mono-cation-encapsulated
Preyssler compounds
is protonated in 1.0 M HCl,23 and we consider
that the observed redox potentials correspond to the protonated species,
in which case the first reduction potential of di-K+-encapsulated 2a is similar to that of the Na+(H2O)-H+-encapsulated compound.29

The cyclic voltammogram of 1a in 1.0 M HCl shows three
large redox couples (Figure 6a (black)). The first reduction peak current starts to increase
at a more positive potential than that of 2a, being similar
to the species from the Ca2+(H2O)-H+-encapsulated structure (Figure 6b), suggesting that two-proton protonation occurs in
the 1.0 M HCl solution.

Reaction Conditions
To find optimal
synthesis condition
for mono-K+-encapsulated species (1) and di-K+-encapsulated species (2) under hydrothermal
conditions, we varied the reaction conditions and the obtained species
were analyzed by 31P NMR spectroscopy (Table 1).

When Ca2+(H2O)-encapsulated compound K13[P5W30O110Ca(H2O)] was heated in KOAc
buffer solution at 170 °C for 24 h, 1 and 2 were obtained in 11 and 16% yield, respectively, and the
starting Ca(H2O) compound was recovered in 52% yield (entry
1). When KCl was added to the reaction solution, the conversion of
the Ca(H2O) compound increased, as did the yield of 2 (entries 3, 4, 6, and 7). The conversion of the Ca(H2O) compound increased with the reaction time, the yield of 1 decreased, and that of 2 increased (entries
2 and 5). When the reaction was performed in LiOAc buffer solution,
only 2 was obtained in 4% yield and the starting Ca(H2O) compound was recovered in 33% yield. In the LiOAc buffer,
only a small amount of potassium (counter-cation of the starting compound)
is present and able to replace the Ca2+ ions. These results
indicate that the starting Ca(H2O) compound is consumed
in the buffer solution and the yield of both 1 and 2 increases with the increasing amount of potassium cations
in the solution.

When a Bi3+(H2O)-encapsulated
compound, K12[P5W30O110Bi(H2O)], was heated in the LiOAc buffer solution, 1 and 2 were obtained in 4 and 28% yield, respectively,
and almost
all of the starting Bi(H2O) compound was consumed (entry
9). The addition of KCl to the reaction mixture increased only the
yield of 2, whereas 1 was not detected (entries
10–12). A reaction temperature of 170 °C is required to
consume the Bi(H2O) compound (entry 13) and the reaction
needs to be performed in the buffer solution (entries 14 and 15).

The same reaction with a Na+(H2O)-encapsulated
compound, K14[P5W30O110Na(H2O)], did not produce any new solids, and the Na-encapsulated
compound was fully recovered (entry 16).

Thermal Conversion of Mono-K-Encapsulated
Compound 1 into Di-K-Encapsulated Compound 2 in Solid State
The thermal stability of the Preyssler compounds
is one of the
most interesting topics for us. We have reported that the potassium
salt of di-K+-encapsulated Preyssler compound 2a is thermally stable up to 450 °C.29 We observed that heating of 1a produced di-K+-encapsulated species 2a (Figures 3d and S2), indicating
that one potassium counter-cation migrates into one of the side cavities
and the K+ in the central cavity moves into the other side
cavity (Figure 7).
Thermogravimetric-differential thermal analysis (TG-DTA) measurements
of 1a revealed an exothermal peak at a temperature between
250 and 320 °C (Figure S3), which
may be assigned to the conversion of 1a into 2a.

Figure 7 Schematic representation of the conversion of K14[P5W30O110K] (1a) into K13[P5W30O110K2]
(2a).

Exchange of the encapsulated
cations has thus been achieved under
hydrothermal conditions, and this solid-state heating process offers
an additional method to introduce and/or exchange the encapsulated
cation in the Preyssler compounds.

Taking the mono-K+ compound with K+ in the
center of the cavity (1a) as a reference, compound 2a with two K+ ions in the side cavities was found
to be much more stable (66 kcal mol–1, Table 3, entry 4). Although
this process is largely exothermic, the conversion of 1a into 2a needs a temperature of ca. 300 °C. Intuitively,
a large activation barrier must be overcome to reach the most stable
product, [P5W30O110K2]13–. The calculations show that a relatively large (thermal)
energy (ca. 36–43 kcal mol–1) is necessary
for the cation to pass through the cavity entrance and reach the final
position in the di-K structure (Figure S4).

Catalytic Activity as an Acid Catalyst
The acid form 1b exhibits catalytic activity similar to that of other acid
forms of mono-cation-encapsulated compounds toward the hydration of
ethyl acetate (Table 4), and the catalytic activity per weight was found to be similar
to that of the mono-Na(H2O)-encapsulated compound4 and better than that of the well-known Keggin-type
phosphotungstic acid H3PW12O40.

Conclusions
The
first Preyssler-type phosphotungstate with one encapsulated
potassium cation in the central cavity, [P5W30O110K]14–, was prepared as a potassium
salt and characterized by empirical and theoretical methods. Heating
of the potassium salt led to the migration of one potassium counter-cation
into one of the side cavities, displacing the already encapsulated
potassium cation to the other side cavity to form a di-K+-encapsulated derivative. This process represents a new method to
introduce cations into the Preyssler compounds.

Experimental Section
Materials
Deionized water (Millipore, Elix) was used
in all of the experiments. Compounds K14[P5W30O110Na(H2O)]·23H2O,
K13[P5W30O110Ca(H2O)]·25H2O, and K12[P5W30O110Bi(H2O)]·24H2O were prepared according to published procedures18 and analyzed by 31P NMR and infrared (IR) spectroscopy.
All of the other chemicals were reagent grade and used as supplied.

Preparation
of K14[P5W30O110K]·17H2O (1a)
K13[P5W30O110Ca(H2O)]·25H2O
(2.39 g, W: 9 mmol) and KCl (0.45 g, 6
mmol) were mixed in the potassium acetate buffer (2 M KOAc and 2 M
AcOH mixed in a 1:1 ratio, 5 mL, pH 4.7) in a 30 mL Teflon-liner autoclave
and the mixture was stirred for 5 min at room temperature. The autoclave
was placed in an oven heated at 170 °C for 24 h. Once the reactor
had cooled down to room temperature, the resulting colorless crystals
were separated from the solution by filtration. The crystals were
recrystallized from 25 mL of hot water heated at 90 °C (using
a metal bath), and a final third recrystallization afforded a pure
product suitable for single-crystal X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis.
The colorless crystals were collected by filtration and dried at 70
°C overnight (0.04 g, 0.005 mmol, yield of 2% based on W). Elemental
anal. calcd (found) for K14[P5W30O110K]·17H2O (%): P, 1.86 (1.85); W, 66.3
(66.4); K, 7.05 (7.11); H, 0.48 (0.46).

Preparation of H14[P5W30O110K]·40H2O (1b)
K14[P5W30O110K]·17H2O (0.20 g) was dissolved in
H2O (8 mL) and passed
through 2.5 g of Dowex 50 WX8 in a protonic form packed in a glass
tube (inner diameter: 20 mm) with additional water until the eluent
was neutral. The eluent was then evaporated using a rotary evaporator
in vacuo at 60 °C. A minimum amount of water was added, and the
resulting solution was poured into a glass beaker and dried at 70
°C overnight (0.18 g, 0.13 mmol, yield of 93% based on W). Elemental
anal. calcd (found) for H14[P5W30O110K]·40H2O (%): P, 1.89 (1.88); W, 67.2
(67.2); K, 0.485 (0.51); H, 1.06 (1.161).

X-ray Crystallography
Single-crystal X-ray diffraction
(XRD) data for the 1a crystals were collected on a Bruker
SMART APEX II ULTRA diffractometer at 173 K using a monochromated
Mo Kα radiation (λ = 0.71073 Å). The structure was
solved via direct methods using a SHELXS-97 and refined via the full-matrix
least-squares method on F2 with SHELXL-97.31 The atoms of the polyoxometalate molecules and
counter-cations were refined anisotropically, and the oxygen atoms
of crystalline water molecules were located in a difference Fourier
map and refined with isotropic thermal parameters. The hydrogen atoms
of crystalline water were not located. The number of potassium atoms
and water oxygen atoms determined by XRD was lesser than that determined
by elemental analysis due to disorder in the structure. The crystallographic
data are summarized in Table 5. Further details of the crystal structure analysis can be
obtained from Fachinformationszentrum Karlsruhe, 76344 Eggenstein-Leopoldshafen,

Other Analytical Techniques
The
IR spectra were recorded
on a NICOLET 6700 Fourier transform infrared spectrometer
(Thermo Fisher Scientific) as KBr pellets. The cyclic voltammetry
(CV) was performed on a CHI620D system (BAS Inc.) at ambient temperature.
A glassy carbon working electrode (diameter, 3 mm), a platinum wire
counter electrode, and an Ag/AgCl reference electrode (203 mV vs the
normal hydrogen electrode at 25 °C) (3 M NaCl, BAS Inc.) were
used. The approximate formal potential values (E1/2 values) were calculated from the CVs as the average of
the cathodic and anodic peak potentials for the corresponding oxidation
and reduction waves. The 31P NMR spectra were recorded
on a Varian 500 (500 MHz) spectrometer (Agilent, P resonance frequency:
202.333 MHz). The spectra were referenced to external 85% H3PO4 (0 ppm). The 183W NMR spectra were recorded
on a Varian 500 (500 MHz) spectrometer (Agilent) (W resonance frequency:
20.825 MHz). The spectra were referenced to an external saturated
Na2WO4 (0 ppm). The 1a sample for 183W NMR spectroscopy was treated with lithium resin to increase
its solubility in D2O. Elemental analyses were carried
out by Mikroanalytisches Labor Pascher (Remagen, Germany). High-resolution
ESI-MS spectra were recorded on an LTQ Orbitrap XL instrument (Thermo
Fisher Scientific) with an accuracy of 3 ppm. Each sample (5 mg) was
dissolved in 5 mL of H2O, and the solutions were diluted
with CH3CN (final concentration: ca. 10 μg mL–1).

Hydrolysis of Ethyl Acetate
Hydrolysis
of ethyl acetate
was carried out at 80 °C with 5 wt % ethyl acetate in D2O (total volume: 3.0 mL, ethyl acetate: 0.15 g) for 2 h.4 The amount of protons used was maintained at
0.042 mmol.

Electronic Structure Calculations
Density functional
theory (DFT) calculations were performed for the [P5W30O110K]14–, [P5W30O110K(H2O)]14–, and
[P5W30O110K2]13– structures with the ADF 2016 suite of programs.32,33 Intermediate geometries were also analyzed to estimate the K+ encapsulation energy profile. Equilibrium geometries were
obtained upon full geometry optimization with tight convergence criteria
(optimized structures must be very accurate when frequency calculations
are to be conducted because molecular vibrations can be highly dependent
on the geometrical parameters) and the OPBE functional34,35 with triple-ζ + double polarization atomic basis sets, using
the frozen core approximation for the following shells: 1s–3p
for K, 1s–2p for P, 1s–4f for W, and 1s for O. We simulated
an aqueous solution (dielectric constant, ε = 78.39) by including
the solvent and counterion effects by means of the conductor-like
screening model.36−39
