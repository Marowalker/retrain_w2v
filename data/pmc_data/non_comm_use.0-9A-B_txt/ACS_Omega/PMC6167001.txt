Four HIV-1 protease
(PR) inhibitors, clinical inhibitors lopinavir and tipranavir, and
two investigational compounds 4 and 5, were
studied for their effect on the structure and activity of PR with
drug-resistant mutation L76V (PRL76V). Compound 5 exhibited the best Ki value of 1.9 nM
for PRL76V, whereas the other three inhibitors had Ki values of 4.5–7.6 nM, 2–3 orders
of magnitude worse than for wild-type enzymes. Crystal structures
showed only minor differences in interactions of inhibitors with PRL76V compared to wild-type complexes. The shorter side chain
of Val76 in the mutant lost hydrophobic interactions with Lys45 and
Ile47 in the flap, and with Asp30 and Thr74 in the protein core, consistent
with decreased stability. Inhibitors forming additional polar interactions
with the flaps or dimer interface of PRL76V were unable
to compensate for the decrease in internal hydrophobic contacts. These
structures provide insights for inhibitor design.

==== Body
Introduction
The protease (PR) encoded
by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is an important drug target
for treatment of the pandemic disease HIV/AIDS. A decrease in AIDS-associated
deaths was observed in the mid-90s because of the inclusion of both
PR inhibitors (PIs) with reverse transcriptase inhibitors in therapy.1 Despite this notable success, the rapid evolution
of drug-resistant viral strains poses a critical challenge, and drug-resistant
mutations have been observed for all classes of antiviral drugs.2 HIV PR performs an essential role in viral replication
by processing the viral precursor polyproteins into mature viral proteins.
Inhibitors bind in the active-site cavity of dimeric HIV PR and block
its catalytic activity. More than 100 mutations in the PR gene have
been associated with drug resistance.3

Second-generation inhibitors, such as darunavir (1),
lopinavir (2), and tipranavir (3) (Figure 1), were designed
to target resistant variants of HIV-1 PR. The peptidomimetic inhibitor 2 resembles the natural PR substrate with P2–P3′
groups.4,5 Inhibitor 3 is a highly potent,
nonpeptidic PI with a unique oxygen that displaces conserved active-site
water and forms direct hydrogen bonds with the main chain amides of
Ile50/Ile50′.6,7 The most-recently approved inhibitor, 1, exhibits low toxicity and is equipped with P2/P2′
groups that form strong hydrogen bonds with conserved, main chain
atoms, resulting in high binding affinity for PR.8−10 Because of
these favorable factors, resistance mutations rarely develop during
treatment with 1.11

Figure 1 Structures
of HIV-1 PIs 1–6.

The evolution of resistance toward second-generation
inhibitors has fueled the design of novel investigational inhibitors.
Compounds GRL-0519 (4) and GRL-5010 (5),
derived from the scaffold of 1, are highly potent against
several drug-resistant variants (Figure 1). Inhibitor 4 has an enlarged
tristetrahydrofuran P2 group, which fits better in the S2 pocket of
PR and reinforces a water-mediated network at the dimer interface.12−14 Inhibitor 5 differs from 1 by addition
of a gem-difluoro moiety on the P2 bis-THF group,
which improves lipophilicity and forms halogen bond interactions with
the carbonyl oxygen of flap residue Gly48.15−17

Mutation
L76V is associated with clinical resistance to 1, fosamprenavir, 2, and indinavir;2,18 however, it is also
linked with increased susceptibility to first-generation inhibitor
saquinavir (6), atazanavir, and 3.19,20 This mutation occurs with a frequency of around 3% in PI-experienced
patients20,21 and can be transmitted to treatment-naive
patients.22,23 Inclusion of L76V in mutants bearing three
other resistance mutations is associated with two- and eightfold increase
in resistance to 1 and 2, respectively,
and an eightfold increase in susceptibility to 6.20

Previous studies of PR with the single
mutation of L76V (PRL76V) showed about 100-fold worse inhibition
by 1 compared to wild-type PR (PRWT) as assessed
by isothermal titration calorimetry,24 although
another group using an enzyme inhibition assay reported only 1.5-fold
loss in potency.25 Investigational inhibitor
GRL-02031 showed a twofold increase in inhibition constant (Ki) for PRL76V in comparison to PRWT.26 Crystal structures of PRL76V in complexes with 1 and 6 showed
loss of interactions with 1 and gain of a water-mediated
interaction with 6 relative to PRWT,24,25 consistent with the effects on resistance.20 These effects on inhibitors must be indirect as the side chain of
Leu76 lies in the interior of the PR dimer and has no van der Waals
contacts with these antiviral inhibitors. In the mutant structure,
the smaller Val76 side chain has lost hydrophobic interactions with
neighboring side chains of Asp30, Lys45, Ile47, and Thr74 compared
with those of the wild-type Leu76, consistent with decreased stability
and slower autoprocessing observed for the mutant and its precursor.24,26

Here, we have assessed the effect of four antiviral inhibitors,
clinical inhibitors 2 and 3 and investigational
inhibitors 4 and 5, on the structure and
activity of the PRL76V mutant. Clinical inhibitor 2 was selected because L76V is associated with an eightfold
increase in resistance to this PI as inferred from genotype–phenotype
data.20 Fluorine-containing inhibitors, 3 and 5, form direct interactions with flap residues
of the PR,7,16 potentially stabilizing the PR dimer. The
larger P2 group and reinforced dimer interface interactions of compound 4 also might overcome the decreased dimer stability observed
for PRL76V.12,24 The results show that these chemically
diverse inhibitors lose potency against PRL76V, and suggest
that local rearrangements in the hydrophobic core because of mutation
L76V act to decrease the effectiveness of the inhibitors.

Results
Tested Inhibitors
Have Higher Ki Values for PRL76V Relative to PRWT
Inhibition constants (Ki) of the compounds for PRL76V were
determined using a fluorescent substrate analog of the HIV-1 p2/NC
cleavage site. Table 1 lists Ki values for the mutant in comparison
with values reported previously for wild-type enzymes.7,12,16 As reported previously, inhibitor 1 has the best inhibition of this mutant,24 whereas inhibitor 6 retains a similar inhibition
of mutant relative to wild-type enzymes.27,28 Compound 5 is the most potent of the new inhibitors
for PRL76V with a Ki of 1.9
± 0.7 nM, whereas 3 and 4 are the worst
of the tested inhibitors with Ki of 7.6
± 0.3 and 7.2 ± 1.4 nM, respectively. Therefore, the tested
inhibitors are within a 10-fold difference in potency from each other
for PRL76V inhibition. With the exception of 6, all Ki values measured for inhibition
of PRL76V were significantly higher than the picomolar Ki values reported for wild-type PR with changes
of 1200-fold for 4, 400-fold for 3, 300-fold
for 5, 150-fold for 2, and 80-fold for 1.7,12,16 These higher Ki values imply that L76V confers resistance
toward the four tested inhibitors.

Structures
of the PRL76V Dimer with Inhibitor Resemble Each Other
as Well as Their PRWT Counterparts
Crystal structures
of PRWT complexed with PIs 2 and 3, and of PRL76V complexed with each of the four inhibitors,
were determined at high resolution to identify any structural changes
because of the single mutation (Table 2). The dimer of PRL76V with 2 and the location of residue 76 are illustrated in Figure 2A. All PRL76V structures
were solved in the P21212 space
group with one dimer in the asymmetric unit, as were PRWT complexes with inhibitors 2 and 3 in the
present study and in previous studies [PRWT complexes with 4 and 5 at 1.27 Å (PDB ID 3OK9) and 1.30 Å
(PDB ID 4U8W), respectively].12,16

The unit cell dimensions
were almost identical for all structures, although 2 complexes
had ∼1 Å longer a axis and ∼1
Å shorter b axis compared to the other structures.
The six structures were refined to R-factors of 15.1–19.8%
with diffraction data at a 1.20–1.75 Å resolution. Atoms
were unambiguously modeled, as shown by the electron density map in Figure 2B for the single
conformation of 2 in complex with PRL76V.
Coordinate errors estimated from Luzzati plots ranged from 0.14 to
0.18 Å for the highest to lowest resolution structures.

The new PRWT complexes with 2 and 3 were refined at near-atomic resolutions of 1.26 and 1.20 Å,
respectively, which is a significant improvement compared to previously
reported structures determined at 1.54 and 1.80 Å resolutions,
respectively.7 The previous PRWT structures in complex with 2 (PDB ID 2O4S) or 3 (PDB ID 2O4P) were solved in the same space group, and the Cα atoms superimposed
with the new higher resolution structures with root-mean-square deviation
(rmsd) values of 0.19 Å for complexes with 3 and
0.20 Å for complexes with 2. Therefore, the overall
folds are very similar.

The four new PRL76V inhibitor
structures were superimposed with their corresponding PRWT inhibitor complexes. The overall backbone structures were essentially
identical, with low rmsd values ranging from 0.12 to 0.17 Å for
all Cα atoms. Therefore, mutation L76V does not produce major
alterations in the overall structure of the PR dimer. Furthermore,
all PRL76V structures were also very similar to each other,
regardless of the inhibitor, with pairwise rmsd values ranging from
0.25 to 0.42 Å.

Polar Interactions are Conserved between
Active-Site Residues and Inhibitors
Hydrogen bonds between
PR and inhibitor, both direct and water-mediated, were compared for
wild-type and mutant PR complexes. Halogen bonds were also observed
for two inhibitors, 3 and 5, containing
fluorine atoms. The interactions are described for the major conformations
of inhibitors in the complexes. Similar interactions were observed
for the minor conformations except where noted.

Hydrogen bond
interactions in X-ray crystal structures of proteins must be interpreted
with caution as hydrogen atoms are poorly scattered by X-rays. Neutron
crystallography, however, provides direct evidence for the position
of protons. The neutron crystal structure of HIV PR with amprenavir
showed nonideal hydrogen bond geometry for inhibitor interactions
with the carbonyl oxygen of Gly27, the amide of Asp29, and a water-mediated
interaction with the amide of Ile50′.29 Similar effects were observed for the neutron structure of amprenavir
complexed with PR mutant V32I/I47V/V82I.30 No neutron crystal structures have been reported for the inhibitor
complexes in this study; hence, hydrogen bonds for L76V complexes
are described by the same criteria as for previously published wild-type
complexes (Figure 3).

Figure 3 Polar interactions of PRL76V with inhibitors. (A) Inhibitor 2 (green); (B) inhibitor 3 (yellow); (C) inhibitor 4 (cyan); and (D) inhibitor 5 (salmon). PR residues
are shown in gray sticks with alpha-carbons as spheres; nitrogen (blue),
oxygen (red), fluorine (pale cyan), water (red spheres). Side chains
without polar interactions with inhibitors are omitted. Hydrogen bond
interactions conserved in wild-type and mutant PR are shown as black
dashed lines. Interactions that do not form in the mutant are shown
as red dashed lines. Halogen bonds are in green dotted lines. Interatomic
distances are given in Å for PRL76V (black) and PRWT (red in parenthesis) if values differ by 0.3 Å or more.
In (D), Asp30 and Asp30′ are shown in two alternate conformations,
and the interactions of Asp30′ with P2′ group of inhibitors
differ for the alternate conformations. Distances for the (B) conformation
of Asp30′ are shown after a forward slash.

All clinical inhibitors contain a central hydroxyl group
that interacts with the catalytic aspartates, residues 25 and 25′,
of PR. The protonation state and hydrogen bond interactions of the
catalytic residues, Asp25 and 25′, have been examined in several
neutron structures. The side chain carboxylate oxygens of Asp25 and
25′ are almost coplanar with about 2.7 Å between the closest
“inner” oxygens of the two side chains. Our neutron
structure of wild-type HIV PR with amprenavir showed two protons located
on the inner carboxylate oxygen of Asp25 and the outer carboxylate
oxygen of Asp25′, which formed hydrogen bonds with the inhibitor
hydroxyl.29 Subsequent neutron studies
of 1 and amprenavir complexes with a mutant PR demonstrated
that the location of the two protons varies, depending on the pH,
inhibitor, and mutated residues.30,31 In our X-ray
structures of inhibitor-bound PRL76V, we cannot distinguish
which hydrogen bond interactions occur with the inhibitor hydroxyl
group. In the absence of neutron structures corresponding to the PR
complexes with the inhibitors described here, we have indicated distances
for four possible interactions between the hydroxyl oxygen of the
inhibitor and carboxylate oxygens of Asp25 and 25′ in Figure 3. These interactions
are excluded from the description of inhibitor–PR hydrogen
bonds in the following sections.

Although inhibitor 2 occurs in two alternative conformations with relative occupancy
of 75:25 in the wild-type complex, only a single conformation was
observed for 2 bound to PRL76V. Excluding
interactions with the catalytic Asp25 and 25′, compound 2 shows only three direct hydrogen bonds with PRL76V and three water-mediated interactions with main chain atoms (Figure 3A). The interactions
are in agreement with those reported previously.7 Compound 2 has a pseudosymmetric structure
for the central P1–P1′ region. The water-mediated interactions
with the amides of Ile50 and 50′ in the flaps are conserved
in the majority of PR–inhibitor complexes. The pyrimidine acetamide
group of 2 forms hydrogen bonds with the main chain amide
and carboxylate side chain of Asp29 and a water-mediated interaction
with the carbonyl oxygen of Gly27. These hydrogen bonds contribute
to a network of interactions at the dimer interface connecting Gly27
and Asp29 in one subunit with Arg8′ in the second subunit.
The hydrophobic dimethylphenoxy group on the opposite end of 2 has van der Waals interactions with the side chains of Ala28′,
Asp29′, Asp30′, Val32′, Ile47′ and Ile84′.
Inhibitor 2 shows highly conserved hydrogen bond interactions
in the complexes with PRWT and PRL76V with differences
in hydrogen bond length of no more than 0.2 Å. Therefore, the
decreased potency of 2 toward PRL76V cannot
be explained by changes in PR interactions with the inhibitor.

The distinctive features of the interactions of compound 3 with PR are the presence of direct hydrogen bonds of the inhibitor
with the amides of flap residues Ile50 and Ile50′, as well
as fluoride halogen bonds with the guanidinium side chain group of
Arg8′. None of the other clinical inhibitors can form these
interactions. Furthermore, 3 adopts a bent conformation
at the sulfonamide group, and does not bind in the same pockets as
more peptidic inhibitors. As shown in Figure 3B, inhibitor 3 has five direct
hydrogen bonds with the PR, two halogen interactions with the guanidinium
side chain of Arg8′, and a water-mediated interaction with
the amide of Gly48. The carboxylate groups of the catalytic Asp25
and Asp25′ are rotated in the 3 complex relative
to their orientation in the complexes with other inhibitors and show
altered distances to the hydroxyl of 3. Inhibitor 3 retains wild-type hydrogen-bonding interactions with the
PRL76V mutant, with 0.1 Å difference in distance observed
for most interactions. The largest increases of 0.2 and 0.3 Å
in the mutant are seen for the hydrogen bond to the carbonyl oxygen
of Gly48 and the water-mediated interaction with the amide of Gly48,
respectively. Thus, 3 forms direct hydrogen bonds with
the main chain atoms of flap residues, Gly48, Ile50, and Ile50′
in both wild-type and mutant PRs. Inhibitor 3 shows two
alternative conformations in both complexes with 70:30 relative occupancy;
the minor conformation with 30% occupancy loses a hydrogen bond to
the amide of Asp29 in the mutant structure. The conservation of 3 interactions with PRL76V and wild-type enzyme
implies that the poor Ki value for the
mutant does not arise from altered binding interactions.

In
both the PRWT and mutant complexes, compound 4 binds in two alternative conformations with 50:50 relative occupancy.
Inhibitor 4 forms five direct hydrogen bonds with PR
and three water-mediated interactions in both mutant and wild-type
complexes (Figure 3C). In comparison to the wild-type complex, both conformations of 4 in the mutant show a slight shift of the water interacting
with the amides of Ile50 and Ile50′, yet this change maintains
the interactions with the flaps. A second water, which is highly conserved
in many PR structures and was mentioned earlier in the description
for complexes with 2, is integrated into a dimer-stabilizing
network of interactions that coordinates the tris-THF rings of 4, the carbonyl oxygen of Gly27, and the side chains of Asp29
and Arg8′. Compared to the wild-type complex, most hydrogen
bond interactions between inhibitors and PRL76V have insignificant
changes of less than 0.1 Å. Greater variation is observed for
the interactions with the flap water with differences of up to 0.4
Å in length. One alternate conformation in both wild-type and
mutant structures shows longer 3.4–3.5 Å hydrogen bonds
between the tris-THF group of 4 and the amides of Asp29
and Asp30. Once again, the lack of significant differences in PR active-site
interactions with 4 indicates that the resistance mechanism
induced by L76V relies on an alternate strategy.

Compound 5 crystallized in two alternate conformations in PRWT as well as in PRL76V with 55:45 relative occupancy. Overall,
PRWT shows seven direct hydrogen bond interactions, two
halogen bond interactions, and three water-mediated interactions with
the major conformation of 5 (Figure 3D). The majority of the direct hydrogen bond
interactions of PRL76V with inhibitors are identical in
length or within a 0.1 Å range from those observed in the wild-type
complex. Asp30 and Asp30′ occur in two alternate conformations,
resulting in differences in the interactions of the P2 aniline group
of inhibitors with Asp30′ in the PRL76V structure.
In the wild-type complex, the amino group of P2 forms hydrogen bond
interactions with the side chain carboxylate of Asp30′ and
with the main chain amide and carbonyl oxygen. In the PRL76V structure, the P2 aniline has shifted slightly relative to its position
in the wild-type complex. In the major conformation of Asp30′
in the mutant, the carboxylate side chain is positioned to form a
shorter hydrogen bond interaction with the aniline amino group relative
to the wild-type complex, whereas the hydrogen bond of the main chain
amide of Asp30′ with the inhibitor NH2 is elongated
to 3.5 Å, and the interaction of the main chain carbonyl oxygen
with inhibitor is lost (interatomic distance of 4.4 Å). Similar
shifts in P2 aniline and altered interactions with Asp30′ were
reported for the PRL76V complex with 1.24 This major conformation of Asp30′ is
stabilized by an ionic interaction with the side chain of Lys45′.
The minor conformation of the Asp30′ side chain has rotated
away from the inhibitor; however, the main chain amide and carbonyl
oxygen form hydrogen bonds of 3.0 and 3.3 Å, respectively, with
NH2 of inhibitors. Although 5 is the most
effective of the four tested inhibitors for PRL76V, it
did not retain the picomolar inhibition reported for wild-type enzymes.
Overall, the interactions of the major conformation of 5 with Asp30′ are altered in the mutant; however, the rest
of the hydrogen-bonding network is maintained. Therefore, the loss
in potency against the mutant is not completely explained by interactions
between inhibitors and PR.

Polar and hydrophobic interactions
of inhibitors 1–6 with mutant PRL76V and wild-type enzyme are summarized in Table 3. Hydrogen bond interactions
include direct inhibitor–protein interactions and water-mediated
interactions and showed little change for alternate conformations
of inhibitors. The count of van der Waals contacts is complicated
by the existence of alternate conformations of inhibitors, and frequently
for adjacent amino acid side chains or main chains. The exact contacts
may be impossible to determine when alternate conformations show 50:50
relative occupancy and, in fact, multiple conformations will contribute
to the ensemble present in solution. The binding affinities of clinical
inhibitors for wild-type PR have been divided into enthalpic and entropic
components using isothermal scanning calorimetry.7,28 The
binding of inhibitors 2, 3, and 6 is dominated by the large entropic component, and only inhibitor 1 showed enthalpically driven binding to wild-type PR. This
thermodynamic analysis implies that in most cases inhibition cannot
easily be assessed by summing inhibitor–PR interactions. In
fact, thermodynamic dissection of inhibitor affinity for mutant PRs
showed unfavorable changes in both entropic and enthalpic components.7 Inhibitor 1 loses hydrogen bond
interactions with mutant PRL76V, countered by a small increase
in hydrophobic contacts, and worse inhibition of the mutant. Inhibitor 6 showed gains in hydrogen bond and hydrophobic interactions
with this mutant in agreement with insignificant differences in inhibition
compared to wild-type enzymes. Apart from inhibitor 2, the other inhibitors showed fewer hydrophobic contacts with mutants
as well as worse inhibition values.

Hydrophobic
Interactions of Leu76 are Decreased in the PRL76V Mutant
Residue 76 occupies a region critical for internal hydrophobic
contacts between the flap and the core of the protein. Residue 76
lies in the central strand of a three-stranded β-sheet forming
one flank of the substrate binding cavity near the base of the flap
(Figure 2). The mobility
of the flaps is essential for substrate binding and catalysis as the
flaps act as lids over the active-site cavity and must open to allow
substrate entry and release of products.32 Consequently, altered flap dynamics has been reported for drug-resistant
mutants.25,27,33,34

In all the structures of PRWT and
PRL76V with various inhibitors, the main chain of residue
76 forms conserved hydrogen bond interactions with adjacent strands
of the β-sheet comprising residues 31–33 and 57–59.
In addition, the side chain of residue 76 forms hydrophobic interactions
with the side chains of Val32, Val56, and Gln58 (Figure 4). Furthermore, the wild-type
residue, Leu76, forms van der Waals interactions with Asp30, Thr74,
and with the side chains of Lys45 and Ile47 in the first β-strand
of the two-stranded flap (Figure 4A). These interactions of Leu76 with residues 30–33
and both strands of the flap are conserved in the open conformation
of the PR dimer (PDB ID 2PC0).35 However, in the PRL76V mutant, the shorter side chain of Val76 loses hydrophobic
contacts with the first β-strand of the flaps, and additionally
loses interactions with Asp30 and Thr74 (Figure 4B). These changes agree with those reported
previously for PRL76V complexes with 1 and 6.24

Figure 4 Hydrophobic interactions
of residue 76. Hydrophobic interactions are shown for inhibitor 3 complexes with (A) PRWT and (B) PRL76V. The main chain of PR is shown as gray ribbons. The side chains
are represented by sticks with Cα atoms as spheres. The tip
of the flap in the second subunit of the dimer is shown as black cartoons.
Leu76 is green, Val76 is red, and side chains of residues that lose
interactions in the mutant are shown in purple in (B). The number
of van der Waals contacts of the side chain of residue 76 with neighboring
residues is indicated next to each dotted line.

The flap–core interface is composed of residues Lys45,
Ile47, Ile54, Val56, and Gln58 in the flap, residues Asp30 and Val32
in the inhibitor binding site, and Thr74 and Leu76 in the protein
core. The side chains of these residues form hydrophobic interactions
and shield the interface from the solvent. Leu76 is a central component
of the flap–core interface and provides extensive hydrophobic
interactions connecting the flaps to the active site. The loss of
interactions across the flap–core interface in the PRL76V mutant is expected to influence flap mobility and promote inhibitor
dissociation from the dimer. This effect is consistent with the observations
of increased dimer dissociation and decreased dimer stability.24 Increased conformational flexibility of the
flaps in the PRL76V mutant compared to the wild-type enzyme
was reported in 1 ns molecular dynamics simulations of the complexes
with inhibitor 2 consistent with increased calculated
interaction free energy and clinical resistance.36

Discussion
Drug-resistant mutation
L76V is rare in clinical isolates of HIV; however, this mutation alone
acts to decrease the stability of the PR dimer, alters precursor processing,
and reduces viral fitness.20,24,37 In this study, we examined the effect of four antiviral inhibitors,
two clinical drugs and two investigational inhibitors, on the single
mutant PRL76V. These inhibitors exhibit different chemical
structures and binding interactions with the PR.

The tested
inhibitors have Ki values of ∼2–8
nM for PRL76V, which are 2–3 orders of magnitude
worse compared to values reported for the wild-type enzyme.7,12,16 None of these inhibitors were
more effective than 1 for the mutant PRL76V. Inhibition of PRL76V by 1 has been reported
as 0.79 nM24 or 1.5-fold worse25 than for wild-type enzymes in different assays
with two distinct substrates. GRL-02031, a different antiviral inhibitor
based on the 1 scaffold, also gave an inhibition constant
of 0.8 nM for PRL76V, consistent with decreased interactions
of the P1′ pyrrolidinone group with PR atoms.26 In contrast to other tested inhibitors, 6 exhibited
similar inhibition of the PRL76V mutant compared to wild-type
enzymes, consistent with retaining antiviral effectiveness.19,20,24 In the current study, 5 was the better of the two investigational inhibitors with Ki of 1.9 nM for PRL76V, possibly
due to the two halide interactions with the carbonyl oxygen of Gly48
in the flap. Compounds 3 and 4 showed the
worst inhibition, which suggests neither the larger tris-THF group
at P2 in 4 nor the direct interactions of 3 with the flaps are beneficial for binding to this mutant.

The structures of PRL76V–inhibitor complexes are
very similar to the corresponding wild-type enzyme structures. Only
inhibitor 5, which was the best inhibitor of the four
for PRL76V, showed distinct changes in the interactions
of the aniline amine with alternate conformations of Asp30′.
Elongations of water-mediated bonds by up to 0.3 and 0.4 Å, respectively,
were observed in complexes 3 and 4. The
active-site interactions with 2 were essentially identical
in both the wild-type and the mutant. Fewer van der Waals contacts
occurred with the mutant compared to wild-type enzymes for inhibitors 3, 4, and 5, whereas inhibitors 1, 2, and 6 showed the opposite
effect. Therefore, the mechanism of resistance does not seem to rely
solely on the loss of active-site interactions with inhibitors. Mutation
L76V is not unusual in this respect; mutations L90M and N88D/S also
have no direct interactions with inhibitors, yet are strongly associated
with resistance to one or more clinical inhibitors.2,38

The rarity of L76V as a single mutation in clinical samples, at 0.4%,20 may be due to its debilitating effects on precursor
processing. Furthermore, the slower turnover of substrate and poor
inhibition may arise from alterations in the dynamics of flap opening
and closing rather than altered interactions with inhibitors. The
mutation is likely to confer resistance by a mechanism that is independent
of the inhibitor interactions in the active site. Instead, the loss
of interactions of Val76 with residues at the base of the flap could
increase flap mobility. If the virus accumulates additional mutations,
as observed in 3.2% of clinical samples,20 these mutations might compensate for the loss of stability because
of L76V, while retaining resistance to a specific drug.

Interestingly,
five of the seven residues adjacent to Leu76 in the PR structure are
sites of major resistance mutations, D30N, V32I, I47V, Q58E, and T74P2. Of these, only the resistance mutation Q58E is strongly
associated with L76V in resistant mutants.2,39 Experimental
studies corroborate findings from statistical analyses. Mutation L76V,
which is associated with resistance to 1, is selected
during viral passage with increasing concentrations of 1.40 In contrast, L76V is associated with
increased susceptibility to 6 and atazanavir, and experiments
suggest that L76V re-sensitizes multi-drug resistant viruses to therapy
with those two inhibitors.19 Flap mutation
M46I is strongly associated with L76V as shown by a large proportion
of coprevalence in L76V-containing sequences.20,39,41 Impaired autoprocessing of precursor PR-containing
L76V is partly rescued by addition of a second mutation of M46I24 and, although L76V reduces viral replication,
viral fitness is partly rescued by combination with this mutation.37 The effects of combining L76V with other mutations
on the structure and dynamics of the PR dimer have not yet been explored.

An inhibitor capable of forming strong interactions with residues
45–47 of the flaps might assist in retaining a closed conformation
dimer, and be effective against resistant mutants with defects such
as those observed for L76V. Therefore, this hydrophobic region between
the flaps and the outer edge of the active site in each monomer is
a potential target site that should be considered during the design
of next-generation inhibitors for resistant viruses.

Experimental
Section
Enzymes and Inhibitors
PRWT and PRL76V proteins contain optimizing mutations Q7K/L33I/L63I to reduce autoproteolysis
and C67A/C95A to prevent thiol bond formation.42 Recombinant PR was expressed in Escherichia
coli BL21 DE(3) and purified by size-exclusion chromatography
followed by reverse phase chromatography as described previously.43 PR was refolded via buffer-exchange dialysis
in 25 mM formic acid and 1 mM dithiothreitol. PR was activated via
buffer-exchange dialysis in 50 mM sodium acetate, pH 5.0. PR was concentrated
to 3.5–5.0 mg/mL for crystallization or further diluted for
inhibition assays as needed. Inhibitors 2 and 3 with HPLC purity of 99.3 and 100%, respectively, were obtained from
the AIDS Reagent Program, Division of AIDS, NIAID, NIH. Inhibitors 4 and 5 (>95% purity by HPLC) were provided
by Dr. Arun Ghosh at Purdue University.

Enzyme Inhibition Assays
A continuous kinetic assay employing a Foster resonance energy
transfer substrate analog of the HIV-1 p2/NC cleavage site (Abz–Thr–Ile–Nle–p-nitro-Phe–Gln–Arg–NH2 where
Abz is anthranilic acid, Nle is norleucine, and p-nitro-Phe is p-nitrophenylalanine) was performed
as previously described.26 Microtiter plates
(96-well) were loaded with 10 μL PR stock (final well concentration
12–26 nM determined via active-site titration with tight binding
inhibitor), 98 μL reaction buffer (0.1 M 2-morpholinoethanesulfonate
(MES), pH 5.6, 0.4 M NaCl, 1 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, and
5% glycerol), and 2 μL inhibitor in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)
(final well concentration of 0–100 nM). Samples were equilibrated
at 25 °C for 5 min and the reactions were measured at the same
temperature. The reactions were initiated by addition of 90 μL
substrate at a final well concentration of 81 μM. Reactions
were measured under steady-state conditions using a PolarStar Optima
(BMG Labtech) with emission wavelength at 340 nm and excitation wavelength
at 420 nm. Fluorescence resulting from substrate hydrolysis at each
inhibitor concentration [I] was measured and plotted against time.
Initial velocities (V0), corresponding
to the slope per minute of each reaction, were determined using MARS
software (BMG Labtech). A dose–response plot of V0 versus [I] was constructed using SigmaPlot (Systat Software)
by nonlinear regression curve fitting to determine IC50. Reactions were performed in triplicate, and Ki values were calculated from IC50 using the tight-binding
inhibitor equation Ki = (IC50 – 0.5[E])/(1 + [S]/Km).44 The Km for PRL76V at 37 μM was determined previously under similar
conditions.24

Protein Crystallization
Each inhibitor suspended in DMSO was complexed with PR on ice at
a molar ratio of at least 5:1 and crystallized using vapor diffusion
hanging drop method. Each drop contained equal volumes of protein
and reservoir solution. Crystals grew in 0.8–1.5 M sodium chloride
as precipitant. Crystals for most complexes grew in 0.1 M sodium acetate,
pH 4.0–5.4, as buffer. Buffers used for crystallization for
the following were exceptions: 0.1 M MES, pH 5.6, for PRWT in complex with 2, and 0.1 M citrate phosphate, pH
6.0, for PRL76V in complex with 2. Moreover,
5% DMSO was used for crystallization conditions of PRL76V complexes with 2 and 3. Crystals were
soaked in reservoir solution with 30% glycerol (v/v) as cryoprotectant
and then flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen.

X-ray Diffraction, Processing,
and Refinement
X-ray diffraction data were collected remotely
using Southeastern Regional Collaborative Access Team ID-22 and BM-22
beamlines of the Advanced Photon Source in Argonne National Laboratory
(Argonne, IL). Diffraction data were indexed, integrated, and scaled
using HKL-2000.45 Molecular
replacement was performed using CCP4 Phaser(46,47) with PRWT in complex with amprenavir (PDB 3NU3) as the initial
model. Structures were refined iteratively with Coot(48) and SHELX.49 The inhibitor and any side chains with incomplete
2Fo – Fc density were removed during the initial rounds of refinement to
avoid bias, and atoms were added according to density in Fo – Fc omit maps. Alternate
conformations were modeled if visible in the electron density maps
for the inhibitor and protein residues. Anisotropic B factors were
included in the last stages of refinement for all structures, except
for the lowest resolution structure of PRL76V in complex
with 4. Structures were analyzed using Coot, CCP4 Superpose, CCP4 Baverage, CCP4 Contact, and CCP4 Sfcheck. Illustrations were created using PyMol (Schrödinger, LLC.).
