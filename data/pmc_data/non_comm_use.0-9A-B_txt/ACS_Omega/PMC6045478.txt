In this work, we present a novel,
simple, and highly accurate three-dimensional
(3D) diffusion reflection (DR) imaging system and method for the detection
of accumulation sites of gold nanorods (GNRs) within the tissue. GNRs
are intensively used for diagnosis purposes of varied diseases, mainly
because of their ability to well absorb visible light, which introduces
them as terrific contrast agents in various imaging and theranostics
methods. Lately, these GNRs unique absorption properties have served
in DR intensity-based measurements, suggesting a novel diagnostic
tool, DR-GNRs. In this paper, we show a new measurement system and
method for DR, based on its radial collection from the tissue. These
radial measurements enabled a unique 3D presentation of the DR-GNR,
introducing the dimensions ρ for the radius, θ for the
angle, and Γ for the reflected intensity. On the basis of the
diffusion model, which enables to correlate between the sample’s
optical properties and its reflectance, a unique, radial map is presented.
This map introduces the slopes of the DR curves in each measured angle,
which are linearly correlated with the tissue’s optical properties
and with the GNRs concentrations within the tissue, thus enables the
exact radial localization of the GNRs in the sample. We show the detection
of macrophage accumulation in tissue-like phantoms, as well as the
localization of unstable plaques in hyperlipidemic mice, in vivo.
This highly accurate, powerful technology paves the way toward a real-time
detection method that can be successfully integrated in the rapid
increasing field of personalized medicine.

==== Body
Introduction
The development of
technologies for in vivo therapeutic and diagnostic
applications is essential for enhancing the therapeutic chances of
some diseases. Nowadays, the most applied imaging methods in clinical
routines are the X-ray,1,2 computed tomography (CT),3 positron emission tomography (PET),4,5 and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).6,7 These are powerful,
highly successive methods for all body imaging. Still, they present
lack of advantages because of ionizing radiation8 and high power laser intensity (which might cause some
thermal effects to the surrounding tissue) and are usually expensive
and sophisticated to use. Another intensively used imaging method
is the ultrasound (US),9,10 which is safe and easy to use,
yet suffers from limited resolution and penetration depth.11 A real need exists in the development of additional
diagnosis technologies.

Diffusion reflection (DR) spectroscopy
is a simple, safe, and easy-to-apply
diagnostic technique that has the potential to provide important morphological
information regarding biological tissues without requiring high radiation
intensities or high penetration depth.12−15 On the basis of this technique,
a pair of source and detector fibers placed along the tissue surface,
separated by a distance origin from few millimeters to few centimeters,
to enable the DR collection.16 Previous
research studies have suggested that DR measurements can serve for
functional diagnosis and therapeutic monitoring of cancer diseases.17−20 This includes, for example, dynamic near-infrared (NIR) technique,
denoted diffuse correlation spectroscopy21,22 and diffuse wave spectroscopy.23,24 Still, similar
to other NIR spectroscopies, these methods use natural endogenous
tumor-to-normal contrasts available in tissues, such as oxy-deoxy
and total hemoglobin, water, lipids, and blood,25 and therefore suffer from relatively low signal-to-noise
ratio (SNR) because of the high scattering properties of the tissue
in the optics region. Our previous works have suggested an improved
SNR of the diffusion-based spectroscopy by the insertion of biocompatible
contrast agents into the tissue, to increase the optical contrast
between the site of interest and its surrounding.26 Gold nanorods (GNRs) have served as successful candidates
for this purpose, which significantly improved the SNR by the increase
of the absorption properties of the damaged site. The GNRs exhibit
unique absorption properties in the NIR region, where light penetration
through the tissues is relatively high (up to few centimeters). Up
to now, the GNR-based DR measurements have proved to be a successful
tool for the detection of head and neck cancer,27,28 oral cancer,29,30 and atherosclerosis unstable
plaques.31,32

Till far, DR-GNR measurements were
performed in a one-dimensional
scanning form, resulting with a decreasing DR curve as a function
of the radial distance from the light source.27 We showed that on the basis of a simple form of the optical diffusion
equation, we can correlate between the tissue’s optical properties
and the DR curves. In this paper, we present a major achievement of
the DR-GNR detection method, introducing a spatial DR method with
high sensitivity and improved resolution. The radial measurements
enabled the three-dimensional (3D) presentation of the irradiated
tissue, introduced by ρ, the radial distance between the light
source and the detector; θ, the radial angle; and Γ, the
diffused reflected intensity. The 3D presentation enabled the easy
and fast identification of the GNR sites within the tissue. We show
the detection of GNRs accumulation in tissue-like phantoms; moreover,
the precise detection of unstable, macrophage-rich plaques in hyperlipidemic
mice, which served as an atherosclerosis model.

Results and Discussion
Spatial
Diffusion Reflection of Homogeneous Tissue-like Phantoms
Spatial DR measurements of tissue-like phantoms were carried out
using the method described in the Methods section
below. The phantoms were irradiated with 650 nm illumination, according
to the absorption peak of the GNRs (see Methods, Figure 8). Figure 1 introduces the spatial
diffuse reflected intensity from phantoms with and without GNRs (basic
and GNR phantoms, Figure 1a,b, respectively). The spatial intensities present a clear
difference between the reflectance of the basic and GNR phantoms,
whereas the intensities from the basic phantom begin from ∼13
and present a moderate decrease toward 0, and the intensities from
the GNR phantom begin from ∼8 and decrease rapidly toward zero
intensity. The low initial intensity, as well as its rapid decrease,
is due to the absorption of light by the GNRs, providing a clear indication
for the GNRs presence in the measured phantom. 3D figures are attached
in the Supporting Information file, enabling
the simple rotation of the figures.

Figure 1 Spatial diffusion reflection of basic
(a) and GNR (b) phantoms.
The color bar presents the intensity of the reflected diffusion, whereas
the red colors are for higher intensity values and the dark blue colors
are for lower values of intensities. The numbers around the circle
are for the measured angles, whereas the interval between each two
measurements was 30°. The basic phantom presents higher intensities
and a very moderate decrease compare to the GNR phantom, enabling
the easy and fast identification of the GNRs in tissue-like conditions.
At least three repetitive measurements were performed for each sample.

Figure 2 presents
a polar plot of the DR intensities of Figure 1, presented in the logarithmic form ln(ρ2Γ(ρ)). In our previous works, we have introduced
the mathematical correlation which best fit between the optical properties
of the irradiated tissue and its DR profile measured by our optical
setup27 1  

Figure 2 Logarithmic form of the
spatial DR plotted according to eq 1. The radial DR of the
basic (a) and GNR (b) phantoms presented according to eq 1. One can notice that using this
presentation, the GNR phantom is more distinguishable from the basic
phantom, compare to the “classical” DR presentation
in Figure 1. This is
because this presentation is linearly correlated with the sample’s
optical properties, thus the high absorption of the GNR phantom has
high values. (c) Radial distribution of the average μ (resulting
from an average of at least three different measurements) for both
basic (solid outline) and GNR (dashed outline) phantoms. The angles
were measured with intervals of Δθ = 30°, as presented
around the circles. The vertical axis is for the μ values. This
radial presentation enabled clear distinguishing between the basic
and GNR phantoms, as the basic phantom presents low, uniform μ
values compare to the GNR phantom effective attenuation coefficients.
The GNR phantom μ values are not uniformly distributed because
of some inhomogeneous mixing of the GNR in the phantom solution; thus,
some regions in the phantom present higher GNR concentrations than
others.

While μ is the effective
attenuation coefficient, given by 2  when ρ is the distance between the light
source and the detector, Γ is the reflectance intensity, C1 is a constant which depends on the optical
setup apertures, and μ is the effective attenuation coefficient
which depends on μa and μs′, the absorption and the
reduced scattering coefficients of the irradiated sample, respectively.
Presenting the DR in this logarithmic form suggests high correlation
with the samples’ optical properties, as shown in Figure 2. Thus, the resulted
spatial curves of the basic and GNR phantoms are more distinguishably
compared to the regular intensity-based presentation in Figure 1. Furthermore, using this presentation,
the DR slopes of each specific measured angle were calculated according
to eq 1, resulting with
μ, the effective attenuation coefficient, and then were plotted
in a radial map. This radial presentation of μ is highly sensitive
to the optical properties of the tissue, introducing a very simple
way to distinguish between the two irradiated samples. The μ
presentation suggests not only a major difference between the basic
and GNR phantoms but also their radial distribution within the measured
site. Thus, for example, angles 0, 30, and 60 present the highest
effective attenuation coefficient values for the GNR phantom (0.66,
0.55, 0.67, 0.66, compare to ∼0.47 in average for the other
measured angles), suggesting a region with higher GNR concentration
(this is due to some inhomogeneity of the GNRs distribution in the
solidified phantom, caused by an unperfect component mixing process).

Spatial Diffusion Reflection of Mixed Tissue-like Phantoms
Identifying
GNRs Specific Accumulation Sites
The spatial
DR measurements were performed on basic phantoms presenting a GNR
region within it (illustrated in Figure 3a). The purpose of these experiments was
to use the novel DR technique for the identification of the GNR site
within a phantom, mimicking the identification of macrophages, following
their GNR uptake, in the case of an unstable atherosclerotic plaque
and can also serve, later, for tumor margin identification. Accumulation
of GNRs in an atherosclerotic active plaque is expected based on the
known finding that phagocyte cells, including macrophages, can uptake
metal nanoparticles33,34 because macrophages are major
components of the unstable, inflammatory active atherosclerotic plaque.35,36 This experiment was performed with two different mixed phantoms:
first, a phantom presenting a GNR spot in its center and second, a
phantom with solidified macrophages, following their 24 h incubation
with the GNRs.

Figure 3 Spatial DR of a phantom with a GNR accumulation site within
it.
(a) Illustration of the three different measured regions in the phantom;
(i) the basic region, (ii) the GNR spot, and (iii) the mixed area,
containing GNR and basic regions in the same scan. The arrows in the
figure are to show a sample of the different measurements’
radii, indicating that the GNR site was on the left side of the mixed
area (iii). (b) Spatial diffused reflection from the mixed phantom.
The three different regions, i, ii, and iii, are according to the
regions illustrated in (a). It is well-noticed that the DR of the
site (iii) is a composition of figures (i) and (ii), with a specific
indication for the GNR region at 210°–330°, as in
this radial region, the DR intensities intensively decrease, similar
to figure (ii). (c) Radial distribution of the logarithmic DR average
slopes, according to eq 1, for the three different measured regions; the solid outline is
for the region (i), the dashed outline is for the region (ii), and
the dotted outline is for the region (iii). It is well seen that in
angles 210–300, the μ values are very similar to the
μ values in region (ii), indicating the GNRs presence in this
site. Each sample was measured three times, and the presented slopes
are average of at least three different experiments.

GNR Spot within a Basic Phantom
Phantoms with a spot
of GNRs (its preparation procedure is described in the Methods section below) were measured using the spatial DR
method. Figure 3a presents
different regions that were measured in this phantom: (i) a site with
no GNRs, (ii) the GNRs accumulation site, and (iii) a mixed area,
which enabled to measure both basic and GNR sites in the same scan.
A representative spatial reflection is presented in Figure 3b. Whereas the (i) and the
(ii) scans present the expected DR spatial pattern, similar to the
spatial diffusion presented in Figure 1a,b, respectively, the (iii) scan suggests a mixed
DR pattern, composed of the two DR patterns (i) and (ii), as indicated
by the arrows. In region (iii), the steep decreasing pattern is in
the radial region of angles 240–300, suggesting that the GNRs
which are concentrated is in this radial area. The DR slopes polar
presentation in Figure 3c clearly shows the GNR site, as the μ values for 240°,
270°, and 300° are almost identical to the μ values
of the GNR phantoms, whereas for the other measured angles, the effective
attenuation coefficients were lower (∼0.2 compare to an average
slope of 0.5 for the GNR and basic regions, respectively). In the Supporting Information file, the 3D figures can
be found, enabling to rotate the DR profile, for the facile location
of the GNRs accumulation site in the phantom. We found this radial
presentation a very simple way to identify the exact location of the
GNRs accumulation site in a phantom.

Macrophages within a Phantom
Macrophages were incubated
with GNRs (0.2 mg/mL) for 24 h and then were dissociated from the
surface with trypsin and solidified within a phantom. The GNR uptake
by the macrophages was then verified by flow cytometry measurements
(FCM), and results suggested a nice uptake of GNRs after 24 h of incubation
(see Supporting Information Figure S2).
The spatial DR of the phantoms’ different regions, with and
without macrophages, was measured. Representative DR images are shown
in Figure 4. It is
well-noted that the spatial DR pattern of the macrophage accumulation
region is different from the DR of the basic phantom. More particularly,
the DR from the macrophages presents two major regions with different
decreasing patterns: the first is for the angles 60–120, with
high initial intensity (∼9 au) that decreases to zero intensity
very fast. The second region is for the angles 240–300, where
the initial intensity is the lowest, then decreases to zero in intensity
(similar to the pattern in Figure 1b, for the GNR phantom). Figure 4c presents the slopes that were extracted
from the decreasing ln(ρ2Γ(ρ)) curves
(can be found in the Supporting Information, Figure S1), for the same intensities profile presented in Figure 4a. This radial presentation
of the slopes, resulting with μ, clearly shows two different
sites, indicated as i and ii, in which the macrophages where accumulated,
presenting the highest μ values for 60–120 and 240–300
in degrees. These results indicate the GNRs uptake by the macrophages
but more important, the highly sensitive detection of the macrophages
following their GNRs, in tissue-like conditions. It paved the way
for in vivo radial DR measurements of an atherosclerotic vascular
disease in hyperlipidemic mice.

Figure 4 Representative spatial DR of a phantom
with macrophages following
their 24 h incubation with GNRs. The DR of a basic phantom (a) and
a phantom with macrophages (b). The inhomogeneity of the macrophages
phantom is well seen, especially in comparison to the basic phantom.
In addition, the macrophages phantom presented two interesting regions:
(i) 60°–120°, in which the intensity starts from
high values and decreased to very low values and region (ii) the radial
angles of 240–300 in which the initial intensity is very low,
an indication to the macrophages presence in this radial region of
the phantom. (c) Radial distribution of the average μ values
for the basic phantom (solid outline) and the phantom with the macrophages
following their GNR uptake (dashed outline). The phantom containing
the macrophages presented two regions with effective attenuation coefficients
higher than the basic phantom, for the radial region of 60–120
(i) and 240–300 (ii) in angles, emphasizing the different macrophage
sites, as shown in (b). The μ values are average of at least
three repetitive measurements of three different samples.

Spatial Scanning of Hyperlipidemic Mice Carotids
Atherosclerotic
vascular disease in mice was induced by a hyperlipidemic diet, as
described in the Methods section. The mice
carotids were scanned, noninvasively, before and 24 h post the GNR
injection. Figure 5a,b shows a representative spatial DR, for the normal diet mouse’s
carotid (a) and for the hyperlipidemic mouse (b). There is a clear
difference between the two spatial DR patterns, whereas Figure 5a presents higher reflectance
intensities, moderately decreasing toward zero intensity, the hyperlipidemic
mouse presents intensities very low in values decreasing steeply toward
zero. Figure 5c,d presents
the logarithmic form of the reflectance (according to eq 1 above), with high sensitivity to
the tissue’s optical properties thus to the GNRs presence in
the tissue. The hyperlipidemic mouse presents higher μ values
compare to that of the normal diet mouse for almost all measured angles.
In Figure 5e, the polar
distribution of the average DR slopes (of at least three different
measurements) is presented with higher values for the hyperlipidemic
mouse, indicating that a plaque exists in its artery, whereas the
normal diet mouse presented much lower μ values. The highest
μ values appear in the 120, 180, and 240 radial angles, indicating
the radial scanning site in which the atherosclerosis is more developed.
For additional validation of the unstable plaque in the hyperlipidemic
mouse artery, an ex vivo CT scan was further performed.

Figure 5 The spatial
DR intensity map for the healthy (a) and sick (b) mice’s
carotids. The hyperlipidemic mouse presents a radial intensity distribution
similar to the GNR phantom, presented in Figure 1b above, with very low intensity values.
(c,d) Logarithmic presentation of the DR, for the normal diet mouse
(c) and for the hyperlipidemic mouse (d). This presentation is highly
sensitive to the tissue’s optical properties; thus, the right
panel, for the hyperlipidemic mouse, shows high values, resulting
from the increase in the tissue’s absorption because of the
GNRs accumulation. (e) Radial map of the DR slopes for the normal
(solid outline) and hyperlipidemic (dashed outline) mice. The map
presents higher μ for the hyperlipidemic mouse, resulting from
the high absorption of the GNRs in the plaque.

An ex vivo CT scan of a hyperlipidemic mouse carotid is shown
in Figure 6. The figure
shows
the GNRs accumulation in different sites in the artery, 24 h post
the GNRs injection, indicating that the hyperlipidemic diet has induced
atherosclerosis in the mouse.37 The CT
results provide a proof for the DR in vivo results, which has revealed
the GNRs presence in the same artery. Figure S3, in the Supporting Information, illustrates the measurements’
radii over the CT image, suggesting that once the radius of measurement
has “met” the GNRs, the DR slope is different. Moreover,
according to the CT image, the artery width, and as a sequence, the
GNRs accumulation site, was less than 500 μm, suggesting a very
good resolution for the DR measurement.

Figure 6 Ex vivo high-resolution
CT scan of hyperlipidemic mouse’s
carotid. The distortion of the artery indicates the atherosclerosis
formation because of the hyperlipidemic diet. The GNRs were accumulated
in different sites within the artery, most probably because of their
accumulation in macrophages or in other mononuclear cells. The image
resolution was 500 in micrometer, and some GNR sites were even less
in diameter, indicating the radial DR imaging method ability to track
the AS sites in a very high resolution.

In this paper, we aimed to introduce a novel measurement
procedure
based on the DR imaging system and method, with GNRs as contrast agents.
The novel procedure enables a 3D presentation of the DR from the tissue
surface and a polar plot for the very easy identification of GNRs
accumulation sites in tissue conditions. Similar works have been performed
using targeted GNRs as markers in surface-enhanced Raman scattering
imaging of living cells38,39 or for naked eye glucose
detection in human urine.40 However, in
contrast to the targeted GNRs used in these and similar works, the
DR uses bare, untargeted GNRs for the simple detection of AS. By the
extraction of the decreasing intensity slopes, we were able to create
a radial map that enables to locate the GNR accumulation sites in
a very high resolution. This new method was successfully used for
the exact localization of atherosclerosis unstable plaques in a hyperlipidemic
mice model.

Other diagnostic methods resolving spatial DR measurements
were
previously developed based on the extraction and differentiation of
the tissue’s chromophores of healthy and sick tissues.41,42 Thus, for example, O’Sullivan et al.43 have reported the detection of tumor breast using spatially and
temporally modulated light. Similarly, diffuse optical tomography44,45 was developed, to improve the accuracy of the measured optical properties.
Tomography is also critical for the identification of localized heterogeneities
such as tumors in tissue by the reconstruction of the spatial distribution
of optical/physiological properties at each point (or volume element)
in the tissue, from measurements of fluence rate on the tissue surface.46 These methods are successful for these specific
diagnosis purposes, but because they are based on the detection of
endogenous chromophores, it uses more sophisticated tools in order
to best extract the tissue’s optical properties and avoid low
SNR. In our DR-GNR method, we use a very simple measurement procedure,
as well as a simple algorithm, for the tissue diagnosis, as the GNRs
serve as excellent contrast agents in these kinds of measurements.

The 3D DR-GNR method presented in this paper was successfully used
in the detection of AS unstable plaques. Current imaging techniques
are limited to detect early ASVD. Different noninvasive methods have
been developed in order to detect atherosclerotic disease before it
becomes symptomatic. These included imaging techniques such as coronary
CT angiography,47 fluorodeoxyglucose-PET,
and MRI.48,49 While comparing the DR method with other
3D methods used for atherosclerosis detection, our method presents
important advantages, such as fast data acquisition, high sensitivity,
spatial resolution, and low cost (see in the Supporting Information, Table S1). Other techniques, such as angiography
intravascular US, are invasive and widely employed to visualize the
inside, or lumen, of blood vessels, with particular emphasis on the
coronary arteries.50

The current
presented spatial DR-GNR method can also be a part
of the ongoing increasing field of personalized medicine, which is
critical to many aspects of human health. Because this multidisciplinary
field of personalized medicine aims to tailor therapeutics to individual
patients, on the basis of their exact need and predicted response,
the development of novel detection methods which aims to track the
recovery progression of a patient, as a response to a certain treatment,
is essential. In Figure S4, in the Supporting Information section, we show an ongoing research of us, the
recovery of an atherosclerosis unstable plaque using GNRs attached
to high-density lipoprotein (HDL). The conjugation between the GNRs
and HDL enables the simultaneous detection and therapy of these plaques.
Thus, this novel spatial DR-GNR method can serve for the specific
tracking of the medical influence of HDL on the patients’ health
progression.

Thus, this paper introduces a unique, novel measurement
method
that enables the simple localization of GNRs accumulation by a radial
map presentation. This novel method was here utilized for atherosclerosis
detection, but further work should be carried out for its additional
application for cancer and other diseases in which GNRs can be targeted
and accumulated in the desired site. Moreover, by the development
of a scanning tube which will enable the “one-shot”
radial scan of the desired site, the way toward the clinical use of
this imaging method is paved.

Methods
Diffusion Reflection
Measurements
Our noninvasive DR
optical technique (NEGOH-OP Technologies, Israel)51,52 was used for the radial DR measurements. The setup included a laser
diode with a wavelength of 650 nm as an excitation source. Irradiation
was carried out using a 125 μm diameter optic fiber to achieve
a pencil beam illumination. We used a portable photodiode as a photodetector.
The photodiode was kept in close contact with the tissue surface to
prevent ambient light from entering the detection system and to avoid
potential light loss through specimen edges. The distance between
the light source and the photodiode is ρ, and the initial distance
was ∼1 mm. A consecutive reflected light intensity Γ(ρ)
measurement was enabled using a micrometer plate which was attached
to the optical fiber. The micrometer plate was moved automatically
by incremental steps of 250 μm each. As a result, the reflected
light intensity was collected from 20 source–detector distances
with ρ varying between 1 and 6 mm. The reflected intensity profile,
Γ(ρ) (presented as arbitrary units), was collected using
a DAQ (National Instruments, Israel), and the data were processed
using the LabView program. At least three repetitive measurements
were performed for each sample.

The DR measurements were carried
out by a radial scanning of the phantoms’ surface, with intervals
of Δθ = 30° in angle (apart the in vivo experiments,
in which Δθ = 60° due to some technical limitation
regarding the mouse anesthetizing time) between each two measurements.
The measurements were performed in a radial distance starting from
1 up to 6 mm from the light source. Measurements have started from
1 mm in order to avoid ballistic photons and to collect diffusive
photons only, in order to use optical diffusion equation required
for slope extraction. The radial scanning is illustrated in Figure 7.

Figure 7 Illustration of the radial
DR measurement. The light source is
located on a single point on the sample’s surface, and the
detector is moving in two ways: first, from 1 to 6 mm in distance
from the light source and then, from 0° to 360°, in a radial
direction, with increments of 30° between every two measurements.

GNR Fabrication
The GNRs were synthesized using the
seed-mediated growth method.53 A solution
of GNRs suspended in cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) (Sigma-Aldrich,
USA) was centrifuged at 11 000g for 10 min,
decanted, and resuspended in water to remove excess CTAB. To prevent
aggregation and to stabilize the particles in physiological solutions,
a layer of polyethylene glycol (mPEG-SH, MW 5000 g/mol) (creative
PEGWorks, Winston Salem, USA) was adsorbed onto the GNRs. A 200 μL
mixture of mPEG-SH (5 mM) (85%) and SH-PEG-COOH (1 mM) (15%) was added
to 1 mL of GNR solution. The mixture was stirred for 24 h at room
temperature. The GNR extinction coefficient spectrum was determined
using a spectrophotometer, and the resultant extinction peak was 640
nm (see Figure 8). The absorption spectrum of PEGylated GNR
solution presented the same absorption peak at 640 nm (data not shown).

Figure 8 Absorption
spectrum of the GNRs. The absorption peak is at 640
nm.

Macrophage Cell Preparation
Human peripheral blood
mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from BUFFY COAT donated from
healthy blood donors (from Sheba, Tel Hashomer Hospital Blood Bank,
Ramat Gan, Israel) by density gradient centrifugation on Ficoll-Hypaque.
Monocytes were purified by adherence to plastic in RPMI 1640 supplemented
with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. PBMCs (106 cells mL) were first seeded into 24-well plates (0.5 mL per well);
after 2 h, nonadherent cells were removed by several washes with warm
PBS. Freshly isolated monocytes differentiated into macrophages in
complete RPMI 1640 supplemented with a human recombinant macrophage
colony stimulating factor (100 ng/mL) for 6 days.

Tissue-like
Phantom Preparation
Solid phantoms were
prepared in order to simulate skin tissues with specific optical properties.54 The phantoms were prepared using India ink 0.1%,
as an absorbing component, and intralipid (IL) 20% (Lipofundin MCT/LCT
20%, B. Braun Melsungen AG, Germany), as a scattering component. All
phantoms presented the same ink and IL concentrations. Agarose powder
1% (SeaKem LE Agarose, Lonza, USA) was added to convert solution into
a gel. The solutions were heated and mixed at a temperature of approximately
90 °C, while the agarose powder was slowly added. The phantoms
were cooled under vacuum conditions to avoid bubbles. The phantoms’
solutions were stirred continuously (except for the period in which
they were solidified in a vacuum) to obtain high uniformity.

Five types of solid phantoms were prepared for different measurements:
basic phantoms, containing ink and IL only, phantoms presenting 0.2
mg/mL GNRs, phantoms with a spot of 0.2 mg/mL GNRs located within
basic phantoms, and phantoms with ∼2 × 106 cells/mL
macrophage cells post 24 h of incubation with GNRs. The phantoms with
the macrophages were prepared in a 500 μL Eppendorf, to maintain
a significant concentration of macrophages within the phantom.

Flow Cytometry
(FCM) Analysis of GNR Loading
The GNR
uptake by macrophages was analyzed by FCM scatter measurements (FACS
Aria III cell sorter, BD, USA). FCM data were analyzed with the FACSDiva
software (version 4.0, BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA). The side scatter
(SSC) and forward scatter (FSC) were determined simultaneously with
the 488 nm blue laser. Macrophages within the purified monocytes were
identified by direct immunostaining with FITC-conjugated antihuman
antibody directed against CD11b/Mac-1 (Biolegend Inc., San Diego,
CA, USA). As an isotype control, IgG-FITC (Biolegend Inc., San Diego,
CA, USA) was used.

The laser setup of the FCM included filters/mirrors
as followed: SSC/FSC measurements were performed using a 488 nm laser
with a 488/10 filter and 655, 502 low pass (LP) mirrors. The GNRs
were irradiated with a 633 nm laser with a 660/20 filter and 735 LP
mirror.

In Vivo Experiments
The in vivo experiments were performed
on C57BL mice with an atherogenic diet for 12 weeks. For the induction
of atherosclerosis, 8 week old C57BL mice were fed and maintained
on an atherogenic diet containing 15% fat, 1.25% cholesterol, and
0.5% sodium cholate (TD 90221, Food-Tek, Inc) for 12 weeks.34 As a control set, four C57BL mice were maintained
with a normal diet for 12 weeks. The mice were intravenously injected
with 6 mg of GNR and maintained on respective diet up to experimentation.
Before the DR measurements, the mice were anesthetized by intraperitoneal
injection of ketamine/xylazine and fur from their throat side was
removed to have a clear scan of carotids, without hurting the animal.
