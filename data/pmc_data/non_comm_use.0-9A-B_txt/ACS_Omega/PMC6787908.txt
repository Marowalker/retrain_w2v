The unusual temperature
behavior of the electron spin resonance
(ESR) spectra and magnetic properties are experimentally observed
in copper(II) complexes with a dendritic ligand based on the Boltorn
H30 polymer (Perstorp Specialty Chemicals AB, Sweden) functionalized
with fumaric acid residues in a molar ratio of 1:6. The ESR spectra
at low temperatures show signs of transition to higher spin states
at temperatures below 8–10 K, and the temperature dependences
of the integral ESR signal intensities and magnetic susceptibility
show the positive deviation from the Curie–Weiss law, thereby
pointing to the presence of ferromagnetic exchange interactions in
the system under study. The values of the exchange interaction parameters
are calculated by quantum-chemical simulation of the possible structure
of the copper(II) complex when assuming the formation of trinuclear
coordination sites embedded in the hyperbranched polymer structure.
The results of density functional theory calculations indicate the
possibility of ferromagnetic exchange through carboxylate bridges
in the trinuclear magnetic clusters, and the calculated values of
the exchange interaction parameters make it possible to construct
theoretical curves of the temperature dependence of the effective
magnetic moment, which satisfactorily fit the experimental data, especially
considering that polymers are characterized by disperse molecular
weights and chemical structures.

Introduction
Hyperbranched polymers
and their functionalized forms can serve
as a basis for the fabrication of various organic–inorganic
hybrid materials combining the properties of both organic and inorganic
components.1 Incorporation of transition
metals into dendrimers and highly branched polymer architectures allows
one to bring promising electrical, magnetic, optical, sensing, and
catalytic properties to this kind of materials. Hyperbranched polymers
with “imperfect” structure are more readily available
as compared to their “perfect” dendrimer counterparts
and exhibit, at the same time, comparable properties despite their
random and polydisperse molecular composition. They also can be used
as “host” systems (nanocarriers) for encapsulation of
“guest” inorganic nanoparticles (metals, metal oxides,
etc.)2,3 and templates for the synthesis of organic–inorganic
hybrid nanomaterials.4 Functionalization
of the external groups of hyperbranched macromolecules allows one
to incorporate a variety of metal ions in their interior. Metal centers
in the dendritic environment can serve as artificial models simulating
biological systems such as metalloenzymes, thereby making it possible
to study various biochemical reactions in vitro. In particular, commercial
hyperbranched polymers produced under the trademark Boltorn (Perstorp
Specialty Chemicals AB, Sweden) can be functionalized with fumaric
acid residues by the reaction with maleic anhydride.5 The resulting hyperbranched polymers contain a different
number of free carboxyl groups per macromolecule depending on the
ratio of reagents and are capable of coordinating transition metals.6 It was found that the structures and compositions
of coordination adducts of the carboxyl-functionalized dendritic oligomer
on the basis of third-generation hyperbranched polyester polyol Boltorn
H30 are quite sensitive to variation of the degree of functionalization.7 Depending on the number of monofumaric ester
groups per macromolecule, different types of complexes are formed
even with the same metal ions. Surprisingly, the electron spin resonance
(ESR) spectra of one of the synthesized copper(II) complexes with
acid-functionalized Boltorn H30, specifically, the one containing
six carboxylic acid groups on average per macromolecule, indicated
the formation of a trinuclear ferromagnetically coupled cluster with
a ground spin state of S = 3/2 in solid samples.7 It should be noted that trinuclear copper(II)
coordination systems are uncommon, especially considering that carboxylate
complexes tend to form antiferromagnetically coupled binuclear structures
with the “lantern” geometry as in well-known dimeric
copper(II) acetate.8 At the same time,
trinuclear copper clusters play a crucial role in the binding and
activation of oxygen in the multicopper oxidases.9 Hence, the obtained copper(II) triads incorporated in the
Boltron H30 dendritic architecture potentially can mimic active centers
of oxydase and oxygenase enzymes. Moreover, exchange-coupled systems
are of special interest as magnetic materials for newly developing
areas of molecular spintronics and quantum information technologies.10

Owing to the random molecular structure
of the polymer ligand and
impossibility to apply well-established diffraction methods for the
structural characterization of the coordination sites, the exact structure
of the complexes with the functionalized Boltorn H30 ligand was rather
difficult to unambiguously determine by the accessible physicochemical
methods. Moreover, further clarification of the dendritic structures
of the complexes is additionally complicated by the fact that the
infrared (IR), ultraviolet, and ESR studies indicate different geometries
of coordination sites in solution and powder samples as a result of
the coordination of solvent molecules to the metal ions.7 However, the combination of the quantum-chemical
approach and experimental studies of the magnetic properties by the
methods of ESR and magnetic susceptibility measurements allowed us
to gain insight into the structure of the coordination sites in the
synthesized copper(II) complex with the dendritic ligand based on
the Boltorn H30 polymer functionalized with fumaric acid residues
in a molar ratio of 1:6. It should be noted that the only method to
uncover structure–property relationships in this sort of “vague”
systems seems to be to simulate their structure using computational
techniques and to analyze their magnetic states at a molecular level
by using a quantum-chemical approach.

Results and Discussion
The representative structure of the starting hyperbranched polymer
ligand for the synthesis of transition complexes is shown in Figure 1. The copper(II)
complex under study was synthesized by the reaction of copper(II)
nitrate hydrate with the polymer ligand in aqueous ethanol according
to the procedure described in ref (7) and precipitated as a green-blue powder, the
IR spectrum of which was consistent with a tetrahedral coordination
geometry.

with fumaric acid residues in a 1:6 ratio.

ESR Spectra
The room-temperature ESR spectrum of a
powder sample of the copper(II) complex with acid-functionalized Boltorn
H30 consists of four lines that are denoted as 1, 2, 3, and 4 in ascending
order of the magnetic field (Figure 2). To establish the origin of these signals, the ESR
measurements were performed in the temperature range from 298 to 4.2
K (Figures 2–4).

of the copper(II) complex with functionalized
hyperbranched polymer BH30 recorded at (a) room temperature and (b)
30 K.

complex with functionalized

of 30–12 K.

Figure 4 Behavior of the ESR spectrum
of the copper(II) complex with functionalized
hyperbranched polymer BH30 in the temperature range of 9–4.5
K.

As is seen from Figure 2, the visual appearance of
the ESR spectra and the line positions
remain almost unchanged in the temperature range from 298 to 30 K,
whereas the linewidth of the signal preserves its value at about 25
Oe. At higher temperatures, the spectrum consisted of the following
four lines: lines 1, 2, and 4 with g-factor values
of 2.25, 2.18, and 2.07, respectively; and line 3 with a g-factor value of 2.15 (Figure 2a). The four-line structure of the ESR spectrum is confirmed
in Q-band measurements at room temperature, as shown below. With a
decrease in the temperature to 30 K, the amplitudes of the lines gradually
increased (Figure 2b). An increase in the amplitude of line 2 with cooling to temperatures
around 15–20 K was proportional to the trend observed in lines
1 and 4, whereas the amplitude of line 3 increases more vigorously—if
the ratio between the amplitudes of lines 3 and 4 is about 1.5:1 at
room temperature, then it becomes around 3:1 at 9 K (Figure 3a). When reaching the temperature
of around 12 K, line 3 starts to completely dominate over line 2 and
the spectrum takes almost a symmetric shape (Figure 3b). At temperatures below 9 K, all lines
broadened and were merged into a single line with a width of around
350 Oe (Figure 4).

An analysis of the temperature dependence of lines 1–4 allowed
us to consider the ESR spectrum as a sum of contributions from several
types of coordination sites, as it is natural to expect the presence
of different coordination types in such undefined structures as functionalized
Boltron H30, including the presence of copper(II) ions chemisorbed
by the hyperbranched polymer. We assume that the following two types
of paramagnetic species mainly contribute to the ESR spectra: the
low-symmetric anisotropic paramagnetic centers with nonequivalent gx, gy, and gz values; and trinuclear copper(II) clusters. Presumably, the first
type of paramagnetic centers contributes to lines 1, 2, and 4; the
second type of paramagnetic centers contributes to line 3 and partly
to lines 1 and 4.

To get further insight into the possible structure
of copper(II)
complexes embedded in the hyperbranched polymer architecture, we have
performed additional Q-band ESR measurements at room temperature and
temperatures of 20 and 9 K. The room-temperature Q-band ESR spectrum
(Figure 5) was similar
to the ESR spectrum in the X-band range, but resonance lines 1–4
in this case were narrower and well separated from each other. The
better-resolved signals made it possible to refine the corresponding g factors as equal to 2.256, 2.179, 2.148, and 2.071. No
hyperfine splitting with copper nuclei was observed in the spectra.

Figure 5 Room-temperature
Q-band ESR spectrum of the copper(II) complex
with functionalized hyperbranched polymer BH30 at a power value of
10 mW.

In addition, saturation of the
Q-band ESR signals was investigated.
An increase in the saturation power of super high-frequency radiation
at room temperature gave rise solely to an increase in the total intensity
of ESR signals, whereas the shape of the spectra and the ratio between
the line intensities do not change.

The Q-band ESR spectrum
at 9 K (Figure 6) at
a power of 0.1 mW (20 dB) was identical
to the X-band ESR spectrum at 9 K and comprised three broad lines
with g factors of 2.264, 2.151, and 2.072 (see Figure 3a). However, an increase
in the power of super high-frequency radiation up to 1 mW and above
led to drastic changes in the ESR spectra (see Figure 6a). A clearly resolved triplet of narrow
lines with a parameter of 2D ≈ 280–300
Oe emerged instead of the central broad line, which was observed up
to a power value of 10 mW and attributed to spin state S = 3/2 of the trinuclear cluster. A computer simulation of the ESR
spectrum with use of the EasySpin software package11 with parameters for the Cu3 complex (S = 3/2, g1 = 2.147, g2 = 2.147, g3 =
2.195, |D| = 0.0151 cm–1) and g values of (2.065, 2.176, 2.257) and (2.074, 2.172, 2.268)
for two types of complexes with S = 1/2 gives a good
fit to the observed ESR spectrum. Thus, the Q-band ESR measurements
clearly showed the presence of two types of paramagnetic centers:
a low-symmetric paramagnetic center with spin S =
1/2 and trinuclear sites with spin state S = 3/2
(Figure 6b).

Figure 6 Q-band ESR
spectra of copper(II) complexes embedded in a hyperbranched
polymer at 9 K: (a) transformation of the ESR spectrum with an increase
in the saturation power; (b) simulated ESR spectrum (1 mW).

At 9 K, the splitting of line 1 into two components
was also observed.
This fact can be explained by a possible slight difference in the
local coordination environment of paramagnetic copper(II) ions, for
example, some ions may be coordinated to OH groups of the hyperbranched
polymer ligand rather than to COO groups and this gives rise to a
slight difference in the g factors. A similar splitting
was observed in lines 1 and 2 of the Q-band ESR spectra recorded at
20 K, whereas line 4 was not split, but took an asymmetric shape and
apparently consisted of two components.

Conjecturing the model
of a polynuclear copper(II) cluster, we
proceeded on the basis of the following considerations: (i) the experimentally
determined characteristics, such as the temperature dependence of
the ESR spectrum [the integral intensity of the EPR spectrum was estimated
in the temperature range of 4.5–300 K and its temperature dependence
indicated the presence of a weak ferromagnetic (FM) exchange interaction
between the copper(II) ions and a positive Curie temperature] and
the magnetic susceptibility (see below), the values, and nature of
the exchange parameter, and also the external appearance of the ESR
spectra are cardinally different from the possible binuclear copper(II)
clusters with the lantern structure, which could be expected in copper(II)
carboxylates12−15 that are characterized by antiferromagnetic (AFM) coupling with
large exchange interaction parameters of around 200–300 cm–1; (ii) the number of modified branches in the hyperbranched
polymer ligand is divisible by 3 (this kind of ESR spectra were not
observed in the copper(II) complexes with the analogous hyperbranched
ligands that had a larger number of carboxylic groups);5−7 (iii) the ESR spectrum observed in this study at low temperatures
(Figure 3a) contains
the triplet splitting, which is close to the published ESR spectra
for the paramagnetic system with S = 3/2;16−25 (iv) in addition, a forbidden half-field transition (ΔMS = 2) that evidences the formation of a magnetically
coupled system is observed in the X-band ESR spectra at the resonance
field of about 1560 Oe (the g parameter is about
4.3), the ESR signal intensity of which is 2 orders of magnitude smaller
than the intensity of the main signal at g = 2.15
(see Figure A in the Supporting Information); (v) a weak FM coupling between copper(II) ions has earlier been
observed in complexes with bridging carboxylate ligands, which showed
indirect exchange interaction through the −O=C–O–
bridges in the syn–anti coordination.26−29 All the above considerations
lead to the conclusion that the trinuclear copper(II) coordination
site with a weak FM interaction is a most probable model that makes
it possible to explain the experimentally observed ESR and magnetic
properties of the system under study. However, the asymmetry of the
ESR lines at higher temperatures and a stronger manifestation of lines
1, 2, and 4 suggests the presence of copper(II) ions with S = 1/2 as well. It should also be noted that this kind
of ESR spectra and magnetic behavior is observed only in one complex
of copper(II) with a dendritic Boltorn H30 macromolecule functionalized
with six fumaric acid residues and cannot be generalized to other
Boltorn hyperbranched structures or Boltorn H30 with other degrees
of functionalization.

The Cu3 magnetic clusters known
to date are characterized
either by AFM exchange interactions leading to ground state S = l/2 or FM interactions with ground state S = 3/2. State S = 3/2 is characterized in the ESR
spectra by equidistant line splitting into a triplet. However, triplet
ESR signals of spin state S = 3/2 have been detected
earlier for both types of Cu3 clusters: (i) FM Cu3 clusters with ground state S = 3/217−19 and (ii) AFM Cu3 clusters with ground state S = 1/2, but having an excited state S = 3/2 with
a close energy level.16,17,21−25 In particular, such ESR spectra have been recorded by Choi et al.
for Cu3 magnetic clusters in the form of an equilateral
triangle embedded in polyoxometallates.23−25 Certainly, polyoxometallates
are of special importance among the Cu3 clusters, as AFM
triangular spin rings with weak intracluster exchange interactions
(|J| < 1–2 cm–1) exhibiting
the effects of spin frustration and spin chirality are created based
on them. Such a value of the coupling parameter allows one to simultaneously
observe both the ground and excited states in the Q-band or W-band
ESR spectra and also enables the effect of tunneling between two spin
states.

The X-band ESR spectra in our study, specifically, the
spectra
recorded at a temperature around 10 K, show nearly equidistant splitting
of the ESR signal into three lines, which may be manifestation of
the spin state with S = 3/2 with a nonzero value
of fine structure parameter D. Indeed, it was interesting
to compare the results of our study on the copper(II) complex embedded
in hyprbranched polyester–polyether polyol modified with fumaric
acid residues and the published data on copper(II) complexes with
polyoxometallates. In all the above cases, the fine structure is observed.
The fine-structure parameters determined in this study (|2D| ≈ 280–300 Oe) (|D| ≈
0.0140–0.0150 cm–1) are close to that of
triangular Cu3 clusters published in refs21,22 (D ≈ 0.0219–0.0240 cm–1).
The small difference between the D values is connected
with the fact that the Cu–Cu distance in a triangular cluster
in this study is about 5 Å or somewhat greater (4.96–5.41
Å), whereas it approximately equaled 4.69–4.87 Å
in the published clusters.21,22

On the other
hand, the metallodendritic system under study is different
from Cu3 clusters embedded in polyoxometallates in the
following ways:(i) The most important difference is that
we have observed FM exchange interactions in magnetic clusters embedded
in hyperbranched polymer and opposite temperature behavior of the
magnetic moment (it increases with a decrease in the temperature)
in comparison with AFM Cu3 clusters embedded in polyoxometallates.
The exchange interaction parameters in our case are also much larger
(at least 7–8 cm–1 vs 1–2 cm–1) and have an opposite sign.

(ii) Our results show that the ground
spin state of the copper complex in a hyperbranched polymer is a quartet
state with S = 3/2, whereas the ground state in polyoxometallates
was a doublet state with S = 1/2.

(iii) Only ground state S = 3/2 is detected in the ESR spectra of our samples at low temperatures
because of relatively large values of the exchange interaction parameters,
whereas the signals of both ground state S = l/2
and excited state S = 3/2 are simultaneously recorded
in the ESR spectra of polyoxometallates with a relatively small difference
in the energy of states.

(iv) A step-like magnetization curve is
observed in polyoxometallates25 under conditions
of pulse-field magnetization, which is attributable to the transitions
from the ground state with S = 1/2 to the excited
state with S = 3/2. The magnetization curves of the
system we have studied are smooth, as no spin frustrations occur and
there are no magnetization jumps.

(v) Magnetic susceptibility data for Cu3 clusters
embedded in polyoxometallates are described by a
single exchange interaction parameter (J), as the
Cu3 cluster is in the shape of an equilateral triangle.
We describe the χ(T) dependence of the Cu3 clusters embedded in the hyperbranched polymer structure
with three different exchange interaction parameters J1, J2, and J3, as follows from our density functional theory (DFT)
calculation results owing to small differences in the Cu–Cu
distances within the simulated Cu3 cluster.



Nevertheless, a comparison of the ESR spectra of the
system under
study with the set of published experimental ESR data for copper clusters,
in which the spectra of state S = 3/2 were recorded
(either ground or excited),16,17,21−25 shows that a spectral component typical for spin state S = 3/2 predominantly contributes to the total ESR spectrum in our
case. Furthermore, spin state S = 3/2 in the studied
system is a ground state.

To further confirm the assumption
about the presence of ferromagnetically
coupled trinuclear clusters in the studied copper(II) complexes embedded
in hyperbranched polymer, the temperature dependence of the total
integral intensity of the ESR lines was studied. The integral intensity
was assessed by double integration of the ESR spectrum, which actually
is the first derivative of the absorption signal. The obtained dependences
of the integral intensity, I, of the ESR signals
and its inverse value are given in Figure 7. One can see that the integral intensity
of the ESR lines sharply increases at temperatures below 8–9
K, which is consistent with the assumption about the presence of FM
exchange interactions in the studied complex. As follows from the
temperature dependence of the inverse value of the integral intensity
of ESR signals, the interaction between the Cu(II) ions should be
weakly FM and the transformation of the complex to the quartet ground
state with S = 3/2 takes place at temperatures below
8 K.

Figure 7 Temperature behavior of (a) integral intensity and (b) its inverse
value of the ESR spectrum of copper(II) complex with functionalized
hyperbranched polymer BH30.

It should be noted that there are a few published ESR spectra recorded
at different temperatures (without plotting the IESR–T dependence) for trinuclear
copper complexes with a clarified crystal structure. The published
data on IESR for an AFM Cu3 cluster (in contrast to FM interactions in this study) with ground
state S = 1/216,17 simply show that the I3/2/I1/2 ratio between
the excited (3/2) and ground (1/2) states decreases with a decrease
in the temperature. On the contrary, the intensity of state S = 3/2 in our case increases with a decrease in the temperature
(the same trend is observed for μ).

The IESR–T dependences
for the AFM Cu3 cluster were also given in ref (25), in particular, for the
intensities of two adjacent signals in a central triplet line and
a side line. The difference between them was much smaller than in
our case for lines 1 and 3 at 9 K, as is seen from Figure 3a, which evidences the existence
of two types of paramagnetic sites/complexes in our study. Moreover,
the contribution of FM couplings in our study leads to a substantially
sharper increase in the IESR–T curve slope at temperatures below 50 K in comparison with
the IESR–T curves
for an AFM Cu3 cluster.25

Magnetic Susceptibility Measurements
To complement
the ESR studies and confirm the conclusions made on the basis of the
behavior of ESR spectra at low temperatures, magnetization measurements
of the powder copper(II) complex at different temperatures were performed.
The temperature dependence of the magnetic susceptibility indicates
the deviation from the Curie–Weiss law below 8–10 K
and the presence of FM interactions in the studied spin system (Figure 8). This agrees well
with the results of ESR studies.

Figure 8 Temperature dependence of the magnetic
susceptibility and inverse
magnetic susceptibility (in the inset and on the right) of the copper(II)
complex with functionalized hyperbranched polymer BH30.

It is known that the temperature curves of the magnetic moments
for AFM and FM clusters are different: with a decrease in the temperature,
the χT and μ values decrease in AFM clusters
and increase in FM clusters. In our case, the temperature dependences
are similar to those observed for published trinuclear triangular
and linear clusters with carboxylate bridges.29−31 A similar behavior
was also observed in trinuclear FM Cu3 clusters with other
bridging groups, in particular, CuII3–pyrazolato
complexes19 and complex [(talen)CuII3], in which three Cu(II) ions are bridged through
an m-phenylene linkage.32

It should be noted that no hysteresis behavior of the field
dependence
of magnetization of the studied coper(II) complex in the temperature
region around 5 K is observed (Figure 9). Therefore, the deviation from the Curie–Weiss
law at temperatures below 8–10 K cannot be explained by the
possible presence of FM impurities. In this connection, the conjecture
that the ground spin state of the studied complex with S = 3/2 arises from a ferromagnetically coupled tricopper cluster,
which is made on the basis of the ESR data, sounds quite reasonable.

Figure 9 Field
dependence of the magnetic moment at different scanning rates
for the copper(II) complex with hyperbranched polymer Boltorn H30
functionalized with fumaric acid residues.

Actually, other possible structures, such as chain structures composed
of copper complexes with irregular lower-molecular-weight polymer
ligands, or chain structures involving separate copper(II) ions and
clusters, also may contribute to FM coupling (see Figure 10). In an indirect way, we
included these additional possibilities for different copper complexes
in a positive value of the θ parameter in the theoretical equation
of magnetic susceptibility that is given below.

Figure 10 Possible chain structure
of copper(II) complexes embedded in low-molecular-weight
species of hyperbranched polymer Boltorn H30 functionalized with fumaric
acid residues (simulated in Gaussian 09 at the PM6 semi-empirical
level; copper atoms are colored in red, carbon atoms in cyan, and
oxygen atoms in blue).

In particular, magnetization
curves similar to the one shown in Figure 9 were published for
FM and AFM Cu3 clusters,26,29,33−36 with a difference that the curves for the AFM cluster
are flatter. The shape of our magnetization curve (Figure 9) in steepness is closer to
those typical for FM clusters. Apparently, there are two components
in this curve: one component is a linear contribution from paramagnetic
copper complexes with spin S = 1/2 and another component
is a nonlinear contribution from the copper ions involved in the exchange
interactions within the polymer system (inside the magnetic clusters,
between the clusters, in chain structures, and between separate ions),
which are more strongly manifested at low temperatures. This is also
evidenced by the ESR spectra. The magnetization curve in Figure 9 is recorded at 5
K, that is, the temperature at which exchange interaction mechanisms
are already strongly manifested.

DFT Calculations
To elucidate the structural features
that lead to such unusual magnetic behavior of the copper(II) complex
of carboxyl-functionalized hyperbranched polymer Boltorn H30, the
quantum-chemical simulations were performed using the Gaussian software
package.37 To construct trinuclear copper(II)
clusters embedded in the dendritic structure, the preoptimized structure
of the acid-functionalized hyperbranched polymer was transformed to
bring free carboxylic acid groups close to each other into the orientation
favorable for assembling the trigonal coordination sites with carboxyl
bridges. The nitrate counter ions were abandoned for the sake of simplicity,
and the closest coordination spheres of the copper(II) cations were
filled with water molecules. The obtained raw structure of the dendritic
complex with two trinuclear coordination sites per macromolecule was
optimized to the first stationary point at the semi-empirical UPM6
level (Figure 11a).
To obtain a better starting geometry for higher levels of theory,
the full hyperbranched structure was truncated at the central carbon
atom of the dendritic core, and the resulting half structure was optimized
at the DFT UB3LYP level with the 3-21G basis set until reaching the
stationary point with a simplified coarse integration grid and loose
convergence criterion (Figure 11b).

Figure 11 (a) Full structure of the complex of copper(II) with hyperbranched
polymer Boltorn H30 functionalized with fumaric acid residues in a
molar ratio of 1:6, in which two possible coordination triads are
shown by multilayer selection in GaussView; (b) half of the structure
cropped out from the full dendritic structure at the central core
carbon atom that is shown on the left as a ball atom with two methyl
groups added in place of the deleted part of the polymer structure
(copper atoms are colored in red, carbon atoms in cyan, hydrogen atoms
in gray, and oxygen atoms in blue).

Next, the trinuclear coordination site with the fumaric acid fragments
was detached from the rest of the structure and processed at the DFT
UB3LYP level with more complex basis sets in a fine integration grid.
The coordinates of the fumarate “arms” were fixed at
the positions, as if the coordination site still would be attached
to a dendritic matrix, by fixing the coordinates of the methyl carbon
atoms that have replaced the deleted polymer fragment. An almost equilateral
triangle with copper(II) cations at the apexes was obtained after
the geometry optimization at higher levels of theory (Figure 12). The closest coordination
surroundings of the copper(II) ions of two coordination sites in the
trinuclear cluster have the configuration of a distorted tetrahedron
with the oxygen atoms at the vertices, and one of the coordination
sites has an almost planar structure. Generally, the Cu–O bond
lengths are different and vary in the range from 1.88 to 2.07 Å
for different positions in the coordination sites, and also depending
on the level of theory used in the geometry optimization. The described
coordination triad hereinafter is referred to as “configuration
I”.

simulated
at the UB3LYP 6-311G++(2d,2p) level for configuration I.

The other half of the preoptimized full structure of the
hyperbranched
polymer with embedded coordination triads (Figure 11a) was also treated as above. The coordination
triad obtained after performing DFT calculations at higher levels
of theory, which is referred to as “configuration II”,
was similar to configuration I by the mutual arrangement of the embedded
copper(II) cations, but all three coordination sites in this version
of a trinuclear cluster had close geometries. The Cu–O bond
lengths in configuration II are in the same range as in configuration
I.

Table 1 shows
the
parameters of the coordination triangles (the triangle sides a, b, and c) for configurations
I and II, which were obtained after the geometry optimization of the
simplified trinuclear coordination clusters by different DFT methods.

The DFT calculation results for two
random configurations I and
II of the trinuclear coordination site, in which the spin states in
separate paramagnetic centers were controlled using the fragmentation
procedure, are given in Table 2. The isotropic exchange interaction parameters are calculated
by the broken symmetry (BS) approach using the Ruiz scheme.38 The exchange interaction parameters obtained
with widely used hybrid functional, such as B3LYP and SEH1PBE, give
fairly large positive values
for each of the coupling pairs in configuration I and confirm the
experimentally observed quartet ground state in the studied spin system.
It was found earlier that the exchange interaction parameters in the
case of transition-metal complexes are best described by the LC-ωPBE
exchange correlation functional.39,40 In addition,
the UWB97XD long-range corrected hybrid functional with empirical
dispersion corrections has proven to perform well for noncovalent
interactions.41 The obtained exchange coupling
constants with the latter two functionals are almost in the same range
as in the first two cases. For configuration II, larger discrepancies
are observed in the results obtained with different hybrid functionals.
However, an overall tendency to form quartet ground state is confirmed,
and the results obtained with the more reliable LC-ωPBE and
UWB97XD functionals are still comparable.

Indeed,
even a larger number of conformational variations are possible
in reality for trinuclear coordination sites embedded in the hyperbranched
polymer structure, not to mention isolated copper(II) ions and other
coordination possibilities, for example, linearly arranged copper(II)
clusters connected through carboxylate bridges. But once formed, trinuclear
copper(II) clusters contribute to higher spin states at temperatures
below 8–10 K and cause the deviation from the Curie–Weiss
law.

As was shown for copper(II) formate complexes, two types
of mechanisms
can be involved in the exchange interaction between copper(II) paramagnetic
centers through carboxylate links.42 It
was found that one superexchange path through π orbitals of
the C=O groups contributes predominantly to AFM coupling and
a superexchange path through σ bonds contributes to FM coupling
by a spin-polarization mechanism. In a modification of copper(II)
formate complex with syn–anti bonding arrangement of Cu–O–C–O–Cu
links, a predominant FM behavior with a positive Curie–Weiss
constant of 17 K was observed at low temperatures. Predominance of
FM coupling was also found in other copper(II) carboxylate linked
complexes with syn–anti coordination.43−45 A spin-polarization
mechanism of superexchange through σ bonds implies a significant
negative spin density population on the carbon atoms of carboxylate
links and this is confirmed in our calculation results as well (see
Figure B in the Supporting Information).

Fitting of the Theoretically Calculated Data to the Experimental
Results of Magnetic Susceptibility Measurements
Using different
sets of the calculated exchange coupling constants in the tricopper(II)
complexes embedded in the hyperbranched polymer structure, theoretical
curves for the temperature dependence of the effective magnetic moment,
μeff, fitted to the experimental data are obtained
(Figure 13, the curves
in the χT–T coordinates
are given in Figure C of the Supporting Information and look similar). The theoretical curves were obtained taking into
account the contribution of single paramagnetic centers that may be
present in the molecule, as follows 1   2  where χ is the total value
of the magnetic
susceptibility of the system, χcl is the magnetic
susceptibility related to trinuclear magnetic clusters, χpar is the magnetic susceptibility related to single paramagnetic
centers, m is the average number of clusters per
molecule, and n is the average number of single paramagnetic
centers per molecule. The magnetic susceptibility of trinuclear magnetic
clusters as a function of temperature is described by the following
formula derived from the van Fleck equation including the energy gaps
between the possible spin eigenstates46,47 3  where
ΔE1 = E1/2+ – E1/2–; ΔE2 = E1/2+ – E3/2    

Figure 13 Temperature dependences of the experimental and theoretically calculated
effective magnetic moments (B.M.) of the copper(II) complex with the
hyperbranched polymer ligand based on Boltorn H30. The theoretical
curves are calculated using eqs 1–4 with the following parameters: m = 2; n = 4; θ = 4.2 K; g1/2+ = 2.1; g1/2– = 2.2; g3/2 = 2.3; gpar = 2.2; and the J12, J23, and J13 parameters
are taken from Table 2 (the numbers at the curves correspond to table rows from top to
bottom). The experimental curve is obtained using a molecular weight
of about 3000 g/mol (a number-averaged molecular weight of 1410 g/mol
is adopted for Boltorn H30).

In eq 3, the parameter
θ is the adjustment to the temperature that takes into account
possible intermolecular exchange interactions between the clusters
and possible presence of interacting chain structures at low temperatures.

The temperature dependence of the magnetic susceptibility related
to single paramagnetic centers can be calculated by the well-known
formula 4  

In this
regard, it should be noted that the processing of the experimental
data on magnetic susceptibilities implied using a certain value of
the molecular weight for the polymer complex, at the same time as
real polymer molecules vary in size. Hence, the molecule shown in Figure 1 does not represent
an “average” molecule of the real polymer complex. When
processing the experimentally measured magnetic properties, the number-averaged
molecular weight, that is, the molecular weight determined as an arithmetic
mean of the molecular weights of n polymer molecules,
was used. In turn, the available data on the molecular weight distribution
of Boltorn polymers differ depending on the used experimental methods.
The corrected value of the number-averaged molecular weight of Boltorn
H30 (1410 g/mol) is published,48 which
is substantially different from the number-averaged molecular weight
of Boltorn H30 provided in the manufacturer’s specification
(2333 g/mol). The resulting experimental curves processed using these
different values for the molecular weight of the hyperbranched polymer
core are shown in Figure 14. The theoretical curves obtained in the present study are
fitted to the experimental curve processed using the number-averaged
molecular weight for the copper(II) hyperbranched polymer complex
calculated on the basis of the published experimental data for Boltorn
H30.48

effective magnetic
moments (B.M.) processed with different conditional molecular weights
of the studied copper(II) dendritic complex (from top to bottom):
calculated on the basis of the chemical structure given in Figure 1, based on the number-averaged
molecular weight for Boltorn H30 specified by the manufacturer Perstorp
Specialty Chemicals AB, and based on the experimentally corrected
molecular weight for Boltorn H30.

As is seen from Figure 13, the obtained theoretical curves slightly deviate from the
experimental data. The character of deviations suggests that the real
system has components with larger values of the exchange interaction
parameter. It can be explained by the fact that the simulated structure
of the coordination site is conformationally flexible and many configurations
are possible in the real system under study. Therefore, the exchange
interaction parameters between paramagnetic centers in the studied
hyperbranched polymer complex must vary in a very wide range. In addition,
the possible presence of short linearly arranged exchange-coupled
chains is not taken into account in the used model. Notwithstanding
that the performed quantum-chemical calculations do not embrace all
the diversity of possible chemical configurations of the studied magnetic
system, they give the data for building a crude approximate model
of the magnetically interacting system, rather satisfactorily explaining
the observed experimental data.

Methods
Experimental
Measurements
X-band ESR spectra were recorded
in Bruker-ESR-300 and Bruker-EMX X-band ESR spectrometers in the range
of temperatures 4.2–260 K by using nitrogen and helium flow
cryostats (Oxford Instruments). The Q-band spectra were recorded in
an Elexsys E580 pulse EPR spectrometer equipped with an ER 5106 QTW
standard commercial cavity (Bruker).

Magnetic properties of
a powder sample were studied using a vibrating sample magnetometer
integrated into a system for the measurement of physical properties
(PPMS-9, Quantum Design). The sample was loaded into a gelatin container,
which was then attached to a standard copper holder with glue. Temperature-dependent
magnetization measurements were performed in a magnetic field of 5
kOe in the temperature range of 5–300 K. Contributions of the
sample holder and the container to the magnetization value were subtracted
by measuring them separately from the sample. A diamagnetic contribution
from the ligand to the measured magnetic susceptibility was taken
into account using the Pascal additive scheme.

Calculation Techniques
The chemical structure of the
initial Boltorn H30 with fumaric acid functions was first optimized
at the semi-empirical PM6 level in a Gaussian 09 software package,37 and three nearby fumaric acid groups were aligned
using the GaussView software package by rotation around appropriate
single bonds of the hyperbranched core in such a way that carboxylic
acid groups get close to each other and make a triangle. Then, a trigonal
tricopper(II) coordination site was assembled using three carboxyl
groups as linkers between the metal ions and water molecules for filling
the coordination spheres, by taking into account the fact that the
studied complex has a tetrahedral structure with a coordination number
of 4, as has previously been established from the results of the IR
spectroscopy studies.7 To simplify further
calculations, the branches of the dendritic structure that are not
involved in coordination with metal ions were truncated at the core
central carbon atom and replaced with methyl groups. The assembled
structure was optimized in Gaussian 09 at the UPM6 level and the initial
geometry of the trinuclear coordination site embedded in the hyperbranched
polymer ligand was obtained. It was further optimized at the DFT UB3LYP
level with the minimal 3-21G basis set. The coordination site was
cropped out from the hyperbranched polymeric part at the binding sites
with fumaric acid residues, and methyl groups were attached to the
latter. The obtained simplified complex was optimized by the DFT method
with fixed coordinates for the methyl carbon atoms that replace the
hyperbranched polymer core, using the UB3LYP, UWB97XD, ULC-wPBE, and
USEH1PBE hybrid functionals with different basis sets. The different
spin states that are obtained by consecutive flipping of spins in
each fragment were computed using unrestricted single-point calculations
of the fragmented coordination triangle. The corresponding three pairwise
coupling constants for the triangular spin system were obtained solving
the set of equations derived from the Heisenberg–Dirack–van
Vleck spin Hamiltonian in the isotropic Ising configuration 5  

The broken
symmetry approach was applied
to extract the pairwise exchange interaction constants. This approach
developed by Ruiz for polynuclear systems38 uses the FM and broken symmetry (AFM) DFT solutions to map them
into the corresponding Ising energies. In particular, four unique
microstates were obtained applying the fragmentation procedure to
control the spin states of the individual paramagnetic centers, which
made it possible to unequivocally define all three exchange coupling
constants from the set of equations describing one ferromagnetically
coupled high-spin state and three independent AFM broken-symmetry
states.

Conclusions
A copper(II) complex
with a commercial hyperbranched polymer Boltorn
H30 (Perstorp Specialty Chemicals AB, Sweden) functionalized with
six fumaric acid residues is studied by the methods of EPR spectroscopy
study and magnetic susceptibility measurements. The EPR spectra of
a powder sample of the synthesized copper(II) complex demonstrated
four resonance lines with different temperature behavior, suggesting
the presence of paramagnetic species with a total spin of 3/2 that
can arise from magnetically coupled copper(II) clusters. To confirm
the assumption about the ferromagnetically coupled trinuclear copper(II)
coordination sites, the temperature dependence of the total integral
intensity of the EPR lines was studied. The integrated intensity of
the EPR spectrum sharply increases at temperatures below 8–9
K, which is consistent with the assumption about the presence of FM
exchange interactions in the studied complex. Magnetic susceptibility
measurements of the studied powder copper(II) complex confirm conclusions
drawn on the basis of the behavior of the EPR spectra at low temperatures.
The temperature dependence of the magnetic susceptibility shows deviation
from the Curie–Weiss law below 10 K and indicates the presence
of FM exchange interactions in the studied system. Quantum-chemical
simulation of the proposed structure for the trinuclear copper(II)
coordination sites embedded in the hyperbranched polymer architecture
also gives positive values for the exchange interaction parameters.
Thus, the combination of the quantum-chemical approach and experimental
studies of the magnetic properties by the methods of ESR and magnetic
susceptibility measurements allowed us to gain insight into the feasible
structure of the coordination sites in the synthesized copper(II)
hyperbranched polymer complex despite the impossibility of unambiguous
determination of its chemical structure by the accessible physicochemical
methods. The theoretical magnetic curves obtained on the basis of
the calculated exchange interaction parameters between copper(II)
ions in the hyperbranched polymer globule roughly fit the experimental
data. The slight deviations are explainable considering the complexity
of the real polymer system and the diversity of possible chemical
surroundings of paramagnetic sites, which cannot be fully accounted
for in quantum-chemical calculations.
