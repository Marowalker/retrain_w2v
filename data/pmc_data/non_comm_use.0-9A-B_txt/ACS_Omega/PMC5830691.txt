A spectroscopic
study of an organocatalytic Henry reaction between
nitroalkanes and aldehydes catalyzed by a quinidine-derived Cinchona alkaloid is described. The binding modes
of the reaction substrates are investigated using electronic absorption
and fluorescence spectroscopy and further corroborated by nuclear
magnetic resonance measurements. Aldehydes are shown to associate
with both the 6′-OH group and the basic quinuclidine nitrogen
of the catalyst, whereas nitroalkanes do not exhibit a clear binding
mode. Reaction progress kinetic analysis reveals that the reaction
is first-order in both of the substrates and the catalyst. Second,
the reaction proceeds approximately five times faster in the excess
of the nitroalkanes than in the excess of the aldehydes, suggesting
that binding of the aldehydes results in the inhibition of the catalyst.
Aldehydes deactivate the basic quinuclidine site, thus suppressing
the deprotonation of the nitroalkanes which is the proposed initial
step in the reaction cycle.

Introduction
The biological activity
of many pharmaceutical compounds, agrochemicals,
flavors, and fragrances depends on the absolute stereochemistry of
the molecules.1−3 The growing demand for such chiral molecules has
made enantioselective synthesis one of the main goals in organic chemistry
during the 21st century.4 Employment of
asymmetric catalysts, such as transition metal complexes or small
organic molecules, also known as organocatalysts, represents an effective
way toward the synthesis of chiral molecules.5−9 Transition metal catalysts often suffer from several
drawbacks such as high price, toxicity, and sensitivity toward ambient
conditions. Asymmetric organocatalysts, on the other hand, offer a
“green”, metal-free, nontoxic, and low-cost route toward
these valuable chemicals and have received increasing attention during
the last decades.10−17

Among the known organocatalysts, Cinchona alkaloid-derived compounds hold a special position and have been
used in numerous C–C bond-forming organocatalytic reactions
with high yields and enantioselectivities. The Cinchona alkaloids are available from natural sources as pairs of pseudoenantiomers,
such as quinine and quinidine, which differ only in their absolute
configuration at C8 and C9. Since the chirality
of the catalyst is transferred to the product, the employment of a
pseudoenantiomeric pair in asymmetric catalysis gives easy access
to both enantiomers of the same product.15,18−20 The naturally occurring alkaloids contain several
functional groups including a basic and nucleophilic quinuclidine,
a quinoline unit, a secondary alcohol, and a terminal olefin. The
functional richness of the abundant alkaloids allows their conversion
to more efficient catalysts with different functionalities21,22 or immobilization on a support23−25 in a few synthetic steps.

The catalytic versatility of the Cinchona alkaloid catalysts arises from two key factors: conformational flexibility
and bifunctionality.26−28 This was already recognized in the pioneering work
of Hiemstra and Wynberg in 1981.29 The Cinchona alkaloids can easily undergo rotations around
the C9–C8 and the C9–C4′ bonds (Chart 1) and exist mainly
in four different conformations.26,28 The bifunctionality,
on the other hand, is attributed to interactions of the substrates
with the basic quinuclidine nitrogen (nucleophile, hydrogen-bond acceptor)
and the hydroxyl group (electrophile, hydrogen-bond donor) of the
catalyst. The quinuclidine moiety is able to activate a nucleophile,
and the hydroxyl group can activate an electrophile or assist in the
orientation of the substrates via hydrogen bonding. Despite the large
number of mechanistic studies by means of nuclear magnetic resonance
(NMR), reaction kinetics, and computational techniques, the understanding
of the overall mechanisms of Cinchona alkaloid-catalyzed reactions remains limited.26,27,29−39 In particular, experimental observation of the reaction intermediates
is challenging because of the transient and noncovalent nature of
the interactions between the catalyst and the substrates.

Chart 1 Structures
the Cinchona Alkaloid Cupreidine-Derived
Catalyst and the Model Substrates of the Henry Reaction
The functional groups responsible
for the catalytic activity can
also facilitate different photophysical processes together with the
built-in quinoline chromophore. The hydroxy-substituted quinoline
is an excited-state acid and can undergo intramolecular or intermolecular
excited-state proton transfer.40−42 In addition, the quinuclidine
moiety is a good electron donor resulting in quenching of the locally
excited (LE) emission of the quinoline and the appearance of a long-wavelength
charge-transfer emission band in polar solvents.43−45 These processes
are affected by various hydrogen bonding and protonating agents such
as water, acids, bases, and the reaction substrates. Therefore, monitoring
of the spectroscopic properties (absorption and emission) potentially
enables the observation of weak noncovalent interactions with high
sensitivity.

The aim of the present study is to use electronic
absorption and
emission spectroscopy combined with NMR spectroscopy and reaction
progress kinetic analysis to study the binding modes and reaction
mechanisms of Cinchona alkaloid-derived
catalysts. We chose Henry reaction (Scheme 1) as the model reaction.46−48 The Henry reaction
is a base-catalyzed C–C bond-forming reaction between nitroalkanes
and aldehydes or ketones. According to the mechanism reported in the
literature, the initial step is a deprotonation of the weakly acidic
nitroalkane on the α-carbon followed by a nucleophilic attack
to the carbonyl-containing substrate to give a potentially chiral
β-nitro alkoxide. Protonation of the alkoxide by the protonated
base yields the β-nitro alcohol as a product. In Cinchona alkaloids and their derivatives, the quinuclidine
moiety acts as the base, whereas the hydroxyl group helps to orient
the carbonyl compound via hydrogen bonding.49,50

Scheme 1 General Mechanism of the Base-Catalyzed Henry Reaction
The investigated catalyst is
the 9-benzyl ether of cupreidine (BnCPD),51 and the model reaction
substrates are butyraldehyde (BA), 4-nitrobenzaldehyde
(4-NO2PhA), and
4-trifluoromethyl-benzaldehyde (4-CF3PhA) as the carbonyl compounds and nitromethane
(MeNO2) and nitroethane (EtNO2) as the nitroalkanes (Chart 1). All measurements
are performed in tetrahydrofuran (THF) which is the most used solvent
with the current catalyst and reaction.52 The photophysical properties of BnCPD in different
solvents, and upon addition of model hydrogen bonding and protonating
agents, have been investigated previously in our group.43,45 Here, we report on a photophysical characterization of BnCPD in the presence of model substrates complemented by NMR measurements
to study the binding modes of the individual substrates. Second, we
present the reaction progress kinetic analysis studies of two model
reactions to gain deeper insights into the reaction mechanism.

Results
and Discussion
Binding Mode of the Nitroalkanes
According to the literature,
the binding mode of nitroalkanes in the Henry reaction is deprotonation
by the basic quinuclidine yielding a contact ion pair which is further
stabilized by hydrogen bonding with the hydroxyl group.50 We have previously shown that the fluorescence
decay of BnCPD in neat THF exhibits two main decay components
with time constants of ca. 360 ps and 1.7 ns. The two time constants
were attributed to two different conformations of the catalyst, where
in one of them, the fluorescence is quenched by either a photoinduced
electron-transfer or a proton-transfer process. Moreover, deactivation
of the quinuclidine nitrogen by protonation (or hydrogen bonding)
suppresses these quenching processes and results in the recovery of
the unquenched LE emission.43,45 Therefore, addition
of a nitroalkane is expected to increase the LE emission and suppress
the relative amplitude of the quenched component, assuming that the
binding mode involves protonation of the quinuclidine nitrogen. Association
of the nitroalkane with the quinuclidine is not expected to affect
the absorption spectrum of the catalyst in the wavelength range >280
nm.

The steady-state absorption spectrum of BnCPD does not exhibit any changes upon the addition of MeNO2 (Figure S2, Supporting Information). Because of the absorption of MeNO2 at the excitation wavelength (330 nm),
the emission spectra, presented in Figure 1a, were corrected for the primary inner-filter
effect (IFE). Contrary to our expectations, the emission intensity
decreases upon increasing the concentration of MeNO2. Similar fluorescence quenching of anthracene
by MeNO2 has been reported in
the literature53 and was also observed
by us in a reference measurement.

Figure 1 (a) Steady-state emission spectra of BnCPD (c = 30 μM) in THF upon addition
of MeNO2. The spectra are corrected
for the primary
IFE (see text). The excitation wavelength was 330 nm. (b) Stern–Volmer
plots of the uncorrected and primary IFE-corrected emission intensities
monitored at 366 nm.

We used the Stern–Volmer analysis, as shown in eq 1, to determine the quenching
constant
from the steady-state emission spectra. 1  In the above equation, F0 and F are the fluorescence intensities in
the absence and presence of the quencher (MeNO2), KSV is the Stern–Volmer
quenching constant, and [Q] is the quencher concentration. The Stern–Volmer
plots of the uncorrected and primary IFE-corrected fluorescence data
monitored at the maximum (366 nm) are presented in Figure 1b. The Stern–Volmer
plot of the uncorrected data exhibits a slight upward curvature, and
the determined Stern–Volmer constant is almost two times higher
than that for the corrected data. This emphasizes the importance of
the IFE correction. The determined Stern–Volmer constant from
the corrected spectra is KSV = 8.4 M–1.

The nature of the quenching was investigated
by using time-resolved
fluorescence. The fluorescence decays of BnCPD upon addition
of MeNO2 in THF were measured
using the time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC) setup and
are presented in Figure 2a together with the instrument response function (IRF). The decays
were monitored close to the emission maximum at 370 nm. As discussed
above, BnCPD exhibits two main decay components in neat
THF attributed to two different conformations of the molecule.45 Therefore, the decay curves were analyzed using
a biexponential model, and an amplitude-weighted average lifetime,
as shown in eq 2, was
used for the Stern–Volmer analysis.54 2  In eq 2 αi is the
relative amplitude
of the corresponding decay time, τi. In the case of pure dynamic (collisional) quenching, the Stern–Volmer
equation becomes 3  In the above equation, τ0 and τ are the average
lifetimes in the absence and presence
of the quencher and KD is the dynamic
Stern–Volmer quenching constant. The Stern–Volmer plots
of the individual lifetimes and the amplitude-weighted average lifetime
are presented in Figure 2b. The fit parameters of the individual decays are summarized in
Table S1 (Supporting Information).

Figure 2 (a) Fluorescence
decays of BnCPD (c = 30 μM) in
THF upon addition of MeNO2 together
with the IRF. The excitation wavelength was
322 nm and the monitoring wavelength was 370 nm. (b) Stern–Volmer
plots of the individual lifetimes, τ1 and τ2, and the amplitude-weighted average lifetime τaver. The lifetimes in the absence of MeNO2 are τ1 = 0.3 ns, τ2 = 1.7 ns, and τaver = 0.8 ns.

The Stern–Volmer plot exhibits linear behavior
with KD = 8.4 M–1, determined
from
the amplitude-weighted average lifetime. The value is identical to
that determined from the steady-state measurements. This strongly
suggests that the observed changes in the fluorescence intensity can
be fully explained by considering dynamic quenching by MeNO2 without the need to invoke any binding
mechanism. However, the relative amplitude of the faster decay component
slightly decreases and that of the longer component increases upon
the addition of MeNO2 (see Table S1). This could indicate that a small fraction
(<3%) of the catalyst forms a complex with MeNO2, which results in the protonation of the quinuclidine
nitrogen and generation of longer-lived fluorescent species. The upper
limit for the association constant can be estimated to be Keq < 0.30 ± 0.05. Alternatively, the
association constant can be estimated from the relative acidities
of MeNO2 () and the protonated quinuclidine nitrogen
() according to .
The pKa value
of MeNO2 is 10.2, whereas that
of the quinuclidine group in quinine/quinidine-derived Cinchona alkaloids is 8.8–9.7.43,55−57 This results in an association constant of 0.04 < Keq < 0.32, in good agreement with the value
estimated above.

To investigate the binding mode further, we
measured proton NMR
(1H NMR) spectra of BnCPD in the absence and
presence of the nitroalkanes, (MeNO2) and (EtNO2), at concentrations
representative for catalytic reactions in THF-d8. The concentrations of the samples were BnCPD (14 mM) + MeNO2 (140 mM) and BnCPD (29 mM) + EtNO2 (290 mM). The 1H NMR spectra showed only a broadening
of the 6′-OH proton signal (δ = 8.97 ppm) of BnCPD upon the addition of nitroalkanes (Figure S3, Supporting Information). The broadening can be attributed
to dynamic hydrogen-bonding interactions between the nitroalkanes
and the catalyst. No shifts in any of the proton signals of the quinuclidine
moiety were observed, which means that the concentration of the protonated
catalysts is very low. However, assuming the upper limit of Keq < 0.3 as determined above, the concentration
of the binary complex would be on the order of the detection limit
of NMR measurements (ca. 5%).

Binding Mode of the Aldehydes
The carbonyl compounds,
in this case, the aldehydes, are assumed to bind to the catalyst via
hydrogen bonding to the quinoline 6′-OH group. This is expected
to influence the spectroscopic properties of the catalyst. The absorption
and emission spectra of BnCPD upon the addition of BA are presented in Figure 3. Absorption of BA has been subtracted
from the total absorption, and the emission spectra have been corrected
for the primary IFE.

Figure 3 Steady-state (a) absorption and (b) emission spectra of BnCPD (c = 20 μM) in THF upon addition
of BA. Absorption of BA has been subtracted
from
that of the BnCPD sample, and the emission spectra are
corrected for the primary IFE. The excitation wavelength was 330 nm.

Addition of BA results
in clear changes both in the
absorption and the emission spectra of the catalyst. The absorption
exhibits a broadening and a red shift of the main absorption band
originating from the quinoline moiety. The emission spectra exhibit
a decrease in the LE emission and an appearance of a long-wavelength
emission band with a maximum at ∼430 nm and a shoulder at ∼520
nm. The observed changes are similar to those observed upon addition
of a strong base which results in deprotonation of the quinoline 6′-OH
group.45 This strongly suggests that anionic
species are formed upon the addition of BA.

Substituted
aromatic aldehydes have relatively strong absorption
in the absorption range of the catalyst. We therefore investigated
only unsubstituted benzaldehyde. The absorption and emission spectra
of BnCPD upon the addition of benzaldehyde are presented
in Figure S4 (Supporting Information),
and the spectra are corrected as in the case of BA. Addition
of benzaldehyde results qualitatively in similar changes as the addition
of BA. This suggests a similar mode of action for both
aldehydes. The sensitivity of the catalyst toward the addition of
benzaldehyde is, however, lower compared to that of BA.

Determination of association constants was not possible for
either
of the aldehydes. This was due to the poorly reproducible quantitative
behavior upon addition of the aldehydes. The observed spectroscopic
changes were dependent on the light exposure as demonstrated by control
measurements. Continuous monitoring of the long-wavelength emission
intensity of a fresh BnCPD + BA sample at
430 nm showed that the emission intensity increases with time. Moreover,
the increase was faster when the sample was excited at the absorption
maximum of the aldehyde. Second, a single addition of 33 mM benzaldehyde
did not reproduce the changes observed upon the incremental additions.
However, the emission showed a gradual increase similar to that presented
in Figure 3b when the
emission spectra were measured several times after each other without
changing the sample nor the experimental conditions. The observed
changes were clearly dependent on the light exposure of the sample
but, unfortunately, selective excitation of the catalyst was not possible
because of the overlap with the aldehyde absorption.

The nature
of the long-wavelength emission band was also investigated
by using time-resolved fluorescence. The decays were monitored between
360 and 500 nm and fitted globally with a three-exponential model
convolved with the measured IRF. The excitation wavelength was 315
nm. The decay-associated spectra (DAS, see Supporting Information) of BnCPD in the presence of BA are presented in Figure 4. The decays exhibit three main components. The two
faster components (τ1 = 0.54 ns and τ2 = 1.3 ns), responsible for the LE emission, are similar to those
observed for BnCPD in neat THF (τ1 =
0.36 ns and τ2 = 1.7 ns).45 Although the lifetimes are slightly different, these components
can be attributed to the two conformations of BnCPD similar
to the case in neat THF. The main component responsible for the red-shifted
emission has a significantly longer lifetime (τ3 =
7.3 ns) characteristic of an anionic species. The shorter components
do not exhibit significant negative amplitude in the long-wavelength
region. This suggests that the long-wavelength-emitting species is
formed directly upon the excitation of a ground-state species, not
photochemically via a transient state, for example, the LE state of
the neutral catalyst. Similar behavior was observed for BnCPD in the presence of benzaldehyde (Figure S5, Supporting Information). Although the formation of the anionic
species is photochemically irreversible, addition of an acid to the
reaction mixture after light exposure resulted in the recovery of
the LE emission and disappearance of the long-wavelength emission.
The DAS of the BnCPD/BA mixture upon addition
of an acid are presented in Figure S6.
The results demonstrate that 6′-hydroxyquinoline moiety remains
intact in the anionic species, and the deprotonation/protonation of
the 6′-OH is chemically reversible.

spectra of BnCPD (c = 40 μM) in
the presence of BA (c = 15 mM) in THF.
The inset shows the individual χ2-values. The excitation
wavelength was 315 nm.

Again, we turned to 1H NMR measurements to study
the
binding mode of the aldehydes at catalytic concentrations and to avoid
the irreversible photochemical reaction. 1H NMR spectra
of BnCPD were measured in the presence of all three aldehydes.
Representative 1H NMR spectra of BnCPD in
the absence and presence of 4-CF3PhA are presented in Figure 5. The protons of BnCPD exhibiting
significant changes in their chemical shifts are indicated in the
figure.

Figure 5 1H NMR spectra of BnCPD (0.02 mmol, c = 29 mM) in the absence (blue) and presence (red) of 4-CF3PhA (0.2 mmol, c = 290 mM) in THF-d8. The protons
of the catalyst exhibiting significant changes in their chemical shifts
are indicated in the figure.

Addition of all three aldehydes results in downfield shifts
of
multiple proton signals of the catalyst. The changes are largest upon
the addition of 4-CF3PhA. The aldehydes exhibit a clear association with the 6′-OH
group resulting in a strong broadening and red shift of the proton
signal at δ = 8.97 ppm. In addition, the spectra show shifts
in the proton signals of the quinuclidine moiety. The shifts are especially
clear for the hydrogen that are nearest to the basic quinuclidine
nitrogen at δ = 2.5–3.3 ppm (H2, H6, and H8). Interestingly,
the H12 protons of the side group also exhibit a small shift. This
possibly results from a change in the conformation of the catalyst.
Binding of the aldehydes to the catalytic pocket most likely increases
the population of a conformation in which the substrate is simultaneously
bound to both the 6′-OH and the quinuclidine nitrogen. Wang
and co-workers reported similar observations for a thiourea-functionalized Cinchona alkaloid.31 Addition
of a single reaction substrate, in their case, the nucleophile, (N-Boc-α,β-unsaturated-γ-butyrolactam)
to a solution of the catalyst in C6D6 resulted
in downfield shifts of most of the catalyst proton signals. This was
attributed to an association of the substrate with both the basic
quinuclidine and the hydrogen-bond donating thiourea moieties of the
catalyst.

The ultraviolet–visible (UV–vis) measurements
demonstrated
a clear interaction between the catalyst and the aldehydes but the
excitation of the complex resulted in the irreversible formation of
“anionic” species. 1H NMR measurements supported
the complex formation and showed that the aldehydes interact with
both the 6′-OH group and the quinuclidine moiety. Possible
structures of the complex and the “anionic” photoproduct
of BnCPD with BA are presented in Scheme 2. According to the
proposed binding mode, the hydrogen bond of the 6′-OH group
to the aldehydes decreases the electron density on the carbonyl carbon,
which then associates with the lone pair of the basic quinuclidine
nitrogen. This is enabled by the close proximity and favorable orientation
of the two functional groups in the active (i.e., anticlosed)29 conformation of the catalyst. Excitation of
this neutral complex results in the proton transfer to the carbonyl
oxygen and the formation of a covalent bond between the quinuclidine
nitrogen and carbonyl carbon. Addition of an acid to the zwitterionic
complex protonates the 6′-O–, recovering
the neutral LE emission of the quinoline moiety.

Scheme 2 Proposed Binding
Mode of the Aldehydes and the Structure of the Zwitterionic
Photoproduct Observed in the UV–Vis Measurements
Because we did not observe
a clear binding of the nitroalkanes,
we consider the possibility that the neutral complex between the aldehyde
and the catalyst could be the initial species in the catalytic cycle
contrary to the mechanism proposed in the literature. We explored
this possibility by kinetic studies.

Kinetic Studies of the
Henry Reaction
We started the
kinetic studies by exploring a reaction between MeNO2 and 4-NO2PhA catalyzed by BnCPD in THF-d8. Enantiomeric excesses up to 40% with the S absolute configuration of the major enantiomer have been reported
for this reaction.52 The reaction scheme
and the samples are presented in Table 1. The aim was to determine the reaction order in each
substrate by monitoring the reaction in a large excess of one of the
substrates (entries 1 and 4). The order in the catalyst was determined
from the relative rate constants at different catalyst loadings (entries
2–5). Second, we wanted to compare the observed rate constant
in the excess of the aldehyde to that observed in the excess of the
nitroalkane.

Therefore, 1 mmol was used instead.

The reaction was
monitored using 1H NMR spectroscopy.
We used an automated sample changer of the spectrometer to monitor
all five reactions simultaneously. This limited the data collection
of each sample to ∼30 min intervals. Concentrations of the
substrates and the product were obtained from the integrals of the
proton signals relative to a catalyst signal (used as a standard)
and by normalizing it to the known catalyst concentration. The 1H NMR spectra of entries 1 and 4 are shown in Figures S7 and
S8, respectively (Supporting Information). We used a pseudo-first-order kinetics method to analyze the data.58 The initial rate constant, k″, were obtained by linear fitting of the beginning of each
trace. The analysis and the calculated conversions of the samples
are presented in Figure 6. The observed initial pseudo-first-order rate constants (entries
2–5) as a function of the catalyst loading are presented in Figure 7.

of the deviation from the linear trend, we fitted only the beginning
of each trace (3–5 data points). The samples and the reaction
conditions are listed in Table 1.

Figure 7 Observed initial pseudo-first-order rate constants
of entries 2–5
as a function of the catalyst loading.

The rate constants increase linearly upon increasing the
catalyst
loading demonstrating that the reaction is first-order in the catalyst
(Figure 7). All entries
exhibit deviation from the linear trend after reaching ∼60–80%
conversion. For entries 4 and 5, the deviation is noticeable already
after a few data points because of the slow sampling time relative
to the rate of the reaction. This is tentatively attributed to a catalyst
inhibition by the product. The hydroxyl group of the product is a
better hydrogen-bond donor than the substrates and can block the active
site of the catalyst. Because of the inhibition and slow sampling
time, we could not unambiguously determine the reaction order in the
substrate concentrations. Second, the NMR spectra showed that, in
the excess of the aldehyde (entry 1), the primary product reacted
with the aldehyde generating a dihydroxy side product which prevented
the comparison between the rate constants of entries 1 and 4.

To overcome the problems of the first kinetic study, EtNO2 and 4-CF3PhA were used as the reaction substrates. The
product of this reaction has a single α-hydrogen next to the
nitro group which is expected to suppress the side reaction between
the primary product and the aldehyde. In addition, concentrations
of the substrates were decreased to half of those in the first study
while maintaining the catalyst concentration to increase the accuracy
of the relative integration of the NMR signals. This effectively increases
the catalyst loading to 20 mol %. To compensate for the decreased
reaction rate because of the lower concentration of the substrates
(1/2 × 1/2 = 1/4), the temperature was raised to 40 °C.
As a rough approximation, increase of ∼20 °C is expected
to increase the rate by a factor of four.59 The reaction progress was monitored using 1H NMR with
increasing time intervals (1–20 min). The beginning of the reaction (0–15
min) was not sampled due to setting up of the measurement (locking
and shimming) and to stabilize the temperature. We used the reaction
progress kinetic analysis method60 to construct
the so-called graphical rate equations (rate as a function of concentration
of the substrate not in excess) as described in the Supporting Information. The reaction scheme and the samples
are presented in Table 2, and the graphical rate equations of the reactions are presented
in Figure 8.

The 1H NMR spectra of the entries of Table 2 are shown in Figures S9 and
S10, respectively (Supporting Information). Both reactions showed a clean conversion to the desired product
as a mixture of two diastereomers. The diastereomeric ratio was dr
= 1.3:1 as determined from the ratio of the proton signals. The absolute
configuration or the enantiomeric excess of the two diastereomers
was not investigated.

The rates of both reactions decrease linearly
upon decreasing the
substrate concentration. This demonstrates that the reaction is first
order in both of the reactants. The slight deviation at the end of
the reaction is most likely because of catalyst inhibition by the
product. Because of the identical conditions (same overall concentrations
and temperature) comparison of the rates is now possible. The reaction
performed in the excess of EtNO2 exhibits approximately five times higher rate than that performed
in the excess of 4-CF3PhA. This clearly demonstrates that the binding of the aldehyde inhibits
the reaction, and the binding mode presented in Scheme 2 does not play a role in the likely reaction
pathway. Binding of the aldehyde is additionally observed by comparing
the catalyst proton signals between the two reaction mixtures (Figure
S11, Supporting Information). Most of the
quinuclidine signals exhibit a significant downfield shift in the
excess of the aldehyde, similar to that observed in Figure 5. The much higher rate in the
excess of EtNO2 suggests that
the initial step is the deprotonation of the nitroalkane by the basic
quinuclidine, as proposed in the literature. According to computational
studies on related systems, deprotonated nitroalkane forms an ion–pair
complex with the protonated quinuclidine, which is stabilized by hydrogen-bonding
interactions (Scheme 3). Further on, the aldehyde can form hydrogen bonds to either the
protonated quinuclidine or the 6′-OH group to form the reactive
tertiary complex. The absolute configuration of the product is determined
by a subtle interplay between the hydrogen-bonding interactions between
the catalyst and the reaction substrates and the solvent.30,34,49,61

Basic Quinuclidine Moiety
Conclusions
We have used UV–vis and NMR spectroscopies
in combination
with the reaction kinetic analysis to study the binding modes and
reaction mechanism of an organocatalytic Henry reaction between nitroalkanes
and aldehydes. The reaction is catalyzed by the previously studied Cinchona alkaloid catalyst BnCPD. According
to the literature, the reaction proceeds via deprotonation of the
nitroalkane by the basic site of the catalyst followed by nucleophilic
attack to the aldehyde to form the product.

Addition of nitroalkanes
is found to result in the dynamic quenching
of the intrinsic fluorescence of the catalyst without clear evidence
of complex formation. The NMR measurements show a weak interaction
between the hydroxyl group of the catalyst and the nitroalkanes at
catalytic concentrations. Aldehydes, on the other hand, exhibit strong
interactions with both the hydroxyl group and the quinuclidine moiety
of the catalyst as evidenced by both the UV–vis and the NMR
measurements. The substrate forms a bridge between the two functional
groups of the catalyst. This type of a binding mode changes the conformational
distribution of the catalyst toward the closed conformation.

The reaction displays first-order kinetics with respect to the
catalyst and the substrates. A slight deviation from the first-order
kinetics at high conversions is attributed to a catalyst inhibition
by the product. The reaction proceeds approximately five times faster
in the excess of the nitroalkane than in the excess of the aldehyde
under identical reaction conditions. Therefore, binding of the aldehydes
to the active site of the catalyst results in the inhibition of the
reaction and does not play a role in the catalytic cycle.

Experimental
Section
Materials
BnCPD was synthesized according
to the procedure reported in the literature51 and subsequently purified twice by recrystallization from ethyl
acetate/petroleum ether. MeNO2 (ReagentPlus, ≥99%), nitroethane (ReagentPlus, ≥99.5%), BA (≥99.5%), benzaldehyde (≥99.5%), and 4-(trifluoromethyl)benzaldehyde
(98%) were from Sigma-Aldrich. 4-Nitrobenzaldehyde (98%) was from
Merck, and THF-d8 was from Euriso-Top. BA and 4-(trifluoromethyl)benzaldehyde were purified by distillation
and stored under nitrogen. Other chemicals were used without further
purification. THF was of spectroscopic grade, distilled from sodium
and benzophenone, stored over 4 Å molecular sieves, and handled
under nitrogen atmosphere.

Spectroscopic Measurements
Steady-state
absorption
and fluorescence spectra were recorded using a Shimadzu UV-2700 spectrophotometer
and a SPEX Fluorolog3-22 fluorimeter, respectively. The fluorescence
spectra were collected in a right-angled geometry and corrected for
the spectral sensitivity of the instrument. All measurements were
carried out at room temperature (21 ± 1 °C) using nondegassed
samples. The experimental setup for the measurements of the fluorescence
lifetimes (TCSPC) is described in the Supporting Information.
