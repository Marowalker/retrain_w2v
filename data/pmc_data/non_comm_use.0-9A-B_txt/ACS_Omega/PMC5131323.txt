Physical stability of synthetic skin
samples during their exposure
to microwave heating was investigated to demonstrate the use of the
metal-assisted and microwave-accelerated decrystallization (MAMAD)
technique for potential biomedical applications. In this
regard, optical microscopy and temperature measurements were employed
for the qualitative and quantitative assessment of damage to synthetic
skin samples during 20 s intermittent microwave heating using a monomode
microwave source (at 8 GHz, 2–20 W) up to 120 s. The
extent of damage to synthetic skin samples, assessed by the change
in the surface area of skin samples, was negligible for microwave
power of ≤7 W and more extensive damage (>50%) to skin samples
occurred when exposed to >7 W at initial temperature range of 20–39
°C. The initial temperature of synthetic skin samples significantly
affected the extent of change in temperature of synthetic skin samples
during their exposure to microwave heating. The proof of principle
use of the MAMAD technique was demonstrated for the decrystallization
of a model biological crystal (l-alanine) placed under synthetic
skin samples in the presence of gold nanoparticles. Our results showed
that the size (initial size ∼850 μm) of l-alanine
crystals can be reduced up to 60% in 120 s without damage to synthetic
skin samples using the MAMAD technique. Finite-difference time-domain-based
simulations of the electric field distribution of an 8 GHz monomode
microwave radiation showed that synthetic skin samples are predicted
to absorb ∼92.2% of the microwave radiation.

Introduction
Hyperuricemia, a precursor
for gout disease, is caused by elevated
serum levels of uric acid and results in the buildup of monosodium
urate monohydrate (MSUM) crystals in the soft tissue of humans. Normal
serum uric acid levels range from 3.5 to 7.2 mg/dL. Consistent levels
above the normal range result in acute gout, which gradually advances
into chronic gout.1−5 Chronic gout arises when MSUM crystals accumulate in the synovial
joints and the surrounding soft tissues to subsequently form aggregates,
also known as tophi.6 Current therapies
for gout include the systematic use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory
drugs (NSAIDs) as chemical therapeutics for inflammation and uricosuria
agents for the reduction of uric acid reuptake by the kidneys.7,8 NSAIDs and uricosuria agents have numerous systemic side effects,
such as stomach ulcers, decubitus ulcers, osteoporosis, and decreased
function of the immune system.9,10 For extreme cases of
chronic gout, surgery is often recommended for the removal of tophi
masses.11,12 The breach of the main barrier (skin tissue)
during invasive surgical removal of crystal aggregates often poses
a major risk of infection to the joints, destroying joints, resulting
in a need for amputation.13,14 Consequently, there
is still a need for alternative noninvasive therapies for the treatment
of gout.

Microwaves have been used as therapeutic and diagnostic
aids in
the field of medicine and surgery.15,16 The use of
microwaves in other aspects of biomedicine, such as in hyperthermia
therapy, inflammation therapy, and in the diagnosis and treatment
of cancer, is also on the rise.15−17 The efficiency of microwave heating
of tissue samples depends on the frequency of the microwaves and the
penetration depth of the waves through dielectric materials within
the skin.16,17 In this regard, microwaves with lower frequency
can penetrate deeper into the skin than the microwaves with higher
frequency.18,19 For example, microwave systems
operating at 915 MHz and 2.45 GHz are suited for large volume ablation,17 whereas the use of higher frequencies is suitable
for treatments such as skin cancer, ablation of heart tissue to treat
arrhythmia, uterine fibroids, multiple small liver metastases, corneal
ablation for vision correction, spinal nerve ablation to treat back
pain, varicose vein treatment, and verrucae treatment. Higher frequency
treatments in the range 5.8–10 GHz can create shallow penetration
of energy and are therefore ideal for near-surface-based treatments.
Microwave heating of skin causes molecular dipole rotation because
of the high water content as well as sweat ducts and underlying tissues.18,20 Furthermore, skin layers exhibit dielectric polarization when exposed
to microwaves.18,21 Skin layers are not as permeable
to microwaves as much as to conductors.22 Synovial joints and surrounding soft tissues have high fluid concentration
and dielectric properties. Subsequently, an appropriate level of microwave
power is needed to penetrate the joint and decrystallize embedded
crystal aggregates formed in gouty tophi.

The Aslan Research
Group recently described a technique known as
the metal-assisted and microwave-accelerated decrystallization (MAMAD)
technique, which is used to decrystallize crystals on the basis of
the combined use of microwaves and gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) in solution.23 In the MAMAD technique, kinetic energy of AuNPs
suspended in a buffer solution (at physiological pH) can be significantly
increased by microwave energy. Increased kinetic energy results in
increased collisions between the AuNPs in solution and the target
crystals are placed on a surface.12,23 Subsequently,
uric acid and other gout-related crystals on a surface can be decrystallized
by the combined use of AuNPs and microwave heating, that is, the MAMAD
technique.

In this study, we investigated the effect of microwave
heating
on a synthetic skin sample using a solid state, medical microwave
source at 8 GHz. The power level of the microwave and the duration
of the microwave heating were varied between 2 and 20 W and 0 and
120 s, respectively. Qualitative
and quantitative assessment of skin damage was carried out using optical
microscopy and real-time temperature measurements. Synthetic skin
samples were used to simulate the real human skin for future potential
applications of the MAMAD technique for the treatment of acute and
chronic gout. We also investigated whether the size of a large crystal
(l-alanine, a model crystal for tophi) placed under a synthetic
skin sample can be reduced in the presence of AuNPs (20 nm) using
the MAMAD technique. Finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulations
were carried out to predict the extent of interactions of 8 GHz monomode
microwave radiation with synthetic skin samples. In addition, change
in temperature of synthetic skin samples at an initial temperature
of 20 °C during 120 s of microwave heating was simulated and
compared with that of experimental temperature measurements.

Results
and Discussion
To establish a baseline for the quantification
of damage to synthetic
skin samples by medical microwaves, optical images of synthetic skin
samples before their exposure to microwave heating were obtained at
different temperatures (Figure S1, Supporting
Information). The temperature range of synthetic skin samples was
chosen to vary between physiological temperatures of 20 and 39 °C,
which is based on the future potential application of the MAMAD technique
in humans. Synthetic skin used in this study has a similar texture
and consistency to the actual human skin tissue as well as a similar
puncture pressure of 2 N/mm2 as compared to 2.5 ±
0.3 N/mm2 for human skin.24 We
note that toughness of the human skin depends on the structural collagen
network embedded in the tissues, the density of collagen fibers, the
location of the punctured skin (e.g., skin on the finger, back, or
leg), and the tools used to puncture the skin (sharp or blunt). As
each synthetic skin sample was prepared separately and a variation
in the initial temperature of samples before their exposure to microwave
results in a variation in the initial surface area of synthetic skin
samples as evidenced by upper and lower views of these samples, pictures
of all synthetic skin samples were taken in the beginning of the experiments
(Figure S1).

Real-color pictures
of synthetic skin samples at initial temperatures
of 20–39 °C before and after their exposure to 20 s intervals
of microwave heating (up to 120 s) using an 8 GHz, solid-state microwave
source at 2–20 W are used for qualitative and quantitative
assessment of skin damage and these results are given in Figures 1, 2, S2, and S10.

frames denote no tissue damage at 2 and 4 W. Red frames denote tissue
damage after 120 s of microwave heating at 5, 10, 15, and 20 W.

confirmation.
Real-color pictures of synthetic skin samples at body temperature
(assessed up to 120 s at initial temperature of 37 °C and t = 0 s) before and after their exposure to 20 s intervals
of microwave heating
at 2, 4, 5, 10, 15, and 20 W. Green frames denote no tissue damage
at 2 and 4 W. Red frames denote tissue damage after 120 s of microwave
heating at 5, 10, 15, and 20 W.

Our reasoning for the use of initial temperatures lower than
the
physiological temperature is to simulate conditions, where the potential
application of medical microwaves on inflamed joints can be tolerated
more comfortably by gout patients. Figure 1 shows the summary of the results for qualitative
assessment of damage to synthetic skin samples kept at an initial
temperature of 20 °C after 120 s of microwave heating at various
microwave power levels (2–20 W).

Visual inspection of
synthetic skin samples after 120 s of microwave
heating at a microwave power range of 2–4 W shows a negligible
change in the surface area of synthetic skin samples and water vapor
bubbles form around the skin samples. Further increase in the microwave
power level to higher than 5 W resulted in a significant change in
the surface area and formation of larger water vapor bubbles. In addition,
these experiments were repeated with synthetic skin samples kept at
different temperatures. For example, to simulate the physiological
temperature conditions in humans, synthetic skin samples at 37 °C
were exposed to 20 s intervals of microwave heating up to 120 s and
the summary of these results are shown in Figure 2. Visual inspection of synthetic skin samples
shows negligible skin damage for microwave power less than 4 W and
significant damage at microwave power levels of higher than 5 W. Similar
damage trends were also observed for the remainder of synthetic skin
samples studied (Figures S2 and S5).

It is important to explain the choice of time interval of 20 s
of microwave heating of the synthetic skin samples. Our previous25−28 and ongoing studies involving solid-state29 and conventional microwaves30 for the
decrystallization of organic and inorganic crystals31 show that 20 s of microwave heating time is optimum in
controlling the temperature changes in the medium with target crystals.23 As our ultimate aim is to potentially employ
the MAMAD technique for the decrystallization of gout-related crystals
in humans, precise control over temperature change is critically important
to minimize the damage to biological samples. In this regard, to investigate
the extent of damage to synthetic skin samples during 20 s intervals
of microwave heating, we have carried out a series of experiments
by capturing real-color pictures of both sides of synthetic skin samples
and measuring the temperature of the top layer of samples simultaneously
(our experimental setup restricted our ability to measure the temperature
of the bottom layer).

Real-color pictures of synthetic skin
samples at initial temperatures
of 20–39 °C before and after their exposure to 20 s intervals
of microwave heating (up to 120 s) were used for the quantitative
assessment of skin damage (Figures S6–S11). In this regard, the extent of change in the surface area of synthetic
skin samples was calculated using real-color pictures and ImageJ software
and results are shown in Figures 3 and 4. Upon exposure of synthetic
skin samples at 20 °C to microwave heating at 2–10 W,
the surface areas of the top and bottom layers of synthetic skin samples
show no significant change. On the other hand, the surface area of
synthetic skin samples at 20 °C appears to decrease significantly
when the microwave power is increased to higher than 10 W. As the
initial temperature of synthetic skin samples is increased to 25 and
30 °C, microwave heating of skin samples resulted in an increase
(∼50%) in the surface area of the top layers of the samples.
In addition, the surface area of the bottom layers of synthetic skin
samples also shows greater variability during microwave heating (Figure 3). The observed changes
can be explained by up to 12 °C increase in temperature of the
samples because of microwave heating (Figure 5) and partially by experimental error (synthetic
skin samples are relatively fragile when cut into small pieces and
force is applied by the microwave applicator). It is also important
to note that the evaporation of water within the layers of synthetic
skin samples because of microwave heating contributes to the change
in the surface area, where the evaporation of water generates air
pockets around and throughout the samples (the sample holder is sealed
and the escape of water vapor from the system is prevented). As the
extent of air pockets in the system is unknown and is included in
the overall calculation of the surface area, the standard deviation
values significantly vary for synthetic skin samples with extensive
water vapor formation after
their exposure to microwave heating.

Figure 3 Reduction of surface area of the synthetic
skin sample during microwave
heating (2–20 W) up to 120 s. Initial temperature of the synthetic
skin sample was adjusted to 20, 25, and 30 °C. An increase in
surface area (in %) denotes the physical expansion of the synthetic
skin sample and a decrease in the surface area indicates the physical
reduction of the synthetic skin sample.

Figure 4 Reduction of surface area of the synthetic skin sample during microwave
heating (2–20 W) up to 120 s. Initial temperature of the synthetic
skin sample was adjusted to 34, 37, and 39 °C. An increase in
surface area (in %) denotes the expansion of the synthetic skin sample
and a decrease in the slope indicates the reduction of the synthetic
skin sample.

Figure 5 Change in temperature
of the synthetic skin sample during microwave
heating to assess potential changes in surface area (2–20 W)
up to 120 s. Initial temperature of the synthetic skin sample was
adjusted to 20, 25, 30, 34, 37, and 39 °C. Room temperature was
∼25 °C at the time of experiments.

Figure 4 shows
that
the change in the surface area of the top layer of synthetic skin
samples at 34–39 °C is significantly less (up to 20% change)
during microwave heating as compared to that of synthetic skin samples
kept at temperatures lower than 30 °C. This observation can be
partially explained by a smaller increase in temperature (∼4
°C) of the samples kept at 34–39 °C (Figure 5). However, the
surface area of the bottom layer of synthetic skin samples at 34–39
°C varies up to 50% of its original value, which can be attributed
to a greater extent to the evaporation of water within synthetic skin
samples and the subsequent formation of vapor bubbles around and throughout
the samples.

As the MAMAD technique involves the use of microwave
heating, it
is important to measure and control the temperature of synthetic skin
samples to assess the potential contribution of the change in temperature
of samples to damage. Figure 5 shows the change in temperature of synthetic skin samples
kept at various initial temperatures during microwave heating (2–20
W). The largest change in temperature (ΔT =
5–12 °C) of synthetic skin samples after 120 s of microwave
heating was observed for those kept at an initial temperature of 20
°C. As the initial temperature of synthetic skin samples was
increased to 39 °C, the change in temperature was gradually decreased
to the range of 1–5 °C. These observations can be explained
by the multiple heat transfer events that occur during the microwave
heating of synthetic skin samples. As the temperature of the room
was 25 °C at the time of collection of the data presented here,
initial temperature of synthetic skin samples at 20 °C is cooler
than the room temperature and in an attempt to reach thermal equilibrium
the samples absorb heat from the surroundings. Combined with the application
of microwave heating to the samples for 120 s that provides an additional
source of heating for the samples, the temperature of the samples
was increased from 20 to ∼32 °C in 120 s. The increase
in temperature for synthetic skin samples already kept at 25 and 30
°C was up to the range of 2–9 °C, which in most part
can be attributed to the microwave heating. On the other hand, when
the initial temperature of synthetic skin samples (>34 °C)
is
significantly higher than room temperature (25 °C), the increase
in temperature is up to the range of 1–5 °C. In this regard,
as the initial temperature of synthetic skin samples is higher than
room temperature, in an attempt to reach thermal equilibrium, the
samples transfer heat to the surroundings (i.e., cooling). However,
synthetic skin samples are exposed to microwave heating and the overall
effect of both cooling and microwave heating is an increase in the
temperature. These results imply that the initial temperatures of
the samples and the surroundings play an important role in the overall
temperature change of the samples: microwave heating (20 s intervals,
120 s total heating time) of synthetic skin samples results in up
to 9 °C increase in temperature for samples kept at 25 °C,
and an additional ∼3 °C increase in temperature for samples
kept at 20 °C and a decrease of ∼3 °C for samples
kept at >34 °C.

On the basis of the observations described
above, quantitative
assessment of skin damage with respect to microwave heating can be
summarized in Figure 6. According to our results, synthetic skin samples kept at an initial
temperature range of 20–39 °C can safely be exposed up
to 4 W of microwave heating (8 GHz) for up to 120 s without structural
damage (green zone, Figure 6). Synthetic skin samples can also tolerate exposure to increased
microwave power up to 7 W for additional 20–120 s, where a
50% loss of physical stability can be expected (orange zone, Figure 6). However, because
of the loss of physical stability of synthetic skin samples, the use
of microwave power higher than 7 W is not recommended (red zone).

assessment of skin damage with respect to microwave
heating time. Green scale denotes the time and microwave power where
no tissue damage was observed in the synthetic skin sample (note that
the initial temperature of the synthetic skin sample was adjusted
to the values given in y axis). “Glowing”

damage was observed. Red scale denotes significant tissue damage.
Time values indicate the duration of microwave heating where synthetic
skin samples remain undamaged.

To investigate the extent of interactions of monomode microwaves
at 8 GHz with synthetic skin samples placed in iCrystal plates, two
predictive simulation tools based on FDTD calculations of temperature
and electric field distributions were employed (Figures 7 and S13). Figure 7 shows the temperature
and electric field distributions across the virtual model generated
for synthetic skin sample and the iCrystal plate predicted by COMSOL
software. Theoretical calculations predict a variation in the temperature
throughout the synthetic skin sample (Figure 7): for microwave heating at 10 W, the temperature
of the top portion of the synthetic skin sample is predicted to increase
from an initial temperature of 20 to 30 °C in 120 s, which is
comparable to that of the actual temperature measurement provided
in Figure 5. The temperature
of the middle portion of the synthetic skin sample is predicted to
increase similar to that of the top portion; however, the temperature
of the bottom portion of the synthetic skin sample is predicted to
increase from an initial temperature of 20 to 38 °C in 120 s,
which can be attributed to the higher temperature of the iCrystal
plate. As microwave heating progresses, poly(methyl methacrylate)
(PMMA) (bottom part of the iCrystal plate) heats up more quickly as
compared to synthetic skin sample and subsequently heat transfer from
PMMA to synthetic skin sample results in an increase in the temperature
of the bottom portion of the synthetic skin sample that accounts for
the predicted variations in the temperature throughout synthetic skin
samples.

Figure 7 COMSOL simulations of temperature and electric field distributions
for an 8 GHz microwave source in a waveguide with synthetic skin samples
placed on between a cover slip and iCrystal plates. Microwave power
input = 10 W, t = 120 s.

It is important to note that the initial temperature of the
system
was set to 20 °C and additional heat transfer from the surroundings
(room temperature = 25 °C) to the system was not considered in
these predictive calculations. As the current simulation model created
in COMSOL is not capable of calculating all possible heat transfer
events that occur during microwave heating of synthetic skin samples
on the iCrystal plates, no additional calculations were carried out
for other experimental conditions reported in this study. Further
studies are underway and will be reported in due course.

In
addition to COMSOL simulations, an open-source FDTD-based simulation
tool to predict the extent of absorption of electromagnetic energy
by synthetic skin samples was used. In this regard, transmission (T)
and reflection (R) spectra were recorded at a single frequency of
8 GHz by placing detectors at the bottom and top parts of the simulation
cell, respectively (Figure S13). The absorption
(A) percentage was calculated with A = 1 – (T + R) by using
the simulated values. Simulation results show that the electric field
is predicted to propagate through synthetic skin samples, where the
monomode microwave radiation intensity is significantly reduced by
the samples. The transmission and reflection spectra simulations showed
that the three-layer structure (synthetic skin, cover slip, and the
iCrystal plate) absorbed ∼92.2% of the 8 GHz monomode microwave
radiation, where ∼5.2% was transmitted and ∼2.6% was
reflected back into the source. Separate simulations showed that the
cover slip and the iCrystal plates had negligible absorption under
8 GHz microwave radiation. These predictions imply that the synthetic
skin sample can be effectively heated within 2 min, which is corroborated
by experimental temperature measurements.

Figure 8A shows
the proof-of-principle demonstration of the MAMAD technique for decrystallization
of l-alanine (model tophi for advanced gout) through synthetic
skin sample in the presence of AuNPs. In this regard, l-alanine
crystals and a solution of AuNPs (20 nm in diameter) were placed at
the bottom of an iCrystal plate and covered with synthetic skin sample
and exposed to 5 and 10 W of microwave heating for up to 120 s with
20 s intervals. We note that the choice of 10 W is on the basis of
the following thought process: it is hypothesized that the presence
of AuNPs near the synthetic skin sample can extend the durability
of the synthetic skin sample to microwave heating above the <7
W microwave power threshold for minimal damage to skin. In this regard,
to demonstrate the significance of combined use of microwaves and
AuNPs, three control experiments were carried out: (1) control experiment
1 = solution of AuNPs is omitted (no AuNP) and 5 W microwave heating
is applied, (2) control experiment 2 = AuNP present, no microwave
heating, and (3) control experiment 3 = no AuNP, no microwave heating.
In the first control experiment, where the solution of AuNPs is omitted,
microwave heating of l-alanine crystals resulted in 11% reduction
in size. This observation implies that microwave-accelerated decrystallization
of crystals can be achieved. Moreover, when microwave heating is omitted
and only AuNPs are used (metal-assisted decrystallization), the size
of l-alanine crystals can be reduced up to 8%. In addition,
the contribution of dissolution of l-alanine crystals at
room temperature without AuNPs was found to be 3% (control experiment
3). When the MAMAD technique (i.e., combined use of AuNPs and microwave
heating) is applied, the size of the l-alanine crystal was
reduced 26 and 60% in the samples with AuNPs exposed to 5 and 10 W
of microwave heating, respectively. An increase in microwave power
from 5 to 10 W clearly increases the extent of decrystallization of l-alanine. A closer inspection of synthetic skin samples exposed
to 10 W of microwave power in the presence of AuNPs reveals negligible
damage, as opposed to significant skin damage observed without AuNPs
as shown in Figure 7 and as described earlier in the text. To investigate the effect
of the presence of AuNPs near synthetic samples during microwave heating,
the temperature of synthetic skin samples kept at 20 °C was monitored
in the absence and presence of AuNPs and l-alanine crystals
during 120 s of microwave heating at 5 and 10 W (Figure S12). These measurements reveal that the temperature
of the synthetic skin sample with AuNPs (labeled as 10 W with Au)
remained ∼1 °C cooler than that of the synthetic skin
sample without AuNPs, which can directly be attributed to the presence
of AuNPs and l-alanine crystals and can explain the observed
negligible damage to synthetic skin sample exposed to 10 W of microwave
power.

demonstration of the MAMAD technique for the potential treatment of
advanced gout using l-alanine as model tophi, synthetic skin

MAMAD technique with AuNPs. Synthetic skin samples were kept at 37
°C. (B) Potential future application of the MAMAD technique for
the treatment of gout at various stages of the diseases by medical

On the basis of these
initial observations, our laboratory is currently
working on furthering the applicability of the MAMAD technique by
additional experiments using AuNPs of various sizes, where gout-related
crystals are decrystallized in exact polymeric replicas of human bones
prepared using a commercially available 3-D printer and synthetic
skin (Figure 8A). These
observations imply that the MAMAD technique can be potentially used
for decrystallization of crystalline materials related to gout disease
through human skin in the future (Figure 8B).

Preparation
of the Synthetic Skin
Synthetic skin used for experiments
represented the skin of a Caucasian adult and consisted of bonded
and nonbonded synthetic polymers, characteristic of the epidermis,
dermis, subcutaneous, and muscle layers of the skin (Figure 9). The bonded epidermis and
dermis layers’ tissue plate samples were measured to be 2 mm
thick. The subcutaneous fat layer and the muscle layer tissue plates
were nonbonded layers; these sections were measured to be 5 and 2
mm thick, respectively. The subcutaneous layers were adjusted to 2
mm for a total synthetic skin thickness of 6 mm. Synthetic skin (as
purchased) is 2 mm thicker than human skin tissue at actual tophi
site, which is approximately 2–4 mm in thickness.

Figure 9 Schematic illustration
of our experimental process. Synthetic skin
samples (at initial temperature range 20–39 °C) are subjected
to specified microwave power levels. Real-color pictures of synthetic
skin samples (bottom and top sides) are captured to visually and quantitatively
assess the damage because of microwave energy. Real-color, high-resolution
picture of the synthetic skin construct and its individual components
are shown.

The thickness of the synthetic
skin was adjusted with the use of
a surgical knife until it measured 1.5–2 mm and was made comparable
to that of human skin layers. Bonding of the three synthetic skin
tissue plates was done with the use of a cyanoacrylate glue to form
a model that represented all skin components. Synthetic skin samples
were sectioned into 4.5 mm (width) × 6 mm (height) pieces and
immersed into an antialgae solution. Synthetic skin samples were then
stored in sealed 20 mL scintillation vials and refrigerated at 4 °C
to prevent contamination and to maintain the integrity of the synthetic
skin samples. Subsequently, synthetic skin samples were processed
under a laminar flow hood to prevent contamination and stored in an
incubator before use. An ice bath and an incubator were used to adjust
the initial temperature of synthetic skin samples between the range
of 20 and 39 °C.

An 8 GHz compact microwave generator with
a maximum variable power
of 20 W was used to test the physical stability of synthetic skin
samples. The wavelength of 8 GHz microwaves is ∼3.75 cm and
microwaves are expected to completely penetrate (minus the absorption
of microwaves by the skin) the depth of synthetic skin samples used
in this study. Upon completion of the test on synthetic skin, the
MAMAD technique was applied with the use of AuNPs and l-alanine
as a model crystal. All samples were analyzed under a digital microscope.
Further experimental details are provided in the following sections.

Microwave Heating of the Synthetic Skin
Synthetic skin
samples were placed in the sample holders of an iCrystal plate (Figure 9, each well is 4.5
mm in diameter and 6 mm in depth) and monitored with a microscope
during microwave heating. A glass cover slip was placed over the synthetic
skin during microwave heating. The real-color pictures of synthetic
skin samples (bottom and top views) were captured before and after
microwave heating. Synthetic skin samples were exposed to microwaves
(2–20 W using the following increments: 2, 4, 5, 10, 15, and
20 W) for 20 s and up to 120 s. The initial temperature of the synthetic
skin samples ranged from 20 to 39 °C (20, 25, 30, 34, 37, and
39 °C) to simulate future potential applications of the MAMAD
technique in humans. The captured real-color pictures of synthetic
skin samples (top and bottom surfaces) were used to quantify and assess
the progression of the microwave-induced damage to synthetic skin
samples. An infrared thermometer was used to measure the temperature
of the top layer of synthetic skin that was exposed directly to the
microwave heating. As microwaves were applied, the bottom of the sample
was monitored with another digital video camera. The digital images
of synthetic skin samples were examined for changes observable with
naked eye. In addition,
in control experiments, synthetic skin samples were kept at temperatures
ranging from 20 to 39 °C without microwave heating. Changes in
the surface area of all synthetic skin samples were quantified using
ImageJ software.

Decrystallization of l-Alanine Using
the MAMAD Technique
l-Alanine crystals (a surface
area of approximately 4
mm2) were used as a model for large crystal mass (tophi)
associated with gout. Synthetic skin samples were placed in the well
of an iCrystal plate with l-alanine crystals and solution
of 20 nm AuNPs. In control experiments, AuNPs were omitted from the
samples as described above. Microwave power levels for the decrystallization
experiments were chosen on the basis of the extent of damage sustained
by synthetic skin samples and the range of increase in temperature
(up to 12 °C but less than 41 °C) as observed from the experiments
described in the previous section. Both samples were exposed to 8
GHz microwave power at 7 W for a total of 120 s and monitored with
an optical microscope. All experiments in this study were repeated
a minimum of three times and the average of the data with standard
deviation was reported.

COMSOL Theoretical Simulations
COMSOL
Multiphysics
software (version 5.2) includes an in-built microwave heating model
for a conventional microwave oven, which was modified to simulate
electric field and temperature distributions of 8 GHz (monomode microwave
source) across a model structure generated for synthetic skin and
an iCrystal plate. Synthetic skin (surroundings: air and silicone
isolators) and iCrystal plates were used as a target sample for microwave
heating at 10 W. We note one can study any microwave power in simulations.
We have chosen 10 W microwave power as an example. Calculations related
to microwave heating are described by Maxwell’s equations and
have been previously published.32−34 A frequency transient study with
a time-dependent solver (20 s steps up to 120 s) was conducted for
the whole system rather than for a symmetric half. The FDTD method
was used in computation of equations in COMSOL Multiphysics software.
Heat transfer study module of COMSOL Multiphysics software is also
used to predict the heat distribution across wells during microwave
heating steps.

FDTD Studies
Additional FDTD simulations
were performed
to determine the percentage of microwave absorption by the skin sample.
Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s (MIT) open-source MIT
Electromagnetic Equation Propagation (MEEP) FDTD software35 was utilized for the two-dimensional (2-D) transmission,
reflection, and electric field visualization simulations. In the electric
field visualization simulations, a virtual three-layer structure (4.5
mm wide) composed of a synthetic skin (6 mm thick), a 100 μm
thick borosilicate glass cover slip, and a 2 mm thick iCrystal plate,
where the skin was modeled according to dielectric properties of human
skin.36 In addition, an 8 GHz monomode
microwave radiation was modeled as a fixed frequency continuous source
located on the top part of the simulation cell. The simulation cell
was padded with 1 mm thick perfectly matched absorbing layers (i.e.,
silicone isolators). In the experiments, the microwave source is directed
to the skin sample via a flexible waveguide. Thus, the 8 GHz (full
wavelength = 3.75 cm) source was placed in a 4.5 mm wide waveguide
with a dielectric constant value of 17.3. The corresponding wavelength
of the microwave radiation in the waveguide is 9 mm, which ensures
monomode propagation throughout the constructed structure.

Conclusions
The effect of microwave heating of a synthetic skin sample using
a solid-state medical microwave source (8 GHz and 2–20 W power)
was investigated. Synthetic skin samples kept at 20–39 °C
were heated at 20 s intervals up to 120 s. Qualitative assessment
of skin damage carried out using optical microscopy showed that microwave
heating of synthetic skin sample causes negligible damage for microwave
power up to 7 W and significant damage at microwave power >7 W,
on
the basis of the summary provided in Figure 7. Optical microscope images of synthetic
skin samples were also processed using ImageJ software to calculate
the change in the surface area during microwave heating for the quantitative
assessment of skin damage. The extent of damage to synthetic skin
samples was negligible for microwave power <7 W and more extensive
damage (>50%) to synthetic skin samples occurred when exposed to
>7
W microwave heating. The observed damage to synthetic skin samples
was attributed to the evaporation of water within the layers of synthetic
skin samples because of microwave heating, which contributes to the
change in the surface area because of the generated air pockets around
and throughout the samples. In addition, the initial temperature of
synthetic skin samples before exposure to microwave heating was found
to affect the extent of change in temperature of the skin samples
during microwave heating. Although a 12 °C increase in temperature
for synthetic skin samples kept at an initial temperature of 20 °C
was observed, the change in temperature was significantly less (5
°C) for synthetic skin samples kept at higher initial temperatures
>34 °C after 120 s of microwave heating. The proof of principle
of the decrystallization of l-alanine crystals (a model crystal
for tophi) through synthetic skin samples using the MAMAD technique
was also demonstrated. Using the MAMAD technique, the size of l-alanine crystals placed under a synthetic skin sample can
be reduced up to 60%, which can be directly attributed to the combined
use of AuNPs and microwave heating. Theoretical calculations of electric
field distributions of a monomode microwave source at 8 GHz show that
electric field is predicted to propagate through synthetic skin samples
and monomode microwave radiation intensity is significantly reduced
by the structure.
