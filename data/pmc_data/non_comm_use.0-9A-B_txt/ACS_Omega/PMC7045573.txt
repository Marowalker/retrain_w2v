We report a thermoresponsive double
hydrophilic block copolymer
degradable in response to dual reduction and acidic pH at dual locations.
The copolymer consists of a poly(ethylene oxide) block covalently
connected through an acid-labile acetal linkage with a thermoresponsive
polymethacrylate block containing pendant oligo(ethylene oxide) and
disulfide groups. The copolymer undergoes temperature-driven self-assembly
in water to form nanoassemblies with acetal linkages at the core/corona
interface and disulfide pendants in the core, exhibiting dual reduction/acid
responses at dual locations. The physically assembled nanoaggregates
are converted to disulfide-core-crosslinked nanogels through disulfide–thiol
exchange reaction, retaining enhanced colloidal stability, yet degraded
to water-soluble unimers upon reduction/acid-responsive degradation.
Further, the copolymer exhibits improved tunability of thermoresponsive
property upon the cleavage of junction acetal and pendant disulfide
linkages individually and in combined manner. This work suggests that
dual location dual reduction/acid-responsive degradation is a versatile
strategy toward effective drug delivery exhibiting disulfide-core-crosslinking
capability and disassembly as well as improved thermoresponsive tunability.

Introduction
Amphiphilic block copolymers
(ABPs) have been extensively explored
as building blocks in the development of polymer-based drug delivery
systems.1−4 Well-defined ABPs consist of a hydrophobic block covalently conjugated
with a hydrophilic block, typically poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG). Because
of their amphiphilicity, they undergo self-assembly in aqueous solution
to form nanoassemblies with hydrophobic cores, capable of encapsulating
bioactive molecules. The integration of cleavable covalent linkages
to facilitate stimuli-responsive degradation through chemical transition
enhances the release of encapsulated bioactive molecules.5−11 Among chemical and physical stimuli, reduction12−15 and acidic pH18,19 are found in biological systems for attaining biodegradation. Typically,
tumor microenvironments have an elevated concentration of cellular
glutathione (a tripeptide)16 and are slightly
acidic (pH = 6.5–6.9).17 Even more
acidic environments (pH = 4.5–5.5) can be found in endosomes
and lysosomes. Reduction-responsive degradable nanoassemblies have
been developed by incorporating disulfide bonds as a pendant chain
in the hydrophobic block of ABPs, facilitating the formation of core-degradable
nanoassemblies.18−22 This approach is promising because the physically associated nanoassemblies
can be converted to the corresponding disulfide-core-crosslinked nanogels
through disulfide–thiol exchange reaction, providing improved
colloidal stability.23−25 These disulfide pendants and cross-links can be reduced
to their corresponding thiol (−SH) forms only in the presence
of cellular glutathione. This reductive degradation process can result
in the change of hydrophobic/hydrophilic balance, causing disintegration
of the nanoassemblies, leading to enhanced release of encapsulated
bioactive molecules. However, while the degraded products are labeled
with a hydrophilic functional group, it is not sufficient to render
the pendant chain water-soluble; thus, they tend to form large aggregates.
This presents a critical challenge in the removal from the body after
action, which may stem from the hydrophobic nature of ABPs.

Double hydrophilic block copolymer (DHBC) is a class of the block
copolymers composed of both water-soluble and hydrophilic blocks.26,27 Particularly, a thermoresponsive DHBC designed with a thermoresponsive
block exhibits a switchable amphiphilic nature upon a change in temperature.
Poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) and poly(oligo(ethylene
oxide) monomethyl ether methacrylate) are commonly used thermoresponsive
polymers. These thermoresponsive blocks can undergo a transition from
a hydrophilic to hydrophobic state above a specified temperature,
whereas another hydrophilic block composed of mainly PEG remains water-soluble.
Through the unique temperature response, thermoresponsive DHBCs self-assemble
to form nanoaggregates at temperatures above its lower critical solution
temperature (LCST). Their LCST can be adjusted with the change in
molecular weight and degree of hydrophobicity of thermoresponsive
blocks.28,29 These features have made thermoresponsive
DHBCs useful as effective building blocks for in situ gelation,30,31 sensing,32,33 catalysis,34 cellular imaging,35,36 and delivery.37−39 However, the physically assembled nanoaggregates are dissociated
to unimers when the temperature decreases below LCST. Such instability
in aqueous solution against heating remains challenging.

An
effective strategy to achieve enhanced colloidal stability is
the integration of cross-linking chemistry in the design of thermoresponsive
DHBCs, leading to the synthesis of cross-linked nanogels. The use
of labile cross-links such as disulfide linkages offers further reduction-responsive
disassembly of the formed bioreducible nanogels. Reports describe
the fabrication of bioreducible nanogels cross-linked with disulfide
cross-links through the incorporation of disulfide-bearing cross-linkers.40−42 As an example, a thermoresponsive PEG-based block copolymer consisting
of poly(NIPAM-co-N-acryloxysuccinimide)
was synthesized. Cystamine was used as an external cross-linker bearing
a disulfide to achieve disulfide core-crosslinking through facile
coupling reaction.43 Further, few reports
describe the synthesis of bioreducible nanogels through disulfide–thiol
exchange reaction of a thermoresponsive polymethacrylate bearing pendant
disulfide linkages.44 However, most of
the reported bioreducible systems exhibit single stimulus-responsive
disassembly in response to reduction. In this context, the exploration
of novel strategies to incorporate acid-labile linkage to core/corona
interfaces is highly desired to develop novel bioreducible nanogels
exhibiting dual reduction/acid responses in dual locations (cores
and interfaces) for precise control over assembly/disassembly as well
as thermoresponsiveness.

In this work, we have developed a strategy
utilizing atom transfer
radical polymerization (ATRP) to synthesize a thermoresponsive DHBC
degradable in response to dual reduction/acid stimuli. The block copolymer
consists of the PEG block connected through an acid-labile acetal
linkage with a thermoresponsive methacrylate-based random copolymer
block containing pendant oligo(ethylene oxide) and disulfide moieties,
thus forming PEG-acetal-P(OEOMA-co-HMssEt) (PKM)
(HMssEt; a methacrylate having a pendant disulfide linkage). The formed
PKM copolymer exhibits the tunable thermoresponsive properties with
varying densities of hydrophobic HMssEt units in the thermoresponsive
block. Temperature-driven self-assembly and following interchain disulfide–thiol
exchange reaction allow for the fabrication of disulfide-core-crosslinked
bioreducible nanogels with acetal linkages at core/corona interfaces,
attaining dual reduction/acid responses at dual locations. The formed
nanogels were characterized for dual acid/reduction-responsive disassembly
as well as in vitro cell viability and cellular uptake toward potential
for drug delivery. Further, the versatility of dual reduction/acid-responsive
degradation was studied for the tunability of LCST for the copolymer.

Results
and Discussion
Synthesis of Copolymers and Kinetics Investigation
Our experiments began with the synthesis of an acetal-labeled macroinitiator
of PEG-ac-Br. As depicted in Figure 1a, the first step was the synthesis of a vinyl ether
bromide (VE-Br) by a facile esterification of ethylene glycol vinyl
ether with α-bromoisobutyryl bromide at 90% yield as described
elsewhere.45 Its chemical structure was
confirmed by 1H NMR analysis (Figure 1b). The next step was the acetal formation
through the reaction of the formed VE-Br (30 mol equivalent excess)
with PEG in the presence of pyridinium p-toluenesulfonate
(PPTS) catalyst, followed by purification from diethyl ether. The 1H NMR spectrum in Figure 1b shows the presence of PEG moieties at 4.0–3.2
ppm (g and EOs), bromoisobutyryl group at 1.9 ppm (a), and acetal
moieties at 1.4 ppm (d′), confirming the synthesis of well-defined
PEG-ac-Br at 84% yield.

in CDCl3 of PEG-ac-Br and VE-Br precursor (b). Note that
x denotes
impurities and residual solvents.

After successful synthesis and characterization, the formed PEG-ac-Br
was used as a macroinitiator for ATRP of a mixture of HMssEt (a methacrylate
having a pendant disulfide) with oligo(ethylene oxide) monomethyl
ether methacrylate (OEOMA). As illustrated in Figure 2a, the activators rgenerated by Electron
Transfer (ARGET) process46,47 for ATRP was examined
with a CuBr2/tris(2-pyridylmethyl)amine (TPMA) complex
and tin(II) 2-ethylhexanoate (Sn(II)(EH)2) reducing agent
in anisole at 40 °C. With an initial mole ratio of [OEOMA + HMssEt]0/[PEG-ac-Br]0 = 70/1, projecting the degree of
polymerization (DP) to be 70 at complete monomer conversion, the amounts
of HMssEt in the feed were varied to synthesize a series of block
copolymers with different densities of disulfide pendants between
0 and 30 mol %.

Figure 2 Scheme illustration utilizing ARGET ATRP to synthesize
PKM copolymers
(a) and 1H NMR spectrum in CDCl3 of PKM-30 as
an example (b).

Polymerization was stopped to
reach monomer conversions within
the range of 55–70%. The formed copolymers were purified by
precipitation from hexane to remove residual monomers and passed through
basic aluminum oxide to remove residual metal species. Then, the purified,
dried copolymers were characterized to confirm their chemical structures
and measure their molecular weight. As an example, for PKM-30 containing
30 mol % disulfide pendants, 1H NMR in Figure 2b shows the characteristic
peaks corresponding to methyl groups on backbones between 0.8 and
1.2 ppm (a, a′) and pendant methoxy groups of OEOMA units at
3.3–3.8 ppm (EO) as well as methylene groups adjacent to disulfide
groups in HMssEt units at 2.9 ppm (h, i). Using their integrals, the
mol % of HMssEt units in the formed PKM-30 was estimated to be 33.
In a similar way, the HMssEt mol % for other copolymers was estimated.
Gel permeation chromatography (GPC) was used to determine molecular
weight of the purified, dried copolymers (Figure S1). They had the number average molecular weight (Mn) = 23–27 kg/mol with narrow dispersity
as D̵ < 1.3. These results are summarized
in Table 1.

To investigate
the kinetics of ARGET ATRP for a mixture of HMssEt
and OEOMA in the presence of PEG-ac-Br, aliquots were taken during
PKM-30 polymerization to determine monomer conversion and molecular
weights. As seen in Figure S2, the polymerization
was first-order with constant concentration of active radicals, molecular
weight increased linearly with conversion, and dispersity remained
low (D̵ < 1.2). Further, molecular weight
distribution evolved to high molecular region over conversion. These
results suggest that ARGET ATRP of HMssEt and OEOMA in the presence
of PEG-ac-Br is well-controlled.

Investigation of Thermoresponsive
and Solution Properties
The thermoresponsive properties of
the formed double-hydrophilic
block copolymers were examined using dynamic light scattering (DLS)
for aqueous solutions of PKM copolymers dissolved in phosphate buffer
saline (PBS) solution at pH = 7.4 at 0.1 wt %. As seen in Figure 3, the normalized
light scattering intensity remained low at lower temperatures, which
is attributed to the existence of copolymers as unimers in aqueous
solution. Upon an increase in temperature, the intensity abruptly
increased, which is attributed to the aggregation of polymeric chains
through the change in their polarity. Such change in hydrophilic/hydrophobic
balance confirms that the formed double hydrophilic copolymers are
thermoresponsive. The LCST is defined as the temperature at which
the normalized light scattering intensity starts to drastically decrease
with an increasing amount of hydrophobic HMssEt units in the polymethacrylate
block. For example, the LCST was 76.1 °C for PKM-0 with no HMssEt
units but decreased to 61.8 °C with 10 mol % hydrophobic HMssEt
units for PKM-10 and further to 40.3 °C with 30 mol % HMssEt
units for PKM-30.

Figure 3 Normalized count rate by DLS for PKM-0, PKM-10, and PKM-30
in aqueous
solution over temperature.

Given that PKM-30 has its LCST at 40 °C, close to the body
temperature, the copolymer was chosen to demonstrate a temperature-driven
assembly and disassembly via DLS. An aliquot of PKM-30 dissolved in
PBS (pH = 7.4) at 0.3% wt was subjected to a cyclic change between
10 and 60 °C, a temperature below and above its LCST, respectively.
The DLS diagrams of size distributions by volume in Figure 4 and by intensity in Figure S3 are shown. At 10 °C below its
LCST, the intensity distribution shows the coexistence of two components;
however, the volume distribution indicates the existence of most copolymer
chains as unimers48 with the average hydrodynamic
diameter to be 9 nm. When temperature increased to 60 °C above
its LCST, both intensity and volume distribution show one population
with the diameter by volume to 46 nm. Such an increase in the diameter
could be attributed to temperature-driven aggregation. Because of
physical association of the copolymer chains, the formed aggregates
turned to unimers when the temperature decreased to 10 °C. Such
a reversible temperature response is further demonstrated through
repeated heating–cooling cycles at 60 and 10 °C.

self-assembly/disassembly of PKM-30.

Investigation of Acid/Reduction-Responsive Degradation
The
copolymers are labeled with pendant disulfide linkages in the
polymethacrylate block and an acetal linkage at the block junction.
The cleavage of these labile linkages in response to acid and reduction
stimuli was investigated with PKM-30 fully dissolved in dimethylformamide
(DMF). Figure 5a shows
the schematic illustration of single acid or reduction response and
dual responses of PKM copolymer to acidic pH/reduction stimuli. GPC
was mainly used to follow the degradation (Figure 5b). When being incubated with acid (HCl),
PKM-30 degraded to PEG-OH, acetaldehyde, and PKM-OH upon the cleavage
of the acetal cleavages at block junctions. GPC analysis confirms
the decrease in molecular weight to Mn = 17.7 kg/mol from Mn = 27.2 kg/mol,
and the shift of GPC trace to lower molecular region between PKM-30
and PEG-ac-Br (macroinitiator). A shoulder in lower molecular weight
region corresponds to that of PEG-ac-Br macroinitiator, confirming
the generation of PEG-OH as a degraded product. Upon exposure to the
reducing agent dl-dithiothreitol (DTT) (5 mol equivalent),
the disulfide pendants in the polymethacrylate block could be cleaved,
generating PKM-SH as a possible degraded macromolecular product. Its
molecular weight slightly decreased from 27.2 kg mol–1 (D̵ = 1.1) to 20.3 kg mol–1 (D̵ = 1.3), confirming reductive cleavage
of significant densities of pendant disulfide linkages. In the presence
of DTT at acidic pH (dual stimuli), GPC analysis shows the decrease
in molecular weight to 16.1 kg/mol and the shift of molecular weight
distribution to low molecular region between PKM-30 and PEG-ac-Br.
Such a decrease in the molecular weight could be attributed to the
generation of PEG-OH and PKM-OH-SH as degraded macromolecular products
upon the cleavage of junction acetal and pendant disulfide linkages.

In Situ-Disulfide-Core-Crosslinking and Dual
Acid/Reduction-Degradable
Disassembly
The nanoaggregates formed at the temperature
above LCST by temperature-driven self-assembly in aqueous solutions
consist of P(OEOMA-co-HMssEt) cores surrounded with
PEG coronas. They, however, could be dissociated to the corresponding
unimers upon a decrease in temperatures below LCST. To enhance colloidal
stability at room temperature, the pendant disulfide linkages in PKM-based
cores could be utilized to cross-link the nanoaggregates through disulfide–thiol
exchange reactions in the presence of a catalytic amount of reducing
agent, yielding the corresponding nanogels cross-linked with new disulfide
linkages. This process, called in situ-disulfide core-crosslinking,
was examined by incubation of nanoaggregates with a catalytic amount
of DTT (0.2 mol equivalent) at 60 °C for 12 h. After being cooled
to room temperature, the formed products were analyzed by DLS and
transmission electron microscopy (TEM) techniques. The DLS diagram
shows the diameter by volume = 50 nm (Figure 5a), which is somewhat larger than that (46
nm) of uncrosslinked counterparts measured at 60 °C. Note that
the diameter was 9 nm for uncrosslinked nanoaggregates measured at
10 °C (see Figure 4). TEM analysis confirms the diameter = 16.3 ± 4.3 nm, which
is smaller than that determined by DLS (Figure 5a inset). This is attributed to the dehydrated
state of nanogels on TEM grids as well as the consequence of cross-linking.
Further, the diameter remained unchanged upon 1000-fold dilution in
PBS (Figure 6b). These
combined results suggest the occurrence of in situ disulfide-core-crosslinking
with enhanced colloidal stability.

scale bar = 100 nm for
in situ-disulfide core-crosslinked nanogels of PKM-30 before (a) and
after (b) 1000-fold dilution with PBS (b); DLS diagram by volume (c)
and schematic illustration (d) upon incubation with 10 mM DTT at acidic
pH.

As illustrated in Figure 6d, the formed disulfide-core-crosslinked
nanogels are labeled
with an acetal linkages at the interfaces and disulfide pendants and
cross-links in the cross-linked cores. These linkages could be cleaved
in response to both acid and reduction, resulting in the degradation
of the nanogels in aqueous solution. To investigate dual acid/reduction-responsive
degradation, the nanogels were incubated with 10 mM DTT at acidic
pH = 4.5. As seen in Figure 6c, the diameter significantly decreased to 5 nm after 1 h.
Such rapid degradation could be a consequence of both reductive cleavage
of disulfides and acid-cleavage of acetal linkages. The detected species,
likely the fully degraded product PKM-OH-SH, appears to be fully water-soluble
and together with its smaller size. This result could be promising
to facilitate the excretion of the degraded products from body.

To further investigate the degradation to single response, the
nanogels were incubated in acidic pH and DTT separately. Summarized
in Figure S4, the diameter increased to
>250 nm in an acidic environment, which could be attributed to
the
possible aggregation of disulfide-crosslinked cores upon the detachment
of PEG coronas. When the nanogels were incubated with 10 mM DTT, their
diameter significantly decreased to 7 nm after 24 h as a consequence
of the reductive degradation to yield PKM-SH, which could be also
dissolved in water.

Biological Evaluation with Cell Viability
and Intracellular
Trafficking
For a preliminary evaluation of disulfide-core-crosslinked
nanogels for biological applications, first their cytotoxicity was
examined using a 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide (MTT) assay with HeLa cancer cells. As seen in Figure 7, the nanogels had the viability
to be >85%, suggesting that they are not toxic to the cells up
to
the concentration of 400 μg/mL. Further, the nanogels were examined
for their intracellular tracking by epi-fluorescence microscopy (Figure 8). Doxorubicin (Dox)-loaded
disulfide-core-crosslinked nanogels were fabricated and purified by
the intensive dialysis method to remove free Dox molecules. The formed
nanogels had the diameter = 168 nm on average by DLS analysis and
3.3% of loading level by UV/vis spectroscopy (Figure S5). HeLa cells incubated with Dox and Dox-loaded nanogels
show a strong fluorescence signal inside the cells and around the
perinuclear region. This indicates that both Dox and Dox-loaded nanogels
were taken up by the cells. Further, a stronger Dox fluorescence signal
from cells treated with Dox-loaded nanogels indicate that the micelles
were taken up by the cells to a greater extent in comparison to free
Dox.

copolymer. Note that untreated cells as negative control (NC) and
cells treated with 1% Triton-X100 as positive control (PC).

Figure 8 Fluorescence microscopy images of HeLa cells incubated
with (a)
free Dox (20 μg/mL) and (b) Dox-loaded nanogels (encapsulated
Dox = 20 μg/mL) for 24 h.

Acid/Reduction-Responsive Tunability of Thermoresponsive Properties
Dual acid/reduction-responsive degradation was further investigated
for the tunability of thermoresponsive properties of the copolymer.
PKM-10 containing 10 mol % hydrophobic HMssEt was examined for DLS
analysis (Figure 9).
GPC analysis confirms the significant cleavage of acetal and disulfide
linkages under acidic, reductive, and both conditions (Figure S6) to form the possible degraded products
(see Figure 5a). When
the PKM-10 was incubated in acidic pH, the LCST of PKM decreased from
61.8 to 51.9 °C (PKM-OH) by 10 °C. Such a decrease can be
attributed to the loss of water-soluble PEG block upon the cleavage
of junction acetal linkage. In the reductive environment, the LCST
of PKM increased to 70 °C (PKM-SH), which is presumably due to
the increase in polarity upon the cleavage of disulfide pendants to
more hydrophilic thiol groups. When the copolymer was treated with
both acidic pH and reduction, the LCST of PKM-OH-SH was determined
to be 57.5 °C. It is lower by 13 °C than PKM-SH (single
reduction) but greater by 6 °C than PKM-OH (single acid). These
results suggest that thermoresponsive properties of the double hydrophilic
copolymers can be tuned with the change in both hydrophilicity and
hydrophilic/hydrophobic balance upon the stimuli-responsive cleavage
of labile linkages at the block junction and in hydrophobic pendant
chains.

over temperature for PKM-10 and its degraded products formed after
the incubation with acid, DTT, and both.

Conclusions
A new approach utilizing ATRP enabled the synthesis
of a thermoresponsive
DHBC consisting of PEG block connected through an acetal linkage with
a thermoresponsive polymethacrylate block, yielding PEG-acetal-P(OEOMA-co-HMssEt), capable of degrading in response to dual reducing
and acidic environments. Its thermoresponsive property as LCST decreased
with an increasing density of hydrophobic HMssEt unit up to 30 mol
%. These block copolymers formed nanoaggregates through temperature-driven
self-assembly in aqueous solution and further converted to disulfide-core-crosslinked
nanogels through disulfide–thiol exchange reaction providing
enhanced colloidal stability. Dual reductive response in cores and
acid response at core/corona interfaces promoted the disassembly of
the formed nanogels to water-soluble species, anticipating enhanced
release of bioactive molecules and facile removal of degraded products
from action sites. The results from cell culture experiments suggest
low cytotoxicity and good cellular uptake. Further, the copolymer
exhibits improved tunability of its thermoresponsive property upon
reduction and acid degradation individually or simultaneously.

Experimental
Section
Instrumentation
1H NMR spectra were recorded
using a 500 MHz Varian spectrometer. The CDCl3 singlet
at 7.26 ppm was selected as the reference standard. Spectral features
are tabulated in the following order: chemical shift (ppm); multiplicity
(s—singlet, d—doublet, t—triplet, m—complex
multiple); number of protons; position of protons. Monomer conversion
by 1H NMR analysis and molecular weight and its distribution
by GPC were determined. An Agilent GPC equipped with a 1260 Infinity
Isocratic Pump and an RI detector as well as two Agilent PLgel mixed-C
and mixed-D columns run with DMF containing 0.1 mol % LiBr at 50 °C
at a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min. Molecular weights were calibrated with
linear poly(methyl methacrylate) standards from Fluka. Clear solution
of aliquots of the polymers dissolved in DMF/LiBr was filtered using
a 0.40 μm polytetrafluoroethylene filter to remove any DMF-insoluble
species. A drop of anisole was added as a flow rate marker. The size
of nanoaggregates in hydrodynamic diameter (Dv) was measured by DLS at a fixed scattering angle of 175°
at 25 °C with a Malvern Instruments Nano S ZEN1600 equipped with
a 633 nm He–Ne gas laser. TEM images were obtained using a
Philips Tecnai 12 TEM, operated at 80kV and equipped with a thermionic
LaB6 filament. An AMT V601 DVC camera with point-to-point resolution
and line resolution of 0.34 and 0.20 nm, respectively, was used to
capture images at 2048 by 2048 pixels. To prepare specimens, aqueous
dispersions were added dropwise onto copper TEM grids (400 mesh, carbon
coated), blotted, and allowed to air dry at room temperature.

Measurements
of Thermoresponsive Properties of PKM Using DLS
The purified,
dried polymer (10 mg) dissolved in PBS (pH = 7.4,
10 mL) was stabilized overnight to form aqueous clear solutions at
1.0 mg/mL (0.1 wt %). After being filtered through the 0.45 μm
polyethersulfone filter to remove unexpectedly formed large aggregates,
aliquots were transferred to a quartz cuvette and then sealed with
a Teflon stopper. Their changes in light scattering intensity were
measured in triplicates at an increment of 1 °C at a temperature
range of 10–90 °C.

as
received. Poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) monomethyl ether with MW = 5000
g/mol and EO# = 113 purchased from Aldrich was dried by azeotropic
distillation with toluene to remove residual moistures. OEOMA with
MW = 300 g/mol purchased from Sigma-Aldrich was purified by passing
through a column filled with basic aluminum oxide to remove inhibitors.
TPMA49 and a methacrylate having a pendant
disulfide linkage (HMssEt)50 were synthesized
as described elsewhere.

Synthesis of PEG-ac-Br
An organic
solution consisting
of PEG (4.3 g, 0.85 mmol) distilled from toluene (15 mL) and PPTS
(20 mg, 0.1 mmol) dissolved in dichloromethane (40 mL) was mixed with
a solution of VE-Br (6.1 g, 26.5 mmol) in dichloromethane (10 mL)
under stirring at room temperature for 72 h. After the addition of
Et3N (250 μL, 3.4 mmol) to quench the reaction, the
resulting mixture was washed with aqueous PBS solution (pH = 7.4,
50 mL) four times and then precipitated from anhydrous diethyl ether
more than three times to remove unreacted VE-Br. The product was isolated
by vacuum filtration and dried in a vacuum oven, yielding a white
solid (2.2 g, 84%). 1H NMR (CDCl3, ppm): 4.82

General
Procedure for ATRP To Synthesize Block Copolymers
PEG-ac-Br,
OEOMA, HMssEt, TPMA, CuBr2, and anisole were
mixed in a 25 mL Schlenk flask and deoxygenated by nitrogen purging
for 1 h in an oil-bath heated to 40 °C. Following purging in
nitrogen, a prepurged solution of Sn(II)(EH)2 in anisole
was injected into the Schlenk flask to initiate polymerization. Polymerization
was stopped by cooling down the solution to room temperature in an
ice-bath and exposing it to air. For kinetic studies, aliquots were
withdrawn periodically to analyze conversion and molecular weight.

[Cu(II)TPMA-Br]Br (2.3 mg, 4.8 μmol), anisole (6.6 g), and Sn(II)(EH)2 (15.5 mg, 38.2 μmol) for PKM-10; and PEG-ac-Br (0.5
g, 0.1 mmol), OEOMA (1.4 g, 4.7 mmol), HMssEt (0.7 g, 1.83 mmol),
TPMA (4.2 mg, 14.3 μmol), [Cu(II)TPMA-Br]Br (2.5 mg, 4.8 μmol),
anisole (7.1 g), and Sn(II)(EH)2 (15.5 mg, 38.2 μmol)
for PKM-30.

For purification, the as-synthesized solutions were
diluted with acetone (150 mL), passed through a basic aluminum oxide
column to remove residual Cu species and ligand, and precipitated
from hexane to remove unreacted monomers. The resultant precipitates
were dried in a vacuum oven for overnight.

Reversible
Assembly/Disassembly upon Temperature Change
The purified,
dried PKM-30 (10 mg) was dissolved in PBS (pH = 7.4,
10 mL) at room temperature. An aliquot of the resulting aqueous solution
(1.5 mL) was transferred to a quartz cuvette and kept in a water-bath
pre-set at 10 °C for 30 min and then 60 °C for 30 min. DLS
analysis was conducted to determine the size in diameter by volume
upon change in the temperature.

Investigation of Acid/Reduction-Responsive
Degradation in DMF
For acid degradation, PKM-30 (650 mg)
dissolved in DMF (9 mL) was
mixed with 15 N HCl (50 μL, [H+] = 82 mM). For reductive
degradation, PKM-30 (100 mg) dissolved in DMF (8 mL) was mixed with
DTT (64 mg, 0.4 mmol). For dual degradation, sequential acid-degradation
followed by reduction was performed. PKM-30 (650 mg) dissolved in
DMF (9 mL) was mixed first with 15 N HCl (50 μL, [H+] = 82 mM) and then following DTT (385 mg, 2.4 mmol). GPC was used
to follow any changes in molecular weight and its distribution. Note
that the concentrations of junction acetal and pendant disulfide linkages
in PKM-30 were estimated with monomer conversion for DP and 2-hydroxyethyl
methacrylate/OEOMA mole ratio by NMR analysis.

In Situ-Disulfide-Core-Crosslinking
to Nanogels
PKM-30
(21 mg, 0.02 mmol of pendant disulfide linkages) was dispersed in
PBS (pH = 7.4, 6 mL) for a concentration of 0.3 wt % at 60 °C
for 2 h and then mixed with an aqueous solution of DTT (0.5 mg, 0.2
mol equivalent to disulfides) in PBS (pH = 7.4, 1 mL) for 24 h. For
purification, the resulting dispersion of disulfide-core-crosslinked
nanogels was dialyzed against PBS buffer (pH = 7.4) for 24 h. DLS
analysis was conducted at 10 °C.

Dual Acid/Reduction-Degradable
Disassembly of Disulfide-Core-Crosslinked
Nanogels
An aqueous disulfide-core-crosslinked PKM-30 nanogel
dispersion (3 mL, 2 mg/mL) was mixed with aqueous acetate buffer solution
(15 mL, pH = 4.5) for acid degradation, DTT (15.7 mg, 0.1 mmol) for
reductive degradation and both for dual degradation under stirring.
DLS analysis was used to follow the degradation of nanogels.

Encapsulation
of Dox
An aqueous solution of PKM-30
(21 mg) dissolved in PBS (pH = 7.4, 5 mL) was mixed with an organic
solution of Dox (2.0 mg) and Et3N (2.0 mg) dissolved in
DMF (1.0 mL). The resulting mixture was heated to 60 °C at which
was treated with DTT (0.6 mg, 0.2 mol equivalent to disulfides) for
24 h. After being cooled to room temperature, the resulting dispersion
was purified by intensive dialysis with a dialysis tubing (MWCO =
3500 g/mol) against PBS (2 L × 7) for 13 h. Outer PBS was changed
over 7 times to remove residual (not encapsulated) Dox molecules in
the dispersion. In this way, Dox-loaded disulfide-core-crosslinked
nanogels dispersions were prepared at 3.5 mg/mL. Loading level of
Dox was determined by UV/vis spectroscopy with the extinction coefficient
of Dox (ε = 12,400 M–1 cm–1) determined in a mixture of water/DMF (1/5 v/v) at λmax = 497 nm.51

Cytotoxicity by MTT Assay
HeLa cells cultured in Dulbecco’s
modified Eagle medium (DMEM) containing 10 vol % fetal bovine serum
and 1 vol % penicillin–streptomycin solution was harvested
at 80% confluency, and 6 × 103 cells were seeded into
each well of 96 well plate. After incubation at 37 °C for 24
h, the media was replaced with DMEM (100 μL) containing different
concentrations of micellar dispersion, and the cells were further
incubated at 37 °C for 48 h. Untreated cells as NC and cells
treated with 1% Triton-X100 as PC were used. The media was then replaced
with DMEM (100 μL) containing 10% MTT dye and incubated at 37
°C. After 4 h, MTT solution was carefully removed and the formazan
crystals were dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide (200 μL). The absorbance
at 570 nm was measured using Tecan Infinite M200 PRO microplate reader,
and the cell viability was calculated using the formula. Cell viability
was calculated as the percent ratio of absorbance of mixtures with
micelles to control (cells only without NPs).

Cellular Uptake by Epifluorescence
Microscopy
HeLa
cells were seeded at a concentration of 1 × 105 cells/mL
into a 35 mm glass bottom plate and cultured in DMEM. After 24 h,
the media was replaced with DMEM containing either Dox or Dox-loaded
micelles such that the final concentration of Dox in the micelles
was 20 μg/mL. After a 4-h incubation, the cells were washed
with PBS (3 times) and PBS containing 2 μL of Hoechst 33342
(5 mg/mL) added to the cells to stain the nucleus. After 15 min incubation
in the dark, the stain solution was replaced with phenol-red free
DMEM and the cells were observed by Nikon Eclipse TiE inverted epifluorescence
microscope.

Investigation of Thermoresponsive Properties
upon Acid/Reduction-Responsive
Degradation
PKM-10 copolymer was incubated with HCl, DTT,
and both as described previously. The formed degraded products were
purified by precipitation from cold diethyl ether. The resultant precipitates
were dissolved in acetone and passed through a column of basic aluminum
oxide in an attempt to remove PEG-OH species that were formed as a
consequence of the cleavage of junction acetal linkages. For reductive
degradation, the precipitates were dried in a vacuum oven without
filtration.
