Expanded
π-systems with a narrow highest occupied molecular
orbital–lowest unoccupied molecular orbital band gap encounter
deactivation of excitons due to the “energy gap law”
and undesired aggregation. This dilemma generally thwarts the near-infrared
(NIR) luminescence of organic π-systems. A sophisticated cofacially
stacked π-system is known to involve exponentially tailed disorder,
which displays exceptionally red-shifted fluorescence even as only
a marginal emission component. Enhancement of the tail-state fluorescence
might be advantageous to achieve NIR photoluminescence with an expected
collective light-harvesting antenna effect as follows: (i) efficient
light-harvesting capacity due to intense electronic absorption, (ii)
a long-distance exciton migration into the tail state based on a high
spatial density of the chromophore site, and (iii) substantial transmission
of NIR emission to circumvent the inner filter effect. Suppression
of aggregation-induced quenching of fluorescence could realize collective
light-harvesting antenna for NIR-luminescence materials. This study
discloses an enhanced tail-state NIR fluorescence of a self-standing
porphyrin film at 1138 nm with a moderate quantum efficiency based
on a fully π-conjugated porphyrin that adopts an amorphous form,
called “porphyrin glass”.

Introduction
There is a growing
fascination with near-infrared (NIR) photoluminescent
materials aiming at potential applications in a wide range of fields
along with the availability of the semiconductor, indium gallium arsenide
(InGaAs), to detect NIR light longer than 1 μm, namely, in the
shortwave infrared (SWIR) region.1−3 A narrow highest occupied
molecular orbital–lowest unoccupied molecular orbital band
gap is indispensable to NIR photoluminescence. Among them, fully π-conjugated
low-band-gap polymers have hitherto been a pivotal subject in organic
photovoltaic applications because NIR light-harvesting capacity has
a crucial role in photovoltaic efficiency.4−7 However, narrow energy gaps are
intrinsically prone to fast deactivation, known as the “energy
gap law”.8,9 Additionally, the expansion of
π-conjugated systems is usually accompanied by a drawback arising
from the propensity for π-stacking. These bottlenecks make the
design of bright NIR photoluminescent chromophores and polymers highly
challenging. Actually, lowering the band gap of π-conjugated
polymers is not always effective in shifting the emission wavelength
to the red unlike the absorption band; poor emission efficiency of
some narrow-band-gap polymers apparently violates Kasha’s law,10−13 although that defines the fluorescence as radiative decay from the
lowest optical absorption band.14 To overcome
the intrinsic inefficiency of NIR/SWIR emission, high excitation efficiency
should ensure the brightness of the emission, considering the fact
that brightness of emission is defined as the product of light absorption
efficiency and emission quantum yield. In this consequence, a strongly
light-absorbing material is a possible candidate to yield bright NIR/SWIR
emission, even if the emission quantum yield remains inefficient.

A greater absorption band enhances not only efficient light-harvesting
capacity but also the inner filter effect in which fluorescence is
usually reabsorbed, thus reducing the emission intensity. A large
Stokes shift of the emission should increase only the light-harvesting
antenna effect by circumventing the inner filter effect. It is known
that the structural distribution of chromophore assemblies is the
sum of Gaussian statistics and tail states, such as exponential tail15,16 or heavy-tailed Lévy distributions (Scheme 1 and Figure 1).17−21 Although the tail states display only a marginal fluorescence component,
enhanced tail-state fluorescence might be a rational strategy to obtain
effective NIR/SWIR emission. We envisioned that bulk chromophore aggregates
could evolve the emission wavelength up to the lowest edge of the
electronic absorption band through enhanced exciton funneling efficiency.
Accordingly, only the tail-state fluorescence could be substantially
obtained. From this point of view, bulk chromophore assemblies may
be intriguing as NIR/SWIR luminescent materials.

fluorescence spectrum as the sum of Gaussian statistics (black solid
lines) and exponential tails (red dotted line) (A) and the space coordinate

Scheme 1 Synthesis of 2
Our approach to achieving NIR photoluminescent materials
involves
imparting a glassy nature to zinc porphyrin by accommodation with
two 3,4,5-tri((S)-3,7-dimethyloctyloxy)phenyl groups
at the meso-positions, called “porphyrin glass” in this
study.22 Molecular glasses or amorphous
molecular materials have introduced an excellent morphological strategy
in organic optoelectronic devices based on small molecules and polymers.23−26 The porphyrin glass is highly resistant to crystallization and is
tolerant of expansion of the π-system through supramolecular
and covalent polymerization.27,28 In principle, the amorphous
or glass phase is kinetically constrained from crystallization and
incorporates a free volume in the frozen liquid by losing macroscopic
fluidity. Thus, the free volume allows some extent of microscopic
conformational fluctuation in the photoexcited state, leading to excimer
formation. Consequently, the glassy butadiynylene-bridged porphyrin
dimer formed the excimer and exhibited solid-state NIR photoluminescence
at approximately 970 nm with submicrosecond time constants,22 and further expansion of stacked π-systems
through supramolecular polymerization achieved SWIR photoluminescence
at approximately 1 μm with microsecond decay time constants.27 In contrast to a thermodynamically preferable
supramolecular polymer structure due to the reversible backbone formation,
the covalently linked polymer backbone likely entraps kinetically
preferable states. Encouraged by the fact that no aggregation-caused
fluorescence quench occurred in porphyrin glass, we explored the NIR/SWIR
fluorescence properties of the covalent polymer of the porphyrin glass,
expecting the increased probability of the formation of the tail states
in bulk.

Oligomeric conjugated porphyrin arrays demonstrate
excellent NIR
fluorescence in organic solutions,29,30 where the meso-ethynylene conjugation is a privileged motif of excellent
π-electronic features, as established by Anderson et al.31−34 and Therien et al.29,35−39 To date, π-conjugation engineering of meso-ethynylene porphyrin arrays has been extended to fully
conjugated polymers.40−52 However, the porphyrin-conjugated polymers possess a drawback arising
from large π-systems, such as undesired aggregation. Featuring
an intrinsically glass-forming porphyrin unit, the “molecular
wire effect” could be effective in incorporating a light-harvesting
antenna function,53−56 in a manner similar to the supramolecular polymer of porphyrin glass.27 Our present objective focuses on a covalently
linked polymer glass with a fully π-conjugated backbone.

One of the most efficient π-conjugations of aryl-bridged
ethynyl-conjugated porphyrin dimers has been achieved by a possible
resonance between a benzenoid–acetylene and quinoidal–cumulenic
conjugation. This approach was proposed by Anderson and co-workers
using a 9,10-anthracene-bridged ethynyl-conjugated porphyrin dimer
for the first time57−59 and has been reported for other aryl-bridges such
as thiophene,57−59 pentacene,60 benzobisthiadiazole,60 dimethylthiadiazoloquinoxaline,61 and dithienometallole.62 However,
further extension to an alternating anthracene–porphyrin polymer
has not been conducted. Along with the study of porphyrin glass, we
recently reported an alternating anthracene–porphyrin polymer 1 (Mn = 54 000, Mw/Mn = 4.2, Tg = 94 °C) that formed a metal-lustrous
self-standing film, “porphyrin foil” (Figure 2).28 Polymer 1 exhibited a remarkably red-shifted Q band
at 904 nm, together with a high refractive index, as an outcome of
the considerable persistence length of the π-conjugated backbone.63,64 Compared with a newly synthesized model compound 2,
this study discusses an SWIR fluorescent system based on the collective
light-harvesting antenna effect of the porphyrin foil.

Results and Discussion
NIR Emission Behaviors
in Solution
Polymer 1 exhibited an exceptionally
long Q band at 904 nm, whose intensity
was unusually stronger than that of the Soret band at 438–543
nm (Figure 3A). In
principle, the Q band of porphyrin is optically only partially allowed,
and therefore the Q band is usually much weaker than the Soret band.31 To the best of our knowledge, an unusually intense
Q band was not reported except for a few exceptions: butadiyne-linked
octaethylporphyrin array40−42 and the meso-ethynylene-conjugated porphyrin array with an alternating pyrido[3,4-b]pyrazine-zinc porphyrin sequence45 other than a supramolecular polymer of the porphyrin glass in our
previous study.27 The intense and red-shifted
Q band should be an outcome of the increased π-conjugation.

absorption spectra of 1 at 298 K in
toluene (red line) and spectrometric titration with pyridine (gray
and green lines). (B) Fluorescence spectra of 1 in toluene
under argon-saturated conditions obtained by excitation at 450 nm
in the absence and presence of pyridine (red and green, respectively),
together with normalized excitation spectra monitored at 800 nm (gray
line) and 1000 nm (black line) in the absence of pyridine.

Extended π-system often causes undesired
aggregation even
under dilute conditions. The addition of an axial ligand is effective
in the dissociation of stacked zinc porphyrins. The addition of pyridine
to 1 gave rise to a blue shift of the Q band from 904
to 885 nm with remarkable sharpening, although the emission maxima
shifted to the red (Figure 3A). The observed spectral change was unusual, considering
that axial coordination typically resulted in a red-shift of the Q
band. Actually, a titration experiment of model compound 2 with pyridine resulted in a small red-shift of both the Soret bands
at approximately 440 and 530 nm, of the Q bands from 690 to 710 nm,
and fluorescence maxima (Figure 4), where the electronic structures were relevant to
the reported homologue.57 The spectral
change through several pseudo-isosbestic and isoemissive points and
the estimated binding strength indicated that 2 was substantially
free from aggregation under the experimental conditions. Comparison
with the electronic structure of 2 emphasizes the exceptionally
sharp Q band of 1 in the presence of pyridine together
with the extended π-conjugation. The band width of the Q band,
which mirrors the torsional conformations around the ethynylene linkage,
was reminiscent of that of the conjugated porphyrin array with all
of the units fully planar,32,34 suggesting a narrow
conformational distribution. Considering the very low torsional barrier
around the ethynylene linkage,57 the 3,4,5-tri((S)-3,7-dimethyloctyloxy)phenyl groups may enhance the geometrical
complementarity of π-stacked interactions, similar to the π-stacked
porphyrin arrays even in the presence of pyridine.65−67 We consider
that a higher molecular weight component of polymer 1 could provide a π-stacked and/or entangled structure. We discuss
the electronic properties of polymer 1 in the absence
of pyridine to directly compare the photoelectronic properties in
solution with those in a pyridine-free amorphous phase.

constants were estimated as K1 = 4.1 ×
104 M–1 and K2 = 8.3 × 103 M–1 based on global
titration analyses (B).

Photoluminescence properties of polymer 1 were
different
from those of Kasha’s law14 at a
glance. Polymer 1 showed a relatively strong emission
at 827 nm, together with a weak emission at 944 nm (Figure 3B), whose emission lifetime
was ranged in the time scale of fluorescence. It should be noticed
that the principal emission at 827 nm was attributed to the energy
level at 1.53 eV (809 nm as the midpoint of the deconvoluted absorption
maximum and emission maximum), higher than the lowest excited state
at 1.34 eV (929 nm as the midpoint of the deconvoluted absorption
maximum and the longer emission maximum) (Figure 5). The fluorescence maximum at 827 nm was
much longer than that of 2 at 743 nm in toluene, indicating
that the energy level of the fluorescent species of 1 is lower than that of the π-conjugated domain of a porphyrin–anthracene–porphyrin
unit.

Figure 5 Possible Jablonski diagram, combined with the electronic absorption
spectrum deconvoluted with Gaussian-curve fitting (yellow) and the
fluorescence spectrum (green) in toluene.

A similar fluorescence behavior is known for low-band-gap
polymers,
such as poly{benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl}{3-fluorothieno[3,4-b]thiophenediyl}, called “PYB7” it has one
of the most excellent properties for photovoltaic applications, exhibiting
fluorescence at a shorter wavelength than the longest absorption band.
This effect is attributed to the folded structure.6−10 To access the fluorescence properties, the excitation
spectra (Figure 3B)
were compared with the deconvoluted electronic absorption spectrum
(Figure 5). The distinctive
difference of the longer emission at 944 nm from the shorter emission
at 827 nm was the greater contribution of the excitation at 543 nm.
Additionally, the emission efficiency at 944 nm was very low when
the longest Q band at 909 nm was excited. Then, the entire observations
may be interpreted in a manner similar to the case of PYB7; photoexcitation
of polymer 1 produced two distinct states, that is, a
localized exciton on an isolated shorter chain and a relatively delocalized
exciton on the stacked or entangled longer chain. The lowest level
at 1.34 eV may be prone to deactivation according to the energy gap
law,13,14 thus dissipating the exciton to reduce the
emission efficiency at 944 nm. In solution, exciton funneling from
the localized state to the delocalized state may be ineffective due
to their large spatial separation between energy-donating and energy-accepting
sites, where the Förster critical radius governs the distance
of exciton migration.67 Thus, the shorter
emission band at 827 nm was relatively conspicuous. The rational mechanism
for the fluorescence behaviors of 1 in toluene is proposed
in Figure 5.

The above explanation for the complicated fluorescence behavior
of polymer 1 assumes partial aggregation or entanglement
of the polymer backbone depending on molecular weight. A spin-cast
film of 2 prepared from toluene solution would provide
aggregates, whose fluorescence behavior could provide fruitful insights
into the fluorescence properties of polymer 1. The spin-cast
film of 2 showed a split Q band at 680 and 770 nm and
the finely structured Soret band at 443 and 537 nm due to exciton
coupling (Figure 6),
unambiguously indicating partial aggregation. The emission of the
spin-cast film at 958 nm showed remarkably large Stokes shift, suggesting
excimer formation. The close similarity of the emission wavelength
of the spin-cast film of 2 at 958 nm and the solution
of 1 at 944 nm may indicate structural resemblance of
the emission species.

excitation
(gray) spectra of a spin-cast film of 2 on a quartz substrate.
Emission and excitation spectra were obtained by excitation at 443
nm and monitoring at 958 nm, respectively.

Solid-State SWIR Photoluminescence
In the second stage,
our attention was focused on the porphyrin foil of 1,
a bulk self-standing neat film approximately 160 μm in thickness
(Figure 2C). In the
porphyrin foil, 1 adopted a form of amorphous phase at
room temperature.28 The porphyrin foil
exhibited emission at 1138 and 950 nm (Figure 7). In this case, the considerable overlap
of intense absorption of the porphyrin foil should distort the spectral
shape in the wavelength region shorter than the Q band and the normal
emission should partly emerge at 950 nm, although the SWIR emission
longer than the Q band should also be transmitted. Thus, the spectral
shape of the SWIR fluorescence of the porphyrin foil was not strictly
the same depending on the experimental conditions (Figures 7, 8, and S3). The small difference in the
excitation efficiency and/or the collective light-harvesting antenna
efficiency also affected the intensity of the fluorescence at approximately
950 nm, although the wavelength of the SWIR fluorescence band was
reproducible. More importantly, the lack of the emission at 809 nm
suggested that the localized exciton was substantially converted to
the delocalized exciton, and consequently the tail state. The NIR/SWIR
emission of 1 was obtained in 0.26% of external quantum
yield, which encompassed a moderate efficiency as the emission in
this wavelength region. Although the quantum efficiency remained comparable
to the conventional NIR-luminescence chromophores, the considerable
light-harvesting capacity of the porphyrin foil led to significant
brightness of the SWIR emission.

Figure 7 Emission–excitation contour map
of the porphyrin foil. Excitation
spectrum monitored at 1000 nm (black line), absorption spectrum obtained
by spectroscopic ellipsometry (gray line, adapted from ref (28)) (left panel), and emission
spectra obtained by excitation at 470 and 800 nm (upper panel). It
should be noticed that no emission at 827 nm was found.

Figure 8 Possible Jablonski diagram, combined with the electronic
absorption
spectrum in toluene (yellow) and the fluorescence spectrum of porphyrin
foil (red).

The spectral shape showed
no excitation wavelength dependence (Figure 7), unlike the fluorescence
properties in toluene. This fact provides direct evidence that the
energy conversion efficiency to the lowest level was unity irrespective
of the initial photoexcited level. In the porphyrin foil, the close
proximity of the fully conjugated porphyrin arrays should be appropriate
for enhancing interchromophore Coulombic coupling for efficient exciton
funneling to the lowest energy trap.67 Although
the inner filter effect should also involve trivial energy transfer
through emission/re-excitation processes, the contribution should
be insignificant considering substantial fluorescence quantum yield.

On the contrary, the spin-cast film of 1 exhibited
very faint fluorescence, whose SWIR component was only marginal (Figure S4; details described in the Supporting
Information). The collective light-harvesting antenna effect shifted
the emission wavelength up to the lowest edge of the electronic absorption
band and produced SWIR luminescence.

The emission lifetime measurements
of the porphyrin foil revealed
that the emission at 1138 nm decayed within a subnanosecond time scale
(Figure S3), elucidating that the SWIR
emission was definitively in the time range of fluorescence, in contrast
with the unusually long emission lifetime of the solid-state NIR/SWIR
photoluminescence of previous porphyrin glasses.23,27 Therefore, the SWIR fluorescence was likely assigned to the radiative
process from the self-trapped exciton at the tail state. The interpretation
is most pertinent to the SWIR fluorescence of the porphyrin foil,
as represented in Figure 8.

The comparison of the synchrotron wide-angle X-ray
diffraction
(WAXD) profile of the porphyrin foil and glazing-incidence (GI) WAXD
profile of the spin-cast film may corroborate the above fluorescence
behaviors (Figure 9A). The whole WAXD peaks of the porphyrin foil were broader than
the GIWAXD peaks, indicating that the crystalline domains of polymer 1 in the bulk were smaller or more disordered than those in
the spin-cast film. The intensity of the primary GIWAXD peak at d = ca. 30 Å depended on the azimuthal angle (Figure 9B). On the basis
of the geometry-optimized model, the d-spacing of
ca. 30 Å may be assignable to the rodlike polymer stacking (Figure 10A). At an azimuthal
angle of 90° along the qz axis, the
peak intensity showed the maximum (Figure 9C), indicating that the chain axis of the
rodlike polymer chains was parallel to the surface of the silicon
wafer and they stack on one another perpendicular to the surface.
Our previous study revealed that the 3,4,5-tri((S)-3,7-dimethyloctyloxy)phenyl groups segregate to the outer surface
and reduce the surface free energy of the porphyrin foil.28 Judging from these results, the polymer chains
confined by the surface differentiated from the bulk.

foil (red line, adapted from ref (28)) and GIWAXD profile of

nm–1 (C).

Figure 10 Geometry-optimized models of the bundle structure of π-stacked
chains (blue and red chains) (A), and distorted single backbone (B)
produced using an MM+ force field (HyperChem Ver. 8.0 software).

The population of the tail state
should be minor and unobservable
by GIWAXD measurements. In this context, the GIWAXD peaks observed
the structures that acted as the light-harvesting antenna. We propose
possible structures based on the geometry-optimized model for the
WAXD peaks (Figure 10). The anthracene bridging unit of 1 produces a space
to stack with the porphyrin ring on the juxtaposed backbone, and the
interdigitation of 3,4,5-tri((S)-3,7-dimethyloctyloxy)phenyl
groups provides a π-stacked structure with a longitudinal displacement
(Figure 10A). The
structure is consistent with Bragg’s reflections for the interchain
Zn···Zn distances of 10.3 and 8.7 Å as observed
at the magnitude of the scattering vector, q, of
6.1 and 7.2 nm–1, respectively. The peak found at
the d-spacing of 16.7 Å implied a nonlinearly
ordered backbone with ca. 16.7 Å of the intrachain Zn···Zn
spacing (Figure 10B) and overwhelmed the peak of the 18 Å of the intrachain Zn···Zn
separation in the π-stacked backbone. Additionally, the broad
peak at q = ca. 14 nm–1 was attributed
to the halo peak for amorphous alkyl chains, being accompanied by
small peaks corresponding to the interchain π-stacked spacing
of 3.7 Å. On the contrary, in the GIWAXD pattern measured for
the spin-cast film of 1, with rodlike polymer stacking
having d = ca. 30 Å, some possible π-stacked
structures were observed (Figure 9B). On the basis of the fact that the SWIR fluorescence
quantum yield ranged in a moderate order, these structures did not
quench the photoexcited singlet. A slipped-cofacial arrangement of
π-stacked porphyrin rings (Figure 10A) could be rational for a long-distance
exciton migration because of the close resemblance of the chromophore
arrangement in the bacterial light-harvesting antenna complexes.68−70

Of particular importance, the amorphous halo peak at q = ca. 14 nm–1 in the porphyrin foil
was more significant
than that in the spin-cast film, suggesting that the polymer chain
incorporated free volume more as relieving the surface confinement
in a bulk. On the basis of this comparison, we interpret that the
bulk porphyrin assembly raised the probability of the formation of
the tail states.

To ensure photofunctionality under conditions
of exceptionally
high spatial density of porphyrin rings, an effective morphological
strategy featuring porphyrin glass should play a key role in the suppression
of undesired aggregation. Therefore, collectively, the light-harvesting
antenna function of the porphyrin foil imparted the SWIR with fluorescent
properties based on the following factors: (i) an intense electronic
absorption band captured the excitation light, (ii) the high spatial
density of porphyrin mediated the long-distance exciton migration,
and (iii) the substantial transmission of NIR emission circumvented
the inner filter effect. The bright SWIR fluorescent site was likely
assigned to the tail state, where the plausible structure was the
interchain π-stacked structure or the distorted backbone.

Conclusions
Considerable absorption by the porphyrin foil
showed substantial
light-harvesting capacity in the excitation light as well as reabsorption
of the fluorescence. The collective light-harvesting capacity efficiently
funneled the exciton into the tail state, despite its low population.
The exceptional Stokes shift from the absorption band circumvented
the inner filter effect and yielded the SWIR fluorescence at 1138
nm at a moderate efficiency. The porphyrin glasses in relatively thermodynamically
preferable states, such as porphyrin dimer and supramolecular polymer,
showed excimer-like emission with sub- or microsecond time constants,
as shown in our previous study.22,27 By contrast, the covalently
linked backbone of the fully conjugated porphyrin glass kinetically
entrapped the tail states, wherein the lack of undesired aggregation
of the porphyrin rings is of particular importance to accomplish the
collective light-harvesting antenna function. The present approach
highlighted a new methodology to ensure the brightness of the SWIR
emission with an inevitably low quantum efficiency.

(5 mL) degassed by successive freeze–pump–thaw cycles
was added Pd(PPh3)4 (4.8 mg, 4.2 μmol),
9,10-diethynylanthracene (7.5 mg, 29 μmol), and CuI (1.4 mg,
7.4 μmol). The mixture was stirred at 60 °C under argon
atmosphere for 15 h and then diluted with toluene to be washed with
water. The organic layer separated was passed through a silica gel
chromatography with toluene as the eluent. Target compound 2 was isolated by size-exclusion chromatography (toluene/pyridine,
95:5, v/v). 2 was obtained as a dark green substance

Spectral Methods
NMR spectra were recorded on Bruker
AVANCE III 600, and matrix-assisted laser-dissociationionization time-of-flight
(MALDI-TOF) mass spectra were performed by Bruker Autoflex Speed.
Electronic absorption spectra were recorded on a spectrophotometer
(UV-1800, SHIMADZU) equipped with a Peltier thermoelectric temperature-controlling
unit (TCC-240A, SHIMADZU). The NIR steady-state emission spectra were
recorded on a Fluorolog 3 ps NIR spectroscopy system (HORIBA) and
corrected for the response of the detector system. Emission lifetimes
(τ) of the spin-cast film were measured by nano-LEDs (N-355,
response time ≤1.2 ns, HORIBA, Kyoto) and a photomultiplier
(R5108, response time ≤1.1 ns, Hamamatsu Photonics, Hamamatsu).
Emission lifetimes were determined from the slope of logarithmic plots
of the decay profiles. The absolute quantum measurement was performed
by QE-5000 (Otsuka Electronics, Osaka) using an integrated sphere
equipped with an excitation laser (450 nm). Time-resolved NIR fluorescence
was performed by a microscopic UV/IR spectroscopic system (NX-FILM-T03,
Tokyo Instruments, Inc.). GIWAXD experiments of the spin-cast film
were performed using synchrotron radiation at the BL45XU beamline
in SPring-8 (RIKEN SPring-8 Centre Hyogo, Japan) using a PILATUS 3X
2M (Dectris Ltd.) at 308.6 mm of the sample-to-detector distance.71 Resonance Raman spectra were performed by a
microscopic spectroscopic Raman spectrometer (HORIBA, LabRAM ARAMIS)
