A convenient method
of synthesis has been developed for a new class
of potential cooling agents, menthol glycinates. These compounds are
prepared in two synthetic steps, starting from bromoacetyl bromide
and (−)-menthol. The resulting brominated menthol ester readily
undergoes substitution reactions with NH3 and 1° or
2° amines to provide menthol glycinates. For most of the prepared
compounds, the two-step synthetic procedure requires no aqueous phase
extractions.

==== Body
Introduction
Menthol is a major
commodity chemical which is derived from both
natural and semisynthetic sources.1 The
worldwide usage of purified menthol is estimated to be over 20,000
metric tons annually.2 Its usage includes
numerous flavor applications as a cooling component and as a local
anesthetic in medicinal formulations and skin products. Among the
several known stereoisomers of (−)-menthol, these have been
shown to be less effective cooling agents than (−)-menthol.
In taste dilution tests, (−)-isomenthol exhibits a cooling
threshold at 30.0 ppm, whereas (−)-menthol has a cooling threshold
of just 0.8 ppm.3 Nevertheless, there has
been ongoing interest in the development of agents having even more
potent cooling effects. This includes (−)-menthol derivatives
such as the esters of (−)-menthol, (−)-menthol ethers,
menthol-related amides, and other varied structures (Figure 1).3 Depending on the assay used, WS-3 and WS-5 are both shown to have
stronger cooling effects than (−)-menthol, whereas 4-methyl-3-(1-pyrrolidinyl)-2[5H]-furanone is estimated to have 35 times more cooling effects
than (−)-menthol.3

Figure 1 Known cooling agents.

No one has examined the use of menthol glycinates
(1) among the derivatives of (−)-menthol that
show cooling effects.
Glycine itself has been used as a flavor-enhancing component;4 so, we reasoned that glycine esters with (−)-menthol
could have potential as cooling agents. In the following note, we
describe an efficient synthetic route to a diverse set of menthol
glycinates (Scheme 1).

Scheme 1 Menthol Glycinates (1)
Results
and Discussion
Initial efforts to prepare menthol glycinates
were sought to couple
glycine and related derivatives with (−)-menthol. However,
these reactions were less than satisfactory; so, an alternative route
was devised. We hypothesized that the menthol glycinates could be
built stepwise by a sequence involving acyl transfer chemistry followed
by nucleophilic substitution. Thus, an optimized procedure coupled
(−)-menthol with bromoacetyl bromide in dichloromethane (DCM)
with excess anhydrous sodium carbonate (Scheme 2). The conversion is quantitative, and product 2 is sufficiently pure that no purification steps are generally
required. The acyl transfer chemistry is complete within 3 h, after
which the product is isolated by simple filtration and removal of
the DCM solvent. If nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) or gas chromatography
(GC) analysis of 2 shows any remaining (−)-menthol,
product 2 is readily purified by vacuum distillation.
Compound 2 has been previously synthesized by various
methods, including coupling menthol with bromoacetic acid, bromoacetyl
chloride, and bromoacetyl bromide.5 In
addition to the quantitative yield, our procedure has the advantage
of avoiding an aqueous workup of the product mixture. Similar coupling
reactions are known for chloroacetyl chloride;6 however, in our hands, these conversions were not as clean as the
synthesis of derivative 2. Compound 2 is
the ideal scaffold for building menthol glycinates as it is expected
to be highly reactive toward nucleophilic substitution.5a

Scheme 2 Preparation of Bromoacetate Substrate (2)
An optimized substitution reaction
was developed by reacting compound 2 with amines in ethyl
acetate (Table 1).
For example, dimethylamine is added to
a solution of bromide 2 with added NaOH and anhydrous
Na2SO4 (Scheme 3). With vacuum distillation, menthol glycinate 3 is isolated in 90% yield. In order to achieve substitution
with ammonia, the chemical reaction performed by adding an ethyl acetate
solution of bromide 2 directly into a flask containing
liquid ammonia at −78 °C. This provides the glycine ester
of menthol (4) in good yield. A variety of secondary
amines provided the corresponding menthol glycinates. This includes
the dialkylamines to give products 5–7, 13, and 15–16. Heterocyclic systems, such
as pyrrolidine and piperidine, were also found to give the substitution
products (8 and 9, respectively) in good
yields. Primary amines also give the expected substitution products 10, 12, 14, and 17.
The synthetic method is amenable to the incorporation of structural
components such as cycloalkyl groups, benzyl groups, ethers, and heterocycles.
In the case of the pyridyl derivative 18, this compound
is modeled after the known cooling agent, amide 19 (FEMA
4549, Scheme 4), which
is estimated to be about 100 times cooler than menthol.3 In addition to monosubstitution, products may
be prepared from double-substitution reactions. These types of structures
could potentially be used in the design of multivalent ligands, a
principle that has been used to improve the binding of substrates
to receptor sites.7 Isopropyl amine reacts
twice when an excess of bromide 2 is used, and compound 20 is isolated. Similarly, N,N′-dimethylethylene diamine reacts twice with bromide 2 to provide compound 21. Both 20 and 21 are purified by the removal of excess bromide 2 via distillation, followed by purification using silica
gel chromatography (Scheme 5).

Scheme 5 Double-Substitution Products Prepared
Table 1 Products and Yields from the Substitution
Reactions of Bromide 2 with Amines or Ammonia
For most of the substitution reactions described
above, the optimized
procedure involves using an excess of the amine nucleophile. The menthol
glycinate products are isolated in pure form by removing the ethyl
acetate solvent and excess amine by reduced pressure. Then, menthol
glycinate is typically distilled at 150–220 °C @ 1 mm
Hg. Optimization studies revealed that the excess amine allows the
substitution chemistry to go to completion within a relatively short
period of time. For example, dibutylamine was reacted with bromide 2 to provide compound 7, and with 1.1 equiv of
the amine, the substitution reaction is only 79% complete after 3
h. If the amount of dibutylamine is increased to 1.6 equiv (0.13 M
in ethyl acetate), then the substitution reaction is 100% complete
in less than 3 h.

Conclusions
In summary, we have
developed a simple methodology to prepare a
series of menthol glycinates. Starting from bromoacetyl bromide, bromoester 2 is prepared quantitatively. This substrate undergoes substitution
reactions with a series of N-nucleophiles to give
menthol glycinates 3–21 in generally good yields.
The procedure avoids the need for extractions or aqueous workup. The
products menthol glycinates are considered potential cooling agents,
similar to other derivatives of menthol. As variants of (−)-menthol, it is expected that some
of these derivatives should have strong affinities for the TRMP8 receptor
site which provides the physiological sensation of cooling, as well
as other biological or medicinal effects.8 Preliminary screening of the new menthol glycinates has shown that
several derivatives possess intense oral cooling sensations,9 including delayed onset cooling and prolonged
cooling. Further testing of their potential as new cooling agents
is currently in progress.

Experimental Section
Preparation of (1R,2S,5R)-2-Isopropyl-5-methylcyclohexyl
2-Bromoacetate (2)10
To 100 mL of CH2Cl2, (l)-menthol (7.2
g, 0.046 mmol) is
dissolved and anhydrous Na2CO3 is added. The
resulting solution is cooled to 0 °C and the flask is fitted
with a CaCl2 drying tube. Bromoacetyl bromide (4.0 mL,
0.046 mol) is then added, the cooling bath is removed, and the solution
is stirred for a minimum of 4 h. Following the reaction period, the
solution is filtered through a glass wool and the solvent is removed
by a vacuum. The product is isolated as a clear colorless oil (12.2
g, 0.044 mol, 96%). The analysis of the crude product by GC-flame
ionization detector (FID) and NMR shows an extremely high purity of
the product; however, the oil may be further refined by distillation
(ca. 120 °C, 2 mm). With repeated runs, the yields of the crude
product vary from 95 to 100%.

General Procedure for the
Synthesis of Menthol Glycinates (1° Amines)
The amine (0.02 mmol) is dissolved
in 25 mL of EtOAc, after which is added NaOH (0.6 g, 15 mmol) and
anhydrous sodium sulfate (0.5 g, 3.5 mmol). To this solution, (1R,2S,5R)-2-isopropyl-5-methylcyclohexyl
2-bromoacetate (1.68 g, 6.06 mmol) is slowly added. The mixture is
stirred for 6 h or until the GC-FID analysis shows no remaining bromoester
(2). The solution is then filtered through a plug of
glass wool and the solvent is removed by reduced pressure. For low-boiling
amines, the excess amine is removed during this step. For less-volatile
amines, fractional distillation may be necessary. The final purification
of the menthol glycinate is achieved by vacuum distillation.

(1R,2S,5R)-2-Isopropyl-5-methylcyclohexyl 2-Aminoacetate (4)12
Into a cooled (−78 °C)
round-bottom flask, ammonia (ca. 2 mL, 80 mmol) is condensed and NaOH
(0.5 g, 12.5 mmol) is added to the flask. To this flask, an addition
funnel is connected. Menthol bromoacetate (1, 1.4 g,
5.0 mmol) is dissolved in 10 mL of ethyl acetate, and this solution
is placed in the addition funnel. The solution of 1 is
then added slowly to liquid ammonia. The resulting mixture is stirred
at −30 °C and monitored by periodically taking samples
and subjecting these samples to GC-mass spectrometry (MS) analysis.
Typically, the conversion is complete within 6 h. If it is only partially
complete, additional ammonia is condensed into the cooled flask. Following
the completion of the reaction, the mixture is allowed to warm to
room temperature and the excess ammonia boils off. To the reaction
mixture, anhydrous sodium sulfate is added and the mixture is filtered
through a plug of silica gel. The reaction flask is rinsed with 10
mL of ethyl acetate, and the solution is passed through silica gel.
The solvent is removed by a vacuum to provide a clear oil. Further
purification is accomplished by vacuum distillation at 150 °C
(1 mm) and 0.467 g (2.2 mmol, 42%).
