Sulfur-containing compounds are a
class of important motifs extensively
applied in pharmaceutical and pesticidal industries as well as in
electrochemistry, toxicant separation, and organic syntheses. Herein,
we describe a novel and efficient metal-free catalytic strategy for
the rapid synthesis of β-thioketones from sustainable enone
derivatives and thiols via thia-Michael addition enabled by heterogeneous
prolinamide. At room temperature, up to 98% yield of β-thioketones
could be obtained over the solid UiO-66-NH-proline catalyst facilely
prepared by the covalent immobilization of proline onto UiO-66-NH2 (a well-known metal–organic framework) via a stable
amido linkage. A cooperative effect of proline (amino group) and UiO-66-NH2 (in situ-derived amide species) was observed to play a promotional
role in the proceeding of thia-Michael addition, resulting in a high
TOF value of 1124.3 h–1. A three-component “iminium”
intermediate was illustrated to the key species approaching the product
β-thioketone. Moreover, the UiO-66-NH-proline could be easily
recovered from the reaction mixture and recycled for at least five
times with a slight loss of activity.

1 Introduction
To
alleviate the reliance of industrial chemicals and fuels derived
from fossil resources, one of the strategies is to synthesize renewable
chemicals from the catalytic valorization of lignocellulosic biomass
derivatives.1,2 Nowadays, many commodity chemicals
and pharmaceuticals bear one or more heteroatoms. However, it is quite
challenging to efficiently introduce heteroatom elements regioselectively
into hydrocarbons. Most of the current technologies put pressure on
our environment, which typically involves the formation of chemical
waste and high energy consumption. Therefore, it would be promising
to develop alternative strategies for the sustainable production of
value-added chemicals containing heteroatom moieties to meet the requirements
for more green chemical industry.2−6 Some simpler organosulfur molecules can be found in various biological
systems and present in nature.7 Likewise,
the sulfur atom is also an important species employed in the chemical
industry.8,9 For example, some of those sulfur-containing
compounds (e.g., thiophene, fucoidan, and lignosulfonate) can be applied
in the production of surfactants and biomedicines.10−13 Considering that the synthesis
of sulfur-containing chemicals from natural resources is widely unexplored,
and the problems such as high energy consumption and low catalyst
reusability are generally encountered,10−12 the development of milder
and more efficient methods for C–S coupling of renewable resources
to synthesize new sulfur-containing compounds is highly necessary.2

Among various methodologies for the establishment
of C–S
bond, thia-Michael addition is one of the general strategies for site-specific
reactions at C=C bonds to promote the formation of C–S
bond, which has attracted great attention in synthetic chemistry and
constitutes a key reaction in various biosynthetic processes.9,14−18 In addition, this reaction also plays a critical role in the material
chemistry and the synthesis of bioactive compounds especially those
possessing antibacterial, antifungal, and anticancer activities.19−23 Although some methodologies on thia-Michael addition were reported
in a lot of literature (Scheme 1),24−27 there are various limitations such as high temperature, long reaction
time, the requirement of unique techniques to prepare catalysts, and
the use of expensive and toxic metals.28 Thus, the further development of sustainable routes for the synthesis
of renewable and feasible chemicals from biomass needs to circumvent
those problems.

Scheme 1 Schematic Illustration of Catalytic Strategies Used
for Thia-Michael
Addition
Enones, especially
chalcones also named (E)-1,3-diphenylpropene-1-ones,
are widely distributed in the plant kingdom, which can be used as
privileged and simple chemical scaffolds of many natural α,β-unsaturated
carbonyl compounds.29−31 Importantly, these compounds exert a great deal of
biological and pharmacological activities.29,32,33 The application of eco-friendly synthetic
methods for the synthesis of valued-added chalcones has aroused great
interest among organic chemists. Currently, the strategy used for
catalytic upgrading of chalcone was focused on the reduction of the
α,β-unsaturated system by microorganisms, although this
method has some obvious disadvantages including slow reaction, low
yield, and poor selectivity.34 Moreover,
the method of utilizing microwave and ultrasound irradiation for the
transformation of chalcones into heterocyclic compounds has still
controversy about its “greenness”. Instead, organocatalysis
is especially advantageous when metal-free productions or processes
are of primary concern, which thus performs a key principle of green
chemistry.31 However, few studies have
been reported about the synthesis of biomass-derived enones (e.g.,
chalcones) using an organocatalytic approach.35−37

Proline
and its analogs play a crucial role in the flourishing
period of organocatalysis because they are typically inexpensive,
nontoxic, and environmentally friendly.38−44 Meanwhile, metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) was applied in
the various fields including energy technologies and the application
of chemistry because of its unique and outstanding properties.45−47 In the present study, proline was simply immobilized onto a highly
stable porous material UiO-66(Zr)-NH2 with covalent linkage
to prepare an organocatalyst (UiO-66-NH-proline). UiO-66-NH-proline
bearing cooperative active sites (−NH2 and −CONH−)
in combination with the suitable choice of organic solvent (DMSO)
was found to exhibit pronounced activity in the synthesis of β-thioketones
from enone derivatives and thiols via thia-Michael addition (Scheme 1), giving a high
TOF value of up to 1124.3 h–1. Because of the heterogeneous
nature and good stability, the catalyst could be recycled for several
consecutive cycles with no decline in the reactivity. Importantly,
the developed catalytic system was also applicable to a variety of
substrates to synthesize corresponding β-thioketones in good
yields. Notably, almost 100% atom-efficiency was realized via the
thia-Michael addition reaction process.

FT-IR spectra of UiO-66-NH2 and UiO-66-NH-proline
are
collected in Figure 1a. Typical characteristics of the UiO-66-NH2 were observed,
including symmetric N–H stretching bands (3384 cm–1), N–H bending (scissoring) vibration at 1626 cm–1, and the strong C–N stretching absorption distinctive of
aromatic amines at 1356 cm–1. The primary aromatic
amino group displayed two medium absorptions of asymmetric N–H
stretching bands (3507 cm–1).49−52 In comparison with UiO-66-NH2, UiO-66-NH2-proline had several additional weaker
peaks at 3507 and 3384 cm–1, and the strong peak
at 3196 cm–1 was due to the formation of amide between
the NH2 group of the UiO-66-NH2 and the carboxyl
group of proline. These results indicate that free proline was successfully
immobilized onto the UiO-66-NH2 via the stable amido linkage.51

The XRD spectra of UiO-66-NH2 and UiO-66-NH-proline
are shown in Figure 1b. It can be clearly seen that the pattern of UiO-66-NH2 was consistent with that of UiO-66-NH-proline, which is typically
consisted of an inner Zr6O4(OH)4 core
where the triangular faces of the Zr6-octahedron are alternatively
capped by μ3-O and μ3-OH groups.53 This result indicates that the presence of the proline did not play
any influence on the structure of the MOF. The N2 adsorption–desorption
isotherms of UiO-66-NH2 and UiO-66-NH-proline are shown
in Figure 1c, and the
BET surface areas of UiO-66-NH2 and UiO-66-NH2-proline are 603.3 and 88.8 m2 g–1,
respectively. The decline in the surface area after amido functionalization
could be due to the significantly decreased micropores of UiO-66-NH2 (Figure S1). These results, on
the other hand, confirmed the immobilization of proline onto the surface
and pores of UiO-66-NH2.

To investigate the thermal
stability of UiO-66-NH2 and
UiO-66-NH-proline, TG analysis was implemented, and the results are
illustrated in Figure 1d. From ambient temperature to 600 °C, the first weight loss
at below 100 °C could be attributed to the loss of residual solvent
from of materials. The second weight loss of 5–7% was observed
at up to 400 °C, which is possibly because of the framework decomposition
and removal of water molecules. However, an additional weight loss
event was observed in the temperature range of 100–400 °C
in the case of UiO-66-NH-proline, which could be ascribed to the thermal
decomposition of the proline group. From 400 to 600 °C, the residual
weight of UiO-66-NH2 was lower than UiO-66-NH-proline,
indicating that UiO-66-NH-proline contained a certain amount of organic
matter residue.

HAADF-STEM with elemental mappings was performed
to study the elemental
dispersion and morphology of UiO-66-NH2 and UiO-66-NH-proline
(Figure 2a,b). The
elements of C, N, O, and Zr were evenly distributed in both UiO-66-NH2 and UiO-66-NH-proline. In addition, the particle size of
UiO-66-NH-proline (average diameter: ca. 74.3 nm) was found to be
larger than UiO-66-NH2 (average diameter: ca. 45.9 nm),
as disclosed by TEM images (Figure S2a,b).

2.2 Optimizing Reaction Conditions of 1,4-Thia-Michael
Addition
2.2.1 Effect of Various Catalysts
Thia-Michael
addition of enones is a typical reaction to produce β-thioketones
via the formation of the C–S bond. Thus, the 1,4-thia-Michael
addition of enone A1 with 1-propanethiol to 1,3-diphenyl-3-(propylthio)propan-1-one
(B1) in DMSO at 25 °C for 12 h was chosen as the
model reaction in the presence of 20 mol % of different control catalysts,
and the obtained results are shown in Figure 3. Almost no reaction occurred in the absence
of any catalyst or even in the presence of Cat. 1 (tert-butyl 2-(phenylcarbamoyl)pyrrolidine-1-carboxylate), Cat. 2 (methyl l-prolinate hydrochloride), Boc-l-proline, and UiO-66-NH2-proline-Boc. In contrast,
UiO-66-NH2 (containing ca. 0.037 mmol proline unit per
gram, as determined by elemental analysis) and proline could afford B1 in yields of 18 and 69%, respectively (Figure 3). These results indicate the
promotional effect of amino species and the synergistic role between
amino and carboxyl groups in the 1,4-thia-Michael addition. Gratifyingly, Cat. 3 (N-phenylpyrrolidine-2-carboxamide)
was able to give a satisfactory B1 yield of 87%, implying
the crucial role of the prolinamide fragment in the reaction.54,55 More interestingly, an excellent B1 yield (98%) was
obtained as UiO-66-NH-proline (0.37 mol %) and used as the catalyst.
This unprecedented result demonstrates the cooperative effect of the
solid support (UiO-66) and prolinamide, which could be promoted by
the in situ formed iminium between the carbonyl group of the substrate
and the amino species of the catalyst.

2.2.2 Effect
of Solvent Type, Temperature, and
Catalyst Dosage
The effect of different solvents was further
examined to optimize the reaction conditions for the 1,4-thia-Michael
addition of enone with 1-propanethiol to produce B1,
and the results are summarized in Figure 4a. In the presence of 0.37 mol % UiO-66-NH-proline
at 25 °C, the use of hexane, tert-butanol, dichloromethane
(DCM), 1,4-dioxane, methanol, and DMSO as solvents could give the
product B1 with the yield of 7.0, 9.0, 10, 12, 42, and
98%, respectively. Clearly, DMSO was the best solvent for the reaction,
possibly because of its high polarity (Figure 4a) and the good solubility toward the reactants.
Then, the effect of temperature on the reaction was examined, for
example, at the temperature of 25 °C, 92% yield of A1 was achieved after 12 h. When the reaction temperature was gradually
raised to 40, 60, and 80 °C, the comparable yield of A1 was achieved after 8, 6, and 5 h, respectively. In most cases, the
reaction temperature of 25 °C was chosen, which is highly applicable
to a wide range of substrates, showing great potential in the efficient
synthesis of various β-thioketones via C–S bond formation
under benign conditions.

Considering the pronounced catalytic
activity in the 1,4-thia-Michael addition of enone (A1) with 1-propanethiol, the dosage of UiO-66-NH-proline was further
examined to study the catalyst efficiency (Figure 4b) at 25 °C in DMSO. It was clearly
observed that the B1 yield significantly increased from
64, 88, 95, and 98% to 99% with the increase of catalyst dosage from
1.0 mg (0.037 mol %), 5.0 mg (0.19 mol %), 10.0 mg (0.37 mol %), and
20.0 mg (0.74 mol %) to 30.0 mg (1.11 mol %), respectively. It was
worth noting that using 10, 20, or 30 mg of UiO-66-NH-proline resulted
in almost quantitative yields of B1. From the economic
point of view, 10 mg was selected as the optimal catalyst dosage,
which was thus employed for the following investigations.

2.2.3 Reaction Kinetic Studies
The reaction
time is another key factor affecting the efficiency of the catalytic
processes. At the reaction temperature of 25 °C, the TOF value
of the reaction could reach 1124.3 h–1 in 1 min
for the 1,4-thia-Michael addition reaction (Figure 5). This reaction rate is much higher than
those achieved in many other similar coupling reactions (e.g., TOF
= 54.6 h–1 for the aza-Michael reaction using MOF-199,
and TOF = 2.75 h–1 for aldol reaction using MOPMs).56,57 However, the reaction gradually became slow with further prolonging
the reaction time to 5 min, which was probably due to the coverage
of the active sites (prolinamide) by the reactant or product. These
results, on the other hand, indicate the formation of relatively stable
intermediates like iminium species that can be fast formed in the
very early stage, whereas the lack of active sites caused by saturated
adhesion with organics in the following period may limit its further
conversion. Therefore, a relatively long reaction time seems to be
necessary to achieve satisfactory product yields.

2.2.4 Catalyst Recycling Studies
In the
view of green chemistry and potential practical application, it would
be much promising if the solid catalyst can be recovered and reused
for consecutive recycles. In this regard, the recoverability and reusability
of the UiO-66-NH-proline catalyst were thus investigated for the thiol-Michael
reaction of enone A1 with 1-propanethiol for five successive
reaction runs under optimized reaction conditions of using DMSO as
solvent at 25 °C for 12 h. After each cycle of the reaction,
the resulting mixture was filtered, whereas the recovered solid catalyst
was thoroughly washed with ethanol, dried in an oven at 70 °C
for 4 h, and directly used for the next cycle. As shown in Figure 6, the UiO-66-NH-proline
catalyst exhibited almost constant catalytic activity in five consecutive
cycles with the product yield slightly decreasing by 9%, which is
much superior to previously reported solid catalysts.58 The leaching content of Zr species from the UiO-66-NH-proline
catalyst was determined by inductively coupled plasma optical emission
mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) with the aid of acid digests. The contents
of Zr in the fresh and used (after 5 cycles) catalysts were found
to be 30.0 and 29.7 wt %, respectively, indicating little Zr leaching
into the reaction mixture (ca. 0.3 wt %). Likewise, elemental analysis
disclosed that ca. 0.2 wt % nitrogen content (fresh: 4.5 wt %, used:
4.3 wt %) was leached in the five consecutive cycles. The XRD spectra
of fresh and reused (after five cycles) UiO-66-NH-proline catalysts
exhibit no obvious change between each other (Figure 7), indicating that the loss of catalytic
activity could be ascribed to the organic adsorption. These results
illustrate that the UiO-66-NH-proline catalyst can maintain its crystalline
structure during the reaction process under the tested conditions.

2.2.5 Heterogeneous Catalytic Behavior
To examine
whether the solid UiO-66-NH-proline catalyst behaves as
heterogeneous catalysis in the 1,4-thia-Michael addition reaction,
the effeciency of the leached Zr and N species were investigated under
the identical reaction conditions (Table 1). On the basis of the leaching content determined
by ICP analysis, 0.06 or 0.3 wt % Zr in ZrCl4 and/or 0.04
or 0.2 wt % nitrogen in 2-aminoterephthalic acid or proline were employed
as potential homogeneous active species. As shown in Table 1, both the used homogeneous
Zr and N species gave little or quite low yields of B1, clearly indicating the dominant activation role of the heterogeneous
UiO-66-NH-proline catalyst in the sulfa Michael addition reaction.
In addition, filtration experiments were also carried out, where the
solid UiO-66-NH-proline catalyst was rapidly separated by centrifugation
after 5 min. As illusrated in Figure 8, the yield of B1 was not found to evidently
increase even after another 30 min. These results explicitly confirm
the heterogeneous catalytic behavior of the UiO-66-NH-proline catalyst
in the reaction process, further proving the cooperative effect of
the solid support (UiO-66) and prolinamide in the tested sulfa-Michael
addition reaction.

2.3 Substrate Scopes
Delighted by above
pronounced catalytic performance over UiO-66-NH-proline, the substrate
scope was further expanded by using a number of enone derivatives A1–A25 and thiols C1–C4 under optimized reaction conditions (Figure 8). As expected, good isolated yields of product B were obtained using DMSO as a solvent at 25 °C. When
no substituent or electron-donating group such as 2-methoxyl was present
in the ortho- or para-position of
the benzene ring, moderate to excellent yields of products were obtained
(B11–B17, B23, B24: 70–98% yields). Whereas moderate yields were achieved
(B2–B6, B18–B22: 61–81% yields) as R2 was heterocyclic
or electron-withdrawing group located on the benzene ring. Both the
electron-donating (e.g., R1 = 4-hydroxyphenyl) and electron-withdrawing
group (e.g., R2 = 3-chlorophenyl) could attain moderate
product yields (B7–B10: 70–79%
yield). Not only enones derived from nature (e.g., A1) but also the ones (e.g., A21) synthesized from bio-based
molecules 2-acetyl-5-methylfuran and furfural could be used as substrates
to afford moderate isolated yields of corresponding products. In addition,
substrates also have a moderate tolerance for different cyclic enones
to give C1–C2 in 60–76% isolated
yields, and for various thiols to give D1–D4 in 69–88% isolated yields under the same reaction
conditions. When the reaction temperature was increased to 60 °C,
the enones with a sterical and electronical methyl substituent in
β-position could give B26 and 2-cyclohexen-1-one C2 in moderate yields. To further expand the scope of the
thia-Michael addition reaction, a value-added compound D5, which is an allosteric PIF-Pocket ligand of phosphoinositide-dependent
protein kinase 1(PDK1),59−61 was also produced with a good
yield of 87% in only 20 min. In contrast, as high as 70% yield of D5 was obtained over triethylamine in a previous report, and
much longer time (2 h) was required.61 These
results explicitly indicate that our developed catalytic system is
highly applicable to a wide range of enone derivatives, showing great
potential in the efficient synthesis of various valuable β-thioketones
via C–S bond formation under benign reaction conditions. Furthermore,
the enantioselectivity (ee) values of some representative products
(e.g., B1) were determined, and no more than 5% ee values
could be obtained (Figures S3, S4, and S5). The low ee values, on the other hand, can be an evidence that
the solid UiO-66-NH-proline catalyst was prepared by the covalent
immobilization of proline onto UiO-66-NH2 via a stable
amido linkage.

2.4 Proposed Reaction Mechanism
Before
discussing the reaction mechanism, enone (A1) with different
molar ratios (0.1–1.0 M) of tetrahydropyrrole was mixed and
elucidated by 1H NMR spectra. However, no evident change
in intensity and chemical shift assigned to enone was observed. In
turn, during the experimental processes, the reaction color was changed
by mixing pyrrolidine with 1-propanethiol (Figure S6). Accordingly, UV analysis was adopted to further verify
the possible reaction mechanism by dissolving 20 μM A1 or A21, 22 μM 1-propanethiol, and/or 20 μM
pyrrolidine into DMSO. Solutions consisted of different reaction mixtures
were analyzed using a UV spectrophotometer (TU-1900). As expected,
three components were highly needed to work together to afford the
target products in both cases (Figure 10).

reaction mixtures
in DMSO: (a) 20 μM enone A1, (b) the mixture of
20 μM enone A1 and 20 μM pyrrolidine, (c)
the mixture of 20 μM enone A1 and 22 μM 1-propanethiol,
(d) the mixture of 20 μM enone A1, 20 μM
pyrrolidine, and 22 μM 1-propanethiol, (e) 20 μM enone A21, (f) the mixture of 20 μM enone A21 and 20 μM pyrrolidine, (g) the mixture of 20 μM enone A21 and 22 μM 1-propanethiol, (h) the mixture of 20
μM enone A21, 20 μM pyrrolidine, and 22 μM
1-propanethiol.

As illustrated in Figure 3, proline and Cat. 3 can afford B1 in moderate yields of 69–87%,
indicating the promotional
effect of amino species especially the prolinamide fragment in the
1,4-thia-Michael addition. Notably, the unprecedented result obtained
with 0.37 mol % UiO-66-NH-proline (98% B1 yield) demonstrates
the cooperative effect of the solid support (UiO-66) and prolinamide,
which can be facilitated by the in situ formed iminium between the
carbonyl group of the substrate and the amino species of the catalyst.
On the basis of the above discussions, Figure 11 vividly depicts the possible mechanism
where three components composed of UiO-66-NH-proline, enones, and
thiol are first subjected to form an “iminium ion” intermediate
via dehydration, which is similar to that reported in literature,62−66 followed by addition and hydrolysis to give the product β-thioketone.

3 Conclusions
In summary, we developed
an efficient C–S coupling approach
for the thia-Michael addition at room temperature enabled by heterogeneous
prolinamide immobilized on the stable and porous support UiO-66(Zr).
A simple method was developed to successfully prepare the novel catalyst
UiO-66-NH-proline, which was demonstrated to possess moderate proline
loading (ca. 0.037 mmol proline unit per gram, as determined by elemental
analysis) and be highly recyclable for at least five cycles with little
decrease in catalytic activity. With this catalytic system, a series
of sulfur-containing scaffolds were synthesized from enone derivatives,
including biomass-derived chalcones. Interestingly, reaction kinetics
was further studied, and the resulting TOF value of the reaction was
up to 1124.3 h–1. The possible reaction progress
was illustrated by ex situ UV–Vis analysis, where the in situ
formed “iminium” intermediate was demonstrated to be
crucial for efficiently yielding the β-thioketone product. The
rapid and green synthesis of β-thioketones from enone derivatives
and thiols in the assistance of prolinamide on UiO-66(Zr) in DMSO
at room temperature shows promising applications in the establishment
of C–S bonds for value-added fine chemicals.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Reagents and Methods
2-Mercaptoethanol
(≥99.5%), methyl thioglycolate (98%), mercaptoacetic acid (>98.0%),
and 2-aminoterephthalic acid (NH2-H2BDC, 98.0%)
were purchased from TCI (Shanghai) Development Co., Ltd. Oxalyl chloride
(98%), Boc-l-proline (98%), ZrCl4 (98%), trifluoroacetic
acid (98.0%), 1-propanethiol (98%), 1-pentanethiol (99.5%), methyl l-prolinante hydrochloride (98.5%), l-proline (99%),
cyclopentanethiol (98%), and 2-methyl-3-tetrahydrofuranthiol (98%)
were bought from Aladdin Industrial Inc. (Shanghai). Other chemicals
were of analytical grade (or > 98% purity) and used as received,
unless
otherwise noted.

All compounds were fully characterized by spectroscopic
data. The NMR spectra were recorded on Bruker Avance I (1H NMR 400 MHz, 13C NMR 101 MHz) and JOEL ECX-500 M (1H NMR 500 MHz, 13C NMR 125 MHz). Chemical shifts
(δ) are expressed in parts per million (ppm), J values are given in hertz, and DMSO-d6 and CDCl3 were used as solvents. The reactions were monitored
by a thin-layer chromatography (TLC) using silica gel GF254. HRMS
(ESI) analysis was measured on a Q Exactive UHPLC–MS/MS instrument
(Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, USA). UV–Vis spectra were
performed on a TU-1900 spectrophotometer (Beijing Pgeneral Instrument
Co., China). The enantioselectivity (ee) values of samples were determined
by HPLC analyses, which were measured on Water systems with a Empower3
system controller, an Alliance column heater, and a 2998 Diode Array
Waters 2489 UV–Vis detector. Chiralcel brand chiral columns
from Daicel Chemical Industries were used with models ASH, or OD-H
in 4.6 × 250 mm size. All chemicals and solvents were used as
received without further purification unless otherwise stated.

4.2 Preparation of UiO-66-NH2
The synthesis
of UiO-66-NH2 was performed according to
a previously reported method48 with slight
modification. In a typical procedure, 0.24 g of ZrCl4 (1.029
mmol) and 0.186 g of 2-aminoterephthalic acid (1.029 mmol) were dissolved
into 60 mL DMF in a stainless steel autoclave. Then, the autoclave
was sealed and heated in an oven at 120 °C for 48 h under autogenous
pressure. Upon completion, the reactor was automatically cooled down
to room temperature, followed by filtration, and washed with DMF (20
mL × 3) and methanol (20 mL × 4). The obtained solid was
then dissolved into 60 mL methanol in a 100 mL round-bottom flask,
and heated to 60 °C under vigorously stirred for 12 h. After
cooling down, the reaction mixture was subjected to filtration, and
the resulting precipitate was dried at 70 °C overnight in an
oven to give the metal–organic framework UiO-66-NH2 as pale yellow powder.

4.3 Preparation of UiO-66-NH-proline-Boc
The immobilization of Boc-proline onto UiO-66-NH2, denoted
as UiO-66-NH-proline-Boc, was achieved as follows. DMF (206 μL)
and oxalyl chloride (250) were added into DCM (about 20 mL) in a round
bottom flask, which was then placed into an ice bath under magnetic
stirring for 10 min, followed by additions of 223 μL pyridine
and 595 mg Boc-proline under magnetic stirring for another 1 h at
room temperature. Afterward, UiO-66-NH2 was added into
the above mixture and stirred overnight. The resulting mixture was
filtered and washed twice with DCM and once with water, finally dried
at 40 °C overnight to afford UiO-66-NH-proline-Boc as yellow
powder.

4.4 Preparation of UiO-66-NH-proline
The synthesis of UiO-66-NH-proline was performed by the following
procedures. UiO-66-NH-proline-Boc (395.0 mg) and trifluoroacetic acid
(2 mL) were dissolved into DCM (about 20 mL) in a round bottom flask
placed in an ice bath. After stirring 6 h at room temperature, 20
mL of water was added into the mixture. The mixture was then basified
with a 50% NaOH (about 2 mL) aqueous solution was dripped to pH =
7.5–8.0. The resulting precipitate was filtered off, washed
with 10 mL DMSO and 50 mL ethanol, and then dried to give UiO-66-NH2-proline as white powder.

4.5 Catalyst
Characterization
Scanning
transmission electron microscope and high-angle annular dark-field
(STEM-HAADF) imaging were measured by JEOL 2100 TEM/STEM. FT-IR spectra
were recorded on a Nicolet iS 10 FT-IR instrument (KBr disc; Thermofisher,
MA) in the range of 400–4000 cm–1. Scanning
electron microscopy (SEM) image was performed using a FESEM XL-30
(Philips) electron microscope. X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements
were carried out using a D/Max-3c X-ray diffractometer with a radiation
source of Cu Kα, scanning from 5 to 90°, at an operating
voltage and current of 40 kV and 30 mA, respectively. BET (Brunauer–Emmett–Teller)
surface areas of the porous materials were determined from nitrogen
physisorption measurements at liquid nitrogen temperature on a Micromeritics
ASAP 2010 instrument. The volume of pores was estimated from the BJH
adsorption cumulative volume of pores. Thermogravimetric (TG) analysis
was conducted using a Netzsch STA 429 instrument in a temperature
range of 25–600 °C with a heating rate of 10 °C min–1 under N2 atmosphere (flow rate: 30 mL
min–1). The products obtained by 1,4-thia-Michael
addition were dissolved in CDCl3 or DMSO-d6 for NMR analysis. UV–Vis spectra were performed
on a TU-1900 spectrophotometer (Beijing Purkinje general Instrument
Co., China). Elemental analysis on nitrogen was performed on an Elemental
Vario-III CHN analyzer (Hanau, Germany). Zr contents of the fresh
and used UiO-66-NH-proline catalysts were determined by ICP-MS on
Thermo Scientific iCAP Q ICP-MS with the aid of acid digests. The
fresh and used UiO-66-NH-proline samples were digested in 70% nitric
and 98% sulfuric acids (1/1, v/v) at 90 °C for 12 h, and the
resulting solution was then diluted 20 times with water before ICP
analysis.
