After coal is treated by thermal
solution of solvent, a certain
amount of thermal solution oil and residue can be obtained, and the
macromolecular network structure in coal can also be relaxed. These
will inevitably affect the emission of harmful gases and distribution
of the pore structure when the residue is made into activated carbon
(AC). In this paper, the effects of thermal solution pretreatment
on the microcrystalline structure, surface properties, pore structure
of resultant ACs at different temperatures, and their catalytic performances
in methane decomposition to hydrogen were investigated. The results
show that the surface oxygen-containing functional groups of the residue-based
ACs are changed, and the specific area of ACs increases from 1730
to 2652 m2/g with the increase in activated temperature.
The pore diameter distribution of ACs also is changed. In the process
of methane decomposition to hydrogen, the residue-based ACs show higher
catalytic activity than coal-based ACs. AC-1123-1 and AC-1123 show
the best stability, while AC-823-1 has the highest initial activity.
With the increase in activated temperature, residue-based ACs show
higher activity and stability, and partial fibrous carbon is deposited
on the surface of ACs after the reaction. It is thought that increased
mesoporosity is beneficial to the catalytic activity and stability
of AC in methane decomposition to hydrogen, and the reduction of surface
oxygen-containing functional groups contribute to the formation of
fibrous carbon on the surface of AC after the reaction.

1 Introduction
Hydrogen is not only an
important raw material in chemical production
but also a kind of clean fuel. Many scholars were committed to obtaining
hydrogen from hydrocarbons or water by means of thermochemistry and
electrochemistry.1 Up to now, steam methane
reforming (SMR) technology is generally used to produce hydrogen in
industrial production. However, a large amount of carbon dioxide (CO2) will be generated in this process. In order to remove the
CO2, purification devices must be added, which will lead
to a significant rising cost of hydrogen production.2

Catalytic methane decomposition (CMD) is a hydrogen
production
method with simple process and byproduction of carbon materials. This
process has attracted the attention of researchers because there is
no generation of CO and CO2. Many metal catalysts (such
as Fe,3−5 Co,6−9 Ni,10−13 etc.) had been applied in the process of transformation and had
been proven by studies that these catalysts can effectively promote
the methane decomposition to hydrogen. However, carbon deposition
is easy to be generated in the process, which leads to the deactivation
of metal catalyst. The regeneration cost of the catalyst is often
expensive, and this process will release a large amount of CO2 again. These factors will greatly limit the industrial application
of this technology. In view of metal catalyst’s disadvantage,
carbon materials are considered to be most alternative catalyst. Compared
with the metal catalyst, they are low cost and have strong characteristics
such as high temperature resistance and high sulfate resistance, and
the used catalyst of carbon materials can be directly used in the
preparation of high specific volume electrodes and so on. Besides,
it may also avoid the high cost of catalyst activation and large production
of CO2.14,15 Muradov16 studied the catalytic effect of 30 different carbon materials, including
activated carbon, carbon black, graphite, diamond, carbon fiber, carbon
nanotube, etc., and found that the catalytic activity of carbon materials
is significantly related to their source, structure, and surface area.
Most researchers stated that there is no linear relationship between
the surface area of carbon materials and its initial catalytic activity.17−20 It is generally believed that mesoporous21,22 and hierarchical porous carbon materials23 usually show higher and more stability in CMD than microporous carbon
materials. The properties of raw coal greatly affect the catalytic
activity of coal-based activated carbons (ACs). Wei et al.24 studied the catalytic performance of AC from
raw coal of different ranks, and the results showed that coal coke
from low-rank coal had better catalytic activity. Bai et al.25 also believed that the catalytic activity of
lignite coke was better than that of bituminous coal and anthracite.
These results show that it is a feasible scheme to use appropriate
methods to pretreat raw coal so as to obtain suitable AC for methane
decomposition to hydrogen.

The thermal solution of solvent stood
out from many methods of
improving quality and utilization of coal because of its mild reaction
condition, high energy conversion rate, efficient multilevel utilization
of coal, and so on. However, in the process of thermal solution of
solvent, most researchers paid more attention to promoting the efficiency
of extraction and utilization of extraction. In fact, the resource
utilization of a large number of extraction residues is also a very
worthy research direction. Li et al.26 studied
the gasification performance of eight kinds of thermal solution upgrading
low-rank coal coke, and the results showed that the gasification performance
of thermal solution upgrading coal coke was better than that of raw
coal coke. Cai27 studied that thermal solution
upgrading coal was prepared from mesoporous carbon by using the method
of CO2 physical activation and KOH chemical activation.
The results showed that the surface area and pore volume of mesoporous
carbon prepared by the extracted residue were better than that prepared
by raw coal under the same condition. The mesoporosity of carbon materials
was the highest at 800 °C and a KOH/extracted residue mass ratio
of 2:1, and the highest specific surface area was 2100 m2/g. This showed that the thermal solution pretreatment of coal can
improve the interaction between the precursor and activator in the
carbonization and activation stage. However, there are few reports
on the influence of thermal solution pretreatment of coal on the surface
and chemical properties of ACs prepared at different temperatures
and catalytic methane decomposition to hydrogen.

In view of
this, the raw coal and extraction residue of raw coal
were used to prepare ACs at different activation temperatures. The
effects of thermal solution pretreatment on structure and surface
properties and reactivity of ACs for methane decomposition to hydrogen
were studied.

2 Experimental Section
2.1 Preparation and Thermal Solution of Coal Samples
Datong
raw coal (DT), a long-flame coal from China, was used as
the precursor. The DT was crushed, ground, and sieved to a size less
than 0.5 mm. Then, the DT was put into a vacuum drying oven (383 K)
for 2 h and subsequently gathered in a dryer for standby.

Five
grams of DT and 150 mL of benzene solvent were mixed and put into
a 500 mL high-pressure reaction kettle. The bolts of the reaction
kettle were fixed in, and then a certain amount of nitrogen atmosphere
was repeatedly accessed to the reaction kettle to discharge internal
air. A 4 MPa nitrogen atmosphere was injected in the kettle, and the
valve was closed. After the agitator blade was opened, the reaction
kettle was heated to 563 K at the heating rate of 5 K/min, and the
final pressure was kept at 9 MPa. When thermostatic mixing was up
to 2 h, the kettle was cooled to room temperature, and all thermal
extracted products were taken out. The thermal extracted products
were cleaned with ethanol solvent in a Soxhlet extractor. The liquid
products were separated by vacuum distillation to get the thermal
extracted oil and ethanol solvent. The solid products were washed
with hot water to get the thermal extracted residue of DT (RR). This
process was different from the existing thermal solution pretreatment
process.28 The following aspects were described:
(i) The selected temperature was lower than the temperature of the
general thermal solution process (633 K), which was before the pyrolysis
temperature of coal; (ii) benzene (Tc =
562.1 K, Pc = 4.83 MPa) was in a supercritical
state under the conditions of selected temperature and pressure; and
(iii) nearly all ash contents were retained in the RR because of its
positive role on the preparation of AC.29

2.2 Preparation of AC
DT or RR was mixed
with activator KOH (Tianjin Damao Chemical Reagent Factory) at a mass
ratio of 4:1. A certain amount of deionized water and ethanol were
added to the mixture and mechanically stirred in a crucible for 24
h. The crucible was placed in a vertical carbonization furnace, and
the nitrogen flow rate was set at 200 mL/min. The process of carbonization
was set as follows: the sample was heated from 298 to 473 K within
35 min and was held for 1 h. Then, it was sequentially heated to the
target temperatures (823, 923, 1023, and 1123 K) with a 5 K/min heating
rate and was held for 2 h. The reaction equipment was cooled to room
temperature with 50 mL/min nitrogen, and the AC was collected. The
carbonized material was soaked in 3 M hydrochloric acid for 24 h and
was mixed by a magnetic blender for 6 h. In the end, the AC was washed with
deionized water and filtered to neutral, and then it was dried under
423 K for 2 h. The AC was named as AC-T or AC-T-1, where T is the activation temperature,
and 1 represents the AC made from RR. For example, AC-823 meant the
AC prepared from DT at an activation temperature of 823 K; AC-823-1
meant the AC prepared by RR at an activation temperature of 823 K.

2.3 Structural Characterization of Activated Carbon
The structure properties of ACs were determined by an ASAP 2420
automatic nitrogen adsorption instrument at 77 K. The surface area
and pore structure information were calculated by BET (Brunauer–Emmett–Teller)
and BJH (Barrett–Joyner–Halenda) methods. The micropore
volume (Vmic) and microporosity were calculated
by the t-plot method and the ratio of Vmic to total pore volume (Vt), Vmic/Vt. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of ACs were measured by a
D/MAX-2400 X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation at 30 kV
and 30 mA. The surface functional group structures of the ACs were
measured by a Thermo Fisher Fourier transform infrared analysis spectrometer.
The properties of DT and RR were measured by industrial and elemental
analyzers. The element compositions of DT and RR were measured by
an XRF instrument of SR3400 type made in Germany. The surface morphology
of ACs was measured by a scanning electron microscope (Zeiss EV018).

2.4 Methane Cracking Reaction
The methane
cracking reaction was conducted in a vertical fixed-bed reactor at
1123 K and atmospheric pressure. First, 0.2 g of AC was filled in
the reactor, and then nitrogen atmosphere with a flow rate of 40 mL/min
was introduced and heated to 1123 K. The mixture gas of 10 mL/min
methane and 40 mL/min nitrogen was introduced to replace the pure
nitrogen. The total volume hourly space velocity were set at 15,000
mL/(h·gcat). The gas products were analyzed by an
online gas chromatograph (Techcomp, GC7890II) equipped with a thermal
conductivity detector running at 423 K (5 Å molecular sieve filled
column) and a hydrogen flame detector running at 373 K (GDX502 filled
column). Methane conversion and hydrogen productivity were calculated
by the following formulas: 1   2  where X, Y, F,
and m represent
the conversion rate of methane (%), hydrogen productivity (mmol/g·min),
gas flow rate (mmol/min), and catalyst mass (g), respectively.

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Effect of Thermal Solution
Pretreatment on
Properties of ACs at Different Activation Temperatures
When
DT was treated by the thermal solution of solvent, a certain amount
of thermal extraction oil and RR could be obtained. The thermal solubility
could reach 26.2%. The industrial analysis, elemental analysis, and
ash content analysis of DT and RR are shown in Table 1. Obviously, the volatiles and ash content
of RR decrease by 2.6 and 3.7%, respectively, and the content of fixed
carbon increases by 2.6%. The corresponding elemental analysis also
shows that the contents of carbon increase a little, but the content
of other elements decrease slightly. Ash analysis shows that all of
the main elements, such as Si, Al, Fe, Ca, and Mg, decrease slightly.
This shows that only a part of small molecules in RR is removed, and
the macromolecular structure in it rarely has been influenced. Most
of the ash has been retained in RR.

In order to further study the
effects of thermal solution pretreatment
on the ACs prepared by KOH activation, the ACs were prepared at different
carbonization temperatures (823, 923, 1023, and 1123 K) for DT and
RR. The yields of ACs prepared at different temperatures are shown
in Table 2. As can
be seen from Table 2, the yields of ACs produced by DT and RR at different temperatures
gradually decrease with the increase in temperature; especially, the
yields of AC-1123 and AC-1123-1 are only 30.8 and 7.14%, respectively.
This indicates that the thermal solution pretreatment of DT can make
the structure of coal looser, thus promote the reaction between activator
KOH and carbon elements, and increase the consumption of RR.

The structure and properties of ACs prepared at different
temperatures
are shown in Figure 1 and Table 2. As can
be seen from Figure 1, the isotherms of AC-823, AC-923, and AC-823-1 are nearly parallel
to the axis of P/P0,
which show that these samples are multi-microbore materials. The isotherms
of other ACs exhibit a type IV curve, which show that these samples
contain many mesoporous materials. The pore diameter profiles of ACs
show that the mesopores are mainly concentrated in 3–5 nm.
The pore structure parameters of ACs are shown in Table 2. It can be found that the specific
surface area and pore volume of AC-823-1, AC-923-1, and AC-1023-1
are higher than those of AC-823, AC-923, and AC-1023, while the specific
surface area and pore volume of AC-1123-1 are lower than those of
AC-1123. This indicates that thermal solution pretreatment can promote
the increase in specific surface area and pore volume of ACs. When
the temperature reaches 1123 K, excessive reaction can cause partial
pores of AC to collapse, resulting in the decrease in surface area
and pore volume. The Vmic/Vt of AC-823-1 and AC-1023-1 are higher than those of AC-823
and AC-1023, indicating that the thermal solution pretreatment mainly
promote the rising of micropores at 823 and 1023 K. However, the Vmic/Vt of AC-923-1
is lower than that of AC-923, indicating that the thermal solution
pretreatment mainly promote the rising of mesopores at 923 K. The Vmic/Vt of AC-1123-1
and AC-1123 are both 0, indicating that pores of AC-1123-1 and AC-1123
are all mesoporous. In summary, the thermal solution pretreatment
further promotes the opening pore of ACs at different temperatures,
and the distribution of pore has an important correlation with temperature.

Figure 1 N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms and the corresponding
pore size distributions of carbon prepared from the raw coal and thermal
extracted coal.

The infrared spectra of ACs prepared
at different temperatures
are shown in Figure 2. As can be seen from Figure 2, The ACs under the same carbonization condition have the
same kind of surface groups. The broad band from 3000 to 3400 cm–1 can be assigned to the O–H stretch for hydroxyl
groups. This band can be found at all samples; however, the intensities
of the bands in ACs prepared by RR decrease with increasing carbonization
temperature. This indicates that the contents of the hydroxyl groups
in DT could partially be removed by the thermal solution pretreatment.
The band at 2970 cm–1 can be attributed to C–H
symmetric and asymmetric stretching vibration. The intensity of the
bands in ACs prepared by RR is less. This indicates that the contents
of aliphatic groups in DT could be removed by the thermal solution
pretreatment. The broad band from 900 to 1300 cm–1 can be attributed to alcohol and phenolic C–O bond stretching
vibration and O–H bending vibration,30 and the intensities of the bands in ACs prepared by RR decrease
with increasing carbonization temperature. This indicates that the
contents of alcoholic and phenolic groups in DT could partially be
removed by the thermal solution pretreatment. In general, the bands
at 1660 and 1719 cm–1 are associated with C=O
and O–H stretching vibration,31 which
are the characteristic peaks for carboxylic acid functional groups.
The intensity of the band has a negligible change in all the samples.
The bands at 500–600, 1000–1100, and 3600–3700
cm–1 are attributed to the characteristic peaks
of minerals.32 However, the ACs do not
show these absorption peaks, indicating that the minerals in ACs are
mostly removed by hydrochloric acid in the preparation process. It
can be concluded that the thermal solution pretreatment may further
remove alcoholic and phenolic groups in DT, which leads to the decrease
in these groups in ACs prepared by RR at different temperatures. The
minerals in ACs are mostly removed by hydrochloric acid in the preparation
process.

Figure 2 Fourier transform infrared spectra of ACs from the raw coal and
thermal extracted coal.

The XRD patterns of ACs
prepared from DT and RR are shown in Figure 3. It is generally
believed that the peaks of carbon materials are 26° and 44°,
corresponding to the C(002) and C(101) crystal planes, respectively.
The intensity or area ratio of the two diffraction peaks reflects
the order degree of carbon graphite layers, and the lower ratio represents
the more ordered structure.14 The XRD peak
intensity C(101)/C(002) ratios of ACs prepared from DT and RR are
shown in Table 3. It can be seen that C(101)/C(002) ratios of AC-823-1 and AC-923-1
are lower than those of AC-823 and AC-923, indicating that the AC-823-1
and AC-923-1 have a higher graphitization degree and a more ordered
structure. The C(101)/C(002) ratio of AC-1023-1 is higher than that
of AC-1023, indicating that the AC-1023-1 has a lower degree of graphitization
and a more disordered structure. The C(101)/C(002) ratios of AC-1123-1
and AC-1123 are the same. In summary, it can be concluded that the
effect of thermal solution pretreatment on the crystal structure is
related with the carbonization temperature.

the raw coal and thermal extracted coal.

The SEM analysis of
ACs prepared by DT and RR at different temperatures
are shown in Figures 4 and 5, respectively. It is clearly observed
that the carbon layer of the ACs from RR becomes thinner as the carbonization
temperature increases, especially those of AC-923-1 and AC-1123-1
as seen in Figure 5b,d, which have almost hyaline morphological characteristics. The
surface of ACs from RR becomes bumpier than that of ACs from DT, which
may be caused by the consumption of carbon by the reaction between
coal and KOH.

3.2 Effect of Thermal Solution
Pretreatment on
Methane Decomposition to Hydrogen
The effect of thermal solution
pretreatment on the ACs for methane decomposition to hydrogen is shown
in Figure 6. It can
be found that ACs prepared by RR exhibit better catalytic stability
and initial activity than ACs prepared by DT. The initial methane
conversion has no direct relationship with the increasing surface
area of the ACs prepared by DT and RR at different carbonization temperatures
in this work. All the ACs prepared from RR have higher initial activity
than the ACs from DT at the same carbonization temperature; especially,
the highest initial activity is obtained on AC-823-1, which suggests
that the initial activity can be improved by the thermal solution
pretreatment of DT. As it is known, micropores are more easily blocked
by carbon deposits during the methane decomposition to hydrogen than
mesopores or macropores.17,21,33,34 The AC-1123-1 and AC-1123 that
have the highest mesoporous rate show the best stability among the
tested samples, further indicating that mesopores are beneficial to
more stable methane conversion. Although the properties of coal have
little changes when the coal is treated by the thermal solution of
solvent at 563 K (in Table 1), more mesopores and micropores in ACs prepared by RR can
be obtained. The increments of mesopores and micropores are associated with the carbonization temperature
(in Table 2). As shown
in Figure 6, for all
the ACs catalysts, the conversion of methane dramatically decreases
within 1 h, and the slope of descent in ACs prepared by RR at different
carbonization temperatures is higher than ACs prepared by DT. This
may be related to the consumption of oxygen groups on the carbon surface,
while the ACs prepared by RR contain fewer oxygen groups than ACs
prepared by DT (in Figure 2). During the metastable stage, the activity of catalysts
is mainly determined by the number of carbon defects. It is generally
considered that a lower degree of graphitization partly results in
the higher activity of resultant ACs. However, AC-823-1 and AC-923-1
have a higher degree of graphitization and show higher activity. This
could be caused by ACs containing more micropores and mesopores. The
metastable stage will become longer with the increasing mesoporosity,
indicating that the mesoporosity of ACs plays a dominant role in the
activity and stability. During this stage, the active centers of ACs
will not be covered quickly by the carbon deposition; thus, the activity
can be maintained during certain hours. As the reaction goes on, there
are more carbon deposition products, blocking the pores gradually.
This will result in the active centers covered; thus, the activity
of ACs gradually decreases as the reaction goes on. This indicates
that the thermal solution pretreatment has a positive influence on
the initial activity and the stability of ACs, which are associated
with the change of chemical properties and mesoporosity of ACs. The
time dependence of hydrogen production rate is similar to that for
methane conversion. This is mainly because the methane is mainly converted
to hydrogen and solid carbon, and only very small amounts of ethylene
and ethane are generated in the process of methane decomposition to
hydrogen for ACs.35 The selectivity of
hydrogen in this work is greater than 98%; thus, the change of the
hydrogen selectivity and the yield of ethane and ethylene are no longer
discussed.

decomposition over ACs from raw coal and thermal extracted coal at
different temperatures.

3.3 Carbon
Fiber Formation
The SEM analyses
of spent for ACs are shown in Figure 7. As can be seen from the figure, a certain amount
of octopus fibrous carbon appear on the surface of AC-823, AC-923,
and AC-1023, while a large amount of fibrous carbon appear on the
surface of AC-1123. A large amount of fibrous carbon appear on the
surface of AC-823-1, AC-923-1, and AC-1023-1, while a small amount
of octopus fibrous carbon appear on the surface of AC-1123-1. Generally,
fibrous carbon can be formed on the surface of metal catalyst during
the process of methane decomposition to hydrogen. The main reason
is that the driving force formed by the significant carbon concentration
gradient on the front and rear surfaces of metal particles made the
carbon deposit grow as fibers.36,37 However, it has been
rarely reported that carbon for methane decomposition to hydrogen
forms fibrous deposits on the surface. Some studies suggested that
residual minerals in carbon (generally 1–12 wt %) did not lead
to the formation of fibrous carbon deposits.14,36,38 Zhang et al.39,40 believed that
the low concentration of oxygen-containing functional groups on the
surface of carbon play a key role in the formation of fibrous carbon.
It can be seen from the above results that the amount of oxygen-containing
functional groups of ACs prepared by RR at different temperatures
decreases, resulting in more fibrous carbon on the surface of AC-823-1,
AC-923-1, and AC-1023-1. The amount of fibrous carbon produced on
the surface of AC-1123-1 is less than that on the surface of AC-1123,
which is possibly caused by the average pore size of AC-1123-1 becoming
larger.

4 Conclusions
The ACs were prepared from DT and RR at different carbonization
temperatures and used for methane decomposition to hydrogen. The amount
of oxygen functional groups in ACs prepared by RR is lower than that
in ACs prepared by DT, while the number of specific surface area and
mesoporous is higher. The ACs prepared by RR exhibit better catalytic
stability and initial activity than ACs prepared by DT. The AC-1123-1
and AC-1123 show the best reaction stability in the process of methane
decomposition to hydrogen, while AC-823-1 shows the highest initial
reaction activity. More carbon fibers appear on the ACs prepared by
the RR surface after the reaction (except for AC-1123-1).
