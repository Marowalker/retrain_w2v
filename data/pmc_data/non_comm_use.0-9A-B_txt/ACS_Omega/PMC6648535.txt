Designing efficient 2D-bismuth oxychloride
(BiOCl)/2D-g-C3N4 heterojunction photocatalysts
by the microwave-assisted
method was studied in this work using different amounts of BiOCl plates
coupled with g-C3N4 nanosheets. The effects
of coupling the 2D structure of g-C3N4 with
the 2D structure of BiOCl were systematically examined by scanning
electron microscopy (SEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, X-ray
diffraction, photoluminescence (PL), lifetime decay measurement, surface
charges of the samples at various pH conditions, and UV–vis
diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (UV–vis DRS). The prepared
photocatalysts were used for the degradation of amine-based pharmaceuticals,
and nizatidine was used as a model pollutant to evaluate the photocatalytic
activity. The UV–vis DRS and other optical properties indicated
the major effect of coupling of BiOCl with g-C3N4 into a 2D/2D structure. The results showed a narrowing in the band
gap energy of the composite form, whereas the PL and lifetime analysis
showed greater inhibition of the electron–hole recombination
process and slightly longer charge carrier lifetime. Accordingly,
the BiOCl/g-C3N4 composite samples exhibited
an enhancement in the photocatalytic performance, specifically for
the 10% BiOCl/g-C3N4 sample. Moreover, the zeta
potential of this sample at different pH values was evaluated to determine
the isoelectric point of the synthesized composite material. Consequently,
the pH was adjusted to match the isoelectric point of the complex
materials, which further enhanced the activity. Further degradation
of pharmaceuticals was studied under solar light irradiation, and
96% degradation was achieved within 30 min.

==== Body
1 Introduction
The research work nowadays
is oriented toward treatment of wastewater
and drinking water from various organic contamination, more specifically
from pharmaceuticals and personal care products.1−3 Amine-based
pharmaceuticals such as nizatidine, ranitidine, doxylamine, and carbinoxamine
have attracted most researchers’ attention because of the ability
of these compounds to produce toxic nitrogenous disinfection by-products
(NDMPs), which are formed during the disinfection step.4,5 Unfortunately, in conventional wastewater treatment some NDMPs have
been detected after applying commonly used oxidants such as chlorine,
chlorine dioxide, and potassium permanganate.6−8 However, most
of the recent studies focused on the occurrence of NDMP compounds
and the potential risk on the environment resulting from such compounds.9−11 On the other hand, only few studies have been undertaken photocatalytic
degradation of amine-based pharmaceuticals as an alternative way of
wastewater treatment.12,13

The field of semiconductor
photocatalysis has emerged as an innovative
technology for application in many important fields such as water
purification, environmental remediation, hydrogen evolution, optical
sensing devices, energy harvesting, and storing devices.14−17 The idea of utilizing the abundantly available solar radiation for
driving important chemical reactions has potential for large-scale
industrial applications. Different types of semiconductor photocatalysts
such as oxynitrides, sulphides, oxides, and metal-free semiconductors
have been investigated.18−21

The main issue with the excising photocatalysis
materials can be
summarized in two points; (1) possible use of the full solar spectrum,
including the UV region along with the visible region and (2) the
high recombination rate of photogenerated electrons and holes, which
limit the reaction efficiency.22−27 One way to utilize the full solar spectrum is a fabrication of heterojunction
materials by coupling two semiconductors with compatible band energy
potentials, which allows the overlapping of conduction bands and valence
bands of both materials, resulting in an enhancement in the light
absorption and photocatalytic activity.28,29 The introduction
of 2D/2D layered semiconductors is known as an effective way for separation
of the charge carriers because of a larger contact surface.30−32 It is relatively hard for TiO2 and ZnO to control the
morphology of these photocatalyst nanoparticles. Therefore, bismuth
oxychloride (BiOCl) is a very attractive catalyst as it can be synthesized
in different morphologies and sizes. BiOCl has a band gap energy of
3.4 eV and responds to UV irradiation.33−35 Recently, different
structures of BiOCl have been reported such as spheres, plates, and
flower-like structures.36−39 Wang et al. reported the use of g-C3N4 for water splitting under visible light irradiation.40 g-C3N4 has a band gap
of 2.7 eV, indicating that its visible light active.41,42 g-C3N4 exhibits the needed excellent properties.43−45 However, it suffers from a rapid recombination rate, which reduces
the overall efficiency.46,47

Therefore, the
2D/2D stacked BiOCl/g-C3N4 composite material
is a very attractive catalyst from both experimental
and theoretical aspects.48 To date, only
a few studies have demonstrated the synthesis of the BiOCl/g-C3N4 composite material via different methods such
as hydrothermal, solvothermal, ionic-liquid, and hydrolysis route
where the prepared samples have been used mainly for the degradation
of dyes such as rhodamine B, methyl orange, and methylene blue. Compared
to the mentioned preparation methods, the microwave-assisted method
dramatically reduces the experimental time and enhances product purity.49,50 To the best of our knowledge, the synthesis of the 2D/2D BiOCl/g-C3N4 composite material via microwave-assisted technique
for the degradation of an amine-based pharmaceutical such as nizatidine
has never been reported.

In this study, we demonstrate a microwave-assisted
method for the
synthesis of 2D/2D BiOCl/g-C3N4 nanocomposite
material. The amount of BiOCl attached to the g-C3N4 sheets was investigated by varying the percentage of BiOCl
from 0% up to 50% (pure g-C3N4, 10% BiOCl/g-C3N4, 30% BiOCl/g-C3N4, 50%
BiOCl/g-C3N4, and pure BiOCl). The resulting
samples were examined by X-ray diffraction (XRD), field emission scanning
electron microscopy (FESEM), UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy
(UV–vis DRS), photoluminescence (PL), and time-resolved PL.
The photocatalytic performance of the photocatalysts was evaluated
by degradation of an amine-based pharmaceutical, nizatidine. Surface
charges of the samples were explored through pH adjustment for better
photocatalytic performance.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 XRD Analysis
The crystalline properties
of the prepared BiOCl, g-C3N4, and various BiOCl/g-C3N4 composite samples were investigated by XRD.
The XRD pattern of the obtained samples is shown in Figure 1. The g-C3N4 sample had two unique diffraction peaks at 13.1° and
27.4° corresponding to the (100) and (002) planes of g-C3N4, respectively. The BiOCl sample peaks were indexed
to the tetragonal crystal phase with diffraction peaks obtained at
2θ values of 11.98°, 24.10°, 25.86°, 32.50°,
33.45°, 40.90°, 46.64°, 49.70°, 54.10°, 55.12°,
and 58.60° which correspond to the respective miller indices
of (001), (002), (101), (110), (102), (112), (200), (113), (211),
(104), and (212) planes, respectively. All results perfectly matched
with previously reported studies51 (JCPDS
card no. 006-0249). For the prepared BiOCl/g-C3N4 composite structure, the diffraction peaks of BiOCl are clearly
observable, as well as the typical peak for g-C3N4 (002), indicating the coupling between BiOCl and g-C3N4 where the intensity of the (002) diffraction peak decreased
along with the increasing number of BiOCl microplates on the surface
of g-C3N4. Moreover, the grain sizes of the
synthesized structures were measured using the Maud Software with
Cif card number 1011175.52 For BiOCl sample,
the space group and lattice parameters of the samples were P4/nmm, a = b = 3.89 Å, c = 7.37 Å, and α = β
= γ = 90° and the grain sizes of 94.6, 90.1, 60.1, and
51.8 nm were found for pure BiOCl, 50% BiOCl/g-C3N4, 30% BiOCl/g-C3N4, and 10% BiOCl/g-C3N4 samples, respectively. The decrease in grain
size values could be attributed to the presence of a limited concentration
of a BiOCl precursor preventing further growth of the microplate.
It was also observed that no other peaks are identified in XRD patterns,
indicating the high purity of the BiOCl/g-C3N4 heterostructure.

samples.

2.2 UV–Vis
DRS Spectra and Band Gap Analysis
The UV–vis diffuse
reflectance spectra of the synthesized
samples are shown in Figure 2a. From the figure, the absorption edge of BiOCl sample was
approximately 364 nm, which is in the UV range, whereas the fundamental
absorption edge of the g-C3N4 material was about
450 nm, which is considered to be in the visible light range. Moreover,
the coupling of the BiOCl sample with g-C3N4 showed a red shift of the band edge absorption up to 476 nm, which
is expected to enhance the visible light photocatalytic performance
of the heterostructure. The optical band gap was calculated according
to the following Tauc equation53  where α, ν, A, and Eg are the absorption coefficient,
light frequency, proportionality constant, and band gap, respectively,
where the n value is equivalent to 4 because of the
essential absorption of both g-C3N4 and BiOCl
in an indirect transition between bands.54 Therefore, the band gap energy is estimated from the slope drawn
near to the band edge of (αhν)1/2 versus hν plots as shown in Figure 2b. The band gap values for
BiOCl, g-C3N4, 50% BiOCl/g-C3N4, 30% BiOCl/g-C3N4, and 10% BiOCl/g-C3N4 samples were 3.40, 2.76, 2.77, 2.70, and 2.60
eV, respectively. All composite forms of BiOCl/g-C3N4 showed lower band gap values when compared to pure BiOCl.
Moreover, the 10% BiOCl/g-C3N4 sample exhibited
a smaller band gap value compared to all samples including g-C3N4. This observation could point to the sufficient
overlapping of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of g-C3N4 and the conduction band of BiOCl shorting the
initial band gap values of each g-C3N4 and BiOCl
separately.30,55

2.3 Scanning Electron Microscopy and EDS Analysis
The morphologies of g-C3N4, BiOCl, and BiOCl/g-C3N4 samples prepared by the microwave-assisted method
were determined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Figure 3a,b shows the SEM images of
pure g-C3N4 and pure BiOCl samples. The g-C3N4 image shows sheet-like microstructures, whereas
the BiOCl product consists of a microplate structure. Moreover, the
fabrication of BiOCl in the presence of g-C3N4 does not change the microplate structure of BiOCl obtained in the
absence of g-C3N4 (Figure 3c–e). The number of BiOCl microplates
on the surface of the g-C3N4 sheet increased
because of increase in the percentage of the BiOCl precursor from
10% up to 50%. However, the 2D/2D type of composite is expected to
enhance the photocatalytic performance of the material because of
increased area of interaction.48 In order
to study the elemental distribution of BiOCl particles on the surface
of g-C3N4 sheets, the elemental mapping analysis
was performed as shown in Figure 4a. Quantitative analysis of the scanned area revealed
a concentrated presence of Bi, O, and Cl, whereas the BiOCl particles
were located as shown in Figure 4b–d and the presence of C and N was spread all
over the scanned area as shown in Figure 4e,f. Moreover, the elemental composition
of the prepared heterostructure sample was measured by energy-dispersive
X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) analysis (Figure 5a). It is observed that the sample was composed
mainly of five main elements: carbon, nitrogen, bismuth, oxygen, and
chlorine. The atomic ratios of Bi/O/Cl/C/N were 9.5:3.5:1.2 wt %:45:40.8.
These results further confirm the high purity of the produced BiOCl/g-C3N4 structure. The particle size distribution of
BiOCl is shown in Figure 5b, and the average particle size was about 0.25 μm.

2.4 Optical Properties
The PL emission
peak is mainly considered to result from the recombination process
of the photogenerated electrons and holes pairs. In general, increase
in PL emission peak intensity indicates a higher recombination rate
for photogenerated electrons and holes.56,57Figure 6a shows the PL emission spectra
of g-C3N4, BiOCl, and BiOCl/g-C3N4 composite samples. All samples were exposed to an excitation
process at a wavelength of a 370 nm at room temperature and the main
emission peak observed at about 450 nm. For the BiOCl sample, no emission
peak was detected because of insufficient excitation energy for such
a high band gap energy sample (3.4 eV). For the other samples, the
PL intensities of g-C3N4 reduced dramatically
after coupling it with BiOCl plates, indicating the inhabitation of
the recombination process of free charge carriers in the heterostructure
samples. Moreover, the 10% BiOCl/g-C3N4 and
30% BiOCl/g-C3N4 showed the lowest PL peak intensity
when compared to other samples. Time-resolved PL measurement was performed
in order to understand the photogenerated recombination process. The
fitting of the normalized decay curves is shown in Figure 6b. The average fluorescence
lifetime results of g-C3N4, 10% BiOCl/g-C3N4, 30% BiOCl/g-C3N4, and
50% BiOCl/g-C3N4 samples were 3.13, 3.95, 3.59,
and 3.14 ns respectively. The 10% BiOCl/g-C3N4 sample showed a longer charge carrier lifetime compared to other
samples. This enhancement in lifetime can be attributed to the formation
of BiOCl/g-C3N4 heterojunction, which prevent
fast photogenerated electrons and holes recombination.

samples; (b) time-resolved fluorescence
decay spectra of the obtained sample.

2.5 Isoelectric Point
Knowing the isoelectric
point of photocatalysis is a very important factor to determine the
electrostatic interaction behavior between the catalyst and the pollutant.58 The isoelectric point could be determined by
varying the pH value of photocatalyst suspension where the pH value
resulting in the zero net charge of the photocatalyst is known as
the isoelectric point. Thus, in order to check the surface charges
of the obtained samples, their zeta potentials were analyzed. The
zeta potentials of BiOCl, g-C3N4, and 10% BiOCl/g-C3N4 were −4.56, −24.08, and −21.34
mV, respectively. The zeta potential values of BiOCl, g-C3N4, and 10% BiOCl/g-C3N4 as a function
of pH values are shown in Figure 7. As observed, the measured potential continuously
declined with an increase in pH. The isoelectric points of BiOCl,
g-C3N4, and 10% BiOCl/g-C3N4 were observed at pH values 3.84, 3.62, and 3.72, respectively. Moreover,
Dumanović et al., reported that the protonation process of
nizatidine occurs in neutral media at a pH value of 5–8.59 The pH of the resulting solution after mixing
nizatidine with water was 5.6. Therefore, all prepared samples were
negatively charged at the time of the experiment.

pH.

2.6 Photocatalytic
Activity Studies
The
degradation of nizatidine using the BiOCl/g-C3N4 composite was investigated primarily under a light-emitting diode
(LED) single wavelength (365 nm) light irradiation. The degradation
profile of nizatidine was followed with the help of a UV–vis
spectrophotometer as shown in Figure 8a. Figure 8b represents the concentration changes of nizatidine concentration
with time starting from an initial concentration of 5 mg/L of the
nizatidine aqueous solution at pH = 5.6. Moreover, a control experiment
was performed to check the effect of the LED light on the pharmaceutical
compound in the absence of the prepared catalyst. The initial concentration
remained almost the same in the absence of the catalyst, indicating
that nizatidine is very photostable. However, the degradation was
dramatically enhanced after the addition of the prepared catalyst.
Among the prepared samples, the pure BiOCl and pure g-C3N4 samples showed the lowest degradation performance.
As expected, the BiOCl/g-C3N4 composite samples
exhibited superior photocatalytic performance. The 10% BiOCl/g-C3N4 showed the best performance among all the prepared
samples. The enhancement noticed for the 10% BiOCl/g-C3N4 sample could be attributed to the coupling of the two
semiconductors, which results in the narrowing of the band gap energy
along with an effective separation of the charge carriers as shown
in UV–vis DRS and PL results. Moreover, the photocatalytic
performance was further enhanced by adjusting the pH from 5.6 to 3.7
to reach an IEP of the 10% BiOCl/g-C3N4 sample
as estimated from zeta potential results in Figure 8c. This further enhancement may be attributed
to the improved interaction obtained between nizatidine and the 10%
BiOCl/g-C3N4 catalyst. To confirm the above
statement, another experiment was carried out at pH 10. At a higher
pH, the photocatalytic performance of 10% BiOCl/g-C3N4 dropped down, which was expected because at a higher pH level
the catalyst and the pollutant are negatively charged, resulting in
a poor interaction.59 A final test was
performed under natural solar irradiation and the degradation dramatically
increased to reach 96% within 30 min compared to the LED 365 nm of
120 min (Figure 8d).
Finally, to investigate the stability of the 10% BiOCl/g-C3N4 sample, the photodegradation experiment was repeated
five times under the same conditions. After each cycle, the sample
was washed then collected and kept to dry overnight in an oven for
the next run. Compared to the fresh sample, the recycled samples showed
an acceptable stability in nizatidine degradation. Figure 9 shows that the photodegradation
efficiencies of 10% BiOCl/g-C3N4 remained almost
the same after the second cycle. A schematic diagram of the proposed
mechanism for the degradation of nizatidine on the surface of the
BiOCl/g-C3N4 sample under solar light irradiation
is shown in Figure 10. Photoexcited electrons from the conduction band (CB) of g-C3N4 are transferred to the CB of BiOCl upon irradiation.
The electrons can reduce the surface-absorbed O2 to form
a superoxide radical (•O2–) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and these new
species can interact to yield a highly oxidizing hydroxyl radical
(•OH). On the other hand, holes remaining in g-C3N4 can react with surface-absorbed H2O to generate more •OH, enhancing the photoactivity.
The radicals can oxidize the nizatidine to their intermediates and
then eventually to CO2, water, and some other mineralized
species.

3 Conclusions
In summary, the 2D-BiOCl/2D-C3N4 heterojunction
composite photocatalytic materials were successfully synthesized by
the microwave-assisted method. The results from SEM, EDX, UV–vis
DRS, XRD, PL, lifetime decay, and surface charges measurement indicated
that the selected method reduces experimental synthesis time down
to 1 h and enhances the product purity compared to other techniques.
The photocatalytic tests of the prepared samples showed high efficiency
for the degradation of nizatidine as an amine-based pharmaceutical
model under solar light irradiation. The sample with 10% BiOCl to
g-C3N4 ratio showed the highest photocatalytic
activity. The degradation under solar irradiation reached 96% within
30 min. Moreover, the prepared composite showed reasonable stability
after the second run of recycling. Therefore, applying the 10% BiOCl/g-C3N4 for the degradation of the amine-based pharmaceutical
can be taken into consideration as an alternative method for removal
of such pollutants during water treatment.

4 Experimental
Section
4.1 Materials and Methods
The g-C3N4 samples were prepared by using melamine powder
(M2659 ALDRICH). Analytical grade bismuth nitrate pentahydrate Bi(NO3)3·5H2O, 98%, nitric acid HNO3, 99%, and potassium chloride KCl, 99%, were purchased from
Sigma-Aldrich and were used without further purification for the preparation
of BiOCl. The g-C3N4 synthesis was done in a
muffle furnace by directly heating melamine powder in a semi-closed
system. One gram of melamine powder was placed into an alumina crucible
and covered with a lid and then direct heating was applied by increasing
the temperature to 550 °C at a heating rate of 20 °C/min
for 3 h. The BiOCl/g-C3N4 composite samples
were prepared through the microwave-assisted technique. BiOCl/g-C3N4 samples with three wt % ratios were prepared,
which were 10, 30 and 50% (wt %/wt). In a typical procedure for preparing
the BiOCl/g-C3N4 composite, 0.2 g of g-C3N4 powder was dispersed in 40 mL of DI water and
sonicated for 30 min and then depending upon the percentage, different
amounts of Bi(NO3)3·5H2O and
KCl were mixed and stirred for 2 h. The obtained solution was transferred
into a microwave vessel and the microwave was maintained at 110 °C
with a heating rate of 3 °C/min for 1 h. The product was then
washed with water and ethanol. The pure BiOCl sample was obtained
by the same method without g-C3N4.

4.2 Characterization
The crystal phases
of all the samples were examined by XRD analysis using a MiniFlex600
X-ray diffractometer with graphite monochromatized Cu Kα radiation
(λ = 1.540 Å) source. The sample morphologies were checked
using a field emission scanning electron microscope (JSM-7800F JOEL,
Japan) with a maximum working voltage of 30 kV, maximum resolution
of 0.8 nm, and a working distance of 10 mm being used during measurements.
UV–vis DRS measurements were conducted using the PerkinElmer
Lambda 650S spectrometer. PL behavior was evaluated using a PerkinElmer
LS 55 Luminescence Spectrometer. Lifetime decay measurement was done
with help of EasyLife X equipped with 380 nm nanosecond pulsed LED’s.
The surface charges of the samples at various pH conditions were measured
by a Photal Otsuka Electronics.

4.3 Photocatalytic
Activity Studies
Nizatidine
is an amine-based pharmaceutical. It was chosen as a model pollutant
to test the photocatalytic activity of the prepared samples. All photodegradation
reaction experiments were carried out in a photocatalytic reactor
batch system consisting of a cylindrical borosilicate glass reactor
vessel with an effective volume of 500 mL. The experiment was carried
out in the open atmosphere with an air diffuser fixed at the reactor
to uniformly disperse oxygen into the solution. The reaction suspensions
were prepared by adding 0.1 g of the prepared sample in 250 mL of
aqueous nizatidine solution (0.4 mg/mL), with an initial concentration
of 5 mg/L. The aqueous suspension was then irradiated with Mic-LED-365
(from Prizmatix 420 mW with an average intensity 13.37 W/m2). Prior to illumination, the reaction suspensions were magnetically
stirred for 30 min in the dark to ensure adsorption–desorption
equilibrium between the photocatalyst and nizatidine. Upon illumination,
6 mL aliquots of suspension were taken from the reactor at scheduled
time intervals. The sample was centrifuged at 8000 revolutions per
minute (rpm) for 5 min and then filtered to remove the catalyst. The
filtrate was analyzed on the UV–vis spectrophotometer to evaluate
the degradation of nizatidine.
