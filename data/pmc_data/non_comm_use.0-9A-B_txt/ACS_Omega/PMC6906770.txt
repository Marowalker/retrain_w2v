Modifications at the carbohydrate moiety of neoandrographolide,
isolated from the medicinal plant Andrographis paniculata, result in more potent and less toxic derivatives, namely, 4′,6′-benzylidene
neoandrographolide (2b) and 4′6′-p-methoxybenzylidene neoandrographolide (2c). These showed improved cytotoxicity against SW-620, PC-3, and A549
cancer cell lines. Nuclear morphology studies were conducted on compound 2b by 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylidole staining and detection
of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation. It showed
an increase in the generation of cellular and mitochondrial ROS level.
The probable relation of B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2, an apoptosis inhibitor)
to B-cell lymphoma-2-associated X protein (Bax, an apoptosis promoter)
ratio with caspase-3 (apoptosis coordination enzyme) in the colon
cancer cell line SW-620 was investigated, and it was discovered that
upon 2b treatment, the expression of caspase-3 Bax increased
remarkably. However, in 2b-treated cells, the expression
of Bcl-2 was downregulated as compared to untreated cells.

1 Introduction
Biological mechanisms in normal as well as pathogenic cells are
being governed to a large extent by reactive oxygen species (ROS).
These species which include superoxide (O2•), nitroxyl radical (NO•), hydroxyl (•OH), alkoxyl (•OR), peroxyl (ROO•), and so forth act as chemical messengers and are fatal factors
for DNA and proteins.1 In normal conditions,
ROS are generated through different endogenous or exogenous ways and
then abolished by antioxidant systems to regulate cellular homeostasis.
Strangely, mitochondria functions as a production place (mitochondrial
electron transport chain) as well as a target of ROS. The sources
of ROS also include xanthine oxidase, cytochrome P450, lipoxygenases,
and NADPH oxidases (NOX) which are endogenous and are considered essential.
In malignant cells, oxidative stress-mediated signaling phenomenon
influences the cell behavior. The progression of cell cycle, cell
survival and apoptosis, proliferation, cell morphology, cell motility,
energy metabolism, angiogenesis, and tumor maintenance includes the
involvement of ROS in neoplasm.2 Natural
products have been used as significant and potent antineoplastic entities
for a long time, and carbohydrate units adjoining a natural compound
change the biocompatible properties of that molecule, such as the
cardiac glycoside, etoposide (glycoside of podophyllotoxin with a d-glucose derivative). It has been proved that carbohydrate
modification can make a remarkable change in the activity of the bioactive
molecule. Similar outcomes were observed with the glucoside modifications
in the labdane diterpenoid neoandrographolide.

An ethnopharmacologically important plant, Andrographis
paniculata (commonly known as king of bitters, Kalmegh,and Chirait), is a rich source of labdane diterpenoids,3,4 viz.,
andrographolide followed by neoandrographolide and 14-deoxy-11,12-didehydroandrographolide.
Although medicinal chemistry of andrographolide is well explored,5−10 limited information is available on the semisynthetic studies of
the second-principle phytoconstituent, neoandrographolide.11 Therefore, during the present investigation,
neoandrographolide was isolated from A. paniculata followed by the synthesis of its semisynthetic derivatives, and
their cytotoxic potential was explored.

Neoandrographolide is a labdaneglucoside with molecular formula
C26H40O8, molecular mass of 480.597,
and has a melting point of 165–166 °C. Its structure is
a C19-O-β-d-glucopyranoside diterpene
with an α,β-unsaturated lactone.12 The biosynthesis of neoandrographolide is reported via glucosyltransferase
(ApUGT)-catalyzed 19-O-glucosylation of andrograpanin.13 It is soluble in methanol, ethanol, propanol,
acetone, pyridine, and acetic acid. It is reported to be more a potent
anti-inflammatory metabolite than andrographolide.14 The current investigation was carried out to isolate neoandrographolide
from the aerial parts of A. paniculata and to carry out carbohydrate modifications in it. The effect of
the modified neoandrographolide was studied against different cancer
cell lines. Its benzylidene derivatives 2b and 2c were shown to have more drug-like properties, with more
potency and less toxicity than the parent molecule against the cell
lines SW-620 and PC-3, respectively. Also, these compounds were found
to be more biofriendly than the promising natural product andrographolide
reported from the genus Andrographis. The molecules 2b and 2c were found to
induce apoptosis on SW-620 cells via the mitochondria-dependent pathway
mediated by ROS. In the present study, the molecules 2b and 2c were found to have subsided mitochondrial membrane
potential and increased ROS generation in colon cancer cell lines,
leading to apoptosis via the Bax-/Bcl-2-dependent apoptosis pathway.
The third most common cause of neoplastic morbidity and mortality
is the colon cancer. Therefore, we emphasize the execution of naturally
derived biocompatible molecules on the lethal cell line SW-620.

2 Results and Discussion
In the current study, 128 g (5.1%) of methanolic extract was obtained
from shed, air-dried shoot plant material (2.5 kg) of A. paniculata. The extract was subjected to liquid–liquid
partition, subsequently with hexane–methanol and dichloromethane–methanol
solvents. Neoandrographolide (0.1%) was isolated as white needle-like
crystals with mp 174–75 °C. It is chemically identified
as ent-19-hydroxy-8(17),13-labdadien-16,15-olide
19-O-β-d-glucopyranoside.

The sugar residue of the isolated labdane glucoside diterpene was
subjected to acetonide protection, following the method reported previously,15 and the ester protection was done in the presence
of a base (Scheme 1). 4′,6′-Diol-protected neoandrographolides were confirmed
by their spectral analysis. In the 1H nuclear magnetic
resonance (NMR) spectrum of benzylidene derivative, a peak near δ
5.1 ppm was assigned to acetal proton, and the peak at δ 101.88
ppm in 13C NMR belongs to acetal carbon. The tetraacetate
derivative was characterized by four signals between δ 170.7
and 169 ppm (four acetate carbonyl carbons) in its 13C
NMR spectrum. In the 1H NMR spectrum of the tetrabenzoate
derivative, twenty aromatic protons appeared at δ 8.03–7.29
ppm as multiplets and four benzoate carbonyl carbons were displayed
between 166.12 and 165.00 ppm in its 13C NMR spectrum.

The anticancer activity of the parent compound and its derivatives
was investigated against three human cancer cell lines PC-3 (prostate),
SW-620 (colon), and A549 (lung) as well as in normal cell lines. Among
seven molecules, two compounds, 4′,6′-benzylidene neoandrographolide
(2b) and 4′6′-p-methoxybenzylidene
neoandrographolide (2c), were found to show effective
cytotoxic activity against the three human cancer cell lines. The
IC50 value of compound 2b against PC-3, A549,
and SW-620 was 6.2, 2.65, and 1.75, respectively, and IC50 of compound 2c against these three cancer cell lines
was 4.65, 9.91, and 7.52, respectively (Table 1).

The ester protection of the hydroxyl groups of carbohydrate moiety
does not show significant activity, whereas the acetonides were found
to have good bioactivity. Compounds 2b and 2c (4′,6′-benzylidene neoandrographolide and 4′,6′-p-methoxybenzylidene neoandrographolide) were found to be
more potent against the SW-620, PC-3, and A549 cell lines than the
other derivatives.

In nuclear morphology study, it was observed that 2b induced nuclear fragmentation as the concentration advanced (Figure 1). To assess the
molecular mechanism of the molecule imposing apoptosis in SW-620 colon
cancer cells, the mitochondrial effect of 2b on SW-620
cells was assessed by examining the accumulation of cellular ROS.
In SW-620 cells, ROS production was induced by 2b which
appeared to play a critical role in the induction of apoptotic cell
death in a dose-dependent manner agreeable with the increase in concentration.
ROS production was also induced by cells exposed to H2O2 which were used as a positive control (Figure 2).

Figure 1 Nuclear fragmentation was observed with membrane blebbing (E,F)
at various concentrations of 2b (C–F) compared
to untreated control (A) cells that remain intact, with no blebbing
and fragmentation. Paclitaxel was used as a positive control (B).

Figure 2 Generation of increased level of ROS by 2b (E,F) in
a concentration-dependent manner (C–F) leading to apoptosis
in SW-620 cells as compared with H2O2 (B), a
major contributor to oxidative damage, whereas no significant change
of fluorescence was observed in control cells (A), indicating the
selective targeting of 2b in liberating ROS in SW-620
colon cancer cells and not in the control cells. Mean ± SD, n = 3,***P < 0.001.

MitoSOX Red fluorescence was used to confirm that mitochondria
were crucial sites of ROS production in SW-620 cells. It recognizes
superoxide synthesis to quantify mitochondrial ROS (Figure 3). It was found that an increase
in the concentration of 2b increased the production of
mitochondrial superoxide. In addition, 2b significantly
inhibited mitochondrial ROS generation in SW-620 cells as compared
to the positive control. These observations confirmed that 2b plays a pivotal role in mitochondria-derived ROS-induced apoptosis.
Also, with the increase in the concentration of 2b, the
antiapoptotic Bcl-2 and proapoptotic Bax protein expressions in SW-620
cells were found to be decreased and increased, respectively. Furthermore,
preincubation with 2b significantly increased the activation
of caspase-3/7 compared to the control cells, which concluded an enhancement
in the rate of apoptotic proteins (Figure 4).

Figure 3 2b increased mitochondrial superoxide production (A,B):
SW-620 cells were incubated at the indicated concentration of 2b and incubated with MitoSOX Red for 20 min and then analyzed
by a fluorescence microscope. Significant decrease in fluorescence
intensity (C–F), indicative of superoxide production, was detected
in SW-620 cells compared with the control cells. Mean ± SD, n = 3, **P < 0.01 ***P < 0.001.

3 Experimental Section
3.1 Instrumentation and Chemicals
The
commercially available reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich
and solvents from SD Fine Chemicals. Melting point was measured on
a Perfit melting point apparatus. The progression of reaction and
purity of final products were monitored on silica gel-precoated aluminum
sheets (60F254, Merck).The spots on thin-layer chromatography (TLC)
plates were visualized by exposure to ultraviolet (UV) light at 254
nm, iodine vapors, and 1% cerric ammonium sulfate in water containing
30% H2SO4 (by volume). Column chromatography
was executed on silica gel (60–120 mesh). IR spectra were recorded
on a PerkinElmer spectrophotometer. Tetramethylsilane was used as
an internal standard to record 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra on a Bruker AC-400 spectrometer. Liquid chromatography/mass
spectrometry (LC/MS) analysis was performed on an Agilent 6410 LC/MS–MS
(Agilent Technologies, USA).

3.2 Plant Material
A.
paniculata was procured from the experimental plots
of School of Biotechnology, University of Jammu. The plant material
was taxonomically identified, accessioned, and deposited in the herbarium
of Department of Botany, University of Jammu, for future reference
(accession number: 15796).

3.3 Preparation of Methanolic (MeOH) Extract
Fresh shoot parts (about 8 kg) of A. paniculata were collected, cleaned, air-dried, and crushed to powdered form
(2.5 kg, 31.2%). Extraction of the powdered plant material was done
in double-distilled methanol (5 L) at room temperature (RT) for 24
h, filtered, and evaporated under a reduced pressure (Buchi Rotary
Evaporator, R-210). The filtrate was evaporated and combined.

3.4 Isolation of Neoandrographolide
The
methanolic extract was defatted by liquid–liquid partition
(three times) with hexane and methanol. After concentration, the methanol
extract was extracted with dichloromethane and finally subjected to
column chromatography on a 60–120 mesh silica gel using dichloromethane–methanol
as the solvent system.16 A 2.5 g (0.1%)
neoandrographolide was isolated from 5% methanol in dichloromethane
fraction. Colorless crystals (mp 165–166 °C) were obtained
after subjecting it to crystallization in ethanol.

3.5 General Procedure for the Semisynthesis of
Neoandrographolide Analogues
3.5.1 4′,6′-Isopropylidene Neoandrographolide
(2a)
Neoandrographolide (48.0 mg, 0.1 mmol),
2,2-dimethoxypropane (14.70 μL, 0.12 mmol), and camphor sulfonic
acid catalyst (1.16 mg, 0,005 mmol) were dissolved in a 1:5 mixture
of dry dimethylformamide and dry toluene. The reaction was carried
out under a nitrogen atmosphere at RT. The progress of the reaction
was monitored over TLC. After the completion of the reaction (4 h),
toluene was evaporated on a rotary evaporator and the content was
diluted with ethyl acetate (15 mL). The reaction mixture was treated
with a saturated sodium bicarbonate solution (5 mL) and water (5 mL)
to quench the remaining catalyst and was then extracted with ethyl
acetate (10 mL × 3). The organic layers were collected followed
by drying over anhydrous sodium sulfate and were concentrated on the
rotary evaporator. The concentrated mass obtained was subjected to
column chromatography over silica (60–120 mesh). Hexane/ethyl
acetate (1:1) was used as an eluant to obtain 4′,6′-isopropylidene
neoandrographolide with 85% yield (44 mg).

3.5.2 4′,6′-Benzylidene Neoandrographolide
(2b) and 4′,6′-p-Methoxybenzylidene
Neoandrographolide (2c)
4′,6′-Benzylidene
neoandrographolide (50.1 mg, 88% yield) and 4′,6′-p-methoxybenzylidene neoandrographolide (51.5 mg, 86% yield)
were obtained with benzaldehyde dimethyl acetal(18 μL, 0.12
mmol) and p-methoxybenzaldehyde dimethyl acetal(20
μL, 0.12 mmol), respectively, using the same procedure as mentioned
above (Scheme 2).15

3.5.3 Tetraacetate Neoandrographolide (3)
Acetic anhydride (19 μL, 0.2 mmol) and a catalytic
amount of dimethylaminopyridine  (1.2 mg, 0.01 mmol) were added
at RT1 to neoandrographolide (48.0 mg,
0.1 mmol) in pyridine (9.66 μL, 0.12 mmol).17 After the completion (3–4 h) of the reaction, which
was checked using TLC, it was extracted with ethyl acetate. Pyridine
was quenched with CuSO4 solution. The resultant, after
column chromatography over silica (60–120 mesh), yielded tetraacetate
neoandrographolide with a yield of 76% using the solvent system hexane:ethyl
acetate (7:3) as the eluent (Scheme 3).

Scheme 4 Synthesis of Tetrabenzoate Neoandrographolide from Neoandrographolide
3.5.4 Tetrabenzoate Neoandrographolide (4)
For benzoylation reaction,18 benzoyl chloride (55.8 μL, 0.48 mmol) was added dropwise
at 0 °C to a stirred solution of neoandrographolide (48.0 mg,
0.1 mmol) in 1 mL dichloromethane and triethylamine (67 μL,
0.48 mmol). After the completion (3–4 h) of the reaction, it
was concentrated under reduced pressure. Tetrabenzoate neoandrographolide
was yielded (yield 68%) from the resultant, after column chromatography
over silica (60–120 mesh), using the solvent system hexane:ethylacetate
(6:4) as the eluant (Scheme 4).

3.7 Biological Screening Methodology
3.7.1 Sulforhodamine B Assay
The assay
was performed by seeding a cell suspension of favorable cell density
in 96-well flat-bottom plates (NUNC). Cell densities for each well
used in the screen for SW-620-10, 000, A549-7000 and PC-3-7000, 100
μL of cell/well was plated. The cells were then incubated for
48 h and exposed to various concentrations of test materials containing
a complete growth medium. Paclitaxel was used as a positive control.
The plates were further incubated under the same conditions for another
48 h at 37 °C. The cells were then fixed with cold trichloroacetic
acid for 1 h at 4 °C. After 1 h, the plates were rinsed three
times with water and allowed to air dry. After drying, 100 μL
of 0.4% sulforhodamine B (SRB) dye was added and kept for half an
hour at RT. The plates were subsequently washed three times with 1%
v/v acetic acid to remove the unbound SRB. After drying at RT, the
bound dye was solubilized by adding 100 μL of 10 mM Tris (tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane)
buffer (pH 10.4) to each well. To solubilize the protein-bound dye,
the plates were kept on the shaker for 5 min. Finally, OD was taken
at 540 nm in a microplate reader. IC50 values were determined
by plotting OD against concentration.19    

3.7.2 Nuclear Morphology Assessment
Nuclear
morphology study was done using the dye 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylidole
(DAPI). DAPI binds to the minor groove of double-stranded DNA, with
a preference for the adenine–thymine clusters in the interphase
of the mitotic cell. The formation of apoptotic bodies was confirmed
by performing DAPI staining to visualize whether the cell nucleus
in the fragmented form remains intact after treatment with the molecule.
Human cancer cells SW-620 (colon cancer) were seeded at 1.5 ×
105 cells/mL/well in six-well tissue culture plates in
RPMI medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. This was followed
by incubation for 24 h at 37 °C in a CO2 incubator.
After 24 h, the cells were treated with this different concentration
of stock solution and with paclitaxel (positive control) and incubated
for 48 h. After 48 h, the incubation medium was removed, and the cells
were fixed with methanol followed by incubation for 20 min at 37 °C.
After fixation, the cells were stained with DAPI (1 μg/mL) and
incubated for 20 min in the dark at RT. The dye was removed and washed
with 1% phosphate-buffered saline and examined under an inverted fluorescence
microscope (Olympus, 1 × 81).20

3.7.3 Detection of Intracellular and Mitochondrial
ROS Levels
Cellular and mitochondrial ROS levels were determined
using DCFDA and MitoSOX Red, respectively, according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Briefly, SW-620 cells (2 × 105 mL/well)
were seeded in six-well tissue culture plates and incubated at 37
°C for 24 h. After 24 h, the cells were treated with 2b at different concentrations (0.8, 1.7, 3.5, and 7 μM) and
incubated for 48 h. After this, the media were removed, and DC-FDA
and MitoSOX Red dye were added and further incubated for 20 min at
37 °C. Before the addition of the dye, the cells were incubated
with H2O2 (0.05%) as a positive control for
15 min. The total cellular and mitochondrial ROS levels were monitored
by a fluorescence microscope (Olympus, 1 × 81).21

3.7.4 Caspase-3/7 Activity Assay
The
activity of caspase-3/7 in SW-620 cell lysates was performed by using
the fluorescent assay (caspase-3/7 activity assay kit #5723). It contains
a fluorogenic substrate (N-acetyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-7-amino-4-methylcoumarin
or Ac-DEVD–AMC) for caspase-3/7 and cleaves this substrate
between DEVD and AMC, generating a highly fluorescent AMC proportional
to the number of apoptotic cells in the sample. This is detected using
a fluorescence reader with excitation at 380 nm and emission between
420 and 460 nm. The SW-620 cells were seeded at 1 × 105 cells/well in a 96-well plate and kept overnight. After 24 h, the
cells were treated with different concentrations of 2b for 48 h and then lysed in 30 μL of lysis buffer (1×)
(supplied with the kit). The cell lysate was mixed with the substrate
solution, incubated at 37 °C in the dark for 2 h, and visualized
using a relative fluorescent unit.22

3.7.5 Western Blotting Analysis
The SW-620
cells were centrifuged at 1200g for 10 min, and the
cell pellet was collected and lysed with a lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl
pH 8.0, 120 mM NaCl, 0.5% NP-40, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride).
A 50 μg of protein was loaded onto 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide
gel and electrophoresed. After electrophoresis, the protein was transferred
to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore, IPVH00010, USA),
and the membrane was blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in tris-buffered
saline-Tween buffer 7 (0.12 M Tris base, 1.5 M NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20)
at RT for 2 h. The membrane was then incubated with primary mouse
antibody against β-actin (1:2000), Bax (1:2000 #5023), and Bcl-2
(1:2000# 15701) (Cell Signaling Technologies) overnight at 4 °C
followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary
antibody (antimouse #7076 and antirabbit #7074 1:1000) for 1 h at
RT. Protein–antibody complexes were detected using chemiluminescence
(Immobilon Western chemiluminescent HRP substrate, MERCK Millipore,
USA).23

4 Conclusions
Various studies have reported that increased intracellular ROS
can cause cell membrane potential damage and thus block the cell cycle,
get into the cell nucleus to cause DNA damage, further activate the
endogenous pathway, and ultimately lead to cell death. In the current
study, neoandrographolide was isolated from A. paniculata to generate its hydroxyl-protected 19-O-β-glucoside
analogues. An increase in the anticancer activity was observed in
its acetonides. These derivatives were assessed for enhancement in
their anticancer potential as compared to the parent molecule. 4′,6′-Benzylidene
neoandrographolide inhibited the proliferation of SW-620 colon cancer
cells by increasing the intracellular ROS levels, which resulted in
an increased oxidative stress, and, subsequently, induced apoptosis.
Taken together, 4′,6′-benzylidene neoandrographolide
induced apoptosis on SW-620 cells via ROS-mediated mitochondria-dependent
pathway. To find out the molecular mechanism of the active molecules,
nuclear morphology studies were done by DAPI staining and intracellular
ROS accumulation detection. The derivative 2b showed
an increase in the generation of cellular and mitochondrial levels
of ROS in a concentration-dependent manner, ultimately leading to
apoptosis. This was caused by ROS through the involvement of the mitochondrial
pathway in SW-620 colon cancer cells. The inactivation of Bcl-2 is
carried out by caspase–3 which acts downstream of Bax/Bcl-2,
enabling its anti-apoptotic capacity to promote cell death.24 It may be concluded that 2b significantly
induces an apoptotic effect on colorectal cancer cells in vitro, through
its mechanism associated with the Bcl-2/Bax/caspase-3 pathway. To
the best of our knowledge, the present study is the first report on
the semisynthesis of neoandrographolide derivatives and their anticancer
studies. Therefore, 4′,6′-benzylidene neoandrographolide
is a novel candidate for antitumor therapy in patients with colon
cancer.
