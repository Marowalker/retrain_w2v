Drops
with larger volumes placed over a superhydrophobic (SH) surface with a hole do not fall through unless
they are evaporated to a size that is small enough. This feature offers
the ability to preconcentrate samples for biochemical analysis. In
this work, the influence of pinning on the behavior of drops placed
on a 0.1 mm thick SH substrate with a 2 mm diameter hole as they evaporated
was investigated. With 16 μL of water dispensed, the sessile
drop component volume was initially higher than that of the overhanging
drop component and maintained this until the later stages where almost
identical shapes were attained and full evaporation was achieved without
falling off the hole. With 15 μL of water dispensed, the volume
of the sessile drop was initially higher than that of the overhanging
drop component but the liquid body was able to squeeze through the
hole after 180 s due to the contact line not having sufficient pinning
strength when it encountered the edge of the hole. This resulted in
the liquid body either falling through the hole or remaining pinned
with an oval-like shape. When it did not fall-off, the liquid body
had volume and contact angle characteristics for the sessile drop
and overhanging drop components that were reversed. In the later stages,
however, nearly identical shapes were again attained and full evaporation
was achieved without falling off the hole. The effects of pinning,
despite the substrate being SH, offer another path toward achieving
practical outcomes with liquid bodies without the need for chemical
surface functionalization. Similarities and differences could be seen in the behavior of
a sessile drop on a SH plate that was inclined at 30° to the
horizontal and evaporated.

Introduction
Superhydrophobic (SH)
surfaces offer an attractive means to developing
applications because of liquid bodies placed on them having low levels
of adhesion1 and possessing reduced resistance
when a liquid flows over them.2 The former
has been widely harnessed for self-cleaning,3−5 although this
low-adhesion property has also been increasingly explored in applications
involving drops to advance biochemical processing and analysis with
the advantage of limited sample loss and contamination.6−10 In evaporative preconcentration of drops, it is particularly desirable
to have the lowest solid–liquid contact area and adhesion possible
to minimize entity deposition on the solid substrate. Typically, the
drop volumes post evaporation ought to have specific values. Electronic
monitoring followed by mechanical intervention allows for this.11 Recently, an autonomous “manhole”
approach was demonstrated in lieu, wherein drops with larger volumes
when placed over a SH surface with a hole would fall through after
being evaporated to a smaller volume.12 It was revealed, however, that the method worked well with meshed
rather than solid surfaces, indicating a strong pinning influence
offered by the solid phase at the edge of the hole.

The pinning
behavior of sessile drops on tilted surfaces has been
well-studied. On a perfectly horizontal surface, large sessile drops
can be developed in this manner, where the contact angle θ is
typically in the equilibrium state. However, any extent of surface
tilt will cause the drop to possess advancing θa and
receding θr contact angles. With increasing tilt,
the drop’s ability to accommodate contact angle hysteresis
will eventually be exceeded by gravitational force,13 resulting in its detachment and movement on the surface.
It has been shown that with onset of tilt the advancing contact line
breaches first, leaving the receding contact line to determine the
drop’s ability to detach.14−16 This then allows the
ability of the drop to resist movement to be enhanced17−19 or for the shape to be altered20,21 (if the surface
is hydrophilic) by providing additional pinning modes at the locale
of the receding contact line.

In this work, a thin SH solid
substrate with a 2 mm hole was prepared.
A liquid was then placed directly above the hole, and its characteristics
were studied with the onset of evaporation. The small thickness (0.1
mm) of the substrate used permitted good side views to analyze the
volume and contact angle development of the sessile drop and overhanging
drop components more distinctly. The underlying behavior in relation
to observable shapes was then characterized using models that depict
large to small sessile drops residing on strongly nonwetting surfaces
and of drops subjected to gravitational force that cause them to display
oval-like forms. The similarities and differences in the behavior
of sessile drops placed on surfaces inclined at an angle to horizontal
are highlighted.

Shapes of Sessile Drops on Highly Nonwetting
Surfaces
In order for evaporative preconcentration to be
effective, drops
need to be evaporated from reasonably large volumes.11,12 The shapes of sessile drops on horizontal surfaces have been extensively
studied. In the absence of wetting interactions and gravity, drops
would form spheres that contact the solid substrate at a single point.
When the drop volume is small enough such that the influence of gravity
is negligible, wetting interactions will cause drops to spread and
produce a semispherical shape. If the volume is large enough, such
that gravity cannot be excluded, the drop flattens out such that the
shape transitions are gradual and the mathematics that describes the
shape of sessile drops is no longer straightforward.

Bashforth
and Adams22 were arguably
the first to approximate the shapes of large sessile drops by trying
to solve the Young–Laplace equation with hydrostatic effects
incorporated via iterative numerical calculations. The basis of this
was then used to develop a more simplified model with some geometrical
approximations.23 Other models based on
spheroids have also been developed.24−27

For the purposes of explaining
some aspects of drop behavior observed
here, we adopt a double-spheroid model.27 This essentially means that if a cross section is taken of the distorted
shape, it will comprise two ellipses having a common origin O and
one principal axis length a (see Figure 1). The solid substrate is located
at vertical height yo below the origin.
The top ellipse has a second principal axis length b, and at the point of intersection of the bottom ellipse with substrate
C, its second principal axis length c can be determined
from 1  From here, the volume of the liquid
drop can
be determined by geometry to be 2  The apparent contact angle, θ, can be
obtained based on the tangent of the bottom ellipse at C, in which 3

top (solid line) and bottom (dashed line) ellipses meeting seamlessly
at B, resulting in a common origin O. The drop contacts the substrate
at height yo below the origin. This parameter
together with a, b, c, and xo allows the volume and contact
angle to be estimated.

Drop Shape Model under a Force
When a drop on a substrate
is tilted at an angle to the horizontal,
the balance of forces that act at the three-phase contact line to
keep it in place would need to counteract the resultant gravitational
force. This naturally results in a departure from the axisymmetric
shape when it is placed on the horizontal. When viewed from its side,
the drop will exhibit advancing and receding contact angles. The view
from the top alternatively reveals the contact line of the base of
the drop being shifted forward in the direction of gravity, whereas
its line curvature tends to grow. Attempts to numerically depict this
shape have been done using surface energy considerations.28

The deformed shape of the drop when viewed
in relation to the action
of a force resembles an oval. Here, we seek to obtain a model that
defines the shape characteristic alone. Equations depicting ovals
are often based on modifications made to the standard equation of
the ellipse. In the model here, we use one end of the oval as origin
O so that it will be easier to derive the defining parameters without
locating the origin within the shape itself (see Figure 2). If point P along the z axis is taken to vary cosinusoidally according to angle
ϕ, we have 4  and the shape is generated
through 5  where l and m are
the constants that define it. The coordinates of any point Q
on the deformed drop shape can thus be given by 6  If we use constants K1 = 2(l + m) and K2 = 4m to replace l and m, a compact equation of the shape
will be
made available through 7  By evaluating the volume by integration through , we have in the case where K2 ≠

Materials and Methods
Surface Preparation
The SH substrate
used for the main
experiment was prepared from copper sheets of thickness 0.1 mm. A
2 mm hole was created on it using a tungsten carbide drill bit operated
at 10 000 rpm. First, the samples were polished until they
were shiny and then ultrasonicated in ethanol (70% v/v) and acetone
for 3 min and subsequently in deionized (DI) water for another 15
min. In the next step, the substrates were oxidized in a solution
containing 2 M NaOH and 1.5 M (NH4)2S2O8 for 5 min. The samples were then allowed to synthesize
in an oven at 180 °C for 120 min. At the end of the reaction,
the substrate was taken out of the solution, rinsed several times
with DI water and ethanol, and then dried with compressed air. The
as-obtained product was dried at 180 °C for 2 h to complete the
phase transfer from hydroxides to oxides. In the final step, the substrates
were silanized using 1H,1H,2H,2H-perfluorodecyl-triethoxysilane (FAS)
to obtain a low-surface-energy layer with good corrosion resistance
and thermal stability. The substrate was immersed in FAS–ethanol
solution for 30 min and finally dried in the oven at 150 °C for
10 min.

A second substrate was prepared with a silicone sheet
of 60 μm thickness and with a 2 mm hole created on it using
a tungsten carbide drill bit operated at 10 000 rpm. During
observations, the two ends of the substrate were pulled apart and
kept in position using weights to ensure that the substrate was taut.

A third SH substrate was used for the secondary experiment according
to a method previously shown.29 For this,
a copper plate was polished to remove scratches using silicon carbide
electrocoated water-proof abrasive paper (KMCA, WET/DRY S85 P600).
Prior to use, it was first cleaned using absolute ethanol, allowed
to air-dry, and then immersed in a 24.75 mM aqueous solution of silver
nitrate (AgNO3) for 1 min to form micro- and nanostructures.
Subsequently, it was rinsed with copious amounts of distilled water
followed by absolute ethanol before being allowed to air-dry. Once
dried, it was immersed in a 1 mM solution of surface modifier CF3(CF2)7CH2CH2SH
in absolute ethanol (ethanol with low water content) for 5 min. An
impression of 1 mm diameter was created using a pipette tip on the
surface. This was to create a hydrophilic circular region that is
bounded by superhydrophobicity.

Characterization of Surfaces
The SH copper sheet and
plate samples were placed on stubs using a conductive adhesive and
examined using a scanning electron microscope (SEM, Nova NanoSEM 430;
FEI). As the samples were conductive, we were able to use 10 keV for
imaging. In the case of the silicone sheet, it was coated with gold
prior to imaging. Imaging was done on the Hitachi TM3030 SEM for this
sample.

To obtain optical profilometry images of the copper
sheet in the vicinity of the hole within, the sample was attached
onto a flat silicon surface to serve as reference. This was then placed
inside the profilometer (Bruker ContourGT-I), where optical scans
were made. Processing and analysis were performed on the instrument’s
accompanying software (Contour Elite). Because of the relatively large
area to be covered, multiple images were recorded, and the stitching
capability was used to create an integrated map over an extended field
of view.

Drop Shape Measurements
Side views of the drops were
recorded using a camera (Moticam 2.0). A bright light-emitting diode
lamp with a diffuser was used to provide the lighting for the recordings.
The recorded images were then analyzed using processing software (ImageJ
and Tracker) to determine the contact angles and their lengths on
the solid substrate. To determine the volume, routines in Matlab were
written based on eqs 2, 8, and 9.

Drop Evaporated
on Hole
In the first set of experiments,
relatively large drops of deionized water were dispensed on the SH
surface such that they sat directly above the hole. Before the drops
were dispensed, a spirit level was used to ensure that the substrates
were horizontal (free from tilting). With the aid of a radiant heater,
the drops were allowed to evaporate. During the process, images of
the drops were recorded at specific time intervals to analyze their
shape characteristics.

On the basis of the outcome of the first
set of experiments, a second set was conducted wherein drop volume
was adjusted so that the length of the drop of deionized water on
the surface approximated closely with the diameter of the hole. This
was found to coincide with a volume of 15 μL of water dispensed.
With the aid of a radiant heater, the drop was again allowed to evaporate.
Images of the drop were recorded at specific time intervals to analyze
its shape characteristics. The experiment was repeated on the silicone
surface with hole for comparisons.

An infrared thermometer (Raytek
Raynger ST Pro Plus) with 1 °C
resolution and 500 ms response time was used to measure the substrate
temperature close to the three-phase contact line at four positions
spaced 90° apart from each other. The temperature was found to
vary by not more than ±1.2 °C from the mean of 25 °C.
This indicated that thermal gradients were not likely to be responsible
for any of the behaviors observed. The humidity throughout the experiments
was also monitored and found to vary by not more than 2% from the
mean of 46%. The experiments were also conducted in an enclosed space
to eliminate any forced convection influences.

Drop Evaporated on an Inclined
Surface
The SH plate
was placed on a modified optomechanical rotary stage (Edmund Optics,
52-572) previously described.16 The stage
has a 1° resolution and permitted a drop to be located on the
SH plate substrate at the gimbal position. This circumvents the need
to move the camera when different degrees of tilt are applied and
also allows the substrate to be tilted over a large angular range.
A liquid drop of 20 μL was dispensed on the SH plate in the
horizontal position at the location of the circular non-SH region.
The plate was then rotated by 30° such that the extent of contact
angle hysteresis was as high as possible before any contact line breaching.
With the aid of the radiant heater, the drop was allowed to evaporate.
Images of the drop were recorded at intervals in time to analyze its
shape characteristics.

Results and Discussion
Figure 3A provides
the SEM images of the SH sheet sample. The hierarchical microscale
and nanoscale structures (taken at 500 μm from the edge of the
hole) are predominantly prismatic. The SEM image of the SH substrate
with a circular impression made on it is shown in Figure 3B. Whereas the SH region clearly
has hierarchical dendritic microscale and nanoscale structures that
permit predominant Cassie wetting, there is clear absence of these
structures within the circular impression, which should then allow
predominant Wenzel wetting. At the interface between these two regions,
there is a distinct separation of the two structure types, indicating
a means for a liquid drop resting on the circular impression region
to possess high apparent contact angles at the three-phase contact
line. Figure 3C provides
SEM images of the silicone sheet sample (taken also at 500 μm
from the edge of the hole). There is a general lack of hierarchical
structures, albeit some scratching of the surface is evident. This
is typical of silicone surfaces due to their general softness.

Figure 3 SEM images
of the SH sheet (A) show structures that support predominant
Cassie wetting throughout. With the SH plate (B), the structures observed
at the circular impression region suggest Wenzel wetting bounded by
areas that permit Cassie wetting. The silicone substrate (C) generally
lacks structures but does have presence of scratches due to its softness.
The images in (A) and (C) were taken 500 μm from the edge of
the hole.

The optical profilometer trace
of the SH sheet around the area
of the hole indicated reasonably uniform edges (Figure 4). In addition, the transition area was limited
to around 10 μm, which implied a sharp rather than tapered discontinuity.
There was also absence of any escarpment due to material build-up.
The ability of any contact line to pin is hence dependent solely on
the edges that surround the hole over the thickness of the sheet.

profilometry of the SH sheet near the hole. On the basis
of the profile map, the contact line pinning will rely on the edges
of the hole.

When water drops of 16
μL volume (or larger) were first dispensed
over the hole on the SH surface, a prominent overhanging component
is visible (Figure 5). This component, with a hemispherical front, forms to counteract
the pressure (hydrostatic and Laplace) that develops at the liquid
body on top of the substrate. We consider that the liquid body shape
changes with the onset of evaporation. In the initial stages, only
the sessile drop component appears to lose volume, proceeding until
around 450 s from the start. After this period, the overhanging component
joins in the process of evaporation, where volumes of both sessile
and overhanging components contract in sync. An important characteristic
to note is that the liquid body evaporates fully without falling through
the hole via gravity. This happens despite the seemingly small thickness
of the sheet, which should limit the amount of pinning available at
the edge of the hole.

Figure 5 Side views of a 16 μL liquid body deposited on the
hole of
the SH sheet at various time points during evaporation. The liquid
body initially comprises a sessile drop and an overhanging drop component.
The former decreases in volume initially until a stage where both
subsequently do so in tandem. The liquid body fully evaporates without
falling off the hole.

We depict the shape changes quantitatively. The sessile drop
component
appears to reduce its size by evaporation in the manner of a large
sessile drop formed on a typical surface. To confirm this, we tracked
the values of a, b, c, xo, and yo (Figure 1) to determine
the attendant values of V and θ from eqs 2 and 3 respectively. It should be noted that this model begins to become
inaccurate when the drop shape departs markedly from a hydrophobic
characteristic. Hence, at these stages, the volume of the sessile
drop component was determined analytically using a semispherical model.
In the case of the overhanging drop component, the volume was determined
using the semispherical model throughout.

From the plots of
the sessile drop and overhanging drop volume
components with time (see Figure 6A), it can be seen that the former reduces throughout
the evaporation process. The latter, however, increases marginally
until around 300 s from the start before it also began reducing in
the same manner as the former. The corresponding contact angle plots
(Figure 6B) furnish
better insights into this. The sessile drop component showed relatively
constant contact angles for the first 100 s. To accommodate for volume
decreases with time, the contact line would have to move in at a rate
such that volume reduction of the sessile component would exceed the
amount of liquid evaporated. Furthermore, this lack of initial pinning
is at odds with results reported previously of sessile drops evaporated
on solid SH substrates.30 This deviation
in behavior can be accounted for by the overhanging drop undergoing
a volume increase at the same time. Essentially, the liquid body applied
surface energy redistributions via changes to the overhanging drop
to bypass the expected pinning characteristic.

Figure 6 Volumes (A) and contact
angles (B) of the sessile and overhanging
drop components of the 16 μL liquid body deposited on the hole
of the SH sheet at various time points during evaporation. In the
case of volume, the sessile drop component can be seen to be reducing
throughout, whereas the overhanging drop component increases marginally
until around 300 s before it begins reducing in volume. In terms of
contact angles, the sessile component is able to maintain a constant
value in the first 100 s before decreasing thereafter. The overhanging
component has a trend of contact angle values that directly reflect
changes in its volume.

The mechanics at play can be compared for similarities and
differences
with sessile drops on an incline that exhibits advancing and receding
contact lines (indicated by AL and RL, respectively) and thus having
attendant advancing and receding contact angles θa and θr (see Figure 7). In the situation here, advancing and receding contact
lines (indicated by AL and RL, respectively) can also be identified
as shown in Figure 8A. At the initial stage before evaporation begins, AL resides within
the edge of the hole, whereas RL lies on the top surface. The former
is strongly pinned, whereas pinning of the latter is weaker due to
its interaction with a flat SH substrate. With the onset of evaporation,
the receding contact line is then able to move radially inward (toward
the center of the hole) to accommodate the energy changes that ensue.
In the process, the contact angle (which is receding in the context
of the entire liquid body) remained relatively invariant. This should
result in an increasing Laplace pressure because the radii are gradually
reduced (i.e., ΔP = 2/γR). Yet, this does not cause significant changes at the advancing
contact line. This is due to the known ability of a liquid to harness
the sharp edges located on the bottom surface of the substrate for
added resistance toward any outward radial spreading (first reported
40 years ago by Oliver et al.31). This
is attested to by the corresponding increases in the contact angle
(which is advancing in the context of the entire liquid body) exhibited
by the overhanging drop component (Figure 6B). A major point of difference lies in the
contact angle of the overhanging component being consistently smaller
than that of the sessile drop component (Figure 6B). This infers strong stability of the liquid
body as it resides on the hole.

Figure 7 Sessile drop on an incline exhibiting
advancing and receding contact
lines at AL and RL, as well as advancing and receding contact angles
θa and θr.

Figure 8 Schematic depiction of the mechanics of a liquid volume with a
diameter relatively larger than the hole diameter such that the sessile
drop component has its contact line moving inward toward the hole
even as its contact angle is reducing (A). As the contact line of
the overhanging component is pinned, surface energy changes are accommodated
through contact angle changes alone where the liquid–gas interface
moves from I to II initially but begins to move back to I as the drop
volume continues to decrease with evaporation. In the last stage of
the process (B), AL and RL move toward each other to create mirrorlike
liquid–gas interfaces. When a smaller liquid volume is dispensed,
drop behavior begins with (A) but then switches to (C) once the contact
line of the sessile drop component reaches the edge of the hole. Because
of the sudden volume changes, the roles and behavior of the sessile
and overhanging drop components are exchanged. However, in the last
stage, drop behavior reverts back to (B).

It is noteworthy that after the initial 100 s the contact
angle
of the sessile drop component started to decrease, in the same manner
as its volume, to values that are significantly below 90° (see Figure 7B). It has been previously
argued that the surface energy of any liquid on a real SH surface
is distributed according to the Cassie–Baxter and Wenzel components.32 It is plausible that with the onset of evaporation
the ratio of latter may increase over the former, which may then allow
for a sessile drop that initially exhibited predominant Cassie–Baxter
behavior to transition toward a more predominant Wenzel character.
A quantitative analysis to determine this in the current context will
be challenging as the surface structures are hierarchical.

Beyond
the first 100 s, the contact angle of the overhanging drop
component continued to increase until the 300 s time point, after
which it exhibited a reducing trend in a similar fashion as that of
the sessile drop. This reversal is marked by a slowdown in the contact
angle reduction rate of the sessile drop component (at time points
from 300 to 400 s). This phenomenon is attributed to the inability
of the liquid body to shift mass toward the overhanging drop component
indefinitely for surface energy adjustments. Once a tipping point
is reached (at the 300 s time point), the movement of AL (Figure 8A) slows down to
allow both the sessile drop and overhanging drop components to reduce
their volumes in tandem to respond to the mass loss from evaporation.

Clearly, RL in Figure 8A must reach the edge of the hole at some stage where it starts
to encounter much stronger pinning. With an inability of RL now to
move at this point, the onset of evaporation then causes the contact
angle of the sessile component to reduce more significantly. The situation
of RL reaching the edge of the hole is supported by observations at
the 400 s time point, where a change in the contact angle reduction
rate of the sessile drop component is discernible (Figure 8B). In the process, the contact
angle was reduced by 43° from its starting condition and its value at 90° at the
400 s time point. This logically should lead to a Laplace pressure
reduction that ought to cause the advancing contact line to commence
reversing its earlier adjustment. This is indeed observed in the contact
angle versus time plot for the overhanging component (Figure 6B). Intriguingly, this will
eventually reach a stage where the advancing and receding contact
lines will almost merge as one along the edge of the hole. From this
stage onward, the top and bottom liquid bodies should have almost
similar surface energies, leading to a propensity for both entities
to adopt identical shapes. This is apparent in the image corresponding
to the 510 s time point (Figure 6). As evaporation progresses with more volume loss,
the liquid body should progress toward a stretched thin film state
over the hole. However, rupture often occurs before this takes hold.
From 20 repetitions at 16 μL volume, there were no instances
in which the drop was able to fall through the hole. In addition,
similar characteristics were observed with liquid volumes from 16
to 25 μL. We have included the sequence of images of the evaporation
of a 25 μL drop as Supporting Information.

When 15 μL drops are directly placed over the hole
on the
same SH sheet, a strong overall departure from the earlier behavior
is observed (Figure 9). As in the previous case, only the sessile drop component appears
to lose volume up to around 180 s from the start. At the 180 s stage,
the liquid body undergoes a dramatic change in shape as it seemingly
attempts to “squeeze” through the hole, causing the
overhanging component to extend downward and the overall shape to
be oval-like. This results in two outcomes. In the first, the liquid
body falls completely from the hole (as per the manhole effect previously
reported12). In the other, depicted in
the remaining image–time sequences of Figure 9, the overhanging component starts to contract
progressively. The occurrence of either is counterintuitive because
a smaller volume was used at the start (i.e., 15 μL instead
of 16 μL). The end phase mimics the behavior uncovered in the
previous case, where identical liquid shapes form and progress to
being fully evaporated without falling through the hole.

Figure 9 Side views
of a 15 μL liquid body deposited on the hole of
the SH sheet at various time points during evaporation. In the initial
stages, the majority of liquid was centered on the sessile drop component.
At the 180 s time point, when the sessile drop contact line reached
the edge of the hole, the majority of the sessile drop component volume
was transferred suddenly to the overhanging drop component. With further
evaporation, the volume of the overhanging drop continues to contract
until the volume of both components equated with each other before
the liquid body fully evaporated without detaching from the hole.

To better understand the mechanics,
it will be necessary to break
the analysis into stages. The first stage, which takes place over
the first 180 s, follows in the same vein as the sessile and overhanging
drop volume and contact angle trends (Figure 10A) with the 16 μL case. A noteworthy
difference lies in the contact angle of the sessile drop component,
reducing almost right from the outset (Figure 10B). This departure is accounted for by the
lower contact angle that it first exhibited (120° instead of
140°), which meant that it possessed a higher Wenzel energy content.
In addition, the initial volume and contact angle of the overhanging
component remained 1.2 μL and 60°, respectively, at the
start. This meant that the sessile component needed to adopt lower
contact angles because its volume was relatively smaller than that
previously. Apart from this, the overall mechanics for this stage
follows that described previously through Figure 8A.

Figure 10 Volumes (A) and contact angles (B) of the sessile
and overhanging
drop components of the 15 μL liquid body deposited on the hole
of the SH sheet at various time points during evaporation. The distributions
are far more complex and involve sudden large changes that were observed
when the contact line of the sessile drop component reaches the edge
of the hole.

The second stage occurs
when the contact line of the sessile drop
component reaches the edge of hole (at 180 s). The plots of volume
against time (Figure 10A) show a sudden exchange in behavior for the sessile and overhanging
components. This now resulted in the volume of the overhanging component
and its rate of reduction with evaporation being higher than those
of the sessile component. Hence, the mechanics depicted in Figure 8A reverts instead
to that described in Figure 8C for this stage. This can be accounted for by the relatively
small reduction in the contact angle (10°) of the sessile drop
component to 110° (instead of 90°) at the 180 s time point.
Without the contact line being able to attain as strong a pinning
strength when it encounters the edge of hole as previously, the liquid
body then encounters less resistance to squeeze through the hole.
The prevailing pinning strength when this happens then dictates whether
the liquid body detaches fully or stays at the hole. It is interesting
to note that the 15 μL volume is limiting, as attempts to dispense
14 μL resulted in the liquid body falling right through.

The volume exchange behavior is also demonstrated by the contact
angles (see Figure 10B). Because of the reversal in volume compositions, the roles of
the sessile and overhanging drop components are also swapped. Interestingly,
this imbues the same ability for the sessile drop component to first
increase its contact angle before reducing it later during evaporation.
This feature was available only for the overhanging drop component
in the 16 μL case. These results imply that surface energy adjustments
via contact angle increase and decrease are reserved for the smaller
liquid body component. This is reasonable because smaller liquid bodies
tend to be less energetically stable than larger versions.

Once
the condition of both contact angles reducing with time is
established, the mechanics reverts back to the situation depicted
in Figure 8B, where
the liquid body eventually evaporates away fully. It is compelling
at this juncture to note that the contact line pinning effects that
hold the liquid in place (i.e., at 180 s) rely on a surface area (at
the edge of the hole) that takes up barely 2.9% of the total surface
area of liquid. If the circumference is attributed instead to the
liquid body being able to “hang-on” to the substrate
via the hole, this equates to it having a pinning retention capacity
of 0.0148 N/m without the need to alter the micro- and nanostructure
compositions that typically would allow it to assume a more predominant
Wenzel wetting to do so. This represents about one-fifth the surface
tension of water (0.0728 N/m). It is noteworthy that in using 15 μL,
the liquid body dispensed did not fall through 14 times out of 20
repetitions made. The distribution of falling and nonfalling occurrences
was also random, leading us to conclude that the pinning behavior
leading to drop hanging was purely stochastic.

These findings
have important implications in the reported use
of evaporative preconcentration to assist in the detection of low
concentrations of nanoparticles in solutions while limiting the effect
of contamination (from other stray particulates in the environment)
using SH substrates.12 In using SH mesh
substrates with holes, it is possible to conduct this with multiple
drops, combining those that have fallen off (the liquid drop fall-off
assured because cross-sectional pinning area being minimized), and
then repeating the process. This will result in a final drop that
will have a much higher concentration of nanoparticles available for
detection. It is conceivable that at the stage prior to measurement,
it should be possible to obtain the highest nanoparticle concentration
in the solution possible if the drop following evaporation did not
fall-off (the presence of a hole still needed to minimize liquid–solid
contact). In this situation, knowledge of the condition where the
lowest drop volume can be dispensed without it falling off the hole
would be useful.

When 15 μL of DI water was dispensed
on the silicone substrate
with hole, the overhanging component was not clearly observable (Figure 11). With evaporation,
the drop altered its shape without any apparent effects offered by
the hole and eventually evaporated off fully on the substrate without
falling off.

Figure 11 Side views of a 15 μL liquid body deposited on the
hole of
the silicone sheet at various time points during evaporation. The
overhanging drop component was not as noticeable from the outset,
and the liquid body evaporated fully on the surface without ever falling
through the hole. The ability of drops to fall through or dangle from
the hole with evaporation appears limited to cases where strong Cassie
wetting occurs.

The liquid body beyond
the 180 s time point with the SH substrate
has advancing contact angles that are larger than the receding contact
angles, which is akin to the situation of drops being tilted on inclines.
To develop a comparison, a secondary experiment involving a second
substrate with hydrophilic and SH features was conducted with a 20
μL drop placed on it. The substrate was then inclined at an
angle of 30° to the horizontal and then allowed to evaporate.
The stage at which the overhanging component of the liquid body retracts
can be equated to the behavior of a sessile drop illustrated under
this condition. Clearly, when the substrate is inclined to the horizontal,
the advancing and receding contact angles are differentiated due to
hysteresis, leading to a “leaning over” behavior at
the front end (Figure 12). This is aided to some extent by the ability of AL but not RL to
breach initially, similar to situations that were reported previously.14−16 With evaporation, this contact angle disparity reduces and AL gradually
restores back toward its condition before breaching. From the quantitative
plots of advancing and receding angles with time (Figure 13A), it can be seen that the
rate with which the advancing contact angle reduces is somewhat similar
to the rate at which the receding contact angle increases. This is
markedly different from the case when 15 μL was placed on the
SH sheet with a hole and at the stage where the overhanging component
dominates (Figure 10B). It is also noteworthy that the liquid length in contact with
the solid reduces significantly with evaporation (Figure 13B) and the situation where
AL moves relatively toward RL gives the impression of gravity being
defied. This behavior appears similar to the case when the overhanging
drop component dominates with 15 μL placed on the SH sheet with
a hole.

Figure 12 Sequence of images showing a sessile drop originally placed on
a horizontal SH plate, then tilted at an angle of 30°, and then
evaporated over time. The amount of hysteresis and contact area on
the substrate is reduced with evaporation. There are similarities
and differences in shape changes of the liquid body on the SH hole.

Figure 13 Contact angle (A) traces of the 20 μL
drop placed on the
SH plate tilted at 30° to the horizontal. With the onset of evaporation,
the advancing and receding contact angles decreased and increased,
respectively. The liquid length on the substrate (B) reduces with
evaporation as the advancing contact line achieves its nonbreaching
condition. In this process, the receding contact line position was
invariant.

The extent that the
sessile drop on the incline is able to restore
from its forward leaning over shape behavior is naturally more limited
if no breaching of AL occurs. Much of this is caused by the need for
some liquid–solid interface area to exist, which is taken up
substantially by the distance separation between AL and RL (see Figure 7). This is in contrast
to the case when the drop is placed on the hole, which, because of
the small thickness of the sheet, meant that AL and RL are almost
merged. The circumference of the hole then contributes more strongly
to the liquid–solid interface area requirement despite it retaining
a Cassie wetting state. It should also be noted that the manner in
which sessile drops with high contact angles are being constrained
on inclines makes them less stable, imbuing them with a propensity
to resonate when periodic33,34 or stochastic29,35 perturbations are introduced. We have noticed a similar resonant
motion with perturbations, which may be linked to the geometry and
composition of the liquid body. This offers avenues to reveal information
about the properties of liquid samples.

A cardinal point to
raise here is that unlike the case of the sessile
drop on an incline, where pinning is afforded by hydrophilic regions
(with the SH regions merely serving to increase the contact angles),
the capability of the substrate with a hole to sustain the liquid
body is provided solely by pinning at the edges of the orifice notwithstanding
the material makeup being entirely SH. This affords a new paradigm
to how wetting characteristics using SH surfaces can be harnessed.
In numerical microscopic-scale studies conducted on regularly spaced
pillars, the distances between them have been found to be strongly
responsible in ascertaining whether overall Cassie or Wenzel wetting
can be attained.36 This is seemingly attractive
in that wetting characteristics can be tuned by changing this parameter
alone. More recently, however, the effect played by evaporation in
altering these characteristics has been reported.37 Because evaporation cannot be avoided or easily controlled
in most real-world situations, the reliance on Cassie or Wenzel wetting
changes via the former strategy can be limiting. In addition, the
generation of surfaces using regular microposts will generally be
too expensive to be usable in many real-world applications.

The work here provides evidence that interventions at a more macroscopic
scale (more specifically with millimeter size scale holes) hold the
key to liquids attaining retention characteristics despite the inherent
surface wetting characteristics remaining predominantly Cassie in
nature. We contend that further investigations along this vein hold
promise to being able to better tailor SH surfaces for various practical
applications. Such an endeavor has some similarities with a previous
report using pinning to create highly deformed shapes,38 albeit in that case the surface has to be inherently
hydrophilic to start with.

Conclusions
Liquid of different
volumes dispensed onto a 0.1 mm thick SH sheet
with a 2 mm hole exhibited different characteristics with evaporation.
When 16 μL of water was dispensed, the volume of the sessile
drop was initially higher than that of the overhanging drop component
and consistently maintained this behavior until the later stages where
both assumed almost similar volumes and evaporated fully without falling
off the hole. In contrast, when 15 μL of water was dispensed,
the volume of the sessile drop was initially higher than that of the
overhanging drop component until a stage (at the 180 s time point)
when sudden changes occurred due to the contact line not having sufficient
pinning strength when encountering the edge of the hole. This caused
the liquid body to squeeze through the hole, resulting in either its
detachment from the hole or its pinning by the edges into an oval-like
shape. In the latter case, the liquid body assumed reversed volume
and contact angle characteristics for the sessile drop and overhanging
drop components compared with those for the 16 μL drop volume case. In the later stages,
both sessile and overhanging components again assumed almost similar
volumes and evaporated fully without falling off the hole. This behavior
was not observed with a hydrophobic substrate (silicone) with an equal
size hole. Experiments with a sessile drop on a SH plate inclined
at 30° to the horizontal and evaporated indicated shape characteristics
that had similarities and differences with the results obtained from
those of the 15 μL drop volume dispensed on the SH sheet with
a hole.
