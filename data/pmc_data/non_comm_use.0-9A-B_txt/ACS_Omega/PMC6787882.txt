The
photophysical studies of gum arabic (GA) in the presence of
urea, 1,3-dimethylurea (DMU), tetramethylurea (TMU), guanidine hydrochloride
(GuHCl), formamide (FA), acetamide (AA), and dimethyl formamide (DMF)
were carried out by monitoring the emission, three-dimensional emission
contour, and time-correlated fluorescence lifetime techniques. On
addition of only 1 × 10–3 M urea, 75.0% of
the fluorescence of GA is quenched, while the same occurs in GuHCl
at 3.0 M. FA quenched 50% of the fluorescence of GA at 5.0 M. However,
DMU, TMU, AA, and DMF resulted in a fluorescence enhancement. The
unusual fluorescence trends reveal the existence of CH...π interactions
in the proteins of GA. The experimental results and the structural
aspects of proteins in GA led us to propose that the aggregation of
polyproline helices in GA, through several CH...π interactions,
would have a major role to play in the emulsification mechanism of
GA.

Introduction
Gum arabic (GA) is
recognized as an efficient emulsifying agent
of the food industry. GA stabilizes the oil-in-water emulsions over
a wide range of pH, temperature, and ionic strength.1,2 It is considered to be the “gold standard” for beverage
emulsion manufacture as it can stabilize the concentrated and extensively
diluted flavor oil emulsions.3,4 The major advantage
of GA as an emulsifying agent is that it is a reliable emulsifier
as the emulsions stay stable for a very long time,5 while the main disadvantage is its cost. A high gum/oil
ratio (∼1:1) is required to generate the emulsions.6,7 This is because only the protein portion of the gum is directly
involved during emulsification.8,9

GA is a highly
branched, neutral or slightly acidic, polysaccharidic
complex, containing about 2% of polypeptide. The composition, structure,
conformation, and characterization of GA have been extensively explored
and reported in the literature.10−20 In general, three main fractions have been isolated by hydrophobic
interaction chromatography.12 The three
fractions (F) are arabinogalactan-peptide or AG, arabinogalactan-protein
or AGP, and glycoprotein or GP. F1 (AG) makes 88% of the gum but has
the least protein content of 1.1%. It is a thin oblate ellipsoid,
branched disclike structure15 with a molecular
weight of 2.86 × 105 g mol–1. The
branches are mainly composed of 1,3-linked β-d-galactopyranosyl
units with 1,6-linked β-d-galactopyranosyl side chains
to which there are linked many arabinosyl, uronic acid, and rhamnose
residues,15,16 where an approximately 43 amino acid residue
peptide sequence was supposed to be totally buried. Circular dichroism
(CD) studies reveal that the peptide in the AG fraction had no secondary
structures.21 F2 (AGP) makes 10.3% of the
gum with a protein content of 9%. It is a linear chain with branched
building blocks, which has been described in terms of a wattle blossom
macromolecular assembly.22 The AGP consists
of polysaccharide domains of Mw ∼1.8 × 106 g
mol–1 held together by a short polypeptide backbone
chain of approximately 250–400 amino acids. The presence of
secondary structures, PPII helices, and β-strands was identified
by circular dichroism studies.21 F3 (GP)
makes 1.3% of the gum with a protein content of 24.6%. It consists
of spheroidal ringlike monomers of hydroxyproline (Hyp)-arabinogalactan
(AG) subunits and more anisotropic oligomers resulting from monomer
self-association (MW, 2.95 × 105 g mol–1). At the molecular level, the GP fraction has secondary structures
mainly made of β-sheets and turns but to a lesser extent of
PPII and α-helices.21,23

It is reported
that the AGP fraction determines the emulsifying
and interfacial properties of the gum.8,9 In this study,
the protein microenvironment of GA is explored to find an explanation
for the emulsifying ability of GA. The urea derivatives, amide derivatives,
and GuHCl are common protein denaturants. The denaturation of the
proteins in GA by urea, 1,3-dimethylurea (DMU), tetramethylurea (TMU),
guanidine hydrochloride (GuHCl), formamide (FA), acetamide (AA), and
dimethyl formamide (DMF) was monitored using fluorescence spectral
techniques.

Denaturation of many proteins by urea and guanidine
hydrochloride
(GuHCl) has been reported in the literature.24−26 The goal of
such studies is to obtain an insight into the stabilization mechanism
and the folding process of the proteins. Initial studies report two
models for urea-induced denaturation. In the first one, direct interactions
between urea and the protein backbone are considered.27−31 The second model is based on the indirect interactions, where urea-induced
changes in the water structure drive the unfolding process.32−34 Down the years, the direct interaction model gained increased acceptance31,34−39 in the scientific community. However, recent studies performed using
the molecular simulation signify that urea denatures the proteins
mainly by destabilizing the hydrophobic interactions than by forming
hydrogen bonds with the protein backbone.40,41 On the other hand, the unfolding mechanism of GuHCl is associated
with the Coulombic interaction between GuHCl and the protein. The
charged Gu+ and Cl– ions denature the
protein by masking the positively and negatively charged amino acid
side chains.42,43

A wide range of research
activities are being carried out for many
decades to understand the emulsification mechanism of GA. Many reports
have suggested that the presence of aggregations and the hydrophobic
interactions in the protein microenvironment of the gum could be the
reason for its remarkable emulsifying properties. Herein, by exploring
the protein microenvironments of GA using photophysical studies, we
propose that these aggregations are primarily caused by the hydrophobic
CH...π interactions. The study further elaborates on the role
of CH...π interactions in the emulsifying ability of GA.

Results
and Discussion
Emission Studies
Fluorescence measurements
of GA in
the presence of various denaturing agents were carried out (Figure 1A–F). The
emission spectrum of GA exhibits a maximum at 315 nm, which is attributed
to tyrosine amino acid.44,45 On addition of 1.0
× 10–3 M urea (Figure 1A), 75% of the emission intensity, centered
at 315 nm, is quenched, which is accompanied with a shoulder at 350
nm and a new emission at 450 nm. Interestingly, GuHCl (Figure 1B) quenches the fluorescence
gradually reaching a 75% quenching at 3.0 M. A similar observation
was made for FA (Figure 1C), but only 50% of the fluorescence of GA was quenched by 5.0 M
FA. The fluorescence of GA in the presence of DMU (Figure 1D), TMU (Figure S1), AA (Figure 1E), and DMF does not exhibit any quenching phenomenon, rather
resulted in an enhancement of fluorescence accompanied with a significant
red shift and an increasing tail region at around 450 nm, but no distinct
peaks at 450 nm were observed.

Figure 1 Emission spectra of GA (2.86 × 10–6 M) in
the absence and presence of various concentrations of (A) urea, (B)
GuHCl, (C) FA, (D) DMU, (E) AA, and (F) TMU.

The emission spectrum of GA in the presence of urea and GuHCl shows
that [urea]3/4 = 1.0 × 10–3 M, [GuHCl]3/4 = 3.0 M, and [FA]1/2 = 5.0 M. As 88.0% of the
gum is made of the AG fraction, which does not fluoresce,21 the fluorescence observed for GA is mainly attributed
to the tyrosine amino acid present in AGP and GP fractions of GA.
In particular, the fluorescence is reported to arise predominantly
from Tyr amino acid.44,45 Had urea brought about the quenching
of fluorescence by disturbing the polysaccharides in GA, a similar
emission trend should be expected for FA as well because FA has a
structure quite similar to that of urea. Since FA quenches the fluorescence
gradually and urea quenches very rapidly, the disruptions in the polysaccharide
sequence by FA and urea could not be the major reason for quenching.
We rather presume that the solutes disrupt the protein sequence of
GA.

The ability of the urea derivatives to disrupt the water
molecules
to trigger the indirect denaturing mechanism follows the order TMU
> DMU > urea.46 Quenching is observed
for
urea, while a red shift accompanied with fluorescence enhancement
is observed for DMU and TMU (Figure 1D,F). Had the quenching in urea was due to the solute
indirect or direct interaction with the protein backbone, a similar
observation would have been expected for DMU and TMU as well. This
clearly reveals that urea is not interacting with the protein backbone
but rather attacks the tyrosine amino acid present in the protein
sequence directly.

A report suggests that urea denatures protein
by binding favorably
to hydrophobic amino acid side chains.40,41 The occurrence
of 75% fluorescence quenching in GA on addition of a very low concentration
of (1.0 × 10–3 M) urea clearly reveals that
urea directly attacks the tyrosine amino acid in the protein sequence
of the AGP and GP fractions of GA. The prominent red-shifted peak
at such a low concentration of urea signifies its strong interaction
with the tyrosine amino acid. The trend in the fluorescence spectra
of GA in the presence of urea, FA, and GuHCl clearly reveals that
urea is making a unique interaction with the aromatic amino acids
of GA. To obtain a plausible explanation and a concrete mechanism
for the unusual behavior of urea, the protein structure of GA was
explored in detail.

The amino acid composition of GA is reported
in the literature.21 Hydroxyproline (Hyp)
is the most abundant followed
by serine, proline (Pro), and threonine and many other amino acids
in minor quantities. Because of the conformational properties of Pro
and Hyp, it has been suggested that polyproline II helix (PPII) is
a dominant conformation in the structure of the proline-rich regions
in proteins.47 CD studies of GA reveal
the presence of PPII helices.21,48 A PPII helix is a type
of protein secondary structure, which occurs in proteins comprising
repeating Pro and/or Hyp residues49 (Figure 2A). A left-handed
PPII helix is formed when sequential residues all adopt (φ,
ψ) backbone dihedral angles of roughly (−75, 150°)
and have trans isomers (Figure 2A) of their peptide amide bonds.50 The PPII helix because of its extended character is relatively open
and has no internal hydrogen bonding, as opposed to the more common
helical secondary structures, the α-helix and β-helix.51,52 There are several reports on the importance of the PPII helix for
the functional and structural machinery of peptides and proteins.47,53−56 PPII helices play a major role in protein–protein53,57 as well as protein–nucleic acid51,58 interactions.

Figure 2 (A) PPII helix with trans amide bonds. (B) CH...π
interactions
between a two-amino acid (Pro and Hyp) peptide and tyrosine.

Aromatic amino acid residues (tryptophan (Trp),
phenylalanine (Phe),
and tyrosine (Tyr)) are relatively rare within the PPII helix, but
they are known to play a unique role in the structure and function
of the protein.59,60,63 Proline and aromatic amino acid residues can interact favorably
with each other.64−66 When aromatic amino acid residues occur in a proline-rich
sequence, there is a very high population of cis amide bonds due to
multiple aromatic proline interactions.64,65,67−69 Nature selects against aromatic
residues in proline-rich domains, which are usually PPII helices that
accommodate only a trans amide bond.70 Hence,
the possibility of the presence of aromatic residues in PPII helices
is more in the terminals of a PPII helix or in adjacent protein molecules.
The frequency of interactions in globular proteins increases when
the Pro and aromatic residues occur in near vicinities. There are
also well-documented examples in complexes where Pro is in one polypeptide
chain and the aromatic amino acid in another. The high content of
both Pro and Hyp (imino acids) on the surface of the collagen triple
helix has been found to interact favorably with available Phe residues
in adjacent molecules.61−64,71,72

The unusual affinity between proline and aromatic amino acids
is
termed as CH...π interactions.73,74 The proline
and hydroxyproline amino acids take a ring form (Figure 2B) due to their two-point connection
of the side chain to the electron-withdrawing protein backbone. The
Cα and Cδ (Figure 2B) are the most acidic as they are present adjacent to the
backbone amide, and they act as potent hydrogen bond donors. Thus,
the electron-rich aromatic amino acids interact favorably with the
partially positive Hα and Hδ. These CH...π interactions
are sometimes referred to as CH...π hydrogen bonds.71,74 Since both the aromatic ring and the proline ring possess CH groups,
CH...π interactions are also considered as hydrophobic interactions.73

The predominant fluorophore in GA is reported
to be the tyrosine
amino acid.44,45 L-tyrosine amino acid, in general,
exhibits a fluorescence maximum at 305 nm and is prone to red shift
due to hydrogen bonding interactions.75−79 The occurrence of fluorescence maximum at 315 nm
for GA signifies that the fluorophores (Tyr, Phe) are probably involved
in CH...π and π-π interactions. There are also several
lines of evidence reported in the literature for the presence of molecular
associations and aggregations in GA primarily in the AGP fraction.
Initially, Sanchez et al. reported some rheological evidence for self-association
of the molecules in aqueous solution of GA.80 Reports suggested that molecular assemblies are internal structural
characteristics of AGP.81,82 The statement was further
seconded by Renard et al.22 In addition,
spray-drying was found to increase the molecular weight of the AGP
fraction due to AGP aggregations.83 Recently,
Evans et al. reported a high adsorbed amount of GA on the limolene
oil droplets and it was interpreted to be due to some multilayer adsorption.84 This observation was envisaged by Dickinson85 to be due to significant intermolecular association
within the adsorbed layer. The aggregations reported to be present
in the AGP fraction are presumed to be the aggregations of several
PPII helices occurring due to multiple CH...π interactions.
The proline and hydroxyproline (imino acids) amino acids in GA together
make approximately 300 residues, while the aromatic amino acids phenylalanine
and tyrosine together make approximately 50 residues. Owing to the
high concentration of imino acids, it can be presumed that all of
the aromatic amino acids are involved in the favorable CH... π
interactions. The fluorescence emission trends of GA in the presence
of various solutes further support the assumption.

Recent studies
suggest that urea denatures the protein by binding
favorably to hydrophobic side chains.40,41 According
to the mechanism, urea molecules replace water in the first shell
around peptides. Urea has a planar distribution of charges, which
enables it to occupy positions that are inaccessible to water.87,88 Hence, it is predicted that urea unfolds the protein by masking
the hydrophobic interactions between the aliphatic and aromatic amino
acid side chains.

The interactions between hydrophobic CH groups
present in the hydrocarbon
molecules are referred to as hydrophobic interactions. The interactions
between aliphatic amino acids and aromatic amino acids fall into this
category. The hydrophobic molecules, as the name suggests, detest
water molecules and hence group together by inducing interactions
among themselves. The hydrophobic interaction can be amplified by
the π...π interaction, electrostatic interaction, hydrogen
bonding interaction, and donor–acceptor interaction. The aromatic
amino acids have a delocalized π electron cloud. Like charges
repel, but these π...π interactions are favorable because
a dipole with a partial positive charge and negative charges may be
induced for a favorable interaction to take place. In GA, the aromatic
amino acids are involved in π...π interactions among themselves and
also in CH...π interactions with the Pro and Hyp iminoacids.
The CH...π interactions are also hydrophobic interactions because
they basically take place between CH groups. However, here there is
no requirement to induce a dipole because there already exists a dipole
between the π electron cloud and the partial positive charges
of the CH groups in the proline amino acid. Therefore, these interactions
could be more favorable than the π...π interactions. It
should be for the same reason that urea, which has a dipole existing
in its structure, is able to make a unique interaction with the aromatic
amino acid side chains in GA.

In the structure of urea, the
two NH2 moieties and the
carbonyl carbon become partially positive due to the electron-withdrawing
carbonyl group. The carbonyl oxygen bears a partial negative charge.
The distribution of partial positive charges over the two NH2 moieties and the carbonyl carbon forms a positive cloud (Figure 3A), which is able
to effectively interact with the delocalized electron cloud present
in the aromatic amino acids. The CH groups present in the proline
amino acid are reported to involve in favorable CH...π interactions
with the aromatic amino acids and also in CH...O interactions with
the carbonyl oxygen.89 The CH...π
interactions are stronger than CH...O interactions. Two aromatic amino
acids involved in π...π interactions rip apart on addition
of urea. Each aromatic amino acid individually interacts with the
positive cloud of the urea molecules. Hence, two interacting aromatic
amino acids rip with ease by two urea molecules. In the case of CH...π
interactions, the aromatic amino acid involved in CH... π interactions
with the proline amino acid rips apart with ease by a single urea
molecule. The urea molecules while interacting with its positive cloud
with the π electron cloud of the aromatic amino acid simultaneously
form a CH...O interaction with its carbonyl oxygen and the CH groups
of the proline amino acid. Hence, we can conclude that urea is more
effective in destabilizing the hydrophobic CH...π interactions
than the hydrophobic π...π interactions. The crowding
of many aromatic amino acids around a single proline amino acid, due
to the favorable CH... π interactions, is also reported in the
literature.89 In such a situation, urea,
which is capable of effectively destabilizing the CH... π interactions,
will have opportunity to sit amid several aromatic amino acids. In
GA, the occurrence of rapid quenching at a low concentration of 1
× 10–3 M can be explained to be due to the
presence of several aromatic amino acids within the quenching radius
of urea molecules. Thus, the simultaneous effective binding of urea
with aromatic amino acids and proline amino acids and the possibility
of the existence of several aromatic amino acids (signified by the
aggregations present in GA) within the quenching radius of a fewer
urea molecules should be the reason for the observed remarkably efficient
quenching.

interactions: red dotted lines, CH...π interactions; blue dotted
lines, solute interaction with amino acids. (B) Acetamide interaction
with Tyr present in the proteins where CH...π interactions are
not possible. (C) Acetamide interaction with Tyr present in the proteins
of GA involved in CH...π interactions.

A similar coexistence of amino and carbonyl groups is observed
in FA as well, which results only in gradual quenching of fluorescence
of GA (Figure 1C).
Only a single carbonyl group is present in both urea and FA. Two amino
groups are present in urea, while FA possesses only one amino group.
Hence, the observation of rapid quenching for urea can be attributed
to the presence of two amino groups in its structure. A big positive
plane can be generated in urea due to the distribution of partial
positive charges over three atoms, two amino nitrogen atoms and one
carbonyl carbon atom (Figure 3A). FA can generate only a small positive plane as the partial
positive charges are distributed over two atoms only, one amino nitrogen
atom and one carbonyl carbon atom (Figure 3A). Hence, the presence of a big positive
cloud in urea enables it to bind like a glue with the π electron
cloud of the aromatic amino acid. However, the interactions between
the small positive cloud of FA and the π cloud of the aromatic
amino acid will not be effective enough. For the same reason, FA will
not be able to rupture the CH...π interaction as easily as urea
(Figure 3A) because
the three CH groups Cα, Cβ, and Cδ of the proline
amino acid bear a partial positive charge.36 Hence, the strong interactions between urea and the aromatic acids
is the primary reason for the efficient rupturing of the CH...π
interactions and also for the rapidly quenching fluorescence.

In solution, GuHCl exists as a stable guanidinium cation and chloride
anion. The gradual quenching of fluorescence by GuHCl (Figure 1B) reveals that the guanidinium
cation does not effectively pair up with the π electron cloud
of the aromatic ring. On comparing the structural aspects of urea,
FA, and GuHCl, it becomes evident that the aromatic π electron
cloud requires a positive cloud (and not a cation) created by the
distribution of partial positive charges over at least three atoms
to make an effective interaction, and only urea was found to possess
such an assembly.

Addition of AA, which has a structure similar
to that of FA, except
for the presence of a hydrophobic methyl group in place of hydrogen,
results in enhancement of fluorescence even at very low concentrations
(Figure 1E). A similar
trend was observed for DMF as well. Even the urea derivatives DMU
and TMU (Figure 1D,F)
enhance the fluorescence of GA. Earlier studies on the BSA protein
fluorescence in the presence of DMU90 and
AA90 have reported a quenching phenomenon.
Fluorescence studies of N-acetyl-l-tyrosinamide (a model
for Tyr present in proteins) report a gradual quenching by urea and
methyl acetamide.91 In the N-acetyl-l-tyrosinamide system, only Tyr amino acids are present and
only π...π aromatic interactions are possible. Hence,
the π electron cloud in the Tyr amino acid favorably interacts
with the partial positive charges on the NH2 groups of
urea and methyl acetamide (Figure 3B), resulting in quenching of the fluorescence. In
GA, the aromatic amino acids are involved in π...π interactions
but to a greater extent are involved in favorable CH...π interactions.
From the emission results, it is obvious that only urea is able to
perturb the CH...π interactions efficiently and results in rapid
quenching. GuHCl and FA, as they do not possess any hydrophobic groups,
are able to gradually quench the fluorescence. On addition of AA and
DMU, hydrophobic methyl-group-containing systems are introduced into
the microenvironment of GA.

As conveyed by the emission trends
in the presence of various solutes,
the favorable CH...π interactions would not desire to part
that easily (unless they have the big positive plane containing urea
in the medium); hence, they attract the methyl groups present in the
solutes toward them to safeguard their favorable interaction forces.
The hydrophobic microenvironment created by the accumulation of AA
not only safeguards the CH... π interactions but also slightly
shields the fluorophores from neighboring groups that quench the fluorescence,
and as a result, AA and DMU enhance the fluorescence of GA (Figure 3C). On this basis,
we can emphasize that on adding GA to the oil/water system, the amino
acids involved in the hydrophobic CH...π interactions are naturally
attracted toward the hydrophobic oil phase, while the hydrophilic
polysaccharides protrude into the water phase, thereby forming stable
emulsions.

Phillips and his collaborators developed a series
of “Supergum”
products by subjecting the conventional GA to maturation technology.92,93 It is assumed that on maturation the proteinaceous material in GA
is aggregated and that through the formation of several cross-links
between the polysaccharide units, the low-molecular-weight AG fraction
and the GP fraction are linked to the high-molecular-weight AGP fraction,
thereby increasing the overall concentration and the molecular weight
of AGP. We speculate that initially there exist aggregations, but
all of the PPII helices and other protein secondary structures are
not in an aggregated state due to the intervening highly branched
polysaccharide units. During maturation under controlled conditions
of temperature and pressure, the agitation can bring about an increase
in the aggregation of polypeptides, which in turn may trigger the
formation of cross-links between the polysaccharide units. The cross-linked
polysaccharide units may relieve some stress, making room for more
polypeptides to aggregate, and the process should go on, ultimately
resulting in an increased concentration and molecular weight of the
AGP fraction. This aggregated matured gum is reported to have substantial
enhancement in the emulsification properties.93 We have proposed that these aggregations are occurring predominantly
due to CH...π interactions. The amino acids involved in CH...π
interactions have a unique affinity for the hydrophobic groups as
confirmed by the emission trends in DMU and AA. The greater the number
of CH...π interactions, the greater the affinity for hydrophobic
groups and hence an increased emulsification ability. Therefore, we
conclude that the aggregation of proteins in GA has a crucial role
to play in the emulsification efficiency of the gum.

We have
proposed two schemes to depict the microenvironment of
GA before maturation (Scheme 1A) and after the maturation process (Scheme 1B). The scheme brings to light how the CH...π
interactions formed during the maturation process can be the cause
of aggregation and cross-linking in GA. Studies on various properties
of the matured gums are reported in the literature, but the fluorescence
properties are yet to be explored. A comparative fluorescence spectral
study of naturally matured and industrially matured gums will reveal
important insights regarding the emulsifying mechanism of GA.

Scheme 1 (A) GA Microenvironment before the Maturation Process; (B) GA Microenvironment
after the Maturation Process
In the emission spectrum of GA with increasing concentrations of
urea (Figure 1A), the
peak at 315 nm along with quenching shows a red shift to around 350
nm and a new emission is also observed at 450 nm. A similar trend
is observed in the emission spectra for GA with increasing concentrations
of GuHCl and FA (Figure 1B,C). The emission spectra of GA in DMU (Figure 1D), TMU (Figure 1F), AA (Figure 1E), and DMF also show a prominent red shift
from 315 to around 350 nm, but there is no new emission at 450 nm.
It has been reported that an emission above 400 nm accompanied with
high lifetimes for protein molecules on denaturation confirms the
existence of fluorescing amino acids in a heterogeneous environment.94−98 GA is a polysaccharide–protein complex. The microdomains
of GA are heterogeneous due to the presence of various sugars and
amino acids. Hence, the emission at 450 nm, observed for GA in the
presence of urea, FA, and GuHCl, is attributed to the amino acid fluorophores
exposed to the heterogeneous environments in GA due to denaturation,
which was further authenticated by the three-dimensional (3D) emission
contour studies.

The predominant fluorophore in GA is the Tyr
amino acid.45 The red shift in the emission
maximum (315 to
around 350 nm) on addition of solute is attributed to the formation
of hydrogen bonds between the −OH group in Tyr and the C=O
or NH2 groups in the solutes.75−79 The lifetime decay analysis supports the formation of tyrosine hydrogen
bonding with the solute molecules.

The emission spectrum of
GA in the presence of TMU (Figure 1F) exhibited a remarkable enhancement
of fluorescence accompanied with a significant red shift, which is
attributed to the hydrophobic interaction between the methyl groups
in TMU and the aromatic amino acids, creating a water-less hydrophobic
cavity around the fluorophore. The inaccessibility of the fluorophore
and hence the impossibility of fluorescence quenching by the water
molecules and the nearby groups should explain the remarkably high
fluorescence enhancement. A similar explanation should hold good for
DMU, AA, and DMF as well. These solutes possess fewer methyl groups;
hence, they create a hydrophobic environment but not a cavity and
therefore result in moderate enhancement of fluorescence. The fluorescence
trends for GA in the presence of DMU and TMU are further ascertained
by the 3D emission contour studies.

Lifetime Studies
The fluorescence decay of aqueous
solution of GA in the presence of urea (Figure 4A), GuHCl (Figure S7), DMU (Figure 4B),
TMU (Figure 4C), and
AA (Figure S8) was measured, and the corresponding
decay analyses are provided in the supporting information (Tables S1–S5). The excitation wavelength
was fixed at 280 nm and the decay wavelength at 315 nm. The fluorescence
decay of GA is triexponential in the absence and presence of various
denaturing agents. For GA, taken as such, the lifetimes of the three
components are 0.11 (τ1), 0.97 (τ2), and 2.88 (τ3)
ns (Table S1) and the relative amplitude
percentages are 19.0 (A1), 70.0 (A2), and 11.0 (A3) %, respectively.
On addition of urea (1.0 × 10–2 M), the relative
amplitude percentages of the three components are 30.0 (A1), 35.0
(A2), and 31.0 (A3) % (Table S1). In the
presence of urea, A2 has decreased drastically. With increasing concentrations
of urea, the amplitude % does not show much variation. On addition
of GuHCl [1.0 × 10–1 M], the relative amplitude
percentages of the three components are 14.0 (A1), 74.0 (A2), and
13.0 (A3) %, respectively (Table S2). The
amplitude % was almost similar to that of GA alone. With increasing
concentrations of GuHCl, A2 decreases gradually to 34.0% at 5.0 M.
The individual component lifetimes and the average lifetimes show
only slight changes with increasing concentrations of both the denaturants.
The trend observed in the amplitude distribution in the presence of
these two denaturants reflects the trend in the emission spectrum.

Figure 4 (A) Fluorescence
decay of GA in the absence and presence of various
concentrations of (A) urea, (B) DMU, and (C) TMU.

On addition of TMU (1.0 M) to GA, the lifetimes of the three components
are 1.11(τ1), 4.51(τ2), and 26.43(τ3) ns and the
relative amplitude percentages are 10.0 (A1), 14.0 (A2), and 76.0
(A3) %, respectively (Table S4). With increasing
concentrations of TMU, the amplitude % shows only appreciable changes.
The lifetime data for GA in TMU (Table S4) clearly reveals the formation of a high lifetime component (τ1),
which supports the remarkable enhancement in the emission spectrum
and the observation of single emitting region in the contour spectrum
very well.

In all of the lifetime analysis tables, there is
one common trend
observed. The relative amplitude of component two (A2) decreases.
In the case of urea and GuHCl, there is a simultaneous increase in
component one (A1) and component three (A3). At 5 M urea and GuHCl,
there is almost an equal distribution of A1, A2, and A3. In the case
of DMU, TMU, and AA, the decrease in A2 is associated with a greater
increase in A1 than in A3. In the emission spectrum of GA in the presence
of urea and GuHCl, at 5 M, three distinct peaks (first at 315 nm,
second at around 350 nm, and third at around 450 nm) are observed.
However, the emission trends in the presence of DMU, TMU, and AA show
a peak at 315 nm, which is red-shifted at higher concentrations to
around 350 nm, and only an increasing tail region at around 450 nm,
but no distinct peaks are observed at around 450 nm. The common red-shifted
peak at around 350 nm observed in the emission spectrum of GA in the
presence of all of the solutes is attributed to the tyrosine amino
acid involved in hydrogen bonding interactions with the solute molecules.
Similarly, in the decay analysis, the increase in A1 is a common observation
for all of the solutes and so it is correlated to the tyrosine amino
acid involved in hydrogen bonding. A big increase in A3 has occurred
only for urea and GuHCl, whose corresponding emission spectra also
show an evolution of a distinct peak at around 450 nm. As stated earlier,
the tyrosine amino acid when exposed to a heterogeneous environment
due to denaturation exhibits an unusual red-shifted emission associated
with a high lifetime. The corresponding lifetime of A3 (τ3)
for GA even in the absence of any solute is relatively high in comparison
with that of τ2 and τ1. The τ3 values of GA in the
presence of various solutes register even higher lifetime values.
Hence, component A3 is correlated to the tyrosine amino acid exposed
to the heterogeneous aqueous phase. Component A2 that is present at
high percentage in GA alone (A2 = 70%) is correlated to the tyrosine
amino acid in its native state in GA.

Three-dimensional Emission
Contour Studies
To gain
further insight into the microenvironment, 3D emission contour studies
were performed for GA in the presence of various solutes. In the contour
spectra of GA alone (Figure 5A), two major regions are observed. The first region (R1)
corresponds to the excitation centered at 280 nm and emission centered
at 315 nm. The second region (R2) corresponds to the excitation centered
at around 400 nm and emission at 450 nm. R1 shows a strong fluorescence
intensity, and R2 shows a weak fluorescence intensity. On addition
of (1.0 × 10–3 M) urea (Figure 5B), the fluorescence intensity decreases
at R1 and increases at R2. Thus, the fluorescence at R2 arises from
fluorophores in the denatured protein exposed to the heterogeneous
environment. A similar observation was made for GA in the presence
of GuHCl (Figure S1).

Figure 5 (A) Three-dimensional
(3D) emission contour spectrum of GA (2.86
× 10–6 M). Three-dimensional (3D) emission
contour spectra of GA (2.86 × 10–6 M) in the
presence (B) of urea (1.0 × 10–3 M) and (C)
of TMU (1 × 10–1 M).

In the contour spectra of GA in the presence of DMU (Figures S2–S4), the intensity of R1 increases
and that of R2 decreases with increasing concentrations of DMU. On
addition of TMU to GA (Figures 5C and S5,S6), even at low concentrations
(Figure 5C), the region
R2 completely disappears and only one region R1 is present. The observation
of only one emitting region on addition of TMU signifies the aggregation
of TMU (through the hydrophobic -CH3 groups) around the hydrophobic
aromatic amino acids, creating a homogeneous microenvironment around
the fluorophore. This phenomenon ascertains the fact that when the
microenvironment around the aromatic amino acid is same, it emits
in one region only, but when it is exposed to a heterogeneous microenvironment,
the tyrosine amino acid shows several unusual red-shifted emissions.
In the contour spectra of GA in the presence of DMU (Figure S2), the intensity in R2 is higher than that in GA
alone (Figure 5A).
This reveals that DMU denatures the proteins and the fluorophores
are exposed to the heterogeneous phase, but as the concentration of
DMU increases, the immediate environment of the fluorophore becomes
homogeneous and detached from the external environment. As a result,
we observe enhancement in the emission spectra and a single emitting
region in the contour spectra. Hence, it becomes obvious that DMU
and TMU safeguard the aromatic amino acids in the proteins, while
they still denature the proteins by interacting with the protein backbone
probably through an indirect mechanism.

Conclusions
The
present investigation examines the
fluorescence spectral properties of GA in the presence of urea, DMU,
TMU, FA, AA, and DMF. The quenching phenomenon observed for GA in
the presence of urea, FA, and GuHCl is attributed to the interaction
between the aromatic π system, present in the tyrosine amino
acid in the proteins of GA, and the partially positive NH2 groups in urea, FA, and GuHCl. The enhancement of fluorescence observed
for GA in the presence of DMU, TMU, AA, and DMF is attributed to the
hydrophobic interactions between the aromatic system of the tyrosine
amino acid and the CH3 groups in DMU, TMU, AA, and DMF.
The two unusual trends, that is, (i) the rapid quenching of fluorescence
of GA by urea and (ii) the enhancement of fluorescence of GA by AA
and DMU, enabled us to reveal the presence of CH...π interactions
in GA. The affinity of the amino acids involved in CH...π interactions
for the hydrophobic groups, as confirmed by the enhancement of fluorescence
of GA by AA, is speculated to be the major driving force for the emulsification
ability of GA. The increase in efficiency of the emulsification properties
of the matured GA was owed to the increased aggregations of PPII helices
through the favorable CH...π interactions during the maturation
process.

Materials and Experimental Methods
Sample Preparation
The acacia gum (gum arabic) laboratory-grade
sample (CAS No 9000-01-05) was purchased from Merck. A 2.0% (w/v)
solution of GA was prepared. Urea (molecular biology grade) was obtained
from Merck Chemicals, India. The urea derivatives 1,3-dimethylurea
and tetramethylurea were purchased from Alfa Aesar Chemicals, U.K.
GuHCl was purchased from Merck. FA and DMF were obtained from Qualigens,
India Ltd. AA was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Solutions of GA and
the solutes were prepared in triple distilled water.

Steady-State
Fluorescence Measurements
The fluorescence
emission and 3D spectral measurements were performed in a Fluoromax
4 P spectrofluorimeter (Horiba Jobin Yvon) using fluorescence software
provided by the manufacturer. 3D contour plots were obtained by simultaneously
scanning the excitation and emission monochromators.

Time-Correlated
Single-Photon Counting Technique
The
fluorescence decay measurements of GA solutions were recorded using
an IBH time-correlated single-photon counting spectrometer with a
microchannel plate photomultiplier tube (MCP-PMT) (Hamamatsu R3809U)
as a detector and a 280 nm LED (Spectra Physics) as an excitation
source.
