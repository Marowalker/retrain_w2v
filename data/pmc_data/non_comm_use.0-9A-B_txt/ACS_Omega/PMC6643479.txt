The synthesis of hydroxenin monoacetate,
a key intermediate in the manufacture of vitamin A, relies on the
undesirable use of stoichiometric amounts of organic bases such as
pyridine. Although the final product (vitamin A acetate) can be produced
from hydroxenin diacetate, using the monoacetylated intermediate improves
the overall process yield. Aiming to identify more efficient, environmentally
benign alternatives, this work first studies the homogeneous acetylation
reaction using pyridine. The addition of the base is found to enhance
the rate of hydroxenin monoacetate formation, confirming its catalytic
role, but also yields non-negligible amounts of hydroxenin diacetate.
On the basis of these insights, Mg- and Al-containing hydrotalcites
are explored because of their broad scope as base catalysts and the
ability to finely tune their properties. The reaction kinetics are
greatly enhanced via controlled thermal activation, forming high surface
area mixed metal oxides displaying Lewis basic sites. In contrast,
a Brønsted basic material synthesized by the reconstruction of
a mixed oxide performs similarly to the as-synthesized hydrotalcite.
Variation of the Mg/Al ratio from 1 to 3 has no significant impact,
but activity losses are observed at higher values because of a reduced
number of basic sites. After optimizing the reaction conditions, hydroxenin
monoacetate yields >60% are obtained in five consecutive cycles
without the need for any intermediate treatment. The findings confirm
the potential of hydrotalcite-derived materials as highly selective
catalysts for the production of vitamins with reduced levels of organic
waste.

1 Introduction
Vitamins
were recognized as essential micronutrients at the start of the 20th
century.1 In line with continued economic
development, an increased demand for nutritional products is forecast
in the coming years.2 Current production
routes still generally use stoichiometric amounts of soluble reagents.
However, the increasing pressures on resources and the environment
are driving a search for more sustainable alternatives, including
the transition from batch to continuous and from stoichiometric to
catalytic processes, and the substitution of soluble reagents with
solid alternatives.3−5 Despite dedicated efforts to implement heterogeneous
catalysts, their application in vitamin production is still limited
because of the challenges in attaining highly selective conversions
of complex compounds.5−8 Furthermore, companies aim to develop unique synthetic routes to
generate intellectual property.9 For example,
up to five different processes, each with distinct intermediates,
have been developed for the production of vitamin A, which is important
for many biological functions including growth, immunity, vision,
and reproduction.1,10

Hoffmann-La Roche first
commercialized a process for the production of the more stable vitamin
A acetate derivative in the 1950s.1,10 As seen in Scheme 1, hydroxenin is obtained
via several carbon elongations starting from β-ionone. Even
though the final product can be synthesized from the diacetylated
intermediate, higher yields of the dehydration/elimination step can
be obtained when using the pure monoacetate derivative.11,12 The first patented procedure for the acetylation of hydroxenin (Scheme 1, boxed reaction)
required large amounts of pyridine and used acetyl chloride or acetic
anhydride as acetylating agents.13,14 Although equimolar
amounts of base are required, the specific chemical function of pyridine,
either as a proton scavenger or as a nucleophilic catalyst, has never
been elucidated. To improve the process efficiency and reduce waste
formation, a continuous enzyme-catalyzed acetylation was pursued.11,12 However, despite achieving very high levels of conversion, it has
only been demonstrated on a pilot scale, the addition of a base and
antioxidant was still necessary. Furthermore, enzyme activity deteriorated
substantially without the aid of a Na4EDTA precolumn. On
the basis of the reaction type, hydrotalcites and their derived mixed
metal oxides could be suitable replacements for pyridine, as these
materials are promising base catalysts in various chemical transformations.15−28 Several works have reported their application in transesterification
reactions,22−28 which are closely related to the targeted acetylation of hydroxenin.
These works have identified the importance of optimizing the surface
area and number of basic sites of the hydrotalcite via thermal activation.
Furthermore, the type of active center was reported to have a critical
impact; the introduction of Brønsted basicity through the reconstruction
of thermally decomposed hydrotalcites with water vapor resulted in
decreased conversion in the transesterification of lipids.25 Little attention has been given toward selective
transformations of complex molecules, such as in the synthesis of
vitamin A.

Scheme 1 Synthesis of Vitamin A Acetate Developed by Hoffmann-La
Roche Starting from β-Ionone1,10
Boxed step indicates the reaction targeted in this study. The formation
of the diacetate derivative may lead to a significant reduction in
the final product yield.

In this study, the
use of solid bases is demonstrated for the first time in the selective
acetylation of an industrially relevant vitamin A intermediate. To
gain an insight into the reaction mechanism, the acetylation of hydroxenin
in the presence of pyridine is first investigated. On the basis of
these results, synthesis–property–performance relations
are assessed over hydrotalcite-based materials through variation of
the activation conditions and metal content (Scheme 2). After maximizing the monoacetate yield
through tuning of the reaction parameters, the stability of the best
performing material is evaluated. Hydroxenin monoacetate yields >60%
are evidenced during five consecutive batch tests without intermediate
treatment of the catalyst.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Chemical
Function of the Homogenous Base
To design a solid replacement,
it was first necessary to investigate the acetylation of hydroxenin
in the presence of pyridine—one of the most active organic
bases currently applied.29 This was approached
by monitoring the conversion and product yield during batch experiments
following a representative lab-scale procedure (Figure 1a). The solvent, reactant, base, and products
could be clearly identified by high-performance liquid chromatography
(HPLC), as illustrated for representative catalytic tests in Figure S1. A conversion of above 80% is evidenced
in the presence of pyridine, which is over 10 times higher than that
observed in the blank reaction in the absence of any base (8%). Comparison
of the product yields reveals non-negligible formation of the diacetylated
product (ca. 20%). To understand this result, the acetylation of hydroxenin
monoacetate was also studied. Once again, higher conversion (ca. 4
times) toward hydroxenin diacetate (>25% yield) results in the
presence of pyridine (Figure 1b).

Figure 1 Impact of pyridine on the acetylation of (a) hydroxenin or (b)
hydroxenin monoacetate using acetic anhydride as an acetylating agent:
conversion (black bars) and product yields (colored bars). Conditions: T = 303 K, t = 4 h, V =
10 cm3, nhydroxenin or nhydroxenin monoacetate = 3.3 mmol, nacetic anhydride = 4.3 mmol, and npyridine = 2.6 mmol (where applied).

The observations are consistent with pyridine having
a dual function both as a base and as a nucleophilic catalyst, converting
acetic anhydride 1 into a more active acetylating agent 2.30 This species is able to react
with the secondary alcohol producing more appreciable amounts of diacetate
(Scheme 3). Although pyridine is applied in
close to stoichiometric quantities, the highly enhanced kinetics
in the presence of this base and the fact that it is not consumed
in the reaction suggest that the acetylation is base catalyzed. Indeed,
estimation of an apparent turnover number with respect to pyridine
yields a value greater than 1, even when considering the expected
uncatalyzed conversion based on the blank experiment. Additionally,
the formation of intramolecular hydrogen bonds in the hydroxenin molecule
(3) could also have a stabilizing effect, reducing the
activity in the blank reactions.31 No acetylation
was observed when acetic acid was used, as this neutralizes pyridine,
supporting this hypothesis. The intention to replace this homogeneous
base with a solid catalyst could also improve the acetylation selectivity.

with Acetic Anhydride and Pyridine
2.2 Design of a Heterogeneous Base Catalyst
To develop a heterogeneous alternative to the use of organic bases
in this reaction, we turned to hydrotalcites, that is, layered double
hydroxides with the formula [Mgn2+Alm3+(OH)2(n+m)]m+[CO32–]m/2·xH2O. The wide synthetic tunability of these
compounds enables assessment of the impact of different variables
(e.g., the type, number, and strength of basic sites) on the activity
(Scheme 2).32−34 To identify key parameters for the conversion of hydroxenin, a hydrotalcite
with a nominal Mg/Al ratio of 3 (denoted HT3) and containing carbonate
anions was initially synthesized (Table S1). X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns reveal the characteristic reflections
of a rhombohedral (3R) layered double hydroxide structure (Figure 2a) and the porous
properties determined by nitrogen adsorption agree with previous studies
(Figure 2b and Table S2).35,36

Figure 2 (a) XRD patterns and
(b) porous properties of HT3, the mixed metal oxides obtained upon
its thermal activation at different temperatures, and the hydrotalcite
prepared by reconstruction of MMO3-973 (see arrow). Phase assignment
was achieved with respect to reference patterns reported in the crystallographic
open database: hydrotalcite (9009272), MgO (100053), and MgAl2O4 (9005807).

Thermal activation of HT3 at temperatures in the range from
673 to 1273 K resulted in the formation of the mixed metal oxides
(MMOx-y) as evidenced by the relatively
broad reflections centered at 43 and 62° 2θ (Figure 2a). As expected, reflections
corresponding to the MgAl2O4 spinel phase appear
in the diffractogram of the sample heated to 1273 K, indicating the
loss of the mixed oxide structure.37 The
evolution of porous properties upon thermal activation is consistent
with previous observations (Figure 2b). The surface area reaches a maximum value of 161
m2 g–1 at 973 K, subsequently showing
a marked drop upon formation of the spinel phase (55 m2 g–1). An advantage of these materials for the
conversion of bulky substrates is their mesoporous character (the
average pore diameter in the MMO3-y samples varied
between 11 and 14 nm, Table S1), which
ensures a large accessible surface area. The 27Al magic
angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance (MAS NMR) spectra confirm
the transition toward the mixed oxide, as more tetrahedral (Td) Al species are formed with
an increasing temperature (Figure S2).37 However, splitting of the signal at 71 ppm is
indicative of some phase segregation of aluminum in the MMO3-1273
sample.38,39 The controlled reconstruction of the hydrotalcite-derived
mixed metal oxides in decarbonized water permits the formation of
the carbonate-free hydrotalcite, meixnerite, which contains hydroxide
anions originating Brønsted basic sites (Scheme 2).40 The successful
reconstruction of MMO3-973 leading to r-HT3 was evidenced by XRD,
and the material exhibits similar porous properties to the as-synthesized
HT3 (Figure 2). Elemental
analysis indicated a carbon content (0.7 wt %) much lower than that
expected for a fully carbonate-exchanged hydrotalcite of this composition
(i.e., 1.52 wt %, see Table S1). The complete
elimination of carbon from these materials is very difficult to achieve
because of the rapid adsorption of CO2 upon exposure to
air, but the value is sufficiently low to consider that the majority
of charge-balancing anions have been replaced by hydroxide groups
and that residual ethanol is unlikely to play a significant role.41

The performance of hydrotalcites and derived
materials was evaluated under equivalent conditions as applied for
pyridine (Figure 3a).
The results confirm a noticeably increased activity over HT3 compared
to the blank test (Figure 1).35,42 Thermal activation of this hydrotalcite
leads to enhanced catalytic properties; the sample treated at 973
K reaching a conversion of 45% and a monoacetate yield of 41%. This
suggests that the increased surface area of these materials, and the
expected presence of higher concentrations of Lewis basic sites,46 is beneficial for the performance in the reaction.
In comparison, r-HT3 displayed a similar activity to the as-synthesized
hydrotalcite with a monoacetate yield of 19%, indicating that the
presence of Lewis basic sites is more influential in this reaction.
In all cases, the diacetate yield remained below 2%, illustrating
the highly selective nature of these materials in acetylation reactions.
It is worth noting that prolonged exposure of the mixed metal oxides
to ambient conditions resulted in a gradual decrease of the activity.
For example, the hydroxenin conversion over MMO3-973 dropped by approximately
40% (from 45 to 26%) if exposed to ambient conditions for 1 week prior
to testing. The activity loss could be completely reversed upon reactivation
of the material at the original temperature, suggesting that the adsorption
of carbon dioxide and water from air could lead to the partial reconstruction
of the surface, reducing the number of accessible basic sites.

conversion (black bars) and product yields (colored bars) in the presence
of HT3 and the catalysts derived by its thermal activation and reconstruction.
The performance of the basic zeolite catalysts is shown for comparison.
(b) Performance as a function of the combined amount of medium and
strong basic sites in the mixed metal oxides of varying Mg/Al ratio
activated at 973 K. Conditions: T = 303 K, wcat = 250 mg, nhydroxenin = 3.3 mmol, nacetic anhydride =
4.3 mmol, V = 10 cm3, t = 6 h.

Additional hydrotalcite materials
were prepared with nominal Mg/Al ratios of 1, 2, and 4. The actual
metal ratios approached these values (Table S1), and the surface area increased simultaneously with the aluminum
content in the range from 56 to 167 cm2 g–1 (Table S3). Typical layered double hydroxide
reflections are observed in the XRD patterns (Figure S3) and move to higher 2θ values upon increasing
the Al content, which is in agreement with the literature.43 The octahedral (Oh) symmetry of aluminum in the as-synthesized hydrotalcites
was confirmed by 27Al MAS NMR (Figure S4).44,45 As expected, peak broadening
indicates the hindered incorporation of Al into the brucite-like layers
at a Mg/Al ratio of 1. Thermal activation of the as-synthesized hydrotalcites
at 973 K yielded similar materials to the MMO3-973 sample. Enhanced
surface areas are evidenced with increasing metal ratio in good agreement
with other reported literature (Table S3).46 The crystal size is slightly increased
for higher Mg/Al ratios (4.6 nm in MMO4-973), which agrees with the
lower amount of aluminum. This material also has the highest reflection
intensity in the XRD patterns (Figure S5).20 Consistent with the greater structural
heterogeneity of HT1, MMO1-973 displays the largest peak broadening.
This is also observed by 27Al MAS NMR (Figure S6).

No appreciable influence of the metal ratio
was evidenced from the performance, with all as-synthesized hydrotalcites
achieving similar activity (Figure S7).
Basicity assessment is widely approached by the temperature-programmed
desorption (TPD) of CO2. Unfortunately, most of the thermally
activated materials still contain small amounts of CO2 adsorbed
on the surface, which can perturb the desorption profile making it
challenging to deconvolute. Thus, although as expected thermogravimetric
analysis (TGA) of the decomposition of the hydrotalcite indicates
that the removal of volatile species is essentially complete after
calcination at approximately 773 K (Figure S8),47 blank experiments, without introducing
CO2, revealed that degassing at 973 K is needed to fully
remove any adsorbed species. For this reason, and in view of the superior
performance, our analysis focused on the catalysts activated at 973
K. Examination of the CO2 desorption profiles shows that
the peaks in the range of 473–673 K become more pronounced
with increasing aluminum content (Figure S9). This region is often attributed to the existence of intermediate
(desorption around 523 K) and strong (desorption around 623
K) basic sites.46 Correlation between the
amounts of CO2 desorbed from these two centers (Table S4) and the activity illustrates the balance
among the amount and nature of basic sites on the external surface
and performance (Figure 3b), and variation of the Mg/Al ratio from 1 to 3 has no significant
impact. Note that previous studies have reported that thermal activation
above 873 K can diminish the basicity,27 but activation at lower temperatures did not lead to an
observable benefit in terms of performance.

For comparative
purposes, the performance of alkali-metal-modified zeolites, another
family of materials commonly applied as base catalysts, was also evaluated.
In particular, sodium (Na–X)- and cesium (Cs–X)-exchanged
zeolite X were prepared by standard methods resulting in materials
with typical properties (Table S5).48 Although the zeolite catalysts were also selective,
neither could match the activity of the as-synthesized hydrotalcites
(Figure 3a). This likely
reflects the fact that the active sites are primarily located within
the micropores of the zeolite crystals and the associated accessibility
constraints to bulky molecules such as hydroxenin and its acetylated
derivatives. Furthermore, the observed yields of hydroxenin monoacetate
were significantly lower than the conversions, suggesting a higher
extent of substrate or product adsorption in these materials.

2.3 Process Aspects
To improve the efficiency of the hydrotalcite-derived
catalysts, effects of the operation parameters on the monoacetylation
of hydroxenin and stability aspects were investigated. Varying the
catalyst amount from 750 to 100 mg (1 g of substrate) did not significantly
impact the performance, while below 100 mg, the conversion dropped
sharply (Figure 4a).
Greater scope for enhancing the monoacetate yield (up to 20%) was
observed upon increasing the reaction temperature from 303 to 323
K (Figure 4b), while
diacetate formation remained minimal (<2%). Appreciable deviation
between conversion and product yield is evidenced at 363 K, which
is related to decomposition of the substrates. The monoacetate yield
approaches a maximum value of 63% between 6 and 24 h and is not improved
by prolonging the reaction time, which promotes slightly increased
diacetate formation (Figure 4c). Interestingly, the amount of diacetate formed was substantially
lower than that observed in the presence of pyridine at similar levels
of hydroxenin conversion, but the selectivity to hydroxenin monoacetate
was not improved because of the degradation to other unidentified
byproducts.

Figure 4 Hydroxenin conversion and product yield over MMO3-973 as a function
of the (a) catalyst amount (T = 303 K, t = 6 h), (b) reaction temperature (t = 6 h, wcat = 250 mg), and (c) reaction time (T = 323 K, wcat = 250 mg). Substrate
amount: nhydroxenin = 3.3 mmol, nacetic anhydride = 4.3 mmol, V = 10 cm3.

The best catalyst identified, that is, MMO2-973, was additionally
evaluated in five reaction cycles to gather further insights into
its stability. The reaction volume was doubled, while maintaining
the optimal catalyst amount (25 mg cm–3), in order
to recover enough of the spent material for further characterization.
In addition, the most promising conditions were selected to conduct
this test (T = 323 K, t = 6 h).
The used catalyst was dried overnight at 338 K between runs. Remarkably,
only a minor decrease in the yield of hydroxenin monoacetate was evidenced
(<10%), while that of hydroxenin diacetate remained below 5% (Figure 5).

Figure 5 Hydroxenin conversion
and product yield in the presence of MMO2-973 over five consecutive
reaction cycles and the effect of thermal regeneration (indicated
by the red line). Conditions: T = 323 K, t = 6 h, wcat = 500 mg, nhydroxenin = 6.6 mmol, nacetic anhydride = 8.6 mmol, V = 20 cm3.

Analysis of the catalyst isolated
and dried after each run by XRD (Figure 6a) identifies the appearance of sharp new
reflections, the intensity of which increases with repeated use, that
are most evident in the 10–30° 2θ range, while reflections
corresponding to the MMO become less prominent. The multiple new reflections
cannot be readily assigned, but the potential crystallization of a
hydrotalcite-like compound intercalating the organic component appears
unlikely because of the absence of characteristic basal reflections.49,50 TGA reveals the gradual accumulation of organic material on the
solid, leading to a 48% weight loss after the first run and increasing
up to 78% after five cycles (Figure 6b). The presence of these compounds is also evidenced
by diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS, Figure 6c). Signals in the
range of 2935 and 1485 cm–1 can be assigned to C–H
and CH2 vibrations, while a peak at 3699 cm–1 indicates some OH functionality. The presence of both hydroxenin
and monoacetate on the used solid is thought likely due to the absorptions
observed at 1243 cm–1 (C–O) and 1640 cm–1 (C=C).

Figure 6 (a) XRD patterns, (b) TGA profiles, and
(c) DRIFT spectra of the MMO2-973 catalyst after consecutive catalytic
runs compared to the fresh and regenerated material. In (a), asterisks
denote additional reflections in the XRD pattern of the regenerated
material. Crystallographic open database: γ-Al2O3 (2015530). (d) TEM images of the fresh MMO2-973 catalyst
and of the material isolated after use in five catalytic runs and
subjected to oxidative regeneration.

Oxidative regeneration of the spent material restores the
initial mixed metal oxide structure, as confirmed by XRD (Figure 6a). However, minor
reflections appear in addition to those of the mixed metal oxide,
hinting at some crystallization of a γ-Al2O3 phase. After successful removal of the organic components, the expected
aggregated particle structure of the mixed metal oxide can be discriminated
by transmission electron microscopy (Figure 6d).37 Minor alterations
in crystal morphology toward more spherical structures indicate that
some restructuring may occur, which could be related to partial reconstruction
of the sample during sequential catalytic runs. The morphological
change is also reflected by slightly diminished porous properties
(Table S6), which is most noticeable from
the drop in pore volume (by 60%), although the reduction in surface
area is less significant (12%). The Mg/Al ratio of the used catalyst
was in good agreement with the pristine material (Table S6). Furthermore, the fact that the activity could be
fully restored upon thermal regeneration highlights the robustness
of this reaction in the presence of mixed metal oxides (Figure 5).

3 Conclusions
The application of solid bases as alternatives for pyridine in
the synthesis of a key vitamin A intermediate has been demonstrated.
Advantageously, hydrotalcites and derived materials comprising earth-abundant
and nontoxic elements are found to be highly selective (>90%) toward
monoacetylation of hydroxenin and active under mild conditions (T = 323 K). The controlled thermal activation of the as-synthesized
hydrotalcites to form high surface area mixed metal oxides displaying
Lewis basic sites was found to lead to significantly enhanced activity.
In contrast, a Brønsted basic hydrotalcite, synthesized by reconstruction
of a mixed oxide, resulted in a similar performance as the as-synthesized
hydrotalcite. Variation of the Mg/Al ratio from 1 to 3 has no significant
impact. After optimizing the reaction conditions, hydroxenin monoacetate
yields of >55% can be obtained in five consecutive cycles without
the need for any intermediate treatment. The catalyst can be readily
recycled and reused, and any deposited organic species can be removed
by oxidative regeneration without loss of performance, confirming
the potential of hydrotalcite-derived materials as highly selective
catalysts for the sustainable production of vitamins.

4 Methods
4.1 Catalyst Preparation
Four Mg–Al–CO3 hydrotalcites with nominal Mg/Al ratios of x = 1, 2, 3, or 4 (coded HTx) were synthesized via
coprecipitation. A 500 cm3 solution of 0.25–1.0
M Mg(NO3)2·6H2O (Sigma-Aldrich,
≥98%) and 0.25 M Al(NO3)3·9H2O (Sigma-Aldrich, ≥98%) was slowly added to a magnetically
stirred (500 rpm) solution of 600 cm3 of 2 M Na2CO3 (Sigma-Aldrich, ≥99.5%) at 298 K. The pH was
kept constant at ca. 10 through the dropwise addition of a 40 wt %
NaOH solution. The resulting slurry was aged for 6 h at 333 K under
stirring. Finally, the material was filtered, extensively washed with
deionized water to reach a pH below 7.5 in the filtrate, and dried
overnight at 338 K. The absence of residual counterions from the synthesis
was confirmed by ensuring that the sodium content in the resulting
material was below 1 ppm. The corresponding mixed metal oxides were
obtained via calcination in static air at 673–1273 K for 6
h (5 K min–1) and are labeled as MMOx-y, where x indicates the Mg/Al
ratio and y denotes the activation temperature. Reconstructed
r-HT3 was obtained via treatment of MMO3-973 in deionized water (100
cm3 per gram of solid) for 6 h at 298 K under magnetic
stirring (500 rpm). The resulting material was collected by filtration,
washed with equivalent amounts of ethanol (100 cm3 per
gram of solid), and dried under N2 atmosphere. All solids
were stored in a desiccator under reduced pressure. For comparative
purposes, sodium- and cesium-exchanged zeolite X were obtained via
three consecutive ion exchange treatments of a commercial sample (13X,
Acros Organics) with a 0.1 M solution of the corresponding metal nitrate
(100 cm3 gzeolite–1). The
resulting solids were isolated by filtration, washed with deionized
water, dried at 338 K in air, and finally calcined at 823 K for 6
h (5 K min–1).

4.2 Catalyst
Characterization
Inductively coupled plasma optical emission
spectroscopy was performed to determine the metal ratio using a HORIBA
Ultima 2 instrument equipped with photomultiplier tube detection.
Prior to analysis, samples were dissolved in 10 wt % HNO3. C, H, N analysis was undertaken using a LECO CHN-900 analyzer.
Powder XRD patterns were recorded using a PANalytical X’Pert
PRO-MPD diffractometer equipped with Ni-filtered Cu Kα radiation
(λ = 0.1541 nm). Acquisition took place in the 2θ range
of 5–70° with an angular step size of 0.05° and a
counting time of 1.4 s per step. The average crystal size was determined
using the Scherrer equation with a shape factor of K = 0.9. TGA was carried out on Linseis DSC PT1600. Analysis was performed
in the temperature range 303–973 K at a rate of 10 K min–1 under 25 cm3 min–1 N2 flow. The amount of volatile species in the used solids was
determined in air (25 cm3 min–1) by registering
the weight loss curve from 303 to 1173 K (10 K min–1). Nitrogen isotherms were recorded using a Micromeritics TriStar
analyzer. Prior to analysis, samples were degassed overnight at 423
K. The total surface area was determined by the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
equation and the pore size was determined by application of the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda
method to the adsorption branch of the isotherm. The basicity of the
solid catalysts was investigated by the TPD of carbon dioxide (CO2-TPD) using a Micromeritics Autochem II chemisorption analyzer.
The samples (0.1 g) were pretreated in a He flow (10 cm3 min–1) at 973 K for 2 h. Then, CO2 (50
pulses, 0.5 min per pulse, 1 cm3) diluted in He (10 cm3 min–1) was dosed at 323 K, followed by
removal of excess CO2 in purging He at the same temperature
for 30 min. The desorption curve was recorded by heating from 323
to 973 K (10 K min–1) in flowing He (10 cm3 min–1). Desorbed water was trapped using magnesium
perchlorate (Sigma-Aldrich, ≥98%). The concentrations of weak,
medium, and strong basic sites were estimated by multiplying the deconvoluted
area of the corresponding desorption peak with a calibration factor,
which was obtained from the decomposition of known amounts of CaCO3 (Fluka, ≥99%). Al coordination was investigated using 27Al MAS-NMR on a Bruker AVANCE 400 MHz spectrometer. Per sample,
512 scans were recorded at a spinning speed of 12.5 kHz with a 4 mm
probe head and 4 mm ZrO2 rotors. Adsorbed species in the
used catalysts were studied by DRIFTS on a Bruker Vertex 400 spectrometer
equipped with N2 cooled MCT detector and a Harrick diffuse
reflection accessory. Prior to analysis, samples were degassed in
Ar (10 cm3 min–1) for 1 h at 298 K and
64 scans were collected in the 4000–700 cm–1 range with a resolution of 4 cm–1. Transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) images were acquired using a FEI Talos F200A
instrument operated at 200 kV.

4.3 Catalyst
Testing
Acetylation reactions were carried out in a Radleys
Carousel 6+ equipped with 100 cm3 two-necked round-bottom
flasks and reflux cooling. In a typical experiment, the catalyst (250
mg unless otherwise indicated), acetic anhydride (0.44 g, 4.3 mmol,
Merck, ≥98.5%), and substrate (3.3 mmol of hydroxenin (≥97%)
or hydroxenin monoacetate (≥97%)) in p-xylene
(Acros, ≥99%) were reacted in a total volume of 10 cm3 at T = 303–363 K at ambient pressure under
time-resolved sampling. Comparative studies were carried out in the
absence of catalyst or in the presence of pyridine (2.6 mmol). Catalyst
recyclability was investigated over five consecutive reactions followed
by regeneration at 973 K. To ensure a constant total amount, the catalyst
was carefully recovered after each catalytic run by centrifugation.
Samples were analyzed using an Agilent 1260 Infinity HPLC equipped
with an Agilent Zorbax Plus C18 column and a diode array detector
(235 nm) and a water–acetonitrile gradient (0.5 cm3 min–1) at 313 K (Table S7). The conversion of substrate i (Xi) was calculated as the number of moles
of the substrate reacted divided by the initial number of moles of
the substrate. The yield (Yi) or selectivity (Si) of product i was denoted as the number of
moles of product formed divided by either the initial amount of substrate
or the total number of moles of products, according to the following
equations:      

1H (300 MHz) and 13C NMR (75 MHz) spectra of the reagents and products (Data
S1, Figures S10–S15) were recorded
on a Bruker AVANCE III instrument and are reported relative to residual
solvent: CHCl3, δ = 7.26 (1H) or 77.16
(13C) ppm. Data for 1H NMR are reported as follows:
chemical shift (δ/ppm), multiplicity (br—broad, s—singlet,
d—doublet, t—triplet, q—quartet, m—multiplet,
dd—doublet of doublets, and dt—doublet of triplets),
coupling constant (Hz), and integration.
