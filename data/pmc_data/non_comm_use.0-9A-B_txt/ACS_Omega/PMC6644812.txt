Ionic liquids (ILs)
represent the most suitable electrolyte media
for a safe application in high-energy lithium metal batteries because
of their remarkable thermal stability promoted by the room-temperature
molten salt nature. In this work, we exploit this favorable characteristic
by combining a pyrrolidinium-based electrolyte and a LiFe0.5Mn0.5PO4 mixed olivine cathode in a lithium
metal cell. The IL solution, namely N-butyl-N-methylpyrrolidinium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide
(Pyr14TFSI) dissolving LiTFSI, is designed as viscous electrolyte,
particularly suited for cells operating at temperatures higher than
40 °C, as demonstrated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy.
The olivine electrode, characterized by remarkable structural stability
at high temperature, is studied in the lithium metal cell using the
Pyr14TFSI–LiTFSI medium above the room temperature.
The Li/Pyr14TFSI–LiTFSI/LiFe0.5Mn0.5PO4 cell delivers a capacity of about 100 mA
h g–1 through two voltage plateaus at about 3.5
and 4.1 V, ascribed to the iron and manganese redox reaction, respectively.
The cycling stability, satisfactory levels of the energy density,
and a relevant safety content suggest the cell studied herein as a
viable energy storage system for future applications.

1 Introduction
Nowadays, the lithium-ion
battery powers the most efficient and
long-range electric vehicles, which actually reach an autonomy exceeding
300 km by a single charge.1,2 Further increase of
the driving range may be achieved by using the lithium battery, that
is, the system in which the anode is represented by the light, highly
energetic, while extremely reactive, lithium metal.3,4 However,
the use of this metal poses serious safety issues, including possible
thermal runway due to short circuits promoted by dendrite formation
or cell case damage.5 Therefore, safe electrolytes,
characterized by high boiling point as well as by low volatility,
vapor pressure, and flammability, play a key role in determining the
possible large scale diffusion of the rechargeable lithium metal battery.6 Among the various alternatives proposed for achieving
this challenging goal,7−11 the room-temperature ionic liquids (ILs) represent very attracting
solution because of their intrinsic thermal stability.12,13 So far, the study of the IL-based electrolytes involved aprotic
species formed by an organic cation and large anion, characterized
by low Lewis basicity. The IL composition has a remarkable effect
on several electrolyte properties, such as viscosity, conductivity,
and electrochemical stability window, thus strongly affecting the
cell performance. As for the cation, aliphatic quaternary ammonium,
including pyrrolidinium and piperidinium, and aliphatic quaternary
phosphonium have shown suitable low-voltage stability, while long
alkyl chains typically lead to viscosity increase and conductivity
decrease. On the other hand, amide and imide type anions generally
ensure high anodic stability and satisfactory Li+ transport.14−17 Recently, N-butyl-N-methylpyrrolidinium
bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (Pyr14TFSI), N-butyl-N-methylpyrrolidinium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide
(Pyr14FSI), N-methoxy-ethyl-N-methylpyrrolidinium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (Pyr12O1TFSI), and N-N-diethyl-N-methyl-N-(2-methoxyethyl)ammonium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide
ILs dissolving LiTFSI salt have demonstrated exceptional performance
in lithium-ion batteries.18,19 Among them, Pyr14TFSI revealed very promising characteristics in terms of
chemical and electrochemical stability, however with a relatively
high viscosity,18 which may lead to low
electrode wetting degree and high resistance during the electrochemical
process, reflected into high cell polarization and low capacity. This
issue may be actually mitigated by raising the operating temperature
to a value higher than 40 °C, which is a condition easily reached
in electric vehicles.20 Olivine-framework
cathodes with chemical formula LiMPO4, where M represents
a transition metal, are among the most suitable materials for ensuring
long-life and safe lithium batteries because of the relevant stability
of the phosphate (PO4) group.21 In particular, LiFePO4 is the material of choice for
commercial batteries, with a working voltage of about 3.5 V, a specific
capacity of 170 mA h g–1, and a theoretical energy
of about 590 W h kg–1.2 These characteristics lead to a practical energy density of about
190 W h kg–1 and to remarkably long cycle life.2 The energy density of the lithium cell may be
further increased by partially replacing Fe in the olivine material
with other transition metals having higher redox potential, such as
Mn (E = 4.2 V vs Li+/Li) and Co (E = 4.8 V vs Li+/Li).22,23

In this work, we study a lithium metal battery that uses Pyr14TFSI dissolving LiTFSI as the electrolyte and a LiFe0.5Mn0.5PO4 olivine-structure material
as the cathode. The electrolyte is designed with LiTFSI concentration
of 0.1 mol kg–1, which is a value lower than the
typically studied one (i.e., 0.2 mol kg–1),24 in order to keep a moderate viscosity. Prior
to use, the ionic conductivity of the electrolyte is measured, while
the lithium cell is studied at a temperature value of about 45 °C
in order to favor electrode wetting, as verified by electrochemical
impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The cell is galvanostatically cycled
at C/5 and C/3 rate (1 C = 170 mA g–1) and proposed
as a safe energy storage system combining the modified olivine cathode,
the IL-based electrolyte, and the high-energy lithium metal anode.

2 Results and Discussion
The Pyr14TFSI, LiTFSI
0.1 mol kg–1 electrolyte is studied in terms of
conductivity to determine its
applicability in a lithium battery through EIS on a symmetrical coin-cell
using stainless steel electrodes (Figure 1). The Nyquist plots of the cell at various
temperatures (Figure 1A) have the typical slope of a blocking-electrode cell approaching
90°, where the intercept indicates the electrolyte resistance.
The corresponding conductivity, measured from room temperature to
90 °C, evidences an Arrhenius trend with high values ranging
from about 3 × 10–3 S cm–1 at the room temperature to about 1 × 10–2 S cm–1 above 90 °C (Figure 1B). Nevertheless, more extended temperature
range, particularly to the lower temperatures, indicated a Vogel–Tammann–Fulcher
behavior rather than the Arrhenius one for this class of electrolytes.18 On the other hand, the electrolyte conductivity
is considered well suitable for application in lithium batteries,
as indeed expected for the pyrrolidinium-based ILs.14 It is worth mentioning that a high conductivity value and
a decreased viscosity at moderately high temperature may allow an
adequate electrode wetting for improving the cell performances.19 Therefore, we have studied our lithium cell
combining the LiFe0.5Mn0.5PO4 cathode
and the Pyr14TFSI, LiTFSI electrolyte at a temperature
of about 45 °C.

in a symmetrical stainless steel 2032 coin-cell and (B) corresponding
Arrhenius conductivity plot. Frequency range: 100 kHz to 100 Hz. Signal
amplitude: 10 mV.

The LiFe0.5Mn0.5PO4 electrode
was prepared by the solvothermal technique reported in previous works.21Figure 2A, showing the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image
of the positive electrode powder, reveals uniform sub-micrometric
platelets of LiFe0.5Mn0.5PO4 surrounded
by nanometric spherules of Super P carbon, which is used as the electron
conducting additive (see Experimental Section for further details). This morphology is generally reflected into
good electrochemical behavior of the material in the lithium cell,21 as indeed suggested by Figure 2B,C, which report the voltage profile and
the differential curve corresponding to a steady-state galvanostatic
cycle of the Li/Pyr14TFSI, LiTFSI 0.1 mol kg–1/LiFe0.5Mn0.5PO4 cell performed
at a current of about 21 mA g–1 (C/8 rate) and a
temperature of 45 °C. Figure 2B indicates a reversible exchange of 0.6 lithium equivalents
by the LiFe0.5Mn0.5PO4 material and
a corresponding capacity of about 100 mA h g–1.
This value is lower than the theoretical one (170 mA h g–1) and the value the material reaches in conventional carbonate-based
electrolyte (corresponding to a lithium exchange higher than 0.7 equivalents),21 as most likely due to a relatively low electrode-wetting
ability of the selected IL. However, the low electrode wetting by
the viscose IL-based electrolyte might not be the only parameter determining
the cell performance. Another important characteristic which may reasonably
limit the charge transfer at the electrode/electrolyte interphase,
thus the cell capacity, is the relatively low transport number of
Li+ ions expected for the IL-based solutions compared to
the alkyl carbonate- and glyme-based electrolytes because of the molten
salt nature of the ILs in which several ions contribute to the charge
transport.27 On the other hand, the low
flammability and the high thermal stability of the Pyr14TFSI–LiTFSI solution with respect to the conventional electrolytes
based on organic carbonate solvents, such as ethylene carbonate and
dimethyl carbonate,28 well justify its
use in a cell employing a highly reactive lithium metal anode. Furthermore,
the differential curve of Figure 2C reveals a reversible operation of the cell at about
3.5 and 4.1 V, that is, a higher working voltage compared to the LiFePO4 material owing to the redox activity of the Fe3+/Fe2+ and Mn3+/Mn2+ couples.22

mA g–1 (C/8 rate). Temperature: 45 °C. Voltage
range: 2–4.4 V.

The key role of the electrode/electrolyte interphase in determining
the cell behavior has been verified by EIS of the Li/Pyr14TFSI, LiTFSI 0.1 mol kg–1/LiFe0.5Mn0.5PO4 cell at temperature increasing from 23 °C
(Figure 3A), to 40
°C (Figure 3B),
50 °C (Figure 3C), and 60 °C (Figure 3D). The spectra have been analyzed by the nonlinear least
squares (NLLS) method using the equivalent circuit shown in Figure 3E. Among the various
models proposed for impedance interpretation,29 we have adopted in this work an equivalent circuit taking into account
the high-frequency electrolyte resistance, the high-middle frequency
contribution of constant phase elements (CPE1 and CPE2) and resistances (Ri1 and Ri2) ascribed
to the electrode/electrolyte interphases, and a low-frequency pseudo-capacitance
attributed either to the Li+ diffusion or the Li+ accumulation into the electrode.30 Accordingly,
the overall electrode/electrolyte interphase resistance (Ri) has been calculated considering both Ri1 and Ri2, and reported in Figure 3E as a function of
temperature. EIS reveals a significant decrease of Ri from 580 ± 60 Ω at the room temperature to
166 ± 3 Ω at 93 °C according to an asymptotic trend,
as shown in Figure 3E. We reasonably assume that the impedance drop may be ascribed to
an increase of the electrode wetting by the IL at high temperature.18 However, beneficial effects of the raising temperature
on both the ionic and the electronic conductivities of the LiFe0.5Mn0.5PO4 electrode can be also expected.31 It is noteworthy that the electrolyte viscosity
has a direct effect on both the ionic conductivity and the wetting
ability of electrode and separator, thus significantly affecting the
rate capability of lithium cells. In particular, low viscosity and
high wetting ability improve the rate capability and decrease the
cell polarization.18 We point out that
temperatures of the order of 40 °C are usually reached in electric
vehicles during driving stages or achieved by using relatively simple
heating tools in cold climate conditions. Furthermore, active cooling
systems are actually required to mitigate the battery decay due to
possible decomposition of electrolyte at operating temperature peaks,
which may lead to irregular solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer
growth upon cycling.20 Therefore, the temperature
employed in this work, that is, 45 °C, is considered a suitable
value, appropriate for efficient use of the IL-based energy storage
systems.

Galvanostatic cycling test of
the Li/Pyr14TFSI, LiTFSI
0.1 mol kg–1/LiFe0.5Mn0.5PO4 cell is performed at 45 °C using current rates of C/3
and C/5 (1 C = 170 mA g–1). The voltage profile
of the cell reported in Figure 4A reveals the above-mentioned two voltage plateaus evolving
at about 3.5 and 4.1 V, a moderate polarization between charge and
discharge, and a reversible specific capacity of about 60 and 90 mA
h g–1 at C/3 and C/5 rates. Hence, the cell using
the LiFe0.5Mn0.5PO4 electrode and
the IL electrolyte reaches the 35 and 53% of the theoretical capacity
at C/3 and C/5 rates, respectively.21Figure 4B indicates a stable
cycling trend at C/3 rate after the first cycle, which is characterized
by a discharge capacity of 66 mA h g–1 and a low
Coulombic efficiency (70%) because of partial electrolyte oxidation
to form a stable SEI layer.18 Subsequently,
the cell shows slightly lower capacity and higher Coulombic efficiency
of 98%. The capacity increases to 90 mA h g–1 and
the Coulombic efficiency slightly decreases (95%) as the C-rate is
lowered to C/5 at the 14th cycle. Hence, the galvanostatic test of Figure 4 suggests the applicability
of the adopted electrode/electrolyte combination as an energy storage
system by further improving the delivered capacity. As already mentioned,
the wetting ability of the electrolyte solution plays a crucial role
in determining the electrode/electrolyte interphase resistance and
affects the cell performance in terms of delivered capacity. Accordingly,
the LiMn0.5Fe0.5PO4 electrode has
shown higher capacity in different cell configurations previously
reported, using alkyl carbonate- and glyme-based electrolytes that
have lower viscosity than the Pyr14TFSI–LiTFSI solution.21,32,33 Thus, proper tuning the IL electrolyte
viscosity and wetting-ability, for example, by changing either its
chemical composition or the lithium salt concentration, is expected
to improve the cell performance.18 Besides
electrolyte optimization, fine material engineering might effectively
mitigate the low electronic conductivity and Li+ transport
limits of LiMn1–xFexPO4 phases, thereby further enhancing
rate capability and specific capacity of the cell.34,35

3 Conclusions
We proposed
herein a lithium battery combining a pyrrolidinium-based
IL electrolyte and a modified olivine cathode including iron and manganese,
that is, Pyr14TFSI–LiTFSI and LiFe0.5Mn0.5PO4, respectively. The electrolyte showed
a conductivity ranging from 10–3 S cm–1 at room temperature to 10–2 S cm–1 at about 90 °C. The cell delivered a maximum capacity approaching
100 mA h g–1 through two voltage plateaus at about
3.5 and 4.1 V, hence with theoretical energy density of about 400
W h kg–1 and a practical energy exceeding 120 W
h kg–1. The results evidenced the decrease of cell
impedance by raising temperature, thus suggesting the viscosity and
the wetting-ability of the IL at the electrode/electrolyte interphase
as a key factor for further improving the cell performances. Therefore,
the lithium metal cell studied in this work is considered as a new
energy storage system which may be actually improved by properly modifying
the IL to enhance the electrode/electrolyte interphase, thus increasing
cell capacity and energy density. Several IL-based electrolytes and
new cathode materials have been proposed so far.18,21 Our results suggest that alternative combinations of these materials
can actually promote the development of new, high-energy, and safe
batteries using the light and efficient lithium metal anode.

4 Experimental Section
1-Butyl-1-methylpyrrolidinium
bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide
(Pyr14TFSI, Solvionic) and lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide
(LiTFSI, Solvionic) were dried several days under vacuum at 60 and
110 °C, respectively. The electrolyte solution was prepared by
dissolving 0.1 mol of LiTFSI in 1 kg of Pyr14TFSI and further
dried under vacuum overnight at 60 °C. The LiMn0.5Fe0.5PO4 powder was synthesized by the solvothermal
pathway.21 Lithium hydroxide monohydrate
(LiOH·H2O, Sigma-Aldrich), lithium dihydrogen phosphate
(LiH2PO4, Sigma-Aldrich), manganese sulfate
monohydrate (MnSO4·H2O, Sigma-Aldrich),
iron sulfate heptahydrate (FeSO4·7H2O,
Sigma-Aldrich), and sucrose were added to a 2:1 v/v ethylene glycol/H2O solution under stirring in order to get a suspension. The
molar ratios of LiH2PO4, MnSO4·H2O, FeSO4·7H2O, LiOH·H2O, and sucrose were 1:0.5:0.5:1.75:0.03. The suspension was
sealed into a Teflon-lined autoclave and heated in an oven at 180
°C for 20 h to get a LiMn0.5Fe0.5PO4 precursor,21 which was filtered,
washed with water and ethanol, and dried in the oven overnight at
70 °C. The LiMn0.5Fe0.5PO4 precursor
was carbon-coated (about 5 wt % of C)21 by precipitating sucrose over the olivine powder in a sucrose/water
solution (molar ratio LiMn0.5Fe0.5PO4/sucrose = 80:20% w/w), and then by heating the resulting composite
at 700 °C for 3 h under an Ar atmosphere.

The positive
electrode was prepared by doctor-blade coating on
an aluminum current collector foil. The electrode slurry was prepared
by mixing LiMn0.5Fe0.5PO4, poly(vinylidene
difluoride)-hexafluoropropylene (Kynar Flex 2801), and Super P carbon
(Timcal) in the weight ratio 8:1:1 in tetrahydrofuran (Sigma-Aldrich).
The coated electrode foil was cut into the form of disks, which were
dried for 3 h under vacuum at 110 °C. The active material loading
of the electrodes was about 2.3 mg cm–2. The positive
electrode morphology was investigated by TEM by entrapping the sample
into a Formvar support. TEM images were taken through a Zeiss EM 910
microscope equipped with a tungsten thermionic electron gun operating
at 100 kV.

CR2035 coin-cells (MTI) were assembled in an Ar-filled
glovebox
(MBraun, O2 and H2O content below 1 ppm) by
using a lithium metal disk as the anode, a Whatman GF/D glass fiber
separator soaked by the Pyr14TFSI, LiTFSI 0.1 mol kg–1 electrolyte, and the LiMn0.5Fe0.5PO4 electrode as the cathode. The ionic conductivity of
the Pyr14TFSI, LiTFSI 0.1 mol kg–1 electrolyte
was measured by EIS within the temperature range from 25 to 93 °C,
by applying an alternate signal of 10 mV amplitude from 100 kHz to
100 Hz. The EIS measurements have been carried out on a symmetrical
stainless steel blocking CR2032 coin-cell, employing a Teflon ring
spacer to fix the cell constant (4.0 × 10–2 cm–1). Further EIS measurements were carried out
on the Li/Pyr14TFSI, LiTFSI 0.1 mol kg–1/LiFe0.5Mn0.5PO4 cell at 23, 40,
50, and 60 °C, by applying an alternate signal of 10 mV amplitude
from 500 kHz to 100 mHz. The impedance spectra were recorded through
a VersaSTAT MC Princeton Applied Research (PAR) potentiostat and analyzed
by the NLLS method using the Boukamp package.25,26 The Li/Pyr14TFSI, LiTFSI 0.1 mol kg–1/LiFe0.5Mn0.5PO4 cell was tested
by galvanostatic cycling at 45 °C within the voltage range from
2 to 4.4 V, using the C/8, C/5, and C/3 rates (1 C = 170 mA g–1). The galvanostatic cycling experiments have been
performed through a MACCOR Series 4000 battery test system.
