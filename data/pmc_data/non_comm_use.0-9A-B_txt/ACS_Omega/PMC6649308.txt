A novel
bifunctional ordered phenolic resin with Brønsted
acid and Lewis acid sites (Yb(OTf)2/PhSO3H-MPR)
was prepared for the first time by a two-step sulfonation and postgrafting
protocol. The Brønsted acids (benzenesulfonic acids) were transformed
from the phenyl groups that existed in the skeleton of ordered mesoporous
phenolic resin. Meanwhile, the benzenesulfonic acids can coordinate
with Yb(OTf)3 compound, resulting in the generation of
Lewis acids in the pore channels of ordered phenolic resin. Yb(OTf)2/PhSO3H-MPR sample retained large specific surface
and well-ordered hexagonal mesopores. As expected, it can promote
one-pot cascade reaction by using glucose as the reactant to produce
5-hydroxymethylfurfural with good conversion and moderate selectivity.
This synergistic catalytic performance could be attributed to its
uniformly distributed Brønsted–Lewis acids. Meanwhile,
the intrinsic hydrophobic pore surface can decrease the interference
of water solvent, leading to enhanced catalytic efficiency. Besides,
it was reused more than five times, showing good stability in water.

1 Introduction
The diminishing fossil
resource is mingling with the growing environmental
pollution, which brings serious challenges in our society. Accordingly,
biomass is believed as the prospective feedstock to produce fuels
and chemicals due to its sustainability, universality, and carbon
neutrality.1−5 In this respect, biomass-derived carbohydrates are the most abundant
and easily available platform chemicals. Therefore, substantial efforts
were undertaken to design novel approaches to convert different carbohydrates
to potential useful chemicals or intermediates.6−8 Among these
compounds, 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) has received much attention
since it can be used as an intermediate to the production of fuel
components such as alkanes and furans. Moreover, the other valuable
compounds such as 2,5-bis(hydroxymethyl)furan and 2,5-furandicarboxylic
acid can be obtained by further oxidation of HMF. All of these oxidized
products are important intermediates to synthesize the valuable polymers,
including polyurethanes and polyamides.9−14 However, HMF is mainly produced through the dehydration process
by using the costly and small quantity fructose as the starting material,
which limits its practical application in the chemical industry.

Owing to mature industrial starch fermentation process, glucose
is an abundant and cheap carbohydrate, which represents a promising
candidate for HMF synthesis.15 The major
challenge using glucose as the reactant is that the glucose ring is
too stable to transform it to HMF.16 Recently,
several groups have successfully demonstrated that the transformation
of glucose to HMF can occur via one-pot cascade reaction, including
the first isomerization and the second dehydration reactions.17−21 In the initial investigation, many homogeneous catalysts have been
used, such as metal salts, mineral acids, and enzymes.22−29 But they usually need the complicated catalyst separation treatment.
To address this challenge, a number of heterogeneous catalysts have
been tried in this one-pot transformation. However, the complex catalyst
preparation, the harsh reaction conditions, and the expensive ionic
liquid solvent are usually required in these heterogeneous catalytic
systems.30,31 Most of the previously reported catalysts
were metal oxide-based catalysts and their surfaces are hydrophilic.
In this cascade reaction, the hydrophilic water solvent easily adsorbs
on the solid catalysts, which unavoidably causes the competitive adsorption
with the reactant and this phenomenon results in the reduced catalytic
activity and/or selectivity.32−36 Moreover, it can destroy the framework of the solid catalysts, leading
to the decreased catalyst stability. To this end, solid catalysts
with suitable hydrophobicity can efficiently overcome these above-mentioned
difficulties for chemical transformations in water. But the design
of hydrophobic solid catalysts for one-pot cascade reaction of the
conversion of glucose to HMF has rarely been reported until now.

Recently, porous polymers have drawn widespread attention in different
catalytic systems owing to their controllable hydrophobicity, good
porosity, low density, and easy functionalization.37−39 To date, only
a few acidic polymer catalysts have been demonstrated for the generation
of HMF from glucose by using one-pot Brønsted acid and Lewis
acid co-catalyzed reaction.40−45 But the pore size of the previously reported porous polymers is
smaller than 2.0 nm, which resulted in the decreased active site accessibility
and the following unsatisfactory catalytic performances. In this work,
we reported for the first time on the synthesis of bifunctional ordered
mesoporous phenolic resin with Brønsted–Lewis acid sites
by a two-step sulfonation and postgrafting approach. The obtained
Yb(OTf)2/PhSO3H-MPR catalyst displayed a large
surface area and ordered hexagonal two-dimensional mesostructure.
Meanwhile, the abundant Lewis acids (Yb(OTf)2) and Brønsted
acids (PhSO3H) were uniformly dispersed in the framework
of phenolic resin. As expected, it can deliver a good conversion and
moderate selectivity in a one-pot cascade reaction for the synthesis
of HMF from glucose. Moreover, it can be reused more than five times
without a remarkable loss of catalyst activity.

2 Results
and Discussion
The fabrication procedure of Yb(OTf)2/PhSO3H-MPR material is depicted in Scheme 1. First, phenol and formaldehyde were chosen
as the
monomers to synthesize the soluble phenolic resin oligomers under
alkaline conditions. Then, Pluronic F127 triblock copolymer was used
as the template to assemble with resin oligomers by the ethanol solvent
evaporation-induced self-assembly approach, giving phenolic resin
oligomers/F127 composite. After removing the F127 template by simple
calcination treatment, ordered mesoporous phenolic resin (MPR) was
obtained. Next, MPR sample was sulfonated by reacting with chlorosulfonic
acid and the partial benzene groups in the skeleton of MPR transferred
to benzenesulfonic acid functional groups, leading to the formation
of benzenesulfonic acid-functionalized phenolic resin with ordered
mesostructure (PhSO3H-MPR). Finally, PhSO3H-MPR
was employed as the support to coordinate with Yb(OTf)3 compound, resulting in bifunctional ordered mesoporous phenolic
resin with Brønsted acid and Lewis acid (Yb(OTf)2/PhSO3H-MPR). We first optimized the amount of Brønsted acid
in the PhSO3H-MPR sample by changing the dosage of chlorosulfonic
acid, sulfonation time, and temperature (Table 1). The results showed that with the the increasing
amount of chlorosulfonic acid, the sulfur content was accordingly
increased and the content reached to 1.76 mmol/g with 7.50 mL of chlorosulfonic
acid. Then, we extended the sulfonation time (24 h) and raised sulfonation
temperature (50 °C) to achieve the highest sulfur content (1.98
mmol/g). Subsequently, in the postgrafting of Yb(OTf)3,
we adjusted the amount of PhSO3H-MPR support and grafting
temperature and the results revealed that the amount of ytterbium
was 0.249 mmol/g by using PhSO3H-MPR support and 100 mg
of Yb(OTf)3 at 60 °C for 24 h (Table 2).

Small-angle
XRD patterns of MPR and Yb(OTf)2/PhSO3H-MPR
samples (Figure 1)
showed that the as-prepared MPR sample displayed one obvious
diffraction peak associated with the other two weak diffraction peaks.
These peaks were attributed to (100), (110), and (200) planes, respectively,
which indicated that it had an ordered mesostructure with ideal two-dimensional
hexagonal porous arrangement (p6mm).46 Interestingly, Yb(OTf)2/PhSO3H-MPR material exhibited similar peaks with only
a little decreased peak intensity, revealing that it still has an
ordered hexagonal mesostructure. Moreover, N2 adsorption–desorption
isotherms of MPR and Yb(OTf)2/PhSO3H-MPR samples
were of typical type IV isotherm with H1 hysteresis loop,
revealing the existence of mesopores (Figure 2).37 Meanwhile,
the specific surface area, average pore size, and pore volume of MPR
were 343 m2/g, 3.8 nm, and 0.23 cm3/g, respectively.
Also, Yb(OTf)2/PhSO3H-MPR had the surface area
of 323 m2/g, pore size of 3.6 nm, and pore volume of 0.20
cm3/g. The slight decreases were due to the incorporation
of Brønsted acids (PhSO3H) and Lewis acids (Yb(OTf)3). Furthermore, TEM images of Yb(OTf)2/PhSO3H-MPR (Figure 3) revealed that it had one-dimensional mesoporous channels with two-dimensional
hexagonal arrangement. These results clearly demonstrated that our
two-step sulfonation and postgrafting protocol can efficiently retain
an ordered mesoporous structure of pristine phenolic resin.

Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra of the three samples
of MPR, PhSO3H-MPR, and Yb(OTf)2/PhSO3H-MPR (Figure 4) showed
that the three samples displayed strong absorption peaks around 1620
cm–1. This peak was related to the stretching vibration
of C=C bond of benzene ring skeleton, indicating that the three
samples had a similar skeleton structure. But, it was worth noting
that PhSO3H-MPR and Yb(OTf)2/PhSO3H-MPR samples exhibited new absorption peaks at 1030 cm–1, which was assigned to the S=O bond symmetric stretching
vibration, indicating the existence of benzenesulfonic acid functional
groups. For Yb(OTf)2/PhSO3H-MPR sample, the
additional peak at 1350 cm–1 was observed, which
was the C–F bond vibration. which could be explained as the
successful incorporation of Yb(OTf)3 species. These results
confirmed that both Brønsted acids and Lewis acids existed on
the Yb(OTf)2/PhSO3H-MPR sample. We further used
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra (Figure 5) to analyze the electronic states of these
samples. XPS spectrum of Yb element of Yb(OTf)2/PhSO3H-MPR sample displayed that two peaks at 186.9 and 200.4 eV
characteristic of Yb 4d5/2 and 4d3/2 binding
energies were found. These results confirmed that all of the ytterbium
species were trivalent compounds. For Yb(OTf)3 compound,
Yb 4d5/2 and 4d3/2 binding energies were 187.6
and 201.1 eV, respectively. Obviously, the binding energies of ytterbium
species in Yb(OTf)2/PhSO3H-MPR shifted negatively
by about 0.70 eV in comparison with Yb(OTf)3 (Figure 5a). This phenomenon
was maybe due to the CF3SO3- ligands in Yb(OTf)3 being replaced by the SO3H groups in Yb(OTf)2/PhSO3H-MPR, which resulted in the generation of
more electron-rich Yb(III) species.47 The
coordination reaction between Yb(OTf)3 and PhSO3H-MPR support was further confirm by S 2p XPS spectra. As shown in Figure 5b, the binding energy
of Yb(OTf)2/PhSO3H-MPR moved positively by 0.10
eV in comparison with PhSO3H-MPR. The slight change of
S 2p binding energy was maybe due to the amount of PhSO3H groups being much more than that of Yb(OTf)2SO3 groups. Therefore, we can safely confirm that Yb(OTf)2/PhSO3H-MPR sample had both Brønsted acids (PhSO3H) and Lewis acids (Yb(OTf)2SO3), as
shown in Scheme 1.

To explore the utility of our
Yb(OTf)2/PhSO3H-MPR catalyst, one-pot isomerization
and dehydration cascade reaction
by using glucose as the reactant to produce HMF was tested. The blank
experiment without Yb(OTf)2/PhSO3H-MPR catalyst
did not give HMF product (Table 3, entry 1). Then, we investigated the effect of the
solvents, including water, toluene/water, valerolactone/water, tetrahydrofuran/water,
and sec-butylphenol/water (Table 3, entries 2–6). We found that with
only water as the solvent, both the conversion of glucose and the
yield of HMF were quite low. But the addition of the polar organic
solvents was a benefit for the catalytic activity and selectivity
beacuse the two-phase solvent can efficiently transfer HMF for water
to the organic solvents, which reduces the amount of the byproducts.
The results showed that SBP/water was the good solvent for this one-pot
reaction, which delivered a conversion of 45% and yield of 21%. We
extended the reaction time to 240 min and the optimal yield reached
to 52%, which are the highest reported values using solid polymeric
catalysts. Furthermore, we compared the results with those of the
homogeneous catalysts, including H2SO4 as Brønsted
acid and Yb(OTf)3 as Lewis acid. The result showed that
the combination of homogeneous catalysts obtained inferior conversion
(80%) and yield (49%). The good catalytic efficiencey of Yb(OTf)2/PhSO3H-MPR catalyst could be related to its large
surface area and ordered mesopores, which decreased diffusion limitation
in this aqueous catalytic system. Moreover, the phenolic framework
with hydrophobicity can reduce the competitive absorption of water
solvent, leading to the enhanced catalytic activity.48 For intensive study of the hydrophobic effect, the vapor
absorption experiments by using Yb(OTf)2/PhSO3H-MPR catalyst as the adsorbent and water and toluene as the adsorbates
(Figure 6) were carried
out. We found that these two isotherms were of typical type V curves,
which indicated that there were weak absorbent–absorbate interactions.
But Yb(OTf)2/PhSO3H-MPR catalyst can absorb
more toluene (39.6 wt %) than water (19.5 wt %), which revealed that
the pore surface of Yb(OTf)2/PhSO3H-MPR catalyst
was hydrophobic.

conditions: 62.5 mg of

4.0 mL of water, and 0.25 g of catalyst.

b pH = 3.5.

Furthermore,
the hot-filtration experiment was used to make sure
the immobilized Brønsted–Lewis acid species were the real
active sites. After the reaction was conducted for 80 min, the conversion
of glucose exceeded 50%. The reaction solution was directly centrifugated
to remove Yb(OTf)2/PhSO3H-MPR catalyst and then
the mother liquor allowed to react for another 120 min under the same
reaction conditions. We found that no significant change in the glucose
conversion or the HMF yield was observed, suggesting that the catalytic
reactivity by the leaching sulfonic acid and Yb(OTf)3 could
be almost excluded in the present catalytic conditions. Also, the
mother liquid in the reaction mixture was collected after each reaction
for elemental analysis and inductively coupled plasma (ICP) test.
These results revealed that very low amount of sulfur and ytterbium
elements (less than 2.0 ppm) in the solution were detected. Moreover,
we evaluated the reusability of the catalyst Yb(OTf)2/PhSO3H-MPR by subjecting to a one-pot cascade reaction of glucose
to 5-hydroxymethylfurfural with five repetitions. As shown in Figure 7, it could be easily
recovered from the reaction mixture by simple filtration and meanwhile
the conversion of glucose and the yield of HMF did not exhibit a significant
reduction. Small-angle XRD pattern (Figure 8a) and TEM image (Figure 8b) revealed that the reused Yb(OTf)2/PhSO3H-MPR catalyst still had the ordered mesoporous
structure, which was similar to that of a fresh catalyst. Also, ICP
analysis of the filtrate confirmed that the sulfur and ytterbium species
were negligible.49 This good catalytic
recyclability was maybe due to the PhSO3H and Yb(OTf)2 acid sites existing in the framework of ordered mesoporous
phenolic resin, which inhibited the leaching of the catalytic species.

3 Conclusions
In summary,
we successfully designed a novel protocol to synthesize
bifunctional ordered mesoporous phenolic resin with Brønsted–Lewis
acid by transforming phenyl groups in the resin skeleton and coordinating
Yb(OTf)3 with the generating benzenesulfonic acid groups.
This bifunctional solid acid catalyst can efficiently catalyze one-pot
isomerization and dehydration reaction by using glucose as the reactant
to produce 5-hydroxymethylfurfural. Importantly, it was reused more
than five times without a remarkable decrease of catalytic activity.
These good catalytic performances were due to the acid species being
uniformly distributed in the skeleton of mesoporous phenolic resin.
Moreover, the hydrophobic pore surface can reduce the interference
of the water solvent. This work provides the new protocol for the
development of efficient bifunctional solid acid catalysts for more
biomass utilization.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Sample Preparation
4.1.1 Synthesis of Mesoporous
Phenol-Formaldehyde
Resin
In a typical preparation, 3.05 g of phenol was dissolved
in 20 wt % sodium hydroxide aqueous solution (0.65 g) at 40 °C.
After stirring for 10 min, 5.25 g of 37% formaldehyde solution was
added dropwise to the mixture solution. Then, the temperature was
raised to 70 °C and the solution was allowed to stir for 1.0
h under refluxing condition. After cooling to room temperature at
25 °C, the solution pH value was adjusted to about 7.0 by using
0.60 mol/L hydrochloric acid aqueous solution. The obtained solution
was further treated by rotary evaporation and diluted with four times
the volume of absolute ethanol to remove the solvents and sodium chloride,
giving pale yellow phenolic resin oligomers. Next, 1.0 g of Pluronic
F127 triblock copolymer (EO106PO70EO106) was added to 20 mL of an absolute ethanol solution containing 5.0
g of phenolic resin oligomers. The mixture solution was stirred at
40 °C until a pale yellow transparent solution was formed. Subsequently,
the mixture solution was transferred to a Petri dish and the ethanol
solvent evaporated in the oven at 40 °C for 8.0 h. Then, it was
further thermally polymerized at 100 °C for 24 h, giving phenolic
resols/F127 surfactant composite. Finally, the composite was calcinated
at 380 °C for 6.0 h in N2 atmosphere to remove F127
template, resulting in phenolic resin with ordered mesoporous structure,
which was denoted as MPR.

4.1.2 Preparation of Ordered
Mesoporous Phenolic
Resin with Brønsted–Lewis Acid Sites
One gram
of MPR was first dried at 110 °C for 6.0 h in vaccum. The dried
sample was added in 15 mL of CH2Cl2 and 10 mL
of chlorosulfonic acid mixed solution. After degassing, the mixture
was cooled to 0 °C and stirred for 12 h, followed by rising to
50 °C for another 12 h. Thereafter, the mixture was slowly added
dropwise in 200 mL of ethanol. The product was washed by ethanol,
filtered and dried, resulting in sulfonic acid-functionalized sample
PhSO3H-MPR. Finally, 1.0 g of PhSO3H-MPR and
1.0 g of Yb(OTf)3 were added into 15 mL of ethanol. The
obtained mixture was stirred at 80 °C for 24 h. Then, the solid
sample was filtered, washed twice by anhydrous methanol, anhydrous
tetrahydrofuran and anhydrous ethanol, and dried in vacuum at 100
°C for 8.0 h, generating Yb(OTf)2/PhSO3H-MPR catalyst.

4.2 Characterization
Element Vario EL
III analyzer was employed to measure the sulfur content. An inductively
coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer (Varian VISTA-MPX) was
used to calculate the ytterbium loading. Rigaku D/maxr B diffractometer
with Cu Kα radiation was chosen to collect X-ray powder diffraction
(XRD) data. Micromeritics TriStar II 3020 analyzer was used to analyze
N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms at 77 K. Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) and Barrett–Joyner–Halenda models were chosen
to measure specific surface area (SBET) and average pore diameter (DP) of different
samples, respectively. A JEOL JEM-2011 transmission electron microscope
was used to analyze the porous structure of the samples. A Thermo
Nicolet Magna 550 spectrometer was employed to collect Fourier transform
infrared (FT-IR) spectra. The Perkin-Elmer PHI 5000C ESCA system was
used to calculate the binding energy of different elements. All of
the binding energy values in the obtained X-ray photoelectron spectra
were calibrated by using C 1s = 284.6 eV as a reference. A Hiden Isochema
IGA-002 intelligent gravimetric analyzer was chosen to analyze the
surface hydrophobicity.

4.3 Activity Test
In a typical run, 1.0
mmol glucose, a certain amount of Yb(OTf)2/HSO3-MPR catalyst, 2.0 mL of tert-butylphenol, and 1.5
mL of water were mixed into a 25 mL schlenk tube. The mixture was
stirred at 130 °C for 1.0 h. Then, the product in aqueous phase
was analyzed by a high-performance liquid chromatography analyzer
(Agilent 1200 Series) with a refractive index detector and Shodex
SUGAR SC1011 column. The product in organic phase was analyzed by
a high-performance liquid chromatography analyzer (Agilent 6410 Series)
with a UV detector and Agilent C18 column. The conversion of glucose
and the yield of HMF were determined by glucose external standard
method and tert-butylphenol internal standard method,
respectively. In all of the tests, the reproducibility was checked
by repeating each result at least three times and was found to be
within ±5%.
