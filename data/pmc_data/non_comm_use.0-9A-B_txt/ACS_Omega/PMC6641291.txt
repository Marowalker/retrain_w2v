Racemic
1-hydroxy-3-butenyl-, 3-chloro-1-hydroxypropyl-, and 3-bromo-1-hydroxypropylphosphonate
and the corresponding (S)-enantiomers obtained by
lipase-catalyzed resolution of the respective racemic chloroacetates
were subjected to functional group manipulations. These comprised
ozonolysis, Mitsunobu reactions with hydrazoic acid and N-hydroxyphthalimide, alkylation of hydrazine derivative, removal
of phthaloyl group followed by intramolecular substitution, and global
deprotection to deliver the racemates and (R)-enantiomers
(ee 92–99% by chiral high-performance liquid chromatography)
of pyrrolidin-2-yl-, oxazolidin-3-yl-, oxazolidin-5-yl-, pyrazolidin-3-yl-,
and 1,2-oxazinan-3-ylphosphonic acids. These phosphonic acids were
evaluated as analogues of proline and proline analogues for the ability
to inhibit γ-glutamyl kinase, δ1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate
synthetase, and δ1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductase.
Only the latter enzyme was inhibited by two of them at concentrations
exceeding 1 mM.

Introduction
Herbicides
with favorable properties such as high activity, crop
tolerance, and low toxicity to insects and mammals are essential for
weed control in modern agriculture to secure food supply for the growing
world population.1 Furthermore, persistence
of these agrochemicals should be minimal and biodegradation by the
soil microflora should be complete in a short time span. Rapid development
of resistant weeds in combination with diffusion of the acquired resistance
in the biosphere is a public concern and has forced companies to search
for new herbicide targets and active ingredients. Amino acid metabolism
is an attractive target for herbicide development.2 However, little attention has so far been paid to interference
with proline biosynthesis. It is accessed by two routes, the ornithine
and glutamate pathways, the latter being the main one in plants. Both
the pathways share the last reaction step catalyzed by the NAD(P)H-dependent
δ1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate (P5C) reductase.3 Luckily, this fact allows to block both ways
with only one inhibitor.

Forlani and Kafarski et al. found that N-phenyl-substituted
aminomethylenebisphosphonic acids are inhibitors of P5C reductase
with activity in the micromolar to millimolar range.4−6 These compounds also demonstrated phytotoxicity in vivo, which could
be reversed by exogenously supplied amino acids.7 We reasoned that phosphonic acid analogues of l-proline and proline analogues could be inhibitors of the reductase
and other enzymes in the proline metabolism. To test this idea, a
series of racemic, chiral nonracemic, and achiral phosphonic acids
were synthesized for evaluation first with P5C reductase of plants
(Figure 1). The selection
of compounds comprised five- (1–4) and six-membered
(5 and 6) ring systems with one or two heteroatoms,
all with an attached phosphonic acid group. The (R)-configured enantiomers of 1–6 correspond to
the (S)- or l-configured ones in the carboxyl
acid series because of the higher priority of PO3H2 compared to CO2H according to the Cahn–Ingold–Prelog
rules. Many azaheterocyclic phosphonates have been synthesized and
biologically evaluated in the past.8

acid analogues of proline and proline analogues.

Results and Discussion
Synthesis of (±)-, (R)-, and (S)-Phosphaproline
Although racemic,
(R)-, and (S)-phosphaproline [(±)-,
(R)-, and (S)-1] have
been
described in the literature,9−17 we present here a new access from recently prepared racemic and
enantiomeric 1-hydroxy-3-butenylphosphonate 7 (Scheme 1).18 It also served as a starting material for phosphonic acids
racemic 2 and 6. Hydroxyphosphonate (±)-7 was resolved by lipase-catalyzed kinetic hydrolysis of the
chloroacetic ester and delivered the enantiomers with ee >97%.18 The enantiomer (S)-7 was transformed into (R)-1, (R)-2, and (R)-6 and the enantiomer (R)-7 into phosphaproline
(S)-1 by functional group manipulation.
Furthermore, (±)- and (S)-7 were
already converted to phosphaaspartic acids via azides (±)- and
(S)-8 prepared by Mitsunobu reaction.18 Evans and Weber19 and later others20,21 described the formation of pyrrolidines
from homoallyl azides upon hydroboration with dicyclohexylborane.
As we hoped that azides 8 prepared by the Mitsunobu reaction18,22 would undergo the same cylization, we reacted them with dicyclohexylborane.23 Trialkylboranes 9 were unstable
and underwent migration of an alkyl group from the boron to nitrogen
atom, with loss of nitrogen after attack of the azido group on the
boron atom.19 The phosphaproline derivatives 10 were globally deprotected by refluxing 6 M HCl. Phosphaprolines 1 were isolated by cation-exchange chromatography (Dowex 50W
× 8, H+) and crystallized. The enantiomers of 8 delivered the enantiomers of 1 of known configuration,
correctly assigned17 recently.

Scheme 1 Preparation
of (±)-, (R)-, and (S)-Proline
[(±)-, (R)-, and (S)-1]
The ee of (R)- and (S)-1 was the same
(>99%) as that of the starting α-hydroxyphosphonates 7 (>99%), which was proven by chiral high-performance liquid
chromatography (HPLC) (Figure S1).

Synthesis
of (±)- and (R)-Isoxazolidin-3-ylphosphonic
Acid
These phosphonic acid analogues of structural analogues
of proline were obtained by functional group manipulation of (±)-
and (S)-1118 (Scheme 2). Ozonolysis
gave both hydroxyphosphonates 12 in 91% yield. The following
Mitsunobu reaction22 with N-hydroxyphthalimide delivered protected O-alkylhydroxylamines
(±)- and (S)-13 in yields of 83
and 84%, respectively. Hydrazinolysis in iPrOH effected
removal of the phthaloyl group. The open-chain O-alkylhydroxylamines
(±)- and (S)-14 with a leaving
group at C-1 immediately cyclized to isoxazolidin-3-ylphosphonates 15. As the 4-nitrobenzenesulfonyloxy (nosyloxy) group was
replaced with inversion of configuration, the (S)-enantiomer
of 13 was transformed into (R)-15. The crude isoxazolidin-3-ylphosphonates 15 were deprotected with HBr in AcOH at room temperature in 16 h.24 The phosphonic acids were purified by cation-exchange
chromatography (Dowex 50W × 8, H+) and crystallization.
The overall yields of (±)- and (R)-225 starting from 13 were
79 and 74% (ee 99%, Figure S2), respectively.
Surprisingly, deprotection of 15 with bromotrimethylsilane
(TMSBr)/allyltrimethylsilane (allylTMS)26 had a detrimental effect on the yield of (R)-2 (15%).

Scheme 2 Preparation of (±)- and (R)-Isoxazolidin-3-ylphosphonic
Acid [(±)- and (R)-2]
Nos = 4-nitrobenzenesulfonyl;
DIAD = diisopropyl azodicarboxylate, PhthNOH = N-hydroxyphthalimide.

Synthesis of Phosphapipecolic Acid (±)-5
and (±)-
and (R)-1,2-Oxazinan-3-ylphosphonic Acid [(±)-
and (R)-6]
Phosphonic acids 5 and 6 differ from phosphaproline by replacing
the five-membered ring by a six-membered ring containing an additional
CH2 group or an oxygen atom. The preparation of racemic
phosphapipecolic acid was recently published.14 The synthesis of analogues 6 was accomplished starting
from 4-hydroxybutylphosphonates 16, derived from nosylates
(±)- and (S)-11 (ee 85%) by hydroboration
with H3B × tetrahydrofuran (THF), followed by oxidative
cleavage of the B–C bond with H2O2/NaHCO3 (Scheme 3).18 The Mitsunobu reaction and the ensuing cyclization
induced by hydrazine hydrate were similarly performed for the transformation
of 12 into 15 in Scheme 2 and delivered 1,2-oxazinanes (±)- and
(R)-18, cyclic oxime ethers.27 However, this time the hydroxylamine derivatives,
the two 1,2-oxazinan-3-ylphosphonates (±)- and (R)-18, were first isolated as homogeneous compounds by
flash column chromatography, fully characterized and finally deprotected.
Although the five-membered analogue 15 suffered partial
decomposition on attempted deprotection with refluxing 6 M HCl, 1,2-oxazinan-3-ylphosphonates
(±)- and (R)-18 were smoothly deprotected,
as evidenced by their high yields of 94 and 91%, respectively. The
ee of 83% for phosphonic acid (R)-6 was
increased to 92% upon crystallization from H2O/EtOH (Figure S5).

Scheme 3 Preparation of (±)- and (R)-(−)-1,2-Oxazinan-3-ylphosphonic
Acid [(±)- and (R)-6]
Nos = 4-nitrobenzenesulfonyl;
DIAD = diisopropyl azodicarboxylate, PhthNOH = N-hydroxyphthalimide.

Synthesis of (±)- and (R)-(+)-Isoxazolidin-5-ylphosphonic
Acid [(±)- and (R)-3]
For the preparation of these heterocyclic phosphonic acids, isomeric
to (±)- and (R)-2, a separate entry
had to be developed (Scheme 4). We reasoned that racemic 3-chloro-1-hydroxypropylphosphonate
(±)-20 could be the key intermediate for both isoxazolidin-5-ylphosphonic
acids, as it could be easily prepared as racemate and resolved enzymatically.
Ethyl β-chloropropionate (19) was reduced to the
aldehyde with diisobutylaluminium hydride (DIBALH) in dry toluene
at −78 °C, to which diisopropyl trimethylsilyl phosphite
was added to give α-hydroxyphosphonate (±)-20 in 84% yield in a one-pot reaction.28 Chloroacetylation with (ClH2CC(O))2O/pyridine furnished α-chloroacetoxyphosphonate (±)-21. This ester was subjected14 to
lipase-catalyzed kinetic hydrolysis in a biphasic system on a preparative
scale with 16.3 mmol of substrate. When the enzymatic hydrolysis was
stopped at 40% conversion, 5.14 mmol of α-hydroxyphosphonate
(+)-20 with an ee of 97% and (S)-configuration
were obtained, determined28,29 by using (R)-(+)-t-Bu(Ph)P(O)SH as the chiral solvating agent
in combination with 31P nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)
spectroscopy. Satisfyingly, α-hydroxyphosphonates (±)-
and (S)-20 were converted to N-protected O-alkylhydroxylamines (±)-
and (R)-22 in yields of 88 and 72% (ee
95% by HPLC, Figure S6), respectively.
Luckily, the chloride on the primary C-3 position was a much weaker
leaving group than Ph3PO and did not compete with the displacement
reaction at C-1. The cleavage of the phthaloyl group was again induced
with hydrazine hydrate. Precursors 22 were cyclized to
isoxazolidin-5-ylphosphonic acids (±)- and (R)-23, which were directly used for the next step. Global
deprotection was accomplished as outlined above. The overall yields
of (±)- and (R)-3 starting from 23 were 81 and 63% (ee 97%, Figure S3), respectively. The crystalline isoxazolidinylphosphonic acids 2 and 3 had to be stored at −18 °C
to prevent gradual decomposition at room temperature.

Scheme 4 Preparation
of (±)- and (R)-(+)-Isoxazolidin-5-ylphosphonic
Acid [(±)- and (R)-3]
DIAD = diisopropyl azodicarboxylate,
PhthNOH = N-hydroxyphthalimide.

Synthesis of (±)- and (R)-(−)-Pyrazolidin-3-ylphosphonic
Acids [(±)- and (R)-4]
Initially, we reasoned that these phosphonic acids could easily be
prepared by the reaction of a modified propylphosphonate, with leaving
groups at C-1 and C-3, with a protected hydrazine derivative, but
were convinced of the contrary. At first, 3-chloro-1-hydroxypropylphosphonate
(±)-20 was converted to triflate (±)-24 in 71% yield (Scheme 5). It was added to a mixture of N,N′-bis(Boc)-hydrazine31 and NaH in dimethylformamide (DMF), which had been stirred for 30
min at room temperature and was allowed to react for 18 h at 20 °C
and 2 h at 50 °C. The crude product, which did not contain the
starting material, was a complex mixture and was therefore discarded.
The failure of this experiment was attributed to a combination of
the low reactivity from Cl– as the leaving group
at C-3 and the high reactivity32 of TfO– at C-1. The first step, that is, the intermolecular
reaction of the deprotonated hydrazine derivative will prefer attack
at C-3. The cyclization of the N-substituted hydrazine intermediate
should easily proceed to pyrazolidin-3-ylphosphonate (±)-25, as it is an intramolecular process, and TfO– is an excellent leaving group. Substitution at C-1 of phosphonates
was first considered unlikely for steric reasons and low reactivity
in general. The size of the attacking nucleophile and the shielding
of C-1 by the isopropyl-protecting groups at the phosphorus atom disfavor
a SN2 reaction. Base-induced elimination of TfOH was more
likely than substitution. Consequently, a better leaving group had
to be placed at C-3 or/and a less reactive one at C-1.

Scheme 5 Attempted
Preparation of Protected (±)-Pyrazolidin-3-ylphosphonic
Acid [(±)-27]
To replace chloride by bromide, β-bromopropionate 26 was transformed into 3-bromo-1-hydroxyphosphonate (±)-29 and then into bromo triflate (±)-30a by
the same procedures as used for the chloro derivative (Scheme 6). It was reacted with N,N′-bis(Boc)-hydrazine in a biphasic
system33 (20% NaOH/toluene) under phase-transfer
conditions at room temperature. The extractively obtained crude product
was again a complex mixture without a starting material, but contained
elimination products as judged by NMR spectroscopy. As found later,
when we had compound (±)-25 in hand, this mixture
already contained some of it. Importantly, this experiment demonstrated
that the trifluoromethanesulfonyloxy group had to be replaced by a
less reactive leaving group such as a mesyloxy or 4-nitrobenzenesulfonyloxy
(nosyloxy) group to interfere with elimination. The corresponding
mesylate (±)-28b and nosylate (±)-28c were obtained in 93 and 86% yield, respectively, by esterification
of 3-bromo-1-hydroxyphosphonate (±)-27 with mesyl
chloride/Et3N or NosCl/Et3N/dimethylaminopyridine
(DMAP) (Scheme 6).
When the experiment with bis(Boc)-hydrazine/NaOH was repeated with
mesylate (±)-28b instead of the triflate at 0 °C
and followed by thin-layer chromatography (TLC) monitoring, no new
product could be detected besides the starting material after a reaction
time of 1 h. Then, the temperature was increased to 19–20 °C.
After 1 h, a spot of a new compound less polar than the substrate
appeared on the TLC plate, and its intensity increased with the reaction
time. After 5 h at 19–20 °C, the reaction mixture was
worked up. The 31P NMR spectrum of the crude product displayed
resonances for the cyclic phosphonate (±)-25, the
open chain product (±)-29b, a compound of unknown
structure, and the starting material (±)-28b in
molar ratios of 4:100:16:1. Flash column chromatography gave the open
chain hydrazine derivative (±)-29b in 75% yield
as a colorless gum. As expected, the first substitution occurred at
C-3, and the second one at C-1 virtually did not take place at 20
°C. When hydrazine derivative (±)-29b was heated
at 80 °C under the same reaction conditions as before except
for the higher reaction temperature, cyclization smoothly proceeded
to pyrazolidine (±)-25 and was finished after 2.5
h. Workup and purification delivered pyrazolidin-3-ylphosphonate (±)-25 in 75% yield. The reaction with nosylate (±)-29c was performed analogously (56% yield) except that the
reaction temperature for both steps was 50 °C instead of 20 °C
at the beginning and 80 °C later, owing to the nosyloxy group
being a better leaving group than the mesyloxy one. When cyclization
was carried out in DMF with KOtBu as the base for
1.5 h at 0 °C and 1.5 h at 20 °C, the yield was somewhat
higher (65%). The yield could not be improved any further despite
many experiments. It seemed likely that the partial removal of an
isopropyl group would give a water-soluble salt and thus decrease
the yield. Global deprotection of (±)-25 was more
sensitive to forcing conditions such as refluxing 6 M HCl than to
the milder conditions with TMSBr/allylTMS at 50 °C. Purification
of the crude product by cation-exchange chromatography (Dowex 50W
× 8, H+) and crystallization furnished racemic pyrazolidin-3-ylphosphonic
acids [(±)-4] in 55% yield.

Acid [(±)-4]
Nos
= 4-nitrobenzenesulfonyl,
Tf = trifluoromethanesulfonyl, Ms = methanesulfonyl.

To prepare its enantiomer (R)-4,
bromohydroxyphosphonate (±)-27 was chloroacetylated
and kinetically resolved in the same way as the chloro analogue (±)-21 (Scheme 7). Stopping hydrolysis at a conversion of 40% delivered (+)-α-hydroxyphosphonate
(S)-27 of 95% ee, as determined via
(R)-Mosher ester in combination with 31P NMR spectroscopy. This enantiomer was nosylated (ee 95% by HPLC, Figure S7) and then cyclized with inversion of
configuration at C-1 in analogy to the racemate in a basic biphasic
system mediated by a phase-transfer catalyst at 50 °C. Global
deprotection of (R)-25 delivered pyrazolidin-3-ylphosphonic
acid [(R)-4, ee 92%, Figure S4] by isolation from the crude product as for the
racemate.

Inhibition of Plant P5C
Reductase by Phosphonic Acid Analogues
of Proline and Proline Analogues
The ability of all obtained
compounds to interfere with the catalytic activity of P5C reductase,
purified from Arabidopsis thaliana cultured
cells,34 was then evaluated. In the range
from 10–4 to 10–3 M, their addition
to the assay mixture was found ineffective. On the contrary, when
millimolar concentrations of compounds (R)-, (S)-1, and(R)-6 were used, a significant inhibition was evident that was proportional
to the dose (Figure 2). Interestingly, their effectiveness was higher than that of proline,
which exerts product inhibition in the range from 10 to 200 mM.34,35 The calculated IC50 values were 84 ± 3, 24 ±
4, 21 ± 2, and 45 ± 19 mM for proline, (R)-, (S)-1, and (R)-6, respectively. However, these concentrations were 3–4
orders of magnitude higher than those found for bisphosphonate
inhibitors of P5C reductases from higher plants.4−7 Therefore, although potentially
useful for molecular-docking studies aimed at a better comprehension
of the product inhibition mechanism, the use of these analogues for
weed control seems unfeasible. The ability of phosphonic acid analogues
of proline and proline analogues to interfere with the activity of
the enzymes that catalyze the first step in proline biosynthesis in
bacteria and plants, namely γ-glutamyl kinase and P5C synthetase
from Escherichia coli and rice, respectively,
was also assessed. However, in no case was their catalytic rate significantly
inhibited (data not shown).

Figure 2 Effect of millimolar concentrations of compounds
(R)-, (S)-1, and (R)-6 on the activity of A. thaliana P5C reductase. The inhibition brought about by the physiological
product of the enzyme, proline, is also shown as a term of comparison.

Conclusions
In
summary, we have prepared the racemic 1-hydroxy-3-butenyl-,
3-chloro-1-hydroxypropyl-, and 3-bromo-1-hydroxypropylphosphonate
and converted them to chloroacetates for lipase-catalyzed enantioselective
hydrolysis. The racemates and (S)-enantiomers of
these α-hydroxyphosphonates were transformed into racemic and
(R)-configured pyrrolidin-2-yl-, oxazolidin-3-yl-,
oxazolidin-5-yl-, pyrazolidin-3-yl-, and 1,2-oxazinan-3-ylphosphonic
phosphonic acids by a variety of functional group manipulations. The
ee (92–99%) of the (R)-enantiomers were determined
after derivatization using chiral HPLC on quinine and quinidine-derived
anion-exchange columns. These phosphonic acids, structural analogues
of proline and proline analogues, were tested as P5C reductase inhibitors,
but displayed negligible activity. They also did not interfere with
the enzymes of bacteria and plants catalyzing the first step in proline
biosynthesis. These phosphonic acids may also be evaluated as inhibitors
of proline-metabolizing enzymes.

Experimental Section
General
Information
1H, 13C (J-modulated) and 31P NMR spectra were recorded
in CDCl3 or D2O on a Bruker AV 400 (1H: 400.13 MHz, 13C: 100.61 MHz, 31P: 161.98
MHz), AV III 400 (1H: 400.27 MHz, 13C: 100.65
MHz, 31P: 162.03 MHz), AV II+ 500 (1H: 500.32 MHz, 31P: 202.53 MHz), and AV III 600 (1H: 600.25 MHz, 13C: 150.93 MHz, 31P:
242.99 MHz) at 25 °C unless otherwise indicated. Chemical shifts
(δ) are reported in parts per million (ppm) relative to CHCl3/CDCl3 (δH 7.24; δC 77.00), toluene-d8 (δH 2.09 for HD2C of toluene-d7), HOD (δH 4.80) and external H3PO4 (85%; δP 0.00) and coupling constants (J) in Hz. Infrared (IR) spectra were recorded on a Bruker
VERTEX 70 IR spectrometer in the attenuated total reflection (ATR)
mode or of films on a silicon disc.36 High-resolution
mass spectra (HRMS) were obtained using a Brucker Maxis Q-TOF mass
spectrometer [electrospray ionization (ESI)]. Optical rotations were
measured on a PerkinElmer 341 polarimeter in a 1 dm quartz cell. Analytical
HPLC: Shimadzu system comprising components LC-20AT, SIL-20A HT, CTO-20AC,
SPD-20A, CMB-20A, column: CHIRALPAK IA (250 mm × 4.6 mm, particle
size 5 μm, 1 mL/min, 25 °C). Melting points were measured
on a Leica Galen III Thermovar instrument and are uncorrected.

Anhydrous THF was refluxed over potassium and distilled prior to
use. Pyridine was dried by refluxing over powdered CaH2, then distilled, and stored over molecular sieves (4 Å). All
other solvents, also dry ones, and chemicals were used as purchased.
Flash column chromatography was performed using silica gel (particle
size 0.040–0.063 mm). Reactions were monitored by analytical
TLC using precoated silica gel plates (60 F254, 250 μm
thickness). Spots were visualized by ultraviolet (UV) and/or dipping
into a solution of (NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O (25.0 g) and Ce(SO4)2·4H2O (1.0 g) in 10% aqueous H2SO4 (500 mL), followed by heating with a heat gun. The
solvent for TLC of phosphonic acids was iPrOH/H2O/NH3 (25%) in the ratio of 6:3:1. Spots of phosphonic
acids were visualized by dipping the silica gel plate into a solution
of 2% ninhydrin in EtOH and heating with a heat gun.

Determination
of Enantiomeric Excesses of Aminophosphonic Acids
The analytical
determination of enantiomeric excesses was performed
with a commercial CHIRALPAK tert-butyl-QD-AX (150
mm × 4 mm, 5 μm) column and an in-house prepared underivatized
OH-QN-AX column37 (150 mm × 4 mm,
5 μm; CSP1). The mobile phase comprised an aqueous H3PO4 solution in MeOH in the ratio of 1:9 (v/v). Note that
the molarity of the aqueous phase as well as the apparent pH (adjusted
with triethylamine) of the polar organic mobile phase and the flow
rates were optimized depending on the amino phosphonic acid, the column
type, and the derivatization type. These chromatographic conditions
are provided in the respective figure legends of the corresponding
chromatograms summarized in the Supporting Information.

The instrumentation used were a thermoshaker PHMT with PSC24N
from Grant-bio (Cambridgeshire, UK) and an Agilent 1100 HPLC–UV–fluorescence
detector (FLD) system from Agilent (Waldbronn, Germany), which comprised
a binary pump, a temperature controlled column oven, an autosampler,
a multiwavelength detector (MWD) and a FLD. For the FLD, a gain of
10, an excitation wavelength of 254 nm, and an emission wavelength
of 395 nm were chosen, whereas the MWD was set to 254 nm.

For
compounds 1 and 2, a derivatization
with the Sanger’s reagent (1-fluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene, DNFB
from Sigma Aldrich) and chiral separation on the CHIRALPAK tert-butyl-QD-AX column were chosen. For compounds 3, 4, and 6, a derivatization with
6-aminoquinolyl-N-hydroxysuccinimidyl carbamate (AQC
from Synchem) and chiral separation on an underivatized OH-QN-AX column
provided the best results.

AQC Derivatization
Phospha amino
acid (10 μL,
20 mM in water) was added to 0.2 M borate buffer (pH 8.8, 70 μL),
followed by the addition of AQC (3 mg/mL in dry acetonitrile, 20 μL).
The reaction mixture was immediately heated at 55 °C for 10 min.

DNFB Derivatization
To a solution (150 μL, 10
mM) of phospha amino acid in sodium carbonate buffer (0.1 M, pH 9.5),
Sanger reagent [2.5% (v/v) in acetonitrile, 50 μL] was added
and heated for 15 min at 50 °C. After reaching room temperature
and centrifugation, the respective mobile phase (350 μL) was
added.

Chromatographic results are summarized in the Supporting Information in Figure S1 [compounds
(R)-, (S)-, and (R,S)-1], Figure S2 [compounds (R)- and (R,S)-2], Figure S3 [compounds (R)- and (R,S)-3], Figure S4 [compound (R)-4], and Figure S5 [compounds (R)- and (R,S)-5].

Note that for DNFB-derivatized compounds 1 and 2, an elution order of the (S)-enantiomer
before the (R)-enantiomer was observed on the CHIRALPAK tert-butyl-QD-AX column with separation factors of 1.32
and 1.23, respectively. Concerning enantiomeric excess, an ee of 99.3%
was determined for compound (R)-1, 99.99%
for (S)-1, and 99.2% for (R)-2. The same elution order, (S)- before
(R)-enantiomer, was also observed for AQC-derivatized
compounds 3 and 4 using the unmodified QN-AX
column, providing separation factors of 1.14 and 1.38, respectively.
The determined ee values were 97.2% for compound (R)-3 and 98.8% for (R)-4 after crystallization (values for mother liquor and before crystallization:
76.9 and 92.2%). Although compound 6 was an analogue
of compound 2, an elution order of (R) before (S) was observed with a separation factor
of 1.23 and an ee value of 91.6% after crystallization (values for
mother liquor and before crystallization: 56.3 and 83.1%) using AQC
derivatization and separation on an unmodified QN-AX column. A control
experiment for compound 2 derivatized with AQC and separation
on the same unmodified QN-AX column showed the same elution order,
(R) before (S), as observed for
compound 6; however, no baseline separation could be
achieved under standard test conditions (data not shown). The deviation
in the elution order was the result of using different derivatization

(±)-3-Chloro-1-(chloroacetoxy)propylphosphonate
(±)-21 (5.463 g, 16.3 mmol) was dissolved in a mixture
of t-BuOMe and hexanes (36 mL, 1:1) and phosphate
buffer (25 mM, 120 mL).14 After the pH
had been adjusted to 7.0 using the autotitrator, lipase from Thermomyces lanuginosus (0.4 mL, ≥100 000
U/g, [3.1.1.3], Sigma) was added. The mixture was vigorously stirred
at room temperature, and pH of 7.0 was maintained by the addition
of NaOH (0.5 M). At a conversion of 40% by consumption of the base
(13.04 mL), the pH was brought to 4 by the addition of HCl (2 M).
The reaction mixture was extracted with EtOAc (3 × 100 mL). The
combined organic phases were washed with a saturated aq solution of
NaHCO3 (50 mL), dried (MgSO4), and concentrated
under reduced pressure. The residue was purified by flash chromatography

(±)-Diisopropyl 3-[(N,N′-Di-tert-butoxycarbonyl)hydrazino]-1-(methanesulfonyloxy)propylphosphonate
[(±)-29b]
Bis(Boc)-hydrazine31 (799 mg, 3.42 mmol, 1.5 equiv), Bu4NHSO4 (116 mg, 0.34 mmol, 0.15 equiv), toluene (10 mL),
and NaOH (4 mL, 20 w/v %) were added to mesyloxyphosphonate (±)-28b (870 mg, 2.28 mmol) at 0 °C. The mixture was stirred
vigorously. After 1 h, a sample for the 31P NMR spectrum
was withdrawn and diluted with CDCl3. As only the starting
product was detected, the cooling bath was replaced by a water bath
of 19 °C (the temperature was not allowed to surpass 20 °C).
After 2 h at 19–20 °C, another sample was withdrawn for 31P NMR spectroscopy. This time, beside the resonance for the
starting material (δP 15.3), a new signal (δP 16.1) appeared which was assigned to the hydrazine derivative
(±)-29b (their ratio was 1.0:0.54). Within 5 h at
19–20 °C, the starting material decreased to 1%. Now,
the reaction mixture was worked up. EtOAc (20 mL) and a saturated
aq solution of NaHCO3 (20 mL) were added. The organic phase
was removed, and the aq one was extracted with EtOAc (2 × 10
mL). The combined organic layers were washed with HCl (10 mL, 1 M),
dried (Na2SO4), and concentrated under reduced
pressure. The residue [(±)-25/(±)-29b/unknown compound/(±)-28b = 4:100:16:1, by 31P NMR] was purified by flash chromatography (heptanes/EtOAc,
1:1, Rf 0.15, starting material 0.22)
to give N,N′-bis(Boc)-hydrazinophosphonate
(±)-29b (911 mg, 75%) as a colorless gum.

Bu4NHSO4 (64 mg, 0.19 mmol, 0.15 equiv), toluene
(5 mL), and NaOH (2 mL, 20 w/v %) were added to 3-hydrazinophosphonate
(±)-29b (666 mg, 1.25 mmol). The mixture was heated
at 80 °C and stirred vigorously. After 3 h, the mixture was cooled
and diluted with EtOAc (20 mL) and water (8 mL). The organic phase
was separated, and the aq one was extracted with EtOAc (2 × 15

(±)-
and (R)-(−)-Diisopropyl 1,2-(Bis-tert-butoxycarbonyl)pyrazolidin-3-ylphosphonate
[(±)- and (R)-25] from 28c
Method A
(±)-3-Bromo-1-(4-nitrobenzenesulfonyloxy)propylphosphonate
(±)-28c (1.465 g, 3 mmol) was dissolved in toluene
(10 mL) under Ar. An aq solution of NaOH (6 mL, 20 w/v %), BocNH–NHBoc
(1.394 g, 6 mmol) and Bu4NHSO4 (290 mg, 0.9
mmol, dissolved in 5 mL of toluene) was added at room temperature.
The reaction mixture was vigorously stirred and heated at 50 °C
for 7 h. After cooling to room temperature, the reaction mixture was
diluted with EtOAc (10 mL) and neutralized with HCl (2 M). The organic
phase was separated, and the aq one was extracted with EtOAc (2 ×
20 mL). The combined organic layers were washed with brine, dried
(MgSO4), and concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue
was purified by flash chromatography (hexanes/EtOAc, 1:1, Rf 0.15) to yield pyrazolidin-3-ylphosphonate
(±)-25 (728 mg, 56%) as a yellowish gum.

Method
B
BocNH–NHBoc (1.237 g, 5 mmol, 2.5 equiv)
and KOtBu (561 mg, 5 mmol, 2.5 equiv) were dissolved
in dry DMF (5 mL) under Ar atmosphere. A solution of (±)-3-bromo-1-(4-nitrobenzenesulfonyloxy)propylphosphonate
(±)-28c (977 mg, 2 mmol) in dry DMF (5 mL) was added
at 0 °C. The reaction mixture was stirred for 1.5 h at 0 °C
and at room temperature until the starting material was virtually
consumed (1.5 h). Acetic acid (6 drops) was added, and the volatile
components were removed under reduced pressure (0.5 mbar). The residue
was taken up in H2O/EtOAc (30 mL, 1:1). The organic phase
was separated, and the aq one was extracted with EtOAc (2 × 10
mL). The combined organic phases were washed with brine, dried (MgSO4), and concentrated under reduced pressure. Flash chromatography
(hexanes/EtOAc, 3:2, Rf 0.23) of the residue
gave the desired racemic pyrazolidin-3-ylphosphonate (±)-25 (570 mg, 65%) as a yellowish oil.

Cyclization
by Method B with Alternative Work Up
(±)-Bromonosylate
(±)-28c (2.300 g, 4.71 mmol) was converted to protected
pyrazolidin-3-ylphosphonate (±)-25. When cyclization
was finished, the reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature,
and HCl (2 M, 25 mL) and water (25 mL) were added (color changed from
dark red/brown to yellow). The mixture was extracted with EtOAc (4
× 25 mL). The combined organic phases were washed with HCl (1
M, 2 × 20 mL), NaHCO3 (saturated aq solution, 10 mL),
dried (MgSO4), and concentrated under reduced pressure.
Flash chromatography of the residue gave the desired (±)-pyrazolidin-3-ylphosphonate
(±)-25 (1.250 g, 61%) as a yellowish oil.

(S)-(+)-Bromonosylate (S)-28c {1.464 g, 3 mmol; [α]D23 +19.7 (c 1.86, acetone);
ee 96% by chiral HPLC} was converted to protected (R)-(−)-pyrazolidin-3-ylphosphonate (R)-25 {635 mg, 49%; [α]D26 −25.5 (c 1.40, acetone)}
by method A. The spectroscopic data were identical to those of the
racemate.

(±)- and (R)-(+)-Pyrazolidin-3-ylphosphonic
Acid [(±)- and (R)-4]
AllylTMS (1.333 g, 1.85 mL, 11.67 mmol, 3 equiv) and TMSBr (5.955
g, 5.13 mL, 38.9 mmol, 10 equiv) were added to a solution of protected
(±)-pyrazolidin-3-ylphosphonate (±)-25 (1.700 g, 3.89 mmol) in dry DCE (20 mL) under Ar atmosphere.26 After stirring at 50 °C for 14 h and cooling
to room temperature, volatile components were removed under reduced
pressure (0.5 mbar). The residue was dissolved in DCE (10 mL), and
the solvent was again removed under reduced pressure (0.5 mbar). Water
(20 mL) was added to the residue, and the mixture was stirred for
10 min before it was extracted with EtOAc (2 × 15 mL). The aq
phase was concentrated (5 mL) and applied to a column filled with
Dowex 50W × 8, H+ (o. d. 1.5 × 14 cm, water as
eluent, fractions of 25 mL). Fractions containing the product (TLC: Rf 0.42) were pooled and concentrated under reduced
pressure to give (±)-pyrazolidinylphosphonic acid [(±)-4] (323 mg, 55%); mp 129–131 °C (H2O/EtOH). Similarly, protected (R)-(−)-pyrazolidin-3-ylphosphonate
(R)-25 {739 mg, 1.69 mmol; [α]D26 −25.5
(c 1.40, acetone)} was converted to (R)-(+)-pyrazolidin-3-ylphosphonic acid [(R)-4] {136 mg, 53%; [α]D18 +5.09 (c 0.51, H2O)} by the procedure used for the racemic compound; mp 118–119
°C (H2O/EtOH); ee 92.2% before crystallization, after
crystallization 98.8% ee (Figure S4). The
NMR data of (±)-and (R)-4 were
identical.

P5C Reductase Purification and Assay
A. thaliana P5C reductase was purified
from a suspension
of cultured cells, as previously described.34 Enzyme activity was measured at 35 °C as the P5C-dependent
oxidation of NADH. The assay mixture contained 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer,
pH 7.5, 0.4 mM NADH, 2 mM dl–P5C and 1 mM MgCl2 in a final volume of 1 mL. A limiting amount of enzyme (about
0.2 nkat) was added to the prewarmed mixture, and the decrease in
absorbance at 340 nm was determined for up to 10 min by continuous
monitoring of the sample. Activity was calculated on the assumption
of an extinction coefficient for NADH of 6220 M–1 cm–1. The concentrations causing 50% inhibition
(IC50) of P5C reductase activity and their confidence intervals
were estimated by nonlinear regression analysis using Prism 6 for
Windows (version 6.07; GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA, USA).
