A series of carbazole-based dyes
functionalized with different
auxochromes via vinyl linker have been synthesized and characterized.
A progressive shift in the absorption maximum is observed as the conjugation
and electron-donating nature of chromophore increases. Dyes containing
electron-releasing terminal groups such as triphenylamine and carbazole
exhibited positive emission solvatochromism attributable to an induced
intramolecular charge transfer from triphenylamine/carbazole donor
to cyano acceptor. The superior electroluminescence performance of
disubstituted dyes demonstrates the role of an additional cyanocarbazole
in achieving balanced charge transport compared to monosubstituted
analogues. In addition, the electroluminescence performance of the
dyes exhibited trends attributable to the electron richness of the
linker/terminal chromophore. Thus, the carbazole-based derivatives
displayed better electroluminescence efficiency than the analogous
fluorene derivatives. Similarly, 2,7-substituted carbazole derivative
exhibited better performance than the 3,6-substituted carbazole derivative.
A doped electroluminescent device containing 3 wt % tricarbazole derivative
showed blue emission with a high external quantum efficiency of 5.3%
at a practical brightness of 1000 cd/m2.

Introduction
Organic light-emitting
diodes (OLEDs) have evolved as a promising
alternative to the existing incandescent and liquid crystal displays
and light sources because they provide advantages such as cost-effectiveness,
low power consumption, wide range of color, and flexibility.1−4 For such practical applications, highly efficient and stable OLED
devices exhibiting primary color (red, green, and blue) emissions
are necessary. Particularly, highly efficient blue-emitting devices
are indispensable for the realization of power-saving full color displays
and white light sources.5−8 However, blue-emitting materials suffer from poor
device performance and detrimental efficiency roll-off arising from
intrinsic wide band gap and the subsequent ineffective charge injection/transportation.
In this context, organic emitters possessing wide band gap yet showing
balanced charge transport are necessary to achieve highly efficient
blue OLED.9−11 Generally, the electroluminescent characteristics
of the OLED devices are governed by the chromophoric units present
in the organic emitters. It is apparent that the judicious choice
of chromophores is mandatory to tune the optical and electroluminescent
properties of the organic materials.

Carbazole is a heterocyclic
aromatic hydrocarbon demonstrated as
a potential building block for OLED materials owing to its extended
π-conjugation, excellent quantum yield, good charge-transporting
ability, and high thermal and morphological stabilities. Further,
the facile functionalization at various nuclear positions of carbazole
opens up multiple pathways to modulate the functional properties by
the choice of chromophores.12−14 In addition, carbazole-based
materials are exploited as host materials for triplet emitters and
thermally activated delayed fluorescence emitters owing to their high
triplet energy and small difference between singlet and triplet energy
levels, respectively.15−18 Since the functional properties of the organic dyes are dependent
on their chemical structure, the establishment of structure–property
relationship of the molecules would shed light on the rational development
of organic emitters.19

Direct C–C
coupling of organic chromophores generally results
in ineffective electronic conjugation because of the twisting between
the adjacent segments. However, the deployment of π-spacers
between the chromophoric segments would ensure extended conjugation
across the molecule. Vinyl linker is one of the spacers often used
in organic dyes to improve π-electronic conjugation. Generally,
the planarity of vinyl dyes leads to detrimental π–π
stacking in solid state. On the other hand, certain amount of stacking
is necessary to increase the charge carrier transport through hopping
mechanism.20,21 Carbazole derivatives containing
vinyl linker at C3- and N9-positions are known for their hole-transporting
character, which is comparable to that of the widely used hole transporter, N,N′-bis(naphthalen-1-yl)-N,N′-bis(phenyl)benzidine.22,23 Carbazole, tethered naphthalene via vinyl linker, showed green emission
with good quantum yield, yet the device performance was not up to
the mark due to the imbalanced charge transport.24,25 Further, carbazole and anthracene conjugates possessing vinyl spacer
are demonstrated as aggregation-induced emitters.26 Lu and co-workers reported asymmetrically functionalized
carbazoles at C3- and C6-positions with triphenylamine/pyrene and
utilized them as hole-transporting green emitters.27 Generally, the functionalization of carbazole at C3- and
C6-positions prevents close packing arrangement and thus improves
its amorphous nature.28,29 Park and co-workers reported
emitters containing carbazole and fluorene linked via vinyl unit,
but their electroluminescence (EL) performance is unsatisfactory due
to imbalanced charge injection/transport.30 Furthermore, Leclerc and co-workers reported linear carbazole trimers
connected through vinyl linker and exploited them as charge-transporting
materials in OFET.31,32 They found that the coplanarity
of the molecules is beneficial for close-packed arrangements in molecular
level as well as to extend the π–π stacking in
thin film, which favors hole mobility across the molecular layer in
device.

Recently, bipolar emitters have received attention for
the realization
of high-performance OLED because they provide balanced transport of
charge carriers. Generally, bipolar emitters possess donor–acceptor
(D–A) configuration, which would in turn red-shift the emission
spectrum.33−36 For example, Ledwon and co-workers reported carbazole–benzothiadiazole
conjugate containing vinyl spacer as fluorescent emitter.36 They concluded that the donor–acceptor
interaction between carbazole donor and benzothiadiazole acceptor
resulted in low band gap and thus red emission. Therefore, the design
of bipolar materials, which do not show D–A interaction, would
be an ideal method for the fabrication of highly efficient blue-emitting
devices.37,38 Cyano-substituted carbazole derivatives
are known as bipolar emitters as well as host for triplet emitters.39−43 It is felt that the rational design of 2-cyanocarbazole derivatives
would inhibit D–A interaction while imparting balanced charge
transport. Vinyl linkage may be beneficial to extend the conjugation.
We intend to study the effect of different aromatic segments on the
photophysical and electroluminescent properties. In this report, we
present a series of compounds containing 2-cyanocarbazole tethered
to chromophores via vinyl linker. All of the compounds exhibited blue
emission in solution with high quantum yields. Interestingly, the
dyes containing fluorene and carbazole displayed efficiency roll-up
at high operating voltage. Further, the electroluminescent performances
of carbazole-based dyes are superior to those of fluorene analogues
due to the enhanced charge-transfer quotient.

Results and Discussion
Synthesis
and Characterization
The synthetic route
for the target dyes is illustrated in Scheme 1. The Heck reaction of 7-bromo-9-(2-ethylhexyl)-9H-carbazole-2-carbonitrile44 (1) with suitable mono- and di-terminal alkenes led to 3a–c and 6a–c, respectively, in moderate to good yields. The divinyl precursor,
9,9-diethyl-2,7-divinyl-9H-fluorene (5a), was synthesized from 9,9-diethyl-9H-fluorene-2,7-dicarbaldehyde45 (4) by following the Wittig reaction.
The other alkenes required were synthesized by following the literature
procedures.46,47 All of the new compounds were
characterized by 1H NMR, 13C NMR, and high-resolution
mass spectral data. The proposed structures of the compounds are consistent
with the analytical data. All of the dyes are soluble in common organic
solvents such as toluene (TOL), dichloromethane (DCM), chloroform
(CHCl3), tetrahydrofuran (THF), and N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) and sparingly soluble in acetonitrile
and methanol (MeOH).

Scheme 1 Synthetic Method for the Target Dyes (3a–e and 6a–c)
Photophysical Properties
The absorption spectra of
the dyes recorded in dichloromethane are displayed in Figure 1a, and the relevant data are
summarized in Table 1. There are two distinct bands with shoulders in the absorption spectra
of the compounds. The higher-energy band below ca. 300 nm corresponds
to a localized π–π* transition of carbazole moiety.48 The lower-energy absorption band above 300 nm
can be assigned to the delocalized π–π* transition
of the entire molecule. The dyes may be classified into two categories:
(i) asymmetrically substituted (3a–e) carbazoles and (ii) symmetrically disubstituted (6a–c) compounds. In the former set, the absorption
profile is highly dependent on the nature of electron-rich chromophore
tethered on cyanocarbazole. The latter set dyes exhibited red-shifted
absorption maxima and higher molar extinction coefficient compared
to their analogous monosubstituted derivatives (for example, compare 3a with 6a). It is ascribed to the extended π-conjugation
due to the presence of an additional cyanocarbazole unit. The absorption
spectrum of 3d is bathochromically (47 nm) shifted compared
to 3a, which indicates the crucial role of triphenylamine
due to its electron-donating nature. In addition, 2,7-substituted
linear carbazole derivative 6c displayed red-shifted
absorption compared to the 3,6-substituted counterpart 6b. It is ascribed to the elongation of conjugation along the linear
axis of carbazole.49 The red-shifted absorption
of 3c compared to the literature compounds (E)-1,2-bis(9-ethyl-9H-carbazol-3-yl)ethene and (E)-1,2-bis(9-ethyl-9H-carbazol-2-yl)ethene,50 which lack cyano group, shows the effect of
cyano group. Similarly, the dye 6a showed red-shifted
absorption maxima compared to the known compound 3,3′-((1E,1′E)-(9,9-bis(4-(octyloxy)phenyl)-9H-fluorene-2,7-diyl)bis(ethene-2,1-diyl))bis(9-ethyl-9H-carbazole).30

It is also interesting
to compare the absorption maximum of 6c with the literature
compound 2,2′-((1E,1′E)-(9-hexyl-9H-carbazole-2,7-diyl)bis(ethene-2,1-diyl))bis(9-hexyl-9H-carbazole),31 which lack cyano
group at peripheral carbazole, and another known compound 7,7′-((1E,1′E)-(9-methyl-9H-carbazole-2,7-diyl)bis(ethene-2,1-diyl))bis(2-hexyl-9-methyl-9H-carbazole),31 which possess
hexyl chain instead of cyano group. The dye 6c showed
red-shifted absorption of about 5–7 nm. The above comparisons
clearly demonstrate the auxochromic role of the cyano group. All of
the dyes showed solvent-independent absorption profiles, which suggest
the absence of significant solute–solvent interactions in the
ground state.

The emission spectra of the dyes recorded in dichloromethane
are
displayed in Figure 1b, and the data are presented in Table 1. All of the dyes showed structured emission,
whereas triphenylamine (3d) and carbazole (functionalized
at C3- and C3/C6-positions) derivatives (3c and 6b) showed broad and featureless emission spectra. The structured
emission of the dyes (3a, 3b, 3e, 6a, and 6c) indicates the rigidity of
the molecules in their excited states. The broad emission of the dyes 3c, 3d, and 6b points to the structural
perturbation of the molecules in the excited state. Triphenylamine-substituted
dye exhibited the longest wavelength emission maximum among the dyes.
It could be attributed to the pronounced structural reorganization
and dipolar relaxation in the excited state.51 The dyes possessing structured emission (3a, 3b, 3e, 6a, and 6c)
exhibited similar emission maxima in all of the solvents of different
polarities. This indicates the nonpolar nature of their excited states.
In contrast, carbazole and triphenylamine derivatives 3c, 3d, and 6b displayed a progressive red
shift in the emission as the polarity of the solvent is increased.
It might be due to the dipolar relaxation of excited state in polar
solvents.51 It is further attested by the
dramatic increase of Stokes shift in polar solvents (Figure 2). In addition, the full width
at half-maximum (FWHM) also increased, which supports the preferential
stabilization of excited state in polar solvents.

Figure 2 Lippert–Mataga
plot for the dyes 3c, 3d, and 6b.

The nature of excited state can
be understood by inspecting Lippert–Mataga
plots. The linear relationship (Figure 2) obtained for the dyes 3c, 3d, and 6b suggests the presence of single excited state,
namely, charge-transfer state.52 Emission
spectra of the drop-cast thin films of the dyes displayed broad and
red-shifted emission compared to their corresponding photoluminescence
(PL) spectra recorded in toluene (Figure S9). It might be due to the intermolecular interaction and the formation
of J-aggregation of the dyes in the solid state.53 This is further supported by the reduction in
fluorescence quantum yield in the film state.

Electrochemical Properties
The electrochemical properties
of the dyes were studied by cyclic voltammetry measurements. All of
the dyes displayed irreversible oxidation (Figure S10), which could be ascribed to the large reorganization energy
associated with the oxidation of rigid molecular framework.54 The oxidation propensity is proportional to
the electron-donating capability of the chromophore attached on cyanocarbazole
core. The lowest oxidation potential of 3d among the
dyes is ascribed to the relatively strong electron-donating nature
of the triphenylamine unit (Table 2). Consequently, triphenylamine derivative 3d possessed relatively high-lying highest occupied molecular orbital
(HOMO) energy level in the series, which would be beneficial for facile
hole injection from the adjacent layer in the OLED. The disubstituted
dyes (6a and 6b) possessed high-lying HOMO
and low-lying lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) compared
to their analogous monosubstituted dyes (3a and 3b). It could be ascribed to the presence of additional electron-donating
carbazole and electron-withdrawing cyano group, respectively. The
observed energy levels are well matching with the neighboring molecular
layers of device, which would be beneficial for facile charge injection.

Thermal Properties
The thermal robustness of the dyes
was studied by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) under nitrogen atmosphere
at a heating rate of 10 °C/min. The thermograms of the dyes are
presented in Figure 3, and the relevant data are compiled in Table 2. In general, all of the compounds exhibited
a two-step degradation except 3a. All of the compounds
showed high onset temperature corresponding to 10% weight loss in
the range 332–411 °C. The high onset temperature of 3d (411 °C) stems from the nonplanar nature of triphenylamine
moiety.55 In general, disubstituted compounds
exhibited high thermal stability over monosubstituted dyes due to
the presence of additional carbazole moiety. The improved stability
of 6c is ascribed to the presence of three rigid carbazoles.
This further supports the role of carbazole in enhancing the high
thermal stability of molecular materials. The beneficial role of carbazole
in thermal stability is well demonstrated in the literature.56−58 The glass-forming ability of the dyes was examined by differential
scanning calorimetry. All of the compounds showed melting behavior
without glass-transition signal.

Theoretical Investigations
To understand
the electronic
properties of the dyes, density functional theory (DFT) calculations
were carried out. The geometries of the models in which the alkyl
chains are approximated to methyl group were optimized using B3LYP/6-31G(d,p)
within Gaussian framework.59,60 The computed absorption
maxima, oscillator strength, and the most prominent electronic transitions
of the dyes are summarized in Table S4.
The trend of longer-wavelength absorption maximum of the dyes matches
well with that of experimental data. The oscillator strength of the
dyes predicted for the HOMO-to-LUMO electronic excitation matched
well with the experimental molar extinction coefficients. The frontier
molecular orbital diagrams of the dyes are presented in Figures 4 and S11.

Figure 4 Frontier molecular orbital diagrams of the dyes (3d, 6b, and 6c) in theoretical models and
their percentage contribution to excitation.

The HOMO and LUMO of 3a, 3b, 3e, 6a, and 6c are diffused over
the entire
molecule. It indicates that the prominent electronic excitation is
typical π–π* transition. On the contrary, for the
dyes 3c, 3d, and 6b, the HOMO
is localized on carbazole, triphenylamine, and central carbazole,
respectively, and slightly diffused up to peripheral cyanocarbazole,
whereas the LUMO is mainly concentrated on the cyanocarbazole unit.
This clearly identifies the charge migration from donor carbazole/triphenylamine
to cyanocarbazole acceptor during the electronic excitation.61

Electroluminescence Properties
The
electroluminescent
properties of the dyes were examined by employing them as emitter.
The configuration of OLED devices is ITO/PEDOT:PSS/CBP/dopant (3a–e and 6a–c)/TBPi/LiF/Al, where ITO (indium-doped tin oxide) serves
as anode, PEDOT:PSS (poly(ethylenedioxythiophene)/poly(styrenesulfonate))
serves as hole-injecting layer, CBP (N,N′-dicarbazolyl-4,4′-biphenyl) serves as host material
into which dyes are doped, TBPi (1,3,5-tris(N-phenylbenzimidazol-2-yl)benzene)
and LiF serve as electron-transporting and electron-injecting layers,
respectively, and Al serves as cathode. Since the dyes 3d and 3e possessed low-energy barrier for hole injection,
we fabricated nondoped devices by utilizing them as emitters. The
nondoped devices exhibited high current density but low luminance
(Figures 5 and S12). The high current density might be due to
the charge carrier leakage at interface/electrode. Further, the electroluminescence
spectrum of nondoped device red-shifted compared to the photoluminescence
spectrum recorded in toluene. It clearly indicates the formation of
aggregates in solid state, which in turn would induce crystallization
and thus low luminance.62,63

Figure 5 (a) Current density–voltage–luminance
(J–V–L) and (b) comparison
of EL and PL spectra for the dyes 3e, 6a, and 6c.

To avoid the aggregation-induced fluorescence quenching,
we have
fabricated the doped device in which CBP served as host. The current
density–voltage–luminance (J–V–L) plots of the devices are displayed
in Figures 5 and S12, and the corresponding electroluminescent
data are listed in Table 3. The electroluminescence spectrum of the doped device is
restored to narrow and blue-shifted photoluminescence spectrum recorded
in toluene. It suggests the alleviation of aggregation by the dispersion
of emitting molecules in CBP host.64 The
absence of residual emission of CBP host in the electroluminescence
spectrum suggests the near-unity energy transfer from host to the
dopant. Consequently, luminance is enhanced in doped devices.

high turn-on voltages for the dyes 3d and 6b are reminiscent of their high energy barrier
for the injection of charge carriers (Table 3 and Figure 6). The lowest turn-on voltage is observed for the dye 6a, which could be attributed to the facile injection of charge
carriers due to low charge injection barriers.65−67 The high current
efficiency and power efficiency of 3d and 3e could be attributed to the charge-transporting capabilities of functional
chromophores such as triphenylamine and pyrene and their favorable
energy level for the charge injection.67 The high performance of 3e among monosubstituted dyes
could be attributed to high quantum yield and small energy barrier
for charge injection/transport from the adjacent layers.

In general, the disubstituted dyes exhibited enhanced electroluminescence
performance compared to analogous monosubstituted dyes. It suggests
the role of additional cyanocarbazole in achieving balanced charge
transport and effective harvest of excitons in emissive layers. The
current and power efficiency is almost 2-fold increased for linear
carbazole dye 6c compared to the fluorene derivative 6a. It is corroborated with the charge-transporting capability
of carbazole over fluorene. The best electroluminescence is observed
for the device fabricated with 6c (3 wt %) with a power
efficiency of 6.2 lm/W, a current efficiency of 8.5 cd/A, an external
quantum efficiency (EQE) of 4.6%, and a maximum brightness of 9314
cd/m2. It could be attributed to high quantum yield and
two cyanocarbazole units to realize balanced charge transport. Interestingly,
the efficiency roll-up is observed for fluorene and carbazole derivatives
at a high luminance of 1000 cd/m2. At low voltage, only
guest molecules harvest excitons, whereas both host and guest harvest
excitons at high voltage. As a result, unusual efficiency roll-up
has taken place.68−71 Particularly, the harvesting of excitons from both host and guest
leads to a theoretically exceeding EQE of 5.3% at 1000 cd/m2 for the device fabricated with 6c. Interestingly, the
emission color of the devices ranged from deep blue to cyan (Figure 7). This shows the
tuning of the emission color by chromophore modification in the structural
design.

Conclusions
A
series of 2-cyanocarbazole derivatives functionalized with different
chromophores via vinyl linker have been synthesized by palladium-catalyzed
Heck coupling reaction. The effect of cyano group and vinyl linker
on optical and electroluminescence properties is demonstrated. The
absorption and emission properties are highly dependent on the nature
of appended chromophores on the cyanocarbazole scaffold. The positive
emission solvatochromism observed for triphenylamine and carbazole
(functionalized at C3- and C3/C6-positions) derivatives is due to
the dipolar relaxation at excited state. Disubstituted dyes exhibited
better electroluminescence performance over monosubstituted analogues,
which could be attributed to the presence of additional cyanocarbazole
to realize balanced charge transport. The electroluminescent device
fabricated with 6c (3 wt %) exhibited best performance
of power efficiency (6.2 lm/W), current efficiency (8.5 cd/A), and
EQE (4.6%).
