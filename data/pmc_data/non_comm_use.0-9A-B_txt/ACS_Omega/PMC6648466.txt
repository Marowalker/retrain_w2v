Superconductivity in bulk rhombohedral
Bi has recently been detected to appear below 0.53 mK and 5.2 μT.
Here, we unambiguously demonstrate that superconductivity in rhombohedral
Bi can be greatly enhanced by incorporating Ni ions onto the Bi sites
and reducing the size to the nanometer scale. The superconducting
transition temperature TC of 12 nm rhombohedral
Bi nanoparticles (NPs) reaches 4 K at ambient pressure. TC is significantly enhanced to reach 7, 12, and 18 K in
6, 8, and 10% Ni-doped Bi NPs, respectively, where superconductivity
is found to coexist with ferromagnetism. Ni-doping causes a significant
amount of electronic charges to shift toward the interconnecting regions
between neighboring Bi ions. First-principles calculations reveal
that the Ni ions serve as charge and spin suppliers for the developments
of superconductivity and ferromagnetism.

1 Introduction
At ambient pressure,
the pentavalent semimetal Bi ([Xe]4f155d106s26p3) crystallizes into a rhombohedral structure
with a spatial symmetry belonging to the space group R3̅m. This crystalline structure gives rise
to a Fermi surface that consists of ellipsoidal-shaped pockets, with
a small Fermi surface area, hence a small density of states (DOS),
and a low carrier density.1 An extremely
low transition temperature for the superconductivity (SC) in rhombohedral
Bi is hence expected. The search for SC in pure Bi has continued for
decades, but experimental difficulties have been encountered because
of the extremely low superconducting transition temperature TC and critical magnetic field HC.2−5 SC in bulk rhombohedral Bi at ambient pressure
has recently been detected to appear below TC = 0.53 mK and HC = 5.2 μT.6 This TC detected
in a Bi single crystal at ambient pressure is 2.45 times lower than
the 1.3 mK estimated5 according to the
BCS formalism. Apparently, the SC in rhombohedral Bi cannot be fully
understood by the BCS theory alone. It has also been found that the TC of Bi is largely enhanced when it crystallizes
into a structure of higher crystalline symmetry. Three structural
phases of Bi have been identified upon pressurizing up to 19 GPa.
The rhombohedral phase that appears at the ambient pressure evolves
into a monoclinic one at 2.55 GPa with a TC of 3.9 K, followed by a tetragonal one at 2.7 GPa with a TC of 7 K, and finally a body-centered cubic
one at 8.1 GPa with a TC of 8.1 K.7−14 In addition, face-centered
cubic (fcc) Bi can be grown on a thin Ni seed layer,15,16 in which SC and ferromagnetism (FM) are found to coexist below a TC of 4.2 K.16 SC
has also been found in intermetallic compounds of Bi with magnetic
atoms. Orthorhombic Bi3Co17 and
tetragonal Bi2Fe18 become superconducting
below 0.48 and 1.3 K (at 40 GPa), respectively. A type-II SC has been
detected in orthorhombic Bi3Ni below 4.1 K.19−21 These enhancements of TC for Bi originate from the changes in the electronic
band structures when the crystalline symmetry is altered. Similar
to what has been observed in other compounds, the TC of Bi in the form of reduced dimensions can be significantly
higher than that in its bulk form.4,22−26 The highest TC found thus far in rhombohedral Bi can reach 8.3 K and
appears in granular Bi nanowires with rhombohedral grains that are
10 nm in diameter.22,23 It has also been demonstrated
that the TC of In and Sn nanoparticles
(NPs) can be significantly enhanced by the introduction of Ni NPs
into the vicinity of the superconducting NPs.27−29

The goal of this study is to search
for a doping component that enhances the SC in rhombohedral Bi. A
small amount of doping component in the compound is a prerequisite
for not altering the crystalline structure of the Bi. Partial replacement
of Bi by Ni is a selection among others. The 8 d-electrons of Ni ([Ar]3d84s2) can give rise to an enriched electron density
together with an enlarged DOS near the Fermi level. The smaller ionic
radius of Ni places less atomic strength in altering the crystalline
structure of the host rhombohedral Bi lattice. The magnetic character
of Ni may guide the magnetic flux to condense more near the Ni sites.
In this report, we demonstrate that the TC and HC of rhombohedral Bi NPs can be
greatly enhanced by the incorporation of Ni ions onto the NPs, and
that SC coexists with FM. The TC of 12
nm rhombohedral Bi NPs reaches 4 K at ambient pressure. Surprisingly,
a more than fourfold increase of TC to
18 K is found after the incorporation of 10% Ni into 11 nm Bi NPs.
The isothermal magnetization M(Ha) reveals a Langevin field profile and magnetic hysteresis
is clearly revealed in the superconducting phase, showing the coexistence
of SC and FM. Interestingly, the electronic charge distribution of
the Bi0.9Ni0.1 NPs is quite different from that
of the Bi NPs. The electronic charges in Bi0.9Ni0.1 have a more extended distribution, with a significant amount of
electronic charges shift toward the interconnecting regions of the
neighboring Bi ions. First-principles calculations show that the DOS,
the carrier density, and the spin density near the Fermi surface increase
significantly upon Ni-doping.

2 Sample Fabrication
Three sets of Ni-doped Bi NPs together
with one set of Ni-free Bi NPs were fabricated employing the gas-condensation
method, using a chamber equipped with two decoupled evaporation sources
for separate evaporation of Bi or Ni. High-purity Bi spheres (∼0.3
g each, 99.999% pure and ∼2 mm in diameter) and Ni spheres
(∼0.05 g each, 99.999% pure and ∼1 mm in diameter) were
heated separately using current sources and were evaporated at a rate
of 0.05 Å/s in an Ar atmosphere. The chemical composition of
Ni in the resultant NPs was controlled by the selection of the heating
current in the Ni electrode. The fabrication parameters are listed
in Table 1. A nonmagnetic
SS316 stainless steel plate placed 20 cm above the evaporation source
and maintained at 77 K was used to collect the evaporated particles.
After restoration to room temperature, the NPs were stripped off.
The samples thus obtained were in powdered form and consisted of a
macroscopic amount of individual NPs. There was no substrate or capping
molecules on the NPs. The resultant powders were no longer silvery
but dark black, indicating that the absorption bands of the powders
had blue-shifted to the invisible region, as is the case for most
metallic NPs. The sample consists of Bi and Ni ions with an atom ratio
of Bi/Ni = m/n is hereafter designated
as BimNin.

3 Sample Characterization
X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM),
and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were used to characterize
the samples. The XRD measurements for structural investigation were
performed on a Bruker D8 ADVANCE diffractometer, employing the standard
reflection geometry. The high-resolution transmission electron microscopy
(HRTEM) images were taken using a JEOL JEM-2100, employing an acceleration
voltage of 200 kV for a magnification of 3 × 105 times.
The XPS spectra were taken on a Thermo Scientific K-Alpha+ XPS system, employing the standard setup with an Al Kα microfocused
monochromator and a spot size of 400 μm.

The XRD patterns
reveal the same rhombohedral crystalline structure for the four sets
of NPs, with the diffraction peaks of the Ni-doped NPs appearing at
higher scattering angles (Figure 1a). The lattice constants of the Ni-doped Bi NPs are
noticeably smaller than that of the Bi NPs, reflecting the smaller
ionic size of Ni than that of Bi. No diffraction signals from the
crystallized Bi3Ni or Ni can be identified in the diffraction
patterns (Figure 1a).
Weak but visible diffraction intensities from incomplete cancellations
of the rhombohedral (111) + (12̅1), (112), (201), and (114)
+ (12̅4) reflections appear in the diffraction patterns of the
BimNin NPs
(Figure 1b), showing
that the ions on the lattice sites are not all the same in these samples.
This reflects the appearance of Ni ions on the lattice sites. XPS
was used to demonstrate the existence of Ni ions in the compounds
and determine the relative compositions between Bi and Ni in the compounds.
The XPS spectra of BimNin NPs reveal binding energies of 855.5 and 874 eV for the Ni
2p3/2 and 2p1/2 lines, respectively (Figure 2a). No Ni lines may
be identified in the XPS spectra of the Bi NPs (Figure 2b). The binding energies for the Ni in BimNin NPs are considerably
higher than the binding energy of 852.8 and 870.2 eV obtained for
the fcc Ni, revealing much stronger bonding of the Ni ions in BimNin NPs to their
neighboring ions than those in the pure fcc Ni. The spectral lines
from the Bi ions are also revealed in the XPS spectra of the BimNin NPs. The
relative intensities of the Bi and Ni lines are used to determine
the Ni compositions in the BimNin NPs, giving rise to Ni compositions of 6, 8, and
10% for the three sets of BimNin NPs.

same rhombohedral crystalline symmetry for both NP assemblies, with
a smaller unit cell for the Bi0.9Ni0.1 NPs.
No crystalized Ni peak can be identified. (b) XRD pattern of the Bi0.9Ni0.1 NP assembly plotted using an enlarged y-axis scale for clarity of presentation of weak reflections.

the characteristic Ni-2p1/2 and Ni-2p3/2 lines.
The stars indicate the associated satellite lines. (b) Portion of
the XPS spectrum of the Bi NPs, where no Ni binding lines may be identified.
The arrows indicate the expected positions of the Ni lines.

The diffraction peak profile from a size-dispersed
particle assembly was used to extract the size distribution by combining
the expected diffraction profiles contributed from each individual
particle in the powder.30 The size distribution
and mean particle diameter of the NP assemblies were determined by
fitting the diffraction peaks to the diffraction profiles of finite
sized particles, assuming log-normal size distributions for the assemblies.
The curves in Figure 3a indicate the fitted patterns for the Bi0.9Ni0.1 (solid curve) and Bi (dashed curve) NP assemblies, with the size
distributions shown in Figure 3b, revealing mean particle diameters of 11(1) and 12(1) nm
for the Bi0.9Ni0.1 and Bi NP assemblies, respectively.
The mean particle diameters thus determined for the Bi, Bi0.94Ni0.06, Bi0.92Ni0.08, and Bi0.9Ni0.1 NP assemblies are 12(1), 12(2), 11(2),
and 11(1) nm, respectively. The strains accumulated in the NPs were
investigated by a Scherrer plot, showing there is no significant stress
in the NP assemblies. The average strain obtained from the XRD profiles
was 3.2 × 10–4 for the Bi0.9Ni0.1 NPs and 4.4 × 10–4 for the Bi NPs.
HRTEM images of the Bi0.9Ni0.1 NPs reveal the
stacking of the wavy a–b layers along the c-axis direction to form Bi ellipses (Figure 3c,d). The layers revealed in the images correspond
to the Bi(003) lattice planes because there are three wavy a–b
layers in a unit cell. There are no identifiable traces of oxidation
phases or core–shell structures in the TEM images but revealing
elliptically shaped bare Bi particles, which is a direct result of
an insufficient number of Ni atoms being provided during fabrication.

curves) XRD patterns of the Bi0.9Ni0.1 and Bi
NP assemblies. (b) Size distributions for the Bi0.9Ni0.1 and Bi NP assemblies obtained from the XRD profiles. (c,d)

sizes of ∼10 × 8 nm2 (left image) and ∼13
× 9 nm2 (right image) are clearly revealed.

4 Superconductivity
The electric resistivity, magnetization, and ac magnetic susceptibility
measurements were performed on a Physical Property Measurement System
(PPMS), manufactured by Quantum Design, employing the standard setups.
For magnetization and ac magnetic susceptibility measurements, ∼60
mg of the powdered sample was loosely packed into a thin nonmagnetic
cylindrical holder. Prior to loading, the sample was shaken at 50
Hz for 5 min using a Vortex-Genie mixer to avoid aggregation among
the NPs. The mass density of the powdered sample packed in holder
was ∼5% of the bulk density, which indicates the ratio of the
mass densities of the assembly to that of its bulk counterpart. This
mass density for the NP assembly corresponds to an average interparticle
separation from edge to edge of 1.1 times the particle diameter, thus
the interparticle interaction would be insignificant. The holder,
manufactured by Quantum Design, produced a smooth temperature curve
with a background signal that was ∼2% the strength of the signal
from the sample. The electric resistivity was measured on a solid
piece sample of size ∼4 × 3 × 0.7 mm3,
employing the standard four-probe setup operated in the constant current
mode of I = 0.1 mA. The sample was obtained by cold-pressing
the Bi0.9Ni0.1 NP powder flat using a mechanical
pressure of 25 kg W/mm2. The resultant sample was in the
form of a solid piece, with a packing fraction that was 60% of the
bulk density. At this point, the average separation from edge to edge
between two neighboring particles is ∼0.8 nm, which acts as
resistive potential barriers for electrical conduction.

A drop
to nearly zero resistance on cooling through 18 K is clearly revealed
in the temperature dependence of electric resistance of the 11 nm
Bi0.9Ni0.1 NP assembly, showing the transition
to the superconducting state below TC =
18 K (Figure 4a). The
resistivity of this Bi0.9Ni0.1 NP compact is
comparable to that observed in Bi single-crystal films.31 The small residual resistivity (∼20 μΩ
cm) seen at low temperatures reflects the tunneling barriers in the
NP assembly. This tunneling resistivity reflects mainly the work function
for the electrons to leave the surface of an NP and entering the neighboring
one because the average separation between two neighboring NPs is
only 0.8 nm with which many NPs can be indeed in contact. Diamagnetic
screenings that reveal a TC = 4 K for
the development of SC in the 12 nm Bi NPs are seen in the temperature
dependence of magnetization (filled triangles in Figure 4b). Interestingly, the TC of the 11 nm Bi0.9Ni0.1 NPs reaches 18 K (open circles in Figure 4b). The M(T) curve of the 11 nm Bi0.9Ni0.1 NPs may be
described by Scalapino’s expression32 (solid curve on data) for superconducting diamagnetic screening.
Surprisingly, the incorporation of 10% Ni ions into the Bi NPs causes
the superconducting TC to increase by
4.5 times. Meissner screening of the 11 nm Bi0.9Ni0.1 NP assembly is clearly revealed in the M(T) curve measured during zero-field cooling from
300 to 2 K (filled triangles in Figure 4c) followed by warming to 35 K after the application
of a magnetic field Ha of 50 Oe (open
circles in Figure 4c). Magnetizations of the 11 nm Bi0.9Ni0.1 NPs
remain zero within the noise level during zero-field cooling; diamagnetic
responses appear with the application of a weak Ha of 50 Oe. The TC of the
BimNin NPs
increases with an increase in the Ni composition x (Figure 4d). An attempt
to fabricate rhombohedral BimNin NPs with a higher Ni composition was not successful,
producing instead orthorhombic Bi3Ni NPs with a TC of 4 K.

Figure 4 (a) Temperature
dependence of the electric resistivity of the 11 nm Bi0.9Ni0.1 NP assembly, measured in a constant current mode
with I = 0.1 mA. A drop in resistivity on cooling
below 18 K is clearly seen, revealing a transition into the superconducting
state. (b) Thermal variation of the magnetization of the Bi (filled
triangles) and Bi0.9Ni0.1 (open circles) NP
assemblies, measured during warming process with Ha = 50 Oe after zero-field cooling to 2 K. The scales
on the vertical axis on the right hand size of the plot indicate the
volume magnetization of the Bi0.9Ni0.1 NPs.
A factor of 1.06 times higher for the scales is needed to indicate
the volume magnetization of the Bi NPs. Diamagnetic signals that reflect
the development of SC are clearly revealed below 4 and 18 K for the
Bi and Bi0.9Ni0.1 NP assemblies, respectively.
The solid line on the data points of the Bi0.9Ni0.1 NP assembly indicates the results of the fit to Scalapino’s
expression. (c) Temperature dependence of the magnetizations of the
Bi0.9Ni0.1 NP assembly, measured during zero-field
cooling from 300 to 2 K (filled triangles), followed by warming to
35 K after the application of a magnetic field of 50 Oe at 2 K (open
circles). (d) Variations of TC with the
Ni composition x in Bi1–xNix NP assemblies, obtained from
magnetization data.

The application of a magnetic
field Ha suppresses the superconducting
transition temperature TC to a lower temperature
for both the Bi and Bi0.9Ni0.1 NP assemblies. Figure 5a show the isofield M(T) taken at four representative Ha, where the solid lines indicate the results
of fits to the Scalapino’s expression that allow the extractions
of TC. The variations of TC with Ha can be described
by TC(Ha)
= TC0[1 – (Ha/HC0)α], with TC0 = 4.23(1) K, HC0 = 3.02(3) kOe, and α = 0.62(1) for the Bi NPs (solid curve
in Figure 5b) and TC0 = 19(2) K, HC0 = 3.7(6) kOe, and α = 0.45(9) for the Bi0.9Ni0.1 NPs (solid curve in Figure 5c). Note that TC0 is the TC at Ha = 0, HC0 represents the critical magnetic field at T = 0, and exponent α is related to the magnetic energy
in the superconducting state. Interestingly, the incorporation of
10% Ni ions onto the Bi NPs gives rise to a large enhancement not
only of TC but also of HC. Accordingly, HC0 of the
12 nm Bi is (3.02 × 103)/(5.2 × 10–2) = 5.8 × 104 times higher than that of bulk Bi,
and HC0 of 11 nm Bi0.9Ni0.1 is another factor of 3.7/3.02 = 1.23 higher. In an NP,
where the particle diameter is much smaller than the magnetic penetration
depth, the magnetic flux will penetrate appreciably into the particle,
so that the increase in the internal energy due to the presence of
an Ha is much smaller for an NP than for
a bulk system. A significant increase in HC for NPs can then be anticipated. The exponent α reflects the
amount of applied magnetic energy that affects the SC. For bulk systems,
α = 2 is expected, because the whole applied magnetic energy
of Ha2/8π is affecting
the SC. In NPs, only a portion of the applied magnetic energy will
affect the SC because an appreciable amount of the magnetic field
penetrates into the NPs. An α < 2 may then be anticipated
for NPs, as shown in Figure 5. A smaller value of α = 0.45 is obtained for 11 nm
Bi0.9Ni0.1 NPs than α = 0.62 for 12 nm
Bi NPs, reflecting the magnetic energy affecting the SC that is less
for Bi0.9Ni0.1 NPs than for Bi NPs at an Ha.

of the magnetization
of the Bi0.9Ni0.1 NP assembly, measured in warming
processes with Ha = 50 Oe (open stars),
100 Oe (open triangles), 500 Oe (open squares), and 1 kOe (open circles)
after zero-field cooling to 2 K. The solid lines indicate the results
of the fits to Scalapino’s expression. (b) Variations of TC with Ha of the
Bi NP assembly. (c) Variations of TC with Ha of the Bi0.9Ni0.1 NP
assembly. The solid curves indicate the results of the fit of the
data to the expression listed in the plots. The HC0 obtained for the 11 nm Bi0.9Ni0.1 NPs is 23% higher than that obtained for the 12 nm Bi NPs.

5 FM in Superconducting State
The values of M for the Bi0.9Ni0.1 NPs in the normal state
are ∼3 times higher than those of the Bi NPs, showing the existence
of a magnetic component in the Bi0.9Ni0.1 NPs.
The field dependences of the isothermal M(Ha) of the Bi0.9Ni0.1 NPs
taken below TC can be described by a Langevin
field profile plus a positive linear term (solid lines in Figure 6a). The positive
linear term decreases with increasing temperature and is not visible
at 20 K. An additional Lenz linear diamagnetic component is needed
for the M(Ha) curves
taken at higher temperatures (Figure 6a). The observed Langevin M(Ha) may be understood as the magnetic moments
of the randomly oriented assembly of noninteracting Bi0.9Ni0.1 NPs that are being aligned by the Ha, which remains visible at 300 K. An average particle
moment of 563(9) μB is obtained for each Bi0.9Ni0.1 NP at 20 K, which corresponds to an average magnetic
moment of 0.03 μB for each Bi ion in the NP that
remains visible at 300 K. The isofield M(T) of the Bi0.9Ni0.1 NPs taken at
2 kOe departs from the Curie–Weiss profile below 17 K (Figure 6b). The transition
at 17 K is not linked to SC because TC at 2 kOe drops to 5 K. These further increases in magnetization
on cooling below 17 K are contributed from the magnetic moment of
the Ni ions, which become thermally disordered above 17 K.

Figure 6 (a) Isothermal M(Ha) curves of the Bi0.9Ni0.1 NP assembly,
measured in field-increasing loops
at various representative temperatures. The solid lines indicate the
results of the fit to a Langevin field profile plus a Lenz linear
diamagnetic term. (b) Temperature dependence of 1/M of the Bi0.9Ni0.1 NP assembly, measured at Ha = 2 kOe in a warming process after zero-field
cooling to 2 K. The solid line indicates the result of a linear fit
to the data about 20 K, revealing M(T) departs from the Curie–Weiss profile below 17 K. (c) Magnetization
loops of the Bi0.9Ni0.1 NP assembly at 2 K,
revealing the appearance of magnetic hysteresis with a coercive field
of 550 Oe and a remanence of 1.6 × 10–2 emu/g.

Magnetic
hysteresis is clearly seen even at 2 K (Figure 6c). The appearance of the Langevin isothermal M(Ha) and magnetic hysteresis
below TC reveals the coexistence of SC
and FM for the 11 nm Bi0.9Ni0.1 NPs in the superconducting
phase. SC persists up to TC = 18 K, whereas
FM remains at 300 K that is the highest temperature achieved in this
study. It is known that metallic NPs can develop ferromagnetic moments.33 The saturation magnetization MS of the 12 nm Bi NPs reaches 6 × 10–5 emu/g at 20 K, while that of the 11 nm Bi0.9Ni0.1 NPs can reach 3 × 10–2 emu/g. The much larger MS for the Bi0.9Ni0.1 NPs
shows that the Ni ions in the NPs do carry magnetic moments. However,
the MS of the Bi0.9Ni0.1 NPs is much smaller (∼103 lower) than that of
the fcc Ni in its bulk form. This is a direct result of the Ni ions
in the Bi0.9Ni0.1 NPs being so far apart that
the exchange interactions are significantly weaker.

6 Electronic Charge Density
The introduction of Ni ions to the rhombohedral Bi lattice sites
leads to a more intensive distribution of the outer electronic charge
density (ECD) toward the interconnecting regions between neighboring
ions, as a consequence of an outgoing shift of electrons from near
the lattice sites. These changes in the charge distribution are better
revealed in the difference ECD plots, where the ECD distribution of
the Bi NP assembly is subtracted from that of the BimNin NP assembly. Such difference
ECD plots for the Bi0.9Ni0.1 NP assembly are
illustrated in Figure 7, where the atomic positions with negative values for the difference
ECD represents the locations where the electronic charges are less
in Bi0.9Ni0.1 NPs, which have been redistributed
to the positions with positive values. These ECD maps are obtained
by employing the General Structure Analysis System (GSAS) program,
starting with profile refinements of the XRD patterns, followed by
calculation of the inverse Fourier transforms of the structure factors
to extract the electron density distribution. The electron density
contour map of a specific lattice plane is then obtained by slicing
the electron density in the vicinity, including 0.025 Å below
and above the plane.

Figure 7 (a) Crystalline
structure of rhombohedral Bi. The arrows indicate the positions in
the crystallographic c-axis direction where the ECD
is plotted. (b–e) Differences on the ECD between the Bi0.9Ni0.1 and Bi NP assemblies in the (b) z = 0.234, (c) z = 0.167, (d) z = 0.333, and (e) z = 0.284 crystallographic planes,
as inferred from the XRD data. The color bars are in units of e/Å3.

The crystalline structure of rhombohedral
Bi may be viewed as composed of wavy Bi layers that are stacked along
the crystallographic c-axis direction (Figure 7a). There is a significant
increase in the number of electronic charges in the interconnecting
region between two neighboring Bi ions within the layers, revealing
a threefold symmetry for the additional ECD distribution in the Bi
lattice plane (z = 0.234) of the wavy layer (Figure 7b). The regions with
negative values in the difference ECD extend about half way toward
its nearest neighbors, showing not only that the outer electrons but
also the inner electrons become more extended distributed after Ni-doping.
The additional electronic charges are more focused at specific locations
in the inner regions of the wavy layers. A sixfold symmetry of the
additional ECD is seen in the z = 0.167 layer, as
viewed from the center of the wavy hexagonal honeycomb web (Figure 7c). The changes in
the ECD in the inner regions of the wavy layers can be as high as
±0.03 e/Å3. Approaching the interlayer regions,
it is interesting to see that the additional electronic charges appear
more in the central region between two neighboring layers (Figure 7d) than closer to
the layers (Figure 7e). A smaller number of electronic charges shifts to the interlayer
region than to within the layers, as shown in Figure 8, where the contour surfaces for a difference
ECD of +0.02 e/Å3 are marked by light (light blue)
shading while those for −0.02 e/Å3 are marked
by dark (vermillion) shading. Apparently, the change in the spatial
distribution of the electronic charge from Ni-doping does not extend
isotopically in all crystallographic directions, but rather a portion
of electrons shift from specific regions to others. The redistribution
involves not only spherically distributed 6s electrons but also includes
directional 6p electrons and perhaps 5d electrons as well.

of 10% Ni onto Bi NPs, as obtained from the XRD data. The regions
with a difference in the ECD of +0.02 e/Å3 are marked
by light (light blue) shading, while those with a difference of −0.02
e/Å3 are marked in dark (vermillion) shading.

7 Density Functional Theory Calculation
To better understand the origins of the enhanced SC and FM induced
in rhombohedral Bi by Ni-doping, we performed first-principles calculations
on BimNin,
modeled with a partial replacement of the Bi ions by Ni ions. The
atomic configuration where each Ni ion is surrounded by eight Bi ions
is the structure that most closely resembles Bi0.9Ni0.1. This can be achieved by viewing the rhombohedra unit cell
along the [−1, 2, 1], [2, −1, 1], and [−1, −1,
1] crystallographic directions.34 We then
constructed a 24-atom supercell by taking the rhombohedra unit cell
along the [−1, 2, 1] crystallographic direction and doubling
the unit cell along the [2, −1, 1] and [−1, −1,
1] crystallographic directions, with three Bi atoms being replaced
by three Ni atoms to form three neighboring Bi7Ni1. The structural parameters (lattice constants and atomic positions)
obtained from high-resolution XRD measurements were used without performing
any structural optimization. The density functional theory (DFT) calculation
was performed using the generalized gradient approximation exchange–correlation
functional framework suggested by Perdew, Burke, and Ernzerhof,35 the projector augmented wave representation,36,37 and a plane-wave basis set as implemented in the Vienna ab initio
simulation package (VASP).38−41 7 × 7 × 14 k-sampling was adopted to sample the first Brillouin zone.
The energy cut-off for plane-wave energy was set to be 400 eV, and
an error of less than 10–6 eV allowed for self-consistent
calculation. Spin–orbit coupling was also considered in both
the Bi8 and the Bi7Ni1 systems, which
is known to be crucial for the band structure calculation in bulk
Bi.42

Redistribution of the outer
electronic charges resulting from the incorporation of Ni ions onto
the vicinity of Bi ions is clearly revealed in the calculated ECD.
Several features may be identified in the difference plots between
the ECD of Bi7Ni1 and Bi8: (1) the
appearance of a larger number of electronic charges in the outer regions
of the Ni sites (Figure 9a), reflecting the fact that Ni ions possess more valence electrons
than Bi ions; (2) the outer electronic charges appear to be focused
more at specific positions but do not indicate a rhombohedral symmetry
(Figure 9a,b), showing
the occurrence of a shift in the electronic charge from Ni sites to
neighboring Bi sites; (3) the appearance of a larger number of electronic
charges in the interconnecting regions between two neighboring Bi
ions (Figure 9a); and
(4) a directional shift of the electronic charge away from Ni sites
(Figure 9a,b).

e/Å3 are marked in dark (red) shading, while those
of +0.005 e/Å3 are marked light (yellow) shading.

plot) crystallographic planes, as calculated using the 24-atom supercell

The DFT calculations also show that Ni-doping gives rise to a large
increase of the DOS near the Fermi energy EF. Interestingly, the DOS near EF for
the Bi7Ni1 can be as much as 14 times that of
Bi8 (Figure 10a). This large increase of DOS near the EF is mainly contributed from the d-orbitals of the Ni
ions in Bi7Ni1, which generate a large number
of electronic states within a narrow energy range near EF (Figure 10b). The electronic states contributed from the Bi ions, on the other
hand, spread over a wide range in energy and with a much smaller DOS
when is compared to that from the Ni ions (Figure 10c). The DOS near EF of Bi7Ni1 are mainly contributed from
the Ni-d and Bi-p orbitals, which give rise to a large enhancement
in the DOS near the EF. Clearly, the hybridization
between the Ni-d and Bi-p orbitals in BimNin distort the rhombohedra symmetry
of the ECD distribution. A significant amount of electronic states
renormalized from below the Fermi level to near and above upon incorporation
of Ni ions onto the Bi sites (Figure 10d). In addition, a magnetic moment of 0.28 μB is obtained in the calculation for the Ni-d state in Bi7Ni1, with an orbital moment which is about 20%
that of the spin moment. Table 2 lists the calculated spin and orbital moments along the three
crystallographic axis directions. Apparently, the embedment of smaller
Ni atoms onto the Bi crystalline matrix allows the 3d84s2 outer electrons of Ni to distribute toward the interconnecting
regions between two neighboring ions and the electronic states of
Ni-d orbitals give rise to additional DOS near the Fermi level.

8 Conclusions
In
this report, we demonstrated that the TC and HC of rhombohedral Bi NPs can be
greatly enhanced by the incorporation of Ni ions onto the NPs. A more
than fourfold increase of TC to 18 K is
found after the incorporation of 10% Ni into 11 nm Bi NPs. The isothermal
magnetization reveals a Langevin field profile, and magnetic hysteresis
is clearly revealed in the superconducting phase, showing the coexistence
of SC and FM. Three key factors that enhance the SC in rhombohedral
Bi NPs upon Ni-doping have been identified. Among them, the largest
enhancement to the superconducting coupling strength is the enlarged
DOS near the Fermi level contributed from the Ni-d orbitals. The DOS
near Fermi level for the Bi7Ni1 can be as much
as 14 times that of the Bi8. Second, the Ni ions serve
to supply charges that deliver electronic charges to the interconnecting
region between two neighboring Bi ions, which occurs because more
valence electrons are available in Ni (3d84s2) than in Bi (6s26p3). Third, Ni-doping causes
the lattice to shrink (by 0.3% at 300 K) which strengthens the lattice
coupling between the Bi ions, resulted from a smaller ionic radius
for Ni ion than for Bi ion. The enhancement from the stronger lattice
coupling is relatively weak compared with that arising from changes
in the electronic states. We remark finally that we found no evidence
of the existence of magnetic coupling for SC in Ni-doped Bi NPs, as
the superconducting transition temperature does shift to a lower temperature
under the application of a magnetic field as weak as 50 Oe.
