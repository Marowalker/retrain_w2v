Gout
is a disease with elusive treatment options. Reduction of
the size of l-alanine crystals as a model crystal for gouty
tophi with the use of a monomode solid-state microwave was examined
as a possible therapeutic aid. The effect of microwave heating on l-alanine crystals in the presence of gold nanoparticles (Au
NPs) in solution and synovial fluid (SF) in a plastic pouch through
a synthetic skin patch was investigated. In this regard, three experimental
paradigms were employed: Paradigm 1 includes the effect of variable
microwave power (5–10 W) and variable heating time (5–60
s) and Au NPs in water (20 nm size, volume of 10 μL) in a plastic
pouch (1 × 2 cm2 in size). Paradigm 2 includes the
effect of a variable volume of 20 nm Au NPs in a variable volume of
SF up to 100 μL in a plastic pouch at a constant microwave power
(10 W) for 30 s. Paradigm 3 includes the effect of constant microwave
power (10 W) and microwave heating time (30 s), constant volume of
Au NPs (100 μL), and variable size of Au NPs (20–200
nm) placed in a plastic pouch through a synthetic skin patch. In these
experiments, an average of 60–100% reduction in the size of
an l-alanine crystal (initial size = 450 μm) without
damage to the synthetic skin or increasing the temperature of the
samples beyond the physiological range was reported.

Introduction
The incidence of hyperuricemia
(serum urate levels >7.0 mg/dL for
men; >5.7 mg/dL for women), the predecessor of gout, is increasing
in the US1−3 and at epidemic proportions worldwide.4,5 Genetics, aging population, several disease states (e.g., hypertension,
hypothyroidism, insulin resistance, and renal insufficiency), and
lifestyle factors (e.g., appalling increases in morbid obesity, a
purine-rich diet, extensive use of thiazide diuretics and low-dose
aspirin therapy, and increased consumption of alcohol) contribute
to the increased prevalence of hyperuricemia and gout.6,7 Gout, caused by a purine metabolism disorder, is an ancient crystal-induced
form of inflammatory arthritis.2,5,8 Uric acid, the final product of purine catabolism, is excreted from
the body in urine.9 Ninety-eight percentage
of uric acid circulates in plasma and synovial fluid (SF) as the mono-deprotonated
ionic form, urate3 [monosodium urate monohydrate
(MSUM)]. Deposition of needlelike MSUM crystals triggers an inflammatory
immune response in the joint,10 and persistent
MSUM deposition can develop into chronic tophaceous gout.

Currently,
acute gout is managed by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory
drugs (NSAIDs), colchicine and corticosteroids. NSAIDs are known to
have numerous side effects.11−13 In chronic gout patients, invasive
tophi removal surgery is advised, which can lead to joint infection
and/or permanent joint damage or in some cases can lead to amputation.14,15 To date, decisions to use various gout therapies have been based
on the efficacies and adverse effect profiles of these drugs and the
patient’s ability to tolerate the prescribed doses. With the
increased incidence of and the long-term medical implications and
economic burden of treatment failure, chronic arthritis, and patients
in whom standard
gout therapies are prohibited, it is imperative that novel gout treatments
to be developed.

The Aslan Research Group has recently introduced
and demonstrated
a noninvasive, nonpharmaceutical, relatively inexpensive technique
called metal-assisted and microwave-accelerated decrystallization
(MAMAD),16 which is based on the combined
use of gold nanoparticles (Au NPs) and low-power microwave heating
and has the potential to be an alternative treatment for gout during
and after the formation of tophi in humans. Subsequently, it is important
to briefly mention the previous uses of microwaves, synthetic skin,
and Au NPs in biomedical applications.

Microwaves are used as
therapeutic agents (diathermy, hyperthermia
therapy, and radiofrequency lesioning and ablation) to diagnose and
treat cancer and in various other diagnostic procedures.17,18 Deep-penetrating lower frequency microwaves (915 MHz and 2.45 GHz)
have been used for ablation of tumors in the prostate, liver, and
lungs and coagulation of blood in the liver and spleen. Shallow-penetrating
higher frequency microwaves (5.8–10 GHz) have been used to
ablate cardiac arrhythmias, corneas, damaged spinal nerves, metastatic
livers, plantar warts, skin cancers, uterine fibroids, and varicose
veins.17−20 Microwave energy is transformed into thermal energy upon exposure
of dielectric substances (i.e., weak electricity conductors and strong
electrostatic field supporters with induced or inherent dipoles) to
certain frequencies of microwave irradiation.21 Whether microwave heating will induce thermal skin damage depends
on the microwave exposure time, power, and frequency and the absorption
rate, sensitivity, and hydration level of the irradiated tissue.22,23 Microwave heating of the skin, a laminar tissue in which the outer
layer (stratum corneum) is considerably less hydrated than the deeper
granular tissues, induces continuous polar molecule realignment in
an alternating electromagnetic field (i.e., molecular dipole rotation).22 As the current in the electromagnetic field
alternates, the molecules continuously reverse direction. The continuous
rotation of polar molecules and their collision with the nearby molecules
causes kinetic energy to be transformed into thermal energy.24−26 Where normal and damaged skin falls on the dielectric spectrum depends
on the degree to which the stratum corneum is hydrated, which in turn
affects the depth of penetration of microwaves into the tissue.27 Synovial joints and surrounding soft tissues
are more hydrated than the skin and therefore have greater dielectric
properties. In patients with chronic tophaceous gout, the dielectric properties of the skin, synovial joints, and tissues
necessitate the use of appropriate levels of microwave power to penetrate
these tissues and decrystallize joint-embedded crystal aggregates.
Therefore, before using microwave heating and Au NPs in gout patients,
the extent of microwave heating-induced tissue damage (if any) must
be determined using synthetic skin patches to simulate human skin.

Synthetic skin patches used in our experiments to simulate adult
human skin were validated for dielectric constant, thermal conductivity,
puncture pressure, and so forth under similar physical conditions
as the human tissue it was designed to mimic.28 The puncture pressure (2 N/mm2) and the realistic texture
and consistency of the synthetic skin are similar to those of the
human skin, which has a puncture pressure of 2.5 ± 0.3 N/mm2.29 As determined by SynDaver Labs,
there are striking similarities between the synthetic skin used in
these experiments and the human skin, resulting in a human skin analog
that responds to various stimuli in a manner similar to the actual
skin. In these experiments, synthetic skin patches were used to determine
the extent to which microwave heating induced tissue damage and whether
the l-alanine crystals could be decrystallized in the presence
of Au NPs through a synthetic skin patch using our MAMAD technique.

Au NPs, which have a myriad of biomedical applications, have unique
physical, chemical, and electronic properties that enable multimodal,
site-specific therapeutic delivery, and their nanometer size confers
the ability to permeate cellular membranes and interact with biomolecules.30,31 The MAMAD technique is based on the combined use of Au NPs that
are dispersed within an aqueous solution and low-power microwave heating,
where a microwave-induced temperature gradient is created between
the cooler Au NPs and the warmer microwave-heated solution. Decrystallization
of target crystals is based on the microwave heating-induced temperature
gradient and the time, frequency, and power of microwave heating.
The unique feature of the combined use of Au NPs in solution and microwave
heating for the potential treatment of gout is the absorption and
reflection of electromagnetic energy and the subsequent conversion
to kinetic energy when Au NPs are exposed to microwave heating. The
microwave heating-induced increase in the kinetic energy of Au NPs
causes them to collide with the adjacent target crystals in solution,
effectively turning the Au NPs into “nanobullets,” which
shatter and eventually decrease the surface area of the target crystals.32

The purpose of this study was to investigate
the effect of microwave
heating (using a medically approved microwave source) of target crystals
(i.e., l-alanine as a model crystal for tophi) in the presence
of Au NPs in a plastic pouch (a model joint capsule) through a synthetic
skin patch (a model for human skin) using three different experimental
paradigms. A monomode, solid-state microwave source operating at 8
GHz and a variable power up to 20 W and an applicator that focuses
the microwave energy to a ∼5 mm circular area were employed.
First, we used a plastic pouch with two different microwave powers
and various microwave time intervals in the presence of a constant
size and volume of Au NPs (paradigm 1). Second, we employed a plastic
pouch with microwave power at 10 W and a 30 s time interval and a
mixture of different volumes of Au NPs and SF (paradigm 2). Finally,
we utilized a plastic pouch under a synthetic skin patch with microwave
power at 10 W and a 30 s time interval and 30 μL volume of different
sizes of Au NPs (paradigm 3). In these experiments, we sought to determine
whether an 8 GHz microwave applicator (at 5 or 10 W) could decrystallize
a large (up to ∼450 μm in size and weighing ∼0.10
mg) l-alanine crystal in a plastic pouch containing Au NPs
with or without SF and with or without a synthetic skin patch. These
experiments using simulated human skin over l-alanine crystals
are important for future applications of our MAMAD technique for the
treatment of patients with tophaceousgout. To determine whether the change in the temperature after microwave
heating of the plastic pouch and synthetic skin patch would exceed
the physiological range and/or cause tissue damage, we assessed the
microwave heating-induced temperature changes via an infrared thermometer
and the synthetic skin damage qualitatively and quantitatively via
real-time temperature measurements and optical microscopy.

Results
and Discussion
In this study, three different experimental
paradigms were used
to decrystallize l-alanine crystals via the MAMAD technique,
as shown in Figure 1. In experimental paradigm 1, a plastic pouch with two different
microwave powers (5 or 10 W), various microwave time intervals (5,
10, 20, 30, 40, or 60 s), and Au NPs of size 20 nm and volume 10 μL
were used. Experimental paradigm 2 employed a plastic pouch with a
constant microwave power (10 W) and time interval (30 s) and varying
volumes of Au NPs (10, 50, or 100 μL) and SF (10, 50, or 100
μL). Experimental paradigm 3 utilized a plastic pouch and synthetic
skin patch with a constant microwave power (10 W) and time interval
(30 s) and a constant Au NP volume (30 μL) with varying sizes
of Au NPs (20, 200, or 200 nm). In addition, control experiments related
to all experimental paradigms in this study were carried out under
identical conditions (except microwave heating) at room temperature.
Because the long-term goal of this research project is to determine
whether the MAMAD technique using low-power microwave-accelerated
Au NPs can be used to decrystallize MSUM deposits in patients suffering
from gout, the experiments detailed in this paper were undertaken.
We sought to determine to what extent, if any, low-power microwave
heating would induce surface area changes in the synthetic skin patches
(i.e., cause tissue damage). In addition, it is important to determine
whether the temperature increases after microwave heating were within
the physiological range (36–38 °C).

Figure 1 Schematic representation
of the three paradigms used in the decrystallization
of l-alanine crystals on iCrystal plates via the MAMAD technique.
(A) Paradigm 1: within a plastic pouch (no synthetic skin patch),
the microwave power (5 or 10 W) and time intervals (5, 10, 20, 30,
40, or 60 s) were changed, the size (20 nm) and volume (10 μL)
of Au NPs were kept constant, and no SF was used. (B) Paradigm 2:
within a plastic pouch (no synthetic skin patch), the microwave power
(10 W), time interval (30 s), and Au NP size (20 nm) were kept constant,
and the volumes (10, 50, or 100 μL) of Au NPs and SF (10, 50,
or 100 μL) were changed (C) Paradigm 3: within a plastic pouch
through the synthetic skin patch, the microwave power (10 W), time
interval (30 s), and volume (30 μL) of Au NPs were kept constant,
and the size (20, 100, or 200 nm) of Au NPs was changed.

Paradigm 1 was used to determine the change in
the surface area
of l-alanine crystals and the final temperature of the plastic
pouch after 120 s (at 5 s time intervals) of microwave heating at
5 or 10 W. Figure 2 shows the graphs of the percentage change in the surface area of l-alanine crystals in a plastic pouch (A) and the final temperature
of the pouch (B) after 120 s (at 5 s time intervals) of microwave
heating at 5 or 10 W. Optical images of l-alanine crystals
during microwave heating show a decrease in the l-alanine
crystal surface area from 100% at t = 0 s to 22.4
± 16.7% at t = 120 s at 5 W (C), a decrease
in the surface area from 100% at t = 0 s to 24.7
± 19.2% at t = 120 s at 10 W (D), and a decrease
in the surface area from 100% at t = 0 s to 92.6
± 5.3% at t = 120 s at room temperature. At
5 and 10 W, there were no significant changes in the temperature measured
at 120 s of microwave heating compared to 0 s. Because microwave heating
at 10 W caused no significant plastic pouch temperature increases,
we opted to use microwave heating at 10 W for the reminder of our
experiments to ensure sufficient microwave power to penetrate the
synthetic skin patches. These data suggest that low-power microwave-induced
temperature increases were within the physiological range. It is important
to note that similar results were obtained with respect to the percentage
change in the crystal surface area and initial versus final pouch
temperatures with microwave heating when 10, 20, 30, 40, and 60 s
intervals of microwave heating at 5 or 10 W were examined (Figures
S1–S5, Supporting Information).

Figure 3 shows the
bar graph summary of data related to the time-dependent change in
the surface area of l-alanine crystals and temperature collected
from three different paradigm 1 experimental trials. The percentage
change in the surface area of l-alanine crystals in a plastic
pouch after microwave heating at different time intervals (5, 10,
20, 30, 40, and 60 s) (A) and the final temperature of the plastic
pouch after 60 s of microwave heating at 5 or 10 W (B) are shown.
There was no significant change in the surface area of the l-alanine crystals after 60 s of microwave heating at 5 or 10 W. At
no time point studied did the microwave heating-induced increase in
the pouch temperature exceed the physiological range. The final temperature
of the pouch after 60 s of microwave heating was not significantly
different (∼6–7 °C) from the initial temperature.

from three different experimental trials. (A) Percentage change in

120 s of microwave heating at 5 or 10 W. Ti = initial temperature of the plastic pouch before the commencement

deviation of the three different experiments.

Figure 4 shows
the
summary graphs of data collected from the three different paradigm
2 experimental trials used to determine the most effective volumes
of Au NPs and SF to decrystallize l-alanine crystals in a
plastic pouch during 120 s (at 30 s time intervals) of microwave heating
at 10 W. In the absence of SF, the smallest volume (10 μL) of
Au NPs resulted in only a decrease of 30% in the crystal size. The
30 s time point was chosen as the minimum microwave heating time required
to induce the surface area and pouch temperature changes. The following
comparisons were made at the 30 s time point: In the presence of Au
NPs at the medium volume (50 μL), the crystal size was reduced
by 60%. The largest volume (100 μL) of Au NPs resulted in a
90% decrease in the crystal size. In the absence of Au NPs, SF (10
μL) resulted in a reduction of the crystal size by only 30%,
and both the 50 and 100 μL volumes decreased the crystal size
by 50% as compared to Au NPs (100 μL) in the absence of SF,
which decreased the crystal size by 90%. A mixture of 10 μL
of SF and 10 μL of Au NPs resulted in only a 30% reduction in
the crystal size. In the presence of the smallest volume (10 μL)
of Au NPs, both the 50 and 100 μL volumes of SF resulted in
a decrease in the crystal size by 50%. A mixture of 10 μL of
SF and 50 μL of Au NPs resulted in a 50% reduction in the crystal
size, whereas 50 μL of SF mixed with 50 μL of Au NPs decreased
the crystal size by 70%. SF (100 μL) in the presence of Au NPs
(50 μL) resulted in a 90% reduction in the crystal size. SF
(10 or 50 μL) in the presence of Au NPs (100 μL) resulted
in a 100% reduction in the crystal size, whereas SF (100 μL)
in the presence of Au NPs (100 μL) resulted in a 70% reduction
of the crystal size, which is not statistically significant. These
data demonstrate that the presence of Au NPs with or without SF resulted
in a decrease in the l-alanine crystal size. The control
samples showed insignificant changes in the absence of microwave heating
when compared to experimental samples. The average reduction in the
surface area of an l-alanine crystal in 10, 50, and 100 μL
of Au NPs at room temperature was 6.6, 17.5, and 26.3%, respectively,
and l-alanine crystal submerged in 10, 50, and 100 μL
of SF only had a reduction of 0.3, 4.4, and 6.7%, respectively. In
the initial mixture of Au NPs (10 μL) and SF (10, 50, and 100
μL), the surface area reduction of the l-alanine crystal
was 19.7, 13.2 and 12.7%, and in the second mixture of Au NPs (50
μL) and SF (10, 50, and 100 μL), the surface area reduction
of the l-alanine crystal was 17.1, 19.4, and 23.5%, and in
the final mixture of Au NPs (100 μL) and SF (10, 50, and 100
μL), the average reduction in the surface area of l-alanine crystal was 9.5, 24.5, and 17.7%, respectively. The final
temperature of the plastic pouch containing various mixtures of Au
NPs (10, 50, and 100 μL) and SF (10, 50, and 100 μL) during
120 s (at 30 s time intervals) of microwave heating at 10 W was similar
to the initial pouch temperature. (Figures S6 and S9, Supporting Information). There were no significant
changes in the temperature measured after 120 s (at 30 s time intervals)
of microwave heating at 10 W compared to 0 s in any of the mixtures
of Au NPs and SF tested. Control experiments were performed at room
temperature.

Figure 4 Paradigm 2: pouch: Au NPs + SF volume (10 W, 30 s time
intervals).
Summary of data collected from three different paradigm 2 experiments.
Percentage change in the surface area (%) of l-alanine crystals
in a plastic pouch during 120 s (at 30 s time intervals) of microwave
heating at 10 W. Data are presented as the mean ± standard deviation
of the three different experiments. Table shows the 15 experimental
groups used in this study: 1–3 Au NPs (10, 50, or 100 μL)
alone, 4–6 SF (10, 50, or 100 μL) alone, and 7–15
SF (10, 50, or 100 μL) + Au NPs (10, 50, or 100 μL).

Paradigm 2 was used to determine
the effect of different volumes
of Au NPs alone or SF alone to decrystallize (i.e., decrease the surface
area) l-alanine crystals in a plastic pouch. Figure 5, panel A shows the optical
images of the observed change in the surface area of l-alanine
crystals in a plastic pouch containing different volumes of Au NPs
(10, 50, and 100 μL; no SF) during 120 s (at 30 s time intervals)
of microwave heating at 10 W. Panel B shows the optical images of l-alanine crystals in a plastic pouch containing different volumes
of SF (10, 50, and 100 μL) with no Au NPs during 120 s (at 30
s time intervals) of microwave heating at 10 W. These data demonstrate
that the 100 μL volume of Au NPs resulted in the dramatic decrease
in the crystal size at the 30 s time and disappearance of the crystal
by the 60 s time point. On the other hand, the highest volume of SF
did not totally decrystallize the l-alanine crystal by the
120 s time point.

Figure 5 Paradigm 2: pouch: Au NPs + SF volume (10 W, 30 s time
intervals).
Optical images of the observed change in the surface area of l-alanine crystals in a plastic pouch containing different volumes
of Au NPs (10, 50, and 100 μL; no SF) (A) or different volumes
of SF (10, 50, and 100 μL; no Au NPs) (B) during 120 s (at 30
s time intervals) of microwave heating at 10 W.

In addition, paradigm 2 was used to determine the effect
of different
volumes of Au NPs mixed with SF on the size of l-alanine
crystals after 120 s (at 30 s time intervals) of microwave heating
at 10 W. Figure 6,
panels A–C show the optical images of the observed change in
the surface area of l-alanine crystals in a plastic pouch
containing different volumes of Au NPs (10, 50, and 100 μL)
mixed with different volumes of SF (10, 50, and 100 μL) during
120 s (at 30 s time intervals) of microwave heating at 10 W. These
results demonstrate that the highest volume of Au NPs (100 μL)
in the presence of SF (10, 50, and 100 μL) resulted in a greater
reduction in the crystal than the two lower volumes of Au NPs (10
and 50 μL).

Figure 6 Paradigm 2: pouch: Au NPs + SF volume (10 W, 30 s time
intervals).
Summary of data collected from three different paradigm 2 experiments.
Percentage change in the surface area (%) of l-alanine crystals
in a plastic pouch during 120 s (at 30 s time intervals) of microwave
heating at 10 W. Data are presented as the mean ± standard deviation
of the three different experiments. Table shows the 15 experimental
groups used in this study: 1–3 (A) 10 μL of Au NPs (10,
50, or 100 μL of SF), 4–6 (B) 50 μL of Au NPs (10,
50, or 100 μL of SF), and 7–15 (C) 100 μL of Au
NPs (10, 50, or 100 μL of SF).

Paradigm 2 was also used to determine the effect of different
volumes
of Au NPs and SF on the plastic pouch final temperature after 120
s (at 30 s time intervals) of microwave heating at 10 W. Figure 7 shows the results
of three different trials using paradigm 2 to determine the change
in the temperature of the plastic pouch containing Au NPs only (A,
no SF) and SF only (B, no Au NPs) for 120 s (at 30 s time intervals)
of microwave heating at 10 W. There was no significant change in the
plastic pouch final temperature after 120 s (at 30 s time intervals)
of microwave heating at 10 W with 10, 50, or 100 μL of Au NPs
or SF. In the presence of Au NPs or SF (10, 50, or 100 μL),
there were no significant differences between the initial and final
pouch temperatures after microwave heating at 10 W. After microwave
heating at 10 W for 120 s (at 30 s time intervals), the modest increases
in the temperature (up to 4 °C) would not denature proteins,
and therefore, the MAMAD technique could be used in patients with
gout.

Figure 7 Paradigm 2: pouch: Au NPs + SF volume (10 W, 30 s time intervals).
Change in the temperature (°C) of the plastic pouch containing
(A) Au NPs only (no SF) and (B) SF only (no Au NPs) for 120 s (every
30 s) of microwave heating at 10 W. T1, T2, and T3 indicate three
different experiments, trials 1, 2, and 3, respectively.

Paradigm 3 was used to determine whether an l-alanine
crystal in a plastic pouch could be decrystallized under a synthetic
skin patch, during exposure to 120 s (at 20 s time intervals) of microwave
heating at 10 W. Figure 8 shows the summary of data collected from three different paradigm
3 experimental trials used to determine the percentage change in the
surface area of an l-alanine crystal in a plastic pouch through
a synthetic skin patch and the change in the synthetic skin surface
area during exposure to 120 s (at 20 s time intervals) of microwave
heating at 10 W. In addition, the final temperature of the pouch after
120 s (at 20 s time intervals) of microwave heating at 10 W was determined.
At 120 s, in the presence of Au NPs (20 nm), there was a 50% reduction
in the size of the l-alanine crystal. There was a 65% reduction
in the crystal size in the presence of 100 nm Au NPs and a decrease
in the crystal size of 95% with 200 nm of Au NPs. Moreover, Au NPs
(20 and 200 nm) produced only a 10% reduction in the surface area
of the synthetic skin patch after 120 s of microwave heating (at 30
s time intervals) at 10 W, whereas Au NPs resulted in a 30% reduction
of the crystal. There was no significant change in the final temperature
of the plastic pouch after 120 s (at 30 s time intervals) of microwave
heating at 10 W. We also examined the change in the crystal surface
area under the synthetic skin patch and the change in the synthetic
skin surface area during exposure to 120 s (at 40 or 60 s time intervals)
of microwave heating at 10 W and showed that there were no significant
changes in the final temperature compared to the initial temperature
of the plastic pouch (Figures S8–S10, Supporting Information).

experiments. (A) Percentage change in the surface area (%) of l-alanine crystals in a plastic pouch through the synthetic
skin patch and a schematic representation of the microwave probe,

Au NP solution and one l-alanine crystal. (B) Percentage
change in the surface are (%) of the synthetic skin during 120 s (at
20 s time intervals) of microwave heating at 10 W and room temperature.
Data are presented as the mean ± standard deviation of the three
different experiments. The sizes of Au NPs used in these trials are
20, 100, and 200 nm.

In Figure 9, real-color,
high-resolution pictures show the percentage change in the surface
area of an l-alanine crystal in a plastic pouch through a
synthetic skin patch before (0 s) and after 120 s (at 20 s time intervals)
of microwave heating at 10 W (paradigm 3). Using 20 nm Au NPs, there
was a decrease in the l-alanine crystal surface area from
100% at t = 0 s to 27.5 ± 10.3% at t = 20 s. At the 20 s time point, the use of 100 nm Au NPs resulted
in a decreased crystal surface area of 100% at t =
0 s to 30.2 ± 8.6% at t = 20 s, and 200 nm Au
NPs resulted in a decrease from 100% at t = 0 s to
51.8 ± 7.6% at t = 20 s (A). The table in panel
B in Figure 9 shows
the percentage change in the surface area of l-alanine crystals
in plastic pouches, containing various sizes of Au NPs (20, 100, or
200 nm), under a synthetic skin patch after microwave heating from
0 to 120 s (at 20 s time intervals) at 10 W. In the presence of 20
nm Au NPs, the crystal surface area was reduced from 100% at t = 0 s to 40.8 ± 11.0% at t = 20
s, 49.4 ± 2.5% at t = 40 s, 44.6 ± 7.3%
at t = 60 s, and 27.5 ± 10.3% at t = 120 s. In the presence of 100 nm Au NPs, the crystal surface area
is decreased from 100% at t = 0 s to 34.4 ±
18.2% at t = 20 s, 47.1 ± 29.2% at t = 40 s, 27.8 ± 20.1% at t = 60 s, and 30.2
± 8.6% at t = 120 s. Au NPs at 200 nm resulted
in a decrease in the crystal surface area from 100% at t = 0 s to 7.16 ± 4.6% at t = 20 s, 30.9 ±
15.1% at t = 40 s, 25.6 ± 9.9% at t = 60 s, and 51.8 ± 7.6% at t = 120 s. Real-color,
high-resolution pictures show no difference in the percentage change
in the crystal surface area under a synthetic skin patch before (0
s) and after 120 s (at 40 and 60 s time intervals) of microwave heating
at 10 W (Figure S11, Supporting Information). In addition, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of an l-alanine crystal in a plastic pouch through a synthetic skin
patch before (0 s) and after (120 s) microwave heating for 120 s at
10 W in the presence of Au NPs (20, 100, or 200 nm) were examined
(Figure S11, Supporting Information).

the plastic pouch containing the Au NP solution and one l-alanine crystal. The table in panel B shows the percentage change
in the surface area of l-alanine crystals in plastic pouches,
containing various sizes of Au NPs (20, 100, or 200 nm), under the
synthetic skin patch after microwave heating for 0, 20, 40, 60, or
120 s at 10 W.

In Figure 10, real-color,
high-resolution pictures show the percentage change in the surface
area of an l-alanine crystal in a plastic pouch through a
synthetic skin patch before (0 s) and after 120 s of microwave heating
at 10 W (paradigm 3). At the 120 s time point, using 20 nm Au NPs,
there was a decrease in the l-alanine crystal surface area
from 100% at t = 0 s to 27.5 ± 10.3% at 120
s. The use of 100 nm Au NPs resulted in a decreased crystal surface
area from 100% at 0 s to 30.2 ± 8.6% at 120 s, and 200 nm Au
NPs resulted in a decrease from 100% at 0 s to 51.8 ± 7.6% at
120 s (A). Panel B shows the SEM micrographs of the decrystallization
of l-alanine crystals in plastic pouches through synthetic
skin patches before and after microwave heating for 120 s at 10 W.

as the mean ± standard deviation of the three different experiments.
The sizes of the Au NPs used in this trial are 20, 100, and 200 nm.

In these experiments, we sought
to determine whether the change
in the temperature after microwave heating of the plastic pouch under
the synthetic skin patch would exceed the physiological range or cause
tissue damage. In conclusion, these results demonstrate qualitatively
and quantitatively via real-time temperature measurements and optical
microscopy that an l-alanine crystal in a plastic pouch can
be decrystallized through a synthetic skin patch using microwave heating
in the presence of Au NPs without damage to the skin or exceeding
physiological temperatures. These results bring us much closer to
the possibility of using the MAMAD technique for the decrystallization
of gout-induced crystal deposits through the mammalian skin.

resistivity at 25 °C, which indicates low levels of anionic contamination
(EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA). Synthetic skin was stored in
antialgae solution purchased from The Clorox Company (Lawrenceville,
GA, USA).

8 GHz solid-state microwave generator was obtained from Emblation
Microwave (Inglewood, Alloa, Scotland, UK). A digital microscope camera
UM12 5 MP USB was obtained from ViTiny (Taylors, SC, USA), and a Nikon
SMZ800 digital stereomicroscope was purchased from Nikon Instruments
Inc. (Melville, NY, USA). An infrared thermometer (IR1000 12:1) was

The X-ray powder diffraction instrument was purchased from Rigaku
MiniFlex (The Woodlands, TX, USA). A tabletop Impulse 4″ sealer
(model H#458) was obtained from Uline Inc. (Pleasant Prairie, WI,
USA). Polyurethane plastic pouches were made from 2-mil poly tubing
purchased from Uline (Pleasant Prairie, WI, USA). A 4.5 mm sterile
biopsy punch was purchased from Acuderm Inc. (Lauderdale, FL, USA).

The iCrystal plates [silicon isolators and poly(methyl methacrylate)]
were designed by the Aslan Research Group and produced in-house using
silicon isolators purchased from Grace Bio-Labs (Portland, OR USA).
Glass slides, coverslips (microslides; thickness: 0.96–1.06
mm), 20 mL scintillation vials, stir bars, and thermometers were purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). Cyanoacrylate (Gorilla Glue)
was purchased from Gorilla Glue, Inc. (Cincinnati, OH, USA). ImageJ,
image processing, and analysis in Java Software (https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/) and SigmaPlot 12.5 Systat Software, Inc. (San Jose, CA, USA) were
used to determine the extent of decrystallization of l-alanine
crystals.

Preparation of the Synthetic Skin Patches
A scalpel
was used to adjust the thickness of the synthetic skin plate to an
anatomical range of 1.5–2 mm, which more closely approximates
human skin layers. Cyanoacrylate was used to bond the epidermis, dermis,
subcutaneous, and muscle layers together. The bonded synthetic skin
was cut into patches (4 mm × 4 mm width; 5 mm depth) via a scalpel.
Synthetic skin patches, which were processed under a laminar flow
hood, were immersed in antialgae solution (60 mL of antialgae solution
in 4500 mL of deionized water and refrigerated at 4 °C), used
to prevent contamination and to maintain synthetic skin integrity,
and were stored in sealed 20 mL scintillation vials and refrigerated
at 4 °C. The bonded synthetic skin was 6 mm thick: 1 mm epidermis,
1 mm dermis, 2 mm subcutaneous fat layer, and 2 mm muscle layer. In
humans, the skin thickness at a tophi site ranges from 2–4
mm. The synthetic skin used in these experiments was 2 mm thicker
than the human skin tissue at a tophi site. Before each experiment,
the synthetic skin patches were warmed to 20 to 22 °C via an
incubator. l-Alanine crystals were placed in each iCrystal
plate well, and synthetic skin patches were positioned over each crystal
in each well. Synthetic skin patches and l-alanine crystals
were exposed to 30 μL of Au NPs (20, 100, or 200 nm). Sample
wells containing a synthetic skin patch, an l-alanine crystal,
and Au NPs were exposed to microwave heating at 5 W every 30 s (up
to 120 s) with a 10 s delay to record images via an optical microscope.
Each experimental trial was repeated in triplicate. Crystals were
observed for percentage change in the surface area, as measured before
and after microwave heating, via a scanning electron microscope and
quantified using ImageJ software. In these experiments, the temperatures
were determined via an infrared thermometer positioned 30 cm above
each sample.

Preparation of a Plastic Pouch Containing
an l-Alanine
Crystal
Polyurethane plastic tubing was cut with a surgical
knife into 1 cm × 2 cm rectangles and heat-sealed with a tabletop
sealer on three sides. After a large l-alanine crystal (∼450
μm in size and weighing 0.1 mg) was placed in each plastic pouch,
the fourth side of each pouch was heat-sealed.

Decrystallization of an l-Alanine Crystal in a Pouch
on an iCrystal Plate with Various Microwave Heating Time Intervals
Using the MAMAD Technique
An l-alanine crystal was
inserted into a 1 × 2 cm plastic pouch made from 2-mil poly tubing.
Au NPs (20 nm) were placed in each pouch containing an l-alanine
crystal, heat-sealed, and examined under an optical microscope before
decrystallization. The plastic pouch containing the l-alanine
crystal was placed on an iCrystal plate and exposed to microwave heating
at 5 or 10 W for 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, or 60 s intervals with a 10 s
delay to measure the pouch temperatures and record the images.

Decrystallization
of an l-Alanine Crystal in a Plastic
Pouch on an iCrystal Plate with Various Volumes of Au NPs and SF without
Synthetic Skin Patches Using the MAMAD Technique
The pouched l-alanine crystal experiments were used to determine the effect
of different volumes of Au NPs and SF on crystals in the presence
of microwave heating for 30 s at 10 W. Different volumes of 20 nm
Au NPs (10, 50, or 100 μL) and bovine SF (10, 50, or 100 μL)
were mixed in each plastic pouch containing an l-alanine
crystal. The plastic pouch containing the l-alanine crystal
was placed in the well of an iCrystal plate and exposed to microwave
heating at 10 W for 30 s with a 10 s delay to measure pouch temperatures
and record images. l-Alanine crystals were observed for change
in the surface area via ImageJ. Experimental trials were repeated
in triplicate.

Decrystallization of an l-Alanine
Crystal in a Pouch
on an iCrystal Plate with Various Sizes of Au NPs under Synthetic
Skin Patches Using the MAMAD Technique
The synthetic skin
patches (∼4.5 mm diameter) were sectioned out via a biopsy
punch, placed in an antialgae solution, and cooled to 2 °C. A
plastic pouch containing an l-alanine crystal and 30 μL
of Au NPs (20, 100, or 200 nm) was placed in the well of an iCrystal
plate and covered with a synthetic skin patch and coverslip before
exposure to microwaves. The synthetic skin patch over a plastic pouch
containing an l-alanine crystal and Au NPs was exposed to
microwave heating at 10 W for 120 s (at 30 s time intervals) with
a 10 s delay to record images via an optical microscope. Each experimental
trial was repeated in triplicate. The crystals were observed for change
in the surface area using a scanning electron microscope and quantified
via ImageJ. The temperature of each plastic pouch and synthetic skin
patch was measured via an infrared thermometer.
