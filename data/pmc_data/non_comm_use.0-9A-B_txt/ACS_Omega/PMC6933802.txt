Building on previous work (J. Phys. Chem. A2017,121, 8154–8166) under
neutral
conditions, we examined the co-oligomerization of CH2O
and pyrrole to form porphryinogen under acidic conditions using density
functional theory (B3LYP//6-311G**). Thermodynamically, we found that
azafulvene intermediates were significantly stabilized under highly
acidic conditions. Kinetically, energy barriers were lowered for C–C
bond formation, discriminating in favor of reactions that lead to
porphyrinogen. However, it was challenging to satisfactorily combine
our thermodynamic and kinetic profiles into a unified free-energy
profile because of difficulties in optimizing transition states of
cationic species involving proton hops. Instead, we used neutral carboxylic
acids as a proxy to study how energy barriers changed. By combining
data from both neutral and acidic conditions, we estimate a free-energy
profile for the initial steps of oligomerization under milder acidic
conditions more relevant to prebiotic chemistry.

Introduction
In a previous computational study, we
constructed a free-energy
map for the co-oligomerization of formaldehyde and pyrrole to form
porphyrinogen,1 as shown in Figure 1. We calculated the thermodynamics
and kinetics of various elementary reaction steps in this system under
baseline conditions at neutral pH in aqueous solution. In that work,
we alluded to a follow-up study of how the thermodynamics and kinetics
might change under acidic conditions. We hereby present the results
of our follow-up study—things turned out to be more complicated
and generating an overall energy profile was not as straightforward.

However, before diving into those details, here is why we are studying
this system: porphyrinogen is an intermediate in a proposed prebiotic
synthesis of porphyrin,2 and our lab is
interested in calculating free-energy profiles of reactions related
to the origin of life—before extant life evolved to synthesize
porphyrins enzymatically. Although porphyrins from unsubstituted pyrrole
are less relevant to prebiotic chemistry, we do not consider these
as we are comparing the present work to our previous study that only
considered unsubstituted pyrrole and did not include oxidation reactions.

Figure 1 Overall
reaction for porphyrinogen formation.

A brief summary of the relevant
experimental work is as follows.
Starting from the simple reactants paraformaldehyde and pyrrole, Hodgson
and Baker reported one of the earliest syntheses of porphyrin;3 their reaction used neat solutions of the reactants
along with metal salts in sealed tubes heated to 84 °C. Fox and
Strasdeit prepared pyrroles by heating amino acids, then added millimolar
concentrations of formaldehyde, and were able to form both porphyrinogens
and porphyrins.4 Nitrite/nitrate oxidants
added to the reaction mixture were likely responsible for the subsequent
oxidation of porphryinogen to porphyrin.5,6 Notably, these
solutions were quite acidic at pH 2. Subsequently, the Lindsey group
synthesized porphyrins at micromolar concentrations of formaldehyde
and close-to-neutral conditions by adding micelles and vesicles to
the reaction mixture.7 For a comprehensive
history of porphyrin synthesis, going back to the initial work by
Rothemund,8,9 we refer you to The Porphyrins.10 Relevant to our present study, these
experiments showed that acidic conditions played a role in increasing
yields of porphyrin synthesis.

In the present study, we generated
a thermodynamic profile for
the co-oligomerization of formaldehyde and pyrrole to form porphryinogen
under highly acidic conditions by adding a proton to all reaction
species. Note that this represents extreme acidic conditions unlikely
to be encountered in prebiotic chemistry, and we explain our strategy
and its limitations in the Results and Discussion section. This approach allowed us to see that the major difference
in the thermodynamic profile, compared to neutral conditions, is the
stabilization of azafulvene intermediates in cationic species. A smaller
effect observed was the thermodynamic stabilization of reactions involving
C–C bond formation and destabilization of reactions involving
C–N bond formation. These effects favor the formation of porphyrinogen
over other side-products.

However, we encountered numerous challenges
optimizing transition
states to generate an analogous kinetic profile for cationic species,
and after little success, we pivoted to an approach utilizing “neutral”
organic acids as catalysts on neutral reactants (without the added
proton). Using formic acid as a catalyst, we found that barriers were
significantly lowered for C–C bond formation en route to porphyrinogen.
Besides determining which reaction steps are acid-catalyzed, our study
also provides a qualitative feel for the relationship between acid
strength and reaction barriers; qualitative because we cannot easily
combine the thermodynamic and kinetic contributions on a single map
because the former represents extreme acidic conditions whereas the
latter utilizes a neutral molecular acid to directly donate and accept
protons. Furthermore, directly comparing the relative free energies
in aqueous solution of cationic versus neutral species is challenging
because of large magnitude differences in solvation free energies.

Although this is a less-satisfying result, we think it valuable
to discuss the challenges in this study, and hope that we (or others)
will find some way to better connect the two in the future. In the
present study, we provide one possible sketch of the initial steps
of formaldehyde and pyrrole reacting to form dipyrrlmethane under
milder acidic conditions more relevant to prebiotic chemistry, which
emphasizes the potential role of transient (cationic) azafulvene intermediate
species, while acknowledging the limits of our approach.

Computational Methods
The protocol discussed below
is similar to our previous work, and
therefore much of the text in this section is reproduced from earlier
work for clarity and reading ease.1,11−13 As we directly compare present calculations under acidic conditions
with previous work under neutral conditions,1 it is essential to maintain the same protocol. All calculations
were carried out using Jaguar 10.014 at
the B3LYP15−18 flavor of density functional theory (DFT) with a 6-311G** basis
set. For stable molecular species (with no negative eigenvalues),
conformers were generated with MacroModel 11.5 using the Merck Molecular
Force Field.19,20 Only structures within 5 kcal/mol
of the lowest energy conformer were included in a restricted torsional
sampling search. If more than 64 conformers were generated, we selected
64 low-energy conformers with a variety of starting structures to
maximize the probability of finding global minima. Transition states
were built individually both in extended forms and more compact structures
with internal hydrogen bonds. Although we made good faith efforts
to use a wide range of starting structures, it is possible to fail
in locating the lowest energy transition state.

The Poisson–Boltzmann
continuum approximation21,22 was used to describe
the effect of water as a solvent applying the
Jaguar defaults: a dielectric constant of 80.4 and a probe radius
of 1.40 Å. The forces on the quantum mechanical solute atoms
because of the solvent can be calculated in the presence of the solvent.
However, as in previous work, the solvation energy was calculated
at the optimized gas-phase geometry because in most cases there is
practically no change between the gas-phase and implicit solvent-optimized
geometries. It is important to note that even though the solvation
energy contribution is to some extent a free-energy correction, it
certainly does not account for all of the free energy. A comparison
of our chosen level of theory, basis set, and implicit solvent scheme,
with other methods can be found in previous work.23 Although water is a reactant in hydration reactions, concentration
corrections are not included in this landscape, the advantages and
disadvantages of which are also discussed in previous work.24

The analytical Hessian was calculated
for each optimized structure,
and the gas-phase energy corrected for zero-point vibrations. Negative
eigenvalues in transition-state calculations were not included in
the zero-point energy (ZPE). The temperature-dependent enthalpy correction
term is straightforward to calculate from statistical mechanics where
we assume that translational and rotational corrections are a constant
times kT, that low-frequency vibrational modes will
generally cancel out when calculating enthalpy differences, and that
the vibrational frequencies do not change appreciably in solution.
The vibrational scaling factor of 0.967 for B3LYP//6-311G** was not
applied because when relative energies are calculated, the difference
to the enthalpy correction becomes negligible within the computational
error.

The corresponding free-energy corrections in solution
are much
less reliable.25−27 Changes in free-energy terms for translation and
rotation are poorly defined in solution, particularly as molecular
size increases. Additional corrections to the free energy for concentration
differentials among species (to obtain the chemical potential) can
be significant, especially if the solubility varies among the different
species in solution. Furthermore, as the reactions being studied are
in solution, the free energy being accounted for comes from two different
sources: thermal corrections and implicit solvent. Neither of these
parameters is easily separable, nor do they constitute all the required
parts of the free energy given our approximations. To estimate the
free energy, we followed the approach of Lau and Deubel28 who assigned the solvation entropy of each species
as half of its gas-phase entropy. Wertz29 and Abraham30 had previously proposed
that upon dissolving in water, molecules lose a constant fraction
(∼0.5) of their entropy. Recent computational studies in other
unrelated systems have come to the same conclusion.31−33

Although
we calculated multiple conformers, only the most stable
conformer (both stable minima and transition states) for each unique
molecular species is reported in our free-energy map. The relative
free energies in our free-energy profiles are calculated with respect
to the reference molecules: formaldehyde, (neutral or protonated)
pyrrole, and water. Assigning these molecules relative free energies
of zero allows us to quickly and easily visualize a map of the energy
landscape for the myriad reactions that can take place. Our free-energy
values, designated G298, include the ZPE,
enthalpic, and entropic corrections to 298 K for reactions in aqueous
solution. The parsing of energies into their various contributions
can be found in the Supporting Information along with the relative free energies shown in our thermodynamic
profiles.

Our protocol was put to the test with a detailed comparison
of
our computational results with NMR measurements for the self-oligomerization
of a 1 M solution of glycolaldehyde.24 Our
calculated equilibrium concentrations of the dominant species in solution
(monomers and dimers) agreed very well with experiment. In addition,
our calculations allowed us to successfully predict the concentrations
of trimers in solution, 2 orders of magnitude lower than the monomers.
Our protocol performs well in calculating the relative free energies
of stable species, typically within 0.5 kcal/mol of experimental results,
or an uncertainty of within a factor of 2.3 in terms of equilibrium
constant ratios.24,34

To optimize transition
states, additional water molecules or organic
acids were explicitly added to the system to find the lowest energy
barrier for proton transfers. For cationic species, our attempts to
find unconstrained transition states were largely unsuccessful, as
will be described in the Results and Discussion section. This led us to a different approach: utilizing “neutral”
organic acid molecules as potential catalysts. These transition states
were much easier to optimize, and had one large negative eigenvalue
corresponding to the reaction coordinate involving bond breaking/forming
and accompanying proton transfer. Whereas these calculated barriers
can be compared to our previous work in the absence of acid,1 they assume the thermodynamic profile of neutral
zero-charge species, and cannot be mapped directly on the thermodynamic
profile generated for protonated species.

Results and Discussion
Thermodynamic Profile: Neutral Conditions
The top half
of Figure 2, a subset
of the free-energy map from our previous work,1 shows the main pathway leading to porphyrinogen formation under
neutral conditions. The relative free energies (ΔGr) are with respect to H2O, CH2O,
and pyrrole (all three assigned a relative free energy of zero). The
five main reaction types are color-coded according to the figure key.
Below are two examples of how the values in Figure 2 are obtained. Detailed energy contributions
for each species can be found in Table S1 of the Supporting Information.

Figure 2 Thermodynamic profiles of porphryinogen
formation.

Example 1: For the addition of CH2O
to the α-position
of pyrrole (1) to form 3, the free-energy
change is G298(3) –
[G298(CH2O) + G298(1)] = −9.0 kcal/mol; this reaction
is exergonic. As CH2O and pyrrole are both reference states,
the relative free energy of 3, ΔGr(3), is −9.0 kcal/mol. Example 2:
the dehydration of 3 to form the azafulvene 5 is endergonic; the change in free energy is [G298(5) + G298(H2O)] – G298(3) = +11.0 kcal/mol; but as water is a reference state and ΔGr(3) = −9.0 kcal/mol, ΔGr(5) = +11.0 – 9.0 = +2.0
kcal/mol, as shown in Figure 2.

A brief summary of the key results are as follows;
for full details,
see our previous work.1 When CH2O is added to pyrrole, addition to the nitrogen (forming 2) is less thermodynamically favorable compared to addition to the
carbon. The α-position (forming 3) is marginally
favored over the β-position (forming 4). Adding
a second pyrrole requires accessing the azafulvene 5.
The dehydration of 3 to form 5 is an endergonic
reaction (Example 2 above). The subsequent reaction of 1 and 5 to form 6 (red arrow) is exergonic
by 21.8 kcal/mol. Alternatively, 3 and 5 can form 6 (purple arrow) while eliminating CH2O; this reaction is less exergonic (by 12.8 kcal/mol). Successive
additions of CH2O and pyrrole eventually lead to porphyrinogen
(15) formation.

Thermodynamic Profile: Highly Acidic Conditions
To
mimic acidic conditions, we added a proton to all species—a
strategy we previously used to study reactions of aldehydes with imidazole.35 However, unlike protonated imidazole with a
pKa of 6.95, protonated pyrrole has a
pKa of −3.8 (based on 1H NMR spectra in 16 M sulfuric acid).36 Thus, the cationic species in our calculations mimic very high or
extreme acidic conditions, unlike the mild acidic conditions more
relevant to prebiotic chemistry. To compare the relative thermodynamic
stability of multiple species, we chose to maintain the same overall
charge across the board because large differences in solvation free
energies between species with different net charge can lead to spurious
comparisons. Although the extreme acidic conditions are artificial,
our approach provides a bird’s eye view of overall profile
differences between cationic species versus neutral species.

The thermodynamic profile of the cationic species is shown in the
bottom half of Figure 2. The method used to calculate relative free energies is similar
to the neutral case, except that protonated pyrrole (1a) is included in the list of reference molecules under acidic conditions.
The most stable form of protonated pyrrole is when the added proton
is in the α-position (1a). The β-protonated
pyrrole (1b) is 4.4 kcal/mol higher in free energy, whereas
addition to the nitrogen (1c) is 15.7 kcal/mol higher,
as shown in Figure 3. Detailed energy contributions for each species are provided in
Table S2 of the Supporting Information.

Figure 3 Relative
free energies of selected protonated species.

Experimentally, the pKa of 1a is −3.8, the pKa of 1b is −5.9, and the pKa of 1c has not been directly measured but estimated
to be approximately
−14.36,37 Using ΔG = −RT ln Ka,
the acid dissociation reaction 1a + H2O →
H3O+ + 1 yields ΔG = −5.2 kcal/mol for Ka = −3.8. Similarly, the reaction 1b + H2O → H3O+ + 1 yields ΔG = −8.0 kcal/mol for Ka = −5.9; and the reaction 1c + H2O
→ H3O+ + 1 yields ΔG = −19.1 kcal/mol for Ka = −14. Based on these numbers, 1a is the most
stable of the protonated pyrroles; 1b would be 2.8 kcal/mol
higher in free energy, whereas 1c would be 13.9 kcal/mol
higher. These are reasonably close to our calculated estimates of
4.4 and 15.7 kcal/mol respectively.

Returning to Figure 2, addition of CH2O to the pyrrole nitrogen (forming 2a) is less thermodynamically
favored under highly acidic
conditions (ΔG = −2.5 kcal/mol) compared
to neutral conditions (ΔG = −4.7 kcal/mol).
In contrast, addition to carbon is more thermodynamically favorable
at both the α (protonated: ΔG = −12.4
kcal/mol; neutral: ΔG = −9.0 kcal/mol)
and β (protonated: ΔG = −10.5
kcal/mol; neutral: ΔG = −8.5 kcal/mol)
positions. The gap between 3a and 4a has
widened to ∼2 kcal/mol under highly acidic conditions, compared
to a gap of 0.5 kcal/mol between 3 and 4 under neutral conditions. As 3a leads to porphyrinogen,
but 2a and 4a do not, we surmise that this
is one thermodynamic contribution favoring product formation under
highly acidic conditions.

In the hydroxymethylpyrroles, the
proton in the α-position
is still favored, as shown in Figure 3. Comparing 2a and 2b, adding
a proton to the α-carbon is more stable than adding to the nitrogen
by 15.6 kcal/mol, very similar to the difference between 1a and 1c. If hydroxymethyl occupies one of the α-positions,
the proton prefers the unsubstituted position (3a over 3b) with a free-energy difference of 6.8 kcal/mol. (A similar
situation is found comparing 6a and 6b;
the free-energy difference is 7.0 kcal/mol.) If hydroxymethyl occupies
the β-position, the proton prefers the α-position adjacent
to the CH2OH moiety (4a over 4b). Our calculations are in agreement with experimental 1H NMR studies showing that “protonation of a 2-alkylpyrrole
occurs at the 5-position, whereas 3-alkyl groups direct protonation
into the neighboring 2-position, as observed in other electrophilic
substitution reactions”.37

The most significant difference in the thermodynamic profile under
highly acidic conditions compared to neutral conditions is the stabilization
of protonated azafulvene relative to α-hydroxymethylpyrrole.
In Figure 2, under
neutral conditions, the dehydration of 3 to 5 is endergonic by 11.0 kcal/mol. This is not surprising because 1 (and by extension 3) is considered aromatic,
with considerable resonance energy stabilization (75% of benzene),37 but the neutral azafulvene 5 is
not. In the protonated case, the analogous dehydration reaction (3a to 5a) is endergonic by only 2.7 kcal/mol.
Unlike their neutral counterparts, 1a and 3a are not aromatic, and therefore there is no equivalent loss of aromaticity.
One might even expect some stabilization as two additional π-electrons
are added to the delocalized system, and in fact, dehydration is favorable
for the dimer (7a to 8a), trimer (10a to 11a), and tetramer (13a to 14a). As dehydration is the only endergonic step on the path
to porphyrinogen under neutral conditions, our calculations suggest
that the effect of adding acid is to significantly favor this step,
and therefore the overall reaction profile, thermodynamically.

The intermediates formed from subsequent additions of pyrrole and
CH2O have slightly lower relative free energies under highly
acidic conditions (compare 6a to 6 and 7a to 7, e.g.) and the overall profile is similar
to neutral conditions. Exceptions are the azafulvene-like species
as mentioned above, and the final product porphyrinogen. 15a has a marginally higher relative free energy than 15 because the added proton has no choice but to be located on an α-carbon
thus reducing resonance stabilization.

To summarize, a bird’s
eye view of the thermodynamic profiles
under neutral versus highly acidic conditions show overall broad similarities,
as seen by comparing the relative free energies in Figure 2. There are two notable differences:
(1) the significant stabilization of azafulvene-like species when
a proton is added to the system and (2) increased discrimination favoring
CH2O addition in the α-position. Both these effects
favor porphyrinogen formation. The caveat: the extreme acidic conditions
modeled by adding a proton to all species is unrealistic. The thermodynamic
profile under more relevant milder acidic conditions might be extrapolated
to lie in between the two profiles we have generated in Figure 2. We will return to this matter
after discussing the issues we encountered exploring the kinetics
of this system.

Kinetics under Acidic Conditions
Our attempts to find
optimal transition states of cationic species (overall +1 charge)
under highly acidic conditions were largely unsuccessful. We were
only able to cleanly optimize one unconstrained transition state structure
(Figure S1)—the direct addition
of 1 and 5a to form 6a (red
arrow in Figure 2).
The forming C–C bond is 2.32 Å and the activation barrier
is 8.1 kcal/mol. For comparison, the analogous reaction under neutral
conditions is 14.7 kcal/mol from our previous work.1 We optimized two unconstrained transition states (Figure S2) for the dehydration reaction forming 5a, but neither transition state had the appropriate eigenvectors
along the reaction coordinate. In one case, the proton hops from one
α-carbon to the other; the C–H bond is partially breaking,
but the C–O bond remains fully intact. In the other case, the
proton has completely hopped off the pyrrole although the breaking
C–O bond distance is at a reasonable 1.89 Å. Energies
for all three transition states are in Table S2.

We were unable to find reasonable unconstrained transition
states for any of the CH2O addition reactions forming 2a, 3a, or 4a. In most cases, the
proton hops off (through a chain of water molecules transfers) to
the incoming CH2O, forming the CH2OH moiety
which is essentially the product structure. In some cases, the CH2OH moiety and its “water cluster” separate from
the pyrrole. We attempted several constrained optimizations moving
stepwise along (what seemed to us) desirable reaction coordinates,
but the barriers were unrealistically high and no smooth “curve”
joining reactant to product along the reaction coordinate could be
found. Releasing the constraints led to reactant or product complexes.
We were similarly unsuccessful in our attempts to find the transition
state for dimerization with CH2O elimination, that is,
the reaction of 3a and 5a to form 6a.

Given these difficulties, we pivoted to a different
strategy—using
an organic acid as a proxy acid catalyst of the reaction types studied.
We are not the first to employ this approach; for example, it was
used to compare acetaldehyde hydration in the gas phase, in neutral
aqueous solution, and in the presence of a carboxylic acid.38 With this new strategy, optimizing unconstrained
transition states was now straightforward, but introduced other complications—we
discuss these below as we present the results.

Instead of calculating
reaction barriers for every reaction in Figure 2, we chose to study
representative reactions: addition of CH2O to pyrrole,
dehydration to azafulvene, and addition of the second pyrrole. These
reactions are shown in Figure 4; detailed energy contributions of each transition state are
found in Table S3 of the Supporting Information. We initially chose formic acid as the proxy acid catalyst because
it is considered an origin-of-life building block,39 and is a catalyst for studying prebiotic chemistry in hydrothermal
vents40 and the RNA world.41 It is also a major product in early Miller–Urey
spark discharge experiments.42 In Figure 4, the energy barriers
for formic acid are in green font. The suffix fa indicates
that the catalyst is formic acid, and the prefix TSX designates
the transition state forming product X. Parenthetical
values in blue font are the energy barriers under neutral (aqueous)
conditions from our previous work.1

Figure 4 Representative
acid-catalyzed reactions. Energy barriers are in
kcal/mol.

We considered addition of CH2O to three
pyrrole positions
(nitrogen, α-carbon, β-carbon) in the presence of formic
acid. In Figure 4,
comparing the energy barriers where formic acid (green) facilitates
proton transfer rather than solely relying on water molecules (blue),
we find the following. There is practically no difference for CH2O addition to the nitrogen (TS2fa). However,
there is significant stabilization for CH2O addition to
the α (TS3fa) or β (TS4fa) position
by ∼10 kcal/mol. Notably, addition to the α-carbon has
a lower barrier (+13.1 kcal/mol) compared to the nitrogen (+16.9 kcal/mol)
in the presence of formic acid. When only water was present, the opposite
was true: adding to the nitrogen was kinetically more favorable (+16.7
kcal/mol instead of +22.8 kcal/mol to the α-carbon).

The
dehydration of 3 to 5 has a marginally
higher barrier with formic acid (+15.1 kcal/mol) compared to water
(+13.8 kcal/mol). In contrast, the C–C bond-forming dimerization
reactions both have lower barriers with formic acid. The direct addition
of 1 and 5 to form 6 has a
barrier of +9.0 kcal/mol in formic acid compared to +14.7 kcal/mol
in water. The addition of 3 and 5 to form 6, while simultaneously eliminating CH2O, has a
barrier of +7.3 kcal/mol in formic acid compared to +10.9 kcal/mol
in water. Interestingly, the barrier of 8.1 kcal/mol in the one case
(addition of 1 and 5a) where we successfully
optimized a protonated transition state is close to the 9.0 kcal/mol
barrier with formic acid, but this may be coincidental.

From
these results, we conclude that the role of acid in the kinetic
profile is to lower the barriers for C–C bond formation when
CH2O and pyrrole moieties are added along the co-oligomerization
pathway to form porphyrinogen. On the other hand, acid does not aid
the dehydration reaction or the formation of new C–N bonds.

Can we relate this to the thermodynamic profile? In the previous
section, we saw that adding a proton to the system slightly stabilized
C–C bond formation products by 2–3 kcal/mol, whereas
the main effect was to significantly stabilize the azafulvene intermediates
formed via dehydration (by 8–10 kcal/mol). However, adding
a proton in the thermodynamic profile mimics extreme acid conditions,
whereas it is less clear what conditions are mimicked in the kinetic
profile by using molecular formic acid as a proxy for proton transfer
in the transition state. To further examine how our calculations might
simulate varying acidic conditions, we completed similar transition-state
optimizations with acetic acid (aa), fluoroacetic acid
(faa), and trifluoroacetic acid (tfaa).
The pKa values for these three acids are
4.75, 2.59, and 0.23 respectively; whereas the pKa of formic acid is 3.75.

Unfortunately, the picture
becomes more complicated. In Figure 4, if we consider
only the energy barriers with acetic acid and its fluoro-substituents,
we see that barriers decrease in all three cases with increasing acidity.
Compared to aa, the faa and tfaa barriers are lower by 3–5 and 7–9 kcal/mol respectively.
This seems to qualitatively fit well with the decrease in pKa values. However, the formic acid (fa) barriers are very similar to faa, and quite different
from aa, even though the pKa of fa is almost midway between faa and aa. Is formic acid an outlier?

The transition states
for several of the fa-catalyzed
reactions are shown in Figure 5; analogous structures for aa shown in the Supporting Information look very similar. Nothing
seems amiss, and the bond-forming and bond-breaking transition-state
distances are typical. For CH2O addition, the forming N–C
or C–C bonds are ∼1.8 Å. For dehydration, the breaking
C–O bond is ∼2.1 Å. For the dimerization reactions,
the forming C–C bond is ∼2.1 Å with fa (and 2.4 Å with aa) in the direct addition of 1 and 5, similar to the direction addition of 1 and 5a discussed earlier. As expected, the
acidic proton is further away from the carboxylate “catalyst”
and closer to the formaldehyde–pyrrole oligomers. The analogous
optimized transition-state structures for the other acids look very
similar; and formic acid does not look like an outlier structurally.

Figure 5 Transition-state
structures with formic acid catalyst.

Another puzzle is that the barriers for acetic
acid in two cases
are noticeably higher than for the water-only case. These two cases,
CH2O addition to the pyrrole nitrogen (TS2aa) and dehydration (TS5aa), are the ones where our initial
calculations with formic acid suggested no lowering of the energy
barriers. It seems odd that acetic acid is “worse” at
proton transfer than employing a chain of only water molecules. If
we add an additional water molecule to the TS2aa transition
state, it can be placed either in between acetic acid and pyrrole,
or between acetic acid and formaldehyde (see Figure S3 in the Supporting Information). The former has a barrier
of +21.6 kcal/mol, that is, adding the water makes no difference;
but the latter has a barrier of +15.6 kcal/mol, much closer to the
water-only barrier of +16.7 kcal/mol (although marginally lower and
within the computational error). However, using the same strategy
with the fluoro-substituted acids showed no decrease in the barrier.
After attempting to optimize multiple transition states with additional
interposed water molecules for several reactions, and finding no consistency,
we decided to stick with having only the carboxylic acid as the proton
shuttle—this at least allows us to systematically cross-compare
the energy barriers using proxy acids, and these are the numbers shown
in Figure 4.

A reviewer suggested trying newer DFT functionals to ascertain
if any of the problems we were encountering was an artifact of B3LYP,
but we ran into the same issues, and the results were less satisfactory;
the results and accompanying discussion can be found in the Supporting Information.

Perhaps a lesson
here is that one should be cautious when using
a molecular acid as a proxy catalyst to mimic the environmental conditions
with a target pH, and that using a series of acids to mimic different
pH conditions may result in unexpected computational artifacts. Although
a clear trend of lower barrier with lower pKa is observed comparing acetic acid, fluoroacetic acid, and
trifluoroacetic acid, it is less clear if formic acid can be mapped
on the same scale as the other three. There are many approximations
leading to our free-energy values. The entropic approximation that
worked well in our previous work when only water molecules were added
to a transition state may introduce significant errors, as might the
implicit solvent approximation, and in future work we plan to study
this in a simpler system with clear experimental data over a range
of pH values.

In the meantime, although the results do not fit
into a tidy package,
we can at least summarize our main findings, focusing on formic acid
as the prebiotically plausible proxy for acid catalysis. We find that
the most significant kinetic effect is lowering the barrier for CH2O addition to pyrrole to form a new C–C bond. Although
addition to both the α and β positions is more facile,
α remains kinetically favored over β by ∼4 kcal/mol.
Pyrrole addition to the azafulvene intermediate, also a C–C
bond-forming reaction, is also kinetically favored in the presence
of formic acid. On the other hand, for CH2O addition to
the pyrrole nitrogen (forming a C–N bond) and for the dehydration
reaction, the barriers are similar for both formic acid and water.
Thus, the key C–C bond-forming reactions en route to porphyrinogen
formation are catalyzed by formic acid. The picture is less clear
when comparing different carboxylic acids.

It is also unclear
if the kinetic profile can be directly combined
with the thermodynamic profile given the different approach used to
mimic (different) acidic conditions. One possibility is to combine
the barriers for the strongest molecular acid in our study, trifluoroacetic
acid, with the “highly acidic” thermodynamic profile.
However, given that 1a (pKa −3.8) is still much more acidic than tfaa, it
is unclear if this is a reasonable match-up. Furthermore, it is weak
acid conditions that are relevant to prebiotic chemistry and the motivation
for this study. Thus, we will explore one possible way of extracting
data from our seemingly disparate thermodynamic and kinetic studies,
to shed some light on the role of acid under plausibly prebiotic conditions;
to this we now turn.

Combining Thermodynamics and Kinetics: A Free-Energy Profile
One way to combine the data in both parts of Figure 2 on the same scale is to peg the relative
free energy of 1a to be +5.2 kcal/mol above 1, given the −3.8 pKa value of 1a as previously discussed. This is shown in Figure 6 for the initial reaction steps
leading to the formation of dipyrrlmethane (6). The relative
free energies of the relevant neutral molecules (1, 3, 5, 6) are represented with thick
black bars, whereas the thick red bars refer to cationic species: 1a is pegged at +5.2 kcal/mol, and the free energies of all
other cations that might possibly be involved (from Figure 3) can be referenced to 1a. Structures of all these species are also included in Figure 6 for clarity.

Figure 6 Example of
a combined energy profile with weak-acid catalysis.

Thin horizontal lines indicate transition states:
blue for water,
green for formic acid. (We chose formic acid because of its prebiotically
plausibility as previously discussed.) The relative free energies
(Table S3, Supporting Information) are
already pegged to 1 as the transition states are overall
neutral. Note that the barriers in Figure 4 are for specific reactions, whereas the
values in Figure 6 are
all relative to 1. Thus, for the first step these are
identical (+22.8 kcal/mol and +13.1 kcal/mol for water and formic
acid, respectively). However, for the dehydration step, as 3 has a relative free energy of −9.0 kcal/mol and the calculated
barriers are +13.8 and +15.1 kcal/mol for water and formic acid, respectively
(see Figure 4), the
relative free energies of TS5wat and TS5fa are +4.8 and +6.1 kcal/mol, respectively, in Figure 6.

Blue diagonal lines connect the water-only
transition states to
the neutral molecules. This represents the uncatalyzed pathway: 1 → TS3wat → 3 → TS5wat → 5 → TS6wat → 6. We expect that azafulvene 5 will not be easily observed as the reverse barrier of 5 hydrating back to 3 is tiny (+2.8 kcal/mol). This pathway
has already been extensively discussed in our previous work under
neutral conditions.1

Green diagonal
lines connect the formic acid transition states
with both the neutral molecules and potential protonated intermediates,
most of which are likely to be transient and unobservable. The acid-catalyzed
barrier (+13.1 kcal/mol) for CH2O addition is significantly
lowered compared to water-only. The transition state (TS3fa in Figure 5) is structurally
close to a complex of (the Wheland intermediate) 3b and
formate. As previously discussed, 3a is more stable than 3b, an easy proton-hop away; and in either case subsequent
removal of the proton leads to 3; black dashed lines
indicate the connection 3b → 3a → 3. It is highly unlikely that 3a or 3b can be isolated experimentally, although 3b may be
a very transient intermediate. By repositioning the formate, we can
optimize the transition state TSpt3fa (pt for proton transfer, structure shown in Supporting Information) to pull the proton off the α-carbon. TSpt3fa is slightly lower in energy than TS3fa; however, given the instability of 3b relative to 3, the proton can simply be removed by solvent.

In the
dehydration step, TS5fa is calculated to be
slightly higher in free energy than TS5wat. In Figure 5, the transition
state of TS5fa resembles a complex of the structure 3d (in Figure 6) and formate. However, in our calculations, adding a proton to the
oxygen in 3 to form 3d automatically results
in water moving away. We were able to optimize an unconstrained state
with a C···O distance of 2.6 Å (at relative free
energy −0.7 kcal/mol) indicated by the dashed C–O line
in 3d, but there is practically no barrier to push the
water molecule further away to form separate 5a and water
moieties; hence, 3d is unlikely to be experimentally
observed as an intermediate.

Azafulvene 5a is the
only case where the corresponding
protonated species is lower in relative free energy than its neutral
counterpart (5). However, 5a is still thermodynamically
less stable than 3 and the low hydration barrier suggests
that, if present, 5a is transient and would be difficult
to observe experimentally. As TS5wat is marginally lower
in energy than TS5fa, it could operate as the transition
state connecting 3 to 5a (blue dashed line)
even in acidic conditions.

Adding pyrrole to azafulvene, TS6fa is 5.7 kcal/mol
lower in free energy than TS6wat, suggesting that this
step is acid-catalyzed. Similar to the CH2O addition step, TS6fa resembles a transition state involving 6b and formate (see Figure 5). A proton hop might lead to the lower energy 6a (with an energy gap similar to 3b and 3a), but abstracting the proton (TS6tfa) is also a low-barrier
reaction, and either pathway leads to the neutral dipyrrlmethane 6. We expect 6b and 6a to be difficult
to observe even if they represent intermediates along the reaction
pathway.

Throughout this section, our language has been tentative.
Our scheme
in Figure 6 may not
be the best way to combine the thermodynamics and kinetics; using
molecular formic acid as the proxy catalyst representative of weakly
acidic conditions is a significant assumption; and pegging the relative
free energies of protonated species to their neutral counterparts
essentially by a 5.2 kcal/mol “correction” factor might
be erroneous. In weak acid, the free energies of local minima are
likely to lie in between the neutral and protonated states, although
closer to the neutral. Our scheme does highlight that thermodynamic
stabilization of azafulvene (although transient as an intermediate)
may be important in the acid-catalyzed reaction. We are embarking
on future work to test this scheme in a more tractable system with
good experimental data.

Conclusions
The present work explores the co-oligomerization
of CH2O and pyrrole to form porphyrinogen under acidic
conditions compared
to neutral conditions in aqueous solution at 25 °C. We can summarize
our results as follows. Azafulvene intermediates, less stable under
neutral conditions, are significantly stabilized thermodynamically
under acidic conditions. Kinetically, the presence of (formic) acid
lowers barriers for C–C bond formation as successive CH2O and pyrrole monomers are added to the growing oligopyrrole.
Acidic conditions also favor addition of CH2O to the α-carbon
of pyrrole both thermodynamically and kinetically, thus favoring the
formation of intermediates en route to porphyrinogen, compared to
side reactions leading to other products.

It was challenging
to connect our thermodynamic profile with our
kinetic (barrier) estimates because of the different methodologies
employed. Adding a proton mimics unrealistic extreme acidic conditions,
but provides consistency when comparing the free energies of species
within the thermodynamic profile of cationic species. The difficulty
in locating transition states led us to use neutral carboxylic acids
as proxy catalysts, although this brought up other complications.
We generated one example of a unified free-energy map, to provide
some sense of the effect of a weak acid on this system, but it rests
on less secure assumptions. Future work will explore other approaches
to the problem, and we hope to generate a scheme allowing finer discrimination
of thermodynamic and kinetic effects as a function of pH in aqueous
solution.
