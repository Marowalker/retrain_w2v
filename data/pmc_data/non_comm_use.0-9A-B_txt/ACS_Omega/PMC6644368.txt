The total synthesis
of (±)-allocolchicine has been completed
by employing cobalt-catalyzed alkyne [2 + 2 + 2]-cyclotrimerization
as the key reaction. The essential diyne has been synthesized from
easily available 3,4,5-trimethoxybenzaldehyde following simple chemical
transformations. In general, the cycloaddition gave a mixture of C(9)
and C(10) isomers thus allowing the synthesis of both allocolchicine
and its C(10)-carboxylate. Because this cycloaddition was employed
at the penultimate stage, it allowed the synthesis of various analogues
having the diverse functionality at C(9) and/or C(10) of ring C.

Introduction
In 1820, colchicine
was first isolated by Pelletier and Caventou
from the meadow saffron Colchicum autumnale.1 Colchicine is the first and most studied
drug against acute gout and familial Mediterranean fever, where it
arrests the formation of the mitotic spindle in the cell by binding
with microtubules thus resulting in microtubule depolymerization.2 Along with this, it is useful in the treatment
of chronic myelocytic leukemia and other types of cancers.3 Unfortunately, its toxicity has caused limitation
in the treatment of human neoplasm and has proved ineffective in therapeutic
studies.4 It was observed that the prominent
activity of colchicine primarily depends on the size of ring C and
substituents present on ring C.5 Later,
compounds having modifications of ring C, such as natural allocolchicine
(1) and allied allocolchicinoids, like methyl ester of N-acetyl colchicinol (NSC 51046), N-acetylcolchicinol,
and its dihydrogenphosphate (ZD 6126), possessing a 6–7–6
carbocyclic framework, showed good activity with reduced toxicity
compared to that of the 6–7–7 tricylic system present
in colchicine (Figure 1).3,6 This reduced toxicity and the structural features
have led to an interest in the development of synthetic protocols
to enable allocolchicine (1) and its analogues as promising
tubulin-binding agents. In this context, developments of modular synthetic
approaches that provide an easy access to a variety of ring C-modified
allocolchicinoids are highly desirable.

Figure 1 Colchicine, allocolchicine,
and related pharmaceutically important
allocolchicinoids.

Interestingly, till date,
there is only one report on the total
synthesis of allocolchicine (1) by Wulff’s group
and one formal synthesis report by Fagnou’s group. Wulff and
co-workers used a Diels–Alder reaction for C ring construction.7 On the other hand, Fagnou’s group documented
the Pd-catalyzed intramolecular direct arylation to install the B
ring of allocolchicine.8 Coming to the
other allocolchicinoids that are currently in clinical trials, Maudet’s9 report on the synthesis of N-acetylcolchicinol using
modified Ziegler Ullmann coupling, Hanna’s10 enyne ring-closing metathesis (RCM) and Diels–Alder
aromatization for B and C ring construction, synthesis of NSC 51046
by Green’s11 group employing an
intramolecular Nicholas reaction for B ring construction, as well
as synthesis of NSC 51046 by DeShong’s12 group employing the siloxane coupling-ring expansion protocol are
the remarkable examples in this regard. Moreover, Norman’s
group developed an approach for the synthesis of 6-oxa-allocolchicinoids
by [2 + 2 + 2]-cycloaddition as well as synthesized various allocolchicine
analogues with pyridine C ring through intermolecular Vollhardt diyne-nitrile
cyclotrimerization in another report.13 We have recently documented the synthesis of a library focused on
the cyclopropyl allocolchicinoids that have shown equipotent tubulin-binding
ability when compared to the natural allocolchicine (1).14 A large number of C ring-modified
analogues of this cyclopropyl allocolchicinoids could be realized
by virtue of using the alkyne [2 + 2 + 2]-cyclotrimerization15,16 as the key reaction and importantly as the final event in our adopted
approach. Given its simplicity and realization of a large number of
analogues, especially with substituent alteration on ring C, we realized
that adopting a similar cyclotrimerization approach will address the
total synthesis of allocolchicine as well as the synthesis of ring
C-modified allocolchicinoids. In this article, we document the successful
total synthesis of (±)-allocolchicine (1) employing
Co-catalyzed alkyne [2 + 2 + 2]-cyclotrimerization for the simultaneous
construction of rings B and C and the synthesis of several ring-modified
allocolchicinoids.17

Results and Discussion
Our retrosynthetic disconnections for (±)-allocolchicine (1) are summarized in Scheme 1. Keeping the alkyne [2 + 2 + 2]-cyclotrimerization
reaction as the key reaction, the simultaneous disconnection of the
rings B and C led to the identification of diyne 2 as
the key intermediate. PMB protection of the N–Ac group could
avoid any complications associated with the free amide during the
cyclotrimerization. An SN2 displacement of the corresponding
propargyl chloride 3 with PMB-amine has been planned
to introduce the amine functional group. The synthesis of propargyl
chloride 3 was intended from commercially available 3,4,5-trimethoxybenzaldehyde
by the Grignard reaction for side-chain elongation, followed by Sonogashira
coupling to introduce the aryl alkyne unit, followed by the sequence
of proline-catalyzed α-chlorination on the side chain, and the
subsequent Ohira–Bestmann alkynylation reaction.

Scheme 1 Retrosynthetic
Analysis of (±)-Allocolchicine (1)
The synthesis commenced with the Grignard addition
of but-3-enylmagnesium
bromide to 3,4,5-trimethoxybenzaldehyde and subsequent deoxygenation
of the resulting benzyl alcohol 4 in the presence of
Et2O·BF3 and Et3SiH to afford 5 in excellent yields (Scheme 2). Initially, the introduction of the alkyne unit on 5 was attempted by following a sequence of formylation and
Ohira–Bestmann alkynylation reactions. The formylation of 5 proceeded smoothly by using dichloromethylmethyl ether in
the presence of TMSOTf to afford aldehyde 6 in admirable
yield. Strangely, the attempts for alkynylation of 6 either
by the Ohira–Bestmann reagent18 or
by the Corey–Fuchs reaction19 were
unsuccessful, probably due to the steric hindrance. This led us to
opt for an alternative route for the preparation of 3, where we intended to employ Sonogashira cross-coupling at an elevated
temperature to introduce the alkyne unit opted for previous synthesis.14

Scheme 2 Preparation of the Building Block Propargyl
Chloride 3
Accordingly, 5 was first subjected for oxidative
cleavage
by using KMnO4 and NaIO4 to get aldehyde, which
was carried further for reduction to get alcohol and then protection
of the resulting free −OH as its acetate to obtain 7 in 70% yield over four steps (Scheme 3). The iodination of 7 with I2/Ag(CF3CO2) in CHCl3 gave the requisite
iodo compound 8 with 94% yield. The intended Sonogashira
coupling of 8 with trimethylsilylacetylene proceeded
smoothly in the presence of PdCl2(PPh3)2 (2 mol %), copper iodide (20 mol %), and PPh3 (20
mol %) in DMF/diethyl amine (1:2) at 80 °C and provided the required
coupling product 9 in 86% yield. Following this, one-pot
alkynyl–TMS as well as acetate group deprotection using K2CO3 in methanol gave the desired alkynol 10. The oxidation of alkynol 10 proceeded smoothly
with Dess–Martin periodinane (DMP)20 in CH2Cl2 to provide the aldehyde intermediate.
Our next concern was the α-chlorination of an aldehyde and installation
of the second alkyne unit. The treatment of this aldehyde with N-chlorosuccinimide (NCS) in the presence of l-proline
in acetonitrile followed by the subjection of the resulting α-chloroaldehyde
immediately for alkynylation using the Ohira–Bestmann reagent
and K2CO3 in methanol provided the diyne 3 with 45% yield over three steps.

Scheme 3 Total Synthesis of
(±)-Allocolchicine (1) and Its
C(10) Regioisomer 1a
At this point, we had the cyclization precursor diyne 3, the building block for the key cyclotrimerization reaction.
With
this, we began our efforts for the installation of the amine functionality
at the C(7) center. To achieve this, we sought to explore the possibility
of the nucleophilic substitution of chlorine by the amination reagent.
The displacement of the chloro group in diyne 3 was carried
out with p-methoxybenzyl amine in the presence of
Cs2CO3 in CH3CN to obtain the diyne 11 in moderate yield. Subsequent acetyl protection with acetic
anhydride gave the key intermediate diyne 2 (Scheme 3). With the fully
elaborated diyne 2 having the required basic arrangement
of all components, we proceeded toward the construction of the aromatic
ring of allocolchicine (1) using the intended [Co]-mediated
cyclotrimerization reaction.21 After optimization
of the reaction, the cyclotrimerization of diyne 2 with
methyl propiolate was realized successfully in the presence of 20
mol % CpCo(CO)2 catalyst under light (200 W bulb) in toluene
and resulted in an inseparable mixture of regioisomers, which were
consequently subjected to PMB deprotection by using trifluoroacetic
acid/CH2Cl2 (2:1) to afford easily separable
(±)-allocolchicine (1) and its C(10) regioisomer 1a in 1:2 proportion in 79% combined yield over two steps.
Both (±)-allocolchicine (1) and its C(10) regioisomer 1a were characterized by 1H and 13C
NMR, and the spectral data matched entirely with earlier reports.7,10b

Having synthesized target allocolchicine (1)
and established
the feasibility of the cobalt-catalyzed alkyne [2 + 2 + 2]-cyclotrimerization
reaction, we turned our attention to the synthesis of its analogues
having variations at C(9) and C(10) of ring C. Table 1 shows the scope of the Co-catalyzed alkyne
[2 + 2 + 2]-cyclotrimerization reaction of diyne 2 with
easily available symmetric as well as asymmetric alkynes. With acetylene,
the cyclotrimerization reaction proceeded effectively in a sealed
tube to afford 1b in 77% yield. However, the reaction
with bis(trimethylsilyl)acetylene did not provide the desired product.
Similarly, the reaction was carried out with symmetric alkynes like
dimethyl acetylenedicarboxylate, 4-octyne, and the diacetate of butyne
diol and provided the corresponding allocolchicinoids in good yields.
In the case of asymmetric alkynes, the cyclotrimerization resulted
in inseparable regioisomeric mixtures, but the regioisomers were easily
separated by column chromatography after PMB deprotection and were
characterized by two-dimensional NMR spectroscopy. In the reaction
of diyne 2 with methyl 3-phenylpropiolate, the major
regioisomer 1h was observed in 62% yield, whereas the
minor regioisomer could not be isolated. These numbers of analogues
having different functionality at the C ring show the importance and
flexibility of our synthetic strategy (Table 1).

Table 1 Scope of the [2 +
2 + 2]-Cyclotrimerization
of Diyne 2 and Various Alkynes
The NMR spectra of allocolchicine and other analogues
revealed
that these compounds exist as an equilibrium mixture of two atropisomers.
It has been reported earlier that in the case of colchicine and other
colchicinoids, the conformational equilibrium is solvent-dependent
and also depends on the nature of the substituents present on ring
B.6c,7,22 It has been seen that
deacetamidocolchicine, in which C(7) is a methylene, exists in solution
as a 1:1 mixture of both the atropisomers.23 However, when colchicine’s seven-member tropolone ring is
replaced with an aromatic phenyl ring, as in allocolchicinoids, the
structural features controlling the equilibrium of atropisomers are
less clear. In this regard, few groups have studied conformational
equilibria of modified allocolchicinoids in various solvents.3,7 However, a detailed study of the atropisomerism of allocolchicine
(1) has not been revealed yet. To probe in this direction,
the 1H NMR of allocolchicine (1) and its regioisomer 1a has been recorded in different solvents. As shown in Table 2, in nonpolar solvents
like chloroform-d1, dichloromethane-d2, and benzene-d6, the atropisomer mixture was observed in varying proportions. In
polar solvents, like acetone-d6, methanol-d4, and pyridine-d5, only a single atropisomer was observed with both 1 and 1a. This study indicated clearly a solvent-dependent
conformational equilibrium in the case of allocolchicine (1) and its isomer 1a. Also, the comparison of variation
of this ratio in 1 and 1a revealed that
the substituent position on the ring C has some nominal effect on
the ratio of the conformational isomers. The observed large coupling
constants, J6,7 = 12.2 Hz and J6′,7 = 6.7 Hz for H-C(7) of 1 and J6,7 = 12.2 Hz and J6′,7 = 7.2 Hz for H-C(7) of 1a, revealed their conformers as (aS,7S);(aR,7R) in methanol-d4 solvent (Figure 2).22

Conclusions
In summary, the total synthesis of (±)-allocolchicine has
been completed by employing simple starting compounds and Co-catalyzed
alkyne [2 + 2 + 2]-cyclotrimerization to construct the central 6–7–6
tricyclic framework. To demonstrate the flexibility of our approach,
a good number of ring C-modified allocolchicinoids with varying substituents
at C(9) and/or C(10) have been synthesized. The effects of various
solvents on the atropisomerism present in allocolchicinoids were studied
in detail. Currently, work in the direction of asymmetric synthesis
of allocolchicine and the accessing of various C-ring-modified allocolchicine
analogues and their screening for tubulin-binding affinity and as
antimitotic agents are in progress, and the results will be reported
in due course.

Experimental Section
General Information
Air- and/or moisture-sensitive
reactions were carried out in anhydrous solvents under an atmosphere
of argon in oven-dried glassware. All anhydrous solvents were distilled
prior to use: CH2Cl2, toluene, and DMF from
CaH2; methanol from Mg cake; tetrahydrofuran (THF) on Na/benzophenone;
and acetonitrile over P2O5. Commercial reagents
were used without purification. Column chromatography was carried
out by using silica gel (60–120, 100–200, and 230–400
mesh). 1H NMR and 13C NMR chemical shifts are
reported in ppm relative to chloroform-d (δ
= 7.25) or TMS, and coupling constants (J) are reported
in hertz (Hz). The following abbreviations have been used to designate
signal multiplicity: s = singlet, d = doublet, t = triplet, q = quartet,
m = multiplet, and b = broad. The multiplicity of carbons has been
assigned with the help of DEPT spectra. High resolution mass spectra
(HRMS) were recorded on a Q Exactive Hybrid Quadrupole Orbitrap Mass
Spectrometer, where the mass analyzer used for analysis is orbitrap.

General Procedure for Alkyne
[2 + 2 + 2]-Cyclotrimerization
The diyne 2 (1
equiv) and alkyne (2.5 equiv) were
placed in a screw-capped pressure tube and dissolved in anhydrous
toluene (2 mL), which was then evacuated and back-filled with argon.
To the reaction vessel, CpCo(CO)2 (20 mol %) was added.
The solution was then stirred under light (200 W) until consumption
of the starting material. The reaction mixture was cooled to room
temperature and the crude filtered through Celite pad and concentrated,
and the crude product was subjected to N-PMB group
deprotection. A solution of the above crude product in CH2Cl2/trifluoroacetic acid (1:2, 6 mL) was stirred at room
temperature until the complete disappearance of the starting compound,
as indicated by TLC. After completion, the solvent was evaporated
under reduced pressure and the residue was subjected to silica gel
column chromatography (230–400 mesh) to afford the corresponding
cyclotrimerization product.

(±)-Allocolchicine (1)
The reaction
of diyne 2 (30 mg, 0.069 mmol) with methyl propiolate
