Because
of a wide range of applications of porous carbon platelets
(PCPs), a robust method for their facile synthesis/fabrication with
controlled porous structure, size, and shape is constantly needed.
Herein, we report a simple and scalable method for producing PCPs
with uniform size and arbitrarily designed shapes. This approach relies
on CO2 laser irradiation to induce carbonization of a biomass
composite sheet formed by the infusion of sodium lignosulfonate into
a cellulose paper to create porous carbon features with arbitrarily
designed shapes. Upon subsequent water immersion treatment, the laser-written
carbon features could spontaneously detach to form freestanding PCPs.
The PCPs of different shapes were fabricated, characterized, and demonstrated
for their potential applications in dye adsorption, as flexible sensors,
and as miniaturized supercapacitors. Our method is expected to make
great impacts in multiple fields, such as environment, energy storage,
sensing, catalysis, and so forth.

1 Introduction
Porous
carbon platelets (PCPs) with tailored size, shape, and porosity
structure1−6 possess a set of highly desired properties, for example, high surface
area, thermal and mechanical stability, tailorable electrical/electronic
properties, ease for physical and chemical functionalization, and
low density. This enables them to be useful for a variety of promising
applications, such as electrodes in electrical energy storage,7−10 active and passive substrates for catalyst support,11−14 drug delivery or cell transport,15,16 adsorbent
materials for dye and contaminant removal in water treatment,17 hydrogen storage and CO2 adsorption,18,19 electromagnetic wave-absorbing materials,20,21 and being used as the building blocks for preparing novel complex
structured metal–organic framework composites.22

The traditional methods used for producing porous
carbon materials
typically include chemical and physical activation of existing carbon
materials, catalytic activation of carbon precursors, carbonization
of a polymer blend with the presence of both carbonizable and pyrolyzable
components, and pyrolysis of organic aerogels, defluorination of fluorine
containing polymers, and chlorination of metal carbides.5,23−30 In terms of precise control of the size, shape, and pore structure
of the PCPs, the newly emerging templating method and its variants1−3 have rivaled the traditional approaches and received great attention
in recent years. The currently developed various templating methods,
both hard7,8,10,31−41 and soft templating approaches,42−45 typically involve tedious multistep
processes including ex situ or in situ template creation and then
their subsequent removal. To overcome such a disadvantage, a few researchers12,46−49 discovered some template-free methods for producing PCPs by wisely
selecting combinations of carbon precursors, solvents, catalysts,
and carbonization methods. These template-free methods greatly simplified
the PCP production process, though with some shortcomings such as
the lack of versatility and generality in shape-control of the finally
formed PCPs.1 In addition to the aforementioned
disadvantages, the previously developed templating and template-free
methods face a great challenge. That is, beyond the commonly achieved
spherical or hollow spherical forms, these previous methods have difficulties
to produce PCPs of complex shapes. Herein, we report a direct laser
writing (DLW)-assisted method for template-free producing PCPs with
arbitrarily designed shapes. The DLW technique is a recently emerged
method for easy creation of patterned porous carbon materials on the
surface of a precursor polymer substrate.50−53 This method has been successfully
demonstrated for fabricating a variety of useful devices including
a flexible all-solid supercapacitor,54 piezoresistive
sensor,55−57 force and humidity dual sensor,58 pH sensor,59 water quality-monitoring
sensor,60 3D insulator–conductor
composites,61 heating elements,62 and so forth. The flexibility and versatility
of the DLW method make this technique a promising tool that allows
for integrating the design and control of material structures with
the device design and its functionality implementation.

By taking
advantage of such characteristics of the DLW method and
wisely selecting the carbonizable polymeric substrate as well as utilizing
hydrophobic/hydrophilic interfacial interactions, we show in our present
work a new template-free method for facile fabrication of PCPs with
arbitrarily deigned shapes. The DLW carbonizable substrate used in
our work is a composite sheet made of cellulose paper and sodium lignosulfonate
(CellP/NaLS), both components of which are widely available and biomass-based
renewable materials.63 Upon CO2 laser irradiation of such a composite sheet, the porous carbon feature
with a predesigned pattern and its arrays can be easily formed. A
subsequent immersion treatment in water would allow the spontaneous
detachment of the patterned carbon arrays to give PCPs with a uniform
size and arbitrarily designed shapes. As compared to other methods,
our new method for PCP production is simple, versatile, environmentally
benign, and highly robust. Upon further extension and optimization
works, for example, utilizing the laser irradiation source with a
shorter wavelength to achieve precisely controlled spatial and temporal
light intensity output, we expect this method could lead to a major
breakthrough in facile fabrication of PCPs with tailored pore structures,
a wide range of uniform sizes, arbitrarily complex shapes, and multiple-functionalities
suitable for many different applications.

2 Results
and Discussion
With varying the loadings of NaLS in the CellP/NaLS
composite sheet,
we identified that a 50 wt % condition was suitable for generating
patterned carbon arrays by CO2 laser irradiation at varied
laser power. In addition, such formed carbon arrays can also be robustly
detached from the parent substrate by water immersion treatment. With
this fixed NaLS loading level, we investigated the effect of laser
power on the structure and morphology of the line features created
by CO2 laser irradiation at a constant scanning speed of
10 mm/s. Figure 1a
shows the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of such freestanding
line features created at different levels of laser power. Within the
investigated range from 0.6 to 1.6 W, the line width increases from
167 to 305 μm. The expansion of the laser-affected zone with
increasing laser power not only occurs in the lateral direction of
the line feature but also exists in its depth direction. This is evidenced
by the cross-sectional images shown in Figure 1b. The line features created at varied levels
of laser power have been examined for their electrical conductive
property. With the resistance value R measured for
a given line feature of width W and length L, its sheet resistance was estimated according to Rsq = R × W/L. The Rsq results
of the line feature produced at different levels of laser power are
shown in Figure 1c.
Within the range of the laser power used in our experiments, the sheet
resistance of the line feature varied in a range of Rsq = 400–800 Ω/□, which is an indication
of a reasonably good electrical conductor. To obtain small-sized PCPs,
it is desired to have the basic feature size like the lines as small
as possible. With this in mind and guided by the results shown in Figure 1a,b, we further explored
even lower laser power conditions for creating various types of PCPs.
As shown by the Raman spectra in Figure 1d, the PCPs produced at low laser power (0.3–0.7
W) manifest the characteristic D-band (1343 cm–1) and G-band (1581 cm–1) of carbonaceous materials,
which indicates that the CellP/NaLS composite sheet can be carbonized
at very low laser power irradiation conditions. The relatively strong
D-band intensity with respect to the G-band as well as the broad band
width all indicate such formed carbon structures are mostly disordered.

PCPs produced at 0.5 W laser power irradiation; high-resolution C
1s (g) and O 1s (h) XPS spectra and the corresponding deconvoluted
results for the PCPs produced at 0.5 W laser power irradiation.

X-ray diffraction (XRD) was also
used for examining the structures
of the PCP formed at a low level of laser power (0.5 W). Figure 1e shows the result,
which is featured by a broad peak centered at 2θ = 22.5°
attributed to the diffraction of the (002) plane of turbostratic and
disordered carbons. In Figure 1e, one also notes the presence of residual cellulose as indicated
by the sharp peak that appeared at 2θ = 29.4° because of
the diffraction of the (200) crystallographic plane of crystalline
cellulose.64 The presence of residual cellulose
as well as NaLS in the carbon structures generated by low laser power
irradiation was further confirmed by FTIR. The IR spectrum of the
PCPs created at a laser power of 0.5 W is shown in Figure 1f, where we can identify the
functional groups associated with cellulose and NaLS, which include
the bands around 3450 cm–1 attributed to the vibration
of the hydroxyl group, the peak at 1616 cm–1 originated
from C–O stretching, the group of bands that appeared in the
region of 1000–1400 cm–1 because of symmetric
and asymmetric stretching vibration of the SO2 group, as
well as the bands around the region of 2855–2926 cm–1 associated with C–H vibrations.65 X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) revealed the atomic contents
of the PCP formed at 0.5 W laser power mainly composed of C, O, S,
and Na with a percentage of 68.98, 29.53, 1.17, and 0.32%, respectively.
In Figure 1g,h,
the high-resolution C 1s and O 1s XPS spectra of the PCP are respectively
shown. According to the previous study,66 we can conclude that, in addition to the dominated graphitic-like
sp2-carbon (284.8 eV, 58.6%), there are also abundant various
types of oxides existing on the surface of our PCPs. These groups
include phenolic, alcoholic, or ether groups (285.3–286.3 eV)
as well as carboxyl or ester groups (288.5 eV). The presence of abundant
oxides can also be confirmed by the O 1s spectrum, which shows that
the oxides mostly appeared as −OH (532.5 eV, 52.7%) as well
as C=O (531.7 eV) and C–O–C (533.2 eV).

We have demonstrated that the CellP/NaLS composite sheet can be
readily fabricated into electrically conductive carbon patterns with
low-power CO2 laser irradiation. Moreover, when immersed
in water, we found that such fabricated carbon patterns can be spontaneously
detached from their parent CellP/NaLS composite sheet without breakage.
In contrast, there was no such behavior being observed for the similar
carbon patterns fabricated by DLW on the commonly used polymer substrate—polyimide.50,57 The flexibility of the DLW process along with the spontaneous detachment
behavior of the carbon patterns formed on the CellP/NaLS composite
sheet would allow a new process for easily fabricating freestanding
PCPs of different shapes. For concept demonstration, in Figure 2a1, we show a snap-shot
of the detachment of a popular Chinese-knot-shaped PCP from its parent
CellP/NaLS composite sheet upon immersion in water. The live video
of this process can be found in the Supporting Information V1. In Figure 2a2, the intact and stand-alone Chinese-knot-shaped
PCP after the detachment process is shown. Figure 2a3 shows a snap-shot of the detachment
of an array of disc-shaped PCPs upon immersion in water. The live
video for this process can be found in the Supporting Information V2. The thickness of the freestanding PCPs fabricated
with this new process (laser power of 0.5 W in DLW) was ∼35
μm as determined by SEM (Figure 2b), which is roughly a third of the original thickness
of the parent CellP/NaLS composite sheet. The results shown in Figure 2a indicate that the
simple process developed here, namely, creating arrays of PCPs of
different shapes by DLW first and then immersing the parent CellP/NaLS
composite sheet in water, can be potentially used for facile fabrication
of PCPs of uniform size with arbitrarily designed shapes.

PCP from the parent CellP/NaLS composite sheet upon immersion in water;

500 μm. (e) Bar chart of the length, width, and thickness of
PCPs with a preset size of 1.5 mm × 1.5 mm (before and after
detachment from the substrate).

To make this point, we applied this new process and fabricated
the PCPs with a variety of different shapes. Figure 2c,d respectively show the optical and SEM
images of such prepared freestanding PCPs with different levels of
complexity in shape design. Limited by the laser-processing equipment
used in our experiments, the smallest carbon feature we produced was
a disc of 490 μm in diameter (Figure 2c6,d6). The accuracy
of our new process in size control for fabricating the freestanding
PCPs was examined by fabricating multiple PCPs with a predesigned
square-shaped pattern of size 1500 × 1500 μm. The results
are shown in Figure 2e. After the DLW process (0.6 W laser power), the as-prepared PCP
patterns were measured to have an averaged lateral size of 1550 ±
15 μm × 1466 ± 19 μm, which slightly deviate
(1–5%) from the targeted value. Upon water immersion treatment,
the finally formed freestanding PCPs showed no significant dimension
change, which had an averaged lateral dimension of 1490 ± 26
μm × 1463 ± 14 μm and thickness of 53 ±
6 μm.

The spontaneous detachment of the as-prepared PCP
upon water immersion
treatment left a fractured surface at both the PCP side and the side
of its parent CellP/NaLS composite sheet. The morphology of the fractured
surfaces was examined by SEM; and the results are shown in Figure 3a–d. The low
magnification images reveal the flat and smooth morphologies of the
fractured surface at both the PCP side (Figure 3a) and the parent composite sheet side (Figure 3c), which suggests
that the breakage/fracture at the PCP/cellulose fiber interface occurs
quite uniformly across the entire surface of the PCP. As shown by
the high-magnification images, the fractured surface at the PCP side
(Figure 3b) is dominated
by a hierarchical porous structure. In contrast, the fractured surface
left on the parent composite sheet mainly shows a solid texture occasionally
decorated by a few imprinted porous fiber-like structures (Figure 3d). The formation
of porous structures observed on the PCP side is because of pyrolysis/carbonization
of the CellP/NaLS composite upon laser irradiation treatment, which
has not occurred at the side of the CellP/NaLS composite sheet, to
leave a solid texture. The morphological results shown in Figure 3a–d indicate
that, as compared to the strength of bulk PCP and CellP/NaLS composite,
the interfacial strength between these two parts is much weaker. As
such, when the entire system is strained, the mechanical breakage/fracture
occurs at the interface between PCP and the underlying CellP/NaLS
composite substrate. This is a necessity for forming intact and freestanding
PCPs upon subsequent water immersion treatment. Because of the different
affinities of cellulose/NaLS and carbon to water, during such a treatment,
there would be an unbalanced interfacial tension created at the interfaces
of carbon/water (or PCP and water interface), cellulose/water (or
CellP/NaLS and water interface), and carbon/cellulose (or PCP and
CellP/NaLS interface). This then drives the interface between PCP
and the underlying CellP/NaLS to be strained, causing its spontaneous
detachment. To corroborate this hypothesis, we investigated the PCP
detachment behavior in ethanol. The reduced capability for the hydrogen
bonding formation between ethanol and cellulose as compared to water
and cellulose would expect to decrease the tendency for the formation
of the cellulose/ethanol interface. As such, the spontaneous detachment
would be impeded. This is indeed the case. When immersed in ethanol,
the PCP did not detach at all. Further experiments were performed
to observe the PCP detachment behavior in a mixture of ethanol and
water. Figure 3e shows
that, as the ethanol concentration increases, the time for the PCP
to detach correspondingly increases. By increasing the concentration
of ethanol from 0 to 80 wt %, the time for the completion of the detachment
gradually increases from ∼4 to ∼80 s. This observation
suggests that, in addition to the abovementioned thermodynamic reason,
the kinetic factors such as dissolution of NaLS and swelling of the
cellulose fiber may also play some roles responsible for the spontaneous
detachment of PCPs. With inclusion of both the thermodynamic and kinetic
factors mentioned above, we proposed a mechanism schematically shown
in Figure 3f to explain
the spontaneous detachment of PCP from its parent CellP/NaLS composite
sheet.

PCP and its parent cellulose/NaLS composite sheet upon a spontaneous

parent cellulose/NaLS composite sheet; (e) time-dependent spontaneous
detachment behavior of a PCP from its parent cellulose/NaLS composite
sheet when immersing in a mixture of ethanol and water; (f) proposed
mechanism(s) for the spontaneous detachment of the PCP from the CellP/NaLS

As revealed above, our PCPs possess a multitude of characteristics
like self-supporting, freestanding, electrically conductive, porous,
and easy fabrication with predesigned size and shape. This would allow
them to be valuable in many different applications. Here, we demonstrate
their use in dye adsorption, force sensing, and electrical energy
storage. Because of their high specific surface area, high porosity,
adsorption capacity, and excellent thermal/chemical stability, porous
carbon materials were often used for pollutant removal.67 As compared to the typically used powder-form
or granule-form carbon-based adsorbents, our PCPs possess self-supporting
and freestanding characteristics, which would be expected to simplify
the assembly of pollutant removal equipment as well as the recycling
process of adsorbents. With this in mind, we examined our PCPs for
their potential application in dye (methylene blue—MB) adsorption.
The corresponding real-time UV–vis spectra during MB adsorption
are shown in Figure 4a. Figure 4b shows
a representative MB adsorption kinetics of a single piece of PCP.
As shown in Figure 4b, a two-stage adsorption kinetics can be identified, which is presumably
caused by the hierarchical pore structures of our PCPs. The macrospores
inherited from the porous structure of paper are responsible for the
rapid MB uptake during the first stage. The meso- and micropores originated
from pyrolysis/carbonization of cellulose/NaLS responsible for the
slow MB adsorption occurred in the second stage. The total MB adsorption
capacity of our PCP is ∼0.21 g/g, which is in the same range
as that of other types of high MB-binding materials—activated
carbon, monocrystalline cellulose, and porous carbon monoliths.67 The high dye-binding capacity of our PCPs along
with their controllable uniform size and shape could be used for developing
novel adsorption assembly device/equipment that cannot be realized
by other types of dye adsorption materials.

the UV-vis absorption spectrum of the MB
aqueous solution with a piece of PCP immersed; (b) mass adsorption
kinetics of MB by unit mass of PCP.

In addition to dye adsorption, our PCP can also be used as
the
sensing element for making flexible electronics if bonded with a compliant
matrix, such as polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS). Figure 5a shows a prototypical device and Figure 5b shows its relative
resistance change when subjected to a cyclic tensile deformation up
to a maximum strain of 10%. The gauge factor (GF = (R/R0 – 1)/ε) of the PDMS/PCP
flexible strain sensor was estimated to be about 21, which is comparable
to the flexible sensors made of other types of carbon materials—graphene,68−71 carbon nanotubes,72−75 graphite,76 and so forth.

sensor made by bonding a piece of PCP on
the PDMS substrate; (b) relative resistance change of the PCP/PDMS
sensor (bottom) upon cyclic tensile deformation (top).

Porous carbons are the most commonly used materials
as supercapacitor
electrodes because of their large surface area, high electrical conductivity,
tailorable pore structure, and extraordinary chemical stability.77 Here, we demonstrated the potential application
of our PCPs as binder-free supercapacitor electrodes. Because of its
self-supporting and free-standing nature, the supercapacitor assembly
process facilitated by our PCPs is very simple. Two supercapacitor
assemblies, a solid square (Super-A) and a square-shape circle arrays
(Super-B), were prepared and tested for their long-term (1000 times)
charging–discharging performance. The mass of a single PCP
electrode for Super-A and Super-B is 0.12 and 0.05 mg, respectively.
With a constant current (I = 8 × 10–4 A) charging–discharging protocol up to a potential window
of ±0.3 V, we examined the charge storage performance of Super-A
and Super-B. The device pictures and testing results of Super-A and
Super-B are shown in Figure 6a,b. On the basis of the charging–discharging testing
results, according to C = (itd)/(mΔV), where i, td, m, and
ΔV are respectively the constant current, charging
or discharging time, the PCP mass, and the potential window for charging
or discharging, we estimated that the specific capacitance for a single
PCP electrode in Super-A and Super-B was 22.2 and 53.4 F·g–1, respectively. The self-supporting and freestanding
nature, their controllable uniform size and shape, as well as their
excellent stability and reversibility make our PCPs a promising candidate
for facile fabrication of miniaturized supercapacitor devices with
ease of assembly and consistent charge storage performance, which
can be hardly surpassed by other types of carbon materials.

supercapacitor assembly and its 1000 cycles of constant
current charging–discharging performance; (a) electrodes of
the supercapacitor are made of PCPs with a solid-square pattern; (b)
electrodes of the supercapacitor are made of PCPs with square-shaped
circle arrays.

The experimental results
on the application of PCPs for dye adsorption,
strain sensing, and as supercapacitors demonstrated their good mechanical
and electrochemical stability. Given that the chemical composition
of our PCPs is mainly composed of carbon, we also expect that they
should possess good thermal and chemical stabilities. All these characteristics
are important for PCPs to have long service time in practical applications.

3 Conclusions
In summary, we rely on laser irradiation-induced
carbonization
of a biomass-based composite, which is formed by infusion of sodium
lignosulfonate into cellulose paper (CellP/NaLS), and take advantage
of the strong affinity between water and cellulose to develop a facile
method for readily fabricating freestanding porous carbon platelets
(PCPs) with uniform size and arbitrarily designed shapes. The versatile
applications of such prepared PCPs in dye adsorption, as a flexible
sensor, and as miniaturized supercapacitors are demonstrated. The
advantages of their uniform size and arbitrarily designed shapes would
make the assembly/fabrication process of our PCP-based functional
devices much simpler, easy to control, and highly consistent. It is
believed that the method reported here will open a door for facile
fabrication of PCPs in a highly controlled manner and for exploration
of their more exotic applications in the fields of environment, energy
storage, sensing, catalysis, and so forth.

4 Experimental
Section
4.1 Materials and Methods
Commercial
NaLS (Aladdin, uncertain molecular weight) and cellulose filter paper
(89 g/m2, 0.1 mm in thickness, pore size of 30–50
μm, Hangzhou Double Circle Filter Paper Co., Ltd.) were used
in this work. The raw materials were dried at 60 °C for 24 h
in a vacuum oven before use. The PCPs were fabricated by a three-step
process. In the first step, the CellP/NaLS composite sheet was prepared
by soaking a piece of filter paper (mpaper = 2 g) into an aqueous solution of NaLS (10 wt %) for 20 min. The
cellulose paper soaked with NaLS solution was then dried at 80 °C
to give the CellP/NaLS composite sheet. This soaking/drying process
was repeated multiple times to achieve the CellP/NaLS composite sheet
with different loading levels of NaLS. To create porous carbon features,
a laser engraving and cutting system (SCE4030, Wuhan Sunic Photoelectricity
Equipment Manufacture Co., Ltd.; laser wavelength 10.64 μm)
was used for irradiating the CellP/NaLS composite sheet with a predesigned
pattern. The beam scanning speed was set at 10 mm/s and the laser
power used for fabricating the PCP array was varied in a range from
0.3 to 1.6 W. Subsequent to the laser irradiation treatment, the CellP/NaLS
composite sheet was then immersed in deionized water. Upon immersion,
the carbonized region with a predesigned shape and array pattern would
spontaneously detach from the parent sheet to form plenty of freestanding
PCPs, which were then collected and dried for later use in structure
characterization and property/performance evaluation. A real-time
video to show the spontaneous detachment of the PCPs can be found
in the Supporting Information—V1 and V2.

4.2 Characterization
The shape, size,
and morphology of the selected PCPs were examined by a scanning electron
microscope (Hitachi SU8010) and an optical microscope (MP41, Guangzhou
Mingmei Optoelectronic Technology Co., Ltd.). The carbonaceous structure
of the PCPs was characterized by Raman scattering spectroscopy. The
spectra were collected by a confocal Raman microscope in backscattering
geometry with a 633 nm excitation laser (LabRAM HR800, 50× objective).
With grinding the PCPs into fine powders and mixing with potassium
bromide for tablet sample preparation, the PCP chemical composition
was examined by a Nicolet IS50 Fourier transform infrared spectrometer.
The surface chemical composition of PCPs was measured by an ESCALAB
250Xi X-ray photoelectron spectrometer. The XRD pattern of the samples
in powder form was recorded on an X’Pert-Pro MPD diffractometer
system (PANalytical) operating at 40 kV and 40 mA with Cu radiation
(λ Cu Kα = 0.15406 nm) over an angular range of 5°–60°
at a step size of 0.026°. To examine the effect of laser power
on the electrical property of the laser irradiation-carbonized CellP/NaLS
composite, we fabricated a series of line features 3 mm long by varying
the laser power from 0.6 to 1.6 W with an interval of 0.2 W, the resistance
of which was measured by a Keithley 2182A Nanovoltmeter and Keithley
6221 current source at room temperature using a two-probe method.
For this purpose, the electrodes were prepared by adhering two copper
wires respectively to the two ends of the line feature with conductive
silver adhesive.

4.3 Application
4.3.1 MB Adsorption
The dye adsorption
behavior for the PCPs was determined by submerging the platelets in
an aqueous solution of MB (RG, MW = 319.85,
98%, Adamas-beta) at an initial concentration of 7.43 μM for
1 day at room temperature, ∼30 °C. During the submersion
process, the time-dependent absorption spectra of the dye solution
were collected using a vis–NIR high-resolution fiber-optic
spectrometer (Aurora4000, Changchun New Industries Optoelectronics
Technology Co., Ltd.).

4.3.2 Sensor Fabrication and
Its Piezoresistive
Performance Evaluation
With the previously described procedure,
an array of square-shaped porous carbons with individual size of 3
mm × 3 mm was fabricated. One of such freestanding carbon squares
was randomly selected and used for preparing a flexible strain sensor
with PDMS rubber as the elastic substrate. In brief, an appropriate
amount of room temperature-vulcanized PDMS formulation provided by
Fluorochem Ltd., vinyl-terminated PDMS (DMS41, MW = 62 700), mixed with a hydride functional siloxane
crosslinker (HMS-151, cSt: 25–36) at a mass ratio of 1:0.0249
and ∼150 ppm platinum complexes (C8H18OPtSi2, MW = 381.41,
J&K Scientific) was poured upon a glass slide at room temperature.
After waiting for the pre-curing process to proceed for ∼15
min, the carbon square was manually placed on top of the gelled PDMS,
followed by waiting for another 24 h for the system to completely
cure.

Subsequent to the curing process, the electrodes of the
sensor were prepared by adhering four copper wires separately to the
four corners of the carbon square with silver adhesive and curing
at 150 °C for 5 min. This mentioned procedure allowed for tightly
bonding of the carbon square with the PDMS substrate and it showed
good piezoresistive responses when the PDMS substrate was under mechanical
deformation. The carbon square/PDMS flexible sensor of size 25 mm
× 6 mm × 0.1 mm (length × width × thickness) was
tested at 30 °C for its piezoresistive response under a cyclic
tensile deformation by a coupled electrical–mechanical test.
In such a test, a Q800 dynamic mechanical analyzer (TA Instruments)
was used to ramp the tensile force from 0 to 0.075 N at a rate of
0.075 N/min and the corresponding maximum strain is 10%. Whereas the
sample was subjected to tension, the resistance of the carbon square
was simultaneously recorded by a Keithley 3706A and a 3721 dual 1/20
multiplexer card system switch/multimeter at a sampling rate of 1
s–1.

4.3.3 Supercapacitor Fabrication
and Its Electrochemical
Performance Evaluation
With the previously described procedure,
the square-shaped PCP of size 3 mm × 3 mm as well as the square-shaped
circle arrays of size 3 mm × 3 mm with their interior formed
by a 5 × 5 array of ring feature were fabricated. One piece of
these two different porous carbon patterns was weighted respectively
as 0.12 and 0.05 mg. The supercapacitor was constructed by sandwiching
two pieces of the previously prepared porous carbon along with a piece
of nylon filter paper (0.45 μm aperture, Suzhou Taislai Scientific
Instrument Co., Ltd.) as the separator between two nickel foil current
collectors (purity 99.96%, Yixing Xuneng Electronic Technology Co.,
Ltd.). The entire assembly had a thickness of 0.6 mm. A 3 M aqueous
solution of H2SO4 (AR, 98 wt %, Chinasun Specialty
Products Co., Ltd.) was used as the electrolyte for the electrochemical
performance evaluation of the supercapacitor assembly, which was performed
by an electrochemical workstation (RST5260F, Suzhou Risetest Electronic
Co., Ltd.) with the galvanostatic charge–discharge testing
method (voltage range setting: ±0.3 V; current setting: 8 ×
10–4 A).
