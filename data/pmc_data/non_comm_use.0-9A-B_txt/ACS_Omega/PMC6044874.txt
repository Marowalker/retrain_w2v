Endotoxin is the major structural
constituent of the outer membrane
of Gram-negative bacteria, which is a great threat to human health.
Herein, a sensitive electrochemical biosensor for the detection of
endotoxin is established by recording the voltammetric responses of
the peptide-modified electrode. The utilized peptide has a high affinity
for the target endotoxin, which ensures the high selectivity of this
method. After the capture of endotoxin on the electrode surface, a
negatively charged layer is formed, and the electron-transfer process
is significantly hindered because of the increased steric hindrance
and the electrostatic repulsion. The declined electrochemical signal
could be used to indicate the concentration of endotoxin. This method
is simple but effective, which requires limited reagents. Another
highlight of this method is its user-friendly operation. Moreover,
its applicability in human blood plasma promises its great potential
utility in the near future.

Introduction
Endotoxin, commonly termed as lipopolysaccharide
(LPS), is the
major structural constituent of the outer membrane of Gram-negative
bacteria.1,2 It comprises polysaccharide and lipid A
(Scheme 1a). Lipid
A moiety is of high toxicity to human beings with pyrogenic property,3 and endotoxin is highly responsible for the incidence
of a diversity of human diseases such as asthma, coughing, fever,
vomiting, dyspnea, diarrhea, shock, and so on.4,5 Because
endotoxin can be easily released into the bloodstream during the growth
of bacterial cells and cause severe human disorders, it is urgent
to detect such health-threatening toxin in foodstuff and medical supplies.6−9

Chemical Society. (b) Illustration of the Peptide-Based Electrochemical
Approach for the Detection of Endotoxin
Limulus amebocyte lysate (LAL) tests are commonly used
for endotoxin
quantification with three main strategies including the gel-clot method,10 the turbidimetric method,11 and the chromogenic method.12 LAL reagents are an aqueous extract of blood cells produced from
the horseshoe crab. After the reaction with endotoxin, obvious signals
are generated, which is due to the concentration of endotoxin. To
achieve higher sensitivities, more LAL reagent-based assays have been
developed such as elastography method,13 quartz crystal microbalance sensor,14 and electrochemical sensor.15 However,
all of these endotoxin detection methods rely on LAL reagents, which
have many disadvantages including false affirmative responses and
limited horseshoe crab sources.16

So far, significant efforts have been directed toward the development
of LAL reagent-free analytical methods. For instance, aptamer is a
specific single-stranded DNA that interacts with different targets
having certain nanostructures.17,18 Su et al. made use
of aptamers as the recognition element, which showed high affinity
for endotoxin in the fabrication of an impedance biosensor.19 Paul et al. employed cetyltrimethylammonium
bromide-capped gold nanospheres for fluorimetric sensing of endotoxin,
utilizing the electrostatic interaction between nanomaterials and
endotoxin that might enhance the fluorescence intensity.20 Nieradka et al. developed a microcantilever
array biosensor for the sensitive detection of endotoxin with the
help of a monoclonal antibody.21 Ding et
al. prepared polymyxin B-immobilized gold electrodes to recognize
and detect endotoxin using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy
(EIS).22 Jiang et al. designed living cells
to probe endotoxin, which could activate the expression of fluorescent
protein, and an optical biosensor was thus established.23

Besides, peptides can also be used as
an alternative recognition
element.24 Endotoxin-binding peptides have
been exploited recently.25 The peptides
can not only neutralize the toxicity of endotoxin, blocking the induced
inflammatory responses for sepsis treatment,26 but also have the potential to be used as specific ligands to develop
various fast and reliable detection methods for endotoxin.27 Phage display is the standard technique for
screening specific binding peptides to target molecules. The phage
display library contains different phage clones that encode different
peptides or proteins.28 In 2005, Kim et
al. selected two peptides, AWLPWAK and NLQEFLF, by biopanning on endotoxin-conjugated
epoxy beads. The two peptides were found to interact with the polysaccharide
moiety of endotoxin,29 which could be used
for the detection of Gram-negative bacteria.30 Guo and Chen then implemented several modifications to regular phage
display procedure and selected another two peptides, ASFPPAF and SSHTISF,
with improved binding affinity.31 Later,
Matsumoto et al. obtained the peptide named Li5-001 (KNYSSSISSIHAC),
which showed a high binding capacity to endotoxin with the Kd value of 10 nM.32 They also tried to modify the sequence of Li5-001 by replacing and
deleting amino acids, and they found that the obtained peptide Li5-017
(KNYSSSISSIHC) had a higher endotoxin binding affinity.33

In this article, we have referenced the
peptide with a high binding
affinity and developed an electrochemical method for the detection
of endotoxin in complex biological samples. The working principle
of the detection method is illustrated in Scheme 1b. Gold electrode is used as the working
electrode. The peptide is first immobilized onto the electrode surface
through the chemical adsorption of the C-terminal cysteine residue.34 A positively charged interface derived from
the other residues is thus formed after the treatment with mercaptohexanol
(MCH). A negatively charged electrochemical species, Fe(CN)63–/4–, can easily get across to the electrode
and generate electrochemical signals. However, after the specific
interaction between the peptide and endotoxin, the electron-transfer
process is significantly hindered because of the increased steric
hindrance and the abundant negative charges of endotoxin that repel
Fe(CN)63–/4–. By comparing differential
pulse voltammetry (DPV) responses, the endotoxin concentration could
be quantitatively determined.

Results and Discussion
EIS is first
used for the characterization of the modified electrode
in different steps using the redox probe of Fe(CN)63–/4–. In a typical Nyquist plot, the semicircle
portion observed at higher frequencies is related to the electron-transfer-limiting
process, and the linear portion at lower frequencies is related to
the diffusion process. As shown in Figure 1, when the electrode was modified with the
peptide and then MCH, a small semicircle appears, whereas a straight
line is exhibited in the case of bare electrode. After the capture
of a negatively charged endotoxin, the electron-transfer resistance
increases owing to the steric hindrance and electrostatic repulsive
force to Fe(CN)63–/4– anions,
which can be reflected by the significantly enlarged semicircle portion.
From the EIS curves, molecular assembly events are well-confirmed.

Figure 1 Nyquist
plots corresponding to (a) bare gold electrode, (b) peptide-modified
electrode, and (c) after interacting with endotoxin (10 EU/mL).

DPV is then employed to investigate
the different stages of the
electrode modification. As shown in Figure 2, a large current peak of Fe(CN)63–/4– is observed at bare electrode, indicating
an excellent electron-transfer efficiency. With the immobilization
of peptide and MCH, the peak decreases slightly because of the balance
of steric hindrance and electrostatic attraction force to the electrochemical
species. In the next step, endotoxin is specially attached on the
electrode surface via the interaction between the peptide and endotoxin.
There has been a notable decrease in the peak current because of the
combined effects of steric hindrance and electrostatic repulsive force. These
results confirm the successful immobilization of different molecules
on the electrode surface during the experimental procedures.

corresponding to (a) bare gold electrode, (b) peptide-modified
electrode, and (c) after interacting with endotoxin (10 EU/mL).

The performance of this electrochemical
biosensor for the endotoxin
assay at different concentrations and its repeatability are evaluated.
For selective capture, peptide with high affinity is chosen as the
recognition element, and the DPV peak current is used to indicate
the level of endotoxin. Figure 3 shows the DPV spectra of the electrochemical biosensor incubated
with different amounts of endotoxin: 0, 0.1, 0.5, 2, 10, and 50 EU/mL
(from bottom to top). The calibration plot of the peak current versus
the concentration of endotoxin is depicted in Figure 4 with the equation y = −8.740
+ 3.923x (R2 = 0.994, n = 3), in which y is the DPV peak current
and x is the logarithmic endotoxin concentration.

of the peptide-modified electrode after interacting
with different amounts of endotoxin (0, 0.1, 0.5, 2, 10, and 50 EU/mL,
from bottom to top).

Figure 4 Calibration curve representing the relationship between the DPV
peak current and the logarithmic endotoxin concentration (the error
bars display standard deviations of three independent measurements).

As shown in the plot (Figure 4), the peak current
is proportional to the endotoxin
level over the range 0.1–50 EU/mL, and the limit of detection
is calculated to be 0.04 EU/mL at 3σ based on the standard deviation
of the blank signal (n = 3). The comparison results
of the analytical performances of the developed biosensor with some
other reported methods are given in Table 1. The limit of detection is among the lowest,
and the linear range is quite wide. Moreover, after being stored at
4 °C for 1 month, the peptide-modified electrode will still be
suitable for accurate detection of endotoxin, which demonstrates the
high stability of the proposed electrochemical biosensor.

Attempts are further made to evaluate the
analytical features in
real samples by employing Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s
medium (DMEM) and human blood plasma samples for endotoxin tests.
The samples are first spiked with different amounts of endotoxin (2,
4, and 8 EU/mL), which are then used to interact with the peptide-modified
electrode. DPV spectra are recorded. After comparing the peak current
with the established standard curve, the endotoxin concentrations
are calculated, which are listed in Table 2. The recoveries are among 97.5 and 103.5%.
The relative errors are smaller than 5.6%, demonstrating excellent
repeatability and accuracy in real samples. All of these results promise
great potential practical applications.

Conclusions
In summary, we have presented herein a simple and cost-effective
electrochemical approach for endotoxin biosensing. Proof-of-concept
DPV experiments reveal that endotoxin levels could be readily distinguished.
The dynamic range of the method is from 0.1 to 50 EU/mL with a limit
of detection as low as 0.04 EU/mL. Because the chosen peptide has
high affinity for endotoxin, interference can be inhibited, and this
method is suitable for endotoxin detection in real biological samples,
which has been proved by the experimental results. This developed
endotoxin biosensor may have potential applications in testing the
cell culture medium, pharmaceutical products, and bacterial contaminations
in drinking water and environmental water.

Experimental Section
Materials
and Chemicals
LAL reagents, standard endotoxin,
endotoxin-free pipet tips, and water were purchased from Chinese Horseshoe
Crab Reagent Manufactory Co., Ltd. (Xiamen, China). Bovine serum albumin
(BSA), glucose, 1-3-β-d-glucan, tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine
hydrochloride (TCEP), MCH, and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid were
purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (USA). MgCl2 and CaCl2 were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co, Ltd. (China).
Immunoglobulin G was obtained from Sino Biological Inc. (China). DMEM
was obtained from Gibco (Gaithersburg, USA). Peptide (K-Li5) with
the sequence of KKNYSSSISSIHC was synthesized and purified by China
Peptides Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). Human blood samples were obtained
from healthy volunteers in the local hospital (Suzhou, China). The
other chemicals or reagents were of analytical grade as received.

Instrumentation
Electrochemical experiments were carried
out on a CHI 660D electrochemical workstation (CH instruments, China).
A traditional three-electrode system was employed, which consisted
of an Ag/AgCl reference electrode, a platinum wire counter electrode,
and a modified gold working electrode (2 mm diameter). EIS was performed
in 5 mM Fe(CN)63–/4– with 1 M
KCl with the following parameters: bias potential, 0.232 V; amplitude,
5 mV; frequency range, 0.1–100 000 Hz. DPV was carried
out in 5 mM Fe(CN)63–/4– with
1 M KCl. Parameters were as follows: initial potential, −0.4
V; final potential, 0.6 V; potential increment, 5 mV; amplitude, 50
mV; pulse width, 200 ms; and pulse period, 500 ms.

Electrode Pretreatment
and Peptide Modification
Before
the peptide modification, the substrate gold electrode was cleaned
according to a previously reported literature.40 Briefly, the electrode was first immersed in piranha solution
(98% H2SO4:30% H2O2 =
3:1) for about 5 min (Caution: Piranha solution reacts
violently with organic solvents and should be handled with great care!).
Next, the electrode was polished on P5000 sandpaper and then 1, 0.3,
and 0.05 μm alumina slurry. After that, it was rinsed with pure
water and then incubated in ethanol and pure water during ultrasonication
for 5 min, respectively. Afterward, the electrode was soaked in 50%
HNO3 for 30 min and then electrochemically cleaned in 0.5
M H2SO4. Subsequently, it was rinsed with pure
water and dried with N2. To modify the peptide on the gold
electrode surface, the peptide (K-Li5) was first dissolved in DMSO
and was diluted to be 0.2 mM with N-(2-hydroxyethyl)piperazine-N′-ethanesulfonic acid (HEPES) (20, 10 mM TCEP, and
pH 6.0). The pretreated electrode was immersed in the above peptide
solution for 12 h at room temperature followed by the treatment of
0.1 M MCH for 0.5 h, which could help the formation of a well-aligned
peptide monolayer. Subsequently, the electrode was rinsed using 0.2
M NaOH prepared with 95% ethanol to remove any absorbed endotoxin.

Endotoxin Analysis
Standard endotoxin was dissolved
using endotoxin-free water and swirled for 1 min. Then, it was diluted
to a series of concentrations. A 50 μL of standard endotoxin
was mixed with 50 μL of buffer solution (20 mM Tris-HCl, 150
mM NaCl, and pH 7.5), which was then dipped onto the surface of the
peptide-modified gold electrode. After 1 h, buffer solution (20 mM
Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% Tween-20, and pH 7.5) was used to rinse
the electrode. After being dried with N2, DPV was conducted.

Real Sample Assay
DMEM and human blood plasma were
used as real samples. DMEM was diluted four times. Human blood sample
was collected using a dedicated anticoagulation collection tube, which
was then centrifuged at 3000g for 1 min. The obtained
blood plasma was diluted 10 times using the buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl
and pH 7.5), which was then heated to 70 °C for 10 min. After
cooling to room temperature, the diluted DMEM and blood plasma were
spiked with different amounts of endotoxin. Subsequently, the samples
were detected using the proposed electrochemical method.
