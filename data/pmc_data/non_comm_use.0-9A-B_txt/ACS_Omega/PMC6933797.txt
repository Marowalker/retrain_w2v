Cytosolic sulfotransferases (SULTs) acting as phase II
metabolic
enzymes can be used in the sulfonation of small molecules by transferring
a sulfonate group from the unique co-factor 3′-phosphoadenosine
5′-phosphosulfate (PAPS) to the substrates. In the present
study, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and ensemble docking study
were employed to theoretically characterize the mechanism for the
effect of co-factor (PAP) and ligands (LCA, raloxifene, α-hydroxytamoxifen,
ouabain, and 3′-phosphoadenylyl sulfate) on structural stability
and selectivity of SULT2A1 from the perspective of the dynamic behavior
of SULT2A1 structures. Structural stability and network analyses indicated
that the cooperation between PAP and LCA may enhance the thermal stability
and compact communication in enzymes. During the MD simulations, the
obviously rigid region and inward displacement were detected in the
active-site cap (loop16) of the conformation containing PAP, which
may be responsible for the significant changes in substrate accessibility
and catalytic activity. The smaller substrates such as LCA could bind
stably to the active pocket in the presence of PAP. However, the substrates
or inhibitors with a large spatial structure needed to bind to the
open conformation (without PAP) prior to PAPS binding.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Metabolism of drugs in
the body mainly includes phase I and phase
II reactions. To be specific, phase I metabolism can convert a parent
drug to more polar (water soluble) active metabolites, occurring through
oxidation, reduction, and hydrolysis, whereas phase II metabolism
involves reactions that chemically change the drug or phase I metabolites
into compounds that are soluble enough to be excreted in urine.1 As phase II metabolic enzymes, cytosolic sulfotransferases
(SULTs) can be used in the sulfonation of small molecules by transferring
a sulfonate group from the unique co-factor 3′-phosphoadenosine
5′-phosphosulfate (PAPS) to the substrates.2,3 Besides,
they play a key role in detoxification by transforming a wide array
of small endo- and exogenous substrates from pharmaceutical, nutritional,
or environmental sources into more easily excretable metabolites.4,5 However, in some cases, SULTs transform their substrates to chemically
reactive or toxic metabolites, thereby inducing severe side effects.3,6,7 Apart from the functional sulfonation
of small molecules acting as substrates, various endo- and exogenous
substances such as drugs and environmental products can inhibit SULTs
so as to decrease sulfonation rates, therefore possibly promoting
various diseases.8−11

Human cytosolic sulfotransferases (hSULTs) could be classified
into four families (hSULT1, hSULT2, hSULT4, and hSULT6) based on sequence
similarity.12,13 Many family members are estimated
to have very broad and overlapping substrate specificities, which
are required in their detoxifying roles. Besides, the co-factor binding
to the active sites may further influence the spectrum of substrates.12 SULT2A1 is critical in xenobiotic metabolism
in adults and is mainly found in the tissue and liver.14 To date, the crystal structures of SULT2A1 with
co-factor 3′-phosphoadenosine 5′-phosphate (SULT2A1/PAP),
SULT2A1 with substrate dehydro-epiandrosterone (SULT2A1/DHEA), SULT2A1
with substrate androsterone (SULT2A1/ADT), and SULT2A1 with co-factor
PAP and substrate lithocholic acid (SULT2A1/PAP/LCA) have been accessible
in the Protein Data Bank with PDB ID 1EFH, 1J99, 1OV4, and 3F3Y, respectively.13,15,16 Recent studies have found that the free
enzyme and the ligand-bound complex show significant conformational
differences in the active-site cap region (a dynamic ∼30 residue
stretch of amino acids), which can dominate the specificity and activity
of the enzyme.17,18 The SULT2A1 complex with the
co-factor tends to exhibit a relatively closed entrance and a compact
local structural ordering around the pathway, while the complex with
the substrate shows an open entrance.19

In recent years, while experimental and structural studies
on the
SULT2A1 complex are generally developed, computer-based investigation
for the ligand binding mechanism and accompanying structural differences
remains scarce.17,20,21 In our study, a combination of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations
and the ensemble docking study was applied to investigate the impact
of ligands (co-factor and substrate) on the structural stability and
selectivity of SULT2A1. We explored four systems for SULT2A1, including
free enzyme, binary complexes (SULT2A1/PAP or SULT2A1/LCA), and ternary
complex (SULT2A1/LCA/PAP). The computational data may prove that the
binding of ligands (PAP and LCA) had a significant impact on the structural
stability of SULT2A1, and the PAP binding generating the structural
displacement in the active-site cap (loop16) could affect the substrate
selectivity of SULT2A1. Our investment could provide the theoretical
basis for the discovery of the binding mechanism of SULT2A1.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Structural Stability Analysis
In
general, enzymes working during metabolism have rather broad and overlapping
substrate specificities. It is reported that SULT2A1 shows the highly
flexible active binding pocket, including loop5 (residues 42–45),
loop7 (residues 76–79), loop12 (residues 138–144), and
loop16 (residues 227–251). Particularly speaking, loop16 simultaneously
mediates substrate and co-factor interactions and is defined as the
dynamic active-site cap. Here, the dynamics-based analysis of structural
stability was employed for different ligand binding complexes. First,
analyses of the root-mean-square deviation (rmsd) of the protein backbone
were calculated to describe conformational changes of the four systems.
As shown in Figure 1A, all three systems remained comparatively stable for at least 200
ns except for SULT2A1 without any ligand. Especially, the PAP-bound
complexes experienced the more stable trend than the conformations
without co-factor bounds. The probabilities based on the rmsd plots
(Figure 1B) indicated
that the rmsd value of SULT2A1/LCA/PAP fluctuated at 0.5–1.5
Å, which was the lowest among the four systems. The radius of
gyration (Rg) is often used to estimate
the potential for the plasticity of the protein structure. The plot
of Rg and corresponding probability (Figure 1C,D) indicated that
the Rg value of the SULT2A1/LCA/PAP complex
was stabilized at around 18.6 Å, which represented the most compact
structure compared with that of other three systems, while the Rg value of enzymes without any ligand was approximately
19.0 Å. Besides, the structure of the SULT2A1/PAP complex was
more coherent than that of the enzyme with the substrate LCA-bound
(SULT2A1/LCA). Further, the solvent accessible surface area (SASA)
is able to quantify the area in enzymes exposed to the solvent. It
is now a commonly accepted concept that the active site of the enzyme
is located in the cavity of the hydrophobic environment. Because the
substrate is bound with the active site, the interaction between the
substrate and the catalytic group will be stronger than that in the
polar environment. The tendencies of SASA for the active binding pocket
and its relative frequency (Figure 1E,F) showed that the SASA contribution of the SULT2A1/LCA/PAP
complex was the lowest among the four systems, which indicated that
the SULT2A1/LCA/PAP complex could provide a decent hydrophobic environment
for the next substrate binding. All these suggested that the co-factor
(PAP) and substrate (LCA) showed mutual stabilizing effect for each
other and the cooperation between them had synergy effect on the thermal
stability of the enzyme.

2.2 Ligand Binding Enhanced the Communication
between Residues in Protein–Ligand Complexes: Network Centrality
and Protein Structure Network Analysis
To explore the effect
of ligands on the structural communication of the active site, we
employed the network centrality parameter, namely, betweenness, for
studying the representative structures obtained from the four trajectories.
The betweenness analysis enables us to identify the critical mediating
node as a bridge for communication between residues in network graphs.
The frequency distribution graphs of the betweenness values (Figure S2) indicated that the frequency of complexes
combined with PAP had a longer tail of the distribution in comparison
with other two conformations (SULT2A1 and SULT2A1/LCA), which indicated
that the PAP binding may induce a dramatic promotion of communication
flow through several functional residues. In order to verify this
conjecture, the betweenness calculation for every residue was performed
to establish a relationship between the structural stability and network
centrality in functional residues (Figure 2A). In the SULT2A1/LCA/PAP complex, the betweenness
graph revealed the noticeable peaks in accordance with relatively
flexible residues gathered at the active binding site (loop5, loop7,
and loop12) and its surrounding region (loop3 and α7/α8),
while the enzyme without any ligand binding showed the lowest betweenness
value among four structures (Figure 2A,B). The high betweenness residue is apt to establish
a more compact communication module connecting structurally stable
communities, which may be responsible for the stable conformation.

four representative structures, including the SULT2A1 (yellow), SULT2A1/LCA

of communities. (E) Degree distribution of residue hubs.

Then, the structure-based network analysis was
carried out to detect
the stable interaction communities/cliques and the organization of
local hubs for the representative structures obtained from the four
trajectories. The cliques are defined as a group node (k = 3, k = 4, and k = 5), which
are connected to each other. As depicted in Figure 2C, the number of cliques for PAP-bound complexes
(SULT2A1/PAP and SULT2A1/LCA/PAP) (the clique number = 440) was larger
than that for the free enzyme and SULT2A1/LCA complex (the clique
number = 395, 382). Similarly, the total number of stable communities
for PAP-bound complexes moderately increased compared with that for
free enzyme and only LCA-bound complex (Figure 2D). In addition, the local residue hubs in
the networks were also computed to describe the degree of highly connected
nodes (at least 4). As shown in the graph (Figure 2E), when the degree of a residue hub (the
number of nodes in a hub) was greater than 8, the larger distribution
of hubs was detected in the SULT2A1/LCA/PAP complex, which could be
responsible for the tighter connectivity of communities in the ternary
complex.

Finally, the subnetworks for interfaces between ligands
and protein
were extracted to comprehend the discrepancy of binding affinity of
PAP and LCA for complexes (Figure 3). The interfaces revealed that the cooperation of
PAP and LCA binding may strengthen the interactions between ligands
and protein, reflected in the fact that the number of interactions
in the ternary complex was greater than that in the PAP- or LCA-binding
complexes. Given these results, we could figure out that the combination
of PAP may give rise to more inseparable communication between nodes
in the active pockets and more stable interaction between ligands
and protein in a synergistic fashion. On the contrary, we could conclude
that the substrate LCA as a small ligand was difficult to stably bind
to the conformation in the absence of PAP. The results obtained here
slightly differ from the known conclusions. Cook et al. stated that
the active-site access to ligands that are small enough to pass through
the closed pore should not be restricted by the position of the active-site
cap (or the presence of PAP).17

2.3 Effect of Ligands on Protein–Ligand
Interaction
Because proteins perform their functions through
their interaction with ligands, the interaction between the ligand
and protein is crucial for understanding biochemical processes in
drug designing and pharmacology. Here, the probability of hydrogen
bond formation between protein and ligands is listed in Table 1. Obviously, the hydrogen bond
interaction between ligands and protein in the SULT2A1/LCA/PAP complex
was stronger than that in the PAP- or LCA-bound complex. Specifically,
for the interaction of protein and substrate LCA, the hydrogen bonds
were centered on residues Tyr231 and Tyr238 located at loop16 (the
active-site cap), and their occupancy in the ternary complex was larger
than that in the SULT2A1/LCA complex. Besides, one new hydrogen bond
was formed between residue Asn48 (located in α2) and the substrate
LCA in the ternary complex. Further insights into the interactions
between protein and PAP help comprehend the fact that residues Lys44
(located in loop5) could form more stable hydrogen bonds with co-factor
PAP in the ternary complex compared with the SULT2A1/PAP complex,
which are 93.1 and 75.8%, respectively. Equivalently, the occupancy
of the hydrogen bond occurred in residues Thr47/Asn48 (located in
α2), Arg121/Ser129 (located in α7), and Arg247/Lys248/Gly249
(located in loop16) of the ternary complex was larger than that of
the SULT2A1/PAP complex. Apart from hydrogen bond interaction, the
alkyl−π interaction, one of the weak interactions, was
calculated for ligand-bound complexes on 500 ns time scales. Seen
from the visual inspection of structures in Figure 4A,B, residues Phe18, Trp72, Trp77, and Tyr238
could form alkyl−π interaction with the substrate LCA.
As shown in Figure 4C–F, it is apparent that the distance between two atoms which
could form alkyl−π interaction in the ternary complex
could be stable at around 4–5 Å, indicating the stronger
interactions compared with that in the SULT2A1/LCA complex. All these
results could offer a clue that the cooperative binding of the co-factor
and substrate could remarkably strengthen the protein–ligand
interactions, which is critical for proteins to accomplish their functions
through binding with various ligands. At the same time, it is further
confirmed that the substrate LCA could strongly interact with protein
in the presence of PAP.

2.4 Structural Motion after Binding of Ligands
To explain the enhancement of protein–ligand interaction
and the communication between residues in the network from the perspective
of conformational changes, the analysis of the correlated intermolecular
motions was performed as shown in Figure 5, which can reflect the intense relevant
conformational changes in protein regions. In general, the red regions
represented as positive values indicated the strongly correlated motions
of residues, while the blue regions standing for negative values may
be associated with the anticorrelated movements. The diagonal region
showed the highly correlated structural motions because it was the
relevant movement of a residue with itself. Apparently, SULT2A1 without
any ligand displayed the largest thermal fluctuations among the four
systems (Figure 5A).
The substrate- or co-factor-bound complexes (SULT2A1/LCA or SULT2A1/PAP)
experienced the decreased flexibility, which manifested as the lighter
color in the cross-correlation matrix maps (Figure 5B,C). The correlated motion of the ternary
complex became the weakest (Figure 5D), which is consistent with the structural stability
analysis above. Besides, the fluctuations of the dynamic active-site
cap (loop16) in the four systems signified the steadiest conformational
mobility in the ternary complex.

500 ns MD trajectories
of the (A) SULT2A1, (B) SULT2A1/LCA, (C) SULT2A1/PAP, and (D) SULT2A1/LCA/PAP
complexes. Positive regions (colored in red) indicated strongly correlated
residue motions, whereas negative regions (colored in blue) indicated
anti-correlated movements. The position of the active site cap (loop16)
was highlighted by boxes in each map.

Through in-depth studies of the specific motion
trend and dominant
motions of the four systems during the 500 ns MD, the first principal
components of the Cα atoms (PC1) were visualized with the color
scale from blue to red depicting low to high atomic displacement (Figure 6). Notably, the PC1(s)
of loop12/loop16 (the active site) in the apo-enzyme showed the moderate
atomic displacement (Figure 6A). The quite active motions occurred in the PC1(s) of loop7/loop16
in the SULT2A1/LCA complex (Figure 6B) and that of loop12 in the SULT2A1/PAP complex (Figure 6C). Conversely, the
motion of the active-site loop was much weaker in the presence of
PAP and LCA (Figure 6D) compared with that of other three systems, which conforms well
to the cross-correlation analysis mentioned above. These analyses
of structural motion suggested that the cooperative binding of PAP
and LCA could strengthen the compactness of the protein. Especially
for the active binding site, these loops showed obvious and stable
rigidity in the ternary complex. In addition, we could detect that
the PAP binding resulted in the structural rearrangement in the active-site
cap (loop16) with an inward moving trend (closed motion). Such a dynamic
motion detected in the simulation is in agreement with the model proposed
by Cook et al., which allows the enzyme to isomerize between open
and closed states when PAPS is bound.17 The free energy landscape (FEL) was depicted to characterize the
first two principal components of the Cα trajectory. As shown
in Figure S3, the surface of the SULT2A1/LCA/PAP
complex was flatter than that of other three systems. In addition,
the lowest-energy region for the ternary complex was achieved after
110 ns and was the largest zone compared with that of other three
complexes, which indicated that the co-factor- and substrate-bound
complex went through a relatively short transition stage to reach
equilibrium. The lowest-energy structures from the four trajectories
were obtained at 245, 170, 136, and 118 ns, respectively. All these
structures were extracted as representative structures for the protein
structure network analysis mentioned above.

(B) SULT2A1/LCA, (C) SULT2A1/PAP, and (D) SULT2A1/LCA/PAP trajectories.
Color scale from blue to red depicts low to high atomic displacements.

Further, the dynamics-based analysis of the pliability
of the dynamic
active-site cap (loop16) also confirmed the motion results. As shown
in Figure 7A,F, loop16
of the SULT2A1/LCA/PAP complex experienced minimal conformation variations
among the four systems, with a fluctuation of 0.84 Å. Loop16
of the SULT2A1/PAP complex was more stable than that of SULT2A1 containing
LCA only (SULT2A1/LCA), corresponding to fluctuations of 1.94 and
2.55 Å, respectively (Figure 7E,C). Notably, there was significant inward displacement
of the cap in the PAP-binding structure, which has been reported crucial
for substrate selectivity (Figure 7D).17,22 It has been reported that the
active-site cap (loop16) is segmented into two parts that cover the
co-factor and the substrate binding site.17 From the fluctuation analysis, we could detect that the presence
of PAP resulted in stabilization of the cap with a closed conformation,
which may provide a clue for the assumption that the substrate LCA
is prone to stably interact with protein in the PAP-containing complex
rather than the SULT2A1 structure without PAP binding.

2.5 Selectivity of SULT2A1 Based on the Plasticity
of a Conserved Active-Site Cap
Apart from the effect of SULT2A1
on small molecules which act as substrates, SULT2A1 can also be inhibited
by a variety of endogenous or exogenous substances that perform their
inhibitor functions.9−11 Inspired by the work of Martiny et al.,23 we decided to explore the selectivity of SULT2A1
using the ensemble docking method. Because molecular docking has been
optimized for the prediction of ligand binding positions and affinity,
our goal was to research the selectivity of sulfotransferases based
on the position and affinity from the best mode. To obtain sufficient
protein structures for the ensemble docking, cluster analysis was
performed on two MD simulation trajectories (SULT2A1/LCA and SULT2A1/LCA/PAP).
After clustering, the frames of SULT2A1/LCA and SULT2A1/LCA/PAP trajectories
were divided into five and six clusters according to conformational
similarity (Figure S4). After removing
the LCA from the representative structures, 177 substrates and inhibitors
collected from the BRENDA database (Figures S5 and S6) were docked in these structures. Here, the lowest binding
affinity of the docked conformation was visualized in heat maps (Figure S7). It is worth noting that a large proportion
of small molecules docked with the closed SULT2A1/LCA/PAP conformation
(shown as the deeper color) presented lower energy compared with the
SULT2A1/LCA complex. However, for very small ligands such as 1-butanol
(no. 28), 2-propanol (no. 55), ethanol (no. 117), and methanol (no.
126), there was almost no binding affinity for either open or closed
conformations. Further, the free energy of large-size molecules, such
as raloxifene (no. 21), 3′-phosphoadenylyl sulfate (no. 145),
and adenosine 3′,5′-bisphosphate (no. 156) binding to
the open conformation (SULT2A1/LCA), was lower than that of the molecules
binding to the closed conformation. In addition, the binding affinity
of α-hydroxytamoxifen (no. 94) and ouabain (no. 131) for open
conformation was merely slightly lower than that for the closed one.
By comparing the size of these molecules, we suspected that the larger
the molecule is, the easier it is to combine with the open SULT2A1/LCA.

Visualization of the docking position is presented in Figure 8. In the absence
of the PAP structure, the docking positions were dispersed both at
the substrate and co-factor binding pocket (Figure 8A). However, in the presence of the PAP structure,
most of substrates and inhibitors were aptly docked into the substrate
binding pocket except for several molecules with large size. The visualization
of large-molecule docking events (Figure 8C,D) indicated that the large molecules were
merely able to bind to the open structure (without PAP) because in
the PAP-containing structure, the inward motion of the cap narrowed
the space of the substrate binding pocket to prevent the large molecules
such as raloxifene (no. 21) from binding in the active binding pocket.
Moreover, the computed atlas of surface topography of the protein
(CASTp) server24 was used to measure the
area and volume of the active pocket. The results of calculation are
listed in Table 2.
We could find that the area and volume of the SULT2A1/LCA/PAP complex
decreased approximately 50% compared with that of the SULT2A1/LCA
complex, reflecting significant discrepancy in substrate accessibility
between the presence and absence of PAP, which may be pivotal in the
catalytic process. The structure diagram of representative structures
confirmed that the active binding pockets of SULT2A1/LCA/PAP displayed
relatively narrow space compared with the conformations without PAP
(Figure S8). Based on these results, we
could conclude that the structural rearrangement of the active-site
cap (loop16) upon PAP binding determined the selectivity of the substrates,
which fits with the study of the binding affinities of SULT2A1 presented
by Cook et al.17,18 Their binding studies showed
that the affinity of raloxifene will decrease in the presence of PAP; Kd (raloxifene) increases 21-fold (1.1 ±
0.2 to 29 ± 4 μM) at a saturating concentration of PAP.17 To be efficiently sulfated, the large substrate
such as raloxifene with a side group needed to bind to the open conformation
(without PAP) prior to PAP binding, which can also be seen in the
study of structural rearrangement of SULT2A1 published by Cook et
al.22 Nevertheless, the smaller substrate,
such as LCA, was more likely to bind in the closed substrate binding
pocket (with PAP) because the closed conformation may provide a more
favorable space and environment of the pocket that may enhance the
binding affinity between protein and ligands.

2.6 Interaction Fingerprint Analysis
To investigate the interactions between protein and ligands in the
open and closed complexes, we generated the interaction fingerprint
(IFP) analysis based on the docking conformations. In the open SULT2A1/LCA
complexes (Table 3),
Phe18 (located in loop3), Lys44 (located in loop5), Trp72 (located
in α3), Trp77 (located in loop7), Phe133/Trp134 (located in
α7/α8), Phe139 (located in loop12), Tyr160 (located in
loop13), and Leu234 (located in loop16) were critical for the ligand
binding. Specifically, most ligands (92 and 84%) could form strong
hydrophobic interactions with Phe18 and Phe133, respectively. A part
of ligands (56, 40, 56, and 56%) could form polar interactions with
Lys44, Asn48, His99, and Tyr160 separately. Further, for the closed
SULT2A1/LCA/PAP conformation (Table 4), we could figure out that Pro14/Met16/Gly17/Phe18
(located in loop3), Pro43/Lys44 (located in loop5), Asn48 (located
in α2), Trp77 (located in loop7), Phe133/Trp134 (located in
α7/α8), Phe139 (located in loop12), Tyr160 (located in
loop13), and Tyr 231/Leu234/Tyr238 (located in loop16) mainly participated
in ligand binding. Compared to open conformation, more ligands could
form hydrophobic interactions with Met16, Phe139, Phe18, Phe133, and
Leu234, respectively. In addition, polar interaction was more important
to stabilize the structure, indicating that more ligands (72, 96,
and 72%) could form polar interactions with Lys44, Asn48, and His99
compared with the SULT2A1/LCA complex. Overall, for most ratio ligands,
α2, loop3, loop5, α7/α8, and loop16 of closed conformation
(PAP-containing) played a more important role in ligand binding in
comparison with the interactions in open conformation.

2.7 Structural Stability and Movement after Binding
of Large Ligands
To explore the structural stability and
movement of large molecules for the open/closed conformation, raloxifene
(no. 21), α-hydroxytamoxifen (no. 94), ouabain (no. 131), and
3′-phosphoadenylyl sulfate (no. 145) bound to SULT2A1 and SULT2A1/PAP
structures were used in MD simulation with 500 ns time scales. Seen
from Figure S9, the rmsd of the protein
backbone calculations was performed to describe conformational changes
of the four systems. It is obvious to find that the PAP-bound complexes
experienced the more stable trend than the conformations without PAP.
The compactness of the protein structure was estimated using the Rg calculation (Figure S10). Apparently, the PAP-binding complexes were more coherent than
the structures without the presence of PAP.

Thus, it is interesting
to investigate the intense relevant conformational changes in protein
regions based on these MD trajectories. The map of correlated intermolecular
motions (Figure S11) indicated that the
PAP-containing structures displayed the lighter thermal fluctuations
compared to the structures without PAP, which were reflected in shallower
color in the map. In addition, the first principal components of the
Cα atoms (PC1) were visualized to describe the specific motion
trend with the color scale from blue to red depicting low to high
atomic displacement (Figure 9). Notably, the PAP binding was able to stabilize the motion
of the structure and promote loop16 present in an inward mode (Figure 9B,D,F,H). Furthermore,
from analysis of the pliability of loop16 (Figure 10), we could detect that the PAP binding
resulted in the more rigid conformation than the structures without
PAP. Meanwhile, the closed mode in loop16 occurred after PAP binding.
The cooperative binding of PAP and inhibitors could not only strengthen
the compactness of the protein but also induce the closed motion in
loop16. These analyses of structural stability and motion are consistent
with the analysis based on the MD simulations of LCA and/or PAP binding.

and (H) SULT2A1/raloxifene/PAP complexes.

2.8 Interaction Changes between Large Ligands
and the Open/Closed Conformation
First, the subnetworks for
interactions between protein and ligand were obtained to compare the
binding affinity of different ligands for the absence and presence
of complexes (Figure 11). The subnetworks for different representative structures revealed
that the larger ligands such as 3′-phosphoadenylyl sulfate
(no. 145) and raloxifene (no. 21) could form stronger interactions
with the open conformations (absence of PAP) (Figure 11E,G), compared with that with the closed
conformations (presence of PAP) (Figure 11F,H). Interestingly, for α-hydroxytamoxifen
(no. 94) and ouabain (no. 131), the number of interactions in the
absence and presence of complexes did not differ extensively (Figure 11A–D).

sulfate, (F) SULT2A1/3′-phosphoadenylyl sulfate/PAP, (G) SULT2A1/raloxifene,
and (H) SULT2A1/raloxifene/PAP complexes.

Second, the changes of nonbond interaction energy
[van der Waals
(vdW) and electrostatic energy] between protein and ligand in MD simulation
were recorded to verify the analysis mentioned above. From Figure S12C,D, we could learn that the nonbond
energy in the SULT2A1/3′-phosphoadenylyl sulfate and SULT2A1/raloxifene
complexes (black) was significantly lower than that in the presence
of PAP structures (red). Besides, the electrostatic interaction could
be the main interaction for the SULT2A1/3′-phosphoadenylyl
sulfate complex, while in the SULT2A1/raloxifene complex, electrostatic
and vdW interactions were both reasons of stabilizing protein and
ligand interactions. Meanwhile, as shown in Figure S12A,B, the nonbond energy in the SULT2A1/α-hydroxytamoxifen
and SULT2A1/ouabain (black) was simply slightly less than the energy
in the complexes containing PAP (red). Thus, for α-hydroxytamoxifen
(no. 94) and ouabain (no. 131), the binding affinity in their complexes
with SULT2A1 (the open mode) was not much less, compared with that
in the SULT2A1/PAP complexes (the closed mode).

Finally, the
hydrogen bond and alkyl−π interactions
were calculated for the MD simulations of raloxifene (no. 21) and
3′-phosphoadenylyl sulfate (no. 145) bound to SULT2A1 and SULT2A1/PAP
structures. As shown in Figure 12A–C, residues Lys44, Asn48, Glu79, and His99
were capable of forming stable hydrogen bonding interactions with
3′-phosphoadenylyl sulfate in the absence of PAP for most of
the simulation time (shown as pink). Similarly, seen from Figure 12D,E, residues Lys44
and Asn48 could form hydrogen bonding interactions with raloxifene.
Besides, residues Phe133 and Trp134 could form alkyl−π
interactions with raloxifene in the complexes without PAP, indicating
that the distance of two atoms could be stable at around 4–8
Å. All these results could verify the conclusion of ensemble
docking, that the large molecules (3′-phosphoadenylyl sulfate,
raloxifene) may be more likely to bind to the open conformation first,
while the molecules such as hydroxytamoxifen and ouabain had no prominent
advantage in binding to the open conformation, compared with the closed
mode (in the presence of PAP).

3 Conclusions
The effect of ligands on
structural stability and selectivity of
sulfotransferases is significant for understanding the sulfonation
process of small molecules catalyzed by sulfotransferases. In the
present work, we applied the MD simulations with protein structure
network analysis and the ensemble docking study for SULT2A1, SULT2A1/LCA,
SULT2A1/PAP, and SULT2A1/LCA/PAP systems first. The analysis of structural
stability during the MD simulations indicated that the co-factor (PAP)
and substrate (LCA) presented mutual stabilizing effect on the structural
stability of enzymes. Further, the network centrality and protein
structure network analyses confirmed that the cooperation of PAP and
LCA was able to enhance the structural stability and compact connectivity
in the protein structure network. Besides, we detected that PAP binding
played a crucial role in increasing the binding affinity of the substrate
LCA. Specifically, the substrate LCA was prone to stably binding to
the active binding pocket in the presence of PAP, and the interaction
between protein and the substrate LCA was strengthened since the PAP
binding. To gain some insights into the mechanism of the enhanced
stability and interaction in terms of conformational changes, the
structural motion after binding of ligands was described using cross-correlation
and principal component analysis (PCA). Obviously, the most stable
conformational mobility was detected in the SULT2A1/LCA/PAP complexes.
Meanwhile, since the PAP binding, the active-site cap (covering both
the co-factor and the substrate binding site) had inward displacement
to close the active binding pocket, which could be responsible for
drastic changes in the substrate accessibility and the catalytic activity.
Such dynamic displacement detected in the simulation is in line with
the model proposed by Cook et al., which allows the enzyme to isomerize
between open and closed states when PAPS is bound.17 To research the selectivity of sulfotransferases based
on the position and affinity, the ensemble docking study for 177 substrates
and inhibitors was performed to comprehend the significant alteration.
Based on the docking study, we could find that PAP binding to the
conformation resulted in a narrower active pocket in comparison with
the absence of PAP. Such a small spatial active binding pocket may
prevent the large substrate such as raloxifene and 3′-phosphoadenylyl
sulfate from binding to the pocket. On the contrary, the small pocket
consisting of α2, loop3, loop5, α7/α8, and loop16
may play a more important role in the binding of small ligands such
as LCA to a closed conformation (PAP-containing). In addition, the
dynamic behavior of conformation and changes of protein–ligand
interactions in MD simulations of large molecules bound to the proteins
with/without PAP can improve our understanding of changes in the SULT
structure during the reaction cycle. The analysis of structural stability
and movement after binding of large ligands also showed that the cooperation
of PAP and inhibitors could enforce that structures are more compact,
and loop16 presented a closed motion after PAP binding, which could
be responsible for the selectivity of SULT2A1. The interaction changes
between large ligands and the open/closed conformation also demonstrated
that the larger the molecule is, the easier it is to bind to the open
SULT2A1.

4 Materials and Methods
4.1 Protein Preparation and MD Simulation
The X-ray structure of the SULT2A1 complex with PAP and lithocholic
acid (LCA) was obtained from the RCSB Protein Data Bank (www.rcsb.org) (PDB ID: 3F3Y). The free SULT2A1
and binary complexes (SULT2A1/LCA and SULT2A1/PAP) were derived from
the crystal structure of the SULT2A1 complex with both PAP and LCA
(PDB ID: 3F3Y). PAP rather than PAPS was chosen to study the influence of PAP(S)
on the structural flexibility of SULTs based on the nearly identical
binding site for PAP or PAPS and the belief that they have the same
effects.18,25 Therefore, in the present study, 500 ns
MD simulations were performed for four systems: (1) SULT2A1, (2) SULT2A1/LCA,
(3) SULT2A1/PAP, and (4) SULT2A1/LCA/PAP. All four initial structures
were constructed with crystallization water molecules. After molecules
were removed, four models were solvated in a cubic periodic box with
TIP3P water and 125 000 water molecules. The distance between
the periodic boundary conditions and the closest protein atom was
set to 12 Å. The charge of four systems was neutralized with
counterions (Na+, Cl–) concentrated at
0.15 mol/L. The protonation states of co-factor PAP and substrate
LCA were assigned to mimic the experimental pH conditions. The H++
server was utilized to determine the protonation states of charged
amino acids.26 The long-range electrostatic
interactions were calculated using the particle mesh Ewald algorithm.27 Noncovalent vdW interactions were cut off at
13.5 Å. Bond length involving hydrogen atoms was constrained
using the SHAKE algorithm28 with the integration
time step of 2 fs. Prior to MD simulations, in order to prevent improper
geometry and steric clashes, energy of four systems was minimized
with the steepest-descent algorithm. The 500 ns MD simulations for
four systems were performed using NAMD 2.7 package29 with CHARMM27 force fields30 and the TIP3P water model.31 Topology
and parameters of PAP and LCA were acquired from CHARMM CGenFF files.
All production was performed under constant temperature (310 K) and
1 atm constant pressure with a time step of 2 fs.31 The snapshots of the 500 ns were taken with an interval
of 100 ps to analyze the impact of the cofactor and the substrate
on the structure and dynamics of the enzyme.

4.2 Network Centrality Analysis
Network
centrality analysis is able to compute weighted centrality with corresponding
selected nodes, incorporating the analysis of the weighted degree,
shortest path closeness, and betweenness.32,33 The edge weights in residue interaction networks (RINs) are assumed
to be the strength of the residue interaction. Therefore, the scores
of weights must be converted to distance scores, that is, smaller
distance scores are deemed as stronger interactions between the connected
nodes. Shortest path centralities indicate that the distance between
two nodes is the length of the shortest path between them. Specially
speaking, the shortest path betweenness computes the frequency that
pairs of nodes (not directly connected) pass through the node of interest
(the bridge node) over the shortest paths. A bridge node that frequently
occurs in the shortest paths is more capable of facilitating connections
between pairs of nodes. The formula is as follows 1  where Pjk, determined by the Floyd–Warshall algorithm,34 is the number of shortest paths between nodes j and k and Pjk(i) is the number of shortest paths
through node i between nodes j and k.35

The network centrality
computations were performed using the Cytoscape plugin RINalyzer.36,37 The analysis settings are shown as follows. The attribution as edge
weight was assigned to NrInteractions, and the multiple edges were
handled via using the average weight option. Besides, the weighted
degree was cut off at 1 Å, and the max-value option was used
for converting scores into distances.

4.3 Protein Structure Network Analysis of Protein–Ligand
Complexes
Recent advances have demonstrated that protein
structure networks provide valuable insights into the global structural
properties, functions, and stability of protein.38,39 Protein structure can be represented as networks by defining the
amino acids as nodes and the noncovalent interactions as edges identified
by the probe.36,40 In our study, RINs for 3D structures
of SULT2A1/PAP, SULT2A1/LCA, and SULT2A1/LCA/PAP were generated from
RINerator software.36 Nonbonded side-chain
interactions were calculated in line with the normalization values
of contact between residues.40 The analysis
of RINs was performed using the RINalyzer and visualized in Cytoscape.37 The corresponding structures were displayed
in PyMOL package. The network parameters were utilized to analyze
the RINs covering clusters, hubs, cliques, and communities.41 The hubs represent highly connected nodes in
the network whose degrees are at least 4. A k = n clique is a group of “n”
nodes with each node connected to every other node in networks. A
community of k = n cliques is a
collection of cliques that share n – 1 nodes
among them. All these network parameters were computed by using CFinder
2.0.6 software.42 Input parameters for
CFinder originate from RINerator. The protein structures used in the
protein network analysis were the representative structures from the
snapshots of the 500 ns MD in the free SULT2A1, SULT2A1/LCA, SULT2A1/PAP,
and SULT2A1/LCA/PAP complexes.

4.4 Cross-Correlation Analysis
Cross-correlation
analysis was performed using Bio3D version 2.3.043,44 to assess the extent to which the atomic fluctuations/displacement
of a system are/is correlated with one another by examining the magnitude
of all pairwise cross-correlation coefficients.45 The Bio3D dccm() function returns a matrix of all atom-wise
cross-correlations whose elements may be displayed in graphical representation
frequently termed a dynamical cross-correlation map or DCCM. In this
map, the coordinate axis scale corresponds to the atomic number. The
red region indicates that the more positive the matrix element value,
the more positive the correlation is between the two atomic motion
modes; the white region in agreement with the matrix element value
is 0. More blue regions signify that the matrix element value is more
negative, indicating that the corresponding two atomic motion modes
tend to be negatively correlated. The diagonal of the matrix is the
variance, which must be greater than zero, and so it is white or reddish.

4.5 PCA and FEL Analysis
PCA was performed
using Bio3D version 2.3.043,44 for examining the relationship
between different conformations, and the most significant conformational
changes in 500 ns MD of the SULT2A1, SULT2A1/LCA, SULT2A1/PAP, and
SULT2A1/LCA/PAP structures during the trajectory were taken as samples.
All representative structures based on disparate conformational motions
were extracted by package ncdf4 implemented in the Bio3D functions46,47 and visualized by VMD 1.9.3.48 The energy
of macromolecule conformations such as the first two principal components
(PC1, PC2) were characterized in the FEL.49 By using the program converting dot distribution to probability
distribution (ddtpd), the trajectories to PC1 and PC2 of motion were
mapped.50−52

4.6 Cluster Analysis
Clustering of the
structures of a trajectory can be accomplished using disparate methods
(algorithms) and different criteria to judge structure similarity.53 Here, according to the quality threshold-like
(qt) method, rmsd-based clustering was performed to classify the similar
structures in two trajectories of SULT2A1 and SULT2A1/PAP into the
distinct group. The rmsd cutoff was set to 1.5 Å for each trajectory.
After clustering, the proportion of each cluster was counted, and
the similar conformation in trajectories of SULT2A1 and SULT2A1/PAP
was split into the same cluster. The representative structures extracted
based on the cluster analysis were used for further ensemble docking.

4.7 Ensemble Docking Study
AutoDock is
a suite of automated docking tools, consisting of two generations
of software: AutoDock 4 and AutoDock Vina. It is designed to predict
the substrates or drug candidates bound to a receptor of known 3D
structures. AutoDock 4.2 is the latest faster version, combining rapid
energy evaluation to find suitable binding positions for a candidate
on a known 3D structure.54 AutoDock Vina
is an open-source program for doing molecular docking and virtual
screening.55 For the preparation of the
receptor (macromolecules), AD4-type atoms and Kollman charges were
assigned into the receptor, and polar hydrogen atoms were merged into
the associated heavy atoms. Besides, the grid box containing active-site
residues was added using the AutoDock tool program.54 For the preparation of ligands, the substrates and inhibitors
of SULT2A1 were obtained from the BRENDA database.56 The MOL files of small molecules were converted into the
PDBQT form using the AutoDock tool program. After the ensemble docking,
eight bits (any, backbone, side chain, polar, hydrophobic, H-donor,
H-acceptor, aromatic) were used to describe IFP. For each ligand’s
atom, the residues within the cutoff range were selected. The occurrence
of interaction was determined by atom–atom distance, type of
atoms/residues, and appropriate angle when bound with hydrogen. On
this basis, an average SIFt may be generated for the population of
ligands and/or receptors.
