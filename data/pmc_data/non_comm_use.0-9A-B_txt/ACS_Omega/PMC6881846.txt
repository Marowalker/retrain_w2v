A photoreactor was designed, built,
and optimized to carry out the degradation of phenol. To achieve this,
phenol concentration was used as the reference to compare the photocatalysis
reaction efficiency obtained through this research with results from
other studies. Additionally, during the building process, different
types of glass were evaluated with the objective of finding a functional
and economic material to build the photoreactor. It was found that
Pyrex glass was the most suitable material to work with. As a UV light
source to build the photoreactor, a dry gel nail lamp was used with
9 W, λ = 365 nm bulbs. On the other hand, the effects of different
parameters (such as the catalyst mass (TiO2 Degussa P-25),
stirring speed (RPM), UV lamps, and temperature) over the photocatalysis
reaction rate were analyzed. Also, the reaction’s thermodynamic
parameters were determined and found to be similar to those found
in other investigations. Finally, the homogeneity in the distribution
of TiO2 particles inside the reactor when stirred at 475
rpm was verified using a COMSOL Multiphysics computer fluid dynamics
simulation, which showed the theoretical trajectory of particles inside
the reactor depending on the stirring rate of the reactor.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Currently,
heterogeneous photocatalysis is considered as one of the research
areas among advanced oxidation processes of greater interest.1,2 In this process, a semiconductor material is irradiated with UV
light to produce highly reactive oxygen species (e.g., hydroxyl radicals),
which can carry out the degradation of organic compounds that are
difficult to eliminate via traditional wastewater treatment methods.3

Now, photocatalysis reactions require reactors
with specific optic characteristics, such as a high transmittance
and reflectance, using mostly clear materials, such as fluoropolymers
(FP) and glass, which allow a high transmittance of UV rays to the
sample.4 However, the main issue with fluoropolymers
is their low mechanic resistance. Because of this, while using this
material, it is necessary to increase the photoreactor’s wall
thickness, thus decreasing the transmittance of UV rays.

Therefore,
the most common material in photoreactor design and construction is
glass, but its efficiency depends on the type of glass that is used.
For example, common glass has a variable iron concentration in its
composition, allowing different grades of UV light absorption. Compared
to common glass, borosilicate glass (Pyrex) has a higher transmittance
at wavelengths between 300 and 400 nm. However, the main disadvantage
of this material is its high cost.5

Additionally, to maximize the yield of the photocatalysis reaction,
it is necessary to use materials that allow a high reflectance of
UV radiation; in a photoreactor design, it is vital to consider various
material characteristics to optimize the UV radiation that irradiates
the catalyst. Among some of the materials used, silver mirrors are
preferred for their high reflectivity in the visible spectrum, although
their reflective capacity is poor for wavelengths between 300 and
400 nm; during the manufacturing process of these mirrors, common
glass is used as a protective cover, diminishing the material′s
capability to absorb UV radiation. On the other hand, aluminum is
also used to fabricate various photoreactors. Nevertheless, when this
material is oxidized, it loses its highly reflective characteristics.5

Currently, there are many UV lamp types
available in the market. Those most commonly used in photoreactors
are high-pressure mercury vapor, low-pressure mercury vapor, and fluorescent
and xenon lamps, among others.6 Furthermore,
other UV lamps with more specific applications can be easily found
in common markets, as they are used to disinfect surfaces or even
dry gel nail polish.

Regarding photocatalysts, titanium dioxide
(TiO2, Degussa P-25) is commonly used because of its physicochemical
characteristics and high photocatalytic activity.7,8 This
material’s characteristics of interest are the crystal size,
specific surface area, pore structure, and high adsorption capacity.9

Phenol is considered as a priority pollutant
(at concentrations over 1 mg L–1) according to the
United States of America Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Therefore,
it has been widely studied in photocatalytic reactions and used as
a reference molecule for the evaluation and design of photoreactors.10,11

Now, there are aspects such as particle distribution that
are not easily seen by the naked eye during experiments, but should
be understood as they can explain how important parameters affect
a reaction, such as the stirring speed. For this purpose, computational
resources have become useful, by providing a mathematic environment
where realistic approaches to phenomena can be modeled, without the
need for specific and complex experimentation. When used effectively,
computational resources such as COMSOL Multiphysics give accurate
representations of the physical characteristics of a model, such as
the temperature, pressure, and velocity profile of a continuously
stirred fluid in a defined vessel or even the trajectory of a solid
particle that interacts with a continuously stirred fluid inside a
reactor.

The objective of this research is to (1) present the
design of a photoreactor,12 (2) evaluate
the effect of different reaction parameters over the photodegradation
process,13,14 and (3) verify the effect of stirring inside
the reactor using simulation environments. For the reactor’s
construction, economic and easy-to-access materials were used seeking
to take advantage of the greatest amount of UV radiation possible.
Finally, the phenol concentration was followed to determine optimum
photoreactor design parameters. Thus, the reactor presented in this
research can be used to study the degradation of different organic
pollutants in an aqueous phase.

2 Experimental Section
2.1 Reactants
Photocatalyst:
titanium(IV) oxide nanopowder; primary particle size: 21 nm (TEM);
≥99.5% trace metal basis (Aeroxide Degussa P-25, Sigma Aldrich).

Phenol solutions: crystallized phenol, 99%
(detached crystals), PS (pancreac), and distilled (type 1) water.
A stock solution (1000 ppm) was prepared by weighing 1 g of phenol
and dissolving it into a 1 L volumetric flask. After this, small amounts
of stock solution were diluted in a 250 mL volumetric flask to obtain
concentrations of 5, 10, 25, 33, 50, 75, and 100 ppm. The dilutions’
concentrations were verified using UV–vis spectrophotometry
(Thermo Spectronic Genesys 5). Table 1 shows the physical properties of dyes and chemicals
used in this work.

solution to verify that the temperature is always at the constant,
desired value (298, 308, 318, and 326 K) when the reaction is taking
place.

Additionally, a magnetic stirrer
(length 5 cm and Ø = 1 cm) was used at different stirring rates
(0, 200, 400, 475, and 800 rpm).



3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Photoreactor Construction
Seeking to use common, nonexpensive materials, a commercial lamp
used to dry gel nail polish was used as a UV light source.16 This apparatus consisted of four 9 W lamps with
a maximum wavelength peak of 365 nm each, an electronic circuit (used
to toggle the device on and off), a piece of aluminum adhesive, and
a plastic case. Almost all parts were used to design the photoreactor,
only leaving the plastic case behind (Figures 1 and 2).

Figure 1 UV lamp used to dry the gel nail polish
(picture taken by authors).

Figure 2 Electronic circuit used
to toggle the UV lights (picture
taken by authors).

Regarding
the reactor’s structure, it was important to evaluate how the
glass type used for its construction affected the reaction’s
efficiency; three types of glass were evaluated: common glass, Pyrex,
and quartz. These materials were evaluated under a UV–vis spectrophotometer
(Genesys 5) to determine the materials’ transmittance in a
wavelength range between 300 and 500 nm.

The results obtained
during this test are shown below in Figure 3, where it is evident that in the visible
range, between 400 and 500 nm, all three materials have a transmittance
of 100%. However, for wavelengths in the UV-A range (315–380
nm), each type of glass behaves differently. Throughout the UV-A range,
quartz glass exhibits a transmittance of 100%, while Pyrex and common
glass exhibit reduced transmittances of 40 and 1.3%, respectively,
at 300 nm.

Figure 3 Transmittance values of different glass types: quartz
(black line),
Pyrex (red line), and common glass (blue line).

However, this reduction in transmittance is associated
with the concentration of iron particles in each material. For example,
the quartz glass that was used had an iron percentage of 3.6 ×
10–5, which is a smaller concentration compared
to the 0.07% of iron present in the common glass sample (values given
by the manufacturer). Therefore, based on these results, it is possible
to infer that the material’s transmittance decreases as a function
of iron concentration in the sample (in an inversely proportional
manner).17,18 Taking this into account, Pyrex glass was
chosen to build the photoreactor because of quartz’s high cost
and the fact that, at a wavelength of 365 nm, Pyrex glass shows a
transmittance of 99.7%.

3.2 Photoreactor Design
In a photocatalytic reaction, just
like in other reactions, many variables must be controlled. In this
case, the most important variables include the pH, temperature, stirring
speed, UV lamp placement and wavelength, radiant flux, and initial
concentration. Therefore, the instrumentation needed to control these
variables must be included in the design of the reactor, as the control
of the main variables that determine the reaction will ensure that
the pollutant is being degraded and also give a better understanding
of the degradation mechanism. The photon flux was determined by potassium
ferrioxalate actinometry, and the obtained value was 9.37 × 1015 photons/cm2/min.

Taking the need for instrumentation
and control into account, the following design was proposed (Figure 4).

Figure 4 (a) Frontal view of the
reactor with the following
main parts: (1) opening for taking the sample, (2) gas inlet (for
N2, O2, or air, although the photoreactor may
work without the insertion of gas into the system), (3) water inlet
for the reactor’s jacket, (4) water outlet of the reactor’s
jacket, (5) gas outlet for the main reaction’s products, (6)
reactor body, (7) reactor lid, and (8) UV lamp vessel. (b) Frontal
view of the reactor with its main dimensions in millimeters. (c) Frontal
view of the reactor with the main dimensions of the inlet and outlet
tubes in millimeters.

Figure 4 shows the reactor
and the main parts that compose it, which are identified using the
numbers in parentheses. A description of its functionality as well
as every part’s measurements can be seen below. First, tube
(1) (12.5 cm high, Ø = 0.6 cm) is used for sample extraction.
In this tube, a 5 mL syringe is connected and used to extract and
retain small samples. Next, an L-shaped tube (2) (inner section: 5.7
cm, Ø = 0.6 cm) is used as a gas inlet for the reaction to insert
N2, O2, or air, if necessary. However, it is
important to know that the reactor can function without the need of
a gas inlet. Now, the photoreactor body (6) consists of two concentric
cylinders (Ø = 6.6 and Ø = 8.7 cm). Inside the first cylinder,
the reaction occurs, while between the boundaries of the two cylinders
is the reactor’s jacket, which is used to control the reaction
temperature, maintaining it at the desired temperature. The heating
fluid used inside the jacket is water, which enters the jacket on
tube (3) and exits the jacket on tube (4), and is recirculated constantly.
Moreover, tube (5) is used as a gas outlet, where the concentration
of CO2 in the reactor can be analyzed, as CO2 is one of the main products of the mineralization of organic compounds.
Next, both the photoreactor body (6) and its lid (7) are made of Pyrex
glass and reinforced with Teflon clamps as well as metal clamps. Finally,
the top box (8) contains two UV, 9 W lamps, which operate at a maximum
wavelength of 365 nm and a voltage of 120 V.

The photoreactor
lid is manufactured using Pyrex glass. The reactor’s top view
is shown in Figure 5.

Figure 5 (a) Reactor’s top view. The main components shown
are (1)
tube for taking the sample, (9) connection to other instruments, and
(10) connection to a pH-meter. (B) Reactor’s top view with
the lid’s main dimensions in millimeters.

Figure 5 depicts
the following features: (1) is the tube used for taking the sample,
(9) is a hole (Ø = 0.6 cm) and a GL 25 screw cap, which is open
at the top with an adjustable septum and is used to insert several
instruments (Thermometer, Titrator, Thermocouple), and (10) is a hole
(Ø = 1.2 cm), which connects to a pH-meter. All of these holes
are designed with shut-off valves or screw caps, which allow the analysis
of the different variables necessary to evaluate the reaction at a
certain time. Every hole can be sealed to eliminate environmental
interference when the samples are evaluated.

3.3 Determination of Optimal Reaction Parameters
To successfully determine the photocatalysis reaction rate, it
was modeled under a pseudo-first-order kinetic model with an apparent
rate constant, which represents both the adsorption and reaction phenomena
(eq 1). 1  where Co is the reactant’s initial concentration,
while C corresponds to its concentration at any moment
of time (t). If the experiments adjust correctly
to a pseudo-first-order kinetic model, then a linear function is obtained
by plotting .

3.3.1 Determination of the
Optimum Weight of the Catalyst
To determine the optimum amount
of the catalyst to be used in the photocatalysis reaction, the reaction’s
degradation rate was evaluated for different amounts of the catalyst
(10, 50, 77, 100, 150, and 200 mg). The results from these experiments
are shown in Figure 6, where it is observed that for weights lower than 100 mg, the reaction
rate is 33% lower than that for amounts larger than 100 mg; however,
further increase in the amount does not cause a significant increase
of the reaction rate. In other words, once the mass of Degussa P-25
is greater than 100 mg, a screening effect occurs between the catalyst
particles, giving rise to a photon barrier as a product of UV radiation.
Therefore, to obtain a maximum degradation rate (equal to 0.07 h–1), it is necessary to use 100 mg of the photocatalyst.

Figure 6 Influence of the catalyst’s
mass over
the reaction rate kapp. These experiments
were conducted under the following conditions: an initial phenol concentration
of 100 ppm, a stirring rate of 800 rpm, and a temperature of 293 K.
Each dot represents a different experiment, while the red and black
dotted lines represent the maximum amount of catalyst and the data’s
mathematical fit.

3.3.2 Influence of the
Stirring Speed
Regarding the effect of stirring speed over
the reaction rate, various stirring rates, between 0 and 1000 rpm,
were evaluated to understand the effect of turbulence and catalyst
distribution inside the reactor. According to the results shown in Figure 7, the degradation
rate presents an upright increase between 200 and 400 rpm, reaching
its maximum at a value near 500 rpm (475 rpm). In this case, when
the maximum value of the apparent reaction rate (kapp) is equal to 0.44 h–1, the particles
are totally irradiated and homogeneously distributed inside the reactor.
On the other hand, at low stirring speeds, the particles settle at
the bottom, while (Figure 4a) rates higher than 475 rpm create a concentration gradient
by pushing most catalyst particles to the walls of the reactor away
from the light by centrifugal forces (Figure 4b).

Figure 7 Effect of the stirring speed over the apparent reaction
rate, kapp. Each point corresponds to
an experimental
value of kapp for a different stirring
rate. The conditions for these experiments were an initial phenol
concentration of 100 ppm, 100 mg of catalyst, and a temperature of
293 K; (a) particle sedimentation at low speeds and (b) vortex effect
for turbulent regimes.

3.3.3 Effect of the Wavelength of UV Light
Besides the catalyst’s mass and stirring speed, the reaction
rate also varies as a function of the light source used to stimulate
the particles. To start a photocatalytic reaction, it is necessary
to stimulate the catalyst with enough energy so that its photogenerated
holes (h+) react and produce reactive oxygen species.19 For example, the energetic requirement for TiO2 is equal to 3.02 eV, usually provided by wavelengths that
are lower than 400 nm. Now,
to ensure that the catalytic reaction is taking place, the light source
must not only react with the pollutants. If the pollutant reacts with
the light source, it will absorb radiation and produce specific reactions;
this is a process known as photolysis.

Figure 8 shows that phenol’s photolysis occurs
at a wavelength of 254 nm (using 9 W Phillips TUV bulbs). On the other
hand, at 365 nm, there is no interaction between the UV light source
and the molecule, maintaining a constant phenol concentration over
time.

Figure 8 Influence of the UV wavelength over the reaction’s
development.
Experimental conditions: an initial phenol concentration of 100 ppm,
a temperature of 293 K, 100 mg of catalyst, and a stirring speed of
475 rpm. The red dots represent the formation of phenoxy radicals
(photolysis at 254 nm), while the black dots correspond to the phenol
concentration (using UV lamps with λ = 365 nm).

3.3.4 Effect
of Temperature over the Reaction Kinetics
To test the effect
of temperature over the reaction rate, this parameter was varied between
298 and 326 K under the following reaction conditions: an initial
phenol concentration (Co) of 100 parts
per million (ppm), 100 mg of TiO2 Degussa P-25, and a stirring
speed of 475 rpm. Figure 9 shows that the reaction rate increases proportionally with
the temperature, achieving its maximum at 326 K. Additionally, the
experimental data fit a first-order kinetic model in which the reaction’s
efficiency depends on the temperature. Regarding the results in Figure 9, adsorption kinetics
are exothermic;2 therefore, at low temperatures,
the adsorption of pollutants onto the catalyst’s surface is
favored, while product desorption increases with temperature.

Figure 9 Influence of temperature
over the catalysis reaction rate. Experimental conditions: a stirring
speed of 475 rpm, 100 mg of TiO2 nanoparticles, and an
initial phenol concentration of 100 ppm. The dotted lines correspond
to the linear fits.

Next, the Arrhenius expression (eq 2) was used to determine the reaction’s activation
energy.20 2  where kapp is equal to the apparent reaction rate, A is the Arrhenius factor, Ea corresponds
to the reaction’s activation energy, R is
the constant for ideal gases (8.3144 J K–1 mol–1), and T is the reaction’s
temperature (K). Now, the linear form of Arrhenius’s expression
is as follows (eq 3): 3  The activation energy (Ea) may be obtained by plotting ln kapp vs 1/T, where the slope is equal
to −Ea/R, while
the y intercept corresponds to ln A (Figure 10). In this case, the experimental data approximate to a linear fit
with a correlation coefficient (R2) of
0.9975. This means that 99.75% of the data can be expressed by the
equation obtained from the linear fit. In this case, the calculated
value of the reaction’s activation energy corresponds to 21.95
kJ/mol, which is similar to the value of 21.44 kJ/mol reported in
the literature.20

Figure 10 Arrhenius plot.

Then, the thermodynamic
parameters were determined using Henry Eyring’s linear equation
(eq 4):21 4  The values of Δ ≉ S0 and
Δ ≉ H0 were obtained by plotting
ln(kapp/T) vs 1/T, where the slope corresponds to  and the y-intercept corresponds to . These parameters can be calculated knowing
that Kb is Boltzmann’s constant
(1.3805 × 10–23 J/K) and h is Planck’s constant (6.6261 × 10–34 J/s). This plot can be seen below in Figure 11:

Figure 11 Eyring plot.

After obtaining Δ ≉ S0 and Δ ≉ H0, it was possible to determine the standard Gibb’s
free energy by using eq 5 5  Finally, after calculating all of
the reaction and thermodynamic parameters, they were sorted into the
following table:

As can be seen in Table 2, kapp increases
as the temperature increases. This can be explained by different processes
that occur: (1) the temperature might affect the interfacial rate
of electron transfer to oxygen due to the recombination rate slowly
increasing with the temperature;22 (2)
however, the holes localized on surface oxygen atoms are stabilized
due to the adsorption of water;23 and (3)
the temperature induces a faster rate of pollutant/product desorption,
which might lead to a higher availability of active sites for surface
reactions.

On the other hand, the enthalpy value of Δ
≉ H0 = 20.57 kJ/mol shows that
the photodegradation reaction is an endothermic process. Because of
this, the overall reaction requires an initial stage of photon absorption
on the catalyst’s surface to generate the electron–hole
pairs, but the amount of energy is specific for each photocatalyst
(TiO2 Degussa P-25 uses a wavelength lower than 400 nm).
This is also explained by the fact that the values obtained for the
Gibb’s free energy indicate a nonspontaneous process. Finally,
mechanisms that do not encompass photocatalysis are responsible for
the negative entropy value.

3.4 CFD Simulations
After analyzing the effect
of the stirring speed over the reaction rate, a group of computational
models were developed to observe and compare this parameter’s
effect over the velocity profile and particle distribution inside
the designed reactor. This was achieved using COMSOL Multiphysics
5.2 implementing, first, a rotating machinery laminar flow model (rmspf)
to determine the velocity profile of the fluid inside the reactor,
with which it is possible to compute a particle tracing for fluid
flow (fpt) model to identify the appearance of “dead”
stirring zones with low to no particle movement. The model’s
geometry and mesh are shown in Figure 12.

Figure 12 CFD
and particle tracing model geometry and mesh. (a) Geometry including
the liquid reaction volume (250 mL) and the magnetic stirrer. (b)
Physics-controlled mesh with 106882 domain elements, which was used
to compute the simulations.

Regarding the model’s assumptions
and inputs, first, it is assumed that after a short moment, the stirring
speed reaches a constant value; therefore, it is possible to carry
out a steady-state simulation with a constant stirring speed. Additionally,
the reactor’s walls have a non-slip boundary condition, and
water was modeled as an isothermal incompressible flow. Also, water
was used as the reference fluid as the concentration of phenol in
the reactor is very low, and so the fluid’s properties approximate
very closely to those of water. Now, regarding the input parameters,
the fluid is at a temperature of 318 K, with 1 atm reference pressure
and an initial velocity field of 0 m/s, and is subject to a rotational
speed of 475 rpm.

To observe the manner in which the particle’s
velocity and distribution inside the reactor changed, the stirring
speed was subjected to a parametric sweep, analyzing speeds of 100,
300, and 475 rpm. Stirring speeds higher than these were evaluated
but not included because they failed to converge successfully. At
higher speeds, a transition from a laminar flow regime to a turbulent
flow regime appears. Because the reactor was modeled using a rotating
machinery laminar flow model, changing the system’s physics
requires new governing equations to fully characterize the system
and this in turn entails the input of new model parameters, which
were not necessary to achieve the objectives of this study.

Figure 13 shows how
particles change their velocity proportionally with the reactor’s
stirring rate. First, it can be observed that because the designed
reactor uses a radial stirring system, a dead or zero-velocity stirring
zone is always present at the center of the reactor’s geometry.
Additionally, this stirring mechanism is associated with low-turbulence
regimes as the particles are homogeneously distributed among different
velocity profiles across the x–y planes. Furthermore, these results match with those of Figure 7. For example, most
particles in Figure 13a have a velocity ranging from 0 to 0.2 m/s, causing their sedimentation
at the bottom of the reactor.

Figure 13 Catalyst particle speed
and trajectories for stirring
speeds of (a) 100, (b) 300, and (c) 475 rpm.

After obtaining the results for
these simulations, it can be observed that because a radial stirring
system is used, a dead stirring zone is always present at the center
of the reactor’s geometry. This type of stirring mechanism
is related to low-turbulence regimes as the particles are homogeneously
organized among different velocity profiles across the x–y planes, explaining the UV screening effect
observed for high stirring rates, when vortexes are formed. Furthermore,
by analyzing the y–z velocity
profiles, it is possible to observe that at higher stirring speeds,
the average velocity inside the reactor increases, ensuring a homogeneous
distribution of catalyst particles.

As evidence of this statement,
it is possible to observe the velocity profile of the liquid inside
the reactor across the x–z plane as this plane allows one to observe the behavior of the vortex
and the streamlines generated by the magnetic stirrer’s movement.

In the case of Figure 14, the most representative differences between the velocity
profiles may be observed in the diagonal and upper streamlines. For
example, for a stirring speed of 100 rpm, the average speed of these
regions is represented by a dark blue color, which corresponds to
a velocity of approximately 0.02 m/s. As stated before, this means
that at low stirring speeds, the momentum transport inside the reactor
occurs at the bottom of the flask. Therefore, there is not enough
energy for the liquid to form a well-defined vortex capable of conferring
enough vertical motion to the nanoparticles. On the other hand, for
a speed of 475 rpm, these low-velocity dead zones are replaced by
a more homogeneous velocity profile along the vertical axis. This
can be seen in Figure 14c, as the velocity of the diagonal and superior streamlines resembles
that at the bottom, at approximately 0.64 m/s.

Figure 14 Velocity profiles of
the liquid inside
the reactor for stirring speeds of (a) 100, (b) 300, and (c) 475 rpm.

Thanks to these
simulations, it is possible to understand the effect of the stirring
speed over the catalyst’s distribution inside a reactor and,
therefore, on the reaction. This is extremely important because it
ensures effective collisions between the catalyst and the pollutant,
which, in turn, make sure that the reaction occurs. Also, regarding
the simulation, considering that the results resemble what is seen
in Figure 7, it is
possible to say that the simulation is accurate and effective in showing
a phenomenon that would need costly experimentation. Therefore, future
works could use it as a predictor of how the stirring speed will affect
the distribution of particles in the photoreactor that was designed,
and therefore, it could be used as a predictor of how the reaction
kinetics will be affected.

Conclusions
A photoreactor was effectively designed to evaluate the effect
of different variables, such as temperature and stirring speed, on
the photocatalytic degradation of phenol. The results obtained show
that depending on the characteristics of the available UV lamp such
as its wavelength, it is possible to select the correct glass material
to use in the photoreactor’s design. In this case, the concentration
of iron in Pyrex glass, which is a low-cost material, allows a high
light transmittance at the used wavelength (365 nm UV-A). Using this
type of glass, it was possible to obtain effective kinetic reaction
parameters for the photodegradation of phenol. The optimal reaction
parameters were a temperature of 318 K, a weight of 100 mg TiO2 (Degussa P-25), and a stirring rate of 475 rpm, which allowed
one to obtain a reaction rate of 0.0023 min–1. Finally,
the effect of stirring the reactor was explained through the computer
fluid dynamics simulation of a stirred static reactor with solid particles
using COMSOL multiphysics laminar flow and particle tracing models,
which show that when the reactor presents a laminar mixing regime
(stirring speeds lower than and equal to 475 rpm), as the stirring
speed increases, the homogeneous distribution of particles is ensured;
however, when the stirring speed is higher than 475 rpm and a turbulent
regime is introduced into the system, the distribution will not be
homogeneous, thus explaining the screening effect observed at high
stirring speeds in the experimental data.
