In this work we demonstrate the use
of Co(acac)3 in
combination with N-hydroxyphthalimide as an oxidant
for the selective α-oxidation of the representative β-O-4
linkages in lignin model compounds. The oxidation reaction proceeds
under mild conditions at 80 °C using 1,4-dioxane as the solvent
and an oxygen atmosphere. The prior α-oxidation in the β-O-4
linkage of the lignin polymer is known to result in an easier cleavage
of the adjacent C–O and C–C bonds because of a decrease
in bond stability. Finally, the conditions were successfully transferred
to kraft- and organosolv-lignin samples as proven by 2D-NMR (HSQC)
experiments and gel permeation chromatography measurements.

Introduction
The valorization of
biomass has become increasingly important in
various fields including the production of specialized materials and
fuels as well as in a biorefinery approach—producing bulk and
fine chemicals from renewable substrates.1 In this context, a promising resource is lignocellulosic biomass,
which is the most abundant raw material on earth.2 It can be obtained as a waste material from, for example,
the food production sector or directly harvested, which could potentially
be in conflict with agricultural areas.3 Lignocellulosic biomass is composed of three main components—cellulose,
hemicellulose, and lignin.4 The latter
one—lignin—is an amorphous macromolecule, which in nature
gives rigidity and protection to plants. It holds exceptionally high
oxygen-to-carbon ratios, thus making it interesting for the synthesis
of oxygenated chemical compounds.5 The
chemical structure of native lignin is highly complex and varies with
the plant type, its geographical origin, and age. Consequently, the
analytical investigation of lignin is a challenging task.6 To avoid this complexity, the majority of recent
studies makes use of lignin model compounds containing representative
binding motifs of the real lignin structure (Figure 1). Here, the β-O-4 lignin motif is
commonly addressed as it is the most abundant one in the polymer itself.7

Figure 1 (a) Structural overview of the lignin biopolymer and (b)
representative
lignin model compounds.

Various approaches for the depolymerization of lignin and
lignin
model compounds are known. They can be reductive or employ redox-neutral
catalysis,8 acid- or base-catalysis,9 and oxidative catalysis.10 For oxidative transformations, it was found that α-oxidation
of the secondary alcohol group in the β-O-4 motif in lignin
or in similar lignin model compounds decreased the bond strength of
the neighboring C–C and C–O bonds.11 Stephenson and co-workers validated this observation by
density functional theory calculations with respect to the cleavage
of adjacent C–O bond in β-O-4 model systems (Scheme 1).12 Along the same lines, Samec and co-workers utilized Pd/C
and glucose in EtOAc/H2O mixtures for benzylic oxidations
and showed that the catalytic cleavage of β-O-4 model compounds
was facilitated.13 A two-step oxidative
cleavage of simple monolignol-type β-O-4 lignin model compounds
employing VOSO4/TEMPO (2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidin-1-yloxyl)
in acetonitrile or methanol for the preoxidation step was reported
by Wang et al.,14 and Bolm and co-workers
employed HO-TEMPO under mechanochemical conditions for the oxidation
of the secondary hydroxyl group of β-O-4 lignin model compounds,
thereby facilitating the cleavage of the interconnecting bonds in
lignin to lead to a range of useful fine chemicals.15

Scheme 1 Oxidation Approaches of Lignin β-O-4 Linkages:
(a) Previous
Study by Stephenson and Co-Workers and (b) Proposed Approach in This
Work
Here, we describe the selective
oxidation of dilignol-type β-O-4
lignin model compounds and two lignin samples using a cobalt salt
in combination with N-hydroxyphthalimide (NHPI) and
oxygen to yield the respective ketones.

Results and Discussion
Our initial experiments for the Co-catalyzed oxidation involved
the use of β-O-4 lignin model compound erythro-dilignol 1a, which can easily be obtained on a large
scale in diastereomerically pure form.16 The first reactions were performed in analogy to the work by Ishii17 using acetic acid as the solvent at 100 °C
and 1 atm of dioxygen (Supporting Information, Table S1, entry 1). However, these conditions only led to a mixture
of the primary- and secondary acetylation products of 1a. A thorough solvent screening revealed 1,4-dioxane as the solvent
of choice, delivering 63% of the corresponding ketone 2a and 4% of the cleavage product 3a as determined by
high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis (Table 1, entries 1–3, and Supporting Information).

a Reaction conditions: 1a (0.25 mmol), Co(acac)3 (0.0025 mmol, 1 mol %),
NHPI (0.025
mmol, 10 mol %), dioxane (1 mL), and 5 bar O2 in a glass
autoclave.

i Reaction in a 25 mL

Following these
initial results, the time course of the reaction
together with the selectivity and activity at various temperatures
was investigated (Supporting Information, Table S1, entries 27–33). By performing the catalysis in
a glass autoclave instead of a reaction vessel, the oxygen pressure
could be increased to 5 bar, allowing for lowering the reaction temperature
to 80 °C without affecting the product yield (Table 1, entry 4). On a 1 mmol scale,
isolation of the products by column chromatography yielded 2a in 68%, 3a in 7%, and cleavage product 4 in 4%.

Lowering the reaction temperature from 80 to 60 °C
led to
a drop in catalytic activity, as expected following along the lines
of reaction kinetics, where a certain activation energy is necessary
(Table 1, entry 5).
At 135 °C, the formation of cleavage product 3a (29%
at full conversion) was favored and only 2% of ketone 2a was formed (Table 1, entry 6). Here, it needs to be mentioned that a complete change
in product selectivity was observed, which could be explained with
an increased activation barrier for the bond cleavage toward compound 3a. Under the given reaction conditions, this barrier can
only be reached at higher temperatures.

Extending the reaction
time from 16 to 24 h had only a minor effect
on the product yields (2a: 67%, 3a: 9%; Table 1, entry 7). Along
the same lines, a decrease in reaction time to 2 h led to only 3%
of the oxidation product 2a at a conversion of 7% (Table 1, entry 8). Hence,
a 16 h period was chosen for the subsequent optimization.

Next,
the effects of other catalysts were studied. Two representative
examples are shown in Table 1. Both Co(NO3)2 (entry 11) and Co(OAc)2 (entry 12) showed reduced activity toward the α-oxidation
product 2a, which underlined the importance of the Co(III)
species for the activation of the NHPI–O2 system.
Similarly, experiments with iron and copper salts led to a decrease
in both substrate conversion and product formation (for details see Supporting Information).

When the reactions
were performed in air, under an argon atmosphere,
in the absence of Co(acac)3, or without NHPI, the activity
of the system was strongly reduced to yield ketone 2a in <10% (Table 1, entries 13–16). Noteworthy to mention is that α-oxidation
of 1a toward ketone 2a also took place when
Co(acac)3 was omitted. However in that case, a stoichiometric
amount of NHPI was required in combination with molecular oxygen.

No oxidation products were observed when 2 equiv of TEMPO was added,
underlining the relevance of the most probably formed phthalimide-N-oxyl (PINO) radical derived from Co(acac)3,
NHPI, and O2. Additionally, using ketone 2a as the substrate under the optimized conditions led to a 27% conversion
and the formation of 3a in 8% yield. This result was
interpreted as evidence for the intermediacy of ketone 2a in the generation of 3a and 4 instead
of a direct conversion of dilignol 1a into such products.

With the optimized conditions in hand, lignin β-O-4 model
compounds 1b–h with different substitution patterns
and representing the higher steric demands present in the lignin biopolymer
were employed (Table 2). Compared to dilignol erythro-1a, its diastereomer
threo-1b reacted slightly less efficient providing 58%
of ketone 2a highlighting the small but detectable impact
of the changed steric environment (entry 1 vs entry 2). Also monolignol
model compound 1c and dilignols 1d and 1f with more electron-rich and sterically demanding substituents
reacted well leading to the corresponding ketones in yields of 63,
56, and 72%, respectively (Table 2, entries 3, 4, and 6). In comparison, model compound 1g with a 2,6-dimethoxy-substituted phenolic ether moiety
showed a lower activity giving the respective ketone 2e in only 48% yield (Table 2, entry 7). Presumably, the benzylic position became too crowded
leading to an inefficient oxidation of the secondary hydroxyl group
by the bulky PINO radical.

Table 2 Oxidation of Various
β-O-4 Lignin
Model Compounds with Co–NHPIa
a Reaction conditions: 1 (1.0 mmol),
Co(acac)3 (0.01 mmol, 1 mol %), NHPI (0.1
mmol, 10 mol %), dioxane (4 mL), O2 (5 bar), 80 °C,
and 16 h and yields (after column chromatography and given in mole
basis).

In line with previous
observations,18,19 model compound 1e proved unreactive and neither conversion nor product formation
was observed (Table 2, entry 5). Apparently, the presence of the free phenolic hydroxyl
group hampered the hydroxyl group oxidation, allowing a full recovery
of the starting material. Overall, these observations were rather
surprising considering that catalytic oxidations of this type of phenolic
lignin model compounds often lead to further polymerization reactions.
To our surprise, the same was true for dilignol 1h (Table 2, entry 8), which
had previously been converted to guaiacol and methoxy benzoquinone
under mechanochemical treatment using HO-TEMPO (Table 2, entry 8).15

After having established an overview on the reactivity of the Co-catalyzed
reaction system on lignin model compounds, the optimized reaction
conditions were applied on samples of the lignin biopolymer. Here,
a kraft-lignin sample (A) and an organosolv-lignin sample
(B) were tested. In each experiment, the sample size
of the respective lignin source was 200 mg to ensure an adequate concentration
for the analytical investigations. Although the catalyst composition
remained the same (1 wt % of Co(acac)3 and 20 wt % of NHPI),
the solvent amount was relatively increased (to 4 mL) to guarantee
a full dissolution of the biopolymer.

First, two-dimensional
(2D) NMR heteronuclear single quantum coherence
(HSQC) analysis was performed on the corresponding lignin samples
before and after the reaction. Therefore, the unreacted lignin samples
were directly dissolved in DMSO-d6, whereas
for the other samples, the solvent (1,4-dioxane) was first removed
in vacuo. Using the 2D NMR assignments by Sun and co-workers, the
signals of the aliphatic ether region (1H NMR: 2.0–6.0
ppm, 13C NMR: 42.0–92.0 ppm) were compared for the
native samples and those obtained after the cobalt catalysis.20

Figure 2 displays
this aliphatic ether region of the organosolv-lignin sample B. Apparently, both the resinol (Bα,β,γ)
and phenylcoumaran linkages (Cα,β,γ)
have remained mostly unaffected by the oxidative transformation. However,
an evident reduction in signal intensity for the Aα
signal of the β-O-4 linkages is visible, which is in accord
with the expected oxidation of the secondary hydroxyl groups of this
linkage in the lignin polymer. Moreover, the respective signals for
the oxidized β-O-4 linkage AO can be observed in
the spectrum after the reaction with values of 5.23 ppm (1H NMR) and 83.3 ppm (13C NMR). Unfortunately, the 2D NMR
HSQC spectrum of the kraft-Lignin sample A (see Supporting Information) does not show this characteristic
signal, which indicates that either no or only partial oxidation of
the β-O-4 linkages occurred.

Figure 2 Aliphatic ether and alcohol regions of
the organosolv-lignin sample
B before (I) and after (II) the reaction and (III) depicts the corresponding
bond motifs, labeled in the spectra as follows: β-O-4 aryl ether
linkage A, oxidized β-O-4 linkage AO, resinol linkage B, and
phenylcoumaran linkage C.

Second, gel permeation chromatography (GPC) measurements
were performed
for both lignin samples A and B (see Supporting Information, Figures S7–S12).
The respective elution volumes were calibrated with different standards
bearing fixed molecular weight distributions. Figure 3 shows the molecular mass distribution for
the organosolv-lignin sample B; here, three main regions
can be identified. For both the kraft-and the organosolv-lignin samples,
no significant changes of the molecular weight maxima (between 3000
and 3500 Da) were observed. Only differences around 50 Da are visible,
when the specific area is enlarged (Supporting Information Figures S9 and S12). In addition, both samples
showed a molecular weight Mw area of around
10 000–20 000 Da before and after the reaction
with Co(acac)3/NHPI. However, these high molecular mass
regions seem to strongly decrease in signal intensity after the reaction.
These findings are in line with the model compound studies because
only minor amounts of C–O and C–C bond cleavage products
could be observed. Along those lines, the small peaks at around 100
Da in the GPC spectra could refer to the cleavage of terminal β-O-4
bonds in very minor quantities but could also stem from remaining
amounts of NHPI or dioxane.

sample B before
(black line) and after (red line) the reaction.

Conclusions
In summary, a simple system for the oxidation
of lignin and lignin
β-O-4 model compounds was developed. As demonstrated for the
lignin model compound dilignol 1a, the optimized reaction
conditions involved the use of a combination of 1 mol % of Co(acac)3 and 10 mol % of NHPI under a dioxygen pressure of 5 bar in
1,4-dioxane at 80 °C for 16 h. Under these conditions, oxidation
of the benzylic hydroxyl group of a range of β-O-4 model compounds
occurred, affording the corresponding ketones 2 in good
yields. Alternative oxidations of the primary hydroxyl groups present
in the substrates were not observed.

Model compound 1e having a phenolic hydroxyl substituent
remained unreactive and was fully recovered. Although this result
was disappointing, it must not be considered as a serious drawback
for the devised catalysis because such phenolic fragments are mostly
present in the terminal segments of the lignin polymer, thereby representing
only a small fraction of the entire polymer.

During the conversion
of dilignol 1a, small quantities
of 3,4-dimethoxybenzoic acid (3a) and 1-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-3-hydroxypropan-1-one
(4) were identified. Most likely, these products stem
from a consecutive cleavage of ketone 2a, which indicates
that a subsequent decomposition of the β-O-4 linkages by altering
the catalytic conditions might be possible.

Finally, the optimized
reaction conditions were applied in the
oxidation of two different lignin samples: kraft-lignin A and organosolv-lignin B. Here, the oxidation of the
secondary hydroxyl group in the β-O-4 linkages was identified
by 2D NMR analysis. The signals for the other structural motifs remained
mostly unchanged. GPC analysis showed a constant molecular mass maximum
in both lignin samples. Only a small signal at lower masses was observed,
which is in accordance with the formation of minor amounts of cleavage
products in the model compound studies.

Experimental Section
Materials
and Methods
The used reagents were acquired
from commercial suppliers and used without further purification. Tetrahydrofuran
(THF) was dried by distillation over Solvona (sodium on molecular
sieves) in the presence of benzophenone. Dichloromethane (DCM), MeOH,
EtOAc, and dioxane were purified by distillation over boiling chips.
Thin-layer chromatography (TLC) analysis was performed using Merck
silica gel 60 F254 TLC plates. Flash column chromatography was carried
out with silica gel 60 (35–70 mesh). Catalytic reactions were
carried out in a Büchi “tinyclave steel” type
1/25 mL autoclave. Kraft-lignin sample A was directly
purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (#370959, CAS: 8068-05-1), whereas lignin
sample B was supplied by the “Fraunhofer-Zentrum
für Chemisch-Biotechnologische Prozesse” (CBP) Leuna,
Germany, using the organosolv method.

NMR spectra were recorded
on a Varian Inova 400 (1H NMR: 400 MHz, 13C
NMR: 101 MHz) or an Agilent VNMRS 600 (1H NMR: 600 MHz, 13C NMR: 151 MHz) spectrometer.

Mass spectra were recorded
on a Finnigan SSQ 7000 spectrometer
(EI,CI) and high-resolution mass spectrometry spectra were recorded
on a Finnigan MAT 95 spectrometer (ESI).

HPLC measurements were
conducted on an Agilent Infinity 1260 HPLC
apparatus using an Agilent Eclipse XDB-C18 (4.6 mm i.d. × 250
mm, 5 μm) column. H2O/MeOH (60:40) was employed as
the eluent and a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min was used.

GPC measurements
were performed on an ECO Sec System apparatus
(HLC-8320GPC) from TOSOH-Bioscience LLC Company with one precolumn
PSS Suprema (50 × 8 mm, 100 Å) and three PSS Suprema (300
× 8 mm, 100 Å) columns. A flow rate of 1 mL/min and an injection
volume of 20 μL were chosen. A Na2HPO4 buffer solution (pH 12) with 0.5 g of polyethylene glycol 6000 was
used as the solvent, and the signals were detected with an ECO Sec
RI detector.

General Procedure for the Catalytic Oxidation
of β-O-4
Lignin Model Compounds
The model compound 1a–h (1.00 mmol, 1 equiv), Co(acac)3 (3.6 mg, 0.01 mmol, 1
mol %), and N-hydroxyphthalimide (16.4 mg, 0.10 mmol,
10 mol %) were added into a 25 mL glass autoclave equipped with a
magnetic stirring bar followed by the addition of 1,4-dioxane (4 mL).
Next, the autoclave was charged with 5 bar of O2 and the
reaction mixture was stirred at 80 °C for 16 h and subsequently
cooled to room temperature. Next, a 1 M HCl solution (20 mL) was added
and the mixture was extracted with DCM (3 × 20 mL). The combined
organic layers were washed with an aqueous 1 M HCl solution (20 mL),
brine (20 mL), and water (20 mL). Drying over MgSO4 and
evaporation under reduced pressure afforded the crude material that
was further purified by standard column chromatography over silica
(DCM/MeOH gradient: 100:0.5 to 100:5).

General Procedure for the
Catalytic Oxidation of β-O-4
Bonds in Lignin Samples
Lignin sample A or B (200 mg), Co(acac)3 (2.0 mg, 1 wt %) and N-hydroxyphthalimide (40 mg, 20 wt %) were added into a
25 mL glass autoclave equipped with a magnetic stirring bar. Subsequently,
1,4-dioxane (4 mL) was added. Next, the autoclave was charged with
5 bar of O2 and the reaction mixture was then stirred in
an oil bath at 80 °C for 16 h. At the end of the reaction time,
the autoclave was taken out of the oil bath and cooled to room temperature.
The remaining pressure was released and the autoclave opened. For
GPC measurements, the solvent was removed under reduced pressure and
the solid residue was directly processed under the GPC conditions
(see Supporting Information). The respective
2D NMR HSQC measurements were performed in DMSO-d6 after the removal of the reaction solvent under reduced
pressure.
