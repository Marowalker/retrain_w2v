Phosphorylation at the intracellular
C-terminal domain (CTD) of
α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA)
receptors induces conformational rigidity. Such intracellular alterations
to the AMPA receptor influence its functional responses, which are
involved in multiple synaptic processes and neuronal signaling. The
structure of the CTD still remains unresolved, which poses challenges
toward providing a mechanism for the process of phosphorylation and
deciphering the role of each phosphorylation step in causing the resultant
conformational behavior. Herein, we utilize smFRET spectroscopy to
understand the mechanism of phosphorylation, with the help of strategic
point mutations that mimic phosphorylation. Our results reveal that
first, phosphorylation at three target sites (S818, S831, and T840)
is necessary for the change in the secondary structure of the existing
disordered native sequence. Also, the results suggest that the formation
of the tertiary structure through electrostatic interaction involving
one specific phosphorylation site (S831) stabilizes the structure
and renders conformational rigidity.

Introduction
α-Amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic
acid (AMPA)
receptors are a class of ionotropic glutamate receptors that mediate
excitatory synaptic signals across neuronal membranes.1−5 Neuronal transmission through AMPA receptor ion channels is responsible
for the development of memory and other cognitive functions.6−10 AMPA receptors undergo several extra and intracellular modifications,
which in turn modulate its functionality.6,11−14 Therefore, unraveling the mechanism of such modifications is of
enormous significance for the determination of appropriate drug targets
for several neurological treatments.15−18

Intracellular modifications
at the C-terminal domain (CTD) of AMPA
receptors are crucial to several synaptic processes such as long-term
potentiation,6,7,9−11,14 but a detailed structural
description of the CTD is not yet available. X-ray crystallography
succeeds in resolving the structure of all of the other domains of
AMPA receptors, barring the CTD, due to its inherent flexibility.19 Functional responses to the intracellular modifications,
such as phosphorylation, palmitoylation, etc., have been successfully
demonstrated with electrophysiological measurements.12,20−22 However, a detailed mechanism involving conformational
changes of the receptors, and their heterogeneous dynamics is yet
to be explored.

Previous studies have shown that Ca2+-mediated phosphorylation
at S818, S831, and T840 enhances the conductance of ions through the
AMPA receptor channel and is crucial to long-term potentiation.13,20−22 Furthermore, our previous study on a membrane proximal
section of the CTD showed that mutating the aforementioned three phosphorylation
sites with phosphorylation mimicking Glu residues introduces conformational
rigidity to the structure.23 In addition,
these studies demonstrated that such conformational changes were electrostatically
tunable, suggesting a mechanism that involves electrostatic interaction.
However, the mode of such electrostatic interaction and contribution
of each specific mutation toward conformational rigidity remain to
be explained.

Other work demonstrated that phosphorylation at
different sites
can have nonidentical functional responses, for example, S831 phosphorylation
directly enhances the function of the AMPA receptor by enhancing the
channel conductance.20,22,24,25 In contrast, S818 phosphorylation facilitates
the synaptic incorporation of AMPA.12,14 Thus, resolving
the effects of each phosphorylation toward the overall structural
changes of the CTD of the AMPA receptor is necessary. We speculate
that the phosphomimetic mutations at S818, S831, and T840 change the
secondary structure of the native sequence, and the structure is further
stabilized through the formation of the salt bridge between the negatively
charged Glu residues and nearby positively charged residues.23 In this study, we implemented a stepwise mutation
strategy that successfully indicated which phosphorylation site(s)
play(s) major role in the formation of a stable tertiary structure
possibly through the formation of the salt bridge.

Herein, we
used single-molecule Förster resonance energy
transfer (smFRET) spectroscopy to probe the conformational changes
of three different mutant variations of a 34 amino acid section of
the CTD, reported in our previous study.23 smFRET is a popular technique that has been extensively applied
to resolve the complex dynamics of biomolecules.26−33 By utilizing smFRET spectroscopy, we probed the conformational dynamics
explored by the three mutant variations. The results revealed that
phosphomimetic mutation at S831 is necessary for the electrostatic
interaction, which stabilizes the secondary structure of the CTD,
thereby rendering the conformational rigidity.

Results and Discussion
Phosphomimetic
Mutations are Turned Off Sequentially to Determine
the Role of Each Mutation in Rendering Conformational Rigidity
Figure 1A shows the
modeled full-length structure of the AMPA receptor, along with the
primary sequences of the native 34 amino acid section and the same
section with the three phosphomimetic mutations (E10E23E32). In the
E10E23E32 peptide, E10, E23, and E32 mutations mimic the phosphorylation
at S818, S831, and T840 residues of the AMPA receptor CTD, respectively.
It has been demonstrated previously that the formation of the salt
bridge is feasible between oppositely charged amino acid residues
that can result in a stable tertiary structure.32,34−38 In the case of the E10E23E32 peptide, there are positively charged
arginine (R7, R12, R29) and lysine (K5, K14) residues in the vicinity
of the negatively charged phosphomimetic Glu residues that can facilitate
such formations of the salt bridge. It is necessary to understand
exactly which phosphomimetic residue(s) can potentially contribute
to such formation, for two reasons. First, it will support the proposed
mechanism that the rigidity is a result of a change in the secondary
structure, followed by a tertiary stabilization. Second, it will provide
a deeper understanding of stepwise phosphorylation and will resolve
the functional responses of phosphorylation at each target. Therefore,
three different peptide constructs are chosen. On each construct,
one of the mutations is turned off by leaving the native amino acid
unmutated. Figure 1B depicts the primary sequences of the resulting mutants, E10S23E32
(E23 mutation is off), E10E23T32 (E32 mutation is off), and S10E23E32
(E10 mutation is off). All of the peptide constructs have a Biotin
tag at the N-terminal end to accommodate immobilization single molecules.
Furthermore, they are labeled with a FRET compatible pair of donor
(Alexa 555) and acceptor (Alexa 647) fluorophores at C3 and C34 for
enabling the acquisition of smFRET. Changes in the conformational
behavior in the absence of each of the three mutations are monitored
with smFRET.

E23 Mutation (Mimicking S831 Phosphorylation)
is Necessary for
Establishing Conformational Rigidity through Electrostatic Interaction
Denoised smFRET efficiency trajectories are histogrammed for each
peptide. The numbers of single-molecule trajectories analyzed for
each mutant and condition are included in the Supporting Information. Figure 2A compares distributions of the smFRET efficiency of
the three mutants with those of the previously reported23 native (blue) and E10E23E32 peptide (dark green).
The E10S23E32 peptide (light brown) explores a broad range of FRET
efficiencies similar to that explored by the native peptide and is
in contrast to the narrower distribution explored by the E10E23E32
peptide. On the other hand, the E10E23T32 peptide (purple) and the
S10E23E32 peptide (dark brown) explore a narrower range of conformations,
resembling that of the E10E23E32 peptide. All of the five peptides
exhibit >50% population in the high FRET efficiency range of 0.80–1.00,
indicated by the peaks appearing at 0.96 (native), 0.98 (E10E23E32),
0.88 (E10S23E32), 0.88 (E10E23T32), and 0.92 (S10E23E32). However,
similar to the native peptide, the E10S23E32 peptide explores several
other conformations corresponding to the intermediate and low FRET
efficiencies, ranging between 0.40 and 0.78. In contrast, the E10E23T32,
the S10E23E32 peptide, and the E10E23E32 peptide primarily remain
in the FRET efficiency range of 0.80–1.00. Table S1 in the Supporting Information shows the differences
in populations of each peptide distributed among region A (0.80–1.00)
and region B (0.40–0.78). Thus, the distributions of smFRET
efficiency show that the absence of the E23 mutation allows the peptide
to explore a broad range of conformations, similar to the native peptide.
It should be noted here that the distance between the probes can increase
beyond the FRET detection range, especially given the dynamic nature
of the mutants. However, all of the mutants are studied under the
same experimental conditions, and their dynamics are probed within
the same standard FRET efficiency detection region. Hence, the variation
of FRET efficiency for different mutants represents real dynamic conformational
behavior for these disordered structures. Furthermore, our previous
results with full-length NMDA receptor has shown that higher apparent
FRET efficiency (EA) values do correspond
to real distances obtained from crystallography data.39 Thus, we think that even our high EA values correspond to real conformational behavior and not
just the absence of the molecule in the sensitive FRET range. Figure S1 in the Supporting Information presents
sample trajectories and histograms for a portion of the NMDA receptor
protein having a well-defined structure measured using the same experimental
setup.39 This result shows that the trajectories
and histograms presented here reflect dynamics in CTD mutant conformations.
Moreover, the CTD does not exhibit a well-defined structure in the
protein crystallographic analysis, whereas all other domains of this
family of proteins are well defined.19,40 Thus, the
dynamic nature and lack of a defined conformation exhibited by the
CTD peptides are consistent with previous protein crystallography
studies19 and computational structure predictions.23

Figure 2 Phosphomimetic E23 mutation is necessary for conformational
rigidity.
(A) smFRET efficiency (EA) distributions
of the native peptide (blue), the E10E23E32 peptide (dark green),
the E10S23E32 peptide (light brown), the E10E23T32 peptide (purple),
and the S10E23E32 peptide (dark brown), under the standard buffer
(1×) condition, are depicted along with the corresponding primary
sequences. (B) Cumulative probability distributions of the CV of the
single-molecule trajectories are plotted for all five peptides. Inset:
zoomed-in on a section of the plot. Note that a faster CV decay indicates
a more rigid peptide, whereas a slower decay indicates a more flexible
peptide. The numbers of single-peptide trajectories analyzed are 84,
49, 76, 37, and 50 for the native, E10E23E32, E10S23E32, E10E23T32,
and S10E23E32 peptides, respectively.

The conformational flexibility or rigidity exhibited by the peptides
is quantified and compared using the coefficient of variation (CV)
analysis. As reported in our previous work,23 state assignment using vbFRET41 failed
to provide a reasonable solution to the smFRET data obtained from
the native and the E10E23E32 peptide. Similarly, vbFRET suggests best
fits at 21, 14, and 10 states for the E10S23E32, E10E23T32, and S10E23E32
peptides, respectively (Figure S2). This
result supports the dynamic nature exhibited by not only the native
peptide but by the phosphomimetic mutants as well. Furthermore, we
utilized 3D structure prediction algorithms, PEP-FOLD42 and Bhageerath,43 to obtain
structural information for the native and the E10E23E32 peptides in
our previous work.23 These algorithms did
not converge to one or a few most probable conformation(s) but rather
predicted multiple distinct conformations.23 Hence, CV analysis has been employed to quantify the conformational
fluctuations exhibited by the peptides. The CV of each smFRET trajectory
is calculated, and the cumulative probabilities for the CV of all
trajectories are plotted in Figure 2B. A steeper decay in CV corresponds to fewer overall
variations of smFRET efficiencies and, therefore, a more rigid conformation.
Conversely, a slower decay of CV indicates higher conformational variability
of the peptide. The decays of the CV plots corresponding to the native
and the E10E23E32 peptide set two extremes for the conformational
variability, with the native peptide (blue) exhibiting more conformational
flexibility and the E10E23E32 peptide (light brown) exhibiting less.
As the E23 mutation is present in both the E10E23T32 peptide (purple)
and the S10E23E32 peptide (dark brown), the peptides tend to be conformationally
rigid, almost resembling the E10E23E32 peptide. However, when the
E23 mutation is absent, the E10S23E32 peptide (light brown) shows
even higher flexibility than the native peptide. This behavior agrees
with the observation that the E10S23E32 peptide explores a broader
range of smFRET efficiencies than the native peptide (Figure 2A).

Further quantification
by the standard deviation (SD) analysis
supports the conclusion that the E23 mutation causes a narrower range
of conformations to be explored as compared to the native sequence.
The SD of each single-molecule trajectory is calculated, and SD distributions
incorporating all of the trajectories are plotted in Figure S3, for each peptide. The width of the SD distributions
and the SD values directly imply the variations of conformations explored
by the peptides. Figures 2A, B and S3 demonstrate that the
presence of the E23 mutation, with either of the other two mutations,
causes fewer conformations being explored, indicating a rigid structure,
as opposed to the flexible nature exhibited by the native and the
E10S23E32 peptide. Our results suggest that the E23 mutation is necessary
for the conformational rigidity of the structure, irrespective of
the presence of either of the E10 and the E32 mutations.

Variation of
the Salt Concentration Confirms that the Rigidity
Caused by the E23 Mutation is Electrostatically Tunable
In
our previous work, we showed that the conformational rigidity of the
E10E23E32 peptide-induced multiple phosphomimetic mutations is electrostatically
tunable.23 At a high ionic strength, the
charges introduced by the Glu mutations are shielded, and hence their
contribution toward the conformational rigidity are minimized, rendering
flexibility similar to the native peptide.23 Herein, we have implemented the same strategy to verify if the E23
mutation specifically is electrostatically tunable. This strategy
will verify if the formation of a tertiary electrostatic is taking
place through the E23 mutation, causing rigidity. In Figure 3, panels A, B, and C show the
primary sequences of the peptides (top), the corresponding distribution
of smFRET at increasing salt concentrations (middle), and the CV analyses
(bottom) of the smFRET data, for the E10E23E32, E10E23T32, and S10E23E32
peptides respectively. 1× represents the buffer solution containing
137 mM NaCl and 2.7 mM KCl. 2× and 5× represent buffer solutions
containing two and five times as much the NaCl and KCl concentrations
as in 1×. The E10E23E32 peptide loses its conformational rigidity
as the salt concentration is increased and gains flexibility similar
to the native peptide. The E10E23T32 peptide and the S10E23E32 peptide
also exhibit similar electrostatic tunability. At increasing salt
concentrations, distributions of smFRET of both the peptides become
broader, and the cumulative probabilities of CV show increasingly
slower decay. Thus, it is confirmed that shielding of the charge of
E23 weakens the electrostatic formation, thereby reducing the rigidity
and making the peptide flexible similar to the native peptide.

Figure 3 E23 is the
primary contributor to electrostatic tunability of conformational
rigidity. (A) Primary sequence (top), distributions of smFRET efficiency

salt concentrations (middle), and CV analysis (bottom) for the E10E23T32
peptide. (C) Primary sequence (top), distributions of smFRET efficiency
under varying salt concentrations (middle), and CV analysis (bottom)
for the S10E23E32 peptide. The salt concentrations are varied as 1×
([NaCl] = 137 mM, [KCl] = 2.7 mM), 2× ([NaCl] = 274 mM, [KCl]
= 5.4 mM), and 5× ([NaCl] = 685 mM, [KCl] = 13.5 mM). μEA and EA,max represent
mean and most probable smFRET efficiencies, respectively. The number
of molecules included in the analysis for each condition is mentioned
in the Supporting Information.

The native peptide retains its flexibility even at high salt
concentrations
as demonstrated in Figure S4, as this inherent
flexibility is not a result of electrostatic interactions. Similarly,
the E10S23E32 peptide does not lose its flexibility at a high salt
concentration. It is to be noted that unlike the native peptide, the
E10S23E32 peptide does have two negative charges at the E10 and E32
mutations. Yet, shielding those charges does not affect its flexibility,
thereby confirming that E10 and E32 are not involved in any electrostatic
interaction that controls the conformational flexibility of the peptide.
Thus, only the E23 mutation is directly involved in causing electrostatically
tunable conformational rigidity at the CTD.

Ensemble CD Measurements
Reveal that All Three Phosphorylation
Mimicking Mutations are Required for an Enhancement in the Secondary
Structure of the Peptide
Ensemble circular dichroism (CD)
spectroscopy is utilized to compare the secondary structures of the
peptides, and the results are depicted in Figure 4. It is important to note that the peptides are short and exhibit a weak CD
signal as they do not have the extensive α-helical or β-sheet
structure characteristic of a protein with a well-defined secondary
structure. However, the CD does indicate of the relative stability
of the peptides. The E10E23E32 peptide shows a stronger CD signal
compared to the native peptide, as reported previously,23 indicating that phosphomimicry enhances the
random-coil nature of the secondary structure of the native peptide.
CD signal intensities exhibited by all three mutants are still random-coil
like but are less ordered relative to both the native and the E10E23E32
peptides. This observation indicates that all three mutations are
necessary for a stronger random-coiled structure and supports the
first step of our proposed mechanism that phosphomimicry at all three
sites together leads to a substantial change in the secondary structure.

Figure 4 All three
mutations together enhance the secondary structure of
the peptide. CD spectra of the native (blue), the E10E23E32 peptide
(dark green), the E10S23E32 peptide (light brown), the E10E23T32 peptide
(purple), and the S10E23E32 peptide (dark brown), under standard buffer
(1×) condition, are shown. Only when all three mutations are
present, a stronger random-coiled secondary structure is observed,
as compared to the native peptide and the mutants containing only
two mutations.

At a high ionic strength, the
E10E23T32 and the S10E23E32 peptides
retain their secondary structure (Figure S5), even though they lose their conformational rigidity, as shown
by the smFRET data above. Such contradictory conformational behavior
indicates that high ionic strength, without affecting the peptide
structure, shields the electrostatic interaction, which stabilizes
the peptide in a rigid conformation. Thus, it validates the second
step of the proposed mechanism that the secondary structure gained
in the first step is stabilized through an electrostatic interaction,
involving E23, resulting in the conformational rigidity. Furthermore,
combined with the smFRET results, it is evident that even though the
E23 mutation along with either E10 or E32 does not enhance the secondary
structure, yet, those weakly random-coiled structures get stabilized
by the electrostatic interaction. Additionally, the E10S23E32 peptide
shows a weaker CD signal as compared to the E10E23T32 and the S10E23E32
peptides, indicating lesser random-coil nature in the absence of E23.
Thus, E23 is not only involved in an electrostatic tertiary stabilization
of the peptide but also plays an important role in strengthening the
secondary structure of the peptide.

Conclusions
Our
study provides direct experimental support to a previously
proposed mechanism23 for the phosphorylation
occurring at the CTD of the AMPA receptors. With the stepwise mutation
strategy, we have demonstrated that phosphorylation at all of the
three sites, namely, S818 (E10), S831 (E23), and T840 (E32), is necessary
for introducing a stronger random-coiled nature to the otherwise disordered
secondary structure of the native sequence. The secondary structure
is further stabilized by a possible tertiary structure formation through
electrostatic interaction involving only the phosphomutated S831 (E23)
site. This two-step mechanism provides a concrete explanation for
the electrostatically tunable conformational rigidity, introduced
by phosphorylation mimicking mutations at the above-mentioned phosphorylation
targets. We speculate that the conformational rigidity caused by phosphorylation
in the CTD causes the ion channel to stay open for longer, which enhances
the flow of the ion. The build-up of ion inside the membrane shields
the electrostatic interaction and brings back the conformational flexibility
leading to desensitization of the ion channels.

Furthermore,
our study distinguishes the role of phosphomutated
S831 (E23) specifically as the primary contributor toward the conformational
rigidity possibly through the formation of the salt bridge with nearby
positively charged residues [Arginines (R7, R12, R29) and Lysines
(K5, K14)]. Further studies on the single mutated S831 (E23) peptide
and substituted peptides (positively charged residues substituted
by neutral amino acids) are required for a comprehensive understanding
of the role of S831 (E23) mutation and the nature of the salt bridge.
Our findings further need to be correlated with similar experimental
investigations performed under a more physiologically relevant condition.
For example, a detailed study on the CTD within the full-length AMPA
receptor will elucidate how the conformation of the rest of the protein
and the conformational changes induced by phosphorylation affect each
other. Also, the CTD mutants are dynamic; computational structure
prediction algorithms fail to identify stable conformations.23 We think such dynamic yet functional peptide
structures offer a challenge for the development of future theory.

Materials
and Methods
Peptide Sequences and Labeling
Peptides were ordered
from Peptide 2.0 Inc. The native unphosphorylated peptide has a primary
sequence of EFCYKSRSESKRMKGFSLIPQQSINEAIRTSTLC
(native peptide).23 The underlined S indicates
C17S point mutation, which is a common strategy to prevent unwanted
Cysteine labeling by fluorophores.23,39,44 One Cysteine (C34) was also introduced to house another
label at the C-terminal end of the sequence. Thus, specific labeling
at both ends of the peptide construct was achieved. To mimic phosphorylation,
S10E, S23E, and T32E mutations were introduced, corresponding to the
phosphorylations at S818, S831, and T840 making the sequence EFCYKSRSEEKRMKGFSLIPQQEINEAIRTSELC (E10E23E32 peptide). Three other
mutant peptides were also studied, in each of which, one of the mutations
was turned off by leaving the native amino acid unmutated. The sequences
of these mutants are EFCYKSRSEEKRMKGFSLIPQQSINEAIRTSELC (E10S23E32),
EFCYKSRSEEKRMKGFSLIPQQEINEAIRTSTLC (E10E23T32), and EFCYKSRSESKRMKGFSLIPQQEINEAIRTSELC (S10E23E32). All of the peptides also had a biotin tag at the
N-terminus to allow immobilization through biotin–streptavidin
interaction. The peptides were dissolved in standard 1× phosphate-buffered
saline (Santacruz Biotechnologies; 137 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 10 mM
Na2HPO4, and 1.8 mM KH2PO4) and stored as 150 μM stock aliquots at −20 °C.

To label the peptides with a pair of donor–acceptor fluorophores,
Alexa 555 maleimide ester (Life technologies) and Alexa 647 maleimide
ester (Life technologies) were added to a 2–3 μM solution
of the peptides at a 1:1:4 concentration ratio of the peptides:Alexa
555(donor):Alexa 647(acceptor). C3 and C34, the only Cysteine residues
in the peptides ensured site-specific labeling with the donor–acceptor
fluorophores through the cysteine–maleimide interaction. The
labeled sample was left to equilibrate at 4–6 °C for ∼1
h. The resulting solution was then diluted to 2–3 nM with respect
to the concentration of the peptide, for immobilization.

Sample Chamber
Preparation
A detailed protocol for
the preparation of the sample can be found in previous publications.23,27,45 In brief, glass coverslips (no.
1, 22 × 22 mm2, Fischer Scientific) were sonicated
in acetone, soapy water, and Millipore water and then treated for
90 s in the TL1 solution composed of 4% (v/v) H2O2 (Fisher Scientific, Radnor, PA) and 13% (v/v) NH4OH at
75 °C. The coverslips were then washed with Millipore water and
dried with nitrogen. Next, they were cleaned for 2 min under O2 plasma (PDC-32G, Harrick Plasma). Plasma-cleaned coverslips
were then treated with Vectabond–acetone solution (2% vol/vol,
Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) for aminosilanization. PEG-BiotinPEG
solution containing 5 kDa mPEG succinimidyl carbonate (25% w/w, Laysan
Bio, in molecular biology grade (MB) water, GE Lifesciences), 5 kDa
biotin terminated PEG (2.5% w/w in MB water, NOF corp.), and sodium
bicarbonate (Sigma-Aldrich) was prepared. A silicone template (43018
M, Grace BioLabs) was placed on top of the coverslip to add the PEG-BioPEG
solution to a specific area on the coverslip. The PEG-coated coverslips
were left to incubate in a dark and humid environment overnight. Afterward,
excess PEG-BioPEG solution was rinsed off with MB water and dried
with Nitrogen gas. HybriWell custom chambers (43018 C, Grace BioLabs)
fitted with two custom silicone ports (460003, Grace BioLabs) were
placed on top of the coverslips to create a sealed chamber and to
allow the flow of the solution through it.

Protein Immobilization
A 0.2 mg/mL of the solution
of streptavidin prepared in 1× PBS buffer was flowed into the
sealed chamber. After 10 min, 2–3 nM of the labeled peptide
solution was added, followed by equilibration for 20 min and a subsequent
wash with a copious amount of the buffer solution, to wash off unbound
peptides and free dyes. For higher salt concentration experiments,
PBS buffer solutions with corresponding salt concentrations (2×:
[NaCl] = 274 mM, [KCl] = 5.4 mM; 5×: [NaCl] = 685 mM, [KCl] =
13.5 mM) were added, and the chambers were left to equilibrate for
10–15 min prior to acquisitions.

smFRET Data Acquisition
smFRET acquisition was performed
using a home-built confocal microscope described in details previously.27,45 Briefly, the excitation light was focused onto the sample via an
oil immersion objective (100 × 1.3 NA, Carl Zeiss) with a power
density of ∼50 μW/cm2. The emitted light collected
with the same objective was split by a 640 nm high-pass dichroic mirror,
(640 DCXR, Chroma Technology) to collect the donor and acceptor signals
at two avalanche photodiodes (SPCM-AQR-15, Perkin Elmer), separately
and simultaneously. Band-pass filters (NHPF-532.0, Kaiser Optical
Systems) were used to exclude the excitation light, tuning the light
to the emission ranges for donor and acceptor. Using a closed-loop
x-y-z piezo stage (P-517.3CL, Physik Instrumente), multiple 10 μm
areas were scanned and corresponding images were acquired, with both
532 nm CW laser (Compass 315M-100SL, Coherent) and 637 nm laser (OBIS-FP
637 LX, Coherent) to determine the locations of peptides exhibiting
FRET. Representative scan images are presented in Figure S6 in the Supporting Information. Peptide molecules
were then selected one by one, excited at 532 nm, and donor–acceptor
emissions were collected for each molecule. All acquisitions were
done in the presence of an oxygen scavenging and photostabilizing
buffer (ROXS) composed of 1 mM methyl viologen, 1 mM ascorbic acid,
1% w/w glucose oxidase, 0.1% v/v catalase, and 33% w/w d-(+)-glucose
(all from Sigma-Aldrich) in 1× PBS buffer. For higher salt concentration
experiments, ROXS was prepared in the PBS buffer containing corresponding
salt concentrations.

Data Analysis
Data processing and
analysis were performed
in MATLAB (R2018a, MathWorks). Donor and acceptor fluorescence emission
signals were collected from each single-peptide molecules.46,47 Apparent smFRET efficiency trajectories, EA(t), were calculated from the background
and cross-talk-corrected donor and acceptor fluorescence intensities
(ID(t) and IA(t) respectively) using eq 1, as given below.48,49 Apparent FRET efficiency, EA(t), is related to the actual FRET efficiency, EFRET(t) by eq 2, where ΦD and ΦA are quantum efficiencies of the donor and acceptor fluorophores,
respectively, and ηD and ηA are
the detector quantum efficiencies. For our experimental setup, (ΦDΦA/ηDηA) ∼ 1, thereby making EA(t) ∼ EFRET(t).45,49,50 Each apparent
smFRET efficiency trajectory (EA(t)) was processed using a wavelet denoising algorithm46,47 and was subjected to various checks to remove trajectories exhibiting
multistep photobleaching or an abnormally low signal to noise ratio.
Trajectories not exhibiting anticorrelation between the donor and
acceptor intensities were also discarded. The donor–acceptor
distances (r) were calculated from the apparent FRET
efficiencies (EA(t))
using eq 3, where R0 (= 51 Å) is the Förster radius
for the donor–acceptor fluorophores (Alexa 555 and Alexa 647,
Molecular Probes).45 1   2   3  Finally, all single-molecule EA trajectories (for a particular mutant) are combined
to generate the distribution of FRET efficiency values explored by
the mutant at each time point of those single-molecule trajectories.

Circular Dichroism (CD) Spectroscopy
CD spectra for
all peptides were acquired using a Jasco J-810 spectropolarimeter.
Native, E10E23E32 and E10S23E32 peptide solutions were prepared in
the PBS buffer at 75 μM concentration. E10E23T32 and S10E23E32
were prepared at 50 μM concentration. All five peptides were
prepared in high salt concentration buffer solutions as well. After
preparation, all of the peptide solutions were allowed to equilibrate
for 15 min at room temperature prior to data collection. Measurements
were conducted at room temperature, from wavelengths of 180–250
nm, with a scan speed of 20 nm/min, in a 0.01 cm quartz cuvette, using
20 μL of each solution. Data obtained in millidegrees were averaged
over 5 accumulations with a data pitch of 0.1 nm. Data in millidegrees
were then converted to molar residue ellipticity ([θ]) using
the equation  where θ is ellipticity
in degrees
reported by the instrument, l is the pathlength of
the cuvette in cm, N is the number of residues in
the protein, and c is the concentration of the protein
in g/cm3. CD spectra were plotted from 195 to 250 nm to
avoid the noise caused by the presence of salt below 195 nm.
