Binding
of metal ions is an important factor governing the folding
and dynamics of RNA. Shielding of charges in the polyanionic backbone
allows RNA to adopt a diverse range of folded structures that give
rise to their many functions within the cell. Some RNA sequences fold
only in the presence of Mg2+, which may be bound via direct
interactions or occupy the more diffuse “ion atmosphere”
around the RNA. To understand the driving forces for RNA folding,
it is important to be able to fully characterize the distribution
of metal ions around the RNA. In this work, a combined Grand Canonical
Monte Carlo-Molecular Dynamics (GCMC-MD) method is applied to characterize
Mg2+ distributions around folded RNA structures. The GCMC-MD
approach identifies known inner- and outer-shell Mg2+ coordination,
while also predicting new regions occupied by Mg2+ that
are not observed in crystal structures but that may be relevant in
solution, including the case of the Mg2+ riboswitch, for
which alternate Mg2+ binding sites may have implications
for its function. This work represents a significant step forward
in establishing a structural and thermodynamic description of RNA–Mg2+ interactions and their role in RNA structure and function.

Introduction
RNA serves many important
cellular functions, including information
transfer, catalysis, and regulation of gene expression.1−3 This functional diversity is due to the variety of structures that
the polynucleotide chain may adopt. Although the charge density of
a polynucleotide is high as every nucleotide bears a −1 charge,
RNA can adopt numerous distinct, compact folds that are important
for their biological function.4−6 Toward this end, metal ions play
an important role in stabilizing RNA folds by shielding the repulsive
backbone charges. In particular, divalent magnesium (Mg2+) is commonly bound to RNA, and some RNA fold only in the presence
of Mg2+.7−10 The role of Mg2+ in stabilizing RNA conformations includes
both indirect and direct interactions. The former involves Mg2+ occupying the so-called “ion atmosphere” around
RNA in solution,8 in which mobile ions
are not specifically bound to any RNA functional group, but they are
attracted by the electric field arising from the anionic RNA.11 Mg2+ in this environment may participate
in water-mediated, or outer-shell, interactions with RNA. Direct interactions
are associated with the high charge density of Mg2+ that
allows it to bind to RNA directly through inner-shell coordination,
including to tight turns in the RNA structure as well as simultaneously
ligating multiple phosphate groups in the RNA backbone, thereby directly
stabilizing specific folded conformations. To better understand the
role of these various Mg2+–RNA interactions on RNA
conformation, it is necessary to fully characterize the distribution
of Mg2+ around RNA.

The high charge density of Mg2+ that allows it to play
a central role in RNA conformation complicates efforts to study that
role on an atomic level. Identifying Mg2+ binding sites
on folded or unfolded RNA structures remains challenging, yet essential
for understanding the forces governing RNA folding, stability, and
biological function. Whereas directly coordinated Mg2+ can
often be resolved experimentally using methods such as X-ray diffraction
and solution NMR, diffuse and indirectly coordinated Mg2+ are more difficult to characterize. To overcome this, theoretical
methods hold great potential.

Previous theoretical efforts have
found limited success in reproducing
known crystal structure positions for Mg2+.12−15 These methods have relied on static structures, electrostatic surface
calculations, and/or continuum representation of solvent, thus ignoring
dynamics, ion correlation effects, and the influence of water structure
around the ions, including the corresponding configurational entropy
contribution. Thus, it is attractive to use more rigorous simulation
methods, such as explicit-solvent molecular dynamics (MD) simulations,
to evaluate RNA structures for possible Mg2+ binding sites
and to relate these binding events to subsequent local shifts in conformational
dynamics. However, there is a large activation energy for partial
desolvation of Mg2+,16,17 which makes sampling
the distribution of Mg2+ in and around RNA largely intractable
on the time scales typically accessible to traditional MD.

Toward
a greater understanding of the interactions of Mg2+ with
folded RNA, we present a theoretical investigation into the
distribution of Mg2+ in and around four structurally distinct
RNAs18−21 using a combined Grand Canonical Monte Carlo-MD (GCMC-MD) approach.22 The approach involves the use of explicit solvent
for both GCMC sampling of Mg2+ around folded RNAs and MD,
to refine the GCMC-identified ion distribution by allowing the RNA
structure and aqueous environment to respond to changes in the Mg2+ position. Use of GCMC overcomes the use of MD alone, as
exchange rates of Mg2+ coordinating water are on the order
of μs17 and exchanges of Mg2+ with anionic phosphate groups are on the ms time scale.23,24 The RNA structures used in this work represent a large range of
sizes (26–161 nucleotides) and a variety of tertiary structures
and contain both inner- and outer-shell Mg2+ coordination
by RNA functional groups, allowing an analysis of the competition
between fully and partially hydrated ions and the ability of the GCMC-MD
protocol to distinguish between both.

Results and Discussion
Identification
of Experimental Mg2+ Binding Sites
To address
the initial objective of assessing the ability of GCMC-MD
to reproduce experimentally identified Mg2+ binding sites,
we computed the occupancy of Mg2+ over the surface of the
four RNA structures. These occupancies were converted to “grid
free energies” (GFE)25 according
to G = −kBT ln(P), where P is the
probability of occupying a voxel (1 Å cubic unit of volume) on
the RNA surface relative to the voxel occupancy of the same species
in bulk solution, kB is the Boltzmann
constant, and T is the temperature (298 K). Thus,
the GFE provides a quantitative measure of the affinity of a given
species (in this case, Mg2+ ions) for different regions
across the RNA surface, which can be used to both evaluate the relative
affinity of known Mg2+ binding sites and predict new ones.
The GFE maps can be further discretized to identify Mg2+ binding sites using the so-called “Site-Identification by
Ligand Competitive Saturation (SILCS) pharmacophore” method
described elsewhere.26 Briefly, an energetic
cutoff value, −3 kcal mol–1 in this study,
is used as an upper limit to determine the most favorable regions
within the GFE maps, and the voxel GFE values are clustered to yield
cationic pharmacophore features representative of Mg2+ binding
sites. The GFE maps themselves can be used to score the experimentally
assigned Mg2+ sites as a way to evaluate the favorability
of these sites, as affinity for specific Mg2+ sites will
be different in a crystal environment versus in aqueous solution.

Figure 1 shows the
predicted binding sites for Mg2+ superimposed on the crystal
or NMR structures of each of the RNAs considered here, constructed
by discretizing the GFE maps shown in Figure S1 of the Supporting Information. Overall, the binding sites overlap
well with the experimentally identified Mg2+ sites (Table 1), including both
direct and diffuse binding, with few exceptions (discussed below).
On the basis of the minimum distance between each experimental Mg2+ position and predicted binding sites (Table 1), it is clear that that GCMC-MD approach
was able to identify the locations of Mg2+ ions at favorable
sites that coincide with the experimental assignments. The intervals
of MD refined the positions identified by GCMC, as can be seen by
comparing the Mg2+ maps from GCMC alone (Figure S2), which cover a larger portion of each RNA surface
and those generated during the subsequent MD simulations (Figure S1), which show more defined regions of
favorable occupancy. MD simulations from the same starting configurations,
without intervals of GCMC sampling, show only partial coverage of
experimental Mg2+ binding sites and sparse occupancy of
the occluded volume (Figure S3), consistent
with the slow exchange rates of Mg2+ discussed above.

Experimental Mg2+ positions were scored
in terms of
their overlap with the GFE maps to provide a quantitative estimate
of the relative affinity of Mg2+ for these sites. Figure 2 shows the scores
for each experimentally identified Mg2+ ion, and their
distances from the nearest predicted binding site are listed in Table 1. The scoring of the
Mg2+ positions indicates that nearly all of the experimentally
identified sites are favorable, with a few exceptions. An important
consideration in evaluating these results is Mg2+ coordination
between adjacent RNA molecules in the crystal structures. The four
peripheral Mg2+ in the BWYV structure are all mediated
by crystal contacts, and the 5′-terminal guanosine triphosphate
cap is artificial;21 thus, the occupancy
of these sites in aqueous solution remains an open question. Two of
these sites have favorable atomic GFE scores, −4.47 and −1.58
kcal mol–1, though the former will not be relevant
to the real BWYV pseudoknot as it is bound to the artificial cap.
Two sites are coordinated via crystal contacts21 and have unfavorable atomic GFE scores (+1.64 kcal mol–1), indicating that these sites are not likely to be
occupied in solution. One Mg2+ on the 23S rRNA19 has an unfavorable score of +0.22 kcal mol–1 and has no nearby predicted binding site (Figure 1C, top-left ion),
but given that it is coordinated between neighboring RNA molecules
in the crystal, it is unlikely to be relevant to Mg2+ occupancy
for RNA in solution. Similarly, the other two poorly scoring ions
(with scores of +0.22 and +1.64 kcal mol–1, respectively)
are not specifically coordinated by any RNA group, and thus, their
positions may reflect unique features of the crystal packing environment
that do not extend to a solvated state. Notably, the GCMC-MD comprehensively
sampled the major groove of the BWYV structure in the region occupied
by two Mg2+ ions that are bound only via interactions with
one RNA molecule of the crystal structure (Figure 1). One of these Mg2+ is known
to be critical for BWYV pseudoknot stability, as its dissociation
leads to unfolding.21 Its atomic GFE score
of −2.19 kcal mol–1 indicates that the GFE
maps correctly identify this site as being very favorable for interacting
with Mg2+. The VS ribozyme stem-loop VI structure was determined
using solution NMR18 and therefore does
not suffer from complications associated with crystal contacts. The
GCMC-MD sampling predicts that all of the experimentally identified
sites are favorable within the GFE maps, though two ions occupy regions
of comparatively weak affinity (−0.16 and −0.88 kcal
mol–1). Both of these sites are fully hydrated in
the NMR structure and interact primarily via water-mediated hydrogen
bonding to nucleobase atoms. These sites were not sampled at all during
a 100 ns unbiased MD simulation (Figure S3). The results of our relative affinity scoring are similar to those
obtained by Misra and Draper,27 who used
a series of nonlinear Poisson–Boltzmann calculations in continuum
solvent at varying salt concentrations to determine the affinity of
several experimentally assigned Mg2+ to an RNA hairpin
and the Escherichia coli 23S rRNA,
which differs by only one base (U1061A) from the Bacillus
stearothermophilus structure studied here. They found
that at 1 mM Mg2+, the free energy of binding for diffuse
ions bound to the 23S rRNA was on the order of −0.3 to −0.8
kcal mol–1. Extrapolating to 50 mM Mg2+ used in our GCMC-MD sampling, these binding free energies fall in
the range of −1 to −3 kcal mol–1,
in good agreement with the relative affinities we have calculated
in the present work.

GFE score (labeled) for the studied systems: (A) BWYV pseudoknot,

Predictions of Mg2+ Binding Sites
In addition
to reproducing the known Mg2+ binding sites, our GCMC-MD
approach uncovered additional regions on each RNA surface to which
Mg2+ can bind. Most of these are near known sites, but
in some cases they are completely new (Figure 1) and represent predicted sites with which
Mg2+ can favorably interact in solution to modulate RNA
structure and dynamics. This outcome is particularly evident in the
case of the Mg2+ riboswitch. Scoring the experimental positions
indicates that five of the six crystallographic Mg2+ sites
are favorable when compared to the GFE maps (Figure 2D); the final site was outside the defined
GCMC box and, thus, not sampled. The remaining sites all occupy what
is known as “core 1” of the M-box riboswitch structure
(Figure 3C),20,28 the region located closest to sequences that participate in terminator
or antiterminator helix formation and therefore most immediately responsible
for Mg2+-induced structural changes. Importantly, the GCMC-MD
sampling also indicates that Mg2+ can favorably occupy
regions of the riboswitch close to “core 3” (Figures 1 and 3C) that have previously been proposed using Mn2+ competition28 and phosphorothioate nucleotide
substitution experiments.29 Although occupancy
of these sites is not observed at all in the crystal structure,20 these additional locations may play an important
role in modulating the stability of the folded state and the dynamics
of the Mg2+ riboswitch under different Mg2+ concentrations
and therefore are predicted to be important to its function as a Mg2+ sensor.29 Wakeman et al.29 proposed additional Mg2+ binding
sites that were not identified in the Mg2+ riboswitch crystal
structure,20 including one coordinated
by Cyt89 and Gua91. GCMC-MD produced Mg2+ sampling near
these nucleotides, agreeing with their hypothesis based on phosphorothioate
substitution. However, whereas Wakeman et al. proposed that strong
interference at Ade101 and Ade105 was not likely due to Mg2+ binding, but rather steric clashes associated with the introduction
of sulfur into the backbone, we observe Mg2+ sampling in
this region. As such, putative coordination by Ade101 and Ade105 should
not be dismissed without further experimental evidence. Additionally,
our approach indicated that Mg2+ sampled a pocket with
considerable negative charge density formed by the backbone phosphate
groups of Ade60, Gua76, Cyt77, and Ade92 (Figure 3). In the crystal structure, the density
in this region (part of the interface between helices P4 and P5) is
assigned to a water molecule, with distances to the nearest nonbridging
phosphate oxygen atoms in the range of 3.0–4.4 Å. This
site could easily accommodate a partially dehydrated Mg2+ ion, as our sampling predicts. As the packing of helices P4 and
P5 against helix P2 is proposed to be important to the structural
change as a function of Mg2+ concentration,20 binding of Mg2+ at this newly identified
site may also be important for stabilizing the P4–P5 interface
during the structural interconversion of the Mg2+ riboswitch.

“core” Mg2+ binding regions of the M-box

In conclusion, we have
shown that by applying GCMC sampling in
combination with conventional MD simulations, it is possible to comprehensively
sample Mg2+ occupancy around complex RNA structures to
give a realistic picture of the thermodynamics of ion sampling around
RNA. The method produces both inner- and outer-shell Mg2+ coordination by RNA moieties (Figure S4) in agreement with experimentally assigned Mg2+ occupancy
using a computationally efficient additive force field model.30−32 By including MD simulations between intervals of GCMC sampling,
a fully dynamical picture of RNA–Mg2+ interactions
can be generated. The implications of these interactions on local
RNA dynamics are currently being investigated. Importantly, the present
study shows that it is possible to reproduce known Mg2+ binding sites and to quantify the relative affinity for these sites
in the context of solvated systems. Additionally, our approach is
the first of its kind in predicting new Mg2+ sites that
may be relevant to the RNA structure and dynamics in solution, an
outcome that previous methods and crystal structure analysis cannot
provide. This is particularly evident in the case of the Mg2+ riboswitch, which senses cellular Mg2+ concentration
to regulate the expression of Mg2+ transport proteins.
Whereas the primary region of sampling was in core 1, as in the crystal
structure, numerous additional sites throughout the central region
of the RNA structure were identified as putative Mg2+-binding
sites. As the shift in conformational ensemble in response to Mg2+ is directly related to its function in gene regulation,
these predictions merit additional study, particularly with respect
to the effects on dynamics. Whereas previous GCMC studies have focused
on highly ordered crystalline DNA systems33 or static, ideal structures in implicit solvent,34−36 the present
work is the first of its kind in addressing Mg2+ sampling
around RNA with an explicit solvent representation of the aqueous
solution and has achieved qualitative and quantitative agreement with
experiments, while simultaneously yielding new predictions for Mg2+ occupancy in solution under ambient conditions. We expect
that application of the GCMC-MD method to a wider range of folded
and unfolded RNA will yield critical insights into the stabilizing
forces of Mg2+ ions and provide a more complete thermodynamic
description of interactions between ions and nucleic acids. In addition,
given the limitations in the use of additive force fields for treatment
of Mg2+ due to the absence of polarization and charge-transfer
effects,37−39 we anticipate that force fields that include such
contributions may yield further improvements in the description of
Mg2+ distributions around RNA40 when combined with the presented GCMC-MD approach.

RNA Structures
The RNA structural models used in this
work, from both X-ray crystallography19−21 and NMR spectroscopy,18 are listed in Table 2. The structures chosen include both canonical
(helical) and noncanonical RNA structural elements, as well as both
inner- and outer-shell Mg2+ coordination. To prepare the
systems for GCMC-MD, all Mg2+ ions and waters present in
the initial structures were removed. Other ions (Na+ and
K+) were retained in their assigned positions, except in
the case of the Mg2+ riboswitch, which was capable of adopting
its folded structure in the absence of K+.20 For the VS ribozyme stem-loop VI solution NMR structure,
the first model (out of 20 in the NMR ensemble) was used. For the
23S rRNA fragment, the bound protein was removed because it has no
effect on the RNA structure19 and only
one RNA chain was used, as both RNA chains superimpose with <0.5
Å nonhydrogen atom RMSD. Os3+ ions identified in the
crystal structure were also removed as [Os·(NH3)6]3+ is used to mimic hydrated Mg2+ ions.

GCMC-MD Protocol
Parameters for RNA and ions were taken
from the Chemistry at HARvard Macromolecular Mechanics 36 (CHARMM36)
additive force field.30−32 The water model was CHARMM-modified TIP3P.41−43 All RNA molecules were centered in cubic boxes of sufficient size
to allow addition of 50 mM total [Mg2+] and neutralizing
Cl– ions. Mg2+ ions were inserted in
the GCMC exchanges in two forms in equimolar amounts: a “bare”
ion and a trihydrate, [Mg·(H2O)3]2+. Several preliminary simulations were conducted, and it was found
that bare Mg2+ (n = 0) as the sole source
of Mg2+ in the system led to excessive rejections of the
MC moves and inefficient sampling. This outcome was due to the small
size of the divalent ion allowing it to be placed in nearly any accessible
space in the simulation box, leading to a large number of rejections.
To overcome this problem, the insertion of hydrated Mg2+ was considered and tested. In principle, any hydrate (1 ≤ n ≤ 6, see Figure S5)
could be chosen as the species for GCMC sampling. A fully solvated
(n = 6) complex would prevent direct coordination
from being sampled and was too large to be efficiently inserted in
the GCMC sampling region. The trihydrate form (n =
3) was found to give good sampling and could participate in both direct
and indirect coordination. Results were not significantly different
with n = 2, 4, or 5, so the trihydrate was chosen
as the consensus representation of exchangeable, hydrated Mg2+ ions. The topology of the trihydrate was designed such that the
oxygen atoms of the coordinating water molecules were restrained within
2.1 Å of the Mg2+ ion, but no coordination geometry
was enforced, allowing the waters to reorganize in response to the
surrounding environment. In conjunction with bare Mg2+,
a reasonable acceptance rate (between 2 and 8% per species) was obtained
without needing to use an impractical number of GCMC steps.

GCMC exchanges were performed in 60 Å cubic boxes (sufficient
to cover the entire surface of the RNA) in the cases of the BWYV pseudoknot,
VS ribozyme stem-loop VI, and 23S rRNA. For the Mg2+ riboswitch,
the 60 Å cubic box encompassed the entire Mg2+-binding
region (cores 1 and 2, Figure 3C), as it was computationally intractable to sample the entire
surface of this large structure. GCMC sampling was performed using
a method described previously.22 In each
round of GCMC, 100 000 MC moves (insertions, deletions, translations,
and rotations) were attempted, evenly divided between all four species—bare
Mg2+, [Mg·(H2O)3]2+, water, and bare Cl–. For species with only a
single particle (bare Mg2+ and Cl–),
only insertions, deletions, and translations were attempted, as rotations
of these particles result in no change to the configuration. A GCMC
move was accepted if the energy of the generated configuration decreased,
or if the Metropolis criterion was satisfied, otherwise the move was
rejected. GCMC energy calculations were carried out using a simple
atom-based truncation scheme within 12 Å for electrostatics and
van der Waals interactions. As such, there is a small difference between
the energy evaluation between GCMC and the subsequent MD simulations
(see below). Because short-range electrostatic interactions are expected
to dominate interactions involving ions, the absence of long-range
electrostatics and the use of a hard cutoff for the van der Waals
interactions should not significantly influence the outcome.

For GCMC, the excess chemical potential (μex)
of each species was set to its hydration free energy (ΔGhydr). For bare Mg2+ and [Mg·(H2O)3]2+, the ΔGhydr values were determined using a free-energy perturbation
method described previously,44 yielding
values of −430.33 and −267.13 kcal mol–1, respectively. The full list of complexes for which the ΔGhydr values were determined is given in Table S1. During GCMC sampling, the μex values are allowed to oscillate by a set window (Δμex) to better drive sampling, therefore the method is more
accurately described as “oscillating-μex GCMC-MD”,
and the ensemble is “GCMC-like.”22 For the Mg2+ species and Cl– (μex = −79.4 kcal mol–1), Δμex was set to ±20 kcal mol–1, and for water (μex = −5.8 kcal mol–1) Δμex was ±2 kcal mol–1. We confirmed that this approach was valid by allowing
μex to vary freely in performing GCMC sampling of
bulk solutions of several [Mg·(H2O)n]2+ hydrates, targeting a concentration of 50
mM. As shown in Figure S6, these μex values converge to the value of ΔGhydr, confirming the robustness of our approach.

Following GCMC, MD simulations were conducted using Groningen MAchine
for Chemical Simulation (GROMACS), version 5.0.45 Nonbonded interactions were calculated using the Verlet
cutoff scheme,46 with a minimum neighbor
list cutoff of 12 Å. Short-range van der Waals forces were switched
to zero from 10–12 Å, and an isotropic dispersion correction
was applied to account for finite truncation of van der Waals interactions.
Electrostatic interactions were calculated using the smooth particle
mesh Ewald method,47,48 with the real-space contribution
to the Coulombic forces truncated at 12 Å. Bonds involving hydrogen
atoms were constrained using P-LINCS,49 allowing an integration time step of 2 fs. Periodic boundary conditions
were applied in all three spatial dimensions.

Before MD, the
configurations produced by GCMC were subjected to
steepest descent minimization, followed by 100 ps of NPT equilibration
at a temperature of 298 K and 1 bar of pressure, applying harmonic
restraints (k = 2.4 kcal mol–1 Å–2) to all RNA nonhydrogen atoms, as well as bound Na+ and K+ ions, if present. Temperature was regulated
using the velocity rescaling thermostat of Bussi et al.50 and pressure using the Parrinello–Rahman
barostat.51,52 Production simulations were carried out
for 500 ps under an NPT ensemble with harmonic restraints (also set
to k = 2.4 kcal mol–1 Å–2) on RNA phosphorus atoms and crystallographic Na+ or K+ ions, if present. Such restraints allow
for local flexibility of the RNA while still preserving the overall
tertiary structure, as the present study is focused on the distribution
of Mg2+ ions around the RNAs rather than comprehensive
conformational sampling of the RNAs. Similarly, the maintenance of
Na+ and K+ ions in the experimental locations
was to allow for sampling of Mg2+ ions into an environment
similar to that obtained experimentally, thereby facilitating comparison
of the calculated and experimental Mg2+ distributions.
During production simulations, the temperature was regulated using
the Nosé–Hoover thermostat53,54 and pressure using the Parrinello–Rahman barostat.51,52 For each run, 200 cycles of GCMC-MD were performed, and each RNA
system was subjected to 10 independent runs for a total sampling of
2 × 107 GCMC steps and an MD simulation time of 1
μs.

Map Analysis
Occupancy maps were calculated from the
distribution of Mg2+ around each RNA structure. The overlap
coefficient (OC) between occupancy maps is calculated as 1  where N is the number of
voxels in the GCMC region, and Qi1 and Qi2 are the occupancies of voxel i by fragments 1 and 2 (here, Mg2+ ions). The values of
OC range from 0 to 1, with 1 indicating exact overlap. The OC exhibits
nonlinear behavior, as even small differences in the maps result in
values of ∼0.8, whereas values >0.6 indicate strong similarity
(Figure S7). The OC is used principally
as a measure of convergence of the simulations; temporal and spatial
convergence of the OC were calculated from the first 100 and last
100 cycles in each run and the first and last five runs for each structure,
respectively, and are listed in Table S2. Given the similarity of the OC values during the first and last
half of each run, and across the 10 independent runs, the obtained
results are deemed adequately converged, such that 200 cycles of GCMC-MD
is sufficient for sampling each RNA system.

Binding Site Analysis
Using the SILCS pharmacophore
approach,26 the GFE maps from GCMC-MD were
discretized into clusters based on GFE, yielding predicted binding
sites. Predicted binding sites are derived by considering only regions
of the GFE maps more favorable than −3 kcal mol–1. The spherical SILCS pharmacophore sites have radii depending on
the number of voxels clustered together, with larger radii indicating
greater continuous regions of similar GFE values (Figure 1). To quantitatively assess
the agreement between experimentally assigned Mg2+ positions
and the predicted binding sites, we calculated the minimum distance
between the experimental position and the sphere centers along with
the atomic GFE scores (see above) of the experimental Mg2+ positions.

Atomic GFE Calculations
Scoring
of the experimentally
assigned Mg2+ positions in the field of the GFE maps was
carried out by assigning an atomic GFE value. The experimental coordinates
were overlaid onto the GFE map for a given RNA structure, and for
each Mg2+ ion, its distance to each voxel in the GFE map
was calculated. If the distance was less than 1.0 Å (the resolution
of the GFE maps), then the GFE score at that voxel was assigned to
the Mg2+ ion. Thus, the nearest GFE voxel describes the
favorability of the RNA surface for Mg2+ at a given volume
and does not represent the free energy of binding of a Mg2+ ion.

As three of the structures used in this study were resolved
using X-ray crystallography, such an evaluation is critical for understanding
differences in Mg2+ occupancy in the crystal environment
and in aqueous solution. It is important to note that these scores
are not absolute free energies of binding at these locations, rather
they are relative affinity scores based on the overlap of a single
point in space with the GFE maps. Calculating the absolute binding
free energy of Mg2+ to complex, folded RNA is a considerable
challenge due to the heterogeneity of interactions in the bound state
and is beyond the scope of this work.
