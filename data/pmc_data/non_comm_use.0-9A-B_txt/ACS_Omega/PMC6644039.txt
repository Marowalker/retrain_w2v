Gum arabic (GA),
the dried
exudates of Acacia seyal and Acacia senegal trees, being a biopolymer, has found
many applications in the food, pharmaceutical, cosmetic, and lithography
industries. GA, a water-soluble food hydrocolloid, is a complex and
variable mixture of arabinogalactan oligosaccharides, polysaccharides,
and glycoproteins. It has been a subject of great interest and a wide
range of research has been done on the polysaccharide structural aspects
and the emulsifying properties only. In the present study, fluorescence
spectral technique is employed as an analytical tool to understand
the photophysics of GA. The tyrosine microenvironment of GA was explored
by studying the steady-state absorption, emission, fluorescence lifetime,
and three-dimensional (3D) emission contour spectra of GA at various
pH conditions in aqueous solution. The multiple emissive states are
attributed to the presence of intrinsic fluorophore tyrosine in a
heterogeneous microenvironment. The study portrays the multicharacteristic
behavior of tyrosine in various pH conditions and in different microdomains.
The exposure of the buried tyrosine to the heterogeneous aqueous phase
was authenticated by 3D emission contour spectral studies. An interesting
visualization of tyrosine involving in hydrogen-bonding network with
another tyrosine moiety at neutral pH was ascertained. The coexistence
of hydrophilic carbohydrate and hydrophobic protein in GA enables
its emulsification and stabilization properties. Hence, any advancement
toward understanding the protein microenvironment of GA is of great
significance for chemists, as the molecular modeling and biosynthesis
of the gum with desired end product are underway in many research
institutes.

1 Introduction
Gum arabic (GA), the dried exudates of Acacia seyal and Acacia senegal trees, being a
biopolymer, has found many applications in food, pharmaceutical, cosmetic,
and lithography industries.1 GA is desirable
for its emulsifying, stabilizing, binding, and shelf-life enhancing
properties. Current literature suggests its cardio-, reno-, gut-,
and dental-protective; satiety-inducing; antimicrobial; anti-inflammatory;
and anticoagulant implications, which makes GA one of the best food
hydrocolloids. Its foray into drug delivery, sensor, tumor imaging,
and nanotechnology has met with appreciable success, fueling further
investigation into its unexplored functionality.2 GA is a highly branched, neutral, or slightly acidic, polysaccharidic
complex, containing about 2% of polypeptide. Extensive research on
the composition, structure, and conformation of GA has been reported
in the literature.3−9 In general, three main
fractions have been isolated by hydrophobic interaction chromatography.5b The three fractions are arabinogalactan—peptide
or AG, arabinogalactan—protein or AGP, and glycoprotein or
GP. The fraction (F) 1 (AG) is a thin oblate ellipsoid, branched disklike
structure.8 The branches are mainly composed
of 1,3-linked β-d-galactopyranosyl units with 1,6-linked
β-d-galactopyranosyl side chains to which many arabinosyl,
uronic acid, and rhamnose residues are linked,8−10 where the 43 amino acid residue peptide
sequence was supposed to be totally buried. Fraction 2 (AGP) is a
linear chain with branched building blocks closely resembling the
wattle blossom model.12 The AGP consists
of short arabinose side chains and much larger blocks of highly branched
carbohydrates,13 linked to a polypeptide
chain possibly containing approximately 250 amino acids, and the molecule
adopts a very compact conformation with a radius of gyration (Rg) of 36 nm. Fraction 3 (GP) consists of spheroidal
ringlike monomers of hydroxyproline–arabinogalactan (AG) subunits
and more anisotropic oligomers resulting from monomer self-association.
The compositions of the various fractions of GA are well established
in the literature11−14 and are provided in Table 1.

GA has been a subject of great interest,
and a wide range of research has been done on the structural aspects
and the emulsifying properties only. The photophysical studies of
GA were found to be very less in the literature. A valuable feature
of intrinsic protein fluorescence is the high sensitivity to its local
environment. Changes in the emission spectra often occur in response
to conformational transitions, subunit association, substrate binding,
or denaturation.15 Hence, valuable information
about the protein microenvironment can be obtained through photophysical
studies. Since the biosynthesis of the gum using biotechnological
methods is of great interest, fluorescence spectroscopy can be applied
as a tool to probe the microenvironment within the macromolecule.16

In our present study, we have recorded
absorption, emission, fluorescence lifetime, and three-dimensional
(3D) emission contour studies of GA in various pH conditions by buffering
the medium using the universal Britton and Robinson buffer solution.
The variation in the microdomains of the intrinsic fluorophore was
ascertained by fluorescence spectral techniques.

2 Results and Discussion
The three main
fractions of GA have been isolated, analyzed, and reported in the
literature.11−14 Each fraction contained similar proportions
of the various sugars and differed essentially in their molecular
masses and protein contents,8 as provided
in Table 1. The AGP
and GP fractions of GA constitute to about 10.3 and 1.3% by total
weight, and the protein contents were 9 and 24.6%, respectively. Earlier
reports convey that these two fractions do exhibit fluorescence, but
the origin of fluorescence was not emphasized. The AG fraction makes
up to 88% of the total gum, made mostly of sugars and has the least
protein content (1.1%) but does not exhibit any fluorescence property.
All of the three fractions have similar sugar units and differ only
in the protein content, which clearly reveals that the observed fluorescence
for GA is not due to the sugar moieties but due to the protein content
of AGP and GP fraction.

GA amino acid composition has been reported
in the literature,13 and the compositions
of fluorescing amino acids like phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan
were found to be 6.33, 2.38, and 0 mol mg–1 respectively.
It is well known that tyrosine and tryptophan amino acids dominate
the emission of most proteins compared to phenylalanine, which generally
shows weak absorption and emission spectra at 260 and 282 nm, respectively.15 Tryptophan being absent in GA, the observed
absorption and fluorescence spectra at 278 and 315 nm were ascribed
predominantly to the tyrosine moieties only. The observations we made
through all of the spectral studies are discussed in detail.

2.1 Absorption Spectral Studies
The absorption spectrum was measured for GA as such and for buffered
solution of GA at various pH conditions. The absorption spectrum of
GA exhibits a maximum at 278 ± 2 nm, which is correlated to tyrosine
amino acid.15 As the pH of the medium was
increased, the absorption maximum at 278 nm showed a slight increase
in the absorbance along with a significant red shift, which is apparent
in the normalized absorption spectrum of GA at different pH conditions
(Figure 1). The observation
is in accordance with the behavior of l-tyrosine amino acid
in basic pH conditions, reported in the literature.17,18 Tyrosine
can form ground-state complex with weak base near neutral pH, leading
to the formation of tyrosinate anion.15 The Britton and Robinson buffer furnishes acetate and phosphate
ions. Hence, the reason for red shift in the absorption maximum is
the formation of a ground-state complex between tyrosine and the weak
bases in the medium. The pKa of the aromatic
hydroxyl group in tyrosine is 10 in the ground state. At pH 11.1 (pH
> pKa), there is a clear red shift
(278–293 nm) in the absorption maximum, indicating the formation
of tyrosinate anion. To achieve pH 11.1, 0.2 M sodium hydroxide was
used, while for all of the other pH conditions, Britton and Robinson
buffer solution was used.

GA (5.71 × 10–6 M) at various pH conditions.

2.2 Fluorescence Spectral Studies
The fluorescence spectrum
of GA exhibits a maximum at 315 ± 3 nm, a slight hump at 320
nm, and a broad shoulder from 390 to 450 (Figure 2). The observed fluorescence in GA is attributed
to tyrosine moieties.15 At pH 2.18, the
emission peak at 315 nm is blue-shifted to 311 nm, the hump at 320
nm decreases in intensity, while there is an increase in the intensity
of the emission peak at 450 nm. It is well known that in acidic medium,
the polysaccharides undergo cleavage at the glyosidic linkages forming
mono-, di-, and oligosaccharides, and a similar phenomenon is reported
for GA19 in dilute acids. Hence, a polysaccharide
breakdown into minor units at pH 2.18 is presumed; in the process,
the buried polypeptide is exposed to the aqueous phase. There are
several reports signifying that protein-containing fluorescing amino
acids on denaturation usually exhibit more than one emission apart
from the native emission. An emission above 400 nm along with a high
fluorescence lifetime results for many protein molecules on denaturation,
which confirm the existence of fluorescing amino acids in a heterogeneous
environment.15,20−22 This, in general, is correlated to the presence
of tryptophan moieties, and in our studies, tryptophan moieties being
absent, the peak at 450 nm is attributed entirely to the exposure
of tyrosine amino acids to the aqueous phase. A similar behavior is
observed at various pH conditions, and exposure of tyrosine to the
aqueous phase has occurred to varying extents, which is visualized
by the change in the intensity of the emission peak at 450 nm. Maximum
exposure of the peptide to the aqueous phase is observed at pH 9.20.
In strong basic conditions, polysaccharides undergo a haphazard fragmentation
into glycolic aldehyde, trioses, tetroses, formaldehyde, and glycolic
acid. Such a happening in GA exposes the peptide to a greater extent
to the aqueous phase at pH 9.20. The hump at 320 nm (Figure 2) is more prominent above pH
3.4. The pKa of the aromatic hydroxyl
group in tyrosine is around 10.0 in the ground state but decreases
to around 4–5 in the excited state. At pH above 5, the hydroxyl
group dissociates or involves in hydrogen bonding during the lifetime
of the excited state.15 Emission bands
in the wavelength range (320–350 nm) have been assigned to
tyrosinate, formed in the excited state by proton transfer from tyrosine
to a proton acceptor23,24 or to a hydrogen-bond tyrosine
complex.25 At pH 5.5, the peak at 315 nm
shifts completely to 334 nm, and the red shift of the peak is an indication
of increased tyrosinate character. The shift in the hump at 320 nm
at various pH conditions will be discussed in detail in Section 2.4 with the help
of 3D emission contour spectra and Figure 2A.

(A) Plot of pH vs fluorescence intensity of GA at 450, 311, and 334
nm. (B) Emission spectrum of GA (2.86 × 10–6 M) at pH 7.04.

At pH 7.04, an interesting fluorescence
pattern is observed (Figure 2B). Three distinct peaks are observed at 314, 333, and 450
nm. A unique and a prominent dip is seen at 317 nm. Several slight
humps are observed at 320, 350, and 362 nm.

Such occurrence
of doublets (314 and 333 nm) are more probable for dimerization of
fluorophore and inter- or intramolecular hydrogen bonding.26 To get a better knowledge about the ground-state
and excited-state properties and the microenvironment of the intrinsic
fluorophore at pH 7.06, 3D emission contour spectral studies were
performed. The results are discussed in Section 2.4.

2.3 Fluorescence Lifetime Studies
The fluorescence decay
of aqueous solution of GA at various pH conditions such as 3.24, 4.63,
5.51, 6.22, 7.81, and 9.44 were measured. The excitation wavelength
was fixed at 280 nm, and the decay at wavelengths 315, 335, and 450
nm were followed. The fluorescence decay of GA is triexponential at
all pH conditions. The decay for GA in various pH conditions at 315
nm is shown in Figure 3 and its corresponding decay analysis is provided in Table 2. At pH 3.24, the lifetimes
of the three components are 0.31, 0.94, and 2.13 ns and the relative
amplitude percentages are 6, 86, and 9%, respectively. The second
component has the highest relative amplitude percentage (86%) with
a lifetime of 0.94 ns. As the pH of the medium was increased, τ2 gradually increases while A2 gradually
decreases to about 1.45 ns and 35%, respectively. The fluorescence
decay analysis at 450 nm is shown in Table 3. At pH 3.24, all of the three components
have increased lifetimes (in comparison to 315 nm) of 0.98, 2.74,
and 9.54 ns and relative amplitude percentages are 51, 35, and 15,
respectively. Here, A2 is 35% and the
percentage increases as the pH increases to about 55% at pH 9.44.
The observation clearly reveals that the component which was once
emitting at 315 nm, as the pH of the medium is becoming more and more
basic, is increasingly emitting at 450 nm. At 450 nm, all of the components
at different pH values show an increased lifetime values compared
to those at 315 nm. The fluorescence decay and decay analysis at 335
nm are given in the Supporting Information (Figure S1 and Table S1), where one can
see the lifetimes of all of the three components showing a steady
increase with the increase in pH, while not much change in the amplitude
distribution was observed. The decay chart and decay analysis at constant
pH and varying wavelength is given in the Supporting Information (Figures S2–S4 and Tables S2–S4), which again clearly reveal the formation of
high lifetime species (apparent in τ3) at higher
pH conditions, and the shift of the A2 component from 315 to 450 nm at high pH conditions is apparent.

It is well known that tyrosine and tryptophan in proteins exhibit
high lifetimes when exposed to an heterogeneous environment in the
presence of denaturants. This is attributed to the presence of hydrophilic,
hydrophobic, or charged species surrounding the fluorophore.15,27 The breakdown of GA, which is a carbohydrate protein complex, leads
to the exposure of sugars and amino acids, creating an heterogeneous
population. Hence, as observed in our studies, the increased lifetimes
for τ2 and τ3 (Table 3) and the trend in the amplitude
distribution ascertain the exposure of the intrinsic fluorophore in
GA to the heterogeneous environment. The fluorescence decay analysis
supports the observed emission spectrum very well. At pH 4.63 and
5.51 (Table 2), A1 is a negative value, which indicates an excited-state
process. As stated earlier, the pKa of
tyrosine in the excited state is between 4 and 5; hence, the negative
value reflects the formation of tyrosine–weak base hydrogen-bond
complex or tyrosinate ion in the excited state at pH 4.63 and 5.51.
The observation is supported by the shift (311–334 nm) in emission
spectrum (Figure 2),
which is more prominent in (Figure 2A). While for pH values 6.22, 7.06, and 9.44, no such
negative components (Table 2) are observed, which is supported by the absorption spectrum
that shows no red shift in the absorption maximum until pH 4.37, but
for pH ≥ 6.20, there occurs a red shift, which increases as
pH increases, indicating the ground-state formation of tyrosine–weak
base hydrogen-bond complex or tyrosinate ion. The average lifetime
of GA in various pH conditions at 315, 335, and 450 nm were 1.23,
1.52, and 3.19 ns respectively. The lifetimes of l-tyrosine
amino acid and phenylalanine as reported in the literature are 3.1
and 6.8 ns, respectively.15 In the present
study, GA (unbuffered) emits predominantly at 315 nm, which corresponds
to tyrosine moieties in the bound state, with a decay time of 1.23
ns. At pH 9.44, the tyrosine moieties exposed to aqueous phase emit
at 450 nm with an average decay time of 3.19 ns, which corresponds
to that of free l-tyrosine. The observed lifetimes for GA
authenticate the predominant fluorophore to be tyrosine only.

2.4 Three-Dimensional (3D) Emission
Contour Spectral Studies
The 3D emission contour spectra
of GA at different pH conditions manifest the presence of multiemissive
environment. In the contour spectra of unbuffered GA (Figure 4A), two major regions are observed.
The first region (R1) corresponds to the excitation centered at 280
nm and emission centered at 315 nm. The second region (R2) corresponds
to the excitation centered at 280 and around 340 nm and a broader
emission at 450 nm. Both the regions R1 and R2 are populated to varying
extents depending on the pH of the medium. For unbuffered GA, R1 shows
a strong fluorescence intensity and R2 shows a weak fluorescence intensity.
On closer examination of R1 (Figure 4A), one could see that there is a separation of two
minor segments within R1, one at 310 nm and the other at 330 nm (emission
wavelengths). We observe that the two segments within R1 are being
populated to varying extents at various pH conditions.

(3D) emission contour spectrum of GA at pH 9.20. (F) Three-dimensional
(3D) emission contour spectrum of GA at pH 7.04.

At pH
2.18 (Figure 4B), maximum
intensity is at 310 nm supporting the emission spectrum observed for
pH 2.18 (Figure 2).
For pH values 3.20, 4.46, and 5.51, the segment at 310 nm gradually
decreases in intensity, and at pH 6.22 (Figure 4C), the segment eventually vanishes and only
a single segment is observed centered at 332 nm. The observation supports
the red shift (310–335 nm) observed in the normalized emission
spectrum (Figure 2).
The pKa of tyrosine in the excited state
is in the range 4–5. At low pH (2.18), the aromatic hydroxyl
group has the least ability to dissociate or involve in hydrogen bonding
with other amino acids in the vicinity or with the aqueous phase.
Hence, the segment at 310 nm is predominant in R1 at pH 2.18. As the
pH of the medium increases, the ability of the tyrosine to dissociate
or to involve in hydrogen bonding also increases, which results in
the decrease of intensity of the segment at 310 nm, and a new segment
gradually appears and dominates R1 at pH above the pKa of tyrosine in the excited state, which is 6.22. A plot
of pH versus normalized fluorescence intensity (Figure 2A) supports our discussion. At 311 nm (Figure 2A), the maximum fluorescence
intensity is observed for pH 2.18, and the intensity decreases as
the pH of the medium increases to 6.22. The opposite is observed at
334 nm, where the fluorescence intensity increases with the increase
in pH. As we study the contour spectra at the high pH conditions,
such as pH 8.43 (Figure 4D) and pH 9.20 (Figure 4E), one should expect to observe only one segment at 330 nm in R1;
on the contrary, the segment at 310 nm continues to be present in
minor intensities from pH 7.04 to 9.20. This contradiction can be
explained considering the after effects of fragmentation of GA. As
discussed earlier, on fragmentation, GA shows an unusual fluorescence
at 450 nm due to the exposure of the fluorescing amino acids to a
heterogeneous environment. The region R2 corresponds to the fraction
of the amino acids completely exposed to the aqueous phase. Hence,
observing the R2 of all of the contour spectra, we conclude that the
extent of fragmentation of GA is directly proportional to the increasing
strengths of base and also with increasing strengths of acid. The
trend in fragmentation is clearly evident in Figure 2A at 450 nm. The plot clearly reveals the
ratio of fluorescence intensities at 311 and 450 nm for various pH
conditions, which again ascertains the maximum exposure of tyrosine
to the aqueous phase at pH values 2.18 and 9.44. So, on fragmentation,
it is now evident that a portion of the polypeptide in GA is exposed
while there still exists a portion of polypeptide that is not completely
exposed to the aqueous phase. The fragmented sugar units surround
the still buried polypeptide, further decreasing its ability to access
the aqueous phase and hence the reason for the feeble appearance of
the segment at 310 nm in R1 (pH 7.04–9.20). It is also supported
by the increase in fluorescence intensity at 311 nm for pH 9.20 (Figure 2A).

At pH 7.04
(Figure 4F), a unique
contour spectrum was observed. The emission spectrum (Figure 2) also recorded a doublet-like
spectrum, which is observed as a (Figure 2A) sudden increase in fluorescence intensity
at 311 nm for pH 7.04. The segment at 335 nm in R1 (Figure 4F) was further split into two
major segments, for which the excitation wavelength was centered at
270 and 290 nm, respectively, while the emissions for both the segments
were centered at 335 nm only. There was also a minor region coexisting
at 310 nm, which is attributed to the buried tyrosine units. The doublet-like
emission pattern and the split-up contour can be regarded due to the
dimerization of the fluorophore at the first glance. Tyrosine dimers
are reported to emit in the form of doublets or triplets in the region
around 420 nm,26 and the extensive red
shift (monomer 305 nm to dimer 420 nm) is said to occur due to long-range
delocalization of the π electrons in Tyr-O-O-Tyr. In the present
study, a doublet-like observation was made around 350 nm; hence, the
formation of tyrosine dimers can be ruled out. The possibility for
excimer formation is also ruled out, as the contour spectrum clearly
displays two different excitation wavelengths 270 and 290 nm for the
doublet, which confirms that the species are formed in the ground
state and also the lifetime data had no negative components at pH
7.05. Further, the doublet-like contour and emission spectrum are
observed only at pH 7.05. If the observation is due to a single tyrosine–weak
base hydrogen-bonding complex, then a similar contour spectrum is
expected to occur even at pH 8.43 and 9.44. Such a contour spectrum
was not observed for pH 8.43 and 9.44. Hence, we conclude that at
neutral pH, the water molecule, which is capable of acting as a proton
donor and acceptor, has formed a hydrogen-bonding network (HBN) connecting
two tyrosine moieties displaying a doublet-like emission and contour
spectrum. Tyrosine A (Tyr A, Scheme 1) acts as a proton donor in the HBN and corresponds
to the excitation wavelength of tyrosinate ion (290 nm).15 Tyrosine B (Tyr B) acts as a proton acceptor
in the HBN and corresponds to the excitation wavelength of tyrosine
(270 nm). Tyrosine moieties when present as a part of monomeric units
have a greater probability to form HBN, and such monomeric units are
said to be present in the glycoprotein fraction of GA.14 Hence, the formation of tyrosine HBN in the
GP fraction of GA is supposed rather than the AGP fraction, where
the polypeptide is buried inside the polysaccharide mesh.

3 Conclusions
The
photophysics of GA was explored by studying its steady-state absorption,
emission, fluorescence lifetime, and 3D emission contour spectra at
various pH conditions in aqueous solution. The red shift in the absorption
(278–293 nm) and emission studies (310–335 nm) and the
formation of HBN at neutral pH are only due to the presence of a hydroxyl
group in tyrosine (absent in phenylalanine). Hence, these observations
together with the average lifetime values for GA at various pH conditions
authenticate the predominant fluorophore to be tyrosine only. The
emission and 3D emission contour spectra clearly reveal the exposure
of the intrinsic fluorophore to the aqueous phase, which was further
ascertained by the high lifetime values in fluorescence decay analysis.
Three-dimensional emission contour spectral technique was used as
an excellent tool to follow the chemistry of tyrosine. The study visually
manifested the multicharacteristic behavior of tyrosine in various
pH conditions and in different microdomains. The 3D emission contour
spectral studies confirm the formation of tyrosine HBN in GA. Tyrosine
moieties must be present in a geometrically favorable position for
HBN to form between two tyrosine moieties; hence, research can be
performed to find out the possibility for the formation of tyrosine
dimers (Tyr-O-O-Tyr) in GA. The dityrosine bridges are present in
many proteins like resilin,28 wheat gluten,
bread gluten, etc. Tyrosine dimers present in resilin are known for
their remarkable elastic properties. GA is used as an adhesive and
binder. Tyrosine dimers may have a role to play in the adhesive properties
of GA. Another interesting fact is that many proteins containing tyrosine
dimers are said to have similar protein sequence; hence, research
on this area could lead us to the protein sequence of GA.

4 Materials and Experimental Methods

acid, and 0.04 M boric acid. The basic buffer component comprises
0.2 M sodium hydroxide.

4.2 Steady-State Absorption and Fluorescence Measurements
The absorption spectra were recorded using an Agilent 8453 UV–visible
diode array spectrophotometer. The lamp source used for the UV–visible
range was deuterium and tungsten lamps. The fluorescence emission
and 3D spectral measurements were performed in Fluoromax 4P spectrofluorometer
(Horiba Jobin Yvon) using fluorescence software provided by the manufacturer.
Three-dimensional contour plots were obtained by simultaneously scanning
the excitation and emission monochromator. The excitation and emission
slits were set at 5 nm for all of the 3D measurements. The excitation
wavelength range was 250–350 nm, and the emission wavelength
range was 300–550 nm. The emission maximum corresponding to
each excitation wavelength was recorded, and a plot was generated
using Origin 8.0 Software.

4.3 Time-Correlated Single-Photon Counting (TCSPC) Technique
The fluorescence decay measurements of GA solutions were recorded
using IBH time-correlated single-photon counting spectrometer with
microchannel plate photomultiplier tube (Hamamatsu R3809U) as detector
and 280 nm light-emitting diode (Spectra Physics) as an excitation
source. TCSPC is a digital technique for counting photons, which are
time correlated with the excitation pulse. The heart of the method
is a time-to-amplitude converter. The fluorescence photons are collected
at the magic angle (54.7) to avoid the distortions due to the rotational
polarization. The measured decay is the convolution of the true fluorescence
decay, excitation function, and the instrument response function,
which results in the fluorescence kinetics parameters like lifetime
(τ) and relative amplitude (A). The data analysis
was carried out by the software provided by IBH (DAS-6), which is
based on reconvolution technique using iterative nonlinear least-squares
methods. The reconvolution is preceded by the series of iterations
until a χ2 is reduced. The quality of fit is normally
identified by the reduced χ2, weighed residual, and
autocorrelation function of the residuals.
