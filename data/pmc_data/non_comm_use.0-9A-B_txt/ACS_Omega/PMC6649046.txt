The development of cost-efficient,
highly active, and stable electrocatalysts
toward hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is vital for energy conversion
and clean hydrogen production. Herein, the novel electrocatalyst,
porous carbon-coated Ni/β-Mo2C (Ni/β-Mo2C@PC), possesses favorable hydrogen production performance
and stability in a wide range of pH via a facile dicyandiamide-blowing
and one-step synthesis method. The resultant Ni/β-Mo2C@PC displays pleasurable HER performance with low overpotentials
of 123, 155, and 179 mV at 10 mA cm–2 in 1 M KOH,
0.5 M H2SO4, and 1 M phosphate buffer solution
(PBS), respectively. Furthermore, Ni/β-Mo2C@PC retains
high durability with quite little decay after 24 h stability test,
suggesting the excellent activity and stability of Ni/β-Mo2C@PC served as HER electrocatalysts. Otherwise, it is advantageous
compared with Ni@PC, Mo2C@PC, and most other nonprecious
metal electrocatalysts. Benefiting from the synergistic effect of
the two popular active species, uniform distribution, and porous carbon
coating, these porous nanoelectrocatalysts showcase satisfactory electrocatalytic
activity, improving the charge transfer and kinetics during the reaction.
This work possesses significant universality, which can be applicable
to the synthesis of diverse nanostructured noble metal-free catalysts.

1 Introduction
With
the increasing requirement in energy and environmental issues,
renewable and green sources have received extensive attention in sustainable
and clean energy resources, such as hydrogen.1,2 Hydrogen
is supposed as a promising candidate in replacing traditional fossil
fuels with its cleanest and renewable merits.3,4 Water
electrolysis is an extremely efficient, fast, sustainable and squeaky-clean
technology to produce high-purity H2.5 Electrochemical water splitting especially depends on electrocatalysts
and electrolytes.6,7 Meanwhile, an ideal hydrogen evolution
reaction (HER) electrocatalyst must satisfy four basic requirements:
a low onset potential as much in accordance with the thermodynamic
value as possible, an ultralow Tafel slope, a high current density,
as well as long-term stability.8 As we
all know, Pt and Pt-based materials are the benchmark catalysts for
the HER;9−11 however, the low abundance and high cost efficiency
greatly hinder their wide range of applications.12,13 Therefore, it is meaningful to develop nonprecious metal catalysts
with superior catalytic activity, which are abundant around the earth
and less costly to extract.

Recently, early-transition carbides,14,15 borides16,17 nitrides,18,19 sulfides,20,21 phosphides,22,23 and selenides24 have been developed as typical nonprecious electrocatalysts
with excellent HER performance. Mo2C-based electrocatalysts,
possessing remarkable electronic feature and tunable phases, are widely
studied.25−27 However, the negative hydrogen bonding energy (ΔGH*) of Mo2C means that the intense
Mo–H bond contains unoccupied d orbits of Mo with large density.26−28 To improve catalytic performance, we can introduce the group VIII
transition metals to reduce the unoccupied d orbitals of Mo due to
the large number of electrons in the dopants. Lately, 3d transition
materials have been considered as noble metal-free electrocatalysts
for the HER, which are low-cost and exhibit high intrinsic activity
and fine stability.29−31 Among them, Ni-based catalysts have revealed optimal
performance in alkaline solution because of the extremely excellent
OH–Ni2+δ bond strength that is in favor of
intermediate adsorption.32,33 Nevertheless, the Ni-based
catalysts are apt to the aggregate and dissolve after long-term operating
environment where the activity easily deteriorates.34,35 To date, some effective strategies have been devoted to design splendid
catalysts, such as porous nanostructures,36−38 complex multimetallic
catalysts,39−41 and nitrogen doping.42,43 Recently,
a facile sugar-blowing technique has been reported that uses NH4Cl as a gas template and blows glucose-derived polymers into
large bubbles to generate porous carbon-coated nanostructures which
showed benign HER performance. The specific surface area is further
increased. The synthetic method contributes to an obvious increase
of the surface area.44 Based on the above
discussion, we speculate that taking advantage of the blowing technology
to prepare high-surface Ni/Mo2C nanocatalysts will possess
an excellent hydrogen production effect.

In this work, we reported
a novel Ni/β-Mo2C@PC
nanoelectrocatalyst synthesized through a facile blowing technique
combined with carburization treatment. The as-prepared porous Ni/β-Mo2C@PC nanoparticles are evaluated as electrocatalysts for the
HER, which is cost-efficient, long-term stable, and highly active.
Meanwhile, the composite catalyst has low overpotentials of 123, 155,
and 179 mV for reaching a current density of 10 mA cm–2 in 1.0 M KOH, 0.5 M H2SO4, and 1 M PBS, respectively.
These results prove that the reasonable design and rapid and effective
synthesis of electrocatalysts depend on low-cost Ni and Mo2C, which effectively prevents the agglomeration and uneven distribution.
In addition, the synthetic method contributes to an obvious increase
of the surface area and in the acceleration of electron transfer from
Ni to Mo2C. It is important to highlight that compared
with Ni@PC and Mo2C@PC, Ni/β-Mo2C@PC suggests
a much lower overpotential during the hydrogen evolution test at all
pH values. The remarkably catalytic activities can be attributed to
the synergetic effect of Ni and Mo, the nanoparticles uniformly dispersed
in graphitized carbon as well as the well-defined porous structure
with the large surface area.

2 Results and Discussion
The method of synthesizing Ni/β-Mo2C@PC by one
step is shown in Scheme 1. First, NiMoO4 nanorods were prepared by a hydrothermal
reaction.45 Next, under the Ar atmosphere,
the mixture of NiMoO4 nanorods, dicyandiamide (DCA), and
NH4Cl was annealed at 900 °C for 2 h and then gradually
cooled down to room temperature to obtain porous carbon-coated Ni/β-Mo2C@PC.

Scheme 1 Synthesis of Ni/β-Mo2C@PC Catalysts
via a Facile
One-Step Synthetic Method
Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) was carried out to characterize
Ni/β-Mo2C@PC samples annealed at different mass ratios
of NiMoO4, NH4Cl, and DCA from 1:1.5:1.5 to
1:14:14 (Figure 1).
Interestingly, the phase of Mo was changed from MoC to Mo2C versus the increasing amount of DCA. The strong metallic Ni phase
(JCPDS no. 65-0380) and pure MoC phase (JCPDS no. 65-8765) can be
clearly observed at the mass ratio of 1:1.5:1.5. When the mass ratio
increased to 1:4:4, the phase of MoC became appreciably weaker. This
MoC phase almost disappears as the mass ratio further increases to
1:8:8, while a new hexagonal β-Mo2C phase (JCPDS
no. 35-0787) can be clearly observed. The Mo2C phase still
remains when the mass ratio reaches 1:14:14. Based on these results,
the formation of the Ni/Mo2C@PC composite with an increasing
carbon content can be reasonably speculated to be the reaction described
in the following equation:46  

Figure 1 XRD
patterns of Ni/β-Mo2C@PC at different NiMoO4 nanorods, NH4Cl, and DCA mass ratio from 1:1.5:1.5
to 1:14:14.

To demonstrate the function
of the DCA precursor, we used glucose
and urea instead of the carbon source for mechanical grinding with
NH4Cl followed by further carbonization, the X-ray diffraction
(XRD) spectrum as demonstrated in Figure S3. The PXRD patterns exhibit the phases of Ni (JCPDS no. 65-0380)
and MoC (JCPDS no. 65-8765). No corresponding peak of β-Mo2C phase (JCPDS no. 35-0787) was observed. The DCA plays a
vital multifunctional role in the synthetic process; DCA was used
as a reducing and partitioning agent, which promotes the deoxidization
of the NiMoO4 precursor and prevents the aggregation of
the Ni/β-Mo2C@PC nanomaterials. At the same time,
in the synthetic system, DCA not only causes the in situ generation
of the N-doped carbon layer to cover the Ni/β-Mo2C@PC catalyst but also enhances the surface of the catalyst and improves
the stability of the nanocatalyst.47 The
linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves in 0.5 M H2SO4, 1 M KOH, and 1 M PBS are shown in Figure S9. Also, the mixture with urea and glucose showed poor HER
activity in 0.5 M H2SO4, 1 M KOH, and 1 M PBS
solutions. Based on the PXRD patterns and LSV curves, we reasoned
that the DCA precursor contributes to the formation of graphitized
carbon and highly active Ni and Mo2C particles, which further
leads to effective HER performance. It is worth noticing that the
five diffraction peaks of the Mo2C in Ni/β-Mo2C@PC are located around 34.4°, 37.9°, 52.1°,
61.9°, and 69.7°, in comparison with pure Mo2C, there appears a slight shift to a higher diffraction angle. The
result indicates that the shrinkage of the Mo2C cell due
to the radius of nickel is smaller than molybdenum. Moreover, the
strong metallic Ni phase presents in all samples from 1:1.5:1.5 to
1:14:14.

Typical transmission microscopy (TEM) images, as presented
in Figure 2, reveal
the diameter
of Ni/β-Mo2C nanoparticles is about 2–4 nm,
encapsulated by graphitic carbon shells. The high-resolution TEM (HRTEM)
images (Figure 2b)
display distinct lattice fringes with an interplanar spacing of 0.35
nm, corresponding to the (002) plane of graphite. Furthermore, HRTEM
photos of Ni/β-Mo2C@PC are presented in Figure 2c,e, in which d-spacing distances of 0.20 and 0.24 nm, consistent with
the (111) plane of Ni (JCPDS no. 65-0380) and (002) plane of Mo2C (JCPDS no. 35-0787), can be clearly seen, respectively.
It is worth mentioning that the majority of Ni nanoparticles are surrounded
by Mo2C nanoparticles, implying that there may be election
transfer between them. The elemental mapping of Mo and Ni, for Ni/β-Mo2C@PC as shown in Figure 2g–h, reveals the homogenous distribution of
Ni and Mo2C nanoparticles. The materials of Ni/β-Mo2C@PC are further confirmed the carbon component by Raman spectroscopy
(Figure S1). All samples show that two
clear peaks were located at around 1350 and 1580 cm–1, assigned to the D and G bands of graphitic carbon, respectively.
The value of ID/IG (the relative intensity ratio of the D-band to the G-band)
correlates with the existence of the defects and the degree of graphitization.48 For Ni/β-Mo2C@PC, the value
of ID/IG is
about 0.96, suggesting a higher degree of graphitization than Ni@PC,
Mo2C@PC, and Ni/β-Mo2C@PC mixtures, meaning
that more imperfection and defect sites exist in the carbon lattice
of Ni/β-Mo2C@PC. To further shed light on the porous
structure of Ni/β-Mo2C@PC, the N2 adsorption–desorption
isotherms are obtained (Figure S2). The
observed isotherm characteristics are similar to Type I and Type IV
isotherms with H3 hysteresis loops. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) specific surface area of the obtained sample is 104.94 m2 g–1. In addition, the single-point total
pore volume of Ni/β-Mo2C@PC is 0.23 m–3 g–1 measured at p/p0 = 0.9961. Ni/β-Mo2C@PC nanoparticles
have a mesoporous structure (3.7 nm) as indicated by the pore size
distribution data. The presence of mesopores may be due to the accumulation
of nanoparticles. The N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms
and the single-point total pore volume of the comparative samples
are placed in the Supporting Information (Figure S2). In contrast to the comparative sample, the Ni/β-Mo2C@PC has a large BET specific surface area. However, the large
BET area and pore size not only expose more active sites to ensure
that reactants and electrolytes are more accessible but also provide
good buffering capacity for volume expansion in higher HER activity.

the particle size distribution); (b–d) HRTEM images of Ni/β-Mo2C@PC; (f–h) EDX elemental mapping of Mo and Ni in Ni/β-Mo2C@PC.

We tested the electrocatalytic
HER activity of Ni/β-Mo2C@PC using a standard three-electrode
system in 1 KOH, 0.5
M H2SO4, and 1 M PBS aqueous solution in the
protection of N2, respectively. We first optimized the
mass loading of Ni/β-Mo2C@PC nanoparticles with 0.85
mg cm–2, as shown in Figure 3. Moreover, we also explored the annealing
temperature and time and the mass ratio of the precursor of the HER
(Figures S5–S8). Ultimately, the
optimal sample Ni/β-Mo2C@PC was obtained at 900 for
2 h, and the weight percentage of NiMoO4, NH4Cl, and DCA was 1:8:8 for optimum HER activity. The favorable HER
activity of catalysts under the above conditions can be attributed
to the excellent balance of the synergetic effect of Ni and Mo2C, the conductivity, and porosity. The HER polarization curves
of Ni@PC, Mo2C@PC, Ni/β-Mo2C mixtures,
Ni/β-Mo2C@PC, and commercial Pt/C (20 wt %) were
tested and are also shown in Figure 3. By contrast, the overpotential of the Pt electrode
is almost at least close to zero. Meantime, Ni/β-Mo2C@PC give the lowest overpotential of 123, 155, and 179 mV to achieve
10 mA cm–2 in alkaline, acidic, and neutral solutions,
which are much smaller than that of Ni@PC, Mo2C@PC, and
Ni/β-Mo2C@PC mixtures. Meanwhile, the η10 values of Ni/β-Mo2C@PC are advantageous
compared to similar nonprecious metal catalysts described in a plethora
of documented literature studies (Tables S1–S3).

Figure 3 (a–f) Polarization curves of HER at 5 mV s–1 and corresponding Tafel plots in 1 M KOH, 0.5 M H2SO4, and 1 M PBS.

Figure 3b,d,f
reveals
the Tafel slopes of 87, 91, and 106 mV dec–1 for
Ni/β-Mo2C@PC in 1 M KOH, 0.5 M H2SO4, and 1 M PBS, respectively, which are lower than Ni/β-Mo2C mixture. In addition, the Tafel slopes obtained by processing
the polarization curve are also another important parameter for estimating
the electrocatalytic performance. The smaller slopes mean that the
HER rate increases greatly with the increase of the overpotential.
Meanwhile, the Tafel slope values mean that Volmer step-water in alkaline
media (H2O + e– ↔ H + OH–) and acidic media (H2 + e–↔
H) is the rate-determining step. The neutral medium is similar to
the alkaline medium.49

The electrochemically
active area is estimated via electrochemical
double-layer capacitances (Cdl), which
is proportional to the effective electrochemical surface area, as
marked in Figures S10–S13. The Cdl values of Ni/β-Mo2C@PC are
19.5, 16.1, and 14.2 mF cm–2 in 1 M KOH, 0.5 M H2SO4, and 1 M PBS, respectively. The Cdl of Ni/β-Mo2C@PC was 2–5 times
larger than that of other comparative catalysts, indicating that more
active sites are available for the Ni/β-Mo2C@PC catalyst.
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was carried out to study
the charge transfer kinetics in the hydrogen generation process of
the catalysts (Figure S14). The EIS test
was carried out at overpotentials of 50, 80, and 100 mV in alkaline,
acidic, and neutral solutions, respectively. At the same time, the
EIS spectra of Ni/β-Mo2C mixtures, Mo2C@PC, and Ni@PC were acquired (Figure S15). Two time constants are shown in the Nyquist plots of Ni/β-Mo2C@PC, where the Rct of Ni/β-Mo2C@PC is 4.2, 4.7, and 11.2 Ω in alkaline, acidic, and
neutral measurements, respectively, at an overpotential of 100 mV.
This result means that Ni/β-Mo2C@PC has the smallest Rct value compared to Ni/β-Mo2C mixtures and Mo2C@PC. The smaller Rct values mean the faster charge transfer at the Ni/β-Mo2C@PC electrodes, which are attributed to the porous composite
structure.

Another important factor is excellent durability
for outstanding
catalysts. The long-term durability of Ni/β-Mo2C@PC
was examined by optimized mass loading on Ni foam (Figure S16). There was only very little decay at 1 M KOH and
1 M PBS electrolyte after long-term continuous CV scanning for 2000
sweeps and chronoamperometry testing at certain overpotentials. Moreover,
in the 0.5 H2SO4, there was almost no loss of
activity in the current density measured and chronoamperometry measured,
revealing satisfactory stability under all pH conditions.

To
further investigate chemical composition, X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy of Ni/β-Mo2C@PC was performed, which
demonstrated the existence of Ni, Mo, C, N, and O elements, as observed
in Figure S18. The high-resolution Mo 3d
spectrum in Ni/β-Mo2C@PC is shown in Figure 4, which deconvoluted into two
peaks consistent with Mo2+ (228.3, 231.4 eV) and Mo6+ (232.4, 235.2 eV). In these Mo valences, the Mo6+ species is derived from surface oxidation, which has been shown
to be inactive for the HER.50−52 Among them, Mo2+ can
be attributed to molybdenum carbides (Mo2C). It has been
confirmed by seniors that Mo2C was the active substance
of the HER.25,26 In contrast, the Mo of Ni/β-Mo2C@PC has lower binding energy than Mo2+ (228.4,
231.5 eV) and Mo6+ (232.4, 235.6 eV) in Ni/β-Mo2C mixtures as well as Mo2+ (228.4, 231.6 eV) and
Mo6+ (232.4, 235.7 eV) in Ni/β-Mo2C@PC,
indicating that the Mo valence is lower in Ni/β-Mo2C@PC.46 Meanwhile, the Ni 2p XPS spectrum
peaks around at 852.7, 856.0, 861.5, and 854.5 eV are assigned to
metallic state Ni, Niδ+, and Ni2+, respectively.53,54 It is worth mentioning that most of the surface Ni is oxidized to
the +2 oxidation state.2,33 Ni/β-Mo2C@PC
showed higher activity by comparing the Ni/β-Mo2C
mixtures, Mo2C@PC, and Ni@PC. The EIS spectrum showed that
the Rct value of Ni/β-Mo2C@PC was the smallest, indicating that electron transfer was faster.
In addition, the peaks of Ni2+ are positively shifted by
0.2 and 0.1 eV in Ni/β-Mo2C@PC compared with Ni/β-Mo2C mixtures and Ni@PC, which means that Ni has a higher valence
state in Ni/β-Mo2C@PC. According to these insights,
we proposed that the synergetic effect of Ni and Mo2C enables
electron transfer from Ni to Mo2C, resulting in higher
Ni valence and lower Mo valence and thus further explain the reasons
for improving HER performance.46

Figure 4 XPS spectra
of the Ni/β-Mo2C@PC electrocatalyst:
(a) high-resolution spectra of Ni 2P; (b) high-resolution spectra
of Mo 3d.

The Ni/Mo2C@PC catalyst
was thoroughly characterized
after HER measurements. After the HER test, the morphology of the
particles hardly changed compared to the original topography. The
lattice fringes of Ni and Mo2C can still be clearly seen
(Figure S24). The XRD patterns (Figure S23) also demonstrate that the structures
of the nanoparticles Ni and Mo2C were retained after the
three media reactions, except that the intensity of the peak is slightly
reduced compared to the original sample. The XPS spectra (Figures S25–S26) show that there was no
significant change in the 3d pattern of Mo. However, the intensity
of Mo6+ is slightly increased compared to the original
sample, which was attributable to the oxidation of the surface of
the Mo2C nanoparticle. There were no significant changes
in the N 2p region after the HER test.55

3 Conclusions
In summary, a novel and facile
strategy was used to synthesize
Ni-doped Mo2C nanoparticles for efficient electrocatalytic
hydrogen production. Ni/β-Mo2C@PC has overpotentials
of 123, 155, and 179 mV at 10 mA cm–2, which is
superior to single Ni and Mo2C in acidic, alkaline, and
neutral solutions. Moreover, the catalyst demonstrates robust stability
after CV2000 and stability test. The excellent performance
of this composite catalyst can be ascribed to the synergistic effect
of Ni and Mo2C, porous structure, high surface area, outstanding
conductivity, and uniform distribution. This work implies the opportunity
to effectively synthesize novel nanomaterials via a facile method
that may have broader applications in different areas such as green
energy conversion and storage.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials and Methods
Commercial
chemicals used in reactions were purchased without purification. Elemental
analyses were performed with a PerkinElmer 240C elemental analyzer.
PXRD patterns were gathered by a Siemens D5005 diffractometer with
Cu Kα (λ = 1.5418 Å) radiation ranging from 5°
to 80° at 293 K with a rate of 5 min–1. A JY
LabRam HR 800 was utilized for the Raman spectra. A SU8000 ESEM FEG
microscope was utilized to obtain the interrelated energy dispersive
X-ray detector (EDX) spectra. The N2 sorption tests were
measured on automatic volumetric adsorption equipment (Belsorp mini
II). TEM was accomplished on a JEOL-2100F transmission electron microscope.

4.2 Synthesis of NiMoO4 Nanorods
The NiMoO4 nanorods were obtained via a hydrothermal
method. Ni(NO3)2·6H2O (4 mmol)
and Na2MoO4·2H2O (4 mmol) were
separately dissolved in 10 mL of water and then added with Na2MoO4·2H2O solution under vigorous
stirring. The resulting solution was added to 40 mL of ethanol. Finally,
the mixture was placed in to a 100 mL Teflon reactor after stirring
at room temperature for 24 h and further sealed, heating at 150 °C
for 6 h. The precipitate was collected by centrifugation, washed,
and vacuum-dried at 80 °C.

4.3 Preparation
of Ni/β-Mo2C@PC,
Ni/β-Mo2C Mixtures, Mo2C@PC, and Ni@PC
Mechanochemical synthetic reactions were carried out in a ball
mill using a 50 mL stainless steel grinding jar and 5 steel balls
with 10 mm diameter. NiMoO4 nanorods (0.5 g), DCA (4 g),
and NH4Cl (4 g) were added into the jar. Then, the mixtures
were ground for 30 min at 40 Hz. The Ni/β-Mo2C@PC
was obtained via placing samples in a tube furnace with the ramping
rate at 5 °C min–1, subsequently, maintained
at 900 °C for 2 h and naturally cooled down to 25 °C under
Ar flow. The preparations of Ni@PC, Mo2C@PC, and Ni/β-Mo2C mixtures were similar to that of Ni/β-Mo2C@PC. The Ni@PC was obtained by replacing NiMoO4 nanorods
with Ni (NO3)2·6H2O (0.5 g),
and then DCA (4 g) and NH4Cl (4 g) were added into the
jar subsequently annealed under the same conditions as above. The
Mo2C@PC was obtained by replacing NiMoO4 nanorods
with (NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O (0.3 g), and then DCA (4 g) and NH4Cl (4 g) were
added into the jar subsequently annealed under the same conditions
as above. The Ni/β-Mo2C mixture is prepared by mixing
Ni (NO3)2·6H2O (0.5 g) and (NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O (0.3 g) in the same situation.

4.4 Electrochemical
Measurements
We used
an electrochemical workstation (CHI 660e, China) to conduct the electrochemical
measurements with a three-electrode system. The working electrode
is a GC electrode (d = 3 mm), a graphite rod is the
counter electrode, and the reference electrode is an Ag/AgCl electrode.
For Ni/β-Mo2C@PC, 6 mg of the samples was dispersed
in the mixture of 100 μL of 0.5 wt % Nafion solution, 0.2 mL
of water and 0.2 mL of ethanol, followed by ultrasonication for 30
min to make an even suspension. After ultrasonication, 5 μL
of the suspension was pipetted onto the GC electrode. Then, the working
electrode was dried naturally under ambient temperature. The final
mass loading of the catalysts was about 0.85 mg cm–2. The samples of Ni/β-Mo2C mixtures, Mo2C@PC, and Ni@PC were prepared with the same procedure with a mass
loading of 0.85 mg cm–2. The commercial Pt/C electrocatalyst
with the same preparation was conducted with the same loading with
Ni/β-Mo2C@PC. The LSV curves were measured deaerated
with nitrogen with a scan rate of 5 mV s–1 in 0.5
M H2SO4, 1 M KOH, and 1 M PBS aqueous solutions
at 25 °C prior to the HER. The catalysts were activated using
20 cyclic voltammetry scans with a scan rate of 100 mV s–1 before recording the electrochemical performance. All the potentials
were referenced to a reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) computed
by the Nernst equation: ERHE = EAg/AgCl + 0.059 pH + 0.197 V. All data displayed
here were treated without iR compensation. The CV
measurements were taken with scan rates of 10, 30, 50, 80, 100, 150,
and 200 mV s–1 between 0.10 and 0.30 V, respectively.
EIS spectra were operated on a PARSTAT 2273 electrochemical system
(Princeton Applied Research Instrumentation, USA) with the frequencies
in the range of 0.1–100 000 Hz at an amplitude of 5
mV.
