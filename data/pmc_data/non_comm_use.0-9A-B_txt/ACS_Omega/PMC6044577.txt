Prostate cancer is
prevalent among cancers in men. A simple method
for screening of reliable biomarkers is pivotal for early detection
of prostate cancer.  Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) has been
a commonly used biomarker for prostate cancer, in spite of its false-positive
limitation. On the other hand, alpha-methylacyl-CoA racemase (AMACR),
a metabolic enzyme, has been proven to be a highly expressed biomarker
in prostate cancer cells. Therefore, a method or tool, which can detect
either PSA or AMACR or both simply, cost effectively, and with high
sensitivity and selectivity is desirable. We describe a novel bioconjugated,
single-use biosensor capable of detecting both PSA and AMACR antigens
in undiluted human serum. The preparation of the biosensor by the
bioconjugation mechanism occurred within a day, which could be completed
prior to actual testing. The effectiveness of the bioconjugation mechanism
and the coverage of the electrode surface of the biosensor were experimentally
assessed. Measurements of PSA and AMACR antigens and the specificity
of the biosensor were carried out using differential pulse voltammetry.
This biosensor was single-use and cost-effective and required a small
quantity of test medium and relatively short preparation time, providing
a very attractive biosensor for the detection of the biomarkers of
prostate cancer.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Prostate
cancer was the most prevalent cancer in men for new cancer
diagnoses and the third leading cause of cancer death in the United
States in 2017.1,2 Metabolic syndrome was considered
as a possible risk factor, and there was insufficient evidence for
the correlation.3,4 Prostate-specific antigen (PSA)
is a widely used biomarker in clinical screening for prostate cancer.5 However, PSA also acted as a biomarker in many
noncancerous conditions, such as inflammation, infection, trauma,
and benign prostatic hyperplasia. Thus, the screening of PSA led to
poor specificity, especially with an intermediate range of valid PSA
concentration of 4–10 ng mL–1.6,7 Therefore, a more specific biomarker is desirable for early diagnosis
of prostate cancer. One of the emerging biomarkers for prostate cancer
is alpha-methylacyl-CoA racemase (AMACR), a metabolic enzyme, which
has been proven to be a highly expressed biomarker in prostate cancer
cells.8−10 AMACR, a peroxisomal enzyme, facilitates β-oxidation
of branched-chain fatty acids by changing (2R,S,6R,10R)-pristanoyl-CoA
to (2S,S,6R,10R)-pristanoyl-CoA.11 The mutations
in the gene AMACR lead to reduced enzyme activity caused by the raised
level of branched-chain fatty acids. Messenger-RNA(mRNA) of AMACR
is overexpressed in prostate epithelium during the translation process.
For prostate cancer patients, the mRNA level of AMACR was around 9
times higher compared to that of the control group, and the protein
AMACR level increased around 2.5 times comparing to that of the normal
group, making AMACR an ideal biomarker for prostate cancer.8−12 Although AMACR is a tissue-carried protein, studies proved the possibilities
of detecting AMACR directly from body fluid samples of prostate cancer
patients.13,14

Conventional methods for the detection
of AMACR included techniques
of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, radioimmunoassay, chemiluminescence
immunoassay, and fluoro-immunoassay (FIA). The FIA method showed that
the detection limit of AMACR was down to 4.6 pg mL–1.15 The accuracy of detection using these
techniques was applicable for screening purposes. However, these tests
were laborious, time-consuming, and expensive. Thus, the cost-effective
and time-efficient advantages of biosensor technology became attractive
for biomarker detection in early monitoring of disease progression.
However, very limited studies were reported for the detection of AMACR
using an electrochemical-based biosensor. Square wave voltammetry
to directly detect AMACR using aptamers immobilized on a polymer substrate
was reported with a detection limit of 1.4 fM in human plasma.16 Thus, at this juncture, a biosensor can detect
the biomarkers of prostate cancer; AMACR and/or PSA will be of significance,
providing a very useful tool for the diagnosis of prostate cancer,
regardless of the selection of the suitable biomarker of prostate
cancer: either AMACR or PSA.

Self-assembled monolayer (SAM)
is a promising platform technology
for biosensor applications.17−21 Typically, SAM is formed by an alkane-linked thiol molecule producing
a gold–sulfur (Au–S) bond with the gold electrode surface
of a biosensor. Then, activation of the terminal functional group
followed, immobilizing antigen binding, such as antibody, aptamer,
and specific receptor. The formation of the gold electrode elements,
working and counter electrodes, of the biosensor could be accomplished
by various techniques and in different dimensions. In this study,
the gold electrode element was a thin gold film, 50 nm in thickness
and was deposited by sputtering physical vapor deposition by a roll-to-roll
cost-effective manufacturing method, producing the biosensor relatively
inexpensively and effectively. This biosensor was a three-electrode
configuration, and the details of the configuration and the characterization
of this biosensor have been reported elsewhere.22 For a comprehensive development of this biosensor, six
different SAMs were studied, compared, and assessed in this research.
These general preparing procedures of a commonly used biosensor were
complex and required days for preparation and consumed excess chemicals.
Furthermore, the biosensors using SAMs had relatively low sensitivity
and poor reproducibility, because of common monolayer defects, such
as pinholes, inhomogeneity of surface coverage, and others. Therefore,
a new technique for the preparation of a biosensor was used in this
study, and it was the bioconjugation mechanism.

The bioconjugation
mechanism conjugates two or more molecules,
forming a novel complex embracing the combined properties of its individual
components.16 This method makes a
zero-length linkage between the protein and electrode elements of
the biosensor possible. Furthermore, this bioconjugation technique
will shorten the preparation process, enhancing the coverage of the
biosensor surface/minimizing the pinhole effect. Consequently, this
will improve the practical clinical application. The interaction between
antibody and antigen remained to be the biorecognition mechanism in
this research endeavor. In this study, anti-AMACR and anti-PSA were
modified by the bioconjugation technique using N-succinimidyl S-acetylthioacetate (SATA) to conjugate the antibody. The
final product of the conjugation reaction was a thiol group-linked
AMACR antibody or PSA antibody, which directly linked with the thin
gold film electrode element surfaces of the biosensor through incubation.
After being modified by a thiol-linked antibody, fabrication of an
AMACR or a PSA biosensor was completed. This single-step preparation
took approximately one day including the incubation time for the preparation
of the biosensor.

Thus, the combination of bioconjugation technique
in preparation,
microfabrication of a thin gold film-based biosensor prototype, and
differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) measurement technique results
in a single-use, cost-effective, and highly sensitive and selective
biosensor for the detection of the biomarkers of prostate cancer,
AMACR and PSA, a very attractive and practical diagnostic tool for
the screening application of prostate cancer.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Evaluation of the Effectiveness
of Coverage
and Antibody Bonding Based on Different SAM Systems and Bioconjugated
Systems
SAM is pivotal for binding the antibody. Different
configurations of the SAM affect the orientation of the antibody and
the electrode surface coverage of the biosensor, resulting in various
binding effects and current signal outputs for electrochemical detection.
Six different SAM systems were prepared examining their effectiveness
in surface preparation of the biosensor in this study. The configurations
of the six SAM systems are shown in Table 1. Figure 1a shows the formation of the SAM system for biosensor
development. The bioconjugation mechanism aims at the modification
of an antibody to produce an external thiol-linker on the antibody,
which is able to directly react with the gold surface to form an Au–S
bond without complex surface treatment. Figure 1b shows the process of bioconjugation-based
biosensor fabrication. The detailed fabrication procedure for both
processes is demonstrated in the Experiments section.

acid.

The sensitivity and
the reproducibility of the biosensors prepared
using different SAM systems and bioconjugation mechanism were evaluated.
Three different AMACR antigen concentrations (50, 10, and 2 ng/mL)
were prepared in 0.1 M phosphate-buffer saline (PBS) and drop-casted
onto the biosensors with different SAM systems incubating for 2 h
at room temperature. After incubation, the biosensor was rinsed by
0.1 M PBS solution and dried by nitrogen. DPV was used to measure
the conductivity on the biosensor. A redox coupling solution (20 μL)
of potassium ferrocyanide (K4Fe(CN)6) and potassium
ferricyanide (K3Fe(CN)6) of 5 mM each was applied
onto the biosensor surface. Of these six different SAM systems, SAM2-
and SAM4-prepared biosensors showed unpromising reproducibility, and
they were not investigated any further. Figure 3a shows the sensitivity comparison for the
other four SAM systems studied as described in Table 1. SAM3 demonstrated the best sensitivity;
the difference among these four SAM modifications was minute and the
sensitivity was at the level of 104 to 105 μA·μM–1·cm–2 which was only fair.
The SAM1 system (3-MPA) retained the highest R-square
value of these four SAM systems which was 0.698 (n = 3). This R-square value was significantly lower
than that of the bioconjugation-prepared biosensor [R-square = 0.967 (n = 5)], indicating a lower reproducibility
of the SAM system for the detection of AMACR. The results of this
study convincingly led us to apply the bioconjugation mechanism to
prepare the biosensor for better achievement of an antibody–antigen
recognition mechanism.

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy
(EIS) was used to assess
the effectiveness of antibody binding by different SAM techniques
as well as the bioconjugation method. Using the anti-AMACR protein
as the example, four selected SAM systems and the bioconjugated modified
biosensors were investigated. The impedance difference between the
SAM only biosensor and antibody-bonded SAM biosensor as well as that
between the bare biosensor and the antibody-bonded bioconjugated biosensor
was examined. A concentration of 1.25 μg/mL anti-AMACR protein
was used for all the SAM and bioconjugated systems. The biosensors
were incubated for 15 h at 4 °C. The biosensor was then rinsed
by using 0.1 M PBS solution and dried by using nitrogen gas. The redox
coupling solution (20 μL) of K4Fe(CN)6 and K3Fe(CN)6 of 5 mM of each was applied
on the surface for the EIS measurement. The AC frequency range for
the EIS measurement was 0.01–10 000 Hz. The Nyquist
plots of this study are shown in Figure S1 for four different SAMs and Figure 2b for the bioconjugation-prepared antibody monolayer.
The impedance difference before and after incubation of the antibody
was calculated by EC-Lab software fitting the Randle circuit as shown
in Figure S1a, in which R1 represented the solution resistance, R2 characterized the charge transfer resistance, W2 indicated the diffusion limited process, and Q2 represented the electron transfer process.22,23 The difference of R2 value of each SAM
system before/after incubation of the antibody was used to display
the impedance difference as shown in Table 2. The biggest impedance difference was shown
from the bioconjugation method-prepared biosensor in Figure 2b with a calculated resistance
value at 6635 Ω, which was significantly larger than that of
any SAM system, indicating the maximum efficiency of antibody coverage
by using bioconjugation for antibody monolayer formation. Figure 2b shows the EIS characterization
of the bioconjugation-prepared biosensor. The unconjugated antibody
(blue line) and SATA linker without antibody (gray line) were also
incubated for 2 h on the bare electrode. The changes of resistance
on the sensor surface because of gold–protein affinity and
only SATA linking with gold were not comparable with the resistance
provided by the SATA-conjugated antibody (yellow line), indicating
that the best coverage of the electrode surface was produced by the
SATA-conjugated antibody. High coverage of the antibody on the biosensor
surface has been proved to be able to provide more sensitive quantification
of analyte than lack of coverage condition.24

To demonstrate the stability and reproducibility of
the bioconjugation-prepared
biosensor, after incubation with the bioconjugated antibody, cyclic
voltammetry (CV) (Figure 2c) was used to examine the biosensors in the presence of [Fe(CN)6]3–/4– at different scan rates ranging
from 30 to 100 mV/s. On the basis of the Randles–Sevcik equation,
with a constant number of electrons transferred based on the redox
event, fixed electrode surface area, diffusion coefficient, and the
concentration of the redox coupling, the square root of the scan rate
is linear proportional to the current outputs as shown in Figure 2d, demonstrating
good stability and reproducibility of the bioconjugated antibody-covered
electrode based on the R-square value of 0.9996.
Detailed costs for biosensor fabrication based on the SAM method and
bioconjugation method were also compared and are shown in Table S1. The bioconjugation method-fabricated
sensor was around $2.10/sensor and the SAM method-fabricated sensor
was around $3.03/sensor, which outlays 44% more than the cost of the
bioconjugation method.

2.2 Qualification of a Bioconjugation-Based
Biosensor
Surface Using Atomic Force Microscopy
Atomic force microscopy
(AFM) was used to confirm the surface difference between a bare gold
working electrode and a thiol-linked AMACR antibody-covered gold working
electrode. A scan size of 20 μm × 10 μm was applied
at a scan rate of 0.513 Hz. Figure 3a,b shows the topography of
a bare gold electrode image and a thiol-linked antibody-covered gold
electrode image. Figure 3a demonstrates a smooth gold electrode surface with a maximum height
of 148 nm. Figure 3b shows a more zigzag surface with a maximum height of 76 000
nm. The white plumped ball shapes indicate a rougher topography with
the existence of the AMACR antibody. The white plumped balls also
show a very similar size with radius around 200–250 nm, indicating
a homogeneous distribution of the antibody on the surface. The qualification
changes on the gold electrode surface observed by AFM provide solid
proof of the capability of the bioconjugation mechanism on biosensor
antibody film fabrication.

2.3 DPV Measurement of the AMACR Antigen in PBS
and Undiluted Human Serum
The bioconjugation method-prepared
AMACR biosensor was then used for the detection of an antigen of AMACR
of different concentrations. Eight different concentrations of AMACR
antigen were prepared in 0.1M PBS solution ranging from 10 to 0.05
μg/mL. The antigen sample (20 μL) was placed onto the
AMACR biosensor and was incubated for 1 h at room temperature. The
AMACR biosensor was then rinsed by 0.1 M PBS and dried by nitrogen
gas. A redox probe solution (20 μL) of K4Fe(CN)6 and K3Fe(CN)6 of 5 mM each was applied
onto the biosensor surface, and DPV measurement was then made. DPV
was conducted at the potential range from −0.3 to 0.3 V. Figure 4a shows the DPV measurement
of eight different concentrations with a limitation of testing found
at 0.05 μg/mL. The same experiment was also conducted using
the AMACR antigen in undiluted human serum with a limitation of detection
as shown in Figure 4b, and the calibration is shown in Figure 4c with a linear fit of Y = 2.30 × 10–5X = 6.39 ×
10–6 and R-square value of 0.900
(n = 5).

2.4 DPV Measurements
of PSA in PBS and Undiluted
Human Serum
For comprehensive detection of prostate cancer,
PSA was also evaluated using the bioconjugation mechanism-prepared
PSA biosensor and DPV. PSA antigen in PBS solution was firstly tested
based on an antibody concentration of 0.27 μg/mL. Concentrations
of PSA antigen ranging from 2 to 0.1 μg/mL were prepared in
0.1 M PBS solution. The selected PSA antigen solution (20 μL)
was drop-casted on the prepared PSA biosensor and incubated for 1
h at room temperature. The PSA biosensor was then rinsed by 1 mL of
0.1 M PBS solution and dried by nitrogen gas. A redox probe solution
(20 μL) of K4Fe(CN)6 and K3Fe(CN)6 of 5 mM each was applied onto the biosensor surface,
and DPV measurement was then made. DPV measurement is shown in Figure 5a with a detection
limit of 0.1 μg/mL. DPV measurement on PSA in undiluted human
serum was also conducted with a PSA antigen concentration range of
0–4 μg/mL using an antibody concentration of 0.55 μg/mL.
The same procedure as described in the PBS test was applied for the
undiluted human serum test. DPV measurement is shown in Figure 5b with a detection limit of
0.2 μg/mL, and its calibration curve is shown in Figure 5c with a linear fit of Y = 2.41 × 10–5X = 4.33 × 10–7 and R-square
value of 0.967 (n = 5).

serum. (d) Interference test on the PSA biosensor using the AMACR
antigen.

2.5 Interference
Study of the AMACR Biosensor
and PSA Biosensor
Interference studies on the AMACR biosensor
and PSA biosensor were conducted to confirm the selectivity of each
biosensor. For the AMACR biosensor study, undiluted human serum with
a PSA antigen concentration of 5 μg/mL was mixed with 5 μg/mL
of AMACR antigen. The same incubation and detection procedures were
conducted as described in section 2.3. The
DPV measurement result is shown in Figure 4d, in which the serum with mixed PSA/AMACR
antigens showed no current output difference with only AMACR antigen
in the serum, indicating that the PSA antigen did not interfere with
the AMACR measurement by the AMACR biosensor. Similarly, for the PSA
biosensor study, undiluted human serum with an AMACR antigen concentration
of 2.5 μg/mL was mixed with 4 μg/mL PSA antigen solution.
The same incubation and detection procedures were conducted as described
in section 2.4. The DPV measurement result
is shown in Figure 5d, in which the mixed PSA/AMACR antigens showed no current output
difference with only the PSA antigen in the serum, indicating that
the AMACR antigen did not interfere with the PSA measurement by the
PSA biosensor.

3 Conclusion
Bioconjugation
mechanism has shown promising ability in applications
for biosensor development. The fabrication process using the bioconjugation
mechanism demonstrated the advantages of time-efficiency, cost-effectiveness,
and most importantly, a simple method that makes it possible for medical
professionals to operate the biosensor fabrication process. Two different
biosensors for the detection of prostate cancer were fabricated. The
developed biosensors showed excellent capability in the detection
of biomarkers of prostate cancer in both PBS and undiluted human serum
with good selectivity proved by two different interference studies.

5 Experiments
5.1 Preparation of an SAM-Based Biosensor
All the SAM systems
were prepared in ethanol solution. Thin gold
film-based biosensors were first cleaned as described in previous
studies22,25 and immersed in the different SAM solutions
for 24 h at room temperature. After 24 h of immersion in the SAM solution,
the biosensors were rinsed by using deionized water and dried by using
nitrogen gas. EDC (0.2 M) and 0.05 M NHS in 0.1 M PBS solution were
prepared to activate the carboxylate group on the SAM by immersing
the biosensors in the prepared SAM solution for 1 h at room temperature.
Using anti-AMACR as an example, 20 μL of anti-AMACR solution
with a concentration of 1 μg mL–1 was drop-casted
onto the biosensor after the activation process and incubated for
15 h at 4 °C. The biosensor was then ready to be assessed for
the effectiveness of the SAM system. The process of fabrication of
the SAM biosensor is shown in Figure 1a.

5.2 Preparation of the Thiol-Linked
Anti-AMACR
or Anti-PSA Protein
The bioconjugation mechanism was applied
to create the thiol-linked anti-AMACR or anti-PSA protein. SATA was
used to conjugate the antibody to produce a thiol-linked anti-AMACR
or anti-PSA protein. Typically, for the preparation of the thiol-linked
anti-AMACR, 0.5 mg of SATA was firstly dissolved in 1 mL of DMSO.
The prepared SATA solution (1 μL) was mixed with 30 μL
of anti-AMACR in 0.1 M PBS solution based on a molar ratio of 20:1
between SATA and the antibody.26 This mixed
solution was incubated for 30 min at room temperature. The solution
was then diluted to a total volume of 500 μL by using 0.1 M
PBS solution and transferred into an Amicon ultra-0.5 10k filter tube,
centrifuging at 12 000 rpm for 15 min at 5 °C. Twenty-five
microliters of the filtered solution was obtained, and this filtered
solution was reacted with 5 μL of 0.5 M hydroxylamine and 25
mM EDTA in 0.1 M PBS solution at room temperature for 2 h. An Amicon
ultra-0.5 10k filter tube was used again to filter out any molecules
lower than 10 kDa molecular weight. This filtered solution was diluted
to 500 μL by 10 mM EDTA in 0.1 M PBS solution and centrifuged
at 12 000 rpm for 15 min at 8 °C. The solution was then
diluted again using 10 mM EDTA in 0.1 M PBS solution to 500 μL
and centrifuged again at 12 000 rpm for 15 min at 8 °C.
After this second centrifuge process, the obtained solution was thiol-linked
anti-AMACR. The bioconjugation process is shown in Figure 1b. The thiol-linked anti-PSA
solution was prepared in a similar manner, which is described in the Supporting Information.

5.3 AMACR
Biosensor and PSA Biosensor Fabrication
Based on the Thiol-Linked Antibody
Using the anti-AMACR solution
as an example, it reactedwith the gold electrode surface, forming
a strong Au–S bond linking the antibody onto the gold working
electrode. The thiol-linked anti-AMACR was firstly diluted by 0.15
M NaCl and 10 mM EDTA in 0.1 M PBS solution to a concentration of
1.25 μg/mL. The gold biosensor was prepared in a batch of ten
and cleaned as described in a previous study.22 The diluted thiol-linked anti-AMACR solution was vortexed. Twenty
microliters of the solution at a concentration of 1.25 μg/mL
was drop-casted onto the cleaned gold biosensor for incubation for
8 h at 4 °C. The preparation step of the PSA biosensor is similar
and is described in the Supporting Information.
