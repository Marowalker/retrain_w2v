Molecular dynamics simulations have
been performed on the interface between linear saturated hydrocarbons
and water in the presence of an asphaltene molecule by measuring the
properties such as mean square displacement, radial distribution function,
density profile using ave/spatial command, and interfacial tension
(IFT) by OPLS and TIP3P FF (force fields). The box of simulation contained
one particle of asphaltene, 100 linear saturated hydrocarbons molecules,
and 300 water molecules in mixture with interfacial appropriate positioning.
The main results show that a small amount of asphaltene in the interface
does not significantly alter the data of IFT and that the aliphatic
and aromatic groups have preferred orientation.

1 Introduction
Molecular
modeling studies of asphaltene1 are important
because with them it is possible to relate important
molecular properties such as structure factors and physicochemical
properties such as molecular electronic structure, density, viscosity,
and principally the friccohesity2 property
to be related with dipole momentum values. With this tool, it becomes
possible to develop algorithms capable of calculating a specific molecular
structure and predict the properties of these molecules in different
solvents and different temperature and pressure conditions.

Headen et al.3 worked with asphaltene
in combination with toluene or heptane using the molecular dynamics
(MD) technique. At large, it was detected that asphaltene
forms both dimers and trimers in toluene as in heptane, that is, aggregates.
The authors observed that the aggregates hold longer in heptane than
in toluene.

The stability study of concentrated emulsions of
water in oil is
imperative to provide a scientific approach to a major problem in
the oil industry, helping to eliminate the empiricism present in the
scientific community. Some studies have proposed the use of MD tools
for understanding the conditions of the asphaltene in petroleum system
models. It is important to note that these studies were useful for
understanding the conditions of stability of oil/water emulsion systems.

Mikami et al.4 observed the interfacial
rheology5−7 performance of asphaltene molecules in the oil/water
interface using MD simulations. It was found that asphaltene is preferentially
transmitted in the oily phase (toluene), whereas they accumulate in
oil/water interface to pure heptane. The authors also found that the
interfacial tension (IFT)8,9 system containing few
asphaltene molecules is next to a system of heptane/pure water.

Ruiz-Morales and Mullins10 verified
that the asphaltene molecules remain in oil/water interface with the
preferential orientation, where the aromatic region lies in the hydrocarbon–water
interface plane, although the aliphatic chains are perpendicular to
the hydrocarbon–water interface. The authors also clarify that
the rigidity interfacial film must have a direct correlation with
guidance as to the oil/water interface plans.

The authors quoted
above have contributed so far to the understanding
of the accommodation process of asphaltene molecules at the interface.
The literature needs to advance in other aspects to answer a series
of problems, mainly, which are the substances that manage to destabilize
the grouping of asphaltenes1 in the interface,
favoring the rupture of the interfacial film.

In this work, we have performed MD simulations
to obtain information on the asphaltene influence in the interface,
with the aid of computer tools to measure properties such as radial
distribution function (RDF), mean square displacement (MSD), IFT,
and density profile.

2 Results and Discussions
This work provides new data from the molecular simulation of asphaltene,
linear saturated hydrocarbons, and water. The results are related
to the positioning of water molecules and hydrocarbon molecules, forming
an interface with asphaltene, similar to systems of water-in-oil emulsions
for rigidity and stability study of interfacial film. The initial
configuration was properly positioned in such a way as to form an
interface; the density profile data from the ternary mixture reporting
the positioning of molecules along a few time steps, IFT for rigidity
analysis of film with added asphaltene and without addition of asphaltene,
RDF data for the analysis of preferential orientation of aromatic
and aliphatic groups present in asphaltene molecules, and MSD data
for diffusive process analysis are the main results these work (diffusion
coefficients were obtained from an unweighted least-squares fit to
the MSD).

Figure 1 presents
the initial system configuration of linear-saturated hydrocarbons–water–asphaltene.
The data simulation of the positions of atoms can be found in the Supporting Information. The interface formation
is one of the main factors for the analysis of configurational energy;
in this work, the configurational energy is approximately equal to
5617.753 (kcal/mol), and these values have been obtained with a cutoff
boundary of long-range interactions equal to 12 Å. These data
show that simulations will be able to start properly without orbital
overlap occurring.11 The system density
data were close to 0.35 g/cm3. The results of density are
obtained considering the simulation box dimensions, in this work, lx, ly, and lz were 36.25, 36.25, and 72.50 Å, respectively, and atom number
2025. It becomes a most interesting science that the configuration
energy share is contributed by both the solvents and the third chemical
substance, and hence experimental verifications are done with a survismeter
device, which gives authentic data, where in real systems, asphaltene
occupy freedom to approach anywhere as per its interactive compatibility
with either solvent, as shown in Table 1.

Figure 2 shows profile
density data in the system with water–hydrocarbon–asphaltene.
The data in black, blue, and red are, respectively, of the decane
molecules, asphaltene, and water. At the initial simulations and at
the finished state, the permanence of the interface between water
and linear saturated hydrocarbons is normally realized; substances
with low chemical affinity and the asphaltene molecules are mostly
positioned closest to the decane molecules. It is possible that the carbon chains
of the asphaltene molecule must be with a special guidance for linear
saturated hydrocarbon molecules. The van der Waals interactions of
hydrocarbons (HC–decane) are dominated, and the polar groups
such as nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur are oriented toward the bulk
water by dipole–dipole forces.

Figure 2 Density profiles for decane–water–asphaltene
interface
systems (black; decane, red; water, and blue; asphaltene).

Figure 3 shows a
typical behavior analysis of IFT as a function of time, obtained by
calculations of IFT obtained through MD simulations and experimental
data. Therefore, the decrease in IFT systems cannot be explained by
the diffusion of asphaltene molecules to the interface because there
is possibly an asphaltene barrier that is fully connected to its self-aggregation.
The figure presents the data obtained from a model system of water,
decane, and asphaltene at 293 K. After the data reached the mechanical
equilibrium, the IFT value, indicating that in these conditions, would
tend to stabilize for long periods of time; this value would be for
asphaltene molecules that migrated to the HC–water interface.
The computational experiment duration was 107 ps corresponding
according to the computer configuration used for 2 days; this time
is considered the time of balance needed to obtain a set of IFTs.
The values obtained during the simulations are on the same order of
magnitude (∼45–60 mN/m) of the experiments using model
system (HC + water) with IFT using the pendant drop method, as shown
in Table 2, which gives
the tests high-reliability computing in proceedings of interaction
force fields (TIP3P (water), CHARMM, and OPLS (asphaltene) (decane));
another result that enhances the quality of the force fields used
is the pure-component density values for water molecules (1.002 and
0.75 g/cm3) to decane,;these values were obtained at the
simulations’ end through the mean of results obtained for different
computational experiments.

In Figure 4, the
central atom CH2 of the HC interaction data was formed
with sulfur of asphaltene (SM) atoms in each asphaltene molecule in
the first hydration layer up to ∼7 A, the second layer of the
pair CH2/SM is present in ∼11 A; this information
can be obtained also for CH3/SM pair that has the first
layer with ∼6 A, the second layer of the pair CH3/SM is present in ∼10 A and the third layer of the pair CH3/SM in ∼11 A. These large distances can relate the
geometry of linear decane molecules and the amount of asphaltene molecules
(when the algorithm traverses the whole phase space, there would be
a trouble in finding the grouping SM for possessing a single molecule
in the system, unlike the CH3 and CH2 groups
that have a reasonable amount; the RDF is defined as a local density).
The results also show that the pair CH3/SM has a greater
interaction because of the greater number of hydration layer of molecular
solvation. Interaction data and RDF can help elucidate the interface
position and asphaltene molecules polar groups orientation before
the hydrocarbon–water pair, with these new information related
to adsorption isotherms12 modeled using
this information. Therefore, it can be concluded that the aromatic
rings belonging to the asphaltene groups were oriented to the oil
phase because they have multiple solvation layers in the CH3/SM–CH2/SM groups and small interaction distances.
Further studies are necessary to support this affirmation.

Figure 5 and Table 3 are, respectively,
the mean-squared deviation of decane molecules, water, and asphaltene
at 293 K and diffusion coefficient values of asphaltene molecules
in the interface model of oil/water at various temperatures. For a
liquid–liquid interface composed of asphaltene molecules, hydrocarbons,
and water, it is expected that a decreased IFT with a rapid diffusion
and a rapid process of asphaltene molecule adsorption in the formed
interface is observed. This organization is independent of time and
is increasingly used for molecules’ relaxation processes in
the formed interface. An emulsified system and its stabilizing mechanism
is attributed to the formation of mechanically strong and hard film
or skin at the interface (O/W) which prevents a droplets union. The
skin is the asphaltene molecules association resulting in the liquid–liquid
interface and the multilayer formed (a kind of packaging process).13

a Diffusion coefficients can be calculated

The literature reports a relatively wide variation in the simulation
results from 0.01 × 10–10 to 8 × 10–10 m2/s.30−32Fobj—objective function values.

Asphaltene molecules may not have a classical aggregation
state
in solution (CMC). Instead, they form nanoaggregates and clusters
that are prone to reorganization and relaxation processes. However,
the colloidal stability studies of asphaltene molecules in crude oil,
when the system is not precipitated, prove that stability is related
to the asphaltene molecules’ aggregation state; these asphaltene
precipitations can be interpreted by physical forces, balance, mass,
and the strength of cross-association interactions between asphaltene
molecules and other substances in the system or other mixtures. In
actual fact, consolidated asphaltene films around the droplets of
emulsion do not coalesce after certain aging times. Obviously, adsorption
kinetics and MD studies play a key role in the mechanical properties
of films and an asphaltene adsorption with diffusion controlled at
short times with individual molecules, transitioning possibly to a
barrier-controlled regime in which larger aggregates are involved,14 all of which helps in understanding the interfacial
phenomena system assisting in the area development.

The asphaltene
molecules have small diffusion coefficient values
(D ≈ 10–10 m2/s) because adsorption mechanisms are not a diffusion-controlled
type because of the high molecular weight of these compounds. This
phenomenon has been described before and seems to be linked to the
Gibbs–Marangoni surface effects, in which the molecular diffusion
of surfactants between the bulk phase and interface plays a role during
droplet oscillations.6,15 By analyzing the effect of temperature
on the diffusion coefficient, the increasing temperature increases
the diffusion coefficient; thus, more gaps can be observed (the concentration
of vacancies is thermally activated) and more thermal energy will
be available; therefore, the rate of atomic diffusion increases with
temperature.16

By analyzing saturated
hydrocarbon effect on diffusion processes
analysis, it has not been possible to conclude that the number increase
of vacancies, that is, the use of small hydrocarbons would entail
increased diffusion processes by having greater space contact atoms
(vacancies). The MSD shows that decane molecules sweep areas larger
than water molecules, and asphaltene molecules seem to prey on the
interface forming a rigid film with the adsorption process (showing
the chart a constant area).

3 Conclusions
The
results generated with the Playmol package initial setup are
very important for the studies of liquid–liquid interface.
Density profile presents effectively the road traveled by the asphaltene
molecules; it was expected that the asphaltene molecules have preference
for decane molecules instead of water molecules, but it is important
to note that during the stimulation study of time steps, the asphaltene
molecules do not spread fully into the bulk-phase linear saturated
hydrocarbons (oil phase); therefore, we can interpret this situation
as the rigidity of the interfacial film is reinforced by the results
of MSD that presents constant values for asphaltene molecules. Asphaltene
molecules cannot sweep large areas that reinforce the theory of interfacial
film stiffness another important result and that is precedent in the
literature with Mikami et al.,4 which concerns
the influence of IFT with asphaltene molecules and no asphaltene molecules;
it seems that few asphaltene molecules affect very little, IFT that
is, the IFT with asphaltene–linear saturated hydrocarbons–water
molecules is very similar to IFT of linear saturated hydrocarbons–water
mixture. The asphaltene molecules have small diffusion coefficient
values (D ≈ 10–10 m2/s) because the adsorption mechanisms are not a diffusion-controlled
type because of the high molecular weight of these compounds. These
results are meant for studies of water/oil emulsion breaking.

4 Methodology
4.1 Molecular Simulation Protocol
The
simulations were conducted with the assistance LAMMPS package.17 The initial structure for the mixture of linear
saturated hydrocarbons + water + asphaltene was performed using the
Playmol package18 that generates initial
settings of any atoms and molecules in space, creating file system
structures. These systems have assumed an interfacial initial structure
between water and hydrocarbons molecules.19 The box of simulation contained one particle of asphaltene, 100
molecules of linear saturated hydrocarbons, and 300 molecules of water
in mixture with appropriate interfacial positioning. These settings
were used in MD simulations. Previously, the asphaltene molecules’
force field were obtained online using the SwissParam program; the
water molecules used parameters TIP3P20 and, for linear-saturated hydrocarbons, OPLS.21

Playmol was used to define 3D space by optimizing
the pairwise distances between atoms to avoid large van der Waals
repulsive forces. The PACKMOL allows the user to define the distance
constraint between atom pairs that are not to be disregarded. The
package is written in FORTRAN and was developed by researchers at
the ATOMS laboratory at UFRJ (Federal University of Rio de Janeiro).
The package was modified to read the asphaltene molecules CHARMM,22 water molecules TIP3P,20 and linear saturated hydrocarbons OPLS.21 The file format, including the contained atom types, generates a
final system of molecules that meets the pairwise distance constraint
and guarantees all molecules fit inside the user-defined MD cell.
Playmol works with containing hundreds of atoms, but it does require
equally vast hardware to accomplish such work. A random seed value
can be used to generate multiple MD cells for MD study. The Playmol
package input files were described in the Supporting Information.

In short, LAMMPS (http://lammps.sandia.gov) integrates
the motion equations of Newton for groups of atoms,
molecules, or macroscopic particles that interact through forces of
short or long range; for the integration of the equation of motion,
LAMMPS also uses the Verlet algorithm,23 which are recomputed every few time steps (new velocities and new
positions were obtained by integrating the motion equations). LAMMPS
uses neighboring list atoms to give a better efficiency in their simulations
and nearby particle monitoring. The ready for systems with particles that are repulsive
to form short distances that the density is not affected in a significant
way. LAMMPS was suggested as an MD simulation tool because of its
robust collection capabilities. LAMMPS has integrated the support
for MSD and RDF to study the movement of small atoms in interface
systems. LAMMPS contains a deformation feature that allows the researcher
to apply normal and shear strains to a system to calculate stresses
in interface for the proposed study. The LAMMPS requires an ensemble
associated with the boundary conditions imposed on the system under
study. The commonly studied simulation of liquids in systems is under
the canonical ensemble conditions, with temperature T, volume V, and N number of molecules
(NVT). This work used the NVT ensemble
to simulate mixtures of linear-saturated hydrocarbons + water + asphaltene,
1 ns integration time, temperature of 293 K, cutoff radius = 12 Å,
and long-range interactions by means of Ewald algorithm.24 The Playmol input files were described in the Supporting Information.

4.2 Density
Profile
The densities were
calculated using the space command “fix/spatial” LAMMPS
package, which summarizes the densities by atom and the averages for
slices of a specified thickness along a specified axis. Along the z-axis, the structural change that the asphaltene molecule
that turns away from the other axes x and y was chosen to observe. Figure 2 shows the general profile of mass density
of linear saturated hydrocarbons + water + asphaltene.

4.3 Interfacial Tension
The interfacial
rheology tension can be determined from the molecular dynamics.25−27 The interfacial rheology tension γ(t) is
defined as 1  where n is the axis normal
to the interface, and hence pnn and ptt are normal
and tangential constituents, respectively, of the pressure tensor, p. The integral must be carried out from the bulk location
of one phase to that of another phase. The IFT γ can be considered
by averaging γ(t) over the simulation time 2  

In our situation, because the z-axis is perpendicular
to the interfaces, eq 3 becomes 3  

4.4 Radial Distribution Function
The
RDF28 is a probability distribution of
definition an atom at a separation, r, from other
atoms (this methodology has the utility to analyze the probability
of separation between the atoms of interest). RDFs exist for both
equilibrium and nonequilibrium systems. LAMMPS has a well-organized
functionality to compute the RDF for a given cutoff distance radius.
The RDF command is appealed with a compute command. The following
example computes four RDFs, for 1-1, 1-2, 2-1, and 2-2 pairs. The
1-2 and 2-1 RDF should be identical (atom type).

Example: compute
RDF all RDF 100 1 1 1 2 2 1 2 2.

4.5 Mean
Square Displacement
MSD29 is a
quantity of the mean distance squared of
a particle or an atom. It is defined as 4  where (xi(t) – xi(0))2 is the distance
of particle i traveling over about time interval.
⟨...⟩
ensemble average is defined as the average of a quantity that is a
function of the individual states of the system. If we consider all
of the particles in the system, then we could write 5  where N is the number of
particles in the system.

4.6 Experimental Data of IFT
The IFTs
(γ) were measured at 296.65 K using the automated Teclis Tracker
(IT Concept, France) by axisymmetric interface profile analysis techniques.
This work was made the measurement of interface tension such that
pendant drops were in line with the optics and charge-coupled device
camera as the instrument to obtain visualization on the computer screen
(this equipment uses a software which has the resolution of equations
of Young–Laplace). The linear saturated hydrocarbon samples
were mixed with water in bulk. Syringe (10 μL) with an attached
u-shaped needle was prefilled with the linear saturated hydrocarbons
sample. The syringe was mounted on the syringe holder positioned above
the cuvette that contained 25 mL of water phase. The syringe was dropped
such that the needle was submerged in the cuvette’s water phase,
and a 25 μL drop (interfacial area, A = 41
mm2) expelled the sample in the needle tip. The IFTs were
instantaneously measured as a function of the drop aging time until
near-equilibrium values reached likewise; dynamic IFT γ(t) versus time t for linear saturated hydrocarbons–water
was measured. Currently, the new device which is most accurate and
streamlines several variables, especially the pressure and temperature
fluctuation, has been evolved, which produces most accurate results
without interference of the experiential forces which induce transitions
as the asphaltene has a larger number of pi conjugations.
