yields. The reaction of trans-[PtCl2(PhCN)2] with 2 equiv of [ArN=C(NHAr)2] in toluene
under reflux condition for 48 h afforded trans-[PtCl2{ArN=C(NHAr)2}2] [Ar = 2-MeC6H4 (8) and 2,4-Me2C6H3 (9)] in 90 and 45% yields, respectively.
Complexes 8 and 9 were separately refluxed
in MeOH for 8 h to afford six-membered cycloplatinated guanidines,

respectively, with concomitant formation of the respective guanidinium
salts, [(ArNH)3C]Cl, as the byproduct. Platinacycle 10 was treated with 2 equiv of AgTFA in CH2Cl2 at RT to afford six-membered cycloplatinated guanidine, [Pt{κ2(C,N)}(μ-TFA)]2 (12), in 94% yield. The new compounds were characterized
by analytical techniques and multinuclear NMR (1H, 13C, and 195Pt) spectroscopy, and further, molecular
structures of 10 compounds were determined by single-crystal X-ray
diffraction. The structural motif in 1·1/2CH2Cl2 and 3 is novel in that it contains
a planar six-membered [Pt{κ2(C,N)}] unit and a nonplanar eight-membered [Pt{κ2(N,O)}] ring, wherein OAc
and the guanidine ligands are linked through a N–H···O
hydrogen bond. The six-membered cycloplatinated structural motifs
present in 10/11·C7H8 and 12·CH2Cl2 are
also unprecedented in the literature. The number and nature of solution
species of new complexes were unambiguously investigated by detailed
NMR studies. The critical role of anions in Pt(II) precursors upon
the course of cycloplatination and thus the motifs in the products
were addressed. Plausible mechanisms of cycloplatination reactions
are discussed.

1 Introduction
Cycloplatinated
imines and related compounds have been widely studied
because of their relevance in C–H activation, organometallic
reactivity, and structural peculiarity and their utility as metallomesogens
and luminescent materials.1−10 Various Pt(II) precursors have been used to cycloplatinate N-donor
ligands of which a mixture of cis-[PtCl2(DMSO)2] and NaOAc was shown to be the most convenient
one for successful cycloplatination.1−5,8−12 The OAc– in cycloplatination is
believed to play a dual role as a nucleophile and as a base. Wu and
co-workers hypothesized that cycloplatination of ferrocenylimine with cis-[PtCl2(DMSO)2] in the presence
of NaOAc in toluene proceeds via a bicyclic transition state that
contained a coordinated OAc.7 The formation
of an acetate-substituted product before cycloplatination of amino
imines with a mixture of cis-[PtCl2(DMSO)2] and NaOAc was detected by 1H NMR spectroscopy,5b and such a product was isolated in a very minor
amount in one instance but without the knowledge that this is one
of the intermediates in OAc–-assisted cycloplatination.13 The study aimed at understanding an intricate
mechanism of cycloplatination of N-donor ligands in the absence of
an external base is also being pursued.14,15

Guanidines
and N-substituted guanidines were shown to act as neutral
and anionic N-donor ligands, respectively, exhibiting chelating and
bridging coordination modes in structurally characterized Pt(II) complexes.16−23 For the first time, sym N,N′,N″-triarylguanidines, [ArN=C(NHAr)2] (sym = symmetrical; Ar = Me-/OMe-substituted aryl rings), were
cycloplatinated with a mixture of cis-[PtCl2(DMSO)2] and NaOAc, thereby affording six-membered cycloplatinated N,N′,N″-triarylguanidines,
[Pt{κ2(C,N)}Cl(DMSO)]
(A). During the course of syntheses of A, cis-/trans-[PtCl2(DMSO){ArN=C(NHAr)2}] (B) and acetate-substituted product, cis-[Pt(OAc)Cl(DMSO){ArN=C(NHAr)2}] (C), were also isolated, and the latter product was shown to
be one of the intermediates for A.24 The isolation of C partly corroborated the
hypothesis put forward by Wu, Crespo, and co-workers for the mechanism
of cycloplatination of N-donor ligands mediated by NaOAc.5b,7 Recently, Vázquez-García, Vila, and co-workers have
shown through density functional theory calculations that during the
cycloplatination of hydrazine-based N-donor ligands with a mixture
of cis-[PtCl2(DMSO)2] and NaOAc,
indeed acetate enters into the coordination sphere of Pt(II) and forms
a Wheland intermediate before forming terdentate-cycloplatinated hydrazine,
[Pt{κ3(C,N,N)}Cl].25

Carboxylate-assisted
C–H activation of transition metals
has been intensively investigated through both experimental and computational
techniques.26 We cycloplatinated sym N,N′,N″-triarylguanidines
with cis-[PtX2(DMSO)2] (X =
OC(O)R; R = Me and CF3) with a view aimed at understanding
the influence of carboxylates in these precursors upon the structural
motifs of the resulting products. The difference in size of carboxylate
moieties in the aforementioned precursors allowed us to isolate two
distinct families of six-membered cycloplatinated guanidines, namely, 1–3 and 4–7; the motifs present
in these platinacycles were determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction
(SCXRD) and are unprecedented in the literature. Further, 8 and 9 were successfully transformed to six-membered
cycloplatinated guanidines 10 and 11, respectively,
through a pathway, which is unprecedented in the literature.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Syntheses of Pt(II) Precursors
trans-[PtCl2(PhCN)2] and cis-[PtX2(DMSO)2] (X = Cl and OAc)
were prepared
in yields greater than the literature yields as outlined in the Supporting Information.9,27−29 The metathesis reaction of cis-[PtCl2(DMSO)2] with 2 equiv of AgTFA in CH2Cl2 at room temperature (RT) for 24 h afforded cis-[Pt(TFA)2(DMSO)2] in 91% yield,
as illustrated in Scheme 1.

Scheme 1 2.2 Syntheses of Cycloplatinated
Guanidines and
Plausible Mechanism
The reactions of cis-[Pt(OAc)2(DMSO)2] with 2 equiv of [ArN=C(NHAr)2] (Ar = 2-MeC6H4 (LH22-tolyl) and 2,4-Me2C6H3 (LH22,4-xylyl) carried out separately
in toluene under reflux condition for 8 h afforded 1 and 2 as colorless crystalline materials in 82 and 84% yields,
respectively (see Scheme 2). The aforementioned reaction carried out with [ArN=C(NHAr)2] (Ar = 2-(MeO)C6H4; LH22-anisyl) afforded only Pt black as a decomposition
product, most likely due to greater basicity of the guanidine. The
salt metathesis reaction of 1 with AgTFA in CH2Cl2 at RT for 24 h afforded 3 as a colorless
crystalline material in 94% yield.

Scheme 2 The reactions of cis-[Pt(TFA)2(DMSO)2] with 1 equiv of LH22-tolyl and
its 4-tolyl analogue, LH24-tolyl and
LH22,4-xylyl, carried out separately
in toluene under reflux condition for 8 h afforded 4–6 as colorless crystalline materials in 78, 73, and 83% yields, respectively
(see Scheme 3). The
reaction of cis-[Pt(TFA)2(DMSO)2] with 1 equiv of LH22-anisyl in toluene
under reflux condition for 8 h followed by slow cooling of the reaction
mixture afforded [LH32-anisyl]TFA as
a colorless crystalline material in low yield. Removal of volatiles
from the reaction mixture and subsequent crystallization of the resulting
solid in ethanol afforded 7 in 36% yield. The yields
of 7 and [LH32-anisyl]TFA
increased to 74 and 81%, respectively, when the aforementioned reaction
was repeated with the Pt/guanidine ratio of 1:2 under otherwise identical
condition. The precipitation of the guanidinium salt only in this
reaction is probably ascribed to the greater basicity of LH22-anisyl. The reaction of cis-[Pt(OAc)2(DMSO)2] with 1 equiv of LH22-tolyl and the reaction of cis-[Pt(TFA)2(DMSO)2] with 2 equiv of the same guanidine under the condition identical
to that mentioned in Schemes 2 and 3 afforded 1 and 4 in 38 and 81% yields, respectively. This outcome suggests
that it is the nature of Pt(II) precursors and not the Pt/guanidine
ratio, which determines motifs in cycloplatinated guanidines.

Scheme 3 trans-[PtCl2(PhCN)2] was
treated with 2 equiv of LH22-tolyl and
LH22,4-xylyl separately in toluene under
reflux condition for 48 h to afford 8 and 9 in 90 and 45% yields, respectively, after column chromatographic
work-up on basic alumina using CHCl3 as the eluent (see Scheme 4). The aforementioned
reaction carried out with cis-[PtCl2(DMSO)2] and LH22-tolyl under otherwise
identical condition did not yield 8, presumably because
of the difference in steric/electronic factors around Pt(II) in the
precursor.

Scheme 4 The presence of variable number of guanidines
in 1–2 and 4–7 stimulated
us to isolate plausible intermediates
such as D and E, respectively (see Figure 1). The reaction of 8 with 2 equiv of AgOAc and the reaction of trans-[PtCl2(DMSO){ArN=C(NHAr)2}] (Ar = 2-MeC6H424) with 2 equiv of AgTFA in CH2Cl2 at RT for 24 and 3 h afforded 1 and 4 instead of D and E,
respectively. The formation of 1 and 4 in
the aforementioned reactions was confirmed by thin-layer chromatography
(CHCl3/MeOH; v/v 60/40) and 1H NMR spectroscopy
and through the isolation of 1 in 90% yield (see Method 1 4.12.1 under reactivity of 8 in Experimental
Section). The reaction of 8 with 2 equiv of NaOAc
in MeOH for 8 h under reflux condition also afforded 1 in 90% yield instead of D (see Method 2 4.12.2). The elusive
nature of D from our attempts suggests that unless the
N-donor ligand such as guanidine is sterically protected as illustrated
through the isolation of trans-[Pd(OC(O)R)2L2] (R = Me, Ph, and tBu;
L = [ArN=C(NHAr)2]; Ar = 2,5-Me2C6H3 (LH22,5-xylyl)),30 cycloplatination would eventually occur even
at RT because of the availability of both the acetate and the guanidine
ligands in proximal position. The reaction of cis-[Pt(TFA)2(DMSO)2] with sym N,N′,N″-triarylguanidines
either in 1:1 or 1:2 Pt/guanidine ratio can afford only the intermediate E and not the intermediate of type D because
of steric reasons.

Figure 1 Proposed intermediates D and E formed
during the course of formation of 1–2 and 4–7, respectively.

The mechanism of cyclopalladation of N,N-dimethylbenzylamine, L, with Pd(OAc)2 in CHCl3 was investigated by Ryabov and co-workers.31 The initially formed 1:2 adduct [Pd(OAc)2L2] was shown to dissociate one of the Ls, thereby generating
a 14-electron three-coordinate T-shaped intermediate, [Pd(OAc)2L], with trans geometry around Pd(II) initially and then to
cis geometry. The latter species undergoes cyclopalladation in the
rate-determining step to afford a five-membered cyclopalladated amine,
[Pd{κ2(C,N)}(μ-OAc)]2. Accordingly, we hypothesize that the intermediate D transforms to three-coordinate intermediate F, which subsequently transforms to another intermediate G before finally forming platinacycles such as 1 and 2, as illustrated in Scheme 5. The intermediate G upon cycloplatination
can liberate weakly acidic AcOH, which would fail to protonate the
nonplatinated guanidine, and hence, the imine N atom of nonplatinated
guanidine would recoordinate to Pt(II) to afford 1 rather
than forming an admixture of six-membered cycloplatinated guanidine,
[Pt{κ2(C,N)}(μ-OAc)]2, and the guanidinium acetate. The intermediate E upon losing dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) can give rise to three-coordinate
intermediate H, which upon trans → cis isomerization
can give another three-coordinate intermediate I. The
intermediate I upon cycloplatination can give rise to 4–7 (see Scheme 6).

Scheme 5 Scheme 6 Interestingly, the reaction of 8 with 1 equiv of NaOAc
in MeOH under reflux condition for 8 h afforded a mixture of 1 and [LH32-tolyl]Cl as colorless
solids and 10 as pale green solid in low yields (see Scheme 7). In this reaction,
perhaps all NaOAc was consumed to form 1 from 50% of 8 and the remaining 50% could have undergone cycloplatination
to afford 10 and the guanidinium salt. The observance
of three products in the aforementioned reaction helped us to reoptimize
synthetic routes for 10 and 11 as described
below.

Scheme 7 Complexes 8 and 9 were separately
refluxed
in methanol for 8 h to afford a mixture of 10 and [LH32-tolyl]Cl and a mixture of 11 and [LH32,4-xylyl]Cl, respectively
(see Scheme 7). Crystals
of 10 and 11 were separated from the respective
guanidinium salts by the hand-pick method and further purified by
crystallization from the CH2Cl2/toluene mixture
at RT. It is to be noted that heating trans-[PtCl2(APPY)2] (APPY = acetylmethylenetriphenylphosphorane,
Ph3PCHC(O)Me) in MeCN for 44 h afforded five-membered cycloplatinated
ylide, [Pt{κ2(C,C)}(μ-Cl)]2, and the salt, APPYHCl.32

It is to be noted that trans-[PtCl2(DMSO){ArN=C(NHAr)2}] (Ar = 2-MeC6H4) resisted cycloplatination in MeOH under reflux condition,
while 8 and 9 underwent cycloplatination
under identical condition to afford 10 and 11, respectively, which suggests that the dissociated guanidine acts
as a proton sponge, thereby driving the formation of respective platinacycles
and the guanidinium salts instead of platinacycle J (see Figure 2).

Figure 2 Putative cycloplatinated
guanidines anticipated to form in Scheme 7.

Adducts 8 and 9 upon reflux in
MeOH can
give rise to three-coordinate intermediates K and L with trans and cis geometry, respectively, around the Pt(II)
atom (see Scheme 8).
The intermediate L upon cycloplatination could liberate
strongly acidic HCl, which would protonate the imine N atom of nonplatinated
guanidine to afford 10/11 and the respective guanidinium
salts. The clean formation of 10/11 via this route is
facilitated primarily because of the formation of stable guanidinium
salts and their better solvation imparted by a polar protic solvent,
MeOH. Thus, the structural motifs present in 1/2, 4–7, and 10/11 are influenced by a single
or a combination of more than one of the following factors.1 The degree
of steric encumbrance around
the Pt(II) atom in the precursors with sterically less hindered cis-[Pt(OAc)2(DMSO)2]/trans-[PtCl2(PhCN)2] permitting entry of two guanidines
per Pt while sterically more hindered cis-[Pt(TFA)2(DMSO)2] permitting entry of only one guanidine
per Pt.

of acid liberated during
the course of cycloplatination.

3 Influence of N–H···O
hydrogen bond present in intermediates F and G. Noncovalent-directed syntheses of coordination compounds are an
emerging area in synthetic inorganic/organometallic chemistry.33



Scheme 8 Cycloplatinated guanidine 10 was poorly soluble in
organic solvents, and this precluded its solution characterization
by 195Pt and 13C NMR spectroscopy. Hence, 10 was derivatized with AgTFA in CH2Cl2 at RT for 24 h to afford more soluble 12 in 94% yield
(see Scheme 9).

Scheme 9 2.3 SCXRD Studies
Molecular structures
of cis-[Pt(TFA)2(DMSO)2], 1·1/2CH2Cl2/3, 4/7, [LH32-anisyl]TFA, 8, 10/11·C7H8, and 12·CH2Cl2 have been determined
by SCXRD and are shown in Figures 3–8. In cis-[Pt(TFA)2(DMSO)2], the Pt(II)
atom revealed cis geometry as anticipated due to more effective (d–d)
π bonding in this geometry.34 The
bond parameters around the Pt(II) atom in cis-[Pt(TFA)2(DMSO)2] are comparable with those found in the
related compound cis-[Pt(TFA)2((M,SS,SS)-p-tolyl-binaso)].35 Interestingly, the molecular structures of both cis- and trans-[Pd(TFA)2(S-DMSO)(O-DMSO)] have been reported, wherein
DMSO is shown to reveal linkage isomerism.36,37

In 1·1/2CH2Cl2 and 3, the Pt(II) atom is simultaneously
a part of the six-membered
[Pt{κ2(C,N)}] ring
and the eight-membered [Pt{κ2(O,N)}] ring with the latter ring intramolecularly stabilized
through >N–H···O=C< hydrogen bond
involving one of the NH protons of the nonplatinated guanidine and
carbonyl oxygen atom of OAc and TFA, respectively. The imine N atom
of the nonplatinated guanidine is placed cis to the Pt–C bond
of the C,N chelate, while OAc and
TFA are placed cis to the Pt–N bond, and thus, the Pt(II) atom
in both platinacycles revealed cisoid configuration.

The configuration
of Pd(II)/Pt(II) atoms in cyclometallated N-donor
ligands was explained by invoking steric factor and antisymbiosis/transphobia of two mutually trans-oriented ligands
and the influence of the latter factor was independently verified
in one study by theoretical calculations.4,24,38−40 The cisoid configuration
of the Pt(II) atom in 1·1/2CH2Cl2 and 3 is unfavorable from the point of view
of degree of transphobia, as hard imine N atom of
both the guanidines lies trans to each other. In a hypothetical transoid
configuration such as that illustrated in M, there would
be greater steric repulsion between 2-tolyl substituents of the imine
N atom of both platinated and nonplatinated guanidines (see Figure 9). Thus, steric factor
overrides the degree of transphobia in deciding the
geometry of the Pt(II) atom in 1·1/2CH2Cl2 and 3.

Figure 9 Possible geometrical isomers of 1–3.

Intriguingly, the six-membered
[Pt{κ2(C,N)}] ring
is planar in both 1·1/2CH2Cl2 and 3 and is coplanar
with the fused platinated 2-tolyl ring with the dihedral angle between
two six-membered rings being 0.8(2)° (1·1/2CH2Cl2) and 3.1(1)° (3). The prevalence
of a planar six-membered [Pd{κ2(C,N)}] ring in six-membered cyclopalladated N-donor
ligands was indicated and in one instance such a species was identified
by variable concentration 1H NMR spectroscopy.38,41 The nonplatinated guanidine in 1·1/2CH2Cl2 and 3 revealed anti–anti conformation
as reported for free LH22-tolyl.42

Unlike 1·1/2CH2Cl2 and 3, the six-membered [Pt{κ2(C,N)}] ring in 4 and 7 revealed
a pseudo-boat conformation. The flagpole atoms Pt1 and N3 lie at 0.58(1)
and 0.274(9) Å in 4 and at 0.62(1) and 0.26(1) Å
in 7, respectively, above the basal plane constituted
by N1, C1, C16, and C17. The bond parameters around the Pt(II) atom
in 4 and 7 are comparable with the respective
parameters reported for five-membered cycloplatinated N-donor ligands,
[Pt{κ2(C,N)}(OC(O)R)(L)]
(R/L = Me/DMSO43a and CF3/DMS43b).

The structure and bonding of the CN3 unit in cyclometallated sym N,N′,N″-triarylguanidines
can be better understood from the value of ρ.44 The ρ values for the structurally characterized compounds
prepared in the present investigation are listed in Table 1. The lone pair of the amino
N atoms can interact with the >C=N– π* orbital
of the guanidine moiety through n−π conjugation, and
for a maximum n−π conjugation, the ρ value should
be 1.0 and any downward deviation from this value indicates hampered
n−π conjugation. The ρ values for new compounds
listed in Table 1 are
much greater than the ρ value known for the respective free
guanidines.42 The ρ value of 1.00
for [LH32-anisyl]TFA is as anticipated
due to a maximum n−π conjugation, which arises because
of the presence of a charge-delocalized Y-conjugated species (angle
sum around CN3 carbon, ∑C ≈ 360°).45 The amino N atoms of the guanidine moieties
are planar (∑N ≈ 360°) in all compounds, further
supporting enhanced n−π conjugation in all new compounds
listed in Table 1.
The greater ρ value for the C,N chelate in 3 than
that observed for the same chelate in 1·1/2CH2Cl2 is attributed to the presence of more electronegative
TFA in the former complex. The greater ρ value for the C,N chelate in 11·C7H8 than that observed for the same chelate in 10 is attributed to the stronger binding of the imine N atom
of 2,4-xylyl guanidine moiety to the Pt(II) atom in the former. The
cation and the anion in [LH32-anisyl]TFA
are linked by a pair of N–H···O hydrogen bonds
and thus form an eight-membered ring characteristic of this type of
salts.46

b The values indicated are for the
nonplatinated guanidine.

Four distinct conformations, namely, trans syn syn–syn,
trans syn syn–anti, trans syn anti–syn, and trans syn
anti–anti, are possible for 8 and 9 depending upon (i) the disposition of the guanidine around the Pt(II)
atom, (ii) the orientation of the >C=N– unit of one
guanidine with respect to the orientation of the identical unit of
the second guanidine, and (iii) the orientation of the aryl ring of
the amino moieties with respect to the >C=N– unit
of
the guanidine (see Figure S1).30 Complex 8 revealed trans syn anti–anti
conformation as sterically hindered 2-tolyl substituent of the amino
moieties is better accommodated in this conformation. The observed
conformation is further stabilized by a pair of intramolecular N–H···Cl
hydrogen bonds and three intramolecular C–H···Cl
hydrogen bonds. The bond parameters around the Pt(II) atom in 8 are comparable with those parameters reported for the related trans-[PtCl2L2] (L = ferrocenyl-based
amidine and guanidine).23,28

Cyclometallated
five-membered N-donor ligands, [M{κ2(C,N)}(μ-X)]2 (M/X
= Pd and Pt/Cl, Br, or I), are known to exist as either cisoid or
transoid conformer in the solid state, but the former conformer is
not possible for 10 and 11·C7H8 as there would be a repulsive interaction between two
=NAr units of the guanidine ligands. However, 10 and 11·C7H8 can exist as
five different conformers, namely, transoid syn planar, transoid anti
planar, transoid syn puckered (or butterfly-like), transoid anti puckered
(or bat-like), and transoid puckered, as illustrated in Figure 10. Transoid syn
planar, transoid syn puckered, and transoid anti puckered possess
a pseudo-C2 symmetry, which passes right
across the center of the [Pt(μ-Cl)2Pt]2+ ring, while transoid anti planar possesses an inversion symmetry.
Transoid puckered conformer does not possess any such symmetry.

Figure 10 Possible
conformers of 10 and 11·C7H8.

In the solid state, 10 revealed a transoid anti planar
conformation, while 11·C7H8 revealed transoid anti puckered conformation. Thus, the four-membered
[Pt(μ-Cl)2Pt]2+ ring in 10 is planar, while that in 11·C7H8 is puckered. The dihedral angle between two mean planes constituted
by Pt1–Cl1–Cl1# and Pt1#–Cl1–Cl1# triangles
in 10 is 0.0(1)°, and the corresponding dihedral
angle in 11·C7H8 is 45.1(1)°.
As a result, the nonbonded Pt···Pt distance, 3.6479(4)
Å, in 10 is longer than the corresponding distance
in 11·C7H8 (3.3869(3) Å).
The Pt–Cl1# distance of 2.458(2) Å (10) and
the corresponding distances of 2.458(1) Å, 2.449(1) Å (11·C7H8), both of which are trans
to the Pt–C(aryl) bond, are longer than the second Pt–Cl
distance(s) [2.325(2) Å (10) and 2.324(1) Å
and 2.326(1) Å (11·C7H8)] because of greater trans influence of the platinated carbon of
the aryl ring in the C,N chelate. It is to be noted that six-membered
cyclopalladated 2-tolyl and 2,4-xylyl guanidines [Pd{κ2(C,N)}(μ-Br)]2 revealed transoid syn puckered and transoid anti puckered conformations,
respectively.39 The difference in the conformations
of 10 and its Pd(II) counterpart probably arises because
of the difference in size of the atoms in the [M(μ-X)2M]2+ (M/X = Pt/Cl and Pd/Br) ring and difference in the
packing forces.

In principle, 12·CH2Cl2 can exist as three different conformers, namely, transoid
in–in,
transoid in–out, and transoid out–out, as we have shown
for six-membered cyclopalladated guanidines, [Pd{κ2(C,N)}(μ-OC(O)R)]2 (R = Me, CF3, and tBu).38,39 In the solid state, 12·CH2Cl2 revealed transoid in–in conformation as analogously revealed
by six-membered cyclopalladated 2-tolyl- and 2,4-xylyl guanidines,
[Pd{κ2(C,N)}(μ-OAc)]2.39

Cyclometallated N-donor
ligands are known since the pioneering
work of Cope and Siekman who published their seminal paper in 1965.47 A number of known structurally characterized
five-membered cycloplatinated N-donor ligands of type I shown in Figure 11 are greater than their six- and seven-membered counterparts.1,9,12,15a,24,43,48 Further structurally characterized five-membered
cycloplatinated N-donor ligands of types II and III are scarce,2−4,49−52 while their six- and seven-membered counterparts are presently unknown.
Thus, to the best of our knowledge, 10/11·C7H8 and 12·CH2Cl2 represent the first crystallographically characterized six-membered
cycloplatinated N-donor ligands of types II and III to be reported in the literature. Further, 1·1/2CH2Cl2 and 3 represent
the first structurally characterized planar six-membered cyclometallated
N-donor ligands of this kind to be reported in the literature.

2.4 Spectroscopic Characterization
2.4.1 Attenuated Total Reflection IR (ATR–IR)
Spectroscopy
Pt(II) guanidine complexes prepared in the present
investigation were characterized by IR and multinuclear NMR (1H, 13C, 19F, and 195Pt) spectroscopy,
elemental analyses, and mass spectrometry. IR spectroscopy is a powerful
tool to unambiguously assign the coordination modes of the carboxylate
moiety in metal carboxylate complexes.53 The IR spectrum of cis-[Pt(TFA)2(DMSO)2] revealed two bands at 1722 and 1400 cm–1 assignable to νa(OCO) and νs(OCO),
respectively. From the Δν = νa(OCO) –
νs(OCO) value of 322 cm–1 and from
the fact that this value is greater than the Δν value
reported for NaTFA (223 cm–1),53 the presence of a monodentate coordination mode for TFA
in cis-[Pt(TFA)2(DMSO)2] is
confirmed. The IR spectrum of cis-[Pt(TFA)2(DMSO)2] also revealed a band at 1144 cm–1 assignable to the ν(SO) stretch of S-bonded DMSO.37,54

The IR spectra of 1–3 revealed a pair
of bands at 1622 and 1386 cm–1 (1·1/2CH2Cl2), 1624 and 1387 cm–1 (2), and 1676 and 1393 cm–1 (3) assignable to νa(OCO) and νs(OCO),
respectively. The Δν values of 236, 237, and 283 cm–1 indicated the presence of hydrogen-bonded monodentate
OAc55 in 1·1/2CH2Cl2 and 2 and hydrogen-bonded monodentate
TFA in 3, respectively. The Δν values of
326, 315, 310, and 322 cm–1 for 4–7, respectively, indicated the presence of monodentately coordinated
TFA, while the Δν value of 130 cm–1 for 12·CH2Cl2 indicated the presence
of bridging bidentately coordinated TFA. The IR spectra of all other
new Pt(II) complexes and guanidinium salts prepared in the present
investigation revealed bands at anticipated positions assignable to
the ν(NH), ν(C=N), and ν(SO) stretches, whichever
is applicable.

2.4.2 NMR Spectroscopy
The Me/OMe substituents
in aryl rings of guanidines in new complexes reported in this manuscript
are useful not only in modulating their solubility in low polar solvents
but also in serving as the NMR (1H and 13C)
spectroscopic handle to understand the number and nature of solution
species. Further, different substitution patterns of aryl rings in
guanidines afforded different information in solution, which enabled
us to better interpret the number and nature of solution species.

195Pt NMR spectroscopy is a powerful technique to understand
the coordination environment around the metal in platinum(II) complexes
because of its favorable NMR properties.56 Intramolecular cycloplatination of N-donor ligands results in upfield
δ(195Pt) NMR shifts.5b,12,24,56,57 Further, δ(195Pt) window is wider, covering about
6000 ppm interval, which permits one to distinguish even one set of
geometrical isomers and conformers of [C,E] platinacycles (E = N and C) without any ambiguity.24,40 Hence, the new complexes in solution were characterized by 195Pt NMR spectroscopy.

195Pt NMR spectra
of cis-[PtX2(DMSO)2] (X = OAc
and TFA) revealed a singlet at δ(195Pt) −3086
and −3094 ppm, respectively, and
these values are more downfield-shifted than that reported for cis-[PtCl2(DMSO)2] (δ(195Pt) −3450 ppm29) because of the
presence of more electron-withdrawing carboxylate moieties in the
former two complexes. 195Pt NMR spectra of 1–3 revealed a pair of signals for each platinacycle at δ(195Pt) −2784 and −2718 ppm (intensity ratio =
1.00:0.55), −2783 and −2724 ppm (intensity ratio = 1.00:0.62),
and −2818 and −2879 ppm (intensity ratio = 1.00:0.75),
respectively, revealing the presence of two solution species. 1H NMR spectra of 1 and 2 revealed
the presence of two species in about 1.00:0.65 and 1.00:0.57 ratios,
respectively, and the presence of two solution species is in agreement
with the results obtained from 13C NMR spectroscopy (see
the Supporting Information). Interestingly,
the 1H NMR spectrum of 3 revealed the presence
of four species in about 1.00:0.69:0.23:0.10 ratio, and the presence
of four solution species was further supported by 13C and 19F NMR spectroscopy.

From the foregoing discussion,
we suggest the presence of a maximum
of four solution species for 1–3, and these four
species are assigned to four conformers, namely, syn–syn, syn–anti,
anti–syn, and anti–anti, as illustrated in Figure 12. The nonplatinated
guanidine in the solid-state isomer of 1 and 3 can decoordinate in solution to afford an acyclic intermediate N because of destabilizing transphobia effect
(see Figure 13). Subsequently,
the nonplatinated guanidine in the intermediate N can
undergo amine–imine tautomerization58 to afford another intermediate O, which would recoordinate
to the Pt(II) atom through the imine N atom to afford a mixture of
conformers illustrated in Figure 12. The aryl substituent of the N atoms, which are not
involved in intramolecular N–H···O hydrogen
bond in intermediates N and O, is free to
undergo incremental N–Caryl bond rotation, and hence,
formation of three more conformers in addition to the solid-state
conformer via intermediates N and O is likely
possible.

Figure 12 Possible conformers of 1–3 in solution. The
substituents on the aryl rings have been removed for clarity.

Figure 13 Interconversion of intermediates N and O via amine–imine tautomerization.

To better understand the nature
and number of solution species
of 1–3, platinacycle 13 was isolated
(see Figure 14). The 1H NMR spectrum of 13 is anticipated to reveal
the presence of only one conformer in solution because of the presence
of more symmetrical 4-tolyl rings. Thus, the 1H NMR spectrum
of 13 revealed six singlets in a 1:1:1:1:2:1 ratio for
CH3 protons of tolyl rings and the acetate moiety (see
the Supporting Information). Further, a
downfield-shifted signal was observed for the NH proton (δ =
11.42 ppm), which is involved in intramolecular N–H···O
hydrogen bond. Thus, the 1H NMR spectrum of 13 clearly supported our hypothesis that more than one solution species
of 1–3 arises from four distinct conformers illustrated
in Figure 12.

Figure 14 Platinacycle 13 (Ar = 4-MeC6H4) which exists as a
single isomer in solution.

195Pt NMR spectra of 4–7 revealed
one peak each at δ(195Pt) −3650, −3674,
−3655, and −3657 ppm, respectively, indicating the presence
of a single solution species, and this conclusion was independently
verified by 1H, 13C, and 19F NMR
spectroscopy. As anticipated, the δ(195Pt) value
of 7 is deshielded than that reported for its chloro
analogue, [Pt{κ2(C,N)}Cl(DMSO)] (δ(195Pt) −3737 ppm24), because of the presence of more electron-withdrawing
TFA in the former complex. The δ(195Pt) values reported
for 4–7 are also upfield-shifted than that reported
for five-membered cycloplatinated ferrocenylamine, [Pt{κ2(C,N)}(OAc)(DMSO)] (δ(195Pt) −2078 ppm43a) not
only due to the difference in the [Pt{κ2(C,N)}] ring size but also due to the difference
in the nature of ligands. The presence of one solution species for 4 contrasts with the presence of seven solution species reported
for its chloro analogue, [Pt{κ2(C,N)}Cl(DMSO)] (δ(195Pt) −2645
(minor), −2710 (major), −2760 (minor), −2839
(minor), −2851 (minor), −2958 (major), and −2995
(minor) ppm24). This spectral difference
in the number of solution species arises because of larger size of
the TFA in platinacycle 4. As a result, only one conformer,
α3, out of six possible conformers (α1, α2, α3,
β1, β2, and β324) is
possible for 4 even in solution. The α and β
nomenclature indicates conformers that arise due to three distinct
orientations of DMSO with respect to the plane of the Pt(II) atom
and two distinct orientations of the o-substituted
aryl ring in the =NAr unit of the C,N chelate with respect
to the basal plane of the boat, respectively.

The 195Pt NMR spectrum of 8 revealed one
peak at δ(195Pt) −1799 ppm, while 1H NMR spectra measured in both CDCl3 and C6D6 revealed the presence of two species in about 1.00:0.66
and 1.00:0.50 ratios, respectively. The presence of two solution species
for 8 in CDCl3 was also independently verified
by 13C NMR spectroscopy. Complex 9 also revealed
the presence of two solution species as revealed by 195Pt, 1H, and 13C spectroscopy (see Experimental Section). The 195Pt NMR
spectrum of 9 revealed two singlets at δ(195Pt) −1818 (minor) and −1804 (major) ppm, suggesting
the presence of two solution species. The δ(195Pt)
shifts observed for 8 and 9 are comparable
with those shifts reported for the related 1:2 adducts (δ(195Pt) −1887, −2020, and −1872 ppm).23,28,59 The major and minor solution
species of 8 and 9 are assigned to trans
syn anti–anti, the solid-state isomer, and trans syn anti–syn
isomer with the latter isomer arising from the former via the restricted
C–N(H)Ar single bond rotation, as illustrated in Scheme 10.

Scheme 10 Two halves of the molecule in all conformers except transoid
puckered
for 10 and 11 are equivalent because of
molecular symmetry (see Figure 10). We would expect a maximum of three singlets for
CH3 protons of the guanidine ligand for 10 and a maximum of six singlets for the same protons of the guanidine
for 11 when the conformers possess either C2 or inversion symmetry for each isomer assuming that
there are no overlapping CH3 signals. The transoid puckered
conformer is expected to reveal a maximum of 6 singlets for CH3 protons of the guanidine ligand for 10 and a
maximum of 12 singlets for the same protons of the guanidine for 11 assuming that there are no overlapping CH3 signals.

Platinacycle 10 is only sparingly soluble in common
deuterated NMR solvents, which precluded its characterization by 195Pt and 13C NMR spectroscopy. The 1H NMR spectrum of 10 in CDCl3 revealed the
presence of three species in about 1.00:0.78:0.50 ratio as estimated
from the integrals of CH3 protons of the guanidine ligand.
The 1H NMR spectrum of 10 revealed three singlets
for the first isomer, three singlets for the second isomer, and two
singlets for the third isomer assignable to the CH3 protons,
thus accounting for six Me groups of the guanidine ligand. Thus, the
three isomers in solution possess either C2 or inversion symmetry. However, better solubility of 11 in common deuterated NMR solvents enabled us to characterize it
by 1H, 195Pt, and 13C NMR spectroscopy.
The 195Pt NMR spectrum of 11 revealed three
peaks at δ(195Pt) −2863, −2854, and
−2848, indicating the presence of three solution species. The
three solution species observed for 10 and 11 contrasts with the single solution species reported for five-membered
cycloplatinated imines, [Pt{κ2(C,N)}(μ-Cl)]2, which were shown
to reveal a single δ(195Pt) shift (δ(195Pt) range: −3108 to −3165 ppm) in solution.3b,3c

The 1H NMR spectrum of 11 in C6D6 revealed the presence of two species in about
1.00:0.96
ratio as estimated from the integrals of CH3 protons of
the guanidine ligand. Five singlets were observed for CH3 protons of the guanidine moiety in one isomer (11a),
and nine singlets were observed for the same protons of the second
isomer (11b), thus accounting for 12 Me groups of the
guanidine ligand, which clearly revealed that isomer 11a possesses either C2 or inversion symmetry,
while isomer 11b does not possess either of the two.
The 1H NMR spectrum of 11 in CDCl3 revealed the presence of three isomers 11a, 11b, and 11c in about 1.00:1.13:0.91 ratio, respectively,
as estimated from the integrals of CH3 protons of the ligand.
The 1H NMR spectrum revealed four singlets for CH3 protons for both 11a and 11c while seven
singlets for the same protons of 11b, thus accounting
for 12 Me groups of the guanidine ligand for each species. Thus, it
appears that both isomers 11a and 11c possess
either C2 symmetry or inversion symmetry
or one of these symmetries. Further, isomer 11b appears
to possess neither C2 symmetry nor inversion
symmetry, thereby referring to the transoid puckered conformer.

From the solution behavior of 11 in C6D6, we suggest the presence of any two conformers, one originating
from either transoid syn puckered or transoid anti puckered and the
other isomer arising from transoid puckered and the conformational
equilibria in this case arise only due to the six-membered [Pt{κ2(C,N)}] ring inversion as
C6D6 is noncoordinating. We suggest that the
crystals of solid-state conformers upon dissolution in weakly coordinating
CDCl3 undergo a bridge-splitting reaction to afford solvent-coordinated
intermediates, P and Q, respectively, and
these intermediates are free to undergo six-membered [Pt{κ2(C,N)}] ring inversion in
solution before reforming any of the three conformers illustrated
in Figure 10 (see
also Figure 15). The
conformational equilibria in solution are made possible for 10 and 11 because the Pt–Cl bond, which
is trans to the Pt–C bond, is weaker because of greater trans
influence of the platinated carbon. 1H, 195Pt,
and 13C NMR spectra of 12 in solution indicated
the presence of a single species. The δ(195Pt) −2555
ppm value observed for 12 is downfield-shifted when compared
to those δ(195Pt) shifts of 11 because
of the presence of more electron-withdrawing TFA bridges in the former.

intermediates possibly formed in solution for 10 (P) and 11 (Q) in

3 Conclusions
Cycloplatination
of several guanidines with Pt(II) carboxylate
precursors was reported under facile reaction condition without recourse
to the use of an external base to afford either 1 and 2 or 4–7 depending upon the carboxylates
in the precursors. Thermolysis of 8 and 9 in MeOH under reflux condition afforded cycloplatinated 10 and 11, respectively. Complex 10 was further
derivatized with AgTFA to afford 12. The yields of
all complexes except one complex are good to very good. The new complexes
were characterized by analytical, IR, and multinuclear NMR (1H, 13C, 19F, and 195Pt) spectroscopic
techniques, and the structural motifs present in 10 complexes were
unambiguously determined by SCXRD. To the best of our knowledge, the
structural motifs present in some of the new complexes are unprecedented
in the literature. The number and nature of solution species of new
complexes were identified by multinuclear NMR spectroscopy. We have
shown that the steric factor of anions in Pt(II) precursors is critical
in determining the course of cycloplatination and hence structural
motifs of the products.

To the flask was added 35 mL CH2Cl2, and the
reaction mixture was stirred for 24 h. Subsequently, the reaction
mixture was filtered through a 0.2 μM syringe filter. The volatiles
from the filtrate were removed under vacuum to afford the solid. The
solid was subsequently dissolved in acetone and layered with ethanol,
and the resulting solution was stored at RT for 3 days to afford the
title complex as colorless crystals. Yield: 91% (62.0 mg, 0.107 mmol).

Complex 8 (100 mg, 0.108 mmol) was dispersed in methanol
(20 mL) in a 50 mL RB flask, and the resulting heterogeneous mixture
was refluxed for 8 h and cooled. During the course of the reaction,
yellow solid slowly disappeared with concomitant formation of pale
green solid. The volatiles from the reaction mixture were evaporated
under vacuum to afford a solid. The solid was dissolved in CH2Cl2 (20 mL), concentrated under vacuum to about
3 mL, layered with toluene (6 mL), and stored at RT for 1 week to
afford 10 as light green crystals and [LH32-tolyl]Cl as white raisin-like solid. Compound 10 was separated from the mixture by the hand-pick method,
and both 10 and the salt were recrystallized from CH2Cl2/toluene mixture at RT separately over a period
of 1 week. These crystals were subsequently used for other characterization
including SCXRD in the case of 10.
