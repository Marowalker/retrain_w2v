A simple and practical method to
access a variety of benzimidazol-2-ones
is reported here. A series of N-alkyl-substituted
benzimidazol-2-ones were synthesized by decarbonylative ring contraction
starting from corresponding quinoxalinediones for the first time.
The utility of the method has been demonstrated by synthesizing recently
approved controversial drug flibanserin (Addyi) and a urea analogue
of marine antibiotic natural product hunanamycin-A.

==== Body
Introduction
Benzimidazol-2-ones 1 are an important class of heterocycles
and a privileged scaffold in medicinal chemistry. They consist of
cyclic urea fused with the aromatic backbone, which can potentially
interact in a biological system by various noncovalent interactions
such as hydrogen bonding and π stacking. Benzimidazolone derivatives
exhibit a wide range of biological activities, and they are useful
in treating various diseases including cancer, type II diabetes, central
nervous system disorders, pain management, and infectious disease.1 Selected compounds embedded with a benzimidazol-2-one
moiety along with their use are captured in Figure 1. It is worth mentioning that oxatomide drug
with a benzimidazol-2-one core was approved for marketing a few years
ago.2a Very recently, US Food and Drug
Administration approved a new drug called flibanserin for the treatment
of hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD) in females, which contains
benzimidazol-2-one motif.2b

important benzimidazolones.

Results and Discussion
Considering interesting biological
activity and the importance
of this scaffold, we sought to develop a new and efficient method
for the preparation of benzimidazolones. Literature search revealed
that most of the methods for the synthesis of a benzimidazol-2-one
core rely on carbonylation of benzene-1,2-diamines 2 or
cyclization of appropriately substituted phenyl urea 3. The carbonylation reaction of benzene-1,2-diamines requires the
use of phosgene, triphosgene, or carbonyl diimidazole.3 To avoid the use of such hazardous chemicals, alternative
procedures using transition metals (palladium4 and copper5)-catalyzed intramolecular 3 or intermolecular 4 cyclization or C–H
oxidation6 reactions were developed. Some
of the interesting interconversions of heterocyclic rings for the
synthesis of benzimidazol-2-ones are also reported. According to Zhou’s
work, aminomethylene benzimidazoles 5 and alkyl halide
in the presence of a base produced benzimidazolones.7a The Mamedov group synthesized highly functionalized N-pyrrolylbenzimidazol-2-ones through the rearrangement
of substituted quinoxalin-2(1H)-ones 6.7b In this regard, it is noteworthy to
highlight the efforts by Bolm and co-workers for the development of
a mild method to access such heterocycles.8 Moreover, work on N-arylated and N-alkylated benzimidazol 2-ones is less explored. Here, we have developed
a mild method for the decarbonylation of easily accessible quinoxalinediones97 to form benzimidazol-2-ones using
potassium hydroxide (KOH) in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). To the best
of our knowledge, this transformation has not been reported in the
literature (Scheme 1).

Scheme 1 Selected Routes to Benzimidazol-2-ones and Our Work
As part of one of the ongoing
projects in our group, we were interested
in the synthesis of tetracyclic N-heterocyclic carbenes10 from the corresponding tetracyclic compound 10 which in turn was readily prepared from quinoxalinedione
through prenylation followed by Friedel–Crafts alkylation (Scheme 2). We have attempted hydrolysis of 1,1,10,10-tetramethyl-1,2,3,8,9,10-hexahydropyrazino[1,2,3,4-mn][1,10]phenanthroline-5,6-dione 10 using
KOH and DMSO at room temperature to have the corresponding diamine.
Fortuitously, a new product was isolated from the reaction, which
showed similar proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectrum with ∼0.3
ppm difference with respect to starting dicarbonyl compound 10, but carbon nuclear magnetic resonance (13C
NMR) spectrum showed a considerable difference in most of the peaks
including the presence of one peak for carbonyl carbon at δ
152.6 ppm (Figure 2). The assigned structure was further supported by high-resolution
mass spectrometry analysis (271.1798) which corresponds to a ring-contracted
product 10a. The structure of 10a was further
confirmed by comparing its spectral data where it was synthesized
differently.10 Having made this interesting
observation, compound 11 was chosen for further optimization
and subjected to various conditions listed in Table 1. By changing the base, equivalent, and temperature,
we were settled with the optimized condition as 10 equiv of KOH in
DMSO at room temperature. After optimization, we tested the scope
of the method with different substrates and prepared several substituted
quinoxalinediones. The results along with the yields of the isolated
products are summarized in Table 2. Initially, we have subjected different N-alkylated 6,7-dimethyl 1,4-dihydroquinoxaline-2,3-diones (compounds 13–18) for the decarbonylative ring contraction and
found that all of them are well-tolerated and gave good yields. To
our surprise, attempts to afford the desired product in the case of N-unsubstituted quinoxaline-2,3-diones (12 and 25) were unsuccessful. This may be due to the fact that secondary
amides exist in their tautomeric form, that is, imidic acid, probably
which hindered the hydrolysis step. Aromatic ring without any substitution
also gave a good yield of products (compounds 19 and 20). Methoxy substitution on the aromatic ring (compounds 21–24) was also tolerated but obtained moderate yield
along with the recovery of the starting material. We could not improve
the yield by increasing the reaction time to 36 h. Furthermore, to
broaden the substrate scope, we have synthesized unsymmetrical N,N di-substitution on the quinoxaline-2,3-dione
core which is part of our antibacterial research interest.11 All of these compounds with unsymmetrical substitution
were subjected to previously optimized condition and resulted in better
yields of the desired products (compounds 26–33). Almost in all cases, we have observed the formation ∼5–10%
of the corresponding diamine (resulting from complete hydrolysis).
As a direct application and to demonstrate the usefulness of the method
developed, we decided to perform late-stage transformation on hunanamycin
A 34, an antibiotic natural product derived from marine
source, which contains a quinoxaline-2,3-dione core.12 Hunanamycin showed potent antibiotic activity against Salmonella enterica which causes food poisoning.13 Pleasingly, the reaction went smoothly to furnish
benzimidazol-2-one 35, a new analogue of hunanamycin
A in one step. All of the spectral data are in agreement with the
drawn structure (Scheme 3).

Contraction To Access Benzimidazol-2-ones
The same methodology was applied for the synthesis
of flibanserin,
also known as “female viagra”, which is the first approved
medication for treating HSDD in women and is classified as a multifunctional
serotonin agonist antagonist.14,15 Our synthesis of flibanserin
commenced with 1-benzyl-1,4-dihydroquinoxaline-2,3-dione 36,16 which was reacted with known chloride 37(17) under the basic condition
in DMF to give the desired product 38 in good yield.
Compound 38 was subjected for the decarbonylative cyclization
under the optimized condition to afford the product 39 in 59% yield. Finally, the benzyl group was deprotected using trifluoromethanesulfonic
acid in toluene under microwave irradiation,8b,18 which gave flibanserin in excellent yield (Scheme 4). The final product was isolated as HCl
salt, and all of the spectral data are in agreement with the published
data.15c

Conclusions
We have developed a mild and new protocol
for the synthesis of
benzimidazol-2-ones from quinoxalinediones through decarbonylation.
The present methodology can be an addition to the toolbox to prepare
benzimidazolones, and it will be useful in medicinal chemistry, particularly,
late-stage functionalization of natural products, drug scaffolds,
or an intermediate containing quinoxaline-2,3-diones. As direct application
of this method, we have successfully developed a new route for the
synthesis of recently approved drug flibanserin and a urea analogue
of antibiotic natural product hunanamycin A. Later application demonstrates
the utility of the present method in late-stage functionalization.
