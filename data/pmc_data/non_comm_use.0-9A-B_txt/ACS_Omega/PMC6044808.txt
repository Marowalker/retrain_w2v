The
topoisomerase I inhibitors SN-38 and camptothecin (CPT) have
shown potent anticancer activity, but water insolubility and metabolic
instability limits their clinical application. Utilizing carbon nanotubes
as a protective shell for water-insoluble SN-38 and CPT while maintaining
compatibility with aqueous media via a carboxylic acid-functionalized
surface can thus be a strategy to overcome this limitation. Through
hydrophobic–hydrophobic interactions, SN-38 and CPT were successfully
encapsulated in carboxylic acid functionalized single-walled carbon
nanotubes and dispersed in water. The resulting cell proliferation
inhibition and drug distribution profile inside the cells suggest
that these drug-encapsulated carbon nanotubes can serve as a promising
delivery strategy for water-insoluble anticancer drugs.

Introduction
The FDA-approved topoisomerase
I inhibitor irinotecan is used to
treat colon and small lung cancer.1−3 Its active metabolite
SN-38 and analogue camptothecin (CPT) show potent anticancer efficacy
and are often considered two of the most effective anticancer agents.4,5 Their cytotoxic effect is exerted by blocking the action of topoisomerase
I, which is essential for relaxing DNA supercoiling during the cell
replication cycle.5,6 However, the water insolubility
and poor pharmacological profile of SN-38 and CPT significantly restrict
their clinical applications.7,8 One approach to overcome
this problem is to enhance the drugs’ pharmacological profiles
by encapsulating them in polymers or nanomaterials functioning as
a water-compatible outer shell.9−11 Due to their needle-like shape
and high aspect ratio, functionalized carbon nanotubes (fCNTs) allow
endocytosis or direct penetration across cell membranes.12−16 In addition, fCNTs trap hydrophobic molecules in their inner space
via hydrophobic–hydrophobic interactions.17−19 The carboxylic
functional groups on the surface allow their free dispersion in aqueous
media without surfactants or dispersants and can serve as a conjugation
site for attaching targeting moieties. Moreover, many studies report
that compared to nonfunctionalized carbon nanotubes, fCNTs show enhanced
clearance20 and decreased toxicity,21 and can even can be decomposed inside the human
body.22,23 Biodistribution of fCNTs can also be tracked
with endogenous fluorescence emission in the NIR-II window.24,25 Therefore, hydrophobic drug molecule encapsulation in fCNTs is a
good delivery strategy, as it can protect drugs from external decomposing
agents while maintaining compatibility with the aqueous media with
traceability. Several careful simulations as well as experimental
studies on encapsulating small molecules including drugs in carbon
nanotubes have been demonstrated.26−29 Although these studies have shown
that hydrophobic molecules can be successfully entrapped in the endohedral
space of CNTs by simple incubation,17,19 studies on
the actual delivery of CNT-encapsulated hydrophobic drugs are rare.
To enhance SN-38 and CPT delivery and address this unmet research
need, we conducted systematic studies on SN-38/CPT encapsulation in
fCNTs. In addition, the dispersibility of fCNTs after drug encapsulation
in water and the stability in aqueous media and distribution in cells
of the encapsulated drugs after delivery were carefully examined to
verify the potential of CNT-encapsulated anticancer drugs.

Results
SN-38
and CPT Encapsulation in fCNTs and Their Dispersion in
Aqueous Media
SN-38 and CPT were incubated with fCNT soot
to trap them within the inner cavity of the fCNTs. SN-38 and CPT at
1 mg/mL in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) were incubated with fCNTs for
120 h. Then, the samples were centrifuged and the supernatant was
collected to measure the amount of unencapsulated SN-38 and CPT (F1, Figure 1A,B). Drugs@fCNTs
were further washed, and the supernatant was collected after each
wash (F2 and F3). The data show that F1 contains the majority of the
unencapsulated SN-38 and CPT, followed by F2 and F3. According to
an estimation, 48.82 and 100.91 μg of SN-38 and CPT were encapsulated
on average in 1 mg of fCNTs, respectively (Figure 1A,B). After the encapsulation process, fCNTs
containing SN-38 and CPT were dispersed in ultrapure water by bath
sonication. The amount of dispersed fCNTs was carefully estimated
by subtracting the weight of the undispersed fCNT residue after centrifugation
from the starting amount of fCNTs. Similar to the fCNTs without drugs,
the amount of SN-38- and CPT-encapsulated fCNTs dispersed in water
increased with increasing sonication time and reached a maximum of
0.31 mg/mL SN-38@fCNTs and 0.28 mg/mL CPT@fCNTs after 1 h of sonication
(Figure 1C). SN-38@fCNTs
and CPT@fCNTs showed less than 10% deviation in the total amount dispersed
compared to the fCNTs without the drugs. To determine the stability
of the encapsulated SN-38 and CPT in an aqueous environment, the amount
of SN-38 and CPT released from the fCNTs was measured by stirring
against Dulbecco’s phosphate buffered saline (DPBS) in a dialysis
tube. The data suggest that 1.10 and 1.45% of the total encapsulated
SN-38 and CPT, respectively, were released from the fCNTs into DPBS
over a 24 h period (Figure 1D).

Characterization of Drug@fCNTs
To confirm the successful
encapsulation of topoisomerase I inhibitors in fCNTs, fCNTs incubated
with SN-38 and CPT were characterized with Raman spectroscopy, transmission
electron microscopy (TEM), and photoluminescence spectroscopy. Compared
to fCNT soot and fCNTs incubated with free DMSO, SN-38@fCNTs and CPT@fCNTs
showed an increased peak intensity of the radial breathing mode (RBM),
G mode, and G′ mode with respect to the peak intensity of the
D mode (Figure 2A).
The peak position shifts of RBM, G–, and G+ as well as the two-dimensional (2D) band were also observed after
drug encapsulation. Longer incubation (120 h) of the fCNTs with CPT
further increases the peak intensity compared to a shorter incubation
time (12 h, Figure 2B). In addition, the encapsulation of CPT in fCNTs induces a further
shift of the G and 2D peak positions and the IG/ID and I2D/ID ratio (Figure 2C). Elemental analysis with energy-dispersive
spectroscopy (EDS) showed a higher presence of oxygen and nitrogen
in SN-38@fCNTs and CPT@fCNTs than in fCNT soot (Figure 2D). Photoluminescence data suggest that the
encapsulation of CPT in fCNTs decreased the peak intensity compared
to the bare fCNTs (Figure S1).

Drug@fCNTs Delivery to
Cancer Cells
To validate fCNTs
as a promising drug carrier, we investigated the anticancer efficacy
of SN-38 and CPT encapsulated in fCNTs against human cancer cells.
SN-38@fCNTs and CPT@fCNTs were effective in inhibiting PC-3 and LNCaP
cell growth compared to equivalent amounts of SN-38 and CPT in water
or DMSO (Figure 3A,E).
CPT@fCNTs dispersed in water showed comparable inhibition of cancer
cell proliferation with CPT solubilized in DMSO (Figure 3B,F). The drug@fCNTs-dependent
PC-3 and LNCaP cell growth inhibition data suggest that the anticancer
effects of SN-38@fCNTs and CPT@fCNTs are equivalent to those of the
same amounts of SN-38 and CPT in DMSO (Figure S2). Western blotting of lysed cells incubated with SN-38@fCNTs
and CPT@fCNTs revealed an increase in apoptotic markers (Bax, CC-3,
CC-9, and p53), whereas cells incubated with bare fCNTs dispersed
in water and CPT dispersed in water showed minimal change (Figure 3C,G). Cell morphology
changes were also observed, as LNCaP and PC-3 cells incubated with
CPT@fCNTs showed disintegrated cell membranes and eventual cell death
(Figure 3D,H, respectively).
The TEM images of PC-3 cells incubated with CPT@fCNTs also showed
cell membrane disintegration compared to PC-3 cells without drug treatment
(Figure S3).

Drug Distribution in Cancer Cells after Drug@fCNTs Delivery
To determine the destination of fCNT-encapsulated drugs inside
cells, the distribution of SN-38 and CPT inside the cells was monitored.
Briefly, LNCaP and PC-3 cells incubated with SN-38@fCNTs and CPT@fCNTs
were lysed, and the drug distribution in each cellular fraction was
analyzed using a cell fractionation kit. The majority of SN-38 after
incubation with SN-38@fCNTs was found in the cytoskeletal fraction,
followed by the plasma, mitochondria, and ER/Golgi membrane (Figure 4A), whereas CPT was
distributed mostly in the membrane, followed by the cytoskeletal and
soluble nuclear fractions (Figure 4C). Changes in the distribution profile of SN-38 and
CPT during a 24 h incubation period showed that the peak concentration
of SN-38 in the cytoskeletal fraction at 10 h gradually decreased,
whereas CPT showed a gradual increase in membrane distribution over
the 24 h monitoring period (Figure 4B,D). SN-38 in the other cellular fragments also showed
a peak at approximately 10 h with a stable or gradual decrease in
concentration during the next 14 h. In contrast, the CPT distribution
in the cytoskeletal and cytoplasmic fractions showed a gradual decrease,
whereas the distribution in the nucleic fraction remained relatively
constant over the 24 h monitoring period.

Discussion
Based on careful studies on the endohedral
filling of carbon nanotubes,17−19 anticancer drug encapsulation
in and delivery from fCNTs were studied.
SN-38 and CPT were selected as candidates for fCNT encapsulation,
as both of them are potent topoisomerase I inhibitors (the reported
IC50 of SN-38 is 120 nM in an HT29-based cell assay, and
the reported IC50 of CPT is 250 nM in an MDA-MB-231-based
cell assay; Table S1);4,28 however,
delivery is an issue, as both drugs are insoluble in water. As the
inner cavity of CNTs is hydrophobic, the inner space of CNTs can provide
a suitable environment for hydrophobic drugs. The fCNTs were selected
as an encapsulating carrier for SN-38 and CPT. They have shown low
cellular toxicity with fast clearance and can be dispersed in aqueous
media without surfactants or dispersants.30,31 The encapsulation of SN-38 and CPT in fCNTs was achieved by a simple
incubation method reported by another group;17−19 however, very
gentle stirring was applied, as intensive stirring induces the dispersion
of fCNTs in DMSO. A 120 h incubation in the presence of SN-38 and
CPT resulted in topoisomerase I inhibitor-encapsulated fCNTs, as confirmed
by various techniques (Figure 2). Although the log P of SN-38 is
similar or slightly higher than that of CPT, the amount of CPT encapsulated
in fCNTs (100.91 μg) is higher than that of SN-38 (48.82 μg)
under identical conditions. Campo et al. conduct careful studies on
CNT endohedral filling with more than 20 different molecules.17 Cis and cis/trans mixture of decalin showed
different absorbance for reasons include in packing efficiencies.17 This suggests that small changes in molecular
structure can influence the CNT endohedral filling efficiencies. Difference
in encapsulation efficiency is likely due to extra ethyl and hydroxyl
group on SN-38 despite only ∼12.6% (392.4 vs 348.4, Table S1) difference in the molecular weight.
Decrease in photoluminescence intensity after encapsulation was observed,
and we speculate that irregularity in encapsulation may reduce fCNT
properties (Figure S1). After encapsulation,
the degree of SN-38@fCNTs and CPT@fCNTs dispersion in aqueous media
was examined. Compared to bare fCNTs, SN-38-encapsulated fCNTs and
CPT-encapsulated fCNTs showed only a minor decrease in dispersion
(1 and 9% decrease, respectively), suggesting that neither SN-38 nor
CPT encapsulation induces significant modification of the carboxylic
functional groups on the surface of the fCNTs. Next, the stability
of the fCNT-encapsulated drugs in aqueous media was examined. To serve
as a drug carrier, the fCNTs should retain the encapsulated drug in
an aqueous environment until they reach their targets. By monitoring
the amount of drug released during a 24 h incubation period, we observed
that only a fraction of the encapsulated SN-38 and CPT was released
from the fCNTs (1.01 and 1.28%, respectively); therefore, fCNTs can
serve as a water-compatible carrier for hydrophobic drugs. After the
encapsulation process, the drug-encapsulating fCNTs were characterized
by Raman spectroscopy and TEM. Figure 2A shows that the peak intensity of the RBM, G, and
2D peaks significantly increased after the fCNTs were incubated with
free DMSO and further increased after they were incubated with SN-38
and CPT, whereas the intensity of the D mode remained almost the same.
We assumed that the enhanced IRBM/ID, IG/ID, and I2D/ID ratios after the encapsulation process were due to the
destroyed amorphous carbon included in the fCNTs, thereby diminishing
the shielding effect in the Raman spectra.32 In addition to the peak intensity change, the peak positions of
the RBM, G–, and G+ bands shifted after
the encapsulation process. Specifically, the peak shift of the G mode
was from ∼1598.99 to 1595.50 cm–1 and that
of the RBM mode was from 167.32 to 170.55 cm–1 with
drug encapsulation. Such effects may be attributed to the charge fluctuations
and structural lattice deformations of the fCNTs caused by external
molecules.33,34 Also, the peak shifts of RBM
and G bands were observed with DMSO treatment; and this can be due
to doping effect from amorphous carbon residues were removed by DMSO
or changing in the electronic states of fCNTs. We also cannot
completely rule out the effects of residual DMSO encapsulated in fCNTs.
We further acquired the Raman spectra of CPT@fCNT samples with increasing
encapsulation time (Figure 2B) and plotted the IG/ID and G peak position and I2D/ID and 2D peak position
against each other with 121 spectra for each sample (Figure 2C). As the incubation time
increased, a gradual increase in the IG/ID and I2D/ID ratios and a gradual decrease in
the G and 2D peak positions were found, indicating a possible encapsulation
of the drug molecules in fCNTs with increase in the incubation time.
The elemental analysis with EDS also suggests the successful encapsulation
of SN-38 and CPT in the fCNTs. Compared to that of the bare fCNTs,
the surfaces of the SN-38- and CPT-encapsulated fCNTs showed significant
concentrations of carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and oxygen (O) atoms.
As the amount of CPT encapsulated inside the fCNTs is higher than
the amount of SN-38 encapsulated, more N and O atoms were detected
on CPT@fCNTs than on SN-38@fCNTs despite SN-38 featuring an additional
O atom (SN-38 and CPT carry the same number of N atoms). After confirming
the successful encapsulation and dispersion of drug@fCNTs in aqueous
media, we examined the anticancer activity of drug@fCNTs. The LNCaP
and PC-3 cell lines were selected as therapeutic target cells, as
topoisomerase I inhibitors showed promising anticancer efficacy against
colon and small lung cancer, yet their potency against prostate cancer
is not confirmed.35 Compared to equivalent
amounts of SN-38/CPT nonhomogeneously dispersed in water, SN-38@fCNTs
and CPT@fCNTs showed >90% more inhibition of cancer cell proliferation.
Bare fCNTs dispersed in water induce 7.89 and 7.93% decrease in LNCaP
and PC-3 cell viability, respectively, suggesting that the anticancer
efficacy of drug@fCNTs is mostly from the encapsulated drugs released
and not from the fCNTs. SN-38@fCNTs and CPT@fCNTs showed similar cancer
cell proliferation inhibition profiles with SN-38/CPT solubilized
in DMSO; however, they have an advantage over DMSO-solubilized drugs:
drug-carrying fCNTs have better compatibility with aqueous media.
Apoptosis induced by drug@fCNTs was confirmed by Western blotting
of lysed cancer cells incubated with SN-38@fCNTs and CPT@fCNTs. Increased
expression levels of the apoptotic markers Bax, CC-3, CC-9, and p53
were observed in PC-3 and LNCaP cells incubated with SN-38@fCNTs and
CPT@fCNTs, whereas cells incubated with bare fCNTs or CPT dispersed
in water showed minimal expression levels. Two main CNT cell entry
mechanisms were proposed by previous studies: endocytosis and direct
penetration.36,37 Although some drug@fCNT may enter
cells via direct penetration, endocytosis blocking experiment at 4
°C suggests that endocytosis is drug@fCNT’s main cellular
entry mechanism (Figure S4). After confirming
the efficacy of drug@fCNTs, the distribution of SN-38 and CPT after
drug@fCNTs cell entry was examined. Interestingly, SN-38 and CPT showed
markedly different distributions, as the concentration of SN-38 in
the cytoskeletal fraction of cells increased over 10 h and remained
high, whereas CPT showed a gradual increase in concentration in the
plasma, mitochondria, and endoplasmic reticulum/Golgi membranes. SN-38
and CPT showed similar distribution profiles in PC-3 and LNCaP cells,
suggesting that the distribution in each cellular fraction is more
dependent on the type of drug. The structural difference between SN-38
and CPT may play a major role, but the detailed mechanism underlying
this difference in the distribution remains unclear and is a subject
for further research. In conclusion, the encapsulation of the hydrophobic
topoisomerase I inhibitors SN-38 and CPT in the fCNTs is successfully
demonstrated. With 4.88 (SN-38) and 10.09 (CPT) % encapsulation efficiencies,
drug@fCNTs can be successfully dispersed without losing a significant
amount of the drugs in aqueous media. Our result suggests that SN-38
and CPT encapsulated in fCNTs can be successfully delivered to and
released in cancer cells and can exert their anticancer effect while
maintaining their water compatibility inside the fCNT shell during
delivery.

Topoisomerase I Inhibitor
Encapsulation in fCNTs
Encapsulation
of topoisomerase I inhibitor was achieved by simple incubation with
mild agitation described previously.17−19 More specifically, 1
mg of SN-38 and CPT was solubilized in 1 mL of dimethyl sulfoxide
(DMSO, ACS grade > 99.9%) and incubated with 1 mg of fCNTs in capped
flat-bottom test tubes with a magnetic stir bar. The samples were
gently stirred in the dark for 5 days at room temperature unless described
otherwise. After stirring, the samples were centrifuged at 15 000
rpm for 1 h, and the unencapsulated (free) SN-38/CPT-containing supernatant
was collected. The residue was intensively washed, followed by centrifugation
at 15 000 rpm for 1 h. The supernatant was collected for analysis,
and the washing step was repeated twice. After the final washing step,
the samples were dried to yield SN-38@fCNTs and CPT@fCNTs.

Characterization
of Topoisomerase I Inhibitor-Encapsulated fCNTs
Raman spectroscopy
was conducted using an Invia Raman spectrometer
equipped with a 514 nm laser (Renishaw, Gloucestershire, U.K.). Transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) images of fCNTs and PC-3 cell images after
CPT@fCNTs delivery were obtained by an FEI Themis TEM (Hillsboro,
OR). Near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence spectra were obtained through
a HORIBA Jobin Yvon Nanolog NIR spectrophotometer (Kyoto, Japan) equipped
with a 450 W xenon arc lamp and a liquid nitrogen-cooled InGaAs detector.
The excitation wavelengths ranged from 400 to 800 nm with 2 nm increments,
and the emission wavelengths ranged from 850 to 1600 nm with 1.5 nm
increments. The fluorescence intensities were recorded with 20 s of
integration per scan and slit widths for the excitation and emission
of 14 nm and 40 nm, respectively.

Dispersion of Topoisomerase
I Inhibitor@fCNTs and Release of
SN-38/CPT in Aqueous Media
One milliliter of molecular biology
grade ultrapure water was added to 1 mg of SN-38/CPT-encapsulated
fCNTs and sonicated for 1 h in water bath (50 W) with ice to prevent
overheating. After sonication, the samples were centrifuged at 15 000
rpm for 1 h. Dispersed drug@fCNTs were collected, and undispersed
CNT residues were carefully collected for weight measurement. To test
the release of the encapsulated SN-38/CPT in aqueous media, 3 mL of
dispersed drug@fCNTs in water was loaded in a dialysis tube and stirred
in the presence of 20 mL of DPBS. After 0.5, 1, 4, 12, and 24 h, DBPS
was collected, and the concentrations of SN-38 and CPT released in
DPBS were analyzed with an liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry
(LC–MS/MS) consisting of an Agilent 1200 series HPLC system
(Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) equipped with an API 4000
QTRAP hybrid triple quadrupole/linear ion trap mass spectrometer (AB
Sciex Pte Ltd., Foster City, CA).

Cell Culture and Topoisomerase
I Inhibitor Delivery
The prostate cancer cell line PC-3 and
the LNCaP cell line were cultured
in RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin-streptomycin
at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator. For a stable delivery,
2 × 105 PC-3/LNCaP cells were cultured on a 24-well
plate and preincubated for 24 h. Then, 100 μL of SN-38@fCNTs
(∼1.5 μg of SN-38) and CPT@fCNTs (∼2.5 μg
of CPT) were mixed with 400 μL of RPMI-1640 medium and incubated
with cells for designated times. Equivalent amounts of SN-38 and CPT
solubilized in DMSO/dispersed in water were mixed with RPMI-1640 and
added to the cells. The cells were carefully washed with DPBS, and
the cell proliferation was analyzed with a CCK-8 and a microplate
reader (Molecular Devices SpectraMax i3, Sunnyvale, CA) according
to the manufacturer’s instructions. Bax, CC-3, and CC-8 antibodies
were used to monitor the apoptotic effect of SN-38 and CPT with Western
blotting. For the drug@fCNTs dose-dependent cell proliferation inhibition
assay, 10, 20, 50, 100, and 200 μL of SN-38@fCNTs/CPT@fCNTs
and an equivalent amount of SN-38/CPT in water or DMSO were mixed
with RPMI-1640 to a final volume of 500 μL and incubated with
LNCaP/PC-3 cells as described above. The cell images were obtained
using an Olympus IX 73 inverted microscope (Tokyo, Japan) and an FEI
Themis TEM.

Distribution of SN-38 and CPT in Cells after
Delivery
PC-3 and LNCaP cells at a density of 2 × 106 were
preincubated in 60 × 15 mm cell culture dishes for 48 h. After
a careful wash with DPBS, the cells were incubated with 1 mL of SN-38@fCNTs
and CPT@fCNTs mixed with 4 mL of RPMI-1640 medium. After 5, 10, and
24 h of incubation, the medium was removed and carefully washed twice
with DPBS. SN-38 and CPT subcellular fractions were obtained using
a subcellular protein fractionation kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific).
The concentrations of SN-38 and CPT in the fractions were measured
by an LC–MS/MS system.
