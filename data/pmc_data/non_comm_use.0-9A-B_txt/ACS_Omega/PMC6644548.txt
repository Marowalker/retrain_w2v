Amorphous
carbon nanotubes (a-CNTs) have been synthesized by a
simple low-temperature process and have been grafted with chemically
synthesized nickel oxide microflowers with different concentrations.
The phase and morphology of the as-prepared pure and hybrid samples
were characterized by X-ray diffraction and field emission scanning
and transmission electron microscopes. Thermal properties of the samples
were estimated by using thermal gravimetric and differential thermal
analysis. The optical properties of the sample were characterized
by UV–vis spectroscopic, Raman spectroscopic, and Fourier-transformed
infrared spectroscopic analysis. The electrochemical performance of
all hybrid samples has been done in detail for different scan rates
as well as from charge–discharge analysis. It has been seen
that because of the nickel oxide grafting, the electrochemical performance
of pure a-CNTs gets enhanced significantly. The value of the specific
capacitance of the hybrid comes out to be around 120 F/g for the best
sample, which is almost 12 times higher compared to that of the pure
a-CNTs. The result has been explained in terms of change in effective
surface area as well as change in conductivity of the hybrid samples.

1 Introduction
The exploration of defects into various applications nowadays becomes
an important challenge as well as a great opportunity in the field
of nanoscience and technology. On the basis of this idea, the concept
of amorphous carbon nanotubes (a-CNTs) becomes fascinating after the
crystalline counterpart of the materials being discovered in the year
of 1991 by Iijima.1,2 Apart from the scientific interest,
the concept of a-CNT is interesting in regard to the cost effectiveness,
simplicity, as well as high yield of the material; thus, it can be
an important part of nanotechnology as well.

It is an established
fact that CNT is an excellent material that
can be used in various applications, including mechanical, electrical,
electronic, medical, coating, and many others.3−6 Moreover, in all of these fields,
systematic efforts are being made to improve the property of the pure
CNT by hybridizing
it with different materials, like metal, semiconductor, as well as
polymers.7−9 These established facts propelled the researchers
to explore the amorphous analogue of CNTs in all of these fields and
optimize the performance by suitable functionalization or hybridization.10 Few of our previous works report several such
applications of a-CNTs and related hybrids in different fields.11−13

A very important application of carbon nanomaterial is that
it
can be used as a supercapacitor, thus helping in the concept of developing
alternative energy sources.14 The application
is rather important nowadays due to the crisis of conventional fossil
fuel energy, and it is thus very important to focus on the development
of renewable and sustainable energy.15 This
need propels the current researchers to focus into the field of electrochemical
capacitors as the promising candidate regarding energy sources. This
interest exists because of several facts, like long life stability,
high specific capacitance, high energy, and power density. For further
classification of the electrochemical capacitor, it should be noted
that electrical double layer capacitor (EDLC) stores charges on the
basis of the electrostatic charge storage mechanism whereas supercapacitors
are governed by chemical redox reactions. Generally, the transition
materials serve as good supercapacitor materials whereas carbon materials
with their high surface area are considered to be a good EDLC material.

There are reports of supercapacitive behavior of CNT or graphene
and related hybrids with different metal oxides as well as polymers.
For example, Ma et al. reported a very high capacitance value for
nickel cobalt hydroxide and reduced graphene oxide hybrid nanolayers
for high-performance asymmetric supercapacitors with remarkable cycling
stability.16 Mondal et al. also reported
the high-capacitance values for multiwall carbon nanotube–nickel
cobalt oxide hybrid structure as high-performance electrodes for supercapacitors
and lithium-ion batteries.17 Dai et al.
reported that cobalt sulfide/carbon nanotube hybrid can be an excellent
candidate for storing energy electrochemically.18 Gu et al. reported high-performance all-solid-state asymmetric
stretchable supercapacitors based on wrinkled MnO2/CNT
and Fe2O3/CNT macrofilms.19

However, all of these reports involve crystalline
phase of CNTs
and so far the authors are concerned there are no reports regarding
the supercapacitor behavior of a-CNTs and related hybrids except few
of authors own works published previously,20−22 where a-CNT–copper,
a-CNT–manganese oxide, or a-CNT–MnO2–pyrrole
hybrid system shows good capacitive property.

As mentioned before,
although there are reports of better electrochemical
performance of CNT–NiO hybrids, all of these systems are associated
with the crystalline CNTs that are costly, hard to develop, and yield
is less, which makes them not very suitable for real industry-scale
application. Especially, although there are reports of large-scale
production of crystalline CNTs that satisfy industry needs, the associated
making cost and complexity of the procedure do not encourage the technologists
much to proceed further.23−26 For instance, Wang et al. reported the large-scale
production of CNT via chemical vapor deposition at much elevated temperatures,
as high as 700 °C, with external catalyst.23 Pirard and co-worker followed the same method with additional
use of continuous inclined mobile-bed rotating reactor.24 Logeswari et al. reported an efficient catalyst
for large-scale production of CNTs, but there also the process needed
temperature as high as 800 °C.25 Kim
et al. reported the large-scale production of CNTs by evaporating
carbon black with introduction of thermal plasma,26 and thus again cost optimization is not satisfactory. Moreover,
in all of these cases, being inert for crystalline CNTs’ external
acid treatment is necessary, which adds even more cost to system development.
However, our system uses a-CNTs, which are cost effective and easy
to synthesize with very high yield, thus having the potential for
industrial scale use.

Keeping this in mind, here, nickel oxide
nanostructure has been
chosen for hybridization. It is noteworthy that nickel oxide is another
transition-metal oxide that already has established itself as a potential
candidate for being used as energy storage material. There are reports
of nickel oxide being anchored onto the walls of CNTs and the composites
being used as supercapacitor materials, as mentioned before, but the
literature remained completely silent regarding the supercapacitive
performance of a-CNT–NiO composites.

Thus, here, we have
reported for the first time the synthesis of
the NiO microflower-decorated a-CNTs and also studied the electrochemical
performance of the hybrids in detail.

It should also be noted
that this is the first report regarding
the electrochemical performance a-CNT–NiO hybrids and thus
there is plenty of scope to optimize the performance of the system.
In this way, the present work has significant importance in view of
the modern energy storage technology.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 X-ray Diffraction (XRD)
Analysis
Figure 1 shows the
XRD pattern of all pure and hybrid samples within the range of 2θ
= 20–70 °C with normal θ–2θ scanning.
One can see that there are several distinct peaks for the hybrid samples
centering around 36, 42, and 62° that are characteristics of
(111), (200), and (220) planes of cubic NiO, respectively.

Figure 1 XRD spectra
of all pure and hybrid samples.

Also, it can be seen that for the pure a-CNTs, there are
two broad
humps at 26 and 42°. These two are characteristics of (002) and
(110) planes of hexagonal graphite phase. It is worth mentioning that
unlike the crystalline phase of CNTs, there exist only broad humps
at the particular position mentioned, before which are the characteristics
of the amorphous CNT where only a short-range ordered periodicity
exists. Also, because the synthesis process yields of a-CNTs as well as NiO are not very high, all samples have
the poor crystallinity.

It should also be noted that because
of the thick coating, hybrid
samples show no signs of carbon-related peak at 2θ = 26°.
For the other peak at 42°, it can be seen that the position of
carbon- and NiO-related peak is almost the same.

2.2 Microscopic Study
Figure 2a–f shows the field
emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) images of all a-CNTs
and hybrid samples S1 and S2 with different magnifications. It is
seen that a-CNTs with one-dimensional tubular structure with a diameter
of around 120 nm and length of few micrometers have been formed. The
structure has been formed uniformly over a large area. It is also
seen that the walls of the as-synthesized a-CNTs are rather rough
and they are in bundle form,
which is mainly due to the strong intertube van der Waal interaction.

Figure 2 FESEM
images of (a, b) pure a-CNTs, (c, d) sample S1, and (e, f)
sample S2 with different magnifications.

In micrographs of both the hybrid samples, one can see the
flowerlike
NiO structures with dimensions of around 1 μm and the thickness
of the individual petal is no more than 10–20 nm. The length
and breadth of the petals are around 150 nm each. It is to be noted that the density of the flowers is much
higher in the case of sample S2 compared to that of S1. This is because
of the fact that the amount of Ni precursor is higher for the synthesis
of S2.

From the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image
(Figure 3a,b), the
flakelike
nanostructure can clearly be seen; however, the entire flowerlike
structures were broken mainly due to ultrasonication as well as due
to collision with high-energy electron beam during recording. The
flakes can be seen in a wrinkled form and the dimension of individual
flakes is around 200 nm, thus supporting the FESEM information.

area (electron) diffraction pattern of the same.

2.3 Optical Study
Figure 4 shows the Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy
(FTIR) spectra of both S1 and S2 with those of pure a-CNTs shown in
the inset. It is seen that both S1 and S2 have peaks centering around
590 and 1625 cm–1. Apart from this, there are three
bands between 990–1208, 2835–2985, and 3200–3690
cm–1, of which the middle band is the signature
C–Hn27 band and the band between 3200–3690 cm–1 is associated with O–H bond.27 The peak at 1625 cm–1 is the signature of C=C
bond.28 The peak at 590 cm–1, which is absent in the FTIR spectra of a-CNTs, may be due to Ni–O
stretching vibration.29 The broad band
between 990–1208 cm–1, which is also absent
in the FTIR spectra of a-CNTs, is due to overlapping of different
bonds like C=C, C–C stretching, and C–N stretching.30 The FTIR spectrum is kind of an indirect proof
of a-CNTs being covered with NiO.

Figure 4 FTIR spectra of S1 and S2 samples and
inset same for pure a-CNTs.

The Raman spectra of both the hybrid samples has been shown
in Figure 5, with that
of pure
a-CNTs shown in the inset. It is seen that for pure a-CNTs, there
are two sharp peaks at 1368 and 1574 cm–1. These
two are the very well-known D and G bands of carbon, as reported in
our previous work, with all other calculated parameters.31

Figure 5 Raman spectra of S1 and S2 samples and inset same for
pure a-CNTs.

The hybrid samples due
to dense coating of NiO show no such signature,
instead two new peaks can be seen around 562 and 1080 cm–1. These two peaks are the signature of 1 photon LO and 2 photon 2LO
mode of the nickel oxide. However, it is rather surprising that although
the relative percentage of Ni precursors is higher in sample S2, the
intensity of the NiO-related peak is higher in sample S1.32

The transmittance and absorbance spectra
of both the samples S1
and S2 have been shown in Figure 6a,b, with the corresponding Tauc plot shown in the
inset of Figure 6a.
Before recording the spectra, certain amounts of both the samples
were dispersed into ethanol and the dispersion was taken for measurement
where the pure ethanol was used as background. It is seen that there
are marked differences in spectra of both samples; sample S2 has much
higher transmittance compared to that of sample S1, whereas in the
absorbance spectra, the trend is reversed, as expected. Also, another
marked difference is that for S2, the falling of transmittance is
rather sharp compared to that for S1. This is because of the fact
that our NiO is crystalline unlike a-CNTs and in S2, the quantity
of NiO is rather higher; thus, this sharp fall of transmittance is
expected.

Figure 6 Transmission (a) and absorption (b) spectra of hybrid samples,
inset in (a) shows the corresponding Tauc plot for the determination
of band gap.

The optical band gap
of both the samples is calculated using the
normal Tauc plot where the intercept of tangent to (αhν)2 versus the hν
plot with x axis gives the value of optical gap.
It is seen that the value of optical gap has increased slightly from
2.51 to 2.75 eV for sample S2.

2.4 Thermal
Study
Figure 7a,b shows the thermal gravimetric analysis
(TGA) and differential thermal analysis (DTA) curve for all three
samples, respectively. It is clearly seen that the hybrid sample is
much more thermally stable compared with the pure a-CNTs and the stability
of the samples increases by increasing the Ni precursor percentage.

Figure 7 TGA (a)
and DTA (b) curves of pure a-CNTs and hybrid samples.

Pure a-CNTs show an initial mass loss until 100
°C, which
is associated with the evaporation, and then show a steady decrease
and at a temperature of 800 °C only 20% of the initial value.

For the hybrid sample, apart from the initial mass loss due to
water evaporation, the main weight loss takes place within the temperature
range 350–650 °C. At the initial temperature of 350 °C,
both the samples have 87% of the initial weight at 650 °C; the
S1 sample is degraded to 54% of its initial weight, whereas for S2,
the corresponding value is 67% only. The loss is mainly due to desorption
of excess oxygen.

From the DTA curves, it is seen that all three
samples show an
endothermic peak at 50 °C and a broad exothermic peak at 227
°C. The first peak may be associated with the water evaporation,
whereas the second one can corresponds to the oxygen desorption. Another
broad endothermic peak can be seen around 640 °C but only for
S2; for the other two samples, this peak is supposed to be seen at
a temperature beyond 800 °C. The small dissimilarities in the
DTA characteristics of pure a-CNT, S1, and S2 are not very surprising
since sample S2 has much higher oxide content compared to that of
S1 and for pure a-CNTs, it is 0. This effect has been manifested in
the DTA characteristics.

2.5 Electrochemical Study
The cyclic
voltammetric (C–V) curves
for the two hybrid samples have been shown in Figure 8a,b, whereas the same for pure a-CNTs and
all related results are shown in our previous work.21 The specific capacitance (Csp) of the hybrids was calculated from the C–V curves using the relation21 1  where Csp is the
specific capacitance (F/g), I is the current (A), m is the mass of the electrode active material (g), y is the scan rate (V/s) of C–V curves, and (Va – Vc) is the potential window (V) for different
scan rates.

Figure 8 C–V characteristics of
(a) sample S1 and (b) sample S2 with different scan rates.

Figure 9 shows the
variation of Csp with scan rate for both
the samples, and it has been shown that the value decreases with increasing
scan rates and the value of capacitance reaches around 120 F/g for
sample S2 at the lowest scan rate, almost double that of S1. The enhancement
is almost 2 orders compared with pure a-CNTs reported in our previous
work21 that had a value of around 9 F/g
only.

Figure 9 Variation of specific capacitance value obtained from C–V characteristics with scan rates for both
the hybrid samples.

The variation of specific
capacitance with the scan rate is rather
common, as reported by other workers, and has been explained in terms
of speed of the ion movement, mainly insertion and release of Na+ ion into and from
electrode materials and entry into electrolyte solution.33

The material used here is porous in nature,
and thus movement of
the ions within the pores would facilitate the electrochemical performance
of the material. At a low scan rate, the ions have enough time to
reach all of the interior part of the electrodes and thus the amount
of charge accumulation is higher, giving a high value of specific
capacitance. On the other hand, when the scan rate is high, the cycle
change takes place too quickly so that the ions do not have enough
time to access the interior part of the porous material and can reach
the outer part of the electrodes in general, resulting in a low value
of capacitance.34

Figure 10a,b shows
the typical galvanostatic charge and discharge (C–D) curve of both the hybrid samples for
three different current densities, with corresponding variations of
specific capacitance shown in Figure 11.

Figure 10 Charging–discharging characteristics of (a) sample
S1 and
(b) sample S2 with different current densities.

Figure 11 Variation of the specific capacitance value obtained from charge–discharge
characteristics with current density for both hybrid samples.

The specific capacitance from C–D curves was calculated using
the relation 2  where I is the discharge
current (A), ΔE is the potential window (V), t is the discharge time (s), and m is the
mass of the active material (g).

It is seen that again, the
capacitance value of the hybrid sample
S2 is much higher compared to that of S1, as well as that of pure
a-CNTs.

It is worth mentioning that the C–D curves of sample S2 unlike S1 show a flat plateau region
for all current densities. The reason for the appearance of such regions
is yet to be discovered. However there are a large number of reports
that show such regions including the author’s own previous
work.21

The rate capability (R) of both samples has been
calculated from the charging–discharging data using the relation 3  and it has come out to be 35 and 105% for
the samples S1 and S2, respectively. Thus, it is seen that with the
increase of NiO content, the performance of the sample remains almost
the same for different current densities, suggesting favorable use
of the hybrids in electrochemical applications.

Other two very
important parameters that are related to the electrochemical
performance of any material are the energy density (E) and power density (P) obtained from the following
relations 4  and 5  where V is the potential
window (V) and t the discharge time (s). The associated
parameters calculated from the above formula for both samples and
for all current densities are summarized in Table 1, which shows that the hybrid may be used
as an efficient electrode material.

The Coulombic
efficiency of the sample S2 has been shown in Figure 12, which shows that
the efficiency drops down to 93% within few cycles; then, it remains
constant up to 10 000 cycles, showing that the material is
suitable for long-term operation.

Figure 12 Coulombic efficiency of the hybrid sample
S2 and inset showing
energy density of both the samples S1 and S2.

The Nyquist plots of both the hybrid samples are shown in Figure 13 with that of pure
a-CNTs shown from our previous work. The plot at the low-impedance
region has been shown separately in the inset. It is seen that when
the entire region is considered, the plot of S2 consists of three
semicircles with a much lower radius of curvature compared to that
of S1 that has two semicircles. The results indicate that a-CNTs as
well as sample S1 have large charge-transfer resistance (Rct), thus hindering transport of charge. On the contrary,
a small radius of curvature in the Nyquist plot of sample S2 indicates
high conducting nature.35,36

Figure 13 Nyquist plots of both
samples S1 and S2.

It should be noted that
the straight line nature of the imaginary
part of the impedance spectra of the Nyquist plot shows the ideal
capacitive behavior of the sample.

For NiO-coated a-CNTs, the
carbon part prevents the system from
degradation due to any mechanical perturbation and thus makes it suitable
for long-term stability. Thus, it acts as a structural buffer between
the electrodes and electrolytes.

Also, being the transition
metal, nickel shows variable valence
states and thus it becomes easier for the redox reaction to occur
between variable valance states, which helps the system to store energy.
The high dielectric constant of the attached NiO, the specific capacitance
from the C–V, as well as C–D curve, has been increased to a great extent.

Table 2 summarizes
the electrochemical performance of some carbon and related hybrid-based
electrode materials reported recently.16,20−22,37−51 It has been seen that this work reports so far the best percentage
of increase of capacitance value of the base material in its hybrid
form. Also, with respect to the absolute value of capacitance, the
material is comparable and sometimes even better compared with the
other reported results, with further advantages of an easy, cost effective,
and high-yield synthesis procedure.

It is to
be noted that other a-CNT-related hybrids show significant
enhancement after being hybridized with other oxides or polymer materials
of which a-CNT–MnO2–polymer composite shows
the highest enhancement, whereas a-CNTs–CuO shows the least.
a-CNT–MnO2 hybrid gives comparable results with
that of the present work, as expected. It is noteworthy that the research
related to amorphous carbon nanotubes has just been begun. Thus, the
material is now at a stage of being standardized for the best performance.
Efforts are being put in studying the capacitor characterization of
the material after being functionalized with other materials. Thus,
the best performance from this material is yet to be reported for
the best hybridization combination.

It is to be noted that the
betterment of electrochemical performance
of the a-CNT–NiO system takes place due to the proper attachment
of the NiO nanostructures on to the a-CNTs’ wall. The attachment
is possible without a-CNTs’ being functionalized externally
due to their rough wall as well as presence of large numbers of defects
of a-CNTs for their being amorphous. Thus, because of this, reported
hybrids of a-CNTs being not much active in capacitive behavior hold
the system intact for long cycle operation,
whereas the oxide part on the wall of a-CNT acted as a capacitive
material for obtaining high specific capacitance value and high energy
density.

3 Conclusions
A facile
synthesis route for developing a-CNT–NiO nanoflower
hybrid electrode has been reported. The microstructures of the as-prepared
hybrids were characterized by FESEM and TEM analysis, confirming the
successful attachment of NiO nanostructures onto a-CNTs. XRD confirms
the amorphousness of the a-CNTs as well as proper phase formation
for the NiO nanostructures. Raman as well as FTIR studies indicate
the different bonds present in the samples, whereas TGA analysis confirms
the thermal stability monotonically increases with increase in NiO
amount in the hybrids. As-developed hybrids show efficient electrochemical
performance with long-term stability. The specific capacitance obtained
from the C–V characteristics
has a value, as high as 120 F/g, comparable or better compared with
the other reported results, and also, it gives the highest percentage
of increment 1233% compared to that of pure a-CNTs. The hybrid thus
shows long cycle stability and high power density and Coulombic efficiency
and also reversible charge–discharge phenomena, thus being
suitable for use in highly efficient supercapacitor devices.

4 Experimental Section and Characterization
The synthesis
of a-CNTs has been reported in many of our previous
works.21 Briefly speaking, a certain amount
of ferrocene and a-CNTs were mixed in a 1:2 ratio and thoroughly mixed
in a mortar, followed by open atmosphere heating at 225 °C for
30 min. The mixture was then naturally cooled and thoroughly washed
with diluted HCl and deionized water. The mixture was then filtered,
and the residue was taken and dried in an oven overnight at 60 °C
to get the final product.

For preparation of NiO nanostructures,
following steps were followed:

The precursors used were, nickel
sulfate, potassium persulfate,
aqueous ammonia, and ultrapure deionized water. All materials were
purchased and used without further purification.

In a typical
experiment for two different samples, 0.75 g of potassium
per sulfate was added to 1 and 2 g of nickel sulfate separately taken
into a beaker filled with 200 mL of deionized water. The mixture was
then stirred rigorously to form homogeneous solution. The step was
followed by addition of 2.5 mL of aqueous ammonia (25–28%)
into the above solution and mixed in a magnetic stirrer for 1 h. The
mixture was then filtered, and the residue was dried at 220 °C
for 1.5 h. However, the final product was obtained only after annealing
it at 300 °C in air for 1.5 h.

Two samples were prepared
apart from the pure a-CNTs. In one sample,
0.075 g of a-CNTs were added during stirring with aqueous ammonia,
where 1 g of nickel sulfate was added (sample S1) and for the other,
2 g of nickel sulfate was used (sample S2).

The as-prepared
pure and hybrid samples were characterized by X-ray
diffraction (XRD, Bruker D8 ADVANCE), field emission scanning electron
microscopy (FESEM, JEOL 6340F FEG-SEM), high-resolution transmission
electron microscopy (HRTEM, JEOL-JEM 2100), a Fourier-transformed
infrared spectrometer (Shimadzu FTIR-8400S), a Raman spectrometer
(Witec, λexcitation = 532 nm), a UV–vis spectrophotometer
(JASCO V-750), and TG-DTA analysis (TG-DTA, PerkinElmer). The detailed
electrochemical characterization was done using a PHE200 Physical
Electrochemistry Software with a Gamry’s Potentiostat with
1 M Na2SO4 electrolyte solution at room temperature.
The amounts of working samples (S1 and S2) taken for electrode preparation
were 0.8 gm.

The sample preparation for the electrochemical
measurement was
as follows:

All measurements were done with a three-electrode
system, where
the reference electrode of Ag/AgCl and a counter electrode of platinum
were used. The working electrodes were developed by the same process
described in our previous work.22

The electrochemical performance was studied both from cyclic voltammetry
study as well as galvanostatic charging–discharging study.
Five different scan rates, like 10, 20, 50, 100, and 200 mV/s, were
employed within 0–1 V range to study the C–V characteristics. Electrochemical impedance
spectroscopy was operated between frequency ranges of 0.01–105 Hz at 0.5 V with an alternating current voltage amplitude
of 50 mV.
