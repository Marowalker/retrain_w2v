Boiling
is an efficient heat-transfer mechanism because of the
utilization of latent heat of vaporization and has the potential to
be used for cooling high-power electronic devices. Surface enhancement
is one of the widely used techniques for heat-transfer augmentation
in boiling systems. Here, an experimental investigation was conducted
on chemical vapor deposition-grown three-dimensional (3D) foamlike
graphene-coated silicon surfaces to investigate the effect of pore
structures on pool boiling heat transfer and corresponding heat-transfer
enhancement mechanisms. 3D graphene-coated samples with four graphene
thicknesses were utilized along with a plain surface to investigate
boiling heat-transfer characteristics and enhancement mechanisms.
A high-speed camera was used to provide a deeper understanding of
the bubble dynamics upon departure of emerging bubbles and visualize
vapor columns in different boiling regimes. On the basis of the obtained
results, in addition to interfacial evaporation, mechanical resonance
of the 3D structure had also a considerable effect on vapor column
formation. The results indicated that there is an optimum thickness,
which exhibits the best performance in terms of boiling heat transfer.

Introduction
Because of the recent
trend of miniaturization of electronic devices,
thermal management of such devices is obligatory and yet challenging.
There are many cooling methods such as spray cooling1,2 and passive cooling techniques3−5 involving phase change phenomena.
Among phase change (liquid–vapor) phenomena, boiling is a widely
used phenomenon in the industry.6 Owing
to a large amount of heat dissipation and achievable high heat-transfer
coefficients, it is one of the most effective heat-transfer mechanisms
for cooling high-power microelectronic devices.7−9 A typical boiling
phenomenon (shown in Figure 1) starts with single-phase natural convection. As the wall
heat flux increases, bubbles start to form. They grow and eventually
depart from the heated surface. The process of bubble formation and
departure is associated with partial nucleate boiling. The nucleation
process in partial nucleate boiling strongly depends on the surface
morphology. As the rate of bubble nucleation increases with the applied
heat flux, more bubbles coalesce, forming vapor columns. In the so-called
developed nucleate boiling region, heat transfer from the heated surface
is enhanced up to a point, where the formation of vapor columns and
blankets eventually reduces the heat transfer by acting as an isolating
layer between the heated surface and the liquid. This point is called
critical heat flux (CHF), which is the limit for systems involving
boiling phenomena. Beyond CHF, a permanent vapor blanket appears on
the heated surface, and the surface temperature dramatically increases,
leading to the device burnout.

Figure 1 Different regions of boiling.

Both heat-transfer coefficient and CHF are affected
by surface
properties such as surface roughness, wettability, and porosity. Accordingly,
pool boiling heat transfer has been enhanced using micro–nanostructures,10,11 coated particles,12,13 and nanowires.14,15

Graphene is a new material and has received much attention
because
of its unique properties and interesting capabilities. Graphene consisting
of sp2-hybridized carbon atoms in two-dimensional hexagonal
lattice16 has been a promising alternative
for many fields owing to its high thermal and electrical conductivity,
noteworthy optical transmittance, superior chemical stability, and
high flexibility.17−20 Although graphene has these unique properties, its preparation typically
results in cracks, wrinkling, defects, and mechanical problems when
integrated into three-dimensional (3D) applications.14,21−23 To overcome this drawback, graphene has been prepared
in 3D forms such as aerogels, foams, and sponges during the last decade.
These forms have low mass density, large surface area, good mechanical
stability, and high thermal and electrical conductivity. Besides energy,
sensing, detecting, tissue engineering, and environmental applications,20,24,25 3D graphene frameworks also have
a potential in heat-transfer enhancement because of their high thermal
conductivity and porosity.26−32

3D graphene foam has been prepared using two main approaches:
self-assembly
method and temple-assisted chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method.21,33−36 In the self-assembly method, reduced graphene oxide (rGO) is used
as a precursor and prepared by the oxidation of natural graphite powder
with the use of strong chemical oxidants such as HNO3,
KMNO4, and H2SO4. Because of the
ability of preparation in large quantities and abundant surface functional
groups, rGO has been extensively used as a precursor for producing
3D graphene and graphene-based composites.37−40 Although rGO has these advantages,
it is poorly conductive because of the surface defects and oxygen-containing
groups, which are introduced during the oxidation process of graphite.
The use of chemical oxidants also introduces some disadvantages such
as toxicity, corrosiveness, and the possibility of noncarbon impurities
in rGO. In addition, the hydrophobic rGO sheets are easy to aggregate
and restack because of the partial removal of hydrophilic functional
groups after the reduction of GO. Therefore, both of these shortcomings
limit the performance of 3D graphene structures.41−46

The CVD method has been considered as an alternative method
to
overcome these drawbacks. In this method, 3D graphene foams are produced
onto a porous metal substrate using a carbon precursor with hydrogen
at a high temperature under vacuum conditions. With this method, more
controlled and uniform morphologies and structures can be obtained.
In addition, obtained graphene foams exhibit a continuous and interconnected
graphene 3D network with each other without any breaks and copying
and inheriting the interconnected 3D scaffold structure of the porous
metal substrate templates. This structure provides desired properties
such as outstanding thermal conductivity and large specific surface
area (SSA),25,26,31,47−52 thereby making 3D graphene foams a strong alternative for high heat
flux cooling systems.

The effect of graphene coatings on boiling
heat transfer has been
investigated in a number of studies.53,54 Most of them
focused on the graphene layer coating and resulting deposition of
graphene suspensions on a heated surface. For example, Kim et al.55 investigated CHF enhancement in a graphene oxide
(GO) colloidal suspension. In their experiments, nucleate boiling
was performed on a surface coating, which formed as a resulting deposition
of GO colloids. It was reported that the thickness of the deposited
layer was approximately proportional to the observed increase in CHF.
Using the graphene/GO suspensions in water, Park et al.56 examined the effect of nanosheet deposition
on CHF. They concluded that the nanosheet porous structure formation
(because of its own self-assembly characteristic) resulted in critical
instability wavelength alteration, which eventually enhanced CHF.
3D foamlike rGO was used by Ahn et al.57,58 to prevent
heater failure during boiling. They showed that because of the excellent
thermal conductivity, the graphene-coated layer prohibited preparation
of hot spots, resulting in CHF enhancement.

Seo et al.59 examined pool boiling heat
transfer on nanoporous graphene-layered-deposited surfaces, which
were prepared by the rapid thermal annealing method. Enhancement in
CHF was explained by high porosity and permeability of graphene coating
and subsequent effects of these parameters on hydrodynamic and capillary
pumping limits. Jaikumar et al.60 investigated
the effect of graphene and GO coatings on pool boiling enhancement.
They transferred the mixture of graphene and GO to copper plain samples
by the dip coating method. They reported enhancements of 42 and 47%
for CHF and heat-transfer coefficient, respectively. They also showed
that the pool boiling performance was notably impeded by the increase
in coating thickness of graphene and the GO layer. Afterward, Jaikumar
et al.61 presented the combined effect
of GO and porous copper particles on pool boiling enhancement. Rapid
nucleation activity, high wettability as a result of roughness augmentation,
and wicking-enabled dendritic structures were mentioned as the contributing
mechanisms for CHF and HTC enhancements.

This study for the
first time presents pool boiling experiments
conducted on CVD-grown 3D foamlike graphene-coated surfaces and investigates
the effect of graphene thickness in a 3D structured network on the
pool boiling heat-transfer performance. The results were supported
by images, which were taken by using a high-speed camera. Bubble dynamics,
vapor columns, and heat-transfer mechanisms on graphene-coated surfaces
with different thicknesses are discussed in detail.

Results and Discussion
In this study, 3D graphene foams were grown on porous nickel foams
with a thickness of 1.6 mm and pore sizes ranging from 60 to 700 μm
(≥95% porosity, 99.99% purity, Alantum Advanced Technology
Materials (Dalian) Co. Ltd) by the CVD method in a horizontal furnace
system. The CVD growth procedure and conditions are presented in Supporting Information Note S1. To obtain graphene
foams without nickel scaffold, nickel foams were etched in 1 M FeCl3 solution for 24 h. After the nickel foams were completely
etched, graphene foams were cleaned with deionized water/HCl mixed
solutions until FeCl3 residues were completely gone. At
the last step, the samples were transferred onto the SiO2/Si substrate with 2 × 2 cm2 and then dried at 80
°C for 30 min in an oven to enable the adhesion of the graphene
foams on the substrate. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller surface
area measurement technique (Micromeritics ASAP 2020) was used to measure
the SSA of graphene foams. The samples were degassed using flowing
N2 at 200 °C for 24 h before the measurements. The
characterization of 3D graphene foams was performed by the X-ray diffraction
(XRD, Bruker AXS ADVANCE), Raman (Renishaw inVia Reflex), and scanning
electron microscopy (SEM, Zeiss Gemini 1530) techniques. The crystalline
structures of the samples were determined by XRD patterns, which were
obtained at ambient temperature over 2θ values within the range
of 20°–80° under Cu Kα X-ray radiation (λCu
= 1.5406 Å). The Raman spectra were collected in the wavelength
of 100–3200 cm–1 under 532 nm excitation
at 2 μm spot size to identify the graphene morphology. The scanning
electron microscope operated at 20 kV was used to observe the 3D structures
of graphene foams. Table 1 shows the graphene thicknesses for each sample.

The 3D networks are identified via the SEM) technique,
as shown
in Figure 2, for sample
#4. The SEM image of the interconnected 3D nickel foam structure with
a smooth surface is shown in Figure 2a. After CVD growth, graphene layers cover the nickel
foam surface (Figure 2b). Single-layer graphene flakes and multilayer graphene flakes are
represented as SLG and MLG on the SEM image, respectively. Figure 2c displays the SEM
images of graphene foams without a nickel foam template. It can be
seen from SEM images that graphene foams copied the interconnected
3D structure of nickel foam templates. Because the graphene foam is
extremely thin, wrinkles occur on the graphene surface during the
etching process. The pore size of the graphene foam was calculated
as between 70 and 400 μm, and the thickness of the branch width
was found to be about 70 μm. The detailed information about
sample characterization is presented in Supporting Information Note S2.

It is known that only cavities
within a specific size range can
be activated during the nucleation process. The size range depends
on several factors such as liquid superheat, implying that a sufficient
liquid superheat is required for bubble growth from a nucleus. Figure 3 presents the bubble
nucleation process from a single cavity and within porous medium.
As can be seen, bubble nucleation from surfaces with only discrete
cavities strongly depends on the individual cavity radius and its
surrounding fluid temperature, which causes different bubble departure
diameters on such surfaces (Figure 3a). For surfaces with porous coatings, as demonstrated
in Figure 3b, the cavities
are connected with a mesh structure. By providing interconnected paths
for liquid and vapor phases, the pore network increases the interaction
among nucleation sites and the surrounding fluid.

Figure 3 Bubble nucleation from
surfaces with (a) discrete cavity structure
and (b) pore network. The porous medium directly affects the nucleation
process by providing interconnected paths for vapor and liquid transport.

Pool boiling experiments were
conducted under atmospheric pressure
using deionized water as the working fluid. A detailed description
of the experimental setup, procedure, and uncertainty analysis is
presented in Supporting Information Note
S3. Heat-transfer mechanisms and forces acting on the individual bubbles
in the partial nucleate boiling region [wall superheat lower than
∼15 (K)] and vapor columns in the developed nucleate boiling
region [wall superheat higher than ∼15 (K)] are different from
each other. It should be noted that the difference between the wall
and saturation temperatures is defined as wall superheat (ΔTsup).

The onset of partial nucleate boiling
is identified with individual
bubbles growing and departing from the heated surface. According to
the obtained wall superheats shown in Figure 4a, at a fixed wall heat flux (up to ∼30
(kW/m2)), graphene coatings have a considerable effect
on the wall superheat (ΔTsup <
15 (K)). Because of high thermal conductivity of graphene coatings,
bubbles nucleate not only at the bottom of coating but also within
the porous medium. The heat-transfer coefficients are shown in Figure 4b. As expected, promising
heat-transfer enhancement can be observed for graphene coatings. The
heat-transfer enhancement at partial nucleate boiling (ΔTsup < 15 K) increases with graphene thickness
such that the maximum heat-transfer enhancement for coatings with
graphene thicknesses of 55, 29, 13, and 8 nm are ∼56, ∼33,
∼23, and ∼12%, respectively.

surfaces.

To have an understanding about
the bubble departure diameter at
partial nucleate boiling, a model was developed based on the bubble
growth force, buoyancy force, inertia forces, lift force, and surface
tension force.62Figure 5a shows the forces acting on a departed bubble
from a pore. The buoyancy and lift forces tend to detach the bubble
from the surface, while other forces keep it attached. The force balance
equation is obtained as 1  

Figure 5 Schematic and heat-transfer mechanisms in partial
boiling (ΔT < 15 K): (a) bubble nucleation
on graphene-coated porous
surface and forces acting on a bubble upon departure from a porous
surface, (b) bubble nucleation and growth inside the porous medium,
(c) experimental bubble departure diameters, and (d) experimental
bubble departure frequencies for surfaces with different coating thicknesses.

The expressions of the forces
acting on the bubble are used to
analyze the effect of graphene coating on the bubble upon the departure
point (Supporting Information Note S4).
The heat transfer from the superheated liquid into the bubble is considered
to be a transient conduction process (Figure 5b). Within the porous medium, heat transfer
from the superheat liquid is much more than the uncoated sample. Taking
into account that at a partial nucleate boiling region bubble nucleation
strongly depends on the liquid superheat, the 3D graphene foam acts
as a conductive network, providing the required liquid temperature
for the onset of the nucleation process. The time required for the
liquid to attain this superheat is called the waiting period. Heat
transfer from
the superheated liquid into the bubble is considered to be a transient
conduction process. The graphene network reduces the waiting period,
thereby offering enhanced conduction heat transfer within the porous
medium and consequently enhanced pool boiling heat transfer. This
accelerates the nucleation process and results in lower bubble growth
force, as shown in Figure 5a. Consequently, graphene coating reduces the bubble departure
diameter. Bubble departure diameter decreases simultaneously with
a decrease in departure frequency, which enhances cooling of the surface.

Furthermore, using visual images bubble departure diameter and
frequencies are measured in the experiments. A detailed procedure
for bubble departure diameter and frequency calculation is presented
in a previous study.63 The obtained bubble
departure diameters and frequencies are presented in Figure 5c,d. According to the obtained
results, in the partial nucleate boiling region, the bubble departure
frequency increases with graphene thickness, indicating the enhancing
effect of coating on surface cooling. Comparing the trends in obtained
results shown in Figure 5c,d, it can be seen that the differences between departure frequency
and bubble departure diameter for graphene-coated surfaces are much
smaller than for bare silicon surfaces. One of the main reasons for
such a trend on coated surfaces is attributed to the combination of
active nucleation sites on porous surfaces.

Although higher
heat-transfer coefficients are obtained for all
graphene-coated samples compared to bare silicon surface (as shown
in Figure 4), 3D graphene-coated
surfaces exhibit different trends for the partial boiling (ΔTsup < 15 K) and developed boiling (ΔTsup < 15 K) regions. In the partial nucleate
boiling region, the heat-transfer coefficient increases with graphene
thickness. For the developed boiling region, the heat-transfer coefficient
increases as the graphene thickness decreases down to 13 nm, beyond
which the obtained heat-transfer coefficients are lower than the ones
of the 13 nm thick sample. There are several factors causing the different
heat-transfer behaviors of 3D foamlike graphene coatings such as disconnected
pores, vapor column size, graphene interface evaporation, and mechanical
resonance of the 3D structure.

SEM images indicate that as graphene
thickness decreases, the number
of disconnected rods increases in the 3D branch (Supporting Information Note S5), which implies that the pore
sizes increase with the decrease in graphene thickness. One reason
for heat-transfer deterioration in the 8 nm thick sample is bubble
trapping in the porous structure. At high heat fluxes, the maximum
pore size is large enough to trap the bubbles and vapor blanket inside,
which acts as the insulator and deteriorates the heat-transfer performance
of the samples (Table 1).

The other factor affecting the heat-transfer mechanism in
the developed
nucleate boiling region is the formation of vapor column within the
3D graphene structure. As the wall heat flux increases, individual
bubbles form vapor layers within the coating, which influences the
developed nucleate boiling region. Figure 6a shows the departure bubbles at the heat
flux of 100 W/cm2 (for sample #3). The schematic of the
vapor column within the porous medium is shown in Figure 6b. Visualization studies reveal
different vapor column formation on graphene-coated samples, indicating
the effect of graphene thickness. As shown in Figure 6c,d, the coating with 55 nm thick graphene
structures generates smaller bubbles but more vapor columns compared
to the 8 nm thick graphene coating. According to the obtained results,
it is found that the vapor column size increases as the graphene thickness
decreases.

bubble
departure initiation upon a pore, (c) bubble departure and coalescence
on sample #3, and (d) bubble departure and coalescence on sample #1.

The forces acting on the vapor
column in the porous medium can
be determined by Bond (Bo = Δρga2/σ) and capillary () (nondimensional) numbers.64−66 Here, Δρ, g, a, σ,
η, u̅, and k are density
difference between vapor and water (kg·m–3),
gravity acceleration constant (m·s–2), the
characteristic length (e.g., pore radius), water–vapor surface
tension (N·m–1), dynamic viscosity (N·s·m–2), mean fluid velocity (m·s–1), and porous medium permeability, respectively. Because of lower
density, the resulting balance inside the porous medium forces the
vapor phase to form vapor columns in the saturated medium (fully developed
nucleate boiling). Graphene coatings with different pore sizes have
different Bond and capillary numbers such that coating with a higher
graphene coating thickness has denser and smaller pore sizes meaning
lower Bond number but higher capillary number for the corresponding
coating, which leads to smaller vapor column formation.

The
vapor column growth can also be analyzed based on the thermal
resistance network model proposed by Ha and Graham,67 which suggests that the heat transfer occurs by evaporation
at the interface. The other reason for higher heat-transfer coefficient
corresponding to 3D coatings with thinner graphene coatings is that
the evaporation in the larger interface area per volume enhances the
heat-transfer performance of such coatings. As expected, at high heat
fluxes, the graphene coating raises the bubble departure frequency.

Weak van der Waals forces between graphene layers enable graphene
layers to slide easily and give flexibility to the structure. The
resulting mechanical resonance due to the bubble nucleation effect
within the porous medium and reaction force of the departed bubble
on the coating surface alters boiling characteristics in foamlike
graphene coatings. Observed different bubble departure angles and
bubble coalescence shapes on coated surfaces with different graphene
thicknesses could be attributed to the mechanical resonance for the
3D structure (Supporting Information Note
S6).

This study presents pool boiling experiments conducted
on CVD-grown
3D foamlike graphene-coated surfaces to show the effect of graphene
coating thickness on the pool boiling heat-transfer performance. According
to the obtained results, the 3D structure of the coating has a significant
effect on pool boiling heat-transfer mechanisms. Effects such as pore
shape and mechanical resonance of the 3D structure are possible reasons
for different bubble behaviors in developed nucleate boiling. Furthermore,
there exists an optimum thickness of 3D graphene coatings, where the
highest performance was achieved. This is mainly due to the trapped
bubbles inside the porous medium for thick configurations, which affect
the bubble dynamics involving bubble departure diameter and frequency.
The results reveal that the facile method of producing 3D foamlike
graphene coatings implemented in this study can be used as an effective
alternative for boiling heat-transfer enhancement.
