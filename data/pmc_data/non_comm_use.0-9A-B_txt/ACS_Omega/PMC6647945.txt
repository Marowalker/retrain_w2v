The characterization of the segregation
phenomena in binary mixtures
of solids with very different densities and/or particle sizes is highly
relevant in many industrial processes. As a recent example, some advanced
CO2 capture systems using fluidized beds include the separation
by segregation of the functional materials. In this work, we have
conducted mixing-segregation experiments with particles of iron ore
(a typical oxygen carrier in chemical looping combustion systems)
acting as jetsam, and glass beads (representing a lower density solid
present in the bed) acting as flotsam, to measure solid concentration
profiles at different fluidizing gas velocities and mixture compositions
of different-sized particles. The experimental concentration profiles
have been interpreted using a modified version of the model proposed
by Gibilaro and Rowe. A relatively simple correlation is included
in the model to calculate the segregation model parameters, which
depend on the physical properties of the fluidized solids. The model
fits reasonably well with all experimental data, especially for mixtures
with a low fraction of oxygen carriers, which are the most relevant
for the design of future continuous separation of solids by segregation.

Introduction
Fluidized
beds containing mixtures of solids with different particle
size and/or density are commonly used in industrial processes. In
many cases, distinct degrees of mixing or segregation are required.1−4 This paper is motivated by recent proposals in the emerging field
of high-temperature solid looping cycles for CO2 capture,
which include a continuous separation step of dense solids.5−14 The targeted separation is usually between oxygen carrier particles
containing a transition metal and lighter solids in the bed: usually,
a porous CO2 sorbent material containing CaO or unconverted
solid fuel particles. In systems involving calcination of CaCO3, a large flow of dense solids oxidized in the air reactor
transports as sensitive heat at very high temperatures, the energy
needed for the regeneration of the CO2 sorbents.8,9,11,14 However, once the CO2 sorbent is regenerated, a sufficient
separation of the oxygen carrier from the lighter sorbent particles
is required. In a process under development by General Electric, Jayarathna
et al.11 achieved this solid separation
in experiments carried out in an entrainment bed. Other authors have
proposed the use of bubbling beds to favor the solid segregation in
this type of systems.6,8,9,15−19

The prediction of the behavior and fluid dynamics
of binary mixtures
is complex and the separation efficiency attainable by segregation
is highly uncertain. It is generally accepted20−27 that the action of bubbles in fluidized beds produces mixing of
the solid components, as well as low gas velocities, and different
physical properties between the solids of a mixture lead to the segregation
of the particles along the bed height. The lighter and/or smaller-sized
component will tend to accumulate at the top of the bed (flotsam)
and the heavier and/or larger-sized component will sink to the bottom
(jetsam). Mixing and segregation compete during fluidization causing
the mobility of the solids until a certain equilibrium distribution
is achieved.1,20,28−33 Numerous investigations to quantify where and how this equilibrium
is reached have been reported in the literature. Some researchers
have been dedicated to study the influence of the solid properties
on the axial solid concentration profiles resulting from segregation,30,34,35 to formulate indexes that quantify
the degree of mixing during fluidization23,36−38 or to predict the segregation direction.39,40 However, most of the early studies on segregation were extremely
sensitive to the particular characteristics of the solids and the
experimental setup, as no model was available to generalize the observations.

Gibilaro and Rowe20 first proposed a
two-phase model (GR model) to describe segregating fluidized beds,
in which the bed is assumed to be composed of the wake phase (i.e.,
the fraction of solids ascending with the bubbles) and of the bulk
phase (i.e., the rest of the solids in the bed). Three mechanisms
of mixing (circulation, exchange and axial mixing) and one of segregation,
represented by their corresponding parameters, are considered in the
model. With the circulation mechanism, the bubbles sweep along solids
from the bottom of the bed to the top. Then, the solids abandon the
wake phase to join the bulk and flow down. Moreover, there is a continuous
exchange of solids between the bulk and wake phases along the bed.
Finally, bubble movement causes axial mixing in the bulk phase, giving
rise to solid dispersion in the vertical direction that can be described
as a diffusion process. The segregation mechanism depends not only
on the flow of bubbles, but also on the difference in physical properties
of the solids (mainly density and size).1,20 Hence, during
the fluidization of a binary mixture that contains solids of similar
characteristics, the particles will tend to be uniformly arranged
along the bed. In contrast, when the solids greatly differ in density
and/or particle size, two clearly differenced zones will appear, that
is, a pure-jetsam region settled at the bottom of the bed and an upper
zone where the predominant component is the flotsam. Both zones are
separated at a critical height.20 In an
intermediate scenario, there will not be a pure-jetsam zone at the
bottom and a gradient of jetsam will be observed along the bed. These
concepts have been used in subsequent works to describe segregation
phenomena in numerous binary systems. Naimer et al.31 proposed correlations for the calculation of the GR model
parameters based on the properties of the bubbles and the solids and
solved the differential equations for jetsam-poor mixtures. Hoffmann
et al.22 extended the use of the previous
methodology to jetsam-rich and equal-density mixtures by redefining
some correlations. Bilbao et al.41 described
in detail the segregation of a mixture of straw and sand by modifying
the GR model accounting for the peculiar physical characteristics
of straw. García-Ochoa et al.42 focused
their research on binary mixtures of solids of group D according to
Geldart’s classification.43 The
values of the parameters of the GR model were directly obtained from
the fitting of the experimental results instead of using correlations
that depend on the operating conditions. Abanades et al.44 adapted the GR model to explain the segregation
during fluidization of mixtures of limestone and coal operating in
slugging regime. They observed that the circulation of solids depends
on the oscillations caused by the gas slugs and the particles are
segregated following a simple mechanism of free falling. In a more
recent work, Kumar et al.45 combined an
adapted version of the GR model with a pressure gradient model in
order to describe segregation in gas–solid vacuum-fluidized
beds.

Apart from the models, based on the GR model, other methodologies
have been developed to quantify the segregation phenomena in fluidized
beds. Tanimoto et al.46 investigated the
descending motion of different jetsams and calculated their downward
velocity by means of a model with no adjustable parameters, which
is especially suitable for mixtures of solids with similar minimum
fluidization velocity. Chen47 developed
a theoretical model only applicable for solid mixtures of the same
density, in which the bed is divided into a static phase at the bottom
and a well-mixed fluidized phase above the static phase. The segregation
is characterized by means of the initial solid concentration profile
and the physical properties of gas and particles. Burgess et al.,48 Yoshida et al.49 and
Gelperin et al.50 suggested different models
based on nondeterministic parameters (i.e., independent of the operating
conditions), which are difficult to relate to the behavior of the
solids mixture. Burgess et al.48 proposed
a numerical model, in which the bubble wake is assumed to be composed
of both unmixed and mixed fractions exchanging solids with the emulsion
phase. Yoshida et al.49 developed a model
only valid for mixtures of solids with the same density, assuming
that solid segregation is due to different exchange rates of particles
between the wake and bulk phases. Gelperin et al.50 proposed a two-parameter empirical model based on the mechanisms
of segregation and axial dispersion and only valid for equal-density
mixtures. Finally, Girimonte et al.51,52 have recently
developed a simple fundamental model to predict the axial solid concentration
profile from the fluidization velocity diagram by relating the fluidization
to the extent of segregation. This relationship is independent of
the effect of bubbling. The fluidization of binary mixtures has been
also studied using computational fluid dynamics.6,27,53−59 Its use has increased in the last two decades because of the improvements
in computational power and the increasing reliability of the codes
when modeling dense fluidized bed systems. These techniques have already
demonstrated their capability to obtain relevant information on the
segregation mechanism. However, their practical application to a wide
range of solid shape and size relevant in specific application is
not straightforward, and empirical approaches combined with semimechanistic
models of the segregating solid phases in the bed are still useful.

In this work, mixing-segregation experiments have been conducted
to investigate the segregation behavior of an iron oxide, which is
a typical oxygen carrier used in chemical looping combustion applications.60−68 The GR model framework has been adopted to interpret the observed
experimental results, showing a reasonable accuracy to capture the
main trends observed in the tests once the model parameters are tuned
to incorporate specific solid particle properties.

Results and Discussion
The effects of the fluidizing gas velocity, the mass fraction of
jetsam, and the particle size of the jetsam on solid segregation pattern
have been analyzed in detail for the binary mixtures listed in Table 2. In order to facilitate
the understanding of the results, the dimensionless number λ
that relates the circulation rate (w) with the segregation
rate (k) has been used as an indicator of the segregation
tendency of the solids mixture.20,31 Thus, higher values
of λ denote a lower tendency to segregate (i.e., higher values
of solid circulation rates and reduced segregation rates) and vice
versa.

Figure 1 shows the
axial concentration profiles for both mixtures I and II containing
a mass fraction of jetsam of 0.7 at increasing fluidizing gas velocities
of up to 0.31 m/s. As can be seen, the increase in gas velocity in
both fluidized mixtures results in a better mixing of the solids.
The critical height (z*) that separates the zones
enriched in jetsam and flotsam is slightly reduced and the concentration
of jetsam in the upper region of the bed increases at higher gas velocities.

Figure 1 Effect
of gas fluidizing velocity on segregation of mixture I (a–c)
and mixture II (d–f). Both mixtures contained a mass fraction
of jetsam of 0.7. Solid lines correspond to model predictions for ak = 1/3.

Moreover, the values calculated for λ demonstrate that
mixture
II (containing larger particles of iron oxide) exhibits greater tendency
to segregate. Lower values of λ were obtained for mixture II
(around 0.35 vs 0.40 for mixture I) in tests carried out at three
times higher gas velocities. As can be seen, the weight fractions
of jetsam in every condition tested are reasonably well predicted
by the model assuming a value of 1/3 for the adjustable parameter ak included in eq 17.

In Figure 2a, the
linear dependency of the segregation rate (k) with
the gas velocity (eq 17) is represented for both solid mixtures. As expected, higher values
of k are obtained for mixture II, which contains
larges particles of iron oxide. When operating with a fraction of
jetsam of 0.3 and around 0.1 m/s of inlet gas, a value of k of about 0.10 is obtained for mixture II. However, a significantly
lower value for k of about 0.06 is calculated in
the same conditions for mixture I. The effect of the gas velocity
on the solid circulation rate (w) is more moderate.
As can be seen in Figure 2b, a modest increase in λ is obtained at growing gas
flowrates in both mixtures. Moreover, higher fractions of jetsam favor
the mixing of the solids bed, giving rise to values for λ above
0.70 for both mixtures in the whole range of gas velocities tested.

Figure 2 (a) Evolution
of the parameter λ with the fluidizing gas
velocity. (b) Evolution of the segregation rate (eq 16) with the fluidizing gas velocity.
The fluidizing gas velocity ranged from 0.04 to 0.42 m/s.

Figure 3 illustrates
the effect of the jetsam concentration in the experimental and predicted
solid segregation profiles obtained at a constant fluidizing gas velocity.
A rise in xJ increases the tendency to
solid mixing. As a consequence of a higher proportion of jetsam in
the fluidized bed, the critical height (z*) that
separates the almost pure jetsam zone located at the bottom from the
upper region enriched in jetsam is increased. Moreover, greater concentrations
of jetsam above z* are observed at higher xJ and the segregation profiles are gradually
less pronounced.

Figure 3 Effect of the mass fraction of jetsam on the segregation:
(a) mixture
I; u0 = 0.10 m/s; λ(xJ=0.3) = 0.29, λ(xJ=0.7) = 0.41, λ(xJ=0.9) = 0.72. (b) Mixture II; u0 = 0.22 m/s; λ(xJ=0.3) = 0.24, λ(xJ=0.7) =
0.35. Solid lines correspond to model predictions for ak = 1/3.

This trend is confirmed in Figure 4, in which the evolution of the parameter
λ with
the mass fraction of jetsam is represented. Mixing gains importance
with respect to segregation in mixtures containing about 0.9 fraction
of jetsam, giving rise to calculated values of λ between 0.7
and 0.92. In contrast, in mixtures with lower amount of jetsam (xJ < 0.55), the segregation phenomenon clearly
prevails and values of λ of below 0.3 are obtained.

Figure 4 Evolution of
the parameter λ with the mass fraction of jetsam.

The effect of the particle size of the denser solid
on the segregation
profiles at two different gas velocities is represented in Figure 5 (maintaining a constant xJ of 0.3 in the tests). As can be seen in Table 2, the mixture II that
contains larger particles sizes of iron oxide (i.e., of between 355
and 400 μm vs 200–250 μm of mixture I) exhibits
a much higher ratio of minimum fluidization velocities of its components
(up/uf = 28).
During the fluidization of mixture II, the zone of the bed enriched
in jetsam is expanded and the critical height z*
is located above that observed during the fluidization of the mixture
I, regardless of the inlet gas velocity. The values of λ obtained
for mixture II are significantly lower and they are less affected
by growing gas velocities, which demonstrates a greater tendency to
segregate of this solids mixture.

Figure 5 Influence of the particle size of the
denser solid in the segregation
profiles. Test conditions for both mixtures: (a) xJ = 0.3; u0 = 0.05 m/s; (b) xJ = 0.3; u0 = 0.10
m/s. Solid lines correspond to model predictions for ak = 1/3.

In Figure 6, the
average volumetric fractions of jetsam obtained at the different experimental
conditions are compared with the concentrations predicted by the model
assuming a value of 1/3 for the adjustable parameter ak (eq 17). As can be seen, the model gives a satisfactory prediction of jetsam
concentration, especially for the experiments carried out with mixture
II containing a Cave of below 0.5. However,
the model tends to underpredict the values of the average volumetric
fractions of jetsam for experiments with mixture I containing Cave higher than 0.3.

Figure 6 Comparison between the
experimental average volumetric fractions
of jetsam and the calculated values according to the model proposed
with ak = 1/3. Tests were carried out
with u0 ranging from 0.04 to 0.42 and xJ from 0.3 to 0.9.

As explained above, several authors74−76 have calculated
the
segregation rate coefficient (k) proposed by Naimer
et al.31 (eq 8) on the basis of different formulations for the dimensionless
segregation distance (Y̅s), which
depends not only on the physical properties of the solids but also
on the fluid dynamics of the bed (eqs 14–16).

Figure 7 compares
the quality of the fit of different correlations reported in the literature
with the equation proposed in this work. As can be seen, the correlations
proposed by Hoffmann and Romp.75 and Dechsiri
et al.76 (eqs 15 and 16, respectively)
describe accurately the segregation profiles of mixtures with low
concentrations of jetsam (Figure 8a,c). However, both equations fail when predicting
segregation patterns of high jetsam concentration mixtures (Figure 7b,d). Better results
are obtained with the model based on the dimensionless segregation
distance proposed by Tanimoto et al.,74 but considerable deviations from the experimental data are still
observed. With respect to the correlation proposed in this work, the
segregation profiles are more accurately described in general, especially
for mixtures with low fractions of jetsam.

predictions of the experimental axial concentration
profiles according to the model proposed and those obtained from other
models reported in the literature.74−76 Experimental conditions:
(a) mixture I, xJ = 0.3, u0 = 0.06 m/s; (b) mixture I, xJ = 0.9, u0 = 0.12 m/s; (c) mixture II, xJ = 0.3, u0 = 0.10
m/s; (d) mixture II, xJ = 0.7, u0 = 0.18 m/s.

the calculation of the segregation parameter k according

These results demonstrate
that the proposed model, which is based
on parameters relatively easy to estimate, is able to predict the
segregation patterns of binary mixtures with solids differing sufficiently
in their physical properties, regardless of the velocity of the fluidizing
gas and the mass fraction of jetsam in the mixture.

Conclusions
A model based on that reported by Gibilaro and Rowe20 has been proposed to describe the segregation
of solids with very different physical properties during fluidization.
Apart from the segregation phenomenon, the solid circulation from
the bottom to the top of the fluidized bed (and vice versa), and the
exchange of solids between the wake and bulk phases determine the
distribution of the flotsam and jetsam during fluidization. However,
the influence of the axial mixing in the bulk phase to the mixing
process is assumed to be negligible in view of the experimental results.
A relatively simple correlation to calculate the segregation rate,
which only depends on the physical properties of the fluidized solids,
has been included in the model. The fluidization of two different
binary mixtures containing glass spheres of 70–110 μm
and iron oxide particles of 200–250 and 355–400 μm,
respectively, has been studied. Mass fractions of jetsam from 0.3
to 0.9 have been tested in both mixtures using fluidizing gas velocities
ranging between 0.04 and 0.42 m/s. It has been observed that higher
fluidizing gas velocities favor the mixing of the solids. A raise
in the proportion of jetsam also increases the tendency to the solid
mixing, giving rise to less-pronounced segregation profiles. In contrast,
larger particle sizes of jetsam result in stronger solid segregation.
The model developed in this work is able to describe accurately the
solid concentration profiles in every condition tested, especially
in the tests carried out with relatively low proportion of jetsam.
A comparison with other segregation models available in the literature
has demonstrated that the proposed model describes better the segregation
profiles of this kind of solids mixtures in a wider range of operating
conditions.

Methodology
The experiments to study the segregation
of binary mixtures during
fluidization were carried out at room temperature and at atmospheric
pressure using a 1 m high methacrylate column with an inner diameter
of 42 mm (see Figure 1a). Ten pressure taps separated 30 mm each other along the column
allowed the measurement of nine ΔP at different
heights. The electric signals generated by the pressure sensors were
registered in a computer using a data logger. Air, regulated by a
mass flow controller, was used as fluidizing gas. A perforated plate
was used as the distributor of the air in the fluidized bed. A gas
flow rate between 3 and 35 Nl/min was fed into the column depending
on the test. Iron oxide particles of between 200 and 400 μm
obtained after crushing and sieving solids of mineral ore were mixed
in different proportions (from 30 to 90% wt) with glass spheres with
particle diameters of between 70 and 110 μm. Amounts of solids
from 350 to 750 g were loaded in the column depending on the experiment.
The main characteristics of the solids used in this work are detailed
in Table 1.

In a typical experiment, a mixture of solids
with known concentration
is exposed to strong fluidization (i.e., gas velocities of between
0.3 and 0.6 m/s) for 5–10 min. Then, the flow of inlet gas
is cutoff, thereby obtaining a perfectly mixed-solid bed. Later, the
bed is subjected to fluidization at a gas velocity above the minimum
fluidization velocity (umf) of the component
with higher umf (typically the jetsam,
although this is not always the case30)
in order to induce the segregation of the components. The flow of
air should be kept constant until an equilibrium distribution of the
solids is achieved. In that moment, the air flow is cutoff again in
order to freeze the bed, so that the axial concentration profile can
be determined following the procedure developed in a previous work.69

The proposed methodology basically consists
in calculating the
minimum fluidization velocity from pressure drop measurements at different
inlet gas velocities.70,71 For this purpose, the pressure
drops measured at different heights of the bed are recorded at increasing
gas velocities and after that, the minimum fluidization velocity can
be easily derived from the Ergun equation.70 These gas velocities should be sufficiently low to avoid any alteration
of the solids concentration profile. Finally, the concentration of
jetsam at each bed slice is obtained from the umf measured,72 by applying the correlation
developed by Turrado et al.,69 which relates
the minimum fluidization of the mixture measured at a certain slice
of the bed with the mass fraction of jetsam present there (xp) and the minimum fluidization velocity of
the pure components (up and uf), by means of a mixture-dependent parameter 1  

This correlation is particularly
appropriate for mixtures of solids
with very different umf as the two binary
mixtures (I and II, as indicated in Table 2) investigated in
this work (mixture I: b = 1.88 + 0.79xp; mixture II: b = 3.02).69 Mixture I and mixture II contain glass spheres
of 70–110 μm combined with iron oxide particles of 200–250
and 355–400 μm, respectively. Mass fractions of jetsam
(xJ) from 0.3 to 0.9 were tested with
both mixtures using fluidizing gas velocities ranging between 0.04
and 0.42 m/s.

Mathematical Model
A modification of the GR model20 was used
to provide an interpretation for the
segregation patterns observed experimentally in this work. The GR
model considers three mechanisms responsible for mixing and one for
segregation. Each mechanism is represented by a parameter: w, q, r, and k, which are the solid circulation rate, the exchange rate, the axial
mixing rate, and segregation rate, respectively. The influence of
the axial mixing in the bulk phase to the mixing process was assumed
to be negligible (i.e., the case 2 of the GR model20) as any experimental evidence of this phenomenon was observed
during the tests.31,46 In the GR model, it is assumed
that neither mixing nor segregation occurs in the horizontal plane
and that w, q, and k are independent of the bed height. Furthermore, different packing
densities along the bed and the space occupied by the bubbles were
ignored when considering elementary volumes of the bed. Therefore,
the following differential equations, that describe the jetsam movement
in the bulk and in wake phase, are obtained when solving the balance
to an elementary slice of the bed of thickness dz20 2   3  where CB and CW are the volumetric fraction of
jetsam in the
bulk and wake phase, respectively, z is the normalized
height and H the total bed height. The average jetsam
concentration in the bed (Cave) can be
calculated from the fraction of solids in the wake phase (Fw) as follows 4  

The parameters Fw, w, q, and k can be obtained from
the correlations proposed by Naimer et al.31 5   6   7   8  where aB′ is the volume fraction
of wakes and bubbles in the bed, FWB is
the volume fraction of the wake in the bubble, aB is the volume fraction of bubbles in the bed, ub is the bubble rise velocity, db is the bubble diameter, ϵmf is the bed voidage
at minimum fluidization velocity, and Y̅s is the dimensionless segregation distance. The equations
taken from literature for their calculation are listed in Table 3.

According to Naimer et al.,31 the segregation
rate coefficient k, which represents the net downward
flow of the jetsam compared to the ascending flotsam, is great affected
by the fluid dynamics of the bed (eq 8). However, during the experimental campaigns solid
segregation was observed to depend basically on the physical properties
of the fluidized solids. The segregation rate coefficient k was calculated as an adjustable parameter to find the
most accurate description of the experimental results. The value of k obtained for each condition depended on the fluidizing
gas velocity, the minimum fluidization velocity of the mixture, the
particle sizes, and bed composition. According to that, the following
correlation to determine the segregation coefficient rate was formulated 17  where ak is an
adjustable parameter, dJ and dF are the particle diameter of the jetsam and flotsam,
respectively, xJ is the mass fraction
of jetsam, u0 the fluidizing gas velocity
and umf the minimum fluidization velocity
of the mixture for that specific mass fraction of jetsam.

During
the experiments, it was observed that most of the solids
located above the critical height z* (whose value
varied depending on the fluidization conditions) were flotsam. Hence,
it was assumed for the calculations that the properties of the solids
located in that part of the column were inalterable and corresponded
to the flotsam. Moreover, the bubble size was considered to be about
half of the column diameter (i.e., 21 mm) and remained stable during
the upward movement, in the same way that other fluid–dynamic
parameters, such as the bubble rise velocity (ub), the volume fraction of the wake in the bubble (FWB), the volume fraction of solids in the wake
(Fw) and the coefficients of segregation
(k), exchange (q), and circulation
(w).

The methodology followed in this work
to solve the differential
equations and then obtain the critical height and the segregation
constant (k) that better describes the experimental
results is represented in Figure 8b. The bubble properties were first estimated by means
of eqs 9–13, which allowed the fraction of solids in the wake
phase (Fw) and the parameters of exchange
and circulation (q and w, respectively)
to be obtained (eqs 5–7). Because the value of z* cannot be directly derived from the experimental data, an iterative
procedure was followed to obtain both the critical height (z*) and segregation rate (k). Thus, an
arbitrary critical height (z*) was initially assumed
and a value of the parameter k was obtained by applying
least-squares fitting to the experimental curves. If the supposed
values of z* and k fulfilled the
mass balance represented by eq 18, they could be considered valid. If not, the value obtained
for the arbitrary critical height (z*′) that
closed the mass balance was used in the following iteration, thereby
calculating the corresponding new value of k. 18  

This procedure
was successively repeated until the convergence
was achieved. Once the segregation coefficient rates (k) were estimated for every solids mixture and fluidizing conditions
tested, the adjustable parameter ak, that
relates the segregation rate with gas velocity and solid bed properties
(eq 17), was calculated
by least-squares method.
