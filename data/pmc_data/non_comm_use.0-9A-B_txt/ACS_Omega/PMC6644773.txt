The electronic properties
of amide linkers, which are intricate
components of biomolecules, offer a wealth of unexplored possibilities.
Herein, we demonstrate how the different modes of attaching an amide
to a pyrene chromophore affect the electrochemical and optical properties
of the chromophore. Thus, although they cause minimal spectral shifts,
amide substituents can improve either the electron-accepting or electron-donating
capabilities of pyrene. Specifically, inversion of the amide orientation
shifts the reduction potentials by 200 mV. These trends indicate that,
although amides affect to a similar extent the energies of the ground
and singlet excited states of pyrene, the effects on the doublet states
of its radical ions are distinctly different. This behavior reflects
the unusually strong orientation dependence of the resonance effects
of amide substituents, which should extend to amide substituents on
other types of chromophores in general. These results represent an
example where the Hammett sigma constants fail to predict substituent
effects on electrochemical properties. On the other hand, Swain–Lupton
parameters are found to be in good agreement with the observed trends.
Examination of the frontier orbitals of the pyrene derivatives and
their components reveals the underlying reason for the observed amide
effects on the electronic properties of this polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon
and points to key molecular-design strategies for electronic and energy-conversion
systems.

1 Introduction
The
importance of amides as building blocks in living systems cannot
be overstated. Peptide bonds hold proteins together, and the amide
propensity for hydrogen bonding defines the secondary structures and
the functionality of these biopolymers.1−3 Since the invention of
nylon,4 synthetic polyamides have been
at the forefront of materials science and engineering.5−9 Due to their extended π-conjugation, amide bonds are rigid
and assume planer conformations.10−14

In addition to functioning as bonding elements
and hydrogen-bonding
cross-linkers, amides also have interesting electronic properties.
The amide dipoles, ranging between 3 and 5 D,15 render many vital enzymatic and cellular processes possible.16−18 Ordered amide and hydrogen bonds give rise to the enormous macrodipoles
of protein helices,18−21 providing guidelines for bioinspired designs.22−32 In addition to making ion channels functional,17,33 such dipolar amide conjugates prove invaluable for rectifying the
directionality of electron transfer and transport.21,34−39 Aliphatic amides oxidize at about 1.5 V versus saturated calomel
electrode (SCE)40 and have optical gaps
of 5.6 eV between their highest occupied molecular orbitals (HOMOs)
and lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMOs), corresponding to
an n−π* transition around 222 nm,11 making them electron-rich π-conjugated UV absorbers.

Except for a few reports on how the orientation of amide bonds
affects molecular properties, such as enantioselectivity, catalytic
activity, and the biological uptake of nanoconstructs,41−43 the understanding of the effects of this important substituent on
the characteristics of organic chromophores remains in the realm of
empirical deductions. Even the classical Hammett constants predict
that, regardless of their orientation, amides should be electron-withdrawing
groups.44 However, the Swain–Lupton
resonance parameters, accounting for the mesomeric effects of functional
groups,45 do suggest that there should
be a difference between the effects of amides attached via their nitrogens
or via their carbonyl carbons.44,45

Substituent effects
on electronically excited states correlate
roughly with ground-state descriptors such as Hammett constants. However,
because it is the difference between the ground and excited states
that defines the optical properties of a molecule, if a substituent
affects the energies of both the ground and excited states in the
same manner, the shifts in the optical spectra will be negligible,
regardless of how strong these effects are. Furthermore, despite all
advances in physical organic chemistry during the 20th century, the
search for reliable descriptors of substituent effects on excited-state
properties is still in its infancy.46 Thus,
systematic studies on how amides and other substituents affect transitions
between different electronic states are important for filling key
voids in physical organic chemistry and other pertinent fields.

The question of interest here is, aside from serving as linkers,
hydrogen-bonding sites, and dipole sources, how do amide functionalities
impact the electronic properties of π-conjugated moieties to
which they are attached?

To test this capability of amides,
we focus on pyrene as the π-conjugated
moiety. Pyrene and its derivatives are among the most widely used
chromophores due to their good fluorescence quantum yields (φf) and the unusually long lifetime (τ) of the singlet
excited states.47−50 The potentials at which they oxidize and reduce make pyrenes a popular
choice as electron donors and acceptors.51−57 Along with their attractive optical and electrochemical properties,
the strong propensity for self-assembly via π-stacking, which
pyrene and its derivatives exhibit,58−60 allows them to serve
as building blocks for electronic and photonic materials and interfaces.61−71

To examine how amides affect the electronic properties of
pyrene,
we attach them in opposite orientations directly to the aromatic ring (PyN-C and PyC-N, Chart 1). Insertion of a methylene linker (PymN-C and PymC-N, Chart 1) breaks the  π-conjugation between the
amide and the pyrene moiety, permitting an evaluation of the amide
effects in the absence of strong electronic coupling with the polycyclic
aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Unlike other π-conjugating substituents,
such as nitro, nitroso, and alkanoyl groups,54,72 amides, even when directly attached to pyrene, cause small shifts
in the UV/visible absorption and fluorescence spectra. The most profound
effect of the amides is on the reduction potentials of oxidation and
reduction of pyrene. Thus, although amides affect to a similar extent
the energies of the ground and singlet excited states of pyrene, their
effects on the doublet states of their radical ions are quite different.

2 Results
2.1 Molecular-Design Considerations
Amide
coupling between the corresponding amine and carboxylic-acid derivatives
yields the pyrene–amide conjugates in good yields after chromatographic
purification and recrystallization steps (Chart 1). The positions 1, 3, 6, and 8 (PyN-C on Chart 1) are the most susceptible to electrophilic
and radical substitutions.72−74 Therefore, this study focuses
on pyren-1-yl amides (Chart 1).

2.2 Amide Effects on Optical
Properties of Pyrene
The optical spectra of the four pyrene–amide
derivatives
(Chart 1) investigated
here show features characteristic of pyrene. In addition to the transitions
to upper excited states, the substituents perturb the symmetry of
pyrene, enhancing the intensity of the symmetry-forbidden S0 → S1 electronic absorption at 375 nm (Figure 1a). Although the
perturbation of the symmetry is stronger for PyN-C and PyC-N than for the methylene-linked derivatives, the amide substituents
do not cause large spectral shifts (Figure 1a). The spectra of PymN-C and PymC-N resemble those of alkyl-substituted pyrenes,58,75 indicating that methylene linkers do indeed effectively reduce the
interaction between the amide and the pyrene π-conjugated system.
Direct attachment of the amide via its carbon, PyC-N, broadens the absorption and emission
bands (Figure 1a) and
decreases the zero-to-zero transition energy  by less than kBT (Table 1). Attaching the amide moiety via its nitrogen, PyN-C,  enhances the spectral broadening
and decrease  a bit further.

The emission-decay kinetics shows the same trends
(Figure 1b). PymN-C and PymC-N exhibit large values of τ (Table 1), which are comparable
to those of alkyl-substituted
pyrenes.58,60,75 Attaching
the amide directly via its carbonyl carbon, PyC-N, shortens τ, reflecting the enhancement
of the intensity of the symmetry-forbidden S1 →
S0 transition. Attaching the amide group via its nitrogen, PyN-C, shortens τ even
further (Figure 1b
and Table 1).

Stoke’s shifts (Δν), estimated from the absorption
and emission maxima at about 340 and 380 nm, respectively, encompass
S2 → S1 internal conversion as well as
relaxation of S1. The latter is small, since the Δν
values using the S0 → S1 absorption are
minute and are comparable to those of quantum dots and solid-state
materials (Table 1).76−78 This finding indicates that solvation effects following photoexcitation
do not appreciably perturb the geometry of these pyrene derivatives.

The photophysical trends (Figure 1 and Table 1) reflect the consequences of π-conjugation of the amide
with the PAH. The effects are, indeed, more pronounced when the amide
is directly attached via its nitrogen than its carbonyl carbon. Also,
the close resemblance between the properties of PymN-C and PymC-N indicates that the amide electric dipoles, which generate
large fields even across methylene linkers,39 are not responsible for the observed effects. The lack of a significant
solvent dependence of  and Δν (Table 1) further confirms that amide
dipoles do
not contribute to the differences between the photophysics of the
four derivatives. The decrease in φf and τ
in chlorinated solvents (Table 1), which was also reported for pyrene itself,50 may be a polarity effect. Photoinduced charge-transfer
interactions with the solvent, however, might account for it
as well.79

2.3 Amide
Effects on Reduction and Oxidation Properties
of Pyrene
Cyclic voltammetry of the pyreneamides, dissolved
in MeCN, shows that all derivatives except PyC-N have reduction potentials (EPy|Py•–) around −2 V versus
SCE (Figure 2 and Table 2). For PyC-N, EPy|Py•– = −1.8 V versus SCE. The potentials
at which pyrenes oxidize, expressed as reduction potentials of the
radical cations (EPy•+|Py), range from 1.2 V versus SCE for PyN-C to 1.4 V versus SCE for PyC-N (Table 2).
The electrochemical HOMO–LUMO gaps, i.e., EPy•+|Py – EPy|Py•–, match the optical  quite well (Tables 1 and 2). This finding
suggests a negligible difference between the energies of the solvated
ions and the photoexcited species.80

basis set were used together with implementation of the polarizable
continuum model (PCM).

at which oxidation occurs,

d Reduction potential of the pyrene
derivatives, i.e., Py + e– → Py•–.

Overall, attaching the
amide group to pyrene via the carbonyl carbon
lowers the energy of the HOMO and LUMO, enhancing the propensity of
the pyrene chromophore to act as an electron acceptor. Conversely,
attaching the amide group via the nitrogen elevates the energy of
the pyrene HOMO without affecting the energy of the LUMO. This narrowing
of the HOMO–LUMO gap, reflected in the value of , makes PyN-C a better electron donor than the other three
derivatives.

For dichloromethane (DCM), the potentials at which
the pyrenes
oxidize, expressed as reduction potentials of the radical cations,
show the same trends but are shifted to more positive values by about
100–200 mV in comparison with those for MeCN (Table 2). Thus, a decrease in the polarity
of the medium destabilizes the radical cations that are formed upon
oxidation and increases the corresponding reduction potentials of
the oxidized pyreneamides, EPy•+|Py. Unfortunately, the reduction potentials of the pyrene
derivatives, EPy|Py•–, are outside the electrochemical window of DCM and the potentials
at which both the oxidation and reduction occur are both outside the
electrochemical window of CHCl3.

To address the lack
of electrochemical information for these cases,
we resort to density functional theory (DFT) calculations of the ionization
energies (IE) and electron affinities (EA) of the pyrene derivatives.
The values of IE and EA show the same trends as those of the reduction
potentials and provide information on the reduction and oxidation
properties that are electrochemically inaccessible for some of the
solvents. For each of the pyrene derivatives, IE increases and EA
decreases with a decrease in the solvent polarity (Table 2), which is consistent with
destabilization of both doublet states, i.e., of the radical cation
and the radical anion. Thus, a decrease in medium polarity increases
the electrochemical HOMO–LUMO gap, i.e., EPy•+|Py – EPy|Py•– ≈ IE – EA, while  is invariant with the solvent.
For low-polarity
solvents, therefore, the stabilization due to Coulombic interactions
between the photogenerated hole and the unpaired electron in the singlet
excited state becomes particularly important.

In contrast to
the amide effects on the optical properties of the
pyrene derivatives, which appear to be subtle, the effects on their
electrochemical behavior are substantial when the amide is directly
attached to the chromophore. Inverting the orientation of the amide
causes a 200 mV shift in the reduction potentials, which can represent
a huge difference in the design of molecules for electronics and optoelectronics.

Attaching an amide via its carbonyl carbon causes positive shifts
in both reduction potentials, EPy•+|Py and EPy|Py•– (Table 2),
and some broadening of the absorption and emission bands (Figure 1a) but does not lead
to dramatic bathochromic shifts or to a decrease in  (Figure 1a and Table 1). In contrast, attaching the amide via its nitrogen
results
in much more evident changes in the optical properties of pyrene,
broadening the absorption and emission spectra and decreasing , φf, and τ
(Figure 1 and Table 1). In addition, PyN-C exhibits a negative shift
of EPy•+|Py and no shift
of EPy|Py•– (Table 2), affecting the energy
of the
HOMO but not of the LUMO of the pyrene chromophore. This narrowing
of the HOMO–LUMO gap, which is related to π-conjugation
between the pyrene chromophore and the amide substituent, is characteristic
of PyN-C as compared with
the other three derivatives.

3 Discussion
The evidence suggests that π-conjugation of the amides with
the pyrene rings is the underlying reason for observed trends. Amides
have substantial permanent electric dipoles15 that can readily affect not only the electrochemical behavior of
these derivatives by stabilizing or destabilizing the formed radical
ions but also may affect the optical properties of the polarizable
pyrene via an intramolecular Stark effect.84 The amide dipole, however, points from the oxygen to the nitrogen
of the bond,15 which is tangential to the
pyrene rings for the four derivatives under investigation. The two
methylene-linked derivatives, PymN-C and PymC-N, provide
the most important evidence that the amide dipoles do not play a significant
role in the observed trends. When the amide substituent cannot participate
in direct π-conjugation with the pyrene chromophore, the inversion
of the orientation of the amide dipole does not alter the reduction
or oxidation propensities of these pyrenes (PymC-N vs PymN-C, Table 2). Furthermore, if the amide dipoles
had exerted significant effects, a lowering of the solvent polarity
should induce differences between the reduction potentials or the
IE and EA of PymN-C and PymC-N. Therefore, it is safe
to assume that direct electronic interactions between the amides and
the pyrene chromophore govern the observed trends in this study. Thus,
field effects, prevalent for PyC-N, represent induction through σ bonds, rather than through-space
interactions provoked by the orientation of the amide dipole-generated
fields.

The Hammett substituent constants, σp and σm, suggest that amide groups should be preferentially
electron-withdrawing,
regardless of the orientation in which they are bound to an aromatic
ring. When attached via carbon, e.g., −CONHCH3,
the Hammett sigma constants are σp = 0.34 and σm = 0.35,44 characterizing the amide
as a moderately good electron-withdrawing group in ground-state reactions.
Likewise, when the amide is attached via its nitrogen, e.g., −NHCOCH3,44 the values are σp = 0.00 and σm = 0.21, which makes it electron-withdrawing
in the meta and neither electron withdrawing nor electron donating
in the para position on a benzene ring, contradicting our spectroscopic
and electrochemical findings.

Amide bonds oxidize at about 1.3–1.8
V versus SCE, which
is relatively close to the EPy•+|Py of pyrene, ensuring effective mixing between the HOMOs
of the pyrene and the amide substituent. The large HOMO–LUMO
gap of amides, however, indicate that the reduction of an amide group
should occur at potentials more negative than about −4 V versus
SCE. Hence, this precludes strong mixing between the high-energy LUMO
of the amide and the much lower energy LUMO of pyrene.

Considering
the HOMOs of pyrene and the amide reveals a drastic
difference between the propensities for π-conjugation of the
carbon-bonded and nitrogen-bonded orientations of the substituent.
Driven by protein science, semiclassical studies of the electronic
structures of amides clearly reveal that the HOMO of the amide group
is a nonbonding orbital on the oxygen and HOMO – 1 is a π-orbital,
also with a nonbonding character, localized on nitrogen and oxygen
with a node on the carbon.11 Although HOMO
– 2 of the amide is delocalized over the carbon, nitrogen,
and oxygen, it is much lower in energy than the HOMO – 1.11

DFT calculations of the simplest carboxamide,
i.e., formamide,
illustrate these trends (Figure 3). Many of the frontier orbitals have nonbonding or
σ-character distribution over the plane of the amide bond and
cannot mix with the π-orbitals of coplanar aromatic rings. Even
though the amide LUMO has a π character, its high energy level
makes such π-conjugation unfavorable, which is consistent with
the observed trends in the reduction potentials and the EA (Table 2).

Figure 3 Molecular-orbital diagram
of CHONH2 showing the frontier
orbitals obtained from DFT calculation at the B3LYP/6-311G(3df,3dp)
level of theory with implementation of MeCN as a solvation medium
(, IE – EA = 7.2 eV, , i.e., 222
nm, EA•+|A ≈
1.8 V vs SCE40).

The HOMO – 1 of the amide reveals the underlying reason
for the orientation dependence of the observed effects. The HOMO –
1 has a π-character with a node on the carbon (Figure 3) that would suppress π-conjugation
with coplanar aromatic rings connected directly to the carbonyl carbon.
The HOMOs of pyrene connected to the amide nitrogen, however, could
interact with the HOMO – 1 of the amide. The HOMO –
2 of the amide is its only π-orbital with no orthogonal nodal
planes but its much lower energy (than the HOMO) makes mixing with
the frontier orbitals of pyrene energetically unfavorable. Overall,
attaching the amide group directly to the pyrene chromophore via the
nitrogen favors mixing between the HOMO – 1 of the amide and
the HOMOs of pyrene. Conversely, mixing with the HOMOs of pyrene is
much less favorable when the amide is attached via its carbon.

Unlike conventional Hammett sigma constants, the Swain–Lupton
field  and resonance  parameters
for substituent effects45 of an amide group
capture this dependence on
the bonding orientation and thus provide a much better rationalization
of the experimentally observed trends than the Hammett sigma values.
For −CONHCH3, the Swain–Lupton parameters
are  and  and for −NHCOCH3,  and .44 Hence, the
inductive or field effects are indicative of electron withdrawal and
would be expected to be similar for both bonding orientations. In
contrast, the electron-donating mesomeric effect of the electron pair
on nitrogen should dominate in the latter orientation, consistent
with the observed difference between the properties of PyN-C and PyC-N.

The Swain–Lupton empirical parameters can also rationalize
the differences between the effects observed here for amides and those
of other carbonyl substituents. As an example, for an acetyl group,
−COCH3,  and . These values indicate that the propensity
of −COCH3 for mesomeric electron withdrawal should
be stronger than that of −CONHCH3. Indeed, alkanoyl
pyrene derivatives not only undergo reduction at potentials that are
less negative than those of PyC-N(54) but also exhibit a bathochromic
shift of the first π → π* absorption band to 400
nm.85

This example emphasizes another
important point. Bathochromic spectral
shifts indicate that the substituent lowers the energies of the excited
states more than that of the ground state. In our compounds, such
shifts do not occur even when the amide is directly attached to the
pyrene moiety. Such direct attachment, however, does affect the reduction
potentials (Table 2), implying that the amide substituents have much stronger effects
on the radical ions than on the singlet excited states. In classical
terms, this trend is consistent with through-resonance, which is pronounced
for electron-donating substituents bound to aromatic rings with positively
charged groups and for electron-withdrawing substituents bound to
aromatics with negatively charged groups. The pyrene derivatives under
investigation have only one substituent. Nevertheless, upon electrochemical
oxidation or reduction, the doublet states of the radical ions are
considerably more susceptible to through-resonance interactions with
the amides than is the case for the electroneutral singlet states.

Although the Swain–Lupton parameters for methylene-linked
amides suggest the possibility of a hyperconjugation effect across
the methylene group (i.e., for −CH2NHCOCH3 and for −CH2CONHCH3),44 DFT calculations
reveal that the frontier orbitals of PymN-C and PymC-N are
practically the same: localized on the pyrene chromophore with a negligible
delocalization over the amide group. The HOMO of PyC-N shows similar patterns. In contrast,
the HOMO and the LUMO of PyN-C are heavily delocalized over the amide and pyrene rings (Figure 4). These DFT results
agree with the spectroscopic and electrochemical trends and confirm
that the amide effects arise from differences in the propensity for
π-conjugation between the different bonding orientations.

at the B3LYP/6-311+G(d,p) level of theory: HOMO and LUMO, showing
the different extents of delocalization over the amide substituents,
which is most pronounced for PyN-C and least pronounced for PymN-C and PymC-N. In
fact, the delocalization in the HOMO of PyC-N is quite similar to that in the HOMOs of PymN-C and PymC-N.

4 Conclusions
This study demonstrates that
amides are not benign linking groups
and manifest additional complexity in the interaction of their electronic
structures with π-conjugated chromophores. Along with their
enormous electric dipoles and ability to form ordered hydrogen-bonded
networks, the judicious inclusion and orientation of amide substituents
provides a powerful tool for molecular, supramolecular, and materials
designs. Elucidation of the origins of the observed effects in the
present set of duly chosen pyrene conjugates suggests that the present
findings can be safely extrapolated to other amide-substituted polycyclic
aromatic hydrocarbon derivatives, as well as to other π-conjugated
chromophores in general.

5.2 Optical Spectroscopy
Steady-state
absorption spectra are recorded in the transmission mode using a JASCO
V-670 spectrophotometer (Tokyo, Japan). The steady-state emission
spectra and the time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC) fluorescence
decays are measured using a FluoroLog-3 spectrofluorometer (Horiba
Jobin Yvon, Edison, NJ), equipped with a pulsed diode laser (λ
= 278 nm, 0.9 ns pulse width), as previously reported.86−88

The wavelengths of the maxima of the absorption and emission
spectra were obtained from fitting the spectral peaks with Gaussian
functions. For estimating zero-to-zero energy, , of a
conjugate, we plot its absorption
and fluorescence spectra on the same graph where the fluorescence
maximum is adjusted to be equal to the maximum of the band at the
red edge of the absorption spectrum.  is estimated
from the wavelength at which
the thus normalized spectra cross (Table 1a). The fluorescence quantum yields, φf (Table 1),
were determined by comparing the integrated emission intensities of
the samples with those of the reference, an ethanol solution of Coumarin
151 (φf0 = 0.49)89−93 1  where F(λ) is the fluorescence
intensity at wavelength λ, A(λex) is the absorbance at the excitation wavelength, n is the refractive index of the medium, and the subscript “0”
indicates the quantities for the reference solution.

5.3 Electrochemistry
Cyclic voltammetry
was conducted using a Reference 600TM potentiostat/galvanostat/ZRA
(Gamry Instruments, PA), connected to a three-electrode cell, as previously
described.82,83 Glassy carbon electrode and platinum
wire were used for the working and counter electrodes, respectively.
A saturated calomel electrode (Gamry Instruments) was used for a reference
electrode. To prevent contamination, the reference electrode was brought
in contact with the sample solution via a salt bridge. When not in
use, the reference electrode is stored submersed in saturated potassium
chloride solution.

Anhydrous aprotic solvents with different
polarity, dichloromethane (DCM) and acetonitrile (MeCN), were employed
with different concentrations of tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate
((n-C4H9)4NPF6) as the supporting electrolyte. Prior to recording each voltammogram,
the sample was extensively purged with argon while maintaining its
volume constant by adding more anhydrous solvent. For each solvent,
a set of voltammograms was recorded from 25 to 200 mM, increasing
the electrolyte concentration in increments of 25 mM. The half-wave
potentials, E(1/2), were determined from
the midpoints between the cathodic and anodic peak potentials for
reversible or quasireversible voltammograms and from the inflection
points of the waves for irreversible oxidation and reduction. The
anodic and cathodic peak potentials, Ea and Ec, respectively, were determined
from the zeros of the first derivatives of the voltammograms, i.e.,
as the potentials at which ∂I/∂E = 0 when ∂E/∂t = constant. The inflection points were determined from the zeros
of the second derivatives of the voltammograms, ∂2I/∂E2 = 0 at
∂E/∂t = constant.81,94 The second derivatives of the reversible and quasireversible voltammograms
indicated that the inflection-point potentials were quite close to
the midpoints between Ea and Ec, ensuring the reliability for the estimates of E(1/2) from the inflection points of the irreversible
voltammograms. The voltammograms were recorded at a scan rate of 100
mV s–1. To correct for potential drifts in the reference
electrode (SCE, connected to the cell via a salt bridge), ferrocene
was used as a standard (E(1/2) = 0.45
± 0.01 V vs SCE for MeCN, 100 mM NBu4BF4).82 Voltammograms of the standard were
recorded before and after each set of measurements. To correct for
the dependence of E(1/2) on the electrolyte
concentration, the potentials in neat electrolyte-free solvent were
estimated from extrapolations to zero supporting electrolyte concentration
(Figure 2b).82,83

5.4 Computational Analysis
The pyrene
derivatives (Chart 1) were modeled using density functional theory (DFT). For simplicity,
the aliphatic chains were truncated to two carbons, i.e., to ethyl
groups (Figure 3).
The DFT calculations were performed at the at the B3LYP/6-311G(3df,3dp)
level of theory for the formamide and at the B3LYP/6-311+G(d,p) level
of theory for the pyrene derivatives95−97 for the gas phase using
Gaussian 09.98 Although the calculations
for formamide are sensitive to the selection of basis set, the results
for the pyrene derivatives were practically the same for the different
levels of theory tested (see Supporting Information). On the basis of Koopman’s theorem, we estimate IE and EA
from the energies of the radical-ion doublet states and the ground
states. Spin-unrestricted calculations are used for the calculations
of the radical-cation and radical-anion doublet states. Solvent effects
were estimated by comparing the results from gas-phase calculations
to those in an integral equation formalism polarizable continuum model
(PCM).99
