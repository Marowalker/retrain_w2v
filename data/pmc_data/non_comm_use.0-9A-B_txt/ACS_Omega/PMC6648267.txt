A reaction between
sodium 2-formylbenzenesulfonate and aniline revealed the near-quantitative
(91%) formation of sodium-2-((phenylimino)methyl)benzenesulfonate L1. The identity of L1 was unambiguously ascertained
using spectroscopic and analytical methods. The scope of this methodology
was widened and various electron-donating amines were treated with
sodium 2-formylbenzenesulfonate, and a small library of 6 imine ligands L2–L6 was generated. When L2 was treated
with [(COD)PdMeCl], instead of the anticipated [L2PdMe(DMSO)]
complex, the formation of [(DMSO)2Pd2Cl2Me2] Pd-Dim was observed. Nevertheless,
the desired imino-methyl benzenesulfonate-ligated palladium complex
[L2PdMe(Lu)] C1 was obtained by in situ
abstraction of chloride and addition of bulky 2,6-lutidine as the
donor group. The observation of characteristic Pd–Me protons
at 0.06 ppm and the corresponding carbon at −8.1 ppm indicated
the formation of C1. These 1D NMR observations were corroborated
by 2D C–H correlation spectra and mass analysis, and the existence
of C1 was unambiguously ascertained. Along the same lines, L4 and L5 were treated with a palladium precursor
to produce [L4/5PdMe(Lu)]-type complexes C2–C3 in 55–84% yield, and their identity was established by using
a combination of spectroscopic tools, analytical methods, and single-crystal
X-ray diffraction. The synthetic utility of C1–C3 has been demonstrated by utilizing these complexes in the insertion
polymerization of ethylene to polyethylene.

Introduction
Insertion
polymerization of olefins to the corresponding polyolefins is known
for several decades, and the world today produces about 180 million
tons of polyolefins every year using the well-known Ziegler–Natta
(ZN) process.1−4 The deep understanding of the classical ZN-type catalysts inspired
academics to develop homogeneous congeners for olefin polymerization
and olefin copolymerization with functional groups.5−7 The late metal
α-diimine Ni or Pd catalysts developed by Brookhart produce
highly branched polyethylene.8 Detailed
investigations reveal that α-diimine Ni or Pd catalysts are
susceptible to chain-walking, a phenomenon that yields highly branched
polyethylene.9,10 However, recent modification
to the famous α-diimine Brookhart system has enabled the polymerization
of ethylene to high-molecular-weight polyethylene.11 Along the same lines, late transition metal complexes of
phenoxy-imine ligands, such as 1 (Figure 1), are known to produce polyethylene with
high molecular weight.12

Figure 1 Designing features of
imino-methyl-benzenesulfonate-ligated palladium complexes.

Lately, Drent introduced an ortho-phosphinebenzenesulfonate-ligated palladium complex of type 2,13 which is capable of producing
very high molecular weight polyethylene14 and tolerates various functional groups.15−34 Subsequent to this discovery, Nozaki and co-workers introduced an
carbene-quinoline-ligated palladium complex.35 These complexes have been evaluated in the insertion polymerization
of olefins and lead to the production of polyolefins.36 As evident from the above discussion, ligand designing
has been at the crux of olefin polymerization, and various generations
of catalysts, such as metallocenes, postmetallocenes and so forth,
have been developed.37,38 Given the performance of phenoxy-imine
and ortho-phosphinebenzenesulfonate ligand systems
in ethylene polymerization, we pondered if we can blend the features
of 1 and 2 and construct a ligand system
that would be a fusion of these two ligands. Thus, we envisioned a
bidentate ligand with imine as a strong σ-donor (extracted feature
of 1), sulfonate as a weak σ-donor (as is the case
of 2), and a rigid backbone of aromatic ring (a feature
common to 1 and 2). However, our initial
attempts to synthesize imine sulfonate (Figure 1, top) by treating aromatic aldehydes with
acid-substituted amines led to the generation of benzoxazinones.39

Herein we report a single-step synthesis
of a small library of six imino-methyl benzenesulfonate ligands L1–L6 and their complexation with palladium to yield
neutral alkyl–palladium(II) complexes C1–C3. The identity of six ligands and three complexes has been unambiguously
ascertained using a combination of spectroscopic and analytical methods.
Finally, the synthetic utility of the imino-methyl benzenesulfonate-ligated
palladium complex has been demonstrated by employing C1–C3 in an ethylene polymerization reaction.

Results and Discussion
Syntheses
of Ligands L1–L6
We have recently discovered
that a condensation reaction between various amino-benzoic acids and
aldehydes yields benzoxazinones in the presence of an acidic-substituent
ortho to the amine.39 Therefore, we hypothesized
that if we can trap this acidic proton or substitute it with a heavy
metal cation, we might be able to access imines. Thus, the amino acids
were converted to their sodium salts and were used to demonstrate
that, indeed, if the crucial acidic proton is replaced by a heavy
metal cation, the formation of benzoxazinone is suppressed, whereas
imine formation is favored.

Sodium 2-formylbenzenesulfonate
was treated with a simple amine, such as aniline, in dimethyl formamide
(DMF), and the reaction mixture was refluxed for 6 h. Subsequent work-up
and the evaporation of volatiles afforded the anticipated imine-sulfonate
ligand L1 (Scheme 1) in 91% isolated yield. A proton NMR of the above solid revealed
a characteristic singlet at 9.50 ppm (Figure S1), which can be easily assigned to the imine C–H proton. The
proton NMR findings were supported by 13C NMR, which revealed
an imine carbon at 161.2 ppm. Furthermore, the existence of L1 was unambiguously ascertained using a combination of 1-2D
NMR spectroscopy, and cross peaks confirmed the presence of L1. An IR of L1 revealed the presence of an imine
CN band at 1621 cm–1. The NMR and IR findings were
corroborated by high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) analysis,
which revealed a molecular ion peak at m/z = 284.0350 Da. This observed mass exactly matches with
the calculated mass of 284.0352 Da.

Scheme 1 Synthesis of Sodium-2-(((phenyl)imino)methyl)benzenesulfonate
(L1) and a Small Library of Imine-Sulfonate Ligands L2–L6
Various electron-donating amine precursors were treated
with the sodium salt of benzenesulfonate, and the effect of the nature
of electron-donating substituents and steric crowding on imine formation
was investigated. As evident from Scheme 1, the reaction is quite tolerant to electron-rich
amines. Thus, a reaction of sodium 2-formylbenzenesulfonate and 4-methoxy
aniline in DMF at 150 °C yielded sodium-2-(((4-methoxyphenyl)imino)methyl)benzenesulfonate
(L2) in 80% isolated yield. A characteristic imine proton
was observed at 9.38 ppm (Table 1), whereas the corresponding carbon appeared at 161.2
ppm (Table 1). The
NMR findings were corroborated by HRMS, which revealed a molecular
ion peak at m/z = 314.0453, which
exactly matches with the simulated mass. Thus, the anticipated imine
ligand L2 could be easily prepared, although with slightly
lower yields as compared to L1.

c The HRMS data are for ligands L1–L6. ND: Not determined.

After
having established a robust protocol to prepare imines L1 and L2, we embarked on widening the scope and electron-rich
and sterically demanding imines; sodium-2-(((2-methoxyphenyl)imino)methyl)benzenesulfonate L3, sodium-2-(((2,6-diisopropylphenyl)imino)methyl)benzenesulfonate L4, sodium-2-((tert-butylimino)methyl)benzenesulfonate L5, and sodium (2-(((3s,5s,7s)adamantan-1-yl)imino)methyl)benzenesulfonate L6 were prepared in good to excellent yield. The identity
of these imine ligands was unambiguously established by NMR and mass
analysis. Table 1 provides
a glance of characteristic 1H, 13C chemical
shifts and HRMS data and demonstrates the existence of L1–L6. The effect of electron-donating substituents is clearly visible
from the imine proton chemical shift. As one moves from simple aniline
(L1) to more electron-rich di-isopropyl-substituted L4, the imine proton shifts up-field from 9.50 (L1) to 9.08 (L4) ppm. A similar electronic effect was
observed for L5 and L6. Thus, electron-donating
and sterically bulky amines were found to condense with sodium salt
of 2-formyl benzenesulfonate to yield electron-rich imine ligands L1 to L6 in excellent yields.

Palladium Complexes
of L2, L4, and L5
Neutral, palladium(II) complexes of phosphine-sulfonate ligands are
known to play a decisive role in obtaining high-molecular-weight polyethylene.14,40 In our attempts to synthesize neutral palladium(II) complexes, two
types of metal precursors were employed, namely, [(COD)PdMeCl] and
[Pd(Lu)2MeCl].

Treatment of L2 with
[(COD)PdMeCl] in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) produced a brown-colored
residue after the evaporation of volatiles.41 A proton NMR of this residue revealed a singlet at 0.95 ppm that
can be tentatively assigned to “Pd–Me” species.
However, the chemical shift for such hetero-bidentate-ligated Pd–Me
species is usually further up-field in the region of 0.5–0.02
ppm. However, Pd–Me around 1 ppm is observed for neutrally
coordinated ligands, such as TMEDA,42 and
the palladium methyl protons for [(TMEDA)PdMeCl] appear at 1.02 ppm.43 A careful evaluation of the 1-2D NMR data indicated
that a dimeric palladium complex of type Pd-dim (Scheme 2, top) could have
been formed, without the iminesulfonate ligand L2. To
confirm this further, on-purpose synthesis of Pd-Dim was
undertaken. [(COD)PdMeCl] was dissolved in 1 mL DMSO at room temperature
and stirred for 2 h. As evident from Figure 2 (bottom), the proton NMR of this complex
revealed a singlet at 0.95 ppm, which exactly overlaps with the earlier
spectrum recorded for L2, [(COD)PdMeCl] reaction (Figure 2 top). A single-crystal
X-ray diffraction of the above “on purpose” prepared
complex demonstrated the formation of a dimer of type Pd-Dim, with 2 palladium atoms, 2 chlorides, 2 methyl groups, and 2 palladium-coordinated
DMSO molecules per unit complex. Figure 3 depicts the molecular structure of Pd-Dim. The Pd-Dim crystalizes in a monoclinic
unit cell and P21/n space
group. The two chlorides bridge the two palladium centers with a Pd1a–Cl1
and Pd1–Cl1a bond length of 2.47 Å, whereas the covalently
bonded Pd–Cl bond length was found to be 2.36 Å (Figure 3). The observed Pd–Cl
bond length is in line with the reported Pd–Cl bond lengths.44

mixture of L2 and [(COD)PdMeCl] (top) and on-purpose
prepared Pd-Dim (bottom).

Scheme 2 Coordination Behaviour of L2 (Top) and Synthesis
of Palladium Precursor Pd–Lu2 (Bottom)
However, such chloride-bridged
dimers are relatively less reactive, and the formation of monometallic
complexes from chloride-bridged dimers is an uphill task.45,46 We then choose to adopt two approaches: (1) in situ abstraction
of chloride before the complexation of ligand and (2) use of a bulky
donor solvent, such as 2,6-lutidine, which might disfavor dimerization
and might yield a mononuclear palladium complex. Thus, [(COD)PdMeCl]
was treated with 2,6-lutidine in 5 mL dichloromethane (DCM) at room
temperature.47 Work-up followed by drying
under vacuum produced Pd-Lu2 (Scheme 2 bottom) in 97% yield.
The formation of Pd-Lu2 was confirmed
by 1H NMR, which revealed Pd–Me protons at 0.20
ppm, and the corresponding coordinated lutidine protons appeared at
3.36 ppm.

After having prepared the suitable palladium precursor Pd-Lu2 we set out to investigate the
coordination behavior of L2, L4, and L5. In the in situ approach, [(COD)PdMeCl] was treated with
a stoichiometric amount of AgBF4 in DCM and the mixture
was stirred at room temperature for 2 h. After 2 h, sodium-2-(((4-methoxyphenyl)imino)methyl)
benzenesulfonate (L2) was added to the above mixture
and the content was stirred for 15 min, which was followed by the
addition of 44 μL of 2,6-lutidine (Lu). Work-up and drying produced
the palladium complex [L2PdMeLu] C1 in 56%
isolated yield (Scheme 3 top). A proton NMR of this solid revealed a characteristic imine
proton at 8.91 ppm, indicating the coordination of imine-nitrogen
to the palladium center. The 1H NMR findings were further
corroborated by 13C NMR (Figure S36), in which the imine carbon appeared much down-field at 169.7 ppm.
Furthermore, the palladium methyl protons, which were the bone of
contention in the earlier part, now appeared at 0.06 ppm, whereas
the corresponding carbon appeared at −8.1 ppm. The 1D NMR observations
were authenticated by 2D NMR spectroscopy, and as is evident in Figure 4, the palladium methyl
proton at 0.06 ppm revealed a direct cross peak to the carbon at −8.1
ppm. Such an up-field shift for the Pd–Me group is in good
agreement with previously reported data for phosphinimine-ligated
palladium–methyl complexes.48 Furthermore,
the NMR findings were corroborated by an ESI-MS analysis, and a molecular
ion peak at m/z = 519.05 [M + H]+ Da was observed.

(HSQC) spectrum of C1 in CDCl3 (400 MHz).

Scheme 3 Synthesis of Palladium–Iminesulfonate
Complexes C1–C3
In the second approach, L4 was treated with
a mononuclear palladium precursor [PdLu2] at room temperature
to yield a palladium complex [L4PdMeLu] C2 in 84% isolated yields (Scheme 3 middle). The formation of the complex C2 was confirmed by 1H, 13C NMR (including DEPT),
IR, and mass spectrometric analysis. Thus, the hallmark Pd–Me
protons appeared at 0.09 ppm, whereas the corresponding carbon showed
up at −7.2 ppm. The ESI-MS analysis revealed a molecular ion
peak at m/z = 573.15 [M + H]+ Da, which can be assigned to complex C2.

However, a AgBF4 route was adapted to prepare [L5PdMeLu] C3 via in situ abstraction of chloride. The
formation of C3 was established through NMR, MS, and
IR spectroscopic analysis. The identity of C3 was unambiguously
ascertained through single-crystal X-ray diffraction (Figure 5). X-ray quality crystals were
obtained at −25 °C by layering the DCM solution of C3 with hexane. The complex crystalizes in the I41/a space group with a
distorted square planar palladium center. The nitrogen (imine)–palladium
bond distance of 2.05 Å (N1–Pd) authenticated a coordinate
bond, whereas sulfonate oxygen displayed a covalent bond distance
of 2.19 Å (O1–Pd) (Figure 5). Similar bond distances and bond angles have been
reported for palladium complexes derived from imine and sulfonate
ligands.22,23bTables S2–S4 summarize important crystal data, bond angles, and bond distances.49

Ethylene Polymerization
Neutral, palladium(II) complexes
are known to polymerize ethylene to polyethylene without any co-catalyst
or activator.50,51 Given the similar charge, chelation
effect, and oxidation state of the metal, it is anticipated that C1, C2, and C3 can potentially polymerize
ethylene to polyethylene. Just to demonstrate the potential of these
newly prepared complexes, we evaluated the performance of C1–C3 in ethylene polymerization, and Table 2 presents important results. Ethylene polymerization
was carried out in a Büchi high-pressure reactor that was charged
with 48 μmol of C1 in 5 mL DCM and 100 mL toluene.
Complex C1 failed to catalyze the polymerization of ethylene
at 40 °C (Table 2, entry 1). However, at 80 °C, the formation of polyethylene
material was observed.

f This entry is for complex 2 (R = Ar-OMe, L = pyridine)
presented in diagram 1 and is directly taken from ref (25).

Increasing the temperature to 95 °C at 5 bar
ethylene pressure produced 20 mg of polyethylene. Please note that
the yield is calculated based on the precipitated polyethylene and
the waxy material obtained after the evaporation of volatiles from
the polymerization reaction. Thus, the activity increases with increasing
temperature, and 95 °C appears to be the suitable temperature
for polymerization. The effect of ethylene pressure was investigated
at three different pressures, 5, 15, and 25 bars, and entries 3–5
report the findings. As evident, the highest activity was observed
at 25 bar ethylene pressure. The resultant polyethylene was characterized
by NMR, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight
mass spectrometry (MALDI-ToF-MS), and differential scanning colorimetry
(DSC). Interestingly, the MALDI-ToF-MS revealed that the palladium
catalyst is still bound to the polyethylene chain and the ethylene
repeat units could be clearly seen (Figure S51). The DSC thermogram (Figure S52) of
the precipitated polyethylene fraction displayed a melting temperature
of 125 °C. Along the same line, C2 and C3 were evaluated in ethylene polymerization under identical conditions
and were found to be less reactive than C1 (run 6–7
vs 4).

Complex 4 presented in Chart 1 is also known to produce polyethylene
(PE) without a cocatalyst.52 Unfortunately,
we could not come across any
literature report on ethylene polymerization using 4 under
identical conditions, but entry 8 in Table 2 presents the closest conditions to our investigations.
Catalyst 4 displayed better performance than C1, with a TOF of 0.10 (106 g of PE mol–1 of Ni h–1) at a lower pressure and temperature
(Table 2, entry 8).
However, under almost identical conditions (except that the L is pyridine),
catalyst 5 was found to be 20 times more active than C1 (Table 2, entry 9). The thus-prepared complexes C1–C3 are active in ethylene polymerization. However, compared to the
parent complexes 4 and 5, C1–C3 underperform. Steric and electronic tailoring along with donor group
change might potentially provide a better catalyst.

Conclusions
In summary, a reaction between sodium 2-formylbenzenesulfonate
and aniline revealed the near-quantitative (91%) formation of sodium-2-((phenylimino)methyl)
benzenesulfonate L1. A characteristic imine proton at
9.50 ppm and the corresponding carbon at 161.2 ppm authenticated the
formation of L1. Following a similar protocol, a small
library of six imine ligands L1–L6 was generated.
The coordination behavior of bidentate ligand L2 toward
[(COD)PdMeCl] was evaluated. Instead of the anticipated [L2-PdMe(DMSO)] complex, the formation of the unanticipated [(DMSO)2Pd2Cl2Me2] Pd-Dim was observed. However, in situ chloride abstraction followed by
the addition of [Pd(COD)MeCl] produced the desired imino-methyl benzenesulfonate-ligated
palladium complex [L2PdMeLu] C1. The existence
of C1 was unambiguously ascertained using a combination
of 1-2D C–H correlation NMR spectra, IR, and mass analysis.
In a second strategy, L4 was treated with a palladium
precursor Pd-Lu2 to produce [L4PdMeLu] C2 in 84% yield, and the identity of C2 was established by using a combination of spectroscopic
and analytical methods. Along the same lines, C3 was
prepared and its existence was demonstrated using a single-crystal
X-ray structure. The potential of the thus-prepared imino-methyl benzenesulfonate-ligated
palladium complexes was evaluated in ethylene polymerization, and C1–C3 were found to catalyze the insertion polymerization
of ethylene to polyethylene.

Ethylene Polymerization
Using C1–C3 as Catalysts
Ethylene polymerization
was carried out in a 250 mL stainless steel high-pressure Büchi
(Glas Uster cyclone 075) reactor equipped with a heating/cooling jacket
and mechanical stirrer. Prior to the experiment, the reactor was fully
dried by heating it in vacuum at 90 °C for 60 min, followed by
cooling it to room temperature and filling it with argon. After cooling
under argon, the reactor was flushed with ethylene (3 times, at the
desired pressure) and was charged with appropriate quantity of toluene
under positive ethylene pressure. The reactor was then pressurized
to the desired pressure and saturated with ethylene for 30 min at
the desired reaction temperature. After cooling to room temperature,
the solution of C1 (48 μmol in 2 mL DCM) was introduced
into the reactor at room temperature. The reactor was finally pressurized
to 5–25 bars of ethylene with stirring. The polymerization
was generally carried out for 2 h, the excess ethylene was slowly
vented off, and the reactor was allowed to cool down to room temperature.
A floating solid material was observed in the reactor, which was separated,
and the remaining solution was dried under reduced pressure at 50
°C for 8 h. The resultant waxy residue was weighed and characterized
by various methods (Figures S50–S52). Please note that the yield reported is a sum of precipitated polyethylene
and waxy polyethylene. Important polymerization experiments using C1–C3 are summarized in Table 2.
