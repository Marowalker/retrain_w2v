Plug-in
hybrid electrical vehicles (PHEVs) are generally considered
to be a cleaner alternative to conventional passenger cars. However,
there is still very limited information available regarding criteria
pollutant emissions from these vehicles. This paper shows, for the
first time, the emissions of criteria pollutants, unregulated pollutants,
and CO2 and also electric range from two very different
PHEVs, one Euro 6 parallel plug-in hybrid and one range-extended battery
electric vehicle (BEVx), applying the new world harmonized light-duty
test procedure at ambient temperatures equal to 23 and −7 °C.
The impact of using a cabin air heating system on vehicle electric
range and emissions at cold temperature has also been studied. Cold
ambient temperatures and, to a larger extent, the use of heating systems
have been shown to lead to a pronounced negative impact on emissions
and shorter electric ranges. Results also show that modern PHEVs can
emit similar, or even higher, levels of pollutants (e.g., particle
number) as Euro 6 conventional gasoline and diesel vehicles.

1 Introduction
Vehicle
exhaust emissions are of general concern as they are among
the main contributors to urban air pollution and to climate change.
Vehicles emit air pollutants such as NOx, volatile organic compounds
(VOCs), NH3, and fine particles1−3 and also greenhouse
gases (GHG)—mainly CO2, N2O, and CH4.4 Plug-in hybrid electrical vehicles
(PHEVs) (also known in the European Union (EU) as off-vehicle charge
hybrid electric vehicles—OVC-HEVs) are presented as a sustainable
mobility alternative to reduce the vehicle emissions. PHEVs are vehicles
equipped with an internal combustion engine (ICE), an electric motor,
and a rechargeable electric energy storage system (REESS) that can
be directly charged from the electric grid. PHEVs represent a technical
compromise between pure-electric vehicles (PEV) and the conventional
vehicles. They offer drivers the same range as conventional vehicles
while providing the environmental benefits of pure-electric vehicles
(PEVs), such as the absence of exhaust pollutant emissions during
electric operation and reduction of GHG emissions. Owing to these
features, PHEVs will be allowed to circulate in low-emission zones
that have been defined aiming at improving urban air quality.

Faria et al. have recently showed that GHG emissions would be substantially
reduced by PHEVs used under the present EU energy generation system.5 According to Plötz et al. (2017), these
vehicles could be charged using renewable electricity, and they are
seen as a proxy to meet the transport GHG reduction targets.6 Moreover, the possibility to lean on electrical
energy for transportation purposes limits the energy dependency on
fossil fuels, which is of extreme importance for the EU.7

The European Environmental Agency (EEA)
presents every year a comprehensive
emission inventory that includes vehicle emissions. This inventory
is often used for life-cycle assessments and model studies in the
EU, and yet, in the latest EEA emission inventory, there are no emissions
listed for PHEVs. The document states that they will have very low,
but nonzero, emission rates, and since the number of these vehicles
is currently very low, their emissions could be neglected for the
time being.

Previous works reported that hybrid electric vehicles
present enhanced
energy efficiency and lower pollutant emissions compared to conventional
vehicles,8,9 but we have recently reported that criteria
pollutant emissions from a Euro 5 PHEV can be similar to those measured
from conventional vehicles.10 Yuksel et
al.11 have recently shown that life-cycle
plug-in electric vehicle CO2 emissions depend on the assumed
electricity grid mix, driving patterns, and ambient temperature. Low
ambient temperature has been proven to reduce PHEVs’ and PEVs’
electrical range,11−14 to increase exhaust emissions from hybrid electric vehicles,8 and to reduce environmental benefits from PEVs
compared to conventional gasoline vehicles.15 Same as for conventional vehicles, PHEVs’ exhaust emissions
may be a concern during the winter season, which is already associated
with high pollution episodes.16,17

United Nations
Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) Regulation
10118 was used to test the hybrid electrical
vehicles until very recently. This procedure was heavily criticized
for its favorable testing assumptions for PHEVs since it was not representative
of real-world operations. That procedure has been replaced by the
world harmonized light-duty test procedure (WLTP).19 The WLTP, developed to be more representative of real-world
driving conditions than the former type-approval, has been used for
type-approval of light-duty vehicles (LDVs) in the European Union
since September 2017.19 Since PHEVs are
gradually taking over a large fraction of the global vehicle market,20 and they are considered to be a cleaner alternative
to conventional gasoline and diesel passenger cars, it is of major
importance to evaluate their emissions to be able to anticipate their
impact and share in the total emissions from the transport sector.

In this context, we have studied two modern PHEVs applying the
WLTP. The vehicles presented two different architectures, one parallel—which
uses both ICE and electric motor to propel the vehicle—and
one series—which uses an auxiliary power unit (APU) as generator,
supplying electricity to the electric engine, which provides the energy
needed to propel the vehicle. We also have evaluated how other real-world
conditions, such as the cold ambient temperature and the use of air
heating system, can impact the emissions and electric range. In this
work, we aim at highlighting the importance of the emissions of regulated
(total hydrocarbons (THC), NOx, CO, particle number (PN)) and nonregulated
(NH3 and N2O) pollutants from PHEVs in comparison
to conventional vehicles, as well as the strong negative effect that
cold ambient temperature can have on PHEV’s emissions and vehicle
electric range.

2 Experimental Section
2.1 Test Vehicles
Two gasoline PHEVs,
one Euro 6 with parallel configuration (hereinafter PHEV) and one
US range-extended battery electric vehicle (BEVx) equipped with a
range extending APU (hereinafter BEVx), were tested on a chassis dynamometer
in the Vehicle Emission Laboratories (VELAs) at the European Commission
Joint Research Centre (EC-JRC) Ispra, Italy.

The PHEV was a
European Euro 6a vehicle type-approved under Regulation 101 using
the New European Driving Cycle (NEDC). The vehicle was equipped with
a Li-ion battery with a capacity of 25 Ah and a nominal voltage of
345 V. PHEV had a 1.4 l.—110 kW gasoline engine. BEVx was a
U.S. type-approved BEVx vehicle fitted with a Li-ion battery pack
with a capacity of 60 Ah and a nominal voltage of 360 V. BEVx had
a 0.65 l.—25 kW gasoline engine. Details of the tested vehicles
are summarized in Table S1 (Supporting
Information).

It should be noted that in the EU, a BEVx is considered,
and tested,
as any other OVC-HEV. However, according to the USA legislation, it
falls under a different category than parallel PHEVs (i.e., OVC-HEV),
namely, the BEVx category of the zero-emission vehicles.

2.2 Test Procedures
Emissions of regulated
pollutants, ammonia (NH3) and nitrous oxide (N2O), as well as the vehicle electric range were studied at 23 °C
and −7 °C. These temperatures were selected because 23
°C is the reference temperature used during the Type 1 test
of the emission type-approval of LDVs in Europe, and −7 °C
is the temperature used during the cold temperature procedure in different
regions of the world (EU, USA, Korea, China).21−24 Low temperature emission type-approval
testing in EU (also known as Type 6 test) is performed without the
use of the air heating system. However, to be more representative
of the real use, the vehicles were also studied, during a second series
of cold ambient temperature test (−7 °C), using the air
conditioning system turned on and set at 21 °C (hereinafter −7
°C Aux-ON) as done by US EPA during the cold temperature vehicle
testing.24

Figure S1 illustrates the experimental setup for the measurement of
gaseous emissions and solid particle number (SPN). Regulated gaseous
emissions were analyzed by sampling diluted exhaust from a set of
Tedlar bags using an integrated system (MEXA-7400HTR-LE, HORIBA) equipped
with a nondispersive infrared for CO and CO2, a chemiluminescence
for NOx, and a heated (191 °C) flame ionization detector for
total hydrocarbons (THC). A solid particle number (SPN) measurement
system (AVL APC 489), with particle diameter cut-off of 23 nm (d50% = 23), compliant with the light-duty vehicles
Regulation 83,25 was used at the CVS to
measure SPN (hereinafter PN). NH3 and N2O (unregulated
pollutants) emissions were monitored from the raw exhaust using a
high-resolution Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (FTIR; MKS
2030-HS). Further details on the performance during the real-time
measurement on transient cycles using FTIR and emission factor calculations
can be found in Suarez-Bertoa et al. (2014; 2015; 2017).26−28 Calculations of the uncertainties of the measured pollutants were
performed as described in Giechaskiel et al. (2012) and Giechaskiel
et al. (2018).29,30 Real-time battery voltage and
current were measured using a power analyzer (HIOKI 3390) and a data
logger connected to the vehicle’s engine control unit (ECU). Figures S2 and S3 illustrate the setup used to
perform these measurements for PHEV and BEVx.

Vehicles were
tested following option 3 of the test sequence for
OVC-HEV described in Annex 8 of GTR-15.31 A simplified scheme is shown in Figure 1. Hence, vehicles were tested in two different
operation modes: (i) charge-depleting mode (CD), where the vehicle
is tested in full electric operation, similar to a PEV; and (ii) charge-sustaining
(CS) mode, where the ICE provides the energy that moves the vehicle
and maintains a certain level of battery state of charge (SOC). CD
testing comprises a number of WLTP tests carried out with a fully
charged battery until break-off criterion (relative electric energy
change (REEC) < 0.04) is reached (see GTR-15).31 Once break-off criterion has been reached, the confirmation
cycle starts and the vehicle is ready and preconditioned for the CS
testing. CS test is a test performed following the procedures used
for the conventional vehicles at cold-start conditions. During CD
testing, the PHEV needed two worldwide harmonized light duty test
cycle (WLTC) tests to reach the break-off criterion at 23 and −7
°C, and just one WLTC at −7 °C using the auxiliary
systems (−7 °C Aux-ON). The BEVx needed six WLTC tests
at 23 °C, five WLTC tests at −7 °C, and four WLTC
at −7 °C using the auxiliary systems (−7 °C
Aux-ON). Once the vehicles reached break-off criteria and the confirmation
cycle was performed, they were soaked overnight at the required temperature.
Then, they were tested in CS mode as prescribed in GTR-15.

Figure 1 Test sequence
for OVC-HEVs according to option 3, including charge-depleting
(CD) and charge-sustaining (CS) type 1 tests, as described in Annex
8-Appendix 1 of GTR-15.

To derive the CO2 correction coefficients and
correct
CS CO2 emissions to a neutral battery SOC level, five warm
start CS tests were carried out with the same soaking time between
them (30 min), as foreseen in the WLTP. Final vehicle emissions (also
called weighted emissions) and electric range are calculated weighting
the CD and CS operations (see eq 1 or refer to Annex 8 of GTR-15). To this aim, the so-called
utility factors (UFs), which represent the ratio of the distance covered
in the CD (electric) mode to the total distance covered between two
subsequent charges, are used. 1  where Mi,weighted is the utility factor-weighted mass emission of compound i (g/km),
UFj is the utility factor of WLTP’s
CD phase j, Mi,CD,j is the pollutant mass emission of CD phase j (g/km), and Mi,CS is the charge-sustaining
mass emission of gaseous emission compound i for the charge-sustaining
Type 1 test (g/km). CD emissions of each phase j of
the WLTP test (low, medium, high, and extra-high) have different weightings
for the final CD emissions and will also weight differently if the
WLTP test is the first or last in the CD sequence. Since phase-utility
factors (UFj) decrease with increase in
the number of WLTP tests in the CD mode, the final CD emissions will
decrease as the electric range increases. It should be noticed that
before the introduction of the WLTP, NEDC CD emissions of CO2 would equal 0 g/km if electric range of a vehicle was longer than
1 NEDC cycle (∼11 km).

3 Results
and Discussion
A summary of the tests performed at the three
studied conditions
(i.e., 23, −7, and −7 °C Aux-ON) is illustrated
in Figures 2 and 3 for PHEV and BEVx, respectively. Figure 3 shows that PHEV’s ICE
started working during the extra-high phase of the 1st cycle when
the vehicle reached 130 km/h. However, PHEV was still capable of running
in pure-electric mode for most part of the 2nd WLTC cycle. This particular
behavior was discussed in a previous work.32 There it was indicated that the energy management system of the
vehicle may have been optimized for the NEDC, where the vehicle speed
does not exceed 130 km/h. If the vehicle is prepared for the testing
under the WLTP, the combustion engine will not turn on during the
first WLTC cycle and the electric ranges of this vehicle would be
higher than the ranges shown in the next section (Table 1). A similar situation was seen
when the vehicle was tested at −7 °C. During the test
performed at −7 °C using the heating system, the battery
was depleted much faster. In fact, ICE started before reaching the
high-speed section of the extra-high phase of the 1st cycle. Hence,
break-off criterion was met after just one WLTC.

3.1 Electric
Range and Electric Energy Consumption
Table 1 summarizes
the electric ranges and electric energy consumption of PHEV and BEVx
at three studied conditions (i.e., 23, −7, and −7 °C
Aux-ON). All electric range (AER) is the distance traveled in pure-electric
mode until the point when the ICE is turning on for the first time.
AERcity is the electric range expected during the city
driving only (low and medium speed phase of the WLTC). Weighted electric
energy consumption (EEC weighed in Wh/km) is the total UF-weighted
consumption where both driving modes (pure electric and hybrid) are
considered. All these results, from tests done at 23 °C, must
be communicated to the user through the vehicle’s Certificate
of Conformity (CoC). Table 1 also shows the values for UF-weighted electric energy
consumption of the CD mode only (EEC CD) that is calculated and recorded
during the vehicle’s type-approval process, but not reported
to the user in CoC.

BEVx has a higher C/M ratio (REESS capacity
to vehicle Kerb mass ratio) compared to the PHEV, and hence, BEVx
electric ranges were significantly higher than that of PHEV at all
studied conditions. In good agreement with what was reported in previous
studies,11,15 electric ranges (AERs) dropped at low ambient
temperatures and even more when the heating was used during testing.
The BEVx’s AER dropped from ∼124 km at 23 °C to
∼74 km at −7 °C (∼40%), and PHEV’s
AER dropped from ∼20 km at 23 °C to ∼15 km at −7
°C (∼25%) when the air heating system was used. Higher
autonomy can be achieved when driving in city conditions (AERcity) compared to driving at higher speeds (high and extra-high
speed phases) of the WLTC that represent the typical extraurban and
highway conditions.

As a result of testing these vehicles at
low ambient temperatures
(−7 °C) and the use of heating, the electric energy consumption
increased compared to the standard test conditions at 23 °C.
In addition, the BEVx has a higher overall EEC weighed per km compared
to the PHEV. Different results can be explained by the facts that
EEC weighed is calculated by the formula where only 52% for PHEV and
even 94% for BEVx of the CD EEC is considered for the overall contribution
in the EEC (the remaining time the vehicles spend in CS modes). In
addition, and since for the calculation of EEC weighed the number
of CD tests is important, some numbers in Table 1 can be misleading to consumers, for example,
lower values for −7 °C tests when the heating system was
on compared to the values at −7 °C when the heating system
was off. The EEC CD is a better parameter to compare the vehicle’s
electric energy consumption at different temperatures and with different
electric loads. In addition, the EEC CD was higher for PHEV compared
to the BEVx, and it closer depicts the conditions that a user can
expect in terms of energy consumption when driving in pure-electric
mode.

3.2 CO2 Emissions
Final emissions
of CO2 electrified vehicles are related not only to ICE
size and performance, but also to the vehicle’s electric range:
high electric range is associated with lower CO2 emissions
(Tables 2, S2, and S3). Hence, PHEV presenting a lower electric
range resulted in overall CO2 emissions 5–7 times
higher than BEVx.

Aux-ON refers
to tests performed at −7 °C ambient temperature using
the vehicle’s air conditioning system turned on and set at
21 °C.

As a consequence
of UF-weighted calculation specified in the WLTP,
the CD CO2 emissions of PHEV were 8–27 times higher
than BEVx CD CO2 emissions at three different conditions
(Table S2). CS CO2 emissions
were, as expected, higher for PHEV due to higher engine displacement
and kerb mass. The only exception was found for CS tests at −7
°C (Table S3) using the heating system,
where the CS CO2 emissions of the BEVx were higher than
the PHEV CS CO2 emissions, suggesting a higher energy demand
from the heating system in the case of the BEVx than for the PHEV.
Moreover, under the WLTP procedure, the vehicle manufacturer has the
possibility to correct the CS CO2 emissions for the difference
of the SOC of the battery between the start and end of the CS test.
The PHEV CS CO2 test with heating at −7 °C,
which allowed this correction, resulted in a reduction of 31 gCO2/km on the CS emissions initially measured (222 g/km). In
the case of the BEVx CS CO2 test with heating at −7
°C, the same correction resulted in reduction of 11 gCO2/km on the CS emissions initially measured (217 g/km).

CO2 emissions were strongly affected by the ambient
temperature, which is in line with what was reported by Yuksel et
al. (2016) and references therein.11 In
fact, the overall CO2 emissions were, respectively, 30
and 61% higher for the PHEV and the BEVx at −7 °C than
at 23 °C. This is partially due to the higher CO2 emissions
produced during the CS test at cold temperature but also because the
pure-electric operation is shorter at −7 °C and therefore
CD emissions were higher and CS emissions weigh more in the overall
CO2 emissions.

CO2 emissions from the
PHEV and the BEVx were, respectively,
72 and 209% higher when vehicles were tested at −7 °C
and keeping the heating system on. Hence, the extra request of energy
from the heating system led to a faster power consumption and consequently
to the shorter pure-electric time operation.

CO2 emissions
from the PHEV were 3 times higher than
those reported for a power split plug-in hybrid (AER ∼83 km)34 and 2 times higher than those for a series plug-in
hybrid, both tested under similar conditions (23 °C using WLTP).
The BEVx’s CO2 emissions were half of those reported
by Badin et al.34 These results indicate
that a wide variety of OVC-HEVs is available and their electric range
will be associated with the CO2 that they will emit. The
CO2 final emissions from the PHEV and the BEVx were, respectively,
40% and 90% lower than the best performing Euro 6 conventional vehicle
reported in a previous work.33 The difference
is even larger if only CD operation is taken into consideration. On
the other hand, if only CS emissions were to be compared, CO2 emissions from both vehicles were similar to what is reported in
the literature for Euro 6 conventional vehicles.33

In this work, EU UFs have been used as prescribed
by GTR-15. Plötz
et al.6 have shown that the real-world
PHEV’s CO2 emissions and electric ranges can differ
widely among users. They suggested that the main factors explaining
this variation are the annual mileage, the regularity of daily driving,
and the likelihood of long-distance trips. As Badin et al. recently
reported,34 higher emission factor would
be expected if U.S. UFs are used in our study. As reported in WLTP
regulation, once a significant number of PHEVs will be on the market,
UF factors will have to be modified to be able to better capture their
real usage and coherently assign the correct weighting to the values
of CO2 production.

The reported CO2 emission
factors refer to tailpipe
emissions. These emissions are those declared by the manufacturers
for the CO2 fleet calculation and also used as information
to the costumer. Hence, this approach does not reflect the emissions
associated with the life cycle of the vehicle. A comprehensive comparison
of emissions across vehicle types would be needed to account for the
full life cycle, including emissions from power plants.

3.3 Regulated and Unregulated Emissions
Tables 2, S2, and S3 summarize the regulated and unregulated
emission factors from the PHEV and the BEVx at all studied conditions
(i.e., 23, −7, and −7 °C Aux-ON). Regulated emissions
(with the exception of CO) and unregulated emissions were substantially
higher for the PHEV vehicle with the lower C/M ratio than for the
BEVx. CO emissions were higher for the BEVx in most cases (see Table 2).

Pollutant
emissions disproportionally increased for the two studied vehicles
as the ambient temperature decreased from 23 to −7 °C
(see Figures 3 and 4). This behavior is similar to that previously reported
for conventional vehicles.33,34 To give an example,
NOx-weighted combined emissions (i.e., UF-weighted CD + CS emissions)
from PHEV were 7 times higher at −7 °C than at 23 °C.
These differences were even larger when the vehicle’s air heating
system was used during the cold temperature tests (see Figures 3 and 4). Therefore, high pollutant emissions are expected from this type
of vehicles under real driving conditions at cold ambient temperatures.

calculated weighing CD and CS using EU utility factors as described
in GTR-15 at 23, −7, and −7 °C ambient temperature
using the vehicle’s air conditioning system turned on and set
at 21 °C (−7 °C Aux-ON). (Right panel) Average PN
emissions from conventional Euro 6 diesel and gasoline vehicles extracted
from Suarez-Bertoa et al. (2017) compared to PHEV-weighted emissions
at 23 °C (bottom-left panel) and −7 °C (bottom-right
panel). In the case of diesel and gasoline vehicles, error bars represent
the standard deviation of the values reported for the studied vehicles.
PHEV’s error bars represent the emission factor calculated
from either the CD or CS tests.

Plötz et al. recently reported6 that a series of popular PHEVs are driven using exclusively the
ICE for 22–61% of their operation time, which indicates that
pure CS operation is not uncommon among PHEV drivers. The PHEV presented
slightly higher pollutant emissions during CS (i.e., the vehicle uses
the ICE, burning fuel, during most of the test) than during CD operation
(i.e., the vehicle uses ICE during a fraction of the test sequence).
The BEVx, on the other hand, presented substantially higher emissions
during CS operation at all studied conditions (see Figure 3). During CS operation, the
PHEV emissions were, under all studied conditions, higher than those
measured from the BEVx, with CO emissions being an exception.

The different emissions between the PHEV and the BEVx were, besides
CO, mainly related to their corresponding electric ranges. The PHEV’s
electric range was relatively short (20 km); therefore, the weighting
factor (UF) has less influence on the calculated CD emissions than
in the case of long electric ranges. As a consequence, the PHEV’s
CD emissions were similar to those measured during the CS operation.
The BEVx’s electric range was considerably long, and for that
reason, CD emissions were low. CS emissions are those obtained from
a standard WLTP test with cold start, with the exception of CO2 emissions, which can be corrected applying the procedure
mentioned in the Experimental Section.

Since the PHEV’s ICE started before the battery charge was
depleted, the CO2 emissions and range from the PHEV could
be calculated considering a scenario where the ICE starts after ∼40
km as shown by Pavlovic et al.32 However,
this approach cannot be applied to the other pollutants because the
catalytic converter (and the engine) heats up when the ICE first started
and the time elapsed until the second ICE ignition (that took place
when the battery is actually depleted) was not enough to cool down
the systems and again reach cold-start conditions. This scenario was
more pronounced at cold temperature where the vehicle’s engine
temperature was 21 °C (instead of −7 °C cold start)
when the ICE ignited during the second WLTC of the CD procedure.

BEVx presented very low emissions for most pollutants at all studied
conditions (i.e., 23, −7, and −7 °C Aux-ON). Only
BEVx’s CO emissions were similar to those measured from PHEV
and other conventional gasoline vehicles33 (see Figure 5). The
high energy demand during the highest speeds of the extra-high phase
to the underdimensioned APU (650 cm3 and 25 kW) could have
led to the high CO emissions measured. At cold ambient temperature,
the emissions during CS operation (vehicle uses the APU to charge
a battery that is running low) were non-negligible. In fact, NOx emissions
from BEVx during CS were comparable to those reported for conventional
gasoline vehicles tested under similar conditions.33 As previously indicated, it has been estimated that plug-in
hybrids use up to 61% of their operation time in CS mode.6 Hence, emissions from vehicles presenting a similar
architecture should not be neglected in inventories and models.

vehicles extracted from Suarez-Bertoa et al. (2018) compared to PHEV-
and BEVx-weighted emissions at 23 °C (left panel) and −7

error bars represent the standard deviation of the values reported
for the studied vehicles. PHEV’s and BEVx’s error bars
represent the emission factor calculated from either CD or CS tests.
Diesel NOx emission factors are divided by 10 at the two temperatures.

PN emissions were measured for
the PHEV (see the Experimental Section).
Overall, the PHEV’s PN emissions
at 23 °C (1.2 × 1012 #/km) were above the values
set for type-approval of Euro 6 vehicles (6 × 1011 #/km) using the NEDC (Table S1). PN emissions
were 4 times higher (4.4 × 1012 #/km) during the tests
at cold ambient temperature and 6 times higher (6.4 × 1012 #/km) when using the air heating system at −7 °C
than those measured at 23 °C (1.2 × 1012 #/km)
(Figure 2). Negative
effects of cold ambient temperature on PN emissions from conventional
gasoline vehicles have recently been reported.33,36 Overall, PN emissions from the PHEV were similar to those reported
from conventional gasoline vehicles and several orders of magnitude
higher than those reported for modern (diesel particulate filter (DPF)-equipped)
diesel vehicles (Figure 2).

The gaseous weighted emission factors from the PHEV were
comparable
to those previously reported33 for a series
of Euro 6 conventional passenger cars tested following the WLTP at
23 and −7 °C (see Figure 5). Nonetheless, emissions of NOx and N2O
from conventional diesel vehicles and THCs from conventional gasoline
vehicles at −7 °C, reported in Suarez-Bertoa and Astorga
(2018), were higher than those from PHEV. On the other hand, THC,
CO, and NH3 emissions from the PHEV at −7 °C
were higher than those reported for diesel vehicles studied under
similar conditions by Suarez-Bertoa and Astorga (2018).33 Moreover, NOx emissions from the PHEV at −7
°C were 25% higher than the worse gasoline vehicle reported in
that study.33 Emission factors on the CS
mode were, in most cases, higher than the obtained weighted emission
factors (which also account for mileage in pure-electric driving).
It is then evident that if driven with a depleted battery, the PHEV
would result in even higher emissions compared to conventional vehicles.
As illustrated in Figures 3 and 4, cold ambient temperatures would
further exacerbate this difference.

Holland et al.15 have reported that
whereas gasoline-vehicle-related damages are large in Los Angeles
due to the large population and properties of the airshed, PEVs’
damages are small due to the clean Western US power grid, resulting
in substantial environmental benefits for the PEVs. However, due to
the prevalence of coal-fired generation and cold ambient temperatures,
PEVs’ damages are large in the upper Midwest. In their study,
Holland et al. do not integrate the effect of temperature on conventional
gasoline vehicles as they consider it to have a small effect. However,
it has been shown that emissions of CO2 and other pollutants
considered in Holland’s analysis dramatically increase at cold
ambient temperatures. We found that pollutant emissions of the studied
vehicles can be as high as those measured from gasoline vehicles at
23 and −7 °C and that at cold ambient temperature the
electric range reduction is in line with what Holland et al. considered
in their analysis for PEVs. Hence, it appears important to include
plug-in hybrid vehicles in this kind of holistic analysis as they
could play a negative role in the two areas described by Holland et
al., that is, a similar role to that of gasoline vehicles in Los Angeles,
and the role played by a combination of conventional gasoline and
PEV in the upper Midwest, having even higher negative impact in these
cold regions.

Recent studies reported that cold-start emissions
of VOCs, CO,
and NOx, often taking place during the first 30–60 s for modern
petrol vehicles,37 account for most of
the total emissions of conventional spark ignition vehicles.35 These emissions have also been reported to largely
increase at cold ambient temperatures.35,38,39 On the CS mode, the THC, CO, and NOx cold-start emissions
from PHEV were the main fraction of the total emissions at all the
studied conditions (see Figure 2). Furthermore, the cold-start emissions during the CD mode
were even higher than those registered during the CS mode. In fact,
total THC, NOx, and PN emissions reached approximately the same levels
during the few seconds that the ICE was used in the 1st CD cycle as
those produced during the entire CS cycle (see Figure S2).

Such high pollutant emissions may result
from the catalyst conditioning
strategy of the manufacturer (also known as “cat-heating”
event),40 which for this vehicle took place
during the extra-high speed phase of the 1st CD test. In the worst
case scenario, one could expect emissions to be similar to those observed
during a CS test as in both cases the ICE ignites from a cold-start
condition and with a cold catalytic converter. However, as illustrated
in Figure 2, ignition
of the ICE during high engine loads during the CD mode resulted in
disproportionally high emissions each time the ICE suddenly ignited
during transient operation. This effect was more accentuated at cold
ambient temperatures, where the pollutants that were emitted during
the few seconds of ICE operation of the 1st CD cycle were several
orders of magnitude higher than during the whole cold-start CS test.

These results put together highlight that in the few seconds of
ICE use, current plug-in hybrid vehicles could emit as many particles,
THC, and NOx as those emitted by Euro 6 conventional gasoline vehicles
during the cold-start or even during an entire WLTP test (23 km and
30 min long) and several times more if running in cold ambient temperatures.
Moreover, the PN emissions would be much larger than those typically
measured from modern (DPF-equipped) diesel vehicles.

The levels
of THC and NH3 emissions measured suggest
that vehicles like the PHEV will contribute as much as an average
conventional vehicle to the formation of atmospheric secondary organic
and inorganic aerosol.38,41 These secondary aerosols are
a major air-quality concern as they account for most of the PM found
in urban environments.42,43 Moreover, with the NOx emissions
measured, these vehicles do not appear to be a valid solution to reduce
urban NOx levels.
