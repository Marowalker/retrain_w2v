The manuscript revolves around an
interesting observation of solidification
of a solution of N-((1-((1-ethyl-1H-benzo[d]imidazol-2-yl)methyl)-1H-1,2,3-triazole-4-yl)methyl)aniline (A6) in the NMR
tube after around 12 h. Real-time images showed fibrillar and spherulitic
growth with tip branching and side branching, which is thermoreversible.
The compound under investigation is unique because it is synthesized
to understand the anticancer activity with two pharmacophores, benzimidazole
and triazole. Click chemistry is employed for in situ generation of
triazole moiety on benzimidazole. Previously, benzimidazole-based
compounds have shown self-aggregation-induced gel-like behavior because
of hydrogen bonding and/or π–π stacking interactions.
In the present case, NMR titrations with D2O addition showed
two distinct changes in the chemical shift for methylene bridges (connecting
benzimidazole and triazole ring) and ortho protons of the phenyl ring
(attached to triazole ring). Interestingly, a single-crystal X-ray
structure shows the absence of hydrogen bonds and π–π
stacking while in the presence of only two distinct close contacts,
completely correlating NMR data discussed in detail. A similar “molecular
origin” for self-aggregation is observed in seven other flexible
but regioisomeric compounds, which were designed and synthesized for
inducing hydrogen bonding through the removal of N-ethyl group and insertion of aniline and/or fluoro group.

==== Body
Introduction
Discovering small organic
molecules capable of forming gel is an
expanding research area due to their possible applications in tissue
engineering, drug delivery vehicles, and pollutant removal machineries.1−3 It has been noted that gel formation is closely related to molecular
self-assembly.4 The structure of self-aggregation
can be classified into primary, secondary, and tertiary structures
and depends on the complexity of the structure formation, like in
protein structure.1 The molecular gel is
believed to be formed solely with the help of noncovalent forces.
Thermoreversibility is the characteristic feature to distinguish the
molecular gels from the covalent force-mediated chemical gels.5 The fiber network structure can be described
by considering junctions and edges. The junctions can be further classified
into two substructures, that is, transient junction and permanent
junction.6,7 Further, permanent junctions include side
branching and tip branching.6,8 Here, the role of nucleation
of individual fibers is also critical and can occur under two conditions:
(a) low super saturation, where fibers grow in one dimension with
less branching; and (b) high super saturation, facilitating the growth
of a densely branched morphology, also known as spherulitic growth.5 Hence, these observations give an idea about
the self-assembly, which further helps in understanding the microstructure.

Triazole and benzimidazole having electron-rich and electron-poor
sites in the molecular structure are good candidates for intermolecular
self-assembly (Supporting Information, Figure S43). The literature reports extensively about the self-aggregation
property in benzimidazole and triazole.9−11 The reason behind this
is due to its multiple ways to form π–π stacking
and hydrogen bonding interaction.12−14

Recently, we developed
new small molecules for anticancer activity,
with two pharmacophores in one compound, benzimidazole and triazole.
After carrying out NMR (in DMSO-d6solvent)
on 1-ethyl-2-((4-(4-fluorophenyl)-1H-1,2,3-triazol-1-yl)methyl)-1H-benzo[d]imidazole (A6),
the NMR tube remained on the table overnight (room temperatureRT =
25 to 30 °C.). In the morning, the solution inside the NMR tube
became solid (Figure 1). Proving the “‘molecular’ origin” of
this gel forming ability due to self-aggregation is a subject of this
work. The objective is studied with the help of (a) NMR,: effect in
chemical shift due to the addition of water; (b) polarizing microscopy:
growth of self-aggregation; (c) thermal behavior; (d) single single-crystal
X-ray diffraction; and (f) designing of new modeled regio-isomeric
compounds with increasing hydrogen bonding sites.

Results and Discussion
Design
and Synthesis
Synthesis of N-((1-((1-ethyl-1H-benzo[d]imidazol-2-yl)methyl)-1H-1,2,3-triazol-4-yl)methyl)aniline (A6) was
carried out, as shown in Scheme 1. o-Nitroaniline (1)
was converted to an N-ethyl derivative using ethyl
bromide as per the reported procedure. Further, compound 2 was reduced to compound 3 using iron powder. 2-Chlorobenzimidazole
derivative (4) was synthesized by reacting 3 with two different reagents: 2-chloroacetyl chloride and 2-chloroacetic
acid. Both these reactions gave a comparable yield. 4 was then transformed into 2-(azidomethyl)-1H-benzo[d]imidazole (5) using sodium azide in dry DMSO.
The reaction condition, especially solvent selection, was optimized
to get the best yields. In accordance with theory, DMSO, aprotic polar
solvent, proved to be a solvent of choice, because it favors the conversion
of both 4 to 5 and 5 to 6 by favoring both, SN2 reaction, and 1,3-dipolar
cycloaddition reaction. Without isolating compound 5,
in-situ, by adding alkyne derivatives, click chemistry was performed
to obtain the final compound 6.15

Seven other new molecules were
designed and synthesized to enhance
hydrogen bonding by altering three key places: (i) changing electron-donating
effect (−I effect), the presence or absence of fluoro group
in the compound; (ii) changing rigidity and/or flexibility near triazole,
the addition/deletion of phenyl/aniline moiety; and (iii) directly
replacing hydrogen bonding sites with bulkier hydrophobic groups,
the presence/absence of ethyl groups on benzimidazole moiety’s
aromatic ring nitrogen. In total, eight compounds (Figures 2 and 3) with this aim were considered for the investigation, out of which
five derivatives were taken from our laboratory’s previous
work.15 All the compounds are completely
characterized using elemental analysis and 1H- and 13C-NMR study (Supporting Information, Figures S1–S26).

Microscopic Studies
Real-time images using a polarizing
optical microscopy for A6 was captured (Figure 4). Initially, the compound
was dissolved in DMSO. A drop of this solution is taken on a slide,
and then, a very fine small drop of water is added in the center (a
detailed quantitative water addition experiment is probed using NMR
experiments is discussed in the following section). Image in Figure 4a shows the clear
solution of compound dissolution in DMSO. Image in Figure 4b was captured after 1 min
of water addition, which showed initiation of a self-assembled structure.
Image in Figure 4c
was captured after 2 min, showing the mature fibrillar growth. After
5 min, image in Figure 4d clearly showed a one-dimensional fiber initially with spherulitic
growth and then fibrillar growth with both tip branching and side
branching. Images of fibers in Figure 4e–g were captured after 15 min clearly showed
the morphology of fibers. Is this a case specific for A6 compound? No, we observed a quite similar evolution of self-assembly-driven
aggregation pattern for all the other compounds (Supporting Information, Figures S34–S36).

Figure 4 POM images
of A6 (a–d) show real-time images
after the water addition at various times for 4× and (e–g)
show images of fibers at various magnifications after 15 min.

Thermal Studies
Thermal behavior of A6 shows a clear signature of endothermic
phase transition at 125 °C
in both TG-DTA and DSC studies (Figure 5a–d). On the other hand, when a gel of A6 (by the addition of water to DMSO solution of A6) was subjected for a similar study, it results in a broad signature
centered at the same transition temperature. This suggests that the
addition of water triggers the phase transition at a much lower temperature
or lowers down the onset of this phase transition. TG-DTA for solid A6 shows the thermal stability up to 220 °C with water
“absorption” or retention up to 80% until 125 °C.
This prompted us to study water “sorption” for all the
synthesized compounds, which is listed in Supporting Information, Figures S5 and S27–29.

of A6 (a) solid and (b) after water addition
(self-aggregation). (c, d) DSC graphs of A6 (c) solid and (d) after
water addition (self-assembly).

Single-Crystal Studies
A single crystal for A6 (ethylaniline) was developed using a slow evaporation technique
from ethyl acetate and petroleum ether as solvent. A6 gets crystallized in an orthorhombic crystal system with space group Pna21. Using the same solvent system, we also
obtained a single crystal for A2 (ethyl phenyl), which
gets crystallized in a triclinic crystal system with space group P1 (Supporting Information, Table S2).

Figure 6 shows
the unit cell of A6, with four asymmetric molecules.
It has a C (or cup)-shape structure, where the central (or bottom)
“triazole” moiety is flanked by the two benzyl groups
with an angle of 86.23 and 86.61°. The two probable reasons for
the observed “C” (or cup)-shape structure are (a) the
“inner” orientation of ethyl groups to minimize interaction
with the surrounding solvent and (b) close contacts of aniline with
the neighboring molecules. Because of the absence of this later interaction, A2 crystallizes in an L or twisted planar shape, as shown
in Figure 7. A2 has only two but distinct “dimeric” close
contacts, one along the a axis while the other along
its exactly perpendicular c axis. The former is between
the nitrogen of triazole and (neighboring molecules) hydrogens of
benzylic carbon bridged between triazole and benzimidazole, whereas
the latter dimeric “close contact” exists between two
triazole-linked benzene rings (2 and 3 hydrogens). Overall, these
two dimer-directed close contacts, as represented in Figure 7c as A–B and A′–B,
lead to a cascading networked structure.

Crystallographic Data Centre under CCDC 1828854.

Both the single-crystal studies show the absence of hydrogen
bonding
and π–π stacking but the distinct presence of “pro-aggregation”
topology in the form of close contacts in the solid state.

Nuclear
Magnetic Resonance (NMR)
Initially, care is
taken to correctly label the protons in all eight molecules using
correlation spectroscopy (COSY) and heteronuclear single-quantum correlation
spectroscopy (HSQC) experiments (Supporting Information, Figures S1–S26). Then, two different NMR experiments
were planned: (i) water addition and (ii) a concentration-dependent
experiment.

For water addition NMR, A6 (10 mg) was dissolved in
DMSO-d6 (0.5 mL), the 1H NMR
was recorded, and after this, D2O was added slowly to perform
titration experiments. Each titration consists of aliquots of 10,
20, 30, 30, 30, 30, and 30 μL of D2O. We observed
chemical shift perturbation in the titration experiments. All the
peaks faced expected chemical shift perturbation except the 1 and
4 protons, which showed merging of the separated peaks (multiplet
to two distinct doublet) (Figure 8). The reason for the chemical shift perturbation can
be due to prototropic tautomerism, as proposed in Figure 9. Interestingly, for non-ethyl
derivative A7, these 1,4 protons behaved exactly opposite
and showed separation to the merged peaks. All four ethyl and four
non-ethyl compounds show the same trend, as shown in Supporting Information.

each titration
is given on the right).

(b) Structure of the free rotation along the CH2 linker.
(c) After water addition equivalency of two N’s of benzimidazole
ring. (d) After water addition non-equivalency of the ethyl derivative.

Water addition proton NMR studies
for all the eight molecules showed
four distinct features: (a) CH2 imidazole linker’s
shifting is more prominent with ethyl derivatives as compared with
non-ethyl ones; (b) triazole ring proton shifting is more for phenyl
rings as compared to aniline rings, where structures are C and cross-L
type; (c) shifting of ortho phenyl ring protons is more for phenyl
ring derivatives; and (d) methyl protons show more upfield shift in
aniline derivatives as compared to phenyl derivatives. In a concentration-dependent
NMR for A4, proton 3 shifts downfield while proton 2
shifts upfield. Also, the 1,4 proton splits from triplet to two separate
doublets.

As per designing of the structure, all the eight molecules
are
inherently flexible because of the utilization of single bond in connecting
the two pharmacophores: benzimidazole and central triazole. Therefore,
it is likely to adopt a number of conformations separated by low energetic
barriers. This is especially true in organic solutions, for example,
dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), where the greasy aromatic elements of the
hosts are well solvated. In D2O, however, the geometries
adopted will depend on the inherent bond rotational preferences of
the molecules (as in DMSO) as well as aromatic clustering driven by
the hydrophobic effect.

The molecular origin of these observations
can be correlated to
the molecular dynamics in a solution phase because of the structure.
The presence of ethyl groups at the benzimidazole nitrogen and intramolecular
hydrogen bonding stops the free rotation around the benzylic carbon
bridged between benzimidazole and triazole. The reverse is observed
in the case of non-ethyl compounds, as depicted in Figure 9. Also, downfield shifting
of the second proton and upfield shifting of the third proton play
a critical role in aggregation behavior. Both these factors correlate
perfectly with the “close contacts” observed in the
single-crystal data.

Conclusions
The present work outlines
a simple synthetic strategy of designing
novel anticancer drugs with more than one pharmacophore using in situ
click chemistry. It is focused on revealing the molecular origin of
unusual solidification of flexible regioisomeric benzimidazole-bridged
triazole molecules in the NMR tube. Microscopic and NMR experiments
have shown that all eight synthesized compounds exhibit self-aggregation-directed
gel formation in the presence of water. The change in NMR correlates
correctly to the solid-state structure observed in a single-crystal
X-ray study. Interestingly, the observed aggregation is not influenced
by the π–π stacking and/or hydrogen bonding as
expected in benzimidazole-based compounds but marks the origin in
van der Waal-type “close contacts” observed in a structural
investigation. A similar aggregation in the presence of water might
be of use for future formulation and/or therapeutic treatments.

Experimental
Section
Materials and Methods
TLC analysis was done using precoated
silica on aluminum sheets. An FT-IR (KBr pellets) spectrum was recorded
in the range of 4000–400 cm–1 using a Perkin-Elmer
FT-IR spectrometer. The NMR spectra were obtained by a Bruker AV-III
400 MHz spectrometer using TMS as an internal standard. The chemical
shifts were reported in parts per million (ppm), coupling constants
(J) were expressed in hertz (Hz), and signals were
described as singlet (s), doublet (d), triplet (t), and multiplet
(m). The mass spectra were recorded on Thermo Scientific DSQ-II. All
chemicals and solvents were of commercial grade and were used without
further purification. Single-crystal data was collected using Xcalibur
(EoS, Gemini). Thermogravimetric analyses (TG-DTA) were performed
using a SII TG/DTA 6300 EXSTAR analyzer under N2 atmosphere.
