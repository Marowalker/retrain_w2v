Based on first-principles
density functional theory calculations,
we investigated a modified routine using hydroxyl adsorption that
recently demonstrated the controlled growth of MoS2 monolayers.
The new growth approach impedes the deposition of a second MoS2 layer; however, the hydroxyl adsorption and its effects have
been mostly unexplored. Through this study, we first explored the
adsorption behaviors of the hydroxyl radical (OH) on monolayer MoS2 and briefly discussed its effects on the stability and electronic
structure. Monolayer MoS2 repels charged OH–, whereas the adsorption of the neutral OH radical is energetically
favorable; the corresponding adsorption energies are 0.09 eV and −1.35
eV, respectively. The diffusion barrier of the OH radical on MoS2 is 0.52 eV, indicating that the molecule can quickly diffuse.
Next, the study demonstrated that for multiple OH adsorptions, a concerted
reaction including OH dissociation and H2O formation is
more energetically favorable than the adsorption of two OH molecules
by 2.50 eV, which in turn results in a mixed adsorption configuration
of O and OH. In addition, we revealed that the OH adsorption creates
a mid-gap state and facilitates the reconstruction of the MoS2 edge.

Introduction
Transition-metal dichalcogenides
(TMDs) exhibit abundant electronic
and optical properties in addition to remarkable mechanical flexibility.1−3 Among TMD members, MoS2 has been the most intensively
studied TMD because of its tunable band gap and superior stability.
MoS2 has both metallic (1T) and semiconducting (2H) phases.4,5 The electronic properties of semiconducting MoS2 are
highly tunable, which makes it ideal for designing electronic and
optoelectronic devices.3,6,7 For
example, MoS2 shows a transition from an indirect to a
direct band gap when its thickness is reduced down to a single layer.1,8 This property of monolayer MoS2 makes it particularly
important because it can take advantage of the direct band gap, which
can effectively excite electrons. Moreover, the controllable valley
degree of freedom of an electron in monolayer MoS2 can
also be useful for manipulating information in data storage devices.9,10 MoS2 layers can be grown on or inserted into van der
Waals (vdW) heterolayers to provide desired properties via vdW epitaxial
growth,11,12 where controlled growth is highly desirable
for accurate fabrication of a defined heterostructure.

Several
growth approaches have been employed on various substrates
for producing large-area monolayer MoS2.13−15 However, the
growth of MoS2 has suffered from high defect densities
and small domain sizes primarily because of a nucleation preference
at defects on substrates.16−18 Both controlling the number and
improving the quality of grown MoS2 layers, therefore,
become more challenging. Our previous work proposed a new controlled
growth method using OH molecules to grow high-quality, large-area
monolayer MoS2 with a low defect density, which could be
used to grow MoS2 on arbitrary substrates.18 The presence of OH can enhance the binding between MoS2 and the substrates, which stabilizes the grown MoS2 layer. Moreover, the adsorbed OH molecules can passivate the first
MoS2 layer, thereby suppressing the vertical growth of
a second MoS2 layer. This facilitates the lateral growth
of monolayer MoS2. Previous studies have investigated the
adsorption of OH on MoS2 and other 2D materials regarding
catalytic applications.19,20 However, the adsorption
behaviors of OH and its effects on the properties of monolayer MoS2 are mostly unexplored.

In this study, we used first-principles
density functional theory
(DFT) calculations to systematically investigate the adsorption behaviors
of OH and its effects on monolayer MoS2. Our data first
revealed that the adsorption of OH is energetically favorable, with
an adsorption energy Eads of −1.35
eV, in contrast to the endothermic adsorption (Eads = 0.09 eV) of charged OH–. Inclusion
of an Al2O3 substrate lowers the Eads of OH by only 0.05 eV but causes the adsorption of
OH– to become exothermic (Eads = −0.21 eV). The adsorbed OH can quickly diffuse
on MoS2. More importantly, for multiple OH adsorptions,
we predicted a concerted reaction of OH dissociation and H2O formation, which stabilizes the system substantially. This reaction
results in a mixed adsorption configuration of O and OH on MoS2, a valuable finding for understanding the role of OH adsorption
on the growth of MoS2. Our detailed calculations further
demonstrated that the OH adsorption creates a mid-gap state and makes
the reconstruction of the MoS2 zigzag edge more energetically
favorable. These findings not only deepen our understanding of the
adsorption behavior of OH on MoS2 but also may prove instrumental
in further improving the growth of MoS2.

Results and Discussion
We first determined the favorable atomic configurations of OH– and OH adsorbed on monolayer MoS2. Here,
we considered several possible adsorption sites, and Figure 1 displays the ground-state
adsorption structures for OH– and OH. For the charged
OH– ion, adsorption was an endothermic reaction
and the adsorption energy Eads was 0.09
eV. Within the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) scheme (without
van der Waals correction), Eads was even
higher (0.27 eV), indicating that OH– and monolayer
MoS2 repel in a chemical reaction. The length of the O–H
bond and the shortest distance between O and S atoms were 0.98 and
2.53 Å, respectively. The differences in Eads and the O–H bond lengths among different adsorption
sites were less than 0.08 eV and 0.01 Å, respectively. On the
other hand, the ground-state adsorption site for neutral OH was on
top of the S atom (Figure 1b) and the corresponding Eads was
−1.35 eV, which was in good agreement with a previous DFT study.21 These results show that the adsorption of neutral
OH is spontaneous and therefore energetically favorable. Consequently,
we focused on the adsorption of neutral OH rather than charged OH– hereafter. Eads without
the van der Waals correction was also slightly higher (−1.16
eV), showing that the adsorbed OH molecule was chemically bound to
MoS2. The lengths of the O–H and O–S bonds
were 0.98 and 1.80 Å, respectively. We considered different orientations
of OH molecules adsorbed on the S site. Eads for the different OH orientations was slightly higher (∼0.02
eV) than that of the ground state, showing that the effects of molecular
orientation on Eads are negligible.

side view of the optimized atomic structures of (a)
charged OH– and (b) neutral OH adsorbed on monolayer
MoS2. The numbers represent the distance between the O
and S atoms.

Next, we investigated the energy
profile for the diffusion reaction
of the adsorbed OH on monolayer MoS2 to understand diffusion
kinetics. Here, we used the nudged elastic band method22 with five intermediate images constructed along
the reaction pathway. Figure 2 shows the calculated energy profile together with the atomic
geometries of the initial, transition, and final states. The minimum-energy
diffusion occurs through a path between two neighboring S atoms. In
the transition state, OH was located at the halfway point of the reaction
pathway, where the distance between the O and S (Mo) atoms is 2.51
(3.77) Å. The transition state was 0.52 eV higher than the initial
and final states, yielding an energy barrier of 0.52 eV against the
diffusion reaction. This value is lower than or comparable with those
of metal atoms on MoS2.23,24 We estimated
the diffusion rate (D) at 300 K to be approximately
1.9 × 104 s–1, using an Arrhenius-type
equation, D = A·exp[−Ea/(KBT)], and a typical pre-exponential factor (A) of
1013 Hz, where KB is the Boltzmann
constant and T is the temperature. This suggests
that OH molecules quickly diffuse on MoS2.

of the diffusion process for an adsorbed
OH molecule on monolayer MoS2. The atomic geometries of
the initial state (IS), transition state (TS), and final state (FS)
are also displayed. The energy barrier against diffusion is 0.52 eV.

Next, we examined the electronic structure of the
OH-adsorbed MoS2. Figure 3a
displays the calculated density of states (DOS) of clean MoS2 and OH-adsorbed MoS2. Based on the DOS, the band gap
of monolayer MoS2 was estimated to be 1.64 eV, which was
consistent with previous DFT calculations.25,26 A comparison of the DOS of clean MoS2 and OH-adsorbed
MoS2 shows that the adsorption of OH creates a mid-gap
state within the bandgap of MoS2. The charge density differences
(Δρ), defined as Δρ = ρ(OH/MoS2) – ρ(OH) – ρ(MoS2), show that,
upon OH adsorption, electrons were primarily redistributed at the
OH molecule and the adsorption site, forming an O–S bond (Figure 3b). These data demonstrate
that the peak near the Fermi level in the DOS arises from the O–S
bond.

Figure 3 (a) DOS of clean MoS2 and OH-adsorbed MoS2 (OH/MoS2). To compare the DOS of two different systems,
we set the zero-energy reference to the individual valence band maximum.
(b) Charge density difference plot of OH/MoS2. Here, the
charge density difference (Δρ) is defined as Δρ
= ρ(OH/MoS2) – ρ(OH) – ρ(MoS2). The charge density differences are drawn with isosurfaces
of 0.01 (blue) and −0.01 (yellow) e/Bohr3.

Next, we investigated the adsorption of another
OH molecule near
the first adsorbed molecule. Here, we considered two possible scenarios:
(1) the adsorption of a second OH molecule on a different adsorption
site, as shown in Figure 4a, and (2) a concerted reaction of OH dissociation and H2O formation, as shown in Figure 4b. For scenario 1, the adsorption of the
second OH was also energetically favorable; the Eads of the second OH is −2.05 eV, which is even
higher than that of the first Eads. The
O–S bond lengths for the first and the second OH were 1.65
and 2.02 Å, respectively, which are 0.15 Å shorter and 0.22
Å longer than that of the originally adsorbed OH molecule. These
results indicate that two adsorbed OH molecules are attractive. The
resulting configuration of the second scenario included the adsorption
of atomic O on top of the S site, forming a hydrogen bond with an
H2O molecule. The distances between the O and H (S) atoms
were 1.93 (1.49) Å. The corresponding Eads was −4.63 eV, which is lower than that of scenario
1 by 2.58 eV. The concerted reaction of scenario 2 can be initiated
from the resulting state of scenario 1, and our transition state calculations
reveal that the process is a barrier-less reaction (Figure S2). This indicates that two neighboring adsorbed OH
can spontaneously initiate the concerted reaction, while two separate
OH should overcome the diffusion barrier. Thus, we can conclude that
the concerted reaction is energetically favorable on MoS2.

OH molecules adsorbed on monolayer MoS2: (a) scenario 1
and (b) scenario 2. The numbers represent the distances between atoms.

Many 2D materials have been grown on substrates,
and the substrate
can affect the chemistry of the adsorbate. To examine the effects
of a substrate, we investigated the adsorption of OH (OH–) on monolayer MoS2 deposited on a sapphire [α-Al2O3(001)] substrate, considering the fact that monolayer
MoS2 growth was successfully achieved on this substrate
in our previous experiment.18 For the adsorption
of OH–, Eads was −0.21
eV, which indicates that the adsorption was exothermic, whereas the
length of the OH bond was unchanged, the shortest distance between
O and S atoms was 2.28 Å, which is shorter than the value (2.53
Å) without the substrate. On the other hand, Eads, O–H, and O–S bond lengths for a neutral
OH were −1.40 eV, 0.98, and 1.80 Å, respectively, which
are almost the same compared to those without the substrate. For both
charged and neutral cases, changes in the structure of the MoS2 layer are negligible. Our Bader charge analysis reveals that
the total number of transferred charges from the Al2O3 substrate to the OH-adsorbed MoS2 is ∼0.2e per unit cell. These charges are mostly transferred to
the adsorbed OH (OH–), which also modifies the electronic
structure (see DOS in Figure S1). Overall,
the adsorption on MoS2/α-Al2O3(001) is energetically favorable for both OH– and
OH.

To further investigate the high-coverage adsorption of OH,
we performed
ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations at 300 K and included
the sapphire substrate. Figure 5 displays the final structures after 0.1 ps simulations together
with the energy profiles of the OH molecules on monolayer MoS2. During the AIMD simulations, monolayer MoS2 remained
nearly intact with slight changes in the Mo–S bond lengths
(at most 0.18 Å), indicating that the MoS2 layer was
stable even over multiple OH adsorptions. Similar to the case with
two OH molecules adsorbing, H2O molecules were formed and
the remaining O atoms were adsorbed on S atoms, which in turn created
the O–S bonds. The calculated energy profile shows that these
concerted reactions significantly lowered the total energies of the
systems. A previous DFT study suggested that H2O also prefers
chemisorption and dissociation into OH and H on MoS2.21 This fact implies that the H2O molecules
formed by the concerted reaction can also undergo separation into
OH and H again, eventually leaving a mixed adsorption configuration
of OH and O.

Figure 5 (a) Atomic geometry of OH molecules on monolayer MoS2 after a 0.1 ps AIMD simulation. (b) Corresponding energy
profile
during the simulation.

The reconstruction of
the TMD edges plays a crucial role in the
growth of TMD layers,27 and the adsorption
of OH may affect the energies of such a reconstruction. To examine
this possibility for MoS2, we compared the relative energies
of reconstructed and unreconstructed MoS2 edges in the
presence of OH. It is notable that the zigzag edge of MoSe2, which is Mo-terminated, showed a 2 × 1 reconstruction that
substantially lowered the energy.27 Similarly,
the 2 × 1 reconstruction of the MoS2 zigzag edge (Figure 6) reduced the total
energy by 0.37 eV per supercell, while for the armchair edge, no structural
change was found to be energetically favorable. Figure 6c,d display the optimized structures of OH-adsorbed
zigzag edges. For the unreconstructed edge, the adsorption energies
of OH– and OH were −1.49 and −2.46
eV, respectively. This indicates that the edge is an active adsorption
site for both OH– and OH. After the OH adsorption,
the 2 × 1 reconstructed edge is much lower in energy than the
unreconstructed edge, by 1.35 eV per supercell. This indicates that
the edge reconstruction is energetically favorable in the presence
of OH. For comparison, the effects of O adsorption on the energies
of the MoS2 edge were also investigated. As an O atom adsorbed
at the edge, the reconstructed edge was 0.31 eV lower in energy than
the unreconstructed edge, which was nearly the same as the clean edge.
Overall, these data imply that the OH (OH–) adsorption
facilitates the 2 × 1 reconstruction of the zigzag edge.

Conclusions
In conclusion, we have
investigated the adsorption of OH– and OH on monolayer
MoS2. The adsorption of OH– is weak,
with an adsorption energy ranging from 0.09 to −0.21
eV, while that of OH is much stronger, with the adsorption energy
of −1.35 eV. We further revealed that the concerted reaction,
involving OH dissociation and H2O formation, dramatically
lowers the total energy and, therefore, a mixed adsorption configuration
of O and OH is energetically preferred. This is also confirmed by
our molecular dynamics simulations. Finally, we demonstrated that
the adsorption of OH could modify the energies of MoS2 edge
reconstructions, an essential factor that can affect the properties
of MoS2. These central findings may prove instrumental
in further improving the growth of MoS2 and, therefore,
are expected to stimulate future studies in this research field. In
particular, the delicate chemical reactions of OH on MoS2 and its effects on the growth of MoS2 are still an open
question.

Computational Methods
The first-principles DFT calculations
were performed using the
Vienna Ab-initio Simulation Package (VASP).28,29 The projector-augmented wave30 method
and the PBE exchange–correlation functional31 were used for the calculations. A semiclassical dispersion
correction scheme (DFT-D3)32 was employed
to include the effects of long-range vdW interactions, within which
the optimized lattice parameters for bulk MoS2 are a = b = 3.15 Å and c = 17.95 Å. An MoS2 monolayer grown on a sapphire
substrate was simulated by a supercell of 12-layer p(2 × 2) α-Al2O3(001) and a(3 × 3) MoS2 monolayer. MoS2 nanoribbons were simulated using a periodic supercell with a ribbon
width of approximately 20 Å and a vacuum space of approximately
20 Å. All the simulated structures included a vacuum space of
approximately 20 Å in the out-of-plane direction. During structural
optimization, all the atoms except the bottom five atomic layers of
α-Al2O3(001) were allowed to relax until
the force exerted on each atom was less than 0.02 eV/Å. The Brillouin
zones were sampled using a 15 × 15 × 1 mesh for Al2O3(001) and a 16 × 1 × 1 mesh for MoS2 nanoribbons. The cutoff energy used for the plane-wave basis set
was 500 eV. A canonical ensemble was adopted for the AIMD simulation
using the algorithm of Nosé,33 and
the time interval for the ionic motion was 0.1 fs. For neutral systems,
the adsorption energy (Eads) was defined
as  where Etot(MoS2), Etot(adsorbate), and Etot(adsorbate/MoS2) represent the
total energy for the MoS2, adsorbate, and OH (O or H2O)-adsorbed MoS2, respectively. The charged systems
were simulated by using homogeneous background charges, and Eads was calculated in the same way as described
in a previous DFT study.20
