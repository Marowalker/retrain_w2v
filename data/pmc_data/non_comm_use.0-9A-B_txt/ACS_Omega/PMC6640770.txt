A series of dyes 2–5 based on
5-thienyl-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole and 5-thienyl-2,1,3-benzoselenadiazole
cores were synthesized as near-infrared-emitting two-photon-absorbing
fluorophores. Fluorescence maxima wavelengths as long as 714 nm and
quantum yields as high as 0.67 were realized. The fluorescence quantum
yields of dyes 2–4 were nearly constant,
regardless of solvent polarity. These diazoles exhibited large Stokes
shifts (>110 nm) and high two-photon figure of merit. Cells incubated
on a 3D scaffold with probe 4 (encapsulated in Pluronic
micelles) exhibited bright fluorescence, enabling 3D two-photon fluorescence
imaging to a depth of 100 μm.

Introduction
Imaging biological
samples via two-photon fluorescence microscopy
(2PFM) has a unique advantage of realizing high-contrast 3D subcellular
images up to several millimeters depth.1−7 Hence, 2PFM has been widely used for various imaging applications,
such as for investigating brain or neural network dynamics,8−12 visualizing kidney dynamics,13 studying
the chemistry of vision and the structure of skin,14,15 and for imaging vascular morphology and density.16,17 However, 2PFM has not migrated into clinical applications. One possible
explanation for the lack of clinical use of 2PFM is the relatively
shallow depth (micrometers to millimeters) it can achieve relative
to other deep tissue imaging techniques, such as photoacoustic imaging
or even computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging in clinical
applications, although its resolution is generally superior. Recently,
progress has been reported in the application of near-infrared (NIR)
fluorescent probes to overcome depth challenges in intraoperative
microscopic image-guided cancer surgery.18−20 Biomaterials
in general have an optical window in the NIR between 700 and 900 nm,
in which the absorption of many biological materials is at a minimum;21 hence, light can penetrate deeper, up to centimeters
through blood and tissues.22 Several NIR
imaging systems have been developed for intraoperative NIR fluorescence
imaging.23−31 One of them, a system called fluorescence-assisted resection and
exploration (developed by Harvard’s Beth Israel Deaconess Medical
Center) is under clinical trials for use in the colon and breast cancer
surgery.30 This technique employs conventional
(one-photon) fluorescence, whereas two-photon fluorescence imaging
possesses some advantages with its higher fluorescence signal-to-noise
ratio because of its unique highly localized excitation.

Two-photon
excitation in 2PFM is typically conducted in the NIR.
Therefore, probes that undergo two-photon absorption (2PA) in the
NIR and fluoresce in the far-red to NIR region with high quantum yields
are particularly desirable to achieve deep tissue imaging. In addition,
to realize high-quality 2PFM images, other properties need to be optimized,
such as high 2PA cross section and high photostability. Molecules
that can fulfill these requirements are fairly limited. Most of the
reported NIR fluorescent probes for one-photon NIR imaging have not
been thoroughly evaluated in two-photon applications. Among those
that have been examined, the most commonly used are cyanine dyes,
such as commercially available indocyanine green, Cy5, or Cy7. These
have been used as fluorophores for some time, and they possess relatively
high 2PA cross sections (hundreds to thousands of Göppert Mayer
(GM) units, 1 GM = 1 × 10–50 cm4 s/photon), although they are photochemically labile.

One particular
type of cyanine dye, squaraine, possesses a 2PA
cross section of tens of thousands of GM units.32−37 However, most squaraines suffer from low photochemical and nucleophile
stability and have strong adsorption on plasma proteins. When applied
in aqueous solution, strong dye aggregation often quenches fluorescence.
For example, a squaraine dye reported in our previous study has 2PA
cross sections of >10 000 GM, but in water, the fluorescence
was quenched, and when encapsulated in Pluronic micelles, its fluorescence
quantum yield was only about 4%.38

Boron-dipyrromethene (BODIPY) dyes are photostable, and their fluorescence
quantum yields are high. Most reported BODIPY compounds for 2PFM bioimaging
have low 2PA cross sections, ranging from 10 to <300 GM.39−42 Some of our recent efforts resulted in compounds with much improved
2PA cross sections (to >1000 GM), and their application in deep
tissue
imaging is still under evaluation.43 Other
NIR dyes can be found in the literature, although only a few were
reported for 2PFM bioimaging,44 including
one that functioned better when encapsulated in silica nanoparticles,
by aggregation-enhanced emission.45

To increase the candidate pool of highly efficient NIR probes for
NIR 2PFM imaging and image-guided surgical applications, a class of
chromophores with a 5-thienyl-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole core designed
for organic photovoltaic devices and fluorescence bioprobes46,47 caught our attention. A typical derivative, compound 1 (Figure 1), exhibited
strong red fluorescence. Recently, it has been reported that an analogue
of this dye (with alkyl groups attached to thiophene rings) exhibited
a high fluorescence quantum yield, for example, 0.85 in chloroform,
with an emission maximum of 651 nm.48 In
that study, an effort was taken to study a series of analogues but
with limited success on finding dyes with longer emission wavelengths
and reasonably high fluorescence quantum yields. Herein, we report
a series of dyes (2–5, Figure 1) based on parent 1 that were designed to achieve emission in the NIR while maintaining
high fluorescence quantum yields and high 2PA absorptivity. Preliminary
investigation for the potential of one of these dyes for 2PFM NIR
imaging is disclosed.49

Results and Discussion
Bis-thienylbenzothiadiazole 2 was prepared by Stille
coupling of 4,7-bis(5-(trimethylstannyl)thiophen-2-yl)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole 16, which was synthesized
according to a method described in the literature,50 with 9,9-didecyl-2-iodo-7-(phenylsulfonyl)-9H-fluorene 10 in 63% yield (Figure 2). Intermediate 10 was synthesized
by alkylation of 2-iodo-7-(phenylsulfonyl)-9H-fluorene 9 using bromodecane in the presence of KI, powdered KOH, and
dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), following a similar procedure used in our
previous study (Figures 2 and 3).51 The
preparation of sulfone 9 was accomplished by iodination
of the known compound 2-(phenylsulfonyl)-9H-fluorene 8(52) with periodic acid and iodine
in HOAc/H2O/H2SO4 (100:20:3), giving
a high yield of 85%. Dye 3 was prepared (Figure 3) in moderate yield (35%) by
Stille coupling of 16 with 2-bromo-5-(9,9-didecyl-7-(phenylsulfonyl)-9H-fluoren-2-yl)thiophene 13, which was in turn
synthesized by brominating 2-(9,9-didecyl-7-(phenylsulfonyl)-9H-fluoren-2-yl)thiophene 12 with N-bromosuccinimide (NBS) in AcOH/CHCl3 (1:5). The thiophenyl
group in 12 was introduced into compound 10 by another Stille coupling with 2-(tributylstannyl)thiophene 11 (Figure 2).

Bis-ethynylthienylbenzothiadiazole 4 was prepared
(Figure 3) by Sonogashira
reaction of commercially available bis(2-bromo-5-thienyl)-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole 17 with 9,9-didecyl-2-ethynyl-7-(phenylsulfonyl)-9H-fluorene 15 (Figure 2) in a toluene/Et3N mixture, catalyzed
by PdCl2(PPh3)2 and CuI, in 35% yield.
Alkynyl fluorene 15 was synthesized by deprotection of 14 using K2CO3 as a base. Compound 14is
the product obtained from the reaction of 9,9-didecyl-2-iodo-7-(phenylsulfonyl)-9H-fluorene (10) with trimethylsilylacetylene
in toluene, using PdCl2(PPh3)2 and
CuI as a catalyst and N,N-diisopropylamine
as a base.

Bis-thienylbenzoselenadiazole 5 (Figure 3) was prepared by
a one-pot
Suzuki reaction. 2-Bromo-5-(9,9-didecyl-7-(phenylsulfonyl)-9H-fluoren-2-yl)thiophene 13 was converted to
a borate ester in situ by first adding n-BuLi and
then trimethylborate at −78 °C. The resulting solution
was used directly for Suzuki coupling with 4,7-dibromobenzo[c][1,2,5]selenadiazole 18 in the presence of
ethylene glycol and Pd(PPh3)4 in 28% overall
yield.

The absorption spectra, fluorescence spectra, and fluorescence
quantum yields of dyes 2–5 were measured
in three solvents, that is, in toluene, tetrahydrofuran (THF), and
methylene chloride. Figure 4 shows the spectra measured in methylene chloride (see Figures S1–S4 for spectra measured in
all three solvents). In all of these solvents, the absorption spectra
of all four dyes exhibit no significant changes in their spectral
profiles or absorption maxima. With increasing solvent polarity, bathochromic
shifts in fluorescence were observed for all four dyes, although only
moderately, from 21 nm for dye 4 to 36 nm for dye 5. The fluorescence quantum yields of 0.60–0.67, 0.27–0.28,
and 0.64–0.66 for dyes 2–4, respectively, were fairly constant in the three solvents investigated,
implying that these dyes may maintain a relatively high fluorescence
quantum yield in water when used as fluorescence bioimaging probes.
This is a very interesting topic currently driving the synthesis of
hydrophilic versions of these dyes. Excitation anisotropy spectra
of all four dyes look similar, indicating an S0–S1 transition in the long wavelength band and another major
transition at approximately 400 nm, corresponding to a two-photon
allowed transition. These dyes also showed Stokes shifts greater than
110 nm, suggesting little reabsorption of fluorescence even when the
local concentration is high.

Figure 4 Absorption spectra (1, red, in
CH2Cl2), fluorescence spectra (2, excited at the maximum
absorption wavelengths, black, in CH2Cl2), 2PA
spectra (3, blue, in CH2Cl2), and
excitation anisotropy (4, gray, in polyTHF) of dyes 2–5.

Figure 4 also
shows the 2PA spectra and
excitation
anisotropy spectra of dyes 2–5.49 The fluorescence maximum of 3 was
red-shifted 36 nm (to 683 nm) relative to that of 2,
as an extra thiophenyl group was introduced at each side of the benzothiadiazole
core. While this red shift is desirable for NIR imaging; unfortunately
there was a significant decrease in the fluorescence quantum yield,
from 0.60 for 2 to 0.27 for 3. Here, it
is reasonable to assume that the extra partially rotatable thiophenyl
groups in dye 3 reduced the molecular rigidity and hence
lowered the fluorescence quantum yield. On the other hand, the 2PA
cross section of 2800 GM at 700 nm for 3 was twice that
of 2 (1400 GM at 700 nm) because of its extended conjugation
(more polarizable) system.

To evaluate the overall performance
of a two-photon fluorescent
(2PF) probe, a figure of merit (FM, the
product of fluorescence quantum yield ΦFL and 2PA
cross section δ2PA normalized by the photodecomposition
quantum yield η), introduced in our previous study,53 was used. The photodecomposition quantum yields
of 2 and 3 in methylene chloride were 1.4
× 10–6 and 7.0 × 10–6, respectively. The higher η and lower ΦFL of dye 3 resulted in a FM of 1.08 × 10–4 GM, about 6-fold lower than
that of 2 at 6.00 × 10–4 GM, despite
its higher δ2PA, making it clear that dye 2 should be a more efficient 2PF probe than dye 3, even
though its δ2PA is lower. For this reason, dye 4 was designed and synthesized. The conjugation length of
dye 4 with respect to that of dye 2 was
extended by inserting an acetylene group between the fluorenyl group
and the thiophenyl group to provide a more polarizable chromophore.
The use of acetylene groups in dye 4 was also aimed to
maintain some rigidity and to help maintain a high fluorescence quantum
yield. Indeed, the fluorescence quantum yield of 0.64 for 4 in methylene chloride was comparable to that for 2.
The fluorescence maximum of 634 nm for 4 was slightly
blue-shifted relative to that of 2. The δ2PA of 4 in methylene chloride was 1100 GM at 700 nm, slightly
lower than that of 2. Considering the shorter absorption
wavelength of 4, 498 versus 506 nm for 2, it is reasonable to assume that the higher δ2PA value will appear at wavelengths shorter than 700 nm, which in this
study was not measured owing to possible interference of the tail
from the one-photon absorption. The photodecomposition quantum yield
of dye 4 was decreased to 6.72 × 10–8, resulting in a FM of 1.04 × 10–2 GM, a 17-fold improvement compared with that of dye 2.

In 5, selenium replaced sulfur in 2 to
further shift the absorption toward longer wavelength (538 nm), whereas
the fluorescence emission maximum moved to 714 nm. The longer fluorescence
wavelength should be beneficial for deep tissue imaging. Selenadiazole 5 had a fluorescence quantum yield ΦFL of
0.37, photodecomposition quantum yield η of 2.47 × 10−7, and δ2PA of 1150 GM at 740 nm,
affording a FM of 1.72 × 10−3 GM, making this a promising 2PF probe that exhibits longer wavelength
emission that the sulfur analog.

Because 4 exhibited
the highest FM, it was selected for evaluation
in 2PFM imaging. Cells
were incubated with 4 (encapsulated in Pluronic micelles)
and exhibited bright fluorescence in specific positions around the
cell nucleus area (Figure 5C,D) similar to our previous study using the same Pluronic
micelles with different dyes.54,55 Little fluorescence
was observed in a negative control (Figure 5A). To ascertain possible applications for
tissue imaging, cells cultured on a 3D scaffold were used as a model
system. As shown in Figure 6, bright two-photon fluorescence images were collected that
reached 100 μm in depth. Thus, this dye shows great potential
for deep tissue imaging, a subject of further investigation.

Conclusions
In summary, a series of dyes (2–5) based on 5-thienyl-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole
and 5-thienyl-2,1,3-benzoselenadiazole
cores designed to achieve NIR emission and high 2PF figure of merit
were successfully synthesized and characterized. The fluorescence
quantum yields of dyes 2 and 4 were quite
good at 0.60–0.67. Interestingly, the fluorescence quantum
yields for dyes 2–4 were almost constant
regardless of the solvents used. These dyes also showed Stokes shifts
larger than 110 nm, suggesting minimum reabsorption of fluorescence
even when the local concentration is high (e.g., in cells). Among
these dyes, the highest 2PF FM of 1.04
× 10–2 GM was determined for 4 when excited at 700 nm, whereas dye 2, with a longer
emission wavelength, possessed a very high FM of 6.0 × 10–4 GM (excited at 740 nm),
making both promising 2PF probes. Cells incubated on a 3D scaffold
with 4 (encapsulated in Pluronic micelles) exhibited
bright fluorescence, enabling high-contrast 3D 2PFM images up to 100
μm in depth. On the basis of these preliminary results, dyes 2–5 are promising candidates for intraoperative
NIR fluorescence microscopic image-guided surgery, using either one-photon
or two-photon excitation while the development of hydrophilic analogues
is currently under way.

Linear Optical Properties
All steady-state absorption,
fluorescence emission, excitation, and excitation anisotropy spectra
of dyes 2–5 were investigated in
10 mm path length quartz cuvettes at room temperature. The steady-state
absorption was measured with an Agilent 8453 UV–visible spectrophotometer.
Fluorescence emission and excitation spectra were obtained using an
Edinburgh Photonics FLS980 spectrometer equipped with a thermoelectric
cooled photomultiplier detector (Hamamatsu) and a liquid-nitrogen
cooled NIR-photomultiplier detector (Hamamatsu). All measurements
were carried out with the optical density below 0.12 at the excitation
wavelength to avoid reabsorption. The excitation and fluorescence
emission spectra were corrected for the spectral sensitivity of Edinburgh
Photonics excitation and detection system using factory-measured correction
files. Excitation anisotropy spectra were measured with two computer-controlled
polarizers in the FLS980 spectrometer in a high viscous solvent (polyTHF).

Fluorescence quantum yields were determined by a standard relative
method with rhodamine 6G (Φ ≈ 0.94 in ethanol) and cresyl
violet (Φ ≈ 0.54 in methanol) as a reference.56 The equation used is as follows  where Φ
is the quantum yield, the subscript
R refers to the reference, I is the integrated emission
signal, OD is the optical density at the excitation wavelength, n is the refractive index of the solvent, and RP is the
relative power of the light source of the spectrofluorimeter at the
excitation wavelength. Photochemical stability measurements of all
materials were carried out using continuous-wave (cw) diode laser
irradiation (λexc ≈ 532 nm for dye 2–5), and photodecomposition quantum yields, η,
were calculated using absorption methodology.57

Nonlinear Optical Properties
2PA spectra of dyes 2–5 were determined using an open-aperture Z-scan method using a femtosecond laser system (Coherent,
Inc.). The output of a Ti/sapphire laser (Mira 900-F, tuned to 800
nm, with a repetition rate of 76 MHz, average power ≈ 1.1 W,
and pulse duration ≈ 200 fs), pumped by the second harmonic
of Nd3+/YAG laser (Verdi-10), was regeneratively amplified
with a 1 kHz repetition rate (Legend Elite USP) providing ≈100
fs pulses (FWHM) with energy ≈ 3.6 mJ/pulse. This output at
800 nm was split into two separate beams and pumped two ultrafast
optical parametric amplifiers (OPAs) (OPerA Solo, Coherent Inc.) with
a tuning range of 0.24–20 μm, ≈100 fs (FWHM),
and pulse energies up to ≈100 μJ. A single laser beam
from the first OPA was used for the open aperture Z-scan method.58 2PA measurements were
carried out in 1 mm spectrofluorometric quartz cuvettes with a concentration
of 10–3 M ≤ C ≤ 10–2 M at room temperature.

Preparing Micelle with
Dye 4
A stock solution
of dye 4 was prepared in CH2Cl2 at a concentration of 0.1 mM. The stock solution was then mixed
with 0.25% Pluronic F-127 solution in a 1:1 volume ratio. The solution
was then sonicated, and the organic solvent was evaporated. The stock
micelle solution of 4 was maintained at 4 °C.

Cell Imaging
For one-photon absorption cell imaging,
3T3 cells (ATCC) were seeded on poly-d-lysine-coated coverslips
at a concentration of 5 × 104 cells/mL and incubated
for 48 h. The micelle solution of dye 4 was then diluted
to 10 μM with minimum essential media (MEM) (Corning, Cellgro)
and added to the cells. The cells were incubated for 30 min and then
fixed with 4% formaldehyde. NaBH4 was added twice at 1
mg/mL for 5 min to reduce autofluorescence. Coverslips were mounted
on slides with ProLong Gold antifade reagent and then imaged using
an Olympus IX70 disk scanning unit microscope fitted with a Texas
Red filter cube.

For 2PFM cell imaging, 3T3 cells were cultured
on 3D scaffolds (Reinnervate, Alvetex) at a concentration of 8 ×
106 cells/mL and incubated for 5 days. The micelle solution
of dye 4 was then diluted to 10 μM with MEM and
added to the cells. The cells were incubated for 2 h and then fixed
with 4% formaldehyde. Scaffolds were mounted on slides with ProLong
Gold antifade reagent and then imaged using a Leica SP5 II microscope
equipped with a Coherent Chameleon Vision S Laser source (prechirped
compensated, 70 fs, 80 MHz) tuned to 800 nm. Scanned images were processed
with Amira for 3D reconstruction.
