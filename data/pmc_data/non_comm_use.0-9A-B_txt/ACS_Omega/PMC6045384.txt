The
objective of the current research was to fabricate and explore
the ability of a renewable resource-based paper strength agent to
enhance fiber–fiber bonding and introduce antibacterial properties
to
recycled fiber paper sheets. The agent corn starch, was modified with
diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid (DTPA), complexed with chitosan,
and added to recycled furnishes to provide a plethora of hydrogen
bonding sites predicated by acid groups, hydroxyls, and amines. The
goal was two-fold: (1) to not only increase interfiber bonding, but
(2) afford antibacterial character. The modified corn starch was characterized
in previous work by thermal gravimetric analysis, differential scanning
calorimeter, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The recycled
pulp slurry was mixed with a ∼1.5% modified starch/chitosan
agent before manufacturing a two-dimensional paper substrate that
was subjected to mechanical testing. The burst, STFI compressive strength,
tensile, and interfiber bonding strength increased 48.8, 49.5, 49.9,
and 176%, respectively, while significantly increased gloss was obtained
despite slightly diminished tear and roughness. The antibacterial
character of these substrates was confirmed by the substrates displaying
a 97% bacteria kill rate.

==== Body
Introduction
Corn starch (CS) is a carbohydrate widely
acknowledged as one of
the most abundant and useful biomaterials on the planet currently
available in a variety of commercial forms. It typically occurs as
a semicrystalline polymer characterized by glucose repeat units in
linear chains composed of ∼25% amylose and 75% amylopectin
by weight.1 It has sundry uses in a number
of industries; in the pulp & paper industry, one is as a paper
dry strength agent. Dry strength agents are multifunctional agents
that not only enhance paper/paperboard mechanical properties such
as burst, compression, and tensile, but also improve drainage and
retention of fiber, fines, and filler. Typically, these agents are
petroleum-derived agents such as derivatized polyacrylamides and,
to a lesser extent, cationized or neat starch.

Starch has a
number of molecular sites for derivatization owing
to the multihydroxyl nature of the glucose ring. However, although
starch is a biobased alternative to the petroleum agents that currently
dominate the market, its ability to enhance mechanical properties
is limited compared to its petroleum counterparts. Nevertheless, chemical
derivatization opportunities, commercial availability, and low cost
are all conducive for the development of more potent starch additives
for paper strength applications.

Chitosan is a polysaccharide
also composed of repeating glucose
residues that, unlike starch, are glucosamine functionalities. More
specifically, an amine functionality instead of a hydroxyl resides
at the C2-position of a glucose ring and thereby provides a number
of functional advantages in addition to hydrogen bonding; this work
focused specifically on its ability to provide antibacterial activity.2,3 At present, chitosan is not known to be used in any operational
sense for papermaking furnishes.

Paper recycling is an important
paradigm to address environmental
concerns and reduce the need for energy and resource-intensive virgin
fiber manufacture. Old corrugated containerboard (OCC), a major component
of the recycled market, cannot be properly recycled without addressing
the physically and chemically compromised fibers. Because it has been
used at least two times, the fibers are hornified, that is, are much
shorter, have reduced numbers of bonding sites, and are consequently
weaker than virgin pulp fibers. Bonding between these shorter fibers
is significantly weaker. OCC pulp fibers also suffer from anionic
trash (dissolved polymeric and colloidal materials) that reduces its
potential as a recycled furnish.4

The United State uses ∼70 million tons of paper and paperboard
per year (2011 MSW Characterization Reports) with a utilization rate
for OCC of ∼92%. However, attempts to improve the strength
of OCC typically result in mechanically inferior products relative
to their virgin equivalents. Some early research identified that chemical
treatments may improve bonding strength.5,6 A number of
innovative studies demonstrated that chemical derivatization of waste
fiber surfaces may prevent strength losses,7,8 while
refining improves mechanical properties.3 The papermaking industry currently uses commercial dry strength
agents that fall under the categories of cationic, anionic, amphoteric
polyacrylamide, glyoxylate polyacrylamide, cationic starch, amphoteric
starch, and carboxyl methyl cellulose, but strength improvement is
still less than desirable relative to virgin pulp.9,10

For decades, a number of studies have been conducted with nonrenewable
petroleum-based additives for several applications including packaging,
a high value sector of the pulp market.11 Increasing environmental concerns led to new biobased packaging
materials based on renewable resources.11 In previous work from the authors, several biobased polymers including
cellulose, soy-based polymers, and chitosan12−14 have been studied.
However, these original approaches determined that having higher polysaccharide
components was much more beneficial for dry strength purposes; therefore,
diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid (DTPA)/CS and DTPA/CS/chitosan
additives comprise the core of this effort and represent a new approach
to upgrade starch despite its ubiquitous nature in the paper industry.
In the present investigation, chemical modification of CS was accomplished
through the incorporation of DTPA and chitosan. This research focuses
on the characterization of newly developed CS/chitosan-treated recycled
OCC pulp sheets by examining interfiber bonding, mechanical, and antibacterial
properties.

Results and Discussion
Characterization of Modified Corn Starch
The carboxylic
acid content of the modified CS increased from 0.0 meq/100 g to 380
meq/100 g. In addition to this measurement after the modification
of CS, the degree of substitution and percent esterification were
determined by titration. The degree of substitution and esterification
percent were found to be 0.28 and 42%, respectively. The molecular
weight was determined by intrinsic viscosity using an Ubbelohde-type
viscometer.18 The molecular weight of CS
and modified CS was found to be 12.96 × 104 and 16.84
× 104 Da, respectively, which is in agreement with
grafting of the functional groups.

Attenuated Total Reflectance
FT-IR Analysis
The attenuated
total reflectance FT-IR (ATR-FTIR) spectra of the CS and modified
corn starch (m-CS) are illustrated in Figure 1. A prominent peak at 3306 cm–1 arises from the hydroxyl groups of CS, whereas no peak was found
over 1720–1800 cm–1, indicating the absence
of carbonyl groups. However, when the CS reacted with DTPA, a peak
was observed at 1740 cm–1 which is attributable
to the carbonyl group of the ester,15 indicating
that DTPA has successfully grafted on to the CS surfaces.

Figure 1 FT-IR spectra
of CS (corn starch) and m-CS (modified corn starch).

Thermal Behavior
The thermogravimetric
(TGA) behavior
of the modified CS is depicted in Figure 2A. The weight loss below and near 100 °C
can be attributed to water evaporation.23 However, weight loss above 100 °C was attributed to thermal
decomposition of the modified CS.24 Both
m-CS and m-CS/Ch showed a lower maximum weight loss temperature. This
is because surface-modifying agents (DTPA) of CS which comprise the
layer on the surface of the CS have a lower decomposition temperature.17,18 The differential thermogravimetry (DTG) curves are shown in Figure 2B. The modified CS
(either m-CS or m-CS/Ch) exhibits a shift in the DTG peak temperature
to lower temperatures, which is consistent with the results observed
in thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) curves. It should be noted that
both m-CS and m-CS/Ch showed significantly higher residual mass. This
was expected and attributed to the cross-linking by DTPA and/or chitosan.
The order in the residue found for each of these three samples verifies
cross-linking. Differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) analysis of
the modified CS is shown in Figure 3. The endothermic peaks for the m-CS and m-CS/Ch were
∼200 °C, whereas the endothermic peak of CS is at 160
°C (Figure 3).
Such increases are due to increased hydrogen and ester bonding in
addition to plasticization arising from esterification.17 By comparing the DSC curves between m-CS and
m-CS/Ch, the latter peak is sharper, a finding attributed to more
hydrogen bonding introduced by the amino groups in chitosan.

starch, m-CS = modified corn starch, and m-CS/Ch = modified corn starch/chitosan).

Application of m-CS/Ch
Effect
of m-CS/Ch on Paper Strength Properties
Physical
strength is one of the most important properties of paper substrates.
These substrates must offer sufficient resistance to ensure high quality
packaging, sealing, or wrapping applications. Typically, this gross
resistance is attributed at the molecular level to adequate development
of hydrogen bonds. After recycling, pulp fibers are irreversibly damaged,
which affect final pulp strength properties. Figure 4 shows the tensile strength of recycled pulp
sheet resulting after the addition of m-CS and m-CS/Ch.

m-CS = modified corn starch, and CS = corn starch).

Figure 4 Effects of CS (corn starch) and m-CS/Ch (modified corn
starch/chitosan)
on the tensile index of the recycled pulp.

The control sample was prepared from recycled pulp (CSF or
Canadian
Standard Freeness = 400). In tandem, a 1.5% modified CS/chitosan additive
(on dry pulp weight) was mixed with the recycled pulp slurry. The
tensile index of the 1.5% CS, 1.5% m-CS/Ch-treated recycled pulp sheet
was 8.2 and 49.9% higher than the control pulp sheet. Similarly, the
burst index and STFI compressive strength index increased by 15.0
and 48.8%, respectively, and 11.0 and 49.5%, respectively, compared
to the control (Figures 5 and 6). The tear index of 1.5% m-CS-/Ch-treated
recycled pulp sheet decreased, but only 1.5% CS-treated recycled pulp
sheet slightly increased compared to the control (Figure 7).

on the STFI compressive strength indices of OCC recycled pulp sheets.

Figure 7 Effect of CS (corn starch) and m-CS/Ch (modified

on the tear indices of OCC recycled pulps.

The interfiber bonding strength of the recycled pulp sheet
(control)
and additive-treated pulp sheets were measured by an Internal Bond
Tester (Scott). The interfiber bonding strength increased by 176%
for 1.5% m-CS-/Ch-treated recycled pulp sheet compared to the control
recycled paper sheet. This may be due to ester and amide bond formations
between the pulp fibers and CS derivatives.24−27

A high residual char was
observed from 1.5% m-CS-/Ch-treated recycled
pulp sheet compared to the control recycled paper sheet after heating
to 600 °C (Figure 8) which indicates that the modified CS/chitosan is cross-linking
to the pulp fibers.28

of (A) OCC pulp sheet and (B) m-CS-/Ch-(modified
corn starch/chitosan) treated OCC pulp sheet.

Dynamic Contact Angle of m-CS-/Ch-Treated Pulp Sheets
The dynamic contact angle was determined to be 45° at 20 s for
the OCC paper sheet (control). The water angle for the OCC paper sheet
was significantly reduced to 4.5° at 200 s (Figure 9). In contrast, the dynamic
contact angle for 1.5% m-CS-/Ch-treated OCC paper sheet was 102°
at 20 s that dropped to 80° at 400 s, to 75° at 2200 s,
and finally dropped to 45° at 2800 s. This may be because the
m-CS/Ch additive contains chitosan that is strongly hydrophobic, producing
a sticky gel under acidic pH conditions that adopts a plastic-like
character under dry conditions.

m-CS-/Ch- (modified CS/chitosan)
treated OCC pulp sheets.

Antimicrobial Activity of m-CS-/Ch-Treated Pulp Sheets
The antimicrobial activity of different materials was tested according
to the AATCC 147 test method. Figure 10 shows that unmodified CS significantly supported bacteria
colony growth, but no bacteria or bacteria colony was observed for
modified CS/chitosan. The nutritious properties of CS significantly
promote bacteria growth versus modified CS/chitosan whose positively
charged chitosan amine group likely plays a significant role in killing
97% of the bacteria.29 The less than 100%
killing rate observed for the modified CS/chitosan sample may likely
be due to incomplete exposure of the active bactericidal chitosan
amine unit of the dry strength agent due to complexation with the
acid functionalities of the DTPA and its reduced overall abundance
in the composite system.

starch), m-SC/Ch
(modified corn starch/chitosan), and m-CS-/Ch (modified corn starch/chitosan
additive)-treated OCC pulp sheets.

Conclusions
CS was modified with
DTPA to increase the functionality of CS that
leads to an enhancement of fiber–fiber bond formation in recycled
pulp fibers. It was confirmed that carboxyl group content significantly
increased. The modified CS was further coupled with chitosan to improve
antimicrobial properties as well as increase interfiber bonding. The
pulp slurry was blended with ∼1.5% CS and related derivatives
(m-CS and m-CS/Ch) before making a pulp sheet. The mechanical properties
including tensile, burst, and STFI compressive strength index all
increased by 8.2 and 49.9%, 15.0 and 48.8%, and 11.0 and 49.5%, respectively,
whereas the interfiber bonding strength of m-CS-/Ch-treated pulp sheet
increased 176%, in addition to a two-fold increase in gloss and 20%
decrease in roughness. The antimicrobial activity of the CS derivative-treated
pulp sheets was significantly increased as observed by the kill rate
of ∼97% of the bacteria.

Experimental Section
Materials
CS was supplied by Cargill Incorporated,
Minneapolis, MN. The recycled pulp was supplied by Georgia Pacific,
Atlanta, GA. Chemicals of reagent grade utilized were sodium hypophosphate
(SHP), CAS registry number 123333-67-5, sodium hydroxide (NaOH), CAS
registry number 1310-73-2, DTPA, CAS no. 67-43-6, and acetic acid,
all of which were purchased from Fisher Scientific. Chitosan (Ch),
CAS no. 9012-76-4, was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Deionized water
was used for all experiments.

Modification of CS
CS (8 g) was boiled at 100 °C
for 15 min and combined with 20 mL of solution of 2 g of DTPA and
0.4 g SHP in a 50 mL Petri dish and mixed vigorously with a glass
rod. The mixture was placed in an air oven at 120 °C for 3 h,
washed with DI water, and filtered several times to remove unreacted
materials. The m-CS was air-dried at 50 °C in an air oven overnight.15 The reaction scheme is shown in Figure 11.

Complexation Reaction
Approximately 0.5 g Ch was dissolved
into 50 mL of 1% acetic acid solution and added to a 50 mL solution
of 1.2 g m-CS in a 250 mL round-bottom flask. The mixture was magnetically
stirred at 80 °C for 90 min.16 The
reaction scheme is depicted in Figure 12. The resultant material is denoted as m-CS/Ch.

Preparation of the Paper Sheet
The paper sheet was
prepared according to TAPPI Standard Method 205. In general, the additives
(CS or modified-CS) were blended with the pulp slurry followed by
pouring into the hand sheet molding machine. Water was further mixed
with the pulp slurry and agitated a couple of times before drainage.
The amounts of CS and modified-CS were 1.5 wt %. No white water was
collected from the hand sheet molding machine because of the lack
of adequate instrumentation systems.

Testing Methods
Determination
of Carboxyl Content
m-CS was dissolved
in water and hydrolyzed with 0.1 N NaOH for 1 h. The excess amount
of NaOH in m-CS solution was determined by titration with 0.1 N HCl
using phenolphthalein as an indicator;17 and the carboxylic acid content in milliequivalents of acidity per
100 g was reported as follows  where W = weight of sample, N = normality of
HCl, V1 = volume
of HCl with sample, and V2 = volume of
HCl without sample.

Determination of the Degree of Substitution
and Degree of Esterification
The m-CS was dissolved in DMSO
to which 0.1 N NaOH was added to
saponify the ester over 2 h. The unreacted NaOH was determined by
titration with 0.1 N HCl.18,19 The percent esterification
and the degree of substitution were determined according to following
equation.  where N = normality of HCl, V1 = volume
of HCl with the sample, and V2 = volume
of HCl without the sample  where A % = degree of esterification, W = weight of sample, M = molecular weight
of crosslinking agent, and m = molecular weight of
the cross-linking part of the cross-linking agent.

Physical Properties
of m-CS-/Ch-Treated Recycled Paper Sheets
The STFI compressive
strength, burst, tensile, tear, roughness,
and gloss of m-CS-treated recycled paper sheet were measured according
to TAPPI T 826, TAPPI T 810, TAPPI T 220, TAPPI T 414, TAPPI T 538,
and TAPPI T 480 test methods, respectively. The interfiber bonding
strength of m-CS-/chitosan-treated recycled paper sheets was determined
using a standard T 569 pm-00 (provisional method TAPPI 2000). For
all runs, five samples were tested.

Characterization
ATR-FTIR
Analysis
ATR-FTIR spectra of m-CS/chitosan
were recorded using a PerkinElmer FT-IR spectrophotometer.20

Thermal Gravimetric Analysis
TGA
(TA, Q500) was used
for the thermogravimetric analysis of the sample in nitrogen atmosphere.
The temperature range and the heating rate were 30–600 °C
and 5 °C/min, respectively.21

Differential
Scanning Calorimeter
DSC (TA, Q100) was
used with a hermetic pan (T 090127) for analysis. The temperature
range and the heating rate were 40–240 °C and 2 °C/min,
respectively. An empty pan was used as given in ref (22).

Contact Angle
Dynamic contact angles of m-CS-/Ch-treated
recycled paper sheets were obtained by a Phoenix 300 contact angle
analyzer. Deionized water was used as the probe fluid.17

Antimicrobial Activity Test of m-CS and m-CS-/Ch-Treated
Recycled
Paper Sheets
The AATCC 147 test method was used to test the
antimicrobial activity of unmodified and m-CS-/Ch-treated OCC pulp
sheets. Escherichia coli bacteria suspensions
were inoculated into the peptone liquid. An air bath shaker was used
for incubation at 37.8 °C for 12 h, and the culture broth was
diluted. The peptone culture plates were prepared with mixtures of
the bacteria suspension, CS, m-CS/Ch, and m-CS-/Ch-treated OCC pulp
sheet separately. A blank was also prepared for comparison. The plates
were incubated at 37.8 °C for 24 h, and the inhibition rate was
calculated according to the equation below  where A and B represent the number of colonies
on the plates before and after
inhibition.
