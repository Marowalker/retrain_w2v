During
the early stages of β amyloid (Ab) peptide aggregation, toxic
oligomers form which have been recognized as a likely cause of Alzheimer’s
disease. In this work, we use fully atomistic molecular dynamics simulation
to study the amorphous aggregation of the peptide as well as model
β-sheet protofibril structures. In particular, we study the
rotamer states of the single fluorescent tyrosine (Tyr) residue present
in each Ab. We find that the occupation of the four previously identified
rotamers is different for monomeric and amorphous aggregates because
of the differing environments of the Tyr side-chains. Surprisingly,
we also identify two new rotamers that uniquely appear for the β-sheet
structures, so that together the rotamers provide distinct signatures
for the different stages of aggregation and fibrillation. We propose
that these rotamers could be identified in fluorescence spectroscopy,
with each rotamer having a distinct fluorescence lifetime because
of its different exposures to the solvent. The identification of the
two new rotamers therefore provides a new means to probe amyloid formation
kinetics and to monitor the effect of additives including prospective
drugs.

==== Body
Introduction
Because of advances
in the medical field, the average life expectancy of the population
of many countries is increasing every year and, consequently, the
global population affected by amyloid-related diseases has also been
increasing.1,2 Amyloid-related diseases occur when certain
proteins, naturally found in the body, stop functioning correctly
and begin to rapidly aggregate forming large β-sheet plaques.
During the aggregation phase, extreme cellular degeneration occurs,
most likely at the oligomer stage of aggregation,3 leading to diseases such as Alzheimer’s, type-2
diabetes and Lewy body myositis. The malfunctioning proteins appear
to differ for each disease.1,4,5 These proteins all form β-sheet fibrils; in the case of Alzheimer’s,
the fibrils are deposited in the brain and in type-2 diabetes, they
are deposited in the pancreas.4 This paper
focuses on the β amyloid (Ab) peptide that is associated with
Alzheimer’s disease.

The natural function of Ab peptide
is not fully understood, and there is no apparent change to (or loss
of) physiological functions in animals that have the Ab peptide missing.6−8 However, some potential explanations for the role of Ab in vivo
have been proposed by various researchers; Bogoyevitch et al.9 showed that it could be a requirement for kinase
enzyme activation, and this has been supplemented by further work
in the area.10 It may also be related to
oxidative stress protection,11,12 cholesterol transport
regulation,13,14 the prevention of microbial activity,15 or play a role as a transcription factor.16,17 Regardless, the Ab peptides eventually stop functioning correctly
and begin to aggregate, creating the toxic oligomer stage that contributes
to the disease development.

Despite the significant interest
in the research community, there are many aspects of the aggregation
process that require better understanding to inform strategies to
prevent or modify the aggregation. Experimentally, in vitro techniques
can be used to study the aggregation; however, it is difficult to
determine the fibril nucleation events that occur on the molecular
level. This makes obtaining a detailed understanding of aggregation
pathways impossible using one method alone.

Ab is a small protein
(or peptide, with 36–43 amino acids) that contains a single
tyrosine (Tyr) residue,18 which allows
fluorescence measurements to be used to monitor Ab aggregation in
vitro. The change in fluorescence decays over time observed in these
experiments is due to the environmental changes of the Tyr residues
and so can be used to infer the temporal progression of the aggregation.19 The literature shows that starting with dispersed
monomeric Ab peptide at high concentration, there is a clear lag phase
where no aggregate growth occurs, followed by a rapid formation of
long mature fibrils containing a backbone held by hydrogen bonding
in the form of β-sheets. Previous research using fluorescence
spectroscopy also shows that the Tyr side-chain goes through rapid
changes during the initial stages of aggregation, but very quickly
stabilises.20 This is then followed by
the rapid growth phase where fluorescence dye spectroscopy reveals
the rapid formation of β-sheets.21 Once aggregation occurs, the lifetimes associated with the Tyr side-chains
also change, reflecting the new Tyr environments (named rotamer states)
not found in the monomer form of Ab.

Though the changes to the
fluorescence responses can be measured, understanding how and why
these changes occur is not clear through experimentation alone. The
work in this paper describes fully atomistic molecular dynamic (MD)
simulations, where the primary focus is to observe the effects of
differing local environments on the Tyr residues and their resultant
conformations. In the previous work, we have shown how MD simulation
can help interpret fluorescence anisotropy experiments monitoring
Ab aggregation.22 In this study, we reveal
new rotamer states that seem to be uniquely associated with fibril
structures and absent from monomer or amorphous aggregates. These
new rotamers are expected to have their own fluorescence lifetimes
because each rotamer exposes the fluorescent side-chains to solvent
in a different way. Therefore, our results offer the potential for
a new fluorescence spectroscopy feature that can directly monitor
fibril nucleation, as opposed to amorphous aggregation, without the
need for external labeling with fluorescent dyes. A capability to
monitor the formation pathway of the fibrils (monomers to oligomer
to fibril) in vitro, and potentially also in vivo, would not only
provide new scientific insight but also help in the search for inhibitors
to prevent aggregation or for incipients to promote fibril formation
from the toxic oligomers.

Materials and Methods
Fully atomistic
MD simulations of Ab1–42 systems were performed
in this work. All simulations were performed using NAMD 2.823 and the Charmm27 force field, with VMD24 employed to prepare the simulations, visualize
the results, and track the orientation of the tyrosine residues. Standard
Charmm27 protonation states have been used, and stability tests for
single Ab1–42 peptides in a NaCl solution show no
tendency for abnormal folding; additional data are provided in the Supporting Information. The first set of simulations
used monomers and amorphous aggregates, which were created using an
NMR structure of Ab1–42 (1iyt.pdb) taken from the protein data bank
and obtained by Crescenzi et al.25 These
systems were compared to potential protofibril structures found by
Wälti et al. (2nao.pdb),26 using solvent (water) with both
zero and physiologically relevant bulk iconicity.

The 1iyt.pdb structure was
copied as required for the various aggregation simulations, and the
Ab1–42 peptides were positioned with an adequate
distance between them to ensure they aggregated in a natural manner
during the simulations. Generally, there was at least 12 Å between
peptides at the start of the simulations, except when trying to promote
aggregation; in the small water-box three-peptide system (which despite
this, only formed a dimer), the starting distance between peptides
was 7 Å. These (and the 2nao systems) were then solvated using a TIP3P water model
with adequately sized rectangular water boxes, ∼90 Å ×
94 Å × 87 Å for the system with excess ions (EI) and
∼72 Å × 99 Å × 87 Å for the system
without EIs (NEI). The EI system is understood as a Ab1–42 system with counterions neutralizing the system and some additional
Na+/Cl– ions to achieve the desired ionic
concentration, whereas the system without EIs (NEIs) is one with Ab1–42 neutralized only and no extra ions added. We study
two simulations with Na+ and Cl– ions
added to mimic the ionic concentration of blood, ∼0.15 mol/L;27 the first is a nonaggregating three monomer
system, and the second is a hexamer protofibril.

A water minimization
stage (1000 steps) 100 ps of water equilibration was performed on
each of these systems. The Langevin piston control pressure was activated
with group-based pressure control, a piston temperature of 300 K,
and anisotropic cell fluctuations as in previous work.28 A minimization phase followed (10 000
steps), before a 30 ps period of heating to 300 K for amorphous systems
or 310 K (body temperature) for the fibril-like systems, both to a
pressure of 1 atm. The final thermal equilibration required 270 ps,
with a time-step of 1 fs. The production trajectories were performed
with a time-step of 2 fs, at 300 K (or 310 K) in the NVT ensemble. The trajectory time varies from 50 to 200 ns depending
on the system studied. Although this is a relatively short simulation
time, the early events in the oligomerization process, which are in
focus of this work, are captured. The SHAKE algorithm and periodic
boundary conditions were employed. van der Waals (vdW) interactions
had a cutoff of 12 Å, and PME is used for the electrostatics.

The tyrosine (Tyr) residue within each Ab1–42 peptide was tracked using VMD to obtain the Tyr rotamer states (preferred
orientations). This follows previous work, which showed that the Tyr
residues rotate along the Cα–Cβ and the Cβ–Cγ bonds.28 These angles were tracked for each “frame”
of the trajectory (every 20 000 integration steps) by using
the dihedral angles along the sets of atoms C–Cα–Cβ–Cγ and Cα–Cβ–Cγ–CD1, which we label angles X1 and X2 respectively, as shown
in Figure 1A. In this
work, each frame of the analyzed trajectory depicts a passage of 0.04
ns; this is chosen to avoid oversampling the THz molecular vibrations.

Figure 1 (A) Dihedral
angles Cα–Cβ and Cβ–Cγ used in this work, following ref (28). (B) Dihedral angle quadrants
used to identify the rotamer states. X1 and X2 angle conformations (g+, g–,
and t) are indicated.29 (C) VMD images
of the six rotamer states.

At each frame, the dihedral angles are plotted to show the
preferred orientations (i.e., rotamer states) of the Tyr residues.
We use the range 0°–360° to denote the angles (as
opposed to −180° to 180°) for clarity of presentation.
In these plots, we are able to distinguish the states by splitting
the X1 – X2 plane into six zones, as illustrated in Figure 1B. The X2 angle is divided into two equal sections, and X1 into three. This allows us to quickly and unambiguously
identify 6 possible rotamer states (see below for verification that
this assignment is consistent with the full set of results obtained
in this study). The six rotamer states are illustrated in Figure 1C.

It should
be noted that the previous work had only shown the presence of the
first four rotamer states,28 and the work
presented in this paper revealed that the fifth and sixth rotamer
states become occupied in the protofibril structures (see Figure 1C). This suggests
that they would also appear in larger structures such as amyloid fibrils
(see results below). We note that because of the lack of symmetry
along the peptide backbone and the unique sequence of the peptide,
the rotamer states 5 and 6 are distinct and different to the other
states.

Results
Ab1–42 Amorphous Aggregation
We aim to characterize the rotamer states, their occupancy, and
the transition pathways between them in various small oligomers. We
are also interested in how the oligomers form, and whether this influences
the rotamer statistics. Therefore, we undertake a series of simulations
for the following systems:Monomers
with EIs and without (NEI);

Dimers in
ionic solutions (EI); and

A tetramer
in an ionic solution (EI).



The aggregation
simulations allow the oligomers to form in a natural way, simulating
the oligomerization that can occur experimentally as monomers diffuse
freely through the solution.

Monomers in Ionic Solution
Figure 2 shows results of
simulations with three peptides diffusing in a small water box with
an ionic concentration of 0.15 mol/L (EI system). The extent of the
water box is illustrated by the ions in Figure 2A,B (the water is not shown for clarity).
The dimensions of Ab1–42 monomers when in a stable
folded conformation is ∼25 Å × 24 Å × 10
Å, and the water box is of size ∼83 Å × 87 Å
× 102 Å. Despite the crowded environment, in this simulation,
the monomers do not appear to be interacting with one another. This
suggests that aggregation (i.e., the formation of close contacts between
peptides) does not occur readily and that perhaps something must initiate
it, such as misfolding,30 which has been
observed in other trajectories below.

Figure 2 Three-monomer system in an ionic solution
(EI): at trajectory time = 0 ns (A) and after 50 ns (B) with peptide
A shown in blue, peptide B shown in red, and peptide C shown in gray.
The vdW spheres of the ions are shown in gray and Tyr residues are
shown in green. In (C), the left-hand graph shows the plots of X1 against X2 and
the right-hand graph shows the rotamer states of peptide A’s
Tyr residue at each frame, with transitions indicated by the blue
lines.

The proteins begin close together
and yet remain independent with little interaction with one another
throughout the trajectory. The changes to the peptides’ conformations
during this trajectory are minimal, as seen in Figure 2B. The heads (low-index residues at the N-terminus)
and tails (high index at the C-terminus) of the peptides appear to
unravel in a manner similar to that found in the literature,31 and the helix sections32,33 are focused around residues 11–22 and 32–36 in all
three peptides. This creates the initial “L”-shape of
the peptides which might eventually lead to the formation of an antiparallel
β-sheet structure (or hairpin motif).32

The rotamer states are identified by tracking the two dihedral
angles of the Tyr residues, and results for Tyr A are shown in Figure 2C. This clearly shows
the rotamer states 1, 2, 3, and 4 (see Figure 1B) occupied by the Tyr side-chain throughout
the trajectory. The rotamers 1–4 for Tyr A are approximately
centered around the (X1;X2) angles (in degrees) of (67;239), (74;81), (166;116),
and (168;291), respectively. We find similar rotamers for Tyr B at
approximately (66;239), (72;108), (112;164), (166;277), and (290;170),
and for Tyr C at approximately (69;270), (73;67), (168;117), and (166;305).
A full list of the rotamer centers found in all our simulations is
provided in the Supporting Information.

Because the three monomers are relatively unhindered by their surroundings
and appear to diffuse freely, their rotamer state occupancies are
all similar. As long as they are folded into stable conformations,
they appear to show a distinct preference for states 1 and 2. It can
also be noted that there is more frequent movement between states
3 and 4 than in state 2, showing that the Tyr does not find states
3 and 4 favorable for long periods of time in the monomeric peptide.
Moreover, Tyr side-chain transitions between the rotamers tend to
appear in a cyclic fashion. Transitions observed are 1 ↔ 2,
2 ↔ 3, 3 ↔ 4, and 4 ↔ 1. This is associated with
the proximity of the rotamer states illustrated in Figure 1C.

In order to verify
these findings, we have studied many monomer systems for both Ab1–42 and some Ab1–40 systems (see
the Supporting Information). In the case
of Ab1–42, we have studied two other systems. The
first is a three monomer system with no EIs (NEI), and the second
(also NEI) contains a monomer and a dimer. These provided a comparison
to assess the effect of the screening ions on the Tyr rotamer state
occupation and movements.

The results (shown in the Supporting Information) indicate that a visibly
more stable conformation is found when the solution ions are present
(the EI system). However, we do not attempt to quantify the conformations
because all of the amorphous structures are prone to fluctuations
as we might expect for small peptides and oligomers. The Tyr side-chains
always have a preference toward occupation of states 1 and 2, with
a relatively lower population of states 3 and 4, regardless of the
presence of the ions. The only exceptions we have observed in the “monomeric”
systems were instances of occupation of states 3 and 4 only (or in
sometimes only one of these states). However, in these cases, the
results can be explained by the close proximity of the Tyr side-chain
to surrounding residues or to the backbone of another peptide, preventing
free movement between rotamer states, and thus explaining the discrepancy
with truly free monomer behavior.

Ab1–42 Dimers
A 50 ns trajectory containing four monomers (NEI)
that then formed two dimers is illustrated in Figure 3. The water box containing the peptides is
∼73 Å × 99 Å × 90 Å, which ensures
that no cross-boundary interactions occur between a peptide’s
head and tail because of the periodicity, because the dimensions of
the Ab1–42 monomers (stated previously) are significantly
smaller than the total size of the water box.

Figure 3 Two-dimer system at time
= 0, 20, and 50 ns. Peptide A is shown in blue, peptide B in red,
peptide C in gray, and peptide D in orange. The gray vdW spheres for
the atoms illustrate the protein surfaces and the Tyr residues are
shown in green.

The initial stages of
the trajectory have the four monomers relatively close in proximity.
The misfolding or conformational changes shown here are more significant
than those seen in the previous monomer systems, which could explain
why this system more readily aggregates.26,31 Monomers C and D start interacting fairly early and form a dimer
by around 20 ns, whereas monomer A moves down, passes through the
bottom of the water-box, wraps around to the top of the water-box
(due to the periodicity), and begins to interact with monomer B at
approximately 37.5 ns. The last 12.5 ns of the trajectory contains
two dimers, which predominantly have alpha helix structures.32,33 The only caveat is that once peptide B begins to aggregate, its
alpha helix coil becomes significantly shorter than that in the other
peptides for brief periods, changes that have been seen elsewhere.31

The trends in Figure 4 are repeatedly observed in our Ab aggregating
simulations. Peptides A and B spend most of the trajectory as monomers,
which is reflected in their Tyr rotamer data. They spend the majority
of the early stages in states 1 and 2, as has been shown to be the
preference for monomers. They then show substantial occupation of
states 3 and 4 from around frame 800 (32 ns), which is the time they
begin interacting closely to form a stable aggregate soon after (at
37.5 ns). This further suggests that there is an occupational preference
of states 1 and 2 when in the monomer form and states 3 and 4 when
in an amorphous aggregate because of the more crowded environment.

Figure 4 Dimer
rotamer states. In each panel, the left graph plots the dihedral angle X1 against X2, and
the right graph shows how the Tyr residues move between the rotamer
states. (A–D) Peptides A–D, respectively.

This pattern is also shown by peptides C and D
that aggregate fairly early in the trajectory; there is a rapid shift
toward states 3 and 4, with some random fluctuations as might be expected.
Tyr C’s preference for state 1 near the end of the trajectory
suggests that it has become constrained by its surroundings.

Ab1–42 Tetramer
A short 30 ns simulation containing
six monomers (NEI) is shown in Figure 5. It begins to form an amorphous aggregate early on
in the trajectory because of the relatively small water-box surrounding
the peptides (dimensions ∼72 Å × 99 Å ×
87 Å), revealing information about the how the Tyr side-chains
are affected by their immediate environment.

Figure 5 Six-monomer system aggregating
to an amorphous tetramer and a dimer, at times 0 (A), 20 (B), and
30 ns (C). Peptides A–F are shown in blue, red, gray, orange,
yellow, and tan, respectively. Tyr residues are shown in green.

In Figure 5, the monomers are seen to aggregate within
a few nanosecond. This is different from previous simulations, driven
by their close proximity which also seems to promote monomer misfolding.32,34 The antiparallel β-sheets that form between the head and tail
of peptide D (folding over on itself to do this) and the head of peptide
B (the head creates a small hairpin motif)28 are also visible by the end of the trajectory. Other than this all
peptides share the features of a helical structure.33

Monomers A and B begin to aggregate together forming
a dimer and monomers C through F begin to form a tetramer during the
first 4.8 ns. By 7.2 ns, it appears that all six peptides are interacting
and show signs of beginning to form an amorphous hexamer. However,
at 26.4 ns, peptides D and F break away from the aggregate as a dimer
and peptides A, B, C, and E remain as a tetramer for the remainder
of the trajectory. We will now focus on the behavior of the Try residues
in these four peptides that make this tetramer.

Despite the
short duration of this simulation, we obtain informative data about
the rotamer states at the early stages of the oligomerization process,
as shown in Figure 6. Tyr A is mostly unaffected by its surroundings and shows a distinct
preference to states 1 and 2 similar to the behavior of some monomers.
Tyr B spends much of the trajectory with freedom to move, but does
interact with the aggregate at ∼20 ns, which is reflected in
a short-lived occupation of states 3 and 4 at around 20 ns (frame
500 in Figure 6), which
further suggests that states 3 and 4 are occupied when local interactions
affect (but do not trap) the Tyr side-chain. Tyr C has similar results
with some occupation of states 3 and 4 most likely associated with
closeness of the neighboring residues and surrounding aggregate. Tyr
E shows a preference to states 3 and 4 influenced by the close interactions
of its neighboring residues and perhaps also the proximity to peptide
C.

Figure 6 Tetramer rotamer states. In each panel, the left graph plots the
dihedral angle X1 against X2, and the right graph shows how the Tyr residues move
between the rotamer states. (A–D) Peptides A, B, C, and E,
respectively.

From this, it is notable
that once aggregated, these Tyr residues have a tendency to prefer
states 3 and 4, behavior observed above for the dimers. However, this
phenomenon is not universally true because of the random nature of
the amorphous aggregation process that determines the immediate environment
of the Tyr residues.

Ab1–42 Protofibril Systems
We now aim to contrast the rotamer state statistics of the amorphous
oligomers to those observed in a model protofibril structure. Specifically,
we characterize the rotamer behavior in the following systems:Protofibril hexamer without EIs (NEI);
and

Protofibril hexamer with EIs.



Hexamer without EIs in Solution (NEI)
The final type of system discussed in this paper (in comparison with
the monomer and amorphous aggregate systems) is the protofibril hexamer
structure (both EI and NEI systems) shown in Figure 7 which has been created from 2nao.pdb.26 Here, the individual peptides have unravelled,
losing their helical structure, and have formed strong β-sheet
bonds. It has been proposed that this is the basic building block
required in the formation of fibrils. The peptides in this hexamer
have a very different structure to those in the amorphous aggregates
discussed above, and as we will show, this causes changes to the Tyr
rotamer statistics.

Figure 7 (A) Initial configuration of a stable protofibril hexamer,
with water shown to indicate the water-box size. (B) β-sheet
hexamer without screening ions (NEI system) depicted at time 200 ns.
(C) β-sheet hexamer in 0.25 mol/L ionic solution (EI system)
depicted at time 110 ns. Peptides A–F are shown in blue, red,
gray, orange, yellow, and tan, respectively. The ions are shown as
gray vdW spheres and the Tyr residues are shown in green.

In the simulated structure, the hexamer has dimensions
∼84 Å × 52 Å × 14 Å and the overall
water-box size is large enough (∼90 Å × 94 Å
× 87 Å) to ensure that there is no aggregation artificially
induced by the periodic boundaries, although there could be some long-range
interactions affecting the Tyr side-chain movements. A larger water-box
would be beneficial, but the increased size of the calculation would
increase the computational costs.

This trajectory starts with
the protofibril in a configuration found from NMR experimentation
(see Figure 7A) and
therefore should be stable. However, as the NEI trajectory begins,
the backbone regions around the Tyr side-chains of peptides D, E,
and F spread apart, whereas A, B, and C remain rigid and relatively
close together. After 20 ns, there are some significant conformational
changes visible near the head of the peptides in the stack containing
peptides A–C. In contrast, the changes seen for peptides D–F
are less significant. By 40 ns, the structure has moved further from
the original conformational shape, with a lot of the β-sheet
sections beginning to shift, but it can still be identified as a hexamer
protofibril. After 60 ns, the stacked portion containing peptides
A–C is further misshapen but its β-sheet structuring
has mostly remained intact and the stack containing D–F remains
relatively structured throughout. After 100 ns, the aggregate maintains
the structure it has at that point for approximately 30 ns and then
the middle sections of the peptides’ backbones spread out again.

As apparent in Figure 7B, by the end of the NEI simulation, the backbones of the
peptides are not aggregated as rigidly as might be expected and they
are further apart in the middle of the structure than they were at
the start of the trajectory. It should also be noted that Tyr E (in
the middle layer of one side of the hexamer stack) has significantly
more room to move than the equivalent Tyr B in the other side of the
hexamer.

The final structure of the system is as follows: peptides
A, B, and C have parallel β-sheets formed between Ile31–Val36
and Val39–Val40. Peptides A and B also have a β-sheet
between Glu3–Arg5, which was lost in C. Furthermore, the initial
β-sheets in the mid-section of these peptides have disappeared,
which is why the mid-sections spread apart as discussed above. Peptides
D, E, and F remain structured throughout, with β-sheets around
residues Phe4–Hsd6, Gln15–Phe20, and Ile31–Val36;
it has been seen in other trajectories which only contained, for example,
peptides A–C structured in a manner similar to those seen in
this hexamer. E and F also contain a β sheet at the tail around
Val39–Val40. The lack of stability might be caused by the low
ion count in the system, so that long-range screening effects are
missing. This becomes more apparent when we compare to the same system
simulated in an ionic solution (EI) as discussed below.

The
rotamer states for peptides A, C, E, and F from the EI simulation
are shown in Figure 8. For these fibril structures, there is a more significant shift
toward rotamer states 3 and 4 with respect to the amorphous aggregates,
as well as the occupation of states 5 and 6. There are exceptions
however; Tyr D’s environment is more akin to that of a monomer
than an aggregate, and similarly Tyr E’s side-chain moves quite
freely and spends about 25% of its time in states 1 and 2 (see Figure 8C). These variations
are expected because of the stochastic nature of the simulations.

Figure 8 Sample
results of protofibril hexamer rotamers with (EI) and without ions
(NEI) in solution. In each panel, the left graphs show the dihedral
angle X1 against the dihedral angle X2, and the right graphs show how the Tyr residues
move between the rotamer states. (A–C) Peptides A–C,
respectively, in NEI systems, whereas (D–F) show peptides F,
D, and E, respectively, in EI systems.

Nevertheless, there does seem to be a more distinct feature
arising in the rotamer statistics. The most notable difference between
this protofibril and the previous simulations is the appearance of
rotamer states 5 and 6 in peptides A, C, E, and F. Despite not being
seen previously, it is evident that these are distinct states that
can be occupied at different points throughout the trajectory, with
finite probabilities of occurring.

As there is a recurring pattern
of the Tyr side-chains moving between states in an ordered fashion
(from 1 ↔ 2, 2 ↔ 3, 3 ↔ 4, and so on), it is
reasonable to suppose that the sudden appearance of states 5 and 6
could be enabled by a Tyr side-chain spending more time in states
3 and 4, causing it to have a higher probability of transitioning
from state 4 into state 5 or 6. Another likely reason for the appearance
of these new states may be the close proximity of the surrounding
residues forcing the Tyr side-chain to flex and rotate more aggressively,
allowing it to enter otherwise unfavorable states 5 and 6.

Hexamer
in Ionic Solution (EI)
As can be seen above, the hexamer
structure shown in Figure 7C is similar to that of Figure 7B. The inclusion of an ionic concentration of 0.25
mol/L (EI) is the only difference in the simulations; nevertheless,
visual inspection of the trajectory indicates that long-range screening
effects35 might lead to the development
of more stable form of the oligomer. The water-box size is similar
to that used previously (∼92 Å × 95 Å ×
90 Å) which is big enough for the hexamer. This trajectory was
also performed for 200 ns, but as there was no real change in structure
after the first 110 ns, we show the structure at this time in Figure 7C.

The trajectory
begins in the same structure as above (Figure 7A). The structure remains relatively unchanged
for the first 10 ns, but with some minor twisting near the head of
the stack containing peptides A–C. After 40 ns, the overall
hexamer structure remains relatively unchanged, except some noticeable
twisting of the mid-section of both stacks. Nothing of interest occurs
until 70 ns where Tyr A and D appear to gain some freedom and move
around more freely, though the aggregate itself remains significantly
more stable throughout the 200 ns trajectory than all previous aggregates.
Throughout the trajectory, the β-sheet sections holding the
peptides together shift and move, but the aggregate is significantly
more stable than seen above. Peptides A and B have β-sheet sections
within the regions of Glu3–Arg5, Gln15–Phe20, Ile31–Gly33,
and Gly38–Ile41. Peptide C has β-sheet sections in similar
positions, however as it is not as tightly aggregated it has some
variation (Gln15–Leu17 rather than Gln15–Phe20). Peptides
D and E have β-sheet regions at Glu3–Arg5, Lys16–Val18,
Ala30–Val36, and Val39–Ile41. Peptide F also has them
in these locations, except at the head (Glu3–Arg5) which has
separated itself from the other two peptides.

The rotamer states
for Tyr A, B, C, and F in this trajectory show an overwhelming preferences
toward states 3 and 4, but do not enter states 5 or 6 at all. Tyr
D not only shows a distinct preference to states 3 and 4 but also
temporarily enters states 5 and 6, as shown in Figure 8E. Tyr E (shown in Figure 8F) also enters states 5 and 6 briefly at
the start of the trajectory.

Rotamer State Summary
Figure 9 presents
the angles obtained for the six rotamers identified in the simulations
above; further details are given in Supporting Information Table S1. Rotamer 1 is centered (has mean coordinates)
at (X1;X2)
= (71;265) which, according to the definition introduced in Figure 1, is equivalent to
(g+;g+); rotamer 2 is centered at (X1;X2) = (72;76) = (g+;g+); rotamer 3 at (X1;X2) = (165;92)
= (t;g−); rotamer 4 at (X1;X2) = (166;270) = (t;g+/g−); rotamer 5
at (X1;X2) = (285;80) = (g–;g+);
and rotamer 6 at (X1;X2) = (285;265) = (g–;g+). The range of the angular
variation for each rotamer depends on the immediate environment of
the Tyr side-chain. Despite the outliers caused by statistical fluctuations,
there is consistency in the general areas occupied by the rotamers,
regardless of aggregate type (monomer, amorphous, or proto-fibrillar).
In a recent quantum chemical study, only four Tyr rotamers (a combination
of g+ and g−) were identified.36 The discrepancy probably comes from the fact that in quantum calculations,
only single molecules were taken into account and environmental effects
could not be fully included for the Tyr side-chain.

Figure 9 (X1;X2) angles of Tyr associated
with each peptide in the various systems studied. Rotamers 1, 2, 3,
4, 5, and 6 are shown as blue, red, gray, orange, yellow, and tan
shade centers, respectively.

As the amorphous aggregate becomes more tightly packed, the
Tyr side-chains will interact more closely with surrounding residues/backbones
of other peptides and will have less exposure to water. This affects
the Tyr side-chain movements, and they begin to more readily flex
into positions that are unfavorable in a monomer.

As is indicated
in Table 1, monomers
show some occupation of the first 4 rotamer states but with preference
to states 1 and 2 as described previously.28 The amorphous aggregates show approximately equal preference for
all states 1–4; however, this could be misleading; the peptides
begin as monomers before eventually stabilizing as an aggregate, which
means that the occupancy of states 1 and 2 could still be biased by
the initial stages of aggregation, although it is difficult to precisely
distinguish this effect in the simulation data.

a The error is below 0.001 because of the large number of frames
from the set of simulations presented above.

Conclusions
The series of simulations reported here
show that the rotamer state occupation of the Tyr side-chains is strongly
dependent on the Tyr side-chain’s immediate environment. Consequently,
amorphous aggregates have a different rotamer profile to monomers,
and the protofibril β-sheet structures reveal two new rotamer
states that appear to be uniquely associated with them. This observation
could pave the way to use intrinsic fluorescence of the Tyr residues
to monitor not only the initial, amorphous stages of Ab aggregation
(as done previously28), but also to detect
the onset of fibril formation without using the extrinsic fluorescence
sensors indicating appearance of β-sheets or fibrillisation
(e.g., ThioflavinT) that might interfere with the natural aggregation.
Indeed, the existence of six different Tyr rotamers in the heterogenic
Ab oligomers may be confirmed if each rotamer has its distinctive
fluorescence characteristics (e.g., fluorescence lifetime). In this
case, the contributions of the Tyr rotamers in the aggregating Ab
could be determined in fluorescence intensity decay measurements,
providing that the quantum yield of all rotamers is sufficiently high
to be identified in the fluorescence signal.

Our results also
suggest that excess solution ions may cause protein conformational
changes because of the electrostatic screening effect. This could
affect the stabilization or conformation of an aggregate and potentially
make more tightly (stable) aggregated systems which may allow for
rotamers 5 and 6 to appear more readily in protofibrils. The ionicity-induced
changes in the Tyr surroundings, together with the direct ion–Tyr
interactions, are likely to modify the experimentally observed fluorescence
responses.

The rotamers 5 and 6 (illustrated in Figure 1C) are a novel finding from
this work. These states do not appear to be artefacts as they are
present at various stages of the different protofibril trajectories.
However, we note that they do not occur in the second half of our
trajectories, and we believe that this might be due to the instability
of our small protofibril fragments arising from their short length,
a feature that would be mitigated in larger systems with longer protofibrils;
further work on this point is required. It is also clear from the
results that these states are directly caused by the stacking mechanism,
rather than the mirrored protein within a single layer of a fibril.
The detection of these new rotamers may still be possible despite
their low occupation (see Table 1). This is because although they only appear occasionally
in our quasi-stable structures, in larger fibrils they will appear
more often as there are more Tyr residues that will also be more tightly
packed together. Experimental work using fluorescence spectroscopy
could potentially be used to help identify these new rotamer states
through lifetime analysis in non-aggregated and aggregating systems.
Detection of these states could provide better understanding of the
aggregation and fibrillation kinetics and also provide a label-free
method to study the influence of additives on the aggregation, paving
the way to enhanced drug discovery studies.
