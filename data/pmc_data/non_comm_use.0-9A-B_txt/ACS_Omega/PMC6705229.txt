The present study investigated the
effects of iron, iron chelators, and mutations of tonB or iroN fepA genes on the growth and virulence
of Salmonella Typhimurium. Results
indicated that organic iron (ferric citrate and ferrous-l-ascorbate) supported better growth of Salmonella compared to inorganic iron. Among tested chelators, 2,2′-bipyridyl
at 500 μM showed the highest inhibition of Salmonella growth with 5 μM ferrous sulfate. Deletion of genes (tonB– and iroN– fepA–) in the iron uptake system attenuated Salmonella invasion of Caco-2 cells and its ability to damage
the epithelial monolayer. The expression of all tested host genes
in Caco-2 was not affected under the iron-poor condition. However,
claudin 3, tight junction protein 1, tumor necrosis factor α
(TNF-α), and interleukin-8 (IL-8) were altered under the iron-rich
condition depending on individual mutations. In Caenorhabditis
elegans, a significant down-regulation of ferritin
1 expression was observed when the nematode was infected by the wild-type
(WT) strain.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Nontyphi Salmonella (NTS) are invasive pathogens that cause nontyphoidal
salmonellosis, leading to significant public health issues and economic
losses.1 In Salmonella enterica and other pathogens, the acquisition of iron determines multiple
pathogenic characters and is required for their full virulence.2 The NTS possess a complicated iron uptake system
including the use of various siderophores to acquire enough iron from
the environment.3 Previous studies have
shown that the iron-siderophore system of S. enterica consists of the ferric-enterobactin (Fep) transporter system and
ferrichrome-iron (Fhu) transporter system.4,5 Importantly,
the siderophore receptors of the two iron transporter systems are
powered by TonB, an energy transduction protein that mediates the
active transport of ferric-siderophore complex across the outer membrane
of Gram-negative bacteria.6 Some outer
membrane proteins of Salmonella Typhimurium not only
function as catecholate siderophore receptors but also play a role
in bacterial pathogenesis. A previous study has shown that the virulence
of an iron uptake-defective mutant (iroN– fepA– cirA–) was attenuated
in a systemic infection in mice supplemented with l-norepinephrine.7 In addition, Tsolis et al.8 reported that the mutation of tonB attenuated
the infection of Salmonella Typhimurium in mice by
an intragastric route. The effects of several iron sources on Salmonella pathogenesis have been well studied. Ferric citrate
and ferric chloride were shown to increase the virulence of Salmonella in in vitro studies with Caco-2 cells.9,10 Similarly, Lin et al.11 reported that
supplementation of ferrous sulfate enhanced the virulence of Salmonella in mice. Ferric EDTA demonstrated a high iron
bioavailability in human studies and has been proposed to be used
as a fortificant in breakfast cereal and cereal bars.12 However, little is known about the effect of ferric EDTA
on the growth and pathogenesis of Salmonella. Also,
Kamdi and Palkar13 reported that ferrous-l-ascorbate had a high iron bioavailability in pregnant women
through an oral supplement. The effect of ferrous-l-ascorbate
on Salmonella pathogenesis is still largely unknown.

Massive and dynamic microbial communities including pathogens inhabit
in the animal gut. Epithelial cells are lined up and form mucosal
surfaces that provide a barrier between hostile external environments
and the internal milieu.14 Colonization
or invasion of gastrointestinal mucosal surfaces is the first step
for enteric pathogens to cause systematic infection.15 As an intracellular pathogen, Salmonella species possess the ability to infect a wide variety of cell types,
from kidney epithelial cells to macrophages.16 Caco-2, a human colon carcinoma cell line that expresses and organizes
brush border membrane components as enterocytes, could mimic the differentiation
of normal intestines under in vitro conditions.17,18 Well-differentiated Caco-2 cell monolayers could be adhered and
invaded by Salmonella Typhimurium, providing a valuable
in vitro model for pathogenic studies.16 The tight junction of the epithelial barrier is highly relevant
to the health of animal guts. A previous study showed that tight junction
proteins (TJP1 and CLDN3) were potential targets of many pathogens
including Salmonella.(19) The intestinal oligopeptide transporter, PepT1, is responsible for
transportation of dipeptides and tripeptides.20 It has also been reported to transport peptidomimetic drugs such
as β-lactam antibiotics cefadroxil and valacyclovir. Cytokines
play an indispensable role in the host–pathogen interaction.21Salmonella infection often
induces the expression of multiple chemokines and proinflammatory
cytokines including TNF-α and IL-8.21,22 In the present study, the expression of these genes was therefore
examined for the host response to Salmonella infection.

Caenorhabditis elegans has become
a popular model for studying animal development and behavior as well
as bacterium and host interactions since the 1960s.23,24 Labrousse et al.24 reported that Salmonella Typhimurium, a highly adapted strain with a broad
range of target hosts,25 was capable of
infecting and causing the death of C. elegans. In addition, it has been reported that acid-sensitive
mutants (UK1, fur-1, and ompR) of Salmonella Typhimurium presented
a reduced virulence not only in mammals but also in C. elegans.(24) The DAF/insulin-like growth factor (DAF/IGF), p38 mitogen-activated
protein kinase (p38 MAPK), and transforming growth factor-β
(TGF-β) signaling pathways that have remained essentially unchanged
throughout evolution are critical components in immune defense mechanisms
of C. elegans.(26,27) Genes nsy-1 and pmk-1 encode two
major components of the p38 MAPK signaling pathway, which is essential
for the innate immune system of C. elegans against pathogens.28 Gene daf-16 encodes a FOXO-family transcription factor that is a member in the
DAF/IGF signaling pathway.29 Murphy et
al.26 reported that daf-16 regulates a set of genes with functions in adulthood, aging, and
lifespan of C. elegans. Genes clec-85, lys-7, and spp-1 encodes a C-type lectin, lysozyme-like protein, and saposin-like
protein, respectively.30,31 These proteins possess antimicrobial
activities and are essential for the immunity of C.
elegans.(32,33) Zhou et al.33 recently described the
host response of the nematode to Escherichia coli infection and probiotic protection by activating the production
of antimicrobial peptides (including genes clec-85, lys-7, and spp-1) by regulating
its cell signaling, the p38 MAPK (e.g., Nsy-1 and Pmk-1) and DAF/IGF
pathways in particular, to combat the bacterial infection. C. elegans expresses two different kinds of ferritin
to regulate intracellular iron, which are ferritin 1 (encoded by ftn-1) and ferritin 2 (encoded by ftn-2).34 Simonsen et al.30 reported that ferritin 2 was involved in the immune response
against the infection by Gram-positive (Staphylococcus
aureus) and Gram-negative pathogens (E. coli). However, the functionality of ftn-1 on C. elegans against Salmonella infection remains unknown. Gene fgt-1 encodes a
major glucose transporter that plays an indispensable role in energy
supply to C. elegans.(35,36) It has also been reported to have a role in the longevity
and lifespan of C. elegans through
the DAF/IGF signaling pathway.35 Gene sod-3 encodes a mitochondrial superoxide dismutase (MnSOD)
that is involved in the breakdown of reactive oxygen species.37 Previous studies have shown that MnSOD is related
to the longevity of many animals including the lifespan of C. elegans.(37,38) In the present study, the expression of these genes in response
to Salmonella infection, both the wild type (WT)
and mutants, was examined to reveal the host response of C. elegans about iron requirement.

In the present
study, Salmonella Typhimurium from broiler chicken
was used to understand the role of specific iron uptake regulated
genes in its pathogenesis, aiming for improving the effectiveness
of Salmonella control in poultry production. Different
iron uptake-defective mutant strains of Salmonella as well as their complemented strains were generated and compared.
We examined four aspects:1 the effect of
different iron sources on Salmonella growth (both
the WT and mutants);2 the effect of iron
chelators including EDTA, citric acid, and 2,2′-bipyridyl on
inhibiting Salmonella growth;3 the invasion of Caco-2 cells by Salmonella grown
in the presence of different iron concentrations and the effect on
their transepithelial electrical resistance and their gene expression
profile;4 and the ability of the Salmonella strains to infect C. elegans and the response of the nematode to the infection.

2 Results
2.1 Effect of Different Iron Forms on Salmonella Growth
The effect of five different
forms of iron including ferric chloride, ferrous sulfate, ferric EDTA,
ferric citrate, and ferrous-L-ascorbate on the growth of Salmonella Typhimurium WT and its mutant strains were investigated. As shown
in Figure 1, regardless
of the forms of iron, the WT had much better growth than the two mutants
(tonB– and iroN– fepA–; P < 0.05)
after 4 h incubation and the growth of the WT in IMDM only (control)
showed the slowest growth among all the treatments (P < 0.05). The growth of the WT with ferrous-l-ascorbate
or ferric citrate was improved compared to ferric EDTA or ferric chloride
(P < 0.05). However, the WT treated with ferrous
sulfate showed comparable growth (P ≥ 0.05)
with ferrous-l-ascorbate or ferric citrate. Both mutants
hardly grew in IMDM only and had little growth when the medium was
supplemented with 0.2 μM iron regardless of the forms. No statistical
analysis was therefore applied.

Figure 1 Effects of different iron forms on the
growth of Salmonella Typhimurium. The optical density
(OD600) of bacterial suspension of the wild type and iron
uptake-defective mutants of Salmonella Typhimurium
was measured after the strains were cultured in IMDM containing 0.2
μM iron for 4 h. Values are means ± standard error of the
mean (SEM), n = 5. Control, no iron added; iroN– fepA–, mutant
defective in both iroN and fepA; tonB–, mutant defective in tonB; EDTA, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid. Symbol *** represents a
significant difference between the wild-type and mutants within the
control or each iron treatment (P < 0.05). A significant
difference in the growth performance was detected between bars with
the red edge and those with the green edge. Means marked with letters
“A”, “B”, and “C” were significantly
different (P < 0.05) for the wild type among different
iron treatments.

2.2 Deletion
of TonB, IroN, and FepA on Salmonella Growth
Figure 2 shows the
growth of the WT, mutant tonB–,
and mutant iroN– fepA– in IMDM containing ferric chloride from 0 to 10 μM.
The growth of the mutants was retarded compared to the WT. A concentration-dependent
growth was observed when ferric chloride was increased from 0.1 to
1 μM before 6 h. The growth curves of mutant tonB–, mutant iroN– fepA–, and the WT were comparable (P ≥ 0.05) when the supplementation of ferric chloride exceeded
5 μM. The growth of the WT, mutant, and complementary strains
on ferric chloride and ferric EDTA is shown in Figure 3. Both ferric chloride and ferric
EDTA supported similar growth of all tested strains. Under the iron-poor
condition, the WT appeared to grow approximately 100 and 30% better
than mutant tonB– and its complement
(P < 0.05), respectively, but not under the iron-rich
condition (Figure 3a,b). The growth of the WT, mutant iroN– fepA–, and its two partial complements
were similar after 12 h incubation under the iron-poor condition (Figure 3c,d). The supplementation
with 5 μM iron (iron-rich) generated full growth of the WT,
mutant iroN– fepA–, and one of its partial complement except for the partial complement
of iroN– fepA–::iroN+.

10 μM. Values are means ± SEM; n = 5.
Control, no iron added.

each measurement was 15 min for 12 h. Values are means ± SEM; n = 5. tonB–, mutant

2.3 Effect
of Iron Chelators on the Growth of Salmonella
The growth of the WT was monitored under the iron-rich condition
with either ferric chloride or ferrous sulfate in the presence of
increased concentrations of EDTA, citric acid, or 2,2′-bipyridyl.
EDTA at 1 mM showed significant inhibition of Salmonella growth (P < 0.05), reducing around 15% of growth
(Figure 4a). Similarly,
citric acid reduced Salmonella growth (P < 0.05, approximately 50%) at 1 mM (Figure 4b). In contrast, the growth of the pathogen
was significantly inhibited (more than 50%) by 2,2′-bipyridyl
at 250 μM (P < 0.05) and nearly abolished
at 500 μM (Figure 4c).

8 h. Values are means ± SEM; n = 5.

2.4 Deletion of TonB, IroN, and FepA on the Invasion
of Caco-2 Cells
Caco-2 monolayers were used for the assay
of Salmonella invasion into epithelial cells. As
shown in Figure 5a,
the percentages of invasion of mutant tonB– and mutant iroN– fepA– were significantly lower than that of the WT (P < 0.05) under both iron-rich and iron-poor conditions. The invasion
ability of complement tonB–::tonB+ was fully restored under both conditions.
However, while the invasion ability of complement iroN– fepA–::fepA+ was fully restored under both conditions, complement iroN– fepA–::iroN+ was not. Only a partial recovery of the
ability was observed when the complement was under iron-rich condition.
The invasion ability of all strains investigated was significantly
improved (P < 0.05) expect mutant tonB– (P ≥ 0.05) under
the iron-rich condition.

virulence of Salmonella Typhimurium. (a) Salmonella invasion into Caco-2 cells. Values are the percentage
of invasion (mean ± SEM) of the pathogen into a monolayer of
Caco-2 cells; n = 4. Percentage of the invasion was
presented as the colony-forming units (CFU) of Salmonella that had invaded into Caco-2 cells divided by CFU of initial inoculation
of Salmonella. Means marked with “a”
and “b” and those without a common letter were significantly
different (P < 0.05) for the iron-poor condition
among different strains; means marked with “A” and “B”
and those without a common letter were significantly different (P < 0.05) for the iron-supplemented condition among different
strains. Symbol *** represents a significant difference between the
iron-poor and iron-rich treatments within a strain (P < 0.05). (b) Ability of Salmonella to damage
the epithelial monolayer of Caco-2 cells. Values are the percentage
of relative tight junction permeability (mean ± SEM) that is
presented by the measured transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER)
values at 3 or 5 h of the assay divided by the initial TEER at the
beginning (0 h); n = 4. Means without a common letter
differ significantly (P < 0.05). tonB–, mutant defective in tonB; tonB–::tonB+, complement of tonB– mutant; iroN– fepA–, mutant defective in iroN and fepA; iroN– fepA–::iroN+, partial complement of mutant iroN– fepA– with iroN only; iroN– fepA–::fepA+, partial complement
of mutant iroN– fepA– with fepA only.

2.5 Deletion of TonB, IroN, and FepA on Tight Junction
Permeability of Caco-2 Cells
All the treatment groups of
the Caco-2 monolayer shared a similar relative tight junction permeability
after the first 2 h of incubation with different Salmonella strains, including the WT, mutants tonB– and iroN– fepA–, and their complements (data not shown). As shown in Figure 5b, the relative tight
junction permeability of the Caco-2 monolayer was significantly lower
(10% reduction, P < 0.05) only in the group treated
with the WT compared with the control (uninfected group) after 3 h
co-incubation. However, after 5 h co-incubation, significant damage
to the monolayer occurred (Figure 5b). The WT showed the most severe damage to the monolayer
among the different isolates. While both mutants caused less damage
to the monolayer than the WT, the only complement of tonB– (tonB–::tonB+) significantly restored the damage
to the level of WT (P < 0.05). At the end of co-incubation
(sixth hour), the Caco-2 monolayer in all the treatment groups except
for the one treated with mutant tonB– showed low relative TEER with no significant difference (P ≥ 0.05, data not shown).

2.6 Host
Response of Caco-2 to Salmonella WT and Its TonB,
IroN, and FepA Mutants
Tight junction proteins (CLDN3 and
TJP1), nutrient transporter (PepT1), and proinflammatory cytokines
(IL-8 and TNF-α) were used as indicators to investigate the
host response of Caco-2 cells to the Salmonella infection.
As shown in Figure 6, the gene expression in Caco-2 cells showed no significant changes
for all examined genes under the iron-poor condition between the infected
and uninfected Caco-2 except for IL-8 by the WT, as well as between
the WT and mutants (tonB– and iroN–fepA–). Under the iron-rich condition, the transcription of both CLDN3
(5- to 9-fold changes) and TJP1 (3- to 4-fold changes) was down-regulated
significantly when Caco-2 was invaded by the WT and mutant iroN–fepA– (P < 0.05). Compared to mutant tonB–, the WT and mutant iroN– fepA– significantly down-regulated the
expression of CLDN3 (5- to 9-folds, P < 0.05)
under the iron-rich condition (Figure 6a). A similar observation was also obtained with the
expression of TJP1 (Figure 6b). Notably, mutant tonB– did not significantly suppress (P ≥ 0.05)
the gene expression of tight junction proteins regardless of iron-rich
or iron-deficient conditions (Figure 6d). No significant difference (P ≥
0.05) in the gene expression of PepT1 was detected in Caco-2 cells
treated with the WT and with the two mutants, respectively (Figure 6c), although the
WT and mutant iroN– fepA– down-regulated the gene expression significantly compared
with uninfected Caco-2 (5- to 8-folds, P < 0.05).
The gene expression of TNF-α and IL-8 is shown in Figure 6d,e, respectively. All the
strains significantly up-regulated the expression level of TNF-α
in the infected Caco-2 cells under the iron-rich condition compared
with uninfected (more than 10-folds, P < 0.05).
In addition, the up-regulation was significantly higher in Caco-2
cells infected with the WT or mutant iroN– fepA– than with mutant tonB– (15- to 25-folds, P <
0.05) (Figure 6e). There was a significant up-regulation (more than 10-folds, P < 0.05) in the expression of IL-8 when Caco-2 cells
were infected with the WT or mutant iroN– fepA– under the iron-rich condition (Figure 6e). The increase
was larger by the WT than by the mutant (P < 0.05).
No significant difference was detected in the gene expression between
the treatments by the two mutants (P ≥ 0.05)
(Figure 6e).

Figure 6 Gene expression
of (a) claudin 3 (CLDN3), (b) tight junction protein 1 (TJP1), (c)
peptide transporter 1 (PepT1), (d) tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α),
and (e) interleukin 8 (IL-8) in Caco-2 cells as the response to Salmonella invasion. The Caco-2 cells were sampled on the
second hour of the invasion assay. Relative expression was determined
using the 2–ΔΔCt method.
The ΔCt was presented as the comparison
in the threshold cycle between the target genes and housekeeping genes
(18S and GAPDH), and ΔΔCt represented the comparison between the Salmonella-infected Caco-2 cells and uninfected Caco-2 cells. The reference
(=1) for the comparison was the gene expression in uninfected Caco-2
cells. The RNA sample of each treatment had three biological replicates
in the qPCR assay; n = 3. Bars with the red edge
indicate a significant difference in the gene expression between infected
and uninfected Caco-2 cells. Symbol *** represents a significant difference
in the gene expression within a strain between the iron-poor and iron-rich
treatments (P < 0.05). Means marked with “A”
and “B” and those without a common letter were significantly
different (P < 0.05) for the iron-rich treatment
among different strains. tonB–,
mutant defective in tonB; iroN– fepA–, mutant defective in both iroN and fepA.

2.7 Deletion of TonB, IroN, and FepA on the Lifespan
of C. elegans
The survival
curves of C. elegans after infection
by the WT, mutants tonB– and iroN– fepA–, and their
complements of Salmonella Typhimurium are shown in Figure 7. The death of worms
was first observed on day 4 of the assay, and viable worms dramatically
decreased in the following 4 days. The worms infected by the WT, mutant iroN–fepA–, and its partial complements (iroN–fepA–::iroN+ and iroN–fepA–::fepA+) had a significantly
reduced (P < 0.05) lifespan compared to the nematode
fed E. coli OP50 only (negative control).
In contrast, there was no significant difference (P ≥ 0.05) in the lifespan between the worms treated with mutant tonB– and with E. coli OP50 only (uninfected). Complement tonB–::tonB+ restored the ability to cause
a similar level of worm death by the WT (P ≥
0.05).

Figure 7 Effects of gene mutation in iron uptake on the ability of Salmonella Typhimurium to infect C. elegans. (a) Lifespan of C. elegans treated
with the wild type, mutant tonB–, or the complement of tonB–;
(b) lifespan of C. elegans treated
with the wild type, mutant iroN– fepA–, or partial complements of mutant iroN– fepA–. Each treatment
group had about 50 worms that were incubated in the S medium containing
24 μM iron in the lifespan assay. Worms fed with E. coli OP50 (109 CFU/mL) only served
as a reference. The final concentration of Salmonella in the assay mixture was 109 CFU/mL. tonB–, mutant defective in tonB; tonB–::tonB+, complement of mutant tonB–; iroN– fepA–, mutant defective in both iroN and fepA; iroN– fepA–::iroN+, partial complement of mutant iroN– fepA– with iroN only; iroN– fepA–::fepA+, partial complement
of mutant iroN– fepA– with fepA only. Survival curves without a common
letter (“a” and “b”) differ significantly
(P < 0.05). The E. coli OP50 and Salmonella cultures used for the C. elegans lifespan assay were all in the early stationary
phase.

2.8 Host
Response of C. elegans to Salmonella WT and Its TonB, IroN and FepA Mutants
The gene expression
of the defense molecule (sod-3), antimicrobial peptides
(spp-1, clec-85, and lys-7), nutrient transporter (fgt-1), iron storage (ftn-1), and components in the IGF (daf-16) or p38 MAPK signaling pathway (nsy-1 and pmk-1) was investigated with the worms sampled on day 5
in the lifespan assay where iron was not limited. The treatment groups
of nematodes were infected with the WT and mutants (tonB– and iroN–fepA–, respectively). As shown
in Figure 8, no significant
difference (P ≥ 0.05) was detected in the
expression of all tested genes except for ftn-1 that
was down-regulated (5-folds, P < 0.05) in the
worms infected with WT compared to the uninfected worms. In contrast,
more than 2-fold increase in the gene expression of clec-85, daf-16, and sod-3 (P < 0.05) was achieved by mutant tonB– (P < 0.05). Mutant iroN–fepA– also
demonstrated a similar up-regulation (P < 0.05),
including genes spp-1, nsy-1, pmk-1, daf-16, and sod-3. Compared with the WT, the two mutants enhanced the expression (4-
to 7-folds, P < 0.05) of five genes in total (clec-85, nsy-1, pmk-1, daf-16, and sod-3), in which mutant tonB– altered clec-85, daf-16, and sod-3 and mutant iroN–fepA– up-regulated nsy-1, pmk-1, and daf-16. The ftn-1 was the only gene in
the worms treated with the WT that was significantly down-regulated
compared to the mutant-treated and uninfected worms (P < 0.05).

Figure 8 Host response of C. elegans at the gene expression level to the infection of Salmonella Typhimurium wild type and mutants. Several genes related to antimicrobial
peptide production, MAPK and IGF signaling pathways, and other molecules
related to nutrient metabolism and defense in C. elegans were selected as the targets for the qPCR assay. The nematode was
sampled on day 5 of the lifespan assay. Relative expression was determined
using the 2–ΔΔCt method.
The ΔCt was the comparison in the
threshold cycle between target genes and housekeeping genes (snb and act-1). The ΔΔCt represented the comparison between Salmonella-infected C. elegans and C. elegans treated with E. coli OP50 only. The reference (=1) for the comparison
was the gene expression in uninfected C. elegans. The RNA samples of each treatment had three biological replicates
in the qPCR assay; n = 3. Means marked with “a”
and “b” and those without a common letter were significantly
different (P < 0.05) for the same gene among different
strains. Bars with the red edge indicate a significant difference
in the gene expression between infected and uninfected Caco-2 cells. tonB–, mutant defective in tonB; iroN– fepA–, mutant defective in both iroN and fepA; sod-3, superoxide dismutase 3; fgt-1, facilitated glucose transporter protein 1; ftn-1, ferritin; spp-1, saposin-like protein; clec-85, c-type lectin; lys-7, lysozyme-like

3 Discussion
Salmonella Typhimurium used in the present study was isolated from broiler
chicken.39 The information generated from
this study may be useful for developing a strategy to control the
pathogen for poultry production.

One objective of the present
study was to investigate the effect of different forms of iron on
the growth of Salmonella Typhimurium. Organic iron
(ferrous-l-ascorbate and ferric citrate) appeared to be favored
by the pathogen for growth compared with inorganic iron (ferric EDTA
and ferric chloride), in which Salmonella growth
on organic iron showed a higher growth rate in the log phase than
on inorganic iron (data not shown). A similar preference to organic
iron for iron absorption has been reported previously in animals.40 Some studies proposed that animals had a high
level of absorption of organic iron because organic acid and amino
acid ligands of the organic iron can protect the ferrous iron from
oxidation and/or interaction with other metal ions.40,41 There was also a study confirming that intestinal epithelial cells
favored ferrous iron than ferric iron because DMT-1 was the major
pathway for uptake of ferrous iron in both organic and inorganic forms.42 Even though Salmonella had
an iron-porin-Feo (Feo) system that is similar to the DMT-1 pathway
of a mammalian animal, a complicated iron-siderophore system is also
used by Salmonella to acquire iron to grow and survive
in iron-poor environments.43,44 Moreover, enteric bacteria
including Salmonella possess both a citrate-dependent
iron (III) transport and ferric dicitrate transport systems for uptaking
ferric citrate as well as a wide variety of metal-free and metal-loaded
tricarboxylic acids.45,46 An exclusive citrate-dependent
iron transport system for uptaking ferric citrate might explain why
ferric citrate showed a better enhancement on Salmonella growth compared with the inorganic iron investigated (FeSQ4 and FeCl3).47

In the
present study, the function of IroN and FepA on the growth of Salmonella was evaluated. Results confirmed previous reports
stating that TonB, FepA, and IroN proteins are important for Salmonella growth.48,49 Mutation of tonB impaired the functionality of all tonB-dependent (iron-siderophores) receptors on the outer membrane, as
shown by growth curves. Similarly, mutation of iroN and fepA impaired the integrity and functionality
of the Fep system, which retarded the growth of mutant iroN– fepA–. Interestingly, the
growth curves of all mutant strains were similar to the WT under the
iron-rich condition (> 5 μM), which suggested that Salmonella might have a Fe3+ iron uptake system
that did not relate to the TonB protein nor to the investigated iron-siderophore
system.

Among the three chelators tested in the present study,
2,2′-bipyridyl was the most effective in inhibiting Salmonella growth. Previous studies have reported that 2,2′-bipyridyl
could increase the antimicrobial property of polymer-Cu(II) complexes
by enhancing the lipophilic character of the central metal atom.50,51 However, most of the antimicrobial activities of 2,2′-bipyridyl
were reported when it was combined with other metal ions (e.g., platinum,
cobalt, and copper) or with metal complexes.52,53 It is possible that 2,2′-bipyridyl chelated Fe3+ and/or other metal ions supplemented in media, which retarded the
growth of Salmonella. Unfortunately, a toxicity test
on rat showed that LD50 of 2,2′-bipyridyl was 256
and 155 mg/kg through oral administration and vein injection, respectively.54 More studies are therefore required to determine
its potential in application.

Our results clearly confirmed
that iron increased the ability of Salmonella Typhimurium
to invade a differentiated Caco-2 monolayer, in agreement with previous
studies.55,56 Moreover, iron uptake system (Fep)-defective
mutants of Salmonella Typhimurium significantly reduced
their ability to invade the intestinal epithelial cells, suggesting
that iron uptake systems are required for the virulence of Salmonella in animal guts. This is also confirmed by the
evidence that defective iron uptake systems prevented an increase
in permeability through tight junction stabilization (e.g., CLDN3)
and blocking of proinflammatory response (e.g., reduced TNF-α
and IL-8 gene expression). It is possible that, upon the down-regulation
of the elevated expression of TNF-α and IL-8 by defective iron
uptake systems (Fep), the expression of CLDN3 was stabilized; as a
result, damage to the integrity of the enterocyte barrier was slowed
down. A similar correlation was reported previously in the porcine
jejunal epithelial IPEC-J2 cell line.57 In addition, IL-8 has been shown to be essential for Salmonella to pass through epithelial Caco-2 monolayers,58,22 and TNF-α contributes to the tissue pathology associated with Salmonella infection.59 Interestingly,
the down-regulation of the PepT1 expression by Salmonella Typhimurium under iron-rich condition was prevented by the mutant tonB–, suggesting that Salmonella infection could reduce nutrient absorption (e.g., small peptides).
TNF-α and IL-8 play important roles in the host defense mechanisms.
Eckmann and Kagnoff21 reported that TNF-α
and IL-8 are induced when the hosts are infected by Salmonella. One interesting finding is that the expression levels of TNF-α
and IL-8 were altered in the Caco-2 cells infected by mutant iroN– fepA–. There might
be some interaction between the iron receptor (iroN– fepA–) of Salmonella and the host immune systems. We also demonstrated that iron was
necessary for observing the changes in the gene expression of tight
junction protein and proinflammatory cytokines among the WT and iron
uptake system-defective mutants of Salmonella Typhimurium.
Taken together, our results suggest that iron and iron uptake systems
are essential for the virulence of Salmonella in
animal guts.

In the present study, the importance of TonB, IroN,
and FepA in the virulence of Salmonella was evaluated
in C. elegans with a lifespan assay
followed by an investigation into the host gene expression and regulation
of cell signaling and defense molecule production. The result of the
lifespan assay (except for mutant iroN– fepA–) was consistent with the observation from
the Caco-2 invasion experiment in the present study (Figure 5) as well as from mouse infection
studies reported previously.8,60 It is interesting to
note that the WT strain of Salmonella Typhimurium
caused no changes in the expression of all tested genes related to
cell signaling and defense molecule production (including antimicrobial
peptides) in the nematode compared with uninfected worms (Figure 8). In contrast, either
mutant tonB– or mutant iroN– fepA– was able
to up-regulate some of the genes, for example, clec-85, sod-3, and daf-16 by mutant tonB– and spp-1, sod-3, nsy-1, pmk-1, and daf-16 by mutant iroN– fepA–, suggesting the involvement of both genes
in Salmonella infection to C. elegans. Given the facts that only mutant tonB– (but not mutant iroN– fepA–) lost the ability to infect C. elegans and its complement restored the capacity
in addition to the up-regulation of clec-85 and sod-3 expression by the mutant in particular, it appears
that both clec-85 and sod-3 may
play a substantial role in the defense of the nematode against Salmonella infection. It has been documented from previous
studies that the p38 MAPK and DAF/IGF pathways control the expression
of the antimicrobial peptides.61,62 Very recently, there
was a report that a Lactobacillus isolate could regulate C. elegans signaling through the p38 MAPK and DAF/IGF
pathways to control the production of antimicrobial peptides and defense
molecules to combat E. coli infection.33 One significant finding from
the C. elegans experiment in the present
study was the down-regulation of ftn-1 by the WT
of Salmonella Typhimurium only (Figure 8). The gene regulates the expression
of ferritin 1 that has a role in iron storage of the host, and knocking
out of ftn-1 would reduce the lifespan of C. elegans grown in the environment with excess iron.63 It may suggest that Salmonella could affect the expression of ftn-1 and create
an intracellular environment with sufficient iron. Our observation
on the inability of mutants tonB– and iroN– fepA– to alter the gene expression of ftn-1 supports
the notion, providing further evidence for the importance of ftn-1 in the pathogen and host interaction during Salmonella infection.

This study clearly demonstrated
that EDTA, 2,2′-bipyridyl, and citric acid can effectively
inhibit the growth of WT and iron uptake-defective mutants of Salmonella. 2,2′-Bipyridyl is not approved as a feed
ingredient. Citric acid and EDTA can be used in animal feeds, but
these chelators not only reduce iron availability to Salmonella but also decrease the bioavailability of minerals including iron
to animal hosts. This makes it very difficult to include chelators
into feeds to control Salmonella. However, these
chelators could be included in poultry litters to reduce the survival
of Salmonella in poultry farms.

4 Materials
and Methods
4.1 Materials
Proteinase K was purchased
from Qiagen (Germantown, Maryland, United States). Tryptic soy agar
was purchased from BD Difco (Franklin Lakes, New Jersey, United States).
All other chemical agents were purchased from Fisher Scientific (Ottawa,
ON, Canada) and Sigma-Aldrich (Oakville, ON, Canada). Chemicals used
in the present study were of analytical reagent grade.

4.2 Iron Content Analysis Using Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical
Emission Spectrometry
Iscove’s modified Dulbecco’s
medium (IMDM; Sigma-Aldrich) is a chemically defined iron-poor medium
that is suitable for both tissue cultures and bacterial cultures.
The iron concentration in the completed IMDM was determined using
inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES).
Briefly, the IMDM powder was dissolved in NERL high purity water (Fisher
Scientific) and prepared according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
The medium samples containing 2% (v/v) nitric acid were analyzed by
the Manitoba Chemical Analysis Laboratory for iron content using ICP-OES.
The results of ICP-OES analysis indicated that the iron concentration
in the completed medium was approximately 0.8 μM. Although the
form of iron in the IMDM medium is unknown, the contained iron level
is negligible. Therefore, the IMDM medium supplemented with no iron
is defined as an iron-poor medium, while that supplemented with iron
at 5 μM or above is called an iron-rich medium in the present
study.

4.3 Bacterial Strains and Growth Conditions
S. enterica serovar Typhimurium
ABBSB1218-1 was isolated from broiler chicken as previously reported.43 The strains used in this study including both
the WT and mutants as well as some complemented strains are shown
in Table 1.39,64 IMDM was used as the culture medium in the in vitro experiments
to investigate the effect of iron and iron chelators on bacterial
growth and virulence. Lysogeny broth (LB, Fisher Scientific) was used
for bacterial culture in the C. elegans experiments. The WT and mutant strains were cultured aerobically
with shaking at 37 °C. Complemented strains were cultured and
maintained under the same conditions as the WT strains except for
the supplementation of 50 μg/mL kanamycin (Sigma-Aldrich) in
the culture medium.

4.4 Evaluation of Bacterial Growth on Different
Forms of Iron
To determine the effect of different forms
and different concentrations of iron on the growth of Salmonella Typhimurium, Bioscreen C MBR (Oy Growth Curves Ab Ltd., Helsinki,
Vuorimiehenkatu, Finland) was used in this study to measure the optical
density (OD) of bacterial suspension.

Salmonella Typhimurium was subcultured three times in IMDM to eliminate iron
contamination from previous cultures. Bacteria were inoculated at
104 CFU/mL into IMDM media containing 0 to 50 μM
of either ferric citrate, ferric chloride, ferric EDTA, ferrous-l-ascorbate, or ferrous sulfate. The inoculated IMDM (350 μL/well)
from each treatment was transferred to Bioscreen honeycomb plates
(Oy Growth Curves Ab Ltd.) with five wells of technical replicates.
The optical density of the suspension in each well was measured every
15 min at 600 nm (OD600) for 16 h. Growth curves were analyzed
with Bioscreen C MBR software.

4.5 Evaluation
of Iron Chelators for Inhibiting Bacterial Growth
The growth
of the WT of Salmonella Typhimurium was measured
using Bioscreen C MBR (Oy Growth Curves Ab Ltd.) and the protocol
described above. Ferric chloride or ferrous sulfate was used as the
iron source in this study. Salmonella growth in IMDM
only served as a negative control, while the positive control was
the growth in IMDM supplemented with 5 μM ferric chloride or
ferrous sulfate. Increasing concentrations of iron chelators, including
EDTA (5 to 1000 μM), citric acid (1000 to 10,000 μM),
and 2,2′-bipyridyl (50 to 500 μM), were supplemented
to IMDM containing 5 μM iron to examine the effect of the iron
chelators on the growth of Salmonella Typhimurium.

4.6 Cell Line and Growth Conditions
The colon
adenocarcinoma cell line Caco-2 (ATCC HTB-37) was obtained from American
Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, Virginia, United States).
Six-well plates, 12-well plates, and 12-well Millicell membrane cell
inserts were purchased from Corning Costar (Fisher Scientific).

Caco-2 cells were cultured at 37 °C under 5% CO2 in
Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium (DMEM) with 4.5 g/L glucose,
0.586 g/L l-glutamine, 1000 U/mL penicillin–streptomycin
(Fisher Scientific), and 3.7 g/L sodium bicarbonate.65 The culture medium was changed every other day, and the
antibiotics-free medium was applied at the last medium change before
the experiments were performed. In the assay of Salmonella Typhimurium invasion into epithelial cells, Caco-2 cells were cultured
in 12-well plates (Corning Costar, Fisher Scientific) with DMEM and
10% (v/v) FBS for 4 to 6 days to reach 100% cell confluency (5 ×
104 cell/cm2). DMEM with 20% (v/v) FBS was used
to cultivate the cells for the tight junction permeability assay.

4.7 Caco-2 Invasion Assay
The ability of Salmonella Typhimurium to invade epithelial cells was determined
using Caco-2 cells at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 100:1.65 Caco-2 cells (1 × 105) were
seeded in each well of 12-well plates. The DMEM medium was removed,
and Caco-2 monolayers were washed twice with 0.5 mL/well of phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS) prior to the invasion assay. Bacterial strains were inoculated
into fresh IMDM containing 5 μM ferric chloride at a final concentration
of 4 × 107 CFU/mL. The bacterial suspension was transferred
to the wells (0.5 mL/well) containing Caco-2 monolayers and co-incubated
in IMDM at 37 °C for 2 h. The bacterial cells were then killed
by incubation with gentamicin (150 μg/mL, 0.5 mL) in PBS for
1 h.66,67 Epithelial monolayers were then washed twice
with PBS and lysed with 200 μL of 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich);
the Salmonella count that had invaded Caco-2 cells
was determined by 10-fold serial dilution and plating on tryptic soy
agar (BD Difco). The percentage of bacterial invasion was presented
by the following formula  

4.8 Assay for Caco-2 Tight
Junction Permeability
The effect of the WT, mutants, and
complements of Salmonella Typhimurium on the tight
junction permeability of epithelial cells was studied using Caco-2
cells. The Caco-2 cells were cultured in 12 mm Millicell cell culture
inserts (12 wells, Corning Costar, Fisher Scientific) in DMEM for
12 to 16 days until the transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER)
value of the monolayers in all wells became stable between 1200 and
1400 Ω cm2 prior to the assay for measuring TEER
in IMDM after two washes of Caco-2 monolayers with PBS.68,69 The TEER was expressed after subtracting from the resistance reading
of the supporting membrane and multiplying it by the surface area
of the Caco-2 monolayer. The TEER value was measured every other day
by a Millicell ERS-2 voltohmmeter (Millipore Co., Bedford, Massachusetts,
United States). The MOI was 100:1, and the Salmonella Typhimurium suspension was prepared as the invasion assay stated
above. The bacterial suspension was added to the wells (500 μL/well)
containing Caco-2 monolayers and coculture for 6 h in IMDM at 37 °C
under 5% CO2. The TEER value of the monolayers was measured
and recorded immediately 1 h after inoculation. The permeability value
was calculated following the formula  

4.9 C elegans Lifespan
Assay
C. elegans temperature-sensitive
defect mutants (glp-4; SS104) and E. coli OP50 were obtained from the Caenorhabditis
Genetics Center (Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States). C. elegans was maintained on a nematode growth medium
(NGM) with E. coli OP50 lawn using
standard protocols.70

The C. elegans lifespan assay with the treatment of various Salmonella Typhimurium strains was performed as described
previously.71 Adult worms were collected
by sterilized water from NGM plates to perform synchronization, as
described by Stiernagle.70 Approximately
300 synchronized eggs were transferred on NGM agar with E. coli OP50 lawn and incubated at 25 °C for
72 h to grow to the L4 stage. After the L4 worms were collected in
S basal solution and washed twice with S medium via centrifugation
(1300g for 1 min) and resuspension, 20 to 25 worms
were assigned to each well of a six-well titer plate (Costar) with
2 mL of S medium and then incubated at 25 °C for 8 days. The
S medium was not changed during the assay. Each treatment had a total
number of 45 to 50 worms. Worms fed with E. coli OP50 (109 CFU/mL) only served as the control, while worms
treated with various Salmonella Typhimurium strains
(109 CFU/mL) were regarded as the treatment groups. The E. coli OP50 culture and Salmonella Typhimurium cultures used for the lifespan assay were all in the
early stationary phase. The bacteria were washed twice in S medium
by centrifugation and resuspension before being fed to the nematode.
To determine the survival of C. elegans, a worm was considered dead when it did not respond to touch. The
number of dead worms was recorded daily, and the percentage of the
worms’ survival was presented following the formula  

4.10 Total
RNA Extraction and cDNA Synthesis
The method for extracting
RNA from Caco-2 was adapted from Cuadras et al.72 Briefly, Caco-2 cells infected with bacteria were stabilized
at 4 °C overnight with RNAlater solution (Ambion,
Fisher Scientific). The total RNA of Caco-2 cells was isolated using
the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. The RNA quality and yield were determined using NanoDrop
1000 (Fisher Scientific) and 1.5% agarose gel electrophoresis. Total
RNA was purified using TURBO DNA-Free kit (Ambion) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. The complementary DNA (cDNA) synthesis
was performed using qScript cDNA SuperMix (QuantaBio, Beverly, Massachusetts,
USA). One microgram of purifying RNA from each sample was used for
cDNA synthesis in 20 μL of a reaction mixture.

The method
for total RNA isolation from C. elegans was adapted from Ketting et al.73 Briefly,
a total of 40 worms from each treatment condition were collected on
the fifth day of the lifespan assay. The sampling on day 5 was chosen
based on our observation that the worm’s survival decreased
dramatically on days 6 and 7 postinfection with Salmonella. In each well, the worms were washed twice with RNase-free water
to remove bacterial cells. The washed worms were transferred into
a new RNase-free Eppendorf tube, mixed with 25 μL of lysis buffer,
and then incubated at 65 °C for 10 min followed by 85 °C
for 1 min. The lysis buffer consisted of 0.5% (v/v) Triton, 0.5% (v/v)
Tween-20, 0.25 μM EDTA, 2.5 μM Tris–HCl buffer
(pH 8.0), and 1 mg/mL proteinase K. The total RNA of C. elegans was isolated from the lysate using TRIzol
RNA isolation reagents (Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. The RNA yield and RNA integrity were measured and determined,
respectively, by the same method described above for Caco-2 RNA isolation.
The isolated total RNA was purified, and cDNA was synthesized as previously
described.33

4.11 Quantitative
PCR Analysis
The mRNA abundance of various genes related
to tight junction proteins, inflammation factors, and nutrient transporters
of Caco-2 cells was analyzed using quantitative polymerase chain reaction
(qPCR) assays. The qPCR was performed with 50 ng of cDNA constructed
above using the fluorescent dye SYBR Green methodology and an ABI
Prism 7500 Fast Real-Time PCR system (Applied Biosystems, Fisher Scientific).
The qPCR conditions were as follows: a total of 40 PCR cycles, denaturing
at 95 °C for 30 s, annealing at 60 °C for 1 min, extension
at 72 °C for 30 s. The specificity of each gene amplification
was verified at the end of each qPCR reaction by analysis of melting
curves of the PCR products. The curves of amplification were read
with ABI Prism 7500 software using the comparative cycle threshold.
Relative quantification of the target mRNA levels was presented after
normalization of the total amount of cDNA tested to endogenous references
18S RNA and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase
(GAPDH). The primers for qPCR are listed in Table 2.74−79 The results of qPCR were analyzed using the 2–ΔΔCt method to determine the fold changes of target
genes.33 The ΔCt was presented as the difference in threshold cycle between
the target genes and housekeeping genes (18S and
GAPDH), and ΔΔCt was the difference
in ΔCt between the Salmonella-infected Caco-2 cells and uninfected Caco-2 cells. The gene expression
in the uninfected Caco-2 cells was used as the baseline (reference
= 1).

The mRNA abundance of several genes encoding for antimicrobial
peptides and a defense molecule, components in the p38 MAPK and DAF/IGF
signaling pathway, and nutrient utilization-related functions of C. elegans was analyzed by qPCR assays. A total of
10 ng of C. elegans cDNA was used for
a qPCR assay using the same conditions stated above. Relative quantification
of the target mRNA levels was presented after normalization of endogenous
references (snb-1 and act-1). The
primers for qPCR are listed in Table 3.33,35,63 The 2–ΔΔCt method
was used to determine the fold changes of target genes.37 The ΔCt was
presented as the difference in the threshold cycle between the target
genes and housekeeping genes (act-1 and snb), and ΔΔCt was the difference
in ΔCt between the Salmonella-infected C. elegans and uninfected C. elegans. The gene expression in C. elegans treated with E. coli OP50 only (uninfected worms) was used as the baseline (reference
= 1).

4.12 Statistical
Analysis
All statistical analyses were performed using the
GraphPad Prism 6 software (San Diego, United States) except that the
survival curve analyses of C. elegans were performed using the Statistical Analysis System (SAS release
9.4, SAS Institute Inc., Cary, North Carolina, United States). Comparison
of C. elegans survival curves was performed
by Kaplan–Meier estimator with a log-rank test. In the bacterial
invasion, tight junction permeability, and gene expression studies,
Tukey’s multiple comparison tests were used to determine differences
among treatment means. P < 0.05 was taken to indicate
statistical significance.
