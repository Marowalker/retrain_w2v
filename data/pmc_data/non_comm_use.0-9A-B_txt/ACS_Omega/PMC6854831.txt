The
aggregates of microtubule-associated protein Tau are considered
as a major hallmark of Alzheimer’s disease. Tau aggregates
accumulate intracellularly leading to neuronal toxicity. Numerous
approaches have been targeted against Tau protein aggregation, which
include application of synthetic and natural compounds. Toluidine
blue is a basic dye of phenothiazine family, which on irradiation
with a 630 nm light gets converted into a photoexcited form, leading
to generation of singlet oxygen species. Methylene blue is the parent
compound of toluidine blue, which has been reported to be potent against
tauopathy. In the present work, we studied the potency of toluidine
blue and photoexcited toluidine blue against Tau aggregation. Biochemical
and biophysical analyses using sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide
gel electrophoresis, ThS fluorescence, circular dichroism spectroscopy,
and electron microscopy suggested that toluidine blue inhibited the
aggregation of Tau in vitro. The photoexcited toluidine blue potentially
dissolved the matured Tau fibrils, which indicated the disaggregation
property of toluidine blue. The cell biology studies including the
cytotoxicity assay and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production assay
suggested toluidine blue to be a biocompatible dye as it reduced ROS
levels and cell death. The photoexcited toluidine blue modulates the
cytoskeleton network in cells, which was supported by immunofluorescence
studies of neuronal cells. The studies in a UAS Tau E14 transgenic Drosophila model suggested that photoexcited toluidine blue
was potent to restore the survival and memory deficits of Drosophila. The overall finding of our studies suggested
toluidine blue to be a potent molecule in rescuing the Tau-mediated
pathology by inhibiting its aggregation, reducing the cell death,
and modulating the tubulin levels and behavioral characteristics of Drosophila. Thus, toluidine blue can be addressed as a potent
molecule against Alzheimer’s disease.

Introduction
Alzheimer’s
disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative
disorder characterized by decline in the cognitive function, inefficacy
to perform regular work, social withdrawal, and poor judgment. AD
is associated with short-term memory loss, which predominantly affects
CA1, CA3, and dentate gyrus regions of hippocampus. Extracellular
senile plaques composed of amyloid-β (Aβ) and intracellular
neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) are the hallmarks of AD.1−4 In physiological conditions, Tau is found to be associated with
microtubules and functions to stabilize the microtubules. In pathological
conditions, Tau undergoes various post-translational modifications,
oxidative stress, and truncation, resulting in its aggregation.5−9 The molecules that are potent in inhibiting the aggregation of Tau
fibrils are now being considered as a therapeutic for AD.5,10 Small molecules of natural and synthetic origin were being studied
extensively for their medicinal potency against AD pathology.3,6,7,11 Dyes
have been reported for their medicinal potency in AD, and different
classes of dyes including porphyrins, phenothiazine, xanthine, etc.
showed therapeutic potency in AD. Certain dyes have the property of
photoexcitation and are applied in the treatment of several dermatological,
microbial, and cancerous disorders. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) or
the application of photoexcited (PE) dyes is widely used for the treatment
of carcinomas, biofilms, dental plaques, dermatological problems,
etc. Photoexcited toluidine blue (TB) is widely used as bactericide,
but its effect on neuronal degeneration is yet to be addressed. Principally,
the therapy is based on targeting the disaggregation potency of photoexcited
dyes against pathological protein aggregates. PDT was found to be
effective in inhibiting amyloid-β aggregation and increasing
its disaggregation by employing xanthene and porphyrin dyes. TB has
been reported for its inhibitory properties against proteins like
prion, amyloid-β, Tau, etc.12−14 Methylene blue (MB)
and its derivatives were found to be more potent against AD.15 Moreover, MB inhibits oligomer formation in
amyloid-β, which is more toxic and accelerates the less toxic fibril
formation. HT-22 cells were used to study the role of oxidized and
reduced forms of MB in neurodegenerative disorders.16 Additionally, photoexcited MB was also found to inhibit
the aggregation of Aβ. Drosophila has a similar organization of brain
to that of humans, where Tau plays a critical role in maintaining
the integrity of the cytoskeleton of neurons. The mutation of Tau
protein in Drosophila brain leads to formation of
NFTs, which mimic the tauopathy condition of human brain.17 The earlier works have demonstrated the potency
of photoexcited xanthene dyes and porphyrin dyes against Aβ
aggregation. The potency of photoexcited dyes with respect to Tau
aggregation has not been reported. The aim of the present work was
to study the potency of TB and PE-TB against Tau aggregation and its
biocompatibility. The hypothesis was evaluated using the biochemical
and biophysical assays such as the ThS fluorescence assay, sodium
dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), transmission
electron microscopy (TEM), and circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy.
The biocompatibility of TB and PE-TB was tested in Neuro2a cells and
the transgenic Drosophila model. The aim of the present
study was to evaluate the potency of TB and PE-TB in tauopathy. The
in vitro and in vivo studies suggested the potency of TB against Alzheimer’s-related
pathology.

Results
Toluidine Blue Inhibits Tau Aggregation in
Vitro
Tau
protein domain organization comprises a projection domain and a microtubule-binding
domain. The schematic hypothesis depicts the domain organization of
full-length Tau and its interaction with TB (Figure 1A). The four-repeat region of Tau, R1 to
R4, is the aggregation-prone region. The potency of TB for inhibiting
in vitro Tau aggregation was studied. For the assay, the heparin-treated Tau was incubated
with various concentrations of TB ranging from 0 to 40 μM. The
aggregation was measured by observing ThS fluorescence at different
time intervals, and the fluorescence kinetics suggested that TB showed
potent Tau aggregation inhibition. The 40 μM concentration of
TB was found to show appreciable inhibition of Tau assembly (Figure 1B). Moreover, the
morphological changes in TB-treated Tau were studied by electron microscopy.
The electron micrographs suggested long extended filamentous Tau aggregates
in the control sample, whereas incubation with TB resulted in small
broken pieces of Tau, which indicated the inefficacy of Tau to aggregate
(Figure 1C,D). The
conformation of Tau plays an important role in pathophysiology of
AD. In physiological conditions, Tau has a typical random coil conformation,
but during aggregation, Tau attains a β-sheet conformation that
absorbs at 220 nm. In our work, the effect of TB treatment on the
secondary structure of Tau was studied. The untreated Tau aggregates
showed CD spectrum of a β-sheet structure, whereas the TB-treated
protein was found to be random coil (Figure 1E). TB has an absorption maximum at 630 nm
(Figure S1A,B). Furthermore, the binding
constant of TB for Tau was measured by UV spectroscopy. The binding
constant (KD) for TB and Tau was calculated
by measuring the long-range spectrum of TB on incubating with various
concentrations of full-length Tau. As Tau and TB both have basic charge,
TB showed low affinity for Tau. A high KD value of 14 μM suggested a weak interaction between the dye
and protein (Figure 1F).

Figure 1 Tau inhibition by toluidine blue. (A) Schematic hypothesis of Tau
aggregation inhibition by TB. The bar diagram demonstrates the domain
organization of 441 amino acid long full-length Tau. Structurally,
Tau can be divided into two domains, viz., the projection domain and
the microtubule-binding domain. The four-repeat regions contribute
majorly in aggregation of Tau, and the proline-rich region is a target
for many post-translation modifications. (B) Effect of TB on inhibiting
Tau aggregation was monitored by the ThS fluorescence assay. (C, D)
Electron micrograph of Tau aggregates revealed long fibrillar morphology
of Tau aggregates, whereas in the presence of TB, small broken fibrils
were observed. Tau aggregates after incubating with TB exhibited the
population of small, broken filaments after PDT treatment. This indicated
the potency of TB in disintegrating Tau aggregates. (E) Native Tau
has a random coil conformation, but as it aggregates, it attains a
β-sheet conformation. Treatment with TB inhibited the conformational
change in Tau, in concentration-dependent manner. (F) The absorbance
maximum curve of TB in the presence of Tau at a fixed wavelength of
630 nm was measured, and the hyperbolic curve with a KD value of 14 μM was observed.

Photoexcited Toluidine Blue Disaggregates Tau Filaments
The potency of PE-TB in dissolving the preformed Tau aggregates was
studied by incubating mature Tau fibrils with varying concentrations
of PE-TB. In present experiments, TB was irradiated with red light
(630 ± 10 nm), which led to photoexcitation of TB. The effect
of PE-TB on Tau disaggregation was characterized by different biochemical
and biophysical methods. SDS-PAGE showed the characteristic signature
of higher-order aggregates in control samples (Figure 2A), while the treated samples showed no higher-order
aggregates on SDS-PAGE. These results firmly indicated the effective
role of photoexcited TB in destabilizing preformed Tau aggregates
in vitro. Moreover, TEM studies indicated the disaggregation potency
of PE-TB for Tau, as Tau aggregates were disassembled into short and
fragile aggregates (Figure 2B,C). The ThS fluorescence assay suggested that PE-TB potentially
reduces the Tau fibrils as a decrease in fluorescence intensity was
observed in a concentration-dependent manner (Figure 2 D). Here, we speculate that the disaggregation
potency of PE-TB could be a cumulative effect of TB and the singlet
oxygen species produced after photoexcitation.

Figure 2 PE-TB disaggregates the
mature Tau fibrils. (A) SDS-PAGE analysis
of Tau aggregates treated with varying concentrations of PE-TB ranging
from 2 to 40 μM demonstrates a clear decrease in higher-order
aggregates. These results indicate the effective role of PDT against
higher-order aggregates. The red box indicates the disappearance of
higher-order aggregates on SDS-PAGE, which was apparent in the control
group. (B, C) Electron microscopy shows long, thick, matured fibrils
of Tau, whereas after incubating with PE-TB, Tau exhibits the population
of small, broken filaments. This indicated the potency of TB in disintegrating
Tau aggregates. (D) ThS fluorescence analysis of PE-TB-treated Tau
aggregates. In PDT-treated samples, the fluorescence intensity decreased
drastically. Here, 40 μM TB showed the maximum effect in disaggregating
the mature aggregates.

Biocompatibility and Toxicity
of TB
TB is a photosensitizer;
thus, the efficiency of TB to produce singlet oxygen species in cells
was estimated by the fluorometric 2′,7′-dichlorofluoresceindiacetate
(DCFDA) assay. In our work, neuronal cells were treated with various
concentrations of PE-TB and TB (Figures 3A and S2A) ranging
from 0.025 to 2.5 μM. The results indicated the neuroprotective
property of TB, as it generated low reactive oxygen species (ROS)
levels. The effect of TB and PE-TB was studied for cellular toxicity.
The methylthiazolyldiphenyl-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay suggested
that in the presence of TB the viability of cells was rescued in the
Tau-stressed group (Figures 3B and S2B). TB-treated cells were
exposed to 10 min of irradiation so as to observe the cytotoxicity
of PE-TB. The results suggested that PE-TB was not toxic to cells
up to 500 nM, but the high concentration of PE-TB was found to be
toxic. The results suggested that viability of Tau-assaulted Neuro2a
cells was rescued in the presence of PE-TB. Morphologically, no distinguished
change was observed after the TB treatment, but the PE-TB treatment
at lower concentration (500 nM) led to the formation of neuronal outgrowths
in Neuro2a cells, which was indicative of cytoskeleton modulation
(Figure 3C).

Figure 3 Biocompatibility
of PE-TB. (A) The DCFDA assay indicated the extent
of ROS production by PE-TB in Neuro2a cells treated with 2.5 μM
Tau aggregates. These data suggest that in the presence of TB low
levels of ROS were produced. (B) MTT analysis showed that the presence
of TB rescued cell viability after exposing to Tau aggregates. PE-TB
exhibited a protective role on cell viability in Tau-stressed cells.
(C) Cell morphology did not alter after exposure to TB and PE-TB,
which indicated healthy cells.

Toluidine Blue Modulates the Cytoskeleton
Microtubules
are the key component of the cytoskeleton network. The effect of TB
on the cell cytoskeleton was studied by immunofluorescence assays.
The effect of TB and PE-TB on cytoskeleton modulation was studied
by targeting tubulin levels in cells. The cells treated with lower
concentration of TB (0.5 μM) found to have healthy morphology
with long neurite outgrowth and high tubulin expression as compared
to untreated cells. On the contrary, a higher concentration of 5 μM
of TB and PE-TB generates toxicity to the cells, leading to change
in cell morphology. Additionally, the cells were also tagged with
the pan-Tau K9JA antibody to observe the levels of Tau expression.
The treatment showed increased Tau expression, which supports the
fact that PE-TB modulates the cytoskeleton network. The fluorescence
images of single neuronal cells clearly indicated that distribution
of tubulin and Tau was increased after the PDT treatment. The distribution
of Tau and tubulin in neurons was clearly observed in the florescent
microscopic images of single neuronal cells (Figure 4).

Figure 4 Modulation of the cytoskeleton network by PE-TB.
The cells were
treated with various concentrations of TB. At lower concentration,
TB (0.5 μM) showed high expression of tubulin with increased
neurite outgrowth, whereas high TB concentration (5 μM) was
found to be toxic to cells. PE-TB also showed extended neurite outgrowth
at lower concentration, whereas 5 μM PE-TB was cytotoxic. The
fluorescent image of a tubulin-stained single neuronal cell suggested
that distribution of tubulin was prominently in neurite outgrowths
and Tau was distributed in the cell soma.

Effect of TB and PE-TB on Transgenic Drosophila Model
The overexpression of Tau in the nervous system of Drosophila mimics tauopathy, i.e., the neuronal accumulation
of Tau aggregates leading to abnormal behavior. The effect of TB and
PE-TB on various behavioral aspects of UAS-E14 Tau mutant Drosophila was studied. Drosophila behavioral
studies were carried out in two sets: the first set was with TB and
the other was with PE-TB. The parameters chosen for the studies were
feeding behavior, locomotory dysfunction, and loss of memory and potency
to reproduce. The current data suggest that PE-TB has a rescuing effect
on transgenic flies (Figure 5A). The flies treated with PE-TB showed increased food uptake
when compared to the group exposed to TB. There was no concentration-dependent
change in either set of TB exposure (Figure 5B). The next set of experiments were carried
out to analyze the effect of TB and PE-TB on olfactory sensation of Drosophila larvae, that is, basically, the ability to avoid
bad odor. The objective behind the experiment was to check the memory
deficit in UAS Tau E14 transgenic Drosophila larvae
after treatment with dye. The transgenic UAS Tau E14 larvae were unable
to avoid the odor efficiently as compared to wild-type flies. The
TB treatment restored olfactory sensation, indicating the potency
of TB to affect the nervous system of E14 Tau Drosophila. Here, the photoexcited dye showed more potency over non-photoexcited
TB. In the case of concentration-dependent treatment, a bell-shaped
pattern was observed, which indicates that 5 μM PE-TB has maximum
activity in restoring olfactory sensation of flies (Figure 5C). Succeeding experiments
were performed to examine the effect of TB and PE-TB on the locomotor
system in Tau flies. The negative geotaxis assay was performed, and
the numbers of flies escaped were plotted against the time to interpret
results in terms of percentage. The results showed a similar bell-shaped
pattern as in the earlier experiment. The 5 μM concentration
of PE-TB was estimated to be potent for rehabilitating the locomotor
activity of flies (Figure 5D). Furthermore, the effect of TB and PE-TB was observed on
the longevity of flies. For this objective, two assays, viz., the
viability assay and fecundity assay, were carried out. It was observed
that PE-TB increases the longevity of flies more efficiently than
TB. After the treatment of dye, survival and egg laying ability of
flies increased and a bell-shaped pattern was observed, indicating
the efficiency of 5 μM dye to increase survival of tauopathy Drosophila mutant UAS Tau E14 flies (Figures 5E and S3). The
overall experimental data concluded that TB was effective in restoring
the adverse effect of tauopathy in Tau E14 flies. Additionally, PE-TB
was more effective than non-photo-excited TB. Of all concentrations, 5 μM
concentration of TB and PE-TB was found to be optimal and most effective
in treating Drosophila tauopathy.

Figure 5 Effect of TB and PE-TB
on behavior of transgenic Drosophila. (A) Transgenic
flies were exposed to TB and PE-TB for various time
points at different stages of life cycle to study their effect in
restoring memory deficit, locomotory dysfunction, and viability. (B)
Results suggest the effect of various concentrations of TB and PE-TB
on feeding behavior of flies. PE-TB was found to be more potent than
non-photo-excited TB. (C) E14 Tau flies were exposed to various concentrations
of TB to analyze changes in olfactory sensation by avoiding the bad
odor of quinine. The 5 μM concentration of PE-TB demonstrated
appreciable potency in restoring the olfaction. (D) Negative geotaxis
assay was performed to examine the effect of TB on locomotion of flies.
The bell-shaped graph indicated 5 μM PE-TB to be effective in
rescuing the locomotory system of E14 Tau Drosophila. (E) Data indicates 5 μM TB to have appreciable effect on
the survival rate of transgenic flies. The significance was calculated
using Student’s t-test in SigmaPlot 10.0, where *p < 0.05, **p < 0.001, and ***p < 0.0001, the statistical difference between control
and treated groups before photoexcitation, and #p < 0.05, ##p < 0.001,
and ###p < 0.0001, the statistical
difference between control and treated groups after photoexcitation.

Discussion
Pathological Tau leads
to generation of paired helical filaments
(PHFs), which are characteristic features of AD.8 The importance of small molecules has been reported, which
include synthetic and naturally originated compounds.18,19 Dyes were tested thoroughly for their medicinal property because
of being inexpensive, highly specific, and more potent. Their photoexcitation
property was explored against various protein aggregates including
Aβ, Tau, Prion, etc.12,20,21 Toluidine blue is a phenothiazine dye, which was known to decrease
the AD pathology. TB was reported to decrease the secretion of pathological
Aβ-40 and Aβ-42.22 Furthermore,
TB was found to modulate the amyloid-protein-mediated pathology in
hippocampus; on the contrary, TB was unable to rescue the Tau phosphorylation
in transgenic 3 × Tg mice.22 Moreover,
in the present study, we investigated the effects of TB and PE-TB
against Tau aggregation. MB, the parent compound of TB, has been reported
in the literature as a potent Tau aggregation inhibitor. In our experiments,
the KD value of 14 μM indicated
weak binding affinity of TB for Tau, which could be due to the basic
charge of TB. However, in this contemporary study, the potency of
PE-TB in dissolving the preformed Tau aggregates has also been analyzed
by various biochemical and biophysical methods such as ThS fluorescence,
SDS-PAGE, CD spectroscopy, and electron microscopy. Additionally,
TB possesses the tendency of photoexcitation like its parent compound
MB and exposure at 630 nm leads to generation of singlet oxygen species.23 The ThS binding revealed the role of TB in inhibiting
the aggregation of Tau. The aggregates formed were analyzed qualitatively
using TEM, which details the effect of small molecules on the aggregate
morphology. The phenothiazine dye MB effectively inhibited Tau aggregate
formation.24 However, other dyes such as
methyl yellow, azo dye, and ponceau, a sulfonated dye, had no effect
on Tau aggregation.25 The morphology of
Tau in the presence of TB evidenced the potential in preventing aggregate
formation, resulting in fragmented filaments. The protein loses its
native conformation during aggregation, and this was shown by change
in absorbance in the far-UV region. Studies showed that photoexcited
MB prevented the conformational changes in Aβ from a random
coil to a β-sheet-rich structure.26 Similarly, TB also prevented conformational changes in Tau and maintained
its random coil conformation. Generation of singlet oxygen species
is a characteristic of a photosensitizer, and being a potent photosensitizer,
TB generates singlet oxygen.27,28 TB is a reported photosensitizer;
thus, the levels of ROS produced by PE-TB have been studied. The minimal
generation of ROS by PE-TB projects it as a biocompatible photosensitizer,
which can be further implied in vivo to check its efficiency. Protein
aggregates are known to induce oxidative stress in cells.29−31 Thus, we studied the effect of TB in the context of ROS production,
and the result suggested that in Tau-stressed cells low levels of
ROS generated in the presence of TB. A dye is considered as biocompatible
if it generates low levels of toxicity in cells.32 Our findings suggested that TB has moderate cytotoxic potency
at lower concentrations. Additionally, it protects cells from oxidative
stress and other toxic insults.33 Similar
results were observed in the present experiments, which evidenced
TB to be nontoxic in Neuro2a cells up to a sub-micro-molar level.
There are studies suggesting the fact that treatment with natural
compounds such as curcumin and resveratrol increases the neurite outgrowths
and helps in proliferation of cells.34 Similarly,
the high throughput screening of cerivastatin identified it as a neurite growth accelerator.35 Likewise in our experiments, TB and PE-TB were
found to increase the neurite outgrowth in Neuro2a cells. Drosophila has been proven to be an ideal model for neurodegenerative
diseases. Several mutants of drosophila have been reported in the
context to tauopathy.36 Recently, the studies
stated that photoexcited MB decreased the vacuole formation in Drosophila brain, indicating the rescue from neurodegeneration.37 Human Tau pathology has been effectively modeled
in Drosophila, which was based on overexpression
of mutant Tau in fly brain. PE-TB rescued the tauopathy in Drosophila. We found that PE-TB reversed tauopathy-induced
neurodegenerative phenotypic disorders like olfactory disability,
reproductive potentiality, loss of memory, and locomotory disability
in UAS Tau E14 Drosophila mutants. The behavioral
deficits were targeted for studying the effect of Tau expression in Drosophila neurons. These results indicate that PE-TB could
suppress behavioral defects by reducing the formation of Tau aggregates
in Drosophila brain. Collectively, behavioral analysis
in Drosophila indicates that tauopathy-induced behavioral
defects were rescued after TB treatment. Neurons are essential for
olfactory learning, which is elicited by memory retrieval or stability.
This underlies the cognitive deficits observed early in many tauopathies.
The overall studies on TB in various in vitro and in vivo systems
strongly support its efficiency against AD-related tauopathy.

Conclusions
The Tau aggregates are considered to be one of the leading causes
of AD. Thus, for studying a new therapeutic molecule for AD, Tau aggregates
are being targeted. We investigated the potency of TB against Tau
aggregation, and the results of all of the studies suggested that
TB possesses a dual property of aggregation inhibition and disaggregation.
In this study, we addressed, for the first time, the role of PE-TB
against mature Tau aggregates. The in vitro assays supported that
PE-TB has potency to dissolve the pathological Tau fibrils. Additionally,
the low levels of singlet oxygen species generation by PE-TB make
the dye more appropriate for administration in a biological system.
The in vivo studies on the Drosophila model of tauopathy
also supported TB as well as PE-TB to be a biocompatible molecule.
The overall results of our study provide evidence to support the efficiency
of TB as well as PE-TB as a novel molecule against tauopathy.

acid (BCA), CuSO4, thioflavin S (ThS), ANS, toluidine blue,
MTT, and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) were purchased from Sigma. IPTG

were purchased from Ted Pella, Inc. Advanced DMEM/F-12 media, fetal
bovine serum (FBS), pensterp cocktail, and anti-anti were purchased
from Gibco. All laboratory reagents used for Drosophila studies were purchased from Merck.

Recombinant Preparation
of Tau
The recombinant full-length
Tau was purified as per the published protocol.11 Briefly, the recombinant full-length Tau was expressed
in the Escherichia coli BL21* strain.
The cells were grown at 37 °C till the OD600 reached
0.5 to 0.6. They were then induced with 0.5 mM IPTG and were further
incubated for 4 h and harvested by centrifugation at 4000 rpm for
10 min. The protein isolation and purification were done as described
previously.38 The lysing of cells was done
using homogenizer constant cell disruption systems. The cells were
resuspended in buffer A composed of 50 mM MES, 1 mM EGTA, 2 mM MgCl2, 5 mM DTT, 1 mM PMSF, and 50 mM NaCl and were subjected to
homogenization at 15 000 psi pressure. The obtained lysate
was heated at 90 °C for 20 min in the presence of 0.5 M NaCl
and 5 mM DTT. This was cooled and centrifuged at 40 000 rpm
for 45 min. The supernatant was collected and dialyzed overnight against
buffer A before loading to a cation exchange column. Increasing the
ionic gradient of NaCl to 1 M, the Tau protein was eluted. The protein
quality was analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and the protein was further passed
through size exclusion chromatography columns. The obtained protein was analyzed, pooled, and concentrated.
The concentration was estimated by the BCA assay, and the protein
was stored at −80 °C till further use. Tau aggregation
was induced at 37 °C with heparin as previously described.39 Tau in the presence of an anionic inducer such
as heparin, RNA, arachidonic acid, etc. undergoes aggregation. Among
all of these molecules, the heparin-induced Tau aggregation is a widely
accepted model for in vitro tauopathy studies. Earlier studies suggested
the heparin-mediated Tau aggregation model to demonstrate the transition
of Tau from random coil to β-sheets upon aggregation.40 Taniguchi et al. demonstrate the inhibition
of heparin-induced Tau filaments by phenothiazine, polyphenols, and
porphyrins.25 In the present work, Tau aggregation was induced
by heparin where the soluble full-length Tau was mixed with heparin
(17 500 Da) at a ratio of 4:1. The reaction was carried out
in 20 mM BES buffer supplemented with 25 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT, and 0.01%
NaN3 and protease inhibitor cocktail mixtures.

Thioflavin
S Fluorescence Assay
The effect of TB on
the aggregation property of Tau was measured by the thioflavin S (ThS)
fluorescence assay.10 ThS is a mixture
of methylated dehydrothiotoluidine and sulfonic acid and has the property
to fluoresce on binding to β-sheet structures. The fluorescence
measurement was carried out by incubating 2 μM Tau with ThS
in a 1:4 ratio for 15 min in the dark. All of the reaction mixtures
were measured in triplicate, in a TECAN Infinite M200 PRO spectrophotometer,
at an excitation of 440 nm and emission of 521 nm. Further, the data
was analyzed using SigmaPlot 10.0.

Circular Dichroism Spectroscopy
The conformational
changes in Tau were analyzed using CD spectroscopy in the far-UV region.
In native conditions, Tau has a typical random coil conformation,
but the aggregation causes a conformational change to β-sheet,
which absorbs at around 220 nm. The effect of TB on conformational
changes in Tau was studied as described previously.41 All of the spectra were measured in a Jasco J-815 spectrometer
by diluting full-length Tau to 3 μM in 50 mM phosphate buffer
at pH 6.8.

Binding Constant
The binding constant
of TB with Tau
was estimated by UV–visible spectroscopy. The experiment was
performed using a 96-well clear bottom plate (Eppendorf), and measurements
were recorded in a Tecan Infinite M200 PRO spectrophotometer. TB (20
μM) was incubated with varying concentrations of Tau (0, 10,
20, 30, 40, and 50 μM). The binding constant (KD) value was calculated after recording the spectrum ranging
from 230 to 800 nm. The absorption maximum of Tau was observed at
314 nm. All of the samples were diluted in phosphate buffer, at pH
6.8.  Here, [P0] is the initial protein
concentration, [L] is the free ligand concentration, [PL] is the concentration
of the protein–ligand complex, and KD is the dissociation constant.

Light-Induced Inhibition
of Tau Assembly
For analyzing
the effect of photoexcited TB on Tau aggregates, aggregates were incubated
for 1 h in the dark with varying concentrations of TB (2, 5, 10, 20,
and 40 μM). Then, 200 μL of the reaction mixture was added
in a 96-well black plate (Eppendorf) and was irradiated in the dark
using red LED. After 1 h of incubation, the samples were analyzed
by ThS fluorescence and SDS-PAGE for the presence of disintegrated
Tau.

Light-Induced Inhibition of Tau Aggregates Analyzed by SDS-PAGE
The inhibitory effect of TB on Tau aggregation was observed by
SDS-PAGE. Various TB-treated reaction mixtures were analyzed. Aggregates
have a characteristic pattern of higher molecular weights around 250
kDa; thus, the effect of TB on aggregation propensity of Tau can be
easily observed by SDS-PAGE. The experiments were performed using
a GE miniVE electrophoresis unit and a BIORAD Mini-PROTEAN electrophoresis
unit.

Transmission Electron Microscopy
The morphological
analysis of Tau fibrils was done by electron microscopy, and the samples
were prepared according to the published protocol.11 For electron microscopic analysis, 2 μM Tau was incubated
on carbon-coated copper grids. Following this, the samples were negatively
stained with 2% uranyl acetate. The images were captured by TECNAI
T20 at 120 kV.

ROS Production in Neuro2a Cells
The effect of photoexcited
TB on ROS production was estimated in Neuro2a cells using the 2′,7′-dichlorofluoresceindiacetate
(DCFDA) assay.42,43 ROS oxidizes 2,7-dichlorofluorescindiacetate
to 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein (DCF), leading to the generation
of fluorescence. For the assay, 10 000 cells/well were seeded
in a 96-well plate and incubated for 24 h. The cells were treated
with various concentrations of TB following 10 min of irradiation
in the dark. After treatment, the cells were washed twice with 1×
PBS (pH 7.4), supplemented with 10 μM DCFDA, and incubated for
20 min. After incubation, the cells were again washed twice with 1×
PBS. Finally, 100 μL of phenol red-free Dulbecco’s modified
Eagle medium (DMEM) was added in each well and fluorescence was measured
at 535 nm upon exciting at 485 nm.

Cytotoxicity Assay
The cell viability was analyzed
by the methylthiazolyldiphenyl-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay.10,44,45 Neuro2a cells were cultured in
advanced DMEM/F-12 media supplemented with 10% FBS and glutamine.
The cells were trypsinized with a 0.25% trypsin-EDTA solution. A total
of 10 000 cells/well were seeded in 96-well plates for the
assays. After 24 h, the cells were treated with various concentrations
of TB for 24 h, followed by addition of MTT at a concentration of
0.5 mg/mL and incubation at 37 °C for 4 h. The formazan crystals
formed were dissolved in 100 μL of 100% DMSO. Cell viability
was evaluated by measuring the absorbance at 570 nm. Similarly, cells
were incubated with 2.5 μM aggregates to observe the cytotoxicity
of Tau aggregates; additionally, TB was also added to cells along
with aggregates for analyzing the effect of TB in the presence of
aggregates. TB-treated cells were subjected to 10 min of irradiation
for the cytotoxicity analysis of PE-TB.

Immunofluorescence Analysis
of Tubulin Expression in Neuro2a
Cells
Neuro2a cells were seeded at a density of 50 000
cells on glass cover slips. The cells were treated with various concentrations
of TB (0.5, 5, and 50 μM) and incubated overnight at 37 °C.
Similarly, another set of cells treated with various concentrations
of TB were irradiated with red light for 10 min and incubated at 37
°C. The cells were fixed with absolute methanol for 20 min at
−20 °C. After fixation, cells were permeabilized by 0.2%
Triton X-100. After 3 subsequent washes of PBS, the cells were incubated
with 5% horse serum for 1 h. The cells were incubated with the anti-tubulin
(Thermo PA1-41331) and K9JA (Dako A0024) antibody. After overnight
incubation, the cells were incubated with Alexa Fluor 488 (A11034)-
and Alexa Fluor 555 (A32727)-tagged secondary antibodies. The nucleus
was stained with DAPI. The cells were scanned by a Zeiss Axio observer
7.0, apotome 2.0 inverted microscope using 63× magnifications
in oil immersion and at 40% light intensity.

Fly Stocks and Genetics
The transgenic Drosophila strain used in this
study was UAS Tau E14. The ELAV-Gal4 driver
line was obtained from the National Drosophila Stock Center at the
University of Mysore, Mysore, Karnataka, India. Drosophila strains were raised on standard medium. Fly cultures and crosses
were carried out at 25 °C.

Fly Husbandry
Flies were maintained on standard banana-jaggery
medium (SM) under standard laboratory conditions of 24 ± 1 °C
temperature, 75 ± 5% relative humidity, and 12:12 light and dark
cycle (SLC).46 Flies were maintained in
a 2 week discrete generation cycle for 10 generations before being
used in this study. The adult density was regulated at about 100 flies
per half-pint bottle with 25 mL of SM in 10 bottles. Flies from 10
bottles were combined into a single breeding cage, hereafter referred
to as parental cage.

Preparation of TB-Supplemented Diet
A total of 2.5
L of SM was prepared and split into five batches of 500 mL each as
described previously.46 For the control
group, SM was poured into the bottles. For the TB-supplemented media,
2.5, 5.0, 10, and 25 μM TB was added and mixed thoroughly just
before pouring into the bottles. All bottles were plugged with nonadsorbent
cotton, and the media were allowed to set under room temperature.

Larval Feeding Behavior Assay
The eggs obtained were
transferred at a density of 50 eggs/6 mL of SM and allowed to develop
till early third instar. The early third instar larvae were removed
from the SM vials and used in the feeding behavior assay. Larvae were
individually transferred to an assay Petri plate of 5 cm diameter
containing 10 mL of either liquid SM (SM without agar) or liquid SM
supplemented with different concentrations of TB and allowed to acclimate
for 5 s. The feeding rate was measured as the mean number of sclerite
retractions in two consecutive 30 s intervals. The average of the
two rates was taken as the feeding rate of that larva. Then, 20 larvae
were assayed for each of the two treatment groups. The feeding rate
assays were replicated four times. A total of 160 larvae were assayed
for the feeding rate.

Fecundity Assay
Flies from the holding
vials were sexed
under low CO2 anesthesia, and a single pair (one male +
one female) was transferred to a vial with ∼3 mL of SM. Then,
20 such vials were set up per treatment, per population. Flies were
transferred without anesthesia to fresh SM vials every 24 h, and the
eggs laid during the previous 24 h were counted under a microscope
and recorded. The daily egg counts were carried out till the death
of female fly in each test vial.

Negative Geotaxis Assay
The ability to move against
gravity and climb indicated the level of physical fitness of test
animals. Vertical climbing ability of male flies that emerged from
different treatment bottles was assessed. Twenty male flies per treatment
group were collected and transferred to the empty, 0–15 cm
graduated vial. The vial was gently tapped and placed in a vertical
position. The number of flies that crossed the 15 cm mark in 30 s
was counted. Three trials were conducted on each set of 20 flies.
The data was expressed as percentage of flies that crossed the 15
cm mark.

Viability of Fly from Egg to Adult
The eggs from medium
plates were collected and dispensed into different treatment groups
of bottles at a density of ∼100 eggs/bottle with 45 mL of media.
Ten bottles each for five treatment groups of SM and SM with 2, 5,
10, and 25 μM TB were prepared. Bottles were maintained at standard
laboratory conditions. The flies emerged from different treatments,
SM and SM with 2, 5, 10, and 25 μM TB, were designated, collected,
and counted. All of the assays were carried out on SM using mated
flies. The total number of flies that emerged from each bottle were
used to calculate the viability of flies emerging from each treatment
group.

Larval Olfactory Behavior
The olfactory test was carried
out by employing the previous method with minor modifications.47 A total of 30 larvae were briefly dried on a
filter paper before being placed in the center of the Petri dish.
The Petri dish containing 20 μL of quinine sulfbad odate dispensed
on each of the two 0.5 cm radius filter disks were placed in a diametrically
opposite position to quinine zones. After 2 min of placing the larvae
and covering the Petri dish, numbers of larvae in different zones
were counted to calculate the percentage of larvae avoiding the bad
odor after training.

Statistical Analysis
Using either
duplicate or triplicate
reading, the statistical data were plotted. Untransformed (raw) data
were analyzed and plotted by SigmaPlot 10.0 software. The data were
analyzed for significance by Student’s t-test,
where *p < 0.05, **p < 0.001,
and ***p < 0.0001.
