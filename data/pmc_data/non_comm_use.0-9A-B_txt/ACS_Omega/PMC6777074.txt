Atrazine is a common herbicide that
is widely used to control weed
growth in both agricultural and residential settings. It has been
shown to act as an endocrine disruptor that affects aquatic organisms.
Rapid and low-cost monitoring methods for atrazine is the first step
to mitigate its widespread persistency. Aptamers are small synthetic
oligonucleotides that can assume a 3D structure to act as the molecular
recognition element for a specific target of interest. Two different
atrazine binding aptamers (R12.23 Trunc. and R12.45 Trunc.) have been
identified from the same library design but with fundamentally different
in vitro selection methodologies. While the R12.23 Trunc. has been
utilized in immobilized biosensing platforms, it is unclear if in-solution-based
applications would be suitable for both atrazine binding aptamers.
This study provides the first insight of comparative in-solution binding
profiles of the two atrazine binding aptamers. Based on our results,
this information will be useful for future biosensing platform development
utilizing the two aptamers.

==== Body
Introduction
Atrazine is one of
the most widely applied herbicides in the world.1 It is used to control the growth of many kinds
of grass and broadleaf weeds in crops such as corn and sorghum. In
addition, it has also been used on residential lawns.2 Atrazine can leak into the soil and contaminate both the
ground and drinking water.3 The presence
of atrazine in these bodies of water has increased public concern
about atrazine contamination. It can also damage plants which are
not resistant to atrazine because of the absence of a detoxifying
system.4 Studies have shown the negative
impacts of atrazine on amphibians, fish, and algae and its potential
toxicity in the aquatic ecosystem.5 Atrazine
is also known to be an endocrine disruptor that reduces the production
of testosterone in mammals. A study demonstrated that daily exposure
to atrazine could diminish the testosterone level in male rats.6 Kucka et al. identified that atrazine disrupts
the endocrine system by inhibiting cAMP-specific phosphodiesterase-4
and leads to an increase in the cAMP level. This causes an increase
in the production of prolactin in rat pituitary cells and androgen
from Leydig cells.7 Because of the widespread
use and the detrimental effects of atrazine, it is important to be
able to monitor its level precisely. Currently available methods to
detect atrazine such as [liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (MS)]
or gas chromatography/MS require specific expensive equipment and
are typically labor-intensive.8 Thus, the
development of a rapid biosensing system can be beneficial to the
monitoring of atrazine contamination of soil and water. Aptamers have
been shown to have a high potential to be incorporated into different
biosensing systems.9−11

Aptamers are short single-stranded RNA or DNA
oligonucleotide molecules
capable of binding to specific targets with a high affinity and specificity.
They are low cost in production and relatively stable and can be chemically
synthesized with high purity. Many ssDNA aptamers have been reported
to undergo conformational changes upon target binding. This particular
binding property is favorable in biosensing systems.12 Nucleic acid aptamers can be selected from large random
oligonucleotide pools through a method, termed systematic evolution
of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX).13,14 In brief, the large random oligonucleotide library is subjected
to repeated cycles of incubation with target molecules, partitioning
of nonbinding library molecules, and amplification of target bound
library molecules. The target selection rounds (positive rounds) are
sometimes followed by counter target selections (negative rounds),
which enhances the selectivity of the resulting aptamer candidates.12 Different variants of SELEX such as graphene
oxide SELEX (GO-SELEX) and Capture-SELEX have been described to identify
aptamers with conformational changes upon binding to targets.15,16

There were previously three ssDNA aptamers reported that are
specific
toward atrazine.8,17,18 Williams et al. identified a single-stranded DNA aptamer with a
high affinity for atrazine using a stringent SELEX methodology.8 The authors utilized fluorescently labeled full-length
aptamer (a 79-mer) to characterize its binding affinity and specificity
toward atrazine. The reported (Kd) for
this ssDNA aptamer (R12. 23) is 0.62 ± 0.21 nM. It also displayed
a high specificity toward atrazine. In addition, a truncated version
of R12.23 (R12.23 Trunc.) was coupled with capillary electrophoresis
to show a proof-of-principle detection assay.8 In another study, Sanchez utilized a capillary electrophoresis SELEX
(CE-SELEX) technique to select an ssDNA aptamer (At-Apt-25) specific
to atrazine. The fluorescent polarization technique was used to characterize
the aptamer’s binding affinity. The reported Kd was 890 nM.18 Even though
two previously described aptamers showed good affinity and specificity
toward atrazine, both aptamers were characterized with a fluorescent
label, which may interfere with the binding interaction between the
ssDNA aptamer and the small molecule. McKeague et al. previously reported
utilizing an array of characterization methods to determine the binding
affinity between small-molecule targets and aptamers in solution,
and with immobilized aptamers. The study reported that the measured
binding affinity of small-molecule binding ssDNA aptamers can vary
to a large degree depending on the characterization methods.19 This suggests that thorough binding characterization
experiments are needed before aptamer-based biosensor development.

Our group recently reported an ssDNA aptamer (R12.45 Trunc.) that
binds to atrazine with high affinity and specificity using three different
in-solution binding experimental characterization methods.17 The result was perplexing, in which R12.45 Trunc.
displayed nonconventional binding characteristics. In brief, R12.45
Trunc. displayed target induced structural stabilization that prevents
aptamer-coated gold nanoparticle from target binding salt-induced
aggregation. R12.45 Trunc. also displayed enhanced an SYBR Green fluorescence
signal in the presence of low concentrations of atrazine. This result
was different from traditional SYBR Green displacement fluorescence
assays. It is to be noted that the oligonucleotide library used to
identify the R12.45 Trunc. had the same primer design as the one used
in the Williams study.8 To utilize R12.45
Trunc. as the binding element in a biosensor, we further compared
the in-solution binding properties between R12.45 Trunc. and R12.23
Trunc. In this study, we used isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC),
circular dichroism (CD) analysis, SYBR Green displacement fluorescence
assay, and two different setups of gold nanoparticle colorimetric
assays to characterize the in-solution binding differences between
R12.45 Trunc. and R12.23 Trunc. At the conclusion of this study, all
but one assay demonstrated significant differences in binding properties
between the two studied aptamers. This study generated additional
knowledge that will be useful in the future development of ssDNA aptamer-based
atrazine biosensors utilizing the R12.45 Trunc. aptamer.

Results and Discussion
ITC Binding
Experiments
One of the major challenges
in developing aptamer-based biosensing assays is to obtain the binding
affinity profile of each aptamer precisely. While aptamer binding
between whole-cell and protein targets can be readily characterized
with standardized analytical methods such as fluorescence-activated
cell sorter and surface plasmon resonance (SPR), characterization
of binding affinity between the aptamer and small molecules remains
a challenge. McKeague et al. previously investigated how different
binding assays yield a wider variance of the equilibrium dissociation
constant (Kd) between individual pairs
of aptamer and small molecule targets.19 To study this phenomenon further, we employed different in-solution
binding assays to integrate two different atrazine-specific ssDNA
aptamers, which were identified from the same library design, termed
RMWN34, originally developed by the Sooter group formerly at West
Virginia University.8

Previously,
Williams et al. utilized a semi in-solution method to characterize
the binding affinity (Kd = 0.62 ±
0.21 nM) between atrazine and the full-length R12.23 aptamer.8 In the study, an atrazine analog was first covalently
immobilized on magnetic beads, and then fluorescently labeled R12.23
was introduced in the system. R12.23 that binds to the immobilized
atrazine analog was competitively eluted out by free atrazine in solution
at the end, for signal quantification and dissociation constant calculation.8 Hickey conducted a follow-up study to investigate
the structural properties of the truncated version of R12.23 (R12.23
Trunc.).20 The same methodology was utilized
to determine the Kd to be 15.0 ±
16.5 nM. The author stated that nonspecific binding with the fluorescein
tag was the major drawback of this methodology and thus generated
the high standard deviation.20 To mitigate
this, we utilized ITC (MicroCal Auto-iTC200 by GE) to measure the Kd of R12.23 Trunc. directly in solution. In
brief, 200 μL of 100 μM atrazine was titrated into 400
μL of 10 μM R12.23 Trunc. aptamer in the sample cell at
25 °C. The Kd was estimated to be
2.58 μM based on nonlinear regression model analysis by the
companion software (Figure 1). This value indicated a much lower affinity (172 times)
than that was previously reported.20 Thermodynamic
values of the ITC experiment were evaluated to determine the validity
of the data (Table S1). The Wiseman coefficient c = n × [aptamer]/Kd, where n represents the number of binding
sites. The c value was determined to be 1.02. This
value is within the reported range of 1–1000 for reliable ITC
data.21 These data also suggested that
the binding between the aptamer and atrazine was completed at the
1:10 aptamer/ligand ratio. In our ITC experiment, the n-value was fitted as a variable to obtain reliable data. An n-value of less than 1 suggested that potential multiple
binding sites may be present on the aptamer (ligand).22 Although the heat generated from the experimental molar
ratio between the aptamer and the ligand was relatively small, it
is to be noted that an increased concentration of aptamer may lead
to an increased Kd value because of the
inter-aptamer interaction.22,23 Thus, the molar ratio
was optimal for this experiment. The potential reason for the large
differences between the newly determined Kd value and the value reported by Hickey is that the fluorescent tag
may generate a high level of nonspecific background binding as previously
noted.

CD Studies and Secondary Structure Analysis
Hickey
also reported that the binding between R12.23 Trunc. and atrazine
yielded no conformational changes in the aptamer structure in CD analysis.20 CD analysis was performed to confirm the previous
findings (Figure 2).
The CD spectra indicated a negative band at approximately 245 nm and
a positive band at approximately 270 nm. It assumed a B-form DNA structure
in the presence and absence of atrazine. The CD spectrum obtained
from this study confirmed the findings by Hickey.

Figure 2 CD analysis of R12.23
Trunc. in the presence or absence of atrazine
(ATZ: atrazine).

After the initial analysis
of the affinity and the structural conformation
of R12.23 Trunc., we noticed that both the quantitative and qualitative
binding data of R12.23 Trunc. and R12.45 Trunc. were relatively different.
The Kd value R12.23. Trunc. was 697-fold
lower than R12.45 Trunc. (Kd = 3.7 nM).17 R12.23 Trunc. also did not appear to assume
atrazine-induced B-form duplex to hairpin transition previously reported
in R12.45 Trunc.17 It is to be noted that
although both atrazine aptamers were selected from the same library
design (RMWN34), different selection strategies were employed in the
two studies. Williams et al. utilized a magnetic bead-based target
(atrazine)-immobilized selection technique. In contrast, Abraham et
al. utilized a library-immobilized selection technique (Capture-SELEX).8,17 Successful isolation of aptamer candidates in Capture-SELEX relies
on the release of the library molecule from the complementary probe
after target introduction. This library molecule detachment requirement
in the selection process is likely to have generated a different aptamer
candidate pool in comparison to the target-immobilized SELEX method.
Interestingly, the Mfold predicted that secondary structures of both
truncated aptamers contain a TTTA sequence motif in their hairpin
structures (Figure 3).24 Stem-loop and hairpin regions in
aptamers have been shown to assume binding pockets for their respective
targets.25 Thus, this TTTA sequence motif
is likely crucial in the binding interaction between the aptamer and
atrazine.

hairpin structures. (Images are generated from the free domain and

SYBR Green Displacement
Studies
After the affinity
and structural reassessment of R12.23 Trunc., we then interrogated
its in-solution binding property with SYBR Green I (SG) displacement
fluorescence assay. The assay principle is based upon measuring the
decrease in the fluorescent signal from target binding to the SG intercalated
double-stranded region in an aptamer. The SG compound has a very low
background fluorescent signal when it is not interacting with double-stranded
DNA elements. An increasing concentration of atrazine from 1 nM to
1 μM was incubated with SG treated R12.23 Trunc. After normalization
of the recorded fluorescent signal, we observed a decreasing fluorescent
signal from the baseline as the concentration of atrazine increased
(Figure 4). This suggested
that the binding of atrazine to R12.23 Trunc. displaced the intercalated
SG molecule from the double-stranded region of R12.23 Trunc. This
result was in contrast with our previous finding in R12.45 Trunc.
We previously reported that the SG fluorescent signal generated from
atrazine binding to R12.45 Trunc. followed an increased pattern from
atrazine concentration of 1–50 nM and then decreased afterward.
The normalized values of all atrazine-treated replicates were all
higher than the control baseline value.17 The different fluorescence pattern produced in the same assay setup
suggests the hypothesis that the binding of atrazine to R12.23 Trunc.
is a pure SG displacement binding without aptamer structural stabilization
(Figure S1a). This is again in contrast
to the R12.45 Trunc. structural stabilization binding pattern we reported
previously (Figure S1b).17

standard assay. Atrazine concentrations were as follows: 1, 5, 10,

signal with respect to the binding buffer. One-way ANOVA: F6,7 = 18.5, p = 0.000571.

Adsorbed Gold Nanoparticles Specificity Studies
Given
the different binding patterns we observed between R12.23 Trunc. and
R12. 45 Trunc., we further investigated the in-solution binding differences
with gold nanoparticle (AuNP) colorimetric assay, or in this case,
the adsorbed AuNP aggregation assay. Briefly, the assay principle
is based upon quantifying the red to blue-purple color change from
salt-induced AuNP aggregation. When a specific target is present in
the aptamer-coated gold nanoparticle solution, aptamer binding to
the target will desorb the aptamer from the gold nanoparticles. Addition
of salt afterward will induce a visible color shift. The changes in
visible color can be monitored with absorbance readings at 520 and
650 nm. We first subjected R12.23 Trunc. to a specificity test using
the adsorbed AuNP aggregation assay. R12.23 Trunc. generated a statistically
significant red to blue-purple colorimetric shift when subjected to
atrazine exposure (one-way ANOVA: F4,5 = 12.8, p < 0.01) (Figure 5a). All other herbicides and insecticides
tested in the assay did not generate a significant colorimetric shift.
This confirmed the specificity of the R12.23 Trunc. We then subjected
R12.45 Trunc., to the same experimental setup. In contrast, atrazine
exposure to the R12.45 Trunc.-coated AuNP did not generate any significant
shift in the absorbance measurement (one-way ANOVA: F4,5 = 3.79, p > 0.05) (Figure 5b). This result was in agreement
with our previous finding which showed that atrazine at up to 100
μM remains unable to produce a colorimetric shift.17

Adsorbed Gold Nanoparticles Affinity Studies
We further
utilized the same adsorbed AuNP aggregation assay to characterize
the binding affinity of both R12.23 Trunc. and R12.45 Trunc. at varying
atrazine concentrations (0–100 μM). R12.23 Trunc. showed
a statistically significant dose-dependent increase of red to blue-purple
colorimetric shift (one-way ANOVA: F9,10 = 5.51, p < 0.05) (Figure 6a). The assay showed a linear range from
10 nM to 50 μM, and the LOD (limited of detection) of this assay
was determined to be 174 nM (Figure S2).
However, R12.45 Trunc. did not produce any statistically significant
changes in color (one-way ANOVA: F9,10 = 1.76, p > 0.1) (Figure 6b). Two previous studies reported a similar
phenomenon where the failure in salt-induced colorimetric shift upon
target introduction to aptamer-coated gold nanoparticles was due to
target-aptamer stabilization on the AuNP surface.26,27 In brief, Chávez et al. reported the binding between riboflavin
and its corresponding aptamer stabilized the aptamer structure adsorbed
on AuNP surfaces and no salt-induced AuNP aggregation was observed.26 Smith et al. also reported that the binding
between cocaine with MN6 cocaine binding aptamer, an aptamer with
known conformational changes upon target recognition, did not generate
the salt-induced AuNPs aggregation in adsorbed AuNPs assays. On the
other hand, the author observed the salt-induced AuNPs aggregation
in the same assay setup with cocaine-bound MN4 cocaine binding aptamer,
an aptamer that does not have conformational changes upon target binding.27 Thus, the result from the aptamer-adsorbed AuNP
aggregation assay suggested the binding of atrazine to R12.23 Trunc.
led to the detachment of the aptamer from the AuNP and resulted in
salt-induced aggregation (Figure S3a).
This result also supported the qualitative CD spectrum we reported
in this study. On the other hand, the combined result of the specificity
test and atrazine standard test of R12.45 Trunc. further confirmed
our previous finding where binding of atrazine to R12.45 Trunc. stabilized
the adsorbed aptamer on the AuNP surface, thus preventing salt-induced
aggregation (Figure S3b).

Free Gold Nanoparticles Affinity Studies
Finally, we
investigated the AuNP assay with a different setup, where different
concentrations of atrazine were first incubated with a given amount
of aptamers in their binding buffers. We adopted a previously described
protocol for this assay.27 This particular
assay setup ensured the complete interaction between the two species,
before the addition of AuNP. This assay was termed the free AuNP aggregation
assay (Figure S3c). In this assay, R12.23
Trunc. again demonstrated a statistically significant dose-dependent
increase of colorimetric shift (one-way ANOVA: F9,10 = 20.3, p < 0.001) (Figure 7a). The assay showed a linear
range from 500 nM to 100 μM, and the LOD of this assay was determined
to be 4 nM (Figure S4a). Interestingly,
R12.45 Trunc. was able to produce the colorimetric shift in a dose-dependent
manner for the first time (one-way ANOVA: F9,10 = 4.9, p < 0.05) (Figure 7b). The assay also showed a linear range
from 500 nM to 100 μM, and the LOD was determined to be 5 nM
(Figure S4b).

concentration of atrazine, one-way ANOVA: F9,10 = 4.9, p < 0.05.

In the Smith study, the author reported a similar phenomenon where
both MN6 and MN4 cocaine binding aptamers were able to produce the
salt-induced colorimetric shift in their free aptamer AuNP assays.27 In our comparative study of the two atrazine
binding aptamers, it is interesting to see although R12.45 Trunc.
has a lower reported Kd value from ITC
experiments (Kd = 3.7 nM), it failed to
demonstrate observable signal changes upon atrazine recognition in
all but the free AuNP aggregation assay. On the other hand, although
R12.23 Trunc. had a higher estimated Kd from ITC experiments, the in-solution binding responses were much
more predictable. This suggests that the binding events between atrazine
and the two atrazine binding aptamers are more complicated than the
apparent affinity between the species. The calculated LODs for R12.23
Trunc. in all of the AuNP aggregation assays were lower than the estimated Kd. It has been previously reported that AuNP
assays tend to enhance the signal response due to localized SPR effects
on the gold nanoparticles and thus leads to a much lower LOD, or an
overestimated affinity.19 Madianos reported
utilizing R12.23 Trunc. as the molecular recognition element in an
impedimetric aptasensor. The author reported a linear range of responses
from 100 pM to 1 μM and a LOD at 10 pM.28 More recently, Fan et al. developed an electrochemical atrazine
aptasensor using nickel hexacyanoferrate nanoparticles and electrochemically
reduced graphene oxide.29 The author reported
using the full-length R12.23 aptamer as the binding element in the
aptasensor and obtained a linear range of response from 0.25 to 250
pM, and a LOD of 0.1 pM. These two studies demonstrated the molecular
recognition ability of R12.23 in immobilized biosensing platforms.
It also suggested that the apparent affinity of R12.23 (Trunc.) in-solution
may not directly relate to its ability to capture atrazine when it
is immobilized.

At the time this article was written, there
were no reported in-solution
biosensing platforms developed using either R12.23 Trunc. or R12.45
Trunc. However, Sun et al. have recently reported using the full-length
R12.23 aptamer in a photoelectrochemical aptasensor.30 Unmodified R12.23 aptamer was adsorbed to graphene material
to serve as the molecular beacon. The sensing principle depended upon
the detachment of the aptamer from the graphene surface and the formation
of the atrazine–aptamer complex. The authors reported ultrasensitive
detection of atrazine in water samples, with a linear range of responses
from 50 fM to 0.3 nM, and a LOD of 12 fM.30 The sensing principle of this aptasensor is similar to our results
for R12.23 Trunc. in this study. However, the spontaneous adsorption
of ssDNA with both the AuNP and graphene material is very favorable
and stable.31,32 To generate a detectable signal,
the underlying affinity and structural status between the aptamer
and the target must first be favorable enough to overcome the affinity
between the aptamer and the AuNP and graphene material, so that the
analyzing target can induce aptamer detachment from these solid surface.
Additionally, the level of aptamer adsorption and detachment must
also be finely tuned in the process. Our results suggested that the
free aptamer AuNP assay is likely to be a relatively more universal
assay for analyte detection using aptamers and AuNP. Moreover, utilizing
different aptamers in a sensing setup may also be an advantage in
overcoming the limitations of each aptamer. It is unknown if R12.45
Trunc. would perform well when it is immobilized in a biosensing platform.
A large amount of published electrochemical aptasenors utilized the
target-induced structural change property of aptamers for the electrical
or electrochemical signal generation.33 Because R12.45 Trunc. is uniquely different from R12.23 Trunc. in
terms of its structural stabilization upon atrazine binding, it is
reasonable to consider integrating R12.45 Trunc. into different biosensing
systems in future studies.

Conclusions
This
study investigated the in-solution molecular recognition properties
of two different atrazine binding aptamers. Our results elucidated
the unconventional binding profile of R12.45 Trunc. that we reported
in our previous study.17 In summary, R12.23
Trunc. binds to atrazine without conformational changes and is suitable
for in-solution biosensing assays. The binding of atrazine to R12.45
Trunc. stabilizes the aptamer secondary structure. This structural
stabilization phenomenon prevents signal responses in all but the
free AuNP aggregation assay. This key information will be crucial
in future studies that examine the sensitivity and specificity of
R12.45 Trunc. in real samples, and in the development of aptamer-based
biosensing platforms.

CD Studies
The
binding characteristics between R12.23
Trunc. and atrazine was studied in a JASCO J-1500 CD spectrophotometer
(JASCO). The binding buffer was composed of 10% v/v methanol, 100
mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris-HCl, and 2 mM MgCl2, and at pH 7.4.
Baseline was first established by scanning the binding buffer three
times with a wavelength range from 210 to 320 nm at 50 nm/min scanning
speed. The normalized spectra were obtained by averaging and subtracting
from the sample scans. R12.23 Trunc. in 10 μM concentration
dissolved in the binding buffer was scanned with the above parameter
and served as a control. The same procedure was performed with the
solution of 10 μM atrazine and 10 μM aptamer. All experiments
were scanned in a 1 mm path length quartz cuvette. Spectra data were
averaged and analyzed with the companion software from JASCO.

SG Displacement
Assay
The SG assay was performed as
adopted from a previously described method.34 Briefly, 10 μM of R12.23 Trunc. was prepared, using 10% methanol
binding buffer. The aptamer suspension was denatured by heating to
95 °C for 5 min, followed by snap cooling to 4 °C, and equilibrated
at room temperature. To perform the assay, 4 μL of 1 ×
SG was added to 10 μM of aptamer suspension with a ratio of
1 to 1. The 10% methanol binding buffer was used to prepare the atrazine
concentration from 1 nM to 1 μM. Finally, atrazine and the SG-aptamer
mixture were combined to the final volume of 125 μL. All samples
were loaded in duplicate order in a black bottom 96-well microplate
and the fluorescence signal was measured, using a FLx800 microplate
reader (BioTek) with excitation at 490 nm and emission at 520 nm.
Atrazine, SG-atrazine, and buffer with SG-aptamer were used as negative
controls. All recorded fluorescence readings were normalized with
((F – F0)/F0), where F0 was
the reading from buffer control. Three independent assays were performed
as described.

Adsorbed AuNP Aggregation Assay
The gold nanoparticles
were purchased from Nanocomposix with a manufacturer supplied specification
of an averaged particle diameter of 9.8 ± 0.8 nm at 9.5 nM particle
concentration. The adsorbed gold nanoparticle (AuNPs) assay was performed
as described previously with minor modifications.17 Briefly, 6 μL of 10 μM R12.23 Trunc. aptamer
stocked in pure water and 135 μL of AuNPs solution were mixed
and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. The mixture was centrifuged
at 13 000g for 20 min at 4 °C. All samples
were kept at the 4 °C centrifuge for an additional 15 min to
increase adsorption of the aptamer to AuNPs. The supernatant was discarded
and an aliquot of 243 μL of analytes, atrazine, fipronil, propanil,
and malathion at 1 μM dissolved in 10% methanol/water (v/v)
was combined with the aptamer–gold mixture and briefly vortexed,
followed by 15 min incubation at room temperature with rotation. The
same volume of 10% methanol/water with aptamer served as the negative
control. An aliquot of 6 μL of 1 M NaCl was added to each sample
tube and incubated for an additional 10 min at room temperature. Finally,
samples were transferred into a clear 96-well plate for absorbance
scans at 520 and 650 nm with a μQuant plate reader (BioTek).
All samples were prepared in duplicate. Three successful independent
assays were performed. The same experiment was performed to characterize
the binding activities between R12.45 Trunc. and atrazine.

The
exact experimental procedure was carried out for characterizing the
binding between R12.23 Trunc. and R12.45 Trunc. with atrazine at concentrations
from 5 nM to 100 μM in 10% methanol/water.

Free AuNP Aggregation
Assay
The free AuNP assay was
adapted from a previously described method with minor modifications.27 Briefly, 3 μL of 10 μM R12.23 Trunc.
aptamer stocked in pure water was combined with 72 μL of atrazine
at concentrations from 5 nM to 100 μM in 10% methanol/water.
The same volume of 10% methanol/water with aptamer served as the negative
control. The mixture was incubated on a rotisserie for 30 min at room
temperature for the formation of the aptamer–atrazine complex.
The solution mixture was then added to 180 μL of the same stock
of AuNP solution from Nanocomposix. After an additional 30 min of
incubation at room temperature, 6 μL of 1 M NaCl was added to
each sample tube for an additional 5 min at room temperature before
absorbance measurement. Similarly, all samples were transferred into
a clear 96-well plate for absorbance scans at 520 and 650 nm with
a μQuant plate reader (BioTek). All samples were prepared in
duplicate. Three successful independent assays were performed. The
same experiment was performed to on R12.45 Trunc. as well.
