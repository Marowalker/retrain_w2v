A gradual dementia, which leads to
the loss of memory and intellectual
abilities, is the main characteristics of Alzheimer’s disease.
Amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques are the main components that accumulate
and form clumps in the brains of people suffering from Alzheimer’s
disease. Apolipoprotein E (APOE), an amyloid-binding
protein is considered as one of the main genetic risk factor of the
late-onset Alzheimer’s disease. Different isoforms of APOE gene named APOE2, APOE3, and APOE4 are known to exist,
which differ from each other at certain positions involving single-nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs). Out of these isoforms, APOE4 increases the risk
of developing late-onset Alzheimer’s disease, whereas APOE3
is the most common among the general population. APOE4 differs from
the common APOE3 by only one nucleotide at position +2985 (T to C),
which results in immense alteration in the structure and function
of the APOE gene. A combination of gel electrophoresis
(polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, PAGE), circular dichroism (CD),
CD melting, thermal difference spectra and UV-thermal denaturation
(TM) techniques was used to investigate
the structural polymorphism associated with T → C single-nucleotide
polymorphism (SNP) at the GC-rich sequence (d-TGGAGGACGTGTGCGGCCGCCT; APOE22T). Herein, we report that APOE22T
DNA sequence switches between hairpin to antiparallel quadruplex from
low to high oligomer concentration. On the contrary, its C-counterpart
(APOE22C) forms hairpin as well as intermolecular antiparallel duplex
structure. This structural change may possibly contribute to the protein
recognition pattern, which, in turn, might control the APOE gene expression.

==== Body
Introduction
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative
disease
that has been explored as a most common form of dementia, resulting
in the depletion of memory due to loss of brain cells and intellectual
abilities among adults aged 65 or above.1 In United States, AD is considered the sixth main cause of all deaths,
and the death rate increased up to 66% between 2000 and 2008.2 Various reports suggest that instability in the
brain takes place between the production and clearance of amyloid-β
(Aβ) peptides, which leads to the accumulation and aggregation
of toxic Aβ. This toxic Aβ destroys synapses and results
in neurodegeneration and dementia.1,3

Most
of the cases of Alzheimer’s disease occurs after 65
years of age and hence it is known as late-onset Alzheimer’s
disease (LOAD). According to early reports, apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene is the major risk factor that has been associated
with LOAD.4,5 It also helps in maintaining normal cholesterol
levels by combining with lipids to form lipoproteins that remove excess
cholesterol from the blood. Increased cholesterol levels have been
found to be associated with plaques in the brain of the AD patient.
High accumulation of Aβ has been observed in rabbits taking
high-cholesterol diets. On the other hand, low cholesterol level inhibits
the generation of Aβ in mice and guinea pigs.6APOE protein is known to play a major
role in the clearance of Aβ. APOE gene exists
in three different isoforms ε2, ε3, and ε4 (APOE2,
APOE3, and APOE4) that are very well studied till now. It has been
reported that ε4 allele of the APOE gene increases
the risk of developing late-onset Alzheimer’s disease, whereas
ε3 is the most common among the general population.5,7 Frequency of ε2, ε3, and ε4 APOE alleles was found to be approximately 8.4, 77.9, and 13.7%, respectively,
worldwide. But in Alzheimer’s patients, the frequency of ε4
increases dramatically up to 40%.1

Several reports suggest that APOE4 disturbs the clearance mechanism
of Aβ, resulting in higher number of Aβ plaques in the
brain.8,9 Another report evidently shows that it is
not the binding that causes the buildup of Aβ plaques, but APOE blocks the pathway involved in the cellular degradation
and clearance of Aβ from the brain by binding to the receptor,
lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1). Aβ also competes
for the same receptor to enter the clearance pathway.10

All of the three APOE isoforms differ
by only
two nucleotide bases at positions +2985 (T/C) and +3123 (C/T). APOE3
contains thymine residue at position +2985 and cytosine residue at
position +3123. Moreover, the polymorphic version APOE4 differs from
the common ε3 type by only one nucleotide base change at position
+2985. It contains cytosine residue at position +2985 defined by SNP
rs429358, whereas APOE2 is defined by SNP rs7412, which contains thymine
residue at position +3123.11,12 These changes can immensely
alter the structure and function of APOE gene and
modify its ability to bind lipids, receptors, and Aβ. It has
become extremely essential to gather more knowledge about the modifications,
which occur in the mechanism involved in the regulation of APOE gene, due to single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) site.

The detailed characterization of SNP sites involved in different
human diseases is extremely significant for understanding the mechanisms
involved in gene regulation. Structural difference between these polymorphic
sites would have consequence in vivo, and an in-depth knowledge of
their structural and physical properties is of crucial importance.
Keeping in mind the above facts, we have aimed to investigate the
effect of SNP on the secondary structures adapted by APOE3 and APOE4
polymorphic sequences. Using biophysical and biochemical methods,
we studied a 22-mer sequence [d(TGGAGGACGTGTGCGGCCGCCT); APOE22T] found in the coding region (exon 4) of APOE gene representing ε3 allele and its SNP counterpart
[d(TGGAGGACGTGCGCGGCCGCCT); APOE22C] representing
ε4 allele.

Results and Discussion
In this paper,
bioinformatic, biochemical, and biophysical studies
of 22-mer sequences (APOE22T, d-TGGAGGACGTGTGCGGCCGCCT and its SNP version APOE22C, d-TGGAGGACGTGCGCGGCCGCCT) have been carried out for their structural determination.
Bioinformatic analysis revealed that APOE22T sequence is present in
the Exon 4 region of APOE gene. The diagrammatic
representation of three isoforms of APOE gene is
shown in Figure 1.
In this report, we investigated the structures formed by the sequences
APOE22T and APOE22C under physiological pH and salt conditions. The
hairpin and antiparallel bimolecular G-quadruplex structural models
were proposed for APOE22T at different oligomer concentrations, whereas
APOE22C was found to form hairpin as well as duplex structures at
all of the oligomer concentrations.

of APOE gene.

Nondenaturating Gel Electrophoresis
The molecularity
of the DNA structures can be established by carrying out native polyacrylamide
gel electrophoresis.13 A 15% gel electrophoretogram
having the DNA samples of APOE22T as well as APOE22C along with their
duplexes was run in 20 mM sodium cacodylate buffer (pH 7.4) containing
100 mM NaCl and 0.1 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA, Figure 2a). 12-mer and 24-mer
duplex (PAL12 and PAL24) as well as 35-mer single-stranded random
sequence (M35) were used as control size markers. In lane 1, PAL12
(fast-moving band) and PAL24 (slow-moving band) migrated as 24-nt
and 48-nt sequence, respectively, as both are palindromic sequences
and hence form perfect duplexes. Control marker M35 moves as a 35-mer
single strand only (lane 6). Lane 2 showed a single band for APOE22T
oligomer at 10 μM concentration, which moves slightly lower
than the control marker PAL12. On comparative analysis with control,
the single band of APOE22T was assigned to the hairpin form. On the
other hand, APOE22C sequence (lane 3) showed two distinct bands at
the same oligomer concentration, out of which the lower band migrates
equivalent to 22-mer hairpin structure of APOE22T, whereas the upper
band migrates slightly faster than the 24-mer duplex (PAL24), suggesting
the presence of hairpin as well as intermolecular duplex structures.
When added in equimolar ratio with their complementary strands, both
[APOE22T + APOE22Tc] and [APOE22C + APOE22Cc] (lanes 4 and 5) showed
a single band, indicating the presence of a perfect duplex, moving
parallel to the slower band of APOE22C (lane 3), which also confirmed
the formation of bimolecular structure by APOE22C sequence.

Oligomer Concentration
Dependence in Gel Electrophoresis
Furthermore, to check the
effect of increasing oligomer strand concentrations
on the structure and molecularity of the studied GC-rich oligonucleotides,
15% native gel electrophoresis experiments were performed in 20 mM
sodium cacodylate buffer (pH 7.4), 100 mM NaCl, and 0.1 mM EDTA. Figure 2b shows the effect
of increasing (from 10, 20, 30, and 40 μM) oligomer concentration
of APOE22T on its secondary structure. PAL12 (fast-moving band, lane
1), PAL24 (slow-moving band, lane 1), and [M35 + M35c] (lane 6) migrate
as 12-, 24-, and 70-mer perfect duplex, respectively. The electrophoretogram
showed a single band for APOE22T at 10, 20, and 30 μM (lanes
2, 3, and 4, respectively) oligomer concentrations, which migrated
slightly faster than the 12-mer duplex of PAL12, suggesting the presence
of an intramolecular species or a hairpin structure. Quite interestingly,
as the strand concentration reached 40 μM (lane 5), two bands
were observed. The mobility of both the bands of APOE22T was slightly
retarded than that of the bands of PAL12 and PAL24, respectively.
This confirmed the formation of a hairpin and a bimolecular structure
by APOE22T at a higher oligomer concentration, i.e., 40 μM.

Similarly, Figure 2c depicts the gel electrophoretogram of APOE22C in increasing (from
10, 20, 30, and 40 μM) oligomer concentrations. It is clear
from the figure that there is no change in the structural status of
APOE22C at various oligomer concentrations, as it showed two bands
exactly similar to that of the previous gel (Figure 2a, lane 3). These two bands suggested the
formation of a hairpin (fast-moving band) and a duplex (slow-moving
band) structure.

For confirming the exact status of the secondary
structures adapted
by studied DNA sequences, circular dichroism and UV-thermal melting
studies were also performed, which have been discussed in the following
sections.

Circular Dichroism Studies
The CD spectra of the studied
DNA oligonucleotides were recorded to study the conformation adopted
by the secondary structures of these sequences. Figure 3a shows the CD spectra of APOE22T and APOE22C
at 3 μM strand concentration in 20 mM sodium cacodylate buffer
(pH 7.4) comprising 100 mM NaCl and 0.1 mM EDTA. Both APOE22T and
APOE22C displayed a strong positive peak at 287 nm and a strong negative
peak at 249 nm, which are the characteristic CD signatures of B-form
of DNA.13,14

cacodylate buffer

increasing oligomer concentration in 100 mM NaCl. (c) CD spectra of
APOE22C in increasing oligomer concentration in 100 mM NaCl.

Oligomer Concentration
Dependence in CD Studies
Because
the results obtained from oligomer dependence in gel electrophoresis
experiments suggested the formation of a new structure at a high oligomer
concentration in case of APOE22T, further CD experiments were performed
to get more clarity on the same. The CD spectra of APOE22T and APOE22C
in 20 mM sodium cacodylate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 100 mM NaCl
and 0.1 mM EDTA were recorded at the increasing oligomer concentrations
of 4, 10, 20, and 30 μM and are displayed in Figure 3b,c, respectively. With the
increase in the oligomer concentration, the CD spectra of APOE22T
in Figure 3b shows
an appearance of new positive peak around 295 nm at higher oligomer
concentrations, which is a characteristic of the antiparallel guanine
quadruplex. Gel experiments from previous section indicated that at
a higher oligomer concentration of APOE22T, two species exist. The
new species was suggested to have a bimolecular structure, which might
be guanine quadruplex with antiparallel conformation, as indicated
by the CD studies also.

Figure 3c shows the CD spectra of APOE22C at different oligomer
concentrations, which indicates an increase in the ellipticity of
positive peak at 286 nm with the increase in the oligomer concentration
from 4 to 20 μM, signifying an increment in the population of
the hairpin as well as duplex structure formed by the APOE22C sequence.
At 30 μM oligomer concentration, shift in the wavelength from
286 to 289 nm can be seen along with the increase in the ellipticity.
This indicates that at a higher oligomer concentration, the duplex
structure is more in population as compared to hairpin structure and
is predominantly a B-form of duplex.

CD Melting Studies of APOE22T
Denaturation of DNA can
also be investigated by studying the temperature-induced changes in
CD, which is known as CD melting. The CD melting profiles of APOE22T
at lower (4 μM) and higher (30 μM) oligomer concentration
were investigated at wavelengths 286 and 295 nm, respectively, which
displayed maximum ellipticity in Figure 3b. The samples were prepared in 20 mM sodium
cacodylate buffer (pH 7.4), 100 mM NaCl, and 0.1 mM EDTA solution.

Figure 4 displays
the monophasic melting profiles for APOE22T at 4 and 30 μM oligomer
concentrations with constant TM value
72 °C. No significant difference was observed between the melting
profiles of APOE22T at lower and higher oligomer concentrations. This
observation suggests the melting of a unimolecular hairpin structure,
which shows the oligomer concentration independence in melting (similar
results were obtained in case of UV-thermal melting too; Figure 6b). The melting of
G-quadruplex structure could not be observed in this CD melting, which
may be because of the very low concentration of G-quadruplex species
in the solution.

concentrations
in 100 mM NaCl.

UV-Thermal Melting Studies
By utilizing UV spectroscopy,
the thermal melting studies were carried out, which describe the melting
stability of the sequences under study. An absorbance versus temperature
profile was recorded at 260 nm to determine the melting temperature
(TM) at which half of the DNA structure
unwinds.15Figure 5a,b shows the denaturation curves attributed
to APOE22T and APOE22C, respectively, in 20 mM sodium cacodylate buffer
(pH 7.4) having 100 mM NaCl and 0.1 mM EDTA. The melting curve of
APOE22T at 3 μM strand concentration is monophasic, indicating
the unwinding of single structural species and its TM value of 73 °C, which was determined by first derivative
curve. The monophasic melting profile of APOE22T correlates well with
the gel electrophoresis study (showing only one band for the sequence),
thus suggesting the formation of a hairpin structure only. Further,
the melting curve of APOE22C also displayed a monophasic curve with TM value of 72 °C.

Figure 5 (a) Thermal denaturation
profile of APOE22T with a derivative curve
in 100 mM NaCl. (b) Thermal denaturation profile of APOE22C with derivative
curve in 100 mM NaCl.

The gel experiment (Figure 2) demonstrated the presence of two structural species
of variable
molecularity, but the biphasic thermal transition was not observed
in UV melting studies. On correlating gel and thermal studies, it
can be inferred that the TM of 72 °C
might be due to the denaturation of an intramolecular species, i.e.,
hairpin structure. It can also be assumed that the duplex structure
(slow-moving band of lane 3, Figure 2) formed by APOE22C might be low in concentration as
compared to the hairpin structure (major species) at low oligomer
concentration of sequence in thermal melting experiments. As a consequence,
a prominent TM curve is not detected for
the denaturation of minor species at a low strand concentration.

Oligomer Concentration Dependence of APOE22C
It is
clear from the thermal melting experiments discussed above (Figure 5a,b) that the melting
of bimolecular structure could not be detected at low strand concentration,
so an oligomer concentration dependence in UV-thermal melting was
carried out to investigate the formation of the bimolecular structure
by APOE22C. Similar buffer conditions were employed to carry out the
oligomer concentration dependence studies. The melting profiles displayed
in Figure 6a are of APOE22C at various strand concentrations.
The thermal melting curves were monophasic at low strand concentration,
but as the oligomer concentration increased, the monophasic curve
turned into biphasic transition, revealing the melting of two different
species. The TM of lower temperature transition
was increased with increase in oligomer concentration (from 4 to 30
μM), whereas the TM of higher transition
remained constant. The lower transition was found to be highly dependent
on oligomer concentration, whereas the upper transition was independent
of oligomer concentration. This also confirmed that the lower transition
is due to an intermolecular species, i.e., duplex, whereas the upper
transition is due to the thermal melting of an intramolecular species,
i.e., hairpin. It can be clearly seen that the melting curve at 30
μM strand concentration was distinctly biphasic, having the TM values of 50 °C (lower transition) and
73 °C (upper transition). The lower transition corresponds to
the bimolecular structure, whereas the upper melting transition was
attributed to the hairpin structure. The heating as well as cooling
curves of APOE22C were monitored at 260 nm to establish the existence
of thermodynamically stable species. The heating and cooling curves
depicted in Figure 7c,d are found to be superimposed on each other (absence of hysteresis),
which show that the structures formed by APOE22C sequence are thermodynamically
stable.

oligomer concentration. (b) Thermal denaturation profiles of APOE22T

nm. (c) Heating and cooling curves of APOE22C (10 μM) at 260
nm. (d) Heating and cooling curves of APOE22C (30 μM) at 260

Oligomer Concentration
Dependence of APOE22T
To confirm
the molecularity and structures of the secondary structures, oligomer
concentration dependence was also performed in UV-thermal melting
experiments. Because the melting of bimolecular structure could not
be detected at low strand concentrations, so an oligomer concentration
dependence study was carried out on APOE22T sequence in 20 mM sodium
cacodylate buffer (pH 7.4), 100 mM NaCl, and 0.1 mM EDTA solution. Figure 6b shows the thermal
melting profiles of APOE22T at 260 nm. At low oligomer concentration
(4 μM), a monophasic curve is obtained at 260 nm with a melting
temperature of 73 °C. With an increase in oligomer concentration
from 4 to 10, 20, and 30 μM, biphasic curves were observed,
indicating the presence of two different structures. It signifies
that APOE22T forms a unimolecular (hairpin) structure at low oligomer
concentration and the sequence folds to form hairpin as well as bimolecular
structures as the concentration is increased further. The melting
temperature of the hairpin structure (upper transition) does not change
with increasing oligomer concentration. On the contrary, the melting
temperature (TM) of the bimolecular structure
increased from 45 to 58 °C with an increase in oligomer concentration
from 10 to 30 μM, respectively.

Also, most significantly,
all of the melting profiles of APOE22T were found to be inverted at
295 nm, indicating the formation of a G-quadruplex structure at higher
oligomer concentration (Figure 6c). On correlating all of the experimental results, it was
concluded that the APOE22T adapted a bimolecular antiparallel G-quadruplex
structure at a high oligomer concentration. Here also, the heating
as well as cooling curves of APOE22T were monitored at 260 nm wavelength
and are shown in Figure 7a,b. The phenomenon of hysteresis was detected in APOE22T, which
shows that the G-quadruplex structure formed by APOE22T at a higher
oligomer concentration is thermodynamically unstable. At 295 nm, the
inverted melting profiles (heating and cooling) are not superimposed,
supporting the presence of hysteresis (data not shown).

Thermal Difference
Spectra (TDS)
Thermal Difference
Spectra (TDS) were investigated to obtain an insight into the structure
adopted by the studied DNA sequences. The difference in the absorbance
spectra at high and low temperatures gives a specific signature for
DNA secondary structure. Figure 8 shows the TDS spectra of APOE22T and APOE22C at low
(4 μM) and high (30 μM) oligomer concentrations. The positive
peaks around 275 and 240 nm are obtained in case of APOE22T at 4 μM
concentration, which is a specific TDS signature for the DNA duplex
with 100% GC content.16 The TDS spectra
of APOE22T (4 μM) correlates well with other biophysical and
biochemical studies. On the basis of that finding, it was concluded
that the sequence forms a hairpin structure at low oligomer concentration.
However, at high oligomer concentration (30 μM) of APOE22T,
positive peaks around 275 and 243 nm are obtained, matching with the
TDS signature of G-quadruplex. The TDS profile of APOE22T at a higher
oligomer concentration does not show a negative peak around 295 nm,
which might be due to the long loops of the quadruplex formed. Similarly,
Mergny et al. (2010)27 demonstrated that
a sequence containing T15 in the loop (E3E) showed a very small negative
peak at 295 nm in the TDS spectra. G-quadruplex structure formed by
E3E sequence contains a large number of residues in the loop, causing
a very low magnitude of the negative peak at 295 nm in TDS spectra.17

Figure 8 TDS spectra of APOE22T and APOE22C at low (4 μM)
and high
(30 μM) oligomer concentrations in 100 mM NaCl.

Apart from this, CD and TM studies
show that the stability of bimolecular G-quadruplex structure (minor
species) is very low at low oligomer concentration. The proposed structural
model (Figure 9) shows
that the bimolecular G-quadruplex structure involves only two G-tetrads,
which are also attributed to its lower stability. We conclude that
due to low concentrations and less thermal stability of G-quadruplex
structure, detecting the significant TDS spectra for G-quadruplex
structure was not possible. Also, the possibility of the formation
of Hoogsteen duplex by APOE22T instead of G-quadruplex is excluded,
as the TDS spectra did not match with that of the Hoogsteen duplex.16

Figure 9 Proposed models of APOE22T and APOE22C.

The TDS spectra of APOE22C at low (4 μM)
and high (30 μM)
oligomer concentrations give positive peaks around 275 and 237 nm
(Figure 8), exhibiting
the presence of a DNA duplex-like structure. The TDS spectra of APOE22C
correlate well with other experimental results demonstrating the formation
of hairpin as well as antiparallel duplex structures.

Proposed Structures
for the Sequences
A significant
correlation had been noticed in the gel electrophoresis, circular
dichroism, and thermal melting studies of the sequences under study.
Structural models of hairpin and duplex structures for APOE22T and
APOE22C sequences are illustrated in Figure 9. APOE22T oligomer folds back to form a hairpin
structure containing six G–C base pairs in the stem and the
tetranucleotide −TGTG– in the loop. The loop region
containing four to five unpaired bases has been reported to increase
the stability as compared to smaller or larger loops. DNA hairpins
containing four to five nucleotides in the loop region have the potential
to increase the stacking interactions in addition to decreased steric
hindrance.18,19 Loops containing less number
of bases have also been reported.20,21 The presence
of a G–C base pair adjacent to the loop contributes to the
overall stability of the hairpin structure containing two or three
bases in the loop region.22 Kaushik et
al. in 2003 have even reported the formation of a hairpin structure
with one base loop by a quasi-palindromic sequence.23,24

In addition to the hairpin structure, APOE22T formed an antiparallel
bimolecular G-quadruplex structure, which has two guanine quartets,
at a high oligomer concentration (Figure 9). It is already reported that the G-quadruplex
structures with three G-tetrads are more favorable as compared to
G-quadruplex containing two G-tetrads, but several reports have investigated
the formation of G-quadruplex structures involving even only two G-tetrads.25−27 The stability of this structure is attributed to six Watson–Crick
hydrogen bonds and two guanine–guanine interactions.

On the other hand, in the SNP version, APOE22C exists in two structural
forms, hairpin and intermolecular duplex. The hairpin structure obtained
for APOE22C comprises a tetranucleotide loop having TGCG bases. The
single base change (from T to C) does not affect the stability of
the hairpin structure to a large extent, but an additional antiparallel
duplex structure is formed in the APOE22C sequence, which has cytosine
in place of thymine. The C-counterpart of the sequence results in
an increase in the G–C base pairs, leading to the formation
of a duplex containing fourteen G–C base pairs and six mismatched
base pairs.

Conclusions
In the present report,
ε3 and ε4 isoforms of APOE gene at the
SNP site were investigated to see if the
structural difference at gene level is also reflected at nucleotide
level. The knowledge may give insight into the occurrence of late-onset
Alzheimer’s disease. With the help of several biophysical and
biochemical techniques such as gel electrophoresis, circular dichroism,
and thermal melting studies, it was concluded that APOE22T forms a
stable hairpin structure at low oligomer concentration, whereas it
adapts an antiparallel quadruplex at higher concentrations. In contrast,
its C-counterpart, APOE22C, forms a duplex as well as hairpin structure
irrespective of the oligomer concentrations. The CD profile of both
the sequences showed an oligomeric concentration dependence. With
an increase in oligomer concentration, the CD profiles of APOE22T
showed a switch from hairpin to antiparallel guanine quadruplex, whereas
APOE22C exhibited the development of more significant characteristics
of the B-form of DNA. The CD melting profiles of APOE22T at low and high oligomer
concentration is somewhat similar, exhibiting that the melting of
only the hairpin structure is a major species. We conclude that the
antiparallel G-quadruplex structure has a very low stability due to
which it is not detectable in the CD melting experiment. Biphasic
thermal transitions confirmed the melting of intermolecular duplex
and hairpin structure in the case of APOE22C. Inverted melting profiles
at 295 nm confirmed the formation of antiparallel quadruplex by APOE22T
at a high oligomer concentration. The hysteresis observed in heating
and cooling curves of APOE22T again supports the low stability of
the structures formed by the sequence. On the other hand, hysteresis
is not observed in the case of APOE22C, which confirms that the structures
formed by the APOE22C sequence are thermodynamically stable. The TDS
spectra of APOE22C support the formation of hairpin as well as antiparallel
duplex structures, whereas the TDS spectra of APOE22T only show the
formation of hairpin structure and do not show the significant signature
of G-quadruplex at a high oligomer concentration. The proposed structural
models correlate well with the biochemical and biophysical studies
performed in this paper.

Materials and Method
The DNA oligonucleotides
were purchased from Bio Basic Inc., Canada,
as PAGE purified lyophilized powder and synthesized on the 1 μmol
scale. These DNA oligonucleotides were stored at −20 °C.
The nearest-neighbor method was employed to calculate the extinction
coefficient (ε) followed by the determination of the concentration
of oligonucleotides spectrophotometrically by measuring the absorbance
at 260 nm. To prepare the stock solutions of the oligomers used, lyophilized
powder was directly dissolved in the MilliQ water. All of the other
chemicals were of analytical grade and purchased from Sigma Chemicals.
The DNA oligomers used under the present study and their complementary
sequences along with their extinction coefficients
are listed in Table 1.

Nondenaturating Gel Electrophoresis
Nondenaturating
gel electrophoresis was performed with the oligonucleotide samples
in 20 mM sodium cacodylate buffer (pH 7.4) and 0.1 mM EDTA containing
100 mM NaCl. The final volume of the sample was 20 μL. Furthermore,
to check the purity of these oligomers, a 20% denaturating PAGE using
7 M urea was made to run before carrying out the native gel studies.
All of the studied DNA oligonucleotides migrated as single-stranded
species in denaturating PAGE, confirming the 100% purity of the sample.
To carry out the nondenaturating gel experiments, the samples were
heated at 95 °C for 5 min and slowly cooled to room temperature.
The oligonucleotide (at 10 μM strand concentration) samples
were incubated at 4 °C overnight before loading onto 15% polyacrylamide
gel. The gel was pre-equilibrated at 4 °C for about 1 h. The
gel comprises 20 mM sodium cacodylate buffer (pH 7.4) with 100 mM
NaCl and 0.1 mM EDTA. On the other hand, the running buffer contained
1× TBE with the same concentration of NaCl and EDTA. The tracking
dye consisted of an equimolar mixture of orange G and glycerol. The
gels were run at a constant voltage of 65 V in a cold room (∼4
°C). After electrophoresis, the gel was stained with stains-all
solution and visualized under white light and photographed by Alphalmager
2200 (Alpha InfotechCorpn.).

Circular Dichroism
To gather information
about conformational
status of APOE22T and APOE22C oligonucleotides, circular dichroism
(CD) spectroscopy was used. The CD spectra were recorded on a JASCO-815
spectropolarimeter. An average of three scans was taken over a wavelength
range of 200–320 nm at a scanning rate of 100 nm/min. The buffer
solution was scanned alone at room temperature and subtracted from
the average scans for each oligonucleotide sample. The samples were
scanned in a 1 cm path length quartz cuvette of 1 mL volume capacity.
The data were collected in units of millidegrees versus wavelength
and normalized to the total DNA strand concentration. The CD spectroscopy
was also used to investigate the melting temperature of the GC-rich
sequence. The temperature versus ellipticity profiles were monitored
by heating the samples from 5 to 95 °C at a rate of 0.5 °C/min.

UV-Thermal Denaturation
The UV-thermal denaturation
experiments of DNA oligonucleotide sequences were performed on a UV-2450PC
Shimadzu UV–visible spectrophotometer equipped with a Peltier
thermo-programmer, TMS PC-8(E) 200, and interfaced with a Pentium
IV computer for data collection and analysis. The stoppered quartz
cuvettes of 1 and 0.1 cm optical pathlength with 110 and 35 μL
volume, respectively, were used for the measurements. The samples
were prepared by taking a desired strand concentration. After that
they were heated at 95 °C for 5 min followed by slow cooling
and then kept overnight at 4 °C. The temperature versus the absorbance
profiles were monitored at 265 nm by heating the samples from 20 to
95 °C at a rate of 0.5 °C/min. The thermal melting temperature
(TM) was determined from the peak of the
first derivative of the thermal denaturation profile generated by
computer. The accuracy of the reported TM values is ±1 °C. Heating from 20 to 95 °C at a rate
of 0.5 °C/min and cooling from 95 to 20 °C at a rate of
0.5 °C/min experiments were also performed to detect the existence
of hysteresis in the secondary structures formed by GC-rich oligonucleotides.

Thermal Difference Spectra (TDS)
The TDS were recorded
on a UV-2450PC Shimadzu UV–visible spectrophotometer. The stoppered
quartz cuvette of 35 μL volume and 0.1 cm path length was used
for the experiment. The samples of desired concentrations were prepared
by using 20 mM sodium cacodylate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 100 mM
NaCl and 0.1 mM EDTA solution. After that, they were heated at 95
°C for 5 min followed by slow cooling and then kept overnight
at 4 °C. The wavelength versus absorbance curves were monitored
at 20 °C as well as at 90 °C. To obtain the TDS, the spectrum
at 20 °C was subtracted from that at 90 °C.
