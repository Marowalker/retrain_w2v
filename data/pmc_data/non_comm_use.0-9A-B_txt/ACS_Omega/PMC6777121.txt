A new synthetic method to grow O-deficient
rutile TiO2(s) nanorods (NRs) and nanowires (NWs) by a
vapor–solid reaction
growth method is developed. TiCl4(g) was employed to react
with commercially supplied CaTiO3(s) (size 2–4 μm)
at 973 K under atmospheric pressure to generate TiO2(s) NRs (diameters 80–120 nm, lengths 1–4 μm). The
reaction employing TiCl4(g) and CaO(s) at 973
K also generated CaTiO3(s) (size 4–13 μm)
as the intermediate which reacted further with TiCl4(g) to produce NWs (diameters 80–120 nm, lengths 4–15
μm). This is the first report of 1D rutile TiO2(s) nanostructure with such a high aspect ratio. Both of the NRs and
the NWs, with compositions TiO1.81 and TiO1.65, respectively, were single crystals grown in the [001] direction.
Their morphology was affected by the reaction temperature, the concentration
of TiCl4(g), and the particle size of CaTiO3(s). The NRs and the NWs were investigated as anode materials for Li+-ion batteries. At constant current rates 1, 2, and 5 C (1
C = 170 mA g–1) for 100 cycles, the cycling (1.0–3.0
V) performance data of the NRs were 146, 123, and 104 mA h g–1, respectively. On the other hand, the cycling performance data of
the NWs were 120, 80, and 52 mA h g–1, respectively.
This is attributed to the high Li+ ion diffusion rate (DLi+) of the NRs (29.52 × 10–15 cm2 s–1), which exceeds
that of the NWs (8.61 × 10–15 cm2 s–1). Although the [001] growth direction of the
NR crystals would provide the fastest channels for the diffusion of
Li+ ions and enhance the battery capacity, the extremely
long channels in the NWs could hamper the diffusion of the Li+ ions. The O-deficiency in the structure would increase the
conductivity of the electrode material and improve the stable cycling
stability of the batteries also. The long-term cycling test at 2 C
for the battery constructed from the NRs retained 121 mA h g–1 after 200 cycles and 99.2 mA h g–1 after 800 cycles.
The device has an excellent long-term cycling stability with a loss
of only 0.04% per cycle.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Metal
oxides are very important solid materials for energy storage
applications because of their good chemical stability, nontoxicity,
and low cost.1,2 For example, anatase TiO2(s) can be employed as an anode material for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs)
because of the following major advantages.3,4 First,
it demonstrates excellent Li+ ion insertion/extraction
reversibility. Also, its volume expansion during repeated cycling
shows a negligible value of 3–4%, so that the mechanical degradation
of the electrode material can be avoided.5,6 Furthermore,
LIBs can be operated at a relatively high voltage (>1 V vs Li+/Li), which reduces the formation of the solid-electrolyte
interphase on the anodes.7,8 In addition to anatase
TiO2(s), other major phases, such as rutile and brookite,
are intensively investigated.9 Among them,
the rutile phase is generally regarded as the most thermodynamically
stable one.10 However, bulk rutile TiO2(s) is a poor electron conductor (10–13 S
cm–1). Because Li+ ion intercalation
into the crystal lattice is anisotropic, that is, 10–6 cm2 s–1 along the c-axis but 10–15 cm2 s–1 along the ab-plane, the phenomenon limits the storage
capacity of the devices.11−13 To increase the performance and
to improve the cycle stability, nano-sized electrode material could
be incorporated to reduce the Li+ ion diffusion path (equilibrium
time: τeq = L2/2DLi+, L: diffusion
length, and DLi+: diffusion
coefficient) and to provide more space to alleviate the structural
strain.14 Another effective method is to
increase the Ti3+ and the O vacancy concentrations in the
TiO2(s) structure to improve the conductivity.15,16

Here, we report employing low-cost TiCl4(g) to
react
with commercially supplied perovskite CaTiO3(s) via a simple
one-step vapor–solid reaction growth (VSRG) method to prepare
single crystalline rutile TiO2(s) nanorods (NRs). In addition,
we also discover that the reaction between TiCl4(g) and
CaO(s) generated CaTiO3(s). The perovskite intermediate
reacts further with TiCl4(g) to produce unusually long
(>15 μm) high aspect ratio single crystalline rutile TiO2(s) nanowires (NWs). Even though the process is an improvement
of a previously reported VSRG route, to our knowledge, the observation
is the first report of rutile TiO2 in this morphology.17 The as-prepared TiO2(s) NRs and NWs
structures are O-deficient and show excellent electrochemical behavior
as the anode material in LIBs.

2 Result and Discussion
2.1 Preparation and Characterization of Rutile
TiO2(s) NRs
Through a new VSRG route, TiCl4(g) was reacted with commercially supplied CaTiO3(s) (size 2–4 μm) for 20 h in a hot-wall reactor at 973
K to generate a blue solid product (Figure S1a in the Supporting Information). The size of the reactant
CaTiO3(s) influences the product morphology greatly and
will be discussed more below. As shown by the X-ray diffraction (XRD)
pattern in Figure S1b, the product was
identified to be rutile TiO2(s) embedded in a matrix of
CaCl2(s) (Joint Committee of Powder Diffraction Standard,
JCPDS no. 21-1276 and 74-0992).18,19 After CaCl2(s) was removed by washing the solid product with deionized (DI) water,
pure rutile TiO2(s) (P973) was isolated. P973 and other
samples investigated are summarized in Table S1 in the Supporting Information. The scanning electron
microscopic (SEM) images of P973 (Figure 1a,b) display the presence of numerous NRs
(widths 80–120 nm and lengths 1–4 μm). The electron-dispersive
X-ray spectrum (EDX) of P973, shown in Figure 1c, indicates that the sample contains both
Ti and O elements. The XRD pattern (Figure 1d) does not show signals from the residual
CaTiO3(s) reactant (JCPDS no. 22-153). This confirms that
P973 is pure rutile TiO2(s). A transmission electron microscopic
(TEM) image in Figure 1e shows an individual NR with a length 1.2 μm and a width 80
nm. From the high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image presented in Figure 1f, the spacings are
estimated to be 0.29 and 0.20 nm and assigned to the (0 0 1) and (2
1 0) planes of rutile TiO2(s), respectively.20 The selected-area electron diffraction (SAED)
image of P973 displays a dot pattern in Figure 1g.21 This reveals
that the sample is a single crystal with the zone axis indexed to
be [−1 2 0] of rutile TiO2(s).

TEM images, and (g) SAED of P973.

To further investigate the chemical states of the surface elements
of P973, X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) of the sample were taken.
As shown in the survey spectrum in Figure S2, the sample displays signals from Ti and O atoms majorly. In addition,
signals from traces of C, Cl, and Ca elements are observed. In Figure 2a, the high resolution
spectra of P973 are presented. Figure 2a shows two major peaks at 458.1 and 463.8 eV from
2P3/2 and 2P1/2 electrons of Ti4+ atoms on the surface, respectively.22 Two shoulder peaks at 457.1 and 463.3 eV are attributed to 2P3/2 and 2P1/2 electrons of Ti3+ atoms,
respectively.23 A semi-quantitative analysis
of the peak intensities suggests a Ti3+/Ti4+ ratio of 0.10. The presence of Ti3+ sites suggests that
the NRs may be deficient in O atoms. Figure 2b shows the XPS of the O 1s electrons at
529.1 and 531.4 eV.23 They are assigned
to the O atoms of TiO2(s) and those of the surface OH groups.24Figure 2c displays two signals of Ca 2P1/2 and 2P3/2 electrons at 354.5 and 347.2 eV, respectively.25Figure 2d indicates weak Cl 2P1/2 and 2P3/2 peaks at
200.2 and 198.1 eV, respectively.26 They
are assigned to a trace amount of the unremoved CaCl2 byproduct
in the sample.

After successfully obtaining the one-dimensional (1D) TiO2(s) NRs, we explored the factors that influenced the crystal growth.
These factors include reaction time, precursor concentration, reaction
temperature, and CaTiO3(s) size. The data of the samples
grown from reactions carried out at 973 K for 5–20 h are shown
in Figures S3 and S4 in the Supporting Information. The XRD reflections from rutile TiO2(s) were observed
after 5 h (Figure S3). As the reaction
time prolongs, the CaTiO3(s) signals decreased while the
rutile signals increased. After 20 h, CaTiO3(s) was completely
converted into rutile TiO2(s). The SEM study in Figure S4 shows the growth of NRs and the diminishing
of the original particles. After 20 h, particles no longer existed
while numerous clusters of NRs were observed. The NR growth was affected
by the TiCl4(g) concentration in the vapor phase also,
as suggested by the XRD and the SEM analyses shown in Figures S5 and S6, respectively. By adjusting
the TiCl4(l) bubbling rates (1–4 bubbles s–1), the XRD analyses in Figure S5 confirm
that CaTiO3(s) was fully converted to pure rutile TiO2(s) after the reaction was carried out at 973 K for 20 h.
As demonstrated in the SEM images in Figure S6, the sizes and the uniformity of the as-produced NRs increased as
the TiCl4(l) bubbling rates were increased. As shown in Figure S6c, the NRs with widths 320–400
nm and lengths 2–4 μm were isolated from the reaction
employing the highest concentration of TiCl4(g). This product
is P973, which is mentioned above. The reaction temperature influenced
the product morphology greatly. As the reaction temperature was increased
from 923 to 1023 K, the XRD patterns in Figure S7 confirm the formation of the rutile phase TiO2(s) in all experiments. The corresponding SEM images in Figure S8 display their morphology. Isolated
from the reaction carried out at 923 K, P923 was obtained. As presented
in Figure S8a,b, it contained irregularly
shaped particles (100–300 nm). P973 was the product obtained
from the reaction performed at 973 K. As discussed above, the NR-shaped
particles display widths of 80–120 nm and lengths of 1–4
μm in Figures 1a,b and S8c,d. For the product collected
from the reaction performed at 1023 K (P1023), the particle width
increased further to 600–800 nm (Figure S8e,f). The last important factor which influences the product
morphology is the particle size of the reactant CaTiO3(s). This will be discussed further below.

2.2 Preparation
and Characterization of Rutile
TiO2(s) NWs
As reported previously, we discovered
that in the reaction between CaO(s) and TiCl4(g) at 973 K for 36 h, a dark blue product composed of rutile TiO2(s) and CaCl(s) was obtained (Figure S9).17 After the removal
of the byproduct CaCl2(s), the sample was named C973 and
identified to be bundles of rutile TiO2(s) NWs with lengths
exceeding 10 μm (Figure S10). The
detailed images of C973 are exhibited in Figure 3. The SEM image in Figure 3a indicates that C973 contained numerous
NWs with widths 80–140 nm and lengths 4–15 μm.
The TEM image (Figure 3b) of a NW isolated from C973 shows a length of 11 μm and a
width of 80 nm. From the HRTEM image shown in Figure 3c, the spaces between two sets of parallel
fringes of the crystalline structure are measured to be 0.29 and 0.32
nm. They correspond to the spacings of the (0 0 1) and (1 1 0) planes
of rutile TiO2(s), respectively. The SAED image shows a
dot pattern in Figure 3d.20 It suggests that the single crystal
sample can be indexed to the [−1 1 0] zone axis of rutile TiO2(s). The XPS survey spectrum of C973 is shown in Figure S11. In Figure S12a, two major peaks at 457.4 and 463.1 eV from Ti4+ 2P3/2 and 2P1/2 electrons are observed, respectively.
Also, after curve fittings, two shoulder peaks at 457.1 and 462.5
eV are attributed to Ti3+ 2P3/2 and 2P1/2 electrons, respectively. The molar ratio of Ti3+/Ti4+ ions in C973, determined by semi-quantitative analyses of
the peak intensities, is 0.33. Figure S12b shows the XPS signals of O 1s electrons at 529.4 and 531.8 eV.23 They are assigned to the O atoms and OH groups
on the surface of TiO2(s).24 The signals of Ca 2P and Cl 2P electrons from the trace amount of
the CaCl2(s) byproduct are presented in Figure S12c,d.25,26

Further investigation of the reaction
carried out for only 20 h
provided a dark blue product also. The XRD pattern in Figure S13 shows that the solid is a mixture
of several products. In addition to TiO2(s) and CaCl2(s), perovskite CaTiO3(s) was also formed at this
stage, probably as an intermediate. As discussed above, it may react
further with TiCl4(g) to grow the TiO2(s) NWs.
As shown by the SEM and EDX data in Figure S14, some as-synthesized CaTiO3(s) crystals with sizes 4–13
μm, much larger than the ones found in the commercial powders
(size 2–4 μm, Figure S4),
are found in the sample. On the other hand, the XRD pattern and the
SEM image in Figure S15 reveal that in
the sample, there also coexisted numerous rutile TiO2(s) NWs about 10 μm in length with partially reacted large CaTiO3(s) crystals. In addition, as shown in Figure S16, CaTiO3(s) crystals with numerous steps
on the faces are found in the sample. After the reaction time extends
to 36 h, the product contained rutile TiO2(s) NWs embedded
in a matrix of CaCl2(s) only, as demonstrated by the data
discussed previously in Figure S9. No CaTiO3(s) was observed anymore.

In summary, from the reactions
between TiCl4(g) and
CaO(s), we discover that large CaTiO3(s) (ca.
4–13 μm) crystals were generated as the intermediate
and reacted further to produce long NWs, such as the ones observed
in C973. In contrast, from the small size commercial CaTiO3(s) (size 2–4 μm), the NRs in P973 were relatively short,
about 4 μm in length. From these observations, we conclude that
the particle sizes of the perovskite CaTiO3(s) influence
the lengths of the rutile 1D structure greatly. A reaction pathway
will be proposed and discussed further below.

The effect of
the reaction temperature (923–1023 K) on the
NW growths, as shown by the XRD and the SEM images, is presented in Figures S17 and S18, respectively. Based on the
XRD patterns displayed in Figure S17, all
products, C923 (grown at 923 K), C973, and C1023 (grown at 1023 K),
are determined to be rutile-phase TiO2(s). The SEM images
of C923 (Figure S18a,b) display uneven
NRs with lengths 100–300 nm and widths 80–140 nm. As
discussed above, C973 shows numerous long NWs with widths 80–140
nm and lengths 10–15 μm in Figure 3 and in Figure S18c,d. For C1023 observed in Figure S18e,f,
long rods are found. With widths 300–400 nm and lengths exceeding
10 μm, they appear to be aggregates of NWs.

2.3 O-Deficiency in TiO2(s) NRs and
NWs
The XPS data and the color of the as-prepared TiO2(s) products suggest that they are O-deficient.27 From the results of the thermogravimetric analyses
(TGA) presented in Figure 4a, P973 and C973 heated in a stream of O2(g) turned
white and showed 3.8 and 7.5 wt % increases, respectively. Consequently,
the original P973 and C973 compositions are determined to be TiO1.81 and TiO1.65, respectively. As suggested by
the TGA studies, bulk samples of P973 and C973 were heated at 773
K in air to offer the corresponding oxidized samples PA973 and CA973.
As shown in the Raman spectra in Figure 4b, the vibrations of P973, C973, PA973, and
CA973 are assigned to the second-order scattering Eg (232
cm–1), Eg (447 cm–1), and A1g (612 cm–1) modes of rutile
TiO2(s).28 For P973 and C973
with O-deficiencies, the Eg signals are found at 437 and
439 cm–1 while the A1g signals are observed
at 632 and 629 cm–1, respectively.29 For PA973 and CA973, the Eg and the A1g modes are observed at 446 and 636 cm–1, respectively.
They agree well with the characteristic rutile TiO2(s) peaks.
Clearly, the blue shifts of the Eg and A1g vibrations
of P973 and C973 from the reported rutile values are proposed to be
originated from the O-deficiencies. The electron paramagnetic resonance
(EPR) results of the samples are shown in Figure 4c. For P973 and C973, the observed g factors
1.96 and 1.94 are attributed to the Ti3+ in the O-deficient
sites in the bulk and in the subsurface layers of rutile crystals,
respectively.30 C973, with more O-deficiencies,
shows stronger EPR signals than P973 does. As displayed in Figure 4c, CA973 and PA973
are nearly EPR-silent after being annealed in air to remove the O
vacancies. Figure S19 shows the UV–vis
diffuse reflectance spectra and the plots of the spectra transformed
according to the Kubelka–Munk function.31,32 In Figure S19a, P973 and C973 display
absorptions at 438 and 450 nm, respectively. Because of their O-deficiencies,
the absorptions show significant red-shifts from that of rutile TiO2(s), reported at 410 nm. On the other hand, the oxidized products
PA973 and CA973 demonstrate the literature value at 410 nm. From Figure S19b, the optical band gaps of the samples
are derived from the plots of (F(R∞)hν)2 versus hν. After the analyses, the band gap energies are calculated
to be 2.88, 2.79, 2.96, and 2.95 eV for P973, C973, PA973, and CA973,
respectively. The observations agree with the literature report, indicating
that TiO2(s) samples with more O-deficiencies show lower
band gaps and darker blue colors.32

2.4 Proposed Reaction Pathway
Although
1D crystalline rutile TiO2 nanostructures were prepared
previously via solution routes, including hydrothermal and electrochemical
methods followed by high-temperature treatments, our experiments demonstrate
the first successful solvent-free growth of the material with extremely
high aspect ratio.9,10,20,24 Thermodynamically, reacting CaTiO3(s) with TiCl4(g) favors the formation of TiO2(s) as shown by its exothermic nature in eq 1(33) 1  

In addition, CaTiO3(s) and
TiO2(s) are also produced exothermically from CaO(s) and TiCl4(g), as expressed in eqs 2 and 3 2   3  

By summarizing the
experimental observations discussed above, a
schematic illustration of the VSRG process of 1D TiO2(s) is depicted in Scheme 1. During the reaction, phase separation of the solid products grown
at the interface between the vapor and the solid reactants shapes
the product morphology.34−37 In this study, TiCl4(g) reacts with CaTiO(s), both commercially supplied and as-synthesized, to produce
a mixture of TiO2(s) and CaCl2(l) (Figures S1 and S9) on the surface of the solid
reactant. As presented in Scheme 1, we propose that because of the high melting point
of TiO2(s) (1903 K) and its low solubility in the as-produced
CaCl2(l) (mp 1045 K), the oxide NRs and NWs elongate along
the CaTiO3(s) faces. This is supported by the steps observed
on the sides of the reacted CaTiO3(s) displayed in Figures S16.38 As
the reaction prolongs, nanosized TiO2 clusters grow into
the high aspect ratio crystals while each individual one is embedded
in and isolated by the as-formed molten CaCl2(l) media
at 973 K. After the removal of CaCl2(s), the 1D TiO2(s) products are isolated. From the commercial CaTiO3(s), short NRs were obtained because the crystal sizes in the perovskite
reactant were small (Figure S4a). In contrast,
long NWs were isolated from the large synthesized perovskite crystals
(Figure S14). The proposed reaction pathway
agrees with the results observed.

Scheme 1 Proposed 1D TiO2(s) Growth
Process
2.5 Performance
as Li-Ion Battery Electrodes
The 1D solids were examined
by cyclic voltammetric (CV) measurements
using CR2032 type half-cell devices constructed from P973 and C973
and a piece of Li(s) foil as the electrodes. The CV results
presented in Figure S20 show five cycles
of CV profiles (0.5 mV s–1, 1.0–3.0 V vs
Li/Li+). For both samples, obvious cathodic peaks located
at 1.4 V are observed in the first sweep. It is assigned to the conversion
of TiO2(s) into LixTiO2(s) according to the equation TiO2(s) + xLi+ + xe– → LixTiO2(s).39 In the anodic scan, a peak at 1.95 V is observed.
This represents the extraction of Li+ ions from LixTiO2(s).40,41 The shape of the later CV sweeps does not change significantly.
Galvanostatic charge/discharge voltage profiles of P973 and C973 at
1 C (170 mA g–1, 1.0–3.0 V vs Li/Li+. The C rate is defined as the current to discharge the nominal capacity
in 1 h) are displayed in Figure S21. The
irreversible capacity loss between 1.4 and 1.0 V during the first
cycle is related to the irreversible change of the rutile structure
during deep Li+-ion insertions.42 As suggested by the literature, a short plateau appeared at approximately
1.45 V in the discharging curve, which is attributed to the result
of the insertion of Li+ ions into the octahedral positions
in the lattice.43 The desertion of Li+ ions is observed at ca. 1.95 V as a plateau in the charging
curve. This conclusion coincides with the result of CV measurement
discussed above. Figure 5 shows the specific discharge capacities of several half-cell devices
constructed from the TiO2(s) samples at a current rate
1 C (1.0–3.0 V vs Li/Li+). The corresponding initial
charge/discharge data of the samples are displayed in Figure S22 in
the Supporting Information. Among them,
P973 demonstrates the best performance. It exhibits the first-cycle
discharge capacity 166.4 mA h g–1 with an initial
Coulombic efficiency (capacity discharged/capacity charged x 100%) of 84.3%. As shown in Figure 5, other samples do not perform as well as
P973 does. The corresponding cycling performance data are summarized
in Table S2. After 100 cycles, P973 provides
a capacity of 143.3 mA h g–1, which is the best
performance among all samples investigated. The capacities of P973
and C973 at different charging rates (1, 2, and 5 C, 1.0–3.0
V) are shown in Figure S23. Again, P973
exhibits better performance at all charging rates than C973 does.
The results of electrochemical impedance spectroscopic (EIS) analyses
of P973 and C973 are summarized in Figure S24 in the Supporting Information. The corresponding Nyquist plots are
drawn in Figure S24a by using the equivalent
circuit shown in S24b. From the impedance
spectra, the internal resistance Rs, the
charge transfer resistance Rct, and the
Warburg impedance Zw are estimated and
listed in Table S3. By using the data,
σ, the diffusion coefficient, and DLi+, the diffusion rate of Li+ ions in the electrode
material, are calculated and provided in Table S3.44 The results indicate that
the Rs and Rct values of P973, 9.39 and 134.21 Ω are higher than those of
C973, 5.75 and 86.20 Ω, respectively. However, the capacity
of P973, 143.3 mA h g–1, exceeds that of C973, 102.3
mA h g–1, greatly. Thus, the low Rs and Rct values of C973 do
not enhance its battery performance. On the other hand, the DLi+ value of P973, 29.52 × 10–15 cm2 s–1, is nearly
four times that of C973, 8.61 × 10–15 cm2 s–1. We attribute that increasing DLi+ in the solid electrode material
enhances the battery capacity. Clearly, DLi+ is the major factor affecting the battery performance.
This agrees with the literature observations.41,45−47 It has been reported that the rate of Li+ ion intercalation into rutile TiO2(s) along c-axis is 10–6 cm2 s–1 while through ab-plane is 10–15 cm2 s–1.12 Therefore, the capacity performance of the battery depends highly
on the amount of the channels along c-axis, which
is the [001] direction in the lattice. Previously, the TEM images
of the NR in P973 (Figure 1e) and the NW in C973 (Figure 3b) display that the crystals have long lengths in the
[001] direction. Consequently, we propose that Li+ ions
could insert and desert through the channels in that direction more
easily. Because the NRs are much shorter than the NWs, the diffusion
of Li+ ions in the NRs should be more effective than in
the NWs, as demonstrated by the corresponding DLi+ values.43 To demonstrate
that shorter crystals would improve the battery performance, we shorten
the length of the NWs in C973 by ultrasonicating the sample in ethanol
for 120 min. The shortened NWs, with lengths 1–4 μm,
is named m-C973 and shown in Figure S25. After being assembled into a half battery, the m-C973 device shows
improved performance as demonstrated in Figure S26. For example, at 2 C, the capacity of the m-C973 device
increases to 108.4 mA h g–1. Moreover, DLi+ of m-C973 derived from the EIS analysis
(Figure S27) increases to 14.12 ×
10–15 cm2 s–1. The
value is about twice of the result of C973.

P923, P973, P1023, C923, C973, C923, PA973,
and CA973 electrodes at 1 C (170 mA g–1, 1.0–3.0
V vs Li/Li+. The C rate is defined as the current to discharge
the nominal capacity in 1 h).

Both P973 and C973 were further tested for variable current rate
charging and discharging studies. In Figure 6, the results of the discharge/charge at
0.5 C followed by increasing those to 1, 2, 5, 10 C, and returning
to 1 C sequentially for 10 cycles each are shown. P973 demonstrates
better performance with average reversible capacities 152.7, 139.3,
124.1, 104.4, and 75.7 mA h g–1 at 0.5, 1, 2, 4,
and 10 C, respectively. After the current rate was reduced back to
1 C, a respectable capacity 133.8 mA h g–1 was observed.
The experiment indicates a stable reversibility of P973. The long-term
cycling performance test result of P973 at 2 C is presented in Figure 7. At the 10th cycle,
the capacity was recorded to be 136.8 mA h g–1.
After 200 cycles, the capacity was retained at 121.3 mA h g–1. After 800 cycles, the capacity was measured to be 99.2 mA h g–1, which is 72.5% of the value recorded at the 10th
cycle. The result indicates that the device possesses an excellent
long-term cycling stability with a capacity loss of only 0.04% per
cycle. The Coulombic efficiency for each cycle is excellent as well,
ranging from 99.3 to 99.8%.

3 Conclusions
In this study, we successfully developed a new synthetic method
to grow O-deficient rutile TiO2(s) NRs and NWs by a VSRG
method. The process employed TiCl4(g) to react with commercially
supplied CaTiO3(s) (size 2–4 μm) at 973 K
under atmospheric pressure to generate TiO2(s) NRs (diameters
80–120 nm, lengths 1–4 μm). In the reaction which
employed TiCl4(g) to react with CaO(s) at 973
K also generated CaTiO3(s) (size 4–13 μm)
as the intermediate. This reacted further with TiCl4(g) to produce NWs (diameters 80–120 nm, lengths 4–15
μm). This is the first report of the 1D rutile TiO2(s) nanostructure with such a high aspect ratio. Both of the NRs and
the NWs, with compositions TiO1.81 and TiO1.65, respectively, were single crystals grown in the [001] direction.
Their morphology was affected by the reaction temperature, the concentration
of TiCl4(g), and especially the particle size of CaTiO3(s). As indicated by the steps observed on the sides of the
reacted CaTiO3(s) crystal surface, we suggest that during
the reaction, the growths of TiO2(s) and CaCl2(l) were assisted by phase separation along the vapor–solid reaction
interface. Consequently, when large size CaTiO3(s) crystals
were reacted, long 1D TiO2(s) NWs were grown from the large
crystal faces.

The NRs and the NWs were investigated as anode
materials for LIBs.
At constant current rates 1, 2, and 5 C for 100 cycles, the cycling
(1.0–3.0 V) performance data of the NRs were 146, 123, and
104 mA h g–1, respectively. On the other hand, the
cycling performance data of the NWs were 120, 80, 52 mA h g–1, respectively. This is because the Li+ ion diffusion
rate (DLi+) of the NRs (29.52
× 10–15 cm2 s–1) is higher than that of the NWs (8.61 × 10–15 cm2 s–1). Although the [001] growth
direction of the NR crystals would provide the fastest channels for
the diffusion of Li+ ions and enhance the battery capacity,
the extremely long channels in the NWs could hamper the diffusion
of the Li+ ions. Another important factor which affects
the performance is the O-deficient structure, which increases the
conductivity and improves the cycling stability of the batteries.48 As a result, the long-term cycling test at 2
C for the battery constructed from the NRs retained 121 mA h g–1 after 200 cycles and 99.2 mA h g–1 after 800 cycles. The device has an excellent long-term cycling
stability with a loss of only 0.04% per cycle. While the performance
of the device is comparable to those of other rutile-phase TiO2(s) examples reported in literature (Table S4), it is interesting to note that the crystal size of the
NRs far exceeds the literature cases.42,43,49−52 This indicates that while the surface area of the
NRs is comparatively small, it provides an efficient electrolyte/electrode
interface. We expect the simple VSRG method can be further improved
so that better TiO2(s) products may be prepared more efficiently
in the future.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Preparation of Rutile TiO2(s) NRs
Before
the reaction, a hot-wall reactor system composed of a quartz
tube (length: 85 cm, diameter: 27 mm) placed inside a Lindberg tubular
furnace was heated at 1273 K and 10–5 Pa overnight.
After the apparatus was loaded with CaTiO3(s) (0.3 g) at
room temperature, it was heated to 923–1023 K. Then, TiCl4(l) (Fluka 98%, 1.84 mL), evaporated with the assistance of
a stream of Ar(g) (flow rate 4–16 sccm) at 1–4
bubbles s–1 under 1 Pa for 20 h, reacted with the
solid. After the reaction completed, the product was washed with DI
water several times to remove the soluble portion and dried at 353
K overnight to offer blue solid products (ca. 0.2 g) P923, P973, and
P1023, formed at 923, 973, and 1023 K, respectively. A summary of
the experimental conditions and the obtained products are listed in
Table S1 in the Supporting Information.
P973 was further heated at 773 K in air for 5 h to remove the O-deficiency.
After the treatment, the white product PA973 was collected.

4.2 Preparation of Rutile TiO2(s) NWs
An analogous
reaction route, reported previously by our group,
was employed.17 In the process, CaO(s) was reacted with TiCl4(g) using the same reaction
setup under similar conditions. The dark blue products, C923, C973,
and C1024, obtained from the reactions carried out at 823, 973, and
1024 K, respectively, were collected (Table S1). C973 was further heated at 773 K in air for 5 h to remove the
O-deficiency. This offered the white product CA973.

4.3 Characterizations
All samples were
verified by using a powder XRD (Bruker AXS D8 ADVANCE) with Cu Kα1
radiation (40 kV, 20 mA). The SEM images and the EDX spectra of the
samples were investigated by using JEOL JSM-7401F operated at 15 keV.
The TEM, SAED, HRTEM, and EDX data were recorded from a JEOL JEM-200
FTM at 200 kV. The XPS results were obtained by a ULVAC-PHI (PHI 5000
Versaprobe). The UV–vis absorption spectra were recorded on
a Hitachi 3010 UV–vis spectrophotometer. A Renishaw Raman spectrometer
using a 632.8 nm laser was used to characterize the vibrational information
of the samples. The EPR spectra were recorded using a JES-FA200 spectrometer.
The TGA studies were performed with a NETZSCH STA 409PC under an O2(g) atmosphere.

4.4 Electrochemical Tests
All electrochemical
tests were examined by using CR2032 coin-type cells assembled in a
dry room. The working electrodes were manufacture by the following
steps. A N-methyl pyrrolidone (Timcal) slurry was
mixed with carbon black (Super-P) (Timcal) and polyvinylidene fluoride
in a weight ratio of 8:1:1. The slurry was then uniformly coated on
a Cu foil (Furukawa, thickness 14 μm) and dried at 383 K in
vacuum overnight. The coated Cu foil was cut into disk electrodes
(diameter 13 mm). The electrolyte was composed of LiPF6(s) in a solution of ethylenecarbonate (1.0 M) and dimethyl carbonate
(1.0 M) in a volume ratio of 1:2. The active material was weighed
(ca. 12 mg) and loaded for each battery. A piece of Li(s) foil (thickness 0.3 mm, diameter 14 mm, ca. 6 mg) was used as the
counter electrode and the reference electrode, whereas a piece of
membrane (Celgard 2400, pore size: 20 μm) was employed as the
separator. A BAT-750B (UbiQ technology) cell test instrument was used
to investigate the galvanostatic discharge/charge behaviors of the
cells (1.0–3.0 V vs Li/Li+).

The CV experiments
were measured with a CHI 6082C electrochemical analyzer (1.0–3.0
V, 0.5 mV/s). The EIS tests (100 kHz to 0.1 Hz, 5 mV) were carried
out using a CHI 6082C electrochemical analyzer.
