Vinyl
monomers from soybean, sunflower, linseed, and olive oils
were copolymerized with styrene (St), methyl methacrylate (MMA), and
vinyl acetate (VAc) to determine the reactivity of biobased monomers
in radical copolymerization, as well as their feasibility in emulsion
processes for the synthesis of biobased latexes. Radical copolymerization
of plant-oil-based monomers is described with the classical Mayo–Lewis
equation. Using emulsion (or miniemulsion) polymerization with MMA
or VAc, stable aqueous polymer dispersions with latex particles measuring
80–160 nm and containing 3–35 wt % of biobased monomer
units were successfully synthesized. The number-average molecular
weight of the latex copolymers (20 000–150 000)
decreases by increasing the degree of unsaturation in monomers and
their content in the reaction feed. The presence of plant-oil-based
fragments changes the Tg of resulting
copolymers from 105 to 79 °C in copolymerization with MMA and
from 30 to 11 °C in copolymerization with Vac. As a result, biobased
units provide considerable flexibility (elongation at break of about
250%) and improve the toughness of the normally rigid and brittle
poly(MMA). Even a small amount (2–5%) of biobased fragments
incorporated into the structure of poly(VAc) significantly improves
water resistance and provides hydrophobicity to the resulting polymer
latex films. The obtained results clearly indicate that the vinyl
monomers from plant oils can be considered as good candidates for
internal plasticization of polymeric materials through reducing intermolecular
interactions in copolymers.

Introduction
The compositions of
most plant oils, including oils from annual
crops, consist of a wide range of triglycerides (esters of glycerol
and three long-chain fatty acids),
varying across different plant species and growth conditions.1 Plant oils represent good renewable sources for
oleochemical industrial products, particularly biobased polymers,
because their structures are similar to those of petroleum-based long-chained
hydrocarbons, with the main difference being that plant oils are much
more unsaturated.1−6 These structural differences provide additional opportunities for
chemical modifications of plant-oil-based macromolecules and the possibility
of developing new types of biobased polymers.

To obtain cross-linked
polymers from plant oils, an oxidative mechanism
is typically used as the polymerization method for triglycerides with
different types of unsaturated fatty acid chains having one or several
double bonds.7−10 Cross-linked macromolecules have also been developed by modification
of triglycerides with vinyl monomers (e.g., styrenation of unsaturated
fatty acid chains) in the presence of radical initiators (benzoyl
peroxide, di-tert-butyl peroxide).11,12 To prepare thermosetting polyesters, polyurethanes, polyamides,
acrylic resins, and epoxy resins from triglyceride oils, various polycondensation
strategies can be used, including polycondensation of diacids, diols,
diisocyanates, and epoxy resins via epoxidation of unsaturated fatty
acid chains of triglyceride oils.13 Coatings
based on water-soluble alkyd resins prepared from maleinized triglyceride
oils have been described by Solomon14 and
reported in several papers.15−17

Free-radical chain copolymerization
is an efficient method for
the synthesis of an almost unlimited number of different macromolecules
by variation in the nature or/and amount of two or more monomers,
as well as for tailoring the resulting macromolecules with specifically
desired properties.18 In particular, copolymerization
of the second monomer into the polymer structure can plasticize the
resulting material by lowering the intermolecular interactions between
the chains, thus softening the polymers and decreasing the glass-transition
temperature, or the modulus (internal plasticization).19,20 Long nonpolar fragments of bulky comonomers (C16–C18) included into the macromolecules can be considered good
candidates for internal plasticization of polymeric materials. It
should be noted that the latter approach is more efficient than external
plasticization (a method that provides plasticity through physical
mixing of polymers with compounds of low vapor pressure) or mixtures
of two or more polymers.21

Recently,
we reported on the synthesis and free-radical polymerization
behavior of a vinyl monomer from soybean oil triglycerides,22 as well as homopolymerization of new monomers
based on sunflower, linseed, and olive oils23 (Scheme 1). Conventional
radical chain polymerization of these monomers yields linear macromolecules,
whereas the double bonds of the fatty acid chains remain unaffected
and thus capable of postpolymerization oxidative reactions to modify
the polymer, if needed.

Scheme 1 Chemical Structure of Plant-Oil-Based Monomers
and Typical Chemical
Compositions of Plant Oils Used in This Study for Monomer Synthesis
In radical copolymerization,
newly developed monomers with long,
nonpolar C18 fragments of differing unsaturation can act
as a specialty monomer (polymer modifier), even at their low content
(2–5 wt %), to provide unique properties and performance (flexibility,
toughness, water resistance, adhesion, etc.) of resulting polymeric
materials in various industrial applications. Particularly, water
resistance of coatings and their mechanical properties can be improved
by internal plasticization provided by copolymerizing the plant-oil-based
monomers.

Emulsion polymerization is a predominant process widely
employed
in industry for commercial radical copolymerization and for producing
waterborne polymeric materials (latexes in particular). Because of
the highly hydrophobic nature of triglyceride molecules, using plant
oils in this process has been challenging. In the synthesis of most
available copolymers from plant oils for making industrial coatings,
radical copolymerization, including the emulsion copolymerization
technique, is not currently employed due to the absence of the respective
monomers.24−30 Recently, Tang et al. developed a new strategy for synthesizing
fatty monomers from high oleic soybean oil (HOSO) and demonstrated
their ability to yield thermoplastic polymers in free-radical polymerization.31 As a result, macromolecules with a wide range
of glass-transition temperatures and properties were synthesized from
a library of HOSO-based (meth)acrylate monomers.32 Polymers exhibiting Tg in a
range of more than 100 °C difference and demonstrating physical
properties of materials with viscoelastic and thermoplastic behaviors
were obtained. Vilela et al. employed transition-metal-catalyzed transvinylation
to obtain vinyl monomers from oleic and linoleic acids and vinyl acetate
(VAc).33 Variation of resulting fatty acid
vinyl ester monomers yielded copolymers with VAc in a range of Mn = 1000–3000 and glass-transition temperatures
between −5 and 16 °C.

Inspired by the feasibility
of recently synthesized new vinyl monomers
from sunflower (SFM), linseed (LSM), soybean (SBM), and olive (OVM)
oils in chain radical polymerization, we report about their copolymerization
behavior in reactions with conventional vinyl comonomers. The ability
to control the content of plant-oil-based monomer units in the resulting
macromolecules using the classical Mayo–Lewis equation was
investigated. Another objective of this study was to synthesize latexes
from new monomers and evaluate how the fraction of the plant-oil-based
monomer units in the resulting macromolecules affects the latex properties,
glass-transition temperature (Tg), and
mechanical performance of films and coatings made from the obtained
biobased latexes, as well as polymer latex film hydrophobicity.

Results
and Discussion
Radical Copolymerization of Plant-Oil-Based
Monomers
Two reactive sites are present in a plant-oil-based
monomer’s
structure: a vinyl double bond, CH2=CH–C(O),
which determines chain propagation, and isolated double bonds in fatty
fragments, CH2–CH=CH–CH2, containing allylic hydrogen atoms prone to degradative chain transfer
by formation of less active −CH=CH–CH•– radicals.23 Recently, we reported on the synthesis and free-radical
copolymerization behavior of a vinyl monomer from soybean oil triglycerides
with methyl methacrylate (MMA).22 Nevertheless,
growing PMMA radicals are known to undergo chain transfer reactions
to a lesser extent.23 At the same time,
homopolymerization of new monomers based on sunflower, linseed, and
olive oils revealed that (1) the number-average molecular weight of
plant-oil-based homopolymers decreases in the range of
poly(OVM) > poly(SFM) > poly(SBM) > poly(LSM), corresponding
to increasing
degree of unsaturation in the monomers; (2) the obtained values of
the chain transfer constant on monomer CM clearly depend on the monomer structure as follows: CM(LSM) > CM(SBM) > CM(SFM) > CM(OVM).
Such a behavior is explained by the presence of differing numbers
of allylic hydrogen atoms in the monomer molecules and the corresponding
reaction of chain termination through degradative chain transfer on
monomers (allylic termination).27

Taking into account that VAc is widely used for the development of
industrial aqueous polymer dispersions (latexes), radical copolymerization
of LSM, SBM, SFM, and OVM with VAc was explored in this study to evaluate
plant-oil-based monomers’ feasibility in the use of copolymerization
and ability to vary the biobased content in the resulting macromolecules.
Unlike PMMA radicals, growing PVAc radicals show higher reactivity
in chain transfer reactions. Hence, one of the experimental goals
was to determine whether the chain transfer reactions observed during
the homopolymerization of plant-oil-based monomers27 impact the radical copolymerization behavior of LSM, SBM,
OVM, and/or SFM.

First, the Q–e parameters,
which provide
a semiquantitative prediction of monomer reactivity ratios of monomers,
allowing for description of the behavior of monomers in radical copolymerization,
were targeted. For this purpose, in copolymerization of the SBM, LSM,
SFM, and OVM with styrene (St), monomer reactivity ratios r1 and r2 were experimentally
determined for each monomer pair by measuring an instantaneous copolymer
composition (at low monomer conversions of 5–10%, using 1H NMR spectroscopy) (Figure S1 in
Supporting Information) and employing the Fineman–Ross method
to a solution of the Mayo–Lewis copolymerization equation (Figure 1).18,33 Employing a Fineman–Ross equation34 yields a straight line plot with slope r1 and intercept r2.

Figure 1 Experimental content
of the plant-oil-based monomer in the copolymers
with St vs content of the plant-oil-based monomer in the initial feed
mixture.

For each monomer pair, the experimental
data of the feed composition Fi = [M1]i/[M2]i and
copolymer composition fi = [m1]i/[m2]i were calculated,
where [M1] and [M2] are each monomer’s
concentration in a feed and [m1] and [m2] are each monomer’s content in a copolymer. 1  Experimental data
on r1 and r2 for monomer pairs are
shown in Table 1. It
could be concluded that all of the growing plant-oil-based monomer
radicals are mainly added to the St monomer (r1 < 1). Given the experimental r1 and r2 values for each monomer pair,
as well as literature data on St Q–e parameters
(Q = 1 and e = −0.8),35 the Alfrey–Price scheme
(eq 1) was applied to
calculate the Q–e of the SBM, LSM, SFM, and
OVM (Table 2).

The obtained results show that both Q and e values are similar for all four plant-oil-based monomers.
Because in an empirical Q–e scheme, the Q value describes the effects of the resonance factor and
(to a smaller extent) the steric factor, it appears that both these
factors affect plant-oil-based monomer reactivity in copolymerization
in a similar way. In the Q–e approach, the e value describes the polar factor by defining the role
of monomer polarity in copolymerization. The data indicate that among
the four monomers, the less unsaturated, thus, less polar, olive oil-based
monomer possesses the smallest e value. Otherwise,
polar effects do not seem to have a significant impact on plant-oil-based
monomer reactivity in copolymerization. In general, differences between
the Q–e values of the biobased vinyl monomers
are small, as might be expected, assuming similarities in the structure
of the monomer molecules.

To further demonstrate that experimentally
determined Q–e parameters can be applied to
control the composition of copolymers
from plant-oil-based monomers, a series of studies on radical copolymerization
of LSM, OVM, SFM, and SBM with VAc were carried out.

The chemical
composition of each resulting copolymer (10 for each
monomer pair) was determined using 1H NMR spectroscopy
and compared with the theoretical copolymer compositions. The theoretical
compositions were assessed using the Alfrey–Price scheme (eq 1) and Q–e values for VAc (Q = 0.026, e =
−0.88),35 as well as for plant-oil-based
monomers, as shown in Table 3, to determine r1 and r2 for each monomer pair. In the next step, these r1 and r2 were applied
to calculate each theoretical copolymer composition using the Mayo–Lewis
copolymerization equation (eq 2). 2  It can be seen (Figure 2) that the experimental
and calculated plots
are in good agreement, indicating that radical copolymerization of
both LSM (Figure 2A)
and SBM (Figure 2B)
with VAc is described by the Mayo–Lewis copolymerization equation.
The determined Q–e values can be employed
in estimating plant-oil-based monomer reactivity in copolymerization
with other monomers to control biobased content in the resulting copolymers.
In terms of polymerizability in radical copolymerization, the plant-oil-based
monomers LSM, OVM, SFM, and SBM can be classified as vinyl monomers.

Synthesis and Properties of Biobased Latexes
Latexes
based on VAc and acrylic monomers are widely applied as adhesives
and binders in various coatings, as well as in the impregnation of
different materials (paper, nonwoven, etc.). Incorporation of small
amounts of hydrophobic monomers (e.g., 2-ethylhexyl acrylate) into
latex polymers is known to improve their properties and performance
(flexibility, toughness, water resistance, and adhesion).36 VAc and acrylic monomers (particularly, MMA)
are known to be moderately soluble in water (2.5 and 1.6 g/100 mL,
respectively),37 whereas plant-oil-based
monomers are hydrophobic and almost insoluble in water.23 The synthesis of latex polymers from highly
hydrophobic monomers has been conducted through conventional emulsion
polymerization under certain conditions (e.g., higher surfactant concentration).38

The miniemulsion (when reaction starts
in the monomer droplet) polymerization technique was developed and
studied by Ugelstad and Schork.39−41 Hydrophilic monomers have been
shown to be successfully copolymerized with hydrophobic octadecyl
methacrylate using miniemulsion polymerization.39,40 Even fluorinated monomers can be easily polymerized and copolymerized
using miniemulsions.41 Special approaches
have been used, such as higher shear rate, adding osmotic agents,
and using initiators soluble in oleophase (AIBN).41 Miniemulsion polymerization occurs in nanosized droplets,
which can be considered as nanoreactors. The large interfacial area
between the aqueous and oil phases facilitates radical reactions at
the interface and increases copolymerization feasibility for monomers
with a very different aqueous solubility.

In this study, latexes
from LSM, SBM, OVM, SFM, and MMA or VAc
were synthesized using emulsion and miniemulsion polymerization. Two
oil phases, from the plant-oil-based monomer (Oil Phase 1) and from the comonomer (MMA or VAc) and radical initiator (AIBN)
(Oil Phase 2), were applied in the miniemulsion process.
Each oil phase was miniemulsified in a surfactant-containing aqueous
phase to obtain two separate miniemulsions. Polymerization started
by slowly adding a miniemulsion, containing a plant-oil-based monomer,
into a comonomer-containing one at 60 °C under stirring. The
characteristics of the resulting stable biobased latexes are shown
in Tables 4 and 5.

Miniemulsion copolymerization of
plant-oil-based monomers and MMA
was completed within 3 h, during which essentially all monomers were
polymerized; the conversion of monomers was about 87–99% (Table 4). The resulting latexes
with an average particle size of 80–160 nm and biobased content
of 5–35 wt % exhibit high stability at room temperature within
several months. The molecular weight of the resulting copolymers decreases
as follows: poly(MMA-co-OVM) > poly(MMA-co-SBM) > poly(MMA-co-SFM) > poly(MMA-co-LSM), corresponding to increasing degree of unsaturation
in the
monomers. A similar effect was observed by increasing the fraction
of the plant-oil-monomer in the initial mixture.

Decreasing
molecular weight can be explained by the effect of degradative
chain transfer on the monomer (allylic termination) provided by differing
numbers of allylic hydrogen atoms in the monomer molecules.23 Analysis of Tg data
measured by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) shows that the
presence of biobased fragments in the resulting copolymers decreases
the glass-transition temperature in comparison to that of poly(MMA)
(Tg = 105 °C).
The obtained data indicate that variation of biobased content in macromolecules
changes the thermal properties of the resulting copolymers from MMA
and plant-oil-based monomers to a large extent.

After 6 h of
miniemulsion copolymerization of plant-oil-based monomers
and VAc, the total monomer conversion was about 70%. This can be explained
by allylic termination, as well as high reactivity of the VAc radical.18 The increasing unsaturation of plant-oil-based
monomers leads to an increase in the number of allylic hydrogen atoms
and effective chain transfer reactions and lowers the molecular weight
of the resulting polymers. This is confirmed by the fact that the
highest molecular weight was detected for VAc copolymers with the
least unsaturated OVM.

Using the emulsion technique when the
plant-oil-based monomer is
fed into the reaction mixture after VAc is partially converted, both
conversion and latex solid content can be increased (Table 5). DSC data show that the impact
of oil-based fragments (3–13 wt %) on the Tg of copolymers with Vac is more significant than that
of copolymers with MMA. For both copolymers from MMA and VAc, biobased
fragments make the resulting macromolecules more flexible, as indicated
by a decreasing glass-transition temperature. Softening the polymer
usually increases the elongation of break at room temperature and
toughness and lowers Young’s modulus. These effects are targeted
by plasticization of coating or film to facilitate easier processing.

To provide more insights into the plasticizing effect of plant-oil-based
fragments, tensile properties of the resulting latex copolymer films
with MMA were evaluated at room temperature as a function of the biobased
content. The results were obtained for the MMA copolymers with SBM
and with less unsaturated OVM (Table 6). Although poly(MMA) does not form a film at 18–25
°C, 40–45 μm latex films were successfully created
for testing from copolymers with various biobased contents.

a G′(ω)
is the storage modulus, E is Young’s modulus,
σ is the tensile strength at break, and εb is
the elongation at break.

Table 6 shows that
although Young’s modulus and tensile strength decrease by increasing
the biobased content in the copolymers with MMA, elongation at break
increases significantly for both comonomer pairs. The obtained data
indicate that although poly(MMA) is a rigid and brittle material with
limited ability for elongation, the presence of the biobased fragments
makes the latex films much softer and increases material toughness.
The latter behavior is much more pronounced for MMA copolymerized
with the less unsaturated OVM than for MMA copolymerized with SBM.
The results clearly indicate that the vinyl monomers from plant oils
can be considered as good candidates for internal plasticization of
polymeric materials through chain copolymerization into the macromolecular
structure and reducing intermolecular interactions in copolymers.

In addition to improving mechanical properties, plant-oil-based
fragments can provide water resistance and hydrophobicity to latex
films (coatings). In particular, poly(VAc) aqueous emulsions often
need to be modified because of inherently poor properties with respect
to water resistance. Water molecules act as plasticizers in such latex
films and worsen their mechanical properties; thus, hydrophobic additives
are often needed to reduce water sensitivity of the polymer.

Table 7 displays
the data on the surface energy and water resistance of the latex films
from VAc copolymerized with a relatively small amount of plant-oil-based
monomers in a reactive mixture. Both water resistance and hydrophobicity
of the films increase dramatically in the presence of biobased fragments
in the resulting structure of macromolecules. Table S1 shows a similar change in the surface energy of latex
films based on MMA copolymerized with plant-oil-based monomers.

Transmission electron microscopy
(TEM) analysis of the synthesized
latexes indicates that predominantly spherical particles from plant-oil-based
monomers and MMA or VAc are formed, possessing unimodal size distributions
(Figure S2). In general, TEM results are
in agreement with the DLS data recorded for copolymers with various
biobased contents (Tables 4 and 5).

Conclusions
Vinyl
monomers from soybean, sunflower, linseed, and olive oils
were copolymerized with St, MMA, and VAc to determine the reactivity
of biobased monomers in radical copolymerization, as well as their
feasibility in emulsion processes for the synthesis of biobased latexes.
Radical copolymerization of plant-oil-based monomers is described
with the classical Mayo–Lewis equation. Both Q (0.41–0.51) and e (0.09–0.28) values
do not essentially depend on the structure of the biobased monomers.

Emulsion (or miniemulsion) polymerization of plant-oil-based monomers
with MMA or VAc yields stable aqueous polymer dispersions with latex
particle sizes of 80–160 nm, biobased monomer units containing
latex polymer macromolecules of 3–35 wt %, and a number-average
molecular weight of the resulting copolymers of 20 000–150 000.
The molecular weight of the synthesized macromolecules decreases by
increasing the degree of unsaturation in the biobased monomers and
monomer content in the reaction feed.

Thermal analysis shows
that the presence of oil-based fragments
in the copolymers decreases glass-transition temperature of both copolymers
with MMA and VAc. The tensile properties of latex films indicate that
the presence of the biobased fragments increases PMMA toughness (elongation
at breakup to about 250%). Small amount of plant-oil-based fragments
copolymerized with VAc significantly increases the water resistance
and hydrophobicity of the resulting latex films. The results clearly
show the potential of vinyl monomers from plant oils as candidates
for internal plasticization of polymeric materials through radical
copolymerization into a macromolecular structure and reducing intermolecular
interactions in copolymers.

oil (Crisco; The J.M. Smucker Company,
Orville, OH), sunflower oil (Kirlangic; Turkey), olive oil (Bertolli;
Houston, TX), linseed oil (Sunnyside Corp., Wheeling, IL), and N-(hydroxyethyl)acrylamide (HEAAm; TCI America) were used
as received. 2,2′-Azobis(2-methyl-propionitrile) (AIBN; Sigma-Aldrich,
St. Louis, MO) was purified with recrystallization from methanol.
St (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), MMA (TCI America), and VAc (TCI
America) monomers were distilled under a vacuum to remove the inhibitor
and stored in a refrigerator. Toluene (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO)
was distilled before use. Other solvents and chemicals, analytical
grade or better, were used as received. Deionized water was used for
purification purposes (Milli Q, 18 MΩ).

Plant-Oil-Based Acrylic
Monomer Synthesis and Characterization
Plant-oil-based acrylic
monomers were synthesized from soybean,
linseed, sunflower, olive oils, and N-(hydroxyethyl)acrylamide
using previously reported methods.22,23 The resulting
monomers contain one acrylic double bond linked to one fatty chain,
which varied between fully saturated, mono-, and polyunsaturated,
depending on plant-oil composition (Scheme 2). To confirm the chemical structure of the
synthesized monomers, 1H NMR spectra were recorded on an
AVANCE III HDTM 400 high-performance digital NMR spectrometer (Bruker,
Billerica, MA) using CDCl3 as a solvent (Figure S3). The electrospray ionization high-resolution mass
spectrum of the monomers was obtained using a Bruker Daltonics BioTOF
mass spectrometer (Figure S4).

Monomer Structure of (Acryloylamino)ethyl Linoleate
Free-Radical Copolymerization of Plant-Oil-Based
Monomers with
St/VAc
Each plant-oil-based monomer (0.4–2 g; 0.1–0.9
mole part), vinyl monomer (0.1–0.5 g; St or VAc; 0.9–0.1
mole part, total monomer concentration 1–2 M), and AIBN (0.04
g 0.038 M) were dissolved in 5 mL of toluene, and the mixture was
stirred. The reaction mixture was purged with argon at room temperature
for 30 min. Copolymerization was carried out under an argon blanket
at 60 °C for 2 h until a total monomer conversion of 10–15%
was reached. Samples (0.6–0.7 g) of the reaction mixture were
taken to monitor the progress of the copolymerization reaction using
a gravimetric method after precipitation of the copolymer using a
large excess of methanol or a methanol/water mixture. The resulting
copolymers were purified by multiple precipitations from toluene in
methanol or in a methanol/water mixture. The purified polymer was
dried under a nitrogen blanket at room temperature until it reached
a constant weight. The resulting copolymers containing various amounts
of plant-oil-based fragments are highly soluble in dichloromethane,
chloroform, ethyl acetate, heptane, toluene, dioxane, and tetrahydrofuran
(THF) and less soluble in acetone, dimethylformamide, methanol, and
water.

Plant-Oil-Based Copolymer Characterization
To determine
the composition of copolymers from each plant-oil-based monomer and
St or VAc, 1H NMR spectra were recorded as described above.
The average molecular weight of the copolymers was determined by gel
permeation chromatography (GPC) using a Waters Corporation modular
chromatograph consisting of a Waters 515 HPLC pump, a Waters 2410
Refractive Index Detector, and a set of two 10 μm PL-gel mixed-B
columns; the column temperature was set at 40 °C. THF was used
as the carrier solvent.

Synthesis of Plant-Oil-Based Latexes in Miniemulsion
To synthesize latexes from each plant-oil-based monomer and MMA
or
VAc in miniemulsion, two oil phases were prepared. Two separate miniemulsions
of MMA (or Vac) and plant-oil-based monomers were used instead of
emulsifying the monomer mixture to minimize possible chain transfer
reactions on the biobased monomer during copolymerization23 to increase total monomer conversion and, thus,
copolymer molecular weight. For Oil Phase 1, a different
amount of each plant-oil-based monomer (0.75–6 g) was dissolved
in 1-octanol (weight ratio 2:1). Oil Phase 2 was
prepared by mixing a different amount of VAc (or MMA) (9–14
g), 1.5 wt % of hexadecane (0.13–0.21 g) (based on VAc/MMA
weight) to prevent Ostwald ripening, and 1.5 wt % of initiator AIBN
(0.2–0.3 g) (based on monomer weight). For the aqueous phase,
5 wt % sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS, 0.75 g) (emulsifier) was dissolved
in water.

For pre-emulsification, Oil Phase 1 and Oil Phase 2 were added dropwise to the aqueous
phase divided into two parts and homogenized using a magnetic stirrer
for 45 min at 1200 rpm.

Two miniemulsions were prepared by ultrasonicating
the pre-emulsified
mixtures for 180 s at 90% amplitude (digital sonicator 500 Watt, 1/2″
tip, 20 kHz; QSonica, Newtown, CN) at room temperature. VAc- (or MMA)-containing
miniemulsion was purged with nitrogen and heated to 60 °C at
350 rpm. The miniemulsion containing plant-oil monomer was slowly
added to the other miniemulsion and polymerized for 20 h under stirring.

The plant-oil-monomer content varied between 10 and 40 wt % in
copolymerization with MMA and between 5 and 10 wt % in copolymerization
with VAc. By varying the weight ratio between the oil and aqueous
phase (25:75, 30:70, and 40:60), a series of biobased latexes with
varying biobased contents were successfully prepared.

As an
example, for the synthesis of latex from a soybean-oil-based
monomer and MMA (40:60 wt % ratio, solid content 30%), two oil phases
were prepared. For Oil Phase 1, 6 g (0.016 mol) of
soybean-oil-based monomer was dissolved in 3 g of 1-octanol (weight
ratio 2:1). Oil Phase 2 was prepared by mixing 9
g (0.09 mol) of MMA, 0.13 g of hexadecane (1.5 wt % based on MMA weight)
to prevent Ostwald ripening, and 1.5 wt % of initiator AIBN (0.225
g, 0.035 M) (based on monomer weight). For the aqueous phase, 5 wt
% SDS (0.75 g) (emulsifier) was dissolved in 35 mL of water.

Synthesis
of Plant-Oil-Based Latexes Using Emulsion Polymerization
with VAc
A 250 mL reactor equipped with a mechanical stirrer,
reflux condenser, nitrogen purge, and feed tubes was filled with 83
g of deionized water, 4.83 g of a 65% aqueous solution of the commercial
nonionic surfactant Triton 405 (highly ethoxylated fatty alcohol),
3.25 g of a 20 wt % aqueous solution of SDS, 1.66 g of a 30 wt % aqueous
solution of sodium vinyl sulfonate, and 0.19 g of sodium acetate.
The aqueous phase was heated up to 65 °C while slowly adding
5 g of VAc. When the temperature reached 65 °C, 1.58 g of a 6.2
wt % aqueous solution of ammonium persulfate (initiator) was added
and the temperature was raised to 70 °C. At this point, either
15, 45, or 75 g of VAc and 4.58 g of a 3.3 wt % ammonium persulfate
aqueous solution were added to the reaction mixture over 240 min,
and the temperature was raised to 75 °C. When VAc conversion
reached 15, 50, or 75%, a mixture comprising 5 g of plant-oil-based
monomer and 75, 45, or 15 g of VAc, respectively, was added. Subsequently,
1 g of a 9% ammonium persulfate aqueous solution was added, and the
temperature was raised to 80 °C and maintained for 60 min.

Characterization of Plant-Oil-Based Latexes
The solid
content of the synthesized plant-oil-based latexes was determined
gravimetrically after drying the samples at 110 °C. The size
distribution of latex particles was measured using a Zetasizer Nano-ZS90
(Malvern, Worcestershire, U.K.) at a single scattering angle of 90°
and a temperature of 25 °C (for measurement, 50 μL drop
of each latex was placed in 5 mL of water). For each latex sample,
copolymer composition and average molecular weight were determined
using 1H NMR spectroscopy and GPC, as described above.

The morphology of latex particles was observed on a tungsten filament
100 kV transmission electron microscope (TEM) JEOL JEM-100CX II, (JEOL,
Peabody, MA). For the TEM measurements, a drop of latex dispersion
diluted with deionized water was placed onto a copper mesh covered
with a thin carbon film. The samples were characterized after drying.

The glass-transition temperature of the resulting latexes was determined
via modulated DSC using a TA Instruments Q1000 calorimeter. Dry nitrogen
was purged through the sample at a flow rate of 50 mL/min. The samples
were subjected to an underlying heating rate of 5–10 °C/min.

Latex films were prepared using a draw down bar of 6 mm in thickness,
which was cleaned by acetone before application of steel substrate
QD36 and after drying the films at 105 °C for 2 h. The dynamic
mechanical behavior of the latex films was determined using a dynamic
mechanical analyzer (TA Instruments Q800) with tensile mode and a
heating rate of 5 °C/min. Samples of films with a typical size
of 13 mm × 5 mm (length × width) were used.

The mechanical
properties of the latex films were determined using
an Instron testing machine 2710-004 with a crosshead speed of 5 mm/min,
a maximal load of 500 N, and a temperature range of 0–100 °C.
Rectangle samples with a size of about 25 mm × 5 mm (length ×
width) were used. At least five replicates of each latex sample were
used to obtain an average value.

To determine the surface energy
of latex films with varying biobased
contents, water and diiodomethane contact angle measurements were
carried out using a contact angle/surface tension analyzer (FTA 125)
and the static sessile drop (50 μL) method. An average value
of at least five measurements on each film was taken. Surface energy,
λS, and its components, λSd, λSh, were estimated using Owens and
Wendt expression for modified Young’s equation.42

For selected latex films from copolymers
of VAc and plant-oil-based
monomers, water resistance (using ASTM D5402-15) was determined.
