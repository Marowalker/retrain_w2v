The addition of lead to diphenyl
diselenide in ethylenediamine
(en) or pyridine (py) allowed for the observation of the solvento
complexes, (en)Pb(SePh)2 or (py)2Pb(SePh)2, respectively. Performing this reaction in dimethyl sulfoxide
and subsequent crystallization was found to afford Pb(SePh)2. Inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy revealed
a 1:2 lead to selenium ratio for all three complexes. Nuclear magnetic
resonance spectroscopy confirms that Pb(SePh)2 is readily
solubilized by ethylenediamine, and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry
supports the presence of Pb(SePh)2 moieties in solution.
Single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis of the pyridine adduct,
(py)2Pb(SePh)2, revealed a seesaw molecular
geometry featuring equatorial phenylselenolate ligands. Crystals of
Pb(SePh)2 grown from dimethyl sulfoxide revealed one-dimensional
polymeric chains of Pb(SePh)2. We believe that the lead(II)
phenylselenolate complexes form via an oxidative addition reaction.

Introduction
Metal phenylchalcogenolates
possess rich structural chemistry.
Copper(I) phenylselenolate,1 mercury(II)
phenylselenolate,2 tin(II) phenylchalcogenolates,3 and lead(II) phenylthiolate4,5 are
known to form one-dimensional (1-D) molecular chains in the solid
state, whereas cadmium(II) phenylthiolate and cadmium(II) phenylselenolate
are known to form 3D polyadamantanoid cages.6,7 Copper,
mercury, and cadmium phenylchalcogenolates are utilized as starting
materials in the synthesis of various cluster compounds.8−14

Copper(I) phenylselenolate and tin(IV) phenylselenolate have
been
utilized as single-source precursors for Cu2Se nanocrystals1 and SnSe nanoparticles,15 respectively. Moreover, copper(I) phenylthiolate has been considered
as an active material for organic electronics,16 and tin(IV) phenylthiolate has been studied as a CVD precursor
to obtain SnS and SnS2 thin films.17 Lead phenylselenolate has been explored to a lesser extent, but
in principle could function as a precursor for PbSe, which has applications
in photodetectors,18−20 thermoelectrics,21−26 and photovoltaics.27−29 We recently discovered that reacting diphenyl diselenide
with lead formed a soluble precursor for PbSe.30 This precursor showed promise for thermoelectric applications,
however, its chemical identity was a key unanswered question in that
work.

To elucidate the chemical identity of this PbSe precursor,
we collected
nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopic and electrospray ionization
mass spectrometry data on the precursor solution. In addition to performing
elemental analyses on the solids collected following solvent removal,
single crystals grown separately from pyridine and dimethyl sulfoxide
(DMSO) solution were also analyzed by X-ray diffraction. These characterization
methods collectively indicate that the chemical identity of the previously
described PbSe precursor is solvated lead(II) phenylselenolate.

Results
and Discussion
Our prior work reported the synthesis of a
soluble lead complex
that can function as a precursor for PbSe.30 This precursor was formed by reacting an equimolar amount of diphenyl
diselenide with elemental lead in a variety of solvents. We further
investigated the thermoelectric properties of PbSexTe1–x thin films prepared
by mixing PbSe and PbTe precursors. However, the chemical structure
of the precursor was not identified at that time. To better understand
its composition, we prepared PbSe precursors in ethylenediamine and
pyridine and found that these yielded (en)Pb(SePh)2 (1) and (py)2Pb(SePh)2 (2), respectively. Preparation of the PbSe precursor in DMSO and subsequent
crystallization led to the formation of Pb(SePh)2 (3).

Elemental Analysis of Precursors
We first analyzed
the composition of the precursor prepared in an ethylenediamine solution
with a 1:1 molar ratio of lead to diphenyl diselenide in accordance
with our earlier work.30 We then dried
this reaction mixture in our glovebox to obtain a powder of 1 in 89.6% yield (accounting for incorporation of ethylenediamine
from the solvent). Combustion analysis revealed that the carbon wt
% is slightly higher, whereas the hydrogen wt % and nitrogen wt %
are lower than the expected values for 1 with the atomic
composition (C2H8N2)Pb(SeC6H5)2 (refer to 1a in Table 1). Inductively coupled
plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) on the same powder
detected a selenium to lead ratio of 2.08:1 (Table 2). Suspecting that these observations were
due to the presence of unreacted diphenyl diselenide in solution,
we also performed elemental analysis on 1 synthesized
using a 2:1 molar ratio of lead to diphenyl diselenide. The carbon,
hydrogen, and nitrogen weights match those expected for 1 (refer to 1b in Table 1). Moreover, ICP-OES on the same powder detected
a selenium to lead ratio of 2.05:1, which is closer to the expected
value of 2:1 (Table 2).

Repeating these experiments with single crystals of (2) and (3) revealed combustion data close to the expected
values for the atomic composition of (C5H5N)2Pb(SeC6H5)2 and Pb(SeC6H5)2, respectively (Table 1). We note that the crystals
of 2, obtained from pyridine, changed color from pale
yellow to dark orange and lost mass with time. We attribute this color
change and mass loss to the loss of pyridine from the crystal structure.
This loss of pyridine was also observed upon collecting 1H NMR data for aged 2 dissolved in DMSO-d6. This data shows evidence of free pyridine that has
been displaced from aged 2 by the DMSO-d6 solvent, and the ratio of integrated pyridine peaks
to the integrated phenyl peaks is just ∼1:6 as opposed to 6:6
(Supporting Information, Figure S8). Consequently,
we made sure to perform elemental analysis as soon as the crystals
were taken out of the solution. Similar to the ethylenediamine samples,
single crystals of (3) were found to feature a selenium
to lead ratio of 2.10:1 (Table 2).

Ethylenediamine Complex, (en)Pb(SePh)2 (1)
The ethylenediamine complex of
the PbSe precursor was
characterized by NMR spectroscopy as well as electrospray ionization
mass spectrometry. A combination of 1H, 13C,
and 77Se solution NMR spectroscopy confirms that the precursor
is solubilized by ethylenediamine. 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy reveal that both phenyl rings of 1 are in the same chemical environment. The 1H NMR spectrum
of this complex shows a distinct splitting pattern of the phenyl rings
and two singlets arising from protons of ethylenediamine (Figure 1). Integration of
the 1H NMR resonances is consistent with the structural
formula (C2H8N2)Pb(SeC6H5)2 (Supporting Information, Figure S1). The splitting pattern of the phenyl rings of 1 is comprised of 3 signals (a doublet of doublets and two
triplets) corresponding to 3 unique phenyl hydrogen chemical environments.
This is in contrast to the splitting pattern of the phenyl rings in
diphenyl diselenide that have the signals from the meta- and para-protons merged together to form a multiplet
(Figure 1b). Moreover,
the resonances for 1 are observed upfield as compared
to the proton signals from diphenyl diselenide. This is consistent
with the presence of an electropositive Pb atom negating the effect
of selenium in deshielding the protons. The resonances of the coordinated
ethylenediamine ligand of 1 are observed downfield as
compared to signals from pure ethylenediamine (Figure 1c). The 13C NMR spectrum of 1 has 4 signals corresponding to 4 different carbons Ci, Co, Cm, and Cp present in the
phenyl group and a signal corresponding to carbons from ethylenediamine
(Figure S2, Supporting Information). Significant
differences in chemical shifts were observed in the 13C
NMR spectrum of 1 as compared to the 13C NMR
spectra of diphenyl diselenide and ethylenediamine, providing further
evidence of complex formation (Figure S3, Supporting Information). A 77Se NMR resonance was also
observed at 188.2 ppm, indicating that selenium is in a single chemical
environment. The 77Se NMR signal of the PbSe precursor
appears significantly upfield as compared to the 77Se NMR
signal of diphenyl diselenide, which has a chemical shift of δ
= 450.9 ppm (Figure S4, Supporting Information).
The shielding of selenium atoms (Pauling’s electronegativity
χ = 2.55) observed in the case of (en)Pb(SePh)2 as
compared to diphenyl diselenide is due to their coordination to an
electropositive lead atom (Pauling’s electronegativity χ
= 1.87). This is consistent with the high shielding observed in (Ph)3Pb–Se–Pb(Ph)3 (δ = −454
ppm), in which selenium is surrounded by two lead atoms.31 We attempted to collect signals for 207Pb nuclei in solution for 1 both at room temperature
and low temperature (−40 °C), but were unable to obtain
a signal. This might be due to an exchange of coordinating ethylenediamine
ligands that is faster than the NMR timescale. Nonobservance of the
lead signal has been reported for mixed ligand species of PhSe–1 and PhS–1 for lead complexes by
Dean.32 Similarly, Rekken et al. did not
observe a lead signal for their lithium tristhiolato plumbate (LiPb(SArMe6)3) complex.33

Electrospray ionization
mass spectrometry on the solution of 1 in ethylenediamine
detected the most intense ion cluster
at an m/z of 676.9, which corresponds
to triligated [PbSe3C18H15]−1 ions (Figure 2).
Other ion clusters were detected with lower intensities at m/z 156.9, 312.9, 434.9, and 554.8. The
ion cluster at m/z 156.9 corresponds
to [SeC6H5]−1 ions. These
ion clusters possess a rich isotopic distribution pattern that originates
from the numerous isotopes of lead and selenium. Our ion cluster identification
is corroborated by an isotopic distribution comparison between our
measured mass spectra and simulated mass spectra (Figure S5, Supporting Information). The ion clusters with
low intensities at 312.9, 434.9, and 554.8 remain unidentified. Usually,
fragmentation of molecules is observed in mass spectrometry, but on
rare occasions, additive processes can occur, especially when the
metal ions can coordinate with multiple ligands. The atomic composition
of (C2H8N2)Pb(SeC6H5)2 indicated by our elemental analysis data suggests
that an additive process occurs to create the triligated [PbSe3C18H15]−1 ions.

Figure 2 Mass spectrum
of the PbSe precursor. Ion clusters at m/z 676.8 and 156.9 correspond to [PbSe3C18H15]−1 ions and [SeC6H5]−1 ions.

We hypothesize that triligated [PbSe3C18H15]−1 ions are formed during the electrospray
ionization process, resulting from the attachment of a [SeC6H5]−1 ligand to the neutral Pb(SeC6H5)2 molecule. To confirm this hypothesis,
we carried out an additional experiment during which 10 mM of potassium
iodide was added to the solution of 1 in ethylenediamine
to assist ionization. We observed that iodide ions (I–1) attach to neutral Pb(SeC6H5)2 molecules,
resulting in detection of an additional ion cluster at m/z 646.7 corresponding to the [PbSe2C12H10I]−1 ions (Figure S6, Supporting Information). During these experiments
with potassium iodide, the triligated [PbSe3C18H15]−1 ions continued to be observed
in greater intensity than the [PbSe2C12H10I]−1 ions. Lowering of the fragmentor voltage
as well as the temperatures of the drying and sheath gas decreased
the ratio of triligated [PbSe3C18H15]−1 ions to [PbSe2C12H10I]−1 ions, but formation of the triligated
[PbSe3C18H15]−1 ions continued to persist in all cases. This indicates that the
neutral molecule Pb(SeC6H5)2 has
a greater tendency to ionize itself by utilizing [SeC6H5]−1 as a ligand as compared to iodide ions
(I–1). This occurrence of additive processes in
mass spectrometry has also been observed for tin(II) phenylchalcogenolates,
resulting in the detection of triligated ions in the corresponding
mass spectra.3

Pyridine complex, (py)2Pb(SePh)2
The crystal structure of 2 (deposited with #1955117
in the CCDC database), obtained from single crystals grown from pyridine,
is composed of isolated (py)2Pb(SePh)2 molecules
(Figure 3). This complex
crystallized in a monoclinic space group (P1211), and restraints were required to keep the refinement stable.
Importantly, 2 was found to feature a seesaw molecular
geometry and axial pyridine ligands with an N(1)-Pb(1)-N(2) angle
of 176.1(2)°. In the equatorial plane, one positionally disordered
phenylselenolate moiety was identified, with an occupancy ratio of
0.539(1)–0.461(1) for the renderings in Figure 3, respectively. The phenylselenolate ligands
are separated by Se(1)–Pb(1)–Se(2) and Se(1)–Pb(1)–Se(2′)
angles of only 78.14(14) and 84.12(18)°, respectively, which
is consistent with the presence of a lone pair of electrons at the
third equatorial site. The feature has been noted for the perfluorinated
variant of this complex, (py)2Pb(SeC5F5)2,34 as well as Pb(SeCH2CH2NMe2)2,35 which features two chelating 2-(dimethylamino)ethylselenolate
ligands. Additional crystallographic data for 2 is presented
in Tables S2–S8 of the Supporting
Information, and the unit cell packing is shown in Figure S7 of the Supporting Information. Finally, we note
that our attempts to collect multinuclear NMR data for 2 dissolved in DMSO-d6 were unsuccessful
due to pyridine ligand substitution by DMSO-d6. This led to the observation of (DMSO-d6)2Pb(SePh)2 (4, refer to
“Observation of (DMSO-d6)2Pb(SePh)2 (4)” in Experimental Methods
and Figures S8 and S9 in the Supporting
Information).

disorder

ratio of 0.54 for the disordered ligand indicated by nonprime Se and
C atoms. (b) Molecule with the occupancy ratio of 0.46 for the disordered
ligand indicated by prime Se and C atoms.

One-Dimensional (1-D) Polymeric Chains of Pb(SePh)2
Single-crystal XRD analysis of 3, which was
crystallized from DMSO, revealed the presence of 1-D polymeric chains
(Figure S10, Supporting Information) consistent
with those found in the solid-state structures of other metal phenylchalcogenolates,1−5 including lead(II) phenylthiolate.4,5 However, the
structure of 3 could not be fully solved due to inversion
twinning and disorder (refer to Discussion S1, Supporting Information). Due to the presence of molecular chains
in the crystal structure, layering was easily observed for 3 in optical and SEM images (Figure S11, Supporting Information). We also redissolved the single-crystal
specimens of 3 in DMSO-d6 and collected 1H and 13C NMR spectra. This
led to the observation of 4 (refer to “Observation
of (DMSO-d6)2Pb(SePh)2 (4)” in Experimental Methods and Figures S12 and S13 in the Supporting Information).

Reaction Mechanism
Our ability to grow crystals of 2 from a pyridine solution indicates that our previously described
PbSe precursors are comprised of lead(II) phenylselenolate moieties
that coordinate to two functional groups. The solvents used in our
prior work30 can solubilize lead either
via nitrogen as in the case of pyridine, ethylenediamine, and butylamine
or via oxygen/sulfur as in the case of dimethyl sulfoxide. Similar
donor solvent-mediated reactions have been previously observed for
elemental zinc and sulfur.36 The above
characterizations identify the PbSe precursor as solubilized lead(II)
phenylselenolate and enable us to postulate on the formation mechanism
that occurs during the reaction of lead with diphenyl diselenide.
We believe that the lead(II) phenylselenolate forms by an oxidative
addition reaction during which Pb is oxidized to the +2 oxidation
state upon cleavage of the Se–Se bond in diphenyl diselenide.
Similar reaction mechanisms have been observed for other metals (e.g.,
tin, indium, and thallium) when reacted with diphenyl diselenide.37,38

Our synthetic route enables lead(II) phenylselenolate to be
used as a solution-processable precursor for PbSe. Our use of ethylenediamine,
pyridine, or dimethyl sulfoxide as the solvent yielded solubilized
lead(II) phenylselenolate, which has otherwise been reported as insoluble
during its synthesis in methanol using benzeneselenol as the selenium
source.32 Lead(II) phenylselenolate synthesized
by our route using diphenyl diselenide instead of benzeneselenol is
advantageous because of the easy handling of diphenyl diselenide (solid
at room temperature) over benzeneselenol, which is an intensely malodorous
liquid39 with high vapor pressure.

Conclusions
We identified the molecular structure of a soluble PbSe precursor
as solvated lead(II) phenylselenolate and detailed its corresponding
solid-state structure. The precursor is synthesized by reacting elemental
lead with diphenyl diselenide in ethylenediamine, dimethyl sulfoxide,
or pyridine as a solvent. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy
confirms the formation of (en)Pb(SePh)2 for the precursor
prepared in ethylenediamine. Single-crystal XRD revealed the molecular
structure as (py)2Pb(SePh)2 for a crystal grown
from pyridine, whereas 1-D polymeric chains of Pb(SePh)2 were observed in crystals grown from dimethyl sulfoxide. We believe
that lead(II) phenylselenolate forms via an oxidative addition reaction.

Experimental
Methods
PbSe Precursor Synthesis
The PbSe precursor solution
can be synthesized by mixing equimolar amounts of lead and diphenyl
diselenide in ethylenediamine, pyridine, or dimethyl sulfoxide as
reported previously.30 In this work, a
2:1 molar ratio of lead to diphenyl diselenide was utilized to ensure
that the diphenyl diselenide had reacted completely and thus eliminated
the possibility of solubilized diphenyl diselenide in the precursor
solution. All syntheses were conducted in a nitrogen-filled glovebox.

Preparation of (en)Pb(SePh)2 (1)
For synthesis using a 2:1 molar ratio of lead to diphenyl diselenide,
0.265 g of lead (1.28 mmol) and 0.200 g of diphenyl diselenide (0.64
mmol) were added to 2 mL of ethylenediamine. The resulting mixture
was stirred for 24 h and then filtered using a PTFE filter with a
pore size of 0.45 μm and a diameter of 25 mm. Subsequent drying
afforded 0.310 g of 1. Lowering the amount of lead to
0.133 g (0.64 mmol) and using a 13 mm diameter filter afforded a similar
product amount of 0.334 g of 1. 1H NMR (500
MHz, DMSO-d6): δ 7.41 (dd, 4 H, J = 7.0 and 1.2 Hz; phenyl), 7.04 (pseudo-t, 4 H, J = 7.2 Hz; phenyl), 6.98 (t, 2 H, J = 7.2 Hz; phenyl), 2.86 (s, 4 H; en), 2.59 (s, 4 H; en). 13C NMR (126 MHz, DMSO-d6): δ
135.4 (phenyl), 133.8 (phenyl), 127.9 (phenyl), 123.9 (phenyl), 43.1
(CH2). 77Se NMR (76.2 MHz, DMSO-d6): δ 188.2. 207Pb NMR resonances were
not observed at room temperature or at low temperature (−40
°C).

Preparation of (py)2Pb(SePh)2 (2) and Subsequent Crystallization
We mixed 0.530 g of lead
(2.56 mmol) and 0.400 g of diphenyl diselenide (1.28 mmol) in 4 mL
of pyridine. The resulting mixture was stirred for 24 h and then filtered
using a PTFE filter with a pore size of 0.45 μm and a diameter
of 25 mm. Single crystals of 2 were obtained by transferring
this reaction solution into a 20 mL glass vial and slowly evaporating
the pyridine solvent in a nitrogen-filled glovebox. This slow evaporation
was done by sealing the top of the vial with a paraffin film and piercing
it with a few small holes. After approximately 5 days, clear pale-yellow
block-like crystals of 2 were obtained.

Preparation
of Pb(SePh)2 (3) and Subsequent
Crystallization
We mixed 0.265 g of lead (1.28 mmol) and
0.200 g of diphenyl diselenide (0.64 mmol) in 2 mL of DMSO. The resulting
mixture was stirred for 24 h and then filtered using a PTFE filter
with a pore size of 0.45 μm and a diameter of 25 mm. Single-crystal
specimens of 3 were obtained by transferring this reaction
solution into a 20 mL glass vial and evaporating the DMSO solvent
in a nitrogen-filled glovebox. This evaporation was done by sealing
the top of the vial with a paraffin film and piercing it with a few
small holes. After approximately 7 days, clear light orange-yellow
rectangular parallelepipedal crystals of 3 precipitated
from the solution.

Observation of (DMSO-d6)2Pb(SePh)2 (4)
Complex 4 can be observed by dissolving 3 in DMSO-d6. 1H NMR (500 MHz,
DMSO-d6): 7.43 (d, 4 H, J = 6.9 Hz; phenyl),
7.12 (t, 4 H, J = 7.4 Hz; phenyl), 7.03 (t, 2 H, J = 7.3 Hz; phenyl), 3.33 (impurity – H2O), 2.54 (impurity – dimethyl sulfoxide). 13C NMR
(126 MHz, DMSO-d6): 135.4 (phenyl), 132.2
(phenyl), 128.1 (phenyl), 124.4 (phenyl), 40.4 (impurity –
dimethyl sulfoxide). Complex 4 can also be observed when 2 is dissolved in DMSO-d6; pyridine
ligand substitution by DMSO is evidenced by observation of free pyridine
in the 1H NMR spectrum. 1H NMR (500 MHz, DMSO-d6): 8.60–8.55 (m; free pyridine), 7.78
(tt, J = 7.6 and 1.9 Hz; free pyridine), 7.43 (d,
4 H, J = 6.6 Hz; phenyl), 7.40–7.36 (m; free
pyridine), 7.11 (t, 4 H, J = 7.5 Hz; phenyl), 7.02
(t, 2 H, J = 7.3 Hz; phenyl), 3.33 (impurity –
H2O). 13C NMR (126 MHz, DMSO-d6): 149.6 (free pyridine), 136.1 (free pyridine), 135.5
(phenyl), 132.2 (phenyl), 128.1 (phenyl), 124.4 (phenyl), 123.9 (free
pyridine).

Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission
Spectroscopy (ICP-OES)
ICP-OES measurements were conducted
using a Thermo iCAP6300. The
sample was prepared by drying the PbSe precursor solution under vacuum
for 2 h. Approximately, 15 mg of 1 was then dissolved
in 3 mL of nanopure water and 5 mL of trace metal grade nitric acid.
The solution was then diluted by a factor of 100 with nanopure water
to ensure that the acid concentration was compatible with the instrument.
Similarly, 3 mg of the single-crystal specimens of 3 were
dissolved in 1 mL of nanopure water and 2 mL of trace metal grade
nitric acid. Dilution by a factor of 100 with nanopure water was carried
out for this single-crystal sample as well.

Combustion Analysis
The carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen
chemical composition of the products was analyzed using a PE 2400
elemental analyzer. Approximately, 3 mg of 1, 2, and 3 were weighed in a tin cup and then subjected
to flash combustion. The instrument’s combustion and reduction
zones were 980 and 640 °C, respectively. The resulting gases
were separated in a gas chromatography column and analyzed using a
thermal conductivity detector to quantify the carbon, hydrogen, and
nitrogen content. Blank runs were performed after each run to ensure
complete combustion of the sample.

Nuclear Magnetic Resonance
(NMR) Spectroscopy
1H and 13C NMR measurements
were conducted on 1, aged 2, and 3 dissolved in DMSO-d6 at a concentration
of 9.5, 9, and 0.6 wt %,
respectively. The 1H and 13C NMR spectra were
collected on a Bruker Avance NEO 500 MHz NMR spectrometer. 1H spectra were collected with a sweep width of 11 904.8 Hz;
a relaxation delay of 5 s and 32 signal averages and referenced internally
to the chemical shift of the tetramethylsilane. 13C spectra
were collected with a sweep width of 34 246.6 Hz, a relaxation
delay of 2 s, and 256 signal averages and referenced to the chemical
shift of the solvent, DMSO-d6 (39.5 ppm). 77Se NMR measurements were conducted using a Varian VNMRS 400
MHz NMR spectrometer on 1 dissolved in DMSO-d6 at a concentration of 9.5 wt %. 77Se NMR
spectra were collected with a sweep width of 37 878.8 Hz, a
relaxation delay of 6 s, and 48 signal averages. A 0.5 M solution
of dimethyl diselenide in CDCl3 was used as an external
chemical shift reference (269 ppm).40 Moreover, 77Se NMR measurements were conducted on diphenyl diselenide
dissolved in DMSO-d6 at a concentration
of 10 wt %.

Mass Spectrometry
Electrospray ionization
mass spectrometry
was performed using an Agilent 6530 quadrupole time of flight mass
spectrometer operated in negative ion detection mode. The glass capillary
was subjected to a voltage of 3500 V. The temperature and the flow
rate of the drying and sheath gases were maintained at 120 °C
and 12 L/min, respectively. The nebulizer pressure was 60 psig, and
the fragmentor voltage was 175 V. The ethylenediamine solution of 1 was diluted to a concentration of ∼2 mg/mL and then
further diluted to a concentration ∼1 mg/mL using methanol.
Approximately, 100 μL of the sample solution was directly infused
into the instrument using a syringe pump at a flow rate of ∼100
μL/min. The numerous isotopes of Pb and Se yielded rich isotopic
distributions in the spectral patterns. All m/z values given in the text correspond to the most abundant
peak of the respective isotopic distributions.

Scanning Electron
Microscopy and Optical Microscopy
We observed the single-crystal
specimen of 2 and 3 using a Zeiss Axio Zoom.V16
optical microscope at a low
magnification of 25× as well as using an Amray 1910 field emission
SEM at a magnification of 1000× and 5000×.

Single-Crystal
X-ray Diffraction
A single-crystal specimen
of 2 of approximate dimensions 0.12 mm × 0.18 mm
× 0.22 mm was used for the X-ray crystallographic analysis using
a Bruker Smart APEX single-crystal diffractometer with Mo Kα
radiation. The specimen was mounted on the tip of a glass fiber using
a small amount of Apiezon type N grease. The temperature of the crystal
was maintained at 123 K using an Oxford Cryosystems Cryostream 600
low-temperature device. The detector was maintained at 5 cm from the
crystal. Data was collected in 3 sets by setting φ angles for
each set (φ = 0, 120, and 240°) and varying ω (326–144°
in −0.5° wide scans per frame at each φ angle),
2θ (−34°) and χ (54.8°). A total of 1092
frames were collected at a rate of 30 s per frame. The frames were
integrated with the Bruker SAINT software package using a narrow-frame
algorithm.41 Data were corrected for absorption
effects using the multiscan method (SADABS).41 The structure was solved by direct methods using the SHELXTL XT-2014/4
program42 and was refined by a full-matrix
least-squares method on F2 values using
the SHELXL-2014/7 program.43 The crystal
data and structure refinement details for 2 are summarized
in Table 3, and additional
details of data collection and refinement are included in Table S1, Supporting Information. A single-crystal
specimen of 3 of approximate dimensions 0.06 mm ×
0.13 mm × 0.37 mm was analyzed in a similar manner.
