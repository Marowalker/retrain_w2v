In this article, the synthesis, structural
studies, and luminescence
properties of CuI, AgI, and AuI complexes
of pyrimidine-based phosphine [C4H3N2-2-NH(CH2PPh2)] (1) are described.
The reactions of 1 with CuX led to the isolation of one-dimensional
(1D) chain, tetranuclear ladder, or cyclic derivatives. The structural
features of these complexes are greatly influenced by the metal-to-ligand
ratio, reaction conditions, and CuX (X = Cl, Br or I) employed. In
the case of CuCl and CuBr, one-dimensional coordination polymers [{CuCl}{C4H3N2-2-NH(CH2PPh2)}]∞ (2) and [{CuBr}{C4H3N2-2-NH(CH2PPh2)}]∞ (3) were obtained, whereas CuI afforded
tetracopper complex [{CuI}4{C4H3N2-2-NH(CH2PPh2)}2(NCCH3)2] (4) having Cu4 ladder
structure supported by P∩N-bridging coordination of 1. The reaction of 1 with AgOTf yielded unprecedented
one-dimensional chain structure [{AgOTf}{C4H3N2-2-NH(CH2PPh2)}]∞ (5), whereas the reaction with AgBF4 produced
a 12-membered dinuclear complex, [{Ag}{C4H3N2-2-NH(CH2PPh2)}]2[BF4]2 (6), with each silver atom having
a linear geometry. Gold complex [{AuCl}{C4H3N2-2-NH(CH2PPh2)}]2 (7) was synthesized by reacting 1 with [AuCl(SMe2)]. Compounds 2–4 were also
prepared using a pestle and mortar by grinding method in almost quantitative
yield. Complex 4 with a Cu···Cu distance
of 2.828(5) Å shows high luminescence due to the nonbonded metal···metal
interactions.

Introduction
The study of coordination
chemistry of CuI, AgI, and AuI complexes
is quite interesting because of their
structural diversity associated with luminescence properties.1−8 In particular, CuI compounds have been studied in depth
because of their high abundance, relative cost advantage, and strong
emission in both solid and solution states9−11 besides their
catalytic properties.12 Such features make
them favorable and substitute materials to rather expensive platinum
metal-based luminescent complexes.13 The
different structural motifs adopted by CuI complexes starting
from CuX moieties depend to a large extent on the metal-to-ligand
ratios, the steric properties, and the bite separation of the ligands
employed.14−19 Simple tertiary phosphines with moderate bulk adopt cubane-type
structures,20 whereas the others prefer
dimeric structures containing {Cu2(μ-X)2} rhombic units.21,22 Bidentate ligands with flexible
donor arms prefer either tetranuclear ladder or stairstep-type structure.23 All of these complexes contain μ2-, μ3-, or μ4-bridging halide ions.21,24−27

Although CuI chemistry of both short-bite and large-bite
bisphosphine ligands has been extensively studied, similar studies
on CuI complexes of P∩N, P∩O, and P∩S
donor ligands are less extensive. Among hybrid ligands, phosphines
attached to pyridyl groups appear to be an ideal combination due to
the interesting luminescent properties. These complexes often show
multiple emissive triplet excited states.13 Extensive studies by Ford and co-workers28 have shown that the higher energy emissions of [Cu4X4L4] (L = 2-(diphenylmethyl)pyridine or pyridine)
are due to the halide-to-ligand charge-transfer (XLCT) excited states,
and the lower-energy emissions are from an excited state with a mixture
of halide-to-metal charge-transfer (XMCT) and metal-centered orbital
parentage. Complexes having rhomboid core, {Cu2(μ-X)2}, considered to be the monomers of {Cu4I4} unit, are also emissive.29−32 Copper complexes having {Cu2(μ-X)2} rhomboids have been preferably made due to their luminescence
and also interesting structural features.33 The metal–metal interactions, normally found among CuI, AgI, and AuI ions, have great influence
on the energy and efficiency of emission of the polymetallic complexes
in the solid state and in solution.34−37 As an extension of our interest21,25,38,39 and the interest of others13,31,40−42 in functionalized/hybrid/ambidentate ligands, herein,
we report the synthesis and the structural and photophysical properties
of novel CuI, AgI, and AuI complexes
derived from the pyrimidine-based phosphine, [C4H3N2-2-NH(CH2PPh2)].

Results and Discussion
Pyrimidine-functionalized phosphine [C4H3N2-2-NH(CH2PPh2)] (1) was prepared using a modified procedure reported earlier with improved
yield.43 Treatment of 1 with
1 equiv of CuX (X = Cl and Br) resulted in the formation of one-dimensional
(1D) coordination polymers [{CuX}{C4H3N2-2-NH(CH2 PPh2)}]∞44 [X = Cl (2) and Br (3)], whereas similar reaction with CuI yielded [{CuI}4{C4H3N2-2-NH(CH2PPh2)}2(NCCH3)2] (4) having a ladder structure (Chart 1).

Chart 1 Copper Complexes of Ligand 1
The 31P{1H} NMR spectra of 2–4 showed single
resonances at −14.8,
−14, and −20.7 ppm, respectively. The solid-state 31P cross polarized magic angle spinning (CP-MAS) NMR spectra
of copper complexes 2–4 also showed
resonances in the same region as in the solution spectra but as 1:1:1:1
quartets due to 63,65Cu–P coupling. The mass spectra
of 2 and 3 showed peaks at 356.0591 and
356.0318, respectively, corresponding to the [M – X]+ ion (calcd 356.0378).

Solid-state structures of complexes 2–4 were established from single-crystal
X-ray analysis. The
perspective views of the molecular structures of 2–4 are shown in Figures 1 and 2. In complex 2,
two CuI ions are in tetrahedral environment, each containing
two μ2-Cl ions and two bridging P∩N(pyrimidine)
ligands. The N1–Cu1–P1′, N1–Cu1–Cl1′,
N1–Cu1–Cl1, and Cl1–Cu1–Cl1′ bond
angles are 122.46(5), 99.12(5), 106.80(5), and 103.93(16)°, respectively.45 The {Cu2(μ2-Cl)2} units adopt parallelogram configuration with a Cu1···Cu1′
distance of 2.951(5) Å, which lies in the range observed in analogous
complexes containing bridging P∩N ligands (2.872–3.303
Å).46 The molecular structure of 3 is similar to that of 2 with a Cu1···Cu1′
distance of 3.000(6) Å. In both the complexes, one of the pyrimidine
nitrogen and phosphorus atoms is coordinated to two {Cu2(μ2-X)2} units to generate a 12-membered
repeating unit to form a one-dimensional chain (see Figure S12, Supporting Information (SI)).

115.47(2), and P1–Cu2–I2 119.28(2).

In the case of 4, two iodide ions, due to their
larger
size, show μ3-bridging mode, thus leading to the
formation of a tetrameric complex with a ladder-type structure. The
two fused molecular Cu2I2 rhomboids are stabilized
by two μ2-P∩N and two acetonitrile ligands
in addition to two μ3-I and two μ2-I ions, as depicted in Figure 2. Copper atoms are arranged in a rectangular array
with Cu···Cu distances in the range of 2.828–3.474
Å. The Cu1···Cu2′ distance of 2.828(5)
Å in 4 indicates weak metal–metal interactions
(see Figure S17, SI).47,48 These interactions induce considerable change in the luminescence
properties.49 The Cu–P bond distance
is 2.235(7) Å.50 The Cu–I (μ3-I) bond distances vary from 2.695(4) to 2.752(4) Å and
are marginally longer than the Cu–I (μ2-I)
bond distances of 2.605(4) and 2.635(4) Å.23 Complexes 2–4 have crystallographically
imposed center of symmetry.

It is interesting to compare the
Cu···Cu, P–N,
and P–P bond distances in di-, tri-, and tetranuclear complexes
of various P∩P and P∩N ligands (Table 1) to get some insight into the bite of the
ligands versus the preference for different {CuX}n structural scaffolds (Chart 2). Copper complexes adopting different {CuX} motifs show Cu···Cu,
P–N, and P–P distances in the ranges 2.524–3.637,
2.726–5.029, and 2.884–6.411 Å, respectively. Usually,
short-bite bidentate ligands form ladder-, stairstep-, or rhomboid
(II)-based coordination polymers, whereas the large-bite bidentate
ligands form either cubane- (V) or ladder-based coordination polymers
(VII), metallocycles, or three-dimensional network depending on the
rigidity of the ligand framework and the halide ions.14,21,23

Some short-bite
bidentate ligands show rare tetrameric structure
with four copper atoms being coplanar containing μ2- and μ4-halide ions.14,54 Their luminescent
properties are greatly influenced by copper···copper
distances.47 Complexes with Cu···Cu
distances below 2.7 Å are expected to show Cu–Cu bonding
interactions, and those with Cu···Cu separations of
more than 2.7 Å may show nonbonding interactions. The stairstep-type
structures show shortest Cu···Cu distances in the range
of 2.65–2.8 Å55−57 and show characteristic (3CC) cluster-centered excited-state emissions. However, those
with Cu···Cu distances longer than 2.8 Å do not
show any significant Cu···Cu interactions, and luminescence
in such complexes is merely due to the halide-to-ligand charge-transfer
(3XLCT) excited-state emissions.13

The 1:1 reaction of 1 with AgOTf yielded an unprecedented
1D coordination polymer [{AgOTf}{C4H3N2-2-NH(CH2PPh2)}]∞ (5) (Chart 3). Similar reaction between 1 and AgBF4 produced
a 12-membered dinuclear complex with silver atoms having linear geometry
as shown in Chart 3. The 31P{1H} spectra of 5 and 6 showed broad singlets at 8.3 and 9.9 ppm, respectively.
The 19F NMR spectra of 5 and 6 showed singlets at −77.84 and −148.24 ppm, respectively,
for triflate and tetrafluoroborate ions.58 IR spectrum of 5 showed bands around 1591, 1262, and
1025 cm–1 for νC=N, coordinated triflate
(νS=O) anions, and νC–F bonds,
respectively (see Figure S22, SI).59 The large shift of N–H (7.05 ppm) proton
in complex (free ligand 5.50 ppm) indicates the presence of H-bonding
between N–H proton and BF4 ion. The mass spectra
of both 5 and 6 showed peaks at 400.0127
due to the similar m/z = 400.0127
[M – OTf]+ and [M – BF4]+ (calcd 490.0127), although the former is polymeric in nature (Figure 3).

Chart 3 Silver and Gold Complexes of Ligand 1
The molecular structure of 5 (Figure 4) confirmed the zigzag
1D chain structure
in which ligand 1 bridges the two silver atoms with each
silver atom having a trigonal planar geometry coordinated by P∩N
and triflate ion. The N2–Ag1–P2, N2–Ag1–O1
and P2–Ag1–O1 bond angles are 140.30(11), 98.18(17),
and 113.58(14)°, respectively (Figure 4b). The Ag–P, Ag–N, and Ag–O
bond distances are in the ranges of 2.379(13)–2.406(13), 2.278(4)–2.286(4),
and 2.382(4)–2.501(4) Å, respectively, and are comparable
to those found in [μ-(Bzim)PPh2Ag(NO3)]2.60 The different types of 1D chains
found in the case of copper and silver complexes are due to their
structural flexibility to have linear, trigonal, or tetrahedral geometries.61

The solid-state molecular
structure (Figure 5) of 6 consists of a dimeric
structure composed of a 12-membered ring with ligand showing head-to-tail
coordination involving phosphorus and pyrimidine nitrogen atoms. Compound 6 has crystallographically imposed center of symmetry, and
the silver atoms possess nearly linear geometry with a P1–Ag1′–N1′
angle of 166.92(2)°. The intramolecular Ag1···Ag1′
separation is 4.579 Å.62 The difference
between 5 and 6 is in agreement with the
preference of AgI to form dicoordinate complexes,61,63,64 in the absence of other Lewis
bases or counteranions. Both the BF4 anions exhibit H-bonding
with the metallacycle by virtue of N–H···F and
C–H···F H-bonds (Figure S27), as evidenced by 1H NMR spectral data. The
Ag1–P1 and Ag1–N1 bond distances are 2.352(2) and 2.174(8)
Å, respectively.

The equimolar reaction of 1 and [AuCl(SMe2)] in dichloromethane afforded [{AuCl}{C4H3N2-2-NH(CH2PPh2)}]2 (7) as an off-white solid (Chart 3). The 31P{1H} NMR
spectrum of 7 showed a singlet at 26 ppm. In this case
also, considerable downfield shift of N–H proton was observed,
indicating the possible involvement of N–H proton in H-bonding.
The mass spectrum of 7 is consistent with the formation
of compound m/z = 490.0743 [M –
Cl]+ ion (calcd 490.0742). The X-ray structure of 7 confirmed the linear geometry around gold atom and the dimeric
nature of the complex via hydrogen bonding,65,66 as depicted in Figure 6. The Au1–P1 (2.229(13) Å) and Au1–Cl1 (2.301(13)
Å) bond distances are found in the expected range.67 The P1–Au1–Cl1 bond angle is 177.68(4)°.68 The intermolecular hydrogen bonding between
N–H and pyrimidine nitrogen atoms resulted in the formation
of eight-membered N2–H6–N6–C31–N5–H3–N3–C14
ring. The N–H···N bond distances (H3···N5
2.174 Å and H6···N2 2.077 Å) are in the typical
range of hydrogen bonds.69 The N2···N6
and N3···N5 distances are 2.952 and 3.037 Å, whereas
the N2···H6–N6 and N5···H3–N3
angles are 172.74 and 166.18°, respectively.

Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD)
patterns were recorded for 2–7 before
and after grinding (Figure 3). The immaculateness
of the bulk powdered sample is affirmed by the diffraction peaks related
to those calculated from single-crystal X-ray data (Figure 3). The PXRD analysis data of
complexes 2–7 after grinding reveal
that new crystalline phase is formed during the grinding process as
no new diffraction peaks were observed in it. However, the intensities
of the diffraction peaks of complexes 2–7 after grinding decreased with an increase in the widths.
Further, these changes may be due to the crystallite size anisotropy
and their preferred orientations under the influence of grinding.70 As depicted in Figure 3, the PXRD patterns of complexes 2–7 after grinding show broader patterns due to
one or more stacking faults71 incurred
during grinding. The change in the color of complexes 2–4 after grinding may be due to the change in
the particle size, which affects the optical properties of the whole
sample. This is well documented in the literature.72,73

Solid-State Reaction
In recent years, synthetic chemists
have attracted much attention
toward developing the methodologies, which are inexpensive, recyclable,
and eco-friendly, mainly due to the growing environmental concerns.74−76 A reaction performed under solvent-free condition or using solid
support provides many advantages over the routine solution-mediated
synthesis77 in terms of product yield,
reaction time, environmentally benign condition, ease of separation
of the products and their purification, and also the recyclability
of the support,78 thus minimizing the generation
of toxic and nontoxic waste and the problems associated with the disposal
of the solvents.79,80

In this context, the synthesis
of complexes 2–4 was attempted by
grinding a mixture of ligand 1 and appropriate metal
precursors using a pestle and mortar for a
period of 5–10 min. Compounds 2g–4g obtained in pure form in almost quantitative yield are
found to be slightly different from compounds 2–4 evidenced by 31P{1H} NMR data (see Figures S31–S33, SI). Further, the PXRD
analysis data of these complexes showed different patterns compared
to those calculated from the single-crystal X-ray diffraction data
(Figure 7). To confirm
the solvent effect, the complexes prepared by grinding methods were
stirred in a 1:1 CH2Cl2/CH3CN solution
for 30 min; solvents were removed under reduced pressure, dried, and
subjected to PXRD analysis. Surprisingly, the PXRD patterns were found
to be similar to those made by conventional methods (Figure 7) but with little peak broadening
as expected due to the mechanical effect. The purity of the above
complexes is confirmed by 31P{1H} NMR data,
elemental analysis data, and melting point observations.

conventional method A (2, 3, and 4).

Photophysical Studies
The electronic
absorption spectra of compounds 1–7 were examined in acetonitrile and dichloromethane at room
temperature and are given in Figures 8 and 9. In both the solvents,
the intense UV absorption bands appearing in the range of 218–250
nm for 1–7 are ascribed to ligand-based
π–π* transitions. In addition to the high-energy
absorption bands, low-energy shoulder bands are observed around 291–312
nm for 2–7. These low-lying bands
are attributed to the MLCT transitions involving CuI/AgI/AuI ions81 and the
ligand skeleton. The emission spectrum of compound 2 in
acetonitrile showed red shift (2 nm), whereas that of 4–7 showed blue shifts of 12, 4, 6, and 5 nm,
respectively, relative to 1, and 3 did not
show any notable change.

Figure 8 UV–visible absorption and emission spectra
of 1–7 recorded in acetonitrile (1
× 10–5 M). Enlarged view of low-energy absorption
bands
is shown in the inset.

Figure 9 UV–visible absorption and emission spectra of 1–7 recorded in dichloromethane (1 × 10–5 M). Enlarged view of low-energy absorption bands
is shown in the inset.

Compounds 1–7 on excitation
around
270 nm in dichloromethane showed emissions in the range of 368–436
nm. Compounds 2–7 showed blue shifts
of 65, 68, 62, 56, 57, and 8 nm, respectively, relative to 1, which is in contrast to the trend observed in acetonitrile, where
red shift for 2 and no change for 3 were
observed.82 The difference in emission
pattern is due to the different polarities of the solvents, and the
details are available in the literature.83,84

The disparity in the emissive behavior of 2–4 can also be attributed to (i) the effects of different Cu–Cu
bond lengths in these complexes and (ii) the rigid coordination environment
enforced by the bidentate P∩N ligand that stabilizes the molecular
geometry in the 3XLCT state.13 Absorptions, emissions, and relative quantum yields of 1–7 are summarized in Table 2. The emission spectra of compounds 2–4 are also recorded in the solid state.
Luminescence images under UV irradiation showing color changes before
and after grinding of complexes 2–4 made from solution method are shown in Figure 10, whereas the solid-state emission spectra
are given in Figure 11.

a Reported relative quantum yields
were determined by using naphthalene (ϕ = 0.23, excitation at
270 nm in cyclohexane) as the standard compound.

b λmax values were
recorded in acetonitrile and dichloromethane.

Before grinding, the emission maxima of 2 and 4 were 537 and 460 nm, respectively, and after
grinding, 2 showed blue shift and appeared at 487 nm,
whereas compound 4 after grinding showed red shift and
appeared at 534 nm.
But in the case of 3, no notable change in its emission
color as well as in emission maxima before and after grinding was
observed.75 This may be due to the morphological
changes occurred in the complexes (2–4) upon grinding. This kind of phenomenon is well documented in the
earlier reports.85,86

Conclusions
Several
CuI, AgI, and AuI complexes
of pyrimidine-based phosphine ligand were synthesized and structurally
characterized. Copper complexes adopted Cu2X2 rhombic units to form either one-dimensional coordination polymers
or tetranuclear ladder-type complexes. A rare pyrimidine–phosphine-coordinated
disilver complex with silver adopting linear geometry has been isolated
and structurally characterized. Gold complex due to the intermolecular
hydrogen bonding between the pyrimidine molecules forms a dimer. The
copper complex 2 showed red shift, whereas complexes 3–4 showed blue shift relative to the
free ligand 1. The dissimilarity in emission behavior
of CuI complexes can be attributed to the difference in
metal···metal bond distances. Interestingly, all copper
complexes were also prepared using a pestle and mortar in almost quantitative
yields but with very different morphology and fluorescence properties.

Experimental
Section
General Procedures
All manipulations were performed
using the standard vacuum line and Schlenk techniques under dry nitrogen
or argon. Solvents were dried by standard methods and distilled prior
to use. CuX [X = Cl and Br]87 and [AuCl(SMe2)]88 were prepared using reported
methods. CuI was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used as received.

Instrumental Methods
The 1H and 31P{1H} NMR (δ in ppm) spectra were obtained from
either Bruker Avance-400 MHz or 500 MHz spectrometer. The spectra
were recorded in CDCl3 (or dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)-d6) solutions with CDCl3 (or DMSO-d6) as an internal lock; tetramethylsilane and
85% H3PO4 were used as internal and external
standards for 1H and 31P{1H} NMR,
respectively. The solid-state 31P NMR spectra were recorded
on a Bruker AV-500 MHz spectrometer with magic angle spinning (MAS)
at 12 kHz. Positive values indicate downfield shifts. The UV–vis
and fluorescence spectra were recorded at 298 K on PerkinElmer UV–vis
and fluorescence spectrometers, respectively, using a quartz cell
(1 cm width). Mass spectra were recorded on a Bruker mass spectrometer
using electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) method. Microanalysis
was carried out on a Carlo Erba (model 1106) elemental analyzer. Melting
points of all compounds were determined on a Veego melting point apparatus
and are uncorrected.

X-ray Crystallography
A crystal

studies was mounted in a cryoloop with a drop of paratone oil and
placed in the cold nitrogen stream of the kryoflex attachment of the
Rigaku Saturn724 diffractometer. Data were collected at 100(2)/150(2)
K using graphite-λ monochromated Mo Kα radiation (λα
= 0.71073 Å). The unit cell determination and data reduction
were performed using the Rigaku CrystalClear-SM Expert 2.1 software.
Crystal data and summary of data collection for all compounds are
given in Table 3. The

procedures on F2 with SHELXTL89 package. All nonhydrogen atoms were refined
anisotropically. Hydrogen atoms were placed based on the geometry
and refined with a riding model. Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) was
carried out on EMPYREAN, Malvern Panalytical diffractometer with Cu
