We report here the
synthesis and thorough characterization of a
new family of alkylbiguanides and alkylbiguanidium chlorides by 1H and 13C NMR and X-ray diffraction. Their critical
micelle concentration was first determined by surface tension measurements.
Hexylbiguanide was then studied as a surfactant in the micellar Suzuki–Miyaura
cross-coupling reaction. The unexpected low reactivity of the system
at high Pd/hexylbiguanide ratios was due to the change of the size
and the shape of the aggregates, observed by transmission electron
microscopy. The best catalytic activity was obtained for a 1:1 Pd/hexylbiguanide
ratio for which the micellar conditions were conserved. Better results
were obtained for several substrates, when compared to those previously
obtained with metformin under the same reaction conditions. Higher
yields and a better recyclability were obtained under micellar conditions
with hexylbiguanide.

==== Body
Introduction
Various biguanide derivatives
(Figure 1) have been
shown to possess multiple biological
applications. Their antihyperglycemic properties have been extensively
studied, and metformin hydrochloride became one of the most prescribed
drugs for the treatment of type 2 diabetes patients.1 The antimalarial2 and antimicrobial3 properties of biguanides have also been reported,
as a result of their membrane disruption activity.4 Recently, the capacity of biguanides to inhibit the proliferation
of cancer cells has begun to be considered as a potential anticancer
therapy, and even if their mechanism of action is still uncertain,
the major limitation for their use is considered to be their inadequate
ability to penetrate mitochondria in vivo.5 At physiological pH, biguanides are protonated and are usually found
as hydrophilic chloride salts, also called biguanidium salts.6

and metformin
hydrochloride.

Biguanides can be easily
functionalized with different substituents
at both ends (aryl, benzyl, alkyl, etc.) (Figure 1). The hydrophilic biguanide group can be
incorporated in the design of amphiphilic compounds with surfactant
properties. The self-assembly of surfactants allows the solubilization,
transport, delivery, or extraction of hydrophobic compounds in the
hydrophobic micellar environment7 and finds
several applications as emulsifiers,8 as
drug delivery systems,9 in absorption of
lipids,10 and of course in micellar catalysis.11

Micellar catalysis is a strategy largely
employed in the development
of greener reactions in aqueous media, lowering the impact of chemistry
on the environment.12 It allows water solubilization
of insoluble reactants and also the decrease of the reaction temperature.
Micellar catalysis usually requires the use of an innocent surfactant
or a metallosurfactant. An innocent surfactant does not directly interact
with the metal but only solubilizes a preformed catalyst and usually
enhances its activity.12c A metallosurfactant
includes a ligand moiety, where the metal is directly coordinated
to the surfactant.13 The metallosurfactant
acts as both a mass transfer agent and a ligand, resulting in a major
atom economy of the process.

The self-aggregation properties
of alkylguanidinium (Figure 2) were previously reported
by Song et al.14 for alkyl chains containing
8–12 carbons, with critical micelle concentration (CMC) values
varying from 5 to 75 mM. In 2011, Lin et al. used functionalized alkylguanidinium
salts as ionic liquid solvents in the Suzuki–Miyaura coupling.15 They reported complete conversion after 2 h
at 60 °C with 2 mol % Pd(OAc)2 and 5 equiv of dodecylguanidinium
salt and proposed the formation of micelles to be responsible for
the stabilization of the Pd nanoparticles, allowing the recycling
up to five catalytic runs without significant loss of activity.

Figure 2 Representation
of guanidine and the guanidinium cation.

Regarding its chemical structure, a biguanide is composed
of two
guanidine moieties (Figure 2). Compared to a guanidine or a guanidinium salt, biguanide
has a higher ability to bind metals because of the two “imine-like”
functions and acts as a bidentate ligand. The coordination of different
metals to biguanides has been first reported in 1961,16 but their use as ligands in metal-catalyzed cross-coupling
reactions started only two decades ago. They have been incorporated
in complex systems (mesoporous silica,17 carbon nanotubes,18 fullerene,19 and chitosan20) and
used as ligands for several metal-catalyzed reactions in organic solvents
or mixtures with water. In our seek to develop green catalytic reactions
in neat water and use small ligands to increase the atom economy of
the process, we recently reported the successful use of metformin
hydrochloride as a ligand in the Suzuki–Miyaura coupling in
pure water, at a very low palladium loading (0.0025 mol %).21 As the recycling of the metformin catalyst was
unsuccessful as the catalytic species degraded in water after only
four catalytic runs at 0.5 mol % Pd, we explored the possibility to
using alkylbiguanides as surfactants under micellar conditions for
the Suzuki–Miyaura reaction in water. Herein, we describe the
synthesis, the characterization of alkylbiguanide surfactants, and
their successful application under micellar conditions in the Suzuki–Miyaura
reaction in water.

Results and Discussion
Surfactants Synthesis
The alkylbiguanide dihydrochlorides
were synthesized using the methodology developed by Suyama et al.
in 1989.22 They were obtained in one step,
with moderate to excellent yields, after only 90 min at 100 °C
in 1,4-dioxane and purified as chloride salts by simple precipitation,
by adding hydrochloric acid (Figure 3). It should be mentioned that the reaction was very
sensitive to the concentration of reactants, that needed to be minimum
2 M to obtain high yields. Iron(II) chloride did not play a catalytic
role in the reaction because lower amounts of iron resulted in lower
yields or impure products. Moreover, a higher amount of iron (3 equiv
as reported for some substrates by Suyama et al.22) resulted in no reaction at all, iron probably binding
both dicyandiamide and amine, avoiding them to react. The reaction
was also performed in greener solvents (ethyl acetate, water, acetone,
methanol, and ethanol), but the reaction did not take place or the
obtained product was impure.

Figure 3 Synthesis of alkylbiguanide dihydrochlorides.

X-ray Diffraction
Single crystals of each alkylbiguanide
were obtained by slow evaporation of methanol (1, 2, and 4) or by crystallization at low temperature
in a mixture of methanol and acetone (3). They all appeared
as overlapping plates (twinned crystals), which made their analysis
difficult. Suitable crystals were selected and analyzed on a Bruker
Venture MetalJet diffractometer (Figure 4).

Figure 4 X-ray diffraction analysis of (1) hexylbiguanide
dihydrochloride 1, (2) octylbiguanide dihydrochloride 2, (3)
decylbiguanide dihydrochloride 3, and (4) dodecylbiguanide
dihydrochloride 4.

Alkylbiguanides 1, 2, and 4 are monoclinic P21/c containing four molecules per primitive cell, and 3 is monoclinic C2/c with eight
molecules per primitive cell. In the solid state, they all showed
an organization similar to that of a lipid bilayer, where the hydrophobic
alkyl chains were facing each other inside the primitive cell and
the hydrophilic biguanidium moieties were facing the exterior of the
primitive cell (Figure 5).

Figure 5 Organization of the surfactant in the primitive cell for hexylbiguanide
dihydrochloride (1), octylbiguanide dihydrochloride (2), decylbiguanide
dihydrochloride (3), and dodecylbiguanide dihydrochloride (4).

The alkyl chains did not overlay
in the same plane but organized
themselves in two planes pointing toward opposite directions and forming
an X (the pink and black molecules shown in Figure 5). The longer the alkyl chains were, the
more organized they were in the solid state (Figures 5 and 6).

Figure 6 Torsion angles
in the biguanidium cation.

Furthermore, we observed that the biguanide moiety was not
planar,
the torsion angles between the two guanidinium units being slightly
different for the four salts, with values around 40°, as predicted
by density functional theory calculations by Raczyńska et al.23 (Figure 6).

The four alkylbiguanidium dihydrochlorides had their
double bonds
positioned between C1 and N1 and C2 and N5. This is different from
what was previously reported for metal-coordinated biguanides.24 As Raczyńska et al. previously reported,
the protonation was favored on the imino groups, rather than the amino
groups, because of the n−π conjugation.23 Finally, each molecule possesses two chlorides located
in each plane of a guanidinium cation.

Surface Tension Measurement
and Critical Micelle Concentration
(CMC) Determination
The CMC of each alkylbiguanide was determined
by measuring the evolution of the surface tension with its concentration.
The surface tension was measured with a Wihelmy plate sensor on a
dynamic contact angle meter and a tensiometer (DCAT11) in distilled
water. The CMC was considered the concentration at which the surface
tension reached a plateau (Supporting Information). The CMCs were determined at two temperatures (25 and 60 °C),
in neutral and basic conditions (K2CO3 22 M),
the basic conditions corresponding to the Suzuki–Miyaura reaction
conditions (Table 1).

Table 1 Critical
Micelle Concentration Values
for Compounds 1–4 at 25 and 60 °C
in Neutral and Basic Conditions (K2CO3 22 M) 
compound	1	2	3	4	
CMC at 25 °C (mM)	2.30	2.10	1.80	0.22	
CMC at 60 °C (mM)	2.25	1.50	0.72	0.16	
CMC in basic conditions at 25 °C (mM)	0.40	insoluble  	insoluble	 insoluble	
CMC in basic conditions at 60 °C (mM)	0.55	insoluble  	insoluble  	insoluble  	
The CMC values of the
studied alkylbiguanides were influenced by
the protonation state of the surfactant, the temperature, and the
length of the alkyl chain. Compounds 1–4 were highly soluble in water. However, only 1 remained
soluble in water in basic conditions, its CMC being 5–6 times
lower than the one in neutral conditions. Ionic surfactants usually
possess higher CMC values than those of their nonionic analogues because
they are more water soluble.

At 60 °C, the CMC of biguanidium
surfactants decreased. The
CMC value of neutral surfactant 1 was slightly higher
at 60 °C than the one at 25 °C. Both ionic and nonionic
alkylbiguanide surfactants can form hydrogen bonds with water molecules,
but water molecules stabilize better ionic surfactants because of
their stronger interactions with the charged atoms. All of the protonated
alkylbiguanidium salts showed lower CMCs at higher temperatures, probably
due to the loss of some hydrogen bonds and a decrease of the hydration
of the ions that resulted in an increase of hydrophobicity and favored
the formation of micelles. The higher CMC obtained for the neutral
hexylbiguanide at 60 °C can be due to the disruption of the network
formed by the water molecules surrounding the smaller hexyl chain,
disfavoring the formation of the micelles.25

Finally, the CMC values decreased, whereas the alkyl chain
length
increased. As a result of the increased hydrophobicity of the surfactant,
the micelles started to form at 2.3 mM for the hexyl chain and decreased
to 0.22 mM for the dodecyl chain in neutral conditions.

Suzuki–Miyaura
Coupling Performed in Micellar Conditions
with 1
We previously showed the efficiency of
a 1:1 metformin/Pd(OAc)2 complex in the Suzuki–Miyaura
cross-coupling reaction (Figure 7) in water. The catalytic species were preformed for
15 min at 100 °C, prior to the addition of the substrates. The
coupling product was obtained in 95% yield after 15 min at 100 °C
in pure water,21 and we were able to recycle
the system up to four catalytic runs with no significant loss of efficiency,
after which the catalytic species started to degrade.

Figure 7 Previous results in the
Suzuki–Miyaura coupling using metformin
hydrochloride as a ligand.21

As our group also showed that the hydrophobic environment
created
by micelles can be used as a microreactor in the Suzuki–Miyaura
reaction,13a we decided to use 1 as a metallosurfactant precursor in micellar conditions. Hexylbiguanide 1 was the only alkylbiguanide soluble in basic conditions
and self-assembling in micelles.

The coupling reactions were
performed over 24 h at 0.5 mol % Pd(OAc)2 and 5 mol % 1, at different temperatures (room
temperature, 50, and 100 °C) and concentrations (0.5 and 5 mM)
(Table 2). After 24
h, none of the reaction conditions allowed us to obtain satisfying
results in terms of yield. We were expecting complete conversion at
least for the reaction performed at 100 °C because this was obtained
with the metformin ligand after only 15 min. The very low reactivity
of hexylbiguanide could be explained by a possible segregation between
the substrates and the catalyst. To explain these unexpected results,
we studied the size and the shape of the aggregates formed by neutral 1 under the reaction conditions.

b In 100 mL distilled water.

c In 10 mL distilled water.

d Determined by 1H NMR.

The size and the shape of the micelles were determined
by transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) on a FEI Tecnai T12 (Eindhoven, The Netherlands)
transmission electron microscope equipped with a LaB6 filament and
operated at an acceleration voltage of 120 kV. Samples were prepared
for TEM using a conventional negative staining procedure. A 3 μL
drop of surfactant was adsorbed for 2 min onto a glow-discharged carbon-coated
copper grid and stained for 1 min with freshly prepared 2% uranyl
acetate in D2O. The TEM analysis of a 10 mM solution of 1 showed the formation of two populations of spherical micelles:
one with 50 nm diameter and the other with 200 nm diameter (Figure 8a). After addition
of Pd(OAc)2 to the micellar solution of 1 in
the Suzuki–Miyaura coupling conditions, the formation of undefined
aggregates was observed by TEM (Figure 8b). The micellar structure was probably lost due to
the aggregation of several biguanides around a palladium center that
resulted in the formation of nondefined domains and was responsible
for the total lack of catalytic activity of the system.

Figure 8 TEM analysis
of (a) surfactant 1 at 10 mM in basic
conditions (K2CO3 22 M) and (b) surfactant 1 at 10 mM in basic conditions (K2CO3 22 M)with 0.5 mol % Pd(OAc)2.

As the Pd/hexylbiguanide ratio (Table 3) seemed very important for the aggregation
process, we decided to screen different ratios and study its influence
on the catalytic activity of the system (Table 3). At a 1:2 Pd/hexylbiguanide ratio, higher
yields were obtained, but the results were not reproducible (Table 3, entry 1). At a 1:1
ratio, complete conversion was obtained after 15 min with 0.5 mol
% Pd(OAc)2 and 0.5 mol % 1 (1 mM), at 100
°C (Table 3, entry
2). The TEM analysis of the 1:1 Pd/hexylbiguanide ratio at 1 mM confirmed
the formation of spherical micellar aggregates (Figure 9).

acid, 1.1 mmol (0.152 g) K2CO3, in distilled
water, at 100 °C, in air.

The substrate scope of the reaction performed with metformin as
the catalyst showed limitations in the case of aryl iodides and electron-donating
substituents on the aryl halides.21 We
selected and tested these substrates in the micellar conditions with
0.5 mol % hexylbiguanide (1 mM) and 0.5 mol % Pd(OAc)2 during
15 min, at 100 °C (Table 4). Significantly higher yields were obtained for all of the
substrates tested, especially for 4-iodoanisole and 4-iodoaniline
(Table 4, entries 4
and 5) and 2-bromonaphtalene (Table 4, entry 6).

b At 1 mM.

The recyclability of the micellar
system was studied under the
same conditions and compared with that of the metformin catalyst (Figure 10). In the micellar
system of hexylbiguanide 1, the palladium was kept active
longer and the system was recycled up to six catalytic runs with no
significant loss of activity. Therefore, the hydrophobic environment
of the micelles not only allowed a better solubilization of the substrates
and increased the reaction rates but also prevented palladium oxidation
by water.

Conclusions
We
synthesized and fully characterized a new family of surfactants
containing biguanide and biguanidium hydrophilic groups. All of the
alkylbiguanidium chlorides in the solid state were double protonated
and formed alternating layers of hydrophobic alkyl chains and hydrophilic
biguanidium/chloride. Having determined the CMCs of each surfactant
in neutral and basic conditions when it was possible, we performed
the Suzuki–Miyaura reaction in micellar conditions in water,
using 1 as the surfactant. We showed the importance of
the Pd/hexylbiguanide ratio to obtain an efficient and recyclable
catalytic system for the Suzuki–Miyaura reaction. Different
aggregation states with and without Pd were observed by TEM, and we
showed that a 1:1 Pd/hexylbiguanide ratio is necessary to maintain
the micellar conditions and obtain a reproducible and efficient catalytic
system.
