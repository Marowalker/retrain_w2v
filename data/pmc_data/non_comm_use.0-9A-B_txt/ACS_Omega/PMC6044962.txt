In
this study, two kinds of novel carbazole-based ethynylpyridine
salts: 3,6-bis[2-(1-methylpyridinium)ethynyl]-9-pentyl-carbazole diiodide
(BMEPC) and 3,6-bis[2-(1-methylpyridinium)ethynyl]-9-methyl-carbazole
diiodide (BMEMC) have been employed as photosensitizers owing to their
excellent antibacterial activity. These molecules possess symmetric
A−π–D−π–A-type structures,
which would bring in the unique optical properties. The inhibition
zone measurement of a gradient concentration from 0 to 100 μM
showed BMEPC and BMEMC photoinduced antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli. Diameters of zone of inhibition
were up to 15 and 14 mm under laser irradiations. Under the exposure
of the laser of 442 nm with a power density of 20 mW/cm2, the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of BMEPC on E. coli were between 3.5 and 6.9 μM and that
of BMEMC were between 9.4 and 18.8 μM, respectively. In the
dark experiments as a control, the MIC value is between 6.9 and 13.8
μM for BMEPC, whereas it is between 187.5 and 225.0 μM
for BMEMC. By the comparison of the MIC values of BMEPC and BMEMC
with laser irradiation and in dark, the laser-induced toxicity on
bacteria is more evident, though both of the derivatives have dark
toxicity. With the laser irradiation duration of 30 s and 10 min for
BMEPC and BMEMC, respectively, the survival rate of E. coli approximates zero. An antibacterial mechanism
has been proposed based on the electron paramagnetic resonance characterization,
which indicates that a nitride radical is generated under laser irradiation.
The carbazole-based ethynylpyridine photosensitizers would provide
high potential for further applications in photodynamic therapy.

1 Introduction
In
recent years, the excessive use of antibiotics has caused the
spread of multiresistant bacterial strains as one of the most threatening
issues.1,2 Therefore, the research for new approaches
that can kill bacteria without inducing the appearance of undesired
drug-resistant strains is imperative. Antimicrobial photodynamic therapy
(PDT)3 is a new promising strategy to kill
bacteria including Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Gram-negative
bacteria such as Escherichia coli (E.
coli) have an impermeable outer cell membrane that contains endotoxins
and serves as a shelter, blocking antibiotics and drugs and protecting
the sensitive inner membrane and cell wall.4,5 PDT
has advantages over conventional antibiotic therapy because it eradicates
bacteria by producing free radicals in the presence of a photosensitizer
and the irradiation of visible light or laser will not induce drug
resistance.4

It is worth noting that
the PDT process requires the penetration
of photosensitizers into the cell walls of bacteria and finally the
cytoplasm.6,7 However, the outer membrane barrier of Gram-negative
bacteria can effectively prevent the uptake of anionic and neutral
photosensitizers. Therefore, Gram-negative bacteria are far more difficult
to be inactivated by PDT.8 To solve this
problem, one way is to involve hydrophobic interaction by engineering
the photosensitizers with hydrophobic segments.9 Another effective way is to employ some cationic photosensitizers.10 A pronounced cationic charge induced by a macromolecule
with a large alkyl chain can bind to negatively-charged bacteria and
alter the permeability of the outer membrane.11 In the past decades, multiple kinds of photosensitizers including
phthalocyanines,12 chlorins,13 porphyrins,14 chlorophyll,15 and bacteriochlorophyll16 have displayed a fairly appreciable antimicrobial activity as photodynamic
agents in the presence of oxygen because these derivatives generate
potent oxygen species with suitable wavelengths.

Furthermore,
photosensitizers are expected to have low dark toxicity
and absorption in the optical window (600–900 nm) for light
penetration through tissues to achieve ideal antibacterial PDT performance.
Besides, antibacterial photosensitizers should be able to kill multiple
microbial cells at a relatively low intensity of light, which indicates
that photosensitizers should have a relatively large photon absorption
cross section. Compared to the reported photosensitizers, carbazole
motif is a more naturally occurring heterocycle. It has attracted
increasing attention in the modifications of natural compounds and
synthesis of new derivatives.17 The carbazole
compound families have been known to have multifunctions including
anticancer, antibacterial, anti-HIV, and anti-inflammatory properties.18 Their affinity toward DNA19 enables drugs more easily to bind with bacterial DNA and
display their potency against bacteria. Previously reported carbazole-based
compounds are primarily used to characterize the interaction with
DNA in vitro, whereas the carbazole scaffold in this study further
focuses on the antibacterial activity of such kind of compounds in
vivo. Carbazole scaffolds are one of the most important organic molecular
skeletons for optical functional molecule design.20−22 On one side,
compared to the reported photosensitizers, carbazole-based derivatives,
as an organic chromophore, have a large conjugate system that exhibits
a large absorption cross section and contributes to large intramolecular
electron transfer17 and thus helps stabilize
the formed cation. On the other side, according to the literature,
carbazole derivatives have high binding affinity. Cations formed by
carbazole-based derivatives have high photochemical stability,23 unique biologically activity,24 and photoelectronic25 properties,
which are expected to display effective inhibition on Gram-negative
bacteria.

In this study, we have employed two kinds of novel
carbazole-based
ethynylpyridine salts: 3,6-bis[2-(1-methylpyridinium)ethynyl]-9-pentyl-carbazole
diiodide (BMEPC) and 3,6-bis[2-(1-methylpyridinium)ethynyl]-9-methyl-carbazole
diiodide (BMEMC) in antibacterial application (Figure 1a). The chemical structures are shown in Figure 1b, which have been
reported in our previous work.26 The advantages
of symmetric A−π–D−π–A-type
structures, different affinities, and water solubility result in the
unique biological activity and optical properties. Inhibition zone
test and the antibacterial activity of BMEPC and BMEMC photoinduced
antibacterial activity against E. coli under laser irradiation of 442 nm have been investigated. The minimum
inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of BMEPC and BMEMC on E. coli have been characterized, respectively. The
MIC of BMEPC on E. coli was achieved
between 3.5 and 6.9 μM, which is effective in inhibiting the
growth of E. coli. An antibacterial
mechanism is proposed based on the electron paramagnetic resonance
(EPR) characterization. This study would provide high potential for
the carbazole-based ethynylpyridine molecules to be applied as photosensitizers
in PDT.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 UV–Vis Absorption and Fluorescence
Spectra
The normalized one-photon absorption and fluorescence
spectra of BMEPC and BMEMC in water are shown in Figure 2. The absorption spectra of
BMEPC and BMEMC are extremely similar but different in absorbance
intensity. There are two obvious absorption peaks, where the absorption
peak around 330 nm is corresponding to the π–π*
electron transfer and the absorption peak around 420 nm is due to
the intramolecular charge transfer from the ground state to excited
state. The fluorescence emission spectra were measured with an excitation
wavelength of 425 nm for BMEPC and BMEMC in phosphate-buffered saline
(PBS) solution. Figure 2 shows that the compounds exhibit fluorescence emission peaks at
576 and 592 nm for BMEPC and BMEMC, respectively. The fluorescence
quantum yield was calculated using fluorescein in 0.1 N aqueous NaOH
solution (Φ = 0.9) as a reference standard.16 The quantum yields of BMEPC and BMEMC in PBS buffer solution
were measured to be 2.0 × 10–4 and 6.0 ×
10–5, respectively. It is so weak because of the
effect of a heavy atom and fluorescence quenching caused by intramolecular
D–A electron transfer.27,28

2.2 Zone of Inhibition Measurement
Inhibitory
zone characterization is an effective way to visualize the antibacterial
activity directly. The inhibitory zone was determined by different
concentrations of photosensitizers ranging from 6.3, 12.5, and 25
to 40, 60, 80, and 100 (mg/mL) against E. coli. Large inhibition zone was observed around BMEPC and BMEMC samples
either in dark or under laser irradiation of 442 nm (Figure 3a,b), whereas no inhibition
zone was seen around the hole without BMEPC and BMEMC (not circled
area in Figure 3a,b).
It was revealed that all of the BMEPC and BMEMC samples with the total
concentration range showed antibacterial effect. Results of statistical
analysis showed that the mean diameters of inhibitory zone formed
around BMEPC and BMEMC samples were significantly different (P < 0.05) (Figure 3c,d). Under the same concentration, both BMEPC and BMEMC exhibit
an improved antibacterial property with light compared to the group
in dark. Compared with BMEMC, the data of BMEPC in dark are lower
but in reverse in dark. These comparisons indicate the crucial effect
of irradiation on the inhibition of bacteria. Also, BMEPC has a larger
diameter of inhibition zone than BMEMC in light, as can be explained
by different lengths of alkyl chain they carried. With a longer chain
of alkyl, BMEPC displays a strong hydrophobic property, which enables
a highly enhanced affinity to the lipid layer of microbial cells.29 Note that even in dark, BMEMC displayed antibacterial
activity, which may also account for the electrostatic interaction
between the ionic bacterial membrane and the cationic photosensitizer.
According to Quang et al.,30 inhibitory
zone measurements proved that BMEPC and BMEMC were effective against
Gram-negative E. coli.

of photosensitizers BMEPC and BMEMC against E. coli (a) in dark & (b) under irradiation of
laser of 442 nm inhibition after 24 h incubation at 37 °C. The
statistical analysis shows the diameter of prohibition zone as a function
of the concentration of BMEPC and BMEMC in dark (c) and with light
(d).

2.3 Antimicrobial
Properties
We have
carried out the MIC characterization to determine the MIC. Under the
laser irradiation with a power density of 20 mW/cm2, the
MIC value of BMEPC falls in the interval of 3.5 and 6.9 μM,
whereas that of BMEMC is between 9.4 and 18.8 μM (Figure S2a,c). In dark, the MIC value interval
for BMEPC is from 6.9 to 13.8 and that for BMEMC is from 187.5 to
225.0 μM (Figure S1b,d). All of the
concentrations are referred to the final effective concentration.
The MIC value with a laser of 442 nm irradiation is much lower than
that in dark, which indicates that the antibacterial activity is much
stronger with laser irradiation. This photodynamic toxicity may be
caused by the free radicals generated with laser. In addition, the
compounds also display appreciable toxicity in dark, which can be
explained by the electrostatic interaction between the microbial cell
membrane and the photosensitizers.10,31 According
to Zhang et al.,32 carbazole derivatives
can permeate the membrane of E. coli cells and accumulate inside. We have performed an experiment by
confocal scanning laser microscopy (CSLM) to study the viability membrane
disruption of E. coli bacteria treated
with BMEPC and BMEMC (Figure S2). Furthermore,
propidium iodide (PI) was used to identify the dead bacteria. The
result indicates that the carbazole derivatives BMEPC and BMEMC can
penetrate the membrane of E. coli and
accumulate inside. The images stained by PI verified the antibacterial
activity by carbazole derivatives BMEPC and BMEMC. Compared with the
previously reported photosensitizers,33,34 the MIC value
of BMEPC is relatively lower under irradiation, indicating a more
prominent effect on bacterial inhibition. These results suggest that
photoinduced active species are the dominant factors to kill bacteria.

2.4 Photoinduced Bacterial Inactivation
The
antibacterial activities of BMEPC & BMEMC have been evaluated
by 442 nm laser-induced disinfection of E. coli. The number of E. coli cells remains
almost unchanged in control experiments without photosensitizers (Figure S3a), indicating the negligible effect
of the visible light to the bacterial cells. Figure 4 shows the colonies of E.
coli inoculated on the agar plate and indicates that
the survival rate varied as the time of interaction between E. coli and BMEPC and BMEMC varied, corresponding
to the value in Table S1. It is illustrated
that the growth of E. coli on the plate
reflects the survival rate of E. coli after interacting with reagents after a certain time interval.

Figure 4 Photos
of agar plates with the initial concentration of E.
coli and after being treated with BMEPC and BMEMC
under irradiation of a 442 nm laser for different times.

For BMEPC, it shows a very strong antibacterial
ability after 30
s laser irradiation. For BMEMC, the antibacterial rate could achieve
95% after 30 s laser irradiation. When the laser irradiation was extended
for about 10 min, all E. coli cells
are killed. These results suggest that both BMEPC and BMEMC have strong
photoinduced toxicity against bacteria. Note that the BMEPC photosensitizer
exhibits a stronger antibacterial capability than BMEMC because of
the higher affinity of the longer alkyl chain to the cellular structure,29 in accordance with the former results. As shown
in the Figure S3a, the agar plate was covered
with colonies when the E. coli suspension
was irradiated by laser even for 25 min. However, compared with the
results shown in Figure 4, there were fewer colonies of 105 cfu/mL E. coli suspension with BMEPC or BMEMC inoculated
on the agar plates across certain time intervals for 442 nm laser
irradiation, which can indicate the successful inhibition of the growth
of E. coli. Compared with the result
in dark (Figure S3b and Table S2), the inhibitory efficiency is obviously higher under
laser irradiation of 442 nm with a relatively lower E. coli survival rate in a shorter time interval.
Although it has less bactericidal effect in dark in a relatively short
time compared to the group with laser irradiation, a prominent effect
was observed after the irradiation time is extended to 25 min, which
reflects the crucial role of laser irradiation in bacterial inactivation.

2.5 EPR Measurement
The experimental
results prompt us to figure out the PDT mechanism. We use EPR characterization
to detect the free radicals with 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide (DMPO) as the spin-trapping agent. Both BMEMC and
BMEPC yield a similar spectrum under irradiation of a mercury lamp
(Figure 5a,b). BMEMC
alone and BMEMC with E. coli dissolved
in PBS solution were exposed to the irradiation of the mercury lamp,
yielding a similar signal (Figure 5a,c), which is in consistence with the previous report
of nitride radicals in the literature.35 There is barely no signal for BMEPC with the E. coli suspension (Figure 5d), though, there is a strong signal under irradiation for BMEPC
alone (Figure 5b).
A reasonable assumption could be that the nitride radicals generated
under irradiation have been consumed completely by E. coli. We fitted the EPR spectra by spin-fitting
function in Xepr software (Bruker) considering carbon, nitride, and
hydroxyl radicals, as shown in Figure S4, which is in good agreement with the experimental result. From the
fitted spectra, we can get the integral area of three kinds of radicals,
which is in proportion to the percentage of the total. However, there
is a difference of the percentage of different radicals between BMEMC
with and without E. coli, calculated
from the integral area of the spectrum, as listed in Table 1. The percentage of the respective
radical is an important indicator that reflects a far more remarkable
bacterial inactivation ability. From Table 1, we find that the signal of the nitride
radical for BMEMC with E. coli is much
smaller than that without E. coli,
whereas there is no signal for BMEPC with E. coli. Therefore, it indicates that BMEPC and BMEMC under the light irradiation
can form an N-centered nitride ionic radical, which can interact with
the negative Gram bacteria E. coli and
further inactivate E. coli (Figure 6). Thus, it is reasonable
that the nitride ionic radical was consumed and the intensity of the
peak related to the nitride radical decreased, which is in good agreement
with the experimental result. The understanding of the mechanism would
be helpful in prompting the application of carbazole-based molecules
in PDT.

3 Conclusions
In summary, the carbazole-based photosensitizers
display excellent
antibacterial capability under the laser irradiation of 442 nm. In
the inhibition zone test, the diameters of zone of inhibition for
Gram-negative bacteria with laser irradiation were up to 15 and 14
mm compared to 12.5 and 15 mm for BMEPC and BMEMC, respectively, indicating
the antibacterial activity. The MIC value intervals of BMEPC and BMEMC
on E. coli were 2.8–3.5 and
9.4–18.7 μM, respectively, under laser irradiation. In
dark control experiments, the MIC value intervals of BMEPC and BMEMC
were 3.5–6.9 and 112.5–131.3 μM, respectively.
For BMEMC, with the laser irradiation within 10 min, almost no E. coli cells can survive. For BMEPC, E. coli was inhibited after 30 s irradiation. The
improved photoinduced antibacterial activities are mainly attributed
to strong one-photon absorption and cationic radicals formed under
the laser irradiation. The photoinduced nitride radicals and the consumption
in the interaction with E. coli are
detected by EPR spectroscopy under laser irradiation of 442 nm, which
is effective to kill Gram-negative bacteria. Compared with the previously
reported photosensitizers, BMEPC and BMEMC can be photoactivated in
a broader wavelength range according to the UV–vis absorption
spectrum and exhibits an enhanced biocompatibility. These results
indicate that BMEPC and BMEMC as the typical carbazole-based photosensitizers
are potential antibacterial agents that can be used for disinfection
and PDT.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials
Sodium chloride, disodium
hydrogen phosphate, potassium chloride, and potassium phosphate were
obtained from AMRESCO Company. Resazurin was obtained from Shanghai
MaiKun Chemical Industry Co., Ltd. Nutrient Broth was obtained from
Beijing HongHu Combined Chemical Products Co., Ltd. Agarose was obtained
from Biowest Reagents Company.

4.2 Preparation
of the E. coli Suspension
E. coli was prepared
by the Laboratory of Controllable Preparation and Application of Nanomaterials.
The strains of E. coli was inoculated
to 15 mL of Luria Bertani broth as a nutrient source and incubated
at 37 °C with a 100 rpm shaking rate overnight. Then,
the E. coli was gently cooled and stored
at 4 °C before use. The concentration of E. coli suspension was estimated by counting the clone on the coating plate.
For MIC and photoinduced bacterial inactivation experiments, the concentration
of E. coli suspension was diluted to
105 cfu/mL with PBS solution.

4.3 Measurements
1H NMR spectra
were recorded on a Varian Gemini-300/Bruker AV 400 spectrometer using
DMSO-d6 as a solvent, and all shifts are
referred to tetramethylsilane. The chemical shift (s = singlet, d
= doublet, t = triplet, and m = multiplet) is shown in Figure S5. The high-resolution electrospray ionization
mass spectrometry (HR-ESI MS) spectra have been verified in our previous
study.26 Both 1H NMR and HR-ESI
MS measurements have successfully verified the molecule structures.
The UV–vis absorption and fluorescence emission spectra of
BMEPC and BMEMC were recorded on a Shimadzu UV-2500 spectrophotometer
and a Hitachi FL-4500 spectrophotometer, respectively. According to
the absorption spectra, we choose a continuous-wave He–Cd laser
system (IK57511-G, Kimmon, 442 nm) for experimental investigation.
CSLM (Nikon, A1R MP) is used to study the viability membrane disruption
of E. coli bacteria treated with BMEPC
and BMEMC. EPR spectra were recorded by an EPR spectrometer (Bruker
E500) with a mercury lamp. The solution of BMEPC and BMEMC in PBS
for the measurement is 100 μL with the concentration of 1.5
mM. For E. coli suspension alone, 1
μL of 105 cfu/mL E. coli suspension was added to 100 μL of PBS solution. For BMEPC
solution with the E. coli suspension,
1 μL of 105 cfu/mL E. coli suspension was added to 100 μL of BMEPC solution. For BMEMC
solution with the E. coli suspension,
1 μL of 105 cfu/mL E. coli suspension was added to 100 μL of BMEMC solution. The same
preparation method is applied for BMEPC. DMPO (20 μL) as a spin-trap
reagent was added into the above solutions. EPR spectra were collected
with a microwave frequency of 9.75 GHz and a modulation frequency
of 150 Hz at room temperature. Samples were loaded in 0.6 mm inner
diameter quartz capillary tubes in an N2 atmosphere for
10 min to get rid of oxygen and exposed to irradiation from a mercury
lamp (λ > 400 nm). All of the measurements were carried out
in room temperature.

4.4 Zone of Inhibition Measurement
First,
we prepared molten agar (50 °C) and inoculated E. coli (1010 cfu/mL) into the prepared
agar. Then, we poured the molten agar (50 °C) into sterilized
Petri dishes and allowed them to solidify. The solid agar was completely
inoculated with bacteria (108 cfu/mL). Once the agar had
been aseptically dried, seven 6 mm wells were punched into the agar
with a sterile Pasteur pipette. Ten microliters of varied concentrations
was placed in the wells over solidified agar gel.36 The plates were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. Finally,
the diameter of the growth inhibition zones around the well was measured
by a digital caliper. All measurements were conducted in triplicate.

4.5 Photoinduced Bacterial Inactivation
To
determine the activity of the photosensitizers on bacterial inactivation,
the survival rate of E. coli was determined
by using the ratio of Nt/N0, where N0 is the initial number of cfu and Nt is that at different time intervals. The time intervals
were set to be 0 s, 30 s, 5, 10, and 25 min. For each time interval,
100 μL of the suspension was injected to the surface of the
solid agar in 60 mm × 15 mm Petri dishes. The plates were then
incubated in a 37 °C incubator for 24 h.

4.6 Study
on the Minimum Inhibition Concentration
The MIC of the compound
was determined using the resazurin dye
reduction assay. The blue resazurin was changed to resorufin by microbial
cells inside oxidoreductase. The blue color of the dye indicates the
dead microbial cells, whereas the pink color indicates the activity
of viable cells.37 We added the sample
compounds (BMEPC/BMEMC) to inhibit reproduction of cells during incubation
(Figure S1). The antibacterial activity
of the compounds can be evaluated by the color of the dye in wells.
Dye remaining blue or purple indicates that microbial cells have been
successfully inhibited. The pink color conversion indicates the viability
of microbial cells. The least dilution of compounds that prevents
dye turning pink can be taken as the MIC value for the corresponding
compound. The synthesized compound was subjected to MIC studies against E. coli and the MIC values are given.
