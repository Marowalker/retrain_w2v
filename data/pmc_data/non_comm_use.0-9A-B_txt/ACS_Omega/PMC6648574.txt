The
exploration of simultaneous removal of co-existing or multiple
pollutants from water by the means of nanomaterials paves a new avenue
that is free from secondary pollution and inexpensive. In the aquatic
environment, river water contains a mixture of ions, which can influence
the adsorption process. In this respect, removing heavy metal ions
becomes a true challenge. Here, four heavy metal ions, namely, Pb2+, Cd2+, Cu2+, and Ni2+,
have been successfully removed simultaneously from river water using
ultrafine mesoporous magnetite (Fe3O4) nanoparticles
(UFMNPs) based on the affinity of these metal ions toward the UFMNP
surfaces as well as their unique mesoporous structure, promoting the
easy adsorption. The individual removal efficiencies of Pb2+, Cd2+, Cu2+, and Ni2+ ions from
river water were 98, 87, 90, and 78%, respectively, whereas the removal
efficiencies of the mixed Pb2+, Cd2+, Cu2+, and Ni2+ ions were 86, 80, 84, and 54%, respectively,
in the same river water. Thus, the data clearly indicate the complex
removal of heavy metal ions in multi-ion systems. This study has demonstrated
the huge potential of UFMNPs to be effective for their use in wastewater
treatment, especially to simultaneously remove multiple heavy metal
ions from aqueous media.

==== Body
Introduction
Heavy metal ions (HMIs)
are ubiquitous pollutants in the environment,
and in particular, the existence of HMIs such as Pb2+,
Cd2+, Cu2+, and Ni2+ in river water
is of great concern because of their severe threats to public health,
living organisms, and freshwater supply.1,2 For instance,
the exposure to the excessive levels of such HMIs significantly increases
the likelihood of kidney damage, nervous system damage, and renal
dysfunction as they are nonbiodegradable.3,4 To
eliminate these potential harmful health effects, environmental regulations
to reduce the HMIs concentration in water are becoming increasingly
stringent.5 Simultaneous removal of a mixture
of several hazardous HMIs offers a cost-effective solution. It has
been, however, quite challenging to date due to the competing adsorption
of these HMIs. Meanwhile, it is highly requested so as to avoid the
repeated one-by-one removal of pollutants and of course to develop
an attractive low-cost strategy.

To achieve the removal of HMIs
from different effluents, conventional
methods including chemical precipitation, membrane filtration, and
adsorption have been developed.6 Of all
of the various treatment technologies, adsorption is one of the techniques
generally used due to its cost-effectiveness and flexibility in design
and operation.3,7,8 In
this way, numerous adsorbents have been developed and used for the
removal of pollutants from water/wastewater including activated carbon,
zeolite, polymeric materials, fly ash, and biomass.7,9 Although
they may be effective for HMI removal, they have many disadvantages
including complexity, high cost, and secondary waste and have low
adsorption capacities, which limit their use in water/wastewater treatment.
Hence, there is a need to design and explore new adsorbents with improvements
in adsorption capacity, superior separation rate, and ease of operation.

Magnetic nanoparticles (NPs) with particle sizes less than 40 nm
are easily dispersible in solutions, exhibiting a large surface area
and superparamagnetic properties, and can be attracted by an externally
applied magnetic field but do not retain magnetic properties when
the field is removed.10 This magnetic property
makes them effective adsorbents for HMI removal and highly useful
in novel separation processes. In particular, more recently, magnetite
(Fe3O4) NPs have been found to be great adsorbents
for water purification as they are recognized to exhibit high ratio
of area to volume and fast magnetic response and adsorption kinetics.11 Additionally, magnetite nanoparticles are nontoxic,
recyclable, and easy to synthesize, and co-precipitation method is
a simple and efficient way to produce them.2 For these reasons, monodisperse magnetite NPs were used to remove
arsenic from water with magnetic capture at an extremely low magnetic
field gradient.12 The reduction of the
size of Fe3O4 NPs from 300 to 12 nm also increased
by orders of magnitude the removal efficiency of As(V) and orange
II from solution.12 Besides, magnetite
NPs with small sizes have been synthesized and used for removal of
heavy metal ions such as Tc(VII) and Cr(VI),13 As(III),6 Hg(II),14 and As(V)15 from aqueous solutions.
These studies have been carried out to date on the single adsorption
of heavy metal ions onto bare Fe3O4 NPs.3,7,16 As such, the aim of this study
is to investigate the single and multicomponent adsorption of Pb2+, Cd2+, Cu2+, and Ni2+ ions
from natural water using pristine Fe3O4 NPs
since information about simultaneous adsorption of HMIs in multicomponent
systems on bare Fe3O4 NPs is scare so far and
should be explored. The natural water was used because it contains
multiple types of these metal ions and its environment is complicated.

Herein, ultrafine magnetite NPs were synthesized by co-precipitation
method and successfully used as adsorbents for the removal of four
mixed metal ions (Pb2+, Cd2+, Cu2+, and Ni2+) from contaminated river water, which represents
hitherto the greatest application in removal of metal ions by magnetite
NPs. The key to this success was based on the mesoporous property
exhibited by the magnetite NPs, which, to the best of our knowledge,
has not never explored to date. Indeed, river water was used because
groundwater and surface water contain a complex mixture of ions and
organic matters, which mimics well a concrete practical application.
The important factors including medium pH, temperature, contact time,
adsorbent amount, and initial metal ion concentration as well as thermodynamic
parameters were investigated. Also, the easy regeneration of the magnetite
nanoadsorbents was carried out using diluted nitric acid at pH 1.

Results
and Discussion
Characterization of the Ultrafine Magnetite
Nanoparticles
The powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern
of Fe3O4 is shown in Figure 1a. All of the diffraction peaks with 2θ
at 30.15, 35.37,
43.31, 53.69, 57.08, 62.77, 71.48, and 74.34° are attributed
to crystal planes of Fe3O4(220), (311), (400),
(422), (511), (440), (620), and (533), respectively. Therefore, the
XRD results confirm the successful synthesis of Fe3O4 NPs and show good consistency with the standard pattern of
Fe3O4 (PDF card 19-0629). Moreover, no other
significant peaks were observed. This observation indicates that the
synthesized Fe3O4 NPs do not contain any other
crystallite impurities. The calculated average crystallite size was
9 nm, which indicates that ultrafine Fe3O4 NPs
were formed17 using Debye Scherrer equation
based on the line-broadening of the magnetite (311) reflection and
expressed by16 1  where
δ is the full width at half-maximum
(FWHM) in radian, α is Bragg’s angle, λ is the
wavelength of the incident X-rays, p is a constant
(0.9), and D is the diameter.

the prepared magnetite nanoparticles. (a)
Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern, (b) transmission electron
microscopy (TEM) image, (c) N2 adsorption–desorption
isotherms, and (d) average pore size of Fe3O4 nanoparticles.

Details about the structure
and morphology of the Fe3O4 NPs were examined
with TEM (Figure 1b).
Through visual observation, we found
that the small spherical particles tend to aggregate due to the magnetic
forces between them. This tendency of ultrafine mesoporous magnetite
(Fe3O4) nanoparticles (UFMNPs) to aggregate
was attributed to the absence of stabilizing surfactants deliberately
omitted during their synthesis to ensure that UFMNPs surface sites
remain exposed and active for better characterizing the adsorption
of the different studied metal ions. The average size of the particles
is estimated to vary between 4 and 17 nm. Thus, the smaller magnetite
NPs exhibited a high dispersion capability in water.16,18,19

Figure 1c shows
the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) analysis of the prepared
Fe3O4 NPs, which revealed a relative high surface
area of 94.43 m2 g–1. Physical properties
such as surface area, pore volume, and average pore diameter of Fe3O4 NPs are listed in Table 1. Besides, the nitrogen adsorption/desorption
isotherm of UFMNPs was similar to the type IV isotherms, proving indeed
the presence of mesopores according to the BET classification unlike
previously reported nonporous structures of magnetite.20,21 This mesoporous structure displayed thus effective transport pathways
to the interior cavities, which could further increase the adsorption
capacity of UFMNPs.22 The formation of
the mesoporous Fe3O4 NPs structure is due to
the addition of hydrazine during thermal treatment at 85 °C.23,24 The particles have a spherical form, so the specific surface area
can enable the determination of the average particle diameter by the
following equation25 2  where ∂ is the theoretical
density
in g cm–3, S is the specific surface
area in m2 g–1, and DBET is the average particle diameter in nm.

diameter (nm)	pore size
(nm)	pore volume (cm3 g–1 Å–1)	
Fe3O4	94.43	15	2–60	0.02–0.35	
Consequently,
the average particle size of 17.41 nm was evaluated,
consistent with the TEM results. Figure 1d indicates the pore size in the range of
2–60 nm, and the average diameter was around 15 nm shown by
the strong peak.

Performances of Ultrafine Magnetite Nanoparticles
in Deionized
Water and Natural Water
Figure 2 depicts the application of UFMNPs in contaminated
deionized water and natural water for the removal of Pb2+, Cd2+, Cu2+, and Ni2+ ions at ambient
temperature. In this regard, the removal of these metal ions from
deionized water shows a rapid adsorption of Pb2+, Cd2+, and Cu2+ where more than 90% was adsorbed within
20 and 40 min for Ni2+. Over this period, the rate of the
metal ion uptake slowly decreased and gradually did not seem to increase
any further (Figure 2a). These observations can be explained by the fact that at the beginning
of the adsorption process there was more availability of active sites
on the Fe3O4 NP adsorbents, and with the accumulation
time, these sites slowly saturated.26 Thus,
the removal efficiencies of Pb2+, Cd2+, Cu2+, and Ni2+ ions were 99.6, 99.1, 99.2, and 98.3%,
respectively. The same trend was observed with the individual removal
of the studied HMIs in the river water (Figure 2b) but with longer removal time and less
removal efficiency during both steps described above. Actually, the
first step lasted 100 min for Pb2+, Cd2+, and
Cu2+ where 97.60, 86.60, and 89.51% were adsorbed, respectively.
For Ni2+ ions, it needed 120 min and its removal efficiency
was 77.50%. Then, the uptake slowed down for all of the metal ions
and did not increase any further over time. The uptake of these metal
ions was retarded and decreased in the river water by the presence
of other substances including ions and organic matters, which likely
blurred the adsorption of the metal ions and filled up the pores on
the Fe3O4 NP adsorbents.

magnetite nanoparticles in different types
of water. Individual removal of Pb2+, Cu2+,

water and (b) river water. (c) Simultaneous removal of Pb2+, Cu2+, Cd2+, and Ni2+ ions from
river water. (d) Number of succeeding cycles using diluted nitric
acid at pH 1.0. (For 50 mL of deionized water, initial concentration
of 10 mg L–1, 50 mg of Fe3O4 NPs, initial pH of solution 5.5 were used, and for 50 mL of river
water, initial concentration of 50 mg L–1, 100 mg
of Fe3O4 NPs, initial pH of solution 6.5, and
temperature of 25 °C were used).

To further demonstrate the performance of the UFMNPs, the
simultaneous
removal of these HMIs was carried out in the river water (Figure 2c). Upon comparing
the removal efficiency of the previous individual removals, it was
clear that the uptake of the studied HMIs was further decreased in
simultaneous removal, even though both steps were also observed. This
was assigned to the competitive adsorption of these HMIs at a time
that hindered the uptake process, indicating that the adsorption of
the metal ions depended on each other. In addition, the reduced equilibrium
capacity values of metal ions adsorbed onto Fe3O4 adsorbents clearly demonstrated the competition between heavy metal
ions for the available surface area. Preferential adsorption of heavy
metal ions from the mixture was inherent to the affinity of these
HMIs toward Fe3O4 adsorbents, as determined
from single removal analysis (Table S1).
After 180 min, the removal efficiencies of Pb2+, Cd2+, Cu2+, and Ni2+ ions were 85.62, 80.31,
84.41, and 54.20%, respectively. These results showed additional reasons
to the foregoing findings during the simultaneous uptake, namely,
the electropositivity of the ions,27 hydrated
ionic radii,18 ionic strength of the solution,28 concentration of the metal ions,29 and precipitation and surface complexation.30 Nevertheless, it is noteworthy that the simultaneous
removal of four ions has been achieved even if the removal efficiency
was less than 90% for each ion, and one could attribute the key to
this success of simultaneous removal of these metal ions to the large
ratio of the surface area to volume, mesoporous property, and relative
huge pore volume (0.02–0.35 cm3 g–1 Å–1) of the UFMNPs. Also, we extended the
previous results by the aggregation observed in the TEM image, which
promoted the easy adsorption of the ions via the overlapping of the
adsorption sites of the naked Fe3O4 NP adsorbents.

In the adsorption process, the desorption and repeatability are
significant parameters for developing new adsorbents for practical
applications. The desorption study was carried out to examine the
recyclability and regeneration of the adsorbents in synthetic water.
To do so, the studied heavy metal ions (i.e., Pb2+, Cd2+, Cu2+, and Ni2+) adsorbed by UFMNPs
were released (Scheme 1) using diluted nitric acid (0.01 M) at different pH values such
as pH 1.0, pH 2.0, and pH 3.0, and the results are shown in Figure S4. As can be observed, the pH 1.0 was
more suitable to restore the used adsorbents since the desorption
efficiency decreases with the increasing pH. The reusability of the
UFMNPs was thus tested by successively applying the adsorption/desorption
cycle using the same adsorbents in deionized water using diluted nitric
acid (0.01 M) at pH 1.0. Figure 2d illustrates the removal efficiency of the studied
metal ions in several cycles (five cycles) using Fe3O4 NPs. It is found that the Fe3O4 nanoadsorbents
can retain nearly 85% of their initial adsorption capacity after five
succeeding adsorption/desorption cycles, which confirms their effective
recoverability in diluted nitric acid at pH 1.0.

Metal Ions from Aqueous Medium Following the Desorption
Process

adsorption of metal ions across mesoporous magnetite nanoparticles.

Tests of the Metal Ion Adsorption
To characterize the
dependence of metal ion adsorption on different parameters and their
nature, we performed the adsorption process in synthetic water (for
more parameters, see the Supporting Information, SI).

Effect of pH on Metal Ion Adsorption
In the adsorption
process, the pH of the medium remains a fundamental controlling parameter
that affects the metal chemistry in solution and the actives sites
of the adsorbent.30 To this aim, the influence
of pH on the removal efficiency of heavy metal ions by UFMNPs was
assessed over a wide pH range from 2 to 12 and is shown in Figure 3a. As can be seen
in this figure, the increase in the pH leads to the increase in the
removal efficiency for all tested metal ions until pH = 6, beyond
which the removal efficiency remains almost constant. One reason may
be the fact that at lower pH the proton (H+) density in
the medium is higher, and then, a competition between H+ and metal ions can occur at the active sites of the Fe3O4 nanoadsorbents rendering the active adsorption sites
less available for metal ions.31 As the
adsorption mechanism is a surface process, the surface of the adsorbent
is of great importance for the extent of adsorption and is a key quality
parameter. Therefore, the other reason was ascribed to the surface
charge of the Fe3O4 nanoadsorbents since magnetite
NPs exhibit amphoteric surface activity.18

Figure 3 (a)
Effect of pH on the removal of Cu2+, Cd2+, Ni2+, and Pb2+ ions by Fe3O4 nanoparticles at 25 °C (the initial concentration of
10 mg L–1, pH 5.5). (b) Effect of solution pH on
the ζ-potential of Fe3O4 nanoparticles.

In aqueous media, the surface
of magnetite NPs is recovered by
FeOH. As such, it can be deprotonated or protonated to lead to FeO– or Fe(OH)2+ according to the
pH of the medium. Furthermore, to understand the adsorption of charged
species and the impact of pH, the ζ-potential of the UFMNPs
was recorded at different pH values and is depicted in Figure 3b. As can be seen in this figure,
the potential of zero charge (PZC) of the UFMNPs is 4.5, consistent
with the literature,7 where their total
charge is considered zero as the positive charges and negative charges
are equal. Below pHPZC (4.5), the positive charges are
predominant onto the Fe3O4 NP adsorbents; therefore,
an electrostatic repulsion existed between heavy metal ions and their
surfaces, which illustrates the weak removal efficiency of the different
metal ions at low pH. In contrast, the surface of the UFMNPs becomes
negatively charged (FeO–) beyond pHPZC (4.5), promoting metal ions’ electrostatic attraction. This
explains the increase in the uptake of the different metal ions at
higher pH values. Nevertheless, at some point (pH > 6) it was found
that the removal efficiency decreases with the increasing pH of the
solution because different metal ions began precipitating.7,32 Moreover, at 25 °C, the solubility product constants of Pb(OH)2, Cd(OH)2, Cu(OH)2, and Ni(OH)2 are 1.43 × 10–20, 7.20 × 10–15, 2.00 × 10–15, and 5.48 × 10–16, respectively. It has been found that the removal of heavy metal
ions may occur owing to the formation of hydroxide precipitation at
pH values higher than 6.7,16,33 Hence, the removal of heavy metals at high pH (pH > 6) introduced
uncertainty with respect to adsorption against precipitation.3,34 For this reason, the solution of pH 5.5 was selected throughout
the removal experiments.

To test the stability of the prepared
Fe3O4 NPs, the leaching of iron ions was investigated
during the adsorption
of the different metal ions at different pH values in synthetic water. Table 2 summarizes this leaching
after suspending 50 mg of Fe3O4 NPs in 50 mL
of metal ion solution for 2 h. The results indicated that the leaching
of iron ions was negligible with respect to the total iron even though
the values in more acidic solution (pH 2.0) were the highest ones
for all of the tested metal ions. Consequently, the pH of the medium
did not affect the adsorbents (Fe3O4 NPs).

Adsorption Kinetics
The adsorption
kinetics is one
of the important characteristics defining the effectiveness of an
adsorbent, which describes the solute uptake rate by controlling the
diffusion process and the residence time of an adsorbate uptake at
the solid/solution interface. To evaluate the nature of the adsorption
mechanism and the efficiency of the UFMNPs, two widely used kinetic
models such as the pseudo-first-order and pseudo-second-order kinetic
models were investigated to analyze the experimental results (for
brevity, the relative equations are given in SI). Figure 4 depicts
the linear plot of the mentioned adsorption kinetic models of the
separate and simultaneous process of these heavy metal ions. The results
of the calculated kinetic parameters are listed in Table S2. From this table, the pseudo-second-order model with
its higher correlation coefficient (R2) for all tested metal ions described the adsorption process better
than the pseudo-first-order model using Fe3O4 NPs, showing quite a good linearity (Figure 4b,d). This observation denotes that the adsorption
process was controlled by chemisorption.35 Moreover, the values of calculated equilibrium capacities qe (cal.) resulting from the pseudo-second-order
model were more consistent with experimental q values qe (exp.) than those calculated from the pseudo-first-order
model. However, decreased values of the quantity of heavy metal ions
adsorbed onto Fe3O4 NPs from mixed metal ion
solutions compared to the single ion solution ones markedly illustrated
the competition between the different heavy metal ions for the accessible
active sites on the adsorbents. The results in this quaternary Pb–Cd–Cu–Ni
system indicated that the rate constant of Pb2+ (0.045
g mg–1 min–1) was higher than
the rate constants of Cu2+ (0.008 g mg–1 min–1), Cd2+ (0.005 g mg–1 min–1), and Ni2+ (0.003 g mg–1 min–1), further demonstrating the strong affinity
of Fe3O4 NPs for Pb2+. Additionally,
it significantly showed the inhibition effect of Pb2+ in
the competitive adsorption of multicomponent systems.30

and (b) chemical adsorption (chemisorption) models for single adsorption.
(c) Physical adsorption (physisorption) and (d) chemical adsorption
(chemisorption) models for competitive adsorption.

Effect of Initial Metal Ion Concentration
and Adsorption Isotherms
The initial concentration remains
a fundamental parameter that
allows ascertaining the adsorption capacity of an adsorbent. Figure S7 represents the experimental results
of the influence of initial metal ion (Pb2+, Cd2+, Cu2+, Ni2+) concentrations on the removal
efficiency obtained in the range of 10–150 mg L–1. It is clear that with an increase in metal ion concentrations the
uptake efficiency of all studied metal ions gradually decreased. This
observation can be explained by the fact that at low metal ion concentration
the ratio number of moles of metal ions to the active sites of the
Fe3O4 nanoadsorbents is large and thereby the
fractional adsorption becomes independent of initial metal ion concentration.4 However, when the metal ion concentration increases,
the available active sites on the Fe3O4 nanoadsorbents
become fewer compared with the available number of moles of metal
ions, leading to the decrease in the adsorption efficiency of metal
ions.36

To determine the nature of
the interaction between all tested metal ions and the Fe3O4 nanoadsorbents, and find the maximum capacity of these
nanoadsorbents, the adsorption data were examined using adsorption
isothermal models such as Langmuir, Freundlich, Dubinin–Radushkevich,
and Temkin isotherm models. (See the Supporting Information regarding the assumptions and equations related
to each model.) Figure 5 shows the different isotherm models used for characterizing the
adsorption of Pb2+, Cd2+, Cu2+, and
Ni2+ onto the UFMNPs, and the entire calculated isotherm
parameters from these models are listed in Table S3. From these results, the adsorption of the tested ions is
well described by the Langmuir isotherm model where the correlation
coefficient is closer to unity. This demonstrates that the active
sites onto the Fe3O4 NPs disperse homogeneously
and the adsorbed metal ions cover the NPs surface by forming a monolayer.
Besides, the adsorption can occur only at a fixed number of definite
identical and equivalent localized sites. The adsorption of the tested
metal ions was based on the electrostatic attraction between them
and the Fe3O4 NP surfaces. According to the
Langmuir model results, the maximum adsorption capacities of Pb2+, Cd2+, Cu2+, and Ni2+ onto
the UFMNPs were 85, 79, 83, and 66 mg g–1, respectively.
Also, the RL values of the Langmuir model
for all studied metal ions lied in the range of 0–1, illustrating
favorable adsorption of these metal ions by Fe3O4 NP adsorbents. The adsorption intensity n from
the Freundlich model of the tested metal ions was in the range of
1–10, indicating also a favorable adsorption process.37 Based on the Dubinin–Radushkevich model,
the values of ε (kJ mol–1) for all studied
metal ions were higher than 8, confirming that the attractive forces
were chemical bonding (chemisorption).38 The relatively high values of the Temkin isotherm δT for all studied metal ions demonstrate the strong interaction between
the Fe3O4 NPs and the metal ions.

Conclusions
In
this work, ultrafine Fe3O4 NPs were successfully
synthesized to remove simultaneously four ions (quaternary-metal systems)
including Pb2+, Cd2+, Cu2+, and Ni2+ from contaminated river water thanks to their mesoporous
structure. They were demonstrated as highly effective adsorbents for
the removal of multiple metal ions from artificial water and river
water. The kinetic models of metal ion adsorption onto Fe3O4 NPs fitted perfectly with the pseudo-second-order model
both in single and multicomponent systems, illustrating that the processes
were chemisorptive in nature. The experimental findings well followed
the Langmuir isotherm, indicating that the adsorption mechanism was
limited by monolayer coverage. Furthermore, based on the thermodynamic
investigations, it was also shown that the adsorption process was
spontaneous and endothermic. Eventually, for practical applications,
the adsorption/desorption tests demonstrated that the ultrafine Fe3O4 NPs were reusable and can be used several times
even after five succeeding cycles. The regeneration of Fe3O4 NP adsorbents using diluted nitric acid at pH 1.0 indicated
that it is quite effective for restoring adsorbents.

Experimental
Section
Synthesis Procedure of Mesoporous Fe3O4 Nanoparticles
The mesoporous hydrophilic Fe3O4 nanoparticles were prepared based on the simple and
effective co-precipitation of ferric and ferrous salts (Figure S1), as previously reported.36 Briefly, 250 mL (1.5 M) of NaOH solution and
2 mL of N2H4·H2O were added
into a three-necked round-bottom flask and heated at 85 °C. Meanwhile,
in a clean beaker, 5.2 g of FeCl3·6H2O,
2.0 g of FeCl2·4H2O, and 0.85 mL of HCl
(12 M) were dissolved in 25 mL of deionized water at room temperature.
The latter mixture was added dropwise to the former one with vigorous
stirring. A black precipitate was obtained immediately, which was
allowed to crystallize for 30 min under continuous stirring. During
the synthesis of the Fe3O4 nanoparticles, a
nitrogen atmosphere was not used because the decomposition of hydrazine
generates N2 gas.39 After formation
of Fe3O4 colloids, the solution was allowed
to cool at room temperature. Finally, the black precipitate was filtered
off by magnetic decantation, washed with ethanol and deionized water
to get rid of the unreacted reactants, and dried in a vacuum oven
at 60 °C for 4 h.

Removal Procedure of Heavy Metal Ions in
River Water
To test the applicability of Fe3O4 nanoadsorbents
in natural water, river water was chosen because groundwater and surface
water contain a complex mixture of ions. Before being used, river
water was filtered by a filter paper to remove all suspended matter.
Fe3O4 nanoadsorbents (100 mg) were added to
50 mL of river water spiked with 50 mg L–1 of each
tested ion. The mixture was shaken at 220 rpm at a constant temperature
of 25 °C. Then, at regular time intervals, the mixture was withdrawn,
the nanoadsorbents were separated by a permanent hand-hold magnet,
and the concentration of the remaining ions in the spent solution
was determined by an inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrophotometer.
