Several
microRNAs (miRNAs) have been reported to be closely related
to influenza A virus infection, replication, and immune response.
Therefore, the development of the infectious-disease detection system
using miRNAs as biomarkers is actively underway. Herein, we identified
two miRNAs (miR-181c-5p and miR-1254) as biomarkers for detection
of pandemic influenza A H1N1 virus infection and proposed the catalytic
hairpin assembly-based in vitro diagnostic (CIVD) system for a highly
sensitive diagnosis; this system is composed of two sets of cascade
hairpin probes enabling to detect miR-181c-5p and miR-1254. We demonstrated
that CIVD kits could not only detect subnanomolar levels of target
miRNAs but also distinguish even single-base mismatches. Moreover,
this CIVD kit has shown excellent detection performance in real intracellular
RNA samples and confirmed results similar to those of conventional
methods (microarray and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction).

Introduction
The influenza virus
is one of the major threats in modern public
health. It mainly infects the upper respiratory tract and results
in the massive release of inflammatory factors that lead to acute
respiratory diseases.1−3 Three influenza types (A, B, and C) are well known
as flu pathogens. Among them, the most virulent pathogen is the type
A influenza, which has various subtypes due to the combination of
18 hemagglutination proteins and 11 neuraminidase proteins, leading
to seasonal epidemics and global pandemics.4,5 Influenza
virus spreads rapidly through transmission among humans, and influenza
infection poses a serious threat to public health. According to a
WHO report, approximately 50,000 people were affected by and 2,700
people died from pH1N1 virus infection in 2009 to 2010. Hence, clinical
care, control, and prevention are very important in influenza infections.6,7 Serological assays, such as the HA inhibition assay (HAI) and enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (ELISA), are most commonly used to detect the
influenza virus using antigen-specific antibody responses. Although
these assays are simple and rapid, their sensitivity for influenza
virus subtype identification is limited for practical virus diagnosis.8 Nucleic acid-based tests (NATs), which are based
on the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique, are a powerful approach
for the identification of influenza virus subtypes. Reverse transcription
PCR (RT-PCR) is the most traditional method for influenza virus diagnosis
and is more sensitive than other immunoassays. However, this technique
requires expensive instruments and involves tedious and complicated
processes.9−11 To alleviate these concerns, a rapid and sensitive
diagnostic technique for infectious diseases needs to be developed.
Recent findings report that several cellular miRNAs are closely associated
with influenza A virus infection and replication, particularly the
immune response to virus infections due to their aberrant expression.
For example, miR-323, miR-491, and miR-654 inhibit the replication
of the H1N1 influenza A virus by regulating the BAX inhibitor gene,
and miR-200a directly regulates host immune response genes such as
IFNAR1 and STAT2.12−14 Thus, the distinctive expression patterns of miRNAs
have been shown to be associated with various pathological conditions,
and these miRNAs may be able to serve as biomarkers.15−17 Furthermore, miRNAs related to influenza have been reported to be
stably detected in serum and saliva samples.18 However, detection of miRNA is not easy because of its intrinsic
properties (21–23 nucleotides of short length and high homology) and low concentration in body
fluids (serum and saliva).19−21 Until now, northern blotting,
microarray, and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) have been widely
used to detect miRNA, but these techniques have some drawbacks, including
the need for expensive equipment, the time-consuming process, and
the large sample volumes required.22−28 To overcome these challenges, novel concepts based on nucleic acid
amplification, such as rolling circle amplification (RCA),29,30 catalytic hairpin assembly (CHA),31,32 hybridization
chain reaction (HCR),33−35 and loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP),36 have been proposed. Among these strategies,
CHA is a promising technique due to its remarkable features, such
as its enzyme-free amplification, thermal cycle-free reaction, and
low background signal. Selective binding catalyzes CHA performance,
which is an entropy-driven reaction, initiates cross-opening of two
metastable hairpin DNA probes and generates numerous signals.22,37,38 In addition, the CHA technique
is compatible with various reporting systems, such as fluorescent,
colorimetric, and electrochemical signals, through immobilization.39−42 In this study, we propose a CHA-based in vitro diagnostic system
(CIVD system) for the rapid and sensitive detection of pH1N1 virus
infection by accurate miRNA expression analysis. As shown in Scheme 1, we designed two
types of probes, hairpin A (HA) and hairpin B (HB), and used them
to establish an in vitro diagnostic platform where the HA is labeled
with biotin fixed on a streptavidin (SA)-coated sensor plate, and
a fluorescence and quencher at each end report the signal. After the
target miRNA binds with HA and generates a fluorescent signal, HB
hybridizes with open sequences of HA to release the bound miRNA. Released
target miRNA is reused as a fuel that can activate the fluorescence
signal by opening another HA. Moreover, we identified two species
of miRNA, miR-181c-5p and miR-1254, as potential biomarkers of pH1N1
virus infection by both microarray and qRT-PCR approaches.43 To achieve high reliability of the proposed
CIVD system, we designed a dual module composed of cascade hairpin
probes for detecting miR-181c-5p and miR-1254.44 Using our CIVD system, we demonstrated excellent diagnostic
performance using real cellular RNA molecules and the ability to specifically
identify pH1N1 virus infection.

Results
and Discussion
Exploration of miRNA as a Novel Biomarker
To develop
an early diagnosis system of pH1N1 virus infection using miRNA as
a biomarker, we first analyzed the miRNA expression profile in A549
cells infected with pH1N1 virus. A549 cells were infected with 1 MOI
of pH1N1 virus for 1 or 2 h and then incubated for 12 h p.i.45,46 An overview of the experimental procedure is illustrated in Scheme 1c. For global screening
of miRNA expression in influenza A virus-infected cells, we analyzed
miRNA expression profiling from virus-infected cells using microarray
technology. This microarray was performed three times on the Affymetrix
GeneChip miRNA 4.0 and profiled 30,424 species of mature miRNAs (all
organisms). From this analysis, we compared miRNA expression levels
in A549 cells that infected the pH1N1 virus to mock-infected A549
cells as a control. Among the mature miRNA species, we studied 1919
human miRNAs (Figure S1a). As a result,
we found that 19 and 46 miRNAs were upregulated with a 1.5-fold increase
compared to the control when infected with influenza virus for 1 and
2 h, respectively (Figure S1b). In particular,
12 miRNAs were reported to be overexpressed at both time criteria
(Figure 1a and Figure S1c). Thus, we considered the 12 miRNAs
as potential biomarkers for the diagnosis of pH1N1 virus infectious
diseases. To confirm the expression level of the 12 selected miRNAs,
we used qRT-PCR (Figure 1b). Among the miRNAs displayed in the qRT-PCR results, miR-181c-5p
and miR-1254 were significantly upregulated. In several previous studies,
miRNA-1254 has been implicated not only in cancer, such as non-small-cell
lung cancer (NSCLC),47,48 but also in pH1N1 infection,49 and miRNA-181c-5p has been reported to be associated
with the immune response50 and control
of viral replication in pulmonary infectious diseases such as the
Hendra virus (HeV) and the Nipah virus (NiV).51 Since the aberrant expression (over-/low expression) of miRNA can
indicate one or more diseases, we designed a dual-module diagnostic
platform for the reliable diagnosis of infectious diseases using both
miR-1254 and miR-181c-5p as diagnostic markers.52

Figure 1 MicroRNA expression profiling. (a) Microarray analysis for miRNA
was performed with RNA extracts from A549 cells 12 h postinfection
with pH1N1 virus (MOI = 1) for 1 or 2 h. The fold changes were compared
to those of mock-infected cells. (b) qRT-PCR analysis of the expression
of miRNAs. The fold changes were normalized to U6 and GAPDH and calculated
using 2–ΔΔCq.

Preparation of the Hairpin Probes for miRNA Detection
We
designed hairpin probes (HA) that can generate a fluorescence
signal when the probe detects miR-181c-5p and miR-1254 and catalytic
hairpin probes (HB) that induce signal amplification through an entropy-driven
cascade reaction (Table S1). Scheme 1 illustrates the mechanisms
of CHA-based fluorescence amplification for miRNA detection. Both
metastable hairpin probes (HA and HB) were employed in the CHA process.
In the absence of a target miRNA, these probes stably formed a hairpin
structure due to the complementary sequence at the end of each probe.
This is because the stem sequences of the probes were longer than
those of the other probes so that each probe remained thermodynamically
stable and did not hybridize with other probes. HA was labeled with
biotin at the loop, so it was immobilized on the SA-coated sensing
plate by the avidin–biotin interaction, and each end was labeled
with a fluorescence dye (FAM) and a quencher (BHQ1).53,54 Therefore, during hairpin formation, the fluorescence of the HA
was decreased with quencher molecules due to the Förster resonance
energy transfer (FRET) effect. In the presence of a target miRNA, HA hybridized with the target
miRNA and opened its folding structure. When the HA and target miRNA
hybridized, the complementary sequence of HA to another HB was exposed.
HB docked on the HA–target complex and liberated the target.
The released target miRNA was then hybridized to another HA and introduced
a new CHA circuit. To achieve optimal performance for miRNA detection
based on hairpin probes, first, the concentration of the magnesium
ion (Mg2+) was optimized. Salt, including Mg, K, and Na,
is a crucial factor in DNA thermodynamics because it regulates the
Watson–Crick binding affinity.55 Unintended hybridizing of HA and HB can occur with high noise and
is an obstacle to accurate detection of miRNA in the CHA-based technique.
Therefore, we looked for the optimal buffer conditions at various
Mg2+ concentrations. As shown in Figure S2, the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N ratio) at 12.5 mM showed
the highest signal in the targets, but that of the control also increased.
Although 5 mM is lower than the other conditions in the targets, little
noise was observed in the control. Therefore, 5 mM was chosen as the
optimal Mg2+ concentration. To further enhance the immobilization,
we optimized the concentration of SA and bHA. First, various SA concentrations
(0.1, 0.2, 0.5, and 1 μg/well) were coated onto the well plates
followed by incubation with unannealed 50 nM bHA to measure the fluorescence
signal. After washing the unbound residue, the fluorescence of bHA
was measured when there was no target miRNA (Figure S3a). Its fluorescence intensity increased as the concentration
of SA increased. Hence, a 1 μg/well concentration of SA was
chosen as the optimal condition. Then, we determined the optimal bHA
concentration by measuring the fluorescence intensity of bHA by treating
various concentrations on optimized SA-coated plates. The fluorescence
intensity was highest at 0.1 μM bHA, but the signal output decreased
at more than 0.1 μM (Figure S3b).
This is due to the self-quenching effect of excess bHA, which can
lead to inaccurate diagnostic results. As a result, we chose 0.1 μM
as the appropriate concentration of bHA. We prepared a hairpin probe-based
miRNA detection system that can be used as an in vitro diagnostic
kit for the pH1N1 virus infectious disease and evaluated the detection
performance of this kit. Based on the above results, SA (1 μg/well)
and bHA (0.1 μM) were immobilized on a well plate, and HBs were
added to the wells at various concentrations (0, 1, 10, and 100 nM).
Then, 50 nM target miRNA was added to the prepared detection wells,
and fluorescence intensity was measured every 20 min for 2 h (Figure 2a,b and Figure S4a,b). In the presence of the target
miRNA, the fluorescence intensity significantly increased due to HA
and target binding. However, in the miR-181c-5p analysis, the fluorescence
signal at 1 nM HB and 10 nM HB was similar to that of the HA-coated
well, but at 100 nM HB, the fluorescence signal increased compared
to that in the other conditions. Although the fluorescence signal
of 1 nM HB was lower than that of HA alone in the miR-1254 analysis,
both the 10 nM HB and 100 nM HB conditions showed high signal increases.
As a result of each analysis, we confirmed that the S/N ratio reached
its maximum at 100 nM HB (Figure S4c,d),
demonstrating that the optimized HB concentration was 100 nM. Moreover,
even though the concentration of HB increased, the fluorescence intensity
of the blank (absence of target) remained stable. These results indicated
that the hairpin-forming metastable probes were intact until target
detection, and the proposed strategy was well optimized and ready
to test. Three types of inconsistent (mismatch) sequences with the
target miRNA sequences were used as controls (M1: one mismatch with
the target miRNA sequence, M2: two mismatches with the target miRNA
sequence, and M3: three mismatches with the target miRNA sequence).
Furthermore, fluorescence intensities were measured for 2 h after
treatment at various concentrations of each target miRNA (miR-181c-5p
and miR-1254). As shown in Figure 3a,b, the F/F0 value (F/F0, F: fluorescence intensity at 120 min and F0: fluorescence intensity at 0 min) increases with increasing
concentration of target miRNA from 1 to 100 nM (inset: 10 pM–0.5
nM concentration range). The F/F0 value shows a strong linear correlation between the
target miRNA concentrations and the fluorescence signal with correlation
coefficients of R2 = 0.929 and 0.9779,
respectively. The limit of detection (LOD) was calculated based on
3σ/slope (σ = standard deviation of blank, n = 3) and estimated 0.06 nM (miR-181c-5p) and 0.11 nM (miR-1254).
Therefore, we can confirm that dual-module CIVD systems are capable
of quantifying miRNAs at subnanomolar levels and can be used for the
highly sensitive detection of pH1N1 virus infections. The selectivity
of our system was evaluated by using control miRNAs (M1, M2, and M3)
and a blank (only buffer). As shown in Figure 3c,d, the fluorescence intensity of the target
miRNA (50 nM) significantly increased 2.5-fold compared to the blank.
However, the M1, M2, and M3 conditions showed weak fluorescence intensity
(M1-181c-5p: 1.3-fold, M2-181c-5p: 1.1-fold, M2-181c-5p: 1.0-fold,
M1-1254: 1.5-fold, M2-1254: 1.2-fold, and M3-1254: 0.9-fold), and
fluorescence signals did not increase as the mismatch sequence increased
due to nonspecific binding. Although similar fluorescence intensities
were measured in all control groups (M1, M2, and M3) compared to the
blank, these intensities were considered to be unaffected by the selectivity
evaluation of miRNA detection. These comparisons confirm that only
perfectly complementary miRNA can initiate the CHA procedure as a
trigger for fluorescence signal amplification.

Performance Evaluation
Using Real Samples (RNA) Extracted from
Virus-Infected Cells
After the characterization, our CIVD
kit was evaluated using RNA isolated from influenza virus-infected
A549 cells as real samples. As described above, we prepared detection
wells containing bHA and HB capable of detecting two target miRNAs
(miR-181c-5p and miRNA 1254) and added 1 μg of RNA to each well
and measured the fluorescence intensities. As shown in Figure 4, the fluorescence intensity
ratio (F/F0) of the miR-181c-5p
and miR-1254 detection kits was observed for 2 h (Figure 4a,b). The miR-181c-5p level
in infected cells significantly increased by 47% (1 h) and 61% (2
h) compared with the levels in mock-infected cells (control). Likewise,
the miR-1254 level in infected cells was 161% (1 h) and 107% (2 h)
higher in the fluorescence recovery ratio. These results showed good
agreement with the results of the microarray and qRT-PCR analysis
(Figure 4c,d). In addition,
we evaluated the detection ability using various influenza A (pH1N1,
H3N2, H5N2, and H6N5) viruses and influenza B virus-infected cells.
RNA samples were extracted from cells infected with each virus for
1 h as described above. As shown in Figure 5 and Figure S6, the F/F0 value was
observed in the miRNA of A549 cells infected with various influenza
viruses, including influenza A (pH1N1, H3N2, H5N2, and H6N5) viruses
and influenza B virus. As a result of miR-181c-5p analysis (Figure 5a and Figure S6a),
the F/F0 values of pH1N1
virus-infected cells and infected cells of other viruses increased
compared to mock-infected cells, and the highest response was observed
in H6N5 virus infection. Recently, members of the miR-181 family (miR-181a–d) have
been identified to control immune responses in infectious diseases
by promoting B-cell differentiation.56,57 The analysis
of miR-181c-5p allows for the recognition of pathogen invasion, but
there are limits to the selective detection of pH1N1 infection. The
miR-1254 analysis generated the highest signal only in pH1N1 infection,
whereas in other virus infections, the fluorescence signals were similar
to those of mock-infected cells (control) (Figure 5b and Figure S6b). We analyzed miR-181c-5p and miR-1254 using dual-module CIVD kits
and confirmed that the proposed systems could selectively distinguish
pH1N1 infection from other influenza strains.

kit and (b) the miR-1254 kit for 2 h. The total RNA was isolated from
the negative control (NC; only hairpin probes), the mock-infected
cells (no virus treated), 1 h-infected cells, and 2 h-infected cells

for 2 h (*p < 0.05, **p <
0.005).

Conclusions
In
this report, we suggested two species of miRNA as novel clinical
biomarkers of influenza A virus infection and established a highly
sensitive CIVD system. We studied the miRNA expression profile of
the pH1N1-infected A549 cell line by using a microarray assay and
qPCR and identified two miRNAs, hsa-miR-181c-5p and hsa-miR-1254,
that can be used as diagnostic indicators for the detection of infectious
disease. To detect these miRNAs, we designed programmed metastable
hairpin probes and fixed the reporter probes on the sensing plate
by using the strong affinity of avidin–biotin interaction.
The fluorescence signal was amplified by hybridization of two types
of hairpin probes to detect the target miRNA. Our proposed CIVD systems
can detect subnanomolar amounts of target miRNAs without protein enzymes
and thermal cycling steps and have the selectivity to distinguish
even a single-base mismatch. In addition, we confirmed the detection
performance in real RNA samples and compared it with the performance
in other virus infections. Finally, we developed highly sensitive
miRNA detection methods that could be potential diagnostic tools for
pH1N1 infection by dual-module analysis of the expression of miR-181c-5p
and miR-1254.

Cell Culture and Virus Infection Protocol
A549 cells
(human lung epithelial cells, ATCC no. CCL-185) were grown in RPMI-1640
medium containing 5% FBS and 1% P/S at 37 °C in a humidified
atmosphere with 5% CO2. Following this incubation, cells
(1 × 106 cells/well) were plated in 6-well culture
plates and grown overnight before viral infection. A549 cells were
infected with influenza viruses at multiplicities of infection (MOIs)
of 1 after washing thrice in DPBS (1 MOI = 1 virus particle/cell).
All viruses used in this study were quantified by qRT-PCR. Cells were
coincubated with influenza viruses in serum-free RPMI-1640 medium
containing 1% P/S and 1 μg/mL TPCK trypsin at 37 °C for
1 or 2 h. After virus infection, the cellular medium containing the
virus was changed to a fresh culture medium. Virus-infected cells
were further incubated for 12 h postinfection (p.i.) at 37 °C.

Screening miRNAs as Potential Biomarkers of Virus Infection
Diseases
Virus-infected A549 cells along with their culture
medium were transferred into 2 mL tubes. The mixture was centrifuged
for 10 min at 3200g. After centrifugation, the supernatant
was discarded, and total RNA was extracted from the pellet according
to miRNeasy Mini Kit protocols (Qiagen). The concentration of extracted
RNA was quantified by the NanoDrop 2000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific)
and stored at −80 °C before use. For the exploration of
biomarkers, extracted RNA was analyzed by nucleic acid analysis using
microarray and qRT-PCR assays. miRNA microarray analysis was performed
by Macrogen (Korea). The analysis method is briefly described as follows.
The Affymetrix GeneChip miRNA 4.0 array process was executed according
to the manufacturer’s protocol. Before the assay, RNA purity
and integrity were evaluated by an ND-1000 spectrophotometer (NanoDrop,
Wilmington, U.S.A.) and an Agilent 2100 bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies,
Palo Alto, U.S.A.). A total of 1000 ng of RNA samples was labeled
with the FlashTag biotin RNA labeling kit (Genisphere, Hatfield, PA,
U.S.A.). The labeled RNA was quantified, fractionated, and hybridized
to the miRNA microarray according to the standard procedures provided
by the manufacturer. The labeled RNA was heated to 99 °C for
5 min and then to 45 °C for 5 min. RNA-array hybridization was
performed with agitation at 60 rotations per minute for 16 h at 48
°C on an Affymetrix GeneChip Fluidics Station 450. The chips
were washed and stained using a GeneChip Fluidics Station 450 (Affymetrix,
Santa Clara, California, U.S.A.). The chips were then scanned with
an Affymetrix GCS 3000 scanner (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, California,
U.S.A.). Signal values were computed using the Affymetrix GeneChip
Command Console software. To select the optimal miRNAs as biomarkers
among the overexpressed miRNAs in the microarray analysis, we also
performed a qRT-PCR assay. RNA extracted from virus-infected A549
cells was synthesized with cDNA using the miScript II RT Kit (Qiagen).
The qRT-PCR assay was carried out according to the miScript SYBR Green
PCR Kit protocol and performed using the CFX96 Touch Real-Time PCR
detection system (BIO-RAD). All primers used in this study were obtained
from Qiagen. The relative quantitation was calculated using 2–ΔΔCq methods.58

Design of Hairpin Probes on the Detection Plate
HA
and HB were designed based on the principle of the enzyme-free target
recycling circuit system, CHA, according to the target miRNA sequences.
The sequences of HA and HB are described in Table S1. For the immobilization of HA on the detection plate by
avidin–biotin interaction, biotinylated HA (bHA) was synthesized
by replacing one T present at the loop site with biotin-dT. Prior
to the experiments, each probe (HA, bHA, and HB) was prepared by annealing
(keeping at 90 °C for 5 min and then slowly cooling down to room
temperature). Therefore, all probes were formed into hairpin structures
and stored at −20 °C before use.

Immobilization of Biotinylated
Hairpin A (bHA) on the Detection
Plate
The SA solution was prepared by dissolving SA in a
coating buffer (carbonate–bicarbonate buffer). This SA solution
was added to a 96-well black bottom immune plate (SPL, Korea) and
incubated at 4 °C overnight. After washing twice with PBS-T (PBS
containing 0.05% v/v Tween-20), the prepared SA-coated plate was treated
with bHA (100 nM–1 μM) and incubated at 37 °C for
90 min. After immobilization, the plate was washed twice with PBS-T.

Fluorescence Kinetics Measurement
HB was treated with
HA (50 μL) or bHA immobilized on the plate up to 100 μL.
Before synthetic RNA or real RNA sample testing, the fluorescence
intensity of non-template-containing solutions (F0) was measured. One hundred microliters of RNA sample
was added to the detection plate. Each fluorescence intensity was
measured every 20 min for 2 h (F) by a Cytation 5
plate reader (BioTek) (λex = 484 nm, λem = 530 nm).
