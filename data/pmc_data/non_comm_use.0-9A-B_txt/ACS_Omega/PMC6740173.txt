Electrospun
nanofiber membrane (ENM) with huge specific surface
area is an ideal solid substrate for sensors. However, only a few
ENMs are developed into colorimetric sensors and it is even more challenging
to fabricate multiple-ion-responsive ENM-based colorimetric sensor.
In this study, benefiting from the excellent metal ion adsorption
ability of poly(aspartic acid) (PASP) and high specific surface area
of nanofibers, a reusable colorimetric sensor utilizing PASP electrospun
nanofiber hydrogel membrane (ENHM) was designed to detect Cu2+ and Fe3+ in aqueous solution with simple filtration.
The sensor based on PASP–ENHM exhibited high sensitivity and
selectivity, and colorimetric responses for Cu2+ and Fe3+ detection could be observed by the naked eye. Upon exposure
to Cu2+ aqueous solution, the color of the sensor changed
from white to blue with a naked eye detection limit of 0.3 mg/L, while
it turned from white to yellow with a detection limit of 0.1 mg/L
for Fe3+ detection. Furthermore, this sensor was reusable
after metal ion extraction by the desorption process.

1 Introduction
Nowadays,
widespread existence of free metal ions in water are
potentially threatening to the ecosystem and public health. The detection
of metal ions is becoming essential.1,2 In the past
decades, various equipment have been used to detect and analyze metal
ions, such as atomic absorption spectrometry, atomic emission spectrometry,
inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, and so on.3,4 Although these strategies are widely accepted and can achieve accurate
results, they have disadvantages of complicated manipulation, high
cost, and time consuming. To overcome these disadvantages, various
rapid and sensitive detection techniques for metal ions have been
developed.5−7 In particular, colorimetric sensing approach has
attracted considerable attention because of its simplicity of operation,
rapidity, low cost, and direct visual perception. To increase sensitivity,
most colorimetric sensors are dispersed in sample solution for full
contact to target substance, but the uneven and unsteady dispersion
of the sensors often induces unstable detection results. In order
to avoid this problem, chemosensor can be assembled on a solid substrate.8 In this case, the selection of a solid substrate
is extremely important as it can significantly affect the sensitivity
of the sensor.

Electrospun nanofiber membrane (ENM) has the
merits of huge specific
surface area, high porosity, controllable structure, and easy functionalization.
It is an ideal solid substrate for chemosensor.9−11 Chemosensor
can be physically adsorbed or chemically linked onto electrospun nanofibers.12−14 In a ENM-immobilized sensor, the chemosensor is responsible to bind
with the target substance for sensing, and the ENM provides a large
quantity of active sites for chemosensor contacting target substance
to improve sensor’s sensibility. In another approach, ENM can
be utilized to adsorb the target substance from the sample solution
first and then chemosensor is applied to detect the concentrated target
substance.15 However, only a few ENMs have
been employed for fabrication of colorimetric sensors as most of chemosensors
can hardly be electrospun into ENMs directly. To construct a ENM-based
colorimetric sensor for metal ion detection, it is a challenging to
develop a electrospinning material polymer with metal ions adsorbability.

Poly(aspartic acid) (PASP) is a synthetic poly(amino acid) with
several unique characteristics including metal ions binding capacity,
biocompatibility, biodegradability, water solubility, and low toxicity.
The development and application of PASP-based polymers have gained
remarkable attention in a variety of fields. The low-cost and easy
synthesis creates growing possibilities of PASP application in numerous
industries. It is already accessible on a commercial scale as Baypure
DS 100 produced by Lanxess (Germany). Moreover, a current need for
eco-friendly materials as chelating agent, dispersant, and antiscalant
provides an opportunity for PASP to be employed as a new generation
of products in water treatment field. Although many studies have been
demonstrated the metal ion binding capacity of PASP, the dissolution
property limits its application as a electrospinning material and
ENM-based colorimetric sensor.

In this study, we devoted efforts
to design a PASP-based colorimetric
sensor with a nanofibrous structure for Cu2+ and Fe3+ detection. PASP was fabricated into the electrospun nanofiber
hydrogel membrane (ENHM) by electrospinning of its precursor and further
treatment. Then PASP–ENHM was designed to detect Cu2+ and Fe3+ in aqueous solution by the filtering method.
Because of the strong metal ion adsorptivity of PASP and the large
specific surface area of ENHM, numerous Cu2+ or Fe3+ ions were accumulated on PASP–ENHM after filtration.
The PASP–ENHM exhibited naked eye perceptible color changes
as the concentration of Cu2+ or Fe3+ in the
aqueous solution changes. Additionally, the ions adsorbed by PASP–ENHM
can be removed by the desorption process, and therefore the PASP–ENHM-based
colorimetric sensor was recoverable and reusable.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Preparation and Properties
of PASP–ENHM
The cross-linked hydrogel network can
barely be directly prepared
by the electrospinning process. Instead, ENHMs are commonly fabricated
by electrospinning of the precursor of the hydrogel and further postprocess.16,17 PASP hydrogel can be prepared by hydrolysis of cross-linked polysuccinimide
(PSI).18,19 Therefore, in this study, PSI with the linear
molecular structure was selected as the electrospinning precursor
for PASP–ENHM preparation. High-molecular weight PSI (Mw 31 500) was synthesized from L-aspartic
acid (L-ASP) with the catalyst of phosphoric acid20−22 and electrospun
into PSI–ENM. The obtained PSI–ENM was then cross-linked
and hydrolyzed into PASP–ENHM, as shown in Scheme 1. The resultant PASP nanofibers
had a larger diameter than PSI nanofibers, while the nanofibrous geometric
characteristic was still retained.

Scheme 1 Fabrication Procedure of PASP–ENHM
and Ion Detection Process
of PASP–ENHM-Based Sensor
The Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) spectrum of
PASP–ENHM was presented in Figure 1. The broad band appearing at 3279 cm–1 was assigned to stretching of −OH and −NH2 groups.23 The bands at 1638 and
1548 cm–1 were assigned to the amide-I/II bands.24 The band at 1548 cm–1 was
also attributed to the asymmetric stretching of −COO–. The band at 1390 cm–1 was associated with the
symmetric stretching of −COO–.25 It indicated that PASP–ENHM had a high
amount of amino groups, carboxylic groups, and amide groups. These
functional groups endowed PASP–ENHM excellent metal-ion binding
property.

2.2 Basic Mechanism for Visual Detection of Cu2+ and Fe3+
Cu2+ dissolved in
water transforms into Cu(H2O)62+ and
appears blue.26 The color is invisible
to the naked eye and even difficult to detect by the UV–vis
spectrophotometer if the concentration of Cu2+ is too low.
As shown in Figure 2A, a stronger UV–vis absorption signal was detected when the
concentration of Cu2+ increased from 0.1 to 100 mg/L, which
suggests the higher the Cu2+ concentration the better the
detectability. The color of the sensor depends on the amount of Cu2+ captured by PASP–ENHM. Because of the excellent Cu2+ adsorptivity of PASP and the large surface area of ENHM,
Cu2+ ions will be captured by PASP–ENHM as the Cu2+ aqueous solution filtering through. The more Cu2+ ions accumulate on the PASP–ENHM-based sensor, the deeper
color the sensor will be. The color becomes visible to the naked eye
when the accumulated Cu2+ reaches a certain level.

Figure 2 UV–vis
absorption spectra of aqueous solutions with different
concentration of Cu2+ (A) and Fe3+ (B).

Fe3+ can be detected by the PASP–ENHM-based
colorimetric
sensor too, although PASP–ENHM adsorbs less Fe3+ ions from Fe3+ aqueous solution as shown in our previous
study.27 PASP–ENHM deswells in Fe3+ solution28,29 and Fe3+ tends to
form Fe(OH)3 micelles with a large diameter, which prevent
Fe3+ ions from diffusing into PASP–ENHM. When the
filtrating method is adopted as demonstrated in this study, Fe3+ solution is forced to pass through the PASP–ENHM
and thus Fe3+ ions are captured by the PASP–ENHM.
Consequently, the PASP–ENHM sensor shows the change of color
as the amount of Fe3+ ions captured by the PASP–ENHM
changed. As shown in Figure 2B, when the concentration of Fe3+ aqueous solution
is above 10 mg/L, the solution appeared yellow, which could be detected
by naked eye and UV–vis spectrophotometer.

2.3 Effect of PASP–ENHM Thickness
To investigate
the effect of PASP–ENHM thickness on the color
response, sensors prepared by different thickness (0.01–0.3
mm) of PASP–ENHM were utilized for the detection of 1 mg/L
Cu2+ and 1 mg/L Fe3+ aqueous solution, respectively.
As shown in Figure 3, sensors appeared blue for Cu2+ detection and yellow
for Fe3+ detection. The color of the sensors was indistinguishable
by the naked eye at a thickness of 0.01 mm. When the thickness increased
to 0.05 mm, the color of the sensor can be easily detected by the
naked eye. The sensor showed deeper color when its thickness increased
0.1 mm. Thicker PASP–ENHM had a larger surface area and provided
more active sites, which thus captured more Cu2+ or Fe3+ ions and hence appeared deeper in color. However, the color
of the sensor stopped changing as the thickness continuously increased
because of the fixed amount of Cu2+ and Fe3+ in sample solutions limited the maximum amount of Cu2+ and Fe3+ ions that could be captured by the sensor. Based
on this test result, PASP–ENHM with a fixed thickness of 0.1
mm was used in subsequent experiments.

Figure 3 Effect of PASP–ENHM
thickness on the color response for
Cu2+ and Fe3+ detection.

2.4 Colorimetric Determination of Cu2+
The colorimetric response of the sensor to Cu2+ aqueous
solution with different concentrations was observed by the
naked eye and then recorded by spectro-colorimeter. As shown in Figure 4A, the reflection
spectra of the sensors varied upon the concentration change of Cu2+. With 0.1 mg/L Cu2+ solution, the color change
of the sensor was hardly detectable and the reflectance curve of the
sensor was almost the same as that of the blank sample. As Cu2+ concentration increased, the reflectance intensity of sensors
at 660 nm decreased progressively. The reflectance spectrum of the
sensor that was used to test 100 mg/L Cu2+ solution started
to overlap with the one used for 30 mg/L Cu2+ solution,
which suggests that the PASP–ENHM sensor is almost saturated
with Cu2+ ions when the concentration of the solution reached
30 mg/L and can hardly capture more Cu2+ ions, therefore,
the color of the sensors stopped changing. It is hence concluded that
the effective detection limit of the sensor for Cu2+ is
around 0.3–30 mg/L.

Figure 4 (A) Reflectance spectra and (B) optical colorimetric
response of
sensors for Cu2+ detection, (C) color-differentiation map
based on L*a*b values.

Figure 4B shows
the color change of sensors corresponding to the Cu2+ concentration
variation. The color of the sensors demonstrated distinguishable changes
from white to blue upon the increase of Cu2+ concentration,
which could be clearly identified by the naked eye or a charge-coupled
device (CCD) camera. The naked eye detection limits were 0.3–30
mg/L which agreed well with the reflectance spectra. When Cu2+ concentration reached 1 mg/L, the color sensor became clearly distinguishable,
and China’s Ministry of Health limits the maximum levels of
copper to 1 mg/L, suggesting that the sensor is viable naked eye chemosensors
for Cu2+ detection in drinking water. To avoid the individual
differences in color identification, a converting method was introduced
to standardize the color with L*a*b values. The L*a*b parameters of the free sensor were 90.63, −0.88,
and 0.07, respectively, and the sensor showed a white color. With
the increase of Cu2+ concentration from 0.3 to 30 mg/L,
the L*a*b parameters
all decreased (Table S1). Therefore, the
color of the sensors change to blue gradually. With the L*a*b values, the color-differentiation
map can be easily generated for Cu2+ concentration identification,
as shown in Figure 4C.

To evaluate the antidisturbance capability of the PASP–ENHM-based
sensor for Cu2+ detection, competitive experiment was conducted
by adding Cu2+ (1 mg/L) into test solution in the presence
of other metal ions (1 mg/L), including Ca2+, Mg2+, Sn2+, Zn2+, Ni2+, Pb2+, Co2+. As shown in Figure 5, these metal ions did not exhibit observable interference
for Cu2+ detection, although Pb and Sn element on PASP–ENHM
were detected by energy-dispersive spectrometer (EDS). Pb2+ and Sn2+ tended to form white precipitation in water,
which could be partially captured by PASP–ENHM as the test
solution filtering through and detected by EDS. Because the white
background was used by the sensor, the captured Pb2+ and
Sn2+ have no effect on Cu2+ detection. In fact,
it is reported that PASP has the complexing ability toward Hg2+, Cd2+, Ca2+, Zn2+, and
so forth.30,31 Compared with PASP, PASP hydrogel cross-linked
by ethylenediamine (ED) has abundant −CO–NH–
and −NH2 functional groups on the side chain, which
have a stronger complexing ability toward Cu2+. Moreover,
the strength of complexation decreases in the following order: Cu2+ > Pb2+ ≈ Co2+ > Zn2+ > Mn2+.32 Consequently,
Cu2+ has a higher tendency to bind to PASP–ENHM
and forms
more stable complexes compared with other metal ions.33

Cu2+ in the presence of different metal ions (B).

2.5 Colorimetric Determination
of Fe3+
Besides the capability of Cu2+ detection, the
PASP–ENHM is also suitable for colorimetric detection of Fe3+. As shown in Figure 6, the reflectance intensity of the sensors at 430 nm decreased
as the Fe3+ concentration increased. When the concentration
of Fe3+ increased from 0.1 to 10 mg/L, the color of the
sensors changed from white to light yellow, then deep yellow, which
was distinguishable by the naked eye according to CCD camera picture
and color-differentiation map. It is worth pointing out that the permissible
contamination level of Fe3+ in drinking water regulated
by China’s Ministry of Health (GB5749-2006) is 0.3 mg/L, which
is well covered by the detection limits of this sensor.

spectra and (B) optical colorimetric responses
of sensors for Fe3+ detection, (C) color-differentiation
map based on L*a*b values.

To examine the effect of other
metal ions on the selectivity of
this sensor for Fe3+ detection, competition experiment
was also conducted by detecting Fe3+ in the presence of
various 1 mg/L metal ions (Ca2+, Mg2+, Sn2+, Zn2+, Ni2+, Pb2+, Co2+). As seen in Figure 7, the color of the sensors barely changed with the presence
of other metal ions, suggesting the interference of surveyed metal
ions was negligible though the EDS spectrum proved the adsorption
of Pb and Sn on PASP–ENHM, similar to the competitive experiment
for Cu2+ detection. In test solution, Fe3+ ions
in the form of Fe(OH)3 micelles were easy to be captured
on PASP–ENHM and appeared yellow. Other metal ions had less
effect on the formation of Fe(OH)3 micelles and the Fe3+ detection, which gave the selectivity performance to the
PASP–ENHM-based sensor.

of Fe3+ (A) and
Fe3+ in the presence of different metal ions (B).

2.6 Coexistence Study for Cu2+ and
Fe3+
To investigate the color response of the
PASP–ENHM sensor when Cu2+ and Fe3+ coexist,
solution containing different concentrations of Cu2+ and
Fe3+ was tested. As shown in Figure 8, the sensors displayed different colors
according to variation of the concentration of Cu2+ and
Fe3+. When 0.1 mg/L Fe3+ was added into Cu2+ solution, the color of the sensors changed from bright blue
to yellow-green, indicating that Cu2+ ions and Fe3+ ions were both adsorbed on the PASP–EHNM and sensor appeared
blend colors of blue and yellow. In the case of Fe3+ detection,
the color of the sensors generated by Cu2+ was masked,
which was attributed to the competitive adsorption of Fe3+ over Cu2+.

and (B)

2.7 Reusability
of PASP–ENHM-Based Sensor
The reusability of the PASP–ENHM-based
sensor was investigated
by repeated desorption and detection tests. The sensors after 1 mg/L
Cu2+ detection were immersed in hydrochloric acid (HCl)
and ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA) solution in turn to dissolve
Cu2+ captured on PASP–ENHM and reverted to the sensor’s
original unpolluted white color. As shown in Figure 9, PASP–ENHM-based sensors demonstrated
stable sensing property for repeated detection tests. Moreover, similar
results were obtained with repeated detection tests of 1 mg/L Fe3+. The reusable principle of PASP–ENHM sensors is:
metal ions are bound to PASP–ENHM by amide groups and carboxylic
groups which are protonated at low pH value and lose the capability
of capturing metal ions, as shown in Scheme 2. Consequently, the metal ions on PASP–ENHM
are removed. In the Fe3+ detection test, Fe(OH)3 intercepted by PASP–ENHM are converted back to Fe3+ and dissolved back to the solution, and EDTA with excellent strong
complexation ability to metal ions formed complexes with Cu2+ and Fe3+, which contributed to the metal ion removal
from PASP–ENHM. Then, the PASP–ENHM without complexes
and precipitate recovered its sensing ability and was reusable.

Groups
3 Conclusions
A new reusable colorimetric sensor based on PASP–ENHM was
developed for naked eye detection of Cu2+ and Fe3+, by taking advantage of the large specific surface area of the nanofibers
and the excellent metal ion binding property of PASP. The PASP–ENHM-based
sensors exhibited an distinguishable color change from white to blue
with Cu2+ concentration varied from 0.3 to 30 mg/L, and
from white to yellow with Fe3+ concentration increased
from 0.1 to 10 mg/L. The naked eye detection limits of Cu2+ and Fe3+ were as low as 0.3 and 0.1 mg/L, respectively.
The existence of other metal ions showed negligible interference for
Cu2+ and Fe3+ detection. The discrimination
between Cu2+ and Fe3+ under their coexistence
could be distinguished by the naked eye too. The high sensitivity,
wide naked eye detection limit and the reusability of PASP–ENHM-based
sensor for Cu2+ and Fe3+ suggest that it is
a viable, economic, and straightforward Cu2+ and Fe3+ sensor, and can potentially be widely used for drinking
water Cu2+ and Fe3+ pollution detection.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Reagents and Apparatus
L-ASP and
phosphoric acid (85 wt % in H2O) were purchased from Aladdin. N,N-Dimethylformamide (DMF), ED, sodium
hydroxide (NaOH), and HCl were purchased from Fisher Scientific. Metal
salts (CaCl2, FeCl3, ZnCl2, SnCl2, NiCl2, CuCl2, Pb(NO3)2, AgNO3) and EDTA were supplied by Sigma-Aldrich.
Distilled water was used throughout the study. All chemicals were
of analytical grade purity and used without further purification.

The morphology and chemical composition of the nanofiber membranes
were examined by the scanning electron microscope (S3000N, Hitachi
Ltd., Japan) and EDS. The FTIR spectrum was recorded with an FTIR
spectroscope with a diamond attenuated total reflection sampling accessory
(Frontier, PerkinElmer, USA). Visible absorption spectra were obtained
on a UV–vis spectrophotometer (Cary 5000, Varian, USA) with
a 1.0 cm quartz cell in the wavelength range from 400 to 700 nm. A
spectro-colorimeter (Labscan XE, HunterLab, USA) was used for determining
reflectance spectra and L*a*b values of the PASP–ENHM-based colorimetric sensor.

4.2 Preparation of PASP–ENHM
PSI,
the precursor of PASP, was synthesized and electrospun into the nanofiber
membrane according to our previously reported method.34 PSI was polymerized by L-ASP in the presence of phosphoric
acid. The PSI nanofiber membrane was prepared under a typical electrospinning
procedure. Thirty weight percentage PSI solution was obtained by dissolving
PSI in DMF with stirring for 12 h at 50 °C. Then, the solution
was fed into a syringe equipped with a steel needle (18 G). Electrospinning
was carried out using NEU (nanofiber electrospinning unit, Kato Tech.,
Japan) with an applied voltage of 16 kV, the feed rate was 0.6 mm/min
and the tip-to-collector distance was 18 cm. To acquire thickness
uniformity of PSI–ENM, the target and traverse speed were set
at 1 m/min and 3 cm/min, respectively. PSI–ENM with different
thicknesses were fabricated by varying electrospinning time. Then
PSI–ENM was cut into a 40 mm × 40 mm square for test.

PASP–ENHM was produced from PSI–ENM in two steps. First,
PSI–ENM was immersed in 0.3 mol/L ED solution for 2 h under
room temperature for cross-linking reaction. Then, 0.2 mol/L NaOH
solution was added into the solution to turn PSI into PASP by hydrolysis
and hence PASP–ENHM was obtained.

4.3 Colorimetric
Sensing of Cu2+ and
Fe3+ Aqueous Solutions
PASP–ENHM supported
by a nonwoven fabric was served as the colorimetric sensor. The sensor
was fixed onto a filtering unit, as shown in Scheme 1. The bottom diameter of the filter cup was
35 mm. Two hundred milliliter aqueous solution with predetermined
amount of metal ions was used as sample solution for each filter test.
The sample solution was poured into the filter cup and forced to pass
through the sensor by the force of gravity. Then colorimetric response
of the sensor was examined qualitatively by the naked eye and recorded
quantitatively by a spectro-colorimeter, respectively. Photoshop was
employed to generate color-differentiation map according to the L*a*b values acquired
by the spectro-colorimeter.

In order to evaluate the reusability
of the PASP–ENHM-based colorimetric sensors, desorption experiments
were conducted to remove metal ions from the used sensors. First,
the sensors were used for Cu2+ (1 mg/L) or Fe3+ (1 mg/L) detection. After the detection tests, metal ions were removed
from the used sensors by immersing the sensors in 1 mol/L HCl solution
for 5 min and followed by washing with distilled water several times,
then 0.5 mol/L EDTA solution and distilled water several times. The
detection and desorption processes were repeated in several cycles.
