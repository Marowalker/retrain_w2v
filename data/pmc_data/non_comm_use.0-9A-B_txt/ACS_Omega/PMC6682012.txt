A unified
and common intermediate strategy for syntheses of juglomycins
and their derivatives is reported. The use of a 1,4-dimethoxynaphthalene
derivative as a key intermediate enabled easy access to various juglomycin
derivatives. In this study, juglomycins A–D, juglomycin C amide,
khatmiamycin and its 4-epimer, and the structure proposed for juglomycin
Z were synthesized from this intermediate. The absolute configuration
of natural khatmiamycin has been established to be 3R,4R through our synthesis. Unfortunately, the spectroscopic
data for synthetic juglomycin Z were not consistent with the data
reported for the natural one, strongly suggesting a structural misassignment.

Introduction
Juglomycins A (1) and B (2) were isolated
from Streptomyces sp. 190-2 (Figure 1).1,2 They
are composed of 1,4-naphthoquinone with a lactone at the side chain
and are diastereomers possessing different stereochemistries at the
4′-position of each structure. The absolute configuration of 1 was determined to be 3′R,4′R with X-ray crystallography.3 The absolute configuration of 2 was subsequently determined
to be 3′R,4′S.3 Juglomycin C (3) was isolated from Streptomyces sp. 815 and 3094.4 This compound, which possesses a carboxyl group at the
side chain, is a reduced form of 1 and 2 at the 4′-position. Naphthoquinone-8-hydroxy-3-[(3S)-acetoxybutyric acid] [(S)-NHAB, 4], a 3-O-acetylated derivative of 3, was isolated from a disruptant of the actVI-ORFA gene for
the biosynthesis of actinorhodin in Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2).5,6 Compound 4 is considered to
be a key intermediate in the biosynthesis of juglomycins A–C.7 During the course of the identification of the
gene clusters for these natural 1,4-naphthoquinones, juglomycin C
amide (5) was isolated from S. coelicolor A3(2) M145.7 Juglomycin D (6), isolated from Streptomyces sp.
815 and 3094, is an oxidized form of 3 at the 3′-position.4 Juglomycin Z (7), isolated from
the culture filtrate of Streptomyces tendae Tü 901/8c, has a methyl group at the 3′-position.8 Khatmiamycin (8) was isolated from
the culture broth of Streptomyces sp.
ANK313. This compound is an ester derivative of 1 or 2, but the absolute configurations at the 3- and 4-positions
have not been determined.9

and their derivatives. Selected carbon
atoms have been labeled using the IUPAC numbering system.

Natural 1,4-naphthoquinones have attractive biological
activities.10 Juglomycins A and B show
antibacterial activity
against Gram-positive bacteria such as Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Gram-negative bacteria
such as Escherichia coli, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis.1,2 Juglomycin
C and the methyl ester of juglomycin D exhibit moderate antibacterial
activity against B. subtilis and E. coli.4 Juglomycin Z
shows antibacterial activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative
bacteria and yeast. The antibacterial activity of this compound against Bacillus brevis is a 10-fold potent than that of
juglomycin A.8 Khatmiamycin exhibits potent
motility inhibitory and lytic activities against zoospores as well
as potent antibacterial activity against S. aureus and Streptomyces viridochromogenes.9

Several synthetic studies on
juglomycins and their derivatives
have been reported.10 The synthesis of
(±)-1 and (±)-2 was reported by
Giles and co-workers.11 Brimble and co-workers
achieved the formal synthesis of (±)-1 and (±)-2 via oxidative fragmentation of furo[3,2-b]naphtho[2,1-d]furans.12,13 The racemic and asymmetric synthesis of 1 using a reaction
of a naphthol anion with a chiral aldehyde was reported by Kraus and
co-workers.14,15 Min and co-workers synthesized
(±)-1 from 1-hydroxy-5-methoxynaphthalene.16 The Dötz benzannulation route to the
enantioselective synthesis of (−)- and (+)-1 has
been reported by Fernandes and co-workers.17−19 Both enantiomers
of 3 and 4 were synthesized by the stereoselective
aldol reaction of chiral sulfoxides with an aldehyde by our group.20 During the course of our synthesis on juglorubin, 6 was obtained as a byproduct by treatment of 3 with a phosphate buffer (pH 8.5) under aerobic conditions.21

In this paper, a unified approach toward
the syntheses of juglomycins
A–D, juglomycin C amide, khatmiamycin, and the structure proposed
for juglomycin Z is reported. Through the synthesis of khatmiamycin
and its 4-epimer, determination of the relative and absolute configuration
of natural khatmiamycin has been achieved. The spectroscopic data
for synthetic juglomycin Z and its methyl ester do not match those
reported, suggesting that the structure assigned to juglomycin Z is
incorrect.

Results and Discussion
Our synthetic approach toward
the syntheses of juglomycins A–D,
Z, juglomycin C amide, and khatmiamycin is outlined in Scheme 1. The optically active compound 9(22) can be easily converted into
the corresponding carboxylic acid (10). We envisioned
that 10 would serve as a potential common intermediate
to access to the member of juglomycins and their related derivatives.
Juglomycins A (1) and B (2) will be synthesized
by formation of a lactone through benzylic oxidation of 10, followed by oxidation of naphthalene and removal of protective
groups. Khatmiamycin (8) can be prepared by methanolysis
of 1 or 2. Oxidation of the naphthalene
in 10 and removal of the protective groups in 13 will afford juglomycin C (3). Epoxidation of 3 and isomerization of the corresponding epoxide 14 will give juglomycin D (6). Amidation of 10, oxidation, and removal of the protective groups in 15 will afford juglomycin C amide (5). Juglomycin Z (7) will be synthesized by introduction of the methyl group
into the 3′-position of 13, followed by deprotection
of the protective groups in 16.

Scheme 1 Synthetic Approach
toward Juglomycins and Their Derivatives
Selected
carbon atoms have been
labeled using the IUPAC numbering system.

The synthesis of juglomycins A (1) and B (2) is depicted in Scheme 2. Deprotection of the tert-butyldimethylsilyl
(TBS) group in 9(22) with tetra-n-butylammonium fluoride (TBAF) gave the corresponding alcohol 17. Oxidation of the primary alcohol in 17 through
Dess–Martin oxidation23 and Pinnick
oxidation24 gave carboxylic acid 10. The desired intramolecular oxidative cyclization proceeded
by treatment of 10 with 2,3-dichloro-5,6-dicyano-p-benzoquinone (DDQ) in the presence of molecular sieves
4A (MS4A) in dichloroethane to give 11 and 12 in 14 and 70% yields, respectively. The selectivity of this reaction
can be rationalized by the following hypothesis: the formation of 11 would be disfavored by the pseudo-1,3-diaxial interaction
between the naphthyl group and the hydrogen at the pseudo-axial position
in intermediate I (Scheme 3). Oxidation of the 1,4-dimethoxynaphthalene moiety
in 11 and 12 with ceric ammonium nitrate
(CAN) followed by removal of two methoxymethyl (MOM) groups afforded 1 and 2, respectively. The spectroscopic data
of synthetic 1 and 2 are identical with
those of natural ones.3

Scheme 2 Synthesis of Juglomycins
A (1) and B (2)
Scheme 3 Proposed Mechanism for the Stereoselectivity of the Intramolecular
Oxidative Cyclization of 10
The synthesis and determination of the absolute configuration
of
khatmiamycin (8) were achieved (Scheme 4). Treatment of 1 with p-toluenesulfonic acid monohydrate (TsOH·H2O) in methanol at 50 °C for 2.5 h gave 8 in 38%
yield with 37% of recovered 1. Although several conditions
were investigated to improve the yield of 8, no significant
improvement was achieved. Increased reaction time and reaction temperature
caused decomposition of 1 and 8. Methanolysis
of 1 under basic conditions gave a complex mixture. We
presume that the equilibrium between 1 and 8 exists. The 1H and 13C NMR spectra of synthetic 8 agreed with those reported for natural 8.9 The specific rotation of synthetic 8 was determined to be [α]D25 −103.3 (c 0.10, MeOH).
The specific rotation for natural 8 was reported to be
[α]D25 −21.0 (c 0.10, MeOH). Although the specific
rotation value of synthetic 8 was different from that
of natural 8, the sign of synthetic 8 was
identical to that of natural 8. The differences in the
values should be due to the presence of impurities in natural 8. On the basis of these results, the absolute configuration
of natural khatmiamycin was determined to be 3R,4R. Methanolysis of 2 under the same conditions
as 1 gave 4-epi-8 in 43%
yield with 19% of recovered 2. The 1H and 13C NMR spectra of 4-epi-8 were
different from those of natural khatmiamycin. The specific rotation
of 4-epi-8 was [α]D23 +81.6 (c 0.10, MeOH).

Scheme 4 Synthesis of Khatmiamycin (8) and Its 4-Epimer (4-epi-8)
The synthesis of juglomycins
C (3), D (6), and juglomycin C amide (5) is shown in Scheme 5. Oxidation of the naphthalene
ring in 10 with CAN followed by removal of the MOM groups
gave juglomycin C (3). Oxidation of 3 with
hydrogen peroxide in a phosphate buffer (pH = 8.5) afforded juglomycin
D (6). Treatment of 10 with ethyl chloroformate
gave the corresponding mixed anhydride. Without further purification,
the mixed anhydride was reacted with ammonia to afford amide 15. Oxidation of 15 with CAN followed by removal
of the MOM groups gave juglomycin C amide (5). The spectroscopic
data for synthetic 3, 5, and 6 are identical with the reported data.4,7,21

Scheme 5 Synthesis of Juglomycins C (3) and D
(6) and Juglomycin C Amide (5)
The synthesis of the structure
proposed for juglomycin Z (7) is depicted in Scheme 6. Oxidation of the
naphthalene ring in 10 with CAN gave the corresponding
naphthoquinone derivative. Radical
methylation25 of the naphthoquinone by
treatment with silver nitrate and potassium persulfate in the presence
of acetic acid gave 16 in 30% yield over two steps. Removal
of the MOM groups with TFA gave the proposed structure for juglomycin
Z (7) in 34% yield. Unfortunately, the 1H
and 13C NMR spectroscopic data for synthetic 7 do not match those reported for the natural one (Table S1 in the Supporting Information).8 The specific rotation value of synthetic 7 {[α]D28 −44.3
(c 0.10, MeOH)} is completely different from that
of the natural one {[α]D20 +144 (c 0.025, MeOH)}. Synthetic 7 was converted into its methyl ester 19. The 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopic data for synthetic 19 are not identical with those reported for the same compound
derived from natural juglomycin Z (Table S2 in the Supporting Information).8 The specific
rotation value of synthetic 19 {[α]D26 −40.9
(c 0.32, MeOH)} is different from that of the same
compound derived from natural 7 {[α]D20 +37.3 (c 0.01, MeOH)}.

Scheme 6 Synthesis of the Proposed Structure for
Juglomycin Z (7) and Its Methyl Ester 19
Selected carbon atoms have been
labeled using the IUPAC numbering system.

A juglomycin Z isomer 20 and its methyl ester 21 were also synthesized (Scheme 7). Both 20 and 21 have a hydroxyl group at the 8′-position instead of the 5′-position.
The hydroxyl group of 3-bromoplumbagin (22)26 was protected as a MOM ether to give 23. Reduction of the 1,4-naphthoquinone in 23 with sodium
hydrosulfite followed by methylation of two hydroxyl groups in the
resultant hydroquinone gave 24. A Grignard reagent, which
was prepared from 24, was treated with optically active
epoxide 25(22) (>97% ee)
in
the presence of a catalytic amount of CuCN to give 26 in 65% yield. After protection of the hydroxyl group in 26 as a MOM ether, deprotection of the TBS group in 27 with TBAF afforded 28. Oxidation of the primary alcohol
in 28 through Dess–Martin oxidation and Pinnick
oxidation gave carboxylic acid 29. Oxidation of 29 with CAN and deprotection of the MOM group gave 20. Because of the low solubility of 20 in CDCl3, this compound was converted into its methyl ester 21 by treatment with trimethylsilyldiazomethane. The 1H
and 13C NMR spectroscopic data for synthetic 21 do not match those reported for juglomycin Z methyl ester 19 (Table S3 in the Supporting Information).8

Scheme 7 Synthesis of Juglomycin Z Isomer (20) and Its Methyl
Ester 21
Selected carbon atoms
have been
labeled using the IUPAC numbering system.

The results obtained in Schemes 6 and 7 indicate that the structure
proposed for natural juglomycin Z is incorrect. The 1H
and 13C NMR signals at the 4,1′,2′,3′,4′-positions
as well as the methyl group at the 3′-position in synthetic 7 are quite different from those reported for natural juglomycin
Z (Table 1). In particular,
the 1H and 13C NMR signals of the methyl group
at the 3′-position in synthetic 7 (δH = 2.26 ppm; δC = 12.7 ppm) are shifted upfield
in comparison with those reported for 7 (δH = 2.67 ppm; δC = 18.5 ppm). These observations
indicate that natural juglomycin Z does not have a methyl group at
the 3′-positon. The 1H and 13C NMR signals
at the 1′,2′,3′,4′-positions in natural 7 are quite different from those at the 1,2,3,4-positions
reported for bhimamycin E (30)27 and 2-methyl-3-acetoxy-5-methoxy-1,4-naphthoquinone (31).28 Furthermore, the chemical shifts
of the methyl group in natural 7 are quite different
from those derived from the methyl group in the acetyl group in 30 and 31. These spectral comparisons suggest
that natural juglomycin Z does not possess an acetyl or acetoxy group
at the 3′-position. Therefore, the structure for natural juglomycin
Z still remains unclear.

Conclusions
2-Alkyl-1,4-naphthoquinones generally act as electrophiles at their
electron-deficient α,β-unsaturated ketone moieties. On
the other hand, their tautomers, o-quinone methides,
react as both nucleophiles and electrophiles. Natural 1,4-naphthoquinones
undergo several biotransformations by both enzymatic and nonenzymatic
modifications because of their high reactivities. Juglomycins have
remarkable structural diversity by available modifications.7 To date, 11 juglomycins (A–J and Z) have
been isolated and characterized.1,2,4,8,29 Related
natural naphthoquinones such as frenolicins30−32 and nanaomycins33−36 have also been isolated (Figure 2).37 Thus, a divergent synthesis
from a common intermediate will provide easy access to these natural
products.38

B, deoxyfrenolicin, and nanaomycins A
and D.

In this study, we demonstrated
that compound 10 is
a common intermediate for the divergent synthesis of juglomycins and
their derivatives. The most significant feature of the approach described
in this paper is that these natural products can be synthesized through
only two to four steps from the common intermediate 10. Further synthetic studies toward related natural naphthoquinones
and evaluation of the biological activities of synthetic compounds
are currently ongoing in our laboratory.

Experimental Section
General
Information
All solvents and reagents were
used without further purification unless otherwise noted. Analytical
TLC was performed using Silica gel 60 F254 plates (0.25
mm, normal phase) and Silica gel 60RP-18 F254S plates (0.25
mm, reverse phase). Normal phase flash column chromatography was performed
using Silica gel 60 (particle size 40–63 μm; 230–400
mesh ASTM). Reverse phase flash column chromatography was performed
using an octadecyl (C18) silica gel (particle size 20–30 μm).
Melting point (mp) data were uncorrected. Specific rotations were
recorded on a polarimeter and recorded as [α]D values
(concentration in g/100 mL). IR spectra were recorded on an IR spectrometer
using NaCl (neat) or KBr pellets (solid). 1H and proton-decoupled 13C (13C{1H}) NMR spectra were recorded
on an NMR spectrometer (400 and 100 MHz, respectively) using chloroform-d (CDCl3), acetone-d6, dichloromethane-d2 (CD2Cl2), and methanol-d4 (CD3OD) as solvents. Chemical shift values are expressed in δ (ppm)
relative to tetramethylsilane (TMS, δ 0.00 ppm) or the solvent
resonance (CDCl3, δ 7.26 ppm for 1H NMR
and δ 77.0 ppm for 13C NMR; acetone-d6, δ 2.04 ppm for 1H NMR and δ
29.8 ppm for 13C NMR; CD2Cl2, δ
5.32 ppm for 1H NMR and δ 53.7 ppm for 13C NMR; CD3OD, δ 49.0 ppm for 13C NMR).
Data are reported as follows: chemical shift, multiplicity (s = singlet,
d = doublet, t = triplet, br = broad, dd = double doublet, m = multiplet),
coupling constants (J; Hz), and integration. Mass
spectra were obtained by Fourier transformation–ion cyclotron
resonance–mass spectrometry (FT–ICR–MS) using
a spectrometer with electrospray ionization (ESI) or on a high-resolution
double-focusing mass spectrometer using fast atom bombardment (FAB).
Preparative reverse phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)
was performed by the LC-2000 Plus system (pump: PU-2086; UV detector:
UV-2075) with a COSMOSIL 5C18-MS-II Packed Column (20 mm i.d. ×
250 mm). Preparative gel-permeation chromatography (GPC) was carried
out using a LC-2000 Plus system equipped with GPC H-2001 and GPC H-2002
(20 × 500 mm) columns using CHCl3 as the eluent.

at 0 °C. The mixture was stirred at room temperature (rt) for
2 h. The reaction was quenched by the addition of water. The resultant
