Facile
and innovative route for large-scale synthesis of SiO2 fibers
with excellent textural properties and H2O adsorption performance
is presented. At first, a three-dimensional
network of SiO2 precursor fibers was produced from tailored
spun solutions (without any toxic elements and surfactants) by centrifugal
spinning, which is a very modern fiber-synthesis technique, with numerous
advantages over electrospinning. Upon thermal annealing of the precursor
fibers, mesoporous amorphous SiO2 fibers with an ultrahigh
surface area of up to 824 m2/g and pore size distribution
in the range of 2–10 nm were produced. Owing to the high number
of OH groups available on the surface, the produced SiO2 fibers showed significantly better performance in H2O
adsorption compared to that of the reference silicagel.

Introduction
Fibrous structures
have been extensively used for decades in various
filtration applications, catalysis, health care, textile, etc. Within
past 15 years, however, fibers with diameter on the nanometers and
sub-micrometers scale have attracted significant scientific and technological
attention due to their very high porosity and permeability, often
combined with a high specific surface area.1−3 There are essentially
four classes of fibers (including nanofibers) on the basis of their
composition: polymeric,4,5 metal oxide,6,7 metal,8 and hybrid ones.9,10 In particular,
nanofibers and microfibers of amorphous SiO2 have already
shown a potential for capturing air moisture,11,12 as catalyst carriers,13 or part of solid-state
electrolytes of batteries.14 The specific
chemical, electronic, and ionic properties of SiO2 in combination
with high specific surface and three-dimensional (3D) structure of
fibers make fibrous materials highly promising for many other applications.
In general, numerous techniques for production of nanofibers and microfibers
exist, including electrostatic spinning,15,16 centrifugal spinning,17,18 pressurized spinning,19,20 template growth,21 self-assembly,22 phase separation,23 melt-blowing.24 Nevertheless, the most
widely employed technique for these types of fibers has been the electrostatic
spinning, known also as “electrospinning”, which is
based on application of an electrostatic field between the spinnerette
(continuously fed with spun solution) and the collecting electrode
and consequent withdrawal of tiny fibers from the spun solution toward
the collecting electrode.

For an efficient electrospinning process,
the first key step is
the preparation of stable spun solution. There are many different
compositions of spun solutions published in the literature for specific
types of fibers. In particular, for SiO2 fiber synthesis,
spinning solutions usually contain a precursor of SiO2,
carrying polymer, solvent, and frequently also additional stabilizers.
In most of the published papers, tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) was
used as the SiO2 precursor.12,25−36 Numerous carrying polymers were used, including poly(vinylpyrrolidone)
(PVP),25,30,31,33 poly(vinyl alcohol),12,28,35 poly(ethylene oxide),33 or Pluronic F127.12,26,32 When combining the sol–gel method with electrospinning, there
is no need of a carrying polymer.26,27,29,36

Because TEOS
is well soluble in H2O, the H2O-based solutions
were used for sol–gel solution that undergoes
pregelation (aging) of TEOS, which is followed by the main spinning
process.26,27,29,36 The alcohol-based spun solutions usually contain
ethanol and methanol with other solvents like dimethylformamide36 or dimethyl sulfoxide.33 The polymeric reaction of TEOS is driven and stabilized by hydrochloric
acid (HCl),26,33,37 acetic acid,25,34,36 or H3PO4.30 The
specific surface area of fibers can be further increased by addition
of a surfactant into the spun solution, for example, Pluronic F127.26,29,35 Finally, the spun solutions undergo
electrostatic spinning using conditions that strongly depend on the
design of the spinning tool. Most typically, the voltage and the distance
between electrodes are in the range of dozens of kilovolts and 5–20
cm, respectively.

The literature on electrospun SiO2 fibers reports the
mean fiber diameter to be in the range of 100–500 nm. Until
now, there has been no other technique capable of production of fibers
with such small diameters. However, the available literature provides
only limited data on the detailed textural properties. Out of the
eight papers available on electrospun SiO2 fibers,12,26,27,30,32,38−40 five of them contain textural properties. Data from these papers
are summarized in Table S1 in the Supporting
information. Specific surface areas span from 120 to 506 m2/g and porosity of the fibers cover a broad range of microporosity
and mesoporosity depending on the condition of spinning and composition
of the solution. However, electrospinning has also some disadvantages.
From the handling point of view, the most serious problem is the electrostatic
charge of electrospun fibers that causes difficulties for all kinds
of mechanical handling. In addition, some spinning solutions also
contain HCl, which causes a corrosion of the production facility.
On the basis of the recent literature,17,18 it seems that
centrifugal spinning, where no electrostatic charge is involved, not
only overcomes the disadvantages of electrospinning, but is also industrially
upscalable, which is comparably difficult with electrospinning tools.
In addition, the centrifugal spinning processes possess significantly
higher yields (amount of fibers produced per unit of time) than those
of conventional electrospinning processes. The pressurized spinning19,20 further improves the positive yield figure.

To the best of
authors’ knowledge, so far only two synthetic
papers were reported on the preparation of SiO2 fibers
by centrifugal spinning. In the first report, Jung et al.23 utilized TMOS aqueous solution with a surfactant.
Their mesoporous fibers reached a specific surface area of 605 m2/g. This result is also listed in Table S1 along with electrospun SiO2 fibers. In a recent
paper by Ren et al.,41 various nanofiber
and microfiber SiO2 assemblies were reported with fiber
diameters well below 500 nm, which was previously exclusive only to
electrospun fibers. These two papers, however, did not report any
fiber application and used aqueous chlorine containing (corrosive
and environmentally not favorable) spun solution. Thus, it is important
to develop an advanced synthesis of SiO2 fibers by centrifugal
spinning and to exploit these fibers for applications.

In this
work, we aim to contribute to this development. We present
several new features: new spun solution without any chlorine agents,
an optimized centrifugal spinning technique (industrially already
exploited) yielding mesoporous SiO2 fibers with excellent
textural properties, and excellent results of the H2O adsorption.

Results
and Discussion
Morphological and Structural Analysis of
Fibers
Figure 1 shows scanning electron
microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images
of the as-spun and calcined SiO2 fibers. As one can see,
the fiber structure of the as-spun fibers was preserved after calcination.
However, the integrity of the as-spun fibers was not preserved after
calcination due to the volume contraction and gravimetric loss based
on the burn-out of the carbonaceous compounds from the as-spun fibers
(for thermal gravimetric results, see Figure S1 in the Supporting information). In other words, the fibers get shorter
in length and smaller in diameter through the calcination process.
The fibers are completely amorphous in nature, as evident from TEM
images and the selected-area diffraction pattern in Figure 1f, and further corroborated
by X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements (see Figure S2). This is in line with the literature that reports crystallization
of amorphous SiO2 to quartz SiO2 at as high
a temperature as 1200 °C.33

Figure 1 SEM images
of (a, b) as-spun fibers and (c, d) calcined SiO2 fibers,
(e, f) TEM images of calcined SiO2 fibers.
All fibers are prepared from solution TEOS/PVP 1:1. The inset in (f)
shows the selected-area diffraction pattern revealing an amorphous
material.

The diameters of as-spun and calcined
SiO2 fibers are
shown in Figure 2 for
different TEOS/PVP ratios. All fibers were calcined at 500 °C
for 6 h (as in Figure 1). Apparently, there is no clear trend of the increasing TEOS content
on fiber diameters. In general, the diameter of the as-spun fibers
is influenced by numerous factors, such as the type and the shape
of spinnerette1 and composition and viscosity
of the solution.42−45 However, according to the authors experience with the SiO2 fiber production process, the temperature and relative humidity
(RH) of the atmosphere in the spinning chamber influences the properties
and quality of the prepared fibers. However, for the fiber synthesis
presented here, the humidity and temperature of the spinning chamber
were controlled and stable (30% RH and 35 °C). Therefore, the
most important parameter influencing the fiber diameter within this
work remains the absolute amount of TEOS in the precursor fibers.
The largest diameter was observed in the case of TEOS/PVP 1.5:1 solution
(which has 14.25 g of TEOS and 9.5 g of PVP in 100 g of the whole
solution). Apparently, this diameter variation is due to the viscoelastic
properties of the solution (influenced by the TEOS absolute amount)
that for the given and constant size of nozzles within the spinnerette
and the constant rotation speed influence the solution flow through
the nozzles and the resulting diameter of withdrawn fibers. Interestingly,
the measured dynamic viscosities of all four solutions lie in a relatively
narrow range between 290 and 315 mPa s, provided that solutions based
on TEOS/PVP 2:1 are most viscous from all solutions. According to Figure 2, for the given setup
even a small viscosity difference influences strongly the diameter
of as-spun as well as calcined SiO2 fibers. It should be
emphasized at this point that the fiber diameter is solely a consequence
of the solution composition and the used setup (Figure 5). It cannot be influenced otherwise by any
other process condition. It should also be noted that some as-spun
fibers might have smaller diameters than those of calcined fibers
(as apparent from the overlap of scatter bars in Figure 2). It is a natural feature
of fiber production that fibers have a scattered distribution
in fiber diameters. What is most important is that the mean of the
fiber diameter is significantly lower for calcined fibers.

Figure 2 Diameter of
as-spun and calcined SiO2 fibers for different
TEOS/PVP ratios.

Another important aspect
of the inorganic fiber production, especially
in terms of the costs, is the calcination yield. The calcination yield
for fibers was calculated as a ratio of the mass
of calcined SiO2 fibers and the mass of as-spun fibers
× 100%. It resulted into 8, 14, 17, and 25 wt % for fibers made
out of solutions with increasing TEOS content. This is in line with
expectation that the higher the TEOS content in the solution, the
higher the gravimetric yield in terms of residual mass compared to
the mass of as-spun fibers.

Textural Properties
Within preliminary
experiments,
the as-spun fibers were calcined at several different temperatures
(450, 475, 500, 550, 600, and 650 °C). A successful calcination
was considered as such a treatment that led to a snow-white 3D fiber
network (without any apparent carbonaceous residues) after 6 h of
soaking at the given temperature. The lowest temperatures (450 and
475 °C) resulted in gray fibers (which remained gray even for
an extensive calcination time of 24 h). Temperatures from 500 °C
(and higher) with soaking time of 6 h always led to the desired white
product, SiO2 fibers

Table 1 provides an overview of textural properties
of SiO2 fibers produced from all four solutions upon calcination
of as-spun fibers at 500 °C for 6 h. For reference, textural
properties of selected benchmark silicagel were analyzed too. The
textural properties of all materials were derived from N2 adsorption isotherms measured at the temperature of liquid nitrogen
(isotherms are shown in Figures S3 and S4). The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) analysis showed
that the highest total specific surface area and the external surface
area (SBET = 824 m2/g and Sext = 65 m2/g) of the fibers was
obtained in the case of TEOS/PVP 1:1 solution. This solution results
also in the smallest diameter of the fibers (as shown in Figure 2) in good agreement
with the trends in the external surface area. These fibers have also
the largest volume of pores (Vp = 0.547
cm3/g), which is an essential parameter for an efficient
adsorption performance. Fibers from the other solutions have specific
surface areas of no more than 506 m2/g and comparably smaller
pore volumes (at most 0.326 cm3/g), as further shown in Table 1.

character.

Interestingly,
the TEOS/PVP ratio strongly influences the porosity
character of the fibers. Although fibers from the TEOS/PVP 0.5:1 and
1:1 solution exhibit very low volume of micropores, the fibers produced
from the solutions with TEOS/PVP ratios larger than 1 have a distinct
microporous character, as can be documented by pore size distribution
histograms for all fibers displayed in Figure S5. According to the literature, the typical specific surface
areas of SiO2 fibers produced by electrospinning are in
the range of 200–500 m2/g.27,30−32 A paper by Jung et al. reported SiO2 fibers
by centrifugal spinning, with a specific surface area of up to 605
m2/g achieved due to addition of surface active compounds
in the spinning solution.23 It is evident
that SiO2 fibers produced from the solution with the TEOS/PVP
ratio of 1:1 reported here exhibit superior SBET and Vp compared with materials
reported in the literature. On the basis of the textural characteristics
of these fibers, the benchmark type of silicagel (Merck grade 10180)
was selected for comparison of adsorption properties. Silicagel textural
properties are summarized in Table 1, and the adsorption isotherm and pore size distribution
histogram are displayed in Figures S4 and S6, respectively.

Fourier Transformed Infrared (FTIR) Spectroscopy
Analyses
FTIR spectra of the fiber sample (TEOS/PVP 1:1)
and reference silicagel
are presented in Figure 3. The vibration of silanol groups of fresh and degassed samples are
very similar (Figure 3a,c). Both fresh samples (spectra x) exhibit intense bands at 1632
cm–1 assigned to the bending vibration of physically
adsorbed H2O molecules and the broad spectral feature in
the range of 3700–2600 cm–1 caused by H-bonding
of H2O molecules on silanols. The subsequent evacuation
at 200 °C led to H2O desorption, evidenced by a disappearance
of the band at 1632 cm–1 (a triplet of the band
at 1980, 1870, and 1643 cm–1 visible in the spectra
y and z depicted in Figure 4b,d is ascribed to the overtones of skeletal vibrations).
The spectral region of O–H vibrations is dominated by the band
at 3746 cm–1, which is assigned to the terminal
isolated or geminal silanols, whereas the low-frequency tail belongs
to the H-bonded vicinal silanols.

b) and reference silicagel (c, d); x is the fresh sample, y is the

Figure 4 (a) Volumetric adsorption isotherms of H2O vapors on
SiO2 fibers TEOS/PVP 1:1 and benchmark silicagel showing
adsorption and desorption branches. Full points are the adsorption
branch of isotherms and empty points are the desorption branch of
isotherms; (b) difference isotherm obtained by subtraction of the
adsorption branches of both isotherms depicted in (a) (SiO2 fibers (TEOS/PVP 1:1), reference silicagel).

On the basis of the relative comparison of spectra of both
samples,
it is evident that SiO2 fibers contain higher population
of H-bonded Si–OH groups. It can be caused by higher overall
surface density of silanols or formation of silanol clusters or silanol
nests. Calcination of the samples at 490 °C led to disappearance
of the tail caused by dehydroxylation of H-bonded vicinal silanols
which exhibit low stability, as is generally accepted.

In general,
a combination of the high specific surface area, hydrophilicity
(density of surface silanol groups), and pore volume has a strong
influence on the shape of the H2O vapor adsorption isotherm
and adsorption capacity.46−48 On the basis of the differences
in textural properties of SiO2 fibers and reference silicagel,
especially in the pore volume, the differences in the adsorption of
H2O could be expected.

All in all, considering the
performance versus production cost
figure (based on the favorable textural properties and the synthetic
yield), SiO2 fibers from solution TEOS/PVP 1:1 were selected
as optimal for further testing by H2O adsorption isotherms
and FTIR.

H2O Adsorption Performance
Figure 4a displays volumetric adsorption
isotherms of the H2O vapor on SiO2 fibers (TEOS/PVP
1:1) and reference silicagel at 25 °C. Both isotherms belong
to type IV concerning IUPAC classification with a similar character
of the hysteresis loop, proving hydrophilicity of the surface and
the fact that capillary condensation in mesopores is a dominant phenomenon
at higher relative pressures of H2O vapor.

From Figure 4b, it is evident
that the adsorption performance at pressures below p/p0 = 0.4 is almost the same for both
materials. In the middle region (between relative pressures of 0.4
and 0.75), SiO2 fibers overcome silicagel due to the narrower
pore size distribution ranging from 2 to 8 nm (Figure S5b) compared to that of silicagel having pore size
distribution between 2 and 20 nm (Figure S6). Above the relative pressure of 0.75, silicagel can adsorb more
H2O due to the presence of larger mesopores and a slightly
higher total pore volume (see Table 1).

The reason for the strong prevalence of SiO2 fibers
in the range of medium humidities stems from the combination of their
large surface area and steeper increase in the cumulative pore volume
at smaller mesopores. The large area of the hydrophilic surface (see
FTIR spectra of silanol vibration in Figure 3) implies a large number of silanol groups
on the fiber surface through which H2O molecules are adsorbed.
In addition, the pore volume contributes to an additional H2O uptake by capillary condensation taking place in the mesopores.

All in all, the results clearly show that SiO2 fibers
have the potential to be used advantageously for a broad range of
applications, including desiccant wheel dehumidification systems49 and solar-powered adsorption refrigeration.50 Because of the above-mentioned reasons, this
technique allows production of SiO2 fibers on an industrial
scale.

Conclusions
In this article, a novel
type of 3D network of SiO2 precursor
fibers with a high surface area (≈824 m2/g) and
large pore volume was synthesized for the first time by centrifugal
spinning from tailored spun solutions without toxic elements and surfactants.
The optimized conditions for production of these fibers were found
to be the following: utilization of solution with the TEOS/PVP ratio
of 1:1 for centrifugal spinning, drying of as-produced fibers in air
at controlled humidity (30% RH), and subsequent calcination in air
at 500 °C for 6 h. On the basis of the textural characteristics
of SiO2 fibers, the benchmark type of silicagel was selected
for comparison of the H2O adsorption performance. From
this comparison it is evident that SiO2 fibers overcome
silicagel in the humidity region between relative pressures of 0.4
and 0.75 due to a combination of their large surface areas and steeper
increases in the cumulative pore volume in smaller mesopores. SiO2 fibers are highly promising for production on an industrial
scale.

Experimental Details
Preparation of the Spun Solution
The spinning solution
was prepared from two individual solutions. The first solution was
prepared by mixing of 2 g of lactic acid, 4.75–19
g tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS), and 7 g of absolute ethanol. The
second solution was prepared by dissolving 9.5 g of poly(vinylpyrrolidone)
(PVP, Mw = 1 300 000 g/mol)
in a mixture of 43.5–57.75 g of absolute ethanol and 19 g of n-butanol. The solution was stirred until all PVP was dissolved.
Finally, both solutions were mixed together. In total, four different
solutions with different TEOS/PVP ratios (0.5:1, 1:1, 1.5:1, and 2:1)
were prepared. Viscosities of the as-prepared solutions were measured
by a laboratory viscosimeter Maneko VP 1000.

Centrifugal Spinning Process
The recently developed
centrifugal spinning technique was used for the synthesis of fibers
with diameters on the microscale and sub-microscale.17,18 A centrifugal spinning tool, Caltrop Spike Spinner CS18N, developed
and operated by the company Pardam Ltd. (Czech Republic) was used
for the synthesis of the precursor 3D fiber network. The drawing of
the tool is shown in Figure 5.

Figure 5 Schematic drawing of the centrifugal spinning
setup.

To briefly outline the principle
of centrifugal spinning, the solution
is fed through many nozzles within the constantly rotating spinnerette
(of a diameter of approximately 20 cm) at a constant flow rate. Centrifugal
forces (due to rotation) spread out many fibers from the nozzles.
Fibers are being dried from the solvents by an air flow (temperature
and humidity controlled) while flying to the collectors, which are
at a distance of approx. 50 cm from the geometrical center of the
spinnerette. They are removed from collectors at regular periods (after
sufficient amount of material has been collected, typically on the
scale of 10–20 min) and submitted to calcination or analyses.
This setup has several important advantages compared with electrospinning.
The prepared fibers are in a “bulky” form, which allows
for their easier handling. There is no nonwoven textile or aluminum
foil needed for the process as a substrate, which has a positive impact
on costs. The fibers are collected directly on the spacers. Finally,
the as-prepared fibers do not possess an electrostatic charge, which
also improves handling with fibers.

On the basis of preliminary
experiments with solutions of different
TEOS and PVP contents, the rotations of the spinnerette were set to
7000 rpm.

Calcination of the As-Spun Fibers
The prepared precursor
fibers were calcined in a laboratory muffle oven. At first, all fiber
batches were heated up to 300 °C (heating rate 0.8 °C/min)
in ceramic crucibles and were maintained at this temperature for 1
h. Then, the temperature was increased to 500 °C (heating rate
10 °C/min) and maintained there for 6 h. Afterward, fibers were
naturally cooled down to the room temperature.

For the purpose
of adsorption properties comparison, a benchmark silicagel (high purity
grade Merck grade 10180; Sigma-Aldrich) with similar textural properties
was examined as well.

Morphological and Structural Analyses
The morphological
characterization of as-spun as well as calcined SiO2 fibers
was carried out using a field-emission scanning electron microscope
(JSM-7500F; JEOL) and a transmission electron microscope (JEM 2010F;
JEOL). Diffraction analyses of the fibers were carried out using an
X-ray diffractometer (XRD, D8 Advance; Bruker AXE), using Cu Kα
radiation with secondary graphite monochromator and a Na(Tl)I scintillation
detector.

BET Analysis
The textural properties (specific surface
area and pore size distribution) of the SiO2 fibers and
reference silicagel were determined from the N2 adsorption
isotherms. The isotherms were acquired using an ASAP 2020 instrument
(Micromeritics) and evaluated by MicroActive software (Micromeritics).
Before the adsorption measurement, the fibers were carefully degassed
to allow a quantitative removal of the preadsorbed H2O.
Starting at ambient temperature, the fibers were degassed at 110 °C
(temperature ramp of 0.5 °C/min) until the residual pressure
of 1 Pa was attained. After further heating at 110 °C for 1 h,
the temperature was increased (temperature ramp of 1 °C/min)
until a temperature of 200 °C was achieved. The SiO2 fibers were degassed at this temperature under a turbomolecular
pump vacuum for 8 h. This was done to avoid potential structural damage
of the fibers due to surface tension effects and hydrothermal alternation.
The specific surface area was calculated according to the BET method.51 The mesopore and external surface area were
determined by means of a t-plot using the Harkins–Jura
equation for calculation of the adsorbed layer thickness; pore
volume and pore size distribution were determined by the nonlocal
density functional theory approach by using the “N2 @ 77 K” model for cylindrical pores and oxide surface.

H2O Adsorption Measurement
The adsorption
isotherms of H2O adsorbate on selected fibers and reference
silicagel were also analyzed by the ASAP 2020 instrument (Micromeritics).
The sample was activated in the same way as described above for N2 adsorption measurement. H2O adsorption isotherms
were measured in the whole range of % RH at 25 °C using the tempered
box equipped with Peltier elements and a Pt thermoprobe allowing temperature
measurement and control in the range of −5 to 80 °C, with
a precision of 0.1 °C.

Fourier Transformed Infrared (FTIR) Spectroscopy
For
the FTIR experiments, the samples were pressed into self-supporting
wafers with densities of ∼10 mg/cm2 and placed into
the IR cell for transmission measurement connected with the vacuum
line (AABSPEC #2000A multimode system). The samples were in situ activated
(outgassed) in dynamic vacuum (residual pressure < 10–4 mbar) for 10 h at 200 °C or 3 h at 490 °C (with a rate
of temperature increase of 1 °C/min up to 127 °C; then,
30 min at this temperature and a subsequent increase of temperature
with a rate of 5 °C/min up to the targeted temperature). Infrared
spectra (32 scans) were collected at 25 °C (temperature was checked
by the thermocouple embedded into the sample holder) with a resolution
of 2 cm–1 on a Nicolet 6700 FTIR spectrometer equipped
with an MCT/A cryodetector. IR spectra of the empty IR cell were taken
as a background for each measured spectrum. For comparison and quantitative
evaluation of individual measured samples, all spectra were normalized
to unitary wafer surface density of 10.0 mg/cm2 using integral
intensity of skeletal overtones (2080–1740 cm–1) as a benchmark.
