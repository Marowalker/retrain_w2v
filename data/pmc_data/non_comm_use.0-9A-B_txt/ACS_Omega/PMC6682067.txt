In
this paper, recent works on biologically coupled gate field-effect
transistor (bio-FET) sensors are introduced and compared to provide
a perspective. Most biological phenomena are closely related to behaviors
of ions and biomolecules. This is why biosensing devices for detecting
ionic and biomolecular charges contribute to the direct analysis of
biological phenomena in a label-free and enzyme-free manner. Potentiometric
biosensors such as bio-FET sensors, which allow the direct detection
of these charges on the basis of the field effect, meet this requirement
and have been developed as simple devices for in vitro diagnostics (IVD). A variety of biological ionic behaviors generated
by biomolecular recognition events and cellular activities are being
targeted for clinical diagnostics as well as the study of neuroscience
using the bio-FET sensors. To realize these applications, bioelectrical
interfaces should be formed between the electrolyte solution and the
gate electrode by modifying artificially synthesized and biomimetic
membranes, resulting in the selective detection of targets based on
intrinsic molecular charges. Various types of semiconducting materials,
not only inorganic semiconductors but also organic semiconductors,
can be selected for use in bio-FET sensors, depending on the application
field. In addition, a semiconductor integrated circuit device is ideal
for the massively parallel detection of multiple samples. Thus, platforms
based on bio-FET sensors are suitable for use in simple and miniaturized
electrical circuit systems for IVD to enable the prevention and early
detection of diseases.

1 Introduction
Biological phenomena are
interestingly related to behaviors of
ions and biomolecules. This is why biosensing devices that enable
the detection of ionic and biomolecular charges contribute to the
direct analysis of biological phenomena in a label-free and enzyme-free
manner. Potentiometric biosensors such as biologically coupled gate
field-effect transistor (bio-FET) sensors, which allow the direct
detection of these charges based on the field effect, have this capability.
That is, bio-FETs are suitable for use as simple devices for in vitro diagnostics (IVD), which can be used to monitor
a person’s overall health to help cure, treat, or prevent diseases.
Various biological ionic behaviors generated by biomolecular recognition
events (e.g., antigen–antibody interactions, DNA hybridization,
and enzymatic reactions) and cellular activities (e.g., neuronal transmission,
cellular respiration, extracellular acidosis, and autophagy) are being
targeted for clinical diagnostics, as well as the studies of cell
biology and neuroscience, using bio-FET sensors (Figure 1). To realize these applications,
bioelectrical interfaces should be formed between the electrolyte
solution and the gate electrode by modifying artificially synthesized
and biomimetic membranes, resulting in the selective detection of
targets based on intrinsic charges on the gate surface (Figure 1). Various types of semiconducting
materials, not only inorganic semiconductors but also organic semiconductors,
can be selected for use in bio-FET sensors, depending on the application
field (Figure 1).

Figure 1 Conceptual
structure of biologically coupled gate field-effect
transistor (bio-FET).

A solution-gate ion-sensitive FET (ISFET) was proposed for
detecting
ions in biological environments.1 In this
device, an electrolyte solution was assumed to induce the interfacial
potential between the solution and the gate insulator instead of a
metal gate in a metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) transistor, although
it was necessary to use a reference electrode in the solution. A gate
insulator is often composed of oxide or nitride membranes such as
Ta2O5, Al2O3, Si3N4, and SiO2; therefore, hydroxyl groups at
the oxide or nitride surface in a solution undergo the equilibrium
reaction with hydrogen ions through protonation (−OH + H+ ⇄ −OH2+) and deprotonation
(−OH ⇄ −O– + H+)
because the change in the surface charge is detected from the change
in pH based on the principle of the field effect.2,3 This
is why the original ISFET sensor is still utilized as a pH sensor.
Such ISFET sensors mostly have a silicon substrate, but a variety
of semiconducting materials have recently been applied to pH-sensitive
ISFET sensors, which require the gate surface in contact with the
electrolyte solution to be covered by functional groups such as hydroxy
groups, carboxy groups, and amino groups.4−9 For example, a transparent amorphous oxide semiconductor (a-InGaZnO)
was utilized as the channel between the transparent conductive source
and drain indium tin oxide electrodes, on which SiO2 was
thinly coated as the gate insulator, in a pH-sensitive ISFET.7 This transparent ion-sensitive thin-film transistor
(ISTFT) can continuously monitor cellular respiration as a change
in pH while clearly observing cellular morphologies under an inverted
microscope. In accordance with the concept of pH-sensitive ISFET sensors,
ion-sensitive membranes (ISMs) with ionophores were coated as bioelectrical
interfaces on the gate of ISFETs to selectively detect cations (e.g.,
Na+, K+, and Ca2+) or anions (e.g.,
Cl– and F–).10,11 Also, enzyme-immobilized membranes coated on the oxide gate induced
a change in pH, which was detected using a pH-sensitive ISFET sensor
on the basis of enzymatic reactions such as penicillinase–penicillin,
urease–urea, and glucose oxidase–glucose reactions.12−14 Moreover, the concept of direct immunosensing using an ISFET sensor
was proposed for label-free monitoring of antigen–antibody
interactions that overcome classical immunoassay.15 In the case of an immuno-ISFET sensor, antibodies are mostly
immobilized on the gate surface to selectively detect antigens on
the basis of intrinsic molecular charges, but counterions shield these
charges from the gate surface because antibodies are often large.
That is, electrolyte solutions include equal numbers of positive and
negative ions, which results in a neutral condition in the solution.
On the other hand, deviation of the positive or negative charge density
is found in the vicinity of the gate surface depending on the surface
charges, which form a diffusion layer on the gate surface, the thickness
of which is defined as the Debye length. The Debye length in a physiological
solution has been calculated to be less than 1 nm. This means that
a large antibody (>1 nm) will react with an antigen located at
a distance
exceeding the Debye length, which cannot be detected by an immuno-ISFET
sensor.16 The detection limit for immuno-ISFET
sensors affects the development of the entire range of DNA-based ISFET
sensors for single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping and DNA
sequencing based on intrinsic molecular charges.17−30 However, a semiconductor integrated circuit device has achieved
the massively parallel detection of multiple samples such as human
genome sequences.31 Each gate is composed
of a pH-sensitive ISFET, which directly detects the change in pH based
on DNA extension reactions and reads 500–600 base pairs on
a gate. On the other hand, cell analyses with ISFET sensors can also
be realized with a cultured-cell-coupled gate ISFET sensor.32−40 Simply, some ions enter or exit cells through ion channels to maintain
cellular homeostasis and control neuronal activities. These ionic
behaviors based on cellular functions should be detected using cultured-cell-coupled
gate ISFET sensors. In fact, flows of ions (Na+ or K+) that result in the action potentials of neurons32−34 and a change in pH based on cellular respiration35−40 were monitored as the change in the output voltage at the cell/gate
nanogap interface using cultured-cell-coupled gate ISFET sensors.

In this paper, recent works on bio-FET sensors are introduced and
compared to provide an overall perspective based on the above background
on ISFET sensors.

2 DNA-Coupled Gate FETs
2.1 Label-Free DNA Molecular Recognition Based
on Intrinsic Molecular Charges
Single-stranded oligonucleotide
probes are chemically immobilized at the gate surface to enable DNA
molecular recognition using ISFET devices.17−30 Oxide or nitride membranes are often used as the gate insulator,
which have hydroxy groups at the surface in a solution. Silane coupling
reagents, which have reactive groups, are covalently bound to hydroxy
groups at the oxide or nitride gate surface. Then, oligonucleotide
probes, the terminus of which is modified by reactive groups, are
linked with the reactive silane-coupled monolayer at the gate or using
a spacer molecule between them. In a single-stranded DNA probe-tethered
gate ISFET, changes in electrical properties are caused by the change
in the density of molecular charges based on DNA molecular recognition
events such as hybridization. In fact, the electrical detection of
DNA hybridization based on a change in the threshold voltage (ΔVT) was realized using DNA probe-tethered gate
ISFETs in several previous studies.21,22,24,25 ΔVT shifted in the positive direction at a constant drain
current (ID) because the density of negative
charges of the target DNA at the gate surface was increased by DNA
hybridization. Such DNA molecular recognition is believed to have
been realized by bound/free (B/F) separation. This means that the
electrical measurement was performed in the same buffer solution before
and after the DNA molecular recognition event, which contributed to
the evaluation without changing the ionic strength in the solution.

In general, equal numbers of ions with positive and negative charges
exist in an electrolyte solution, but a bias of charges is found near
the gate surface depending on the surface charges. That is, charged
molecules away from the gate surface are assumed to be shielded from
the gate surface by counterions in an electrolyte solution, whereas
those near the gate surface can be recognized from the change in the
interfacial potential between the solution and the gate, which depends
on the change in the concentration of target molecules. The distance
from the gate surface at which molecular detection can occur strongly
depends on the ionic strength in an electrolyte solution and is known
as the Debye length based on an electric double layer (EDL). Ionic
behaviors, which contribute to electrical signals, are often discussed
by considering an EDL composed of two layers: the Stern layer of the
ionic monolayer and the diffusion layer, which balances electrical
forces with ion diffusivity.41−46 As shown in Figure 2a, 17-base target DNA, the length of which was ideally calculated
as 5.78 nm, was detected as a change in threshold voltage of ΔVT = 12 mV owing to hybridization in a 25 mM
phosphate buffer solution,24 where the
Debye length was roughly calculated to be ∼2 nm at most. In
addition, extended DNA molecules with 21–61 bases obtained
by the enzymatic reaction with DNA polymerase were detected as ΔVT in a 25 mM phosphate buffer solution, but
the electrical signals were not quantitatively obtained for the extended
DNA molecules with a base length of over 51 (>17.34 nm), as shown
in Figure 2b.28 This means that there is a limit to the base
length that can be detected with an ISFET sensor. However, the extended
DNA molecules were found to have a linear relationship between ΔVT and the base length up to a base length of
41, despite a Debye length of nm order in the electrolyte solution.
The Debye length from the gate surface may be a rough standard for
elucidating the detection limit of DNA molecules because single-stranded
DNA molecules do not necessarily stand up owing to their flexibility
on the gate surface, and their structure is changed to a helix structure
by hybridization with the target DNA. On the other hand, the ionic
environment around DNA molecules was considered to affect the equilibrium
reaction between hydrogen ions and hydroxy groups at the oxide surface
according to the results of a molecular dynamics (MD) simulation.45 This may mean that biomolecules such as DNA
have a diffusion layer around themselves, although the effect of such
an ionic environment on the electrical signal should also depend on
the ionic strength in the electrolyte solution. That is, various biomolecular
recognition events may be detected as a change in pH at the oxide
gate when the ISFET sensors are used, as shown in Figure 2c. Although the effect of the
ionic environment around biomolecules may still be experimentally
unclear, MD simulation is a good tool for predicting such ionic behaviors
at electrolyte solution/biomolecule/gate interfaces.42,43,45,46

DNA molecular recognition based
on hybridization and extension
reactions contributes to the application of DNA analyses such as single-nucleotide
polymorphism (SNP) genotyping and DNA sequencing in a label-free manner
based on intrinsic molecular charges.24,27−29 SNPs indicate single-base mismatches in genes that are related to
various diseases and drug effects. Here, the control of the reaction
temperature for hybridization allows one base mismatch in genetic
sequences to be discriminated. A double-stranded DNA molecule undergoes
the equilibrium reaction with each single-stranded DNA molecule at
a constant temperature that depends on the base sequence, that is,
the number of GC base pairs. Therefore, the rates of double-stranded
DNA molecules with different base sequences can be compared among
them on the basis of ΔVT when the
measurement temperature is maintained at the melting temperature (Tm) of a specific DNA sequence. In fact, the
blood coagulation factors of genes were targeted for SNP genotyping
with DNA probe-tethered gate ISFETs, where normal or mutant oligonucleotide
probes were chemically immobilized. At Tm for the normal base sequence or the mutant base sequence, the difference
in ΔVT among the normal sample,
the mutant sample, and the mixed sample was found to depend on the
rate of the hybridization reaction.24 In
addition, SNP genotyping was also performed on the basis of the DNA
extension reaction on a DNA probe-tethered gate ISFET (Figure 2d).28 Single-stranded DNA probes, the base length of which was less than
that of the target DNA, were designed for a normal sample and a mutant
sample so as to include one base mismatch at the end, and then the
normal target DNA or the mutant target DNA was hybridized with each
probe while focusing on whether the base at the end of probe molecules
was matched or mismatched with the target DNA after hybridization.
The matched base pair at the end was extended by the enzymatic reaction
with dNTP so that the increase in the density of negative charges
of the extended DNA was detected using the ISFET sensor. On the other
hand, the mismatched base pair at the end did not generate an electrical
signal because there was no extension reaction at the gate. Thus,
SNP genotyping can be realized from the change in the intensity of
the electrical signal of an ISFET based on DNA molecular recognition
events.

2.2 Nonoptical Potentiometric DNA Sequencing
As described in the previous section, DNA extension reactions with
dNTPs on a gate were directly detected using the DNA complex-tethered
gate ISFET sensors. This is why, by extending each substrate (dCTP,
dGTP, dATP, and dTTP) in this order, label-free DNA sequencing based
on intrinsic molecular charges can be realized (Figure 3a).27 The base
sequence of DNA probe molecules tethered at the gate was a complementary
sequence for part of the target DNA, where the nonhybridized sequence
of target DNA should be read without labeled materials. As shown in Figure 3b, values of ΔVT according to the expected base pairs were
obtained following the addition of substrates in the order of dCTP,
dGTP, dATP, and dTTP together with DNA polymerase. The magnitude of
the electrical signals corresponded to that of extended molecular
charges, for example, the signal shift for three bases was assumed
to be about 3 times larger than that for a single base. However, a
limit of detection is expected, that is, “the Debye length
limit”, for DNA molecules with longer base lengths, as described
in the previous section, when extended DNA molecular charges are left
at the gate surface owing to the B/F separation. In 2011, we had a
breakthrough in label-free DNA sequencing with arrayed ISFET devices
based on the complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) process,
which resulted in massively parallel DNA sequencing followed by a
cost-effective and high-speed gene analysis.31 This method was based on the detection of ionic charges, that is,
not negative charges of extended base pairs but positive charges of
hydrogen ions generated by enzymatic reactions as byproducts.31,47 As shown in Figure 3c, a single bead (2 μm) with DNA probes was confined in a 3.5
μm diameter well with the gate, where target DNA molecules were
hybridized on the bead. Then, the polymerase reaction between the
DNA complex and the substrates was performed in the order of dGTP,
dATP, dTTP, and dCTP. The DNA probes were immobilized on acrylamide
beads without being tethered on the gate oxide surface. Therefore,
the hydrogen ions generated as byproducts temporarily concentrated
in the well and then interacted with hydroxy groups at the oxide gate,
although they are expected to have diffused to the outside of the
well in the subsequent extension reaction. The temporal detection
of hydrogen ions should not have been realized without the reaction
well. Sensing wells were arranged in a 50 × 50 array on a chip,
which enabled the massively parallel detection of fragmented DNA sequences,
as shown in Figure 3d. Moreover, Escherichia coli sequencing
with a CMOS chip with 1.2–11 million wells produced sequences
with approximately 50–270 megabases, for example. Thus, the
ISFET, which was used as a pH sensor and had the original structure
of a solution-gate ISFET, was applied to a bioanalytical tool with
a CMOS integrated circuit. This solution-gate ISFET is not good at
detecting large biomolecules owing to the Debye length limit. However,
control of the ionic strength in measurement solutions by B/F separation
and the targeting of small ions, even byproducts and so forth, will
contribute to realizing various potential bioapplications of solution-gate
ISFET sensors. Additionally, the CMOS technology is expected to be
used for massively parallel bioanalysis in the fields of clinical
diagnosis and pharmaceutical discovery.

3 Cultured-Cell-Coupled
Gate FETs
3.1 Cell/Gate Nanogap Interface for Cell Sensing
with ISFET Sensors
Living cells take glucose and oxygen to
yield ATP for energy; then, carbon dioxide as a byproduct is produced
in a series of reactions in cellular respiration. Carbon dioxide dissolves
in a solution, resulting in the generation of hydrogen ions on the
basis of the equilibrium reaction. That is, the culturing of cells
induces changes in pH in the culture medium, with the change in pH
depending on the cellular activity. This is why an ISFET sensor can
detect a change in pH based on a cell culture in real time. Such an
effect of cellular respiration on the change in pH in a culture medium
is expected to be significant and to be directly detected at the interface
between cells and the gate surface, that is, the cell/gate nanogap
interface. Previous works revealed a gap of approximately 50–150
nm at a cell/substrate interface, where focal or nonfocal regions
of contact between membrane proteins and substrates were observed
by total-internal-reflection fluorescence microscopy.48,49 In fact, the phospholipid fluorescein [N-(fluorescein-5-thio-carbamyl)-1,2-dihexadecanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine], which is composed of
a pH-dependent fluorescein and a phospholipid, was inserted into a
cell membrane from the outside (Figure 4a).37 The interfacial pH
at the cell/gate nanogap shifted to the acidic side for living cells
(Figure 4b), which
was higher than that around the cell/bulk solution interface after
replacing the culture medium with a fresh one with sufficient nutrients.
This means that hydrogen ions generated by the reactions in cellular
respiration upon the uptake of nutrients concentrated in the cell/gate
nanogap. Furthermore, these results were verified using the cultured-cell-coupled
gate ISFET sensor in real time.35−40Figure 4c shows ΔVout for cancer and normal cells during cell
culture.39 The culture medium was replaced
with a fresh one at 0 h in this graph. ΔVout for living cells gradually increased after changing the
medium. The positive shift of the electrical signals indicated an
increase in the numbers of hydrogen ions with positive charges in
the source follower circuit, that is, a decrease in pH at the cell/gate
interface; this is because the ISFET sensor used was sensitive to
pH variation. ΔVout was translated
to ΔpH using the pH sensitivity (e.g., 56 mV/pH) based on the
calibration curve, as shown in Figure 4d. The pH responsivity of ISFET sensors ideally follows
the Nernstian response (59 mV/pH at 25 °C). In this case, the
Nernst equation is strictly reflected by the coefficient [β/(β
+ 1)] with parameter β (=2n2NSKa1/2/kTCEDL), where n is
the valence of hydrogen ions, NS is the
site density of hydroxyl groups at the oxide membrane, Ka is the equilibrium constant between hydrogen ions and
hydroxyl groups, k is the Boltzmann constant, T is the absolute temperature, e is the
elementary charge, and CEDL is the capacitance
of the electric double layer.50,51 The site density NS of a Ta2O5 surface was
reported to be about 1015/cm2,52 which was sufficiently high for β/(β + 1) to
be assumed as 1. Therefore, the Ta2O5 film gate
exhibits the ideal Nernstian response. The ΔpH of cancer cells
was several times higher than that of normal cells. This means that
this device enabled the label-free, real-time, and noninvasive monitoring
of microenvironmental pH behavior based on extracellular acidosis
around cancer cells in the long term and in situ. Using the cultured-cell-coupled
gate ISFET, a change in the interfacial pH at the cell/gate nanogap
was also found for embryo activity,35 allergic
responses,36 chondrocyte organization,37 and autophagy38 as
well as canceration, on the basis of cellular respiration.

The illustration shown in Figure 4e shows the conceptual principle of cellular
respiration
detection using a cultured-cell-coupled gate ISFET.39 Some proteins in a culture medium are nonspecifically adsorbed
at the gate surface, to which cells adhere through adhesion proteins.
These proteins prevent other ionic biomolecules from coming in contact
with the gate surface, but smaller hydrogen ions easily bind to the
gate surface through the nonspecifically adsorbed proteins, where
the equilibrium reaction between the hydrogen ions and hydroxyl groups
at the oxide gate contributes to the change in the charge density
at the gate, which depends on pH. That is, cultured-cell-coupled gate
ISFETs should be insensitive to most subsequently generated biomolecules,
which means that nonspecifically adsorbed proteins on the gate suppress
nonspecific signals based on biomolecules contributing to interference,
but are sensitive and selective to ΔpH in accordance with the
Nernstian response. Also, hydrogen ions generated by cellular respiration
concentrate in the cell/gate nanogap, which contributes to the amplification
of electrical signals based on ΔpH. Thus, cultured-cell-coupled
gate ISFET sensors are the most suitable devices for the nonoptical
monitoring of cellular respiration, although it is often considered
that they cannot be used to detect biological components in culture
media or whole-blood samples owing to the Debye length limit. Moreover,
an ISTFT coated on the bottom of a cell culture dish (Figure 4f) monitored cellular respiration
as a change in pH, whereas cellular morphologies were clearly observed
under an inverted microscope.7

Recently,
assisted reproductive technology (ART) has been expected
to be used as a therapeutic method for sterility. Engineers in addition
to obstetricians are expected to ensure the success of ART programs.
For in vitro fertilization (IVF) in ART programs,
how to evaluate embryo quality and how to select an embryo in good
condition are significant problems. Morphological evaluation has been
widely used to rank embryo quality because microscopy analysis is
noninvasive and useful in predicting pregnancy rates.53,54 However, the standard of classification for embryo quality seems
to vary among operators because it is a subjective method. Moreover,
elective single embryo transfer will be recommended in the future
to prevent multiple pregnancies.55 Therefore,
a novel principle for evaluating the quality of a single embryo quantitatively
and noninvasively in real time is required for practical use in ART.
Among the various reported cellular activities, the ISFET sensors
allow the cellular respiration of a single mouse embryo obtained by
IVF to be noninvasively monitored on the gate for about 100 h in real
time, as shown in Figure 4g,h.35 It was found that the frequency
of birth for mouse embryos cultured on the gate, which was composed
of an oxide membrane (Ta2O5), was similar to
that on a conventional cell culture dish. Therefore, the safety of
an embryo cultured on a gate was confirmed by the transplantation
of embryos cultured on the gate into recipient mice. Thus, the quality
of transplantable embryos can be noninvasively evaluated with ISFET
sensors. That is, a platform based on cultured-cell-coupled gate ISFET
sensors is suitable for use as a noninvasive and real-time monitoring
system to evaluate the safety and quality of transplantable cells
in the fields of regenerative medicine and pharmaceutical discovery.

3.2 Neuron/Semiconductor Interfaces
As
shown in the previous section, the live monitoring of cellular respiration
requires a relatively long time of a few days to a week depending
on the cellular function. On the other hand, the action potential
of nerve cells can be monitored in less than a second. As shown in Figure 5a,b, the action potential
of a nerve cell cultured on a SiO2 gate surface was controlled
using a patch clamp pipet.32 Here, the
ionic flow through ion channels (Na+ or K+)
induced by stimulation with intracellular potentials should be detected
at the cell/gate nanogap interface. The output potential of this FET
device was based on the change in the ionic current and depends on
the conductance at the cell/gate nanogap interface. That is, a change
in pH is unlikely to have been found around the interface in a short
time, but the flow of Na+ or K+ through the
ion channel at the cell membrane was detected as a change in the extracellular
potential on the gate, although the oxide membrane is expected to
interact with such cations that contribute to the change in the charge
density at the gate, which depends on the gate surface charge (pKa = 4.5, defined as −log10 Ka, where Ka is the acid dissociation constant) and the concentration
of cations. Such potential detection of neurons was also realized
using nanowire (NW) transistor arrays (Figure 5c,d).56 In particular,
NW–axon junction arrays were integrated and tested in at least
50 “artificial synapses” per neuron, although some concerns
were pointed out about the physical rationale for the sign and amplitude
obtained in the NW recordings.57

(E) is maintained at the ground potential (Ag/AgCl electrode). The
bulk silicon (B), source (S), and drain (D) are held at positive bias
voltages (p-channel FET). The neuron is impaled by a microelectrode
(ME) (Ag/AgCl). Current (ISt) is injected
to stimulate the cell. (b) Single action potential at the electrical
junction of a Retzius cell and FET. The source–drain current ID of the FET and the membrane potential VM, as measured by the ME, are shown. (c) Optical

Here, a chemical rationale for the selective detection
of cations
should also be discussed if a certain cation from nerve cells is required
to be selectively detected. A conventional ISM contributes to the
selective detection of a cation using potentiometric devices.10,11 However, an ISM often includes a plasticizer to disperse ionophores
in the polymer matrix, and this plasticizer may be cytotoxic to not
only living cells cultured on the membrane but also human bodies,
although this may not be a critical problem when devices are placed
on the skin for a certain period (about 30 min).58 Therefore, a biocompatible ISM is highly expected to result
in the selective detection of ions such as Na+, K+, and Cl– based on neuronal functions using cultured-neuron-coupled
gate ISFET sensors. Moreover, a biocompatible ion-sensitive arrayed
NW transistor may enable the high-resolution and highly selective
analysis of a neural network over a long time. This may also be accomplished
by flexible and stretchable electronics59 when well-designed chemical modifications are combined on the sensor
surface.

4 Small-Biomarker Sensing with
Chemically Modified
Gate FET Biosensors
A small biomarker can be a target for
clinical diagnostics. Blood
glucose level is the index used when diabetic patients give themselves
a shot of insulin, which is electrochemically detected using an enzyme
electrode.60−62 On the other hand, cortisol in saliva has recently
been utilized as a stress biomarker to check health conditions using
a colorimetric method based on an enzymatic reaction.63 Although enzymes and antibodies have been utilized in a
wide range of scientific fields and their applications have been recognized
as the global standard, the use of these biomacromolecules is problematic
owing to their lack of stability, high-cost and time-consuming production,
and the difficulty of quality control of their production. Therefore,
an artificial and functional membrane based on a standard concept
should be used as a platform providing molecular recognition sites
for small biomarkers. Moreover, FET-based biosensors can be used to
directly monitor biomolecular charges. Therefore, the enhanced detection
sensitivity is expected even for small biomarkers without labeled
materials, and the detection selectivity for small biomarkers will
be improved by the modification of artificial membranes that selectively
induce molecular charges. That is, a platform based on well-designed
gate FET biosensors may be suitable for a nonoptical and enzyme-free
sensing system to selectively detect small biomarkers.

4.1 Molecularly Imprinted Polymer (MIP) Biointerfaces
Molecular
imprinting is based on a template polymerization technique
involving the copolymerization of a cross-linker and a template molecule
covalently or noncovalently bound to a functional monomer.64,65 After removing template molecules, cavities are formed in the polymer
matrix, which are complementary to the template molecules in terms
of shape and size, and capable of template molecular recognition,
as shown in Figure 6a. An MIP functional membrane is often utilized as a receptor of
a target biomolecule, particularly in the absence of its enzyme and
antibody. Such MIP biointerfaces have been modified on the gate of
FET sensors66−69 as well as electrochemical devices such as impedimetric electrodes70,71 and other label-free biosensors such as quartz crystal microbalance72 and surface plasmon resonance biosensors.73 Among them, vinyl phenylboronic acid (PBA) has
been copolymerized as a functional monomer bound to small biomarkers
based on diol binding in MIP biointerfaces of FET biosensors.67−69 A PBA-MIP-coated gate FET sensor was applied to the selective detection
of glucose molecules, as shown in Figure 6b. In fact, the stability constant (Ka) of PBA with glucose was found to markedly
increase to Ka = 1192 M–1, which was 2 orders of magnitude higher than Ka = 4.6 M–1 obtained by nonelectrical detection
methods.69 In a similar manner, the PBA-MIP-coated
gate FETs were used to selectively detect dopamine and oligosaccharides.67,68 In this application, the Langmuir or multi-Langmuir adsorption isotherm
equation was fitted to the change in surface potential (ΔVout) versus the concentration of the small biomarkers,
considering the change in the density of molecular charges of PBA
(ΔQMIP) caused by the adsorption
equilibrium of the analytes with the vinyl PBA-copolymerized MIP membrane
(SM + PBA ⇄ SM·PBA–). The MIPs used
in these studies included (hydroxyethyl)methacrylate as the main chain
monomer, which were the hydrophilic polymers even before adding small
biomarkers such as glucose. This is the reason why the MIPs generally
include a large number of water molecules, that is, the change in
the permittivity of the MIPs was almost negligible even after adding
small biomarkers such as glucose. It is also because the cross-linking
density in the MIPs was controlled to make them relatively rigid.
Therefore, the swelling rate of the MIPs was relatively low owing
to their intrinsic hydrophilic property and relatively high cross-linking
density, which means that the change in the capacitance of the MIP
membranes (ΔCMIP) was almost negligible.
As a result, ΔVout was estimated
from ΔQMIP on the basis of the equilibrium
reaction between the PBA-based MIP and the small biomarkers, enabling
potentiometric adsorption isotherm analysis.67 In addition, a well-defined polymer film, whose thickness is precisely
controlled by surface-initiated atom transfer radical polymerization,
contributes to the quantitative detection of signals by FET biosensors
and provides valuable information for the fabrication of novel bioanalytical
devices.

4.2 Aptamer-Based Biointerfaces
Aptamer
molecules are widely utilized for biosensors as selective receptors
to target molecules, which are composed of single-stranded oligonucleotides
or peptides.74,75 As long as the sequence of aptamers
is identified by an in vitro selection method termed
systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment,76 aptamer-based biointerfaces are available for
the selective detection of biomolecules as signal transduction interfaces
with biosensors, particularly, in the absence of enzymes and antibodies
for the target biomolecules. However, the isolation of an aptamer
for a specific target may require considerable time and expense. In
fact, aptamer-based biointerfaces have recently been utilized for
the selective detection of biomolecules using solution-gate FET sensors,
and small biomarkers were detected by overcoming the Debye length
limitation.77 The key point in small-biomarker
sensing is that the change in the molecular structure of the aptamer
is caused by its binding to small biomarkers on the gate surface.
Aptamer molecules have negative charges owing to the phosphate groups
on the side chain, such as those in DNA or RNA. These negative charges
should be detected by FET devices on the basis of the same principle
as that of DNA molecular recognition discussed in section 2. For example, the negatively
charged backbones of dopamine aptamers with a stem–loop structure
are expected to move near the gate surface owing to structural reorientation
based on the selective binding of dopamine, which means that the negative
charges of dopamine aptamers are assumed to enter the diffusion layer
that is less affected by counterions (Figure 6c). On the other hand, not all aptamer molecules
necessarily induce negative charges at their backbones near the gate
surface by aptamer–target binding, but the density of such
molecular charges near the gate surface may decrease in some structural
reorientations (a change from the state of lying down to standing
up) (Figure 6d), resulting
in a reverse shift of the electrical signal.

5 Conclusions and Outlook
In the development of novel biosensing
devices, the structural
components of the biological target, the signal transduction interface,
and the detection device must be considered. Most biological phenomena
are closely related to ionic behaviors. This is why the detection
of ionic and biomolecular charges is the key to the direct analysis
of biological phenomena in a label-free and enzyme-free manner. Therefore,
semiconductor-based potentiometric biosensors based on the solution-gate
FET have strong potential as detection devices. A variety of semiconducting
materials can be chosen for use in bio-FET sensors, depending on the
application. What characteristics are required for devices used in
applications? These surely include superior accuracy, stability, sensitivity,
a dynamic range with a limit of detection, selectivity, biocompatibility,
flexibility, transparency, and miniaturization. In particular, the
development of bio-FETs with new materials has recently been reported.7,78−81 Furthermore, such device performances are controlled by introducing
bioelectrical interfaces, which can be formed on the basis of well-designed
polymerization techniques or biomimetic materials, as discussed in Section 4. On the other hand,
hydrogen ions produced or released as a result of biological events
are attractive as a detection target of the bio-FET sensors; that
is, we can use a reliable characteristic of ISFET sensors, namely,
pH responsivity.

To begin with, bio-FET sensors should also
be applied to semiconductor
integrated circuits to measure multiple samples simultaneously. This
is one of the advantages of utilizing semiconductor technology. The
nonoptical DNA sequencing discussed in Section 2 was a breakthrough based on the CMOS technology.
The novel applications expected for arrayed devices also include cellular
analyses and small-biomarker sensing. In this case, an enormous quantity
of detected data is assumed including complicated information; therefore,
the data analysis based on a bioinformatics method may be desirable
according to the omics approach.

The Debye length limit is a
fatal disadvantage of semiconductor-based
biosensors, but some new methods to overcome the problem have been
reported.31,77,81,82 In contrast, the Debye screening effect can be utilized
to suppress electrical signals caused by nonspecific adsorption in
the case of cellular analysis, as described in Section 3. That is, proteins in a culture medium,
which nonspecifically cover the gate surface, prevent other ionic
biomolecules from coming in contact with a gate surface; thus, these
unexpected biomolecules adsorbed on the protein layer are not detected
because their charges are shielded by counterions larger than the
Debye length. As a result, smaller hydrogen ions can be more specifically
detected on the basis of the equilibrium reaction with hydroxy groups
at the oxide gate surface. This principle is also applied at a polymeric
nanofilter biointerface on a gate surface, which prevents low-molecular-weight
molecules acting as sources of interference from approaching the gate
surface, resulting in the suppression of nonspecific electrical signals.83 That is, low-molecular-weight molecules acting
as sources of interference remain at a distance longer than the Debye
length, whereas a target small biomarker reacts with the gate surface
passing through the polymeric nanofilter biointerface.

Platforms
based on bio-FET sensors, which originate from electronics,
are suitable for use in miniaturized and cost-effective systems to
directly measure biological samples in the field of in vitro diagnostics.
