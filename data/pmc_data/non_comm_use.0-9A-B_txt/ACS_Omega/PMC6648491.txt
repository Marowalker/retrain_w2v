Ecological awareness
brought adequate innovations in the corrosion prevention
technology in the last decade. Plant extracts are an interesting category
among them, being the rich source of phytochemicals explored as corrosion
inhibitors in various electrolytic media instead of toxic synthetic
materials. Herein, the most ample tropical plant Mangifera
indica L. leaf (MIL) extract was prepared, and its
antioxidant ability has been utilized for corrosion prevention of
commercial steel in 3.5 wt % NaCl environment. A rich source of polyphenol
content provided excellent anticorrosive property. Corrosion prevention
occurs by forming an insoluble organometallic complex between metal
ions and functional groups in the antioxidants at the metal–electrolyte
interface. A new simple strategy is adopted here to make bio-extract
containing epoxy coating on steel. An MIL-precipitated amorphous silica
hybrid is incorporated in epoxy coating. Electrochemical measurement
demonstrated that the developed coating has a superlative corrosion
inhibition efficiency of 99%. Thus, the present findings demonstrate
a novel environmentally benign, efficient corrosion inhibitor for
steel protection in saline media.

==== Body
1 Introduction
In
the last few decades, the concept of “Green” has
immensely influenced all the areas of science and technology, where
fascination for plant extracts as a metallic corrosion inhibitor has
got significant attention.1 From 1960’s
onward, a large number of synthetic organic compounds have been studied
as anticorrosive materials in which heteroatoms such as C, N, O, and
S were identified to be the prime reason for its corrosion inhibition
ability. The selective adsorption of heteroatoms on the metal surface
developed a metal–electrolyte interface barrier and prevented
corrosion. However, most of these inhibitors were expensive, harmful
to humankind, and nonbiodegradable.2 Therefore,
more attention was given toward the development of naturally derived
environmentally benign organic corrosion inhibitors. Apparently, every
plant contains several active phytochemicals, and they are the ideal
candidates to replace traditional toxic inhibitors.1,3 Reduced
environmental hazards, easy availability, renewability, and simple
extraction procedures made it the suitable one, and the intensity
of works on different plant parts, such as seed, root, fruit, leaf,
and so forth, and on various metals in different electrolytic media
reveals the significance of the go green policy in scientific endeavor.4−14 Literature reports suggest that plant extracts have excellent corrosion
inhibition efficiency, especially leaf extract, because of the presence
of the abundant source of phytochemicals compared to other parts.1

Mangifera indica L. is a major tropical
fruit crop in India. It is reported that the methanol/ethanol extracts
of various parts of mango are a rich source of bioactive compounds
such as polyphenols, flavonoids, and xanthanones,15−17 among which
antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and allelopathic effects of polyphenols
have been extensively studied.18,19 Rocha et al. observed
the combined effect of mango and orange peel extracts for corrosion
inhibition on carbon steel in the acidic medium over a concentration
range of 200–600 ppm. They concluded that polar heterosides
and hydroxyl groups are the leading cause of inhibition property.20 Even though the presence of oxidation-retarding
components can enhance the anticorrosive property of mango leaf extracts,
not much emphasis was given to it in the area of corrosion science.
Apart from Mangifera indica L. leaf
(MIL) extract, a lot of other plant extracts have been employed. However,
an efficient anticorrosive
coat out of it is still limited. Zinc–Cichorium
intybus leaf extract hybrid coat, Gracilaria
edulis extract in epoxy coating, silane-treated Mentha longifolia coat, and soya alkyd nanocomposite
coats are some of the examples.21−24 In light of foregoing studies, the present work focused
on corrosion inhibition on commercial steel (CS) in a marine environment
and its application in coatings.

In this work, the ethanolic
extract of the MIL has been prepared
and tested for anticorrosion efficiency at different concentrations.
Further, the corrosion resistance and inhibition mechanism have been
proved from electrochemical studies and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS) analysis, respectively. The inhibition efficiency of the MIL
extract encouraged its application in epoxy coatings, which was further
achieved by developing an organic–inorganic hybrid. An excellent
efficiency of 99% for the respective coating established the MIL extract
as a worthy, environmentally benign, and anticorrosive material for
steel in marine applications.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Characterization of the MIL Extract
The Fourier transform
infrared (FTIR) spectrum of the ethanolic MIL
extract is shown in Figure 1a. The broad band present at 3334 cm–1 is
attributed to typical −OH stretching vibrations of phenolic
compounds and alcohols. Further, the peak at 1031 cm–1 was assigned to carboxylic acid carbonyl (C=O) groups in
phenolic compounds. Hence, it can be inferred that the MIL extract
must be a rich source of phenolic compounds. Moreover, aliphatic −CH
stretching, C–C stretching vibrations, and −CH bending
vibrations were also observed at 2936, 1612, and 1450–1317
cm–1, respectively.25

ethanolic MIL extract.

In order to identify the major compound present in the MIL
extract,
high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) has been conducted,
and the respective chromatogram is displayed in Figure 1b. A total of 16 peaks have been observed
in the chromatogram, among which 8 major peaks have been identified
by comparing the retention time of the 10 mg/mL—99% ethanolic
MIL extract (Table S1, Supporting Information) with that of the standards shown in Figure S1 (Supporting Information). Chlorogenic acid (3), syringic acid
(4), p-coumaric acid (5), ferulic acid (6), ellagic
acid (7), and cinnamic acid (8) with retention times 23.8, 25.5, 28.17,
28.78, 31.7, and 32.66 min, respectively, were identified, though
some of the peaks remained unknown because of a lack of standards.
Apart from that, the literature reports speculate that peaks 1 and
2 correspond to gallic acid and epigalochatechin with retention times
4.4 and 14.89 min, respectively.18,26 In support
of the FTIR results, the HPLC profile reveals that the MIL extract
contains polyphenol as the affluent source.

2.2 Characterization
of MIL–Precipitated
Amorphous Silica Hybrid
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM)
images of precipitated amorphous silica (PAS) and MIL–PAS hybrid
are shown in Figure 2a,b. The micrograph displayed a smooth texture for PAS without a
specific morphology. Further, hybridization with the MIL extract transformed
the PAS texture into a rough one, indicating the complete capping
of the extract on PAS. Subsequently, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy
(EDS) analysis shown in Figure 2c confirmed the presence of C, N, O, and Si in the MIL–PAS
hybrid and corresponding wt % has been tabulated (Table S2, Supporting Information). Carbon and nitrogen
contents illustrated the organic compounds present in the MIL extract
in which higher concentration of C on Si ensured the complete covering
of MIL on PAS. Hence, the morphological characterization confirmed
the successful formation of the MIL–PAS hybrid.

Figure 2 Field-emission SEM images
of (a) PAS, (b) MIL–PAS hybrid,
and (c) EDS spectrum of the MIL–PAS hybrid.

Thermal responses of PAS, MIL extract, and MIL–PAS
hybrid
have been studied and are displayed in Figure S2 (Supporting Information). PAS have shown a total weight loss
of 24%, where 100–180 °C mass loss corresponds to the
elimination of physically adsorbed water molecules and 600–900
°C mass loss indicate the desorption of surface −OH groups
as well as the removal of structural water molecules.27,28 Two-step weight loss has been observed in the case of the MIL extract
with total 72% decomposition. Evaporation of bound water between 50
and 150 °C followed the volatilization of phytochemicals in the
plant extract at 160–800 °C.29 Moreover, both the constituent thermal decomposition patterns were
observed in the MIL–PAS-5 hybrid plot, from which 5 wt % extract
encapsulation was calculated and proved.

2.3 Anticorrosive
Performance of the MIL Extract
Potentiodynamic polarization
measurements were performed to calculate
kinetic parameters of the corrosion inhibition process on CS specimens
as a function of various concentrations of the MIL extract in 3.5
wt % NaCl. The Tafel plot of bare CS, 100, 200, and 300 ppm MIL extract
is shown in Figure 3a. Weight loss of metal coupons corresponding to corrosion has a
direct relation with current density (Icorr) and an inverse relation with corrosion potential (Ecorr) and polarization resistance (Rp). Icorr, Ecorr, and Rp values were obtained
by extrapolating the Tafel plot, where the anodic and cathodic slopes
were represented as ba and bc, respectively. The corrosion inhibition efficiency (η
%) was calculated as follows14,30 1  where Icorr(CS) and Icorr(MIL) are
the current densities
in the absence and presence of an inhibitor, respectively. The impact
of the MIL extract has significantly reflected in corrosion current
density as well as in corrosion potential. The addition of very low
concentration (100 ppm) extract itself brought a noticeable corrosion
inhibition on CS, viz, decrease in Icorr from 10.9 to 7.9 μA/cm2 and increase in Ecorr from −1.04 to −0.96 V. Simultaneously,
the Rp value of the bare coupon was increased
from 3481 to 4288 Ω cm2. In order to study the effect
of concentration on inhibition efficiency, further experiments were
continued with 200 and 300 ppm extracts. Subsequently, a drastic increase
in Ecorr and Rp to −0.84 V and 14 619 Ω cm2, respectively,
and a decrease in Icorr to 2.3 μA/cm2 were observed for 200 ppm concentration with 78% inhibition
efficiency. Surprisingly, the inhibition efficiency trend was dropped
at 300 ppm concentration, further restricting the use of higher concentration
of the MIL extract. Hence, it can be summarized that the optimum concentration
of the MIL extract on CS was found to be 200 ppm for better corrosion
prevention in the saline environment.

Figure 3 (a) Potentiodynamic polarization curves
and (b) Nyquist diagrams
of bare CS, 100, 200, and 300 ppm MIL extract in 3.5 wt % NaCl.

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy
is a nondestructive tool
to study the anticorrosive performance of materials on a metallic
surface. The measured impedance data were plotted as the Nyquist plot; Figure 3b exhibits the corrosion
performance of 100, 200, and 300 ppm MIL extract toward the CS specimen
in an easy way. In order to measure the resistance and capacitance
values, the spectra were fitted using EC-LabV10.40 software with a
basic electrochemical equivalent circuit (Rs + Qdl/Rct), as shown in the Figure 3b inset, in which Rs is the solution
resistance between the reference and working electrodes, Rct is the charge-transfer resistance existing between
the working electrode–electrolyte interface, and Qdl represents the constant phase element results from
the double-layer capacitance of the nonideal rough metal surface.14 Inhibition efficiency of each concentration
of the MIL extract (η %) was calculated using the equation 2  where Rct(MIL) represents the charge-transfer resistance of various
concentrations
of the MIL extract and Rct(CS) denotes
the charge-transfer resistance of the bare metal.

Fitted electrochemical
data are summarized in Table 1. All the curves obtained from
the complex plot show the same behavior evident from its similar semicircular
plot, but different in area, which was evaluated as the variation
in charge-transfer resistance from a higher to a lower frequency.
CS specimens were efficiently protected from corrosion in the NaCl
environment by the addition of the MIL extract, in which 200 ppm concentration
exhibited a maximum efficiency of 79% with a higher Rct 4280 Ω cm2 and lower Qdl 640 μF cm–2. The high efficiency
of the particular concentration was proposed to be the formation of
a barrier between the metallic surface and corrosive media. Consequently,
this should provide a better corrosion resistance at higher concentration;
unfortunately, the expected trend was found to reverse in experiments.
Impedance data were in good agreement with potentiodynamic polarization
measurements and their unusual behavior was further investigated by
means of XPS surface analysis.

2.4 XPS Surface Analysis of the CS Specimen
XPS was used to identify the surface chemical composition of the
CS specimen and investigate the corrosion inhibition mechanism involved
during the addition of the MIL extract. According to the results obtained
from electrochemical tests, bare CS coupon, 200 ppm MIL extract-adsorbed
coupon having maximum inhibition capacity, and 300 ppm MIL extract-adsorbed
coupon were selected. The same experimental setup as that of electrochemical
tests was adopted, and coupons were vacuum-dried overnight before
the analysis.

Constituent elements having various chemical environments
and oxidation states were examined via XPS curve fitting employing
CasaXPS software. The survey spectrum (Figure S3, Supporting Information) shows that Fe, O, and C are the major
components present in all samples. It is interesting to note that
the peak intensity corresponding to Fe and O varies in the order CS
< 300 ppm < 200 ppm, which indicates the reduction of the corrosion
product in tandem.

Similarly, because of organic molecules present
in the MIL extract,
a sharp peak was observed for C in the extract-adsorbed coupons compared
to bare coupons. Carbon correction was performed for each high-resolution
spectrum. The investigation of XPS spectra of Fe 2p is very complex
and difficult to interpret because of the peak asymmetry, shake-up
peaks, complex multiplet splitting, and spectral overlapping.14,31 Curve fitting of O 1s spectra provided useful information for the
inhibitive mechanism taking place on the metal surface.

The
curve fitting of O 1s spectra of three investigated samples
are shown in Figure 4a,c,e. Three major peaks were deconvoluted at binding energies 529.8
± 0.3 eV (blue), 531.4 ± 0.2 (red), and 532.3 ± 0.3
eV (green) attributed to Fe2O3/Fe3O4, Fe(OH)2/Fe(OH)3/FeO(OH), and
adsorbed water in the oxide layer (Fe2O3·nH2O) related to nonuniform porosity, respectively.14,32−36Figure 4b,d,f displays
Fe 2p spectra in which two major peaks have been identified in all
samples at binding energies 710–711(blue) and 713 ± 0.4
eV (green) which represent Fe2O3/Fe3O4 and peak asymmetry arising from the Fe-oxide band envelope,
respectively.14 Moreover, in spectrum shown
in Figure 4d, an additional
intense peak was detected at 711.3 ± 0.3 eV (red) corresponding
to FeO(OH) species.14,31 The spectral peak area data are
tabulated in Table 2 (total peak area = 100%).

Curve
fitting of O 1s and Fe 2p spectra of bare CS coupons in 3.5
wt % NaCl reveals the presence of typical corrosion products such
as unstable magnetite (Fe3O4) and stable hematite
(Fe2O3), which suggest the conventional corrosion
process. Because of the presence of the MIL extract, a decrease in
iron oxide concentration has been noticed along with the formation
of hydroxides and oxy-hydroxides. The Fe 2p spectra of the 200 ppm
adsorbed metal establish the formation of a specific stable oxy-hydroxide
species FeO(OH) which contribute toward the corrosion resistance.
The results show that there must be a protective mechanism that occurred
at an optimum concentration of the MIL extract involving FeO(OH) between
electrolytes and metal; later, its absence collapses the anticorrosive
mechanism and leads to a fall in resistance.

3 Corrosion Inhibition Mechanism
The major component of the
MIL extract was found out from the FTIR
and HPLC techniques to be polyphenols, which possess hydroxyl and
carbonyl functional groups, having antioxidant property. Interaction
of such structurally complex molecules on the metal surface was difficult
to trace out; however, with the aid of XPS surface analysis, a possible
inhibition mechanism was suggested.

The traditional corrosion
process in the marine environment is
shown in Figure 5a
and the mechanism was described as follows (eqs 3a–3d)3 3a   3b   3c   3d  

Figure 5 (a) Bare CS coupon and
(b) MIL-adsorbed CS coupon in NaCl.

The soluble byproduct HCl in the media initiates pitting
corrosion,
and at the same time, unstable iron hydroxides begin to form an amorphous
oxy-hydroxide (FeO(OH)) layer. Initially, this layer separates the
electrolyte and metal surface, behaving as a diffusion barrier, even
though the chloride attack further ruptures this layer by replacing
hydroxyl/water molecules from FeO(OH) and form a soluble Fe–Cl
intermediate. It will restart metal dissolution and end up accumulating
rust (eq 3e).14,37 The high peak area concentration in XPS for Fe3O4 and Fe2O3 in bare CS strongly supports
this mechanism (Figure 4a,b). 3e  

The incorporation
of the 200 ppm MIL extract reflected from XPS
as reduced peak area percentage for iron oxides and appearance of
the oxy-hydroxide peak are shown in Figure 4c,d. It points out that unlike bare CS, the
iron oxy-hydroxide species somehow remains stable and protects the
metal surface. It leads to the belief that the FeO(OH) passive layer
interaction with Cl– and formation of the soluble
compound has been restricted while the addition of the MIL extract.
It could be because the functional groups −OH and C=O
present in the polyphenols of the MIL extract overtake Cl–, forming an insoluble stable organometallic complex (eq 3f),14,38−41 as shown in Figure 5b. 3f  

It will stabilize the passive layer by further restricting
the
chloride attack, eventually resisting corrosion observed in the electrochemical
analysis. Later, the declining trend in anticorrosion efficiency observed
in electrochemical measurements at higher concentration questioned
the stability of the Fe–organometallic complex. Consequent
extenuation of the FeO(OH) peak in the Fe 2p spectrum established
the possibility of the formation of the soluble organometallic complex
rather than insoluble complex.14 Hence,
the mechanism substantiated that the MIL extract performed as an efficient
green corrosion inhibitor for CS at an optimum concentration of 200
ppm.

4 Application Studies
Anticorrosive performance
of the MIL extract in epoxy coatings
has been studied. In order to overcome the MIL-extract epoxy compatibility
issue, PAS has been utilized as a supportive substrate and an organic–inorganic
MIL–PAS hybrid has been prepared. Further, coatings were developed
by incorporating the MIL–PAS hybrid in the epoxy-polyamide
system. Thickness of the coat was measured using a profilometer to
be 14.9 μm, as shown in Figure S4 (Supporting Information). The electrochemical experiment was conducted
in 3.5 wt % NaCl via potentiodynamic polarization and EIS measurements
by maintaining the same conditions used above as shown in Figure 6, and the corresponding
equivalent circuit is given in Figure S5 (Supporting Information).

Figure 6 (a) Potentiodynamic polarization curves and (b) Nyquist
diagrams
of PAS, MIL–PAS hybrid, and bare epoxy (inset) coat.

PAS is a well-recognized anticorrosive
inorganic material, which
shows very high corrosion resistance when compared to bare epoxy.42−44 Incorporation of the MIL extract raised the anticorrosion performance
of PAS coating, where at 5 wt % MIL, the epoxy coat showed a 1 order
increase in Rct with a drastic positive
shift in Ecorr and 99.15% inhibition efficiency.
The subsequent increment in MIL concentration was found to bring down
the efficiency (Figure S6, Supporting Information), possibly because of coat saturation,23 even though it exhibited better resistance than bare PAS demonstrating
the capability of the particular extract. Experimental results are
summarized in Table 3 to evaluate that very low concentration of the natural organic extract
has exquisitely modified the corrosion performance of chemically synthesized
inorganic PAS. Comparing recent studies on Zn–CIL.L hybrid
coat and silane-treated Mentha longifolia, the MIL–PAS hybrid coat shows an exceptional enhancement
(1000 times) in corrosion resistance.21,23 It substantiates
that metal coating based on the environmentally benign MIL extract
is an excellent candidate for the protection of steel in the marine
environment.

5 Conclusions
The MIL ethanolic extract was prepared in which
the major organic
constituent was identified to be polyphenols. The corrosion resistivity
of the material has been established from the potentiodynamic polarization
and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The maximum efficiency
of 78–79% was obtained at 200 ppm concentration. XPS surface
analysis confirmed the formation of iron oxy-hydroxy (FeO(OH)) species,
which developed the hypothesis on an Fe–polyphenol insoluble
organometallic compound responsible for the anticorrosive property.
Further dip in inhibition efficiency at 300 ppm determined the existence
of a soluble organometallic complex. Application of the extract in
epoxy coatings has been achieved through the MIL–PAS hybrid,
where a maximum efficiency of 99% was observed for 5 wt % extract
loading. The MIL–PAS hybrid simultaneously increased the anticorrosive
performance of PAS and synergistically developed an exceptional environmentally
benign epoxy-based anticorrosive coating over steel in the marine
environment. Moreover, the present hybrid coat exhibited a superior
anticorrosive performance than that of the existing natural organic–inorganic
hybrid coatings.

6 Experimental Section
6.1 Materials and Sample Preparation
MIL was washed, dried
in an air oven at 100 °C, and ground to
a powder form. About 20 g of the powdered sample was soaked in 99%
ethanol in a 200 mL volumetric flask and allowed to stand for 48 h
at room temperature.14 A soaked sample
was filtered and excess solvent was removed by the rotary evaporator.
The dried residue was stored in a vacuum desiccator. Experiments were
performed using CS specimens having chemical composition (wt %) C
= 0.24; Mn = 0.92; Al = 0.03; Si = 0.14; Cr = 0.04; V = 0.10; P =
0.08; Cu = 0.06; and remaining Fe. Coupons were cut into a rectangular
shape with 4 × 3 × 0.2 cm dimension and mechanically abraded
with emery paper grade 220–1000. Before each experiment, metal
specimens were degreased with acetone, dried, and kept in a vacuum
desiccator. NaCl (3.5 wt %, analytical grade) was prepared using distilled
water (pH = 6.8) to mimic the corrosive attack in the marine environment.
MIL extract powder of different concentrations 100, 200, and 300 ppm
was dissolved in 3.5 wt % NaCl. Anticorrosive property of each concentration
has been tested on polished bare CS via electrochemical measurements.

Different weight percentages of leaf extract-loaded MIL–PAS
hybrids were prepared. In brief, the required amount of PAS was dispersed
in MIL ethanolic extract by ultrasonication and kept for 48 h at room
temperature. Subsequently, the excess solvent was removed by a rotary
evaporator and dried. Different wt % of extract loading (2.5, 5, and
7.5 wt %) on PAS were achieved by controlling the initial concentration
of the MIL extract, which are denoted as MIL–PAS-2.5, MIL–PAS-5,
and MIL–PAS-7.5, respectively, and 10 wt % of each MIL–PAS
hybrid was dispersed in n-butanol, to which epoxy
resin and its curing agent polyamide (2:1) were mixed by sonication.
The dispersion was applied on the polished CS specimen by a dip-coating
unit with a dipping rate of 80 mm/min and allowed to cure for 24 h.

6.2 Characterization
The MIL extract
was characterized by HPLC on a prominence UFLC system containing an
LC-20AD system controller and Bruker Alfa-E FTIR. Surface analyses
of the MIL extract-adsorbed mild steel specimens were carried out
using XPS. Data analysis and curve fitting were performed with CasaXPS
software. The photoelectron peak identification was achieved from
literature data. Morphological analysis of PAS and MIL–PAS
hybrid was performed using the SEM JEOL JSM-5600 model. EDS was conducted
to detect the elements present in the hybrid sample using a silicon
drift detector X-MaxN attached with a Carl Zeiss EVO SEM apparatus.
Epoxy coating thickness was measured with a Profilometer. Variation
in weight loss of MIL extract powder, PAS, and MIL–PAS hybrid
was confirmed from the thermogravimetry which was carried out in the
temperature range 30–1000 °C using the Hitachi STA7300
TG-DTA instrument in the nitrogen atmosphere at a heating rate of
5 °C/min.

6.3 Electrochemical Measurements
Electrochemical
experiments were performed in a PC-controlled multichannel potentiostat/galvanostat
(Autolab) having a three-electrode cell using saturated calomel, graphite,
and CS coupon as reference, counter, and the working electrodes, respectively.
A working electrode with a surface area of 1.2 cm2 was
immersed in electrolyte 3.5 wt % NaCl solution. Open-circuit potential
was stabilized for 20 min. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy
was conducted in the frequency range of 105 to 0.01 Hz
and with an ac signal of 5 mV amplitude. Potentiodynamic polarization
curves were obtained at a scan rate of 0.001 mV/S in the polarization
range of ±250 mV with respect to the open circuit potential.
EIS spectra and potentiodynamic polarization curves were analyzed
by Nova 2.1 software. Experiments have been performed with bare CS
specimen in the presence of different ppm concentrations of the MIL
extract and with various concentrations of MIL–PAS hybrid-coated
specimens in the electrolyte. The experiments were repeated thrice
for each concentration.
