Growing antibiotic resistance has
become a major health problem
and has encouraged many researchers to find an alternative class of
antibiotics. Combination therapy (covalent/noncovalent) is supposed
to increase antibacterial activity leading to a decrease in administration
dosage, thus lowering the risk of adverse side effects. The covalent
coupling sometimes leads to instability and loss in the structure
of AMPs. Therefore, herein, we have reported innovative research involving
the noncovalent coupling of melittin (MEL), an antimicrobial peptide
with a series of synthesized less toxic pyrrolidinium-based ionic
liquids (ILs) for which MTT assay was performed. The antibacterial
results of conjugates showed remarkable improvement in the MIC value
as compared to MEL and ILs alone against Escherichia
coli and Staphylococcus aureus. In addition, hemocompatibility results suggested
good selectivity of the noncovalent conjugate as a potential antibiotic
agent. Further, the docking study was employed to acquire the most
favorable conformation of MEL in the presence of ILs. The best possible
complex was further studied using various spectroscopic techniques,
which showed appreciable binding and stability of the complex.

Introduction
The emergence of antibiotic
resistance has become a challenge for
the modern medicine world and has an adverse effect on public health.1 Accelerated growth of antibiotic resistance has
been formulated due to overuse of antibiotic drugs including direct
or indirect intake via medicine, agriculture, and aquaculture.2 Bacterial infection diseases have become a major
problem worldwide especially in hospitals. The increased mortality
rate in hospitals is observed with the reason being severe bacterial
infections due to their suppressed immunity, advanced modern medical
practice, and generation of new multiresistance strains.3 Despite several known antibiotics and technologies,
studying the inhibition of bacterial resistance as well as control
remains a challenge for researchers. Therefore, the development of
effective antibiotics is still a major concern for researchers to
prevent resistance-borne diseases.

Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs)
are natural compounds considered
as a potential therapeutic source of future antibiotics because of
their broad spectrum activity and proposed mode of action, which is
different from those of conventional antibiotics.4 They are effective against a wide range of bacteria, fungi,
viruses, etc.5 AMPs are natural endogenous
polypeptides produced by multicellular organisms to protect a host
from pathogenic microbes. AMPs are also defined as host defense peptides
because of their essential role in constituting the innate immunity
system.6 Melittin (MEL) is found to be
a pharmacological component of bee venom consisting of 26 amino acids
and to exhibit water solubility. Hydrophobic characteristics and a
total charge of +6 at physiological pH are the origin of the antibacterial
property of MEL.7 Previous studies suggested
that MEL binds with the negatively charged membrane of prokaryotic
and eukaryotic cells leading to the disruption of the cell membrane
by pore formation.8 There is an advantage
to choosing AMPs as an alternate of antibiotics as bacteria has a
lower propensity to develop resistance against AMPs as compared to
conventional antibiotics since it would necessitate fundamental alterations
in the lipid composition of the bacterial membranes.9

It is well proven that the combination of antibiotics
works well
against bacterial resistance. Various groups of researchers have tried
several combinations of the peptide with drug or inorganic molecules
to enhance the antibacterial activity of AMPs.10 Modulation of AMPs includes coupling of antibiotics covalently
or noncovalently to increase their synergistic effect. Such combinations
lead to an increase in the efficacy of AMPs and reduction of other
adverse side effects associated with them. A recent study of covalent
conjugation of peptides with imidazole has shown remarkable improvement
in the MIC value and emerged as a promising antimicrobial agent.11 For example, vancomycin was coupled via a CuAAC
(copper-mediated coupling between an azide and alkyne) reaction to
various short peptides such as magainin 2 and its analogs. Interestingly,
the improved MIC value was observed as compared to vancomycin and
magainin 2 alone. The dosage observed was in micromolar, which showed
improved antibacterial activity and was found to be effective against
vancomycin-resistant Enterococci. The MIC value of
the conjugate was less than that of vancomycin alone.12 The covalent conjugate of the broad-spectrum antibiotic
is levofloxacin with indolicidin, a hydrophobic peptide, with an amide
linkage. No remarkable improvement in the activity was observed as
compared to levofloxacin and indolicidin alone.13 Another study involves ubiquicidin (UBI), a cationic peptide
covalently coupled to the typical antibiotic chloramphenicol (CAP).
The obtained combination of the drug showed increased antibacterial
activity as compared to CAP alone, and also the cytotoxicity against
human cells was decreased as compared to CAP.14

Previous studies showed that combination therapy is supposed
to
increase the antibacterial activity of therapeutic drugs leading to
a decrease in the intake dosage consequently minimizing the adverse
side effects. Despite covalent conjugation, another technique of combining
two or more antibiotics could be noncovalent interactions. Noncovalent
interactions involve hydrophobic interactions, van der Waal interactions,
π–π interactions, etc., and have great importance
in drug delivery and drug designing.15 The
beauty of noncovalent conjugates over covalent conjugates is the easy
release of a therapeutic agent without any special physical and thermodynamic
environment.16 Therefore, to improve the
antibiotic potential of MEL, the noncovalent conjugates of pyrrolidinium-based
ILs and MEL were prepared, which may lead to better therapeutic agents
against bacterial resistance.

Ionic liquids (ILs) are molten
salt offering the possibility to
design their structure according to application. The properties of
ILs such as viscosity, miscibility, hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity,
polarity, and, most importantly, their antimicrobial property can
be tuned by changing or modifying the ion substituents or composition.17 These solvents are, therefore, often named “designer
solvents”. During the last decade, ILs have revealed some promising
applications in many areas, including biotechnology and biological
sciences. Their fascinating physicochemical properties made them a
good candidate for developing new therapeutic agents. Several positive
effects of ILs have been found such as in terms of enhanced protein
refolding,18 increased thermal stability,19 drug-delivery vehicles,20 and catalysts in many organic reactions.21 The recent findings showed that ILs based on imidazolium, pyridine,
choline, pyrrole, etc. are extensively studied as therapeutic agents
as they possess antibacterial and antifungal properties because of
the high charge and hydrophobicity in ILs. The toxic effect of ILs,
imidazolium, pyridinium, ammonium-based ILs, etc., limits their use
as therapeutic agents.22 Inspired by the
current literature, if imidazole containing quaternary ammonium cations
exhibits biological activity reported to be toxic,22 we wonder of synthesizing less toxic ILs and their application
in drug development. Aimed at the improvement of biological activity
of AMPs, herein, we disclose the synthesis of pyrrolidinium-based
ILs, which excludes the toxicity factor as it was earlier reported
that pyrrolidinium-based ILs are less toxic as compared to imidazolium,
pyridinium, and ammonium-based ILs.23 Also,
the anionic counterpart plays an important role in the stability and
activity; hence, it is paired with stable and weakly coordinating
anions (e.g., bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonylimide, (CF3SO2)2N–, or NTf3–). The antibacterial property of the series of ILs
and with MEL (noncovalent conjugates) was examined against a couple
of clinically relevant microorganisms. To the best of our knowledge,
the study of the above-discussed interplay and its biological activity
is not reported yet.

Results and Discussion
Synthesis of Pyrrolidinium-Based
ILs
The ILs investigated
in this study consist of a 1-alkyl-1-methylpyrrolidinium-based cation
(where alkyl = butyl, hexyl, octyl, decyl, and dodecyl) and lithiumbis(trifluoromethane)sulfonylimide
as an anion, [PyrCxNTf3–] (detailed synthesis is given in the Experimental Procedure). The synthesized ILs were well characterized
by 1H NMR, 13C NMR, FT-IR, and mass spectroscopies
(detailed spectra are shown in the Supporting Information).

Cytotoxicity Assay
The synthesized
ILs were subjected
to cell toxicity on HEK 293 cell lines using various concentrations
(10–320 μM) as shown in Figure 1. All the ILs showed a good response in terms
of the cell viability as it was evident that, at the lowest concentration,
all the five test samples did not show marked variability in terms
of viability (values range between 70 and 95%), while at higher concentrations,
the viability followed the same trend, and at 160 μM, the viability
for all five ILs was very close to each other (between 70 and 95%);
however, compounds [PyrC10NTf3–] and [PyrC12NTf3–] showed
decreasing cell viability at the highest concentration of 320 μM
as shown in Figure 1. This shows the dosage safety of the ILs to be used for further in vitro and/or in vivo studies. The MTT
assay results obtained were compared with the literature, and it was
found that the synthesized ILs possess lesser toxicity as compared
to imidazolium-based and pyridinium-based ILs, which are extensively
studied nowadays as antimicrobial agents in pharmaceutical industries.23

Antibacterial Activity
Antimicrobial
activity of synthesized
ILs and MEL was assessed against clinically relevant microorganisms,
including E. coli as Gram negative
and S. aureus as Gram positive bacterial
strains. Toxicity against microbes was assessed by determining the
minimum inhibition concentration (MIC) values that are summarized
in Table 2. It was
observed that the MIC value against Gram negative E.
coli was higher than that of Gram positive S. aureus. The difference in the toxicity of ILs
against microbes can be justified based on the structural difference
of cell membranes.24 As already mentioned,
the cell wall of Gram-negative bacteria E. coli comprises two layers, the outer membrane of about 7–8 nm,
rich in negative charge and mainly of lipopolysaccharides, is relatively
thinner as compared to the inner layer of approximately 2–7
nm made up of peptidoglycans. Likewise, the cell wall of Gram-positive S. aureus is made up of a porous peptidoglycan layer
of approximately 20–80 nm, which is interconnected with negatively
charged teichoic acid. Hence, it is expected that the increased hydrophobicity
and high positive charge are more likely to insert into the porous
cell wall and disturb the peptidoglycan layer leading to cell death.
The synthesized ILs are structurally similar to the reported imidazolium-based
ILs containing an ammonium moiety with a positive charge and known
for its antibacterial property.25 ILs tend
to get adsorbed on the surface due to its positive charge and hydrophobic
characteristics. It gets absorbed and enters the cell wall by electrostatic
interactions, leading to cell death. Obtained results show that ILs
with longer alkyl chain lengths, [PyrC12NTf3–], showed greater efficiency as an antimicrobial
agent as compared to the ILs with shorter alkyl chains. The mean MIC
value of each IL is shown in Figure 2 against both microbes. The antibacterial property
of ILs of varying chain lengths follows the trend as reported in the
case of imidazolium-based ILs.11,26

Antibacterial
efficiency of ILs collectively depends on the adsorption
subsequent to the penetration power leading to the alteration in the
permeability of the cell membrane and ultimately cell death. As discussed
above, the bacterial activity increases with lengthening of the alkyl
chain. Therefore, the biological effect of ILs is also related with
surface parameters such as the critical micellar concentration (CMC)
and free energy of adsorption ΔG°ad as listed in Table 1 and Table S1. The critical micellar
concentration (CMC), a physicochemical parameter, shows an opposite
trend when compared with antibacterial activity. Table 1 shows the CMC value that was
found to be decreasing with increasing alkyl chain length obtained
from surface tension measurement; therefore, it can be concluded from
the CMC results that the monomer concentration of ILs at the surface
becomes lower with higher analogues.27 On
the other hand, the value of free energy of adsorption, ΔG°ad, was calculated using eqs S8 and S9
in the Supporting Information where the
negative value of ΔG°ad was
found to be increasing with increasing alkyl chain length (Table 1). The negative value
of ΔG°ad favors the spontaneity
of adsorption. The negative increasing value of ΔG°ad with increasing alkyl chain length suggests the
increasing migration rate of ILs to the cell wall with increasing
alkyl chain length. The maximum antibacterial efficiency against Gram
positive and Gram negative bacteria was found for larger-alkyl-chain
IL, [PyrC12NTf3–]. Thus, the
rate of migration is related to the ability of ILs to easily get adsorb
on the surface of the bacterial cell wall resulting into the increased
antibacterial efficacy of that IL, [PyrC12NTf3–].24

Effect of ILs
on the Antibacterial Property of MEL
For rapid inhibition
of the resistant strain, the effect of ILs on
the antibacterial property of MEL was studied. For each IL, there
was a “critical” concentration needed for maximum microbial
inactivation. The effect of selected concentrations of each ILs, namely,
[PyrC4NTf3–], [PyrC6NTf3–], [PyrC8NTf3–], [PyrC10NTf3–], and [PyrC12NTf3–], on
the antibacterial properties of MEL was examined by monitoring the
inactivation of E. coli and S. aureus. The in vitro study of
MEL alone and in combination with each IL was performed. The addition
of [PyrC4NTf3–], [PyrC6NTf3–], [PyrC8NTf3–], [PyrC10NTf3–], and [PyrC12NTf3–] to MEL considerably improved in vitro antibacterial
activity against E. coli and S. aureus strains compared with MEL alone.

The detectable bacterial effect on E. coli and S. aureus was achieved at an
elevated concentration of MEL, 2.60 and 2.07 μM, respectively,
which involves the maximum possibilities of side effects and toxic
effects more prominently playing. The combination of 1.20 μM
MEL and 50 μM [PyrC4NTf3–] against E. coli as shown in Figure 3a and 150 μM
[PyrC4NTf3–] combined with
1.30 μM MEL against S. aureus in Figure 3b were
tested and showed good results in terms of inhibition of growth. Similarly,
a combination of MEL and [PyrC6NTf3–] was tested, and much improved MIC values were obtained as compared
to the combination of [PyrC4NTf3–] with MEL and MEL alone. Much growth inhibition was observed in
treatment with the combination of 20 μM [Pyr C6 NTf3–] and1.31 μM MEL against E. coli as shown in Figure 4a as well as with 200 μM [PyrC6NTf3–] when combined with 1.29
μM MEL against S. aureus as shown
in Figure 4b.

However, another combination of
MEL with [PyrC8NTf3–] was
tested, which further showed very
good results in terms of MIC values (50 μM solution of [PyrC8NTf3–] combined with 1.23 μM
MEL against E. coli and 20 μM
solution of [PyrC8NTf3–] combined
with 1.36 μM MEL against S. aureus as shown in Figure 5a,b. The combination of 10 μM [PyrC10NTf3–] and 1.22 μM MEL against E. coli and the combination of 20 μM [PyrC10NTf3–] with 1.29 μM MEL
against E. coli and S. aureus as shown in Figure 6a,b, respectively, show good results as compared
to the combination tried with butyl, hexyl, and octyl. Although, all
combinations of ILs showed remarkable results in terms of reduction
of bacterial burden. The best response in terms of the reduction of
bacterial burden as shown in Figure 7a,b was observed at a 105–106 CFU/mL inoculum when susceptible E. coli was treated with a combination of 0.53 MEL and 2 μM [PyrC12NTf3–] and S.
aureus strains with a combination of 0.51 MEL and
10 μM [PyrC12NTf3–]
for 16–18 h.

Figure 7 Showing the effect of [PyrC12NTf3–] concentration on antibacterial activity
of MEL against (a) E. coli and (b) S. aureus.

The obtained results show that, at a much higher concentration,
ILs comprising shorter alkyl chains caused maximum reduction of the
bacterial burden of E. coli and S. aureus strains when treated for 16–18 h.
In contrast, a much higher concentration of ILs was needed for the
inhibition of S. aureus. This may be
due to the tendency of S. aureus to
form biofilms; however, it is the main reason for the development
of multidrug resistance (MDR) of S. aureus.28 A higher concentration for the inhibition
of S. aureus suggests that the longer
alkyl chain length leads to more toxic effects against microbes as
discussed in the earlier section. Other ILs also showed improved antibacterial
activity at low concentrations of ILs (highlighted in bold in Table 3). The decreased MIC
value of MEL against both strains in the presence of [PyrC12NTf3–] showed remarkable improvement
in the bacterial efficiency of combination. The combinations provide
the opportunity to reduce side effects as they lead to an overall
reduction in dosage. A cocktail of two antibiotics is nowadays a current
topic of research to obtain a drug to combat multidrug resistance
(MDR).29 Surface tension parameters help
in reaching the effective mechanism taking place when E. coli and S. aureus are treated with MEL-IL noncovalent conjugates. The unique characteristic
of ILs to get adsorbed on the surface made them a good candidate to
be used as a substitute in antibacterial drug development as discussed
previously based on parameters listed in Table 1.

The combination
of ILs with MEL is one way to overcome MDR strains.
In previous studies, it has been demonstrated that the combination
of MEL with antibiotics helps in the inhibition of bacterial infection
occurring due to MDR.29 The reported combination
of MEL with doripenem (antibiotic) decreased the risk of cytotoxicity
up to 61%.24,30 However, in the present study,
the antibacterial activity results showed the improved antibacterial
efficiency of MEL in the presence of all the ILs specially [PyrC12NTf3–] as a decrease in the
bacterial burden of up to 95% was observed for [PyrC12NTf3–]. The combination of MEL-IL will lead
to a decrease in MEL consumption and may decrease the side effects,
which results in it being a good candidate for treatment of infections
from E. coli and S.
aureus. The increased antibacterial activity of the
MEL-IL conjugate is most likely related to their site of action on
a bacterial cell wall. The MEL-IL conjugate adsorbs more and could
create pores inside the outer membrane of E. coli and S. aureus due to increased hydrophobicity
and a more dispersed charge. This mode of action of ILs likely facilitates
the penetration of MEL to reach the cell wall of bacteria, and at
the next step, the MEL-IL conjugate causes the death of bacteria through
inhibition of growth of bacterial cell membranes. The resistance arises
due to the gene exchange between resistive cells and non-resistive
cells.31 Herein, ILs have a property to
get adsorbed over the surface. Therefore, it can be concluded that
ILs binding with MEL noncovalently increases their ability to be more
adsorbed on the outer membrane of the cell as compared to MEL and
ILs alone leading to faster inhibition of bacterial cells. Due to
increased adsorption efficiency, they also stop the exchange of gene
and plasma between the cells leading to a decrease in the MDR as shown
in Scheme 1. Our results
have some implications for the applied use of AMPs as drugs. The production
of AMPs is currently expensive.32 The broad
synergism observed in our experiment means that combined applications
of AMPs could also reduce the consumption of total AMPs just as in
the immune system, which could eventually reduce the costs of treatment
and toxicity.33 Our finding showed the
enhanced activity of MEL in the presence of all ILs; however, the
best combination was obtained with [PyrC12NTf3–], and it can be considered that it can be helpful
as a drug for treatment of MDR.

Scheme 1 Effect of the MEL-IL Conjugate on
the Bacterial Membrane
Hemocompatibility Assay
Intrinsic fluorescence is generally
used to study the change in the conformation of proteins on the addition
of ligands. Therefore, to investigate the hemocompatibility of synthesized
ILs and their conjugate with MEL, the interaction of MEL and the MEL-IL
complex with human serum albumin (HSA) was performed using absorption,
fluorescence, and CD spectroscopies.34

The fluorescence spectra of pure HSA (5 μM), HSA-MEL, and HSA-MEL
with ILs were recorded as shown in Figure 8b. The fluorescence peak of HSA at 342 nm
is a characteristic peak of tryptophan (Trp) shown in Figure 8b. The intensity increased
on the addition of MEL whereas decreased in the presence of ILs. The
change in fluorescence intensity indicates the interaction taking
place between HSA and the MEL-IL complex. Also, the decrease in fluorescence
intensity refers to the quenching process because of the various interactions
taking place such as complex formation, energy transfer, excited-state
reactions, and collisional quenching. According to the observation,
decreased intensity of HSA may be due to the interaction of HSA with
ILs, most likely by electrostatic interaction, which changes the environment
around the Trp present in HSA leading to lowering of solubility of
Trp as reported recently.35 A similar type
of interaction was also observed with BSA.36 The fluorescence peak of HSA at 342 nm did not show any significant
shift in the presence of MEL or the MEL-IL complex, indicating that
neither MEL nor the MEL-IL complex affects the polarity of Trp. The
absorption band in the range of 200–400 nm is the characteristic
band of the α-helix structure of HSA as shown in Figure 8a. The obtained absorption
peak at 280 nm did not shift in the presence of MEL and ILs at very
low concentrations, [PyrC4NTf3–]: 50 μM, [PyrC6NTf3–]: 25 μM, [PyrC8NTf3–]: 20 μM, [PyrC10NTf3–]: 10 μM, and [PyrC12NTf3–]: 5 μM. This suggests that neither MEL nor ILs affected the
structure of HSA37 and the MEL-IL complex
is hemocompatible, which might help in manufacturing the therapeutic
drug.

Figure 8 (a) Absorption spectra, (b) fluorescence spectra, and (c) CD spectra
of pure HSA and melittin in the presence and absence of ILs at 298
K and pH 7.2.

In addition to this, the far-UV
CD spectra of HSA in the presence
of MEL and ILs were recorded as shown in Figure 8c. The figure clearly shows an increase in
the negative ellipticity of HSA in the presence of MEL both at 208
and 222 nm, which suggests that MEL stabilizes the secondary structure
of HSA. Further, the effect of different ILs on the secondary structure
of HSA in the presence of MEL was studied. It was observed that all
the MEL-ILs stabilize the secondary structure of HSA.34 The results obtained from CD spectra comply with the results
obtained from the other spectroscopic techniques.

Effect of ILs
on the Secondary Structure of MEL
CD
spectroscopy is an extensively used technique to investigate the secondary
structure change in MEL. The far-UV CD spectrum of MEL in the presence
and absence of ILs was recorded to see if there is any influence of
synthesized ILs on the secondary structure of MEL as shown in Figure 9(a-e). The far-UV
CD spectrum showed two minima at approximately 208 nm (π–π*)
and 222 nm (n–π*). The two minima of
208 and 222 nm correspond to the presence of an α-helical conformation
of MEL.38 It is evident from Figure 9 that, in the presence of ILs,
the CD spectra of MEL get shifted toward lower wavelengths and the
depth of the minima also increases. This indicates that MEL undergoes
toward the more folded state with a more helical conformation of MEL.
The value of α-helical content calculated from far-UV CD spectra
results showed an increase, which suggests that the ILs stabilize
the secondary structure of MEL (Table 4). Further, the effect of the varying chain lengths
of ILs on the formation of the α-helical structure of MEL was
analyzed using the far-UV CD spectra. The far-UV CD spectra were used
to calculate the ratio of molar ellipticity at 222 and 208 nm (R = [θ]222/[θ]208).11,39 The value of R of the MEL-IL complex was found
to be approximately equal to the R value associated
with MEL alone, which suggests that the ILs with varied chain lengths
have no significant effect on the formation of the α-helical
structure of MEL.11

Binding Study
Binding studies were performed to investigate
the complex formation (noncovalent conjugate) and the strength of
the complex between ILs and MEL. First, molecular docking was performed
to examine the interactions between ILs and MEL. Like the in vitro study, the computational study also helps in understanding
the interaction taking place between ligands and biomolecules. Initially,
we used the molecular docking technique to predict various binding
sites and the mode of binding.40 The crystal
structure of MEL (PDB ID: 1BH1) is available online. The blind docking
was performed using AutoDock Tools-1.5.6 to examine the interactions
taking place between ILs and MEL. The docking results suggest the
involvement of van der Waals and π–cation interactions
in the binding process where the amino acids Lys23, Arg22, and Ser18
were found to be responsible for van der Waals interactions, whereas
Trp19 is for π–cation interactions. After the complete
run, all the ILs were ranked based on their most possible lowest energy.
A representative conformation of MEL-[PyrC12NTf3–] is shown in Figure 10a,b. The obtained binding energies between
MEL and ILs from molecular docking are listed in Table S2, which appeared to be negative and increased on increasing
alkyl chain length in ILs. The maximum negative energy was obtained
when MEL binds with the IL having a dodecyl-carbon chain length, which
depicts the maximum spontaneity of the complex formation. Thus, according
to the binding energy and orientation, the most favorable compound
selected for binding study with MEL was [PyrC12NTf3–] among all synthesized ILs that show the
highest binding energy. Further, various spectroscopic techniques
were employed to study the conformational change in MEL in the presence
of [PyrC12NTf3–].

Fluorescence spectroscopy is the most versatile
technique to study
the microenvironment change in the vicinity of any fluorophore; therefore,
this technique is widely used to investigate the interaction of the
ligand with biomolecules.40,41 MEL has one aromatic
fluorophore (tryptophan), which plays an important role in the generation
of the fluorescence spectrum due to the presence of π electrons.42 The fluorescence emission was recorded with
the excitation wavelength λexc = 280 nm. The concentration
of MEL (5 μM) was kept constant with varied concentrations of
[PyrC12NTf3–] (from 1.66 to
21.20 μM), Figure S24a shows the
maximum fluorescence intensity (λmax) of MEL observed
at 353 nm. The fluorescence intensity shows a progressive decrease
with the increasing concentration of [PyrC12NTf3–]. Further, no shift in the maximum emission at
298, 303, and 308 K was observed; this indicates that the binding
of [PyrC12NTf3–] components
may not accomplish a conformational change in a particular concentration
range.34 Moreover, the Stern–Volmer
quenching constant, binding constant and number of binding sites were
calculated using eqs S10 and S11 given in the Supporting Information
(Table S3) using Figure 11a,b. The magnitude of Ka indicates the strong interaction of [PyrC12NTf3–] with MEL, whereas the value of n depicts the 1:1 binding between MEL and [PyrC12NTf3–]. With increasing temperature,
the value of the binding constant decreases, which suggests that the
stability of the complex decreases with increasing the temperature.

Stern–Volmer plot and (b) double log plot for quenching
of MEL by [PyrC12NTf3–] at
298, 303, and 308 K and pH 7.2.

Further, to ascertain the binding mode, the thermodynamic parameters
such as free energy change (ΔG), enthalpy change
(ΔH), and entropy change (ΔS) were determined.43 The thermodynamic
parameters were calculated using the van’t Hoff equations (eq S12 in the Supporting Information). Figure S24b shows the van’t Hoff plot
of ln Ka versus 1/T for
the MEL/[PyrC12NTf3–] system.
The values of the slope and intercept obtained from the van’t
Hoff plot were employed to determine the values of ΔH and ΔS. Further, the free energy
of binding, ΔG, was calculated using eq S13 (given in the Supporting Information). The values of thermodynamic parameters are listed
in Table S2. In Table S2, and the negative values of ΔH and
ΔS suggest that the hydrogen bonding and van
der Waal forces are involved in complex formation.44 The negative value suggests that the binding process was
spontaneous. The experimental results were found to be following the
docking results where the binding energy was in a negative value,
which confirms the spontaneity of the complex formation. With an increase
in temperature, the negative value of free energy showed a decrease,
which suggests that, on increasing the temperature, the stability
of the complex decreases.44

Also,
the UV–vis spectrum was recorded as it assists in
collecting the insightful information regarding structural change
and complex formation.45 The UV–vis
spectra of MEL in the absence and presence of [PyrC12NTf3–] were recorded (Figure S25a). MEL possessed a peak of approximately 273 nm. The prominent
absorption spectrum of MEL signifies the presence of tryptophan (chromophore)
residues.41 The increase in the absorption
intensity of MEL with increasing concentrations of [PyrC12NTf3] indicates the complex formation between MEL and
[PyrC12NTf3].46 The
binding constant Ka was also calculated
by a double reciprocal plot between 1/Ao – A versus 1/[PyrC12NTf3–] using eq S19 given
in the Supporting Information by the method described earlier.47 The value of the binding constant was in the
order of 5, which further validates the fluorescence results.

Conclusions
The study concludes with a successful formulation of noncovalent
conjugates of all synthesized pyrrolidinium based-ILs with MEL. The
improvement of the MIC value of MEL in the presence of ILs was observed
against both microorganisms. In this work, we have reported the best
novel antibacterial composition as MEL and [PyrC12NTf3–], which comprises a combination of 0.53
μM MEL + 2 μM [PyrC12NTf3–] against E. coli and 0.51 μM
+ 10 μM [PyrC12NTf3–] against S. aureus, which did not
show any growth after 24 h. The MIC value of noncovalent conjugates
of MEL with [PyrC10NTf3–]
and [PyrC12NTf3–] was improved
as compared to pure MEL and ILs. The noncovalent conjugate suppresses
the dose intake of MEL consequently lowering the side effects associated
with the higher dose and stopping the chances of getting resistant.
We hereby report that the combination of pyrrolidinium-based ILs within
the tested range with MEL will lead to a highly efficient antibacterial
composition possessing a promising antibacterial property. Furthermore,
based on the cytotoxicity results, a lesser toxicity of pyrrolidinium-based
ILs was found as compared to reported ILs. Their combinations with
MEL demonstrating potential application as the eco-friendly antibacterial
material in their tested concentration range. Also, hemocompatibility
assay suggests the compatibility of the MEL-IL conjugate with human
serum albumin. The spectroscopic results including fluorescence, UV–vis,
and CD showed the stability of the complex formed between MEL and
[PyrC12NTf3–] at room temperature.
The noncovalent conjugates of MEL with ILs are still unexplored. Therefore,
the present novel findings will help us to develop antibacterial drugs
in the area of healthcare.

Experimental Procedure
Materials
Melittin
(purity ≥65%), lithium bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonyl
imide (purity ≥95%), tris buffer, and ampicillin salt were
purchased from Sigma Aldrich. 1-Methylpyrrolidine, 1-bromobutane,
1-bromohexane, 1-bromooctane, 1-bromodecane, 1-bromododecane, dichloromethane,
CDCl3, TMS, MgSO4, neutral aluminium oxide,
ethyl acetate, ethanol, and methanol of analytical grade were used
without any further purification. For antibacterial assay, two of
the quality control MTCC strains, namely, Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) (MTCC 87) and Gram-negative Escherichia coli (E. coli) (MTCC 40), were obtained from the microbial-type
culture collection and gene bank (MTCC), CSIR-Institute of Microbial
Technology, Chandigarh, India. MilliQ water was used throughout the
experiments.

Methods
Synthesis of Pyrrolidinium-Based
ILs
Pyrrolidinium-based
ionic liquids [PyrCxNTf3–], x = 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 alkyl chains
containing lithium bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonylimide (NTf3–) as a counterion were synthesized through a systematic
protocol.48 The synthesis process includes
a two-pot synthesis as shown in Schemes 2 and 3 for the preparation
of intermediate ILs followed by metathesis as a second step49 to obtain the desired ILs. All reactions were
carried out under a normal environment. Thin-layer chromatography
(TLC) analysis was carried out at each step to monitor the progress
of the reaction, which was visualized under UV (254 nm) light. 1H NMR (400 MHz) and 13C NMR (100 MHz) results were
recorded in parts per million relative to the signal of standard tetramethylsilane
(TMS). CDCl3 was used as a solvent in 1H NMR
(shown in the Supporting Information as Figures S1, S5, S9, S13, and S17) and 13C NMR (shown in
the Supporting Information as Figures S2, S6, S10, S14, and S18). Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) (shown
in the Supporting Information as Figures S3, S7, S11, S15, and S19) and mass spectra (shown in the Supporting
Information as Figures S4, S8, S12, S16, and S20) were also recorded to further confirm the structure. The melting
point of all solvents used was uncorrected and used as it is.

Scheme 2 Synthesis of Intermediate ILs with Br– as a Counterion
Scheme 3 Metathesis Step: Pyrrolidinium-Based ILs with NTf3– as a Counterion
Step
1: Synthesis of Pyrrolidinium-Based-ILs (Intermediate)
A
series of pyrrolidinium-based ILs were synthesized, [PyrCxBr] (x = 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12)
as shown in Scheme 2. These ILs were synthesized by mixing bromoalkane (5.48 g, 0.04
mol) with 1-methylpyrrolidine (3.4 g, 0.04 mol) followed by the addition
of ethyl acetate (15 mL) in a round-bottom flask. The reaction mixture
was then stirred and refluxed for 48 h at room temperature. After
refluxing, the solvent was evaporated. The synthesized product obtained
after solvent evaporation was further dried under high vacuum at room
temperature to remove any moisture.

Step 2: Anion Metathesis
Step (to Change the Counterion)
Scheme 3 shows the
metathesis step where the obtained product [PyrCxBr–] (2 g, 0.04 mol) was dissolved in
distilled water (70 mL) to change the counterion followed by the addition
of lithium bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonylimide (2 g, 0.006 mol). The
reaction mixture was stirred for 24 h at 80 °C in a round-bottom
flask. After completion of the reaction, the reaction mixture was
allowed to cool at room temperature followed by the addition of distilled
water (50 mL), and then the mixture was obtained by adding a dichloromethane
solvent (100 mL). The obtained organic layer was separated and washed
three times by distilled water and dried using anhydrous CaSO4. The crude product was filtered through neutral aluminum
oxide to remove yellow coloration and precipitation. To obtain the
desired product, the solvent was evaporated using a rotary evaporator.
The obtained product was kept in high vacuum at room temperature to
avoid moisture content.

Cytotoxicity Assay
Cell viability testing was done
using MTT on HEK293 (human embryonic kidney cells). Briefly, 10,000
cells/well were seeded into flat-bottom 96-well plates (150 μL/well)
in triplicate and allowed to attach and grow. The cells were incubated
for 24 h and subsequently treated with varying concentrations of the
compounds ranging from 10 to 320 μM. After 48 h of treatment,
the medium was removed, and cells were incubated with 20 μL
of MTT (5 mg/mL in PBS) in fresh medium for 4 h at 37 °C. Formazan
crystals, formed by mitochondrial reduction of MTT, were solubilized
in DMSO (150 μL/well), and quantification was performed by reading
the absorbance at 540 nm after an incubation period of 15 min on the
iMark microplate reader (Bio-Rad).

Antibiotic Activity
Bacterial
Strains
In brief, each culture was freshly
prepared and grown to the logarithmic phase in LBB under aerobic conditions
at 37 °C in an orbital shaker for 16–18 h. The growth
at 600 nm was monitored using Analytikjena 210 (Germany). The optical
density of the culture was observed at 600 nm. The working concentration
of the inoculum was approximately 106–105 CFU/mL.

Minimum Inhibition Concentration (MIC) Determination
Antibacterial assay was performed to determine the MIC value of MEL,
ILs, and standard drug ampicillin by a twofold serial broth microdilution
method against E. Coli and S. aureus.50 Twofold dilution
of ILs in LBB were prepared keeping the concentration range at 5.23
to 0.005 mM for [PyrC4NTf3–], 5.32 to 0.005 mM for [PyrC6Ntf3–], 2.705 to 0.002 mM for [PyrC8NTf3–], 3.32 to 0.003 mM for [PyrC10NTf3–], and 1.9 to 0.001 mM for [PyrC12NTf3–] and also from 10 to 0.019 μM for standard drug
ampicillin horizontally in 96-well plates followed by the addition
of 10 μL of bacterial suspension whose working concentration
was adjusted to 105–106 CFU/mL. LBB with
and without bacterial inoculum served as the growth (GC) and sterile
control (SC), respectively. Samples were incubated for 16–18
h at 37 °C.51 After incubation, the
optical density at 600 nm was recorded by iMark microplate reader
(Bio-Rad) for each plate. All tests were performed in triplicate for
each experiment for MIC determination.

Effect of ILs on the Antibacterial
Activity of MEL
The in vitro study was performed
to evaluate the
effect of ILs on the antimicrobial activity of MEL. The testing procedure
consists of various concentration combinations of ILs with MEL where
10 μM MEL was twofold serially diluted vertically in a 96-well
plate ranging from 5 to 0.004 μM vertically against E. coli. Likewise, 8.3 μM MEL was twofold serially
diluted vertically in a 96-well plate ranging from 4.15 to 0.03 μM
vertically against S. aureus. Thereafter,
[PyrC4NTf3–] (50, 100, 150,
200, and 250 μM) was added vertically. Subsequently, the experiment
was repeated for [PyrC6NTf3–] (20, 50, 100, 200, and 250 μM), [PyrC8NTf3–] (10, 20, 20, 100, and 200 μM),
[PyrC10NTf3–] (10, 20, 50,
100, and 150 μM), [PyrC12NTf3–] (1, 2, 5,10, and 20 μM). Further, 10 μL of inoculum
of E. coli and S. aureus was added into the separate plate including GC and excluding SC.
The plate was incubated at 37 °C for 16–18 h. Thereafter,
the optical density at 600 nm was recorded by an iMark microplate
reader (Bio-Rad) for each plate. All tests were performed in triplicate
for each experiment.

Hemocompatibility Assay
The mixture
of MEL (10 μM)
was prepared by mixing it with 5 μM HSA. The mixture was incubated
for 30 min at 300 K. Another mixture of peptide-ILs-HSA was prepared
by keeping the concentration of MEL and HSA same and adding varied
concentrations of ILs, [PyrC4NTf3–] (50 μM), [PyrC6NTf3–] (25 μM), [PyrC8NTf3–] (20 μM), [PyrC10NTf3–] (10 μM), and [PyrC12NTf3–] (5 μM). The fluorescence spectra of pure HSA, pure MEL, and
the mixtures were recorded at room temperature by using a Cary Eclipse
spectrophotometer (Varian, U.S.A.) with a 150 W xenon lamp equipped
with a Peltier control temperature device. The excitation wavelength
was 280 nm, and emission was measured from 290 to 500 nm. The slit
width was kept at 5 nm for all the spectral scans. Also, the absorption
was recorded by using an Analytik Jena Specord-250 spectrophotometer
(U.S.A.) for the same set of samples between the absorption range
of 200–400 nm keeping the slit width at 2 nm using a quartz
cuvette of a 1 cm path length.37 Also,
CD spectra of the same samples were recorded on a Jasco-715spectropolarimeter,
equipped with a microcomputer. The instrument was calibrated with d-10-camphorsulfonic acid. All the CD spectra were recorded
at room temperature, 298 K, using a thermodynamically controlled cell
holder attached to a water bath with an accuracy of ±0.1 °C.19

Physicochemical Characterization
Surface Tension
Measurement
The synthesized series
of novel pyrrolidinium-based ILs were physicochemically characterized
by surface tension techniques using DeltaPi-4 (Kibron, Helsinki, Finland),
equipped with four parallel microbalances having a small diameter
(0.51 mm) special alloy wire (probe, cleaned by blazer piezo micro
torch) to analyze the formation of micelles in water.52 The CMC of each synthesized IL was determined using surface
tension at 298 K. Before measurement, the glass vessel was thoroughly
rinsed with chromic acid and deionized water. The aluminum base plate
used was washed thoroughly with distilled water followed by heating
through an alcoholic flame.53 The system
was calibrated using water whose surface tension was 72.8 mN/m at
298 K for three consecutive trials. To determine the CMC of each IL,
the stock solution was prepared and added progressively in a known
volume of water (1 mL). The values of surface tension (γ) were
measured by mixing and then analyzing simultaneously. The same experiment
was performed for each IL. There was no minimum region or hump observed
that reflects the presence of impurities in the solution.52

Fluorescence Spectroscopy
The steady-state
fluorescence
experiments were performed using the same spectrophotometer as described
in the previous section at 298 K. Pyrene, being the most sensitive
fluorescent probe to analyze the change in the microenvironment in
the solution, was used to further confirm the CMC value obtained from
tensiometry. The value of CMC was determined by a steady-state fluorescence
method by using pyrene as a probe.54 The
plot of the ratio of I1/I3 against the concentration ranged from 0.41 to 3.66 mM
for [PyrC4NTf3–], 0.11 to
1.54 mM for [PyrC6NTf3–],
0.27 to 2.22 mM for [PyrC8NTf3–], 0.04 to 0.63 mM for [PyrC10NTf3–], and 0.017 to 0.27 mM for [PyrC12NTf3–].

Binding Study
Molecular docking
was performed to study the binding site and mode
of binding between MEL and synthesized ILs. After the complete run,
according to the binding energy and orientation, the best combination
was selected. The maximum binding energy was found between MEL and
[PyrC12NTf3–], and the most
favorable docking conformation was taken to further study the binding
using various spectroscopic techniques such as UV–vis spectroscopy,
fluorescence spectroscopy, and CD spectroscopy. The UV–vis
and fluorescence spectra of 5 μM MEL was recorded in the absence
and presence of different concentrations of [PyrC12NTf3–] (1.66 to 13.15 μM) using the same
UV–vis spectrophotometer and fluorescence spectrophotometer
as described in the previous section. Further, secondary structural
change in MEL was studied using CD spectroscopy on the same instrument
as used earlier, and various parameters were calculated. For the detailed
methodology, refer to the Supporting Information.
