Paclitaxel (PTX)-loaded
liposomes were developed with the goal
of enhancing the effects of cancer treatment. Although loading substances
into the lipid membrane of liposome cause some destabilization of
the lipid membrane, PTX was nearly exclusively embedded in the lipid
membrane of liposomes, due to its low water solubility. Hydrophobic
drugs can be encapsulated into the inner core of bovine serum albumin
(BSA)-encapsulated liposomes (BSA-liposome) via noncovalent binding
to albumin. Since PTX is able to noncovalently bind to albumin, we
attempted to prepare PTX-loaded BSA-liposome (PTX–BSA-liposome).
The amount of PTX loaded in the BSA-liposome could be increased substantially
by using ethanol, since ethanol increases PTX solubility in BSA solutions
via prompting the binding PTX to BSA. On the basis of the results
of transmission electron microscopy and small-angle X-ray scattering,
PTX–BSA-liposome formed unilamellar vesicles that were spherical
in shape and the PTX was encapsulated into the inner aqueous core
of the liposome as a form of PTX–BSA complex. In addition,
the PTX–BSA-liposome, as well as nab-PTX, showed cytotoxicity
against human pancreatic cancer cells, AsPC-1 cells, in a PTX concentration-dependent
manner. The in vivo antitumor effect of PTX–BSA-liposomes was
also observed in a mouse model that had been subcutaneously inoculated
with pancreatic cancer cells by virtue of its high accumulation at
the tumor site via the enhanced permeability retention effect. These
results suggest that PTX–BSA-liposomes have the potential for
serving as a novel PTX preparation method for the treatment of pancreatic
cancer.

==== Body
Introduction
Paclitaxel (PTX), which
promotes the polymerization of microtubule
proteins and inhibits their disassembly, has been clinically used
for the chemotherapy of pancreatic cancer.1 Since the clinically available PTX preparation, Taxol, contains
Cremophor EL as a solubilizing agent due to its low water solubility
(less than 2 μg/mL), patients who are administered Taxol often
develop Cremophor EL-derived side effects, such as hypersensitivity
(breathing difficulty, reduced blood pressure, and tachysystole) and
neurotoxicity, thus incentivizing research into the development of
alternative PTX preparations that do not involve the use of Cremophor
EL. Liposomes offer significant potential for overcoming this issue
because they can be loaded with both hydrophilic and lipophilic drugs.
Furthermore, it is well known that liposomes with diameter less than
200 nm are able to passively accumulate in solid tumors via the enhanced
permeability retention (EPR) effect.2,3 On the basis
of these facts, numerous attempts have been made to develop PTX-load
liposomes for pancreatic cancer treatment in the basic research field.4,5 However, PTX can stably exist, not in the inner core (aqueous area)
but in the membrane (lipophilic space of a liposome) because of the
hydrophobic properties of PTX even though the substances to be loaded
into the lipid membrane cause destabilization of the lipid membrane.6,7

In a previous study, we reported on the design of a novel
liposome,
a bovine serum albumin (BSA)-encapsulated liposome (BSA-liposome),
with the objective of encapsulating hydrophobic drugs into the inner
aqueous core of the liposome on the basis of the increased water solubility
of hydrophobic drugs as the result of being noncovalently bound to
BSA.8 This novel liposome was superior
due to the encapsulation of hydrophobic drugs into the inner aqueous
core of its structure with good stability and biocompatibility compared
with the liposome without BSA. In addition, BSA-liposomes were observed
to accumulate in an inflammatory lesion in the colon of the experimental
colitis model mice induced by dextran sulfate sodium,9 indicating that the BSA-liposome meets criteria for the
EPR effect.10 Since PTX can noncovalently
bind to albumin,11 BSA-liposome would be
expected to encapsulate PTX into the inner aqueous core of the liposome
and selectively deliver PTX to solid tumor sites via the EPR effect.
However, there were some unfavorable results associated with our previous
study, in that it was not possible to load a sufficient amount of
tacrolimus in the BSA-liposomes, which were used as a model of an
albumin-bound hydrophobic drug, to exert a therapeutic effect in vivo,9 thus indicating that a novel method for increasing
the amount of hydrophobic drug loaded into the BSA-liposomes will
be required for the development of a PTX-loaded BSA-liposome (PTX–BSA-liposome)
that is capable of exerting an adequate therapeutic efficacy in vivo.

In this study, we report on the preparation of PTX–BSA-liposome,
which contains an amount of PTX needed for cancer treatment, and evaluation
of the antitumor efficacy of PTX–BSA-liposome against pancreatic
cancer. For this purpose, we prepared PTX–BSA-liposomes using
ethanol that can promote the binding of hydrophobic drugs to albumin.
We subsequently examined the physicochemical properties and structure
of PTX–BSA-liposome. Finally, we compared the antitumor effects
between the PTX–BSA-liposome and a commercially available PTX
formulation, nab-PTX, against pancreatic cancer in vitro and in vivo.

Results
Solubility
of PTX
As a result of comparison of the
solubility of PTX in ultrapure water, in 20% ethanol, and in a BSA
solution ([BSA] = 200 mg/mL), the solubility of PTX in 20% ethanol
and the BSA solution was approximately 20 and 69 times higher than
that for ultrapure water (Figure 1). Furthermore, the solubility of PTX in a BSA solution
containing 20% ethanol ([BSA] = 180 mg/mL) was synergistically increased
compared to that in a 20% ethanol and BSA solution (approximately
150-fold and 43-fold for the 20% ethanol and BSA solution, respectively).

Effect of Ethanol on BSA
Structure
Structural changes
in BSA in 20% ethanol were evaluated by far-UV circular dichroism
(CD) spectra and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis
(SDS-PAGE). As shown in Figure 2a, the secondary structure in the case of BSA in 20% ethanol
changed slightly compared to that of BSA in ultrapure water (α-helix
content: 67.7 and 61.6%, β-sheet: 8.8 and 9.4%, for BSA in ultrapure
water and BSA in 20% ethanol, respectively). In SDS-PAGE, a strong
single band for BSA in 20% ethanol was observed slightly up from 63
kDa as with BSA in ultrapure water, indicating that polymerization
(aggregation) and fragmentation were negligible (Figure 2b). Furthermore, a small-angle
X-ray scattering (SAXS) analysis showed that BSA molecules do not
form aggregations in a 20% EtOH solution based on the fact that the
small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) profile of BSA solutions in 20%
EtOH reached a plateau at the low q region, which
indicates the presence of monodispersed particles (Figure S1).

Preparation of PTX–BSA-Liposome
The liposomes
encapsulating PTX were prepared by the thin-film hydration method
using PTX-saturated 20% ethanol, BSA solution, and BSA solution in
20% ethanol, and the amount of PTX loading in the liposome was compared.
In accordance with the results of PTX solubility, as shown in Figure 1, the loading efficiency
(LE) of PTX was dramatically increased in the PTX-saturated BSA solution
in 20% ethanol compared to that in the PTX-saturated 20% ethanol and
the BSA solution (Table 1). In addition, the particle size and ζ-potential of the preparations
were also well-regulated with a good polydispersity index (PDI) in
PTX–BSA-liposome prepared by the PTX-saturated BSA solution
in 20% ethanol (Table 1). On the basis of these results, we used PTX–BSA-liposomes
prepared by the PTX-saturated BSA solution in 20% ethanol in further
experiments.

Morphology
Analysis
Transmission electron microscopy
(TEM) images confirm that the PTX–BSA-liposome were unilamellar
vesicles with a spherical shape (Figure 3a). Furthermore, SAXS profiles of the PTX–BSA-liposomes
appeared as a convex curve (Figure 3b), indicating that unilamellar vesicles had been produced.
For PTX–BSA-liposomes, a system composed of some PTX–BSA
molecules entrapped in a template liposome is considered. For a template
liposome, the layers of the inner water phase, the inner PEG chain,
the inner head group of the lipid, the inner cholesterol, the alkyl
chain, the outer cholesterol, the outer head group of the lipid, and
the outer PEG chain are considered.8,12 Thus, we set k = 8 of the multilayer spherical model to describe the
unilamellar PEG-liposomes containing cholesterol (Figure S2). The experiment data were well fitted (Figure 3b), and the obtained
parameters are summarized in Table 2. Furthermore, the calculated values for the volume
fraction of BSA (ηBSA) and PTX–BSA (ηPTX–BSA) were 0.1212 and 0.0488, respectively, indicating
that the BSA and PTX concentrations in the inner aqueous phase of
the liposome are estimated to be 1.74 and 0.23 mM.

Intracellular Uptake of
PTX–BSA-Liposome
To
evaluate the intracellular uptake of PTX–BSA-liposomes, the
BSA and the lipid membrane in BSA-liposome were labeled with fluorescein
isothiocyanate (FITC) and Cy5, respectively. Furthermore, dansyl-l-asparagine (DNSA), which is a fluorescent probe for albumin
and binds to site I of albumin as well as PTX,13 was used as a model drug instead of PTX because PTX is
nonfluorescent and a cytotoxic drug. After incubating fluorescently
labeled BSA-liposomes with AsPC-1 cells for 4 h, all of the fluorescent
substances inside the cell were observed to be highly fluorescent
(Figure 4).

In Vitro Antitumor Study
The antitumor effects of PTX–BSA-liposomes
against AsPC-1 cells were evaluated in vitro. For comparison, nab-PTX,
a commercially available albumin-PTX nanoparticle, was used. As shown
in Figure 5, both the
PTX–BSA-liposomes and nab-PTX exhibited concentration-dependent
cytotoxicity against AsPC-1 cells and nab-PTX exhibited a lower value
of IC50 than PTX–BSA-liposome (IC50;
PTX–BSA-liposome and nab-PTX, for 37.6 and 29.4 nM, respectively, p < 0.01).

In Vivo Tumor Accumulation of PTX–BSA-Liposome in a Mouse
Model that Had Been Subcutaneously Inoculated with Pancreatic Cancer
Cells
The Cy5-labeled PTX–BSA-liposomes were accumulated
in the tumors in a mouse model that had been subcutaneously inoculated
with AsPC-1 cells at 6 h after their intravenous administration, and
strong fluorescence intensity was observed at 24 h after administration
(Figure 6a). Furthermore,
the results of ex vivo measurements of the fluorescence intensity
in the organs showed that the PTX–BSA-liposomes were highly
distributed in tumors compared with other organs, except for the spleen,
at 24 h after administration (Figure 6b), indicating that the BSA-liposomes are capable of
delivering PTX to the tumor site.

In Vivo Antitumor Effect of PTX–BSA-Liposome in a Mouse
Model That Had Been Subcutaneously Inoculated with Pancreatic Cancer
Cells
Since high accumulation of PTX–BSA-liposomes
in pancreatic cancer was confirmed, the antitumor effect of PTX–BSA-liposomes
was investigated in a mouse model subcutaneously that had been inoculated
with pancreatic cancer cells (AsPC-1 cells). As seen in Figure 7a, PTX–BSA-liposomes
suppressed tumor growth compared with saline (p <
0.01) and nab-PTX (no significance). In addition, no decrease in body
weight was observed in any of the mice groups throughout the experiment
(Figure 7b). Moreover,
no change in the number of blood cells (white blood cell (WBC), red
blood cell (RBC), and platelet (PLT)), which reflects the myelosuppression
of PTX side effects, was observed in a mouse model that had been subcutaneously
inoculated with pancreatic cancer cells that had been administered
to PTX–BSA-liposomes and nab-PTX (Table 3).

Discussion
In
the present study, the amount of PTX loaded into the inner aqueous
core of BSA-liposome was increased when PTX in conjunction with a
BSA solution containing 20% ethanol as a hydration solution was used.
Since PTX can theoretically exist in the inner aqueous core of liposomes
in the form of a PTX–BSA complex, the following possibility
would explain the role of contribution of ethanol in increasing the
amount of PTX loaded into BSA-liposomes. A possible reason for this
is that ethanol increased the solubility of PTX, resulting in enhancing
the degree of binding of PTX to BSA in a BSA solution because PTX
needs be present in an aqueous phase for binding to BSA. On the basis
of this principle, ethanol is generally used in protein-binding experiments
as a solubilizing agent for hydrophobic drugs.14 The results reported in this study (Figure 1) are consistent with this hypothesis: (i)
the solubility of PTX in 20% ethanol was approximately 20 times higher
than that for ultrapure water, and (ii) the amount of PTX bound to
BSA increased from 0.5 to 24% when the solvent changed from a BSA
solution in water to a BSA solution containing 20% ethanol, resulting
in the amount of PTX in the BSA solution containing 20% ethanol being
dramatically increased. Thus, the increase in the solubility of PTX
in an aqueous phase by ethanol can be mainly attributed to improving
the binding PTX to BSA, resulting in increased amounts of PTX being
present in the BSA-liposomes.

Although ethanol can improve the
amount of PTX loaded into BSA-liposomes,
a concern exists that the changes in the albumin structure, fragmentation,
and aggregation may have been caused by the presence of ethanol.15,16 In industry, the method of Cohn is classically used as an ethanol-based
manipulation (the use of 40% ethanol) for purifying albumin from plasma,17,18 suggesting that albumin would have tolerance in ethanol solution
up to 40%. In fact, the present study showed that the secondary structure
of BSA was nearly completely preserved without any aggregations and
fragmentations when a 20% ethanol solution was used (Figures 2 and S1). Furthermore, it is also a concern that the presence of ethanol
may have an effect on the binding of PTX to BSA. In a previous study,
Li et al. reported the possibility that ethanol (0.7–24.7%
vol/vol) may have had an effect on the interaction of ochratoxin A
with albumin.19 Since ochratoxin A and
PTX both bind to site I of albumin, the presence of ethanol may also
affect the interaction between PTX and BSA.20 Further studies related to this issue will be needed. In addition,
it is also possible that ethanol may have had an effect on lipid bilayer
formation in the liposome due to the fact that phospholipids and cholesterol
are soluble in ethanol. On the basis of morphological observations
by TEM, PTX–BSA-liposomes prepared using a BSA solution containing
20% ethanol had a spherical shape and contained unilamellar vesicles
(Figure 3a). Furthermore,
SAXS analysis data were well-fitted with the 8-layer model (the layers
of the inner water phase, inner PEG chain, inner head group of lipid,
inner cholesterol, alkyl chain, outer cholesterol, outer head group
of lipid, and outer PEG chain) (Figure 3b and Table 2), corroborating the conclusion that PTX–BSA-liposomes
form not multilamellar vesicles but unilamellar vesicles that are
spherical in shape. These findings suggest that ethanol would have
negligible effects on lipid bilayer formation in PTX–BSA liposomes.

We also evaluated the antitumor effect of PTX–BSA-liposomes
against pancreatic cancer in vitro. As a comparison, we used nab-PTX
(Abraxane)21,22 and albumin-PTX nanoparticles
that were approved by the FDA in 2013 for the treatment of metastatic
pancreatic cancer when used with gemcitabine.23,24 In the in vitro study, PTX–BSA-liposomes showed concentration-dependent
cytotoxicity against AsPC-1 cells but the IC50 value of
PTX–BSA-liposome was higher than that of nab-PTX (Figure 5). Chatterjee et
al. reported that pancreatic cancer cells recognize albumin and this
facilitates the uptake of nab-PTX via caveolin-1.25 In addition, Davidson et al. reported that pancreatic cancer
cells take up albumin more efficiently than normal pancreatic cells
to consume albumin as a source of nutrients.26 On the other hand, PEG-modified liposomes, like PTX–BSA-liposomes,
have a hydration layer on the surface of the liposome, which results
in inhibiting cellular uptake.27,28 In the present study,
confocal images clearly showed that DNSA–BSA-liposomes are
taken up by AsPC-1 cells in the form of intact BSA-liposomes (Figure 4). In addition, the
pretreatment of cytochalasin D (an inhibitor of micropinocytosis pathway)
resulted in significant inhibition of the cellular uptake of Cy5-labeled
BSA-liposomes by AsPC-1 cells but a filipin pretreatment (an inhibitor
of the caveolae-mediated pathway) did not (Figure S5). Considering these findings, nab-PTX was rapidly taken
up by cells via the caveolae-mediated pathway whereas PTX–BSA-liposome
was taken up, not via the caveolae-mediated but by the micropinocytosis
pathway due to the inhibition by the hydration layer that was formed
by the PEGylation of the surface, thus causing a higher IC50 value for the PTX–BSA-liposomes.

Although PTX–BSA-liposomes
showed lower antitumor effects
against AsPC-1 cells than nab-PTX in the in vitro study, the in vivo
study showed that the PTX–BSA-liposomes had a higher antitumor
efficiency compared with nab-PTX in a mouse model that had been subcutaneously
inoculated with pancreatic cancer cells (Figures 6a and 7a). It was
reported that macromolecules, including PEG-liposomes, passively accumulate
in solid tumors via the EPR effect,2,3 indicating
that PTX–BSA-liposomes would be expected to accumulate in tumors
by virtue of this effect. To achieve a strong EPR effect, macromolecules
are required to meet the following three criteria: (i) molecular size
with a negative charge (less than 200 nm in diameter), (ii) biocompatibility,
and (iii) adequate retention in the systemic circulation.29 In the case of PTX–BSA-liposomes, the
physicochemical properties of the PTX–BSA-liposomes were well
controlled at ca. 150 nm with slight negative charge (Table 1). In addition, our previous
study showed that BSA-liposomes possess good biocompatibility with
nonhematologic toxicity and hepatic and renal injury associated with
them.8 Furthermore, on the basis of SAXS
analyses, we estimate that the surfaces of BSA-liposomes are completely
covered with PEG chains. As a result, the BSA-liposomes can avoid
being captured and degraded by the mononuclear phagocyte system and
acquire a stealth effect (the long blood retention).8 These characteristics would be expected to confer on PTX–BSA-liposomes
a high accumulation property at the tumor site via the EPR effect
in AsPC-1 bearing mice. In fact, the in vivo accumulation of PTX–BSA-liposomes
in the tumor site was observed starting 6 h after administration in
AsPC-1 bearing mice (Figure 6a). On the other hand, it was reported that blood retention
for nab-PTX was insufficient due to the fact that its particle morphology
was unstable in vivo,30 indicating that
nab-PTX would be limited to tumor accumulation via the EPR effect.
On the basis of these facts, it would be likely that PTX–BSA-liposomes
exerted a higher therapeutic efficiency against pancreatic cancer
in vivo than nab-PTX.

There are differences between the present
study and the report
by Wei et al., which is a research concept similar to the present
study.31 They designed thermosensitive
liposomes encapsulating both an antitumor drug (PTX)–albumin
complex and an antipancreatic stellate cell drug–albumin complex,
which they referred to as TSL/HSA-PE. This liposome showed good tumor
penetration properties in a three-dimensional tumor spheroid containing
pancreatic cancer in vitro and a strong antitumor effect in pancreatic
cancer-bearing mice. As compared with the report by Wei et al., the
present study revealed the BSA structure after encapsulation into
liposomes and the structure of the PTX–BSA liposome was fully
characterized. Furthermore, the PTX–BSA-liposomes developed
in the present study exhibited in vivo antitumor effects when a 10
times less amount of PTX dose than TSL/HSA-PE (0.5 PTX mg/kg twice
a week and 5 PTX mg/kg every 3 days, for PTX–BSA-liposome and
TSL/HSA-PE, respectively) was administered. However, experimental
conditions in our study were not the same as those in the study conducted
by Wei et al., such as the kind of pancreatic cancer cells and lipid
components of liposome. Since both liposomes are promising carriers
of PTX for the treatment of pancreatic cancer, further evidence will
need to be collected.

In conclusion, the amount of PTX loaded
in the inner aqueous core
of BSA-liposomes can be increased by using ethanol as a solubilizing
agent by virtue of enhancing the degree of noncovalent binding of
PTX to BSA. In addition, PTX–BSA-liposomes have antitumor efficacy
against pancreatic cancer with high tumor accumulation in a mouse
model that had been subcutaneously inoculated with pancreatic cancer
cells. Thus, the preparation method of PTX–BSA-liposomes established
in this study would be useful information on the development of a
novel type of liposomes that contains both encapsulated drug and BSA.

Methods
Chemicals
HEPC and DSPE-PEG2000 were obtained
from NOF Co. (Tokyo, Japan). Cholesterol was obtained from Nacalai
tesque (Kyoto, Japan). BSA was purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. (St.
Louis, MO). PTX and FITC were obtained from Wako Pure Chemical Industries
(Osaka, Japan). Cy5-cholesterol was synthesized according to a previously
published procedure.9

CD Spectra
Far-UV CD spectra (200–250 nm) were
recorded with a Jasco-720 spectropolarimeter (Tokyo, Japan), as reported
previously.8

SDS-PAGE
SDS-PAGE
analysis was performed as reported
previously.8 Samples (10 μL, [BSA]
= 100 μg/mL) were loaded into a 12.5% polyacrylamide gel and
detected by staining with Coomassie Blue R-250. Gel images were recorded
using a Bio-Rad GS-800 calibrated densitometer.

Evaluation
of PTX Solubility in Different Solutions
The solubility of
PTX in a 20% ethanol solution and a 200 mg/mL BSA
solution containing 20% ethanol was evaluated, as previously reported
with minor modifications.8 A saturated
solution of PTX in 100% ethanol (2 mL) was added dropwise into either
ultrapure water (8 mL) or to a 200 mg/mL solution of BSA (8 mL), resulting
in the final concentration of ethanol in each solution of 20%. These
solutions were stirred at room temperature for 5 min and then centrifuged
at 20 000g for 10 min to remove the deposited
PTX. The supernatant in the BSA solution was deproteinized using acetonitrile
and centrifuged at 20 000g for 10 min. The
PTX concentration in both solutions was analyzed using high-performance
liquid chromatography (HPLC), as reported previously.8

Preparation of PTX–BSA-Liposome
PTX–BSA-liposomes
were prepared by the thin-film hydration method, as reported previously,
but with minor modifications.8 In short,
the thin film composed of HEPC, cholesterol, and DSPE-PEG2000, with a molar ratio of 12:6:1 was hydrated with PTX–BSA solution
containing 20% ethanol ([BSA] = 180 mg/mL). The liposome size was
regulated by passing the particles through polycarbonate membranes
(400 and 100 nm). Unencapsulated PTX and BSA were removed by ultracentrifugation
(150 000g for 2 h). The physicochemical characteristics
(particle size, PDI, and ζ-potential) were determined by dynamic
light scattering (ELS-Z2; Photal Otsuka Electronics, Osaka, Japan).
The concentration of PTX in the PTX–BSA-liposome was determined
for use in subsequent experiments as follows: the PTX–BSA-liposome
solution was deproteinized using acetonitrile and centrifuged at 20 000g for 10 min. The concentration in the supernatant was determined
using HPLC, as reported previously.8

TEM
Liposomes were stained by 2% (w/w) ammonium molybdate.
TEM images were observed with a FEI Titan Themis at 200 kV, as previously
reported.32

SAXS
SAXS measurements
were carried out at BL-40B2
of the synchrotron radiation facility SPring-8 (Hyogo, Japan) with
a 1 m camera using a Rigaku imaging plate (30 × 30 cm2, 3000 × 3000 pixels) as the detector. The exposure time was
300 s, and the wavelength of the beam was 1 Å. A quartz capillary
cell (2 mm diameter; Hilgenberg GmbH) was used for all measurements.
A model of a PTX–BSA-liposome is considered wherein a number
of PTX–BSA molecules are entrapped in liposomes as a template,
as illustrated in Figure S1.(33) A PTX–BSA-liposome is modeled with the
following equations  

where N, v, and η are the number of molecules
in a liposome, the volume
of one molecule, and the volume fraction of molecules in an inner
phase of a liposome, respectively. Plip(q), PBSA(q), and PPTX–BSA(q) are the form factor of a liposome, BSA, and PTX–BSA, respectively,
and given as described in the Supporting Materials and Methods.

Cell Experiments
AsPC-1 cells from
a human pancreatic
cancer cell line were cultured in RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with
10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics (100 U/mL penicillin, 100 mg/mL
streptomycin). Cells were maintained at 37 °C under an atmosphere
of 5% CO2. For evaluating the intracellular uptake of drug-loaded
BSA-liposome, BSA and the lipid bilayer of BSA-liposome were labeled
with FITC and Cy5-cholesterol, respectively. In addition, DNSA, a
fluorescent probe of albumin, was used as a model of an albumin-bound
drug. For the cellular uptake test of DNSA–BSA-liposomes, AsPC-1
cells were seeded in poly-lysine-coated glass bottom culture dishes
(φ = 35 mm; Matsunami Glass Ind., Ltd.) at a cell density of
2 × 105 cells per dish and cultured for 24 h. The
cells were then incubated with DNSA–BSA-liposomes ([DNSA] =
4 μg/mL) at 37 °C for 4 h. The culture medium was then
removed and cells were washed thrice with cold PBS (−) and
then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 5 min at room temperature.
Confocal images were obtained by confocal laser fluorescence microscopy
(LSM510META, ZESS, Germany).34 Excitation
and emission wavelengths were used as follows: 405 and 420–480
nm for DNSA, 488 and 530–600 nm for FITC, and 633 and 636–690
nm for Cy5, respectively. For evaluating the antitumor effect of PTX–BSA-liposome
and nab-PTX, the AsPC-1 cells were seeded in a 96-well cell culture
plate at a cell density of 5000 cells per well and cultured overnight.
The cells were then incubated with PTX–BSA-liposomes ([PTX]
= 0.1–1000 nM) and nab-PTX ([PTX] = 0.1–1000 nM) for
72 h. Cell viability was determined using a cell counting kit-8 (Dojindo
molecular technologies, Inc., Japan), and the half maximal inhibitory
concentration (IC50) was calculated. The cell viability
(%) was calculated using the following equation  

Animals
BALB/cSlc-nu/nu mice (male, 5 weeks) were obtained
from Japan SLC, Inc. (Shizuoka, Japan). The animals were housed in
a room in which stable conditions were maintained (18–24 °C,
40–70%) with a standardized light/dark cycle. They were allowed
free access to food and drinking water. The animals were treated in
accordance with the NIH guidelines. All animal experiments were reviewed
and approved by the Animal Care and Use committee of Sojo University
(Permit #: 2017-P-014).

In Vivo Biodistribution of PTX–BSA-Liposomes
in a Mouse
Model That Had Been Subcutaneously Inoculated with Pancreatic Cancer
Cells
Five BALB/cSlc-nu/nu mice were inoculated with 2 ×
106 AsPC-1 cells subcutaneously into the left back of the
mice. When the tumor volume reached about 200 mm3, mice
were injected with Cy5-labeled PTX–BSA-liposome (0.5 mg PTX/kg)
via their tail vein. After a predetermined time (30 min, 6, 12, and
24 h), biodistribution images were acquired using an IVIS Lumina XR
instrument (PerkinElmer Inc., Waltham, MA). After the final imaging,
the mice were sacrificed and organs (tumor, liver, kidneys, spleen,
heart, lungs, and pancreas) collected and the ex vivo fluorescence
intensity of Cy5 in the organs measured. The tumor volume (V) was calculated according to the formula V = 0.5 × L × W2, where L is the largest tumor diameter and W is the smallest tumor diameter.35

In Vivo Antitumor Study of PTX–BSA-Liposome in a Mouse
Model That Had Been Subcutaneously Inoculated with Pancreatic Cancer
Cells
The mouse model was subcutaneously inoculated with
pancreatic cancer cells (tumor volume; 50–100 mm3). They were randomly assigned into three groups and intravenously
administered by either saline, PTX–BSA-liposome (0.5 mg PTX/kg),
or nab-PTX (0.5 mg PTX/kg) twice a week, and the body weight and tumor
volume were monitored during the course of the treatment. At 64 days
after the first treatment, the mice were sacrificed and their blood
collected. The blood cell numbers (WBC, RBC, and PLT) were then assessed
using an animal blood cell counter (MEK-6458; NIHON KOHDEN Corp.,
Tokyo, Japan).

Statistics
All data are expressed
as the mean ±
SD statistical analyses for multiple comparisons in the study were
determined by the analysis of variance (two-way ANOVA) followed by
the Bonferroni analysis. A probability value of p < 0.05 was considered to be significant.
