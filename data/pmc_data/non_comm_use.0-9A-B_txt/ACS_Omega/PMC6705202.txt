Ion correlation and fluctuation can
play a potentially significant
role in metal ion–nucleic acid interactions. Previous studies
have focused on the effects for multivalent cations. However, the
correlation and fluctuation effects can be important also for monovalent
cations around the nucleic acid surface. Here, we report a model,
gMCTBI, that can explicitly treat discrete distributions of both monovalent
and multivalent cations and can account for the correlation and fluctuation
effects for the cations in the solution. The gMCTBI model enables
investigation of the global ion binding properties as well as the
detailed discrete distributions of the bound ions. Accounting for
the ion correlation effect for monovalent ions can lead to more accurate
predictions, especially in a mixed monovalent and multivalent salt
solution, for the number and location of the bound ions. Furthermore,
although the monovalent ion-mediated correlation does not show a significant
effect on the number of bound ions, the correlation may enhance the
accumulation of monovalent ions near the nucleic acid surface and
hence affect the ion distribution. The study further reveals novel
ion correlation-induced effects in the competition between the different
cations around nucleic acids.

1 Introduction
Nucleic
acids (DNAs and RNAs) are highly charged polyanions. The
folding of nucleic acids involves metal ion binding, which causes
charge neutralization and screening of Coulomb repulsion between backbone
charges.1 Indeed, electrostatic interactions
make significant contributions to nucleic acid folding stability2−6 and conformational equilibrium and transitions.7 Moreover, metal ions are essential for many biochemical
reactions such as catalytic reactions of ribozymes.8−13 To understand the nucleic acid structure and function, a computational
model for metal ion effects is highly needed.

In general, metal
ions around the nucleic acids can be classified
into site-specific bound (SSB) ions14 and
nonspecific bound (NSB) ions.15 SSB ions
are partially or fully dehydrated and trapped (chelated) at specific
sites or regions such as pockets in three-dimensional (3D) structures,16 whereas NSB ions are often hydrated and form
an “ion cloud” (or “ion atmosphere”)17−19 around the nucleic acid. SSB ions can interact directly with the
nucleic acid20 and participate in nucleic
acid biochemical reactions.8−12 Physical properties of SSB ions, including ion–nucleic acid21 and ion–ion interactions,22,23 can be probed by X-ray and NMR measurements. Theoretically, the
binding sites of SSB ions can be predicted by a variety of methods
such as the knowledge-based MetalionRNA model.24

The interactions between (the large number of) NSB
ions and the
nucleic acid provide a significant stabilizing force for nucleic acid
folding. To understand the ion effects on nucleic acid stability,
it is highly desirable to understand the number and the distribution
of NSB ions. A particularly important property of NSB ions is the
number of excess NSB ions (Γ) in the ion atmosphere. The number
of excess NSB ions Γ is the number of excess ions above the
number expected based on the bulk concentration. In experiments, Γ
can be determined using various “ion count” methods,
such as buffer equilibration and atomic emission spectroscopy,17,19 anomalous small-angle X-ray scattering,25 and dye indicator.26−29 However, experimental determination of further details about the
NSB ion atmosphere such as the ion distribution and ion-induced electrostatic
free energy changes remains a challenge.30 We need theoretical models to predict ion–nucleic acid interactions
and ion binding properties.

Many theories and computational
models such as counterion condensation
(CC) theory31−33 and nonlinear Poisson–Boltzmann (NLPB) theory34−40 have been developed for ion–nucleic acid interactions. These
theories and models have led to important insights into ion effects
on nucleic acid structures and stabilities. However, most of these
theories rely on the mean-field approximation by neglecting the ion
coupling (correlation) effect. In an ionic solution, ions can be correlated
due to volume exclusion and Coulombic interactions.30 Such a correlation can be particularly strong for ions
distributed in the close vicinity of the nucleic acid surface, where
ion concentrations can be high. Previous experimental and theoretical
results have suggested that the correlation effect could be important
for multivalent ions.17,30,41,42

According to the ion correlation strength,
the NSB ions can be
further classified into two types: the diffusely bound (DB) ions for
the weakly correlated ions15 and the tightly
bound (TB) ions for the strongly correlated ions.42 Although both the DB and the TB ions belong to the NSB
ions, they have different binding properties. The DB ions move around
the nucleic acid diffusely in the region separated from the nucleic
acid surface by a distance,43 whereas the
TB ions are clustered around the nucleic acid surface to form a thin
layer of high local concentration.42 The
strong ion correlation lowers the mobility of the TB ions.30 It is important to note that unlike SSB ions,
TB ions are assumed to be fully hydrated and do not form direct chelation
with the nucleic acid. Experiment–NLPB comparisons17,19 showed that the NLPB model may provide reliable predictions for
the weakly correlated ions (DB ions) but could also underestimate
the ion binding effects for the strongly correlated ions (TB ions).

DB ions can be treated as a continuous fluid with the mean-field
theory. However, TB ions, which are strongly correlated, need to be
treated at the level of discrete many-particle distributions to account
for the coupling between the different ions. Molecular dynamics (MD)
simulations are able to fully account for the correlation effect in
ion–nucleic acid interactions,44 such as Mg2+ binding to the SAM-I riboswitch,45 5S rRNA Loop E Motif,46 and ribozyme.47 Monte Carlo (MC) simulations
can also sample the correlated Mg2+ distributions around
the nucleic acids.48−50 The sampling of the discrete ion distributions intrinsically
reveals the ion fluctuation effect, which can be important for RNA
folding.30,42

The previous emphasis on the ion correlation
effect has been nearly
exclusively focused on the multivalent ions such as Mg2+ ions. Successful attempts have been made to address the correlation
for multivalent ions by modifying the NLPB51−53 or the CC models.54 However, recent experimental evidence indicated
that monovalent ions may also cause ion correlation effects in ion–nucleic
acid interactions.19,55,56 MD simulations can treat correlation effects with discrete monovalent
ions;57−59 however, the applications (for monovalent ions or
divalent ions) are limited by the long computational time with the
explicit treatment for salt, solvent, and atoms in nucleic acids.60 To enhance the computational efficiency, the
three-dimensional reference interaction site model (3D-RISM) was developed
to implicitly treat the solvent in simulations by solving the Ornstein
and Zernike integral equation.61,62 Ions are treated as
discrete particles in 3D-RISM. Compared to the NLPB model, the monovalent
ion distribution predicted by 3D-RISM is in good agreement with the
MD simulation results.61 The 3D-RISM model
partly relies on MD simulations, so the prediction results can depend
on the selected force fields.61

The
tightly bound ion (TBI) model is a hybrid statistical mechanical
model for ion–nucleic acid interactions, which combines the
explicit enumeration/sampling of the discrete ion distributions for
strongly correlated ions and a mean-field approach for the continuous
distributions of weakly correlated ions. The model was originally
developed to predict the effect of multivalent ions, particularly,
divalent ions, by considering explicitly the ion correlation and fluctuation
effects.42 In this model, the discrete
many-body distributions for the TB (strongly correlated) ions are
enumerated and the (correlated) ion–nucleic acid interactions
are calculated for each discrete ion distribution. For the DB (weakly
correlated) ions, the mean-field NLPB is applied to compute the electrostatic
free energy. Extensive comparisons with experimental data have suggested
that the TBI model provides improved predictions for the ion effects
in nucleic acid folding stabilities.63−71 The original TBI model is severely limited by the low computational
efficiency due to the time-consuming enumeration method, even for
coarse-grained (CG) ion distributions. Recently, to enhance the computation
efficiency, MCTBI,72,73 a new TBI model, was developed
using the Monte Carlo method to sample the TB ion distribution. Compared
to the original TBI model, the MCTBI model has two notable advantages:
a significant (1000-fold) increase in the computational efficiency
and the use of full three-dimensional coordinate-based ion distributions.

To account for the correlation and fluctuation effects for the
monovalent ions, on the basis of the original MCTBI model,72 we here develop a generalized MCTBI-like (gMCTBI)
model in this paper. In the original MCTBI model, only multivalent
cations such as Mg2+ are classified into the TB and DB
ions, whereas all of the monovalent cations such as Na+ are regarded as DB ions.72,73 Therefore, TB ions
in the original model include only multivalent cations. In the current
gMCTBI model, however, TB ions include not only the (strongly correlated)
multivalent ions but also the (strongly correlated) monovalent ions.
As a result, the gMCTBI model accounts for three types of ion–ion
correlations: monovalent–monovalent, monovalent–multivalent,
and multivalent–multivalent. The model has the potential to
provide not only improved predictions for the number of bound ions
but also more complete and detailed insights into ion binding properties
such as the most probable ion distributions. Using gMCTBI, we investigate
the ion binding properties around the nucleic acids for Na+ and Na+ mixed with other monovalent cations (such as
Li+ and Cs+) or divalent cations (Mg2+) and validate the theoretical predictions with available experimental
data. The model predictions for various systems also reveal new features
of ion distributions and ion–nucleic acid interactions.

2 Results and Discussion
To compare our theoretical predictions
with the experimental results,
we compute the excess number of bound ions Γα for type-α ions; see eqs S4 and S5 in the Supporting Information (SI).74 To show the results for the detailed distribution of the bound ions,
we also compute the linear density ρΓ(x)45 as the spatial distribution
function61,62 for the excess ions (see eq S6). The physical meaning of the linear density is that
ρΓ(x)dx equals
the excess number Γ of ions in the region between distances x and x + dx. Here, for
DNA helix, x denotes the distance measured from the
helix axis. For tRNAPhe, which has a more complicated structure,
we define x as the distance to the RNA surface.45 The explicit treatment for discrete ion distributions
enables us to predict the average and the most probable distributions
for TB ions (see eq S7). Furthermore, we
compare the results with and without the monovalent ion correlation
to assess its effect in ion binding. In this section, we mainly study
the ion binding properties around the nucleic acids in various salt
solutions: NaBr (Section 2.1), mixed monovalent salt solution (Section 2.2), and monovalent–divalent mixed
salt solution (Section 2.3). In Section 2.4, we will predict the detailed ion binding properties to show
the importance of the monovalent ion correlation effects.

2.1 Binding Properties of Na+ around
B-DNA
We first investigate the ion binding properties for
a 24-bp B-DNA helix in a NaBr solution. Figure 1A shows the results for the excess (depletion)
number of Na+ (Br–) ions predicted from
the original MCTBI and the current gMCTBI models. Both results agree
with the experimental data.19 The negative
charges on the DNA attract the cation Na+ and exclude the
anion Br–. According to the linear density profile
predicted by the gMCTBI model (Figure 1B), the cation (Na+) accumulation can be
classified into the strong accumulation region (several high peaks
in the region x < 20 Å) and the weak accumulation
region (a long tail at x > 20 Å). The DNA
helix
in a high-[Na+] solution can attract more excess Na+ ions (higher peaks) in the strong accumulation region, resulting
in a stronger charge neutralization and consequently less excess Na+ ions (a lower long tail) in the weak accumulation region.
The decay of the linear density of the excess cations in the weak
accumulation region can cause a lower total number ΓNa+ of the excess Na+ ions. In fact, the long
tail of the excess Na+ in the dilute [Na+] can
extend to more than 100 Å into solution. As a result, ΓNa+ decreases with the increase in [Na+] (see Figure 1A).

Figure 1 Predictions
for ion binding for a 24-bp DNA helix in a NaBr solution.
(A) Excess number of Na+ and Br– in various
bulk [Na+]. Here, the experimental data (blue circles)
is extracted from ref (19). (B) Linear density of the bound Na+ and Br– ions predicted by the gMCTBI model for the different [Na+]. (C) Predicted TB Na+-ion average distributions corresponding
to the three peaks in (B). (D) Most probable distributions of the
TB Na+ ions (purple balls) at [Na+] = 10, 100,
and 200 mM. To show the ion distributions, we use VMD and Chimera
to show the (C) average and the (D) most probable distributions, respectively.

Similar to the cations, the depletion of Br– ions
around the DNA can also be classified into the strong depletion (a
deep valley) and weak depletion (a long tail) regions (Figure 1B). For a higher salt bulk
concentration [NaBr], more anions Br– would be excluded
from the DNA helix due to the repulsion from the negatively charged
backbone, leading to a valley in the linear density profile in the
strong depletion region. In the meantime, the stronger charge neutralization
(due to more excess Na+ and depleted Br– in the strong accumulation/depletion regions) results in weaker
depletion effect for Br– in the weak depletion region
(i.e., a higher long tail in the weak depletion region). In Figure 1B, we find that the
difference in the long tails for Br– between high
and low salt concentrations (e.g., between [Na+] = 200
and 10 mM) is smaller than that for Na+. Therefore, different
from ΓNa+, whose trend with [Na+] is mainly governed by the long tail in the linear density profile,
the overall depletion (ΓBr–) of
Br– is dominated by the number of the depleted Br– in the strong depletion region (deep valley), giving
rise to the decrease of ΓBr– with
an increasing [Na+].

As [Na+] changes,
the net excess charge Γtot = ∑αZαΓα = ΓNa+ + |ΓBr–|
(α = ion species) remains near
+46e. Considering that the DNA backbone charge is
equal to −46e, the result here suggests that
the DNA with the bound ions remains neutral. The MCTBI and the gMCTBI
(with and without monovalent ion correlation, respectively) provide
similar predictions for the excess and depletion number of ions. The
result seems to suggest that the monovalent ion correlation effect
might not be strong enough to cause significant differences in the
total number of bound/repelled ions. However, previous studies based
on the comparisons between MD simulation and NLPB model predictions
indicated that the monovalent ion correlation effect could lead to
different ion distributions near the surface of the nucleic acids61 (Section 2.4).

Because the gMCTBI model samples the discrete
positions for each
TB ion, particularly, the monovalent ion, which is treated with a
continuum model in the original MCTBI model, gMCTBI can account for
discrete distributions for both the monovalent and multivalent ions.
As a result, one of the major improvements in the gMCTBI model is
its ability to compute the fluctuations and ensemble (probability)
distribution of the monovalent (as well the multivalent) ions [probability p(k) of finding a TB Na+ ion
at site k]. Describing ion binding at the level of
discrete ion positions for monovalent ions can uncover many ion binding
properties unattainable through the original MCTBI model.

The
Na+ ions in the strong accumulation region may dominate
the nucleic acid–ion interactions because these ions show lower
diffusion and closer interaction with the DNA.43 As shown in Figure 1B, there are three density peaks in the strong accumulation
region. In fact, the three peaks in the linear density profile are
mainly from the TB Na+ ions (see Figure S1 in SI). For peak 1 (Figure 1C), the closest peak to the DNA helix, the (fully hydrated)
Na+ ions are mainly distributed inside (and along) the
deep, wide major groove of the DNA (see Figure 1C). For peak 2, in contrast, ions are mainly
distributed around the minor groove. These hydrated ions are too bulky
to enter the (narrow) minor groove. Physically, ions at peaks 1 and
2 are attracted to the major and minor groove regions due to the high
DNA backbone charge densities in these regions. We note that the predicted
ion probability distribution also shows scattered high-probability
ion binding sites near the major groove. For regions (such as peak
3) further away from the DNA, the distinction between the groove and
nongroove regions disappears and TB Na+ ions are more uniformly
distributed around the DNA. Here, we should note that since the gMCTBI
model does not account for the desolvation effect of the ions, the
binding sites of dehydrated Na+ ions and the corresponding
density peak are not predicted.

Another important advantage
of the gMCTBI model (vs the original
MCTBI) is that it can give the most probable (discrete) distribution
of the TB monovalent ions (see Figure 1D). At a low [Na+] (e.g., 10 mM in Figure 1D), the most probable
distribution corresponds to TB Na+ ions distributed along
the minor groove, presumably due to the high charge density in the
(narrow) minor groove region. At a higher [Na+], such as
100 mM, more Na+ ions are populated and interact with the
minor groove. Additionally, at high [Na+] (200 mM in Figure 1D), in addition to
the majority of ions, which are distributed in the minor groove region,
there are Na+ ions (circles in the figure) distributed
in the major groove region in the most probable distribution. Here,
the most probable distribution of TB ions is determined by the many-ion
interaction energy of all of the bound ions (including TB and DB ions;
see Section 4 in SI). Hence, a minor movement
of the TB ions from the sites in the most probable distribution may
not cause a dramatic increase in the interaction energy, suggesting
that the TB ions may fluctuate around the bound sites of the most
probable distribution.

2.2 Interplay between Different
Monovalent Cations
The gMCTBI model allows us to further
investigate the ion binding
properties for a nucleic acid in a mixed salt solution, which contains
background cations (bc) Na+ and competing cations (cc)
such as Li+, Cs+, or TMA+. Figure 2A–C shows
the excess bound ion number around a 24-bp DNA helix in various salt
conditions. Experiment55–theory
comparisons indicate that both the current gMCTBI model and the original
MCTBI model can accurately predict the number of excess ions. The
model predicts that as the bulk concentration of the competing cations
[cc] is increased, more competing cations would bind to the DNA due
to the lower entropic cost for ion binding. In the meantime, less
background cations (Na+) are bound to the DNA. The slightly
reduced depletion of Br– (ΓBr–) is accompanied by a slight increase in the total number of
excess cations (Γcc + Γbc). The
predicted results are similar to those for a single salt solution
(see Figure 1A).

Figure 2 (A–C)
Excess number of ions predicted by the gMCTBI (red
lines with squares) and the original MCTBI (black lines with triangles)
model for a mixed solution with (A) Na+ and Li+, (B) Na+ and Cs+, and (C) Na+ and
TMA+. The experiment data come from ref (55). (D–F) Linear density
of the ions solved by the gMCTBI model corresponding to the cases
in (A)–(C), respectively.

As shown in Figure 2A–C, for the different salt solutions [Li+]eq ≈ 35 mM (versus 40 mM Na+), [Cs+]eq ≈ 59 mM (versus 50 mM Na+), and
[TMA+]eq ≈ 67 mM (versus 50 mM Na+), respectively, the competing and the background cations
show a similar number of excess ions for the three solutions. Here,
[cc]eq denotes the competing cation concentration under
which the competing cation and background cation reach an equal number
of excess ions: Γcc = Γbc. Although
the different solutions show a similar number of excess ions, smaller
cations are more competitive and show higher peaks in the close vicinity
of the DNA (and lower peaks and tails in regions away from the DNA;
see Figure 2D–F).
The result indicates that the smaller cations are bound to the DNA
more tightly. The predictions agree with previous results based on
3D-RISM62 and MD simulations.58

2.3 Interplay between Monovalent
and Divalent
Ions
As shown in Figure 3A–C for the 24-bp DNA duplex and Figure 3D for a tRNA in various salt
conditions, gMCTBI gives overall improved predictions than the original
MCTBI. Furthermore, the results reveal an intriguing interplay between
the monovalent cation, the divalent cation, and the anion. For a solution
containing background cations and competing cations, an increase in
the competing cation concentration would lead to more competing cations
and less background cations bound to the nucleic acid.

Figure 3 Ion excess number predicted
by the gMCTBI (red lines with squares)
and the original (black lines with triangles) MCTBI models for (A)
6 mM background Mg2+ ion mixed with Na+, (B)
5 mM background Mg2+ mixed with Na+, (C) 20
mM background Na+ mixed with Mg2+ for a 24-bp
DNA, and (D) 10 mM background Na+ mixed with Mg2+ for a 76-nt tRNA (PDB id: 1TRA(81)). Here, the experimental
data are adopted from ref (55) for (A), ref (17) for (B) and (C), and ref (78) for (D).

For a mixed monovalent–divalent salt solution, as shown
in Figure 3A,B (with
Mg2+ as the background cation), for a 24-bp DNA helix,
the number of excess background cation Mg2+ and competing
cation Na+ reaches equilibrium at 54 and 49 mM Na+ in the background of 6 and 5 mM Mg2+, respectively. The
total excess charge Γtot keeps the nucleic acid neutralized.
For solutions with Na+ as the background cation, as shown
in Figure 3C (for the
24-bp DNA) and Figure 3D (for a tRNA), the equilibrium occurs at 1.5 and 0.39 mM Mg+ (competing cation) with background cation concentrations
of 20 and 10 mM Na+, respectively. The results show quantitatively
the monovalent–divalent ion competition.

For a solution
with Mg2+ as the background cation (Figure 3A,B), the depletion
number of the anions decreases with the increase in [Na+] of the competing cation, whereas in the cases with Na+ as the background (Figure 3C,D), the depletion number of the anions increases with [Mg2+]. The above trend of ΓCl–(or
Br–) is a result of the decrease/increase
in the number of bound Mg2+ ions, which dominate over Na+ ions in RNA binding. As more Mg2+ ions are bound
to the nucleic acid, less anions will be excluded in the region far
away from the nucleic acid, resulting in an increase in ΓCl–(or Br–).

Moreover,
even in the solution mixed with Mg2+ ions,
the entire nucleic acid-solution system still keeps charge neutrality
(see Figure 3). In
fact, in a small space around a phosphate, we might observe the charge
inversion (the change of net charge sign) or even a giant charge inversion75 (net charge large than +e)
if one or two TB Mg2+ ions are bound to a phosphate. However,
in other regions beyond the small space above, phosphates in the nucleic
acid and the TB cation-attracted anions can neutralize the inverse
net charge in the local space around a phosphate. We also note that
the charge inversion phenomenon of the entire nucleic acid-solution
system can indeed be observed for trivalent or higher-valency cations.74,76

2.4 Effect of the Monovalent Ion Correlation
For a solution of (single or mixed) monovalent cations, neglecting
the monovalent ion correlation effect may still provide good estimations
for the ion excess number (see Figures 1A and 2A–C). However,
the explicit sampling of discrete monovalent ion distributions in
the gMCTBI model, which accounts for ion correlation effects, can
provide more detailed information such as ion spatial distributions
(see Figure 1C,D).
In fact, other ion binding properties beyond the excess number of
ions suggest that the ion correlation effect is indeed important for
the monovalent ions around the nucleic acid even if the solution contains
only monovalent ions. For example, the linear density profiles in Figure 4A shows that monovalent
ion–monovalent ion correlation can promote Na+ accumulation
near the DNA surface. This is because ion correlation lowers the Coulomb
energy through the cooperative organization of the ions and thus induces
more ions to bind to the nucleic acid. The finding agrees with the
predictions from 3D-RISM and MD simulations,61 which also suggested that there are more cations near the DNA surface
than that predicted by mean-field theory.

Figure 4 (A) Comparison of linear
density for Na+ around the
24-bp DNA helix between the predictions from the original MCTBI (black)
and the gMCTBI model. (B) Most probable distributions of the background
ions and the competing ions: 40 mM Na+ versus 35 mM Li+, 50 mM Na+ versus 59 mM Cs+, and 50
mM Na+ versus 67 mM TMA+. Red, yellow, purple,
and green balls represent the Li+, Cs+, Na+, and TMA+ ions, respectively.

The correlation effect for monovalent ions can enhance the ion–ion
competition near the DNA surface. Figure 4B shows the most probable distributions of
the TB ions in the presence of competing cations at concentration
[cc]eq. In the case of Li+–Na+ competition, Li+ ions are found to be distributed only
along the minor groove of the DNA helix. However, for the bulkier
competing cations (Cs+ and TMA+), more Na+ ions are found to bind to the DNA (six Na+ ions
versus three Cs+ ions and seven Na+ ions versus
three TMA+ ions, respectively). Therefore, even though
the DNA attracts the same total (excess) number of cations, the smaller
cations win the competition (against the larger cation) and are more
likely to be found in the close vicinity of the DNA surface. However,
as a caveat, we note that ion dehydration is not considered here.
A smaller ion may bind more tightly with the DNA, but, on the other
hand, it is less likely to dehydrate as water molecules wrap around
smaller ions more tightly.58 In the future,
we need to develop a model that can integrate hydration with the correlation
effect for bound monovalent cations.

For a Na+–Mg2+ mixed solution, compared
with the original MCTBI model, as shown in Figure 3, the gMCTBI model can give overall improved
predictions for the ion excess number in the ion atmosphere. The result
suggests the importance to consider the Na+–Mg2+ ion correlation. In fact, previous studies have suggested
the importance of such a correlation effect in other macromolecular
systems such as protein solutions.77 For
the 24-bp DNA helix system, the original MCTBI model, which ignores
the Na+–Mg2+ ion correlation, overestimates
the excess bound Na+ ions. The correlation effect is more
pronounced for systems involving a larger number of monovalent bound
cations, such as solutions with high [Na+] in a fixed Mg2+ background (Figure 3A,B) or with low [Mg2+] in a fixed Na+ background (Figure 3C). For the tRNA, Figure 3D shows that the original MCTBI model underestimates the excess
number of Na+ ions due to neglecting the Na+–Na+ correlation effect.

As shown by the
linear density in Figure 5 for the 24-bp DNA helix at high (200 mM)
Na+ with 5 mM background Mg2+, the original
MCTBI overestimates Na+ binding and underestimates Mg+ binding near x = 10 and 15 Å. The result
is due to the missing correlation effect for Na+ ions in
the original MCTBI model. For Na+ ion binding, although
as shown in Figure 4A, the Na+–Na+ correlation can enhance
Na+ binding (through multi-ion cooperative organization),
the Na+–Mg2+ correlation (mainly repulsive
through discrete charge–charge volume exclusion and Coulombic
repulsion) causes a reduction in Na+ binding (see Figure 5A). Therefore, the
original MCTBI model, which ignores the effect of discrete Na+ ions and the Na+–Mg2+ correlation
in the TB region, overestimates Na+ ion binding. Furthermore,
as shown in Figure 5B, the reduced Na+ ion binding results in an increased
Mg2+ binding. However, in a solution of high [Mg2+] with background Na+ or a dilute [Na+] solution
with background Mg2+, ion binding is dominated by Mg2+ and the Na+-involved correlation effect is weaker
than the Mg2+–Mg2+ correlation. Therefore,
the gMCTBI model and the original MCTBI model, which differ only in
the treatment of the monovalent ion-induced correlation effect, give
similar predictions for the excess number of bound ions.

density of the bound (A) Na+ and (B) Mg2+ ions
around a 24-bp DNA helix in the solution with 200 mM
Na+ and 5 mM Mg2+. The inset in (B) shows the
accumulated Mg2+ ions around the DNA helix corresponding
to the two peaks. (C) Most probable distributions of the TB ions in
the solution containing 5 mM background Mg2+ ions mixed
with [Na+] = 30, 100, and 200 mM Na+. The red
and green balls denote the Mg2+ and Na+ ions,
respectively

The density plot for Mg2+ (Figure 5B) shows
two peaks. Our predictions for the
most probable ion distributions (Figure 5C) indicate that the two peaks correspond
to bound cations in the major and minor grooves, respectively. For
low [Na+] (30 mM), the gMCTBI model predicts that only
Mg2+ ions are closely distributed around the DNA. As [Na+] increases, less Mg2+ ions are found near the
DNA surface. Only at high [Na+], such as 200 mM (>[Na+]eq), Na+ ions are found in the close
vicinity of the DNA surface in the most probable ion distribution.

For the tRNA case, as shown in Figure 3D, for a limited range in [Mg2+] < 1 mM, the gMCTBI model predicts a higher ΓNa+ and a lower ΓMg2+ than
that predicted by the original MCTBI model. The predictions by the
gMCTBI model are in better agreement with the experimental data.78 Unlike the DNA helix, the tRNA has a more complicated
compact structure, so we use the distance x to the
RNA surface as the x-axis to draw the linear density. According to
the linear density for Na+ shown in Figure 6A, at [Mg2+] = 0.6 mM, the gMCTBI-predicted
Na+ linear density is higher than the original MCTBI-predicted
result. The reason is that the gMCTBI model can treat the discrete
Na+ ions, whereas the previous MCTBI model cannot. For
the complicated 3D structure of the tRNA, Na+ ions (green
balls in Figure 6B)
can be trapped in the pockets that cannot be occupied by the bulkier
Mg2+. The trapped Na+ ions would cause an effective
(excluded volume and electrostatic) repulsive force on the TB Mg2+ ions near the pockets. Such scenarios, which can be well
predicted by the current gMCTBI model, cannot be treated by the original
MCTBI model. In a solution with higher [Mg2+], more TB
Mg2+ ions would be found in the TB region. The stronger
Mg2+–Na+ (repulsive) correlation effect
tends to exclude/displace the trapped Na+ ions (see the
case of [Mg2+] = 6 mM in Figure 6B). As a result, the difference between the
gMCTBI and MCTBI predictions becomes smaller.

3 Conclusions
To summarize, we have developed
a new model, the gMCTBI model,
to predict the ion binding properties for nucleic acids. The model
can treat discrete ion positions and correlations and ion fluctuations
for both multivalent and monovalent ions. Theory–experiment
tests for ion binding properties in monovalent and monovalent–divalent
solutions support the validity of the gMCTBI predictions. In a solution
with (single or mixed) monovalent ions, although the gMCTBI and the
mean-field methods predict similar global binding properties (such
as the excess number of monovalent ions), the gMCTBI model, which
can treat discrete, correlated monovalent ion distributions, may provide
more reliable predictions for the linear density for the bound ions
and the most probable ion distributions. Furthermore, the gMCTBI model
distinguishes from the original MCTBI model in the treatment of monovalent
ions. Therefore, the differences between the predictions from the
two models reveal significant effects of the monovalent ion-involved
correlations.

For a mixed solution of different species of monovalent
ions, the
gMCTBI model, which accounts for discrete monovalent ions, can account
for the ion size effect in ion binding accessibility. Smaller ions
can enter narrow grooves that are not accessible to bulkier ions and
hence are more competitive in ion binding. For a mixed monovalent–divalent
ion solution, the gMCTBI model shows that divalent ions can be more
than 9-fold more competitive than monovalent ions. For example, for
a 24-bp DNA helix, the model predicts the ion concentrations for reaching
equal number of the excess ions: 54 mM Na+ versus 6 mM
Mg2+, 49 mM Na+ versus 5 mM Mg2+,
and 20 mM Na+ versus 1.5 mM Mg2+.

The
interplay between the different species of ions depends on
the 3D structure of the nucleic acid. For example, a less bulky (hydrated)
monovalent ion can more likely bind to RNA narrow pockets, which may
be inaccessible to bulkier divalent ions. Such phenomena become more
significant for more complicated nucleic acid structures such as tRNA,
which can contain various narrow pocket sites for ion binding. Only
at high divalent ion concentrations can the monovalent ions be displaced
from the binding pockets (due to the repulsion from the divalent ions).

The framework of the gMCTBI model may be applicable to other systems
such as highly charged surfaces and charged proteins. However, as
a caveat, we note that the current form of the model ignores anion-involved
correlations. Recent experiments19,55 reported that
a monovalent cation and a monovalent anion could form an ionic cluster
near the DNA surface, indicating that the ion-involved correlation
may be important in ion–nucleic acid interactions. Therefore,
future development of the model would include anion correlation effects
by explicitly sampling the distribution of discrete anions.

4 Materials and Methods
4.1 Preparations for the Theoretical
Predictions
We use the modeling of ion effects for two nucleic
acid structures
to illustrate the gMCTBI: a 24-base pair (24-bp) B-form DNA and a
76-nt yeast tRNAPhe. The 3D structure of the 24-bp DNA
is generated from the latest version (version 2.1) of the program
X3DNA,79 whereas the structure of tRNAPhe is downloaded from the protein data bank (PDB)80 and its PDB ID is 1TRA.81 In this
study, we use the same sequences as the ones used in the experimental
study for the B-DNA helix:55 S1 = 5′-GGT GAC GAG TGA GCT ACT GGG CGG-3′ and S2 = 5′-CCG CCC AGT AGC TCA CTC GTC ACC-3′. A coarse-grained (CG) charge model is used72,73 where each phosphorus atom carries an electronic charge (−e) and other atoms are treated as neutral. The CG charge
model, however, cannot account for the sequence-dependence of the
charge distribution on the nucleic acids. Therefore, the predictions
from the gMCTBI model are dependent on the nucleic acid structure
but not the sequence. Here, we should note that because the 24-bp
DNA carries −46e net charges,17,19,55 we manually deleted the 5′
terminal phosphates in both chains of the 24-bp DNA helix.

To
reduce the boundary effect, the nucleic acid is placed in a large
solution box, whose size is larger than 6 times Debye length. To test
the model, various salt conditions are used, including single salt
and mixed salt (with two cation species) conditions. All solutions
contain Na+ either as the single species cation or as the
background in a mixed salt solution. For the mixed salt, the other
cation species may be monovalent ions, Li+, Cs+, and tetramethylammonium ion (TMA+), or divalent ions
Mg2+. The bulk concentrations in the solution satisfy the
charge neutrality condition: ∑(Zici)+ = c–, where Zi and ci denote the charge and the bulk concentration of the cation species i, respectively, and c– is the bulk concentration of an anion (Br– or
Cl–). Ions are considered to be fully hydrated in
our calculations. For Na+, Mg2+, and Cl–, their (hydrated) ion radii are 3.5, 4.5, and 4.0
Å, respectively. We note that these are the same parameters used
in the previous studies.65,72,73 The Mg2+ and the Na+ ion radii correspond
to two and one hydrated shells, respectively.82,83 Previous experiments19,55 suggested that as the anion Cl– is replaced with Br–, the ion binding
effects remain nearly the same. Thus, we set the effective Br– radius the same (4.0 Å) as that of Cl–. For other alkali cations Li+ (3.1 Å) and Cs+ (4.1 Å), their radii are estimated from the difference
in van der Waals radius84 between the cation
(Li+ or Cs+) and Na+ and the hydrated
Na+ radius.85,86 Additionally, the radius of the
(hydrated) organic cation TMA+ is assumed to be 4.65 Å.87

4.2 Modeling the Monovalent
Ion Correlation Effect
The gMCTBI model is developed based
on the original MCTBI model72 (see SI for a brief
summary of the MCTBI model). The major difference between the gMCTBI
model developed here and the original MCTBI model is the different
treatments of the monovalent cations.

4.2.1 TB
Regions for the Different Types of Cations
The NLPB calculation
is employed to roughly estimate the ion concentration
around a given nucleic acid. Based on the ion concentration, the ion
correlation strength at a given position x can be
calculated as 1  here, superscripts (or subscripts) i and j denote the ion species. In the
above equation, i and j can be the
same or different ion species. z, kB, T (=25 °C in our calculations),
and εw (≈78 at room temperature) are the charge
(valency), Boltzmann constant, temperature, and solvent dielectric
constant, respectively. aws(x) and c(x) denote the Wigner–Seitz
radius88 and the local ion concentration
at position x, respectively. c0 is the bulk concentration in the solution. The region with
ion correlation strength C(x) larger
than 2.6 (the critical value for the gaseous to liquid phase transition
for an ion system42) is defined as the
TB region.

One of the important features that distinguish the
gMCTBI model from the original MCTBI model is the different TB regions.
Here, we use a 24-bp B-DNA in a mixed solution of [Mg2+] = 10 mM and [Na+] = 100 mM as an example. In the original
MCTBI model, monovalent ions are completely excluded from the consideration
of ion correlation, and as shown in Figure 7A, the TB region is defined only for Mg2+ ions. In contrast, in the gMCTBI model, as shown in Figure 7B, we distinguish
three parts of the TB region according to the different ion species
(i.e., different i and j’s
in eq 1). For a mixed
divalent/monovalent (such as Mg2+/Na+) salt
solution, the M22 region is the part for Mg2+ only (i = j = Mg2+ in eq 1), the M12 region is the part for
both Mg2+ and Na+ simultaneously (i = Mg2+ and j = Na+ in eq 1), and the M11 region is
the part for Na+ only (i = j = Na+ in eq 1).

Figure 7 TB regions in the (A) original MCTBI model and (B) gMCTBI model.
The 24-bp DNA structure is labeled by blue color. The black, cyan,
and pink regions correspond to the TB regions for Na+–Na+, Na+–Mg2+, and Mg2+–Mg2+ correlations, respectively.

The three parts of the TB region are determined separately
by eq 1. Basically, the
M22 region
is usually the largest because the Mg2+–Mg2+ correlation is the strongest. The M12 region is accessible to both
TB Na+ and Mg2+ ions. Because of the weaker
Na+–Mg2+ (than Mg2+–Mg2+) correlation, the M12 region is thinner than the M22 region.
The M11 region, which may be accessible to Na+ but not
to Mg2+ due to the bulky size of a fully hydrated Mg2+, is the closest to the surface of the nucleic acid and the
thinnest (<0.5 Å in thickness42). In fact, in a dilute monovalent cation solution, the M11 and M12
regions could disappear. To make sure that there is enough space for
explicit sampling of the discrete distributions of monovalent cations,
we set layers with 0.5 Å minimum thickness for the M11 and M12
regions, respectively. In addition to the radii of atoms and the hydrated
ions, the TB Na+ can be found at a distance ∼15
Å from the helix axis. In particular, for the M11 region, if
only based on the ion correlation strength calculated from eq 1, the thickness of the
region is much less than 0.5 Å even at high [Na+].
Therefore, in the solution with pure monovalent ions, almost all of
the TB ions are located in the M11 region. However, for these TB ions,
the correlation exists although it may be weak. The M11 region is
set up such that, compared with the implicit method, the explicit
treatment for ions can provide a higher-resolution description for
the bound ions near the nucleic acid surface.

4.2.2 Partition Function
To take into
account the monovalent ion effects, in the gMCTBI model, we compute
the partition function (PF) of a nucleic acid-solution in a way such
that the different species of ions (monovalent and multivalent ions)
are treated equally. Specifically, for a given nucleic acid with Np nucleotides, the PF is calculated from 2  here, superscripts (or subscripts) i and j represent the ion species. Nb and Nmax denote
the number and the maximum saturated number of TB ions in the TB region,
respectively. Similar to the original MCTBI model,72 we assume that the maximum allowed TB ion numbers correspond
to the reversal of the net nucleic acid charge 3  Here, we note that Nmaxi and Nmaxj are determined by the MCID
process described in the following text.

Z(Nbi, Nbj) in eq 2 is the partition function over all of the
ion distributions with Nbi TB ion i and Nbj TB ion j in the TB region. Z(Nbi, Nbj) is computed as 4  here, Zid is the
PF for the (ideal) solution without the nucleic acid and c0 denotes the bulk concentration of the ion. The product
“∏” corresponds to the insertion process of the
TB ions. w(n) is the statistical
weight arising from the nth step of the insertion
and is dependent on the pre-existing ion distribution in the TB region
(see eq S1 in SI). ΔGd is the electrostatic free energy for the DB ions (see eq S3 in SI). One of the key ingredients in the
model is the sampling of the TB ion distributions using the MCID algorithm,
in particular, for the monovalent ions; see below.

4.2.3 Monte Carlo Insertion Deletion (MCID) Algorithm
We
consider a divalent/monovalent ion mixed solution. To sample
the TB ions, we first insert the ions one by one into the TB region.
For each insertion step, we run two-step Monte Carlo sampling: we
first randomly select the ion type and then randomly choose a position
to insert the selected ion. According to eq 4, for the nth inserted cation,
the free energy change of the whole nucleic acid-solution system can
be calculated as 5  here, n could be ni for the species i or nj for the species j. The first and
second terms describe the interaction energy
changes for the TB ions (in the TB region) and for the DB ions (in
the DB region), respectively. Here, ΔΔGd(n – 1 → n) = ΔGd(n) –
ΔGd(n –
1), where ΔGd(n) and ΔGd(n –
1) are the electrostatic free energies of the DB ions with n and n – 1 TB ions in the TB region,
respectively (see eq S3 in SI). To enhance
the computational efficiency, for the calculation of ΔΔGd, we assume that a newly inserted TB ion is
nonspecifically condensed to the nucleic acid; thus, ΔΔGd is a function of the number of TB ions. This
approximation allows us to precalculate ΔΔGd to save the computational time.

We randomly select
the species i (or j) for the inserted
TB ions according to the following probability 6  After
determining the species of the inserted
ion, we randomly place the ion in the TB region according to the following
probability (for ion n placed at site k) 7  here, Un(k) represents the interaction energy change
upon the insertion of an ion n at site k (see eq S2 in SI). mk is the number of available (vacant)
sites in the M11 and M12 TB regions for monovalent cations and in
the M12 and M22 regions for divalent cations. Based on eqs 5–7, we insert the TB ions one by one until the TB region is saturated.
In fact, the maximum number of the TB ions Nmaxi for species i and Nmaxj for species j is determined by the total charge
limitation (eq 3) and
the insertion process (eqs 5–7). Here, eqs 5 and 6 determine the
type of the inserted ion (species i or j) and eq 7 gives the
site (location) of the inserted ion. Equation 3 determines whether the insertion process
should be terminated. If the total charge of the TB ions reaches the
maximum saturated value (2Np with Np as the number of nucleotides), the insertion
process is terminated and the subsequent deletion process is started.

In the above insertion process, as a new TB ion is inserted, the
pre-existing TB ions cannot adjust their distribution. To allow the
ions to redistribute, we re-sample the ion distribution by randomly
removing ions one by one such that higher-energy ions have a higher
probability to be removed. Specifically, the probability for removing
ion n′ (at site k) from an n-TB ion system is determined by the energy change ΔUn′(k) for the process 8  From the (n – 1)-TB
ion distributions generated in the above deletion procedure, we compute
the statistical weight w(n) using eq S1 in SI. We note that unlike the original
MCTBI model, the current gMCTBI model considers the sampling of both
monovalent and multivalent TB ions through an extra sampling process,
namely, the random sampling of the ion species for the ions to be
inserted (or deleted) based on eqs 5 and 6.
