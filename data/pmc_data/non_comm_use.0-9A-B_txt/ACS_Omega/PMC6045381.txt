A new
S-alkylated cysteine-derivatized tumor targeting agent, 2,2′-(12-(2-((2-acetamido-2-carboxyethyl)thio)acetamido)-11,13-dioxo-1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclotridecane-4,7-diyl)diacetic
acid was developed for positron emission tomography (PET) imaging. N-Acetyl cysteine (NAC) was conjugated to ATRIDAT as a specific
targeting agent toward L-type and ASC amino acid transporter systems
in the oncogenic cells. NAC was attached via S-alkylation to prevent
its incorporation at undesired recognition sites affecting the signal-to-noise
ratio. NAC-ATRIDAT was subjected to gallium-68 complexation with >75%
radiolabeling yield. The radiocomplex was purified through the tc18
cartridge to obtain 99.89% radiochemical yield. IC-50 of the NAC-ATRIDAT
conjugate was 0.8 mM in A549 cells as evaluated through 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazonium
bromide assay. Binding affinity experiments on A549 cells showed noteworthy
binding with KD in the nanomolar range.
A time course study showed a Km value
of 0.19 μM and Vmax value of
0.49 pmol/μg protein/min showing reasonable tumor kinetics.
Efflux studies showed that the synthesized radioligand is transported
majorly by LAT followed by the ASC system. Clearance was found to
be renal with 7.67 ± 1.48% ID/g uptake at 30 min which substantially
declined to 0.52 ± 0.% ID/g at 4 h. A significant uptake of 10.06
± 1.056% ID/g was observed at the tumor site in mice at 1 h.
μPET images revealed a high contrast with a tumor-to-kidney
ratio of 4.8 and a tumor-to-liver ratio of 35.85 at 1 h after injection.
These preclinical in vitro and in vivo evaluation supports its potential
on the way of becoming a successful 68Ga-radiolabeled amino
acid-based PET imaging agent.

==== Body
Introduction
Amino acids and their
derivatives labeled with radioactive isotopes
are being extensively used in clinics and research labs as positron
emission tomography (PET)/single-photon emission computed tomography
imaging agents. Enhanced accretion of amino acids in tumor cells as
a consequence of increased amino acid transport and protein synthesis
is primarily responsible for their role in cancer imaging.1−5 The increase in the number of amino acid transporters in oncogenic
proliferating cells has been documented by scientists in their reports.
Among the transporters, the L-type transport system is markedly elevated
in the cancer cells and is a key factor for transport of amino acids
in them.6−9 Also, the finding that imaging with amino acids is less influenced
by the inflammatory changes in the body makes it a lucrative system
for diagnostic imaging.2

Many 18F-radiolabeled amino acids have been advanced
for clinical PET applications. 4-[18F]fluoro-l-phenylalanine ([18F]FPhe) and 2-[18F]fluoro-l-tyrosine ([18F]FET) have shown promising results,
yet their complicated radiolabeling procedures and low radiochemical
yields are a limitation.10−13O-(2-[18F]-fluoroethyl)-l-tyrosine ([18F]FET), 2-[18F]fluoro-R-methyl-l-tyrosine ([18F]FMT), and
[18F]FDOPA are other 18F-labeled PET tracers,
but their use focusses on brain-related abnormalities mainly.14−19 Outside the brain, their uptake is moderate in tumor tissues as
compared to the surrounding healthy tissues, giving a poor to average
target-to-nontarget ratio. Some recently synthesized compounds, 3-[18F]fluoro-2-methyl-2-(methylamino)propanoic acid ([18F]NMeFAMP), 2-amino-3-[18F]fluoro-2-methylpropanoic acid
([18F]FAMP),1-amino-3-[18F]fluorocyclobutyl-1-carboxylic
acid ([18F]FACBC), and 1-amino-3-[18F]fluoromethyl-cyclobutane-1-carboxylic
acid ([18F]FMACBC) have shown good localization at the
brain and tumor site.20−23

S-11C-methyl-l-methionine
(11C-MET) is an extensively used PET tumor imaging agent
based on an amino acid. However, owing to its incorporation in the
protein segments via the amino-acyl-transfer RNA pathway along with
its degradation products, 11C-MET produces a significant
amount of radioactive metabolites which leads to a decrease in its
specificity and selectivity in vivo.24 Also,
MET gets assimilated into nonprotein matter like phospholipids and
RNA through the transmethylation process (transfer of its radiolabeled
methyl group) via S-adenosyl-l-methionine.25 Both these side reactions create substantial
nonspecific background signal, making quantitative imaging very difficult
at the tumor target site.

All these amino acid derivatives have
been radiolabeled with 11C or 18F, restricting
their use in PET centers
having an in-house cyclotron facility or nearby cyclotron center.26−28 Bourdier et al. reported that an S-alkylated derivative can remove
the chances of the amino acid analogue to participate in the side
reactions and thus reduce the formation of secondary metabolites,
resulting in the reduction of nonspecific signals/background noise.29 Deng et al. and Huang et al. also reported the
synthesis of S-alkylated cysteine derivatives, with high uptake in
the tumor and nearly no accumulation in the protein components.26,27 Therefore an S-alkylated amino acid derivative PET imaging agent
with a chelator, shown to possess high stability with metal ions in
the M2+ and M3+ form, especially Ga(III), was
proposed. ATRIDAT, already reported by our group to form thermodynamically
stable and strong complexes with Ga(III) was used for conjugating
the cysteine derivative after slight modification in the pendant arm,
keeping the macrocyclic framework intact.30 PET is a highly sensitive technique which provides a method to visualize
and quantify the uptake at the target site. PET aids in early diagnosis,
as it detects the changes in the biochemical pathways, allowing detection
of disease before the appearance of anatomical changes. Being a generator-produced
radioisotope along with an ideal half-life, 68Ga with its
optimum isotope energy makes an attractive radioisotope for PET imaging.
The comparatively shorter half-life of 68Ga and hydrophilic
nature of the complex allows rapid renal clearance which ultimately
reduces the radiation burden to the patient. 68Ga-PET is
extensively used in the diagnosis and management of tumors owing to
defined chemistry of Ga(III) with triaza- and tetraaza macrocyclic
molecules.31,32

Results and Discussion
Synthesis
Synthetic strategy utilizes S-alkylation
of N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) with a chloroacetylated
derivative of a 13-membered protected macrocycle, di-tert-butyl 2,2′-(12-((tert-botoxycarbonyl)amino)-11,13-dioxo-1,4,7,10-tetraazatridecane-4,7-diyl)diacetate
(1)30 (Scheme 1). The Boc group of this macrocycle (1) was selectively cleaved using HCl gas dissolved in ethyl
acetate, exposing the amine group for further reaction to give compound 2. This reaction occurs in 2–3 h, and the product formed
precipitates as a pale yellow solid in the reaction solvent which
can be used as such without further purification. The free amine group
was then chloroacetylated (3) to alkylate NAC (bio vector)
from the thiol side to synthesize compound 4. Conjugation
of the biovector was confirmed by the presence of an additional peak
for 3 protons at 2 ppm (for methyl protons of the acetyl group) in
the 1H NMR spectra and the peak at 23 ppm for the carbon
of this methyl group in the 13C spectra. A peak at 176
ppm appears in the 13C spectra, for the carboxyl group
of the cysteine. In mass spectra, the conjugation is confirmed by
the [M + H]+ peak at 661.5 m/z. This intermediate on trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) treatment gave
the final compound (5) confirmed by the [M – H]− peak at m/z 547.3
in the mass spectra. All synthesized compounds were characterized
through spectroscopic techniques such as NMR and mass spectrometry
(see the Supporting Information). The synthesized
molecule targets the enhanced amino acid uptake and the elevated AA
transporters in the tumor cells and S-alkylated to prevent its incorporation
in the nondesired protein/nonprotein segments for high tumor-to-background
ratio.

Radiolabeling, Serum Stability
and log P
The labeling
of ATRIDAT-NAC was performed with 68Ga using middle fraction
of the 68Ge/68Ga generator elute. 68Ga-radiolabeling of ATRIDAT-NAC was accomplished at the ambient temperature
of 90 °C for 10 min at pH 4.5. Temperature less than 90 °C
or reduced time of heating significantly decreased the radiolabeling
yield. A decent radiochemical yield of 78% with 98.9% radiochemical
purity and 5 MBq/nmol of specific activity was obtained after C-18
cartridge purification. The radiocomplex was confirmed through EZ-thin-layer
chromatography (TLC), with the dominant peak showing the 68Ga-ATRIDAT-NAC moiety. The radiolabeled compound exhibited more than
97% stability in human serum upto 60 min which reduced to 75% after
4 h incubation when traced with instant TLC (ITLC) (see the Supporting Information for the HPLC profile,
EZ-TLC, radiolabeling optimization and serum stability graphs). The
intact percentage of the radiotracer is reasonable to perform the
biological studies with 3–4 h duration. The distribution of
the radiotracer in octanol and phosphate buffered saline (PBS) gave
a log P value of −2.63 ± 0.04 showing its greater affinity
toward the hydrophilic system.

Cell Viability Assay
The in vitro cytotoxicity of the
conjugate was assessed by incubating A549 cells with different concentrations
of ATRIDAT-NAC at 24, 48, and 72 h time intervals. At lower concentrations
of the ligand, no significant toxicity was observed. At 1 mM concentration
of the compound, 70.76 ± 1.64% viability was obtained at 24 h
which decreased to 67.52 ± 0.54% at 48 h and 56.37 ± 1.73%
at 72 h of incubation (Figure 1). IC50 in A549 cells was observed to be 0.8 mM,
indicating its safe and nontoxic behavior. Toxicity of cells was observed
to be dose-dependent at all time points.

for 24, 48, and 72 h duration from 1 pM to 10 mM concentration range.

Time Course and Kinetics
Study
Time progression analysis
showed that the transport of 68Ga-ATRIDAT-NAC into A549
cells was fast and linear upto 30 min, then reaching saturation at
60 min of incubation. Linear correlation was seen as a result of a
saturable system because of L followed by the ASC transporter system
in Eadie–Hofstee transformation (Figure 2). A kinetic study revealed a Michaelis constant
(Km) value of 0.19 μM and Vmax (maximal transport rate) with a value of
0.49 pmol/μg protein/min.

Uptake was seen from
0.5 to 60 min. The inset depicts an Eadie–Hofstee graph of
saturable transport. The experiment was performed in triplicates,
and values are mean SD of 3 measurements.

Cell Binding Studies
Cell binding assay of 68Ga-ATRIDAT-NAC was done on A549 cells to assess the binding of the
radioconjugate to the transporters on the surface of tumor cells.
Nonspecific binding was evaluated by the addition of 100 times excess
of unlabeled cold NAC. The binding curve revealed appreciable binding
of ATRIDAT-NAC on the A549 tumor cell line surface (Figure 3). The Scatchard plot analysis
showed significant affinity of the synthesized compound on the tumor
cells. The dissociation constant (KD)
was observed to be 5.5 nM.

cold NAC. Scatchard plot showing the specific binding of the radiolabeled
compound to the ratio of bound to free for A549 cells.

Na+-Dependent/-Independent Efflux
Study
Amino acid efflux studies were conducted with and without
the presence
of Na+ to assess the specificity of 68Ga-ATRIDAT-NAC
for its transporter associated with uptake by A549 cells. This experiment
was performed with the control set where no amino acid was added in
the buffer solutions. It is worthwhile to note that the transport
kinetics was similar to that of cysteine. The addition of Na+ has shown a pattern of efflux in the presence of other amino acids
including alanine, DOPA, phenyl alanine, and glutamine. The replacement
of Na+ by choline showed slightly decreased the uptake
of 68Ga-ATRIDAT-NAC in cysteine-containing buffer solution.
There was 90% efflux of 68Ga-ATRIDAT-NAC as compared to
control in the case of Na+ and cysteine-containing solution,
whereas 83% efflux in the case of Na+-independent conditions
(Figure 4). The results
suggested that 68Ga-ATRIDAT-NAC is primarily transported
and mediated mainly by L type with minor transport system ASC.

acids in sodium-containing and sodium-absent media in A549 cells at t = 60 min at 25 °C. The experiment was performed in
duplicates in 3 sets with control, n = 3, values
are mean ± SD.

Incorporation of 68Ga-ATRIDAT-NAC into Proteins
This experiment was done to
check the influence of S-alkylation
on the amino acid-based radioligand incorporation in the protein segments.
Less than 2% radioactivity was found in samples precipitated with
trichloroacetic acid (TCA) in the acid insoluble fraction after 30
min incubation with 68Ga-ATRIDAT-NAC. Almost all the activity
was retained in the acidic fraction. Incorporation of 68Ga-ATRIDAT-NAC into protein was not observed.

Blood Kinetics, μPET
Imaging, and Biodistribution
The blood clearance study was
performed in rats till 4 h. It showed
rapid clearance of the radioligand, 68Ga-ATRIDAT-NAC from
blood with 31.99% remaining after 30 min. After 30 min, the compound
showed gradual clearance from the blood with 19.8% remaining at 2
h and 16.3% remaining at 4 h (see the Supporting Information, Figure S13).

μPET scanning was carried
out to evaluate the potential of 68Ga-ATRIDAT-NAC to target
A549 tumor cells xenograft in the forelimb of athymic mice for diagnostic
applications. An increased uptake of the radiotracer at the tumor
site was seen which improved with time as compared to other organs.
In vivo μPET scans of A549 xenograft in nude mice showed high
localization of 68Ga-ATRIDAT-NAC at the desired site, while
there was minimal activity accumulation in the blood pool organs (Figure 5). A slight uptake
at the kidney and liver sites was seen at 1 h which decreased further
when seen in the 2 h delayed images. Low retention in liver and kidneys
was observed because of the hydrophilic nature of the radioconjugate.
The regions of interest (ROIs) as calculated semiquantitatively have
shown 95.23 kBq/mm3 of the dose in tumor, whereas in the
kidney and liver, the doses were found to be 19.72 and 2.66 kBq/mm3 respectively (Table 1). The tumor-to-kidney ratio of 4.8 and tumor-to-liver ratio
of 35.85 were achieved.

Biodistribution studies
were carried out at different time intervals,
namely, 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 h. The path of excretion was observed to
be kidneys with 7.67 ± 1.48% ID/g accumulation at 30 min after
which the radioactivity in the kidneys declined considerably at 1
h with 2.08 ± 0.66 and 0.52 ± 0.08% ID/g retaining at 4
h. The brain showed less than 0.1% at all time intervals. The uptake
in the bone was also negligible at all time points with 0.19 ±
0.07% ID/g at 30 min, the highest uptake value. The radioconjugate
showed accretion of 4.15 ± 0.16% ID/g at 0.5 h in the liver which
decreased to 0.38 ± 0.09 and 0.16 ± 0.04% ID/g at 1 and
4 h, respectively. The log P value plays a pivotal
role in deciding the fate of excretion and formation of cationic species.

The log P value of −2.89 was obtained for
[68Ga-ATRIDAT-NAC] because of which it followed the renal
route of excretion followed by excretion through the liver. The tumor/kidney
and tumor/liver ratios at different time intervals are shown in Table 2. Less than 0.5% uptake
was observed in the stomach. In tumor, a considerable uptake of 2.47
± 0.16% ID/g at 30 min was seen and rapid accumulation with a
value of 10.06 ± 1.05% ID/g at 1 h. Further, a decrease of activity
was seen at 2 h with 6.80 ± 0.57% ID/g value which reduced to
4.52 ± 0.61% ID/g at 4 h (Figure 6). The biodistribution statistics shows speedy clearance
of the radiolabeled probe from the blood pool and other vital tissues.
Apart from hydrophilic nature of the compound, the alkylated thiol
group helps in reducing accumulation of activity in the background
regions. This results in amplification of the signal at the tumor
site.

Conclusions
A
new S-alkylated radioligand, 68Ga-ATRIDAT-NAC, was
synthesized, characterized, and preclinically assessed as a candidate
agent for PET imaging. The synthesized compound was stable in human
serum, possessing high binding affinity to A549 cells with 5.5 nM
of KD and desirable tumor cell kinetics.
Previous cysteine and methionine analogues with free thiol groups
act as reactive species and get involved in different protein and
nonprotein cycles. Herein, we alkylated the thiol group to avoid any
side reactions to give high tumor to blood counts. A substantial accumulation
of 68Ga-ATRIDAT-NAC at the tumor site validates its targeting
efficiency at the desired site and therefore marks its potential as
a PET diagnostic agent. ATRIDAT-NAC is very efficiently carried by
the amino acid transport systems known to overexpress in the tumor
cells. It was inferred that the uptake was mostly due to L-type with
minor assistance from ASC transporters. A high uptake of radioactivity
at the desired site, a pharmacokinetically stable radioligand with
a simpler Ga-68 radiopharmacy gives a great alternative to the already
known C-11 and F-18 radiotracers.

ethyl acetate (containing 500 mol % of HCl), compound 1 (200 mg, 0.36 mmol) was added and stirred for 4–5 h in a
round-bottom flask at room temperature. The product starts to precipitates
out in ethyl acetate as the reaction progresses. Completion of reaction
was checked through TLC for complete consumption of the reactant.
Ethyl acetate was then decanted and the product dried in vacuo to

Radiolabeling
of the Compound
Radiolabeling was performed
using the previously published method.3068Ga (T1/2 value of 68 min
and positron emission of 89%) was fractionated from a 68Ge to 68Ga generator. In the generator, 68Ge
(half-life = 270 days) is adsorbed on the titanium dioxide-based inorganic
matrix. A total of 5 mL of 0.1 N HCl was injected into the generator
to elute 68Ga(III) from the matrix column. The middle fraction
was used for radiolabeling to minimize 68Ge breakthrough.
HCl (12 N, 1.25 mL) was added to the eluate to obtain a 5 N solution
of [GaCl4]−. Dowex-1 of a 200–400
mesh size (50 mg) anion exchange resin was set for trapping Ga in
the gallium chloride [GaCl4]− form. Thereafter, 68Ga3+ elution was accomplished with water. This
carrier-free solution was used for hot labeling. CH3COONa
was used to make the pH ≈ 4. To it, 20 μmol of ATRIDAT-NAC
was added, and the resulting mixture was heated at 90 °C for
a duration of 10 min. It was then cooled to room temperature and subjected
to a C-18 cartridge purification (preconditioned with ethanol and
water and air-dried). 68Ga(III) was washed away with water,
and the radiolabeled compound was retained on the cartridge. The 68Ga(III)-labeled ATRIDAT-NAC was eluted with 60% ethanol.
ITLC-SG was done to estimate the radiochemical yield in 15% ammonium
acetate/methanol in the ratio of 1:4 as the mobile phase. The ITLC
was scanned and analyzed with the OmniScan EZ-TLC scanner and PeakSimple
3.0, respectively.

Cytotoxicity of NAC-ATRIDAT
Cytotoxicity
was assessed
in the A549 cells using the MTT assay. Cells growing exponentially
at a uniform cell density of 4000–5000 cells/well were plated
in a 96-well microtiter plate. Cells were treated with increasing
concentrations of the test compound (pM to mM range) at intervals
of 24, 48 and 72 h. At the end of treatment, negative control and
treated cells were incubated with MTT (0.05 mg/mL) for 2 h at 37 °C,
and the medium was removed. Triplicate wells were lysed, and 150 μL
of DMSO was added to dissolve the formazan crystals. Optical density
of 150 μL extracts was measured at 570 nm (reference filter:
630 nm). Surviving fraction for the concentration range was plotted
against the concentration for ATRIDAT-NAC.

Human Serum Stability Evaluation
Blood was taken from
healthy persons (volunteers) and allowed to clot for 1 h at 37 °C
in a humidified incubator maintained at 5% CO2 balanced
with 95% air. After clotting, the blood was centrifuged at 400 g.
The serum was filtered through a 0.22 μm syringe filter. To
900 μL of human serum, 100 μL of the radiolabeled compound
was added and placed in a CO2 chamber incubated at 37 °C.
ITLC was analyzed for dissociation of the complex in the ratio of
1:4 of the 15% ammonium acetate/MeOH solvent system.

log P
In a presaturated solution of
500 μL each of 1-octanol and PBS, a solution of 20 μL
of 68Ga-labeled-ATRIDAT-NAC (50 μM) was added. The
presaturated solution containing the 68Ga-labeled-ATRIDAT-NAC
was vortexed and centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 min. The two phases
were separated, and the radioactivity in a volume of 100 μL
from each layer was measured in γ-counter. The experiments were
carried out in triplicate. This method is adopted from the previously
published article.33

Blood Kinetics
The blood kinetics study was performed
in female Wistar rat (∼230 g) to analyze the kinetics of radioconjugate
clearance from the blood after circulation. 68Ga-ATRIDAT-NAC
(1 MBq) was injected in the blood stream through the tail vein of
the female Wistar rat. The blood samples (200 μL) were collected
from the occular vein through capillary at different time intervals
(10–240 min), and counts were measured on a gamma counter.
Calculations were done assuming the 64 mL/kg blood volume of the rat.
Data are given as percentage injected dose (% ID) at different time
frames.

Cell uptake Studies
For cell uptake studies, 0.3 ×
106 cells were seeded in DMEM supplemented medium in 24-well
culture plates which were incubated overnight. On the next day, the
cells/well were counted. The growth medium was replaced by HBSS prior
to the experiment. The cells were incubated with the 0.37 MBq of the
radiolabeled compound (500 μL) and incubated at 37 °C for
60 min. To terminate the uptake, the tracer solution was removed,
and cells were washed with ice-cold PBS. The cells were lysed with
0.2 N NaOH (500 μL), and the radioactivity associated with the
cells was counted using the γ-counter. The results were presented
as percentage dose per 105 cells (all values were decay
corrected).

Cell Binding Studies
Monolayer cultures
of the A549
cell line were grown in normal DMEM, supplemented with 10% FBS. The
monolayers were washed with HBSS and left in HBSS for 2 h at 37 °C
prior to the conduct of the experiment. Saturation and displacement
experiments were carried out at 37 °C. Cells were incubated for
1 h with (1 pM to 10 μM) concentration of 68Ga-ATRIDAT-NAC
with and without the presence of the unlabeled NAC (100 folds excess)
to calculate the total and nonspecific binding, respectively. The
monolayers were washed with PBS four times after the incubation time.
The radioactivity associated with the cells was determined on a gamma
counter. Specific binding was calculated by substracting nonbinding
fraction from the total binding.

Time Course and Transport
Kinetics of 68Ga-ATRIDAT-NAC
The time course of
the 68Ga-ATRIDAT-NAC uptake was measured
by treating the cells with 10 μM of the radiolabeled compound
in HEPES-buffered Krebs solution (0.5 mL; 37 °C) for different
time interval ranges (30 s to 60 min). Transport of the radiolabeled
compound was stopped by removing the radioconjugate and washing three
times with PBS. The total activity in cells was measured as stated
above in the cell uptake study. A549 cells were incubated for 10 min
in HEPES-buffered Krebs solution (50 μL; 37 °C) with concentrations
(0.005–0.1 μM) of 68Ga-ATRIDAT-NAC for kinetic
experiments. The data are plotted using the Michaelis–Menten
equation.

Selectivity and Sodium Ion Dependency of
Transport
The inhibition of 68Ga-ATRIDAT-NAC transport
by amino
acids in competition was studied in two different conditions. In the
first, cells were incubated with Krebs solution and 10 μM solution
of 68Ga-ATRIDAT-NAC. In second, inhibition studies were
carried with Na+-free Krebs solution by substituting sodium
salts (NaCl, NaHCO3, and NaH2PO4)
with its choline and potassium analogues (choline chloride, choline
bicarbonate, and KH2PO4). A549 cells were treated
with 68Ga-ATRIDAT-NAC for 1 h at 37 °C in standard
Krebs buffer. After incubation, cells were rinsed and treated with
Krebs buffer (standard and modified) consisting of 1 mM of either l-alanine, l-cysteine, DOPA, l-phenyl alanine,
or l-glutamine in the group of 4 sets. After 1 h, cells were
washed with PBS thrice, followed by the addition of lysis buffer and
counts were taken of all the fractions. 68Ga-ATRIDAT-NAC
efflux was stated as percent of radioactivity effluxed from the cells.

Incorporation of 68Ga-ATRIDAT-NAC into Proteins
The incorporation of 68Ga-ATRIDAT-NAC into protein was
done in concordance to the previously published protocol with slight
modifications.26,28 For radioligand incorporation
in proteins, the samples were treated with 1 MBq (500 μL) of 68Ga-ATRIDAT-NAC at 37 °C for 30 min. At the completion
of treatment, the radioactive media were removed, followed by cell
washing with 1 mL ice-cold PBS thrice. The cells were dislodged using
0.5 mL EDTA (1%), and 0.5 mL of 20% TCA was added to the cells. The
samples were kept for 10 min on ice prior to centrifugation at 10
000 rpm for 5 min. The pellet obtained was washed thrice with ice
cold PBS. The radioactivity associated with the pellet and the supernatant
was quantified by a gamma counter. 68Ga-ATRIDAT-NAC integration
in the proteins was calculated as the percentage of radioactivity
in the precipitated fraction after the TCA addition.

Biodistribution
Studies in Tumor Xenograft Mice Models
Biodistribution studies
were done on athymic mice after 10 days of
tumor inoculation. The biodistribution of the radiolabeled compound
was assessed in A549 tumor xenograft mice after intravenous injection
of 100 μL of saline holding 1 MBq of 68Ga-ATRIDAT-NAC.
After 30, 60, 120, and 240 min injection of the 68Ga-ATRIDAT-NAC,
mice (n = 3) for each time interval were sacrificed
by cervical dislocation following CO2 administration. Organs
were harvested and washed with saline and dried on blotting sheets.
Organs were then weighed, and the radioactivity in the whole organ
was measured by a gamma counter. Percent injected dose per gram of
tissues was calculated and plotted.

PET Imaging Studies in
Tumor Xenograft Mice Models
The PET imaging study was performed
on anesthetized animals by breathing
of 2% isoflurane dissolved in oxygen (2 L/min). Each mouse was given 68Ga-ATRIDAT-NAC (30 MBq) intravenously in 100 μL of
saline intravenously. CT scan was taken of the respective animals
for the anatomical frame prior to PET acquisitions at 1, 2, and 4
h after radioactivity injection. Reconstruction of PET scans was done
using 20–50 iterations of the maximum likelihood expectation
maximization algorithm. Coregistration of PET and CT was done on AMIRA,
and semiquantitative analysis was done using AMIDE. Data are stated
as activity in kBq per mm3 of the tissue.
