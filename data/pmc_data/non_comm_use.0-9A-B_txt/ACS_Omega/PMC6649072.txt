α-l-Rhamnosidases are catalysts of industrial tremendous
interest, but their uses are still somewhat limited by their poor
thermal stabilities and selectivities. The thermophilic DtRha from Dictyoglomus thermophilum was cloned, and the recombinant protein was easily purified to homogeneity
to afford 4.5 mg/L culture of biocatalyst. Michaelis–Menten
parameters demonstrated it to be fully specific for α-l-rhamnose. Most significantly, DtRha demonstrated
to have a stronger preference for α(1 → 2) linkage rather
than α(1 → 6) linkage when removing rhamnosyl moiety
from natural flavonoids. This selectivity was fully explained by the
difference of binding of the corresponding substrates in the active
site of the protein.

Introduction
α-l-Rhamnosidases
(E.C. 3.2.1.40) are ubiquitous
enzymes in nature and are responsible for the removal of the α-l-rhamnose (α-l-Rha) entity from various glycoconjugates.
Indeed, α-l-Rha is widely distributed in plants and
bacteria as polysaccharide residue (pectins, O-antigen
of pathogenic bacteria) in glycosylated derivatives (flavonoids and
terpenes) or biosurfactants (rhamnolipids).1 The α-l-Rha motif is, in addition, widely found in
surface glycoproteins of bacteria and therefore participates in the
virulence of the pathogen. Conversely, it is rarely described to form
a direct bond with an amino acid (unlike glucose, mannose, galactose,
...) because, at present, only few examples refer to this type of
rare glycosylation.2 Since many years,
rhamnosidases have also been used as biocatalysts in numerous industrial
processes. In the food industry, they have been used for production
of fruit juice or for the improvement of wine aroma by deglycosylation
of terpenes. Thus, α-l-Rha products can be directly
valorized in the chemical industry as chiral precursors in synthesis
or for the glycodiversification of products.3 α-l-Rhamnosidases are also widely exploited in the
pharmaceutical industry for flavonoid derhamnosylation (see Figure 1). Indeed, these
compounds are recognized for their beneficial effects on health in
humans, and it has been shown that monoglycosylated compounds have
better bioavailability than their disaccharide analogues.4,5 For example, (1) prunin, the derhamnosylated product of 1 or 2, was recently described to have a strong effect
on the inhibition of enzyme systems related to diabetes;6 (2) diosmetin 7-O-glucoside
(from 3 and 4) was reported to have cardiovascular
and hepatoprotective effects, as well as antioxidant, antiarrhythmic,
and anticomplementay activities;7 (3) quercetin
7-O-glucopyranoside (from 5 and 6) has demonstrated its potency in inhibiting the viral RNA
polymerase from influenza A and B viruses;8 and (4) hesperetin 7-O-glucoside (from 7 and 8) has been shown to inhibit the growth of Helicobacter pylori, a causative agent for gastric
diseases.9 Unfortunately, the majority
of them have a low occurrence in nature or are difficult to isolate
from plant sources, and their chemical syntheses remain tedious, with
all consequences leading to expensive natural compounds.

Figure 1 Natural glycosylated
flavonoids used as substrates in this study.

All reported α-l-rhamnosidases act following
a mechanism
of inversion of configuration, and they are listed in three CAZy glycoside
hydrolase (GH) families (GH28, GH78 and GH106, http://www.cazy.org/, accessed November
2018).10 Unlike GH28 and GH106 families
containing α-l-rhamnosidases that are involved in pectin
metabolism, GH78 family is composed of α-l-rhamnosidases
exhibiting valuable activities in natural product synthesis. Indeed,
several characterized GH78 α-l-rhamnosidases have been
demonstrated to catalyze the hydrolysis of rhamnosides bound to flavonoid
glucosides with a wide diversity of linkage regioselectivity on the
glucose: α(1 → 2), α(1 → 6), and more rarely,
α(1 → 3).11−16 However, if some differences in bond selectivity for hydrolysis
were reported in these studies, then no rational understanding of
such substrate specificity could be analyzed. This was likely due
to the small number of four GH78 structures that are currently available
in the Protein Data Bank. The corresponding proteins have been isolated
from Bacillus sp. GL1,1Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron,15Streptomyces avermitilis,17 and Klebsiella oxytoca.18

With the objective of using
of α-l-rhamnosidases
as industrial biocatalysts, thermostability is highly advantageous
and looked for because it is correlated with a higher resistance of
the enzyme toward increased incubation time and temperature, as well
as a higher tolerance to nonaqueous solvents. However, few of the
characterized ones are from thermophilic microorganisms: Thermomicrobium sp. (RhmA and RhmB),19Clostridium
stercorarium (RamA),15 and Aspergillus terreus.5 In this
context, we have identified a thermophilic bacteria, Dictyoglomus
thermophilum,20,21 which possesses a single gene
on its genome, dicth_0289, coding for potential exo-α-l-rhamnosidase. The corresponding enzyme DtRha identified by B5YC64 (UniProt identification) has a sequence
identity of 35% with the crystallized one from S. avermitilis (3W5M, PDB identification).

In the course of our ongoing research
devoted to the discovery
of original and robust biocatalysts for the chemoenzymatic synthesis
of natural compounds,22−24 we thus got interested in the cloning, overexpression,
and purification of this thermophilic DtRha. Owing
to enzymology, 3D structure determination using X-ray diffraction,
and modeling experiments, we were able to show the substrate versatility
of this α-l-rhamnosidase and to fully demonstrate the
requirement for its efficient recognition of glycosylated flavonoid.
These experiments led to the development of a cheap and easy access
to very expensive flavonoids such as prunin, diosmetin, or hesperetin
7-O-glucopyranoside.

Results and Discussion
Gene Cloning
and Protein Overexpression
The 2763 bp dicth_0289 gene was amplified from D. thermophilum genomic DNA from the constructed primers to allow insertion between
the NheI/SalI restriction sites
of the vector pET28-a(+). The corresponding recombinant plasmid was
transformed in E. coli Rosetta-(DE3),
and the protein was expressed after isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside
(IPTG) induction of the bacterial culture in the nutrient medium LB/Kan/Cam
at 37 °C for 20 h. After lysis, thermal clarification, and purification
on a Ni-NTA column, the purified enzyme was analyzed on 1D 10% SDS-PAGE
gel (Figure S1). The protein consists of
a sequence of 921 acids that represents a theoretical molecular weight
of 106 kDa, with the presence of six His motifs (from His-tag), and
gel analysis confirmed the purity of the protein because a single
band was observed at the level of the 100 kDa reference protein band.
The production yield of the protein DtRha is 4.5
mg/L bacterial culture.

Biochemical Characterization of DtRha
Purified DtRha enzyme was further used
to assess
its catalytic activity. The kinetic parameters were evaluated by monitoring
the hydrolytic activity of the enzyme toward 20 different p-nitrophenyl-sugars (pNP-sugars, Figure S2). Potentially cleaved pNP could be easily quantified at
405 nm. Among them, only pNP-α-l-Rha demonstrated to
be a substrate, thus confirming the unique carbohydrate specificity
of DtRha. The values of optimum pH and temperature
were determined to be 5.0 and 95 °C, respectively (see Figure S3). Indeed, the enzymatic activity is
favored for a large range of acidic pH between 4.0 and 7.0, as similarly
demonstrated for previously reported α-l-rhamnosidases.5,15 The Michaelis–Menten parameters were thus determined at pH
5.0 and at 37 °C. Under these conditions, the KM value was evaluated at 54.00 ± 0.03 μM and
the kcat one at 0.17 ± 0.01 s–1 (Table 1 and Figure S4). Compared to other recombinant
α-l-rhamnosidases from the GH78 family, DtRha is one of the best enzymes for the recognition of pNP-α-l-Rha but catalyzes its conversion very slowly at 37 °C
(indeed, its relative activity is 17% compared to that at 90 °C).
However, a poor activity on unnatural aryl rhamnosides is a not a
predictor at all for its enzymatic activity on rhamnosyl flavonoids,
as demonstrated by Grandits et al.25DtRha is also proven to be very tolerant to a variety of
solvent mixtures (CH3CN, DMSO, and DMF), especially to
30 % aqueous MeOH, in which the enzyme kept up to 50% of its activity
(see Figure S5). All these parameters are
compatible with efficient biocatalyzed synthesis and encouraged us
to probe the hydrolytic properties of DtRha on natural
flavonoids.

Determination
of the Substrate Specificity
α-l-Rhamnosidases
from GH78 family are well described for their
potency to remove α-l-Rha from flavonoids (see, for
example, Table 1).
However, in the vast majority of the previously published studies,
the aglycone part of the flavonoids was not the same, and it thus
remains difficult to compare the α(1 → 2) and/or α(1
→ 6) selectivity of the different enzymes on similar natural
molecules. Here, we were thus encouraged, for the first time, to systematically
probe DtRha for its α(1 → 2) and/or
α(1 → 6) selectivity using flavanone (Figure 1, 1 and 2), flavone (Figure 1, 3 and 4) and isoflavonoid (Figure 1, 5 to 8) aglycones. Results of the catalyzed hydrolysis for two
different concentrations of DtRha are summarized
in Table 2. At low
concentration, it is noteworthy that α(1 → 2)-rhamnosylated
flavonoids (neohesperidosides) demonstrated to be more efficient substrates
than their α(1 → 6) counterparts (rutinosides), whatever
the aglycone moiety. Moreover, at slightly increased concentration
of DtRha, naringin 1 and neoeriocitrin 5 were the most efficiently transformed, with a conversion
rate higher than 95% in 3 h under our reaction conditions. On the
contrary, even in the case of 10 times higher DtRha
concentration, conversion rates were limited to 40% for α(1
→ 6) derivatives. Therefore, DtRha is specific
to α(1 → 2) glycosidic linkage rather than α(1
→ 6) linkage, with ratio going up to 4 in terms of conversion
rate. In addition, the aglycone part still seems to have an influence
on the recognition and velocity of the enzyme, with the flavonone
of narigin 1 being preferred. Flavonoids containing methoxy
groups on their aromatic rings were the less favored substrates (see
compounds 3, 4, 7, and 8) compared to phenol derivatives (1, 2, 5, and 6). Therefore, the enzymatic preferences
in terms of aglycons are in this decreasing order: flavanone, isoflavonoid
(phenol group), flavone, and isoflavonoid.

a Reactions were performed according
to conditions described in Experimental Procedures and analyzed by reverse-phase HPLC to quantify the conversion rate
(percentage of substrate hydrolyzed by DtRha) (Figures S6–S13), and products were characterized
by HRMS (Figures S14–S17).

Resolution of the 3D Structure of DtRha
Crystals of DtRha suitable
for diffraction were
obtained with 30% PEG 1500 using sitting drop vapor diffusion. The
structure was refined to 2.7 Å using α-l-rhamnosidase SaRha from S. avermitilis (PDB 3W5M) as the replacement model.17 Two protein monomers are visible in the asymmetric crystal unit.
However, according to PISA server analysis,27DtRha is a single monomer, which is supported by
size-exclusion chromatography analysis (data not shown). The overall
structure of DtRha is similar to those observed for
some other reported GH78 α-l-rhamnosidases: SaRha from S. avermitilis (PDB 3W5M and 3W5N)17 and RhaB from Bacillus sp. GL1 (PDB 2OKX)1 and B. thetaiotaomicron (3CIH). DtRha
is composed of five distinct domains, namely, domain N (1–125),
domain E (126–317), domain F (348–437), catalytic domain
A (438–813), and domain C (814–921). The loop 658–694
could not be refined because of poor electronic density. When aligning
the putative DtRha active site to the SaRha active site, most residues surrounding the active site are conserved,
especially the catalytic residues, namely, the catalytic acid E479
(E636 in SaRha) and the catalytic base E782 (E895
in SaRha) (Figure 2).

residues
are indicated by arrows. (B) Superimposition of active sites of DtRha and SaRha78 from S. avermitilis. Residues are respectively colored in orange and gray. Numbers indicate
the residue from DtRha and the corresponding residues

Docking of Rhamnosylated
Flavonoids in DtRha
Active Site
Using the DtRha crystal structure
as a starting model, the missing 658–694 loop was rebuilt by
several cycles of molecular dynamics, followed by energy minimization.
Once a full DtRha model was available, three ligands
were chosen to identify the structural interactions that lead to differences
in enzymatic activity. Naringin 1 was chosen as a representative
efficient substrate, bearing a neohesperidose glycan unit containing
an α(1 → 2)-linked rhamnose on a naringenin aglycon moiety.
Narirutin 2, bearing the same aglycon—but linked
to rutinose disaccharide—exhibiting an α(1 → 6)-linked
rhamnose, was also chosen a weak substrate. Eriocitrin 6, a quasi-ineffective substrate in low enzymatic concentration, also
bearing a rutinoside moiety on eryodictyol aglycon, was selected in
docking analyses. All three substrates were docked using soft-restrained
molecular dynamics, as previously reported for other enzymes,28−30 and minimized final snapshots are depicted in Figure 3. Narirutin and eriocitrin exhibited similar
interactions in the active site, involving some H-bonding between
rhamnoside hydroxyls O2 and O3 with carboxylic residues (namely, D473,
E479, and E782). On the other hand, naringin is tightly bound to the DtRha active site. Rhamnose O3 is H-bonded to NE1 from W538, and O2 is H-bonded to D473, R477, and E782. The latter
residue also bridges O3 from the glucoside moiety, strongly stabilizing
the disaccharide in the active site. Two other stabilizing H-bonds
between R783 and O3 and O4 from glucose are visible, which strongly
increase the stabilization of the complex. Finally, the aglycon conformation
enables the H-bond between the hydroxyl and the Y587 residue and π-stacking
between F144 and the aromatic ring of the naringin. These differences
in H-bond networks between naringin and narirutin (as well as eriocitrin)
can be explained by the nature of the glycosidic bond between rhamnose
and glucose. In other words, neohesperidoside conformation helps to
interact with the DtRha active site, whereas rutinoside
does not provide a conformation that leads to H-bonds. A similar analysis
based on molecular dynamics and computational studies on Ram2 α-l-rhamnosidase from Pediococcus acidilactici was used to demonstrate the peculiar specificity of this enzyme
for rhamnose-bound glucose compared to aryl aglycons such as pNP-α-l-Rha, correlated to a difference in substrate binding and orientation
in the active site.25

Conclusions
The search for efficient,
thermostable, and robust biocatalysts
is still an ongoing quest in the biotechnological field for numerous
industrial applications. An original α-l-rhamnosidase
was cloned from D. thermophilum and
purified to homogeneity with good yields. It proved to be very efficient
up to 90 °C and in complex solvents’ mixture. Despite
its moderate efficiency toward the hydrolysis of pNP-α-l-Rha, we were able to demonstrate its advantage for the enzymatic
synthesis of expensive and natural compounds with biological properties.
Of tremendous interest, for the first time, we report here, to our
knowledge, the structural requirements that explain why DtRha possesses an α(1 → 2) toward α(1 →
6) preference during the hydrolysis of α-l-Rha from
flavonoids. In addition, this particular enzyme proves to be very
versatile toward the aglycone moiety. Besides these fundamental observations,
such enzymatic properties of DtRha pave the way for
the industrial development of high-scale preparation of prunin, diosmetin,
or hesperetin 7-O-glucopyranoside.

Experimental
Procedures
Materials
All p-nitrophenyl monosaccharides
(pNP-sugars) were purchased from Carbosynth (Compton, U.K.). All chemicals
used were of analytical reagent grade. Phusion High-Fidelity DNA polymerase
was purchased from Thermo Fisher and pET-28a(+) from Novagen.

DtRha Cloning, Expression, and Purification
The
open reading frame encoding DtRha (DICTH_0289)
was amplified from D. thermophilum DSM
3960 genomic DNA (DSMZ Institute, Germany) by PCR using Phusion High-Fidelity
DNA polymerase (Thermo Fisher) using the following primers: 5′-ttgctagcatgaagtcaagtaatatttactcaccctt-3′ and 5′-ttgtcgacttatatcttttccatataaaagttgtatgatcc-3′. These
primers respectively enabled the insertion of NheI and SalI restriction sites up- and downstream
of the gene. After enzymatic digestion, PCR amplicon was directly
ligated into pET-28a(+) vector using T4 DNA Ligase (Rapid DNA ligation
kit, Fermentas), and the final construct pDtRha-28 was transformed
in E. coli DH5α for amplification.
pDtRha-28 plasmid was then transformed in Rosetta(DE3) expression
strain. After selection on antibiotics, a single colony of transformed
cells was used to inoculate LB broth medium containing the appropriate
antibiotics. Cells were grown at 37 °C with 250 rpm shaking until
OD600 reached 0.6, and IPTG (200 μM final concentration)
was added before overnight incubation at 37 °C. Cells were harvested,
resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mM Tris (pH 8.0), 200 mM NaCl, and
0.1% Triton X-100), incubated with lysozyme (0.1 mg/mL) at 4 °C
for 20 min, and lysed by several freeze–thaw cycles, followed
by ultrasonication. After the centrifugation step (32,000g for 20 min), clarification of supernatant was carried out by heat
treatment (15 min at 70 °C) to remove nonthermostable proteins.
Final centrifugation (32,000g for 20 min) was done,
and supernatant was used for chemoenzymatic synthesis.

Enzyme Activity
Assays
DtRha activity
was assayed at 37 °C in 200 μL reaction mixtures containing
substrates (0.01–10 mM), 0.425 μg enzyme, and Tris buffer
(200 mM, pH 6.0). Residual spontaneous hydrolysis of the substrate
was determined on a sample containing H2O instead of enzyme.
For p-nitrophenol (pNP)-containing substrates, after
30 min reaction, 100 μL sodium carbonate (1 M) was added, and
produced pNP was quantified by absorbance measurement at 405 nm. All
kinetics parameters were calculated by fitting of saturation curves
(as the mean of triplicate measurements) with standard Michaelis–Menten
equation using Prism 6 (GraphPad).

Effect of pH and Temperature
on DtRha Activity
The optimum pH for DtRha was determined by measuring
pNP-α-l-Rha hydrolysis under several pH values ranging
from pH 4.0 to 10.0. The buffers used were as follows: acid citric/sodium
phosphate buffer (200 mM) for pH 4.0 to 6.0, imidazole/HCl buffer
(200 mM) for pH 7.0, Tris/HCl buffer (200 mM) for pH 8.0, tris base
buffer (200 mM) for pH 9.0, and sodium carbonate buffer (200 mM) for
pH 10.0. One hundred microliter samples containing 1 mM pNP-α-l-Rha, 10 μL buffer, and 5 μL diluted DtRha were incubated for 5 min at 37 °C. Then, reactions were
quenched by adding 50 μL Na2CO3 (1 M),
and absorbance was measured at 405 nm. The dependence of the enzyme
activity on temperature was determined by measuring the hydrolysis
of pNP-α-l-Rha for several temperatures ranging from
40 to 100 °C. Samples were prepared following the same protocol
as the pH dependence study but only in 20 mM imidazole-HCl buffer
at pH 6.0. After 5 min incubation, reaction was quenched by adding
50 μL Na2CO3 (1 M), and relative activity
was calculated according to absorbance measured for each temperature
at 405 nm.

Substrate Specificity of Recombinant α-l-Rhamnosidase DtRha
An assay mixture
composed of 100 μL
citric acid-sodium phosphate buffer (0.1 M, pH 6.0), 1 mM substrate,
and 0.05 mg/mL DtRha was heated at 50 °C. At
respective times, the reaction mixture was subjected to HPLC analysis
after filtration through a 0.22 μm filter. An Agilent 1220 Infinity
II LC coupled with an Agilent Zorbax Eclipse XDB-C18 column (4.6 ×
150 mm, 3.5 μm) and a diode array detector (DAD) was used to
determine the concentrations of the substrates and products. Following
an injection of 20 μL, the column was eluted with a gradient
elution at 30 °C and kept the flow rate at 0.8 mL/min. The mobile
phase was composed of H2O/0.1% TFA (A) and CH3CN/0.1% TFA (B). The gradient procedure began with A/B = 90:10 within
0–4 min. This procedure was followed by a linear change to
A/B = 20:80 within 4–23 min, maintaining A/B = 20:80 within
23–24 min, and then a linear return to A/B = 90:10 within 24–30
min. The target compounds were captured in DAD at 280 nm, and samples
were analyzed by HRMS.

DtRha Crystallogenesis and
Structure Determination
DtRha was further
purified by immobilized metal-affinity
chromatography (IMAC) and gel filtration before being concentrated
in 20 mM Tris at 10 mg/mL before being used for crystallogenesis assays.
Crystals suitable for diffraction were obtained by sitting drop vapor
diffusion when using 30% PEG 1500 as the crystallization agent. Crystals
were cryprotected using 25% methylpentane-2,4-diol before been frozen
in liquid nitrogen. Data were collected on beamline Proxima-1 at Soleil
Synchrotron Facility, integrated, reduced, and scaled with the X-Ray
Detector Software (XDS).31S. avermitilis α-l-rhamnosidase (PDB
3W5M)17 was then used as a template for
molecular replacement using the PHASER program.32 Refinement and model building were conducted using Phenix33 and COOT.34 Model
quality was assessed at every refinement step using MolProbity.35 The structure of DtRha was
deposited to the Protein Data Bank (PDB code 6I60). Data and final
refinement statistics are listed in Table S1.

Homology Modeling of DtRha and Docking of Ligands
The structure of DtRha was used as a starting
template, and loop 681–712, which was missing in the structure,
was built using COOT. The resulting model was then prepared with AmberTools36 and then equilibrated using the NAMD software37 and AMBER-FB15 force field.38 Docking of rhamnosylated substrates was done by first applying
AM1-BCC charges on the ligand.39 Then,
the ligand was placed 10 Å away, facing the active site (according
to PDB 3W5M and 3W5N). Then, the DtRha–substrate
complex was formed using steered molecular dynamics at 100 K using
the structural alignment of rhamnose in its binding pocket as the
final orientation, according to published procedures.29DtRha backbone was kept constrained during
the whole procedure. Finally, protein–ligand complex models
were equilibrated by releasing substrate constraints and applying
several cycles of energy minimization (10,000 steps, steepest descent),
followed by molecular dynamics (100 K, 1 ns). Final complex models
were obtained by final energy minimization. All structural figures
were drawn using PyMOL Molecular Graphics system 1.6 (www.pymol.org).
