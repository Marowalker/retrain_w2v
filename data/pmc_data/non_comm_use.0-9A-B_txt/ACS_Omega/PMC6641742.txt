Solvothermal reactions of lanthanide
salts and a semirigid tripodal
H3tatab (4,4′,4″-s-triazine-1,3,5-triyltri-p-aminobenzoic acid) ligand in mixed water and N-methyl pyrrolidone (NMP) generated novel breathing MOFs [Ln(tatab)]·solvent
(Ln = Eu in 1-Eu, Tb in 1-Tb, Eu0.015Tb0.985 in 1-Eu0.015Tb0.985). The framework of 1 was contracted upon removal of guests
to form partly desolvated [Ln (tatab)]·3.7H2O·2.5NMP
(1′). Single-crystal X-ray analyses demonstrated
that 1 has the breathing ability to spontaneously release
guests and maintain the same topology. In contrast to as-synthesized 1, the cell volume of 1′ decreased markedly
upon removal of the guests. Different from linear dicarboxylates,
the semirigid tripodal tatab ligand is bridged to an inorganic Ln–O
chain, limiting the rotation around the O–O-axis of carboxylate.
The breathing mechanism is based on the flexible C–N–C
angles of amide bonds in the tatab ligand, causing a change in the
solvent-accessible volume in the framework. Interestingly, the luminescence
color of breathing co-doped lanthanide MOF 1′-Eu0.015Tb0.985 is blue-shifted and turned from orange
to green with an increase in temperature, which can be attributed
to a change in the relative intensity of Tb and Eu emissions, and
is quite different from that observed for the reported related compounds.
The breathing co-doped lanthanide MOF 1′-Eu0.015Tb0.985 can be applied as a high-sensitivity
ratiometric thermometer in a broad temperature from 90 to 300 K.

Introduction
Metal–organic
frameworks (MOFs) have exceptionally high
porosities and versatile structural features that allow for their
applications in a wide range of areas.1−4 Over recent years, breathing MOFs have received
intense attention because they can undergo expansion and contraction
of the void space in the framework upon application of external stimuli,
such as temperature and pressure changes or the inclusion of guest
molecules.5−8 Functionally, breathing MOFs show selective, stepwise, reversible,
and hysteretic adsorption properties.9−11 Structurally, they exhibit
flexibility and unusual dynamic behaviors, which are typically seen
in the MIL-53 family, with rhombic channels built from the interconnection
of infinite chains of trans-corner-sharing MO6 polyhedra
and linear dicarboxylate ions.12−14 The breathing mechanism is generally
activated by rotation around the O–O axis of the carboxylate
(known as the “kneecap”), which requires an opposite
rotation on the opposing side of the rod-like building blocks. On
this account, a large number of researchers choose octahedrally coordinated
metal ions and linear dicarboyxlate ligands rather than tri-topic
ligands.

Lanthanide ions show variable coordination numbers
and geometries,
which, in combination with the tripodal ligand of long arms, may facilitate
the formation of novel breathing lanthanide metal–organic frameworks
(Ln-MOFs). In particular, Ln-MOFs display unique luminescence properties,
such as long luminescent lifetime, large Stokes shifts, characteristically
sharp line emissions, and pure emitting colors.15−17 Actually, Ln-MOFs
have been emerging as a class of very promising luminescence materials
and thermometers due to their fast response and high sensitivity.18−20 With respect to luminescence thermometers, Ln-MOF luminescence thermometers
differ from traditional thermometers and thermocouple thermometers,21,22 which have constraints of application at the molecular scale as
well as under some special conditions, such as strong electromagnetism.
To date, luminescent thermometers of Ln-MOFs have mainly focused on
those with single transition emission, and can thus easily be affected
by the excitation power, variation in sensors, and drifts of optoelectronic
systems.23,24 Recently, ratiometric thermometers based
on the intensity ratio of two independent transitions from different
lanthanides have attracted the attention of researchers due to enhanced
sensitivity for accurate temperature sensing.25−27 It should be
noted that, to date, these kinds of ratiometric thermometers are limited
to rigid mixed Eu3+/Tb3+ MOFs, where luminescence
color redshifts from green of Tb to red of Eu with an increase in
temperature as a result of energy transfer from Tb to Eu.28−30 Are there abnormalities in the relationship between luminescence
and temperature in mixed Eu3+/Tb3+ MOFs? To
address this question, we focus our attention on breathing Eu3+/Tb3+ MOFs, as breathing effects of Eu3+/Tb3+ MOFs with temperature may induce some change in
host frameworks and guest molecules, which may further induce changes
in luminescence arising from energy variations,31 lifetimes,32,33 and the relative emission intensity
of Tb, Eu, and organic ligand.

As is well known, to fulfil the
luminescent properties of Eu3+/Tb3+ mixed MOF
thermometers, the organic linkers
need to have a suitable triplet excited state energy in the range
of 22 000–24 000 cm–1 to match
the energy of the main accepting level of Eu3+(5D1, 19 030 cm–1) and Tb3+(5D4, 20 500 cm–1)
(Scheme 1).34,35

In this work, we study the reaction of a tripodal carboxylate ligand,
namely, H3tatab (4,4′,4″-s-triazine-1,3,5-triyltri-p-aminobenzoic acid), with
Tb(NO3)3/Eu(NO3)3 in mixed
solvents of N-methyl pyrrolidone (NMP) and water
generated three-dimensional (3D) breathing Ln-MOFs, including single
lanthanide 1-Eu and 1-Tb and mixed doped 1-Eu0.015Tb0.985 with one-dimensional
(1D) channels. Upon standing or with a change in temperature, the
Ln-MOFs show breathing effects involving the removal of guest molecules.
Although the breathing Ln-MOFs are isostructural to the reported {[Tb2(TATAB)2]·4H2O·6DMF}n,36 the newly synthesized
breathing Ln-MOFs, with replacement of the mixed solvent DMF/H2O with NMP/H2O, is more stable. In particular,
the crystals that we obtained could be measured at room temperature,
whereas the previously reported crystals could only be measured at
low temperatures.

Fortunately, mixed Ln-MOF 1′-Eu0.015Tb0.985 can function as a ratiometric
thermometer with
high sensitivity based on the intensity ratio between emission of
Tb3+ at 545 nm and Eu3+ at 614 nm, and can be
used in a broad temperature range from 90 to 300 K. In particular,
different from reported Eu/Tb luminescent thermometers, such as Eu0.0069Tb0.9931-DMBDC,37 the luminescence color of 1′-Eu0.015Tb0.985 gradually blueshift, rather than redshift, with
increasing temperature.

Results and Discussion
Structural Description
Primrose yellow single crystals
of 1-Eu and 1-Tb as well as co-doped 1-Eu0.015Tb0.985 were obtained by the
reaction of H3tatab with Ln3+ at 150 °C
for 5 days under solvothermal conditions. After continually optimizing
the experiment conditions, a procedure was found that repeatedly yielded
large crystals. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction and IR spectra revealed
that a series of lanthanide MOFs and co-doped lanthanide MOFs were
isomorphous (Figure S1). Here, 1-Eu is taken as an example to describe the structure in detail (Figure 1). 1-Eu crystallizes in the monoclinic space group P21/c, and the asymmetric unit comprises
two europium ions and one triply deprotonated tatab ligand. Both Eu(III)
ions adopt the same coordination geometry, each coordinated with eight
oxygen atoms from two tatab ligands (Figure 1a). The Eu–O distances are in the
range 2.289(12)–2.612(11) Å, which are comparable to those
in the related europium complexes.29 The
Eu(1) and Eu(2) polyhedra are edge-shared to extend an inorganic Eu–O
chain (Figure 1b).
The tatab ligand is coordinated to six Eu ions, with six carboxylate
oxygen atoms in the μ6-η1:η:1η:1η:2η1:η2 mode (Figure 1c). The adjacent chains are further linked by tatab
ligands to a 2D layered motif, with the formula of Eu(tatab)0.5 parallel to the c-axis direction, in which semirigid
tripodal tatab ligands act as Δ-shaped pillars (Figure 1d). It should be noted that the adjacent two tatab ligands among the
Eu–O chains are bridged to an inversion center (Figure 1e). The Eu(tatab)0.5 layers are further pillared by an additional tatab ligand to result
in a 3D open framework with parallelogram channels along the c-axis direction (Figure 1f). Platon calculations revealed 61.8%
potential solvent volume. The smaller angle in the parallelogram is
ca. 82.7°. The 3D open framework of 1-Eu can be
viewed as a cross linkage of two groups of parallel layers. Different
from other ditopic dicarboxylate ligands, tatab ligands are bridged
to an inorganic Eu–O chain, limiting the rotation around the
O–O-axis of carboxylate.

pillar framework with 1D rhombic channels along the c-axis direction.

To further investigate
the possible breathing effect, carefully
controlled experiments were conducted. The as-synthesized 1-Eu was placed inside desiccators for 48 h to obtain 1′-Eu. The structure of 1′-Eu can also be determined
by X-ray single-crystal diffraction. Compound 1′-Eu maintained its original macroscopic morphology and also crystallized
in the monoclinic P21/c space group. Simultaneously, desolvated 1′ was
placed in the mother liquor for two days, and the resolvated sample
was tested by XRD. Although the resolvated sample of the majority
of reported breathing MOFs showed poor crystallinity, we were able
to acquire a resolvated crystal. Compared with primary 1, the cell parameters (a = 29.3277(14) Å, b = 21.7233(18) Å, c = 15.2203(5)
Å, α = 90°, β = 103.351(4)°, γ =
90°, V = 9434.6(10) Å3) of the
resolvated crystal showed a slight change, which was probably caused
by the breathing action of solvent molecules into MOFs pores.

The overall structure of 1′-Eu is a 3D open
framework, with parallelogram channels along the c-axis direction, similar to 1-Eu. However, in contrast
to as-synthesized 1-Eu, the cell volume decreased markedly
upon removal of the guests. The main structural differences between 1-Eu and 1′-Eu are as follows: (i) The
cell parameters were changed from a = 27.609(3) Å, b = 23.570(3) Å, c = 15.2361(16) Å,
β = 104.257(3)°, and V = 9609.8(18) Å3 in as-synthesized 1-Eu to a = 32.159(3) Å, b = 16.9564(14) Å, c = 15.0477(12) Å, β = 102.061(2)°, and V = 8024.4(12) Å3 in 1′-Eu. Compared with the cell volume of as-synthesized 1-Eu, the cell volume of 1′-Eu decreased by 16.4%.
(ii) The smaller angle in the parallelogram decreased to 80.7°.
(iii) The potential solvent-accessible volume in 1′-Eu decreased from 61.8 to 52.0%. Time-dependent powder X-ray diffraction
(PXRD) patterns also confirmed the breathing effect. Mechanically,
different from breathing MOFs with linear dicarboxylate ligands, the
semirigid tripodal tatab ligand is bridged to the inorganic Eu–O
chain to limit the rotation around the O–O-axis of carboxylate.
The breathing mechanism is based on the flexible C–N–C
angles (127–133°) of amide bonds in the tatab ligand,
resulting in a change in the solvent-accessible volume in the framework.
As shown in Figure S2, PXRD patterns of
as-synthesized 1-Eu match simulated powder patterns if
the measurement was conducted immediately after taking out the as-synthesized
sample. The main peaks in PXRD patterns
will shift to a higher angle if the sample stood in air for some time
and was then measured. The PXRD patterns will not change after standing
for 3 days, indicating the formation of a stable desolvated structure.
Simultaneously, we conducted thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) measurements
in air at a heating rate of 10 °C min–1 (Figure S3). The number of solvents within 1-Eu cannot be determined from elemental analysis and TGA
measurements, as as-synthesized 1-Eu loses solvents very
quickly at room temperature. Despite the larger void indicated by
the structure, isothermal adsorption measurements did not show permanent
porosity, even though many activation conditions were created.

Luminescence
Properties
To determine whether the tatab
linker is an excellent antenna chromophore for sensitizing the lanthanide
ions, especially Eu3+and Tb3+ ions, the luminescence
excitation and emission spectra of solid 1′-Eu, 1′-Tb and free ligand were recorded at room temperature.
As mentioned before, as-synthesized Ln-tatab MOFs will desolvate and
induce a breathing effect upon standing in air, and thus the as-synthesized
crystals were allowed to stand in air for 3 days before luminescent
measurements to eliminate the possible influence of guests. The tatab
ligand displayed emission peaks of 402, 446, 467, and 517 nm under
excitation at 356 nm, which can be attributed to the π–π*
transitions (Figure S4). Upon excitation
at 381 nm, 1′-Eu displayed emission peaks of the
tatab ligand and the characteristic red emissions at 591 and 615 nm,
which can be attributed to 5D0–7FJ (J = 1, 2) transitions
of Eu3+ ions (Figure S5). Simultaneously, 1′-Tb, after excitation at 356 nm, displayed characteristic
green luminescence in the narrow emission bands at 488, 543, 583,
and 622 nm, ascribed to 5D4–7FJ (J = 6–3)
transitions of Tb3+ ions (Figure S6). Different from 1′-Eu species, no emission
of tatab was observed in 1′-Tb, indicating the
energy transfer from tatab to Tb ions. For co-doped mixed lanthanide
MOF 1′-Eu0.015Tb0.985, characteristic
emissions for both Eu3+ (614 nm) and Tb3+ (545
nm) were observed under the excitation at 342 nm (Figure S7).

The temperature-dependent photoluminescence
properties of the Ln-MOFs were investigated both in terms of intensity
and lifetime to establish their potential as luminescent thermometers.
In Figure 2a,b, the
luminescent intensity of 1′-Eu decreases gradually
with an increase in temperature from 90 to 300 K, whereas the luminescent
intensity of 1′-Tb does not show an obvious change.
It should be noted that emission of tatab did not occur for 1′-Tb in the entire temperature range measured, implying
quite efficient energy transfer from tatab to Tb3+. All
characteristic 5D4–7F6–4 (Tb3+) and 5D0–7F1–4 (Eu3+) transitions were
decreased in the doped mixed lanthanide 1′-Eu0.015Tb0.985 from 90 to 300 K (Figure 2c), with the rate of decrease
of Eu3+ (614 nm) being faster than that of Tb3+ (545 nm), especially in the range of 230–300 K. Such a decreasing
trend can be seen from the integrated intensity (Figure 2d).

Figure 2 Emission spectra of 1′-Eu (a), 1′-Tb (b), and 1′-Eu0.015Tb0.985 (c) recorded
between 90 and 300 K. Temperature dependence of integration
intensity of 5D4 → 7F5 (534–562 nm) and 5D0 → 7F2 (605–633 nm) transitions for 1′-Eu0.015Tb0.985 (d).

To further explore the relationship between the sensitivity
of
temperature, temperature and the integrated intensity ratio of Tb3+ (545 nm) to Eu3+ (614 nm) for 1′-Eu0.015Tb0.985 are plotted, which shows a
nonlinear relationship (Figure 3). For single Tb-MOF, the relative luminescence intensity
slightly decreased from 1.8 to 1.0 in the range of 90–300 K.
In contrast, co-doped MOF 1′-Eu0.015Tb0.985 showed a converse and more sensitive change trend. The emission intensity ratio of 5D4 → 7F5 (Tb, 545 nm) to 5D0 → 7F2 (Eu 614 nm) transition for 1′-Eu0.015Tb0.985 approximates to 1.2 and remains
constant in the range 90–220 K and then rapidly increased to
3.2 at the highest measured temperature of 300 K. The temperature
can be linearly related to ITb/IEu with eq 1 in the temperature range 230 to 300 K, and the correlation
coefficient is R2 = 0.996, indicating
that 1′-Eu0.015Tb0.985 is
an excellent luminescent thermometer. 1  More importantly, the temperature-dependent
luminescence color of 1′-Eu0.015Tb0.985 gradually blueshift from orange to green with an increase
in temperature from 90 to 300 K, which makes it especially easy to
use as a sensitive luminescent colorimetric thermometer for straightforward
in situ visualization of the temperature change (Figure 4). Also, the photograph of
luminescent 1′-Eu0.015Tb0.985 at different
temperatures was collected (Figure S8).
On the basis of the Commission Internationale d′ Eclairage
(CIE 1931) chromaticity diagram, the corresponding CIE coordinates
change from (0.4486, 0.4896) at 90 K to (0.3261, 0.5213) at 300 K.

To better understand the mechanism, the lifetimes of the
excited
states 5D0(Eu3+) and 5D4(Tb3+) for these luminescent MOFs at different
temperatures were monitored at 614 and 545 nm. With an increase in
temperature from 90 to 300 K, the lifetimes for 5D0 in 1′-Eu and 5D4 in 1′-Tb decreased by approximately 50 and 30%,
respectively. The lifetimes of 5D4(Tb3+) and 5D0(Eu3+) not only changed
with temperature but also changed with doping of different lanthanide
ions. As shown in Table 1, co-doped 1′-Eu0.015Tb0.985 exhibits a longer 5D4(Tb3+) lifetime
than 1′-Tb, but a shorter 5D0(Eu3+) lifetime than 1′-Eu at a given
temperature.

Conclusions
In summary, the organic ligand 4,4′,4-s-triazine-1,3,5-triyltri-p-aminobenzoic acid was selected to synthesize new three-dimensional
breathing MOFs, which contract framework through losing guest molecules.
Interestingly, we found an abnormal blueshift of luminescence color
from orange to green with increasing temperature in Eu/Tb-co-doped 1′-Eu0.015Tb0.985, quite different
from the redshift in related compounds. The breathing co-doped lanthanide
MOF 1′-Eu0.015Tb0.985 can
be applied as a high-sensitivity ratiometric thermometer in a broad
temperature from 230 to 300 K. At present, the exact reason for the
blueshift in our compound instead of a redshift in the related compounds
is not clear. However, we speculate that this interesting phenomenon
may arise from a minor change in the energy level in our compound
induced by interactions between guest molecules and the host framework. The experimental result is seen to repeat; however, the exact reason
could be linked to the appearance of more complexes of blueshift.
A comparison of their crystal and electron structures should be performed
in the future.

Experimental Section
Materials and Physical
Measurements
All reagents and
solvents were acquired from a commercial source and used as received
without further purification. The Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR)
spectra were recorded as KBr discs on a PerkinElmer Spectrum BX FT-IR
spectrometer in the range 400–4000 cm–1.
The thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) were performed using the SETARAM
LABSYS equipment at a heating rate of 10 °C/min under an air
atmosphere. Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) data were determined by
a Bruker D8 ADVANCE diffractometer for Cu Kα radiation (λ
= 1.5418 Å). Steady and temperature-dependent fluorescence spectra
were investigated on an FLS920 fluorescence spectrophotometer, equipped
with a continuous Xe-900 xenon lamp and an F900 microsecond flash
lamp as the excitation light source. Temperature control from 90 to
300 K was carried out by a Janis closed cycle refrigerator system.
Because desolvation can induce a breathing effect of 1, as-synthesized crystals were allowed to stand in air for one week
to ensure desolvation and formation of a stable structure. Inductively
coupled plasma (ICP) spectroscopy was performed on a PerkinElmer Optima
8000 DV ICP. The Eu/Tb ratio of Eu0.015Tb0.985 was determined by ICP analysis, in agreement with the original molar
ratio of Eu3+/Tb3+in the starting chemicals.

Synthesis of [Eu(tatab)]·Solvent (1-Eu) and
[Tb(tatab)]·Solvent (1-Tb)
A mixture of
Ln(NO3)3·6H2O (0.18 mmol, Ln
= Eu, Tb) and H3tatab (0.027 g, 0.06 mmol) in 6 mL of the
mixed solvent of N-methyl pyrrolidone (NMP) (3 mL)
and H2O (3 mL) were stirred for 30 min at room temperature,
and then sealed in a 15 mL Teflon-lined stainless autoclave. This
was maintained at 150 °C for 5 days. After the mixture was slowly
cooled to room temperature and filtered, yellow rodlike crystals of 1-Eu and 1-Tb were obtained in the yield ca.
50% based on H3tatab. Due to the gradual removal of guests,
the result of elemental analyses is precise and thus the IR (KBr pellet,
cm–1) for 1-Eu: 3420(s), 2927(w), 2855(w),
1672(m), 1589(m), 1529(m), 1452(m), 1387(vs), 1326(s), 1277(w), 1200(s),
1183(m), 1120(w), 855(m), 821(w), 772(w), 526(m), 480(m). For 1-Tb: 3420(s), 2921(w), 2855(w), 1639(m), 1595(m), 1551(m),
1452(m), 1397(vs), 1315(s), 1271(w), 1195(s), 1129(m), 1118(w), 860(m),
822(w), 773(w), 521(m), 482(m).

Synthesis of [Eu0.015Tb0.985(tatab)2]·Solvent (1-Eu0.015Tb0.985)
The synthesis of
the mixed-lanthanide compound 1-Eu0.015Tb0.985 was carried out following the
above procedure, except for the use of a mixture of Eu(NO3)3·6H2O and Tb(NO3)3·6H2O instead of pure Ln salts.

Synthesis of
[Ln(tatab)]·3.7H2O·2.5NMP 1′
As-synthesized 1 was placed
in desiccators for 48 h to obtain 1′, during which
a yellow crystalline rodlike structure remained. Anal. Calcd (%) for 1′-Eu: C, 53.48; H, 5.53; N, 10.25. Found: C, 53.50;
H, 5.23; N, 10.70.

Single-Crystal Structure Determination
The crystallographic
data were collected on an Agilent Technologies Gemini Eos diffractometer
at room temperature using Mo Kα radiation (λ = 0.71073
Å). The program SAINT was applied for integration of the diffraction
profiles, and absorption corrections were used based on the SAD ABS
program. All of the structures were solved by direct methods, and
were refined anisotropically by the full-matrix least-squares technique
using the Olex2 programs. All nonhydrogen atoms were refined anisotropically.
H-atoms on the ligand were placed in idealized positions and refined
isotropically with fixed thermal factors.

Initially, we attempted
to refine the structure as best as possible, but failed, despite the
presence of middle-sized cells and strong diffraction. During data
collection, the change from 9610 to 8024 Å3 in 16.5%
of the cells indicates a breathing effect of the titled compounds.
The crystal data and details of the data collection are presented
in Table S1, whereas selected bond lengths
and bond angles are presented in Tables S2 and S3.
