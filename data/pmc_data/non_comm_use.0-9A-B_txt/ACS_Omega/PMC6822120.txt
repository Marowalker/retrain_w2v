The surface modification
of nanoparticles (NPs) can enhance cellular
and intracellular targeting. A new type of polyamine-modified gold
NPs (AuNPs) are designed and synthesized, which can be selectively
absorbed onto the cell membrane. AuNPs with an average diameter of
4.0 nm were prepared and modified with polyamine (R-4C) through amidation.
In order to detect the distribution of NPs within cells by fluorescence
imaging, AuNP@MPA-R-4C was functionalized with fluorescein isothiocyanate
(FITC). The fluorescence-labled NPs AuNP@MPA-R-4C-FITC demonstrated
minimal cytotoxicity in several cell lines. Both confocal laser scanning
microscopy and transmission electron microscopy demonstrated that
AuNP@MPA-R-4C-FITC was distributed on the cell membrane. Compared
with the free organic dye, the modified AuNPs showed significantly
increased accumulation on the cell membrane after treatment for only
10 min. These results suggested that AuNP@MPA-R-4C-FITC can be used
as a bioprobe targeting the cell membrane for various biological applications.

Introduction
The cell membrane has
many important physiological functions.1,2 It stabilizes
and controls the intracellular environment by selectively
permitting the entry of certain biomolecules while excluding others.
Cell membranes facilitate this through several mechanisms, including
passive diffusion, direct uptake, endocytosis, and exocytosis.3 The cell membrane also plays an important role
in cell recognition, signal transmission, cellulose synthesis, microfibril
assembly, and others.4−8

Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) are currently one of the most widely
studied nanomaterials because of their unique optical properties,
high chemical stability, and biocompatibility.9−13 It has broad potential for application in nanoelectronics,
nanophotonics, catalysis, sensors, biomarkers, and many other areas.14−18 Notably, AuNPs have a large surface area and can be used as a carrier
for fluorescent dyes.19,20 NPs have often been used in fluorescence
immunoassay to improve the detection sensitivity.21 As fluorescent probes, AuNPs can control cell function,
regulate gene expression, and detect analytes in the cells.22−24 Therefore, improving functionalized AuNPs has become an area of
interest in the development of fluorescent probes. Amino acids are
the basic compositional unit of proteins, and are also essential nutrients
in animal diets.25,26 Amino acid derivatives demonstrate
significant biological function and can be designed to interact with
intracellular targets.27,28 Despite of the many advances
in the development of fluorescent probes, a fundamental issue remaining
to be addressed is the cytotoxicity and target specificity.

In this context, AuNPs functionalized with amino acid derivatives
for biological targeting properties were synthesized (Scheme 1a,b). The amino acids included l-tryptophan (l-Trp), l-lysine (l-Lys), l-cysteine (l-Cys), and l-glutamic
(l-Glu). The AuNPs were first modified with 3-mercaptopropionic
acid (MPA) to form a self-assembled monolayer and were subsequently
conjugated with R-4C through the formation of amide bonds between
the terminal amines on R-4C and the terminal carboxylic acid on the
particles. FITC is a versatile agent used for cell imaging by confocal
microscopy. Although AuNPs are known to be a very efficient fluorescence
quencher,29 the attachment of FITC through
the R-4C spacer did show significant emission intensity. In order
to detect the distribution of NPs in cells by fluorescence imaging,
AuNP@MPA-R-4C was functionalized with FITC by amidation (Scheme 1c). MTT assay demonstrated
that these modified AuNPs did not cause cytotoxicity in several kinds
of cells. Both confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) and transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) demonstrated that the modified AuNPs were
mainly distributed on the cell membrane. The modified AuNPs can enter
the cell membrane after incubating for just 10 min and can persist
for at least 6 h on the cell membrane. These results suggest that
surface modification can enhance the stability and improve the biocompatibility
of AuNPs. Moreover, these modified AuNPs can selectively enter the
cell membrane to facilitate the targeting of a fluorescent probe.

Results and Discussion
Preparation
and Characterization of AuNPs
The citrate-stabilized
AuNP@MPA was prepared by sodium borohydride reduction of tetrachloroauric(III)
acid solution in the presence of sodium citrate. The morphology of
AuNP@MPA was characterized by TEM (Figure S1a, Supporting Information). The results showed that these NPs
were uniformly dispersed with a spherical shape, and had an average
diameter of 4.5 nm. AuNP@MPA-R-4C-FITC was then prepared (Scheme 1). Amino acids can
be divided into several groups based on its polarity, including nonpolar,
polar without charge, polar with positive charge, and polar with negative
charge.30 Thus, we selected representative
amino acids from each group, including l-Trp, l-Cys, l-Lys, and l-Glu acid. First, AuNP@MPA was conjugated
with R-4C through amidation between the terminal amines on R-4C and
the terminal carboxylic acid groups on the particles. The biocompatible
R-4C not only serves as a coating to increase protein adsorption and
specific macrophage uptake, but also serves as a linking agent providing
terminal functional groups for the conjugation of ligands, such as
FITC and BODIPY. In order to detect the distribution of AuNPs in cells
by fluorescence imaging, AuNP@MPA-R-4C was further functionalized
with FITC through amidation.31 AuNPs were
characterized by TEM and dynamic light scattering (DLS) for particle
size and size distribution. TEM results showed that the size distribution
of AuNP@MPA-R-4C-FITC was similar to that of the AuNP@MPA particles
and had an average diameter of 6.0, 6.2, 5.7, and 5.7 nm, respectively
(Figure S1, Supporting Information). Namely,
the size increased by 1–2 nm for AuNPs because of the coating
with polymer R-4C-FITC. Moreover, the corresponding hydrodynamic-diameter
distributions of the AuNPs in water measured by DLS are shown in Figure
S2 in Supporting Information, giving average
hydrodynamic diameters of 5.0, 6.7, 9.1, 7.1, and 7.2 nm, respectively.
Moreover, DLS analysis indicated that there were some aggregations
of AuNPs. These results are also in agreement with TEM observation.
These data indicated that the morphology of AuNPs was unaffected by
the added polymer R-4C-FITC. AuNP@MPA-R-4C-FITC NPs demonstrated little
aggregation, probably because of the interactions between the functional
groups on the surface of the NPs.32

The representative UV–vis absorption spectra of AuNP@MPA and
AuNP@MPA-Lys-4C-FITC NPs (Figure S3, Supporting Information) showed that the UV–vis absorption spectra
of AuNP@MPA-Lys-4C-FITC exhibited a new absorption band at 530 nm
compared with that of AuNP@MPA, which was absorbed at 343 nm. There
was no significant change in the position or the width of absorbance
bands from AuNP@MPA, suggesting that Lys-4C-FITC derivatives were
successfully incorporated into AuNP@MPA NPs.

The AuNPs were
further characterized by fluorescence spectroscopy.
The emission spectra of AuNP@MPA and AuNP@MPA-R-4C-FITC (Figures S4
and Figure S5, Supporting Information)
showed that the fluorescence intensity at 561 nm was increased in
AuNP@MPA-Trp-4C or AuNP@MPA-Lys-4C; however, the fluorescence intensity
at 516 nm decreased upon FITC conjugation. This change was attributed
to the fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) with FITC as
the donor and AuNP@MPA-Trp-4C or AuNP@MPA-Lys-4C as the acceptor.
This is consistent with the overlap between the absorption spectra
of the later with the fluorescence spectrum of the former. FRET is
possible only when the two species are in close physical proximity,
typically within nanometers of each other. Therefore, the observation
of FRET in this case further indicates complex formation between these
two oppositely charged species.

Cell Cytotoxicity
To explore the cell toxicity of AuNPs,
HepG2, QSG-7701, and MCF-7 cells were treated with AuNPs at different
concentrations for 48 h according to the standard methylthiazole tetrazolium
(MTT) assay. The cell viabilities of these AuNPs are shown in Figure 1. Obviously, AuNP@MPA-R-4C-FITC
showed lower toxicity in the three kinds of cells in our study. These
results suggested that AuNP@MPA-R-4C-FITC caused less damage to normal
cells and cancer cells. Especially, the cytotoxicity of AuNP@MPA-Lys-4C-FITC
with positive charge was lower than other AuNPs. The surface charge
of the lysine residue-modified APs is highly positive, which allows
interaction with a negatively charged cell surface. Maybe, the lysine
residue with more positive charge can significantly affect the minimal
cytotoxicity.33

Figure 1 Cell viability of Au@MPA-Trp-4C-FITC,
Au@MPA-Lys-4C-FITC, Au@MPA-Cys-4C-FITC,
and Au@MPA-Glu-4C-FITC with (a) HepG2 cells, (b) MCF-7 cells, and
(c) QSG-7701 cells. Cells were incubated with samples at different
concentrations at 37 °C for 48 h.

Intracellular Uptake of AuNPs
Because AuNP@MPA-Lys-4C-FITC
demonstrated good optical properties and minimal cytotoxicity, its
specific binding to the surface of living cells was investigated in
HepG2 cells. AuNP@MPA-R-4C-FITC is sufficiently fluorescent and its
intracellular behavior is visible by CLSM. AuNP@MPA-Lys-4C-FITC nanoconjugates
showed considerably stable fluorescence when excited at 488 nm. To
study the intracellular uptake of AuNPs, HepG2, MCF-7, and QSG-7701
cells were incubated with AuNP@MPA-Lys-4C-FITC for 10 min and the
cellular fluorescence signal was imaged using CLSM. Figure 2 shows the fluorescence images
of HepG2, MCF-7, and QSG-7701 cells incubated with AuNP@MPA-Lys-4C-FITC
at a concentration of 500 μg/mL. We observed that AuNP@MPA-Lys-4C-FITC
was uptaken by cells. These results demonstrated that AuNP@MPA-R-4C-FITC
can permeate the cell membrane and enter the cells.

Figure 2 Confocal images of (a)
HepG2, (b) QSG-7701, and (c) MCF-7 cells
treated with AuNP@MPA-Lys-4C-FITC for 10 min at 37 °C.

Moreover, we studied the time-dependence and concentration-dependence
of the cellular uptake of AuNP@MPA-R-4C-FITC. Figure 3 shows the fluorescence images of HepG2 with
AuNP@MPA-Lys-4C-FITC at different concentrations. We found that the
fluorescence intensity increased with increasing concentration. Also Figure 4 shows the fluorescence
images of HepG2 treated with AuNP@MPA-Lys-4C-FITC for different incubation
times. We can observe that the fluorescence intensity decreased as
the incubation time increased. AuNP@MPA-Lys-4C-FITC was found to enter
the cell quickly within 10 min (Figure 4a). However, after 6 h incubation, the signal decreased
significantly in the green channel (Figure 4e). Thus, the fluorescence intensity of AuNP@MPA-R-4C-FITC-treated
cells varied with different sample concentrations and incubation times.
The fluorescence of the NPs faded over time mainly because of the
exocytosis of AuNPs into cells. Some NPs disintegrated in the endolysosomal
compartments of HepG2 cells, followed by slow metabolism.34,35

Selective Localization of the AuNPs in Vitro
The accumulation
of these AuNPs within subcellular compartments was of particular importance.
To confirm the selective localization of the AuNPs in vitro, HepG2
cells were incubated with AuNP@MPA-Lys-4C-FITC. After incubation for
10 min, the cells were washed. In vitro intracellular colocalization
of AuNP@MPA-Lys-4C-FITC with WGA–Alexa Flour 594 (cytomembrane
dye) in HepG2 cells was investigated using CLSM. As shown in Figure 5, AuNP@MPA-Lys-4C-FITC
had complete colocalization with cytomembrane dye in HepG2 cells.
In order to confirm that the fluorescent dye did not affect the accumulation
of NPs within the cell membrane, another dye BODIPY was combined with
AuNP@MPA-R-4C. As shown in Figure 6, AuNP@MPA-Lys-4C-BODIPY also had complete colocalization
with cytomembrane dye in HepG2 cells. Evaluation of the staining patterns
and colocalization revealed that the AuNPs can remain intact after
uptake and can be predominantly confined within the cytomembrane.

AuNP@MPA-Lys-4C-FITC (green) for 10 min at 37 °C. Cells were
stained with Hoechst (blue) for the nucleus, WGA–Alexa Flour
594 for cytomembrane (red).

Figure 6 Confocal
images of HepG2 cells treated with AuNP@MPA-Lys-4C-BODIPY
(500 μg/mL) for 10 min at 37 °C.

In contrast, HepG2 cells treated with free FITC under the same
conditions exhibited a high level of fluorescence in cell nucleus
(Figure S6, Supporting Information). Importantly,
the fluorescence of the modified AuNPs can be observed only in the
cell membrane areas, whereas FITC fluorescence was detected in the
nucleus, indicating that the modified AuNPs easily penetrated into
the cell membrane instead of the nucleus. The efficient internalization
of the AuNPs demonstrated that Lys-4C facilitated the specific intracellular
uptake, which was driven mainly by endocytosis.36 Accumulation of AuNPs within the cytomembrane suggested
that the uptake was dominant. This evidence indicated that nearly
all of the endocytosed AuNPs were transported inside the cytomembrane
without being released into the cytoplasm or nucleus.

Furthermore,
the localization of modified AuNPs in HepG2 cells
was observed by TEM. As shown in Figure 7, the AuNP@MPA NPs were scattered in the
cytoplasm; however, the modified AuNPs were not scattered in the cytoplasm,
but clustered and attached to the cytomembrane. This was likely because
of electrostatic interactions between the positively charged AuNPs
and the negatively charged membranes. All these results confirm that
AuNPs can be leveraged as a platform for cytomembrane targeted probes
in bioimaging. The low toxicity of AuNPs toward cells further confirms
that AuNPs are a promising fluorescent probe for in vitro imaging
of cellular processes.37

with AuNP@MPA (500 μg/mL), and (c,d) treated with AuNP@MPA-Lys-4C-FITC
(500 μg/mL) for 10 min.

Conclusions
In conclusion, we present the modification of
4 nm AuNPs using
MPA, R-4C, FITC, and BODIPY. The multiple amine groups on the particle
surface allow conjugation onto the particles with a variety of molecules
through the formation of amide bonds under mild conditions. This property
makes these particles ideal candidates for the enhancement of targeting.
Both CLSM and TEM demonstrate that AuNP@MPA-Lys-4C-FITC NPs are distributed
on the cell membrane. Thus, AuNP@MPA-R-4C-FITC can be used as a bioprobe
swallowed by the cell membrane for studying biological processes.

Cell Culture
HepG2 (human hepatocellular liver carcinoma),
QSG-7701 (human normal liver), and MCF-7 (human breast cancer) cells
were maintained in RMPI-1640 medium supplemented with heat-inactivated
FBS (10% v/v) and 1% (v/v) penicillin–streptomycin (100 U mL–1 penicillin G and 100 mg mL–1 streptomycin)
at 37 °C under 5% CO2. These cells were allowed to
grow in a monolayer in a tissue culture flask.

Cell Viability Assays
The cell viability of complexes
was evaluated in HepG2, QSG-7701, and MCF-7 cells. Briefly, cells
were seeded into 96-well plates at 5 × 104 cells per
well. After 12 h, various concentrations (0.05, 0.10, 0.20, 0.50,
and 1.00 mg/mL) of samples were subsequently added and incubated for
48 h (the concentration of original AuNPs was 0.001, 0.005, 0.01,
0.02, and 0.05 mg/mL). Then 20 μL 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide (MTT) (2.5 mg/mL) was added to each well. After 4 h incubation,
the medium was then removed and 100 mL DMSO was added to the plates
to dissolve the formazan products. The absorbance of the solution
containing the extracts was read at 570 nm on a Tecan Infinite F200
M200 multimode plate reader. The inhibition rate was calculated from
the plotted results using untreated cells as 100%.

Cellular Uptake
of Targeted AuNP@MPA-R-4C-X
Cells seeded
in a 6-well tissue culture plate (Corning) were incubated with AuNP@MPA-R-4C-FITC
or AuNP@MPA-R-4C-BODIPY with a different concentration and different
incubation time at 37 °C. After incubation for indicated time
points, the cells were thoroughly washed with phosphate-buffered saline
buffer at pH 7.4, and incubated with Hoechst 33342 (10 mg/mL) or WGA,
Alexa Flour 594 (5 μg/mL) for 30 min at 37 °C, and then
viewed with a confocal microscope (Leica-SP8). The nucleus and cell
membrane were obtained by counting in eight randomly chosen fields
per dish per experimental group from three separate experiments. Cell
nuclei stained with Hoechst 33342 were observed under an emission
at 405 nm and analyzed from 430 to 480 nm. In addition the membrane
stained with AuNP@MPA-R-4C-BODIPY was observed under an emission at
590 nm and analyzed from 615 to 635 nm. AuNP@MPA-R-4C-FITC was excited
at 488 nm with an Ar laser. A band pass from 500 to 560 nm was used
for observation.

TEM Analysis
Cells incubated with
samples were first
fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde (in 0.1 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.0).
The cells were fixed with 1% perosmic oxide for 2 h at 4 °C.
After being washed in water, the cells were dehydrated in a series
of alcohol, embedded, and sliced with the thickness between 50 and
70 nm. TEM analysis was performed on a JEM-1230EX transmission electron
microscope operating at 80 kV in bright field mode.
