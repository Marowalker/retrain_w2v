The electrochemical
systems of both grafted catechol as a pH-responsive electrophore and
immobilized cytochrome c as a model redox protein
are detected by cyclic voltammetry at an optimized lipid deposit-modified
glassy carbon electrode. The catechol covalent grafting is successfully
performed by the one-pot/three-step electrochemical reduction of 3,4-dihydroxybenzenediazonium
salts generated in situ from 4-nitrocatechol. The resulting glassy carbon
electrode electrochemically modified by grafted catechol species is
evaluated as an efficient electrochemical pH sensor. The optimized
molar ratio for the lipid deposit, promoting cytochrome c electrochemical activity in solution onto glassy carbon electrode,
is reached for the lipid mixture composed of 75% 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine and 25% cardiolipin. Cytochrome c immobilization into the optimized supported lipid deposit
is efficiently achieved by cyclic voltammetry (10 cycles) recorded
at the modified glassy carbon electrode in a cytochrome c solution. The pH-dependent redox response of the grafted catechol
and that of the immobilized cytochrome c are finally
detected at the same lipid-modified glassy carbon electrode without
alteration of their structure and electrochemical properties in the
pH range 5–9.

Introduction
Electroactive
bacteria are living microorganisms that are able to directly connect
their respiratory metabolism to their extracellular environment by
transferring electrons across biological membranes to or from solids
like metal oxides or electrodes.1−3 These bacteria are organized at
conducting surfaces as biofilms and can indeed shuttle electrons via
periplasmic and membrane proteins to/from electrodes.3,4 Hence, electroactive bacteria represent living, stable, self-replicating,
and low-cost electrode catalysts. This unique property leads to potential
“green” biotechnology applications, such as microbial
fuel cells, microbial electrosynthesis cells, wastewater treatment,
desalination, and biosensors.1,2,4,5 To permit the advent of these
promising microbial electrochemical technologies, it is crucial to
progress toward the fundamental knowledge of these electroactive biofilms.
In particular, it is important to understand the role and function
of membrane proteins in electroactive bacteria. Indeed, little is
known on the coupling of extracellular electron and proton transfers
in electroactive bacteria and these phenomena are key factors for
optimizing and designing relevant applications.

Figure 1 Conceptual scheme of
the target electrochemical platform: pH-responsive electrophores (here
quinones) grafted on electrodes supporting lipid deposits allow the
study of the charge transfer properties of membrane-associated proteins
(electron or proton transfer or both). Note that the selected proteins
in this scheme are for an illustrative purpose only.

Electroactive microorganisms such as Gram-negative Geobacter sulfurreducens directly connect and transfer
electrons to anodes via outer-membrane c-type cytochrome
redox proteins as ultimate redox relays.3,6 In the absence
of an organic substrate like acetate, at least four redox proteins
may be detected electrochemically in the biofilm, whereas in the presence
of an organic substrate, extracellular electron release from bacterial
catabolism is easily followed by recording a catalytic anodic current.7 The anolyte then becomes more acidic, consistent
with the oxidation of the organic substrate to carbon dioxide concomitantly
with proton release. Acidification of the anolyte, of the biofilm,
and/or of the biofilm/electrode interface compromises the performance
and viability of the catalytic biofilms.8−10 In fact, the extracellular
electron transfer may be coupled to proton transfer in outer-membrane c-type cytochromes or, alternatively, nonredox proton transport
proteins may be responsible for the acidification of the anolyte.
Although extracellular electron and proton transfers are known to
occur in electroactive bacteria,9,11,12 the fundamental understanding of these processes is still in its
infancy and precludes the optimization of microbial electrochemical
technologies.

The overall objective of our research is to develop
an efficient and versatile electrochemical platform for probing electroactive
bacteria membrane proteins incorporated in artificial lipid deposits
supported on modified carbon electrode. In a first approach, the electrodes
are modified with pH-responsive electrophores such as quinone units
and then covered by lipid layers or deposits, creating an artificial
supported lipid membrane in which membrane proteins are incorporated
and electrochemically probed (Figure 1). Indeed, the intrinsic electroactivity of the protein
(if any) can be probed directly with the lipid-modified electrode
and possible proton transport occurring across the lipid layer by
the membrane protein can in principle be detected with the grafted
pH-responsive redox probe (Figure 1).13,14 The first experimental challenge
of this work is to immobilize and to analyze the electrochemical activity
of the pH-responsive redox probe and that of the membrane protein
at the same electrode without alteration of their native and electrochemical
properties.15

Here, a proof of concept
of the electrochemical platform is presented using surface-grafted
catechol moieties as pH-responsive electrophores and cytochrome c as the model membrane-associated redox protein. Cytochrome c is immobilized into the supported lipid deposit at the
catechol-modified glassy carbon electrode surface. We focus on the
detection of both the pH-dependent electrophore and the redox protein
reversible redox systems at glassy carbon successively modified by
covalent catechol grafting, then by an optimized lipid deposit, and
finally by immobilization of cytochrome c. First,
the grafting of catechol onto the glassy carbon electrode is performed
by a one-pot/three-step electrochemical procedure that consists of
the cathodic reduction of 4-nitrocatechol in acidic conditions in
the presence of sodium nitrite. The electrode functionalization and
the properties of the grafted catechol moieties are evaluated by cyclic
voltammetry in phosphate buffer aqueous solution at different pH.
Then, optimization of the lipid deposit promoting cytochrome c electrochemical activity at glassy carbon leads to a 75%
1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC) and
25% cardiolipin (CL) ratio. Cytochrome c immobilization
is achieved by cyclic voltammetry of either a lipid-modified glassy
carbon electrode or a catechol/lipid-modified glassy carbon electrode,
and the electrochemical properties of the modified electrodes are
studied by cyclic voltammetry in phosphate buffer aqueous electrolyte
at various pH values.

Results and Discussion
Catechol Grafted onto Glassy
Carbon Electrode
In this section, the grafting of pH-responsive
catechol moieties and the electrochemical properties of the modified
carbon electrodes are discussed. First, a bare glassy carbon electrode
was modified by electrochemical reduction of aryldiazonium salts in
situ generated from reduction of the nitro precursor to the arylamine
(Figure 2). Then, the
catechol-modified glassy carbon electrode was studied by cyclic voltammetry
in phosphate buffer aqueous solution at different pH values (Figure 3).

pH 4.9 (orange line) under inert atmosphere (Ar). Inset: pH dependence
of the apparent normal potential of the grafted catechol with the
corresponding linear regression analysis: y = −59.8x + 605, R2 = 0.9994.

The covalent electrografting is
a powerful method to functionalize a wide range of electrode materials’
surfaces for many applications.16 Especially,
the reductive electrografting of aryldiazonium cations is very efficient
for surface modification because of its simplicity, versatility, and
robustness.16−18 Here, catechol species were grafted on glassy carbon
electrode following a surface derivatization strategy initially reported
by Cougnon et al. and based on the one-pot/three-step electrochemical
reduction of aryldiazonium cations in situ generated from the nitro
precursor (Figure 2).19,20 For our work, the main advantage to use
this one-pot/three-step procedure is to limit the surface coverage
(to less than a monolayer equivalent)20 to retain fast electron transfer kinetics between the redox protein
and the modified electrode. Indeed, this procedure allows to produce
a source of arylamine “on demand” and only in the vicinity
of the working electrode surface.19,20 This grafting
method is based on the cathodic reduction of 4-nitrocatechol to the
corresponding amino derivative in the presence of sodium nitrite in
acidic aqueous solution (0.1 M HCl). On the first cyclic voltammogram
(Figure 2), the broad
reduction wave is divided into two peaks located at −0.5 and
−0.7 V. The first reduction process at Epc = −0.5 V is assigned to the reduction of the 4-nitrocatechol
to 4-aminocatechol, whereas the reduction at Epc = −0.7 V is tentatively assigned to species originating
from the reaction of grafted catechol moieties with nucleophilic species
such as amine (Figures S1 and 2).20,21 In addition, the presence of
only one reduction peak in the second cyclic voltammogram at Epc = −0.6 V is consistent with the presence
of a first grafted catechol “layer” (Figure 2). The current intensity of
the reduction peak is also lower on the second cycle, suggesting a
partial passivation of the electrode surface consistent with glassy
carbon functionalization.20 The aryldiazonium
reduction peak is expected at ca. +0.2 V.20 However, since the diazotization of the arylamine is fast,22 the aryldiazonium is generated at an electrode
potential where it is immediately reduced. Hence, the electrochemical
response associated to the reduction of the in situ generated aryldiazonium
cannot be detected on the cyclic voltammogram. In this electrochemical
reaction mechanism, 4-aminocatechol is electrogenerated at the electrode
from 4-nitrocatechol and immediately converted into 3,4-dihydroxybenzenediazonium,
which is then reduced at the electrode in a subsequent step, leading
to the surface covalent derivatization (Figure 2).

Catechol grafting onto glassy carbon
was confirmed by sonicating the modified electrode for 2 min in ultrapure
water to desorb any material not covalently attached to its surface,
followed by the electrochemical detection of the grafted catechol
at different pH values (Figure 3). All apparent normal potentials of redox species immobilized
onto glassy carbon electrodes and discussed in the manuscript are
reported in Table 1. In Figure 3, a pH-dependent
reversible redox system is detected (Table 1) and ascribed to the grafted quinone/hydroquinone
redox couple. Figure S2 shows the cyclic
voltammograms recorded at the glassy carbon electrode before and after
surface modification, which confirms the effectiveness of the grafting
procedure. In addition, the linear relationship between the oxidative
peak currents and the scan rate (Figure S3) indicates that the catechol groups are confined to the electrode
surface.19,20,23 The surface
coverage of the grafted catechol species onto the modified glassy
carbon calculated from integration of the faradaic current on the
cyclic voltammograms and based on the geometrical area of the electrode
(0.0707 cm2) is (1.5 ± 0.5) × 10–10 mol cm–2. This corresponds to a submonolayer modification
and is consistent with the results reported previously.20 Indeed, the grafting of catechol units through
the one-pot/three-step electrochemical reduction procedure from the
nitro precursor allows a fine control of the grafting yield. In addition,
and as expected for this pH-responsive electrophore, the apparent
normal potential of the grafted catechol is linearly proportional
to the pH with a slope of 60 mV per pH unit over a pH range from 5
to 9 in the phosphate buffer electrolyte used here (Figure 3, inset). These results show
that the glassy carbon electrode is electrochemically modified by
grafted catechol species from a 4-nitrocatechol precursor and the
resulting modified electrode is an efficient electrochemical pH sensor.

Cytochrome c Electroactivity in Solution and Immobilized onto Lipid-Modified
Glassy Carbon Electrode
In this section, we discuss the electrochemical
study and immobilization of cytochrome c at a glassy
carbon electrode modified by an optimized supported lipid mixture
deposit. The optimum lipid deposit ratio of 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC) and cardiolipin (CL) was first determined
by cyclic voltammetry recorded at the different lipid-modified glassy
carbon electrodes in a cytochrome c solution (Figure 4). In a second step,
the immobilization of cytochrome c onto the glassy
carbon electrode modified by the optimized lipid film was performed
by recurrent cyclic voltammetry (10 cycles) and then the resulting
modified electrode was transferred to a protein-free phosphate buffer
aqueous electrolyte for studying the immobilized protein electroactivity
(Figure 5).

(10th cycle shown) recorded at 20 mV s–1 on glassy
carbon electrode before (black) and after modification with a lipid
deposit comprising 100% DOPC (blue), 100% CL (pink), 75% DOPC/25%
CL (orange), 50% DOPC/50% CL (gray), and 25% DOPC/75% CL (green) in
a 0.05 mM cytochrome c solution in 10 mM phosphate
buffer aqueous electrolyte at pH 7.2 under inert atmosphere (Ar).

recorded at 20 mV s–1 in 10 mM protein-free phosphate
buffer aqueous electrolyte at pH 7.2 under Ar with a glassy carbon
electrode modified by a 75% DOPC/25% CL lipid deposit and previously
cycled in a cytochrome c solution for protein immobilization.

In a previous work, we have investigated
the effect of pure cardiolipin (CL) deposit to promote the electrochemical
activity of cytochrome c at a glassy carbon electrode
since it is known that this lipid is crucial for the physiological
function of this redox protein.24 Here,
the dilution of cardiolipin within a 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC) matrix has been optimized. DOPC
is a phospholipid commonly used in supported lipid bilayers but inefficient
to promote the cytochrome c electroactivity (vide
infra). To optimize the lipids mixture deposited on glassy carbon
electrode surface, the best ratio of DOPC/CL for promoting the cytochrome c electroactivity was determined by cyclic voltammetry with
different lipid deposits supported on glassy carbon electrode in a
cytochrome c aqueous solution (Figure 4). Each lipid deposit was carried out by
dipping for a few seconds the electrode in a 3.4 mM lipid solution
in ethanol with different molar ratios of DOPC and CL and by subsequently
letting the electrode dry upside down under air. As expected, the
cyclic voltammogram recorded at the bare glassy carbon electrode in
the cytochrome c solution does not display the protein
redox signal because of denaturation or unfavorable orientation.25,26 The same result is also observed in the cyclic voltammogram recorded
at the 100% DOPC lipid deposit-modified glassy carbon electrode although
with a lower capacitive current in comparison to the unmodified electrode.
This observation confirms that cardiolipin and its specific interaction
with cytochrome c is an essential parameter for promoting
the protein electrochemical activity.24 Indeed, a reversible redox system at +0.010 V (ΔEp = 47 ± 8 mV at 20 mV s–1) corresponding
to the typical electrochemical response of cytochrome c in solution is observed in the cyclic voltammograms recorded at
glassy carbon electrodes modified by a lipid deposit containing cardiolipin.25,27−29 One can also note a slight variation of the apparent
normal potential of cytochrome c (from −0.002
to +0.013 V, Table S1) depending on the
cardiolipin fraction in the lipid deposit on the electrodes. In fact,
cardiolipin interaction with cytochrome c in systems
that do not mimic the native negative curvature and length scale of
the inner mitochondrial membrane relies on electrostatic interactions
involving lysines and histidines in the so called A- and L-sites.30 This is likely the case at the present modified
electrodes. A-site lysines are also involved in the alkaline transition
and play an important role in the stabilization of the native heme
axial coordination in the physiological pH range.31 Changes in the population fraction of cytochrome c destabilized upon cardiolipin binding for the different
lipid ratios may be at the core of the slight variation of the cytochrome c voltammetric signal with lipid composition. Furthermore,
the highest current intensity of the protein redox signal is reached
for the glassy carbon electrode modified by a 75% DOPC 25% CL lipid
deposit. Hence, for promoting cytochrome c electroactivity
by a supported lipid deposit, the optimized lipid molar ratio of 75%
DOPC/25% CL is used for all further experiments.

A simple and
efficient strategy to immobilize cytochrome c on
the lipid-modified electrode consists in performing consecutive cyclic
voltammetry (here 10 cycles were performed) in a cytochrome c solution until a steady-state current is reached (Figures 5A and S4) and then to transfer the modified electrode
into a protein-free phosphate buffer where the electroactivity of
the immobilized protein can be studied (Figure 5B).24,25,27Figure 5A shows the
increase of the cytochrome c redox peak current intensity
during continuous cyclic voltammetry in a cytochrome c solution at a glassy carbon electrode modified by a 75% DOPC/25%
CL lipid deposit. The redox peak current intensity increases gradually
until a steady-state current is reached at the 10th cycle (Figure S4). This result suggests that the lipid-modified
glassy carbon electrode is saturated with electroactive surface-confined
cytochrome c captured from solution thanks to the
specific interaction between this redox protein and cardiolipin contained
in the supported lipid deposit.24,25,27

In Figure 5B, the cyclic voltammogram recorded in a protein-free aqueous electrolyte
on 75% DOPC/25% CL lipid deposit-modified glassy carbon electrode
and previously cycled in cytochrome c solution displays
a redox system at +0.005 V and is assigned to immobilized cytochrome c. The protein apparent potential (+0.005 V) is only slighty
shifted compared to that in solution (+0.013 V), indicating that cytochrome c immobilized in the lipid film is not denaturated.24,27,32 The electrochemical signal of
the immobilized protein corresponds to an electrochemically quasi-reversible
electron transfer reaction since the peak-to-peak potential separation
is ΔEp = 90 ± 5 mV at 20 mV
s–1.33−35 The surface coverage of the immobilized electroactive
cytochrome c estimated from faradaic charge integration
of the cyclic voltammogram is ca. (1.7 ± 0.5) × 10–10 mol cm–2. This value is at least 10 times higher
than that expected for cytochrome c immobilization
onto a supported lipid deposit,24,25,27 because here the modified electrode is directly transferred from
the cytochrome c solution to the protein-free buffer
aqueous electrolyte after a simple gentle wash in phosphate buffer.35 Indeed, the fraction of the immobilized protein
that is only loosely adsorbed at the modified electrode quickly desorbs
during consecutive cyclic voltammograms (Figure S5). The redox potential of immobilized cytochrome c is not dependent on the pH of the solution in the range
of 5–9 (Figure S5).36,37 These results show that cytochrome c immobilization
is easily and efficiently carried out by cyclic voltammetry at an
optimized DOPC/CL lipid deposit-modified glassy carbon electrode in
a cytochrome c solution and the electrochemical properties
of the redox protein are kept intact in these conditions.

Grafted Catechol,
Optimized Lipid Deposit, and Immobilized Cytochrome c onto Glassy Carbon Electrode
In this section, we report
the electrochemical properties of a glassy carbon electrode successively
modified by catechol following the one-pot/three-step electrochemical
reduction grafting procedure, then by the optimized 75% DOPC/25% CL
lipid deposit (solvent evaporation), and finally by the immobilization
of cytochrome c through cyclic voltammetry in a solution
of the redox protein (Figure S6). The catechol/lipid
deposit/cytochrome c-modified glassy carbon electrode
was transferred and studied by cyclic voltammetry in a phosphate buffer
aqueous electrolyte at different pH values (Figure 6).

Figure 6 (A) Cyclic voltammograms (third cycle shown)
at 20 mV s–1 at a glassy carbon electrode modified
by catechol/lipid deposit/cytochrome c in 10 mM phosphate
buffer aqueous electrolyte successively recorded at pH 7 (solid line),
pH 6 (dotted line), pH 8.2 (dashed line), pH 9.1 (not shown), and
pH 5.5 (not shown) under inert atmosphere (Ar) (see Figure S7 for a plot of catechol redox potential vs all five
pH values). (B) Faradaic signal of interest obtained by subtracting
the capacitive current from the raw cyclic voltammograms.

The cyclic voltammograms successively recorded
at the catechol/lipid deposit/cytochrome c-modified
glassy carbon electrode in phosphate buffer aqueous electrolyte at
various pH values (pH 7, 6, and 8.2 in the chronological order of
measurements) are presented in Figure 6A. Figure 6B shows the faradaic contribution38 in the cyclic voltammograms of Figure 6A obtained by capacitive current subtraction
using the QSoas software.39 The cyclic
voltammograms clearly show two reversible redox systems located at
+0.232 V (ΔEp = 50 ± 3 mV at
20 mV s–1) and at +0.012 V (ΔEp = 43 ± 2 mV at 20 mV s–1) in
phosphate buffer aqueous electrolyte at pH 7, corresponding to the
grafted catechol and immobilized cytochrome c electrochemical
signals, respectively. In addition, the presence of the redox protein
in the methanol/ethanol/water washing solution of modified electrodes
has been confirmed by UV–visible spectroscopy measurements
(Figure S8). Electrochemical impedance
spectroscopy measurements at each modification step of the glassy
carbon electrode (Figure S9) do not evidence
any significant changes after the initial catechol grafting, indicating
that the subsequent lipid/protein deposit still contains defects and
remains permeable. As previously observed for the immobilized redox
protein onto the lipid-modified glassy carbon electrode (Figure S5), the electrochemical response of cytochrome c presented in Figure 6 is independent of the pH in the range studied (pH
5–9). A decreasing of the redox peaks’ current intensity
is also observed upon consecutive cyclic voltammograms at different
pH values, indicating a partial desorption of the protein during cyclic
voltammetry. In contrast, the redox signal of grafted catechol shows
a better stability because of the robustness of the covalent bond
with the electrode surface. Importantly, after the lipid/protein adduct
onto the electrode, the grafted catechol kept its dependence of pH-responsive
properties with a redox potential linearly proportional to the pH
(Table 1 and Figure S7) and a slope of 42 mV per pH unit in
the phosphate buffer electrolyte used here. This work demonstrates
that grafted catechol as pH-responsive electrophore and immobilized
cytochrome c as model redox protein can be detected
by cyclic voltammetry at a catechol/lipid deposit/redox protein-modified
glassy carbon electrode, while keeping intact their electrochemical
properties without alteration of their native structure.

Conclusions
In summary, the electrochemical detection of both grafted catechol
and immobilized cytochrome c onto lipid deposit-modified
glassy carbon electrode has been achieved at the same electrode. First,
a glassy carbon electrode has been functionalized by a catechol covalent
grafting procedure following the one-pot/three-step electrochemical
reduction of 3,4-dihydroxybenzenediazonium salts in situ generated
from 4-nitrocatechol. Then, an optimized lipid film composed of 75%
1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC) and
25% cardiolipin (CL) has been deposited by solvent evaporation on
the catechol-modified glassy carbon electrode surface for promoting
the cytochrome c electrochemical activity. The cytochrome c immobilization onto the catechol/lipid deposit-modified
electrode has been achieved following a simple and efficient strategy
consisting of recurrent cyclic voltammetry in a cytochrome c solution until a steady-state current is reached. The
resulting catechol/lipid deposit/cytochrome c-modified
glassy carbon electrode has been finally transferred into a protein-free
phosphate buffer where its electrochemical behavior has been studied
by cyclic voltammetry. The electrochemical detection of both grafted
catechol and immobilized cytochrome c reversible
redox systems has been achieved while maintaining intact their native
electrochemical properties, namely, the pH-dependent reversible system
of the grafted quinone/catechol redox couple and the pH-independent
electroactivity of the redox protein (in the pH range studied). This
work is a first proof of concept for an electrochemical platform aimed
at probing charge transfer properties of membrane-associated proteins.
The pH range (ca. pH 5–9) studied here is physiologically relevant
for a wide range of proteins, and the associated potential shift of
the grafted catechol (namely, 293–137 mV vs Ag/AgCl at pH 5.5
and 9.1, respectively) does not overlap with any of the known outer-membrane c-type cytochromes of electroactive bacteria.40 Current work in our laboratory is devoted to
the application of this platform to membrane and periplasmic proteins
from electroactive bacteria.

Experimental Section
Reagents
Milli-Q
water (18.2 MΩ cm) was used to prepare all solutions. Cardiolipin
(CL) solution from bovine heart (∼4.7–5.3 mg mL–1 in ethanol, ≥97%) and cytochrome c from equine heart (≥95%) were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich
and stored in a freezer (−18 °C). 1,2-Dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC) powder was purchased
from Avanti Polar Lipids and stored in a freezer. The 10 mM phosphate
buffer aqueous solution at pH 7.2 was prepared by using sodium hydrogen
phosphate anhydrous ACS (99.0% min) and potassium dihydrogen phosphate
ACS (99.0% min) from Alfa Aesar. Anhydrous absolute ethanol from Carlo
Erba Reagents was used to prepare DOPC/CL lipid mixture solutions.
Concentrated hydrochloric acid (12 M, 37%, ACS Reagent) and pellets
for making sodium hydroxide solution (ACS) were obtained from VWR
and were used to adjust the pH of the phosphate buffer solution. Sodium
nitrite (>99%) was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich, and 4-nitrocatechol
(>98%) was obtained from Alfa Aesar.

Electrochemical Measurements
A three-electrode cell with a glassy carbon disk electrode (3 mm
diameter) obtained from BASi as the working electrode, a platinum
wire as the counter electrode, and an Ag/AgCl, KCl 3 M reference electrode
were used to perform all electrochemical measurements. The working
electrode was mirror-polished under a flux of ultrapure water on a
fine grid silicon carbide paper (4000-grid SiC paper, Struers) mounted
on a DAP-V Struers polishing equipment rotating at 75 rpm, then rinsed
and sonicated in ultrapure water for 5 min before each experiment.
Electrochemical experiments were carried out at room temperature (21 ±
3 °C) with an Autolab PGSTAT204 potentiostat/galvanostat (Eco
Chemie B.V., The Netherlands) using Nova as the electrochemical software
(Metrohm). Before each measurement, all solutions were deaerated by
bubbling argon for at least 10 min. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy
measurements were carried out at open circuit potential in the frequency
range from 100 kHz down to 50 mHz, with a signal amplitude of 10 mV
in 10 mM phosphate buffer aqueous solution at pH 7.2.

Surface Modification
Procedures
The catechol grafting on glassy carbon surfaces
was performed by cyclic voltammetry in aqueous acidic solution (0.1
M HCl) containing 1 mM 4-nitrocatechol and 3 mM NaNO2 by
recording 2 cycles between +0.1 and −0.9 V versus Ag/AgCl,
KCl 3 M at a scan rate of 50 mV s–1. Then, the modified
glassy carbon electrode was sonicated in ultrapure water for 2 min.
The supported lipid deposit was obtained by dipping the glassy carbon
electrodes in DOPC/CL lipid mixture solutions (3.4 mM lipids dissolved
in ethanol) for 5 s and then let dry under air (less than 30 s for
complete evaporation of ethanol). After the complete evaporation of
ethanol, the dry electrode was immediately dipped into the 10 mM aqueous
phosphate buffer pH 7.2. Cytochrome c immobilization
on the deposited lipid film was carried out by immersing the electrode
in a 0.15 mM cytochrome c solution and by recording
cyclic voltammetry (10 cycles) between 0.3 and −0.2 V versus
Ag/AgCl, KCl 3 M at a scan rate of 20 mV s–1. Then,
the protein-modified electrode was gently washed with phosphate buffer
solution and transferred to a cytochrome-free phosphate buffer electrolyte
for electrochemical experiments.

Spectrophotometry Measurements
UV–visible absorption spectra were recorded using a UV–visible
spectrophotometer Shimadzu UV-1605 and 1 cm optical length cuvettes.
A 0.15 mM cytochrome c solution in 10 mM phosphate
buffer at pH 7.2 was diluted in a methanol/ethanol/water mixture (1
mL of each solvent) used as blank, to obtain a protein concentration
of 25 nmol L–1. Six modified glassy carbon electrodes
were washed with the same solvent mixture (1 mL methanol + 1 mL ethanol
+ 1 mL ultrapure water), and the presence of cytochrome c was checked by UV–visible spectroscopy in this washing solution.
