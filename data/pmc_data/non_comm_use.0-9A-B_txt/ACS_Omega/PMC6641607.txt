A fused deposition modeling method
was used in this research to
investigate the possibility of improving the mechanical properties
of poly(lactic acid) by changing the thermal conditions of the printing
process. Sample models were prepared while varying a wide range of
printing parameters, including bed temperature, melt temperature,
and raster angle. Certain samples were also thermally treated by annealing.
The prepared materials were subjected to a detailed thermomechanical
analysis (differential scanning calorimetry, dynamic mechanical analysis,
heat deflection temperature (HDT)), which allowed the formulation
of several conclusions. For all prepared samples, the key changes
in mechanical properties are related to the content of the poly(lactic
acid) crystalline phase, which led to superior properties in annealed
samples. The results also indicate the highly beneficial effect of
increased bed temperature, where the best results were obtained for
the samples printed at 105 °C. Compared to the reference samples
printed at a bed temperature of 60 °C, these samples showed the impact
strength increased by 80% (from 35 to 63 J/m), HDT increased by 20
°C (from 55 to 75 °C), and also a significant increase in
strength and modulus. Scanning electron microscopy observations confirmed
the increased level of diffusion between the individual layers of
the printed filament.

==== Body
Introduction
Fused deposition modeling (FDM) is a type
of three-dimensional
(3D) printing where a thermoplastic filament is heated above the melting
temperature and then extruded onto a print surface in layers. It is
applicable to many industries including healthcare, transportation,
housing, and farming, as well as a variety of industrial applications
where there is a benefit from the customization of individual items.1,2 The many benefits of FDM include promoting sustainable, inexpensive
development with decreased material waste, eliminating tooling requirements,
and a significantly shorter supply chain.1,2 The
costs of 3D printers are decreasing, resulting in increased home usage
and the need to better understand the properties of the material being
printed, specifically for load-bearing purposes.1 FDM is currently undergoing a transition from rapid prototyping
to rapid manufacturing. For that reason, new materials, equipment,
and manufacturing procedures need to be developed further.3

Poly(lactic acid) (PLA) is a biobased,
compostable, thermoplastic
polyester obtained from annually renewable resources such as corn
or sugar beets.4 PLA has the potential
to replace petroleum-based thermoplastics, and its low melting point
is a major benefit as it requires less energy to 3D print compared
to that for acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) and polyamides.5,6 PLA has a number of diverse uses, including biomedical and industrial
applications. Its biocompatible and bioresorbable properties provide
many biomedical opportunities, and its good mechanical properties
and compostability are well-suited for industrial applications.4,7 Different crystal structures and degrees of crystallinity can be
developed by varying the thermal history of the material, which allows
for different properties to be tailored depending on the application.5−8

The significant effect of process parameters on the mechanical
properties of the samples created using FDM has been extensively studied
using acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) filaments. Because of
the relatively long process time, selected process parameters can
be monitored in real time. An example of this type of in-line measurements
is the utilization of fiber Bragg grating sensors.9 Simultaneous observation of the stress field and temperature
allows the evaluation of the inter-/intralayer adhesion and distortion
between the rasters, structural inhomogeneity, and thermal history.
These factors have a significant impact on the mechanical properties
of the finished parts.9−12 Highly anisotropic properties were proven to be a function of how
FDM extrudes the filament onto the print surface in layers.13,14 Process parameters including orientation, layer thickness, raster
angle, raster width, air gap, processing temperature, and layout of
samples on the print surface were studied to determine their effect
on the mechanical properties of the ABS samples, and the results were
used to optimize the parameters and greatly improve the mechanical
properties of the 3D printed parts.10,11,14,15

Studies concerning
PLA and the relationship between its crystallinity
and mechanical properties have also been conducted. Harris and Lee4 investigated how manipulating the process parameters,
specifically increasing the annealing time of injection-molded PLA,
would impact the crystallinity and in turn the mechanical properties
of their samples. They found that optimizing the molding cycle as
well as adding nucleating agents enhanced the crystallinity by 37%,
resulting in an increase in flexural strength and modulus by 25% and
heat deflection temperature (HDT) by 30 °C. In addition, constant
crystallinity was observed throughout the parts after annealing.4 Wang et al.6 also
observed in their study of FDM that an increase in crystallinity of
3D printed PLA corresponded to a high impact strength.6 Drummer et al.16 investigated
FDM of PLA filled with tricalcium phosphate. They found that a greater
extruder temperature resulted in increased crystallinity partially
because previous layers deposited and bonded together were reheated
by new filaments being extruded nearby. This was also observed to
affect the tensile strength of the samples.16

Many different process parameters in regard to FDM of PLA
have
been studied. These include the build orientation, layer thickness,
feed rate, plate temperature, uniaxial direction of rasters, distance
between filaments, extruder temperature, and color. All were found
to have varying degrees of impact on the mechanical properties of
3D printed PLA.5,17−20 Tymrak et al.19 quantified the tensile strength and elastic modulus of
PLA 3D printed under realistic environmental conditions on RepRap
printers. Process parameters were not defined, and it was observed
that the variety of different settings utilized had a large effect
on the structure and properties of the samples. A high extruder temperature
was found to result in increased thermal bonding and inter-/intralayer
lamination and resulted in a higher tensile strength.19 Variation in the unidirectional raster orientation has
also been studied with regard to FDM of PLA and was found to alter
the mechanical properties of the parts. In one case, the ultimate
tensile strength increased 55% with the change in raster angle.20−22 The effect of annealing on the crystallinity of the 3D printed PLA
parts was briefly reviewed, with results indicating no change when
the printed samples were annealed below the Tg; however, a reduction in strength between 10 and 30% was
observed.22

The majority of research
concerning the impact of printing parameters
on the mechanical properties of 3D printed components usually focuses
on ABS-based materials, analyzing the impact of a wide spectrum of
variables and predicting properties based on numerical simulations.23−25 In addition to the most frequently analyzed machine parameters,
such as nozzle diameter, layer orientation, or printing speed, PLA-related
research also often includes temperature parameters and additional
thermal treatment.22,26 The main goal of the presented
research was a comprehensive assessment of the most important factors
from each of the parameter categories to provide a reliable evaluation
of the benefits. On the basis of literature sources, the selection
of variable parameters included the temperature of the printer nozzle
and bed. The raster angle orientation was chosen as the main machine
factor. Annealing treatment was chosen as the additional process-independent
factor. For verification and comparative purposes, injection-molded
samples were also prepared.

Results and Discussion
Correlation of Thermal
Parameters with the Density of FDM-Printed
Samples
The viscosity graphs shown in Figure 1 present the results of the frequency sweep
measurements at various temperatures. Rheological tests can confirm
only the viscosity changes occurring within the printing nozzle, which
do not translate into real material viscosity after leaving the nozzle.
In addition, it can be noted that any increase in print temperature
can lead to the intensification of degradation phenomena, which is
evident from the reducing viscosity in the low deformation frequency
range. In the case of FDM techniques, these changes have a negligible
effect on material degradation because the residence time of the material
in the nozzle is very short. Even at temperatures significantly greater
than the recommended printing conditions, it does not usually lead
to visible changes in the quality of the model, which has also been
confirmed by other researchers.27 This
is primarily due to the very nature of the FDM printing method, as
the material flowing from the nozzle, even with a significant reduction
in viscosity, is rapidly cooled down when it comes in contact with
the ground surface.

Figure 1 Complex viscosity plot measured at different temperatures,
reflecting
the variations of the printing nozzle temperature.

Dimensional accuracy of the FDM models also largely
depends on
the viscosity of the material used; in this case, the viscosity decrease
usually has a negative impact on the model mapping, which is related
to the inability to accurately controlling the height of the extruded
material path. However, the high viscosity that allows for a proper
control of the layer height of the model also increases the content
of free spaces between the paths. The 3D model structure shown in Figure 2 presents the sample
prepared at the parameters optimized to obtain the high dimensional
accuracy of the model (bed temp = 60 °C; melt temp = 210 °C).
The proper selection of the printing parameters is indicated by the
constant distance of 200 μm between the successive voids. These
voids occur at the intersection of consecutive layers, and the distance
between them corresponds to the height of a single layer of the deposited
filament given by the printer program.

structure after injection molding processing
and under optimal conditions of the FDM printing process.

Unlike conventional polymer processing techniques
such as extrusion
and injection molding, FDM printing does not allow for a wide variation
of the flow characteristics through appropriate parameter selection.
The viscosity of the polymer melt depends mainly on the temperature
gradient between the print nozzle and the surface of the rising model.
Most commonly used 3D printers offer the ability to controlling only
the bed and nozzle temperatures, which simply leads to the need for
multiple comparative tests to optimize the range of both temperature
variations.10 Because the temperature range
of both the melt and bed was relatively wide in the presented studies,
changes in these parameters also caused changes in the degree of filling
of the resulting sample models. The density values presented in Figure 3 show a comparison
of the specific density measurements for samples printed at variable
bed and nozzle temperatures. These results are also confirmed by the
scanning electron microscope (SEM) picture presented in the same figure;
the discussed images represent printed samples prepared at extremely
different bed temperatures, 45 and 105 °C, respectively. The
results confirmed the more significant consequences of bed temperature
changes on the model’s filling level. Similar conclusions were
formulated by Wang et al.;6 however, in
their research, the bed temperature was the main variable and the
temperature range was very high (from 30 to 160 °C).

Figure 3 Density variations
for different thermal conditions in the printing
process. The picture comparison reflects the raster area cross section
from high-porosity samples (bed temperature of 45 °C) and low-porosity
samples (bed temperature of 105 °C).

In the case of density analysis, it is worth mentioning that
for
most of the parts printed with FDM techniques the filling density
is often reduced in a targeted manner to reduce the material consumption
and also the dimension accuracy.28 This
modification occurs by reducing the density of the model’s
filing mesh, while maintaining the solid structure of the shell layer.
With such a constructed model, it is of course not possible to obtain
the maximum possible strength of the samples, but taking into account
the significant mass reduction, this operation has many advantages.

Taking into account the main objective of the research, which is
to increase the mechanical performance of PLA-based 3D models, the
porosity (void content) measured during the density measurements was
only 5.5% in the worst case of samples printed at the bed temperature
of 45 °C. Surprisingly, the density of the samples printed at
the highest bed temperature (90 and 105 °C) does not differ from
the values obtained for injection-molded samples, which proves not
only very small porosity content but also confirms the density changes
of PLA itself caused by increased crystallinity, which was observed
for PLA previously.29 According to numerous
studies,30,31 the density of fully amorphous PLA is 1.248
g/cm3, whereas that of 100% crystalline PLA is 1.290 g/cm3, which may confirm the unexpected increase in specific density
for selected samples.

Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) Measurements:
Crystallinity
Evaluation
Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was employed
to determine the degree of crystallinity of the FDM samples as well
as to gain an insight into the influence of sample thermal history
on basic thermomechanical properties. The changes in the crystallinity
level for printed samples can be seen in Figure 4; the basic thermal properties are listed
in Table 1.

thermal conditions and injection-molded samples (DSM).

It can be seen from Figure 5 that the variation
of the print temperature of the samples
did not have a significant effect on the crystallinity or the melting
peak. Some visible changes can be considered as negligible because
they do not show any trend and generally are within the range of measurement
error. Although crystallization half time (t1/2) decreases as the crystallization temperature (Tc) increases, with the crystal growth rate considered
proportional, this has been reported to be true only up to around
110 °C for pure PLA. At this point, the crystallization process
becomes slower as the Tc increases, which
was observed by Sánchez et al.32 in a series of measurements of PLA crystallization kinetics. Although
the print temperatures are much higher than the boundary temperature
of 110 °C, the temperature fluctuation from the extruded filament
and the rapid cooling after deposition do not keep the filament at
the elevated temperature long enough for a significant difference
in crystallinity to occur. This has in turn been reported in other
studies, when bed temperatures reached 160 °C (close to the PLA
melting point).6 The presence of a small
double melting peak in the DSC signal can be observed for most of
the samples. This is a result of the α′ crystal structure
melting and then recrystallizing into its α form with tighter
and more ordered chain packing; this phenomenon is quite widely described
by di Lorenzo et al.33 for PLA-based materials.34,35 Because there are so few α crystal structures as assumed from
the very slight melting peak, the elongation at break and the modulus
of the samples were not seen to be affected. All of the samples printed at varying print
temperatures had no significant changes in their mechanical properties,
apart from the samples printed at a temperature of 190 °C. This
indicates that although having the same degree of crystallinity as
that of the other samples there are other factors involved in determining
the mechanical properties of the samples. The bonding between the
filaments is also affected by the thermal history of the samples,
and unsatisfactory bond strength between the filaments will lead to
poor mechanical properties, regardless of the degree of crystallinity
the sample has obtained. Because the filament diameter was so small,
the printing temperature was seen to have a negligible effect on the
crystallinity, as well as the mechanical properties of the samples
(apart from the lowest print temperature).12

Figure 5 Comparison
of the DSC curves obtained from the 1st heating stage
for PLA samples printed at different melt temperatures and injection-molded
PLA.

As seen in Figure 6, varying the bed temperature of the FDM
samples had a significant
effect on their degree of crystallinity achieved, cold crystallization,
and melting peak. The cold crystallization peak enthalpy was reduced
greatly as the bed temperature increased gradually from 45 to 105
°C, indicating the increase in sample crystallinity. Also, the
transition from α′ to α crystals could be observed
as the bed temperature increased. Up to the bed temperature of 75
°C, the shape of the DSC curves remain similar with a sharp melting
peak at around 150 °C. Visible changes are observed for the sample
printed at 90 °C, where top of the melting peak is clearly flattened,
which is potentially the result of the convolution of two melting
peaks. Two clearly defined melting peaks appear for samples printed
at 105 °C; this phenomenon, already described in the literature,
indicates the existence of two separate crystalline structures, formed
as a result of different crystallization kinetics.32,36 A large increase in overall crystallinity was observed for the whole
observed range of bed temperature from 45 to 105 °C. The crystallinity
level of 1.5% reported for the samples printed at the lowest bed temperature
of 45 °C is most similar to the value obtained for injection-molded
samples. The greater impact of bed temperature changes could be a
result of shifting the crystallization regimes. This gradual change
in crystallization kinetics, described in detail by Saeidlou et al.,7 is associated with a favorable transition of
thermodynamic conditions from regime III (where the low chain motion
limits the lamella growth) to regime II (where the crystal growth
occurs from prolific multiple nucleation at a lower temperature, resulting
in a faster crystallization process). For PLA samples, this transition
phenomenon has been reported to occur at around 120 °C but again,
with the fluctuating temperature cycles and the print temperature
decreasing rapidly, it is difficult to say the exact average temperature
each print achieved. The change of regimes promotes increased and
faster crystallization, as evidenced by the increase in crystallinity.7 The regime change and growth of two crystal structures
were found to occur at the same temperature and are both associated
with the double melting peak.

Figure 6 Comparison of the DSC curves obtained from the
1st heating stage
for PLA samples printed at different bed temperatures and injection-molded
PLA.

Although the increased bed temperature
caused a significant increase
in crystallinity and mechanical properties, this effect may be lost
in the case of printing real models. Because of their geometry and
size, it would be difficult to maintain identical thermal conditions
of printing, as is the case with research samples. This problem is
indicated by numerous studies,37,38 especially because
this problem concerns not only the level of crystallinity but also
an equally important issue regarding the weld formation of individual
model layers.39,40 The role of these factors becomes
even more important if we take into account the growing importance
of large-scale additive manufacturing technology, where the maximum
size of printed elements reaches several meters, which causes numerous
problems related to the need to ensure thermal stability on such a
large scale.41,42 The classical solution to most
of the problems related to the heterogeneity of the 3D model structure
is post-processing. For PLA especially, annealing allows us to obtain
measurable benefits, especially in the context of improving mechanical
properties.6,22 Post-print annealing was done
to observe the effects on the samples and to evaluate whether it would
be a viable method of obtaining the same outcomes on parts with different
dimensions. Different variations of 3D printers for FDM exist and
include models with the print area in an enclosed space with the option
to adjust the ambient temperature.

Two sets of samples 3D printed
at a bed temp of 60 °C and
print temperature of 200 °C were annealed at 80 and 100 °C
for 1 h each. Harris and Lee found that annealing longer did not increase
the crystallinity after 1 h (annealed at 80 °C).4 The maximum crystallinity of PLA is reported to be just
below 45%; however, the maximum crystallinity achieved with the studied
samples was around 30%. There was not a significant increase in crystallinity
between the two different annealing temperatures (see Figure 7); however, the appearance
of the melting peaks was quite different. The 80 °C annealed
sample displayed a double melting peak, indicating the formation of
two different crystalline structures, α and α′.
The 100 °C annealed sample had a single wide peak; perhaps, the
two melting peaks were superimposed, indicating that there were more
α crystals formed. Further supporting that theory, when observing
the mechanical properties, the mechanical properties are quite different
despite only a small difference in crystallinity.

Figure 7 Comparison of the DSC
1st heating curves for injection-molded samples
and FDM-printed specimens before and after annealing.

The injection-molded sample displayed low crystallinity.
This was
mainly due to the fact that the grades of PLA used in 3D printing
are intended mainly for the production of film,43 which in the end improves the dimensional stability of
the products by reducing the shrinkage but also reveals the majority
of defects caused by the amorphous structure of the material. Cold
crystallization and a single melting peak of prepared samples indicated
that there were only α prime crystals formed during this process.
Despite being one of the samples with the lowest degree of crystallinity,
all of the mechanical properties displayed were among the highest
with the exception of the notched Izod impact strength, which was
similar to that of samples 3D printed at lower bed temperatures.19,28

Mechanical Tests
The values of the basic mechanical
parameters obtained from static tensile/flexural testing and impact
resistance measurements are collected in Table 2. Most important changes in the strength
and modulus followed similar trends, both in tensile and flexural
tests (see Figure 8).

In the case of printed samples, changes in mechanical properties
follow the increase in the crystallinity of PLA; this is evident for
samples printed at constant nozzle and variable bed temperatures.
In the case of variable nozzle temperature, changes in strength and
modulus were not so evident because the content of crystalline phase
for this group of samples does not change significantly. The comparative
analysis of the 3D printed, molded, and annealed samples is presented
in Figure 9 for tensile
properties and in Figure 10 for flexural properties. Summarized results of elongation
at break and impact resistance measurements are collected in Figure 11. From the comparison
graphs, it can be seen that in the case of printed samples the rise
in bed temperature from 60 to 105 °C causes a significant increase
in mechanical properties. It is worth mentioning that this procedure
results in comparable or even slightly higher mechanical properties
than those obtained for injection-molded samples. This comparison
also shows very favorable properties for annealed samples, both the
modulus and the strength match the properties of the samples printed
at the maximum bed temperature. However, an important advantage of
annealing is a significant increase in impact strength compared to
that of other printed samples (see Figure 12). It should be added here that the increase
in impact strength is very significant, especially compared to that
of injection-molded samples. Such a large difference indicates a very
significant effect of the highly crystalline structures of the printed
samples. Although in static measurements some predominance of the
molded samples was visible, the impact tests confirm the great importance
of the macromolecular structure formation, especially in the context
of fracture mechanisms. This dependence has been already described
in the literature also for PLA.6,44−46 Along with thicker lamellae and ideal crystals, annealing can create
different interlamellar regions, including the rigid amorphous phase
and the mobile amorphous phase.47,48 The injection-molded
sample with a crystallinity of 1.5% had tensile properties very similar
to those of the sample 3D printed at a bed temperature of 105 °C
and a corresponding crystallinity of 18%. These results indicate that
the tensile strength and modulus are dependent mostly on other factors,
not just the degree of crystallinity. This is corroborated by the
large variety of properties displayed in samples with similar crystallinities
but different processing histories. Thermal bonding of filaments and
crystal size may have contributed to this, as annealing creates larger
crystals and temperature fluctuation was found to create smaller ones.
Some sets of samples display a much higher standard deviation than
others. This has been attributed to an unstable morphology where some
of the polymer chains are more mobile than others, leading to a greater
fluctuation in results.48 Both the flexural
strength and modulus increased with the increase in crystallinity.
As was seen with the tensile properties, all of the samples with crystallinity
of ∼5% have different flexural properties. The properties vary
depending on the processing history, regardless of the degree of crystallinity.
Unlike the tensile properties, the flexural modulus and strength both
increase slightly with annealing.

samples under different thermal conditions.

The injection-molded samples had properties similar to those
of
the most promising 3D printed samples (FDM at a bed temperature of
105 °C), despite the large difference in crystallinity. The poor
bonding between the filaments of the FDM samples was compensated by
their favorable highly crystalline structure. The properties were
comparable across all categories, with the exceptions of elongation
at break values, where the injection-molded samples were higher. In
turn, the notched Izod impact strength of the 3D printed samples was
stronger. Both discrepancies can be attributed to the large difference
in crystallinity, as increasing crystallinity has been shown to increase
the impact strength as well as decrease the elongation at break.6 A combination of low crystallinity and homogenous
structure allowed the injection-molded sample to have a significantly
greater maximum deformation than that of the FDM samples, in which
elongation is mostly reduced because of stress concentration on the
filament bonding surfaces.

The serious limitation related to
the increasing temperatures of
printing is dimensional stability; the samples began to warp and had
difficulty adhering to the print surface.49,50 Green painter’s tape was applied to the print surface for
samples printed at 90 and 105 °C to promote the adhesion of the
samples to the print surface. Although there was significant improvement
in the adhesion, there was still some warping observed on a number
of samples. This had a negligible effect on the mechanical properties;
they still increased with the increasing crystallinity and bed temperatures.
Depending on the quality of the surface finish and accuracy of dimensions
required, it is not feasible to increase the bed temperature further
with the current filament and print surface.

In previous studies,21,51 the mechanical characteristics
for a unidirectional raster angle were found to reduce when the raster
angle was increased from 0 to 90°. The 90° angle was also
observed to make the sample more brittle.21 For this study, the 45/45° raster angle was overall the most
consistent and stable of the angles. There was not a significant difference
between most of the properties when compared. This is a result of
the multidirectional nature of the filament in the sample. All previous
studies were completed on unidirectional raster angles and, as a result,
saw a much larger difference in properties. The flexural modulus was
the only property where the 15/75 and 30/60° angles were superior.

Most of the values of strength and modulus for samples printed
at 75 °C and above are very similar; taking into account the
standard deviation values, these differences are negligible. In our
opinion, this is a beneficial behavior, especially taking into account
that similar properties were obtained after injection molding of the
same material. The mechanical characterization as presented in the
article is aimed at highlighting the differences for samples printed
with the use of heated printing bed and without it (such as for low-cost
desktop printers). In contrast to impact strength, where the PLA crystallinity
level is very important for results, most of the parameters obtained
in static samples are very stable even for samples with different
printing parameters.

Dynamic Mechanical Analysis (DMA) and Heat
Deflection Temperature
Changes
For most of the tested samples, the significant changes
in mechanical characteristics are mainly caused by the changing content
of the crystalline phase. This trend applies in particular to impact
resistance. For PLA, the same dependence leads to an increase in thermal
resistance parameters, such as heat deflection temperatures (HDTs)
or Vicat temperatures. Previously, an inverse relationship between
HDT and impact strength has been reported;48,52,53 however, this was not observed in the present
study. The results showed that as the crystallinity increased, so
did both the HDT54 and the impact strength,
which has been previously reported for FDM-printed PLA composites.26 Usually, a low softening point limits the range
of application of PLA to 50–60 °C, which corresponds to
the glass-transition region of its amorphous phase. The analysis of
the DMA thermograms complements the DSC measurements in terms of changes
in mechanical properties. As can be seen in Figure 13, in the glassy state, the highest value
of storage modulus belongs to the injection-molded samples; similar
values were reported for the printed samples after the annealing treatment.
In the case of storage modulus, the initial room temperature values
reflect the two dominant phenomena also observed in the previous analysis.
The lowest values are observed for the samples prepared at the lowest
range of printing parameters, respectively, the bed and melt temperatures.
The apparent change occurs when both of the printing parameters are
raised to higher values.

Figure 13 Thermograms of storage modulus (A) and tan δ
(B) for
samples obtained with different preparation methodologies.

The importance of crystallinity becomes more evident
at around
55 °C, when the majority of the tested samples reached the maximum
deflection point in the HDT measurement (see Figure 14); this also applies to the injection-molded
specimens. The difference in this aspect is in favor of the annealed
samples. The highest HDT values were observed in both annealed samples.
A significant increase was also observed for samples printed at the
highest bed temperature (105 °C). Despite the difference in the
initial value of storage modulus in both of these examples, the DMA
thermograms have a very similar course, with apparently less reduction
in stiffness at the relaxation stage, because of the lower content
of the amorphous phase. This difference is particularly evident in
the tan δ plots (Figure 13B), where for the samples printed at the highest bed
temperature and the annealed samples, the additional cold crystallization
peak does not occur, whereas for the rest of the samples it is clearly
marked. This type of behavior has already been reported for PLA and
its blends.35,55

levels for injection-molded
samples and FDM-printed specimens.

Structure Evaluation
Some of the structural changes
resulting from changes in crystallinity for selected samples can be
easily assessed using thermal analysis. However, in the case of tested
samples, some trends of changes in mechanical properties cannot be
correlated with the PLA phase morphology, particularly for samples
printed with variable melt temperatures. In this case, the most important
factor affecting the mechanical characteristics is the bonding strength
between the individual layers of the printed material. For optimal
selection of the parameters, the temperature of the polymer melt should
allow partial melting of the previously applied layer. Under such
conditions, diffusion is possible at the boundary of both printed
layers, which in consequence not only provides better mechanical properties
but also improves the surface quality of the printed model. Comparisons
of samples printed at low and high nozzle temperatures reveal significant
differences in the structure, which was reported previously for other
FDM-printed polymers.37,51

For comparative purposes,
cross sections of samples were presented both in the interior raster
area of the specimen and on the edge of the sample where individual
layers of filament form the so-called shell layer. In all printed
samples, the outer layer of the sample is characterized by the large
size of the trapezoidal holes. This indicates a rapid cooling of the
material, which prevented the extruded filament from filling the free
space of the model. However, the first significant differences can
be observed by comparing the change in pore size within the interior
of both samples. For low printing nozzle temperatures (Figure 15B), the size of the holes
remained practically unchanged relative to that of the shell layer.
In turn, for high printing nozzle temperatures, the pore size is significantly
reduced in the raster area (Figure 15B′). Some similar trends were also reported
in other studies.12,40 However, considering the changes
in the density of the samples, the apparent difference in pore size
is not significantly influencing the total volume of voids, which
should not significantly affect the mechanical properties. The more
significant structural differences are visible within the joining
lines of the individual layers of materials. A visible enlargement
of the pore area suggests a clear lack of diffusion between filament
layers for samples printed at 190 °C (see Figure 15C,D). A clear bonding line is visible throughout
the structure of the entire model; thus, the reduced mechanical properties
in this case are clearly due to the poor diffusion and lack of consistency
between the individual layers of the filament.

at different melt temperatures. Structures
of the sample cross sections showing the
shell area (A, A′), raster area (B, B′), and enlargement
of the void area (C, C′, D, and D′).

Similar trends in structural changes can also be
observed in the
case of variable bed temperature. In this case, the pore size difference
for the shell layer and raster area is even more visible. For samples
printed at 105 °C, the viscosity of the already applied filament
layers remains low enough to fill the free space of the model, leading
to a nearly completely solid structure in the raster area, which is
not possible for the outer/shell layer because of intensive heat exchange
with the environment (Figure 16). A closer view at the void area also reveals some structural
changes. As was observed with low nozzle temperatures, the reduction
of the bed temperature also limits the diffusion process, leading
to reduced interfacial adhesion between the printed layers.

specimens at different bed temperatures. Structure

Conclusions
By
optimizing the printing parameters and with the introduction
of post-print annealing, FDM samples of PLA were created with mechanical
properties comparable and in some cases superior to those of their
injection-molded counterparts. Variation in the melt temperature did
not result in a significant change in the sample morphology; however,
an increase in the bed temperature resulted in a large increase in
crystallinity, providing a significant increase in the thermal resistance
(HDT). From all of the mechanical characteristics, the impact strength
was observed to be the most dependent on the degree of crystallinity,
whereas the other tensile and flexural properties did not show such
a significant improvement. However, increasing the bed temperature
clearly improved both the modulus and strength of the samples. The
45/45° raster angle was consistently observed to be the ideal
orientation of the filaments for optimal mechanical properties, though
this factor seems to have a negligible impact. The observed changes
allow us to conclude that in the case of FDM printing, the most favorable
changes in thermomechanical properties of PLA-based samples are the
result of post-processing annealing. Despite the necessity of using
additional energy and time-consuming treatments, annealing of the
finished elements has a significant advantage over applying high bed
temperatures during the printing process. Post-processing allows the
application of optimal printing conditions, which is important for
improving the dimensional accuracy of models. In the presented studies,
the main emphasis was placed on the improvement of mechanical properties.
Hence, the bed temperature was mostly kept above the glass-transition
temperature to maximize the bonding strength between deposited layers.
The Tg value for PLA is around 60 °C,
which results in fairly easy printing, even without a heated printing
bed platform.

Experimental Section
Materials
The
material used for all samples was a commercial
PLA filament from polymaker(True Red PolyLite PLA). Like most of the
commercially available materials, this PLA was supplied in the form
of a bobbin with a wound filament line, with a diameter of 2.85 mm.
Because of proprietary reasons, it was not known what nucleating agents
or plasticizers were added, if any.

Sample Preparation
Fused
Deposition Modeling
The fused layer modeling
was performed using a LulzbotTaz 6 3D printer. Except the raster angle,
all of the other machine parameters were kept constant, including
a print speed of 50 mm/s, a travel speed of 200 mm/s, and a 100% fill
density. The print time was also kept constant at 6.5 h for each variable
printing parameter. Seven impact samples and five each of tensile
and flexural samples were printed at a time. Painter’s tape
was laid out on the print surface for samples printed at bed temperatures
of 90 and 105 °C to promote adhesion of the samples to the print
surface.6

Injection Molding
Before injection molding, the filament
was pelletized using a Reduction Engineering Bullet 64 pelletizer.
After pelletizing, the pellets were dried for 16 h in the oven at
75 °C. Injection molding took place in a DSM 15cc micro compounder
and injection molder following ASTM D3641 standards for PLA processing.
The mold temperature was set at 30 °C, the barrel temperature
at 180 °C, the injection pressure at 4 bar, and the hold pressure
at 8 bar. Five flexural, five tensile, and seven impact samples were
formed. Before testing, the samples were stored for 40 h at room temperature.

Annealing
To evaluate the effects of annealing on the
mechanical properties of 3D printed models, it was decided to process
only one type of prepared specimens. Before the annealing step, the
samples were printed at a nozzle temperature of 210 °C and a
bed temperature of 60 °C and a 45/45° raster angle and all
other printing parameters were the same as those in the previous prints.
They were then annealed in the oven for 1 h, the first set of samples
at 80 °C and the second at 100 °C.

Characterization
Thermal
Analysis (DSC, DMA, HDT)
Using TA Instruments
DSC Q200, the thermal properties of the samples were studied. Two
tests per sample were performed to create a standard deviation. Approximately,
5 mg was cut from each sample and was encapsulated in aluminum. With
a 50 mL/min–1 nitrogen flow rate, the samples were
ramped at 5.00 °C/min using a heat/cool/heat method. The crystallinity
of the samples was calculated using the following formula 1  where ΔHm is the measured melting enthalpy, ΔHcc is the measured enthalpy of cold crystallization, and
ΔHm0 is the theoretical melting enthalpy of 100%
crystalline PLA, taken
from the literature to be 93.7 J/g4.

Dynamic thermal
analysis (DMA) was performed with the use of a DMA Q800 (TA Instruments,
New Castle, DE). All measurements were carried out at a constant frequency
of 1 Hz and strain amplitude of 0.01%. The temperature range was 30–150
°C, whereas the heating rate was 3 °C/min. The viscoelastic
properties were collected from rectangular samples (3.2 × 12.7
× 50 mm) using the dual cantilever measurement mode.

The
heat deflection temperature (HDT) of the samples was acquired
using TA Instruments DMA Q800 following ASTM D648. The desired stress
of 0.455 MPa was applied to the midsection of the sample, and a heating
rate of 2 °C/min was utilized. The strain rate was measured at
250 μm (0.2% strain), and two tests were performed on each type
of sample.

Measurements of Mechanical Properties (Tensile/Flexural/Notched
Izod)
The tensile and flexural testings were completed using
an Instron 3382 Universal Testing Machine, following ASTM D638 and
D790, respectively. The rate of the tensile testing crosshead speed
was 5 mm/min, and the rate of the flexural testing crosshead speed
was 14 mm/min. Before the samples were tested, they were stored at
room temperature for 40 h after printing or injection molding. The
impact testing was completed using a TMI 43-02 notched Izod impact
tester with a 5 ft-lb hammer following ASTM D256. Before testing the
samples, they were stored for 40 h after notching using a TMI notching
cutter. Five samples were used in all tests to produce a standard
deviation

Morphology, Density, and Viscosity of the
Materials
The morphology of the fractured surface of notched
Izod samples was
investigated by a Phenom ProX SEM microscope using a 10 kV acceleration
voltage. The surface of the samples was coated with a thin layer of
gold. Density measurements were conducted using an MD300 densimeter
(Alfa Mirage Co., Osaka, Japan) according to ASTM D792 standard methodology.
Rheological measurements were conducted using an MCR 302 rheometer
(Anton Paar GmbH, Graz, Austria). The configuration used was plate–plate
geometry with a gap distance of 1 mm. The strain amplitude was set
at 5%, and the angular frequency range was varied from 0.01 to 500
s–1. Measurements were conducted under a nitrogen
atmosphere at different temperatures from 190 to 230 °C, reflecting
the melt temperatures selected for the printing process.
