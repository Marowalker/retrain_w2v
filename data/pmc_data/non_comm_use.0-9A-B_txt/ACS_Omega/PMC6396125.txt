Bacterial ATP-binding cassette transporters
are a superfamily of
transport systems involved in the import of various molecules including
amino acids, ions, sugars, and peptides. In the lactic acid bacteria Lactococcus lactis, the oligopeptide-binding protein
A (OppA) binds peptides for import to support nitrogen metabolism
and cell growth. The OppA protein is of great interest because it
can bind peptides over a broad variety of lengths and sequences; however,
current methods to study peptide binding have employed low throughput,
endpoint, or low dynamic range techniques. Therefore, in this study,
we developed a fluorescence anisotropy-based peptide-binding assay
that can be readily employed to quantify OppA function. To test the
utility of our assay, we characterized the pH dependence of oligopeptide
binding because L. lactis is commonly
used in fermentation and often must survive in low pH environments
caused by lactic acid export. We determined that OppA affinity increases
as pH or temperature decreases, and circular dichroism spectroscopy
further indicated that acidic conditions increase the thermal stability
of the protein, increasing the unfolding transition temperature by
10 °C from pH 8 to pH 6. Thus, our fluorescence anisotropy assay
provides an easy technique to measure peptide binding, and it can
be used to understand molecular aspects of OppA function under stress
conditions experienced during fermentation and other biotechnology
applications.

==== Body
Introduction
The lactic acid bacteria Lactococcus lactis is vital to the dairy industry
and has become a synthetic biology
platform for recombinant protein production, metabolic engineering,
and the development of probiotics and vaccines.1−8 Like many bacteria, L. lactis relies
on extracellular peptides as a major source of nutrients to support
carbon and nitrogen metabolism, and peptide transport plays an important
role in bacterial growth and survival. In general, bacteria can utilize
proton-coupled transporters and ATP-binding cassette (ABC)-type transporters
to import di-, tri-, and oligopeptides. For L. lactis, which is a branched-chain amino acid auxotroph, the oligopeptide
ABC transporter is necessary for growth on natural substrates such
as milk casein peptides.9−14 The oligopeptide ABC transporter is a multi-subunit complex consisting
of two transmembrane proteins (OppB and OppC), two ATP-binding proteins
(OppD and OppF), and a substrate-binding protein [oligopeptide-binding
protein A (OppA)].12 The L. lactis OppA is part of a superfamily of substrate-binding
proteins that share a similar overall tertiary structure and domain
organization.15−17

OppA is particularly interesting because it
has a broad capacity
to bind peptides of varying lengths and sequences18−25 unlike other substrate-binding proteins that have high specificity
for ligands such as metal cofactors and sugars.15−17,26,27 The crystal structures
of several OppA proteins from diverse bacteria have been solved, including
that of L. lactis OppA.17,28−31 In general, substrate-binding proteins consist of two domains connected
by a hinge region with the substrate-binding pocket located between
the two domains. Upon binding substrate, the protein undergoes a conformational
change from open to closed as it clamps down on the substrate, which
is known as the “Venus flytrap” mechanism.26,27,30,32 The OppA proteins also undergo the canonical substrate-dependent
conformational change (Figure 1), but they have an additional third domain that increases
the size of the binding pocket, which classifies them as a cluster
C substrate-binding protein.28−30 The L. lactis OppA accepts peptides ranging from 4 to 35 residues in length with
a preference for hydrophobic and basic ligands. Overall, it has relatively
low specificity for the peptide sequence, which is likely because
hydrogen bonds are almost exclusively formed between the protein and
the peptide backbone and not with peptide side chains.18−25 The crystal structures of L. lactis OppA reveal that the peptide-binding site is a large, aqueous cavity
with a single hydrophobic pocket that can accommodate a bulky residue.
Crystal structures with peptide bound show that the termini of peptides
are not in fixed positions and peptides of same length and composition
but differing sequences can bind different registers.29,31 Thus, peptide selection is based on composition rather than exact
sequence, which allows OppA to import a wide range of peptides for
nutrients.

Figure 1 Fluorescence anisotropy peptide-binding assays used to quantify
relative changes in L. lactis OppA
binding affinity. (A) Substrate peptide binding causes a “Venus
flytrap” conformational change from an open state (PDB 3DRK) to a closed state
(PDB 3DRG).
(B) Dye-labeled peptide rotates freely in solution with low fluorescence
anisotropy. Once bound to OppA, the fluorescent peptide–OppA
complex rotates more slowly, causing an increase in fluorescence anisotropy.
(C) For competition binding assays, the fluorescent peptide is prebound
to OppA. The unlabeled peptide displaces the fluorescent peptide,
causing a decrease in fluorescence anisotropy. Green, blue, and orange
indicate lobes Ia, Ib, and II in the protein structures, respectively.
The unlabeled peptide is pink, and the dye-labeled peptide is shown
in red with a star.

While the specificity
of OppA peptide binding and its role in nutrient
import have been well-established, no studies have been performed
to characterize the peptide-binding properties of OppA under stress
conditions. Lactic acid bacteria frequently experience stress conditions
particularly when used in food fermentation.33L. lactis exhibits optimal growth
at pH 6.3 and at 30 °C; thus, stress conditions could include
both pH and temperature changes that still reside within mesophilic
ranges.34,35 Furthermore, several studies have shown
differential expression of genes involved in amino acid metabolism
under stress conditions, including and implicating OppA in stress
response.36−38 Thus, in this study, we developed a fluorescence
anisotropy assay that can be used to measure the effects of pH and
temperature on peptide binding to the L. lactis OppA protein. To quantify relative changes in OppA function and
structure, we used a combination of our fluorescence anisotropy peptide-binding
assays and circular dichroism (CD). We discovered that increased peptide
affinity under acidic conditions correlates with increased structural
stability and neutralization of surface charge within the substrate-binding
pocket, pointing to a potential molecular adaptation to the optimal
growth conditions for L. lactis.

Results
Development
of a Fluorescence Anisotropy Assay for OppA Peptide
Binding
To quantify relative differences in OppA peptide
affinity, we developed fluorescence anisotropy peptide-binding assays
because they are nonradioactive solution-state assays that offer high
signal over background with a good dynamic range and ease of execution.39−41 We based our assay on the binding of a sulforhodamine 101 (SR101)-labeled
peptide to OppA (Figure 1). We chose SR101 because it is commercially available for custom
dye-modified peptide synthesis and it is water-soluble, bright, and
has a fluorescence lifetime of ∼4.2 ns that makes it sensitive
to polarization changes upon binding large molecular weight proteins.
As described below, SR101 was highly effective as an anisotropy reporter,
and therefore, we did not test other fluorophores. However, in principle,
our assay should work with other dyes.

We then chose to conjugate
SR101 to the bradykinin peptide (RPPGFSPFR) because it has previously
been used to characterize peptide binding to OppA. Bradykinin is a
peptide hormone that is vital to endocrine signaling throughout mammalian
tissues, including the gut. In theory, it is also an example of an
endogenous peptide that could be used as a nutrient, though it is
not clear that L. lactis would encounter
high concentrations of bradykinin in the gut lumen. For the purpose
of this study, the primary reason we chose to use bradykinin is because
bradykinin has been used extensively in other functional assays for
the Opp-transport system.23,25,42,43 Furthermore, we also chose to
label bradykinin because it is the highest affinity ligand reported
for L. lactis OppA (KD = 0.1 μM),21 which
we hypothesized would mitigate any loss of affinity caused by conjugation
to SR101. As demonstrated in our results, the SR101-conjugated bradykinin
provided excellent anisotropy detection characteristics, and therefore,
we did not screen other peptides to label.

We initially tested
OppA binding using bradykinin that was labeled
on either its N- or C-terminus (SR101-RPPGFSPFR and RPPGFSPFRK-SR101).
The C-terminal configuration included a lysine residue that was necessary
for coupling to the dye (Figure 1) (Figure S3). To determine
the affinities of the two different dye-labeled peptide configurations,
direct-binding dose response curves were performed with varying concentrations
of OppA (Figure 2).
The affinities of OppA for the N and C-terminally labeled bradykinin
were determined to be 45 ± 3 and 13.1 ± 0.7 μM, respectively
(mean ± stdev, n = 3). The higher affinity for
the C-terminally labeled peptide aligns well with previous studies
that showed that OppA tolerates large bulky groups on the C-terminus
of a peptide but not the N-terminus.22 Additionally,
the crystal structure of OppA in complex with bradykinin reveals that
the entire peptide can be accommodated within the binding pocket,
with the N-terminus buried more deeply within the binding pocket compared
to the C-terminus.29 The additional lysine
residue on the C-terminally labeled peptide may also contribute to
the higher affinity relative to the N-terminally labeled peptide.
The higher affinity C-terminally labeled peptide, referred to as “bradykinin-SR101”,
was selected for use in subsequent assays because of its greater binding
affinity, which provided good sensitivity to binding over a range
of submicromolar to millimolar concentrations. Using bradykinin-SR101,
our assay exhibited a dynamic range with a maximal increase of 0.201 ±
0.002 in fluorescence anisotropy between the free and OppA-bound states,
and the reproducibility was excellent across independent protein preparations
(Figure 2).

Figure 2 Direct binding
to L. lactis OppA
measured by fluorescence anisotropy. Bradykinin labeled with sulforhodamine
101 on the N-terminus (SR101-RPPGFSPFR) exhibited lower affinity for
OppA compared to bradykinin labeled on the C-terminus (RPPGFSPFRK-SR101).
The lines show the average fit for n = 3. Error bars
are stdev.

We next validated that the fluorescent
dye-labeled bradykinin-SR101
binds to the same site as unlabeled peptides using fluorescence anisotropy
competition assays (Figure 1). After optimizing assay conditions for sensitivity in our
system, we used a prebound complex of OppA and bradykinin-SR101 at
approximately 50% saturation and a half-max anisotropy in the absence
of the competitor peptide. Typically, 50–80% saturation provides
an excellent signal window because there is sufficient anisotropy
to be sensitive to probe displacement while avoiding experimental
uncertainty and signal dampening caused by complete saturation.44 In this competition assay, the addition of the
unlabeled competitor peptide results in a decrease in the anisotropy
when the OppA-bound dye-labeled peptide is displaced. As expected,
for peptides that bind to the same site, unlabeled bradykinin was
able to completely displace prebound bradykinin-SR101 (Figure 3). We additionally validated
that another reported high-affinity peptide derived from casein was
able to completely displace bradykinin-SR101. Furthermore, the low-affinity
peptide, neuropeptide S, was able to partially displace bradykinin-SR101
within the tested peptide concentration range, which was limited by
peptide solubility (Figure 3). Thus, our competition assays show that bradykinin-SR101
exhibits a normal mode of binding to OppA.

Figure 3 Competition binding to
OppA measured by fluorescence anisotropy
validates that bradykinin-SR101 binds to the canonical substrate binding
site. (A) Unlabeled competitor peptides are able to displace bradykinin-SR101.
The previously reported high-affinity bradykinin and a casein-derived
peptide are able to completely displace bradykinin-SR101. The previously
reported low-affinity peptide, neuropeptide S, partially displaces
bradykinin-SR101 because the dose–response was limited by our
peptide concentration range. (B) Related opioid peptides Leu-enkephalin,
dynorphin-A (1–9), and dynorphin-A (1–17) exhibit increasing
affinity with increasing length, respectively. The lines show the
average fit for n = 3. Error bars are stdev.

Interestingly, we were also able
to use our competition assay to
determine the relative affinities of leu-enkephalin and dynorphin
opioid peptides that have not been previously reported. Leu-enkephalin
(YGGFL) has been previously reported to bind OppA with low affinity,
which could not be quantified with gel shift or intrinsic protein
fluorescence assays.18,21,29 Using our fluorescence anisotropy assay, we found that leu-enkephalin
displaced bradykinin-SR101 with an IC50 ≈ 2 mM (Figure 3) (Table 1). Furthermore, dynorphin-A
(1–9) (YGGFLRRIR) exhibited an IC50 ≈ 34
μM, and dynorphin-A (1–17) (YGGFLRRIRPKLKWDNQ) exhibited
an IC50 ≈ 11 μM. The Cheng–Prusoff
equation is commonly used to convert the IC50 value to
the KD dissociation constant for the unlabeled
competitor.45 However, fluorescence anisotropy
competition assays often do not fulfill the assumptions made by the
Cheng–Prusoff equation.44,46,47 Therefore, we directly fitted the competition dose response data
to a three-state, two-ligand competition binding model to determine
the competitor affinities (Table 1, Supporting Discussion,
and Figures S4–S6).44,46,47 Our measured affinities for unlabeled bradykinin, the casein-derived
peptide, and leu-enkephalin showed excellent agreement with previously
reported values,21,29 validating our competition assay.

b Previously reported KD values from
the literature.

Previously,
it was reported that OppA optimally binds to nonapeptides,
but additional residues can contribute to increased affinity.21,23 Using our fluorescence anisotropy assay, we quantified the trend
in relative affinities for a series of closely related leu-enkephalin,
dynorphin-A (1–9), and dynorphin-A (1–17) peptides.
In particular, it is interesting that dynorphin-A (1–17) has
a significantly higher affinity for OppA relative to the shorter dynorphin-A
(1–9). This seems to indicate that OppA forms further favorable
contacts with the longer peptide sequence, which may be possible due
to the particularly voluminous binding cavity of OppA (∼4900
Å3) conferred by the third domain of this substrate-binding
protein.29

pH and Temperature Dependence
of OppA Peptide-Binding
Having established and validated
our fluorescence anisotropy assay,
we quantified how pH and temperature affect the peptide binding affinity
of OppA. We measured the direct binding of bradykinin-SR101 to OppA
at pH 5 to 8 at six different temperatures (18, 24, 30, 37, 45, and
55 °C) (Figure 4) (Table 2), and we
validated that unlabeled bradykinin could still bind and displace
bradykinin-SR101 under these conditions (Figure 5) (Table 3). OppA exhibits its highest peptide affinities for
the labeled bradykinin-SR101 under low-pH and low-temperature conditions.
The highest affinities were measured at pH 6 near its optimal growth
pH, and no further increase in affinity was observed at pH 5. In solution
at pH 6 and pH 7, increasing temperature causes a decrease in bradykinin-SR101
affinity. Interestingly, at pH 8, the measured peptide affinity did
not vary widely from 18 to 30 °C, and the lowest affinities measured
across the pH 5–8 range were in a similar concentration range
between 20 and 30 μM, suggesting a lower affinity limit within
this mesophilic range.

b Fitted KD values obtained by directly fitting competition
dose response data
to the competition binding model described in the Supporting Discussion.

c KD is
below the estimation limit for data fitted to the competition binding
model.

Our anisotropy competition
assays measured a similar trend in which
low pH and low temperature favored binding of the unlabeled bradykinin
to OppA (Figure 5)
(Table 3). As described
above, we directly fitted the competition dose response data to a
competition binding model to determine the KD values because the Cheng–Prusoff equation is not valid
here (Supporting Discussion, Figures S4–S6).
As expected, the measured affinities for unlabeled bradykinin were
approximately 10-fold higher relative to the labeled bradykinin-SR101.
However, similarities between the behavior of the two peptides indicate
that the presence of the SR101 dye itself does not obscure the pH
and temperature dependence of the binding equilibrium. We also note
that the IC50 values are insensitive to the pH-dependence
because of the inherent limitations of the IC50 parameter,
and the comparison of the IC50 and Kd values illustrates the importance of our fitting approach.
As discussed by Huang,44 the IC50 value is a nonlinear function of the peptide affinities, protein
concentration, and labeled peptide concentration. For any competitor
with much higher affinity relative to the labeled peptide affinity,
the IC50 approaches a lower bound and no longer correlates
with the Kd value. As expected, we observed
this effect in our system, which matches well with simulations reported
by Huang.44 Thus, our fitting approach
for the determination of Kd values is
critical.

Additionally, we observed protein aggregation and
precipitation
at higher temperatures (Figures 4 and 5) (Tables 2 and 3) (Figure S7). At pH 6, peptide binding was well-behaved
at temperatures from 18 to 45 °C, but aggregates were observed
at 55 °C that precluded measurement of fluorescence anisotropy.
At pH 7 and pH 8, the temperature threshold was lower, and protein
aggregation was observed at 45 °C and above. It is also possible
that aggregation that was not visible by eye caused the affinity measured
at pH 8 and 37 °C to be an outlier relative to lower temperatures
at pH 8 (Table 2).
These results clearly demonstrate that OppA function is disrupted
with increasing temperature, but low pH can increase resistance to
loss of binding. These observations match well with the lower pH and
temperature optimum for L. lactis growth.
One possible explanation for the loss of binding at high temperature
and high pH is that the OppA protein structure is less stable under
these conditions. Therefore, to complement our functional studies
using our fluorescence anisotropy assay, we next quantified thermal
stability at different pHs more precisely.

Low pH Increases OppA Thermal
Stability As Measured by CD
To determine if lower pH confers
structural stability and facilitates
peptide-binding function at high temperatures, we monitored the unfolding
transition and quantified the threshold melting temperature (Tm) by CD spectroscopy. The CD spectrum for OppA
shows an α-helical secondary structure signature with minima
at 208 and 222 nm, allowing us to monitor unfolding (Figure 6). Melting curves were measured
from the CD signal at 222 nm in the absence and presence of saturating
unlabeled bradykinin at pH 6, 7, and 8 (Figure 6). The melting temperature of OppA is higher
at lower pH, confirming our hypothesis that lower pH stabilizes the
structure of OppA. As expected, binding of bradykinin systematically
increases the melting temperature at each pH relative to apo-OppA,
and lower pH also increases the thermal stability of the peptide–protein
complex (Figure 6)
(Table 4). These data
show that the pH-dependent loss of protein stability could explain
the decrease in peptide binding to OppA under alkaline conditions
and high temperature, though this does not explain the pH-dependent
change in OppA affinity for peptides within the folded regime. Thus,
we next qualitatively investigated this using electrostatic surface
calculations.

Electrostatic Surface Potential at the OppA Peptide-Binding
Site
It is possible that a change in the electrostatic environment
of the binding site contributes to the pH-dependence of OppA peptide
affinity. The electrostatic surface charge of L. lactis OppA48 was calculated using PROPKA and
APBS49−52 at pH 6, 7, and 8 in the open state (Figure 7) and in the closed state (Figure S10). At pH 6, there is a neutralization of the exposed
surface area within the peptide-binding site compared to pH 7 and
pH 8, which could facilitate binding of hydrophobic and neutral peptides.
In contrast, Escherichia coli OppA,
which prefers positively charged peptides,53 exhibits less charge neutralization at pH 6 compared to pH 7 and
pH 8, maintaining significant negative surface charge within the peptide-binding
site. These observations provide a qualitative rationalization of
the pH-dependent effects on peptide binding. In the future, beyond
the scope of this technical study, the effects of charge changing
mutations of the OppA binding pocket and systematic sequence variation
of the peptide ligand could be measured using our fluorescence anisotropy
assay.

Discussion
The lactic acid bacteria L. lactis exhibits optimal growth at pH 6,34,35 and we have
discovered that acidic conditions promote the peptide binding function
of OppA that is necessary to support the auxotrophic metabolism of
this important species.

In this study, we developed and validated
a fluorescence anisotropy
peptide-binding assay to quantify relative pH-dependent differences
in affinity. In previous work, X-ray crystallography and isothermal
titration calorimetry have been extensively used to qualitatively
and quantitatively characterize binding function for OppA proteins
from different species.28,29,53−57 In addition, radioactivity, gel shift, and intrinsic protein fluorescence
methods have been used to measure dissociation constants and relative
affinities for a number of peptides,18,21,23,25,42 and solvatochromic dye-labeled peptides have been used to characterize
positional effects on OppA binding.22 Fluorescence
anisotropy has a number of practical advantages for measuring protein–ligand
interactions over these other methods,39−41 and for our study, it
offered an excellent signal and dynamic range. For example, we were
able to quantify the binding affinity of leu-enkephalin, which could
not be quantified by gel shift or intrinsic protein fluorescence because
its affinity to OppA is too low. Highlighting the versatility of our
assay, in addition to leu-enkephalin, we measured binding of two related
but not previously reported peptides, dynorphin-A (1–9) and
dynorphin-A (1–17). This series of peptides exhibited relative
affinities ranging from 2 mM to 11 μM, and our assay was sensitive
over at least 4-orders of magnitude in substrate concentrations over
which we could quantify interactions. To demonstrate that our fluorescence
anisotropy assay is broadly useful to study other peptide-binding
proteins, we also showed it can be used with the Bacillus
subtilis AppA protein (Figure S11) (Table S1).

Next, using
our fluorescence anisotropy assay, we discovered that
the L. lactis OppA peptide affinity
increases at acidic pH. We measured the highest affinity interaction
with the bradykinin-SR101 peptide at pH 6 and 18 °C, with affinities
ranging from 8.5 μM at 18 °C to 18 μM at 37 °C.
At the optimal growth temperature of 30 °C, we measured affinities
of 13, 19, and 22 μM at pH 6, 7, and 8, respectively, demonstrating
a decrease in binding affinity under neutral and alkaline conditions.
We also qualitatively observed a lower temperature threshold for protein
aggregation at pH 7 and 8 compared to pH 6. The loss of peptide binding
at high temperature and high pH suggested that the OppA protein could
be more thermally stable at low pH. In fact, CD spectroscopy clearly
showed that the melting temperature for the unfolding transition of
OppA was also decreased at pH 7 and 8 relative to pH 6. Both the anisotropy
and CD results are consistent with one another. Direct binding of
the labeled BK-SR101 peptide and competitive binding of the unlabeled
bradykinin peptide exhibit a decrease in affinity at higher temperatures
and higher pH. Thus, acidic conditions stabilize the OppA structure
and promote its ability to bind substrate peptides for import into
the bacteria.

The pH-dependence of OppA peptide binding within
the folded regime
also suggests that acidification could induce a classic change in
surface charge near or within the substrate-binding pocket. Supporting
this hypothesis, the electrostatic surface49−52 of the substrate binding pocket
showed a clear neutralization of negative surface charge at pH 6 relative
to pH 7 and 8. However, we observed a decrease in bradykinin affinity
with increasing pH, suggesting that an electrostatic interaction between
the negative surface of OppA and the arginine residues of bradykinin
is not the main binding determinant. We did observe that at pH 6,
there is a small patch of residual negative surface charge from residues
D134, D138, D455, E478, and D483. Thus, at all pH values studied,
there is some negative charge on OppA that could contribute to an
electrostatic interaction with the arginine residues, helping to explain
the high affinity for bradykinin. However, other binding factors may
contribute to a greater extent, which is consistent with the literature.
For example, Berntsson et al. demonstrated that a hydrophobic pocket
in OppA is a major binding determinant and in fact, the phenylalanine
residue of bradykinin binds to this hydrophobic pocket.31 Therefore, another interpretation could be that
the neutralization of surface charge at low pH promotes the development
of a hydrophobic environment to facilitate binding of bradykinin,
such as via interactions with the phenylalanine residue of bradykinin.
Alternatively, decreasing pH could promote a conformational change
that favors peptide binding, and this may be consistent with our CD
results that show an increase in global structural stability at lower
pH. In the future, a combination of systematic mutagenesis, structural
analysis, and functional analysis with our anisotropy assay can be
used to gain further insight into the binding mechanism of OppA.

Overall, this surface charge pattern also correlates well with
the previously reported partial preference of L. lactis OppA for hydrophobic and basic peptides and decreased use of negatively
charged acidic peptide substrates.18−25 In contrast, Klepsch et al.53 have shown
that the E. coli OppA prefers positively
charged peptide substrates, and they showed that there is an extensive
negative surface around the binding site at pH 7. We additionally
calculated the surface charge of E. coli OppA at pH 6 and 8 and found that substantial negative charge is
maintained over the entire pH range unlike L. lactis OppA. This observation might suggest that binding to E. coli OppA is pH-independent, which would be interesting
to study in the future along with other OppA proteins of interest
such as OppA from the Lyme disease culprit Borrelia
burgdorfei.58,59

There continues
to be a strong interest in understanding the fundamental
determinants of optimal growth and metabolism of L.
lactis because of its significant industrial and biomedical
potential.1,4,6−8,38,60,61 We focused our efforts studying the purified
OppA protein because it is the main determinant for peptide specificity
of the Opp transport complex, and in the future, it may be possible
to adapt our assay to study binding to the whole transport complex
reconstituted in liposomes.25 Our current
study suggests that the L. lactis OppA
protein is well-tuned to solution conditions experienced during optimal
growth, such as acidic pH and lowered temperature. It might also suggest
that direct molecular manipulation of OppA or other substrate-binding
proteins could be employed in strain engineering to adapt L. lactis to different metabolic conditions.42 Furthermore, future studies of the pH-dependent
structure and function of OppA from other species could provide similar
insights into the sporulation of B. subtilis or the virulence of B. burgdorfei, for example, in which an oligopeptide-binding protein is also a
critical aspect of auxotrophy.58,59,62,63 Overall, the fluorescence anisotropy
assay that we developed provides an easy and versatile method to quantify
the function of oligopeptide binding proteins in general.

Materials and
Methods
Reagents and Materials
Chemicals and media were purchased
from Fisher Scientific, Sigma, and Formedium. High-fidelity master
mix for Gibson Assembly was from New England Biolabs (Cat# M0492).
Bradykinin peptide (RPPGFSPFR) was purchased from and HPLC-purified
(98% purity) by Bachem. All other unlabeled peptides were custom-synthesized
and HPLC-purified (>95% purity) by GenScript. The sulforhodamine
101
labeled bradykinin peptides (SR101-RPPGFSPFR and RPPGFSPFRK-SR101)
were synthesized and HPLC-purified (>90% purity) by Anaspec.

Plasmid Construct
The L. lactis OppA amino acid sequence is from subspecies cremoris MG1363 (GenBank
accession AAO63470.1). The N-terminal signal peptide for palmitoylation
and surface tethering was removed similar to previous studies (Figure S1).21,22,29 The nucleotide sequence was optimized to minimize
hairpins for cloning and was synthesized as a gBlock by Integrated
DNA Technologies (IDT). The OppA gBlock was cloned into a pRSETB vector
by Gibson Assembly for bacterial expression and purification (Figure S2).

OppA Expression and Purification
The polyhistidine-tagged
protein was expressed in BL21(DE3) E. coli in Auto Induction Media (AIM) purchased from ForMedium (Cat# AIMLB0205).
Heterologous expression was used to avoid copurification with endogenous L. lactis peptides, and there was no evidence that
endogenous peptides interfered with any assays reported here. First,
single colonies were picked and used to inoculate 4 mL of Luria Broth
(LB) starter cultures. Starter cultures were grown overnight with
continuous shaking at 37 °C and then adjusted to an OD600 of
0.6 with LB. Large AIM cultures (250 mL) were inoculated with 2.5
mL of 0.6 OD600 LB starter cultures and grown at room temperature
(RT) for ∼65 h with continuous shaking at 160 rpm. Cultures
were pelleted at 1000g for 15 min and lyzed by sonication.
First, pellets were frozen at −80 °C and thawed at RT
twice. The pellets were resuspended in Tris buffer (50 mM Tris HCl,
300 mM NaCl, 10% v/v glycerol, 15 mM imidazole, pH 8.0) with 0.2 mg/mL
lysozyme, 0.1% v/v Triton X, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and
1 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) and rotated end-over-end at RT for 20 min.
The lysate was sonicated (QSonica, LLC model# Q125) on ice for 1 min
(pulse 2 s on with 2 s off, 80% amplitude) with 2 min rest, and sonication
was repeated two more times. The lysate was pelleted at 30 000g for 30 min, and the supernatant was filtered through a
0.45 μm low protein-binding Millex syringe filter, Durapore
(Cat# SLHV033NS). The protein was purified in Tris buffer by nickel
affinity chromatography using a GE Healthcare HiTrap IMAC HP column
(Cat# 45-000-163) loaded with 100 mM Ni2+ and eluted by
gradient with 15–500 mM imidazole on a GE Healthcare AKTA purifier.
The eluted protein was collected and dialyzed in sodium phosphate
buffer (25 mM sodium phosphate, 150 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, pH 7.0).
The dialyzed protein was concentrated to 1 mL with an EMD Millipore
Amicon Ultra centrifugal filter with 10 000 MWCO and purified
by size exclusion chromatography (SEC) on tandem GE Superdex 200 Increase
10/300 GL columns (product # 28990944, total bed volume = ∼48
mL) in sodium phosphate buffer. The concentration of the purified
protein was determined by absorbance at 280 nm using an extinction
coefficient of 99 140 M–1 cm–1 calculated using the Northwestern University Peptide Properties
Calculator (http://biotools.nubic.northwestern.edu/proteincalc.html#helpexco).

Fluorescence Anisotropy Assay
For direct dose response
binding, 100 μL of 1.5 μM dye-labeled bradykinin (SR101-RPPGFSPFR
or RPPGFSPFRK-SR101) was added to each well in a 96-well nonbinding
microplate (VWR, 89089-582). Purified OppA (50 μL) was added
to each well at final concentrations varying from 0.01 to 100 μM
and incubated at the desired temperature for at least 30 min to reach
equilibrium. Unless otherwise noted, all anisotropy assays were performed
at 30 °C in assay buffer (25 mM sodium phosphate, 150 mM NaCl,
10% glycerol, 1 mM DTT, 1× SIGMAFAST protease inhibitor cocktail,
0.05% v/v TWEEN, pH 6.0). The assay proved robust and adaptable to
different assay conditions, and protease inhibitors and detergent
did not interfere for example. For all protein assays, at least two
separately expressed and purified batches of OppA were used. Fluorescence
anisotropy was measured using a BioTek Synergy H4 microplate reader
with a Chroma 585 nm single-edge dichroic beamsplitter (T585Ipxr),
575/15 nm excitation filter, and 620/15 nm emission filter. For assays
performed at 18 and 24 °C, the microplate reader was moved into
a 4 °C cold room for constant cooling, while the instrument was
set to the desired temperature for heating.

For competition
dose response binding, a mixture of 1 μM bradykinin-SR101 and
15 μM OppA was prepared, and 150 μL of the mixture was
added to each well in a 96-well nonbinding microplate. The unlabeled
peptide (50 μL) was added to each well at final concentrations
varying from 0.1 to 2500 μM (1 to 10 000 μM for
leu-enkephalin) and incubated at the desired temperature for at least
1 h to reach equilibrium. Fluorescence anisotropy was measured as
described above.

Anisotropy (r) was calculated
using the intensity
of parallel (I∥) and perpendicular
(I⊥) light emitted as follows: . Anisotropy was plotted against
the log
concentration of protein for the direct dose response binding and
log concentration of the unlabeled peptide for competition dose response
binding. A dose response curve fit was performed in OriginPro to determine
the dissociation constant (KD) for direct
dose response data or the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) for competition data. The KD values for competition data were determined as described in the Supporting Information.

CD Spectroscopy
Pure OppA was diluted to 2 μM
in 25 mM sodium phosphate buffer (no NaCl or glycerol due to CD absorbance)
at the desired pH with or without 100 μM bradykinin. Diluted
protein (600 μL) was added to a quartz cuvette with a 2 mm path
length (Starna Cells, 18F-Q-10). CD absorbance was measured from 190
to 260 nm on a Jasco J-1500 CD spectrophotometer using a 50 nm/min
scan speed, 1.0 nm data pitch, 1.0 nm bandwidth, and 1 s digital integration
time.

Mean residue ellipticity ([θ]mrw) was
calculated as described in Kelly et al’s work.64 First, the mean residue weight (MRW) of OppA was calculated
using the following equation: , where M is the molar
mass of the protein in Da, N is the number of amino
acids in the protein, and the number of peptide bonds is N – 1. Here, our L. lactis OppA
molar mass is 66 419.5 Da and is composed of 601 amino acids
(Figure S2), which gives an MRW of 110.7
Da. Then, [θ]mrw was calculated using the following
equation:  where θλ is the
observed ellipticity in degrees, l is the pathlength
in cm, and c is the concentration in g/mL.

To measure thermal denaturation, the temperature was ramped from
4 to 74 °C (to 79 °C for OppA + bradykinin at pH 6), increasing
1°/min measuring the full spectrum every 5 °C with a 2 min
wait time before measurement for equilibration. The melting temperature
(Tm) was determined by plotting the mean
residue ellipticity at 222 nm against the temperature and fitting
to a Boltzmann distribution in OriginPro.
