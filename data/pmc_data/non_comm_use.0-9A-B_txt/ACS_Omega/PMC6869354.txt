Considering the environmental
problems caused by a large amount
of cotton textile waste and its possible applications in flexible
electrodes, it is very promising to reuse the cotton textile waste
as an electrode material, reducing the cost of flexible electrodes
and alleviating environmental problems. In this work, we present a
rechargeable flexible Zn–air battery based on cotton textile
waste, which employs Ni-metallized cotton textile waste (NMCTW) as
a flexible substrate for Zn anodes and air cathodes. The transparent
NiFe hydroxide thin film horizontally grown on the surface of the
NMCTW substrate was synthesized in situ by the electrodeposition method,
which exhibits excellent catalytic activity because of the high surface
area of the two-dimensional (2D) thin film, large contact area between
the thin film and substrate, and fast charge transport of the 2D thin-film
structure. In view of the high catalytic performance of the NiFe hydroxide
thin film, it was used as the catalytic material of the air cathode
for the flexible Zn–air battery. The assembled Zn–air
battery based on cotton textile waste demonstrated a good rate performance
and outstanding charge and discharge cycling stability. The assembled
Zn–air battery was applied to power the light-emitting diode,
which exhibits exceptional flexibility and stable output power even
under severe mechanical bending deformation, proving the feasibility
for its application in flexible electronics.

1 Introduction
Flexible electronics have attracted tremendous research interest
in recent years owing to their distinguished advantages such as portability,
lightweight, flexibility, and potentially wearability.1−9 They offer various novel applications for wearable devices, such
as flexible bracelets, smartphones, and humanlike display skins.10−13 To achieve the flexibility of an integrated electronic system, well-matched
flexible power supplies are recognized as one of the key components.1,14 Meanwhile, taking into account the increasing need for continuous
power supplies for electronic devices, it is also imperative to develop
high energy density storage/conversion devices. Therefore, it is highly
urgent to develop a flexible power source with high energy density.

To date, a large number of energy storage/conversion systems have
been studied, such as solar cells,15−19 fuel cells,20−24 supercapacitors,25−31 lithium-ion batteries,32−36 and metal–air batteries.37−42 Among them, metal–air batteries possess high theoretical
energy densities, being regarded as the promising candidates as power
suppliers for next-generation flexible electronics.2,6,43,44 Especially,
Zn–air batteries are gaining ever-growing attention owing to
their low price, good safety, environmental benignity, and resource
richenss.2,6,7,45 Theoretically, a Zn–air battery has a high
energy density (1084 W h kg–1) that is about 3–5
times higher than the traditional lithium-ion battery.8,44,46−48 Nevertheless,
typical Zn–air batteries are usually not suitable for wearable
and flexible electronics because of their rigid configuration. Zn–air
batteries usually consist of an electrolyte, a separator, and Zn anodes
and air cathodes. As the key components, flexible electrodes are particularly
important for achieving high-performance flexible Zn–air batteries.

Until now, considerable efforts have been devoted to the high-performance
flexible electrode materials, such as metal materials,49,50 polymers,51,52 metal oxides/nitrides/sulfides,13,53,54 and carbon materials.13,32−34,55 Especially, carbon
materials such as carbon nanotubes, graphene papers, carbon cloth,
carbon fibers, and carbon films have been receiving extensive attention
because of their good mechanical robustness, higher power density,
long-lasting cycle, and good electrical conductivity.10,13,55−58 For instance, Fu et al.59 fabricated the CoO0.87S0.13/nitrogen-doped graphene nanomesh hybrid as the air cathode catalyst
in Zn–air batteries, and the electrode exhibited comparable
catalytic activity and excellent stability than the commercial Ir/C
and Pt/C. Xu et al.11 synthesized the porous
carbon nanotube sheet electrode by chemical vapor deposition, which
demonstrated outstanding charge/discharge properties at 2 A g–1. However, expensive carbon nanotubes or graphene
used to construct flexible electrodes will increase the cost of the
device, hampering the commercial application. On the other hand, a
large amount of cotton textile waste has been generated because of
the increase in cotton textile consumption in recent decades.60,61 Generally, cotton textile waste is landfilled or incinerated, resulting
in serious environmental problems.62,63 If the cotton
textile waste is used as a flexible electrode substrate, it can turn
waste into treasure, reducing the cost of flexible electrode materials
and alleviating environmental problems. To date, there has been no
report on fabricating flexible electrodes for wearable and flexible
Zn–air batteries based on cotton textile waste. Therefore,
it is highly desirable to develop a new strategy to prepare flexible
electrodes based on cotton textile waste and explore their electrochemical
performance toward practical flexible applications.

Herein,
we demonstrate a novel flexible Zn–air battery employing
the Ni-metallized cotton textile waste (NMCTW) as a flexible substrate
for Zn anode- and air cathode-active materials. The binder-free flexible
electrodes are obtained by directly electrodepositing the Zn metal
and NiFe hydroxide thin-film catalyst on NMCTW. The as-obtained flexible
electrode with NiFe hydroxide thin-film catalyst exhibits excellent
mechanical strength/flexibility, good rate capability, and good cycling
stability. The assembled flexible Zn–air battery demonstrates
practical flexible application and exhibits excellent mechanical flexibility
and electrochemical performance even under severe deformation conditions,
opening up unprecedented opportunities for constructing a next-generation
high-performance flexible power source toward flexible and wearable
electronics.

2 Results and Discussion
Figure 1 shows the
fabrication procedure of a Zn-coated electrode and a NiFe hydroxide
electrode. First, the cleaned cotton textile waste was metallized
by Ni electroless deposition, and the color of the cleaned cotton
textile waste changes from white to silver gray with metallic luster
(observed from the optical photographs in Figure 1), indicating the deposition of Ni on the
cotton textile waste. Next, the Zn-coated cotton textile waste electrode
with silver white color and the NiFe hydroxide electrode with deep
silver gray color were successfully fabricated through Zn electrodeposition
and NiFe hydroxide electrodeposition based on the as-obtained NMCTW,
respectively. In addition, both Zn-plated cotton textile waste and
NiFe hydroxide electrode possess high flexibility, and the Zn deposition
layers and NiFe hydroxide have strong adhesion to cotton textile waste
even under mechanical deformation (Figure 1) and vigorous sonication. This would be
beneficial to realize a Zn–air battery with high flexibility
and mechanical strength.

Figure 1 Fabrication procedures of the Zn-coated electrode
and NiFe hydroxide
electrode.

Figure 2 shows the
scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image and energy-dispersive spectroscopy
(EDS) spectrum of NMCTW. It can be seen that the cotton textile waste
is uniformly covered by Ni after the deposition (Figure 2a). The EDS mapping of Ni element
further indicates the presence of metallic Ni particles. The Ni particles
evenly dispersed on the surface of the cotton textiles waste substrate
(Figure 2b–d)
act as a flexible conductive electrode substrate.

spectrum, (c) enlarged SEM images, and (d)
corresponding elemental mapping of NMCTW.

Figure 3 shows the
SEM and EDS results of Zn-plated cotton textile waste. It can be observed
that the Ni deposition layer is uniformly covered by Zn. Simultaneously,
the Zn-plated cotton textile waste still maintains its fabric characteristics
(Figure 3a). The EDS
elemental mapping of Zn-coated cotton textile waste shows that only
Zn metal element is detected, suggesting that Ni metal is completely
covered by the thick Zn layer (Figure 3b–d).

SEM images, and (d)
corresponding elemental mapping of Zn-plated cotton textile waste.

Figure 4 shows the
SEM images of the surface morphology of NiFe hydroxides prepared at
−0.95 V [vs saturated calomel electrode (SCE)] for different
electrodeposition times. When the electrodeposition time is 250 s,
a small amount of NiFe hydroxides sporadically grow on the surface
of NMCTW, exhibiting nanocluster structure (Figure 4a,b). As the electrodeposition time increases
to 500 s, more NiFe hydroxides are uniformly formed on the surface
(Figure 4c). The magnified
views of NiFe hydroxides show that nearly transparent NiFe hydroxide
thin films are horizontally grown on the surface. Some small wrinkles
were also observed on the surface (Figure 4d), which is a typical feature of NiFe hydroxides64−66 and has been reported in our previous studies on electrodeposited
NiFe hydroxides.67 The formation of such
wrinkles is related to the presence of flexible and thin-layered double
hydroxides.68 As the electrodeposition
time further increases to 1000 s, a thick porous NiFe hydroxide layer
is formed on the surface of NMCTW (Figure 4f), and some NiFe hydroxides are detached
because of very thick deposits (Figure 4e), which may cause poor catalytic performance. Among
the as-obtained NiFe hydroxides with various surface morphologies,
the two-dimensional (2D) thin-film structure possesses good flexibility,
which can alleviate the battery surface stress under mechanical bending.3 This feature is very beneficial for electrode
materials of flexible batteries.

Figure 4 SEM images of the surface morphology of
NiFe hydroxides prepared
at −0.95 V (vs SCE) for different electrodeposition times of
(a) 250, (c) 500, and (e) 1000 s. (b,d,f) are the magnified views
of (a,c,e), respectively.

To gain insights into the elemental composition distribution and
structural information of the as-obtained NiFe hydroxide thin-film
electrode, EDS mapping and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis were performed.
As shown in Figure 5a, the EDS mapping of NiFe hydroxide thin film displays a homogeneous
distribution of Ni, Fe, and O elements, implying the uniform growth
and high dispersion of NiFe hydroxides on NMCTW. In the XRD pattern
of hydroxide thin-film electrode (Figure 5b), the peaks at around 44° and 52°
are assigned to the coated Ni.69 The peaks
at approximately 18°, 26°, and 48° are related to the
diffraction from cotton textile waste.70 The peaks labeled (003), (006), (012), and (110) are well consistent
with literature data for NiFe hydroxides (JCPDS card 51-0463),71−73 indicating the formation of NiFe hydroxides.

XRD of the NiFe hydroxide thin-film electrode
electrodeposited at −0.95 V (vs SCE) for 500 s.

To assess the electrocatalytic property of the as-obtained
NiFe
hydroxides, the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution
reaction (OER) of the as-obtained NiFe hydroxides with different surface
morphologies were tested in O2-saturated 0.1 M KOH aqueous
solution by linear sweep voltammetry. As shown in Figure 6a, the current density of ORR
observed at −0.8 V (vs SCE) for NiFe hydroxide thin films is
1.77 mA cm–2, which is distinctly higher than those
of NiFe hydroxide nanoclusters (0.17 mA cm–2) and
thick porous NiFe hydroxide (0.51 mA cm–2) (Figure 6a), illustrating
the better ORR catalytic activity of NiFe hydroxide thin films. A
similar trend is also observed in Figure 6b for OER catalytic activity of as-obtained
NiFe hydroxides. The NiFe hydroxide thin-film electrode exhibits the
highest OER current density of 14.62 mA cm–2 at
0.8 V (vs SCE), which is 8.7–32.5 times higher than those of
the NiFe hydroxide nanoclusters (0.45 mA cm–2) and
thick porous NiFe hydroxide (1.65 mA cm–2), indicating
the superior OER catalytic activity of the NiFe hydroxide thin-film
electrode. Obviously, the NiFe hydroxide thin-film electrode possesses
the better ORR and OER catalytic activities. The origin of the better
ORR and OER catalytic activities for the NiFe hydroxide thin-film
electrode could be mainly attributed to the thin-film structure effect
and good conductivity.67,74 On the one hand, the as-obtained
NiFe hydroxide possesses 2D thin-film structure (Figure 4b). This structure has large
surface area and high percentage of coordinated unsaturated surface
atoms, which could provide a large number of catalytic active sites
for the ORR and OER.75−78 In contrast, the NiFe hydroxide nanocluster electrode has small
amount of NiFe hydroxides grown sporadically on the surface of NMCTW
(Figure 4b), which
results in the fewer active sites for the ORR and OER catalytic activity.
On the other hand, because NiFe hydroxide thin films are horizontally
grown on the surface of NMCTW substrate (Figure 4b), the NiFe hydroxide thin-film electrode
has a large contact area between the NiFe hydroxide thin film and
the NMCTW substrate. This will lead to the low interface resistance
and thus facilitate catalytic performance, which has also been reported
in our previous work.67 Besides, the fast
charge transport of 2D thin-film structure is also the key to enhance
the ORR/OER kinetics during catalytic reactions. Compared to NiFe
hydroxide thin-film electrode, the thick porous NiFe hydroxide electrode
has the poor conductivity because of its large thickness, which has
a negative effect on the ORR/OER catalytic performance.74

Figure 6 Curves of (a) ORR and (b) OER of the as-obtained NiFe
hydroxides
with different surface morphologies.

Apart from better ORR/OER catalytic performance, NiFe hydroxide
thin films could accommodate the mechanical deformation of the cell,
which makes them suitable for the practical application in flexible
Zn–air batteries. In the following battery test, the as-obtained
NiFe hydroxide thin-film electrode is used to assemble the flexible
Zn–air batteries based on cotton textile waste. Figure 7a shows the cross-sectional
SEM image of the assembled Zn–air batteries based on cotton
textile waste. The configuration of the battery presents a sandwich
structure, including a NiFe hydroxide air electrode layer, a Zn-coated
electrode layer, and a hydrogel electrolyte layer (Figure 7a). To investigate the galvanostatic
discharge performance of the assembled Zn–air batteries based
on cotton textile waste, the discharge curves at different current
densities were measured. As shown in Figure 7b, as the discharge current density was gradually
increased from 0.2 to 3.0 mA cm–2, the discharge
voltage plateaus change from 1.25 to 0.68 V, indicating that the battery
can work at a relatively wide range of discharge current densities. Figure 7c shows the galvanostatic
discharge curve at 1 mA cm–2. Clearly, the galvanostatic
discharge voltage plateaus of the battery decrease slightly from 0.94
to 0.87 V and last for 4.6 h during the discharge process, indicating
good discharge stability. The voltage decreases sharply at the end
of discharge, demonstrating the discharge failure of the battery.
The reactions occurring on the Zn electrode during the discharge can
be expressed as follows43 1   2  

Figure 7 (a) Cross-sectional SEM image and galvanostatic
discharge curves
of the assembled Zn–air battery with 1 cm2 at (b)
different current densities and (c) 1 mA cm–2.

On the one hand, the consumption of OH– in the
electrolyte and the formation of the insoluble ZnO on the surface
of electrolyte will lead to an increase in resistance of battery and
finally cause the discharge failure of the Zn–air battery.
On the other hand, the excessive consumption of the Zn electrode may
result in the end of the discharge of the Zn–air battery.3,8 The gravimetric energy density calculated was 547 W h kg–1, which is close to the reported value of the Zn–air battery
in the previous literature.8

To investigate
the discharge/charge cycling performance, the continuous
galvanostatic discharge/charge was tested at 1 mA cm–2 with the cycle period of 20 min of discharge and then 20 min of
charge. As shown in Figure 8a, the assembled Zn–air battery based on cotton textile
waste demonstrates excellent stability without the significant potential
change during the whole testing period, evidencing good stability
of charge and discharge process of the assembled Zn–air battery
based on cotton textile waste. The assembled battery exhibits the
discharge and charge potential of approximately 0.94 and 1.99 V at
1 mA cm–2, respectively. The potential gap between
charge and discharge was about 1.05 V, which is close to that (1.1
V) of commercial Pt/C- and Ir/C-mixed catalyst-based rechargeable
Zn–air batteries,79 implying the
good catalytic activity of NiFe hydroxide. In addition, the failure
time of the Zn–air battery during the cycling test can be observed,
about 8 h, displaying a long cycle life. Figure 8b shows the discharge stability of the prototype
of the assembled Zn–air battery based on cotton textile waste
under different mechanical bending deformation angles. It can be seen
that the assembled Zn–air battery based on cotton textile waste
was mechanically bent to different angles ranging from 0° to
180°, and no significant loss in the discharge performance was
observed, demonstrating exceptional flexibility and good discharge
stability of the assembled Zn–air batteries based on cotton
textile waste.

To explore the potential application, a demonstration
of the red
light-emitting diode (LED) powered by the assembled flexible Zn–air
batteries based on cotton textile waste was conducted. As shown in Figure 9a, three flexible
Zn–air batteries based on cotton textile waste connected in
series can light a red LED. Even when assembled flexible Zn–air
batteries were mechanically bent to a small angle of 45° (Figure 9b) or extremely folded
to 0° (Figure 9c), it could still power the red LED, indicating the stable power
output and considerable flexibility of the Zn–air batteries
based on cotton textile waste.

assembled flexible Zn–air
batteries based on cotton textile waste mechanically bent into different

3 Conclusions
In summary, for the first time,
we report a novel and flexible
rechargeable Zn–air battery based on cotton textile waste,
which employs NMCTW as a flexible substrate for Zn anode- and air
cathode-active materials, respectively. The binder-free flexible electrode
with a transparent NiFe hydroxide thin film horizontally grown on
the surface of NMCTW substrate was successfully synthesized, exhibiting
excellent mechanical strength/flexibility and good catalytic activity.
The assembled Zn–air batteries based on cotton textile waste
display a good rate capability and an outstanding charge and discharge
cycling stability. In practical applications of powering for LED,
the cotton textile waste-based Zn–air batteries show exceptional
flexibility and stable output power, even under extreme mechanical
bending conditions.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Synthesis and Characterization of Electrodes
Based on Cotton Textile Waste
The cotton textile waste is
from waste lab coat, which was ultrasonically cleaned in acetone for
15 min and repeatedly rinsed with deionized water, and then dried
by argon gas flow. The Ni-coated cotton textiles were fabricated following
the procedure. First of all, the cotton textile waste was immersed
in 37% HCl solution containing 53 mM SnCl2 for 20 min at
room temperature. The as-obtained textile was then dipped in 0.5 g
L–1 of PdCl2 + 20 mL L–1 37% HCl aqueous solution for activation. Next, the activated cotton
textile waste was immersed into the mixture solution of 0.34 M NH4Cl + 27 mM C6H5Na3O7·2H2O + 97 mM NiSO4 + 0.14 M NaH2PO2·H2O for electroless plating of Ni.
Finally, the as-obtained Ni-plated cotton textile waste was rinsed
with distilled water to remove the residual plating solution and dried
at 50 °C for 30 min. On the basis of the as-obtained NMCTW, the
Zn-coated anode were prepared by electroplating at the current density
of 30 mA cm–2 for 30 min in an aqueous solution
of 250 g L–1 of ZnSO4·7H2O + 30 g L–1 Na2SO4 + 5 g
L–1 Al2(SO4)3,
and the air electrode with NiFe hydroxide catalyst was prepared by
electrochemical deposition at −0.95 V (vs SCE) for 250, 500,
and 1000 s, respectively, in an aqueous solution of 3 mM Ni(NO3)2 + 3 mM Fe(NO3)3.

The surface morphology and composition of the as-obtained Zn anode
and the air electrode with nickel iron hydroxide catalyst were characterized
by a scanning electron microscope (S-4800, Hitachi, Japan) equipped
with an X-ray EDS system. The crystalline structures of the as-obtained
electrodes were measured by XRD (Cu Kα radiation, D/max 2200/PC,
Rigaku, Japan).

4.2 Electrochemical Tests
Electrochemical
tests were conducted in a three-electrode cell configuration using
the electrochemical workstation (CHI 760E, Shanghai Chenhua, China).
A Pt plate and an SCE acted as the counter electrode and reference
electrode, respectively. The NMCTW electrodes covered with a NiFe
hydroxide catalyst were directly used as the working electrode in
the absence of a binder and/or a conductivity promoter. The catalytic
performance of NiFe hydroxide was evaluated by linear sweep voltammetry
in O2-saturated 0.1 M KOH aqueous solution at 5 mV s–1.

4.3 Assembly and Tests of the
Cotton Textile Waste-Based
Flexible Zn–Air Battery
The sandwich-structured flexible
Zn–air battery device was assembled with the flexible electrodes
of the Zn-plated cotton textile waste and the NiFe hydroxide face-to-face
separated by the poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA)–KOH alkaline polymer
electrolyte. The electrolyte was fabricated following the procedure:80 1.6 g of PVA was first dissolved in 16 mL of
distilled water under continuous stirring at 85 °C for about
90 min, until a clear viscous solution was obtained. Subsequently,
4 mL of aqueous solution containing 2 g of KOH solution was slowly
dropped into the viscous solution under continuous stirring for approximately
30 min, until the viscous solution became clear. A thin KOH–PVA
film hydrogel electrolyte was prepared by cross-linking at −8
°C for 2 h in a Petri dish. The KOH–PVA film of the sandwich-structured
flexible Zn–air battery acted as both the separator and electrolyte.

A multichannel battery testing system (LAND CT2001A, Wuhan, China)
was used to test the galvanostatic discharge and the discharge/charge
cycling of the cotton textile waste-based flexible Zn–air battery.
Galvanostatic discharge test was performed at different discharge
current densities. The discharge/charge performance test was carried
out, in which each cycle consists of 20 min of discharge, followed
by 20 min of charge. The energy density was calculated according to
the following equation:  where the mass of consumed Zn electrode is
11.6 mg. All of the tests were carried out under ambient atmosphere
condition.
