The micellar solution and the lyotropic
liquid crystalline phases
formed by gemini surfactants containing morpholinium headgroups are
investigated for their self-aggregation and physicochemical properties
in water. These gemini surfactants demonstrated good surface activity
because they are able to undergo micellization at lower concentration
and form nanosized micellar aggregates in dilute aqueous solution.
The binary mixture of the morpholinium gemini surfactant–water
system is investigated over a wide range of concentrations. The micellar
solution of the morpholinium gemini surfactants demonstrated Newtonian
fluidlike behavior between 10 and 50 wt % as the observed viscosities
were independent of the applied shear rate. At higher concentration,
morpholinium geminis formed self-assembled lyotropic phases in water.
These liquid crystalline phases were characterized by small-angle
X-ray scattering and polarized optical microscopy techniques.

1 Introduction
Gemini
surfactants are being increasingly investigated for various
applications ranging from materials science to biomedical sciences.1 These surfactants demonstrate superior physicochemical
properties compared to monomeric surfactants and are able to self-aggregate
into micelles at relatively lower concentration compared to their
monomeric analogues.1 Cationic geminis
are an important category of surfactants containing two positively
charged headgroups and two hydrophobic tails often connected by a
spacer.2 These surfactants are able to
interact with a wide variety of molecules and materials in nature
and possess unique characteristics.3 They
are able to interact with a wide range of biomolecules/bioactive molecules
such as peptides,4 proteins,5,6 drugs,7 and nucleic acids8 and often find applications as a drug delivery agent, nonviral
gene delivery vectors, and an antifungal and antimicrobial agent.9,10 Because of their ability to self-aggregate in water, they are used
as a soft template for the synthesis of hollow inorganic materials11 and for the stabilization of microemulsions.12 In recent years, several functionalized derivatives
of these cationic gemini surfactants have been developed, containing
different types of cationic headgroups. Among the various structural
derivatives of these gemini surfactants, the conventional bisquaternary
ammonium2 is widely investigated along
with the heterocyclic headgroup containing gemini cationic surfactants,
that is, pyridinium,13−16 imidazolium,17−21 pyrrolidinium,22−25 and piperidinium.26,27 Morpholonium gemini surfactant
is another important category of heterocyclic cationic gemini surfactants.28,29 Recent reports have established their effectiveness as a corrosion
inhibitor30 and a drug-solubilizing agent.31 These surfactants are unique compared to other
categories of cationic gemini surfactants. In our previous studies,
while investigating gemini surfactants with different headgroups,
we found that the gemini surfactant with the morpholinium headgroup
possesses unique physicochemical characteristics combined with the
exceptional water solubility at low temperature and high surfactant
concentration.28 Unlike other conventional
gemini surfactants, these morpholinium geminis are capable of forming
hydrogen bonding with water because of the presence of pairs of nonbonding
electrons on the O atom present in morpholinium headgroups. Thus,
the polar morpholinium headgroups capable of forming hydrogen bonds
with water are able to get solubilized at relatively lower temperature
in water. Further, self-aggregation and micellization properties of
only limited structural varieties of morpholinium geminis are reported
in the literature,28,31 and there is limited information
about their phase and rheological behaviors. This prompted us to further
investigate new structural derivatives of morpholinium gemini surfactants
in detail. In the present paper, we have synthesized new ester-functionalized
morpholinium gemini surfactants via a two-step synthetic process and
characterized these new gemini surfactants by spectroscopic techniques.
These gemini surfactants were investigated for their self-aggregation
properties by surface tension, conductivity method, and dynamic light
scattering (DLS) method. Further, the concentration-dependent viscosity
behavior of these surfactants was investigated in aqueous solution.
These surfactants were able to form lyotropic liquid crystalline phases
at higher concentration, which was investigated by small-angle X-ray
scattering (SAXS) and polarized optical microscopy (POM) techniques.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Characterization of Morpholinium
Gemini Surfactants
Two different types of morpholinium gemini
surfactants containing
12-hydrocarbon tail—4,4′-(hexane-1,6-diylbis(oxy))bis(2-oxoethane-1,2-diyl)bis(4-dodecylmorpholin-4-ium)
dibromide ([C12MOR(6)C12MOR]2Br) and 14-hydrocarbon tail—4,4′-(hexane-1,6-diylbis(oxy))bis(2-oxoethane-1,2-diyl)bis(4-tetradecylmorpholin-4-ium)
dibromide ([C14MOR(6)C14MOR]2Br) (Figure 1) were synthesized.

Figure 1 Molecular structure of
morpholinium gemini surfactants synthesized
and investigated.

The molecular structure
of the morpholinium gemini surfactants
was confirmed by 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy
and high-resolution mass spectroscopy (HRMS). The 1H NMR
spectra for the surfactants confirmed total 82 protons for [C12MOR(6)C12MOR]2Br
and 90 protons for [C14MOR(6)C14MOR]2Br. Each individual proton signal
was assigned based on confirmation by 2D heteronuclear chemical shift
correlation and 2D correlation spectroscopy experiments. The signal
for methylene protons present between ester functionality and positively
charged nitrogen of the morpholinium headgroup (−COOCH2N+) was observed
as a singlet between δ 5.33 and 5.38 ppm for the morpholinium
gemini surfactants. The protons adjacent to the positively charged
nitrogen which are part of the heterocyclic ring are diastereotopic
in nature and were observed as two independent signals at δ
4.47–4.53 ppm for −CHaHbN+CHaHb– and at δ 3.80–3.84 ppm for
−CHaHbN+CHaHb–. The latter signals were observed along with the protons
directly attached to the quaternary nitrogen, which are part of the
hydrophobic alkyl chain length (−CH2CH2N+). The methylene protons
of the heterocyclic headgroup adjacent to the oxygen atom are also
diastereotopic in nature and were observed as two independent signals
at δ 4.34–4.36 ppm for −CHaHbOCHaHb– and at δ 3.97–4.02
ppm for −CHaHbN+CHaHb–. The signals for the methylene protons adjacent to
ester functionality which are part of spacer units were observed as
triplet at δ 4.26 ppm, whereas the signals for the other methylene
protons of spacer units were observed between δ 1.52 and 1.72
ppm. In 13C NMR spectra, the characteristic signals for
the carbonyl carbon of the ester group were observed at δ 164.38
ppm for [C12MOR(6)C12MOR]2Br and at 164.31 ppm for [C14MOR(6)C14MOR]2Br.
The molecular structure of the morpholinium gemini surfactants was
further confirmed by the HRMS. The observed values for the parent
ion peak for both surfactant molecules closely matched with the calculated
values. The purity of both the new surfactants was confirmed by the
elemental analysis.

2.2 Surface Tension Measurements
The
surfactant properties of the morpholinium gemini surfactants were
determined by surface tension measurements. The length of the hydrophobic
tail influences the surface properties of these surfactants. The critical
micelle concentration (cmc) values of these surfactants decrease with
increase in hydrophobic alkyl chain length (Table 1). Figure 2 shows the surface tension versus log of concentration
plot of [C12MOR(6)C12MOR]2Br and [C14MOR(6)C14MOR]2Br at 25 °C.

b cmc determined by

The cmc values of
these ester-functionalized morpholinium geminis
are lower compared to their structural analogue with a short spacer
unit28 and conventional quaternary ammonium
gemini surfactants having a similar hydrophobic tail and spacer units.32,33 The cmc values of these surfactants are closely related to those
of recently reported nonfunctionalized morpholinium gemini surfactants28,31 and other types of heterocyclic cationic gemini surfactants,22,34−36 when compared with surfactants with an equivalent
number of the hydrophobic carbon tail.

The affinity to reduce
surface tension at cmc (γcmc) by this group of surfactants
significantly varies with increase
in hydrophobic alkyl chain length. The γcmc values
of the new gemini morpholinium surfactants [C12MOR(6)C12MOR]2Br and
[C14MOR(6)C14MOR]2Br are comparatively lower compared to those of
previously reported gemini morpholinium surfactants.28,31 Generally, the γcmc values decrease with increase
in hydrophobic alkyl tail length for the conventional surfactants.37 However, the γcmc values observed
for the ester-functionalized gemini morpholinium surfactants increase
with increase in hydrophobic alkyl chain length, and consequently,
the gemini surfactant with longer hydrophobic tail (14 carbon) demonstrates
less efficiency in reducing the surface tension of water compared
to its analogue with smaller hydrocarbon tail (12 carbon). Recent
report suggests that the unconventional diversely functionalized gemini
surfactants containing polar ester,26 amide,38 and hydroxyl39 groups
behave differently, and the affinity to reduce surface tension generally
decreases with increase in hydrophobic alkyl chain length for these
groups of gemini surfactants. Similar trend has been reported for
the amide-functionalized cationic surfactants containing morpholinium
headgroups as the affinity to reduce surface tension drastically decreases
with increase in hydrophobic alkyl chain length.40 Li et al. have recently investigated and explained the
observed trend of increasing γcmc and Amin values with increasing hydrophobic alkyl chain length
for gemini surfactants based on the detailed analysis by neutron reflectometry.41 The investigation suggests that the anomalous
behavior for the observed surface tension trend for gemini surfactants
is probably due to poor packing of the gemini side chains between
adjacent molecules. The longer the side chain, the more they interfere
with each other and thus are less effective in reducing the surface
tension at the air–water interface.41 Recent report on quaternary ammonium gemini surfactants containing
multiple polar functional groups has also confirmed the affinity of
these surfactants to form hydrogen bonding in aqueous solution. The
observed γcmc trend for the new ester-functionalized
gemini morpholinium surfactants is in accordance with the trend observed
for the functionalized gemini surfactants containing polar functional
groups and may also be attributed to the affinity of these types of
gemini surfactants to form a hydrogen-bonding network in water.42 Such types of interactions combined with poor
packing of gemini side chains may significantly influence the overall
dynamics of the system, thereby affecting the self-aggregation and
physicochemical properties.

The maximum surface excess concentration
at the air–water
interface, Γmax, is calculated by applying the Gibbs
adsorption isotherm equation 1  where γ denotes the surface tension, R is
the gas constant, T is the absolute
temperature, and C is the surfactant concentration. n is a constant which depends on the number of species constituting
the surfactant which are adsorbed at the air–water interface.
The value of n for gemini surfactants is generally
considered to be 3. However, recent investigation has shown that the
use of n = 3 in eq 1 can lead to area per molecule that is unrealistically
large relative to the molecular size and high surface activity of
the geminis.41,43 Neutron reflectometry studies41 and surface potential43 have shown that n is a variable depending upon
the hydrophobic alkyl chain length. We in the current studies have
calculated the values of Γmax and Amin, considering n to be 2 and 3.32,44 The area occupied per surfactant molecule (Amin) at the air–water interface is obtained by using
the following equation 2  where N is Avogadro’s
number and Amin is in square nanometer.
The values of Γmax and Amin are shown in Table 1. The Amin values of the morpholinium
gemini surfactant increase with the increase in hydrophobic alkyl
tail length. Generally, the Amin value
decreases with increase in hydrophobic alkyl chain length for conventional
monomeric quaternary ammonium surfactants.41 However, anomalous behavior is evident for gemini surfactants as
they demonstrate the ability to form premicellar aggregates.44 As the electrical conductance varies with increasing
surfactant concentration, the molar conductivity when plotted against
√C gives significant information about the
presence of the existence of premicellar aggregates in the surfactant
solution. Such plot shows a small upward curvature or a maximum if
the premicellar aggregates are formed in solution because the equivalent
conductivity of small aggregates is larger than the sum of the equivalent
conductivities of the ions constituting it.44 The plot of molar conductivity versus √C for the gemini morpholinium surfactant indicates the absence of
premicellar aggregates for [C12MOR(6)C12MOR]2Br containing 12-carbon
hydrophobic tail, as the maximum is absent in this case (see Figure
S5, Supporting Information). However, the
gemini morpholinium surfactant [C14MOR(6)C14MOR]2Br containing 14-carbon
tail demonstrated some peculiarities at lower concentration, and maximum
is observed confirming the existence of premicellar aggregates in
the surfactant solution (see Figure S6, Supporting Information). Hence, [C14MOR(6)C14MOR]2Br has lower Amin value compared to [C12MOR(6)C12MOR]2Br.
The observed trend for Amin values is
also supported by the fact that the gemini surfactants containing
longer hydrophobic alkyl chain demonstrate poor packing at the air–water
interface.41 The in-depth analysis of gemini
surfactants by neutron reflectometry studies has recently established
that the gemini surfactants containing longer hydrocarbon tail demonstrate
poor packing of the gemini side chains between adjacent molecules.41

2.3 Conductivity Measurements
The micellar
solution of morpholinium gemini surfactants was further evaluated
by conductivity measurements. The classical method adopted to determine
the cmc values from conductivity data involves intersecting the lines
fitted in the diluted and concentrated regions before and after the
cmc. This method gives independence in selection of the point denoting
cmc value, and hence, notable errors can occur in determining the
cmc values. To overcome this limitation, we adopted a mathematical
procedure proposed by Carpena et al. to determine the cmc values of
the morpholinium gemini surfactants.45,46 This procedure
is based on the assumption that the first derivative of specific conductivity
versus concentration is a Boltzmann-type sigmoidal function 3  where A1 (A2) is the asymptotic value for small (large)
values of the surfactant concentration, x0 is the center of the sigmoidal curve (central point of the transition),
and Δx is the width of the transition. The
integration of eq 3 gives
the following equation 4  where F(0) is the value of
specific conductivity when x is 0 and A1 and A2 are the slopes obtained
in the premicellar and postmicellar segments, respectively. Equation 4 is obtained by performing
the integration of a Boltzmann-type sigmoidal function shown in eq 3. Figure 3 shows standard specific conductivity versus
concentration plot and the plot derived using the mathematical procedure
proposed by Carpena et al. Similarly, the above-mentioned method is
used for deriving the cmc values for [C14MOR(6)C14MOR]2Br; however,
the complexities arising due to the formation of premicellar aggregates
result in uneven sigmoid plot as the equivalent conductivity of small
premicellar aggregates formed below cmc value is always larger than
the sum of the equivalent conductivities of the ions constituting
it (see Figure S7, Supporting Information).

Figure 3 Specific conductivity vs concentration plot and corresponding derived
plot using mathematical eqs 3 and 4 for [C12MOR(6)C12MOR]2Br at 25
°C. The arrow shown in the figure represents the cmc value.

The cmc values of the morpholinium
gemini surfactants determined
by the conductivity methods slightly differ from those determined
by the surface tension experiments (Table 1). Depending on the nature of the surfactant
under investigation, the determined cmc values may differ when evaluated
by two different techniques.47,48 Such behavior has been
often observed for different types of cationic gemini surfactants
and has been previously reported by several research groups.36,43,49,50 Differences in the observed cmc values when evaluated by different
techniques have been attributed to the affinity to form premicellar
aggregates by the surfactants in aqueous solution.48,49 We in our current studies have found that [C14MOR(6)C14MOR]2Br containing
14-carbon tail is able to form premicellar aggregates. However, unlike
[C14MOR(6)C14MOR]2Br, [C12MOR(6)C12MOR]2Br containing 12-carbon tail
is not able to form a premicellar aggregate, but yet irregularity
is observed in the determined cmc values by two different techniques.
However, the difference in cmc calculated by surface tension and conductivity
can be explained on the basis of affinity of [C14MOR(6)C14MOR]2Br
to form premicellar aggregates at lower surfactant concentration in
water. The provided explanation cannot justify the observed results
for [C12MOR(6)C12MOR]2Br as this surfactant does not form premicellar
aggregates. The traces of surface-active impurities if present in
the surfactant sample may also significantly influence the observed
cmc values by two different techniques. Although such impurities may
be present in traces that cannot be detected in proton NMR, they can
have marked influence on the observed cmc values observed by the surface
tension technique. Often if traces of impurities are present in a
surfactant sample, a minimum (dip) is observed in the surface tension
versus surfactant concentration plots.51 However, we in our current studies are not able to observe a minimum
for morpholinium gemini surfactants. Most recently, Thomas et al. summarized the limitations of surface tension experiments
for evaluating cationic surfactants.50 It
has been established that the observed surfactant properties may vary
depending upon the method used for evaluating cationic surfactants.
The positively charged cationic surfactants when evaluated by the
Wilhelmy plate method generally demonstrate some peculiarities in
calculated surface properties, and the observed results considerably
differ when compared with the results evident from other techniques.52 The negative charge on the material (Pt–Ir
or Pt) utilized for designing the Wilhelmy plate has significant influence
on the observed results, especially when oppositely charged surfactants
are evaluated using such materials. On the basis of the anomalous
behavior of cationic surfactants when evaluated by this method, Thomas
et al. concluded that the wetting may be both incomplete and significantly
vary with the concentration of a positively charged cationic surfactant
essentially because of the adsorption of cationic surfactants on negatively
charged solid surfaces.52 In such cases,
the self-aggregation is generally lower than the cmc as the interaction
of a surfactant with the surface is favorable. Thus, the observed
difference in the determined cmc values by two different techniques
may be explained on the basis of affinity of the morpholinium gemini
surfactants to form an adsorbed layer on the oppositely charged Wilhelmy
plate. The error in estimating the surfactant properties including
cmc values becomes even more complicated if the surfactants demonstrate
the ability to form premicellar aggregates.52 Given the widespread use of the Wilhelmy plate method for investigating
the surfactant properties and the practical limitation of using this
method for investigating cationic surfactants, it is more desirable
to determine the cmc values of the cationic gemini surfactant under
investigation by another technique (as calculated by the conductivity
method in current studies).

The degree of counterion binding
(β) which represents the
bromide counterions associated with the micelles in aqueous solution
is calculated from the slope values of the region before and after
the cmc values, observed in the conductivity plot.53 The β values of gemini surfactants indicate the amount
of counterions present in the Stern layer of micelles to counterbalance
the electrostatic force that oppose micelle formation.54 The β values of the morpholinium gemini
surfactant under investigation decrease with increase in hydrophobic
tail length. Similar trend had been previously reported for the polar
group containing thioether-functionalized gemini pyridinium surfactants,55 hydroxyl-functionalized gemini pyridinium surfactants,38 ether-functionalized gemini pyridinium surfactants,14 amide-functionalized quaternary ammonium gemini
surfactants,37 and ester-functionalized
gemini piperidinium surfactants,26 while
no specific trend was observed for gemini imidazolium surfactants.56,57 The observed trend of decrease in β values with increasing
hydrophobic alkyl tail length for gemini surfactants can be explained
on the basis of balance between the electrostatic interactions between
the headgroups and the hydrophobic effect.58 However, most of the functionalized gemini surfactants containing
a polar functional group may also interact with water molecules via
hydrogen bonding, and the new dynamics resulting from the combination
of electrostatic interactions and hydrogen bond formation in the presence
of negatively charged counterions may influence the observed β
values.59 For the ester-based morpholinium
gemini surfactant [C12MOR(6)C12MOR]2Br containing 12-carbon hydrophobic
tail, more counterions are required to reduce the effective nuclear
charge between the headgroups which eventually decreases the repulsion
between the headgroups. With increasing tail length, the hydrophobic
effect becomes a prominent factor and a lesser number of counterions
are required to reduce the effective nuclear charge between the headgroups.
Hence, [C14MOR(6)C14MOR]2Br containing 14-carbon tail has lower β
values compared to its analogue containing 12-carbon hydrophobic tail.

The Gibbs free energy for micellization (ΔGmic°)
denotes the work done to transfer the surfactant monomers from the
air–water interface to the micellar phase and is calculated
from the following equation 5  where R is the gas constant
(8.314 J mol–1 K–1); T is the absolute temperature; and Xcmc is the cmc in molar fraction, Xcmc =
cmc/55.4, where cmc is in mol/L and 55.4 comes from 1 L of water corresponding
to 55.4 mol of water at 25 °C. β is the degree of counterion
binding to micelles.57 The calculated values
of ΔGmic° are negative, indicating that the micellization
is an energetically favorable process for the morpholinium geminis.

2.4 DLS Measurements
The hydrodynamic
radius of the micelles formed by morpholinium gemini surfactants,
[C12MOR(6)C12MOR]2Br and [C14MOR(6)C14MOR]2Br, is determined by the
DLS technique.60

Figure 4 shows the size distribution
of micelles formed by the gemini surfactants for different surfactant
concentrations determined at 25 °C. The results indicate that
the aggregates with different sizes and morphologies are formed depending
on the length of a hydrophobic tail. A narrow single peak is observed
for the micellar solution of [C12MOR(6)C12MOR]2Br at different surfactant
concentrations (i.e., 5, 10, and 20 mM). The determined micelle size
represented by the hydrodynamic radius slightly varied from 1.55 to
1.60 nm depending on the surfactant concentration under investigation
for [C12MOR(6)C12MOR]2Br. Two different size distribution peaks were
observed for [C14MOR(6)C14MOR]2Br at 5 and 10 mM concentration, whereas
single peak was observed for the same surfactant at 2.5 mM surfactant
concentration. The size of the first peak indicating the hydrodynamic
radius varied from 1.81 to 1.83 nm, whereas the size of the second
peak varied from 61.8 to 69.9 nm. The observed results indicate that
the surfactants with a longer hydrophobic tail are able to form different
structural morphologies by varying the concentration.

micelles formed by (a) [C12MOR(6)C12MOR]2Br
and (b) [C14MOR(6)C14MOR]2Br at different surfactant concentrations
investigated at 25 °C.

The new morpholinium gemini surfactants are able to self-aggregate
into relatively smaller nanosized micelles at low surfactant concentration
above their respective cmc values. The hydrodynamic radii of the micelles
formed by morpholinium gemini surfactants in aqueous solution are
smaller compared to that of the conventional quaternary ammonium gemini
surfactants,61 and different categories
of heterocyclic cationic gemini surfactants are piperidinium gemini
surfactants,26 imidazolium gemini surfactants,35 pyrrolidinium gemini surfactants,36 and pyridinium gemini surfactants.39 The ability of gemini morpholinium surfactants
to form nanosized micellar aggregates in dilute aqueous solution can
be explored for several emerging technical application areas.

2.5 Viscosity Measurements
The viscosities
of the micellar solution of morpholinium gemini surfactants were investigated
by a rheometer for different concentrations at 25 °C. The aqueous
micellar solution of both [C12MOR(6)C12MOR]2Br and [C14MOR(6)C14MOR]2Br
demonstrated Newtonian fluid behavior between 10 and 50 wt % because
the observed viscosities are independent of the applied shear rate.
The viscosities of the aqueous micellar solution depend on the concentration
of dissolved gemini surfactants and the length of the hydrophobic
alkyl tail.

The viscosities of the surfactant solution increase
with increase in surfactant concentration as well as the increase
in hydrophobic alkyl chain length. Figure 5 shows viscosity (η) versus shear rate
(γ) plot for the aqueous micellar solution of the morpholinium
gemini surfactants at 25 °C for various concentrations. There
is a little difference in the observed viscosities for both the morpholinium
gemini surfactants at lower surfactant concentration (10 wt %), and
this difference becomes prominent at higher surfactant concentrations
(i.e., 20–50 wt %). The micellar solution of the conventional
quaternary ammonium gemini surfactant of m–s–m type generally demonstrates
Newtonian fluid behavior at lower concentration (≤0.04 mol·L–1 or ≤2.46 wt %) and is viscoelastic in nature
at higher concentration.62 By contrast,
the micellar solution of morpholinium gemini surfactants is Newtonian
fluid up to surfactant concentration as high as 50 wt %. The Newtonian
fluidlike behavior of the morpholinium gemini surfactant at high surfactant
concentration can be attributed to the affinity of these surfactants
to form hydrogen bonding with water. Recent reports suggest that the
physicochemical and rheological properties of the micellar solution
of cationic gemini surfactants containing polar functional groups
may be influenced by the affinity of these molecules to form hydrogen
bonding with water.63,64 Such surfactant solution may
behave as Newtonian or non-Newtonian fluid depending upon the surfactant
concentration and the temperature. Quaternary ammonium gemini surfactants
behave as non-Newtonian fluid at higher surfactant concentration because
these surfactants self-aggregate in aqueous solution above their cmc
values into simple spherical micelles, which generally grow with increasing
surfactant concentration and assume different forms such as rodlike
micelles or flexible wormlike micelles and so forth.65−67 The formation of more complex entangled network structures changes
the solution into a viscoelastic fluid; however, the concentrated
aqueous solution of gemini morpholinium surfactants of surfactant
concentration as high as 50 wt % does not demonstrate viscoelastic
fluid nature. The observed nature of the morpholinium geminis can
be explained on the basis of their ability to form nanosized micelles
at dilute concentration which does not grow into wormlike micelles
at higher concentration.

2.6 Phase Behavior of the Morpholinium Gemini
Surfactant in Water
The phase behavior of the binary morpholinium
gemini surfactant–water system was investigated at 25 °C. Figure 6 shows the phase
diagram for the morpholinium gemini surfactant–H2O system at 25 °C.

Figure 6 Phase diagram of (i) [C12MOR(6)C12MOR]2Br–H2O
system and (ii) [C14MOR(6)C14MOR]2Br–H2O system
at 25 °C. L1 notifies micellar phase, H1 notifies lyotropic hexagonal phase, and S notifies solid phase.

[C12MOR(6)C12MOR]2Br and [C14MOR(6)C14MOR]2Br
form micellar solution
up to 59 and 53 wt % in water, respectively. Above this respective
concentration, the morpholinium gemini surfactants form mixed micellar
(L1) and lyotropic hexagonal (H1) phases. [C12MOR(6)C12MOR]2Br
forms mixed L1 and H1 phases between 59 and
68 wt %, whereas [C14MOR(6)C14MOR]2Br forms mixed L1 and
H1 phases between 53 and 59 wt % in water. Both the gemini
surfactants are able to form stiff and transparent liquid crystalline
phases at higher surfactant concentration in water. The samples of
the liquid crystalline phases formed by these gemini surfactants were
investigated by POM and SAXS analyses. [C12MOR(6)C12MOR]2Br self-aggregates
into H1 lyotropic phase between 68 and 96 wt %, whereas
[C14MOR(6)C14MOR]2Br exists as H1 phase between 59 and
94 wt % in water. These H1 phases are observed as birefringent
POM textures, which is characteristic for the lyotropic H1 phases (Figure 7).

Figure 7 POM images
of the morpholinium gemini surfactant at different wt
% in water.

The SAXS experiments
further confirmed the existence of H1 phases for both the
morpholinium gemini surfactants as the observed
Bragg reflections correspond to hexagonal packing. The value of scattering
vector q was found to be in the ratio q1/q2/q3 = 1:√3:2 for both the morpholinium gemini surfactants,
confirming the existence of H1 phases. Figure 8a,b shows the SAXS patterns
of the [C12MOR(6)C12MOR]2Br–H2O and [C14MOR(6)C14MOR]2Br–H2O systems observed for the H1 phases at 25 °C.
The lattice parameter (α) is calculated from the first peak
position according to the formula (4π/√3)/q100. α signifies the distance between the centers
of two neighboring cylinders and can be directly calculated from the
first Bragg peak (q1). The lattice parameter
gradually decreases with increasing the surfactant concentration from
70 to 90% for the [C12MOR(6)C12MOR]2Br–H2O system
and from 60 to 90% for the [C14MOR(6)C14MOR]2Br–H2O system. This gradual decrease of distance between the centers of
two neighboring cylinders with increasing surfactant concentration
can be attributed to the overall decrease of water cannels in between the cylinder because of the decreasing percentage of
water in the sample.68

Gemini morpholinium surfactants
demonstrated a quite different
binary surfactant–water phase behavior compared to standard
quaternary ammonium gemini surfactants and imidazolium gemini surfactants.
The standard m–s–m-type quaternary ammonium gemini surfactant 12–2–12
with bromide counterion existed as micellar solution up to 39 wt %
gemini surfactant in water at 25 °C.69 Similarly, hydroxyl-functionalized quaternary ammonium gemini surfactant
12–3(OH)–12 containing chloride counterion was able
to exist as micellar phase up to 40 wt % at 25 °C.65 In contrast to quaternary ammonium gemini surfactants,
the morpholinium gemini surfactants, [C12MOR(6)C12MOR]2Br and [C14MOR(6)C14MOR]2Br,
are able to exist as micellar solution up to 59 and 53 wt %, respectively,
in water at 25 °C. The phase behavior of morpholinium geminis
is also significantly different from those observed for imidazolium
gemini surfactant [C12im–4–C12im][Br2]·2H2O as the latter exists as
mixed micellar and hexagonal lyotropic phases up to 80 wt % at room
temperature.70 With increasing surfactant
concentration, the conventional quaternary ammonium gemini surfactant
12–2–12 is able to exist as hexagonal lyotropic phase
up to 58 wt % and then as lamellar liquid crystalline phases up to
80 wt %. Above 80 wt %, the 12–2–12 exists as mixed
solid and lamellar liquid crystalline phases.69 The hydroxyl group containing quaternary ammonium gemini surfactant
12–3(OH)–12 forms H1 phases between 41 and
59 wt % and then exists as mixed hydrated surfactant monoclinic crystals
along with Lα phase between 60 and 97wt %.65 In contrast to the quaternary ammonium gemini surfactants,
the morpholinium gemini surfactants demonstrate the affinity to specifically
exist as H1 lyotropic liquid crystalline phase up to surfactant
concentration as high as 96 wt % (for [C12MOR(6)C12MOR]2Br) and 94
wt % (for [C14MOR(6)C14MOR]2Br). Imidazolium gemini surfactant [C12im–4–C12im][Br2]·2H2O exists as mixed H1 and hydrated solid above 80
wt % up to 95 wt %, and above this concentration, it simply exists
as hydrated/nonhydrated solid.70 The observed
room-temperature phase behavior of morpholinium gemini surfactants
is quite different from the other types of cationic gemini surfactants.
Typically, all other types of gemini cationic surfactants exist as
solid or mixed solid system with other lyotropic phases at high surfactant
concentration in a binary surfactant–water system. However,
the morpholinium gemini surfactants exist as single homogeneous self-assembled
H1 liquid crystalline phases at relatively higher concentration.

3 Conclusions
New morpholinium gemini surfactants
are synthesized and characterized
using spectroscopic techniques. These gemini surfactants are able
to self-aggregate at lower concentration and form nanosized micelles
above their respective cmc values in dilute aqueous solution. The
surface activities and the viscosities of the micellar solution of
the morpholinium geminis are influenced by the length of the hydrophobic
tail. The cmc values of the morpholinium geminis are lower compared
to the conventional monomeric surfactants. Unlike the conventional
gemini cationic surfactants, these new gemini morpholinium surfactants
are able to exist as micellar solution at surfactant concentration
as high as 59 and 53 wt % for [C12MOR(6)C12MOR]2Br and [C14MOR(6)C14MOR]2Br,
respectively. The concentrated aqueous solution of the morpholinium
geminis (10–50 wt %) demonstrated Newtonian fluidlike behavior,
and the viscosities of the micellar solution increased with increase
in surfactant concentration as well as hydrophobic tail length. At
higher concentration, these gemini surfactants formed lyotropic liquid
crystalline phases. [C12MOR(6)C12MOR]2Br formed lyotropic H1 phase between 68 and 96 wt %, whereas [C14MOR(6)C14MOR]2Br formed
similar phases between 59 and 94 wt % in water. The ease of synthesis
combined with the versatile physicochemical properties and the ability
to form self-assembled phases over a wide range of concentrations
make these new morpholinium gemini surfactants ideal for a wide range
of application areas.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials and Methods
Bromoacetic
acid, dodecyl bromide, morpholine, and hexane-1,6-diol were purchased
from TCI, Tokyo, Japan. Hexane-1,6-diyl bis(2-bromoacetate) and 4-dodecylmorpholine
were synthesized according to the previous reported synthetic methodology.26,28 4-Tetradecylmorpholine was synthesized based on the synthetic procedure
adopted for the synthesis for 4-dodecylmorpholine.26,28 Millipore water was used in all experiments. The mass spectra of
gemini surfactants were recorded on a JEOL JMS-T100CS instrument (JEOL
Japan) using ESI as an ion source. 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a JEOL-ECP500 instrument (JEOL Japan)
using CDCl3 as a solvent and tetramethylsilane as an internal
standard.

4.2 Synthesis of Morpholinium Gemini Surfactants
4-Dodecylmorpholine (25.54 g, 0.1 mol) or 4-tetradecylmorpholine
(28.35 g, 0.1 mol) was slowly added over a period of 30 min to the
stirred solution of hexane-1,6-diyl bis(2-bromoacetate) (18.00 g,
0.05 mol) dissolved in chloroform at 20 °C under a nitrogen atmosphere.
After addition, the reaction mixture was stirred for 5 h at 60 °C.
The chloroform was then removed from the crude reaction mixture under
reduced pressure, subsequently washed twice with 100 mL of hexane,
and cold-precipitated in ethyl acetate–diethyl ether mixture
under inert nitrogen atmosphere. The precipitates after the removal
of solvent upon drying in a rotary flash evaporator at 75 °C
for 3 h gave pure morpholinium gemini surfactants: [C12MOR(6)C12MOR]2Br
and [C14MOR(6)C14MOR]2Br.

4.3 Surface Tension Measurements
The
surface tension at the water–air interface was investigated
using a KRÜSS K100 tensiometer (KRÜSS, Germany) by a
Wilhelmy plate at 25 °C. The tensiometer was calibrated using
Millipore water. The experimental runs chosen were based on the time
required for the surfactant solution to attain equilibrium, and hence,
a set of 10 consecutive readings with standard deviation less than
0.1 mN/m–1 were taken into account. The surface
parameters, that is, surface excess concentration (Γcmc), surface area occupied by molecule at the air–water interface
(Amin), the effectiveness of surface tension
reduction (γmin), and the cmc values, were calculated
from the slope of decrease in surface tension with increasing concentration
of the surfactant solution.71

4.4 Conductivity Measurements
The conductivity
of the surfactant solution was measured using a conductivity meter
CM-25R (DKK-TOA Corporation) equipped with a conductivity cell having
a cell constant of 1. The solutions were thermostated at 25 °C
in a thermostated vessel controlled by a temperature controller. The
cmc value was determined by adding an adequate quantity of a concentrated
surfactant solution in water to change the surfactant concentration
below the cmc to at least 2–3 times the cmc value.72,73

4.5 Viscosity Measurements
The viscosities
of the aqueous surfactant solutions were measured using a stress-controlled
rheometer, AR-G2 (TA Instruments) using cone-plate geometries (diameter
40 mm with a cone angle of 2° 0′ 4″) attached to
a temperature controller circulator. The samples were prepared in
screw-capped glass tubes by weighing appropriate surfactant and Millipore
water. The tubes were sealed and kept at 80 °C for 1 h, then
vortexed for 10 min, and centrifuged at 3500 rpm for 30 min. The procedure
was repeated, and the samples were kept for 24 h to attain equilibrium.
The steady shear rheological measurements (viscosity vs shear rate)
were performed at 25 °C. The zero shear viscosity of the solutions
was determined from steady shear rate measurements by extrapolating
the viscosity in shear rate curves to zero shear rate.28

4.6 DLS Measurements
The size of micelles
formed by morpholinium gemini surfactants was measured with a DLS
measuring particle analyzer (Litesizer 500, Anton Paar) at 25.0 °C.
The surfactant solutions of 10 mM concentration were passed through
a PVDA membrane filter with a pore size of 0.22 μm. The samples
were equilibrated for 60 min before measurement, and an average of
five measurement runs were considered for getting the size of micelles.74

4.7 Polarized Optical Microscopy
An appropriate
amount of samples was mounted on the glass slides with a coverslip
placed on the top. The slides were observed under an Olympus microscope
through crossed polarizers at room temperature. The textures observed
were transferred to a computer with the help of a Moticam 2000 digital
camera fitted on the eyepiece. The images were used to characterize
the lyotropic phases inherent in the mixtures.75

4.8 SAXS Measurements
The samples were
prepared in the screw-capped glass tubes by weighing appropriate surfactant
and water. The tubes were sealed and kept at 80 °C for 1 h, then
vortexed for 10 min, and centrifuged at 3500 rpm for 30 min. The procedure
was repeated thrice, and the samples were kept for 1 week to attain
equilibrium. Measurements were performed using a SAXSess camera (Anton
Paar, PANalytical) attached to a PW3830 laboratory X-ray generator
with a long fine-focus sealed-glass X-ray tube (KR wavelength of 0.154
nm; PANalytical). The apparatus was operated at 40 kV and 50 mA. The
SAXSess camera was equipped with focusing multilayer optics and a
block collimator for an intense and monochromatic primary beam with
low background, and a translucent beam stop was used for the measurement
of an attenuated primary beam at zero scattering vector (q = 0). The samples were enclosed in a vacuum-tight thin quartz capillary
with an outer diameter of 1 mm and a thickness of 10 μm. The
sample temperature was controlled with a thermostated sample holder
unit (TCS 120, Anton Paar). The 2D scattering pattern was collected
on an image plate detection system Cyclone (PerkinElmer) and was finally
integrated into one-dimensional scattering curves as a function of
the magnitude of the scattering vector q = (4π/λ)
sin(θ/2) using SAXSquant software (Anton Paar), where θ
is the total scattering angle and λ is the wavelength of the
X-ray. All data were normalized to the same incident primary beam
intensity for the transmission calibration and were corrected for
background scattering from the capillary and the solvent.76
