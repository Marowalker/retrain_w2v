Currently, there is an intensive
development of bio-based aromatic
building blocks to replace fossil-based terephthalates used for poly(ethylene
terephthalate) production. Indole is a ubiquitous aromatic unit in
nature, which has great potential as a bio-based feedstock for polymers
or plastics. In this study, we describe the synthesis and characterization
of new indole-based dicarboxylate monomers with only aromatic ester
bonds, which can improve the thermal stability and glass-transition
temperature (Tg) of the resulting polyesters.
The new dicarboxylate monomers were polymerized with five aliphatic
diols to yield 10 new polyesters with tunable chemical structures
and physical properties. Particularly, the Tg values of the obtained polyesters can be as high as 113 °C,
as indicated by differential scanning calorimetry and dynamic mechanical
analysis. The polyesters showed decent thermal stability and distinct
flow transitions as revealed by thermogravimetric analysis and rheology
measurements.

Introduction
Today, the production
of plastics (polymers) is facing major challenges,
which include, for example, the deployment of fossil resources, the
rise of petrochemical prices, and the environmental issues associated
with the polymer production. Therefore, there is a strong motivation
from the society and industry to switch to sustainable bio-based feedstocks
for the production of plastics.1 To date,
the most successful development of bio-based plastics is Coca-Cola’s
partially bio-based poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) (PlantBottle),2 which constitutes approximately 75% of all of
the bioplastics on the market. Unfortunately, this bio-PET only contains
∼30% mass originated from bio-based production (i.e., bio-based
ethylene glycol), while the remaining ∼70% mass was still based
on the use of fossil-based terephthalic acid (TPA) or dimethyl terephthalate
(DMT). The production of TPA or DMT from renewable starting materials
has been an active research area, which has achieved lab-scale success.3−12 Other benzenoid aromatic monomers (e.g., dicarboxylates or monohydroxycarboxylates)
have also been synthesized and used for the production of aromatic
polyesters as a potential substitution for PET, and their raw materials
include, for example, lignin-derived molecules,13−15 vanillic acid,16−19 resorcinol,20 and cinnamic acid.21−24 In the meantime, alternative nonbenzenoid aromatic building blocks
have also received growing attention, among which furan derivatives
have been intensively explored.

Furan structures exist widely
in nature and can be produced via
different biosynthetic pathways. Particularly, furan-dicarboxylic
acid (FDCA) has been a popular research topic recently, because its
derived polyester (e.g., poly(ethylene furanoate) or PEF) has comparable
mechanical and even better barrier properties compared with PET.25−33 Other furan-based dicarboxylates and polyesters have also been reported
in the literature.28 Unfortunately, the
thermal instability of furan derivatives (e.g., FDCA, or precursors
like 5-hydroxymethylfurfural, or 5-hydroxymethyl-2-furoic acid) has
caused undesirable degradation and coloration during the production
and processing at high temperatures (>200 °C), which hinders
the further development of furan-based polyesters.34 Recently, a novel procedure to prepare bottle-grade PEF
was reported, using a three-step synthesis including polycondensation,
oligomerization, and ring-opening polymerization.35 However, this procedure is complicated and its feasibility
for the plastic industry remains to be explored.

Considering
these challenges, it is time to consider other bio-based
aromatics as “Plan B” for polyester production. Recently,
indole has attracted our attention because it is a large aromatic
unit that exists widely in nature and urban wastes. Indole is also
a major byproduct in coal mining, petroleum, tobacco, and livestock
farming industries36 and is widely used
in pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and material sciences.37−40 Several bioproduction methods for indole are available, including
thermocatalytic conversion and ammonization of biomass-derived furfural
and furan, microalgae pyrolysis, yeast and bacteria fermentation,
reduction of indigo that is derived from plants and microbial production,
and direct conversion from bio-based ethylene glycol and aniline.30−52

Surprisingly, little attention has been paid to the development
of indole-based polyesters. In the literature, the use of indole structures
has been limited to conducting polymers and microporous materials,53−56 polymers with indole pendant groups, polyethersulfones, and poly(N-arylene diindolylmethane)s.57−63 There was only one report in the 1980s describing bis-indole-containing
polyesters without the characterization of properties.64 Recently, a new series of fully bio-based polyesters
were synthesized and reported by our group using a new indole-based
dicarboxylate monomer and five different aliphatic diols.65 The obtained indole-based polyesters were all
amorphous with Tg values of up to 99 °C.
This clearly demonstrated the feasibility of making indole-based polyesters
and its potential to replace fossil-based terephthalate. A remaining
question to be addressed is that the reported series of indole-based
polyesters contain 50% aliphatic ester bonds (i.e., esters derived
from aliphatic carboxylic acids, structure a, Figure 1), which are not present in PET. Such aliphatic
ester bonds are expected to lower the thermal stability of the resulting
polyesters. To achieve better thermal properties, indole-based polyesters
without labile aliphatic ester bonds are of great interest. Herein,
we report our recent synthesis and characterization of two indole-based
dicarboxylate monomers with only aromatic ester bonds (i.e., ester
bonds derived from aromatic acids) and their polymerization with five
bio-based aliphatic diols to yield in total 10 indole-based polyesters.
The thermal, mechanical, and rheological properties of the resulting
polyesters were reported. According to our result, the absence of
weak aliphatic ester bonds in the new series of polyesters clearly
enhanced the thermal stability.

polyesters in this work (b).

Results
and Discussion
Polymer Synthesis
Methyl indole-3-carboxylate
(1) was employed as the starting material for monomer
synthesis,
which can be conveniently synthesized from sustainable raw materials,
e.g., by a base-mediated carboxylation of indole, followed by transesterification
with methanol.66 A possible synthetic route
for 1 from biosourced raw materials is depicted in Figure S1, Supporting Information. Dicarboxylate
monomers (3a,b) were synthesized by a simple SN2 reaction of commercially available methyl indole-3-carboxylate 1 and two different 1,ω-dibromoalkanes (2a,b), respectively (Scheme 1). Purification of the crude products 3a,b by
straightforward recrystallization from toluene afforded white crystals
of monomers with >80% yields. Afterward, monomers 3a,b were polymerized with five potentially bio-based aliphatic diols
(4a–e), according to a conventional
bulk polycondensation protocol using dibutyltin(IV) oxide (DBTO) catalyst
(1 mol %).65,67,68 The polymerization was performed in two stages. In the first stage
(transesterification), an excess of diol (3 equiv of OH groups for 4c–e and 4 equiv of OH groups for 4a,b) was reacted with dicarboxylates (3a,b)
at 180 °C under a slow nitrogen flow to remove the condensed
methanol. Once the transesterification was completed (ca 3 h, according
to 1H NMR analysis), a second stage (polycondensation)
was carried out at 220 °C with a stronger N2 gas flow
to completely remove the condensed diols. In the literature, the removal
of the condensed diols was usually achieved under high vacuum conditions.69 However, when the vacuum condition was applied
for our polymerizations, the obtained polymers always showed an intense
red color, while our new protocol under a N2 gas flow provided
white or colorless polymers (see examples in the Supporting Information, Figure S4a,b). The purification of the polymers
was achieved by simple precipitation in methanol from their solutions.
We noticed that 5bc and 5bd were only soluble
in 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoro-2-propanol (HFIP) or mixtures of HFIP and
chloroform but insoluble in other commonly used organic solvents like
chloroform, dimethyl sulfoxide, dimethylformamide (DMF), dimethylacetamide,
and tetrahydrofuran. The other polymers were all soluble in chloroform.
It was also noted that the indole-based polyester solution in chloroform
slowly developed pink coloration at room temperature after 5 days.
A thin film of 5ad is shown in Figure S4c, which was prepared using the solution of 5ad in chloroform that was stored at room temperature for 5 days. Polymer
films that were prepared directly after the synthesis of the polymers
were colorless and stable when being stored at room temperature.

Scheme 1 Synthesis of Monomers 3ab and Polymerization of 5xy Biopolyesters
The chemical structures of the monomers and polyesters were confirmed
by their 1H NMR spectra. Figure 2 shows the 1H NMR spectra of the
polymer series 5ay (all of the polyesters prepared from
monomer 3a).

Figure 2 1H NMR spectra of monomer 3a and its resulting
polyesters 5ay (y = a–e).

For monomer 3a, the
chemical shifts of CH2 (a and b) appeared at 2.46 and 4.24
ppm, respectively. The chemical
shift of the methyl carboxylate group (c) was found at 3.92 ppm, which
was used to monitor the progress of polymerization during the first
stage (transesterification). The chemical shifts for the indole units
(e–h) were observed at 7.14–8.21 ppm. After the polymerization,
all of the signals became broad (Figures 2 and S2). The
signal b (CH2 next to the nitrogen in 3a)
for all of the polymers shifted upfield (from 4.10 to 3.90 ppm). Moreover,
it was observed that when longer diols were used, the chemical shift
of signal b moved closer to the chemical shift of the corresponding
peak in the monomer. The same effect was also observed for signal
a, which appeared at 2.46 ppm in the monomer spectrum, but moved to
higher field for the polymers (2.42–2.29 ppm). The signals
for the diol units (c–f) were also clearly observed in all
of the polymer spectra. The peak corresponded to the CH2 next to the ester bonds (signal c) was observed at 4.53–4.30
ppm with a downfield shift trend for the polymers with shorter diols.
Between 2.20 and 1.40 ppm, the signals corresponded to the other methylene
groups (d–f) were observed. According to the 1H
NMR spectra, polymers 5ay (y = a–e) were formed. The 1H NMR spectra
of the other series 5by (y = a–e) were also unambiguously assigned (Supporting
Information, Figure S3), which indicated
the successful formation of the polymers.

The molecular weight
of the obtained polyesters was determined
by size exclusion chromatography (SEC, Table 1). Except for two polymers 5ab and 5bb, all of the other polyesters achieved relatively
high molecular weights (Mn ∼ 15 000–35 000
g/mol and Mw ∼ 27 000–60 000
g/mol). For 5ab and 5bb, we have investigated
reaction temperature and time, but the resulting polyesters 5ab and 5bb always showed considerably lower
molecular weights compared with other polymers. This could be attributed
to the lower thermal stability of 5ab and 5bb compared with the other polyesters according to thermogravimetric
analysis (TGA) measurements (Table 1).

The thermal stability of the obtained polyesters was assessed by
TGA (Figure 3). A single-step
weight-loss profile was observed (maximum decomposition rate temperature Td > 380 °C) for all of the polyesters,
and the onset of weight loss (T5%, temperature
for a 5% weight loss) was higher than 330 °C. This showed good
thermal stability of the resulting polyesters.

Figure 3 TGA weight-loss curves
of indole-based polyesters 5xy (x = a–e, y = a–e). The inset shows the correlation
between the weight average molecular weight (Mw) and the temperature for a 1% weight loss (T1%).

A closer examination
of the thermograms in the initial stages of
the thermal decomposition revealed that the T1% values were all above 270 °C, and there was a significant
linear correlation between the T1% values
and the corresponding weight average molecular weight (Mw; see the inset of Figure 3). It is unclear whether the lower molecular weight
was caused by the decreased thermal stability of the polyesters or
the lower thermal stability was caused by the increased content of
vulnerable chain ends for lower-molecular-weight polyesters.

Thermal
Characterization
The thermal transition of
the obtained indole-based polyesters was studied by differential scanning
calorimetry (DSC) (Figure 4).

Figure 4 DSC second heating curves of polyesters 5ay (a) and 5by (b), including Tg values of
polylactic acid (PLA), PET, and Akestra.34,70,71

All of the obtained polyesters were completely amorphous without
any melting endotherm on the heating curves. The glass transitions
were clearly observed with Tg values in
the range of 71–113 °C for 5ay series and
65–100 °C for 5by series. As shown in Figure 5, the Tg values of the same series of polyesters (5ay and 5by) decreased with the decreased length of the
diols used, which was expected because of the higher flexibility of
the polymers with longer methylene “bridges”. In addition, 5ay displayed higher Tg values
than the corresponding 5by (with the same diol used),
due to their higher rigidity imparted by the shorter methylene bridges
inside monomer 3a compared to that of monomer 3b. The Tg values were also independently
measured by dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA). As shown in Figure 6, the Tg values of the polyesters were determined using peak
maximum in the tan δ.

(a) and DMA (b) as a function of the number of CH2 groups
in the diols used for the synthesis. Lines serve to guide the eye.

Figure 6 Storage modulus E′ and tan δ
as a function of temperature for series 5ay (a) and series 5by (b).

Polyesters 5ab and 5bb could not be measured
by DMA due to the insufficient physical integrity for the samples
prepared for DMA measurements, which was possibly caused by their
relatively low molecular weights. In fact, the effects of the relatively
low molecular weights of 5ab and 5bb were
also reflected in their lower Tg values
with respect to the expected values (Figure 5a). Expectedly, the Tg values measured by DMA showed the same trend as those obtained
from the DSC (Figure 5). The differences in the Tg values according
to DSC and DMA are typical, which arise from the different processes
that were measured.72

In addition,
DMA also provided valuable information regarding the
mechanical characteristics of the obtained polyesters in the solid
state. Figure 6 shows
the storage modulus (E′) and the tan δ
as a function of the temperature. All of the polyesters displayed
typical temperature-unaffected glassy modulus below Tg. The observed E′ values at 30
°C were found between 1.8 and 2.7 GPa for 5ay and
1.7 and 2.2 GPa for 5by. Both series showed decreasing E′ values as longer diols were used.

Rheological
Analysis
Polyesters having a Tg superior to PET (76 °C), namely, 5aa, 5ac, 5ad, 5ba, 5bc, and 5bd, were studied by melt rheology.34 The time–temperature superposition was
applied to the data obtained from the measurements in a frequency
range between 500 and 0.1 rad/s at 10 °C intervals from 170 to
220 °C (5aa was studied between 180 and 230 °C).
The thermorheological simplicity of these polyesters was confirmed
as good overlap was attained by shifting moduli and viscosity into
master curves. A reference temperature (Tr ∼ 220 °C) was used for the comparison among all of the
obtained polyesters in a frequency range of five decades up to 104 rad/s. As a representative plot, Figure 7 shows the master curve of both storage (G′) and loss (G″) moduli
of 5bd, which depicts its typical linear viscoelastic
behavior at the terminal zone and beyond the limit of the rubbery
plateau region. At the crossover frequency ωt (where G′ = G″), a typical terminal
relaxation time τt = 1/ωt was observed.
This relaxation was consistent with the disentanglement relaxation
time, which was observed in all of the measured polyesters (Figure S5). Furthermore, the storage modulus G′ (Figure 7) showed an additional relaxation time at low frequencies,
which could be attributed to the observed bubbles in the samples after
the rheology measurements.

Figure 7 Storage G′ and loss G″
moduli master curves of 5bd at Tr = 220 °C.

The deformation of these
bubbles during the oscillatory shear deformation
can cause an additional elastic component that dominates at low frequencies.73,74 As a result, an increased G′ but unchanged G″ was observed by the slopes of 0.95–0.97,
which was consistent with the expected slope of G″ ≈ 1 for non-cross-linked polymer melts at low frequencies
in the terminal region.

Figure 8 shows the
complex viscosity η* master curves of polyesters 5aa, 5ac, 5ad, 5ba, 5bc, and 5bd. In the low-frequency limit, the elastic component
to η* disappears and the viscosity becomes independent of the
frequency as the material behaves increasingly Newtonian. This frequency-independent
viscosity is the zero-shear viscosity η0, which is
approximately proportional to Mw for most
polymers.75 However, the soft increase
in the complex viscosity observed at low frequencies can be ascribed
to the increase of G′ caused by the existence
of bubbles. At higher frequencies, a typical shear-thinning behavior
was observed as the polyesters became non-Newtonian. All of the polyesters
displayed comparable η0 values, which was consistent
with their decent molecular weight.

Figure 8 Complex viscosity η* master curves
of 5aa, 5ac, 5ad, 5ba, 5bc,
and 5bd at Tr = 220 °C.

All of the six measured polyesters showed thermorheological
simplicity,
which obeyed the Williams–Landel–Ferry (WLF) equation 1  In the WLF equation, aT is the temperature
shift factor employed to generate the
master curves, T is the temperature, Tr is an arbitrary reference temperature (220 °C in
this study), and C1 and C2 are the empirical constants obtained from curve-fitting.75 As shown in Figure 9b, the WLF fits displayed a typical behavior
for aT against the temperature. The values
of C1 and C2 depended on Tr, and they can be transformed
into C1g and C2g values according to eqs 2 and 3 below that are
comparable with literature values.75 As
shown in Table 1 and Figure 9b, the C1g and C2g values for the obtained polyesters 5ac, 5ad, 5ba, 5bc, and 5bd were consistent
with the literature values for commercial polymers like PET, polylactic
acid, etc.75−77 Interestingly, the most rigid polyester that we prepared
(5aa) showed a significantly deviated C2g value, for
which the exact reason still remained to be unraveled. 2   3

Conclusions
A
series of indole-based polyesters were successfully synthesized
by the bulk polycondensation of indole-based dicarboxylate monomers
and five aliphatic bio-based diols. The obtained polyesters contained
only aromatic ester bonds, which enhanced their thermal stability
and structural rigidity. Varied lengths of methylene bridges were
contained in the new indole-based polyesters, which resulted in tunable Tg values in the range of 65–113 °C.
This indicated that these polymers could be potentially used in a
wide range of applications replacing commercial polyesters like PET,
poly(ethylene terephthalate) glycol (PETG), Akestra, or Tritan. The
new indole-based polyesters were amorphous and optically transparent,
which could be conveniently prepared into nonbrittle thin films. Melt
rheology measurements of the new polyesters showed a distinct relaxation
associated with disentanglements. In the future, investigations on
the copolymerization of indole-based dicarboxylate monomers with rigid
bis-phenolic building blocks (e.g., various “phytomonomers”
derived from lignin)21 to produce whole
aromatic polyesters may have the potential to further improve the
thermal and mechanical properties of indole-based polyesters toward
high-performance engineering bioplastics.

Synthesis of Polyesters
The procedure for the synthesis
of 5ad was described as a general protocol, and all of
the other polyesters were prepared similarly. 1,6-Hexanediol (0.94
g, 7.94 mmol, 3.0 equiv), monomer 1 (1.03 g, 2.65 mmol,
1 equiv), DBTO (6.59 mg, 1 mol % with respect to 1),
and 2 mL xylenes were added to a two-necked round-bottom flask equipped
with a mechanical stirrer. After 15 min under reflux and under a flow
of N2, xylenes were distilled off and the reaction mixture
was heated up to 180 °C. Once transesterification of 1 was completed (approximately 3 h, observed by 1H NMR),
the flow of N2 was increased and the mixture was heated
to 220 °C for 20 h. The resulting material was dissolved in 7
mL chloroform and precipitated in 500 mL MeOH. The white small fibers
formed were filtered off and washed repeatedly with methanol. Drying
at 50 °C under vacuum overnight afforded 1.09 g (93%) of a white
fiberlike powder. 1H NMR (400.13 MHz, CDCl3)

Analytical Methods
Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)
measurements were carried out on a Bruker DRX400 spectrometer at a
proton frequency of 400.13 MHz and a carbon frequency of 100.61 MHz.
Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra were measured with an attenuated
total reflection setup using a Bruker Alpha FT-IR spectrometer. Twenty-four
scans were coadded using a resolution of 4 cm–1.
Size exclusion chromatography (SEC) was performed in chloroform at
35 °C with a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min. The SEC equipment used
was a Viscotek 305 TDA, which included a guard column and two Malvern
Panalytical general purpose mixed bed columns with an exclusion limit
of 20 × 106 Da for polystyrene. Detection consisted
of a conventional dual-cell refractive index detector, a four-capillary
bridge viscometer, and a light scattering detector operating at 3
mW, at a wavelength of 670 nm, and measurement angles of 90 and 7o. The three detectors were calibrated with a polystyrene standard
(96 kDa) from Polymers Laboratories. Molecular weights were determined
by the triple-detection method using the OmiSEC. 5.12. Software (Malvern).
Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements were performed
using TA Instruments DSC Q2000. The samples were studied with a heating
rate of 10 °C/min under nitrogen with a purge rate of 50 mL/min.
The sequence consisted of a heating ramp from 40 to 200 °C, followed
by a cooling ramp to −50 °C, and finally a heating ramp
to 220 °C, which was employed to determine the glass-transition
temperature (Tg). Thermogravimetric analysis
(TGA) was performed with a thermogravimetric analyzer TA Instruments
Q500 at a heating rate of 10 °C/min, under nitrogen with a purge
rate of 50 mL/min. Dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) was performed
on a TA Instruments Q800 dynamic mechanical analyzer in an oscillatory
bending mode at a frequency of 1 Hz, an oscillatory amplitude of 15
μm, and with a temperature ramp of 3 °C. Optically clear
freestanding rectangular specimens (l: 8 mm, w: 5 mm, t: 1 mm) were prepared by compression-molding
at 200 °C for 10 min. The rheological analysis was performed
on an Advance Rheometer AR2000 ETC from TA Instruments. The characterization
was carried out under a N2 atmosphere and using a disposable
20 mm diameter aluminum parallel-plate geometry with a gap of ca.
1 mm. Dynamic strain sweep measurements were carried out at 1 Hz from
a 0.1 to 100% oscillatory strain to determine the viscoelastic linear
region. Dynamic frequency sweep experiments were performed in the
linear viscoelastic region at an oscillatory strain of 2% and a frequency
range of 0.1–500 rad/s.
