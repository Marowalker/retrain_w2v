Strategies
to fabricate biofunctionalized surfaces are essential
for many biotechnological applications. Zwitterionic lipid bilayer
coatings doped with lipids with chemically selective headgroups provide
a robust platform for immobilization of biomolecules in an antifouling,
protein resistant background. Herein, we assess the biological activity
of two important components of the extracellular matrix (ECM), collagen
type I (Col I) and fibronectin (FN), which are covalently attached
to a supported lipid bilayer (SLB), and compare their activity with
the same proteins, nonspecifically adsorbed onto a SiO2 surface. The characterization of protein coatings by quartz crystal
microbalance with dissipation revealed that Col I and FN attached
to SLB are less dense and have higher structural flexibility than
when adsorbed onto SiO2. Cell adhesion, proliferation,
and function, as well as Col I–FN interactions, were more efficient
on the ECM-functionalized SLB, making it a promising platform for
cell-based diagnostics, tissue engineering, medical implants, and
biosensor development.

Introduction
Controlled functionalization
of solid surfaces with proteins is
a critical step in the development of biointeractive surfaces employed
in advanced technologies such as cell-based diagnostics and therapies,
tissue engineering, biomolecular therapies, and biosensors.1−6 Proteins usually physically adsorb to commonly used surfaces such
as metal oxides, glass, polystyrene, and gold. The protein–surface
interaction is a result of a complex interplay between many factors
including (i) environmental conditions such as temperature,7 pH, and salinity,8 (ii) protein properties9 such as size,
structural stability, and composition, as well as, (iii) surface properties
such as polarity, charge, and roughness.10 However, depending on the interaction strength between proteins
and the surface, proteins may undergo structural rearrangements or
even denature upon adsorption.10−12 The biological activity and function
of proteins, such as enzymatic activity or presentation of ligands
for specific receptors, usually originate from the functional domains
in their 3D structures that specifically interact with other biomolecules.
Consequently, any surface-induced structural deformation may alter
the protein function. Moreover, the part of the protein molecule which
interacts with the surface is not available for other interactions.
Thus, strategies to coat surfaces with proteins whilst preserving
their biological activities are of importance for the successful development
of tailored biomaterial surfaces. In this regard, supported lipid
bilayers (SLBs)13 offer unique possibilities
for controlled functionalization of solid surfaces.14,15

SLBs are biomembrane-mimetic coating materials that are biocompatible.
Importantly, lipid membrane coatings composed of zwitterionic lipids
that have both a positively and a negatively charged moiety within
the same headgroup (such as phosphorylcholine) are nonfouling and
resistant to nonspecific adsorption of proteins16 and cells.17 However, specific
lipids containing reactive headgroups such as amine or free carboxylic
acid,18 or specific chemical functionalities,
such as biotin19 or DNA oligonucleotides,20 can be introduced into the membrane to act as
linkers to specifically attach proteins or any biomolecule of interest
to the membrane surface. The protein resistance but functionalizable
characteristics of lipid membranes have led to many applications in
biomedical research and biotechnology. The applications include the
design of various innovative biointerfaces for optically or electrically
active substrates in biosensors, passivation of micro and nanofluidics,21 and functionalization of nanoparticles for targeted
drug delivery applications.22−24 In addition, SLBs functionalized
with cell-binding peptides25−28 have been developed for studying cell behavior. In
this regard, it is important to evaluate the biological activity of
proteins that covalently attach to SLBs.

Collagen type I (Col
I)29 and fibronectin
(FN)30 belong to a collection of molecules
called the extracellular matrix (ECM),31 which are secreted by cells and provide structural and biochemical
support to the surrounding cells. They are of immense biomedical importance
and have central roles in cell adhesion. This feature has been exploited
to mediate adhesion of cells to synthetic surfaces coated with ECM
for biomaterial and tissue-engineering applications.32−35 In addition, SLBs functionalized with Col I and FN have also been
demonstrated to be an efficient platform for mammalian cell culture,
and it has been shown that, for instance, smooth muscle cells retained
normal growth behavior on such platforms.36,37

Herein, we provide a comparative assessment of the biological
activity
of Col I and FN when they are (i) attached to the SLB via covalent
bonding and (ii) adsorbed nonspecifically to a SiO2 surface.
To this end, protein adsorption to each surface was quantified by
quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation (QCM-D). The amount of
adsorbed protein to each platform was used as a framework for comparison
of the protein biological activities including the cell attachment,
proliferation, and function, as well as protein–protein interactions.

Results
and Discussion
First, we demonstrate the preparation and
characterization of ECM-functionalized
bilayer platforms; then, we compare the biological activity of ECM
proteins on SLB platforms with those prepared on SiO2 or
glass. As mentioned before, the common strategy to functionalize lipid
bilayers is to incorporate lipid-like molecules with chemically reactive
headgroups into the bilayer structure.38 The functionalized lipids act as an anchor to immobilize specific
biomolecules containing the corresponding binding moiety to the membrane
surface. Importantly, the degree of biomolecule conjugation to the
bilayer can be controlled by the fraction of functional lipids included
in the bilayer.

Figure 1a illustrates
the schematics of a solid surface coated with a lipid bilayer that
is functionalized with ECM proteins. In the current work, we prepared
bilayers composed of 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine
(DOPC) doped with 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-(glutaryl) (DP-NGPE). DOPC (Figure 1b) is a neutral, zwitterionic lipid that
provides resistance to protein adhesion and gives the bilayer its
antifouling capabilities. DP-NGPE serves as a functionalized lipid
whose headgroup bears a free carboxylic acid (Figure 1b). After activation, DP-NGPE can react covalently
with amine-containing biomolecules (e.g., proteins).

model membranes functionalized with ECM molecules via covalent bonding

in this study, together with their chemical names. (c) QCM-D frequency
shift (ΔF, top panel) and dissipation (ΔD, bottom panel) for the third overtone were measured as
a function of time during the formation of the planar bilayer on silicon
dioxide. SLBs were formed on SiO2 via a solvent-assisted
lipid bilayer (SALB) formation method using an isopropanol solution
of a zwitterionic lipid (DOPC) and a lipid bearing a free carboxylic
acid for amine coupling (DP-NGPE). Arrows indicate the injection of
(i) tris buffer (10 mM tris, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.5), (ii) isopropanol,
(iii) lipid mixture [0.5 mg/mL of DOPC/DP-NGPE (5:1) in isopropanol],
and (iv) tris buffer solution leading to a final ΔF and ΔD of −25 ± 1 Hz and 0.4
± 0.2 × 10–6, respectively, which correspond
to a planar bilayer. (d) Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching
(FRAP) snapshots of DP-NGPE doped bilayer containing 0.5 wt % Rho-PE
lipid, immediately (top) and 1 min (below) after photobleaching, showing
almost complete recovery, indicating the fluidity of the SLB.

Previously, Huang et al.36,37 used the vesicle fusion
method to form a SLB containing various fractions of DP-NGPE. Vesicle
fusion, which involves the spontaneous adsorption and rupture of phospholipid
vesicles, is the most commonly used method to form SLBs. However,
under physiological conditions, vesicle fusion is limited to only
a subset of lipid compositions and solid supports. In this work, the
surface was coated with phospholipid bilayer using the so-called SALB
formation method.39 The SALB method is
based on the reverse-phase evaporation phenomenon and involves lipid
deposition onto a hydrophilic solid surface in an alcohol, for example,
isopropanol, followed by the slow exchange of the alcohol with water,
resulting in the formation of a lipid bilayer on the surface.40 The SALB method has been applied successfully
to a wide variety of surfaces including SiO2, and those
which are intractable to the conventional vesicle fusion method, such
as Au,39 Al2O3,41 and graphene.42 In
addition, the SALB method enables formation of bilayers composed of
lipids that cannot be formed by the vesicle fusion method, for example,
those containing large fractions of cholesterol.43,44

The bilayer formation on a solid surface and subsequent protein
conjugation were monitored by the QCM-D monitoring measurement technique.36,37 QCM-D allows real-time monitoring of adsorption processes involving
lipid membranes and proteins.45 The method
records the frequency change (ΔF), which depends
on the total effective mass of the adlayer, which consists of the
mass of the coating material plus entrapped and coupled water. A negative
change in ΔF indicates an increase in the mass
of the adlayer. In addition, QCM-D measures energy dissipation (ΔD), which reflects the softness/rigidness of the adlayer.
A perfectly rigid film, such as SLB, has a near zero energy dissipation,
whereas softer adlayers, such as proteins, exhibit greater energy
dissipation.

Figure 1c represents
the time course of ΔF (top panel) and ΔD (bottom panels) shift during SALB formation on silicon
dioxide. A typical SALB formation experiment involved baseline recording
in the aqueous buffer solution (i), the addition of isopropanol (ii),
the addition of the lipid mixture [0. 5 m/mL, DOPC/DP-NGPE (8:2)]
in isopropanol (iii), and solvent exchange back into the initial buffer
solution (iv). The final frequency and dissipation values after complete
solvent replacement were −25 ± 1 Hz and 0.4 ± 0.2,
respectively, corresponding to formation of a planar bilayer. The
formation of the bilayer was further confirmed by FRAP analysis showing
lateral mobility of lipids in the two-dimensional plane of the membrane
with a diffusion coefficient of 2 ± 0.3 μm2/s
(Figure 1d), which
is comparable to previously reported values.39

Next, we studied the adsorption of Col I and FN to the SLB
and
compared the results with their adsorption to SiO2. All
steps were monitored by QCM-D. To this end, after the SLB formed,
it was incubated with 1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-3-ethylcarbodiimide
(EDC)/N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) to activate the
carboxylic groups of DP-NGPE, followed by injection of the protein
solution. Figure 2a
shows the changes in ΔF and ΔD during Col I conjugation. In this and other QCM-D graphs,
the bilayer formation and EDC/NHS incubation were not shown and the
frequency shift was normalized with ΔF = 0
Hz corresponding to the planar lipid bilayer in each experiment. During
the adsorption of Col I to the SLB, ΔF decreased
and saturated at ΔF = −122 ± 5
Hz. At the same time, ΔD increased and stabilized
at ΔD = 32.7 ± 0.6 × 10–6. After the protein adsorption approached the saturation level, the
pure buffer was injected, which resulted in almost no change in ΔF and ΔD, indicating that Col I had
irreversibly adsorbed to the surface. The high energy dissipation
indicates the softness and viscoelastic nature of the Col I film,
suggesting that Col I fibers did not rigidly attach to the underlying
bilayer. In addition, the high dissipation indicates the presence
of a high amount of water molecules coupled to the Col I fibers resulting
in a hydrated layer with high mass and dissipation. The immunofluorescence
microscopy of the Col I-coated SLBs, prepared using the same protocol
in a microfluidic chamber for microscopy, also showed attachment of
Col I fibers randomly to the SLB surface (Figure 2a, inset).

and SiO2 platforms.
QCM-D monitoring of (a) Col I and (d) FN attachment to bilayer via
covalent bonding. The SLB on silicon dioxide was initially formed
by the SALB method, and then the measurement time was normalized.
Frequency shift (ΔF, blue) and energy dissipation
shift (ΔD, red) for the third overtone (n = 3) were measured as a function of time. Protein solution
(0.2 mg/mL) was introduced to the surface after treatment of SLBs
with EDC/NHS. The insets show the fluorescence immunostaining micrograph
of SLB functionalized with Col I fibers (a) and FN (d). Proteins were
stained using fluorescently labeled anti-Col I or anti-FN antibodies.

Col I and (f) FN adsorption to the SLB and SiO2 surface.
The dashed line shows that at any given frequency, the corresponding
dissipation was bigger for protein layer on the SLB. Scale bars are
20 μm.

For comparison, Col I
adsorption on the SiO2 substrate
with no SLB coating was examined by QCM-D, as shown in Figure 2b. Adsorption of Col I to the
surface was revealed by a negative frequency shift and a simultaneous
increase in the dissipation reaching a saturation value of ΔFCol I = −186 ± 60 Hz and ΔDCol I = 42 ± 19 × 10–6. A buffer wash step resulted in a small change in ΔF (1.75 ± 1 Hz) and ΔD (1.25
± 0.5), indicating the majority of Col I irreversibly adsorbed
to the surface. Comparing the ΔFCol I for SLB and SiO2 suggests that more Col I adsorbed to
SiO2 than to SLB. The frequency shift for Col I adsorption
to SiO2 was almost 1.5 times greater than that of SLB.
The higher frequency shift indicates that more Col I adsorption to
the bare SiO2 surface. In agreement with QCM-D results,
the fluorescent images also revealed that a greater amount of Col
I fibers adsorbed to the bare glass (Figure 2b, inset).

The proteins adsorbed nonspecifically
to the glass surface. In
contrast, zwitterionic lipid bilayer has previously been shown to
be quite efficient in preventing protein adsorption at interfaces.
The exact mechanism for the nonfouling behavior of zwitterionic bilayers
is not known; however, the cooperative contribution of the following
factors has been proposed to be important:16 (i) the charged neutrality of zwitterionic lipids in a wide range
of pH weakens the electrostatic interaction between bilayer and proteins,
(ii) the presence of a hydration layer which strongly associates with
lipid headgroups acts as a barrier for protein adsorption, and (iii)
the high lateral mobility of lipids in the membrane plane. Because
of the nonfouling feature of the bilayer, Col I fibers attach to the
bilayer surface exclusively via the anchoring lipids (DP-NGPE). The
activated carboxylic acid of DP-NGPE covalently binds to lysine residues
which contain the primary amine side chain. Therefore, the Col I fibers
attached to the bilayer surface via a limited number of lysine residues
that are dispersed along the fibers. As a result, fewer fibers attach
to the membrane surface in comparison to those on the SiO2 substrate. To gain more information about the structure of the Col
I film on SLB and SiO2, the correlation between energy
dissipation and frequency change was studied. Figure 2c shows ΔD versus
ΔF during Col I adsorption on SLB and SiO2. At any given frequency, the corresponding energy dissipation
is higher for Col I on the bilayer. In other words, the Col I film
on SLB has a higher structural flexibility than that on SiO2.This is expected as, due to the limited number of anchoring points
along the fiber, the Col I film on SLB is less dense than that on
SiO2.

The same series of experiments were performed
to prepare and characterize
the FN-coated bilayer and SiO2, as shown in Figure 2d–f. The QCM-D results
show a frequency and dissipation shift of −21 ± 2.1 Hz
and 1.4 ± 0.4 × 10–6 for the FN-coated
bilayer, respectively. The fluorescence micrograph of FN on SLB shows
the presence of some unevenly distributed FN aggregates which appear
as particularly brighter spots. The interaction of FN with the supported
bilayer has been previously studied and the formation of FN aggregates
at the membrane interface has been shown by atomic force microscopy
(AFM).46 The frequency and dissipation
shifts for FN adsorption to SiO2 were 101.3 ± 6 Hz
and 6.9 ± 1.3 × 10–6, respectively (Figure 2d–e), which
are similar to the Col I samples, and are higher than those of FN
adsorption to SLB. In contrast to FN on SLB, the fluorescence micrograph
of FN on SiO2 revealed a uniform, highly packed layer (Figure 2e, inset). FN adsorbed
to the bilayer only through the covalent binding to DP-NGPE, but nonspecifically,
entirely covering the SiO2 surface. Similar to the trend
observed for the Col I samples (Figure 2c), the FN film on SLB was softer than that on SiO2 (Figure 2f).
In addition, the frequency and dissipation corresponding to the adsorption
of FN on SLB and SiO2 were lower than those of Col I, due
to its lower molecular weight and compact globular structure.47

Next, we examined the biological activity
of Col I and FN adsorbed
sequentially to SLB and SiO2. We began by studying the
Col I–FN interaction on the SLB and SiO2 platforms.
The interaction of Col I and FN is essential for cell adhesion and
migration. FN molecules can bind to a specific domain sequence within
the Col I fiber.48 To study the Col I–FN
interaction, FN was added to the Col I-coated platforms, and its binding
was monitored by QCM-D and visualized by fluorescence microscopy. Figure 3a shows the QCM-D
results for the adsorption of FN to Col I-coated SLB. After bilayer
formation and subsequent Col I conjugation, FN was injected. Due to
the organization of Col I in a fiber structure, there are many FN
binding sites available on Col I fibers. The significant changes of
resonance frequency (ΔFCol I+FN = −420.7 ± 70.5 Hz) and energy dissipation (ΔDCol I+FN = 84.7 ± 19.2 × 10–6) indicate the tendency of FN to bind to Col I on
SLB as shown in Figure 3a. As a control, BSA was added to the Col I-decorated bilayer (see Figure S1). No change in ΔF and ΔD was observed after BSA injection,
indicating that BSA did not adsorb to the Col I-decorated SLB. This
observation suggests that FN adsorption to this platform was the result
of specific interactions between Col I and FN.

I fibers on SLB and SiO2 platforms.

Col I-coated SLB after incubation with FN, stained by fluorescently

of the SLB. (d) QCM-D measurement of FN adsorption to Col I-coated
SiO2. (e) Fluorescence micrograph of Col I-coated glass,
after incubation with FN, stained by fluorescently labeled anti-FN
antibodies. The initial baseline values in (a) and (d) are the normalized
frequency and dissipation shifts for the bilayer (defined as ΔFSLB = 0). Immunostaining of FN revealed its
co-localization with Col I fibers. All scale bars are 20 μm.

Figure 3b shows
the fluorescence micrograph of Col I-coated SLB after addition of
FN. In this figure, only FN was stained using a specific antibody.
Fluorescence staining of FN in this sample revealed the co-localization
with Col I fibers due to Col I–FN binding. Also, we checked
if the underlying bilayer retains its fluidity after conjugation with
Col I and FN (Figure 3c). FRAP analysis indicated that the bilayer maintains its mobility
after functionalization with multiple protein systems (Col I–FN)
with a long-range lateral mobility of 0.7 ± 0.2 μm2 s–1. The high lateral mobility of the underlying
membrane suggests that protein conjugation was mainly mediated via
the anchoring lipids, and the rest of the lipids were free to diffuse.
The mobility of the bilayer may assist the lipid anchor in displacing
and thus helping the fibers to assume a conformation with less strain.

Next, for comparison, we examined the sequential adsorption of
Col I and FN to the SiO2 or glass surfaces. Figure 3d shows the time course of
frequency and dissipation shifts upon subsequent addition of Col I
and FN to the SiO2 substrate. The adsorption of FN to the
Col I-coated SiO2 surface resulted in frequency and dissipation
shifts of ΔFCol I+FN = −465
± 144.2 Hz and ΔDCol I+FN = 72.5 ± 37.5 × 10–6, respectively.
These results suggest that in both platforms, FN could specifically
bind to the Col I fibers. However, the ratio of FN to Col (ΔFFN/ΔFCol I) was greater for SLB (2.4 ± 0.4) than that for SiO2 (1.5 ± 0.1). In other words, the amount of FN molecules per
Col I fiber was greater (p ≤ 0.01) for SLB
than that for SiO2. The data suggest that the FN binding
sites on Col I fibers that adsorbed to SLB were more accessible than
the ones on SiO2. This is consistent with QCM-D results
showing that Col I fibers on SLB have a higher structural flexibility.

Next, we studied the cell-adhering activity of FN and Col I adsorbed
to SLB and glass. The various ECM components including Col49,50 and FN51 interact specifically with different
cells through integrins as specialized cell surface receptors. Integrins
bind to specific domains within the ECM proteins and mediate adhesion
of cells to the matrix proteins. In addition, integrin receptor interaction
with ECM proteins also initiates an intracellular signaling cascade
that directs cellular processes such as cell survival,52 proliferation,53 differentiation,54 and migration.55

We plated the same number of cells on the Col I- or FN-coated SLB
and glass surfaces and measured the number and area of adhered cells.
The aim was to determine the effect of protein coverage on the extent
of cell adhesion and spreading. As a model, we used Huh 7.5 cells,
which are a human hepatocyte cell line. The hepatic ECM consists mostly
of FN and some Col I, which makes Huh 7.5 cells a suitable model for
our study.56

To assess cell attachment
and spreading, cells were stained and
analyzed with an epifluorescence microscope. Figure 4a,b presents the fluorescence images for
actin-stained Huh 7.5 cells attached on Col I- and FN-coated SLB after
24 h and shows cells attached and spread well on these platforms.
However, in agreement with previous reports,17,25,36,37 when cells
were seeded on ECM-free SLB, only a limited number of cells attached
and remained rounded and did not appreciably spread over 24 h. As
cells attach to surfaces via their surface proteins, the limited cell
attachment to the ECM-free bilayer can be related to the SLB’s
resistance to the adsorption of cell adhesive proteins.

glass. Representative confocal images of one day plated Huh 7.5 cells

FN-functionalized glass. Representative confocal images of one day

stained by Alexa Flour 555-labeled phalloidin (red), and nuclei were
stained by DAPI (blue). All scale bars are 40 μm. (g) The average
projected area of Huh 7.5 cells plated on different platforms after
24 h. (h) Number of cells per absolute values of the maximum QCM-D
frequency shifts due to the amount of adsorbed proteins. The images
were taken by optical microscope and analyzed with ImageJ. The observation
field was 0.5 mm2 (n = 3, mean ±
SD, ***P ≤ 0.001).

On glass, the cells attached and spread on the ECM-coated
(Figure 4d,e), as well
as
bare, surface (Figure 4f). A quantitative analysis of the images (see Figure S2) indicated that the projected area of cells adhered
to glass platforms was larger than that of their SLB counterparts
(Figure 4g). This is
because Col I and FN on SLBs are less resistant to displacement when
experiencing force from the cell. The reason is that the functional
lipids, which anchor the proteins to the membrane, are free to move
in the plane of the fluid underlying the membrane. In addition, for
both SLB and glass, the same trend for cell area was observed; the
cell area was larger on the FN-coated surfaces as compared to that
on the Col I-coated and uncoated surfaces.37

To determine how the cell-adhering activity of Col I and FN
was
influenced by adsorption to SLB and glass, the number of attached
cells on each platform was divided by protein surface coverage. The
protein coverage can be estimated from the QCM-D frequency change.
Although the Sauerbrey model57 can be used
to convert the frequency shift to mass for rigid films, mass determination
for soft layers is not trivial. However, as the exact value for protein
mass is not required for our analysis, we use frequency shifts as
an indicator for the adsorbed mass and apply them for comparative
analysis. Figure 4h
shows the number of cells normalized as cells/ΔFCol I or FN for glass and SLB.

For
both Col I and FN, the normalized cell number was higher for
SLB than that for glass. This result suggests that even though the
protein coverage on the glass surface was greater than that on SLB,
the biological activity of Col I and FN was greater on SLB. The cell
attachment is mediated by integrin interaction with specific domains
in Col I and FN. RGD is the principal integrin-binding domain present
within ECM proteins such as Col I and FN.58 As Col I and FN interact strongly with the glass surface, they form
a relatively dense layer upon surface adsorption and possibly undergo
surface-induced conformational changes. In addition, there is a possibility
of denaturing when the interaction between a passively adsorbed protein
and the surface is too strong.59,60 As a result, the cell-binding
sites (RGD) of a substantial population of adsorbed protein molecules
may not be accessible to the cells in the solution phase. However,
on SLB, the proteins retain their structural flexibility. Also, the
local chemical environment of the phospholipid bilayer mimics that
of the natural cell membrane and helps the immobilized protein molecules
to maintain their activity and accessibility.

To further investigate
the biological activity of Col I and FN
on SLB and glass, we compared the viability and function of the cells
plated on the Col I, FN, and Col I–FN platforms (Figure 5). The physical contact between
cell and ECM through integrin and nonintegrin cell surface proteins
can trigger chemical pathways leading to cell growth and division.
Therefore, we measured Huh 7.5 proliferation on ECM-coated platforms
as a function of protein coverage.

Figure 5 Cell viability and metabolic functions
on ECM-coated platforms.
(a) Representative fluorescence micrograph images of detecting live
(green) and dead (red) Huh 7.5 cells cultured on SLB and glass coated
with Col I and FN and Col I–FN at 1 and 3 days post seeding.
Scale bar is 200 μm. (b) Proliferation of Huh 7.5 cells was
measured over a 3 day period. The values were normalized to the absolute
frequency shifts due to the amount of adsorbed proteins. (c) Albumin
production by Huh 7.5 cells plated on different platforms measured
after 24 h of cell growth. The values were normalized to the total
number of cells (n = 3, mean ± SD, *P ≤ 0.05, **P ≤ 0.01, ***P ≤ 0.001, and ****P ≤ 0.0001).

The viability of cells on the
ECM-coated SLB and glass surfaces
were quantified using a live/dead assay combined with a fluorescence
microscope at day 1 and 3. As shown in Figure 5a over 90% of Huh 7.5 cells were viable on
all platforms within three days. Next, cell proliferation was measured
using the CCK-8 assay61,62 by dividing the number of cells
at day 3 by those at day 1. The obtained proliferation value for each
surface was then normalized to its corresponding QCM-D frequency shift
upon protein adsorption (Figure 5b). For all cases, the normalized proliferation was
higher for the SLB platforms. In particular, the cell proliferation
on FN-coated SLB was significantly greater than that of glass.

The interaction of cells with ECM can also alter the cell functions
by stimulating the transcription of a subset of genes.63 In hepatocytes, it has been shown that the interaction
with ECM can promote albumin production. Therefore, we selected albumin
secretion as one of the major functions of Huh 7.5 and measured its
production on cells plated on the SLB and glass platforms. Figures 5c shows the average
amount of albumin produced by each cell after 24 h. On average, cells
grown on the SLB platforms produced more albumin than that of those
grown on glass-based surfaces.

Conclusions
The adsorption behavior
and biological activity of Col I and FN
attached to SLB via covalent bonding were compared with those of Col
I and FN adsorbed nonspecifically to SiO2 surfaces. The
characterization of protein adsorption by QCM-D revealed that Col
I and FN attached to SLB have a higher structural flexibility than
those adsorbed onto SiO2. The QCM-D study also showed that
the interaction of FN with Col I is more efficient on SLB than on
SiO2, suggesting that the Col I–FN interaction on
the SiO2 surface may be inhibited by limited accessible
binding sites on the surface-adsorbed Col I. In addition, the ratio
of the number of cells attached to protein-coated SLB and SiO2 to the amount of adsorbed protein revealed that the interaction
of cells with the anchorage sites for cell adhesion on FN and Col
I is more efficient on SLB than on SiO2. The same trend
was observed for cell proliferation and albumin production by cells
attached to the functionalized SLB and SiO2. Taken together,
our results show that Col I and FN attached to SLB via covalent bonding
retain their biological activities better than when attached on glass.
Thus, SLB functionalization can serve as an effective strategy to
interface biological molecules to inorganic surfaces. The benefit
of this platform is expected to be more pronounced when smaller protein/peptide
motifs are needed to be used for functionalization.

Lipid (Alabaster, AL). Isopropanol and ethanol were used to dissolve
DOPC and DP-NGPE to a concentration of 10 and 5 mg/mL, respectively.
The DP-NGPE solution was gently vortexed and heated to 50 °C
for 3 min, to enhance the solubility. All of the stock solutions were
diluted and mixed in isopropanol to prepare a lipid solution containing
80% DOPC and 20% DP-NGPE to a final concentration of 0.5 mg/mL. Lipid
bilayers were formed using the SALB method, whereby an isopropanol
mixture of DOPC and DP-NGPE was introduced to a hydrophilic SiO2/glass substrate and was incubated for 10 min. A buffer solution
(10 mM Tris, 100 mM NaCl, pH 7.2) was carefully added and replaced
with the isopropanol mixture of lipids.

Activating Carboxyl Groups
of DP-NGPE Lipid Using EDC/NHS Chemistry
N-Hydroxysulfosuccinimide sodium (sNHS) and EDC
hydrochloride were received from VWR. Immediately before the experiment,
EDC/NHS powders were dissolved in 10 mM HEPES buffer and 100 mM NaCl
(pH 5.5) at a final concentration of 10 mg/mL. The solution was incubated
with SLBs for 1 h at room temperature. After carboxylic activation,
the SLBs were washed three times with a HEPES solution.

Functionalization
of SLB and Glass/SiO2 with ECM
Proteins
The proteins, Col I (Sigma-Aldrich) and FN (Calbiochem,
U.K.), were diluted in PBS (pH 7.5) at a concentration of 0.2 mg/mL.
The protein solutions were added to an activated SLB and glass for
1.5 h using a peristaltic pump (Ismatec Reglo Digital) with a flow
rate of 50 μL/min. The surface was then rinsed thoroughly with
PBS to remove unbound proteins.

QCM-D
The formation
of a lipid bilayer and binding
of proteins to the lipid interface was monitored and characterized
by a Q-Sense E4 instrument (Q-sense AB, Gothenburg, Sweden). SiO2-coated AT-cut piezoelectric quartz crystals were cleaned
with 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate and rinsed with Milli-Q water (Millipore).
The crystals were dried with N2 and treated with oxygen
plasma (March Plasmod Plasma Etcher, March Instruments, CA) at 180
W for 30 s to remove any residual organic molecules bound to the surface
while making the substrate more hydrophilic. QCM-D measurements were
taken at the 3, 5, 7, and 11 overtones, and the presented data were
measured and normalized at the third overtone (15 MHz). The samples
were injected into the QCM-D chamber using a peristaltic pump (Ismatec
Reglo Digital) with a flow rate of 50 μL/min at room temperature.

FRAP
Lateral lipid mobility was estimated using the
FRAP technique. 1,2-Dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-(lissamine rhodamine B sulfonyl) (ammonium salt) (Rh-PE)
(Avanti Polar Lipid) (0.5 wt %) was included in the lipid precursor
solution to fluorescently label the lipid bilayers. A commercially
available flow chamber (stick-Slide I0.1 Luer, Ibidi, Munich, Germany)
was used for bilayer formation using the SALB method. The SLBs were
photobleached using a 532 nm, 100 mW laser beam that resulted in the
formation of a ∼20 μm bleached spot. The bleaching period
was ∼5 s, and the fluorescence recovery of the bilayer was
measured using an inverted epifluorescence Eclipse TE 2000 microscope
(Nikon) equipped with a 60× oil immersion objective (NA 1.49)
combined with an Andor iXon + EMCCD camera (Andor Technology, Belfast,
Northern Ireland). The images were recorded at 2 s intervals and analyzed
using ImageJ software. The lipid diffusivity was determined by the
Hankel transform method.64 For all fluorescence
imaging experiments, glass coverslips (Menzel Glaser, Braunschweig,
Germany) were used.

Cell Culture
The human hepatocarcinoma
cell line (Huh
7.5) was obtained from Apath (NY). Cells were plated on a tissue culture
dish (100 mm) containing 10 mL of Dulbecco’s Modified Eagles
Medium (DMEM) (Hyclone), 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone), 1% penicillin,
and streptomycin (Gibco) for several days to reach a confluency of
80%. Cells were detached from the plate by incubating the culture
dish with 0.25% trypsin (Gibco) for ∼3–5 min. After
the cell suspension was dispersed in the growth medium, the cell count
of 2 × 104 was determined via a hemocytometer. A flow
chamber (Sticky-Slide VI 0.4 Ibidi, Munich, Germany) was used for
cell seeding. The cell growth area per channel was ∼0.6 cm2.

Evaluation of Huh 7.5 Cell Morphology
Cell morphology
was visualized over a period of 24 h, wherein Huh 7.5 cells were fixed
using 4% paraformaldehyde (Sigma) for 3 min. After washing with PBS
three times, a 3% BSA blocking buffer was added and incubated for
1 h. Alexa Flour 555-labeled phalloidin (Life Technologies) was incubated
with cells for 2 h at room temperature, to label filamentous actin
(F-actin). The nucleus of each cell was labeled by addition of 10
μg/mL of 1,2,6-diamidino-2-phenylinodole, dihydrochloride (DAPI;
Life Technologies) for 5 min. The fluorescence images were captured
using a confocal microscope, LSM710 with a ZEN program (Carl Zeiss),
and were analyzed using ImageJ software.

Quantification of Huh 7.5
Cell Surface Area
The optical
images of Huh 7.5 cells were captured after 24 h using an inverted
microscope (Nikon) with a 10× objective. The cell surface area
was measured and analyzed using ImageJ software.

Determination
of Cell Viability by LIVE/DEAD Kit
The
qualitative investigation of Huh 7.5 cell viability was done using
LIVE/DEAD Cell Viability assays (Life Technologies), following the
manufacturer’s protocol. The proper volume of 2 μM calcein
AM and 4 μM ethdium homodimer-1 (EthD-1) was prepared in DMEM
media. The solution was added to each sample and incubated for 20
min at 37 °C. After incubation, the trapped calcein inside the
living cells yielded a strong green fluorescence and was imaged using
a 494–517 nm emission filter. For dead cells, EthD-1 was bonded
with the nucleic acids inside the cell and produced a red fluorescence
that was imaged using a 517–617 nm emission filter. An Eclipse
TI-U microscope combined with an NIS-Elements Viewer program (Nikon,
Japan) was used for fluorescence measurements.

Determination
of Cell Number by Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8)
Cell proliferation
for days 1 and 3 was measured using a colorimetric
assay CCK-8 (Dojindo Molecular Technologies, Japan). Based on the
manufacturer’s protocol, a 10% CCK-8 reagent in complete media
was added to the cells. After incubation for 1 h at 37 °C, the
absorbance was measured at 450 nm using a microplate reader. The measured
absorbance was converted to cell number according to a CCK-8 standard
curve for Huh 7.5.

Determination of Human Albumin in Cell Culture
Supernatants
Albumin secretions from the Huh 7.5 cells were
measured using an
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit (Abcam). The cell culture
media was collected after 24 h and was centrifuged at 10 000g for 10 min. The supernatant was transferred to a sterile
Eppendorf tube and stored at −20 °C. Before the ELISA,
the samples were kept at room temperature and the provided protocols
were subsequently followed.

Immunofluorescent Stain for ECM Proteins
The primary
antibodies, mouse monoclonal anti-Col I (Abcam) and mouse monoclonal
IgG1 anti-FN (Santa Cruz), were incubated with conjugated Col I and
FN, respectively, for 1 h at room temperature. The samples were then
washed with PBS to remove unbounded antibodies. After washing, the
secondary antibodies Alexa Fluor 488 Goat Anti-mouse IgG (H + L) (green-fluorescent
dye, Life Technology) and Alexa Fluor 555 Rabbit Anti-Mouse IgG (H
+ L) (red-fluorescent dye, Life Technology) were added and incubated
for 15 min to fluorescently label Col I and FN, respectively. Fluorescence
images were captured with an inverted epifluorescence Eclipse TE 2000
microscope (Nikon) equipped with a 60× oil immersion objective
(NA 1.49) combined with an Andor iXon + EMCCD camera (Andor Technology,
Belfast, Northern Ireland). The data were analyzed using ImageJ software.
