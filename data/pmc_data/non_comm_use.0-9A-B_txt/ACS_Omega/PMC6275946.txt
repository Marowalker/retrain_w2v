Difficulties
in developing active-site-directed protein tyrosine
phosphatase (PTP) inhibitors have led to the perception that PTPs
are “undruggable”, highlighting the need for new means
to target pharmaceutically important PTPs allosterically. Recently,
we characterized an allosteric-inhibition site on the PTP domain of
Src-homology-2-domain-containing PTP 2 (SHP2), a key anticancer drug
target. The central feature of SHP2’s allosteric site is a
nonconserved cysteine residue (C333) that can potentially be labeled
with electrophilic compounds for selective SHP2 inhibition. Here,
we describe the first directed discovery effort for C333-targeted
allosteric SHP2 inhibitors. By screening a previously reported library
of reversible, covalent inhibitors, we identified a lead compound,
which was modified to yield an irreversible inhibitor (12), that inhibits SHP2 allosterically and selectively through interaction
with C333. These findings provide a novel paradigm for allosteric-inhibitor
discovery on SHP2, one that may help to circumvent the challenges
inherent in targeting SHP2’s active site.

Introduction
Protein tyrosine phosphatases
(PTPs) catalyze the dephosphorylation
of phosphotyrosine, a critical control element in mammalian signal
transduction,1 and misregulation of PTP
activity has been implicated in a range of human pathologies, including
cancer, diabetes, and autoimmune disorders.2−6 Src-homology-2-domain-containing PTP 2 (SHP2) provides
a particularly strong example of the connection between improperly
regulated PTP activity and human disease: SHP2 mutations cause Noonan
and LEOPARD syndromes, and mutations that increase SHP2’s basal
PTP activity are the most common cause of sporadic juvenile myelomonocytic
leukemia.7 SHP2 activity also has been
strongly implicated in oncogenesis even in instances in which the
enzyme does not itself harbor mutations.8−11 Therefore, SHP2 has emerged as
a bona fide anticancer target for inhibitor discovery, and compounds
that can effectively target either (or both) the wild-type enzyme
and its improperly activated variants hold significant therapeutic
potential.

PTPs, including SHP2, however, have proven notoriously
difficult
to drug. Active-site-directed PTP inhibitors often display limited
selectivity, owing to the high degree of sequence and structural homology
in PTP active sites.12 Bioavailability
is also a major hurdle, as the potencies of many active-site-directed
compounds are dependent on negatively charged phosphotyrosine-mimetic
pharmacophores that hinder cell permeability.13 The specific challenges inherent in identifying target-specific
and bioactive SHP2 inhibitors have been further highlighted by a recent
study, which showed that several previously reported compounds, some
of which have been widely used in the SHP2-signaling literature, either
(i) fail to inhibit SHP2 in a cellular context or (ii) induce non-SHP2-mediated
signaling effects that are likely the result of off-target protein-kinase
inhibition.14

Allosteric inhibition
represents an attractive approach for circumventing
the difficulties that have limited successful development of active-site-directed
SHP2 inhibitors for two key reasons: allosteric sites are typically
much less strongly conserved than PTP active sites and allosteric
sites do not necessarily privilege charged pharmacophores.15,16 In principle, allosteric PTP inhibition could be achieved either
through engagement with a site on the PTP domain or by targeting a
regulatory site beyond the PTP domain.17 For SHP2, noteworthy success on the latter front has been realized
through the development of compounds that stabilize an autoinhibitory
interaction between SHP2’s SH2 domains and its PTP domain.18 Although small-molecule stabilizers of SHP2’s
autoinhibition (e.g., SHP099) hold enormous promise for targeting
cancers in which SHP2 activity is implicated,19,20 the potency of such compounds can be strongly attenuated by cancer-associated
gain-of-function mutations that disrupt the integrity of the autoinhibitory
interaction.21 Compounds that can inhibit
PTP activity at an allosteric site directly on SHP2’s PTP domain
would provide an alternate mode of allosteric SHP2 targeting that
is likely to remain functional regardless of the strength of the SH2/PTP
domain interaction in the particular SHP2 variant that is targeted
therapeutically.

We have previously demonstrated that the SHP2
catalytic domain
contains an allosteric-inhibition site that is not present in most
other PTPs and that renders the enzyme sensitive to selective inhibition.22 This finding stemmed from an unexpected observation
that SHP2 is inhibited by a biarsenical compound, FlAsH-EDT2,23,24 which does not inhibit other PTPs.25 It was further shown that the FlAsH-EDT2 sensitivity of SHP2’s allosteric site is dependent
on the presence of a nonconserved cysteine residue (C333) that lies
outside of the active site (Figure 1A,B).22 Importantly, SHP2’s
unusual sensitivity to FlAsH-EDT2 is completely removed
by mutation of C333 to proline,25 the amino
acid that occupies the analogous position in most classical PTPs (Figure 1B).26 C333, therefore, represents the key selectivity determinant
of a nonconserved inhibitory site that may provide a new means for
targeting the SHP2 catalytic domain allosterically and with high selectivity.

Figure 1 C333 is
rare within classical PTP domains and lies outside of SHP2’s
active site. (A) Three-dimensional structure of SHP2’s catalytic
domain (PDB ID: 3B7O).27 SHP2 is shown as a magenta ribbon,
with the conserved active-site motif highlighted in green. The side
chains of C333 and the active-site cysteine, C459, are shown and colored
by atom type. (B) Sequence alignment of motif 4 (as assigned by Andersen
et al.26) of the PTPs discussed in this
study. 34 of 37 classical human PTP domains contain proline at position
333, 1 PTP has serine (not shown), and only 2, SHP2 and SHP1, have
cysteine.

Although it was previously shown
that SHP2 can be selectively inhibited
via its PTP-domain allosteric site, the biarsenical compound with
which this discovery was made is, on its face, not viable as a lead
for development of SHP2-directed therapeutics. FlAsH-EDT2 has been previously shown to associate with a significant number
of cysteine-rich proteins nonspecifically28 and would be expected to present significant toxicity due to its
arsenic atoms.29

In the current study,
we identify the first druglike compounds
that can bind to SHP2’s C333-containing allosteric site and
inhibit the enzyme allosterically and selectively. To do so, we investigated
compounds that contain two key elements: a “druglike”
component that could potentially drive noncovalent binding interactions
in the pocket surrounding C333 and an electrophilic component capable
of reacting covalently with the nucleophilic C333, once the compound
is noncovalently bound. The targeted discovery of compounds that covalently
react with C333, and avoid reaction with conserved cysteines within
the PTP domain, may represent an important new strategy for specific
allosteric inhibition of SHP2.

Results and Discussion
To identify
compounds that can allosterically inhibit SHP2 through
a novel mechanism of action, we synthesized compound panel 1–8 (Figure 2A), a small library of cyanoacrylamides that was previously
used to identify protein-kinase inhibitors that act via covalent interaction
with a nonconserved cysteine residue in the kinase domain.30 We hypothesized that the compound panel could
be remined with SHP2 (a member of a different enzyme family, the PTPs)
to possibly yield lead compounds capable of inhibition through targeting
the nonconserved cysteine C333. Because PTPs also contain a highly
conserved cysteine residue that is necessary for catalytic activity
(C459 in SHP2, one of two conserved cysteines in classical PTPs, vide
infra), we screened compounds 1–8 both for inhibition of the wild-type SHP2 PTP domain and for selectivity
against a SHP2 mutant, in which C333 is replaced with proline (C333P
SHP2). A compound that selectively inhibits SHP2 over C333P SHP2 is
likely to act at SHP2’s allosteric site, as the 333 position
contains the only molecular difference between the two enzymes. Moreover,
a compound that can target SHP2 over C333P SHP2 could be reasonably
hypothesized to show selectivity over many other PTPs, as the vast
majority of human classical PTPs (35 of 37) do not contain cysteine
at the homologous position in their respective catalytic domains.26

Figure 2 Screen for C333-directed allosteric SHP2 inhibitors. (A)
Chemical
structures of 1–11. Compounds 1–8 were reported previously by Miller
et al.30 as putative protein-kinase inhibitors.
(B) PTP activities of the SHP2 and C333P SHP2 catalytic domains (800
nM) were measured with para-nitrophenyl phosphate
(pNPP, 4 mM) after preincubation with the indicated
inhibitors (300 μM, 2 h, 23 °C). (C) PTP activities of
the SHP2 and C333P SHP2 catalytic domains (800 nM) were measured with pNPP (4 mM) after preincubation with the indicated inhibitors
(50 μM, 2 h, 37 °C).

Our compound screen revealed, unsurprisingly, that most of
the
compounds in the small panel did not demonstrate selective inhibition
of the wild-type SHP2 PTP domain over the C333P mutant (Figure 2B). However, two compounds
(4 and 7) showed some selectivity for the
wild-type enzyme, with 4 being the more active of the
two. Interestingly, the relative placement of 4’s
cyanoacrylamide moiety and the nitrogen atom in its quinoline ring
system appears to be critical for activity, as isomer 3 showed very little activity on SHP2 (Figure 2A,B). To further test the importance of the
presence and/or placement of 4’s quinoline nitrogen
atom, we synthesized compounds 9–11 which either lack the nitrogen atom (9, Figure 2A) or have the nitrogen atom
in a different location within the heteroaromatic ring system (10 and 11, Figure 2A). We found that the 4-substituted quinoline pharmacophore
of compound 4 was necessary for activity, as 9–11 showed no selective inhibition of wild-type
SHP2 under the screening conditions (Figure 2C).

The electrophilic cyanoacrylamide
functional group of compounds 1–11 has previously been shown to react
reversibly with cysteine residues.30,31 Although reversible
covalent inhibitors have been fruitfully used to target nonconserved
cysteine residues in the protein-kinase superfamily,32 we were interested in developing an irreversible analogue
of 4, which would potentially enable the unambiguous
mapping of the interaction between SHP2 and the 4-quinoline pharmacophore.
To develop an irreversible inhibitor that retains the lead compound’s
SHP2-binding properties, we explored derivatives of 4, in which the 4-quinoline pharmacophore was unchanged, but the compound’s
cyanoacrylamide was replaced with electrophiles that could potentially
react irreversibly with C333 of SHP2.

Notably, we found that
compound 12 (Figure 3A), in which the cyanoacrylamide
is replaced with an acrylamide, not only retained the inhibitory activity
of compound 4 against SHP2, but it demonstrated increased
potency (Figure 3B),
whereas some measurable SHP2 activity remained after pre-incubation
with 300 μM 4 (Figure 2B), essentially all SHP2 activity was abolished
in the presence of 150 μM
compound 12 (Figure 3B). Inhibition by 12 was shown to be dose-dependent,
and we estimated a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50)
of approximately 35 μM with the wild-type SHP2 PTP domain. Importantly,
compound 12 retains the specificity of 4 against C333P SHP2, showing little to no significant inhibition
of the mutant enzyme, even at the highest compound concentration assayed
(150 μM, Figure 3B). In addition, the IC50 of compound 12 on
wild-type SHP2 is not affected by the addition of detergent, further
suggesting that the compound does not act through nonspecific enzyme
aggregation (Figure S1, Supporting Information).33

Figure 3 Compound 12 is a C333-targeted, time-dependent
SHP2
inhibitor. (A) Chemical structure of 12. (B) Dose dependence
of inhibition by 12. PTP activities of the SHP2 and C333P
SHP2 catalytic domains (250 nM) were measured with pNPP (5 mM) after preincubation (2 h, 37 °C) with vehicle or 12 at the indicated concentrations. (C) Time dependence of
inhibition by 12. PTP activities of the SHP2 and C333P
SHP2 catalytic domains (250 nM) were measured with pNPP (5 mM) after preincubation with vehicle or 12 (150
μM) for the indicated times at 37 °C. (D) Kinetic analysis
of SHP2 inhibition. Time-dependent inhibition assays were carried
out essentially as described for panel (C) to determine the half-life
(t1/2) of PTP activity at various concentrations
of 12. The linear relationship between t1/2 and the reciprocal of inhibitor concentration (1/[12]) was analyzed to estimate the indicated kinetic constants
as previously described.34,35

Because compound 12 was designed as a cysteine-targeting
covalent inhibitor, we next sought to investigate whether it acts
in a time-dependent manner. We found that, indeed, the degree of SHP2
inhibition at a fixed concentration of 12 (150 μM)
is highly dependent on the time of preincubation (Figure 3C). In agreement with the dose-dependence
experiments (Figure 3B), C333P SHP2 was not significantly inhibited by 12 regardless of the duration of the preincubation (Figure 3C). Interestingly, a mutant
of SHP2, in which C333 has been replaced with alanine (C333A SHP2),
shows attenuated, yet still significant, time-dependent inhibition
by 12 (Figure S2, Supporting
Information), suggesting that covalent bond formation between C333
and 12’s acrylamide moiety is not strictly rate
limiting for SHP2 inhibition. It may be that a conformational change
that is necessary for inhibition of wild-type (or C333A) SHP2 is precluded
in the rigidified C333P mutant.22 Regardless
of the precise mechanism of inhibition, the time- and concentration-dependence
of SHP2 inhibition were investigated more quantitatively to estimate
the kinetics of inhibition, yielding an inactivation constant (kinact) of 0.021 min–1 and
an inhibition constant (KI) of 279 μM
(Figure 3D) for 12 on SHP2.

We next sought to directly assess which,
if any, of SHP2’s
catalytic-domain cysteine residues are labeled in the presence of
compound 12. It is important to note that PTP domains
contain two highly conserved cysteine residues (C367 and C459 in human
SHP2 numbering),26 and that reagents that
inhibit PTP activity through covalent reaction with these conserved
cysteines have been developed previously.16,36,37 Compounds that label C367 and C459 (and
the homologous cysteines in other PTPs), however, are generally not
selective, as their mechanisms of action rely on conserved elements
within the PTP domain.

To test if allosteric inhibitor 12 is capable of inactivating
SHP2 without labeling its conserved PTP-domain cysteines, we performed
liquid-chromatographic tandem-mass-spectrometric analysis (LC-MS/MS)
on SHP2 after incubation with the compound (50 μM, 3 h). Consistent
with the previous observation that C333P SHP2 (which contains both
C367 and C459) is resistant to inhibition by 12, LC-MS/MS
revealed that these conserved residues do not form covalent adducts
with 12 to any appreciable degree (Figure 4 and Tables S1 and S2, Supporting Information). We observed either no or almost no detectable
(<0.25%) labeling of SHP2’s conserved cysteines in both
SHP2 and C333P SHP2. By contrast, we observed approximately 20% labeling
of C333 in SHP2, even though this cysteine residue is buried in SHP2
crystal structures. These findings are consistent with a “cryptic-allosteric-site”
hypothesis, which posits that a conformational change is necessary
to expose the C333 sidechain to solvent for allosteric inhibition
to occur.22

Figure 4 Compound 12 irreversibly labels C333, but not the
conserved cysteines C367 and C459, in the SHP2 catalytic domain. After
preincubation of SHP2 or C333P SHP2 with 12 (50 μM,
3 h), the degree of labeling at the indicated cysteine residues was
determined by LC-MS/MS.

In addition to C333, 12 did also label other
nonconserved
cysteine residues (C259, C318, and C486) that are surface-exposed
and/or positioned on loops (Tables S1 and S2). These labeling events presumably have no significant effects on
SHP2 activity, as they occur in both the wild-type and C333P enzymes
upon treatment with 12 (Tables S1 and S2). The off-target labeling caused by 12,
coupled with its modest kinetics of inactivation (Figure 3D), underscore the need for
further efforts focused toward the discovery of compounds that can
target the SHP2 allosteric site with greater target potency, specificity,
and rapidity. Nevertheless, compound 12’s demonstrated
ability to engage C333 over SHP2’s conserved cysteines represents
a key proof of principle for targeting SHP2’s allosteric site
with covalent inhibitors.

The significance of the data presented
above depends on a key assumption
that selectivity for wild-type over C333P SHP2 is a useful proxy for
selectivity against other PTP domains that contain proline at the
position homologous to 333. To test the validity of this assumption
directly, we expressed and purified the catalytic domains of four
other PTPs, three that possess the consensus amino acid proline at
position 333 (PTP1B, hematopoietic protein tyrosine phosphatase (HePTP),
density-enhanced phosphatase 1 (DEP1)), as well as the one other PTP
that has a cysteine at the equivalent position, SHP1 (Figure 1B). We then assayed the activities
of all of the PTP domains after incubation with compound 12, under conditions that give strong inhibition of SHP2’s catalytic
domain (Figure 5).
We found, without exception, that PTP domains that contain proline
at position 333 are resistant to compound 12, whereas
the only two human PTPs that have cysteine at this position, SHP2
and SHP1, are sensitive to inhibition (Figure 5). These results confirm that the presence
or absence of proline at position 333 is a strong determinant for
the efficacy of compound 12. Moreover, because almost
all human PTPs contain proline at this position, our data suggest
that most PTPs will also be resistant to 12. It is also
reasonable to infer that other yet-to-be-discovered compounds that
can effectively engage C333 in the context of SHP2’s PTP-domain
allosteric site will show similar levels of selectivity.

Figure 5 Residue 333
is a strong determinant of sensitivity to 12 in multiple
PTP domains. Activities of the indicated PTP domains
(800 nM) were measured with pNPP (4 mM) in the absence
(vehicle only) or presence of compound 12 (50 μM)
after a 4 h incubation at 37 °C.

SHP2’s catalytic domain is widely used in inhibitor-discovery
efforts, including the studies presented above.8 The isolated PTP domain is used largely for the purpose
of experimental efficiency, as full-length SHP2 possesses strongly
attenuated in vitro PTP activity due to the presence of the enzyme’s
autoinhibitory SH2 domains.38,39 Nevertheless, for a
small-molecule SHP2 inhibitor to be useful, it must of course be able
to engage its target site in the context of the full-length protein.

To test whether compound 12 is capable of targeting
SHP2’s allosteric site in the presence of the enzyme’s
SH2 domains, we expressed a full-length construct (fl-SHP2, comprising
residues 1–541, lacking only the disordered C-terminal tail)
and assayed its sensitivity to inhibition by 12. In agreement
with the results on the SHP2 catalytic domain, we found that 12 induces strong and dose-dependent inhibition of fl-SHP2
(Figure 6). Importantly,
fl-SHP2’s sensitivity to 12 is eliminated by mutation
of cysteine 333 to proline (fl-C333P SHP2). These results suggest
that 12’s mechanisms of inhibition on the SHP2
PTP domain and fl-SHP2 are identical, i.e., that the compound inhibits
allosterically through direct engagement of C333, either in the context
of the PTP domain or the full-length enzyme.

Figure 6 Compound 12 inhibits fl-SHP2, but not fl-C333P SHP2.
PTP activities of the indicated enzymes (250 nM) were measured with
6,8-difluoro-4-methylumbelliferyl phosphate (DiFMUP) (50 μM)
in the absence (vehicle only) or presence of the indicated concentrations
of compound 12 after a 2 h incubation at 37 °C (the
reduced activity of fl-SHP2, as compared to the SHP2 PTP domain, necessitated
a switch of substrate to DiFMUP, a small-molecule PTP substrate that
is more efficient than pNPP).

Conclusions
Collectively, our findings establish that a
nonconserved allosteric
site on the catalytic domain of the oncogenic PTP SHP2 can be targeted
for selective inhibition with druglike small molecules. Moreover,
our study validates the strategy of counter-screening putative SHP2
inhibitors against C333P SHP2 as an efficient means to identify allosteric
SHP2 inhibitors. Despite assaying only a small panel of compounds,
we identified a selective, C333-targeted inhibitor (12), using inactivity on C333P SHP2 as a key criterion for further
investigation. It must be noted that significant challenges remain
for future studies that target SHP2’s PTP-domain allosteric
site. Compound 12’s modest potency and inhibition
kinetics, as well its lack of selectivity over SHP1, are significant
obstacles that will no doubt require larger screens of cysteine-reactive
compound libraries to overcome. Given the demonstrated targetability
of SHP2’s nonconserved allosteric site, as well as the importance
of allosteric SHP2 inhibitors in anticancer pharmaceutical development,
C333-directed compound screens may constitute an important new tool
for PTP-targeted drug discovery.

Materials and Methods
General
“PTP activity (%)” is defined
as the initial velocity of a PTP reaction in the presence of an inhibitor
divided by the initial velocity of a vehicle-only control, which is
defined as 100% activity. Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) (5% v/v in the
assay) was the vehicle in all inhibition experiments. Error bars and
“±” values represent the standard deviations of
three independent measurements.

Cloning and Mutagenesis
of PTP-Encoding Genes
Plasmids
encoding His6-tagged constructs of human SHP2 catalytic
domain, human PTP1B catalytic domain, human DEP1 catalytic domain,
and human full-length SHP2 (1–541) were purchased from VectorBuilder
(Cyagen Biosciences Inc). The plasmid encoding the His6-tagged catalytic domain of HePTP has been described previously.25 Site-directed mutations were introduced using
the Quikchange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Desired mutations were confirmed by sequencing.

Protein
Expression and Purification
All PTP catalytic
domains were expressed as His6-tagged constructs and purified
using HisPur Ni-NTA resin (Thermo Scientific) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions and as previously described.22,25 After purification, proteins were exchanged into storage buffer
(50 mM 3,3-dimethyl glutarate at pH 7.0, 1 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic
acid (EDTA), 1 mM tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine, concentrated, flash-frozen
in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C). Bradford assays
were used to measure enzyme concentrations, and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide
gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) was used to assess purity.

Phosphatase
Activity Assay Using pNPP as Substrate
Quenched
PTP assays using pNPP as substrate were
carried out in a total volume of 200 μL, containing PTP buffer
(50 mM 3,3-dimethyl glutarate at pH 7.0, 1 mM EDTA, 50 mM NaCl), enzyme
(varying concentrations: see figure legends), 5% DMSO or inhibitor
in DMSO solution (varying concentrations: see figure legends), and pNPP (added after varying preincubation times and at varying
concentrations and temperatures: see figure legends). PTP reactions
were quenched by the addition of 40 μL of 5 M NaOH, and the
absorbances (405 nm) of 200 μL of the resulting solutions were
measured.

Phosphatase Activity Assay Using DiFMUP as Substrate
After preincubations of varying times at 37 °C (see figures),
PTP reactions were started by the addition of DiFMUP (50 μM)
to solutions containing PTP buffer (see above), enzyme (250 nM), inhibitor
(at varying concentrations) or DMSO (5%). The sample was excited (360
nm) and fluorescence (450 nm) of the resulting 200 μL solutions
were measured continuously for 1 min. The slopes of the lines deriving
from inhibitor-treated enzyme were compared to the corresponding DMSO
controls.

Mass Spectrometry
Purified SHP2 or C333P SHP2 at 1
mg/mL was incubated with compound 12 (50 μM) for
3 h at 37 °C in PTP buffer. After the incubation, the 250 μL
solution was added to 50 μL of HisPur Ni-NTA resin. The suspension
was mixed well, and the beads were subsequently washed three times
with 500 μL of cold PTP buffer. The His-tagged PTP was eluted
with 50 μL of elution buffer (50 mM Tris pH 7.8, 500 mM NaCl,
250 mM imidazole). Eluent (18.75 μL) was purified by SDS-PAGE.
The gel was then stained with Coomassie brilliant blue G-250, and
the SHP2 bands were excised. Contents of the excised gel bands were
identified by LC-MS/MS, as previously described.22,40

(12)
To a solution of 4-aminoquinoline (0.2986
g, 2.06 mmol)
in anhydrous THF (25 mL) was added acryloyl chloride (0.3343 g, 3.69
mmol) dissolved in anhydrous THF (5 mL). The reaction mixture was
stirred under nitrogen at 0 °C for 3 h, quenched with aqueous
sodium bicarbonate, and extracted with ethyl acetate three times.
