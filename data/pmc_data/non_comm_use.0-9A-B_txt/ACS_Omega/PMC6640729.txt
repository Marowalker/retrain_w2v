The
traditional Japanese overglaze ceramic, akae porcelain,
typically known for Kakiemon-style wares, has been prized
around the world for over 400 years. The red color of akae porcelain provides an attractive contrast to white porcelain. In
recent years, because the use of leaded frit in making akae has been restricted by law owing to the effects of lead on human
health and the environment, lead-free glass frit mixtures for overglaze
ceramic wares have been developed in various porcelain production
areas throughout Japan. However, current lead-free frit for red overglaze
enamels produces a color that is duller than that of conventional
leaded frit. Therefore, the development of red pigments that are suitable
for use with lead-free frit is strongly desired. In this study, we
used a hydrothermal process to prepare nanosized iron oxide and oxyhydroxide
powders, which showed good particle dispersion in molten lead-free
frit. The precursor paste was prepared by reacting iron nitrate with
ammonium hydrogen carbonate and heated in a sealed vessel at 80–150
°C. The sample powder prepared at 90 °C was almost monophasic
α-Fe2O3 (hematite) and exhibited the brightest
red color (highest L*, a*, and b* values). This powder featured primary particles of ∼15
nm in diameter that aggregated to form secondary spherical particles
of ∼100 nm in diameter. This powder was mixed with lead-free
frit and applied as a red paint to a porcelain test piece. The resultant akae showed a bright red color with high L*, a*, and b* values that exceeded
the values of akae prepared using conventional hematite
powder. Microscopic analysis revealed that the hematite particles
were well dispersed in the resultant glass layer, indicating that
the hematite powders have good dispersibility in molten frit.

==== Body
Introduction
α-Fe2O3 (hematite)
is one of the oldest
known red pigments used by humans since prehistoric time. Recently,
hematite has
attracted much attention in the field of nanotechnology because of
its potential to be used as catalysts, gas-sensing materials, anode
materials for lithium-ion batteries, and photoanode materials for
photoelectrochemical water-splitting reactions.1−8 Widespread contemporary research on hematite red pigments has focused
on the nanostructure of hematite, yielding novel red pigments with
high chemical and/or thermal stabilities.9−20 The color tone of hematite powder strongly depends on its particle
size and dispersibility. The color can range from bright yellowish
red for small and/or well-dispersed particles to dark gray for large
and/or strongly aggregated particles.21 Here, we define “bright”, “good”, or
“high-quality” red colors as those having high L*, a*, and b* values
and similar a* and b* values in
the CIE 1976 color space.22

Traditional
Japanese red overglaze ceramic ware, akae, was developed
in the early 17th century and is admired by porcelain
lovers around the world. Kakiemon-style ware was first exported to
Europe in the 17th and 18th centuries. These porcelain wares were
highly regarded by royalty and the aristocracy at that time, which
significantly influenced the production of porcelain for overseas
markets.23,24 Today, porcelain producers around the world
use akae techniques for a variety of purposes. Traditionally,
Japanese akae porcelain is produced as follows.25,26 First, red paint is prepared by mixing a low-melting-point glass
frit powder, 10–25 wt % hematite red pigment, and a solvent
in a wet process. The red paint is then applied to a white porcelain
body; the painted porcelain is dried and finally heated at 700–900
°C in air. The obtained overglaze enamel is a composite of hematite
particles and glass, which has come to be known as akae.

Although leaded glass frit with low melting points is conventionally
used in traditional akae porcelain, the use of glass
frit containing lead is now regulated owing to concerns for human
health and the environment. In addition, the high-quality red pigment
Fukiya bengala,20,27−31 which had the largest market share in Japan, went
out of use when antipollution laws came into effect in the 1970s.
The porcelain industry has since been seeking new lead-free frit and
high-quality hematite pigments. We have previously developed lead-free
frit mixtures for Kyo and Kiyomizu wares and provided these frit mixtures
to many porcelain producers.26,32 We have also developed
thermostable hematite powders, inspired by the historical pigment,
Fukiya bengala.20 Recently, we studied
the optimal preparation process for high-quality red paint using lead-free
frit and conventional hematite powder.26 Our results indicated that high-quality akae requires
hematite particles to exist in the interspaces of frit particles with
a low degree of aggregation among the hematite particles. However,
primary hematite particles tend to aggregate into larger secondary
particles in hematite powders prepared through conventional dry heating
processes. This makes it difficult to achieve a good dispersion of
primary hematite particles in red paint mixtures and the final akae glass layer. Here, we prepared nanosized iron oxide
and oxyhydroxide powders through a hydrothermal treatment, which produced
well-dispersed hematite particles in red paint and molten lead-free
frit. In addition, we made high-quality akae test
pieces based on the prepared powders.

Experimental Section
A precursor sample was prepared based on a method modified from
that of Smith et al.33 First, 0.025 mol
Fe(NO3)3·9H2O (Wako Pure Chemical
Industries, 99.9%) was crushed to a fine powder using an alumina mortar
and pestle. Then, 0.3 mol NH4HCO3 (Wako Pure
Chemical Industries) was added to the powder and mixed using the pestle
to form a thick red ocher paste. Then, one-third of this precursor
paste was moved to a polytetrafluoroethylene vessel to which 15 mL
of deionized water was added. The vessel was sealed, locked in a stainless-steel
container, and heated at 70, 80, 85, 90, 120, and 150 °C for
24 h. The process above was repeated for each temperature. Each slurry
sample was washed with ∼40 mL of deionized water and ∼12
mL of ethanol before drying at 80 °C overnight. The crystallographic
structures, reflectance spectra and colors, and microstructures of
the obtained powder samples were characterized using X-ray diffractometry
(XRD, RINT2500VHF, Rigaku), spectrophotometry (CM-5, Konica Minolta
Sensing), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM, JSM-6701F, JEOL),
respectively. The colors of the powders were determined against the
CIE standard illuminant D65. The samples heated at 90,
120, and 150 °C were mixed with lead-free frit (Kyo Muen Daigusuri;
Kyoto Iwasaki), having a median particle diameter of 1.2 μm,
and a water-based solvent. Each slurry sample was painted on a white
porcelain test piece, which was then heated at 780 °C for 5 min
in air at a rate of 2.5 °C/min. The sample was then allowed to
cool to room temperature in the furnace. The obtained red overglaze
enamel samples were characterized by spectrophotometry and light microscopy
(BX51M, Olympus) in dark-field mode. We used our previously synthesized
hematite powder composed of particles of 40–140 nm in diameter
as a reference sample.20 Briefly, this
sample was prepared by a polymer complex method using Fe(NO3)3·9H2O, citric acid, and ethylene glycol,
with a final temperature of 445 °C in a dry heating process.

Results
and Discussion
Figure 1a shows
photographs and color measurement results of our powder samples. The
samples heated below 80 and at 85 °C appeared dark and bright
brown, respectively. The samples heated above 90 °C appeared
red and became darker at higher heating temperatures. The reflectance
curves for the samples (Figure 1b) show the distinctive profile of hematite, and the reflectance
values above 580 nm increased in the order of 150 < 120 °C
= 90 °C < reference sample (PC) < 85 °C. The sample
heated at 85 °C exhibited a bright yellowish brown color because
of strong reflection of visible light in the range of 500–600
nm. Figure 1c shows
the plot of L*, a*, and b* values of the powder samples. For the sample heated at
85 °C, the value of L* was highest and the value
of b* was 10 higher than that of a*, giving rise to a color closer to a bright yellowish brown rather
than red. The samples that appeared red showed similar a* and b* values and relatively high L*, and these values decreased with increasing heat treatment temperature.
The values of the red samples were close to those of a conventional
hematite powder (PC) composed of particles of 40–120 nm in
diameter.

°C from left to right. (b) Reflectance curves and (c) plots of a*, b*, and L* values
of sample powders and the reference sample (PC). L* indicates lightness, and a* and b* indicate chromaticity, i.e., color directions. Positive and negative
values of a* indicate the reddish and greenish color,
respectively, whereas positive and negative values of b* indicate the yellowish and bluish color, respectively.

Figure 2 shows the
XRD pattern of the samples. Two broadened peaks centered on 2θ
values of 34 and 62° were observed in both the samples heated
at 70 and 80 °C, indicating the formation of nanocrystalline
iron oxyhydroxide, two-line ferrihydrite.33,34 A mixture of hematite and α-FeOOH (goethite) diffraction peaks
was observed in the sample heated at 85 °C. The diffraction peaks
of hematite dominated the pattern; however, low-intensity peaks attributed
to goethite appeared in the sample heated at 90 °C. Monophasic
hematite was found in the sample heated above 120 °C. Dissolution
and precipitation of iron oxides and oxyhydroxides occurred during
heat treatment under pressure. Thus, two-line ferrihydrite precipitation
proceeded below 80 °C, appearing as the two broad peaks in XRD
patterns. Above 80 °C, the transformation of two-line ferrihydrite
to goethite and goethite to hematite occurred simultaneously. Two-line
ferrihydrite, goethite, and hematite powders typically show dark brown,
yellow, and red colors, respectively.35 Thus, the sample powder colors reflected varying degrees of mixing
of these original colors (Figure 1). The crystallite sizes, estimated from the full width
half-maximum of the (104) hematite diffraction peak located at 2θ
= 33.15°, were 15, 15, 23, and 31 nm for the samples heated at
85, 90, 120, and 150 °C, respectively, and these values increased
with increasing heat treatment temperature. Hematite powder pigments
composed of small particles are known to have more desirable color
properties.21 The higher L*, a*, and b* values of powders
synthesized at lower heating temperatures may be related to the variation
in their crystallite sizes.

Figure 2 Powder XRD patterns of samples heated at various
temperatures.

Figure 3 shows SEM
images of the samples. The sample heated at 80 °C composed of
2-line ferrihydrite featured large needle-like particles of 1.3–6.0
μm in width and 4.9–30 μm in length (Figure 3a). Similar needle-like particles
of 0.4–2.6 μm in width and 2.7–11 μm in
length were observed in the sample heated at 85 °C (Figure 3b), which was composed
of a mixture of goethite and hematite phases. This sample also featured
small spherical particles of 60–180 nm in diameter (Figure 3c, arrow). Small
needle-like particles of 40 nm in width and 200 nm in length (Figure 3c, arrowhead) were
also observed on the surface of the large needle-like particles. The
spherical particles were composed of smaller primary particles of
10–13 nm in diameter. On the basis of the particle morphologies,
abundance ratio of each particle type, and the XRD results, the fine
needle-like and spherical particles likely arose from goethite and
hematite phases, respectively. The sample heated at 90 °C, which
appeared to be almost monophasic hematite by XRD, featured only spherical
secondary particles made up to primary particles of 9–19 nm
in diameter (Figure 3d). The primary and secondary particles of the sample heated to 120
°C grew to 13–21 and 40–160 nm (Figure 3e), respectively. The sample
heated at 150 °C featured only large primary particles of 30–85
nm in diameter (Figure 3f). The primary particle size dependence on temperature observed
by SEM agreed well with that determined from the XRD results.

Figure 3 SEM images
of samples heated at (a) 80, (b) 85, (c) 85, (d) 90,
(e) 120, and (f) 150 °C.

The primary particle size of the sample heated at 90 °C
was
smaller than that of the sample heated at 120 °C. Although the
secondary particle sizes of both samples were comparable, the L*, a*, and b* values
of the sample heated at 90 °C were higher than those of the sample
heated at 120 °C. The primary particle size of the sample heated
at 150 °C was larger than those of samples heated at 90 and 120
°C. The sample heated at 150 °C also showed the lowest L*, a*, and b* values
among the samples. These results indicate that the hematite powder
color depends on the primary particle size rather than the secondary
particle size. Hematite with smaller primary particle sizes showed
higher L*, a*, and b* values.

Next, samples prepared at 90, 120, and 150 °C
were applied
to the white porcelain test pieces to prepare akae overglaze enamels. The akae test pieces prepared
based on these samples were compared with an akae test piece prepared using a conventional hematite powder (PC) as
a reference. Figure 4 shows color measurements and photographs of the test pieces. The
reflectance values of the test pieces based on samples prepared at
different temperatures showed similar reflectance values, which were
consistently higher than those of the reference sample (Figure 4a). Although the reference
sample exhibited a dark dull red color, the test pieces based on the
sample heated at 90 °C showed a bright yellowish red color (photographs
in Figure 4b). This
bright red color resembled that of Kakiemon-style wares, a highly
ranked traditional Japanese akae porcelain. The test
piece based on the sample heated at 90 °C exhibited significantly
higher L*, a*, and b* values than those of the reference sample (Figure 4b). This suggests that the hematite powders
prepared in this study are suitable for use as red overglaze enamels.
The highest CIE parameter values were obtained from the sample heated
at 90 °C, which also featured the smallest primary particle size.

Figure 4 (a) Reflectance
curves and (b) plots of a*, b*,
and L* values of samples heated at
90, 120, and 150 °C and the reference sample (PC). The insets
in (b) show photographs of porcelain samples prepared using the sample
heated at 90 °C (upper) and the reference sample (lower).

We used microscopy to evaluate
the dispersion of hematite particles
within the glass layer in the test pieces prepared from the sample
heated at 90 °C and from the reference sample. Figure 5 shows gray-scale dark-field
light microscopy images, where white dots and areas of dark contrast
represent hematite particles and regions of the glass containing no
hematite, respectively. The test piece prepared with the reference
sample contained large hematite particle aggregates of ∼5 μm
and large regions of glass (∼10 μm) containing no hematite
(Figure 5a). However,
well-dispersed hematite particles were observed in the test piece
prepared with the sample heated at 90 °C (Figure 5b). These particles appeared to be of similar
sizes, and the regions of glass containing no particles were around
2–3 μm, which is close to the particle size of the frit
starting material. This indicates that our hematite powders have superior
dispersibility in molten lead-free glass frit. Thus, the good dispersion
of hematite particles in the glass layer allows us to realize the
bright red color of the akae test piece.

sample and (b) the sample heated at 90 °C. Raw color data were
converted to gray-scale images. Dark and light regions indicate hematite-free
glass regions and hematite particles, respectively.

Conclusions
To prepare hematite
powders suitable for use with lead-free frit,
we used a hydrothermal treatment to synthesize hematite powders that
showed good dispersion in molten glass. The precursor paste, prepared
by mixing iron nitrate and ammonium hydrogen carbonate, was sealed
in a container and heated at 70–150 °C. Dark brown powders
that formed below 80 °C showed two broad features in the XRD
pattern indicative of the formation of a two-line ferrihydrite phase.
A bright brown powder containing a mixture of goethite and hematite
phases formed at 85 °C. Red powders mainly composed of hematite
were obtained above 90 °C, and powders of monophasic hematite
formed above 120 °C. The red samples, heated at higher temperatures,
showed higher reflectance values of visible light. The highest CIE
parameter values were found in the sample heated at 90 °C. The
samples prepared at 90 and 120 °C featured secondary spherical
particles of ∼100 nm in diameter, which were composed of smaller
primary particles of ∼15 nm. The sample heated at 150 °C
was composed only of primary particles of ∼60 nm in diameter.
We prepared akae test pieces using these red powders
as a pigment and obtained bright red akae. The CIE
parameters of these test pieces were significantly higher than those
of an akae prepared using a conventional hematite
powder. Microscopic observations suggested that excellent dispersion
of the hematite particles in the glass layer led to the bright red
color of the resultant akae. We expect that the hematite
powder prepared in this study not only will be applied to the porcelain
industry but may also have wider applications in the field of nanotechnology
such as in energy conversion materials.
