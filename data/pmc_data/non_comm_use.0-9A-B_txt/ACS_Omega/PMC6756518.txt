The
functionalization of interfaces has become very important for
the protection or modification of metal (metal oxides) surfaces. The
functionalization of aluminum is particularly interesting because
of its relevance in fabricating components for electronic devices.
In this work, the utilization of squaramic acids for the functionalization
of aluminum substrates is reported for the first time. The physicochemical
properties of the interfaces rendered by n-alkyl
squaramic acids on aluminum metal substrates coated with pseudoboehmite
[Al(O)x(OH)y] layers are characterized
by contact angle, grazing-angle Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy,
atomic force microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy, and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight.
Moreover, we could confirm the squaramic functionalization of the
substrates by diffuse reflectance UV–vis spectroscopy, which
cannot be used for the characterization of UV–vis-inactive
substrates such as carboxylates and phosphonates, commonly used for
coating metallic surfaces. Remarkably, the results of sorption experiments
indicate that long-chain alkyl squaramic acid desorbs from activated-aluminum
substrates at a reduced rate compared to palmitic acid, a carboxylic
acid frequently used for the functionalization of metal oxide surfaces.
Theoretical calculations indicate that the improved anchoring properties
of squaramic acids over carboxylates are probably due to the formation
of additional hydrogen bonding interactions on the interface. Accordingly,
we propose N-alkyl squaramic acids as new moieties
for efficient functionalization of metal oxides.

Introduction
Squaramides, the 3,4-diaminoderivatives
of squaric acid,1,2 have received increasing attention
during recent years because of
their broad range of applications in many fields such as ion recognition
and transport,3−7 sensing,8−10 catalysis,11,12 biomedicine,5,13,14 and material science.15−17 Squaramides are planar and aromatic compounds with two carbonyl
and two amide-type NH groups which make these molecules suitable for
strong hydrogen bonding interactions (Figure 1a).1 Indeed, squaramides
exhibit unique association abilities via hydrogen bonding and stacking
interactions, which is the basis of their chemistry. Less known 3-hydroxy-4-amino
derivatives of squaric acid, referred to henceforth as squaramic acids
(Figure 1b), combine
in its molecular structure acidic OH and amide-type NH groups suitable
for providing ionic and hydrogen bonding interactions.17−19 Squaramic acids exhibit very high kinetic stabilities with pKa values at around 1–2, which ensure
that they are deprotonated in a wide range of pH.18,19 Considering their oxoanionic structure and acid–base properties,
we envisaged that squaramic acids could be used in applications that
require acidic moieties while additional hydrogen bonding interactions
could be beneficial to reinforce the binding of squaramic acids to
solid surfaces. In this regard, it is well known that alkyl carboxylates
and phosphonates, among others, can establish relatively strong interactions
with oxide-based surfaces and nanoparticles.20−22 For example,
treatment of metal oxide substrates with n-alkyl
carboxylic acids leads to the adsorption of the organic molecules
on the metal surface, which can also lead to the formation of self-assembled
monolayers when surfactants (with long hydrocarbon chains) are used.23−26 This process is utilized to protect metals and oxides from erosion
or decomposition and undesired chemical reactions and to provide additional
properties (i.e., hydrophobic behavior), and therefore it is highly
relevant for the material’s development.27−29 It is generally
accepted that these compounds are attached to the surface by the coordination
of the oxoanionic groups to the metal oxide but depending on the conditions
in the adjacent solution those bonds can be easily hydrolyzed.21,23,30−35 Thus, the reinforcement of those coordination bonds to avoid detachment
of the functional groups is of high interest. In this direction, squaramic
acids are highly acidic oxoanionic compounds with enhanced kinetic
stability of the amide-type group toward hydrolytic degradation18 ideally suited to be used as anchoring moieties
for the functionalization of metal oxide surfaces. Remarkably, they
may be suitable to interact by a primary interaction between the oxoanionic
groups of metal oxide surfaces, as per example aluminum oxide-hydroxide
surface, and establish additional hydrogen bonding interactions (with
the surface and with other squaramic moieties) utilizing the amide-type
NH or the non-coordinated carbonyl groups. Accordingly, squaramic
acids would be advantageous over carboxylic and phosphonic acids because
they may be capable to establish multiple interactions at the interface
of hydrophilic surfaces which may result in a strengthened linkage.

squaramic acids 1–4. Putative hydrogen bonding
interactions are indicated with green arrows.

Herein, we report on the utilization of N-alkyl
substituted squaramic acids 1–4 (Figure 1b) for the functionalization
of metal aluminum substrates. Aluminum is a relevant material because
of its extensive use in microelectronics,36−38 and therefore
its functionalization is important for many applications. In the present
work, the functionalization of the aluminum substrates was achieved
after a previous thermal treatment with water, which produced an activated
layer of aluminum oxyhydroxide, suitable for anchoring oxoanionic
groups.31,34,39 The activated
substrates treated with compounds 1–2 (bearing
longer hydrocarbon chains) exhibit hydrophobic characteristics as
it is deduced from water droplet–surface contact angles around
120° (Figure 2). The attachment of squaramic acid groups on the surface is demonstrated
and characterized by atomic force microscopy (AFM), scanning electron
microscopy (SEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), matrix-assisted
laser desorption ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF), grazing-angle
Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (GA-FTIR), and diffuse reflectance
UV measurements. Remarkably, desorption experiments and theoretical
calculations reveal that squaramic acid 1 binds more
strongly on the activated aluminum surfaces than palmitic acid (PA), a compound commonly used for surface modification. Accordingly,
squaramic acid motifs are candidates to be used for the functionalization
of metal oxide surfaces with reinforced interactions.

acids are indicated with the corresponding code number of the squaramic
acid (Figure 1b).

Results and Discussion
Compounds 1–4 were prepared via a straightforward
synthetic procedure from the corresponding alkylamine and diethyl
squarate (see Experimental Section and Supporting Information). In the first step, diethyl
squarate was allowed to react in acetonitrile with one equivalent
of the selected alkyl amine to produce the mixed squaramide ester.
After solvent evaporation, the residue was treated with boiling water
to produce the corresponding squaramic acid with moderate-to-good
yields. Accordingly, the final squaramic acids were obtained via an
easy synthetic method, easy work-up and from commercially available
compounds.

For the functionalization of aluminum plates with
squaramic acids,
the plates were first polished and then activated by treatment with
boiling water, according to a previously described procedure (see Experimental Section).32 This process produces an aluminum oxyhydroxide (with a pseudoboehmite
structure)36,37 thin film on the surface, enabling
the substrate to be used in adsorption experiments.32 The coordination of carboxylic acids to alumina derivatives
is well-known,42−46 and we expected that squaramic derivatives could coordinate pseudo-boehmite
interfaces in a similar mode. The activated substrates were subsequently
treated with the selected squaramic acid 1–4 suspended
in heptane (see Experimental Section). The
hydrophobicity of the already deposited material, indicative of the
attachment of the organic compounds, was tested by contact angle measurements
(Figure 2 inset and Experimental Section). Figure 2 indicates the contact angles of different
aluminum substrates before and after the treatment with PA and the squaramic acids 1–4 compared to that
for PA taken as reference.

The commercial aluminum
plates show contact angles of around 53°
but decrease to 31° after the polishing process. The subsequent
hydrothermal activation gives rise to contact angles below 10°.32 These results indicate the high hydrophilicity
of the surface after the activation process, which is consistent with
the formation of an aluminum oxy-hydroxide layer.40,41 As expected, the contact angles drastically increase after the treatment
of the activated plates with squaric acids 1–3, while remains below 10° for the plates soaked with 4. The larger contact angles were observed for the substrates treated
with squaramic acids 1 (121°) and 2 (118°) with longer alkyl chains. These results are consistent
with the successful adsorption of the squaramic acids on the surface,
where the polar parts interact with the aluminum oxy-hydroxide interface
and the alkyl chains are perpendicular to the surface in contact to
air. Accordingly, the derivatives with longer alkyl groups namely,
hexadecyl and dodecyl, provide higher hydrophobic character of the
substrates.21 The higher ability of long
hydrocarbon chains to form self-assembled monolayers could also play
a role in the increased hydrophobicity.23−26 As control experiments, activated
aluminum plates were treated with PA, following the analogous
procedure utilized for 1–4 (see Experimental Section). The substrate treated with PA showed contact angles (120°) similar to the plates treated
with squaramic acid 1 (121°) with analogous hydrocarbon
chain. Those contact angles are lower than that measured in superhydrophobic
surfaces prepared by coating-functionalized alumina nanoparticles
(155°),47 but they are consistent
with a regular functionalization of the surfaces by SAMs.23,26

To get insight into the characteristics of the functionalized
aluminum
plates, we analyzed the changes experienced by the aluminum plates
after the treatment with squaramic acid 1 by AFM and
SEM (Figure 3 and Figures
S1 and S2). Both microscopic techniques provided similar results.
After polishing, AFM images show a smooth surface of the metallic
plates (Figure 3a).
However, after the activation with boiling water, the aluminum surface
becomes altered due to the formation of a pseudoboehmite oxide hydroxide
layer.31,48Figure 3b shows the AFM image of the activated aluminum surface
where randomly distributed wormlike nanostructures can be appreciated.
This uniform pattern, as well as the corresponding cross-section profiles,
appears unaltered after the treatment with 1 or PA (Figures 3c,d). Accordingly, both contact angle and AFM experiments indicate
that the squaramic acid 1 or PA attaches
to the aluminum surface without extensive multilayer deposition, which
would lead to an increase of the thickness of the cross-section and
a decrease of the surface roughness.

Figure 3 Surface topographic AFM images (2 ×
2 μm): (a) Polished
aluminum surface. (b) Neat activated aluminum surface before (b) and
after deposition of 1 (c) or PA (d) on the
activated aluminum surface.

Mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF), XPS, UV–vis reflectance
spectroscopy,
and GA-FTIR experiments (see Experimental Section and Supporting Information) support the
attachment of squaramic acid 1 on the activated aluminum
surfaces. MALDI-TOF experiments performed by directly shooting on
the aluminum substrates treated with compound 1 showed
two peaks at 338.477 and 360.462 m/z assigned to (M + H)+ and (M + Na)+, respectively
(Figure S3). In the same vein, XPS shows a chemical composition on
the surface of 0.9% of N, 22.8% of C, 53.7% of oxygen, and 22.6% of
Al. This composition is consistent with the presence of squaramic
acid 1 on the substrate (Figures S4 and S5). Furthermore,
the attachment of 1 on the substrates was monitored by
total reflectance UV experiments because squaramic acids, unlike other
common chemical groups used for these purposes such as n-alkyl carboxylic acids or phosphonic acids, are UV-active compounds.
The UV–vis reflectance spectrum of an aluminum substrate functionalized
with 1 shows an intense and broad peak with a maximum
located at around 268 nm (Figure 4) assigned to “HOMO–LUMO” transition
of the squaryl group. This band compares with the absorption profile
of squaramic acid 4, the only water-soluble squaramic
acid presented in this work19 (Figure 4 inset). Remarkably,
the use of reflectance UV–vis experiments has never been applied
for this purpose because n-alkyl carboxylic acids
or phosphonic acids typically used for these purposes do not exhibit
suitable absorption features.

region of an aluminum
plate functionalized with 1. Inset: Absorbance spectrum
of 4 (2.0 × 10–5 M) in water.

GA-FTIR experiments were also
carried out to get insight into the
strength of the attachment of the squaramic acid 1 with
the activated aluminum plates. Figure 5 shows the relevant areas of the IR spectra of 1 in KBr and the activated aluminum plates before and after
the treatment with 1. Aluminum plates treated with 1 show absorption bands associated with C–H stretching
vibrations of the n-alkyl chain at 2800–3000
and the diagnostic breathing band of the squaryl moiety at around
1800 cm–1 (Figure 5). Specifically, the C–H stretching vibrations
of 1 appear at 2951, 2915, and 2850 cm–1 and the characteristic breathing band of the cyclobutenedione moiety
at 1817 cm–1 when measured as unionized squaramic
acid in KBr. These frequencies change to 2960, 2926, 2856, and 1792
cm–1, respectively, when 1 is adsorbed
on the aluminum plates (Figure 5 and Table S1). The shift of the breathing band from 1817
to 1792 cm–1 suggests the presence of squaramate
anions interacting with the aluminum surface49 and is in accordance with coordination models previously proposed
for carboxylates and phosphonates.21 Unfortunately,
not much information of other vibrations (i.e. NH) can be traced from
these experiments because of the low resolution of the technique.
The attachment of PA on the substrates was also monitored
by GA-FTIR, but in this case only the signals corresponding to the
stretching of the hydrocarbon chains were observed (Figure S6 and
Table S1).

plates before (black) and after (red) functionalization with squaramic
acid 1. Relevant parts of the FTIR spectrum of compound 1 in KBr (blue).

To evaluate the strength of the attachment of the squaramic
acids
on the activated alumina surfaces, we performed adsorption/desorption
experiments of 1 and PA. The adsorption
experiments were carried out on activated aluminum plates immersed
in a solution of 1 or PA in heptane for
increasing periods. Then, the plates were analyzed by GA-FTIR and
contact angle measurements. Figure 6a shows a representation of the contact angles of aluminum
plates treated with PA and 1 for different
immersion periods. In both cases, longer immersion leads to an increase
of the water–substrates contact angles. These results, which
are according to GA-FTIR experiments (Figure S6), are attributed to
an increase of the adsorbed organic compound. Under these experimental
conditions, it is apparent that the adsorption of PA is
faster than with 1, which is probably related to the
better solubility of PA in the heptane media. While the
adsorption of PA reaches 80% of the maximum contact angle
in 5 min, compound 1 requires 8–9 h to reach similar
values (Figure 6a).
In both cases, no changes on the contact angles were observed for
films immersed more than 24 h, which indicates that after this time
the aluminum surface becomes saturated with the adsorbate.

the contact angles measured by treating activated aluminum
plates with solutions of PA (black circles) and 1 (red circles) in heptane as a function of the immersion
period. (b) Contact angles of the fully functionalized plates with PA (black) and 1 (red) immersed in water (squares)
or iPrOH (circles) for increasing periods. (c) Side views of a sessile
drop on the aluminum substrates fully functionalized with 1 and immersed in isopropanol for different periods. The corresponding
contact angle values and the immersion times are indicated above and
below each image, respectively.

Desorption of PA and 1 from the
substrates
was also evaluated by immersing the already functionalized aluminum
plates (prepared by 24 h immersion in solutions of PA or 1) into isopropanol (iPrOH) or water. Isopropanol
was chosen for the experiments because both acids are soluble in this
solvent, while the experiments in water give us information about
the robustness of the attachments of the molecules to the surfaces,
which is useful to analyze their further application as coatings.
It can be seen that, when the plates were immersed in iPrOH, the contact
angles of the coated samples decrease by increasing the time of immersion
(Figure 6b). It is
noteworthy that the plates treated with PA requires 8
h of immersion to reach angles below 10°, while the plates treated
with squaramic acid 1 requires 19 h. The decrease of
the contact angles is associated with desorption of the organic compounds
from the surface, which is also confirmed by total reflectance UV
experiments for plates treated with 1 (Figure S7). Thus,
the desorption rate in iPrOH is slower with 1 than with PA-functionalized plates. Immersion in water led to a similar
conclusion. Figure 6b shows a plot of the contact angles of the substrates coated with PA and 1 after different immersion periods in
water. It is apparent that the desorption of plates coated with 1 is slower than with those treated with PA.
The plates functionalized with PA decrease the contact
angle below 50° after 24 h of immersion, while the plates treated
with squaramic acid 1 decrease the contact angle only
up to 80° with the same immersion times. Similar values were
recorded after 48 h of immersion. From these experiments, it can be
concluded that, as expected, adsorption of these compounds on activated
aluminum is reversible due to the establishment of relatively weak
interactions between the coating molecules and the aluminum substrates.
However, it is clear that the kinetics of desorption of compound 1 from the aluminum plates is slower than for PA, which is an advantage to create more robust functionalization of
surfaces.

We have carried out theoretical calculations (density
functional
theory) to investigate the mechanism of insertion of squaramate into
the activated aluminum. For this purpose, a boehmite (γ-AlOOH)
surface (100-atoms supercell) was generated and optimized (see Supporting Information for computational details).
The resulting supercell displays OH groups on the surface, which are
directly attached to the Al (octahedral geometry) atoms. The (010)
surface was selected because previous studies have already shown that
it is the most stable,50 and, moreover,
it has been successfully used to analyze the insertion of phosphonic
acids.51 The proposed mechanism involves
the protonation of one of the OH groups of the supercell by the squaramic
acid (or carboxylic acid) and a subsequent replacement of water by
the squaramate (or a carboxylate) anion though a coordination bond
to two Al-atoms. For the theoretical studies, we have used squaramic
acid 4 and butyric acid as models. The inserted complexes
were optimized at the B3LYP/6-31G* level of theory, and it was found
that the most stable coordination mode for squaramate is though the
central carbonyl group as it is shown in Figure 7a. Remarkably, this coordination mode provides
two hydrogen bonding interactions between the two carbonyls of the
squaramate and two vicinal OH groups of the boehmite surface (OH···OC
distance of 1.70 Å and O–H···O angle 153°).
This coordination mode presents a binding energy of −19.5 kcal/mol,
which corresponds to the replacement of an OH– by
the squaramate with the concomitant release of a water molecule. In
contrast, the boehmite–carboxylate system presents significantly
reduced binding energy (−2.6 kcal/mol, see Figure 7b), where only one hydrogen
bond is formed, which exhibits longer OH···OC distance
(2.13 Å) compared to the squaramate and a very poor directionality
(O–H···O angle is 119°). We have further
analyzed and described in the Supporting Information the effect of the insertion of a second squaramate or carboxylate
moiety (see Figure S8). In short, the insertion of the second squarate
provides an extra stabilization energy of 3.4 kcal/mol due to an antiparallel
CO···CO interaction (Figure S9), while the insertion
of a second carboxylate does not. These results agree with the desorption
experiments.

Conclusions
In summary, we have
shown that squaramic acid is a suitable moiety
for the functionalization of activated aluminum surfaces. The synthesis
of these compounds is easy and can be prepared in a large scale in
only one-step synthesis from commercially available compounds, which
make these compounds suitable for industrial applications. It was
demonstrated that squaramic acid 1 physically adsorbs
on aluminum oxy-hydroxide layer forming a hydrophobic monolayer on
the surface. Remarkably, desorption of 1 from the aluminum
surface in isopropanol is slower than for PA, suggesting
the formation of a stronger attachment by using squaramic acid. Theoretical
calculations indicate that the reinforced squaramic–substrate
interactions are due to the formation of hydrogen bonding interactions,
enabled due to the unique molecular structure of squaramate anions
with three accepting C–O groups. Accordingly, squaramic acids
are serious candidates to be applied in the functionalization of metal
oxides offering improved attachment properties compared to carboxylic
acids.

Experimental Section
Materials and Solutions
All the
chemicals and reagents
were of commercial origin (Aldrich or Scharlau) and were used as received.
All the solvents were purchased from Scharlau. The deuterated solvents
for the NMR studies were purchased from Euriso-top. The aluminum plates
used for the experiments are based on polycrystalline aluminum (Al
99.99%, Si 0.01%) of 1 mm thickness and were purchased from ABCR (Germany).
Two types of plates were used, squares of 1 × 1 cm for the AFM
experiments and disks of 2.5 cm2 for the rest of the experiments.

General Synthesis of Squaramic Acids 1–4
Diethyl squarate (340 mg, 2 mmol) in 10 mL of MeCN was
added dropwise to a 2.2 mmol solution of the corresponding amine in
10 mL of MeCN under stirring. The mixture was left for 12 h under
stirring at room temperature. Then, the solution was concentrated
and the resulting solid was refluxed for 12 h in 20 mL of water. The
suspension was filtered, and the solid was subsequently washed with
1 M NaOH (2 × 20 mL), MeCN (2 × 20 mL), CH2Cl2 (2 × 20 mL), MeCN (2 × 20 mL), 1 M HCl (2 ×
20 mL), and MeCN (2 × 20 mL). The remaining solid was dried under
vacuum to yield the corresponding squaramic acid as a white amorphous
solid. A detailed characterization of compounds 1–4 is described in the Supporting Information.

Activation of the Aluminum Substrates (Formation of Aluminum
Oxyhydroxide Layer)
The aluminum substrates were activated
following a previously described methodology.32 The square (1 × 1 cm) plates were polished via an electrolytic
process by using a TenuPol-5 (Struers) apparatus [5 °C, 40 V,
HClO4 (60%)]. The disklike (2.5 cm2) plates
were mechanically polished by using successively SiC paper (#600 and
#1200 grain size) and diamond particle suspensions (3 and 1 μm,
Buehler). After the polishing process, the plates were ultrasonicated
for 2 min in an ethanol/water (1:1) mixture and then dried in an argon
stream. The plates were then immersed in boiling water for 10 min
and dried again in an argon stream.

Adsorption of Compounds 1–4 and PA
The adsorption of
compounds 1–4 and PA on the aluminum
plates was carried out immediately after
the activation of the plates. The adsorption of PA was
carried out by immersing the activated plates into a 0.05 mM solution
in heptane for 24 h under orbital stirring. For the functionalization
with compounds 1–4, the activated aluminum plates
were immersed in a saturated solution of the corresponding acid, containing
part as undissolved solid, (0.017 g/L) in heptane for 24 h under orbital
stirring. Before the immersion of the plates, the initial milky suspension
of the squaramic acid was ultrasonicated with a GEX 130 apparatus
(Sonics) in the corresponding volume of heptane at 130 W for 10 min
and filtered to remove insolubles. After the treatment with the acids,
all the plates were immersed in a heptane solution and stirred (orbital)
for 10 min and then dried in an argon stream. The plates treated with
compounds 1–4 were additionally immersed into
isopropanol and sonicated for 10 s to remove loosely adsorbed material
and then dried under argon.

Adsorption and Desorption Experiments
For adsorption
experiments, the plates were activated and immersed for different
periods into the acid solution (PA) or (1) in heptane under orbital stirring. Then, the plates were washed
and dried according to the previously described methodologies and
used for the measurements. For desorption experiments, various plates
were functionalized with PA or 1 following
the general methodology. The resulting plates were immersed for variable
periods ranging from 1 min to 24 h into isopropanol or water (20 mL)
under orbital stirring. The plates were then dried in an argon stream
and then used for the measurements.

Contact Angle Measurements
Static water contact angles
were measured at room temperature using a home-made device equipped
with a DinoXcope camera and using the sessile drop method and image
analysis of a drop profile with the software ImageJ. The volume of
the water (Milli-Q) droplet was 5 μL. The contact angle values
given here correspond to the average of three droplets.
