Owing to their fundamental
importance and practical applications,
anatase TiO2 crystals with well-defined {001} and {101}
facets attracted intensive research interests. In this study, we systematically
investigated solvent dependence of the photoreaction of the different
coexposed crystal facets during noble metal photodeposition. By examining
the deposition position in each solvent, we revealed that solvents
play a pivotal role on the facet selectivity. On the basis of density
functional theory calculations, the solvent molecules were found to
modify both the crystal facet electronic structure and the {001}–{001}
heterojunction. These modifications are not only the origin of diverse
charge-carrier pathways but are also responsible for carrier accumulation
at specific facets that increase their reductive power. These findings
are vital for a better understanding of photocatalytic materials and
an improved design for the next-generation materials.

Introduction
Photocatalytic processes
occurring at a semiconductor surface,
such as TiO2, are key factors for the development of renewable
energy and green chemistry. Recently, anatase TiO2 crystals
with well-defined {001} and {101} facets have attracted tremendous
attention. Their special shape-dependent physicochemical properties1 and lower electron/hole (e–/h+) recombination rate compared to conventional TiO2 particles pave the way to overcome efficiency limitations
of TiO2 particles.2 Therefore,
they have great potential for a broad range of environmentally friendly
applications such as hydrogen production,3 pollutant degradation,4 photovoltaic
cells, and so on.5

Since the pioneering
work of Yang,6 reporting
the synthesis of a high-quality anatase TiO2 single crystal
with 47% exposed {001} facets, many scientist tried to improve catalytic
efficiency by playing with the {001}–{101} ratio.7 Majority of the studies gave an insight on the
higher photoactivity of predominant {001} facets for the degradation
of organic pollutants4a,7b and H2 production.7a,8 Contradictory results, however, revealed that the low-energy facets
{101} exhibit higher photocatalytic activities.9 This indicates that a comprehensive understanding of the
reactivity of the crystal facets still remains urgent. Despite the
efforts focusing on the structural properties, less attention has
been paid to the molecular adsorption of crystals on each facet with
the solvents used and their resulting photochemical behavior. For
this purpose, photocatalytic reactions, such as metal photodeposition,
can be used to explore both reduction and oxidation sites of the photocatalyst
including BiVO4,10 Cu2O,11 and BiOCL.12 However, the solvent effect on this facet dependency still remains
unclear, although it plays a substantial role during the metal photodeposition.

In this study, the role of solvent adsorption on coexposed anatase
crystal facets {001} and {101} is systematically investigated through
noble metal photodeposition. Particularly, comparing methanol, water,
and ethylene glycol (EG), we found that metal nanoparticles (NPs)
can be photodeposited selectively on different facets of the TiO2 single crystal. Complementary first-principles density functional
theory (DFT) calculations were performed to assess the impact of different
solvent adsorptions on the crystal facet electronic structures and
to suggest a change in photogenerated charge (e–/h+) pathways upon solvent adsorption. The theoretical
study implies that these pathways induce the different location/sizes
of the deposited metal NPs. The combined experimental and theoretical
results not only offer a deep insight on the tunable selective photodeposition
on the modified facets of the anatase TiO2 crystal but
also contribute to the knowledge about the mechanisms governing the
reactivity and selectivity of the well-defined anatase TiO2 crystals, which could be useful for a better engineering of advanced
titanium-based photocatalysts.

Results and Discussion
Synthesis
of a well-defined anatase TiO2 single crystal
was carried out under hydrothermal condition according to the previous
report.6 Briefly, an aqueous titanium tetrafluoride
(TiF4) precursor containing hydrofluoric acid (HF) and
2-propanol was used to prepare TiO2 crystal. HF was added
to control the morphology of the crystals.6 More specifically, HF reduces the surface energy and retards the
growth of the {101} facets to facilitate the growth of the thermodynamically
less stable {001} surfaces. Furthermore, 2-propanol was also added
as a protecting agent to enhance the stabilization effect associated
with fluorine adsorption over the {001} surface, thus promoting the
growth of {001}.13 The crystals washed
three times with ethanol were drop-casted on a cover glass and annealed
at 475 °C for 2 h before the photodeposition experiment in order
to remove excess F ions that could inhibit metal photodeposition and
ensure to obtain clean facet surfaces.

Figure 1 shows SEM
images of the synthesized anatase TiO2 single crystals.
Both top- and side-view images of the crystal display the truncated
tetragonal bipyramidal structure in which two square surfaces and
eight isosceles trapezoidal surfaces were identified as {001} and
{101} facets, respectively, as confirmed by the interfacial angle
(68.3°) corresponding to the theoretical value between the two
facet planes (Figure 1a,b). The average length of the long side of the crystal marked with
“A” is ∼3.5 μm and that
of the short side (B) is ∼3.1 μm (Figure 1b). Although some
agglomerated particles were occasionally seen, most of them are well-defined
crystals. Darker spots on the {001} facets are most likely due to
surface defects. The uniformity of the anatase crystals was estimated
by statistically analyzing 20 crystals; the length A is 3.5 ± 0.5 μm (Figure 1c) and the degree of truncation (B/A) is 0.87 for over 40% crystals (Figure 1d), corresponding to 53% of
{001} facets from the total exposed facet surface. As a result, our
crystals exhibit almost equally coexposed facets, which allow us for
the fair assessment of the role of different facets because they would
contribute equally to the metal particle photodeposition.

During the photodeposition of noble metal NPs under UV light
irradiation,
photogenerated electrons from the TiO2 valence band (VB)
are excited into conduction band (CB) while leaving holes (h+) in the VB.14 The photogenerated electrons
are transferred to the facet surface and will react with the used
metal precursor (either H2PtCl6 or HAuCl4), promoting the photoreduction of metal ion Au3+ or Pt4+ on the TiO2 surface.15 This is generally accompanied by the elimination of photogenerated
holes by water oxidation.

The photodeposition of Pt or Au NPs
on TiO2 crystals
is rarely possible to be realized using pure water as a solvent owing
to the difficulty of photoreduction of the metal ions.16 In particular, for Pt, almost no metal deposition
was observed even after 5 min of UV radiation (Figure S1). To increase the photodeposition efficiency, organic
solvents, such as methanol or EG, are often added as a sacrificial
hole scavenger.17,18 These alcohol molecules have
a lower oxidation potential than water, leading to a faster oxidation.
Furthermore, alcohols are better hole scavengers because the oxidation
of alcohols is more efficient per molecule:19 three h+ are consumed for the full oxidation of a monoalcohol
(methanol), whereas five are needed for a diol, such as EG. Indeed,
by adding 20 vol % of methanol or EG to the aqueous solvent, the NP
photodeposition efficiency was enhanced (Figure 2a,b).

(e–h) Histograms of the size distribution of the respective
photodeposited metal NPs based on the SEM images of 10 crystals.

A striking feature, clearly seen
in the SEM images (Figures 2a–d and S2), is the position
of photodeposited metal
NPs depending on solvents used for the reaction. When Pt photodeposition
is conducted in a methanol/H2O mixture, 96% of the grafted
Pt NPs were selectively deposited on the {101} facets rather than
on the {001} facets (Figure 2a). The Pt NPs are relatively polydispersed with an average
size of around 350 nm (Figure 2e). By contrast, when photodeposition is performed using an
EG/H2O mixture, around 93% of the NPs are found on the
{001} facet (Figure 2b). In this case, the NPs are relatively monodispersed with the size
of less than 100 nm (Figure 2f). Therefore, higher yield and better quality of photodeposition
are possible in the presence of EG in terms of uniformity and reproducibility.

Similar results were found for the photodeposition of Au NPs. The
Au photodeposition tends to be more efficient than the Pt photodeposition
because while four electrons are necessary to reduce one Pt4+-ion atom, Au3+ only needs three electrons, leading to
faster deposition. Au NPs are deposited mostly on the {101} facet
(78%) in water with an average size over all facets of 110 nm (Figure 2c,g). Adding monoalcohols
does not significantly induce facet preferences of Au photodeposition:
particles are deposited on both facets, but still a strong preference
of deposition on or close to the {101} facet remains. The particle
size is relatively large, and their size and shape are highly polydispersed
under this condition (Figure S4b,c). Remarkably,
adding a low amount of EG into water altered the facet preference.
Most particles are now found on the {001} facet (98%) with a size
less than 200 nm (Figure 2d,h). Interestingly, using pure anhydrous EG as a solvent,
the facet preference completely disappears. Instead, the particles
were well-spread over the crystal with more uniform size (∼50
nm) (Figures S4d and S5).

Facet dependence
of the metal photodeposition is obviously affected
by the organic solvent added to the aqueous solution. When water or
monoalcohols are adsorbed onto the anatase crystals, the {101} facets
provide more reduction sites, resulting in the selective reduction
of the metal. The complementary water/methanol oxidation will occur
more at the {001} facet.16 The same tendency
of selective Pt loading on the {101} facet has previously been observed
by adding small amounts of 2-propanol to the water.16 In contrast to this conventional behavior, when diol solvents,
such as EG, are adsorbed onto the TiO2 crystal surface,
the reduction sites are mainly located on the {001} facet.

Because
monoalcohols are good hole scavengers, they reduce the
e–/h+ recombination. Therefore, once
a metal NP is created, it acts as an electron trap, through Schottky
barrier formation, prohibiting other electrons from reducing Pt or
Au at other positions. This may explain the larger Pt or Au NPs photodeposited
on the anatase TiO2 crystal in the presence of monoalcohol.
According to our previous research, the EG molecules, by contrast,
block the TiO2 surface with both hydroxyl groups.18 Therefore, EG controls the positions where the
electrons and holes reach the surface, explaining the creation of
monodispersed small NPs.

Recent theoretical studies pointed
out that different anatase crystal
facets possess different surface energy levels of the CB and VB owing
to the difference in their atomic arrangements.20 Because of this energy difference between {001} and {101}
facets and the fact that they are in contact, a new concept has been
studied,21 and it suggested that {001}
and {101} facets can form a surface heterojunction,21 that is, realignment of the energy bands at the {001}–{101}
interface, which promote the transfer of photogenerated electrons
and holes between the crystal facets.22 However, these previous calculations were performed on clean crystal
facets, that is, without any consideration of the adsorbed molecules
including solvents. In order to unravel the mechanism governing the
facet dependence observed in this study, we theoretically evaluated
the effect of solvent adsorption on the electronic structures of both
anatase crystal facets ({001} and {101}) by performing DFT calculations.

DFT calculations were performed within the generalized gradient
approximation as implemented in the SIESTA computational code23 within the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof
form.24 A double-ζ basis set of localized
atomic orbitals was used for the valence electrons, and the core electrons
were replaced by Troullier–Martins pseudopotentials.25 Sampling of the Brillouin zone was restricted
to the Γ point during geometric relaxation, and a (10 ×
10 × 1) Monkhorst–Pack grid was used for the density of
state (DOS) calculations,26 while a mesh
cutoff energy of 300 Ry has been imposed for real-space integration.
All structures were relaxed until forces were less than 0.05 eV/Å.
In the calculations, a vacuum interval of more than 10 Å was
used to avoid the interaction between the periodic slabs. A two-layer
TiO2 slab is used to model the adsorption of methanol and
EG on the {001} and {101} facets.18 The
advantage of this simple model is that it is not time-consuming, and
Martsinovich et al.27 have shown that a
two-layer slab is sufficient to describe the adsorption of molecules
on anatase TiO2. The surface areas are 7.57 Å ×
7.57 Å and 10.24 Å × 11.35 Å for anatase TiO2 {001} and {101} facets, respectively.

After geometric
relaxation, both methanol and EG dissociate upon
adsorption on the {001} facet (Figure S6). An O–Ti bond is broken in both cases; methanol forms a
methoxy group (CH3O–Ti) on the TiO2 surface,
whereas EG forms a hydroxyl–ethanolate group (HO–CH2–CH2–O–Ti). On the {101} facets,
molecular adsorption through hydrogen bonding between the OH groups
of the solvent molecules and oxygen atoms of TiO2 was found
in our calculation. These simulations are consistent with the previous
reports.27 The calculation in this study
has been limited on the first molecular layer because it has been
already shown that the first layers give the highest impact on the
electronic properties of TiO2 and that the results with
single layer28 and multilayers29 are qualitatively similar.

The DOS of
both facets clearly shows a typical electronic band
gap of about 3 eV.30 It is noteworthy that
the DOS of the two facets was aligned by the position of the O 2s
core levels and to avoid confusion in the energy scale, the highest
occupied state of the {001} facet is chosen as the Fermi level and
is set to zero. In the presence of a methanol molecule, the band gap
position on the {101} facet shifts toward lower energies with respect
to that of the {001} facets without changing the band gap width (Figure 3a). Similar behavior
has been found for clean {001} and {101} facets and upon adsorption
of water molecules on both TiO2 facets (Figure S7).17c,20 A striking difference was found
in the presence of EG molecules: the dissociative adsorption of EG
on the {001} facet induces the formation of an extralocalized electron
state within the TiO2 band gap at ∼2 eV below the
CB minimum, whereas the band gaps of both facets are relocated within
the same energy range (Figure 3b). This localized state may facilitate the electron excitation
formation by acting as a stepping stone between the VB and CB. Thus,
less energy is required for the electron excitation from the extra
DOS to the CB, which could result in enhancement of the electron transfer
between TiO2 and the acceptor species.

Figure 3 (Top) DOS plots of {001}
and {101} facets upon adsorption of (a)
methanol and (b) EG. Extralocalized state is induced by the adsorption
of EG within the band gap of TiO2. (Bottom) Energy band
diagrams illustrating the {001} and {101} surface heterojunction affected
by the adsorption of (c) methanol and (d) EG and their different photogenerated
e–/h+ trajectories over the anatase TiO2 crystal.

When the {001} and {101}
facets are in contact, their Fermi level
should be located at the same energy level.21 Therefore, the energy difference between the facets adsorbed with
methanol inevitably drives a migration of photogenerated electrons
from the higher surface energy facet {001} to the lower surface energy
facet {101} (Figure 3c). Subsequently, the holes tend to accumulate on the {001} facet
to reach the most stable energy configuration. This is the origin
of the selective metal reduction on the {101} facets in the presence
of water or methanol. This charge-carrier-transfer scenario changes
upon adsorption of EG molecules on the surface (Figure 3d).

When EG molecules are adsorbed,
a lower energy difference between
the crystal facets is found, suggesting that electron migration between
{001} and {101} is mostly suppressed. In this case, photogenerated
e–/h+ could be found simultaneously on
both crystal surfaces. The photocatalytic oxidation and reduction
can take place synchronously on both {001} and {101} facets. However,
owing to the extralocalized state inducing more electrons, the lack
of electron transfer to the {101} facet, and the larger facet surface,
the excited electrons are located more at the {001} facet. Hence,
metal ions will be reduced more efficiently at this facet (Figure 3d). EG adsorption
leads not only to a favorable selectivity of the {001} facet but also
to a more controlled photodeposition of noble metal NPs on both facet
surfaces. Because more electrons are produced on the {001} facet owing
to the extralocalized state, holes are also produced in the same facet,
which are localized at the {001} facet. The generated holes on the
{001} facet could induce a slightly higher oxidation power of the
{001} facet. In our experiments, EG molecules were likely oxidized
as they are very efficient hole scavengers. Although the enhanced
oxidation power could be used for selective photodeposition of a metal
oxide as performed in ref (29), it is out of scope in this study.

Conclusions
In
summary, the pivotal role of solvents on the facet-dependent
photocatalytic property on highly uniform anatase TiO2 crystals
with equally coexposed {001} and {101} facets was revealed. On the
basis of the agreement between the experimental and DFT results, the
selectivity and reactivity of different facets are found to be highly
affected by the adsorption of reactant molecules. This behavior is
confirmed to be related to the different electron pathways over TiO2 crystals. Interestingly, we found that EG adsorption not
only lowers the energy difference between the anatase crystal facets
but also induces a new localized state, resulting in a more efficient
NP photodeposition on the {001} facet and a higher quality and uniformity
of metal NPs. Thus, using the appropriate solvent is a key factor
to tune the selectivity of facets and to control the quality of metal
NP photodeposition (size and position) on the anatase TiO2 crystals. These findings provide new insights for a more effective
and comprehensive assessment on the role of TiO2 crystal
facets in photocatalytic processes. The latter is a necessity to design
advanced photocatalytic materials for large-scale applications.

Experimental
Section
Materials
TiF4, HCl (10 M), iso-propylalcohol,
HF (48%), and EG (99%, spectrograde) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich
and used without further purification. H2PtCl6 (99.999% trace metal basis) was purchased from Acros Chemicals and
used without further purification. Methanol was purchased from Merck
and used without further purification. All solutions were prepared
in Milli-Q water (18 MΩ, Millipore).

Synthesis of Anatase TiO2 Single Crystals
TiO2 crystals with controlled
{101} and {001} facets were
synthesized under hydrothermal conditions, following literature procedures.13 In detail, 49.5 mg of TiF4 was dissolved
in 10 mL of a 0.01 M HCL solution. This solution (1 mL) was mixed
with 13.5 mL of iso-propylalcohol, 13.9 mL of H2O, and
0.104 mL of 48% HF.6Caution: Hydrofluoric acid is extremely corrosive and a contact poison.
Addition of HF was carried out in a specially assigned room wearing
protective clothes, with calcium gluconate in close vicinity. An autoclave
with total volume of 12 mL was filled with 9 mL of the latter solution
and heated in an oven at 180 °C for 24 h. The crystals were centrifuged
and washed three times with ethanol. The cleaned crystal solution
(5 μL) is drop-casted on a clean glass cover slide. During the
predescribed synthesis, an excess amount of F ions usually covers
the TiO2 facets. These F ions lower the surface energy
of both crystal facets, influencing their adsorption, specificity,
and reactivity.31 In order to remove them,
the crystals were annealed for 2 h at 475 °C prior to the metal
photodeposition experiments.

Photodeposition of Metal NPs
For
Pt photodeposition
experiments, the crystals were submerged in a 5 mM H2PtCl6 solution, with the solvent either a methanol/water mixture
or an EG/water mixture (alcohol concentration, 20 vol %). The prepared
samples were then irradiated with UV light for 3 min. For Au photodeposition,
the crystals were submerged in a 20 mM HAuCl4 solution
with the solvent either water or 10 vol % EG aqueous solution. The
prepared samples were then irradiated with UV light for 1 min and
thoroughly washed and dried afterward. Irradiation was conducted using
a 300 W xenon light source (Asahi-Max 303) with a 300 nm short-pass
filter. After radiation, the samples were rinsed with Milli-Q water
(18 MΩ) and gently dried with Ar. SEM measurements were performed
on a JEOL JSM-6010 InTouchScope.
