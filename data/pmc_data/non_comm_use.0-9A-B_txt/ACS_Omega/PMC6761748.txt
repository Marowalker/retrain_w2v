A water-assisted control of Pt nanoparticle
size during a surfactant-free,
microwave-assisted polyol synthesis of the carbon-supported platinum
nanoparticles (Pt/C) in a mixture of ethylene glycol and water using
(NH4)2PtCl6 as the Pt precursor is
demonstrated. The particle size was tuned between ∼2 and ∼6
nm by varying either the H2O volume percent or the Pt precursor
concentration during synthesis. The electrochemical surface area (ECSA)
and the oxygen-reduction reaction activity obtained for the Pt/C electrocatalyst
show a catalytic performance competitive to that of the state-of-the-art
commercial Pt/C electrocatalysts used for polymer electrolyte membrane
fuel cell electrodes (ECSA: ∼70 m2/g; half-wave
potential for oxygen reduction reaction: 0.83 V vs reversible hydrogen
electrode). The synthesized Pt/C electrocatalysts show durability
equivalent to or better than that of the commercial Pt/C. The durability
was found to improve with increasing particle size, with the ECSA
loss values being ∼70 and ∼55% for the particle sizes
of 2.1 and 4.3 nm, respectively. The study may be used as a route
to synthesize Pt/C electrocatalysts from a convenient and economic
Pt precursor (NH4)2PtCl6 and avoiding
the use of alkaline media.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Nanoparticulate platinum supported on carbon (Pt/C) is a key catalyst
for numerous state-of-the-art renewable energy technologies such as
the polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) fuel cells (PEMFCs) and the
PEM electrolyzers.1−5 The synthesis of Pt/C catalysts is generally achieved through various
physical, chemical, or physicochemical routes using Pt precursors
such as [PtCl6]2+.2,6−10 The metal precursor and the synthesis routes are important from
both the processing and the catalyst performance points of view. A
Pt/C synthesis route that is less costly and involves environmentally
friendly processing is preferred for the commercial production of
the catalysts. For example, use of (NH4)2PtCl6, an intermediate product of the Pt extraction/refining process,
as the Pt precursor to synthesize Pt/C electrocatalysts may be considered
a more convenient, cost-effective, and greener approach. Similarly,
as parameters such as the loading, size, surface morphology, and state
of distribution of the Pt nanoparticles affect the catalytic performance
of the Pt/C catalysts significantly,11−13 their synthesis with
desired structural parameters has remained a topic of significant
interest.14−20

The size and their agglomeration state of the Pt nanoparticles
may be controlled essentially by varying the synthesis parameters.
For example, variations of either of the parameters such as the strength
and concentration of reducing agent, the Pt precursor concentration,
presence of surfactants, etc. may be used to control the particle
size and agglomeration state of the Pt nanoparticles during their
synthesis through a chemical route.21−23 Use of surfactants such
as poly(vinylpyrrolidone) (PVP) during chemical synthesis has been
shown to control the particle size and prevent agglomeration successfully.20,24−26 However, the requirement to remove the surfactant
from the synthesized Pt/C adds extra processing steps. Hence, other
parameters such as pH of the synthesis bath, presence of water, Pt
concentration, etc. may be used to control the Pt particle size. Li
et al. have demonstrated significant effects of the pH of the solution
on carbon nanotube-supported Pt nanoparticles.27 Similarly, Schrader et al. have reported the effect of
OH– concentration of the particle size of colloidal
Pt nanoparticles synthesized through a surfactant-free polyol route
in alkaline solutions of ethylene glycol (EG).28 The particle size was found to decrease with increasing
NaOH concentration. Quinson et al. have recently shown that with a
variation in the NaOH/Pt molar ratio from 25 to 3 during a surfactant-free
synthesis in alkaline solutions of EG, the Pt nanoparticle size can
be varied from 1 to 5 nm.16 Apart from
alkaline solutions, particle size-controlled growth of Pt nanoparticles
through varying the H2O/methanol ratio during their synthesis
in aqueous solutions of methanol has also been reported.15,21,29,30 Teranishi et al. have demonstrated the synthesis of monodispersed
Pt nanoparticles of controlled size by changing the alcohol/water
and PVP/Pt ratio during alcohol reduction of H2PtCl6.21 The Pt particle size was found
to decrease with increasing alcohol or PVP concentration. Similarly,
Quinson et al. have shown the effect of the methanol/water ratio on
the Pt particle size to be dependent on the Pt concentrations of the
synthesis bath.15 At a lower Pt concentration
of 0.5 mM, the particle size remained unaffected by the methanol/water
ratio, while smaller particles were obtained for a higher methanol
content at the Pt concentration of 2.5 mM. The effect of the presence
of water on the particle size may be likely due to different reaction
pathways as demonstrated by Chen et al. that the presence of water
changes the [PtCl6]2– reduction pathway
and accelerates the reduction reaction during the synthesis of Pt
nanoparticles in a methanol/water mixture.30 Such a water-assisted control of Pt nanoparticles may be of significant
industrial importance over the use of alkaline solutions. Owing to
their industrial importance, such a simple size-controlled synthesis
of supported Pt (especially Pt/C) nanoparticles (2–5 nm) is
of interest, though optimizations at low Pt concentrations (<5
mM) may be of little significance for large-scale synthesis.

The present work aims to use the existing knowledge of water-assisted
synthesis of colloidal Pt nanoparticles of the desired size for the
large-scale synthesis of well-dispersed and size-controlled Pt/C electrocatalysts.
Here, a modified polyol route to synthesize Pt/C electrocatalysts
of the desired size has been proposed. Unlike the conventional route,
where the desired particle size and uniform distribution of Pt nanoparticles
are achieved through, for example, use of surfactants or alkaline
media (concentration up to 5 M), etc. during the synthesis of Pt/C
by reducing a Pt precursor under optimal conditions, the present study
uses water-assisted control over the particle size and particle distribution
on the carbon support. The average size of the Pt nanoparticles is
tuned by varying either of the synthesis parameters, namely, the H2O volume percent and the Pt precursor concentration, essentially
varying both the H2O/Pt and the EG/Pt molar ratios. Moreover,
the catalyst was achieved using (NH4)2PtCl6 as a precursor. Comprehensive structural and electrochemical
characterizations of the synthesized samples confirm their catalytic
performance competitive to the state-of-the-art commercial Pt/C electrocatalysts
used for PEMFC electrodes.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Propagation of the Pt/C Synthesis Reaction
Synthesis
of various Pt/C samples through the microwave (MW)-assisted
polyol route was performed in a closed vessel capable of sustaining
a pressure of up to 10 bar. As the final temperature (140 °C)
and the holding time (150 s) were maintained constant for all of the
samples, some of the samples were synthesized under supercritical
conditions with a pressure (Δp) developed in
the vessel. On changing the H2O volume fraction between
0.95 and 0.20, Δp showed a corresponding variation
between 2.5 and 0.0 bar, as shown in Table 1. The percent conversion of the [PtCl6]2– → Pt0 reduction reaction
was determined by atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS) of the residual
Pt concentration in the reaction bath after centrifuging the Pt/C
catalyst (Table 1).
The presence of H2O clearly affected the reduction reaction
significantly, leading to lower percent conversion for samples containing
H2O volume fractions below 0.10. No effect of increased
Pt concentration was observed on the percent conversion.

2.2 Structural
Characterizations of Pt/C Electrocatalysts
Microscopic analysis
of selected Pt/C catalysts through transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) reveals a uniform distribution of the Pt
nanoparticles supported on carbon. A comparison of the typical TEM
images of Pt/C catalysts synthesized with varying H2O/EG
ratios is shown in Figure 1. It suggests larger particle sizes for 95 and 00% samples
(sample code: Table 1) as compared to those for the 70 and 50% Pt/C catalysts. With a
smaller particle size (∼2 nm) and uniform distribution of the
Pt nanoparticles, the 70 and 50% Pt/C catalysts exhibit a comparable
microstructure. Moreover, the 95 and 00% samples exhibit a relatively
uneven distribution with a significant agglomeration of the Pt nanoparticles
on carbon. This particle size variation is in contrast to that observed
for the alcohol–water system, where a consistent decrease in
the particle size with increasing alcohol content during synthesis
has been reported.21 Similarly, typical
TEM images of the Pt/C catalysts synthesized by varying the Pt concentration
during synthesis shown in Figure 2 reveal significant variations in the size and agglomeration
state of the Pt nanoparticles. With increasing Pt concentration, both
the particle size and the degree of agglomeration increase significantly.

of the (a) 95%, (b) 70%, (c) 50%, and (d) 00% Pt/C catalysts
showing the effect of the H2O volume percent during syntheses
on the catalyst morphology.

Figure 2 TEM images
of the Pt/C catalysts (a, b) 05 mM, (c, d) 20 mM, and
(e, f) 30 mM, showing the effect of the Pt concentration during syntheses
on the catalyst morphology.

Further, X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the Pt/C catalysts
synthesized by varying the H2O volume percent and the Pt
concentration are shown in Figure 3a,c, respectively. The broad peak centered at 2θ
∼ 26° is attributed to the carbon support, while the relatively
intense peaks at 2θ values of 39.8, 46.1, and 67.9° correspond
to diffraction from the Pt(111), Pt(200), and Pt(220) planes, respectively.
The XRD data were analyzed further to estimate the average crystallite
size of the Pt nanoparticles. Variations of the crystallite sizes
of Pt nanoparticles for the Pt/C catalysts synthesized by varying
the H2O volume percent and the Pt concentration are shown
in Figure 3b,d, respectively.
It is clear that both the H2O volume percent as well as
the Pt concentration show significant effects on the Pt crystallite
size. Variation of the crystallite size with H2O volume
percent (Figure 3b)
suggests larger crystallite size values for the H2O volume
fractions <0.4 and >0.8 as compared to those for the H2O volume fractions between 0.4 and 0.8. This is unlike that in alkaline
electrolytes, where increasing the OH– concentration
leads to a consistent decrease in the Pt nanoparticle size.16 Further, the crystallite size variation with
the Pt concentration shown in Figure 3d suggests increasing Pt particle/agglomerate size
with increasing Pt concentration during synthesis. Combining the XRD
and TEM results, it is clear that for the 50 or 70% Pt/C catalyst,
the crystallite size matches well with the corresponding particle
size. This suggests the Pt nanoparticles to be single crystalline
with a low degree of agglomeration.

Crystallite
size variations of the Pt/C catalysts obtained from the XRD patterns
of (a) and (c) are shown in (b) and (d), respectively.

2.3 Electrochemical Performance of Pt/C Electrocatalysts
of Varying Particle Sizes
Estimating the electrochemical
surface area (ECSA) of the Pt nanoparticles (area/g of Pt; m2/gPt) through measurement of the charge associated with
certain redox peaks such as the H, CO, or Cu adsorption/stripping
is a quick and convenient route to determine their actual potential
activity.31,32 Provided the electrode structure and the
crystallinity of the Pt nanoparticles are comparable, the method may
be used to estimate the relative variation of the particle/agglomerate
size of different Pt/C samples. Figure 4 summarizes the ECSA measurement results for the Pt/C
catalysts synthesized by varying the H2O volume percent
and the Pt concentration during the MW synthesis. The current values
have been normalized to the Pt loading on the electrode measured through
X-ray fluorescence (XRF).33 The variation
among the double layer capacitance (DLC) values, i.e., the absolute
difference between cathodic and anodic currents in the double-layer
regime (∼0.5 V) for various Pt samples (Figure 4a,c), may be attributed to factors such as
small variations in the Pt/C weight ratios, changes in DLC due to
the MW-induced surface modification of the support carbon, etc. The
estimation of ECSA is made through measurement of the area under the
H adsorption peak between the double-layer region and the onset of
hydrogen evolution during a cathodic scan (shown as the gray shaded
area in the inset of Figure 4b) and using eq 1, with the specific charge for H adsorption on polycrystalline Pt
being 210 μC/cm2.34 1  Variation of the
ECSA with H2O
volume percent (Figure 4b) suggests low ECSA for both the low and the high fractions of H2O, with high ECSA for the H2O volume fractions
between 0.4 and 0.8. Further, cyclic voltammograms of the Pt/C samples
synthesized through MW treatment (time: 150 s; temp.: 140 °C;
H2O volume percent: 7/3 (v/v); Pt/C weight ratio: 1/4)
by varying the Pt concentration between 05 and 30 mM are shown in Figure 4c. The corresponding
variation of the ECSA with the Pt concentration shown in Figure 4d exhibits decreasing
ECSA values with increasing Pt concentration, with a sharp decrease
in ECSA for the Pt concentration >25 mM. The variations of the
ECSA
with both the synthesis parameters show a trend in line with the crystallite
sizes determined using XRD. Hence, the ECSA variation may be attributed
to the variation of the particle size and hence the physical surface
area, with no significant contributions from factors such as electronic
connectivity of the Pt nanoparticles, surface crystallite orientation,
etc.

Figure 4 Cyclic voltammograms of the Pt/C catalysts recorded in 1 M H2SO4 (N2 saturated) at a scan rate of
10 mV/s with variation of (a) the H2O volume percent and
(c) the Pt concentration during the MW-assisted synthesis. Corresponding
variations of the ECSA with the H2O volume percent and
the Pt concentration during the MW-assisted synthesis are shown in
(b) and (d), respectively.

Stability of the Pt/C catalysts under working conditions is affected
significantly by the Pt particle size. Electrodes consisting of larger
catalyst particles show higher durability as compared to that for
the smaller particles. Durability assessment of the selected Pt/C
catalysts was performed by subjecting the electrodes with an accelerated
stress test (AST) consisting of a potential cycling treatment (0.4–1.6
V; 1 V/s) in 1 M H2SO4 along with intermediate
measurements of the ECSA through observational cycles (0.02–1.2
V; 100 mV/s). As shown in Figure 5, Pt/C catalysts with lower ECSA (95 and 00% Pt/C catalysts)
have higher durability (retention of ECSA after AST) as compared to
that for the 70% Pt/C catalyst with lower ECSA, which are more prone
to growth through dissolution/redeposition (Ostwald ripening) under
electrochemical potential cycling.35−37

rate: 1 V/s) in 1 M H2SO4. (d) The durability
plots, i.e., the variations of the ECSA values with the number of
stress cycles for various Pt/C samples including commercial Pt/C (20
wt % Pt; BASF).

Electrochemical performance evaluation
of the Pt/C catalysts was
further supplemented by the measurement of their oxygen reduction
reaction (ORR) activity in both acidic and basic media. Linear sweep
voltammetry (LSV) plots (normalized with Pt loading on glassy carbon
rotating disc electrode (GC RDE)) of the 95, 70, and 00% Pt/C catalysts
recorded at a scan rate of 10 mV/s at a rotation speed of 1600 rpm
in 0.5 M H2SO4 and 0.1 M KOH are shown in Figure 6a,b, respectively.
In both the acidic and the basic media, the 00% Pt/C catalyst shows
the lowest half-wave potential and mass activity values, with the
specific activity being the highest (Table 2). Furthermore, despite their comparable
ECSA values, the 00% Pt/C catalyst exhibits ORR performance significantly
lower than that of the 95% Pt/C catalyst. Moreover, ORR performance
of the latter is comparable to those of the 50 and 70% Pt/C catalysts.
The different ORR performances of the 95 and the 00% Pt/C catalysts
in terms of the half-wave potentials may be due to different Pt(111),
Pt(200), and Pt(220) textures as the ORR activity is known to vary
as Pt(110) > Pt(100) > Pt(111) in H2SO4 and
as Pt(110) > Pt(111) > Pt(100) in HClO4. The Pt(111)/Pt(200)
XRD peak intensity ratios for the 00 and the 95% Pt/C catalysts are
2.14 and 2.41, respectively. The lower ORR activity of the 00% Pt/C
catalyst as compared to that for the 95% Pt/C catalyst suggests a
lower fractional contribution of the (111) facets for the former.
Further, the variation in the diffusion-limiting current around 0.4
V shows that it is related to how species travel to or leave a catalytic
surface and may be attributed to the different agglomeration states
and distributions of the Pt nanoparticles on the support carbon. For
example, relatively lower values of the diffusion-limiting current
for the 95 and 30 mM Pt/C samples may be due to large agglomerates
of the Pt nanoparticles (revealed by the respective TEM images), hindering
their accessibility to the reaction species.

samples in oxygen-saturated (a, c) acidic (0.5 M H2SO4) and (b, d) basic (0.1 M KOH) electrolytes. The voltammograms
have been recorded at a scan rate of 10 mV/s.

Further, the effect of the Pt concentration
on the ORR performance
is demonstrated by studying the ORR performances of the 05 mM, 20
mM, and 30 mM Pt/C samples. LSV curves corresponding to these Pt/C
catalysts in 0.5 M H2SO4 and 0.1 M KOH are shown,
respectively, in Figure 6c,d, while the corresponding ORR performance data have been provided
in Table 2. A decreasing
ORR performance trend with increasing Pt concentration is observed
in both acidic and basic media, which could be attributed to the increasing
particle size and/or agglomeration, as suggested by the ECSA values.

2.4 Synthesis Parameter/Material Property Correlation
Figure 7 demonstrates
the correlations between the synthesis parameters, namely the H2O/Pt and the EG/Pt molar ratios during synthesis and the material
properties, and the ECSA and the Pt crystallite size of the Pt/C catalysts.
Since the H2O/Pt and the EG/Pt molar ratios are varied
either (D1) by using different reaction bath compositions (H2O/EG ratios) with fixed Pt concentrations or (D2) by using different
Pt concentrations in reaction baths of a fixed H2O/EG ratio,
the data of material properties (ECSA and crystallite size) from these
two datasets are termed D1 and D2, respectively.

Figure 7 Correlations between
(a) H2O/Pt molar ratio and ECSA;
(b) EG/Pt molar ratio and ECSA; (c) H2O/Pt molar ratio
and crystallite size; and (d) EG/Pt molar ratio and crystallite size.
Data points for both the synthesis parameters, namely the H2O/EG ratio (D1; in red) and the Pt concentration (D2; in black),
are shown.

As shown in Figure 7, the datasets D1 and D2 follow relatively
different trends w.r.t.
the H2O/Pt molar ratio, while similar trends of D1 and
D2 are observed w.r.t. the EG/Pt ratio. Also, with identical EG/Pt
ratios (<1000), a decrease in particle size is observed with increasing
H2O/Pt ratio. In contrast, with identical H2O/Pt ratios (∼8000), an increase in particle size is observed
with increasing EG/Pt ratio. Hence, both the H2O/Pt and
the EG/Pt ratios are important to determine the Pt nanoparticle size.

As a note on the underlying mechanisms leading to the observed
particle size variation with the H2O/EG ratio, it has been
reported that in the presence of the support carbon, nanoparticles
are formed through heterogeneous nucleation on active sites of support,38 while in the absence of support (colloidal synthesis),
the particles are formed through homogeneous nucleation in the reaction
bath.39,40 Here, assuming the formation of Pt nanoparticles
through a heterogeneous nucleation route and no significant change
in the chemical route due to the fact that all of the samples (except
the 00%) have been synthesized in an H2O/EG mixture with
both H2O/Pt and EG/Pt molar ratios >150, there could
be
several physical parameters controlling the Pt nanoparticle size.
As the particle size depends on the number of stable nuclei formed
during synthesis, availability of the active sites and the reagents
are of significant importance. Hence, the particle size variation
may be explained by considering the interplay among the parameters
such as the EG/Pt ratio, the diffusivity of the [PtCl6]2– complex, and the wettability and strength of EG adsorption
on the support, with the former and the latter parameters being associated
with the availabilities of the reagents and the active sites, respectively.
A schematic illustration of the interplay of various parameters and
the Pt nanoparticle size is shown in Figure 8.

Figure 8 Schematic showing the proposed underlying mechanisms
leading to
the observed particle size variation with the H2O/EG ratio.

There are three possible scenarios:In the EG-rich condition, wettability
of the carbon
support increases with increasing EG content due to the lower surface
tension of EG as compared to that of water.41 This increases the number of active sites from the support carbon
in contact with the reaction mixture. However, blocking of the active
sites by adsorption of EG lowers the number of accessible active sites
for nucleation (Figure 8). Further, increased viscosity of the reaction mixture (and hence
low diffusivity of the [PtCl6]2– complex)
decreases the rate of formation of stable nuclei. Overall, the two
factors reduce the number of stable nuclei formed, leading to a lower
number of particles of larger size.

On
the other hand, for high water content, a small amount
of larger particles are formed due to the relatively lower number
of accessible active sites (low wettability) in contact with the reaction
mixture, leading to fewer heterogeneous nuclei, and the lower concentration
of the reducing agent, i.e., EG, leading to a decreased rate of nucleation.

Finally, for the intermediate H2O/EG contents,
relatively moderate values of wettability, viscosity, and EG adsorption
strength, along with sufficient reducing agent concentration, lead
to deposition of the smaller Pt nanoparticles by the formation and
growth of a large number of stable nuclei.



3 Conclusions
In conclusion, a water-assisted
synthesis of size-controlled Pt
nanoparticles supported on carbon (Pt/C) electrocatalysts was demonstrated.
Pt/C catalysts with 20 wt % Pt loading and a uniform distribution
of Pt nanoparticles (∼2 nm) were synthesized in the surfactant-free
aqueous solutions of ethylene glycol without additional modification
of pH. A variation in the Pt nanoparticle size from ∼2 to ∼5
nm is achieved by varying either the H2O volume percent
of the synthesis bath between 95 and 0% or the Pt concentration in
the synthesis bath between 5 and 30 mM. With a Pt nanoparticle size
of ∼2 nm, an ECSA value of ∼70 m2/g, and
a half-wave potential of 0.83 V, the electrocatalyst prepared with
an optimal H2O volume percent of 70% shows an electrocatalytic
performance comparable to that of its commercial equivalent.

4 Materials and Methods
4.1 Materials
For
the Pt/C catalyst synthesis,
Vulcan XC 72 carbon, ethylene glycol (HOCH2CH2OH; EMSURE grade, assay >99.5%, Merck, Germany), and ammonium
hexachloroplatinate
((NH4)2PtCl6, Alfa Aesar, Pt: 43.4
wt %) were used as-received. For electrochemical characterizations,
electrolytes were prepared by diluting sulfuric acid (H2SO4; EMSURE grade, assay >95–97%, Merck, Germany)
or potassium hydroxide (KOH, Sinopharm A.R. China) with ultrapure
water (Milli-Q; resistivity ≥18.2 MΩ·cm at 25 °C).

4.2 Pt/C Synthesis
A microwave (MW)-assisted
modified polyol synthesis approach was adopted to prepare the Pt/C
electrocatalysts. The CEM Discovery SP microwave synthesizer was operated
in the dynamic mode (maximum MW power: 200 W) using a closed vessel
(35 mL). In a typical Pt/C synthesis, appropriate amounts of the (NH4)2PtCl6 and Vulcan XC 72 carbon were
added to 10 mL of an ethylene glycol/milli-Q water 1:1 (v/v) mixture
to obtain a Pt/C weight ratio of 1/4. A uniform dispersion of the
reactants was performed through ultrasonication using a Hielscher
UP200St ultrasonic homogenizer for 60 s at room temperature. As shown
in Table 1, Pt/C catalysts
were synthesized by varying two of the reaction parameters, namely
the H2O volume percent and the Pt concentration, systematically,
while maintaining the reaction time (150 s) and the reaction temperature
(150 °C) constant. Optimizations on the reaction time and the
reaction temperature for the Pt/C synthesis from (NH4)2PtCl6 can be found in our previous publication.42 Constant magnetic stirring was used during the
MW treatment, while the vessel was cooled to 50 °C using compressed
air jet before opening. For the Pt concentration study, the amounts
of (NH4)2PtCl6 and Vulcan XC 72 carbon
were varied appropriately while maintaining the ethylene glycol/milli-Q
water volume ratio constant at 3/7. The synthesized Pt/C catalyst
was separated from the dispersion by centrifuging and repeated (3×)
washing with milli-Q water and dried completely at 80 °C in air.

4.3 Characterization of Pt/C
Atomic absorption
spectroscopy (AAS; Graphite Furnace Agilent 200 Series AA analyzer)
was employed to estimate the Pt concentration of the extract solution
and hence the degree of completion of the [PtCl6]2– → Pt0 reduction reaction. Morphology of the synthesized
Pt/C catalysts was unveiled through transmission electron microscope
(TEM) imaging using an FEI/Tecnai T20 TEM with an LaB6 emitter (200
kV), while their X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were collected using
a Rigaku Miniflex 600 X-ray diffractometer (Cu Kα (λ =
1.5418 Å) radiation). Crystallite size (L) values
of the Pt nanoparticles were calculated using Scherer’s formula
(L = 0.9λ/β cos θ,
with λ, θ, and β being the X-ray wavelength, the
diffraction angle, and the full width at half maximum (FWHM) (2Δθ),
respectively) by using the most intense Pt (111) diffraction peak
at 2θ = 39.9°. For determination of the FWHM, the XRD data
for 2θ values between 35 and 45° were fitted with Gaussian
distributions for 2 peaks at 2θ ∼ 39.8 and ∼46.1°,
corresponding, respectively, to the Pt (111) and Pt (200) planes.

Electrochemical characterizations of the Pt/C samples were performed
for assessment of the electrochemical surface area (ECSA), durability,
and oxygen-reduction reaction (ORR) activity parameters. For catalyst
ink preparation, the Pt/C catalyst (10 mg) was dispersed ultrasonically
(Hielscher UP200St ultrasonic homogenizer; 60 s) in a stock solution
(5 mL) consisting of isopropanol (20 vol %), 5 wt % Nafion solution
(Dupont D521), from Ion Power (0.4 vol %), and Milli-Q water (79.6
vol %). The typical working electrode (WE) was prepared by spin coating
(rpm: 700, time: 30 min) 10 μL of the catalyst ink on a glassy
carbon (GC) rotating disc electrode (RDE; Φ = 5 mm; Pine instruments)
polished with 0.5 μm alumina. Accurate determination of the
Pt loadings on the WE was performed using an X-ray fluorescence (XRF)
analyzer (Thermo Scientific Niton XL3t GOLDD+), calibrated for the
same.33

The ECSA and durability measurements
of the Pt/C catalysts were
performed through an accelerated stress test (AST) using a ZahnerIM6e
electrochemical workstation in 1 M H2SO4 (N2 saturated) electrolyte using a three-electrode setup, comprising
of the modified GC RDE as WE, a graphitic carbon rod (Φ = 5
mm) as a counter electrode (CE), and a Hg/Hg2SO4 (REF 601 Radiometer) reference electrode (RE). Before the AST, the
WE was subjected to an activation treatment through potential cycling
between 0.02 and 1.2 V at a scan rate of 100 mV/s for 20 cycles in
the same electrolyte. During AST, the WE was subjected to a sequence
of observational and stress cycles through linear sweep potential
cycling with a total of 1600 stress cycles between 0.4 and 1.6 V at
a scan rate of 1 V/s along with intermediate observational cycles
(2 cycles) between 1.2 and 0.02 V at a scan rate of 10 mV/s. ECSA
was estimated by measuring the area under the H+ adsorption
peak during the cathodic scan. Finally, the variation of the ECSA
with the number of stress cycles (N), as assessed
through the intermediate observational cycles, was used as the measure
of the catalyst durability.

Further, ORR activity measurements
of the Pt/C catalysts in acidic
(0.5 M H2SO4) and basic (0.1 M KOH) electrolytes
were performed through linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) with a multichannel
potentiostat (Biologic VMP3 France) and a PINE RDE system. A catalyst-coated
glassy carbon (GC) electrode (Φ = 5 mm), a carbon rod, and a
saturated calomel electrode were used, respectively, as WE, CE, and
RE in 0.5 M H2SO4 electrolyte, while in 0.1
M KOH electrolyte, an Hg/HgO electrode was used as RE. LSV voltammograms
were recorded at a scan rate of 10 mV/s and a rotation speed of 1600
rpm after purging the electrolyte with O2 for 15 min every
time. For ease of comparison, all of the potential values were converted
to vs reversible hydrogen electrode.
