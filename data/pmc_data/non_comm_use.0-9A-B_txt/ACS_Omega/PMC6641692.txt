In
this article, a three-dimensional chemically reduced graphene
oxide/polypyrrole nanotubes (PPy nanotubes)/Fe3O4 aerogel (GPFA) was fabricated by a simple one-step self-assembly
process through hydrothermal reduction. The addition of both PPy nanotubes
and Fe3O4 nanoparticles is aimed to avoid the
aggregation of graphene sheets, effectively adjust the permittivity,
and make better impedance matching between dielectric loss and magnetic
loss of the composite aerogel to gain excellent electromagnetic (EM)
wave absorption performance. The EM wave-absorbing results indicate
that the ternary composite with an ultralow density of about 38.3
mg/cm3 shows an improved EM wave-absorbing property with
a maximum reflection loss of −49.2 dB at the frequency of 11.8
GHz, with an effective absorption bandwidth below −10 dB reaching
6.1 GHz (9.8–15.9 GHz) at a thickness of 3.0 mm. Such an outstanding
EM wave absorption behavior can be attributed to the multiple reflections,
polarizations, and relaxation processes in the aerogel.

1 Introduction
Electromagnetic
(EM) wave-absorbing materials are becoming significantly
important because of the increasing use of electronic devices.1,2 Nowadays, EM wave-absorbing materials with intense absorption ability,
broad absorption bandwidth, ultralight weight, and thin thickness
are in high demand.3,4 Recently, graphene has been widely
used as an EM wave-absorbing material because of its excellent properties,
such as low density, high specific surface area, large aspect ratios,
and versatile processing.5,6 According to the EM
energy conversion principle, a proper matching between the dielectric
loss and the magnetic loss determines the reflection and attenuation
characteristics of EM wave absorbers. Nevertheless, graphene is found
to be nonmagnetic, and the EM wave absorption properties are mostly
attributed to the dielectric loss. Moreover, the EM wave absorption
of graphene materials can also be limited by their improper electrical
conductivity. Therefore, composites of graphene with other lossy materials
have been widely explored as an approach to enhance the EM wave-absorbing
performance.7−10

One of the effective ways to solve this problem is to couple
graphene
with magnetic materials, such as Fe3O4,11−13 Co3O4,14 and NiFe2O4.15 In addition, conducting
polymers with excellent physical and chemical properties can also
be used as EM wave absorbers. Over the past decades, considerable
attention has been paid to the EM wave absorption properties of conducting
polymers.16−18 Polypyrrole (PPy), one of the most extensively studied
conducting polymers, has attracted great interest in EM wave absorber
construction for its lightweight, high electrical conductivity, and
favorable physicochemical properties.19−21 Recently, the ternary
composites of graphene/Fe3O4/polyaniline (PANI),22 reduced graphene oxide (RGO)–PPy–Co3O4,23 and RGO–poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)
(PEDOT)–Co3O418 have been studied because of their multifunctional EM wave dissipation
paths. However, the fabrication process is complicated, and there
may be aggregation problem because of the strong π–π
interaction between graphene sheets in the reduction process. The
aggregation can reduce the surface area and decrease the conductivity
of graphene and thus lead to inferior EM wave-absorbing properties.

Construction of a three-dimensional (3D) graphene network from
individual graphene sheets paves a new way to address the aggregation
problems.24−26 Furthermore, 3D graphene still maintains super properties
of graphene sheets, which will guarantee the promising applications
including EM wave absorption. For instance, Wang et al. fabricated
graphene aerogels (GAs) constructed from interconnected graphene nanosheet-coated
carbon fibers via a simple dip-coating method, and the composite aerogels
showed a minimum reflection loss (RL) value of −30.53 dB at
14.6 GHz with the bandwidth of RL less than −10 dB of 4.1 GHz
at a thickness of 1.5 mm. Song et al. prepared a 3D hierarchical RGO
foam decorated with in situ grown ZnO nanowires (ZnOnws), and the
ZnOnws/RGO foam/polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) composite with 3.3 wt
% absorber loading attained a minimum RL value of −27.8 dB
at 9.57 GHz at a thickness of 4.8 mm, possessing a wide effective
absorption bandwidth of 4.2 GHz covering the whole X band. In this
paper, the vacuum infusion method was employed to transfer wax into
3D RGO/PPy nanotube/Fe3O4 networks to avoid
damaging the 3D structure, as for instance when mechanically mixing
fillers in a matrix. Meanwhile, it can be anticipated that the introduction
of PPy nanotubes can not only act as a spacer to avoid the stacking
of graphene sheets in the reduction process but also adjust the dielectric
properties of GA. Moreover, the addition of Fe3O4 nanoparticles is aimed to make better impedance matching between
the dielectric loss and the magnetic loss. What is more, the RGO/PPy
nanotube/Fe3O4 aerogels (GAFAs) can be facilely
fabricated through a simple one-step self-assembly process through
hydrothermal reduction. It shows promising EM wave-absorbing performance
with an ultralow density of 38.3 mg/cm3, and the results
and mechanisms of microwave absorption of the composite aerogel are
discussed in detail in this paper.

2 Experimental
Section
2.1 Materials
GO was prepared by a modified
Hummers’ method.27 All the chemicals
and reagents were of analytical grade and were used as received without
any purification. Deionized water was produced in our laboratory and
was used for all experiments.

2.2 Synthesis
of Fe3O4 Nanoparticles
The Fe3O4 nanoparticles were prepared according
to the procedure reported in refs (28) and (29). In detail, 5.2 g of FeCl3 (32 mmol) and 3.18
g of FeCl2·4H2O (16 mmol) were dissolved
into 25 mL of deionized water with 0.86 mL of HCl, and then the mixture
was added dropwise into 250 mL of 1.5 M NaOH aqueous solution under
vigorous stirring. A black precipitate was obtained by centrifugation
at 6000 rpm (3 min), and then the precipitate was washed three times
with deionized water. Subsequently, 250 mL of a 0.01 M HCl solution
was added to neutralize the anionic charges on the nanoparticles.
The cationic Fe3O4 nanoparticles were collected
by centrifugation at 10 000 rpm (10 min) and then freeze-dried for
48 h.

2.3 Preparation of PPy Nanotubes
PPy
nanotubes were prepared according to the procedure reported in the
lietraure.3,30 In a typical procedure, FeCl3 (1.944 g) was dissolved into 250 mL of MO (sodium 4-[4′-(dimethylamino)phenyldiazo]phenylsulfonate
(CH3)2NC6H4N=NC6H4SO3Na) (0.392 g) deionized water solution.
A flocculent precipitate appeared immediately. Then, a certain amount
of pyrrole monomer (0.84 mL) was added dropwise into it, and the mixture
was softly stirred at room temperature for 24 h. The as-prepared precipitate
was obtained by filtering and washed several times with ethanol and
water alternately to remove impurities. After that, the product was
freeze-dried for 48 h and then dried at 60 °C for 12 h to finally
obtain the PPy nanotubes.

2.4 Fabrication of RGO/PPy
Nanotube/Fe3O4 Aerogels (GPFAs)
As
schematically shown in Figure 1, the GPFAs were
prepared by a simple one-step self-assembly process through hydrothermal
reduction. First, a certain amount of PPy nanotubes (0.12 g) was added
into 20 mL of GO solution (6 mg/mL), followed by vigorous stirring
for 6 h. Then, the prepared Fe3O4 nanoparticles
(0.12 g) were added into the mixture and stirred for another 6 h to
form a uniform compound. After dropping hydrazine hydrate (300 μL)
into the above suspension, the composite was sealed into a 25 mL glass
vial and placed in an oven heated to 95 °C for 12 h. Subsequently,
the resulting hydrogel was taken out and washed several times with
ethanol and deionized water to remove impurities and then freeze-dried
for 48 h to obtain the GAFA. For comparison, GA, RGO/Fe3O4 aerogel (GFA), and RGO/PPy nanotube aerogel (GPA) were
synthesized under the same condition as described above. The calculated
densities of GA, GFA, GPA, and GPFA were approximately 16.6, 31.2,
29.0, and 38.3 mg/cm3, respectively.

Figure 1 Schematic fabrication
process of GPFA.

The paraffin wax with
a melting point of about 52–54 °C
was used as the matrix. The 3D GPFA/wax samples were prepared by a
vacuum-assistant filling method. First, the paraffin wax was heated
to 90 °C and completely melted. Then, the 3D GPFA was immersed
into the melted wax until the network was saturated with liquid wax.
After that, the sample was put under vacuum for 10 min to remove the
air bubbles trapped in the composites. Finally, the 3D GPFA/wax samples
were cooled down and kept at room temperature for 5 h. For GA, GFA,
GPA, and GPFA composites, their weight ratios were calculated as 1.81,
3.35, 3.12, and 4.08 wt %, respectively.

2.5 Characterization
and Testing
X-ray
diffraction (XRD) spectra were acquired by D/MAX2550/PC using Cu Kα
radiation from 8° to 70° at a scan rate of 5°·min–1 under 35 kV and 200 mA. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS) was recorded using a Kratos AXIS Ultra DLD spectrometer. Raman
spectra were taken on a SENTERRA R200 Raman spectrometer with a 532
nm laser excitation. Nitrogen absorption and desorption measurements
were performed with an Autosorb iQ instrument. The surface areas were
calculated by the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method.
Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy was carried out by
an FTIR spectrophotometer (Bruck EQUINOX55) using the KBr method over
a frequency range of 400–4000 cm–1. The morphology
of samples was characterized by the transmission electron microscope
(JEM-2100F, JEOL, Tokyo, Japan) and the field-emission scanning electron
microscope (FEI-Sirion 200). The composite specimens prepared for
EM wave absorption measurement were toroidal-shaped samples with an
outer diameter of 7.00 mm and an inner diameter of 3.00 mm. The complex
permittivity and permeability values were recorded using an Agilent
85050D vector network analyzer in the frequency range of 2–18
GHz.

3 Results and Discussion
The morphology
and structure of the fabricated composite aerogels
were observed by scanning electron microscope (SEM) and transmission
electron microscopy (TEM), respectively, as shown in Figures 2 and 3. Figure 2a shows
the spectra of the prepared GPFA, which can be fabricated into any
shape to meet the specific requirement in practical applications depending
on the vessels used. We have tested the mechanical property of the
composite aerogel, as shown in Figure S1. The results indicate that it can be at least 153 times larger than
its own weight, thus resulting in good compression strength. Moreover,
the magnetic property of the GPFA composite was also tested, and the
results are shown in Figure S3. It can
be observed that the as-prepared PPy nanotubes exhibit a diameter
of about 50–100 nm with a length of 5–10 μm (Figures 2b and 3a). In Figure 2d, it can be found that the prepared GPFA exhibits a 3D interconnected
porous network structure with an average pore diameter of about several
to tens of micrometers. The PPy nanotubes are uniformly attached on
the surface of RGO sheets, and meanwhile, some are dispersed between
RGO sheets, which is helpful to avoid the aggregation of RGO sheets
in the hydrothermal reduction process (Figures 2c,e and 3c). The Fe3O4 nanoparticles with some clusters are anchored
homogeneously on the surface of RGO sheets and PPy nanotubes with
a diameter of about 10–30 nm (Figures 2e and 3b–d).
To verify the crystalline structure of Fe3O4 particles, high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image of GPFA is presented
in Figure 3d. It is
clear that the lattice fringe space of Fe3O4 particles is about 0.253 nm, corresponding to the (311) plane of
Fe3O4, which is in agreement with the XRD analysis,
and the selected area electron diffraction pattern (inset in Figure 3d) further demonstrates
their polycrystalline feature. The 3D porous structure and the uniform
distribution of PPy nanotubes and Fe3O4 nanoparticles
can be favorable for the composite aerogel’s EM wave absorption
behavior.

image of (d) Fe3O4 nanoparticles.

The structures of the synthesized GO, RGO, PPy
nanotubes, Fe3O4 nanoparticles, and GPFA were
investigated by
XRD, as shown in Figure 2f. A broad peak at about 25° is observed for RGO, when compared
with GO, whose XRD peak appears at about 10.3°, which indicates
that GO has been effectively reduced to graphene.31,32 The synthesized PPy nanotubes possess an amorphous structure showing
a broad XRD peak around 21.8°.17,21 For Fe3O4 nanoparticles, diffraction peaks at 30.21, 35.61,
43.31, 57.31, and 62.91 are observed and can be assigned to the (220),
(311), (400), (511), and (440) planes of Fe3O4, which is similar to the standard pattern of Fe3O4 (JCPDS card no. 19-0629).33 The
relatively weak intensity demonstrates that the prepared Fe3O4 particles are small. For GPFAs, the Fe3O4 XRD peaks can be found as described above, and only a slight
broad peak for RGO and PPy can be observed, which may be due to their
relatively low diffraction intensity.

Figure 4a shows
the XPS spectra of GPFA, indicating the presence of C, N, O, and Fe
elements in the composite aerogel. Figure 4b shows the C 1s XPS spectra of GO and RGO.
For GO, four different peaks centered at 284.8, 286.6, 287.6, and
289.1 eV, which correspond to C=C/C–C, C–O, C=O,
and O–C=O, respectively, can be observed, and for RGO,
the intensity of the oxygen-containing peaks greatly decreases, demonstrating
a considerable reduction of GO.34 Meanwhile,
a new peak centered at 285.7 eV, which is attributed to the C–N
group, can be found, suggesting the presence of PPy nanotubes.23 The N 1s peak can be divided into three Gaussian
peaks with binding energies of 398.2, 399.7, and 401.4 eV, respectively
(Figure 4c), which
are from the neutral and imine-like structure (−C=N−),
the neutral and amine-like structure (−N–H−),
and positively charged nitrogen atoms (−NH+−)
of the PPy nanotubes as described in the literature.18,33,35 As shown in Figure 4d, the core-level binding energies
at 709.8 and 723.9 eV are the characteristic doublets of Fe 2p3/2 and Fe 2p1/2, respectively.33 These results indicate the successful fabrication of GPFAs.

Figure 4 (a) Full
XPS spectrum and (b) C 1s, (c) N 1s, and (d) Fe 2p XPS
core-level spectra of GPFA.

The Raman spectra of RGO and GPFA are shown in Figure 5a. For the GPFA, the characteristic
Raman scattering peak for Fe3O4 powder appears
at around 673 cm–1 (inset figure), which corresponds
to the A1g mode.29 For PPy nanotubes,
the broad peak obtained near 1065 cm–1 corresponds
to the C–H in-plane deformation and two small peaks near 921
and 980 cm–1 are associated with the quinoid polaronic
and bipolaronic structure, indicating the successful formation of
PPy.23,41 The peaks at 1343 and 1578 cm–1 are the characteristic peaks of the D and G bands from graphene,
which are associated with disordered carbon and the sp2-hybridized carbon, respectively.23,41 Compared to
the pure RGO aerogel, the shift of the peaks can be found for both
D and G bands, indicating a significant charge transfer between the
graphene nanosheets and Fe3O4 nanoparticles.29 Moreover, the enhanced intensity of GPFA for
the G band around 1575 cm–1 reflects the interaction
between the π-conjugated nanotubes and aromatic graphene basal
plane.23,41 The interactions among graphene sheets,
PPy nanotubes, and Fe3O4 nanoparticles are helpful
in improving its EM wave-absorbing performance.

Figure 5 (a) Raman spectra of
RGO and GPFA and (b) FT-IR spectra of GO,
RGO, PPy nanotube, Fe3O4 nanoparticle, and GPFA.

The FT-IR spectra of the prepared
GO, RGO, PPy nanotubes, Fe3O4 nanoparticles,
and GPFA are shown in Figure 5b. For pure GO, the
curve is very similar to that obtained in the previous work,23,36 and the peaks centered at 1729, 1223, and 1053 cm–1 are associated with group C=O, epoxy C–O, and alkoxy
C–O stretching vibration, respectively. The broad band of −OH
stretching vibration appearing at 3419 cm–1 can
be attributed to the vibration of the adsorbed water molecules. For
RGO, most of the peaks related with the oxygen-containing functional
groups disappear, indicating an effective reduction of GO. For PPy
nanotubes, the strong peaks near 1314 and 1038 cm–1 are ascribed to C–N stretching and C–H deformation
vibrations, and the peaks centered at 1181 and 912 cm–1 indicate the doping state of PPy.17,23 For Fe3O4, the characteristic absorption peaks at 633
and 582 cm–1 corresponding to the Fe–O bond
can be observed.37,38 The main peaks of PPy and Fe3O4 can all be found in the spectra of GPFA, indicating
the successful preparation of GPFA. Furthermore, for Fe3O4, the corresponding peaks are upshifted about 33 and
36 cm–1 and for the PPy nanotube, the corresponding
peaks are upshifted about 24, 7, 23, and 27 cm–1. This phenomenon is probably attributed to the π–π
interactions and hydrogen bonding among the RGO, aromatic PPy rings,
and the Fe3O4 nanoparticles, which is beneficial
for the enhancement of the composite aerogel’s EM wave absorption
property.

The porous structure of the RGO aerogel and GPFA is
further validated
by nitrogen physisorption measurements, and the results are shown
in Figure 6. Clearly,
for both GA and GPFA, the N2 adsorption–desorption
isotherms exhibit the type II hysteresis loop, characteristic to pores
with different pore sizes.39,40 The BET surface areas
of the GA and GPFA are determined to be 149 and 305 m2 g–1, respectively. Moreover, the pore size distribution
of GA calculated by the density functional theory method indicates
a large proportion of mesopores with distribution from 2.5 to 20 nm
with a peak pore diameter of approximately 2.8 nm (Figure 6b). For GPFA, the relative
quantity of pore diameter exceeding 3 nm is largely increased with
a maximum pore diameter of about 2.7 nm. It can be found that with
the addition of PPy nanotubes, GPFA possesses larger surface area
and pore diameter compared with GA, which proves that the PPy nanotubes
can act as a spacer between graphene sheets and could effectively
reduce the aggregation of graphene sheets during the chemical reduction
process.

distribution plot of GA and GPFA.

As is well-known, the EM wave-absorbing properties of the
materials
can be estimated by the RL curves. According to the classical transmission
line theory, the RL values can be calculated by the following equations:2 1   2  where c is the velocity of
light, d is the thickness of the absorber, f is the wave frequency, and εr and μr are the measured relative complex permittivity and permeability
of the composite absorber, respectively.26

Figure 7a–d
shows the RL curves of GA, GFA, GPA, and GPFA with different thicknesses
at 2–18 GHz. The maximum RL of the samples obviously shifts
to lower frequency with the thickness increasing from 2.0 to 5.0 mm.
As is known, the matching conditions are given as follows: 3  where dm is the
best matching thickness, c is the velocity of light
in free space, and fm is the best matching
frequency. Therefore, the EM wave absorption properties can be tuned
by adjusting the thickness of the samples according to specific applications.3 In Figure 7, the maximum RL values of GA, GFA, GPA, and GPFA are −37.8
dB at 7.8 GHz with a thickness of 4.5 mm, −47.1 dB at 8.15
GHz with a thickness of 4.5 mm, −40.2 dB at 9.35 GHz with a
thickness of 3.5 mm, and −49.2 dB at 11.8 GHz with a thickness
of 3 mm, and moreover, the bandwidths of RL below −10 dB are
3.7, 4.3, 3.95, and 6.1 GHz in the range of 6.2–9.9, 6.65–10.95,
7.75–11.7, and 9.8–15.9 GHz, respectively. It can be
found that the addition of both Fe3O4 nanoparticles
and PPy nanotubes is helpful to improve the EM wave-absorbing property
of the RGO aerogel, and furthermore, the ternary GPFA exhibits the
best EM wave absorption performance because of the introduction of
multiple dissipation ways. For comparison, we crushed the GPFA into
powders and mixed with wax to obtain the sample GPFA-S, which possessed
the same mass ratio as the sample GPFA. The EM wave absorption properties
of the sample GPFA-S were tested, and the results are shown in Figure S2. In addition, the EM wave-absorbing
behavior of GPFA is compared with other previous works as listed in Table 1, and the results
indicate that the composite aerogel can be used as good EM wave absorption
materials.

different thicknesses from 2 to 5 mm in the frequency range of 2–18
GHz.

As described in the above
equations, the RL is significantly influenced
by relative complex permittivity (εr) and permeability
(μr) of the test sample. To investigate the possible
EM wave absorption mechanism of the above samples, we measured the
relative complex permittivity and permeability of the samples, and
the variation curves of complex permittivity real parts (ε′)
and imaginary parts (ε″) and complex permeability real
parts (μ′) and imaginary parts (μ″) are
shown in Figure 8.
As shown in Figure 8a, for samples GA, GFA, GPA, and GPFA, the values of ε′
decrease with increasing frequency from 8.38 to 3.22, 7.46 to 3.62,
9.42 to 4.56, and 8.66 to 4.02. For GPFA, the addition of highly conductive
PPy nanotubes can obviously increase the ε′ values when
compared with GA and GFA. Moreover, compared to GPA, the addition
of Fe3O4 nanoparticles can decrease GPFA’s
ε′ value to some extent, which is helpful to improve
the impedance match and lead to weak reflection and good absorption.23,33 In Figure 8a, the
aerogels exhibit similar ε″ values, which decrease with
increasing frequency with fluctuations between 4.36 and 1.84 in the
frequency range of 2–18 GHz.

Figure 8 (a) Real part (εr′) and imaginary part (εr″) of the
complex relative permittivity, (b) real part (μr′) and imaginary
part (μr″) of the complex relative permeability, and (c) the loss tangent
of different aerogels in the range of 2–18 GHz.

As far as we know, there are two types of contributions
for EM
wave absorption: dielectric loss and magnetic loss.14Figure 8b shows the real and imaginary parts of the complex permeability
measured for the aerogels. For all samples, the values of both the
real and imaginary parts of the complex permeability are small when
compared with complex permittivity, indicating minor magnetic loss
contributions to the EM wave absorption observed above.18,23 On the basis of the EM parameters, the dielectrical dissipation
factor (tan δε) and the magnetic dissipation factor (tan
δμ) could be calculated. Generally, apart from dielectric
loss and magnetic loss, another important concept relating to excellent
EM wave absorption is the efficient complementarity between the relative
permittivity and permeability.23,33 As shown in Figure 8c, the ternary GPFA
consisting of RGO sheets, PPy nanotubes, and Fe3O4 nanoparticles shows better impedance matching between the dielectric
loss and the magnetic loss than other samples, which leads to best
EM wave absorption properties. To further study the EM wave absorption
performance of GPFAs, samples with different amounts of PPy nanotubes
were prepared, and their EM wave absorption properties are compared
with GPFA, as shown in Figures S4 and S5.

The incident EM wave is dissipated
into heat by the 3D porous GPFA,
as shown schematically in Figure 9. The 3D porous structure of the aerogel can easily
trap the incident EM wave inside and make a longer propagation path
in the absorber by multiple reflections and more scattering among
the graphene sheets, PPy nanotubes, and Fe3O4 nanoparticles, which results in more dissipation of EM energy.2,3,17,20 In addition, the introduction of PPy nanotubes and Fe3O4 nanoparticles not only leads to more electron polarization,
interfacial polarization, and magnetic loss but also generates an
efficient complementarity between the relative permittivity and permeability,
which plays an important role in increasing the EM absorption properties.18,33 In addition, PPy nanotubes and Fe3O4 nanoparticles
attached on twisted graphene sheets provide RGO sheets with more defects,
and thus, the composite will introduce more defect polarization relaxation
processes.3 Because the calculated density
of GPFA is about 38.3 mg/cm3, it can be used as good ultralight
EM wave absorption materials.

mechanism for
the GPFA composite.

4 Conclusions
In this article, a 3D GPFA was fabricated by a simple one-step
reduction self-assembly process. The PPy nanotubes can act as a spacer
to avoid the aggregation of graphene sheets and adjust the permittivity
of the composite aerogel. Moreover, the addition of Fe3O4 nanoparticles can make better impedance matching between
the dielectric loss and the magnetic loss of the aerogel to gain excellent
EM wave absorption performance. The EM wave-absorbing results indicate
that the ternary aerogel with an ultralow density of about 38.3 mg/cm3 shows an improved EM wave absorption performance with a maximum
RL of −49.2 dB at the frequency of 11.8 GHz, and the effective
absorption bandwidth below −10 dB can reach 6.1 GHz (9.8–15.9
GHz) at a thickness of 3.0 mm. Such an outstanding EM wave absorption
behavior can be attributed to the multiple reflections, polarizations,
and relaxation processes in the aerogel. Therefore, GPFA can be used
as an attractive candidate for EM wave absorbers.
