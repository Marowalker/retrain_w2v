Dendrimer
nanocarriers are unique hyper-branched polymers with
biomolecule-like properties, representing a promising prospect as
a nucleic acid delivery system. The design of effective dendrimer-based
gene carriers requires considering several parameters, such as carrier
morphology, size, molecular weight, surface chemistry, and flexibility/rigidity.
In detail, the rational design of the dendrimer surface chemistry
has been ascertained to play a crucial role on the efficiency of interaction
with nucleic acids. Within this framework, advances in the field of
organic chemistry have allowed us to design dendrimers with even small
difference in the chemical structure of their surface terminals. In
this study, we have selected two different cationic phosphorus dendrimers
of generation 3 functionalized, respectively, with pyrrolidinium (DP)
and morpholinium (DM) surface groups, which have demonstrated promising
potential for short interfering RNA (siRNA) delivery. Despite DP and
DM differing only for one atom in their chemical structure, in vitro
and in vivo experiments have highlighted several differences between
them in terms of siRNA complexation properties. In this context, we
have employed coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulation techniques
to shed light on the supramolecular characteristics of dendrimer–siRNA
complexation, the so-called dendriplex formations. Our data provide
important information on self-assembly dynamics driven by surface
chemistry and competition mechanisms.

==== Body
Introduction
RNA-based
drugs, including short interfering RNA (siRNA) molecules,1 are particularly promising examples of a modern
medicine doctrine approach,2 conceived
to minimize side effects. Despite encouraging results shown using
siRNA-mediated treatments,3,4 cellular uptake still
represents the major issue in the development of effective siRNA therapies.
The poor internalization of siRNAs across cell membranes is due to
their high molecular weight and negative charge.5 To efficiently achieve intracellular delivery, siRNAs are
usually complexed with cationic molecules which generate complexes
with a size ranging from tens to a few hundreds of nanometers.6 Several polymeric and lipid nanocarriers have
been developed in the literature, including chitosan, cationic lipids,
polyethyleneimine, and dendrimers.7−14 In the field of siRNA delivery, cationic phosphorous dendrimers15−18 have proven to be excellent drug carriers for gene-silencing treatments
after in vitro and in vivo experiments.4,6,19−21 In a previous study,22 we focused the attention on two different cationic
phosphorus dendrimers of generation 3 for siRNA delivery.6 Those dendrimers were functionalized, respectively,
with pyrrolidinium (DP) and morpholinium (DM) surface groups.6,22

Several differences between DP and DM have been highlighted
in
terms of interaction properties with siRNA molecules by both in vitro
experiments and molecular modeling. In detail, in vitro experiments
indicated DP to have a multivalent character because it efficiently
binds more than one siRNA molecule because of its ability to maximize
the entropic contribution to the complexation free energy (CFE).22 In addition, DP has also a lower enthalpy contribution
to the CFE because of the lower recruitment of its charged terminals,
which intrinsically maximizes the ability to complex with more than
one siRNA.22 Contrariwise, DM has higher
enthalpy contribution to the CFE because it involves a higher number
of its charged terminals, which de facto disadvantages the complexation
with multiple siRNAs.22 All aforementioned
characteristics in fact strongly influence the stoichiometric number
of DP and DM, resulting in a different supramolecular binding behavior.

Although atomistic modeling provided a clear picture of how functionalization
may drive dendrimer ability to bind siRNA, a complete exploration
of dendrimer–siRNA aggregation phenomena is still missing.
In particular, to deeply explore the overall dendrimer–siRNA
complexation dynamics, molecular systems consisting of more than one
siRNA and/or one dendrimer should be simulated. All-atom (AA) molecular
dynamics (MD) simulations have limited ability to approach large systems
such as supramolecular assemblies and microsecond dynamics of those
assemblies. An interesting approach to overcome the abovementioned
limitations is the so-called coarse-grained (CG) modeling, which allows
to investigate the conformational behavior of supramolecular assemblies
and dynamics of microseconds with a reasonable computational effort.23 Within this context, MARTINI CG force field
has found a broad range of applications because it combines speed
and versatility while maintaining chemical specificity.24−26 MARTINI forcefield has been already applied to model PAMAM27,28 or poly(l-lysine) dendrimers29 and their interaction with the cellular membrane.30−33

In the present study, we
carried out CG-MD simulations to provide
further crucial information on DP and DM self-assembly phenomena and
interaction propensity to siRNA. Our data confirmed how even small
changes of the dendrimer surface chemistry may strongly affect the
dendrimer interaction mechanism with siRNA, providing a view on how
those small chemical changes on the dendrimer surface affect at higher
scales the dendriplex superassembly stability. The outcome of this
research provides (i) a characterization of DP and DM dendriplexes6,17 and (ii) information to rationally design/optimize the dendrimer
surface for tailoring dendrimer–siRNA drug-delivery systems.

Results
In this section, we will show the results regarding the dendrimers
self-assembly properties, stoichiometric coefficients, and competition
mechanisms.

T1. Dendrimer Self-Aggregation Mechanisms
Recent in
vitro experiments from our previous work22 highlighted a DP tendency to self-assemble. Here, we have carried
out CG simulations to investigate molecular mechanisms describing
this behavior (section Methods, category T1). Figure 1A shows the percentage
of self-assembled dendrimers. The probability of DP dendrimer to aggregate
(70%) was found much higher if compared to DM (30%). Moreover, buried
surface (BS) estimation was carried out to evaluate the interacting
surface of complexed dendrimers. Figure 1B indicates a quite similar total BS (DP
= 9.55 ± 0.98 nm2, DM = 8.80 ± 1.15 nm2) for both DM and DP. As expected, DP–DP complexes were characterized
by a slightly higher hydrophobic BS (DP = 9.02 ± 0.97 nm2, DM = 7.03 ± 0.99 nm2) and a lower hydrophilic
contact area (DP = 0.53 ± 0.18 nm2, DM = 1.77 ±
0.38 nm2) with respect to DM–DM complexes. The greater
tendency shown by DP to interact by hydrophobic contacts is likely
driven by apolar terminals on the outer surface. The increased buried
hydrophobic area of DP promotes the self-assembly phenomena, in agreement
with experimental data.

Figure 1 Percentage of simulation frames in which dendrimers
are found complexed
(DP–DP or DM–DM) or free in solution (A). The last 50
ns of all replicas for each dendrimer type were considered as an ensemble
trajectory. DP has demonstrated a greater self-aggregation behavior,
as it occurs in 70% of the frames; in contrast, DM has exhibited lower
attitude to self-aggregate, which occurs in only 30% of the frames.
Picture (B) shows the BS between homologous DMs and DPs. In this chart,
the hydrophobic variation between the 2DP and 2DM systems is emphasized,
which may be the driving force of DP tighter self-assembly.

In addition to the previously BS analysis, dendrimer
solvent accessible
surface area (SASA) has been also computed in order to clarify the
percentage of the dendrimer surface involved in the self-assembly
process. Table 1 shows
the SASA analysis and the BS/SASA ratio for both the dendrimer type,
dividing results in three main categories: total, hydrophobic, and
hydrophilic. Accordingly to the Figure 1B bar diagram, the BS/SASA ratio is in perfect correlation
with the interaction surface of the dendrimer assembly. Despite DP
has lower total SASA, it involves a higher interaction surface, resulting
in a higher percentage of the BS/SASA ratio.

T2. siRNA–Dendrimer
Binding Stoichiometry
In
vitro experiments and AA simulations suggested DP–siRNA stoichiometry
higher than 2, whereas DM–siRNA stoichiometry lower than 1,
which definitively crown the DP dendrimer as the most efficient nanocarrier.
In this work, an extensive CG-MD investigation was carried out to
deeply elucidate molecular reasons behind this feature (set up described
in section Methods, category T2). Overall,
15 replicas of 500 ns were carried out for each system, considering
the last 50 ns for all the following analyses. Figure 2A shows the probability of each dendrimer
to be in contact with 1 and 2 siRNA, respectively. Results indicated
that DP was able to maximize the probability to bind 2 siRNA molecules
(78.6% of the MD frames—Supporting Movie 1), if compared with DM (36.1% of the MD frames—Supporting Movie 2). Figure 2B shows the BS, that is, the interaction surface, between
dendrimer and siRNA in stable dendriplex assemblies. In these CG-MD
simulations, dendriplex can be composed by 1 dendrimer and 1 siRNA
or 1 dendrimer and 2 siRNA. The BS was always larger in case of DM–siRNA
dendriplex (DM–1 siRNA = 16.89 ± 4.20 nm2,
DM–2 siRNA = 24.46 ± 6.11 nm2; DP–1
siRNA = 8.25 ± 1.18 nm2, DP–2 siRNA = 18.69
± 4.15 nm2). It is worth noting that BS is 2.27 higher
in case of DP binding 2 siRNA (BSDP–2 siRNA/BSDP–1 siRNA > 2), whereas the BS is only
1.45 higher for DM binding 2 siRNA (BSDM–2 siRNA/BSDM–1 siRNA < 1.5). This evidence is
again in agreement with a higher stoichiometry of DP in binding siRNA,
as suggested in the recent literature.22

Figure 2 (A)

with siRNA. DP can interact with 2 siRNAs in 78.6% of the frames,
instead DM may complex with 2 siRNA in the 35.7% of the frames. (B)
Dendrimer–siRNAs BS analysis computed for DM–1 siRNA
(green), DM–2 siRNA (orange), DP–1 siRNA (blue), DP–2
siRNA (red).

To complete the picture, terminal-siRNA
distance analysis has been
performed in order to extract fruitful information on the interaction
behavior of the different DM and DP characterizing beads. In greater
detail, Table 2 shows
the number of Q0, N0, and C1 dendrimer
terminal beads present within three main distance intervals from the
siRNAs: “primary interaction (d ≤ 0.6
nm)” indicates a strong stabilization range where terminal
beads are primary involved in the dendrimer–siRNA complexation.
The “Secondary interaction (0.6 nm < d ≤
1.1 nm)” range indicates an interval where the terminal beads
are still involved in interaction with siRNA by van der Waals and
Coulomb forces. “Free terminals (d > 1.1
nm)”
indicate that no interaction is occurring between beads and siRNA
beyond this range. Remarkably, in both cases, where 1 or 2 siRNA are
complexed, DM involves a higher number of Q0 and N0 terminal beads for complexation purposes, whereas DP utilizes
a lower number of Q0 and C1 terminal beads.
Interestingly, the N0 bead of the DM terminals is employed
for primary stabilization tasks in a better way (DM–1 siRNA
N0/Q0 = 0.73, DM–2 siRNA N0/Q0 = 0.72), rather than the C1 bead of the
DP terminals (DP–1 siRNA C1/Q0 = 0.54,
DP–2 siRNA C1/Q0 = 0.47).

Main Ranges from siRNAs

T3. Dendrimer Competition Mechanisms
In this section,
we have investigated possible competition phenomena which may affect
the ability of DM and DP to complex in dendriplex assemblies (set
up described in section Methods, category
T3). To address this point, 15 replicas of 500 ns were carried out
for each system, considering the last 50 ns for all the following
analyses.

Figure 3A depicts the probability of the DP and DM dendrimers to be found
in dendriplex or free in solution. Interestingly, DP dendrimers are
found free in solution only with probability 0.2 among all replicas,
whereas DM can be found free in solution with a higher probability
up to 0.4. This implies that siRNA–DM complexes are in general
constituted by 1 siRNA and 1 dendrimer.

Figure 3 Picture (A) shows the
DM and DP aggregation percentage bar diagram
with siRNA and the percentage of 1 DM and DP free in solution. DP
dendrimers are found free in solution only with probability 20% among
all replicas, whereas DM can be found free in solution with a higher
probability up to 40%. Picture (B) shows the bending angle “θ”
bar diagram of 1DEN–siRNA, 2DEN–siRNA e siRNA alone.
Pictures (C,D) show, respectively, 2DMs and 2DPs in close complexation
with 1 siRNA.

It is worth noting that the higher
probability to find DP dendrimers
aggregated in dendriplexes is also driven by DP self-aggregation properties
(already highlighted by in vitro experiments22 and shown in Figure 1). This unique DP property is crucial for promoting dendriplex stabilization
and growth also through dendrimer–dendrimer contacts. In this
sense, the DP self-aggregation tendency should be interpreted as a
complexation promoting feature and not a competition mechanism. To
complete the picture, a contact analysis has been performed in order
to evaluate if the first contact occurs between the two dendrimers
or between the siRNA and the dendrimers. The distance below which
the molecules are considered as stably complexed is 0.6 nm. In detail,
aggregation occurs first between the two dendrimers in 2 replicas
out of total 15 (15.4%) for 2DP–siRNA systems, whereas it occurs
in 1 replica out of total 15 (7.2%) for two DM–siRNA systems.

It is worth mentioning that DM–siRNA complexation is stabilized
by a siRNA deformation while wrapping around dendrimer, as also shown
by AA simulation of the previous literature.22 The abovementioned DM–siRNA complexation feature is also
detectable in present CG simulations (Figure 3, Supporting Information S.6). Figure 3B quantifies the siRNA bending angle “θ” in three
cases: 1DEN–siRNA dendriplex, 2DEN–siRNA dendriplex
and siRNA alone. Interestingly, the results show that the siRNA bending
angle, both when it interacts with one and two DPs, is close to the
conformation assumed by siRNA when alone in water. In contrary, siRNA
structure deformation reached lower bending angles both in the case
of complexing with one and two DMs. However, siRNA is able to wrap
around only one between the two bound DM (Figure 3C, Supporting Information S.6). This aspect suggests that only one DM will be stabilized
in the complexation, whereas the other will be more likely able to
detach. In this sense, we highlight a competition mechanism in DM–siRNA
complexation, which is not present in DP–siRNA complexation
(Figure 3D, Supporting Information S.6). All these evidences
suggest some competition phenomena among dendrimers when an excess
of dendrimers are present in the solutions, as usual in experimental
studies. In detail, considering that the dendrimer–siRNA molar
ratio is always higher than 1,22 the competition
mechanisms can alter certain chemical parameters, including the stoichiometric
coefficients.

Discussion
Dendrimers are polymeric
hyperbranched nanocarriers characterized
by the globular shape with high monodispersity and high degree of
versatility, which have outstanding features for nanomedicine.34−44 Within this context, polycationic dendrimers have proven to be an
excellent drug delivery carrier for gene therapy strategies.45,46 In this paper, we have employed CG MD to investigate complexation
dynamics of siRNA with two different type of polycationic phosphorous
dendrimers, namely, the pyrrolidinium and morpholinium dendrimers.
MD has already shown to be a powerful tool to investigate nanoscale
phenomena driving macromolecules properties from the molecular to
supramolecular scale.44,47−51 Here, our in silico study aims at exploring molecular
features driving supramolecular complexation in terms of assemble
mechanisms and competition phenomena. In this framework, dendrimers
or dendrons self-assembled supramolecular nanostructures reduce the
difficulty in overcoming the plasmatic membrane, resulting in an increased
cellular uptake of siRNAs.52−54 Particular importance must be
given to the dendriplex size.6,17 More precisely, the
size of dendriplex plays a key role in avoiding problems such as little
effectiveness or excessive toxicity on the transfected cells.55 In this study, we have selected two different
cationic phosphorus dendrimers of generation 3, functionalized, respectively,
with pyrrolidinium (DP) and morpholinium (DM) surface groups, which
demonstrated a promising potential for siRNA delivery.6 Our data have demonstrated that DP has an increased capacity
to self-assembly rather than DM. Such behavior is related with the
different dendrimers’ chemical nature of the terminal beads,
which for DM is polar and for DP is completely apolar. Because systems
are immersed in an aqueous solvent, the behavior of nonpolar particles
to aggregate is increased, and probably it results in our demonstrated
tighter self-assembly showed by DP. Further studies on the size and
the polydispersity index of the DP aggregates could be indicated to
improve the control and the prediction of this sensitive characteristic,
with the aim of avoiding adverse events. Another important feature
to investigate in order to modulate the dendriplex size and conformation
is the dendrimer complexation behavior with siRNA molecules.56 In this context, cationic dendrimer–siRNA
aggregates formation are mainly driven by electrostatic interactions.57 Therefore, tuning up the peripheral positive
charge density and the terminal chemical structure of dendrimers may
strongly influence the binding attitude with siRNAs.58 Recent study has highlighted how even small difference
in dendrimer chemical composition can affect the enthalpy and entropic
contribution of DP and DM, drastically changing their stoichiometric
values.22 It has been already highlighted
how the dendrimer multivalence behavior is intrinsically connected
to the enthalpy contribution and the entropic penalty in the binding
free energy.59−61 In our research, we have demonstrated that DP has
an increased capacity to complex with 2 siRNAs, while DM has increased
attitude to complex with 1 siRNA. Such a different behavior may indicate
that DP can reorganize in a more efficient way its branches in order
to bind 2 siRNAs. On the other hand, DM may suffer from higher conformational
change when it complexes with 1 siRNA. This assumption is supported
by the BS analysis (Figure 2B), which confirms that DM has a greater interaction surface
both when it is complexed with 1 or 2 siRNAs. The higher BS values
exhibited by DM are due to its capability to flex the siRNA structure,
a behavior which is almost totally absent for the DP.22 Because DP has decreased the BS surface and employs a lower
number of terminals for complexation purposes, it has an increased
efficiency in binding siRNA rather than DM.6,22 In
addition, the lower number of terminals employed by DP can be also
useful in detachment of siRNAs once inside the cell, which can lead
to an amplified bioactivity. On the other hand, we have shown that
DP presents self-assembly mechanisms even in the presence of siRNA
double-strained filaments. Considering that in vitro experiments are
executed with an excess of dendrimer buffer,6,22 we
can suggest that DP concentration within the dendriplex will be probably
higher in comparison of DM concentration within the dendriplex. According
to the recent literature, positively charged nanoparticles and aggregates
have much greater propensity to translocate through cell membranes
than negatively or neutral charged ones.62−64 In addition,
the superficial positive charged molecules have proved to be also
strongly correlated to cellular uptake and cytotoxicity.65−67 The higher presence of DPs into the dendriplex nanoparticles can
result in a higher capability of masking the siRNA negative charge,
leading in an increased cellular internalization. On the other hand,
tuning properly the dendrimer hydrophobic/hydrophilic affinity with
membranes68,69 can also aid the efficient translocation
of dendriplexes inside the cell.62 In this
framework, DP increased apolar character rather than DM, may also
play a crucial role in the cellular uptake process, because of the
increased hydrophobic affinity with the plasmatic membrane. Taken
all together, it is reasonable to assume that DP increased binding
multivalence and self-assembly attitude, with no significant competition
phenomena, lead to higher dendriplex stabilization and neutralization
which ultimately can improve the cell transfection.

Conclusions
In the present study, we adopted the MARTINI force-filed to shed
light on the different supramolecular behavior of two cationic phosphorous
dendrimers, namely, DM and DP, in complexing siRNA. We have shown
how small surface modification might lead in significant changing
on the dendrimer–siRNA complexation dynamics. The results indicate
that DP is significantly more efficient in binding 2 siRNAs, while
DM has increased attitude to complex with 1 siRNA. In this framework,
we also highlighted a competition mechanism in DM–siRNA interaction,
which is not present in DP–siRNA interaction. The outcome of
this research provides fruitful insight in order to deeply understand
the mechanisms driving the supramolecular dendriplex formation. In
conclusion, this multiscale computational work paves the way for a
future investigation of the dendriplex structures formed by the large-scale
interaction of dendrimers and nucleic acids.

Methods
Dendrimers
CG Models
Dendrimers CG models, in terms
of coordinates and topology, were generated starting from AA trajectories
of DM and DP by grouping AA coordinates and mapping them in CG beads
as made in several previous works.24−27,29,51

AA-MD set up and results concerning
conformational stability are reported in our previous work and summarized
in Supporting Information S.1. The AA simulations
of single dendrimer in water will be used here as reference for validation
of CG dendrimer models.

CG-AA maps for DM and DP dendrimers
are shown in Figure 4. More details about the AA
group division and bead identification is reported in Supporting Information S.2. Nonbonded parameters
assigned to each CG bead have been taken from the MARTINI forcefield.24 AA trajectories and AA-CG maps were used as
input for PyCGTOOL70 in order to generate
the dendrimer CG-bonded terms topology.71,72

Figure 4 DP (top picture)
and DM (bottom picture) maps applied to the AA
structure. Different bead polarity is highlighted with different color:
apolar beads are indicated in gray, nonpolar beads in blue, polar
beads in red, and charged beads in green.

Dendrimer CG Model Validation
As mentioned above, the
dendrimer CG models were validated by comparing the dendrimer AA and
CG dendrimer conformational dynamics. In a greater detail, AA-MD and
CG-MD simulations have been performed on the same molecular system
(dendrimer in water) for both DP and DM.

The tuning of bonded
parameters was done using the iterative modified Boltzmann inversion
(ImBI) technique (Supporting Information S.3), to derive potentials of the bonded terms in order to match the
topological parameters of reference atomistic models. Structural conformation
of both CG dendrimer models was evaluated in comparison with AA trajectories,
by measuring mean and standard deviation of the radius of gyration
and root mean square fluctuations.

The ImBI requires several
steps of CG dynamics and a topology refinement
on the basis of a comparison with system properties obtained at the
CG level and the same properties obtained by AA-MD (target trajectory).48 Concerning the CG level, each dendrimer (DP
and DM) was positioned in the center of a dodecahedron box filled
with normal water beads, using 0.21 nm as van der Waals distance,
and ions (Na+ and Cl–) at a physiological
concentration (0.15 M). To prevent unwanted CG water freezing, 20%
of normal P4 water beads were replaced with special-type BP4 antifreeze
water beads.24

Then, each simulation
step of the ImBI was performed as follows.
The system (dendrimer in water) was energy-minimized by 2000 steps
of the steepest descent energy minimization algorithm. A 100 ps position-restrained
MD was performed at 320 K using the v-rescale73 thermostat in the NVT ensemble. Then, a 5 ns position-restrained
MD was performed at 320 K and 1 atm using Berendsen barostat in the NPT ensemble.74 Finally, a 100
ns MD without position restraints was performed in the NPT ensemble coupling the system by the Parrinello–Rahman75 barostat and the v-rescale73 thermostat. Atom velocities were randomly initialized following
a Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution. Long-ranged electrostatic
interactions were calculated at every step with the reaction-field
method, using a relative dielectric constant value of 15, with a cut-off
of 1.1 nm.76 A cut-off of 1.1 nm was also
applied to Lennard–Jones interactions.76 The LINCS77 algorithm approach allowed
an integration time step of 10 fs.

Validation analysis was performed
taking into account the last
20 ns of production run, following two main strategies: (A) suit the
bonded parameters as similar as possible to the atomistic models and
(B) try to optimize the conformational features of the dendrimers
as close as possible to the atomistic simulations.70,78,79

The detailed validation procedure
that has been adopted can be
found in the Supporting Information S.4.

Generation of siRNA CG Model
The parametrization followed
to obtain the siRNA CG model is based on the MARTINI DNA force-field
extension80 adapted in order to achieve
a correct implementation of the RNA properties.78 The siRNA CG model was created with a soft elastic network
which has allowed the building of correct double-stranded siRNA’s
structure.78 In detail, the soft model
has been found in good agreement with the experimental persistence
length and helical parameters for dsRNA molecules.78 The maximum recommended time-step in order to maintain
the simulations stability is 10 fs.78

CG MD of Dendrimer–Dendrimer and Dendrimer–siRNA
Complexation
CG MD developed in this work can be divided
into three main categories (T1, T2, and T3). For each category, a
different molecular system has been considered.

T1. Investigation of Dendrimer
Self-Aggregation Mechanisms
Two homologues, for example,
2DM molecules (or 2DP molecules),
have been positioned at a minimum distance of 3 nm from each other
(Figure 5A). The simulation
test aims at investigating DP and DM self-aggregation tendency.

Figure 5 Representation

each dendrimer type; (A) two homologues dendrimers in water (T1),
(B) siRNA–dendrimer–siRNA in water (T2), (C) dendrimer–siRNA–dendrimer
in water (T3). Water and ions are not shown in the picture.

T2. Investigation of siRNA–Dendrimer
Binding Stoichiometry
A system consisting of 2 siRNA and
1 dendrimer (DM or DP) has been
built by positioning each molecule at a minimum distance of 2 nm from
each other. The simulation test aims at investigating molecular reasons
behind a different stoichiometry shown by DP and DM in binding siRNA
(Figure 5B).

T3.
Investigation of Dendrimer Competition Mechanisms in Binding
siRNA
A system consisting of 2 dendrimers and 1 siRNA has
been built by positioning each molecule at a minimum distance of 2
nm from each other. The simulation test aims at investigating if some
kind of competition mechanism may affect the dendrimer ability to
bind siRNA (Figure 5C).

All CG simulations have been carried out in CG modeled
explicit water and ions as described below. In all the cases, the
molecular system was positioned in the center of a dodecahedron box
with a minimum periodic images distance no smaller than 2.0 nm and
solvated with nonpolarizable water beads. After that Na–Cl
ions were added at a concentration of 0.15 M, such as human extracellular
ions concentration, forming systems with a total amount of about 45,000
interacting beads. MARTINI v_2.1-dna forcefield24 was adopted for CG simulations. To avoid freezing of the
solvent beads, 20% of normal water beads (P4) was replaced with heavy
water beads (BP4).24 Long-ranged electrostatic
interactions were calculated at every step choosing the reaction-field
method, using a relative dielectric constant value of 15, with a cut-off
of 1.1 nm.76 A cut-off of 1.1 nm was also
applied to vdW interactions.76

Each
system was energy-minimized by 2000 steps of steepest descent
energy minimization algorithm. A 100 ps position-restrained MD was
performed at 320 K using v-rescale73 thermostat
in the NVT ensemble. Then was performed a 5 ns position-restrained
MD at 320 K and 1 atm using Berendsen74 barostat in the NPT ensemble, giving the time to
equilibrate the system density. Atom velocities were randomly initialized
following a Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution. Finally, 10 MD
replicas for category T1 and 15 MD replicas for both T2 and T3 were
performed for 500 ns each, without position restrains, in the NPT ensemble using Parrinello–Rahman75 barostat. Each replica was characterized by different atom
velocities at the beginning of the MD simulation. All the performed
analyses were done considering the last 50 ns of each replica.

GROMACS 2018.381,82 package was used for all MD simulations.
The visual MD (VMD)83 package was used
for the visual inspection of the simulated systems and for systems
snapshot rendering.
