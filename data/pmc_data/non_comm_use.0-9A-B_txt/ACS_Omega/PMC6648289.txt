The
α4/6βδ-containing GABAA receptors
are involved in a number of brain diseases. Despite the
potential of a δ-selective imaging agent, no PET radioligand
is currently available for in vivo imaging. Here, we report the characterization
of DS2OMe (1) as a candidate radiotracer, 11C-labeling, and subsequent evaluation of [11C]DS2OMe in
a domestic pig as a PET radioligand for visualization of the δ-containing
GABAA receptors.

Introduction
γ-Aminobutyric
acid (GABA) is the main inhibitory neurotransmitter
in the central nervous system and exerts its major physiological effect
via interaction with ionotropic GABAA receptors (GABAARs). The GABAARs are assembled from a variety of
subunits (α1–6, β1–3, γ1–3, δ, ε, θ, π,
and ρ1–3) forming hetero- or homopentameric
complexes in various combinations.1,2 The subunit
composition of GABAARs appears to differ with subcellular
localization, which dictates the type of inhibition mediated.3 The majority of GABAARs has the general
stoichiometry of 2α, 2β, and 1γ subunits.4 However, in a subpopulation of receptors, the
δ-subunit replaces the γ-subunit. δ-subunit-containing
GABAARs, for example, α4βδ,
α6βδ, and α1β2δ, are primarily found in peri- or extrasynaptic locations
where they mediate tonic inhibition, distinct from the fast and transient
synaptic inhibition.5,6 Aberrant tonic inhibition mediated
by α4/6βδ-containing receptors has been
implicated under various pathophysiological conditions and related
to discrete brain regions,1 including stroke
(cortex),7 Angelman syndrome (cerebellum),8 sleep-related disorders (thalamus),9 and depression (hippocampus).10 Therefore, these receptors have received a great deal of
attention in the last decades as potential drug targets.11 Consequently, development of selective tool
compounds and diagnostics to further understand the pharmacology and
physiological roles of these receptors will prove therapeutically
important.

Among the orthosteric ligands reported, the functional
δ-preferring
orthosteric agonist THIP (gaboxadol) (Figure 1) has been pursued as a novel treatment for
insomnia, reaching phase III clinical development. Gaboxadol is at
present in phase III clinical trials for treatment of Angelman syndrome.12 The imidazopyridine DS2, a functionally selective
α4/6β3δ positive
allosteric modulator (PAM), relative to its action at α4β3γ2 and α1β3γ2 receptors, has been reported.13,14 However, poor brain penetration precludes the use of DS2 for in
vivo studies.15

Figure 1 Chemical structures of
GABA, the orthosteric agonist THIP/gaboxadol,
and the two PAMs, DS2 and DS2OMe (1).

Recently, we reported a structure–activity
study on the
δ-selective imidazopyridine DS2 (Figure 1) and the corresponding 6,8-dibromo analogue
DS1 and the direct modulatory effect on [3H]-ethynylbicycloorthobenzoate
([3H]-EBOB) binding to δ-containing GABAARs.16 EBOB is a potent noncompetitive
GABAAR antagonist that binds to the picrotoxinin-binding
site within the GABAAR ion channel. [3H]-EBOB
binding is sensitive to conformational changes in the chloride channel,
which can be mediated by increasing concentrations of GABA and/or
are affected by modulators in the presence or absence of GABA.17−20

Since the δ-containing GABAARs are potentially
involved in the pathogenesis and symptoms of several disorders in
the central nervous system, a positron emission tomography (PET) tracer
would be a valuable tool. Inspired by the structure–activity
study mentioned above, we herein report the identification, radiosynthesis,
and in vivo PET studies of a low micromolar potency, selective, and
brain-penetrant PAM of δ-containing GABAARs ([11C]DS2OMe, [11C]1), in pig, as a promising
lead candidate for imaging the δ-containing GABAARs.

Results and Discussion
Initially, a potential 11C-labelling site in the core
scaffold of DS2 was identified based on the reported structure–activity
study and the experience obtained on the chemistry involved.16 Since the p-hydroxy analogue 2 (see Scheme 1) appears as an attractive precursor amenable for radiolabeling via
conventional 11C-methylation, the [11C]-p-methoxy analogue of DS2 ([11C]1) was selected as the candidate radiotracer.

Scheme 1 Synthesis of [11C]1
To probe the applicability of [11C]1 as
a specific radiotracer for the δ-containing GABAARs, the selectivity profiles of 1 and DS2 as PAMs were
compared using a fluorescence-based FLIPR membrane potential (FMP)
assay, based on the transient expression of human α1/4/6 and β2 subunits in a HEK293 Flp-In cell line, stably
expressing the human δ-subunit,21 or γ2 instead of δ for comparison. To this
end, the concentration of GABA corresponding to GABA EC20 was first determined from the full concentration–response
curves of GABA for each of the tested receptors (Table 1). Then, 1 and
DS2 were tested as PAMs in the presence of the determined EC20 GABA concentration. To investigate the importance of the α-subunit
for PAM activity, the subtypes, α1β2δ, α4β2δ, and α6β2δ, were compared. Full concentration–response
curves showed that 1 and DS2 displayed near equipotent
PAM activities (1–4 μM) at the different α-subunit-containing
receptors (Table 1, Figure 2). In parallel, to
confirm δ-subunit selectivity, 1 was also tested
as a PAM at α6β2γ2s. As shown, neither DS2 nor 1 had any effect at this
non-δ-containing receptor subtype when tested at concentrations
up to 10 μM (Table 1, Figure 2).
These data summarizes 1 as a novel δ-selective
DS2-analogue with low micromolar PAM activity. The cell line stably
expressing the δ-subunit has previously been used to study DS2
at α4β1δ versus binary α4β1/3 receptors using both the FMP assay and
whole-cell patch-clamp recordings, confirming that DS2 is δ-selective.16

of GABA
EC20 by 1 at α6β2δ and α6β2γ2s receptors and DS2 at α6β2δ receptors, tested in the FMP assay. Data are shown as mean
reSD of a single representative experiment performed with three technical
triplicates. Two additional experiments gave similar results; data
are summarized in Table 1.

The selectivity was further explored in The National Institute
of Mental Health’s Psychoactive Drug Screening Program (NIMH-PDSP)
(Supporting Information Table S1), where
binding affinity and cross selectivity of 1 to a large
panel of brain targets was assessed. 1 did not show significant
affinity (Ki > 10 μM) for other
tested biogenic receptors and transporters (45 in total).

The
high selectivity for δ-containing GABAARs
establish 1 as an interesting compound, as a PET radiotracer
candidate, for further studying the δ-containing GABAARs. Furthermore, since O-demethylation in general
is a major metabolic pathway, the O-demethylated
compound may be the major metabolite for 1. Therefore,
radiolabeling of the methoxy group, resulting in [11C]1 via radiomethylation of the hydroxyl analogue (2), was rendered the most suitable strategy to avoid/limit radioactive
metabolite formation.

Consequently, radiosynthesis of 1 was probed to obtain
the corresponding [11C]1. To obtain the hydroxylated
precursor, 2, a three-step procedure was applied, as
previously reported,16 using 2-aminopyridine,
thiophen-2-carbaldehyde, and potassium cyanide in a multicomponent
reaction, followed by amide-bond formation using 4-acetoxybenzoyl
chloride. The removal of the acetoxy group was accomplished with 5
M NaOH in tetrahydrofuran at room temperature.

The nonradiolabeling
experiment was performed by using methyl triflate
and 2 M NaOH in acetone for 3 min at 80 °C to enable the introduction
of O-methyl into 2 affording the target
compound 1.

The radiosynthesis of [11C]DS2OMe ([11C]1) was performed in a fully
automated system. [11C]CH3OTf was dissolved
in acetone containing the precursor
and base and reacted for 5 min at 60 °C. Isolation of the final
radiotracer, see Scheme 1, could be achieved via semipreparative high-performanec liquid chromatography
(HPLC) with a total synthesis time of 37 min (Supporting Information Figures S1 and S2).

The radiolabeled
compound [11C]1 was produced
with a good radiochemical yield of 19.9 ± 1.2% (n = 3, decay corrected), sufficient chemical and radiochemical purity
of >95%, and very high molar activities of 188–215 GBq/μmol.

Using the radiochemistry described and delineated in Scheme 1, [11C]1 was prepared for evaluation in in vivo PET imaging studies in a
domestic pig using a high-resolution research tomography (HRRT) PET
scanner. As an experimental animal, the pig allows us to acquire the
arterial input function necessary for kinetic modelling of the data.
The pig also has a larger and gyrenchephalic brain giving it a higher
translational value compared to, for example, rats. [11C]1 successfully entered the pig brain, with the radioligand
uptake being fairly uniform across different brain regions (Figure 3A). From the time–activity
curves, it is also evident that [11C]1 has
fast tracer kinetics in the four different regions measured, meaning
that the retention of the tracer in the brain is limited (Figure 3B). Two other baseline
PET experiments were conducted in two other pigs, showing a similar
uniform uptake and fast tracer kinetics (data not shown).

coronal planes (left to right). (B) Time–activity curves of

and after administration of 2.1 mg/kg unlabeled 1 (coadministrated

In one pig, we performed first the baseline scan
and subsequently
a self-block experiment, where we coinjected 2.1 mg/kg nonlabeled 1 along with [11C]1 (Figure 3C). Kinetic modelling of the
baseline and self-block PET data confirmed that the binding of [11C]1 is quite uniform across the brain. The total
distribution volume (VT) in the baseline
situation was the highest in the cortex (5.6 mL/cm3), followed
by the striatum (4.5 mL/cm3), thalamus (3.8 mL/cm3), hippocampus (3.8 mL/cm3), and last cerebellum (3.4
mL/cm3). This is not in accordance with the reported distribution
of α4/6δ containing GABAARs. After
administration of unlabeled 1, VTs was decreased in all regions: VT decreased by ∼40% in the hippocampus and cortex, whereas VT decreased by ∼18% in the thalamus and
cerebellum (Supporting Information Figure
S3A) indicating that there is some specific binding of [11C]1.

Radiometabolite analysis of plasma samples
from the pig revealed
that the metabolism of [11C]1 was fast with
only 50% of the parent compound remaining after ∼5 min. If
the metabolism of 1 is similarly fast in pharmacological
doses, it would render this compound unsuited as a clinical drug.
It is possible that the fast metabolism of [11C]1 is the reason for the observed fast tracer kinetics. After self-blockade,
the radiometabolism of [11C]1 was similar
to the baseline situation (Supporting Information Figure S3B). Only early eluting radiometabolites were detected with
our radio-HPLC method, suggesting that these metabolites were of a
polar nature (Supporting Information Figure
S4). The free fraction of [11C]1 in pig plasma
was measured to 15% using a dialysis chamber method with an incubation
time of 3 h. This is comparable to other radiotracers evaluated in
pigs.22,23

In conclusion, we here show a high
uptake of [11C]1 into the pig brain but the
uptake is uniform and clears
quickly. However, when the uptake was quantified, we found decreases
in binding after self-blockade, indicating some specific binding.
In contrast to DS2,13 [11C]1 enters the brain, which, together with its selectivity for
δ-containing GABAARs, renders 1 a promising
lead in developing a radiotracer for the target.

Experimental Section
Radiosynthesis
of [11C]DS2OMe ([11C]1)
[11C]methyl trifluoromethanesulfonate
([11C]MeOTf) was produced in an automated system and trapped
in 300 μL of acetone solution containing the precursor 4-hydroxy-N-(2-(thiophen-2-yl)imidazo[1,2-a]pyridin-3-yl)benzamide
(2, 0.1 mg, 0.3 μmol) and 5 μL 2 N NaOH at
room temperature. The reaction mixture was heated for 5 min at 60
°C before it was diluted in 4.3 mL 0.1% phosphoric acid and isolated
using semipreparative HPLC [C18 Onyx Semiprep monolithic column (Phenomenex
Inc. 100 × 10 mm), 70:30 100 mM phosphate-buffer/EtOH, at a flow
rate of 6 mL/min]. Retention times were 400 s for [11C]1 and 200–225 s for 2 (see Supporting Information Figure S1). The labeled
product was collected into a sterile 20 mL vial containing phosphate-buffer
(9 mL, 100 mM, pH 7). The final product was analyzed by analytical
HPLC [Luna, 5μ, C-18(2) 100 Å column (Phenomenex Inc. 150
4.6 mm); 60:40 0.01 M sodium borate buffer/acetonitrile; 1.5 mL/min].
Retention time for 1 was 4.48 min (see Supporting Information Figure S2). The overall synthesis,
purification, and formulation time was approximately 40 min. The product
[11C]1 could be produced and isolated with
sufficient molar activities (188–215 GBq/μmol (n = 2)) and radiochemical purities above 95%.

FMP Blue Assay
on GABAA Receptors Expressed in HEK-293
Cells
The FMP assay was performed on HEK-293 Flp-In cells
expressing human recombinant GABAA receptors using conditions
for cell-culturing and transfection as described previously.21 In brief, the cells were plated for transfection
24 h later with GABAA receptor plasmids with the Polyfect
Transfection Reagent (Qiagen, West Sussex, UK). For expression of
the δ-containing GABAA receptor subtypes, α1β2δ, α4β2δ, and α6β2δ,
HEK-293 Flp-In cells stably expressing the GABAA δ-subunit
were transfected by a 1:1 ratio of either α1, α4 (both pUNIV) (Addgene, Cambridge, MA, USA),24 or α6 (pcDNA3.1zeo) and β2 (pcDNA3.1zeo).25 α6β2γ2s receptors were transiently expressed
in background HEK-293 Flp-In cells21 using
a 1:1:2 ratio of α6-, β2- and γ2s-subunits, respectively.

Transfected cells 16–24
h post-transfection were plated into poly-d-lysine coated
black clear bottom 96-well plates (BD Biosciences, Bedford, MA, USA)
at a density of 50 000 cells/well and incubated for 16–20
h. On the day of the assay, the medium was aspirated, and the cells
were washed in 100 μL/well assay buffer [HBSS (Life technologies,
Paisley, UK) + 20 mM HEPES pH 7.4] followed by addition of 100 μL/well
of the FMP blue dye (0.5 mg/mL) (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA,
USA) and incubated in the dark for 30 min in a CO2 incubator
at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Ligand solutions were prepared
in 5× in assay buffer, which for testing of the PAMs contained
a concentration of GABA corresponding to GABA EC20. The
GABA EC20 concentrations were determined from full GABA
concentration–response curves for each subtype, as described
in the Results and Discussion section. Before
reading of the plate, the ligand solutions were added to 96-well ligand
plates and incubated for 15 min at 37 °C in the NOVOstar plate
reader (BMG, LABTECH GmbH, Offenburg, Germany). Fluorescence was determined
by excitation of the dye at 530 nm and emission at 560 nm. The relative
changes in the fluorescent signal (ΔFU) were analyzed by subtracting
the baseline signal from the maximum peak/plateau signal induced by
the ligands. Fluorescence signals were visually inspected, and any
artefacts were manually omitted from the analysis. Concentration–response
curves were fitted to obtain EC50 values using the four-parameter
concentration–response curve using GraphPad Prism 7.0 (GraphPad
Software Inc., San Diego, CA, USA)  with bottom and top being
the lower (e.g., the GABA EC20 level) and upper plateau
responses, respectively. [A] corresponds to the logarithmic concentration
of the ligand and nH to the hill slope
of the curve. The obtained EC50 values are based on at
least three independent experiments with each data point performed
with technical triplicates.

Animal Procedures, Pigs
One female
domestic pig (crossbreed
of Landrace × Yorkshire × Duroc, 22 kg) was used for in
vivo PET imaging. All animal procedures were approved by the Danish
Council for Animal Ethics (journal no. 2012-15-2934-00156). [11C]1 was given as intravenous (iv) bolus, and
the injected dose was 509 MBq in the baseline scan and 488 MBq in
the self-block scan. Molar activity at the time of injection was 129
and 113 GBq/μmol resulting in an injected mass of 1.37 and 1.51
μg. The pig was scanned twice for 90 min in the list mode. For
the second (self-block) scan, [11C]1 was coinjected
with 2.14 mg/kg unlabelled 1. 1 was dissolved
in 10% beta-cyclodextrin solution (Sigma-Aldrich).

The animal
was housed under standard conditions and was allowed to acclimatize
for 1 week. Before scanning, anaesthesia was induced with im injection
of 0.13 mL/kg Zoletil veterinary mixture (10.87 mg/kg xylazine + 10.87
mg/kg ketamine + 1.74 mg/kg methadone + 1.74 mg/kg butorphanol + 10.87
mg/kg tiletamine + 10.87 mg/kg zolezepam). Thereafter, anaesthesia
was maintained with constant propofol infusion [1.5 mg/kg/h intravenous
(iv); B. Braun, Melsungen, Germany]. Arterial iv access for drawing
blood was granted in the right femoral artery via a minor incision,
and two venous iv lines for injections were granted in the left and
right mammary veins. Analgesia was assured by iv injection of fentanyl
during surgery. During anaesthesia, animals were endotracheally intubated
and ventilated. Vital parameters (heart rate, body temperature, blood
pressure, blood glucose, oxygen saturation, and end tidal CO2) were continuously monitored during the scan.

Blood Sampling
During the first 30 min of the scans,
radioactivity in the whole blood was continuously measured using an
ABSS autosampler (Allogg Technology, Mariefred, Sweden) counting coincidences
in a lead-shielded detector. Concurrently, arterial whole blood was
sampled manually at times 2.5, 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 70, and 90 min
after injection of [11C]1. Total radioactivity
in plasma (500 μL) and whole blood (500 μL) was measured
in a well counter (Cobra 5003; Packard Instruments, Meriden, CT, USA),
which was cross-calibrated to the HRRT scanner and autosampler. All
measurements of radioactivity were decay-corrected to the time of
radioligand injection.

The free fraction of [11C]1 in pig plasma was measured using an equilibrium dialysis
method as previously described26 and calculated
as the ratio between radioactivity in a buffer and plasma.

Metabolite
analysis
Radiolabelled parent compound and
metabolites were determined by direct injection of plasma into a radio-HPLC
system (Dionex Ultimate 3000; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Hvidovre,
Denmark) configured for column switching. Manually drawn arterial
whole blood samples were centrifuged (1500g, 7 min,
4 °C), and plasma was filtered through a syringe filter (Whatman
GD/X 13 mm or 25 mm, poly(vinylidene difluoride) membrane, 0.45 μm
pore size; Frisenette ApS, Knebel, Denmark) before the analysis by
HPLC as previously described.27

Reconstruction
and quantification of PET data
Ninety-minute
list-mode PET data were reconstructed in 38 dynamic frames (6 ×
10, 6 × 20, 4 × 30, 9 × 60, 2 × 180, 8 ×
300, and 3 × 600 s). Images consisted of 207 planes of 256 ×
256 voxels of 1.22 × 1.22 × 1.22 mm. A summed picture of
all counts in the 90 min scan was reconstructed for the pig and used
for coregistration to a multimodal pig brain atlas, as described by
Villadsen et all.28 The time–activity
curves were calculated for the following volumes of interest (VOIs):
cortex, hippocampus, thalamus, striatum, and cerebellum (excluding
the vermis). Outcome measure in the time–activity curves was
calculated as the radioactive concentration in the VOI (in kBq/mL)
normalized to the injected dose corrected for animal weight (in kBq/kg),
yielding standardized uptake values (g/mL). Quantification of the
binding was performed in PMOD (version 3.0) with the Logan graphical
analysis, using the metabolite-corrected arterial plasma concentration
to calculate the total distribution volume (VT).
