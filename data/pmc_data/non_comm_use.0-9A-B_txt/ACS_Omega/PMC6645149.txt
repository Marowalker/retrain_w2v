The possible mechanisms
of 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene (DBU)-catalyzed chemoselective
insertion of N-methyl isatin into aryl difluoronitromethyl
ketone to synthesize 3,3-disubstituted and 2,2-disubstituted oxindoles
have been studied in this work. As revealed by calculated results,
the reaction occurs via two competing paths, including α and
β carbonyl paths, and each path contains five steps, that is,
nucleophilic addition of DBU to ketone, C–C bond cleavage affording
difluoromethylnitrate anion and phenylcarbonyl–DBU cation,
nucleophilic addition of difluoromethylnitrate anion to carbonyl carbon
of N-methyl isatin, acyl transfer process, and dissociation
of DBU and product. The computational results suggest that nucleophilic
additions on different carbonyl carbons of N-methyl
isatin via α and β carbonyl paths would lead to different
products in the third step, and β carbonyl path associated with
the main product 3,3-disubstituted oxindole is more energetically
favorable, which is consistent with the experimental observations.
Noteworthy, electrophilic Parr function can be successfully applied
for exactly predicting the activity of reaction site and reasonably
explaining the chemoselectivity. In addition, the distortion/interaction
and noncovalent interaction analyses show that much more hydrogen
bond interactions should be responsible for the lower energy of the
transition state associated with β carbonyl path. The obtained
insights would be valuable for the rational design of efficient organocatalysts
for this kind of reactions with high selectivities.

1 Introduction
In
the past decade, the development of synthetic methodologies
for multiple fluorinated nitroalkanes, which have the advantages of
general availability, high synthetic versatility, and a wide range
of applications in pharmaceutical and agrochemical fields, has received
widespread attention.1−11 Bissell first prepared difluoronitromethane, which was carefully
isolated at very low temperature by thermal decomposition of difluoronitroacetamidine.12 After that, there are a few reports on the C–C
bond formation with difluoronitromethane.13−15 Until 2016,
Wolf and coauthors, who had their longstanding interest in aldol reactions
with nitroalkanes16−19 and fluorinated enolates,8,20,21 reported a new synthetic methodology to prepare dihalonitronates
from aryl dihalonitromethyl ketones catalyzed by LiBr/N(i-Pr)2Et (depicted in Scheme 1A).22 Although
they contributed many efforts to explore the reaction mechanism by
using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and NMR analyses, the
detailed mechanism of the Lewis acid LiBr/N(i-Pr)2Et-catalyzed insertion reaction and the role of catalyst have
still been not very clear by now.

More recently,
Wolf et al. reported
a Lewis base 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene (DBU)-catalyzed insertion
of isatins into aryl difluoronitromethyl ketones to give difluoronitromethylated
oxindoles with high yields and 100% atom economy using chloroform
as solvent under mild conditions (depicted in Scheme 1B).23 Similarly,
this reaction might also follow on a C–C bond cleavage–aldol
reaction–acyl transfer sequence. As depicted in Scheme 1B, some efforts had been made
by Wolf’s group to speculate the possible catalytic mechanism,
and the experimental explorations of this kind of novel insertion
reactions are quite useful and constructive, but there are still some
key issues that need to be solved: (1) Why does the catalyst DBU nucleophilically
attack the carbonyl carbon of aryl difluoronitromethyl ketone (R1) rather than those of isatin (R2)? (2) How
does the catalyst promote the breaking of C–C bond in ketone
(R1)? (3) What is the role of DBU catalyst? (4) Why is
the main product P rather than Side-P depicted
in Scheme 1B? (5) What
are the key factors for controlling the chemoselectivity of this reaction?
To the best of our knowledge, no related theoretical investigation
on this kind of organocatalytic insertion of isatins into ketones
has been reported to date. The above questions and our interest in
organocatalysis24−33 have promoted us to pursue a density functional theory (DFT) study
on the title reaction. In this theoretical work, we not only investigated
the detailed mechanisms of the catalytic reaction, but also explored
the factors that govern the chemoselectivity of this kind of reaction.
Moreover, we would predict and validate which carbonyl carbon of reactants
would be the best electrophilic sites by using electrophilic and nucleophilic
Parr function analysis. We believe that this study will be useful
for understanding the organocatalytic insertion reactions, and it
provides valuable insights for recognizing the key role of catalyst
and origin of chemoselectivity.

In the present study, as illustrated
in Scheme 1B, the insertion
of N-methyl
isatin into aryl difluoronitromethyl ketone generating difluoronitromethylated
oxindole was selected as the reaction model to investigate the detailed
mechanism and the origin of chemoselectivity for this kind of reaction.
The reactants aryl difluoronitromethyl ketone and N-methyl isatin, the catalyst DBU, and the possible products 3-difluoronitromethyl-3-phenylcarboxyl-2-oxindole
and 2-difluoronitromethyl-2-phenylcarboxyl-2-oxindole were denoted
as R1, R2, Cat, P, and Side-P, respectively.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Reaction Mechanisms
As shown in Scheme 2, we suggested and
studied two possible competing reaction paths, including α and
β carbonyl paths, for the entire catalytic insertion of N-methyl isatin into aryl difluoronitromethyl ketone. It
can be seen that both these paths contain five steps. The first step
is the nucleophilic addition of Cat to R1, affording intermediate 2. The second step is C2–C4
bond cleavage of 2, forming intermediate 4, in which difluoromethylnitrate anion is dissociated with phenylcarbonyl–DBU
cation. Then, α carbonyl path diverges with β carbonyl
path in the following three steps, which is because of the existence
of two different reactive sites (carbonyl carbons) in R2. In the third step, nucleophilic additions on the different carbonyl
carbons of R2 by the difluoromethylnitrate anion afford
intermediates α-6 and β-6 via
α and β carbonyl paths, respectively. The fourth step
is the acyl transfer to the different carbonyl oxygen forming intermediates α-8 and β-8. The fifth step is the
regeneration of catalyst Cat, which is accompanied with
the dissociation of possible products P and Side-P. The associated energy profiles are shown in Figure 1, in which the Gibbs free energies (GFEs)
of R1 + R2 + Cat as 0.00 kcal/mol
were set as references and the geometries of Cat, R1, and R2 were optimized separately. Figure 2 depicts the optimized
structures of all of the stationary points in the reaction. The combined
energy profiles of the insertion reactions and the optimized geometries
can be found in Figure S1 of Supporting
Information.

the energies were calculated at the M06-2X-D3/6-311++G(2df, 2pd)/IEF-PCMchloroform//M06-2X/6-31G(d, p)/IEF-PCMchloroform level of theory.

the catalytic reaction (distance in angstrom, all of the hydrogens
were omitted for the sake of clarity). All of the geometries were
optimized at the M06-2X/6-31G(d, p)/IEF-PCMchloroform level.

Scheme 2 Possible Mechanisms for the Catalytic
Reaction
Actually, as shown
in Scheme 2, both reactants R1 and R2 have carbonyl groups, so which carbonyl
carbon is in the most favorable
position for nucleophilic attack by catalyst Cat remains
unclear. To solve this question, electrophilic and nucleophilic Parr
functions (Pk+ and Pk–)34 have been calculated and are summarized
in Table 1. The electrophilic
and nucleophilic Parr functions (Pk+ and Pk–, respectively) were obtained through the analysis
of the Mulliken atomic spin density of the radical anion and the radical
cation by single-point energy calculations over the optimized neutral
geometries for radical species at the M06-2X/6-31G(d, p)/IEF-PCMchloroform level. The computed results revealed that the nucleophilic
Parr functions (Pk–) of C2, C6, and C8 atoms are similar; however, the
value of the electrophilic Parr function (Pk+) of C2 atom in R1 (0.31)
is obviously higher than the corresponding values of C6 (0.10) and
C8 (0.22) atoms in R2, indicating that C2 atom of R1 has the strongest electrophilicity among the three carbonyl
carbons. So, we thought the reactant R1 would like to
act as the initial electrophile and was absorbed easily by the nucleophilic
catalyst Cat. That is to say, C8 atom should be nucleophilically
attacked more easily than C6 atom in R2. For validating
the prediction of local activities of reactants by using electrophilic
Parr functions, we have considered and investigated the possible and
competing pathways in a step-by-step fashion as follows.

Table 1 Electrophilic and Nucleophilic Parr
Functions (Pk+ and Pk–, Respectively) at the Atoms (C2, C6, and C8) in Reactants R1 and R2
 	R1	R2	
Parr function	C2	C6	C8	
Pk+	0.31a	0.10	0.22	
Pk–	–0.01	–0.07	–0.02	
a All of the electrophilic and nucleophilic
Parr functions (Pk+ and Pk–) were calculated at the M06-2X/6-31G(d, p)/IEF-PCMchloroform level of theory.

2.1.1 First Step: Nucleophilic Addition of Cat to R1
As depicted in Scheme 2, because both Cat and R1 do not have a chiral center, the nucleophilic
attack of Cat on re or si face of R1 can generate R or S configurational intermediates,
which should be a pair of enantiomers that have the same energy in
theory; thus, we only considered the attack of Cat on
one of the prochiral faces of R1. Similarly, we have
only considered a nucleophilic attack on one of the prochiral faces
of R2 by Cat. Initially, the reaction precursor 0 is formed by weak interactions between Cat and R1 and then the N1 atom in Cat can nucleophilically
attack C2 atom of R1 via transition state 1, generating intermediate 2. The energy barrier via 1 is 12.7 kcal/mol, and the relative Gibbs free energy of 2 is 12.4 kcal/mol, suggesting that this step is an endothermic
process and 2 is not very stable. Noteworthy, the dihedral
angle O2–C3–C4–N5 may change in the reaction
process, so four possible conformations have been investigated and
compared in the Supporting Information to
confirm that the lowest energy conformation was selected in the energy
profile.

As mentioned above, the N1 atom in Cat may also nucleophilically attack C6 and C8 atoms in R2, so we have tried but failed to locate both the corresponding intermediates
and transition states for the formations of N1–C6 and N1–C8
bonds.35 To explain the experimental equilibrium
between difluoronitroacetophenone and difluoronitroacetophenone–DBU
adduct (1.2:1), the ΔΔG between them
was calculated to be 0.1 kcal/mol, according to the Boltzmann distribution
equation. As shown in Figure 1, the energies of possible difluoronitroacetophenone–DBU
complexes (i.e., precursor 0 and intermediate 2) locate 3.5 and 12.4 kcal/mol above that of reactant, respectively.
The energy difference between the reactant and precursor 0 (3.5 kcal/mol), which is calculated to be 1.5 kcal/mol at the M06-2X/6-31G(d,
p)/IEF-PCMchloroform level and 3.5 kcal/mol at the M06-2X-D3/6-311++G(2df,
2pd)/IEF-PCMchloroform//M06-2X/6-31G(d, p)/IEF-PCMchloroform level, is close to the ΔΔG based on the experiment, so we think the calculated results should
be reasonable.

2.1.2 Second Step: C2–C4
Bond Cleavage
The second step is the C2–C4 bond cleavage,
in which 2 is dissociated into two parts, including difluoronitromethyl
anion and phenylcarbonyl–DBU cation. As presented in Scheme 2, the single bond
in 2 can be directly broken between C2 and C4 atoms via
transition state 3, affording intermediate 4. Furthermore, as shown in Scheme 2, we have considered another possible pathway, in which 2 can be structurally transformed to intermediate β-6 via an SN2 type of transition state β-3N2. As shown in Figure 1, the energy barrier via 3 (24.4
kcal/mol) is remarkably lower than that via β-3N2 (33.2 kcal/mol), indicating that the pathway
associated with β-3N2 can
be safely excluded.

2.1.3 Third Step: Nucleophilic
Addition of Difluoromethylnitrate
Anion to R2
The third step is the nucleophilic
addition of difluoromethylnitrate anion on carbonyl carbon of R2. As discussed above, there are two carbonyl carbons in R2 that can be nucleophilically attacked by nitro carbon of
difluoromethylnitrate anion, so the following reaction divides into
two possible α and β carbonyl paths. As shown in Scheme 2, because both participated
parts (i.e., difluoromethylnitrate anion and reactant R2) have no chiral center, obviously, the nucleophilic attack on the re and si face of C6=O7 and C8=O9
carbonyl groups of R2 by difluoromethylnitrate anion
would generate a pair of R and S configurational enantiomers with
the same energy in theory. Thus, we only need to consider the nucleophilic
attack on one of the prochiral faces of R2. During this
process, the intermediates α-6 and β-6 were obtained by the nucleophilic attack of C4 atom in difluoromethylnitrate
anion on C6 and C8 atoms in R2 via their corresponding
transition states α-7 and β-7, which results in chemoselectivity of the reaction.

In this
step, a single bond between C4 atom and C6/C8 atom is formed in α-6/β-6. As shown in Scheme 2, the C6=O7 double bond lengthens
to C6–O7 single bond in α-6, whereas the
C8=O9 double bond changes to C8–O9 single bond in β-6. Notably, the different chemoselectivities were
initiated in this step, meaning this process would be the key for
chemoselectivity of the reaction. As depicted in Figure 1, the energy barriers via α-5 and β-5 are 3.7 and 0.4 kcal/mol,
respectively, with respect to 4, and the relative Gibbs
free energies of α-6 and β-6 are 18.7 and 4.8 kcal/mol, respectively, indicating that β-6 is more stable than α-6 in thermodynamics. The
energy of β-5 is significantly lower (∼3.3
kcal/mol) than that of α-5, and the energy of β-6 is extremely lower (∼13.9 kcal/mol) than
that of α-6. Therefore, the β carbonyl path
is more energetically favorable than the α carbonyl path, which
is consistent with the prediction of electrophilic Parr function (Pk+) analysis results,
that is, C8 atom can be nucleophilically attacked more easily than
C6 atom in R2.

2.1.4 Fourth
Step: Acyl Transfer Process
The next reaction process is
the acyl transfer from the phenylcarbonyl–DBU
cation to the two different carbonyl oxygens (O7 and O9 atoms) for
the formation of zwitterion intermediates α-8 and β-8 via α and β carbonyl paths, respectively.
As shown in Scheme 2, a negative charge center is formed at O7 and O9 atoms in α-6 and β-6, respectively, which
facilitates the nucleophilic attack on C2 atom via transition states α-7 and β-7, affording intermediates α-8 and β-8, respectively. The natural
bond orbital (NBO) analysis has been conducted for the key atoms during
this process. As summarized in Table 2, both the charge values of O7 and O9 atoms are significantly
reduced in α-6/β-6, indicating
that the negative charge centers would be formed in this step. As
depicted in Figure 1, the energy barriers associated with α-7 and β-7 are 7.9 and 3.8 kcal/mol, corresponding to α-6 and β-6, respectively, and the
energies of α-8 and β-8 are
located 20.7 and 4.5 kcal/mol above those of reactants, respectively,
indicating that the β carbonyl path is more energetically favorable
than α carbonyl path during this step.

at the M06-2X-D3/6-311++G(2df, 2pd)/IEF-PCMchloroform//M06-2X/6-31G(d,
p)/IEF-PCMchloroform level.

2.1.5 Fifth Step: Regeneration
of Cat
As presented in Scheme 2, the last step of this reaction is the dissociation
of catalyst Cat and the possible products P/Side-P via transition states α-9/β-9, leading
to the regeneration of the catalyst. As calculated by single-point
energies, the energy barriers without any corrections associated with α-9 and β-9 are only 0.6 and 0.7
kcal/mol, respectively, indicating that the two processes can occur
smoothly under the experimental condition. As can be seen in Figure 1, the energy differences
between α-9/β-9 and α-8/β-8 are separately −1.2/–0.1 kcal/mol,
indicating that the two processes are barrierless. As concluded as
above, the β carbonyl path is more energetically preferred than
the α carbonyl path and the second step (via 3)
in the β carbonyl path has the highest energy barrier, indicating
that the C2–C4 bond cleavage is the rate-determining step.

2.2 Role of the Catalyst
The previous
theoretical work has provided evidence that Lewis base can not only
act as base but also work as nucleophile.28,31,32,36−38 To confirm the role of Lewis base DBU, we have performed global
reactivity index (GRI) analysis of the related reactants and intermediates. Table 3 provides the electrophilicity
index ω,39,40 electronic chemical potential
μ, chemical hardness η, energies of highest occupied molecular
orbital (HOMO) (EH) and lowest unoccupied
molecular orbital (LUMO) (EL), and nucleophilicity
index N.34,41−44 The nucleophilicity index N, which is based on
tetracyanoethylene (TCNE) taken as a reference, is defined as N = EHOMO(2) – EHOMO(TCNE). As summarized in Table 3, the electrophilicity of ketone R1 is dramatically decreased after the absorption of catalyst,
but its nucleophilicity is remarkably increased from 1.145 to 2.279
eV in 2 and finally to 3.328 eV in 4. Therefore,
the GRI analysis demonstrates that the DBU catalyst mainly works as
Lewis base to strengthen the nucleophilicity of R1, which
would further facilitate the nucleophilic attack on the carbonyl carbons
of R2 in the following processes.

at the M06-2X-D3/6-311++G(2df, 2pd)/IEF-PCMchloroform//M06-2X/6-31G(d,
p)/IEF-PCMchloroform level of theory.

To verify the fact that DBU shows
the highest catalytic efficiency
than the other Lewis bases for this insertion reaction in experiments,
we have computed the reactions catalyzed by other two Lewis bases
(e.g., 2,6-lutidine and 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP)) to investigate
and compare the relative energy barriers of the rate-determining step
(Table 4). As summarized
in Table 4, the energy
barrier via transition state 3DBU (24.4 kcal/mol) is obviously lower than that via transition states 32,6-lutidine (46.3 kcal/mol)
and 3DMAP (26.9 kcal/mol). The
extremely high energy barrier (46.3 kcal/mol) indicates that the insertion
reaction catalyzed by 2,6-lutidine is impossible, and the insertion
reaction catalyzed by DMAP can occur probably under mild condition
but with the lower efficiency relative to that catalyzed by DBU, which
is well consistent with the experimental observations.23 Furthermore, we have predicted the efficiency
of some new catalysts in theory, and the results are referenced in Supporting Information.

In addition, Wiberg bond order
analyses on N1–C2, C2–O3,
and C2–C4 bonds in R1 and 2 have
been performed on the basis of NBO analysis at the M06-2X/6-31G(d,
p)/IEF-PCMchloroform level using the software of Mutiwfn,45 and the computed data are provided in Table 5. As summarized in Table 5, the bond order of
C2–C4 slightly reduces from 0.95 in R1 to 0.92
in 2, whereas the bond length increases from 1.55 to
1.57 Å. The bond order of C2–O3 reduces significantly
from 2.63 in R1 to 2.22 in 2, whereas the
bond length increases from 1.21 to 1.28 Å, suggesting that both
C2–O3 and C2–C4 bonds weakened after the absorption
of the catalyst. As concluded as above, the DBU catalyst can not only
act as the nucleophile, but also weaken the bond order to promote
the C–C bond cleavage in the next process.

2.3 Origin
of Chemoselectivity
To disclose
the origin of chemoselectivity from a theoretical perspective is of
great value for experimental scientists to design the reactions with
high selectivities. In the competing α and β carbonyl
paths, nucleophilic center (C4 atom) of difluoromethylnitrate anion
attacks on one of the electrophilic sites (C6 or C8 atoms) of R2 in the third step; therefore, the stabilities of the relevant
transition states (α-5/β-5) would be important
for explaining chemoselectivity of the reaction. The distortion/interaction
analysis of α-5 and β-5 has
been carried out to value the preference of β-5. As summarized in Table 6, the distortion energy (ΔE‡dist) of β-5 (141.8 kcal/mol) is slightly
larger (1.7 kcal/mol) than that of α-5 (140.1 kcal/mol),
whereas the interaction energy (ΔE‡int) of β-5 (−121.1 kcal/mol)
is significantly lower (5.0 kcal/mol) than that of α-5 (−116.1 kcal/mol), indicating that the stronger interaction
would be responsible for the energy favorability of β-5.

For further understanding the preference of β-5, noncovalent interaction (NCI) analyses of α-5/β-5 were then performed to explore the effects
of their existing interactions,
including strong interactions, van der Waals interactions, and repulsive
steric interactions. As Figure 3 shows, β-5 has more hydrogen bond interactions
and less repulsive steric hindrances than α-5,
indicating that the hydrogen bond interactions play critical roles
in the determination of the chemoselectivity of this reaction. As
concerned as above, the NCI analysis would be a powerful tool for
exploring the origin of chemoselectivity and thus provide some valuable
insights for experimental chemists on rational design of this kind
of reactions with high selectivities.

3 Conclusions
In this
work, DFT calculations have been performed to investigate
the possible mechanisms and chemoselectivities of the synthesis of
functionalized difluoronitromethylated oxindole, utilizing the N-methyl isatin and aryl difluoronitromethyl ketone as substrates
catalyzed by DBU. Two possible paths, including α and β
carbonyl paths, were studied in detail. The computed results suggested
that the β carbonyl path is more energetically favorable than
the α carbonyl path and the C–C bond cleavage is the
rate-determining step, thereby leading to P as the main
product, which is in accord with the experimental observations. The
favorable path contains five steps, that is, nucleophilic addition
of Cat to the carbonyl carbon of R1, C–C
bond cleavage for the formation of difluoromethylnitrate anion and
phenylcarbonyl–DBU cation, nucleophilic addition of difluoromethylnitrate
anion to β carbonyl carbon of R2, acyl transfer
process, and the regeneration of Cat coupled with the
formation of product P.

The computational results
indicate that the third step is the key
for the chemoselectivity, and the distortion/interaction and NCI analyses
demonstrate that the chemoselectivity has been significantly affected
by the hydrogen bond interactions. Interestingly, the convenient calculations
of Parr function would be successfully used for predicting the chemoselectivity
of this kind of reactions, which gives a new clue for rational design
and pathway searches for the electrophilic and nucleophilic reactions.
This work would provide some valuable insights for theoretical and
experimental investigations into such kind of organocatalytic chemoselective
insertion reaction in future.

4 Computational Details
All of the theoretical calculations were carried out in the Gaussian
09 suite of programs.46 All of the stationary
points were optimized by DFT method, which has been proved to be a
powerful tool for clarifying the detailed reaction mechanisms in enzymes,47−51 transition metals,30,52−58 organocatalysts27−33,36,53,59−68 catalyzed reactions, and other theoretical studies.69−76 All of the species were optimized with M06-2X77−79 density functional
and 6-31G(d, p) basis set in chloroform solvent using the integral
equation formalism polarizable continuum model (IEF-PCM).80,81 Harmonic vibrational frequency calculations were performed at the
same level of theory as that used for geometry optimizations to provide
thermal corrections of Gibbs free energies and to make sure that the
local minima had no imaginary frequencies, whereas the saddle points
had only one imaginary frequency. Intrinsic reaction coordinates82,83 were calculated to confirm that the transition-state structure connected
the correct reactant and product. The single-point energies accompanied
with natural bond orbital (NBO) analyses of all of the species have
been computed at the M06-2X-D3/6-311++G(2df, 2pd)/IEF-PCMchloroform level. Noncovalent interaction (NCI) analysis was plotted using
Multiwfn (version 3.3.8).84 The optimized
structures were rendered using the CYLview software.85 The calculated results were discussed above on the basis
of the relative Gibbs free energies (GFE) attributed by the addition
of Gibbs free energy corrections at the M06-2X/6-31G(d, p)/IEF-PCMchloroform level to the single-point energies at the M06-2X-D386/6-311++G(2df, 2pd)/IEF-PCMchloroform level, which is denoted as the M06-2X-D3/6-311++G(2df, 2pd)/IEF-PCMchloroform//M06-2X/6-31G(d, p)/IEF-PCMchloroform level.

To test the accuracy of the selected method, we have
performed
additional calculations at the M06-2X/6-311++G(2df, 2pd)/IEF-PCMchloroform//M06-2X/6-31G(d, p)/IEF-PCMchloroform and ωB97X-D87/6-311++G(2df, 2pd)/IEF-PCMchloroform//ωB97X-D/6-31G(d, p)/IEF-PCMchloroform levels. The computed results indicate that there are small differences
in energy and structures obtained by using the different methods,
and more details can be found in the Supporting Information.

In the distortion/interaction analysis,88−91 the activation energy (ΔE‡act) of transition state
is attributed by two main components: distortion (ΔE‡dist) and interaction (ΔE‡int) energy. The distortion
energy composed of geometric and electronic changes is generally used
to value the deformation of reactants (DBU + R1 + R2) within transition-state geometry, and the interaction
energy contains repulsive and stabilizing electrostatic, polarization,
and orbital effects in the transition-state structure, which is recovered
by the relationship: ΔE‡int = ΔE‡act – ΔE‡dist.
