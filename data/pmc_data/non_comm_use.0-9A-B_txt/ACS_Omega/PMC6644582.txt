The
design and fabrication of inexpensive highly efficient electrocatalysts
for the production of hydrogen via the hydrogen evolution reaction
(HER) underpin a plethora of emerging clean energy technologies. Herein,
we report the fabrication of highly efficient electrocatalysts for
the HER based on magnetron-sputtered MoS2 onto a nanocarbon
support, termed MoS2/C. Magnetron sputtering time is explored
as a function of its physiochemical composition and HER performance;
increased sputtering times give rise to materials with differing compositions,
i.e., Mo4+ to Mo6+ and associated S anions (sulfide,
elemental, and sulfate), and improved HER outputs. An optimized sputtering
time of 45 min was used to fabricate the MoS2/C material.
This gave rise to an optimal HER performance with regard to its HER
onset potential, achievable current, and Tafel value, which were −0.44
(vs saturated calomel electrode (SCE)), −1.45 mV s–1, and 43 mV dec–1, respectively, which has the
highest composition of Mo4+ and sulfide (MoS2). Electrochemical testing toward the HER via drop casting MoS2/C upon screen-printed electrodes (SPEs) to electrically wire
the nanomaterial is found to be mass coverage dependent, where the
current density increases up to a critical mass (ca. 50 μg cm–2), after which a plateau is observed. To allow for
a translation of the bespoke fabricated MoS2/C from laboratory
to new industrial applications, MoS2/C was incorporated
into the bulk ink utilized in the fabrication of SPEs (denoted as
MoS2/C-SPE), thus allowing for improved electrical wiring
to the MoS2/C and resulting in the production of scalable
and reproducible electrocatalytic platforms. The MoS2/C-SPEs
displayed far greater HER catalysis with a 450 mV reduction in the
HER onset potential and a 1.70 mA cm–2 increase
in the achievable current density (recorded at −0.75 V (vs
SCE)), compared to a bare/unmodified graphitic SPE. The approach of
using magnetron sputtering to modify carbon with MoS2 facilitates
the production of mass-producible, stable, and effective electrode
materials for possible use in electrolyzers, which are cost competitive
to Pt and mitigate the need to use time-consuming and low-yield exfoliation
techniques typically used to fabricate pristine MoS2.

1 Introduction
The
current fossil fuel (FF)-based energy economy has resulted
in several detrimental issues, including poor air quality within heavily
urbanized areas and anthropogenic climate change. As a result of this,
research has focused on finding less polluting and more sustainable
alternative energy generation/storage methods.1 Although there are numerous possible alternatives, very few are
economically competitive with their FF counterparts. A promising candidate
that could become cost competitive with FF is hydrogen,2 produced via the hydrogen evolution reaction
(HER) (2H+ + 2e– → H2) in electrolyzers, which can then be used as a fuel source in fuel
cells. The requirement of expensive platinum (Pt) as an effective
electrocatalyst within electrolyzers is becoming nonessential as researchers
have shown that two-dimensional (2D) nanomaterials, such as MoS2 and MoSe2, for example, can offer comparable activity,
in regard to the HER onset potential and achievable current densities,
while being cheaper and more earth abundant.3−5 For example,
Voiry et al.6 showed that conductive 1-T
MoS2 nanosheets can display HER activity compared with
Pt-based electrodes. A recent study by Lazar and Otyepka7 has added compelling evidence to the theory that
MoS2 is anisotropic in regard to its electrochemical properties,
with the edge planes being the site of electron transfer and the basal
planes being considered comparatively inert due to their negligible
contribution to the heterogeneous electron transfer kinetics displayed
by the MoS2 monolayer. The edge plane is typically composed
of Mo and S atoms, both have unique electrocatalytic properties under
particular conditions.7−10 In the case of the HER in an acidic medium, it is the dangling bonds
of the electronegatively charged S atoms, located at the monolayers
edge sites, which have an affinity for binding electropositive H+ atoms. This affinity for H+ adsorption is due
to low binding energy (+0.08 eV), predicted by density functional
theory, at the edge plane sites.8,11,12

There are multiple fabrication techniques utilized within
the literature
for the production of two-dimensional dichalcogenides, such as MoS2 nanosheets, the most common fabrication techniques being
chemical vapor deposition,13 liquid exfoliation,14 mechanical exfoliation,15 electrochemical exfoliation, and shear exfoliation.16 One interesting approach is the use of magnetron sputtering,
which is a well-established technique for the deposition of thin films.
The use of magnetron sputtering enables precise control over the amount
and composition of the sputtered material, whereas variation of the
deposition parameters, such as power, pulse frequency, and deposition
pressure, allows control of the coating morphological and structural
properties.17 Magnetron sputtering is typically
used for deposition of thin films onto flat substrates, but recent
work described by Ratova et al.18,19 enables simple, yet
efficient deposition of sputtered coatings onto powders or particulates.
Related to the context of this work, Escalera-López et al.20 reported the fabrication of a Ni–MoS2 hybrid of nanoclusters supported upon a glassy carbon stub
using a dual-target magnetron sputtering technique and explored these
nanoclusters toward the HER. The Ni–MoS2 nanoclusters
were shown to display a 100 mV reduction in the HER onset potential
and a 3-fold increase in the exchange current density compared to
undoped MoS2 clusters.

In this paper, we report for
the first time, the fabrication of
novel and highly efficient electrocatalysts for the HER via magnetron
sputtering of MoS2 onto nanocarbon supports (MoS2/C). The composition of the MoS2/C is detailed as a function
of sputtering time (7.5–120 min), and its effect upon the HER
is evaluated. The optimal MoS2/C sputtering is evaluated
toward the HER and is explored as a function of coverage upon screen-printed
electrodes (SPEs). Additionally, MoS2/C is incorporated
into the bulk ink utilized in the fabrication of bespoke SPEs, allowing
for the mass production of reproducible electrocatalytic platforms
to be realized for the first time.

2 Results
and Discussion
The MoS2/C was fabricated, as described
in the Experimental Section, via magnetron
sputtering.
MoS2 was deposited onto the nanocarbon support for different
sputtering times over the range of 7.5–120 min. The resultant
bespoke material was explored electrochemically toward the HER within
an acidic media via drop casting a dispersal onto screen-printed electrodes
(SPEs) to electrochemically wire and study the MoS2/C. Figure 1 depicts typical
linear sweep voltammograms (LSVs) corresponding to the HER as a function
of different sputtering times, where it is readily evident that the
bare/unmodified SPE has a more electronegative onset potential (−0.84
V (vs saturated calomel electrode (SCE))) than any of the MoS2/C variants, which are closer to the optimal polycrystalline
platinum (Pt) electrode that exhibits an electrochemical signature
at −0.28 V. In regard to the MoS2/C electrochemical
activity, from 7.5 to 45 min of deposition, the HER onset overpotential
decreases in electronegativity from −0.80 to −0.44 V
(vs SCE). For deposition times greater than 45 min, there is a gradual
increase in the electronegativity of the overpotential for the HER
to −0.46 V (vs SCE) and −0.50 V (vs SCE) for the 60
and 120 min MoS2/C variants, respectively. It was also
important to consider which deposition time resulted in a MoS2/C variant, that once deposited onto a SPEs surface, resulted
in the greatest achievable current density. As presented in Table 1, the current density
follows a similar trend to the HER onset potential, with the current
density recorded at −0.75 V (vs SCE), increasing from −0.11
to −1.45 mA cm–2 as the deposition time increases
from 7.5 to 45 min, respectively. Again, with deposition times over
45 min, there was a decrease in HER activity as the 60 and 120 min
runs exhibited achievable current densities of −1.30 and −1.19
mA cm–2, respectively. With the clear increase in
the HER activity of the SPEs upon modification with MoS2/C variants, especially the 45 min variant, it is important to assess
whether there is an alteration in the HER mechanism between the bare/unmodified
SPE and the MoS2/C variants.

To explore the HER mechanism occurring at the MoS2/C-modified
SPEs, Tafel analysis was performed as this is a common approach within
the academic literature.5,21 There are three possible
steps in the HER reaction, each of which is capable of being the rate-determining
step. The initial H+ discharge step being the Volmer reaction,
which is followed by one of two possible discharge steps, either the
Heyrovsky or the Tafel step.22 An optimal
HER electrocatalyst, such as Pt, is expected to have a discharge step
as the rate-limiting step in the HER mechanism, which is typically
limited by the rate of the Tafel step. Tafel analysis was performed
on the Faradaic sections of the LSVs shown in Figure 1A with the resultant Tafel slopes and values
being exhibited in Figure S1 and Table 1, respectively. The
bare/unmodified SPE and Pt electrode were observed to have Tafel slope
values of 133 and 18 mV dec–1, respectively; thus,
it is likely that the rate-limiting steps in these cases are the Volmer
adsorption and Tafel discharge step, respectively. The 7.5 and 15
min MoS2/C variants both display Tafel slope values, which
indicate that they are rate limited by the Volmer step, whereas the
30, 45, 60, and 120 min MoS2/C variants have values indicating
that they are limited by the Heyrovsky step. These values imply that,
upon modification of an SPE with the 30, 45, 60, and 120 min MoS2/C variants, there is a reduction in the free energy barrier
of the discharge step and the HER reaction mechanism is beneficially
altered.23 It is clear from the above analysis
that utilizing a MoS2 deposition time of 45 min results
in the MoS2/C variant with the most beneficial HER activity,
with regard to it displaying the least electronegative onset potential,
highest current density, and smallest Tafel slope values of −0.44
V (vs SCE), −1.45 mA cm–2, and 43 mV dec–1. It is of note that these values are preferential
(greater HER activity) to those obtained when an equivalent mass coverage
of commercially available pristine 2D-MoS2 is deposited
onto a SPE (LSV’s not presented herein but data reported in Table 1). This is likely
due to a higher surface coverage of MoS2 on the nanocarbon
surface from the 45 min sputtering time, which is corroborated with
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis (see Table 2 and Figures S2 and S3). Thus, the above data indicate that the 45 min MoS2/C variant has the most abundant electrocatalytic sites upon
the surface of the MoS2/C, where the active edges (S atoms)
of the MoS2 are preferentially exposed and capable of binding
protons. The reduction in HER activity after 45 min likely represents
a critical deposition point, where additional deposition of MoS2 leads to blocking of the active edge sites by less-electrocatalytic
Mo- and S-containing compounds (Table 1).

Figure 1B demonstrates
how the immobilized mass/coverage of MoS2/C on an SPE affects
achievable current density (recorded at −0.75 V (vs SCE)).
There is a significant increase from −0.10 to −0.81
mA cm–2 in the achievable current density upon modification
of a bare SPE with ca. 7 μg cm–2. Following
this, there is then a gradual increase until at ca. 50 μg cm–2 where the current density is −1.71 mA cm–2. With additional masses/coverage, a plateauing is
observed where further increases in MoS2/C coverage do
not result in any significant increase in the achievable current density.
This obvious plateau likely arises when the coverage of MoS2/C is sufficient to result in an optimal ratio of edge-to-basal MoS2 sites after which further additions do not infer greater
HER catalysis due to reduction in the accessible triple phase boundary.
The plateauing may also arise due to delamination of MoS2/C from the SPEs surface, which has been observed in other systems/configurations.24

A thorough physicochemical characterization
of the fabricated MoS2/C was performed to evaluate the
observed alterations in HER
activity as a function of magnetron sputtering time, i.e., nanoparticle
coverage. Figure S4 shows SEM images of
the 7.5, 15, 30, 45, 60, and 120 min magnetron sputter-coated MoS2/C. TEM was performed on the optimized (see electrochemical
characterization) 45 min MoS2/C sample with TEM images
depicted in Figure 1C,D. Note that Fourier transforms for the 45 min MoS2/C
variant can be observed in Figure S5. It
is clear that the individual particles are in the range of 50 nm,
which agrees with the manufacturer’s quoted size range for
uncoated nanocarbon of 40–45 nm with magnetron sputtering coating
the outside of the nanocarbons, resulting in a final size of 50 nm
for the MoS2/C; interestingly, it can be visually observed
that there is a layered nanomaterial around the circumference of the
45 min MoS2/C particles (see Figure 1D). The layers around the circumference of
the carbon particles have an interlayer distance of ca. 0.5 nm, which
corresponds with the expected value for MoS2 nanosheets.25

Raman spectroscopy was also performed
on the MoS2/C
variants (spectra shown in Figure S6),
where the expected peaks at ca. 380 and 405 cm–1, which correspond to the E12g and A1g, of MoS2, respectively, are unexpectedly absent.26 Raman peaks are observed at ca. 1350 and 1580
cm–1, which are characteristic of a graphite-based
material.27,28 Additionally, X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis
was conducted but the characteristic diffraction peak for MoS2 at 14.2° was not observed;29 the XRD spectra for each MoS2/C variant is presented
in Figure S7. EDX was additionally performed
with the average (N = 5) percentage of carbon, molybdenum,
and sulfur being shown in Table S1 (see Figure 1D for an example
of an EDX analysis spot). As the deposition time for the MoS2 increases from 7.5 to 120 min, there is a corresponding increase
in the total molybdenum and sulfur concentration from ca. 0.3 to 1.71%.
The atomic ratio of molybdenum to sulfur at every deposition time
is expected to be ca. 1:2, which strongly indicates that the magnetron
sputtering technique utilized herein is in fact depositing MoS2.30 Note that while the physiochemical
characterization (Raman and XRD) fails to clearly identify the MoS2, it is clearly present as evidenced by the EDX and electrochemical
analysis, noting that the latter is a very sensitive interfacial technique.
Finally, XPS was performed on the MoS2/C variants. In all
cases, only C, O, Mo, and S were detected with a typical survey spectrum
shown in Figures S1 and S2 for the 45 min
sputtered sample. In addition to the strong C 1s, O 1s, Mo 3d, and
S 2p lines, the spectrum also shows the Mo 3p doublet at ca. 394 and
412 eV, the Mo 3s peak at ca. 506 eV, the X-ray-excited O KVV Auger
peak at ca. 990 eV, and weaker structures at low binding energy attributable
to Mo 4s and 4p peaks, along with weak O 2s and C 2s/2p contributions.
The high-resolution spectra for the Mo and S areas of the MoS2/C 45 min sample is presented in Figure S3 and used as a representative example for the other deposition
times. For a thorough description of the Mo and S spectra, interested
readers are directed to the Supporting Information. The chemical state and elemental composition, expressed in a percentage,
are determined and presented in Table 2.

It is not possible to determine the exact amounts
of MoS2, MoO3, MoSO4, and other Mo/S
molecules on
the surface of the MoS2/C samples. However, balancing the
oxygen and sulfur concentrations with the relative amounts of Mo in
the 4+ and 6+ states suggests that the Mo in the 6+ state is potentially
present as MoO3 and that the S is bound to Mo in a mix
of 4+ and 6+ states, i.e., MoSO4 and Mo2(SO4)3, which may both be present on the MoS2/C samples. It is interesting to note that different sputtering times
result in different chemical compositions of MoS2 upon
the nanocarbon surface. Note that it has been shown in a study by
Latiff et al.31 that MoOx compounds are not effective catalysts of the HER. However,
it is clear that the surface for the most beneficial HER activity
corresponds to MoS2 (see Table 1) from sputtering for 45 min, which has the
optimal composition. Our observation agrees with independent reports
in terms of electrocatalyst composition related to HER performance.32

Previous work by Rowley-Neale et al.22 has demonstrated that it is possible to incorporate
a nanomaterial
into the bulk ink of an SPE to fabricate mass-producible and electrocatalytic
SPEs, which have scales of economy and are consequently of very low
cost. Utilizing the SPE fabrication technique described in that study,
summarized in the Experimental Section, the
optimized 45 min MoS2/C variant was incorporated into the
bulk ink of SPEs at a percentage of 2.5, 5.0, 7.5, and 10.0% MoS2/C (see Experimental Section), these
are denoted as MoS2/C-SPEs. The MoS2/C-SPEs
were explored toward the HER, the results of which are presented in Table 1 and Figure 2A. All of the MoS2/C-SPEs display greater HER activity than bare/unmodified SPEs, with
a clear trend of increased HER activity with a larger percentage incorporation
of MoS2/C. Thus, the 10% MoS2/C-SPE displays
the most electrocatalytic behavior toward the HER with an onset potential,
current density at −0.75 V (vs SCE), and Tafel slope values
of −0.45 V (vs SCE) (see Figure S8), −1.81 mA cm–2, and 45 mV dec–1. The optimal electrocatalytic ability of the 10% MoS2/C-SPE is likely due to it having the largest mass incorporation
of MoS2/C and, thus, as the work of Kibsgaard and co-workers33 suggests, the greatest availability of electrocatalytic
edge sites as well as the most beneficial electrical connection between
the electrode, electrocatalyst, and electrolyte, therefore the most
improved HER catalysis. The relative percentage standard deviations
(relative standard deviation (RSD)) for the HER onset potential and
achievable currents at −0.75 V for the 10% MoS2/C-SPE
were found to be 0.7 and 4.6% (N = 5), respectively.
These small RSD values attest to the reproducibility of the screen-printing
technique and the electrodes herein fabricated.

examination of a 10% MoS2/C-SPE via LSV (scan rate: 100
mV s–1 (vs SCE)) was performed between the potential
range of 0 and −1.4 V, repeated for 1000 cycles; this figure
shows the first scan (black line), 10th (red line) scan, 100th (blue)
scan, and 1000th scan (green line). Note that the inset displays the
current output achieved when the potential was held at −0.75
V (vs SCE).

It was important to assess
the signal output stability of the MoS2/C-SPEs. This was
undertaken by cycling a 10% MoS2/C-SPE 1000 times between
0 and −1.5 V (vs SCE) at 100 mV
s–1 and holding the potential at −0.75 V
(vs SCE) for 36 000 s. In both cases, the current output of
the 10% MoS2/C-SPE was recorded and displayed in Figure 2B. Note that a carbon
counter electrode was utilized during experiments to prevent Pt migration
onto the working electrode, which would lead to a convolution of the
experiment’s outcome.34 It was observed
that there was a gradual increase of 25.9% in the achievable current
from the 1st to the 1000th scan. This is likely to be due to the 0.5
M H2SO4 electrolyte partially corroding the
binding polymers of the graphitic ink, which leads to a greater number
of exposed catalytic edge sites capable of H+ binding or
that the electrode surface becomes less hydrophobic over the duration
of the test and thus has a greater potential for interaction of the
MoS2/C with the electrolyte,22 creating more favorable triple phase boundaries. In the case of
the chronoamperometry (see Figure 2B, inset), there was a relatively steep decrease in
current output from 141 to 124 μA after 10 000 s; following
this, there was a steady decrease to 119 μA until 36 000
s. Maintaining the potential in a Faradaic region, as we have done
herein, will result in the constant production of hydrogen via the
HER, this constant bubbling will likely cause a mechanical delamination
of the catalyst from the electrode’s surface resulting in the
observed degradation of current signal output.

3 Conclusions
In this paper, we have implemented and optimized a magnetron sputtering
technique to coat a nanocarbon support with MoS2, for the
first time, and developed an effective and stable HER catalyst (MoS2/C). The optimized sputtering time was found to correspond
to 45 min, at which the most beneficial HER catalysis was observed.
Through a thorough XPS analysis, it was determined that a 45 min deposition
time correlated with the highest levels of MoS2 present
on the sample surfaces, thus explaining the optimized catalysis. The
45 min MoS2/C was also incorporated into bespoke screen-printable
inks at an optimized mass ratio of 10% MoS2/C to 90% graphitic.
The signal output in regard to HER activity of the subsequently fabricated
MoS2/C-SPEs was found to be greatly superior to that of
a bare/unmodified SPE with a 0.45 V (vs SCE) decrease in the HER onset
potential and a 1.70 mA cm–2 increase in the achievable
current density (recorded at −0.75 V (vs SCE)). The use of
magnetron sputtering in this manner to fabricate the MoS2/C enables the mass production of a MoS2-based electrocatalyst
on an industrial scale without the requirement for time-consuming
and low-yield traditional exfoliation methods or the subsequent complexities
of trying to electrically wire a 2D-nanomateral to an electrode. MoS2/C-SPEs, therefore, offer a promising, cost-effective, tailorable,
and mass-producible alternative to Pt and Pt containing materials
as the cathodic material involved within an electrolyzer’s
three-phase boundary.

4.1 Chemicals
All chemicals utilized
were of analytical grade and were used as received from Sigma-Aldrich
(U.K.)/Alfa Aesar without any further purification; this includes
the carbon nanopowder (Super P conductive carbon black; diameter:
40–45 nm, >99% purity (see Figure S9)).35 The MoS2 sputtering target
(>99.5% purity) bonded to the copper backing plate was purchased
from
Teer Coatings (Teer Coatings Ltd., Droitwich, U.K.); the geometrical
dimensions of the target are 300 mm × 100 mm × 3 mm. All
of the solutions herein utilized were prepared with deionized water
of resistivity not less than 18.2 MΩ cm.

4.2 Electrochemical
Measurements
All
electrochemical measurements described herein were performed using
an Ivium CompactStat (Netherlands) potentiostat. The measurements
were implemented utilizing a three-electrode system, where a Pt wire
and saturated calomel electrode (SCE) acted as the counter and reference
electrodes, respectively. The working electrodes used were either
bare/unmodified screen-printed electrodes (SPEs), which were subsequently
drop-casted (where an aliquot of the liquid suspended catalyst is
deposited using a manual pipette) with MoS2/C or SPEs that
had MoS2/C incorporated into their bulk inks to produce
bulk-modified SPEs. The SPEs were produced via screen printing using
an appropriate stencil, which resulted in an electrode working area
with a diameter and area of 3 mm and 0.0707 cm2, respectively.22,32 A DEK 248 screen-printing machine (DEK, Weymouth, U.K.) was used
to screen print the electrode configuration onto a polyester (Autostat,
250 μm thickness) flexible film after which this layer was cured
in a fan oven at 60 °C/30 min. A dielectric paste (product code
D2070423D5; Gwent Electronic Materials Ltd., U.K.) was then utilized
to insulate the working electrode area of the printed design from
its electrical connection. After curing at 60 °C/30 min, the
screen-printed electrodes/surfaces were ready to be used and were
connected via an edge connector to ensure a secure electrical connection.36 To fabricate the MoS2/C-SPEs, the
MoS2/C was incorporated into a preexisting carbon-graphite
ink formulation (product code C2000802P2; Gwent Electronic Materials
Ltd., U.K.). Prior to this study, a novel MoS2 ink was
considered using a range of solvents, binders, and graphitic materials;
however, it was then shown that the produced SPEs had poor/nonexistent
electrochemical responses in regard to the HER and oxygen reduction
reaction (ORR).32 The MoS2/C
was, therefore, incorporated into the commercially purchased ink on
the basis of the mass of particulate (MP) to the mass of the graphitic ink (MI) giving % = (MP/MI) × 10; this approach allows for an effective way to
electrically wire/connect the nanomaterial while facilitating the
production of mass-producible and reproducible electrocatalytic electrode
architectures. The maximum % incorporation of MoS2/C into
the ink formula was found to correspond to 40%, as percentage incorporations
over this amount resulted in an increase in the viscosity of the ink
to such an extent that it was no longer printable via the screen-printing
technique herein utilized. It is possible to obtain an estimation
as to the total weight incorporation of MoS2/C into each
individual SPE by weighing the substrate pre- and postprinting and
taking into account the percentage of incorporation. Using this method,
it was determined that an average weight of 63.4, 126.4, 252.8, and
505.6 μg of MoS2/C was incorporated into the 2.5,
5.0, 7.5, and 10.0% MoS2/C-SPEs. This is, however, an estimation
and we, therefore, utilize a percentage denotation throughout this
study. The fabricated MoS2/C graphitic inks were screen-printed
onto the carbon layer of a SPE and subsequently cured for 30 min at
60 °C after which they were ready to be tested. For comparative
purposes, a platinum polycrystalline electrode (1.6 mm, BAS) was tested
as a working electrode toward the HER in the same conditions as the
fabricated MoS2/C-SPEs and bare/unmodified SPEs, to allow
for a direct comparison.

The HER measurements were carried out
in 0.5 M H2SO4 with the sulfuric acid solution
used being of the highest possible grade available from Sigma-Aldrich
(99.999%, double distilled for trace metal analysis). The 0.5 M H2SO4 solutions used in the HER was thoroughly deoxygenated
via the vigorous bubbling of pure nitrogen through the solution, as
is common within the literature.5 It was
essential to remove all traces of oxygen within the test solution,
as any oxygen present could be reduced via the oxygen reduction reaction,
which could possibly cause an alteration in the observed signal output,
leading to a convolution within the results. It should be noted that
the HER was determined to start at the potential when the current
density deviates from the background current density by 25 μA
cm–2, as is common within the literature.5,22

4.3 Physicochemical Characterization
To perform
a thorough and independent physicochemical characterization,
the bespoke fabricated MoS2/C was analyzed by Raman spectroscopy,
scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy
(TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS). For a full description of the equipment specifications, interested
readers are directed to the Supporting Information.

4.4 Fabrication of Bespoke MoS2-Coated
Carbon Nanoparticles via Magnetron Sputtering
MoS2 coatings were fabricated in a single-stage process using an arrangement
similar to the one reported by Ratova et al.,18,19 in which particulates, in this case carbon nanoparticles, are manipulated
under the magnetrons in an oscillating bowl. In brief, the vacuum
coating system used included two planar 300 mm × 100 mm type
II unbalanced magnetrons installed through the top of the chamber
in the closed-field configuration facing the oscillator bowl. The
MoS2 target was fitted to one of the magnetrons, whereas
the other magnetron was covered with the blanking plate and used for
closing the magnetic field lines between the magnetrons. The target
was sputtered in argon at 15 sccm, and the flow of the sputtering
gas was regulated using a mass-flow controller. A 5 kW Advanced Energy
Pinnacle Plus magnetron driver was used to power the magnetron; the
sputtering was performed in pulsed direct current mode at a time-averaged
power of 500 W, a pulse frequency of 100 kHz, and duty cycle of 50%.
The exact specifics regarding the oscillating bowl can be found in
the Supporting Information. Each deposition
cycle consisted of a 5 g charge of carbon nanopowder, which was loaded
into the oscillator bowl, the chamber was then evacuated to a base
pressure of lower than 1 × 10–3 Pa. Sputtering
times of 7.5, 15, 30, 45, 60, and 120 min were used to vary the MoS2 loading on the samples. Note that this is an unlikely translation
to other systems and diligent time-controlled experiments will need
to be undertaken. A summary of the MoS2 sputtering conditions
is presented in Table 3.
