Conventionally, reactions
in aqueous solutions are prepared using
deionized (DI) water, the properties of which are related to inert
“bulk water” comprising a tetrahedral hydrogen-bonded
network. In this work, we demonstrate the distinguished benefits of
using in situ plasmon-activated water (PAW) with reduced hydrogen
bonds instead of DI water in electrochemical reactions, which generally
are governed by diffusion and kinetic controls. Compared with DI water-based
systems, the diffusion coefficient and the electron-transfer rate
constant of K3Fe(CN)6 in PAW in situ can be
increased by ca. 35 and 15%, respectively. These advantages are responsible
for the improved performance of surface-enhanced Raman scattering
(SERS). On the basis of PAW in situ, the SERS enhancement of twofold
higher intensity of rhodamine 6G and the corresponding low relative
standard deviation of 5%, which is comparable to and even better than
those based on complicated processes shown in the literature, are
encouraging.

Introduction
Water is the most commonly
used environmentally friendly solvent
for chemical reactions in solution. Compared with other solvents,
water is able to form a flexible dynamic hydrogen-bonded network,
in which hydrogen bonds (HBs) are dynamic in picoseconds,1 which makes investigating its local structure
challenging.2−4 Thus, although most properties of liquid water are
determined by its HBs,5 all of water’s
commonly recognized properties are related to inert “bulk water”
composed of tetrahedral hydrogen-bonded networks. Water as a solvent
is conventionally considered a passive spectator in chemical reactions.
Actually, liquid water has emerged as a promising active reactant
using its characteristic property of donor–bridge–acceptor
for proton transfer and electron donating.6−8 Moreover, liquid
water is conventionally considered an independent reactant. However,
as shown in the literature regarding the hydrogen evolution reaction
(HER), the interaction energy of H3O+–OH– is 46.9 kJ mol–1, but it increases
approximately 2.5 times when H3O+ associates
with an additional four water molecules by HBs.9 Meanwhile, gas-phase water is capable of catalyzing many
chemical reactions10−12 through its ability to form HBs with other molecules
because of more free water molecules being available in the gas phase,
compared with liquid-phase water with a more perfect tetrahedral symmetry.
These facts inspired us to create active liquid plasmon-activated
water (PAW) with reduced HBs from deionized (DI) water at room temperature
using hot electron transfer (HET) on resonantly illuminated gold nanoparticles
(AuNPs).13 The created PAW can be innovatively
employed as an environmentally friendly etching agent (vapor from
hot electron-activated liquid water),14 in more efficient HERs15 and in increasing
the efficiency and safety of hemodialysis.16 These innovative applications of PAW instead of conventional DI
water in green chemistry, energy, and medicine open new aspects of
the effects of liquid PAW on various water-related chemical reactions.

In surface science, compared with AgNPs, relatively stable AuNPs
with well-defined localized surface plasmon resonance bands in the
UV and near-infrared regions are applicable to surface-enhanced Raman
scattering (SERS)17,18 and HET for catalyzing chemical
reactions.19,20 To further improve the plasmonic
efficiency of HET, novel hot dog-structured Au nanorod (NR)@Cu2O NPs were designed and synthesized.21 In this unique structure, the head-exposed Au NR provides a plasmonic
enhanced local electric field at the surface of the photocatalyst
to improve the transfer of electrons. A similar strategy was proposed
for enhancing the plasmonic efficiency of HET based on Au-decorated
ZnO corn silk.22 The formation of a Schottky
barrier at the Au/ZnO interface can retard the electron–hole
recombination, thus increasing the photoelectrochemical efficiency.
With significant improvements in nanotechnology, the SERS enhancement
is correspondingly increased, as expected, making the detection of
single molecules possible.23,24 However, the reproducibility
of SERS signals is also an important parameter of concern because
of its reliable application. Unfortunately, high SERS enhancement
generally corresponds to low reproducibility and to poor stability
of SERS signals, which makes its application unreliable.25,26 Core@shell and array structures are two popularly employed strategies
to improve SERS enhancement while maintaining both reproducibility
and stability, but the fabrication procedures are correspondingly
complicated.27,28

By using femtosecond transient
absorption spectroscopy with visible
pump and infrared probe to observe generation of injected electrons,
plasmon-induced electron transfer from 10 nm Au nanodots to TiO2 nanocrystalline film was directly observed. It was revealed
that the reaction time was within 240 fs and the yield was about 40%.29 On the other hand, reaction and diffusion rates
in water cage are interesting. The much higher intramolecular kinetic
isotope effects (KIEs) compared with the intermolecular KIEs of the
same chemical reaction, R–H + •OH →
R• + H2O, indicate a high degree of mobility
of the two reaction partners inside of the solvent cage.30 As shown in our previous study,31 the activity of created PAW decays after a few days. Thus,
we developed a multifunctional excited AuNP-decorated artificial kidney
with efficient hemodialysis and therapeutic potential using PAW created
in situ.32 In this work, we demonstrate
the innovative advantages of in situ preparation of PAW used in electrochemical
reactions with a higher diffusion coefficient and electron transfer
rate, which generally govern electrochemical reactions. The effects
of the in situ preparation of PAW on the correspondingly increased
SERS signal and on improved signal reproducibility are also demonstrated
in reference to traditional DI water.

Results and Discussion
Electrochemical
Reactions in PAW of Roughened Au Substrates
Prepared Using PAW
As shown in the literature regarding SERS
studies,33,34 controllable and reproducible surface roughness
was readily produced by controlling electrochemical oxidation–reduction
cycle (ORC) treatments using aqueous solutions containing chlorite-electrolytes. Figure 1a shows the image
of in situ production of PAW. Figure 1b demonstrates typical triangular voltammetric curves
in the fifth scan for anodic dissolution of Au and cathodic redeposition
of Au on substrates in solutions of 0.1 M KCl based on PAW with reduced
HBs and DI water with stronger HBs.13 In
these plots, the terms “DIW” and “PAW”,
respectively, represent ORC procedures performed in DI water and prepared
PAW, without additional resonant illumination of green light emitting
diodes (LEDs) in the experiments. The terms “DIW in situ”
and “PAW in situ” represent ORC procedures, respectively,
performed in DI water and prepared PAW under resonant irradiation
of green LEDs in the experiments. Basically, the dissolution of Au
and the redeposition of AuNPs onto substrates were easier in the PAW-based
electrolytes, as indicated from the enhanced currents, than those
in the DI water-based electrolytes. In the ORC treatment for roughening
the Au substrate, AuNPs were deposited on the Au substrate. Therefore,
water with stronger HBs at the AuNPs on the Au substrate under resonant
illumination could be transferred into PAW with reduced HBs.13 Compared with the “DIW” sample,
the cathodic redeposition currents at ca. 0.33 V versus Ag/AgCl, respectively,
increased by 2.7 and 4.3% for the “DIW in situ” and
“PAW” samples. These increases were more significant
for the “PAW in situ” sample, which increased by 32.5%.
With up to 20 scans, as shown in Figure 1c, these increases in cathodic redeposition
currents at ca. 0.33 V versus Ag/AgCl were more significant. Compared
with the “DIW” sample, the cathodic redeposition currents,
respectively, increased by 9.5 and 10.0% for the “DIW in situ”
and “PAW” samples. The increased currents between the
“DIW in situ” and “PAW” samples approached
a slight difference with increasing scans. This means that the original
DI water with stronger HBs at the AuNPs on the Au substrate under
resonant illumination indeed was transformed into in situ PAW with
reduced HBs. Similarly, these increases were more distinguishable
for the “PAW in situ” sample, that increased by 41.6%.
This great increase of 41.6% compared with those of 9.5 and 10.0%
indicated that the original PAW with reduced HBs at the AuNPs on the
Au substrate under resonant illumination could be more easily transferred
into in situ PAW with greater numbers of weaker HBs available. This
also suggests that a synergistic effect on further reducing HBs of
water indeed occurred for PAW with intrinsically reduced HBs on an
AuNP-deposited Au electrode under resonant illumination. It is recognized
that the obtained currents well depend on the kinetics- and diffusion-controls
in electrochemical reactions. These results suggested that the employed
KCl electrolytes could diffuse more efficiently in ORCs, and higher
electron transfer rates could occur at the Au electrode in PAW-based
solutions, especially in in situ-based PAW solutions, which contributed
to the obtained higher currents at constant applied potentials. The
different effects using PAW instead of conventional DI water on the
corresponding ORC treatments for roughening Au substrates could result
from the different respective kinetics- and diffusion-controlled reactions,
which were shown in their significantly different cyclic voltammograms
(CVs). These interesting phenomena are discussed below. After preparing
roughened Au substrates as described in Figure 1c, the same substrates were further examined
to obtain their specific surface areas, as shown in Figure 1d regarding the corresponding
CVs at 50 mV s–1 of 50 mM K3Fe(CN)6 in DI water-based solutions. An additional blank sample of
a mechanically polished Au electrode without further ORC treatment
was also used for reference. It can be observed that, as expected,
both anodic and cathodic peak currents based on roughened Au substrates
were higher than those of the blank flat Au electrode. Compared with
the cathodic peak current of the blank Au electrode, those values,
respectively, increased by ca. 7.6, 10.9, 10.9, and 11.5% for the
“DIW”, “DIW in situ”, “PAW”,
and “PAW in situ” samples. Similarly, the increased
currents for the “DIW in situ” and “PAW”
samples based on waters with reduced HBs were at the same level, which
were higher that that of the “DIW” sample based on water
with stronger HBs. This increase was slightly enhanced for the “PAW
in situ” sample based on water with greater numbers of reduced
HBs. The specific surface areas of roughened Au electrodes can be
calculated according to the Randles–Sevcik equation35 1  where Ip is the
peak current, n is the number of electrons transferred
(n = 1 for this system), A is the
specific surface area of the electrode, D is the
diffusion coefficient, C is the concentration of
the electrolyte, and υ is the scan rate. In experiments using
the same electrolyte, concentration, and DI water at the same scan
rate, the specific surface area is proportional to the recorded current.
Compared with the blank sample with a surface area of 0.238 cm2, the calculated specific surface areas were 0.256, 0.264,
0.264, and 0.265 cm2 for the same geometric area.

Figure 2 shows CVs
of different scans using the model probe molecules of K3Fe(CN)6 in different waters with and without resonant
illumination in experiments on roughened Au substrates (“DIW”
samples prepared using DI water without resonant illumination). According
to eq 1, the peak current
is proportional to the square root of the diffusion coefficient. The
calculated diffusion coefficient in PAW water with resonant illumination
at 50 mV s–1 was 1.54 × 10–6 cm2 s–1 [with a relative standard deviation
(RSD) of 6.1%]. The calculated diffusion coefficient in DI water without
resonant illumination was 1.14 × 10–6 cm2 s–1 (with an RSD of 8.6%). The other two
sets of reproducible experiments are demonstrated in Figure S1. This was a ca. 35% higher diffusion coefficient
in PAW with resonant illumination in the experiment at 50 mV s–1 compared with that in DI water without resonant illumination
in the experiment at 50 mV s–1. Moreover, this increase
in the diffusion coefficient (1.39 × 10–6 cm2 s–1, RSD = 8.3%) was ca. 22% of the magnitude
for the experiment in PAW with resonant illumination on the roughened
Au substrate (the “PAW in situ” sample) prepared using
PAW with resonant illumination (calculated from Figure S2). This suggests that PAW in situ had a function
of enhancing the diffusion ability of species in water. The reason
might be attributed to the reduced size of hydrated Fe(CN)63–/4– in the water. With a significantly
reduced hydrogen-bonded structure, hydration is associated with large
water clusters due to the strong HB network of water. Contrarily,
breaking the HB structure can reduce the sizes of water clusters,
resulting in higher mobility of Fe(CN)63–/4––H2O. Similarly, the diffusion coefficients increased
by ca. 36, 50, 40, and 46% in PAW with resonant illumination compared
with experiments in the DI water system without resonant illumination
in experiments at 100, 200, 400, and 600 mV s–1,
respectively. Moreover, these diffusion coefficients increased by
ca. 30, 43, 32, and 36% in PAW with resonant illumination on the roughened
Au substrate (“PAW in situ” samples) prepared using
PAW with resonant illumination (calculated from Figure S2) compared with those in the DI water system without
resonant illumination in experiments at 100, 200, 400, and 600 mV
s–1, respectively. In addition, as the scan rate
(υ) increased from 50 to 600 mV s–1, the redox
peak currents of Fe(CN)63–/4– simultaneously
increased. The low-conductivity solution, which cannot respond instantly
at high υ because of the slow electron transfer rate in the
absence of electrolytes, resulted in more positive and negative shifts
in Epa and Epc, respectively, as υ increased. Furthermore, when the anodic
peak-to-cathodic peak separation was >0.2 V and υ was >200
mV
s–1, the peak potentials were proportional to the
natural logarithm of υ (Figure 2c,d). Two linear equations (with most of R2 values of >0.999) were obtained for the anodic and
cathodic
peak potentials. According to eqs 2 and 3(36) 2   3  where E0′ is the formal potential (i.e., the
average of Epa and Epc), α is the
electron-transfer coefficient, n is the number of
electrons transferred, T is the absolute temperature, R is the gas constant, F is Faraday’s
constant, ka and kc are the slopes of anodic and cathodic peaks potentials, respectively,
and versus ln υ. ks is the apparent
heterogeneous electron-transfer rate constant. The n value of Fe(CN)63–/4– was 1. Therefore, the ks constant can be calculated to be 0.1083 s–1 (with an RSD of 3.2%) for PAW with resonant illuminations
in the experiments, which was higher (ca. 15% of the magnitude) than
that of 0.0945 s–1 (with an RSD of 0.3%) for DI
water without resonant illumination in the experiments. Moreover,
this increase in the electron-transfer rate constant was ca. 16% of
the magnitude for the experiment in PAW with resonant illumination
on the roughened Au substrate (the “PAW in situ” sample)
prepared using PAW with resonant illumination (0.1097 s–1 with an RSD of 9.7%) calculated from Figure S2. This indicates that interactions of Fe(CN)63–/4– with its surrounding water molecules could
influence the ability of electron transfer. Fe(CN)63–/4– being embedded within large water clusters
hindered its electron transfer. Moreover, we performed a similar experiment
in DI water as shown in Figure 2a, but the CV experiment of K3Fe(CN)6 was performed in a completely dark atmosphere, not in a normal condition
with indoor lighting of fluorescent lamps, as shown in Figure S3. The calculated diffusion coefficient
and electron-transfer rate constant were 1.06 × 10–6 cm2 s–1 and 0.0880 s–1, respectively, which were ca. 7 and 7% lower in magnitude compared
with those corresponding values in experiments performed in DI water
under normal indoor lights. These results suggest that available indoor
lighting of fluorescent lamps with a full visible wavelength are also
effective in creating in situ PAW from DI water on the roughened Au
substrate. Certainly, this effectiveness was less than that with resonant
illumination of green LEDs.

Performances of SERS Signals on SERS-Active Au Substrates Prepared
Using PAW and DI Water
Figure 3 shows the Raman spectra of rhodamine 6G (R6G) adsorbed
onto roughened Au substrates (similar to the “PAW in situ”
sample shown in Figure 1c) prepared in 0.1 M KCl using PAW with resonant illumination in
ORC treatments with different scans. They are characteristic of Raman
spectra of R6G.37−39 The band at ca. 1184 cm–1 was assigned
to the C–H in-plane bend mode; bands at ca. 1313 and 1576 cm–1 were assigned to N–H in-plane bend modes;
and bands at ca. 1361, 1510, and 1649 cm–1 were
assigned to C–C stretching modes. Our previous study40 suggested that 25 cycles was the optimum number
to obtain the strongest SERS effect in roughening the Au substrate
using ORC treatment in a DI water-based solution without resonant
illumination. Increasing the ORC cycles can increase the specific
surface area available. However, subsequent Au deposition would fill
up the porous surface of the Au already deposited on the substrate
if the number of cycles exceeds the optimum value. This results in
a lower SERS effect demonstrated by increasing the number of cycles
beyond 25 cycles. In this work, the ORC treatment was performed in
PAW-based solutions with resonant illumination, in which electrolytes
could diffuse and electrons could transfer to electrodes more efficiently.
Thus, as shown in Figure 3, the observed optimum number of cycles to obtain the strongest
SERS effect using the common ORC treatment for 20 cycles was sufficient.
The obtained SERS intensity was comparable to that with 25 cycles,
which is generally used in SERS studies. The SERS effect was decided
based on the SERS intensity of R6G of the strongest bands (at ca.
1361 cm–1). This suggests that the treatment time
for obtaining the strongest SERS effect can be significantly reduced
by ca. 20% in the commonly employed ORC method using in situ PAW instead
of conventional DI water. In addition to enhanced SERS intensity,
the reproducibility of the SERS intensities is also a concerned topic
in its reliable application. As shown in Figure 3, the extremely low RSD of 4% for 20 scans
compared with a little higher RSD of 14% for 25 scans indicated that
the optimal SERS-active Au substrate could be prepared using the ORC
treatment for 20 scans in PAW under resonant illumination. This developed
SERS-active Au substrate with excellent reproducibility using the
easy one-step electrochemical method was comparable to and even better
than those of SERS-active metal arrays based on complicated procedures
shown in the literature.41−44 The effect of the number of cycles used in the ORC
treatment on the corresponding SERS performance of the roughened Au
substrate (similar to the “PAW” sample shown in Figure 1c) was also examined
using PAW without resonant illuminations in the ORC treatment, as
shown in Figure S4. Similarly, 20 scans
used in the ORC treatment were the optimal number of cycles from the
viewpoints of the SERS effect and its reproducibility.

Figure 3 Raman spectra of 2 ×
10–5 M R6G adsorbed
onto roughened Au substrates (samples “PAW in situ”)
prepared by using PAW with resonant illumination under different ORC
cycles. Spectra were obtained from five selected sites on the same
substrate. (a) With 15 cycles. (b) With 20 cycles. (c) With 25 cycles.

Figure 4 shows the
SERS spectra of probed R6G adsorbed on SERS-active substrates produced
employing different kinds of water with and without resonant illuminations
in ORC treatments for 20 scans. The corresponding RSDs based on five
measurements are also shown in these plots. The four prepared SERS-active
Au substrates were similar to those shown in Figure 1c. Interestingly, the average relative SERS
intensities of R6G observed on the Au substrates produced in DI water-based
solutions with resonant illumination (the “DIW in situ”
sample, Figure 4b)
and in the PAW-based solution without resonant illumination (the “PAW”
sample, Figure 4c)
all increased, compared with that obtained on the Au substrate produced
in the DI water-based solution without resonant illumination (the
“DIW” sample, Figure 4a). The former and latter increased by ca. 67 and 52%,
respectively. Moreover, this increase could be enhanced to ca. 2.1-fold
(ca. 3-fold for other probe molecules of deposited polypyrrole, see Figure S5) for the Au substrate produced in the
PAW-based solution with resonant illumination (the “PAW in
situ” sample, Figure 4d). Detailed calculations, compared with the DIW system, the
increases in SERS intensities at 1184 (C–H in-plane bend mode),
1313 (N–H in-plane bend mode), 1361 (C–C stretching
mode), and 1510 cm–1 (C–C stretching mode)
could be enhanced to 2.7-, 1.8-, 2.1-, and 2.1-fold, respectively,
for the PAW in situ system. In obtaining the relative intensities,
the normalized Raman intensity was used. This was calculated from
the ratio of the strongest signal intensity of R6G adsorbed on the
SERS-active substrate produced in the PAW-based solution to that of
R6G adsorbed on the SERS-active substrate produced in the DI water-based
solution without resonant illumination. Thus, it is not necessary
for making a correction on the normal Raman scattering intensity to
account for differences in sampling geometry and scattering phenomena,
as shown in the literature.45 Moreover,
the RSD of the SERS intensity of R6G adsorbed on the ORC treatment-prepared
“DIW” sample prepared in DI water with strong HBs was
acceptable at ca. 16%, as shown in Figure 4a. Encouragingly, this RSD was significantly
reduced to 7% for the “DIW in situ” and “PAW”
samples prepared in PAW-containing water with reduced HBs, as shown
in Figure 4b,c. In
particular, this reduction in RSD (5%) (RSD 6% for other probe molecules
of deposited polypyrrole, see Figure S5) was more significant for the “PAW in situ” sample
prepared in water with greater numbers of reduced HBs, as shown in Figure 4d. Examining the
results shown in Figures 1, 2, and 4,
it is found that a higher diffusion coefficient for electrolytes in
a solution and a higher electron-transfer rate constant are responsible
for the higher current recorded in the ORC treatment for obtaining
a SERS-active Au substrate. Correspondingly, these higher diffusion
coefficients and electron-transfer rate constants are responsible
for the higher SERS activity and the better signal reproducibility.
The electrochemical ORC procedure in a DI water-based system is a
good method to prepare a SERS-active substrate with acceptable signal
reproducibility with an RSD of ca. 16%. This RSD can be further reduced
to 5% using an in situ PAW system (with a higher diffusion coefficient
for electrolytes in a solution and a higher electron-transfer rate
constant) in the ORC procedure.

Figure 4 Raman spectra of 2 × 10–5 M R6G adsorbed
onto roughened Au substrates prepared by ORC treatments at 500 mV
s–1 for 20 scans in 0.1 M KCl by using different
waters under resonant illumination or not (the same experimental conditions
shown in Figure 1c).
Spectra were obtained from five selected sites on the same substrate.
(a) Using DI water without resonant illumination. (b) Using DI water
with resonant illumination. (c) Using PAW without resonant illumination.
(d) Using PAW with resonant illumination. The calculated RSDs based
on SERS intensities of R6G of the strongest bands (at ca. 1361 cm–1) at five selected sites on differently roughened
Au substrates are shown in the individual plots.

In addition, the good reproducibility of the SERS signal
of probed
R6G obtained on SERS-active substrates produced in PAW-based solutions
was further investigated using SERS mapping. Point-by-point maps recorded
from an area of 20 × 20 μm2 with 2 μm
steps for SERS-active Au substrates produced in DI water- and PAW-based
solutions with or without resonant illumination are demonstrated in Figure 5. In an individual
plot, the variation in the color of the block is dependent on the
highest and the lowest SERS intensities of R6G on the area for each
sample. Thus, blocks with different colors represent different intensities
of SERS signals of R6G. The maps were obtained using the band area
of the baseline-corrected band at ca. 1361 cm–1 (the
strongest SERS band of R6G). The more uniform color of the blocks
just means the more uniform measured SERS intensities on the area.
As shown in Figure 5a, the SERS map on the Au substrate (the “DIW” sample)
prepared in DI water-based solutions without resonant illumination
demonstrated obviously large spatial variations in SERS intensities.
Encouragingly, the intensity maps on roughened Au substrates showed
more uniform when the substrates were prepared in DI water-based solutions
with resonant illumination (the “DIW in situ” sample, Figure 5b) and in PAW-based
solutions without resonant illumination (the “PAW” sample, Figure 5c). Most importantly,
the intensity map on the roughened Au substrate exhibited very uniform
color for the substrate prepared in full-time PAW-based solutions
with resonant illumination (the “PAW in situ” sample, Figure 5d). These phenomena
were consistent with observations shown in Figure 4. This effect can be ascribed to the easier
reduction of Au on the Au substrate in PAW-containing solutions with
reduced HBs, in which electrolytes diffuse and electrons transfer
at electrodes more efficiently. Thus, metal NPs with hot spots can
be more uniformly deposited onto substrates. This available strategy
for obtaining uniform SERS-active substrates is quite easy and convenient.

0.1 M KCl by using different waters under resonant illumination or
not (the same experimental conditions shown in Figure 1c). (a) Using DI water without resonant illumination.

Figure 6 demonstrates
typical microstructures of AuNP-deposited substrates prepared in 0.1
M chloride-containing aqueous solutions after electrochemical ORC
treatments. Compared with the “DIW” sample prepared
in DI water with strong HBs shown in Figure 6a, it can clearly be observed that more even
surfaces with closely packed NPs were demonstrated for the “DIW
in situ” and “PAW” samples prepared in PAW-containing
water with reduced HBs, as shown in Figure 6b,c. A similar phenomenon was also observed
for the “PAW in situ” sample prepared in water with
greater numbers of reduced HBs, as shown in Figure 6d. Because molecules located between the
two metallic NPs displayed the greatest SERS enhancement,46,47 this kind of microstructure with closely packed NPs can provide
more and more even chances for probe molecules to be adsorbed onto
the two metallic NPs. Therefore, more and more even hot spots should
be observed on these PAW-based SERS-active Au substrates.

Surface morphologies of the roughened Au substrates
prepared in
different 0.1 M KCl-based waters were also examined by atomic force
microscopy (AFM). Figure S6 shows 2D surface
images of roughened Au substrates. As shown in all four of these images,
structural features of the redeposited AuNPs demonstrated dimensions
of ca. 100 nm, which is suitable for SERS studies.48,49 Calculated average values of the mean roughness (Ra) on roughened Au substrates prepared using PAW and DI
water with and without resonant illuminations were 92.3 (RSD 15.8%),
66.9 (RSD 15.6%), 66.6 (RSD 9.9%), and 45.2 (RSD 5.0%) nm for the
“DIW”, “DIW in situ”, “PAW”,
and “PAW in situ” samples, respectively. In the calculations,
we obtained five Ra values, which were
automatically calculated from a program attached to the instrument,
based on five randomly selected lines on the same sample (see Figure S7 of the “DIW” sample for
an explanation). The five random lines were roughly equally spaced
across the entire image and were similarly selected for different
samples to the greatest extent. The average Ra of individual samples was determined from the three sets
of medium Ra values, removing the largest
and smallest ones. The higher value of Ra recorded for the DI water-based system without resonant illumination
in preparation suggests that this AuNP-deposited substrate was rougher
because of uneven sizes and a low density of deposited AuNPs on the
substrate. Interestingly, Ra values were
markedly reduced by ca. 28% in magnitude for the “DIW in situ”
and “PAW” samples prepared in PAW-containing systems
with reduced HBs because of more even surfaces with closely packed
NPs. Moreover, this reduction was enhanced to ca. 51% in magnitude
for the Au substrate produced in the PAW-based solution with resonant
illumination (the “PAW in situ” sample). This phenomenon
indicates that an even AuNP-deposited surface can be created employing
the PAW-containing water instead of general DI water in the ORC treatment,
especially when using the PAW-based solution with resonant illumination
in preparation. This promises that the SERS technique can be reliably
applied in analytical chemistry, which was discussed before in Figures 4 and 5. These encouraging results all suggest that excellent reproducible
SERS signals from easy one-step electrochemical methods are practicable
using in situ PAW developed in this work.

Conclusions
We
successfully utilized the created in situ PAW with significantly
reduced HBs to more efficiently perform electrochemical reactions.
Compared with conventional DI water, the diffusion coefficient and
electron-transfer rate constant on an Au substrate in this in situ
PAW were, respectively, increased by ca. 35 and 15% in magnitude.
These marked increases were responsible for more efficient chemical
reactions, which generally are governed by diffusion and kinetic controls,
in this newly developed water-based solvent. To prepare the SERS-active
Au substrate using simple ORC treatment in this in situ PAW instead
of DI water, the preparation time can be significantly reduced. Moreover,
the SERS effect and signal reproducibility were all improved using
the in situ PAW system. In particular, the extremely low RSD of 4%
of SERS signals based on this easy one-step electrochemical method
was comparable to and even better than those of SERS-active metal
arrays based on complicated procedures shown in the literature. These
findings that in situ PAW can intrinsically improve chemical reactions
like some organic solvents are the first to be reported in the literature.
These promise it to be applicable in environmentally friendly water-based
relative fields to investigate innovative aspects of effects of liquid
water with reduced HBs.

Experimental Section
Preparations of PAW ex
Situ and PAW in Situ
PAW (ex
situ) was prepared using a previously described method.13 PAW in situ was prepared in a DI water-filled
glass cell containing a roughened Au substrate with AuNPs. In the
experiments, the glass cell with DI water was illuminated with green
LEDs to create PAW in situ at the AuNPs (see details in the Supporting Information).

Preparation of the SERS-Active
Au Substrate
The Au
electrode was cycled in a deoxygenated 0.1 M KCl aqueous solution
(40 mL based on PAW or DI water) from −0.28 to +1.22 V versus
Ag/AgCl at 500 mV s–1 with and without resonant
illumination (green LEDs) for 20 scans. Respective durations at the
cathodic and anodic vertices were 10 and 5 s, respectively. Finally,
the potential was held at the cathodic vertex before the roughened
Au electrode was taken from the solution and thoroughly rinsed with
DI water (see details in the Supporting Information).
