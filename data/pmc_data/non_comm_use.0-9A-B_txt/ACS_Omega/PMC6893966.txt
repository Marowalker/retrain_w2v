In this work, a robust and reliable electrochemical sensor
was
developed for sensitive detection of non-electroactive melamine (MEL)
using a modified glassy carbon electrode with ascorbic acid (AA) as
the active recognition element. To increase the current signal of
AA, the working electrode was successively modified with l-arginine (l-Arg) and reduced graphene oxide–copper
nanoflower composite. The voltammetry measurements denoted that the
hydrogen bonding was formed between AA and MEL. Using the optimum
conditions, the proposed enhanced sensor can detect MEL concentrations
ranging from 10 × 10–9 to 9.0 × 10–8 M with a detection limit of 5.0 × 10–9 M that is proportional to the decrease of AA in the anodic peak
current. Finally, the proposed sensor was successfully applied for
the determination of MEL in commercial infant milk samples and good
recovery values were obtained.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Melamine (MEL) is a nitrogenous
compound that is used in the production
of glues, resins, laminates, adhesives, and plastics. Because of the
presence of a high concentration of nitrogen (approximately 66%),
MEL has been used as an adulterant in milk and milk powder industries.
In 2007, a sequence of events related to MEL-contaminated animal feed
and food occurred.1 Simultaneously, because
of the expenditure of infant milk powder that contains MEL, some important
incidents broke out such as acute renal failure, kidney failure, and
death particularly among children. The formation of hyperplasia in
the urinary bladder and bladder stones were associated with MEL exposition.2 The MEL toxicity was a source for kidney damage
for extended time.3 MEL also produces an
insoluble complex with cyanuric acid that results in subsequent tissue
damage and crystallization such as urolithiasis.4 Therefore, it is necessary to develop robust and reliable
methods for the sensitive detection of MEL for food sample monitoring.

For the detection of MEL concentration, various analytical methods
such as high-performance liquid chromatography,5 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay,6 ion-pair chromatography,7 capillary electrophoresis,8 and chromatography–mass spectrometry9 were developed. These analytical methods suffer
from a diverse range of limitations including high-price equipment
and/or reagents and time-consuming pretreatments. On the other hand,
electrochemical methods are more advantageous because of their high
sensitivity, simplicity in preparation and design, fast response,
and low cost for detection of MEL. Unluckily, MEL has comparatively
low electroactivity and good existence with 1, 3, and 5-triazine skeleton
of the cyanamide trimmer. The electro-oxidation reaction of the amino
group within MEL is responsible for its weak electrochemical response.
For MEL detection, a few electrochemical methods were employed that
have a low detection limit.10 Liao et al.
used a disposable screen-printed carbon electrode where uric acid
(UA) was used as the recognition element.11 At the prepared electrode, the adsorptive behavior of MEL in the
prepared electrode caused oxidation of UA. Furthermore, the decline
in peak currents can be used for MEL sensing.12 Liu et al. developed an electrochemical sensor for the detection
of MEL in milk using hexacyanoferrate and para-aminobenzoic
acid as a molecularly imprinted polymer.13 In another report, Jin et al. used a graphite electrode with paraffin
modified with MEL, silver nanoparticles, chitosan, and polyquercetin
using the molecularly imprinted sensing method.14 However, most of the reported techniques use the complex
electrode modification system that are costly and suffer from a low
detection limit.

Many researchers used poly amino acid to modify
electrodes due
to their excellent electrocatalytic properties.15,16 For instance, poly(l-arginine) can be spontaneously electropolymerized
on the surface of electrodes for its significant outlook through the
coalescence of −NH2 and −COOH.17,18 It was reported that poly(l-arginine) improves the electrode
response stability and the analytes electroactivity.16

Inorganic nanoparticles incorporated with graphene
oxide (GO) were
reported to lead extraordinary function for electrode modification.19,20 Several other researchers observed the higher electrocatalytic performance
of the modified electrodes using polymers and reduced GO (rGO) composites.16,21 The free amine group of polyarginine (P-Arg) can spontaneously be
attracted to the carboxyl groups of GO. This provides an effective
method for the detection of biomolecules.22,23 Song et al. used copper nanoflowers (CuNFs) such as the nanostructured
electrode and observed excellent electrocatalytic activity in H2O2 sensing.24 Besides,
CuNFs were reported to efficiently increase the electron transfer
rate on the modified glassy carbon electrode (GCE) and used for glucose
sensing.25,26

In this paper, a novel one-step method
is proposed for the preparation
of CuNFs to incorporate with GO and jointly to be deposited on the
GCE electrode for sensitive detection of MEL. The electrocatalytic
activity of the bare and modified electrode is reported. Finally,
the proposed sensor is used to detect different concentrations of
MEL. Moreover, the commercial infant milk formula was analyzed with
the proposed electrode to study the practical potential of the sensor.

2 Materials and Methods
2.1 Chemicals and Materials
All purchased
chemicals were at their highest integrity. MEL, l-ascorbic
acid, l-arginine, and GO nanosheets were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich
(China) and were used without any further purification. Deionized
(DI) water was used for the preparation of all solutions. The phosphate
buffer solution (PBS) of 0.1 M was always used as an electrolyte solution,
and the desired pH (6.0) was maintained by using diluted HCl.

2.2 Synthesis of CuNFs
A single-step
hydrothermal method was used to synthesize CuNFs. At first, copper
acetate monohydrate (600 mg) was mixed with 15 mL distilled water
with vigorous stirring in a glass beaker. Separately, 1 g of polyvinylpyrrolidone
was mixed with 108 mg d(+)-glucose and dissolved in 30 mL
distilled water. Later, 1 M of sodium hydroxide solution was added
dropwise to the main solution and immediately transferred in a Teflon-lined
stainless-steel autoclave. The hydrothermal synthesis is conducted
in a furnace at 140 °C for 14 h under atmospheric pressure. Finally,
the residue was washed with distilled water/ethanol solutions for
three times and dried in an oven.

2.3 Preparation of the GCE/P-Arg/ErGO–CuNFs
Electrode
At first, GCE surfaces were polished with 0.05
μm of Al2O3 powder slurry on a polishing
pad and ultrasonically rinsed with DI water for 2 min to remove alumina
particles and other possible pollutants. The electrode was then washed
ultrasonically in ethanol for 2 min and was allowed to dry. After
careful polishing and washing, the electrode was immersed in 0.1 M
of PBS (pH 7.0), containing 2.5 mM of l-Arg solution. An
electrical potential ranging from −2.0 to 2.0 V (at 100 mV
s–1 for 15 cycles) was applied by cyclic voltammetry
(CV) for P-Arg deposition on GCE to obtain the GCE/P-Arg modified
electrode. After electropolymerization, the electrode was allowed
to dry in air. GO nanosheets were dissolved in PBS solution (1 mg
mL–1) and were then sonicated for 1 h. Later, 0.5
mg of freshly prepared CuNF powder was mixed with GO solution and
the mixture was sonicated for 15 min. The ErGO–CuNF film was
electrodeposited on the GCE/P-Arg electrode through cycling between
−1.4 and 0.7 V at 100 mV s–1 for 15 cycles.
The modified electrode was rinsed with DI water and dried carefully
and denoted as the GCE/P-Arg/ErGO–CuNF-modified electrode.

2.4 Apparatus and Instruments
The electrochemical
experiments were conducted in a three-electrode system using an electrochemical
analyzer (CorrTest CS300, Wuhan, China). A GCE as a working electrode,
silver/silver chloride (Ag/AgCl) as the reference electrode, and platinum
wire (Pt-wire) as a counter electrode was used throughout the system.
The morphology of nanomaterials was characterized by scanning electron
microscopy (SEM) using a Hitachi S-3000H model, and transmission electron
microscopy (TEM) was performed with the JEOL 2100 model.

2.5 Real Milk Sample Preparation
The
infant milk powder was purchased from a local market. At first, 0.1
g of milk powder and 0.25 g of NaCl were dissolved in 10 mL of ultrapure
water. Then, the obtained solution was ultrasonicated for 5 min and
heated for 10 min at 100 °C. After that, the solution was centrifuged
for 20 min at 4000 rpm and filtered using a filter paper. Finally,
the solution was sufficiently diluted for analysis.

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Morphological Characterization of CuNFs
The SEM and TEM measurements were performed to study the morphology
and structural features of as-synthesized CuNFs with different magnifications. Figure 1a represents the
uniform flower morphology of Cu nanoparticles with a diameter that
ranges from 300 to 600 nm. TEM and high-resolution TEM were carried
out, and the image is presented in Figure 1b. The uniform distribution of CuNFs is evidenced
by the low-magnification image shown in Figure 1a. The length of the nanoflower is ∼500
nm. The TEM image of a single nanostructure shown in Figure 1c reveals flower-like structures
of the Cu particles with size and shape that are consistent with the
observations obtained by the SEM images.

of P-Arg on the GCE electrode by CV in the potential range from −2.2
to 2.0 V at 100 mV s–1 for 20 cycles (d).

3.2 Electrodeposition of P-Arg and ErGO–CuNFs
CV was used for electrodeposition of P-Arg on the GCE electrode
at a potential range from −2.0 to 2.0 V with a scan rate of
100 mV s–1 for 15 cycles. Figure 2a shows the continuous deposition cycle of
the P-Arg layer on GCE. During high positive potential, the monomer l-arginine oxidizes which stimulates the polymerization on an
electrode surface and in an agreement with results that were reported
in an earlier study by our research group.22 The monomer of l-arginine can easily immobilize on the
face of the electrode by the formation of a covalent bond (C–N).
The electrodeposition of ErGO–CuNFs was performed by a series
of CV from −1.4 to 0.7 V (at 50 mV s–1 for
15 cycles), and GO–CuNF solution was dispersed in 0.1 M of
PBS (pH 7.0) solution. The reduction of oxygen functionalities in
GO can be observed from the first cycle with a large cathodic peak
appeared from −1.0 V.27,28 The electrodeposition
of the conductive film over the electrode was confirmed by the increase
in the peak currents with successive potential scans.29,30

electrode at a scan rate of 50 mV s–1 for 15 cycles.

3.3 Electrochemical Behavior of the P-Arg/ErGO–CuNF-Modified
GCE Electrode
The electrochemical characterization of the
bare and modified electrodes was performed via CV in 0.1 M L–1 of KCl including 5.0 mM L–1 of Fe(CN)63–/4– that is presented in Figure 3a,b. By looking at the figure,
it can be seen that the lowest peak current with a pair of well-defined
redox peaks was observed for bare GCE. The peak to peak separation
(ΔEp) value was calculated as 276
mV for the bare GCE electrode, whereas the cathodic peaks increased
with a ΔEp value of 197 mV after
ErGO–CuNF modification which facilitated the electrochemical
reaction of Fe(CN)63–/4–. It has
been previously reported that the electron transfer kinetics correlates
with the thickness of graphene film that can be easily control by
the deposition cycle using the electrodeposition technique.31,32 Moreover, CuNFs effectively facilitated fast electron transfer between
the modifying layer and GCE substrate because of its synergetic effect
with the ErGO film. The electrochemical active surface area (A) was calculated for both bare and modified electrodes
using Randles–Sevcik equation. For the bare and ErGO–CuNF-modified
electrode, the value of A was calculated 0.089 and 0.255 cm2, respectively, which proves the high electron transfer kinetics
of our proposed modified sensor.

scan rates (from inner to outer): 20, 30, 40, 50, 100, and 150 mV

5.0 mM L–1 of Fe(CN)63–/4– solution; (c) CV of the (i) bare GCE, (ii) GCE/P-Arg, and (iii)
GCE/P-Arg/ErGO–CuNF-modified electrode in 0.1 M of PBS (pH
6.0) containing 1 mM of AA with the addition of 1.0 × 10–8 M of MEL at a scan rate of 50 mV s–1.

Moreover, the relationship between peak current
with different
scan rates is also studied and presented in Figure 3b. It was observed that the peak current
gradually increases with the scan rate which suggests a diffusion-controlled
mass transfer phenomenon of the process. The CV method was used to
monitor the electrochemical behaviors of MEL at bare and different
modified sensors. It can be observed from Figure 3c that the proposed GCE/P-Arg/ErGO–CuNF-modified
electrode possesses the largest background current with remarkably
high potential separation between anodic and cathodic peaks.

3.4 Recognition and Mechanism of the MEL–Ascorbic
Acid Complex
As a recognition element, ascorbic acid (AA)
is used for MEL detection. For the quantitative analysis of MEL, the
anodic peak current of AA is qualified. Under the optimized experimental
states, when 1.0 × 10–3 M of AA was added in
0.1 M of PBS (pH 6.0), an elevated anodic current was observed as
shown in Figure 4b.
However, an effective decrease in anodic current was attained when
3.0 × 10–8 M of MEL was added into the prepared
solution because of the strong interaction between MEL and AA as shown
in Figure 4a. To form
a non-electroactive complex, a hydrogen bond was formed between the
hydroxyl group of AA and MEL. The peak current of AA decreases eventually
because the hydrogen bonding limits the ability of the oxidation of
the hydroxyl group.

Figure 4 (a) Mechanism of MEL–AA complex formation. (b)
DPV obtained
in 0.1 M of PBS (pH 6.0) containing 1 mM of AA with and without the
addition of 3.0 × 10–8 M of MEL at a scan rate
of 50 mV s–1.

It was assumed that the −NH2 of
MEL and the −OH
group of AA are subjected to form the MEL–AA complex. In −NH2 of MEL, the nitrogen atom contains four orbital directions.
The strong attraction of hydrogen atoms of AA and the nitrogen atoms
of MEL form a new orbit in MEL–AA. The hydrogen atoms in molecular
orbits can spontaneously move from the side of the molecular orbit.
The presence of a large amount of −NH2 and −OH
group in the MEL–AA complex makes the hydrogen bond stronger
and more adequate. The stable configuration of the complex is responsible
for the plane structure of MEL.33

3.5 Electrochemical Detection of MEL
Figure 5 shows the
differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) response of several MEL concentrations
in 0.1 M PBS (pH 6.0) with the addition of a constant amount of 1.0
× 10–3 M of AA. It was observed that the anodic
peak current decreases proportionally with increasing concentration
of MEL ranging from 10 × 10–9 to 9.0 ×
10–8 M. A favorable linear relationship can be accomplished
between the given MEL concentrations and the peak current. The linear
regression equation is y = −0.0363x + 5.3953 (R2 = 0.9743) with
a detection limit of 5.0 × 10–9 M. The obtained
detection limit (S/N: 3) demonstrated that the GCE/P-Arg/ErGO–CuNFs
sensor occupies a low detection limit and a broad linear concentration
range.

Figure 5 DPV’s obtained for the determination of MEL using the GCE/P-Arg/ErGO–CuNFs
electrode in a phosphate buffer (pH 6.0) at a scan rate of 50 mV s–1 with a wide range of concentrations that varies from
1.0 × 10–8 to 9.0 × 10–8 M (a). The calibration curves for the measured concentrations (b).

We have compared our results with other methods
for further investigation. Table 1 shows the properties
of the modified GCE/P-Arg/ErGO–CuNFs sensor which indicates
significant advantages including a low detection limit, acceptable
linear range, and high sensitivity comparing to the other methods.

3.6 Selectivity, Reproducibility, and Stability
Study
The selectivity of the developed sensor on the determination
of MEL was investigated. The results revealed that more than 200-fold
excess of Mg2+, K+, Ca2+, Cl–, SO42–, and NO3 had no any interference effect (<2%) to the determination of
MEL. The negligible variation in the measured current in the presence
of such interference clearly indicates the high selectivity of the
developed sensor toward MEL. To evaluate the reproducibility of the
proposed sensor, a series of CV measurements were carried out. For
a series of MEL measurements with the concentrations of 20 and 40
nM, the observed relative standard deviation (RSD) at n = 5 was 1.43 and 2.45%, respectively, which indicates excellent
reproducibility. The modified electrodes were maintained at 4 °C
for the stability test measurement, and the obtained peak current
for 20 μM of analyte solution did not show an obvious change
(lower than 5%).

3.7 Detection of MEL in Infant Milk Formula
A standard addition method was applied to the different portions
of a real milk sample separately spoiled with different concentrations
of MEL. A known amount of 4.0 × 10–8 and 8.0
× 10–8 M of MEL solution was added into 0.1
M of PBS (pH 6.0) and examined under optimum conditions. All samples
experienced two collateral measurements. The experimental results
are listed in Table 2 that suggests that the GCE/P-Arg/ErGO–CuNFs sensor occupies
good recovery that ranges from 87.76 to 90.43% and an excellent reproducibility.
Therefore, the modified GCE/P-Arg/ErGO–CuNFs electrode is considered
efficient and reliable for the MEL detection in the milk sample.

4 Conclusions
We have successfully developed
a simple GCE/P-Arg/ErGO–CuNF
electrochemical sensor for the detection of MEL. MEL is nonelectroactive
and its molecular structure is very stable. Thus, AA was used as a
recognition element for MEL detection. The anodic peak current of
AA was enabled for the quantitative analysis of MEL. We were able
to detect 5.0 × 10–9 M of MEL. The modified
GCE/P-Arg/ErGO–CuNFs sensor was also reusable, and the response
was reproducible. Therefore, this electrochemical sensor can be efficiently
employed for MEL determination in food samples.
