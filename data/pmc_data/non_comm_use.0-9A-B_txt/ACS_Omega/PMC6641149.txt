Catkin, a natural
hollow fiber, is used as a template to fabricate
light, flexible, and electrically conductive silver microtubes with
a high aspect ratio. The template is functionalized with tannic acid
(TA)–Fe coordination complexes. Because of the metal ion chelating
ability and reducibility of TA, silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs) can
be formed in situ on the fiber’s surface. The as-formed Ag
NPs can act as nucleation sites in subsequent electroless silver plating,
leading to the formation of a compact and uniform silver coating on
the microtube. The coating is constructed by densely packed Ag NPs
of only 15 ± 5 nm in diameter. Because of the tight accumulation
and small size of the Ag NPs, the resulting silver-coated microtubes,
without any post-treatment, show an electrical resistivity of 1500
mΩ·cm at a bulk density of 0.6 g·cm–3. We find that the in situ formed nucleation sites and the stirring
speed in the electroless plating play important roles in the formation
of a silver coating with a high electrical conductivity. This method
may be extended to fabricate conductive nanocoatings on other substrates.

1 Introduction
Owing
to their ideal conductivity and ability to adopt different
shapes,1 flexible conductive materials
have found applications in stretchable displays,2,3 sensors,4−6 electromagnetic shielding,7,8 antistatic,9,10 and so on. Generally, flexible conductive materials are made by
coating metallic layers on flexible substrates, such as polymer fibers,11,12 rubbers,13 and even biomaterials.4,14 Because of its ease of reduction,15 moderate
cost, and high electrical conductivity, silver is an ideal candidate
for use as a metal coating material. A variety of methods have been
reported for the synthesis of silver coatings on different substrates.
Among these methods, electroless plating11,12,16−18 is one of the most effective
because of its relatively low cost, simple equipment, and ability
to fabricate uniform coatings. Nevertheless, the large size of the
resultant nanoparticles (NPs) and the organic stabilizers capped on
the particle surface after electroless plating lead to high junction
resistance. To achieve high conductivity, post-treatments like thermal
sintering,7 electrical sintering,19 and microwave radiation20,21 are necessary.

Previously, we reported the fabrication of
conductive Ag NPs films
on various polydopamine-modified substrates and developed a simple
method to rapidly sinter Ag NPs in an electrolyte solution at room
temperature.16 However, the strategy has
disadvantages, e.g., the surface modification process is time-consuming
and dopamine is expensive. Tannic acid (TA) is a natural polyphenol
containing a central glucose core that is completely esterified with
gallic acid dimers (its molecular structure is shown in Figure S1). The abundant phenolic hydroxyl groups
endow TA with antioxidative and metal ion chelating abilities. TA
can also be used as a green reducing agent for fabricating noble metal
NPs because of its reducibility.22−24 Recently, Caruso et
al. reported a rapid and low-cost strategy for the preparation of
robust coatings on various substrates through the one-step assembly
of TA–Fe coordination complexes.25−27 Similar to polydopamine
chemistry, the strategy of using TA–Fe coordination complexes
has been applied to various surface modification processes.28,29

Willows (scientific name: Salix babylonica Linn.) are well-known woody plants widely distributed throughout
the northern hemisphere. They bear compact unisexual inflorescences
called catkins. Willow catkins possess unique characteristics, such
as having good flexibility and being fluffy and light. The main chemical
composition of the willow catkin is cellulose.37 Similar to other biological fibers, the surface of catkin
is hydrophobic because of the existence of a vegetable wax layer.
Removing the wax layer from the catkin surface can expose hydroxyl
groups and improve the catkin’s hydrophilicity. The surface
hydroxyl groups can form intermolecular hydrogen bonds with TA, which
is advantageous for anchoring TA–Fe coordination complexes
on the surface.38 Herein, we demonstrate
the preparation of light, flexible, and electrically conductive microtubes
using hollow catkin fibers as the template. The catkin surface was
modified by TA–Fe coordination complexes, and Ag NPs were formed
in situ on the surface as the nucleation sites for subsequent electroless
plating. We found that the nucleation sites and a high stirring speed
during electroless plating play important roles for the formation
of a dense silver coating constructed of small Ag NPs on the surface
of the fiber. The resultant microtubes show good conductivity even
without post-treatment. The procedure is simple and low-cost and may
be applied to various substrates for the formation of conductive silver
coatings.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Morphology
and Structure
The fabrication
process is schematically shown in Figure 1. The natural catkin fiber was first modified
by TA–Fe coordination complexes. The color of the fibers changed
from bright white to light blue. Because of the metal ion chelating
ability and reducibility of TA, the as-formed Catkins@TA–Fe
could bind Ag+ on the fiber’s surface in AgNO3 solution; then, the Ag+ is reduced to form Ag
NPs on the fiber. Because of the formation of the Ag NPs, the fibers
were pale brown. The in situ formed Ag NPs, which we termed the seed
layer, act as nucleation sites in subsequent electroless plating.
Finally, a compact Ag NP coating was formed on the fiber surface,
and silvery gray colored microtubes with obvious metallic luster were
obtained.

Figure 1 Schematic illustration of the synthesis of silver microtubes using
catkin fibers as the template. Photos show the color change of the
fibers during the preparation.

Figure 2 shows
the
change in morphology of the fibers during the modification. The pristine
catkin exhibits a microtubular structure with a diameter of 6–10
μm, a wall thickness of 0.5–1 μm, and a smooth
external surface (Figure 2a). After it is modified by TA–Fe, the outer surface
of the fiber becomes rough due to the formation of TA–Fe coordination
complexes (Figure 2b). The in situ formed Ag NPs on the Catkins@Ag NP seed layer have
an average diameter of about 70 nm (Figure 2c). As shown in Figure S2, the morphology of the Catkins@Ag NP seed is affected by
the reaction time. The quantity and particle size of the Ag NPs increased
with the reaction time. To ensure the formation of a uniform silver
coating in the subsequent step, the optimal time for the growth of
Ag NPs is 12 h. Figure 2d shows that a compact silver coating is formed on the fiber surface
after electroless plating. The silver coating is relatively smooth
and is composed of tiny Ag NPs densely packed to cover the fiber surface
completely. The diameter of the small Ag NPs on the final Catkins@Ag
microtubes is only 15 ± 5 nm. The morphology variation combined
with the color changes of the fibers suggested that a compact and
uniform silver coating was formed on the catkin surface.

Catkins@Ag NP seed layer, and (d) Catkins@Ag microtubes. Insets are
magnified images.

The change in composition
was confirmed by Raman (Figure 3a) and FT-IR (Figure 3b) spectra, further indicating
the successful surface modification of the fiber by TA–Fe.
In the Raman spectra, new characteristic peaks of Catkins@TA–Fe
at 1232, 1337, and 1479 cm–1 correspond to catechol
ring vibrations, indicating the presence of TA. The peak at 639 cm–1 is due to the bidentate chelation of Fe3+ by the phenolic oxygen of catechol, which has been used as an indicator
of the presence of TA–Fe coordination.30 In the FT-IR spectra, the peaks at 3380, 2890, and 1060 cm–1 correspond to OH, CH2 groups, and the C–O–C
bond from the glucosidic units, respectively, and they are characteristic
peaks of cellulose.39 The new peak of Catkins@TA–Fe
at 758 cm–1 corresponds to multisubstituted aromatic
rings in TA.31

spectra of catkins and Catkins@TA–Fe.

XPS results are displayed in Figure 4a. For both Catkins@TA–Fe and Catkins@Ag
NP
seed layer, the Fe 2p signal is detected. The high-resolution Fe 2p
spectrum of Catkins@TA–Fe shows a main peak at a binding energy
of about 711 eV with a 2p peak separation of about 14–16 eV,
confirming the presence of Fe3+ species and the formation
of TA–Fe coordination complexes on the fiber surface.27 The strong signals of Ag at 368 eV are detected
for both the Catkins@Ag NP seed layer and Catkins@Ag microtubes. In
the high-resolution of Ag 3d spectrum of Catkins@Ag microtubes, peaks
at 368 and 374 eV correspond to Ag 3d5/2 and Ag 3d3/2, respectively, confirming the presence of Ag in a metallic
state.11

Figure 4 (a) XPS spectra and (b) XRD patterns of
the various fibers.

XRD (Figure 4b)
was used to further investigate the crystalline structure. The original
catkins have diffraction peaks at approximately 15.0°, 17.0°,
and 22.5°, corresponding to the typical (11̅0), (110),
and (200) crystal planes of cellulose I.32 These peaks still appears in Catkins@TA–Fe and Catkins@Ag
NP seed layer. Along with the formation of the Ag NPs, new peaks appear
at 38.1°, 44.3°, 64.4°, and 77.4°, assigned to
the (111), (200), (220), and (311) crystal faces of face-centered
cubic (fcc) Ag (JCPDS no. 04-0783).29 The
XRD peaks of silver in Catkins@Ag microtubes are more intense, whereas
the diffraction peaks of cellulose I almost disappeared, implying
that the fiber surface was totally coated with a compact silver coating.

The obtained Catkins@Ag microtubes remain fluffy and exhibit a
smooth surface and hollow structure with a high aspect ratio (photo
in Figure 1 and SEM
images in Figure 5).
Typically, a microtube is about 1.7 mm in length, as shown in Figure 5a. The aspect ratio
is more than 170. From Figure 5c, it can be seen that Ag NPs are also formed on the inner
surface of the hollow fibers. According to thermogravimetric analysis,
the amount of Ag loading is determined to be 77 wt % from the differences
in weight loss (Figure S3). The thickness
of the silver coating is about 130 nm (Figure 5d). The composition of Catkins@Ag microtubes
was also surveyed by EDS. As shown in Figure 5e, C, O, and Ag are detected, and the intense
and uniform green color illustrates that abundant Ag is well-distributed
on the fiber surface. We also conducted UV–vis analysis of
Ag NPs from the various fibers in solution. As shown in Figure S5, the plasmon band of Ag NPs at 429
nm suggested the formation of a Ag NP seed layer. The blue shift in
the absorption peak to 407 nm after electroless silver plating is
consistent with the decrease in size of newly formed Ag NPs.40 In addition, the increase in the peak width
of the blue-shifted absorption peak might be ascribed to the superposition
of two peaks (429 and 407 nm), indicating the existence of both large
Ag seeds and small electroless plating-produced Ag NPs in the final
nanocoatings.

2.2 Electrically Conductive Properties
From the above-mentioned results, a uniform silver coating composed
of densely packed small Ag NPs was formed on the fiber surface. The
high aspect ratio of the microtube is benificial for constructing
conductive networks, and the densely packed small Ag NPs also help
to reduce the junction resistance between the nanoparticles. Interestingly,
the electric conductivity of the silver microtubes is good enough
for them to be applied as flexible and lightweight conductive materials
without any post-treatment.

As shown in Figure 6a, the obtained Catkins@Ag microtubes can
act as a part of an electrical circuit to light an LED when the required
voltage is supplied. Because of the fluffy nature of the prepared
microtubes, the electrical resistivity of the microtubes depends on
the bulk density of the samples, as shown in Figure 6b. The increase in the bulk density of Catkins@Ag
microtubes leads to an obvious decrease in the electrical resistivity.
The electrical resistivity does not decrease noticeably with a further
increase in the bulk density. This is because an increase in the bulk
density will result in more contact among the fibers; thus, more conductive
paths will be constructed. When the microtubes are compressed to a
certain degree, a nearly complete conductive network will be formed.
Further compression of the microtubes has no obvious effect on the
conductive path.

a conductor

and sintering on the electrical resistivity of the Catkins@Ag microtubes.

microscope photograph and (f) corresponding I–V curve of a single Catkins@Ag microtube.

Generally, post-treatments are necessary to achieve
high conductivity
after electroless plating.7,16 A dramatic decrease
in the electrical resistivity of the Ag coating will result since
the post-treatment helps to remove the organic stabilizer capped on
the Ag NPs and make the Ag NPs fuse to form a dense coating. For example,
a 4 orders of magnitude increase in the electrical conductivity has
been realized after sintering the Ag NP coating.16 Herein, the electrical resistivity is 1.5 × 103 mΩ·cm at a bulk density of 0.6 g·cm–3. After being sintered at 200 °C for 2 h, the morphology of
the silver coating does not show an obvious change (Figure 6c,d), and the electrical resistivity
decreases to 1.1 × 102 mΩ·cm at a bulk
density of 0.6 g·cm–3, showing only a 1 order
of magnitude change. The results indicate that the post-treatment
has a less dramatic effect on increasing the electrical conductivity
compared with that in previous studies.7,16 We also studied
the electrical conductivity of a single Catkins@Ag microtube. As shown
in Figure 6e, the two
ends of a single Catkins@Ag microtube were connected using a micromanipulator
6150 probe station. The corresponding I–V curve (Figure 6f) shows that the single microtube has excellent electrical
conductivity. The calculated electrical resistivity is about 0.7 mΩ·cm.

The electrical resistivity of Catkins@Ag microtubes and some other
conductive silver-plated materials reported are listed in Table 1. Obviously, the Ag
NPs that we prepared have a smaller size than those reported according
to the SEM images provided in the literature, even though accurate
data were not given. Using the pressing plate method, which is mentioned
in previous reports,11,33,34 the measured electrical resistivity of the microtube tablet was
as low as 0.33 mΩ·cm, showing a competitive electrical
conductivity. There are seveal reasons for the good electrical conductivity
of our samples. First, the diameter of the Ag NPs on the microtubes
is only approximately 15 ± 5 nm. The smaller the nanoparticles,
the larger the specific surface area, which is beneficial for the
mutual contact of the Ag NPs. Second, the small Ag NPs are densely
packed, resulting in a complete silver coating with fewer defects
on the fiber suface. Third, the thickness of the organic stabilizer
(in this case, gluconic acid) capped on the particle surface after
electroless plating is only 2 nm (Figure S4). Compared with our previous work, in which the capped stabilizer
was about 10 nm thick,16 the organic layer
is too thin to significantly impair the electrical conductivity of
the obtained silver coating.

2.3 Effect Factors on Morphologies
and Electrically
Conductive Properties
In this study, two factors are important
for the formation of a compact and uniform silver coating on the fiber
surface. First, the formation of the Ag NP seed layer is indispensable.
In the control experiment, Catkins@TA–Fe was directly treated
by electroless plating without the formation of the seed layer of
Ag NPs. The SEM images (Figure 7a,b) indicate the obtained Ag coating is incompact and nonuniform,
and the coating is also discontinuous with a poor adhesion to the
fiber. The electrical resistivity of the obtained samples increased
to 2.3 × 105 mΩ·cm at a bulk density of
0.6 g·cm–3, much higher than that of 1.5 ×
103 mΩ·cm for the Catkins@Ag microtubes mentioned
above. The significant differences in the morphology and conductivity
are due to the in situ formed Ag NPs being reduced by TA on the fiber
surface; these can act as nucleation sites, which are beneficial to
the growth of new Ag NPs in the subsequent electroless plating process.
The Ag NP seeds can concentrate Ag+ on the fiber surface,
thus facilitating heterogeneous nucleation and growth of the Ag NPs.
The Ag NPs formed during electroless plating tend to grow around the
seeds and eventually cover the whole surface. Therefore, the seed
layer of Ag NPs has an anchoring effect, which helps to form a continuous
and closely adhered silver coating.

Figure 7 (a, b) SEM images of silver-coated catkin
fibers directly prepared
by electroless plating without Ag NPs seeds. (c, d) SEM images of
silver-coated catkin fibers prepared by electroless plating under
slow stirring.

Second, the stirring
speed was another important factor that might
be easily neglected. We found that vigorous stirring (1200 rpm) could
prevent the aggregation of Ag NPs and help the Ag NPs to pack densely.
In a control experiment where the reaction was performed under slow
stirring (200 rpm), the SEM image in Figure 7c shows that lots of silver aggregates deposit
on the fiber surface loosely. The high-magnification image (Figure 7d) also exhibits
the appearance of large Ag particles on top of the silver coating.
The electrical resistivity of the obtained samples was 8.1 ×
104 mΩ·cm at a bulk density of 0.6 g·cm–3, 1 order of magnitude larger than that of the Catkins@Ag
microtubes. The high stirring speed can improve the diffusion conditions
to preserve a relatively stable concentration of Ag(NH3)2+, and the balance between nucleation and
growth of Ag NPs can be maintained; this is favorable for the formation
of a uniform and dense Ag NP coating.

3 Conclusions
In summary, a uniform and compact silver nanocoating constructed
by densely packed Ag NPs with an average diameter of about 15 ±
5 nm was prepared on a TA–Fe modified catkin fiber surface.
Reduction of Ag NP seeds by TA before electroless plating and a high
stirring speed are important for the formation of a dense silver coating.
The resulting silver-coated microtubes remained fluffy and lightweight,
have a hollow structure and high aspect ratio, and show good conductivity
without any post-treatment. This electroless plating strategy for
the fabricatation of a dense silver coating holds remarkable potential
in the field of light and flexible conductive materials.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials
Catkins
were collected
in Beijing, China. TA (ACS grade) and AgNO3 (ACS grade)
were purchased from Alfa Aesar. Phosphate buffered saline (PBS) solution
(pH 7.4) was obtained from Beijing Dingguo Changsheng Biotechnology
Co., Ltd. Glucose (99%) and FeCl3 (97%) were purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich. Aqua ammonia (25 wt %) and acetone were obtained
from Beijing Chemical Works. All of the chemicals were used as received
without further purification. Deionized water was used throughout.

4.2 Modification of Catkins
Catkins were
washed by ethanol to remove impurities and sonicated in acetone for
4 h to remove the vegetable wax. After that, the cakins were washed
several times with ethanol and water, followed by vacuum filtering
and drying in an oven at 60 °C for 10 h. The clean catkins (40
mg) were dispersed in TA aqueous solution (60 mL, 1.2 mg/mL). Then,
a FeCl3 aqueous solution (1.8 mL, 10 mg/mL) was added into
the suspension under vigorous stirring, with a sudden color change
from faint yellow to dark blue. After being stirred for 1 min, PBS
solution (60 mL, pH 7.4) was added to make the pH value of the reaction
solution around 7. Then, the suspension was vacuum filtered and cleaned
with water several times. The modified cakins, denoted Catkins@TA–Fe,
were collected and vacuum dried at 60 °C for 3 h. The color of
the fibers changed to light blue.

4.3 Preparation
of Catkins@Ag NP Seed Layer
Catkins@TA–Fe (30 mg)
was dispersed in a AgNO3 solution (50 mL, 0.9 wt %) and
stirred for 12 h. After that, the
suspension was vacuum filtered. The product was washed by water and
dried at 60 °C for 5 h. The color changed to pale brown, indicating
the formation of Ag NPs on the fiber surface.

4.4 Synthesis
of Catkins@Ag Microtubes
Dilute aqua ammonia (ca. 2 wt %)
was slowly dropped into a AgNO3 aqueous solution (20 mL,
1.7 wt %) under stirring until the
solution became transparent. Then, Catkins@Ag NP seed layer were added
into the solution, which was stirred for 2 min to form a uniform suspension.
After that, a glucose solution (2 mL, 2 wt %) was slowly (ca. 0.1
mL/min) added into the suspension under vigorous stirring (1200 rpm)
for 4 h. Finally, the precipitates were vacuum filtered, washed with
water, and dried under vacuum at 60 °C for 5 h. The final color
of the Catkins@Ag microtubes was silvery gray with obvious metallic
luster. The sintering of Catkins@Ag microtubes was performed in a
furnace at 200 °C for 2 h.

4.5 Measurement
of the Electrical Resistivity
The microtubes were uniformly
pressed in a tube to prepare the
specimen for electrical resisitivity measurements. By adjusting the
mass of products added, samples with different bulk densities were
prepared. The electrical resistance of the samples was measured to
calculate their electrical resistivity according to the following
equation: ρ = Rs/L, where
ρ is the electrical resistivity of the sample, R is the resistance value of the sample, and s and L are the cross-sectional area and length of the sample,
respectively. Otherwise, the microtubes were pressed into a tablet
using a tablet press under a pressure of 10 MPa.11,33,34 A four-point probe resistivity measurement
system (RTS-9, Guangzhou, China) was used to measure the electrical
resistivity of the tablets. All values were averaged over five individual
measurements.

For the electrical resistivity measurement of
a single Catkins@Ag microtube, water was used to disperse Catkins@Ag
microtubes. The suspension was dropped on a silicon plate and dried.
A micromanipulator 6150 probe station was used to connect the two
ends of a single microtube. Then, the I–V curve of the microtube was measured to calculate its electrical
resistivity according to the above-mentioned equation: ρ
= Rs/L.

4.6 Characterization
XPS measurements
were carried out with a Thermo Scientific ESCALab 250Xi using 200
W monochromated Al Kα radiation. Powder XRD tests were performed
on a Empyrean X-ray diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation. SEM
and EDS measurements were performed on a JSM-7500F (JEOL, Japan) field-emission
scanning electron microscope at an accelerating voltage of 5 kV. FT-IR
spectra were obtained on a BRUKER TENSOR 27 (KBr disk) FT-IR spectrophotometer.
Raman spectra were obtained on a DXR Raman microscope (Thermo Fisher
Scientific Inc.). UV–vis absorption spectra were measured on
a TU1901 spectrophotometer. I–V characteristics were measured using a Keithley 4200-SCS system and
a micromanipulator 6150 probe station under air. TGA was carried out
on a Q600 system (TA Instruments) at a heating rate of 10 °C/min
from 30 to 800 °C in a nitrogen atmosphere with a flow rate of
100 mL/min.
