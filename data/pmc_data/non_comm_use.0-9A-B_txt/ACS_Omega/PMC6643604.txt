Density functional
theory (DFT) is a widely used methodology for
the computation of molecular and electronic structure, and we confirm
that B3LYP and the high-level ab initio G3B3 method are in excellent
agreement for the lowest-energy isomers of the 16 glucose epimers.
Density-functional tight-binding (DFTB) is an approximate version
of DFT with typically comparable accuracy that is 2 to 3 orders of
magnitude faster, therefore generally very suitable for processing
large numbers of complex structures. Conformational isomerism in sugars
is well known to give rise to a large number of isomer structures.
On the basis of a comprehensive study of glucose epimers in vacuo
and aqueous solution, we found that the performance of DFTB is on
par to B3LYP in terms of geometrical parameters excluding hydrogen
bonds and isomer energies. However, DFTB underestimates both hydrogen
bonding interactions as well as torsional barriers associated with
rotations of the hydroxy groups, resulting in a counterintuitive overemphasis
of hydrogen bonding in both gas phase as well as in water. Although
the associated root mean squared deviation from B3LYP within epimer
isomer groups is only on the order of 1 kcal/mol, this deviation affects
the correct assignment of major isomer ordering, which span less than
10 kcal/mol. Both second- as well as third-order DFTB methods are
exhibiting similar deviations from B3LYP. Even after the inclusion
of empirical dispersion corrections in vacuum, these deviations remain
for a large majority of isomer energies and geometries when compared
to dispersion-corrected B3LYP.

1 Introduction
For
over a century, scientists have long been intrigued by the
isomeric and structural complexity in carbohydrates.1,2 With a wide range of possible molecular configurations for even
the simplest of sugars, there has been enormous interest by the community
in examining the highly configurable nature of saccharides as subtle
changes to its configuration can result in significantly different
properties. The conformational flexibility also complicates our attempts
to capture and describe the equally subtle intramolecular interactions
and hyperconjugation effects that are often cooperative in nature.3 Two commonly studied monomer units, the five-membered
cyclic aldofuranoses and six-membered cyclic aldopyranoses, have been
investigated extensively in numerous experimental and theoretical
publications for their conformation, ranging from microwave, rotational,
and NMR spectroscopy studies3−5 to classical molecular mechanics
(MM),6−8 semiempirical methods,9−11 density functional theory
(DFT),12−15 and high level ab initio studies.16 Additionally,
hybrid quantum-classical quantum mechanics QM/MM approaches have also
been employed to simulate enzyme kinetics in the hydrolysis of glycosidic
bonds in sugars.11

A relevant series
of studies conducted on the cyclic aldopyranoses
between 2004 and 2007 and a more recent study in 2012 on glycan analogs
have shown that DFT with the functional B3LYP17 and a 6-311++G(d,p) basis set are capable of reproducing or describing
experimental results, conformations, and geometries in vacuo.18−22 Furthermore, a DFT-based molecular dynamics study of glucose and
its epimers in aqueous solution, represented by the continuum COSMO
solvation model,23 has reported anomeric
ratios close to experimental values.24 Despite
such encouraging progress, the considerable cost of DFT when computing
even medium-size systems (i.e., hundreds of atoms) limits its use
for the studies of large sugar systems.25 When considering potentially larger, complex carbohydrate networks
such as cellulose or glycan, density-functional tight-binding (DFTB),
as a conceptual approximation to DFT that is roughly 2 to 3 orders
of magnitude faster than DFT, holds the promise of supplementing its
more costly counterpart at larger scales.26−28 Compared to
other semiempirical methods such as AM129 and PM3,30,31 DFTB has proven itself to be
both reasonably accurate—being able to reproduce different
sugar conformations alongside other biological systems,11,32−34 while remaining computationally efficient. Considering
the extensive use semiempirical methods in the QM/MM studies of DNA
and RNA sugars, it is vital for these approaches to correctly describe
sugar puckering profiles.35

As near-linear
scaled DFTB approaches such as the fragment molecular
orbital DFTB method36−38 and the divide-and-conquer DFTB method39,40 aims to push the limits of purely semiempirical quantum chemistry
methods by allowing the computation of macromolecules, a domain that
is traditionally under classical methodologies such as MM, it is essential
that their underlying methodology is sufficiently accurate to predict
structural and physiochemical properties in the systems they simulate.
For this reason, we provide here a comprehensive evaluation of glucose
epimers of the most stable conformations of d-aldopyranoses,
the 4C1d-aldopyranoses (Figure 1), using the standard second-order
DFTB, referred to as DFTB241 or SCC-DFTB,
and the standard third-order DFTB, or DFTB3.42 We assess the accuracy and characteristics of the semiempirical
approach against first-principles DFT by comparing optimized geometries
and relative electronic energies in both the gas and aqueous phase.
However, unlike previous DFTB benchmark studies that emphasized on
the puckering characteristics of the sugar ring,10,11,35 we further investigate the performance of
the DFTB2 and DFTB3 methods in terms of hydrogen bonding and torsional
potentials and find a complex relationship that affects the overall
isomer energetics via the molecular structure.

2 Computational Methodology
2.1 Quantum
Chemical Calculations
All
initial structures reported in this paper were obtained from ref (24) for both gas phase and
aqueous solution. All structures were visualized using the program
VMD.43 The programs GAMESS-US44 and Gaussian 09 and revisions D1 and E145 were used throughout the study for DFTB and
DFT calculations. The initial structures were first re-optimized using
GAMESS-US with the B3LYP functional with a 6-311++G(d,p) basis set
before performing any additional calculations. Single-point energy
calculations were performed from these geometries using the ab initio
G3B3, QCISD(T)/6-31G(d), MP2/6-311+G(2df,2p), and HF/6-311+G(2df,2p)
levels of theory in Gaussian 09 as well as two commonly used first-principles
DFT functionals, B3LYP and Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE)
with a 6-311++G(d,p) basis set in GAMESS-US. For brevity, the large
6-311+G(2df,2p) basis set will be denoted as G3Large in the remainder
of this paper. Additionally, single-point energy calculations were
also performed with DFT (B3LYP and PBE) with a STO-3G minimum basis
set for comparison with G3B3. For DFTB, single-point energy calculations
from B3LYP optimized geometries were carried out with DFTB2 and DFTB3
with the DFTB parameter sets mio-1-146 and 3ob-3-1,47 respectively.

All geometry optimizations started from the
same initial B3LYP/6-311++G(d,p) geometries and were carried out using
DFTB2/mio-1-1 and DFTB3/3ob-3-1
for DFTB. The convergence criteria for optimization were set to 2
× 10–6 au for the gradient. Calculations in
aqueous solution were carried out using the conductor-like polarized
continuum model, or C-PCM,48,49 as implemented in GAMESS-US,
with a very high tesserae density of 960 for all implicit solvent
calculations and a tight cavity in Gaussian 09. All structures were
confirmed as local minima by carrying out frequency calculations to
ensure there were no imaginary frequencies.

2.2 Definitions
Used To Characterize Conformations
Owing to the large number
of possible conformations within the 4C1 ring
conformation, the study adopts the nomenclature
and notions also found in ref (24). Each structure is categorized by their respective epimer
shown in Figure S1 (in the Supporting Information) and denoted by one of two anomeric forms, α or β, depending
on the orientation of their anomeric site C1–O1 (axial or equatorial
with respect to the ring) as portrayed in Figure 2. The anomeric isomerism contributes two
types of conformations to the total number of possible isomers. The
rotation around the C5–C6 bond that constitutes the primary
alcohol structure allows for three distinct conformations to be adopted
on top of the anomeric designation, gauche–trans (gt), gauche–gauche
(gg), or trans–gauche (tg), with regards to the dihedral angle
of the hydroxymethyl group O5–C5–C6–O6 positioned
at >0°, ∼180°, <0°, respectively. The
rotation
of the C6–O6 bond that controls the orientation of the hydroxyl
group H–O6 produces an additional three conformations, gauche+
(g+), trans (t), or gauche– (g−), with regards to the
dihedral angle of C5–C6–O6–H positioned at >0°,
∼180°, <0°, respectively. The clockwise or counter-clockwise
orientation of secondary hydroxyl groups on C1, C2, C3, and C4 positions
are labeled as “c” or “r”, respectively,
with the label “0” used when the orientation is neither
“c” nor “r”. These degrees of freedom
contribute an additional 34 = 81 distinct conformations.
In total, there are 8 × 2 × 3 × 3 × 34 = 11 664 different possible conformations, following our
classification scheme. If non-4C1 ring isomers,
such as the energetically less favorable 1C4 chair isomers, and the even less favorable skewed and boat ring
conformations were considered, the number of isomers would be even
higher.

and the internal rotations of C5–C6 which would produce the
configurations gg, gt, and tg, respectively, and C6–O6 which
would produce the configurations g+, t, and g–, respectively.
The orientation of each hydroxyl group on C1, C2, C3, C4 is denoted
“c” in the clockwise direction, “r” in
the counterclockwise direction, or “0” for neither.

The number of previously optimized
structures from ref (24) are listed in Table S1, while the number
of optimized B3LYP/6-311++G(d,p),
DFTB2/mio-1-1, DFTB3/3ob-3-1 geometries
are listed in Table S2, taking into consideration
only cases where corresponding structures were found at all three
levels of theory. Comparisons between structures were carried out
using the root mean square deviation (RMSD) of atomic positions with
respect to B3LYP optimized structures in vacuum and B3LYP-PCM optimized
structures in implicit solvent. In the case of heavy atoms (defined
in this paper as non-hydrogen atoms such as carbon and oxygen) geometry
comparisons, only those with the same gg, gt, or tg conformations
as the reference B3LYP or B3LYP-PCM geometry were used. Likewise,
every (gg/gt/tg, g+/t/g–, c/0/r) isomer must be identical to
the reference B3LYP or B3LYP-PCM geometry when comparing all atoms,
including hydrogen.

3 Results and Discussion
Before discussing the benchmark results, we briefly review the
general understanding of glucose isomerism in the field. Aldohexoses
that commonly form in nature, glucose, followed in abundance by galactose
and mannose, are what we can refer to as “common” sugars.
All other five aldohexose epimers do not occur naturally and need
to be chemically synthesized. Interestingly, the talose epimer turns
out to be energetically lower than glucose in static theoretical calculations
both in vacuum and aqueous solution; however, its number of stable
low-energy conformations is relatively small when compared to glucose
or mannose.24 The anomeric isomerism of
glucose derivatives strongly depends on the epimer and the solvent
environment they are in. For example, d-mannose the experimental
preference is for the α anomer in aqueous solutions,50 whereas the β anomer of d-glucose
are usually preferred in water and α in dimethyl sulfoxide and
ionic liquids.51 Other rotational isomerism
such as hydroxyl rotations are usually not resolvable due to low energetic
barriers that can be easily overcome at room temperature, but can
be studied computationally.

The benchmark results from our study
will be presented as follows.
In Section 3.1, we
present a benchmark for a number of ab initio and first-principles
methodologies against highly accurate G3B352,53 energies based on B3LYP/6-311++G(d,p) geometries. In Section 3.2, we report
the comparison of DFTB optimized geometries, focusing only on the
molecular skeleton involving “heavy” elements, along
with epimer isomer energetics discussed in Section 3.3. To understand the differences between
DFTB and DFT isomer energies in terms of hydrogen bonding, we report
the details of molecular geometries including orientations of the
hydroxyl groups (all atom geometrical comparison) in Section 3.4. In Section 3.5, we elaborate on the relationship
between torsional potentials and hydrogen bonding for DFT and DFTB.
In recent years, empirical dispersion corrections have been widely
employed in the study of noncovalent interactions, and therefore we
assess their effect on energetics and geometries in Section 3.6, where we present results
for DFTB2-D3H4,54 DFTB3-D3(BJ),55 and B3LYP-D3(BJ)56 methods.

3.1 Ab Initio and First-Principles Single-Point
Isomer Energies
The G3B3 method has often been used as an
accurate ab initio model that is able to reproduce experimental data57−60 and employed as a theoretical reference for other high-level methods.61,62 In Figure 3, we define
ΔEisomer as the global relative
energy difference between the lowest G3B3 energy isomer of all α
and β conformations both in gas phase and water, β-talose,
and the lowest energy isomer of other α and β epimers,
comparing HF/G3Large, MP2/G3Large, QCISD(T,FC)/6-31G(d), B3LYP/6-311++G(d,p),
and PBE/6-311++G(d,p) levels of theory against G3B3 with B3LYP/6-311++G(d,p)
optimized geometries in vacuum and solutions.

Figure 3 Comparison of single-point
isomer energies, relative to the lowest
energy isomer of the most stable talose epimer in G3B3, (a) in vacuum
and (b) in implicit solvent.

Of the five ab initio and first-principles methods, MP2/G3Large
energies match G3B3 energies best, both in vacuum and in implicit
solvent, whereas HF/G3Large displays a severe mismatch. The latter
is attributable to the lack of electron correlation, which is known
to be important for the description of hydrogen bonded systems.63 DFT methods using an STO-3G minimum basis set
further deviates by up to ∼20 kcal/mol from the G3B3 isomer
energies (shown in Figure S2 in the Supporting Information). While both B3LYP and PBE are in relatively good
agreement with G3B3, B3LYP provides a much closer agreement. The excellent
performance of the B3LYP method for the description of sugar isomerism
has been discussed in previous publications.18−21 Therefore, we consider B3LYP/6-311++G(d,p)
as a reliable, computationally feasible method to benchmark the performance
of conventional DFTB.

3.2 Molecular Geometry Parameters
for Heavy Atoms
In Table 1, the
mean absolute deviation (MAD), RMSD, and maximum deviation (MAX) are
summarized for the heavy elements both in vacuum and in implicit water
solvent. Figure 4 shows
the RMSD distribution for DFTB-optimized heavy atom positions against
B3LYP reference geometries in both gas phase and aqueous solution
in form of a histogram using 0.05 Å (bins).

Figure 4 Distribution of geometries
according to RMSD of atomic position
values for structures, (a) in vacuum and (b) in implicit solvent (excluding
hydrogen).

RMSD	0.07	0.08	0.07	0.09	
MAX	0.17	0.18	0.22	0.33	
Superposing the heavy atoms of DFTB geometries to
B3LYP, DFTB2
performs better than DFTB3 overall in the optimization of geometries.
This tendency is particularly visible in solution with the DFTB3 population
tending toward higher RMSD atomic position values. However, both methods
reproduce geometries that are in very close agreement to B3LYP as
the majority of structures possess RMSD of atomic position below 0.10
Å. The average difference in bond lengths in the gas phase is
0.008 Å for DFTB2 (−0.009 Å for C–C bonds
and 0.026 Å for C–O bonds) and 0.010 Å for DFTB3
(0.012 Å for C–C bonds and 0.009 Å for C–O
bonds). Similarly, in implicit water, the average difference in bond
lengths is 0.009 Å for DFTB2-PCM (−0.009 Å for C–C
bonds and 0.026 Å for C–O bonds) and 0.010 Å for
DFTB3-PCM (0.011 Å for C–C bonds and 0.011 Å for
C–O bonds). We note that DFTB2 systematically shortens the
C–C bonds while elongating C–O bonds up to 0.026 Å
on average. On the other hand, DFTB3 consistently elongates bonds
by 0.010 Å except for the anomeric C–O bond (which is
in near perfect agreement). Because of error cancellation in DFTB2
C–C and C–O bond length differences, the average bond
length difference in DFTB2 and DFTB3 appears to be similar. However,
the bond length differences in C–C and C–O bonds are
much more systematic in DFTB3.

Nevertheless, when considering
DFTB in general, C–C and
C–O bonds only deviate from 0.01 to 0.03 Å when compared
to the more expensive B3LYP/6-311++G(d,p) geometries in both the gas
phase and in solvent, thus can be considered as excellent agreement
between the two methods when it comes to the core ring structure.
Given such small differences in bond lengths, other geometrical parameters
such as bond angles and dihedral angles of primary and secondary hydroxyl
oxygen atoms would play a heavier role in influencing the RMSD of
the atomic positions. This can be observed from geometries with higher
RMSD values as shown in Figure 5.

for oxygen and carbon, respectively) and DFTB (orange) structures.

3.3 Relative
Isomer Energy Performance
3.3.1 Single-Point Energies
A straightforward
analysis of DFTB energy performance can be obtained by comparing DFTB
single-point energies with DFT single-point energies at B3LYP geometries.
In this comparison, we also included PBE energies. Similar to Figure 3, we define ΔEisomer as global energy difference between the
lowest energy isomer, but with B3LYP energies instead of G3B3, for
both gas phase and water. Figure 6 shows the corresponding ΔE curves
for DFTB2, DFTB3, and PBE using the same reference global minimum
structure. From the single-point energies, it is immediately apparent
that the ΔE curves for the two DFTB methods
are in close agreement with one another, while the two DFT methods
exhibits a similar trend but with larger individual differences. Strikingly,
the lowest energy epimer in DFTB is not β-talose, but α-altrose
in the case of vacuum, with α-altrose and α-idose being
the two lowest energy epimers in solution. It needs to be emphasized
that the span of ΔE values between epimers
are similar for DFT and DFTB in the gas phase (∼5 kcal/mol),
while the range of ΔE in solution for DFTB
methods is wider than DFT (∼7 kcal/mol vs ∼5 kcal/mol).
Because of the similar energy windows, the energy difference between
the lowest α and β conformers in DFTB is similar to that
of B3LYP, up to a 2.5 kcal/mol deviation and the energy ordering between
anomeric isomers identical, with the only exceptions being talose
(all cases), idose (gas phase DFTB3 and both DFTB methods in solution),
and mannose (in solution, DFTB2). Therefore, the small differences
in isomer energy highlight that DFTB can be as accurate as other flavors
of DFT with a large basis set when considering anomers. Further evaluations
of DFTB and B3LYP can be achieved from analyzing anomeric populations
and ratios; however, that would require a larger number of conformations
(ideally, with all low energy conformations for each epimer) and therefore
is beyond what is presented in this paper.

DFTB and B3LYP single-point isomer
energies for each epimer relative to the lowest energy isomer of the
most stable talose epimer for B3LYP; (a) in vacuum and (b) in implicit
solvent.

We now introduce δEisomer values
to compare isomer energies within the α and β anomer groups
of a particular epimer, using the lowest energy isomer, identified
by B3LYP, as reference. In Table 2, we present the results for gas phase and for solution. Figure 7 graphically depicts
the correlation between B3LYP and DFTB δEisomer energies in gas phase (Figure 7a) and in solution (Figure 7b), where the ideal agreement with B3LYP
result in a slope of 1.0 and an intercept of 0.0.

The general scattering
of DFTB2 and DFTB3 against B3LYP δEisomer values, measured by the determination
of R2 coefficient of the linear regression,
is better in the gas phase than in solution. The scattering for DFTB2
is also slightly better for DFTB3, but DFTB3 generally outperforms
DFTB2, in terms of slope and intercept. The slopes for each linear
regression relation are all lower than 1, indicating a general tendency
by DFTB methods to underestimate the range of δEisomer values, whereas the intercepts are all positive,
signaling a systematic DFTB overestimation of the individual isomer
energies within their respective anomer groups. The gas phase intercepts
for the gas phase are only up to 0.1 kcal/mol whereas intercepts in
solution reach up to 0.8 kcal/mol. From Figure 7, we conclude that DFTB3 reproduces B3LYP
energetics slightly better than DFTB2 at the cost of greater data
point scattering and that adding PCM reduces the accuracy of the DFTB
energetics in solution, in terms of slopes, intercepts, and R2 values.

Table 2 reports
anomer group-resolved deviations from B3LYP energies in terms of MAD,
RMSD, MSD, and MAX. Surprisingly, these quantities do not show a significant
performance difference between gas and solution phase as shown in Figure 7 but reveal that
β anomer groups have slightly larger errors than the α
anomers. Overall, both methods show similar performance for isomer
energies with MAX values deviating at most 4.7 kcal/mol in vacuum
and 4.1 kcal/mol in implicit solvent, MADs around 1 kcal/mol, with
RMSD values around 1.3 kcal/mol or less. The low MAD and RMSD values
seem incongruent to the relatively low R2 values discussed above. This discrepancy can be explained by the
fact that R2 is a relative measure of deviation, whereas both MAD and RMSD are absolute measures of deviation. The absolute deviations of DFTB methods from
B3LYP are small, due to the fact that the δE values themselves are also small, up to 10 kcal/mol, hence MAX values
up to 4.7 kcal/mol will result in a relative large scatter. To further
deconvolute the data in Figure 7, we plot in Figure 8 the distribution of relative single-point energies for DFTB2
and DFTB3 in vacuum (Figure 8a) and in implicit solvent (Figure 8b). This analysis reveals that DFTB2 trends
toward negative deviations for δEisomer from B3LYP values, whereas DFTB3 trends toward positive deviations.

3.3.2 Optimized Energies
From single-point
energies, we transition to compare isomer energies after geometry
optimizations at their respective levels of theory, DFTB2, DFBT3,
and B3LYP. Analogous to the single-point energy comparisons shown
in Table 2, Table 3 lists MAD, RMSD,
MSD and MAX values for the optimized structures in gas phase and solution,
while Figure 9 graphically
shows the corresponding data and linear regression of δE with Figure 10 shows the distribution of relative energies for DFTB2 and
DFTB3-optimized geometries in vacuum (Figure 10a) and in implicit solvent (Figure 10b).

We note that only 322
structures were compared as opposed to 481
structures in the single-point isomer energy comparison discussed
above. Visual inspection of Figure 10a indicates that a large number of the energetically
high-lying isomers have “disappeared” due to non-existent
corresponding minima in the DFTB2/DFTB3, first for certain gg, gt,
or tg configuration when considering only heavy atoms, then for certain
hydroxyl rotations from the primary and secondary hydroxyl groups,
a phenomenon we will further discussed in Section 3.4. Thus, only 322 structures correspond
to identical minima structures in all three methods in the optimized
comparison.

The smaller number of data points available in this
comparison
have influenced the R2 determination coefficient
of the linear regressions, which are slightly “improved”
in solution (DFTB2: 0.56, DFTB3: 0.54) but reduced by about 0.05 in
gas phase (DFTB2: 0.71, DFTB3: 0.68). Despite these opposing trends,
the general scattering patterns of DFTB2 and DFTB3 methods around
B3LYP δEisomer values in the gas
phase are still better than in solution. The slope of the DFTB3 curve
still generally outperforms DFTB2, while the intercept in both methods
remains small in gas phase and dropped by about 0.4 kcal/mol in solution.
We conclude, as in the case of the single-point energy comparison,
that DFTB3 reproduces B3LYP energetics slightly better than DFTB2
at the cost of greater data point scattering. However, adding PCM
during geometry optimization now improves the accuracy of the DFTB
energetics in solution in terms of slopes, while R2 values for solution are still worse than those for the
gas phase.

Table 3 reports
anomer group-resolved information analogous to Table 2 for the single-point energy comparison.
The data in Table 3 show with similar deviations in the MAX the single-point comparison
(gas phase slightly better than in solution, DFTB3 slightly higher
than DFTB2), with β anomer groups providing larger errors than
α anomers. Consistent with our single-point energy comparison,
the data in Figure 10 reveal that DFTB2 trends toward negative deviations for δEisomer from B3LYP values, whereas DFTB3 trends
toward positive deviations.

In summary, Tables 2 and 3 provide insight
into the relative isomer
energetics for DFTB relative to B3LYP: (a) DFTB epimer energetics
performance for α conformations is notably better than for β
conformations, a trend that is particularly true in vacuum, but less
pronounced in implicit solvent, and (b) relative isomer energies in
implicit solvent are considerably less overestimated than in vacuum,
namely roughly 0.6 kcal/mol difference between gas phase and PCM MSDs.

3.4 Molecular Geometry Parameters for All Atoms
including Hydrogen
Analogous to the geometry analysis presented
in Section 3.2 for
nonhydrogen atoms, Figure 11 shows the RMSD distribution for DFTB-optimized atom positions
against B3LYP reference geometries in both gas phase and aqueous solution
in the form of a histogram, this time including hydrogen atoms. We
observe a significant decrease in the population of the smallest RMSD
values due to “incompatible” geometries between B3LYP
and DFTB. As mentioned in Section 3.2, changes in the torsional angles associated with oxygen
atoms on primary and secondary hydroxyl substituents contribute substantially
to the RMSD of atomic position. When including the differences between
DFTB and B3LYP average O–H and C–H bond lengths, the
changes in bond lengths in the gas phase and in solvent are negligible,
increasing only to ∼0.010 Å for DFTB2 (this includes 0.020
Å for O–H bonds and 0.025 Å for C–H bonds)
and ∼0.001 Å in DFTB3 (0.005 and 0.007 Å for O–H
bonds in gas and implicit water and 0.014 Å for C–H bonds
in both gas and implicit water). Nevertheless, the RMSD of atomic
position values with hydrogen atoms included are roughly doubled from
the heavy atom comparison, as apparent in Table 4, due to the internal rotations of the primary
and secondary hydroxyl groups. This increased difference in atom positions
can also be seen in Figure 12, although we note that the right-hand structure difference
is not considered in the RMSD value because of its incompatibility
between the B3LYP and DFTB structure according to the applied compatibility
criterion. We find that high values of atomic position RMSDs in compatible
structures greater than 0.20 Å originate largely from internal
hydroxyl rotation.

In vacuum, four apparent types of geometry changes can occur when
re-optimizing DFT structures with both DFTB methods, two commonly
found in gas phase and solution and one exclusively for each case.
The most common of these in gas phase, arbitrarily called type 1,
involve the re-orientation of the hydroxyl group attached to the anomeric
carbon C1 (see Figure 13a). This geometry change affects only β conformations, namely
the rotation of the equatorial hydroxyl group on carbon C2. Compared
to the near perpendicular orientation of the hydroxyl hydrogen with
respect to the plane of the ring in B3LYP, the orientation of the
C1 hydroxyl group in DFTB2 and DFTB3 is roughly parallel to the plane
of the ring. We find that, for this change to occur, both hydroxyl
groups on C1 and C2 must also be in their “r” configuration.
Type 2 (Figure 13b)
occurs when a “c” orientated axial hydroxyl group on
C1 (α conformer) re-orientates from pointing toward the equatorial
hydroxyl group on C2 in B3LYP to the axial hydroxyl group on C3 in
DFTB. Type 3 (Figure 13c) involves an “r” oriented, axial C2 hydroxyl group
or a “c” oriented, axial C4 hydroxyl group, where outward
pointing hydroxyl groups in B3LYP turn “inward” toward
the O5 oxygen of the ring structure, with all occurrences of this
type being observed only in α conformations.

Figure 13 Types of changes found
in DFTB optimization (a–c) in vacuum
and (d) in implicit solvent: (a) re-orientation of C1 hydroxyl group,
type 1, (b) re-orientation of C1 hydroxyl group from C2 to C3 hydroxyl
group, type 2, (c) re-orientation of C2 or C4 hydroxyl group, type
3, and (d) re-orientation of gg toward tg by internal C5–C6
rotation, type 4.

In solution, type 2
(and to a lesser extent type 1) changes can
also be found in compatible structures with RMSD of atomic position
values greater than 0.20 Å. However, the most prevalent changes
in aqueous solution involve the primary hydroxyl group and the C5–C6
bond, which we arbitrarily label as type 4. Although the geometry
remains as gg, the internal rotation of the C5–C6 bond rotates
gg toward tg as portrayed in Figure 13d. The question now arises whether such hydroxyl group
rotations in Figure 13 are related to differences between B3LYP and the DFTB methods in
the description of torsional potentials or of the hydrogen bonding.

3.5 Relationship between Torsional Potential and
Hydrogen Bonding
It has long been known that the semiempirical
DFTB methods exhibit deficiencies in the description of hydrogen bonding,64,65 a critical feature in carbohydrates. It is also known that DFTB
methods tend to underestimate torsional barriers,26,66 as do most pure DFT functionals. We therefore devised a series of
torsional potential energy calculations involving four different test
molecules, cyclohexanol with the hydroxyl group in both equatorial
and axial positions and 1,2- and 1,3-cyclohexanediol for equatorial
and axial hydrogen bonding, respectively. Cyclohexanol allows the
study of the OH torsions in the absence of hydrogen bonding and can
be used to extract the torsional potential contribution from OH rotations
breaking a hydrogen bond in the two relevant cyclohexanediols. Relaxed
torsional potential energy scans were computed for all four molecules
at the B3LYP/6-311++G(d,p) level of theory using Gaussian 09 to obtain
reference geometries along a single OH group rotation. These geometries
were then used in single-point energy calculations by GAMESS-US. These
rotations are shown in Figures S3 and S4 in the Supporting Information. The hydroxyl groups at each position
(the axial or equatorial position in cyclohexanol or the hydrogen
bond donor OH group in the cyclohexanediols) were rotated in 30°
increments up to 360°. Because the torsional potential in DFTB
is determined by the PBE functional,67 we
also computed a corresponding PBE potential energy scans with the
6-311++G(d,p) basis set for comparison.

3.5.1 Cyclohexanol
We first discuss the
energetics for single hydroxyl rotations in the cyclohexanol test
molecule for both axial and equatorial conformations. Figure 14 compares the corresponding
torsional potential energies between DFT and DFTB methods in the gas
phase (Figure 14a)
and in solution (Figure 14b). Compared to both B3LYP and PBE functionals, both DFTB
methods predict potential energy curves that are noticeably lower
between 60° and 300° for the axial conformation in both
vacuum and implicit solvent, with DFTB3 underestimating rotational
barriers even more strongly than DFTB2. These differences in solvent
are marginal at best, roughly −0.3 to −0.4 kcal/mol
with respect to B3LYP. The largest differences are observed in the
gas phase axial conformation around 180°, which converts the
DFT local minima into global DFTB energy minima, more so in DFTB3
than in DFTB2. In the equatorial conformation, these effects are less
noticeable, and here the global minimum only changes position to 180°
in DFTB3.

group, right: equatorial hydroxyl group.

3.5.2 1,2- and 1,3-Cyclohexanediols
We
now consider the case of hydroxyl rotation in the cyclohexanediols.
Starting with the optimized 1,2- and 1,3-cyclohexanediols geometries
possessing hydrogen-bonded hydroxyl groups, we performed potential
energy surface scans for the axial–axial, axial–equatorial,
and equatorial–equatorial hydrogen bond interactions. By rotating
the hydrogen bond donor away from the hydrogen bond acceptor, we obtained
potential energy curves for vacuum and implicit solvent shown in Figures 15 and 16, similar to those shown in Figure 14 for the cyclohexanol molecule. The resulting
potential energy curves are now a combination of both torsional potentials
and hydrogen bond interactions. In order to separate these two energy
contributions, we eliminate the hydrogen contribution by computing
single-point energies for the rotation of the hydrogen bond donor
OH group by replacing the acceptor OH group by a hydrogen atom at
a fixed distance of 1.1 Å from the carbon atom. The energy difference
between the hydrogen-bonded cyclohexanediols and the “non-hydrogen
bonded” cyclohexanes is then considered as the isolated hydrogen
bond energy. This isolated quantity is significantly smaller than
DFT in both DFTB methods, with a noticeable improvement for DFTB3
over DFTB2. This is similar to what was previously as reported by
Gaus et al. in 2011 when DFTB3 was first devised.42

and 1,3-cyclohexanediol in vacuum. (From left to right) The energies

(Bottom, d–f) Isolated hydrogen bond energy.

We notice considerable discrepancies between DFT
and DFTB in the
energetics of isolated hydrogen bond energies for both cyclohexanediols.
For all three isolated hydrogen bond interactions (Figures 15d–f and 16d–f), a second, local energy minimum can
always be seen in the DFT, a characteristic that is absent in DFTB.
This absence results in a smoothened isolated hydrogen bond energy
contribution with no additional stabilization besides the global minimum.
We attribute this incorrect behavior of both DFTB methods to the lack
of structural features in the deformation density, which is represented
only by point charges instead of a multipolar expansion as suggested
by Bodrog and Aradi.68

From our analysis
it appears that, in addition to the incorrect
global minimum of the DFTB hydroxyl torsional potentials, DFTB also
incorrectly smooths the hydrogen bond energy contributions to the
torsional potential energy curve. The combination of these features
results in an increased affinity for hydrogen bonds in DFTB, relative
to DFT. In comparing optimized DFTB structures which retained their
original B3LYP configuration, we found that the total number of hydrogen
bonds formed (up to 2.5 Å) in DFTB optimized geometries in both
vacuum and implicit solvent are considerably higher than in B3LYP
(537 vs 580 vs 573 for B3LYP, DFTB2, and DFTB3, respectively, and
453 vs 512 vs 510 for B3LYP-PCM, DFTB2-PCM, and DFTB3-PCM, respectively).
In addition, as shown in Figure S5, the
hydrogen bond distances found in both DFTB methods are noticeably
shorter than in DFT despite their lower energy contributions. This
trend is particularly true for the two shortest hydrogen bond interactions,
the axial–axial hydrogen bond and the axial–equatorial
hydrogen bond. Both distances are shortened by up to ∼0.15
Å in both DFTB methods. However, the distance of equatorial–equatorial
hydrogen bonds remains relatively the same, consistent with the smallest
DFTB deviations from DFT for this particular interaction.

The
behavior described above is counterintuitive, given the fact
that both DFTB flavors are known to underestimate hydrogen bonded
interactions. Although there is a lowering in torsional barriers for
DFTB in equatorially bounded hydroxyl groups, which supposedly increases
the chances of hydroxyl group rotations (i.e.—type 1 changes
seen in Figure 13a),
the overall energetics of DFTB torsional potentials in equatorially
bounded hydroxyl groups are still much closer to that of B3LYP when
compared to its axially bounded counterpart. As a result, the characteristics
of a rotating equatorially bounded hydroxyl groups in DFTB are similar
to that of an equatorially bounded hydroxyl groups in B3LYP, while
axially bounded hydroxyl groups in DFTB are more likely to rotate
relative to B3LYP. This rotation ultimately results in the changes
as illustrated in Figure 13b,c. While a study for the internal C5–C6 rotation
had not been explicitly analyzed for the changes found in Figure 13d, it is likely
such rotation are influenced by the lowered rotational barriers found
in DFTB, allowing rotation of the O6–H group to hydrogen bond
the adjacent O4.

3.6 Empirical Dispersion Corrections
on Glucose
and Its Epimers
Since the early 2000s, the importance of dispersion corrections for describing noncovalent
interactions, in particular hydrogen bonding interactions, has been
widely recognized.69−72 At very little cost, noncovalent dispersion can be treated efficiently
using the so-called “Grimme D3” empirical corrections.69,70 To analyze the effects of such dispersion corrections in the context
of our benchmark study, we first compare the ΔEisomer and δEisomer values
between B3LYP and B3LYP-D3(BJ),56 before
summarizing the effects for dispersion corrections on DFTB2 and DFTB3
energies and geometries in vacuum. For DFTB2-D3H4,54 the program Cuby73 was utilized
to compute D3H4 corrections, while B3LYP-D3(BJ) and DFTB3-D3(BJ)55 were computed directly within GAMESS-US. We
note that the D3(BJ) parameters are optimized individually for B3LYP
and DFTB3, and the effects are therefore not immediately transferrable.

3.6.1 Dispersion Effects on B3LYP Energies
When discussing
changes in isomer energies between epimers, ΔEisomer, the D3 correction reduces the MAX of
B3LYP from G3B3 by ∼0.3 kcal/mol, while MAD and RMSD values
remain essentially unchanged (Table S3 and Figure S6). Additionally, B3LYP isomer energies
in the same anomeric epimer group, δEisomer (Table S4 and Figure S7), show very little distinction between the two approaches.
While a more in-depth study with DFT and a higher level theory would
be needed to pinpoint the general differences between B3LYP and B3LYP-D3(BJ)
in sugars, the similarity between B3LYP and B3LYP-D3(BJ) energies
hints at a relatively minor role for dispersion in terms of energetics.
In carbohydrates, the primary noncovalent interaction comes in the
form of hydrogen bonding. Dispersion forces such as van der Waals
would likely play a more significant role at shorter distances, but
most intramolecular hydrogen bonds in the sugars investigated were
found to be fairly long (rHA > 2.0
Å),
even for the relatively strong axial–axial hydrogen bond interactions.
Thus, while dispersion effects are likely affecting the shorter axial–axial
hydrogen bond interactions the most, these subtle differences are
difficult to differentiate in this study.

3.6.2 Isomer
Energies
Similarly, when
using empirical dispersion correction to DFTB, these contributions
are also seen to have a relatively minor effect on both semiempirical
methods as shown in Figures 17 and 18 when compared to the single-point
analysis of Figure 7a of B3LYP energies.

Figure 17 Comparison of δEisomer between
DFT-D3 and DFTB-D3 from B3LYP/6-311++G(d,p) geometries.

Figure 18 Comparison of δEisomer between
DFT-D3 and DFTB-D3 from B3LYP/6-311++G(d,p) geometries.

A deeper analysis, however, does show dispersion
corrections have
a more significant impact in the max deviations of α-conformation
as shown in Table 5. Compared to β-conformers, which can only form axial–equatorial
and equatorial–equatorial hydrogen bonds, α-conformations
can form the relatively shorter and stronger axial–axial hydrogen
bonds. As mentioned previously with B3LYP-D3(BJ), although dispersion
plays a relatively minor contribution to energy, it likely affects
axial–axial hydrogen bonds the most. With a better description
of dispersion contributions, the underestimated hydrogen bonding interaction
from DFTB can be compensated by dispersion corrections as shown in Figure S8, where we derived torsional and hydrogen
bond contributions for DFTB2-D3H4 and DFTB3-D3(BJ) from our cyclohexanol
and cyclohexanediol model systems. Of the three interactions, dispersion
corrections have affected axial–axial hydrogen bond interactions
the most.

3.6.3 Optimized
Geometries
In analyzing
the optimized geometries including dispersion corrections, the effect
of B3LYP-D3(BJ) on geometries was similarly benign as those on energy.
B3LYP-D3(BJ) optimized structures were found to maintain most B3LYP
configurations in Figure S1 (including
hydrogen) with an MAD value of 0.02 Å in terms of RMSD of atomic
positions. For DFTB, the largest effects comes in the form of corrected
geometries from DFTB to B3LYP-like structures when compared to the
170 optimized configurations of Figure S2, in particular, DFTB2-D3H4.

When comparing an initial subset
of 16 optimized epimers from Figure 3 and a set of 21 anomers, α- and β-glucose
from Table S2, we found that geometries
from B3LYP-D3(BJ) and DFTB3-D3(BJ) were nearly identical to their
original B3LYP and DFTB3 structures (see Tables 6 and S5, and Figure S9).

A closer analysis of
DFTB2-D3H4 geometries (from the initial 37
optimized to the 170 structures of Table S2), allowed us to discovered inconsistencies found from DFTB2-D3H4
geometries when compared to standard DFTB2. As portrayed in Figure 19, DFTB2-D3H4 could
retain certain B3LYP structures by preventing the changes found in Figure 13a–c from
occurring. It was these geometric corrections that allowed DFTB2-D3H4
to have more geometries with RMSD of atomic position values below
0.10 Å than DFTB2, DFTB3, and DFTB3-D3(BJ) as shown in Figure S10. However, Figure 19 also illustrates that not all structures
were positively affected by D3H4 corrections, thus preventing the
overall RMSD of atomic position values found in Table S5 from going any lower. Surprisingly, despite their
lower RMSD values, the hydrogen bond distances with D3H4 were shortened
by ∼0.05 Å for axial–equatorial and equatorial–equatorial
hydrogen bonds and away from B3LYP hydrogen bond distances (see Figure S11).

4 Summary
and Conclusions
Isomerism in carbohydrates is an inherently
complex topic, and
the number of associated minimum energy structures represents a combinatorial
explosion problem requiring fast computational methods. In this contribution,
we benchmarked the performance of the computationally efficient second-
and third-order DFTB methods, namely DFTB2 and DFTB3, respectively,
for the eight hexose monosaccharide epimer molecular structures and
isomer energies in gas phase and solution against the B3LYP/6-311++G(d,p)
level of theory, because we established that it can essentially mimic
the isomer energetics within ∼1 kcal/mol accuracy of the high-level
ab initio G3B3 model chemistry. We used 255 and 226 optimized B3LYP
low-energy gas phase and solvated isomer geometries from a previous
study24 and re-optimized those structures
using the DFTB2/mio and DFTB3/3ob methods, employing the PCM method
for the implicit water solvation. About 234 gas phase and 221 solvated
structures retained their C and O conformations in all three methods,
with the missing isomers having different orientations of the primary
alcohol group, namely gg, gt, and tg conformations. The resulting
molecular geometry parameters are in excellent agreement with B3LYP,
deviating less than 0.1 Å in the RMSD of C and O atom positions
and the corresponding maximum deviations reaching only up to 0.33
Å for a negligible fraction of the isomers. When hydrogen atoms
are considered in the geometry comparison, only 170 gas phase and
152 solvated structures retained their conformations in all three
methods, indicating a considerable number of OH rotations during the
geometry optimization.

We found that the DFTB2 and DFTB3 lowest
epimer isomer energies
at B3LYP optimized geometries are remarkably similar to one another
but deviate by as much as 4 kcal/mol from the B3LYP isomer energies,
with a tendency toward underestimating the isomer energies when choosing
β-talose as global potential energy minimum. As a result, α-altrose
and α-idose are predicted as competing global minimum energy
structures for both DFTB2 and DFTB3 methods. For comparison, PBE deviates
from B3LYP isomer energetics only by up to about 2 kcal/mol, and retains β-talose
as global minimum. On the other hand, when considering relative isomer
energies within a single epimer using B3LYP geometries, DFTB RMSD
deviations from B3LYP/6-311++G(d,p) energies are not much larger than
1 kcal/mol at the B3LYP geometries, geometries and maximum energy
deviations (MAX) reach 4.6 kcal/mol, with α conformations being
slightly better described by the DFTB methods than the β conformations.
The linear regression slopes for the DFTB/B3LYP isomer energy correlation
range between 0.87 (DFTB3, gas phase) and 0.68 (DFTB2-PCM), indicating
a general tendency by DFTB methods to underestimate the range of isomer
energies, especially in solution. Associated R2 values are situated around 0.75 in the gas phase and 0.5
with PCM. The linear regression slopes improve upon DFTB optimizations,
but the R2 values are still not much improved
with 0.70 in the gas phase and 0.54 in water.

Contrasting the
excellent agreement of B3LYP and DFTB geometry
parameters for C and O atoms with the relatively poor correlation
of isomer energetics hints at altered hydrogen bonding patterns and
OH rotations in the DFTB geometries. Potential energy curves for a
single OH group around the C–O bond indicated that DFTB methods
tend to severely underestimate the rotational barriers against B3LYP
and even PBE, DFTB3 even more so than DFTB2. This is particularly
true for axial OH group rotations. A model system allowing the decomposition
of torsional barriers from hydrogen bond contribution indicates that
deficiencies in the torsional barriers are compensated by the formation
of new hydrogen bond interactions in the DFTB geometries, causing
the seemingly erratic isomer energy behavior of the DFTB methods.
Investigation of hydrogen bond distances between axial–axial,
axial–equatorial, and equatorial–equatorial OH groups
in optimized DFTB structures reflect this systematic deficiency.

Even though hydrogen bonds are dominated by electrostatic and polarization
interactions, we also considered the D3(BJ) and D3H4 empirical dispersion
corrections, which gave mixed results for DFTB. In the geometries
analyzed, corrections to some carbohydrate geometries and isomer energies
can be beneficial with D3H4, while D3(BJ) only have a marginal effect.
However, the effects D3H4 has on hydrogen bonding are negligible when
considering all DFTB2-D3H4 optimized geometries in vacuum.

In
conclusion, DFTB methods are capable of predicting heavy element
positions in sugar molecules in excellent agreement with B3LYP/6-311++G(d,p)
geometries at a small fraction of computational cost, but in their
present formulation fail to reproduce hydrogen bond patterns which
are accessible experimentally in neutron diffraction experiments,
and therefore show substantial deviations in isomer energetics, irrespective
of the use of dispersion corrections. Recognizing that the cooperativity
in hydrogen bonds in large carbohydrate systems plays a central role
in their overall characteristics and properties,74 future improvements of DFTB such as the inclusion of multipolar
density expansion68 are necessary for high-fidelity
DFTB studies (relative to DFT) of sugar conformations in large oligo-
and poly-saccharide molecules.
