Anti-CD25 antibodies were immobilized on polypropylene
(PP) nonwoven
fabrics to specifically remove mouse regulatory T cells (Tregs) from
mouse spleen cells. PP fibers were coated with peptide nanosheets,
which were prepared by self-assembling of a mixture of X-poly(sarcosine)-b-(l-Leu-Aib)6 (X: glycolic acid or
a phenylboronic acid) and Y-poly(sarcosine)-b-(d-Leu-Aib)6 (Y: glycolic acid or diazirine derivative).
Anti-CD25 antibodies were immobilized by covalent linking between
the sugar moiety of the antibody and the phenylboronic acid group
on the peptide nanosheet. The removal rate of mouse Tregs from the
mouse spleen cells was more than 95% only by passing the filters,
while the nonspecific removal rates of other cells were less than
15%. The coating of peptide nanosheets on PP fibers was very effective
to provide a suitable environment for the immobilized antibody to
interact with the counterpart cells while the coating suppressed nonspecific
adsorption of other cells.

1 Introduction
Regulatory T cells (Tregs)
are known to possess suppressive effects
on the immune system and play important roles, for example, in the
immune tolerance.1,2 The expression of the transcription
factor Foxp3 is an important cell marker on characterizing Tregs.3 Among several Treg subsets, there are accumulating
evidences that CD25+Foxp3+CD4+ Tregs
prevent the hosts from various diseases such as autoimmune diseases
and inflammatory diseases.2,4 In general, Foxp3 expression
is upregulated by the IL-2 signaling, and Tregs are activated by the
pathways via CD25, CTLA-4, and glucocorticoid-induced tumor necrosis
factor receptor (GITR), resulting in the suppression of the function
of antigen-presenting cells (APCs). Consequently, healthy cells and
tissues can survive to avoid the attacks of self-responsive antibodies
and effector T cells.2 On the contrary,
the reduction or suppression of Tregs leads to the onset of autoimmune
diseases due to the absence of negative feedback. On the other hand,
CD25+Foxp3+CD4+ Tregs are involved
in the growth of tumors due to their suppressive effects on the immune
responses.5 Tumor microenvironments are
full of various chemokines, which recruit the immune cells including
APC and cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL).6 To
the counterpart of it, chemokine CCL22, which is produced from tumor
cells, tumor-infiltrating macrophages, myeloid suppressor cells, or
dendritic cells, recruits Tregs expressing CCR4 into the tumor region.7 The recruited Tregs could suppress the cytotoxicity
of APC and CTL via the immunity checkpoint molecule of CTLA-4 expressed
on the surface of Tregs and further produce the inhibitory cytokines
(TGF-β and IL-10) and cytotoxic substances (perforin and granzyme),
resulting in the survival and growth of the cancer cells to lead severe
damage on the host. In this respect, the cancer therapy to reduce
the number of infiltrating Tregs to the tumor microenvironment has
attracted considerable attentions as well as the cancer therapy targeting
cytokines and immunity checkpoint molecules. Recently, the antihuman
CCR4 monoclonal antibody was reported to reduce the number of Tregs
and augmented NY-ESO-1-specific CD8+ T-cell responses in
an adult T-cell leukemia-lymphoma patient.8 An antihuman CCR4 monoclonal antibody, KW-0761, also depleted Tregs
from the tumor environment in a patient to evoke the cancer immune
response.9 Therefore, the removal of Tregs
in vivo can improve the response of the cancer therapies of chemotherapy
and immunotherapy using cytokines and monoclonal antibodies.

The apheresis therapy is a treatment by removing the cells or proteins
causing the disease. The therapy has already been applied for patients
suffering from hypercholesterolemia, leukemia, and inflammatory bowel
disease (IBD). In these cases, the nonwoven fabric filters were designed
suitably for eliminating low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and leukocytes
by the extracorporeally circulating process of the patient’s
blood. The removal of Tregs from septic patients using polymyxin B-immobilized
fiber (PMX-F) has also demonstrated to eliminate about 50% Tregs in
peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs).10 However, the specificity in Treg elimination was not high so that
the nonspecific removal of PBMCs caused the adverse effect of lowering
the immune response against foreign microbes.11

To improve the specificity of the removability by filters,
antibody
usage for the filter has been frequently examined. For example, the
selective adhesion of CD25+ cells was achieved by the anti-mCD25-IgG-immobilized
poly(ethylene) film and their recovery from the film was also successful.12 Especially in apheresis therapy, there are two
ways to achieve specific elimination. One is site-oriented immobilization
of antibodies onto the nonwoven fabric fiber surface. Some site-oriented
antibody immobilization methods were demonstrated that use phenylboronic
acid, which conjugates with the oligosaccharide moiety presented in
the Fc region of the antibody or the use of protein A, which specifically
binds to the Fc fragment of IgG.13,14 The other
way is the hydrophilic surface modification to suppress nonspecific
adsorption of other cells. Rafting the hydrophilic polymer as typified
by poly(vinylpyrrolidone) on the nonwoven fabric by the atomic transfer
radical polymerization (ATRP) method shows the suppression of bacterial
adhesion.15 However, the high polymerization
degree is needed to make the PP fiber surface hydrophilic enough to
suppress cell adhesion. It follows that the terminal of the polymer
chain may be covered by other hydrophilic polymer chains. Therefore,
there are some difficulties to establish a compatible hydrophilic
surface introducing site-oriented antibody immobilization to capture
target cells efficiently and having high densely hydrophilic polymer
chains to suppress nonspecific cell adhesion.

In this study,
the removal filter specific for Tregs is developed
by the nonwoven fabric immobilized with the anti-CD25 antibody. We
propose here a novel and very simple preparative method using peptide
nanosheets for the antibody-immobilized nonwoven fabric in an attempt
to suppress the nonspecific cell adhesion to the filter (Figure 1). Previously, we
have reported that an equimolar mixture of the poly(sarcosine)-b-(l-Leu-Aib)6 (Aib: 2-aminoisobutyric
acid) (SL, Figure 2) and poly(sarcosine)-b-(d-Leu-Aib)6 (SD) self-assembles into planar nanosheets.16 The thickness was about 10 nm, indicating the
interdigitated monolayer structure comprising the heterochiral helical
peptides. The surface density of poly(sarcosine) on the nanosheet
was so high that immune cells could not recognize a possible antigen
of poly(sarcosine) chains covering the nanosheet.17,18 Furthermore, the surfaces of molecular assemblies prepared from SL and SD were able to be functionalized with
thiol,19,20 adenine, and oligosaccharide21,18 by their introductions at the terminal of poly(sarcosine) chains.
Accordingly, the peptide nanosheets can be designed to have two faces,
one for the phenylboronic acid to connect to antibodies and the other
for the photoactivatable radical generator to react with PP fiber.
These functionalized peptide nanosheets are attainable for coating
of the PP fiber to exhibit compatibly site-oriented antibody immobilization
and suppression of nonspecific cell adhesion. Using a free-standing
nanosheet is advantageous in view of avoiding the difficulty of the
molecular assembly morphology change during the process of the surface
modification, which is inevitable for the current liposome-based surface
modification method.22 The specific removal
ratio of Tregs from mouse spleen cells through the filter was evaluated.

2 Results and Disscusion
2.1 Design of Antibody Orientation and Surface
Modification
The performance of apheresis filters carrying
antibodies, IgGs, to remove specific cells, for example, from peripheral
blood mononuclear cells, depends sensitively on the immobilization
method of antibodies that should be designed so as to avoid impairing
the binding ability of the immobilized antibodies and to suppress
nonspecific cell adhesions to filters. In general, the chemical immobilization
of antibodies occurs randomly to the functional groups in the antibody
due to the multiple available sites in it. Since IgG molecules are
glycoproteins having sugar units at the Fc region,23 the use of phenylboronic acid as a linker chromophore can
limit the reaction site in IgG molecules to cis-diol
of the sugar units, leading to the orientational control of the immobilized
IgG.13,24 We propose here a new method of coating
fibers with molecular assemblies, which prevent nonspecific cell adhesion
and introduce the functional group connecting with the antibody, taking
a nanosheet morphology as shown in Figure 1.

The photoactivatable 3-phenyl-3-(trifluoromethyl)-3H-diazirine moiety was introduced at the chain terminal
of SD (DSD) via the Cu-catalyzed azide alkyne
cycloaddition (CuAAC).25 The chain terminal
of SL was modified with phenylboronic acid (BSL)24,26,27 and also with
maleimide (MSL) to be linked to the antibody. SL was labeled by fluorescein (FSL) to evaluate the coating
rates of the peptide nanosheets onto the nonwoven fabric fibers by
a fluorescence microscope observation or fluorescence quantitative
measurement.

2.2 Preparation of Peptide Nanosheets
Various mixtures of l- and d-form amphiphilic polypeptides
of the ethanol solution were injected into Milli-Q water to form molecular assemblies
(Table 1). In most
cases, planar nanosheets were observed in accordance with the design
of the molecular assembly. However, an equimolar mixture of FSL and DSD generated vesicles as well as planar
sheets (entry 1, Figure 3a). The bulky fluorescein groups on one face of nanosheets may provide
the sheet with curvature to induce the morphology change from the
planar nanosheet to the vesicle. The content of FSL was
therefore reduced to 15% of the total amphiphilic polypeptides to
generate only planar nanosheets (entry 2, Figure 3b). Then, we check the morphology changes
in the increase of ethanol concentration, which let the nanosheets
infiltrate easily. The nanosheet sizes increased from approximately
800 nm in the absence of ethanol to approximately 1090 nm with 20%
ethanol in the dispersion medium. However, in the case of 20% ethanol,
large aggregates were formed, which were not observed in less ethanol
content. The planar sheets therefore were prepared in the presence
of 10% ethanol. Similarly, an equimolar mixture of heterochiral peptides
of MSL and DSD or BSL and DSD self-assembled into planar nanosheets with approximately
400 nm size, which grew into larger sheets with approximately 740
or 1300 nm in the presence of 10% ethanol (Table 1 and Figure 3).

heterochiral
combinations of amphiphilic polypeptides in Table 1. (a–k) TEM images correspond to the

2.3 Coating Nonwoven Fabric with Peptide Nanosheets
The nonwoven fabric was made hydrophilic by UV/O3 treatment.
The peptide nanosheets were prepared from a mixture of FSL and DSD in the presence of 10% ethanol (entry 4 in Table 1) and incubated with
nonwoven fabrics under irradiation of a Xe lamp. After washing the
fabric with Milli-Q water, fluorescence microscopy was carried out
to confirm the surface modification by peptide nanosheets. Fluorescently
modified fibers were observed, suggesting the fabrics were successfully
covered with peptide nanosheets (Figure 4). The surface of the nonwoven fabric fiber
was further analyzed with atomic force microscopy (AFM). Ten nanometer
height sheet structures were observed frequently with the fabrics
treated with peptide nanosheets (Figure 5c,d,f), while mechanically smooth surfaces
were observed with untreated nonwoven fabric and fabric treated with
UV/O3 (Figure 5a,b,e). These imbricated surfaces (Figure 5c,d) that indicate peptide nanosheets were
accumulated on the fabric surface while maintaining sheet morphologies.
Simultaneously, DMT-modulus mapping images are also consistent with
topological images (Figure 5g–j). Taken together, the peptide nanosheets densely
covered the fiber by the dense poly(sarcosine) layer. The amount of
the peptide nanosheets on the PP fibers was evaluated by measuring
dissociated FSL with dimethylformamide, which collapse
the interaction in self-assembly and make FSL drain off
from fiber. The coating ratios, which were calculated by dividing
the surface area of the peptide nanosheets on the fibers by the total
surface area of the fibers, drastically increased with the addition
of ethanol as we consider (Figure 6). In the presence of ethanol, the peptide nanosheets
became larger sizes and easier to infiltrate into the nonwoven PP
fabrics. The coating ratio was as high as about 250% with the addition
of 10% ethanol to Milli-Q water, which did not change so much with
repetitive photoreactions (Figure 6).

2.4 Immobilization of the Antibodies to the Peptide
Nanosheets on the Nonwoven Fiber
The PP nonwoven fabrics
were coated with peptide nanosheets containing MSL or BSL in the presence of 10% ethanol. In the former case, the
anti-CD25 antibody was processed by tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine
(TCEP) to generate thiol groups to react with maleimide groups on
the nanosheets. In the latter case, the fabrics with nanosheets were
only incubated with the anti-CD25 antibody to conjugate with phenylboronic
acid on the nanosheets. The immobilized amounts of anti-CD25 antibodies
were evaluated by ELISA using the anti-Fab antibody to be 0.9 and
3.6 μg per one filter coated by MSL and BSL nanosheets, respectively. In the latter case, the surface density
of the anti-CD25 antibody is calculated to be 1.9 mg/m2, which corresponds roughly to immobilization of one antibody in
130 nm2 area. As a reference experiment, the filter coated
with nanosheets (SL) without MSL and BSL was resulted in nearly no antibody immobilization (Figure 7). The amounts of
the immobilized antibody on the nonwoven fabrics did not increase
even when the immobilization reactions were repeated (Figure 7).

7 in Table 1, MSL, red bar), and SL/DSD (entry
11 in Table 1, SL, gray bar) after the repetitive reactions. n = 3.

2.5 Treg Removal from Mouse Spleen Cells
The nonwoven fabrics with a 6.8 mm diameter coated with MSL/DSD, BSL/DSD, and SL/DSD nanosheets (entries 7, 9, and 11 in Table 1, respectively) were incubated
and immobilized with anti-CD25 antibodies. Six nonwoven fabrics were
packed in a 1 mL Mobicols (MoBiTec) column (six filters coated with MSL nanosheets (M6), BSL nanosheets (B6), and SL nanosheets (S6) columns). The numbers of CD25+Foxp3+CD4+ Tcells and whole T cells except
Tregs, which were obtained from the mouse spleen, were counted and
measured by a flow cytometer before and after passage through the
columns, and the removal ratios were calculated (Figure 8a,b). The total number of T
cells in the whole spleen cells was 5.8 × 106 including
1.9 × 105 of Tregs. The B6 column removed 90% Tregs
while the M6 column showed 65% removal. Addition to the difference
of the immobilized antibody amount, the removal ratio difference may
be attributable to the binding ability of the immobilized antibody.
In the case of the B6 column, the whole antibody was connected to
the surface, but the M6 column possessed the antibody of the half
size due to the reductive reaction by TCEP. The SL column
reflecting the nonspecific adsorption of T cells and Tregs showed
the removal rate less than 10%. Notably, nonspecific removals of the
whole spleen cells were less than 50% of the highest, and the B6 column
was the best as low as 15%. The B6 column therefore specifically removed
Tregs.

or S6 column. (b) The removal ratios of Tregs (red bar) and T cells
(gray bar) through the column equipped with the nonwoven fabric immobilizing
anti-CD25 antibody (column B18, B9, B6, and column M6) and without
the antibody (column S6). Columns B18, B9, or B6 have 18, 9, or 6
nonwoven fabrics conjugated with an antibody via phenylboronic acid,
and column M6 have six nonwoven fabrics conjugated with an antibody
via the maleimide functional group. (n = 3 except
B18; n = 1). The statistical significance of differences
of the removal ratio was evaluated by the two-tailed Student t-test. p values: *p <
0.05, **p < 0.01, n.s. (nonsignificant), p ≥ 0.05. (c) The SEM pictures of nonwoven fabrics
before cell flow (pre) and first to ninth fabric of after flow of
the B9 column.

The removal rates of Tregs were evaluated by increasing
the numbers
of the PP nonwoven fabrics in the column from 6 (column B6) to 9 (column
B9) and 18 (column B18). With the increase of the fabric number, the
removal rate raised up to 95% (Figure 8b). Notably, the nonspecific removal of the T cells
remained as low as approximately 15% irrespective of the fabric number.
It may indicate that nonspecific adsorption occurs at flow channels
other than the nonwoven fabric. Each of the nine fabrics in the column
B9 after passage of the spleen cells was subjected to the scanning
electron microscopy (SEM) observation. The spleen cells were obviously
trapped by first to sixth nonwoven fabrics but were scarcely found
in the SEM images of seventh to ninth (Figure 8c). This observation also indicates that
nonspecific removal of the spleen cells was significantly suppressed
by the surface modification of the PP fibers with the peptide nanosheets
having anti-CD25 antibodies.

3 Conclusions
The specific removal of
Tregs from the mouse spleen cells was demonstrated
by using the nonwoven fabrics, which were immobilized with the anti-CD25
antibody via peptide nanosheets. With the surface coating by the peptide
nanosheets, the hydrophilic polymer brush suppresses nonspecific cell
adhesion and ready for antibody immobilization under the control of
the orientation. The removal rate of Tregs was as high as 95% while
keeping the nonspecific removal rate of the whole spleen cells less
than 15%. Since the nonspecific removal rate did not increase with
the fabric number equipped in the column, the specific removal rate
owing to the immobilized antibody is expected to satisfy the demanded
performance with increasing fabric number in the column without losing
the other cells. The highly specific removal of the target cell is
an essential demand for the sort of the apheresis equipment to suppress
severe adverse effects caused by undesired removal of essential cells
for patients.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 General Procedure
Anhydrous CH2Cl2, MeOH, and THF were purchased from Wako Pure
Chemical Industries, Ltd. Other chemicals were purchased from commercial
sources and used without further purification. Silica gel for column
chromatography was purchased from Nacalai Tesque (silica gel 60, spherical,
neutrality). Transmission electron micrographs (TEM) images were taken
using JEM-2000EX II or JEM-1400 (JEOL Ltd., Japan). Dynamic light
scattering (DLS) measurements were taken using an DLS-8000KS (Photal
Otsuka Electronics). Atomic force microscopy (AFM) images were obtained
using with MultiMode 8-HR (Bruker). TLC was carried out on silica
gel 60 F254 (Merck). NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker DPX400
spectrometer. HRMS (ESI-MS analysis) were obtained on an Exactive
Plus spectrometer (Thermo Fischer Scientific). MALDI-TOF mass spectra
were recorded on an Autoflex III plus (Bruker) spectrometer using
super-DHB or α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (CHCA) (Sigma-Aldrich)
as the matrix. Purification by silica gel column chromatography was
carried out by elution of a column with a stepwise gradient elution
procedure or using a CombiFlash Rf 75 system with a linear gradient
elution procedure on standard conditions. Chemical reactions were
monitored by TLC. The TLC plates were visualized by immersion in an
appropriate stain (5% w/w ninhydrin in ethanol) followed by heating.
The nonwoven fabric manufactured from PP (Asahi Kasei Corporation,
Japan) has 0.58 mm in thickness, 5.52 μm in average diameter,
and 0.81 m2/g in specific surface area.

4.2 Preparation of Peptide Assemblies
Each amphiphilic polypeptide in ethanol (1 mg/20 μL) was prepared
as stock solution. The appropriate mixture of the polypeptides solution
was injected to Milli-Q water, Milli-Q water containing 5% v/v ethanol,
Milli-Q water containing 10% v/v ethanol, or Milli-Q water containing
20% v/v ethanol and then kept stirring at 4 °C for 30 min.

4.3 Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM)
The dimension of the molecular assemblies was analyzed by TEM. A
drop of dispersion was mounted on a carbon-coated Cu grid and stained
negatively with 2% uranyl acetate, followed by suction of the excess
fluid with a filter paper. TEM images were obtained at an accelerating
voltage of 100 kV.

4.4 Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS)
The
hydrodynamic diameters of molecular assemblies were measured by DLS-8000KS
(Photal Otsuka Electronics) using the He–Ne laser at 25 °C
for DLS measurements.

4.5 Immobilization of the Nonwoven Fabric with
Peptide Nanosheet
PP nonwoven fabric was punched out to a
diameter of 6.8 mm and was treated with a UV/O3 hydrophilization
treatment apparatus for 8 min. The prepared peptide nanosheet dispersion
and the three hydrophilized nonwoven fabrics were placed in a 1.5
mL glass vial tube and stirred under reduced pressure with a vacuum
pump over 25 min. After degassing treatment, the mixture was irradiated
with ultraviolet light for 10 min with a xenon lamp light source under
stirring. After staying the immobilized nonwoven fabric for 20 min,
they were equipped with a Mobicol column (Mobitec) and washed with
6 mL of Milli-Q water with a peristaltic pump over 10 min. For repetitive
immobilization of the peptide nanosheet, the three immobilized nonwoven
fabrics were treated from the degassing process again.

4.6 Fluorescence Microscope Observation of the
Nonwoven Fabric Immobilized with the Peptide Nanosheet Bearing with
Fluorescein
After the immobilization of the nonwoven fabric
with the peptide nanosheet prepared from FSL/SL/DSD in the Milli-Q water containing 10% ethanol, the
prepared nonwoven fabric was observed with the fluorescence microscope
(Olympus BX51, Olympus). The untreated nonwoven fabric was also observed
as a control sample.

4.7 Atomoic Force Microscopy (AFM) Observation
of the Immobilized Nonwoven Fabric with the Peptide Nanosheet
After a fiber was pulled out the immobilized nonwoven fabric with
the peptide nanosheet, topological and DMT-modulus images of the nonwoven
fiber immobilized with peptide nanosheets were measured using with
a Multimode V controlled by NanoScope 8 (Bruker) in a peak force tapping
mode using the gold-coated silicon tip on the nitride lever (SCANASYST-Air-HR, k = 0.4 N/m, Bruker).

4.8 Determination of the Amount of Peptide Nanosheet
Immobilized the Nonwoven Fabric
One nonwoven fabric having
photochemically immobilized peptide nanosheets was placed in a 1.5
mL glass vial. DMF (1.0 mL) was added to the vial bottle. After gently
stirring for 30 min, the solution was diluted to five times by DMF
and measured the fluorescence emission at 445 nm for excited wavelength.
Furthermore, for preparing the calibration curves, the emission of FSL in DMF with appropriate concentration was measured. After
performing fluorescence measurements and preparing the calibration
curve, the amount of FSL in the nanosheet immobilized
on the nonwoven fabric was calculated by the calibration curve. From
the calculated amount of FSL, the number of amphiphilic
polypeptides on the nonwoven sheet was calculated. Considering the
area occupied by one molecule of FSL, SL, and DSD is ideally 1.96 nm2, the area occupied
by the peptide nanosheet was calculated. Finally, compared to the
surface area of nonwoven fabric characterized by BET measurement,
the coating ratio was calculated.

4.9 Immobilization of Anti-CD25 Antibody with
the Nonwoven Fabric via Maleimide on the Peptide Nanosheet
HEPES buffer solution (20 mM, pH 8.2, 500 μL), tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine
hydrochloride sodium (TCEP) solution (0.5 M, pH 7.0, 42 μL),
and antimouse CD25 antibody from rats (0.5 mg/mL, 120 μL, Affymetrix)
were mixed in a 1.5 mL vial bottle and were reacted at 37 °C
for 90 min. Three nonwoven fabric samples, which immobilized via maleimide
on the peptide nanosheet, were immersed and degassed at room temperature
for 90 min for the reaction of antibody with maleimide. After the
reaction, three nonwoven fabrics were equipped with a Mobicol column
(Mobitec Corporation) and then Milli-Q water (2 mL) was flowed by
a peristaltic pump over 3 min to remove unfixed antibody and buffer
solution.

4.10 Immobilization of Anti-CD25 Antibody with
the Nonwoven Fabric via Boronic Acid on the Peptide Nanosheet
Three nonwoven fabric samples, which immobilized via boronic acid
on the peptide nanosheet, were immersed in 20 mM HEPES buffer solution
(pH 8.2, 500 μL) containing antimouse CD25 antibody from rats
(0.5 mg / mL, 120 μL, Affymetrix). After gently stirring at
4 °C for 12 h, three nonwoven fabrics were equipped with a Mobicol
column (Mobitec Corporation) and then Milli-Q water (2 mL) was flowed
by a peristaltic pump over 3 min to remove unfixed antibody and buffer
solution.

4.11 Determination of the Amount of Anti-CD25
Antibody Conjugated with the Nonwoven Fabric
First, anti-rat
IgG F(ab′)2 fragment-specific antibody HRP conjugated
(1.0 mg/mL, 0.3 μL, Iwai), anti-rat IgG F(ab′)2 fragment specific antibody (1.7 mg/mL, 70.32 μL, Iswai), and
citrate phosphate buffer (CPB, 46.68 μL) were mixed to prepare
a secondary antibody solution. The nonwoven fabric samples conjugated
with the anti-CD25 antibody were incubated to the blocking buffer
(2% BSA in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), 300 μL for 30 min
at room temperature). After the blocking process, the nonwoven fabric
samples were added to CPB (90 μL) and secondary antibody solution
(10 μL), incubated for 30 min at room temperature, and washed
three times with PBS-T (PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20). To 1.0 mL
solution of o-phenylenediamine (OPD, 42.0 mg) in
CPB (14.0 mL), 35% aq. H2O2 (21 μL) was
added the nonwoven fabric samples in a 1.5 mL vial tube. After stirring
at room temperature for 25 min, 2 N H2SO4 (0.5
mL) was added to the vials and then OPD was determined by UV measurements
at 492 nm/reference at 620 nm. A calibration curve is prepared using
with secondary antibody solution and the amount of anti-CD25 antibody
immobilized on the nonwoven fabric is calculated.

4.12 Removal of Tregs in Spleen Cells through
the Nonwoven Fabric Filter Column
The cells in the 6–8
week BALB/C mouse spleen were collected and treated with 5 mL of red
blood cell lysis buffer (RBC buffer, Thermo Fisher Scientific) for
5 min. After centrifuging the mixture, cells were pelleted, resuspended
in PMRI 1640 medium, and then filtered through a 40 μm membrane
filter for removing debris. The cell suspension was diluted to contain
2 × 105 cells/5 mL with RPMI medium. Appropriate nonwoven
fabrics having a diameter of 6.8 mm were equipped in the 1 mL MoBiTec
column, and the column with the fabric was filled with saline (Otsuka
Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd). Five milliliters of prepared cell suspension
was flowed through the column at a flow rate of 12 mL/h. After flowing
the cell suspension, the amount of the cell suspension passed through
the column and the density of cells in the suspension for determining
the number of cells in the suspension. After replacing RPMI medium
to PBS containing 2% FBS buffer (FACS buffer), the cell suspension
after and before passed through the column was centrifuged of 300g at 4 °C for 5 min on the 96 well V-bottom plate and
stained at 4 °C in with FACS buffer containing Alexa Fluor 700-labeled
antimouse CD3 antibody, BV510-labeled CD8 antibody, BV711-labeled
CD4 antibody, PE-labeled CD25 antibody, and Fixible Viability Dye
eFlourTM 780 for 15 min. After washing with 200 μL of FACS buffer
(centrifugation under 300g at 4 °C for 5 min)
for two times, the calls on the plate fixed with Foxp3 stating buffer
(Thermo Fisher Scientific) at 4 °C for 1 h. After removing the
fixation buffer (centrifugation under 800g at 4 °C
for 3 min) and washing with 200 μL permeabilization buffer (Perm
buffer) (centrifugation under 800g at 4 °C for
2 min), the cells were stained with the PECy7-labeled Foxp3 antibody
in permeabilization buffer at 4 °C for 15 min. After washing
with 200 μL of permeabilization buffer (centrifugation under
800g at 4 °C for 2 min) for two times and resuspended
in FACS buffer, the cells were analyzed by a flow cytometer (BD LSRFORTESSA
X-20, BD Biosciences). The removal ratio was calculated as compared
to the number of cells before and after flowing through the column.

4.13 Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) Observation
of the Nonwoven Fabric after Filtering the Spleen Cells
After
lyophilizing the nonwoven fabric, the fabrics were examined by scanning
electron microscopy (VE-8800, Keyence, Japan) at 1.3–1.7 kV
and different magnifications. The samples were sputtered with Pd/Au
by an MSP-1S magnetron sputter for 90 s and mounted on the SEM stub
with electrical tape (3M, USA).
