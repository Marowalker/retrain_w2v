==== Body
A part of
the experimental section
was printed incorrectly and does not reflect the authors’ proof
corrections during the article processing. The corrected sentences
are shown below.

Dissociation of Inclusion Complexes
A typical experimental
procedure was as follows (run 2). A mixture of the inclusion complex
(40.0 mg) with DMSO (1.0 mL) was heated at 70 °C for 1 h with
stirring for dissolution. The resulting solution was poured into methanol
(50 mL) to precipitate amylose, which was isolated by filtration,
washed with methanol, and dried under reduced pressure (23.9 mg).
The filtrate was concentrated to obtain the guest copolymer (8.0 mg).

The Mn value of the dissociated amylose
was determined by UV–vis analysis of the complex with iodine.41,42 A standard iodine–iodide solution was first prepared
by dissolving potassium iodide (5.2 mg, 0.031 mmol) and iodine (5.2
mg, 0.020 mmol) in water (10 mL). The amylose sample (1.0 mg) was
dissolved in DMSO (0.20 mL) and the standard iodine–iodide
solution (1.0 mL) was added to the solution. The violet solution was
then characterized by UV–vis spectroscopy to determine the Mn value; λmax = 594.0 nm, Mn = 13250.

A mixture of the dissociated
guest copolymer (4.0 mg), acetic anhydride
(1.0 mL), and pyridine (1.0 mL) was stirred at room temperature overnight.
The reaction mixture was then poured into hexane (50 mL) to precipitate
the product, which was isolated by centrifugation and dried under
reduced pressure to give an acetyl-terminated copolymer (3.1 mg). 1H NMR (DMSO-d6) δ 4.14–4.27
(br, −CH2O(C=O)CH3 (terminal acetate methylene)). From the integrated ratio of this
signal to a methylene signal of PTHF block (−C–CH2CH2–C−) at δ 1.61 and a methyl
signal of the PMeOx block at δ 2.11, the DP values of PTHF and
PMeOx blocks were calculated to be 29.3 and 9.2, respectively.

Formation
of the Hydrogel
After a mixture of the inclusion
complex (25.0 mg) with methanol (30 mL) was ultrasonicated for 2 h
and centrifuged, the supernatant was decantated off. The paste-like
swollen material was soaked in water (30 mL) for 24 h to obtain the
hydrogel. The water content was calculated by weight difference between
the hydrogel and its lyophilized sample.
