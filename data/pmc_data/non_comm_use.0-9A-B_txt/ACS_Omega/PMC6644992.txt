Intrinsically
disordered proteins (IDPs) are important for signaling
and regulatory pathways. In contrast to folded proteins, they sample
a diverse conformational space. IDPs have residue ranges within a
sequence that have been referred to as molecular recognition features
(MoRFs). A MoRF can be viewed as contiguous residues exhibiting a
conformational disorder that become ordered upon binding to another
protein or ligand. In this work, we introduce a structural characterization
of MoRFs based on entropy and mutual information (MI). In this view,
a MoRF is a set of contiguous residues that exhibit a large entropy
(from rotameric residue sampling) and large MI, the latter indicating
a dependence among the residues’ rotameric sampling comprising
the MoRF. The methodology is first applied to a number of ubiquitin
ensembles that were obtained based on nuclear magnetic resonance experiments.
One is a denatured Ub ensemble that has a large entropy for various
unitSizes (number of contiguous residues) but essentially zero MI,
indicting no dependence among the residue rotamer sampling. Another
ensemble does exhibit extensive regions along the sequence where there
are MoRFs centered on nonsecondary structure regions. The MoRFs are
present for unitSizes 2–10. That a substantial number of MoRFs
are present in Ub strongly suggests a conformational selection mechanism
for this protein. Two additional ensembles for the cyclin-dependent
kinase inhibitor Sic1 and for the amyloid protein α-synuclein,
which have been shown to be IDPs, are also analyzed. Both exhibit
MoRF-like character.

1 Introduction
Although
folded proteins carry out enzymatic reactions, intrinsically
disordered proteins (IDPs) are key for the regulation of transcription
and translation and, more generally, for cell signaling.1−10 Protein–protein and protein–ligand interactions often
take place via a disorder-to-order transition, whereby an unstructured
free protein becomes structured by interaction with a partner protein
or ligand, forming a functional interface by a decrease in the interfacial
free energy. In a conformational selection mechanism, the presence
of special conformations of an IDP may be required to bind a partner
protein or ligand. In an induced fit mechanism, the IDP becomes structured
upon interaction with its binding partner.4,11−13 The timing and ordering, of what is in essence a
coupled binding and folding process, is crucial.3,14−18

An aspect of IDPs that has garnered attention is the identification
of limited-in-extent residue subsequences that exhibit some disorder,
before binding orders them. These regions of a sequence have been
termed as molecular recognition features (MoRFs) and short linear
peptide motifs,19 the latter more associated
with shorter subsequences that make contact with a binding partner.19−21 For specificity, we will use the MoRF terminology. An IDP can be
thought of as a MoRF subsequence interspersed within more rigid subsequences,
though the disorder can certainly extend over the entire sequence.

The most predictive work on MoRFs is based on a sequence without
account of structural information.6,21−24 For a given subsequence of a sequence, these methods use residue
properties such as hydrophobicity and charge and their distribution
in the subsequences to predict regions that are likely to be disordered.
Here, rather than predicting which subsequences are disordered, we
analyze conformational ensembles for a given sequence and, from that
information, assess whether various subsequences can be viewed as
MoRFs. This approach of course has the drawback that structural information
is much more limited than the number of sequences that are known,
but the structural information does allow for a more precise characterization
of the amount of order.

Obtaining conformational ensembles for
IDPs from both experiment
and computation is a difficult task. Various methodologies such as
nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and small-angle X-ray scattering
(SAXS) are currently the most employed methods;25−30 but these methods may suffer from under determination and often
rely on computer-generated ensembles31−36 to refine the NMR data or other data. From the computational perspective,
in principle, molecular dynamics (MD) can provide a sufficiently long
trajectory that samples from a Boltzmann equilibrium conformational
ensemble. However, as much as it is well-appreciated, MD on complex
systems, such as proteins, is limited by having to overcome barriers
in a rugged energy landscape.37,38 Furthermore, as with
any MD-based study, there is the caution of coming to conclusions
based on the particular force field used.39−42 Both issues are of particular
concern for IDP simulations.

In this work, we develop structure-based
methods to quantitate
the degree of order in subsequences of a given sequence. Do the residues
of the subsequence “randomly” sample, for each residue,
their possible conformations independently of the other residues,
or do they exhibit an internal order, whereby the conformation of
some residues determines that of other residues? If the latter, we
consider such a subsequence to be a MoRF. Conformational states will
be defined by backbone φ and ψ dihedral angles43−48 obtained for each residue from Ramachandran49 space sampling in an ensemble of conformers. Mutual information50 (MI), based on information entropy, will be
the metric that provides a quantitative measure of the dependence
between residue dihedral sampling of rotamers. In this view, a MoRF
is a unit of contiguous residues that has a relatively large Ramachandran
entropy and large MI, indicating that the residues of the MoRF are
sampling distinct rotamers but with a strong dependence among these
residues’ conformational sampling. The implication is that
there are distinct conformers being sampled, yet the populations of
these conformers are quite limited. Mechanistically, the presence
of MoRFs favors a conformational selection mechanism. On the other
hand, residues with a large entropy but small MI are essentially random
sampling conformations and will be classified as not-MoRF subsequences.

This structural approach to MoRFs is first applied to ubiquitin
(Ub). One role of Ub is protein degradation, accomplished by its ability
to recognize a variety of proteins.51−53 Conformations of Ub
have been studied by a number of groups.30,54−58 In an NMR residual dipolar coupling (RDC)-based study, Lange and
co-workers54 found that free Ub samples
an ensemble that includes conformations that are found when Ub interacts
with a large number of ligands. On the basis of this reasoning, they
suggested a conformational selection mechanism for Ub, as also concluded
by a number of other investigators from related ideas.55,57,58 Thus, it is of interest to explore
the MoRF content of Ub. Furthermore, as detailed below, a denatured
ensemble of free Ub is available56 and
this provides a “control” for our methodology. That
is, a denatured ensemble should mainly have not-MoRF subsequences,
that is, a large entropy but negligible MI.

Also considered
here are the C-terminal residues of Ub that are
much more disordered than the preceding residues. In polyubiquitylation,
the terminal glycine of Ub links to a lysine side chain of a target
protein or links to another Ub, providing a role for enhanced flexibility
of the C-terminus.59 The issue we address
is whether these “tail” residue conformations can be
classified into distinct high-population clusters that exhibit specific
structural patterns.

Two other proteins, the cyclin-dependent
kinase (CDK) inhibitor
Sic1 and the amyloid protein α-synuclein (αSyn), are also
analyzed for MoRF character. Both were investigated by NMR and SAXS
methodologies, and ensembles of conformers were generated. On the
basis of the generated structures, they sample a very diverse set
of conformers. Our analysis supports this conclusion.

The plan
of the remainder of this paper is as follows. Section 2 assesses the four
Ub ensembles that were nominally suitable to this study and shows
that two are appropriate for our purposes, having a sufficient diversity
of distinct, rotameric Ramachandran space conformations. Section 3 presents the Sic1
and αSyn analyses. Section 4 outlines the main conclusions of this study and some
pitfalls and prospects of a structural MoRF analysis. Section 5 describes our methodology.

2 Ub Results
2.1 The UB_ERIDU Ensemble
The NMR data
for this ensemble were obtained under denaturing conditions of 8 M
urea and pH 2.56 From the 1000 structures
given as pdb files, Rama(1) plots and MoRF data were evaluated as
outlined in the Computational Methods Section. The ensemble refinement of intrinsically disordered and unstructured
molecules (ERIDU) Rama(1) data are displayed in Figure 1. The pale blue color is Gly. Otherwise,
the residues are mainly sampling α (−90,–30),
β-PPII (−120,150), and αL (90,45). Because this
is a denatured ensemble, the sampling should be the most diverse among
the four Ub ensembles under consideration here.

Figure 1 Residue Ramachandran
plots for the UB_ERIDU-denatured ensemble
(by residue type). Gly is light blue. The other residue main populations
are in the α (−90,–30), β-PPII (−120,150),
and αL (90,45) regions.

From the Rama(1) data, the MI plots for various unitSizes
can be
obtained. Figure 2 displays
the results for the UB_ERIDU denatured ensemble. For the purposes
of a scale of values, note that a Rama(1) residue has entropy (measured
in dimensionless natural log units) for two-rotamer sampling over
a variety of rotamer probabilities p/(1 – p) of Hind(0.5/0.5) = 0.69; Hind(0.25/0.75) = 0.56; Hind(0.15/0.85)
= 0.42; and Hind(0.1/0.9) = 0.32. From the values of Hind, the sum
of the Rama(1) entropies over each two- and each four-neighbor residue
stretch, there is rotameric sampling in some or all of the residues
involved, but the corresponding MIs are negligible. When scaled to
the bounded values 0 ≤ MInormed(X;Y) ≤ 1, the values are all around zero. Thus, the
rotamer samplings of the two half units of a unit are independent.
This result is a good check on the methodology, as one would expect
a denatured ensemble to produce, for the various unitSizes, a large
entropy but negligible dependence among their parts.

Figure 2 UB_ERIDU ensemble entropy
and normed MI, Minormed, plots for unitSizes
two [Rama(2) space] and four [Rama(4) space]. Hind is the entropy
summed over, respectively, two and four contiguous residues in the
sequence. MInormed is the corresponding MI bound defined in eqs 5.5 and 5.6. It is clear from these plots that this ensemble is essentially
sampling “random” rotameric Ramachandran states, as
appropriate to a denatured ensemble.

2.2 UB_2K39 Ensemble
The UB_2K39 ensemble54 was obtained using microsecond NMR RDCs supplemented
by nuclear Overhauser effects (NOEs) data along with the CONCOORD32 program to generate 116 structures. As noted
by Lange et al., an intriguing result is that this apo Ub ensemble
spans the Ub conformations found by crystallography for 46 Ub complexes.
The longer time span of the experiment was suggested as the origin
of the diverse ensemble for free Ub.

The Dictionary of Protein
Secondary Structure (DSSP) secondary structure assignment60 for Ub (PDB 1UBQ) is given in Figure 3.

Figure 3 DSSP secondary structure assignment60 for Ub (PDB 1UBQ).

MI plots for unitSizes 2, 4, 8, and 10 are displayed in Figure 4. There are many
units whose MInormed values are essentially unity (complete dependence),
but not all have corresponding substantial entropy, as made quantitative
below. Thus, there are a limited number of MoRFs (large entropy and
large MInormed). Note that even as the unitSize increases to 10, there
are still quite a few MoRFs—the dependence between the two
halves of the unit is substantial and therefore the dependence spans
extended sets of contiguous residues. Units with a large entropy but
small MInormed values in contrast are those that are sampling rotameric
states but in an essentially independent fashion. These are classified
as not-MoRF units.

Figure 4 Values of the total entropy assuming independence of the
two half
units, X and Y, and the normalized
MI (0 ≤ MInormed(X;Y) ≤
1) for units of the indicated sizes. Those units with a large entropy
and large MI are the MoRFs and those with a large entropy but small
MI are the not-MoRFs. The plots indicate that there are MoRFs even
with increasing unitSize; dependence can extend over a number of contiguous
residues. The numbering of the plots is from the middle residue of
the unit, that is, for unitSize 10, the residue pointed to in the
residue numbering is the middle residue of the unit. For example,
the first unit, QIFVKTLTGK, starts at residue 6, which is the K in
the middle of this unit.

To make the term substantial entropy quantitative, the entropy
of each unit on a per residue basis, assuming each residues’
rotameric sampling is independent, is plotted in Figure 5. Candidate MoRFs have substantial
entropy per residue on the scale of ln(2) = 0.69 for four rotamers
with two 0.5 populations and ln(4) = 1.39 for four rotamers with an
equal population.

Figure 5 Total independent entropy  per residue of unit k for
unitSizes P = 2, 4, 8, and 10. High entropy is concentrated
in nonsecondary structure regions of the sequence, as defined in Figure 3.

Table 1 provides
an overview of some of the MoRFs and not-MoRFs that are present for
the different unitSizes, along with not-IDP ranges that do not sample
multirotameric conformations. Included are the residue ranges and
the secondary DSSP designations, as displayed in Figure 3

d The assignment
is on the following
line of the unit.

The above
categorization is in good agreement with the DSSP structural
classification of UB, as shown in Figure 3, where one associates the secondary structure
with more constrained and loop regions with the more fluctuating regions
of a sequence. It is also in good agreement with the NMR data. The
Lange et al. NMR experiment (their Figure 1C) provides regions of high root mean square
fluctuation (RMSF), as obtained in their ensemble refinement with
orientational restraints (EROS) ensemble and from the ligand-bound
Ub X-ray structures. The regions of large RMSF found that there are
approximately region 1 residues 5–15, region 2 residues 30–40,
region 3 residues 45–52, and tail residues. Comparison with Table 1 identifies MoRFs
in regions 1, 2, and 3, along with some not-MoRF contributions because
of our low-entropy cutoff. Thus, the agreement with the experimental
data regarding regions of high entropy is robust. What, of course,
cannot be assessed from RMSF measures alone, that only indicate independent
residue entropies, is the correlation among residues that lead to
the concept of a MoRF.

There are potential functional interpretations
of our categorization.
The MoRF that covers approximately residues T7–T12 corresponds
to the β1−β2 loop region (Figure 3) that is known to be a molecular recognition
region.54 The combination of large entropy
(Figure 5) and MI (Table 1), thus indicating
flexible but correlated residues, may be significant for molecular
recognition. The MoRF spanning Q40-L50 spans the hydrophobic patch
centered on I44. This Ub-binding domain54,55 shows maximal
contact with binding proteins.54 Lange
et al.54 note that there is large RMSF
in this domain that is correlated with many binding protein contacts.
The combination of large entropy and MI found in this region may enhance
the ability to bind partner proteins. The not-MoRF found around residues
65–74 that is mainly β-strand has a large entropy but
small MI. This region is peripheral to the hydrophobic patch.52,58 The partner proteins here have a different character, being mainly
α helical. Finally, the region spanning residues 20–40
that are α helical in the DSSP classification (Figure 3) has a small entropy that
defines not-IDP in our classification scheme.

The designation
of a unit as MoRF or not-MoRF of course has to
be made by picking a dividing value of entropy along with normed MI. Figure 5 displays independent
entropies per residue of the units and makes it clear that entropies
in the nonsecondary structure parts are comparable to what would be
expected for more than one rotamer sampling of individual residues.
Within these large entropy regions of the sequence, values of the
normed MI that are approaching unity provide a quantitative measure
to label as a MoRF. Tables of all MoRFs and not-MoRFs are given in
the Supporting Information (Tables 1–4)
for unitSizes 2, 4, 8, and 10, along with their definitions. Other
choices for the dividing lines between MoRFs and not-MoRFs lead to
some changes in the categorization.

2.3 UB_2K39
Tail (Residues 72–75) Conformations
The Ub backbone
is relatively rigid with the exception of the C
terminus extending over residues 72–76 with sequence RLRGG.
A visualization of the UB_2K39 ensemble of 116 structures is shown
in Figure 6.

Figure 6 Visualization
of the UB_2K39 ensemble. The C-terminus residues
72–76 displayed at the top of the figure clearly sample a great
variety of conformations.

A partitioning of the UB_2K39 ensemble into clusters in the
dihedral
space may reveal distinct conformations of these C-terminal residues.
Because our clustering scheme is based on the Rama(1) residue information,
the analysis can only be carried out on residues 72–75. The
last unitSize 8 second half-unit spans these residues. Its clustering
then partitions the 116 samples into various conformers. Some of the
high population clusters are displayed in Figure 7.

Figure 7 Structures for three distinct clusters. The
(φ, ψ)
angle centroids (in degrees) of residues 72–75 of the clusters
are top (79.37, −37.26), (−124.34, 154.15), −82.49,
121.84), (−122.16, 151.51); middle (−96.31, 174.92),
(−94.62, 153.77), (90.57, 122.87), (116.54, 156.99); bottom
(−73.97, −27.71), (−135.98, 149.98), (−112.62,
−35.68), (115.83, 157.81).

Visual examination of these clusters and the corresponding
values
of the cluster centroids of the φ and ψ dihedral angles
for residues 72–75, given in Figure 7 caption, show that the clustering algorithm
does a good job of resolving the Lange et al. ensemble into rather
distinct contributions. That there are distinct groups of conformations
found for these residues does suggest that there may be a conformational
selection mechanism in operation for this region of Ub.

3 Sic1 and αSyn Results
The entropies of the UB_2K39
ensemble show multirotamer sampling
but may not sample them as extensively as other IDP candidates. Two
proteins, Sic1 and αSyn, that have been shown to be IDPs where
conformational ensembles are available for our analysis do show, as
found below, larger entropy scales. Thus, it is of interest to consider
their MoRF characters.

3.1 Sic1
The CDK inhibitor
Sic1 has been
studied by NMR and found to be an IDP. It interacts with Cdc4, a subunit
of a Ub ligase, that aids in Sic1 degradation via a number of Sic1
phosphorylation sites. Experiments61,62 monitored
the chemical shifts and 15N relaxation rates, RDCs, paramagnetic
relaxation enhancement (PRE) distance restraints as well as SAXS spectra.
These data were combined with ENSEMBLE calculations61 to provide an ensemble of conformations. While small (43
samples), this ensemble encompasses a wide range of conformations,
from compact to extended, indicating a large diversity of backbone
dihedral angle sampling. As noted in Mittag et al.,61,62 the Sic1 ensemble, while characterized by great flexibility, still
maintains significant nonrandom character. From the point of view
of the current investigation, the large differences in the dihedral
sampling found, coupled with a small ensemble, suggest that the sampling
may correspond to a large entropy and substantial MI values. The phosphorylation
sites of Sic1 are Thr-2, Thr-5, Thr-33, Thr-45, Ser-69, Ser-76, and
Ser-80.

A plot of the Hind, the entropy of each unit
on a per residue basis for unitSize 4, assuming each residues’
rotameric sampling is independent, is shown in Figure 8. The scale of entropy per residue [four
rotamers with two 0.5 populations give ln(2) = 0.69 and four rotamers
with equal population gives ln(4) = 1.39] shown in the figure indicates
substantial rotamer sampling for each residue, when they are treated
as independent. The values are smaller or moderate around most of
the sites of phosphorylation. That may indicate more restrained sets
of rotameric sampling around these sites.

Figure 8 Total independent entropy  per residue of unit k for
unitSize 4. These entropies tend to be smaller around the phosphorylation
sites.

Figure 9 Values of the total entropy assuming independence
of the two half
units, X and Y, (top plot) and the
normalized MI (0 ≤ MInormed(X;Y) ≤ 1) (bottom plot) for unitSize 4. Units with large entropy
and MI are the MoRFs and those with large entropy but small MI are
the not-MoRFs. The plots indicate that there are MoRFs concentrated
around the phosphorylation sites. The numbering of the plots is from
the middle residue of the unit, here residue 3.

The unitSize 4 Hind values for the half-units and the corresponding
MI values are shown in Figure 9. The Hind values track the Hind values in Figure 8. Note that our definition
of Hind is the entropy of the half-units, here unitSize 2, whereas
Hind asserts that all residues in a unit are independent
samplings and so maximal possible entropy. The conclusion still remains
that the entropy around the phosphorylation sites is quite reduced.
The MI values support this assertion in that they are larger around
the sites of phosphorylation. Thus, these results are in agreement
with the conclusions of Mittag et al.61,62 regarding
robust conformational sampling but certainly not random coil-like
behavior. Furthermore, the above analysis suggests that the sampling
is more restrained around the sites of phosphorylation that interact
with the Cdc4 receptor.

3.2 α-Synuclein
αSyn is a
140 residue, strongly disordered IDP that can aggregate under physiological
conditions. Its abnormal aggregation is a hallmark of Parkinson’s
disease among other neurodegenerative diseases.63,64 Numerous experiments have shown that it is quite disordered,65−69 but when it interacts with a biological membrane, an N-terminal
region (residues 1–90) becomes more ordered, whereas the C-terminal
region (residues 90–140) remains disordered.64,70,71 A division of the sequence into membrane
recognition (residues 1–60), aggregation-prone (residues 60–95),
and intrinsically disordered (residues 95–140) subsequences
has been suggested.64 Without membrane
interaction, αSyn is overall disordered, as shown by a host
of NMR methodologies as well as SAXS.65−69 Although αSyn is strongly disordered, experiments
suggest that it still is not a random coil, with a propensity to have
enhanced β-polyproline II (PPII) and β sheet Ramachandran
plane sampling relative to random coils.64,67 Hydrodynamic and other measurements suggest that it has a smaller
radius of gyration than appropriate for a random coil.68,69,72 Interactions among residue ranges
in the C and N terminals and middle regions of the sequence have been
suggested as sources of subtle interactions that produce nonrandom
coil behavior.65−69

Before presenting the MoRF results, it is worth examining
the underlying properties of the ensemble that ultimately lead to
the MoRF/not-MoRF character. As noted in Section 5.3, the ensemble was constructed by use of
NMR PRE measurements as constraints on a high-temperature MD simulation.66 The PRE measurements introduce a number of spin
labels that, while picked to minimize structural perturbations, still
alter the native protein sampling, and the MD of course introduces
force field sampling issues that are especially significant for IDPs.39−42

One way to characterize the ensemble is via its propensity
to sample
different regions of the Ramachandran plane. Two definitions of the
Ramachandran plane sampling that are useful for IDPs (see e.g., Figure 1) are (1) α
(angles φ < 0 and ψ < 0), β sheet and PPII
(angles φ < 0 and ψ > 0), and Gly (angles φ
>
0 and ψ > 0). (2) Split of β sheet-PPII into PPII (angles
−100 < φ < 0 and ψ > 0) and β (φ
< −100 and ψ > 0). These definitions were made
on
the basis of a “dot” plot of the Ramachandran plane
populations of all residues similar to that shown in Figure 1 for Ub. They were chosen based
on the following observations: the PPII and β sheet occupations
are not very distinct so they can be combined. The α region
is less well-defined than that in Figure 1—instead of the characteristic downward
sloping of ψ versus φ, it is more spread out and does
not slope downward. The right side (φ > 0) occupation corresponds
mainly to glycine residue sampling.

On the basis of these Ramachandran
regions, Figure 10 displays two views of this sampling where
in both the cumulating fractions of the various regions of the Ramachandran
plane are presented. That is, for each residue, the ensemble-averaged
occupation fraction is obtained, and a running addition of their values
is evaluated. If there were a distinction between the N- and C-terminal
regions based on different Ramachandran plane occupation propensities,
then that would be evident in the plot. The plots show that there
is no distinction for this ensemble of conformers that can be discerned.

Figure 10 Cumulating
Ramachandran plane population fractions as a function
of the residue number. Left panel: α (angles φ < 0
and ψ < 0), β sheet-PPII (angles φ < 0 and
ψ > 0), and Gly (angles φ > 0 and ψ > 0).
Right
panel: split of β sheet-PPII into PPII (angles −100 <
φ < 0 and ψ > 0) and β (φ < −100
and ψ > 0).

The total (over all residues) fractional populations are
α
total = 0.213, PPII Total = 0.372, β total = 0.335, and GlyTotal
= 0.080, indicating strong bias toward PPII and β sheet regions
of the Ramachandran plane that can be taken as an excellent signature
of an IDP. These results are in good agreement with previous conclusions67 based on NMR and SAXS experiments and computational
methods that also construct ensembles. That work also finds enhanced
PPII sampling relative to random coil sampling distributed throughout
the sequence. Figure 10 shows that this enhancement is present in the aggregation-prone
subsequence (residues 60–95) that may nucleate aggregation
and β sheet formation, though there is no “excess”
enhancement in this region relative to the rest of the sequence.

Figure 11 displays
the total independent entropy  per residue of unit k for
unitSizes P = 8 and P = 12. The P = 16 result is quite similar to the P = 12 result. This entropy treats each residue as independent, sums
over all residues in the indicated unitSize, and normalizes the sum
with the number of residues. Note that for P = 12
and the residue 60 point in the plot, residues 60–71 are included
in Hk=60ind. The plots show a dramatic dependence
on the unit composition. In particular, there is a distinctive decrease
in the initial part of the aggregation-prone region. That indicates,
along with part of the C-terminal and N-terminal subsequences, that
the ensemble is very limited in sampling in these regions.

entropy  per residue of unit k for
unitSizes 8 and 12.

The summed half-unit
entropies, Hind, and normed MI, Minormed, are shown in Figure 12 for unitSizes
4 and 8. They show that the Minormed values are very
small for unitSize 4 and larger but still small for unitSize 8, in
spite of the relatively large unit entropies. Figure 13 plots Minormed for unitSizes
8, 12, and 16.

Figure 13 Normalized MI (0 ≤ MInormed(X;Y) ≤ 1) for unitSizes 8, 12, and
16.

Two features evident in Figures 12 and 13 are the increase of Minormed
and the “drop-out” (to zero) of Minormed
with increasing unitSize. To understand the origin
of these effects, note that the number of possible states, S, scales exponentially with unitSize N. Here, with four possible Ramachandran rotamers per residue, S ≈ 4N. Thus, as N increases, the probability of all samples of the ensemble
for a set of N residues falling into the same state
approaches unity, and then the entropy and all its functions are zero.
This effect leads to the drop out feature in Figure 13. There are more half-units with zero entropy
as the unitSize increases. Figure 12 shows that for some residue ranges, Hind is essentially half the value of other ranges, indicating
that one of the half-units entropy is zero. The number of such half-units
increases with N. These zero MI regions mirror the
independent entropy plots in Figure 11.

The normed MI never becomes unity, indicating
that on any scale
of the unitSizes investigated, the sampling of units never becomes
completely correlated; but the Minormed values that are not zero do
increase with unitSize. That reflects the definition of MI as the
difference between independent and dependent entropies, both of which
increase with increasing unitSize, and because the half-unit entropies
are not increasing as fast as this difference, the normed MI will
tend to increase.

The above analysis shows that the analyzed
ensemble is indeed highly
disordered. As long as there are units with sufficient sampling to
give large entropy values, their MI tends to be very small. Thus,
at this unit scale, αSyn can be classified as essentially not-MoRF.
As larger unitSizes are considered, when both half-units do still
have entropy, then the MI values show that they are MoRFs. Those residue
ranges for which the entropy falls to zero are then not-IDP. These
latter residue ranges are around 20 in the N-terminal, 70 in the aggregation-prone,
and 120 in the C-terminal regions. That the entropy in the aggregation
prone region is much reduced may be related to its oligomerization
capability by some specific geometric requirement. The entropy reduction
around residue 20 may be associated with the amphipathic helical character
of the N-terminal residues 1–25.63

4 Discussion
It is abundantly clear that
IDPs exhibit a residual order versus
random coil behavior.61,73−75 In a given
sequence, there may be varying degrees of order in the subsequences
that compose the sequence. The definition of conformations used here
relies on residues sampling at least two distinct rotamers in the
Rama(1) space and building a 2N residue subsequence
conformational space from the possible Rama(1) rotamers. The MoRF
definition in our work encapsulates the concept of a subsequence that
has a large entropy via residues sampling distinct, rotameric states,
yet because of the dependence among the sampled rotamers of the two
halves of a given unit, there is substantial MI. The MI definition
developed here is based on the statistical dependence between the
two half-units that comprise the unit in Rama(2N)
space—the 4N dimensional φ/ψ space
for a subsequence of 2N residues. It is amenable
to normalizing the extent of MI between different units and also between
units of different unitSizes.

Focusing on ensemble data and
analyzing units of varying sizes
provide a structural view of IDPs that can be related to function.
In particular, the conformational selection mechanism whereby a ligand
selects from a limited number of distinct protein conformations can
be explored by these methods. Different conformers of the MoRFs may
be suitable for different ligands. The limited number of conformers
sampled, as measured by MI, lends a specificity to the potential binding
of different ligands.

Obtaining a reliable conformational ensemble
is a difficult task,
but such ensembles do permit the testing of structure—function
hypotheses, much like X-ray structural data on enzymes lead to testable
reaction mechanism hypotheses. The combination of experimental and
simulation methods have provided some ensembles, and here we have
analyzed ensemble data for Ub, Sic1, and αSyn. For Ub, a Ramachandran
analysis [Rama(1)] of the residues found that, of the four ensembles,
two, 2KOX and UB_2LJ5, did not have sufficient rotamer sampling to
warrant our approach. Of the two that did, UB_ERIDU and UB_2K39, the
UB_ERIDU ensemble was generated under denaturing conditions. That
is very useful to validate our approach. Intuitively, a denatured
ensemble should have a large entropy but essentially no MI for all
unit sizes, as is found here.

The UB_2K39 ensemble data does,
in contrast, show that there are
MoRF units present for unitSizes 2–10. For unitSize 2, Table
S1 of the Supporting Information shows
16 units with MInormed > 0.4 and, of these, there are 8 that are
considered
as MoRFs as the entropy Hind > 0.4 is relatively large. There are
not-MoRF units, too, that is, with sufficient entropy but small MI.
For these units, there is rotamer sampling of the residues but the
sampling is relatively independent. Table 1 collects some of the residues that are MoRF
and not-MoRF. The secondary structure designations given there do
indicate that both MoRFs and not-MoRFs are concentrated in turn, bend,
β-strand, and unassigned regions of the sequence. As the unitSize
increases, one might anticipate a dropoff in the number of MoRFs,
but at least to unitSize 10, the dropoff is mild. For unitSize 10,
there are 4 MoRFs relative to 9 for the smaller unitSizes, whereas
correspondingly, the number of not-MoRFs increases with increasing
unitSize. For all unitSizes, the MoRF and not-MoRF units are concentrated
in the residue ranges 0–10 (β-strand and turn) and 32–60
(turns, β-strand, and no secondary structure assigned). The
tail region (no secondary structure) is strongly not-MoRF. These results
are in accordance with the DSSP secondary structure assignment of
Ub shown in Figure 3 as well as with the NMR RMSF data.

The Ub tail (residues 72–75)
result of small MI is in good
agreement with the Caliandro et al.58 analysis,
based on long (0.2 μs) MD simulations, where they find large
RMSDs of the tail residues. They note that these residues are involved
in molecular recognition. Figure 4 shows that the Lange et al. UB_2K39 ensemble also
implies large conformational fluctuations, as the entropy is the largest
here. Our cluster results do a good job of separating the UB_2K39
ensemble into rather distinct conformations, emphasizing that clustering
based on (1) backbone dihedrals and (2) using the product of individual
Rama(1) rotamers to cluster the Rama(4) conformations is an effective
strategy to produce sharp clusters. Note that the Rama(4) space is
already of quite high dimension (dimension = 16), arising from Rama(1)
φ/ψ and, for periodic dihedrals, clustering done in Fisher
space, as discussed in Section 2 Methods.

As a general conclusion, the analysis does
show that Ub exhibits
extensive regions where residue sampling of rotameric states is robust,
yet from the dependence between the half-units, the sampling is quite
restricted. These results agree with and amplify previous studies
of Ub. The Lange et al. (UB_2K39 ensemble) experimental design permitted
observations on the microsecond timescale that, as they show, led
to a more extensive exploration of configuration space reflected in
quite a few residues sampling multiple rotamers. They demonstrated
that the heterogeneity in their free Ub ensemble spans conformers
that occur in a number of Ub-ligand conformers obtained by crystallography.
As they note, it strongly suggests that a conformational selection
hypothesis is operative. Candotti et al.56 in their urea denatured ensemble (UB_ERIDU) find an ensemble best
characterized as random-coil-like. To reach this conclusion, they
used a statistical coil model of an unfolded protein with their measured
RDCs as restraints. That certainly will emphasize that the random
coil nature and our zero MI agree well with their conclusions.

Two other ensembles, for the CDK inhibitor Sic1 and for the amyloid
protein αSyn, were analyzed. Both are more IDP-like than the
UB_2K39 Ub ensemble. For Sic1, the NMR and computationally derived
ensemble61,62 display a wide range of conformational geometries
but was shown to have significant nonrandom character. The MoRF analysis
shows that the sequence has a large entropy and substantial MI values,
thus supporting this conclusion. Contrasting the entropy and MI values
around the phosphorylation sites and away from them suggest that the
phosphorylation sites are more structured, as might be required for
interaction with its receptor Cdc4. Comparing the scale of the entropy
of this Sic1 ensemble with that of Ub shows that it is larger, indicating
that, from this perspective, Sic1 is more IDP-like than Ub. The αSyn
ensemble presents another case where experiment has shown that the
IDP character is very strong but was argued to not be a random coil
based on smaller radius of gyration and enhanced PPII sampling in
the Ramachandran plane. The ensemble analyzed here does show enhanced
PPII and β sheet propensities but does not reveal significant
differences in them as a function of the sequence. Nevertheless, the
feature that the aggregation-prone region (residues 60–95)
has enhanced PPII and β sheet sampling is present. There is
a strong effect of lack of entropy in some regions that is reflected
in the not-MoRF character. This does occur in the N-terminal and the
aggregation-prone regions, the latter region a source of oligomerization
capability.

Some cautions are worth noting. First, our analysis
is predicated
on conformational entropy arising from distinct rotamer sampling in
the residue Rama(1) space. This is distinct from entropic contributions
from single rotamer populations that arise from the width of those
distributions. There is an entropic effect from those sources, too.
However, while entropy can be, with care, defined for continuous random
variables, it does not lend itself to concepts such as MI. Focusing
on different rotamer samplings, though, is well-suited to explore
the role of conformational sampling in proteins and amenable to a
MI approach. Second, the ensembles constructed using experimental
data along with computational restraints tend to be rather small;
they are minimal ensembles designed to fit the constraints. Thus,
for example, the Ub_2K39 ensemble has 116, the Sic1 43, and the αSyn
576 members. Clearly, it is risky to make more than qualitative conclusions
using a statistical approach from small ensembles. In particular,
as the number of residues in the units considered increases, the exponential
increase in the number of possible states shows that it is likely
to have only one populated state. Then, all entropic properties are
zero. Third, the division between MoRF, not-MoRF and not-IDP that
we introduce depends on their definitions that are based on the values
of unit entropy and MI. For example, for Ub unitSize 10 in the 41–54
region that is β-strand-turn-β-strand, there is, with
reference to Table 1, actually a continuous transition between more MoRF to more not-MoRF
behavior. With a larger ensemble and correspondingly better statistics,
the entropic properties of the units may become smoother.

Finally,
we speculate about whether some methods may lead to results
that suppress the presence of MoRFs, that is, experiments and analysis
methods where the obtained ensemble (1) does not display rotameric
sampling, leading to negligible entropy or (2) while sampling rotamers
miss the presence of MI. The methodology for the UB_2K39 ensemble
analysis uses CONCOORD32 that creates an
initial ensemble using geometric restraints based on structural data,
and this ensemble is refined by the long-time experimental data. Here,
one might anticipate that rotamers are well-sampled and dependencies
embodied in MoRFs are preserved. By contrast, methods that start from
a given X-ray structure and use simulated annealing55 (e.g., the UB_2KOX ensemble) may not be able to surmount
barriers and result in low entropy, sampling essentially one rotamer
in Rama(1) space. Other methods use (very) high-temperature MD to
generate initial conformers that are then experimentally constrained.61,65 Here, while there may be a large conformational entropy from the
high-temperature sampling, the dependencies may be suppressed in spite
of the imposition of experimental restraints.

5 Computational
Methods
5.1 Ub Data
Four NMR-based Ub ensembles
were analyzed for suitability for this study. These are referred to
as UB_2K39,54 UB_2KOX,55 UB_2LJ5,30 and UB_ERIDU.56 Details of how they were obtained are given
in the referenced articles. Briefly, UB_2K39 consists of 116 conformations
obtained by refinement of RDCs and NOEs of free Ub that spans up to
microsecond dynamics. UB_2KOX (UB_2LJ5) consist of 640 (160) conformations
obtained by ENSEMBLE MD34,61 restrained by NOEs
and RDCs. The UB_ERIDU ensemble consists of 1000 structures based
on NMR RDCs. It was generated by the ERIDU procedure57 that uses MD with a restraint penalty term that incorporates
a distance from the experimental RDC data to generate a data-restrained
ensemble. It was carried out on urea-denatured Ub.

For our purposes,
what is needed is for some substantial number of residues to sample
distinct rotameric states in the ensemble; for example, sampling the
α helical and PPII regions. For each of these four ensembles,
we first made Ramachandran “dot” plots of each residue
(Ub has 76 residues; for Ramachandran plot purposes, the first and
last residues are excluded). All four Ubs do show population mainly
in the PPII, β, α, αL, and what we will designate
as O regions. Examination of these Ramachandran plots for the UB_2KOX
and UB_2LJ5 ensembles only shows a few residues with rotameric sampling
in the Ramachandran space to the degree that would make our methods
appropriate. That is, for almost all residues, the Ramachandran space
occupation of the ensemble falls in only one of the above population
designations. Therefore, we will focus on the UB_ERIDU and UB_2K39
ensembles that exhibit multiple occupancies for most of the residues.

5.2 Sic1 Data
An ensemble for Sic1 consisting
of 43 conformers was obtained from NMR data. Experiments61,62 monitored chemical shifts and 15N relaxation rates,62 RDCs, and PRE distance restraints as well as
SAXS spectra. These data were combined with ENSEMBLE calculations61 to provide the conformational ensemble.

5.3 αSyn Data
An αSyn ensemble
with 576 members was obtained from the Protein Ensemble Database,76 entry PED9AAC. PRE NMR measurements were carried
out with an inserted cysteine residue.66 The measured distance restraints were incorporated as restraints
in a high-temperature MDs simulation to generate the conformers.

5.4 MoRF Definition from Entropy and MI
We
will refer to a subsequence formed from a contiguous set of 2N (N = 1, 2, ...) residues as a unit of
unitSize 2N.

Definitions:

MoRF: A unit
that has substantial total entropy and a strong dependence
(large MI) among the conformations that these residues sample.

Not-MoRF: A unit with a large entropy but a small MI value, thus
sampling rotameric states but in an essentially independent fashion.

Not-IDP: A unit with a small entropy and a small or large MI value.
Essentially one conformation is sampled.

To provide a well-posed
definition of MI and entropy, the state
space will be discretized. Conformational states are then defined
as the direct product of Ramachandran-discretized rotamer populations.
For notation, we define Rama(1) as the rotamer sampling of one residue
in Ramachandran (φ/ψ) dihedral space and Rama(N) for the rotameric sampling of N contiguous
residues. For example, dividing Rama(1) space into four discrete regions
produces, for N contiguous residues, a Rama(N) state space of dimension 4N.

To implement the MoRF definition, let X denote
an N-dimensional random variable and x = (x1,x2,...,xN)∈{X} a member of the set of possible (discrete) values {X} that it can take on. The corresponding (information) entropy50 is 5.1  

For random variables X and Y in
the 2N dimensional Ramachandran space, an information-entropy-based
MI MI(X;Y) can
be defined as 5.2  

This is a generalization of the usual MI definition50 to random variables that are composite, desired
here, as appropriate to a definition of a MoRF. Note that MI is a specialization of the Kullback–Liebler entropy77 because the denominator probability is an independent
probability versus some other arbitrary probability q(x,y). By definition 5.3  thus MI is the difference
between independent
and dependent entropies.

MI has the virtue (vs a correlation
coefficient) of quantitating
the amount of dependence of one random variable on another random
variable. The drawback is that when comparing MI for
different sets of variables, the varying entropy contributing to the
different MI makes comparison difficult. However,
it is straightforward to produce upper and lower bounds on each MI. Clearly, a lower bound is zero, achieved when the two
random variables are independent. An upper bound can be formulated50 5.4  with the special case that
if min(H(X),H(Y)) = 0, then MI(X;Y) = 0. The maximal entropy reduction from complete dependence
is
the smaller of the two entropies. For example, if H(Y) < H(X)
and there is the functional relation Y = f(X), then MI(X;Y) = H(Y) and H(X,Y) = H(X). No new statistical information is
available when there is a functional relation between Y and X. In general, it is worth noting that because MI(X;Y) ≥ 0, it
follows from MI(X;Y) = H(X) – H(X|Y), with H(X|Y) being the conditional entropy, that
conditioning (sensibly) reduces entropy; H(X|Y) ≤ H(X).

To put the MI of different MoRFs
on the same scale
it then is useful to define 5.5  that satisfies 5.6  

Then, comparing
the degrees of dependence between different MoRFs
is straightforward.

The MI definition in eq 5.2 is different from the conventional one, where
the comparison
is made with the independence of all random variables. The conventional
MI expression denoted as MIcon(X;Y) is 5.7  with pind(x,y) being the product of
the probabilities of
the 2N random variables. In the Supporting Information, we show that MI(X;Y)can be expressed in terms of MIcon(X;Y)
for X and Y ranging from 1 to N random variables. For MoRF comparison purposes, MIcon(X;Y)
is not as useful as the MI of eq 5.2 because normalizing it is not so straightforward.

5.5 Clustering Algorithm for MoRFs
Given
the ensemble data of a sequence’s backbone φ and ψ
dihedral angles, a classification into discrete rotamers for each
residue is required. This classification is carried out in the Rama(1)
space—the φ/ψ dihedrals of each residue. In this
analysis, we will lump the PPII and β into one rotameric state,
as, for a given residue, it is hard to distinguish those two regions
in the Ub ensemble data. Thus, four regions will be used: they are
designated as and centered on α (−90,–30), β-PPII
(−120,150), αL (90,45), and O (90,120).

Some clustering
algorithm must be used to obtain the MoRFs in the 2N dimensional Rama(2N) space. Previously, a “compositional
clustering” method was introduced whereby each dihedral angle
of interest is separately clustered into its discrete rotamers and
a state of a sequence was defined as the direct product of each rotamer’s
conformation78 (the clustering of each
dihedral angle is carried out in “Fisher” coordinates79 that represent each angle in terms of its sine
and cosine to provide a proper metric in the periodic dihedral space).
In this discrete basis, a state characterizes the conformation of
the sequence for each trajectory sample. The state populations are
then readily obtained from their proportions in the trajectory. The
virtue of compositional clustering in the dihedral space is that each
dihedral is separately accounted for versus typical global clustering
algorithms that cluster by summing over a set of coordinates. Here,
the clustering of each residue is done in Rama(1). The states of 2N dimensional units can be found, along with the N-dimensional states of the units’ first and last
halves, forming the putative MoRF, using the compositional clustering
method. The MI can be evaluated from eq 5.2 using the samples of these three
sets of states, along with the entropies H(X) and H(Y), to obtain MInormed(X;Y)of eq 5.6.

5.6 Protocol
for Obtaining MoRFs
All
data used in this Ub study were obtained as pdb files, as described
in Section 2.1. The
Biopython80 or Analyzer81 software was used to generate the dihedral backbone angle
samples from the pdb files. The Rama(1) samples of each residue were
concatenated into Rama(2N) data files and used as
input to our k means program that does the compositional clustering
in the Fisher representation of each residue. For a unit of unitSize
2N, the clusters are in a 2(φ/ψ) ×
2(Fisher) × 2N(unitSize dimension) = 8N dimensional space. We examined unitSizes 2N = 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 so that the maximum cluster dimension is 40.
If the clustering were done directly on the units, as some experimentation
showed, the sharpness of clustering arising from the rotameric sampling
in Rama(1) space would be greatly reduced.
