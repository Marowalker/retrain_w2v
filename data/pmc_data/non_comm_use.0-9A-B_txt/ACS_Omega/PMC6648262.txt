To
address the instability and repulsive interaction of carbon
nanotubes (CNTs) in Li-ion batteries, mixed polymers (polyacrylonitrile
and polyvinylpyrrolidone) were employed as matrix support to ensure
that CNT particles remain in place during charge/discharge process
and prevent particle migration. Various CNT-based anodes have been
reported, but these require metal support that could result in contact
resistance. Hence, free-standing CNT electrodes are an attractive
option. A simple method of electrospinning polymers and calcination
at 800 °C is presented with CNT loading as high as 50 wt % can
be obtained without binder and acts as main active material rather
than an additive as described in previous studies. The anode [pyrolyzed
polymer (PP)-CNT] showed excellent performance with a high discharge
specific capacity of 960 mA h/g at a current density of 200 mA/g.
The capacity at a higher current density (1600 mA/g) remained greater
than graphite (372 mA h/g) at 521 mA h/g and showed a high stability
for 675 cycles without exhibiting any significant capacity loss with
a Coulombic efficiency of >95%. A rate capability experiment showed
the reversibility of PP-CNTs after subjecting them to an increasing
current density and regaining >95% of the initial capacity at a
low
current density (200 mA/g). The high capacitive performance of the
material is attributed to the high loading of CNTs and their containment
within the bulk of the polymer matrix to prevent particle migration
and agglomeration as well as the capacity of the nanofibers to preserve
a tight proximity of the electrolyte–electrode interface.

Introduction
Energy storage devices
have emerged as the current leading breakthrough
for alternative technology to the traditional rechargeable batteries
such as lead–acid batteries, nickel–cadmium batteries,
and nickel–metal hydride batteries.1−3 Most of the
electronic devices nowadays use Li-ion batteries (LIBs) to power a
wide range of portable devices such as cell phones, laptops, digital
cameras, and so on.4−6 The surge of interest to develop electrode material
has paved the way to consider LIBs as a secondary power unit to electronic
vehicles to replace fossil fuel-based energy.7 Graphite has been widely used commercially as it is relatively cheap,
readily available, and has a long lifespan. However, graphite has
a very limited capacity of 372 mA h/g, which limits its application,
which requires a higher capacity.8−10

To meet the increasing
demand for energy, considerable efforts
have been made to study different kinds of anode materials. Among
the potential candidates, the most widely explored materials for LIBs
are graphene, carbon nanotubes (CNTs), hierarchically porous carbon,
hollow carbon nanospheres, and so on.11−16 Among the materials mentioned, CNTs present unique and attractive
benefits as an active material. In comparison to graphite, they can
significantly increase the specific capacity without suffering from
pulverization because of their mechanical stability. They also offer
a unique structure (one-dimensional cylindrical tube) as a support
for composite materials, high conductivity, and relative inertness,
which are highly attractive characteristics for an anode material
from a practical point of view.17

Recently reported studies showed utilization of CNTs both as a
support and main component for anode materials. Lin et al. synthesized
a nano-TiNb2O7/CNT composite with a specific
capacity of 346 mA h/g at 0.1 C and 163 mA h/g at a high C-rate (30
C) with a fairly simple synthesis method.18 Although the anode material presents a facile synthesis, it requires
the usage of highly toxic chemicals such as acid treatments on CNTs.
Consequently, it can change the intrinsic properties of CNTs and form
unnecessary and uncontrollable defects. On the other hand, Zhao et
al. reported an in situ growth amorphous CNT on a Si particle via
chemical vapor deposition.19 The reported
capacity is 1496 mA h/g at 100 mA/g, but reversible capacity can only
retain 80% of its original capacitance after 300 cycles. Aside from
being used as an additive, CNT as a sole anode material has also been
widely explored. Di Lecce et al. report the use of a multiwalled CNT
against three different kinds of cathode materials. However, because
of CNT’s powder nature, it requires to be cast onto a metal
foil as support together with different materials such as binder,
which can result in an increase in contact resistance.20 With the increase in the number of components
arises different types of material interfaces that can heavily impact
the overall internal resistance of LIBs.21 Therefore, developing a freestanding electrode system is highly
required to reduce the interfaces between grains of active material
and present an easier fabrication method.

In this study, facile
fabrication of an electrospun polymer nanofiber
with a CNT loading amounting up to 50 wt % (based on the polymer amount)
has been presented. This high loading was made possible by using two
kinds of polymer to control the viscosity of the polymer solution.
This polymer matrix serves as a porous support to the CNT during the
charge/discharge process to prevent any type of movement or migration
as well as an electrolyte reservoir. In addition, this polymer matrix
also serves to hold the electrode material and render the fabricated
polymer nanofiber as a freestanding anode material. This fabrication
method is not only limited to the LIB application but could also find
potential benefits in other storage applications such as sodium and
potassium batteries where liquid electrolyte is highly beneficial.22−24 The electrode material can absorb the electrolyte and maintain a
good electrode–electrolyte contact, promoting the conduction
of ions, especially for all-solid-state systems. Pyrolyzed polymer
(PP)-CNTs calcined at 800 °C showed excellent performance at
a current density of 200 mA/g with a lithium storage capacity of 960
mA h/g after 500 cycles and maintained a Coulombic efficiency of ∼97–99%.
At a high current density of 1600 mA/g, the capacitance remained higher
than that of graphite (372 mA h/g), recording a value at 521 mA h/g,
which is an outstanding performance and reproduced 95% of the original
capacitance of 915 mA h/g, indicating its excellent rate capability.

Results
and Discussion
Preparing the Anode Material
The
preparation of the
electrode material is illustrated in Scheme 1. In lieu of fabricating a high loading CNT
polymer nanofiber, the CNT should be properly dispersed to guarantee
good distribution throughout the bulk of the nanofibers. This also
prevents the possibility of forming large particles that could disrupt
the flow of the polymer solution during the electrospinning process.25 Thus, in order to fabricate the polymer fiber,
the CNTs were finely ground and sieved to selectively filter out the
larger-sized particles and use only fine powders to create the suspension
to ensure a well-dispersed solution. N,N′-Dimethylformamide (DMF), commonly used in combination to
make a CNT suspension, was chosen as the main solvent. It can also
dissolve both polyacrylonitrile (PAN) and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP),
easily making it the ideal choice. Before adding the polymers, the
DMF solution of CNTs was ultrasonicated to enhance the dispersion
in the solution. Both PAN and PVP were added and stirred overnight
to allow proper mixing of the polymers and the CNTs. Utilizing PAN
and PVP was integral in achieving high CNT loading in the as-spun
polymer nanofiber. A minimum requirement of at least 10 wt % polymer
is necessary to electrospin a decent amount of CNT loading (∼20
wt % CNT, based on polymer amount). However, above 20 wt % CNT, the
PAN solution tends to become too viscous to be electrospun when utilized
alone. PAN, as a support, presents an advantage because it is considered
as the polymer that has the highest carbon yield after thermal treatment
as compared to other polymers.26,27 It will result in better
stability as a matrix support for the CNT after pyrolysis. If the
carbon yield is too low, the integrity of holding the CNT particles
inside can be compromised and could lead to most of the CNT particles
falling out of the polymer matrix after heat treatment. Moreover,
the nanofiber morphology might not even form if there is a very low
carbon yield. Thus, it is important to choose an appropriate temperature.
Hence, 800 °C was chosen for the thermal treatment to balance
the trade-off between conductivity and carbon yield.28 In order to circumvent the viscosity issue, a mixed polymer
(PAN and PVP) was used to decrease the viscosity and yet maintain
the polymer weight loading at 10 wt %. Using the optimum weight ratio
(1:1), a high CNT loading (50 wt %) polymer nanofiber was obtained.
Shown in Scheme S1 is an example image
of the freestanding electrodes with PP-CNT acting as the main anode
material, and without CNT loading (PP), which will be used as the
control for performance comparison. Decreasing the amount of PAN below
1:1 renders the polymer fiber too weak to hold its form and it will
not be successfully electrospun.

Scheme 1 Schematic Representation of the Fabrication
of Polymer Fiber Composite
Figure 1a,b shows
the nanofiber morphology of the as-spun polymer nanofibers and heat-treated
polymer nanofibers at 800 °C. It can be seen that the material
retained its structure after pyrolysis and contains a similar appearance
to the as-spun nanofibers. Large CNT particles were still present
but most of them were fixed within the nanofiber matrix as observed
in the low magnification images. Also, a few large CNT particles can
be observed located in the external matrix of the polymer nanofiber.
These can still be stabilized by the polymer nanofiber through the
interpore formed by intersecting polymer fibers around the large CNT
particle. After heat treatment, the PP-CNT was obtained and exhibits
the same morphology (Figure 1c,d). At a higher magnification (Figure S1), the surface of the nanofiber exhibits a difference in
contrast in certain areas with bright spots throughout the entire
fiber. Indicated in red circles, these are the individual CNT strands
that are protruding and extending outward from the surface of the
carbon matrix. This can be observed throughout the surface of all
the fibers, which indicates that there is an even distribution of
the CNTs, hence successfully embedding the high amount of CNTs inside.
The exposed strands can result in an enhancement of the performance
of the material because of a more direct contact with the electrolyte
solution as compared to the CNT inside the polymer matrix. It can
also prove beneficial where the initial Li+ intercalation
can occur through the exposed strands and the lithium ion can migrate
easier into the bulk.

Figure 1 FE-SEM images of (a,b) as-spun PAN-PVP-CNT and (c,d) pyrolyzed
PP-CNT nanofibers.

TEM images shown in Figure S2a,b further
support the successful embedding of CNT particles inside the polymer
matrix. At a low magnification, CNT strands can be seen occupying
the inner portion of the polymer matrix at the edge of the nanofiber.
Moreover, Figure S2b clearly shows from
a cross-sectionally broken CNT-polymer nanofiber that several CNT
strands are protruding out from the center of the material. This observation,
together with the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images, defines
and supports the claim that the CNTs are bound within the structural
framework provided by the nanofiber, creating a mechanical stabilizer
that prevents any type of CNT movement under bias.

To establish
the presence of CNTs in the polymer nanofiber, different
spectroscopic analyses were employed. The anode material was analyzed
with Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) (Figure 2a) to show characteristic peaks
of PAN at ∼2240, ∼2930, and ∼1453 cm–1 for the nitrile group (−C≡N) and stretching and bending
vibration of the methylene group (=C–H), respectively.29 PVP also showed distinct peaks such as hydroxyl
groups (−OH) with a strong broad peak at ∼3406 cm–1, and the methylene group (=C–H) and
the carboxyl group (−C=O) at 1647 cm–1.30 All these functionalities are evidently
present in the as-spun PP-CNTs, which proves that the mixed polymer
nanofiber is successfully fabricated. In addition, the FT-IR spectrum
(Figure 2b) of CNT,
PAN-PVP-CNT, and PP-CNT electrodes shows a very similar IR spectrum
compared with the pristine CNT, indicating the preserved features
and presence of the CNT within the material. The peaks corresponding
to the polymer fibers disappeared after calcination and only a strong
broad peak and sharp peak at ∼3440 for hydroxyl groups and
∼1623 cm–1 for conjugated carbon (C=C)
was observed. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis (Figure 2c) shows the crystallinity of CNT by the
presence of the peaks corresponding to the (002) and (100) phases
both in the pristine CNT and the PAN-PVP-CNT. These peaks, in lower
intensity, still remained even before and after calcination as evidenced
by the observed peak at ∼25° and a broader peak at ∼43°.31 The broad peak for the PAN-PVP-CNT at ∼19°
can be attributed to the polymer nanofiber, which is evidently shown
in Figure S3 wherein only amorphous phases
of the polymer nanofibers are present in the spectra of all the samples.
This amorphous peak, however, disappears because of its transformation
to graphitized carbon species after calcination.32,33Figure 2d presents
the Raman spectra of PAN-PVP-CNT and PP-CNT. Two distinct peaks were
observed at around ∼1320 and 1581 cm–1 that
are assigned to D and G bands, respectively. The G band is associated
with the highly ordered and graphitized carbons with an sp2 hybridization. On the other hand, the D band is normally associated
with defects and disordered carbons and the intensity of these two
bands reflect the amount of graphitization, hence the degree of conductivity
of a carbon material.34,35 The ID/IG ratio of the as-spun PP-CNT decreased
from 0.93 to 0.70 (PP-CNT), indicating that more graphitized carbon
species were introduced on the surface as a result of carbonization.36,37

Figure 2 Spectroscopic
analysis of bare polymer nanofiber and PP-CNT using
(a,b), FT-IR, (c) XRD, and (d) Raman analysis.

The Brunner–Emmet–Teller (BET) surface area
and porosity
of CNT and PP-CNT were characterized by N2 adsorption–desorption
isotherm measurements at 77 K, as shown in Figure 3a,b, respectively. The isotherm of both samples
belongs to type IV with a hysteresis loop (according to the International
Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) classification), indicating
its mesoporous structure as evidenced also in Figure 3b. The pore size distribution curve for PP-CNTs
showed a peak and a slight shouldering at around ∼17 and ∼28
nm attributed to the presence of CNTs within the nanofiber. As the
CNTs were embedded, the intensity of the peaks was expected to diminish
not because of structural changes and deformation but because of lower
accessibility to the pore structure of CNTs in PP-CNTs as compared
to the pristine CNTs. The recorded surface areas of CNTs and PP-CNTs
were 582 and 388 m2/g, respectively. The recorded pore
volumes were 2.41 and 0.701 with an average pore diameter of 16.5
and 12.7 both for CNTs and PP-CNTs. Although the surface area and
the pore volume decreased, fixing the CNTs in place will prevent the
migration of the particles and prevent repulsive interaction of adjacent
CNT particles during the charge/discharge process. Formation of agglomerated
particles is unfavorable in the LIB system because larger particles
have a lower surface area in contact with the electrolyte regardless
of the amount of loading. This leads to a low discharge capacity or
can also render them highly inactive material because most of the
CNTs in the bulk do not have a direct interaction with the electrolyte
solution. Smaller particles will have a higher surface area to electrolyte
ratio and will be able to maximize the amount of CNTs in the anode
material. The presence of the polymer matrix will also act as an electrolyte
pool or reservoir to maintain a tight proximity of the electrolyte
(Li+ ions) and the CNT particles. Moreover, better ion
diffusion can be expected because of the porous nature of the PP nanofiber.

adsorption/desorption isotherm curves and (b) pore
size distribution curve for a CNT and a PP-CNT recorded at 77 K.

Electrochemical Measurement
Initially, the as-spun
polymer fibers were used as anode material without heat treatment.
The data are presented in Figure S5 where
the performance is compared to PP-CNTs after pyrolysis. Because of
the nature of polymers as an insulating material, no significant activity
was observed during the charge/discharge process. The untreated polymer
layer passivated the CNT particles and did not exhibit good conductance.
Thus, the thermal treatment of the polymer fiber was proven integral
to render the polymer nanofiber a highly conductive layer, resulting
in a high-performance electrode. The polymer nanofiber was first stabilized
at 280 °C to stabilize and convert the carbon skeleton into a
graphitic-like structure and then increased the temperature to 800
°C to improve its porosity and surface area because of the transformation
of the carbon skeleton of PAN into graphitic carbon and this is a
widely established concept for carbon material. Temperature for the
heat treatment is a crucial factor because it will dictate the performance
of the anode material. As previously mentioned, carbon yield and the
diameter of the nanofiber are important to maintain the integrity
of the matrix and hold the CNT intact. At the same time, the degree
of graphitization must also be optimized in such a way that high conductivity
can be observed. The carbonization temperature of 800 °C was
chosen as a trade-off between the nanofiber diameter and conductivity.
According to previous reports, the nanofiber diameter decreases as
carbonization temperature increases, whereas the conductivity increases
with carbonization temperature.38 Higher
graphitization occurs in higher temperature and causes the formation
of more graphitic sheets and these layers have good stacking, resulting
in higher conductivity. However, the degradation of carbon becomes
more prominent as the temperature increases and, thus, an optimum
temperature of 800 °C was chosen to accommodate both good fiber
diameter and conductivity.39

The
electrochemical properties of the PP-CNT were investigated through
a series of comprehensive electrochemical analyses. After assembling
the coin cell, cyclic voltammetry was conducted to determine the behavior
of the anode material against a Li metal as both the counter and reference
electrodes. Figure 4a shows the first three cyclic voltammetry curves for PP-CNT. The
graph shows a typical curve observed for carbonaceous material. The
first curve consists of a broad peak at around 0.5–1.0 V and
disappears at the second and third curves, indicating the formation
of a solid-electrolyte interface (SEI) layer. Normally, this is indicated
by a high irreversible capacity for the first few cycles during charge/discharge.
Insertion of the Li+ ion is denoted by the peak at ∼0
V. This is present throughout the cycles but diminishes only after
the first cycle, which is attributed to the initial intercalation
of Li+ ions into the CNT material. Delithiation is represented
by a very weak and broad anodic peak at approximately ∼1.0
V. Succeeding cycles exhibit similar and overlapping peaks and curves,
which means that PP-CNT has excellent reversibility and cycling stability
as an anode material for LIB application.40Figure 4b shows the
galvanostatic charge/discharge profiles of 1st, 2nd, and 3rd cycles
at 500 mA/g current density between 0.005 and 3.0 V. The initial discharge
capacity of 3100 mA h/g was observed in the PP-CNT electrode followed
by 1091 mA h/g charge capacity, with a Coulombic efficiency of 34.3%.
The lower Coulombic efficiency is mainly attributed to the large surface
area of the PP-CNT electrode. The initial capacity loss is mainly
because of either the inability to remove the complete Li+ ion inserted during the first discharge during following charging
or reduction of electrolyte and formation of an SEI layer on the electrode
surface.41,42

cycles; (c) cyclic performance for 675 cycles at 500, 200, and 1600
mA/g; and (d) rate capability at different current densities from
200 to 6400 mA/g.

To better understand
the behavior of the PP-CNT electrode under
cycling mode with different current densities, it was tested for long-term
cycling at current densities of 500, 200, and 1600 mA/g as shown in Figure 4c. Initially, the
PP-CNT electrode cycled for 50 cycles at a 500 mA/g current density.
From the cycling test, it is observed that during initial cycles the
discharge capacity of the PP-CNT electrode decreased continuously
and got stabilized after 13 cycles. Despite capacity decay during
initial cycles, the discharge capacity can retain a value of 800 mA
h/g after 50 cycles. Furthermore, the same cell was cycled at 200
mA/g for another 50 cycles and discharge capacity performance is depicted
in Figures 4c and S4. Figure S5 clearly
shows that the capacity is almost constant throughout the 50 cycles,
showing better stability of material. The PP-CNT retained a discharge
capacity of 960 mA h/g after 50 cycles with 99% Coulombic efficiency,
when cycled at a current density of 200 mA/g. Finally, to check long-term
stability at a high current density of 1600 mA/g, the same cell was
cycled for 675 cycles as shown in Figure 4c. The performance of the PP-CNT was further
evaluated in comparison with the bare CNT and PP. In all cases, the
PP-CNT outperformed the two former samples at 500 mA/g. Figure S6 shows the capacitance of all the individual
material wherein the CNT had a relatively stable performance, whereas,
on the other hand, PP exhibited a sudden drop in the capacitance before
the 50th cycle. The performance of the materials in separate conditions
proved to be inferior but a synergistic effect was observed with both
improved capacitance and stability when a composite of the two was
used as an anode material. The effect of combining both the structural
reinforcement of the polymeric matrix to allow electrolyte absorption
and preventing particle migration together with the conductivity and
lithiation mechanism of the CNT resulted in a high-performance freestanding
electrode.

The long-term cycling stability test reveals that
even at a high
current density of 1600 mA/g, the electrode retain capacity is 521
mA h/g, which is higher than the theoretical capacity of a commercial
graphite electrode (372 mA h/g). The corresponding charge/discharge
curves of the following cycling test at each of the separate current
densities (200, 500, 1600 mA/g) are presented in Figure S8, exhibiting good stability throughout the experiment.
Throughout all cycling tests, a Coulombic efficiency of above ∼97–99%
was observed, indicative of the high reversibility of the electrode.
The performance of the PP-CNT is excellent and even higher compared
to previously reported literature for carbon-based materials that
are listed in Table S1. The high electrochemical
performance of the PP-CNT electrode was mainly attributed to the 3D
structure of the electrode with high surface area, maintaining its
structural integrity.

Furthermore, the high rate of electrochemical
performance of the
PP-CNT electrode was investigated by a multiple-step galvanostatic
strategy and the results are shown in Figure 4d. Initially, the cell was cycled at 500
mA/g for 20 cycles in order to avoid the induced effect because of
activation of the electrode. After that, five cycles were measured
to evaluate the capacity of the electrode at different current densities
from 200 to 6400 mA/g stepwise and then decreased back to 200 mA/g.
The rate capability analysis shows stable capacity retention at each
current density. The electrode displayed the discharge capacities
of 960, 844, 698, 587, 455, 323, and 915 mA h/g at 200, 500, 800,
1600, 3200, 6400, and 200 mA/g, respectively. More importantly, when
the current density was decreased back to 200 from 6400 mA/g, the
Coulombic efficiency remained ∼97–99% with a high recorded
capacitance of ∼915 mA h/g which is ∼95% of the initial
capacitance (960 mA h/g), indicating the excellent rate capability.
The corresponding charge/discharge curves for the current densities
in this experiment are all provided in Figure S9. The high electrochemical performance of the PP-CNT electrode
can be attributed to the advantages of high surface area with porous
structures, which greatly enhance the diffusion kinetics and buffer
the volumetric changes.

In order to analyze the morphology change
after a long-term cycling
test, the electrode was soaked in dimethyl carbonate (DMC) solvent
for 10 h to remove the SEI layer and dried at 40 °C overnight.
No obvious change was observed after long-term cycling of the PP-CNT
electrode as shown in figure S7. The electrode
shows the nanofibers with a rougher surface.

To further understand
the behavior of the electrode material, the
electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurement was carried out. Figure 5a,b represents the
Nyquist plots before and after the cycling test with the representative
electric circuit diagram. In Figure 5a, charge transfer resistance is the only prominent
and observation curve followed by the diffusion curve at the low-frequency
region. On the other hand, in Figure 5b, the plot is divided into 5 sections (i–v).
Section (i) represents the electrolyte resistance, (ii,iii) appears
to have an overlapped region between two semicircles, which is attributed
to the surface film impedance (SEI layer) and the charge transfer
resistance, which can be represented by (R1||Q1) and (R2||Q2) having resistance values of 17.5
and 7.77 Ω, respectively. The third semicircle at the lower
frequency region is represented by (R3||Q3) attributed to Li+ intercalation
into the carbon, having a resistance value of 4.3 Ω.43

(b).

On the basis of the gathered results,
it is found that PP-CNT is
an excellent freestanding anode material used in a facile fabrication
method consisting of electrospinning and pyrolysis only. Moreover,
a highly corrosive and toxic acidic oxidation step, typically employing
CNT treatment for dispersion, was completely eliminated. As acidic
oxidation can highly alter the intrinsic properties of a CNT, performance
drop is mostly expected and stability can also pose problems. A good
illustration of the advantages of a PP-CNT is shown in Scheme 2 wherein the polymer matrix
serves a dual purpose. First, it provided the stability for CNT to
prevent its migration, even at a high loading (ca. 50 wt %), and maintain
its dispersed state by fixing them in a specific site within the bulk
of the matrix. Second, it acts as an electrolyte reservoir that will
preserve a consistent CNT–electrolyte interface throughout
all processes. The lithium ions can both penetrate through the porous
carbon and diffuse through the matrix or the lithium ions and can
directly lithiate the CNT strands that are already slightly exposed
from the surface of the nanofibers. Regardless, the lithium ions are
facilitated to diffuse faster and maintain close proximity with the
active site, preventing the agglomeration of CNTs and maintaining
their well-dispersed arrangement by locking them in place, allowing
for a more active site to be utilized during the charge/discharge
process. The electrons flow through the CNT strands and extend out
throughout the graphitized polymer matrix, creating a long-range conductivity
to allow lithiation within the electrode material wherever lithium
ions are present. Through this cooperative implementation of the stabilizing
effect, a highly stable anode material was obtained. Thus, this study
presents a method that can be highly attractive for practical applications
and large-scale attempts.

CNT Stabilization
In summary, a simple and safe fabrication of a PAN and
PVP mixed
polymer nanofiber with high CNT loading has been presented without
the need of acidic oxidation to improve CNT dispersion in solution.
A freestanding anode material (PP-CNT) was obtained after heat treatment
and exhibited an outstanding lithium storage capacity of 960 mA h/g
for more than 675 cycles at a high current density of 1600 mA/g with
a consistent Coulombic efficiency of >95%. The rate capability
experiment
demonstrated the high reversibility of PP-CNT for a wide range of
current densities and regaining >95% of its initial lithium storage
capacity. The current study can be further extended for future development
in LIBs and branch to other types of energy storage device applications.

Experimental Procedure
Materials and Reagents
CNTs were
provided by Samsung
Company. PAN (average Mw 150 000)
and PVP (average Mw 1 300 000)
were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. N,N′-Dimethyl formamide was purchased from Daejung Chemicals.
All chemicals were of analytical reagent grade and commercially available,
and used without further purifications. Deionized (D.I.) water was
used throughout the experiments.

Fabrication of PP-CNT Nanofibers
CNTs (provided by
Samsung) were ground and sieved (150 and 180 μm mesh size) properly
before suspending in DMF solution. The CNTs were dispersed for 1 h
using an ultrasonicator under an ice bath throughout the entire process.
Subsequently, appropriate amounts of PAN and PVP were dissolved in
the DMF solution to make a 10 wt % polymer solution with a 50 wt %
CNT loading (based on the polymer amount). The mixture was heated
to 50 °C and stirred overnight. The homogeneous solution was
transferred into a polypropylene syringe with a 0.51 mm inner diameter
needle tip. The syringe pump (model: EP100, NanoNC) flow rate was
kept for 1 mL/h with an applied voltage (HV Power Supply, HV30, NanoNC)
of 15–18 kV to form the nanofibers collected on an aluminum
foil. The drum-type collector (model: DC90, NanoNC) and needle tip
distance was 13 cm. The fabricated polymer fibers were vacuum-dried
at 50 °C overnight. The polymer fibers were then subjected to
thermal treatment at 280 °C at a ramping rate of 1 °C/min
and held for 1 h. Then, the temperature was increased to 800 °C
at a ramping rate of 5 °C/min and held for 1 h under nitrogen
and cooled down to room temperature. The pyrolyzed polymer CNT nanofibers
(denoted as PP-CNT in this paper) were used as desired.

Fabrication
of Pyrolyzed PAN-PVP (PP)
A similar procedure
was conducted as mentioned above to fabricate pyrolyzed PAN-PVP without
the loading of CNTs. Briefly, both PAN and PVP were dissolved in DMF
to create a 10 wt % polymer solution. The mixture was stirred overnight
at 50 °C to ensure the proper mixing and dissolution of the materials.
The homogeneous solution was transferred into a polypropylene syringe
with a 0.51 mm inner diameter needle tip. The syringe pump (model:
EP100, NanoNC) flow rate was kept at 1 mL/h with an applied voltage
(HV Power Supply, HV30, NanoNC) of 15–18 kV to form the nanofibers
collected on an aluminum foil. The drum-type collector (model: DC90,
NanoNC) and needle tip distance was 13 cm. The fabricated polymer
fibers were vacuum-dried at 50 °C overnight. The polymer fibers
were then subjected to thermal treatment at 280 °C at a ramping
rate of 1 °C/min and held for 1 h. Then, the temperature was
increased to 800 °C at a ramping rate of 5 °C/min and held
for 1 h under nitrogen and cooled down to room temperature. The nanofiber
material obtained was labeled as PP.

Fabrication of the CNT
Electrode
The CNT electrode
was prepared by mixing CNT and poly(vinylidene difluoride) (at a weight
ratio of 80:20) in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone to create
a paste-like solution. This was uniformly spread on a copper foil,
as the current collector, using an automatic control coater. The material
was dried at 80 °C overnight to completely remove the moisture
and residual solvents. Afterward, the prepared electrodes were punched
into circular discs and used as anode material to assemble coin cells
for electrochemical measurement.

Material Characterization
The phase and morphology
of the material were characterized by a powder X-ray diffractometer
(Shimadzu XRD-6000) with Cu Kα irradiation (λ = 1.5406
Å); field emission SEM (FE-SEM, Sigma S-4000) for the morphological
studies and infrared spectra of the prepared the electrodes were obtained
using FT-IR spectroscopy (Agilent, Cary 630). Raman spectra were recorded
on a Photon Design spectrometer using an argon ion laser with an excitation
wavelength of 514 nm. The specific surface area and pore size distribution
of the materials were all studied by a BELSORP-miniII (BEL, Japan)
instrument with the method of BET and micropore analysis for surface
area and pore size distribution analysis, respectively. Prior to the
actual absorption experiment, the samples were degassed at 100 °C
for 12 h.

Electrochemical Measurement
All electrochemical measurements
were executed using coin-type 2032 cells. To prepare working electrodes,
the as-prepared active materials (50 wt % CNT pyrolyzed nanofibers)
were punched into circular discs and electrochemical measurements
of the electrode materials were carried out using a coin-type half-cell
(2032) assembled in an Ar-filled glove box with lithium metal as a
counter electrode and glass fiber, soaked with LiPF6 in
ethylene carbonate and DMC (1:1, by volume), as the separator. The
electrochemical tests of the electrode were investigated by performing
cyclic voltammogram measurements at a scan rate of 0.05 mV/s in the
voltage range of 0–3.0 V (vs Li/Li+) using the Won-A-Tech
potentiostat/galvanostatic instrument at 25 °C. Furthermore,
the cells were galvanostatically discharge–charged between
0.005 and 3.0 V versus Li/Li+ using a Won-A-Tech battery
cycler. The impendence spectra of the assembled half-cells were recorded
with an amplitude of 10 mV over a frequency range from 1 Hz to 1 MHz
using the ZIVE SP2 instrument. All electrochemical tests were conducted
at 25 °C.
