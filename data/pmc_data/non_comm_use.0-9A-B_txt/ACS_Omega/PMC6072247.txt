The
development of nanomaterial-based hybrid systems for healthcare
and energy-related materials has attracted significant attention nowadays.
Here, we have designed a nanocomposite of ZnO nanoparticles (NPs)
with anticancer therapeutic drug 9-aminoacridine hydrochloride hydrate
(9AA-HCl) for antibacterial and photocatalytic activities. Spectroscopic
studies reveal that the photoinduced electron transfer from photoexcited
9AA-HCl to the conduction band of ZnO NP causes the generation of
the reactive oxygen species (ROS), which is responsible for antibacterial
activity and photocatalytic properties. It is seen that the efficiency
of photodegradation of dye molecules increases in ZnO–9AA-HCl
nanoconjugated systems than pure ZnO nanoparticles because of efficient
charge separation. In addition, the antibacterial efficacy of the
nanoconjugate is investigated using a strain of Gram-negative bacteria
where the cell-killing activities are observed 99.99 and 100% for
20 and 21 μL/mL nanoconjugate, respectively, and very little
cell-killing activity is observed for free ZnO NPs and free drug.
Moreover, it is also observed that the nanoconjugate generates sufficient
intracellular ROS that can hydrolyze 2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluoresceindiacetate
(DCFH-DA) to highly fluorescent 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein
(DCF). The outcome of the study will provide valuable information
for designing new-edge nanoconjugate materials for potential applications
in photocatalytic and antibacterial activities.

Introduction
Oxide nanomaterials
are found to have potential for various applications
such as light harvesting and healthcare. Among them, ZnO and TiO2 are the most used oxide nanomaterials for hydrogen generation,
sunscreen, antimicrobial activity, and photocatalysis.1−5 Zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO NPs) have several advantages such
as high photosensitivity, thermal stability, low toxicity, and good
biocompatibility, which are important for photocatalytic and biological
applications.6−8 Yuan et al. have used ZnO quantum dots for tumor-targeted
drug delivery8 after combination with chitosan
and doxorubicin (DOX). A pH-responsive drug delivery system
has been designed by Liu et al. where the anticancer drug DOX is conjugated
with ZnO NP.9 It is also found that noble
metal/zinc oxide hybrid materials are being used for water purification
and different pathogenic applications.10−14 ZnO nanostructured materials are generally insoluble
in biological environment, whereas they can dissolve in an acidic
biological environment.6,15−17 However, the
surface of ZnO NP is affected in a strong basic condition.18 It is also seen that ZnO NPs are being used
for nanocarriers for enhancing the release process.19

ZnO composite materials with polymers, bioimaging
dye, and photodynamic
therapeutic (PDT) drugs have been designed for bioapplications because
of easy functionalization of the surface of ZnO NPs.20−22 In PDT drugs, the photosensitive dye molecules are being excited
by visible or near-infrared wavelength of light and subsequently the
excited energy is transferred to the surroundings for the generation
of highly reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as superoxide, hydroperoxyl,
and hydroxyl radicals.23−26 The multifunctional features of ZnO materials inspired us to develop
a conjugate system (inorganic–organic hybrid) of ZnO NP with
antibacterial therapeutic drug, 9-aminoacridine hydrochloride hydrate
(9AA-HCl). Different pH-dependent forms of 9-aminoacridine hydrochloride
hydrate (9AA-HCl) are given in Scheme 1.27 Moreover, 9AA-HCl drug
is a very important drug for antibacterial, mutagenic, and antitumor
activities.28−31 9AA-HCl is being used as a DNA intercalation agent also.28,29,32 Encapsulation of this drug inside
the silica nanoparticles is also used for imaging the membranes.33 It is reported that the antibacterial activity
of 9AA-HCl is greatly enhanced after conjugation with gold nanoparticles.34 Sardar et al. also reported the influence of
protoporphyrin–ZnO nanohybrid on the growth of Escherichia coli.35 It
is found that the generation of ROS is the key factor for photochemical
and photophysical processes between PDT drug and semiconductor nanoparticles.
The photocatalytic activity of the inorganic semiconductor is controlled
by ROS generation because ROS oxidize the organic compound.36−39 The recombination of photogenerated electron and hole in semiconducting
nanoparticles controls the photocatalytic efficiency, and the efficiency
of photocatalysis is decreased because of the fast recombination process
compared to the surface redox reactions.40,41 Therefore, inorganic–organic hybrid nanomaterials are most
useful for such applications because of the efficient charge transfer
(electron or hole transfer) process and reduce the recombination of
the electron–hole pairs.41−46 Here, ZnO NP–9AA-HCl nanocomposite has been designed to investigate
the influence of charge separation on photocatalytic and antibacterial
activity. Steady-state and time-resolved spectroscopic studies are
being used to investigate the charge transfer process in ZnO NP–9AA-HCl
nanocomposite. Analysis reveals that the electron transfer from the
drug molecule to the semiconductor occurs after photoexcitation, which
consequently influences the photocatalytic efficiency as well as the
antibacterial efficacy of the hybrid system. A strain of Gram-negative
bacteria is being used for the antibacterial efficacy of drug-coated
ZnO NPs.

Results and Discussion
We have synthesized
ZnO NP in a solution phase technique using
the earlier work.47,48 The transmission electron microscopy
(TEM) micrograph of synthesized ZnO NP is presented in Figure S1A. The monodisperse ZnO NPs of size
∼6.2 ± 0.5 nm are synthesized using TMOH (Figure S1B). Figure 1 illustrates the TEM image of 9AA-HCl–ZnO
nanohybrid, which confirms the consistency of nearly spherical nanocrystals.

Figure 1 Transmission
electron micrograph of the nanoconjugate (ZnO–9AA-HCl).

The binding nature between the
9AA-HCl drug and ZnO NP is investigated
using Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) technique as the attachment
is very crucial for biological applications. The FTIR spectra of bare
ZnO NP, 9AA-HCl, and nanoconjugate are presented in Figure 2. The characteristic peak of
pure 9AA-HCl at 3337 cm–1 is due to the stretching
frequency of the amine group (−NH2).34 After conjugation with ZnO NP, the stretching
frequency of the amine moiety of the drug is shifted and broadened.
The shifting of the stretching frequency clearly indicates the covalent
bonding formed between the amine group and ZnO NP.35,49 The broad band around 3370–3400 cm–1 and
sharp band around 1630–1635 cm–1 are due
to surface hydroxyl groups of ZnO,50,51 which are
affected after conjugation with the drug molecule. The shifting of
band position of −OH stretching suggests the formation of hydrogen
bonding between ZnO NP and 9AA-HCl.52,53

of bare ZnO (i), only 9AA-HCl (ii), and ZnO–9AA-HCl
conjugate (iii).

Raman spectra of ZnO
NP and after conjugation with 9AA-HCl are
shown in Figure 3.
No Raman band is observed in 9AA-HCl in the wavenumber range from
300 to 600 cm–1 because of its highly fluorescent
molecule after excitation at 532 nm. According to space group theory,
the Raman active vibrational modes of ZnO structure are A1 + 2E2 + E1. As evident from the figure, four
vibration peaks at 328, 378, 438, and 577 cm–1 of
ZnO NP confirm the presence of a wurtzite structure.51,54 The strong band at 438 cm–1 is a nonpolar optical
phonon E2 mode of ZnO NP, which is due to the oxygen deficiency.
The peaks at 378 and 577 cm–1 are due to the polar
transverse A1 and longitudinal E1 optical phonon
mode, respectively. The peak at 332 cm–1 is assigned
to the E2high–E2low mode.51 It is noted that the E2 mode (due to defect centers) of ZnO NP is significantly changed
after conjugation of 9AA-HCl with ZnO NP, indicating the passivation
of the ZnO NPs surface with 9AA-HCl.

NPs (red).

Steady-State and Time-Resolved Spectroscopic
Studies of a ZnO–9AA-HCl
System
The formation of ZnO–9AA-HCl nanohybrid is
characterized by UV–vis spectroscopy. The photodynamic therapeutic
drug, 9AA-HCl, has two pKa values of −2.0
and 10.0.55 At pH < −2.0, that
is, in the presence of concentrated strong acid, the doubly protonated
form predominates, whereas within −2.0 < pH < 10.0, the
protonated form, that is, 9AAH+ prevails. In pH > 10.0,
the neutral 9AA-HCl, that is, 9AA is formed through the deprotonation
of 9AAH+ and it retains equilibrium between its amino and
imino tautomers.56Figure S2A,B illustrates that the absorption peaks and the
fluorescence peaks of the neutral form of 9AA-HCl, that is, 9AA at
pH = 11.0 are slightly red shifted compared to that of the protonated
form of 9AA-HCl, that is, 9AAH+ at pH = 4.0. Figure 4 displays the absorption spectra
of bare ZnO NP, 9AA-HCl, and ZnO–9AA-HCl composite. The ZnO
NPs exhibit a threshold (i.e., band gap) at 345 nm (3.59 eV), and
9AA-HCl has maximum absorbance at 400 nm. No distinct peak of 9AA-HCl
is observed in the absorption spectrum of nanoconjugate because of
the very low concentration of drug molecule and the large scattering
of the ZnO NPs. The UV absorption peak of the nanoconjugate is slightly
blue shifted compared to ZnO, with an onset at 338 nm (3.67 eV). Analysis reveals that ZnO–9AA-HCl nanoconjugate is formed
by the interaction between ZnO and the amine group of 9AA-HCl and
not by the physical absorption.

ZnO NP, (b) 9AA-HCl, and
(c) ZnO–9AA-HCl.

Recently, it has been demonstrated that the photocurrent
generation
is due to efficient charge separation between ZnO NP and carbon dot.47 Again, laser flash photolysis study reveals
the photoinduced electron transfer (PET) between ZnO NP and methyl
viologen.48 It is reported that the visible
(green) emission from ZnO NPs arises due to oxygen vacancies.57 We monitored ZnO emission in the absence and
the presence of 9AA-HCl (Figure 5A), and it is noteworthy that the visible emission
of ZnO NP is caused by the surface states because the surface of the
particle is modified by the presence of the drug molecules. Herein,
the possibility of energy transfer is ruled out because there is no
spectral overlap between them. Thus, the emission quenching in the
visible region is solely due to photoinduced electron transfer. Here,
we have also observed that the emission of 9AA-HCl is quenched and
blue shifted after attachment with ZnO NP (Figure 5B). It is to be mentioned that the photoluminescence
(PL) spectrum of 9AA-HCl is almost identical with its neutral from
(as mentioned in Figure S2B) after conjugation
with ZnO NP. This result suggests that the neutral
form of 9AA-HCl predominates and forms hydrogen bonding with ZnO NP,
which is well supported by FTIR studies as mentioned in the earlier
section.

nm) of (a) bare ZnO and (b) ZnO-anchored 9AA-HCl. (B) Room-temperature
PL spectra (excitation wavelength was at 400 nm) of (a) bare 9AA-HCl
and (b) ZnO-anchored 9AA-HCl.

To understand the charge transfer between ZnO NP and 9AA-HCl,
all
of the samples were analyzed by time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy.
The measurements were carried out by exciting 9AA-HCl at 371 nm and
monitoring emission at 455 nm. Figure 6 displays the emission decay profile of only 9AA-HCl
and the nanoconjugate. These emission decay times are analyzed using
exponential decay kinetics, and the parameters of samples (9AA-HCl
and nanoconjugate) are summarized in Table S1. The average decay time is measured using the decay components.58 The almost similar decay times of the neutral
and singly protonated species were obtained, which are consistent
with the earlier work.59Figure 6 shows the fluorescence decay
curve of 9AA-HCl, which is fitted with single-exponential decay, and
the lifetime is 12.89 ns. In comparison, for ZnO–9AA-HCl nanohybrid,
the fluorescence decay profile is composed of a faster component of
0.65 ns (78%) and a slower component of 12.87 ns (22%). Although the
slower component is consistent with the excited-state lifetime of
9AA-HCl without ZnO, the faster one may be due to the electron transfer
from 9AA-HCl to ZnO NP.60 The decay time
decreases from 12.89 to 3.34 ns, suggesting the photoinduced electron
transfer (PET) from the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital of 9AA-HCl
to the conduction band of semiconductor via nonradiative pathway.60 The nonradiative rate constant (knr) is determined by comparing the decay time of 9AA-HCl
in the absence (τo) and in the presence (τ)
of ZnO NP, using the following equation 1  The rate of the electron transfer process
from the excited state of 9AA-HCl to the conduction band of ZnO NP
is estimated to be 1.54 × 109 s–1 (considering only the faster component), which is consistent with
the value reported in the literature.60 Therefore, the interfacial PET from the excited state of 9AA-HCl
to ZnO NP reduces the recombination of electron and hole of semiconductor,
which enhances the photocatalytic activity as well as the biological
activity which will be discussed in the further course of discussion.

decay curves of (a) 9AA-HCl and (b) the conjugate
(ZnO NP–9AA-HCl): (Ex 371 nm and Em 455 nm).

Photocatalytic Activity Study
The
charge transportation
and separation are considered to be key factors for improving the
photocatalytic activity.42 Here, we have
studied the degradation pattern of methylene blue (MB) dye in the
presence of ZnO–9AA-HCl composite to establish the photocatalytic
efficacy. It is well established that MB undergoes degradation in
the presence of UV light and this can be enhanced by photocatalysts
such as ZnO. It is seen from Figure 7 that the photodegradation efficiency after 30 min
of irradiation increases in the presence of 9AA-HCl and the efficiencies
are 72 ± 0.45 and 83.6 ± 0.22% for ZnO NP and the ZnO–9AA-HCl
conjugate, respectively. Moreover, it is evident from the obtained
results that the kinetics of dye degradation follows pseudo-first-order
and the rate of degradation is in the order MB < ZnO NPs < composite.
The calculated rate constants for the samples MB, ZnO NP, and composite
are found to be 0.013, 0.018, and 0.026 min–1 respectively.
The enhanced photocatalytic activity (conjugate has ∼1.44 times
higher catalytic activity than that of the only ZnO NP) is explained
by the enhanced charge separation in the composites, compared to bare
ZnO NPs. During photocatalytic reaction, the photoexcited 9AA-HCl
transfers an electron to the conduction band of ZnO NPs which consequently
generates reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the presence of oxygen
and water that can degrade the organic pollutant. The proposed mechanism
of ROS generation is described below. The valence band holes can oxidize
a large number of organic pollutants into CO2 and H2O, whereas conduction band electrons are strong reducing agents
which will be adsorbed by O2 to form a superoxide anion
which is strongly oxidizing and further oxidizes organic pollutants
into CO2 and H2O. Therefore, analysis suggests
that ZnO–9AA-HCl composite is an efficient photocatalytic material
that enhances the decomposition of aqueous organic pollutant MB.

Antibacterial Activity of the Nanoconjugate
For antibacterial
activity of this nanocomposite, the study was conducted on the E. coli K12 bacteria to determine the antibacterial
potency of only ZnO NP, only 9AA-HCl, and the nanoconjugate. The bacterial
cells were exposed to different concentrations of the respective sample
in medium for 18 h and followed by their viability determination from
colony counts on agar plates. The result depicted that the bacterial
cell numbers are static, that is, 2 × 105 up to the
concentration of 18 μL/mL of nanoconjugate after 18 h incubation
because bacterial population did not increase and is nearly the same
with that of the initial population. Thus, this concentration is considered
the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the nanoconjugate for E. coli K12. Above this concentration of the nanoconjugate,
the cell-killing takes place. The cells killing is 99.99 and 100%
for the concentrations of 20 and 21 μL/mL, respectively. Therefore,
the minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) of the nanoconjugate
is between 20 and 21 μL/mL. However, results of control experiments
showed that free ZnO NPs have no such kind of superior bactericidal
activity and the free drug has very little cell-killing activity (Figure 8).

Figure 8 Antibacterial activity
study where green bars represent nanoconjugate-exposed
cells, blue and red bars represent only ZnO NP, free drug 9AA-HCl
(of equivalent concentrations as present in the nanoconjugate) exposed
cells, respectively. Data are the mean of three replications with
±standard error.

Figure 9 depicts
the percentage distributions of cells in different quadrants. Increase
in intracellular ROS will result in a shift of the cell populations
to the higher fluorescent quadrant, that is, toward right side quadrant.
The cells were treated at their minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC)
values to check whether this concentration of nanocomposite is able
to generate sufficient intracellular ROS that can hydrolyze 2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluoresceindiacetate
(DCFH-DA) to highly fluorescent 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein
(DCF). For control-labeled cells, nearly 98% of cells are present
in the left lower quadrant (Figure 9). The treatment of bacterial cells with only ZnO NPs
and only 9AA-HCl does not elicit the intracellular ROS that much.
However, when the cells were treated with the ZnO NPs–9AA-HCl
nanoconjugate at their MIC value for 1 h, about 23% of cells acquired
a considerable higher fluorescence, that is, high level of ROS. Therefore,
analysis reveals that the nanoconjugate kills bacteria through ROS-mediated
pathways.

Figure 9 Flow cytometric analysis of intracellular ROS generation study
of control, only ZnO NP, free drug, and the nanoconjugate-exposed
cells at their MIC value for 1 h.

It is reported that the toxicity mechanism of ZnO NPs varies
in
various media as the species of dissolved Zn may change.61 ROS generation is also known as the major cause
of nanotoxicity.62−65 The toxicity of these species involves the destruction of cellular
components such as lipids, DNA, and proteins as a result of their
internalization into the bacterial cell membrane. Here, the results
clearly indicate that the enhanced ROS generation in the presence
of the nanoconjugate increases the antibacterial activity compared
to the free drug and free ZnO NP. The reason behind the enhanced activity
implies that the presence of ZnO NP in the proximity of 9AA-HCl facilitates
the charge separation along with the increase of Zn2+ ions.
Once nanoconjugates are in the growth media, they will carry on releasing
peroxides covering the entire surfaces of the dead bacteria. Therefore,
this continuous peroxide (because the increase of H+ in
the medium enhances the amount of H2O2) release
leads to higher bactericidal efficacy.

Conclusions
Here,
the semiconductor-therapeutic drug nanoconjugate exhibits
enhancement in photocatalytic activity and antibacterial activity
toward Gram-negative bacteria because of the generation of charge
carriers and ROS. The considerable changes in photophysical properties
of 9AA-HCl are observed after conjugation with ZnO NPs. The steady-state
and time-resolved fluorescence studies signify the fact that photoinduced
electron transfer (PET) occurs from 9AA-HCl to the conduction band
of ZnO NP. Moreover, the shifting of PL emission of 9AA-HCl, which
resembles the neutral form of 9AA-HCl, indicates the fact that the
H-bonding occurs between 9AA-HCl and ZnO NPs. Utilizing the charge
transfer phenomena, we have studied the photocatalytic property of
the nanoconjugate, which shows that the kinetics of MB dye degradation
follows pseudo-first-order and the rate of degradation is in the order
MB < ZnO NPs < nanoconjugate. In addition, the nanoconjugate
possesses superior antibacterial activity against E.
coli K12 compared to the free ZnO NPs and free drug.
The enhanced ROS generation in the reaction medium for the nanoconjugate
is the main reason behind such activity. Our investigation on the
photoinduced dynamics of ZnO NPs upon complexation with the anticancer
drug 9AA-HCl may open the avenue to utilize the unique electron-accepting
property of the semiconductor in the development of the photocatalyst
as well as drug delivery vehicles.

Experimental Section
Materials
and Methods
Materials
9-Aminoacridine hydrochloride
hydrate (9AA-HCl)
and zinc acetate dihydrate (Sigma-Aldrich) were used. Tetramethyl
ammonium hydroxide (Merck) (TMOH), spectroscopic-grade ethanol, methanol
and HPLC water (Merck) were used for the synthesis and experiment
in the present study.

Synthesis of ZnO Nanoparticles
We
prepared ZnO nanoparticles
(ZnO NPs) using the previously reported method.66 Zinc acetate dihydrate (0.22 g) was dissolved in 80 mL
of ethanol. The temperature of the solution was raised to 100 °C
after complete dissolution of zinc acetate. Then, 3 mL solution of
tetramethyl ammonium hydroxide (TMOH, 0.86 g in methanol) was added
slowly to the ethanolic solution of zinc acetate under stirring at
100 °C. The solution was then allowed to boil for another 30
min. The solution color turned from colorless to white, and it was
cooled down under stirring condition. ZnO NP was precipitated by centrifugation
at 10 000 rpm for 10 min and further dissolved in ethanol and
centrifuged. Washing was carried out several
times to remove the excess precursor. The obtained ZnO NPs are used
for the further study.

Synthesis of 9-Aminoacridine Hydrochloride
Hydrate–Zinc
Oxide Nanoparticle (9AA-HCl–ZnO NP) Nanoconjugates (Sensitization
of 9AA-HCl on the Surface of ZnO NPs)
An ethanolic solution
of 0.5 mL of 9AA-HCl was prepared under stirring. Then, this ethanolic
solution of 9AA-HCl was added with ZnO NPs under stirring condition
for 6 h. After the sensitization process, the obtained solution was
centrifuged for a few minutes and the clear supernatant solution containing
the unattached drug was removed. After that, washing was carried out
several times to remove any unattached drug. The nanoconjugate was
then dried and stored for further use. For all characterizations,
we dissolve the nanoconjugate in ethanol.

Characterization
A transmission electron microscope
(TEM) having model JEOL-TEM-2100F was used for the morphological study
of as synthesized nanoparticles. A UV–vis spectrophotometer
(Shimadzu) and a Fluoro Max-P (HORIBA JOBIN YVON) photoluminescence
spectrophotometer were used for the optical study. A Horiba Jobin
Yvon Raman spectrometer using a helium–neon laser at an excitation
wavelength of 532 nm was used. A Shimadzu (FTIR-8300) spectrometer
was used for Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy measurements,
using KBr pellets. In time-correlated single-photon counting measurement,
the samples were excited at 375 nm using a picosecond diode laser
(NANO-LED IBH 370L) and the fluorescence decays were analyzed using
IBH DAS6 software. To analyze the fluorescence decays, the following
equation was used, P(t)67 2  here, n is the number of
discrete emissive species and b is the baseline correction
(“dc” offset). The pre-exponential factors and excited-state
fluorescence lifetimes associated with the i component
are αi and τi, respectively. The average lifetime ⟨τ⟩
for multiexponential decays was estimated using the following equation 3  where βi = αi/∑αi and βi is the
contribution of the decay component.

Photocatalytic Activity
The photocatalytic activity
of ZnO and its composite with 9AA-HCl were monitored using methylene
blue dye (MB) solution. In 100 mL of 20 μM methylene blue solution,
5 mg of particle was added, allowed to stand in dark for 30 min, and
then transferred to a photocatalytic reactor. UV light from a mercury
lamp (60 W, 365 nm) was used to irradiate the particle suspension
under constant stirring condition (at 250 rpm, 25 °C). Finite
amounts of aliquot were withdrawn at an interval of 5 min, and absorbance
was recorded at 664 nm using a UV–vis spectrophotometer. The
degradation pattern of blank dye in the absence of the catalyst was
also performed under identical condition.

Biological
Activity Study
Analysis of Antibacterial Activity of ZnO
NPs
The antibacterial
properties of the samples were determined by selecting the Gram-negative
bacterium E. coli K12. All of the experiments
were done with freshly grown overnight culture of E.
coli cells.

Determination of the Minimum
Inhibitory Concentration (MIC)
and Minimum Bactericidal Concentration (MBC) of ZnO NPs
The
MIC of an antibacterial agent for a specific bacterium is defined
as the concentration of the antibacterial agent in the growth medium
that causes the complete inhibition of bacterial growth without killing
the bacteria even after overnight incubation. MBC is the concentration
of an antimicrobial substance needed for killing 99.9% of the bacterial
population.50 The MIC and MBC values were
determined by counting the number of bacterial colonies found on a
nutrient-agar plate after 24 h of incubation at 37 °C. The detailed
procedure is as follows: the overnight grown culture of E. coli K12 was inoculated into fresh nutrient broth
(Himedia Laboratories, India) at a final concentration of 5 ×
107 cells/mL. This fresh culture was divided into different
parts (to 5 mL each) to treat with different concentrations of ZnO
NPs. All of the treated 5 mL of cultures were incubated at 37 °C
with shaking for 18 h. Cell aliquot of 100 μL was withdrawn
from each of the individual cultures, diluted, and spread over nutrient-agar
plates to assay the number of viable cells.68

Measurement of Intracellular ROS Production
The comparative
ROS production in ZnO NPs, 9AA-HCl, and the nanoconjugate-exposed
bacterial cells was estimated using the dye 2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluoresceindiacetate
(DCFH-DA). To determine the intracellular ROS, approximately 107 order of cells were treated with only ZnO NPs, only 9AA-HCl,
and ZnO NP–9AA-HCl nanoconjugate at the MIC value for 1 h (equivalent
amount with respect to ZnO NP–9AA-HCl nanoconjugate) and then
subsequently washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). DCFH-DA
(10 μM) was then added to the cells and the cells were incubated
in the dark for 30 min at 37 °C. Cells were washed twice with
PBS and analyzed by a flow cytometer (FACS Calibur; Becton Dickinson)
through the FL1-H channel. The data were plotted as histogram using
Flowing Software 2.5.1 (University of Turku). After diffusion into
the cells, the dye was deacetylated by cellular esterases to a nonfluorescent
compound, which was later oxidized by ROS into 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein
(DCF).69,70 This is a highly authentic method for the
determination of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS).
