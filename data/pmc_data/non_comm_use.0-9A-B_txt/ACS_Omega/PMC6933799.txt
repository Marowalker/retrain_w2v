Decadal trends of atmospheric ammonia (NH3) and their
potential causes were explored through the analysis of monitored data
collected at 15 sites in the United States and 7 sites in Canada.
Large percentage increases in the annual average concentration of
atmospheric NH3, for example, >100% at 6 sites and 40–100%
at 10 sites, were observed over the most recent 8–13 year period.
In contrast, a decrease or a narrow variation in NH3 emissions
was reported at the state or provincial level in both countries during
the same period. Decreased emissions of SO2 and NOx across North America in the past decade
would have reduced the chemical loss of atmospheric NH3 to form particulate NH4+. Such a chemical
mechanism was verified through regression analysis at about half of
the monitored sites, where the increasing trends in atmospheric NH3 were partially explained by the reduced NH4+. Excluding the reduced contribution from this chemical loss
to generate the adjusted annual NH3 concentration through
two approaches, no decreasing trends can be obtained to align those
in emissions at most sites, implying that other factors also contributed
to the increase in the annual NH3 concentration. Correlation
analysis results implied that enhanced drought conditions and increased
ambient temperatures also likely contributed to the increasing trend
in the annual NH3 concentration at some sites. The large
percentage increases in the annual NH3 concentration cannot
be fully explained by all the identified causes, leading to oppugning
the reality of the decrease in NH3 emissions reported across
North America in the recent decade.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Atmospheric ammonia (NH3) plays an important role in
nitrogen cycling and on ecosystem health.1,2 Excess
input of nitrogen to sensitive ecosystems can cause various negative
impacts.3 Being the most abundant alkaline
gas in the air, atmospheric NH3 can neutralize acidic species
to form secondary aerosols, which can experience long-range transport
and affect regional air quality as well as climate.4−9 A large amount of synthetic nitrogenous fertilizers used for agricultural
activities consequently increases NH3 concentrations at
various spatiotemporal scales worldwide.10−12 For example,
NH3 concentrations were nearly 1 order of magnitude higher
during fertilization periods than that during other times in agricultural
areas across southern Ontario.11 Decadal
scale increases in NH3 concentrations have also been identified
for China, Europe, the United States, and other countries using satellite
data.12

North America is one of the
most intensive NH3 emission
zones on earth.12,13 The established anthropogenic
NH3 emission inventories show that agricultural NH3 emissions exceed 80% of the total anthropogenic NH3 emissions therein.14,15 No regulations have been promulgated
to reduce NH3 emissions in North America, although decreased
NH3 emissions have been reported in most provinces in Canada
(https://pollution-waste.canada.ca/air-emission-inventory) and
states in the United States (https://www.epa.gov/air-emissions-inventories/air-emissions-sources). On the other hand, increasing trends in NH3 concentrations
have been identified from satellite observations and ground-level
measurements.2,12,16 The contrasting trends between NH3 emissions and concentrations
have not been fully explained,12,17 which hampers efforts
to accurately assess nitrogen-related impacts and make proper emission
control policies.2,18,19

The chemical mechanism that has reduced formation of particulate
ammonium (NH4+) because of emission reductions
of SO2 and NOx should theoretically reduce the chemical
loss of atmospheric NH3 and has been argued as a major
factor affecting the annual trend in atmospheric NH3.12,16,17 Climate anomalies may also affect
the trend in atmospheric NH3 to some extent because the
release of NH3 from agricultural activities not only depends
on the amount of fertilizer applied but also depends on weather conditions
during and after the fertilization period.10,20 For example, the largest NH3 emissions from fertilizer
applications and from livestock sectors were reported in May across
southern Ontario.21 However, the maximum
value of atmospheric NH3 was reportedly observed in July
at various agricultural and remote sites therein using passive samplers.11 Atmospheric NH3 has been reported
to be vulnerable to climate warming, for example, NH3 volatilization
potential from soil/vegetation systems nearly doubles with every 5
°C increase in air temperature.20,22 In the last
decade, from 2009 to 2018, 8 years were among the 10 hottest global
years on record, with 2015–2018 being ranked as the top 4 hottest
years; thus, the response of atmospheric NH3 concentrations
to climate anomalies is worth further investigation.

The present
study aims to identify long-term trends and their causes
in atmospheric NH3 at the available monitoring sites across
Canada and the United States (Tables S1 and S2). To achieve these goals, total NH3 emissions as well
as NH3 emissions from transportation and wildfire sectors
at Canadian provincial and US state levels were both analyzed along
with variations in annual NH3 concentrations. Correlations
between the annual average concentrations of NH3 and NH4+ in PM2.5 were also analyzed to elucidate
the influence of chemical conversion of NH3 to NH4+ on NH3 trends. Building on the analysis results,
the annual NH3 concentrations were adjusted by excluding
the reduced loss caused by chemical conversion of NH3 to
NH4+ through two approaches and were reexamined
for the trends. Finally, the impact of weather conditions, including
the ambient temperature and Palmer drought index (PDI), on NH3 trends was explored. Knowledge gained from this study reveals
the need to verify the reported NH3 emissions in both countries
and for continued monitoring over long time scales and at more locations.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Trends in the Annual Average Mass Concentration
of Atmospheric NH3 across the United States
An
increasing trend from 2009/2010 to 2018 was identified in the annual
average mass concentration of atmospheric NH3 at 14 out
of the 15 sites in the United States from Mann–Kendall (M–K)
and linear regression (LR) analyses at a 95% confidence level (Figures 1 and 2). No trend was found at site CO13 (a site in Colorado). The
total percentage increases during the study period exceeded 100% at
five sites, ranged from 40–100% at eight sites, and was only
∼20% at site MI96 in Michigan (Figure 1). Larger percentage increases were generally
associated with sites with lower annual NH3 concentrations
(Figure 2). For example,
five sites (SC05, MN18, NY97, OH02, and NM98) had annual NH3 concentrations lower than 1 μg m–3 (a critical
level of atmospheric NH3 for sensitive ecosystems, as reported
by Cape et al., 200923). Among these, the
largest percentage increase of >300% was observed at SC05, a remote
site in Cape Romain National Wildlife Refuge, South Carolina, with
the annual NH3 concentration increasing from 0.09 μg
m–3 in 2009 to 0.4 μg m–3 in 2018. An ∼200% increase was observed at MN18 in Minnesota
and NY67 in New York, followed by an ∼120% increase at OH02
in Ohio and only an ∼60% increase at NM98 in New Mexico.

NH3 concentrations at each sampling site and percentage

state or province reported across North America (0 represents no decreasing
or increasing trends, map is free domain).

Figure 2 Trends in the annual NH3 concentration observed
at 15
sites in the United States (dashed line represents LR results).

The annual NH3 concentrations were generally
higher
than 1 μg m–3 at the other nine American sites
(IN99, MI96, TX43, NM99, PA00, IL11, OK99, WI07, and OH27) that were
identified to have increasing trends. The percentage increases in
annual NH3 concentrations were less than 100% at all of
these sites except IN99, ∼120%. A rural site with intensive
agricultural activities (TX43 in Texas) had annual NH3 concentrations
generally exceeding 3 μg m–3. The percentage
increase at TX43 was approximately 40% from 2009 to 2018, but there
were two distinctive periods when the annual NH3 concentrations
jumped from 3.1 ± 0.2 μg m–3 (the mean
± standard deviation) in 2009–2012 to 3.9 ± 0.3 μg
m–3 in 2013–2018. However, within each of
these two periods, there were only narrow annual variations, and there
were no distinctive seasonal trends. The inflection point occurred
in 2011–2013 when NH3 concentrations showed a clear
oscillating increase, starting from a lower value of 1.0 μg
m–3 in October 2011 to a higher value of 5.4 μg
m–3 in November 2012 to January 2013 (Figure S1a). These phenomena suggest possible
increases in anthropogenic NH3 emissions during October
2011 to January 2013, and the emissions remained at high levels afterward.
Similar to what happened at TX43, large increases in annual NH3 concentrations at most of the American sites occurred after
2011–2012. However, the large increases in annual NH3 concentrations apparently continued from 2011–2012 to 2018
at these sites rather than the narrow oscillation observed at TX43
in 2013–2018.

For the site that had no clear trend (CO13),
the annual NH3 concentrations oscillated around 3.5 ±
0.4 μg
m–3 during 2009–2018 but narrowly decreased
to around 3.4 ± 0.2 μg m–3 if the two
highest values of 4.1–4.2 μg m–3 in
2013 and 2018 were excluded. These two highest annual values were
likely related to the effects of climate anomalies because the reported
NH3 emissions in CO decreased by approximately 30% from
2009 to 2017 (Figure 1). Li et al. also reported a stable annual mean value of NH3 concentrations in summer time through 2010–2015 in the northeastern
plains of Colorado.24

2.2 Trends in the Annual Average Mass Concentration
of Atmospheric NH3 across Canada
An increasing
trend in the annual average mass concentration of atmospheric NH3 was identified at three sites, that is, an urban site in
Halifax, Nova Scotia, from 2010 to 2017, an urban site in Toronto,
Ontario, from 2005 to 2017, and a rural agricultural site in Saint-Anicet,
Québec, from 2006 to 2017 (Figure 3); these were identified from M–K
and LR analyses at 95% confidence levels. A probable increasing trend
was also resolved at an urban site in downtown Ottawa from 2008 to
2017 from the M–K method with a 92% confidence level. A stable
trend at two urban sites (Metro Van Burnaby, British Columbia, and
Edmonton, Alberta) and no trend at one urban site (Saint John, New
Brunswick) in the last decade were also resolved from the M–K
method. It is interesting that an obvious increase in annual NH3 concentrations occurred in Toronto after 2011, which was
similar to what happened at most of the American sites. If the annual
NH3 concentration only during the period from 2005 to 2011
in Toronto was considered alone, no trend was resolved by the M–K
method.

Figure 3 Trends in the annual NH3 concentration observed at seven
sites in Canada (dashed line represents LR results).

The percentage increase was ∼110% from 2004
to 2017 at the
rural site in Québec, ∼80% from 2010 to 2017 in downtown
Halifax, and ∼50% from 2005 to 2017 in downtown Toronto. At
the rural site in Québec, the annual NH3 concentration
linearly increased from 0.9 μg m–3 in 2004
to 1.9 μg m–3 in 2008 and then largely oscillated
around 1.9 ± 0.3 μg m–3 during 2008–2017.
The annual NH3 concentration increased from 0.5 μg
m–3 in 2010 to 0.9 μg m–3 in 2017 in Halifax and from 1.7 μg m–3 in
2005 to 2.6 μg m–3 in 2017 in Toronto. Annual
NH3 concentrations narrowly varied around 1.3 ± 0.1
μg m–3 from 2008 to 2017 in downtown Ottawa,
1.2 ± 0.1 μg m–3 from 2006 to 2017 in
Metro Van Burnaby, and 0.3 ± 0.03 μg m–3 from 2008 to 2017 in Saint John, but they varied in a larger range
of 1.6–2.2 μg m–3 in Edmonton. Unlike
the findings at sites with low annual NH3 concentrations
in the United States, no large percentage increase in the annual NH3 concentration occurred in Saint John.

2.3 Comparison of the Trends in Atmospheric NH3 and the Reported NH3 Emissions
The discussions
above showed that when combining the U.S. and Canadian sites, 6 out
of the 22 studied sites had a percentage increase in annual NH3 concentrations exceeding 100% and 10 sites had an increase
of 40–100% in the last 8–13 years. To explore the dominant
factors causing these increases, the NH3 emission trends
reported in both countries were first examined.

The reported
state-level total NH3 emissions decreased by 30–60%
in the states of IN, MI, MN, NM, NY, and WI, and they decreased by
20–30% in the states of CO, OH, PA, and SC from 2009 to 2017
(Figure 1). Apparently,
the decreasing emission trends cannot explain the large increasing
trends in atmospheric NH3 at the sites located in these
states. The state-level total NH3 emissions narrowly oscillated,
for example, with the standard deviation over the mean of the total
annual NH3 emissions being within 2% in IL, OK, and TX
from 2009 to 2017. Again, such emission trends were not consistent
with the 40–50% increase in the annual NH3 concentrations
measured at IL11, TX 43, and OK99.

NH3 emissions
from transportation have been considered
an important source of atmospheric NH3 in urban environments,
as reviewed by Behera et al. (2013),10 although
this has been argued by others.25,26 Annual NH3 emissions from transportation were reported to have decreased by
10–40% from 2009 to 2017 in the above-mentioned 13 states containing
sites with atmospheric NH3 measurements. The decreasing
emission trends cannot explain the increasing trends in atmospheric
NH3 at several urban sites (MI96, OH27, and NM99).

NH3 emissions from wildfires are an important source
of atmospheric NH3 in remote and rural environments.27 Emissions from this source were expected to
be higher in drought years than in ordinary years, such as in 2011
when one of the worst droughts occurred in NM, TX, and CO (Figure S2). The reported annual NH3 emissions from the wildfires in NY, OH, and PA increased greatly
from 2010/2011 to 2014 and then remained nearly constant during 2014–2017.
However, those in MN showed a large decrease from 2011 to 2014 and
then remained low during 2014–2017. The patterns of the annual
NH3 emissions from wildfires in these states were clearly
inconsistent with the increasing trends in atmospheric NH3 monitored at respective remote/rural sites.

Similar to the
case in the United States, provincial level total
NH3 emissions reportedly decreased in eastern Canada, for
example, an approximately 10% decrease from 2009 to 2017 in Nova Scotia,
20% from 2004 to 2017 in Ontario, and 10% from 2003 to 2017 in Québec
(Figure 1). NH3 emissions from transportation had also reportedly decreased
in the last decade in Canada, for example, an approximately 10% decrease
in Nova Scotia from 2009 to 2017 and 40% decreases from 2004 to 2017
in Ontario and from 2003 to 2017 in Québec (figure not shown).
The decreasing trends in NH3 emissions from transportation
were clearly unable to explain the increasing or probable increasing
trends in atmospheric NH3 at several urban sites (Halifax,
Toronto, and Ottawa) in Canada. The large oscillation in annual NH3 around 1.9 ± 0.3 μg m–3 during
2008–2017 at the agricultural site in Québec was likely
caused by perturbations in NH3 emissions regulated by weather
conditions, as discussed below. However, drivers of the linear increase
in the annual NH3 concentration from 0.9 μg m–3 in 2004 to 1.9 μg m–3 in
2008 at the same site have not been identified.

2.4 Impact of NH4+ Chemistry
on the Increased Annual NH3 Concentrations
2.4.1 Increase in Atmospheric NH3 Related
to Decreasing NH4+ in PM2.5
Decreases in emissions of SO2 and NOx, followed by reduced chemical conversion of NH3 to ammonium salts in atmospheric particles, have been widely debated
as one of the major mechanisms causing the differing trends between
atmospheric NH3 and NH3 emissions.12,17,28−32 If this mechanism is the dominant factor controlling
the NH3 trend, then any increased annual NH3 concentration should be reflected in the reduced annual NH4+ concentration. Correlation analyses between the annual
NH3 and NH4+ concentrations were
thus conducted below at the studied sites in the United States and
Canada to reveal the extent that this chemical process contributed
to the increased annual NH3 concentrations.

In the
United States, no NH4+ in PM2.5 data
were available at 6 out of the 15 sites (TX43, OH02, NY67, CO13, NM98,
and NM99). The annual NH4+ appeared to be highly
homogeneous at a regional scale in the state of NM (Figure S3a). Thus, NH4+ data at the
nearby sites were used for NM98 and NM99. Correlation analyses between
annual concentrations of NH4+ and NH3 were thus conducted at 11 sites. These sites were grouped into three
categories based on the obtained determination coefficients and slopes
from the regression. In category 1, moderately good correlations (R2 = 0.59–0.84, P <
0.05) between annual concentrations of NH4+ and
NH3 were indeed obtained at seven sites (SC05, PA00, IL11,
WI07, IN99, MI96, and OH27) with the regression slopes being close
to −1.0 (−0.5 to −0.7, Figure 4). In this case, it can be safely assumed
that the reduced chemical loss of atmospheric NH3 was likely
a major contributor to the increased annual NH3 concentration.
Slopes shallower than −1.0 ones in these regressions were likely
due to the longer residence time of NH4+ in
PM2.5 compared to that of NH3 in the ambient
air through atmospheric removal processes. In category 2 (NM98), the
correlation was significant with P < 0.05, but
the slope (−2.7) was much steeper than −1.0, implying
that the reduced chemical loss of atmospheric NH3 may be
a minor contributor to the increased annual NH3 concentration.
In category 3 (NM99, MN18, and OK99), no significant correlations
can be obtained, implying that other factors may overwhelm the reduced
chemical loss of atmospheric NH3 in contributing to the
increased annual NH3 concentration.

Figure 4 Correlations between
atmospheric NH3 and NH4+ in PM2.5 at 11 sites in the United States
(dashed line represents LR results).

In Canada, moderately good correlations (R2 = 0.50–0.59, P <
0.05) between
the annual concentrations of NH4+ and NH3 were also obtained in Toronto and Halifax, with the regression
slopes being −0.77 to −1.1 (Figure 5), suggesting that the reduced chemical loss
of atmospheric NH3 was likely a major contributor to the
increased annual NH3 concentration. No significant correlation
existed in Saint-Anicet and Ottawa with P > 0.1
(Figure 5), implying
that
other factors overwhelmed the reduced chemical loss of atmospheric
NH3 in contributing to the increased annual NH3 concentration. The same can be said at the other three Canadian
sites with R2 < 0.1 and P > 0.05 between the annual concentrations of NH4+ and NH3 (figure not shown).

atmospheric NH3 and NH4+ in PM2.5 at four sites in Canada (dashed
line represents LR results).

2.4.2 Trends in Atmospheric NH3 with
Reduced Chemical Loss Being Deducted
To explore to what extent
the reduced chemical losses contributed to the increased annual NH3 concentrations, the trends in the adjusted annual NH3 concentrations were reexamined after deducting the portions
caused by the reduced chemical losses at several American sites. Two
slightly different approaches were used herein. In the first approach,
the 1:1 ratio was used to estimate the maximum potential concentration
increase in atmospheric NH3 caused by the decreased NH4+ formation. This approach is theoretically equivalent
to extracting the trend in concentrations of annual NH3 plus annual NH4+ in PM2.5, by assuming
spatial homogeneity of annual NH4+ over a regional
scale.33 For example, taking 2009 as the
base year for site OH27, any net decrease in the annual NH4+ concentration in future years relative to that in 2009
was assumed to increase the annual NH3 concentration equivalently.
Such an approach should represent the maximum potential contribution
from the reduced chemical loss to the increased annual NH3 concentration, as explained above for the results presented in Figure 4. Using this approach,
the adjusted annual NH3 concentration in each year was
then estimated as the original annual value minus the reduced chemical
loss. The adjusted annual NH3 concentrations at OH27 showed
a stable trend as resolved from the M–K method (Figure 6), in contrast to the trend
of the reported NH3 emissions, which decreased by approximately
30% in OH. At the other 10 sites, the adjusted annual NH3 concentrations showed stable trends at MN18, PA00, WI07, OK99, and
MI96, no trend at NM98 and IN99, an increasing trend at NM99, and
a likely decreasing trend at IL11 (figure not shown). Most of the
adjusted annual NH3 concentrations at SC05 had negative
values (Figure S4a), suggesting that this
approach indeed overestimated the contribution of the reduced chemical
loss to the increased NH3 concentration.

Figure 6 (a) Annual averages of
atmospheric NH3 at OH27 and NH4+ in
PM2.5 at 390610040 in Ohio. (b)
Adjusted annual averages of atmospheric NH3 at OH27 and
NH3 emissions in Ohio. * and ** indicate the adjusted annual
averages based on approaches 2 and 1, respectively.

Thus, the second approach was designed to estimate
the contribution
of the reduced chemical loss to the increased NH3 concentration
more accurately than the first approach does. In this approach, the
cumulative effect of chemical loss was considered based on the available
data, as detailed below. Taking site OH27 as the first example, the
annual NH4+ concentration at a nearby site (ID:
390610040, Table S3) a few kilometers away
from OH27 experienced a two-phase decrease during the period of 2009–2016,
that is, 1.6 ± 0.03 μg m–3 in 2009–2011,
1.0 ± 0.09 μg m–3 in 2012–2015,
and 0.5 μg m–3 in 2016 (Figure 6a). The two-phase decreases were also clearly
observed at another site (ID: QUCI1, Table S3) situated in the same state (Ohio) but several hundred kilometers
away from OH27, that is, 1.4 ± 0.05 μg m–3 in 2009–2011, 1.1 ± 0.04 μg m–3 in 2012–2015, and 0.7 ± 0.01 μg m–3 in 2016–2018 (Figure S3c). Thus,
it can be assumed that the two-phase decreases in the annual NH4+ concentration occurred on a regional scale covering
site OH27. Using 2011 and 2012 as base years, the increase in NH3 in 2012 against 2011 was assumed to be completely caused
by the reduced chemical loss, which apparently represents the upper
limit estimation. The increased NH3 in future years (expressed
as Δ[NH3]x, with x being the year of 2013, 2014, and so on) that can be attributed
to the reduced chemical loss can then be estimated as  

The NH3 concentrations at
OH27 and the NH4+ concentrations at site 390610040
were applied to the
above equation.

Based on the consistent trend in annual NH4+ concentrations from 2009 to 2016 at sites 390610040
and QUCI1 and
the almost constant annual NH4+ concentrations
at QUCI1 during 2016–2018, it can be reasonably assumed that
the chemical losses of atmospheric NH3 at OH27 in 2017
and 2018 were the same as that in 2016. The adjusted annual NH3 concentrations at OH27 after deducing Δ[NH3]x are shown in Figure 6b. M–K and LR analysis results showed
an increasing trend at a 99% confidence level, with an approximately
60% increase overall from 2009 to 2018. This approach is theoretically
equivalent to extracting the trend in concentrations of annual NH3 plus γ* annual NH4+ in PM2.5, where γ is a coefficient between 0 and 1 and reflects
the cumulative effect of chemical loss due to different deposition
rates of atmospheric NH3 and particulate NH4+.

In the same state, there is another site (OH02)
with monitored
atmospheric NH3 data but without nearby NH4+ data. Based on our previous findings, it still can be reasonably
assumed that the values of ([NH3]2012 –
[NH3]2011) and ([NH3]2016 – [NH3]2015) were completely due to
the reduced chemical loss. The reduced chemical loss in each year
of 2012–2015 was assumed to be equal to ([NH3]2012 – [NH3]2011), while the reduced
chemical loss in each year of 2016–2018 was assumed to be equal
to the sum of ([NH3]2012 – [NH3]2011) and ([NH3]2016 – [NH3]2015). The adjusted annual NH3 concentrations
also exhibited an increasing trend with an approximately 80% overall
increase from 2009 to 2018 (Figure S4b).
The trends in the adjusted NH3 concentrations at both OH27
and OH02 implied a 60–80% increase in NH3 emissions
in Ohio during 2009–2018, as opposed to the officially reported
30% decreases. Underestimation in the NH3 emissions was
a common phenomenon globally.13

Using
the second approach, increasing trends were also identified
in the adjusted annual NH3 concentrations at IN99 and SC05,
with the former site having an approximate 90% increase and the latter
site having an ∼260% increase from 2009 to 2018 at a ≥95%
confidence level (Figure S4b). Again, these
percentage increases in NH3 concentrations were inconsistent
with the reported 20–40% decreases in NH3 emissions
in the respective U.S. states containing the considered sites. Note
that the second approach cannot be applied to sites with larger annual
NH3 concentrations in 2011 than those in 2012 or at sites
with no distinctive two-phase decreases in annual NH4+ concentrations.

2.5 Increases in the Annual NH3 Concentration
Related to Weather Conditions
Because of a lack of soil and
vegetation surface temperature data, ambient temperature is used alternatively
for the analysis. The increase in ambient temperature would theoretically
increase NH3 emissions from the soil and vegetation,24,25,34 especially in the top four hottest
years on record. When the annual NH3 concentration was
correlated with the annual ambient temperature (Figure 7), a significant correlation was obtained
only at OH02 (R2 = 0.57, P < 0.05), OH27 (R2 = 0.45, P < 0.05), and SC05 (R2 =
0.57, P < 0.05; figure not shown). No correlation
was found at the other sites, likely because other factors combined
were dominant over the surface temperature in regulating ambient NH3, including emissions from soil and vegetation.12,24,25,35 A good exponential correlation between the atmospheric NH3 and ambient temperature (roughly representing the surface temperature
with a few hour delay) may only exist in short time periods when other
factors are weak, as reported in Hu et al. (2014)25 and Teng et al. (2017).26 The
ambient temperature not only affects NH3 emissions but
also affects the gas–aerosol partitioning of NH3/NH4+.36,37

Figure 7 Correlations of the annual
averages of atmospheric NH3 at OH02 and OH27 with either
ambient temperature (a) or PDI data
(b).

Recently, Warner et al. (2017) proposed that droughts
led to increases
in the annual NH3 concentration on the basis of satellite
NH3 data and the ground-level drought index.12 However, Teng et al. (2017) reported a large
drop in concentrations of atmospheric NH3 during several
dry days with water vapor below 3000 ppm and a positive correlation
between NH3 concentrations and water vapor during many
short time periods—from several hours to days.26 In a laboratory experiment, the release of reactive nitrogen
gases decreased to a negligible level when the soil was dried.38 One explanation of the controversy between the
above-mentioned studies is the different time scales focused in different
studies. To explain the annual trend on a decadal scale, it is better
to compare the annual NH3 concentration with annual drought
data, such as that from PDI.

PDI has been widely used to quantify
drought severity in the United
States (Table S4). Drought usually occurs
regionally, and it can be reasonably assumed that PDI at one site
represents the regional drought extent. A significant negative correlation
between the annual NH3 and PDI was obtained at OH02 (R2 = 0.40 or 0.78 with one outlier in 2018 being
excluded; Figure 7b)
and at NM98 if the outlier in 2012 was excluded (R2 = 0.58; Figure 8c). Thus, the influence of droughts on the annual NH3 concentration appeared to be a minor factor on a decadal scale at
most of the sites, although it can be the dominant one at a few sites.
For example, the strongest spike of atmospheric NH3 at
NM98 occurred in July 2014, the year in which PDI exhibited a large
negative deviation from the decadal average (Figure 8a,b), but no spike was observed in July 2015,
the year in which PDI exhibited a large positive deviation from the
decadal average.

Figure 8 Temporal variation in atmospheric NH3 at NM
98 (a),
weekly variations in PDI in different years and decade average (b),
and correlations between annual averages of atmospheric NH3 and PDI data at NM98 (c).

A hypothesis is thereby proposed to explain the
contradictory results
of atmospheric NH3 related to droughts between the event
and annual time scales. Extreme drought very likely restrains the
release of NH3 from soil and vegetation to the atmosphere
because the release is strongly driven by water evaporation.25,26 However, extreme droughts may lead to the accumulation of NH4+ in the surface soil layer because of the reduced
loss by water runoff. NH3 can then be explosively released
from the soil, as induced by occasional precipitation at time scales
of minutes to hours, which consequently leads to a higher annual NH3 concentration.

Weather conditions are also expected
to regulate the explosive
release of NH3 from fertilizer applications because of
the effects of the ambient temperature on water evaporation, the degradation
rate of urine, etc. For example, at Saint-Anicet, Québec, large
increases in atmospheric NH3 (e.g., with the daily average
reaching approximately 30 μg m–3) were observed
in most years from 2006 to 2014, but not in the other years (Figure S1b). A value higher than 80 μg
m–3 was observed at the site on October 23, 2010,
and another spike higher than 10 μg m–3 was
again observed on November 4, 2010, corresponding to the fall fertilizing
season in Canada. Such high values likely resulted from explosive
releases of NH3 from fertilization applications. There
were also many summer spikes at magnitudes of <10 μg m–3, likely from the release of the residual spring fertilization.11

3 Methodology
Monitoring sites having
at least 8 years of atmospheric NH3 data were selected
in this study (Tables S1 and S2, Figure 1). Daily (one in every three days) mass concentrations of
atmospheric NH3 at seven Canadian sites were downloaded
from the National Air Pollution Surveillance (NAPS, http://maps-cartes.ec.gc.ca/rnspa-naps/data.aspx?lang=en) network, and biweekly mass concentrations of atmospheric NH3 at 15 sites in the United States were downloaded from the
Passive Ammonia Monitoring Network (AMoN, http://nadp.slh.wisc.edu/AMoN/). Simultaneous measurements of NH4+ mass concentrations
in PM2.5 and meteorological data at the Canadian NAPS sites
were also downloaded to facilitate the analysis. Concentrations of
NH4+ in PM2.5 at IMPROVE sites and
Environmental Protection Agency sites in the United States (http://vista.cira.colostate.edu/Improve/) were also used because of the lack of simultaneous measurements
of NH4+ in PM2.5 at some of the AMoN
sites. The weather data, including the PDI, ambient temperature, and
precipitation, were downloaded as well (http://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/analysis_monitoring/cdus/palmer_drought/). NH3 emission data at the provincial level in Canada
were obtained from https://pollution-waste.canada.ca/air-emission-inventory/, and those at state level in the United States were obtained from https://www.epa.gov/air-emissions-inventories/air-pollutant-emissions-trends-data.

The starting month and year for NH3 monitoring
varied
with each site (Tables S1 and S2). To obtain
the longest time series for the annual average mass concentrations
of atmospheric NH3, a 1 year period was chosen from June
to the following May at most Canadian NAPS sites and from September
to the following August at most American sites, in lieu of using a
calendar year. More details on the data can be obtained from the aforementioned
websites and previous studies.16,17,39 Information on the NH4+ sampling sites in
the United States is listed in Table S3.

Annual NH3 concentrations are used for generating
trends.
For any given site with a significant trend in atmospheric NH3, the total percentage increase between the start and end
year is calculated, taking the start year as the base. The percentage
decrease in NH3 emissions in each province or state is
calculated in the same way. The M–K analysis tool has been
widely used for trend analysis and is also used in the present study.
The method can resolve qualitative trends including “an increasing/decreasing
trend with a P value of <0.05”, “a
probable increasing/decreasing trend with a P value
of 0.05–0.1”, “a stable trend with a P value of >0.1 and a ratio of <1.0 between the standard
deviation and the mean of the data set”, and “no trend
for all the other conditions”.16,40 Using the
Sen’s slope, it can yield a quantitative result. LR analysis
was also conducted to support the M–K analysis results.
