A phthaloyl-protected
aminooxymethyl-C-2′-deoxyriboside
building block has been prepared and incorporated in the middle of
an oligodeoxyribonucleotide. Removal of the phthaloyl protection followed
by on-support oximation with either mercurated or palladated benzaldehydes
yielded oligonucleotides bearing the respective benzaldoxime metallacycles.

Introduction
Oligonucleotides functionalized
with transition metal ions are
studied intensively for potential applications in DNA nanotechnology1−4 as well as diagnostics and chemotherapy.5−8 Such structures are typically
obtained through coordination of the desired metal ion to a high-affinity
ligand within the oligonucleotide. We, on the other hand, have recently
become interested in an alternative approach in which the metal ion
is held in place by an organometallic bond formed by postsynthetic
metalation of an oligonucleotide, incorporating an appropriate “hot
spot” in a solution.9 The main advantage
of this strategy is that the organometallic complex resists dissociation
even at extreme dilution, widening the scope of metal ions usable
in intracellular applications from the kinetically inert Pt(II) and
Ru(II) to more labile ones, such as Pd(II) and Hg(II). For example,
the high thermodynamic stability of kinetically labile metal-mediated
base pairs2,3 could be harnessed to promote hybridization
of therapeutic oligonucleotides with their target sequences.10 A notable disadvantage is that the formation
of carbon–metal bonds often requires conditions hardly compatible
with the solubility or chemical stability of oligonucleotides. Even
when the metalation is achieved under sufficiently mild conditions,
the removal of excess free transition metal ions from the product
mixture can present a problem.

Herein, we describe the synthesis
of a modified oligonucleotide
containing an aminooxymethyl-functionalized residue for the introduction
of diverse organometallic complexes through oxime coupling on a solid
support. A deoxyribose scaffold bearing the aminooxymethyl function
on its β face was chosen so that the resulting benzaldoxime
metallacycles would resemble natural nucleosides, allowing high-affinity
metal-mediated base pairing with a complementary oligonucleotide.
For the same reason, the sequences flanking the metallacyclic residue
were the same as in our previous studies on metal-mediated base pairing.11,12 The method described effectively removes the limitations on the
reaction conditions used in the preparation of the organometallic
complex. Furthermore, the use of oximation for the introduction of
conjugate groups to oligonucleotides is well established13 and should proceed predictably, exhibiting little
dependence on the structure of the organometallic complex. Finally,
any excess reagent is conveniently removed by washing the solid support
with appropriate solvents. The utility of the method has been demonstrated
with one arylmercury(II) compound and one arylpalladium(II) compound.

Results
and Discussion
Synthesis of the phthaloyl-protected aminooxy
sugar 1 and the corresponding phosphoramidite building
block 2 is described in Scheme 1. First, lactone 3 was transformed
to the corresponding
lactol 4 by treatment with DIBAL-H, as described previously.14 The reaction with vinyl magnesium bromide then
provided compound 5 as a mixture of two diastereomers
((5R)-5 and (5S)-5). Chromatographic separation of the desired diastereomer
(5S)-5 followed by mesyl chloride-promoted
ring closure afforded the β-vinyl C-glycoside 6. Synthesis of an analogous compound with tert-butyldiphenylsilyl, rather than tert-butyldimethylsilyl,
protections by the same pathway has been described in the literature.15 The desired β-stereochemistry was confirmed
by a 1D NOESY experiment, where irradiation of the anomeric proton
(H1) at 4.58 ppm lead to a single positive NOE enhancement at 4.35
ppm, corresponding to H4 (Figure S1, spectra
presented in the Supporting Information).

Scheme 1 Synthesis of Aminooxy Sugar 1 and the Corresponding
Phosphoramidite Building Block 2
Reagents and conditions: (a)
DIBAL-H, THF, −78 °C, 1 h; (b) C2H3MgBr, THF, 0 °C, 4 h; (c) MsCl, pyridine, CH2Cl2, −25 °C, 12 h; (d) (i) RuCl3, NaIO4, CeCl3, MeCN, EtOAc, H2O, 25 °C,
10 min; (ii) NaIO4, THF, H2O, Et2O, 25 °C, 90 min; (e) NaBH4, EtOH, Et2O, 25 °C, 3 h; (f) MsCl, pyridine, CH2Cl2, 25 °C, 3 h; (g) Et3N·3HF, THF, 25 °C,
16 h; (h) HONPhth, DIPEA, DMF, 70 °C, 30 h; (i) DMTrCl, pyridine,
25 °C, 12 h; and (j) 2-cyanoethyl-N,N-diisopropylchlorophosphoramidite, Et3N, CH2Cl2, N2 atmosphere, 25 °C, 2 h.

RuO4 (generated in situ from RuCl3)-catalyzed
dihydroxylation of the vinyl group to a vicinal diol16 followed by oxidative cleavage with NaIO4 gave
the formyl C-glycoside 7 in excellent
yield. Based on 1H and 13C NMR spectra, the
product was identical to the authentic compound reported previously,17 further confirming the stereochemical assignment
of the two diastereomers of compound 5. Aldehyde 7 was then reduced to the corresponding alcohol 8 by treatment with NaBH4, and the newly created hydroxy
function was mesylated to give compound 9. The hydroxy
functions at positions 4 and 6, in turn, were desilylated by treatment
with Et3N·3HF to yield intermediate 10, which was further converted to the phthaloyl-protected aminooxy
sugar 1 by nucleophilic displacement of the mesylate
leaving group with an N-hydroxyphthalimide anion.
It is worth pointing out that attempts to introduce the phthaloyl-protected
aminooxy group to intermediate 8 by the Mitsunobu reaction
failed, even though various reagent combinations were used. Similarly,
the reaction between the protected mesylate 9 and N-hydroxyphthalimide afforded only traces of the desired
product, the main product being a monodesilylated mesylate. Finally,
the primary hydroxy group was protected as a 4,4′-dimethoxytrityl
ether to give compound 11, and the secondary one was
phosphitylated with 2-cyanoethyl-N,N-diisopropylchlorophosphoramidite to give the protected phosphoramidite
building block 2.

To demonstrate functionalization
with organometallic complexes,
an oligonucleotide incorporating a single phthaloyl-protected aminooxy
sugar in the middle of the chain was first assembled on an automated
DNA synthesizer by the standard phosphoramidite protocol using an
extended coupling time (600 s) for incorporation of the phosphoramidite
building block 2. Normal (>99%) coupling yields were
obtained throughout the synthesis. Selective removal of the phthaloyl
protection was achieved by treatment with a mixture of hydrazine hydrate,
pyridine, and acetic acid, as described previously (Scheme 2).18 Immediately after liberation of the aminooxy function, the support-bound
oligonucleotide was immersed in a solution of either acetato(2-formyl-6-hydroxyphenyl)mercury
(12) in DMSO or bromo(2-formylphenyl)bis(triphenylphosphine)palladium
(13) in CH2Cl2. These organometallic
complexes were prepared as described previously.19,20 The mixtures were shaken for 12 h at 25 °C, after which the
solid supports were washed with appropriate solvents, and the oligonucleotide
products were deprotected and released by treatment with a mixture
of aqueous MeNH2 and NH3 at 65 °C. A short
treatment of only 10 min was used to avoid demetalation of the organomercury
or organopalladium residue. Finally, the modified oligonucleotides ON1-Hg and ON1-Pd thus obtained were purified
by RP-HPLC and characterized by ESI-TOF-MS.

Scheme 2 Synthesis of the
Organomercury and Organopalladium Oligonucleotides ON1-Hg and ON1-Pd
Reagents and conditions: (a)
H2NNH2, AcOH, pyridine, 25 °C, 45 min;
(b) 12, DMSO, 25 °C, 12 h; (c) 13,
CH2Cl2, 25 °C, 12 h; and (d) MeNH2, NH3, H2O, 65 °C, 10 min.

The mass spectra of ON1-Hg and ON1-Pd corresponded to the expected structures, showing incorporation of
exactly one Hg(II) ion and one Pd(II) ion, respectively. On the other
hand, no exchangeable ligands of the metal centers could be detected.
In ON1-Pd, the oxime nitrogen probably occupies one coordination
site. While oxime coupling can yield both E and Z isomers of the C=N bond, ortho-palladated benzaldoximes have invariably been reported as palladacycles
with the oxygen and the phenyl carbon trans to each
other and the nitrogen coordinated to palladium.21−23 Hg(II) tends
to form linear complexes, but weak N–Hg bonds in organomercury
complexes similar to the one in ON1-Hg have nonetheless
been proposed based on X-ray crystallographic evidence.24 Possible candidates for the remaining ligands
(one in ON1-Hg and two in ON1-Pd) include
methylamine and ammonia used for deprotection of the oligonucleotides
as well as the HPLC buffer components triethylamine and acetate ion.
With ON1-Pd, the presence of a triphenylphosphine ligand
was ruled out by 31P NMR (spectrum presented in the Supporting Information).

Conclusions
In
summary, we have developed a method for the preparation of covalently
metalated oligonucleotides through oxime coupling between aminooxy-functionalized
oligonucleotides and organometallic benzaldehyde derivatives. The
scope of the method has been demonstrated with Hg(II) and Pd(II) but,
in all likelihood, can be expanded to other metals. The most important
improvement compared to previously reported methods is that the metalation
conditions are not limited by the solubility or chemical stability
of oligonucleotides. The metal as well as the organic ligand can be
easily varied without the need to synthesize new phosphoramidite building
blocks. We therefore believe that our method will enable rapid synthesis
of previously unattainable metalated oligonucleotides.

Experimental
Section
General Information
All experiments involving air-
and/or moisture-sensitive compounds were performed using oven-dried
glassware under an argon atmosphere. For the preparation of HPLC elution
buffers, freshly distilled triethylamine was used. Other commercially
available chemicals were used without further purification, unless
otherwise stated. The solvents for organic synthesis were of reagent
grade and were dried over 4 Å molecular sieves. All reactions
were monitored by thin-layer chromatography (TLC), performed on Merck
60 (silica gel F254) plates. Chromatographic purification of products
was accomplished using flash column chromatography on a silica gel
(230–400 mesh). 1H, 13C, and 31P NMR spectra were recorded in deuterated solvents on Bruker Biospin
500 and 600 MHz NMR spectrometers. Chemical shifts (δ, ppm)
are quoted relative to the residual solvent peak as an internal standard.
Mass spectra were recorded on a Bruker micrOTOF-Q ESI mass spectrometer.

Oligonucleotide Synthesis
The modified oligonucleotide
scaffold was assembled on an Applied Biosystems Incorporated 3400
automated DNA/RNA synthesizer by a conventional phosphoramidite strategy.
The exocyclic amino functions of adenine, cytosine, and guanine bases
were protected by the standard acyl-protecting groups (benzoyl, acetyl,
and isobutyryl, respectively). For the phthaloyl-protected aminooxy-C-deoxyriboside phosphoramidite building block 2, the coupling time was extended to 600 s. The support-bound oligonucleotide
was then treated with a mixture of H2NNH2·H2O, pyridine, and AcOH (1:32:8, v/v) for 45 min. The support
was washed subsequently with pyridine, methanol, and acetonitrile
and dried under vacuum. The support-bound oligonucleotide was placed
in two microcentrifuge tubes (approximately 0.25 μmol each),
and a solution of either acetato(2-formyl-6-hydroxyphenyl)mercury19 (12, 10 μmol) in dry DMSO
(100 μL) or bromo(2-formylphenyl)bis(triphenylphosphine)palladium20 (13, 10 μmol) in dry CH2Cl2 (200 μL) was added. Note that the organomercury
compound 12 is potentially highly toxic and should be
handled appropriately. The resulting mixtures were shaken for 12 h
at 25 °C. The solutions were discarded, and the solid supports
were washed with either DMSO or CH2Cl2 and then
treated with a mixture of methylamine and 25% aqueous ammonia (1:1,
v/v) for 10 min at 65 °C. The solutions were recovered and evaporated
to dryness, and the crude products thus obtained were purified by
RP-HPLC on a Hypersil ODS C18 column (250 × 4.6 mm, 5 μm),
eluting with a linear gradient (10 to 30% over 30 min for ON1-Hg and 5 to 30% over 30 min for ON1-Pd; flow rate = 1.0
mL min–1) of MeCN in 50 mM aq triethylammonium acetate.
Detection was performed by UV absorbance at λ = 260 nm. Finally,
the purified oligonucleotides were characterized by ESI-TOF-MS and
quantified spectrophotometrically using an implementation of the nearest
neighbors method. Isolated yields of oligonucleotides ON1-Hg and ON1-Pd were approximately 1 and 11%, respectively.
The low yields stem from general difficulties in the chromatographic
purification of covalently metalated oligonucleotides and is not an
inherent property of the method reported in the present study. In
particular with covalently mercurated oligonucleotides, ligand exchange
of Hg(II) causes severe broadening of the peaks, making isolation
of the oligonucleotide in a high yield challenging. Efforts to improve
the purification methods for covalently metalated oligonucleotides
are underway in our laboratory.

NaIO4 (379 mg, 1.77 mmol) and CeCl3·7H2O (88.0 mg, 0.236 mmol) were taken in
a 10 mL round-bottom flask. H2O (0.54 mL) was added, and
