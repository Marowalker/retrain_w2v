Magnetic
nanocomposite particle (MNP)-induced hyperthermia therapy
has been restricted by inefficient cellular targeting. pH-responsive
charge-conversional MNPs can enhance selective cellular uptake in
acidic cells like tumors by sensing extracellular acidity based on
their charge alteration. We have synthesized new, pH-induced charge-conversional,
superparamagnetic, and single-cored Fe3O4 nanocomposite
particles coated by N-itaconylated chitosan (NICS)
cross-linked with ethylene glycol diglycidyl ether (EGDE) (Fe3O4-NICS-EGDE) using a simple, one-step chemical
coprecipitation–coating process. The surface of the Fe3O4-NICS-EGDE nanocomposite particles was modified
with ethanolamine (EA) via aza-Michael addition to enhance their buffering
capacity, aqueous stability, and pH sensitivity. The designed Fe3O4-NICS-EGDE-EA nanocomposite particles showed
pH-dependent charge-conversional properties, colloidal stability,
and excellent hemocompatibility in physiological media. By contrast,
the charge-conversional properties enabled microwave-induced hemolysis
only under weakly acidic conditions. Therefore, the composite particles
are highly feasible for magnetically induced and targeted cellular
thermotherapeutic applications.

1 Introduction
Magnetic
nanocomposite particles (MNPs) have been an attractive
subject in nanotechnology and biomedicine because of their unique
and promising properties. More specifically, iron oxide (Fe3O4 and Fe2O3) nanocomposite particles
have been applied extensively in biomedical applications, such as
diagnostic contrast agents for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI),1−8 positron emission tomography,3 single-photon
emission computed tomography,4 drug and
gene delivery,9−29 blood detoxification,30 and magnetic
hyperthermia therapy for tumors.18,24−26,31−43 Most antitumor drugs still present many limitations, including poor
solubility, short circulation kinetics, insufficient selectivity between
malignant and healthy cells, and decreasing immune responses, causing
adverse side effects.11 MNPs may offer
a solution by enhancing selectivity toward target cells. Tumor cells
are more vulnerable to elevated temperature because of their holey
vasculature, excessive cell proliferative hypoxia, and higher lymphatic
drainage compared to normal tissues.42 Therefore,
killing cancer cells by hyperthermia method is an efficient method,
as it is considered as a stand-alone and minimally invasive approach
for tumor ablation.33 Magnetic hyperthermia
has already been proved for therapeutic efficacy in clinical trials.40,41 It can indirectly boost the native antitumor immune responses34 and also enhance the efficacy of other treatment
methods, such as chemo- and radiation therapies.31,32 In conventional magnetic hyperthermia, magnetic nanomaterials, such
as iron oxide nanocomposites, are exposed to electromagnetic radiation
sources, such as microwave (MW), or an alternating magnetic field
(AMF) to generate heat. Heat is evolved through three mechanisms,
hysteresis loss, Brownian relaxation, and Néel relaxation,
depending on the size and concentration of the composites, heat capacity
of the dispersion medium, and the frequency of the applied radiation.33 The produced heat is transferred very quickly
to the adjacent materials, but stays locally due to the low heat-transfer
capacity of physiological fluids, such as blood, lymph, and intracellular
fluids, resulting in highly focused heating.35,36 However, unspecific and inadequate delivery of MNPs induces severe
side effects, sublethal temperature changes, resistance in malignant
cells, and damage to healthy cells.37

To address these issues, various methodologies have been developed.7 Recently, it has been reported that targeted
MNPs can generate ultrasound waves by their mechanical oscillation
in a nonhomogeneous AMF.36,43,44 The generated intracellular ultrasound can lyse malignant cells
like magnetic hyperthermia, without showing any increment in surrounding
temperature. The external surface of MNPs is often engineered with
various tissue-interactive substances, such as peptides,45,46 small molecules,21 antibodies,6 nucleic acid aptamers,5,10,38 carbohydrates,2 and nonimmunoglobulin scaffolds.7 These
ligands can improve the interaction between the nanocomposite particles
and target cells. In another approach, PEGylated magnetic liposomes39 were fabricated by conjugating poly(ethylene
glycol) (PEG) to the liposome surface, reported to enhance the accumulation
of liposomes in tumor cells through the enhanced permeation and retention
effect facilitated by their long circulation time.13,47 However, the excessively hydrated shell of PEGylated liposomes causes
a severe problem associated with their limited cellular uptake in
targeted areas, resulting in nonselective cell heating.14,16 Strategies to improve targeting ability have introduced stimuli-responsive
(temperature, light, sound, pH, etc.) properties to magnetic materials.16−20,24−26 Among them,
pH-sensitive magnetic particles are advantageous in facileness and
targeting ability to malignant sites in acidic environments, potentially
minimizing adverse side effects associated with nontargeted areas.27 Tumors are one of the most focused targets for
pH-responsive nanoparticles16,19,22,23 because tumor tissues (pH 5.7–7.2)
and their intracellular compartments, such as endosomes (pH 5.0–6.5)
and lysosomes (pH 4.5–5.0), are more acidic in nature than
the blood stream and healthy cells (pH 7.4).27 The pH responsiveness of MNPs with charge-conversional ability may
solve the problem of traditional magnetic particles applied for hyperthermia,
whereby their concentration typically decreases very rapidly during
circulation because of the systemic clearance or uncontrolled transportation
before reaching the tumor cells.

pH-induced charge-conversional
Fe3O4 nanoparticles
with cross-linked shells were reported for hyperthermia and chemotherapy.26 Under acidic conditions, the negatively charged
nanocarriers were converted into positively charged ones and released
electrostatically bound drugs. The drug release was enhanced by AMF
for efficient cytotoxicity to tumor cells. Charge reversal magnetic
MNPs based on electrostatic interaction was also reported for pH-sensitive
drug delivery.27 Cationically modified
Fe3O4 nanoparticles were electrostatically complexed
with carboxylated dextran (Dex-COOH) to generate negatively charged
surfaces and electrostatically incorporated the drug molecules. The
electrostatic linkage was broken under low pH, and both Dex-COOH and
loaded drug were released in the nuclei of HeLa cells. High antitumor
activity with an IC50 of 0.7 μg mL–1 was attained. These studies validated that pH-induced charge-conversional
MNPs could be applied for tumor cell-targeted therapies. pH-responsive
MNPs were fabricated using various strategies,21−29 but facile approaches without the use of any surfactants and organic
solvents are highly desirable for biomedical applications. Accordingly,
we focused on a one-step chemical coprecipitation–coating method,
in which magnetic cores were synthesized by coprecipitation of their
corresponding saturated salt solution in aqueous basic medium and
the produced core-particle surface was concomitantly passivated with
pH-sensitive polymeric stabilizers. Among pH-sensitive artificial
and natural polymers, chitosan (CS) and its derivatives have been
used to functionalize MNPs because of their excellent biorelated properties.8,21,23,29 For example, CS-functionalized mesoporous MNPs were reported for
pH-responsive controlled release of an antineoplastic drug.29 CS was employed for enhancing their biocompatibility
and electrostatic loading capacity of the drug molecules. The loaded
drug was released by releasing CS under acidic pH. However, the synthetic
procedures of the composite required multiple steps, including uses
of organic solvents and surfactants. N-Naphthyl-O-dimethylmaleoyl CS-based therapeutic MNPs were designed
for pH-sensitive drug delivery and imaging for cancer.8 This material successfully targeted tumors in vivo and
was applied as an MRI contrast agent, thereby requiring a multistep
synthetic technique. Hybrid MNPs coated with maltose-modified CS (CS-Malt)
were also reported for antitumor drug delivery.21 Fe3O4 particles were prepared by
coprecipitation and coated with CS-Malt, followed by both ionic and
covalent cross-linkage with Na2SO4 and glutaraldehyde,
respectively, in reverse emulsion.

However, employing organic
solvents and surfactants in the fabrication
of some MNPs requires their careful and tedious removal for subsequent
biorelated applications. In addition, noncovalent coating of MNPs
involves problems associated with serum interaction and destabilization
during circulation. Therefore, pH-responsive charge-conversional MNPs
require further design, namely, nanosized and single-cored features,
covalent fixing, and charge conversion by pH trigger with colloidal
stability at physiological pH, and selective accumulation in acidic
environments.

In this study, we report the fabrication and characterization
of
pH-responsive charge-conversional MNPs designed for cell-targeted
therapeutic applications. We employed N-itaconylated
CS (NICS) modified by ethanolamine (EA) for a charge-conversional
and biocompatible scaffold prepared by a very simple procedure. The
MNPs are composed of a single Fe3O4 core and
covalently cross-linked NICS polymeric coating, synthesized by a facile
one-step chemical coprecipitation–coating method, followed
by EA functionalization. We confirmed their structure, pH-dependent
size, surface properties, physiological stability, hemolytic behavior,
and magnetic response. We finally tested them for their feasibility
in targeted hyperthermia therapy. The magnetic and pH-responsive properties
of these composite particles would offer spatial and temporal control
for selective targeting of acidic cells.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Synthesis and Characterization
of NICS
NICS was synthesized by partial modification of the
amino groups
of CS with itaconic anhydride (IAn) to achieve controllable aqueous
solubility and desired reactivity for further modification. The modification
proceeded through the half amidation of the anhydride moieties of
IAn, and the resulting carboxy group was readily converted into a
mono-Na-itaconate by neutralizing with NaOH aq. (Scheme 1). The resulting compound was
characterized by 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), Fourier
transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, and X-ray diffraction (XRD, Figure S1). The 1H NMR spectroscopic
data revealed that 36% of the amine moieties of the CS chain were
substituted by N-itaconyl moieties (Figure S1a). The FTIR spectrum of NICS showed the successful
incorporation of the N-itaconyl moieties to the nitrogen
of the d-glucosamine unit of CS (Figure S1b). XRD analysis (Figure S1c)
demonstrated the effect of introducing hydrophilic groups to the CS
backbone. The resulting NICS exhibited semicrystalline microstructure
with appreciable water solubility in a manner similar to that reported
for N-succinyl CS.48

2.2 Synthesis and Functionalization
of Fe3O4-NICS-EGDE Nanocomposite Particles
NICS
was applied as a template and surface modifier for Fe3O4 through a simple two-step process. The first step involves
the fabrication of nanocomposite particles of Fe3O4 and concomitant coating by NICS, followed by cross-linking
with ethylene glycol diglycidyl ether (EGDE) (Fe3O4-NICS-EGDE) via a facile chemical coprecipitation–coating
technique (Scheme 2). In this process, Fe3O4 was formed in a basic
aqueous solution of FeSO4 and FeCl3 containing
NICS via coprecipitation of Fe2+ and Fe3+ ions
and simultaneously coated by chelation of the carboxylate moieties
of NICS on the surface of Fe3O4 nanocrystals.
Coated NICS was subsequently cross-linked via the ring-opening addition
of the amine moieties of NICS to the epoxy ring of EGDE to restrict
probable escaping of Fe3O4 particles during
circulation. The resulted Fe3O4-NICS-EGDE nanocomposite
particles are unable to form highly stable dispersion in physiological
buffers because of the zwitterionic character of NICS, which contains
both the amine and carboxy moieties. The presence of alkenyl, carboxy,
hydroxy, and amine functions in a single Fe3O4-NICS-EGDE nanocomposite particle allows its easy modification by
conjugation to sensitive moieties. Specifically, the electron-deficient
alkenyl group is a highly reactive site for aza-Michael addition reaction
in aqueous media. In the second step, the Fe3O4-NICS-EGDE nanocomposite particles were modified via the aqueous
aza-Michael addition of EA to the alkenyl groups to achieve better
colloidal stability and improved pH responsiveness (Scheme 2).

2.3 Structure of Nanocomposites
The successful
fabrication of the Fe3O4-NICS-EGDE and Fe3O4-NICS-EGDE-EA nanocomposite particles was confirmed
by FTIR spectroscopy (Figure 1), energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectrometry (Figure S3), XRD (Figure S4), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, selected area
electron diffraction (Figure S5), and 1H NMR analysis of a model polymer. The FTIR spectrum of bare
Fe3O4 (Figure 1a) shows two strong absorption bands at 584 and 632
cm–1 assignable to the stretching of the Fe–O
bond in the crystalline lattice of Fe3O4, which
were also observed in the spectra of both composites. A broad signal
appearing at 3435 cm–1 is assignable to the absorption
of hydrogen-bonded O–H, indicating the fabrication of Fe3O4 in aqueous environment.49−51 In the FTIR
spectrum of Fe3O4-NICS-EGDE prepared in situ
(Figure 1b), the carbonyl
stretching absorption of carboxylate moieties originating from NICS
significantly shifted from 1382 to 1375 cm–1, indicating
the coordination of −CO2– ions
to Fe3O4.52 In addition,
two new signals with very weak intensities (shown in enlarged formats)
appearing at 3073 and 893 cm–1 are assignable to
the stretching of alkenyl C–H and the wagging of C=CH2, respectively.53 Two medium-intense
bands were also observed at 1555 and 1634 cm–1,
which are assignable to the absorption of amides I and II and C=C,
respectively.54 A very broad signal observed
in the region of 3330–3440 cm–1 is assignable
to the stretching vibration bands of O–H and N–H groups,
respectively. These results indicate that the surface of Fe3O4 was efficiently coated with NICS-EGDE. In the spectrum
of the Fe3O4-NICS-EGDE-EA nanocomposite (Figure 1c), the amide I and
II peaks appeared at higher wavenumbers (1557 and 1646 cm–1, respectively) than those in the spectrum of Fe3O4-NICS-EGDE, indicating that the α,β-unsaturated
amine moieties were transformed into saturated structures. In addition,
the intensity of the C–N and C–H stretching bands became
stronger. These results demonstrate the addition of EA to the alkenyl
moieties of Fe3O4-NICS-EGDE.

Fe3O4, (b) Fe3O4-NICS-EGDE,
and (c) Fe3O4-NICS-EGDE-EA nanocomposite particles.

The progress of EA addition to
NICS was further confirmed by a
model reaction of NICS and EA under identical conditions because the
cross-linkage and the paramagnetic character prevented the quantitative
analysis (Scheme 3).
The 1H NMR spectrum of NICS-EA shows three characteristic
peaks at 2.9, 3.4, and 3.6 ppm (Figure S2). These signals are assignable to the −CH2NCH2– and −OCH2– protons originating from the aza-Michael
addition of EA to the pendant N-itaconyl moieties.
The alkenyl protons were also observed at 5.35 and 5.75 ppm, indicating
the partial addition of EA to NICS. The percentage of EA addition
was calculated to be 27% from the integral ratio of the 1H NMR peaks of the −NCH2CH2OH and acetyl protons in NICS-EA.

2.4 Morphology
of Nanocomposites
The
bare Fe3O4, Fe3O4-NICS-EGDE,
and Fe3O4-NICS-EGDE-EA nanocomposite particles
were analyzed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM, Figure 2a–c). The TEM image
of bare Fe3O4 shows spherical particles with
an average diameter of 40 nm. As the bare Fe3O4 particles were prepared in the absence of any stabilizers, the growth
of particle was higher, resulting in aggregation compared to the in
situ prepared Fe3O4 nanocomposite particles.
Therefore, the TEM images of both composites showed similar shapes
with average diameters of 7 nm regardless of the sample due to the
control growth of particles in solution. This result indicates that
the core was not deteriorated during the coating and functionalization
process. The surface morphologies and particle sizes of the dried
Fe3O4, Fe3O4-NICS-EGDE,
and Fe3O4-NICS-EGDE-EA nanocomposite particles
were also studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Figure 2d–f). The histograms
shown in the insets indicate their size distributions. The bare Fe3O4 particles were observed as aggregates due to
the absence of any stabilizer. The average size was approximately
40 nm, but the aggregation resulted in difficulty in size calculation,
and probably resulted in overestimation. The Fe3O4-NICS-EGDE nanocomposite particles prepared in situ showed spherical
shapes with an average diameter of 21 nm and exhibited good colloidal
dispersity compared to bare Fe3O4 particles.
The Fe3O4-NICS-EGDE-EA nanocomposite particles
were also spherical in shape with an average diameter of 22 nm, and
the colloidal dispersity was better than that of the unmodified composites.
The relatively larger sizes than the TEM images originated from the
coating layers of the composites without having heavier atoms that
were not observed in the TEM images.2,52,54 The spherical morphology and the smaller size indicate
that each nanocomposite particle mostly contains a single Fe3O4 core. The quantities of the organic coatings of the
Fe3O4-NICS-EGDE and Fe3O4-NICS-EGDE-EA nanocomposite particles were estimated to be 27 and
28%, respectively, by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA, Figure S6).

(d–f) of bare Fe3O4, Fe3O4-NICS-EGDE, and

2.5 Magnetism
of Nanocomposites
The magnetic
properties of the dried, bare Fe3O4, Fe3O4-NICS-EGDE, and Fe3O4-NICS-EGDE-EA
nanocomposites were investigated by measuring their magnetization
as a function of the applied magnetic field at ambient temperature
(Figure 3). The magnetization
profiles for all samples exhibited the existence of open hysteresis
loops in their M–H curves with negligible
remanence and coercivity, suggesting that these materials are composed
of a single-domain particle with superparamagnetic properties like
typical Fe3O4.50,55 The saturation
magnetization (Ms) was calculated with
respect to the mass of Fe3O4. The Ms values of Fe3O4 cores inside Fe3O4-NICS-EGDE and Fe3O4-NICS-EGDE-EA nanocomposite particles were 80 and 78
emu g–1, respectively. These values are higher than
the Ms value of the bare Fe3O4 particles (70 emu g–1). The increment
in Ms of the nanocomposites
plausibly originated from the improvements in the uniformity in the
surface properties of the Fe3O4 coated in situ
via chemical bonding to the carboxylate moieties of NICS, as reported
for the alginic acid-coated Fe3O4 nanoparticles.56 The high Ms value
of the Fe3O4-NICS-EGDE-EA nanocomposite particles
will be advantageous for magnetic guiding applications, such as hyperthermia
therapy for cancer cells, because of the rapid response to external
magnetic fields.

Fe3O4-NICS-EGDE-EA nanocomposite particles analyzed
by vibrating sample magnetometry at room temperature. The inset indicates
a region of lower magnetic field.

2.6 Effect of pH on Size, ζ Potential, and
Colloidal Stability of Nanocomposites
The average hydrodynamic
size, ζ potential, and colloidal stability of the nanocomposites
were studied by dynamic light scattering (DLS) in Dulbecco’s
phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS) with controlled pH from 3 to 9 (as
prepared, Figure 4a–c).
The average hydrodynamic diameters were almost identical (ca. 300
nm) in the pH range of 3–5, and the particles were highly dispersible.
However, the average hydrodynamic size of the Fe3O4-NICS-EGDE-EA nanocomposite was increased significantly at
pH 5.5–6.0, resulting in gradual accumulation of the nanocomposite
particles (Figure 4d). Above pH 6, the nanocomposites again became highly dispersible.
These pH-dependent variations in size and dispersibility originated
from the charge-conversional functions of the nanocomposites that
consisted of carboxyl and amine moieties. The net electrostatic repulsions
among the individual composite particles are sufficient when they
are either cationically or anionically charged. The positive ζ
potentials at pH 3–5 indicate the predominant protonation of
the amine and carboxylate groups of the composites. In a similar manner,
the negative ζ potentials above pH 6 indicate the predominant
deprotonation of the ammonium and carboxy groups. By contrast, the
composites became almost charge-neutral in the pH range of unstable
dispersion. Under these conditions, the zwitterionic surface of the
nanocomposites were ionically cross-linked, leading to gradual aggregation.
This behavior is much stronger for the Fe3O4-NICS-EGDE-EA nanocomposite than for the unmodified Fe3O4-NICS-EGDE nanocomposite. The aggregation tendency was
further confirmed by the assembled mass in the TEM image of the Fe3O4-NICS-EGDE-EA cast from dispersion at pH 5.5
(Figure 4e), contrastive
to the SEM image indicating the dispersed particles (Figure 2f).

Figure 4 pH-dependent (a) hydrodynamic
diameter, (b) ζ potential,
(c, d) aqueous stability, and (e) TEM image of Fe3O4-NICS-EGDE-EA nanocomposite particles cast from pH 5.5 dispersion.

The Fe3O4-NICS-EGDE-EA nanocomposite particles
were highly dispersible at physiological pH because of the mild negative
surface charge (−15 mV). The conversion into isoelectric charge
under weakly acidic conditions enabled the Fe3O4-NICS-EGDE-EA nanocomposite to act as a smart magnetic switch suitable
for the magnetothermal treatment of acidic cells.

2.7 Buffering Capacity of Nanocomposites
The relative buffering
abilities of the Fe3O4-NICS-EGDE and Fe3O4-NICS-EGDE-EA nanocomposite
particles were studied using acid–base titration to evaluate
buffering capacity affecting the proton-sponge effect in endosomal
escape and cytosolic delivery (Figure 5).27,28 The charge-conversional Fe3O4-NICS-EGDE-EA nanocomposite particles exhibited
stronger buffering effect in the pH range of 5.0–7.5 than did
Fe3O4-NICS-EGDE, which can be ascribed to the
presence of a substantial number of secondary amine groups originating
from EA in addition to the −COO– and the
primary amine moieties inherently included in CS. The high buffering
capability of the charge-conversional nanocomposite particles is advantageous
for protonation in endosomes with relatively weaker pH, resulting
in endosomal membrane disruption and endosomal escape of the system.

capacity of Fe3O4-NICS-EGDE and Fe3O4-NICS-EGDE-EA nanocomposite particles (1 mg mL–1) in 150 mM NaCl aq. buffer (initial pH 11.50) titrated
with 0.1 M HCl aq.

2.8 pH-Dependent
Hemolysis of RBCs by Fe3O4-NICS-EGDE-EA Nanocomposite
Particles
The hemocompatibility
of theranostic nanoparticles is essential for their systemic internalization.
Accordingly, we examined the impact of charge-conversional Fe3O4-NICS-EGDE-EA nanocomposite particles on sheep
red blood cells (RBCs) using a hemolysis assay at 37 °C for 5
h. Figure 6 depicts
the pH-dependent hemolytic activities of the charge-conversional Fe3O4-NICS-EGDE-EA nanocomposite particles. The degree
of hemolysis increased with increasing nanocomposite concentration
and decreasing pH, but it remained below 2%. This enhancement of hemolysis
in low-pH media originated from the decrease in the surface anionic
characteristic of the nanocomposite particles, which strengthens interactions
between the nanocomposite particles, and the negative surface of RBC
membranes, resulting in hemolytic potential that is 3 times higher
at pH 5.0 than that at pH 7.4. The nanocomposite particles showed
negligible hemolytic activity at pH 7.4, and it was only 0.59% even
at very high concentration (600 μg mL–1) because
of their mildly negative surface charge. The degree of hemolysis was
increased with increasing incubation periods (Figure S7), but it remained below 1.0% under physiological
conditions after 5 h. These values are still approximately 10 times
lower than the permissible limit of hemolysis for blood-contacting
biomaterials.57 Although the charge-conversional
Fe3O4-NICS-EGDE-EA nanocomposite particles were
sufficiently dispersed in the RBC suspension under the examined conditions,
the unmodified Fe3O4-NICS-EGDE nanocomposite
particles were not dispersible under the physiological conditions
(Figure S8a–c). As a result, the
hemolytic activities of the unmodified Fe3O4-NICS-EGDE nanocomposite particles were negligible (below 0.5%, Figure S8d) because of the negligible interaction,
but the insufficient dispersibility prevents their practical applications.
Furthermore, the hemolytic activity of the charge-conversional Fe3O4-NICS-EGDE-EA nanocomposite particles is lower
than that previously reported for CS-coated Fe3O4 materials. For example, the degree of hemolysis of sheep RBCs was
3.2% in our previously reported Fe3O4 coated
with carboxy-functionalized CS at 500 μg mL–1.54 In another report,20 Fe3O4 coated with CS-Malt designed
for drug delivery showed 4.9% hemolysis toward human RBCs at 400 μg
mL–1. The higher hemocompatibility of charge-conversional
Fe3O4-NICS-EGDE-EA nanocomposite particles is
ascribable to its charge (−15 mV), which is identical to that
of healthy RBCs (−15.7 mV)58 and
milder than that of the aforementioned materials (−27 and −52
mV).

Figure 6 Hemolytic activities of charge-conversional Fe3O4-NICS-EGDE-EA nanocomposite particles toward sheep RBCs in
physiological solution (150 mM NaCl aq.) incubated at 37 °C for
5 h.

2.9 Morphology
of RBCs
Figure 7 illustrates the morphologies
of RBCs in the presence and absence of the charge-conversional Fe3O4-NICS-EGDE-EA nanocomposite particles incubated
at pH 5.5 for 5 h. The nanocomposite particles were cationically charged
at this pH by charge conversion via the protonation of the surface
amine groups. As a result, the particles were adhered on the surface
of RBC membranes and caused structural distortion and aggregation
of RBCs (Figure 7a),
whereas the RBCs maintained their native morphology in the absence
of the nanocomposite particles (Figure 7b). Hemolysis proceeded during incubation as confirmed
by optical microscopic studies (Figure S9). This pH-dependent interaction with RBC membranes implies the application
of the charge-conversional Fe3O4-NICS-EGDE-EA
nanocomposite particles in targeting acidic cells, such as inflamed
and tumor cells.

2.10 Temperature
Evolution under MW Irradiation
The energy dissipation and
hemolytic abilities of the charge-conversional
Fe3O4-NICS-EGDE-EA nanocomposite particles were
evaluated under MW-induced magnetic heating (Figure 8). The heating experiments were conducted
at physiological pH (7.4) and acidic pH (5.5), where the composite
adhered to RBCs. Here, the RBC suspension was used as a model system
for cell lines. The temperature rose as MW irradiation progressed
in the identical tendency regardless of the sample, indicating the
ignorable effect of the magnetic nanocomposite on the global temperature
of the system. For example, the temperatures after 180 s MW irradiation
was in the range of 50–54 °C. However, the color of the
medium was changed significantly from red to black only in the sample
with the nanocomposite particles at pH 5.5, as indicated in the inset
image (Figure 8), demonstrating
significant pH-dependent membranolysis of RBCs, as described later.

presence and absence of Fe3O4-NICS-EGDE-EA nanocomposite

2.11 pH-Triggered,
MW-Induced Membranolysis of
RBCs by Fe3O4-NICS-EGDE-EA Nanocomposite
We presumed that the selective change in color originated from the
synergistic effects of MW irradiation and the adherence of the charge-conversional
Fe3O4-NICS-EGDE-EA nanocomposite particles.
Accordingly, the hemolysis behavior under MW irradiation was investigated
in detail. RBCs were incubated with different concentrations (25,
50, and 100 μg mL–1) of the charge-conversional
Fe3O4-NICS-EGDE-EA nanocomposite particles dispersed
in 100 mL of buffer (150 mM NaCl aq.) at pHs 5.5, 6.5, 6.8, and 7.4.
These slightly acidic conditions were selected for models of typical
extracellular (pH = 6.5–7.0)59−61 and intracellular (pH
= 4.5–7.2)25−27 environments of cancers. After incubation for 5 h
at 37 °C, each sample and controls were exposed to MW for 30
s and their temperature was measured. The temperature of all samples
and controls were within the range of 42–45 °C. Despite
the identical temperature, significant discoloration of the RBC suspension
from red to black occurred in the samples at pH 5.5, whereas partial
discoloration (Figure S10a,b) were observed
for the samples at pHs 6.8 and 6.5. The degree of hemolysis was increased
with the increase of the concentration of the charge-conversional
Fe3O4-NICS-EGDE-EA nanocomposite particles and
the decrease of pH (Figure 9a). For example, the degrees of hemolysis by 100 μg
mL–1 of the charge-conversional Fe3O4-NICS-EGDE-EA nanocomposite particles were 19, 30, and 42%
at pHs 6.8, 6.5, and 5.5, respectively. On the other hand, at pH 7.4,
the charge-conversional Fe3O4-NICS-EGDE-EA nanocomposite
particles exhibited negligible hemolytic activities under the identical
conditions, as explained earlier. To confirm these results, RBC dispersions
containing 100 μg mL–1 nanocomposite particles
were observed under an optical microscope. At pH 7.4, the RBCs maintained
their regular shape without membrane destruction (Figure 9b), whereas they were mostly
damaged at pH 5.5 (Figure 9c) and partially disrupted at pHs 6.8 and 6.5 (Figure S10c,d). This pH-dependent membranolysis
of RBC can be explained by the difference in the adherence of the
nanocomposite particles toward the membranes of RBC originating from
the surface charge-conversional property described in Figure 4. The membrane rapture was
further certified by magnetic separation of the broken RBC debris
containing the MNPs in the dispersed medium, whereas the RBCs dispersed
under identical condition at pH 7.4 were not attracted at all by a
magnet (Figure 9d).
This selective magnetic separation demonstrates the enhanced magnetism
by particle accumulation, as well as the magnetic targetability and
acidity-sensing ability of the charge-conversional Fe3O4-NICS-EGDE-EA nanocomposite particles. A similar behavior
was reported for targeted iron oxide MNPs that could selectively reach
to the tumor cells and cause their lysis by AMF-induced heating.44,45 This difference clearly manifests that the Fe3O4-NICS-EGDE-EA nanocomposite particles only interacted with RBCs when
they were cationically charged under acidic conditions, resulting
in local hyperthermia or MW-induced particle rotation disrupting the
membrane of RBCs.

3 Conclusions
A charge-conversional,
magnetically targetable, and covalently
cross-linked NICS-coated Fe3O4 nanocomposite
was successfully synthesized. The nanocomposite particles were composed
of highly crystalline, nanosized, superparamagnetic, and single Fe3O4 cores with a thin coated layer of functionalized
polysaccharides. Significant pH responsiveness and colloidal stability
in physiological buffers were introduced to the nanocomposite particles
via surface modification with EA. In acidic environments, the charge-conversional
nanocomposite particles converted the ζ potential from negative
to positive, confirming the responsiveness to variable environments.
The nanocomposite particles self-assembled specifically in weakly
acidic environments to offer relatively stronger magnetism than under
physiological conditions. The nanocomposite adhered to RBCs at a weakly
acidic pH range, whereas they did not interact under physiological
conditions. Because of this specific interaction, the MW-induced hemolysis
of RBCs effectively occurred at pHs 5.5–6.8 with a change in
global temperature identical to that in the absence of the nanocomposite
or at physiological pH. As the conversion into cationic charge was
attained under slightly acidic environments, the resultant positive
surface charge is advantageous in the uptake processes of acidic cells
proceeding through membrane adhesion and endocytosis. Although the
present form of the composite showed excellent performance for membranolysis
of RBC, optimization of the functionalization degrees and the functional
groups will further improve the selectivity and targeting ability
toward acidic cells. For example, as the charge-conversional Fe3O4-NICS-EGDE-EA nanocomposite possesses alkenyl,
carboxy, and amine groups, conjugation with bioactive agents, such
as peptides, may synergistically improve the efficacy. We anticipate
that our designed system will find practical applications in cell-specific
thermotherapy for cancer.

4.3 Synthesis of NICS
NICS was synthesized
by modifying the reported method for CS functionalization.62 CS (1.0 g, 6.1 mmol glucosamine unit) was dissolved
in 200 mL of acetate buffer (pH 5.5) with magnetic stirring overnight.
IAn (0.34 g, 3.0 mmol) dissolved in 10 mL of methanol was added dropwise
to the CS solution for 30 min. The reaction mixture was magnetically
stirred at room temperature for 12 h and neutralized with 10 M NaOH
aq. The neutralized mixture was then added dropwise to an excess amount
of acetone to precipitate NICS, and it was separated by centrifugation.
Crude NICS was redispersed in DDW and reprecipitated in acetone. Purified
NICS was dried in a vacuum desiccator at ambient temperature and obtained
as a colorless flake with 85% yield. 1H NMR (400 MHz, D2O, 90 °C, δ in ppm): 2.5–2.6 (3H, −COCH3), 3.10–3.30 (2H, −CH2–COO–), 3.7–3.9 (1H,
>C2H−), 4.0–4.4 (5H,
>C3H–, >C4H–, >C5H–,
and −C6H2−),
4.9–5.0 (1H,
>C1H), 6.0–6.1 (1H, >C=CHb), and 6.4–6.5 (1H, >C=CHb′).
FTIR (cm–1): 571, 1067, 1382, 1559, 1652, 2882,
2921, 3088, and 3385. XRD (2θ in deg): 8.5 and 20.

4.4 Preparation of Fe3O4-NICS-EGDE Nanocomposite
Particles
NICS (100 mg) was dispersed
in a flask containing 180 mL of DDW by magnetic stirring. FeCl3·6H2O (270 mg, 1.00 mmol) and FeSO4·7H2O (139 mg, 0.50 mmol) were dissolved in 10 mL
of DDW in an N2 atmosphere. Both mixtures were added to
a two-necked flask, and the flask was placed in a thermostat oil bath
maintained at 80 °C. The final light brown mixture was homogenized
by magnetic stirring while bubbling N2. Then, 5.0 mL of
aqueous ammonia solution (28%) was added at once, and the color of
the mixture instantly turned from light brown to dark black. After
30 min of reaction, EGDE (25 mg, 1.0 mmol) dispersed in 5.0 mL of
DDW was added dropwise to the mixture, and the reaction was continued
for 30 min. The mixture was cooled to room temperature after the reaction.
The resulting Fe3O4-NICS-EGDE nanocomposite
particles were collected using a magnet and extensively washed with
DDW until the pH value of the supernatant became neutral. The washed
Fe3O4-NICS-EGDE nanocomposite particles were
dried in a vacuum desiccator at ambient temperature for 24 h and kept
in a refrigerator for further use.

4.5 Functionalization
of Fe3O4-NICS-EGDE Nanocomposite Particles with
EA
Fe3O4-NICS-EGDE nanocomposite particles
(250 mg, 0.303 mmol
glucosamine unit) were dispersed in 200 mL of DDW. EA (500 mg, 0.151
mmol) diluted in 50 mL of DDW was added dropwise to the dispersion
for 30 min. The dispersion was magnetically stirred for 24 h at room
temperature in the dark. The reaction mixture was then slowly added
to a 1:1 (v/v) mixture of water and methanol to precipitate the product.
The precipitate was collected by a magnet and repeatedly rinsed with
DDW. The washed product was dried in a vacuum desiccator for 24 h
in the dark and stored in a refrigerator.

4.6 Model
Reaction of NICS and EA
The
reaction of NICS (0.303 mmol glucosamine unit) and EA (0.151 mmol)
was conducted under the identical conditions following the procedure
described for the functionalization of the Fe3O4-NICS-EGDE nanocomposite with EA (Scheme 2). After the reaction, the reaction mixture
was added dropwise to an excess amount of acetone to precipitate the
product, and the precipitate was separated by filtration. The crude
product was dissolved in DDW, and the solution was poured into an
excess amount of acetone. The reprecipitated product (yield 80%) was
dried in a vacuum desiccator for 48 h. 1H NMR (400 MHz,
D2O, δ in ppm): 1.80–1.90 (3H, −COCH3), 2.40–2.70 (3H, −OOC–CH2–CH<), 2.94 (2H, −NH–CH2−), 3.05–3.12 (2H, −OOC–CH2–C=C<), 3.30 (2H, >CH–CH2–NH−), 3.40–3.50 (1H,
>CH−), 3.55–3.65 (2H, −CH2–OH), 4.2–4.55 (5H, >C3H–, >C4H–,
>C5H– and −C6H2−), 4.90 (1H, >C1H−), 5.25–5.35 (1H, >C=CHa−), and 5.7–5.8 (1H, >C=CHb−).

4.7 Buffer
Capacity Analysis
The buffering
capacities of the nanocomposites were evaluated by acid–base
titration. The nanocomposite particles (1.0 mg mL–1) were dispersed in 20 mL of NaCl aq. (0.150 M) buffer. After adding
0.1 mL of NaOH aq. (1.0 M) to the mixture, the basic dispersion was
titrated with 0.1 M HCl aq. solution. The pH values were recorded
by a HORIBA (Kyoto, Japan) 9615-10D pH meter.

4.8 Hemocompatibility
Study
Hemolysis
activities of the Fe3O4-NICS-EGDE-EA nanocomposite
particles were assayed with modifications to the reported method.54 Sheep whole blood (40 mL) was centrifuged at
3500 rpm for 5 min. RBCs were separated by careful decantation of
supernatant plasma and then washed with physiological buffer (150
mM NaCl aq.) three times. The washed RBCs were redispersed in physiological
buffer (40 mL). The charge-conversional Fe3O4-NICS-EGDE-EA nanocomposite particles dispersed in physiological
buffer was mixed with the RBC suspension. The final concentrations
of the nanocomposite in the dispersion were adjusted to 100, 200,
400, and 600 μg mL–1. The pH of the dispersions
was adjusted to the corresponding values (5.0–7.4) using 0.01
N HCl aq. solution. Triton X-100 (1% aq. solution) and physiological
buffer were added to the RBC suspensions to prepare the positive (100%
lysis) and negative (0% lysis) control samples, respectively. All
of the samples were incubated at 37 °C for 1, 3, and 5 h. The
samples were gently shaken once every 20 min for resuspension. After
incubation, the RBCs were separated by centrifugation (10 000
rpm, 5 min) and the supernatant solutions were incubated for 30 min
at room temperature to oxidize hemoglobin. The absorbance of oxyhemoglobin
was assessed by optical absorption at 540 nm. The hemolysis (%) of
RBCs was calculated using the following equation  For MW-induced magnetically
triggered hemolysis
experiments, the samples were made following the aforementioned procedures.
Before centrifugation, the samples were exposed to MW radiation (2.45
GHz) for 30 s with an output power of 200 W, and the temperatures
of the dispersions were recorded. All experiments were performed in
duplicate, and the resulting data were shown as average values.

4.9 Studies of RBC Morphology
The morphology
of RBCs was observed using a light microscope. In brief, the washed
RBCs were added to a physiological buffer containing the charge-conversional
Fe3O4-NICS-EGDE-EA nanocomposite particles at
600 μg mL–1, and the pH value was adjusted
to 5.5 using 0.01 M HCl aq. The resulting dispersion was incubated
at 37 °C for 5 h and mildly shaken once every 20 min. After incubation,
the dispersion was treated with a magnet to remove free nanocomposite
particles. Then, the RBCs were separated by centrifugation, further
washed, and redispersed in physiological buffer. A control sample
was also made without adding the nanocomposite. The washed RBC suspension
(10 μL) was placed on a glass slide and covered with a coverslip
glass. The resulting specimens were observed with an Olympus (Tokyo,
Japan) CKX53 microscope, and the color pictures were captured using
a Visualix Pro2 (Kobe, Japan) camera. All images were taken at the
magnification of 20×.

4.10 Magnetic Heating under
MW Irradiation (Typical
Procedure)
The MW irradiation experiments were conducted
in a Yamazen (Osaka, Japan) MW-Y205 MW oven operated at 2.45 GHz with
a radiation output power of 200 W. A 200 mL Erlenmeyer flask containing
100 mL of a colloidal dispersion of 100 μg mL–1 of the charge-conversional Fe3O4-NICS-EGDE-EA
nanocomposite particles and another 200 mL Erlenmeyer flask containing
100 mL of water were placed together in the oven. The second flask
was added as a dummy load to absorb excessive MW radiation power.
The dispersions were exposed to sequential 0.25–3.0 min of
MW irradiation, and the temperature was subsequently measured with
an A & D (Tokyo, Japan) AD-5612WP dual-mode infrared thermometer.
The sample mixtures were shaken gently before each measurement to
attain bulk temperature. Temperature equilibration and the measurements
were conducted within 10 s. Each heating experiment was conducted
in 5 min intervals to attain homogeneous exposure of MW radiation
to samples. All experiments were performed in triplicates, and the
results are shown with corresponding error bars.
