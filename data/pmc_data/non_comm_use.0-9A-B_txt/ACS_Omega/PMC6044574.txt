Carbon dots (CDs) obtained from rapeseed
pollen with a high production
yield, good biocompatibility, good water solubility, low cost, and
simple synthesis are systematically characterized. They can be directly
added to Hoagland nutrient solution for planting hydroponically cultivated Lactuca sativa L. to explore their influence on the
plants at different concentrations. By measuring lettuce indices of
growth, morphology, nutrition quality, gas exchange, and content of
photosynthetic pigment, amazing growth-promotion effects of CDs were
discovered, and the mechanism was analyzed. Moreover, the in vivo
transport route of CDs in lettuce was evaluated by macroscopic and
microscopic observations under UV light excitation. The results demonstrate
that pollen-derived CDs can be potentially used as a miraculous fertilizer
for agricultural applications and as a great in vivo plant bioimaging
probe.

Introduction
Carbon nanomaterials
(CNMs) have found uses in many fields, such
as optical devices, superconductor materials, molecular switches (memory
switch), quantum computers, and biomedical applications, because of
their exceptional mechanical, thermal, optical, and electrical properties.1 Among these, studies of the fantastic effects
of carbon nanotubes (CNTs), carbon nano-onions (CNOs), fullerenes,
fullerols, and carbon nanohorns on plant growth have attracted increasing
attention in recent years.2−4 Taking CNTs as an example, previous
research found that tomato plants grown in soil supplemented with
50 μg/L multiwalled CNTs could produce 2 times more fruit than
the control group.3 However, CNMs are not
good candidates for this use because of the following shortcomings:
high equipment cost coupled with a low yield, cumbersome synthesis
steps such as high-temperature reaction, complicated purification
with unavoidable heavy metal residues, insolubility in water before
further modification, and so forth.5−7 These problems push the
cost and practicability of using CNMs in agriculture to an unacceptable
level. Moreover, increasing the soil carbon pool can enhance both
crop productivity and yield stability, which is attributed to the
significance of carbon for crop growth. Therefore, finding another
CNM with great fertilizer efficiency is essential.

Carbon dots
(CDs) are one of the most promising CNMs, possessing
superb properties including low toxicity, good biocompatibility, chemical
inertness, good water solubility, low cost, widely available precursors,
and eco-friendly preparation, and have inspired extensive research
in a wide variety of fields including bioimaging, biosensing, sensors,
security, photocatalysis, and optoelectronic devices; however, they
have not been used in agriculture, yet they have tremendous potential
advantages.8 First, their low toxicity,
good biocompatibility, and eco-friendly preparation ensure safety
for crops, the human body, and the environment. Second, the large-scale
synthesis and application of CDs in plant cultivation are made possible
because of their low cost and widely available precursors. Third,
their stability and storability after being added into nutrient solution
are guaranteed by their chemical inertness. As a zero-dimensional
nanomaterial (particle size ≤ 100 nm) with good solubility
in water, they could be absorbed easily by most crops since one-dimensional
CNTs can be transported into the cell nucleus of Arabidopsis.3 Additionally, the fluorescence properties
of CDs provide a tool to track their route after being absorbed by
plants and to evaluate their mechanism of action.

Although Tripathi
and Sarkar claimed positive effects of CDs on
roots of wheat,9 the maximal particle size
of the material they used was near 100 nm, almost beyond the recognized
scope of CDs. Also, no emission spectrum was presented in their paper,
and the 10 day cultivation period they used made their results extremely
controversial. Thus, currently, no one has made acceptable use of
CDs in agricultural studies.

Herein, as shown in Figure 1, CDs synthesized on a massive
scale from rapeseed pollen
by a hydrothermal method were directly added to Hoagland nutrient
solution after being characterized. Afterward, Rome lettuce was cultivated
hydroponically as a model to explore the influence of CDs on plants
at different concentrations. Lettuce indices of growth, morphology,
quality, gas exchange, and content of photosynthetic pigment were
measured after the plants were harvested to explore the influence
of the CDs. Moreover, the in vivo transport routes of the CDs in lettuce
were also observed through macroscopic and microscopic observations
under UV light excitation, and mechanisms are discussed based on the
obtained data.

Figure 1 Schematic diagram of this research work.

Results and Discussion
The volume
of the reaction system was increased from 400 to 800
mL. The particle size distribution of the CDs is shown in the transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) image (Figure 2a,c). The mean diameter (Dm) was 5.2 nm (Figure 2c), which is larger than the reported result (1.9 nm).10 In addition, 52% of the CDs were between 3.1
and 5.1 nm. Clear lattice fringes with interplanar spacings of 0.20
nm were observed in the high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image (Figure 2b), which demonstrate
that these CDs possess a crystalline graphitized core.11 The individual X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS) spectrum for C 1s, N 1s, and O 1s binding energies (Figures 2d and S1a–c) revealed that three types of carbon
(C–C, C–O/C–N, and C=O), two types of
nitrogen (C–N–C and N–H), and two types of oxygen
(C=O and C–O) are present in the CDs. Fourier transform
infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy demonstrated the presence of carboxyl,
hydroxyl, and amino groups embedded in the CDs (Figure 2e). Specifically, characteristic peaks at
1662, 2976, 3405, and 3405 cm–1 correspond to the
stretching vibrations of C=O, C–H, O–H, and N–H,
respectively, whereas peaks at 1052 and 1400 cm–1 are attributed to the bending vibrations of C–N–C
and N–H,12,13 which is consistent with the
XPS result (Figure S1a–c).14−16

(d) XPS survey spectrum, and (e) FTIR spectrum of the obtained CDs.

In addition, the transmittance
of C=O was higher than that
of N–H (Figure 2e) and the ratio of C=O was lower than that of C–O
(Figure S1a), which conflicts with the
original study, verifying the reduction of the carboxyl group. For
this reason, the conjugative effect of C=O with aromatic carbon
on the surface of the CDs was weakened, resulting in a lower intensity
and blue shift of the absorption peak from 280 nm to approximately
270 nm (Figure S1e).17 Furthermore, the absorption peak is consistent with the
typical absorption of an aromatic π system, similar to that
of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.18

The wavelength-dependent fluorescence emission spectra of the CDs
are shown in Figure S1d; they exhibited
tunable emission from 424 to 503 nm upon excitation from 340 to 440
nm. The optimal excitation wavelength was 360 nm, with the emission
peaking at 432 nm. Notably, the intensity of the broad peak under
380 nm was close to the one under 360 nm, which gave proof of the
uneven and larger particle size shown in the TEM image (Figure 2a). A larger size always accompanies
a reduction in quantum confinement, leading to red shifts in the emission
spectra.18 Consistent with the fluorescent
spectrum, the dilute solution of CDs possessed a tawny color under
sunlight and showed blue fluorescence under excitation at 365 nm (Figure S1e).

The quantum yield (QY) of
the CDs upon excitation at 360 nm was
calculated to be 7.7%, using quinine sulfate as the reference, which
was a bit lower than the reported result (10.2% at 80 mL).13 Interestingly, by analyzing the XPS survey spectra
(Figure S1), the C, N, and O contents of
the CDs were determined to be 67.3, 7.6, and 25.1%, respectively,
whereas they were previously found to be 66.3, 8.2, and 25.5%, respectively.
It is clear that this reaction condition decreased the N content but
did nothing to the C and O contents. Researchers have found that a
larger nitrogen content in CDs leads to a more intense emission,12 which is the reason for the lower QY in this
study.

After suction filtration using a mixed cellulose ester
membrane
(0.22 μm), the mean volume of the CD solution was 720 mL, with
a mean concentration of 8.0 mg/mL. The production yield was 28.8%,
close to the original result (30% at 40 mL), indicating that a consistent
high yield was obtained after increasing the size of the reaction
system. Moreover, the price of rapeseed pollen is only 0.01 dollars/g,
which means that the price of the CDs is 0.03 dollars/g, solving the
problem of the high cost of large-scale synthesis.

Overall,
after enlarging the volume of the reaction system from
400 to 800 mL, the CDs used in this research still possessed the advantages
of high production yield, low cost, and a simple synthesis process
and they had a larger size and modest fluorescence properties, which
means that they can meet the dose requirement of macroscale hydroponic
culture. Additionally, synthesis from biomass without any heavy metal
content endows these CDs with possible use for vegetable cultivation.
More importantly, their excellent biocompatibility and water solubility
with great stability have been demonstrated in previous studies.10,13 Thus, using these CDs for the hydroponic cultivation of vegetables
is reasonable and feasible.

The growth behavior of lettuce cultivated
with different concentrations
of CDs was evaluated, and the results indicated that the biomass and
leaf area of the lettuce obviously increased as the CD concentration
increased (Figures 3 and S2). The best result was obtained
for the 30 mg/L treated sample: the biomass of lettuce increased by
48.09% over that of untreated lettuce (0 mg/L), close to the growth
rate of shoot fresh weight (FW) and dry weight (DW), whereas it was
25.19% at 10 mg/L (Figure S2i). There was
no significant difference between 20 and 30 mg/L; the growth rate
for the former was 41.98%. In summary, the increase of the leaf area
and leaf number contributed to the promotion of shoot FW and DW together.

Figure 3 Effect
of the concentration of supplementary CDs on the yield and
morphology of lettuce.

Most nutrient qualities were unaffected by the CDs; for example,
there was no significant difference among the contents of ascorbic
acid (AA) (Figure S3a), soluble sugar (SS)
(Figure S3b), and soluble protein (SP)
(Figure S3c). However, different CD concentrations
remarkably affected the nitrate content (Figure 4a) of lettuce compared with that of the control
group; for example, 20 mg/L CD-treated lettuce had the lowest nitrate
content, which decreased by 33% . The transpiration rate (Figure 4b) and stomatal conductance
(Figure 4c) had the
same changing tendency; the trends of other photosynthesis indices
(chlorophyll content, net photosynthetic rate, and intercellular CO2 concentration) are presented in Figures S3 and S4. The pH value of the nutrient solution was controlled
at 6.0–7.0; from Figure 4d,e, it can be seen that the CD concentration had no significant
effect on the pH and electrical conductivity (EC) of the nutrient
solution.

(b) transpiration rate, (c) stomatal conductance, (d) pH, and (e)
EC.

As mentioned above, the obtained
CDs can efficiently emit blue
light under excitation, which provides the possibility of utilizing
the change in the CD emission intensity to monitor the transport systems
in lettuce. To test this, 0 and 1 mg/mL CD-treated lettuce samples
were measured (Figure S5). Compared with
the control group where no fluorescence was exhibited, blue fluorescence
was exhibited in the main leaf veins, stems, and especially roots
of 1–1 (Figure 5a–c); the obvious fluorescence on the surface of the cells
was arresting and looked like a heart (Figure 5d,e), which proved that the CDs were on the
cell walls in the experimental group (Figure 5f,g; rip-cut sample). Moreover, breathtaking
photos containing root cells with bright blue fluorescence at every
pore were taken successfully. The lack of a vascular bundle around
the root cells provided persuasive evidence for the transport and
uptake of CDs within cells in the treated group compared with the
control group. Similar observations were also found in the stems and
main leaf veins (Figures S7 and S8). The
inner slight fluorescence in cells indicated that the vascular bundle
is the channel by which the CDs are transported.

Figure 5 Macroscopic observations
of shoots (a), roots (b), and plants (c)
under UV light excitation. Microscopic observations of roots of control
(d, e) and leaves (f, g) under UV–vis light excitation.

The water in plants is transported
through apoplast or cellular
pathways, and the absorption kinetics is driven by hydrostatic pressure
gradients.19 More than that, the uptake
of anthropogenic organic chemicals, fullerols, fullerenes (C70), and
CNOs by plant roots has been proven to be a passive process through
the transpiration stream; thus, it is not surprising that greater
transpiration leads to increased accumulation of them.20−22 Therefore, in consideration of the abundant hydrophilic organic
groups on the surface of the CDs and their blue fluorescence exhibited
in the xylem, the transport path of the CDs in lettuce is most likely
via the transpiration stream. Under these circumstances, it is notable
that the CDs were transported from the nutrient solution to vascular
bundles both by apoplast and cellular pathways with water. Then, they
were transported by vessels in the xylem of the vascular bundles,
which are responsible for the transportation of water and minerals
from the bottom of the plant upward.23 Hence,
most CDs gathered in vessels within main leaf veins, which could be
verified because they exhibited the strongest blue light (Figures 5e,g, S7, and S8). Also, the existence of green light
in this part, which was mostly caused by the excitation of intermediates
from transformation or conjugation reactions with larger size and
weaker quantum confinement CDs, strongly demonstrated the metabolism
of CDs by lettuce.24 Some specific indices
varied widely in the Rome lettuce. In summary, shoot FW and DW, leaf
width, leaf area, and leaf number showed a nearly linear positive
correlation as the concentration of CDs increased from 10 to 30 mg/L
(Figure S2), resulting in the best production
yield at 30 mg/L. From this data, it is suggested that the addition
of CDs could enlarge the leaf area by extending the leaf width and
increase the leaf number significantly, which jointly contributed
to the enlargement of shoot FW and DW. In addition, the variation
trends of other indices did not fit the above data (Figures 4 and S3); that is, the reduction rate of the nitrate content and the growth
rates of root DW, stomatal conductance (Gs), and transpiration rate
(Tr) reached their maximum values at 20 mg/L. This similar variation
trend of Tr and Gs was identical to that of previous studies; i.e.,
greater Gs generates faster Tr.25 As well,
water absorption would become more efficient through better growth
of roots, accommodating the urgent requirement of high-strength Tr.26 At this point, exploring the reason that the
CDs induce the growth of leaf width, leaf number, and Gs is critical.

Nitrate content was used to being exploring the reason that CDs
effect lettuce growth. It is known that nitrate is an important material
for osmoregulation of lettuce and the nitrogen source both for Chl
and protein of plants.27,28 The lack of an increase in the
SS and Chl contents indicated that this was not a main contributor.
The increase in the growth and morphological indices at 20 mg/L was
not the most remarkable one; the greatest result was obtained at 30
mg/L with a higher nitrate content, affirming that it did not play
a main role in these indices too. Moreover, the shoot water content
was nearly the same, indicating that such a decrease could not be
produced by the attenuation of water from greater transpiration. Now
that the above possibilities regarding assimilation and dilution have
been determined not to be involved, the possibility that osmotic pressure
was increased by the addition of CDs was taken into consideration.

In similar research conducted using CNOs as the additive, the sustained
and slow release of nutrient ions within the xylem was caused by interactions
of surface groups, and these ions play a key role in the observed
effects.4,22 Because CDs and CNOs both are zero-dimensional
CNMs with spherical profiles and ample groups on their surfaces, the
possbility of an analogous impact in the xylem by CDs deserves consideration.
In this study, CDs possessing vast carboxyl, hydroxyl, and amino groups
(Figure 2e) are able
to trap nutrient ions by hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions
for controlled release. When they are accumulated in the vessels of
leaf main veins, CDs can release these ions persistently, resulting
in increases in leaf width and leaf number with higher ion concentration
in tissues. Furthermore, the aforementioned higher ion concentration
may be the reason for the increased Gs because it is well-known that
the concentration of ions, including K+ and Ca2+ which are abundant in Hoagland nutrient solution, has an immense
impact on its state.29 For example, a moderate
concentration of K+ in stomata guard cells would increase
Gs, whereas an excess woul decrease it.30 In other words, the proper dose of nutrient ions released from CDs
promoted the Gs of lettuce, hence accelerating the transpiration stream
containing nutrient ions, which facilitated lettuce growth. In addition,
plants adjust their nitrate concentration to maintain their osmotic
pressure, which might be destroyed by a high concentration of nutrient
ions, presenting as a reduction of nitrate content.27 However, such ions were excessive for stomata guard cells
at 30 mg/L, which led to a slight decrease of Tr by 11.8% (compared
with that at 20 mg/L). The relatively faster growing rate (50%) in
the presence of CDs not only filled this nutrient vacancy caused by
a weaker transpiration stream but also facilitated the growth of lettuce
on the basis of cultivation at 20 mg/L. Possibly, such an amount of
extraneous ions was beyond the ability of initiative adjustment, resulting
in a rebound of the nitrate content. As a consequence, the increase
in Tr may be generated partly by reaction of the CDs themselves with
the xylem, as such a phenomenon has been confirmed in research on
CNTs and CNOs, although specific mechanisms still need further study.6,31 Moreover, the CDs serving as a carbon source for metabolism in lettuce
may also be one of the mechanisms since shoot and root DWs both increased,
as shown in Figure S2b,c.32

From Figure S6, CDs could
be blamed
for inhibition effects possibly related to soil salinity when they
are used at high concentration.33 At a
high concentration of 1 mg/mL, which is over 33 times that at 30 mg/L,
lettuce could grow for 37 days at least, providing a superb demonstration
of the excellent biocompatibility and water solubility of the CDs
used in this work. Hence, making use of CDs in cultivation is worth
approving.

From another perspective, it is well-known that AA
is an important
antioxidant component both for human health and vegetable growth.34,35 Nitrate can be restored into nitrite, which damages human health,
whereas vegetables constitute its major dietary source.40 SS is not only important for the quality of
lettuce but also for its taste.36 SP comprises
functional proteins mostly in the form of enzymes, which also constitute
one of the important indices of senescence in vegetables.37,38 CDs can reduce the nitrate content without affecting the other three
indices; thus, its capacity to improve these quality indices should
be recognized as well.

Conclusions
In the present work,
CDs were hydrothermally synthesized in a simple
manner from rapeseed pollen with a high production yield and low cost
(0.03 dollars/g). The obtained CDs showed great biocompatibility,
good water solubility, larger size, and modest fluorescence properties.
Rome lettuce was hydroponically cultivated with different concentrations
of the obtained CDs, and the results showed that 20–30 mg/L
CDs can increase the production yield strikingly and decrease the
nitrate content. It was confirmed that the CDs are transported from
nutrient solutions to vessels within the xylem of vascular bundles
both by apoplast and cellular pathways along with the transpiration
stream. This study indicates that CDs synthesized from rapeseed pollen
can act as a perfect material for labeling cells in vivo, affecting
plant physiology processes, and increasing plant yields.

Experimental
Section
Hydrothermal Synthesis of CDs
With reference to the
original method,10 20 g of rapeseed pollen
purchased from Taobao was dispersed in 800 mL of deionized water.
After being sonicated for 5 min, it was transferred into a 1 L stainless
steel autoclave (Xintai GSHA-1) and maintained at 200 °C for
24 h with a stirring rate of 100 rpm. Then, the CD solution was obtained
after separating the impurities by vacuum filtration using a mixed
cellulose ester membrane (0.22 μm pore size). Afterward, the
solution was stored at 2 °C for further characterization and
application.

Hydroponic Cultivation of Rome Lettuce
Lettuce cultivation
was carried out in 24 growing channels placed on 4 shelves of a stainless
steel rack indoors (Figure S9), which means
that there were 6 channels for each concentration of CDs. In fact,
each light-emitting diode tube (Jinlei JL-T8PLA001) consisted of 192
lamp beads, with a 6:1 red light to blue light ratio; the peak positions
of the red and blue light were 451 and 643 nm, respectively. The photoperiod
was 14 h, and the total light intensity per channel was 150 μmol
m–2 s–1. Every concentration contained
three repeats with 36 lettuces in each group (Figure S9b,c). Half-strength Hoagland nutrient solution (50
L) with 0, 10, 20, or 30 mg/L CDs was transported to the lettuce for
30 min every 90 min by water pumps. During the first half of the hydroponic
cultivation period, water was added every 2 days and nutrient solution
was replaced every 6 days. Furthermore, the frequency was changed
to every day and every 4 days in the second half of the cultivation
period. 1 M HNO3 solution and 1 M KOH solution were used
to ensure that the pH of all nutrient solutions was between 6.0 and
7.0 for the regular growth of lettuce. The entire hydroponic cultivation
time was 25 days, and the temperature was between 18.4 and 21.6 °C
with the humidity from 54.0 to 68.6% indoors. All Rome lettuces possessed
5 leaves containing 1 heart leaf before cultivation.

Hydroponic
cultivation at high concentration of CDs was carried out for the purpose
of finding the fluorescence of CDs in lettuce easily. Hence, 4 lettuces
were cultivated for 37 days in this test. After being properly cut
out, 4 purified water bottles (555 mL) were used as growth devices.
All bottles contained 500 mL of full-strength Hoagland nutrient solution,
and two of them contained 1 mg/mL CDs. The control lettuces were named
0–1 and 0–2, and the experimental ones were named 1–1
and 1–2 (Figure S10). The nutrient
solutions were replaced on the 17th day. The frequency of adding water
was every 2 days in the first half of the hydroponic cultivation period,
and this was changed to every day in the second half. The total light
intensity was 95 μmol m–2 s–1. The other conditions were the same as those in the above-described
cultivation with a low concentration of CDs.

Characterization of CDs
HRTEM and TEM images of CDs
were obtained with a JEOL-2100F microscope operated at 200 kV. FTIR
spectrum was measured by a Nicolet 6700 infrared detector (Thermo
Fisher Scientific). The fluorescence spectrum was recorded on a HITACHI
F-7000 fluorescence spectrophotometer. UV–vis optical absorption
spectrum was taken with a Shimadzu UV-2550 UV–vis spectrophotometer.
The QY of the CDs was measured by a fluorescence spectrophotometer
and UV–vis spectrophotometer. Photographs were taken with a
mobile phone. XPS study was performed on a Kratos Amicus spectrometer
equipped with conical anode Mg Kα radiation. Peak positions
were internally referenced to the C 1s peak at 284.6 eV. The production
yield of the CDs was measured with the help of weighting bottles (25
mm × 25 mm) and a Biocool FD-1A-50 freeze dryer.

Characterization
of Rome Lettuce
Four lettuces in each
repeat group were harvested randomly and wiped with tissues. The shoot
FW, shoot and root DW, shoot water content, and specific leaf weight
were measured. Shoot DW and root DW were obtained by desiccation in
an oven at 75 °C for 3 days. By punching the third leaf (counting
from the bottom up without 2 cotyledons) 5 times in each lettuce using
a puncher with a radius of 3 mm, 20 wafers were obtained in each repeat
group and dried in an oven at 75 °C for 2 days. After calculating
the ratio of DW and area, the specific leaf weight was obtained.

For the morphology indices of lettuces of the above biomass indices,
the number of leaves longer than 5 cm was counted (without 2 cotyledons).
In addition, the leaf length, leaf width, and leaf area of the third
leaves were measured by CAD 2016 after taking photos horizontally
in the same place with the background of coordinate papers. The leaf
length, leaf width, and leaf area of the 11th leaves (counting with
the naturally deciduous leaves, without 2 cotyledons) of 4 lettuces
with a high concentration of CDs were measured as replacements for
the naturally deciduous fifth one.

Quality indices were determined
using the third leaf; liquid nitrogen
was used after washing, and the material was stored at −16
°C. All tests were measured by UV–vis spectrophotometer
and repeated three times. In addition, specific steps are presented
in the Supporting Information.

Molybdenum
blue colorimetry was used to measure the content of
AA with a slight modification.39 SS content
was obtained by modified anthrone colorimetry.36 SP content was measured by Coomassie brilliant blue G-250
staining with a slight modification.40 Nitrate
content was evaluated by the modified method of Cataldo with a slight
modification.41

The photosynthetic
pigment contents of the right middle parts of
the fresh third leaf in each lettuce, containing Chl a, Chl b, TChl,
and carotene, were extracted with 25 mL of 80% (v/v) acetone and measured
by the method of Lichtenthaler.42 The absorbance
of the solutions was read at 470, 646, and 663 nm against the solvent
blank (80% acetone) by using the UV–vis spectrophotometer.
Contents of each pigment were calculated by equations listed in the Supporting Information.

All photosynthesis
indices, Pn, Tr, Gs, and Ci, were measured by
a PP Systems TDS-2 portable photosynthesis system on the last day
of cultivation indoors. The tested parts were the right middle sections
of the fifth leaf of 3 lettuces in every repeat group.

The pH
and EC of the nutrient solution were tested by a HANNA Instruments
HI98129 portable analyzer every 2 days when the pumps had worked for
half an hour after adding water or replacing nutrient solution.

For fluorescence microscopy images, after harvest, the lettuces
cultivated with a high concentration of CDs were washed with deionized
water 5 times. Then, the roots, stems, and leaf veins of the 11th
leaf were cut into slices and observed on a Leica DM5000 B fluorescence
microscope both in bright field and UV (360 nm). All images were taken
at 10 magnification with 6.15 and 64.0 ms of exposure time for bright
field and UV, respectively. The exposure time was 3.89 ms for the
stems in bright field.

Data Statistics
A Nano Measurer
1.2.5 was used to measure
the particle size distribution and interplanar spacing of CDs. All
of the data were subjected to one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA)
and Duncan test at the a < 0.05 level by SPSS17.0
to calculate the standard deviation and significant difference, although
the latter one could not be implemented at high concentration if there
were fewer than 3 study groups. Bars labeled with the different letters
are significantly different (a < 0.05) according
to the Duncan test.
