This study presents a first
report on ruthenium-catalyzed asymmetric transfer hydrogenation (ATH)
of levulinic acid (LA) to chiral γ-valerolactone (GVL). ATH
of LA has been explored with Noyori’s chiral catalyst (Ru–TsDPEN)
in methanol solvent. Efficacy of ATH reaction of LA was investigated
under different reactions conditions such as temperature, catalyst,
and hydrogen donor concentration. The effect of various organic tertiary
bases along with formic acid (FA) as a hydrogen donor was studied,
and N-methylpiperidine with FA (1:1 molar ratio)
was revealed as an efficient hydrogen donor for ATH of LA to GVL furnishing
chiral GVL with complete conversion and 93% enantiomeric excess (ee).
This operationally simple and mild ATH protocol was tested for practical
applicability of ATH of LA obtained from biomass waste (rice husk
and wheat straw) and furnished chiral GVL with 82% ee.

Introduction
Petrochemical feedstock
is a major pillar for the synthesis of
different chemicals and is playing a crucial role in today’s
economy. Depletion of fossil resources is increasing day by day which
imposes the development of new routes to synthesize chemicals and
fuels from renewable resources such as biomass. Several industrially
feasible methods have been developed in this perspective to generate
new platform chemicals from biomass.1−13 One of the most favorable approaches to produce value-added chemicals
is the selective biomass conversion.14−19 Several important platform chemicals are obtained through this route,
for example, 5-hydroxymethyl furfural, succinic acid, levulinic acid
(LA), γ-valerolactone (GVL), and so forth. Among them, GVL has
been identified as a potential green biofuel since long,20 and it is used for various applications. Literature
reveals that a variety of catalysts and different systems have been
developed for LA hydrogenation to GVL,21 but the study regarding hydrogenation of LA to obtain optically
active GVL remains unexplored. Utilization of enantiopure GVL as a
beneficial chiral precursor might be tested in the synthesis of various
fine chemicals and other valuable intermediates like chiral 5-methyl-3-methylenedihydrofuran-2(3H)-one, pentane-1,4-diol, and its derivatives, unsaturated
esters, chiral ionic liquids, and so forth.22,23 Optically active (S)-GVL has been used to synthesize
various pharmaceutical compounds such as the aggregation pheromone
of Gnathotrichus sulcatus (S)-(+)-sulcatol, a cyclodepsipeptide of marine origin, geodiamolide
A, and the antihypertensive WS75624B, the antileukemic steganacin
(Figure 1).24−27 Apart from its pharmaceutical applications, optically pure GVL bearing
the properties of good salvation could also be utilized as a non-hazardous
and renewable chiral reaction medium for asymmetric synthesis.28 With the successful demonstration of chiral
ionic liquids in the area of asymmetric synthesis,29 applications of chiral 4-hydroxyvalerate-based ionic liquids
derived from chiral GVL as a solvent for chiral induction are also
proposed.30

of optically pure GVL.

Various catalytic processes
have been investigated for the conversion
of LA to GVL with homogeneous31−33 and heterogeneous catalyst systems.34−36 However, the asymmetric reduction of LA to enantiomerically pure
GVL has been demonstrated in very few articles.37−43 Recently, Osawa and Tanabe reported the asymmetric hydrogenation
of LA to chiral GVL with the use of the (R,R)-tartaric acid-NaBr-modified nickel catalyst; however,
the enantioselectivity obtained was moderate [60% enantiomeric excess
(ee)].43 Mika et al. demonstrated direct
asymmetric hydrogenation of biomass-derived LA to chiral (S)-GVL using the SEGPHOS ligand-modified ruthenium catalyst
with 82% enantioselectivity.42 Optically
active γ-substituted γ-lactone synthesis was reported
by Karnik et al. from (S)-menthyl or (S)-bornyl esters of 4-carboxylates by sodium borohydride reduction
with very moderate yield and enantioselectivity of (S)-GVL.39 Enzymatic reduction often results
in excellent enantioselectivity of the products. Hilterhaus et al.
investigated a chemoenzymatic reduction reaction of LA to obtain (S)-GVL in good yields and ee (∼90%).41 Enantioselective hydrogenation of LA esters has been performed
in few research articles with ruthenium as a catalyst.37−39 Vinogradov et al. suggested asymmetric hydrogenation of LA with
the Ru–BINAP–HCl catalyst system in ethanol, pertaining
to the GVL in optical purity up to 99% ee.40 Mineral acid is necessary for ester hydrolysis, and it also presented
with the release of HCl from the reaction mixture. This is a critical
problem from environmental safety concern as aqueous HCl is corrosive
in nature. Jacobs et al. reported the reduction of alkyl levulinate
to its hydroxy esters with Baker’s yeast which upon hydrolysis
furnished (S)-GVL in 73% yield.38 Though there are few reports of asymmetric hydrogenation
of LA to GVL, asymmetric transfer hydrogenation (ATH) of LA in the
presence of chiral ligands has not been explored till date. ATH is
a very efficient method to obtain chiral compounds under mild reaction
conditions.44−49 ATH is one of the most competent strategies for hydrogenation of
prochiral compounds because of its operational ease and prevention
of the use of perilous hydrogen gas and the pressure vessels.44−49 Herein, we investigated ATH of LA by using various chiral metal
complexes to obtain optically active GVL. Among various chiral catalysts,
RuCl-(R,R)-TsDPEN was found to
be the best catalyst leading to chiral GVL in 97% yield and 93% ee.

Results
and Discussion
To begin this study, we have performed ATH
of LA to optically active
GVL with different chiral catalysts (Scheme 1). In this study, we have used commercially
available and most successful catalysts reported for ATH reactions
based on the platinum group metals with a variety of chiral chelating
ligands and donor atoms such as nitrogen and oxygen (Figure 2).

Figure 2 Various chiral metal
complexes used for ATH of LA to GVL.

Scheme 1 ATH of LA to Chiral GVL Using Chiral Catalysts
ATH reaction was performed with an azeotropic mixture
of formic
acid (FA) and triethylamine (TEA) as a hydrogen donor, that is, FA/TEA
(5:2) and methanol as a solvent. It was observed that the LA was successfully
converted to GVL with the use of tosylated diamine ligands in the
presence of Ru, Rh, and Ir catalysts (Table 1).

a Reaction conditions: LA: 0.5 mmol,
MeOH: 1.5 mL, catalyst: 0.005 mmol, FA/TEA (5:2): 0.5 mL, temp: RT.

ATH of LA to GVL proceeded
in very good yield of 99 and 64% ee
within 48 h reaction time using the Ru–TsDPEN catalyst (Table 1, entry 1). With catalyst 2, conversion of LA was 99% but with very low enantioselectivity
36% was observed (Table 1, entry 2). Tethered catalyst complex 3 was effective
in producing GVL with complete consumption of LA but provided chiral
GVL with only 39% ee (Table 1, entry 3). Ru–benzene complex 4 was moderately
active in converting the LA to GVL with 68% conversion and only 2%
ee (Table 1, entry
4). With catalyst 3, conversion was good (99%) and moderate
ee value (62%) was observed (Table 1, entry 5). Catalysts 6 and 7 with Rh and Ir metals were found to be active in hydrogenating LA
to GVL with 99% conversion (Table 1, entry 6, 7), but ee values were very low (6–9%)
as compared to the Ru catalyst precursor.

It is demonstrated
in earlier results that asymmetric reduction
reaction of aliphatic ketones results in a lower enantioselectivity
value as compared to aromatic ketones, and enantioselectivity is governed
by vicinal functional groups around the carbonyl group. It is presented
in the previous reports that activity and enantioselectivity differed
when reaction was performed with in situ generated and preformed catalyst
complexes.50 Hence, ATH of LA was tested
with in situ generated and preformed complexes.

To our surprise,
the enantioselectivity value was dramatically
influenced, giving GVL with 66% ee with preformed catalyst complex 1 and with in situ generated complex furnished GVL with 54%
ee (Table 1, entry
1 and 8). ATH of LA was also performed with the in situ generated
ruthenium complex using a [Ru(p-cymene)Cl2]2 catalyst precursor and (1S,2S)-TsCYDN 8 as a ligand, but the reduction
product formed was low (29%) and enantioselectivity was very poor
(36%) (Table 1, entry
9). To gain more insight on the enantioselectivity pattern, ATH of
LA was performed under different reaction conditions. Among all the
catalysts screened, the catalyst 1 was found to be active
and hence further optimization of LA to GVL was performed with this
catalyst with FA/TEA as a hydrogen donor.

It was previously
reported in the literature that conversion of
LA to chiral GVL proceeds through a hydroxy-pentanoic acid intermediate,
and the 18O-labeled study of (S)-GVL confirmed
that the ring opening and reclosing had no effect on the enantiopurity
of (S)-GVL.42 The ATH
of LA reaction is believed to proceed through the ATH of carbonyl
functionality in LA to get hydroxy-pentanoic acid and then dehydration
of hydroxy-pentanoic acid leads to the formation of GVL.

The
chiral diamine Ru–TsDPEN complex acts as a bifunctional
catalyst48,49 and is highly chemoselective for the ATH
of the C=O functional group. It was already well studied that,
in the mechanism of ATH reaction (Scheme 2);46−49 the reaction of HCO2H with the Ru–TsDPEN 1 complex proceeds in a stepwise manner by deprotonation of
FA to form an ion pair intermediate, leading to the kinetically favorable
formate complex B. The resulting formate complex then
forms the amine hydrido Ru complex C upon decarboxylation
of B. The NH unit bound to the metal center shows an
adequately acidic character to activate the carbonyl group. Amine
hydrido Ru complex C on interaction with the carbonyl
functionality leads to the formation of a reduced chiral product.
Besides inducing enantioselectivity, the chiral ligand accepts and
donates a proton with its basic nitrogen, whereas the hydride is received
and delivered by the transition metal as shown in the possible transition
state in Scheme 2.
However, the study performed by Kuzma et al. established that TEA
merely acts as an acceptor of the chloride ligand from the Ru precatalyst 1.58

Scheme 2 Proposed Mechanism
for ATH of Carbonyl Functionality with Ru Catalyst 1
Solvent plays a significant role in the induction
of chirality
in asymmetric reactions;51,52 hence, we performed
ATH of LA in different solvents at room temperature (RT) (Figure 3). ATH of LA reaction
under neat conditions proceeded with low conversion, and no enantioselectivity
was observed. A possible reason for the low conversion under neat
reaction conditions could be the increased acidity of the reaction
mixture which hampers the active form of the ruthenium catalyst. Further
in the investigation of the solvent screening, different polar, apolar,
protic solvents were screened for ATH reaction of LA with catalyst 1, and it was observed that reaction proceeded with complete
conversion and excellent ee of 64% in methanol solvent. As stated
in our earlier publication, methanol could act as a co-solvent and
increase the yield and enantioselectivity of ATH reaction, thereby
improving the stability of the catalyst.53 ATH of LA was not effective in dimethyl sulfoxide solvent and led
to only 12% conversion with no ee determined. Enantioselectivity was
slightly affected with the use of different solvents for ATH of LA
reaction. Polar solvents such as AcCN, dimethylformamide, and alcoholic
solvents were found to be the effective solvents for ATH reactions
and resulted in nearly 99% conversion with a moderate to good (55–72%)
ee value.

0.005 mmol, FA/TEA (5:2): 0.5 mL, S/C = 100, temp: RT.

Temperature of the reaction impacts enantioselectivity in
asymmetric
reactions as it affects polarity, viscosity, and diffusivity. Consequently,
the study of reaction temperature on activity and enantioselectivity
was demonstrated for ATH of LA reaction (Figure 4). Usually, ATH reactions are performed from
RT to 60 °C temperature because further increase in temperature
led to catalyst instability which subsequently proceeds with a low
enantioselectivity value. ATH reaction of LA was conducted from 0
to 60 °C, and it was observed that the conversion increased with
increase in temperature. Remarkably, reaction was unsuccessful below
20 °C temperature and proceeded with efficient conversion and
enantioselectivity above 30 °C. When 0.5 mmol of LA was subjected
under ATH conditions using a Ru–TsDPEN 1 catalyst
at 0 °C, only 39% conversion was obtained with the 21% ee value
after 24 h reaction time. Further enhancement in the temperature to
10 and 20 °C resulted in slight improvement in enantioselectivity
with 46 and 63% values, respectively. Further increase in temperature
to 40 °C gave chiral GVL in 60% ee with 99% conv in 16 h time.
Increase in temperature to 50 °C led to enhanced activity for
ATH reaction, furnishing with 99% conv in 12 h reaction time but with
decreased enantioselectivity to 51%. Optimum conversion and enantioselectivity
was obtained at 30 °C with 99% conv and 70% ee.

ATH reactions of ketones have
been furnished
well with FA/TEA (5:2) as a hydrogen donor (Table 2). Here, we varied the amount of FA/TEA for
ATH of LA to GVL and it is seen that increased FA/TEA donor concentration
leads to increase in conversion; however, enantioselectivity was decreased.
ATH reaction proceeded well with the FA/TEA value of 0.5 mL giving
highest enantioselectivity of 74% for chiral GVL.

The influence of catalyst concentration
on enantioselectivity was
checked for ATH reaction (Figure 5). Remarkable improvement in enantioselectivity was
obtained from 63 to 74% ee when catalyst concentration was increased
from 0.0025 to 0.0075 mmol, respectively. Further increase in catalyst
concentration up to 0.01 mmol provided the GVL in 99% conversion and
78% ee. The result obtained confirms that high catalyst loading leads
to increased enantioselectivity and activity. When 0.5 mmol LA was
subjected under ATH reaction conditions with 0.01 mmol of catalyst 1, complete conversion was detected with GVL formation in
78% enantioselectivity in 18 h reaction time. This confirms that high
catalyst loading leads to increased enantioselectivity and activity
as there is an increase in the number of catalytic sites available
for the substrates to undergo transfer hydrogenation reaction.

Variation of the FA and TEA ratio afforded with remarkable improvement
in activity for ATH of imines and ketones.54−56 Furthermore,
use of different organic bases along with FA as a hydrogen donor for
ATH reactions was found to have strong influence on the enhancement
in activity and enantioselectivity of the desired product.57−59 In our earlier work for ATH of imines, we have reported that FA
in combination with various organic bases works as an efficient hydrogen
donor and resulted in high yields and enantioselectivity in short
reaction time. To shed more light into the effect of various organic
bases with FA as a hydrogen donor, we screened ATH reaction of LA
with few different organic bases (Table 3).

a Reaction conditions: RuCl(p-cymene)[(R,R)-Ts-DPEN]:
0.005 mmol, LA: 0.5 mmol, MeOH: 1.5 mL, FA/base (molar ratio 1:1):
0.5 mL, temp: 30 °C.

When ATH of LA was performed with a FA/TEA ratio of 1:1, complete
conversion with 74% ee for chiral GVL was obtained. With a low FA/TEA
ratio of 0.2, conversion was in the range of moderate value and ee
decreased drastically to 52%. FA with acyclic tertiary amine N,N′-diisopropylethylamine in the
ratios of 5:2, 1:1, and 0.2 were screened for ATH of LA reaction,
and the results were in accordance with the TEA. An equivalent ratio
of FA with the base for ATH reaction of LA resulted in increased enantioselectivity
and activity. Cyclic amines with FA were screened for ATH of LA with
a 1:1 ratio and 0.01 mmol of Ru catalyst 1 and 1 mmol
of LA. Cyclic secondary amines with FA afforded the reduction of LA
with full conversion; however, enantioselectivity was comparable with
the TEA and in the range of 68–69%. Surprisingly, enantioselectivity
was improved significantly to 82% with N-methylpyrrolidine
and 93% with N-methylpiperidine. For example, ATH
of LA was performed with (1:1 molar ratio) FA/N-methylpiperidine
at 30 °C and 1 mmol of Ru catalyst 1, and full conversion
of LA was obtained with 93% ee value in 16 h reaction time. With this
protocol in hand, activity of the catalyst 1 was investigated
for increased substrate concentration from 0.5 to 2 mmol of LA (Figure 6). The TON value
and conversion decreased as LA concentration increased; however, enantioselectivity
was maintained from 93 to 85%. Reaction proceeded well with the use
of FA/N-methylpiperidine (1:1) hydrogen donor, and
93% conversion was obtained with 85% ee for 2 mmol of LA in 36 h reaction
time.

Various esters of LA have been screened under optimized reaction
conditions of ATH reaction (Table 4). All esters were hydrogenated with good yields; however,
enantioselectivity for esters decreased marginally as per the chain
length of the ester group of the LA increased and it was low as compared
to ATH of LA. It was also observed that the stereochemical result
of these reductions was not changed by variation of the ester group.

Thus, a new effective catalyst system
is demonstrated for ATH of
LA to chiral GVL, and the concentration–time (C–T) profile was generated (Figure 7). This developed methodology
asymmetrically reduces the LA under very mild reaction conditions
and with very efficient hydrogen donor FA/N-methylpiperidine.

(molar ratio 1:1): 0.5 mL, LA: 0.5 mmol, temp: 30 °C.

This simple and effective ATH protocol was successfully demonstrated
for ATH of biomass-derived LA using FA/N-methylpiperidine
hydrogen donor using catalyst 1. d-Fructose
(4 gm) was converted to LA based on literature reports31,52 and 1.0 g LA was obtained; 1 mmol of LA was subjected to ATH reaction
with 0.0075 mmol of the Ru catalyst 1 in 1 mL MeOH and 1:1 FA/N-methylpiperidine (0.5 mL) as a hydrogen donor (Scheme 3). Complete conversion
of LA was obtained with 82% enantioselectivity for chiral GVL after
18 h reaction time. Mika et al. have also demonstrated the direct
transformation of LA obtained from a “real” biomass
to optically active GVL by asymmetric hydrogenation with a good enantioselectivity
value.11 Following the same protocol, we
treated the
real biomass waste including rice husk and wheat straw with 2 M H2SO4 at 170 °C for 8 h. After the workup process,60 the obtained brown colored LA was consequently
reduced under optimized ATH reaction conditions (Scheme 4). (Cat 1: 0.0075
mmol, LA: 1 mmol, 1:1 FA/N-methylpiperidine: 0.5
mL, MeOH: 1 mL, temp 30 °C). GVL with 78% enantioselectivity
was obtained with full conversion of LA in 18 h reaction time. Thus,
based on the results obtained, it can be stated that the current ATH
protocol is highly effective and operationally simple in transformation
of biomass-derived LA to enantioselective GVL with 93% enantioselectivity.

Conclusions
Thus,
we have demonstrated an efficient and simple process for
ATH of LA in methanol with F/B as the H-donor and a Ru–TsDPEN
catalyst system and obtained optically active GVL in 98% yield and
93% enantioselectivity. Optimization of different reaction parameters
was performed for ATH of LA to GVL: such as temperature, solvent effect,
hydrogen donors, catalyst, and ligand concentration to get optimized
reaction conditions. Further increment in activity was obtained with
the use of different bases with FA as the H donor. To the best of
our understanding, this study presents the first report of producing
chiral (R)-GVL by ATH of LA using a ruthenium catalyst
precursor (Ru–TsDPEN) and obtained chiral GVL in 93% ee with
99% conversion. Practical applicability of the current methodology
was shown on ATH of biomass-derived LA to GVL and obtained GVL in
78–82% ee.

Experimental Section
All reactions
were performed in oven-dried Schlenk flask. ee analysis
of chiral GVL was performed by gas chromatography (GC) using a chiral
column, and yield was determined by GC–mass spectrometry analysis.
LA, chiral catalyst precursors were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and
used as received. Solvents were obtained from Merck Ltd. and used
as received.

Experimental Procedure for ATH of LA
A Schlenk flask
containing a magnetic stirring bar was charged with catalyst 1 [Ru(p-cymene)Cl(1S,2S)-TsDPEN] (0.0075 mmol) in 1 mL MeOH and LA (1 mmol). The
reaction was started with the addition of (1:1 molar ratio) FA/N-methylpiperidine (0.5 mL). The reaction mixture was stirred
at 30 °C for the time indicated, then basified with 0.5 M Na2CO3 solution, and extracted with dichloromethane
(3 mL × 2 mL). The organic phase was dried over Na2SO4, and solvent was removed under reduced pressure. Conversion
was determined on GC using HP-5 column, and enantioselectivity was
determined on GC using β-DEX 225 (L ×
I.D. 30 m × 0.25 mm, df 0.25 μm).
