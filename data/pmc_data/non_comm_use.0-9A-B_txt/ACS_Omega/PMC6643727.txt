A glass
fiber-epoxy resin (GFER) framework derived from mixed waste
printed circuit boards (MWPCBs) was utilized to prepare a cost-effective,
reusable Mo–Cu bimetallic Bronsted–Lewis solid acid
catalyst through wet-impregnation under near-infrared radiation (NIRR)
activation. The efficacy of the novel Mo–Cu catalyst was assessed
in the synthesis of glucose through hydrolysis of jute (Corchorus olitorius) fiber, and the process parameters
were optimized (Mo precursor loading: 1.0 wt %, catalyst concentration:
5 wt %, hydrolysis temperature: 80 °C, and hydrolysis time: 10
min) through Taguchi orthogonal design. The GFER support and the prepared
catalysts were characterized through thermogravimetric, X-ray diffraction
(XRD), Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR), Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET)–density functional theory, and TPD analyses. The optimal
Mo–Cu catalyst and the GFER support possessed 45.377 and 7.049
m2/g BET area, 0.04408 and 0.02317 cc/g pore volume, 1.9334
and 0.7482 nm modal pore size, and surface acidity of 0.48 and 0.40
mmol NH3/g catalyst, respectively. X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy bands confirmed the coexistence of Mo6+ and
Cu2+ species; XRD and FTIR analyses indicated the presence
of MoO3 and CuO crystalline phases in all prepared catalysts.
The optimal catalyst prepared through NIRR (wavelength 0.75–1.4
μm)-activated hydrothermal treatment resulted in a significantly
greater glucose yield (75.84 mol %) than that achieved (53.64 mol
%) using a conventionally prepared catalyst. Thus, an energy-efficient
application of NIRR (100 W) could significantly improve catalytic
properties over conventional hydrothermal treatment (500 W). The present
investigation provides an innovative application of MWPCB-derived
GFER as a promising cost-effective support for the preparation of
highly efficient inexpensive solid catalysts for sustainable synthesis
of glucose from low-cost waste jute fiber.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Printed
Circuit Board (PCB) is an integral component of any electronic
equipment as it electrically connects and mechanically supports other
electronic components. According to Global E-waste Monitor 2017, globally
44.7 million metric tonnes of e-waste was generated,1 fueling concerns about the growing threats to the environment
and public health. Waste PCBs are still being chiefly disposed in
open air or in landfills that pose grave threat to the environment.
Accumulation of waste PCBs is not only a crisis of quantity but also
an alarming environmental concern because of the presence of toxic
ingredients that results in occupational, environmental, and human
health threats.

Recovery and recycling of the metallic part
from mixed waste PCBs
(MWPCBs) drew the attention of many researchers because of the potential
profitability through metal recovery; however, glass fiber-epoxy resin
(GFER) which makes up around 65–70% of waste PCBs2 has been overlooked because of lesser economic
value. Various separation processes of metal and nonmetallic ingredients
of MWPCBs viz. physical recycling processes (e.g., shredding, hammer
milling, ball milling, corona discharge separation, magnetic separation,
eddy current separation, air classification, flotation, gravity separation,
and density-based separation),3−6 thermal processing (pyrolysis, gasification, and
plasma treatment),7−9 hydrometallurgical processing,10,11 and solvent extraction (dimethyl sulfoxide, dimethyl formamide, N-dimethyl pyrrolidone, and ionic liquids)12−14 had been reported in last few decades. In recent years, hydrometallurgical
processes attracted particular attention for the treatment of WPCBs.
Several researchers reported the effectiveness of strong acids as
a leachant for leaching of metals from waste PCBs; nevertheless, the
generation of toxic gases (viz. Cl2, SO3, and
NOx) and the acidic waste streams during
the leaching process are detrimental to the environment. Jadhav et
al.11 deployed a less hazardous organic
acid viz. citric acid (0.5 M) along with hydrogen peroxide (1.76 M)
as an effective leachant that rendered complete metal leaching to
obtain GFER from a 4 × 4 cm2 WPCB in 4 h.

Several
scientific reports have been published on direct reutilization
of GFER for the production of fuels (pyrolytic oil) and chemicals
by thermal and catalytic pyrolysis; however, focus has been shifted
toward the recovery of the GFER for alternative uses because of the
low energy efficiency of the pyrolysis process. Although, various
applications of GFER have been reported (e.g., as adsorbent and activated
carbon),15−17 nonetheless, to date, the application of GFER as
a cost-effective support for the preparation of a metal-impregnated
solid acid catalyst has not been reported.

Notably, hydrolysis
of lignocellulosic biomass (LB) for maximization
of monosaccharide yield in a sustainable way is one of the most investigated
arenas. Jute fiber [65–70 wt % cellulose 20–25 wt %
hemicellulose and 10–12 wt % lignin]18 could be exploited as a feedstock for hydrolytic conversion into
glucose because of its high cellulosic content. Very scanty works
have been reported on jute hydrolysis for glucose production. Roy
et al.19 obtained a maximum of 50% yield
of a reducing sugar from pretreated jute powder using immobilized
enzymes, while Matsagar et al.20 reported 86% furfural yield from jute employing 1-methyl-3(3-sulfopropyl)-imidazolium
hydrogen sulfate ([C3SO3HMIM][HSO4]) brønsted acidic ionic liquid catalyst at 433 K and 1 h. Evidently,
inadequate research studies have been performed on glucose production
from jute fiber notwithstanding its high cellulose content.

LB can be hydrolyzed using a homogeneous21 or heterogeneous acid catalyst to obtain important platform chemicals
which can be further treated to generate biofuel and value-added chemicals.22,23 However, in recent years, heterogeneous acid catalysts have been
observed to be advantageous over homogeneous catalysts owing to convenience
of product separation, less corrosiveness, and minimal waste stream
generation.24 Heterogeneous catalysts such
as supported metal oxides can be catalytically active for cellulose
conversion.25−27 Takagaki et al.25 demonstrated
water-tolerant HNbMoO6 catalyst for the production of glucose
from saccharides. A study revealed that 0.2 g of HNbMoO6 catalyst can render 24.1 mmol g–1 glucose from
sucrose in 1 h and 373 K, whereas 6.6 mmol g–1 glucose
was produced using the commercial Amberlyst-15 catalyst. Another work
reported by Hegner et al.26 revealed that
Nafion and FeCl3 supported on amorphous silica could produce
glucose with a maximum yield of 9% from cellulose at 463 K in 24 h.
Thus, it can be perceived that although supported metal oxide acid
catalysts are efficient, nevertheless, hydrolysis of LB requires severe
reaction conditions. Accordingly, several researchers investigated
the application of microwave radiation (350 W)28 and ultrasonication (750 W)29 to augment the hydrolysis reaction; still these require high energy
input, which in turn makes the overall process economically ill favored.

Applications of waste-supported photocatalysts30 and bimetallic photocatalysts31 in photodegradation of organic pollutants and water splitting were
reported by several researchers, although very scanty works on biomass
hydrolysis have been found.32

This
article primarily envisages the preparation of a catalyst
support (GFER, containing Cu) from WPCBs using less a hazardous organic
acid (viz. acetic acid) instead of using conventional toxic mineral
acids (e.g., HCl and H2SO4). A highly proficient
and cost-effective Mo–Cu-doped GFER-supported solid acid catalyst
was prepared by an energy-efficient near-infrared radiation (NIRR)-activated
hydrothermal treatment through functionalization of GFER with [CH3COCH=C(O−)CH3]2MoO2. The efficacy of the prepared novel catalyst has been estimated
through optimization [by Taguchi orthogonal design (TOD)]33 of pretreated jute fiber (PJF) hydrolysis under
NIRR to maximize glucose selectivity.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Effects of Process Parameters
on the PJF Hydrolysis
Process
Table 1 represents individual ranks of process parameters affecting the
response variable (GNIRR) based on Δ-values
and SN ratios, where the factor corresponding to the maximum Δ-value
has been ranked 1. Furthermore, from analysis of variance (Table S1) for the jute hydrolysis process, it
can be observed that the hydrolysis temperature (ϕTNIRR) and Mo precursor loading (ϕNIRRMo) were statistically
significant process variables at 95% confidence level (p-value < 0.05). Thus, from Table 1, it may be concluded that L0 of ϕNIRRMo (1.0 wt %), L0 of ϕMoC (5
wt %), L1 of ϕTNIRR (80 °C), and
L–1 of ϕtNIRR (10 min) were the
optimum process values rendering maximum glucose yield.

2.2 Interactive Effects of Process Parameters
on PJF Hydrolysis
Parametric interaction for the PJF hydrolysis
process has been depicted in Figure 1. Interaction between Mo loading and catalyst concentration
(remaining two parameters at the optimum level) revealed that an increment
in Mo precursor loading resulted in a higher glucose yield (GNIRR) [Figure 1A] at all levels of catalyst concentration, which clearly
suggested that the prepared Mo–Cu-impregnated GFER catalyst
immensely favored PJF conversion. A similar trend was observed for
all values of catalyst concentration. From, Figure 1(B) it can be concluded that the hydrolysis
process was endothermic in nature as the hydrolysis temperature monotonically
enhances GNIRR. On the other hand, hydrolysis
time has an antagonistic effect on GNIRR because of the degradation of glucose at higher hydrolysis time Figure 1E. The individual
parametric effect on GNIRR has been presented
in the Supporting Information (Figure S1).

2.3 Catalyst Characterization
2.3.1 Thermogravimetric Analysis
The
thermogravimetric (TGA) patterns (Figure 2) of MWPCB powder, GFER, CCu–Mo1.0, and NCu–Mo1.0 manifest the thermal stability
and decomposition of samples on heating over a range of temperature
from 30 to 500 °C. The TGA thermogram of MWPCB and GFER shows
a major weight loss (35%) over 280–450 °C, which is ascribed
to the degradation of epoxy resin. Furthermore, thermal decomposition
of GFER was faster compared to MWPCB powder because of the chemical
treatment (shown in FTIR spectroscopy). On the other hand, relatively
less weight loss occurred in NCu–Mo1.0 and CCu–Mo1.0 because of the ionic polymerization of epoxy resin. Moreover,
the TGA plot of NCu–Mo1.0 reveals a weight loss
of 2 wt % over 220–250 °C, which corresponds to the decomposition
of the precursor, that is, bis(acetylacetonato)dioxomolybdenum(VI)
(decomposition temperature 228–229 °C), that leads to
the liberation of carbon oxides, acetone, methane, and isobutene.34 Notably, NCu–Mo1.0 shows better
thermal stability compared to CCu–Mo1.0, which reveals
better thermal activation of NIRR over conventional hydrothermal treatment
in catalyst preparation. Thus, 240 °C was selected as the calcination
temperature to prepare the GFER-supported Cu–Mo catalyst to
avoid degradation of epoxy resin. Notably, as the hydrolysis temperature
was appreciably lower (60–80 °C) than the calcination
temperature, thermal decomposition of the developed catalysts is unlikely
during the hydrolysis process.

Figure 2 TGA analysis of MWPCB, GFER, NCu–Mo1.0, and CCu–Mo1.0.

2.3.2 X-ray Diffraction
Figure 3 depicts the X-ray diffraction
(XRD) patterns for GFER powder and calcined samples [Mo-free GFER,
NCu–Mo0.75, NCu–Mo1.0, NCu–Mo1.25, and CCu–Mo1.0]. Peaks representing
the crystalline phase of copper oxide (37.264°, 43.303°,
and 48.799°),35 molybdenum trioxide
(13.76°),36 and molybdenum disilicide
(29.94°) were detected for all catalysts. The diffraction patterns
evidence the presence of copper (43.28°, 50.39°, and 74.12°)35 in GFER powder, which is attributed to the existence
of copper oxide in all catalysts and calcined Mo-free GFER samples.
Notably, with increasing [CH3COCH=C(O−)CH3]2MoO2 loading (Figure 3), the prominence of MoO3 and
MoSi2 peaks gradually increases in the NCu–Mo catalyst
which in turn increases the acidity of the catalyst. Furthermore,
the presence of a more intense peak of molybdenum trioxide was also
found in NCu–Mo1.0 and NCu–Mo1.25 compared to CCu–Mo1.0.

2.3.3 FTIR Spectroscopy
Fourier transform
infrared (FTIR) analysis of GFER and all catalyst samples shows prominent
peaks of OH stretching located at 3568.12 cm–1 because
of the formation of hydroxyl-containing silanol groups, which signifies
the porous structure of the samples.37 Vibrations
regarding the C–H stretch of aromatic and alkane groups are
observed at wavelengths 3058.89 and 2970.13 cm–1, respectively.37 Other adsorption peaks
at 1454 and 1510.41 cm–1 are also assigned to the
stretching vibration of C–C and C–H bands of alkane
and aromatic38 groups, respectively (Figure 4A). On other hand,
the intensity of the strong band located at 2970.13 cm–1 in the GFER support has been significantly reduced after calcination
at 240 °C (Figure 4). Furthermore, reduction of absorption peaks at 1760.23 and 1660.65
cm–1 (symmetric stretching of the epoxy ring) for
the catalyst samples suggests the ring-opening cleavage of the epoxy
groups by [CH3COCH=C(O−)CH3]2MoO2.39 Furthermore,
the vibration at 996.71 cm–1 in the catalyst samples
indicates the presence of Mo which gradually increases with Mo precursor
loading.40

(E) NCu–Mo1.25.

2.3.4 NH3-TPD
Figure 5 shows several NH3-TPD peaks within the temperature range of 150–260 °C
for the catalyst and calcined GFER samples. The presence of weak acidic
sites in all samples at 215 °C is ascribed to Cu2+ ions,41 whereas acidic peaks positioned
above 235 °C have been assigned to Mo6+ ions.42 Moreover, with Mo precursor loading, the presence
of new acidic-site peaks was observed in all catalyst samples, whose
intensity increases with Mo precursor loading up to 1.0 wt %. Decrease
in acidity of the NCu–Mo1.25 catalyst may be due
to the substantial loss of Bronsted acidic sites on the GFER surface
as Mo6+ replaces the Bronsted acidic sites.43 Notably, at 1.0 and 1.25 wt % precursor loading,
NIRR-activated catalysts shows higher acidity compared to CCu–Mo1.0 (Table 2), which advocates that NIRR has caused better hydrothermal activation
during catalyst preparation compared to the conventional heating protocol.

GFER.

2.3.5 FTIR-Pyridine
The nature of the
acid sites of NCu–Mo1.0, CCu–Mo1.0, and calcined GFER has been further studied by FTIR-pyridine analysis
(Figure 6). The presence
of absorption peaks of a pyridinium ion at 1538 and 1447 cm–1 for calcined GFER is attributed to the Bronsted acid and Lewis acid
sites, respectively.44 The spectrum of
NCu–Mo1.0 and CCu–Mo1.0 catalysts
also shows bands at 1538 (Bronsted site) and 1447 cm–1 (Lewis site) along with a band at 1488 cm–1 that
is assigned to the intermediate Bronsted and Lewis acid sites.45 From Figure 6, it can be seen that the Bronsted acid capacity of
NCu–Mo1.0 and CCu–Mo1.0 increases
compared to calcined GFER, which may be due to the development of
polymolybdate Keggin structures.46 Furthermore,
under NIRR, relocation and dispersion of active sites (Mo6+ and Cu2+)47 occur that create
new pores in the GFER framework, which eventually act as Bronsted
acid centers owing to the presence of water. Bronsted acidic sites
are beneficial to LB hydrolysis for conversion to glucose.48 Notably, NIRR also stimulates inaccessible Cu2+ to come out from the internal surface to the exterior of
the catalyst,47,49 thus rendering more accessibility
to Cu2+, which in turn increases Lewis acidity and thus
overall acidity. Consequently, increment in overall acidity could
be achieved in the case of the NIRR-radiated catalyst compared to
the conventionally prepared catalyst.

2.3.6 Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
Analysis
Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) analysis
method was
employed to determine the specific surface area of the catalysts and
GFER support. Table 2 demonstrates the substantial increase of the specific surface area
of the optimal NCu–Mo1.0 catalyst (45.377 m2/g) compared to the GFER support (7.049 m2/g).
During the calcination step, liberation of carbon oxides, acetone,
methane, and isobutene created new pores in the catalyst matrix, which
in turn enhanced the surface area of the NCu–Mo1.0 catalyst; the results of the present study corroborate well with
the findings of El-Molla et al.50 The shape
of the adsorption isotherm of the optimal catalyst NCu–Mo1.0 corroborates type I isotherm (IUPAC) (Figure 7) implying monolayer adsorption.
Density functional theory (DFT) method was employed to evaluate the
NCu–Mo1.0 catalyst pore volume (0.04408, 0.02317
cc/g for GFER) and modal pore diameter (1.9334, 0.7482 nm for GFER)
(inset of Figure 7).
Furthermore, from Figure 8, it can be observed that 51.11% micropores and 48.89% mesopores
were present in the NCu–Mo1.0 catalyst. Notably,
as the size of the water molecules were smaller (0.275 nm) than the
pore diameter of the NCu–Mo1.0 catalyst, adsorption
of water molecules easily occurred on the surface of the developed
catalysts which augmented the hydrolysis reaction.

pressure (P/P0) of the
optimum catalyst NCu–Mo1.0 [inset: DFT pore size

2.3.7 Scanning
Electron Microscopy
The
scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the optimum NCu–Mo1.0 catalyst after calcination at 240 °C are depicted
in Figure 9, which
shows irregular rod-shaped fiber glass particles partially surrounded
by epoxy resin. Microscopic observation suggests that the formation
of Lewis acidic sites and Bronsted acidic sites occurred on the partially
exposed fiber glass surface.

2.3.8 Transmission Electron
Microscopy Analyses
The morphology of GFER, NCu–Mo1.0, and CCu–Mo1.0 was further investigated
by transmission electron microscopy
(TEM) analysis (Figure 10). With Mo precursor doping to GFER, a clear contrast enhancement
was found in Figure 10B,C as compared to Figure 10A. A careful inspection of Figure 10A–C reveals the transformation of
surface morphology; NCu–Mo1.0 possesses more porous
structures in comparison with GFER and CCu–Mo1.0. The high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image (Figure 11A) of the NCu–Mo1.0 catalyst
exhibits the presence of MoO3 and CuO crystallites by white
and red rectangles, respectively. The lattice spacing of 0.231 nm
corresponds to the (111) plane of CuO crystallites (JCPDS: no. 48-1548)
(indicated by the inclined lines in Figure 11B) while the lattice spacing of 0.63 nm
represents the (020) plane of MoO3 (indicated by the inclined
lines in Figure 11C).

2.3.9 X-ray
Photoelectron Spectroscopy
Figure 12 displays
the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) diagram of the Taguchi-derived
optimum NCu–Mo1.0 catalyst for the jute hydrolysis
process (A and B). XPS spectra detect two doublets at 234.67 and 237.84
eV corresponding to Mo6+ 3d3/2 and Mo6+ 3d5/2, respectively.51 The
preceding peaks indicate the higher oxidation state of Mo (MoO3) in the prepared NCu–Mo1.0 catalyst. In Figure 12B, the XPS spectra
depict that Cu 2p3/2 (II) lies at 936.76 eV and with one
shake-up satellites at a higher binding energy 944.84 eV, which is
attributed to CuO.52 Considering these
observations, it might be concluded that Cu2+ species existing
in the prepared NCu–Mo1.0 enhanced the catalyst
acidity (0.48 mmol NH3/g catalyst) vis-à-vis catalytic
activity. From the experimental result of PJF hydrolysis (Table 4), it may be inferred
that an increase in the Mo precursor up to 1.0 wt %, that is, [CH3COCH=C(O−)CH3]2MoO2 loading could improve the catalytic performance, which signifies
that Mo6+ detected in XPS analysis was the major active
phase in the PJF hydrolysis process to yield glucose.

2.3.10 Reaction
Mechanism
The Mo6+ and Cu2+ active
phases present in the prepared
catalyst (NCu–Mo1.0) both behave as Lewis acid,
whereas Bronsted acidic sites were also present on the prepared catalyst
surface.43 Additionally, Mo-free calcined
GFER has resulted in 44.36 mol % GNIRR yield, whereas when a Mo6+ ion was introduced in the
GFER framework, the resultant catalyst renders a remarkably higher GNIRR yield (75.84 mol %). The catalytic hydrolysis
mechanism of PJF was depicted in Figure 13, which suggests that initially water molecules
(0.275 nm) are adsorbed on the catalyst surface (pore dia. 1.9334
nm) and form a hydronium ion which in turn resulted in the formation
of H+ and OH– ions. Notably, cellulose
molecules did not adsorb on the catalyst surface which is attributed
the fact that the H+ ion attacks the cellulosic structure
(1,4-β glycosidic linkage) which leads to the formation of glucose
molecules.

2.3.11 Catalytic Performance of the NCu–Mo1.0 Catalyst on the PJF Hydrolysis Process
To understand
the efficacy of the optimum NCu–Mo1.0 catalyst,
hydrolysis of the PJF was also conducted using calcined GFER, CCu–Mo1.0, and commercial catalyst Amberlyst-15 (surface area: 45
m2/g, pore size: 25 nm, acidity: 4.8 mmol/g catalyst) at
the TOD-derived optimal condition. NCu–Mo1.0 shows
better activity in terms of glucose yield (75.84 mol %) over Amberlyst-15
(GNIRR: 61.53 mol %); CCu–Mo1.0 (GNIRR: 53.64 mol %) and calcined
GFER (GNIRR: 38 mol %). The high catalytic
activity of NCu–Mo1.0 over Amberlyst-15 can be attributed
to the light-absorbing ability of the prepared catalyst due to the
presence of CuO and MoSi2.53,54 The UV–vis
spectra of NCu–Mo1.0 exhibit a UV absorption peak
(200–400 nm) in addition to an absorption hump within the visible
range (between 550 and 700 nm) of electromagnetic spectra (Figure S2). PJF hydrolysis conducted under conventional
heating (500 W) using NCu–Mo1.0 rendered maximum
63.16 mol % glucose yield in comparison with 75.84 mol % obtained
under NIRR at the TOD-derived optimal condition. Thus, the light absorbing
ability of the prepared catalyst was evident. Furthermore, from Figure 14, it can be observed
that Amberlyst-15 renders better GNIRR yield compared to CCu–Mo1.0 after 5 min of hydrolysis
reaction, which may be due to the leaching of −SO3H group from the Amberlyst-15 framework55 (acts as a homogeneous catalyst). Notably, it should be also mentioned
that the optimum glucose yield (75.84 mol %) was much higher compared
to the yield reported in the previous work (50 mol %).19

2.4 Hydrolysate
Characterization
2.4.1 FTIR Analyses of the
Hydrolysate
The hydrolysate obtained from PJF hydrolysis
at the optimum condition
was analyzed through FTIR spectroscopy and compared with the characteristic
peaks of standard glucose. A prominent peak at 3424.18 cm–1 was attributed to the stretching vibrations of O–H group56 while stretching vibrations at 2965.51 and 2936.85
cm–1 confirm the presence of CH groups.57 Additionally, the presence of H–C–H
group was observed at 1422.36 and 1463.45 cm–1.
The peaks at 1618.32 and 1206.68 cm–1 could be ascribed
to C=C and C–O–C bonds, respectively.58 Furthermore, the peaks at 744.62 and 610.87
cm–1 indicated the presence of few aromatic functional
groups.59 Thus, Figure 15 clearly manifested that these infrared
spectra indicate the existence of representative functional groups
of glucose in the hydrolysate. Moreover, higher intensity of infrared
spectra for the hydrolysate obtained from NCu–Mo1.0-hydrolyzed PJF compared to the hydrolysate for CCu–Mo1.0 indicates the efficacy of the NCu–Mo1.0 catalyst over CCu–Mo1.0.

standard glucose; hydrolysate obtained from
(B) NCu–Mo1.0-catalyzed hydrolysis; and (C) CCu–Mo1.0-catalyzed hydrolysis at optimum process conditions.

2.4.2 HPLC
Analyses of Hydrolysates
The
hydrolysate obtained from NCu–Mo1.0- and CCu–Mo1.0-catalyzed PJF hydrolysis at an optimal condition was quantified
by employing high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) (Figure 16). Hydrolysate
constituents such as 5-HMF, xylose, and glucose were retained at 23.83,
9.84, and 9.26 min, respectively.60,61 The glucose
concentration was remarkably higher (68 wt %) compared to 5-HMF (12
wt %) and xylose (21 wt %) for the NCu–Mo1.0-catalyzed
PJF hydrolysis process.

hydrolysis of PJF at optimum process conditions.

2.5 Catalyst Reusability
The reusability
of the prepared optimal catalyst NCu–Mo1.0 was evaluated
by taking seven consecutive experimental runs at the optimal PJF hydrolysis
condition. After each hydrolysis step, the catalyst was easily recovered
by screening (mesh size: 200 μm) the oven-dried (at 105 °C
for 1.5 h) hydrolysis residue. The hydrolysate yield decreased from
75.84 to 71.39% after fourth recycle (fifth batch) while no further
decrease in glucose yield was observed in subsequent three more reaction
cycles. Inductively coupled plasma (ICP)-optical emission spectroscopy
of the reused catalyst reveals that an insignificant amount of active
sites (0.11 ppm) has been leached from NCu–Mo1.0, while CCu–Mo1.0 suffered leaching up to 1.76
ppm, which corroborates well with the results of Zhao et al.;51 this further reinforces the superiority of NIRR
over CH.

3 Conclusions
Waste
PCB-derived epoxy-glass fiber (GFER)-supported Mo–Cu
Bronsted–Lewis acid catalysts can be developed employing both
NIRR and conventional hydrothermal treatment. The NIRR-promoted catalyst
shows superiority over conventional hydrothermal-treated catalyst
in terms of catalytic properties and glucose yield in the jute fiber
hydrolysis process. Effects of process factors on glucose yield have
been studied using analysis of variance and optimized through TOD.
The waste PCB-derived GFER could be used as a catalyst support to
produce the cost-effective Mo–Cu catalyst. Thus, waste PCBs
can be effectively exploited in developing reusable, highly efficient
supported acid catalyst, hence creating another an effective avenue
of e-waste valorization for the generation of value-added chemicals
from LB.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Chemicals
and Materials
Bis(acetylacetonato)dioxomolybdenum(VI)
[[CH3COCH=C(O−)CH3]2MoO2], acetic acid, hydrogen peroxide, acetone, DNS (dinitro
salicylic acid), aqueous NH4OH (25%), and so forth were
purchased from Merck, and all chemicals used were of analytical reagent
grade. The MWPCBs were collected from a local scrap market at Kolkata,
India. The Jute fiber was also purchased from a local market.

4.2 MWPCB Processing
The attached parts,
viz. RAM, PCI slot, and chip slots were removed manually from the
collected MWPCB (computer, TV, other electrical, and electronics component),
and the MWPCB was ground into fine powder (150 μm mesh size)
using a drum sander and laboratory ball mill. Afterward, the ferrous
materials were removed using a magnetic stirrer. Subsequently, 1 M
NaOH solution was added for the removal of tin, aluminum, and lead
through sedimentation. Powder MWPCB (5 g) was stirred with 100 mL
of 1 M NaOH solution for 4 h at 50 °C for the complete removal
of tin, aluminum, and lead. Then, the glass fiber, epoxy resin, and
copper mixture were separated and collected and sent for oven drying.
Afterward, copper was removed by stirring the NaOH-treated MWPCB with
100 mL of 1 M acetic acid and 10 mL of H202 solution
for 4 h. Finally, the glass fiber, epoxy resin, namely, the nonmetallic
part (GFER) was collected and oven-dried (105 °C) and eventually
used for catalyst preparation (Figure 17).

Figure 17 Flow Chart for MWPCB processing.

4.3 Catalyst Preparation
With a measured
amount of prepared dry powder GFER [containing Cu (0.65 wt %; measured
by ICP)] from MWPCB, varying precursor loads of [CH3COCH=C(O−)CH3]2MoO2 were added, and the mixture was
stirred vigorously in acetone for 4 h at 60 °C under NIRR (100
W; near-infrared wavelength: 0.75–1.4 μm). Subsequently,
the mixture was ripened for 24 h and eventually oven-dried (105 °C).
Afterward, Mo-dispersed GFER was calcined at 240 °C for 3 h,
and accordingly, GFER-supported Cu–Mo catalysts prepared through
NIRR were designated as NCu–Mo0.75 (Mo precursor
loading 0.75 wt %), NCu–Mo1.0 (Mo precursor loading
1.0 wt %), and NCu–Mo1.25 (Mo precursor loading
1.25 wt %). Furthermore, to assess the effect of NIRR on catalytic
properties, a GFER-supported Cu–Mo catalyst was also prepared
through conventional hydrothermal treatment (500 W) at optimum (1
wt %) loading and designated as CCu–Mo1.0, and its
performance has been evaluated in the jute hydrolysis reaction. Thus,
NIRR consumed 80% less energy compared to conventional heating in
hydrothermal treatment.

4.4 Characterization of GFER
and the Prepared
Catalyst
TGA analysis of the MWPCB, oven-dried GFER powder,
calcined GFER, and prepared Mo–Cu catalyst was performed with
a PerkinElmer TGA analyzer (Pyris Diamond TG/DTA) in a nitrogen atmosphere
(20 mL/min) from 30 to 500 °C with a temperature increase rate
of 15.0 °C/min. The infrared spectra of the MWPCB, GFER powder,
calcined GFER, and prepared Mo–Cu catalyst were detected with
FTIR-SHIMADZU (Alpha), from 400 to 4000 cm–1, while
the XRD patterns of the samples were analyzed using a Cu Kα
source equipped with an Intel CPS 120 hemispherical detector. XRD
Analysis was performed at 2θ ranging from 10° to 90°
at a scanning speed of 1° min–1. The specific
surface area, pore volume, and pore size distribution were measured
by BET and DFT methods using Quantachrome Instruments, Nova 4000e.
Before BET–DFT analysis, the samples were pretreated and degassed
at 150 °C to remove surface moisture. The acidity of the catalysts
and calcined GFER was determined through NH3-TPD experiments
using Quantachrome Instruments, TPR win v2.1. Furthermore, the Bronsted
and Lewis acidic sites of the optimum catalyst and calcined GFER were
evaluated by FTIR spectrometry.62 The samples
(30 mg) were pressed into self-supporting discs (diameter 1.2 cm)
and outgassed under vacuum (10–5 mbar) at 200°
C for 2 h. Adsorption of pyridine on the outgassed samples was saturated
at a pressure of 5 mbar for 10 min, and after adsorption of pyridine,
the samples were further outgassed under vacuum at 100 °C for
30 min to remove the physiosorbed pyridine. The binding energy of
Mo 3d and Cu 2p of the optimum catalyst was measured by XPS, while
surface morphology of the optimum catalyst was determined using SEM
at 15 kV (JEOL Ltd., JSM-6360). Additionally, TEM and high-angle annular
dark-field scanning TEM (HAADF–STEM) analysis were carried
out also on a FEI Titan G2 60 -300 transmission electron microscope
at an accelerating voltage of 300 kV. The lattice spacing of the crystallites
was calculated using a “GATAN digital micrograph” through
processing the micrographs. The photocatalytic property of the optimum
NCu–Mo1.0 catalyst and calcined GFER was verified
with a PerkinElmer Lamda-365 UV–visible spectrophotometer in
the range 200–900 nm.63

4.5 Reactor Configurations and Hydrolysis Procedure
The
performance of the prepared NCu–Mo catalyst was evaluated
in the jute hydrolysis process. One-pot pretreatment-hydrolysis of
jute fiber was performed in a batch reactor assisted with an NIRR
(100 W; 0.75–1.4 μm) system. For pretreatment, a measured
amount of jute fiber was taken in a three-neck flask, followed by
addition of a measured amount of aqueous NH4OH (2.5 mL/g
of jute fiber) and deionized water (20 mL/g of jute fiber) at a preset
controlled temperature of 70 °C. Over the specified time span
of 20 min, the mix was stirred at 400 rpm. After pretreatment, the
purging of N2 through one neck of the three-neck flask
was carried out to remove remaining ammonia. Afterward, a measured
amount of the prepared catalysts and water (10 mL/g of jute fiber)
was added to the PJF present in the reactor mix and stirred at 400
rpm for the subsequent hydrolysis over a specified time (Table 3). Subsequently, vacuum filtration was conducted to separate the jute
fiber residue and the catalyst. Afterward, the filtrate was processed
for the measurement of glucose concentration by a standard DNS method.
Moreover, to identify the efficacy of optimum NCu–Mo catalysts
over CCu–Mo and Amberlyst-15 on hydrolysis, pretreated jute
was hydrolyzed using these catalysts at the otherwise TOD-predicted
optimal condition. The hydrolysate was analyzed for glucose yield
to compare with that of catalytic hydrolysis.

4.6 Design
of the Experiment
The efficacy
of the prepared catalysts was tested in the PJF hydrolysis reaction
deploying the following four independent process factors viz., Mo
loading (ϕNIRRMo), catalyst concentration (ϕMoC), hydrolysis temperature (ϕTNIRR), and
hydrolysis time (ϕtNIRR).

Using L9 TOD (Minitab
Inc. USA for Windows 7), nine experimental runs (Table 4) were conducted to assess and
optimize the effects of independent process factors on the response
variable (glucose yield, GNIRR). The optimal
process factors corresponding to maximum GNIRR were determined through evaluation of signal-to-noise (S/N) ratios
(employing the “larger is better” criterion) (eq 1) and analysis of variance
(ANOVA). 1  where r is the number of
experimental runs performed at a particular set condition (Table 4), j is the number of replications, and GNIRR,j is GNIRR corresponding
to run r.

4.7 Physicochemical Characterization
of the Hydrolysate
Hydrolysate concentrations were evaluated
by the DNS method.64 The compositional
analysis of the hydrolysate
was performed by HPLC with an RI detector (PerkinElmer 200 Series)
along with a 300 × 7.8 mm Bio-Rad HPXP, 9 μm column and
0.005 M sulfuric acid as the mobile phase (flow rate: 0.6 mL min–1). The hydrolysate constituent concentrations were
quantified from the calibration plots of respective standard constituents.
The infrared spectra of the liquid hydrolysate were also analyzed
by FTIR spectroscopy (FTIR-Shimadzu Alpha, from 400 to 4000 cm–1).
