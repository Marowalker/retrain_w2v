Plants
produce a wide variety of secondary metabolites in response
to adverse environmental factors. Z,Z-Farnesyl diphosphate (Z,Z-FPP),
synthesized by Z,Z-farnesyl diphosphate
synthase (zFPS), supports the formation of phytochemicals
in wild tomatoes. Here, the crystal structure of N-terminal truncated zFPS (ΔzFPS) was determined. Irregular
products including lavandulyl diphosphate and an unknown compound
were surprisingly found. Apart from the truncated N-terminus as a
functional regulator, structure-based analysis and mutagenesis assays
revealed a residue H103 in ΔzFPS as one of
the key elements to this irregular function. A series of substrate–enzyme
complex structures were obtained from ΔzFPS-H103Y
by co-crystallizing with isopentenyl diphosphate, dimethylallyl thiolodiphosphate,
or both. Various substrate-binding modes were revealed. The catalytic
mechanisms of both the head-to-tail and head-to-middle reactions in
ΔzFPS were proposed. Functional switch between
the two mechanisms in this enzyme and the essential role played by
the flexible C-terminus were elucidated as well.

Introduction
Terpenoids are among
the most important metabolites in plants.
They play various roles, such as mediating defense or beneficial interactions.1−6 Prenyltransferases (PTSs), which are also known as isoprenyl diphosphate
synthases, catalyze the formation of the upstream substrates for terpene
synthases (TPSs).3 The reaction begins
with dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP) and isopentenyl diphosphate
(IPP), which are synthesized from acetyl-CoA via the mevalonate pathway
in most animal and fungal cells or from carbohydrate derivatives via
the methylerythritol phosphate pathway in bacteria and plant chloroplasts.6−9 PTSs catalyze consecutive prenyl chain elongation via nucleophilic
attack to the initiatory substrate, resulting in trans (E) or cis
(Z) products,10,11 which differ in their molecular
geometry. Regarding the three-dimensional folds of the enzymes, the
α-helical bundle is generally adopted by trans-PTS.12,13 For cis-PTS, a Rossmannlike
fold is presented,14,15 in which the dimeric enzyme takes
the shape of a butterfly composed of a pairing domain and a catalytic
domain.

The terpenoids identified to date are mostly derived
from the trans-type
substrates. Knowledge about cis-PTS is rather limited.
The zFPS protein in this study is a short-chain cis-PTS from the glandular trichomes of the tomato species Solanum habrochaites. Its major product, Z,Z-FPP, is an important precursor for
the formation of phytotoxins with vital defense roles in wild tomato.16,17 The crystal structure of zFPS, lacking the transit
peptide and an additional 27 residues on the N-terminus, was determined,
named ΔzFPS. To obtain substrate–enzyme
complex structures, the ΔzFPS-H103Y mutant
was designed by structure-based sequence alignment with other homologous
enzymes. From this mutant, a series of substrate–enzyme complex
structures were obtained and the irregular head-to-middle function
was also revealed. Both the head-to-tail and head-to-middle condensation
reactions are elucidated from the complex structures. The results
provide new insights into the study of the highly diverse cis-PTS family.

Results and Discussion
The full-length
enzyme includes an N-terminal chloroplast-targeting
peptide predicted to be 45 amino acids in length.16 The N-terminal 45-residue truncated clone, which was expressed
and purified, was named zFPS directly. Because no
crystal was obtained from this clone, an additional N-terminal 27-residue
truncation was made and named ΔzFPS, which
was successfully crystallized. This apo-form ΔzFPS crystal (ΔzFPS-APO) belonged to the P43212 space group, with one protein
molecule in an asymmetric unit (Table 1; see crystallographic information files in the Supporting Information). Similar to the structures
of other cis-PTSs, the overall fold of ΔzFPS is Rossmannlike (Figure 1A). Two dyad-related monomers are associated into a
dimer via hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions. This dimeric
structure is consistent with the results of the sedimentation velocity
(SV) analysis (Figure S1). However, we
were unable to obtain the complex structure after testing a series
of substrates or substrate analogues, including IPP, ISPP (isopentenyl
S-thiolodiphosphate), DMSPP, GPP (geranyl diphosphate), and ibandronate.

b The stereochemistry of the model
was validated with PROCHECK.

To obtain complex structures, catalytic residues around the active
site were examined. Four catalytic residues including N134, H103,
S131, and R137 of ΔzFPS, corresponding to N74,
H43, S71, and R77 from an undecaprenyl diphosphate synthase (UPPS),18 potentially serve as general bases or acids
for the chemical reaction. These catalytic residues are highly conserved
in the cis-type PTS family, except the position ΔzFPS-H103. Indeed, this positon is frequently replaced by
Tyr in other homologous enzymes (Figure S2). Using the ΔzFPS-H103Y mutant, complex structures
were successfully obtained (see below) and the enzyme function was
altered as well. Irregular products including LPP (Peak-4), an unidentified
Peak-3 compound, and the monoterpene limonene (Peak-5) were found,
with the native function retained (Figures 2 and S4). On the
basis of the NIST Standard Database, the most reasonable candidate
for Peak-3 is the monoterpene “menthol”, which showed
the same retention time as that for Peak-3; however, the similarity
of the mass spectra is too low (around 30%). The Peak-5 limonene is
a cyclized terpenoid compound.

mutant ΔzFPS-H103Y. The peaks are identified
as follows: 1, Z,Z-farnesol; 2,
nerol; 3, unidentified irregular product; 4, lavandulol; and 5, limonene.

Most TPS structures share a common α-helical TPS fold.19,20 However, di-TPS Rv3378c from Mycobacterium tuberculosis was found to adopt the same Rossmannlike fold as that by cis-PTS.21 Cyclization function
in cis-PTS is rare, but it was reported in a cyclolavandulyl
diphosphate synthase22 (CLDPS). A structure-based
sequence comparison revealed the conserved character among the same
corresponding positions Rv3378-Y51, CLDPS-Y26, and Y103 from ΔzFPS-H103Y. On the other hand, the Peak-4 LPP is an irregular
prenyl diphosphate, synthesized by the head-to-middle condensation
reaction from DMAPP molecules.22,23 We supposed that a
similar irregular reaction is adopted for the formation of unknown
Peak-3. Unlike ΔzFPS-H103Y, the two irregular
products were significantly reduced in ΔzFPS
when IPP was provided. However, without IPP, ΔzFPS produced the two irregular products dominantly (Figure 2).

Three complex structures
were successfully determined, including
ΔzFPS-MI (ΔzFPS-H103Y/Mg2+/IPP), ΔzFPS-MDI (ΔzFPS-H103Y/DMSPP/Mg2+/IPP), and ΔzFPS-MD (ΔzFPS-H103Y/DMSPP). All complex structures
belonged to the P212121 space group, with one protein dimer per asymmetric unit and
crown-ether molecule(s) bound to the surface lysine (Figures 1A and S5A,B).

Two substrate-binding sites can be discerned:
an S1 site for the
binding of the initiatory substrate and an S2 site for the successive
isoprene units.18 The ligand in the S1
site interacts with the side chains of N88, R89, R90, Y103, L106,
and R137. Among these, L106, which regulates the product chain length
in zFPS,17 is also crucial
for ligand positioning. Two
alternative binding modes potentially representing the transient binding
states of the β-phosphate group from the S2 ligand were observed
(Figure 1C), which
may be regulated by the side chains of S131, R249, R255, and S257.
The side chain from N134 interacts with both the α-phosphate
group and the allylic tail from the S2 ligand.

The ΔzFPS-MI and ΔzFPS-MDI structures
suggest that N134 can serve as a general base
for proton removal from the S2 ligand (Figure 1D). The N atom and the O atom of the side
chain from N134 are close to the diphosphate group and the C2/C4 atom
of the ligand, respectively. Nucleophilic attack at the C1 atom of
the S1 ligand by the π-electrons from the S2 ligand results
in condensation. In ΔzFPS-MDI, with a distance
of 2.9 Å between the C4 atom from the S2 ligand and the C1 atom
from the S1 ligand, head-to-tail condensation occurs. For the head-to-middle
condensation reaction, the distance between the C2 atom of the S2
ligand and the C1 atom of the S1 ligand is 4.9 Å. ΔzFPS-MI shows an even longer distance. The ligand positioning
seems to be more favored for the head-to-tail condensation by the
short reacting distance. The occurrence of the head-to-middle condensation
function may need a greater potential in the ionization of the S1
ligand.

The catalytic mechanism of head-to-middle condensation
was proposed
previously in a lavandulyl diphosphate synthase24 (LPPS, PDB ID: 5HC6), a cis-PTS with 39% amino acid sequence
identity to zFPS. Superposition of LPPS and ΔzFPS-MDI showed a highly conserved active site, with most
substrate-binding residues identical (Figure S6A). The corresponding position of zFPS-H103 is LPPS-H93.
Two catalytic residues in the S1
site are different: zFPS-R90/LPPS-L80 and zFPS-N88/LPPS-H78 (Scheme 1). According to our complex structures, zFPS-R90 potentially regulates the opening/closing of S1 site (Figure 1B,C). LPPS-L80 may
play a similar role. On the other hand, as proposed previously, LPPS-H78
is the key catalytic residue for the head-to-middle reaction in LPPS,
facilitating the diphosphate release from the S1 ligand.24 However, in ΔzFPS, the
corresponding position of LPPS-H78 is ΔzFPS-N88.
Alternatively,
the Y103 residue of the ΔzFPS-H103Y mutant
can play a crucial role in the ionization reaction of the diphosphate
group (Scheme 1). In
contrast, H103 in the ΔzFPS structure (ΔzFPS-APO) forms a hydrogen bond with E141, which inhibits
the bonding between H103 and the diphosphate group from the S1 ligand
(Figure 1D). The head-to-middle
reaction is much less favored under this situation. As the enzymatic
assays showed, ΔzFPS catalyzed head-to-middle
condensation only in the absence of IPP (Figure 2). The elimination function served by Y103
in ΔzFPS-H103Y may also contribute to the small
amounts of limonene found in the product profile. Revealed by structural
comparison, the residue served for the diphosphate elimination in
di-TPS Rv3378c is Y5121 and the corresponding
position is close to Y103 in ΔzFPS-MI (Figure S7).

Scheme 1 Catalytic Mechanisms of ΔzFPS
The head-to-tail condensation
mechanism in cis-PTS, as proposed previously,18 starts
with the binding of an allylic ligand in the S1 site. The homoallylic
ligand then binds to the S2 site in the form of a MgIPP complex for
the successive reaction. However, from the ΔzFPS-MD complex structure, only the S2 site was occupied by one DMSPP
molecule, which may represent the starting configuration for head-to-middle
catalysis. This binding was initially assisted by the side chains
of E133 and Y266, and C-terminal R296 from the neighboring monomer
(Figure S5C). A second DMAPP molecule accompanied
by Mg2+ then moves into the S1 site.

The adverse
turn of the binding order for the head-to-middle reaction
may be attributed to the S1 ligand (Figure S8), in which ready ionization of the diphosphate group is crucial.
The reactive nature of the S1 ligand would result in an unstable binding;
thus, the binding sequence is opposite compared to that in the head-to-tail
reaction. We suppose that both of the binding sequences for head-to-tail
and head-to-middle condensation reactions can be adopted in ΔzFPS.

The final coverage of the catalytic pocket is
accomplished by the
extended C-terminal segment from the neighboring monomer (Figure 1B). The backbone
of G299 on the terminus stabilizes the S2 ligand, and the side chain
of R297 binds to two water molecules of the Mg2+-coordinated
complex. The Mg2+ ion will eventually migrate to the diphosphate
group of the S1 ligand and then leave as a MgPPi complex.18 The elongated product then occupies the S1 site
for the subsequent reaction. The C-terminal segment is crucial because
the ΔzFPS-H103Y/R297A mutant was inactivated,
a tremendous loss of activity in ΔzFPS-H103Y/R296A
was also observed (Figure S3E,F).

Most PTSs reported to date are classified with a specific functional
mechanism. However, a cis-PTS from Methanosarcina acetivorans was identified that naturally
synthesizes both head-to-tail and head-to-middle reaction products.25 Using a structural approach, the potential of
the multifunctional character of ΔzFPS was
brought to light. The 103 position in zFPS is not
the only factor to regulate the functional specificity. With the N-terminal
segment retained, the enzymatic assay showed no irregular products
in zFPS (Figure 2). On the basis of the crystal structures of ΔzFPS-MI and ΔzFPS-MDI, the 23-residue
N-terminus might be able to extend to the active site of the neighboring
monomer near the C-terminus, and this N-terminal segment is one of
the important functional regulators of zFPS, apparently
inhibiting the occurrence of the head-to-middle condensation reaction.
However, traceable amounts of the irregular products can still be
detected when DMAPP was provided in excessive concentration (Figure S3B). The reason why zFPS could not be crystallized without the N-terminal truncation is
likely the flexibility of this segment, which probably restricts the
binding of IPP in the S2 site.

Conclusions
In the present study,
the head-to-middle condensation function
was observed in the N-terminal truncated ΔzFPS. High substrate specificity was demonstrated in this enzyme as
the
irregular function only occurs without the presence of IPP. The regulatory
nature of this enzyme was characterized on the basis of the structural
information obtained from complex structures accompanied by mutagenesis
and enzymatic assays. Catalytic mechanisms of both the typical head-to-tail
and irregular head-to-middle condensation reactions were proposed.
The regulatory role played by the residue at positon 103 in zFPS was elucidated as well. These findings contribute to
furthering our understanding about the formation of highly diverse
prenyl phytochemicals.

Methods
Protein Expression and
Purification
The nucleotide
sequence of ΔzFPS from tomato lacking the N-terminal
segment (residues 1–70) with the double mutations D71M and
E75A was synthesized on a codon-optimized basis of the Escherichia coli translational system (http://www.genscript.com). As
the native hydrophilic N-terminal is flexible, which may have a negative
effect on crystallization, we had mutated the two residues to hydrophobic
methionine and alanine to improve the crystal packing. The obtained
nucleotides were then cloned into the pET-32 Xa/LIC vector (www.merckmillipore.com),
which includes a Factor Xa cleavage site between the upstream His-tag
and the downstream coding sequence. The same expression strategy was
applied to the mutants in this study. The mutants obtained from site-directed
mutagenesis were produced using PCR-based methods by the following
primers (3′–5′): ΔzFPS-H103Y,
forward primer: CGTTTCGGAAGGTTATAAACACCTG; reverse primer: CAGGTGTTTATAACCTTCCGAAACG.
ΔzFPS-H103Y/R296A, forward primer: GCAGCGTCATGCTCGTTTTGGTGGTCACACG;
reverse primer: CGTGTGACCACCAAAACGAGCATGACGCTGC. ΔzFPS-H103Y/R297A, forward primer: GCAGCGTCATCGTGCTTTTGGTGGTCACACG;
reverse primer: CGTGTGACCACCAAAAGCACGATGACGCTGC. All PCR reactions
were performed using high-fidelity DNA polymerase KOD-Plus following
the manufacturer’s instructions (www.toyobo-global.com).
The obtained PCR products were then digested by DpnI (www.neb.com) at 37 °C
for 1 h and transformed into E. coli DH5α cells for plasmid production.

Each constructed
clone was transformed into E. coli BL21
(DE3) cells for protein expression. The cells were grown to A600 of
0.6 at 37 °C in LB medium containing 50 μg mL–1 of ampicillin, induced with 0.5 mM isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and grown for 16 h at 16 °C. They
were then harvested by centrifugation at 6000g at
4 °C, resuspended in 50 mL of extraction buffer (25 mM tris-base,
pH 7.8, 500 mM NaCl, 10 mM imidazole), and broken by a French Press
(Constant Systems Ltd). For protein purification, the lysates were
recovered by centrifugation at 20 000g for
40 min at 4 °C. ΔzFPS or ΔzFPS mutants with N-terminal thioredoxin and His-tag fusion
in supernatants were then applied to binding columns with nickel-nitrilotriacetic
acid (Ni-NTA) agarose resin (https://www.qiagen.com). The imidazole concentration of the wash buffer was increased to
40 mM, and the recombinant protein fractions were eluted at an imidazole
concentration between 50 and 70 mM. After processing by Factor Xa
protease digestion to remove the N-terminal fusion tags (www.neb.com), the mixtures were then
passed through a second Ni-NTA column to remove the uncleaved fusion
protein and free fusion tags. The purified protein was concentrated
to 10 mg mL–1 in a buffer solution of 25 mM tris-base,
pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analyses
were performed to demonstrate the protein purity. The purified proteins
were frozen with liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C.

Crystallization and Data Collection
Crystals of ΔzFPS (ΔzFPS-APO) and ΔzFPS-H103Y (ΔzFPS-M) were grown by
mixing 2 μL of protein with 2 μL of reservoir solution
using the sitting-drop vapor diffusion method at 18 °C. The ΔzFPS crystals were obtained in a reservoir solution of 70%
2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol (MPD), 0.1 M Tris, pH 8.0. The ΔzFPS-H103Y mutant was crystallized in a reservoir solution
of 5% (w/v) PEG 8000, 40% MPD, 0.1 M cacodylate, pH 7.0. Complex crystals
of ΔzFPS-MI (ΔzFPS-H103Y/Mg2+/IPP), ΔzFPS-MD (ΔzFPS-H103Y/DMSPP), and ΔzFPS-MDI (ΔzFPS-H103Y/Mg2+/DMSPP/IPP) were obtained with
reservoir solution of 13% PEG10k, 20 mM 18-crown-6,26 0.1 M MES, pH 6.5. All diffraction data were collected
using X-rays of wavelength 1.000 Å, recorded at cryogenic temperatures
with a cryoprotectant solution of 20–25% glycerol. Data of
ΔzFPS-APO were collected at the beamline BL5-A
of the Photon Factory in Japan, with an ADSC Quantum 315r CCD detector.
Data for the apo-form ΔzFPS-H103Y crystal were
collected at the beamline BL12B2 of SPring-8 in Japan, using an ADSC
Quantum 210 CCD detector. Data for other complex crystals including
ΔzFPS-MI and ΔzFPS-MD
were collected using the beamline BL15A1 of the National Synchrotron
Radiation Research Center (NSRRC) in Taiwan. The ΔzFPS-MDI complex data was collected at the NSRRC Taiwan Photon Source
(TPS) beamline TPS-05A with a Rayonix MX300-HS CCD detector. All diffraction
data were processed and scaled using the HKL2000 program.27

Structure Determination and Refinement
All crystal
structures in this study were determined by molecular replacement
using the MOLREP program of the CCP4 program suite.28 The E. coli UPPS (PDB code: 1JP3) was used as the
initial search model. Both ΔzFPS and ΔzFPS-H103Y crystals belong to space group P43212, with one protein molecule in an asymmetric
unit. The complex structures, ΔzFPS-MDI, ΔzFPS-MI, and ΔzFPS-MD, were crystallized
in space group P212121, with two molecules per asymmetric unit. Throughout the refinement,
5% of randomly selected data were set aside for cross-validation with
Rfree values. Manual modifications of the models were performed using
the program Coot.29 Difference Fourier
(Fo-Fc) maps were calculated to locate the solvent molecules. All
crystal structures were refined using Refmac5,30 including individual isotropic B-factor refinement. The
molecular figures were produced using UCSF Chimera.31

In Vitro Enzymatic Assays
Enzymatic
assays were performed
in 1 mL of 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.8, containing 100 mM KCl, 7.5 mM MgCl2, 5% (w/v) glycerol, and 5 mM DTT. For each assay, 50 μg
of zFPS, ΔzFPS or ΔzFPS mutants was incubated at 32 °C for 2 h, with different combinations
of DMAPP, IPP, neryl diphosphate (NPP), and GPP (www.echelon-inc.com) at 65
μM. The reaction products were then dephosphorylated by adding
20 units of alkaline phosphatase (www.neb.com) and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. The final products were extracted
three times, each by vortexing with 2 mL of pentane. After separating
the water phase by centrifugation, the obtained organic phase was
then concentrated to 10 μL. The products were analyzed on an
Agilent 5975C Series GC/MSD. The samples in pentane were injected
directly into the GC–MS system. Separation was assured with
a DB-5 capillary column (J&W Scientific; 30 m, 0.25 mm inside
diameter). The temperature program used was isothermal 70 °C
for 2 min, followed by a linear gradient (8 °C min–1) to 250 °C. Mass spectra from NIST Mass Spectral Library and
authentic standards were used for product confirmation. Authentic
standards including lavandulol, farnesol, limonene, and α-terpineol
were purchased from Sigma (www.sigmaaldrich.com), and Z,Z-farnesol was purchased from Echelon (www.echelon-inc.com).

Analytical
Ultracentrifugation
The SV experiments were
performed at 50 000 rpm using a 4-hole AnTi60 rotor at 20 °C
in a Beckman Optima XL-I AUC equipped with absorbance optics. The
purified ΔzFPS samples were collected and diluted
to different concentrations: 1, 0.5, and 0.1 mg mL–1, in a protein storage buffer (25 mM tris-base, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM
DTT, pH 8.0). Standard 12 mm aluminum double-sector centerpieces were
filled with protein solution, with a reference cell containing the
blank buffer. Quartz windows were used with absorbance optics (OD
280) in a continuous mode without averaging. No time interval was
set between scans. The data were analyzed with a c(s) distribution
of the Lamm equation solutions calculated using SEDFIT Version
14.1 (http://analyticalultracentrifugation.com). Software Sednterp (http://www.jphilo.mailway.com) was used to estimate the protein partial specific volume (Vbar),
buffer density (1.0051 g mL–1), and buffer viscosity
(0.0102331 P) at 20 °C.
