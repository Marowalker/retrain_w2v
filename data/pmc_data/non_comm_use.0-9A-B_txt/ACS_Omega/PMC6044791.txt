Single-walled carbon nanotubes
(SWCNTs) are synthetic materials that hold great promise for electronics
that are smaller and more versatile than the current silica-based
technologies. But as-produced SWCNTs are generally a mixture of nanotubes
with different structures that have vastly different properties. Separating
these SWCNTs from multiwalled and metallic carbon nanotubes is vital
to explore their individual properties and commercial utility ranging
from optics to semiconductors. Compounding the problem of commercial
investigation is that the semiconducting SWCNTs are also a mixture
of different diameters and/or chiralities with different properties.
Analyzing properties of enriched semiconducting SWCNT chiralities
has only recently been possible through separation techniques such
as aqueous two-phase solvent systems. Our study illustrates a semipreparative
spiral countercurrent chromatography (CCC) separation of a commercial
mixture of SWCNTs into distinct enriched fractions. A new mixer–settler
spiral disk rotor was applied in this study, in which we compare the
enriched SWCNTs for their effectiveness in biosensors with a high-throughput
model assay, followed by antibody-mediated detection of Escherichia coli. Our results demonstrate that CCC-enriched
responsive SWCNTs for biosensors can be used in our model assay, as
well as for the detection of E. coli. To date, we believe that this is the first study along with Liu
et al. [Chirality-controlled
synthesis of single-wall carbon nanotubes using vapour-phase epitaxy . Nat. Commun. 2012 , 3 , 1199 23149724 ] to demonstrate a specific utility
of separated SWCNT species.

Introduction
Natural and man-made pure carbon compounds
including graphene,
fullerenes, and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) show great potential for a
wide variety of applications ranging from solid-state physics to medicine.
In particular, CNTs have received a great deal of attention due to
their mechanical strength and electronic properties. These carbon
compounds are poised to replace silicon in the inexorable march toward
smaller, more efficient, and more compact electronic instruments.

CNTs are carbon–carbon extended polymers in two dimensions
with fused sp2 orbitals that have aromatic properties.1,2 The sheets form long nanotubes of various diameters from less than
1 nm to a few hundred nm and have lengths of 500 nm to several hundreds
of μm. Nanotubes are generally distinguished as being single-walled
CNTs (SWCNTs) or multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs), but both can
have anisotropic structures and properties. The hexagonal array of
the carbon atoms can have a left-handed or a right-handed spiral pattern.
The dimensions and directionality of the patterns of the hexagonal
honeycomb-like lattice are described by vectors, with certain values
of m and n dictating their chirality
and properties.3,4 Over 12 distinct SWCNT chiral
types or chiralities have been reported to date,5,6 but
the commercial utility of these chiralities has not been explored.

SWCNTs can exhibit conductive or semiconductor properties depending
on their chirality. These semiconductor properties can provide very
fast and sensitive electronic detection in disparate applications,
such as field-effect transistors (FETs), nanoscale sensors, conducting
films, optimized near-IR fluorophores, and drug conjugates.6−9 While these specific properties of SWCNTs are still being envisioned
for commercial applications, there is a dearth of chiral SWCNTs in
the research marketplace.

Although methods to seed and grow
homogeneous SWCNT chiralities
are still being developed, they have not yet reached the stage of
mass production.10 Therefore, the capability
to isolate chiral SWCNT dispersions for uses such as electronic circuits
will be greatly aided by a scalable and cost-effective chromatographic
separation. Chiral SWCNTs have been separated by differential gradient
ultracentrifugation.3−5 It was reported that column chromatography using
agarose, Sephacryl, and other dextran (DEX)-related solid supports
achieved separation of semiconducting CNTs and metallic species, but
these have yet to be scaled up for commercial applications11−17 and were not tested for their potential in specific commercial applications.

Aqueous two-phase extraction methods using DEX can separate CNTs
by diameter, and their ability to bind detergents has been previously
demonstrated.18−21 The use of DEX-based solvent systems and detergents as agents for
selective extraction can be readily adapted to the countercurrent
chromatography (CCC) liquid–liquid partitioning system, which
is carried out in a long tubing or flow path to separate molecules
in the two-phase solvent systems configured for maximum separation.
CCC with the use of spiral-design rotors, introduced by Ito in the
last few years, is very optimal for the preparative separation of
proteins, the large biomolecules.22−26 The primary advantage of these
rotors, including the mixer–settler spiral disk rotor, is that
the retention of the high-viscosity aqueous two-phase solvent (ATPS)
system is high, that is, 60–80% of the stationary phase at
moderate flow rates, which is not possible in the other types of CCC
instruments. This has made possible its application to large molecules27 and now the CNTs. This indicates that CCC has
significant capabilities to increase the resolution and achieve high
mass recovery of semiconducting SWCNTs out of commercial preparations.

Here, we investigate a new improved spiral-design rotor with more
clarified CCC procedures to purify a commercial preparation of SWCNTs.
An application that is readily testable is their use in CNT-FET biodetectors.

A variety of protein-detection methods have been developed for
real-time analysis, which eliminates the need for labeled detector
molecules such as secondary antibodies. Such label-free detection
methods can dramatically cut the time and cost associated with many
assays by removing reagents and instrumentation needed for labeling
and imaging. Fast, real-time, and quantitative information on biomarkers
is believed to be a critical step toward efficient personalized medicine.
Label-free detection of proteins can be achieved through FETs, including
CNT-FET.28−34

Using previously characterized circuitry templates to add
SWCNTs,30−34 we developed a model assay using an organic protonated polymer (polybrene)
to mimic the changes in resistance due to protein binding to the nanotubes.
This model assay is fast, easy to perform, and saturable. Our model
assay was performed on the SWCNT fractions isolated by CCC and showed
a clear difference in the response of enriched SWCNT chiralities.
The enriched light-blue SWCNTs showed a greater response in our model
assay. To verify that the model assay was reflecting real-world conditions,
we coated antibodies to an infectious Escherichia coli strain onto circuits treated with the same enriched SWCNTs and measured
the resistance. Our results show that the model assay directly correlates
to the real-world E. coli detection.

Taken together, these data show that SWCNT functional assays can
be performed directly on enriched SWCNT fractions. Simple model assays
like the one described here will undoubtedly speed the characterization
and properties of individual SWCNT chiralities.

Results and Discussion
The need for separating as-produced semiconducting SWCNTs according
to their chiralities is a bottleneck that slows their development
as next-generation nanoelectronics because different SWCNT chiralities
have different properties.35,1−3 Many SWCNT separation methods based on classical methods have not
translated to commercially available collections of SWCNT chiralities.
Existing methods for obtaining single-chirality SWCNT purification
are cumbersome, often requiring large-volume extraction steps. In
addition, the effect of the SWCNT purification media on direct applications
of SWCNTs has, in many cases, not been fully explored.

In contrast
to column chromatography that uses a solid adsorptive
support, CCC uses a pair of immiscible solvents, one used as the stationary
phase and the other as the mobile phase. One can create a combination
of solvents to form a two-phase solvent system that has suitable solubility
and provides partitioning to separate the components of the sample.
There are many published methods for the different types of molecules.
SWCNTs being extremely hydrophobic long molecules form tight bundles
that are difficult to disperse in organic solvents. These bundles
are most easily dispersed using strong detergents such as sodium dodecyl
sulfate (SDS). CCC has been used to separate proteins with organic–aqueous
solvent systems using detergents forming reverse micelles,36 and two-phase solvent systems with DEX have
been developed with poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) of various molecular
weights (MWs).37,38 Thus, the published CCC literature
contains many methods that can be applied.

The mixer–settler
rotor that CC Biotech has been developing
for large molecules was used in the first published CCC experiment.27 A recently modified mixer–settler spiral
CCC rotor is shown in Figure 1.

Figure 1 Mixer–settler spiral CCC separation rotor described in the Methods section. Side view showing six disks sandwiched
between black Viton gaskets. On the bottom edge, the screws are held
with double nuts instead of nylon bolts to give a more even pressure.

Figure 2A shows
the data of early fractions of a typical CCC separation of a 6,5i
SWCNT preparation in the early stages of the SDS gradient. Low concentrations
of SDS (0.1–0.3%) remove carbonaceous materials from the applied
lower phase. Images of these collected fractions are shown in the
insets. These data show that the early fractions (10–16) form
a dark layer of precipitate between the upper PEG phase (UP) and the
lower DEX layer (LP), indicating that they are not soluble in either
phase with cholate and deoxycholate.

Figure 2 Chromatogram of a typical CCC enrichment
of CNTs. (A) Early phase
of the SDS separation (0.1–0.2%) with photographs of the collected
fractions. UP refers to the PEG-rich upper phase, and LP refers to
the DEX-rich lower phase. (B) Later fractions of the separation with
higher concentrations of SDS (0.3–0.5%). The inset shows photographs
of the fraction tubes.

In the later part of the SDS gradient, distinctly colored
nanotubes
were separated. Figure 2B shows the continuation of the chromatogram in later stages of the
SDS gradient and images of isolated fractions. These data show that
the distinctly colored CNTs are separated into the DEX-rich lower
phase (LP), which is consistent with other studies.39,40 The majority of the chiral species in the 6,5i preparation have
been identified by the manufacturer as (6,5) (41%) and (7,3) (16%).
The species (8,4), (7,5), and (9,2) compose around 5% each, with the
rest (28%) consisting of nine other chiralities. As the spectral properties
of these chiralities have not been thoroughly examined, we attempted
to distinguish them by function.

Different SWCNT colors can
denote different chiralities and distinct
properties. Therefore, we first examined the utility of these fractions
in a model CNT-FET biosensor assay.

Previous studies have shown
that lysine and arginine residues in
proteins are particularly effective in affecting impedance in SWCNT-FETs.41−44 As all arginines and most lysine residues are protonated at physiological
pH, we developed a high-throughput model assay using hexadimethrine
bromide (polybrene) to simulate the effects that proteins have on
SWCNT-FETs. Polybrene is a water-soluble quaternary amine polymer
connected by three and six methylene groups that resemble polypeptide
bonds. In addition, this polymer is inexpensive and readily available
from many chemical vendors.

A key factor in most model and real-world
assay development protocols
for biotechnology is that the assays have to be dose dependent. Demonstration
of assay saturation is vital for biotechnological applications because
it shows that there are concentration-dependent limitations of ligand
binding to a target. A saturable assay also provides limits to maximally
and minimally observable signals that are possible and statistically
relevant.

The impedance of the SWCNT-FETs in the presence of
polybrene is
shown in Figure 3.
The assay involves coating SWCNTs onto a printed circuit as previously
described.30−34 After baseline accrual, 2 μL of polybrene (50 μg/mL
in Di-H2O, final concentration) was added to the circuits
as indicated by the arrow in Figure 3A, which shows a representative trace of the measured
increase in SWCNT-FET impedance with time upon addition of polybrene.
In general, there is a rapid increase in impedance for 15–30
s, followed by tapering of the response. The maximum response is generally
achieved within 1 min of polybrene addition and also for most antibody–antigen
interactions on FETs.30−34 The increase in impedance is reported as increase in signal over
the baseline (normalized impedance).

Figure 3 Effect of polybrene on the impedance of
SWCNT-FETs. (A) Change
in impedance with time after application of polybrene (50 μg/mL,
final concentration). Arrow shows addition of polybrene after baseline
stabilization. (B) Saturation of SWCNT-FET impedance with increasing
concentrations of polybrene. Plotted values are averaged from at least
five independent experiments with standard error of the mean.

To determine whether this polybrene
response was saturable, we
performed a titration of polybrene onto the SWCNT circuits and monitored
the maximum impedance after 1.5 min of adding the polybrene solution.
The results shown in Figure 3B indicate that the polybrene response exhibits a saturation
binding curve. Each point represents at least five independent measurements.
As can be seen in this figure, the SWCNT-FET response saturates at
around 50 μg/mL of polybrene. Saturation of the signal indicates
that all responsive semiconducting SWCNTs that are solvent exposed
are influenced by polybrene. Besides polybrene, we also observed that
other amine-containing materials like polylysine and polymyxin also
gave strong responses on the SWCNT-FET. In contrast, anionic detergents
like SDS and deoxycholate do not elicit a response like polybrene
(data not shown).

To compare a real-world sample to the model
assay, we coated antibodies
against E. coli O103:H8 onto SWCNT-FET
circuits made with SWCNTs from Nano-C (Westwood, MA). We have previously
used antibodies against E. coli O157:H7
coated onto a different preparation of SWCNTs to establish an assay
for bacterial detection using site-specific modification of polyclonal
antibodies for optimal adherence and directionality.33 In this case, shown in Figure 3, we were using a
preparation of semiconducting SWCNT from Nano-C.

To analyze
the properties of the spiral CCC-isolated CNTs using
our model assay, we coated CNT fractions 52–60 directly onto
circuits and measured their impedance. These results are shown in Figure 4.

Figure 4 Assay of semiconductor
activity of fractions 52–60 using
polybrene as described. Dotted line across the graph indicates the
polybrene activity of the starting 6,5i material. Inset shows images
of the CNT fractions tested.

These results demonstrate that there is a clear difference
in the
response of the isolated CNT fractions in the model assay. To determine
whether the model assay reflects real-world biosensor assays, we examined
their response to bacteria binding to CNT-coated circuits. We have previously shown that
CNT-FET circuits can detect E. coli,33 and in Figure 5, we demonstrate that circuits coated with
CNTs from Nano-C using antibodies to E. coli O103:H8 are able to detect 104 cfu/mL of the E. coli.

Figure 5 Detection of E. coli O103H:8 by
SWCNT-FET. The black line shows the increase in impedance upon the
addition of 104 cfu/mL of E. coli O103:H8 to antibody-coated circuits. The gray line (lower) shows
the response of the circuit to 104 cfu/mL of E. coli O103:H8 applied to the circuit without antibody
treatment.

To compare the results of the
polybrene model assay to those of
the bacterial assay, we coated fractions #53 and #55 from the CCC
isolation onto circuits. These fractions represent the highest and
lowest responsiveness, respectively, in the model polybrene assay.
These results are shown in Figure 6 and demonstrate that the polybrene assay corresponds
to the bacterial detection assay.

Figure 6 Detection of E. coli O103H:8 by
SWCNT-FET on fractions 53 and 55, respectively. E.
coli O103:H8 (104 cfu/mL) were added to
antibody-coated circuits.

To further analyze the difference in these isolated CNT fractions,
we compare their spectra. Figure 7 shows the spectra of fractions 53 and 55 and demonstrates
that the light-blue fractions (#52 and #53) are more uniform, consisting
of less than three absorption maxima, compared to that of fraction
#55, which has at least five absorption maxima.

Figure 7 Spectra of fractions
53 (A) and 55 (B).

Whether these CNT species
isolated by CCC have uniform chiralities
will need to be determined in future studies, but it is evident that
CNT species are not equal in activity on FET biosensors. Although
the spectra shown in Figure 7 do not demonstrate SWCNT purity and lack of MWCNT, they do
demonstrate consistency with Figures 4 and 6 in terms of the responsiveness
of the CNT circuits.

Methods
Materials
DEX
MW 75 000 was obtained from Fisher
Scientific (Boston, MA) (Tokyo Chemical Co. manufacturer) or Spectrum
Chemical (Gardena, CA), PEG MW 8000 was from Fisher Scientific or
Spectrum Chemical, sodium cholate (SC), sodium deoxycholate (SDC),
and SDS were from Fisher Scientific or Spectrum Chemical, and CNT
6,5 enriched powder was obtained from South West Nanotechnologies
Inc. (now Chasm Advanced Materials, Norman, OK). Polybrene (hexadimethrine
Br) was purchased from Sigma Chemical Co (St Louis, MO) and dissolved
in H2O. BacTrace E. coli O103:H8 and a polyclonal antibody against E. coli O103 were obtained from KPL (Gaithersburg, MD). Printed circuits
on 4 in. silica wafers were produced and measured as previously described.30−34 Water was purified in a Neu-Ion system (Baltimore, MD), or high-performance
liquid chromatography water was obtained from Fisher Scientific.

Instrument
The CNTs were separated in a new mixer–settler
spiral disk CCC rotor (17.5 cm OD, cat. no. 205-20001, CC Biotech,
Rockville, MD) operated in a planetary centrifuge (CentriChrom, Inc.
Buffalo, NY).27 The rotor shown in Figure 1 is built with six
plastic spiral disks made of SOMOS NeXT by stereolithography. The
4 mm thick disks are sandwiched between Viton gaskets or sheets. The
disks have four interweaved 2.6 mm wide × 2.0 mm deep channels
with segments divided by 1.6 mm wide “pins” that allow
flow on either side. In every fourth segment is a
glass bead for “mixing”, and the remaining spaces are
for “settling”, which allows the phases to flow on either
side of the pins helping to retain the stationary phase. The gaskets
hold the liquid flow in the spiral channels. The flow passes into
the rotor and through to the next disk via a hole in the gasket near
the center. The liquid volume held in the rotor is 84 mL.

Solvent System
The ATPS system consists of PEG MW 8000
and DEX MW 75 000 containing SDC. The gradient of SDS from
0 to 0.7% in the upper PEG-rich phase as the mobile phase served to
elute the CNTs during chromatography. The solvent system was made
by combining 300 mL of 10% PEG/water by weight and 200 mL of 16% DEX
and 1 mL of 10% SDC, all of which formed two phases, SS#1. To the
same solvent system, 3.5 g SDS was added to make SS#2, which was used
for the gradient. The solvent composition and gradient method described
previously4 were used.

Sample Preparation
The method for sample preparation
of powdered CNTs was to sonicate with a Branson Sonifier 450 UltraSonic
Processor Homogenizer Disruptor with 3–5 2 s pulses, followed
by incubation in a sonicating water bath for 5 min. A suspension of
10 mg in 0.5 mL 10% SC and 0.5 mL 10% SDC is thus solubilized, and
0.25 mL is removed and added to 3 mL UP SS#1 and 3 mL LP SS# 1, vortexed,
and allowed to settle into two phases. The upper phase is removed,
and 1 mL of fresh UP SS#1 is added, which is dispersed by water bath
sonication and allowed to settle; the total volume is then loaded
into the CCC. This was the procedure for the 2.5 mg sample load.

Elution Conditions
The rotor is filled with lower-phase
SS#1; the sample is then pumped into the rotor at 0.5 mL/min. When
it is in the rotor, the centrifugation is started at 990–1000
rpm, and the mobile-phase SS#1 is eluted at a rate of 0.5 mL/min.
At this point, the gradient is started, that is, elution from UP SS#1
(A) to 100% UP SS#2 (B) over a 9 h period. Fractions of 8 mL are collected
using an automated fraction collector. The elution mode is the upper-phase
flow entering the bottom of the rotor and eluting out of the top with
rotation being CCW in the head-to-tail direction (U-o-H).27

Analysis of Fractions
Generally,
a 0.5 mL aliquot is
taken out of the vortexed fraction to include both phases, and 0.5
mL 2% aq. SDS is added to dissolve all of the phases and is then sonicated
to make a clear solution. Absorbance is read with water as the blank
in a Cary 3E VC-Vis Spectrophotometer (Varian, division of Agilent,
Santa Clara, CA). The absorbance of the fractions were plotted. Spectra
of these fractions were measured from 200 to 900 nm to analyze the
peaks, which help identify chiral SWCNT species.

Semiconductor
Activity
The fractions containing color
were assessed for semiconductor activity in the model polybrene impedance
assay. Briefly, for measuring the sample FET impedance, the SWCNT-coated
circuits were incubated with 2 μL of Di H2O for 20–30
s to obtain baseline values for each circuit. After baseline accrual,
2 μL of polybrene (50 μg/mL in Di H2O, final
concentration) was added. Further description of this assay procedure
is in the Results and Discussion section.
