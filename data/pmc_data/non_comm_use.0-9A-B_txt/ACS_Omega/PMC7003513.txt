The ability to switch on the activity of an enzyme through its spontaneous
reconstitution
has proven to be a valuable tool in fundamental studies of enzyme
structure/reactivity relationships or in the design of artificial
signal transduction systems in bioelectronics, synthetic biology,
or bioanalytical applications. In particular, those based on the spontaneous
reconstitution/activation of the apo-PQQ-dependent soluble glucose
dehydrogenase (sGDH) from Acinetobacter calcoaceticus were widely developed. However, the reconstitution mechanism of
sGDH with its two cofactors, i.e., pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ)
and Ca2+, remains unknown. The objective here is to elucidate
this mechanism by stopped-flow kinetics under single-turnover conditions.
The reconstitution of sGDH exhibited biphasic kinetics, characteristic
of a square reaction scheme associated with two activation pathways.
From a complete kinetic analysis, we were able to fully predict the
reconstitution dynamics and also to demonstrate that when PQQ first
binds to apo-sGDH, it strongly impedes the access of Ca2+ to its enclosed position at the bottom of the enzyme binding site,
thereby greatly slowing down the reconstitution rate of sGDH. This
slow calcium insertion may purposely be accelerated by providing more
flexibility to the Ca2+ binding loop through the specific
mutation of the calcium-coordinating P248 proline residue, reducing
thus the kinetic barrier to calcium ion insertion. The dynamic nature
of the reconstitution process is also supported by the observation
of a clear loop shift and a reorganization of the hydrogen-bonding
network and van der Waals interactions observed in both active sites
of the apo and holo forms, a structural change modulation that was
revealed from the refined X-ray structure of apo-sGDH (PDB: 5MIN).

Introduction
Many enzymes require
the noncovalent insertion of cofactors (e.g.,
flavins, hemes, metal ions, iron–sulfur clusters) into their
apoprotein binding site to be fully active. In numerous cases, this
enzyme activation process, also termed enzyme reconstitution, can
be achieved in vitro through a precise control of the reaction conditions
(temperature, buffer composition, pH, etc.), paving thus the way for
fundamental investigations of enzyme structure/reactivity relationships
(notably by taking advantage of engineered binding partners such as
apoenzyme mutants and/or cofactor analogues)1−8 or even for discovering new enzyme functionalities.9−11 Besides to the capacity of switching on the activity of an enzyme
by simply adding its cofactor, enzyme reconstitution has also been
advantageously exploited in different biotechnological applications,5,10,12−19 ranging from the design of artificial signal transduction systems
for analytical purposes to the development of new applications in
biotechnology, bioelectronics, or synthetic biology.10,20−25

Among the enzymes whose catalytic activity can be easily and
efficiently
switched on via reconstitution, the soluble quinoprotein glucose dehydrogenase
(sGDH, code UniprotKB F0KFV3) is certainly the most prevailing and attractive.15,26−33 The reason for such interest is that, in the presence of calcium
ions, the catalytic property of sGDH for aldoses oxidation can be
rapidly and spontaneously activated through the specific and tight
binding of its PQQ cofactor to the apoprotein (apo-sGDH). This property
has led to the design of novel analytical methods for the sensitive
detection of calcium ions30 or PQQ29 and to the conception of unique signal amplification
strategies to boost the analytical performances of miscellaneous affinity
binding assays.15,31,32 Other features that make sGDH an attractive activatable enzyme is
the ease with which the apoenzyme can be overproduced in a recombinant
strain of Escherichia coli and isolated
with a high yield and purity (totally free of PQQ).34,35 The reconstitution reaction is furthermore spontaneous and fast
in the presence of Ca2+, mainly driven by the high-affinity
binding of PQQ to the apo-sGDH (equilibrium dissociation constant
in the sub-nanomolar range).29 Also, the
holoenzyme exhibits a remarkably high catalytic activity toward the
oxidation of glucose with concomitant reduction of a wide range of
natural or artificial electron acceptors, a catalytic reactivity that
can be easily monitored either spectrophotometrically or electrochemically.
Albeit there are several works reporting on sGDH reconstitution34,36−38 as well as on its exploitation in different biotechnological
applications,15,29−32 its reconstitution mechanism
remains unknown. Previous studies have yet established that, similarly
to alcohol dehydrogenase, reconstitution of the homodimeric sGDH enzyme
requires the binding of six calcium ions and two PQQ molecules.39−41 Four of the Ca2+ ions are involved in the functional
dimerization of the two protein subunits (i.e., held together by four
Ca2+ ions shared at the interfaces) and two for the activation
of each PQQ cofactor present in each of two apoenzyme subunits (i.e.,
one Ca2+ ion per PQQ in close interaction within the binding
site).36 Other divalent cations (Cd2+, Mn2+, Sr2+) were also revealed to
be effective in the dimerization and activation of the apoenzyme.37 In addition, the binding of PQQ was shown to
be remarkably efficient, not only thermodynamically but also kinetically.
Dissociation constants in the nano- to picomolar range were reported
in the presence of millimolar Ca2+, demonstrating the high-affinity
binding of PQQ to the apo-sGDH,29,37 while a second-order
rate constant of (∼1–2) × 106 M–1 s–1 characterizing the binding
of PQQ to the apo-sGDH was determined for the enzyme either reconstituted
in a homogenous solution42 or once immobilized
on an electrode surface.29 These kinetics
were, however, examined in the presence of a large excess of Ca2+ and under steady-state kinetics, preventing thus a detailed
understanding of the role played by this second cofactor in the reconstitution
mechanism.

The aim of this paper is thus to fill this gap by
investigating
the reconstitution mechanism of apo-sGDH with PQQ and Ca2+ by stopped-flow kinetics. From analysis of the transient kinetics
under single-turnover conditions, we show that the reconstitution
follows two different pathways, each depending on the order the cofactors
are positioned in the binding site, i.e., PQQ binding followed by
Ca2+ or Ca2+ binding followed by PQQ. It finally
allows us to propose a comprehensive overview of the reconstitution
mechanism of sGDH, from which we were then able to quantitatively
rationalize and predict the reconstitution dynamics. Moreover, from
the determination of the complete X-ray structure of apo-sGDH and
comparison to the holo-sGDH, we were able to evidence a movement of
the loop located near the binding pocket, highlighting thus the dynamic
nature of the reconstitution process.

Results
As previously
reported by Duine and colleagues,34,36 the isolated
apo-sGDH from E. coli recombinant strain
is in the dimeric form, containing thus Ca2+ at the interface
between the two subunits but no PQQ. The
preparation also remains dimeric after desalting over gel filtration
or upon high dilution in a Ca2+-free buffer. Even in the
presence of an excess of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), the
protein remains as a dimer, demonstrating that Ca2+ once
bounded at the subunit interface is locked.

The kinetics of
sGDH reconstitution was investigated by stopped-flow
experiments. The methodology consists of rapidly mixing PQQ, apo-sGDH,
Ca2+, and excess glucose and then following by UV–visible
spectroscopy the transient reduction of PQQ once the latter is properly
bounded and activated into the apoenzyme binding site. In this way,
single-turnover reduction of PQQ witnesses the active behavior of
the reconstituted enzyme since free PQQ cannot be directly chemically
reduced by glucose in solution. The reduction rate of the PQQ cofactor
in the enzyme was monitored at λ = 338 nm, a wavelength that
relates to a maximal absorbance change between the oxidized (i.e.,
holoox) and reduced state of sGDH (i.e., holored wherein the PQQ cofactor is doubly reduced in its pyrroloquinoline
quinol form or PQQH2) (Figure S1 in the Supporting Information). For the kinetic information of the
enzymatic reconstitution process to be properly extracted, it was
indispensable to select experimental conditions that lead to an almost
instantaneous reduction of the bounded (and activated) PQQ cofactor
relative to the rate of its upstream equilibrium binding to the apoenzyme
binding site (in other words, to select conditions where the reduction
of the holoox by glucose is not rate-limiting). To evaluate
how fast is the reduction rate of the wild-type holoox by
an excess glucose, we mixed 2.5 μM subunits of native sGDH with
100 μM glucose in a stopped-flow apparatus and monitored the
transient kinetics by UV–visible spectroscopy at 338 nm (Figure S2). The fast absorbance change that occurs
at 338 nm over a maximal variation of ΔAmax ∼ 0.05 (corresponding to a full reduction of sGDH)
and within a time scale shorter than 30 ms allows setting the time
window required for complete enzyme reduction by glucose (it is worth
to note that because of the fast rate of sGDH reduction a large fraction
of the absorbance change was completed during the dead time of the
instrument). From the known maximal absorbance change at 338 nm and
the fit of an exponential law to the experimental data, an apparent
first-order rate constant of 130 ± 2 s–1 was
found. This value agrees well with that previously determined for
the reductive half-reaction of sGDH39,42 under similar
conditions, confirming that the catalyzed hydride transfer reaction
from glucose to the PQQ cofactor in the active site is a fast process.
These experimental conditions (i.e., 2.5 μM subunits of sGDH
and 100 μM glucose), finally leading to a fast reduction of
holoox by glucose, were then selected for the further kinetic
experiments.

To investigate the kinetics of sGDH reconstitution
under single-turnover
conditions, we tested PQQ concentrations ranging from substoichiometric
to overstoichiometric ratios (i.e., from 0.5 to 40 μM) relative
to the total amount of available apo-sGDH binding sites (2.5 μM
subunits) in the presence of fixed concentrations of CaCl2 (3 mM) and glucose (100 μM). The data reported in Figure 1A exhibit biphasic
exponential kinetics within a time frame extending from 20 ms to 100
s, much slower than the time scale required for the above reduction
of the holoenzyme by glucose (half-life t1/2 ∼ 5 ms, Figure S2). This therefore
means that under the selected conditions, the reaction is essentially
rate-controlled by the equilibrium binding of PQQ to the apoenzyme
and not by the following step of holoenzyme reduction by glucose.
This result also shows that the proposed transient UV–visible
kinetic methodology is relevant for characterizing the reconstitution
mechanism of sGDH.

(A) Kinetic traces (average of four consecutive experiments) obtained

3 mM CaCl2, and different concentrations of PQQ (from left
to right): 40, 25, 15, 10, 5, 2.5, 2, 1.5, 1, and 0.5 μM (the
code color for each [PQQ] is reported on the graph). All concentrations
given are after mixing. The reactions were monitored at 338 nm and
10 °C in a 50 mM Tris buffer (pH 7.5). (B) Titration plot of
apo-GDH by PQQ obtained from the plot of total absorbance change in
(A) as a function of the [PQQ]/[apo-sGDH] ratio. (C) Kinetic traces
(average of four consecutive experiments) obtained after mixing 2.5 μM
subunits of apo-sGDH with 5 μM PQQ (2-fold excess), 100 μM
glucose, and different concentrations of CaCl2: 9 μM,
100 μM, 3 mM, 30 mM, 60 mM, and 150 mM (the code color for each
[CaCl2] is reported on the graph). All concentrations given
are after mixing, and other experimental conditions are the same as
in (A). The black dotted curves in (A) and (C) are the best fits of
a biexponential law to the experimental data.

The maximal amplitude of the absorbance change at 338 nm (ΔAmax) in Figure 1A is linked to the fraction of apo-sGDH that reconstitutes
and activates. By reporting this maximal amplitude as a function of
the [PQQ]/[apo-sGDH] ratio, we can obtain the titration plot of apo-sGDH
by PQQ (Figure 1B).
The plot shows that apo-GDH can be fully reconstituted (and so fully
activated) at a 1.1:1 ratio of PQQ/apoenzyme subunits, which is, within
the experimental error, close to that expected for the binding of
one PQQ molecule per subunit. Consequently, the two well-distinct
kinetic phases observed in Figure 1A suggest the existence of two different enzyme activation
pathways, occurring in parallel but at different paces.

The
kinetics of sGDH reconstitution was also examined for different
concentrations of calcium (ranging from 9 μM to 150 mM), keeping
constant the ratio of PQQ/apo-sGDH subunits to an excess of 2 (Figure 1C). The gradual transition
from a biphasic kinetics at low calcium concentrations (for which
the slow kinetic pathway predominates) to a simple first-order kinetics
at high Ca2+ concentration provides evidence that calcium
plays a key role in the partitioning of reactants between the two
parallel pathways. In addition, the almost identical values of the
maximal absorbance change recorded at the end of kinetics (ΔAmax ∼ 0.05) are in good agreement with
the expected burst amplitude for a quantitative activation of the
2.5 μM subunits of apo-sGDH present in solution.

Given
that both PQQ and Ca2+ are required for enzyme
activation, the reconstitution mechanism can thus be reasonably described
by a square reaction scheme with two parallel pathways in competition,
each depending on the binding order of the two entities to form an
activated ternary complex (i.e., holoox), which then rapidly
reduces to holored in the presence of glucose (Scheme 1). From the amplitude
of the absorbance change of one phase (ΔA1 or ΔA2) relative to the
total absorbance change (ΔAmax =
ΔA1 + ΔA2), these experiments give an access to the relative population
of the different transient species contributing to each reaction path.
The amplitudes ΔA1 and ΔA2 as well as the observed rates k1,obs and k2,obs associated
with each kinetic phase were recovered from the nonlinear regression
fit of a biexponential function to the kinetic traces as shown in Figure 1A,C (see Tables S1 and S2 for the extracted data). Under
the reaction conditions of 3 mM Ca2+ (Figure 1A), the ratio ΔA1/ΔAmax is
almost the same regardless of PQQ concentration and close to an average
value of 0.6 (Table S1), a result that
thus provides evidence for a roughly constant balanced initial distribution
of sGDH between two populations that can each independently reconstitute
according to a fast or a slow pathway. This partitioning between fast
and slow reconstitutions is also strongly dependent on [Ca2+], as attested by the plot of ΔA1 or ΔA2 as a function of calcium
concentration in Figure S3 (the graph was
obtained from the values reported in Table S2 as well as from those collected from other experiments), showing
an hyperbolic dependence of the relative amplitude of each phase on
[Ca2+]. This behavior provides evidence for a fast equilibrated
binding reaction between apo-sGDH and Ca2+ (leading to
the formation of apo-sGDH/Ca2+), fast enough to be always
assumed at equilibrium before PQQ significantly binds to the protein.
From the fit of a standard binding isotherm to the data (Figure S3), an apparent equilibrium dissociation
constant of Kdapo-sGDH/Ca = 2.0 ± 0.50 mM was
recovered.

The values k1,obs and k2,obs gathered in Tables S1 and S2 are plotted in Figure 2 as a function of PQQ concentration. In conditions of pseudo-first-order
(ratio [PQQ]/apo-sGDH ≥ 2), the observed rate k1,obs shows a linear dependency on [PQQ], suggesting that
the fast phase of enzyme reconstitution is rate-limited by the entrance
of PQQ. In contrast, k2,obs is found independent
of [PQQ] (an average value of 0.2 s–1) over the
whole explored range (0.5–40 μM), demonstrating that
PQQ is not the rate-limiting factor in this slow enzyme reconstitution
pathway. Interestingly, the observed rates were also found independent
of the order the three partners were mixed inside the two-syringe
stopped-flow device (Table S4), showing
similar values of k1,obs and k2,obs whether the content of the syringe loaded with apo-sGDH
or PQQ was preincubated or not with Ca2+. This observation
reinforces the hypothesis that a fast equilibrium binding occurs between
apo-sGDH and Ca2+, fast enough to be nearly always at equilibrium
during the whole enzyme kinetic experiments.

Figure 2 Plots of (red dots) k1,obs and (green
squares) k2,obs (both recovered from the
fits of a biexponential function to experimental kinetic curves shown
in Figure 1A and whose
data are compiled in Table S1) as a function
of the PQQ concentration or [PQQ]/[apo-sGDH] ratio. The straight line
is the linear regression fit to the k1,obs data determined under pseudo-first-order conditions in the apoenzyme
(i.e., [PQQ] ≥ 5 μM). The slope of the linear regression
fit allows the calculation of the bimolecular rate constant of the
reaction between PQQ and apo-sGDH, leading to a value of k1,PQQ = (1.08 ± 0.05) × 106 M–1 s–1.

The linear relationship between k1,obs and [PQQ] at high PQQ/apo-sGDH ratios (i.e., conditions of pseudo-first-order
in the apoenzyme) gives an access to the second-order rate constant
associated with the binding of PQQ to apo-sGDH under 3 mM Ca2+. From the linear regression fit in Figure 2 (red line), a k1,PQQ value of (1.08 ± 0.05) × 106 M–1 s–1 is obtained. This value was confirmed from
the analysis of a larger set of kinetic experiments performed under
pseudo-first-order conditions (see Figure S4), leading to k1,PQQ = (1.12 ± 0.01)
× 106 M–1 s–1.

It was previously shown by Duine and colleagues37 that the addition of PQQ to apo-sGDH could be monitored
from the quenching of fluorescence engendered by the six tryptophan
residues present in the protein. We therefore took advantage of this
quenching of fluorescence to study the kinetics of sGDH reconstitution. Figure S5 shows that the maximum of fluorescence
emitted by apo-sGDH at 340 nm (red curve) is strongly quenched after
the addition of PQQ together with Ca2+ ions (blue curve).
Stopped-flow experiments were thus performed at 340 nm by monitoring
the quenching rate of the apo-sGDH fluorescence as a function of [PQQ]
and [Ca2+] (only overstoichiometric ratios of [PQQ]/[apo-sGDH]
were considered because of a too weak and noisy fluorescence under
substoichiometric conditions) (Figure 3). In contrast to the above kinetic traces determined
from the absorbance change at 338 nm, the time-course plots of quenching
of fluorescence in Figure 3A,B are all well-characterized by a single kinetic phase,
whatever the concentration of PQQ and Ca2+. From the fit
of a monoexponential decay to the highest PQQ concentrations, the
recovered observed rate not only linearly depends on the PQQ concentration
(Figure S4, red triangles) but also coincides
with the values of k1,obs previously determined
from the absorbance change (it is to note that the significant change
observed for both the fluorescence offset and the overall fluorescence
amplitude as a function of PQQ concentration is presumed to be associated
with a fast nonspecific quenching of fluorescence generated by excess
PQQ in solution). This result strongly supports that the quenching
of fluorescence of apo-sGDH in the absence of glucose addresses the
same fast kinetic process than the one associated with the fast phase
of the absorbance change at 338 nm in the presence of glucose, a fast
process we have attributed to the entrance of PQQ in the apo-sGDH
binding site. From the slope of the linear regression fit to the data
in Figure S4, a second-order rate constant
of (1.25 ± 0.03) × 106 M–1 s–1 was obtained, which is thus close to the one obtained
from the absorbance change at 338 nm (i.e., (1.12 ± 0.01) ×
106 M–1 s–1).

All concentrations given are after mixing. The reactions were carried
out at 10 °C in a 50 mM Tris buffer (pH 7.5), and the fluorescence
was monitored at 340 nm with an excitation at 297 nm. (B) Stopped-flow
kinetics obtained after mixing 2.5 μM subunits of apo-sGDH with
5 μM PQQ and different concentrations of CaCl2 (from

150 mM. All concentrations given are after mixing, and other experimental
conditions are the same as in (A). The black dotted curves in (A)
and (B) are the best fits of a monoexponential function to the experimental
data.

Concerning the effect of [Ca2+] on the time course of
fluorescence quenching (performed here at a fixed [PQQ]/[apo-sGDH]
ratio of 2), the kinetic plots in Figure 3B show that kobs remains relatively constant and independent of [Ca2+]
(kobs ∼ 4–5 s–1) until the latter remains lower than 3 mM, while it progressively
decreases for Ca2+ concentrations >3 mM (Table S3). This outcome correlates very well
with the fast
kinetic phase of the absorbance change at 338 nm, wherein k1,obs is similarly slowed down at [Ca2+] > 3 mM (the kinetic traces performed at 30, 60, and 150 mM Ca2+ in Figure 3B matched quite well those reported in Figure 1C at the same Ca2+ concentrations).
As will be discussed later on, we have attributed this behavior to
an inhibition of the fast enzyme reconstitution pathway by excess
Ca2+. Additionally, the fact that the kinetics of fluorescence
quenching follows a single exponential decay independent of [Ca2+] for concentrations lower than 3 mM provides evidence that
the surveyed process under these conditions is the conformational
changes induced by the binding of PQQ to the apoenzyme site (and this,
whether or not there is a Ca2+ ion present in the binding
site). Such a behavior clearly differs from the dependence of k1,obs on [Ca2+] observed in Figure 1C and Table S2, which likewise addresses the binding
of PQQ to the apo-sGDH but differently since in this case this is
the fraction of apo-sGDH (i.e., apo-sGDH/Ca2+) that is
involved in the fast activation pathway (a fraction that itself depends
on the calcium concentration through the fast equilibrated reaction
between apo-sGDH and Ca2+, leading thus to a dependence
of k1,obs on [Ca2+] at low
Ca2+ concentrations).

Duine and his collaborators
have demonstrated that, in the absence
of calcium ions, apo-GDH can reconstitute into a much less active
form of sGDH, baptized holoXox, a Ca2+-free
enzyme able to slowly convert into its reduced holoXred counterpart in the presence of glucose.34,36 To characterize the kinetics of these two processes (i.e., the rate
of holoXox formation as well as the rate of the slow holoXox reduction by glucose in the absence of calcium), we performed
stopped-flow kinetics experiments without calcium and in the presence
of a large excess of EDTA (to scavenge any residual traces of free
Ca2+ in solution) (Figure S6). The conversion rate of apo-sGDH into holoXox was extracted
from the quenching of fluorescence of tryptophan at 340 nm as a function
of different concentrations of PQQ. The resulting kinetic traces in Figure S6 are characterized by an exponential
decay of fluorescence, similar to that previously observed in the
presence of calcium. The observed rate extracted from each plot varies
linearly with excess PQQ (Figure S6), thus
allowing to recover a second-order rate constant of k2,PQQ = 0.94 × 106 M–1 s–1. This value is very close to the rate k1,PQQ determined in the presence of calcium,
leading us to conclude that the binding rate of PQQ to the apoenzyme
is almost unchanged whether there is or not a calcium ion anchored
within the binding site of apo-sGDH.

To further characterize
the reduction rate of holoXox into holoXred subsequent
to the addition of glucose,
we monitored the reaction by UV–visible spectrophotometry at
307 nm (see Figure S7 for the selection
of this wavelength) in a stopped-flow apparatus. The kinetic trace
reported in Figure S8 demonstrates a very
slow reduction rate of holoXox by glucose, leading to a
pseudo-first-order rate of kred,X = 8.4
× 10–4 s–1, a value that
is more than 160 000 times slower than in the presence of calcium
(kred = 130 s–1, Figure S2). This result confirms the strong effect
of Ca2+ on the sGDH reactivity, the role of which is to
activate the PQQ cofactor (activation at the C5 position
of PQQ) and to promote the hydride transfer reaction between glucose
and PQQ.43

The possibility to isolate
the holoXred form of sGDH
has pushed us to determine the incorporation rate of Ca2+ into holoXred to form the holored, a binding
reaction wherein the reduced PQQ cofactor already present in the enzyme
pocket is assumed to hinder the access of calcium, the latter position
of which is located just behind the PQQ binding site at the bottom
of the active site.40 For such a purpose,
we have monitored by stopped flow the transition from holoXred to holored by simply mixing different concentrations
of Ca2+ to a holoXred solution, followed by
the absorbance measurement at 338 nm. The reaction rate was observed
to hyperbolically depend on the concentration of Ca2+ (Figure S9), suggesting a two-step binding reaction
mechanism that we have assumed to obey Michaelis–Menten-type
kinetics. From the best curve fitting, the following maximal rate
(k3,Ca′) and apparent Michaelis–Menten constant (K3,CaM) were recovered: k3,Ca′ = 0.52 ± 0.01 s–1 and K3,CaM = 5.30 ± 0.69 mM.

On account of
the very slow reduction of holoXox into
holoXred and the fast and almost irreversible conversion
of apo-sGDH into holoXox (the strong equilibrium binding
constant is assumed to lead to a slow dissociation rate of PQQ from
holoXox, vide infra), it is possible to characterize the
binding reaction of Ca2+ to holoXox (in a similar
way as above with holoXred), generating thus the transient
species holoox, which then rapidly converts into holored in the presence of glucose. For the rate of this reaction
to be assessed, different concentrations of calcium in the presence
of an excess of glucose were then mixed with holoXox in
a stopped-flow apparatus and the reaction mixture was then kinetically
monitored by UV–vis at 338 nm (Figure S10). The resulting kinetic plots were fitted to a monoexponential function,
leading to an observed rate that hyperbolically depends on the concentration
of Ca2+ (Figure S10). Again,
this behavior suggests a two-step binding reaction mechanism that
we have once more assumed to obey a Michaelis–Menten-type reaction.
From the best curve fitting, the following parameters were obtained: k2,Ca′ = 1.19 ± 0.2 s–1 and K2,CaM = 0.6 ±
0.3 mM. The value of k2,Ca′ (that can formally be assimilated
to k2,obs) is here somewhat higher when
compared with k2,obs determined in Figure 2. We attributed this
discrepancy to the high scattering we encountered in the experimental
determination of k2,Ca′ and K2,CaM (Figure S10), probably resulting from the presence
of a large excess of EDTA. In addition, one may note that the value
of K2,CaM is an order of magnitude lower than K3,CaM, revealing
the strongest interaction of calcium with the oxidized form of PQQ
as compared to the reduced one.

To provide further evidence
that the slow activation pathways in
the sGDH reconstitution mechanism are linked to the difficulty for
calcium to reach its enclosed position when PQQ is already present
in the enzyme binding site (steric effect), we have mutated the P248
amino acid into alanine. The mutation of this proline was chosen because
it is located within a loop near the active site that is expected
to significantly contribute to the three-dimensional organization
of the enzyme active site (the distinctive cyclic structure of the
side chain of proline is well-known to provide a conformational rigidity
compared to other amino acids, affecting thus the secondary structure
of proteins near a proline residue44).
An additional reason is that the two carbonyl groups present on the
amino acids P248 and G247 are known to directly interact with the
calcium ion, which itself strongly interacts with PQQ (Figure 4D). The P248A mutation is thus
anticipated to significantly increase the flexibility and mobility
of the loop coordinating the calcium ion and therefore to potentially
reduce the kinetic cost of the calcium insertion when PQQ binds first.
The reconstitution of the mutated P248A apo-sGDH was then characterized
by stopped-flow kinetic experiments under the same conditions as for
the wild-type apoenzyme (Table S4). Similar
to that of the wild-type enzyme, biphasic kinetic traces were obtained,
leading for the fast phase to an observed rate constant of k1,obs = 12 ± 2 s–1 (Table S4), which is within a range of a factor
2, comparable to that obtained with the wild-type apo-sGDH (i.e., k1,obs = 5.4 ± 0.9 s–1). This result demonstrates a negligible effect of the mutation on
the binding rate of PQQ. In contrast, the rate of the slow phase is
observed to be significantly enhanced for the mutant enzyme (k2,obs = 3.7 ± 0.8 s–1, which is ∼16-fold higher than for the wild-type, i.e., k2,obs = 0.23 ± 0.02 s–1) (Table S4), suggesting that the P248A
mutation has a substantial structural effect on the accessibility
of Ca2+ to its enclosed position within the holoX active
site. As anticipated, the mutation leads to an increased flexibility
of the loop coordinating Ca2+, which thereby facilitates
the incorporation and/or access of the calcium ion within the sterically
congested site of holoX.

atom in each structure and, in the case of the apo form, the water
molecule network filling the cavity in the absence of PQQ.

Finally, with the aim to fully characterize the environment
of
the binding pocket before reconstitution, we have determined the X-ray
structure of apo-sGDH in the presence of calcium at 1.76 Å of
resolution (PDB 5MIN). In the previously published X-ray structure of apo-sGDH, two loops
from positions 105 to 110 and 333 to 346 and a disulfide bridge (CYS345–CYS338)
were lacking (PDB 1QBI),41 while in our new X-ray structure
of apo-sGDH, the disulfide bridge is intact and the two loops are
clearly defined (see Figure 4A,B for the loop from positions 334 to 346 including the disulfide
bridge and Figure S11 to see the electron
density of the loop from positions 333 to 346). Interestingly, the
superimposition of the apo and holo Cα traces shows a shift
of 1 to 2 Å in the relative position of the loop located from
333 to 346 (Figure 4B). This clearly suggests that a local conformational rearrangement
occurs during and/or following the binding of PQQ, which might act
as a lock to ensure the strong affinity of PQQ (a dissociation constant
of 30 pM and a dissociation rate as low as k–1,PQQ = 3.4 × 10–5 s–1, vide infra). This might then result in a kinetic barrier (or a
steric constraint) to overcome for the insertion of Ca2+ when PQQ is already in place in the apo-sGDH binding site.

Discussion
On the basis of the overall results obtained above, we can finally
propose a more elaborate version of the minimum square reaction mechanism
described in Scheme 1 by the mechanism depicted in Scheme 2. The latter involves a preferred-order binding of
the two cofactors rather than a completely random mechanism (a preferred-order
binding that strongly depends on the calcium concentration) to form,
on the one side (a fast pathway), a ternary holoox complex
that rapidly converts into its reduced holored form in
the presence of glucose and, on the other side (a slow pathway), a
binary holoXox complex that can either (i) be slowly converted
in the presence of Ca2+ into a ternary one according to
a two-step reaction (assumed here to be analogous to a Michaelis–Menten-type
process, wherein Ca2+ reacts first through a fast equilibrium
binding followed by a slow first-order reaction to lock Ca2+ in its sterically congested site in the enzyme), followed by fast
reduction with glucose, or (ii) be directly very slowly reduced by
glucose into holoXred before being definitely converted
into holored through a two-step reaction with Ca2+ (that we have again considered as a Michaelis–Menten type
process in agreement with the hyperbolic rate dependence on [Ca2+]). In addition, to take into account the reversible apparent
inhibition observed at high Ca2+ concentrations (>3
mM)
(i.e., the decrease of k1,obs at high
[Ca2+]; see Table S3), an additional
equilibrium reaction was added (the inhibition path) by considering
the fast reversible formation of a PQQ/Ca2+ complex, which
thus consequently decreases the amount of free PQQ in solution and
slow-downs (or inhibits) the enzymatic reconstitution at very high
[Ca2+]. Although there is no information about the real
nature of this inhibition process, we have postulated that it may
arise from an equilibrium binding interaction between PQQ and Ca2+ (with kinetic rate constants ki and k–i), leading thus to a PQQ/Ca2+ complex ineffective
in reconstituting apo-sGDH into a holo active form. The interaction
between PQQ and Ca2+ is supported by previous works where
it has been shown that a PQQ/Ca2+ complex can be generated
at high Ca2+ concentration in either an organic solvent45 or an aqueous buffer.46

Scheme 2 Global Mechanism for the Reconstitution/Activation of apo-sGDH into
Active PQQ-sGDH
A full kinetic description
of the global reconstitution mechanism
in Scheme 2 implies
the definition of 14 rate constants, which have to be as far as possible
independently determined. Let us first focus on the fast pathway.
Five rate constants are required for this pathway: two for the reversible
binding of Ca2+ to apo-sGDH (i.e., k1,Ca and k–1,Ca for the
association and dissociation rate constants of Ca2+, respectively),
two for the binding of PQQ to the apo-sGDH/Ca2+ complex
(i.e., k1,PQQ and k–1,PQQ for the association and dissociation rate constants
of PQQ, respectively), and one for the reduction of holoox to holored at a saturated concentration of glucose (i.e., kred = 130 s–1). As discussed
earlier, the binding of Ca2+ is considered very fast since
preincubation of calcium with either PQQ or apo-sGDH does not influence
or change the experimental kinetic traces. Considering the relative
small hydrodynamic size of the calcium ion and the broad accessibility
of the apo-sGDH binding pocket (the binding site of PQQ is located
at the top of the barrel in a deep, broad, and positively charged
cleft40), we can legitimately assume that
the second-order binding rate of Ca2+ to apo-sGDH is diffusion-controlled,
which therefore means a rate constant k1,Ca in the range of 108–109 M–1 s–1.47 The kinetics
of the reverse reaction can be set from the knowledge of the equilibrium
dissociation constant. The latter can be estimated from the change
in the absorbance of the fast pathway relative to that of the slow
pathway as a function of [Ca2+] (Figure S3), a ratio that sets the fast equilibrium between the two
pathways (slow and fast). From the analysis of this ratio, an equilibrium
constant in the millimolar range was found (i.e., Kdapo-sGDH/Ca = 5.3 mM). It follows that k–1,Ca is in the range of 105–106 s–1. This agrees with the fact Ca2+ is coordinated only by
the two carbonyl oxygens of P248 and G247. The fast binding of PQQ
to apo-sGDH/Ca2+ was determined from analysis of the observed
rate of the fast kinetic phase as a function of [PQQ]. A bimolecular
rate constant of k1,PQQ = 1.1 × 106 M–1 s–1 was obtained
from the linear regression fit of k1,obs as a function of [PQQ] (Figure 2), which is a rather fast rate, not far from that of
a diffusion-controlled reaction. The dissociation rate of PQQ from
holoox was then indirectly recovered from the equilibrium
dissociation constant between PQQ and apo-sGDH/Ca2+ (Kdholoox) that we had previously determined at room temperature
in the presence of 3 mM CaCl2 (i.e., conditions for which
most of the reconstitution goes through the fast pathway).29 On account of the remarkably low value of Kdholoox = (3.0 ± 1.5) × 10–11 M
previously published,29 a rather slow dissociation
rate of k–1,PQQ = 3.4 × 10–5 s–1 can be calculated.

Let
us now consider the slow pathway for which the initial binding
of PQQ to apo-sGDH leads to the formation of holoXox, followed
by the binding of Ca2+ to generate the holoox form. The existence of holoXox was confirmed from the
UV–vis absorption spectra in Figure S7, showing a maximum at 340 nm, which is 12 nm lower than for holoox but 12 nm higher than for free PQQ.36 This was also corroborated by the fast quenching of fluorescence
after rapid mixing of apo-sGDH with PQQ in the absence of Ca2+ (Figure S6), confirming the fast incorporation
of PQQ into the apo-sGDH binding site. Such a behavior is consistent
with previous works, showing that Ca2+ ions in the binding
site are not required for a strong binding of PQQ to the apoenzyme
binding site.43 The calcium ion remains,
however, indispensable for the enzyme activation because in its absence
holoXox can be only very slowly reduced into holoXred with glucose, as attested by our kinetic experiment in Figure S8, leading to a kred,X value of 8 × 10–4 s–1 (which is ∼162 500-fold slower than kred) (see Scheme 2). The slow reconstitution pathway of sGDH is expected to
predominate at low calcium concentrations. For instance, most of the
reconstitution goes through the slow pathway at the lowest Ca2+ concentration that we have tested (i.e., 9 μM). At
such a low calcium concentration, the fluorescence quenching is mainly
due to the binding of PQQ to apo-sGDH. In the absence of calcium,
the monoexponential decay of fluorescence as a function of [PQQ] (Figure S6) allows the extraction of the bimolecular
rate constant, k2,PQQ, characterizing
the binding of PQQ to the Ca2+-free apo-sGDH site. A value
of (0.94 ± 0.20) × 106 M–1 s–1 was obtained, which is very close to the value of k1,PQQ (i.e., 1.1 × 106 M–1 s–1), demonstrating that the binding
rate of PQQ is not significantly affected whether there is or not
a Ca2+ ion present in the enzyme binding site. This, however,
does not inform us of the value of the dissociation rate k–2,PQQ, which is expected to be somewhat a little
higher than k–1,PQQ because there
is no Ca2+ in holoXox to further stabilize the
PQQ cofactor. However, we can reasonably hypothesize that the absence
of Ca2+ should not decrease the affinity binding of PQQ
by a factor greater than 1 or 2 orders of magnitude. Therefore, for
that reason, we have assumed a k–2,PQQ value lower than 10–2 s–1 (meaning
a KdholoXox value > 10–8 M).

The last rate constants that are needed to fully describe the slow
pathway are those associated with the two-step binding of Ca2+ to holoXox, characterizing thus the entrance of Ca2+ into the holoXox enzyme site, followed by its
slow binding at the bottom of the enzyme active site sterically constrained
by the presence of the PQQ cofactor. A rough estimation of the two
parameters (i.e., K2,CaM and k2,Ca′) characterizing this
two-step Michaelis–Menten-type reaction was obtained from the
stopped-flow kinetic experiments reported in Figure S10. The value of k2,Ca′ (1.2 s–1) is
within the range of k2,obs (0.2 s–1) that we had previously determined from kinetic analysis
of the slow enzyme reconstitution pathway in Figure 2. According to Scheme 2, these two rate constants can be assimilated
because of addressing the same rate-limiting step in the mechanism.
It is worth noting that owing to the high scattering in the data of Figure S10, the values of K2,CaM and k2,Ca′ are entailed by a high degree of incertitude that does not guarantee
their high reliability, an issue that may explain the observed divergence
between k2,Ca′ and k2,obs. We have thus finally considered the value of k2,obs inferred from Figure 2 as the more relevant data for characterizing k2,Ca′.

Once a comprehensive overview of the overall kinetic rate
constants
characterizing the global reaction mechanism proposed in Scheme 2 was obtained, it
was interesting to see whether this mechanism, with its associated
rate constants, could be used to numerically simulate and predict
the experimental kinetic plots of Figure 2. For such a purpose, we have used the open-source
software COPASI, which allows solving numerically kinetic models with
varying levels of complexity.48 Using the
overall rate constants reported in black and green in Scheme 2 and Table 1 and adjusting the rate constants in blue,
we were finally able to predict quite well by simulation the UV–visible
experimental kinetic traces given in Figure 2 (see Figure 5 for a side-by-side comparison of simulated curves
to the experimental ones). This good agreement between simulations
and experiments was made possible thanks to the iterative adjustment
of K2,CaM, k2,Ca′, and KdPQQ/Ca to values
of 0.1 mM, 0.25 s–1, and 15 mM, respectively, and
also by taking into consideration the individual absorbance of each
of the different intermediate species generated along the reaction
(this has been achieved using the extinction coefficients gathered
in Table S5 and considering the numerically
simulated time-course concentration profiles of the overall species
adsorbing at 338 nm). The rather excellent agreement between the simulated
kinetic and experimental curves a posteriori strongly supports the
proposed mechanism.

Figure 5 Comparison between (left) experimental and (right) simulated
UV–vis
kinetic traces (monitored at 338 nm). The experimental curves in the
top and bottom are the same as in Figure 1A,C, respectively. The simulated curves were
obtained from the numerical simulation of the global reaction mechanism
shown in Scheme 2 and
using the reported rate constants (some of these constants are those
determined experimentally, while others were iteratively adjusted
in such a way to get the best fit between the simulations and the
experimental plots).

c The absolute rate
constants in green
were estimated by assuming a diffusion-controlled bimolecular reaction.

d The other rate constants (in

were estimated by the assumption that Ca2+ can bind to
the enzyme according to a diffusion-controlled reaction.

Finally, the slow pathway seems
to be the consequence of the presence
of PQQ in the enzyme binding site that then hampers, through a steric
effect, the access of Ca2+ to its enclosed position. This
difficulty to enter the site while PQQ is already bound to the protein
can be better apprehended in Figure 6, wherein Ca2+ lies at the bottom of the
active site, while PQQ is located above. This steric effect is experimentally
supported by the result that we have obtained with the P248A mutant
(Table S4), showing that the rate-limiting
step of the slow enzyme reconstitution pathway (characterized by k2,Ca′) can be significantly enhanced by reducing the rigidity (or increasing
the flexibility) of the enzyme binding site. In addition, comparison
of the X-ray structures of apo- and holo-sGDH evidences the dynamic
nature of the reconstitution process since it suggests that a local
rearrangement of loops 333–346 (close to the binding pocket)
can occur upon PQQ binding and correct positioning of Ca2+ to switch on the activity (Figure 4). It is therefore possible that modulation of the
overall dynamic process through steric constraints would be at the
origin of the observed kinetic differences between the two pathways.

and the network of water molecules in apo-sGDH and illustrating the
difficulty that calcium may have in accessing its binding site when
PQQ binds first to the protein. The surfaces are colored according
to the hydrophobicity of the residues (the more hydrophobic residues
are in red).

Conclusions
We presented here a
detailed description of the reconstitution
mechanism of sGDH from Acinetobacter calcoaceticus. This enzyme provides an ideal playground for the comprehension
of the processes through which an enzyme recovers its full activity.
It is particularly relevant for enzymes that admit two different partners
for a complete activation (here, PQQ and Ca2+). We have
notably shown in this case that the order in which each of the partners
binds to the protein strongly impacts the reconstitution kinetics.
This might help in the design of biotechnological applications in
which the dynamic of such an activity switch is crucial for the response
of the system. In addition, thanks to the detailed knowledge of both
structure and reactivity, we have also demonstrated that this dynamics
may be modulated through the directed mutation of the binding site.

PQQ, glucose, Tris buffer, CaCl2, dichlorophenolindophenol (DCPIP), phenazine methosulfate (PMS),
and other chemicals were purchased from Sigma and used as received.

Expression, Purification, and Reconstitution of Wild-Type and
Mutant sGDHs from A. calcoaceticus
A QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) was used
for the mutations. The presence of mutations was verified by DNA sequencing
at the Functional Genomic Center of Bordeaux. Wild-type apo-sGDH and
P248A apo-sGDH were produced, purified, and then reconstituted with
PQQ and Ca2+, as reported earlier.49 Apo-sGDH and holoox protein concentrations were assessed
spectrophotometrically (Varian Cary 100) from the absorbance at 277
nm (for the extinction coefficients, see Table S5 in the Supporting Information).39 Holored is obtained after the addition of glucose. Enzymes
activities were measured using standard protocols.43 In this article, the concentration of enzymes is, unless
otherwise stated, expressed per monomer (or subunit). After purification
and reconstitution, apo and holo forms of the enzyme were both stored
at −80 °C in a 50 mM Tris buffer (pH 7.5) containing 3
mM CaCl2.

UV–Visible Stopped-Flow Kinetics under
Single Turnover
Pre-steady-state kinetic analysis was carried
out on a MOS 450
stopped-flow apparatus (Biologic), and the data were analyzed using
either the Biokine software package or the Origin software. The dead
time of the stopped-flow apparatus was determined to be 3 ms using
standard protocols.50 All of the experiments
were performed in triplicate with three different batches of enzymes.
For each experiment, on average, at least four runs were performed.

Influence of CaCl2 Preincubated in a Syringe Containing
apo-sGDH or PQQ
To check whether there was any effect of
calcium, we performed three sets of experiments: (i) 10 μM PQQ
in syringe 1 and 5 μM apo-sGDH subunit + 6 mM CaCl2 in syringe 2; (ii) 10 μM PQQ + 6 mM CaCl2 in syringe
1 to 5 μM apo-sGDH subunit in syringe 2; (iii) 10 μM PQQ
+ 3 mM CaCl2 in syringe 1 to 5 μM apo-sGDH + 3 mM
CaCl2 in syringe 2. Control experiments showed that the
enzyme remains dimeric upon dilution.

Kinetic Studies of the
Tryptophan Fluorescence Quenching
Wavelengths of excitation
and emission were determined at the equilibrium
by performing fluorescence quenching with a Xe lamp in the presence
of 5 μM apo-sGDH subunit in the presence or absence of 10 μM
PQQ in a 50 mM Tris buffer (pH 7.5) at 10 °C. The time course
of sGDH fluorescence quenching induced by the binding of PQQ was recorded
on a thermostated MOS 450 Biologic stopped-flow apparatus equipped
with a fluorescence detector and a XeHg lamp (at 800 V). Absorption
and emission wavelengths were set at 297 and 340 nm, respectively.
At such wavelengths, there was no fluorescence contribution from either
the buffer or PQQ. For the kinetic experiments, the first syringe
was filled with 5 μM of apo-sGDH subunits and the second one
with PQQ and CaCl2 at different concentrations ranging
from 5 to 40 μM for PQQ and from 9 μM to 150 mM for CaCl2.

Formation Rate of holored from holoox
The reduction rate of holoox by glucose was monitored
at 338 nm with the stopped-flow apparatus operating in the absorbance
mode (a XeHg lamp at 200 V) thermostated at a controlled temperature
of 10 °C. One syringe was filled with 5 μM of holoox subunit in a 50 mM Tris buffer + 3 mM CaCl2 (pH
7.5) and the other one with 200 μM of glucose in a 50 mM Tris
buffer + 3 mM CaCl2 (pH 7.5). The final concentrations
of sGDH and glucose after mixing were divided by 2.

Formation Rate
of holored from Wild-Type or P248A
apo-sGDH
The rate of PQQ reduction by glucose was measured
at 338 nm with the stopped-flow apparatus operating in the absorbance
mode (a XeHg lamp at 200 V) thermostated at a controlled temperature
of 10 °C. One syringe was filled with 5 μM apo-sGDH subunits
and the other one with a mixture of glucose, PQQ, and CaCl2 at concentrations ranging from 10 to 80 μM for PQQ and from
18 μM to 300 mM for CaCl2; the concentration of glucose
was fixed at 200 μM. The final concentrations of sGDH, PQQ,
glucose, and CaCl2 after mixing were divided by 2.

Structure
Determination and Refinement
Crystallization
Single crystals
of apo-sGDH from A. calcoaceticus were
grown by the vapor diffusion
method. These crystals diffract to beyond 1.76 Å and are suitable
for X-ray crystallography on a home source rotating anode. The space
group was determined to be triclinic P(1). One asymmetric
unit contains a dimer of the apo-sGDH molecule. Preliminary screening
of crystallization conditions was carried out using the Jena Bioscience
Classic Kit (number 2). Crystals suitable for crystallography experiments
were directly obtained by the sitting-drop method (in a 96 well-plate)
with drops consisting of 0.5 μL of the protein solution (at
15 mg mL–1) and 0.5 μL of the reservoir solution
equilibrated against 70 mL of the well solution at 293 K, using a
reservoir solution composed of 30% (w/v) PEG 4000, 200 mM CaCl2, and 100 mM N-(2-hydroxyethyl)piperazine-N′-ethanesulfonic acid (pH 7.5) (condition D2).

Data Collection
X-ray diffraction data of apo-sGDH
were collected at the IECB X-ray facility (CNRS UMS3033, INSERM US001,
University of Bordeaux) at 100 K with a 3 kW Rigaku FR-X X-ray generator
equipped with a Hybrid Dectris Pilatus 200 K detector. XDS and XSCALE51 were used for data integration and scaling.
Statistics of data collection are listed in Table S6.

Structure Determination and Refinement
The crystal
structure of apo-sGDH was determined to have 1.76 Å resolution,
with phases determined by molecular replacement (1C9U as the starting
model) using PHASER.52 Model building was
performed with Coot and illustrated with PyMOL.53 Crystallographic refinement was performed with programs
REFMAC54 and BUSTER-TNT.55 Coordinates were deposited with the PDB accession code 5MIN.

Kinetic Simulations
The open-source software COPASI
4.11 was used for numerical kinetic simulations of the reconstitution
mechanism shown in Scheme 2.
