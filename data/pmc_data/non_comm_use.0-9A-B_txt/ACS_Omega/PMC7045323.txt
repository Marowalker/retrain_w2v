In the last three decades, there
has been a huge increase in the number of antibiotic-resistant bacterial
strains, which is becoming a serious threat to public health. Since
the discovery of new effective antibiotics has dramatically decreased
in last ten years, there are huge initiatives to develop new antimicrobial
approaches to fight drug-resistant bacterial infections. In the last
decade, a new nanoparticle-based tool has emerged to combat deadly
bacterial infections, which may overcome the barriers faced by antibiotic
resistance. The current mini-review highlights recent reports on two-dimensional
(2D) graphene oxide (GO), 2D transition metal dichalcogenides (TMD),
2D MXenes, and 2D heterostructure material-based approaches to tackle
bacteria. Notably, we discuss the major design criteria which have
been used to develop novel antimicrobial 2D and heterostructure materials
to eliminate bacterial infections. Next, details on the various mechanisms
underlying antibacterial activity for 2D and heterostructure materials
such as physical/mechanical damage, lipid extraction, oxidative stress,
and photothermal/photodynamic effects have been discussed. Finally,
we highlight the promises, major challenges, and prospects of nanomaterial-based
approaches to combat multidrug-resistant bacterial infections.

Introduction
The
discovery of penicillin antibiotics by Dr. Alexander Fleming in 19281 revolutionized the medical treatment for infectious
diseases. The success of penicillin encouraged scientists to discover
different types of antibiotics such as cephalosporins, aminoglycosides,
glycopeptides, and quinolones.2−6 It is now well documented that antibiotics kill bacteria by targeting
essential survival processes.5−9 As reported by several groups, antibiotics have the ability to inhibit
cell wall synthesis which interferes with the bacterial reproduction.3−9 Similarly, antibiotics have the capability to block the synthesis
of vital proteins, DNA and RNA. As a result, it suspends the growth
of bacteria.4−9 Unfortunately, in the last few decades bacteria have acquired resistance
to antibiotics available in the market, and as a result, infections
caused by drug-resistant bacteria cannot be treated easily.5−9

There are several possible mechanisms through which bacteria
become drug resistant, and these are increased efflux due to overexpression
of efflux pumps, enzyme inactivation, decreased cell permeability,
target protection, altered target site/enzyme, etc.2,4−9 For example, it is now well documented that carbapenem-resistant
Enterobacteriaceae Escherichia coli (CRE-E.
coli), Gram-negative bacteria, has the capability to restrict
the entry of antibiotics into the outer membrane.4−9CRE-E. coli is capable of changing the nature of
the cell wall, leading to antibiotics becoming ineffective and the
bacteria becoming resistant to most available antibiotics in the market.5−9 Recent reports indicate that the “super-resistant”
gene New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase 1 (NDM-1), which
exists in multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria, has the capability to
cause enzymatic degradation of β-lactam antibiotics.4−9 As a result, these bacteria became resistant to a broad range of
antibiotics.5−9 For example, Gram-positive bacteria such as Klebsiella pneumoniae have the ability to produce extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL),
which allow Klebsiella pneumoniae to be resistant
to virtually all beta-lactam antibiotics.4−9

In the last two decades, the development of new types of antibiotics
has been declining rapidly, leaving no options to treat resistant
bacteria.2,4−9 As a result, infectious disease treatment has been challenged by
bacteria, which are responsible for more than a million deaths in
this world every year.4−9 As per the world health organization (WHO),3 if we cannot find an alternative way to tackle bacteria, by 2050
drug-resistant bacteria could kill 10 million people/year which is
more than the number of people dying from cancer now. All the above
facts have triggered initiatives in this world for the development
of novel antimicrobial compounds for targeted killing of bacteria.10−20 In the last 25 years, one of the very highly promising approaches
to combating bacteria is nanomaterial=based antibacterial agents.4−30 We and other groups have demonstrated that zero-dimensional (0D)
to two-dimensional (2D) nanomaterial-based approaches can be highly
promising alternatives for bacteria treatment.10−35 0D plasmonic nanoparticles such as silver nanoparticles have been
demonstrated to exhibit high antibacterial activity toward drug-resistant
bacteria.8−20 It is now well documented that nanoparticles combat bacteria via
several different mechanisms,4−15 as shown in Figure 1.

Figure 1 Scheme showing a possible bacteria-combating mechanism of different
nanomaterials via bacterial cell damage, cell component leakage, photodynamic
(PDT) killing via ROS, and photothermal (PTT) killing via disruption
of genomic DNA, proteins, and cellular metabolism.

Nanoparticles have the capability to physically damage the
cell membrane.4−20 They can also generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) and free radicals.21−35 The above process increases the oxidative stress, which enhances
the fragmentation of genomic DNA and damages the cellular structural
integrity.20−35 It is now well documented that nanoparticles exhibit high membrane
permeability in comparison to antibiotics.4−15 Recent reports also indicate that nanoparticle-based antimicrobial
agents have good capacity to act as efflux pump inhibitors.4−20 Due to the above facts, nanomaterial-based antimicrobial agents
are less prone to induce bacterial resistance in comparison to antibiotics
available now in the market.20−35 As a result, scientists have great hope that nanomaterial-based
antibacterial agents will provide a new way to treat antibacterial
infections.4−20

In the last two decades, many different families of nanomaterials
including 0D metal nanoparticles, semiconductor nanodots, and carbon
dots (one-dimensional (1D) nanorods, carbon nanotubes, 2D graphene
oxide (GO), 2D transition metal dichalcogenides (TMD), and heterostructure
materials) have been developed to combat bacterial infection.4−35 In the last decade, we and others have published several review
articles based on 0D and 1D nanomaterial-based antibacterial agents.4−10 In this current mini-review, we have highlighted 2D-GO, TMD, MXene,
and heterostructure material-based approaches to tackle bacteria.4−35 Here we have discussed the major design criteria which has been
used to develop novel antimicrobial nanotherapeutics and various mechanisms
of antibacterial action which have been used to eliminate drug-resistant
bacterial infections. Lastly, we have highlighted the possible challenges
in using 2D GO, TMD, and 2D–0D heterostructure material-based
approaches in practical applications for combating bacteria.

Combating Bacteria
Using 2D-GO- and GO-Based Heterostructures
After the first
observation in 2010 by Hu et al.13 that
graphene oxide (GO) and reduced graphene oxide (rGO) can be used as
antibacterial materials, interest has rapidly grown to develop GO-based
material for combating bacteria.11−25 GO-containing sp2 carbons and oxygen-containing functional
groups such as carboxy, hydroxy, and epoxy allow high dispersion in
aqueous medium.11−25 Due to the ease of synthesis in a large scale, tunable size-dependent
properties, low cytotoxicity, and high biocompatibility, in the last
several years our group and other groups have been developing GO-based
material for biological antimicrobial agents.11−25 As reported by several groups, the antibacterial mechanism of GO
involves both physical and chemical modes of action11−25 as shown in Figure 2A. We and others have shown that chemical modes of action occur via
ROS generation or through direct electron transfer.11−25 On the other hand, several reported experimental data indicate that
physical modes of action occur via direct contact with GO followed
by penetration of the cell membrane.11−25

Liu et al.15 compared Escherichia coli (E. coli) bacteria combating
capability by GO and reduced graphene oxide (rGO) with graphite (Gt)
and graphite oxide (GtO) as shown in Figures 2B–2E. Their
reported data15 show low antibacterial
activity for graphite and graphite oxide, which is mostly due to lower
dispersion stabilities. Their reported data indicate that the antibacterial
performance for GO is ∼69.3% which is much higher than that
of rGO, which is ∼45.9%.15 Scanning
electron microscopy (SEM) data as shown in Figures 2C–2D indicate
that GO-exposed E. coli are almost evenly wrapped
by GO layers.15 On the other hand, rGO
aggregates trap E. coli. Liu et al.15 have argued that after wrapping the sharp edge of graphene
nanosheets has the capability for significant membrane stress,15 where GO layers are acting as “cutters”
to damage cell membranes. Experimental data reported by Liu et al.15 demonstrated that small-sized GO containing
a high density of oxygen-containing functional groups will wrap the
bacterial cells, which will induce membrane stress leading to cell
death.15

Similarly, experimental
data from other groups15−24 also indicate that direct contact between Gram-positive and Gram-negative
bacteria with graphene nanosheets could result in loss of bacterial
membrane integrity and leakage of RNA/DNA. Zhao et al.24 have reported the possible antimicrobial mechanism
associated with aerobic reduction of GO as shown in Figures 2F and 2G. Their reported data24 demonstrated
that GO interacts with membrane-bound cytochrome c of E. coli. Zhao et al.24 have indicated that the above interaction helps for shuttling electrons
from the respiratory chain to extracellular molecular oxygen. As a
result, superoxide anions (O2•–) form, which in turn reduces GO.24 Zhao
et al.24 showed that the reduction process
interrupts the respiration chain and enhances the antimicrobial activity.
From the experimental results, Zhao et al.24 concluded that GO can serve as a conductive bridge to shuttle electrons
from the intracellular respiratory chain to extracellular molecular
oxygen. It also promotes O2•– production,
which in turn reduced GO. The above process severed oxidative damage
of bacteria.24 Liu et al.20 have reported lateral size-dependent antibacterial activities
of GO sheets toward E. coli bacteria. As shown in Figures 3A–C, their
reported data indicate that larger GO sheets exhibit stronger antibacterial
activity than smaller ones. Experimental results using atomic force
microscopy (AFM) analysis indicate GO sheets interact strongly with
cells as shown in Figures 3A,B.20 From AFM data, Liu et al.20 have argued that large GO sheets more easily
cover cells. As a result, cells cannot proliferate once fully covered,
resulting in the cell viability loss.

size of 0.010 μm2 was prepared by sonication for

Chemical Society).

On the other hand, small
GO can adhere to the bacterial surfaces, which allow weaker antibacterial
activity.20 Due to the penetration of the
cell membrane by 2D GO, loss of membrane integrity may happen via
pore formation or extraction of lipid molecules. Palmieri et al.22 reported how GO concentration and the surrounding
media can manipulate the antimicrobial property. As shown in Figure 3D–G, their
experimental data show that at low GO concentration GO cuts microorganism
membranes for S. aureus and E. coli. Palmieri et al.22 have demonstrated
that when the concentration is below 6 μg/mL GO acts as a knife
that cuts bacterial membranes. On the other hand, as GO concentration
increases, the GO killing efficacy increases only in water.22 Their experimental observation, as shown in Figure 3D–G, indicates
that in other solutions, due to the aggregation which shields GO edges,
there is no impact on microbial growth. Their reported experimental
data show that when the concentration is higher than 100 μg/mL
GO cluster size becomes much larger than bacteria.22 As a result, GO aggregates wrap bacteria and impede their
growth. Their studies clearly show that GO versatility can be exploited
for the treatments against multidrug- resistant bacteria.

Several
reports in the last decade indicate that other than membrane stress
mediated via wrapping oxidative stress produced by GO and rGO also
can be the cause of cell death.10−24 It is now well documented that oxidative stress can interfere with
bacterial metabolism.10−20 Oxidative stress induced by nanomaterials also has the capability
to disrupt essential cellular functions, which can lead to cell death.14−24 Oxidative stress usually occurs via two different pathways. The
first one is ROS-dependent, and the second one is the ROS-independent
pathway.10−20 Liu et al.15 have performed in
vitro GSH oxidation test experiments as shown in Figure 2E. Their reported
data clearly indicate that rGOs and Gt are capable of inducing superoxide
anion-independent oxidative stress on bacterial cells. On the other
hand, GO has the lowest GSH oxidation capacities with respect to GT,
GTO, and rGO. From all the experimental data, Liu et al.15 have concluded that graphene-based destruction
of bacteria can be attributed to both membrane damage and oxidative
stress.

It is now well documented that lipid peroxidation, which
is also known as ROS-mediated oxidation of lipid molecules, is a very
important oxidative pathway to kill bacteria.10−24 Krishnamoorthy et al.17 have reported
that graphene nanosheets enhanced the ultrasound-induced lipid peroxidation.
Their reported data show that with respect to the control group lipid
peroxidation increased by 117% and 109% after exposure to 10 and 5
μg/mL of graphene. Zucker et al.19 reported the disruption of phospholipid vesicles due to 2D GO and
cell interactions. Their dye leakage experiment shows that the extent
of membrane integrity loss was dependent on total surface area and
not edge length.19 In the past decade,
heterostructure building blocks using 2D GO, 1D, and 0D materials
have opened unique opportunities to be studied for use as antibacterial
material due to the combined advantages of the individual material.10−20 As we have discussed, although GO is able to kill bacteria, the
killing efficiency is less than 50%. To improve the killing efficiency
to 100%, several heterostructure-based materials have been designed
recently and reported to have the capability for 100% killing of bacteria.10−20 We have reported12 that the PGLa peptide
(Gly-Met-Ala-Ser-Lys-Ala-Gly-Ala-Ile-Ala-Gly-Lys-Ile-Ala-Lys-Val-Ala-Leu-Lys-Ala-Leu-NH2) conjugated CNT-bridged graphene oxide membrane can be used
for disinfection of pathogenic E. coli O157:H7 bacteria.

For the design of heterostructure-based antibacterial material,
as shown in Figures 4A–4C, we have used 1D CNTs to physically
separate 2D graphene oxide sheets from aggregation.12 To increase the percentage of killing efficiency, we have
developed PGLa antimicrobial peptide which has the capability to kill E. coli O157:H7 on contact by interacting with their lipid
membranes.12 As shown in Figures 4A–4C, our experimental disinfection data show that the PGLa peptide
can kill roughly 70% of E. coli O157:H7 bacteria
in the absence of CNT-bridged 3D graphene oxide.12 On the other hand, CNT-bridged 3D graphene can kill only
11% E. coli O157:H7 bacteria without PGLa.12 Our reported data clearly show that PGLa-attached
CNT-bridged 3D graphene oxides are able to kill 100% of E.
coli O157:H7 bacteria.12 We have
concluded that CNT-bridged 3D graphene oxide helps to trap E. coli, and this situation allows PGLa to bind and penetrate
the outer membrane of bacteria and kill E. coli O157:H7
bacteria.12

Xie et al. reported23 the design
of hybrid polydopamine (PDA)/Ag3PO4/GO-based antibacterial
material to achieve rapid bacteria killing and eliminate biofilms
in situ. As shown in Figure 4D–4G, in their design they have
explored the synergistic actions of Ag+ and ROS produced
by Ag3PO4 under irradiation of 660 nm visible
light.23 For this purpose, they have tuned
the bandgap of the Ag3PO4 NPs using GO. The
observed that the synergistic killing mechanism is due to an increase
in the membrane permeability by ROS, which enables Ag+ to
enter the bacteria more easily.23 As a
result, both Ag+ and ROS can destroy the DNA and proteins
synergistically. Their reported experimental data indicate that the
antimicrobial properties for the hybrid vary with the composition
of particles.23 They have argued that due
to the larger specific surface area for the heterostructure it leads
to more effective release of Ag+ and absorption of more
photons to produce ROS.23 As shown in Figure 4G, the histological
section by immunohistochemical staining of neutrophils and lymphocytes
shows excellent photocatalytic antibacterial activity. Feng et al.25 reported a reduced graphene oxide/Au nanostar
(rGO/AuNS) heterostructure based highly effective photothermal agent,
which has the capability to enhance the photothermal conversion in
comparison to the pure rGO nanosheets and AuNS. Their reported data
show that the rGO/AuNS exhibits promising intrinsic antibacterial
activity for MRSA. Very recently, we have reported11 the design of a polydopamine nanoparticle (PDNP) attached
GO-conjugated ε-poly-l-lysine (ε-PL) antimicrobial
peptide based novel heterostructure, which can be used for disinfection
of drug-resistant pathogens from environmental samples. Reported data
show that11 a PDNP-attached GO-conjugated
ε-poly-l-lysine (ε-PL) based heterostructure
can be used for capturing 100% bacteria. Experimental drug-resistant
bacteria killing data11 demonstrated that
the heterostructure has the capability to eradicate different drug-resistant
bacteria such as β-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Klebsiella
pneumoniae (KPN) and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus
aureus (MRSA). Shoeb et al.21 have
reported a graphene/polyindole (Gr@PIn) heterostructure-based antibacterial
nanocomposite for the treatment of MRSA skin infection in BALB/c mice.
Their reported experimental results21 show
that Gr@PIn nanocomposites are highly effective in inhibiting MRSA.

Their experimental data21 with BALB/c
mice, as shown in Figure 5A–5D, show that the graphene-based
heterostructure has great potential to prevent bacterial infection
under in vivo environments using an S. aureus-mediated
skin contagion in BALB/c mice. Reported data21 indicate that right after the treatment using Gr@PIn nanocomposites
the skin attained a typical architecture. Shoeb et al.21 have shown that the Gr@PIn nanocomposite can
potentially damage the cell wall of MRSA and successfully inhibit
the biofilm formation.

In this section, we have
discussed 2D-GO and heterostructure-based design of antibacterial
strategy for killing bacteria. The reported antibacterial mechanism
of GO involves wrapping of the bacteria membrane. However, the detailed
understanding on why the wrapped bacteria are killed is lacking. As
a result, detailed studies need to be conducted to find the actual
mechanism behind the wrapping-based bacteria killing which depends
on the concentration, size, exposure time, and cell type. The second
proposed mechanism of GO-based killing bacteria is oxidative stress,
which involves oxidation or dysfunction of cellular membranes. An
accurate determination of the nature of physicochemical properties
for 2D-GO which control oxidative stress based antimicrobial killing
is lacking. Killing of bacteria via the extraction of lipid bilayers
also has been proposed, but the mechanism of lipid extraction is in
its infancy. As a result, more detailed studies are urgent. Therefore,
a systematic collaborative study is urgently needed to determine the
mechanism behind GO-based antibacterial activity.

Combating Bacteria
Using 2D-MoS2- and MoS2-Based Heterostructures
Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are a unique class of 2D
nanomaterials for the possible applications in drug delivery, phototherapy
of cancer and bacteria, as well as its use as antibacterial wound
healing agents.10,24−31 Since TMDs have bandgaps in contrast to the zero bandgap of graphene,
TMD has been studied for possible photonics, optoelectronics, and
other applications.10,24−31 After the first observation in 2014 by Yang et al.26 that two-dimensional (2D) chemically exfoliated MoS2 can be used as antibacterial materials, the interest has
rapidly grown to develop MoS2-based material for combating
bacteria.10,24−31 For this purpose, MoS2 nanosheets were functionalized
with either hydrophobic ligands or antimicrobial peptides.10,24−31 Recently several reports indicate that the NIR-responsive MoS2 nanosheets can be combined with functionalities for designing
photothermal, photocatalytic, and chemical disinfection systems.10,24−31 Similarly, we and others have demonstrated that by combining with
other antibacterial nanomaterials such as silver, gold, and graphene
oxide one can develop highly potent antibacterial nanocomposites using
MoS2-based heterostructure materials.10,24−31 Yang et al.26 have found that chemically
exfoliated MoS2 sheets have the capability to produce reactive
oxygen species (ROS). They have suggested that antimicrobial activity
for chemically exfoliated MoS2 sheets is due to membrane
damage and oxidation stress. Pandit et al.30 demonstrated that functionalized chemically exfoliated MoS2 can be used as a highly effective antibiotic agent against Gram-positive
and Gram-negative pathogens as shown in Figure 6A–6E.30 They have tested the antibacterial properties
for exfoliated MoS2 against MRSA and P. aeruginosa and their corresponding biofilms.30 As
shown in Figure 6A,
in their design of positively charged MoS2, the hydrophobicity
was varied by changing the alkane chain length. Figure 6D shows the position of functionalized MoS2 as an antibacterial agent compared to other materials. Pandit
et al.30 have reported minimum inhibitory
concentration (MIC) for functionalized MoS2 against MRSA
and P. aeruginosa. Their reported data30 indicate that for C1MoS2 the MIC
value is 1.88 ppm. On the other hand, the reported MIC values for
C6MoS2 and C8MoS2 are 156 and 78 ppb, respectively.30

Figure 6 (A) Scheme shows the functionalized ce-MoS2 with thiol ligands of varied charge and hydrophobicity. (B) SEM
image of untreated MRSA without treatment using functionalized ce-MoS2. (C) SEM images of MRSA after treating it with 2.5 ×

molecules. (E) Abiotic glutathione oxidation assay for quantification
of oxidative stress generated (adapted with permission from ref (30). Copyright 2016, American
Chemical Society).

Their reported high antibacterial
activity using functionalized MoS2 is due to the net negative
charge of bacterial surfaces and the positive charge of functionalized
MoS2. As a result, functionalized MoS2 is highly
effective to kill bacteria. As reported in Figures 6E, their experimental data indicate that
functionalized materials generate less oxidative stress than exfoliated
MoS2. A detailed mechanistic study reported by Pandit et
al.30 indicates that ROS-independent oxidative
stress generation as well as depolarization of the bacterial membrane
are responsible for destroying bacteria using functionalized MoS2.30 Importantly, reported experimental
data30 demonstrated that by altering the
hydrophobicity of positively charged MoS2 one can tune
the antibacterial pathway between oxidative stress and depolarization
of the bacterial membrane.

Recently, we have reported10 the design of the melittin antimicrobial peptide
(AMP) attached MoS2-based antibacterial agent for synergistic
inactivation of 100% multidrug-resistant bacteria by the combined
photothermal therapy (PTT), photodynamic therapy (PDT), and antimicrobial
peptide (AMP) process, as shown in Figure 7A–7C. Our reported
experimental data10 show that using the
synergistic killing mechanism of AMP-attached MoS2 has
the capability to kill 100% MRSA, E. coli, and KPN
bacteria. In our design,10 the MoS2-based nanoplatform killed bacteria via an external NIR light-triggered
combined photothermal and photodynamic mechanism. On the other hand,
melittin antimicrobial peptide has been used to kill bacteria by pore
formation as shown in Figure 7B.10 As shown in Figure 7C, our reported experimental
data demonstrated that only 28% of multidrug-resistant bacteria (MDRB)
killing is possible using a MoS2-based nanoplatform. On
the other hand, only 20% of bacteria can be killed by the melittin
antimicrobial peptide alone. Reported data10 clearly show that 100% of bacteria can be killed using a nanoplatform
with NIR light. The observed synergistic killing mechanism is due
to the fact that in the presence of the PEG-MoS2-AMP nanoplatform
initially the melittin AMP makes pores on the surface of MDRB. Pores
formed by AMP help to diffuse heat and ROS easily during PDT and PTT.
Due to the above possible synergistic multimodal killing mechanism,
100% of MDRB was killed.10 To understand
better about the membrane pore formation, we have performed a bacterial
ATP leakage experiment using the ATP determination kit.10 Our reported data10 indicate a high amount of leakage of cellular ATP even at the concentration
of 2.8 μg/mL. Recently, Roy et al.28 have reported the design of chitosan-exfoliated MoS2 nanosheets
(CS-MoS2) as antibacterial agents. They have evaluated
the antibacterial activity against both Gram-negative and -positive
bacteria, which indicates that CS-MoS2 nanosheets have
the capability for growth inhibition of both Gram-negative and Gram-positive
bacteria in a concentration- and time-dependent manner, as shown in Figure 7D–7E.28

Figure 7 (A) Scheme shows the
synthetic procedure that was used for the development of an antimicrobial
peptide attached MoS2 nanoplatform. (B) Scheme shows the
development of antibacterial for bacteria using an antimicrobial peptide

activity. (E) Effect of chitosan-exfoliated MoS2 nanosheets

They have determined MIC and minimum bactericidal concentration
(MBC) of the CS-MoS2 nanosheets against both E.
coli and S. aureus as shown in Figure 7E. Their reported
data28 indicate that the MIC and MBC values
of CS-MoS2 nanosheets against E. coli are
30 and 60 μg/mL, respectively. Similarly, the MIC and MBC values
for S. aureus are found to be 90 and 120 μg/mL,
respectively.28 From their reported data28 they have concluded that due to the presence
of a thick peptidoglycan layer surrounding the Gram-positive S. aureus it required a higher concentration of CS-MoS2 for achieving antibacterial activity.28 Experimental data reported by Roy et al.28 indicated that the CS-MoS2 nanosheets induced
bacterial cell death through a combined action of membrane damage,
metabolic inactivation, and oxidative stress. The detailed mechanistic
study indicates that the antibacterial activity of CS-MoS2 nanosheets happens through a multistep process, and these are membrane
damage, metabolic inactivation, and oxidative stress.28 They have concluded that CS-MoS2 nanosheets
can probably be used as antibacterial coatings, wound dressings, and
ultrafiltration membranes for potential biomedical and environmental
applications.28

Cao et al. have reported29 the design of a poly(dimethyldiallylammonium
chloride) (PDDA)-Ag+-Cys-MoS2 heterostructure and their
antimicrobial properties. Their reported data as shown in Figure 8A–8D indicate that the PDDA-Ag+-Cys-MoS2 exhibited enhanced broad-spectrum antibacterial activity for Gram-negative E. coli and Gram-positive S. aureus.29 On the other hand, their reported data show
extremely low antibacterial ability for equivalent amounts of AgNP
or AgNO3 solution. Reported in vitro and in vivo antibacterial experiments indicate that cationic
polyelectrolyte promoted the adhesion of PDDA-Ag+-Cys-MoS2.29 From the experimental data, they have
concluded that PDDAAg+- Cys-MoS2 could release large amounts
of Ag+ ions at the cell walls of microorganisms.29 As shown in Figure 8A–8D, for in vivo experiment, Cao et al. have used the infected wound
model. For this purpose, the back of the mice was slashed and injected
with 1 × 106 of MRSA.29 In the next step, the mice were divided into seven groups, based
on treatment with PBS buffer, AgNO3, AgNPs, PDDA, Cys-MoS2, Ag+-Cys-MoS2, and PDDA-Ag+-Cys-MoS2.29 Their experimental
data, as shown in Figure 8, show that for control groups a fragmentary epidermal layer
appeared on the wound after 3 day treatments.29 On the other hand, the intact epidermal layer emerged on the wound
treated with PDDA-Ag+-Cys-MoS2 dressing for 3 days.29 Their reported data clearly show that PDDA-Ag+-
Cys-MoS2 exhibited the best antibacterial effect and wound
healing.29

In this section, we have discussed 2D-MoS2 and heterostructure-based design of antibacterial strategy for killing
bacteria. We have highlighted some of the proposed antibacterial mechanisms
and latest developments in the practical antimicrobial applications
for TMD and TMD-based heterostructures. Since 2D-MoS2-based
antibacterial agent design is in the very early stages, the antibacterial
mechanism has not been completely understood. Computational simulation
studies are very important to analyze the interactions between 2D-TMD
materials and biological components which will enable the determination
of the possible mechanism. As a result, in-depth investigations are
urgently needed to find out the mechanisms and different parameters
influencing the antibacterial activity for TND-based materials.

Combating Bacteria Using 2D-MXenes and Heterostructures
The emerging MXenes, a new family of multifunctional 2D materials,
exhibit metallic conductivity, hydrophilic nature, and unique physiochemical
performances.32−35 As a result, in the past few years, transition metal carbides, nitrides,
and carbonitride-based MXenes have been introduced as novel inorganic
nanosystems for biologic and biomedical applications.32−35 After, the first MXene, multilayered Ti3C2, was developed in 2011,32 a series of
2D MXenes were designed.33−35 For the last eight years, few
groups have explored possible applications in energy storage, theranostic
material, chemical and biomedical sensors, etc.33−35 After the first
observation in 2016 by Rasoo et al.33 that
two-dimensional Ti3C2Tx MXenes can be used as antibacterial materials, the interest
has rapidly grown to develop MXene-based material for combating bacteria.33−35 Rasoo et al.33 tested the antibacterial
properties of Ti3C2Tx against Escherichia
coli (E. coli) and Bacillus subtilis (B. subtilis). Their reported data as shown in Figures 9B–9D indicate
that Ti3C2Tx exhibits a higher antibacterial
efficiency toward E. coli and B. subtilis comparable with GO.33 As shown in Figure 9D, their experimental
data on concentration-dependent antibacterial activity indicate more
than 98% bacterial cell viability in the presence of 200 μg/mL
of Ti3C2Tx.33 Antibacterial
mechanistic investigation data by Rasoo et al.33 show the damage to the cell membrane which kills bacteria.

Shamsabadi et al.34 have reported size-dependent
antibacterial properties of MXene. For this purpose, they have tested
antibacterial activity for nanosheets with lateral sizes of 0.09,
0.35, 0.57, and 4.40 μm against Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis bacteria.34 Their reported data indicate that smaller nanosheets exhibit
higher antibacterial activities against both bacteria.34 The schematic representations of the proposed
antibacterial mode-of-action of Ti3C2Tx MXene
nanosheets are shown in Figure 9A. Reported antibacterial mechanism studies indicate that
interactions between the sharp edges of the Ti3C2Tx MXene nanosheets and bacteria membrane play an important role
in antibacterial properties of the nanosheets.34 From the experimental data, Shamsabadi et al.34 have concluded that MXene damages the bacterial
cell wall significantly in less than 3 h by releasing DNA from the
cytosol. Alimohammadi et al.35 have reported
the comparison of antibacterial activity of vertically aligned different
2D heterostructures such as MnO2/GO, MoS2/rGO,
and MoS2/MXene. Experimental results by Alimohammadi et
al.35 show that a vertically aligned 2D
nanosheet motif exhibits higher antibacterial activity than 2D nanomaterials,
as shown in Figure 9F–9G. Their reported experimental data
indicate that the number of viable bacteria became 90% when B. subtilis was treated with MoS2.35 On the other hand, the number of viable bacteria
became 60% and 75%, when B. subtilis was treated
with MoS2/rGO and MoS2/MXene, respectively.35

In this section, we have discussed 2D-MXene
and heterostructure-based design of antibacterial material for killing
bacteria. We have highlighted very recent developments in the antimicrobial
applications for 2D-MXene and 2D-MXene-based heterostructures. Since
only in the past few years antibacterial properties for 2D-MXene have
been realized the antibacterial mechanism is poorly understood, where
further studies are very important. A systematic collaborative in vivo experimental study is highly necessary to understand
the environmental impacts and the interaction between 2D-MXene with
different organisms, before it can be used for society.

Although
we have only highlighted 2D-GO, MoS2, MXene, and heterostructure
material-based antimicrobial strategies, some other 2D materials such
as layered double hydroxides (LDHs), hexagonal boron nitride (BN),
2D metal oxides, and 2D kaolinite are also emerging as potential antibacterial
agents.4−9

Summary
In conclusion, in the current mini-review we have
discussed recent advancements on 2D-GO, MoS2, MXene, and
heterostructural material-based antimicrobials, which have the capability
to be used for disinfection of bacteria in vivo and ex vivo applications. Reported data from several groups
have demonstrated that the tunable surface functionality of 2D-GO,
MoS2, MXene, and heterostructures has the ability to provide
a versatile platform to combat drug-resistant bacterial infections.
We have discussed how the material design can be tailored for heterostructure-based
antimicrobial nanocomposites to tackle the multidrug-resistant problem.
The current state of the art 2D and heterostructure material based
animal model data show that the nanomaterial has strong potential
to treat topical skin infections in the near future. We hope that
the current mini-review will provide researchers to realize the potential
of 2D multifunctional materials for combating bacteria.

Challenges
Although from the reported data we can realize that 2D-GO, MoS2, MXene, and heterostructures have the capability for combating
bacteria, it is still too early to apply 2D and heterostructure-based
antibacterial material for real life clinical applications. Large-scale
and low-cost design of 2D and heterostructure-based antibacterial
material with high reproducibility is very important for practical
use, which is lacking until now. The fabrication process needs to
be designed in such a way that 2D and heterostructure-based antibacterial
material should retain activity in complex biological media. Since
for clinical applications 2D-GO, MoS2, MXene, and heterostructural
material-based antimicrobials can be given through either skin contact,
oral, or intravenous injection, a thorough in vivo model must be evaluated to better understand their potential toxicity,
clearance, and metabolism. We really need to understand the biodegradability
of sheet-structured 2D materials inside the body. The central questions
we need to determine is whether intravenously injected 2D-GO, MoS2, MXene, and heterostructural material-based antimicrobials
accumulate in the colon, lung, bone marrow, liver, spleen, and lymphatics?
The pharmacological profiles of 2D and heterostructure-based antibacterial
material are essential for the clinical translation, which is missing
now. Interdisciplinary research evaluating these aspects needs to
be performed very carefully, which will allow us to establish 2D and
heterostructure nanomaterials as effective next-generation antimicrobials
for bacteria.
