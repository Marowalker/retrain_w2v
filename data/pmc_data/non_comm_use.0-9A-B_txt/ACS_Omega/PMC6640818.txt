Living systems are categorically
a kinetic state of matter that
exhibits complex functions and emergent behaviors. By contrast, synthetic
systems are relatively simple and are typically controlled by the
thermodynamic parameters. To understand this inherent difference between
the biological and synthetic systems, novel approaches are of vital
importance. In this regard, we have designed a three-component molecular
system (a triad) by conjugating an amino acid with two functional
molecules (naphthalenediimide and pyrene), which facilitates kinetically
controlled self-assemblies. Herein, we describe three different molecular
aggregation states of triads (entitled State I, State II, and State
III) and also the dynamic pathway complexities associated with their
transformations from one state to another. By meticulously employing
the triads of different molecular aggregation states and the stereochemical
information of the amino acid, we report emergent behaviors termed
“supramolecular speciation” and “supramolecular
regulation”. Further, we present a hitherto unknown emergent
property in a self-assembled state under the majority-rules experiment,
which has been termed “super-nonlinearity”. This work
provides novel insights into complex synthetic systems having unprecedented
functions and properties. Such emergent behaviors of synthetic triads
that involve an interplay among complex interactions may find relevance
in the context of prebiotic chemical evolution.

Introduction
Living cells embody
an exclusive collection of self-assembled molecular
entities that by themselves are nonliving in nature.1−3 Nonetheless, through the delicate interplay of an interactive network
of molecular ensembles, they exhibit emergent properties such as self-reproduction
(self-replication/autocatalysis), self-maintenance (autoregulation),
and Darwinian evolution.4−22 Emergence is the process by which complex systems and patterns arise
out of a multitude of relatively simple interactions. Emergent behaviors
are often unpredictable and unprecedented and represent the advanced
stages of the system’s evolution. In spite of our expertise
to invariably synthesize almost all biomolecules in the laboratory,
synthetic systems that can showcase emergent properties and complex
lifelike functions as well as their underlying molecular mechanisms
are relatively unknown. In this context, we present a kinetically
controlled synthetic molecular system that exhibits emergent behaviors
such as supramolecular speciation, supramolecular regulation, super-nonlinearity,
and chiral denaturation.

Almost all synthetic molecular assemblies
are thermodynamically controlled,
whereas living systems
are a kinetic state of matter that maintains a far-from-equilibrium
state.23−26 The kinetically controlled systems enable the regulation of their
behavior depending on the changes in the surrounding medium.27−38 Moreover,
it is rather difficult to emulate such biomolecular systems with synthetic
molecular systems (except analogues) because biomolecular systems
possess highly specific biofunctions and unparalleled structure–property
relationships.39−42 In this scenario, it was envisioned that a modular system consisting
of simple biomolecular auxiliaries and synthetic functional molecules
would be a propitious design strategy to effectively engineer molecular
assemblies and to provide better opportunities to emulate biological
systems.43−46 Amino acids are a particularly attractive pool of auxiliaries because
of their extraordinary molecular recognition and stereoselective and
sequence-specific self-assembling properties.47 Remarkably, several billion years of evolution has enabled the amino
acids to integrate chemical groups (either individually or in the
form of peptides/proteins) that facilitate multiple interactions such
as hydrogen bonding and hydrophilic, hydrophobic, and aromatic interactions
rather synergistically via their compact size and positions. Thus,
it was envisaged that by derivatizing functional abiotic molecules
with amino acids, a wide variety of functional systems with novel
properties and applications can be achieved. Befittingly, it was demonstrated
that amino acid-appended functional molecules can be kinetically trapped
in organic solvents of appropriate polarity (namely, acetonitrile
and dimethyl sulfoxide), which, in turn, can be hydrophobically triggered
to undergo spontaneous self-assembly in an aqueous environment or
subjected to temporal assembly under solvophobic forces.45,46,48

Herein, with an objective
to systematically enhance the complexity
of the molecular design and their interactions via a simplistic approach,
naphthalenediimide (NDI) and pyrene were used as functional molecules
that possess a wide variety of promising applications.43,49,50 Interestingly, the complementary
π-character of NDI (π-acidic) and pyrene (π-basic)
had earlier enabled us to engineer the molecular assemblies via their
π–π stacking interaction energies.51 In the present work, pyrene–NDI–pyrene conjugates
interlinked with alanine, phenylalanine, and isoleucine have been
reported, which modulate self-assemblies of the derived triads via
distinct stereochemical information (Figure 1). Herein, we use the term “triad”
to denote our molecular system having three components, namely, NDI,
pyrene, and the amino acid. LL, DD, LD, and RAC are alanine-appended triads, whereas C1 and C2 are phenylalanine- and isoleucine-appended
triads, respectively. LL, DD, and LD represent the stereochemistry of the alanine linker, whereas
the RAC triad was synthesized using a racemic mixture
of the alanine precursor. In contrast to the alanine-based triads, C1 and C2 serve as controls for the study, which
demonstrates that minute structural mutations can also restrain the
temporal assembly behavior as well as the emergent properties.

Figure 1 The generic
molecular structure of amino acid-interlinked NDI and
the pyrene-based triad. The stereochemistries of amino acids for the
respective triads are tabled on the right side. Homochiral (LL & DD) and heterochiral (RAC & LD) molecules that are kinetically trapped in
the dimeric/oligomeric state in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone
(NMP) undergo homogeneous/heterogeneous nucleation and successive
elongation by supramolecular polymerization in aqueous NMP to ultimately
form respective nanoarchitectures.

Results and Discussion
Dynamic Molecular Self-Assembly
Ultraviolet–visible
(UV–vis) absorption spectra of the triads (LL/DD/RAC/LD) in NMP showed characteristic
absorption bands in the region of 270–400 nm because of the
π–π* transitions of NDI and pyrene (Figure S2).43 The
triads were hydrophobically triggered to undergo π–π
stacking in aqueous NMP (having different volume percentages of water
in NMP). Under the enhanced hydrophobic forces of water, a new broad
absorption band (400–650 nm) was observed because of the intermolecular
charge transfer interaction between NDI and pyrene moieties.51 The triads were further probed using CD studies
to understand the nature of their helical assembly. In aqueous NMP, LL showed the characteristic sigmoid-shaped temporal self-assembly
(Figure 2a). The differences
in the kinetic nature of the sigmoidal traces of LL in
aqueous NMP reflect the effect of enhanced hydrophobic forces on their
helical assemblies. The CD signals arising from the excitonic coupling
of transition dipole moments of NDI and pyrene were found to have
distinct spectral features as a function of solvent composition (Figure 2b,c). Notably, three
main aggregation states could be described, namely, State I, State
II, and State III. For up to 34% of the aqueous content in NMP, LL retained State I. With the successive increase in water
content, transition from State I to State II (40% aqueous NMP) and,
in turn, to State III (46% aqueous NMP) was observed. On the other
hand, the DD enantiomer exhibited spectral features similar
to those of LL, with some interesting variations (Figure 2d). Herein, the transition
from State I to State II occurred at 30% of the aqueous content in
NMP (Figure 2e), instead
of 34%, as in the case of LL (Figure 2b). The transition from State I to State
II was completed at 36% aqueous NMP, above which a transition to State
III occurred (Figure 2e,f).

Figure 2 Time-dependent circular dichroism (CD) spectra of 200 μM
solutions of (a) LL (monitored at 350 nm) and (d) DD (monitored at 360 nm) in aqueous NMP. The values represent
the various volume percentages of water in NMP. The corresponding
CD spectra in (b,c) and (e,f) display the distinct aggregation states
of LL and DD, respectively.

Interestingly, an unprecedented sequential transition
encompassing
all three distinct aggregation states of DD in 36% aqueous
NMP was observed (Figure 3a). Such automated aggregation pathway complexities involving
transitions from State I to State III and, in turn, to State II occurring
over a timescale of several minutes may be highlighted as one of the
striking aspects of this molecular system.52,53 The above-described molecular self-assembly behavior indicates four
solvent compositions, namely, 30%, 36%, 40%, and 46% of the aqueous
NMP (denoted as Sol30, Sol36, Sol40, and Sol46, respectively), wherein
different combinations of the LL and DD aggregation
states exist (Figure S3).

amplitudes for the majority-rules experiment in Sol30, Sol34, Sol40,
and Sol46. Sol30 and Sol34 were monitored at 277 nm. Sol40 and Sol46
were monitored at 280 nm.

In Figure 3b, a
plot of the solvent composition has been shown against the time at
which 50% of aggregation occurs (termed T50) to illustrate the relative differences in the aggregation dynamics
of LL and DD. Expectedly, RAC did not show any CD signals in NMP and aqueous NMP, suggesting the
absence of any enantiomeric excesses to induce a biased helical assembly
(Figure S4). In addition, LD also did not show any CD signals in NMP because of an opposing biasing
effect of the L and D isomers. However, under enhanced hydrophobic
forces, LD showed bisignated CD signals because of probable
chiral symmetry breaking.

Majority-Rules Experiment
The existence
of the distinct
aggregation states of LL and DD led us to
envisage the majority-rules experiment, wherein two enantiomers of
different stoichiometric ratios are mixed together to enable interesting
self-assembly behaviors.54 In Sol30, both LL and DD existed independently in State I; here,
the majority-rules experiment did not show any appreciable CD signal
amplification, indicating fidelity behavior (Figure S5). Similarly, in Sol36, minimal CD signal amplification was
observed, wherein LL and DD independently
existed in State I and State II, respectively. However, in Sol40,
mixtures of LL (that independently existed in State II)
and DD (that independently existed in State III) displayed
a hitherto unknown dynamic assembly behavior under the majority-rules
condition. The sigmoidal time course for various stoichiometric ratios
of the enantiomers LL and DD reflected unusual
cooperativity (Figure 3c).55 Further, the CD spectral features
recorded after the temporal studies were remarkably different from
those of LL or DD (Figure 3d). These distinguishable CD spectral features
suggest the formation of distinct aggregation states for various stoichiometric
ratios of LL and DD. The distinct CD spectral
features indicate supramolecular speciation in terms of the helical
organization, which involves the formation of respective heterogeneous
nuclei and successive elongation by supramolecular polymerization.17 This archetypal speciation at the supramolecular
level involving structural reorganization (vide infra) of dynamically
formed aggregates for various compositions of LL and DD represents the advanced stage of system’s evolution.

The plot of CD amplitude at 280 nm against the enantiomeric excesses
clearly showed a set of nonlinear data points (Figure 3e). Typically, fidelity assembly behavior
of enantiomers results in a linear plot, as represented by the dashed
green line in Figure 3e. In the case of CD signal amplification due to majority rules,
the best possible system would have data points along the dashed orange
line as shown in Figure 3e.54 Nonlinear plots under majority rules
arise from the mixed stacking of minor and major enantiomers in a
single column, giving rise to strong and weak CD signals at low and
high enantiomeric excess values, respectively. Besides the experimental
observation in molecular and macromolecular systems, theoretical validation
of such conventional nonlinearity has been reported in the literature.56 Surprisingly, data points in Figure 3e are well over the limits
of conventional nonlinearity, and the nature of the resulting spectra
is also quite distinct from that of LL or DD. To the best of our knowledge, this anomalous behavior is the first
case of a novel emergent property in a molecularly self-assembled
system and
it has been specifically termed “super-nonlinearity.”
Remarkably, a careful inspection revealed that the plot of CD amplitude
at 480 nm (charge transfer band57) for
various enantiomeric excesses was complementary to that at 280 nm
(Figure 3e). Notably,
the CD amplitude for a fixed concentration of specific molecular species
(molar extinction coefficient) depends on the interchromophore distance
and the angle between their transition dipole moments. Thus, the observed
CD spectral changes strongly suggest that LL and DD undergo a significant structural reorganization at the
supramolecular level for various stoichiometric ratios, thereby leading
to the observed emergent property. Similarly, various stoichiometric
ratios of LL (that independently existed in State III)
and DD (that independently existed in State III) in Sol46
also displayed distinct CD spectral features (Figure S6). Once again, the plot of CD intensity against the
enantiomeric excesses showed nonlinearity well over the conventional
type. Thus, it is evident that the solvent compositions of Sol30,
Sol36, Sol40, and Sol46 determine the nature of the supramolecular
species (helical aggregates) formed by the mixture of LL and DD, thereby reflecting the solvophobic effect on
their kinetic stability (Figure 3f). It is important to note that for a specific solvent
composition (e.g., Sol40), the hydrophobic force imposed is fixed
whereas the nature of the supramolecular species formed is distinct
and therefore it reflects the formation of different kinetic species
for various stoichiometric ratios of LL and DD.

Sergeants-and-Soldiers Experiment
The triads were further
subjected to a modified version of the sergeants-and-soldiers experiment,
wherein increasing concentrations of the “soldier” (RAC or LD) was added to a fixed concentration
of the “sergeant” (enantiomers LL or DD), with the anticipation of achieving stereoselective amplification
behavior.58 When LL (100 μM)
was added to RAC in various stoichiometric ratios (25–100
μM) in Sol40, sigmoidal time courses were observed, indicating
cooperativity (Figure 4a). Moreover, the corresponding CD spectra showed the transition
from State I to State II upon addition of RAC to LL (Figure 4b). A similar behavior was observed in the experiment performed with DD upon addition of RAC to Sol40, except that
the transition was from State III to State II (Figure S7). Further, the fate of the resulting aggregates,
if a heterochiral LD replaced RAC, was investigated.
Here as well, upon addition of LD, the cooperative process
and the characteristic transition from State I to State II for LL and a transition from State III to State II for DD were observed (Figure S8). To probe the
effect of solvent composition, if any, on the transition of aggregation
states, additional studies were performed in Sol46. Interestingly,
successive addition of RAC to LL or DD in Sol46 revealed the transition from State III to State
II via a cooperative process (Figures 4c,d and S7). A similar transition
from State III to State II via a cooperative process was also observed
with the successive addition of LD to LL or DD in Sol46 (Figure S9). It should be noted that because of the relative differences in
the self-assembly characteristics of LL and DD as a function of solvent composition (Figure 3b), typical sigmoidal curves having a lag
phase are not observed in some cases. For such cases, by employing
lower concentrations of the sergeant and soldier, typical sigmoidal
curves can be obtained. From the above experiments, it is evident
that irrespective of solvent compositions (Sol40/Sol46) and the stereochemistry
(RAC/LD) of the moieties added to LL or DD, a transition from either State I or
State III to State II occurred. This characteristic property of the
molecular system to mitigate the formation of State II from various
constraints (detailed above) is termed “supramolecular regulation.”

Mechanism and Discussion
Concentration-dependent studies
revealed that the transition from State I to State II could be achieved
in Sol40 by increasing the concentration of LL from 100
to 200 μM (Figure S12). On the other
hand, DD showed the existence of State III in the concentration
range of 50–200 μM in Sol40. Further, the temperature-dependent
CD studies showed that all of the three aggregation states (State
I–III) of LL and DD were kinetically
controlled aggregates.55 State I was a
kinetically trapped state because the aggregates did not melt even
at 90 °C, whereas State II and State III exhibited chiral denaturation
behavior, as described in an earlier report (Figure 4e–g).46 The differences in the trajectories of the heating and cooling cycles
of State II and State III indicated that the self-assembly was not
under thermodynamic control. As the transitions from State III to
State II are evident from sergeants-and-soldiers experiments and the
temporal assembly of DD in Sol36 (Figure 3a), State III and State II were termed “kinetically
controlled” (kinetically less stable) aggregates and “pseudo-thermodynamically-controlled”
(kinetically more stable) aggregates, respectively, under these conditions.
The aggregates formed under majority-rules and sergeants-and-soldiers
experiments were also kinetic in nature and exhibited the characteristic
chiral denaturation behavior (Figure S13).

Morphological studies provided additional evidence to support
the existence of different aggregation states of this molecular system.
The kinetically trapped State I (for both LL and DD) showed a spherical architecture of 1–4 μm
diameter (Figure 5a,b).
States II and III of LL and DD exhibited
right-handed and left-handed helical nanofibers, respectively (Figure 5c–f). These
helical nanofibers were of 10–25 nm width and 25–55
nm helical pitch. Also, there were no appreciable morphological differences
between the respective States II and III of LL and DD. Expectedly, the aggregates formed under the majority-rules
experiment by the cooperative assembly of LL and DD enantiomers resulted in nanobelts of 10–100 nm width
(Figure 5g–i).
On the other hand, RAC formed nanobelts that were several
micrometers long and 10–100 nm wide; LD resulted
in shorter nanobelts of similar lateral dimensions (Figure 5j,k). Interestingly,
the aggregates formed from the mixture of LL (or DD) and RAC revealed nanobelt (15–100
nm width) architectures, whereas the aggregates formed from the mixture
of LL (or DD) and LD showed
spherical (15–200 nm diameter) agglomerates (Figures 5l,m and S19). Additionally, the formation of nonhelical (15–100
nm width) architectures of LL and DD after
a heating–cooling cycle provided compelling evidence in favor
of chiral denaturation (Figure 5n,o).

cycle.

The sigmoidal traces that evidently
involve the nucleation–elongation-based
supramolecular polymerization were further utilized to extract kinetic
parameters (Figure 1 and Supporting Information). With the
aid of kinetic analysis carried out in MATLAB, we show that two kinetic
models can perfectly fit our sigmoidal traces. The two-step and four-step
kinetic models proposed in this work are the Finke–Watsky (F–W)
two-step single-autocatalytic mechanism (two rate constants k1 and k2) and the
four-step double-autocatalytic mechanism (four rate constants k1, k2, k3, and k4), respectively.59,60 The F–W two-step model is widely used to analyze the kinetics
of protein aggregation because it is the simplest kinetic model that
can clearly deconvolute the nucleation and elongation steps.59,61−63 Recently, a simulation study to understand the nucleation–elongation-based
self-assembly kinetics of conjugated molecules was also described
using the F–W two-step autocatalytic model.64

The concentration- and solvent composition-dependent
kinetic traces
of DD were found to follow the two-step kinetic mechanism.
On the other hand, LL showed the two-step pathway at
lower concentrations and low water content in aqueous NMP, while exhibiting
the four-step mechanism at higher concentrations and high aqueous
content in the solvent composition. For example, a 125 μM solution
of LL in Sol40 revealed a two-step mechanism with k1 = 2.8095 × 10–07 and k2 = 3.1886 × 10–04, whereas
the 200 μM solution of LL in Sol38 exhibited a
four-step pathway with k1 = 1.545 ×
10–09, k2 = 2.355 ×
10–04, k3 = 4.065 ×
10–05, and k4 = 4.306
× 10–05. The latter case of the four-step mechanism
of LL could be ascribed to the formation of higher order
aggregates under enhanced hydrophobic forces and at higher concentrations.

Many of the kinetic traces of majority-rules and sergeants-and-soldiers
experiments were found to fit both two-step and four-step mechanisms,
whereas for a few cases, the four-step model was found to be a better
fit. The selection of two-step or four-step mechanism under the majority-rules
and sergeants-and-soldiers experiments for a specific chemical composition
is thought to depend on the kinetic stability of the heterogeneous
nucleus, which can then facilitate the elongation via supramolecular
polymerization (Figure 1).

The majority-rules experiments carried out under different
environmental
constraints imposed by the solvent media, namely, Sol30, Sol36, Sol40,
and Sol46, suggest that two kinetic systems may be necessary for the
emergent properties, whereas the cooperativity between them appears
to play the most crucial role (Figure S1). LL and DD independently exist in State
II and State III in Sol40, respectively, whereas they both exist in
State III in Sol46; therefore, the existence of distinct aggregation
states is not necessary to achieve the emergent super-nonlinearity.
It is to be noted that the spontaneous assembly of LL and DD, as in Sol46, can also lead to super-nonlinearity
analogous to their temporal assembly in Sol40. Although LL was found to follow both two-step and four-step mechanisms, the
concentrations of LL employed under the majority-rules
and sergeants-and-soldiers experiments were not more than 100 μM.
Hence, it is appropriate to conclude that two different types of kinetic
mechanisms are also not necessary for anomalous self-assembly behaviors
(Figure S12). In contrast, the present
studies reveal that C1 and C2 do not show
any temporal or unusual assembly behavior, possibly because of their
bulky hydrophobic side chains that facilitate rapid aggregation in
aqueous NMP and also engender additional hindrance for the interactions
between the NDI and pyrene functionalities (Figure S4).

Experimental Section
Materials
1,4,5,8-Naphthalenetetracarboxylic
acid dianhydride,
1-pyrenemethylamine hydrochloride, and N,N-diisopropylethylamine were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich.
1-Hydroxybenzotriazole, l-alanine, d-alanine, rac-alanine, l-phenylalanine, and l-isoleucine
were obtained from Spectrochem Pvt. Ltd. (Mumbai, India). All other
reagents and solvents were of reagent grade and used without further
purification.

NMR Spectroscopy, Mass Spectrometry (MS),
and Elemental Analysis
1H and 13C NMR
spectra were recorded on a
Bruker AV-400 spectrometer, with chemical shifts reported as ppm (in
dimethylsulfoxide-d6 with tetramethylsilane
as the internal standard). Mass spectra were obtained from a Shimadzu
2020 LC-MS spectrometer. Elemental analysis was carried out on a ThermoScientific
FLASH 2000 Organic Element Analyzer.

Absorption Spectroscopy
UV–vis spectra were
recorded on a Cary 5000 UV–vis–NIR spectrophotometer
(Agilent Technologies). Solutions of the samples of appropriate concentrations
were analyzed in a quartz cuvette of 1 mm path length.

CD Spectroscopy
CD measurements were carried out on
a Jasco J-815 spectropolarimeter in a nitrogen atmosphere. The sensitivity,
time constant, and scan rate were chosen appropriately. Solutions
of the samples of appropriate concentrations were analyzed in a quartz
cuvette of 1 mm path length. Temperature-dependent measurements were
performed using a Peltier-type temperature controller (CDF-4265/15)
in the range of 20–90 °C, with a ramp rate of 1–3
°C min–1. For temperature-dependent studies,
once the molecular self-assembly of the triad (except State I of LL and DD) reached its saturation (maximum CD
amplitude), it was subjected to heating with a specific ramp rate
until it reached 90 °C, which was then maintained for 5 min at
90 °C and successively cooled at the same ramp rate to 20 °C.
In the case of State I of LL and DD, their
solution in NMP was directly used for the temperature-dependent studies,
as described above.

Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy
FESEM images
were acquired using an FEI Nova nanoSEM-600 equipped with a field
emission gun operating at 5–10 kV. The samples were prepared
by drop-casting 200 μM solutions onto a Si(111) substrate.

Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM)
TEM images were
acquired using a JEOL, JEM 3010 instrument operating at 300 kV. The
samples were prepared by drop-casting 200 μM solutions on a
200-mesh holey carbon-supported copper grid.

Self-Assembly Protocol
for the Triads
An appropriate
volume of the triad was transferred from a freshly prepared 2 mM stock
solution in NMP to a sample vial. The triad was then diluted with
NMP to a required concentration. The diluted triad was then added
to an appropriate volume of water using an Eppendorf micropipette
to induce self-assembly under the influence of hydrophobic force.
Given the kinetic nature of the self-assembly, the molecular aggregation
was dependent on temperature, mechanical agitation, and freshness
of the triad stock solution. Thus, the samples were prepared from
fresh stock solutions, and the measurements were carried out at 20–25
°C unless otherwise mentioned. To maintain uniformity, the aqueous
solution of the triad upon addition of water was gently mixed using
the Eppendorf micropipette itself and no vigorous mixing/agitation
or sonication was employed. The mixing was done by drawing up and
dispensing the solution of the triad in the sample vial thrice using
the Eppendorf micropipette. The resulting triad in aqueous NMP was
then used for further studies. For the majority-rules and sergeants-and-soldiers
experiments, the triads taken from the respective stock solutions
were mixed in a vial, which was then diluted with NMP. The mixture
of triads in NMP was then added to water, and a similar procedure
was followed as described above.

Kinetic Analysis
The kinetic traces of the triads were
fitted to two-step (single-autocatalytic) and four-step (double-autocatalytic)
models that are respectively known in the literature as the Finke–Watzky
two-step model and four-step double-autocatalytic model.59,60 We employed MATLAB to deduce the rate constants k1, k2, k3, and k4. Starting with an initial
estimate, fminsearch was used to find the minimum
values because it offers an unconstrained nonlinear optimization for
a multivariable function. Given the stiffness of the mathematical
problem, thousands of data points, and several orders of magnitude
of the solution values (computationally obtained range 10–12–103), ordinary differential equation (ODE) solver ode15s was used to minimize the computation cost as well
as to speed up the computational analysis. Additionally, absolute
tolerance (AbsTol) and relative tolerance (RelTol) were both set at 1 × 10–06.

The two-step and four-step mechanisms are as follows

A—Monomer or kinetically trapped state

B—Aggregated
nucleus

C—Higher-order aggregate

k1—Rate constant for nucleation

k2/k3/k4—Rate constant for growth

t—Time

was fitted using the following equation  

The four-step
mechanism was fitted using the following equations      

Conclusions
In conclusion, we showed
that the three-component modular system
comprising biomolecules (amino acid) and functional molecules (NDI
and pyrene) is an effective strategy to tailor molecular self-assembly
and to emulate biological systems. By modulating the solvophobic interactions,
the triads LL and DD were self-assembled
into three different aggregation states, namely, State I, State II,
and State III. A sequential transition involving all three different
aggregation states of DD that occurred over a timescale
of a few minutes is the most-striking dynamic pathway complexity ever
observed in a molecularly self-assembled system. Remarkably, emergent
behaviors such as supramolecular speciation, supramolecular regulation,
and super-nonlinearity have been presented for the first time in a
synthetic system. By employing various experiments and techniques,
the mechanisms involved during the supramolecular speciation, super-nonlinearity,
supramolecular regulation, and chiral denaturation were delineated,
which illustrate the effects occurring at the molecular, supramolecular,
and microscopic levels. Such efforts are likely to offer novel insights
into protein (mis)folding, biochemical signaling, autoregulatory mechanisms,
and several other biochemical processes. This report is expected to
inspire novel designs to construct complex lifelike emergent ensembles
via systems chemistry and/or synthetic biology approaches in the near
future.
