Graphene is a single
layer of carbon atoms with a large surface-to-volume
ratio, providing a large capacity gas molecule adsorption and a strong
surface sensitivity. Chemical vapor deposition-grown graphene-based
NO2 gas sensors typically have detection limits from 100
parts per billion (ppb) to a few parts per million (ppm), with response
times over 1000 s. Numerous methods have been proposed to enhance
the NO2 sensing ability of graphenes. Among them, surface
decoration with metal particles and metal-oxide particles has demonstrated
the potential to enhance the gas-sensing properties. Here, we show
that the NO2 sensing of graphene can be also enhanced via
decoration with monodisperse polymer beads. In dark conditions, the
detection limit is improved from 1000 to 45 ppb after the application
of polystyrene (PS) beads. With laser illumination, a detection limit
of 0.5 ppb is determined. The enhanced gas sensing is due to surface
plasmon polaritons excited by interference and charge transfer between
the PS beads. This method opens an interesting route for the application
of graphene in gas sensing.

1 Introduction
Toxic
gases such as NH3, CO, NO2, and SO2, which are largely derived from factories and vehicles, can
inflict great long-term harm on the environment and human health.1 Among these gases, nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is one of the most hazardous, which can cause damage to the lungs,
cardiovascular system, and upper respiratory tract when as little
53 parts per billion (ppb) NO2 is inhaled.2,3 Therefore, it is essential to develop high-performance gas sensors
with ultra-sensitive properties to monitor the concentration of NO2 for both the environment and human health. There is a profusion
of research on metal oxides,4−9 conducting polymers,10 and related heterojunctions,
etc.11 However, gas sensors based on metal
oxides have several drawbacks, such as low sensitivity at room temperature
(RT), poor selectivity, high power consumption, and complex synthesis
techniques, which limit their application for NO2 detection.12,13 Furthermore, in spite of their RT operation and ease of processing,
the effects of humidity and degradation limit the application of conducting
polymers for gas sensing.14

Graphene
is a honeycomb-like two-dimensional monoatomic layer with
many excellent properties.15,16 Over the past years,
graphene has received ever more attention for applications in gas
sensing17 because of its large surface
area (2630 m2/g) and extraordinarily high charge carrier
mobility (15 000 cm2 V–1 s–1) at RT.18 The superiority
of graphene for gas sensing relies on two basic factors associated
with its 2 dimensional nature, that is, the ultrahigh surface area
per atom and high electron transport along the graphene base-plane.19 A wide range of chemicals, biomolecules, and
gas/vapors have been detected using graphene-based sensors.20−22 It is reported that chemical vapor deposition (CVD)-grown graphene
has a detection limit (DL) of 100 ppb with an absorption time of 1000
s.20 A graphene-based field-effect transistor
gas sensor has been reported to have a sensitivity of 2.5 ppm.23 Multilayer graphene has been shown to have a
DL of 1 ppm ppb with an absorption time of 1800 s.24 Several methods have been proposed to enhance the NO2 sensing capability of graphene by improving the interactions
between graphene and the NO2 molecules, such as ozone-treatment25 and the introduction of defects and dopants.26 Decorating graphene with metal,27,28 metal oxide nano-particles,29−31 and polymers32−34 has proved
to be a potential approach for enhancing its gas sensing properties.
These graphene hybrids with modulated electronic properties enhance
the selectivity and sensitivity. Polystyrene (PS) beads are micrometer-sized
monodisperse polymer particles. It was reported recently that by introducing
PS beads on graphene, surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) waves are
excited in the graphene through diffraction of the light, which significantly
enhances the interaction between the graphene and molecules.35

In this work, PS beads were drop-coated
onto the surface of graphene.
We found that the charge transfer between PS beads and graphene and
the excited SPP waves through diffraction of light by the PS beads
significantly enhance the NO2 sensing. A clear response
is measured for 45 ppb NO2 after PS bead decorating in
dark conditions. With the illumination of a laser, an ultra-high DL
of 0.5 ppb is achieved. Moreover, several localized domains are mapped
under the microscope to investigate the impact the arrangement of
the PS beads on the graphene. Our results indicate that when the graphene
is decorated by submonolayer, PS bead enhancement increases with PS
bead coverage density but the response decreases with increasing layer
thickness. This research may open an interesting window for the study
graphene-based gas sensors.

2 Results and Discussion
Graphene was synthesized on Cu foil via CVD.36 To synthesize the large-scale continuous monolayer graphene,
Cu foil was folded into a pocket after Ar plasma treatment (Figure 1a). To further remove
surface oxidization and contamination, the Cu pocket was annealed
at 1035 °C for 40 min with a hydrogen flow rate of 10 sccm prior
to growth. The graphene growth was carried out at 1035 °C for
40 min under a methane and a hydrogen flow. Details of the growth
can be found elsewhere.35 After synthesis,
the external surface of the pocket was etched by oxygen plasma. As
shown in Figure 1b,
the inner surface of the pocket was coated with polymethylmethacrylate
(PMMA) to form a stamp during transfer. The copper was etched away
by soaking in ammonium persulfate solution for 6 h (Figure 1c). The floating PMMA/graphene
stack was soaked in deionized water for 30 min, and then transferred
onto a Si wafer with 300 nm SiO2 (Figure 1d). The PMMA was then dissolved using acetone
(Figure 1f). Silver
wires were used as electrodes for gas sensing.

Figure S1a shows the optical image
of
the graphene after transfer. No clear residue is observed. The quality
of the graphene after transfer was further characterized with Raman
spectroscopy. Figure S1b shows the Raman
spectra of the graphene on a SiO2 substrate using an excitation
wavelength of 532 nm. A strong G band located at 1591 cm–1 and a sharp and symmetric 2D band at 2684.5 cm–1 are present. The sharpness of the peaks and the intensity ratio
(2:1) of 2D to G Raman bands indicate that the graphene is monolayer
in nature and of high quality.37 PS beads
were deposited onto the graphene surface by a drop-coating method
using a pipette, as shown in Figure 2a. Before drop-coating, PS beads were diluted with
a mixture of alcohol and water. Figure 2b,c shows typical scanning electron microscopy (SEM)
and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images, respectively, for
PS beads on a graphene surface. The PS beads have a uniform diameter
of ∼1 μm and the coverage of PS beads can have various
configurations, that is, areas without PS beads, with few PS beads,
with a monolayer PS beads, and with multilayers PS beads. X-ray photoemission
spectroscopy (XPS) was further used to investigate the decoration
of PS beads on the graphene. Figure 2d shows XPS compositional analysis of the bare graphene
and the graphene decorated with PS beads. For the graphene on a SiO2 substrate, the binding energy for C 1s is 284.33 eV. However,
for the graphene decorated with PS beads, because of a significant
charge transfer between the graphene and PS beads, the C 1s peak moves
to 284.82 eV. It also indicates that the graphene surface is truly
decorated with PS beads.

The dynamic-sensing response
of the graphene sensor was investigated
by detecting NO2 in dry air at RT. A constant source–drain
bias of 1 V was applied to the sensor and the electrical resistance
change of the device upon exposure to NO2 was monitored
and recorded as the sensing signal. Figure 3a shows the dynamic-sensing response of a
graphene sensor before the drop-coating of the PS beads. The concentration
of NO2 varies from 45 to 100 000 ppb. There is a
clear signal starting at 1 ppm with a sensitivity of 2%. The sensitivity
(S) is defined as, S = ΔR/R0 × 100%, where ΔR = R – R0, R0 and R are the electrical
resistances of the sensor in air before a sensing cycle and the target
gas, respectively. The resistance of the sensor decreases with increasing
NO2 concentration, indicating the p-type characteristics
of the graphene and NO2 working as an electron acceptor.
When NO2 is adsorbed onto the surface of graphene, electrons
will be transferred from the graphene to the NO2 molecules,
which increases the hole concentration in the graphene and thus decreases
the resistance. Figure 3b shows the dynamic-sensing response of the graphene sensor measured
in dark conditions after PS bead drop-coating. Magnified gas sensing
dynamics under each gas concentration is shown in Figure S2. Note, the sensor was pumped in vacuum for half
an hour to aid the removal of molecules adsorbed on the surface. The
resistance decreases by around 10% when the graphene is decorated
with PS beads, indicating that a significant portion of electrons
have been transferred from the graphene to the PS beads at the interface
between the graphene and PS beads. This is consistent with the XPS
characterization (Figure 2d). Remarkably, a signal from 45 ppb with a sensitivity of
0.8% is clearly observed. The NO2-sensing performance of
the graphene can be further enhanced by photo-illumination. The dynamic-sensing
response of the PS bead-coated graphene sensor measured under 635
nm photo-illumination is plotted in Figure S3. A sensitivity of 2% was achieved when the device was exposed to
45 ppb NO2 under 635 nm photo-illumination, which is around
a 2.5 times performance enhancement compared to that without photo-illumination.
Similar enhancement behavior was observed for other wavelengths. Figure 3c summarized the
sensing responses of the graphene sensor to 45 ppb NO2 under
various conditions. One can see that no response is detected for sensors
based on the pristine graphene in darkness. After decoration with
PS beads, a sensitivity of 0.45% is achieved in the dark, and this
can be further enhanced to 1% under 1064 nm photo-illumination. Thus,
PS bead decoration significantly enhances the NO2 sensing
of graphene. A very low DL of 45 ppb is achieved with little noise,
providing scope for further improvement. Extrapolating, the ideal
DL is around 0.5 ppb, which is calculated by considering the noise
and the slope of the sensitivity versus concentration.38 The excellent sensing response is competitive
when compared with most other high-performance NO2 gas
sensors. For example, the single-layered graphene has a DL of 2.5
ppm at RT.23 Cu-modified carbon spheres/reduced
graphene oxide has a DL of 10 ppm at RT.39 The lower DL of voltage-activated reduced graphene oxide is around
50 ppb,40 for further comparison, the DLs
of more graphene-based NO2 gas sensors are summarized in Table 1.

The long-term stability and repeatability of the sensor is very
important for its application.41Figure 3d shows the dynamic-sensing
responses of the same sensor under 1064 nm laser illumination measured
as fabricated and after 4 month air exposure. The sensor still works
properly after 4 month air exposure but with a sensitivity reduced
by 25%. The reduced sensitivity is mainly due to the adsorption of
other gas molecules when exposed to air. In addition, multicycle dynamic
sensing responses were used to demonstrate the stability of the sensor
(Figure S4). It can be seen that our sensor
fully saturated in 8 h and the sensitivity of the sensor has a fluctuation
of 0.12% for 8800 ppb NO2. Figure 3e shows the effect of humidity on the sensing
response of the gas sensor. The response increases with increasing
humidity, suggesting that the presence of water does not degrade performance
but that the humidity must be monitored concurrently for real applications.
For the application of a sensor in a real environment, selectivity,
the ability to discriminate the target gas of interest in the presence
of other gases, is also very important. To investigate this, a graphene
sensor decorated with PS beads was exposed to a variety of gases at
a concentration of 1 ppm, including NO2, H2S,
NH3, and CO. Figure 3f summarizes the responses to these gases. The sensitivity
is around 3% when exposed to 1 ppm NO2. While when exposed
to 1 ppm H2S, the sensitivity is less than 0.2% and no
response was detected for 1 ppm CO or NH3. Thus, the sensors
showed a lower response to these possibly interfering gases relative
to the NO2.

To further investigate the effect of
PS beads on the NO2-sensing capability of the graphene
under photo-illumination, we
fabricated a single sensor with four different PS distribution densities
(Figure 4a). Figure 4b shows representative
SEM images for four distinct areas, that is, an area without PS (area
1), with few PS beads (area 2), with monolayer PS beads (area 3),
and with multilayers PS beads (area 4). A low-magnification SEM image
of the areas in Figure 4b is shown in Figure S5, and the areas
1–4 with different PS bead distributions are clearly marked. Figure S6 is a typical photographic image of
one of our devices. The dynamic-sensing response of the graphene sensor
was investigated by locally illuminating each of the four areas with
1064 nm laser under a microscope. In other words, the resistance of
the overall device was determined for local illumination in each of
the four areas. For example, to investigate the effect of the PS beads
in area 2 under photo illumination we focused the laser beam to the
area 2. The diameter of the laser spot was around 10 μm. Figure 4c shows the dynamic-sensing
response of the graphene sensor when locally illuminated in those
four areas. For comparison, the dynamic-sensing response of the unilluminated
sensor is plotted as well, and it is clear that photo-illumination
can enhance gas-sensing response (Figure 4d). In addition, the enhancement increases
with PS bead coverage density but decreases with increasing layer
thickness. In area 4, the multilayer of PS beads is too thick for
the laser to efficiently penetrate, resulting in a decrease in sensitivity.
We also fitted the adsorption sections of the response curve with
the expression y = y0 + A ex/τA, where τA is the adsorption time (response
time). Figure S7 shows the adsorption time
changes with the concentration of PS beads. The adsorption time τA decreases with PS bead density but increases with increasing
layer thickness. To further investigate the effect of PS bead coverage
density, we fabricated four sensors with four different densities. Figure S8 shows the dynamic-sensing response
of four graphene sensors with different PS concentrations measured
in dark against 250 ppb NO2. Again, it is found that the
enhancement also increases with PS bead coverage density but decreases
with increasing layer thickness. For multilayers of PS beads, NO2 molecules will prefer to adsorb on the top PS beads covering
the graphene, which decreases the charge transfer between graphene
and bottom PS beads. Thus, resulting in the decrease in sensitivity.

The scale bar is 2 μm. (c) Dynamic-sensing response in dark
and with four areas of localized 1064 nm light illumination (d) and
corresponding sensitivity.

There are four main ways to enhance the gas sensitivity of
the
graphene and increase the interaction between the gas molecules and
graphene: (1) changes in conductance of the graphene by redistribution
of electrons; (2) providing electrons or holes to change the carrier
concentration of the graphene; (3) covalent bond formation between
the gas molecules and graphene;42 and (4)
extra surface area within concave regions between the graphene and
PS beads. Figure 5 shows
a schematic drawing of the charge transfer and electron distribution
of graphene/PS bead hybrids under photo-illumination. It has been
shown in finite difference time domain simulations that the maximum
field enhancement factor (E2/Einc2) is around 2.25 in the graphene/PS bead
hybrid, where Einc is the incident electric
field of the incident light and E is the total local
electric field in the presence of the PS particle.35 The calculated maximum field enhancement factor is slight
smaller than the measured gas-sensing enhancement factor of 2.5 under
photo-illumination. The simulations also show that localized oscillations
appear in the graphene emanating from the contact point. The SPP wave
propagation along the graphene layer will also contribute the gas-sensing
enhancement. To confirm the presence of the SPP wave in the graphene,
the Raman spectra of the four positions marked in Figure 4b were investigated (Figure 5b). Several new peaks
appear apart from the strong G band and the symmetric 2D band of graphene,
which correspond to the Raman modes of isotactic and atactic PS beads.43 Note, area 1 does not contain any PS beads and
should not have PS-related peaks. However, areas 1–4 are all
on the same sample as shown in Figure S5. Thus, when the Raman laser is focused on area 1, it is possible
for light to scatter onto nearby PS beads producing a stray signal,
thus the spectra of area 1 will include weak PS peaks. Interestingly,
the intensity of the G band does not change significantly with the
introduction of PS beads, indicating PS bead decoration will not change
the quality of the graphene. In contrast, the 2D band is significantly
enhanced with PS bead decoration. An enhancement factor of 2 is achieved
at position 3. With increasing the layer thickness, the enhancement
factor decreases which is consistent with the gas-sensing measurements.
It is known that the 2D band in the graphene reflects the electron
distribution and doping in the graphene.44 The enhanced 2D band suggests that PS bead decoration excites SPP
waves and the propagation of SPP waves redistribute electrons in the
graphene, which enhances the gas-sensing performance.

Figure 5 (a) Schematic drawing
of charge transfer and electron distribution
of graphene/PS bead hybrids under photo illumination. (b) Raman spectra
of the same four positions marked in Figure 3a. (c) Schematic drawing of the electric
potential and static forces when a NO2 molecular absorb
on the graphene with PS beads in darkness or (d) with localized light
illumination.

Moreover, in a typical
semiconductor photocatalytic reaction an
electron is excited from the valence band (VB) of the semiconductor
into its conduction band (CB) under the irradiation of a laser. In
graphene/PS bead hybrids, the photo-excited electrons and holes can
transfer to the graphene, which may strengthen the response of the
sensor. However, the PS beads typically have a bandgap width of over
4 eV. Thus, the photons of the laser (wavelength of 635 nm) in our
experiments are unable to excite electrons from the VB to CB. Figure S9 shows the electric field potentials
of a NO2 molecule in air, on the top of graphene, and near
the graphene/PS beads interface. The simulated electric field is pointed
from PS beads to the graphene, confirming transfer of electrons from
the graphene to the PS beads, which is consistent with experimental
observations. In dark conditions, when a NO2 molecule is
near the concave region between the graphene and PS sphere, there
are two competing static forces that will drag the NO2 molecule
into the concave shadow regions (Figure 5c). One of the static forces is from the
graphene surface and the other is from the PS. Thus, more NO2 molecules will be aggregated within this concave region and cause
a sensitivity increase. After being illuminated with localized light,
more electrons will transfer from the graphene to the PS beads and
this will result in a small dipole layer appearing in the contact
region of the PS spheres and graphene. Thus, NO2 molecules
will be attracted into the concave regions through the dipolar interaction
between the dipole layer and NO2 polar molecules (Figure 5d). This dipolar
interaction depends on the dipole layer strength, and should be higher
than the induced static interactions in the dark conditions, which
further enhances the sensitivity and results in faster adsorption.

3 Conclusions
To conclude, we have proposed and demonstrated
a simple and cheap
method to enhance the NO2-sensing performance of the graphene.
An ultra-low DL of 0.5 ppb was determined. The enhanced gas sensing
is due to the SPPs excited in the graphene and the charge transfer
between the PS beads and graphene. Our results open an interesting
route for the application of the graphene in gas sensing.
