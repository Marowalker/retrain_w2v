We describe the design
and optimization of polyfunctional scaffolds
based on a fluorescent indolizine core derivatized with various orthogonal
groups (amines, esters, oximes, alkynes, etc.). To show one application
as tools in biology, the scaffold was used to prepare drug–biotin
conjugates that were then immobilized onto avidin-agarose for affinity
chromatography. More specifically, the antiangiogenic drug COB223,
whose mechanism of action remained unclear, was chosen as a proof-of-concept
drug. The drug-selective discrimination of proteins observed after
elution of the cell lysates through the affinity columns, functionalized
either with the biologically active COB223 or a structurally related
inactive analogue (COB236), is a clear indication that the presence
of the indolizine core does not limit drug–protein interaction
and confirms the usefulness of the indolizine scaffold. Furthermore,
the separation of COB223-interacting proteins from human placental
extracts unveiled unanticipated protein targets belonging to the family
of regulatory RNA-binding proteins, which opens the way to new hypotheses
on the mode of action of this antiangiogenic drug.

Introduction
During the last decades,
the development of orthogonal chemistries1,2 opened
the way to the conception of molecular scaffolds decorated
with orthogonal reactive groups (azide, alkyne, alkene, carbonyl,
etc.) and their use for bioconjugations.3−7 So far, there are a few heterocyclic platforms,8−10 and none with
intrinsic luminescent properties. In a previous work, we considered
the use of pyridinium ylide-alkyne cycloaddition forming indolizine
as fluorogenic coupling methodology.11 Indeed,
bioactive indolizines are well-known (for a recent review on their
chemical synthesis and biological evaluation, see Singh and Mmatli12), but new applications have emerged in the fields
of fluorescent markers in biology,13−15 detection of organic
compounds,16,17 or material sciences.18 Among the different synthetic strategies, we
selected the two-step preparation of 1,3,7-trisubstituted indolizines
(illustrated in Scheme 1) from easily accessible reactants (pyridine, alkylating agent, and
propiolic ester or amide) and simple reaction conditions. The three
partners of the reaction were thus optimized, and in particular, the
study pointed to the importance of the electron-withdrawing character
of the R1 group.

Scheme 1 Two-Step Synthesis of Indolizines11
With these results in hand and to go further toward biochemical
or biological applications, we decided to exploit the pre- and postfunctionalizations
of these 1,3,7-trisubstituted indolizines in an effort to design versatile
multipodal scaffolds containing various orthogonal groups. As a proof
of interest, the methodology was next applied to the synthesis of
biotin–drug conjugates, very useful reactants for affinity
chromatography. As a matter of fact, we recently described19 the synthesis and biological evaluation of a
series of antiangiogenic molecules whose leader compound (COB223)
is shown in Figure 1 along with the inactive analogue COB236. COB223 inhibits the vascular
endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling pathway downstream of Ras
and upstream of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2)
phosphorylation; however, we were unable to pinpoint its exact molecular
target.

Figure 1 Antiangiogenic agents19 and their biotin-tagged
analogues.

To go further into the identification
of the intracellular target
of COB223, we decided to perform the affinity chromatography of placental
extracts (placenta is the most highly vascularized tissue in human
body and is easily accessible) on a COB223-modified agarose gel column.
To do so, we needed a biotinylated derivative of COB223 for immobilization
onto avidin-agarose columns. However, it turned out that modifying
COB223 was not so straightforward due to the presence of several nucleophilic
centers and to its high polarity that complicated isolation and purification.
Designing an original synthetic procedure for biotin-tagged drugs
based on the indolizine scaffold was an appealing option.

We
report here the chemistry of 7-acetyl- and 7-carboxamidoindolizines
as potential multifunctional platforms. Various orthogonal groups
(esters, amines, alkoxyamines, alkynes) were introduced at positions
1, 3, and 7 of the indolizine rings, by either pre- or postfunctionalization
to illustrate the variety of reactions that may be performed. The
most suitable methodology was applied to the synthesis of two biotin-tagged
antiangiogenic drugs. To evaluate the possible impact of the indolizine
nucleus on drug–protein interaction, the biotin-tagged molecules
were immobilized onto streptavidin agarose beads and used for affinity
chromatography and subsequent proteomics analysis. The comparison
of the data obtained using either the biologically active drug (COB223)
or the inactive analogue (COB236) is discussed.

Results and Discussion
The indolizines shown in Scheme 1 contain three points of modification, each of them
coming from one of the three reactants: R1 from the pyridine,
R2 from the alkylating agent (halogeno acetic ester or
amide), and R3 from the activated alkyne (propiolic ester
or amide). Two strategies were envisioned for the introduction of
functional groups: either before cyclization (prefunctionalization)
by synthesizing modified starting reactants, or after cyclization
(more versatile postfunctionalization). Choosing between the two approaches
would mainly be dependent on the stability and orthogonality of the
different functions, and on the efficiency of isolation and purification.

7-Acetyl Indolizine 3 was first evaluated as a potential
tripodal scaffold (Scheme 2A) with methyl ester and two “clickable” functions
(alkyne and carbonyl) for further postfunctionalization. The triple
bond may either be introduced using the propiolic amide 2 as dipolarophile20 or via formation of
the reactive para-nitrophenyl ester 5(21) followed by substitution with propargylamine.
Next, the reaction with alkoxyamines (illustrated by benzyloxyamine)
yielded the corresponding oxime 4.

Scheme 2 Different Strategies
of Formation and Modulation of Tripodal Core.
Amine Containing Reactants were Introduced at Positions 1 (Part A),
3 (Part B) or 7 (Part C) of the Indolizine Ring
In this first example, the amino group (i.e.,
propargylamine) was
introduced at position 1 of the indolizine ring; however, it was also
valuable to link amino groups to other positions. Indolizines 8, 9, and 12 contain the amino groups
(illustrated by propylamine, see Scheme 2B) at position 3. To do so, the corresponding
2-bromo-N-propylacetamide was used as alkylating
agent in the preparation of the pyridinium salt (7 or 11).11 Two strategies were then
evaluated. To form the indolizine 8, the rather stable
ethyl ester was introduced at position 1 by reacting ethyl propiolate
with 7. The oxime bond was later formed to give 9. In the case of indolizine 12 bearing reactive para-nitrophenyl ester, the oxime bond was formed in excellent
yield at an earlier stage, i.e., before alkylation with the 2-bromo-N-propylacetamide and cyclization with the para-nitrophenyl propiolate 5. Lastly, the amino group (exemplified
by the mono-Boc-protected 2,2′-(ethylendioxy)bis(ethylamine),
often used as linker in the synthesis of bioconjugates), was introduced
at position 7 of the indolizine ring. As drawn in Scheme 2C, isonicotinic amide 14 was prepared from the activated ester 13(22) and mono-Boc-protected 2,2′-(ethylendioxy)bis(ethylamine).
Alkylation with the ethyl 2-bromoacetate gave the pyridinium salt 15a. To highlight the high reactivity of ester at position
1 of pyridinium salts, due to the presence of the positive charge
at β-position, a transesterification was realized in CD3OD at room temperature (rt) with the formation of the deuterated
analogue 15b. The deuterated indolizine 16 was then obtained by cyclization of 15b with the reactive
propiolate 5 as described above. We thus formed a reactive
scaffold containing two esters of different stabilities, and a Boc-protected
amine that can easily be released by trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) treatment.

The latter approach was chosen to prepare the two biotin-tagged
COB223 and COB236. Indeed, direct binding of biotin to the molecule
was precluded due to limited access of the drug by the target protein
during affinity chromatography, and to overcome this problem, ethylene
glycol (EG) linker such as in Biot-NH-EG-NH2 (Scheme 3) was added. The
site of functionalization of the active drug by the biotin was another
key point to examine. As reported earlier,19 the structure–activity relationships pointed to the importance
of both the dansyl chromophore and the polyamine linker for the antiangiogenic
properties. We therefore chose to modify the Boc group of COB223 and
COB236. As depicted in Scheme 3, the drugs were introduced at the last step to limit tedious
purification steps. The key intermediate, Biot-NH-EG-NH-Py 18, was prepared from Biot-NH-EG-NH21723 by reaction with the reactive para-nitrophenyl isonicotinic ester 13. Alkylation with
methyl 2-bromoacetate in acetone gave the corresponding pyridinium
bromide 19 in excellent yield. This intermediate was
stable at room temperature for extended period of time. Cyclization
with para-nitrophenyl propiolate 5 in
dimethylformamide (DMF) in the presence of K2CO3 gave the indolizine 20 in reasonable yield. Due to
the reactivity of the para-nitrophenyl ester, the
next step was performed without further purification. The nucleophilic
substitution by the primary amines of 21a,b, issued from
the Boc deprotection of COB223 or COB236, yielded the corresponding
biotin-tagged molecules.

Scheme 3 Synthetic Pathway for the Biotin-Tagged
Compounds
COB223-biotin and
COB236-biotin were then immobilized onto streptavidin
agarose beads. We had observed during the synthesis that COB223-biotin
and COB236-biotin were very stable in organic solvents, and to test
the stability in aqueous solutions, the samples of the modified gels
were suspended in a pH 7.5 buffer that was then used for affinity
chromatography. The suspensions were shaken several days at various
temperatures (40–70 °C). Thanks to the fluorescence properties
of the indolizine core, the gels and supernatants obtained after centrifugation
were easily analyzed under UV–vis irradiation. The gels remained
highly fluorescent, and no detectable trace of fluorescent molecules
was observed in the supernatants (see Figure S1), confirming the stability of COB–biotin–streptavidin
columns in conditions much harsher than those routinely used in biology.

As COB223 was previously shown to be antiangiogenic, whereas the
structurally related COB236 was inactive in angiogenesis assays, we
selected a highly vascularized tissue, the placenta, as a source of
target proteins. Affinity purifications of COB-binding proteins were
then performed by loading 400 mg of placental extract proteins (in
Tris 20 mM-HCl pH 7.5, NaCl 75 mM, Triton X-100 0.05%) onto each column.
Experiments were performed at 4 °C in the presence of protease
inhibitors (Sigma) to prevent any degradation not only of the proteins
but also of the drug–biotin conjugates. The columns were washed
with 5 volumes of Tris 20 mM-HCl pH 7.5 and then eluted successively
with 3 column volumes of Tris 20 mM-HCl pH 7.5 0.2 M NaCl and then
with 3 column volumes of Tris 20 mM-HCl pH 7.5, 0.5 M NaCl. The 0.5
M NaCl eluates of each column were concentrated by sodium dodecyl
sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) in stacking
polyacrylamide gels, which were then trypsinized and the released
peptides were analyzed by liquid chromatography–tandem mass
spectrometry (LC–MS/MS). This allowed us to identify 40 proteins
that were significantly more abundant in COB223-agarose eluates than
in COB236-agarose eluates (Table S1). Although
we previously reported that COB223 inhibits VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2)
activation of ERK1/2 phosphorylation in microvascular endothelial
cells,19 none of these COB223-binding proteins
was a known intermediate of the VEGF signaling pathway. Then, using
the DAVID Bioinformatics Resource (v 6.8; NIAID, NIH), we searched
to which pathway these proteins belonged in majority. It appeared
that 13 out of 38 members (2 out of 40 were not referenced in DAVID)
of this protein cluster (listed in Table 1) were annotated as poly(A) RNA-binding proteins,
corresponding to a 4.7-fold enrichment (p value =
1.9 × 10–5 corresponding to 2.0 × 10–3 after Benjamini–Hochberg correction for multiple
testing).24,25 The procedure, called gene ontology enrichment,
searches for biological functions, processes, and localizations that
are over-represented in the 38 “hit proteins” as compared
to a random selection of 38 proteins among translated sequences from
the whole human genome.26

Such a low p value
indicates a significant enrichment
of poly(A) RNA-binding proteins among the proteins binding specifically
to COB223. These included two ribosomal proteins (S14, S20) and several
proteins known to regulate RNA translation, splicing, or stability
through tight protein–RNA interactions. We thus speculate that
COB223 might interfere with the RNA-processing machinery and thereby
modify the level of expression of essential components of the VEGF
signaling pathway. The most differentially retained RNA-binding protein,
PA2G4, is of great interest, as it is also known as ErbB3-binding
protein (EBP1). EBP1 has been implicated in growth inhibition and
the induction of differentiation of human cancer cells.27,28 Whether it can also interact with VEGF receptors and the VEGF signaling
pathway will be worth testing in the future.

Conclusions
As
a conclusion, we have developed the chemistry of 1,3,7-trifunctionalized
indolizines toward their uses as di- or tripodal scaffolds. This approach
has several advantages, and in particular commercially or easily accessible
reactants and mild reaction conditions. Various functional groups
(esters, amines, alkynes, oxyamines, carbonyls, etc.) were successfully
introduced on the scaffold by combining pre- or postfunctionalization
reactions, ensuring the versatility of this platform. Another interesting
aspect is linked to the intrinsic fluorescence of the indolizine ring16,17,29,30 that allows the easy monitoring of the molecules not only during
synthesis, but also in the course of biochemical and biological assays.
In the present work, fluorescence properties were applied to assess
the stability of biotin-tagged molecules.

To illustrate a first
application as a tool in molecular biology,
we created a new biotin-modified scaffold convenient to prepare biotin-tagged
drugs for cellular targets identification using proteomics analysis.31 The biotin-derived indolizine 20 was synthesized in two steps, and was used as the key reactant to
label amine-containing molecules. As proof of concept, the antiangiogenic
COB223 drug and the inactive COB236 analogue were studied. The drug-selective
discrimination of proteins observed after elution of the cell lysates
through the affinity columns, functionalized either with the active
(COB223) drug or its structurally related inactive (COB236) analogue,
is a clear indication that the presence of the indolizine core does
not limit the drug–protein interaction, thus confirming the
usefulness of the new biotin–indolizine reagent for drug tagging.

Very interestingly, affinity purification of COB223-interacting
proteins from human placental extracts allowed us to identify unanticipated
protein targets. None of the primary signaling enzymes that contribute
to the VEGFR2 signaling cascade (VEGF receptor 2, Ras, intracellular
protein-kinases of the ERK, p38 MAP-kinase, and Akt families)32 was present among the affinity-purified proteins.
In contrast, COB223 appeared to interact with several regulatory RNA-binding
proteins, suggesting that it targets indirect mechanisms such as mRNA
editing or mRNA stability, which in turn may affect the level of expression
of some crucial components of the VEGFR2 signaling pathway. Another
possibility is that COB223 acts via binding to PA2G4/EBP1 through
direct interference with the VEGF receptors. These unexpected observations
open the way for a whole set of new biological experiments aimed at
better understanding the mechanism of action of the antiangiogenic
compound COB223, but the exploration of these new hypotheses goes
beyond the scope of the present publication mainly dedicated to the
indolizine chemistry.

From the chemical point of view, we are
now considering other applications
in the fields of surface functionalization and macromolecules modifications.

Biological
Procedures
Affinity Chromatography of COB223/236-Binding Proteins from
Human Placenta
Samples (0.2 mg) of biotinylated-COB223 or
biotinylated-COB236 were separately bound onto two 2 mL columns of
strepavidin-agarose for 20 min at room temperature. The columns were
then equilibrated in Tris 20 mM-HCl buffer pH 7.5. Human placental
tissue was homogenized in Tris 20 mM-HCl buffer pH 7.5 supplemented
with 0.15 M NaCl and 0.1% Triton X-100, and the cytosolic extracts
were prepared by centrifugation at 20 000 g. Fractions of 10
mL of placental cytosolic extracts (containing 35 mg of proteins)
were diluted twice in Tris 20 mM-HCl buffer pH 7.5 and loaded onto
each affinity column, which was then kept at 4 °C. The filtrates
were collected and the columns were sequentially washed with 10 mL
of Tris buffer 0 M NaCl and 6 mL Tris buffer before elution using
0.2 M NaCl, 6 mL Tris buffer, 0.5 M NaCl, and 6 mL Tris buffer and
1 M NaCl. All of the steps were performed at 4 °C in the presence
of protease inhibitors (Sigma). Proteins eluted with 0.2 M NaCl and
0.5 M NaCl were submitted to mass spectrometry-based analyses.

Mass Spectrometry-Based Proteomic Analyses
Protein
preparation and mass spectrometry-based proteomic analyses were realized
as previously described.35 Briefly, extracted
proteins were stacked in the top of a SDS-PAGE gel (NuPAGE 4–12%,
Invitrogen) before in-gel digestion using trypsin (Promega, sequencing
grade). Resulting peptides were analyzed by online nanoLC–MS/MS
(UltiMate 3000 and LTQ-Orbitrap Velos Pro, Thermo Scientific) using
a 120-min gradient. Peptides were identified through concomitant searches
against the Uniprot databank (Homo sapiens taxonomy) and a classical contaminants database (in-house) and the
corresponding reversed databases using Mascot (version 2.5). The Proline
software (http://proline.profiproteomics.fr) was used to filter the results (conservation of rank 1 peptides,
peptide identification FDR <1% as calculated on peptide scores
by employing the reverse database strategy, minimum peptide score
of 25, and minimum of 1 specific peptide per identified protein group)
before performing a compilation, grouping, and comparison of the protein
groups from the COB223 and COB236 samples. Proteins from the contaminants
database and additional keratins were discarded from the final list
of identified proteins. Proteins were considered as enriched in COB223
samples if they were identified only in these samples with a minimum
of three weighted spectral counts or enriched at least five times
in COB223 samples compared to COB236 ones.
