We report a synthetic
approach to form cubic Cu2O/Pd
composite structures and demonstrate their use as photocatalytic materials
for tandem catalysis. Pd nanoparticles were deposited onto Cu2O cubes, and their tandem catalytic reactivity was studied
via the reductive dehalogenation of polychlorinated biphenyls. The
Pd content of the materials was gradually increased to examine its
influence on particle morphology and catalytic performance. Materials
were prepared at different Pd amounts and demonstrated a range of
tandem catalytic reactivity. H2 was generated via photocatalytic
proton reduction initiated by Cu2O, followed by Pd-catalyzed
dehalogenation using in situ generated H2. The results indicate that material morphology and composition and
substrate steric effects play important roles in controlling the overall
reaction rate. Additionally, analysis of the postreacted materials
revealed that a small number of the cubes had become hollow during
the photodechlorination reaction. Such findings offer important insights
regarding photocatalytic active sites and mechanisms, providing a
pathway toward converting light-based energy to chemical energy for
sustainable catalytic reactions not typically driven via light.

Introduction
Given the current global
energy state, a push for rapid access
to sustainable energy, such as solar cells and renewable fuels, has
emerged.1,2 Accordingly, an expansion in research in
the area of photocatalysis has occurred over the past decade.3 Although significant effort has been exerted
to design and fabricate highly active photocatalysts to replace conventional
catalytic materials,4,5 little progress has been made
toward reducing the overall energy, materials, and resources necessary
to create and maintain these light-harvesting systems. As such, existing
catalytic technologies must evolve toward adopting sustainable synthetic
practices that minimize environmental and economic impacts. To this
end, the ability to easily synthesize and characterize functional
nanomaterials with controlled size, shape, composition, and overall
structural morphology will allow us to achieve catalytic technologies
with optimized reactivity.6−8

While photocatalysis is
appealing, it is traditionally limited
to redox chemistries. Thus, the application of photobased approaches
to non-photo-responsive catalytic reactions remains exceedingly rare.9 One approach to address this limitation is to
fabricate multicomponent photocatalytic architectures with multiple
catalytic domains. For this approach, semiconductor materials are
of particular interest because of their photoinduced charge transfer
properties, where fast transfer of charges across the semiconductor
interface is critical for high energy conversion efficiency.10,11 These charge transfer processes can be greatly influenced by the
presence of a noble metal cocatalyst12 coupled
to the semiconductor, which can readily accept photoinduced electrons
to efficiently transfer them to surface adsorbed acceptor molecules
such as to H+ to produce H2.13−15 Additionally,
these metal nanoparticle cocatalysts frequently act as an electron
reservoir and consequently promote charge separation within the semiconductor-metal
assembly.16 Solar H2 production
from photocatalytic water splitting is one of the most notable applications
of photoinduced electron transfer, along with being a promising route
to achieving renewable energy.17 Advancing
toward sustainable chemical processes, photocatalytically generated
H2 could be employed in other catalytic reactions, such
as hydrogenation or hydrodehalogenation, which could also occur at
the metal nanoparticle surface. Use of such a light-promoted tandem
catalytic system has been demonstrated recently.9,18,19 For instance, Hirai and co-workers have
reported the N-monoalkylation of primary amines in alcohol solvents
by tandem photocatalytic and catalytic reactions on TiO2 loaded with Pd particles (Pd/TiO2).19 In separate work, we reported the use of Cu2O cubes with galvanically deposited Pd nanoparticles on the oxide
surface (Cu2O/Pd) as catalysts for the reductive dechlorination
of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), a well-known environmental persistent
organic toxicant present at many contaminated sites around the world.9 For this, photoactivation of the oxide component
results in H2 production, facilitated by Pd, via proton
reduction. This H2 was subsequently activated on the Pd
metal surface from which PCB dechlorination was processed in a tandem-like
fashion. From this, it is clear that semiconductor-metal multicomponent
materials can be tailored to facilitate light-promoted tandem catalysis,
catering to reactions not typically driven via light.

In this
contribution, we demonstrate that the Cu2O/Pd
tandem photocatalytic activity is highly sensitive to both the overall
composite material morphology and the substrate structure for nontraditional
photocatalytic reactions (Scheme 1). To examine the structural effect, Cu2O cubes were generated where varying amounts of Pd nanoparticles
were galvanically deposited on the oxide surface (0–15 wt %).
The materials were extensively characterized to confirm their morphology,
size, composition, and component arrangement using scanning electron
microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), energy-dispersive
X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), inductively coupled plasma optical emission
spectrometry (ICP-OES), and powder X-ray diffraction (XRD). Light-promoted
tandem catalytic activities of the materials were investigated by
monitoring the reductive dechlorination of PCBs. Under light irradiation,
H2 was produced via proton reduction by the Cu2O material facilitated by the Pd nanodomains. Subsequently, the in situ generated H2 was used for Pd-catalyzed
dehalogenation of PCBs. For this, PCB structures that positioned the
Cl substituent at the ortho, meta, and para positions were reductively dechlorinated
to generate the final biphenyl product, and the corresponding reaction
rate constants were quantified. Comparison of the rate constants demonstrated
a general dechlorination reactivity order of para > meta ≥ ortho, with
maximal
catalytic rates obtained using Cu2O/Pd materials with 9
wt % Pd deposited at a composite material catalyst loading of 2 mg/mL.
These findings provide intriguing information concerning the active
sites and composite interface of photocatalytic materials, as well
as
how such structure-defined properties affect the overall reaction
kinetics for photoinitiated tandem systems. They also increase the
understanding of material structural effects over catalytic reactivity,
opening pathways toward new structures with enhanced reactivity or
translation of such photobased approaches to new catalytic processes,
all of which are highly important for environmental remediation of
halogenated organic compounds such as PCBs.

Scheme 1 Reactivity of Cu2O/Pd Composite Structures for Photodriven
Tandem Catalysis
Materials and Methods
Chemicals
CuSO4 and Na2CO3 were obtained from BDH Chemicals; Pd(CH3COO)2 was acquired from Strem Chemicals. HR-GC
hexanes and 200
proof ethanol were attained from EMD Millipore and Pharmco-AAPER,
respectively. Finally, polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP; MW ∼ 29 000
g/mol), sodium citrate, glucose, 2-chlorobiphenyl (PCB 1), 3-chlorobiphenyl
(PCB 2), 4-chlorobiphenyl (PCB 3), and biphenyl were purchased from
Sigma-Aldrich. All chemicals were used as received without further
purification. Milli-Q water (18 MΩ·cm) was used for all
experiments.

Synthesis of Cu2O/Pd Cubes
Cu2O cubes were prepared according to synthetic methods
established
by Sui et al.20 In detail, 3.0 g of PVP
was dissolved in 180 mL of an aqueous 0.038 M CuSO4 solution
with vigorous stirring in a round-bottom flask. Upon complete dissolution
of the PVP, the solution was stirred for an additional 10 min. Next,
40 mL of an aqueous 0.37 M sodium citrate and 0.61 M sodium carbonate
solution mixture was slowly added dropwise with continuous stirring.
This was followed by the addition of 50 mL of an aqueous 1.4 M glucose
solution, which was again slowly added dropwise with continuous stirring.
After complete glucose incorporation, the reaction was stirred for
10 min. The flask was then placed in a 70 °C water bath for 2
h without stirring. Once complete, the dark orange precipitate was
filtered through a 0.2 μm polycarbonate membrane, thoroughly
washed with water and ethanol, and dried under vacuum at 60 °C
for at least 12 h.

The as-synthesized Cu2O cubes
were subsequently coated with Pd nanoparticles via a galvanic exchange
reaction.9 The production of the Cu2O/Pd cubes is described using the deposited Pd mass % to differentiate
the samples. The fabrication of 1 wt % Pd Cu2O/Pd materials
is described below; however, changes to the mass of Pd added were
employed to reach the appropriate metal loading. In a round-bottom
flask, 11.3 mg of Pd(CH3COO)2 was dissolved
by slowly adding 200 proof ethanol until a total volume of 150 mL
was reached with stirring and sonication. Upon complete dissolution
of the Pd(CH3COO)2, 450 mg of the Cu2O material was added to the solution and sonicated until the Cu2O powder was well-dispersed. The solution was stirred for
24 h in the dark as the galvanic exchange reaction proceeded. The
Cu2O/Pd 1 wt % cubes were then filtered, washed with ethanol,
dried under vacuum at 60 °C, and then stored in a vacuum desiccator.

Photocatalytic Reductive Dechlorination of PCBs
For
each photocatalytic experiment, 100 mg of the Cu2O/Pd materials
was added to a 60 mL borosilicate glass vial capped with a Teflon-coated
silicone septum closure. To this, 50 mL of a 50/50 ethanol/water (v/v)
solution of the specific PCB congener at a concentration of 25 μM
was added after being bubbled with N2 for at least 30 min.
This resulted in a catalyst loading of 2 mg/mL. Next, the headspace
of the vial was purged with N2 and the Cu2O/Pd
materials were suspended by sonication. Once the materials were fully
dispersed, the reaction was vigorously stirred while being irradiated
with a 450 W medium pressure Hg-vapor lamp operating at ∼60
mW/cm2, based on the manufacturer’s specifications,
where the sample to light source distance was ∼10 cm. To analyze
the reaction progression, 500 μL aliquots of the reaction mixtures
were taken at predetermined time intervals in at least triplicate
trials. Each aliquot was combined with 500 μL of hexanes in
order to extract the unreacted PCB and the biphenyl product for gas
chromatography (GC) analysis. Separate reactions were also conducted
using the exact same procedures; however, the amount of Cu2O/Pd particles was adjusted to 50 and 150 mg to give 1 and 3 mg/mL
catalyst loadings, respectively. All experiments were conducted under
ambient conditions and at room temperature.

Characterization
SEM was performed using a FEI/Philips
XL-30 field emission SEM equipped with an Advanced Detector Technologies
EDS detector; TEM studies were completed using a JEOL JEM-1400 TEM.
ICP-OES analysis was performed using a Varian Vista-Pro CCD simultaneous
ICP-OES spectrophotometer. Powder XRD analysis was completed on a
Philips MRD X’Pert diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation.
Finally, reaction progression analysis was conducted on an Agilent
7820A GC equipped with a flame ionization detector and on an Agilent
5975C GC-MS. All chromatograms, unless otherwise noted, showed only
the presence of PCB, biphenyl, and hexane.

Results and Discussion
Materials
Synthesis and Characterization
As illustrated
in Scheme 1, to achieve
light-driven PCB degradation, the photocatalytic capability of Cu2O was combined with the hydrodehalogenation activity of Pd
to produce a composite structure for photodriven tandem catalysis.
For this, H2 generation is processed via proton reduction
by Cu2O photoexcitation facilitated by the Pd, followed
by reductive dehalogenation using the in situ generated
H2 at the Pd component. As previously reported, the Cu2O/Pd materials have shown significant tandem catalytic activity
for the reductive dehalogenation of PCBs.9 To understand both the fabrication of the composite structure and
how this structure affects the reaction kinetics, the Pd content of
the composite material was varied between 0 and 15 wt % Pd. In this
regard, the Cu2O/Pd materials were synthesized to have
a final deposited Pd mass of 1, 3, 6, 9, or 15%, where the percent
value listed represents the actual Pd mass % (relative to the Cu2O mass) deposited onto the oxide surface. Prior to Pd deposition,
Cu2O cubes were generated with an edge length of 665 ±
55 nm (Figure 1a). Figure 1 also presents SEM
images of the Cu2O/Pd materials after the galvanic deposition
process. In general, high yields of well-defined cubic composite structures
were generated for all of the samples. Figure 1b specifically presents the Cu2O/Pd 1% materials. Here, distinct cubes were generated with an average
edge length of 663 ± 69 nm. Such dimensions indicate that the
addition of 1% Pd by mass does not substantially alter the size of
the cubes as compared to that of the initial Cu2O structures.
As the Pd mass increased to 3, 6, 9, and 15% (Figure 1c–f), a shift in particle size was
observed; although it was evident that cubic materials were again
prepared, the average particle size increased to 689 ± 32, 738
± 67, 752 ± 63, and 814 ± 91 nm, respectively. This
increase in particle size likely arises from the deposition of the
Pd materials, as confirmed by TEM analysis (discussed below). For
all particle sizing, at least 100 cubes were measured over multiple
SEM images (Supporting Information, Figure
S1). Interestingly, an ombré color effect from light to dark
was observed for the color of the materials as the Pd content increased.
To this end, a dark amber color was noted for the Cu2O/Pd
1% sample, whereas the Cu2O/Pd 3% particles were light
brown in color. As the Pd mass increased to 6, 9, and 15%, dark brown
to black colors were observed for these materials, respectively, indicative
of the significantly higher amounts of Pd deposited.

Figure 1 SEM images of the Cu2O/Pd composite structures with
a Pd mass percent deposited of (a) 0% (bare Cu2O cubes),
(b) 1%, (c) 3%, (d) 6%, (e) 9%, and (f) 15%.

To thoroughly examine the structural effects of the various
Pd
amounts on the composite materials, TEM analysis was conducted (Figure 2). Figure 2a presents the bare Cu2O cubes prior to Pd deposition, where the left image shows
the overall cube structure and the right image displays a high-magnification
analysis of the oxide edge. Unfortunately, due to the material thickness,
imaging of the cube facet is not possible. In this sample, it is clear
that the surface of the metal oxide cube is smooth, as anticipated. Figure 2b presents the analysis
for the Cu2O/Pd 1% structures, where it is evident that
the Pd nanoparticles were directly deposited on the cube surface.
To this end, the metallic nanomaterials were imaged on the Cu2O surface as the light gray rough region at the oxide edge
as compared to the Pd-free materials. As Figure 2b depicts, the size and spatial distribution
of the noble metal components were disperse, likely arising from the
galvanic deposition process, and prior elemental mapping studies confirmed
that the Pd remains on the oxide surface.9 As the Pd content increased in the Cu2O/Pd 3, 6, 9, and
15% (Figure 2c–f)
samples, the deposited Pd layer topology of the surface became progressively
rougher and flake-like, suggesting that multiple layers of Pd materials
were incorporated.

Cu2O/Pd materials with a deposited Pd mass of (b) 1%, (c)
3%,
(d) 6%, (e) 9%, and (f) 15%. The left panel displays a single cube,
and the right panel shows the zoomed-in area indicated in the left
image.

Additional characterization to
confirm the composite material morphology
was conducted (Figure 3). To quantify the Pd content in the composite structures, EDS was
employed. From the EDS analysis of the Cu2O/Pd 9% materials
(Figure 3a), Pd was
successfully deposited, as evidenced by a strong peak at ∼2.8
keV corresponding to the Pd Lα X-ray line. As anticipated, Cu
was also present in the sample arising from the Cu2O core
component. Similar analyses were conducted for the Cu2O/Pd
1, 3, 6, and 15% materials. The EDS assessment indicated that the
deposited Pd mass percent depended on the added Pd mass percent (relative
to the Cu2O sample mass) in the galvanic exchange reaction.
The plot presented in Figure 3b shows the linear relationship between the Pd mass percent
added into the galvanic exchange reaction and the Pd mass percent
deposited on the Cu2O surface. For instance, when 153 mg
of Pd(CH3COO)2 (17% Pd mass) was added in the
reaction with 450 mg of Cu2O, 9.1 ± 0.1% Pd mass was
deposited, as measured by EDS. In general, diminished deposition amounts
were observed as compared to the reaction stoichiometry, most likely
due to incomplete Pd2+ reduction at the Cu2O
interface as the filtrate was pale yellow in color for the higher
Pd loadings. Pd wt % amounts for the Cu2O/Pd materials
were also confirmed with ICP-OES and are presented in Table S1 of
the Supporting Information. Finally, the
crystallinity of the materials was studied via powder XRD (Figure 3c). Diffraction patterns
of the as-synthesized structures were compared with the pattern for
bulk Cu2O. The diffraction patterns for all of the Cu2O/Pd materials are consistent with the cubic phase of Cu2O, displaying reflections at 29.4, 36.3, 42.2, 61.4, 73.6,
and 77.4° 2θ, corresponding to the (110), (111), (200),
(220), (311), and (222) lattice planes of Cu2O, respectively.21 Furthermore, no peaks arising from Cu0 metal, CuO, or Pd were observed. Such results suggest that Cu2O is the dominant species present in the composite materials,
consistent with the SEM, TEM, and EDS results. Additionally, the Pd
layer on the Cu2O surface is quite thin, especially when
considering the thickness of the oxide material, and beyond the detection
limit of the technique.22−24

EDS analysis of the Cu2O/Pd 9% materials. For this example,
when sufficient Pd(CH3COO)2 was added to the
bare Cu2O cubes
to reach 17% Pd mass added (relative to the Cu2O mass),
9% Pd mass was deposited, as measured by EDS. (b) Linear relationship
between the Pd mass percent added in the reaction and the Pd mass
percent deposited. (c) XRD patterns of the Cu2O/Pd materials
compared to that of Pd-free Cu2O cubes (intensities are
offset for clarity).

Taken together, significant structural differences can be
noted
in these materials based upon the effect of the Pd content. For this
study, the major difference in the preparation process for the different
materials was the amount of Pd introduced during the galvanic exchange
reaction, where the amount of Pd deposited on the Cu2O
cubes was directly proportional to the amount of Pd2+ added
into the galvanic exchange reaction. This generally resulted in an
increasingly rough and flakey material surface as greater amounts
of Pd were deposited; however, all of the different final composite
structures maintained a cubic morphology, where the size increased
proportional to the amount of Pd deposited on the oxide surface. While
the XRD measurements indicate that only Cu2O is present
in the samples, EDS and ICP-OES confirmed the presence of surface
Pd for all of the samples, which was visually observed by TEM. This
effect is attributed to the thinness of the Pd layer on the surface
of the oxide cube.24

Photocatalytic
Reactivity
The photocatalytic reductive
dechlorination of PCBs was examined using the Cu2O/Pd 1,
3, 6, 9, and 15% particles irradiated with a Hg-vapor lamp in a photochemical
cabinet. The reactivity of the materials was evaluated using three
monochlorinated PCB congeners to ascertain steric effects on the material
reactivity: PCB 1, PCB 2, and PCB 3. These PCB substrates were specifically
selected due to their positioning of the Cl group at the ortho, meta, and para positions, respectively.
Such structural features are known to affect the catalytic reactivity
based on steric constraints.25−27 For these reactions, 100 mg of
particles was mixed into 50 mL of the 25 μM PCB solution, resulting
in a 2 mg/mL catalyst loading, followed by light irradiation for 250
h. Figure 4a presents
the dechlorination analysis of PCBs 1, 2, and 3 using the Cu2O/Pd 1% materials. By monitoring the dechlorination of the PCBs over
time, the kinetics of the reactions were determined and compared.
For this system, PCB 3 (chlorine in the para position)
was dechlorinated the most efficiently. In this regard, 89% of PCB
3 was dechlorinated after 250 h, resulting in a pseudo-first-order
rate constant kPCB3 of (7.7 ± 0.7)
× 10–3 h–1.28,29 Such a result was anticipated because PCB 3 is the least sterically
hindered congener, as compared to the other substrates. When PCBs
2 and 1 were employed in the reaction system using the Cu2O/Pd 1% tandem catalysts, kPCB2 and kPCB1 values of (2.3 ± 0.5) × 10–3 and (2.4 ± 0.7) × 10–3 h–1 were noted, respectively (Figure 5 and Supporting Information, Table S2).

Figure 4 Overall reaction analysis for the photocatalytic
reductive dechlorination
of PCBs 1, 2, and 3 using the Cu2O/Pd materials at a catalyst
loading of 2 mg/mL in the reaction: (a) Cu2O/Pd 1%, (b)
Cu2O/Pd 3%, (c) Cu2O/Pd 6%, (d) Cu2O/Pd 9%, and (e) Cu2O/Pd 15%. Note that lines are added
to guide the eye.

Figure 5 Comparison of the pseudo-first-order
rate constants for PCB photodechlorination
for each of the Cu2O/Pd materials at a catalyst loading
of 2 mg/mL.

Identical analyses were
conducted for all of the composite structures
prepared at the selected Pd loadings (Figure 4). For all of the particles prepared, the
rate constants for PCB photodechlorination generally maintained the para (kPCB3) > meta (kPCB2) ≥ ortho (kPCB1) trend (Figure 5). In this regard, when the Cu2O/Pd 3% sample catalyzed the reaction, rate constants of (3.4 ±
0.5) × 10–3, (2.7 ± 0.1) × 10–3, and (6.3 ± 0.3) × 10–3 h–1 were observed for the PCB 1, 2, and 3 substrates,
respectively. Note that this is the only sample where kPCB2 < kPCB1. The k values determined for the Cu2O/Pd 6% catalyzed
reaction were (2.5 ± 0.2) × 10–3 (PCB
1), (4.0 ± 0.2) × 10–3 (PCB 2), and (7.7
± 0.3) × 10–3 h–1 (PCB
3), which were slightly higher than those noted for the Cu2O/Pd 3% system. Interestingly, the material with 9 wt % Pd content
(Cu2O/Pd 9%; Figure 4d) was the most efficient dechlorination system. Complete
dechlorination of PCB 3 was practically achieved in 75 h. At this
time point, 98% of the substrate was dechlorinated, giving rise to
a kPCB3 value of (50.8 ± 2.9) ×
10–3 h–1. Almost complete dechlorination
(95%) of PCB 2 was reached after 250 h of irradiation, with a corresponding kPCB2 value of (11.0 ± 0.7) × 10–3 h–1. For the PCB 1 substrate, diminished
reactivity was noted, as anticipated, where 39% of this reagent was
dechlorinated in 250 h, with a kPCB1 value
of (1.9 ± 0.1) × 10–3 h–1. When using the material with the highest Pd loading studied (Cu2O/Pd 15%; Figure 4e), reduced reactivity was observed as compared to the Cu2O/Pd 9% sample. In this regard, when the Cu2O/Pd
15% sample catalyzed the reaction, rate constants of (2.4 ± 0.2)
× 10–3, (6.3 ± 0.3) × 10–3, and (36.5 ± 1.3) × 10–3 h–1 were observed for the PCB 1, 2, and 3 congeners, respectively. These
lower k values, as compared to Cu2O/Pd
9%, may be due to the extensive Pd coverage of the oxide core, therefore
obstructing light absorption. Nevertheless, these results indicate
that the reactivity of the Cu2O/Pd materials for PCB photodechlorination
is maximized for 9 wt % Pd on the Cu2O core.

When
considering all of the Cu2O/Pd materials studied,
a trend was evident where the rate of reductive dehalogenation was
correlated to the location of the Cl substituent in the PCB molecule;
catalytic removal of chlorine is typically favored in the order of para > meta ≥ ortho positions.25−27 In general, while all of the synthesized structures
were photocatalytically reactive for the reductive dechlorination
of all of the PCB congeners studied, the most significant dechlorination
was observed for PCB 3, regardless of which Cu2O/Pd sample
was used as a catalyst. From this, it is evident that substrate steric
effects play an extremely important role in the material reactivity.
In particular, the rate constants for PCB 1 were the lowest among
all of the Cu2O/Pd materials, ranging over a small window
of (1.9–3.4) × 10–3 h–1. This suggests that the amount of Pd deposited on the Cu2O has little effect on the dechlorination of PCB 1, most likely due
to its steric hindrance. Furthermore, dechlorination of PCBs 2 and
3 was observed to be enhanced as the mass of Pd increased in the catalytic
materials. This likely arises from the optimized inorganic morphology
that displays increased Pd materials for reductive dechlorination,
as well as the accessibility of the Cl substituent in the substrate
structure. Taken together, these catalytic results suggest that the
Pd content, composite structures, and substrate steric effects work
synergistically to influence the overall reactivity.

On the
basis of the changes in particle structure, such information
can be correlated to the observed reactivity to determine structure/function
relationships. In general, the greatest reactivity for the photodechlorination
reaction was observed from the Cu2O/Pd 9% sample. Such
results were quite interesting as this material did not possess the
greatest amount of surface-deposited Pd. To elucidate the structure/function
relationships of the composite material, a set of control experiments
was carried out. To probe the photocatalytic effect of the Cu2O materials, a solution of PCB 3 was bubbled with H2 for 5 h in the presence of Cu2O/Pd 9% particles at a
catalyst loading of 2 mg/mL while in the dark (Supporting Information, Figure S2a). After 3 h, complete dechlorination
of PCB 3 was observed with only a modest amount of biphenyl being
detected. It is likely that biphenyl was the dominant product generated,
as indicated by GC analysis; however, due to the catalytic setup,
aerosolization of the biphenyl occurred, resulting in diminished amounts
detected. To confirm this aerosolization effect, a solution of biphenyl
was bubbled with H2 for 5 h in the absence of a photocatalyst
while in the dark (Supporting Information, Figure S2b). Within 2.5 h, complete aerosolization of biphenyl
was observed. Taken together, these results suggest that the production
of H2 is the rate-determining step for the tandem catalytic
process. In this regard, the high degree of Pd coverage for this sample
is anticipated to facilitate H2 generation to greater degrees
than those materials with lesser amounts of Pd, as observed herein,
due to diminished charge recombination effects; however, when more
Pd is deposited on the surface, as in the Cu2O/Pd 15% sample,
lower reactivity is observed due to diminished light absorptivity
by the Cu2O core. In addition to activating the reductive
dehalogenation step of the tandem catalytic process, the Pd metal
surface likely increases the overall surface area of the composite
structure, providing additional adsorption sites for H+ ions. Pd could then reduce adsorbed H+ ions through the
electrons transferred from the Cu2O conduction band to
form H2.30 Previous BET surface
analysis has confirmed that surface-deposited Pd increases the overall
surface area of the composite material.9 Therefore, it is possible for H2 generation to occur
at both the Cu2O and Pd sites. Altogether, these results
provide important insights into the catalytic functions of the individual
components of the composite structure and their overall roles in the
tandem catalytic process.

To confirm that the observed reactivity
arose from the particles
and not light-based degradation of PCBs, a series of additional control
studies was conducted. For this, solutions of PCBs 1, 2, and 3 were
irradiated for 250 h in the absence of the photocatalyst (Supporting Information, Figure S3). In general,
while all of the PCB congeners demonstrated varying degrees of photobased
degradation, biphenyl formation was negligible. For instance, PCB
1 was quickly converted into other oxidative, and nonreductive, dechlorination
products, such as hydroxybiphenyl, as detected via GC-MS, with minor
generation of biphenyl. Furthermore, in agreement with previous studies,28,29 it was observed that PCB photodegradation was favored in the order
of Cl substitution at the ortho > meta > para positions under light irradiation in
the
absence of a photocatalyst. Such a trend is in direct opposition to
the current results, where photocatalytic reductive dehalogenation
of PCBs favored a Cl substitution order of para > meta ≥ ortho positions, with biphenyl
as the only product formed. Taken together, this suggests that other
photodriven chemical processes that do not follow reductive dechlorination
pathways are occurring in the absence of the catalyst to generate
such products as hydroxylated PCBs. It should be noted that hydroxylated
PCBs have enhanced toxicity compared to that of the parent substrate;31−33 thus, reductive pathways of degradation, as provided by the Cu2O/Pd material, are preferred.

While the above control
reactions confirmed the Cu2O/Pd
reductive dechlorination reactivity, it is essential to determine
at what concentration the catalyst loading affects the tandem photocatalytic
performance. This is especially important for transitioning energy-
and material-intensive processes to photocatalytic routes in order
to maximize reactivity while minimizing the consumption of resources.
In this regard, modified photocatalytic reactions using the Cu2O/Pd 9% materials were carried out where the catalyst mass
employed was varied to provide loadings of 1 and 3 mg/mL. Note that
all of the reactions discussed above have a catalyst loading of 2
mg/mL. From this analysis, shown in Figure 6a, different reactivities were observed for
the various catalyst loadings for the dechlorination of PCB 3. Interestingly,
under these conditions, 2 mg/mL was the optimal catalyst loading for
the dechlorination process. As mentioned above, under these conditions
98% of PCB 3 was dechlorinated in 75 h, with a kPCB3 value of (50.8 ± 2.9) × 10–3 h–1 (Figure 6b and Supporting Information, Table S3). The 1 mg/mL catalyst loading gave a decreased kPCB3 value of (17.6 ± 0.7) × 10–3 h–1. A further diminished kPCB3 value of (9.9 ± 0.9) × 10–3 h–1 was observed for the 3 mg/mL
catalyst loading. These results indicate that 2 mg/mL is the most
efficient catalyst loading for the dechlorination process. At a lower
catalyst loading, the decreased amount of catalytic materials presented
led to lower reactivity, whereas for the 3 mg/mL catalyst loading,
the high material concentration resulted in inefficient light absorption
by the materials, causing diminished reactivity.

Figure 6 Catalyst loading analysis
using the Cu2O/Pd 9% materials
for the photocatalytic reductive dechlorination of PCB 3: (a) overall
reaction analysis using the indicated catalyst loadings and (b) comparison
of the pseudo-first-order rate constants for each of the indicated
catalyst loadings.

From the above studies,
it is clear that the Cu2O/Pd
materials control the overall photodriven reductive dechlorination
process and that the reaction rates are highly sensitive to the composite
structure and catalyst loading. To probe whether the photocatalytic
reductive dechlorination reaction affects the material structure,
SEM and TEM analyses were conducted on the Cu2O/Pd 9% materials
after being used for the dechlorination of PCB 3 at a catalyst loading
of 2 mg/mL, as shown in Figure 7. Additional SEM and TEM images of the materials presented
for the postreaction analysis can be found in the Supporting Information, Figure S4. Imaging of the Cu2O/Pd 9% cubes postdechlorination showed that while the majority of
the structures remained intact, some of the particles became hollow
(∼29%). In this regard, Figure 7a shows a large area SEM image of the materials where
fully intact materials are present, although hollow structures are
also evident. Figure 7b shows a zoomed-in SEM image of the cubic materials in the red box
of Figure 7a. In this
image, it is apparent that significant internal structural changes
have occurred for this set of materials. TEM analysis of these materials
further exposes the dramatic structural changes to the particles that
become hollow during the reaction (Figure 7c). In this image, it is clear that the Cu2O/Pd materials have been internally changed, whereby the oxide
component was potentially partially etched while the Pd layer remained
intact. To examine the material composition of the postdechlorinated
particles, EDS analysis was performed. These assessments indicated
that the Pd content (relative to the Cu2O mass) of the
composite structures increased from 9.1 ± 0.1% Pd mass before
the reaction to 9.6 ± 0.6% Pd mass after the reaction occurred,
suggesting that the morphological changes arose predominantly from
partial etching of the oxide component.

the Cu2O/Pd 9% structures after
the photocatalytic reductive dechlorination of PCB 3 using a catalyst
loading of 2 mg/mL. (a, b) SEM and (c) TEM images. Panel (b) shows
a zoomed-in image of the red box in panel (a).

To identify and understand the structural modifications to
the
particle morphology due to photocatalysis as opposed to photocorrosion,
a set of control experiments was conducted. In this study, at a catalyst
loading of 2 mg/mL, the Cu2O/Pd 9% materials were photoirradiated
in the reaction solvent for 250 h in the absence of PCBs. SEM analysis
showed that the majority of the cubes were still whole (71% of the
sample); however, 29% of the materials appeared to be pitted, suggesting
that photocorrosion had occurred (Supporting Information, Figure S5a).8,34,35 This pitted morphology was significantly different than that observed
after the photodechlorination reaction, which generated hollow structures,
suggesting that the hollowing effect was not due to photocorrosion.
To reaffirm this hypothesis, a second control study was completed
where bare Cu2O cubes at a catalyst loading of 2 mg/mL
were photoirradiated in the solvent for 250 h. In this analysis, pronounced
surface reconstruction was observed (Supporting Information, Figure S5b), displaying jagged overgrowths on
the oxide. Although no pitting was evident in the bare Cu2O sample, hollow cubes were also not observed, supporting the hypothesis
that photocorrosion does not drive Cu2O/Pd material etching.

These postreaction analyses provide important insights concerning
the photocatalytic mechanism of the Cu2O/Pd composite structures.
In the reaction system with PCB 3, hollowing of the cubes is evident.
This control study suggests that the hollow cubes are a result of
photodechlorination, which may affect the recyclability of the materials vide infra; pitting is evident from the Cu2O/Pd
9% materials and particle surface reconstruction is observed in the
bare Cu2O cubes after being photoirradiated in ethanol/water.
Additionally, the postdechlorination wide-area EDS analysis shows
that the Pd mass percent is higher after the reaction. Taken together,
these postreaction analyses suggest that photodechlorination is responsible
for the hollowing of the cubes. Although speculative, it is possible
that the shell of the hollow cubes is composed mainly of Pd; however,
additional studies are required to determine this fine level of detail.

Because of the observed structural changes of the Cu2O/Pd after the first catalytic cycle, a reduction in the photocatalytic
activity for subsequent catalytic cycles could be observed. As such,
recyclability studies of the composite materials as catalysts for
PCB photodechlorination were conducted using Cu2O/Pd 7.5%
materials with PCB 3 at a catalyst loading of 2 mg/mL. Figure S6 in
the Supporting Information presents the
dechlorination analysis and the resulting rate constants for the recyclability
studies. For this process, when the 75 h reaction period of the first
cycle was completed, the Cu2O/Pd 7.5% material was filtered,
washed, and dried. Once the material was completely dry, it was weighed,
and the appropriate volume of PCB 3 was added in order to maintain
a catalyst loading of 2 mg/mL. For the first cycle, 88% of PCB 3 was
dechlorinated after 75 h, resulting in a kPCB3 value of (29.8 ± 2.0) × 10–3 h–1. For the second cycle, 60% of PCB 3 was dechlorinated after 75 h,
giving a kPCB3 value of (10.6 ± 1.2)
× 10–3 h–1. As is evident,
diminished reactivity was noted for the second reaction cycle, likely
arising from the catalytic material degradation. It is evident that
the redox potential of Cu2O intrinsically exists within
its band gap energy, which might lead to self-oxidation or self-reduction
and depletion of copper species into the solution.36 Additionally, Cu2O oxidation to CuO at the composite
material surface could be occurring resulting in diminished reactivity;
however, partial reduction back to Cu2O should restore
the reactivity. Additional studies are required to determine the actual
basis of the reactivity changes.

Optimization of this tandem
catalytic system is still in progress;
however, in comparison to other catalysts used for the dechlorination
of PCBs, the Cu2O/Pd composite materials are highly unique
in that light is used as the energy source to drive the reaction.
For this, the most established class of materials for PCB dechlorination
is based on Pd/Fe nanostructures. For example, Wang et al. reported
the synthesis of nanoscale Pd/Fe particles for the dechlorination
of PCBs.37 Within 17 h, complete dechlorination
of the PCB congeners of Aroclor 1254 by Pd/Fe nanoparticles was observed.
The initial PCB solution mixture concentration was 5 mg/L, and the
catalyst loading was 50 mg/mL. Although complete dechlorination was
achieved within 17 h, a less concentrated PCB solution and a significantly
higher catalyst loading than those employed herein were used. In an
additional approach, Zahran et al. synthesized Pd/Fe bimetallic nanotubes
that demonstrated high reactivity.38 Dechlorination
of 25 μM 3,3′4,4′-tetrachlorobiphenyl using Pd/Fe
bimetallic nanotubes with 0.9 wt % Pd was achieved in 25 h at a catalyst
loading of 0.25 mg/mL. This high dechlorination efficiency was attributed
to the high surface area to volume ratio of the hollow nanotubes structure.
For these systems, the production of H2 by Fe0 in aqueous solution leads to iron corrosion. As such, H2 production and iron reactivity decrease over time; therefore, Pd/Fe
materials are not sustainable as a result of surface oxidation and
precipitation of iron oxides/hydroxides on the surface of the iron.39,40 While these materials are the most reactive for PCB dechlorination,
they are not directly comparable to the Cu2O/Pd systems
due to the significant differences in H2 generation (Fe
oxidation vs photocatalysis). While the Cu2O/Pd materials
demonstrated lower reactivity, they represent a new avenue to materials
with potential long-term reactivity for in-field photodechlorination
using sunlight as the energy source. Further studies are underway
to enhance the reactivity of the tandem catalysts, including pathways
to enhance their recyclability.

Conclusions
In
summary, we have generated cubic Cu2O/Pd composite
structures with tandem photocatalytic reactivity. It was demonstrated
that the Pd content in the material affects the particle surface morphology,
where higher amounts of Pd result in structures with a flakey topology.
Additionally, the cubic shape of the particles was maintained regardless
of the material composition. Although simple, this architecture is
strategic for transitioning energy- and material-intensive reactions
that require H2 as a reagent to more sustainable, photocatalytic
methods. The as-synthesized Cu2O/Pd particles demonstrated
high tandem catalytic performance for the reductive dehalogenation
of PCBs 3 and 2, but they showed slow dechlorination rates for PCB
1. The data indicate that the overall dechlorination reaction rate
results from a synergistic effect of several key factors, including
the surface morphology and composition of the materials and the steric
effects of the substrate. Postreaction analysis showed that some of
the Cu2O/Pd cubes had become hollow following dechlorination.
The light-driven tandem catalytic system demonstrated herein exemplifies
how current photocatalyst materials for H2 production can
be applied to reactions not typically fueled by light. The fundamental
understanding of material structural effects over catalytic function
and reactivity is important in the design of photocatalytic systems
for sustainable reactivity.
