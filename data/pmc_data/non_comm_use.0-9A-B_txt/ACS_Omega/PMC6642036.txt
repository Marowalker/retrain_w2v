We report significantly improved
silicon nanowire/TiO2 n+–n heterojunction
solar cells prepared by sol–gel
synthesis of TiO2 thin film atop vertically aligned silicon
nanowire arrays obtained by facile metal-assisted wet electroless
chemical etching of a bulk highly doped n-type silicon wafer. As we
show here, chemical treatment of the nanowire arrays prior to depositing
the sol–gel precursor has dramatic consequences on the device
performance. While hydrofluoric treatment to remove the native oxide
already improves significantly the device performances, hydrobromic
(HBr) treatment consistently yields by far the best device performances
with power conversion efficiencies ranging between 4.2 and 6.2% with
fill factors up to 60% under AM 1.5G illumination. In addition to
yield high-quality and easy to produce solar cell devices, these findings
regarding the surface treatment of silicon nanowires with HBr suggest
that HBr could contribute to the enhancement of the device performance
not only for solar cells but also for other optoelectronics devices
based on semiconductor nanostructures.

Introduction
In recent years, the
fabrication of silicon (Si) hybrid heterojunction
solar cells has generated a significant interest because it can promise
higher efficiencies at significantly lower fabrication costs.1−4 Semiconductor heterojunction can be advantageous because both materials
can absorb light from different regions of the solar spectrum.5,6 Efforts have also been made to better understand and exploit the
unique electrical, mechanical, and thermal properties of nanowires
(NWs) for photovoltaic device integration.7,8 Finally,
silicon is already well-known to be cheap, nontoxic, and abundant.9,10 These combined advantages coupled with adequate industrial infrastructure
can help produce SiNW-based devices at relatively low manufacturing
costs. Metal-assisted wet-chemical etching (MAWCE) of bulk silicon
wafers can allow useful all-solution-based mass production of ordered
vertically aligned NW arrays over large areas because it permits control
over the geometry of their diameter, length, and spacing, while avoiding
high-cost and low-output usual lithographic processes.11−13 MAWCE is based on the principles of the galvanic displacement reaction,
details of which have been previously discussed.14−16

Meanwhile,
anatase TiO2 is a wide-bandgap, n-type semiconductor.17 TiO2 is already widely used for carrier
extraction in dye- and quantum dot-sensitized solar cells18,19 and as a transparent front contact in heterojunction solar cells.20,21 However, fewer reports describe how TiO2 can also be
used as the main component for fabricating an efficient heterojunction
with Si. This is because previous studies mainly focused on fabricating
narrow-band gap semiconductors.22,23

Indeed, n-type
silicon NWs can also be used in conjunction with
anatase TiO2 to form an n+–n isotype
heterojunction with favorable band-alignment to produce good solar
cell devices.24,25 However, early efforts to fabricate
n-Si/n-TiO2 isotype heterojunction solar cells have yielded
very low efficiencies, to the tune of 0.0005% with a small fill factor
(FF) of 21%.24 Subsequently, researchers
fabricated a TiO2 heterojunction in conjunction with silicon
NWs, which seemingly improved both short-circuit current density and
open-circuit voltage, essential traits for the fabrication of solar
cells.25 Meanwhile, p-type silicon coated
with anatase TiO2 is limited by unfavorable band-bending
at the heterojunction.16,25 In the case of a p-SiNW and n-TiO2 heterojunction, the band energies of n-TiO2 will
shift upward, whereas the band energies of p-SiNWs will shift downward
at open circuit under illumination. Thus, the open-circuit voltage
(Voc) from the cell will be the Voc of the TiO2/front contact junction
minus Voc of the SiNWs/TiO2 junction as shown in Figure 1a. However, photogenerated holes in the Si move toward TiO2 to recombine with electrons because of a built-in electric
field in the space-charge region for n-SiNWs/n-TiO2.18,24 Hence, the open-circuit voltage (Voc) for n-SiNWs/n-TiO2 will be the sum of the Voc at the n-TiO2/front contact junction plus
the Voc at n-SiNWs/n-TiO2 junction
because, the Fermi energy (EF) and band
energies of n-SiNWs and n-TiO2 shift upward at open circuit
conditions under illumination as shown in Figure 1a.

Figure 1 (a) Band diagram of the n–n isotype heterojunction
(left)
and band diagram of the p–n heterojunction (right). (b) Schematic
of the n SiNWs/TiO2 heterojunction solar cell.

However, we should also consider several other
critical issues
to maximize the silicon NW/TiO2 photovoltaic device performances.
First, carrier recombination loss26,27 should be
minimized to increase the FF, thereby increasing the power conversion
efficiency (η) of the devices. Second, carrier diffusion should
also be limited to favor carrier extraction.28,29 Surface recombination is a major concern for NW-based devices because
of their high surface-to-volume ratios. Presence of dangling bonds
at the surface can significantly reduce the photovoltaic performance
of NW-based devices by trapping the impurities and then electronically
neutralizing them.30 It has been shown
that, reducing the surface recombination can dramatically increase
the photosensitivity of photodetectors by up to 2 orders of magnitude.30,31 As such, reduced surface recombination at the NW surface is shown
to increase in open-circuit voltage, short-circuit current, and overall
η of the NW-based solar cells.22 Thermal
SiO2,32,33 a-SiNx:H,34,35 or Al2O336,37 are some of the materials most widely used for such surface passivation.

In this report, we explore isotype heterojunction devices produced
from n-type silicon NWs covered with anatase TiO2 produced
by sol–gel chemistry, and we propose a new pathway toward the
fabrication of a low-cost, all-solution-based, easily available n-SiNW/n-TiO2 isotype photovoltaic device using interface engineering.
Indeed, we demonstrate dramatic improvements in the photovoltaic performance
of silicon NW/TiO2 n–n isotype heterojunction solar
cell devices containing H+ passivated NW surfaces obtained
through hydrobromic (HBr) treatment just before fabrications of the
heterojunction. Compared with untreated and hydrofluoric (HF)-treated
NW arrays, the photovoltaic performances of these HBr-treated heterojunction
solar cells have improved by 2 orders of magnitude to consistently
achieve power conversion efficiencies (η) ranging between 4.2
and 6.2%. In the future, we believe that such a surface modification
using solution-based HBr will yield significantly better heterojunction
devices fabricated in an efficient and cost-effective manner.

Results
and Discussion
Structure of the Solar Cells
Figure 1b shows the schematics
for the SiNWs/TiO2 heterojunction solar cell device and
its band alignment (Figure 1a). The heterojunction
device observed under a scanning electron microscopy (SEM) system
after each step is shown in Figure 2. Figure 2a,b shows the SEM micrograph of vertically aligned n-type SiNWs of
approximately 800–1000 nm in length and 40–50 nm in
diameter produced by MAWCE over large area using the protocol fully
described in the experimental section.

using the galvanic displacement method, (c) Raman peaks for anatase
TiO2 on SiNWs. (d) SEM micrograph of the SiNWs/TiO2 bulk heterojunction.

The MAWCE-prepared silicon NWs are then immersed in 20% HBr
solution
for 2 min. Following treatment, the etched substrate is spin-coated
with TiO2 sol–gel precursor solution, followed by
a thermal conversion at 550 °C for 1 h to obtain the anatase
crystalline TiO2 layer. Ideally, this thermal treatment
should be performed by rapid thermal annealing. In contrast, a thermal
cycling in a regular furnace consists of few ramps to reach the desired
temperature and to cool down to room temperature which takes several
hours. This process is harmful for the abruptness of the heterojunction.
It can move the junction further away from and more difficult to reach
for the photons. Therefore, the device should not stay for a long
time inside the furnace. Figure 2c shows the Raman spectra of the converted anatase
TiO2 coated atop the SiNW array. We observe the three peaks
at 395, 513, and 634 cm–1, which are characteristic
peaks for anatase TiO2. Figure 2d shows the SEM micrograph of the 45°
tilted cross section of the NW array after sol–gel precursor
deposition and complete conversion to anatase TiO2.

We have investigated the effectiveness of the native oxide removal
by dipping the samples in 2, 10, and 20% concentrated solutions of
HF and HBr for 2 min each. Energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis
was performed to inspect the atomic percentage of oxygen in these
samples. The samples were transferred for EDX measurements within
an hour of the surface treatments. The EDX spectra were collected
from the NW surfaces. Table S1 in the Supporting Information section demonstrates the atomic percentage of oxygen
present in the sample surfaces. We have observed that a higher concentration
of HBr provides an almost oxygen-free silicon surface, whereas in
case of HF-treated samples, the amount of oxygen remains same as in
2 to 20% concentration. We have found that these results are in good
agreement with the literature.38,39 Hence, we have used
2% HF and 20% HBr for the surface treatments.

We also have varied
the treatment time of HF and HBr from 1 to
30 min to investigate the atomic percentage of oxygen amount on the
surfaces. We have performed EDX analysis to optimize the amounts of
oxygen present in the devices. The samples were transferred for EDX
measurements within 1 h of the surface treatments. The EDX spectra
were collected from the NW surfaces. The optimized parameters of the
atomic percentage of oxygen from all the samples are depicted in Table S2. We have observed a reduced percentage
of oxygen after 2 min of HF or HBr treatments. The EDX shows a similar
amount of oxygen with HF or HBr till 30 min of the treatments. Hence,
the surface treatment effect gets saturated after 2 min immersion
in 2% HF or with 20% HBr.

Performance of the Solar Cells
The
current density–voltage
(J–V) characteristics under
the air mass (AM) 1.5G condition are plotted in Figure 3. In total, we fabricated 24 solar cells
with optimized parameters and investigated the variations in their J–V characteristics. These devices
are divided equally into three groups of eight samples in preparation
for surface treatment. Devices from the first group (pristine) did
not sustain any chemical treatment prior to the junction fabrication.
Samples from the second group are treated with 2% HF for 2 min to
remove the native oxide layer from the SiNW surface before sol–gel
deposition. The last group of samples is treated with 20% HBr for
2 min.

Figure 3 (a) J–V curve of the heterojunction
solar cells under AM 1.5G from group 1 (pristine) devices, (b) J–V curve from group 2 (HF-treated)
devices, (c) J–V curve from
group 3 (HBr-treated) devices, and (d), J–V curve of best performing devices from each group (pristine,
HF-treated, and HBr-treated).

Figure 3 shows
some
photovoltaic behavior from all these 24 solar cell devices. First, Figure 3a shows the J–V characteristics for the solar
cells without any treatment prior to sol–gel deposition, and
their device parameters are listed in Table S3. For this first group of eight samples, we measure short-circuit
current densities (Jsc) between 0.6 and
1.2 mA, open-circuit voltages (Voc) between
143 and 224 mV, and FF in the range of 20.6–32.5%. Thus, the
power conversion efficiencies measured from these devices are very
small (0.03–0.06%).

In contrast, Figure 3b shows the J–V characteristics
of all the devices from the samples treated with HF prior to sol–gel
deposition, and their device parameters are listed in Table S4. For this second group of eight samples,
we measure short-circuit current densities (Jsc) between 8.4 and 12.1 mA, open-circuit voltages (Voc) between 421 and 514 mV, and FF in the range
of 26.1–37.7%. As such, the power conversion efficiencies are
between 1.2 and 2.0% and significantly (30–40×) higher
compared to the group 1 (untreated) devices.

Finally, Figure 3c shows the J–V characteristics
of all the devices from the samples treated with HBr prior to sol–gel
deposition, and their device parameters are listed in Table S5. For this third group of eight samples,
we measure short-circuit current densities (Jsc) between 15.3 and 18.4 mA, open-circuit voltages (Voc) between 482 and 553 mV, and FF in the range
of 48.1–60.3%. The power conversion efficiencies are between
4.2 and 6.15% and again significantly (3–4×) higher compared
to the HF-treated devices and close to 100× higher compared to
any sample from the first group (untreated). Figure 3d compares the J–V characteristics for the best device from each group under
AM 1.5G illuminations. Clearly, HBr-treated devices perform way better
than the untreated or HF-treated devices.

The logarithmic J–V characteristics
in the dark are shown in Figure 4. Figure 4a–c shows the dark J–V characteristics for the eight devices from groups 1, 2, and 3 respectively. Figure 4d compares the dark J–V characteristics for the best
device from each group. Clearly, the devices treated with HBr show
very small reverse leakage current compared to the other devices.
This suggests a reduction in the series resistance and increase in
the shunt resistance for the solar cells treated with 20% HBr. Also,
a significant increase in the dark current is noticed under forward
bias condition above 400 mV, which indicates a clear improvement in
the hole extraction efficiency after the interface treatment with
HBr.

(b) log-plot of the dark current of group 2 (HF-treated) devices,
(c) log-plot of the dark current of group 3 (HBr-treated) devices,
and (d) log-plot of the dark current of best performing devices from
each group (pristine, HF-treated, and HBr-treated).

Figure 5 shows histogram
distributions of the (a) power conversion efficiencies (η),
(b) short-circuit current densities (Jsc), (c) open-circuit voltages (Voc), and
(d) FF for the 24 devices from the three different groups. The histogram
reveals a wide distribution of η between 0.03 and 6.2%. Similar
responses have been found from the FF values distributed between 21
and 60%. It is shown that Jsc and Voc values are also distributed between 0.6 and
18.4 mA/cm2 and 143–553 mV, respectively. The origin
of these large variations in all the parameters comes from the interfacial
treatment with HBr. This treatment clearly provides significantly
better device characteristics overall by controlling the oxidation
of the junction.

groups.

Role of Surface Treatment
Using HBr and HF in SiNWs/TiO2 Solar Cells
We
have observed a dramatic increase
in the photovoltaic performance in HBr-treated solar cells. As predicted
elsewhere,30,31 surface recombination in the
SiNW surface has a substantial impact on the short-circuit current
density and open-circuit voltage. Comparing the J–V characteristics of all the 24 devices,
it can be clearly observed that the devices treated with HBr before
the sol–gel deposition yield much higher short-circuit current
densities and open-circuit voltages compared with the other HF-treated
or untreated devices. Thus, we have obtained significantly improved
fill-factors and power conversion efficiencies from those devices.
This improvement in the device performance can be attributed to the
surface passivation effect of HF and HBr on the SiNW surface.40 To prove this effect, we have performed X-ray
photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements of Si 2p, O 1s, and
C 1s peak levels from the pristine, HF-treated and HBr-treated SiNW
surfaces as depicted in Figure 6a–c. The XPS spectra have been collected within 2 h
after the surface treatments. The impression of higher binding energy
peak in the Si 2p region (Figure 6a) is an indication of the growth of a surface oxide
layer. Also, we have observed the emergence of a peak in the O 1s
region (Figure 6b),
providing a clear signature of the formation of a surface oxide layer
immediately after the treatment. It is evident from the XPS result
that the HBr-treated SiNW sample has a lower rate of surface oxidation
compared to the pristine or HF-treated SiNW samples. One possible
hypothesis for this decreased oxidation effect can be ascribed to
the fact that HF and HBr treatment results in H-terminated NW surfaces.40,41 However, HBr treatment gives a better passivation effect than HF.42 This is most likely because HF is a weak acid
that cannot dissociate completely in the water solution.43 Hence, the etching mechanism of the native oxide
layer is changeable depending on the nature of the fluorine species
that dominates the surface treatment process.44 The main elements in the solution for low pH are HF and HF2, whereas in case of higher pH HF2 dominates. Moreover,
fluorine has the largest electronegativity of 4.98, whereas bromine
has an electronegativity of 2.96. Hence, the ionic bond is stronger
between hydrogen and fluorine as compared to hydrogen and bromine.
Thus, HF releases less H+ ions in the water solution as
compared to HBr. Because the H+ concentration in diluted
aqueous HF is low (∼pH 3.27), the dissolution into the water
solution is not very efficient thus re-oxidizes fast.42,45 On the contrary, HBr is a strong acid (∼pH 3.01) that can
fully dissociate in water,46 thus releasing
more H+ ions in the solution and therefore is more efficient
to remove the oxide layer from the NW surface. Hence, we can notice
an increased lifespan of the surface passivation effect on the HBr-treated
sample compared to the HF-treated one. We have observed from the XPS
measurements that the pristine SiNW devices contain large amounts
of native oxide layers and carbon contaminations. This oxide layer
works as a barrier that appears to prevent the tunneling of the photogenerated
carriers, hence making it difficult for them to reach the contacts.
On the other hand, removing the native oxide layer helps to transit
the photogenerated carriers to the contacts in case of HF- and HBr-treated
devices. Hence, these HBr-treated SiNWs/TiO2 heterojunction
are better candidates for photovoltaic devices as compared to the
pristine or HF-treated devices.

(c) C 1s peaks from the
pristine (non-treated) (black) and HF-treated (red) and HBr-treated

Conclusions
In this work, we have investigated the
photovoltaic performance
of n-SiNWs/TiO2-based heterojunction solar cells by chemically
treating the SiNWs with HBr and HF. We have demonstrated that the
chemical treatment of the SiNWs with HBr before the junction fabrication
leads to an H-passivation of dangling bonds and suppression of the
fixed charges at the interface. The photovoltaic performance of HBr-treated
n-SiNWs/TiO2 heterojunction solar cells yields much higher
power conversion efficiencies (up to 6.2%) compared to other treatments.
Our findings reveal the potential use of HBr treatment for improving
the performances of SiNW-based photovoltaic and optoelectronic devices.

Experimental
Section
Synthesis of Vertically Aligned Silicon NWs
Vertically
aligned silicon NWs were synthesized using the MAWCEmethod via the
galvanic displacement reaction. We have found the galvanic displacement
method as the most cost-effective technique than any other methods
used for the synthesis of silicon NWs. Details of this process have
been described elsewhere.15,16

For our work,
we have used n-type silicon wafer with resistivity 1–10 Ω
cm. The etchant composition was 0.02 M silver nitrate solution (AgNO3) with 4.8 M hydrogen fluoride acid (HF) mixed with a 1:1
ratio. The etching takes place at room temperature for 40 min. The
residual silver nanoparticles have been removed completely at room
temperature using 70% nitric acid (HNO3) solution and DI
water in 1:2 ratio for 1 h. The diameter of the NWs varied in the
range between 40 and 50 nm, and the length was in between 800 and
1000 nm. Figure 2 shows
the cross-sectional morphology of the fabricated silicon NWs.

Synthesis
of TiO2 Sol–Gel
A thin
film layer of anatase TiO2 has been deposited on top of
the as-prepared silicon NWs to form the heterojunction. There are
several ways to synthesize TiO2, sol–gel being one
of the most popular because it allows easy processing of the material
as thin films or even to the nanometer scale using common processes
such as dip-coating and spin-coating. Most importantly, TiO2 synthesized through the sol–gel method offers advantages
such as room-temperature reaction, high homogeneity, and purity of
the final product. In this study, Raman spectroscopy was used to verify
the crystalline structure of the obtained TiO2. Characteristic
peaks of the anatase phase were observed at 395, 513, and 634 cm–1 as shown in Figure 2c. The peak observed for anatase TiO2 at
513 cm–1 coincides with the SiNW peak; hence, we
observed an intense peak at 513 cm–1.

The
TiO2 solution has been synthesized using the modified sol–gel
technique.47 First, 28.8532 g of ethanol
was mixed with 1.4748 g of acetylacetonate (ACAC) in a beaker and
covered with parafilm. This mixture was stirred with a magnetic stirrer
for 20 min. Then, 10.8604 g of titanium butoxide (TBT) was added to
this mixture, and covered with parafilm again. Then, stirring of this
mixture occurs for 40 min. Finally, 0.84 mL of DI water was added
to the mixture, covered with parafilm, and stirred for 120 min. The
TiO2 sol gel will be in optimum condition to be used after
24 h of starting the reaction. The addition of ACAC decreases the
hydrolysis velocity of the TBT during the sol–gel reaction,
helping to avoid the formation of precipitates and chunks.

Formation
of the Heterojunction
The as-prepared NWs
are cleaned using 20% HBr for 2 min. Then, TiO2 sol–gel
coating was done via the spin-coating method. The spin rate was set
at 500 rpm for 20 s and 2000 rpm for 40 s. Then, the samples are annealed
at 550 °C for 1 h to get the anatase crystalline structure of
the TiO2.

Contact Fabrication
Silver finger
grids have been deposited
via the sputtering technique to serve as a front contact for the heterojunction
solar cells. The thin film layer of Al has been deposited as a back
contact via the sputtering technique. The thickness of this Al layer
was 200 nm. After the sputtering process, the sample was annealed
at 350 °C for 10 min in a nitrogen environment. After the heat
treatment, the solar cells are ready for characterizations.

Device
Characterization
The SiNW samples were characterized
using a Hitachi SU-8230 field emission SEM system. The anatase nature
of TiO2 was seen using a WITec alpha300 micro-Raman system
equipped with a 532 nm fiber-coupled laser for excitation. The surface
passivation effect was investigated using XPS measurement using a
VG ESCALAB 3 Mark II XPS machine equipped with an Mg Kα source.
The solar cells were characterized using a solar panel test bench
equipped with a Keithley 2400 source meter under 1.5G air mass condition.
