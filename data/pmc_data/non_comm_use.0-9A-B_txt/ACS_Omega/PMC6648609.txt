The
electronic and magnetic properties of h-BN nanoribbions embedded
with graphene nanoflakes (CBNNRs) are systematically studied by ab
initio calculations. The CBNNRs with zigzag or armchair edges are
all bipolar magnetic semiconductors (BMSs). The band gaps of zigzag
CBNNRs (zCBNNRs) change linearly with the transverse electric field
(E-field) for the first-order Stark effect, whereas
for the armchair CBNNRs (aCBNNRs), the band gaps vary quadratically
with the E-field for the second-order Stark effect.
For zCBNNRs and aCBNNRs, they could transform from BMS to spin gapless
semiconductor (SGS), metal, and half-metal (HM) under different
transverse E-fields. The CBNNRs may transform into
a semiconductor or HM, under the same E-fields, depending
on the position of graphene flakes. The CBNNRs introduce local magnetic
moment at carbon atoms, and the magnetic moment is determined by the
size of the graphene flakes. These observations open the door to applications
of CBNNRs in spintronic devices.

1 Introduction
In
2004, Geim et al. successfully isolated graphene by using the
micromechanical exfoliation method1 and
graphene has worked as an attractive candidate material for electromechanical
resonators, flexible electronic circuitry, ultra-capacitors, stable
field emitters, and as fillers for electrically conducting flexible
nanocomposites.2−4 Researchers started to explore hexagonal boron nitride
(h-BN),5 since two-dimensional (2D) h-BN
nanosheets have distinct advantages compared with graphene;6,7 for example, they are electrically insulating (a band gap of 5 eV),
have profound chemical and thermal stabilities,5 but at the same time are thermally conductive and mechanically
robust as their C counterparts.6 So the
2D h-BN nanosheet is also named “white” graphene.8 Combining carbon with its neighboring atoms in
the periodic table (boron and nitrogen) offers a host of different
hybrid hexagonal CBN nanosystems.9,10 As discussed
above, graphene is a semimetal1 whereas
h-BN is an insulator with a wide band gap.5,7 The
h-CBN structures may have energy band gaps smaller than that of h-BN
and can be continuously tuned by changing the concentration and arrangement
of the C and BN.9,10 These attractive physical properties
as well as chemical inertness motivated the attempt to produce h-CBN.
Various approaches, including ion beam-assisted deposition,11 magnetron sputtering,12 radio frequency plasma enhanced pulsed-laser deposition,13 excimer laser annealing,14 and chemical vapor deposition (CVD),12,15−22 were used to grow the h-CBN thin films. In fact, the phase separation
is the most challenging obstacle for producing crystalline bulks and
films.23−32 Mixtures of pure BN and graphene domains coexist in these compounds.28,29,33,34

A breakthrough on the controlled CVD preparation and characterization
of epitaxial CBN nanosheets has recently been reported by Ci et al.,
who developed a systematic route to synthesize 2D CBN hybrid structures
consisting of a patchwork of BN and C nanodomains. He also has synthesized
the graphene flakes with a triangular shape doped into the h-BN monolayer
and confirmed in the scanning tunneling microscopy.35 The doped electron or hole could effectively tune the formation
energy of complex CBN structures.36  The triangular
graphene flakes are synthesized highly crystalline hybrid BNC sheets
by Han et al., and the results reveal that embedded C2 or C6 units
in BN-dominated regions energetically are the most favorable.37 In 2013, Lu et al. demonstrated that metal substrate-catalyzed
substitutional exchange of h-BN by carbon atoms presented a route
for doping and alloying under nonequilibrium conditions.38 In 2014, Liu et al. developed an ingenious method
and he found an abrupt one-dimensional (1D) interface or a boundary
with the atmospheric-pressure chemical vapor deposition.39 Wei et al. have recently reported the C-doping
of various BN nanostructures, including BN nanotubes, BN nanosheets,
and BNNRs by electron beam irradiation in the presence of solid paraffin
wax as the carbon source with an electron microscope.40 Other researchers also synthesized all kinds of structures.41−43

There are is a lot of experimental progress, but there is
no systematic
work about one-dimensional (1D) CBNNRs (now only 2D triangular graphene
flakes embedded in h-BN37). In this work,
we discuss 1D superlattices where carbon atom-formed nanoflakes are
embedded in the BNNRs. In this article, by using the first-principles
method, we investigate the geometric, electronic, and magnetic properties
of both armchair and zigzag CBNNRs under a transverse E-field. We study electronic and magnetic properties using the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof
(PBE) functional,44 then further using
the transverse E-field to tune their electronic and
magnetic properties. We find that both zigzag and armchair BNNRs doped
with graphene flakes are typical BMS,45 for the first time, and the states near the Fermi level are mainly
contributed by the carbon atoms. The electronic properties of zigzag
and armchair CBNNRs change from BMS to semiconductor, SGS,46−48 to half-metal49−52 with different transverse E-fields. The band gaps
of zigzag CBNNRs follow a linear relationship with the E-field for the first-order Stark effect,53−55 no matter what
is the width of the CBNNRs, whereas band gap of armchair CBNNRs varies
quadratically for the second-order Stark effect.53−55 The total magnetic
moment (MM) is determined by the size of the graphene flakes.

2 Computational Details
The calculations on the CBNNRs
are performed by using a numerical
radial function basis set DMol3 package56,57 based on the
density functional theory under the generalized gradient approximation
with the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) functional.44 The basis set is adopted on the basis of the
double numerical atomic orbitals augmented by polarization functions,
which are comparable to Gaussian 6-31G** sets. The vacuum space in
the z direction is set as large as 20 Å to avoid
the interactions between the periodic images. The real-space global
cutoff radius is set to 4.3 Å. For geometry optimization, total
energy, and band structure calculations, 20, 60, and 100 Monkhost–Pack k-points58 are adopted to sample
the 1D Brillouin zones, respectively. The calculations used are all
electron ones considering scalar relativistic corrections. As for
the self-consistent electronic structure calculations, the convergence
criterions on the energy and electron density are set to be 1 ×
10–6 au (1 Hartree = 1 au = 27.21 eV). Geometry
optimizations are performed with convergence criteria of 1 ×
10–3 au/Å on the gradient, 5 × 10–3 Å on the displacement, and 1 × 10–5 au on the total energy. The h-BN and BNNRs are used as testing systems
to check the accuracy of our procedure. The B–N bond length
in h-BN is calculated to be 1.45 Å, which is consistent with
the experimental measured value.5,7 The calculated band
gaps of 18-zBNNR and 18-aBNNR are 3.72 and 4.53 eV, respectively,
which also agree well with the previous results.59 The dipole correction is considered in the following calculation.
The transverse electric field in a supercell is simulated with a periodic
saw tooth-type potential, which is homogeneous along the ribbon edges,
perpendicular to the ribbon edge. BNNR has two kinds of sublattice
named α and β lattice, seen at the position of B and N
atoms, respectively. In this research, some of the boron or nitrogen
atoms are replaced by the carbon atoms with triangular geometry. Monolayer
graphene could work as a candidate for doping h-BN, as h-BN and graphene
have quite similar bond lengths and  geometries (planar hexagonal
geometry).10

3 Results
and Discussion
3.1 Geometry of the CBNNRs
We first optimize
the geometry of CBNNRs, as shown in Figure 1a,b, respectively. The corresponding optimized
lattice parameter along a periodic direction of the zigzag nanoribbon
is b = 12.586 Å, whereas this value is b = 13.075 Å for the armchair nanoribbon. Following
a routine, we use the following notations: CB (CN) means that one
B (N) atom is substituted with one C atom; C3B1N means
that a triangular graphene flake is formed by substituting 3 B atoms
and 1 N atom with 4 C atoms, as illustrated in Figure 1. (1) T1-CαBβN (α
> β) and (2) T2-CαBβN (α <
β);
here, two triangular graphene flakes with the same size are introduced
into BNNRs through different embedding patterns, as shown in Figure 1a,b, respectively.
For Figure 1a, there
are 4 and 9 C atoms in the triangle graphene flake-doped BNNR, denoted
as T1-C3B1N (blue triangle) and T1-C6B3N (red
triangle), respectively. For Figure 1b, there are 4 and 9 C atoms in the triangle graphene
flake-doped BNNR, denoted as T2-C1B3N (blue triangle),
T2-C3B6N (red triangle), respectively.

CBNNRs. Optimized geometry of (a) T1-C3B1N and T1-C6B3N zigzag CBNNRs and (b) T2-C1B3N and T2-C3B6N armchair CBNNRs, respectively. The red and blue balls
present boron and nitrogen atoms, respectively. The positive direction
of the E-field is denoted by a red arrow, shown in
(a) and (b) for subsequent discussions.

3.2 Electronic Structure of Zigzag and Armchair
CBNNRs
In the above section, we have optimized the geometry
of the zCBNNRs and we now focus on the electronic properties. The
band structure and density of states (DOS) of 6-T1-C3B1N-6 and 6-T2-C1B3N-6 zCBNNRs are calculated by the PBE
functional, shown in Figure 2a–d, respectively. From the band structure, we can
find that 6-T1-C3B1N-6 zCBNNR is an indirect band gap semiconductor.
The doped carbon flake tunes the BNNRs from a semiconductor of wide
band gap of 4.7 eV to a semiconductor with a smaller band gap of 0.70
eV. The valence band maximum (VBM) is located at X point, whereas the conduction band minimum (CBM) is located at Γ
point, in the irreducible Brillouin zone, indicating that the electrons
could not be directly photoexcited from the VBM to the CBM. For 6-T1-C3B1N-6 zCBNNR, the occupied states near the Fermi level are
mainly contributed by spin-α electrons whereas the unoccupied
states near the Fermi level are mainly contributed by spin-β
electrons, whereas for 6-T2-C1B3N-6 zCBNNR, the occupied
states near the Fermi level are mainly contributed by spin-β
electrons and unoccupied states near the Fermi level are mainly contributed
by spin-α electrons. This means they are all typical BMS. Compared
with original BNNRs, the band gap of CBNNRs is obviously decreased.
To notify the reason of the reduction of the band gaps, we calculate
the projected partial density of the states (PDOS) of 6-T1-C3B1N-6, shown in Figure 2b. From PDOS, we can find that the states near the Fermi level are
mainly contributed by four carbon atoms. This is similar with the
BN nanotubes doped with carbon atoms.52,60 For further
analysis, there is an obvious hybridization (main pz orbital hybridization) between carbon atoms and connected
B or N atoms at the interface of carbon atoms.60 The impurity states introduced by the carbon atoms lie
in the original forbidden band gap.60 So
the band gap of the CBNNRs is obviously deceased. From the band structures
and PDOS, the electronic properties of BNNRs are retained. From the
wave function of spatial distributions of the VBM at Γ point
and CBM at X point, the wave functions mainly localize
near the carbon flakes whereas these waves functions delocalize in
the nondoped perfect BNNRs.60 And the distribution
of the wave function is usually related with the chemical reaction
active cites. This means that the chemical reaction active sites change
to the doped carbon atoms after doping.

and β-spin electrons, respectively. PDOS of (b) 6-T1-C3B1N-6 and (d) 6-T2-C1B3N-6 CBNNRs. The black, red, blue,
and green lines present the total DOS of all atoms, and partial DOS
of the C, B, and N atoms, respectively. Here, the spatial distributions
of the VBM and CBM at the Γ point for the 6-T1-C3B1N-6 system are plotted in the panel of (a) and for the 6-T2-C1B3N-6 system are plotted in the panel of (c). Here, the isovalue
is set as 0.06 e/Å3.

In the above section, the zCBNNRs are typical BMS. What about
the
aCBNNRs? In this section, we research the electronic properties of
aCBNNRs. First, armchair BN nanoribbons (aBNNRs) doped with graphene
flakes with smaller size (3 boron and 1 nitrogen atom are replaced
with 4 carbon atoms) are calculated. The band structure and PDOS of
8-T1-C3B1N-8 and 8-T2-C1B3N-8 aCBNNRs are calculated,
presented in Figure 3a–d, respectively. For 8-T1-C3B1N-8, the states
near the Fermi level are constituted by the different spin electrons:
the VBM is contributed by spin-α electron, whereas the CBM is
contributed by spin-β electron. So 8-T1-C3B1N-8 is
also BMS. From Figure 3a, we can get the corresponding Δ1, Δ2, and Δ3
as 0.75, 3.01, and 0.69 eV, respectively. When the triangular graphene
flake is embedded in the aBNNRs, it also introduces the spin-polarized
states into the original forbidden gap and this changes the wide band
gap insulator to a fully spin-polarized narrow band gap semiconductor.
To clarify the contribution of these states, the PDOS is also calculated,
as shown in Figure 3b,d, respectively. From the PDOS, the states near the Fermi levels
are mainly contributed by the carbon atoms, as shown in Figure 3b, and there is also an obvious
hybridization between carbon atoms and nitrogen (T1) atoms, respectively.
This hybridized state is mainly contributed by the pz orbital. The wave functions of the VBM and CBM at Γ
point also locate at the carbon flakes, which means that the chemically
active sites are also transferred to the carbon atoms. This is consistent
with the analysis of the PDOS. The band structure and PDOS of 8-T2-C1B3N-8 aCBNNR are shown in Figure 3c,d, respectively. The band structures imply
that it is also BMS, and the corresponding Δ1, Δ2, and
Δ3 are 0.75, 0.65, and 3.03 eV, respectively. The states near
the Fermi level are still contributed by the carbon atoms. The distributions
of the wave function agree well with PDOS analysis. The VBM and CBM
of 8-T1-C3B1N-8 and 8-T2-C1B3N-8 aCBNNRs mainly
localize at the carbon atoms.

and green lines present the total and partial DOS of all atoms and
the C, B, and N atoms, respectively. Here, the spatial distributions
of the VBM (bottom) and CBM (top) at the Γ point for the 8-T1-C3B1N-8 system are plotted in the panel of (a) and for the 8-T2-C1B3N-8 system are plotted in the panel of (c). Here, the isovalue
is 0.06 e/Å3.

3.3 Transverse E-Field-Tuned
Electronic Properties
The BMS could be tuned into a spin
filter by a carrier,52 a transverse E-field,61,62 and by applying a gate voltage45,63 in previous investigations. To clearly illustrate the similar results
observed in these triangular graphene flake-doped BNNRs, we take T1-C3B1N and T2-C1B3N as examples. The band gap of the
6-T1-C3B1N-6 zCBNNR is 0.70 eV, and corresponding Δ1,
Δ2, and Δ3 are 0.70, 2.95, and 0.26 eV, respectively.
Compared with Δ3, Δ1 and Δ2 are quite big, which
can insure the stability of the half-metallicity under the transverse E-field or chemical function, whereas Δ1, Δ2,
and Δ3 of 6-T1-C3B1N-6 are 0.73, 0.44, and 2.77 eV,
respectively. Considering that these structures are BMS with smaller
band gaps means that Δ1 is quite small. And the E-field could tune the electronic properties of BN nanoribbons64 and nanotubes.54,65−68 So it is necessary to consider using the E-field
to tune the electronic properties of zigzag and armchair CBN nanoribbons
with smaller band gaps. First, the DOS of 6-T1-C3B1N-6
zCBNNRs under different transverse E-fields is calculated
and the corresponding result is shown in Figure 4. Figure 4a–d shows the DOS of the E-field
= 0.02, 0.06, 0.12, and 0.16 V/Å, respectively. As the E-field increases, the corresponding band gap monotonously
decreases. For the E-field equal to 0, the corresponding
gap is 0.70 eV whereas when the E-field is increased
to 0.02 and 0.06 V/Å, the corresponding gap decreases to 0.65
and 0.35 eV, respectively. When the E-field is increased
to 0.12 V/Å, the corresponding gap is 0 eV. So it transforms
into a metal. When the E-field is further increased
to 0.16 V/Å, it transfers into a semiconductor with a band gap
of 0.44 eV; the PDOS is shown in Figure 4d. For 6-T2-C1B3N-6 zCBNNRs, the
band gap is 0.76 eV without an E-field. When the
transverse E-field is increased to 0.02 and 0.06
V/Å, the corresponding gap is 0.63 and 0.38 eV, shown in Figure 4e,f, respectively.
As the E-field goes on increasing to 0.10 and 0.12
V/Å, the corresponding band gaps are 0 and 0 eV, shown in Figure 4g,h, respectively.
This means that as the E-field increases, the band
gap monotonously decreases and the system even transfers from semiconductor
to metal under a stronger transverse E-field. Compared
with perfect zigzag BNNRs, the transverse E-field
could more effectively tune the zCBNNRs: under quite a small E-field, the energy gap could be more efficiently modulated.

Figure 4 (a–h)
DOS of 6-T1(2)-CmBnN-6 zCBNNRs varies with
the E-field, ranging from 0.02 to 0.16 eV/Å.
The DOS of 6-T1-C3B1N-6 with the E-field
equal to (a) 0.02 eV/Å, (b) 0.06 eV/Å, (c) 0.12 eV/Å,
and (d) 0.16 eV/Å, respectively. The DOS of 6-T2-C1B3N-6 with the E-field of (a) 0.02 eV/Å, (b) 0.06
eV/Å, (c) 0.12 eV/Å, and (d) 0.16 eV/Å, respectively.
The spin density distribution of 6-T1-C3B1N-6 zCBNNR under
the E-field of (a) 0.02 eV/Å and (b) 0.12 eV/Å
is shown in the inset of (a) and (c), respectively. The spin density
distribution of 6-T2-C1B3N-6 under the E-field of (e) 0.02 eV/Å and (g) 0.12 V/Å, respectively.
Here, the isovalue is 0.08 e/Å3.

In the following part, the electronic properties of the ribbon
with increased size of the graphene flakes are also investigated.
The DOS of 6-T1-C6B3N-5 zCBNNR under an E-field of 0.02, 0.06, 0.10, 0.12, and 0.16 V/Å is calculated,
and the corresponding gaps are 0.46, 0.14, 0, 0, and 0 eV, shown in Figure 5a–e, respectively.
As the strength of the E-field goes on increasing,
the unoccupied states of the spin-β electrons are shifted down
near the Fermi level. When the E-field is increased
to 0.10 V/Å, the original unoccupied states of the spin-β
electrons are shifted to the Fermi level and become partially occupied.
So 6-T1-C6B3N-5 zCBNNR shows half-metallicity. As the E-field goes on increasing to 0.12 V/Å, the fully occupied
state of spin-β electrons is shifted upward and becomes partially
occupied. So 6-T1-C6B3N-5 becomes a common spin-polarized
metal. When the E-field equals 0.16 V/Å, the
original partial occupied states of spin-α electrons shift upward
and become unoccupied, whereas the original occupied states of spin-β
are still occupied. So 6-T1-C6B3N-5 becomes a half-metal,
conducting with the spin-β channel. In other words, the E-field could tune 6-T1-C6B3N-5 from BMS into
a half-metal used for spin filtering, conducting with either the spin-α
or the spin-β channel.

Figure 5 (a–e) DOS of 6-T1-C6B3N-5
zCBNNRs with different E-fields is calculated by
the PBE, with (a) 0.02 V/Å,
(b) 0.06 V/Å, (c) 0.10 V/Å, (d) 0.12 V/Å, and (e) 0.16
V/Å, respectively. (f) The band gaps of T1-CαBβN zCBNNRs change with the E-field. The black
line with triangles, the red line with circles, the gray line with
upward triangles, the blue line with downward triangles, the green
line with diamonds, and the light blue line with five-pointed stars
present 6-C3B1N-6, 6-C1B3N-6, 10-C3B1N-10, 10-C1B3N-10, 6-C3B6N-5, and 5-C6B3N-6 zCBNNRs, respectively.

The electronic properties of the CBNNRs are usually related
with
the position of the carbon flakes, and this condition is similar with
the line defect in the graphene nanoribbon.52 So it is quite necessary to research the effect of positon of the
carbon flake on the electronic properties of CBNNRs under the transverse E-field. The DOSs of M-T1-C3B1N-N (M + N = 12,
M = 11, 9, 7, 6) 11-T1-C3B1N-1, 9-T1-C3B1N-3,
7-T1-C3B1N-5, and 6-T1-C3B1N-6 zCBNNRs under
the E-field of 0.06 V/Å are shown in Figure 6a–d, respectively.
For 11-T1-C3B1N-1 without an E-field,
the band gap is 0.16 eV. This system is transferred into half-metal
under an E-field of 0.06 V/Å. 9-T1-C3B1N-3 is a BMS with a reduced band gap of 0.60 eV, shown in Figure 6b. 7-T1-C3B1N-5 is a BMS with a reduced band gap of 0.60 eV. 6-T1-C3B1N-6 is still a BMS with a reduced band gap of 0.20 eV. When the size
of the carbon flakes is further increased, the DOS of M-T1-C6B3N-N (M + N = 18) under the E-field of 0.06 V/Å
with M equal to 1, 3, 5, and 7 is shown in Figure 6e–h, respectively. From Figure 6, we can find that for M =
1, 3, and 5, the corresponding aCBNNRs are all half-metal with the
spin-α channel conducting whereas the spin-β channel is
insulating with band gaps of 2.80, 2.82, and 2.85 eV, respectively,
whereas for M = 7, it corresponds to 7-T1-C6B3N-11 zCBNNRs,
which is still a semiconductor with a band gap of 0.16 eV. In other
words, the position of the carbon flakes has an obvious effect on
electronic properties, especially under the same strength of the E-field. Because the electronic properties are closely related
with the VBM and CBM for the original BNNRs and different positions
of the carbon flakes also affect the position of the doping states,
VBM and CBM, which are determined by the carbon atoms.

Figure 6 (a–h) DOS of M-T1-C3B1N-N and M-T1-C6B3N-N aCBNNRs (M + N = 12, M =
11, 9, 7, 6), respectively, under the E-field of
−0.06 V/Å. (a–d) The DOS of
M-T1-C3B1N-N (M + N = 12) with M equals to (a) 11, (b)
9, (c) 7, and (d) 6, respectively. (e–h) The DOS of M-T1-C6B3N-N (M + N = 18) with M equals to (e) 1, (f) 3, (g) 5, and
(h) 7, respectively. (i) The evolution of the band gaps of armchair
CBNNRs as a function of the external E-field. The
green solid and hollow circles, the red solid and hollow diamonds,
the blue solid and hollow rectangles, and the black solid and hollow
triangles denote 10-C1B3N-10, 10-C3B1N-10, 9-C3B6N-9, 9-C6B3N-9, 8-C3B1N-8, 8-C1B3N-8, 7-C3B6N-7, and 7-C6B3N-7 aCBNNRs,
respectively.

aCBNNRs with different
widths, patterns, and sizes of the graphene
flakes under different transverse E-fields are also
calculated, and the results are shown in Figure 6. For M-T1-C3B1N-M and N-T2-C1B3N-N aCBNNRs, the energy gap varies quadratically with the
transverse E-field. M = 8, 9, and 10 are calculated.
We first take M = 8 as an example, and the corresponding geometries
are 8-T1-C3B1N-8 and 8-T2-C1B3N-8, respectively.
The band gap and the transverse E-field follow the
relationship: y = 0.78 + 7.70x +
8.55x2 (T1) and y = 0.77
+ 5.75x – 12.92x2 (T2). For much wider CBNNRs, such as 10-T1-C3B1N-10 and
10-T2-C1B3N-10, the band gap and transverse E-field follow the relationship: y = 0.77 + 6.25x – 6.70x2 and y = 0.80 + 7.61x + 11.80x2. When the bigger sized carbon flakes with a triangular
shape replace the boron and nitrogen atoms, i.e., 9 carbon atoms replace
6 boron and 3 nitrogen atoms, they correspond to T1-C6B3N aCBNNRs. For 7-T1-C6B3N-7 and 7-T2-C3B6N-7,
the band gap and transverse E-field follow the relationship: y = 0.50 + 3.84x – 32.58x2 and y = 0.44 + 2.54x – 56.43x2. For much
wider CBNNRs, such as 9-T1-C6B3N-9 and 9-T2-C3B6N-9, the band gap and transverse E-field follow the
relationship: y = 0.52 + 4.77x –
23.26x2 and y = 0.43
+ 1.71x – 64.94x2. For the same E-field, such as −0.02 V/Å,
the gap of 10-C1B3N-10, 10-C3B1N-10, 9-C3B6N-9, 9-C6B3N-9, 8-C3B1N-8, 8-C1B3N-8 7-C3B6N-7, and 7-C6B3N-7 CBNNRs
is 0.664, 0.653, 0.383, 0.438, 0.624, 0.632, 0.379, and 0.424 eV,
respectively. When the E-field is increased to −0.04
V/Å, the corresponding gap is 0.517, 0.515, 0.245, 0.298, 0.498,
0.527, 0.248, and 0.302 eV, respectively. For the E-field-0.7 V/Å, the corresponding gap is 0.328, 0.288, 0.071,
0.300, 0.272, 0.298, 0, and 0.068 eV, respectively. For the same E-field, the CBNNRs doped with bigger size of carbon flakes
show smaller band gaps and the E-field shows a more
obvious modulation effect.

Other CBNNRs with different size
of graphene flakes are also systematically
investigated, and the quadratic function relation still works for
the second Stark effect. In the above section, the electronic properties
under a weaker E-field have been investigated. What
will happen when the transverse E-field goes on increasing?
Could stronger E-field modulate the BMSs into SGSs
or half-metal? To solve these questions, the electronic properties
of 7-T1-C6B3N-7 and 9-T1-C6B3N-9 aCBNNRs under
the stronger E-field are also investigated and the
corresponding results are shown in Figure 7a,b, respectively. When the E-field is in the range (0, 0.08) V/Å, the band gap and E-field still follow quadratic function relation. When the E-field is in the range (0.08, 0.09), the CBNNRs are changed
into spin-polarized metal. When the E-field equals
to 0.10 V/Å, the system is SGS. When the E-field
is in the range (0.11, 0.16) V/Å, the corresponding system is
half-metal. In other words, 7-T1-C6B3N-7 undergoes transformation
from BMS, into metal, SGS, even half-metal, as the E-field goes on increasing. For much wider 9-T1-C6B3N-9
aCBNNRs, it changes into SGS with an E-field = 0.08–0.09
V/Å. When the E-field goes on increasing, it
transfers into half-metal. So the transverse E-field
could efficiently modulate the electronic properties of zigzag and
armchair CBNNRs.

as a function
of the external E-field. The regions labeled I–IV
are in the semiconductor range, metal range, SGS range, and half-metal
range, respectively.

3.4 Magnetic Properties
In this part,
the magnetic properties of zCBNNRs and aCBNNRs are investigated. T1-C3B1N and T2-C1B3N CBNNRs have 2.00 μB net magnetic moment (MM). The magnetic moment is mainly contributed
by the carbon atoms and nearby connected B (T2) or N (T1) atoms, and
more detail can be found in the Supporting Information. Taking 6-T1-C3B1N-6 zigzag and 8-T2-C3B6N-8 armchair CBNNRs as examples, we analyze the distribution of the
magnetic moments. The carbon atoms contribute most magnetic moments
to the whole system. The central carbon atom has 0.03 μB MM, whereas each of the three carbon atoms at the vertex
of the triangle  has 0.38 μB MM, and each
nearby boron atom connected to the carbon atoms has 0.07 μB MM, shown in the Supporting Information. The MM is also investigated when more carbon atoms are doped into
the BNNRs, such as 8-T2-C3B6N-8 aCBNNR. It has 3.00 μB MM. Each carbon atom at the vertex of the triangle contributes
0.35 μB MM, and each carbon atom at the middle edge
of a triangle contributes 0.26 μB MM, whereas other
carbon atoms make little contribution, only 0.02 μB MM. And the common CBNNRs with bigger size of carbon flakes, such
as T1-C6B3N or T2-C3B6N, have 3.00 μB MM. The carbon atoms of the same sublattice have the same
spin. For T1-C6B3N, six boron atom sites replaced with
carbon atoms have the same spin (α) whereas three nitrogen atom
sites replaced with carbon atoms show another spin (β). This
means that carbon atoms belonging to the same sublattice ferromagnetically
couple with the other whereas the carbon atoms belonging to the different
sublattice antiferromagnetically couple with each other. This is similar
to the graphene nanoribbons.48 For T1 configuration,
α – β is negative, whereas for T2, α –
β is positive. For T1-T2-CαBβN CBNNRs,
|α – β| electrons or holes could be introduced
and they have |α – β| μB MM, shown
in Figure 8. The magnetic
properties of CBNNRs could be precisely controlled by changing the
size of the graphene flakes, which are doped in the BNNRs. The above
predicted metal-free ferromagnetism originates from the pure 2p electrons.
This ferromagnetism doesn’t come from the usual 3d electrons
(corresponding to the d electron magnetism), so it is named d0 magnetism. Compared with the magnetic system of any transition
metal, it has a dominant advantage for spintronics since these 2p
electron systems have relatively long spin relaxation times due to
the weak spin–orbit coupling.69 Thus,
the BNNRs doped with triangular graphene flakes with tunable metal-free
magnetism are promising for applications in spintronic devices.

Figure 8 Magnetic moments
of considered systems vary with α –
β. The left inset shows the spin density distribution of 8-T2-C3B6N-8 aCBNNRs, and the right inset shows the spin density
distribution of 6-T1-C3B1N-6 zCBNNRs, respectively. Here,
the isovalue is 0.08 e/Å3.

The transverse E-field could also tune magnetic
properties of low-dimensional materials,70 and the corresponding results are shown in the inset of Figure 4a,c,e,g, respectively.
For a weaker E-field with 0.02 V/Å, the CBNNRs
still show a spin-polarized ferromagnetic ground state and both 6-T1-C3B1N-6 and 6-T2-C1B3N-6 sill have a 2.00 μB MM, shown in the inset of Figure 4a,b, respectively. When the E-field gets as much as 0.12 V/Å, the transverse E-field fully suppresses the spin-polarization and 6-T1-C3B1N-6 and 6-T2-C1B3N-6 show a spin-unpolarized ground state
and the total magnetic moment equals 0 μB, shown
in the inset of Figure 4c,g, respectively.

3.5 Stability of CBN Nanoribbons
We further
perform ab initio molecular dynamic (AIMD) simulations, to examine
whether CBNNR is stable and whether the magnetic state could survive
at room temperature (300 K). The total simulated time of one trajectory
is 10 ps. As an example, we calculate the fluctuation of total energy
of 6-T1-C3B1N-6 and 6-T2-C1B3N-6 zCBNNR, shown
in Figure 9a,b, respectively.
The results indicate that 6-T1-C3B1N-6 and 6-T2-C1B3N-6 zCBNNR are stable at room temperature. During the simulation,
the ribbon maintains the planar geometry without obvious distortion.
This is caused by the binding energies of the C–B (393 kJ/mol),
C–N (305 kJ/mol), and C–C (332 kJ/mol) bonds being much
larger than the thermal energy at room temperature. Similar results
were also observed in the case of CBN nanotubes.60 The total energy oscillates around −795.366 eV during
10 ps, with the amplitude being about 0.015 eV per atom for 6-T1-C3B1N-6, whereas for 6-T2-C1B3N-6, the total energy
oscillates around −890.323 eV, with the amplitude being about
0.016 eV per atom. We also check the snapshots of the geometries during
the simulated time, and the geometries still remain planar, without
obvious distortion in the stronger chemical bonding. For T1-C3B1N and T2-C1B3N, the total magnetic moments remain
at nearly 2.00 μB during the simulated time, without
obvious change, and the total magnetic moments remain nearly 3.00
μB during the simulated time for T1-C6B3N and T2-C3B6N zCBNNRs.

4 Conclusions
In conclusion, we examine
the geometry and electronic and magnetic
properties of CBNNRs with first-principles calculations. The triangular
graphene flakes are embedded in BNNRs, and the corresponding CBNNRs
become BMSs. The transverse E-field could effectively
tune the electronic properties: the gaps of zCBNNRs change linearly
with the transverse E-field for the first-order Stark
effect, whereas for aCBNNRs, the gap change varies quadratically with
the electric fields for the second-order Stark effect. The transverse E-field could tune zCBNNRs and aCBNNRs from BMS to SGS or
half-metal. The position of the graphene flakes has an effect on the
electronic properties under the same E-field. The
carbon atoms also introduce local magnetic moments, which are determined
by the size of the carbon flakes. Finally, the structural and magnetic
stability at room temperature are confirmed by AIMD. Our work offers
a feasible strategy to design and modulate carbon, boron, and nitrogen
nanostructures with different properties for nanoelectronic and spintronic
applications.
