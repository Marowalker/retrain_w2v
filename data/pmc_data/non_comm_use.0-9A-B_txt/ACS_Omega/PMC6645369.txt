Anilines are one
of the important chemical feedstocks and are utilized
for the preparation of a variety of pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals,
pigments, and dyes. In this context, the catalytic reduction of nitro
functionality is an industrially vital process for the synthesis of
aniline derivatives. Herein, we report an efficient nanosized bimetallic
Pd–Au/TiO2 nanomaterial which is proved to be quite
efficient for rapid catalytic hydrogen transfer reduction of nitroarenes
into corresponding amines. Significantly, the reduction process is
successful under solvent-free and mild green atmospheric conditions.
Bimetallic Pd–Au nanoparticles served as the active center,
and TiO2 played as a support in hydrogen transfer from
the source hydrazine monohydrate. Typical results highlighted that
the reactions were very rapid and the products were obtained in good
to excellent yields. Significantly, the process was successful in
the presence of a very low amount catalyst (0.1 mol %). Furthermore,
the reaction showed good chemoselectivity and compatiblity with double
or triple bond, aldehyde, ketone, and ester functionalities on the
aromatic ring. Typical results indicated the true heterogeneous nature
of the Pd–Au/TiO2 nanocatalyst, where the catalyst
retained the activity, without loss of its activity.

Introduction
Development of a green
protocol for organic transformations is
a great challenge to the synthetic community. A catalyst is a necessary
element of any sustainable development.1 In this context, development of stable, highly active, recyclable,
and environmentally benign catalysts is highly desirable. Nanomaterial-based
catalysts act as viaducts between homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts
and promote the advantages, namely, selectivity and recyclability.2,3 Therefore, nanocatalysts play an important role in the development
of sustainable processes.4,5 Noble metal-containing
nanomaterials have attracted a significant consideration because of
their unique physicochemical properties, which exhibit versatile applications
in organic transformations.6−8 It is desirable to have high dispersion
of noble metals such as Pd, Au, Pt, and so forth, which is an important
issue in the field of heterogeneous catalysis.9 Bimetallic nanomaterials have recently attracted an extensive consideration
because of their enhanced catalytic properties when compared to monometallic
nanoparticles for several catalytic reactions.10−21

Reduction of nitroarenes to the corresponding aniline derivatives
is essential for various industrial applications such as the preparation
of pharmaceuticals, pigments, agrochemicals, dyestuffs, and polymers.22−24 The environmentally benign and selective reduction of the nitro
group with other easily reducible groups (double or triple bonds and
carbonyl groups) of aromatic derivatives is a challenge. Heterogeneous
catalytic reduction of nitroarenes is rather preferred with regard
to high yields and selectivity over traditional metal-mediated reductions
(iron, zinc, and tin).25 In addition, heterogeneous
catalytic reduction of nitroarenes, particularly, working under ligand
and solvent-free and at milder reaction conditions is advantageous
than those that make use of high pressure reactors of hydrogen gas,26,27 toxic organic solvents, ligands, and high temperatures.24,28 The catalytic reduction of nitroarenes mediated by homogeneous transition-metal
catalysts has also been well-established (i.e. Pd,29,30 Ru,31 Rh,32 Ir,33 and Ni34). However, the main limitation of homogeneous catalysts is recyclability
and reusability, whereas the commercially available heterogeneous
catalysts (Pd/C) are less efficient because a high amount of noble
metals is required.35 However, the separation
of nanocatalysts is difficult because of its small size.36,37 To overcome this problem, nanoparticles supported on high surface
area materials is often practiced. To the best of our knowledge, a
few reports are accessible for the combination of bimetallic metals
and metal oxide supports for nitroarenes reduction reactions.16,17

Herein, we report a highly active bimetallic Pd–Au
supported
by a TiO2 heterogeneous catalyst, which exhibits higher
activity on the reduction of nitroarenes into anilines. The catalytic
activity of bimetallic Pd–Au/TiO2 has been studied
on hydrogenation of nitroarenes under mild and solvent-free green
atmospheric conditions. The efficacy of the developed Pd–Au/TiO2 catalyst has been confirmed by comparing with monometallic
Pd/TiO2 and Au/TiO2 catalysts. In addition,
chemoselectivity and recyclability of the Pd–Au/TiO2 catalyst has also been examined.

Results and Discussion
Synthesis
of TiO2-Supported Pd Nanoparticles
A mixture of
PdCl2 (0.56 mmol, 100 mg) and NaCl (1.5 mmol,
88 mg) was taken in 10 mL of methanol and stirred continuously for
24 h at room temperature. It was then diluted with 40 mL of methanol
and stirred for 5 min at room temperature, and TiO2 nanoparticles
(6.26 mmol, 500 mg) were added into this solution. Further, the resultant
mixture was stirred continuously for 1 h at 60 °C. Finally, the
reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature, and sodium acetate
(9.26 mmol, 0.76 g) and 0.5 mL of hydrazine monohydrate were added
to into the mixture and stirred for 1 h. At the end, the mixture was
centrifuged with methanol, water, and acetone. It was kept in the
oven for drying, followed by grinding to obtain a fine powder.

Characterization of As-Prepared Catalysts
X-ray Diffraction (XRD)
The powder XRD patterns of
pure TiO2, Pd/TiO2, and Pd–Au/TiO2 are shown in Figure 1, which confirmed the formation of the catalysts. By using
the JCPDS no.: 89–4921 (TiO2), 89–4897 (Pd),
and 89–3697 (Au), the presence of the active components is
identified. The diffraction peaks of pure TiO2 showed d-spacing values of 3.509, 2.426, 2.375, 2.328, 1.888, 1.697,
1.662, 1.490, and 1.478 Å representing (101), (103), (004), (112),
(200), (105), (211), (204), and (116) crystalline planes, respectively.38−40 In a similar manner, the peaks of Pd showed d-spacing
values of 2.245, 1.948, 1.375, and 1.663 Å corresponding to (111),
(200), (220), and (311) crystalline planes, respectively, and the
peaks of Au showed d-spacing values of 2.339, 1.939, 1.439, 1.229,
and 1.164 Å representing (111), (200), (220), (311), and (222)
crystalline planes, respectively.41−43

Raman Analysis
The Raman spectra of TiO2, Pd/TiO2, and Pd–Au/TiO2 indicated
Eg, B1g, and A1g peaks. The Eg peak is due to the symmetrical stretching vibrations of O–Ti–O,
whereas the B1g peak is due to the symmetrical bending
vibrations of O–Ti–O and the A1g peak is
due to asymmetric bending vibrations of O–Ti–O in the
TiO2 nanoparticles. In Figure 2, fresh TiO2 has five Raman active
modes in the vibrational spectrum centered at 143, 196, 395, 514,
and 636 cm–1, which are assigned to the Eg, Eg, B1g, A1g, and Eg symmetries of the anatase phase of TiO2.44,45 Pd impregnated on TiO2 showed Raman vibrational modes
centered at 152, 205, 237, 268, 330, 401, 562, 617, and 692 cm–1 because of A1g, B1g, A1g, B3g, B1g, A1g, B3g, A1g, and Ag symmetries of the Brookite phase
of Pd/TiO2, respectively,46−55 whereas Pd–Au-impregnated TiO2 showed the Raman
vibrational modes at 149, 264, 401, and 601 cm–1 corresponding to the B1g and two phonon scattering Eg and A1g modes of the rutile phase of Pd–Au/TiO2, respectively.56,57 The phase transformation
of TiO2 in Pd/TiO2 and Pd–Au/TiO2 is due to the presence of NaCl and NaOAc in the synthesis,
which favors the anatase–brookite and anatase–rutile
phases of TiO2. With the introduction of NaCl and NaOAc,
the Na+ ions locally stops the direct closure of titanate
layers at their adjacent positions, which induces the brookite- and
rutile-like structures.58,59

XPS Analysis
The
valence states of the Pd–Au/TiO2 nanocatalyst were
analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS). The XPS spectra shown in Figure 3 show the characteristic Pd 3d5/2and Pd
3d3/2 peaks at 339.6 and 335.7 eV, respectively, corresponding
to Pd(0).60 The XPS core level spectra
of the Au 4f are shown in Figure 3. The binding energies (BEs) of Au 4f7/2 and Au 4f5/2 electrons are 83.2 and 86.8 eV, respectively.
It is reliable with the reports on gold metal, which indicate that
in Pd–Au/TiO2, Au exists in the metallic state (Au(0)).61 The valance state of nonstoichiometric TiO2 in Pd–Au/TiO2 was confirmed by XPS analysis
of Ti 2p and O 1s peaks coupled with Lorentzian fits shown in Figure 3.62 The peaks centered at 457.3 and 458.4 eV are due to Ti2O3 and TiO2 species, respectively.61,63 This is also supported by the deconvoluted O 1s spectrum, which
revealed the BE of the individual Ti(III) at 531.8 eV (Ti+3–O) and Ti(IV) at 529.3 eV (Ti+4–O).64

Figure 4 shows the morphological
characteristics of Pd–Au nanoparticles on TiO2 nanoparticles.
The average particle size of Pd–Au nanoparticles is 5 nm, and
TiO2 nanoparticles exhibited a wide range of sizes. We
observed from the images that the the particles mostly have spherical
shape.

Catalytic Activity
In an oven-dried
10 mL test tube,
nitroarenes 1 (1 mmol), reductant [hydrazine monohydrate
(0.5 mL)], and Pd–Au/TiO2 nanoparticles (0.1 mol
% of Pd–Au) were added. The resulting neat reaction mixture
was stirred in an open vessel and at room temperature. The progress
of the reaction was monitored by thin-layer chromatography. After
completion of the reaction, the reaction mixture was diluted with
an aqueous NH4Cl solution (approximately 10 mL) and extracted
with ethyl acetate (3 × 3 mL). The organic layers were dried
(Na2SO4) and concentrated under reduced pressure.
Purification of the residue by silica gel column chromatography using
petroleum ether/ethyl acetate as the eluent furnished the corresponding
amines 2, as a solid/viscous yellowish liquid.

Optimization
of the Reaction Conditions
In order to
find out the optimal reaction conditions, the hydrogenation of nitroarenes 1 (1 mmol) in the presence of various catalysts was studied
in various parameters such as the effect of different conditions,
and the results are summarized in Table 1. Initially, the reaction was carried out
on nitrobenzene 1a with hydrazine monohydrate as the
reductant under solvent-free conditions, with different Zn-based mono/bimetallic
catalysts such as ZnO, Zn0.7Mn0.3O2−δ, and Zn0.7Fe0.3O2−δ (Table 1, entries
1–3). However, no progress was noticed except for the recovery
of the starting material. The reaction did not show any progress even
with other metal transition-metal oxides NiFe2O4, CuFe2O4, SnO2, and TiO2 (Table 1, entries
4–7). On the other hand, the reaction with Pd/C furnished aniline 2a in moderate yields (Table 1, entry 8). Notably, the reduction reaction in the
presence of Pd/TiO2 and Au/TiO2 proved to be efficient
and gave product 2a in 82 and 80% yields, respectively,
in shorter reaction times (Table 1, entries 9 & 10). Gratifyingly, the bimetallic
Pd–Au/TiO2 nanocatalyst turned out to be the best
and afforded aniline 2a just in 5 min in excellent yields
under mild and solvent-free open vessel conditions (Table 1, entry 11). The catalytic activity
of the catalyst depends on strong metal–support interaction
(SMSI). The small size metal nanoparticles have more SMSI effect compared
with large size metal nanoparticles.65,66 Therefore,
Pd–Au/TiO2 exhibited high catalytic activity due
to small size of Pd–Au nanoparticles (for particles size see Figure S7).

The reaction was also explored with various solvents,
such as methanol,
ethanol, dichloromethane (DCM), ethyl acetate, and water, as depicted
in Table 2. The protic
solvents such as MeOH and EtOH seemed to be good and furnished 2a in very good yields (Table 2, entries 1 & 2), whereas the solvents DCM and
ethyl acetate were also good (Table 2, entries 3 & 4). Water was also found to be the
useful solvent (Table 2, entry 5). On the other hand, the reaction with other reductants,
such as NaBH4 and H2 balloon, furnished the
product aniline 2a in 76 and 64% yields, respectively
(Table 2, entries 6
& 7).

c Closed vessel with atmospheric pressure.

Further to optimize the reaction with regard to the
amount of hydrazine
monohydrate (N2H4·H2O), for
the formation of aniline 2a, it was planned to carry
out the reduction on nitrobenzene 1a with varying amounts
of N2H4·H2O. Thus, the reaction
was carried out with 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, and 0.5 mL of hydrazine monohydrate
(N2H4·H2O) for 10 min at room
temperature and in an open vessel. However, it was observed that product
yields were less with 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, and 0.4 mL of N2H4·H2O when compared to that of 0.5 mL of N2H4·H2O (Table 3, entries 1–5). Therefore, it was
concluded that Pd–Au/TiO2 (0.1 mol %) and N2H4·H2O (0.5 mL) under the mild
open vessel and solvent-free reaction conditions were best for the
formation of aniline 2a reduction (Table 1, entry 11).

a Reaction conditions: nitrobenzene

b Isolated yields of product 2a.

With these best
conditions in hand (Table 1, entry 11), next, to check the scope and
generality of the method, the hydrogenation reaction was explored
with various nitroarenes 1a–r. Gratifyingly, the
reaction was found to be amenable and afforded the corresponding amines 2a–i, in good to excellent yields (Table 4). Significantly, the reaction
was completed in a reasonably short span of time. Interestingly, the
reaction was successful with simple and methyl-substituted nitrobenzenes 1a–c and furnished the reduced anilines 2a–c in excellent yields (Table 4). However, the reaction with halo-substituted nitrobenzenes 1c–l (i.e. with Cl, Br, and I) not only reduced the
nitro group but also removed the halide moieties reductively and thus
furnished the products 2a–c in good to very good
yields (Table 4). The
reductive removal of halide groups along with the reduction of nitro
functionality is due to the reactive nature of the catalyst. Quite
interestingly, when the chloride/fluoride functionality belongs to
other aromatic of biaryl nitro compound, the reduction was found to
be chemoselective and gave the corresponding biaryl amines without
affecting the halide moiety (Table 4, 2m–n). Though the exact reason
is not certain at this stage on the selective reduction of the nitro
group, however, this could be due to the reason that chloride is farther
away from the nitro group and hence may be relatively less reactive.
Notably, the reaction was compatible with benzylic bromo and hydroxyl
groups (Table 4, 2o–p). In addition, the reaction was also found to
be feasible with nitroanilines 1q–r and yielded
the products 2q–r in good yields (Table 4).

a Reaction conditions: nitrobenzene
(1 mmol), hydrazine monohydrate (0.5 mL), and Pd–Au/TiO2 (0.1 mol % of Pd–Au).

b Isolated yields of product 2a–r.

To further check the compatibility
and applicability of the method,
it was aimed to explore the reduction reaction with other nitroarenes.
Thus, the reaction was performed on aldehyde-, ketone-, ester-, and
double and triple bond-containing nitroarenes 1s–w (Table 5). To our
delight, the method showed excellent compatibility and chemoselectivity
and furnished the corresponding anilines 2s–w without
affecting the aldehyde, ketone, ester, olefin, and alkyne groups (Table 5). Thus, this reveals
the importance of the present protocol.

(1 mmol), hydrazine monohydrate (0.5 mL), and Pd–Au/TiO2 (0.1 mol % of Pd–Au).

b Isolated yields of product 2s–w.

It is worth mentioning that
the catalyst retains its activity,
which is evident with nearly no loss of activity even after the fifth
reaction cycle (Figure 5). This was done by recovering the catalyst by centrifugation and
washing with ethyl acetate and acetone, followed by drying in a hot
air oven at 60 °C for 12 h. The recovered Pd–Au/TiO2 nanocatalyst was then subjected to the next catalytic cycles.
The marginal loss of activity after the fifth cycle (<3%) may be
due to loss of some amount of the catalyst during the recovery of
the Pd–Au/TiO2 nanocatalyst. The catalyst was recycled
five times without an appreciable change in the product 2a yield, under the established conditions. Thus, on the basis of the
above results, it was confirmed that the Pd–Au/TiO2 nanocatalyst is stable enough and can be reused.

Conclusion
In summary, we did a comparative study with
as-synthesized various
nanomaterials among all the catalysts and bimetallic Pd–Au
nanoparticles impregnated on TiO2 were found to exhibit
excellent catalytic activity for various nitroarenes rapid hydrogenation
reactions. On the other hand, this catalyst exhibits chemoselective
nitroarenes hydrogenation under green atmospheric conditions. The
Pd–Au/TiO2 catalyst could be reused several times
without any loss of activity. Typical results indicated the heterogeneous
nature of the catalyst with good reusability.

Experimental Section
Instruments
Used
Structural characterization of the
catalyst was done on PANalytical, X’pertPRO with Cu Kα-radiation.
Raman spectroscopy also corroborated the various phases of TiO2 and thus the confirmation of various phases of TiO2 was done by using Raman spectroscopy. Raman spectroscopy is analyzed
in the Raman shift ranging from 70 to 900 cm–1 at
the excitation line of 532 nm at room temperature. The oxidation state
and the elemental composition of the as-prepared catalyst were confirmed
by XPS with a Kratos axis ultra-spectrometer with an Al Kα source
at 1498.5 eV, by fixing the emission current and applied a voltage
at 10 mA and 15 kV. The weight percentages of metals in the catalysts
were confirmed by X-ray fluorescence spectrometry and energy-dispersive
X-ray spectroscopy. High-resolution TEM was performed by using a JEOL
JEM 2100FX TEM instrument. 1H & 13C NMR
spectra were recorded using a Bruker AVANCE instrument 400 & 100
MHz, respectively.
