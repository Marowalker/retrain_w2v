The
relaxation mechanism of electronically excited states of host–guest complexes
between cucurbiturils (CB) and pyridinium styryl dyes is considered
in detail on the basis of the recent results obtained by the up-conversion
fluorescence technique. The addition of CB to aqueous dye solutions
increases the longest fluorescence decay times from about 50 ps for
the free dyes to 100–150 ps for the bound ones. This is attributed
to the braking of intramolecular rotations around the single bonds
of the styryl moiety that is provided by guest’s displacement
inside the cavity, whose driving force is a Coulombic interaction
of the styryl dye cation and negatively charged CB portals. This displacement,
a translational movement along the CB axis, is associated with the
observed decay time of about 1 ps. There is also a characteristic
time of about 100 fs, attributed to vibrational relaxation. In fact,
such complexes can operate as a molecular machine, the molecular switch.

Introduction
Since the beginning of this century, there
has been a significant
increase in publications on physical chemistry of cucurbit[n]urils (CB[n]), macrocyclic cavitands
that consist of n glicoluril units (n = 5–8) bound by pairs of methylene groups.1 Depending on the number of glycoluril fragments, the inner
equatorial diameter of the cavitands varies from 4.4 to 8.8 Å
as the height of 9.1 Å is constant for all macrocycles (the chemical
structure is shown in Figure 1).

Figure 1 Structures of CB[n] and styryl dyes.

This increase of research activity can be attributed,
to a certain
extent, to the ability of cucurbiturils, whose both portals carry
a considerable negative charge, to form stable host–guest complexes
with cations of appropriate size (for a recent review, see ref (2)). What matters is that
the production of complexes commonly results in a significant change
in the physicochemical features of a guest molecule. In particular,
the ability of the cucurbituril inclusion complexes of organic dyes
to increase the fluorescence quantum yield of the guest molecule is
of great significance for possible practical application in various
fields of applied and fundamental science.

This can be best
illustrated by a specific example: Li and co-workers3 have observed that the fluorescence of aqueous
solution of a styryl dye, trans-4-[4-(dimethylamino)styryl]-1-methylpyridinium
iodide (1) (the chemical structure of 1 is
shown in Figure 1)
increases 270 times upon addition of CB[6]. The binding constant of
1:1 complexes obtained by fluorescence titration was found to be 1
× 105 M–1. Quantum–chemical
calculations, which are confirmed by NMR measurements, have shown
that in the case of the ground state of the host–guest complex,
the positively charged pyridinium group of the dye is inserted in
the cavity as its larger styryl moiety is placed outside the cavitand.
Also, it turns out that such a structure of complexes is common at
least for complexes with styryl dyes. The same structure of inclusion
complexes with CB[7], whose binding constant is about 106 M–1, was found for a close analogue of 1, 4-[(E)-2-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)ethenyl]-1-ethylpyridinium
perchlorate (2).4 In this
case, a 5-fold increase in the quantum yield of fluorescence was observed.

On the other hand, Glasbeek and co-workers have experimentally
found that the mechanism of radiationless relaxation of excited styryl
dyes is determined by rotations around single C–C bonds and
only restrictions, imposed simultaneously on all rotations, result
in a considerable increase of fluorescence.5 Therefore, the typical structure of the host–guest complexes
in the ground state obviously has no effect on fluorescence, which
contradicts the experimental results.

This contradiction can
be removed if we assume that upon photoexcitation,
there is a pronounced shift of the electronically excited styryl dye
into the depth of the cavity (see Figure 2).

Figure 2 Energy-minimized structures of the inclusion
complex between 2 and CB[7] in the ground (left) and
excited (right) states.

It may be implied that such supramolecular systems have an
interesting
relaxation mechanism of electronically excited states on picoseconds
time scale. However, ultrafast dynamics of photocontrolled CB complexes
is still largely unexplored. Trying to fill this knowledge gap, we
present here our experimental results obtained over recent years on
the ultrafast relaxation dynamics of excited host–guest complexes
between cucurbiturils and styryl dyes as a representative fluorophore
family. In addition, we outline a simple model that allows the estimation
of the characteristic time of the restructuring of inclusion complexes
upon photoexcitation.

Results and Discussion
Photophysical Properties
of Styryl Dyes
These are heterocyclic
organic species that have been extensively studied owing to their
applications in high-tech fields, e.g., fluorescent labeling, applications
based on nonlinear optical properties, chemosensors, organic light
emitting diodes, photochemical applications, laser dyes, etc. (for
review, see ref (6)). In particular, styryl dye 2-(4-(dimethylamino)styryl)-1-methylpyridinium
iodide (close analogue of 1) selectively stains the mitochondria
in living cells so that the membrane potential of the mitochondria
can be measured by its fluorescence.7

The well-characterized styryl dye cations, whose chemical structure
is shown in Figure 1, are able to produce a stable 1:1 inclusion complex with cucurbiturils
of appropriate size.

Figure 3 shows typical
steady-state absorption and fluorescence spectra of 1, as a representative example, in the presence of one equivalent
of CB[6] and without it.8 The addition
of CB[6] decreases the amplitude of the absorption peak at 450 nm,
as its position and half-width are not varied. On doing so, the peak
of fluorescence shifts to a blue spectral region by approximately
25 nm and its half-width insignificantly decreases; the peak of fluorescence
increases 270 times, which clearly points to the production of the
inclusion complexes. Upon the formation of 1:1 host–guest complexes,
the fluorescence of 2 increases by 12.6 times in the
case of CB[6] and 1.3 times in complexes with CB[8]. The binding constant
of 2 with CB[6] has been determined to be 1.1 ×
105 M–1. The addition of CB[5] does not
lead to any change in the photophysical properties of a solution of 2, indicating the absence of complexes between CB[5] and 2.9

The electronically excited state
of styryl dyes in water is strongly
quenched. The fluorescence quantum yield of the aqueous solution of 2 is 2.6%,4 while that of 2-4-(diphenylamino)phenyl-ethenyl-1-methylpyridinium
iodide (close analogue of 1) is about 0.03–0.05
%.10,11

A peculiar property of styryl cations
is that they are dipolar
A+–π–D systems, where the pyridinium
unit A+, electron acceptor, and dimethylaminophenyl D,
electron donor, are linked by a π-electron conjugated bridge.12 It is well known that the positive charge, which
is mainly localized on the acceptor pyridinium group in the ground
state, moves toward the dimethylanilino donor group upon excitation.13 In the case of 1, it is shown by
semiempirical calculations that in the ground state, the positive
charge of +0.968e is concentrated mostly on methyl
pyridinium moiety, while the N,N-dimethyl aniline moiety has got a positive charge of +0.192e. Upon excitation, it is shown that the positive charge
decreases on methyl pyridinium moiety from +0.968e to +0.631e, whereas it increased on N,N-dimethyl aniline moiety from +0.192e to +0.686e. Recently, Chernikova and co-workers14 have calculated that the value of the charge
transferred from benzene to pyridinium group is 0.33e for the azacrown-containing styryl dye, which is a close analogue
of 1.

Photoinduced charge transfer can provide
the possibility for the
styryl dye cation to move inside the cucurbituril cavity, complicating
the fast dynamics of electronically excited inclusion complexes. Thus,
let us consider a simple physically clear model of this interesting
feature.

Simple Theoretical Model
We will consider a common
structure of the ground state of host–guest complexes in which
the charged pyridinium moiety is located inside the cavity as another
part of dye is outside of it.3,4 Upon photoexcitation
of guest dyes, intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) occurs and guests
can be embedded deeper in the cavity.

To model the displacement
of guest species inside the cavity, let us consider an immobile negatively
charged circle, which is placed at the origin of the coordinate on
the z–y-plane, and a point
positive charge that can move along x-axis (see Figure 4). This system simulates
the interaction of negatively charged portal of CB with the positive
charge of styryl dye. In equilibrium, the point charge of the pyridinium
group is placed at the origin of the coordinates. Upon photoexcitation,
a rapid redistribution of electron density occurs and the positive
charge passes to the toluene group; in other words, at x0 point out of the z–y-plane. This leads to a significant increase in the potential energy
of the system. In the course of relaxation that follows photoexcitaiton,
the positive charge, rigidly connected with the molecular frame of
the dye, returns to the zero position.

Figure 4 Electrostatic interaction
between a circle of radius a with charge q and a point charge e (see the explanation
in the text).

The potential energy
of the circle with a negative charge of q and a mobile positive charge e as a function
of the distance from the center of the circle
along the x-axis is 1  here, ε
is the dielectric constant of
the media and a is the radius of the circle.

Hence, the total energy of the system 2  where m is the mass of the
point charge that is equal to the mass of the dye particle.

From eqs 1 and 2, it follows 3  Assuming
that x/a < 1 and expending eq 3 in series in terms of
this small parameter, we obtain 4  From eq 4, it follows 5  and the time take by the positive charge to
reach the origin of the coordinate from point x0 is expressed by the formula 6  Taking into account that  is a known integral,15 we finally obtain 7  Taking
physically reasonable values of a ≈ 2 Å,
ε ≈ 10,2m = 200 a.e., and q is
of order of e, which is equal to the charge of electron,
we have obtained T ≈ 500 fs. Viscosity, which
has not been taken into account, obviously increases the value of T so that it is a lower bound for the time taken for deeper
embedding into the cavity. In other words, the processes associated
with the structural changes of inclusion complexes between cucurbiturils
and styryl dyes are on the picosecond time scale. To study the relaxation
of the electronically excited states on the picosecond time scale,
it is common to use a time-resolved fluorescence up-conversion technique;16 in our case, the experimental setup was based
on a Cr: Forsterite laser that generates pulses of 90 fs with a repetition
rate of 96 MHz (pulse energy of 7 nJ) at a fundamental wavelength
of about 1250 nm.17

Ultrafast Kinetics of Electronically
Excited Host–Guest
Complexes between Cucurbiturils and Styryl Dyes
The time-resolved
relaxation of the electronically excited states of styryl dyes has
been studied in detail (see refs (5, 18−20) and the references herein) and is usually considered
in terms of the model depicted in Figure 5. The Frank–Condon state (FC) of the
first excited state S1 is created when the trans-form of
the ground state S0 of styryl dyes is excited by light.
The subsequent relaxation can be considered as a downhill motion of
the representative point along a one-dimensional profile of the potential
energy of the system. The initial stage, which is associated with
vibrational cooling and intramolecular charge transfer (ICT), occurs
within a few hundreds of femtoseconds. It is accompanied by a considerable
change in the dipole moment of the dye molecule. This change leads
to the reorganization of the solvation shell on a picosecond time
scale, as well as to the significant diminution of the potential energy
of the system. Having an approximately planar structure at this phase
of relaxation,18 the dye fluoresces at
wavelengths that become longer, while the potential energy of the
S1 state diminishes and that of the S0 state
grows simultaneously.

Figure 5 Schematic plot of the potential energies of styryl dyes
versus
the reaction coordinate (see discussion in the text).

Intramolecular rotary motions of styryl dye determine
a slower
relaxation stage. They include isomerization around a double bond
and rotation around either single bonds in the C–C=C–C
fragment. The single-bond rotation results in the so-called twisted
intramolecular charge transfer (TICT) state that corresponds to the
minimum energy S1. It also plays the role of a nonradiative
“sink” region, the conical intersection (CI). A characteristic
time of internal conversion via CI is about 100 fs.21 The CI region can be reached from the fluorescent ICT state
over a low-energy barrier that strongly quenches the fluorescence.
Thus, there are three characteristic decay times: the first is of
the order of hundred femtoseconds, the second of about 1 ps, and the
third of tens ps. One may expect that this scheme is also applicable
to describing the photophysics of the host–guest complexes
of styryl dyes with cucurbiturils that is confirmed by the experiment.22−24

The production of inclusion complexes with CB[n] (n = 6, 7) changes the longest decay time τ3 from ca. 50 ps for free 2 to 100–200
ps for bound 2 in agreement with the observed enhancement
of the steady-state fluorescence. As mentioned above, to increase
the fluorescence of guest species, the cavity should significantly
slow down all intramolecular rotations of the dye in the excited state
that cannot be provided by the complex structure in the ground state.
This means that after photoexcitation, styryl dye penetrates deeper
into the cavity of cucurbiturils, increasing the potential barrier
between the ICT and TICT states. The movement inside the cavity is
caused by a Coulombic interaction of the negatively charged portals
of cavitands with the positively charged dye. The characteristic time
of such a shift has been estimated to be about 1 ps (see issue 3).
Such a structural reorganization of the inclusion complexes with CB[6]
is in agreement with the NMR data obtained by Li and co-workers.3 They showed that the protonation of the ground
state of 1, when the amino group becomes positively charged,
which to some extent plays a role similar to the photoinduced charge
transfer, the aniline ring shifts to the CB[6] cavity.

It is
worth noting that the inclusion complex of 1 with CB[6]
acts by definition25 as a
molecular machine (switch); that is, it is a supramolecular system
with a mechanical motion of considerable amplitude that can be caused
by various stimuli (for example, light). The same conclusion was reached
by Chernikova and co-workers when they studied the inclusion complexes
between CB[7] and styryl (pyridinium) dyes that are close analogue
of 1.14

Components with
a short decay time τ1 of 100–200
fs, which is associated with vibrational cooling, disappear in the
blue region of the fluorescence band of both nonbound and bound 1. In the red region of the fluorescence band, the components
arise with approximately the same time constants that are clearly
seen in Figures 6 and 7.

The characteristic time of hydration
is about 2 ps, which is determined
by the rotary motion of the water molecules in the dye hydration shell,26 which should be modified by the production of
inclusion complexes between CB[n] and styryl dye.
According to the above estimation made in issue 3, to get a structural
equilibrium, the excited complex needs the time τ2, whose value may overlap with other characteristic times of the
system. To understand the mechanism of such a supramolecular solvation
in a more quantitative sense, we have studied the time-dependent fluorescence
Stokes shift on a picosecond time scale.8

Time-resolved emission spectra were derived from a set of
emission
decays (see Figures 6 and 7) taken at selected wavelengths according
to a procedure that was first described by Maroncelly and Fleming.27,28

Figures 8 and 9 depict the representative spectral reconstructions
for instantaneous spectra of aqueous solution of 1 and
its complexes with CB[6] as two-dimensional (2D) fluorescence function
in the range of 5 ps. The dependence of the wave numbers, which are
related to the fluorescence maxima, on time is indicated by black
circles. The temporal transformation of the dye hydration shell demonstrates
itself in the continuous red shift of the fluorescence spectrum that
is clearly seen in Figures 8 and 9. The solvation involves primarily
a libration motion of water molecules and displacement of CB[6], if
it is present in solution. The time dependence of the Stokes shift
is commonly described by the solvation time correlation function 8  here, ν(0), ν(∞), and ν(t) are the wave numbers of the maxima of the emission spectra
at t = 0, t →∞ when
the system is in equilibrium, and at an intermediate time t. Since the aim of this work is to elucidate the kinetics
of excited inclusion complexes, ultrafast components that correspond
to an inertial response of solvent are not necessary to resolve. This
simplifies the task because a poorly determined value of ν(0)
is not required.

decay of aqueous solution of 1. The temporal evolution

The evolution of the maxima of the fluorescence spectra,
which
are shown as black circles in Figures 8 and 9, fits to eq 9, which is obtained from eq 8 9  In Table 1, there are results of this fitting. It is worth noting
that the values ν(∞) are in good agreement with the maxima
wavelengths of the steady-state fluorescence spectra. Shorter solvation
times can be attributed to vibrational cooling, while longer ones
can be attributed to the rotation of water molecules in the first
hydration shell of 1. The addition of CB[6] results in
change of τ2 from 0.81 ps for nonbound 1 to 1.15 ps for the bound dye that is associated with the rotary
motion of water molecules in the solvation shell. The value of τ1, which can be attributed to the vibrational cooling, changed
from 118 to 224 fs when CB[6] is added in the aqueous solution of 1.

It can be rationalized as follows. The rigid hydrophobic cavity
of cucurbiturils has low polarizability,2 so it cannot considerably change the dye solvation energy as compared
to the influence of polar water molecules in the first hydration shell.
The cucurbituril cavity seems to play the role of the second hydrophobic
solvation shell that affects the first hydrophilic one. Inside the
CB[6] cavity, rigorous restrictions are imposed on the intramolecular
rotations of styryl dye24 and on the libration
of polar water molecules in the first hydration shell. In addition,
CB[6] can disturb the hydrogen-bond network around the dye. An observed
increase in a shorter solvation time may be related to the well-known
fact that a dense network of hydrogen bonds accelerates vibrational
cooling.30 It is worth noting that a value
of a hypsochromic shift of the steady-state fluorescence, caused by
complexation, is about 2.3 kcal/mol, which is in good agreement with
the free energy of the H-bond dissociation.29 Therefore, CB[6] destroys the H-bond net, increasing the energy
of the system.

Having replaced water by heavy water, we found31 that the 580 nm maximum of the steady-state
fluorescence
spectra of 1 in the complex is independent of the solvent,
whereas the maximum of free 1 at 603 nm in H2O shifts to 610 nm in D2O. The fluorescence quantum yield
increases insignificantly, by 6% for the free dye and 15% for its
complex with cucurbituril; i.e., a weak normal isotope effect according
to the accessed terminology32 was observed.
This indicates that the rate of nonradiative processes competing with
fluorescence is almost independent of the solvent type. Within the
framework of the simple model mentioned above, τ1 in the order of magnitude of 100 fs can be assigned to the vibrational
cooling of the electronically excited dye. It is known that the vibrational
cooling in heavy water is slower than that in conventional water,33 a distinction that explains an increase in the
characteristic time τ1 in heavy water for the free
dye. In host–guest complexes with cucurbituril, the molecular
structure of water is substantially distorted. It may be expected
that the cavitand hydrophobic cavity hinders the formation of the
normal network of H-bonds in water and the same in heavy water. It
is likely for this reason that the addition of CB[6] to the system
causes an insignificant increase in τ1 regardless
of the solvent.

The longer characteristic time τ2, which is associated
with the rotational diffusion of the solvent molecular dipoles, is
also determined by the time of the translational displacement of styryl
dye relative to the cavitand in the presence of cucurbiturils. The
increase in τ2 from 799 to 1149 fs by replacing H2O with D2O can be attributed to a higher degree
of structuring and viscosity of D2O than those of H2O.8 The presence of CB[6] in the
solution substantially increases τ2 in comparison
with pure solvent (Table 1). This increase can be accounted for by the fact that the
formation of the metastable fluorescence state involves the translational
movement of the dye solvate in the cavity, where the local viscosity
seems to be substantially higher than the viscosity in the free solvent.
In addition, the transferred solvate mass is evidently higher for
D2O, thereby leading to an increase in τ2 in comparison with H2O.

It is should be noted that
within the molecular machine concept,
this time can be considered as a molecular switch actuation time.
In other words, the time required for the electronically excited styryl
dye 1 to move inside the CB6 cavitand is approximately
1.1 ps in water and 1.6 ps in heavy water.

Fluorescence Anisotropy
of Inclusion Complexes
To shed
light on the photoinduced movement of dye molecules in cucurbiturils,
we have measured the temporal fluorescence anisotropy of such supramolecular
systems.34

By definition, the fluorescence
anisotropy is as follows 10  here, I∥ and I⊥ are
the fluorescence intensities
measured in parallel and crossed directions of the analyzer relative
to the linear polarized exciting pulse, respectively. For species
having the form close to that of an elongated ellipsoid, which corresponds
to 1, the kinetics of the fluorescence anisotropy decay,
caused by rotational diffusion, is described by a single time constant
and depends on the solvent viscosity η and the volume of the
fluorophore complex with its close environment V(35) 11  where  is the rotational correlation time of the
fluorophore, which is determined by the rotational diffusion of the
fluorescing complex (solvate). Here, k is the Boltzmann
constant and T is the absolute solution temperature.
From the relation r = r(t) according to eq 11, a characteristic lifetime of φ ≈ 207 ps was
found for host–guest complexes and that of φ ≈
84 ps for the free dye.34 These results
agree satisfactorily with the data obtained under the steady-state
conditions.4

The value of r0 is determined by faster
structural changes in the solvate 12  here, β is the angle between the absorbing
and emitting solvate oscillators. From eq 12, it follows that the highest value of anisotropy
is 0.4 if the absorbing and emitting oscillators are parallel, with
an average value of 0.39–0.37.7 Note
that the anisotropy becomes 0.38 when this angle is about 11°.
On the subpicosecond time scale, the rotation of the molecules relative
to the laboratory coordinate system can be neglected, and the anisotropy
measurements may give insight into the intramolecular processes or
the relaxation processes associated with the close solvation environment.

Figure 10 shows
the anisotropy dependence curves r = r(t) for 1 in water, ethylene glycol,
and complexes with CB[6] on the time scale of up to 2.5 ps. Time dependence
curves for the total fluorescence intensity I = I∥ + 2I⊥ are also shown in the figure. The anisotropy r = r(t) reaches an almost limiting value of r ≈ 0.38 after no more than 500 fs of fluorescence
excitation and remains constant for the dye in ethylene glycol or
in complex with CB[6] and slightly decreases in the aqueous solution.
For times shorter than 500 fs, almost the same behavior of fluorescence
anisotropy was observed for all the samples. The accuracy of the measurements
on this time scale does not allow obtaining more detailed information
on the dynamics of anisotropy.

Figure 10 Fluorescence anisotropy and total intensity
at 650 nm as a function
of time: (a) host–guest complex of 1 with CB[6],
(b) solution of 1 in ethylene glycol, and (c) aqueous
solution of 1 (fluorescence excitation at 420 nm). (Reprinted

In view of these findings,
it can be argued that the dye environment
in the aqueous solution in the presence of CB[6] is more alike to
the viscous solvation shell in ethylene glycol rather than the hydration
shell in water. This conclusion confirms the assumption that in the
host–guest complex, there is a fast translational displacement
of the dye cation into the cavity after excitation by laser pulse.

Conclusions
In this report, we review recent results on
the ultrafast relaxation
dynamics of electronically excited host–guest complexes of
cucurbiturils with pyridinium styryl dyes. Ultrafast fluorescence
decays of free dyes and that bound by CB are fitted satisfactorily
by the sum of three exponentials. The addition of CB to aqueous solutions
of dyes increases the longest relaxation times from about 50 ps for
the free dyes to 100–150 ps for the bound ones. This is related
to the slowing down of the intramolecular rotations around the single
bonds of the styryl moiety that is caused by guest’s displacement
inside the cavity. The ultrafast fluorescence depolarization of a
styryl dye shows that the displacement is a translational motion along
the CB axis. Such movements are caused by electrostatic interaction
of a negatively charged CB portal with the guest positive charge that
undergoes photoinduced transfer. In fact, such complexes are a molecular
machine, the molecular switch.

The fluorescence decays also
include components with time constants
of about 100 and 1 ps, which are almost independent of complexation.
They are associated with vibrational relaxation and supramolecular
solvation of the excited sate of styryl dyes, respectively. In other
words, a longer time is a response time of the photocontrolled molecular
machine. It is worth noting that ultrafast dynamics of such type of
machines is still largely unexplored and authors hope that this perspective
prompts further studies in this field of supramolecular chemistry.
