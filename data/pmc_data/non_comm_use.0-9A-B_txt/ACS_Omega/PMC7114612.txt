Effects of preparation parameters
of NiAl oxide-supported Au nanocatalysts
on their performance in the chemoselective hydrogenation of nitro
compounds were investigated. The deposition–precipitation method,
low Au loading, and low Ni/Al molar ratio of the support contributed
to the generation of small-sized Au nanoparticles. High catalytic
properties were related to the small sizes of Au particles and appropriate
basicity of supports. Accordingly, the 0.43% Au/NiAlO-2-500 (the Ni/Al
molar ratio of the support = 2) showed high activity and excellent
selectivity for nitro hydrogenation. It also showed good versatility
for other nitro compounds and good recyclability. Interestingly, for
the first time, this Au catalyst switched its selectivity to vinyl
hydrogenation by mere regulation of the composition of the support
(the Ni/Al molar ratio of the support = 4). The observed shift in
selectivity was ascribed to the different adsorption behaviors of
the nitro and vinyl group on Au nanocatalysts. It provides a novel
and facile strategy to construct Au nanocatalysts with high activity
and switchable selectivity for hydrogenation of nitro compounds by
the fine tuning of preparation parameters.

1 Introduction
The chemoselective hydrogenation
of nitro compounds to the corresponding
aromatic amines is one of the most important reactions in both academia
and industry, as the resulting compounds serve as the important intermediates
for pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, fine chemicals, dyes, and polymers.1−4 This kind of reaction has been successfully reduced by stoichiometric
reducing agents such as sodium hydrosulfite, iron, and zinc, generating
a large number of byproducts which are very harmful to our environment.2,5 From the viewpoints of green chemistry and sustainable development,
it is our objective that the reaction mentioned above is carried out
over heterogeneous catalysts with H2 as the reductant under
mild conditions.

As one of the most used heterogeneous hydrogenation
catalysts,
the platinum-group metal catalysts such as platinum and palladium
are usually employed for this kind of reaction, but they suffer from
low selectivity, especially when the nitro group and other reductive
functional groups co-exist on the same substrate because of the simultaneous
hydrogenation of these reductive groups.6,7 The preferential
activation and hydrogenation of the nitro group could be achieved
by tuning Pt absorption characteristic with phosphorous additives.8 The Pt single-atom and pseudo single-atom on
FeOx displayed outstanding activity and
high selectivity for hydrogenation of the nitro group.9 Recently, atomically dispersed Pt over α-MoC was
reported to be a highly CO-resistant and selective catalyst for hydrogenation
of nitrobenzene derivatives.10 Although
these catalytic processes are effective, the addition of phosphorous
additives are detrimental to our environment, especially, the preparation
of Pt single-atom catalysts remains critical and usually must be controlled
precisely. It is still highly desirable to develop the kind of heterogeneous
catalysts with high performance for chemoselective hydrogenation of
nitro compounds.

Because Haruta et al. discovered the unprecedented
catalytic activity
of supported Au nanoparticles for low temperature CO oxidation, gold
nanocatalysts have gained increasingly much attention and are widely
used in a variety of important reactions, especially in selective
hydrogenations.4,11−17 Corma and Serna2 first reported that
Au/TiO2 afforded >95% selectivity toward 3-aminostyrene
at high conversion in the chemoselective hydrogenation of 3-nitrostyrene,
which was far more selective than Pd/C and Pt/C. Recently, using the
colloidal deposition methods, gold nanoparticles positioned on the
edge/corner sites of TiO2 showed the 99% conversion and
99% selectivity in the selective hydrogenation of 3-nitrobenzene.18 Gold catalysts with the well-controlled size
(2.0 nm) were also obtained through the calcination of cysteine-capped
Au25 nanoclusters on ZnAl-hydrotalcite, giving >98%
selectivity
to 3-vinylaniline at complete conversion.19 The modification of the support with a single-site Sn promoter,
or the change in the types of divalent metal ions of the hydrotalcite
support also affected catalytic performances and even hydrogenation
reaction pathways.20,21 Therefore, it is a general and
facile approach to construct gold nanocatalysts with high property
by the fine control of preparation parameters.

Following the
aforementioned rule, gold nanocatalysts were obtained
with the use of the deposition–precipitation method and NiAl-hydrotalcite
as a precursor of the support. The as-prepared Au nanocatalysts exhibited
high activity, excellent selectivity to nitro hydrogenation for chemoselective
hydrogenation of 4-nitrostyrene. It also showed good performance for
the selective reduction of other substrates containing nitro groups.
Moreover, the selectivity toward nitro hydrogenation could be drastically
switched to vinyl hydrogenation by changing the composition of the
support. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first report to shift
the selectivity from hydrogenation of the nitro group to the vinyl
group via the modification of the composition of the support. The
observed properties probably resulted from the small sizes of gold
nanoparticles and nature of NiAl oxides.

2 Results
& Discussion
The NiAl-layered double hydroxide (LDH)
materials and the corresponding
Au catalysts were prepared using the co-precipitation method22,23 and deposition–precipitation method,23 respectively (see the Experimental Section for details). A series of characterizations, including X-ray diffraction
(XRD), inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry (ICP–AES),
transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS), and CO2-temperature-programmed desorption (TPD),
were conducted to obtain the structure and nature of supports and
gold catalysts. The narrow, symmetric, and strong peaks of the support
at 2θ angles (i.e., <25°) were observed, confirming
its well-defined layered structure characteristics (Figure 1a). After calcination, the
patterns of the mixed oxide reflected those of NiO because of the
minor content of aluminum.23 No diffraction
peaks belonging to Au were found for as-prepared gold nanocatalysts.
It is related to the low loading or high dispersion of gold nanoparticles
on the surface of NiAlO-2. The low content of as-prepared gold catalysts
was also confirmed by ICP–AES (Table 1).

500 rpm; and reaction time 4 h.

b The molar ratio of Ni to Al and
the Au actual loading were determined by ICP–AES.

c The conversion of 4-nitrostyrene
and selectivity toward the products were determined by gas chromatography
(GC) and GC–mass spectrometry (MS). No other byproducts were
observed, and the carbon mass balance of about 96% was obtained by
using o-xylene as an internal standard.

To obtain the size distributions
of gold nanoparticles, high-angle
annular dark-field imaging scanning TEM (HAADF-STEM) characterizations
were conducted. As shown in Figure 2a, no gold nanoparticles were observed for 0.15% Au/NiAlO-2-500,
but the elemental mappings showed Au, Ni, and Al (Figure 2b, O omitted). It indicated
that this catalyst might had the very small size because of the low
loading of gold (i.e., ultrasmall clusters and even single atoms).
The average particle sizes of 0.43% Au/NiAlO-2-500 and 0.68% Au/NiAlO-2-500
catalysts were 3.5 and 4.8 nm, respectively, while the 0.38% Au/NiAlO-2-500-SD
catalyst prepared using the sol deposition method possessed the larger
average diameter of 6.1 nm along with the broader size distribution
(Figure 2c–e).
The HRTEM image of Au nanoparticles showed the obvious crystal lattices
subjected to Au, with a crystal lattice spacing of 0.204 nm (inset
of HAADF-STEM image of 0.43% Au/NiAlO-2-500), which is in accordance
with the (200) planes of Au nanoparticles.23 It showed that the gold species on the support existed in the state
of metal particles. The average particle sizes of 0.38% Au/NiAlO-3-500
and 0.44% Au/NiAlO-4-500 were 8.6 and 7.7 nm (Figure 2f–g), respectively. Although using
the same preparation procedure and similar Au loadings, the mean size
and size distributions of gold nanoparticles on supports with different
compositions were different, indicating the different capabilities
of supports to anchor gold nanoparticles.

the crystal lattice and the size distributions of gold nanoparticles.

XPS were carried out to clarify the chemical states
of gold nanocatalysts
(Figure 3). Of note,
the 0.15% Au/NiAl-2-500 only gave noisy spectra because of the low
loading of gold (not shown). For 0.43% Au/NiAl-2-500 and 0.68% Au/NiAl-2-500,
the binding energies of Au 4f7/2 were 83.9 eV, which are
characteristic of 4f7/2 of the Au metallic (84.0 eV),24 which is in in accordance with the HRTEM results.
CO2-TPD was conducted to measure the basicity of supports
and the corresponding Au catalysts. As shown in Figure 3 (right), the desorption temperatures of
CO2 (200–550 °C) and amounts of basic sites
of NiAl oxides and the corresponding Au catalysts gradually increased
with the increase in the molar ratio of Ni to Al. Among the observed
samples, the NiAl-4-500 support and the 0.44% Au/NiAl-4-500 catalyst
gave the strongest basicity, respectively.

Chemoselective hydrogenation
of 4-nitrostyrene was employed as
a model reaction to evaluate catalytic properties of the as-prepared
Au nanocatalysts, and the results are listed in Table 1. The plain NiAlO-2-500 support offered a
negligible activity, while gold nanoparticles loaded on NiAlO-x-500 exhibited good catalytic properties, indicating that
gold nanoparticles were catalytic active sites. It was previously
reported that gold atoms active for H2 dissociation were
neutral or had a net charge close to zero.25 According to our characterization results, the as-prepared Au nanoparticles
existed at zero valence, confirming that they were indeed active sites.
Furthermore, 0.43% Au/NiAlO-2-500 prepared by using the deposition–precipitation
method showed higher catalytic performance than 0.38% Au/NiAlO-2-500-SD
prepared by using the colloidal deposition method (entries 2 and 3).
The former afforded the 98.4% conversion of 4-nitrostyrene and 98.1%
selectivity to 4-aminostyrene, while the latter only afforded the
29.4% conversion and 95.0% selectivity. Therefore, the deposition–precipitation
method was hereafter chosen and used to obtain Au nanocatalysts.

Next, the effects of preparation parameters such as Au loading
amounts and calcination temperature were examined. When the Au actual
loading was 0.43% and the calcination temperature was 500 °C,
the corresponding 0.43% Au/NiAlO-2-500 catalysts showed the highest
catalytic properties among the catalysts examined (entries 2–5).
In gold-catalyzed hydrogenation reactions, the activation and dissociation
of H2 is often the rate-limiting step. Small-sized gold
nanocatalysts such as 0.43% Au/NiAlO-2-500 have more low-coordinated
edge and corner atoms, being usually considered to be catalytic active
sites for H2 dissociation, and then exhibit higher catalytic
performance.19,25 It was reported that Au single
atoms were not effective for hydrogenation reactions of the aldehydes
and the nitro compounds because of the low activation capability of
H2.26,27 Instead, Au nanoclusters with
a large diameter showed high catalytic activity for hydrogenation
of the nitro compounds.27 The poor activity
of 0.15% Au/NiAlO-2-500 catalysts was supposed to be related to the
ultrasmall size of gold species.

When the molar ratio of Ni
to Al of the support changed from 2
to 4, the as-prepared Au catalysts exhibited the 74.8% conversion
of 4-nitrostyrene and 94.5% selectivity toward 4-nitroethylbenzene
under identical reaction conditions. The sizes of Au nanoparticles
in 0.44% Au/NiAlO-4-500 are larger than those of 0.43% Au/NiAlO-2-500,
thereby exhibiting the lower activity. The basicity of the catalysts
was also reported to affect the reactivity for the hydrogenation of
nitroaromatics.28,29 Tan et al.19 also found that the support with strong basicity (i.e.,
MgAl-hydrotalcite) afforded the low activity of the resultant Au nanocatalyst
for chemoselective hydrogenation of 3-nitrostyrene. As shown in the
CO2-TPD, NiAlO-4-500 as the support showed stronger basicity
than NiAlO-2-500 and partially accounted for the low activity of the
0.44% Au/NiAlO-4-500 catalyst.

To clarify the different selectivity
(hydrogenation of the nitro
group vs the vinyl group) over Au nanoparticles loaded on supports
with different compositions, control experiments were carried out
using the styrene and the mixture of styrene and nitrobenzene as substrates
under the same reaction conditions (Table 2). It showed that the styrene could be hardly
consumed on the 0.43% Au/NiAlO-2-500 catalyst no matter if there was
nitrobenzene in the substrate or not. Interestingly, the hydrogenation
of the vinyl group was preferred over that of the nitro group using
the 0.44% Au/NiAlO-4-500 catalyst. The evidence for different selectivity
over aforementioned Au catalysts was provided by attenuated total
reflection infrared (ATR-IR) spectroscopy (Figure 4). For the 0.43% Au/NiAlO-2-500 catalyst,
the IR bands, assigned to the νas(NO2)
and νs(NO2), were found at 1524 and 1347
cm–1, respectively, when 4-nitrostyrene or nitrobenzene
was used as the probe molecule, but no ν(C=C) at 1631
cm–1 and δ(=C–H) at 1419 cm–1 were observed if styrene was applied instead. For
the 0.44% Au/NiAlO-4-500 catalyst, nitrobenzene adsorption experiments
showed that the νas(NO2) and νs(NO2) were absent, and the IR bands belonging to
ν(C=C) and δ(=C–H) were observed
in the styrene or 4-nitrostyrene adsorption experiments. It showed
that the nitro group could selectively adsorb on the surface of the
0.43% Au/NiAlO-2-500 catalyst, while the vinyl group preferred to
adsorb on the surface of the 0.44% Au/NiAlO-4-500 catalyst. For chemoselective
hydrogenation of 4-nitrostyrene, 4-nitrostyrene was adsorbed on the
surface of NiAl oxides, and the adsorption configuration of the nitro
group or the vinyl group appeared over the 0.43% Au/NiAlO-2-500 or
0.44% Au/NiAlO-4-500 catalysts, respectively. Then, molecular hydrogen
was first adsorbed on the surface of Au nanoparticles, and the resulting
hydrogen atoms diffused to the surface of NiAl oxides around Au nanoparticles,
followed by the interaction with the adsorbed 4-nitrostyrene and the
generation of 4-aminostyrene or 4-nitroethylbenzene accordingly. Therefore,
the different adsorption models of the nitro group and the vinyl group
of 4-nitrostyrene over the 0.43% Au/NiAlO-2-500 and 0.44% Au/NiAlO-4-500
catalysts led to their distinct selectivity.

Considering that the nitro group is one of the most
easily reducible
groups in transition metal-catalyzed reactions, the selective hydrogenation
of the C=C double bond in the presence of the nitro group is
also a great challenge.30,31 The controllable chemoselectivity
toward the nitro and vinyl group of 3-nitrostyrene was obtained over
heterogeneous Pt and Rh catalysts by changing the source of hydrogen,
adding acid or basic organics into the reaction medium, and also using
the carbon support with surface oxygen-containing groups and hetero
P species.32−34 Recently, we reported that the switchable selectivity
for the hydrogenation of the aldehyde and the nitro group of 4-nitrobenzaldehyde
was also achieved by the use of ligand-on or ligand-off Au nanocluster
catalysts.35 Even so, to our knowledge,
our research is the first example to efficiently change the selectivity
by tuning the composition of the support. It provides a novel and
facile approach to design Au catalysts with high activity and tunable
selectivity toward the hydrogenation of nitro compounds by modifying
the composition of the support and adsorption behavior of different
reducing groups on Au catalysts.

The distribution of the products
with reaction time over the 0.43%
Au/NiAlO-2-500 catalyst for the chemoselective hydrogenation of 4-nitrostyrene
is monitored and shown in Figure 5. The yield of 4-aminostyrene increased with the increasing
reaction time. After 180 min, the yield of 4-aminostyrene reached
96.5% and then remained almost unchanged. It showed that the 0.43%
Au/NiAlO-2-500 catalyst was highly active and selective for chemoselective
hydrogenation of 4-nitrostyrene.

500 rpm; and reaction time 4 h.

The general applicability of the 0.43% Au/NiAlO-2.0-500 catalyst
for chemoselective hydrogenation of a series of nitro compounds has
been further investigated by extending the substrate scope, and the
results are listed in Table 3. As seen in Table 3, good to excellent conversions (78.6–100.0%) and excellent
selectivities (86.3–100.0%) were obtained in the hydrogenation
of substrates except for 3,5-dimethylnitrobenzene. It showed that
0.43% Au/NiAlO-2.0-500 was a highly efficient catalyst for hydrogenation
reactions of nitro compounds.

c Reaction time 165 min.

d Others include aniline.

Finally, the reusability of the
0.43% Au/NiAlO-2.0-500 catalyst
was examined. No apparent loss of conversion and selectivity was observed
when it was consecutively recycled six times in the chemoselective
hydrogenation of 4-nitrostyrene (Figure 6). Subsequently, the used catalyst was examined
by XRD, HAADF-STEM, and ICP–AES (Figures 1 and 2). XRD results
showed no obvious changes in the used catalyst. HAADF-STEM results
confirmed that the average size and distribution of gold nanoparticles
did not change obviously, and the gold loading of the used catalyst
was almost the same as that of the fresh one, as determined by ICP–AES.
These results demonstrate that the 0.43% Au/NiAlO-2.0-500 catalyst
was a highly active and stable catalyst for the chemoselective hydrogenation
of nitro compounds.

3 Conclusions
The
preparation conditions had great influence on the sizes of
supported Au nanoparticles, nature of support and then their performance
in nitro compounds chemoselective hydrogenation. The deposition–precipitation
method instead of the colloidal deposition method, low Au loading,
and low Ni/Al molar ratio were beneficial for the formation of small-sized
Au nanoparticles. Excellent catalytic performance of the as-prepared
Au catalysts depended on the small sizes of Au nanoparticles and basicity
of supports. The 0.43% Au/NiAlO-2-500 catalyst with NiAlO-2 as the
support afforded 98.4% conversion and 98.1% selectivity toward 4-aminostyrene
for the hydrogenation of 4-nitrostyrene. It also showed good versatility
for other substrates containing nitro groups and good recyclability.
Surprisingly, using NiAlO-4-500 as the support instead, the 0.44%
Au/NiAlO-4-500 catalyst afforded 74.8% conversion and 94.5% selectivity
for 4-nitroethylbenzene. For the first time, the switchable selectivity
for hydrogenation of the nitro group and the vinyl group was achieved
over Au catalysts by changing the composition of supports. The change
in selectivity was connected with the different adsorption configuration
of the nitro and vinyl group on the surface of the support. The fine
regulation of preparation parameters such as small sizes of Au nanoparticles
and nature of support can afford the Au nanocatalysts with excellent
activity and tunable selectivity for hydrogenation of nitro compounds.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Preparation of NiAl-LDHs
The NiAl-LDH
was obtained using the co-precipitation method.22,23 An aqueous solution of NaOH and Na2CO3 and
a mixed aqueous solution containing nickel nitrate and aluminum nitrate
were separately dropped to 50 mL of deionized water at room temperature
under stirring. The pH of the solution was maintained at around 9.0
during the process. The as-prepared material was transferred to an
autoclave and heated at 180 °C for 48 h. The resultant suspension
was separated by filtration, washed with deionized water, and dried
at 80 °C for 12 h. Finally, NiAl-LDH-x in diverse
compositions (x = 2.0, 3.0, and 4.0; x refers to the molar ratio of nickel to aluminum) were prepared by
changing the molar ratio of nickel nitrate to aluminum nitrate.

4.2 Preparation of Au Nanocatalysts
The
Au/NiAlO-x catalysts were produced by a deposition–precipitation
method.23 Typically, 1.0 g of NiAl-LDH-x was added to 80 mL of deionized water, and the as-obtained
mixture was stirred for 1 h. Then, 2.0 mL of aqueous HAuCl4 (0.025 mol/L) was then added and stirred for 2 h. After 0.3 g of
urea was added, temperature of the resulting mixture was increased
to 80 °C and maintained for a period of time. The as-prepared
suspension was centrifugated, thoroughly washed with deionized water,
and dried at 60 °C for 12 h. Finally, the solid was calcined
under an Ar atmosphere at 500 °C for 2 h, denoted as Au/NiAlO-x-500.

The Au/NiAlO-2-500-SD catalysts were prepared
as follows. Typically, 0.3 mL of aqueous HAuCl4 (0.025
mol/L) and 0.4 g of polyvinyl pyrrolidone were added to 20.0 mL of
deionized water under stirring. After 5.0 mL of deionized water containing
0.004 g NaBH4 was added dropwise, the resultant mixture
was stirred for 2.0 h. Then, 0.2 g of NiAl-LDH-2.0 was added, and
the as-obtained mixture was stirred at room temperature for 2.0 h.
The suspension was centrifugated, thoroughly washed with deionized
water, and dried at 60 °C for 12 h. Finally, the solid was calcined
under atmosphere of Ar at 500 °C for 2 h, denoted as Au/NiAlO-2-500-SD.

4.3 Characterizations of Supports and Catalysts
XRD patterns were obtained on a Shimadzu XRD-6000 using Cu Kα
radiation operated at 40 kV and 30 mA. STEM images were recorded on
a JEOL JEM2100F S/TEM in a high-angle annular dark-field STEM mode
at an operating voltage of 200 kV. The gold content and molar ratio
of nickel to aluminum of catalysts were measured by ICP–AES.
XPS were performed under ultrahigh vacuum (<10–6 Pa) on a Thermo Scientific ESCALAB 250Xi spectrometer with an Al
anode (Al Kα = 1486.6 eV). All binding energies were calibrated
using contaminant carbon (C 1s = 284.6) as the reference. CO2-TPD was examined on a micromeritics chemisorb 2720 instrument with
a thermal conductivity detector. An ATR-IR spectroscope was equipped
with a DTGS detector, and the spectrum was recorded with a Nicolet
5700 spectrometer.

4.4 Evaluation of Catalytic
Properties of Au Nanocatalysts
The chemoselective hydrogenation
of 4-nitrostyrene was carried
out in a stainless steel autoclave equipped with a pressure gauge
under magnetic stirring. The 5.0 mL of toluene, 100 μL of 4-nitrostyrene,
and 0.1 g of Au catalysts were introduced into the autoclave. After
sealing, the autoclave was flushed 4 times with hydrogen and then
pressurized at 1.0 MPa. To initiate the reaction, the reactor was
heated to 100 °C and maintained at this temperature under stirring.
After reaction, the mixture was cooled to room temperature and analyzed
by GC/MS.
