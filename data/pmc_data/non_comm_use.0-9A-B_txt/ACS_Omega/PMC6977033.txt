Mg alloys have attracted
extensive attention in the biomedical
fields owing to their great biocompatibility, suitable mechanical
properties, and biodegradability, etc. However, the fast degradation
rate restricts the application of Mg alloys. Thus, the surface treatment
of Mg alloys is considered as one of the most effective ways to enhance
the corrosion resistance of Mg alloys. Nevertheless, simple processing
to improve the corrosion resistance can no longer meet the growing
biofunctional clinical requirements. Therefore, functionalized processing
has become one of the key development directions for surface treatment
in the future, such as functionalized Mg alloys with antibacterial
property and hydrophobicity. There are few papers that review the
functionalized processing of surface treatment. This review summarized
and compared the major advances of the surface treatment (anticorrosion
processing and functionalized processing) of Mg alloys. Then, some
potential research suggestions are proposed, which may provide a reference
for the development of Mg alloys.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Nowadays, Mg alloys have attracted extensive attention especially
in the biomedical fields due to their desirable biocompatibility,
mechanical properties, and biodegradability.1,2 As
a biomedical metal, Mg alloys have a density and elastic modulus similar
to natural bone, which can effectively decrease the stress shielding
effect. Moreover, secondary surgery can normally be avoided because
of the biodegradability of Mg alloys used as implants such as a bone
screw. However, Mg has active chemical properties and poor corrosion
resistance in an aqueous environment, especially with a chloride ion.
The over fast corrosion rate resulted in the serious degradation of
mechanical properties of Mg alloys, while the bone heals, which may
cause fractures again. At the same time, accumulated hydrogen which
was the byproduct of Mg degradation may form an air cavity around
implants, and this was disadvantageous for the healing of bone and
tissue. Therefore, improving the corrosion resistance of Mg alloys
is the primary goal.

Surface treatment, an effective way to
enhance anticorrosion properties
of Mg alloys, is to form a protective layer on Mg alloys, which can
hinder the direct contact between Mg alloys and the physiological
environment and thus control the over fast degradation of Mg alloys.3 Four typical methods of anticorrosion processing
in surface treatments are fluoride treatment, microarc oxidation (MAO),
dip-coating, and electrodeposition. It is a consensus that improving
the corrosion resistance of Mg alloys is the fundamental purpose for
surface treatment. However, with the application of Mg alloy in practice,
new requirements for surface treatment are consistently being put
forward, like making the surface of Mg alloys functionalized. Hydrophobization
is one of the functionalized processes in surface treatments.4 In addition, the coating with antibacterial property
is given a lot of attention, which is meaningful for the healing of
patients.5 The functionalized processing
could be one of the key development directions of surface treatment
in the future. However, there were few papers to review the functionalized
processing of surface treatment. In this paper, the latest studies
about the surface treatments (anticorrosion processing and functionalized
processing) of Mg alloys were reviewed, and the development direction
was briefly predicted.

2 Anticorrosion Processing
2.1 Fluoride Treatment
Fluoride treatment
is a type of simple and effective chemical treatment, which can form
a fluorine-containing coating on the surface of Mg alloys by reacting
Mg alloys with hydrofluoric acid solution. The fluoride content in
the coating was impacted by HF concentrations, reaction time, temperature,
etc. Fluoride treatment can improve the corrosion resistance of Mg
alloys, reduce their hemolysis rate, and improve their antiplatelet
adhesion. However, it should be noted that the Mg alloy with fluorine-containing
coating has some toxicity to the cells. The release of a high concentration
of F– in the coating was not conducive to the growth
of cells.6

Furthermore, Li et al.7 found that the Mg alloy with fluorine-containing
coating slowly degraded layer by layer. However, the result was different
from the study of Barajas et al.,8 where
SEM images of the cross-sectional of fluoride-treated AZ31after 28
days of immersion displayed that the corrosion of MgF2 coating
was not uniform, and fluoride coating peeled off. Wang et al.9 also found that the cracks and localized corrosion
were observed on the surface of Mg alloys treated with alkali-fluoride
treatment after 20 days of immersion. The difference of three studies
may be due to the presence of the second phase in Mg alloys, which
results in the defect (irregularly distributed pores) of the fluoride
coating and the local stress concentration on the surface of Mg alloys.

Besides enhancing the corrosion resistance of Mg alloys, Lin et
al.10 reported that fluoride treatment
can maintain the surface features of Mg alloy microstructure. The
Mg alloy which was processed by ultrasonic etching in advance displayed
a bowl-like nest structure, and this structure remained after fluoride
treatment. Hence, fluorine treatment is a good choice for surface
treatment of Mg alloys with special morphology, like the papillary-like
pits or bowl-like nest structure.

2.2 Microarc
Oxidation
Microarc oxidation
is ordinarily used to form bioceramic coatings such as MgO coating.
The Mg alloy matrix is oxidized under high voltage in the electrolyte,
and then a protective ceramic layer is formed in situ on the surface
of Mg alloys. The protective layer fabricated by MAO has a high bonding
strength with the substrate. Due to the complex reaction process,
the MAO coating result is affected by various factors, such as voltage,
duty cycle, MAO time, current density, and so on. MAO coating can
effectively improve the corrosion resistance of Mg alloys, but the
coating contains a large number of pores and cracks.11 The further improvement of corrosion resistance is limited
by the pores in the MAO coating. The solution penetrates into the
Mg alloy matrix through the pores of the MAO coating, which will decrease
the protective effect of the coating. Therefore, researchers generally
post-treat the as-deposited MAO coating through other methods to solve
this problem. The hydrothermal treatment6 and sol–gel method12 are the common
post-treatment methods. In addition to sealing the pores, there is
a viewpoint that the semisealing pores formed by the post-treatment
of MAO coating pores can be utilized as a medicine loader or to enhance
the bonding strength of multiple coatings.

Microarc oxidation
(MAO) treatment can enhance the corrosion resistance. However, for
biomedical application, the biocompatibility of MAO coating is far
from enough, which should be further improved. Some bioactive material
such as calcium phosphates can be introduced into the MAO coating.
The surface microstructure is also a considerable method to enhance
the bioactivity. Meanwhile, as a ceramic coating, the surface of the
MAO coating is normally magnetic and electrically insulated. Magnetic
or electric simulation is proved to be effective for the osteogenesis.13 Therefore, the electric conductor MAO coating
could be a profound field.

2.3 Dip-Coating
Dip-coating
is one of
the most frequently used sol–gel methods, which mainly includes
several procedures of dipping, extraction, cross-linking or curing,
and drying. It is simple and easy to operate, but there are many factors
for the coating, like solution concentration and withdrawal speed. Table 1 listed common parameters
in the process of dip-coating and the thickness of the coating.14−24 These factors have a significant impact on the thickness, pore size,
uniformity, and corrosion resistance of the coating.

Dip-coating is widely
use to prepare organic coating, which is
considered to have superior biological properties.19 To date, the most commonly prepared organic coatings are
PCL, PLGA, PLA, and chitosan, etc. Despite the advantages of outstanding
organic coating, their disadvantages limit their further application.
Organic coatings have poor mechanical strength and thermal instability
and easily fall off from the substrate.17 Therefore, it is urgent to solve the problem of poor adhesion of
organic coatings prepared by dip-coating on the substrate. Moreover,
there is much room for further improvement of the coating quality
by optimizing the experimental parameters and freeze-drying.

Besides organic coating, dip-coating can also be used to prepare
inorganic coating such as silica sol–gel, Al2O3, ZrO2, and TiO2 coating.12,14 The inorganic coating can effectively enhance the corrosion resistance
of Mg alloys, and it possessed strong adhesive strength. However,
due to the sintering or drying process at high temperature, many pores
and microcracks formed on the surface of Mg alloys during the preparation
of the inorganic coating by dip-coating. Although the pretreatment
or UV-assisted treatment can slightly reduce the microcracks, the
defect of inorganic coating was still a problem which needs further
study.25 Even so, dip-coating was widely
applied because it is simple, fast, and preferably secure.

2.4 Electrodeposition
The electrodeposition
is an electrochemical treatment method and is divided into direct
electrodeposition and pulse electrodeposition.26 During the electrodeposition, Mg alloys are used as the
cathode of the electrolytic cell, and then the elements in electrolytes
will deposit on Mg alloys through oxidation and reduction. As a result,
a protective coating is formed on the surface of Mg alloys. Electrodeposition
is frequently used to prepare Ca–P coating.27 Hydroxyapatite (HA) is the most common Ca–P coating
because it is the main component of bone tissue. Based on HA, Dehghanian
et al.28 found that the silicon-substituted
hydroxyapatite behaved much better. The coating prepared by electrolyte
with the addition of 0.005 mol/L of SiO32– increased corrosion resistance
by 7 times and had better cell proliferation performance. The electrodeposited
coatings are compact and thin, but they are easily doped with an unexpected
element and then form new phases. It is also a good way to prepare
the new deposited coating on Mg alloys by changing the composition
of the electrolyte.

In addition to the electrolyte, electrodeposition
is influenced by many factors, such as the voltage, time, and duty
cycle. For instance, the surface roughness of the coating decreased
with the increase of voltage, but the coating was more difficult to
form; meanwhile, the increase of time can increase the thickness and
hydrophobicity of the coating and reduced the corrosion current density.29 The thickness and surface roughness of the coating
reduced with a decrease of duty cycle, while the hydrophobicity increased.26 Besides, pH values of electrolyte, temperature,
and the pretreatment of the Mg alloy also had an influence on the
formation of electrodeposited coating.30,31

Except
for the above four methods, there are many other anticorrosion
processing methods, such as electrospinning and magnetron sputtering.
However, the effect of a single anticorrosion processing method to
promote the properties of the Mg alloy is limited. Therefore, combining
two or more anticorrosion processing methods together to form the
composite coating on the surface of Mg alloys has become a trend.32

3 Functionalized Processing
3.1 Enhancement of Antibacterial Performance
In general,
the occurrence of fractures is always accompanied with
inflammation or infection. Therefore, it is desirable to provide Mg
alloys with antibacterial property. To our best knowledge, bacteria
can be killed by the high pH environment caused by degradation of
Mg and will not adhere to areas where the corrosion of Mg alloys is
active.33,34 However, the antibacterial ability of Mg
alloys is dramatically restricted in vivo due to the buffering effect
of human fluid and the control in the corrosion of Mg.

To reduce
the risk of inflammation and infection, Mg alloy loading with antibacterial
drug is a common choice as implants.5 However,
the use of antibiotics can induce drug resistance. Hence, a combination
of coating with the elements possessing antibacterial ability was
studied. Cu and Ag are common additive elements in the coating owing
to the inhibitory effect on the proteins in bacterial biofilm.35,36 Moreover, Zou et al.37 prepared a Zn-loaded
montmorillonite coating to improve the antibacterial properties of
AZ31. Besides the coating with antibacterial ions, Pei et al.38 prepared a carboxymethyl chitosan coating loaded
with heparin to make the surface of AZ31B functionalized, which exhibited
excellent antibacterial and anticoagulant properties. Wang et al.21 utilized the functionalized PU to improve the
antibacterial performance of Mg alloys. Overall, the coating containing
ions with antibacterial behavior (Cu2+, Ag+,
etc.) had great antibacterial performance. However, the development
of the antibacterial materials such as the functionalized chitosan
and PU is still necessary because those can avoid the potential toxic
side effect of heavy metal ions and provide more options for the applications
of Mg alloys under different environments.

3.2 Hydrophobization
The introduction
of hydrophobic property can reduce the contact area between Mg alloys
and water. The general way to introduce the hydrophobic property is
to form a hydrophobic surface on Mg alloys. Table 2 listed hydrophobization and the properties
of substrate after hydrophobization in some literature.39−48 It can be found that chemical modification is a common way to prepare
the hydrophobic coating. SA and FAS are the common materials in hydrophobic
coating. Except for organics, inorganic coating and the organic–inorganic
composite coating were studied to improve the corrosion resistance
of Mg alloys.

a Corrosion potential (Ecorr), corrosion

corrosion solution was NaCl.

As is well-known, different materials had different static contact
angles, and the level of static contact angle directly reflects the
degree of hydrophobicity of the material. Cui et al.40 formed a superhydrophobic zinc stearate coating on the
MAO-coated Mg-4Li-1Ca alloy by electrodeposition. The results showed
that the contact angle of zinc stearate coating reached 153.5°,
which was super hydrophobic. Xu et al.41 prepared a fluoroalkyl-silane coating on the AZ61 alloy. The contact
angle of coating increased from 30.9° to 165.2°. Meanwhile, Icorr of the Mg alloy reduced by 3 orders of
magnitude, while Ecorr only increased
from −1.5847 to −1.4221 V. Interestingly, the superhydrophilic
coatings exhibited great anticorrosion properties as well as superhydrophobic
coatings.47 Besides materials, the microstructure
of Mg alloys can also impact its hydrophobicity.48 Therefore, both the microstructure and coating materials
should be taken into consideration in order to control the hydrophobicity
of Mg alloys.

Functionalized processing is developing rapidly
with great potential
in the future. Except for the properties mentioned above, the coatings
with other properties have also been studied. For instance, Wang et
al.49 prepared the coating with great blood
biocompatibility and the property of endothelialization. Wang et al.50 manufactured the coating with good mineralization
ability on the Mg–Zn–Zr–Sr alloy. Therefore,
it is no doubt that the employment of functionalized processing promotes
the applications of Mg alloys in different fields.

4 Conclusion
Surface treatment is an effective method to improve
the performance
(appropriate degradation rate) of Mg alloys. It is desired to form
a protective layer on the surface of Mg alloys so that the corrosion
resistance of Mg alloys can be improved. To date, surface treatments
not only improve the corrosion resistance of the Mg alloy but also
can make Mg alloys functionalized. According to this, surface treatments
of Mg alloys can be divided into two parts: anticorrosion processing
and functionalized processing. The anticorrosion processing mainly
includes fluoride treatment, MAO, dip-coating, and electrodeposition,
and those methods can effectively improve the corrosion resistance
of Mg alloys. New properties (such as antibacterial and hydrophobic
properties) will be achieved for Mg alloys through the functionalized
processing.
