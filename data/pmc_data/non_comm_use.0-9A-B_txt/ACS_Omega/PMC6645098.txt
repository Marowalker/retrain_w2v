We
demonstrated room temperature near infrared (NIR) region random
lasing (RL) (800–950 nm), with a threshold of nearly 500 μW,
in ∼200 nm thick MoS2/Au nanoparticles (NPs)/ZnO
heterostructures using photoluminescence spectroscopy. The RL in the
above system arises mainly due to the following three reasons: (1)
enhanced multiple scattering because of Au/ZnO disordered structure,
(2) exciton–plasmon coupling because of Au NPs, and (3) enhanced
charge transfer from ZnO to thick MoS2 flakes. RL has recently
attracted tremendous interest because of its wide applications in
the field of telecommunication, spectroscopy, and specifically in
biomedical tissue imaging. This work provides new dimensions toward
realization of low power on-chip NIR random lasers made up of biocompatible
materials.

1 Introduction
Random
lasing (RL) is one of the lasing phenomena that arises due
to simultaneous action of optical gain and amplification by multiple
scattering.1−3 A random laser is different from a traditional laser
in the sense that the feedback amplification is not provided by a
cavity formed by reflection components, but by disorder-induced scattering.
Because of ease of its fabrication, it is gaining popularity in a
variety of applications like biomedical imaging and optical information
processing.2 Use of various plasmonic nanoparticles
(NPs) as well as the new class of host materials including semiconductors,
quantum dots, and so forth led to renewed interest in the area of
random lasers and their applications over last decade.2,4−6 RL in the spectral range from ultraviolet to visible
region has been explored in variety of materials in literature.4,5,7,8 However,
there are few reports about near infrared (NIR) RL so far, which has
the following advantages including telecommunication, spectroscopy,
displays, and biomedical tissue imaging.9−11 In addition, because
the NIR window of tissue imaging falls in the range 650–1300
nm, NIR lasing using biocompatible materials is extremely needed.

Two-dimensional (2D) transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have
recently attracted significant interest because of their intriguing
physical/chemical properties and have huge potential applications
in future optoelectronic, nanoelectronic, and spin-valleytronic devices.12−19 Among the 2D TMDs, molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) is very
promising candidate, which exhibits indirect optical band gap of 1.2
eV in bulk phase to direct band gap of 1.9 eV in monolayer limit.13,14,20,21 However, the relatively small
optical density of states and limited photon absorbing/emitting ability
of monolayer MoS2 restrict its practical device applications.22−24 The realization of lasing in the visible region has been already
reported in monolayer MoS2.25,26 As a counterpart
of monolayer species, a few layer MoS2 with thickness <100
nm (TnM) shows low luminescence quantum yield because of their indirect
band gap nature. However, thick MoS2 with thickness >100
nm (TkM) still holds some obvious superiorities compared with monolayer
in terms of stronger photon absorption ability, higher optical density
of states, and ability to withstand substantially higher injection
currents, which are advantageous for light-emitting devices and solar
energy conversion.23,27 Moreover, as MoS2 is
biocompatible and the indirect band gap of TkM lies in the NIR region,
it may be possible to build future optoelectronic devices using indirect
band gap emission for NIR application.23,28 However, RL
is not possible from MoS2 alone and needs an additional
charge-transfer medium to invoke population inversion.

ZnO exhibits
a direct wide band gap (∼3.37 eV) in the UV
region and defect-assisted deep level emission in the visible to NIR
region and hence is a very suitable material for tunable light emission
and photodetection.29−39 It has been shown that ZnO can be used to tune the optical properties
of 1L-TMDs by controlling the charge carrier density.40 This is due to the fact that the electronic band structures
of 1L-TMD/ZnO heterostructure (HS) form the type-II band alignment,
where the effective charge transfer occurs at the interface between
1L-TMDs and ZnO that would enhance the photoluminescence (PL) of 1L-TMDs.40−42 PL enhancement in the visible region has been observed in several
such HSs including MoS2/ZnO and WSe2/ZnO by
considering monolayer or few layer TMDs.40,43−45 However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no
report so far about the indirect band gap PL enhancement using TMD/ZnO
HSs.

In this work, we have prepared TkM/ZnO thin film HSs and
observed
enhanced indirect PL emission of MoS2. To further enhance
the indirect emission, we have incorporated Au NPs at the TkM/ZnO
interface and interestingly observed RL in the NIR region. To understand
the charge-transfer mechanism and to calculate lasing threshold, we
have studied excitation power-dependent PL spectra of TkM/Au/ZnO HSs.
On the basis of the above analysis, we have proposed a possible mechanism
for lasing in the above system. The demonstration of NIR RL with the
integration of MoS2, Au, and ZnO has potential to open
new dimensions toward future optical technologies because of their
biocompatibility, ease of fabrication, and on-chip fabrication suitability.

2 Materials and Methods
2.1 Synthesis of ZnO Thin Films
A sol–gel
process was employed for ZnO thin film deposition on glass substrate.
In particular, an equi-molar solution (2 M) of anhydrous zinc acetate
and ethanolamine in 2-methoxyethanol was spin coated on the glass
substrate at 3000 rpm. Here, ethanolamine has a role of stabilizer.
Spin-coated samples were annealed at 250 °C for throwing out
organic impurities and improving the adhesion of ZnO thin film with
the substrate. The deposition of 5 nm thick Au on these ZnO thin films
was subsequently carried out by using dc sputtering system [Quorum
(Q-150 RES)]. The thickness of Au coating was measured using inbuilt
crystal detectors. UV–visible absorption spectra were recorded
by a Cary 60 UV–vis spectrometer (Agilent Technologies) with
a range of wavelengths from 200 to 800 nm.

2.2 Preparation
of MoS2 Flakes and
TkM/Au/ZnO HSs
High-purity MoS2 crystal was procured
from Graphene Supermarket and mechanically exfoliated on 285 nm SiO2/Si, ZnO thin film and Au/ZnO to get desired HSs.

2.3 AFM, SEM, PL, and Raman Measurements
Atomic force microscope
(AFM) measurement was carried out in tapping
mode using Bruker edge dimension system. Scanning electron microscope
(SEM) measurements were carried out with Quanta 400 FEG SEM. TnM,
TkM, ZnO thin films, Au/ZnO, and TkM/Au/ZnO HSs were investigated
using PL and Raman spectroscopy (HORIBA LabRAM). All of the measurements
were carried out in a confocal microscopy setup using 488 nm continuous
wave laser with spot size ∼1 μm, in which we can readily
locate and selectively excite HSs of different layer thicknesses.

3 Results and Discussions
Figure 1a,b shows
the room-temperature PL spectra of TnM and TkM flakes transferred
on SiO2/Si substrates (corresponding AFM images are shown
in Figure S1). MoS2 multilayers
usually show two distinguishable peaks with peak positions at 1.84
and 1.35 eV.20,23,46 The peak observed at 1.84 eV with higher intensity corresponds to
A direct exciton transition, while the other peak at 1.35 eV with
lower intensity can be assigned to the indirect transition (i.e.,
transition of electrons from I-valley to K point).20,21 In contrast, TkM (thickness of ∼200 nm used in this work)
has shown interesting features with nearly equal probability for both
direct and indirect transitions. Additionally, the B direct exciton
transition was observed as a shoulder peak with peak position close
to 2.0 eV for both thin and thick flakes. In case of TnM the main
excitonic peak can be de-convoluted into two close peaks, that is,
A trion and A exciton (see Figure S2).
The origin of A– trion can be attributed to the
charge transfer from SiO2 substrate to MoS2,
which can be clearly seen as a red shift in the A peak position by
15 meV (close to trion binding energy).47,48 However, for
TkM films with thicknesses ∼210 nm, the substrate effect was
found to be negligible. The ratio of the peak intensities corresponding
to direct and indirect excitonic transitions were observed to be almost
invariant with the variation of excitation power. Room-temperature
Raman spectra measured on MoS2 flakes are shown in Figure S3. The Raman spectra of MoS2 consist of two characteristic peaks at 385 and 405 cm–1 corresponding to E2g and A1g modes, respectively.49 The difference in the Raman shift between these
two peaks was found to be ∼25 cm–1, which
is in good agreement with the previously reported value for TkM flakes.49,50 Similar to PL spectra, the peak positions were observed to be invariant
for different excitation power. In addition to this, the full-width
at half maximum for these peaks monotonically decreased with the decrease
in the excitation power.

SiO2/Si substrate using 488 nm laser. Excitation power-dependent
PL spectra of (a) TnM flakes with thickness ∼45 nm and (b)
TkM flakes with thickness ∼210 nm. Black, green, red, and blue
colors represent the laser excitation power of 100, 220, 490, and
1100 μW, respectively. Two distinguishable peaks are observed
for all flakes, in which peak at 1.84 eV corresponds to direct exciton
transition and at 1.35 eV corresponds to indirect transition.

To investigate the effect of ZnO
on MoS2 flakes, both
TnM and TkM were transferred onto sol–gel derived ZnO thin
films. The excitation power-dependent PL spectra of TnM/ZnO HSs were
observed to be dominated by ZnO emission in the range of 1.6–2.4
eV as shown in Figure S4 and did not show
well-defined emission in the NIR region. Therefore, it was not considered
for further analysis. On the other hand, the PL spectra of TkM/ZnO
HSs showed significant NIR emission as shown in Figure 2a. To probe deeper, we recorded the excitation
power-dependent PL spectra of TkM/ZnO HSs. The PL spectra of TkM/ZnO
HSs showed red shift of direct A transitions in comparison to TkM/SiO2 films (Figure 1b). MoS2/ZnO HSs exhibit type-II band alignment and therefore
band bending is expected to align the Fermi levels.41 The conduction band (CB) of MoS2 followed downward
band bending while making an interface with ZnO. Hence, the exciton
population of both layers were affected by the charge accumulation
at the interface and that made an impact on the ratio of indirect
to direct peak values for MoS2/ZnO HSs. The excitation
power-dependent red shift in the position of A exciton peak can be
assigned to the photo-induced modulation of MoS2 dielectric
function, thus resulting into the decrease of exciton binding energy.51 Tuning of A exciton transition of monolayer
MoS2 using ZnO thin film was demonstrated by Kim et al.
in MoS2/ZnO HSs.40Figure S5 shows the PL spectrum of TkM/ZnO HS
in the region of indirect transition only for laser excitation power
of 1100 μW. In contrast to pristine MoS2 films as
mentioned earlier, this HS showed signature of amplified spontaneous
emission (ASE) for the transitions related to I-valley as shown in Figure 2a for 1100 μW
power (the zoomed spectra corresponding to NIR region is shown in Figure S5). Additionally, the PL spectrum of
ZnO thin film is shown in Figure 2b in the range 1.2–2.4 eV, and it was found
to be luminescent in the visible and relatively nonluminescent in
the region of I-valley of MoS2. It must be noted here that
sol–gel processed ZnO is prone to defect states like oxygen
vacancies and interstitials,52,53 and hence, their interaction
with excitonic transitions of MoS2 cannot be ignored.

and Au-coated ZnO thin films (red squares) in the range 1.2–2.4

NIR emission is found to be significantly enhanced along with sharp
and narrow peaks over the envelope, which increases with the increase
in excitation power. Pink, magenta, purple, orange, black, green,
red, and blue colors represent the laser excitation power of 10, 50,
100, 220, 490, 890, 990, and 1100 μW, respectively. (d) Schematic
of TkM/Au NPs/ZnO HSs, in which mosaic red represents ZnO thin film,
blue flakes represent TkM and golden spheres represent Au NPs.

The observation of ASE in the
indirect exciton transition has triggered
its further exploration. It is well known that metal NPs are good
candidates for enhancing light scattering mainly because of surface
plasmon resonance.54−56 In the present work, we have strategically used Au
NPs to get enhanced scattering to have lasing. With the insertion
of Au between TkM and ZnO thin films, drastic change in the PL spectra
was observed as shown in Figure 2c. The schematic of TkM/Au NPs/ZnO HS is shown in Figure 2d. The corresponding
AFM image is shown in Figure S6. Figure S7 shows the typical SEM image of the
TkM/Au/ZnO HS. Interestingly, significant enhancement in the emissions
corresponding to the I-valley was observed (Figure 2c) along with sharp and narrow peaks over
the envelope, which was found to be excitation power dependent. Such
features were found to be absent both in pristine MoS2 and
TkM/ZnO HS. In addition, a red shift was observed in the peak corresponding
to A direct transitions, which was also found to increase with increase
in excitation power.

Figure 3a presents
the excitation power-dependent emission in the NIR region of TkM/Au/ZnO
HS by varying laser power in the range 10–1100 μW. It
was found that the emission intensity increased abruptly beyond excitation
power of 490 μW along with the emergence of sharp spike-like
peaks over the entire envelope. At lower excitation power (<490
μW), no such sharp peaks were observed. The appearance of the
sharp spike-like peaks indicates that RL occurs due to recurrent scattering
in the disordered medium of TkM/Au/ZnO. It was observed that the position
and intensities of these spike-like peaks were fluctuating for different
readings, which is the characteristic of nonresonant feedback.2 There could be three possible reasons for the
origin of such peaks: (1) Fabry–Perot, (2) whispering gallery
mode, and (3) RL. As the surface of Au/ZnO is not smooth enough, existence
of Fabry–Perot between TkM and Au/ZnO can be neglected. Secondly,
whispering gallery mode can also be discarded because of irregular
geometry of TkM flakes. Hence, the possible mechanism can be RL only.
We have carried out fast Fourier transform analysis for the PL spectra
recorded with 1100 μW excitation power. Two side peaks along
with the central peak can be clearly seen in the Figure S8, which confirms that the peaks are due to RL and
not the noise. The increase in the lasing intensity was found to be
nonlinear in nature, as shown in Figure 3b. The change in PL intensity versus excitation
power showed an increase in slope indicating the onset of lasing and
the lasing threshold was estimated to be approximately 500 μW.

Figure 3 (a) Excitation
power-dependent NIR emission of TkM/Au/ZnO HSs.
The spectra are plotted in waterfall mode for clarity. Pink, magenta,
purple, orange, black, green, red, and blue colors represent the laser
excitation power of 10, 50, 100, 220, 490, 890, 990, and 1100 μW,
respectively. (b) PL intensity vs excitation power of above HSs. The
lasing threshold has been estimated to be ∼500 μW.

On the basis of the feedback mechanism,
RL can be categorized into
two types: incoherent when it is phase insensitive and coherent when
it is phase sensitive. In a strongly scattering system, multiple scattering
facilitates light of wavelength λ to return to the same coherence
volume λ3 it has visited before, thereby providing
field feedback for lasing.6,57,58 The lasing frequencies can be determined by the interference of
scattered light returning via different paths.2 On the basis of the above analysis, we propose the possible mechanism
as shown in Figure 4.

Figure 4 Schematic showing the possible mechanism of RL in TkM/Au/ZnO HSs.
Band bending at TkM/ZnO junction results in the charge accumulation
in the CB of TkM at the interface, however not sufficient enough for
the system to lase. Incorporation of Au NPs (golden spheres) between
TkM and ZnO results in lasing possibly due to three following effects,
that is, enhanced multiple scattering because of Au/ZnO disordered
structure, exciton–plasmon coupling because of Au NPs, and
enhanced charge transfer from ZnO to thick MoS2.

As mentioned earlier, band bending
at the TkM/ZnO junction results
in the charge accumulation in the CB of TkM at the interface. However,
the charge accumulation was not sufficient enough for the system to
lase. Incorporation of Au NPs between TkM and ZnO resulted in lasing
possibly because of three following effects: (1) enhanced multiple
scattering, (2) exciton–plasmon coupling, and (3) enhanced
charge transfer from ZnO to TkM. It is well reported that plasmon
resonance of Au NPs can couple with ZnO excitons (the absorption spectra
of ZnO and Au/ZnO is shown in Figure S9; it can be clearly seen that the plasmon resonance peak is present
nearly at 528 nm), thereby improving radiative recombination.59 Because of the difference in work function and
electron affinity between ZnO and MoS2, electrons present
in the ZnO may diffuse into TkM at the interface to match the Fermi
levels, which can yield depletion region in the ZnO side and a negatively
charged carrier accumulation region in the MoS2 side. Additionally,
the presence of Au will promote the band bending and therefore enforce
charge accumulation at MoS2 CB. Electrons present at defect
states of ZnO can be transferred to the Au Fermi level and then to
MoS2 CBs, specifically I-valley, as the later is well matched
with the Fermi level of Au. For better understanding, we have recorded
the PL spectra using 632 nm laser and found no RL which indicates
clear involvement of Au NPs for achieving lasing (shown in Figure S10).

Raman spectra for TkM/Au/ZnO
HSs are shown in Figure S11. In contrast
to Raman spectra of pristine MoS2 flakes, here a systematic
red shift in the peak positions
corresponding to E2g and A1g modes was observed.
The shift in E2g mode can be assigned to strain induced
due to rough ZnO thin films. Moreover, the shift in A1g peak toward lower energy suggests electron transfer from Au/ZnO
to TkM.41,51

4 Conclusions
In conclusion,
we demonstrated RL action from MoS2/Au/ZnO
HS in the NIR region. Thick-layer MoS2 flakes were found
to be a potential candidate for NIR emission. The thick-layer MoS2 flakes while transferred onto ZnO thin films resulted in
enhanced indirect emission. To enhance the PL emission further, Au
NPs were incorporated at the interface between TkM and ZnO. The resulting
TkM/Au/ZnO HS was found to lase in the NIR region (800–950
nm) with lasing threshold of nearly 500 μW. Enhanced multiple
scattering because of Au/ZnO disordered structure, exciton–plasmon
coupling because of Au NPs, and enhanced charge transfer from ZnO
to thick MoS2 could be the possible reasons for RL in the
above HS. The present work opens up new dimensions toward realization
of low power on-chip NIR random lasers made up of biocompatible materials.
