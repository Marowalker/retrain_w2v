Luteolin
(LT) is a poorly soluble bioactive compound that suffered
bioavailability problems after oral administration. Hence, the aim
of the proposed research work was to formulate and investigate various
solid dispersions (SDs) of LT in order to enhance its dissolution
and bioactivity. LT-SD was prepared using polyethylene glycol 4000
(PEG 4000) as a carrier at the mass ratios of 1:1, 1:2, and 1:4. LT-SD
was prepared using different methods including fusion (FU), solvent
evaporation (SE), and microwave irradiation (MI) methods. The prepared
LT-SD was duly characterized in terms of differential scanning calorimetry
(DSC), X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM),
infrared (IR) spectroscopy, and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and
evaluated for dissolution and in vitro antioxidant activity. The results
of DSC, XRD, SEM, IR, and NMR suggested the formation of LT-SD. After
90 min of the dissolution study, the results displayed that the %
release of LT from prepared SD was significantly higher compared with
the pure LT and its physical mixture dispersion (PMD). LT-SD prepared
using the MI method displayed the maximum release of LT (i.e., 97.78
± 4.41%) at a 1:2 mass ratio of LT:PEG 4000. The LT-SD prepared
using the SE method displayed the maximum release of 93.78 ±
3.98% at a mass ratio of 1:4 of LT:PEG 4000. The SD prepared by the
MI method showed enhanced dissolution due to higher aqueous solubility
and the reduction of particle size. The solid-state characterization
studies (DSC, XRD, SEM, IR, and NMR studies) suggested the morphological
conversion of LT into the amorphous form from the crystalline state.
The results of the antioxidant study revealed that the formation LT-SD
displayed significantly higher radical scavenging activity than the
pure LT. Therefore, SD obtained using PEG 4000 could be a potential
strategy for maximizing the solubility, in vitro dissolution, and
therapeutic efficacy of LT.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Luteolin (LT) (molecular
structure: Figure 1A; chemical name: 2-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-5,7-dihydroxychromen-4-one
and CAS registry number: 491-70-3) is a light yellow-colored crystalline
powder that comes under the class of bioflavonoids.1 The molecular formula and molecular weight of LT are C15H10O6 and 286.24 g/mol, respectively.1,2 It can be found in many plants including celery, perilla leaf, chamomile
tea, and green pepper.3,4 Several potential pharmaceutical
and therapeutic applications for LT have been reported, but it experiences
the problem of formulation development due to its weak aqueous solubility.5,6 Moreover, the poor solubility (1.93 × 10–5 mol/kg at 20 °C) and stability of LT in water severely restricts
its applications in the development of pharmaceutical products.7

Solid dispersion (SD) technology has been used
extensively in maximizing
the solubility, in vitro dissolution rate, and bioavailability of
poorly soluble drugs.8,9 The crystalline form of such drugs
can be transformed into the amorphous form using SD technology.10 Numerous studies have highlighted the advantages
of SD in the enhancement of the solubility and dissolution rate of
drugs with poor water solubility.11−13

Polyethylene glycols
(PEGs) with molecular weights of 1500–20,000
are commonly used in the manufacturing of SD. The solubility of PEGs
in water is normally good, but it decreases with an increase in the
molar mass of PEGs. The specific benefit of PEGs in the preparation
of SD is that these carriers are also miscible/soluble in commonly
used organic solvents. The melting points of PEGs of importance lie
under 65 °C in each case (e.g., the melting ranges of PEG 1000,
PEG 4000, and PEG 6000 are 30–40, 50–58, and 55–63
°C, respectively).14 The lower melting
points of PEGs are helpful in the manufacturing of SD by the different
methods. Furthermore, they are also able to improve the wettability
of poorly soluble compounds.15

The
SDs of poorly soluble compounds can be prepared using an inert
hydrophilic carrier by various methods such as the fusion (FU), solvent
evaporation (SE), and microwave irradiation (MI) methods.16 The identification of the physical state of
the drug in SD is important. Various sophisticated techniques including
differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), X-ray diffraction (XRD),
and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) are commonly used
techniques for the characterization of SDs.

Some pharmaceutical
approaches such as co-crystal technology,17,18 cyclodextrin complexation,19,20 phospholipid complexation,21 polymeric micelles,5 and nanoparticulate drug delivery system22 have been studied to enhance the solubility, dissolution rate, and
bioavailability of LT in the literature. A co-solvent approach had
also been attempted in order to enhance the solubility and physicochemical
profile of LT.6 In this study, LT-SD was
prepared using different methods (FU, SE, and MI) using PEG 4000 (Figure 1B) as a carrier in
the different mass ratios. The developed LT-SDs were optimized by
the dissolution study to select the best formulation (from each method)
and further characterized for their physicochemical parameters with
DSC, XRD, FTIR, and SEM. Finally, the in vitro antioxidant study was
also explored to check the antioxidant potential of the developed
LT-SD.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Preparation
of LT-SD
Different SDs
of LT were prepared using three different methods, namely, FU, SE,
and MI methods. The SE method involves the solubility/miscibility
of LT and PEG 4000 as a carrier in absolute ethanol, and then the
organic solvent was evaporated in a water bath. The key point of this
method was to ensure complete solubility/miscibility of LT in the
carrier and disperse uniformly. In the case of the MI method, the
heat is produced, which can allow for penetrating any material at
any point of the sample at the same time. The microwave energies produced
by MI can influence the crystalline structure of the drug molecule.
The time of exposure had great importance in achieving the amorphous
form of the drug, which results in enhanced dissolution rate of the
drug.23 The time of a microwave oven can
be fixed, but MI energies could not be fixed. This method has the
main advantage of not using organic solvents and the absence of any
risk originating from the residual solvents.

The formulation
LT-SD was obtained with the carrier (PEG 4000) at the different mass
ratios of 1:1, 1:2, and 1:4 using different techniques. The mass ratios
of 1:1, 1:2, and 1:4 were selected randomly as there is no issue of
miscibility/solubility of PEG 4000 with most of the organic solvents
used in the preparation of SD.15 PEG 4000
is easily miscible/soluble in organic solvents.14 In the preparation of SDs, the drugs and polymers are separately
dissolved in organic solvents. Then, the drug solutions and polymer
solutions are mixed together, and organic solvents are evaporated
in order to obtain SDs. Because the solid drug is finally dispersed
into the solid polymer in SD, the solubility/miscibility of the drug
in a polymer, i.e., PEG 4000, is not important.8 Hence, the solubility/miscibility studies between LT and
PEG 4000 were not carried out in this study. Nevertheless, LT has
been reported as freely soluble in PEG 4000, and the solubility of
the solute is enhanced with enhancement in the molar mass of the carrier,
i.e., PEG 4000 in this case.6 Therefore,
LT will also be freely or very soluble in PEG 4000. Therefore, the
miscibility/solubility of LT in PEG 4000 was not an issue. PEG is
the most commonly used polymer for the preparation of SD. It offers
various advantages over other hydrophilic carriers including low melting
point (50–60 °C), rapid solidification rate, and capability
of forming solid drug solutions.24,25 The effect
of various mass ratios on LT dissolution was chosen as the indicator
for its evaluation.

2.2 DSC Studies
DSC
is a commonly used
thermal analysis method due to its capability to provide detailed
information about the physical properties. The DSC thermograms of
LT, PEG 4000, LT-physical mixture dispersion (PMD), and LT-SDs (LT-FUD,
LT-SED, and LT-MID) are presented in Figure 2. The thermal curve of LT presented a sharp
and crystalline endothermic peak at 341.4 °C, corresponding to
its melting temperature. PEG 4000 showed a characteristic peak at
62.7 °C, corresponding to melting temperature of PEG 4000. The
melting temperature of LT has been reported as 338.4 °C.6 The melting temperature and DSC thermogram of
LT recorded in this study were very close with those reported in the
literature. The DSC curve of the different LT-SDs (LT-FUD, LT-SED,
and LT-MID) and PMD showed the endothermic peaks near to the melting
temperature of PEG 4000. However, the crystalline peak of LT disappeared
in all SDs as well as in PMD. The disappearance of the LT peak in
SDs and PMD could be attributed to the molecular dispersion of LT
in PEG 4000 and converted to the amorphous state, so there is no definite
melting temperature of LT that was observed.

Figure 2 DSC thermograms of LT,
PEG 4000, LT-PMD, LT-FUD, LT-MID, and LT-SED.

2.3 XRD Studies
The XRD diffractogram
of LT, PEG 4000, LT-PMD, and LT-SDs (LT-FUD, LT-SED, and LT-MID) are
presented in Figure 3. The XRD spectra of LT showed various intense peaks at 14.3°,
16.1°, 26.1°, 29.2°, and 27.6° at a diffraction
angle range of 5–50°, suggesting that LT was present in
the crystalline form. The recorded XRD peaks of LT were in accordance
with those reported in the literature.6 However, the polymer PEG 4000 presented the diffraction peaks at
20.6° and 23.5° only. The diffraction peak intensity of
LT-PMD weakens in comparison to pure LT, but many diffraction peaks
still remained compared with PEG 4000. This observation suggested
that some amount of the LT was still in the crystalline form in PMD.
The diffraction pattern of LT-SDs (LT-FUD, LT-SED, and LT-MID) presented
the complete disappearance of the characteristic peaks of LT. The
disappearance of the characteristic peaks of LT suggested that LT
is completely dispersed in the PEG 4000 carrier and converted to the
amorphous state. Only the characteristic peaks of the carrier were
observed in the LT-SDs, which suggested the absence of any physical
interaction between LT and PEG 4000.

Figure 3 XRD spectra of LT, PEG 4000, LT-PMD, LT-FUD,
LT-MID, and LT-SED.

2.4 SEM Studies
To study the surface
morphology of various SDs, SEM study was carried out, and these images
are depicted in Figure 4A–F. Figure 4A depicts the image of pure LT, and the particles were found to be
in the crystal shape, and the carrier PEG 4000 (Figure 4B) exists as irregularly shaped particles
with smooth surfaces. The formulation LT-PMD displayed the presence
of LT crystals surrounded by PEG 4000 (Figure 4C). The images of LT-FUD (Figure 4D), LT-SED (Figure 4E), and LT-MID (Figure 4F) showed the irregularly
shaped particles, and the surface was found to be rough and irregular.
It confirms that LT had lost its crystalline structure, suggesting
the conversion to the amorphous form. The formation of a new and different
solid state is indicated by the changes and modification of drug particle
shapes in the SD.26 The same size of LD-SD
was not achieved for each method as suggested by SEM images. The molecular
interaction between LT and PEG 4000 is expected to be different in
different methods. Therefore, the size of SDs in each method was not
the same. From this study, it has been inferred that the particle
size of LT reduced markedly with variable degrees.

and (B) PEG 4000, (C) LT-PMD and (D) LT-FUD,
and (E) LT-SED and (F) LT-MID.

2.5 FTIR Analysis
The FTIR spectra of
LT-SDs (LT-FUD, LT-SED, and LT-MID) were used to interpret the newly
formed bonds between LT and PEG 4000 in the solid state as shown in Figure 5. It has been reported
that different molecules have a particular IR spectrum, which is being
used as a fingerprint.27 The pure LT spectra
showed sharp characteristic peaks attributed to the phenolic hydroxyl
group (Ar–OH) stretching vibration at 2878 cm–1. The spectra also showed a distinct peak at 1606, 1447, 1341, 1302,
951, and 844 cm–1, which is ascribed to C=O
stretching, C=C aromatic stretching, C–O–C pyran
ring, and C–H aromatic bending. The FTIR peaks of LT were found
in accordance with those reported in the literature.20 The carrier PEG 4000 has shown vibrational peaks at 3316
and 1087 cm–1, suggesting vibrational stretching
of O–H and C–O–C, respectively. The characteristic
peaks obtained at 1045, 1379, 2972.5, and 3317 cm–1 are assigned to C–O, C=O, C–H, and O–H,
respectively.23 In LT-SD, all assigned
peaks displayed no significant variation compared to the pure LT,
suggesting the possibility of H-bonding with C=C. No clear
shifts in the vibrational bands were observed in the LT with PEG 4000.
The C=O stretching vibration for LT-SD was slightly shifted
to 1665 and 1607 cm–1 due to stretching vibrations.
The other characteristic peaks for LT-SDs were found at 1447 and 1340
cm–1 (C=C aromatic bending), 949 and 944
cm–1 (C–H aromatic bending), which showed
a similar peak range as compared to pure LT. The spectra of PMD were
found to be identical, and the main absorption bands of LT appeared
in all the spectra in the region of absorption around 2879 cm–1. The distinct peak in the region is due to phenolic
−OH stretching vibration. This indicated that there was no
distinction between the internal structures and the conformation of
these samples at the molecular level.

and LT-SDs (LT-FUD, LT-SED,
and LT-MID).

2.6 Nuclear
Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Studies
The proton-NMR (1H-NMR)
and carbon-NMR (13C-NMR) of LT, PEG 4000,
LT-PMD, LT-FUD, LT-MID, and LT-SED were executed to examine the complex
genesis, and the chemical shift of entire samples depicted in Figure 6A,B. The 1H-NMR spectra
of pure LT in deuterated dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO-d6) presented a sharp deshielded singlet at 12.99 ppm,
which attributed to the C-5 OH proton of flavonoids. The rest of the
hydroxyl group displayed a broad singlet at δ 9.46, 9.90, and
10.80 ppm. The aromatic carbon depicted double doublet peaks at 7.41–7.43
ppm for the pure LT, and the pyran ring showed a definite singlet
peak at δ 6.67 ppm. The carrier PEG 4000 presented the chemical
shift values for tertiary methylene at δ 3.42–3.43 and
3.61–3.63 ppm. The singlet peak for the hydroxyl group of the
carrier lies at δ 4.57 ppm.

LT-MID, and LT-SID.
(B) 13C NMR spectra of LT, PEG 4000, LT-PMD, LT-MID, and LT-SID.

In contrast, the formulations LT-PMD, LT-FUD, LT-MID,
and LT-SED
expressed a slight change for the chemical shift values of the hydroxyl
group having a singlet δ value of 12.99, 12.98, 12.99, and 12.99
ppm, respectively. The aromatic ring of the flavones attached to −OH
group for LT-PMD, LT-FUD, LT-MID, and LT-SED exhibited a minor change
in the number of protons as compared to pure LT having a δ value
in between 7.41 and 7.43 ppm. The pyran ring also showed a definite
singlet peak at δ 6.67 and 6.68 ppm, concluding that there is
no interaction between the pure LT and the developed LT-PMD, LT-FUD,
LT-MID, and LT-SED. Also, the carrier PEG 4000 further enhances the
solubility of the formulations without having any interaction with
the pure LT. The chemical shift values of the developed formulations
exhibited a multiplet peak at δ 3.24–3.90 ppm, expressing
the enhanced solubility as compared to the pure drug. The NMR spectrum
of compounds could be assigned to a change in the structure of the
molecule to observe the interaction and solubility with the polymer
from the original pure drug. A lot of new signals were observed along
with slight shifts in the original signals in the δ range of
δ 3.24–3.90 ppm. This evidence concludes that the solubility
properties of the LT-SDs have increased as compared to pure LT.16,20 Based on the 1H-NMR and 13C-NMR value, LT-MID showed the best formulation
with the lesser chemical shift as compared to pure LT and PEG 4000.

2.7 Dissolution Study
The in vitro drug
release profile of LT from pure LT, LT-PMD, and LT-SDs (LT-FUD, LT-SED,
and LT-MID) at three different mass ratios (1:1, 1:2, and 1:4) were
performed, and results are presented in Figure 7A–E. The results showed
significant enhancement in the drug release in the prepared LT-SD
and PMD than pure LT in 90 min of study. The % release of pure LT
was found to be 13.11 ± 0.83, whereas PMD (1:1, 1:2, and 1:4)
showed drug release between 32.36 ± 2.83 and 44.76 ± 3.14%
(Figure 7A), respectively.
The PMD exhibited a higher dissolution rate compared to the pure LT,
which might be due to the enhanced solubilization potential of PEG
4000. The SD formulation prepared by the FU method (LT-FUD) depicted
the drug release between 47.78 ± 3.91 and 56.23 ± 2.45%
(Figure 7B), the SE
method (LT-SED) showed 82.43 ± 3.91 and 93.78 ± 4.22% (Figure 7C), and the MI method
(LT-MID) showed 86.21 ± 3.43 and 97.78 ± 3.98% (Figure 7D) at three different
mass ratios. These results suggested that the use of PEG 4000 as the
carrier and transformation of the LT crystal to the amorphous state
could definitely result in an enhancement in the solubility of LT.
The hydrophilic polymer encapsulates the drug and helps to solubilize
the drug readily due to its rapid contact with the dissolution media.28

Figure 7 In vitro dissolution study of
(A) LT and LT-PMD, (B) LT and LT-FUD, (C) LT and LT-SED, (D) LT and
LT-MID, and (E) LT and LT-SDs (LT-PMD; 1:2), (LT-MID; 1:2), (LT-SDD;
1:4), and (LT-FUD; 1:2).

The trend observed for
LT release from its dispersions was found
highest in LT-MID followed by LT-SED > LT-FUD > LT-PMD. Among
all
prepared LT-SDs, the maximum release was found with LT-SD prepared
by the MI method using an LT:PEG 4000 ratio of 1:2 (97.78 ± 4.4%)
followed by the formulation prepared by the SE method using an LT:PEG
4000 ratio of 1:4 (93.78 ± 3.98%) (Figure 7E). The formulation LT-MID showed the maximum
drug release at an LT:PEG ratio of 1:2. Overall, the release of LD
from all SDs was much higher than pure LT. The most probable reasons
for the enhancement in the dissolution rate of LT from all SDs are
due to the amorphization of LT.16 However,
the highest release of LT from LT-MID could be possible due to maximum
amorphization of LT by microwave rays, improved surfactant, and wetting
characteristics of PEG 400 with LT.16,23 The electromagnetic
waves of microwave pass through the material and cause the molecules
to oscillate, generating heat at each point of the material by the
interaction of the electromagnetic field with its molecular and electronic
structure. The microwave penetrates, allows the production of heat
throughout the sample at the same rate resulting in uniform volumetric
heating, and provides SD with better intimate contact between LT and
PEG 4000.15,29 Further, the drug release data were fitted to different
release kinetic models, and results are summarized in Table 1. The r2 values were observed minimum for the zero-order model for
all SDs. However, the r2 values were obtained
maximum in the case of a matrix-diffusion model for all SDs. Hence,
the best fit model was a matrix-diffusion model for all the prepared
SDs. The similarity factor (f2) value was estimated
for pure LT, PMD, and optimized SDs in order to evaluate the statistical
differences of the PMD and optimized SDs with that of pure LT. In
vitro dissolution profiles of optimized SDs and PMD in comparison
with pure LT are presented in Figure 7E. The estimated f2 values for pure
LT and different formulations are summarized in Table 2. It was observed that the f2 values for PMD and optimized SDs were greater than 50, suggesting
that the dissolution curves of PMD and optimized SDs are statistically
different with that of pure LT (p < 0.05).

2.8 Antioxidant
Activity
The 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl
(DPPH) radical scavenging activities of LT and LT-SDs (LT-FUD, LT-SED,
and LT-MID) with a fixed LT-PEG 4000 mass ratio (1:2) were evaluated,
and the results are depicted in Figure 8. The result of the study showed a significant increase
(p < 0.05) of DPPH radical scavenging activity
for LT-SDs (LT-FUD, LT-SED, and LT-MID) than pure LT (61.12 ±
4.11%). Among the three prepared SD, the highest DPPH radical scavenging
activities showed by LT-MID is 94.14 ± 6.11% followed by LT-SED
(88.55 ± 3.98%). The DPPH radical scavenging activity of LT-MID
and LT-SED was found significantly higher than that of LT-FUD (76.23
± 5.12) and pure LT (p < 0.05). The significant
higher antioxidant activity result was achieved due to the higher
solubility of LT in the used carrier PEG 4000. The formulation LT-MID
showed the highest activity due to the greater improvement in solubility
and dissolution due to the amorphization of LT by microwave rays.
It has been reported that the antioxidants have the ability to donate
the H+ or e– to DPPH and convert DPPH
into DPPH-H; hence, the antioxidant activity of antioxidants is mainly
associated with e– or H+ donating ability.30 In LT-SD, the electrons increase its scavenging
abilities of oxidants and free radicals.31 The results of the study revealed that the formation of LT-SD (a
bioflavonoid) showed good radical scavenging activity and antioxidant
activities.

and LT-MID).

3 Conclusions
The formulations LT-SDs were prepared by FU, SE, and MI methods
using PEG 4000 as a carrier to enhance the dissolution rate and antioxidant
activity of LT. Prepared SDs of LT were characterized using DSC, XRD,
SEM, FTIR, and NMR studies. The result of the study revealed significant
enhancement in the dissolution rate of LT from SD (p < 0.05). The greater dissolution enhancement of LT was achieved
from SD prepared by the MI method at an LT:PEG 4000 ratio of 1:2.
The DSC and XRD study confirms the transformation of a crystalline
state of LT to an amorphous state. The IR study spectra revealed no
interaction between LT and PEG 4000. The highest antioxidant activity
was also achieved by LT-SD prepared by the MI method. Overall, the
results of our study supported the proclaimed claims of the MI method
as an effective and solvent-free alternative for preparing SDs for
poorly soluble drugs such as LT.

4 Material
and Methods
4.1 Materials
LT (purity 99.0%) was purchased
from Beijing Mesochem Technology Co. Pvt. Ltd. (Beijing, China). PEG
4000 (purity 99.0%) was procured from E-Merck (Darmstadt, Germany).
High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) grade ethanol (purity
99.9%) was purchased from Sigma Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). The
chemicals used in the study were of analytical/pharmaceutical grade
with high purity.

4.2 Preparation of Physical
Mixture
The
PMD was prepared by mixing LT and PEG 4000 in the different mass ratios
(1:1, 1:2, and 1:4) with the trituration method to get a homogeneous
mixture, which was coded as LT-PMD. The obtained LT-PMDs were sieved
using sieve no. 45 to obtain uniform particles and stored in a desiccator
till further evaluation.23

4.3 Preparation of LT-SD
In this work,
the SDs of LT were obtained using three different technologies including
FU, SE, and MI techniques. The preparation of drug-carrier dispersions
is easy and convenient in terms of mass ratio and molar ratio. Therefore,
these mass ratios were prepared in mass ratio in this study.23 The composition of LT-SDs prepared using three
different techniques is summarized in Table 3.

4.3.1 FU
Method
LT-SD was prepared by
the FU method using the different ratios of LT to PEG 4000, which
was coded as LT-FUD. PEG 4000 with different mass ratios (1:1, 1:2,
and 1:4) was taken and heated to a molten state at 60 °C, and
the calculated amount of LT was included. The molten mass was continuously
stirred with a glass rod till complete dissolution of LT. The obtained
dispersion was solidified at ambient temperature. The dispersion was
transferred in a desiccator for 24 h and then pulverized using a porcelain
mortar and pestle. The obtained mass was sieved again using sieve
no. 45 to obtain the particles of uniform size.32

4.3.2 SE Method
The
SD of LT was prepared
by the SE method in different ratios of LT to PEG 4000, which was
coded as LT-SED. LT:PEG 4000 with three different mass ratios (1:1,
1:2, and 1:4) was taken. LT and PEG 4000 were dispensed into a beaker in which the required
amount ethanol was added for the dissolution of LT and PEG 4000. The
beaker was kept in a water bath held at 60 °C to evaporate the
organic solvent. The organic solvents from the SDs are usually evaporated
using a rotary evaporator in order to prevent the release in the environment.33,34 Nevertheless, in the preparation of SDs of drugs, organic solvents
are evaporated completely with a rapid evaporation rate, which cannot
be achieved using a rotary evaporator. For the rapid evaporation of
organic solvents from SDs, some other techniques such as water bath
or tray dryer have been used.35,36 Therefore, the SDs
of LT were prepared in beakers, which were subjected to water bath
for the evaporation of organic solvents instead of using a rotary
evaporator.16,35,36 The preparation was cooled in ice and solidified for 12 h, and the
obtained mass was stored and then pulverized using a pestle and mortar.
The obtained mass was sieved using sieve no. 45 in order to obtain
the particles of uniform size.16

4.3.3 MI Method
MI activated SDs of LT
were prepared in different ratios of LT to PEG 4000 which were coded
as LT-MID. The mixture of LT:PEG 4000 in the different mass ratios
(1:1, 1:2, and 1:4) with a batch size of 1.0 g was taken into a glass
beaker and subjected to microwaves at 500 W power in a microwave oven
(Samsung Model ME0113M1). Only one beaker was microwaved at a point
in time. The obtained masses were grounded using a glass mortar, and
the then pulverized powder was sieved using sieve no. 45 in order
to obtain the particles of uniform size.23

4.4 DSC
During the course of SD formation,
various endothermic and exothermic changes could occur, which can
be identified using a thermoanalytical method such as DSC.20 The thermal characteristics of LT, PEG 4000,
PMD, and LT-SD (LT-FUD, LT-SED, and LT-MID) were assessed using a
DSC (DSC-8000, Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA, USA). Each sample was accurately
weighed into sealed aluminum pans, and the blank pan was used as a
reference. The temperature range used for such study was 25–400
°C with a heating rate of 5 °C/min. The nitrogen gas was
purged with a flow rate of 50 mL/min. The thermograms of LT and PEG
4000 were compared with the prepared LT-SD (LT-FUD, LT-SED, and LT-MID)
for comparative evaluation of the changes in the thermal behavior
of LT in various SDs.

4.5 XRD
The variations
in the crystallinity
of LT in various SDs can be identified using diffraction techniques
such as XRD.23 The crystallinity of LT,
PMD, and LT-SD (LT-FUD, LT-SED, and LT-MID) was obtained using a diffractometer.
The XRD spectra of LT, PMD, and LT-SD (LT-FUD, LT-SED, and LT-MID)
were obtained using a diffractometer (Ultima IV diffractometer; Rigaku
Inc. Tokyo, Japan) with a copper anode (Cu Kα radiation). The
voltage and current for recording XRD spectra were set at 40 kV and
25 mA, respectively. These spectra were obtained at a step width of
0.05 °C and a diffraction angle between 3 and 60°. The results
were interpreted based on the peak intensities of each sample recorded
at various diffraction angles.

4.6 SEM
The surface morphology of prepared
LT, PEG 4000, PMD and SDs (LT-FUD, LT-SED, and LT-MID) were determined
by a SEM Zeiss EVO LS10 (Cambridge, UK).16 Each sample was sputter-coated using gold primarily and examined
at an accelerating voltage of 1.6 kV.

4.7 FTIR
Spectroscopic Analysis
The FTIR
spectra of powdered samples of LT, PMD, and LT-SDs (LT-FUD, LT-SED,
and LT-MID) were obtained using a spectrophotometer (Perkin Elmer,
Marlborough, MA, USA) by the potassium bromide (KBr, 150 bar) pellet
method.27 The sample equivalent to LT (5
mg) was mixed with about 100 mg of KBr using a clean glass pestle
and mortar. The obtained mixtures were compressed in order to obtain
the pellets. The samples were scanned in the scanning range of 450–4000
cm–1, with a resolution of 1 cm –1 using blank KBr. The results were interpreted by comparing the FTIR
peaks of pure samples with those of prepared SDs.

4.8 NMR
To determine the nature of the
proton or protonated group in LT, PEG 4000, LT-PMD, and LT-SDs (LT-FUD,
LT-SED, and LT-MID), the 1H-NMR and 13C-NMR spectra in DMSO-d6 were recorded.20 The study was performed using a Bruker Avance NMR spectrometer using
tetramethylsilane (TMS) as a standard. The chemical shift of LT-SD
compared with the pure LT and PEG 4000 was determined to illustrate
the mechanism of SD formation. This study was carried out to understand
the mechanism of interaction of protons of LT with the PEG 4000. The
samples were evaluated for one-dimensional 1H-NMR and 13C-NMR at 700
and 176 MHz, respectively. These spectra were taken using software
topspin 3.2.

4.9 Dissolution Study
The in vitro dissolution
study of pure LT, PMD, and SDs (LT-FUD, LT-SED, and LT-MID) was performed
using a dissolution apparatus.37 The dissolution
media was composed of 0.1 N HCl (900 mL) at 37 ± 0.5 °C
with a stirring speed of 100 rpm. These studies were performed in
0.1 N HCl in order to simulate acidic gastric conditions and to maintain
sink conditions throughout the dissolution test. All the formulations
(containing 50 mg of LT) and pure LT (50 mg) were immersed in the
dissolution media. The sample solution (5 mL) was withdrawn at a specific
time interval (5, 10, 15, 30, 45, 60, and 90 min) and filtered with
a 0.45 μm filter. Furthermore, the preheated fresh medium of
an equal volume was added to maintain the same volume throughout the
study. The concentration of LT in each withdrawn sample was determined
using a UV spectrophotometer. The cumulative drug release rate was
obtained by constructing the graphs between the amounts of drug release
vs time. The release mechanism of LT-SD was investigated, and the
data showed the best linear fit selected as the final release model.38 The data were fitted with different kinetic
models to determine the release mechanism. The results obtained are
the mean of three determinations. The f2 value was
estimated using eq 1 in
order to compare the resulting dissolution profiles: 1  where Rt and Tt are the percentages
of the drug dissolved at time t for the reference
and the test formulation, respectively.
Each time point was weighted equally, and the dissolution profiles
were considered as equal when the f2 was higher than
50. This means that the average difference between the two profiles
at all time points is 10%.

4.10 Antioxidant Activity
The in vitro
antioxidant activity of LT and LT-SDs (LT-FUD, LT-SED, and LT-MID)
was measured using DPPH assay with slight modifications.31 The colorless solution of the sample will be
converted into a violet color by the DPPH solution. The electron scavenging
capability of antioxidants leads to a change in color. The control
(LT) and LT-SD (LT-FUD, LT-SED, and LT-MID) were dissolved in DMSO
to get a fixed concentration (5.0 mg/mL). Separately, the stock solution
of DPPH was prepared in methanol (0.4 mg/mL). Then, the sample solution
(1 mL) was taken and transferred to the DPPH solution (2 mL). The
reaction mixture was mixed vigorously with shaking and incubated in
the dark at room temperature for 30 min. The absorbance of the resulting
solution was measured at 517 nm using a UV–vis spectrophotometer.
The blank sample was prepared with a similar procedure without LT,
and the antioxidant activity was determined using eq 2: 2  where AControl is the absorbance of the control, and ASample is the absorbance of the sample.

4.11 Statistical Analysis
Results are
expressed as mean ± standard deviation (SD) from three replicates
for each experiment, and the data were analyzed by using PCP Disso
V3 software (Bharati Vidyapeeth Deemed University, Pune, Maharashtra,
India). The analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey’s test were
used to compare the differences among various groups, and a value
of p < 0.05 was considered to be statistically
significant.
