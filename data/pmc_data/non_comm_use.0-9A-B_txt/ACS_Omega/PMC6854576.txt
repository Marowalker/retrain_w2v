Permeability plays a decisive role
in the dewatering process and
reflects the difficulty of filtration, especially for soft solid material
such as sludge. In this paper, the physicochemical properties and
dewatering performance of sludge conditioned with different kinds
of flocculants were investigated. Results showed that the flocculant
could change the sludge microstructure such as floc morphology, specific
surface area, and fractal dimension. Compared with filtration pressure,
flocculants had a greater influence on sludge permeability which was
a significant negative correlation with filtration pressure and was
a positive correlation with flocculant dosage. In order to describe
the fact that fluid flows through the porous voids for soft solid
sludge, the improved Kozeny constant was corrected. Research showed
that permeability was more significant in the dewatering process for
the sludge conditioned with inorganic flocculants than that with organic
flocculants. The Kozeny constant was not only relevant with suspension
nature but also with filtration pressure. The range of the improved
Kozeny constant was reasonably determined based on flocculant type,
concentration, and filtration pressure, which was of great help to
project applications. For raw sludge, the improved Kozeny constant
was 958 times than that of the original value, and it decreased significantly
for conditioned sludge.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Sludge is the product
of sewage treatment. In recent years, with
development of cities and industries, the output of sewage sludge
increased sharply, causing serious environment pollution.1,2 It is estimated that the production of sludge (moisture content
of about 80%) in China increased by 20 million tons from 2010 to 2017.
Sewage sludge is a kind of soft solid material with high water content
(up to 99%), high organic content, fine particles, and small specific
gravity. Extracellular polymeric substance in sludge passes through
hydrophilic functional groups, such as −COOH and −OH,
to provide a strong cohesive force, making inorganic particles and
microbial cells organically linked and attached to the surface of
microbial cells. As a result, a gel-like bio-colloid structure similar
to the sodium alginate was formed.3−5 These sludge characteristics
determine that sludge is difficult to be dewatered and cannot even
dewater without pretreatment.6,7 Sludge dewatering is
an essential process in sludge disposal, which has close relation
with the final processing cost.

In order to improve sludge dewaterability,
many methods are employed,
including chemical, physical, biological, and hybrid conditioning.8−11 Chemical conditioning aims to change sludge physicochemical or electrochemistry
properties by adding acids, coagulants/flocculants, and it is a relatively
mature, cost-effective, and user-friendly sludge dewatering technology.12−21 Physical conditioning mainly refers to thermal hydrolysis, ultrasonic
conditioning, freeze–thaw treatment, and biological conditioning
adopts enzymes and bioflocculants.22−27 In many pretreatments, coagulants/flocculants are the most common
agents for sludge conditioning in practice because of lower cost and
higher efficiency.8,9,16,28 Cationic polyacrylamide (CPAM) with a linear
high molecular weight is a typical organic flocculant and has a variety
of active groups (such as −CONH2). Physical and
chemical acting force (main including hydrogen bonding forces and
van der Waals forces) facilitates adsorbing and bridging between sludge
particles and CPAM, which could contribute to forming strong flocculation
and good dewaterability at low dosage.13,17,20 Polyaluminum chloride (PAC) and ferric chloride (FC)
are inorganic flocculants and could hydrolyze into hydroxyl compound
in aqueous solution. Because of bridging of hydroxyl ions and polymerization
of polyvalent anions, the molecular weight of PAC is larger than FC.
However, PAC and FC could both facilitate conglomeration of sludge
particles into flocs through charge neutralization and enmeshment.
Besides, inorganic flocculants have been reported to be served as
skeleton builders and improve the porosity of the sludge cake.8,10,18,29,30

Fluid flowing in porous media (including
filter media and filter
cake) is the filtration essence. As the filtration process proceeds,
solid particles in suspension continuously deposit on the surface
of medium to form a filter cake or block inside pores of medium. Then,
flow resistance increases, and filtration rate decreases rapidly.31,32 Permeability is a key parameter for studying the filtration process,
and it is the most basic problem in studying seepage of porous cake
materials.33 However, the permeability
in both the Ruth equation and Kozeny–Carmen (K–C) equation
is treated as a constant. At the same time, particles in the K–C
equation are treated as uniform, hard spheres, and the contact form
between particles is point. Furthermore, the Kozeny constant (Kc) is usually fixed in a constant of 5, in fact,
which is related to material properties and has larger fluctuation.
Many researche studies have been done and several empirical models
have been constructed to study the permeability of deformable porous
media, including index models, power models, and logarithmic models,34−36 while most of them focus on rocks and are not applicable to soft
solid gel materials such as sludge. Therefore, an appropriate permeability
model in sludge filtration should be studied.

In this paper,
in order to accurately describe the mechanism of
filtration dehydration for soft solid gel materials, CPAM, FC, and
PAC were selected as sludge conditioners to obtain different kinds
of suspension with various physicochemical characteristics. On the
basis of Darcy’s law, the Kozeny constant in the K–C
equation was improved and established.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Effect of Flocculant on
Sludge Physicochemical
Properties
Figure 1 shows the effect of the flocculant on the floc size, pH,
one-fractal dimension, and specific surface area. It can be seen that
as the addition amount of inorganic flocculant PAC and FC increased
to 120–140 mg/g, the pH of sludge suspension decreased from
6.88 of original sludge to 6.09 and 5.54, respectively. Hydrolysis
of PAC and FC could cause higher concentration of the hydrogen ion
in the solution, and thus, the pH of the solution decreased.8,29 Furthermore, stronger hydrolysis performance of FC led to lower
pH than that of PAC. However, CPAM could inhibit sludge dissolution,
hydrolysis, and acid production. As a result, when the amount of CPAM
was 3 mg/g, the pH increased from 6.88 to 7.50. The variation trend
of the sludge particle size and specific surface area with the dosage
of PAC and FC was not a monotone decrease, and the minimum (maximum)
occurred at 40 and 60 mg/g for PAC and FC, respectively. While for
all sludge samples conditioned with PAC and FC, the smaller particle
size and larger specific surface area were observed, compared with
original ones (original sludge particle size: 71.89 μm, specific
surface area: 946.7 cm2/g). It is possibly due to their
high charge density, which could effectively compress the double electricity
layer. In addition, the CPAM dosage was negatively correlated with
the specific surface area and positively correlated with the particle
size, which was on account of the effect of electrical neutralization
on particle agglomeration and flocculation. One-fractal dimension
characterizes the regularity of the aggregate structure, and it is
negatively correlated with flocculant dosage for all the treatments,
which is consistent with the results of Zhao.37 It is possible that more compact and more peripheral regular flocs
are formed under charge neutralization between electronegative particles
and cations within flocculants, leading to a smaller one-fractal dimension.
As a result, improved porosity of the filter cake and better dewaterability
were obtained.38,48

on sludge characteristics.

2.2 Effect of the Flocculant and Filtration Pressure
on Filter Cake Permeability
2.2.1 Effect of the Flocculant
on Filter Cake
Permeability
Figure 2 shows the effect of dosage of three kinds of flocculants
(PAC, FC, and CPAM) on permeability at a constant pressure gradient
of 3.4 × 105 Pa, respectively. With the increase of
flocculant dosage, permeability increased first and then decreased.
As the dosage of PAC was at 100 mg/g, it increased by 50 times compared
to that of original sludge (from 5.89 × 10–11 cm2 for original sludge to 2.88 × 10–9 cm2). In the filtration process, the charge neutralization
effect could reduce the thickness of the hydrated shell of sludge
particles and enhance free water content by compressing the electric
double layer and weakening the surface tension of sludge water, leading
to better dewaterability.39 Meanwhile,
excessive dosage might cause sludge particles to be covered with PAC,
resulting in the regeneration of the suspension stability, that is,
the “restabilization effect”. Therefore, the optimal
dosage of PAC was 100 mg/g in this work, which was consistent with
the previous work.14 However, as the sludge
treated with organic flocculant CPAM (at the dosage of 3 mg/g), the
permeability was only 3.86 × 10–10 cm2, which increased by less than 7 times, indicating that filtration
velocity is faster for sludge treated with an inorganic flocculant
at this condition.

Figure 2 Permeability at different flocculant concentrations.

2.2.2 Effect of Pressure on
Filter Cake Permeability
Figure 3 illustrates
the effect of filtration pressure on sludge filter cake permeability,
where the sludge was treated with three kinds of flocculants (PAC,
FC, and CPAM) at the concentration of 100, 120, 3 mg/g, respectively.
It can be seen that with the increase of filtration pressure, the
filter cake permeability first dropped sharply and then tended to
be gentle, which may be due to the decreased effective gap in the
filter cake at higher filtration pressure. As filtration pressure
was greater than 3.4 × 105 Pa, its influence on permeability
became inapparent, maybe due to the formation of a highly compact
skin at the interface between the cake and filter medium. In addition,
the permeability for the sludge conditioned with CPAM reduced by 91.7%
as filtration pressure increased from 1 × 105 to 3.4
× 105 Pa, which was obviously above those of sludge
treated with PAC and FC, maybe attributing to the higher compressibility
of sludge conditioned with CPAM.

Figure 3 Permeability at different filtration pressures.

Figure 4 demonstrated
the relationship between the filtration rate and filtration pressure.
Obviously, a weak correlation was observed. In theory, higher filtration
pressure could contribute to the outflow of the filtrate, but concurrently,
the partial effective pores of the filter cake are gradually blocked,
resulting in the reduction of effective porosity. Consequently, the
filtration rate could not be proportional to pressure. Also, at the
filtration pressure of 3.4 × 105 Pa, the filtration
rate of original sludge was 0.0086 cm3/s, while it increased
by 44.2, 30.2, and 5.6 times for sludge conditioned by PAC, FC, and
CPAM, respectively. Inorganic flocculants (PAC and FC) can destroy
the sludge network structure and weaken its water-trapping capability.
As a result, flocs became more peripheral, regular, and compact with
a smaller specific surface area, smaller settlement drag coefficient,
and the effective porosity in the filter cake became larger, leading
to better dewaterability performance. Furthermore, the improvement
of the filtration rate for CPAM-conditioned sludge is not significant
compared with inorganic flocculants PAC and FC, maybe due to its limited
dosage.

Figure 4 Filtration rate at different filtration pressures.

2.3 Establishment of K–C for Sludge
Common expression for the permeability is expressed as a product
of a preset constant. The best-known formula is perhaps the K–C
relation, which is shown as eq 1. 1  where ε refers to local porosity, %; S0 refers to specific surface area of particles,
m2/m3; Kc refers
to Kozeny constant, which is related to suspension nature, including
shape and compressibility of particles, dimensionless. For grain-like
particles, Kc is usually defined as 5,49 and it can be deduced and calculated by eq 1 in this paper.

Permeability
prediction is an important aspect of the filtration process design.
The K–C equation (Formula 1) belongs to a class of relationships relating the pressure
gradient and flow rate of fluid flowing through porous media, and
it is applicable to randomly packed media composed of spherical or
nearly spherical particles. However, the filtration process of sludge
with soft solid gel properties and complex physicochemical properties
is difficult to be described by K–C, where the Kozeny constant
is determined as about 5.

In order to account for the fact that
fluid flows through the voids
of a porous media for soft solid sludge, the improved Kozeny constant
is proposed, which reflects the effect of sludge properties on dewatering
and represents dewatering performance. Consequently, Formula 1 was corrected by (Formula 2). 2  where Kc′ is the improved Kozeny
constant, suggesting that the medium morphology should be taken into
account. In order to clearly explain the effect of three kinds of
flocculants on dewatering performance, the ratio of the improved Kozeny
constant to the original one (Kc) was
introduced (Kc′/Kc). The
bigger value of Kc′/Kc suggested
higher dewatering resistance.

2.3.1 Effect of the Flocculant
on the Kozeny Constant
Figure 5 exhibits
the values of the improved Kozeny constant (Kc′) for raw
and conditioned sludge at the filtration pressure of 3.4 × 105 Pa. Obviously, for the original sludge, Kc′ was
about 958 times contrasting to that given in literature studies (Kc was about 5).40,50 While for
conditioned sludge, the value decreased prominently, from 4787 to
several hundreds. Actually, the Kozeny constant has great relation
to flocs, reflecting the physical nature of sludge. Original sludge
contains various interlaced and disordered substances. On the contrary,
conditioned sludge with more regular floc particles was a more regular
arrangement, resulting in significant reduction of the Kozeny constant.

Figure 5 Value
of Kc′ at various dosages of (a) PAC and FC;
(b) CPAM.

Interestingly, with the increase
of dosage, the value of Kc′ reduced. As the PAC dosage achieved
100 mg/g, the minimum value
of Kc′ (36) was observed, suggesting that the optimum dosage
was determined, which is consistent with the above discussion. Furthermore,
the minimum value of Kc′ was closed to Kc (the value was 5), indicating that the floc characteristics
for sludge conditioned by PAC was compact and less compressible, which
can contribute to dewatering. While for the sludge conditioned with
CPAM, the value of Kc′ was larger, maybe due to larger floc
and higher compressibility.

2.3.2 Effect
of Filtration Pressure on the Kozeny
Constant
Figure 6 presents the relationship between filtration pressure and Kc′ at the follow condition (PAC: 100 mg/g, FC: 120 mg/g and CPAM: 3
mg/g). As above mentioned, the Kozeny constant is a material property,
which refers to floc morphology, particle size, and compressibility.
Therefore, the pressure gradient should not be taken into account
during filtration. However, it is unexpected that Kc′ was
obviously positive correlation with filtration pressure, which increased
significantly from 9.6 to 48 for the sludge conditioned with PAC (filtration
pressure: from 1.0 × 105 to 4.2 × 105 Pa). Perhaps, because of the particular characteristics for soft
solid sludge (high compressibility and soft particles), extremely
high variation in floc morphology and fractal structure appeared in
higher pressure, resulting in an increment of the Kozeny constant.
Therefore, for organic flocculant CPAM, Kc′ was larger
than those of inorganic.

Figure 6 Relationship between Kc′ and filtration
pressure.

2.4 Prediction
of the Improved Kozeny Constant
Sludge is a typical soft
solid material with difficult dewaterability
because of high content of the organic matter. The Kozeny constant
as a comprehensive parameter is relevant to a material characteristic
in the filtration process, reflecting dewatering performance indirectly.

As shown in Figure 5, Kc′ decreased first with increase of flocculant dosage
and then increased at one point. The minimum values of Kc′ were
about 36 and 162 for sludge conditioned with PAC and FC, respectively,
which decreased significantly compared to unconditioned sludge (Kc′ is 4787). The variety trend of Kc′/Kc with flocculant dosage at the filtration pressure of 3.4
× 105 Pa is shown in Figure 7, from which it can be seen that the ratio
was at the range of 7.2 to 457. As the dosage of flocculant was appropriate, Kc′ would not exceed 50 and 160 for PAC and FC, respectively. Compared
to Kc, the improved Kozeny constant increased
by 7.2 times to 36.8 times for conditioned sludge with PAC and increased
by 32.4 times to 125.6 times, for conditioned sludge with FC, respectively.
While for CPAM conditioned sludge, the maximum value of Kc′ is
around 2000, and it could not be less than 590 usually.

Figure 7 Value of Kc′/Kc at various
dosages for (a) PAC and FC; (b) CPAM.

Figure 8 presents
the relationship between filtration pressure and Kc′/Kc. For an inorganic flocculant, the ratio value
was small, and especially for PAC, the minimum was only 1.9 at the
pressure gradient of 1.0 × 105 Pa, which was close
proximity to the original Kozeny constant. Interestingly, at lower
pressure, it could be concluded that physical characteristics of the
sludge conditioned by PAC was similar with less compressible materials,
maybe due to its skeleton effect. While, for sludge conditioned with
CPAM, it could be inferred that the minimum value of the Kozeny constant
is about 100, and the maximum value should not exceed 600 as the added
dosage of CPAM is reasonable (at the range of filtration pressure
of 1.0 × 105 to 4.2 × 105 Pa). Obviously,
the Kozeny constant for organic flocculant-conditioned sludge is in
a larger range than that of inorganic conditioned sludge. The main
reasons may be the significantly changed viscosity and strong cohesive
force for organic conditioned sludge, which deforms sludge floc particles
and in turn affects the range of the Kozeny constant.

Figure 8 Relationship between Kc′/Kc at different filtration pressure.

Although the Kozeny constant is influenced by many
factors, it
fundamentally reflects the nature of suspension. Based on the above
discussion, it can be concluded that the parameter of the filtration
rate has a strong correlation with the Kozeny constant, which provides
a more reliable basis for inference of the Kozeny constant. No matter
what kind of flocculant is added and how much pressure is applied,
the goal is to improve dewatering performance of sludge, and the filtration
rate just reflects it. Figure 9 shows the relationship between the Kozeny constant and filtration
rate for three kinds of flocculants with different dosage at filtration
pressure of 3.4 × 105 Pa. Interestingly, linear correlation
with a high correlation coefficient was observed between the Kozeny
constant and filtration rate. Also, the fitted formula could be only
appropriate as the dosage of the flocculant was under the optimum
value. However, as the addition was excess, it could be not applicable,
because of irregular changes in physicochemical properties of sludge.

with (a) PAC; (b) FC; (c) CPAM.

3 Conclusions
The sludge was conditioned by
organic and inorganic flocculants,
and the Kozeny constant in the permeability model for soft solid gel
materials (such as sludge) was corrected and established. The specific
conclusions were as follows.(1) Flocculants could change physicochemical
properties of sewage sludge. The organic flocculant makes the floc
particle size larger, the specific surface area smaller, and the fractal
dimension smaller. While with the increase of the inorganic flocculant
dosage, the fractal dimension decreased gradually. Furthermore, in
the particle size and specific surface area, an inflection point was
observed at the dosage of 40 and 60 mg/g for PAC and FC, respectively.
The particle size decreased first and then increased. Correspondingly,
the specific surface area increased first and then decreased.

(2) Compared with filtration
pressure,
the flocculant has a greater influence on sludge filtration. In addition,
permeability has a significantly negative correlation with filtration
pressure and a positive correlation with flocculant dosage.

(3) Kozeny constant in the
permeability
model for soft solid materials was established, which is not only
relevant with suspension nature but also with filtration pressure.
The range of the improved Kozeny constant was reasonably determined
based on the flocculant type, concentration, and filtration pressure,
which was of great help to project applications. For raw sludge, the
Kozeny constant was 958 times than that of the original value. PAC
and FC-conditioned sludge, the Kozeny constant decreased significantly,
which was at the range of dozens to hundreds, while for CPAM-conditioned
sludge, the Kozeny constant ranged from hundreds to thousands. The
improved Kozeny constant was more significant in the dewatering process
for the sludge conditioned with inorganic flocculants than that of
organic flocculants, maybe due to differences of the action mechanism,
and it could provide a certain experimental basis for filtration of
soft solid materials.



4 Materials
and Methods
4.1 Sludge Samples
The municipal sludge
was taken from efflux of the secondary sedimentation tank in the Beijiao
sewage treatment plant (Taiyuan, Shanxi province, China), and then
was stored in a refrigerator at 4 °C to reduce properties change
and ensure accuracy of following experiments. The sludge physicochemical
properties were shown in Table 1. Before each experiment, the sludge was concentrated to a
solid content of 7% and placed indoors for 30 min, which ensured that
each set of experiments was carried out at room temperature. Furthermore,
each experiment was performed 3 times, and the average value was taken
for accuracy and repeatability.

4.2 Sludge Filtration Test
A batch filtration
instrument was employed to complete the filtration experiment of sludge,
which is mainly composed of a pressure filter with the cross-sectional
area of 60.132 cm2, an air compressor, and a gas storage
tank.

The sludge was conditioned with different dosage of CPAM,
FC, and PAC to improve physicochemical and dewatering properties,
and the conditioning steps were as follows. First, a certain amount
of the flocculant was added into sludge to prepare sludge suspensions.
Second, the prepared sludge suspensions were stirred with a mechanical
stirrer at 200 rpm for 5 min to accelerate mixing of the flocculant
and sludge, and then stirred at 50 rpm for 15 min to promote sludge
flocs growth, in order to obtain uniform sludge suspensions. Finally,
batch filtration of conditioned sludge suspensions was carried out
in the batch filtration instrument. The control variable method was
used to investigate the effects of independent variables (including
flocculant dosage and filtration pressure) on physicochemical properties
and permeability during filtration. On the basis of previous studies,
dosages of CPAM, FC, and PAC were determined as 0–3, 0–140,
and 0–120 mg/g, respectively (relative to dry solid mass in
sludge).14,41−43 The particle size and
specific surface area of the sludge suspensions were measured by a
laser particle size distribution analyzer (Bettersize 2000, China).
Optical microscopy (Olympus, Japan) was used to observe and photograph
sludge microscopic morphology was used to calculate sludge one-dimensional
fractal dimension.44−49 Average cake porosity was obtained by the free water content in
the filter cake.

4.3 Permeability Equation
For slow flows,
fluid velocity through porous media is proportional to the pressure
gradient, which obeys Darcy’s law as shown in eq 3. 3  where Δp refers to
pressure drop, Pa; L refers to dielectric layer thickness,
cm, which is defined as the thickness of the filter cake in this work
and can be obtained from experiment data; μ refers to liquid
dynamic viscosity, Pa·s; dV refers to liquid
volume flowing through the dielectric layer during time dt, cm3; A refers to cross-sectional area
of the filter cake, cm2 (60.132 cm2); and K refers to permeability of the filter cake, cm2, assumed constant. According to eq 3, K could be deduced.
