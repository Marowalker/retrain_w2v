Cu@Cu2O core–shell nanoparticles (NPs) not only possess a stabilized
structure but also exhibit better photocatalytic performance as compared
to pure Cu2O. Therefore, preparation of Cu@Cu2O core–shell NPs is key toward efficient photocatalysis applications.
In this paper, the fabrication of Cu@Cu2O core–shell
NPs on single-crystal MgO(100) substrates has been studied systematically
by pulse laser deposition. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images
show that the average diameter of NPs is enlarged from 89.9 to 150.3
nm with the increasing of oxygen pressure. Transmission electron microscopy
(TEM) images indicate that the NPs have elongated hexagons and a core–shell
structure with a shell thickness of about 10 nm. UV–vis absorption
spectra show that the position of the localized surface plasmon resonance
(LSPR) peaks shifts from 648 to 858 nm and the full width at half-maximum
(fwhm) of the LSPR peaks broadens from 226.7 to 436.5 nm with increasing
average diameter of NPs. According to the analysis, the red shift
of the LSPR peaks is caused by enlargement of the core diameter; higher
fwhm is a result of broadened particle size distribution and the elongated
morphology of NPs. Therefore, the width and range of LSPR peaks of
the absorption spectrum can be tuned using this method, which is beneficial
for enhancing the light absorption and improving the photocatalytic
efficiency of Cu@Cu2O core–shell NPs.

Introduction
Cu@Cu2O
core–shell nanoparticles (NPs) are a type of photocatalysts
that possess a stable structure and high surface to volume ratios,1 which are essential for photocatalytic applications.2−4 Up to now, many methods have been proposed to fabricate Cu@Cu2O core–shell NPs, including microwave irradiation,
electrochemical methods, solid-state reactions, chemical reduction,
and so on.3,5−11 Usually, wet chemical methods are used for preparing Cu@Cu2O core–shell NPs, which suffered from two drawbacks. First,
the agglomeration tends to occur in the photocatalytic reaction,12,13 which reduces the effective specific surface area and leads to the
decrease of photocatalytic efficiency. Second, the particle size of
Cu@Cu2O core–shell NPs is unitary,14−16 exhibiting a localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) peak with
relatively narrow width, which reduces the utilization of solar energy.
This work attempts to address these difficulties using two approaches.
First, the preparation method for NP films17 allows the NPs to be uniformly dispersed on the substrate, thereby
effectively preventing agglomeration. Second, preparing NPs with broad
full width at half-maximum (fwhm) and particle size distribution3,12,18,19 can increase the absorption range to the visible light, which can
increase the utilization of solar energy.

The pulse laser deposition
(PLD) method is utilized to overcome the drawbacks of wet chemical
methods. It is well known that PLD is an elementary and convenient
method for the fabrication of metal NPs. Metal NPs prepared by the
PLD method are mostly polygonal,18 which
can effectively enhance the LSPR effect,20 allowing the NPs to exhibit a broad light absorption range in the
spectrum. Meanwhile, compared with chemical methods,6,7,16 the fabrication process via the
PLD method can not only avoid the generation of complex intermediates
but also minimize impurities. Therefore, it is feasible to prepare
core–shell NPs films which achieve the two requirements above
by the PLD method.21 Meanwhile, this approach
is rarely studied. Hence, the effort to prepare core–shell
NPs films by the PLD method will be a valuable model and novel method
for the fabrication of homogenous core–shell NPs.

In
this work, Cu@ Cu2O core–shell NPs films are fabricated
by the PLD method. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and scanning
electron microscopy (SEM) measurements are used to characterize the
microstructure and morphology of all the prepared samples. In situ
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Auger electron spectroscopy
(AES) measurements are used to investigate the chemical state of all
the samples; combined with theoretical calculation and UV–vis
absorption spectra, the LSPR properties of all the samples from the
visible to the near-infrared light region are discussed.

Results and Discussion
In situ XPS measurements were carried out in order to investigate
the chemical states of the Cu element in all the samples, as shown
in Figure 1.

Figure 1 In situ XPS
measurements of all these five samples: (a) XPS survey spectra; (b)
Cu 2p core-level XPS spectra; (c) XAES spectra of Cu L3VV; (d,e) AES spectra of sample 1#; (f,g) AES spectra of sample 3#;
(h) Cu L3VV XAES spectra of sample 3#; (i) variation of
Cu+ content in each sample as a function of oxygen pressure.

Figure 1a presents the survey scan of the entire binding energy from
−20 to 1100 eV, which focuses on the existence of Cu and O.
As shown in Figure 1b, the Cu 2p spectra exhibit doublets (resulted from the spin–orbit
splitting) with the binding energy at 932.5 and 952.4 eV corresponding
to the Cu 2p3/2 and Cu 2p1/2, respectively.
Meanwhile, the weak peaks (marked by black rhombus) located at the
lower binding energy side of the main peaks are the satellite lines22 of 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 levels,
which were excited by the Mg Kα X-ray radiation. Notably, the
absence of sharp characteristic shake-up satellites of Cu2+, which are generally observed at a binding energy of about 9 eV
higher than the main peaks, indicates the existence of Cu+ or Cu0 (Cu metal). The absence of a weak hump23 (marked by the hollow rhombus) at around 965
eV also suggests that Cu in the samples should be Cu0,
which is further corroborated by the X-ray excited Auger electron
spectroscopy (XAES) spectrum of Cu L3VV. Comparing with XPS spectra of the Cu 2p core level, the XAES
spectrum of Cu L3VV can be used to distinguish between
Cu metal and Cu2O. The major Cu L3VV Auger peak
(marked by the red arrow) with the kinetic energy of 918.8 eV is shown
in Figure 1c. It has
been reported that the Cu0 Auger spectrum has a distinct
satellite feature22−24 at a kinetic energy of about 2.5 eV higher than that
of Cu+ (marked by the black arrow), which is located at
916.4 eV. Therefore, the appearance of the weak peak lower than the
major peak implies the existence of Cu+ in sample 2#–5#. Figure 1d–g are AES
spectrums of samples 1# and 3#, respectively. These results further
support the conclusion that only Cu0 is present in sample
1#, whereas both Cu0 and Cu+ are found in sample
3#. Figure 1h,i presents
the molar composition of Cu+ in each sample, which is determined
using the area under the peaks of the elements in the spectra using
the following equation25 1  where I represents the intensity of the atomic peak and S is the atomic sensitivity factor. From eq 1, the content of Cu+ in each sample
increases with the increase of oxygen pressure. However, the formation
of the Cu@Cu2O core–shell structure needs to be
further probed by TEM measurements.

To investigate the microstructure
of the fabricated NPs, TEM images of sample 1# and sample 3# are shown
in Figure 2, providing
direct evidence of the core and the shell (TEM images with detailed
information are presented in Figures S2 and S3). Figure 2a–d
is TEM images of sample 1#. A crystalized Cu NP is evident in Figure 2b. Figure 2c,d is the inverse fast Fourier
transform (IFFT) and fast Fourier transform (FFT) images obtained
from high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image of region I in Figure 2b. The lattice constant of
Cu(111) face are measured to be 2.09 Å. Although the total size
distribution of NPs is widely spread and the shape of the NPs are
mostly elongated hexagonally, as shown in Figure 2g, the thickness of the Cu2O shell
is consistently about 10 nm [measured in TEM images of other samples
as well (Figure S1)]. Figure 2h is the HRTEM image of a single
NP which provided the detailed structural information of the Cu core,
Cu2O shell, and the interface between the core and the
shell. Figure 2i,j
is the IFFT and FFT images obtained from the HRTEM image of the Cu
core in Figure 2h. Figure 2k,l is the IFFT and
FFT images obtained from the HRTEM image of the Cu2O shell
in Figure 2h. Both
Cu and Cu2O have the face-centered cubic crystalline structure;
the lattice constants of the (111) face are measured to be 2.07 and
2.42 Å, respectively. Figure 2e,f is the selected area electron diffraction (SAED)
images of samples 1# and 3#; only the diffraction information of Cu
can be distinguished in Figure 2e; meanwhile, both the diffraction information of Cu and Cu2O can be found in Figure 2f. It can be concluded that the Cu@Cu2O
core–shell NP films have been fabricated by the PLD method
successfully.

Figure 2 TEM images of the fabricated NPs: (a–d) TEM images
of sample 1#; (e,f) are the SAED image of samples 1# and 3#, respectively;
(g–l) TEM images of sample 3#.

In order to further investigate the morphology of NPs, SEM measurements
of a series of samples were carried out. Figure 3a–e shows the SEM images of samples
1# to 5#, and the respective Gaussian fits of their particle size
distribution histograms are shown in Figure 3f–j. The average particle diameters
of samples 1#, 2#, 3#, 4#, 5# were determined to be 89.9, 103.1, 118.1,
135.4, 150.3 nm, respectively. The fwhm of Gaussian peaks were determined
to be 84.6, 81.8, 85.0, 97.2, 120.7 nm. Therefore, it can be pointed
out that the average particle diameters of NPs increases with the
increase of oxygen pressure. The mechanism of the formation of Cu@Cu2O core–shell NPs can be described as follows. After
annealing for 1 h, the surface of the MgO(100) substrate facilitated
the nucleation of Cu atoms and clusters. Atoms’ and clusters’
aggregation enhanced to form NPs. The interior temperature of the
NPs was higher than the exterior temperature, which facilitated the
migration of oxygen atoms from the interior to the exterior.26 This primarily resulted in the oxidization of
the surface of NPs. When the formation of Cu@Cu2O core–shell
NPs was stabilized, the Cu2O shell prevented the Cu core
from being further oxidized. The mean free path of oxygen molecules
can be calculated by using the formula λ = kBT/2πd2P, where λ is the mean free path, kB is the Boltzmann constant, T is the Kelvin temperature, d is the molecular effective
diameter, and P is the pressure of gas. It can be
estimated that the mean free path of oxygen molecules is about 10
to 103 m, which is far greater than the distance between
the target and the substrate. Therefore, the main effect of oxygen
molecules is adsorbed to the surface of the substrate, which contributes
to decrease the migration and diffusion of Cu atoms and clusters,
resulting in the formation of larger Cu@Cu2O core–shell
NPs.

Figure 3 (a–e) SEM images of all these five samples; (f–j) corresponding
particle size distribution histogram.

The optical properties of the Cu@Cu2O NPs were investigated
both experimentally and theoretically, as shown in Figure 4.

absorption coefficient spectra of samples 1–5#; (b) calculated
absorption coefficient spectra of NPs with different geometric parameters;
(c) calculated absorption coefficient spectra of two Cu@Cu2O core–shell NPs with different distances between each other;
(d) calculated absorption coefficient spectra by using the spectra
in (b); (e) experimentally measured and calculated LSPR wavelength
as a function of the overall diameter of NPs; (f) UV–vis subpeaks
fitting the figure of sample 2#; (g) UV–vis subpeaks fitting
the figure of sample 4#; (h) UV–vis subpeaks fitting figure
of sample 5#.

In Figure 4a, the spectral features from 300 to 550
nm of sample 2# to sample 5# are attributed to the interband transitions
in Cu2O and the scattering from the Cu2O shell.27 The absorption feature above 550 nm is attributed
to LSPR for all samples.28 Sample 1# (magenta
curve) exhibits an LSPR peak located at 648 nm, which is from bare
Cu NPs.15 The position of the LSPR peaks
for sample 2#, 3# 4#, 5# are 701, 717, 772, 858 nm, respectively.
Interestingly, a weak hump is obtained at 912 nm, which remains unmoved
with the increase of the Cu core diameter. This peak can be attributed
to the interaction between nearby NPs.29−31 As the position and
area of this weak peak (the fit peak 1 in Figure 4f–h) do not change, it suggests that
the distance between NPs in each sample was nearly unchanged [measured
in SEM images of all the samples as well (Figure S5)].

A commercial finite-difference time-domain package32,33 is used to simulate the absorption coefficient spectra of the Cu@Cu2O core–shell NPs with different geometric parameters.
As the particle size distribution of the NPs was broad, only the geometric
parameters of NPs close to the determined average particle diameter
are used for the simulation of absorption coefficient spectra. Spherical
shape is adopted for the simulation of NPs. Dielectric constants for
MgO, Cu, and Cu2O are adapted from Palik’s experimental
data. In Figure 4b,
for each calculated absorption coefficient spectrum, the model of
two NPs with the same geometric parameter set on MgO substrates is
established, and the distance between the two NPs is adjusted to 10
nm. The corresponding geometric parameters of the NPs used in the
calculation of Figure 4b are summarized in Table 1. Figure 4c
is the calculated absorption coefficient spectra of two Cu@Cu2O core–shell NPs with the same geometric parameter
but different distances between each other. With the distance of two
Cu@Cu2O core–shell NPs decreasing, the interaction
between the two NPs increased, which resulted in the 850 nm peak becoming
stronger. This supports the previous deduction that NPs in each sample
maintain the same distance from each other. As shown in Figure 4e, the LSPR peak positions
of the calculated absorption coefficient spectra are in good agreement
with the experimental spectra, except for some minor deviations. However,
the peaks in Figure 4b are more narrow and symmetric than those in Figure 4a.

Table 1 Geometric Parameter

Cu core diameter (nm)	80	80	100	120	140	
According to the electric dipole
approximation and Mie theory, the absorption coefficient α34 can be obtained by 2  where εd is the refractive index of the matrix.
λ is the wavelength of the incident radiation. ε1 and ε2 are the real and the imaginary parts of
the permittivity of the metal particles, respectively, and P is the volume fraction occupied by the metal particles. Equation 2 shows the absorption
peak attributed to the LSPR effect of the free electron in metal particles
when ε1 + 2εd = 0, and the absorption
coefficient reaches a maximum. When nd is a constant over the measured range of the absorption spectrum,
the position of the absorption peak is mainly dependent on ε1, and the fwhm of the absorption peak is mainly dependent
on ε2. According to the Drude–Lorentz–Sommerfeld
free electron model, the permittivity35 of the metal particles can be described as 3  where Γ is the relaxation constant.
The relationship between Γ and the mean free path of the electron
(l) is Γ = vF/l, where vF is the Fermi velocity.
ωp = (nee2/ε0me)1/2 is the Drude plasmon resonance frequency, where ne and me are the
density and mass of electron, respectively. In case the the value
of ω is far greater than Γ35 4   5  

According to the resonance
condition ε1 + 2εd = 0, the resonance
absorption frequency is given as 6  

It can be concluded
from eqs 2 and 6 that the frequency and peak intensity of the surface
plasmon resonance absorption peak of the metal NPs are determined
by the electron density of the surface.36 Electrons on the surface of the spherical NPs are evenly distributed,
resulting in a single absorption peak that is sharp and symmetric.
The establishment of eqs 2 and 6 are based on the prerequisite that the
metal NPs are spherical. However, in our work, the shape of the NPs
is elongated hexagonal because of the effect of the crystal substrate
surface.37 It is known from electrodynamics
that electrons are more concentrated at the angle of polygonal metal
NPs, and thus the density distribution of electrons exhibits strong
anisotropy. In elongated hexagonal NPs, two peaks are related to two
types of nonequivalent angles that can be distinguished from the spectra,
which lead to the asymmetrical shape of the peaks in Figure 4a. The results of fitted peaks
(fit peak 2 and fit peak 3) are presented in Figure 4f–h (Figure S4). The surface plasmon resonance frequency is related to the surface
electron density.38 The surface electron
density is related to the surface area and the number of electrons.
Obviously, the surface area of NPs is increased with increasing the
average diameter of the NPs, leading to a decrease in the surface
electron density.39 This gives rise to
a decrease in the resonance frequency, resulting in the red shift
of LSPR peak. Actually, there exists a little deviation between experimental
value and theoretical calculated value in Figure 4e. In fact, there exists a diameter of NPs’
distribution for each sample, and each diameter size corresponds to
a definite absorption peak. Thus, the experimentally measured UV–vis
absorption coefficient spectra are broader than the theoretical calculated
spectra. Meanwhile, it is noteworthy that the facet effect has great
impact on the LSPR band position of Cu@Cu2O core–shell
NPs.40,41 As it reported in the literature, the {100}
facets remain most red-shifted than others.41 In our experiment, most of the crystal faces of the Cu2O shells are {100}, which contributes to the occurrence of the red
shift. According to Figure 4d, the green curve named with the sum is the weighted average
result of three calculated extinction spectra from different core
diameters. Obviously, the peak in the green curve is broader than
that in the other curves. The position of the peak in the green curve
is located at 746 nm, which is within the value of the three other
curves. From the above analysis, the red shift of LSPR peaks in Figure 4a is owing to the
enlargement of the core diameter, and the broadening of the LSPR peaks
is a result of the broadened particle size distribution and the elongated
hexagonal shape of the NPs.

Conclusions
In summary, a valuable
model and novel method, the PLD method, was employed to fabricate
core–shell NPs. Cu@Cu2O core–shell NPs were
successfully fabricated on MgO(100) substrates. By precisely raising
the oxygen pressure, a series of Cu@Cu2O core–shell
NPs with enlarged core diameter and broadened particle size distribution
were fabricated and well dispersed on MgO substrates. The increase
of oxygen pressure promotes the formation of enlarged Cu@Cu2O core–shell NPs, which exhibit a red shift and a broadened
LSPR peak in the UV–vis absorption spectra. Combined with the
calculated results, the red shift of the LSPR peaks is a result of
enlargement of the core diameter, and the broadening of LSPR peaks
is due to the broadened particle size distribution and the elongated
hexagonal shape of the NPs. Therefore, the width and the range of
LSPR peaks in the absorption spectrum can be tuned using this method.
This is beneficial for enhancing the light absorption and improving
the photocatalytic efficiency of Cu@Cu2O core–shell
NPs.

Experimental Methods
Experimental parameters are summarized
in Table 2. To achieve
the fabrication of Cu@Cu2O core–shell NPs, a copper
target was chosen for the ablation process. Prior to the deposition
process, the deposition chamber was evacuated down to the background
vacuum, and the laser frequency and laser energy density were adjusted.
The substrates were then annealed at working vacuum in order to obtain
a clean and uniform surface. Meanwhile, high-purity oxygen was prepared
for the deposition process.

in situ XPS with an unmonochromatized Mg Kα source (1253.6 eV)
and AES were used to investigate the chemical composition and state
of NPs. During XPS and AES measurements, the pressure of the ultrahigh
vacuum chamber was maintained at about 5 × 10–8 Pa. Then, the morphology and microstructure of those NPs were characterized
by SEM and TEM. Finally, optical absorption spectra were captured
in air by a double-beam UV–visible spectrophotometer with a
wavelength resolution of 2 nm (UV-360, Shimadzu).
