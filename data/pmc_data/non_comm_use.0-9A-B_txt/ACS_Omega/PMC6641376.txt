Graphene-enhanced polymer matrix
nanocomposites are attracting ever increasing attention in the electromagnetic
(EM) interference (EMI) shielding field because of their improved
electrical property. Normally, the graphene is introduced into the
matrix by chemical functionalization strategy. Unfortunately, the
electrical conductivity of the nanocomposite is weak because the graphene
nanosheets are not interconnected. As a result, the electromagnetic
interference shielding effectiveness of the nanocomposite is not as
excellent as expected. Interconnected graphene network shows very
good electrical conduction property, thus demonstrates excellent electromagnetic
interference shielding effectiveness. However, its brittleness greatly
limits its real application. Here, we propose to directly infiltrate
flexible poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) into interconnected reduced
graphene network and form nanocomposite. The nanocomposite is superflexible,
light weight, enhanced mechanical and improved electrical conductive.
The nanocomposite is so superflexible that it could be tied as spring-like
sucker. Only 1.07 wt % graphene significantly increases the tensile
strengths by 64% as compared to neat PDMS. When the graphene weight
percent is 3.07 wt %, the nanocomposite has the more excellent electrical
conductivity up to 103 S/m, thus more outstanding EMI shielding effectiveness
of around 54 dB in the X-band are achieved, which means that 99.999%
EM has been shielded by this nanocomposite. Bluetooth communication
testing with and without our nanocomposite confirms that our flexible
nanocomposite has very excellent shielding effect. This flexible nanocomposite
is very promising in the application of wearable devices, as electromagnetic
interference shielding shelter.

Introduction
The graphene-enhanced polymer matrix nanocomposites have attracted
ever increasing attention because of their robust mechanical, electrical,
and thermal properties.1−5 The improved
electrical conduction property of nanocomposites is potentially applied
in electromagnetic (EM) interference (EMI) shielding field.6−9 Normally,
the graphene is not easy to be directly introduced into the polymer
matrix because the graphene has very poor wettability with the matrix,
thus the graphene tends to be aggregated. Therefore, the functionalization
strategy is widely adopted to uniformly distribute the graphene or
graphene oxide (GO) into polymer matrix. However, the electrical conductivity
of these nanocomposites is normally weak either because the graphene
oxide is not easy to be in situ reduced or because it is not easy
to form three-dimensional (3D) conductive network when the graphene
loading is small.1−7,10−15 For example, Ling et al. reported that the graphene-based
EMI shielding poly(ether imide) (PEI) composite exhibited an EMI shielding
effectiveness (SE) of 20 dB with loading of 10 wt %.12 To further increase the EMI effectiveness, higher graphene
loading of 30 wt % is added (an improved 29 dB EMI SE of polystyrene
(PS)/graphene composite).16 Unfortunately,
high graphene loading results in brittleness problem of nanocomposites.
To address this bottleneck, it is expected that three-dimensional
conducting network could be constructed even though a small amount
of graphene is introduced. Recently, graphene or reduced graphene-based
three-dimensional architecture or network or aerogel has been widely
explored.1−10 The reduced
graphene aerogel (GA) demonstrates very good electrical conduction
because of electrical conducting network. However, the reduced graphene
aerogel shows obvious brittleness (quite different from that of carbon
nanotube (CNT) sponge3) because the van
der Waals interaction (very weak) exists among graphene nanosheets.
The brittleness of graphene aerogels greatly limits their real application
in electromagnetic interference shielding field, which requires the
excellent flexibility sometimes. So far, the brittleness of graphene
aerogel has not been addressed very well.17,18 Here,
we propose a novel strategy to fabricate flexible nanocomposite with
excellent electrical property. This novel strategy includes two steps.
In the first step, we construct a three-dimensional graphene network.
In the second step, the flexible poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) matrix
is directly infiltrated into graphene network using vacuum technique.
The nanocomposite shows an excellent electrical conductivity and a
high-performance EMI SE. Our thermal reduced graphene aerogel (TRGA)/PDMS
nanocomposites can be used as a flexible EMI shielding material for
portable equipment and wearable devices, potentially.

Results and Discussion
The overall fabrication
procedure of the TRGA/PDMS nanocomposite is shown schematically in Figure 1a. The graphene oxide
aerogel (GOA) was prepared by the freeze-drying method at first. A
following chemical reduction was carried out to convert GOA to graphene
aerogel (GA) with the hydrazine hydrate vapor.18 The GA shows inelastic property after several cyclic compressions
(Figure S1, Supporting Information). Subsequently,
the TRGAs were thermally annealed at 1000 °C for 3 h. Finally,
the PDMS was infiltrated into GA in a vacuum chamber. During infiltration
process, the GA thickness could be adjusted by applying vertical force
so that the reduced graphene oxide (rGO) percentage in nanocomposite
could be tuned. As a result, the nanocomposites include two concentrations
(1.07 and 3.07 wt %) of reduced graphene oxide.

Figure 1 (a) Schematic illustration of the fabrication
process of TRGA/PDMS composites; (b) optical photograph of the TRGA
and the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of TRGA at different
magnifications; (c) optical photograph of the TRGA/PDMS nanocomposites
and the SEM images of the TRGA/PDMS nanocomposites at different magnifications.

The microstructures
of TRGA and TRGA/matrix are observed by using scanning electron microscopy
(SEM). Figure 1b shows
a 3D architecture with abundant interconnected pores, thus PDMS can
infiltrate into the TRGA. In this way, we obtained a PDMS nanocomposite,
as shown in Figure 1c, the graphene network is embedded with PDMS matrix. The resulting
nanocomposite maintains the same shape and size as TRGA network (Figure 1c), indicating that
the TRGA network has not been interrupted during the infiltration
process, which provides the electrical conduction channels in nanocomposites.

To investigate the chemical state and crystal structure, spectroscopic
analyses were adopted using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS),
X-ray diffraction (XRD), and Raman spectroscopy. The deoxygenation
of graphene was proved by the detailed characterization of X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS). Figure 2a,b illustrates that the C 1s scan spectra of GO is composed
of four carbon components with different binding energies by fitting.
The four carbon components include C–C/C=C (284.8 eV),
O–C–O (286.2 eV), C=O (287.7 eV), and COO (289.2
eV).19,20 It is clear that GO contains a large amount
of oxygenated functional groups. From the spectra of GA, we can conclude
that the oxygenated functional groups have been removed almost, which
is evident of the disappearance of the peak at 289.2 eV (COO) and
the obvious decrease of the peak at 287.7 eV (C=O).20 Furthermore, the peak of C=O (287.7 eV)
disappears in TRGA spectra, which reveals that the oxygen-containing
functional groups on GA have been removed completely after the thermal
annealing process.

Figure 2 (a, b)
XPS analyses of
the as-prepared GO, GA, and TRGA; (c) X-ray diffraction patterns of
GO, GA, and TRGA; (d) Raman spectra of GO, GA, and TRGA.

The crystal structure of layered graphene
can be determined by analyzing XRD patterns. As shown in Figure 2c, the XRD spectrum
of GO has a peak at 11.1°, corresponding to an interlayer spacing
of GO of 8.6 Å.7,21 After chemical reduction and
thermal annealing of TRGA, a new peak (indexing to 002) at 26.5°
appears, indicating an interlayer spacing of 3.3 Å,21 which is smaller than GO. It is concluded that
almost all oxygen-containing functional groups disappeared from the
interlayer space of graphene, generating a well-ordered lamellar structure.
Finally, there is a sharp and narrow peak at 43–45°, as
shown in the XRD pattern of TRGA. Li et al.22 reported that the (100)/(101) peak intensity is the evidence of
more ordered stacking between layers (less rotation or translation).
Therefore, the XRD shows that a less defective graphene aerogel emerges
after heat treatment, and almost perfect graphene with single- or
few-layer sheets is obtained by our method.

Raman spectroscopy
was used to detect the defects, sp2 bond, and the number
of graphene layers. As shown in Figure 2d, the D-band peaking at 1360 cm–1 is the characteristic of disorders and defects in graphene and G-band
peaking at 1600 cm–1 (originating from in-plane
vibration of sp2 carbon atoms) is the characteristic of
the number of sp2 carbon domains. The intensity ratio between
them (ID/IG) can be used to confirm the number of defects in a graphene sample.
Compared to GO, the G-band of GA shifted from 1610 to 1604 cm–1, and its ID/IG intensity ratio is increased from 0.89 to 1.03, indicating
that more numerous but smaller sp2 carbon domains have
partially recovered during the reduction.20,23,24 In contrast, the ID/IG ratio decreased from 1.03
(GA) to 1.00 (TRGA), suggesting the repairing of defects created by
the attachment of oxygen groups and the preceding reduction.25 These results reveal that the defects of graphene
were repaired by the thermal annealing process. As well known, the
well graphitization is beneficial to improve the electrical property
and the EMI shielding property.

To assess the mechanical properties,
the TRGA/PDMS nanocomposites were cut into thin slabs, and neat PDMS
thin slabs (made by the same curing condition with TRGA/PDMS nanocomposites)
were also tested as reference samples. As seen in Figure 3a, the nanocomposite and neat
PDMS show different tensile stress–strain (σ–ε)
curves. The nanocomposite shows obvious mechanical enhancement. The
tensile strength of pure PDMS is about 1.07 MPa, and the TRGA/PDMS
composite increased to 1.75 MPa with loading 1.07 wt %. It is worth
noting from Figure 3b that the TRGA/PDMS nanocomposites exhibit a tensile modulus of
11.73 MPa, 12 times of that of the neat PDMS (0.97 MPa). The significant
improvement of mechanical strength can be attributed to two main factors:
the uniform dispersion of the graphene nanofiller and the effective
load transfer between the graphene nanofiller and PDMS matrix. Figure 3c,d shows the SEM
images of the fractured surface of TRGA/PDMS composites after testing,
which exhibit a uniform distribution of many short graphene segments
extruding from the PDMS matrix. These graphene segments could prevent
the crack from propagating through the PDMS matrix, thus consume more
energy during fracture. At the same time, the tensile strain of nanocomposite
is still very large, up to 25%, although it is decreased compared
to neat PDMS. The large strain indicates that the nanocomposite is
still flexible, which could also be reflected by optical images (Figure 3e). The nanocomposite
could be twisted or tied as spring-like sucker, which double confirm
that the nanocomposite is still flexible. Such excellent flexibility
is very useful in wearable devices.

tensile strength, Young’s modulus; (c, d) SEM images of the
fractured surface of the TRGA/PDMS nanocomposite; (e) a set of digital
images shows high level deformations of bend and torsion.

The electrical conductivity
of GA, TRGA, and nanocomposites is evaluated by current–voltage
(I–V) curve. Although the I–V characteristic of GA (before
reducing and thermal annealing) displays typical linear ohmic behavior
(Figure S2a, Supporting Information), the
value of GA is only 0.11 S/m, which is not suitable to be used as
EMI material (Figure S3, Supporting Information).
This is because the GA contains a large amount of chemical groups
and defects. By contrast, the electrical conductivity of TRGA is up
to 10.66 S/m (Figure S2b, Supporting Information),
100 times that of GA. This is attributed to the removal of functional
groups and defects recovery of graphene oxide, which is in good agreement
with XPS and Raman results. However, the pure TRGA is so brittle that
it is easy to break, which is not beneficial to wearable devices protection.
When the PDMS is infiltrated into TRGA network and forms the nanocomposite,
the electrical conductivity (Figure 4a) basically remains unchanged, in comparison with
the same concentration of TRGA. This implies that the electrical conductive
network was not destroyed during infiltrating process. The electrical
conductivity increases as the TRGA density increases. That is to say,
the electrical conductivity goes up when the reduced graphene concentration
increases. As shown in Figure 4a,b, with 1.07 wt % of TRGA, the electrical conductivity of
TRGA/PDMS nanocomposites is 9.2 S/m. As the TRGA loading increases
to 1.73 and 1.95 wt %, the electrical conductivity of the nanocomposites
increases to 39.96 and 65.6 S/m, respectively. Further increasing
the content of TRGA to 3.07 wt % leads the rise of electrical conductivity
to 103 S/m. Obviously, this phenomenon confirms that the conjunctions
between the graphene sheets increased, the more pathways for electron
transport are provided.26 The electrical
conductivity of nanocomposites versus graphene concentration from
references is compared with our result, as shown in Figure 4c. It indicates that our nanocomposite
shows obviously advantageous electrical conductivity under the same
graphene concentration.

conductivity versus TRGA content for TRGA/PDMS nanocomposites and
the corresponding TRGA electrical conductivity; (b) current–voltage
(I–V) curves of TRGA/PDMS
nanocomposites with different TRGA contents; (c) the electrical conductivity
of nanocomposites in reference and our work.

As well known, the graphene nanosheets
in polymer can change the dielectric properties of composite,27,28 thus the EMI shielding property of nanocomposites could be tuned
by changing the graphene content. We measured the EMI SE of pure PDMS
and nanocomposites in the microwave frequency range of 8–12
GHz (X-band). The pure PDMS without graphene is transparent to electromagnetic
waves and exhibits almost no shielding ability.29Figure 5a shows the EMI SE of TRGA/PDMS nanocomposites at the different TRGA
weight contents when the sample thickness is 2 mm. The EMI SE curve
basically does not fluctuate along with the measured frequency range
and the average EMI SE value is regarded as the EMI shielding effect
usually. Even though the TRGA content is only 1.07 wt %, the average
EMI SE value of composite can still reach to 30 dB, which implies
that this nanocomposite is a very good candidate for EMI application.
When the graphene loading is 3 wt %, the EMI shielding performance
reaches 54 dB. Figure 5b shows the EMI SE of TRGA/PDMS nanocomposites at the different TRGA
weight contents when the sample thickness is 0.8 mm. When the graphene
loading is 3 wt %, the EMI shielding performance reaches 33 dB. Such
excellent EMI performance is attributed to Table 1, which summarizes electrical conductivity
and EMI shielding performance of the graphene or carbon nanotube-filled
nanocomposites. It is obvious that at the same thickness (around 2
mm) of nanocomposite, our nanocomposite containing 3 wt % graphene
only shows more advantageous EMI shielding performance in comparison
with reported nanocomposites (the graphene content is up to 30 wt
%).

When the incident EM wave arrives on the surface of material,
the incident power (Pi) is divided into the reflected power
(Pr), the absorbed power (Pa), and the transmitted power (Pt), corresponding to the reflectivity coefficients (R), transmissivity coefficients (T), and
absorption coefficients (A), and their relationship
can be expressed as30  The total EMI shielding effectiveness
(SEtotal) is the sum of absorption (SEa), reflection
(SEr), and multiple internal reflections (SEm), and the equation
expresses as follow      When SEtotal > 10 dB, SEm can be ignored.7 And the R and T coefficients can be expressed in terms of scattering parameters
(S11, S22, S21, and S12), which
are directly output from the vector network, expressed as follows    As known the value of R and T, absorption coefficients (A) can be calculated
by the former equation.

To analyze the EMI shielding mechanism
of the TRGA/PDMS nanocomposites. SEtotal, SEa, and SEr vary as the filler loading varies at 9 GHz in Figure 5c. As the filler
increases, both SEtotal and SEa improve significantly,
whereas SEr increases slowly. When the TRGA content is
1.95 wt %, SEtotal, SEa, and SEr are
43.6, 37.3, and 6.3 dB, respectively. It is noted that the SEa is much higher than the SEr in the TRGA/PDMS nanocomposites.
The results confirm that the TRGA/PDMS nanocomposites are the absorption-dominant
shielding materials3,11,29 (Figure S4, Supporting Information). Additionally,
the increased SEa can be attributed to the increased electrical
conductivity due to increasing graphene content. On the other hand,
the 3D interconnected network structure of graphene formed amounts
of multifaceted cells, and graphene can be regarded as the cell walls,
so the EM waves can be reflected many times in our composites. As
indicated in Figure 5d, the microscale cells in the matrix could attenuate the incident
EM waves by reflecting and scattering between the cell walls. The
nanocomposites have a large amount of interface resulted from the
interconnected graphene nanosheet network, and the interfacial polarization
could consume the EM waves.31,32 The EM waves were difficult
to escape from the sample before being absorbed and transferred to
heat.11,33 As a consequence, the SEr is
attributed to the reflected EM only occurring on the surface of our
nanocomposites. The interconnected graphene nanosheets have great
attribution to the improved electrical conduction, which is highly
related to electron hopping.33 According
to the formula of microcurrent network,34 electron hopping will form microcurrent networks, resulting in conduction
loss. The relaxation loss ascribed to the dipole polarization is another
loss mechanism. The dipole polarization arises from functional groups,
defects, and multiple interfaces on the 3D graphene/PDMS nanocomposites.35

We have conducted an experiment to measure
the shielding effectiveness of our nanocomposite. The illustration
is shown in Figure 6. The Bluetooth adapter is connected with the PC and then the radio
signal strength is measured by testing software (BlueSoleil). The
green bar in testing software represents the signal strength. The
Bluetooth headset is covered by polypropylene (PP) box and nanocomposite
during headset playing. When the Bluetooth headset is covered by PP
box, the signal on PC is very strong. This means that the communication
is excellent and there is no shielding. When the headset is covered
by our nanocomposite, the signal strength is very weak due to shielding
effect. This means that our nanocomposite has very excellent shielding
property.

Conclusions
We have
fabricated a flexible, excellent electrical conductivity, and high-performance
EMI shielding PDMS nanocomposites by impregnating PDMS into a highly
porous graphene aerogel. The 3D network structure still remains after
PDMS infiltration. The nanocomposite is so superflexible that it could
be tied as spring-like sucker. Only 1.07 wt % graphene significantly
increases the tensile strengths by 64% as compared to neat PDMS. When
the graphene weight percent is 3.07 wt %, the nanocomposite has the
more excellent electrical conductivity up to 103 S/m, thus more outstanding
EMI shielding effectiveness of around 54 dB in the X-band are achieved.
Our flexible nanocomposite shows very excellent shielding effect from
the Bluetooth communication testing. This flexible nanocomposite is
very promising in the application of wearable devices, as electromagnetic
interference shielding shelter.

Experimental
Methods
Natural graphite powder (325 mesh) was provided by
Alfa-Aesar and poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) was supplied by Dow Corning
Co., Ltd. (China). KMnO4, H2SO4 (98%),
H3PO4 (85%), H2O2 (30%),
and HCl were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. (China).
All these reagents were used without purification.

Preparation of Graphene Oxide (GO)
Graphene oxide used
in this work was synthesized according to the procedure reported elsewhere
and described as follows. The concentrated H2SO4/H3PO4 (360:40 mL) was added to a mixture of
graphite flakes (3 g) and KMnO4 (18 g), and then the reaction
was heated to 50 °C for 11 h. After that, the mixture was cooled
to room temperature and poured into ice bath. Then, further treated
with 30% H2O2 (4 mL). The suspension was filtrated.
And the remaining solid materials were first washed with 10% HCl and
then deionized water for three times, followed by centrifugation (8000
rpm for 1.5 h). The washing procedure was repeated several times.
Then the GO suspension was gained.

Preparation of Thermal Annealing Graphene Aerogel (TRGA)
Graphene oxide aerogel (GOA) was fabricated directly by the freeze-drying
method. Typically, GO suspension (10 mg/mL) was continually stirred
for 2 h in a beaker and then poured into the desired mold followed
by freeze-drying for 72 h. The GOA was chemically reduced by hydrazine
vapor at 90 °C for 24 h, followed by vacuum-drying at 160 °C
for 24 h, then graphene aerogel (GA) was obtained. To tune the density,
the GAs with different thicknesses were pressed to the same thickness.
During press procedure, GAs were putted in a metal mold and pressed
several times to a desired thickness. Subsequently, GAs were subjected
to thermal annealing at 1000 °C in argon atmosphere for 3 h,
then thermal annealed GA (TRGA) was obtained.

Preparation of TRGA/PDMS Nanocomposites
The PDMS solution
was prepared by mixing PDMS base agent, curing agent in the ratio
of 10:1, followed by degassing in a vacuum oven for 25 min. The
TRGA/PDMS nanocomposites were fabricated by infiltrating the TRGA
with PDMS under vacuum with repeated vacuum pumping for 10 times at
time intervals of 20 min. Finally, the nanocomposites were thermally
cured at 80 °C for 3 h.

Characterization
The morphologies and structures of the GA and TRGA/PDMS composites
were characterized by field-emission scanning electron microscopy
(Carl Zeiss, Supra 55). The electrical conductivity was measured by
the two-probe method using an electrochemical workstation (PARSTAT4000).
The EMI shielding effectiveness was measured in the frequency range
of 8–12 GHz, using an Agilent N5234A vector network analyzer.
The composites were cut to fit the waveguide sample holder for EMI
SE measurement. The tensile properties were tested at a crosshead
speed of 0.5 mm/min, by Instron 5944. The geometries of sample used
for tensile testing were 0.5 cm thickness, 1.5 cm width, and 10 cm
length.
