Despite the growing need for readily
available and inexpensive
catalysts for the half-reactions involved in water splitting, water
oxidation and reduction electrocatalysts are still traditionally based
on noble metals. One long-standing challenge has been the development
of an oxygen evolution reaction catalyzed by easily available, structurally
simple, and purely organic compounds. Herein, we first generalize
the performance of the known N-ethyl-flavinium ion
to a number of derivatives. Furthermore, we demonstrate an unprecedented
application of different pyridinium and related salts as very simple,
inexpensive water oxidation organocatalysts consisting of earth-abundant
elements (C, H, O, and N) exclusively. The results establish the prospects
of heterocyclic aromatics for further design of new organic electrocatalysts
for this challenging oxidation reaction.

1 Introduction
In
the context of renewable energy transformation and storage,1 the production of hydrogen through water electrolysis
is of eminent importance. Although catalytic water reduction is already
well investigated,2 the water oxidation
step has drawn less attention, despite representing the kinetically
limiting half-reaction of the water splitting process.3,4 To date, water oxidation catalysis is performed the most efficiently
with molecular complexes and solids based on expensive transition
metals, in particular Ru,1−3,5 Ir,6 Co,7 or Os,8 whereas on the technical scale electrolyzers
mostly use Ni.

Recently, the N-ethyl-flavinium
ion (EtFl+, Figure 1) was reported by Glusac and
co-workers to function
as a first organocatalyst for the four-electron electrocatalytic water
oxidation.9 This seminal piece of work
represents an entry into an unexplored class of water oxidation catalysts
based on potentially inexpensive and easily available organic heterocycles.10,11 We envision that further developments within this class of compounds
might yield improvements in catalytic activity and synthetic availability
and perhaps thereby eventually provide an economical and environmentally
friendly alternative for the water oxidation reaction. However, another
cationic iminium derivative, N-methyl-9-phenyl-acridinium
(Acr+, Figure 1), was found inactive toward the oxidation
of water.12

Figure 1 Overview of the compounds
investigated.

In the mechanism proposed,9 the EtFl+ catalyst adsorbed on the glassy
carbon electrode surface is oxidized to a radical dication first,
followed by the formation of a pseudo-base upon hydroxylation of the
iminium carbon (position C4a) as the key step for oxygen evolution.
The contrasting reactivities of EtFl+ and Acr+ suggest that
a highly electrophilic iminium carbon (C4a in EtFl+) is crucial to the catalytic activity. In the
following, we assess to what extent the flavinium structure can be
modified or simplified without loss of reactivity. In this paper,
we will compare alternative catalysts and quantify their performance
as the shift in water oxidation onset ΔE0.5, defined as the difference between the potentials needed
to reach a current density of 0.5 mA cm–2 in the
absence and presence of a catalyst. In essence, ΔE0.5 represents the reduction of water oxidation overpotential
(and concomitantly, of activation energy) achieved by the catalysts.

2 Results and Discussion
For the reference compound EtFl+ClO4–,9a we measure an onset potential
shift of ΔE0.5 = 0.385 V when the
catalyst is added to the electrolytic mixture (Figure S1 in the Supporting Information). Another quantification
of the catalytic effect is provided by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy
(Figure S2), with a 3-fold reduction of
charge transfer resistance achieved by the catalyst at +1.94 V on
a glassy carbon surface. In energy terms, this corresponds to a reduction
of the activation free enthalpy by a modest 2.5 kJ mol–1. Appending peripheral functional groups to the EtFl+ backbone is tolerated. The carboxylic acid
derivative EtFlCH2ΦCOOH+ClO4– yields an overpotential reduction
value ΔE0.5 = 0.277 V (Figure S3).

On the basis of the accepted
mechanistic hypothesis of water attack
to the iminium carbon of EtFl+,9a one would expect that a neutral flavin, Fl, in which the imine nitrogen is not quaternized should
be electrocatalytically inert. Figure 2a shows that, unexpectedly, neutral Fl furnishes a species highly active for water oxidation as well: when
water is added to the electrolytic mixture, the oxidation currents
become significantly larger than their reductive counterparts. We
measure ΔE0.5 = 0.420 V, slightly
larger than with EtFl+, and observe
larger current densities as well. These results, however, are valid
only for the second and subsequent voltammetric cycles. If we start
with a fresh electrolytic solution of Fl (and water)
near the open-circuit potential and sweep in the anodic direction
(light blue curve of Figure 2b), no faradaic current (apart from the small pseudo-capacitive
current due to glassy C electrode) is observed at all up to 2.50 V.
After the initial voltammetric cycle, subsequent sweeps witness very
clear faradaic peaks, which initially increase with each cycle and
eventually stabilize. The reason for the appearance of two distinct
peaks instead of one could possibly be clarified by spectroelectrochemical
methods. If after such a set of voltammetric cycles, the electrolyte
is stirred, then left to stand for a few seconds, and measured again
in the same manner, the behavior shown on Figure 2b is reproducible. These observations contrast
those observed for EtFl+, where
the first and subsequent cycles are essentially identical to each
other.

Figure 2 (a) Cyclic voltammetry (100 mV s–1, second cycle)
of the neutral compound, Fl, on a glassy carbon electrode,
compared to that of the reference solutions. Light green, Fl only; dark green, Fl and 0.5 M H2O; dark
blue, 0.5 M H2O only; light blue, none (salt only). (b)
Evolution of the cyclic voltammetry of Fl. Starting from
the open-circuit potential in the anodic direction, the first cycle
is presented in light blue and subsequent ones are plotted in increasingly
dark shades of blue.

A plausible explanation for this behavior is furnished by
recollecting
the redox-based synthesis of EtFl+ from Fl.9a Indeed, alkylating
of the heterocyclic N atom is performed in three steps: reduction
by dithionite, electrophilic attack by an alkyl halide, and reoxidation.
Thus, under our voltammetric conditions, each cathodic sweep must
result in the formation of the intermediary compound, Fl•–, which is presumably protonated and subsequently
oxidized to HFl+. This metastable
species then features a reactivity much akin to that of the alkylated
compound. The comparison of cyclic voltammograms recorded with two
distinct switching potential values on the cathodic side is consistent
with this model (Figure S4). Finally, functionalized
derivatives of neutral flavins may also be active. FlCH2ΦCOOH yields ΔE0.5 = 0.284 V (Figure S5) at the second and subsequent voltammetric cycles.

Let us
now turn to simplified structures that still feature a highly
electron-deficient heterocycle. Pyridinium salts, among them N-methyl-3,5-dinitropyridinium (MePy+), have recently been reported by Cibulka and co-workers
to successfully catalyze the sulfoxidation reaction.13 This monooxidation, albeit a two-electron reaction only,
is relevant to water oxidation if the proposed mechanism is correct,
given the prominent intermediacy of an ortho-carbon-bound peroxide
species. Despite their facile access, pyridinium compounds have not
been investigated for water oxidation to date.

Figure 3a shows
the success of this simplified compound, which we prepared and investigated
as a triflate salt,13 and for which both
the molecular weight and the synthetic effort are diminished very
significantly. The shape of the voltammogram is qualitatively reminiscent
of the flavinium family of compounds, with a peaking behavior characteristic
of molecular, dissolved catalysts.14 A
quantitative comparison, however, reveals that MePy+ is significantly more proficient than EtFl+. The water oxidation onset is
further shifted to less positive potentials by approximately 0.2 V
(ΔE0.5 = 0.575 V). This corresponds
to a reduction of the activation free enthalpy on the order of 18
kJ mol–1.

Figure 3 (a) Cyclic voltammetry (100 mV s–1, second cycle)
of MePy+OTf– on glassy C, compared to that of the reference solutions.
Light green, MePy+OTf– only; dark green, MePy+OTf– and 0.5 M H2O; dark blue, 0.5 M H2O only; light blue, none
(salt only). (b) Cyclic voltammetry of MePy+OTf– in the presence
of increasing concentrations of water from 0.5 to 11 M.

The demonstration that water is indeed the substrate
being oxidized
electrocatalytically is provided in Figure 3b. Anodic current densities increase with
water concentration, linearly at first, and reach a plateau in highly
concentrated media (approximately 10 M). The anodic peak of interest
also shifts from about 1.68 V to near 1.46 V (vs Ag/AgCl) due to the
increasing polarity of the medium upon water addition, which stabilizes
charged species. At the highest water concentration, dihydrogen evolution
and reoxidation are also observable. Further, the product, O2, is directly measured by optical means (Figure 4) during bulk electrolysis at constant potentials.
We compare the reference compound, EtFl+ClO4–, at relatively high potential E = 1.94 V
versus Ag/AgCl (green dotted line) with our new MePy+OTf– at much
more moderate value E = 1.34 V (continuous blue line).
The gray curves represent the control measurements taken in the absence
of a catalyst. The extreme electrocatalytic proficiency of MePy+ toward water oxidation (as compared to
that of EtFl+) is materialized
by a similar O2 production rate obtained at 600 mV lesser
overpotential, whereas most water oxidation catalysts increase the
electrocatalytic current density by a factor 10 for every 60mV overpotential
increase (Tafel plot).

Figure 4 Dioxygen signals recorded during bulk electrolytic water
oxidation
under various conditions: continuous lines, 1.34 V versus Ag/AgCl;
dotted lines, 1.94 V; gray lines, no added catalyst; blue line, with
3 mM MePy+; green line, with
3 mM EtFl+.

Electrocatalytic current densities cannot be converted to
turnover
frequencies (TOFs) directly as in the case of homogeneous catalysis,
given that the amount of molecular catalyst at the electrode surface
is unknown. The Savéant diffusion model for “foot-of-the-wave”
analysis of the curve shape14 is not applicable
to our case due to the adsorption of the electrocatalyst demonstrated
by Glusac et al.9,12 To provide a value that can be
compared to the homogeneous catalysts nevertheless, we therefore calculate
a lower bound of the TOF on the basis of the assumption that the electrode
surface is covered with a compact monolayer of MePy+.9 For this, we will
use an area of the molecular cation of approximately 50 Å2 based on its molecular structure, a value that is consistent
with the integrated current of the cyclic voltammograms recorded in
the absence of water (≈1 C m–2). On the basis
of this value, the current density, J = 2 mA cm–2 (5 nmol O2 s–1 cm–2), obtained at the voltammetric peak of Figure 3b yields TOF ≥ 16 s–1 or TOF ≥ 56 000 h–1. Any possibly lower surface coverage would yield even larger TOF
values.

Further derivatives MePyz+ and MePym+ give rise
to an
electrocatalytic proficiency less pronounced than MePy+ and practically inexistent, respectively
(Figures S6 and S7). A rationale for this
behavior can be derived from 1H NMR spectroscopy. The chemical
shifts exhibited by the ortho hydrogens of these three cations follow
the same trend as the catalytic activities (Figure S8): MePy+ (9.92 ppm)
> MePyz+ (9.49 ppm) > MePym+ (9.28 ppm). Given that these
values furnish
a measure of the electrophilic character of heterocycles, the contrasting
reactivities of the three novel compounds provide strong credence
to the crucial mechanistic importance of a highly electrophilic ortho
carbon (C2). The combination of two nitro substituents ortho and para
to the crucial C2 at which nucleophilic attack by water occurs (see Figure S9 for a sketch of the hypothetical mechanism,
based on the published flavinium system) seems to be ideal.

3 Conclusions
The ethylflavinium salt (EtFl+), which was initially published as an exceptional
case of an organic
water oxidation electrocatalyst,9a now
belongs to a broader group of heterocyclic cations, some of which
are simplified, more easily accessible, and even more active (Figure 5). Catalytic proficiency
scales with the electrophilic character of the heterocycle. This property
does not require the complex flavin structure. The much simpler pyridinium
framework outperforms the reference compound, EtFl+, by a significant amount. The pyridinium compound, MePy+, is stable for weeks in solution
and under conditions of electrocatalytic turnover and outperforms EtFl+ by about 18 kJ mol–1 in activation energy reduction. These results open an avenue toward
more insightful mechanistic investigation of the water oxidation mechanism,
for example, by time-resolved and potential-dependent spectroelectrochemical
experiments and, thereby, toward further improvements in the performance
of organic electrocatalysis.

Figure 5 Summary of electrocatalytic water oxidation
proficiencies (quantified
as overpotential reduction) of the compounds investigated in the present
study. The originally published ethylflavinium salt is part of a broader
family of heterocyclic organocatalysts, some of which are structurally
simpler and catalytically even more proficient than it.
