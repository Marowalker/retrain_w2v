Highly
sensitive electrical detection of biomarkers for the early
stage screening of cancer is desired for future, ultrafast diagnostic
platforms. In the case of prostate cancer (PCa), the prostate-specific
antigen (PSA) is of prime interest and its detection in combination
with other PCa-relevant biomarkers in a multiplex approach is advised.
Toward this goal, we demonstrate the label-free, potentiometric detection
of PSA with silicon nanowire ion-sensitive field-effect transistor
(Si NW-ISFET) arrays. To realize the field-effect detection, we utilized
the DNA aptamer-receptors specific for PSA, which were covalently
and site-specifically immobilized on Si NW-ISFETs. The platform was
used for quantitative detection of PSA and the change in threshold
voltage of the Si NW-ISEFTs was correlated with the concentration
of PSA. Concentration-dependent measurements were done in a wide range
of 1 pg/mL to 1 μg/mL, which covers the clinical range of interest.
To confirm the PSA–DNA aptamer binding on the Si NW surfaces,
a sandwich-immunoassay based on chemiluminescence was implemented.
The electrical approach using the Si NW-ISFET platform shows a lower
limit of detection and a wide dynamic range of the assay. In future,
our platform should be utilized to detect multiple biomarkers in one
assay to obtain more reliable information about cancer-related diseases.

Introduction
Nanoscale field-effect
transistors (FETs) have emerged as versatile
and multiphasic technological tools for the realization of high-performance
sensor applications.1 Chemical sensing
or biosensing in solutions require the operation of the FETs in an
electrochemical-gate configuration. This is the classical ion-sensitive
field-effect transistor (ISFET) concept, where the FET response is
determined by changes in the surface potential at the solid–liquid
interface and by the composition of the electrical double layer (EDL),
which are both influenced by the binding of charged molecules.2,3 The usage of one-dimensional semiconductors such as silicon nanowires
(Si NWs) for ISFET platforms is advantageous because of their high
sensitivities toward surface-potential changes. Therefore, Si NW-ISFETs
are utilized for high-performance, “label-free” electrical
biosensors.4−6 In recent years, Si NW-ISFETs have been described
as an ideal candidate for different bioassays with an ever-increasing
focus on novel concepts dealing with label-free, continuous screening
of various biomolecules from complex biological media toward point-of-care
(PoC) applications.7−10

However, the use of nanoscale ISFETs for real applications
remains
challenging due to intrinsic limitations. Their electrical characteristics
are largely influenced by the composition of the EDL. Thereby, they
suffer from diminished performance for biodetection in physiological
solutions due to EDL contraction or Debye screening of the biomolecule
charges (typically <1 nm for physiological saline or biological
fluids).8,11,12 Strategies
to overcome this Debye screening for PoC biosensor applications in
blood serum have included physical manipulation of the solid–liquid
interface by polymer spacer layers, rendering of nanoscale features,
or alternating the working requirements.13−17 Alternative approaches to counteract Debye screening
rely on the use of nanoscale capacitors operated at high frequencies
and the impedimetric readout strategies with ISFETs.18−20 Here, microfluidics-integrated sensors have demonstrated great potential
toward label-free bioassays for screening of a variety of biomarkers
directly in physiological saline or human serum.10,21−24

Si NW-ISFET concepts are especially interesting for industrial
upscale due to the possible mass-production using state-of-the-art,
top-down nanofabrication methods (e.g., nanoimprint lithography (NIL)
or extreme ultraviolet lithography).25,26 In our previous
work, we described a NIL approach for wafer-scale, high-density fabrication
of Si NW-ISFET arrays with identical sensor characteristics.27 In this work, we deploy these Si NW-ISFETs as
label-free electrical biosensors to realize simple and direct potentiometric
screening of prostate-specific antigen (PSA), a 33 kDa single-chain
glycoprotein. A healthy man has a PSA level <4 ng/mL in serum,
whereas increased PSA concentrations may indicate a risk of prostate
cancer. Also, the increased rate of PSA level over time is a solid
diagnostic evidence and therefore multiple and swift tests over time
would enable better healthcare. For risk stratification, an increased
serum PSA level is usually complemented with biopsies followed by
tissue examination.28 These procedures
are sometimes unnecessary and can even cause over diagnosis of risks
in some patients.29−34 The direct screening and close monitoring of PSA together with newer
biomarkers such as glycoproteins and micro-RNAs may reduce the painful
tissue examination procedures in the future.

Unlike other sensor
platforms described in literature for the label-free
detection of PSA with PSA-specific antibodies as receptors, our Si
NW-ISFETs were functionalized with DNA aptamers specific to PSA.35−44 Specially designed aptamers mimicking the binding site conformations
of target analytes have a strong advantage over antibody receptors,
particularly for field-effect sensing due to their much smaller size.13,42,45−48 In this work, we show a high
specificity and a robust binding of PSA toward the aptamer functionalized
Si NW surfaces. The small sizes typically within a few nanometers
and the negatively charged DNA sequences of the aptamers render the
solid–liquid interface with a defined surface charge density.
Therefore, the use of aptamers as biofunctionalization layer is advantageous
for field-effect sensing of large biomolecules. This is demonstrated
in this work for screening of PSA with a dynamic concentration range
spanning over 5 orders of magnitude while fully covering the clinically
relevant concentration range.

Furthermore, we compare the response
of the aptamer-modified Si
NW-ISFETs with microscale Si ISFETs.49 The
nanoscale devices show a much better response for label-free electrical
biosensing. As a control assay, we detected the binding of PSA by
chemiluminescence on the chip surfaces, which also confirmed the highly-specific
binding to the aptamer receptors. The Si NW-ISFET aptasensor arrays
achieved a high performance for the label-free detection of PSA biomarkers
in a concentration range from 3 pM to 30 nM (10 pg/mL to 1 μg/mL).
Our optimized Si NW-ISFET aptasensor platform therefore offers a straightforward
field-effect detection of globular biomolecules. Enabled with a miniaturized
handheld readout, multiplexing approaches combining similar sensor
arrays for other candidate biomarkers on this sensor platform can
be promising in the near future for high-throughput clinical assays
towards PoC screening of cancer biomarkers in general.21,50−53

Results and Discussion
Top-down nanofabrication of enhancement-mode,
p-type Si NW-ISFETs
with an optimized lithography protocol was earlier developed in our
group and the realization of high-aspect-ratio Si NWs on 4 in. silicon-on-insulator
(SOI) wafers was demonstrated.27 It was
confirmed that the resulting arrays of Si NWs exhibited high-quality
SiO2 gate dielectrics after anisotropic wet etching and
dry oxidation, resulting in superior sensor characteristics with low
electrical hysteresis and identical sensors over wafer scale. The
usage of p-type devices has a chemical reason in particular when only
SiO2 is used as gate dielectrics. In case of n-type, the
cations from the electrolyte solution intercalate into the porous
oxide driven by the gate bias voltage causing break down of the dielectrics
and malfunctioning of the sensors. Better performance is reported
for other gate dielectrics like Al2O3 or HfO2, which we aim to integrate in a later stage of our project
as well. Fabrication details of the devices are summarized in the Materials and Methods section. A typical sensor
chip with Si NWs arrays is shown in Figure 1. Figure 1a shows a photograph of a sensor chip that was mounted
on a specially designed printed circuit board (PCB) to enable external
electrical contacts for the Si NW-ISFET source and drains. Figure 1b illustrates an
electrical circuit diagram for the operation of the Si NW-ISFETs.
As it can be seen from Figure 1b, the source is grounded, whereas a negative bias is applied
to the drain, resulting in a drain–source voltage Vds. An Ag–AgCl reference electrode is immersed
into the electrolyte solution and used to apply the front-gate voltage Vgs, whereas the drain–source current Ids is measured via an amplifier. In this configuration,
the back-gate contact was grounded and therefore fixed to the same
potential as the source contact. Figure 1c shows a three-dimensional representation
of an atomic force microscopy (AFM) scan of a typical set of Si NWs
connected to a common source and four individual drains. Each Si NW
with a trapezoidal cross section measured 14 μm in length, 67
nm in height, and 250 nm in width at the base. The Si NWs had a thermally
grown gate oxide layer (6–8 nm) for ISFET operation as well
as for providing hydroxyl groups for subsequent chemical surface modifications.

(PDMS) aligned over 8 sets of Si NWs on top of the 32-channel Si NW-ISFET
chip, also showing common source and individual drain contact lines
(f).

The schematic illustration in Figure 1d shows the covalently
functionalized aptamer
sequences (32 nucleotides) as a PSA-specific biofunctional layer on
a Si NW. More information on the aptamer sequence and the surface
functionalization protocols is provided in the Materials
and Methods section as well as in the Supporting Information
(Figure S1). Figure 1e,f shows the integration of a microfluidic
channel on top of the sensor chip realized in a poly(dimethylsiloxane)
(PDMS) layer. The microfluidic channel was aligned over the Si NW
sets, which can be seen in the microscopic image taken through the
PDMS layer (Figure 1f).

Aptamer-functionalized Si NW-ISFETs were then deployed
for the
electrical detection of PSA, and initial findings on the sensor performance
are summarized in Figure 2. Measurements were carried out in phosphate buffer (PB) at
pH 7.4 while applying a drain–source bias of −100 mV
and sweeping a gate voltage against an Ag/AgCl reference electrode
from −1 V to −100 mV. Transfer characteristics of a
typical Si NW-ISFET recorded with these parameters are shown in Figure 2a. The black curve
in Figure 2a represents
the transfer characteristics of a Si NW-ISFET modified with 3-glycidoxypropyltrimethoxysiloxane
(GPTMS) using a high-quality gas-phase silanization protocol.54 In the field of biosensor research also, other
abbreviations for this type of silane are used such as GPTES or GOPS.
Main advantage of using this silane instead of the more common (3-aminopropyl)triethoxysilane
is that cross-linking with additional molecules such as succinic anhydride
can be omitted.55 The direct link of amino-functionalized
capture molecules to the GPTMS layer is advantageous for the field-effect
detection resulting in a smaller distance of the analyte molecules
to the sensor surface after binding. A threshold voltage (Vth) shift toward positive gate voltages was
observed after surface functionalization with PSA-specific aptamers,
shown as the red curve in Figure 2a. Amino-modified aptamers were used as receptors.
They can covalently bind to the glycidol functional groups of GPTMS
while introducing additional negative charges to the solid–liquid
interface. Therefore, a decrease in Vth of the Si NWs upon binding of aptamers is observed.53,56 The successful functionalization of aptamers onto the Si NW surfaces
was also confirmed by AFM measurements, which are discussed in the
Supporting Information in Figure S2. The
average size of the PSA-specific aptamers with 32 nucleotides is about
10 nm in length and about 1.2–1.8 nm in thickness. In a 10
mM ionic strength PB, the Debye length is about 2 nm. With comparable
sizes of aptamers and EDL, we expect an efficient change in the EDL
composition upon binding of aptamers, which is evident from the strong
threshold shifts in the transfer characteristics.27 To avoid nonspecific binding of analyte PSA, a molecular
blocking layer of ethanolamine (EA) was used. This step was applied
to the whole chip surface and should block the nonfunctionalized surface
groups of the aptamer-modified regions as well as the nonmodified
surfaces next to the microspots when the microspotting procedure was
used in some experiments (for details, please refer to the Supporting
Information S3). The binding of EA to the
Si NW-ISFET surfaces induced a decrease in Vth of several 100 mV (Figure 2a). After this blocking step, the aptamer sensor platform
was ready for the detection of PSA.

Figure 2 Statistical evaluation of the sensing
behavior of the Si NW-ISFETs
for the detection of PSA: shift in Vth of a typical Si NW-ISFET after different surface immobilization
steps including GPTMS, aptamer, EA functionalization, and 30 nM PSA
binding (a), transfer characteristics of a Si NW-ISFET without aptamer
functionalization as a negative control (b), sensor responses of 27
out of 32 Si NWs from a single sensor chip with and without aptamer
functionalization. The recordings are shown in one graph as the change
in Vth values before and after binding
of 30 nM PSA (c). The large number of channels on one chip enables
us to statistically evaluate multiple experiments. The histogram shows
the average changes in Vth during surface
immobilization steps with and without aptamers. A statistical analysis
of these changes was done with a paired t-test (d).
The dot chart shows the change in average Vth of different Si NW sets (four Si NWs each) on one-sensor chip before
and after analyte binding (e). Average Vth change of these Si NW sets at each immobilization step is represented
as average value ± standard deviation. When evaluating all sensors,
the paired t-test shows significance for all steps
(*** = P < 0.001, ** = P <
0.01 and ns for nonsignificant) (f).

A PB solution containing 30 nM enzymatically active PSA from
human
seminal fluid was applied to the sensor platform and allowed to bind
to the sensor surfaces. The resulting transfer characteristic of a
typical Si NW-ISFET is shown in Figure 2a (blue curve). It is known from conformational studies
that DNA aptamers form adaptable secondary and tertiary structures
to bind with their target analytes.48 These
conformational binding mechanisms are responsible for a sometimes
even higher specificity and affinity of aptamer receptors compared
to their antibody counterparts.42 Some
portions of the negatively charged phosphate backbones of the aptamers
are shielded during this conformational adaptation upon binding with
PSA and therefore a reduction in total density of negative surface
charges on the solid–liquid interface is possible.43 It was also earlier reported that the isoelectric
point of PSA can vary in a wide range from pH 6.4 to 8 because of
the variable degree of its glycosylation.38,57,58

We assume that the Vth increase upon
binding of PSA to the DNA aptamers on the Si NW surfaces is caused
by a positive charge addition onto the surface. Therefore, for our
experiments, the PI of this particular PSA in its glycosylation state
should be higher than 7.4. The aptamer–PSA binding causes an
increase in Vth of the Si NW-ISFETs.

To confirm the specificity of the sensor signal, we applied the
same 30 nM PSA in PB solution to Si NW-ISFETs without aptamer functionalization
as controls. The response of a control sensor is shown in Figure 2b. As can be seen
from the blue and green curves of Figure 2a,b, respectively, the sensor response was
highly specific. However, individual responses were underlying statistical
variations. With the 32-channel Si NW-ISFET sensor chips (arranged
in 8 sets of 4 Si NWs each), we were able to statistically evaluate
the sensor platform. In Figure 2c, it is shown that the platform could also be utilized with
on-chip control channels. A typical experiment is shown, where 27
out of 32 channels were electrically functioning. Sensor positions
from 1 to 20 were functionalized with PSA-specific aptamers, whereas
21–32 were not functionalized with the aptamer. In this experiment,
the site-selective functionalization was realized with a DNA microspotter.
More information about the microspotting procedure for functionalization
of aptamers and the influence of the microspotting to the Si NW-ISFET
performance is provided in the Supporting Information (Figure S3). This experiment also details how
our platform could be utilized for the parallel detection of multiple
analytes. As can be seen from the graph in Figure 2c, changes in Vth values were consistent over all the sensor positions with some variations
in absolute values. The changes in the Vth values after PSA interaction were much higher for the sensor positions
functionalized with the aptamer. However, because the microspotting
protocol was a tedious procedure, for the statistical evaluation of
all experiments described in the following, only whole-chip surfaces
of Si NW-ISFETs were functionalized for better reproducibility of
sensor characteristics and higher throughput in the experiments. Figure 2d compares the average
shifts in the Vth value for the aptamer-functionalized
and nonfunctionalized sensors. The average Vth values of the control channels did not change (PB), whereas
the aptamer functionalization of the other channels caused a shift.
A paired t-test analysis of the sensor response confirmed
nonsignificant changes (ns) for controls in comparison to aptamer-functionalized
Si NWs (*** for P < 0.001). The blocking step
with EA also caused significant changes in the sensor channels and
controls, whereas the binding of 30 nM PSA induced statistically significant
changes in the sensing channels (*** for P < 0.001)
in comparison to ns for control channels. Therefore, in later experiments,
the relative PSA responses are always plotted with respect to the
EA transfer characteristics.

When evaluating the individual
sets of one Si NW-ISFET sensor chip
(four Si NWs per each set), the variation in five different sets is
shown in Figure 2e.
This experiment was done with aptamer-functionalized sensors and 30
nm PSA in PB was applied as an analyte solution. In four out of five
cases, the sensors show a significant response. The complete analysis
of the response of these five Si NW sets is shown in Figure 2f. Statistically significant
(*** for P < 0.001 and ** for P < 0.01) variations in Vth shifts
were observed at each surface modification step, as well as for the
sensor response towards 30 nM PSA. Therefore, we can conclude that
the Si NW-ISFET platform offers stable and reproducible responses,
and that it can be utilized for specific detection of PSA.

For
real diagnostic applications, a PSA test should be most precise
at a concentration level of around 4 ng/mL (0.12 nM), whereas depending
on the age group and ethnic background, levels lower than 0.1 ng/mL
(3 pM) can be measured in healthy men, but levels of 4 ng/mL and higher
suggest further diagnostics in terms of biopsy. Commercially available
diagnostic tests cover concentration ranges of 0–50 ng/mL (0–1.5
nM), with limits of detection (LOD) as low as around 0.05 ng/mL (1.5
pM).59 We defined this concentration range
as the “range of interest” for our Si NW-ISFET assays.
In this range, an optimum sensor for PSA detection should show highest
sensitivity (i.e., sensor signal/concentration), which is the slope
in the dose–response curve. At best, the relation between the
sensor signal and the given concentration is linear, which is very
rare for affinity-based sensor approaches. In general, it is important
that the calibration curve shows a very small statistical error with
good reproducibility between the data points to enable an optimum
resolution of the sensor in the range of interest. From related publications
in our European project PROSENSE, we know that the aptamers used in
this publication show a very good binding of analyte PSA with high
association constants.60,61

First, to optimize our
Si NW-ISFET sensor platform toward the electrical
detection of PSA with lower concentrations in the sample and to confirm
the specific binding of PSA to the receptors, we utilized two optical
assays with chemiluminescence and fluorescence detection, respectively.
The chemiluminescence sandwich immunoassay for the detection of PSA
is schematically depicted in Figure 3. Figure 3a,b shows a schematic illustration of this assay, where the Si NWs
are either functionalized with PSA-specific aptamers (Figure 3a) or nonspecific aptamers
(Figure 3b) of the
same sequence length (32 bases) as controls. These experiments were
done inside the PDMS microfluidic channels of 100 μm width,
which were mounted onto the Si NW-ISFET chip surfaces. By this procedure,
the channel can be compared with the PDMS-protected surface as the
background. The analyte PSA solution was flown through the microfluidic
channels and allowed to bind to the aptamer surfaces. After this,
PB solution with anti-PSA horseradish peroxidase (HRP) antibodies
was flown through the microfluidic channels and allowed to bind to
the immobilized PSA. The substrate luminol (5-amino-2,3-dihydrophthalazine-1,4-dione)
was excited by oxidation to form an intermediate state using H2O2. The luminol in the excited intermediate state
was then allowed to react with the anti-PSA HRP antibodies bound on
the Si NW surfaces. The reaction of luminol with the HRP enzyme returned
it to the ground state with an emission of a photon. This photon emission
then indirectly confirmed the presence of PSA on the Si NW surfaces.

Figure 3 Testing
the performance of the biofunctional layers on the Si NW-ISFET
surfaces using a chemiluminescence assay: schematic illustrations
showing the build-up of the biofunctional layers for the chemiluminescence
assay (a, b). Microscopic images showing the chemiluminescence intensities
for the detection of analyte PSA using the specific aptamer sequence.
Also, in the case of PB without PSA, the anti-PSA HRP antibodies bind
to the specific aptamers. Nevertheless, a chemiluminescence increase
with increasing PSA concentration can be seen (c). In the case of
the nonspecific PSA aptamer receptors also, the anti-PSA HRP antibodies
did not bind nonspecifically, showing no chemiluminescence signal
(d). The histogram displays the average chemiluminescence intensity
(arbitrary units) of all experiments with PSA-specific and nonspecific
aptamers. A paired t-test shows significance only
in the higher concentration level (ns for not significant, *** for P < 0.001, ** for P < 0.01 and *
for P < 0.1) (e).

In this chemiluminescence assay, the intensity of the optical
signal
is directly related to the amount of anti-PSA HRP antibodies bound
to PSA. It is therefore indirectly related to the concentration of
PSA in the analyte solution, when a nonspecific binding of the antibodies
to the surface can be excluded.62 Details
of the surface modification and other procedures used in the chemiluminescence
assay are provided in the Materials and Methods section. Figure 3c shows the microscopic images of the chemiluminescence generated
inside a microfluidic channel on the surface of a Si NW-ISFET chip
upon the interaction of luminol with anti-PSA HRP antibodies. In general,
this optical method is not sensitive enough for very low concentrations
of PSA. The PSA concentrations of 1.5 nM (50 ng/mL) and 3 nM (100
ng/mL) were tested, and significant increase in chemiluminescence
intensity can only be seen with a higher concentration of PSA (Figure 3c; bottom images).

To ascertain the specificity of the optical signals, two control
experiments were performed. First, the chemiluminescence intensity
for the interaction between anti-PSA HRP antibodies and PSA-specific
aptamers on the Si NW-ISFET surfaces was measured, such as shown in Figure 3c (top image), where
the PB did not contain PSA before flowing the anti-PSA HRP antibody
solution through the channel. It can be seen that the anti-PSA HRP
antibodies also binded unspecifically to the PSA-specific aptamers,
leading to a background signal. In contrast, the nonspecific aptamer
sequence did not bind the anti-PSA HRP antibodies (Figure 3d). This suggests a small cross-reactivity
between anti-PSA HRP antibodies and PSA-specific aptamers, which would
need to be avoided by a blocking step. For further optimization of
the assay, this blocking step is a crucial element that needs more
attention. However, other researchers in the field optimized such
DNA aptamer assays on glass slides,63,64 and we could
apply and adapt the same principles to our SiO2 sensors
surfaces. The statistical evaluation of all chemiluminescence experiments
that showed variation in chemiluminescence intensity as a function
of PSA concentration is presented in the histogram plot of Figure 3e. Significance was
confirmed for the interactions of the PSA-specific aptamers with PSA
in comparison to nonspecific interactions at lower concentrations
(ns for not significant, *** for P < 0.001, **
for P < 0.01, and * for P <
0.1).

These results confirm that the surface chemistry on the
Si NW-ISFET
surfaces is robust, and that the aptamer receptor layer specifically
captures PSA from the analyte solution. The second optical method
based on direct fluorescence detection with anti-PSA fluorescein isothiocynate
antibodies was less sensitive. Fluorescence assay results with 30
nM PSA in PB are provided in the Supporting Information S4.

After the confirmation of a PSA-specific
binding in the chemiluminescence
assays, the Si NW-ISFET sensor platform was evaluated for the electronic
detection of the ultralow concentrations of PSA. Concentrations of
0.3 pM, 3 pM, 30 pM, 300 pM, 3 nM, and 30 nM (1 pg/mL to 1 μg/mL)
were tested. This concentration range widely covers the clinically
relevant concentrations of PSA as prostate cancer biomarker in men.
The sensor responses of the Si NW-ISFETs are summarized in Figure 4. First, we tested
the stability of the platform by control measurements with PB solution
without PSA while comparing the threshold voltage changes (ΔVth) at all surface modification steps (Figure 4a). The sensors demonstrated
identical characteristics for all steps with low standard deviations
and statistically meaningful (paired t-test) shifts
in Vth (ns for nonsignificant, ** for P < 0.01 and * for P < 0.1). As shown
in Figure 4a, the responses
were nonsignificant for the interaction of PB buffer without PSA analyte
molecules. Therefore, we can exclude the eventual washout effects
of the biorecognition layer. It should also be noted that the standard
deviations increased from step-to-step during surface modification.
From this stepwise increase, we can conclude that with each surface
functionalization step, the Si NW-ISFET chip surfaces get less uniform,
resulting in higher variations in the signals from different locations
of the chip surface. For further optimization of the PSA assay, this
increasing nonuniformity should be optimized as well.

Figure 4 Label-free, fully electronic
detection of PSA with Si NW-ISFETs:
the histogram demonstrates how each chip was evaluated for the bioassay.
Small standard deviation should be noted for multiple Si NWs from
one chip. Here, a control experiment is evaluated, which shows the
stability of the sensor platform. The average change in ΔVth at each step of surface functionalization
is displayed. The paired t-test results in ** = P < 0.01, * = P < 0.1, ns = nonsignificant
(n = 2 independent experiments) (a); typical field-effect
response of one Si NW-ISFET functionalized with the PSA-specific aptamer
and tested with PSA concentrations varying from 0.3 pM to 30 nM (b);
typical field-effect response of a control Si NW-ISFET without aptamer
functionalization at the same PSA concentrations confirming the PSA-specific
sensor response (c). The scatter chart summarizes the absolute Vth shifts as a function of increasing PSA concentrations
for repeated experiments, where the results were baseline corrected
to the smallest concentration of 0.3 pM (n = 2) (d).
The errors bars differ because we evaluated several channels from
two independent chips for the PSA concentration tests and several
channels from one control chip. Data points represent average values
± standard deviations.

The performance of a Si NW-ISFET with different concentrations
of PSA is shown in Figure 4b. It can be seen that the transfer characteristics shifted
toward decreasing Vth values with increasing
PSA concentration. A control Si NW-ISFET modified without the PSA-specific
aptamers is shown in Figure 4c. As can be seen, the transfer characteristics did not show
any significant shift in Vth. Figure 4d summarizes the
dose–response curves of all the experiments with the Si NW-ISFET
platform, where relative threshold voltage changes (ΔVth—compared to the values after EA blocking)
are plotted on the y-axis against the PSA concentrations
(x-axis) from 0.3 pM to 30 nM. To compare different
Si NW-ISFET chips, the shifts were baseline corrected (ΔVth = 0 V) to the lowest PSA concentration tested.
A clear and significant increase in sensor signal is already visible
at a PSA concentration as low as 3 pM. Control signals remained stable
until a slight increase in the highest concentration of 30 nM, which
we attributed to unspecific binding of PSA to the control surfaces.
In Figure 4d, the range
of interest is indicated, and it can be seen that our highly sensitive
Si NW-ISFET platform already detected significant responses in a low
PSA concentration regime. It is to be noted that the values for the
detection channels display several sensors from two 32-channel Si
NW-ISFET chips, whereas the control displays channels from one control
chip (average ΔVth ± standard
deviation). Therefore, the error bars for the PSA detection are a
bit larger. Unfortunately, our sensor platform yet does not show the
necessary resolution in the critical concentration range of about
4 ng/mL (120 pM), which would be needed for critical diagnostic decisions
toward eventual biopsies. However, the sensor response is already
strong and statistically significant at much lower concentration levels,
which was also reported in related works using the same aptamer sequences.60,61 This would eventually also allow dilution and conditioning of clinical
samples with conditioning buffer before PSA tests, which is advantageous
to stabilize side parameters such as ionic strength and pH value of
the test solution. In addition, also for PSA concentrations beyond
this concentration level, a further signal increase can be seen (Figure 4d; concentrations
larger than 3 nM), which we attribute to unspecific binding to the
PSA-specific aptamer surfaces (consistent with also the signal increase
in the controls).

Similarly, ultrasensitive detection of PSA
with other silicon nanowire
platforms was earlier reported in literature. In Table 1, we compare the performance
of our top-down fabricated aptamer Si NW-ISFET platform with contemporary
studies for label-free detection of PSA with silicon nanowires. In
our assay, we cover a wide concentration range with an LOD clearly
below 50 pg/mL, which would be the necessary value for diagnostic
applications.

In general, the ultrasensitive
detection of biomolecules with Si
NW platforms originates from the high surface-to-volume ratio of the
Si NWs and precise surface charge properties attenuated with the use
of small receptor molecules such as aptamers.43,44,66 We also adapted our PSA bioassay protocol
to microscale ISFETs of silicon. The sensitivity toward the detection
of PSA was much lower in this case (see the Supporting Information, Figure S5).

In the future, the adaptation
of our Si NW-ISFET platform to a
specific diagnostic PSA test would be possible because the most sensitive
regime was clearly below the concentration regime of the highest interest
(4 ng/mL). The necessary sample dilution would even be advantageous
for diagnostic assays because this procedure could be utilized to
condition the analyte solution and control the main side parameters
such as the ionic strength and pH. By this procedure, the wide response
window of our platform could be adapted to the concentration range
of diagnostic interest.

Conclusions
A platform based on
top-down fabricated Si NW-ISFET arrays was
successfully deployed for the detection of PSA in the clinically relevant
concentration range from 0.3 pM to 30 nM. We utilized highly specific
aptamers to capture PSA from diluted phosphate buffer solutions. Such
aptamer receptor molecules have the advantage of being very small
compared to antibodies, which is beneficial for field-effect detection
on surfaces, where the distance of the analyte molecules to the surface
is crucial. Other clear advantages of aptamer receptors are the robustness
and storage time compared to many other approaches as described in
literature.63,64 The protocol for the biofunctionalization
of the sensors was carefully build up step-by-step and binding of
the molecules to the surfaces was confirmed by AFM. In addition, the
specific binding of PSA to the PSA-specific aptamer receptors was
confirmed by chemiluminescence and fluorescence detection, which we
performed inside the microfluidic channels mounted on top of the chip
surfaces. Compared to two optical methods, the field-effect detection
with Si NW-ISFETs method showed higher sensitivity with statistically
significant shifts in threshold voltages. This fully electronic detection
with our platform achieved a lower LOD as well. The fabrication protocol
of the sensor platform was established in a top-down wafer-scale process
resulting in Si NW-ISFETs with nearly identical sensor characteristics.
This enabled a reliable and reproducible sensor performance, where
we could utilize chip-to-chip controls. Using a microspotter, we also
demonstrated the possibility of an on-chip control, which will be
mandatory for the realization of future diagnostic assays. In addition,
the highly reproducible sensor sites of our Si NW-ISFET platform would
enable simultaneous detection of multiple analytes on one chip like
in typical glass microarray bioassays with fluorescence readout. We
demonstrated the experimental capability with a precise, site-selective
microspotting procedure, but we did not utilize this technique to
prime the different sensors of the Si NW-ISFET arrays with different
capture molecules. For future optimization, the highly minaturized
Si NW-ISFETs would eventually allow an integration into readout tools
for mobile use because the power consumption of field-effect detection
is in general and with highly miniaturized Si NW-ISFETs in particular
very low. In our assay, however, we yet did not reach the necessary
resolution in the most critical concentration range of ∼4 ng/mL,
which is typically associated with the onset of prostate cancer. Because
the LOD was much lower than this concentration level, a sample dilution
would be possible to condition the patients’ serum stabilizing
the pH value while reducing the ionic strength to boost the sensitivity
of the detection. So far, we only tested in saline solution with slightly
elevated salt concentration. For future developments toward clinical
applications, selectivity in complex media needs to be tested. One
major advantage of our platform is that in principle, it also allows
for parallel analysis of multiple biomarkers. For this then, the surface
functionalization and in particular the blocking step before the detection
need to be optimized.63,64 Our Si NW-ISFET platform therefore
provides a viable substitute for a high-throughput and multiplexed
analysis toward other bioassays as well.67 Equipped with high-density integration of sensor sites and parallel
readout options, such sensor platforms are in future expected to generate
actionable diagnostic information for PoC medical diagnostics.

Materials
and Methods
Materials
Amine-terminated, PSA-specific DNA aptamer
(5′-NH2-(CH2)6-TTTT TAAT TAAA
GCTC GCCA TCAA ATAG CTTT-3′), nonspecific aptamer (5′-H3N-(CH2)6-AAAAATTAATTTCGAGCGGTAGTTTATCGAAA-3′),
ethanolamine (EA), and GPTMS were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, Germany.
PSA was obtained from Merck Chemicals Ltd. (Beeston, U.K.). For the
electronic assays, PB with pH 7.4 and 10 mM concentration was prepared
from monohydrate phosphate and dinatrium hydrogen phosphate salts.
Anti-PSA antibodies [5A6]-HRP (catalog no. Ab2446) and anti-PSA-fluorescein
isothiocyanate antibodies (catalog no. Ab178776) were purchased from
Abcam, U.K. Luminol (SuperSignal West Femto Substrate Trial Kit 34094)
was purchased from Thermo Scientific, Portugal. All the other reagents
were of analytical grade. Metallic plug adapters for the microfluidic
channel and capillary tubing (BTPE-90) were purchased from Instech
Solomon (PA). One milliliter syringes were purchased from CODAN, Germany.
The liquid flow in the microfluidic channel for the optical immunoassays
was controlled using a NE-300 syringe pump from New Era (NY).

Fabrication
of the Sensor Chips
The fabrication process
of Si NW-ISFETs was reported earlier.27 In short, the sensor chips were fabricated on SOI wafers using a
combination of nanoimprint lithography and photolithography processes.27 Depending on the dimensions of the SiO2 hard mask, which we used in our processes, we got different values
for absolute threshold voltages of the Si NW-ISFET sensors (compare Figures 2 and 4).68 Nanowire structures comprise
highly p-doped individual drains and a common source contact, which
are etched out of the top silicon layer of the SOI wafers. The nanowire
regions of typically 15 μm length and 100–200 nm width
are left intrinsic and depending on the thickness of the silicon (40–60
nm) are either fully or partly depleted, which leads to the accumulation
type transistor characteristics. The etching profile results in trapezoid
cross sections,69 which are covered by
a thin SiO2 gate oxide of 6–8 nm in an almost wrapped
around gate structure, which is partly still in contact with the BOX
supporting the mechanic stability and giving the possibility for back
gating. Typically, we fabricate devices with subthreshold swings of
100–120 mV/dec,68 which is far away
from the ideal values of about 60 mV/dec. Most likely, the quality
of the gate oxide could be further improved by annealing in forming
gas to decrease the subthreshold slope values. For biosensor applications,
this subthreshold swing should show a minimum hysteresis. In addition,
the channel-to-channel and the chip-to-chip variations in the Si NW
should be small to enable differential readout and robustness of the
biosensor assays. Over the past years we opimized the fabrication
process in different steps and published these protocols earlier.27,68−71

The sensor chips with arrays of Si NW-ISFETs measured 10 mm
in length and 7 mm in width. The chips were wire-bonded onto specially
designed PCBs. The wire bonds and the contact lines were then covered
with PDMS to protect them from damage.

Fabrication of the Microfluidic
Channels
A soft lithography
process for the realization of PDMS microfluidic channels was described
in an earlier report.72 In short, an aluminum
mask with fluidic channel designs was patterned using optical lithography.
The fluidic channel structures were then transferred to a SU-8 resist
layer by patterning in another lithography process. The patterned
SU-8 served as a mold for the production of microfluidic channels
in the PDMS layer. The PDMS layer (with microchannel width = 100 μm,
height = 20 μm, and length = 4 mm) was sealed onto the sensor
chip by subjecting both to an UV–ozone treatment for 5 min
at 28–32 mW/cm2 (UVO cleaner 144AX, Jelight Company
Inc., CA). The surface-oxidized PDMS and Si NW-ISFET chips were then
aligned and gently pressed to ensure bonding. After 1 day, the microfluidic
devices were permanently sealed (as shown in Figure 1e,f) and ready to be used for the chemiluminescence
assays.

Biofunctional Layer Immobilization
The surface modification
process started with a surface activation step to increase the density
of hydroxyl group on the Si NW surfaces. For this, sensor chips were
treated with freshly prepared piranha solution (H2O2/H2SO4 1:3) for 10 min at 60° C.
A gas-phase silanization process was followed for rendering the Si
NW surfaces with ultrathin GPTMS siloxane layers, which is detailed
in our previous report.27 Eight hundred
picoliter volume of 2 μM PSA-specific aptamers in 10 mM PB was
used for functionalization of aptamers onto the Si NWs with or without
using a microspotting device (see the Supporting Information S3). The chips were incubated in a humid environment
(overnight incubation). After the incubation step, sensor chips were
cleaned with 10 mM PB and blow-dried in N2. To block the
remaining GPTMS functional sites, 1 M EA solution was drop-casted
over sensor chips for 30 min, thoroughly rinsed with deionized water,
and blow-dried in N2. In the end, increasing concentrations
of PSA ranging from 1 pg/mL to 1 μg/mL were allowed to bind
on the Si NW-ISFETs chips, each for 2 h in a humid environment (Supporting
Information, Figure 5e). After each PSA
concentration binding, the Si NW-ISFETs chips were rinsed with 10
mM PB and the electronic characterizations were done.

Electrical
Measurements
For the experiments, where
we compared the performance of the Si NW-ISFET platform with microscale
Si ISFETs (see the Supporting Information S5), a 16-channel, portable amplifier system was used.20 A semiconductor parameter analyzer (Keithley 4200, Tektronix
GmbH, Germany) was used for the measurements of Si NWs in an ISFET
configuration. An external Ag/AgCl reference electrode (DRIREF-450)
from World Precision Instruments GmbH was used as electrochemical
gate contact. In the case of the p-type, microscale Si ISFETs, a drain–source
voltage Vds of −2 V was applied,
whereas the gate–source voltage Vgs was swept from 0 to −2 V. For the Si NW-ISFETs, a Vds of −100 mV was used, whereas Vgs was swept from 0 to −1 V. In all the
above cases, Vth was calculated by implementing
the transconductance gm extrapolation
method by plotting the first derivative of Ids. The Vth is given by the Vgs axis intercept of the linear extrapolation
of gm.27

Chemiluminescence Assays
Twenty micromolar aptamer
solution (0.5 μL/min for 15 min) was flown through the microfluidic
channels for covalent immobilization of the receptor layer. This step
was followed by rinsing (5 μL/min for 1 min with PB) and blocking
of the exposed GPTMS sites using 16 mM EA (0.5 μL/min for 5
min). The Si NWs were then rinsed with PB (5 μL/min for 1 min).
Thereafter, the sample solutions with different concentrations of
PSA were flown into the microfluidic channels. In the last step, a
solution with 100 μg/mL anti-PSA-HRP antibodies was flown through
the channels. A flow rate of 10 μL/min was used for luminol
to generate the chemiluminescence and during microscopic detection.
In control experiments, PB solution with 20 μM of a nonspecific
aptamer sequence (5′-H3N-(CH2)6-AAAAATTAATTTCGAGCGGTAGTTTATCGAAA-3′) was used instead of
the PSA-specific DNA aptamers and flown at the same rate as with the
PSA-specific aptamer surfaces.

Chemiluminescence Detection
A Leica DMLM fluorescence
microscope connected to a Leica DFC300FX digital camera was used for
imaging the microfluidic channels and recording the images. For the
optical images, an exposure time of 200 ms was used with 1× optical
gain. The chemiluminescence signal was recorded with an exposure time
of 10 s and 10× optical gain, all in a dark background. The acquired
images were analyzed using ImageJ software (National Institute of
Health). Each PSA concentration was tested by two independent experiments
with respective controls and the values shown in Figure 3c,d correspond to an average
of three regions of interest in each experiment after the subtraction
of the background signal.
