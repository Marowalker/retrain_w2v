The
achievement of H2 detection, up to 25 ppm, at room
temperature using sulfur-treated, platinum (Pt)-decorated porous GaN
is reported in this study. This achievement is attributed to the large
lateral pore size, Pt catalyst, and surface treatment using organic
sulfide. The performance of H2-gas sensors is studied as
a function of the operating temperature by providing an adsorption
activation energy of 22 meV at 30 ppm H2, confirming the
higher sensitivity of the sulfide-treated Pt–porous GaN sensor.
Furthermore, the sensing response of the sulfide-treated Pt–porous
GaN gas sensor increases with the increase in porosity (surface-to-volume
ratio) and pore radii. Using the Knudsen diffusion–surface
reaction equation, the H2 gas concentration profile is
simulated and fitted within the porous GaN layer, revealing that H2 diffusion is limited by small pore radii because of its low
diffusion rate. The simulated gas sensor responses to H2 versus the pore diameter show the same trend as observed for the
experimental data. The sulfide-treated Pt–porous GaN sensor
achieves ultrasensitive H2 detection at room temperature
for 125 nm pore radii.

Introduction
Of late, hydrogen has
been established as a promising, clean, renewable,
and pollution-free alternative energy source1 and found applications in several fields such as spacecraft, transportation,
and petrochemical plants.2,3 However, hydrogen gas
poses certain safety concerns because it is odorless, highly volatile,
explosive, invisible, and extremely reactive with oxygen.4 In H2 applications, the safety during
transportation, storage, and usage is crucial. Safe monitoring of
H2 leakage with compact, long-life, low-power-consumption
sensors at room temperature is highly desired. However, H2-sensing elements require a typical temperature of 100–200
°C to accelerate certain chemical reactions, leading to high
energy consumption.5 GaN is a suitable
candidate for several harsh applications, including gas sensors. However,
GaN-based H2 sensors have disadvantages of a long response
time, high limit of detection of approximately 1000 ppm in the presence
of oxygen, and high operating temperature.6 To avoid these problems, GaN nanostructures among other semiconductor
materials,7,8 having structures such as pores, nanowires,
nanorods, and nanotubes, are good solutions because of their large
surface-to-volume ratio as well as the nanosize effect.9−14

The significant increase in the surface-to-volume ratio subjects
them to high trap-state densities if the surfaces are imperfectly
passivated. Additionally, it can increase fast charge-carrier recombination
rates and create additional energy barriers at the semiconductor surface.14,15 Furthermore, band bending on the lateral surfaces of GaN nanostructures
due to space-charge-related surface depletion can increase the surface
recombination rates and cause Fermi-level pinning.16,17 To overcome these problems of GaN nanostructures, various surface
passivation technologies using organic and inorganic materials have
been extensively investigated. Among them, sulfur-based compounds,
such as sodium sulfide (NaS2) and ammonium sulfide ((NH4)2S), are mainly used for passivating n-type GaN,
enhancing its optical and electrical properties.18 On the other hand, short-carbon-chain 1,2-ethanedithiol
(EDT) (C2H4(SH)2) is used for ultrathin
bifunctional surface treatment, in which the S atoms can replace the
surface oxide, simultaneously acting as a ligand for attaching the
metal ion co-catalysts by forming strong covalent bonds.19 Recently, researchers have investigated the
contact resistance, emission enhancement of InGaN/GaN nanowire light-emitting
diodes, and enhanced photochemical water splitting, which have been
treated with 1,8-octanedithiol and EDT (1,2-ethanedithiol) solutions.20,21 However, the performance of compact, high-efficiency H2-gas sensors based on sulfur-treated porous GaN fabricated by planar
technology and operating at room temperature, without input power
for the sensor, has not yet been explored.

In this work, combining
the sulfur passivation of porous GaN nanostructures
at different porosities (surface-to-volume ratios) with Pt nanoparticles,
the H2-gas detection performance is enhanced at room temperature.
The sensitivity of the H2-gas sensor is compared, with
and without sulfur passivation. The sensitivity of the sensor is studied
as a function of the GaN porosity (surface-to-volume ratio) and temperature.
A model is proposed to theoretically describe the effect of the surface-to-volume
ratio and passivation on the sensor performance.

Results and Discussion
Figure 1 shows the
morphology of the porous GaN surface after etching for 10, 20, and
30 min. The pore-size distribution and porosity were determined for
different etching times, using ImageJ software, as shown in Figure 1. The error in the
pore diameters was estimated to be ±10 nm. The porosity was estimated
from the enhancement of the threshold tool to select the areas of
porosity from the scanning electron microscope (SEM) images using
the same software.23 The error in the porosity
was estimated to ±5%. In the SEM images, it was observed that
for a short etching time of 10 min (Figure 1a) the pores were circular with an average
diameter of 160 nm and a porosity of approximately 29%. As the etching
time was increased to 20 min (Figure 1b), the pores collapsed with a nearby pore, growing
and increasing the average pore diameter to 180 nm and the porosity
to 42%. These larger pores were still circular. For an etching time
of 30 min (Figure 1c), the pores collapsed, forming longer pores with lengths of a few
hundred nanometers. The average pore diameter was approximately 250
nm, and the porosity was 58%.

Figure 1 (a–c) Surface morphology of the porous
GaN structure, generated
after photochemical etching for 10, 20, and 30 min, respectively.
Scale bar: 1 μm.

To determine the changes in the chemical properties, before
and
after sulfur treatment, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements
were performed for porous GaN and sulfur-treated porous GaN. Figure 2a,b depicts the Ga
3s/S 2p comparison between the two samples. A clear shoulder at around
163.4 eV emerges in the treated sample, confirming the presence of
sulfur. The additional S 2p contribution was fitted using two (S 2p3/2, S 2p1/2) doublets. The S 2p3/2 components
were located at 162.5 and 163.4 eV, attributed to the Ga–S–C24,25 and C–S–H bonds,25−27 respectively. Figure 2c,d shows the S 2s
comparison between the two samples. It is also clear that in the treated
sample a peak at ∼227.3 eV emerges, confirming the presence
of sulfur. The S 2s core level was fitted with two peaks located at
226.7 and 227.7 eV, attributed to the Ga–S25 and C–S–H bonds,28 respectively.

porous GaN: (a, b) Ga 3s/S 2p region and (c, d) S 2s region.

It is to be noted that on analyzing
samples, as-grown and after
sulfur treatment and Pt deposition (Figure S3 in the Supporting Information), traces of Pt element were detected
on the sulfur-treated samples and their concentration was near the
detection limit of the XPS machine.

Figure 3a shows
the response of a Pt–porous GaN gas sensor with a porosity
of 58% (higher surface-to-volume ratio), before and after sulfur treatment
at room temperature. It is determined that prior to passivation the
sensitivity varies from 40 to 59%, whereas the variation of the H2 concentration from 30 to 300 ppm exhibits a repeatable response.
However, after treatment, the device response increased to 65% for
a H2 concentration of 30 ppm. This increase in response,
for a lower H2 concentration, is due to the effect of sulfur.
The untreated gas sensor device shows saturation at a concentration
of 130 ppm (Figure 3b). This may be attributed to the saturation of the adsorbed H2 atoms at the porous surface, resulting in the full coverage
of the porous surface area, which may block further adsorption and
interaction of the H2 atoms with the sensing surface. However,
for the sulfur-treated sensor, the response is significantly more
on increasing the H2 concentration. Thus, such treatment
drastically improves the performance of H2-gas sensors
at room temperature. This enhancement is due to the presence of sulfur,
which effectively removes the surface defects on porous GaN by forming
gallium ethanedithiolates, thus improving the surface stability. Due
to the presence of Pt nanoparticles on the surface, the two nearest
gallium ethanedithiolates and the sulfide atom can combine with hydrogen.17 This process is based on hydrosulfurization,
which is catalyzed by metal sulfides, as per the following equation: .29 Furthermore,
the H2 gas molecules near the sensor surface are dissociated
and the hydrogen atoms combine with the sulfide atom. Thus, the electrical
response of the gas sensor device is improved because of the decrease
of the charge recombination rates, thereby enhancing charge extraction.

with and without sulfide treatment at room temperature: (a) response
versus time and (b) response versus H2 concentration.

Figure 4a,b depicts
the effect of temperature on the sensitivity of a sulfur-treated Pt–porous
GaN device with a porosity of 58% at a H2 gas concentration
of 60 ppm. The effect of temperature on the performance of the sensor
was investigated at 23, 60, and 80 °C. The responses of the sensor
at 80 °C were higher compared to those at 23 °C because
the thermal energy at a higher temperature is sufficiently high to
overcome the activation energy barrier of the chemical reaction between
sulfur (S) and the disassociated H2-gas molecules.30−33 On increasing the working temperature up to 80 °C, we note
that the sensor responses between 30 and 300 ppm H2 were
approximately 2-fold higher than those measured at room temperature.
The parameters that limit the gas-sensing characteristics of porous
materials are the surface-to-volume ratio and the surface morphology.32,34 The enhancement in the response is evident at higher temperatures.

Figure 4 (a) Effect
of temperature on H2-gas detector with a
porosity of 58%. (b) Arrhenius plot of the sulfide-treated Pt–porous
GaN gas sensor versus the operating temperature (1000/T) at 60 ppm H2.

The EDT/Pt–porous GaN sensor shows excellent response
compared
to that of GaN nanostructures,33,35,36 proving that sensors based on EDT/Pt–porous GaN are more
promising for detecting low concentration of H2 at room
temperature.

The conductivity of an n-type semiconductor at
room temperature
is expressed by the following relationship: σ = σ0 exp(−Ea/(kBT)),37,38 where σ is the electrical conductivity, Ea is the activation energy, kB is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the room temperature
in Kelvin. By plotting the logarithm of the response versus 1/T, as shown in Figure 4b, the activation energy of the EDT/Pt–porous
GaN sensor calculated from the slope of the Arrhenius plot is approximately
22 meV. This value is smaller than the activation energy value of
25 meV obtained for GaN NWs and 29.4 meV obtained for GaN nanotubes.33,39 This smaller value of the activation energy due to the sulfur treatment
confirms the higher sensitivity of the sulfide-treated Pt–porous
GaN sensor. Increasing the porosity (surface-to-volume ratio) of porous
GaN increases the specific surface area, strongly influencing the
sensor detectability.

Figure 5a shows
the response of sulfide-treated Pt–porous GaN with respect
to time, for different porosities of 29, 42, and 58% at room temperature.
It was observed that the response to H2 increases with
the increase in porosity. Therefore, a porosity of 58% drastically
enhances the response to H2 gas. Figure 5b shows that on increasing the pore radius
(increasing the porosity), at 30 ppm H2 gas, the exposure
area of EDT/Pt–porous GaN increases, which is responsible for
the higher response. The diffusion rate of H2 gas is very
high for larger pore sizes on the upper layer of a thin film. To clarify
the porosity outcomes measured experimentally from sulfide-treated
Pt–porous GaN gas sensors, the influence of H2-gas
transport on the sensitivity of porous GaN was investigated theoretically.

Figure 5 Effect
of porosity on H2 detection at room temperature:
(a) versus time and (b) versus the porosity.

The mechanism of gas diffusion through a porous material
depends
on the size of pores, the surface diffusion, and the Knudsen diffusion.
The Knudsen diffusion coefficient (Dk)
is given by eq 1 for
a mesoporous film 1  where T is the temperature, r is
the pore radius, R is the gas constant,
and M is the molecular weight of the diffusing H2 gas.

To simulate the H2 concentration within
the porous GaN
layer, depending on the pore size, we use the diffusion equation, eq 2, which depends on the
concentration of the gas in the layer and the gas diffusion and surface
reaction rates40 2  where C is the concentration
of H2, t is the time, x is the thickness of porous GaN, Dk is
the diffusion coefficient, and K is the rate constant
of the surface reaction. Solving the equation in the steady-state
condition (∂CA/∂t = 0), the gas concentration profile is given by eq 3 3  where L is the porous layer
thickness. The gas concentration profile depends on the pore size,
if K is constant. Figure 6 shows the gas concentration profiles simulated
using eq 3 for a 300
nm thick porous GaN layer at various pore sizes (80, 90, and 125 nm)
and at K = 100 000 s–1.
The profiles change on changing .

Figure 6 Simulated H2 concentration
profiles within a porous
GaN layer at different values of  corresponding
to pore diameters of 160,
180, and 250 nm and at K = 100 000 s–1. The film thickness (L) and surface concentration
(Cs) were set to 300 μm and 30 ppm,
respectively. (The inset shows the cross-sectional SEM image; scale
bar: 500 nm.)

The gas concentration
decreases as H2 diffuses toward
the bottom of the porous GaN, depending on the pore diameter. The
concentration difference is negligible between the surface and bottom
layers for a larger pore diameter (250 nm). However, on decreasing
the pore diameter to 160 nm, the concentration difference increases,
indicating that most of the H2 gas molecules cannot reach
the bottom of the porous GaN if the layer is dense. The region where
H2 gas cannot reach does not contribute to the sensor response.
It can be assumed from the simulation results that an increase in
the pore size is likely to increase the H2 concentration
in the porous film, which increases the sensor response. This simulation
result demonstrates the relationship between the pore size and normalized
concentration, for different diffusion coefficients, Dk. The gas concentration in porous GaN is not constant
but decreases with the increase in the diffusion depth, because of
the surface reaction. We assumed that there is a uniform stack of
infinitesimally thin sheets with electric conductance σ(x). The conductance of the porous layer is given by the
integral of σ(x) between x = 0 and L.37 The conductance,
σ(x), is defined as the product of the conductance
in air, σ0, and the sensitivity constants given by eq 4 4  where a and CA are the sensitivity constants.
As the resistance is
the inverse of the conductance, the total resistance of the sensing
layer is equal to the integration of 1/σ(x)
from the thickness of the porous GaN layer from x = 0 to x = L. The sensor response
(S) can be obtained by eq 5(35) 5  The response (gas sensitivity)
of the sensor, S, is the ratio of Ra to Rg. Figure 7a,b shows the simulated sensor
response to H2 gas at room temperature as a function of
the pore radius, at different
H2 concentrations of (a) 30 ppm and (b) 200 ppm, respectively.
The experimental data are plotted in the same figures, for both H2 concentrations, showing the same trend obtained for a 300
nm thick porous GaN layer and the simulated curves. For smaller pore
radii, the experimental response values are smaller than theoretical
data due to large distribution in pores size.

Figure 7 Simulated and experimental
sensor responses to H2 concentrations
of (a) 30 ppm and (b) 200 ppm at room temperature, as a function of
the pore radius of the porous sensing layer. The circles (●)
correspond to experimental sensor responses for porous GaN with different
pore radii, using 300 nm thick porous GaN.

The same trend in the experimental and theoretical data reveals
that an increase in the film pore size enhances the sensor response
to H2 gas. It is to be noted that the sensor response to
H2 does not show saturation, as seen in the simulation
curve.

Conclusions
In summary, a new sulfide-treated Pt–porous
GaN H2 sensor was successfully fabricated. The sensing
performance of the
sulfide-surface-treated Pt/porous GaN sensor was enhanced, with high
sensitivity to low H2 gas concentration (30 ppm) at room
temperature. The sensing characteristics depend on the operating temperature,
and an adsorption activation energy of 22 meV at 30 ppm H2 was determined. In addition, an increase in the porosity (surface-to-volume
ratio) affected the performance of the gas sensors because of changes
in the pore radius and density. The H2 gas concentration
profiles of EDT/Pt–porous GaN at various pore radii were simulated
using Knudsen diffusion. The simulation results revealed that H2 diffuses easily from pores having a large diameter. The sensor
responses with respect to the pore diameter showed the same trend
for the simulation and experimental data. The sulfur-treated Pt–porous
GaN sensor involves low-technology fabrication steps, is of low cost,
and provides high performance at room temperature. Hence, the sulfur-treated
device is promising for improving hydrogen sensitivity in sensor applications.

Experimental
Section
Synthesis of Porous GaN Nanostructures
Porous gallium
nitride was fabricated by metal-assisted electroless etching.22 The unintentionally doped n-type GaN film used
in this study was grown on a c-axis (0001) sapphire
substrate with a resistivity below 0.05 Ω cm, purchased from
Xiamen Powerway Advanced Material Co., Ltd. The thickness of the GaN
film was approximately 30 μm, and its carrier concentration
was 3.4 × 1017 cm–3. The GaN samples
were cleaned by sonication in acetone followed by 2-propanol for 5
min in each solution. Furthermore, the samples were immersed in nitric
acid (HNO3) at 65 °C for 15 min, after which they
were rinsed with deionized (DI) water and methanol. Two narrow stripes
of 10 nm thick Pt, separated by a few millimeters, were deposited
on the GaN samples using a sputtering system. The samples were then
etched in the H2O2/HF/CH3OH (2:1:2)
solution, under UV illumination, for different etching times (10,
20, and 30 min). After chemical etching, the samples were removed
from the solution and rinsed with DI water. The X-ray diffraction
pattern of wurtzite porous GaN nanostructures etched for 30 min is
depicted in Figure S1 in the Supporting
Information. For surface passivation, the porous GaN samples were
immersed in EDT (99.99%, Sigma-Aldrich) for 5 min, after which they
were rinsed with ethanol and dried with N2.21 Pt nanoparticles of 5 nm radii were then deposited
on the surface of the porous GaN layer using an ultrahigh vacuum chamber
for nanoparticles production (Mantis Deposition Ltd.). Before the
sensing measurements, Pt/Ni electrical contacts were deposited by
a sputtering system on the top surface, with a thickness of 100 nm,
using an electrode hard mask. The image of the fabricated sensor device
is depicted in Figure S2 in the Supporting
Information.

Physical Characterization
An FEI’s
Magellan
400-FEG scanning electron microscope (SEM), operating at 5 keV beam
energy, was used for analyzing the morphology of porous GaN. X-ray
photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was carried out to analyze the surface
property of porous GaN, before and after surface treatment. The XPS
data were obtained using an Axis Ultra DLD system (Kratos, U.K.) with
an A1 Kα radiation source (hν = 1486.8
eV), under a vacuum of 10–9 mbar. The binding energy
was calibrated according to the C 1s peak at 284.8 eV. The data were
analyzed using “CasaXPS”, and the peaks were fitted
using a Gaussian–Lorentzian function. The sensor was fixed
on a test stage consisting of a heater within a temperature-controlled
Teflon chamber. H2 gas was diluted with N2 gas
within a gas mixer and injected into the chamber at controlled flow
rates, using Bronkhorst mass flow meters and a controller. As dry
gases were used within the sealed-off test chamber, the relative humidity
within the chamber was assumed to be negligible. The response signal
of the device was measured using a computer-controlled Keithley Instruments
source measurement unit (KI 236). The source and gas flow rates were
controlled to a computer, using LABVIEW software. The sensor response
was defined as , where Ra and Rg are the
resistances of the gas sensor in air
and H2 gas, respectively.
