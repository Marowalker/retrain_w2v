A novel magnetic
nanocomposite of NixMn1–xFe2O4/carbonized chaff (x = 0.3, 0.5, and 0.7) has been
synthesized successfully via the co-carbonization and hydrothermal
method. The microstructure, morphology, complex permittivity and permeability,
and microwave absorbing properties were systematically studied by
X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and a vector network
analyzer. Compared to the pure Ni0.5Mn0.5Fe2O4 NPs, the Ni0.3Mn0.7Fe2O4/carbonized chaff-N2 composite exhibits
an optimal microwave absorption property at 4 mm as the mass percent
of carbonized chaff is 10 wt %, the maximum reflection loss of which
can reach −14.58 dB at 1.91 GHz with the −10 dB frequency
bandwidth in the range of 1.46–2.41 GHz (0.95 GHz). The enhanced
electromagnetic wave absorbing performance is ascribed to the good
synergistic effect among laminated structures, better impedance matching
condition, strong natural resonance loss, Debye dipolar relaxation
to some extent, and so forth. Most importantly, this study provides
a novel way to prepare easily degradable, environment-friendly, and
high-efficiency electromagnetic wave absorbers by utilizing the structural
property of renewable biomaterials.

1 Introduction
For several decades, the
fast development of advanced electronic
equipment for military and commercial applications, for example, radar
detection systems, wireless network systems, satellite detection,
data communication, and so forth, has led to many problems such as
electromagnetic interference and electromagnetic compatibility. These
problems can affect the military security of strategic weapon, the
normal running of precise equipment, and even do harm to the human
health. Thus, there is a critical need for developing effective and
practical microwave absorbing materials (MAMs) with good performance.1−4

Usually, the MAMs include ferrites, metallic oxides, carbon
materials,
conducting polymer, and so forth;5−10 the MAMs can absorb the microwave effectively by transform electromagnetic
energy into thermal energy or make the microwave be dissipated by
the interference effect.11,12 The remarkable MAMs
should not only possess the advantages of tiny thickness, low density,
wide effective bandwidth, strong dielectric and magnetic loss, and
so forth but also process the performances such as biodegradability,
recyclable utilization, environmental protection, and so on. Because
of the excellent characteristics of degradable regeneration, diverse
microstructures, low density, low cost, and so forth, of biomaterials,
the preparation of MAMs based on the biomass is a promising approach
to realize the full utilization of various biological resources. However,
the biomaterials possess electromagnetic inertness in general and
the microwave loss is relatively limited, which restrict their application
as microwave absorbers. Therefore, much attention has been paid toward
the improvement of electromagnetic wave absorption performance in
biomass by compositing them with other materials to overcome these
deficiencies. Lee et al.13 investigated
the microwave absorption properties of rice husk ash (RHA) composited
with carbon nanotubes (CNTs). It was observed that the content of
CNTs can influence the ε′ and ε″ values
of the as-prepared composites, and the RHA/CNTs composite with the
CNTs content of 5 wt % exhibited an optimal microwave absorption property,
whose maximum reflection loss (RL) reached −27 dB at 11.7 GHz.
Lan et al.14 fabricated the bio-based helical
ferromagnetic particles via the Ni–Fe alloy electroplating
process; the complex permittivity and permeability of coated spirulina
were measured by a vector network analyzer (VNA). These results showed
that the samples after heat treatment displayed an optimal microwave
absorbing properties, and the maximum RL values are −10.6 dB
at 15.2 GHz for 1 mm and −10.2 dB at 8.8 GHz for 1.5 mm. Oka
et al.15 found that the microwave absorption
characteristics of the half-carbonized wood with Mn–Zn ferrite
coating could be adjusted by controlling the processing temperature.
Moreover, both the bending strength and the matching frequency can
achieve the proper value under the treatment of 250 °C. Zhu et
al.16 synthesized a novel composite with
the surface of CBC coated by Ni nanoparticles, which forms a three-dimensional
network structure. It can be found that the CBC/Ni nanocomposite exhibits
the higher microwave absorption effect than the pure CBC in 0.6–13.2
GHz frequency range. Similarly, Ren et al.17 synthesized CBC decorated with CoFe2O4 nanocrystals
by a solvothermal method; the composite exhibited excellent microwave
absorption performance with a maximum RL of −45 dB at 8.6 GHz
(2 mm) as the mass content of CBC/CoFe2O4 is
10 wt %. Kwon et al.18 investigated the
effect of carbonization temperature on the electromagnetic shielding
effectiveness, resistivity, and mechanical performance of carbonized
medium density fiber (MDF). The results indicated that the MDF carbonized
below 700 °C shows the limited electromagnetic shielding values;
however, it shows the high electromagnetic shielding values as the
carbonization temperature is in the range of 900–1500 °C.

Overall, the above investigations point out that the microwave
absorbing property of the biomaterials can be enhanced after composited
with other materials, in which ferrites are good choices for its chemical
and thermal stability, high Curie temperature, excellent magnetic
loss ability, and so on.19 MFe2O4 (M = Ni, Mn etc.) nanoparticle has been widely used
in many fields, for example, magnetic recording media, magnetic fluids,
magnetic resonance imaging, and microwave absorption.20−22 On the other hand, the carbonized chaff is an excellent biomaterial
with good dielectric loss properties, low density, biodegradable and
recyclable utilization, corrosion resistance, low cost, specific structures,
and so forth.23 Therefore, combining carbonized
chaff with MFe2O4 nanoferrites may be a feasible
strategy to enhance the microwave absorption properties of this biomaterial.

Furthermore, the operating frequency band of many radars has been
extended to the low frequency now. Thus, the detection frequency of
modern metrewave radar is mainly focused in the low frequency of L-band
and S-band. In addition, the electromagnetic wave radiated from electronic
equipment used in our daily life is mainly located in the low-frequency
range as well; however, the existing investigations on the MAMs are
mainly focused in the frequency range of the 2–18 GHz, thus
the microwave absorbing performance of which will be much worse to
the low-frequency electromagnetic wave. This brings forward a strong
requirement to design new MAMs with good electromagnetic wave absorbing
properties in low-frequency band.

Therefore, in this study,
the NixMn1–xFe2O4/carbonized
chaff (x = 0.3, 0.5, and 0.7) composites with different
amounts of carbonized chaff have been prepared via the hydrothermal
synthesis method. The crystal structures, morphologies, relative permittivity
and permeability, and electromagnetic wave absorbing properties of
as-prepared NixMn1–xFe2O4/carbonized chaff composites
were studied by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy
(SEM), and VNA. The results of investigation displayed that the Ni0.3Mn0.7Fe2O4/carbonized chaff-N2 composite exhibited an optimal electromagnetic wave absorbing
performance in the low-frequency range of 0.1–3.0 GHz when
the mass content of carbonized chaff is 10 wt %, which can be used
as a novel electromagnetic wave absorbing candidate in this band.

2 Characterization
The crystalline structure of the as-prepared
composites was characterized
by the DX-2700 X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (XRD,
German Bruker D8, λ = 0.154 nm). The microstructure of the composites
was studied by the SEM (Hitachi S-8020). The hybrid with a tantamount
mass content of the composite and paraffin was pressed into circular
rings (Rout: 7.00 mm, Rin: 3.04 mm, thickness: 2–5 mm) for the detection
of S-parameters, that is, S21 and S11, by VNA (TIANDA TD3618C)
in 0.1–3.0 GHz frequency range. Thus, the electromagnetic parameters
and microwave absorbing properties can be calculated based on the
measured S-parameters and the theory of Nicolson
and Ross.24

3 Results
and Discussion
3.1 X-ray Diffraction Analysis
The XRD
patterns of NixMn1–xFe2O4/carbonized chaff (x = 0.3, 0.5, and 0.7) composites are shown in Figure 1. The diffraction
peaks at 2θ = 30.5°,
35.8°, 43.6°, 57.2°, and 62.9° are corresponded
to the (220), (311), (400), (511), and (440) planes of the spinel
structure NixMn1–xFe2O4;25,26 the diffraction
peak around 2θ = 44.9° is assigned to the (111) plane of
nickel28 because a small amount of Ni2+ was reduced to pure nickel in ethylene glycol solution at
high temperature.27 Moreover, the diffraction
peak of carbonized chaff cannot be observed in the XRD pattern, which
may be attributed to the less content and existence form of amorphous
state.29

Ni0.7Mn0.3Fe2O4/carbonized
chaff composites.

3.2 Micromorphology
Observation
The microstructures
of Ni0.5Mn0.5Fe2O4 NPs
and NixMn1–xFe2O4/carbonized chaff (x = 0.3, 0.5, and 0.7) composites are shown in Figure 2. Figure 2a shows that the Ni0.5Mn0.5Fe2O4 NPs present the bonded ball-like granules, and Figure 2b–e displays
the Ni0.5Mn0.5Fe2O4/carbonized
chaff composites with different contents of the carbonized chaff,
which indicates that the Ni0.5Mn0.5Fe2O4 NPs also present a bonding growth morphology and form
a coarse, poriferous, and lax structure. Only a little carbonized
chaff can be seen in the elliptical area shown in Figure 2b for the very small amount
in the composite; however, with the increased content of carbonized
chaff, it is shown in Figure 2c that the NPs were adhered well on the surface of carbonized
chaff as the content is 10 wt % . Moreover, it can also be seen that
the surface of carbonized chaff is not coated well with the NPs for
excess amount of carbonized chaff; some area of carbonized chaff is
bared as the content added to 15 wt % as shown in Figure 2d, which is not conducive to
enhance the microwave absorbing performance of the composite. Especially,
in Figure 2e, when
the carbonized chaff content is added to 20 wt %, irregularly stacked
lamellar microstructures of carbonized chaff can be clearly seen in
the square area. Thus, we can conclude that the appropriate mass content
of carbonized chaff is about 10 wt %, and the surface of carbonized
chaff can be coated well just enough. In addition, the morphologies
of the Ni0.3Mn0.7Fe2O4/carbonized chaff 10 wt % and Ni0.7Mn0.3Fe2O4/carbonized chaff 10 wt % are shown in Figure 2f,g, which is quite
similar with the Ni0.5Mn0.5Fe2O4/carbonized chaff 10 wt %. Besides, the macromorphology of
the as-prepared hybrid is shown in Figure 2h; the hybrid presents the characteristic
of paramagnetic materials, which can be attracted by the magnet for
being coated by ferrite nanoparticles.

chaff (h).

3.3 Electromagnetic
Characteristics
Generally,
it is well known that the electromagnetic wave absorbing performance
of the composites is related to the complex permittivity (ε
= ε′ – jε″) and permeability (μ
= μ′ – jμ″). The real part of permittivity
and permeability represents the storage capabilities of the electromagnetic
wave energy, as well as the dissipation capabilities can be represented
by the imaginary part in general.30−32 It can be seen from Figure 3a that the ε′
values of the composites are higher than the pure Ni0.5Mn0.5Fe2O4 when the mass content
of the carbonized chaff is less than or equal to 10 wt %, indicating
that a moderate amount of carbonized chaff can enhance the ε′
values in the composites. However, the ε′ values will
reduce in the whole range with the further increase of carbonized
chaff content. Besides, the ε′ values of all samples
decrease gradually with the enhancement of frequency in the measurement
range. The imaginary parts of permittivity are shown in Figure 3b, and the ε″
values of Ni0.5Mn0.5Fe2O4/carbonized chaff composites with the 5 and 10 wt % content of carbonized
chaff are increased first and then decreased slightly, while the composites
with 15 and 20 wt % content of carbonized chaff keep on increasing
with increasing frequency. The Ni0.5Mn0.5Fe2O4/carbonized chaff composite exhibited the highest
ε″ value when the mass content of carbonized chaff was
5 wt %, the maximum value reached 0.97 dB at 1.84 GHz. The enhanced
ε″ values can be explained by the multiple polarization
originated from the special structures of carbonized chaff, and electron
polarization originated from electron exchange between Fe3+ and M2+ (M = Ni and Mn).33,34 This implies
a relatively stronger storage capability and dissipative ability for
EM wave energy.

Figure 3 Frequency dependence of (a) real and (b) imaginary parts
of complex
relative permittivity, and (c) real and (d) imaginary parts of complex
relative permeability of Ni0.5Mn0.5Fe2O4/carbonized chaff composites with different carbonized
chaff contents.

The frequency-dependent
real and imaginary parts of complex permeability
are shown in Figure 3c,d. It can be noted that the real part and the corresponding imaginary
part of permeability in Ni0.5Mn0.5Fe2O4/carbonized chaff composites with different carbonized
chaff contents suggest an increasing trend with the variation of frequency.
On the other hand, the μ′ and μ″ values
of the Ni0.5Mn0.5Fe2O4/carbonized chaff composites are higher than those of pure Ni0.5Mn0.5Fe2O4 when the mass
content of carbonized chaff was less than 10 wt %, resulting from
the appropriate amount of carbonized chaff which can provide enough
carrying surface to prevent the aggregation of Ni0.5Mn0.5Fe2O4 NPs, which is conducive to enhance
the small size effect of NPs. However, the μ′ and μ″
values will decrease when the mass content of carbonized chaff further
increased because of the magnetic inertness of carbonized chaff. In
addition, the μ″ values of all samples were higher than
their ε″ values because of the excellent magnetic properties
of Ni0.5Mn0.5Fe2O4 NPs.

As we all know, the microwave attenuation of the absorber mainly
generates from the dielectric and magnetic loss. In order to investigate
this property of the as-prepared composites, the dielectric loss tangents
(tan δε = ε″/ε′)
and magnetic loss tangents (tan δμ = μ″/μ′)
have been calculated and shown in Figure 4. It can be found that the values of tan
δε in all samples are very close to each other
within the 0.1–3.0 GHz frequency range shown in Figure 4a, and the tan δε of composites with 5 and 10 wt % content of carbonized
chaff are slightly larger than others in average. Compared to pure
Ni0.5Mn0.5Fe2O4 NPs, the
tan δε values of Ni0.5Mn0.5Fe2O4/carbonized chaff composites are improved
with the increasing content of carbonized chaff in a suitable range.
This might be attributed to the structural synergy of different components.
The tan δμ values of all samples increase at
the beginning and then reduce with the enhancement of frequency. The
Ni0.5Mn0.5Fe2O4/carbonized
chaff 10 wt % displays the highest tan δμ value
of 1.4 at 2.0 GHz as shown in Figure 4b, which exhibits a strong magnetic loss over other
composites. Moreover, for all Ni0.5Mn0.5Fe2O4/carbonized chaff composites, the tan δμ values are higher than the tan δε values, indicating that the magnetic loss plays the primary role
in the electromagnetic wave absorbing process over the whole frequency
range.

3.4 Microwave Absorption Properties
Generally
speaking, the electromagnetic wave absorbing property of composites
is expressed by the microwave RL, which can be calculated based on
the transmission line theory by using the complex permittivity and
permeability at a given thickness of absorber35−37 1  Here, Z0 is the
impedance of free space, Zin the input
characteristic impedance, εr and μr the complex permittivity and permeability of the absorber, f the frequency, d the thickness of the
absorbent, and c the velocity of light in free space.
Thus, the microwave RL can be expressed as 2  

The effective absorption
bandwidth
is defined as the corresponding frequency range of RL < −10
dB because more than 90% of electromagnetic energy can be dissipated
if the RL of absorber is below −10 dB. Figure 5 shows a comparison of the calculated RL
curves for Ni0.5Mn0.5Fe2O4/carbonized chaff composites with different carbonized chaff contents
at a thickness of 4 mm. It is clear that the position and intensity
of RL peaks can be manipulated by adjusting the mass content of carbonized
chaff in the composites. The maximum intensity of absorption peak
will increase first and then decrease with the increasing content
of carbonized chaff, which reaches the maximum value with a content
of 10 wt %. An optimal RL value of −12.43 dB can be achieved
at 2.61 GHz because the effective absorption bandwidth is over the
frequency range of 2.17–2.93 GHz (0.76 GHz), which may be ascribed
to the preferable synergistic effect of dielectric and magnetic components
within the nanoscale and the porous structure of carbonized chaff.
Moreover, the carbonized chaff provided excellent carrier for Ni0.5Mn0.5Fe2O4 NPs, which can
prevent the compact agglomeration of Ni0.5Mn0.5Fe2O4 particles to some extent, which may benefit
for improving the microwave absorption property.

Figure 5 Comparison of RLs for
the Ni0.5Mn0.5Fe2O4/carbonized
chaff with different carbonized chaff
contents at the same layer thickness of 4 mm.

In order to investigate the effect of thickness on the microwave
absorbing performance of absorber, the RL curves of the Ni0.5Mn0.5Fe2O4/carbonized chaff 10 wt
% composite at different thicknesses are illustrated in Figure 6. It suggests that the RL value
of −12.43 dB at 2.61 GHz obtained previously at 4 mm is the
optimum performance of this composite. Moreover, the absorption peaks
of Ni0.5Mn0.5Fe2O4/carbonized
chaff 10 wt % composite gradually shifts to the lower-frequency range
with the increase of absorber layer thickness, which can be explained
by the quarter wavelength mechanism38,39 3  

Figure 6 Microwave RL curves of
the Ni0.5Mn0.5Fe2O4/carbonized
chaff 10 wt % composite with different
absorber thicknesses.

The results indicate that the electromagnetic wave absorbing
performance
of the composite can be tuned effectively by changing its thickness.

Figure 7 displays
the RL value of the NixMn1–xFe2O4/carbonized chaff (x = 0.3, 0.5, and 0.7) prepared in different atmospheres
(d = 4 mm). It can be obviously observed that the
peak values of RL are enhanced with the increase of manganese ratio
in ferrites. The Ni0.3Mn0.7Fe2O4/carbonized chaff composite presents an optimal electromagnetic
wave absorbing properties. The maximum RL reached −13.46 dB
at 2.2 GHz and the effective bandwidth covers from 1.8 to 2.7 GHz
(0.9 GHz). Furthermore, it can be seen that the carbonization atmospheres
do play a crucial role in the determination of surface properties
and microwave absorption performance.40 There is a better microwave absorbing property in Ni0.3Mn0.7Fe2O4/carbonized chaff composite
prepared in the inert nitrogen atmosphere than that of those composites
prepared in air, and an optimal RL of −14.58 dB at 1.91 GHz
with an effective absorption frequency between 1.46 and 2.41 GHz (0.95
GHz) can be obtained. This is owing to that the more microstructural
morphologies of chaff can be retained as carbonized in nitrogen atmosphere,
which is beneficial to enhance microwave absorption for the microstructure
effect. Besides, detailed microwave absorption mechanisms will be
further explained in the following section. Moreover, the comparison
of electromagnetic wave absorption performance between Ni0.3Mn0.7Fe2O4/carbonized chaff-N2 and other ferrite composites reported in recent literature
has been listed in the Table 1.41−49 It can be noted that the microwave absorption performance of ferrites
in the GHz range can be improved by compositing them with other materials
processing different loss mechanisms; however, the frequency position
of absorbing peak corresponding to the Ni0.3Mn0.7Fe2O4/carbonized chaff-N2 composite
prepared here is obviously the lowest.

3.5 Microwave Absorption Mechanism
The
better impedance matching between the free space and absorber can
make more electromagnetic wave enter into the absorber to be dissipated.
In general, the impedance characteristic can be expressed by the following
formula50 4  where Zin and Z0 are the impedance values of the absorber and
the free space, respectively. Figure 8 shows the impedance matching ratios of the as-prepared
samples with the change of frequency. It can be observed that the Z values of Ni0.3Mn0.7Fe2O4/carbonized chaff-N2 composite with a layer
thickness of 4 mm are more closer to the free space at the frequency
of 1.97 GHz, which is attributed to the good matching relationship
between complex permeability and permittivity at this range. Furthermore,
it can also be found that the frequency ranges of Zin/Z0 approached to 1 in all
samples indicates the locations of absorption peaks just right, which
reflects the importance of impedance matching property in the microwave
absorption of composites.

Figure 8 Frequency-dependent Zin/Z0 values of NixMn1–xFe2O4/carbonized chaff-air
and Ni0.3Mn0.7Fe2O4/carbonized
chaff-N2 with 10 wt % carbonized chaff.

The another possible reason that may significantly
affect the magnetic
loss of the composite in GHz range is the eddy current loss, which
can be given by the following equation51 5  where μ0 is the permeability
in vacuum, σ the electrical conductivity, and d the thickness of the absorber. The eddy current loss is the main
reason for magnetic loss if the C0 maintains
the constant as the frequency is changed. Figure 9 shows the C0 curves of composites at the thickness of 4 mm, as shown in the graph,
and the C0 vary with change of frequency
in the whole measurement range, indicating that the eddy current loss
does not play a major role in the magnetic loss. Therefore, the magnetic
loss here may be caused by the natural resonance loss and so forth.

Figure 9 Eddy current
loss curves of NixMn1–xFe2O4/carbonized
chaff-air and Ni0.3Mn0.7Fe2O4/carbonized chaff-N2 with 10 wt % carbonized chaff.

Moreover, the relaxation process
of heterogeneous interface polarization
can be presented by the Cole–Cole semicircle, which has an
important influence on the dielectric loss behaviors of electromagnetic
wave absorbing materials. According to the Debye dipolar relaxation
theory, the complex permittivity can be expressed as follows52 6  where εs is the static dielectric
constant and ε∞ is the dielectric constant
at infinite frequency. The ε′−ε″
curves of the NixMn1–xFe2O4/carbonized chaff are
shown in Figure 10; however, one semicircle can be observed in each sample, indicating
the existence of only one Debye dipolar relaxation during the EM wave
absorption process. In addition, the Ni0.3Mn0.7Fe2O4/carbonized chaff-N2 composite
displays the largest radius among all the samples, and the deformed
semicircle implies the existence of other mechanisms, such as dipolar
polarization, Maxwell–Wagner relaxation, conductive loss, and
so on,53 which made a significant contribution
for improving the dielectric loss of microwave absorption.

loss curves of NixMn1–xFe2O4/carbonized
chaff-air, where x = 0.3 (a), 0.5 (b), 0.7 (c), and
Ni0.3Mn0.7Fe2O4/carbonized
chaff-N2 (d) with 10 wt % carbonized chaff.

Except for the absorption mechanisms mentioned
above, the laminated
structures of NixMn1–xFe2O4/carbonized chaff (x = 0.3, 0.5, and 0.7) composites may cause the multiple
reflection of microwave in the absorber by increasing the propagation
path of microwave among the layers, which can further enhance the
microwave absorption ability of the as-prepared composites. Overall,
we can clearly find that the carbonized chaff has a great potential
in the development of easily degradable, environment-friendly, and
high-efficiency MAMs.

4 Conclusions
In summary,
the NixMn1–xFe2O4/carbonized chaff (x = 0.3, 0.5, and 0.7) composites with different contents
of carbonized chaff were synthesized successfully via the co-carbonization
and hydrothermal method, and their microwave absorption properties
were also researched in the low-frequency range of 0.1–3 GHz.
The results show that the electromagnetic wave absorbing property
of the as-prepared composite can be manipulated by adjusting the mass
content of carbonized chaff in hybrid. Compared to the pure Ni0.5Mn0.5Fe2O4 NPs, the Ni0.3Mn0.7Fe2O4/carbonized chaff-N2 hybrid exhibits an optimal electromagnetic wave absorbing
performance at 4 mm when the mass content of carbonized chaff is 10
wt %, and the maximum RL can reach −14.58 dB at 1.91 GHz with
the effective absorption bandwidth covering from 1.46 to 2.41 GHz
(0.95 GHz). This work reports a novel way to prepare easily degradable,
environment-friendly, and high-efficiency electromagnetic wave absorbers
by taking the advantages of renewable biomaterials.

5.2 Preparation of Carbonized
Chaff
The
chaff was washed by deionized water to remove impurities and then
impregnated in 10 wt % hydrochloric acid for 2 h to remove a small
amount of K, Ca, and other metal ions. Then, the chaff was washed
to a pH of 7 and dried at 40 °C. Later, the preceding chaff was
added into 300 mL solution 1.0 M NiCl2·6H2O for 24 h. Finally, the preprocessed
chaff was heated to 700 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C·min–1 in a horizontal tube furnace and then maintained
the temperature for 5 h to
carbonize.

5.3 Preparation of NixMn1–xFe2O4/Carbonized Chaff (x = 0.3, 0.5, and
0.7) Composites
Because the NPs of ferrite prepared by hydrothermal
method have
the advantages of good grain integrity, controllable particle size,
uniform distribution, low cost, easy to get suitable stoichiometry,
and crystal shape. Here, the NixMn1–xFe2O4/carbonized
chaff composite was synthesized via a typical hydrothermal method,54 and the brief synthesis process of the composites
is shown in Figure 11. First, 2.7 g of ferric chloride hexahydrate, 0.5 g of MnCl2·4H2O, and 0.6 g of NiCl2·6H2O were dissolved in 80 mL of ethylene glycol with continuous
stirring to form the homogeneous solution. Second, 9.6 g of NaAc,
2 g of polyethylene glycol, and carbonized chaff with different masses
were consecutively added into the preceding solution with continuous
stirring and ultrasonic dispersion for 45 min. Third, the obtained
mixed solution was transferred into a 150 mL Teflon-lined stainless
steel autoclave and heated at 200 °C for 24 h. Fourth, after
the autoclave was cooled down to room temperature, the precipitation
was separated from the solution and washed by ethanol for several
times. Finally, the precipitation was dried at 60 °C for 12 h
and the target product was obtained. Moreover, the NixMn1–xFe2O4/carbonized chaff composite with different ion ratios
can be prepared by changing the molar ratio of Ni2+ to
Mn2+ (i.e., γ = 1:1, 3:7, and 7:3). In order to investigate
the influence of carbonized chaff content on the microwave absorption
performance of composites, samples with contents of carbonized chaff
are 5, 10, 15, and 20 wt % were prepared through the same method as
mentioned above.
