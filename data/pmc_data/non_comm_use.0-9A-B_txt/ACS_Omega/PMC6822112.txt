Controlling the surface is necessary
to adjust the essential properties
and desired functions of nanomaterials and devices. For nanostructured
multivalent vanadium oxides, unwanted surface oxidation occurs at
ambient atmosphere generally and needs to be suppressed or avoided.
We describe the suppressed surface oxidation of VO2 nanostructures
through blocking oxygen adsorption. During an enhanced photoinduced
surface oxidation process, the increased oxidation states of vanadium
in VO2 nanostructures are suppressed by the use of an inert
atmosphere or coating. Intermediate oxidation states are observed,
and an ALD-TiO2 coating has a good antioxidant capacity
for preventing the formation of oxygen-enriched components. Such oxidation
suppression is beneficial to improving the stability of VO2 nanostructures. Controllable surface oxidation helps us to understand
the physical essentials of surface chemical reactions and achieve
better control of surface functions and performances on correlated
vanadium oxide nanostructures.

Introduction
Surfaces are among
essential and crucial issues in advanced materials,
coatings, and devices. Some modified and decorated surfaces have been
successfully exploited to improve the tolerance for surface corrosion1,2 and catalysis capability3,4 and even to create functional
materials5−7 with abnormal properties.8,9 In
general, surface engineering is critical to realize desired physical
or chemical characteristics of nanomaterials. In the past decades,
nanomaterials or low-dimensional structures have been widely investigated
with unique chemical, optical, electrical, and magnetic characteristics.10−12 Both the large surface area and high surface energy of nanomaterials
provide an alternative way to adjust physical and chemical properties,
which are beyond the capabilities of conventional bulk materials.
Thus, the demand of surface compositions and structures governed at
an atomic-layer scale is urgent because they can determine the construction
of advanced nanomaterials and the extension of device performances.
Various surface physical or chemical methods emerged and created more
opportunities for the existing nanomaterials to meet the requirements
of the real functions and devices. Meanwhile, a selected-area chemical
nanoengineering of vanadium dioxide nanoparticles and nanowires has
also been developed.13

Transition
metal oxide nanostructures have attracted considerable
attention with metal–insulator transition due to their capabilities
of extending Moore’s law in the communities of fundamental
physics and advanced electronics.14−18 As one of prototypical vanadium oxides, VO2 undergoes a metal–insulator transition at approximately 68
°C and has shown superior performance in electronic and optical
devices.19,20 Due to the existence of various oxidization
states of vanadium, VO2 is sensitive to oxygen and chemical
reagents leading to the production of nonstoichiometric phases.21−24 As we know, the oxygen components are easily adsorbed on the surface,
and they can significantly change the valence state of vanadium on
the surface of desired vanadium oxides.19,21,25 Thus, a controllable surface is important for modulating
the chemical characteristics and understanding the mechanism of the
metal–insulator transition of VO2 nanostructures.26−29 For example, the oxygen-induced high oxidation state of V on the
surface affects metal–insulator transition.30−33 Unfortunately, the adsorbed oxygen
that is brought by moisture or ambient air is hardly eliminated from
the surface. In addition, the large surface area makes the surface
and phase purity of nanomaterials hard to control. Thus, it is necessary
to understand the adsorption of oxygen on the surface and then make
materials more stable. Some metal oxides (e.g., titanium dioxide)
with good thermal and chemical stability have been demonstrated34−36 and can be used to block the adsorption of oxygen or water on the
surface of functional oxides.37 Furthermore,
atomic layer deposition (ALD) is among surface engineering techniques,
and it is powerful for adjusting surface coating and passivation on
the nanostructures used in optics, microelectronics, and catalysis.38−40

Here, we present the suppression of photoinduced surface oxidation
by blocking oxygen adsorption on VO2 nanoparticles and
nanowires. The ALD-TiO2 coating was used to investigate
the prevention of VO2+x components forming
on the nanostructure surface, which shows better antioxidant capacity,
and it is much more stable and reliable than an inert gas. During
an enhanced oxidation process, intermediate oxidation states were
checked from low valence states to high valence states of V atoms
and nonstoichiometric components. Such oxidation suppression will
help to understand the physical essentials of surface chemical reactions
and then achieve the control of surface functions on correlated vanadium
oxide nanostructures.

Results and Discussion
Before artificial
photoinduced oxidation processes, vanadium dioxide
nanoparticles were prepared by the combination of atomic layer deposition
and annealing processes. Figure 1a shows the initial VO2 nanoparticles with
∼400 nm in lateral size. In general, the VO2 nanoparticles
are crystalline and randomly distributed via annealing an ∼70
nm-thick VOx film (Figure S1) on the silica (∼280 nm)/silicon substrates
according to a previous report.13 In order
to investigate the oxidation evolution of VO2 nanostructures,
photoinduced oxidation is exploited as presented in Figure 1b. In these cases, a laser
was used to irradiate VO2 nanoparticles in a line-scanning
way sweep (Figure S2). Laser power values
and irradiation time can be varied due to different specimens of nanoparticles.
The chemical oxidations were triggered and observed once we artificially
used a laser to irradiate VO2 nanoparticles at an ambient
atmosphere. In Figure 1c, there are obviously different Raman spectra for the VO2 nanoparticles with and without a photoinduced oxidation process.
In the case of the pristine VO2 nanoparticles (spectrum
II), Raman shifts at 193 and 224 cm–1 were observed
due to the characteristic V–V vibration of VO2.
The peak of 520 cm–1 was from the Si substrate.
However, in the case of the irradiated VO2 nanoparticles
(spectrum I), Raman shifts at 103, 144, 283, and 700 cm–1 obviously appeared and are marked with dashed rectangles while the
characteristic Raman peaks of VO2 remained. These emerged
Raman shifts originated from the formation of V2O5 on VO2 nanoparticles during the photoinduced oxidation
processes. Due to the photoinduced catalytic or thermal oxidation
during the laser irradiation, the oxygen adsorbed on the surface of
the VO2 nanostructure directly oxidized the V atoms from
+4 to +5 valence.

deposited on a SiO2/Si substrate. (b) Schematic diagram
of photoinduced oxidation. (c) Raman spectra of VO2 nanoparticles
before and after photoinduced oxidation.

As mentioned above, the photoinduced oxidation processes help us
check the oxidation evolution of VO2 nanostructures. When
an oxidation process was performed, we observed an obvious evolution
as shown in Figure 2. No Raman variation of oxidation was found in Figure 2a because having a low-power value makes
it difficult to trigger a photoinduced oxidation. Then, we noted the
Raman signals of V6O13 that appeared once the
oxidation occurred in a high-power case. In general, the oxygen adsorbed
on the surface will oxidize parts of V atoms on the surface of nanoparticles
under the assistance of a laser. The Raman shifts at ∼96, ∼139,
and ∼685 cm–1 can be found and referred to
V6O13 in Figure 2b.41,42 We also found that the V6O13 is one of the intermediate oxidation states
and not stable under laser irradiation. Here, the characteristic peak
of VO2 was covered due to a high baseline in Raman spectra
with a high laser power. The peak at 103 and 700 cm–1 for V2O5 is obvious, and the Raman shifts
of VO2 retained after photoinduced oxidation as demonstrated
in Figure 2c. This
result indicates that the oxidation reaction involves two subsequent
steps. First, the V6O13 intermediate phase formed
and existed on the surface. As one of the intermediate oxidation states,
the formed V6O13 is not stable under laser irradiation;
thus, V6O13 can be easily and subsequently oxidized
into V2O5 within a short time. We expect that
the oxygen adsorbed on the surface plays a critical role in the photoinduced
oxidation of VO2 nanoparticles. In an ambient environment,
the adsorbed oxygen can oxidize V+4 into V+5 on the surface of the nanoparticles irradiated by a laser. In Figure 2, the schematic diagram
on the right shows the whole oxidation process of VO2 nanoparticles.

spectra and schematic diagrams during the photoinduced oxidation
evolution. (a) Pristine VO2 nanoparticles. (b) VO2 nanoparticles irradiated with an enhanced laser power. (c) VO2 nanoparticles after irradiation.

To further confirm the roles of oxygen molecules adsorbed on the
surface of nanoparticles, we utilized an inert nitrogen atmosphere
to change the adsorption of oxygen during the photoinduced oxidation. Figure 3a shows different
Raman shifts when the VO2 nanoparticles were irradiated
in the air (spectrum I, Figure 3a) and nitrogen atmosphere (spectrum II, Figure 3a). By comparing with the pristine
VO2 nanoparticles (spectrum III, Figure 3a), we did not observe the characteristic
Raman shifts of V2O5 or any difference after
irradiation in a nitrogen atmosphere. If exposed in air, however,
the Raman shifts at ∼145 and ∼700 cm–1 are obvious in contrast to the cases of pristine nanoparticles and
those in nitrogen. This result indicates that the nitrogen intervention
can remove the adsorbed oxygen molecules on the surface and prevent
oxygen molecules from reacting with VO2 under the irradiation
of a laser. In Figure 3b, alternative Raman spectroscopy was further performed when we introduced
nitrogen to protect the specimen and then retracted this protection
during the photoinduced oxidation. From spectrum II′, we did
not observe a Raman shift at ∼103 or ∼700 cm–1 belonging to V2O5. We found that, after removal
of nitrogen, the nanoparticles were still stable and not easily oxidized
in a very short time because the surface had not enough time to readsorb
oxygen molecules. Subsequently, when the specimens were placed in
air for a long time after removal of nitrogen, the oxygen molecules
were readsorbed on the surface, which will lead to obvious surface
oxidation during photoinduced oxidation. The characteristic Raman
signals of V2O5 appear after irradiation as
shown in spectrum II″ (Figure 3c). It means that the specimens can be reoxidized when
being exposed to air for 30 min after removal of nitrogen. This depends
on the fact that the oxygen molecules are easily adsorbed or readsorbed
on the surface of the nanoparticles in air. Except for the continuous
protection under inert gases, the photoinduced oxidation cannot be
suppressed for a long time. Thus, blocking the oxygen adsorption on
the surface is critical to suppress the surface oxidation of VO2 nanoparticles.

without nitrogen protection (I′), and those irradiated after

nanoparticles after several seconds and 30 min in air after removal

The adsorbed oxygen on
the surface determines the oxidation of
VO2 nanoparticles as demonstrated above, and it is one
of the center points for the suppression of surface oxidation to reliably
block the oxygen adsorption. Therefore, we covered VO2 nanoparticles
with ALD-TiO2 thin films to avoid the adsorption of oxygen
on the surface. ALD-TiO2 thin films are powerful for protecting
functional oxides by adjusting the amount of oxygen or water adsorbed
on the surface.37Figure 4 displays the suppression of photoinduced
surface oxidation by the use of ALD-TiO2 thin films with
different thicknesses. The thickness of the TiO2 layer
was controlled by ALD, which can be reconfirmed by TEM and EDS spectra
(e.g., Figures S3 and S4). During the photoinduced
oxidation processes, Raman shifts of V2O5 were
hardly detected in contrast to the case without the ALD-TiO2 thin-film coating. It is worth noting that the oxidation suppression
and protective effect is extremely obvious although only a 5 nm-thick
ALD-TiO2 thin film was coated on the VO2 nanoparticle.
Moreover, The Raman shifts at ∼145 and ∼700 cm–1 were not observed, which implies that the 10 nm-thick ALD-TiO2 thin film (Figure S3) has completely
suppressed the surface oxidation. In addition, with the increase of
the coating thickness of titanium dioxide, the Raman peak at 145 cm–1 is gradually shifted to 140 cm–1, indicating that the thicker the titanium oxides, the better the
protection (Figure S5). These results further
suggest that ALD-TiO2 in nanoscale thickness can prevent
the photoinduced oxidation of VO2 nanoparticles under strong
laser irradiation by blocking the surface adsorption of oxygen.

and schematic outlines of VO2 nanoparticles
protected by coating titanium oxide with different thicknesses after
irradiation.

In order to further understand
the role of the ALD-TiO2 thin film for blocking surface
adsorption of oxygen on VO2 nanostructures, we subsequently
explore the suppression of oxidation
of VO2 nanowires coated with ALD-TiO2 thin films.
According to the above oxidation processes in the cases of VO2 nanoparticles, we can also realize selected-area oxidation
on a VO2 nanowire via a nonlithographic strategy for selected-area
chemical nanoengineering of correlated VO2 nanostructures.13 Once the VO2 nanowires (Figure S6) were irradiated by a laser, the characteristic
Raman peaks of V2O5 such as 103 and 145 cm–1 appeared in Figure 5a. Similar to the cases of nanoparticles, the nanowire
was partly oxidized during photoinduced surface oxidation.13Figure 5b shows that there was no significant difference in the Raman
peak of VO2 nanowires before and after irradiation when
the nanowire was coated with the 10 nm-thick ALD-TiO2 thin
film. As shown in Figure 5a of the line-scanned Raman maps for VO2 nanowires,
Raman shifts at 145 cm–1 obviously appeared in the
case without the protection of the ALD-TiO2 thin film after
irradiation.

Figure 5 Raman spectra and line-scanned Raman maps of the VO2 nanowire during the laser-irradiation processes: (a) no ALD-TiO2 thin film coated on VO2 nanowires and (b) a 10
nm-thick ALD-TiO2 thin film coated on VO2 nanowires.

However, no Raman peaks of V2O5 at 145 cm–1 were detected when the VO2 nanowire was
coated with titanium oxide as shown in Figure 5b. All these results are consistent with
the abovementioned in the cases of VO2 nanoparticles, which
indicates that the photoinduced surface oxidation will be suppressed
by the use of a surface coating for blocking oxygen adsorption on
VO2 nanostructures. Moreover, we noted that the oxidation
procedures were still restrained when the photo-oxidation processes
were performed after several weeks.

Conclusions
We
demonstrated the suppressed photoinduced oxidation through blocking
the adsorption of oxygen on the surface of VO2 nanoparticles
and nanowires. The adsorbed oxygen dominates the oxidation procedures,
and the intermediate oxidation state has been observed. Similar with
an inert atmosphere, the ALD-TiO2 thin films were used
to isolate oxygen adsorbed on the surface for preventing the photoinduced
surface oxidation on VO2 nanostructures. While the essential
mechanism and function details need more exploration, we expected
that such suppression of surface oxidation will help to improve the
stability of vanadium dioxide nanostructures. Controlling surface
oxidation is valuable for understanding the physical essentials of
surface engineering, which enables us to obtain better surface functions
and performances of vanadium oxide nanostructures.

Experimental
Section
VO2 nanoparticles and nanowires were prepared
on the
substrates according to the method previously reported.13 In brief, the SiO2/Si substrates
were cleaned in isopropanol, acetone, ethanol, and deionized water
to remove organic or other impurities and then dried under nitrogen
(N2) gas. In the case of nanoparticles, vanadium(V) oxytriisopropoxide
(VO(OC3H7)3, VTIP) and deionized
water were used as precursors to obtain VOx thin films on the substrate in an ALD reactor (Picosun R100, Finland).
Subsequently, as-prepared VOx thin films
were annealed at 550 °C in argon for 4 h. In the case of nanowires,
V2O5 powder was placed in a quartz boat in a
horizontal quartz tube furnace upstream from the substrates. VO2 nanowires were obtained using a vapor transport method.

The ALD-TiO2 coating was deposited on the VO2 nanostructures in an ALD reactor. In brief, titanium isopropoxide
(Ti[OCH(CH3)2]4,TTIP) and deionized
water were used as precursors. For one cycle of ALD, TTIP was pulsed
and released into the reaction chamber for 1.6 s followed by purging
with nitrogen. Then, deionized water was pulsed for 0.1 s followed
by purging with nitrogen. The thickness of the TiO2 thin
film is controlled by the ALD cycles and checked by transmission electron
microscopy (TEM). The cross-sectional TEM specimens were prepared
by a focused ion beam (FIB) technique after the specimens were sputtered
with a thin platinum layer as protection during the FIB process.

Raman measurements and photoinduced oxidation were conducted using
Nanofinder 30 (TII Tokyo Instruments, Inc.) with an excitation laser
wavelength of 532 nm and a spectral resolution of less than 1 cm–1. In order to acquire the observable Raman signals
and spectrum with a high signal-to-noise ratio, the laser power was
1 mW with different exposure times. During the photo-oxidation processes,
the laser power was up to 10 mW, and the exposure time was up to 5
s. The step was set to 100 nm for the Raman line scanning.
