Single-crystalline
SnSe has attracted much attention because of its record high figure-of-merit ZT ≈ 2.6; however, this high ZT has
been associated with the low mass density of samples which leaves
the intrinsic ZT of fully dense pristine SnSe in
question. To this end, we prepared high-quality fully dense SnSe single
crystals and performed detailed structural, electrical, and thermal
transport measurements over a wide temperature range along the major
crystallographic directions. Our single crystals were fully dense
and of high purity as confirmed via high statistics 119Sn Mössbauer spectroscopy that revealed <0.35 at. % Sn(IV)
in pristine SnSe. The temperature-dependent heat capacity (Cp) provided evidence for the displacive second-order
phase transition from Pnma to Cmcm phase at Tc ≈ 800 K and a small
but finite Sommerfeld coefficient γ0 which implied
the presence of a finite Fermi surface. Interestingly, despite its
strongly temperature-dependent band gap inferred from density functional
theory calculations, SnSe behaves like a low-carrier-concentration
multiband metal below 600 K, above which it exhibits a semiconducting
behavior. Notably, our high-quality single-crystalline SnSe exhibits
a thermoelectric figure-of-merit ZT ∼1.0,
∼0.8, and ∼0.25 at 850 K along the b, c, and a directions, respectively.

1 Introduction
Thermoelectric
(TE) materials enable a green conversion of waste heat to electrical
energy. This conversion efficiency is mainly determined by the dimensionless
figure-of-merit ZT = S2T/ρκ, where ρ, S, T, and, κ are the electrical resistivity,
Seebeck coefficient, absolute temperature, and thermal conductivity,
respectively. In the simplest case, κ = κE +
κL, where κE and κL are the electronic and lattice contributions, respectively, and
the power factor, PF = S2/ρ, is
often defined to measure the electrical performance of the material.
Several effective approaches for enhancing ZT have
been devised, for example, reduced dimensionality,1 high crystal structure complexity,2 band convergence,3 defect engineering,4 anharmonicity,5 and
cagey semiconductors.6 To date, state-of-the-art
TE materials are predominantly semimetals or semiconductors with high
crystal symmetry, small electronegativity difference among constituent
elements, and complex unit cell with the presence of heavy elements
(e.g., Bi, Pb, etc.). In this regard, pristine SnSe
is an outlier among these materials and has been the subject of much
research because of a high ZT ≈ 2.6 that was
reported in early studies by Zhao et al.,7 and a ZT ≈ 1 in subsequent studies.8

Unlike other high-performance TE materials
such as Bi2Te3, CoSb3, PbTe, and
SiGe that have hexagonal or cubic crystal structures, SnSe has a relatively
lower symmetry orthorhombic structure which undergoes a second-order Pnma (#62)-to-Cmcm (#63) displacive phase
transition at Tc ≈ 800 K.9 In addition, although SnSe has a low number of
atoms per unit cell and contains no heavy elements such as Bi and
Pb, it surprisingly exhibits an exceptionally low κL in its pristine form. It is this ultralow κL that
underscores the reported record-high ZT.7 On the one hand, strong anharmonicity has been
confirmed in SnSe, and recent inelastic neutron scattering measurements
combined with first-principle simulations have provided further insights
into the origin of the anharmonicity in SnSe, viz., a coupling of
the lattice distortion below Tc to the
instability of the electronic structure.10,11 On the other hand, it is an open question as to whether strong anharmonicity
alone can account for the observed low κL in ref (7) because it has been argued
in the literature that the SnSe samples therein were of low packing
density (∼88% of the theoretical density).8 Moreover, contrary to our present understanding of phonon
scattering mechanisms in solids, κL of polycrystalline
SnSe12,13 was higher than that reported by Zhao et
al.7 Furthermore, in their study of fully
dense SnSe single crystals, Ibrahim et al.14 reported an electrical transport behavior that is distinct from
the earlier findings of Zhao et al.7 and
Wang et al.,15 which is possibly due to
different growth conditions leading to different hole concentrations.16 In a recent study, Wang et al.17 also reported that the hole-doping mechanism in SnSe and
resulting electron conduction behavior were sensitive to synthesis
parameters that led to two unique defects, namely, the formation of
SnSe2 and/or dislocations, albeit no strong evidence for
these defects was provided in their study. Last, although SnSe is
an intrinsic p-type semiconductor with a band gap ∼0.9–1.0
eV and a low carrier concentration ∼1017 cm–318−20 in the Pnma phase, the high ZT in pristine SnSe is achieved through its high carrier
concentration in the Cmcm phase (∼1019 cm–3).7 The p-type
nature of SnSe has been attributed to native Sn vacancies.21

Theoretical studies of pristine SnSe have
shown the temperature evolution of the Pnma crystal
phase that leads to significant changes in the electronic band structure.18,19 Thus, it is imperative to experimentally investigate the interplay
between a small yet robust Fermi surface as inferred from a finite
Sommerfeld coefficient and the temperature-dependent band gap by means
of electrical and thermal measurements over a wide temperature range.
Here, we report detailed temperature-dependent structural, electronic,
and thermal properties along the three major crystallographic orientations
of fully dense single-crystalline SnSe. A unique aspect of this study
is that in our density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we used
the experimentally determined temperature-dependent structural parameters
to gain a deeper understanding of the fundamental mechanisms at play
in SnSe and to describe their behavior over a wide range of temperatures
(10–900 K). We conclude that fully dense pristine single-crystalline
SnSe, with <0.35 at. % Sn(IV) as revealed by high precision 119Sn Mössbauer spectroscopy, exhibits a ZT ≈ 0.8–1 above ∼800 K.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Structural Properties
Two representative SnSe single crystals grown by the Bridgman method
are shown in Figure 1A. The crystals could be cleaved easily along the a direction (because of the weak van der Waals bonds), yielding atomically
flat surfaces that exhibit a metallic luster.22 The room-temperature density of SnSe crystals as determined from
the Archimedes method (6.16 ± 0.01 g cm–3)
and gas pycnometry (6.15 ± 0.06 g cm–3) on
both as-grown ingot and cut pieces was consistent with the density
estimated from our synchrotron X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements
(∼6.14 g cm–3) which is ∼100% of the
theoretical density. Figure 1B shows the neutron rocking curve of a 19 g SnSe crystal at
2θ = 48.46°. The full width at half-maximum (fwhm) is estimated
to be 0.48(1)°, revealing the excellent quality of monocrystalline
SnSe from the Bridgman method. The XRD pattern of our SnSe crystal
revealed four distinct (111) peaks and is shown in Figure 1C. From the XRD phi-scan, the
in-plane orientation of SnSe single crystals can be explicitly identified,
for example, the angles between two adjacent (111) peaks were found
to be 86.13° and 93.87° (Figure 1C,D), in good agreement with previous neutron
scattering results.9 It is well known that
the Sn–Se atomic layers are corrugated (because of the zigzagged
Sn–Se atomic chains along the c direction
as shown in the inset figure of Figure 1E), and hence, the topography of the scanning tunneling
spectrometer (STM) image of the (100) surface in Figure 1E collected at 5 K reveals
only the top Sn layer of the crystal, which is defect-free. Figure 1F shows a representative
differential-conductance, dI/dV spectrum
for SnSe, which represents the density of state (DOS) as a function
of energy. Clearly, the valence band maximum (VBM) is close to the
Fermi level (EF = 0), leading to the p-type
nature of SnSe, and the band gap is estimated to be ∼1.15 eV
at ∼5 K.

respectively.

2.2 Mössbauer
Spectroscopy
A detailed 119Sn Mössbauer
spectral study was performed on a single-crystalline SnSe sample (Figure 2) to confirm their
stoichiometry and high crystalline quality. No measurable amount of
oxidation or SnO2, which would appear as a signal at 0
mm/s, was observed. A very small minority component which is other
than SnSe [∼0.35(5) at. % Sn(IV) in SnSe] is observed in the
spectrum and was modeled with the spectral parameters of SnSe2 (an isomer shift of 1.3 mm/s, a quadrupole splitting of 0
mm/s, and a linewidth of 0.9 mm/s).23 The
impurity phase could also be attributed to defective local coordination
that yields an isomer shift similar to Sn(IV) in chalcogenide coordination.
The main phase Mössbauer spectrum is an asymmetric doublet,
which is also observed in powders24 but
is more pronounced here because of the anisotropy of the single-crystalline
layers. An initial fit (with a simple doublet) yields the spectral
parameters for the majority phase corresponding to SnSe.23,25 The isomer shift is 3.34(1) mm/s, and the quadrupole splitting is
0.732(5) mm/s, with a linewidth of 0.73(2) mm/s. This sum of square
residuals (SSR) for this fit is 296.0(0.1) for 256 data points and
7 fit parameters, (χred.2 = 1.19). The
doublet asymmetry is given by a 36:64 ratio of intensity between the
left and right lines, for SnSe. The difference plot with the initial
fit, in magenta, top of Figure 2 indicates the presence of a small residual component around
0.9 mm/s. Hence, a broadened line corresponding to SnSe2 was included in the final fit. The difference plot with the final
fit, in blue, top of Figure 2 indicates no further residual components, implying that the
two-component fit suffices [SSR = 278.0(0.1), k =
8 parameters, N = 256 data points, χred.2 = 1.12]. Figure 2 shows the data and the two-component fit for SnSe. The difference
plot at the top is magnified by a factor 10 and the ±1σ
deviation is depicted by gray lines. The inset to the figure enlarges
the velocity range where the secondary doublet is observed. The majority
SnSe phase component is displayed in magenta, the minority doublet
is displayed in blue and the total fit is displayed in black. Note
that to quantify the minority phase, we have taken into account the
temperature dependence of the Lamb–Mössbauer factor
for Sn in SnSe and SnSe2 as calculated from the partial
density of Sn phonon states obtained experimentally11 and theoretically,26 respectively.

displayed in blue amounts to 0.35 at. %. The SnSe doublet is displayed
in magenta. Data points for data are scaled to match the error bar.

2.3 Temperature-Dependent
Synchrotron XRD and Heat Capacity
Figure 3A shows the temperature-dependent evolution
of synchrotron XRD patterns of SnSe powder. It is evident that several
peaks split into two near the phase transition temperature (800 K,
from Cmcm to Pnma). The temperature-dependent
lattice parameters obtained from XRD and neutron diffraction measurements
are shown in Figure 3B. With increasing temperature, the two shorter lattice parameters
(along b and c directions) in the Pnma phase approach each other and become nearly equal in
the Cmcm phase, whereas the lattice parameter along
the a direction increases monotonically. All the
three lattice parameters evolve continuously across Tc to a higher symmetry Cmcm phase. Interestingly,
the lattice parameter along the c direction decreases
with the increasing temperature, indicative of a negative thermal
expansion due to a strong coupling to the anharmonic phonon modes.11 To further elucidate this anharmonicity, the Cp of a fully dense SnSe crystal was measured
from 0.45 to 875 K (Figure 3C). In addition to the continuity of unit cell volume at 800
K (inset in Figure 3C), the characteristic lambda-shaped Cp peak at Tc ≈ 800 K is a signature
of a second-order phase transition,27 the
shape of which was retained through several temperature cycles. In
the temperature range from 300 K to Tc, the measured Cp is higher than the
Dulong–Petit limit ∼49.9 J mol–1 K–1, signifying a strong anharmonicity at T < Tc, prior to the onset of the lambda
transition near Tc. In contrast, the Cp attains the Dulong–Petit limit above Tc. As shown in the inset in Figure 3C, the volume expansion largely
retains the same positive temperature coefficient above Tc, indicating the presence of anharmonicity above Tc that is largely offset by the phonon softening
in the Cmcm phase.

patterns and heat capacity data of SnSe. (A) Temperature-dependent
XRD patterns showing the peak evolution with temperature. (B) Lattice
parameters determined from Rietveld refinement and plotted as a function
of temperature along a, b, and c directions. (C) Cp as a function
of temperature below and above Tc (vertical
blue dashed line). Inset: unit cell volume plotted as a function of
temperature. (D) Estimated Debye temperature (ΘD)
from the plot of Cp/T vs T2.

From a linear plot of Cp/T versus T2 in the low temperature
regime (0.45–1 K), a Debye temperature ΘD ≈
206 K was estimated using the relation Cp(T) = γ0T + β T3 where a Sommerfeld coefficient γ0 ≈ (6.0 ± 0.7) × 10–5 J
mol–1 K–2 and the lattice contribution
to heat capacity β ≈ 4.4 × 10–4 J mol–1 K–4 were obtained (Figure 3D). The γ0 value of SnSe is comparable to that of Bi (∼4–8
× 10–5 J mol–1 K–2),28 and an order of magnitude lower than
that of copper (γCu = 6.95 × 10–4 J mol–1 K–2), implying a low
DOS (EF) and a small Fermi surface. This
small but robust Fermi surface in SnSe could arise from the presence
of native defects, mainly Sn vacancies in this case, which are easy
to form.29

2.4 Temperature-Dependent
Band Structure and Electronic Transport
Figure 4A,C shows the SnSe band structure
(DFT + GW0) that was calculated using our experimental
lattice parameters (Figure 3B) at selected temperatures in the Pnma phase
(T = 65, 300, 424, 515, 607, 703, and 752 K) and
the Cmcm phase (T = 799, 888, and
970 K), respectively. In the Pnma phase, the highest
VB peak appears in the Γ–Z direction
(VB2), parallel to the c direction (shown on an expanded
scale in Figure 4B).
As the temperature decreases from 752 K, this peak splits into two
(“pudding mold bands” which lead to a large Seebeck
coefficient)30 with the left peak moving
toward the EF with decreasing temperature.
Incidentally, the unique pudding mold-shaped VB was reported through
high-resolution ARPES measurements that revealed two ellipsoid hole
pockets along the Γ–Z direction close
to EF, in good agreement with the metallic
transport of these samples.17 The second
VB peak (VB1) (shown on an expanded scale in Figure 4B), which is parabolic and along the Γ–Y direction, moves toward EF with increasing temperature. It is worth noting that these two VB
peaks shift in an opposite manner with temperature relative to EF, which influence the carrier concentration
of SnSe. In contrast to VB, the conduction band minimum (CBM) in the
Γ–Y direction (CB1) moves away from
the EF with increasing temperature and
becomes closer in energy to the broad CBM at Γ point (CB2),
which causes a band convergence above 600 K that enhances the S and/or PF of SnSe.3 It is expected
that these temperature-induced shifts of CBM and VBM will influence
the electrical transport properties of SnSe. On the other hand, a
direct energy band gap along the P–Z direction is found for SnSe in the Cmcm phase (Figure 4C).
Generally, the energy band gap of a semiconductor decreases with increasing
temperature according to the semiempirical Varshni relation,31 we find that the calculated band gap of SnSe
is valley-dependent in both the Pnma and Cmcm phases and increases monotonically with increasing
temperature (Figure 4D).

transition, (B) expanded view of the VBM and CBM indicated in the
dotted squares in (A). (D) Estimated energy band gap above and below
the phase transition temperature.

The temperature-dependent electrical resistivity (ρ
= 1/σ) of SnSe single crystals along the three major crystallographic
directions are shown in Figure 5A. The ρ values are similar in magnitude along the in-plane b and c directions but higher along the
perpendicular a direction. Moreover, ρ exhibits
an upturn with decreasing temperature below 50 K, which is most pronounced
along the a direction that has also been observed
by Wang et al.17 and attributed to weak
localization. In the 50–600 K temperature range, ρ increases
with increasing temperature which can be attributed to the contraction
of the VB2 (Figure 4B) that reduces the Fermi surface. The contraction of VB2 also counterbalances
the thermal excitation effect that makes the effective carrier concentration
become almost temperature-independent for T >
50 K (inset in Figure 5B). Above 600 K, ρ decreases by more than an order of magnitude
because of the quick upshift of the VB1 with increasing temperature
that greatly enlarges the Fermi surface. In other words, ρ of Pnma phase is governed by the temperature-dependent shift
and curvature variations of both VB1 and VB2 (Figure 4B).

resistivity (ρ) of SnSe as a function of temperature. (B) Carrier
mobility (μ = RH/ρ), and 1/eRH shown in the inset figure as a function of
temperature. (C) Seebeck coefficient (S) and (D)
TE power factor (PF = S2/ρ) of SnSe
as a function of temperature.

To gain more insights into the underlying mechanisms, we
also measured the Hall coefficient RH along
all three crystallographic directions in the 2–300 K range
(inset of Figure 5B).
In an agreement with previous study7 and
our temperature-dependent band structure calculations (Figure 4), the Arrhenius thermal excitation
behavior (which refers to thermal activation of carriers over a band
gap) was not observed in the 2–300 K range. Moreover, the measured
Hall coefficients exhibited anisotropy, which is consistent with the
anisotropic and multiband nature of the band structure. Between 70
and 300 K, a weak temperature dependence was observed in 1/eRH along all three directions with a value of
1/eRH ≈ 6–7 × 1017 cm–3 along the b and c directions, and a 1/eRH ≈
5–6 × 1017 cm–3 along the a direction. The temperature-dependent 1/eRH below 50 K exhibits two dissimilar trends with decreasing
temperature along the three crystallographic directions. The decrease
in 1/eRH value with decreasing temperature
along the a direction is the reason for the slight
resistivity upturn along the a direction discussed
in Figure 5A. Such
complex and anisotropic temperature-dependent behavior along the a direction can be attributed to the weak localization effect.17

The Hall mobility μ (=RH/ρ) as a function of temperature between 2 and
300 K is shown in Figure 5B. In general, μ exhibits a peak at 50 K and similar
temperature dependence along all three crystallographic directions
above 50 K, which is indicative of a dominant electron–phonon
coupling. The μ values at 50 K (300 K) are 396 (52), 1065 (116),
and 602 (118) cm2 V–1 s–1 along the a, b, and c directions, respectively. Moreover, strong anisotropy is observed
in μ below 50 K, which crossed over to a noisy plateau at ∼400
cm2 V–1 s–1 along a direction and decreased steeply with a decreasing temperature
along the b and c directions. As
shown in Figure 5C,
the Seebeck coefficient S of SnSe is positive throughout
the entire temperature range, indicative of dominant hole conduction.
Along the three crystallographic directions, the S increases with increasing temperature from ∼15 K until the
maximum value of ∼540–600 μV K–1 is reached in the vicinity of 600 K. There is no discernible anomaly
near 50 K, in contrast to the observed temperature dependence of ρ
(cf. Figure 5A) and
μ (cf. Figure 5B). We employed the Goldsmid–Sharp relation to estimate the
energy band gap Eg = 2eSmaxTSmax,32 where Smax is the peak value
of S and TSmax is the
corresponding temperature. The estimated Eg values are found to be in the range 0.62–0.72 eV, consistent
with the calculated band gap at 600 K (cf. Figure 4D). The temperature dependence of S is anisotropic, reflecting the anisotropy of the Fermi
surface topology of SnSe (Figure 4A–C). Apparently, this anisotropy becomes stronger
with decreasing temperature, which is consistent with the observed
variations in 1/eRH (cf. the inset of Figure 5B). Furthermore, S is observed to increase gradually with increasing temperature
in the Cmcm phase, contrary to the expectation that S should decrease above the phase transition temperature.19 There are several factors that could affect
the thermopower and resistivity simultaneously in a multivalley material
system such as SnSe, including effective mass of band valleys, inter-/intra-valley
scattering and band gap that needs further investigation.

The
temperature-dependent PF (=S2/ρ)
of our single-crystalline SnSe along the three major crystallographic
directions from ∼15–900 K is shown in Figure 5D. At ∼600 K, the PF
shows a local minimum because of the high ρ. At T ≈ 850 K, the higher symmetry Cmcm phase
exhibited a maximum PF ≈ 0.8 mW m–1 K–2 along the b and c directions, while a much lower PF ≈ 0.2 mW m–1 K–2 was obtained along the a direction.
These PF values are comparable to the values (∼0.8–1.0
mW m–1 K–2) reported in ref (7) along the b and c directions, but not in agreement with the
PF values reported in ref (14).

2.5 Thermal Transport and ZT of Fully Dense SnSe
The total thermal conductivity
κ of our single-crystalline SnSe in the temperature range from
25–930 K is shown in Figure 6A. The solid (open) symbols are values obtained using
steady-state (transient laser flash) technique for rod (disc) shaped
pieces cut along specific crystallographic directions. Owing to the
predominantly high ρ ≈ 0.1–0.8 Ω cm in the
25–930 K temperature range (Figure 5A), it is evident that κ ≈ κL. As shown in the inset of Figure 6A, well-defined Umklapp peaks are observed
at ∼30 K (i.e., ∼1/7 of ΘD) along the b and c directions but are absent along
the a direction. The κL of the Pnma phase is inversely proportional to temperature above
30 K, indicating that the Umklapp process is dominant with increasing
temperature. The absence of the Umklapp peak along the a direction is presumably due to the downshift of this peak to a lower
temperature as the Brillouin zone is substantially shorter along the a (a*) direction. It is well known that
the presence of defects will lower the Umklapp peak intensity and
concomitantly broaden it. Ibrahim et al.14 and Wang et al.15 have reported a stronger
Umklapp peak in their studies, implying that the Umklapp peak in this
study may arise because of the presence of <0.35 at. % Sn(IV).
Of particular note are the room-temperature values of κ along
the b and c directions (2.16 and
1.62 W m–1 K–1, respectively),
which are comparable to the corresponding values reported by Wasscher
et al.33 (κ ≈ 1.9 W m–1 K–1 in the bc-plane)
and Ibrahim et al.14 as well as the theoretical
results by Carrete et al.34 Compared with
the Pnma phase of SnSe, the κ of the Cmcm phase is ∼0.7–0.9 W m–1 K–1 along b and c directions and ∼0.3–0.4 W m–1 K–1 along a direction. The figure-of-merit, ZT of our single-crystalline SnSe in the temperature range
25–900 K is shown in Figure 6B. It is noteworthy that the ZT peaks
are present at 850 K in the Cmcm phase, which is
∼50 K above Tc. Because of the
uncertainty of determining Cp value at Tc, and subsequently κ, the plot in Figure 6B does not include ZT data points around Tc. Despite
obtaining similar PF values to that reported in ref (7), we obtained peak ZT values of ∼1.0, ∼0.8, and ∼0.25
along the b, c, and a directions at 850 K, respectively. Clearly, the ZT values are a factor of two lower than that of ∼2.6 reported
in ref (7), a discrepancy
that has been discussed in our previous publication.8

flash techniques, respectively.

3 Conclusion
Our detailed temperature-dependent
structural, electrical, and thermal transport on high-quality single-crystalline
SnSe indicate a low-carrier-concentration multiband feature below
600 K, above which a semiconducting behavior is exhibited. The small
but robust Fermi surface in SnSe could arise from the presence of
Sn vacancies, which are the dominant intrinsic defects in SnSe. Nonetheless,
extensive Mössbauer spectroscopy verify the high quality of
our SnSe crystals and found that the defect concentration is <0.35
at. % Sn(IV).

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Synthesis and Characterization
High-purity Sn chunks
(99.999%) and Se shots (99.999%) were weighed in the stoichiometric
ratio of SnSe, sealed in evacuated silica tubes, and heated at 1223
K for 48 h followed by furnace-cooling to room temperature. The obtained
ingots were crushed and sealed in double silica tubes as it is well
known that the volume expansion of the SnSe lattice (along b axis) near the phase transition temperature could break
the inner silica tube, causing SnSe to oxidize. The SnSe single crystals
were grown using the vertical Bridgman method with a growth rate of
1.5 mm h–1 at 1223 K. Finally, high-quality SnSe
single crystals (Figure 1A, weight ∼50 g, diam ≈ 13 mm) were obtained with a
packing density which is >99% of the theoretical density, as discussed
in the next section. The absence of the SnO2 phase in our
SnSe single crystals was confirmed by Raman and Mössbauer spectroscopy.
Furthermore, the pole figure and orientation were determined by a
PANalytical X’Pert PRO MRD high-resolution X-ray diffractometer.
A Rigaku TTRAX 3 X-ray diffractometer (λ = 1.54056 Å, from
65–300 K) and the synchrotron X-ray beamline BL01C2 (λ
= 0.619925 Å, from 300–1014 K, at the National Synchrotron
Radiation Research Center, Taiwan) were employed in conjunction with
the General Structure Analysis System (GSAS) program to characterize
our SnSe single crystals.35 The neutron
rocking curve measurements were conducted on BT-7 triple-axis spectrometers
at the NIST Center for Neutron Research using pyrolytic graphite PG(002)
monochromator crystals to select an incident wavelength of λ
= 2.359 A°, with a PG filter to suppress higher-order wavelength
contaminations. Single-detector measurements were made with a PG(002)
energy analyzer.

The electrical resistivity ρ and Seebeck coefficient S were measured using the ULVAC ZEM-3 system in the temperature
range of 300–900 K. The low temperature (10–300 K) resistivity
and Seebeck coefficient were measured simultaneously using a custom-designed
measurement system.36 The Hall coefficient RH and the isobaric heat capacity Cp were measured using a commercial Quantum Design Physical
Properties Measurement System in the temperature range of 2–300
K while a 3He cryostat was used to measure Cp between 0.45 and 2 K. The Hall mobility μ was
calculated using the relation, μ = RH/ρ in the context of the Drude model. The total thermal conductivity
κ in the temperature range of 15–300 K was measured using
a custom-designed steady-state technique.37 The thermal conductivity at low temperatures was corrected for radiation
losses above 200 K, using the Stefan–Boltzmann power law.37 Above room temperature, the total thermal conductivity
was estimated as κ = DTCvd, where the thermal diffusivity DT was measured by the laser flash method using
Netzsch LFA457, Cp was measured using
Netzsch Pegasus 404 high-temperature differential scanning calorimetry
system, and the packing density d of the crystal
was measured at room temperature by the Archimedes method and gas
pycnometry (Micromeritics AccuPyc 1330). For a strongly anharmonic
material such as SnSe, Cp > Cv at elevated temperatures but the discrepancy
between Cp and Cv is offset to the first order by a decrease in the packing
density because of thermal expansion. Hence, Cp ≈ Cv except at Tc. As described above, the low- and high-temperature
thermal conductivity values are measured using different principles,
sample geometries, and measurement environments. These techniques
offer an opportunity to probe the presence of cracks in the SnSe single
crystals. During the laser flash measurement, the cracks may leak
the laser signal and yield an artificially high thermal diffusivity
value, however, if the same cracks were present under a dynamic vacuum,
no heat could conduct through the cracks during the low temperature
steady-state measurements. Thus one would expect to see a mismatch
between the results of low- and high-temperature measurements in the
presence of cracks. As shown in Figure 6A, the low- and high-temperature measurements match
exceedingly well; thus, the presence of cracks can be excluded in
our SnSe single crystals. The surface topography of in situ cleaved
single-crystalline SnSe was collected using an etched tungsten wire
in a custom-designed 3He STM.38

Room-temperature 119Sn Mössbauer spectra
were obtained in transmission geometry using a MS-96 constant acceleration
drive (Palacky University, Olomouc) with a 10 mCi Ca119mSnO3 source. The spectrometer was calibrated using α-iron
foil with a 1 mCi 57Co source in rhodium matrix. The SnSe
sample was prepared by mechanically exfoliating the crystals on aluminized
Mylar tape, wherein two layers were used for the SnSe samples. The
radiation was parallel to the crystallographic a axis.
The isomer shift is reported relative to SnO2 at ambient
temperature. The total collected statistics for the sample was 24
× 106 counts per channel, after binning to a total
of 256 channels, collected for 5 days, for SnSe. The signal-to-noise
ratio was about the same for both samples as the latter samples had
twice the thickness and absorption. An appropriate statistics estimator
for a fit of one data set by two models with different number of parameters
is given by the Akaike Information Criterion,39,40 which yields relative likelihood for the 1 component model of exp((AIC1 – AIC2)/2) < 0.001, where AIC = 2 × k + N ln(SSR/N).
