Nitazoxanide
has antiparasitic and antibiotic activities including
activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis. We prepared and evaluated a set of its analogues to determine the
structure–activity relationship, and identified several amide-
and urea-based analogues with low micromolar activity against M. tuberculosis in vitro. Pharmacokinetics in the
rat suggested a path forward to obtain bioavailable compounds. The
series had a good microbiological profile with bactericidal activity
in vitro against replicating and nonreplicating M.
tuberculosis. Analogues had limited activity against
other Gram-positive bacteria but no activity against Gram-negative
bacteria. Our studies identified the key liability in this series
as cytotoxicity. Future work concentrating on identifying the target(s)
could assist in removing activity against eukaryotic cells.

Introduction
Tuberculosis (TB) is an infectious disease
that continues to be
a global health problem despite the availability of an effective chemotherapy.
According to the World Health Organization Global TB Report for 2015,
there were an estimated 10.4 million new cases of TB disease, 1.4
million deaths were reported, and an additional 0.4 million deaths
resulting from HIV-positive individuals.1 Under the directly observed treatment short course strategy, the
globally recommended chemotherapy for the treatment of drug-susceptible
tuberculosis involves administration of four drugs (rifampicin, isoniazid,
pyrazinamide, and ethambutol) for the first 2 months followed by 4
months of rifampicin and isoniazid treatment. The major challenges
facing TB treatment include this long duration of therapy, the emergence
of drug resistance to current antibiotics, and complications with
HIV co-infection. A third of the world’s population has latent
TB infection with no symptoms and a lifetime risk of disease development,
especially in immunocompromised conditions.2 Because of these challenges, there is a need to improve TB treatment
through the discovery and development of new and more effective drugs.
This process is time-consuming, expensive, and requires good leads.

A drug discovery strategy based on identifying new uses for approved
drugs (drug repurposing) can lead to a reduced timeframe, lower cost,
and increased success rate of drug development. For instance, Miltefosine,
which is a phospholipid drug originally developed as an anti-cancer
agent, was subsequently found to be effective and safe in the treatment
of visceral leishmaniasis.3,4 Alternatively, lead
optimization from existing drugs to remove liabilities, or to improve
potency for new indications, can be a more rapid route to obtaining
drug candidates.

The anti-protozoan drug Nitazoxanide (NTZ, 1) may
have potential for repurposing against tuberculosis. It is approved
by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treatment of parasitic
diseases such as cryptosporidiosis, and it exhibits antibacterial
activity.5,6 In bacteria such as Helicobacter
pylori, 1 inhibits pyruvate-ferrodoxin
oxidoreductase, but its mode of action in Caenorhabditis
elegans may involve disruption of a chloride ion channel.7,8 In M. tuberculosis, it disrupts the
membrane potential, interferes with the pH homeostasis machinery,9 and may have other modes of action. Given this
polypharmacological anti-tubercular activity and the fact that it
is an approved drug likely optimized for physicochemical and pharmacokinetic
properties with a good safety profile,10,111 is an attractive starting point for structure–activity relationship
(SAR) studies to explore its anti-tubercular activity.

Given
the encouraging anti-tubercular reports on 1, we embarked
on SAR and structure–property relationship (SPR)
studies to identify activity- and property-optimized analogues of 1 for characterization of mechanism of activity and progression
for development into anti-tuberculosis therapeutics.

Results and Discussion
We used 1 as a lead compound to conduct a systematic
structure–activity relationship study of its anti-tubercular
activity. Its analogues were designed to explore activity requirements
for the salicylate, amide linkage, and nitrothiazole segments. A total
of 56 compounds were synthesized and evaluated. The majority of the
compounds were synthesized by standard amide bond coupling of two
fragments.

Chemistry
Compounds 1–30, 32–36, and 40–53, which represent direct amide analogues of 1, were prepared using standard amide bond formation protocols by
reaction of an aminothiazole with a corresponding acid or activated
acid derivative. The sulfonamide derivative 54 was similarly
obtained from the reaction of aminothiazole with a sulfonyl chloride.
Urea analogues 31 and 37–39 were prepared by a reaction between an aminothiazole and a corresponding
isocyanate under standard reaction conditions. The amine analogues 55 and 56 were prepared by reductive alkylation
of an aminothiazole with an aldehyde. The synthesis is outlined in Figure 1.

SAR Studies and Biological Activity
We designed, synthesized,
and evaluated various analogues to probe the SAR of the salicylate
region of 1. Compounds were tested for activity against M. tuberculosis and for cytotoxicity against the
Vero cell line (Tables 1 and 2). 1 itself had a modest activity against
replicating M. tuberculosis grown aerobically,
with a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 14 μM. The
tizoxanide (2) and glucuronidated (3) derivatives
were not active. Starting with a deconstructive approach, the removal
(4) or replacement of the phenolic acetate in 1 with various amines (5, 6), a simple amide
(7), methyl ether (17), or a carboxylic
acid (16) resulted in analogues with no activity. Analogues
incorporating more a lipophilic ester (8), amide (9, 18), or carbamate (10) showed
activity, with both compounds 8 and 18 showing
a 10-fold improvement in activity. The activity was, however, accompanied
by an increase in cytotoxicity, resulting in a low selectivity index.
Analogues bearing various ring substitutions on the phenolic region,
such as 5-fluoro (11), 5-methyl (12), 3-methyl
(13), 4-(N-morphonlinyl) (14), or 5-hydroxy (15), also showed no activity. A transition
to 2-pyridyl analogues exemplified by 19 also resulted
in improved activity and an improved separation from cytotoxicity
(SI of approximately 8). Various substitutions on the 2-pyridyl unit
gave analogues with modest activity, but these were also cytotoxic
(20–23). The 3-methoxy (24) and 5-(N-morpholinyl) (25) analogues
were inactive.

Replacement
of the phenol with representative aliphatic residues
like methyl (26), cyclopropyl (27), cyclohexyl
(28), or 2-hydroxycyclohexyl (30) resulted
in loss of activity. Other heteroaromatic replacements (30–35 and 40–44) tested were also inactive. We also prepared and tested 1-naphthyl
(36), cyclohexyl (38), and 2-pyridyl (39) urea analogues. All were inactive, although the phenylurea
(37) had a comparable activity to the parent compound 1.

We also explored the thiazole region of 1 for SAR
information (Table 3). Removal of the nitro group at C-5 (45) eliminated
all activity. Methylation of C-4 of the thiazole (46)
or replacement of the nitro group with a charged methyl ester (47) resulted in inactive compounds. Similar analogues on a
2-pyridyl amide template showed some activity, but the activity was
accompanied with cytotoxicity (49, 50, and 53), whereas others (48, 51, and 52) were inactive altogether.

compounds.

Pharmacokinetic Profiling of Analogues
NTZ is rapidly
metabolized in rats and is not detectable in plasma or urine.12 We wanted to determine if our analogues had
improved pharmacokinetics. We evaluated four representative compounds
for their pharmacokinetic properties in rats (Table 5). The volume of distribution (Vd) was low for all compounds. Plasma clearance (Cl) approached
rat hepatic blood flow (Qh) for two compounds, with low oral exposures
(low bioavailability) suggesting that first pass metabolism was significant
(Table 5). However,
plasma clearance (Cl) was low for 2 compounds, translating into good
bioavailability.

Analogues of 1 Have Limited Broad Spectrum Activity
We determined
the spectrum of activity for the analogues against
several bacterial species. Three active and structurally diverse analogues
(8, 19, and 37) were tested
against Mycobacterium smegmatis, two
Gram-negative species (Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa), two
Gram-positive species (Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus subtilus), and the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Table 6). The Gram-positive bacteria showed some
susceptibility, with B. subtilis being
sensitive to all three compounds, whereas M. smegmatis, S. cerevisiae, and S. aureus were sensitive to one compound (19 or 37, respectively). The Gram-negative bacteria were
not susceptible to any of the analogues.

Analogues of 1 Have Bactericidal
Activity against M. tuberculosis
Previous work had demonstrated
that 1 itself had good activity against nonreplicating
or persistent M. tuberculosis.(13) We wanted to determine if our analogues retained
bactericidal activity. Kill kinetics for compounds 19 and 37 were determined against replicating M. tuberculosis (Figure 2). As seen with 1, compound 37 showed bactericidal activity (at least 3 logs kill
in 21 days) at concentrations equivalent to the MIC. Compound 19 was also bactericidal, but only at concentrations at or
higher than 5 times the MIC. Compound 8 was also rapidly
bactericidal, resulting in a >4 log kill in 7 days at 10×
MIC.

Figure 2 Analogues of 1 have bactericidal activity under aerobic
conditions.

Compounds 19 and 37 were also tested
for the ability to kill M. tuberculosis under nonreplicating conditions induced by nutrient starvation.14 Compounds 19 and 37 demonstrated bactericidal activity under this condition as well,
even at concentrations as low as 1.25× MIC, confirming that these
compounds were more active against nonreplicating bacteria (Figure 3).

Figure 3 Analogues of 1 have bactericidal
activity under nonreplicating
conditions.

Conclusions
We
conducted an SAR assessment of three segments of 1, namely,
the salicylate, the nitrothiazole, and the amide linker.
The salicylate and the linker regions can accommodate modifications,
but the nitrothiazole region was very sensitive to change. For example,
we were unable to identify a nitro-group replacement that retained
activity, except in combination with a change to the 2-pyridyl amide
template.

The results of our studies demonstrate that even though
the series
suffers from a steep selectivity barrier with some level of SAR trending
with cytotoxicity, a proper manipulation of the structure could lead
to promising anti-tuberculosis agents. Nitazoxanide is essentially
a prodrug antiparasitic and antiviral agent that is metabolized in
humans to an active metabolite, Tizoxanide. We were able to make more
stable amide analogues of 1 with retained or better activity,
which enabled expanded SAR exploration.

1 is active
against parasites but is generally not
active against aerobic bacteria.5 Similarly,
all of its analogues tested in this study were either inactive or
weakly active against bacterial species, with the exception of B. subtilus. On the other hand, the analogues tested
in this study were bactericidal against M. tuberculosis under both replicating and nonreplicating conditions, which is consistent
with what has previously been published.13 Further studies focused on understanding the mechanisms of action
of this compound class in multiple organisms could shed light on why 1 and its analogues are active against parasites and M. tuberculosis but not against many other bacteria.
It is worth noting that the compound class of thiazolides has been
reported as active against a wide variety of helminth, protozoan parasites,
anaerobic bacteria, and viruses.15 In the
SAR for these activities, the nitro group is a prerequisite for efficient
activity against extracellular but not intracellular parasites.16,17

Materials and Methods
Determination of Minimum Inhibitory Concentration
MICs
were determined against M. tuberculosis H37Rv (London Pride)18 grown in Middlebrook
7H9 medium containing 10% v/v OADC (oleic acid, albumin, dextrose,
catalase) supplement (Becton Dickinson) and 0.05% w/v Tween 80 (7H9-Tw-OADC)
under aerobic conditions as previously described.19 Bacterial growth was measured after 5 days of incubation
at 37 °C. The MIC was defined as the minimum concentration at
which growth was completely inhibited, and was calculated from the
inflection point of the fitted curve to the lower asymptote (zero
growth).

Cytotoxicity Assay
The Vero cell line (ATCC CRL-1587)
was grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium, high
glucose, GlutaMAX (Invitrogen), 10% fetal bovine serum, and 1×
penicillin–streptomycin solution (100 U/mL). Compounds were
solubilized in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and assayed as a 10-point
three-fold serial dilution. Compounds were incubated with cells for
2 days at 37 °C, 5% CO2. CellTiter-Glo Reagent (Promega)
was added, and the relative luminescent units were measured. Inhibition
curves were fitted using the Levenberg–Marquardt algorithm;
TC50 was calculated as the compound concentration giving
50% inhibition of growth. Note that compounds 1 and 2 were tested at a maximum concentration of 20 μM, all
other compounds were tested at a maximum concentration of 50 μM.

Kill Kinetics in Replicating Conditions
A late log
phase culture of M. tuberculosis was
adjusted to an OD590 of 0.1 in 7H9-Tw-OADC, and 50 μL
was used to inoculate 5 mL of 7H9-Tw-OADC containing compounds at
indicated concentrations with a final DMSO concentration of 2%. Cultures
were incubated standing at 37 °C, and serial dilutions were plated
to determine colony forming units (CFUs) on Middlebrook 7H10 agar
plus 10% v/v OADC supplement. Plates were incubated for 4 weeks, and
colonies were counted.

Kill Kinetics under Starvation
Late
log phase bacterial
cultures were grown in 7H9-Tw-OADC, harvested, and resuspended at
an OD590 of 0.1 in PBS + 0.05% w/v tyloxapol. Cultures
were incubated at 37 °C for 14 days before the compound was added
at indicated concentrations (final DMSO concentration of 2%). Cultures
were incubated standing at 37 °C, and CFUs were determined by
serial dilution and plating.

Spectrum
MICs were determined using
the serial dilution
agar method. S. aureus RN4220 and E. coli DH5α were grown on LB agar, M. smegmatis mc2155 was grown on Middlebrook
7H10 agar plates plus 10% v/v OADC supplement, P. aeruginosa BAA 47 PA0 was cultured on Tryptic Soy Agar plates, B. subtilis Marburg was cultured on nutrient agar
plates, and S. cerevisiaeY187 was cultured on YPD agar plates. In each case, 105 CFU/mL
of late log phase culture was plated and incubated at 37 °C until
large colonies formed on the no compound control plates. The lowest
concentration of compound that had less than 1% growth was reported
as the MIC99.

Compound Synthesis
1H

NMR spectral data were recorded in CDCl3 or DMSO-d6 on a 300 or 400 MHz Bruker NMR spectrometer.
Column chromatography was conducted on a Revelaris flash chromatography
system. Reactions were monitored using thin-layer chromatography (TLC)
on silica gel plates. HPLC analysis was conducted on an Agilent 1100
series LC system (Agilent ChemStation Rev.A.10.02; Phenomenex-Luna-C18,
4.8 mm × 150 mm, 5 μm, 1.0 mL/min, UV 254 nm, room temperature)
with MeCN/H2O (0.05% TFA or HCOOH buffer) gradient elution.
HPLC-MS was performed on a Gilson 321 HPLC with detection performed
by a Gilson 170 DAD and a Finnigan AQA mass spectrometer operating
in electrospray ionization mode using a Phenomenex Gemini C18 150
× 4.6 mm column. Compound purity was determined using an Agilent
1100 series LC system (Agilent ChemStation Rev.A.10.02; Phenomenex-Luna-C18,
4.8 mm × 150 mm, 5 μm, 1.0 mL/min, UV 254 nm, room temperature)
with MeCN/H2O (0.05% TFA or HCOOH buffer) gradient elution.
All compounds were >95% pure via LC/MS analysis. Compounds 1–3 and 47 were a generous
donation
from our collaborators, Lilly Research laboratories. 1–3, 26, and 27 are
also commercially available. We acquired NMR and LCMS data to confirm
a match to literature reports.

(DMF) (10 mL) at 0 °C, EDCI·HCl (485 mg, 2.5 mmol), HOBt
(432 mg, 3.2 mmol), DIPEA (0.7 mL, 3.9 mmol), and DMAP (10 mg, cat.

at room temperature and monitored by TLC analysis (EtOAc/hexane 1:1)
until completion (12 h). The reaction mixture was poured into ice
cooled water (100 mL) and extracted with EtOAc (4 × 50 mL). The
combined organic layer was washed with saturated NaHCO3 solution (2 × 25 mL), dried over anhydrous Na2SO4, and concentrated under reduced pressure. This crude material
was purified by Prep-HPLC purification. This afforded N-(5-nitrothiazol-2-yl)benzamide (4) as an off-white

Synthesis of 2-Hydroxy-N-(5-nitrothiazol-2-yl)benzenesulfonamide
(54)
To a solution of 2-methoxybenzenesulfonyl
chloride (250 mg, 1.2 mmol) and 5-nitrothiazol-2-amine (175 mg, 1.2
mmol) in DCM (8 mL) at 0 °C, Et3N (0.5 mL, 3.6 mmol)
was added. The reaction mixture was then stirred at room temperature
and monitored by TLC analysis (MeOH/DCM = 1:19) until completion (16
h). The reaction mixture was poured into ice cooled water (50 mL)
and extracted with DCM (3 × 30 mL). The combined organic layer
was dried over anhydrous Na2SO4 and concentrated
under reduced pressure. The crude product was further purified by
column chromatography on silica gel (60–120 mesh) using 1%
MeOH in DCM as eluent to afford 2-methoxy-N-(5-nitrothiazol-2-yl)benzenesulfonamide
as a light yellow solid (180 mg, 47%). 1H NMR (400 MHz,
DMSO-d6): δ 8.35 (s, 1H), 7.79 (d, J = 8.4 Hz, 1H), 7.511 (t, J = 7.6 Hz,
1H), 7.12 (d, J = 8.0 Hz, 1H), 7.03 (t, J = 7.6 Hz, 1H), 3.72 (s, 3H). LCMS m/z (M – H) 313.95.

To a solution of 2-methoxy-N-(5-nitrothiazol-2-yl)benzenesulfonamide (300 mg, 0.9 mmol)
in DCM (15 mL) at 0 °C, AlCl3 (506 mg, 3.8 mmol) was
added. The reaction mixture was then stirred at room temperature and
monitored by TLC analysis (MeOH/DCM = 1:19) until completion (2 h).
The reaction mixture was quenched with ice cooled water (30 mL) and
extracted with EtOAc (3 × 50 mL). The combined organic layer
was dried over anhydrous Na2SO4 and concentrated
under reduced pressure. The crude product was further purified by
column chromatography on silica gel (60–120 mesh) using 1%
MeOH in DCM as eluent to afford 2-hydroxy-N-(5-nitrothiazol-2-yl)benzenesulfonamide
(54) as a yellow solid (200 mg, 70%). 1H NMR
(400 MHz, DMSO-d6): δ 9.96 (s, 1H),
8.26 (s, 1H), 7.66 (d, J = 8.0 Hz, 1H), 7.35 (t, J = 7.2 Hz, 1H), 6.88 (m, 2H), 1.23 (s, 3H). LCMS m/z (M – H) 299.93; HRMS (ESMS)
calcd for C9H7N3O5S2: 301.9905; found: 301.9912 (M + 1).

Synthesis of 2-(((5-Nitrothiazol-2-yl)amino)methyl)phenol
(55)
To a solution of 2-hydroxybenzaldehyde
(200 mg,
1.6 mmol) and 5-nitrothiazol-2-amine (237 mg, 1.6 mmol) in ACN (4
mL) at 0 °C, Et3SiH (1.0 mL, 6.4 mmol) and TFA (0.5
mL, 6.7 mmol) were sequentially added. The reaction mixture was then
heated at 80 °C and monitored by TLC analysis (EtOAc/hexane =
1:1) until completion (4 h). The reaction mixture was concentrated
to dryness and poured into ice cooled water (50 mL). It was extracted
with EtOAc (2 × 50 mL) and the organic layer was washed with
saturated K2CO3 solution. It was then dried
over Na2SO4 and evaporated to dryness to afford
a brown solid. The crude product was further purified by column chromatography
on silica gel (100–200 mesh) using 28% EtOAc in hexane as eluent
to afford N-(5-nitrothiazol-2-yl)oxazole-2-carboxamide
(55) as a yellow solid (81 mg, 20%). 1H NMR
(400 MHz, DMSO-d6): δ 9.76 (s, 1H),
9.61 (brs, 1H), 8.32 (s, 1H), 7.19 (d, J = 7.2 Hz,
1H), 7.13 (t, J = 7.2 Hz, 1H), 6.85 (d, J = 7.6 Hz, 1H), 6.78 (t, J = 7.2 Hz, 1H), 4.49 (s,
2H). LCMS m/z (M + H) 252.06; HRMS

Synthesis of 5-Nitro-N-(pyridin-2-ylmethyl)thiazol-2-amine
(56)
To a solution of picolinaldehyde (200 mg,
1.9 mmol) and 5-nitrothiazol-2-amine (272 mg, 1.9 mmol) in ACN (4
mL) at 0 °C, Et3SiH (1.1 mL, 7.6 mmol) and TFA (0.6
mL, 7.6 mmol) were sequentially added. The reaction mixture was then
heated at 80 °C and monitored by TLC analysis (EtOAc/hexane =
1:1) until completion (4 h). The reaction mixture was concentrated
to dryness and poured into ice cooled water (50 mL). It was extracted
with EtOAc (2 × 50 mL), and the organic layer was washed with
saturated K2CO3 solution. It was then dried
over Na2SO4 and evaporated to dryness. The crude
product was further purified by column chromatography on silica gel
(100–200 mesh) using 48% EtOAc in hexane as eluent to afford
5-nitro-N-(pyridin-2-ylmethyl)thiazol-2-amine (56) as a brown solid (81 mg, 20%). 1H NMR (400
