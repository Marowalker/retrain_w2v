In order to develop new organic materials
for optoelectronic applications,
a fundamental understanding of the electronic properties of specific
chromophore combinations must be realized. To that end, we report
“model” acceptor (A)–acceptor′ (A′)–acceptor
(A) triads in which the pendants (A′) we selected are well-known
components of organic optoelectronic applications. Our pendants are
sandwiched between two dialkoxyphenazine (A) through an alkyne bond.
The A′ was systematically increased in electron-deficiency
from benzothiadiazole (BTD-P) to naphthalene diimide
with octyl (NDI-O-P) or ethylhexyl groups (NDI-EH-P) to perylene diimide with ethylhexyl (PTCDI-EH-P) to
assess changes in the electronic properties of the resultant molecules.
Characterizations were performed using both experimental and theoretical
methods. From optical and cyclic voltammetry, we found that the electron
deficiency of each pendant was directly correlated to the energy level
of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (ELUMO). When examining the simple molecular orbital diagrams
produced at the B3LYP/6-31G* level of theory, the LUMOs were, as expected,
primarily localized on the more electron-deficient pendants. In terms
of the energy level of the highest occupied molecular orbital (EHOMO), the numerical values obtained experimentally
also correlated with values obtained computationally. Attempting to
construct a simplified model that would explain these correlated values
was not as readily apparent, given the disparate physical characteristics
of these compounds. For example, BTD-P and NDI-O-P/NDI-EH-P achieved planarity when computationally optimized, but PTCDI-EH-P adapted a “buckled” geometry on the central PTCDI,
consequently forcing the attached phenazines out-of-plane. The title
compounds showed solvent polarity-dependent fluorescence, which is
indicative of intramolecular charge transfer. In conjunction with
our theoretical study, the current system can be viewed as an extension
of donor–acceptor–donor systems. Thermal properties
characterized by differential scanning calorimetry revealed that reversible
phase transitions were only observed for BTD-P. In addition, BTD-P was found to be an efficient gelator in 1,1,1-trichloroethane
and toluene. The other compounds in this study did not form gels in
any of the solvents tested, which may have been a result of the alkyl
groups on the pendants hampering the fibrillation process.

Introduction
Controlling the energy
levels of frontier molecular orbitals, highest
occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular
orbital (LUMO), is one of the most important challenges when developing
organic π-conjugated materials for optoelectronic applications
such as light-harvesting and electron-donating or -accepting. To that
end, gaining a fundamental understanding of structure–property
correlation is important when attempting to obtain desired electronic
properties. Among the strategies to manipulate the electronic properties,
an alternating combination of chromophores with electron-donating
(D) and -accepting (A) characters may be the most intensively studied
molecular configurations, which leads to the formation of charge transfer
bands to a lower band gap.1−4 Under this molecular framework, numerous low band
gap polymers have been produced mainly as active materials for organic
solar cells.5−14 Contrary to polymeric systems, more control over the electronic
properties is possible for small and oligomeric systems. More deliberate
and complex combinations of different chromophores have led to the
creation of configurations such as ADA, DAD, DADAD, and so forth.15−21 With the aid of theoretical calculations, an in-depth understanding
regarding how D and A interact to create new energy levels has been
made.22,23 However, relatively fewer systematic studies
have been conducted on combinations of chromophores with the same
electronic character, especially for A–A′–A.24 Understanding the electronic properties of these
triads is important as these structural subunits (A and A′)
are the key elements of n-type organic semiconductors. When chromophores
with “acceptor-like” electronic character but differing
electronic magnitude are connected, it is unclear if the resulting
electronic properties follow a simple additivity rule. In a previous
study, we prepared acceptor (A)–acceptor′ (A′)–acceptor
(A) triads in which a benzothiadiazole (BTD) (A′) pendant was
flanked with two phenazines (A) through two different types of bond
connectivity, that is, C–C single and triple bonds.25 To investigate the role of structural subunits
on the electronic properties of the whole molecule, we employed a
“bottom-up” construction approach, monitoring both the
theoretical HOMO and LUMO energy levels for both configurations. One
of the key findings from this theoretical analysis was that the more
electron-deficient (BTD) dictated the LUMO level of the whole triad.
In addition, the C–C triple bond connection rendered a flat
molecular geometry for potentially better intermolecular π–π
interactions.

In this work, using the A-yne–A′-yne–A
(A–A′–A
henceforth) as the basic molecular platform, we prepared four triads
with three different types of pendants (A′) to explore the
effect of electron-withdrawing power of each pendant on the electronic
properties of each triad. Using BTD as a standard, we modified the
pendants to be stronger electron-acceptors, naphthalene diimide (NDI)
and perylene diimide (PTCDI). Detailed synthetic approaches for new
A–A′–A triads as well as their optical, electrochemical,
and thermal properties are presented. Theoretical investigations on
the energy levels, molecular orbital diagrams, and optimized geometries
were conducted to complement the experimental observations. Finally,
self-assembly of these compounds was tested through organogelation.

Results
and Discussion
Synthesis
The structures of title
compounds are presented
in Figure 1 and detailed
synthesis is described in the Supporting Information. The key reaction step to produce the title compounds was a Sonogashira
coupling reaction between intermediate 7-ethynyl-2,3-bis(octyloxy)phenazine
(6) and dibromo-pendant (pendant = BTD, NDI-ethylhexyl,
NDI-octyl, and PTCDI-ethylhexyl).

Figure 1 Molecular structures of title A–A′–A
triads.

The first step in synthesizing
the crucial intermediate 6 was nitration of m-iodonitrobenzene.26 This nitration yielded
1-iodo-3,4-dinitrobenzene
(1), which was then reduced using Sn over HCl to yield
1-iodobenzene-3,4-diamine (2).27 Then, the diamine was reacted with 2,5-dihydroxy-1,4-benzoquinone
in ethanol to produce 7-iodo-2,3-bis(hydroxyl)phenazine (3), which was further alkylated without purification. 7-Iodo-2,3-bis(octyloxy)phenazine
(4) was then used in a Sonogashira coupling reaction
with triisopropylsilyl (TIPS) acetylene to yield 7-triisopropylsilylethynyl-2,3-bis(octyloxy)phenazine
(5). Then, TIPS was removed using tetrabutylammonium
fluoride to yield intermediate 6. Intermediate 6 was employed for Sonogashira coupling reactions with corresponding
dibromo-pendants, which successfully produced the title compounds.
The dibromo-pendants (4,7-dibromo-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole, di-(2-ethyl-1-hexyl)-2,6-dibromo-1,4,5,8-napthalenetetracarboxylic
acid bisimide, dioctyl-2,6-dibromo-1,4,5,8-napthalenetetracarboxylic
acid bisimide, and di-(2-ethyl-1-hexyl)-1,7-dibromo-3,4:9,10-perylenetetracarboxylic
acid bisimide) were synthesized according to the reported procedures.

The final compounds could alternatively be prepared by coupling
reactions between 7-iodo-2,3-bis(octyloxy)phenazine (4) and diethynyl-pendants; however, we chose the current routes because
of the following two reasons; (i) diethynyl-pendant was very unstable
and (ii) the number of reaction steps are fewer with the current routes.
We note that the alternative route using 4,7-diethynyl-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole
was employed to prepare BTD-P with different alkyl lengths
in the previous communication.25 However,
we found that the reaction yield was inconsistent when 4,7-diethynyl-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole
was not carefully treated.

Under the typical Sonogashira coupling
reaction conditions (see Scheme S1), BTD-P was obtained in 43% yield. However, the reaction
conditions needed to be modified for NDI-P molecules.
For NDI-EH-P, when the reaction was conducted at 70 °C
overnight, the initially formed bright red solution turned to dark
brown. A thin-layer chromatography (TLC) analysis indicated that the
initially formed product (red solid) had been decomposed. The reaction
seemed to be highly sensitive to time and temperature. Therefore,
further trial was carried out at room temperature and the reaction
progress was closely monitored using TLC. The maximum conversion was
observed after 1.5 h of reaction, and NDI-EH-P was obtained
in 64% yield. In the case of NDI-O-P and PTCDI-EH-P, the coupling reaction was also conducted at room temperature for
2.5 and 5 h, respectively.

Unlike other compounds, the purification
of PTCDI-EH-P was extremely difficult, requiring both
silica gel and neutral alumina
column chromatography, with a yield of 28%. The structures and purity
of BTD-P, NDI-EH-P, NDI-O-P, and PTCDI-EH-P were confirmed by 1H NMR, 13C NMR, and high resolution-mass spectrometry (Supporting Information).

Optical Properties
The UV–visible absorption
spectra were obtained for all title compounds in both solution and
solid states (Figure 2). For solution in dichloromethane (DCM), all the peaks showed a
linear relationship with concentration (1–5 μM), confirming
that the absorption was free of aggregation. The absorption maximum
(λmax) for BTD-P was observed at 445
nm. Both NDI-EH-P and NDI-O-P showed longer
wavelength absorption at 514 nm, and the longest λmax of 587 nm was seen with PTCDI-EH-P. It should be noted
that the absorption patterns of NDI-EH-P and NDI-O-P are essentially identical, suggesting that the alkyl chain does
not contribute to the absorption. The red shift in the absorption
can be translated into a reduced HOMO–LUMO energy gap (Egap), and the degree of such shift becomes higher
as the electron-deficiency of the pendant increases from BTD to NDI
to PTCDI. Whether the electron-deficiency of the pendant plays a major
role in the reduction of Egap will be
investigated in greater detail.

film.

The molar absorptivity (ε)
for the title compounds at their
λmax’s were calculated from the slope of the
Beer’s law plots. These values are summarized in Table S1 (Supporting Information). BTD-P, NDI-EH-P, and NDI-O-P showed similar absorptivity
at 7 to 8 × 104 M–1 cm–1. However, the molar absorptivity for PTCDI-EH-P was
somewhat lower with ε = 2.9 × 104 M–1 cm–1.

Egopt for the title molecules was
calculated from the absorption
edge (Table 1). A trend
in smaller Egopt was seen as the electron affinity of the
pendant increased. Therefore, BTD-P, having the least
electron-deficient pendant, gave the largest Egopt of 2.51 eV. NDI-EH-P and NDI-O-P with more electron-deficient
pendants showed Egopt of 2.23 eV. The title molecule with the
most electron-deficient pendent, PTCDI-EH-P, gave the
smallest Egopt of 1.97 eV.

For the solid-state absorption,
samples were prepared as a cast
film from DCM solution. Their resulting spectra were compared with
those in solution as shown in Figure 2. The cast films showed similar absorption patterns
when compared to their solution counterparts. However, all the cast
film spectra showed a significantly red-shifted λmax from their respective solution spectrum, which could be attributed
to the formation of J-aggregates. For BTD-P, the shoulder
peak of λmax at 462 nm in solution was red-shifted
to 489 nm in the solid state; however, the peak at 445 nm in solution
was slightly blue-shifted. For NDI-EH-P and NDI-O-P, λmax at 514 nm in solution was red-shifted to
545 nm in the solid phase. The largest red shift of 36 nm was seen
for PTCDI-EH-P with λmax at 623 nm in
the solid phase.

The fluorescence (FL) spectra were obtained
for BTD-P, NDI-EH-P, NDI-O-P, and PTCDI-EH-P in DCM. The spectra shown in Figure 3 compare the FL emission
maxima (λem) of the title compounds. As in the case
of absorption, the concentration
from the emission study was kept at 5 μM in DCM, which follows
Lambert Beer’s Law to avoid emission from aggregates. The resulting
spectra were normalized for better comparison.

Figure 3 Normalized FL spectra
of title compounds in DCM solution (solid
line) and film (broken line). λexc for solution:
425 nm (BTD-P), 490 nm (NDI-EH-P and NDI-O-P), and 540 nm (PTCDI-EH-P). λexc for film: 453 nm (BTD-P), 536 nm (NDI-EH-P), and NDI-O-P (535 nm).

As shown in Figure 3, λem was significantly red-shifted going
from BTD-P to NDI-EH-P/NDI-O-P, and then
a less dramatic red shift for PTCDI-EH-P. This was a
different trend when compared to the consistent absorption shift in
the UV–vis. PTCDI-EH-P showed the longest λem of 622 nm, however with the smallest Stokes shift of 35
nm. NDI-EH-P and NDI-O-P showed λem of 591 nm, with a Stokes shift of 77 nm. BTD-P showed λem of 508 nm, with a Stokes shift of 63
nm. Absolute FL quantum yields measured using an integrating sphere
for BTD-P and PTCDI-EH-P were quite high,
61 and 54%, respectively. On the contrary, both NDI-EH-P and NDI-O-P showed only 8%.

Figure 3 also shows
the solid-state emission spectra of BTD-P, NDI-EH-P, and NDI-O-P. PTCDI-EH-P underwent a significant
aggregation-induced emission quenching, and thus the emission in the
solid state became negligible. All three compounds experienced red-shifted
emission in the solid state compared to their solution state. λem for BTD-P, NDI-EH-P, and NDI-O-P was 580, 641, and 628 nm, respectively. The degree
of red shift from solution in the same order was found to be 72, 50,
and 37 nm, respectively. Albeit small, it is interesting that the NDI-EH-P film emits a 13 nm longer wavelength than NDI-O-P. Overall, the red-shifted emission in the solid state corroborates
well with the result of UV–vis absorption spectroscopy. Both
characterizations support the formation of J-aggregates in the film.

We also examined the emission in solvents with different polarity
such as toluene, THF, and chloroform in addition to DCM. For this
study, NDI-EH-P was omitted because of limited solubility
in THF and toluene. Interestingly, all three compounds showed a positive
solvatochromism as shown in Figure 4. λem of all three compounds red-shifted
as the polarity of solvent increased. λem in each
solvent is summarized in Table S2. From
toluene to DCM, λem of BTD-P red-shifted
by 13 nm. For NDI-O-P, the red shift was the most significant,
41 nm. PTCDI-EH-P showed the smallest red shift of 7
nm. This positive solvatochromism indicates intramolecular charge
transfer (ICT).4 Among the three compounds, NDI-O-P showed the most prominent ICT, which includes FL quenching
in more polar solvents. The level of ICT also corroborates well with
the Stokes shift mentioned previously. Further discussion on this
ICT will be provided in a later section.

different polarities. λexc: 425 nm for BTD-P, 490 nm for NDI-O-P, and 540 nm for PTCDI-EH-P.

Electrochemical Properties
The effect on electrochemical
properties by changing the electron deficiency of the pendant on the
title molecules was examined using cyclic voltammetry. The compounds
were tested in a DCM solution with TBAPF6 (0.1 M) as the
supporting electrolyte, Ag/AgNO3 in CH3CN as
the reference electrode solution, and ferrocene as an internal reference.
The resulting cyclic voltammograms are shown in Figure 5. All molecules showed three reduction peaks.
The first two reductions originate from the pendants, showing a similar
pattern to the reported ones, especially for PTCDI28 and NDI.29 The third peak that
appeared consistently at Epc = ca. −1.95
V for all the molecules may be assigned to the reduction of phenazine.30 The first reduction potential can be directly
correlated to the LUMO energy level (ELUMO) of a compound, which is our primary focus. Therefore, the onset
of the first reduction peak was measured to calculate ELUMO for all title compounds, using ferrocene’s
oxidation potential of −4.8 eV with respect to vacuum.

Figure 5 Cyclic voltammograms
for the reduction of title compounds. Scan
rate: 100 mV/s.

As shown in Figure 5, the onset of the
first reduction peak decreased in energy as the
pendant of the title molecules became more electron-deficient. BTD-P gave the highest ELUMO of
−3.34 eV (Eonsetred = −1.46 V). The trend continues
with NDI-EH-P/NDI-EH-P showing a significantly
more stabilized ELUMO of −3.90
eV (Eonsetred = −0.90 V). The lowest ELUMO is seen from PTCDI-EH-P at −3.97
eV (Eonsetred = −0.83 V), however, only slightly
less than the ELUMO of NDI-EH-P and NDI-O-P. In conjunction with UV–vis spectroscopy, Egopt compression was clearly influenced by ELUMO stabilization; however, it warrants a closer analysis. Egopt compression
from BTD-P to NDI-EH-P/NDI-O-P and NDI-EH-P/NDI-O-P to PTCDI-EH-P was found to be
−0.28 and −0.26 eV, respectively, which are quite consistent.
Meanwhile, the same analysis on ELUMO resulted
in −0.56 eV (BTD-P to NDI-EH-P/NDI-O-P) and −0.07 eV (NDI-EH-P/NDI-O-P to PTCDI-EH-P). This result indicates that the ELUMO stabilization is not the sole reason for the Egopt compression. EHOMO of NDI-EH-P/NDI-O-P decreased
by 0.28 eV from that of BTD-P. Surprisingly, EHOMO of PTCDI-EH-P was increased
by 0.19 eV from that of NDI-EH-P/NDI-O-P. Considering
the fact that the electron-deficiency of NDI affects both ELUMO and EHOMO in
the same direction, EHOMO of PTCDI-EH-P was unexpectedly high. This result will be further discussed with
the theoretical analysis.

Theoretical Evaluation
As complement
to our experimental
findings, a comparative computational study was conducted for the
title molecules. HOMO and LUMO energies were determined for the extended
systems as well as for key subunits that make up these larger molecules.
All calculations were carried out at the B3LYP/6-31G* level of theory.
To understand the role of the subunits [phenazine and pendants (A′)]
in the electronic properties of title compounds, theoretical HOMO
and LUMO energies were compared (Figure 6).

Figure 6 Graphical representation of electronic properties.
Numerical values
are provided in Table 1.

For our calculations, we replaced
all extended alkyl chains with
methyl groups. Our general interest is observing energy trends, and
we have found in previous work that these trends are not impacted
by such a simplification.23 We note that NDI-P refers to both NDI-O-P and NDI-EH-P, and PTCDI-P refers to PTCDI-EH-P for
theoretical calculation. From our observations of the larger molecular
systems, it was clear that ELUMO was controlled
by the electron-deficient pendant. In the case of BTD-P, ELUMO was more stabilized than either
P or BTD as individual units. For NDI-P, the central
pendant’s (NDI) ELUMO was identical
to that of the title molecule. In the case of PTDCI-P, ELUMO was nearly equivalent to that
of the central pendant (PTCDI). An inspection of LUMO orbital diagrams
(Figure 7) for all
systems studied validates these observations. For all compounds, the
LUMO orbitals were localized on the pendant and thus electron-deficiency
of the pendant was reflected in ELUMO’s
of the whole molecules.

Figure 7 Molecular orbital diagrams of title compounds:
(a) BTD-P; (b) NDI-P; (c) PTCDI-P.

In contrast, HOMO orbitals for
all compounds were distributed to
a more or lesser degree over the entire molecule including the phenazines.
For example, the HOMO orbital of BTD-P was delocalized
throughout the molecule, albeit with more concentration on the central
unit and alkyne portion. A somewhat similar pattern was observed for PTCDI-P; however, the orbital was distributed less on phenazine.
In contrast, the HOMO of NDI-P was distributed more on
the alkyne and phenazine. Thus, the HOMO energies were not influenced
in these simple density functional calculations by the most electron-withdrawing
portion of pendant, that is, thiadiazole for BTD and imide for NDI
and PTCDI. Therefore, the electron-deficiency of the pendant did not
play as significant a role in defining EHOMO as it did for ELUMO for all systems
considered in
this work.

The energy-minimized structures of both BTD-P and NDI-P were planar (Figure 8). However, PTCDI-P exhibited
a “puckered”
shape when optimized. BTD-P and NDI-P both
had a dihedral angle of 0° between A–A′–A,
whereas PTCDI-P had a puckered angle of 17.20°.
The nonplanarity of PTCDI may be due to the steric repulsion between
C≡C and neighboring H on the pyrene. We conclude that the more
electron-deficient pendants control ELUMO values, whereas EHOMO is influenced
by a multitude of factors including subunit connectivity and the overall
geometry of the extended system. Therefore, the ability to manipulate
the LUMO energy of such extended systems is easily controlled by proper
choice of an electron-deficient subunit, whereas the ability to strategically
influence the HOMO energy of such systems remains elusive.

angle = 0°; (b) NDI-P, dihedral angle = 0°;
(c) PTCDI-P, puckered angle = 17.20°; (d) alternate
view of PTCDI-P.

The localization of the LUMO on the more electron-deficient
unit
is reminiscent of those found in D–A systems. Heteroaromatic
systems with electron-deficient C=N bond such as quinoline,
quinoxaline, phenazine, and so forth have been used as electron-acceptors31,32 for light-emitting diodes. However, there is no absolute definition
for an acceptor or a donor. The electronic role of a structural unit
is determined by the relative electron-accepting or -donating power
of the neighboring unit. For example, when a quinoline is linked to
a carbazole, quinoline acts as an acceptor, inducing ICT. In addition,
when a phenazine is sandwiched with two thiophenes, phenazine acts
as an acceptor with the LUMO localization on the phenazine. In the
current system, phenazine may act as a weak donor because of the presence
of stronger electron-accepting BTD, NDI, or PTCDI. In a sense, our
A–A′–A system can be regarded as an extended
donor–acceptor–donor system in which ICT is possible.
Indeed, ICT was well supported by the FL solvatochromism. The level
of ICT was clearly higher in the case of NDI-O-P than BTD-P because of the higher electron-accepting power of NDI
than BTD. However, in spite of the strongest electron-accepting pendant, PTCDI-EH-P exhibited the lowest level of ICT. Presumably,
this is due to the nonplanarity of the molecule limiting π-electron
delocalization.33

The predictive
power of computation when it involves identifying
trends in ELUMO and EHOMO for all molecules studied was invaluable. Clearly,
these computationally simplistic orbital diagrams as well as optimized
geometries provide greater insight into these observed physical properties.
For example, the unusually high experimental EHOMO of PTCDI-EH-P relative to those of other
molecules was clearly predicted by the theory. This result demonstrates
that theoretical evaluation serves as a crucial tool in our research
for a more complete understanding of our results.

Thermal Properties
The thermal properties of BTD-P, NDI-EH-P, NDI-O-P, and PTCDI-EH-P were studied
by differential scanning calorimetry
(DSC). Of the four title compounds, BTD-P was the only
one that showed reversible phase transitions (Figure S1). The second heating/cooling scan is presented in
order to eliminate any transition because of a pre-existing nonintrinsic
molecular arrangement. A melting endotherm (Tm) was observed at 178 °C with a heat of melting (ΔHm) of 45.65 J/g. At the cooling scan, a crystallization
exotherm (Tc) appeared at 171 °C.

Unlike BTD-P, the remaining compounds showed irreversible
thermal transition, and therefore only the first heating scan is shown
in Figure 9. NDI-EH-P showed a Tm at 254 °C
with a ΔHm of 25.73 J/g. NDI-O-P showed a lower Tm at 222 °C with
a larger ΔHm of 33.54 J/g. In spite
of the largest π-core, PTCDI-EH-P showed the lowest Tm at 192 °C with a ΔHm of 29.92 J/g. For all three compounds, there were additional
exotherms positioned shortly after Tm.
These exotherms are likely a result of a possible cyclization reaction
occurring between the triple bonds and the carbonyl groups in NDI34 or aromatic rings in PTCDI.35,36 Our attempt to characterize the materials after the DSC experiment
was unsuccessful as the materials after thermal treatment were intractable.

Figure 9 DSC thermograms
of NDI-EH-P, NDI-O-P,
and PTCDI-EH-P. Scan rates = 10 °C/min.

We initially expected NDI-EH-P would
have a lower Tm than NDI-O-P as ethylhexyl is
bulkier than the octyl group, which would hamper the π–π
interaction. However, the results indicated otherwise. The longer
octyl group reduced Tm more than the bulkier
but shorter ethylhexyl. Nevertheless, it should be noted that the
straight octyl group of NDI-O-P facilitates better molecular
packing and thus crystallization revealed by the larger ΔHm. The low Tm of PTCDI-EH-P is consistent with the nonplanar geometry predicted
by theory, which limits intermolecular interactions.

Organogelation
In our molecular design, the dialkoxyphenazine
(A) unit was included not only to control certain electronic properties,
but to promote self-assembly as well. Assembly properties are important
for organic conjugated molecules as solid-state properties are largely
affected by molecular organization. Organogelation is a simple and
reproducible way to prepare one-dimensional (1D) fibers via nonbonding
intermolecular forces such as hydrogen bonding, π–π,
and van der Waals interactions.37−40 We anticipated that including dialkoxyphenazine in
the title compounds would facilitate organogelation, as dialkoxyphenazine
has been known to be an efficient gelator.41−43 When comparing
the title compounds, the pendant in BTD-P is the only
unit without an alkyl group which would not interfere with fibrillation
driven by dialkoxyphenzaine. The remaining compounds contain alkyl
side groups on the pendants, and it is unclear if the alkyl side groups
on the pendants support or interfere with fibrillation. To test organogelation,
the compounds were suspended in solvent at known concentrations and
then heated until they were fully dissolved. The solutions were then
left undisturbed as they cooled to room temperature and observed for
the formation of a gel. When turning the vial upside down, successful
gelation was identified if there was no flow of solution, which is
evidence of solvent-trapping in a 3D network of 1D fibers. The gelation
properties in select solvents are summarized in Table 2.

TCTFE, 1,1,2-trichloro-2,2,1-trifluoroethane; TCE, 1,1,1-trichloroethane;
EA, ethyl acetate; THF, tetrahydrofuran. Critical gelation concentration
is shown in parentheses.

Various types of solvents were tested including nonpolar hydrocarbon,
aromatic, polar, and halogenated solvents. It was found that BTD-P was the only efficient gelator which gelled TCE (5 mM)
and toluene (6 mM). The fact that other compounds lack the fibrillation
capability suggests that the alkyl groups in the pendants interfere
with fibrillation. Note that PTCDI-EH-P was soluble in
all of the solvents tested in spite of the large pendant. This may
be due to the non-flat nature of the molecule causing ineffective
intermolecular organization.

To investigate the morphology,
field-emission scanning electron
microscopy (FE-SEM) characterization was conducted
on the xerogel of BTD-P. The xerogel was prepared by
drying a TCE gel. At a low magnification (Figure 10A), fiber-like structures were observed.
However, the thickness of the fibers was too large, considering the
transparency of the TCE gel (Figure 10A inset). Presumably, the structures were formed during
the solvent evaporation. We attempted to identify individual fibers
at a higher magnification. As shown in Figure 10B, silhouettes of fused fibers were observed;
however, we were unable to have a better focus because of the lack
of sharp fiber edges. We believe the thin soft fibers formed in organogel
lost their fine structures during solvent evaporation producing fused
fibers.

Conclusions
In
this work, we have successfully synthesized and characterized
four A–A′–A triads with varying electron-deficiency
of the pendants A′. Optical and cyclic voltammetry characterizations
revealed that the increasing electron-deficiency of pendants from
BTD to NDI to PTCDI lowered ELUMO, albeit
to different degrees. Nevertheless, Egopt was reduced
steadily from BTD-P to NDI-EH-P/NDI-O-P to PTCDI-EH-P. This is due to the contributions of each molecule’s EHOMO, which changed rather randomly. Computational
analysis indicated that the LUMO orbitals were localized on the pendants;
consequently, ELUMO energies were virtually
controlled by the pendants. Theoretical characterizations revealed
that BTD-P and NDI-P adapted planar geometries,
whereas PTCDI-P optimized to a puckered configuration
likely because of steric repulsions between the alkyne carbon and
the neighboring hydrogen on PTCDI. This nonplanar geometry contributed
to the HOMO orbital localizing on the pendant and the pyrene units
as opposed to the attached phenazines. In contrast to the simplicity
of our LUMO energies, the HOMO energies for our molecules were more
difficult to explain, presumably because there were more parameters
involved in defining this energy including overall molecular structure,
subunit connectivity, and so forth. FL solvatochromism was observed
for the title compounds which is indicative of ICT. Although the present
systems contain apparent electron-acceptors, based on the ICT and
LUMO orbital distribution, they can be viewed as an extension of a
donor–acceptor–donor system because of the difference
in the electron-deficiency of A and A′. It seems that the electronic
role of certain structural subunits is determined by the relative
electron-accepting power of a neighboring unit. DSC characterization
revealed that only BTD-P possessed reversible phase transition.
In addition, BTD-P was found to be the only gelator in
TCE and toluene. For other compounds, alkyl side groups on pendants
may have interfered with fibrillation.

The structurally simple
triads in this work serve as a model system
for shedding light on basic physical properties when chromophores
with different electron deficiencies combine. Correlation between
experiment and theory provides a deeper understanding into our observations
although there are still complexities regarding certain physical properties
(HOMO energies) that defy a simple explanation. Further studies with
a greater variety of systems would be necessary to elucidate the governing
factors to control EHOMO.
