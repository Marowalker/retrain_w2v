A novel colorimetric
sensor based on the TiO2/poly(acrylamide-co-methylene bis acrylamide-co-2-(3-(4-nitro-phenyl)thioureido)ethyl
methacrylate) nanocomposite was synthesized via a surface modification
strategy; methacryloxypropyltrimethoxysilane was used to provide reactive
vinyl groups on the surface of TiO2 nanoparticles for the
successful surface polymerization of Am (acrylamide), MBA (methylenbisacrylamide),
and NPhM (2-(3-(4-nitrophenyl)thioureido)ethyl methacrylate) components.
The successful preparation of nanocomposites was confirmed using Fourier
transform infrared, 1H NMR, 13C NMR, scanning
electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, thermogravimetry
analysis, and X-ray diffraction methods, and the sensing ability of
the probe toward fluoride ions was investigated using naked-eye detection
and UV–vis measurement. The interaction of the prepared polymeric
nanocomposite with fluoride ions elicited a significant visible change
in color from pale yellow to orange and was further affirmed by a
clean interconversion of the two absorption bands at 330 and 485 nm.
The selective binding ability of the polymeric nanocomposite towards
fluoride over other anions, such as I–, Cl–, Br–, AcO–, H2PO4–, and H2SO4– was further explored; the prepared chemosensor could detect fluoride
ions in acetonitrile with a detection limit of 3 μM.

==== Body
Introduction
In recent decades,
the field of identifying and sensing anions
has attracted significant attention because of their detrimental effects
on environmental and biological processes. Fluoride ions, in comparison
with other anions, have been studied more extensively because it plays
an important role in biology, medicine, and environmental sciences.1,2 Also, fluoride ions are ubiquitous in the health of teeth and osteoporosis
treatment,3,4 and they show unique properties such as
ease of absorbability and slow release in human body which are among
several reasons responsible for attracting great attention.5 The excessive concentration of fluoride ions
could cause dental fluorosis and severe kidney and gastric problems.6−8 In addition, chronic bone disease fluorosis is related to the high
levels of fluoride ions in drinking water.9 Further, the Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) set 4 mg/L
(∼0.21 mM) for fluoride ions as its drinking water standard.
Furthermore, fluoride ions have many military usages, including refining
uranium and detecting nerve agents for instance sarin and soman.10

Over the past decade, several analytical
methods have been applied
to measure fluoride ions sensitively and selectively; electrochemical
methods, mass spectrometry, fluorescent methods, colorimetric methods,
and as such are examples of these techniques.10 Among these analytical procedures, optical methods11−21 are considered as powerful tools because of their low cost, simplicity,
ease of use, and quick response time.22,23 These methods
are mainly based on the N–H proton transfer from the donor
unit to the fluoride ions, which induces N–H proton–deprotonation.24 In this protocol, the most common hydrogen donators
are moieties such as amine,25 pyrrole,26 amide,27 urea,28−30 and thiourea.31,32 These probes are often neutral
in nature and contain acidic hydrogen (−NH or −OH) that
binds to fluoride ions through hydrogen bonding and causes a colorimetric
response.3,33 In this arena, nanomaterials that exhibit
optical responses, for example, fluorescence, chemiluminescence, and
colorimetric hold great promises for fluoride ions sensing.34 Among a wide variety of nanomaterials deployed
for fluoride ion detection, include several oxides namely V2O5, MoO3, TiO2, silica, and zirconium
dioxide. Cost-effective TiO2 nanoparticles (NPs) are especially
important due to their chemical stability in varied environments,
durability, nontoxicity, and high corrosion resistance properties;
however, drawbacks associated with their instability in aqueous environments
and large aggregate formation have prompted many researchers to modify
their structures with polymers.35 To the
best of our knowledge, there has not been any report for the modification
of TiO2 NPs with a polymer toward selective fluoride ion
detection. The modified polymeric shell surrounding TiO2 NPs provides improvement in stability as well as the detectability
toward fluoride anions.36,37 They exhibit a higher
degree of sensitivity and selectivity over small molecules because
of their repeating structure that may give rise to effects such as
multivalency or cooperativity in the context of supramolecular interaction.
However, the most notable differences between small molecule and polymeric-based
sensors stem from the ability of the latter to gain signal amplification,
to provide high levels of sensitivity in terms of detecting fluoride
anion.38

In this work, a novel polymeric
nanocomposite was used as a highly
selective and sensitive colorimetric sensor for the detection of ultratrace
levels of hazardous (fluoride) ions in organic solutions. First, to
obtain the polymeric shell on the surface of the TiO2 NPs,
acrylamide (AM), 2-(3-(4-nitrophenyl)thioureido)ethyl methacrylate
(NPhM), and methylenbisacrylamide (MBA) were used as a monomer, comonomer-probe,
and cross-linker, respectively; MBA was used as a cross-linker to
bestow a three-dimensional structure to reach maximal interaction
between the polymeric shell and fluoride ions. In this process, the
changes in color from the pale yellow to orange were observed upon
the chemosensor interaction with fluoride ions (graphical abstract
and Scheme 1). The
obtained trace levels of detection could be attributed to the repeating
structure of the polymer as well as high surface area of the ensuing
polymer–nanocomposite material.

bis acrylamide-co-2-(3-(4-nitro-phenyl)thioureido)ethyl
methacrylate) [TiO2/poly(Am-co-MBA-co-NPhM)] nanocomposite are shown in Figure 1. The broad bands below 800,40 1623, and 3228 cm–1 were ascribed to
the vibration of Ti–O, OH bending vibrations of surface absorbed
water molecules, and OH groups of TiO2 NPs,41,42 respectively (Figure 2a). The spectra of modified TiO2 NPs with methacryloxypropyltrimethoxysilane
(MAPTMS) (Figure 2b)
exhibited a band in the region of 1715 cm–1 which
was assigned to the ester functional groups of MAPTMS. The successful
synthesis of 1-(2-hydroxyethyl)3-(4-nitro-phenyl)thioureido (Figure 1c) was confirmed
with the appearance of bands at 1322 cm–1 (C=S),43 1496, 1582 cm–1 (NO2), 1636 cm–1 (C=C), 2947–2998 cm–1 ([−(CH)n−]),
and 3215 cm–1 (−OH groups). The spectra of
NPhM (Figure 1d) exhibited
a band in the region of 1700 cm–1 that was attributed
to conjugated ester group. The successful polymerization of amidic
monomers and NPhM on the TiO2–MAPTMS nanocomposite
(Figure 1e) was confirmed
by the appearance of new peaks at around 1657 and 1736 cm–1 which were associated with amidic groups of Am and MBA and ester
groups of NPhM, respectively.

X-ray Diffraction Analysis
X-ray powder diffraction
is a powerful tool for the investigation of crystallographic structure
of the NPs and nanocomposites. The TiO2 NPs show well-defined
X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns corresponding to reflections in the
anatase phase (the characteristic peaks at 2θ = 25.35, 37.77,
47.83, 54.22, 62.92, 75.40).44 Despite
loading organic moieties onto the TiO2 NPs surface, typical
Bragg diffraction peaks were retained, thus affirming the stability
of TiO2 NPs under the employed condition of the polymerization
reaction. Moreover, a broad diffraction peak at 2θ = 10°–30°
corresponding to the scattering of amorphous polymeric shell was observed
(Figure 2).

Thermal
Analysis
In Figure 3, the thermogravimetry analysis (TGA) curve
is indicated to evaluate the thermal stability of the synthesized
compounds and the percentages of the organic component in the TiO2–MAPTMS and TiO2/poly(Am-co-MBA-co-NPhM) nanocomposites. As can be seen from Figure 3, the thermogram
for TiO2 NPs showed that these NPs are stable over 25–1000
°C. The weight loss within the temperature range of 550–700
°C in Figure 3b is believed to determine the percentage of conjugated MAPTMS on
the TiO2 NPs surface. In contrast, the TGA curve for TiO2/poly(Am-co-MBA-co-NPhM)
nanocomposites showed two weight loss steps. The first stage below
200 °C possibly is due to the elimination of moisture in the
sample. The major weight loss from 250–750 °C (approximately
72%) is the step that could be attributed to the percentage of polymeric
shell in the final nanocomposite (Figure 3c).

nanocomposites, and TiO2/poly(Am-co-MBA-co-NPhM) nanocomposites.

Scanning Electron Microscopy Images
The uniform spherical
morphology of TiO2 NPs and the TiO2/poly(Am-co-MBA-co-NPhM) nanocomposite is evident
from Figure 4a,b. The
scanning electron microscopy (SEM) observation indicates the thickness
of the ensuing product is about 20 nm (Figure 4a) and 120 nm (Figure 4b), respectively. Clearly, the product is
roughly spherical in geometry and has a smooth surface morphology
with quite a very narrow size distribution. The results showed that
grafting MAPTMS onto TiO2 NPs and polymerization of monomers,
as a shell on NPs, were successfully accomplished.

Transmission Electron Microscopy Images
Polymer grafting
on TiO2 NPs and the effect of polymeric shell on the size
of nanocomposite were investigated using transmission electron microscopy
(TEM) analysis. Figure 5 shows TEM images of pristine TiO2 and polymeric nanocomposite
which confirms that the grafting of the polymeric shell on the TiO2 NPs surface has taken place. The mean size of TiO2 NPs and polymeric shell on surface of TiO2 NPs are 20
and 120 nm approximately, respectively.

Naked-Eye Colorimetric Detection
Naked-eye detection
of fluoride ions was performed using a colorimetric sensor in an organic
medium of acetonitrile (ACN) at a low concentration level of about
(3 μM). The visual detection of fluoride ions was carried out
in a wide concentration range of these ions (3–600 μM),
and with increasing the concentration of fluoride ions, the color
changed from pale yellow to orange. The obtained results demonstrated
that the features of the TiO2/poly(Am-co-MBA-co-NPhM) nanocomposite optical sensor compared
to the other spectroscopic methods of ion detection, are simplicity
and high level of sensitivity. The described method is based on selective
interactions between the hydrogen-bond donor moiety and fluoride ions
(creating a hydrogen bonding between the proton of chemosensor and
fluoride ions), thus eliminating the requirement of sophisticated
instruments.

Addition of excess tetrabutylammonium fluoride,
a base known to promote a second deprotonation of 4-nitrophenyl thiourea,
resulted in the formation of an orange color attributable to the monoanion
(Figure 6).

Figure 6 Chemosensor
color changes with different concentrations of fluoride
ion (3–600 μM).

Investigating Chemosensors Anion Interaction
The visual
response of the chemosensor to various anions such as F–, Br–, Cl–, I–, HSO4–, H2PO4–, and AcO– was investigated
using colorimetric analysis. By adding aforementioned anions to receptor
solutions of chemosensor with a 2:1 ratio, a significant color change
from pale yellow to orange was immediately observed exclusively in
the presence of fluoride ions. On the other hand, the addition of
OAc2 ions similarly led to color transformation from pale
yellow to orange. Therefore, the proposed method suggested a clear
technique to detect fluoride and acetate ions via a naked-eye route.
The change in color may be due to the deprotonation of NH protons
in the ligand using ions, which affects the electronic properties
of the chromophore and ensures a strong color alteration (Figure 7).

Figure 7 Colorimetric response
of chemosensor in the presence of various
anions; color changes in ACN solution (150 μM).

UV–Visible Investigation of Chemosensor
Regarding
the results of colorimetric analysis, UV–visible spectroscopy
studies were performed upon interactions with acetate and fluoride
ions at 150 μM concentration level. Adding fluoride ions to
a chemosensor in the organic medium showed a new peak at a longer
wavelength of 485 nm, while the addition of other ions did not exhibit
any change in the chemosensor spectrum, as shown in Figure 8. The F– ion
showed the highest absorbance in the 485 nm region, because of its
alkaline nature in organic solvents, which combines with itself as
[HF2]−, leading to the deprotonation
of hydrogen bonding agents, that in most cases is accompanied by color
changes. After fluoride, acetate ions showed the highest changes in
absorption which is because two oxygen groups of acetate, due to their
proper spatial structure, can interact with both NH groups of thiourea
and as a result cause changes in absorption.

Figure 8 Absorption spectra of
chemosensor upon the addition of 2 equiv
of fluoride ions, Cl–, Br–, I–, H2PO4–, HSO4–, and AcO– ions in ACN
solution (150 μM).

Titration of F– Ions
It was further
observed that gradual addition of a standard solution of F– ions (TBAF) to a 150 μM solution of chemosensor in ACN, resulted
in progressive increase in the absorption band at 480 nm in the UV–visible
spectra with a simultaneous decrease in the absorption band at 330
nm. This was accompanied by the appearance of an isosbestic point
at 389 nm (Figure 9).

Figure 9 UV–visible titration spectra of chemosensor (150 μM)
with 0.5–4 equiv of TBAF in ACN solution.

When fluoride ion concentration increased to the level of 1 equiv
with respect to the thiourea moiety, a color change from pale yellow
to orange was discerned in the probe solution, and this color became
deeper on further addition of fluoride ions with concomitant increase
in the intensity of absorption band at 485 nm. The observed colorimetric
changes in probe solutions reached its limiting value with the addition
of 2 equiv of fluoride ions.

A more detailed investigation,
obtained from UV–visible
titration results, also indicates that the limiting value in the λmax centered at 485 nm is achieved using 2 equiv of fluoride
ions. This observation could be rationalized on the premise that the
initial addition of fluoride ions establishes a hydrogen bond interaction
between these ions and NH groups proton of probe through 1:1 hydrogen-bonded
adduct formation. If further addition of fluoride ions beyond 1 equiv
continues, the first hydrogen bonded fluoride ions cooperate to bind
the second ones which leads to the formation of 1:2 hydrogen bonds
between the probe and fluoride ions. Subsequently, in this ratio the
deprotonation occurring at concentration levels higher than 2 equiv
of fluoride ions, causes the formation of a more stable bi fluoride
[HF2]− species.45,46 Experimental observations indicate that the appearance of a new
absorption band at higher wavelengths (485 nm) during probe–fluoride
interaction could be either due to the formation of hydrogen bonds
with the NH groups of chemosensor or its deprotonation by fluoride
ions. Both these events would result in a visual color change possibly
through efficient intramolecular charge transfer.47

Conclusions
In summary, a new simple
and easy-to-use colorimetric sensor based
on a hybrid of organic and inorganic material comprising 3-(4-nitro-phenyl)thioureido
moieties has been designed and synthesized through free-radical polymerization.
Its selectively results in the recognition of F– ions among other anions which was achieved through the color transformation
from pale yellow to orange, as well as UV–visible spectroscopy
with the appearance of a new absorption peak at a longer wavelength
of 485 nm. The fluoride ion was detected through the formation of
hydrogen bonds between NH groups of nanocomposites and F– ions, followed by the deprotonation process of thiourea groups of
the chemosensor at concentration levels beyond 2 equiv of F– ions. The detection limit of colorimetric sensor is 3 μM for
fluoride ions which indicates its high level of sensitivity.

TiO2 NPs Synthesis
In order to synthesize
TiO2 NPs, a solution of ammonium sulfate (1.5 mol L–1) and titanium(IV) chloride (0.75 mol L–1) was used which was heated up to 75 °C and then was kept at
this constant temperature for 90 min. Under high-speed stirring, in
the next step, ammonium hydroxide (2.5 mol L–1)
was added to the above solution (at pH = 7). The insoluble sediment
ensued as the precipitated product which was then filtrated and washed
with a mixture of water/ethanol and dried at 60 °C. The temperature
used to calcine the sample was 450 °C (4 h), and then, it was
set aside to cool down slowly at ambient temperature.39

TiO2–MAPTMS Nanocomposite
Preparation
Half a gram of TiO2 NPs was dissolved
in 20 mL of toluene
to prepare TiO2–MAPTMS NPs. The mixture was placed
in an ultrasonic bath for 15 min followed by the addition of 1.5 mL
of MAPTMS, then atmospheric nitrogen was applied to keep the solution
for 24 h at room temperature while being continuously stirred. The
final product was separated by centrifuging, and toluene was used
to wash it twice; then, TiO2–MAPTMS nanocomposite
was dried under vacuum at 60 °C for 24 h.

Monomer Synthesis
1-(2-Hydroxyethyl)-3-(4-nitro-phenyl)thioureido
Synthesis
In a flask, 1 g (5.55 mmol, 1 equiv) of 1-iso-thiocyanato-4-nitrobenzene
was dissolved in 20 mL of THF solution. Subsequently, 369 μL
(6.10 mmol, 1.1 equiv) of ethanolamine was added dropwise to the stirring
solution, and the reaction was kept at ambient temperature for 12
h. At the end of the reaction, the solvent and unreacted ethanolamine
were separated by a rotary evaporator affording a pale-yellow solid
(95% yield) (Figures S1 and S2 in the Supporting Information).

NPhM Synthesis
In a flask, 1.43
g (5.92 mmol, 1 equiv)
of product was dissolved in 25 mL of methylene dichloride (DCM) and
was then added to a well-stirred mixture of 998.4 μL (7.10 mmol,
1.2 equiv) of dry TEA. At 0 °C, 582 μL (5.92 mmol, 1 equiv)
of methacryloyl chloride, in 20 mL dried DCM, was added dropwise to
the reaction solution during a period of 30 min (Figures S3 and S4
in the Supporting Information).

Polymerization Step
To cover the surface of vinyl-modified
TiO2 NPs with a polymeric layer of monomers AM (0.5 g),
MBA (1.2 g), NPhM (0.5 g), and vinyl-modified TiO2 (0.95
g) were all stirred in a solution of 17 mL DMSO/2-ethyl-1-hexanol
(with 2:5 ratio) at ambient temperature for 1 h. Subsequently, AIBN
(0.15 g) was added under the nitrogen gas environment for 15 min and
then refluxed for 5 h at 80 °C. The synthesized polymer was obtained
by removal of the solvent and then washed three times with ethanol
and water. Finally, it was dried at 50 °C for 24 h (Scheme 2).

Absorption Measurement
and Colorimetric Detection of Fluoride
Anions by a Chemosensor
In order to measure the detection
limit of fluoride anion by chemosensor, the various concentrations
(1, 3, 36, 75, 150, 300, 600 μM) were prepared in 2 mL of ACN.
Then, each of the prepared solution of anion fluoride was added to
a 20 mg of sensor, and the detection limit of anion fluoride was sensed
by 3 μM sensor.

Ion-Selective Sensing System
In
order to evaluate the
selectivity of chemosensor for fluoride anions, each of the anions
F–, Cl–, Br–, I–, HSO4–, H2PO4–, and OAc– (solution of 150 μm in 2 mL) was prepared. Each of the prepared
solutions was separately added to 20 mg of chemosensor, and the color
changes of chemosensor were examined by naked eye detection (Figure 7) and a UV–vis
spectrophotometer (Figure 8).

Instruments
Optical sensor spectroscopy
measurements
were performed using a solid-state 2100-UV-vis Shimadzu spectrometer.
SEM is an effective method for investigating the morphological characteristics
of NPs; thus, it was evaluated using Philips XL-30 SEM. TEM images
of TiO2 NPs and polymeric nanocomposites were obtained
using a Philips CM-300 microscope. TGA and studying thermal stability
of the synthesized materials were carried out using TGA/DTA BAHR:
STA503. Patterns of XRD were obtained using Siemens D5000 diffractometer,
and a 2θ scan was done in the range of 2θ = 10°–80°
with monochromatic Cu Kα (λ = 1.54060 A). The FT-IR measurements
were performed using a BOMEM MB-Series FT-IR spectrometer in the form
of KBr pellets. On a Bruker, 300 and 500 advance instruments in CDCl3 and DMSO; δ in ppm, J in Hz, H and 13C NMR spectra were obtained.
