Analytical
methodology for direct investigation of antioxidant
systems continues to be a pressing research area. Consumer demand
for natural products requires an increase in natural antioxidants;
thus, fast, high-throughput, and cost-effective screening methods
are in demand. In this study, square-wave voltammetry and gas chromatography
with flame ionization detection (GC-FID) were used in conjunction
to monitor antioxidant and fatty acid degradation, respectively, during
the accelerated degradation of an omega-3 fatty acid sample. Butylated
hydroxytoluene, sesamol, and rosemary extract were investigated as
antioxidants. It was determined that voltammetry could be used to
monitor the reduction in oxidation current, which provides a direct
assessment method for the reduction of native antioxidant concentration
throughout the accelerated degradation. Furthermore, results showed
that voltammetry could be used to monitor fatty acid degradation similarly
to the fatty acid methyl ester analysis routinely performed using
gas chromatography separation. Both voltammetry and GC-FID methods
reached similar conclusions about antioxidant quality and efficiency
for omega-3 fatty acid protection.

==== Body
Introduction
In recent years, the
study of omega-3 (ω-3) fatty acids has
greatly increased. This is largely due to their positive health benefits,
including the reduction of cardiovascular-related deaths, prenatal
brain development, and having potential implications in inflammation
control.1−4 This interest has sparked a boom in ω-3 fatty acids being
incorporated into a wide variety of consumer products, including direct
supplementation, as functional foods, and in cosmetics.5−8 As ω-3 fatty acid consumer intake has increased, a need for
effective antioxidants has become vital. Although intake of ω-3
fatty acids may provide health benefits, there is also evidence that
consumption of oxidized ω-3 fatty acids may have undesirable
consequences beyond foul smells and tastes and may negatively impact
overall health.9−11 Esterbauer et al. found that oxidized ω-3 fatty
acids reduced growth and increased inflammation markers in animals.12 There are few studies directly investigating
human subjects and impacts of oxidized ω-3 fatty acids; however,
the studies in the literature suggest that there are no significant
adverse health effects over short-term monitoring.13 Without more complete long-term studies on the effects
of oxidized ω-3 fatty acids, along with contradictory evidence
found in the literature, it remains prudent to ensure that ω-3
fatty acids that reach public consumption are well protected from
oxidation with high-efficiency antioxidants.

Another trend in
consumer interest is a higher demand for more
“clean labels” from their products.14 To this extent, interest in natural antioxidants has increased
in recent years partly due to this demand for products with reduced
amounts of synthetic molecules. This has led to a variety of studies
investigating natural antioxidant species. One such species that has
shown promise as a natural antioxidant is sesamol. Hwang et al. determined
that sesamol provided improved protection of ω-3 fatty acids
compared to butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), an established synthetic
antioxidant currently used in consumer products.15 Sesamol was also determined to provide protection that
was comparable to a leading natural antioxidant, rosemary extract
(RE).

The work of Hwang et al. provided insights related to
lipid degradation
in the presence of natural antioxidants; however, no direct analysis
of the antioxidant degradation was performed. This is a critical connection
to make for functional food researchers, as real-time monitoring of
antioxidants during accelerated degradation studies would provide
a more complete understanding of the relationship between antioxidant
concentration and fatty acid protection. Although it is known that
some antioxidant species such as TBHQ and sesamol can continue to
provide protection after degrading to products such as dimers or radicals,
direct monitoring of primary antioxidant levels could provide insights
toward better characterization and understanding of established and
novel antioxidants used in commercial products.16−18

In the
current work, a novel application of electrochemistry is
proposed to bridge the gap in knowledge between antioxidant depletion
and fatty acid degradation. Electrochemistry has been widely used
in the investigation of antioxidant species due to the low cost, rapid
analysis times, low consumable requirements, and the direct analysis
of electroactive species.19−21 Voltammetric techniques have
been used to investigate prominent antioxidant species such
as vitamin E (tocopherol).22,23 Our group previously
investigated incorporating voltammetry into routine applications.
Specifically, voltammetry was compared to high-performance liquid
chromatography (HPLC) to monitor the removal of tocopherols from a
commercial product. It was determined that the removal of tocopherol
species could be reliably detected via differential pulse voltammetric
screening of fish oil samples after chromatographic removal of
tocopherols.19 Voltammetric analysis of
antioxidants is poised to be a critical tool for continued investigation
of antioxidant systems, which could help solve complex issues within
functional food research. These methods provide a direct analysis
of antioxidant species, in comparison with spectroscopic methods such
as ABTS or DPPH radical scavenging methods.

In this study, square-wave
voltammetry is used in conjunction with
gas chromatography coupled to a flame ionization detector (GC-FID)
to elucidate a potential cause and effect relationship between antioxidant
levels and fatty acid composition. Square-wave voltammetry was selected
due to its background suppression, faster scan times, and improved
sensitivity relative to differential pulse voltammetry.21 BHT, sesamol, and RE were added to commercial
fish oil that was stripped of any supplemented antioxidants. Samples
were subjected to an accelerated degradation protocol and monitored
to track the changes in both fatty acid composition and antioxidant
oxidation current. Individual antioxidants were investigated to determine
their unique electrochemical behavior, including oxidation potential,
limit of detection, and lower limit of quantitation. Additionally,
antioxidant- and control-treated fish oil samples were subjected to
a time-course study. Oxidative currents for the antioxidants, along
with eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), were
recorded in conjunction with fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) analysis
of the fatty acids in each sample. Results support the ability of
electrochemistry to be used as a real-time tool to monitor fatty acid
degradation alongside relative antioxidant concentrations; thus providing
a rapid and accessible alternative to GC-FID analysis.

Results
Determining
Figures of Merit for Antioxidants
There
has been recent interest in utilizing electrochemistry for the
characterization of antioxidant systems, including BHT and sesamol.24−27 However, there are few, if any, direct measurements on figures of
merits, and none to the knowledge of the authors in the presence of
polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) samples. Before engaging in quantitative
work, the oxidation potentials of each antioxidant were first determined
using 1 mM concentrations. The voltammograms are shown in Figure 1. Each antioxidant
has a slightly different oxidation potential versus an Ag/AgCl reference
electrode, with sesamol oxidizing at 0.804 V, RE oxidizing at 1.01
V, and BHT oxidizing at 1.16 V. Sesamol was observed to have a narrower
peak when compared to RE and BHT. This suggests that sesamol
is readily able to donate electrons, while yielding little current
from the reverse process through reduction of the recently oxidized
sesamol.21 This is supported by the fact
that sesamol forms dimers, which are also readily oxidizable.28 For RE, the smaller oxidation current and broader
peak are likely a result of competing reversible oxidation–reduction
currents due to the different species that comprise rosemary extract.
It has been shown that both carnosic and rosmarinic acid, which are
the primary components of rosemary extract, produce reversible electrochemical
properties when subjected to anodic and cathodic currents.29,30 BHT also shows a smaller current and a wider peak than sesamol,
along with a broader decay slope, which could be partially due to
the steric hindrance of BHT and sesamol.

Figure 1 Overlay of voltammograms
for sesamol (solid line), BHT (dotted
line), and RE (dashed line) all at 1 mM concentrations. Potential
was scanned versus a silver–silver/chloride reference electrode.

After qualitative analysis of
the antioxidants, figures of merit
were investigated. Figure 2 provides an overview of the calibration curves for sesamol,
BHT, and RE. Due to the low sensitivity of RE, additional concentrations
were added at 50 and 250 μM. Sesamol produced the highest sensitivity
of the three antioxidants, followed by BHT and RE respectively.
The best-fit equations are also provided in Figure 2 to juxtapose the large differences in analytical
sensitivity between each antioxidant. An overview of the LOD, LLOQ,
and correlation co-efficient values are detailed in Table 1. The linearity of
each species was acceptable, with RE having the lowest correlation
co-efficient at 0.9688 for standards tested between 50 μM and
1 mM yielding a LOD and LLOQ of 74.77 and 249.26 μM, respectively.
Both BHT and sesamol provided improved linearity with correlation
co-efficients of 0.9984 and 0.9873, respectively. BHT linearity was
determined for standard concentrations between 1 μM and 1 mM,
yielding LOD and LLOQ of 6.26 and 20.87 μM, respectively. Sesamol
did not provide appreciable signal at 1 μM and was therefore
investigated between 10 μM and 1 mM. Due to the heightened sensitivity,
sesamol was found to have the lowest LOD and LLOQ at 2.64 and 8.80
μM, respectively. The figures of merit for RE are higher than
the other two species; however, they were below the proposed concentration
of 840 μM that would be used in the time study, so it was decided
to proceed. Overlaid voltammograms are provided for each antioxidant
as an average of background -subtracted traces for each concentration
in Figure 1 of the Supporting Information section for reference.

Square-Wave Voltammetry of Fish Oil Samples
during Accelerated
Degradation
Three aliquots of each treatment were removed
from heating at days 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 14, and 17. For each aliquot,
two square-wave voltammograms were collected. Figure 3 compares the average background-subtracted
voltammetric signals for all four treatments. The control oil, which
was stripped of commercially added antioxidants and was not further
supplemented, was found to have two oxidation peaks. It was observed
that the oxidation potentials of RE and BHT overlapped with the native
oxidation peaks of the stripped fish oil. However, sesamol’s
oxidation peak was fully resolved and did not have any overlap with
other peaks. The oxidation peaks observed within the stripped fish
oil have been described previously by Lanez et al.; however, there
was only a supposition made that individual peaks were due to EPA
and DHA individually.31 To better understand
how EPA and DHA were oxidized, standards were investigated for their
oxidation potentials.

Figure 3 Overlay of background-subtracted voltammograms obtained
on day
0 for stripped fish oil only (control; solid line) and supplemented
with BHT (dotted line), sesamol (dashed line), and RE (dash-dotted
line). Background was collected using only the 1:2 v/v benzene–methanol
solvent system.

Figure 4A provides
overlays of 0.25 M EPA and 0.17 M DHA standards in the solvent system
only. These concentrations mimic the concentration of each fatty acid
in PUFA supplements used in the study. Both EPA and DHA show an oxidation
peak near 1.19 V vs Ag/AgCl. EPA exhibits a second oxidation peak
near 0.6 V vs Ag/AgCl; however, the standard was only guaranteed to
be 95% pure, so there may have been a contaminant present. Figure 4B details a stripped
fish oil sample spiked with EPA initially, followed by DHA. Addition
of the EPA appears to cause an increase in both oxidation peaks; however,
subsequent addition of DHA further increases the oxidation peak at
1.19 V. The combined data suggest that the fatty acid oxidation peak
near 1.19 V is a combined oxidation current from EPA and DHA, whereas
the fatty acid peak near 1.03 V is from a different species.

Figure 4 (A) Overlay
of background-subtracted voltammograms of 0.17 M DHA
(solid line) standard and 0.25 M EPA (dotted line) standard collected
separately. Background was collected using only the 1:2 v/v benzene–methanol
solvent system. (B) Overlay of stripped fish oil (solid line) spiked
first with 0.17 M DHA (dotted line) directly followed by 0.25 M EPA
(dashed line). Voltammograms were not background corrected to elucidate
effects of DHA and EPA on total current.

Validating the two native oxidation peaks exhibited by stripped
fish oil allowed for the time-course overlays for each treatment to
be fully examined, which are shown in Figure 5. Figure 5A shows the control treatment, for which only the oxidation
of fish oil is observed. It was noted that the oxidation current magnitude
(peak current) decreased with time. Oxidation current is a measure
of the maximum analyte flux to the electrode surface. The peak current
is related to the analyte concentration through the Cottrell factor
shown in eq 1. 1  The Cottrell factor relates
the concentration
of a species proportionally to the change in current. This relationship
is assumed for linear sweep voltammetry but also holds true for
square-wave voltammetric currents, which provide roughly 93% of expected
signal generated for normal pulse voltammetry conditions.21 Thus, the decrease in current observed for the
control treatment is related to a decrease in total nonoxidized fatty
acids.

Figure 5 Overlays of days 0 (solid line), 3 (dotted line), 7 (dashed line),
and 10 (dash-dotted line) background-subtracted voltammograms for
stripped fish oil only (control; A), BHT (B), sesamol (C), and RE
(D). Background was collected using only the 1:2 v/v benzene–methanol
solvent system. Control treatment produced two oxidation peaks associated
with the fish oil only, with the second peak confirmed as a combination
of EPA and DHA. Oxidation of BHT overlapped with the DHA and EPA peaks,
whereas sesamol and RE oxidation produced unique peaks in their respective
voltammograms.

Figure 5B–D
displays the day 0, 3, 7, and 10 background-subtracted voltammograms
for BHT, sesamol, and RE. BHT is oxidized at 1.16 V vs Ag/AgCl, as
shown in Figure 1.
Therefore, the oxidation current for BHT overlaps with the fish oil
oxidation and cannot be directly resolved. Sesamol and RE treatments
are detailed in Figure 5C,D. Sesamol’s oxidation peak is fully resolved from the sample
peaks, whereas RE is adequately resolved at higher concentrations.
Upon degradation, RE signal begins to overlap with the sample oxidation
peaks as the concentration of reduced RE decreases. Figure 5 shows that all treatments,
except for day 10 of the control treatment, show a decrease in observed
oxidation current for the fish oil oxidation peaks from day 0 to day
10. After day 10, all oxidation peaks are indistinguishable from the
background noise and can no longer be detected. It was observed among
all treatments that the samples became more solid over time as they
oxidized. The control treatments were the first to show these signs.
They exhibited viscous properties by day 5 and became a solid gel
by day 10. This most likely resulted in an increased sample resistance,
which expressed itself as a higher overall current in day 10 as compared
to previous time points. The antioxidant-treated samples did not show
solidification until day 10. At this point, only BHT showed signs
of morphology change, whereas sesamol and RE remained unchanged until
later time points.

To further analyze the time-course dependency
of oxidation currents,
the background-subtracted current signals were converted to a percentage
of day 0 values. In Figure 6A, the current percentage was plotted from day 0 to 10 for
each antioxidant peak to investigate the rate of antioxidant depletion.
BHT was included in an effort to provide full context to the data;
however, it bears little significance since the oxidation current
for BHT is a combination of the antioxidant, EPA, and DHA currents.
A general trend is seen that the oxidation current of each species
decreases with time, which is indicative of antioxidant concentration
decreasing. The peak currents of both RE and sesamol fall to roughly
10% of their initial values by day 10, which suggests that they are
being readily used to inhibit lipid oxidation. BHT has a higher peak
current percentage than the other antioxidants on day 10; however,
this can be attributed to the combination of signals observed at the
potential where BHT is oxidized. Studies were undertaken to determine
if adsorption may have contributed to the decrease in antioxidant
signal over time. It was determined that adsorption had little to
no impact on the oxidation current decline, as presented in Figures
2 and 3 of the Supporting Information section.

values. (A) BHT (black circles), sesamol (white circles), and RE (black
triangles) oxidation current percentages are overlaid from day 0 to
day 10. All oxidation current percentages decrease with time. (B)
Oxidation current percentages for fatty acid peak 1 are overlaid for

are overlaid for stripped fish oil only (control; black triangles),

for data within a given time point are noted with appropriate symbols.

Figure 6B,C details
the peak currents of the two oxidation peaks observed in fish oil.
Again, current signals were converted to a percentage of their day
0 value for individual treatments. It was determined that the second
oxidation peak in fish oil is due to a combination of EPA and DHA;
however, the first oxidation peak observed from the fish oil sample
remains unknown. Although unidentified, the initial oxidation peak
provides a unique platform for monitoring lipid degradation in all
treatments, as it has a lower amount of overlap between antioxidant
signals when compared with the second oxidation peak. In Figure 6B, the control treatment’s
peak current percentage decreased rapidly and is roughly 10% of the
total current observed on day 0 by day 3. The trend observed for the
first fatty acid oxidation peak is very similar for sesamol and BHT,
with a 50% decrease observed by day 3. This decline continues for
BHT to 40% on day 7 and 20% on day 10. However, sesamol preserves
the oxidation peak through day 7, maintaining 50% of the day 0 value.
By day 10, conservation of the oxidation peak ends, and the sesamol-treated
sample begins showing further reduction in the fatty acid peak oxidation.
RE also shows a decrease in oxidation current over the initial days
of the study, dropping to roughly 60% of the day 0 value by day 5.
However, RE does not show any further decrease and maintains a 60–70%
value for the fatty acid oxidation peak through day 10. The data support
RE as the antioxidant that preserved the fish oil oxidation signal
most effectively, followed by sesamol and BHT respectively.

The second fatty acid peak, which will be referred to as the EPA/DHA
peak, was also analyzed similar to the first peak and is provided
in Figure 6C. Due to
the overlap, BHT was not included in the data presented, as there
was no way to deconvolute the two peaks. The EPA/DHA peak provides
a direct comparison point for the GC-FID studies that were also performed
and have been historically used for monitoring fatty acids. Similar
to Figure 6B, the control
treatment for the EPA/DHA peak showed a decrease in signal compared
to the antioxidant treatments. The control treatment decreased to
50% of the day 0 value on days 2 and 3 and further decreased in value
from 20 to 30% of the day 0 values for days 5–10. Sesamol also
had a decrease in EPA/DHA peak current percentage between days 0 and
3; however, it conserved a significantly larger signal compared to
the control treatment for days 5 and 7. By day 10, the sesamol EPA/DHA
peak current percentage decreased to control treatment levels. RE-treated
samples were the only samples to maintain a significantly elevated
oxidation signal for the EPA/DHA peak compared to the control sample
through day 10. It is important to note that the RE EPA/DHA peak current
percentages were not statistically different from sesamol, except
for day 10. This suggests that RE provided similar protection to sesamol
through day 7 and continued protecting EPA and DHA through day 10,
whereas sesamol did not.

GC-FID Analysis
To provide a comparison
point to the
electrochemical studies, GC-FID analysis was also performed on each
sample. An overview of the peak area percentages for the GC-FID analysis
of EPA and DHA is shown in Figure 7. For both EPA and DHA, the control treatment showed
an immediate decrease in peak area from day 0 to day 1, with a continued
decrease until the value reached a minimum on days 14 and 17. An oddity
occurred with the control treatment on day 3, which yielded an apparent
negative spike in peak areas for EPA and DHA. It was noted earlier
that the viscosity of the control treatments started to change on
day 5. It remains possible that the day 3 samples had an abnormally
high oxidation of fatty acids that yielded no physical change in the
sample. Regardless, the general trend of decreasing peak area was
consistent for both EPA and DHA and is in line with similar results
from previous studies.15 All antioxidant
treatments showed no notable changes through day 7, and they were
statistically different than the control values. On day 10, all antioxidants
saw a decrease in peak area for EPA and DHA, yet remained statistically
higher than the control treatment values. RE maintained a preferential
signal compared to sesamol, which was superior to BHT. The signals
for antioxidant-treated samples converged at day 14. By day 17,
all treatments were similar, which suggests that the majority of the
fatty acids had been oxidized.

Figure 7 Peak area percentages are overlaid for
stripped fish oil only (control;
white triangles), BHT (black circles), sesamol (white circles), and
RE (black triangles) for both EPA (A) and DHA (B). Statistical differences
for data within a given time point are noted with appropriate symbols.

Discussion
The
main purpose of this study was to provide further characterization
of the antioxidants BHT, sesamol, and RE, along with probing the possibility
of antioxidant depletion being monitored via electrochemical methods
in relation to fatty acid degradation. BHT, sesamol, and RE were all
found to have distinct oxidation potentials with varying levels of
sensitivity for electron transfer at a carbon electrode surface. The
difference in sensitivity was thought to be a potential metric of
antioxidant capacity, which has been investigated using a variety
of methods, including spectroscopic techniques such as ABTS and DPPH
radical scavenging assays. Yeo et al. investigated DPPH response to
sesamol and BHT, along with lipid degradation methods such as conjugated
diene and p-anisidine values.32 Mixed results
were observed between the DPPH studies and the actual protective ability
of each antioxidant in the presence of lard samples. Arteaga et al.
directly compared electrochemical and DPPH methods on a number of
low-molecular-weight compounds and found a strong correlation between
antiradical power and oxidation potentials.33 This is not surprising, as the voltage required to remove an electron
should be related to the ability of a species to scavenge a DPPH radical
through free energy. However, the authors did not directly compare
the antioxidant’s ability to protect lipid degradation; therefore,
no conclusive evidence was found to relate electrochemical metrics
and antioxidant abilities. The data presented in this study provide
no clear relationship between antioxidant capacity characterization
and in situ capabilities. RE yielded the lowest analytical sensitivity,
yet provided superior protection of EPA and DHA compared to sesamol
and BHT. The figures of merit and methodology presented in this study
provide an important characterization for a number of intensely studied
antioxidants; however, continued investigation into metrics connecting
electrochemical characterization and antioxidant capacity will help
researchers identify new antioxidant candidates in a targeted way.

Antioxidant depletion was monitored via oxidation current percentages,
as shown in Figure 6A. A direct decrease in oxidation current can be seen for all antioxidant
species, which should relate to a depletion in concentration through eq 1. Although the correlation
between a decrease in peak current and antioxidant concentration is
evident, there remains varying possibilities for what causes the decrease
in analytical signal. Nonoxidized antioxidant levels may decrease
in response to other species than strictly fatty acid radicals. One
of the most likely candidates is dissolved oxygen. Numerous studies
report the effects of oxygen content on lipid degradation. Fujisaki
et al. found that in high-oleic safflower oil, decreasing the oxygen
content from 20 to 2% greatly decreased the oxidation rate of tocopherol.34 Although no direct comparison was found for
dissolved oxygen content in bulk fish oil, values of 10.3 ppm for
processed soybean oil and 5.42 mg/L for extra virgin olive oil provide
a baseline for dissolved oxygen content in bulk oils.35,36 These values are significantly lower than the manufacturer values
for EPA and DHA, which are 2.92 × 105 and 2.02 ×
105 mg/L, respectively. Furthermore, Min and Wen reported
that dissolved oxygen content in soybean oil was completely consumed
within 48 h of an accelerated degradation study at 55 °C.35 If this assumption holds for our samples, it
is likely that within the first 2–3 days of heating the decrease
in antioxidant current is related to dissolved oxygen and fatty acid
degradation. However, the final days of heating would result in antioxidant
levels being primarily related to interactions with degraded fatty
acids.

With potential limitations in mind, an exciting finding
in this
work was the relative effectiveness in which antioxidant protections
of EPA and DHA could be visualized and determined using both electrochemistry
and GC-FID methods. Figure 6B shows that little statistical difference exists between
antioxidant treatment peak currents through day 7, which is consistent
with the GC-FID analysis results outlined in Figure 7. In both the electrochemistry and GC-FID
analyses, it was concluded that RE preserved the signal for fatty
acids more strongly than sesamol, which in turn was found to preserve
signal more strongly than BHT. Both techniques also were able to identify
day 10 as a key time point in the separation of each antioxidant,
along with the superior performance of RE. Although GC-FID FAME analysis
provides superior LOD and LLOQ for fatty acids, similar conclusions
were reached for antioxidant effectiveness using both methods.37

This work provides new paths for exploration
into real-time analysis
of both antioxidant and fatty acid levels. By monitoring levels of
antioxidants, along with fatty acid levels, electrochemistry provides
a direct, quick, rugged, and transportable method for potentially
assessing quality during the proposed shelf-life of a product. Furthermore,
future work could include correlating sensory panel feedback and oxidation
currents to determine if there is a threshold level that can be detected
by consumers. These efforts may allow for relatively inexpensive and
fast analysis of products suspected of having unacceptable levels
of omega-3 fatty acids through antioxidant or fatty acid analytical
signal. Another area of opportunity for this work may be within the
manufacturing or restaurant industries. Square-wave voltammetry could
provide a more direct method for determining if a product has degraded
in a manufacturing or a restaurant environment prior to foul taste
or smells developing. Finally, using square-wave voltammetry, a library
of voltammograms for varying fatty acids could be generated to build
on current knowledge and characterization tools of these systems.
These areas of research provide the potential to yield fast, inexpensive,
and rugged methods to provide higher quality products to consumers
in an effort to preserve the functional food aspects, along with health
and well-being qualities of a given product.

Materials
Commercial
ω-3 fish oil purified from sardines and anchovies
and supplemented with tocopherol was obtained from Nordic Naturals
(YE-1022/10680677, Watsonville, CA). Aluminum oxide (199974-1 KG,
Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), sand (S25516B, Fisher Science, Waltham,
MA), Pyrex glass wool (3950, Corning Inc., Corning, NY), and hexanes
(H302-4, Fisher Science) were used for stripping the fish oil. Guardian
Rosemary Extract 08 (Danisco), butylated hyrdoxytoluene (V218405-Sample-K,
Sigma-Aldrich), and sesamol (S3003-25g-A, Sigma-Aldrich) were used
as standards for the figures of merit investigation. The electrochemical
system was comprised of a CH Instruments 660E SN:A3192, using a three-electrode
configuration consisting of a platinum counter electrode (CHI115,
CH Instruments, TX), silver–silver/chloride reference electrode
(CHI111), and a glassy carbon working electrode (CHI104). The solvent
system used for the electrochemical studies was 1:2 v/v benzene–methanol
(benzene – BX0220-5, EMD Millipore, Germany; methanol –
A412-4, Fisher Chemical). It had a final concentration of 0.12 M sulfuric
acid (A300-500, Fisher Scientific), which is an optimized solvent
system reported by Litescu et al.22 For
FAME analysis, Hach tubes were sealed using sealing tape (ContainerSeal,
Diversified Biotech, MA), and methyl esterification was performed
using 3N methanolic HCl (33050-U, Sigma-Aldrich). Extraction was performed
with UltraPure DI water and hexanes (L-18419, Fisher Scientific).
EPA and DHA were obtained from Larodan (Larodan, Sweden; EPA –
10-2005 at 95% purity; DHA – 10-2206 at 97% purity).

Methods
Antioxidant
Stripping from Commercial Fish Oil
Antioxidants
were removed from commercial fish oil, as previously described.19,38 Briefly, commercial fish oil was passed through an aluminum oxide
column using hexanes as a mobile phase. Fish oil was collected and
spun on a rotovap under vacuum to remove excess hexanes. Stripped
fish oil was tested using electrochemistry to determine if supplemented
antioxidants were removed successfully. Stripped fish oil was stored
at −80 °C under argon until needed for further experimentation.

Accelerated Degradation of Control and Treated Fish Oil Samples
Freshly stripped fish oil was divided into four batches. Three
batches were supplemented with 0.84 mM of the antioxidants BHT, sesamol,
and RE. The fourth batch was used with no further augmentation and
served as a control treatment. Each batch of fish oil was distributed
into 2 g aliquots and stored in 20 mL scintillation vials. Enough
scintillation vials were prepared for each batch, such that each time
point of the study was represented in triplicate, for a total of 30
individual vials prepared for every treatment. The vials were stored
at 40 °C with their caps loosely fitting. Data were collected
on days 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 14, and 17. On day 17, all samples exhibited
gel-like structural qualities, so further testing was canceled.

Antioxidant Figures of Merit Determination
Antioxidant
standards were created in varying concentrations between 1 and 1000
μM. Each standard contained 750 μL of stripped fish oil,
an appropriate amount of antioxidant standard for the given final
concentration, and enough solvent such that every sample had a final
volume of 8.25 mL. Each standard concentration was prepared freshly
in triplicate directly before testing to provide a consistent amount
of time from preparation to analysis for every sample. Prior to testing
a new concentration, the glassy carbon electrode was polished for
30 s in an alumina slurry, followed by a 10 min soak in hexanes, then
another 10 min in the solvent. Finally, three voltammograms were collected
as background traces before introducing the electrode to a new standard
concentration. Each standard voltammogram was background subtracted,
and the oxidation current was plotted against the antioxidant concentration
to generate a calibration curve. All voltammograms were collected
using a CH Instruments potentiostat, a glassy carbon working electrode,
silver–silver/chloride (Ag/AgCl) reference electrode, and a
platinum counter electrode. Data were generated using square-wave
voltammetry. The potential was scanned from 0.3 to 1.5 V (vs Ag/AgCl)
at a frequency of 2 Hz in increments of 0.004 V and an amplitude of
0.005 V. The quiet time prior to each scan was 2 s, and the sensitivity
was set to 10–5 A/V. These parameters are equivalent
to a scan rate of 8 mV/s. Limits of detection (LOD) and lower limits
of quantitation (LLOQ) for each species were determined using the
following equations 2   3  In both eqs 2 and 3, “s” is the standard deviation of
the lowest observable change
in background signal with the addition of a standard.

Square-Wave
Voltammetric Analysis of Control and Treated Fish
Oil Samples
Electrochemical measurements were carried out
using an electrode configuration and voltammetric parameters identical
to those described in the Figures of Merit section above. Each day, the working electrode was polished using
a polishing kit (CHI120, CH Instruments, TX). After polishing the
working electrode, all electrodes were soaked in hexanes for 10 min,
then in the solvent system for an additional 10 min. Three voltammograms
were performed to condition the electrode. The fourth voltammogram
collected was used as a background data file and was subtracted from
all sample voltammograms. Three sample vials for each of the four
treatments were removed from the oven. An amount of 750 μL was
micropipetted from each sample vial into a Pyrex test tube (15 mm
× 150 mm). Solvent system (7.5 mL) was added to each test tube.
This process was repeated in duplicate for every sample vial, which
yielded a total of six voltammetric traces collected for each treatment
for every time point investigated. Directly before electrochemical
recording, each test tube was vortexed for 15 s before transferring
the entirety of the contents to a 10 mL electrochemical cell. The
electrodes were inserted into the sample, and the voltammogram was
collected. The electrochemical cell was cleaned with hexanes between
each treatment.

Gas Chromatography–Flame Ionization
Detector Analysis
of Fatty Acid Profile
Each sample vial removed for a given
time point was also analyzed using GC-FID. Each sample (20–25
mg) was placed into a Hach tube (10 mm × 100 mm). Methanolic
HCl (1 mL, 3 N) was then added to each test tube. All test tubes were
capped and sealed with elastic tape to prevent atmospheric gas exchange.
Test tubes were placed on a heating block for 90 min at 90 °C.
After heating, test tubes were placed under cold water for 30 s. Deionized
water (1 mL) and 2 mL of hexanes were then added to each test tube.
The test tubes were once again capped and vortexed for 60 s. The organic
layer was transferred to target vials and placed in an autosampler
of a Trace 1310 GC-FID, fitted with a Supelco SP-2380 column (30 m
× 0.25 mm I.D. × 0.2 μm film thickness). Each sample
(1 μL) was injected into a split inlet held at 300 °C with
a split ratio of 50:1. Flow rate was held constant at 1 mL/min. An
initial oven temperature of 130 °C was held for 2.5 min. After
this, the temperature was increased at 4 °C/min until 140 °C,
6.75 °C/min to 150 °C, 2.5 °C/min to 180 °C, 3.75
°C/min to 203 °C and was held for 1 min. The oven was then
increased at 4.75 °C/min to 220 °C, such that the total
program took 30 min. The FID was held at 250 °C with a gas make
up of 350 mL/min of air, 30 mL/min of nitrogen, and 35 mL/min of hydrogen.

Statistical Analysis
Statistical analysis for significance
was performed using the SigmaPlot 13.0 software suite. Data sets were
analyzed using a Bonferroni test with significance set to p < 0.05. For clarity purposes, the statistical differences
between treatments were only reported within a time point to highlight
the antioxidant properties of each treatment.

Safety Considerations
The solvent system used for the
electrochemical work contains benzene, which is a known carcinogen,
mutagen, and is flammable. Special attention to PPE was observed,
and all works were performed in a fume hood.
