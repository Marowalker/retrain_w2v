The influence of
weak interactions on the donation/back-donation
bond components in the complex [(NHC)Au(SeU)]+ (NHC = N-heterocyclic carbene; SeU = selenourea) has
been studied by coupling experimental and theoretical techniques.
In particular, NMR 1H and pulsed-field gradient spin-echo
titrations allowed us to characterize the hydrogen bond (HB) between
the −NH2 moieties of SeU and the anions
PF6– and ClO4–, whereas 77Se NMR spectroscopy allowed us to characterize
the Au–Se bond. Theoretically, the Au–Se and Au–C
orbital interactions have been decomposed using the natural orbital
for the chemical valence framework and the bond components quantified
through the charge displacement analysis. This methodology provides
the quantification of the Dewar–Chatt–Duncanson (DCD)
components for the Au–C and Au–Se bonds in the absence
and presence of the second-sphere HB. The results presented here show
that the anion has a dual mode action: it modifies the conformation
of the cation by ion pairing (and this already influences the DCD
components) and it induces new polarization effects that depend on
the relative anion/cation relative orientation. The perchlorate polarizes SeU, enhancing the Se → Au σ donation and the
Au → C back-donation and depressing the C → Au σ
donation. On the contrary, the hexafluorophosphate depresses both
the Se → Au and C → Au σ donations.

Introduction
The Dewar–Chatt–Duncanson
(DCD) framework for the
characterization of the coordination metal–ligand bond1,2 certainly has a central role in inorganic chemistry. It was proposed
to rationalize the interaction between an olefin with a transition
coinage metal (M), but it has been rapidly adopted as a general scheme
for the coordination of other ligands (L),3 including phosphanes,4−6 carbon monoxide,7 and
carbenes.8,9

In short, according to the DCD theory,
contributions of the M–L
coordinative bond can be mainly divided into two terms: M ←
L σ donation, from the filled orbitals of the ligand to the
empty orbitals of the metal with axial symmetry, and M → L
π back-donation, from the filled d orbitals of the metal to
empty orbitals of the ligand with planar symmetry.

During the
years, this framework gained an enormous success, so
much so that it has been recently adopted also for molecules without
any transition metal, as selenones,10 phosphinidenes,11,12 and chalcogeniranium cations,13,14 among others. On the
other hand, it also led to some misconceptions: for example, according
to an old classification of the metals, the fact that the stretching
frequency of the carbonyl moiety in [LAu(CO)]n+ is generally higher than that of the free CO15−17 (non-classical carbonyl18) was considered
as a proof that gold is unable to give back-donation. Nowadays, it
is known that this conclusion is wrong, as the carbonyl frequency
is given by the large gold-induced C ← O polarization that
outweighs the effect of back-donation.7

Also regarding the N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligands,19 initially they were classified as strong σ
donors and very poor π acceptors,20,21 but the π-acid
properties of NHCs have been recently re-evaluated and extensively
studied, both experimentally8,9,22,23 and theoretically.24−28

Therefore, the correct evaluation of the DCD components of
an M–L
bond is extremely important, especially now that the rational design
of “new” catalysts is a real possibility. For this reason,
in the recent past, the group of Tarantelli and Belpassi carried out
a systematic combined experimental–theoretical work on the
characterization of the Au–L bond,7,26,29−31 in many cases by using
the charge displacement (CD) analysis.32 The latter is a computational tool that decomposes the orbital interaction
between two fragments according to irreducible representations of
the group symmetry of the system31 or,
in absence of an adequate symmetry, to the natural orbital for the
chemical valence (NOCV) framework.33

In the recent years, the same group and others demonstrated (and,
in some cases, explained) that also weak interactions can influence
the performances of gold(I)-based catalysts. For instance, π
stacking can enhance the catalytic activity of complexes containing
a pyrene moiety;34 hydrogen bonding acceptors
can direct and facilitate the nucleophilic attack by a rational ligand
design35,36 or by a wise choice of the counterion.37−43 Indeed, the interplay between covalent and noncovalent interactions
recently led to interesting results in dynamic combinatorial library-driven
synthesis44−46 (also applied to biomolecules47,48), surface chemistry,49,50 and reactivity of halogen-containing
moieties.51

More specifically, the
presence of a noncovalent interaction can
influence the covalency of a chemical bond. For example, when I2 establishes a halogen bond,52 the
I–I bond lengthens until, in the extreme cases, it breaks and
becomes a halogen bond itself.53,54 In a similar way, the
C–Se bond order in selenourea is influenced by the presence
of the hydrogen bond (HB) acceptors.55

We therefore asked ourselves whether and how second-sphere weak
interactions can influence the DCD components of an M–L bond.56 In order to do this, we decided to use the organometallic
salt [(IPr)Au(SeU)]+ PF6– (1X, IPr = 1,3-bis(2,6-diisopropylphenyl)imidazol-2-yliden, SeU = selenourea, X– = PF6–, Scheme 1).57 The carbene ligand has been chosen
for giving enough stability to the complex, while the PF6– anion for being a poor Lewis base that can be
easily replaced by other stronger HB acceptors. Finally, SeU has been chosen for being a HB donor and for possessing an NMR-active
nucleus, the 77Se, that can effectively probe the variations
of Au–Se and Se–C bonds. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated
recently that an anion interacting with the amine protons of SeU makes the halogen bond between selenium and a polarized
iodine (as in IC6F13) stronger.55 This is because the interaction NH···X– makes the zwitterionic resonance structure more important,
inducing a larger negative charge on selenium, which in its turn becomes
more basic.

Scheme 1 Two Main Resonance Structures for 1+
In this paper, we characterize the HB adducts between 1+ and two anions through experimental
techniques,
such as NMR titrations, pulsed-field gradient spin-echo (PGSE), and 77Se NMR spectroscopy, and theoretically by means of density
functional theory (DFT) (B2PLYP/def2-TZVP//BP86-D3/def2-TZVP level58) and NOCV-CD analysis.59,60 Here the Lewis acid (the cationic gold moiety) is much stronger
than a polarized iodine, but the coordination bond is also more complex,
in terms of active components, than the XB. In this case, the coordinated SeU can have many resonance structures and the two most important
ones are depicted in Scheme 1.

The results indicate that the anion has a dual mode
action: it
modifies the conformation of the cation by ion pairing (and this already
influences the DCD components) and it induces new polarization effects
that depend on the relative anion/cation relative orientation. The
perchlorate polarizes SeU, enhancing the Se →
Au σ donation and the Au → C back-donation and depressing
the C → Au σ donation. On the contrary, the hexafluorophosphate
depresses both the Se → Au and C → Au σ donations.

Results
and Discussion
NMR Studies
The characterization
of the HB between 1+ and an anion
requires some consideration
on the experimental conditions to be used. Indeed, because 1+ is a salt, it is important to minimize
the ion-pairing effect61 to avoid any interference
between the anion under examination and the anion already present
in the salt as a counterion. An effective strategy can be the use
of an easily replaceable, poorly coordinating, and poorly hydrogen-bonded
acceptor anion, such as PF6–, a polar
solvent, such as acetone-d6, and a low
salt concentration, say around 10 mM. Considering the available information
about the aggregation of gold(I)-62 and
tetraalkylammonium salts,63 the illustrated
strategy seems adequate to study “isolated” cations
of 1+ in solution. The addition
of an excess of tetraalkylammonium salt NR4X will lead
to the formation of the HB adduct/ion pair 1+···X–.

The interaction
between 1+ and PF6–, for instance, has been studied adding tetraethylammonium
hexafluorophosphate (TEAPF6)
to a 8.5 mM solution of 1PF6 and monitoring
the 1H NMR chemical shift of the protons on the carbene
backbone (CH) and the two amino protons (NHa and NHb) (Figure 1). All of them indeed are acidic sites64 and, therefore, potential sites for the HB interaction with the
anion.

Figure 1 1H NMR chemical shift variation of (a) 1PF6 (0.0119 M in acetone-d6) and
(b) 1PF6 (0.0085 M in acetone-d6) as a function of (a) [TBAClO4] and (b) [TEAPF6]. Solid lines represent the best-fit equations.

Experimental fitting65 of experimental
data led to three different HB adduct formation constants (KPF6,CH, KPF6,NHa, and KPF6,NHb). Their values are 1.1 ± 0.3, 3.5 ± 0.5, and 1.5 ±
0.6 M–1. All the association constants are low,
coherently with the low basicity of PF6–. Anyway, a difference between the acidic sites can be noted, and
the interaction of the amine protons in pseudo-cis with respect to
selenium is stronger than the others, likely for the possibility of
having two cooperative HBs, as it generally happens with the urea-like
moiety.66

The same experiment has
been carried out in the absence of the
organometallic fragment, titrating free SeU with TEAPF6. Unfortunately, the broad signal
of the amino protons does not shift considerably after the addition
of an excess of TEAPF6. For this
reason, a standard 1H NMR titration is not feasible and
a 1H PGSE NMR titration is needed.67 In fact, by means of the latter, the diffusion coefficient (Dt) of the species under examination can be measured,
and aggregation processes can be evaluated, even if very weak or involving
many species.68,69

The hydrodynamic volume
of SeU (VH) which can be
derived from the value of Dt(70) goes from 176 to 205 Å3 in the
absence and presence of an excess of TEAPF6 (Table 1). The corresponding association constant (KPF6,SeU) is 2.0 ± 0.3 M–1. It can be noted that the latter is smaller than KPF6,NHa, demonstrating that the metal
center polarizes the coordinated SeU, making it more
prone to establish hydrogen bonding with the anion (structure b in Scheme 1).

Using tetrabutylammonium
perchlorate (TBAClO4) instead
of TEAPF6, the 1H
NMR titration of 1+ in acetone
leads to the following results: KClO4,CH,KClO4,NHa, and KClO4,NHb are
19 ± 2, 278 ± 30, and 211 ± 40 M–1, respectively. All the values are considerably higher than in the
case of 1+/PF6–, coherently with the higher basicity of the perchlorate
anion. In this case, the CH/NHa selectivity is much higher,
likely because of the larger stability of the supramolecular cycle
between the two N–H moieties and the two Cl–O HB acceptors.

As given above, the titration in the absence of the gold fragment
has to be carried out by using the PGSE NMR technique, because of
the broadness of the NH NMR peak. Moreover, in this case, diffusional
data have been fitted with a biexponential decay instead of the standard
monoexponential one (see Experimental Section for details). The same thing happens when a benzoate anion is used,55 likely for a chemical exchange between the amino
protons and water, which is facilitated by basic anions. In fact,
of the Dt values obtained by the biexponential
fitting, the smallest one is compatible with SeU (around
23 × 10–10 m2 s–1), whereas the largest one is relative to a very small molecule (around
50 × 10–10 m2 s–1, presumably water).

Focusing only on the smallest value of Dt obtained by the fitting procedure (Table 1 and Supporting Information), the VH of SeU goes from
176 Å3 in the absence of TBAClO4 to 235 Å3 in the presence of a large
excess of TBAClO4. Considering
that the van der Waals volume of the perchlorate anion is 50 Å3, we can say that practically all selenourea in solution interact
with the perchlorate. Fitting the data listed in Table 1, the association constant between SeU and ClO4– (KClO4,SeU) results to be 101 ± 9 M–1. Comparing the latter with KClO4,NHa (278 M–1), we can say
that the HB is greatly enhanced by the coordination of SeU on the metal fragment, again because of the polarization of the
ligand.

The systems described above have been characterized
also by 77Se NMR spectroscopy. The selenium nucleus of
the isolated SeU in acetone-d6 resonates at
220 ppm, whereas when it interacts with the gold fragment, the frequency
is lowered down to 174 ppm, indicating a larger amount of electronic
density around the nucleus (resonance b in Scheme 1). This value is slightly lowered even more
by the presence of an excess of TBAClO4 (173 ppm, [1PF6] = 10 mM, [TBAClO4] = 80 mM), whereas an excess of TEAPF6 induces a deshielding effect (176 ppm,
[1PF6] = 10 mM, [TEAPF6] = 150 mM).

The titration of 1+ with tetraetylammonium
chloride or tetrabutylammonium benzoate did not lead to the determination
of the corresponding association constant, as in their presence, the
NH NMR peaks broaden and disappear. This indicates that the amine
protons of selenourea are involved in a dynamic process. A likely
hypothesis can be the equilibrium depicted in Scheme 2.

Scheme 2 Possible Reaction between 1+ and Basic Anions
Finally, tetrabutylammonium sulfate resulted to be too
hygroscopic
to be dried and used in a titration like this.

Computational Studies
DFT studies have been carried
out to quantitatively analyze the bonds between gold and SeU or gold and carbene in the presence and absence of HB. To save computational
resources, the IPr ligand has been simplified substituting the aromatic
substituents with methyl groups ([(NHC)Au(SeU)]+, 1s+). The geometry of the
following adducts has been optimized: 1s+, 1sPF6, and 1sClO4. For all of them, the NOCV-CD analysis
has been performed with the following fragmentation schemes: [(NHC)Au]+···[SeU] and [NHC]···[Au(SeU)]+ for 1s+, [(NHC)Au(SeU)]+···[X]−, [(NHC)Au]+···[(SeU)X]−, and [NHC]···[Au(SeU)X] for 1sX.

From the DFT-optimized geometries,
the C–Se bond in isolated SeU results to be 1.831
Å (Mayer bond order71 = 1.63). The
interaction with the gold moiety (1s+ structure) elongates the Se–C bond up to 1.887 Å
and lowers the Mayer bond order to 1.24. When PF6– interacts with the two amino groups, the Se–C bond becomes
1.925 Å and the bond order is 1.16, whereas in the presence of
ClO4–, the Se–C bond becomes 1.933
Å and the bond order is 1.11. A qualitative difference can be
noted between the geometries of 1sPF6 and 1sClO4 (Figure 2). In the latter,
the anion interacts with the amino groups, forming a strong HB (average
O···H distance of 1.75 Å), and with the hydrogens
of one methyl group on the carbene, forming a weaker HB (2.518 Å).
In the former, the anion interacts with the amino groups, forming
a weak HB (1.995 Å) and with both the methyl groups of the carbene
through weak HBs (2.57 Å). The distance anion···gold
is much lower in 1sPF6– (around 3.3 Å) than in 1sClO4 (around 4.9 Å).

Figure 2 DFT-optimized geometries
(BP86-D3/def2-TZVP level) for (a) 1sPF6 and (b) 1sClO4.

The Se–C bond length is
already demonstrated to be a sensitive
probe for the interactions in which SeU is involved,
becoming longer in the presence of a NH···benzoate
HB or a Se···ICF3 XB and even longer in
the presence of both.55

First, the
Au–Se and Au–C bonds will be analyzed
in 1s+. The energy decomposition
analysis (EDA)72 shows that the total interaction
energy (Eint) between the fragments [(NHC)Au]+ and SeU is −73.1 kcal/mol (Supporting Information), of which −5.6
are the steric contribution (Est, Pauli
+ electrostatic), −5.6 are the dispersion contribution (Edisp), and −61.8 kcal/mol is due to the
orbital interaction (Eoi).

By using
the NOCV methodology, Eoi can
be further decomposed into chemically relevant contributions, numbered
with an integer number k (Δρk), each of which describes a particular charge rearrangement
upon the adduct formation with respect to the fragments [(NHC)Au]+ and SeU (see Computational
Details). Further, each contribution is also associated with
a portion ΔEk of
the total orbital energy of the adduct.

In the case of the Au–Se
bond in 1s+, for Δρ0 (ΔE0 = −44.0 kcal/mol),
the 3D charge rearrangement
plot shows a charge depletion (red-colored in Figure 3) at selenium, whose shape resembles its
pz orbital, and a charge accumulation
at the gold and carbene (blue-colored), all of which with an approximately
axial symmetry. Therefore, Δρ0 is clearly related
to the σ Se → Au donation.

Figure 3 Isodensity surfaces (±0.003
e/au) for the most relevant Δρk (k = 0–3) of the [(NHC)Au]+···[SeU] bond for complex 1s+.

Δρ1 (ΔE1 = −5.7 kcal/mol) shows a charge accumulation
at selenium
and a depletion at the carbon and nitrogen atoms of selenourea, whereas
no contribution is present at the gold–carbene moiety. Therefore,
this contribution describes the C → Se polarization because
of the formation of the complex, with selenium that becomes more negatively
charged, and the C=Se double bond order decreases (structure
b in Scheme 1), as
confirmed from the abovementioned DFT geometries.

Δρ2 and Δρ3 (ΔEk = −4.1 and −2.9
kcal/mol, respectively) show charge depletion regions at gold, the
shape of which resemble the dxz and dz2 orbitals of the metal, and accumulation
regions at selenium. These contributions can be related to the Au
→ Se back-donation of π and σ symmetry. Even if
the back-donation is generally thought to be with π symmetry,
there are examples of σ back-donation.26

These components can be integrated to obtain a quantitative
estimation
of the electronic fluxes between the fragments upon the formation
of the adduct through the CD analysis: the CD0 curve, obtained
by integrating Δρ0 along the z axis that passes through the gold and selenium nuclei, is always
positive, indicating a net Se → Au charge transfer (Figure 4). CD1 is mainly localized in the region of selenium, coherently with Figure 3. CD2 and
CD3 are negative in the boundary region, indicating a Au
→ Se charge transfer (Figure 4). At the boundary, the curves assume the values (CTk) of 0.384, 0.027, −0.022, and −0.016 e for k going from 0 to 3, respectively.

curves for the most relevant components of the Au–Se
bond in the complex 1s+. Black
dots indicate the z position of the atomic nuclei.
A yellow vertical band indicates the boundary between the [(NHC)Au]+ and SeU fragments.

The Au–C bond can be similarly analyzed (Figure S5, Supporting Information), using [NHC] and [Au(SeU)]+ as fragments (Eoi = −80.8 kcal/mol). Δρ0 (ΔE0 = −50.1 kcal/mol) is associated with
the C → Au σ donation, Δρ1 (ΔE1 = −10.5 kcal/mol) and Δρ3 (ΔE3 = −5.1 kcal/mol)
are associated with the Au → C π back-donation, and Δρ2 (ΔE2 = −8.3 kcal/mol)
with the Au → C σ back-donation. Integrating the four
main contributions leads to CTk = 0.337,
−0.041, −0.038, and −0.037 e for k going from 0 to 3, respectively. The NHC moiety has a slightly lower
σ donation than SeU, but it accepts more back-donation
(−0.116 e) than the latter (−0.038 e).

Now that
the coordinative bonds in the isolated cation are completely
characterized in terms of DCD components, it is possible to study
the effect of a second-sphere HB.

First, 1sClO4 can be fragmented
into [(NHC)Au(SeU)]+ and [ClO4–], in order to study the effect of the anion on the
electron density of the cation. In this case, Eoi is only −27.4 kcal/mol, coherently with the fact
that the HB is not a covalent bond but mostly electrostatic in nature
(Eint = −99.9 kcal/mol). The decomposition
of Eoi leads to two main contributions
Δρ0 and Δρ1 associated
with ΔEk = −8.7 and −7.9
kcal/mol, respectively. All the other contributions count for less
than 1.5 kcal/mol each. Δρ0 is associated with
a polarization of SeU, with the electron density of the
anion that moves toward the amino protons of the cation and the electron
density of selenourea that moves from the amino protons to the nitrogen
atoms (Figure 5). Moreover,
also the C=Se bond is polarized, with a depletion region at
carbon and an accumulation at the selenium atom.

Figure 5 Isodensity surfaces (±0.001
e/au) for Δρ0 of the [(NHC)Au(SeU)]+···[ClO4]− bond for complex 1sClO4.

In other words, as already reported
for the benzoate···SeU···ICF3 system,55 the anion enhances the
anionic character of selenium. Δρ1 describes
a similar contribution and it is reported in the Supporting Information (Figure S6). The effect
of PF6– is similar but smaller (Eoi = −15.7 kcal/mol, Figure S7, Supporting Information), and the accumulation
region at selenium is not visible. A lower threshold is necessary
to make it emerge.

Before analyzing the effect of the anion
on the Au–Se and
Au–C DCD components, it is important to take into account that
the anion deeply modifies the conformation of the ligands, in different
ways if different anions are introduced, as already discussed (Figure 3). To do that, the
NOCV-CD analysis will be performed using the geometries of 1s+ in 1sPF6 and 1sClO4 but obviously
without the anion.

Deleting the anion from the geometry of 1sClO4, the analysis of Δρk (k = 0–3) reveals
that the
change of geometry has a noticeable effect on the qualitative nature
of the NOCV pairs. In fact, for the Au–Se bond, Δρ0 describes again the Se → Au σ donation, but
the π electron of the C–Se bond is also involved (Figure 6). This is likely
because of the different relative orientations between gold and SeU: indeed, the Au–Se–C–N dihedral angle
is 1.18° and 114.9° in 1s+ and 1sClO4, respectively.
In other words, in the latter, the π system of the Se–C
double bond directly faces the gold atom, facilitating the σ
donation from the π(SeC) orbital to the empty orbital of gold.
This contribution does not substitute the p(Se) → Au donation,
but they coexist, as the shape of the negative region at SeU demonstrates. This change is evidenced also by the NBO second-order
perturbation theory interaction energy analysis, according to which
the π(SeC) → Au or σ*(Au–C) orbital interactions
pass from 1.5 to 3.7 kcal/mol passing from 1s+ to 1sClO4.

Figure 6 Isodensity
surfaces (±0.0015 e/au) for the most relevant Δρk (k = 0–3) of the
[(NHC)Au]+···[SeU] bond for
complex 1s+ (at the geometry
that the cation adopts in 1sClO4).

Δρ1 does
not describe anymore the SeU polarization but the polarization
of the whole molecular
system, with both positive and negative regions at selenium and gold.
A more detailed view of Δρ1 is reported in
the Supporting Information (Figure S8),
with a lower threshold.

Δρ2 describes
the Au → Se π
back-donation, from the dyz orbital of
the metal associated to a polarization contribution; finally, Δρ3 describes the Au → Se σ back-donation, from
the dz2 orbital of the metal.

The Δρk functions corresponding
to the analysis of the Au–C bond do not change (from the qualitative
point of view) by using the geometry of the cation in 1sClO4 or 1s+.

As above, the integration of Δρk leads to the quantification of the different contributions
(Table 2), allowing
a comparison among the different situations: for the Au–Se
bond, the CTk values change only marginally
and the largest deviation is 0.017 e for CT1, whereas for
the Au–C bond, CT0 and CT1 increase in
the absolute value with respect to the original geometry and all the
other values undergo small variations.

a At the geometry adopted in 1sClO4 but not considering the anion.

b At the geometry adopted in 1sPF6 but not considering the anion.

Similar considerations can be made
by using the geometry of the
cation in 1sPF6. In this case,
the π(SeC) → Au or σ*(Au–C) orbital interactions
count for 4.5 kcal/mol. In this case, comparing the values of CTk at the two different geometries, the largest
deviations are for CT0 that decreases and CT2 that passes from negative to positive. Likely, in this conformation,
the polarization outweighs the back-donation, making the net flux
from selenium to gold.

Now the electronic effect of the anion
can be separately analyzed
using the fragmentation scheme [(NHC)Au]+···[(SeU)ClO4]−. The analysis of Δρk (k = 0–3) does not
qualitatively differ from that discussed (compare Figures 6 and S9, Supporting Information). It is important to add that no noticeable
accumulation/depletion regions are present at the anion; therefore,
also in this case, the integration of Δρk can be directly related to the DCD and polarization components
of the Au–Se bond. In this case, CTk is 0.395, 0.051, −0.021, and −0.016 for k going from 0 to 3, respectively (Table 3). Comparing these values with those previously
obtained (Table 2),
it can be noted that the Se → Au is larger than previously
obtained (0.384 e). Likely, because the perchlorate interacts with SeU, it makes the selenium atom more negative and more σ
donor. The other values do not change much.

Another interesting
consideration arises comparing the DCD components
of the Au–C bond in the presence and absence of the anion.
CT0 (0.372 e) is lower than previous value (0.382 e), whereas
the back-donation contributions (CT1–3) are larger.
Also, these variations can be ascribed to the polarization of SeU. In fact, the enhancement of the Se → Au donation
makes gold less σ acceptor and more π donor.

In
the case of the weakly coordinating PF6–, the CT0 value for the Au–Se bond is 0.352 e.
It decreases with respect to the previous value (0.369 e), contrarily
to what happens for the perchlorate. This can be because of the different
relative anion/cation orientations (Figure 2). In fact, the hexafluorophosphate is located
over gold, polarizing SeU to a lesser extent, likely
repelling the Au–Se electrons and therefore depressing the
Se → Au donation. Similarly, all the other values of CTk also become smaller or more negative (Table 3).

For the Au–C
bond in the presence of PF6–, all the
CTk values decrease,
again because of the central position of the anion that depresses
all the donations toward gold.

The effect of the anion on the
Au–C and Au–Se DCD
components is only apparently small, as it has been recently demonstrated
that the gold–carbene bond is exceptionally stable and only
few structural modifications are able to effectively modulate the
σ donation and π back-donation.26

It is now possible to compare the experimental and theoretical
results. From one point of view, the increase of KHB between the pairs SeU···X– and [(NHC)Au(SeU)]+···X– is certainly due to more favorable electrostatic contributions,
but the polarization of SeU by the metal fragment (Δρ1 in Figure 3) likely also plays a role, especially in the case of perchlorate,
for which the difference is more pronounced than in the case of PF6–.

The other experimental probe, the 77Se NMR chemical
shift, is certainly linked to all the theoretical parameters illustrated
above (donation/back-donation variations, bond order...) but a deep
understanding is not easy because the theoretical parameters influence
the electron density at selenium in contrasting ways. For instance,
the HB between selenourea and the perchlorate certainly polarizes
the coordinated selenourea (Figure 5), making the electron density around selenium to increase
(a shielding effect can be predicted) with consequent decrease of
the Se–C bond order. On the other hand, the NOCV-CD results
demonstrate that the Se → Au σ donation increases in
the presence of ClO4–, which decreases
the electron density at selenium (a deshielding effect can be predicted).
The two things are coherent with each other, as a more negatively
charged selenium tends to be a better σ donor, but it is impossible
to say a priori which parameter has the larger effect on the 77Se NMR chemical shift. As the experimental result is a small
shielding effect (Δδ = −1 ppm), the former likely
prevails on the latter. In the case of PF6–, the polarization is certainly less important, the Se → Au
σ donation decreases (probably for polarization-induced effects),
and the Au → Se π back-donation increases. The experimental
result is a positive Δδ (+2 ppm). In order to better investigate
this relationship, we recognize that more anions and cations should
be investigated, but the strategy presented here is an adequate starting
point and provides the general framework in which the future results
can be discussed.

A more detailed comparison between the experimental
and computational
data is hampered by the fact that the correlation of an experimentally
accessible parameter with a single DCD component is not easy, even
if not impossible.73−75 For this reason, new molecular systems are currently
under study with the aim to better characterize the interplay between
covalent and noncovalent interactions.

Conclusions
Here,
we present a combined experimental/theoretical study on the
relationship between a second-sphere HB and the DCD bond component
for a gold(I) complex. The experimental results, obtained by 1H or diffusional NMR techniques, quantify the polarization
of selenourea upon the coordination on the metal center and reveals
that the selenourea affinity for the anion approximately doubles up
in terms of association constant. The absolute values of K clearly depend on the basicity of the anion, but the effect is noticeable
using either the noncoordinating PF6– or the more basic ClO4–. The use of
more basic or coordinating anions has been prevented by the acidity
of the selenourea protons which establish an acid–base equilibrium
with the anion, which makes the corresponding NMR peak broaden and
disappear. The 77Se NMR spectroscopy revealed that different
anions induce a different sign for Δδ, positive for PF6– and negative for ClO4–.

From the theoretical point of view, the NOCV-CD analysis
provided
a quantitative analysis of the Au–Se and Au–C coordinative
bonds, in the presence and absence of the anion, revealing that the
latter influences the DCD bond components in many ways: it modifies
the conformation of the ligands, in this case favoring the donation
from the π orbitals of the Se–C bond to the metal and
it polarizes selenourea, making selenium a better σ donor and,
consequently, tends to decrease the Au → carbene donation and
increase the back-donation.

Considering that the Au →
carbene back-donation is poorly
modulated by structural variations of the carbene,26 the results presented here assume a unique relevance and
pave the way for a different way of thinking. The use of external
additives to modulate the DCD components can not only be as effective
as the time-consuming, expensive “ad hoc synthesis”
but also much easier and immediate.

Our laboratory is currently
testing the potential of this strategy
in catalysis and the results will be reported in due time.

Experimental
Section
Materials and Instrumentation
Unless otherwise noted,
all reagents were purchased from commercial sources and used without
further purification. 1PF6 has been synthesized
using the literature method.57 Tetraalkylammonium
salts were purchased, stored in an essicator, and used as received
or synthesized by reaction of tetraalkylammonium hydroxide and the
acid of the desired anion.

1H, 77Se and 13C NMR spectra were recorded with a Bruker “AVANCE
DRX400” spectrometer equipped with a BBFO broadband probe.
Chemical shifts were measured in ppm (δ) from TMS by residual
solvent peaks for 1H and 13C.

PGSE NMR.
1H diffusion NMR measurements were performed by using
the double-stimulated echo sequence with longitudinal eddy current
delay at 298 K without spinning.76 The
dependence of the resonance intensity (I) on a constant waiting time
and on a varied gradient strength G is described
by the following equation  where I is the intensity
of the observed spin echo, I0 is the intensity
of the spin echo in the absence of gradient, Dt is the self-diffusion coefficient, Δ is the delay between
the midpoints of the gradients (0.2 s), δ is the length of the
gradient pulse (4 ms), and γ is the magnetogyric ratio. The
shape of the gradients was rectangular, and their strength G was varied during the experiments.

When necessary,
the experimental data have been fitted through
a two-component equation  where Dt,1 and Dt,2 are the diffusion coefficient of the two
species in mutual exchange and a1 and a2 are the two corresponding weighing factors.

The self-diffusion coefficient, Dt,
was estimated by evaluating the proportionality constant for a sample
of HDO (5%) in D2O (known diffusion coefficients in the
range 274–318 K77) under the exact
same conditions as the samples of interest. The solvent was taken
as an internal standard. The hydrodynamic volume of the species has
been calculated from the experimental value of Dt through the procedure previously described.70

Computational Details
Geometry Optimizations
If not otherwise specified,
all the geometries were optimized with ORCA 4.0.1.2,78,79 using the BP86 functional80 in conjunction
with a triple-ζ quality basis set (def2-TZVP). GGA functional
demonstrated to be reliable for geometry optimizations,58,81 whereas a single-point calculation using the double hybrid B2-PLYP
has been used for the computation of the energies.58 The dispersion corrections were taken into account during
optimization cycles using the Grimme D3-parametrized correction with
Becke–Jonhson damping to the DFT energy.82 All the structures were confirmed to be local energy minima
(no imaginary frequencies).

Energy Decomposition Analysis
The EDA72 allows the decomposition of
the bond energy into physically
meaningful contributions. The interaction energy (Eint) is the difference of energy between the adduct and
the unrelaxed fragments. It can be divided into contributions associated
with the orbital, steric, and dispersion interactions, as shown in eq 1(72) 1  Est is usually
called the steric interaction energy and it is the sum of Eelst, the classical electrostatic interaction
between the unperturbed charge distributions of the fragments (ρA and ρB) at their final positions in the
adduct, and the Pauli repulsion (EPauli) that is the energy change associated with going from ρA + ρB to the antisymmetrized and renormalized
wave function. The decomposition of Est is not possible with ORCA 4.0.1.2. Est comprises the destabilizing interactions between the occupied orbitals
and is responsible for any steric repulsion. Eoi is the contribution arising from allowing the wave function
to relax to the fully converged one, accounting for electron-pair
bonding, charge transfer, and polarization, whereas Edisp is the contribution of the dispersion forces.

Charge
Displacement Function Analysis
The CD function
analysis is based on eq 2.31 Δρ′(x,y,z) is the difference between
the electron density of a complex and that of its noninteracting fragments
placed in the same position as they occupy in the complex. In the
present case, the fragmentation depends on the interaction under examination
and is generally indicated in each case. The function Δq(z) defines, at each point z along a chosen axis, the amount of electron charge that, upon formation
of the bond between the fragments, moves across a plane perpendicular
to the axis through the point z. A positive (negative)
value corresponds to electrons flowing in the direction of decreasing
(increasing) z. Charge accumulates where the slope
of Δq is positive and decreases where it is
negative. 2  

Because in many cases
there is no molecular
symmetry in the systems considered, we make use of the (NOCV):60,83 Δρ′ is built from the occupied orbitals of A
and B, suitably orthogonalized to each other and renormalized (promolecule),
using the “valence operator” (eq 3),84−86 3  where ψi0 is the set of
the occupied Kohn–Sham
orbitals of fragments A and B, mutually orthonormalized, and ψi(AB) is the set
of occupied orbitals of the adduct. The NOCVs can be grouped in pairs
of complementary orbitals (φk, φ–k) corresponding to eigenvalues with
the same absolute value but opposite sign (eq 4). 4  where k numbers
the NOCV
pairs (k = 0 for the largest value of |νk|). In this framework, Δρ′
can be defined as in eq 5. 5  

For each value of k, an energy contribution
associated
with the k-th NOCV pair is given. The most important
ones are listed in the Supporting Information

Now the different Δρk′ can be separately
integrated
using eq 2.33

The NOCV orbital cubes have been manipulated
through the software
“Gabedit”,87 whereas the
electronic density matrices have been manipulated through the suite
of tools “Cubes”.88,89

NBO analysis
has been performed using the NBO6 suite of software.90
