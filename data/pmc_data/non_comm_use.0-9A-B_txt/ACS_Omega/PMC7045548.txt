Cs2CO3 in dimethylformamide
(DMF) is a perfect
combination for the rapid room-temperature synthesis of 3-amino-2-aroyl
benzofuran derivatives from the reaction of 2-hydroxybenzonitriles
and 2-bromoacetophenones in good to excellent yields. Using this one-pot
C–C and C–O bond-forming strategy, we prepared a series
of 3-amino-2-aroyl benzofuran derivatives within a very short time
(10–20 min). This method was also found suitable for gram-scale
synthesis. Benzofurans (3) obtained by this Cs2CO3-mediated methodology were then further explored for
the development of a tunable base- and ligand-free copper-catalyzed N-arylation methodology using arylboronic acids for the
easy access of either mono- or bi-N-aryl derivatives
of aminobenzofurans at ambient temperature. The reaction of 3 with malononitrile in DMF medium under microwave heating
conditions provided highly fluorescent conjugated alkenes and novel
pyridine-fused benzofurans.

Introduction
Benzofuran is an important
fused oxygen heterocycle found in both
natural products and many synthetic products used in drugs, polymers,
and agrochemicals.1 Substituted benzofurans
exhibit numerous medicinal properties such as antifungal,2 antitumour,3 anti-inflammatory,4 antiviral,5 and antineoplastic
activities.6 Considering diverse applications
of benzofuran derivatives, the design and development of novel methods
for their synthesis has remained an important topic in organic synthesis.7 Benzofuran derivatives such as 3-amino-2-aroyl
benzofurans have diverse pharmaceutical applications. For example,
compound A is an anticonvulsant and neurotoxic compound8 and compound B showed inhibition
in tubulin polymerization (Figure 1).9 Similarly, compound C is a potent and selective P2X4 receptor antagonist, which
can be easily prepared from 3-amino-2-aroyl benzofuran derivatives.10

Figure 1 Representative examples of bioactive 3-amino-2-acyl benzofuran
derivatives.

In addition to these applications,
3-amino-2-aroyl benzofurans
are used as starting materials for the preparation of diverse benzofuran-fused
heterocycles having significant medicinal or optoelectronic properties.
Recently, 3-amino-2-aroyl benzofuran has been used as a starting material
under different reaction conditions for the preparation of benzofuran-fused
quinolines11 and pyridines,12 as shown in Scheme 1. The synthesis of 3-amino-2-aroyl benzofuran
derivatives was first reported by Gewald et al. using in situ NaOEt.13 Later, modified methods were developed using
various base and solvent systems. Habermann et al. reported an alternative
method using a polymer-supported base TBD-P (1,5,7-triazabicyclo[4.4.0]dec-5-ene)
in acetone medium under reflux conditions.14

Scheme 1 Reported Methods for the Synthesis of Benzofuran-Fused Heterocycles
Using 3-Amino-2-Aroyl Benzofuran as a Starting Material
K2CO3-mediated two-component
reactions in
acetone medium under reflux conditions with long reaction time (12
h) are also known.15 It is noteworthy to
mention that most of the reported methods suffer from one or the other
limitations such as long reaction time, a two-step process with the
involvement of two bases, harsh reaction conditions, and relatively
low yields. Considering the significance of 3-amino-2-aroyl benzofuran
and its derivatives in both medicinal and organic chemistry, we realized
the scope to develop an efficient, straightforward method for the
one-step preparation of these molecules in good to excellent yields
in a shorter time and at ambient temperature. Cs2CO3 is a versatile reagent in organic synthesis.16 Apart from its basicity, it also acts as a source of carbon
in many
organic transformations.17 Unlike other
metal carbonates, Cs2CO3 shows exceptional reactivity
in polar aprotic solvents such as dimethylformamide (DMF) due to its
high solubility and the lowest degree of solvation and ion pairing
than the ions of analogous alkali-metal salts. Considering these,
most often, this reagent shows better results, which is also known
as the “cesium effect”.18 Recently, Cs2CO3 has been used in various
organic reactions involving C–C, C–N, C–O, and
C–S bond formation.19 In view of
its virtues, we were motivated to explore this reagent for our methodology
for the synthesis of 3-aminobenzofuran derivatives.

In addition
to 3-aminobenzofurans, their N-arylated
derivatives also exhibit diverse medicinal properties.20 Conventionally, N-arylation
of amines is performed using aryl halide in the presence of either
Pd or Cu catalysts at high temperature.21 Chan–Lam coupling using arylboronic acid is an alternative
approach for the C–N bond formation at relatively lower temperature.22 To the best of our knowledge, there is no report
in the literature for the preparation of 3-arylamino-2-aroyl benzofuran
derivatives using the Chan–Lam coupling reaction. Recently,
Romagnoli et al. prepared novel 3-arylaminobenzofuran derivatives
by a two-step reaction involving aryl iodides using Pd(OAc)2, BINAP, and Cs2CO3, in a toluene medium at
100 °C for the C–N bond-forming step.20 Similarly, Wang et al. reported a Pd-catalyzed one-pot
three-component reaction involving isonitriles, 2-iodophenols, and
2-bromoacetophenones for the synthesis of 3-aminoalkyl/aryl-2-benzoyl
benzofurans.23 In continuation of our quest
for developing new and improved methodologies, we wanted to prepare N-arylated derivatives of our 3-aminobenzofuran derivatives
by an alternative and efficient method using a readily available cheaper
catalyst and at ambient temperature. Copper salts are relatively cheaper
and readily available catalysts for the N-arylation
reactions using either aryl halides or arylboronic acids.24 Recently, we have developed a CuCl2-catalyzed domino reaction in DMF medium for the one-pot synthesis
of pyrimidine-fused quinolines.25 In continuation
of our work on the development of novel methodologies, herein, we
report a Cs2CO3-mediated highly efficient methodology
for the preparation of 3-amino-2-aroyl benzofuran derivatives from
the readily available starting materials at room temperature (rt).
We also report a base- and ligand-free copper-catalyzed room-temperature
C–N bond-forming methodology for the easy access of mono- and
bi-N-arylated aminobenzofuran derivatives using arylboronic
acids. Finally, our two-component benzofuran derivatives were further
explored for the synthesis of a highly fluorescent novel alkene and
a benzofuran-fused pyridine in the presence of Cs2CO3 as a base under microwave heating conditions, as shown in Scheme 2.

Scheme 2 This Work
Results and Discussion
In continuation
of our work on the synthesis of fused heterocycles,
initially, we tried to prepare the benzofuran derivative 3a from the reaction of 2-hydroxybenzonitrile (1a) and
2-bromoacetophenone (2a) in DMF medium in the presence
of Cs2CO3 (1.0 equiv) as a base. Within 12 h
of room-temperature stirring, this reaction provided our desired benzofuran
derivative 3a in a good yield. Compound 3a was fully characterized by 1H and 13C NMR
spectroscopies as well as by recording high-resolution mass spectrometry
(HRMS). Interestingly, by increasing the amount of Cs2CO3 to 2.0 equiv, we observed a drastic change in the rate of
the reaction; the reaction completed within 10 min, and the corresponding
desired benzofuran derivative 3a was obtained in 92%
yield (Table 1, entry
2). This exciting result prompted us to investigate the effect of
other metal carbonates as well as the screening of solvents in this
reaction.

a Reaction conditions: 1a (0.5 mmol), 2a (0.5 mmol), and the solvent
(2.0 mL)
stirred at the indicated time and temperature.

b Isolated yield.

c The ratio was determined from the 1H NMR spectra of
crude product(s).

Using
2.0 equiv of Na2CO3 in place of cesium
carbonate and keeping DMF as a solvent, the same reaction provided
a mixture of two products 3a and 3a′ (Table 1, entry 3).
Likewise, using K2CO3 (2.0 equiv) in DMF medium,
a mixture of products 3a and 3a′ was
obtained from the room-temperature reaction even after 2 h stirring
(Table 1, entry 4).
However, performing this reaction at 100 °C in the presence of
K2CO3 in DMF medium provided only our desired
cyclic product 3a. We also screened the organic base
Et3N for this model reaction at room temperature. Interestingly,
even after 1 h, we observed acyclic intermediate 3a′ as the major product for this reaction. It is noteworthy to mention
that in this reaction, the stoichiometry of a base is very important
for the efficient synthesis of our desired benzofurans. For example,
the reaction in the presence of 1.0 equiv Cs2CO3 in DMF medium provided us exclusively acyclic intermediate 3a′ within 10 min (Table 1, entry 7). For the efficient conversion,
2.0 equiv of Cs2CO3 is required for this transformation.
After having these results, we also wanted to find the best solvent
for this reaction. Different solvents such as dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO),
MeOH, Me2CO, tetrahydrofuran (THF), and H2O
were screened using 2.0 equiv of a base. Protic solvents such as methanol
and water provided only acyclic product 3a′ even
after long reaction time under refluxed conditions. On the other hand,
aprotic polar solvents such as acetone and THF provided our desired
product 3a using Cs2CO3 as a base
under reflux conditions. From this optimization table, it is evident
that 2.0 equiv of Cs2CO3 in DMF medium provided
the best result in the shortest time. Thus, 2.0 equiv Cs2CO3 in 2.0 mL DMF at room temperature was considered as
the optimum reaction condition.

After having this optimized
reaction condition, next, we explored
the substrate scope and generality of this method by varying 2-hydroxybenzonitriles
and 2-bromoacetophenones. A wide variety of 2-bromoacetophenone derivatives
having −CH3, −OCH3, −CN,
−NO2, −F, −Cl, and −Br at different
positions of the aryl ring were tested, and corresponding 3-amino-2-aroylbezofurans
were obtained in good to very good yields.

Similarly, the variability
of 2-hydroxybenzonitrile derivatives
was also checked using 2-bromoacetophenone derivatives having −F
and −Br substituents and, in these cases, also corresponding
products were obtained in good yields, and the results are summarized
in Table 2. All of
the products were fully characterized using IR, 1H, and 13C NMR spectroscopies as well as by HRMS.

of 3-Amino-2-Aroyl Benzofuran Derivativesa,b

min.

We also tried this methodology at
a 5.0 mmol scale to check the
feasibility of gram-scale synthesis of 3-amino-2-aroyl benzofuran
derivatives. Compounds 3a, 3d, and 3g were synthesized in a 5.0 mmol scale reaction, and in all
of these reactions, good to very good yields were observed (Scheme 3).

Scheme 3 Gram-Scale Synthesis
of 3-Amino-2-Aroyl Benzofuran Derivatives
After developing this Cs2CO3-mediated efficient
methodology for the preparation of 3-amino-2-aroyl benzofurans, next,
we aimed to explore these products for the preparation of N-aryl derivatives. In continuation of our work on C–N
bond-forming reactions, initially, we tried the reaction of 3a and phenylboronic acid (4a). This two-component
reaction in the absence of any catalysts in DMF medium provided only
a trace amount of the mono-N-arylated product 5a (Table 3, entry 1). Next, the same model reaction was tried in the presence
of 10 mol % Cu(OAc)2, keeping the same solvent DMF as the
reaction medium at room temperature. Within 12 h, our desired mono-N-arylated product 5a was observed as the major
product (45% yield) along with 5% bi-N-arylated product 6a (Table 3, entry 2). Next, we performed the same reaction for a longer time
(24 h) in DMF medium at room temperature. In this case, we observed
better results in terms of the yield obtained (Table 3, entry 3). Interestingly, by increasing
the catalyst loading up to 1.0 equiv and 4a (1.2 equiv)
within 8 h, corresponding mono- and bi-N-arylated
products were obtained in good yields (Table 3, entry 4). Both these products were fully
characterized by 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopies
as well as by HRMS. Interestingly, when this model reaction was tried
at room temperature in the presence of 10 mol % Cu(OAc)2 in methanol as a medium, a better and selective result (65% yield)
for the desired mono-N-arylated product 5a was observed (Table 3, entry 5).

a Reaction conditions:
Reactions were
performed on a 0.5 mmol scale of 3a.

b Isolated yield.

Next, we increased the amount of phenylboronic acid
to 1.2 equiv,
keeping all other reaction parameters the same in methanol medium.
Under this condition, an improved yield (71%) of the desired mono-N-arylated product 5a was observed along with
5% of the bi-N-arylated product 6a.
It is noteworthy to mention that replacing methanol with dichloromethane
as the reaction medium and keeping phenylboronic acid as 1.2 equiv
provided the best yield in the shortest time (Table 3, entry 7). Among all of the screened solvents,
dichloromethane was found as the best solvent for the mono-N-arylation reaction of 3a.

After having
this successful result, we also wanted to find an
optimum reaction condition for the preparation of the bi-N-arylated product by varying the amount of the catalyst, solvent,
and phenylboronic acid. The reaction of 3a with phenylboronic
acid (1.5 equiv) in the presence of 15 mol % Cu(OAc)2 in
methanol medium within 14 h with room-temperature stirring provided
a higher amount of the bi-N-arylated product (6a, 35%) along with 30% of 5a (Table 3, entry 8). Finally, the optimum
condition for the bi-N-arylation was observed in
the presence of 2.5 equiv of phenylboronic acid and 20 mol % Cu(OAc)2 in methanol medium at room-temperature stirring for 15 h
(Table 3, entry 10).
From this optimization table, we realized that 1.2 equiv of arylboronic
acid in the presence of 10 mol % Cu(OAc)2 in dichloromethane
as the solvent at room-temperature stirring under open flask conditions
for 8–10 h gives the maximum yield of the mono-N-arylated benzofuran derivative, and for the N,N-biarylated product, the optimum yield was obtained using
2.5 equiv of arylboronic acid, 20 mol % of the catalyst, and a longer
reaction time (15 h) in methanol medium.

Next, using our optimized
reaction conditions, the scope of mono-N-arylation
of aminobenzofurans was checked, and the results
are summarized in Table 4. Initially, 3a was reacted with various phenylboronic
acids having electron-donating groups such as 4-Me, 4-tBu, and 4-OMe and the corresponding mono-N-arylated products 5b–d were obtained in good yields. Similarly, bulky naphthylboronic acid
was also found suitable for the reaction.

Table 4 Substrate
Scope for the Mono-N-Arylation of Aminobenzofuransa
a Conditions: 1 (0.5
mmol.), 2 (0.6 mmol), Cu(OAc)2 (10 mol %)
in dichloromethane (DCM) (2.0 mL), room temperature, air, 6–10
h.

Interestingly, 4-bromo
phenylboronic acid having two reactive sites
for C–N bond formation on reaction with 3a under
the optimized reaction conditions provided selectively the desired
product 5f in good yield. Under similar reaction conditions,
the reaction of 3a with arylboronic acid having electron-withdrawing
groups such as 4-CF3 provided the corresponding mono-N-arylated product 5g relatively in less yield
(69%) and took a longer reaction time.

We also observed that
ortho-disubstituted phenylboronic acid like
2-fluoro-6-iodophenyl boronic acid is not suitable to react with 3-amino-2-benzoyl
benzofuran under the optimized reaction conditions to provide our
expected product 5h, which may be due to the electron-withdrawing
nature of both −F and −I substituents as well as steric
reasons. Next, to check the variability of 3-amino-2-aroyl benzofurans,
various aminobenzofuran derivatives were reacted with phenylboronic
acid and corresponding mono-N-arylated products 5i–l were prepared in good yields. It
is noteworthy to mention that only under the given reaction conditions,
C–N bond formation products (5k and 5l) were observed from the aminobenzofuran derivatives having bromo
substituents and we did not observe any Suzuki-type coupling products.
All of the products were fully characterized by recording melting
points, 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopies, and HRMS.
In addition, to confirm the structure of these products unambiguously,
we recorded a single-crystal X-ray diffraction (XRD) of 5j, shown in Figure 2.

Figure 2 Single-Crystal XRD of 5j (CCDC 1958974).

We also checked the chemoselectivity of the reaction of 3g and 4a in the presence of copper and palladium
catalysts.
Using our standard copper-catalyzed method, we observed the corresponding
mono-N-arylated product 5k. On the other
hand, in the presence of a catalytic amount of palladium acetate and
potassium carbonate as a base in methanol medium under reflux conditions,
the reaction of 3g and 4a provided the Suzuki
coupling product 7a instead of mono-N-arylation (Scheme 4).

Scheme 4 Chemoselective Arylation of 3g in the Presence
of Copper
and Palladium Catalysts
After preparing these mono-N-arylated derivatives,
next, we focused our attention on the preparation of N,N-biarylated derivatives using 2.5 equiv of arylboronic
acids and 20 mol % of the copper catalyst in methanol medium. Using
this biarylation strategy, we synthesized compounds 6a, 6c, 6d, and 6i by varying
boronic acid derivatives as well as the 3-amino-2-aroyl benzofurans,
and the results are summarized in Table 5.

a Reaction conditions: 3 (0.5 mmol) and 4 (1.25 mmol) in 3.0 mL of MeOH

stirring for 14–15 h.

b Isolated yield.

We also
tried to prepare mono-N-arylated aminobenzofuran 5a from the one-pot three-component reaction. For this, a
mixture of 2-hydroxybenzonitrile (1.0 mmol), 2-bromoacetophenone (1.0
mmol), and phenylboronic acid (1.2 mmol) was transferred to a 25.0
mL round-bottom flask. To this mixture, 2.0 equiv of Cs2CO3 and 1.0 equiv of Cu(OAc)2 were added and
stirred at room temperature. Within 8 h, corresponding products 5a (69%) along with 5% 6a were observed (Scheme 5).

Scheme 5 One-Pot Three-Component
Synthesis of 5a and 6a in DMF Medium
After having these successful results, we turned
our attention
to utilize our 3-amino-2-aroyl benzofurans for the preparation of
highly conjugated alkenes 8a and 8c by reaction
with malononitrile (Scheme 6). For this, initially, compound 3a was prepared
from the reaction of 1a and 2a using our
standard reaction conditions in DMF medium at room temperature. Microwave
heating is an efficient strategy for organic synthesis as well as
for the drug discovery process.26 Thus,
we turned our attention to use this technique for the condensation
reaction of 3a and malononitrile. A mixture of malononitrile
(1.5 equiv) and 1.0 equiv of Cs2CO3 was added
to the in situ generated 3a in DMF, and the resultant
mixture was heated using a microwave reactor under sealed conditions
for 30 min keeping the temperature at 130 °C. Under these conditions,
we obtained two products 8a (25%) and 9a (20%). Compounds 8a and 9a were fully
characterized by spectroscopic analysis.

Scheme 6 One-Pot Two-Step
Synthesis of Tricyclic Benzofuran-Fused Pyridines
and Highly Conjugated Fluorescent Alkenes under Microwave Conditions
We also tried to increase the yield of 8a using different
bases like DBU, K2CO3, KOH as well as by screening
different solvents like MeOH, EtOH, and DMSO, but in all of these
cases, the yield of the corresponding alkene did not improve. Compound 9a is a novel benzofuran-fused pyridine derivative formed
by the intramolecular cyclization of a highly conjugated alkene 8a.

Next, using a similar one-pot reaction, in situ 3c was generated and on the reaction with malononitrile under
the similar
reaction conditions, the corresponding alkene 8c was
obtained in 22% along with a trace amount of 9c. Interestingly,
we found that both the alkenes exhibit significant fluoresce properties
under the visible and UV lights.

Fluorescence properties of
the solutions of 3a and 8a as well as 3c and 8c under the
daylight and UV (short and long wavelengths) are shown in Figure 3. We also measured
photophysical properties of 3a and 3c along
with their corresponding alkenes 8a and 8c in DMSO solution at room temperature using quininesulfate dihydrate
as the fluorescence reference standard. Considering the poor solubility
of 8a and 8c, we could not study UV–visible
and fluorescence properties of these molecules in other solvents.
We observed very good quantum yields Øf = 0.57 for 8a and Øf = 0.68 for 8c in DMSO
medium. However, their corresponding starting materials 3a and 3c did not show fluorescence properties (Figure 4). The observed results
are summarized in Table 6.

The proposed reaction
pathway for the formation of 3-amino-2-aroyl
benzofuran, the corresponding alkene on reaction with malononitrile,
and the benzofuran-fused pyridine is shown in Scheme 7. One equiv of Cs2CO3 is required for the formation of phenoxide of 1a, which
later reacts with 2a to form the acyclic intermediate 3a′. Another 1 equiv of a base is required for the
preparation of the carbanion intermediate P, which undergoes
intramolecular cyclization to give Q. Finally, the desired
product 3a forms by tautomerization of Q. The formation of alkene 8a takes place by the Knoevenagel-type
condensation between 3a and malononitrile in the presence
of Cs2CO3 as a base. Considering the presence
of both the electrophilic site −CN and the nucleophilic site
−NH2 in the same molecule of 8a, in
the presence of a base and heating conditions, it further undergoes
intramolecular cyclization to provide the fused pyridine 9a. Similarly, the proposed reaction pathway for the copper-catalyzed N-arylation of 3-amino-2-aroyl benzofurans is shown in Scheme 8. The role of oxygen
in this copper-catalyzed N-arylation reaction was
investigated by performing a reaction of 3a and phenylboronic
acid 4a in the absence of oxygen (under a nitrogen environment),
and we found a drastic decrease in the yield obtained.

Scheme 7 Proposed
Mechanism for the Formation of 3a, 8a, and 9a
Scheme 8 Proposed Mechanism for the N-Arylation of 3a
Similarly, the reaction of 3a with 4a in the presence of 2.0 equiv of TEMPO did not show any change in
the yield of 5a. Thus, we ruled out the possibility of
having a mechanism by radical generation. Based on the literature
reports,26−29 as well as on the basis of our above observation, we have proposed
the most probable mechanism for the copper-catalyzed N-arylation reaction involving T, U, and V as intermediates (Scheme 8).

Conclusions
In summary, we developed
an efficient methodology for the rapid
synthesis of 3-amino-2-aroyl benzofuran derivatives by the reaction
of 2-hydroxybenzonitriles and 2-bromoacetophenone in the presence
of Cs2CO3 as a base within a very short reaction
time. The advantages of this protocol are (1) the use of cheap and
commercially available substrates, (2) a short reaction time, (3)
a room-temperature cascade reaction involving C–C and C–O
bond formation in one pot, (4) high yields, (5) a wide substrate scope,
and (6) easy purification of products. We also developed a novel and
efficient, ligand- and base-free copper(II)-catalyzed room-temperature
methodology for the selective N-arylation of 3-amino-2-aroyl
benzofurans using arylboronic acids as a coupling partner. This method
is also a versatile method with a wide substrate scope and can be
tuned to achieve bi-N-arylated products. In addition
to these, we reported a one-pot three-component reaction in the presence
of a stoichiometric amount of Cs2CO3 and of
Cu(OAC)2 in DMF medium for the synthesis of an N-arylated aminobenzofuran derivative directly. Finally,
we prepared novel highly fluorescent alkenes and benzofuran-fused
aminopyridine from the reaction of malononitrile and 3-amino-2-aroyl
benzofurans in the presence of Cs2CO3 as a base
and microwave heating.

Experimental Section
General Information
All reagents and solvents were
procured from TCI chemicals, Sigma-Aldrich, Alfa Aesar, or Rankem
and were used without further purification. The progress of the reaction
was monitored by thin-layer chromatography (TLC). A PerkinElmer Fourier
transform infrared instrument was used for recording IR spectra in
the attenuated total reflectance (ATR) mode, and absorption is shown
in cm–1. A Bruker 400 MHz NMR instrument was used
for recording NMR spectra. 1H NMR (400 MHz) and 13C NMR (100 MHz) spectra were recorded in either CDCl3 or
DMSO-d6 solvent at 25 °C. Chemical
shift (in ppm) values are reported using tetramethylsilane (δ
= 0) as an internal standard in CDCl3 (δ = 7.26)
or DMSO-d6 (δ = 2.50) as the solvent.
The following abbreviations were used to define multiplicities: s
= singlet; d = doublet; t = triplet; m = multiplet; dd: doublet of
doublets; td: triplet of doublets; brs: broad singlet. Coupling constants
(J) are in Hz. A Bruker Impact HD mass spectrometer
[Impact HD UHR-TOF, electrospray ionization (ESI) with the positive
ion mode] and an Agilent 6545 quadrupole time-of-flight (Q-TOF) mass
spectrometer were used for HRMS analysis of all of the products. Microwave
heating was performed under sealed conditions using a Biotage initiator
microwave reactor from Upsala, Sweden, having an inbuilt infrared
(IR) external surface temperature sensor. Melting points were recorded
using an SRS EZ-Melt automated melting point apparatus by capillary
methods without correction.

Typical Experimental Procedure
for the Synthesis of 5a
A mixture of (3-aminobenzofuran-2-yl)(phenyl)methanone 3a (0.5 mmol) and phenylboronic acid 4a (0.6
mmol) in 2.0 mL of dichloromethane and 10 mol % Cu(OAc)2 was stirred in a 10 mL round-bottom flask at room temperature. The
progress of the reaction was monitored by TLC. After completion of
the reaction, the solvent was removed by the rota vapor and the crude
product was purified by column chromatography (hexane/ethyl acetete,
99:1). The purified product was characterized by NMR spectroscopy,
electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS), and IR techniques.
Using a similar procedure, we prepared all other products given in Table 3.

Typical Experimental Procedure
for the Synthesis of 6a
A mixture of (3-aminobenzofuran-2-yl)
(phenyl)methanone 3a (0.5 mmol), phenylboronic acid 4a (1.25 mmol),
and 10 mol% Cu(OAc)2 in 2.0 mL of methanol was placed in
a 10.0 mL round-bottom flask and stirred at room temperature. The
progress of the reaction was monitored by TLC. After completion of
the reaction, the solvent was removed by a rota vapor and the crude
product was purified by column chromatography (hexane/ethyl acetate,
99:1). The purified product was fully characterized by NMR, ESI-MS,
and IR techniques. Using a similar procedure, we prepared all other
products given in Table 5.
