In the current work, a detailed exploration on the cleaning
effect of intrinsic oxide existing at the GaAs/HfYO interface by using
an atomic-layer-deposition-derived trimethylaluminum (ALD TMA) precursor
as functions of TMA pulse cycles and postannealing temperature has
been evaluated via X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS) measurements
and electrical characterization. According to XPS analyses, it can
be noted that the intrinsic As oxides, Ga oxides, and As0 are effectively reduced from the HYO/GaAs gate stack after ALD TMA
treatment with 20 pulse cycles. Meanwhile, optimized electrical parameters,
such as the largest permittivity (k), the lowest
hysteresis, and the minimum leakage density (Jg), have also been obtained for the HfYO/GaAs gate stack with
20 pulse cycles of ALD TMA. Based on the optimized pulse cycles of
20 ALD TMA, postannealing temperature-dependent interface quality
and electrical performance of GaAs-based devices based on the HfYO/GaAs
gate stack have also been investigated. The HfYO/GaAs/Al metal-oxide
semiconductor capacitor annealed at 300 °C with optimized pulse
cycles of 20 displays the greatest dielectric constant of 38, the
minimum Jg of 3.28 × 10–6 A cm–2, and a small hysteresis of 0.01 V. Meanwhile,
the leakage current transport mechanism at low temperature (77–327
K) has been discussed systematically.

1 Introduction
With the development
of Si-based integrated circuits,
the traditional SiO2-based complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor
field effect transistor (CMOSFET) devices have reached limited scaling.
Thus, much efforts have been
devoted to the investigation of HfO2-based high-k gate dielectrics due to its wide band gap, high refractive
index, high thermal stability, and excellent chemical properties.1−5 However, lower crystallization temperature
and smaller permittivity make it incompatible for future high-performance
CMOS devices. To increase the dielectric constant and the crystallization
temperature, rare earth elements, such as Y, Dy, and Gd, have been
incorporated into HfO2, and some optimized performance
has been observed.6−8 Based
on our previous publication, it has been detected that incorporating
Y into HfO2 can increase the crystallization temperature
and decrease oxygen vacancies as well as reduce the interfacial defects,
therefore reducing the leakage current and improving the dielectric
interfacial quality.9 However, due to the
introduction of high-k gate dielectrics, the electron
mobility of MOSFET devices degrades inevitably, resulting from the
influence of the Coulomb and phonon scatterings at the interface,
which would definitively decrease the speed of the CMOS devices.10 As a result, III–V compound semiconductors
with high mobility are being investigated as one of the promising
technology boosters to enhance MOSFET performance. Among III–V
semiconductors, more attention has been paid to the investigation
of GaAs-based channel materials for continuing the scaling of MOSFETs
devices due to its larger band gap, higher breakdown field, and higher
carrier mobility than other candidates.11−13 However, due to the existence
of native oxides, GaAs are likely to form extrinsic defects attributed
to the high interface state density (Dit). The high Dit associated with the dielectric/III–V
interface causes Fermi-level pinning at the midgap and large capacitance
frequency dispersion, which leads to the degraded electrical performance.14,15 Additionally, the oxygen atoms in high-k gate dielectrics
can diffuse easily into the substrate, leading to the formation of
a low-k interfacial layer and increased oxygen vacancies
between high-k and the GaAs substrate. It is reported
that the existing native oxides (As2O3, As2O5, Ga2O3) and element of
As on the GaAs surface directly attribute
to the higher Dit.16 To realize GaAs-based MOSFETs with high performance, passivating
the interface chemistry of GaAs before high-k gate
dielectrics deposition has been recently investigated to overcome
fermi-level pinning. Recently, numerous surface-passivation methods
for III–V substrates upon gate stack deposition, including
chemical cleaning, deposition of the interfacial passivation layer,
and nitridation treatment, have been adopted and proved to control
and reduce the GaAs interfacial intrinsic oxides. For chemical cleaning
treatment, diluted hydrofluoric acid, ammonia, and sulfur ammonia
solutions have been used, and dangling bonds of the GaAs surface will
be passivated effectively, reducing the possibility of oxygen adsorbing
on the substrate surface.16,17 By introducing the interfacial
passivation layer, improved interface quality at the high-k/GaAs interface has been detected.18−21 Several studies
have investigated the interface chemistry of III–V semiconductors
passivated by atomic-layer deposition (ALD) precursors and demonstrated
improved performance. As one of the ALD precursors, trimethylaluminum
(TMA) is reactive and can eliminate the native oxides by the self-cleaning
(SC) effect.22−26 On the basis
of the previous observations, it can be seen that the first interaction
on the surface of GaAs by TMA passivation is not self-limiting but
self-cleaning effects, which can remove the native oxides. In some
investigations, it was observed that after the first ALD cycle, the
surface interaction stops and the formation of a 1 nm-thick Al2O3 passivation layer was detected.27−29 By calculation, ligand-exchange
and charge-transfer routes have been confirmed to be effective to
remove GaAs surface arsenic oxide.30 In
addition, by placing the GaAs substrate under a nitrogen or ammonia
atmosphere and annealing to form the interfacial passivation layer,
nitridation treatment would usefully restrain further oxidation of
the GaAs substrate.31,32

In the current work, Y-doped
HfO2 (HYO) gate dielectrics has been selected to reduce
the oxygen vacancies and suppress the leakage density. Since sulfur
passivation has been proved to be effective in controlling the interface
chemistry,33,34 combining sulfur passivation and other passivation
methods can be a great choice. In the current work, to reduce the
interface native oxide and prevent oxidation as well as to decrease
the surface defect density, GaAs wafers were passivated by diluted
HBr and (NH4)2S solutions. Then, different cycles
of TMA were introduced to passivate the GaAs substrate and decrease
the surface mutual diffusion. Finally, the as-processed wafers were
transferred to the chamber system for HYO deposition. Postdeposition
annealing (PDA) under a vacuum atmosphere for Al/HYO/TMA/GaAs MOS
devices was performed to obtain the preferable electrical properties.
The effect of different pulse cycles of the ALD TMA precursor and
postdeposition annealing temperature on the interface chemistry and
electrical properties of HYO/TMA/GaAs gate stacks has been investigated
systematically.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Interface
Chemistry Analyses of HYO/TMA/GaAs Gate Stacks
X-ray photoemission
spectroscopy (XPS) characterizations were performed to analyze the
interface chemistry of HYO/TMA/GaAs gate stacks with different TMA
pulse cycles. All of the collected XPS data were calibrated accurately
by a C 1s peak (284.6 eV). Figure S1 displays
the survey spectra of S1, S2, and S3 samples
with the binding energy ranging from 0 to 1300 eV, where S1, S2, and
S3 refer to 15, 20, and 25 TMA pulse cycles of the TMA precursor,
respectively. As shown in Figure S1a, only
Hf, Y, O, Ga, As, and C are observed, suggesting that the films are
free of some other impurities and that HYO gate dielectrics has been
obtained successfully. However, the Al component is not observed from
the survey spectra owing to its low concentration. Figure S1b presents the high-resolution Al 2p spectra clearly
as a function of the TMA pulse cycle. Based on Figure S1b, it can be seen that Al exists in all of the samples.
Moreover, the Al 2p XPS peak centered at 74 eV has been observed,
representing the formation of the Al2O3 passivation
layer, and the slight increase of the Al 2p peak intensity is accompanied
with the increase of TMA pulse cycles. As a result, it can be concluded
that the generation of Al-related compounds has been proved by ALD
TMA pretreatment on the surface of GaAs.

To evaluate the cleaning
effect of the ALD TMA precursor, the interface chemistry of HYO/GaAs
gate stacks as a function of TMA pulse cycles has been investigated
systematically. Figure 1 demonstrates the Ga 2p and As 3d XPS spectra for three samples by
measuring the HYO/TMA/GaAs gate stacks each. The displayed Ga 2p XPS
spectra in Figure 1a are decomposed into four peaks centered at binding energies of
1117.68, 1118.01, 1118.58, and 1119.17 eV, which can be attributed
to Ga–As, Ga–S, Ga2O, and Ga2O3 bonding states, respectively. For three samples, no obvious
change in the intensities of the Ga–S bond has been observed
after TMA treatment. However, it can be obviously seen that the Ga
oxides’ peak intensities of sample S2 (20 cycles of TMA) have
a substantial reduction and those of samples S1 and S3 with 15 and
25 TMA pulse cycles increase relatively, which mainly results from
the fact that the ALD TMA precursor with 20 pulse cycles can suppress
the formation of Ga oxides. Thus, the self-cleaning (SC) effect with
respect to the reduction in Ga oxides during 20 TMA pulse cycles has
been detected clearly, which can be attributed to the ligand-exchange
reaction between the metal precursor and native oxides. According
to our previous investigation, it can be concluded that the reduction
in Ga–O bonds can be explained by the following chemical reaction35,36 1  The TMA precursor depletes part of gallium
oxides and leads to the production of some volatile substances. If
the supplied TMA precursor is not enough, much more gallium oxides
still exist on the surface of GaAs due to the inadequate ligand-exchange
reaction. When the pulse cycles for TMA increase from 20 to 25, the
observed increase in Ga oxides can be due to the conversion of As
oxides into Ga oxides described by the following possible chemical
reaction mechanism 2   3  This abovementioned thermal conversion is
conductive to the further accumulation of GaOx on the surface of GaAs. As a result, it provides sufficient energy
for the underlying Ga species to diffuse through the AlOx overlayer formed between TMA and native oxides.

Figure 1 Ga 2p (a), As 3d (b), and O 1s (c) XPS spectra of S1,
S2, and S3 as a function of TMA pulse cycles.

Figure 1b shows the
As 3d XPS spectra for S1, S2, and S3 samples as functions of TMA pulse
cycles. The six deconvoluted peaks are represented as Hf 5p1/2 (∼39.11 eV), As–Ga (∼40.10 eV), As0 (∼41.06 eV), As1+ (As2O, ∼43.61
eV), As3+ (As2O3, ∼44.57 eV),
and As5+ (As2O5, ∼45.39 eV).
It is observed that the intensities of As0, As1+, As3+, and As5+ oxides reduce from S1 to S2
and increase from S2 to S3, indicating a similar trend with Ga 2p
XPS spectra. It is obvious that ALD TMA with the SC effect also helps
reduce AsOx and As0 and suppress
these intrinsic impurities effectively. Peculiarly, the 20 TMA pulse
cycles have an obvious scavenging effect on As0 and arsenic
oxides compared with 15 and 25 pulse cycles. In addition, due to the
high affinity of Ga–O bonds, more As–As bonds are formed
on the surface. On the basis of the ligand-exchange theory, arsenic
oxides react with TMA following the formula 4   5  which can reduce
As3+ and As5+ and create volatile gases. For
short TMA pulse cycles, some native oxides covering the surface of
GaAs will be consumed via the ligand-exchange reaction. One of the
possible mechanisms of the SC effect is the reaction of TMA with diffused
Ga and As species, and this process continues until these native oxides
can no longer be available.37,38 This may be one of the
important factors to understand the ALD TMA SC mechanism for a GaAs
surface processed by only TMA pulse cycles but without water or oxygen.
For longer TMA pulse cycles, the formed Al2O3 prevents the consumption of As oxides, and only suitable Al2O3-layer thickness is beneficial to the GaAs surface. Figure 1c displays TMA-pulse-cycle-dependent
O 1s XPS spectra of the three samples. Four fitted subpeaks, attributed
to Hf–Y–O, Al–O, Ga–O, and As–O
components, are detected for all of the samples. The same reduction
trend in Ga–O and As–O intensities is also observed
for the S2 sample, suggesting the suppressed growth of the interfacial
layer. Therefore, it can be inferred that a suitable TMA pulse cycle
can make the scavenging effect on As or Ga oxides.

As shown
in Figure 2, the Hf
4f and Y 3d XPS spectra of three samples have been investigated as
a function of TMA pulse cycles. For Hf 4f XPS spectra demonstrated
in Figure 2a, typical
Hf 4f XPS spectra with spin–orbit doublets have been found
for all of the samples. Compared with S1 and S3, there is a slight
shift of the Hf 4f peak to the lower binding energy for the S2 sample,
and the same trend has happened to Y 3d XPS spectra shown in Figure 2b, which can be attributed
to the difference of the atom radius between Y and Hf elements and
the change in the chemical state of Hf and Y elements. In addition,
the shift in binding energies of Hf 4f and Y 3d spectra related to
the TMA pulse cycles indicates that Fermi-level shifting toward a
flat band condition occurs.39

XPS spectra of S1, S2,
and S3 samples as a function of TMA pulse cycles.

On
account of the XPS investigations,
it can be concluded that the arsenic oxide, element arsenic, and gallium
oxide can be fruitfully reduced on the HYO/GaAs interface while introducing
20 pulse cycles in the ALD TMA precursor.

2.2 Electrical Properties of HYO/TMA/GaAs Gate
Stacks
The double-sweep C–V typical characteristic curves for Al/HYO/GaAs capacitors
as a function of TMA pulse cycles measured at high frequency are shown
in Figure 3a. As we
know, the effect from the interface state of the MOS capacitor can
be avoided by measuring the C–V curves at high frequency (1 MHz).30 From Figure 3a, it can be seen
that compared with S1 and S3, a higher accumulation capacitance (Cox) and good saturation region have been observed
for the S2 sample, indicating the improved interface quality and the
reduction of Ga/As oxides when using 20 TMA pulse cycles. Due to the
existing SC effect for the ALD TMA precursor, the formed Al2O3 passivation layer with the blocking role will prevent
the diffusion of Ga/As oxides and suppress the formation of the interface
layer on the GaAs surface. In addition, the smaller and negligible
hysteresis voltage (ΔVfb) than those
of S1 and S3 has been detected for the S2 sample, implying fewer slow
states in the dielectric and near/at the interface due to the reduction
of Ga and As oxides in the S2 sample with 20 TMA pulse cycles. The
dielectric constants (k) are calculated to be 36.1,
38.3, and 36.7 for S1, S2, and S3 samples, respectively. It can be
seen that with the increase in the ALD TMA pulse cycle from 15 to
20, an obvious increased dielectric constant was observed, which can
be attributed to the reduction of gallium and arsenic oxides and the
suppressed low-k layer. However, there is a slight
reduction in k for the S3 sample, which results from
the formation of a low-k Al2O3 passivation layer. The extracted flat band voltage (Vfb) values are 1.91, 1.35, and 1.80 V for S1, S2, and
S3 samples, respectively. The shift in Vfb toward the positive direction implies the existence of negative
oxide charges in HYO films and the introduced electronegative S2– from the (NH4)2S passivation
solution. It can be seen that after TMA pretreatment with different
pulse cycles, C–V curves
for S1 and S2 have negative shifting in Vfb compared with S1, which can result from the reduced oxygen vacancies
or the negative charges at the interface layer. For S2, the observed
smallest ΔVfb of 0.02 V can be attributed
to the less oxygen vacancies in the gate dielectrics. As a result,
it can be inferred that S2 with the 20 TMA pulse cycle can delay the
oxygen diffusion and suppress the formation of oxygen vacancies, leading
to the reduced Vfb. The oxide charge densities
(Qox) are calculated to be −3.25
× 1013, −2.39 × 1013, and −3.09
× 1013 for S1, S2, and S3 samples, respectively. All
of the extracted electrical parameters are listed in Table 1. The smallest Qox for S2 implies the least negative oxide charges, which
originates from the least oxygen vacancies in HYO thin films. Based
on Table 1, it can
be noted that compared with S1 and S3, the border trapped oxide charge
density (Nbt) for S2 has a significant
decrease, which is attributed to the suppressed Ga and As diffusion.
Meanwhile, the reduced Nbt also results
in the reduced ΔVfb.

The leakage
current density (J) via applied bias voltage (V) for three samples is plotted in Figure 3b. The observed larger leakage current in
the S1 sample comes from the larger trapped charges and the larger
interface state density. After exposing ALD TMA with 20 pulse cycles
for the S2 sample, the reduction in leakage current was detected,
which can be attributed to the reduced trapped charges and oxide charges
in the interface layer, associated with the reduction of Ga/As oxides
and As elements at/near the HYO/GaAs interface after TMA passivation.
However, for the S3 sample, an apparent increase in the leakage current
was observed, indicating the degraded interface quality. As a result,
it can be noted that ALD TMA with 20 pulse cycles can more effectively
reduce the interface state density and improve the interface quality.
However, to achieve the optimized electrical performance, further
investigation is still needed.

2.3 Interface Optimization of HYO/TMA/GaAs Gate Stacks by Annealing
To investigate the evolution of the interface stability of HYO/TMA/GaAs
gate stacks as a function of postdeposition annealing (PDA) temperature,
XPS measurements were also performed, and more detailed interfacial
information has been obtained. Figure 4 displays the annealing-temperature-dependent As 3d,
Ga 2p, and O 1s XPS spectra for the HYO/TMA/GaAs gate stack. From Figure 4a, the intensities
of the As–As bond and As5+ peaks for the S4 sample
lower than other samples have been observed, indicating that As0 and As5+ have been reduced. With the increase
in annealing temperature, the As oxide content saw an increased tendency,
which will lead to the Fermi-level pinning effect at high annealing
temperatures over 300 °C.40 The same
trend has been detected from the evolution of Ga 2p and O 1s XPS spectra,
shown in Figure 4b,c,
suggesting that annealing at 300 °C suppresses the regrowth of
Ga/As oxides, and the optimized interface chemistry indicates its
potential application in CMOS devices.

and O 1s (c) XPS spectra

2.4 Band Alignment Modulation by Annealing
As a candidate of high-k gate oxides in CMOS devices,
the suitable band offset (BO) between the oxide and the semiconductor
substrate plays an important role. It is critical to obtain MOSFETs
devices with excellent performance by using a high-k gate oxide with BO larger than 1 eV to inhibit the flow of electrons
from the semiconductor to the metal. The monitored offsets in the
valence-band spectra can be used to draw the energy-band alignment
for HYO and the GaAs substrate.

Based on the model proposed
by Kraut,41 the valence-band offset (ΔEv) values of HYO/GaAs gate stacks as a function
of annealing temperature are calculated by using the following equation 6  Ev is the valence-band
edge determined by the linear epitaxial method displayed in Figure 5a. By linear extrapolation,
the Ev of GaAs is calculated to be 0.36
eV. The ΔEv values of S2, S4, S5,
and S6 are 1.65, 1.53, 1.91, and 1.99 eV, respectively. Based on Figure 5a, it can be noted
that increased ΔEv has been observed
with the increase in the annealing temperature, which may originate
from the existing native oxides at the high-k/III–V
interface.32 For S4, the reduction in ΔEv can be attributed to the reduced intrinsic
oxides existing at the HYO/GaAs interface after processing by the
ALD TMA precursor and the optimized annealing temperature.

(a) and band gaps (b) for S2, S4, S5, and S6.

The
conduction band offset (ΔEC) at
the HYO/GaAs interface can be calculated by the following equation 7  Band gaps
(Eg) of all samples deposited on quartz
substrates were determined by a UV–vis spectroscope and are
shown in Figure 5b.
The ΔEC values for all of the samples
are calculated to be 2.10, 2.43, 1.98, and 1.83 eV. Figure 6 shows a schematic diagram
of energy-band alignment for S2, S4, S5, and S6 samples. Apparently,
reduction in ΔEC was observed with
increased annealing temperature, which is due to the increased native
oxides at the HYO/GaAs interface. For the S4 sample, the calculated
ΔEv and ΔEC are larger than 1 eV, suggesting that HYO/TMA/GaAs pretreated
by 20 pulse cycles and 300 °C annealing temperature is suitable
for MOS devices with high performance.

S2, S4, S5, and S6.

2.5 Modulation of Electrical Properties by Rapid Thermal
Annealing
To optimize the electrical properties of the HYO/TMA/GaAs
gate stack with 20 pulsing cycles, PDA was carried out with the annealing
temperature ranging from 300 to 500 °C. Figure 7a shows the annealing-temperature-dependent C–V characteristics of Al/HYO/TMA/GaAs
MOS capacitors measured at 1 MHz. The extracted electrical parameters
are listed in Table 2. Compared with S2, it can be seen that the S4 sample annealed at
300 °C demonstrates optimized C–V behavior with ignorable ΔVfb, including the suitable dielectric constant of 36, a larger
slope in the depletion regime, and the smallest ΔVfb of 0.002, which may be attributed to the optimized
interface chemistry. With the increase in annealing temperature, increased
ΔVfb and reduced accumulation capacitance
have been observed, which may be attributed to the increased density
of the interface state caused by a considerable amount of As–O,
As–As, and Ga–O chemical bonding states at the GaAs/HfYO
interface. As we know, the positive shift in Vfb indicates the existence of negative oxide charges in the
dielectrics. Compared with other samples, a smaller positive Vfb shift has been observed in the S4 sample,
implying the presence of less negative oxide charges and optimized
interface quality.

S6	21.0	506.8	2.17	0.14	–2.15 × 1013	–1.41 × 1012	7.19 × 10–3	
Figure 7b shows the annealing-temperature-dependent leakage
current characteristics. It can be seen that the smallest leakage
current density of 3.55 × 10–6 A cm–2 for the S4 sample has been observed, which mainly can be due to
the reduced border trap charges and interface states. However, on
increasing the annealing temperature from 400 to 500 °C, increased
leakage current has been detected, which may come from the interface
trap-assisted tunneling because of the high interface states existing
at the HYO/GaAs interface. As a result, it can be concluded
that annealing the HYO/TMA/GaAs gate stack with an appropriate temperature
effectively prevents the formation of a low-k interfacial
layer and contributes to the reduced oxygen-vacancy-related interface
states or the increased ΔEC, leading
to the reduced trap-assisted tunneling current.

Figure 8 shows the C–V characteristics of Al/HYO/TMA/GaAs MOS
capacitors with frequencies ranging from 1 to 0.6 MHz. It can be seen
that the frequency dispersion in the accumulation region is more prominent
for S2, S5, and S6, which can result from the higher interface state
density. For the S4 sample, the C–V curve exhibits a smaller frequency dispersion at the accumulation
region, indicating the lower density of interface states after 300
°C heat treatment. Following the percentage frequency dispersion
formula defined as [C0.6M/C1M – 1] × 100%, frequency dispersions are
calculated to be 20.1, 7.5, 17.0, and 40% for S2, S4, S5, and S5,
respectively. Apparently, the evolution of the frequency dispersion
related to the annealing temperature agrees with the XPS results and
electrical measurements. The presence and formation of interfacial
Ga/As oxides for HYO/TMA/GaAs processed with annealing treatment produce
associated high trap density and contribute to the larger frequency
dispersion, leading to the deteriorated electrical performance.

2.6 Current Transport Mechanism
Analysis
To analyze the leakage current conduction behaviors
of the 300 °C-annealed Al/HYO/TMA/GaAs MOS capacitor, the temperature-dependent
gate leakage current has been extensively investigated in the current
work. Figure 9 plots
the J–V characteristics for
the 300 °C-annealed MOS capacitor with the measured temperature
ranging from 77 to 327 K. From Figure 9, it can be seen that under the same absolute voltage,
the leakage current density under gate injection is much larger than
that under substrate injection, which is due to the different energy
bands under different injection modes. The values of leakage current
density for different temperatures (77–327 K) are determined
to be 1.49 × 10–7, 2.96 × 10–7, 6.89 × 10–7, 8.67 × 10–7, 3.17 × 10–5, and 3.4 × 10–4 A cm–2 at a gate voltage of 2 V. The lowest leakage
current density was observed for the 77 K-processed sample. With the
increased processing temperature, the leakage current density demonstrates
an increased trend, which may result from the transformation of the
current conduction mechanism (CCM) with various temperatures. It is
known that the CCM of MOS devices mainly includes Poole–Frenkel
(PF) emission, Fowler–Nordheim (FN) tunneling, and Schottky
emission (SE). In the current work, various types of CCM through gate
oxides will be presented under gate injection and substrate injection
modes.

Figure 9 Low-temperature
leakage
current characteristics of the S4 sample with the temperature ranging
from 77 to 327 K.

Poole–Frenkel (PF) emission involves a mechanism
that is similar to Schottky emission, namely, the thermal excitation
of electrons may emit from traps into the conduction band of the dielectric
layer. Therefore, PF emission is sometimes called the internal Schottky
emission. Considering an electron in a trapping
center, the Coulomb potential energy of the electron can be reduced
by an applied electric field crossing the dielectric film. For PF
emission, the leakage current and electric field (E) should satisfy the following relational expression 8  where
μ is the electronic drift mobility, NC is the density of states in the conduction band, kB is the Boltzmann constant, ϕt is the
trap energy level, and εox is the oxide dielectric
constant. The In(J/E) vs E1/2 are plotted in Figure 10a,b under substrate injection and gate injection
at different temperatures. The εox can be calculated
from the slope of curve 9  The extracted εox values
are in agreement with the previous results obtained from C–V curves and demonstrate a decreased tendency
with the increase of the measured temperature. Therefore, it can be
concluded that the dominant CCM is governed by PF emission for substrate
injection at 277–327 K in the lower electric field (0.36–1.21
MV cm–1) and for gate injection at 177–377
K in the medium electric field (1.66–2.01 MV cm–1). The trap energy-level values (ϕt) can be calculated
by the following formula: . It can be noted that
the ϕt value under substrate injection is smaller
than that under gate injection. Under gate injection, more energy
is needed for the thermally excited electrons crossing the trap level,
indicating that the leakage current under positive voltage is lower
than that under negative voltage.

injection
and (b) gate injection.

The carrier transportation
of Schottky emission results from thermionic emission while the electrons
gain enough energy and cause leakage current. The SE emission mechanism
can be expressed by the following formula 10   11  where A* is the effective Richardson constant, φB is barrier height, εr is the vacuum permittivity
constant, εo is the optical dielectric constant, kB is the Boltzmann constant, m0 is the free electron mass, and mox* is the electron
effective mass. Figure 11 shows the ln(J/T2) versus E1/2 plots measured at 77–277
K at the medium field region (1.69–2.01 MV cm–1) under gate injection. The slopes of the SE plots can be expressed
as 12  where εopt and the refractive index have been determined and are shown
in Figure 11. It is
apparent that the n values measured at 77 and 127 K deviate from the reported
results and agree with the reported results at 177–277 K,42 suggesting that SE emission dominates the CCMs
under gate injection in the medium field region. The intercept of
the linear fitting lines is related to the mox* and φB and can be expressed as intercept = ln 120(mox*/m0) – qφB/kT. Combined with FN-induced CCM, mox* and φB can be determined.

under gate
injection.

FN tunneling follows
the CCM of carriers passing through the insulating layer in a large
electric field, which is a quantum mechanical effect of the electron
wave-function penetrating barrier. Therefore, FN tunneling is independent
of temperature, which can be expressed as the following formula 13  where mT* is the tunneling effective mass in the HYO
film. In the current work, mT* = mo* has been assumed.
If FN tunneling dominates the CCM, ln(J/E2) versus 1/E should be plotted linearly. Figure 12 displays ln(J/E2) versus 1/E under negative bias in a higher electric field (2.94–4.16
MV cm–1) with the temperature changing from 77 to
327 K, implying that the CCM is dominated by FN emission under gate
injection in the medium field region. The slope of the fitted linear
line can be expressed as . Combined with the intercept
of SE emission at 227 K and the slope of the FN tunneling at 77 K,
the relation between mox* and qφB has been determined and is shown in Figure 13. Based on our previous method, the values
of mox* (mT*) and qφB are obtained to be 0.33 m0 and 0.84
eV, respectively. As a result, it can be concluded that PF emission
is dominant at 177–227 K in the lower electric field (substrate
injection) and at 77–277 K in the medium electric field (gate
injection). In addition, SE emission mainly conducts at 77–227
K in the medium electric field. FN tunneling is a significant transportation
mechanism at 77–327 K in the higher electric field, leading
to the increased leakage current density.

3 Conclusions
In the current work, the
effect of the pulse cycles of ALD TMA on the interface chemistry of
GaAs/HYO gate stacks is investigated by means of XPS measurements
and electrical analyses. XPS results have confirmed that the intrinsic
As oxides, As0, and Ga oxides are effectively reduced for
the HYO/GaAs gate stack after ALD TMA treatment with 20 pulse cycles.
Electrical measurements have indicated that 20-cycle-based MOS capacitors
represent the largest dielectric constant, the lowest hysteresis,
and the minimum leakage current density. Based on the optimized pulse
cycles of 20 ALD TMA, postannealing-temperature-dependent interface
chemistry and electrical properties of the HYO/GaAs gate stack have
been investigated. It can be seen that As0, As5+, and Ga–O chemical states from the HYO/GaAs interface are
reduced obviously after 300 °C-annealing treatment. Meanwhile,
the optimized electrical performance, including the greatest dielectric
constant of 38, the minimum leakage current density of 3.28 ×
10–6 A cm–2, and the smallest
hysteresis of 0.01 V, was achieved for the 300 °C-annealed GaAs-based
MOS capacitor. The leakage current mechanism analyses measured at
low temperature have demonstrated that PF emission is dominant at
277–327 K in the lower electric field (substrate injection)
and at 77–377 K in the medium electric field (gate injection);
SE emission mainly conducts from 177 to 227 K in the medium electric
field. In the higher electric field with the temperature ranging from
77 to 327 K, FN tunneling dominates the transportation mechanism.
As a result, it can be concluded that the HYO/GaAs gate stack with
optimized pulse cycles of 20 ALD TMA and modulated annealing temperature
of 300 °C displays potential application as high-k gate dielectrics candidates in future III–V electronics.

4 Experimental Details
4.1 Sample Preparation and Device
Fabrication
In the current work, commercially purchased n-type
GaAs wafers with a resistivity of (1.2–1.6) × 10–3 Ω·cm were chosen as the substrates. First, to remove
some organic compounds on the surface of the wafers, the GaAs wafers
were ultrasonically degreased using acetone, methanol, and isopropanol
for 5 min at room temperature. Then, the GaAs wafers were dipped in
a HBr solution (HBr/H2O = 1:10) for about 5 min for removing
native oxides. After that, the wafers were immersed in an (NH4)2S solution for about 20 min at 50 °C to
passivate the surface of the wafers. Following the above steps, the
wafers were rinsed by deionized water and blown by N2.
After that, these processed wafers were put into an ALD (LabNano 9100,
ENSURENANOTECH) chamber and passivated by the TMA precursor. During
the experiment, different TMA pulse cycles (15, 20, 25) consisting
of TMA (0.02 s)/N2 (8 s) pulses at 200 °C were carried
out (denoted samples S1, S2, and S3). Subsequently, these prepared
GaAs wafers were transferred into a sputtering chamber (JSD 400, JiaShuo
Vacuum Technology Co. Ltd.) immediately. HYO thin films were obtained
by cosputtering 99.9% Y metal target and 99.995% HfO2 ceramic
target. Radio frequency power and direct current power were set at
4 and 70 W, respectively; the specific atomic ratio of Hf/Y in the
HYO films is about 4:1. Moreover, the base pressure and
deposition pressure were maintained at 3.5 × 10–4 and 0.5 Pa, respectively, with the mixture ambient of Ar (30 SCCM)
and O2 (2 SCCM).

4.2 Device Fabrication and Characterization
To obtain the
interface chemistry of HfYO/GaAs gate stacks, about 4 nm-thick HYO
films measured by a spectroscopy ellipsometer (SE, SC630, SANCO Co,
Shanghai) were prepared for X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements
(XPS, ESCALAB 250Xi Thermo Scientific). In the current work, the films
were measured by SE in the range of 300–1100 nm with 65 and
70° angles of incidence. During measurements, the Cauchy–Urbach
model was selected to fit the experimental data. To fabricate MOS
capacitors, 15 nm HYO gate dielectric thin films were deposited on
the GaAs substrate. Al/HYO/TMA/GaAs/Al MOS capacitors were prepared
by fabricating an Al-top electrode with thickness of about 200 nm
and the area of 3.14 × 10–8 m2 through
a shadow mask with 300 μm diameter, and Al was also deposited
as the back electrode to decrease the contact resistance. Besides,
PDA under vacuum ambient was performed at 300, 400, and 500 °C
for 5 min, marked as S4, S5, and S6, respectively. Figure S2 displays the detailed flowchart in the current experiment.
All C–V and J–V characteristics were measured by a semiconductor
analyzer (Agilent B1500A) with Cascade Probe Station. The low-temperature
leakage current characteristic J–V curves were measured by Lake Shore Vacuum Probe Station (TTPX).
All electrical measurements were carried out in a shielding dark box.
