Replacing a single carbon atom in
C24 with a boron atom
allows the functionalization of one additional carbon atom. Such a
process involves little energy cost with regard to the structure of
the fullerene. Two such replacements are required if the fullerenes
are to act as “pearls on a string”. This work shows
trends for increasingly higher levels of carbon replacement with boron
as well as hydrogenation, methylation, and ethylation of a subsequent
carbon atom in such a boron-doped small fullerene. Additionally, dimers
are shown to be stable, and the linking ethyl groups actually stabilize
the overall structure more than when the ethyl groups are on the surface
of the structure and are not serving as linkers. Such stringed fullerenes
would certainly have applications to materials science if polymers
could be made from these stringed pearls and would be suitable for
neutron radiation shielding in spacecraft or spacesuits.

Introduction
The inherent stability of fullerenes makes
them difficult to functionalize.
Although there exists rich fullerene chemistry, most functionalization
of these compounds comes from adding a cyclic group such as diepoxide
or pyrrolidine over a C=C moiety within the structure.1−4 This disrupts the overall π cloud, resulting in a destabilization
of the system. While such functionalization can have varied applications,
even in the creation of veritable molecular submarines for delivering
atomic cargoes for medical applications,5 other means of allowing buckyballs to bond to other species could
have wide-ranging applications, opening up these molecules to more
of their potential uses across the chemical spectrum.

Although
the pure carbon forms of buckyballs are known for their
stability, replacing each C2 group with a B–N has
been proposed and experimentally known almost since the beginning
of fullerene chemistry in the 1980s.6−11 Although such cages have more desirable macroscopic properties such
as melting points or sheer strength than their pure carbon cousins,12−15 the stability of the individual cages at the molecular level, that
is, the average of the bond strengths, is actually weaker in the boron
nitride fullerenes or nanotubes. The dative-type noncovalent interactions
between the separate molecules make for more desirable mechanical
properties, but the individual boron nitride structures are easier
to break.

Recent work has shown that replacing up to half of
the nitrogen
atoms in B12N12 or B16N16 with a methylidyne (CH) actually stabilizes the structure.16−18 Most notably, when every four-membered ring contains a CH in place
of a N and no six-membered rings contain more than one CH in place
of a N, the fullerenes have higher average bond energies. Additionally,
the presence of CH groups allows the direct functionalization of fullerenes
to atoms that are already within the cage structure. Although there
is repulsion and a subsequent energy cost for the inclusion of alkyl
groups onto the carbon formerly of the methylidynes, adding more CH
groups in a typical pattern will continue to stabilize the cage. As
a result, polymers of CH-doped boron nitride fullerenes are possible
with the fullerenes contained within the polymer and not as functional
groups themselves, as has typically been proposed for fullerene-containing
polymers.19

This work extends these
analyses to more pure fullerenes that are
more desirable from synthetic and analytical perspectives. Fullerenes
with a few doped inclusions in the cage structure have been known
for some time,20−22 making them more likely to be analyzed experimentally.23 Buckyballs are known to have magic numbers of
stability, with C24 being one of the smallest of the allotropes.24,25 C24 is isoelectronic with B12N12,26 and it will be used as the prototypical
fullerene for this study. A similar boron (and nitrogen) doping study
on C20 has shown that boron inclusion in the carbon cage
can have a stabilizing effect27 as well
as boron doping on graphene surfaces,28 but subsequent hydrogenation or alkylation has not been robustly
explored in this regard.

Different from the previous work for
B–N inclusion in C24, the doping will instead be
with the isoelectronic B–CH
replacement of a C2 group within the carbon cage. From
another perspective, replacing a carbon atom with a boron atom opens
one of the adjacent carbons to functionalization. Most readily, it
will be a hydrogen atom. Hence, such inclusions will begin with the
various isomers of C22BCH and will build up to higher doping
levels and/or alkyl functionalization instead of mere hydrogenation.
Possible applications of this work include not only the synthesis
of any such polymers but also, most notably, radiation shielding for
spacecraft, components, and even humans above the low Earth orbit.
Hydrogen shields primary neutron and cosmic ray radiation, whereas 10B shields secondary effects. Hence, durable materials that
contain high amounts of boron and hydrogen could aid in both manned
and unmanned space exploration. Polymers containing boron-doped fullerenes
would fit this application nicely. This present study focuses on whether
such structures are stable or not and will leave possible studies
for polymerization and synthesis for future work.

Computational
Details
Geometry optimizations with density-fitted Møller–Plesset
second-order perturbation theory (DF-MP2)29,30 are utilized for this study, combined with the 6-31+G* basis set31 within the PSI4 suite of quantum chemistry programs.32 The performance of DF-MP2 is quite efficient,
opening up larger chemical systems to wave function analysis, making
these computations ab initio unlike many popular flavors of density
functional theory. Additionally, double-zeta MP2 is known to be notably
accurate because of the fortuitous but nonempirical cancellation of
errors.33−36

The average bond, total molecular dissociation, binding, or,
equivalently,
stabilization energy (Es) is defined from
ref (17) as 1  

The Em value corresponds to the MP2/6-31+G*
energy of the total molecule in the singlet ground state, and the
MP2/6-31+G*Ea values are the energies
for each of the atoms or constituent molecular fragments. These include
the lowest energy electronic configurations of B(2P) and
C(3P), C(3P), 2Π CH, 2A′ C–CH3, 2A′ C–CH2CH3, and 3Bu C–CH2CH2–C, similar to that in ref (18). In such a way, the Es are not biased for further bond dissociation
because the only bonds broken are those within the cage molecule.

Results
and Discussion
The DF-MP2/6-31+G-optimized structure of one
isomer of C22BCH is given in Figure 1. This particular structure is the easiest
to conceive because any
carbon atom on the cage is replaced by a boron atom, with the adjacent
carbon atom, a different four-membered ring, having been hydrogenated.
Alternatively, this isomer can be described as a C2 group
lying along an edge of two six-membered rings being replaced because
boron and methylidene are found on separate four-membered rings. To
test if this isomer is of the lowest energy form, the other symmetry-unique
isomers must be computed and their relative energies must be compared.

Figure 1 Optimized
structure of C22BCH in its 1H isomer.

The nomenclature scheme for the replacement follows a fashion
similar
to those of refs (17) and (18). For the
C24 boron replacement and hydrogenation/alkylation, Figure 2 is most readily
used, with the structure of C23B expanded into a Schlegel
diagram. The first boron replacement of a carbon is the reference
point for all further isomerization analyses, and the numbered positions
in Figure 2 showcase
how each carbon atom is affected, either through boron replacement
or functionalization. For the n = 1 level, where n is the number of C2 moieties replaced, only
the hydrogen atoms change their locations. For n >
2, the markers to the left of the dash given in the isomer names,
especially for Table 1, are for the second and higher boron atom replacements and are marked
as “B”. The markers to the right of the dash are for
the hydrogenated carbons (H), methylated carbons (M), and ethylated
carbons (E). Upon dimerization, the E can also indicate where the
ethyl linking group originates, and the two parentheses describe the
replacement positions on each buckyball monomer unit.

Monomers
The n =
2 isomers present
a pattern that is both unsurprising and yet still unexpected. Most
notably, for the former case, the 1H isomer has the lowest total Es, as shown in Table 1. Negative numbers here indicate that the
cage is preferred over the constituent atomic CH, CCH3,
or CCCH3 pieces that make up the cage. However, unlike
the CH replacements of B12N12, the overall Es is actually greater than that of C24. It increases by 0.30 eV, but the total Es for C24 is many orders of magnitude larger at −151.71
eV. Hence, replacement of a C2 with B–CH in the
cage destabilizes the cage only by a small amount. Furthermore, the
most stable way to functionalize a C24 after boron replacement
is to create the structure given in Figure 1. From this geometry, it is clear that some
puckering of the structure takes place because of a lack of p electrons
on that atom. This is consistent with the previous boron nitride fullerene
studies. Here, however, such puckering is destabilizing.

In
any case, methylidene does not have to be created because of hydrogenation
of an adjacent carbon. Hydrogenation at the 7b position is nearly
favored with an Es of 0.39 eV above C24. The 7bH-C22BCH has the hydrogen on the carbon
atom diametrically opposed to the boron atom. The 5H isomer is the
next-lowest, followed by the 3H isomer. Of all n =
1 isomers, the 2H and 8H isomers are the least favored, indicating
that near and far methylidene replacements are favored over an intermediate
distance to the reference boron atom. The reason for this likely results
from the bonding and nonbonding π highest occupied molecular
orbital (HOMO) patterns, shown in Figure 3, of 1H-C22BCH. The stable positions
have the methylidene groups in nonbonding portions of the HOMO while
inclusion of the CH groups in π lobes disrupts the overall MO
structure to a greater degree. In any case, replacement of a carbon
atom with a boron atom and a subsequent hydrogenation of another carbon
atom somewhere on the cage will destabilize the structure by less
than 1.15 eV which is still less than 1.0%. All higher n level monomers analyzed here will assume that the first carbon hydrogenated
will be in the 1 position. Hence, the nomenclature will not expressly
describe the first carbon hydrogenation.

Figure 3 HOMO for 1H-C22BCH.

Moving to the n = 2 level actually brings a surprise.
The most stable isomers actually have the boron atoms substituted
onto the same six-membered ring as the reference boron at the 2, 4,
and 3 positions. Additionally, the 1H position of the methylidene
is also found in this ring. Furthermore, the corresponding second
hydrogenation to create the second methylidenes in the cage also occurs
in this same ring at the 3, 9, and 4 positions, as given in Table 1. As a result, 0.65
eV is the minimum energy increase for double boron replacement/hydrogenation,
which takes place within the same ring. The response may be in such
a way that one ring is already perturbed and that a low energy cost
is involved to boronate the cage, which disturbs the same six-membered
ring as opposed to disrupting one of the other seven. However, the
4B-3H-C20B2(CH)2 isomer at 1.10 eV
has a relative Es nearly double that of
the 3B-4H isomer at 0.65 eV. Although this difference is not significant
in the scheme of the total Es, it showcases
that placement does matter because the second boron and hydrogenated
carbon are within the same four-membered ring. This is disfavored
here because a regular carbon atom separates the two B–CH groups,
causing interference. As a result, the boron atom replacements are
not favored on opposite (para) positions of a six-membered ring but
are more favored at meta positions on the ring.

All of the symmetry-unique
isomers for the replacement of a second
boron atom and an adjacent carbon hydrogenation are tested here. The
range of energies for n = 2 stretches from this 0.65
eV level all the way up to 2.18 eV. As a result, replacing carbon
atoms with the second boron and its corresponding hydrogenation of
another carbon atom raise the energy by roughly one additional electronvolt.
Putting the boron atoms on the opposite side of the cage from one
another is not favored. However, the least favored reactions have
two replacements, either of a boron or a methylidene, on one four-membered
ring. Again, although the total increase in Es is not seemingly prohibitive, some cages are more stable
than the others. As the n level increases, this becomes
more marked.

The most stable n = 3 isomer tested
is the 2,4B-3,9H-C18B3(CH)3 form,
where one of the eight
six-membered rings is fully replaced in an alternating B–CH
pattern around the ring, with a relative Es of 1.94 eV, given in Table 1. This is a notable increase over the lowest n = 3 isomer but less than the highest n = 2 isomer.
Although modeling all of the n = 3 isomers is intractable,
trends begin to emerge. The next-lowest n = 3 isomer
tested has nearly the same Es at 1.97
eV, but the boron atoms are as far away from one another as possible.
The newly hydrogenated carbon atoms are still adjacent to their corresponding
boron atoms. However, they continue to be in different four-membered
rings. Replacement of more than two atoms, either B or CH, in a single
four-membered ring destabilizes the structure to a greater extent.

On the whole, inclusion of a third boron atom and a hydrogenated
carbon atom raise Es by roughly another
whole electronvolt. For two n = 4 isomers, Es continues to rise but can vary depending upon
the location of the boron atoms and hydrogenated carbons. This trend
endures for n = 5, as shown at the bottom of Table 1. The chosen token n = 6 isomer, 1b,4b,7,8b,13B-2,5,9,110b,11,14H, has one
B–CH in every four-membered ring, which is why its Es value (3.62 eV) is less than that of the token n = 5 isomer (4.07 eV). Regardless, full replacement at
the n = 12 level results in an 11.44 eV Es relative to C24. As such, the n ≥ 7 levels will grow Es at a
faster rate because more than two atoms will have to be replaced in
each four-membered ring. Hence, functionalization of C24 through B–CH doping is likely best done with as few replacements
as possible.

To see how functionalization can take place, methylation,
as opposed
to hydrogenation, of the carbon atoms to create :Ċ–CH3 groups will now be present within the cage. These so-called
M groups here showcase how further interference with the cage takes
place with bulkier groups. The bottom of Table 1 shows their Es values. Putting an M group at the 1 position for the 1M isomer only
has a cost of 0.77 eV. Although this is double that of hydrogenation,
it is still less than that of the more costly n =
1 CH-containing isomers. Moving up to n = 2 for the
M isomers increases Es by roughly 1.0
eV once more. Having the second B atom and M group at the most favorable
positions from the hydrogenations to produce the 4B-9M-C20B2CHCCH3 isomer is much more favored at a relative Es of 1.69 eV than by putting the additional
boron and M group on the diametric opposite side of the cage with
an energy increase of 2.11 eV. Further functionalization with more
boron atoms and carbon methylation will certainly destabilize the
cage further, as was shown for the higher n levels
for the hydrogenation.

Moving from the M to the E groups, where
the latter is precisely
a :Ċ–CH2CH3 group within the cage,
shows that there is little difference between M and E. For instance,
a single B replacement and carbon atom ethylation at the n = 1 level produce nearly the same Es as a methylation. The 1E Es relative
to C24 is 0.79 eV, merely 0.02 eV more than the 1M three
rows above in Table 1. The terminal hydrogens in the alkyl ethyl group interact with the
π electrons on the surface of the cage, stabilizing the functional
group nearly as much as the hydrogen atoms on the first carbon atom
in the ethyl group repel one another. This stabilization of the ethyl
group is further evidenced in the n = 2 E level because
the 8bB-7E isomer is actually 0.22 eV lower than the 8bB-7M isomer.
Hence, adding methyl or ethyl groups to the outside of the cage will
destabilize the structure a little, but ethyl group additions will
not cause large disturbances in the cage structure, allowing for linkage
between monomers.

Ethyl-Linked Dimers
To analyze the
possible polymerization
of these boron-doped fullerenes, dimers are constructed here and tested
to see how well the monomers may attach to one another. To analyze
how C23B cages can alkylate, the lowest energy isomers
of the hydrogenated monomers are constructed in joint pairs with their Es values now relative to 2·C24 monomers. As a first case, the (7bE)(5E) dimer isomer
(also shown visually in Figure 4) has an increase of Es of only
1.02 eV upon boron replacement and ethylation. Looking at combinations
from the other lowest monohydrogenated isomers of the 1 and 3 positions,
in addition to the 3 and 7 positions, produces Es values only slightly above this value, ranging up to 1.31
eV for the studied isomers. This is less than 0.5% destabilization
of the total fullerene cage.

Figure 4 Optimized structure of (7bE)(5E)-2C23BE.

The trend is quite clear from
the present structures that alkylation
and dimerization may even be less costly per monomer in a polymer
than for the monomer alone as the Es values
in Table 2 highlight.
For instance, ethylation on the monomer has an Es of 0.79 eV at the 1 position. The (1E)(3E) dimer isomer has
an Es of 1.15 eV. Half of that is 0.58
eV, which is less than 0.79 eV. Hence, alkylation of the boron-doped
cages is promising.

However, at least double substitutions
for the n = 2 level per cage have to be stable because
any polymer would require
alkylation to at least two sites on each cage to continue the polymer.
Ethylation to link the monomers followed by hydrogenation to showcase
that such double replacements per cage are possible for the dimer
is also given in Table 2. In these cases, the first boron atom position is not named because
it is the reference point. Again, putting boron atoms and corresponding
hydrogenated carbons on opposite sides of the fullerene cage is not
the most favored interaction. Instead, this falls to meta-type structures where the opposing functionalized carbon atoms are
roughly 2/3 of the way around the cage from one another. Although
these are stable, questions with regard to possible synthesis arise
because of the steric hindrances present if the positions are too
close together. Although this must be considered, on the whole, the
cost of a subsequent second boron replacement and hydrogenation raises
the Es slightly notably, by more than
a factor of 2 relative to monoreplaced dimers. This cost is now more
than 1% of the total Es but is still relatively
small.

Methylating the two lowest energy n =
2 dimer
hydrogenated isomers also adds roughly another electronvolt of cage
destabilization. However, this is essential if these “pearls”
can be strung together. The relative energy cost is about 1.5%, but
such small destabilizations are likely readily absorbed by the cages.
Ethylation instead of methylation as well as having the additional
fullerenes to interact with the hydrogen atoms in the alkyl linkers
will likely reduce this energy cost, as has been shown for the monomers
and the n = 1 dimers. Hence, the destabilization
per cage will likely average down to 1.0%, an almost certainly acceptable
value.

Higher levels of boron replacement and corresponding
alkylation
will increase the energy cost. As such, the n = 2
replacement level is almost certainly the highest desired value. This
is enough to provide the fullerenes with the capability to form chains
and rings similar to the allotropes of sulfur. Such structures could
have applications across materials science for flexible electronics,
strong materials, and radiation shielding.

Conclusions
If
two boron atoms can be introduced into C24 cages,
then two carbon atoms can be functionalized. After functionalization,
these cages can be linked together potentially to form polymers. Although
such processes do introduce an energy cost, the trends shown here
infer that this cost will be less than 1% of the total Es. This energy cost is low enough that the cages should
be able to absorb this slight destabilization, with little effect
on the structures. Such single- or double-boron doping should be experimentally
practical and is more promising than methylidene replacement in boron
nitride fullerenes.

Specifically, for this study, replacing
a carbon atom with a boron
atom and hydrogenating or otherwise alkylating a second carbon atom
in a C24 fullerene destabilize the cage but by less than
1%. The replacing boron atoms and their alkylated carbon atom counterparts
are most stable and adjacent to one another but in different four-membered
rings. However, the second and higher boron atoms prefer to be either
in the same six-membered ring or in a position close to but not quite
opposite from one another. Although the former case is the more stable,
the latter case is close to Es and will
likely be necessary for any polymerization.
