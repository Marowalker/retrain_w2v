Ionic polymer–metal composite
(IPMC) actuators are one of
the most prominent electroactive polymers with expected widespread
use in the future. The IPMC bends in response to a small applied electric
field as a result of the mobility of cations in the polymer network.
This paper proposes a Levenberg–Marquardt algorithm backpropagation
neural network (LMA–BPNN) prediction model applicable for Cu/Nafion-based
ionic polymer–metal composites to predict the actuation property.
The proposed approach takes the dimension ratio (DR) and stimulation
voltage as the input layer, displacement and blocking force as the
output layer, and trains the LMA–BPNN with the experimental
data so as to obtain a mapping relationship between the input and
the output and obtain the predicted values of displacement and blocking
force. An IPMC actuating system is set up to generate a collection
of the IPMC actuating data. Based on the input/output training data,
the most suitable structure was found out for the BPNN model to represent
the IPMC actuation behavior. After training and verification, a 2-9-3-1
BPNN structure for displacement and a 2-9-4-1 BPNN structure for blocking
force indicate that the structure can provide a good reference value
for the IPMC. The results showed that the BPNN model based on the
LMA could predict the displacement and blocking force of the IPMC.
Therefore, this model can become an effective solution for IPMC control
applications.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Ionic polymer–metal
composites (IPMCs) are an important
class of electroactive polymers consisting of a thin layer of ionic
polymer film and two layers of metal electrodes.1−3 As shown in Figure 1, the membrane contains
anions (SO3–) connected to the backbone,
cations that can freely travel within the membrane, and water molecules.4,5 At applied voltage, the transportation of hydrated cations and water
molecules to the cathode leads to the expansion of the membrane on
one side of the cathode, which leads to the bending motion of the
IPMC sample6 (Figure 1). Because of the low driven voltage, flexibility,
biocompatibility, and large deformation, IPMCs have been widely used
in different fields such as biomechanical and biomedical applications,
robotics, flexible sensing, as well as the aerospace and vehicle industry.7−9

principle of an IPMC actuator. Before applying electrical
stimulation (top) and after applying electrical stimulation (bottom).

The types of ions in polymer membranes, the type
and thickness
of metal electrodes, the size and hysteresis of polymer membranes,
and environmental factors can influence the behavior of IPMCs.10−12 These factors may lead to oscillations and instabilities in IPMC
performance, and the combination of these factors makes it difficult
to accurately model the behavior of IPMC actuators. Therefore, it
is important to establish a precise IPMC model to study its bending
characteristics and apply it to the system control of the executive
mechanism. Punninget13 found that resistances
of both electrode surfaces of the IPMC sheet changed during the bending
operation. Vahabi14 proposed a parametric
identification method for IPMC actuators as the combination of nonlinear
and linear least-squares methods. Caponetto15 developed an improved electromechanical gray box model with experimental
features. On the other hand, forward methods,16 auto-regressive moving average exogenous methods,17 the NARX structure fuzzy model and particle swarm optimization
methods,18 and the adaptive neuro-fuzzy
inference system model19 have been proposed
to identify the IPMC actuation behavior. However, none of the models
mentioned is sufficient to accurately describe the nonlinear behavior
of the IPMC, or the large bending behavior of the IPMC actuator is
not taken into account in the identification of their nonlinear behavior.
Moreover, the fits of models were not ideal, which limits the applicability
of the proposed models.

Backpropagation neural networks (BPNNs)
have good abilities of
nonlinear mapping, generalization, and fault tolerance and are suitable
for dealing with complex systems difficult to describe with accurate
mathematical models. To meet the current demands for IPMC modeling
methods and to refine the research on the characteristics of IPMCs,
we present a BPNN model for nonlinear identification of IPMC actuators
in large deformations. Our goal is to develop an accurate and transparent
identification method for IPMCs with large displacements using BPNNs.
Moreover, the displacement and blocking force model of IPMCs is established
by BP neural networks. The displacement and blocking force of IPMCs
is predicted, which indicates that the established BPNN model has
high precision for the prediction of IPMCs. It is of great significance
to better determine the input (stimulation voltage) and size (dimension
ratio) parameters of IPMCs.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Characterization of IPMCs
Figure 2 exhibits the scanning
electron microscopy (SEM) images and energy-dispersive spectroscopy
(EDS) of the electrode layer of IPMCs. As shown in Figure 2, the IPMC surface was fully
covered by copper, and it also shows that copper distribution is uniform
and compact with smaller copper particles, and the presence of Cu
on the surface of the IPMCs was confirmed by EDS measurements. Moreover,
the Cu content is 85.47% from EDS data, and it further reveals that
Cu particles have been deposited well on the surface of membranes,
which is beneficial to the actuation performance of IPMCs. Meanwhile,
we also found that the oxygen content is 10.14% from the EDS data,
which is mainly due to the oxidization of some of the Cu on the surface.
The presence of Ag is due to the fact that Ag+ is not completely replaced
during the electroless plating process and a portion remains on the
surface.9

Figure 2 SEM image and EDS of the electrode layer.

2.2 Actuation property of IPMCs
The relationship
between maximum displacement and voltage under different L/W ratios is displayed in Figure 3. The results showed that the displacement
first increased and then decreased as the voltage increased. The four
samples continuously increased to maximum displacements at 9 V, and
it is 30 mm for the L/W = 4 sample.
At the same time, we find that the size effect has a great influence
on the displacement of IPMCs. The larger the size ratio is, the greater
the output displacement is and the higher the performance of IPMCs
is. The high performance of IPMCs is related to the interface of dispersed
Cu particles near the ionic membrane surface, leading to high transport
and adsorption at the electrodes.20 when
the voltage is greater than 9 V, the displacement decreases gradually,
mainly because the water molecules contained in the IPMCs are decomposed,
resulting in the lack of hydrated cations in the membrane that can
move. Figure 4 shows
the maximum blocking forces of the IPMCs with various sizes under
different voltages. In general, the force of all samples peaked and
then fastly decreased. The L/W =
1 and L/W = 4 samples continuously
increased to the maximum blocking forces of 15 and 8.8 mN at 8 V,
respectively. Moreover, the L/W =
2 and L/W = 3 samples had maximum
blocking forces of 14.6 and 13 mN at 9 V, respectively. The suitable
stimulation voltage for the maximum blocking force output is 8–9
V, and it was observed that the larger the L/W ratio, the smaller the blocking force output at the same
voltage; on the contrary, the smaller the L/W ratio, the larger the blocking force. This is similar
to previous studies of platinum IPMCs.

2.3 Nonlinear
Model for the IPMC Actuators Based
on BPNNs
The BPNN is a multilayer feedforward network trained
according to the error backpropagation algorithm. It is one of several
prediction methods, which determines the mapping relationship between
network input factors and outputs by historical sample data for learning
and training.21,22 The learning rule is to use the
steepest descent method to minimize the error sum of squares by adjusting
the network weights and threshold in backpropagation.23,24 The BPNN consists of forward propagation of the input signal and
backpropagation of the error signal.25,26

The
input signal is propagated from the input layer, going through some
hidden layers and propagating to the output layer. During the propagation,
weights and thresholds of the network are maintained unchanged, and
the status of each node affects the next layer. In the forward propagation,
error exists between the real output value of the output layer and
the excepted value, so the backpropagation of the error signal is
needed. The error signal is noted as the difference between the real
output of the output layer and the excepted output signal. The error
signal is propagated from the output layer, going through hidden layers
and to the input layer. During this propagation, the weights of the
neural network are regulated. With the continuous regulation of weights
and thresholds, the error signal can be kept small enough to make
the output signal closer to the excepted output signal.

In this
paper, a network prediction model is designed for Cu-IPMC
materials to predict the displacements or blocking forces. It is necessary
to launch some prediction work on displacements or blocking forces
as evidence to improve the actuation performance of IPMCs. The dimension
ratio (L/W ratio, where L is the length of IPMCs and W is the width)
and stimulation voltage can be used as input variables, and the output
is displacement or force. Figure 5 shows the structure of a BPNN.

Figure 5 Structure of a BPNN system.

The BPNN operating process includes the following
steps:(1) Initialization,
each connection weight
({wij} and {vjt}) and threshold ({θj} and {γt}) of
the model are assigned a random value within the interval [−1,
1].

(2) The number of network
input layer
nodes k, the number of hidden layer nodes p, the number of output layer nodes q,
the neuron excitation function of the hidden layer ϕ, the neuron
excitation function of the output layer ψ, the input sample xi, the target output yt, the target precision ε,
and the learning rate are determined.

(3) Hidden layer input and output calculation.
The hidden layer input S and output B are calculated from the input vectors x, w, and ϕ. f is the Sigmoid function. 1   2  

(4) Output layer input and output calculation.

that controls the speed of the modification.

(8) If the error E <
ε, the training is completed, otherwise go to step (2) until
the accuracy requirement is met.



2.4 BPNN Model Training and Verification
Prior to training,
the data is normalized by the mapminmax function. 10  where x is
the original vector
value, xmin and xmax are the minimum and maximum values of x, respectively, and X is the vector value normalized by the x vector.

In this paper, the transfer function of
the hidden layer of the BP neural network selects the tansig function,
the transfer function of the output layer adopts the purelin function,
and the training target is set for 0.0001. The trainlm function is
used as the training function based on the Levenberg–Marquardt
algorithm (LMA). The LMA is interpolated between the Gauss–Newton
algorithm (GNA) and the method of gradient descent. The LMA is more
robust than the GNA, that is, in many cases, even if it starts far
from the final minimum, it can find a solution. Letting the Jacobian
of target function be denoted J, then the Levenberg–Marquardt
method searches in the direction given by the solution to the equations.
Note that the Jacobian matrix J of connection weight (w) is defined as follows in the algorithm 11  The standard statistical parameters were used
to calculate the determination coefficient (R or
DC) and the root-mean-square error (RMSE) according to eqs 12 and 13 12   13  where T and n are the target (training or experimental)
data vector and the total
number of training data, T̅ and Ŷ are the average of the training values and model output (predicted)
values, respectively.

In the BP neural network, the number of
nodes in the hidden layer
greatly influences the performance of the neural network. Too few
nodes will result in a small amount of information obtained by the
network, which is not sufficient to refine rules contained in samples.
Too many nodes will lead to the extension of the training time, weakening
of the generalization ability, and even lead to the phenomenon of
“overfitting”. Therefore, it is very important to set
a reasonable number of nodes in the hidden layer.27 The calculation equation of the number of neurons in the
hidden layer is as follows28 14  The
number of neurons in the hidden layer
is examined in the range from 3 to 9, based on the model calculations
and the requirement of model accuracy. Next, the BPNN is trained with
different hidden layers using the LMA mechanism. In the process of
training, the data is automatically divided into a training set, a
validation set, and a test set. A data set that is chosen in random
sets are used for training and the rest of them (validation set and
test set) are then employed for blind testing of the BPNN. Moreover,
the error between three data sets and the target will change constantly.
When all three of them tend to be consistent, a better prediction
result can be obtained. It is found from repeated training that nine
neurons in the hidden layer could estimate IPMC displacement and blocking
force with the highest accuracy. The detailed data are shown in Table 1 and Figure 6. It can be seen that the prediction
results are highly correlated in general. The RMSE values of displacement
and blocking force are 1.53160 and 3.21854, and DC values are 0.88725
and 0.93251, respectively. This indicates that the BPNN has a strong
ability to characterize the bending behavior of IPMCs.

and predicted IPMC displacement
(a) and blocking force (b). R, T, and Y are the determination coefficient, target
(experimental) data vector, and model output (predicted) values, respectively.
The ordinate is the corresponding function of prediction fitting.

blocking force	2-9-1	0.93251	3.21854	8	2.58 × 10–5	
However, we
also found from Figure 6 that there is a small amount of data that deviates
from the target to a certain extent. To further improve the accuracy
of the prediction, the optimization of the training structure for
the hidden layer is shown in Figure 7. A hidden layer is added to the double hidden layer
to train repeatedly as mentioned in the above process. The IPMC modeling
results using the optimized NBBM are displayed in Table 2 and Figure 8. As for the displacement, the comparison
between before and after optimization showed that the accuracy increased
from 2.25 × 10–5 to 4.14 × 10–7, R2 from 0.88725 to 0.95155, and RMSE
from 1.53160 to 1.027114. Similarly, for blocking forces, the accuracy
and R2 improved one magnitude and 5.82%,
respectively, while RMSE decreased about 56.93%. Therefore, the neural
network structures of the layers (2-9-3-1 and 2-9-4-1) are selected,
which have high precision and are suitable for IPMCs. After 9 and
13 iterations, the systems quickly converge and the system’s
error reaches the training target.

Meanwhile,
the modeling diagram for using the optimized BPNN model
is then displayed in Figure 9. The actual actuator response is compared with the estimated
response by the optimized BPNN model. From this figure, the predicted
values of each point are basically consistent with the experimental
values. It is clear that the optimized NBBM model can accurately estimate
the displacement and blocking force of IPMCs. The comparison results
demonstrated convincingly that the optimized BPNN always provides
the best results in predicting behavior. The BPNN model provides a
theoretical basis for the selection of the stimulating voltage and
the design of the dimension ratio.

IPMC displacement for the
2-9-3-1 structure (a) and blocking force for the 2-9-4-1 structure

The BPNN with the mentioned optimum
designation is successfully
incorporated to numerically model the actuation characteristics of
the investigated Cu-IPMC. Moreover, as indicated in the results, the
well-trained ANN has better prediction capability over the displacement
and blocking force model considering stimulating voltage and dimension
ratio. This examination confirms the outstanding function estimation
potential of the multilayer BPNN to simulate the actuation property
of this Cu-IPMC.

3 Conclusions
Predicting
the actuation property of Cu-IPMCs accurately is quite
important and indispensable for improving the reliability of IPMC
applications. We propose the LMA–BPNN model to predict the
actuation property of the Cu-IPMCs. The model is based on the recurrent
multilayer perceptron neural networks and optimized the weight and
threshold of the randomly initialized BPNN by the Levenberg–Marquardt
algorithm (LMA). Based on the input/output training data, the most
suitable BPNN model structure was found out to represent the IPMC
actuation behavior. The optimized BPNN model has been investigated
to evaluate the modeling accuracy. After calculation, an RMSE of 1.03
and a DC of 0.95 for displacement and an RMSE of 1.26 and a DC of
0.99 for blocking force were obtained, which manifest that the model
can provide a lgood reference value for IPMCs. The optimized BPNN
can better describe the bending of the IPMC actuator and accurately
predict the displacement and blocking force of the IPMC.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials
Nafion
117 membranes (A
sulfonated tetrafluoroethylene-based fluoropolymer–copolymer)
with a thickness of 0.183 mm were used as the substrate membranes.
Platinum is usually used as the electrode material, and we deliberately
choose copper-substituted platinum. The unstable corrosive copper
is beneficial for the improvement of IPMC performance.

4.2 Preparation of Cu-IPMCs
As shown
in previous studies,29,30 to increase the interfacial area
and enhance adhesion, the surface of Nafion was roughened using sandpaper
and ultrasonically cleaned in deionized water. The membranes were
soaked in 3 g/L silver nitrate for 12 h and then immersed in the plating
solution for electroless copper plating. Finally, they were immersed
in a lithium chloride solution to let the H+ ions of Nafion
get replaced with small Li+ions. After the preparation
steps were complete, the IPMC was cut into different sizes (40 ×
10, 30 × 10, 20 × 10, 10 × 10 mm2; free-moving
end).

4.3 Performance Test
The microstructures
and morphologies of the IPMCs were characterized using scanning electron
microscopy (SEM, JEM 2010). The displacement and blocking force of
the Cu-IPMCs were measured by a digital camera (a frame grabber) and
a load cell (FA2004, 0.0001 g) in the test setup composed of a signal
generator, a power amplifier, a DC power supply, and a DAQ. The experiments
were carried out at room temperature, and the average value over three
measurements was adopted.
