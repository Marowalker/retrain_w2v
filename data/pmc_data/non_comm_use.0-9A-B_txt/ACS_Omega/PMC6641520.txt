Conjugated polymer
extraction (CPE) is a low-cost, scalable process
that can enrich single-walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) materials in
organic media. For other separation methods in aqueous phases, redox
chemistry and/or pH control dramatically affect the sorting process
of the SWCNTs. We have previously determined that the CPE process
can be fine-tuned by adjusting the pH on the tube surface. Here, we
systematically studied the effect of redox chemistry on the CPE process
by adding organic p-/n-dopants. At a very strong p-/n-doping level,
static repulsions dominated the interactions between the tubes and
the CPE lost selectivity. When the doping level changed from a medium
p-doping to a neutral state, the yield of CPE increased and the selectivity
was compromised. We also observed chiral selectivity when a weak p-dopant
was used. A photoluminescence excitation mapping under different titration
conditions provided more insight into the doping level of the tubes
relative to their diameters, chiralities, and redox potentials. We
proposed a mechanism for the CPE process. The semiconducting and metallic
tubes are separated because of their different solubilities, which
are determined by the bundling energy between the tubes and are related
to their doping level in polymer solutions.

1 Introduction
Recently, conjugated polymer
extraction (CPE) has been extensively
studied for the enrichment of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs).1−4 Compared with other sorting methods, such as density gradient ultracentrifugation,
gel chromatography, and the recently developed two-phase extraction,
the CPE process has several obvious advantages.1−6 First, its cost is very low. Only a regular bath or tip sonication
and a low-speed centrifuge are required for instrumentation. The cost
of the polymer can also be reduced if polymers with simple structures,
such as polythiophene or polyfluorene, are used. Moreover, this cost
can be further dramatically reduced if recyclable polymers are used.7 Second, this process is scalable, and it is only
restricted by the capacities of the sonicator and the centrifuge,
which can be improved with a continuous flow-through apparatus. Third,
the obtained products have a high concentration and tube content due
to the strong interaction of the polymers with the tubes and the high
affinity of the organic solvents for the tubes. In practice, in a
stable tube/polymer dispersion, the tube/polymer weight ratio can
reach 1/1 and the tube concentration can be more than 0.5 g/L. Both
values are much higher than those obtained via an aqueous process.
Fourth, the semiconducting (sc) purity of the CPE product can be greater
than 99.9%, which is sufficient for some low-end applications.8 In addition, the nature of the organic phase
can add other benefits to the application of these materials. For
example, we found that these organic phase dispersions can be easily
deposited on substrates to form high-density networks and high-performance
thin film transistors can be easily fabricated.9

Until now, most of the work in this field has focused
on investigating
different polymer structures.1−6,10,11 Although some of these experiments are quite successful, the control
of the yield and the selectivity are still challenging, and the selection
mechanism is not well understood. Recently, Cuniberti et al. proposed
that the diameter selectivity mechanism is a competition between tube
bundling and polymer adsorption.12 Their
simulation agrees well with other experimental findings regarding
the diameter selectivity, but this mechanism failed to explain the
more important electric-type selectivity of the sorting process and
the nature of the bundling between the different types of tubes.

The redox chemistry and pH affect the sorting of SWCNTs in aqueous
systems.13−16 Zheng et al. found that redox molecules trigger the reorganization
of the surfactant coating layer on SWCNTs in aqueous two-phase systems.17 In addition, they noted that the solubility
of polymer-wrapped SWCNTs in organic solvents strongly depends on
the redox status. Recently, our group reported that adjusting the
surface acidity of SWCNTs via the addition of sodium hydroxide dramatically
influences the CPE process.18 The selective
mechanism for the dispersion of semiconducting versus metallic (m)
carbon nanotube (CNT) was attributed to oxygen doping under ambient
conditions, which will preferentially cause the bundling of highly
polarizable metallic (m) tubes.

In this article, we further
expanded the range of the redox doping
level using organic dopants in addition to oxygen/water redox couples
to investigate their effect on the CPE of SWCNTs. We found that both
the yield and purity of the SWCNTs from the CPE of raw tube materials
can be modulated by the dopants. We also observed chirality selectivity
under certain doping conditions, which was related to the energy level
and/or diameter of the tubes. The photoluminescence excitation (PLE)
mapping titration study of the tube solutions under different doping
levels further revealed the mechanism of this diameter selectivity.
This new insight provides guiding principles in sc-SWCNT enrichment,
allowing further control on both the chirality and semiconducting
purity of a key enabling material in high-end and printed electronics.19

2 Results and Discussion
The structures of the four dopants are shown in Scheme 1.20 They all contain benzene rings in their structures, which can improve
both their solubility in toluene and affinity for SWCNTs.21−24 SWCNTs can be amphoterically doped via encapsulation of organic
molecules within the SWCNTs, and the charge transfer is controlled
via the ionization potential or electron affinity of the guest molecules.25,26 For plasma torch-synthesized, raw SWCNTs with an average diameter
of 1.3 nm, phenyl hydrazine (PHz) and benzyl viologen (BV) donate
electrons (n-doping) to and benzoyl peroxide (BPO) and 2,3-dichloro-5,6-dicyano-p-benzoquinone (DDQ) withdraw electrons (p-doping) from
the tubes depending on the redox potential of the dopants.27 We added a certain amount of the dopants into
a poly(9,9-di-n-docecylfluorene) (PFDD) solution,
and CPEs were performed under the same conditions.28 The detailed experimental procedure and spectra can be
found in the Supporting Information (SI)
(Figures S1–S5).

Scheme 1 Structures of the
Dopants Used in This Study
In summary, the UV absorption spectra, yield, and ϕ
value
from the supernatant of the second extraction are shown in Figure 1.28 We chose the second extraction as typical data because
we found that the first extraction heavily depends on source materials
and their pretreatment, which determines the initial doping state
of the materials and will affect the CPE process as will be demonstrated
in this work. Here, ϕ is the ratio of the integrated areas of
only the S22 band to that of the S22 band plus
its background, which can be closely related to the purity level and
ranges from 0.07 to 0.42 corresponding from raw materials to high-sc-purity
samples.4 The y axis (UV
absorption) was not normalized, and the peak intensity can be directly
related to the tube concentration and yield. Clearly, the addition
of PHz or BV dramatically improves the yield of the CPE process. In
a regular control experiment, the yield for the first extraction is
usually less than 0.3% and the total yield for the first four extractions
is 3.39%. A higher yield of 2.82% appears in the fifth extraction.
However, when a very small amount of PHz or BV (0.64 mM or 2.1% relative
to the carbon in the raw material) is added, the yields of the first
and second extractions are over 1 and 4%, respectively, and the yield
of the first four extractions improves to over 10%. The sc-purity
only slightly decreases to a ϕ value of ∼0.33, corresponding
to 99% pure sc-SWCNTs.8 The addition of
a higher concentration of n-dopants further slightly increases the
yield, but the purity is compromised. The yield and purity of the
CPE can also be adjusted by changing the polymer/tube ratio or solution
concentration, but these methods are less effective.28

Figure 1 Representative absorption spectra of the supernatants from the
second PFDD extraction of the SWCNT samples with the addition of (a)
n-type and (b) p-type dopants. The inset shows the yield (η%)
and ϕ value.

Interestingly, the addition
of 0.64 mM p-dopant (DDQ or BPO) leads
to a very low yield (∼0.1%). A further addition of BPO (3.2
mM) improves the yield to 0.38% but at the cost of the selectivity.
The quenching of the bands at S11 (1200–1900 nm)
is due to the increased p-doping level, whereas the bands at S22 (700–1100) are not severely affected by the addition
of these dopants (Figure S6).20,29 Two small peaks at 1275 and 1335 nm emerge in the spectrum of the
second extraction when 0.64 mM DDQ is added. We performed additional
CPE on this precipitate, and the normalized spectra are shown in Figure 2. Clearly, this CPE
shows chirality selectivity, and the small-diameter tubes ((14, 0)
or (9, 7)) are extracted first, followed by the middle-diameter tubes
((10, 8) and (11, 7)) and the large-diameter tubes ((10, 9), (12,
8), and (11, 10)). In the Raman spectra of the filtered solid sample
from these fractions (Figure S7 in SI),
the radial breathing mode (RBM) bands clearly confirm that the smaller-diameter
tubes are extracted out first because the RBM frequency of the Raman
shift is the reciprocal of the diameter of the tubes.30 Zheng et al. also observed similar chirality selectivity
in their redox sorting of SWCNTs in an aqueous phase.17

Figure 2 Absorption spectra of the supernatants from the PFDD extractions
of SWCNTs in the presence of 0.64 mM DDQ. Only spectra from 2nd, 5th,
and 10th extractions are shown, and the spectra are normalized and
stacked. Control spectrum is from second extraction without addition
of any dopants.

To further explore the
effects of the dopants on the CPE of SWCNTs,
PLE maps were tracked in a series of titration experiments in a high-purity
sc-SWCNT/PFDD solution, and the spectra are shown in Figures S8 and S9 of the SI.31 We
monitored the fluorescence intensity of six (n, m) species (labeled on Figure S8A and listed in Table S1), and the relationship
of the relative intensity and the dopant concentration is drawn in Figure 3.32,33 Under ambient conditions, SWCNTs are slightly p-doped because of
the H2O/O2 redox couple.34−38 Therefore, the addition of the n-dopant BV first
neutralizes this p-doping effect, resulting in a corresponding increase
in the fluorescence intensity.20,39 This effect reaches
a plateau when the concentration of BV is approximately 1.75 ×
10–4 mol/L and the ratio of the BV/C atoms in the
tubes is 1/3.8. Then, the sc-tubes reach an electrically neutral state,
and the valence band is fully filled, whereas the conduction band
is still empty. Further addition of BV leads to a rapid decrease in
the fluorescence intensity because of n-doping, and the conduction
band is partially filled by electrons. The addition of the p-dopant
DDQ to the control sample reduces the fluorescence intensity of the
tubes because of the enhanced p-doping level.20 More importantly, the decrease in the fluorescence intensity of
the larger-diameter tubes is faster than that of the small-diameter
tubes at the same dopant concentration, and this difference was further
demonstrated by their energy levels, which we will discuss in the
following section. Doorn et al. also reported a similar chiral-selective
bleaching of SWCNTs in an aqueous phase with organic acceptor molecules.40

Figure 3 Relative fluorescence intensity of six sc-SWCNT (CCNT = 8.0 mg/L) species in a PFDD (CPFDD = 34.7 mg/L) toluene solution with the addition of
the
p-dopant DDQ (left) or n-dopant BV (right).

Next, the CPE mechanism for SWCNTs with different redox states
was considered.17 The redox potentials
of six representative sc-tubes and dopants are plotted in Figure 4.23,41,42 Under very high p-/n-doped conditions, all
of the m/sc-tubes are highly positively or negatively charged and
the electrostatic repulsion between the tubes dominates their interaction.
Because of this, selective bundling of the tubes does not occur and
the CPE loses its selectivity. The reported spontaneous dissolution
of reduced nanotubes by metal anions in polar aprotic solvents can
be ascribed to the high n-doping.43−45 Smalley et al. also
reported the high solubility of SWCNTs in superacids via direct protonation,
which is in the highly p-doped region.46

Figure 4 Reduction
and oxidation potentials of the (n, m) SWCNTs as a function of the nanotube diameter.41 The energy levels of the four dopants used in
this study are also shown. The right side scheme shows the relationship
between the selectivity and yield of the CPE process with the SWCNT
samples and the Fermi level of the system.

Under ambient conditions, the tubes are slightly p-doped
because
of the H2O/O2 redox couple, and their doping
level can be easily adjusted with the addition of p-/n-dopants.20,35−37 Upon addition of n-dopants (BV or PHz), the yield
improves at the cost of the selectivity, corresponding to the gradual
removal of the slightly p-doped state. This trend continues until
the tubes reach a neutral state, and then, the CPE completely loses
selectivity.35 The effect of PHz is more
obvious because it is an n-dopant and an efficient oxygen scavenger.42 In contrast, after the addition of p-dopants,
the CPE has a poor yield but chiral selectivity can be obtained under
certain conditions. The oxidation potential of DDQ is closer to that
of the sc-tubes. The addition of a small amount of DDQ selectively
p-dopes the larger-diameter tubes, and the small-diameter tubes are
extracted first, which agrees well with the photoluminescence titration
results.35,47,48 Although BPO
is a stronger p-dopant than DDQ because of its oxidation potential,
it dopes all of the sc-tubes, and no chiral selectivity is observed
during the CPE.49

Clearly, the yield
and selectivity can be effectively adjusted
by adding dopants in the middle region, as shown in Figure 4, where the Fermi level of
the system is located between 4.47 eV (neutral state for the SWCNTs)
and ∼5.0 eV (medium p-doping). Fortunately, the CPE under ambient
conditions is located within the desired region with a high selectivity
and median yield. Interestingly, in 0.64 mM BPO, the total yield of
the first four extractions is only 0.4%, which means that almost all
of the tubes form bundles and precipitate out at this doping level.
These results demonstrate that the p-doping level of the sc-tubes
determines their bundling tendency and solubility in the PFDD/toluene
solution. For the m-tubes, the change in their electrical properties
is less pronounced within this range because of their continuous electric
density of state.20,23

We propose that the separation
mechanism of the CPE process can
be rationalized by considering the electric properties and polarizability
of the m/sc-tubes.50,51 The doping level is determined
by both the redox potential of the dopants and their concentration,
and it may also be related to the thermal distribution of the electrons.52 In the highly n/p-doped state, electrostatic
repulsions dominate and both the m/sc-tubes are extracted without
any selectivity. In the medium p-doped to neutral state range, the
m-tubes have a very low solubility and the solubility of the sc-tubes
is related to their p-doping level, which is determined by their diameters/chiralities
and the redox potential and the concentration of the dopants. With
an adequate p-doping level, the sc-tubes have enough positive charge
to preferentially induce polar–polar interactions with the
m-tubes, which have a 103–105 times larger
polarizability, leading to selective bundling and sc-SWCNT enrichment.53,54 Previously, we reported that m-tubes show a stronger affinity to
a polar silica gel surface, which agrees with the observation here.55 The bundling energy between the tubes is very
sensitive to their doping level and careful consideration of the doping
level can provide better control of the electrical-type and/or diameter
selectivity.38

In these experiments,
PFDD acts like a neutral polymer and charge
transfers are not observed between it and carbon nanotubes. We propose
that control of the bundling/energy level is more important than polymer
adsorption in a CPE process in this case.18,56−58 However, for other polymers that contain electron-donating
or -withdrawing groups or charges, the charge transfer must be considered
in their interactions with the tubes.59,60 This type
of interaction is similar to that observed for the dopants and dramatically
influences the CPE process, as recently reported by Adronov et al.61 To further test the doping effect on the CPE
of other polymers/SWCNTs systems, we used PFDD on CoMoCAT and P3DDT
on HiPCO samples. The representative absorption curves are shown in Figure S10 (Supporting Information). Clearly,
addition of p-/n-dopants will dramatically influence both the yield
and chirality of SWCNT/polymer dispersions in the obtained supernatants.
Several key parameters have to be considered here: diameters and initial
doping states of raw SWCNT materials, polymer structures that define
their interaction with SWCNTs, and the energy level of the whole system,
which can be affected by addition of p-/n-dopants.

3 Conclusions
In conclusion, we studied the effects of dopants
on the enrichment
of SWCNT materials using a CPE process. At very high p-/n-doping levels,
the static repulsions between the highly charged tubes dominate their
interactions and the CPE process loses its selectivity. In the medium
p-doping to neutral range, the CPE process can be efficiently modulated
via the addition of n/p-dopants with a balance between the yield and
the sc-purity. The dispersibility of the tubes is determined by their
bundling energy, which can be further explained by their doping level.
The differentiation of the sc/m-tubes comes from their electric properties
and polarizabilities. We believe that this redox-modulated sorting
can also work for other types of SWCNTs and polymer systems because
it is sensitive only to the tube redox potentials and the bundling
tendency between the tubes. This input enhances our understanding
of the CPE mechanism and benefits the commercial production of SWCNT
materials by allowing for better control of the yield or chirality.
