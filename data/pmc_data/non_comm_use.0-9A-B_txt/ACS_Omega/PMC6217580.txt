The major bottleneck in the current
chemotherapy treatment of cancer
is the low bioavailability and high cytotoxicity. Targeted delivery
of drug to the cancer cells can reduce the cytotoxicity and increase
the bioavailability. In this context, microbubbles are currently being
explored as drug-delivery vehicles to effectively deliver drug to
the tumors or cancerous cells. Microbubbles when used along with ultrasound
can enhance drug uptake and inhibit the growth of tumor cells. Several
potential anticancer molecules exhibit poor water solubility, which
limits their use in therapeutic applications. Such poorly water soluble
molecules can be coadministered with microbubbles or encapsulated
within or loaded on the microbubbles surface, to enhance the effectiveness
of these molecules against cancer cells. Curcumin is one of such potential
anticancer molecules obtained from the rhizome of herbal spice, turmeric.
In this work, curcumin-loaded protein microbubbles were synthesized
and examined for effective in vitro delivery of curcumin to HeLa cells.
Microbubbles in the size range of 1–10 μm were produced
using perfluorobutane as core gas and bovine serum albumin (BSA) as
shell material and were loaded with curcumin. The amount of curcumin
loaded on the microbubble surface was estimated using UV–vis
spectroscopy, and the average curcumin loading was found to be ∼54
μM/108 microbubbles. Kinetics of in vitro curcumin
release from microbubble surface was also estimated, where a 4-fold
increase in the rate of curcumin release was obtained in the presence
of ultrasound. Sonication and incubation of HeLa cells with curcumin-loaded
BSA microbubbles enhanced the uptake of curcumin by ∼250 times.
Further, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide
assay confirmed ∼71% decrease in cell viability when HeLa cells
were sonicated with curcumin-loaded microbubbles and incubated for
48 h.

Introduction
Researchers are exploring
targeted and efficient delivery of anticancer
drug molecules to tumor cells to minimize the damage caused to healthy
cells.1 Drug carriers such as microbubbles
(MBs) can be used to achieve this, as microbubbles have been successfully
demonstrated for a localized drug delivery to cancer cells.2−9 Microbubbles can be loaded with drug by direct binding to its surface,10 binding through ligand,11,12 or encapsulating drug/gene inside the gaseous core.13,14 Since microbubbles consist of a compressible gaseous core, ultrasound
can be used to manipulate the microbubble behavior in aqueous medium,15−18 e.g., ultrasound can be used to burst microbubbles,19 a phenomenon which can be exploited for local and targeted
delivery of drugs/genes using microbubbles3,5,14 or even to deliver drug molecules across
the blood–brain barrier.20,21 Such strategies help
reduce damage caused to the healthy cells.

In this paper, results
from studies related to the synthesis of
protein microbubbles loaded with curcumin and their effectiveness
in enhancing the curcumin uptake by HeLa cells have been reported.
Curcumin, a naturally occurring molecule, derived from the rhizome
of an herbal spice, turmeric, is known to possess anticancer properties.22−25 However, curcumin suffers from poor aqueous solubility and hence
low bioavailability.22 Therefore, an efficient
way of curcumin delivery (such as loading the drug cargo directly
on drug-delivery vehicles) needs to be adopted (rather than traditional
drug-delivery routes) to enhance its effectiveness against cancer
cells. At present, delivery of curcumin to H22 tumors in the form
of nanoparticles encapsulated within the core of microbubbles or as
a coadministration along with microbubbles (Sonovue) to MDA-MB-231
cancer cells26 has been studied. However,
in this work, curcumin was directly loaded on the microbubble surface.
Microbubbles were synthesized using bovine serum albumin (BSA) as
shell material and perfluorobutane (PFB) as core gas. Curcumin uptake
by HeLa cells was found to increase, and the cell viability was found
to reduce significantly when curcumin-loaded BSA microbubbles (CuB
MBs) were used along with ultrasound. This is the first report where
microbubbles with curcumin loaded on the microbubble surface have
been used for delivery of curcumin to HeLa cells. Further, we show
that curcumin-loaded microbubbles when combined with ultrasound can
significantly reduce the concentration of curcumin needed to decrease
the cell viability.

Results and Discussion
Interaction between Curcumin
and BSA
To verify the
complex formation between curcumin and BSA, UV–vis and fluorescence
spectrophotometry techniques were used. Figure 1A shows UV–vis spectra for  a
BSA solution containing varying curcumin concentrations. It can
be clearly seen from Figure 1A that each spectrum (except the spectrum for only BSA) contains
two distinct peaks, at around 278 and 425 nm, corresponding to BSA
and curcumin.27 As the concentration of
curcumin in the solution increases, the peak intensity corresponding
to curcumin as well as BSA increases. The appearance of two distinct
peaks in the absorption spectra with an increase in curcumin concentration
is an indication of complex formation.27Figure 1B shows fluorescence
spectra obtained from curcumin–BSA solution. The curcumin spectra
are not shown in Figure 1B as curcumin does not show any fluorescence at the excitation frequency
of 295 nm.28 The spectra (in Figure 1B) show fluorescence emission
of BSA molecules, which are mainly attributed to Trp amino acids present
in BSA molecule (Trp134 and Trp213) and especially Trp213 present
in the hydrophobic cleft. It was observed that the fluorescence intensity
decreases with an increase in concentration of curcumin. These changes
in fluorescence intensity can be attributed to the interaction of
curcumin with BSA. Curcumin molecule enters the hydrophobic cavity
of BSA molecule, where Trp213 is present, and then binds with BSA
molecule at this position through hydrophobic interactions, which
hinders the fluorescence emission.27,29

curcumin concentrations and (B) fluorescence spectra of protein solution
containing different curcumin concentrations.

Synthesis and Characterization of Microbubbles
Figure 2A shows optical microscopy
image, and Figure 2B shows size distribution of size-isolated (1–10 μm)
curcumin-loaded BSA microbubbles. The size-isolated microbubble population
was obtained from freshly prepared polydisperse microbubbles (with
size ranging from submicron to 20 μm or more) using the differential
centrifugation process, as described by Feshitan et al.30 These size-isolated (1–10 μm) curcumin-loaded
BSA microbubbles were then stored in a solution containing curcumin–BSA
solution (80% v/v), 1,2-propanediol (10% v/v), and glycerol (10% v/v)
(PGO) for further analysis and used in drug uptake and cell culture
studies. Long-term stability studies were not carried out for these
microbubbles as in our earlier work,31 and
protein microbubbles were found to be stable for ∼8 months.
Further, the curcumin-loaded BSA microbubbles were stable for at least
1 day in suspension media.

of curcumin-loaded
BSA microbubbles. The inset in (B) shows a photo of curcumin-loaded
BSA microbubbles suspension.

Estimation of Average Curcumin Loading per Microbubble and in
Vitro Release of Curcumin
The amount of curcumin loaded on
 microbubbles was calculated by the quantification method
described in Methods. On the basis of the
UV–vis absorbance data, curcumin loading was found to be ∼54
μM/108 microbubbles. Figure 3 shows profiles of curcumin release from
curcumin-loaded BSA microbubbles when microbubbles were mixed with
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (maintained at 37 °C) in the
presence and absence of ultrasound. About 50% of the total curcumin
was released within the first 1 h and roughly 90% of the curcumin
was released from microbubbles by the end of 4 h when the solution
was subjected to ultrasound (1 MHz, 0.5 W/cm2, and 5 s).
On the other hand, when no ultrasound was used, only ∼14% of
curcumin was released in 1 h and only ∼30% curcumin was released
in 4 h from microbubbles. Thus, it is clear that the use of ultrasound
accelerates release of curcumin from the microbubble surface and hence
the overall % curcumin release increases with the use of ultrasound.
It should be noted that ultrasound might burst some of the microbubbles
and some microbubbles could even dissolve. However, as mentioned in
the previous section, most of the microbubbles remain stable over
a long period of time.

Figure 3 % Cumulative curcumin release from curcumin-loaded BSA
microbubbles
in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) maintained at 37 °C. After
60 min, about 50% of curcumin was released when ultrasound was used,
whereas only ∼14% of curcumin was released when ultrasound
was not used.

In Vitro Curcumin Uptake
by HeLa Cells
As stated in
Methods, the operating parameters were optimized for maximum drug
uptake by HeLa cells. Figure 4 shows the variation in drug uptake by HeLa cells when three
different cell-to-microbubbles ratios, viz., 100:1, 1:1, and 1:100,
and six sonication exposure times, viz., 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30
s, were used.

Figure 4 Variation in curcumin uptake by HeLa cells when ∼106 cells were treated with varying concentrations of curcumin-loaded
BSA microbubbles (CuB MBs) (100:1, 1:1, and 1:100) and varying ultrasonic
exposure times. Data in the above figure are means ± standard
deviation (SD) of three independent experiments. The error bars are
two-tailed, where **p < 0.005, ***p < 0.0004.

HeLa cells were mixed
with microbubbles, sonicated, and were incubated
for 24 h. Ultrasound with 1 MHz frequency and 1.5 W/cm2 intensity was used and sonication was carried out for 5, 10, 15,
20, 25, and 30 s. It can be observed in Figure 4 that curcumin uptake increases at all ultrasonic
exposure times with a decrease in cell-to-microbubble ratio. This
can be attributed to an increase in the curcumin payload as a decrease
in cell-to-microbubble ratio increases microbubble number per cell.
It should also be noted that the values of fluorescence in Figure 4 are low. This could
be attributed to the cell death due to sonication at an intensity
of 1.5 W/cm2. Since the fluorescence measured corresponds
to live cells only, the values of fluorescence reported in Figure 4 are low. However,
a maximum curcumin uptake was obtained at a cell-to-microbubbles ratio
of 1:100, and hence, all further experiments were conducted at this
ratio.

Figure 5 shows a
variation in curcumin uptake by HeLa cells when they were exposed
to different ultrasound intensities (0, 0.5, 1, and 1.5 W/cm2) at varying exposure times (5, 10, and 15 s). The cell-to-microbubble
ratio was kept constant at 1:100. It can be observed from Figure 5 that the curcumin
uptake was maximum at the ultrasound intensity of 0.5 W/cm2 and exposure time of 5 s. Further, it can also be observed that
an increase in ultrasonic intensity beyond 0.5 W/cm2 decreases
the amount of drug uptake by the cells. This could be attributed to
the likely cell death by ultrasound at ultrasonic intensities higher
than 0.5 W/cm2. The cell samples were washed (as per standard
protocol) before the analysis, resulting in the washing out of the
dead cells, which did not adhere to the walls of wells in the cell
culture plate. Since only live cells were analyzed for cellular uptake,
the overall uptake shows a decrease in total curcumin uptake.

Figure 5 Variation in
curcumin uptake by HeLa cells when ∼106 cells were
treated with ∼108 curcumin-loaded
BSA microbubbles (cell-to-microbubble ratio of 1:100) with varying
ultrasonic intensity and sonication time. Data in above figure are
means ± SD of three independent experiments. All of the error
bars are two-tailed. ****p < 0.0001 compared to
respective control data set (at I = 0 W/cm2).

On the basis of these observations,
the final curcumin uptake experiment
was conducted at the following optimized parameters: cell-to-microbubble
ratio, 1:100; ultrasonic intensity, 0.5 W/cm2; and ultrasonic
exposure time, 5 s. Figure 6 shows relative fluorescence of the curcumin uptake by HeLa
cells. The untreated HeLa cells (no ultrasound, no curcumin, and no
microbubbles) were used as control. It can be observed from Figure 6 that the uptake
of curcumin in the case of HeLa cells sonicated with a mixture of
aqueous solution of curcumin and BSA microbubbles was found to be
about ∼3-fold higher than that for HeLa cells sonicated only
with aqueous solution of curcumin (no microbubbles). The uptake of
curcumin increases significantly, by ∼250-folds when HeLa cells
(∼106) were sonicated with curcumin-loaded microbubbles.
This indicates that curcumin-loaded BSA microbubbles are highly effective
than the bare (unloaded) microbubbles coadministered with curcumin
solution in enhancing the uptake of curcumin by HeLa cells. Further,
it should be noted that the values of fluorescence due to curcumin
uptake reported in Figure 6 are higher than the values reported in Figures 4 and 5. This could
be because the curcumin uptake experiments reported in Figure 6 were conducted at the optimum
conditions of US intensity (0.5 W/cm2) and cell-to-microbubble
ratio (1:100), where the highest curcumin uptake was observed (as
presented in Figures 4 and 5).

Figure 6 Variation in curcumin uptake by HeLa cells.
Sonication with intensity
of 0.5 W/cm2 and exposure time of 5 s was used for all
samples except control. Cell-to-microbubble ratio used was 1:100.
The cells were incubated for 24 h with different samples. Control
indicates untreated HeLa cells (no ultrasound, no curcumin, and no
microbubbles), only cells indicates sonicated HeLa cells (treated
with ultrasound but no curcumin or microbubbles), and CuB indicates
curcumin-loaded BSA microbubbles. Data are means ± SD of three
independent experiments. The error bars are two-tailed. *p < 0.05, ***p < 0.001 and ns means nonsignificant
compared to control.

Sonication of cells in the presence of microbubbles results
in
sonoporation of the cell membrane. The pores generated in the cell
membrane by sonoporation are mostly transient and re-seal within ∼20
s.32 The drug uptake therefore has to take
place within this short time. Sonicating HeLa cells with only curcumin
solution does not result in a higher curcumin uptake since curcumin
molecules have to diffuse through the surrounding medium as well as
cell cytoplasm when the pores are open for a very short duration.
The slow process of diffusion and quick re-sealing of sonoporated
cell membrane result in a lower uptake of curcumin. However, in the
case of curcumin-loaded BSA microbubbles, the rupture of curcumin-loaded
microbubbles results in a higher curcumin concentration just next
to the cell wall. Sonoporation of cell membrane followed by quick
diffusion of these large number of available curcumin molecules along
with tiny fragments of microbubbles shell loaded with curcumin molecules
results into a quick and higher curcumin uptake by HeLa cells.10,33

In Vitro Cell Viability of HeLa Cells
Figure 7 presents variation in % cell
viability when HeLa cells were sonicated with only curcumin solution,
a mixture of curcumin solution and BSA microbubbles, and curcumin-loaded
BSA microbubbles. HeLa cells without any treatment were considered
as a control. All of the samples except the control were subjected
to sonication. The cells were incubated for 48 h after sonication.
3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT)
assay was used to estimate % cell viability. As is evident from Figure 7, when only sonication
was used, cell viability reduced to ∼66%. Further reduction
in cell viability was obtained for HeLa cells sonicated with only
curcumin solution (in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium
(DMEM)). In this case, the viability of HeLa cells was found to reduce
to ∼51%. A significant decrease in cell viability (about a
71% decrease in live cells) was obtained when cells were sonicated
with curcumin-loaded BSA microbubbles (Figure 7). To achieve the similar reduction in cell
viability, about 100 μM of curcumin would be needed if only
curcumin (no microbubbles) is used (see Figure S1).

Figure 7 Cell viability of HeLa cells when subjected to curcumin and microbubbles
samples (cell-to-microbubble ratio, 1:100) and incubated for 48 h.
Control indicates untreated (no ultrasound, no curcumin, and no microbubbles)
HeLa cells, only cells indicates sonicated HeLa cells (but no curcumin
or microbubbles), and CuB indicates curcumin-loaded BSA microbubbles.
All of the samples except the control were subjected to sonication
for 5 s at an intensity of 0.5 W/cm2. Data are means ±
SD of three independent experiments. The error bars are two-tailed.
*p < 0.05, ***p < 0.0005 and
****p < 0.0001 and ns means nonsignificant.

Thus, it is clear that curcumin-loaded
microbubbles when combined
with ultrasound can significantly reduce the concentration of curcumin
needed to decrease the cell viability. This could be attributed to
the curcumin-loaded microbubbles being much more efficient in enhancing
the drug uptake due to their rupture upon exposure to ultrasound,
thereby reducing the cell viability

Conclusions
Curcumin-loaded
BSA microbubbles were synthesized using aqueous
ethanolic solution containing BSA and curcumin and PFB as core gas.
The curcumin–BSA conjugation was confirmed through fluorescence
and UV–vis studies. A probe sonication technique was used to
prepare a polydisperse microbubble suspension, and a differential
centrifugation technique was used to obtain a narrow-sized microbubble
population in the range of 1–10 μm (in diameter). The
amount of curcumin loaded on microbubbles was estimated using UV–vis
spectrophotometry and was found to be ∼54 μM/108 microbubble. The kinetics of in vitro curcumin release in PBS (heated
at 37 °C) from curcumin-loaded microbubbles was also estimated.
About 50% of curcumin was released in 1 h and ∼90% curcumin
within 4 h when microbubbles were subjected to ultrasound. On the
other hand, only 14% of curcumin was released in the first 1 h and
30% curcumin was released in 4 h when ultrasound was not used. Curcumin
uptake studies confirmed that microbubbles along with ultrasound can
effectively enhance the curcumin uptake by HeLa cells. The curcumin
uptake was enhanced by ∼250 times when HeLa cells were subjected
to ultrasound in the presence of curcumin-loaded microbubbles compared
to HeLa cells sonicated only with curcumin solution. In vitro cell
viability studies showed that curcumin-loaded BSA microbubbles were
highly effective in reducing cell viability. Only about ∼29%
HeLa cells survived after 48 h when treated with curcumin-loaded BSA
microbubbles and ultrasound. Thus, in this work, we have shown that
a curcumin-loaded protein (BSA) microbubble formulation can be used
along with ultrasound to efficiently deliver a low bioavailable drug
to HeLa cells.

Materials
BSA, N-acetyl-dl-tryptophan (Tryp), and
curcumin were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, India. Perfluorobutane
(PFB) gas was purchased from SynQuest Laboratories. Phosphate buffer
tablets were bought from Sigma-Aldrich, India, to prepare a 10 mM
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) solution. HeLa cells were obtained
from National Center for Cell Science, Pune, India. Fetal bovine serum,
trypsin phosphate versene glucose (TPVG), and Dulbecco’s modified
Eagle’s medium (DMEM) were bought from Gibco. Corning 6-well
and 96-well cell culture plates (transparent and black), 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide (MTT), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), and methanol were purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich, India. All of the plastic wares used for cell
culture work (6-well, 96-well plates, scrapper, and 25 cm2 flasks) were purchased from Corning, and Sigma-Aldrich, India.

Methods
Understanding
Curcumin–BSA Interaction
Curcumin
solutions with different molar concentrations (1.25–40 μM)
were prepared in ethanol. A protein solution containing BSA (30 mg/mL)
and Tryp (9.8 mg/mL) in PBS was used as a base medium. Ethanolic solution
of curcumin and BSA solution in PBS were mixed in 5:95 (v/v) ratio
to avoid precipitation of curcumin particles. The curcumin–BSA
mixture was stirred continuously for around 4 h. These solutions were
then centrifuged at 14 000 rpm for 10 min and vacuum-filtered
to obtain yellowish transparent solutions.

Interaction of curcumin
with BSA was investigated by UV absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy.
Protein solutions without and with different curcumin concentrations
were analyzed using a Shimadzu UV–vis spectrophotometer. Fluorescence
emission studies were also carried out on a Horiba Jobin Yvon Fluorolog-3
spectrofluorometer with a slit width of 1 nm. The protein solution
was analyzed for changes in fluorescence spectra with an excitation
frequency of 295 nm, while emission spectra were collected between
310 and 500 nm with an optical path length of 1 cm. The excitation
frequency of 295 nm was used mainly to detect fluorescence emission
of tryptophan amino acids (Trp134 and Trp213) present in BSA molecules.
Since binding site for curcumin on BSA molecule is also in the vicinity
of Trp213,24,34 any change in fluorescence of
BSA can be attributed to the curcumin interaction with the BSA molecule.27

Production of Curcumin-Loaded Microbubbles
Protein
microbubbles were produced using a solution of BSA (30 mg/mL) and N-acetyl-dl-tryptophan (Tryp) (9.8 mg/mL) dissolved
in 30 mL of 10 mM PBS.31,35 This protein solution was mixed
vigorously using a magnetic stirrer until all of the added Tryp dissolved
completely and solution turned transparent. An excess of curcumin
(about 100 mg/mL) was added to ethanol and stirred continuously for
about 1 h. Undissolved curcumin was removed from the solution by centrifuging
at 14 000 rpm for 30 min and the infranatant was filtered using
a syringe filter to obtain a clear solution. This solution was then
added slowly to the protein solution to maintain a volume ratio of
5:95. This ratio was chosen as it does not precipitate curcumin in
the solution. This BSA–curcumin solution was then stirred for
around 4 h at 500 rpm. No precipitation of curcumin or BSA was observed
and a clear transparent solution was obtained. The solution was heated
up to ∼69 °C under continuous moderate stirring (∼500
rpm). A probe of half-inch diameter (VC 750 Sonics) was placed at
the surface of the heated solution and operated at 100% amplitude
for ca. 8–10 s with PFB gas being flown over the solution.
The sonication produced a yellowish milky suspension containing microbubbles
and foam. This suspension was immediately air-sealed and kept in an
ice bath (4 °C) for nearly 30 min. The microbubble suspension
was analyzed for size distribution and concentration using Accusizer
780 AD (PSS NICOMP). The as-prepared microbubble suspension was polydisperse
in nature and contained microbubbles with size (diameter) varying
from submicron scale (<1 μm) to more than 20 μm. This
suspension was subjected to centrifugal size isolation29,30 to obtain microbubble suspension with a size range of 1–10
μm. To size-isolate the microbubbles, a freshly prepared polydisperse
microbubble suspension was collected in 30 mL syringes and was subjected
to centrifugation at 300 rcf for 3 min. The microbubble cake thus
obtained was diluted with PBS (to a total volume of 30 mL) and centrifuged
at 60 rcf for 1 min to remove microbubbles smaller than 1 μm
(in infranatant). The resultant cake (with microbubbles of size larger
than 1 μm) was diluted with PBS (to a total volume of 30 mL)
and subjected to 70 rcf for 1 min. The infranatant obtained after
this step (which contains microbubbles <10 μm) was subjected
to centrifugation at 90 rcf for 1 min to obtain a cake containing
microbubble population with size ranging between 1 and 10 μm.
This cake was then resuspended in 2 mL of PBS to obtain a microbubble
suspension with 1–10 μm microbubbles and analyzed for
size distribution and concentration using Accusizer 780 AD (PSS NICOMP).

Quantification of Curcumin-Loaded on the Microbubble Surface
Curcumin–BSA microbubbles (∼108 MBs) were
added to 1 mL of ethanol and centrifuged at 14 000 rpm for
10 min. Addition of ethanol dissolves curcumin loaded on the microbubble
surface. Curcumin concentration in ethanol was estimated by measuring
UV absorbance (at 425 nm) of the supernatant obtained after centrifugation.

In Vitro Curcumin Release from Microbubbles
The kinetics
of curcumin release from microbubble (MB) surface, with and without
sonication, was studied by UV–vis spectrophotometry for sonicated
and nonsonicated samples. Two sets of samples containing 5 ×
108 curcumin-loaded BSA microbubbles in 5 mL of PBS solution
(maintained at 37 °C) were prepared by adding a calculated amount
of microbubbles from a microbubble suspension containing about 109 microbubbles/mL. One set of sample was sonicated at an ultrasonic
intensity of 0.5 W/cm2 for 5 s using Electroson 608 ultrasonic
system with 1 MHz mean frequency in 1:1 pulse mode (2 ms ON and 2
ms OFF cycle). The other set of sample, having the same number of curcumin-loaded
BSA microbubbles, was not subjected to sonication. Around 20 μL
of sample was pipetted out from each of the above solutions at an
interval of 15 min and was analyzed by UV–vis spectroscopy.
At the same time, 20 μL of stock PBS solution was added back
into the solution to maintain the volume of solution constant. In
vitro release studies were conducted for about 5 h.

Uptake of Curcumin
by HeLa Cells
Around 0.5 ×
106 HeLa cells were seeded in six-well plates and incubated
for 24 h at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere with a continuous
supply of 5% CO2. Optimization of operating parameters
such as cell-to-microbubble concentration ratio, ultrasonic intensity,
and ultrasonic exposure time was carried out using curcumin uptake
by HeLa cells. Three different cell-to-curcumin-loaded BSA (CuB) MB
ratios (100:1, 1:1, and 1:100) were used. All of these samples except
control were sonicated at ultrasonic intensities of 0.5, 1, and 1.5
W/cm2 and ultrasonic exposure times of 5, 10 and 15 s.
HeLa cells without microbubbles and without sonication were used as
control. After treatment, the samples were incubated further for 24
h.

Following the incubation, the cells were washed with PBS
and treated with 1 mL of TPVG for 2 min. TPVG was decanted, 1 mL of
PBS was added to each well, and the cells were collected using scrappers
in 2 mL centrifuge vials. The cells were centrifuged at 1500g for 10 min, and the supernatant was discarded. The cell
pellet obtained was resuspended in 500 μL of methanol and subjected
to a probe sonication cycle of 10 s ON/20 s OFF three times for cell
lysis and to extract curcumin in methanol solution. The lysed cell
solution was further centrifuged at 1500g for 10
min, and the supernatant was transferred to Thermo Fisher Nunc flat-bottom
96-well black polystyrene plates. The fluorescence intensity was measured
using a Thermo Fisher Varioskan Flash multimode reader with an emission
wavelength of 570 nm. Cells without curcumin-loaded BSA microbubbles
and without sonication were used as controls.

To estimate the
actual curcumin uptake by HeLa cells in the presence
of curcumin-loaded BSA microbubbles and therapeutic ultrasound, a
similar procedure was adopted. HeLa cells were incubated (in six-well
plate) with different samples, namely, curcumin dissolved in DMEM
(saturated solution), saturated curcumin solution with only BSA MBs,
and curcumin-loaded BSA microbubbles. The number of microbubbles in
each sample was kept constant at 108/well. Further, the
amount of curcumin in each sample was kept constant at 54 μM
(equal to the amount of curcumin loaded on 108 curcumin-loaded
BSA (CuB) microbubbles). For each of the above samples, two different
cell culture plates were prepared. One plate was subjected to sonication
and was labeled as treated. The other plate was not subjected to ultrasound
and was labeled as untreated. The optimized operating parameters such
as cell-to-curcumin-loaded BSA microbubble ratio of 1:100, ultrasonic
intensity of 0.5 W/cm2, and ultrasonic exposure time of
5 s were used during these experiments. The treated and untreated
cells were then incubated for 24 h and analyzed as explained in the
above paragraph to estimate curcumin uptake by the HeLa cells.

In Vitro
Cell Viability Assay
Curcumin-loaded BSA microbubbles
were evaluated for their cytotoxicity on HeLa cells using MTT assay
protocol as described earlier. Microbubble concentration added to
different wells was kept constant at ∼106 MBs/well
for all formulations (to maintain a cell-to-microbubble ratio of 1:100).
The concentration of curcumin in each sample was also kept constant
at ∼0.54 μM (which corresponds to the concentration of
curcumin loaded on surface of ∼106 microbubbles).
Also, about 10 μM curcumin dissolved in DMSO was added to each
well to increase the overall concentration of curcumin. Two sets of
cell culture samples were prepared in a manner similar to that discussed
in “Uptake of Curcumin by HeLa Cells”. After an incubation period of 24 h, when cell confluency
was ∼90%, microbubbles were added to the wells of cell culture
plates. While one plate was sonicated (labeled as treated) for 5 s
at an intensity of 0.5 W/cm2, the other plate was not sonicated
(labeled as untreated). The cell culture plates were then kept for
incubation for 48 h at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere with
5% CO2 supply.

After incubation, the plates (treated
and untreated) were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and
∼200 μL of MTT solution (5 mg/mL) was added to each well.
The cells were then incubated at 37 °C in the dark for 3 h. Following
incubation, the plates were centrifuged at 1500g for
10 min at room temperature. The supernatant was removed following
the incubation, and 200 μL of DMSO was added to each well. The
cell viability was calculated following UV–vis absorbance at
570 nm.

Statistical Analysis
The statistical analysis was performed
on the experimental mean data obtained from at least three independent
observations. The standard deviations are shown as error bars (±)
in respective figures. The comparison between two mean values for
statistical significance was made by performing a one-way analysis
of variance.
