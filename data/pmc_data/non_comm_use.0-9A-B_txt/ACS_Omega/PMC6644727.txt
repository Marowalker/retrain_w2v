Printable
piezoelectric sensors were fabricated on a flexible polyethylene
terephthalate (PET) substrate. Solution-processed piezoelectric poly(vinylidenefluoride-co-trifluoroethylene) ink was used as an active layer. Evaporated
silver on PET was used as the bottom electrode and the painted silver
glue as the top electrode. The sensors were poled using a high dc
electric field from 25 to 65 MV m–1, yielding piezoelectric
normal direction sensitivities up to 25 pC N–1.
Bending-mode sensitivities showed values up to 200 nC N–1, which is 4 orders of magnitude larger than the force sensitivity
in the normal direction. The high bending-mode sensitivities suggest
suitability for detecting small forces, such as single fiber bonds
or cardiomyocyte cell-beating force.

1 Introduction
Polyvinylidenefluoride
(PVDF) is a piezoelectric viscoelastic,
semicrystalline material that generates a charge when it is mechanically
deformed. PVDF and its copolymers, especially with trifluoroethylene
(TrFE), have become important piezoelectric materials for sensor applications.1 There are several applications in the fields
of mechanical (such as pressure, acceleration, vibration, and tactile
sensors), acoustics, and infrared radiation sensors.2 Other application areas include, for example, energy conversion
and harvesting,3,4 touch panels,5 resistive switching devices,6 and physiological measurement.7 Recently,
biological materials such as wood-based nanocellulose,8 bacterial nanocellulose,9 and
chitosan10 have been demonstrated as piezoelectric
materials, but their piezoelectric response still remains weaker than
PVDF and its copolymers.

Conventionally, piezoelectric PVDF
films are manufactured by bringing
the PVDF resin pellets into a sheet form with melt extrusion and stretching
the sheet.11 Different crystal phases exist
in PVDF: the alpha phase is the most stable phase at room temperature,
whereas the β phase shows the highest piezoelectric effect.12,13 Stretching at a temperature below the melting point causes chain
packaging of the molecules into parallel crystal planes (β phase).11 These electric dipole moments are randomly oriented
and result in zero net polarization.12 In
the poling stage, the stretched polymer is exposed to a high electric
field to generate piezoelectric properties.11 The poling procedure, in general, consists of applying an electric
field for a certain period of time.14 The
molecular dipoles are oriented in the direction of the electric field,
and an overall net polarization is obtained for the film.12 The printable copolymer poly(vinylidenefluoride-co-trifluoroethylene) [P(VDF-TrFE)], which is prepared by
copolymerization of TrFE and vinylidene, can be poled with a similar
method.15

PVDF and P(VDF-TrFE) are
both semicrystalline polymers: they are
comprised of ordered regions of monomer units, crystallites, surrounded
by amorphous chains.15 The P(VDF-TrFE)
polymer has some advantages when compared to PVDF: with P(VDF-TrFE),
the β phase can be obtained directly by adding a copolymer,
and only poling using electric field is necessary for piezoelectricity
and no stretching is needed.16,17 In addition, the crystallinity,
remanent polarization, and temperature stability of P(VDF-TrFE) are
higher than those of PVDF.16

Some
methods to fabricate P(VDF-TrFE) sensors have been reported
previously. Haque et al. developed inkjet-printed films using high-molecular-weight
P(VDF-TrFE).18 They used a modified waveform
and a very low jetting frequency to accommodate the relaxation time
of the polymeric ink during jetting. The films were characterized
to investigate their morphology and crystallinity. Persano et al.
fabricated and characterized pressure sensors that consist of sheets
of electrospun fibres of P(VDF-TrFE).19 Ducrot et al. studied the influence of processing parameters on
P(VDF-TrFE) piezoelectric properties.16 The influence of parameters, including poling field, poling time,
and annealing duration, of spin-coated films were studied. The fabricated
P(VDF-TrFE) thin films were used as integrated transducers in organic
microelectromechanical systems resonators. Sharma et al. microfabricated
and characterized P(VDF-TrFE)-based pressure sensors to be integrated
with a catheter for intravascular measurements.20 Lithographic-based fabrication process was used. Bhavanasi
et al. used P(VDF-TrFE) for energy harvesting.21 They reported the enhanced piezoelectric energy harvesting
performance of the bilayer films of poled P(VDF-TrFE) and graphene
oxide. Dodds et al. fabricated and characterized nanocomposite films
based on P(VDF-TrFE) and zinc oxide (ZnO) nanoparticles.22 ZnO particles were used to enhance the bulk
film piezoelectricity. Khan et al. used an all screen-printing technique
to fabricate P(VDF-TrFE) and P(VDF-TrFE)/multiwalled carbon nanotube
pressure sensors.23 Zirkl et al. demonstrated
an allprinted matrix sensor array using P(VDF-TrFE) as the sensor
ink.24 Rendl et al. used a printable piezoelectric
P(VDF-TrFE) film as an active layer in their sensors and conductive
polymer (PEDOT:PSS) and carbon as electrode materials.25,26

In this study, piezoelectric sensors were fabricated from
a printable
P(VDF-TrFE) ink on a flexible plastic substrate. Our aim was to develop
a low-cost and fast process for the fabrication of flexible piezoelectric
sensors under ambient conditions. The sensors were subsequently poled
with a high dc electric field, and their piezoelectric sensitivities
in normal and bending modes were measured. An analytical model for
a sensor operating in the bending mode was also derived here. Remarkably
high bending-mode sensitivity observed here suggests that the sensors
are suitable for very low dynamic force measurements in various applications
such as a single fiber bond or a single living cell force response
measurements.

2 Materials and Methods
2.1 Piezoelectric Coefficients
The generated
charge density in piezoelectric polymers is defined as 1  where Q is the charge developed
by the sensor, A is the conductive electrode area, d3n is the piezoelectric coefficient
for the axis of applied stress, and Xn is the stress applied in the relevant direction.
For the electrical axis, m is, in our case, always
3 because the electrodes are at the top and bottom of the film. In
the normal mode also, the mechanical axis n is 3.
In the bending mode, the electrical signal is mainly due to bending
or stretching in the lateral mode (length and width of the sensors,
mechanical axes 1 and 2).

2.2 Fabrication of P(VDF-TrFE)
Sensors
Commercial P(VDF-TrFE) ink (Solvene 250, casting
formulation, Solvay,
Belgium) with inherent piezo-, pyro-, and ferroelectric properties
were applied in the sensor application.27 This P(VDF-TrFE) ink had a VDF/TrFE molar ratio of 3:1. Table 1 lists the properties
of the ink.

P(VDF-TrFE) layer.

A transparent
and flexible polyethylene terephthalate (PET) film
(Melinex ST506) of thickness 125 μm was used as a substrate
for the sensor. To provide a bottom electrode for the sensor, a 100
nm-thick layer of silver (Ag) was vacuum-evaporated (System Control
Technologies, USA, with 880 Deposition Controller, Telemark, USA)
on PET. A mechanical shadow mask made of PET was used to obtain the
electrode pattern. The electrodes have a circular shape with a diameter
of 20 mm with branching contact areas (see Figure 1a).

Figure 1 (a) Photograph of the sensor (diameter 20 mm)
and (b) schematic
cross-sectional view of the sensor. Note that the P(VDF-TrFE) layer
and the PET substrate are transparent.

An automatic film applicator (ZAA 2300 Automatic Film Applicator,
Zehntner, Switzerland) equipped with a coating tool (UA 3000-220 Universal
Film Applicator, MTV Messtechnik, Germany) was used for deposition
of a certain thickness of the P(VDF-TrFE) ink on the PET substrate
and on the bottom electrode. To make the P(VDF-TrFE) ink viscosity
suitable for the film applicator, the ink was diluted with methyl
ethyl ketone (MEK) in a ratio of 1:2 [P(VDF-TrFE):MEK] by weight.
MEK was selected as the dilution solvent as it is the same solvent
used in the original P(VDF-TrFE) ink formulation. The universal applicator
was set to a thickness of 350 μm, which defines the wet thickness
of the ink film. For each sensor, two coated ink layers were used
to improve the sensing layer quality. The coated P(VDF-TrFE) layer
with the underlying evaporated silver electrode was then baked at
120 °C for 3 h in an oven. The P(VDF-TrFE) ink layer was deposited
on an area slightly larger than the round bottom electrode area, and
after deposition and baking, the PET substrate was cut smaller so
that the ink film fully covers the final sensor substrate, as can
be seen from Figure 1b.

A silver paint (conductive silver L100 from Kemo Electronic,
1-ethoxypropan-2-ol,
and acetone ethyl acetate were used as solvents) layer was painted
on top of the ink with a brush and used as the top electrode. Finally,
crimp connectors (Nicomatic CrimpFlex, Nicomatic, France) were used
to provide the electrical connection for the measurements. Figure 1a shows a photograph
of the fabricated sensor, and Figure 1b shows the schematic cross-sectional structure of
the sensor.

The assembled sensors were poled at room temperature
using a high
dc voltage source equipment (Spellman SL50-10, USA). This step was
done to align the dipoles with the electric field and, thus, to cause
a significant piezoelectric response.16 The sensors were poled with field strengths varying from 25 to 55
MV m–1. Each sensor was kept at this voltage for
1 h. A current limit of 100 μA was used in the voltage source.
For the poling, the samples were connected using a custom-made 3D
printed sample holder, which allows multiple sensors to be polarized
at the same time.

To estimate the thickness of the P(VDF-TrFE)
layer, the thickness d was calculated from the sensor
capacitance (d = ϵ0ϵrA/C), under the assumption that
the relative permittivity
ϵr = 14 and A = πr2. The capacitances of the sensors were measured with
a multimeter. The capacitance offset caused by the measurement wires
and the multimeter itself was subtracted from the measurement result.
The applied poling field was then calculated using the thickness that
was calculated from the capacitance. In comparison, the sensor thicknesses
were also measured using a precision micrometer screw (Insize 3101-25A,
resolution 1 μm) from seven different positions on the sensor
area (see Figure 3a).
However, because the bar-coated P(VDF-TrFE) layers were rather uneven,
it was decided to use the effective thickness calculated from the
measured capacitance for determining the poling field.

2.3 Normal Mode Sensitivity
The piezoelectric
sensitivity was measured with a shaker generating a dynamic excitation
force. The Brüel and Kjaer Mini-Shaker Type 4810 was used in
the measurements. A sinusoidal input for the shaker was provided with
a Tektronix AFG3101 function generator. A pretension, which produces
a static force, is needed to keep the sample in place and prevent
piston jumping during the measurement. A commercial, high-sensitivity
dynamic force sensor (model number 209C02, PCB Piezotronics, USA)
and a load cell (model number ELFS-T3E-20L, Measurement Specialties
Inc., USA) were used as the reference sensors for measuring the applied
dynamic and static forces. The dynamic force sensor was connected
to a sensor signal conditioner (model 442B06, PCB Piezotronics, USA). Figure 2 presents the schematic
overview of the setup.

Figure 2 Shaker setup used in piezoelectric measurements.

To measure the piezoelectric d33 coefficient,
the sample was placed horizontally on a steel table, as shown in Figure 3a. Bare PET films were placed on both sides of the sensor
to prevent direct electric contact with the bottom plate and the shaker
head. A static force of approximately 3 N between the sensor and the
shaker’s piston was adjusted to keep the sensor sample in place
during the sinusoidal dynamic excitation force of 1.3 N at 2 Hz. Measurements
were performed on seven different positions on the sample (Figure 3b) to reduce the
influence of the surface roughness of the samples and the fact that
the sample is placed under the shaker manually.

Figure 3 (a) Setup for the normal
direction force piezoelectric sensitivity
measurement. (b) Positions on a sensor used for sensitivity and thickness
measurements.

The charge generated
by the sample as a result of the excitation
force was measured with a custom-made combination of a charge amplifier
and a 16-bit AD-converter. The AD-converter also had additional channels
for sampling the voltage signals from the reference sensors. In the
measurements, a sampling rate of 1 kHz was used.

The dynamic
force sensor and the charge amplifier signals were
filtered using fast Fourier transform to remove the 50 Hz noise and
baseline drift, so that only the 2 Hz signal component remained. The
sensitivity is defined here as the charge generated by the sensor
divided by the dynamic force used to excite the sensor. Because the
excitation was sinusoidal, the calculation was done simply by dividing
the amplitudes of the respective filtered sinusoidal signals.

2.4 Bending-Mode Sensitivity
To study
the bending-mode sensitivity, the charge generated by the sensor was
measured when it was bent. The stress when bending the sensor can
be calculated using standard beam equations.28 The stress in the P(VDF-TrFE) layer is then 2  where ε1 is the strain, L is the length of the cantilever, x is
the distance from the location where the cantilever is fixed, F is the applied force, Ep is
the Young’s modulus of P(VDF-TrFE), EPET is the Young’s modulus of PET, w is the width of the PET substrate, and h is the
thickness of the PET sheet (see Figure 4). The charge in the P(VDF-TrFE) layer generated by
this stress can be obtained by combining Gauss’ law29 with the relations for describing the piezoelectric
material30 3  where D is the electric displacement
field, Se is the surface of the electrode,
and d31 (or d32) is the lateral piezoelectric coefficient mostly relevant to the
bending-mode sensor. However, there is also a slight contribution
from the coefficient d33 to the bending-mode
sensitivity, but it is here assumed to be remarkably smaller than
that of d31. For a rectangular PET substrate
with a circular electrode, this integral evaluates to form 4  where R is the radius
of
the circular electrode and z is the distance from
the neutral axis. The setup used in bending measurements is illustrated
schematically in Figure 4, and the sample holder used is shown in Figure 5.

Figure 4 Schematic view of (a) the bending measurement
setup and (b) sample
assembly.

Figure 5 Photographs of the bending measurement setup.
(a) A modified shaker
head and (b) a sample assembled into the bending measurement holder.

The bending-mode sensitivity for
each sample was measured using
different frequencies (1, 2, and 5 Hz) and different input amplitudes
applied to the shaker (400, 500, and 600 mV). These input amplitudes
resulted in physical z-direction movement amplitudes of about 0.8–1.2
mm. In total, all sensors were measured nine times.

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Yield and Thickness
The batch of
fabricated 40 samples yielded 16 functional sensors. Several reasons
were identified for a relatively large amount of nonfunctional samples.
First, the deposition of the P(VDF-TrFE) layers under ambient conditions
may lower the yield, presumably due to the appearance of dust particles
on the substrate. This causes air gaps inside the sensing layer and
decreases the dielectric strength in these locations because of the
lower breakdown field of the air in comparison to P(VDF-TrFE). Figure 6 shows the number
of survived and broken samples as a function of the poling field.
Nine samples broke during the poling.

Figure 6 Number of samples that broke down at different
poling fields.

Further, eight samples
showed a low resistance (<100 Ω)
already before poling, indicating a short circuit through the P(VDF-TrFE)
layer. This connection was removed before poling by connection a charged
capacitor to the sensor. It is expected that a capacitor provides
a large current density at the location of the short circuit, which
evaporates the silver ink at this point, removing the connection between
top and bottom electrodes. However, this treatment by a current pulse
may increase the uncertainty on these samples.

The average capacitance
of the sensors was (4.2 ± 1.2) nF.
This corresponds to an average thickness of (9.2 ± 2.8) μm,
under the assumption ϵr = 14. This permittivity value
was given by the ink manufacturer and it was considered as a good
estimate, but the real value may still be slightly different. It has
to be noticed that the wet thickness of the deposited film was much
thicker, but due to the low solid content of the ink, the final film
thickness was relatively small. The average P(VDF-TrFE) layer thickness
based on the precision micrometer screw measurement for all sensors
was (6.7 ± 2.8) μm, which is slightly smaller than the
average value calculated from the capacitance, most likely due to
the unevenness of the bar-coated films.

To determine the poling
field to polarize the samples, there are
three parameters that have to be considered: these are the poling
voltage, the poling time, and the thickness of the P(VDF-TrFE) layer.
To accurately control these parameters, the poling voltage was measured
with a multimeter, the poling time was measured with a timer, and
the thickness of the samples was estimated using the measured capacitance
data.

Ducrot et al. have studied the influence of poling conditions
on
the piezoelectric response of P(VDF-TrFE).16 They reported the necessary electric field of about 100 MV m–1 under room-temperature conditions, whereas the field
used in this study varied between 25 and 65 MV m–1. Ducrot et al. also reported that the value of the electric field
is more important than the poling time in determining the effectiveness
of the poling process of P(VDF-TrFE): the duration of only 5 min at
100 V μm–1 is sufficient to reach the maximum
level of remanent polarization and a longer poling does not bring
any advantages.16 Here, the sensors were
polarized for 1 h, as the poling field used was lower than the value
recommended. The lower poling field was used to improve the yield
as the larger poling field increased the number of sensor samples
that broke down. In addition, a few minutes of annealing is recommended
to achieve the best piezoelectric property of P(VDF-TrFE).16 Here, we did not use a separate annealing step
after the baking of the coated P(VDF-TrFE) film, but the baking temperature
we used corresponds to the recommended annealing temperature.

Generally, poling is carried out in a temperature-controlled oil
bath.17 However, we have performed the
poling in ambient air, which may decrease the breakdown voltage of
the sensors. Another reason for the decreased breakdown voltage is
the appearance of small air bubbles inside the P(VDF-TrFE) films.
Especially, as the samples were coated twice to improve the layer
quality, there may have been pinholes in one of the layers that is
covered by the other, causing a larger field at that location. Also,
the dust particles deposited from the ambient air causes air gaps
into the sensing layer, decreasing the breakdown field.

3.2 Normal Force Sensitivity
Figure 7 shows the measured
normal-mode sensitivities as a function of the poling field. Error
bars for normal-mode sensitivity, measured from seven locations from
each sensor, are relatively large for some samples, which is most
likely due to nonhomogeneity of the P(VDF-TrFE) film.

Figure 7 Measured normal-force
sensitivity as a function of the poling field,
which is derived from the capacitance under the assumption that ϵr = 14.

Concerning the yield
of functional samples, the sensors with the
normal-force sensitivity of 16.1 ± 6.1 pC N–1 had a yield of about 37% and 5.9 ± 4.6 pC N–1 had a yield of 78%. The higher poling field produced higher sensor
sensitivity values, but also increased the amount of sensors that
broke down during the poling step. Depending on the aim of future
studies, a compromise between the yield and piezoelectric response
should be made.

The normal-force sensitivity measured in this
study is closely
related to the piezoelectric d33 coefficient.
The d33 coefficient, also called the longitudinal
coefficient, describes the electrical polarization generated in the
same direction as the stress is applied.31 The d33 coefficient given for the P(VDF-TrFE)
ink by the manufacturer is 22 pC N–1 (25 μm
thick film with printed silver electrodes, poling at 200 V μm–1).27 The highest piezoelectric
normal sensitivity values obtained in this study were close to 25
pC N–1. However, the maximum sensitivity of the
samples may not have been reached as a lower poling voltage than recommended
was used.13 As can be seen from Figure 7, the saturation
of the sensor sensitivity was not reached here, and this may indicate
that the poling was not complete. With higher poling voltages, the
saturation of sensitivity could be achieved. More complete saturation
could be achieved by using ac poling instead of dc poling. The high d33 coefficient may be also partly explained
by the bending contribution: the compressibility of both the PET substrate
and the PET protection sheets may cause bending forces that increase
the measured normal-force sensitivity.

3.3 Bending-Force
Sensitivity
Figure 8 shows the measured
bending-mode sensitivities as a function of the poling field.

Figure 8 Measured bending-mode
sensitivity as a function of the poling field,
which is derived from the capacitance under the assumption that ϵr = 14.

The measured maximum
bending-mode sensitivity value (around 200
nC N–1) corresponds to the d31 coefficient of about 6 pC N–1 (calculated
from eq 4). For Young’s
modulus Ep, the literature31 value 2.05 was used in the calculation of d31, whereas for EPET, we used a value of 3.6 GPa provided by the manufacturer of the
PET film. For the P(VDF-TrFE) ink, the d31 coefficient is not given by the manufacturer. However, the d31 range of 6–12 pC N–1 has been reported for P(VDF-TrFE),31 and
the value obtained in this study is close to the minimum of that range.

The bending-mode sensitivities were further compared with normal-mode
sensitivities. Figure 9 shows the bending-mode sensitivity results as a function of the
normal-mode force sensitivity results. As can be seen, the response
is linear: the sensor having a higher normal-mode sensitivity also
has a higher bending-mode sensitivity.

Figure 9 Bending-mode sensitivity
against the normal-mode sensitivity.

The average bending sensitivity obtained for the sensors
polarized
with a field between 35–65 MV m–1 was found
to be 140 ± 50 nC N–1. However, the dependency
between the bending and normal force modes is rather linear, suggesting
that high normal force sensitivity also indicates a high bending force
sensitivity value.

A similar method based on bending force measurements
has been previously
used by Saketi et al. to measure strength in paper fiber ponds.32 They developed a microforce PVDF sensor that
operates in a cantilever-like bending mode. In the case of the printed
sensor, the substrate material mostly defines the Young’s modulus
of the sensor structure in comparison to use of the self-standing
PVDF film with thin electrodes. As an additional advantage of the
printed sensors, the sensor operation range can be fine-tuned by selecting
the desired substrate material giving certain mechanical properties.
Both in the bending and normal force sensors, the mechanical properties
of the selected substrate can be used to modify the sensor operation
range.

4 Conclusions
The
aim of this study was to develop a low-cost and fast process
for fabrication of flexible piezoelectric sensors under ambient conditions.
In addition to the sensor fabrication process, poling was also done
under ambient conditions. One should notice, however, that the fabrication
of the bottom electrode was done here by the vacuum evaporation process.
This was the only step requiring vacuum processing, but instead one
could use prepatterned or fully metallized and wet-etched bottom electrodes,
enabling sensor structure processing under ambient conditions. This
manufacturing approach is generally considered as the roll-to-roll
compatible fabrication technique.

To conclude, the solution-processed
piezoelectric sensors were
fabricated using P(VDF-TrFE) ink as an active layer. The fabricated
sensors were characterized in the normal and bending mode setups.
Normal-mode sensitivities showed values up to 25 pC N–1, whereas bending-mode sensitivities showed remarkably high values
up to 200 nC N–1. The cantilever-type bending-mode
measurement demonstrated in this study can be utilized for a low force
detection required, for example, in single fiber or living cell level
measurements.
