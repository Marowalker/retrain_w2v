Hypoxia is commonly encountered in
the tumor microenvironment and
drives proliferation, angiogenesis, and resistance to therapy. Imaging
of hypoxia is important in many disease states in oncology, cardiology,
and neurology. Finding clinically approved imaging biomarkers for
hypoxia has proved challenging. Candidate biomarkers have shown low
uptake into tumors and low signal to background ratios that adversely
affect imaging quality. Copper complexes have been identified as potential
biomarkers for hypoxia owing to their redox ability. Active uptake
of copper complexes into cells could ensure selectivity and high sensitivity.
We explored the reactivity and selectivity of the ATSM-Cu(II) biomarker
to proteins that are involved in the copper cycle using electron paramagnetic
resonance (EPR) spectroscopy and UV–vis measurements. We show
that the affinity of the ATSM-Cu(II) complex to proteins in the copper
cycle is low and the cell probably does not actively uptake ATSM-Cu(II).

Introduction
Hypoxia is an oxygen-deprived
condition of cells that is commonly
observed in cancer and in neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s
and Parkinson’s diseases.1,2 In tumors, hypoxic cells
are resistant to radiation recovery as oxygen is essential for fixation
of radiation-induced damaged DNA. Identification of hypoxic cells
plays a critical role for early diagnosis of disease conditions and
hence the prevention of disease progression.

Various molecules
have been studied as potential markers for detecting
hypoxic cells, mostly radioactive molecules that are easy to follow
using imaging techniques like positron imaging tomography (PET), magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI), and single-photon emission computed tomography
(SPECT).3 One of the most common radiotracers
for the detection of hypoxia is the nitroimidazole derivative 18F-fluromisonidazole (FMISO).4,5 The mechanism
of this radiotracer is based on the reduction of the nitrogen dioxide
group to amine in low oxygen environments. The amine complex can then
easily be trapped by proteins in the cellular environment, and the
retention time of the tracer is increased in hypoxic tissues. However,
because of their slow and passive uptake by cells, these tracers have
not been used routinely. A waiting period of 1.5 h after injection
is required to obtain a sufficient signal-to-background ratio approaching
the half-life of 18F isotope; this delay results in an
imaging time of a just few minutes.6−10

Owing to the potential of metal ions to undergo oxidation–reduction
reactions, lately, researchers have been focused on metal-based radiotracers
for high-sensitivity measurements of the cellular oxygen content. 64Cu(II) tracers,11 such as 64Cu(II)-diacetyl-bis(N4-methylthiosemicarbazone) (ATSM-64Cu(II)), have been proposed as promising PET agents for hypoxia
imaging (the copper binding structure is shown in Figure 1A).12−15 There are several advantages
to 64Cu(II) isotope labeling: (1) the half-life (12.8 h)
is not too long for patient exposure and enough time for handling
the radio compound for imaging. (2) ATSM-64Cu(II) has demonstrated
its ability to rapidly identify the hypoxic tissue owing to its small
molecular weight and its high cell membrane permeability.12,14,16 It was suggested that the ATSM-64Cu(II) tracer is actively taken up by the cell and is incorporated
in the cellular copper cycle (shown in Figure 1B) by three proteins: Ctr1, Atox1, and ATP7B,
and upon reduction at low oxygen levels (in hypoxic cells), Cu(I)
is then sequestered from the ATSM ligand and further accumulates in
the cells increasing its retention.17−20 Despite numerous studies on PET
imaging applications of copper-based radiotracers, the mechanism of
the cellular uptake of these radio-labeled copper complexes remains
unclear, and indeed, no Cu(II)-based complexes have made through clinical
trials for hypoxia imaging.

environment remain unclear. (C) Amino-terminal Cu(II)-binding (ATCUN)
motifs found in (a) human serum albumin (HSA) protein and (b) extracellular

We studied the interactions
of ATSM-Cu(II) with human copper-binding
peptides or protein under strong reducing conditions using UV–vis
and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopies. We used
the extracellular peptides DAHK (ATCUN motif of HSA)21 and NCtr1 (extracellular N-terminal of Ctr1 protein, also
an ATCUN motif) (Figure 1C) as competitive Cu(II) ligands against the ATSM ligand, as both
of the peptides play a crucial role in the copper transport mechanism.22−25 This study suggests that ATSM-Cu(II) is highly stable and is not
affected by the Cu(II)-binding peptides or by the reducing environment.
The intracellular copper protein Atox1 (human) (Figure 1D) and glutathione (GSH) may affect the reduction
of ATSM-Cu(II) through Cu(I) binding but both show low activity.

ATSM-Cu(II) Synthesis
The ligand
and complex were synthesized
as previously reported.26,27ATSM ligand: 4-Methyl-3-thiosemicarbazide
(1.2 g, 11.4 mmol) was dissolved in ethanol (50 mL) with constant
heating and stirring. Then, an ethanolic solution of diacetyl (2,3-butanedione)
(0.5 mL, 5.7 mmol) was added dropwise in the solution. Further, the
reaction mixture was added with 5–6 drops of glacial acetic
acid. Then, the reaction mixture was refluxed at 60–70 °C
for 4 h. A white-colored precipitate was formed. The flask was kept
at 4 °C overnight for complete precipitation. On the next day,
the pale, yellow precipitate of the ATSM ligand was obtained and then
washed with ethanol and diethyl ether for 3–4 times each. 1H NMR (DMSO-d6): 10.22 (s, 2H)
NH, 8.38 (m, 2H) NHCH3, 3.02 (d, 6H) NHCH3,
2.20 (s, 6H) 2xCH3. ESI-MS (+): m/z 260.4. ATSM-Cu(II) complex: The ATSM ligand (0.1 g, 0.38
mmol) was dissolved in ethanol. To this solution, the ethanolic solution
of copper acetate (0.0768 g, 0.38 mmol) was added dropwise. The color
of the solution changes from turbid white to brown red. The reaction
mixture was refluxed at 60–70 °C for 3–4 h and
then again refluxed overnight at room temperature. UV–vis spectroscopy:
λmax (DMSO) at 311 and 355 nm shoulder, 476 and 525
nm shoulder. ESI-MS (+): m/z 322.

Peptides
The peptides DAHK-NH2 and MDHSHHMGMSYMDS-NH2 (NCtr1) were synthesized on a rink amide resin. All amino
acids were protected with an Fmoc group (9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl).
The coupling was achieved with HBTU in DMF in combination with N,N-diisopropylethylamine for a 1 h cycle.
Fmoc deprotection was carried out with 30% piperidine in DMF. The
cleavage of the peptide was achieved by treating the resin-bound peptides
with a 5 mL cocktail of TFA, 5% EDT, 2.5% TIS, and 2.5% thioanisole
for 2.5 h. An additional 65 μL of TMSBr was added during the
last 30 min to minimize methionine oxidation in case of the NCtr1
peptide. The peptides were washed with cold diethyl ether, vortexed,
and then centrifuged for 5 min at 3500 rpm. The same procedure was
repeated four times. An amount of 10 mM DTT (in HPLC grade water)
was added to the NCtr1 peptide. Peptides were further purified using
preparative reversed-phase HPLC (Vydac, C18, 5 cm) and characterized
using ESI-MS.

Stock Solutions Preparation
A stock
solution of the
ATSM ligand (10 mM) was prepared in DMSO.

Stock solutions of
the peptides DAHK and NCtr1 were prepared by dissolving the powder
into Milli-Q water. The concentration of the peptides was calibrated
by Cu(II) titration in 0.1 M phosphate buffer(pH 7.4), which was monitored
by UV–vis spectroscopy the formation of the d–d band
for the 1:1 Cu(II)-peptide complex at 525 nm.28 The concentration values of peptides were as follows: [DAHK] = 10
mM, [NCtr1] = 6 mM.

A stock solution of ascorbic acid (100 mM)
was prepared freshly
in Milli-Q water. A stock solution of GSH (100 mM) was prepared freshly
in 0.1 N HCl. A stock solution of ATSM-Cu(II) (50 mM) was prepared
in 100% DMSO and then further diluted to get the required concentration.
A stock solution of Cu(II) (100 mM) was prepared in Milli-Q water
and then further diluted for the different experiments. Its concentration
was verified by UV–vis spectroscopy from the Cu(II) d–d
band at 780 nm (ε = 12 M–1 cm–1). A stock solution of phosphate buffer (100 mM, pH 7.4) was prepared
by mixing KH2PO4 in Milli-Q water and adjusted
the pH value with a solution of NaOH. A stock solution of BCA (100
mM) was prepared in Milli-Q water.

Atox1 Cloning, Expression
and Purification
The procedure
of Atox1 expression and purification was described in detail earlier.29,30 In general, the human pYTB12-Atox1 construct was kindly delivered
to us by the lab of Prof. Lutsenko (Johns Hopkins University). The
construct includes the Atox1 fusion protein with intein and chitin-binding
domains. Initially transformation to the Escherichia
coli strain BL21 (DE3) was performed. Cells were then
grown to an optical density of 0.5–0.8 at 600 nm and induced
with 1.0 mM isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for
18 h at 188 °C. Next, cells were harvested by centrifugation
and suspended in lysis buffer (25 mM Na2HPO4, 150 mM NaCl, 20 μM PMSF, pH 7.5). Purification was done using
a chitin bead column. The resin was washed with 30 column volumes
of lysis buffer. For the cleavage, the beads were incubated in 50
mM DTT, 25 mM Na2HPO4, pH 8.9, and 150 mM NaCl
for 40 h at room temperature. The eluted Atox1 was analyzed by SDS
PAGE (tricine 19%).

The concentration of Atox1 protein (7500
Da, ε280nm = 0.42 M) was determined from the absorbance
at 280 nm using a NanoDrop 2000C spectrophotometer (Thermo Fischer
Scientific).

UV–Visible Spectroscopy and Calculation
of Dissociation
Constant
UV–vis measurements were performed using
a Carry 5000 spectrometer at room temperature. Analyses were carried
out in a high-precision cell with a 10 mm optical path length cell
purchased from Hellma Analytics, except for Cu(II) titration in the
ATSM ligand, 1 mM optical path length cell was used. Binding constants
for ATSM, DAHK, and NCtr1 were calculated using a previously reported
protocol.31,32 Cu(II) titration in ligand solution was
carried out using UV–vis spectroscopy. The titration of the
ATSM ligand with Cu(II) was carried out in DMSO. The final concentration
used for ligands was 0.5 mM, and aliquots of copper (3 μL) were
subsequently added to get the desired concentration. The total volume
of the solution was 300 μL. The titration of DAHK and NCtr1
was carried out in 30% DMSO in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). The
final concentration used for ligands was 0.5 mM, and aliquots of copper
(1 μL) were subsequently added to get the desired concentration.
The total volume of the solution was 100 μL. With the addition
of Cu(II) aliquots, the d–d band appears indicating the formation
of the Cu(II) complex.

The binding constant and stoichiometry
for the complex of the interaction were obtained by fitting the observed
absorbance data at 525 nm in cases of DAHK and NCtr1 peptides while
at 475 nm for the ATSM ligand according to the following equations 1   2  where y =
[Cu(II)]/[ligand]; x = saturation fraction = n[(ligand)n–Cu(II)]/[ligand]
= (A – Ao)/(A¥ – Ao), where A, Ao, and A¥ are absorption values in the presence
of Cu(II), in the absence of Cu(II), and at saturation of Cu(II),
respectively. C is the total concentration of ligands, n is the copper-to-ligand binding stoichiometry ratio (herein,
it is one), and K is the dissociation constant (Kd).

EPR Spectroscopy
CW-EPR spectra were recorded using
an E500 Elexsys Bruker spectrometer operating at 9.0–9.5 GHz
equipped with a super-high-sensitivity CW resonator. The spectra were
recorded at low temperature (130 ± 5 K) at a microwave power
of 20.0 mW, a modulation amplitude of 1.0 G, a time constant of 80
ms, and a receiver gain of 60.0 dB. The samples were measured in 4.0
mm quartz tubes (Wilmad-LabGlass, Vineland, NJ). CW-EPR simulations
were carried out using MATLAB with the EasySpin toolbox.33

Results and Discussion
Copper is
accumulated by the cell through the main copper transporter
Ctr1 in a Cu(II) oxidation state. It was suggested that both the ATCUN
motif in the N-terminal domain of Ctr1 and the His-rich motif were
involved in Cu(II) acquisition from the blood carrier protein, human
serum albumin (HSA).23−25 Cu(II) is then reduced to a Cu(I) state and directed
by various metallochaperones to different cellular pathways: to the
Golgi, superoxide dismutase, and mitochondria. One of these metallochaperones,
Atox1, (also named Hah1)34,35 is responsible for
shuttling Cu(I) ions from Ctr1 to ATP7A/B in the Golgi. Here, we explore
the binding of ATSM-Cu(II) to the ATCUN motif found in HSA, to the
N-terminal domain of Ctr1 (NCtr1), and to the Atox1 metallochaperone.

Initially, we studied the effect of the Cu(II)-binding motifs,
ATCUNs, on the stability of ATSM-Cu(II) complex. Peptides or proteins
with the ATCUN motif have an N-terminal with a histidine residue at
a third position, and these peptides or proteins show a high affinity
toward Cu(II) and a dissociation constant reported to be in the range
of 10–12 to 10–15 M at physiological
conditions.36 The ATSM-Cu(II) complex alone
is stable under aerobic condition. The absorption spectrum of the
ATSM-Cu(II) complex in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) shows a characteristic
signature in the absorption spectrum of the copper complex of bisthiosemicarbazones
(Figure 2).37 The ATSM ligand and ATSM-Cu(II) complex are
insoluble in water and aqueous solutions. Therefore, to increase its
solubility in the buffer (here, 0.1 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.4) and,
at the same time, to match with physiological conditions, we used
30% DMSO in 0.1 M phosphate buffer as a solvent in most of our experiments.
No significant changes in the pH value of the solution were observed
before and after the reactions. The absorption spectrum of ATSM-Cu(II)
in phosphate buffer showed a blue shift in the d–d band, that
is, from 475 to 461 nm (Figure 2).

Figure 2 UV–visible spectrum of 50 μM ATSM-Cu(II) in DMSO (gray)
and 0.1 M phosphate buffer containing 30% DMSO (red).

In the presence of Cu(II) chelators or reducing
agents, a decrease
in the intensity of the d–d band would be expected, indicating
either the removal of Cu(II) from ATSM coordination or the reduction
of Cu(II) to Cu(I). However, the addition of DAHK or NCtr1 peptides
show no significant decrease in original d–d bands of ATSM-Cu(II)
at least until 20 equivalent excess (Figure 3A). A small reduction in the absorption intensity
at 461 nm was observed corresponding to the additive effect of the
peptides. To gain more insight, we further calculated the dissociation
constants for ATSM, DAHK, and NCtr1 to check their binding affinity
for Cu(II). The spectrophotometric data fit well to the 1:1 ligand-to-metal
binding isotherm (Figure S1) with dissociation
constants of DAHK and NCtr1 for copper binding in our experimental
conditions were found to be 5.16 ± 1.4 × 10–12 and 7.42 ± 4.2 × 10–9 M, respectively,
which are close to reported values.36,38,39 The dissociation constant for the ATSM ligand was
found to be 7.7 ± 2.02 × 10–15 M. Indeed,
the ATSM ligand has more affinity to copper than ATCUN peptides. These
data suggest that ATSM-Cu(II) remains stable in the presence of ATCUN
motifs. Further, we carried out an X-band continuous wave (CW) EPR
measurement at low temperatures (130 ± 5 K) to investigate the
interactions of DAHK and NCtr1 peptides with the ATSM-Cu(II) complex.
The ATSM-Cu(II) solution prepared in 0.1 M phosphate buffer was also
calibrated against the Cu(II) solution in water (Figure S2). The calibration showed that we succeeded in dissolving
about 80% of the ATSM-Cu(II) in an aqueous environment of 0.1 M phosphate
buffer (pH 7.4). The EPR spectra of ATSM-Cu(II) at phosphate buffer
was simulated with g ∼2.0 and A|| = 400 MHz indicating a type 1 Cu(II) spectra with a
deviation from the square panel of 2N2S coordination.40 No change in the EPR spectrum of the ATSM-Cu(II) complex
was observed when 5 equiv of DAHK or NCtr1 was added with an overnight
incubation with ATSM-Cu(II) in phosphate buffer (Figure 3B). The formation of DAHK-Cu(II)
and NCtr1-Cu(II) complexes showed a distinct EPR signature of 2N2O/3N1O
coordination (Figure S4). Thus, UV–vis
and EPR measurements confirmed that the ATSM-Cu(II) complex might
remain intact in the extracellular environment and does not bind to
proteins that are involved in the cellular copper cycle such as the
ACTUN motif and NCtr1.

Figure 3 (A) Change in the absorption of 50 μM ATSM-Cu(II)
at 461
nm with the addition of 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, and 20 equiv
of peptides, DAHK and NCtr1. The inset shows corresponding absorption
spectra of the titration of 50 μM ATSM-Cu(II) with peptide.
The UV–visible measurement was carried out in 0.1 M phosphate
buffer (pH 7.4) with 30% DMSO. The concentration of titrating peptide
used was 0.1 to 1 mM. (B) EPR measurements of ATSM-Cu(II) in the absence
and the presence of 5 equiv of DAHK and NCtr1 peptides upon overnight
incubation. EPR measurements were carried out in 0.1 M phosphate buffer
(pH 7.4). The dashed line is a simulated spectrum.

Next, we explored the effect of reductants on the
ATSM-Cu(II) stability.
Both the extracellular and intracellular environments contain a high
concentration of reductants as a crucial part of the antioxidant network.
One reductant, the intracellular ascorbate anion concentration may
vary from 0.2 to 10 mM concentration.41 GSH is a highly abundant tripeptide (0.5 mM–10 mM) known
to reduce Cu(II) and bind Cu(I) via cysteine to assist intracellular
Cu(I) transport.42−44 Additionally, the oxygen deprivation in hypoxic cells
significantly adds to the reducing environment of those cells.

Wedd et al.45 reported that the presence
of 20 equiv of ascorbate or glutathione is not enough (even in anaerobic
conditions) for the reduction of the ATSM-Cu(II) complex. Therefore,
to determine the concentration of ascorbic acid (AA) required to reduce
the ATSM-Cu(II) complex, we started with ascorbic acid and monitored
the kinetics of the reduction of ATSM-Cu(II) with changing ascorbic
acid concentrations (Figure 4A). There was no significant decrease in the absorption at
461 nm detected until 50 equiv of ascorbic acid. A small drop at 461
nm was seen with the addition of 75 equiv of ascorbic acid. The presence
of oxygen perhaps efficiently oxidizes ATSM-Cu(I) to ATSM-Cu(II) against
the slow reduction of ATSM-Cu(II). In the presence of 100 equiv (or
more) of ascorbic acid, a significant decrease in the absorption intensity
was observed, and the ATSM-Cu(II) complex was reduced entirely within
120 min (Figure 4A
and Figure S5). Salerno et al. also checked
the stability of Cu(II)-bis(thiosemicarbazone) in the reducing environment
of the cell and also refer to the Cu(II) complexes were highly stable.46

Figure 4 (A) Kinetics of the reduction of 50 μM ATSM-Cu(II)
was monitored
as a decrease in the absorption at 461 nm with increasing ascorbic
acid (AA) concentration at an interval of 5 min for 110 min. (B) The
kinetics of the reduction of 50 μM ATSM-Cu(II) was monitored
at 461 nm after the addition of 5 mM AA, GSH, and l-Cysteine
(100 equiv). All the reactions were carried out in 30% DMSO in 0.1
M phosphate buffer (pH 7.4).

We also compared the ability of ascorbic acid to reduce the
ATSM-Cu(II)
complex with the biological reductants, l-cysteine (Cys)
and GSH. We used 100 equiv of reductant in each case (Figure 4B, for full spectral traces, Figures S6 and S7). The rate of reduction of
ATSM-Cu(II) in the presence of l-cysteine is higher than
for GSH but lower than for ascorbic acid. However, the incomplete
reduction is observed in a given condition. In the case of l-cysteine, a nearly 40% reduction was found in 50 min, ATSM-Cu(I)
then reoxidized immediately to form the ATSM-Cu(II) complex. GSH slowly
reduces ATSM-Cu(II). As GSH binds Cu(I), perhaps GSH forms a GSH-Cu(I)
complex, however, the ATSM ligand may compete with Cu(I) binding,
and the competition could favor an oxidation reaction to form ATSM-Cu(II).
The reduction of Cu(II) complexes by using excess ascorbate could
be used to screen for the Cu(II) complexes detecting hypoxic cells.
Under our experimental conditions, the ability to reduce ATSM-Cu(II)
by the reductants was found to be in the order of AA > Cys >
GSH.

Further absorption measurements were carried out to confirm
the
reduction of ATSM-Cu(II) to either ATSM-Cu(I) or Cu(I). Initially,
we used BCA as a Cu(I) indicator since the (BCA)2-Cu(I)
complex has an absorption of the d–d band, and we can quantify
it at 561 nm (ε = 7700 M–1 cm–1). The absorption spectrum of ATSM-Cu(II) with 5 equiv of BCA does
not change for at least 60 min. With the addition of ascorbic acid
at 100 equiv in the above solution, one would expect a complete reduction
of Cu(II) to Cu(I) and the formation of 50 μM of the (BCA)2-Cu(I) complex. Interestingly, we observed two coexisting
species, that is, ATSM-Cu(II) and (BCA)2-Cu(I) complexes,
detected at 461 and 561 nm, respectively (Figure 5A). Similarly, the reduction of the ATSM-Cu(II)
complex with the simultaneous (BCA)2-Cu(I) formation was
studied in the presence of excess GSH. The absorption data showed
that GSH at 100 equivalents reduces the ATSM-Cu(II) complex, but the
rate is prolonged, which can be seen as a small elevation at 561 nm
showing (BCA)2-Cu(I) formation (Figures S8 and S9). The reduction of ATSM-Cu(II) was facilitated in
the presence of BCA; however, the ATSM ligand also competes with BCA
for Cu(I) binding. ATSM-Cu(II) may interact with Cu(I) sinks like
Atox1.

Figure 5 (A) 50 μM ATSM-Cu(II) and 250 μM BCA with 5 mM ascorbic
acid; (B) 50 μM ATSM-Cu(II) and 80 μM Atox1 with 5 mM
ascorbic acid. The absorption measurement was carried out at an interval
of 5 min. A concentration of 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) with
30% DMSO was used as a solvent. The inset shows the reduction of ATSM-Cu(II)
at 461 nm and the formation of the (BCA)2-Cu(I) complex
at 561 nm; an absorption at 561 nm was plotted after correction (subtracting
the value at 700 nm), and here, the absorption value at 461 nm was
plotted after correction (subtracting the value at 400 nm).

To explore this possibility, the
reduction of ATSM-Cu(II) with
ascorbate was carried out in the presence of human Atox1 protein (Figure 5B). The human Atox1
protein is reported to be a dimer consisted of two 68 amino acid monomers.47 Atox1 binds Cu(I) with high affinity (Kd = 2
× 10–14 M) through the cysteine residues of
the MXCXXC motif.29,48 Wedd et al.45 demonstrated that the nonphysiological reductant sodium
dithionite at 20 equivalents immediately reduced ATSM-Cu(II) to ATSM-Cu(I),
and then Cu(I) bound the proteins Atox1 and a cytosolic C-terminal
domain of Ctr1 (Ctr1c, metallothionein-like) derived from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, but the
reaction was prolonged. However, no reduction of ATSM-Cu(II) was observed
in the presence of biological reducing agents, ascorbic acid (AA)
and glutathione (GSH) at 20 equivalents.

We investigated, under
our experimental conditions, whether the
intracellular copper protein Atox1 retrieves Cu(I) from ATSM coordination
and whether Atox1 affects the integration mechanism of ATSM-Cu(II).
Interestingly, in the presence of Atox1, even the reduction of the
ATSM-Cu(II) complex was inhibited (Figure 5B). We did not see the formation of the (BCA)2-Cu(I) complex from the ATSM-Cu(II) complex when the reaction
was carried out in the presence of Atox1. This is perhaps due to interactions
of Atox1 over BCA with Cu(I) (Figure 6A and Figure S10). Similar
results were obtained in the case of GSH as a Cu(I) chelator in the
presence of excess ascorbic acid (Figure S10, ESI). However, a low amount of (BCA)2-Cu(I) was identified,
which confirms that GSH has lower affinity to bind Cu(I) than Atox1.

Figure 6 (A) UV–visible
spectra show the effect of Atox1 protein
on the formation of the (BCA)2-Cu(I) complex. The samples
were prepared in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). (B) EPR spectra
of copper in the absence and the presence of Atox1. The samples were
prepared in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). The samples were mixed
well and incubated at 4 °C for 1 h before spectral measurements.
(C) EPR spectrum of the ATSM-Cu(II) complex in the absence and presence
of Atox1.

We also carried out EPR measurements
to check whether Atox1 interacted
with ATSM-Cu(II), an interaction which might interfere with the reaction
with ascorbic acid. Initially, we checked whether Cu(II) can coordinate
with Atox1. The EPR spectra of free Cu(II) in the buffer and in the
presence of Atox1 were identical (Figure 6B), suggesting that Cu(II) cannot coordinate
with Atox1. Indeed, the simulations showed 4O coordination of Cu(II)
(g|| = 2.38, A|| = 420 MHz) confirming that Cu(II) was dissolved in water and not
coordinated with Atox1. EPR spectra of ATSM-Cu(II) in the presence
of Atox1 (Figure 6C)
showed no change, therefore also suggesting that ATSM-Cu(II) does
not interact with Atox1 protein.

Conclusions
Herein,
we explored the binding of ATSM-Cu(II) to copper cellular
proteins and their stability under reducing environments using spectrophotometric
and EPR measurements. We showed that ATSM-Cu(II) remains intact against
the extracellular high-affinity Cu(II) binding motifs, DAHK and NCtr1.
This study proposes that ATSM-Cu(II) does not bind to proteins that
are involved in the copper cycle. It is important to note that these
experiments were performed in vitro, and in the cell other cellular
pathways may assist in shuttling ATSM-Cu(II). Cell experiments should
be performed to verify weather ATSM-Cu(II) is only passively taken
by the cell, or there are other pathways behind the cellular copper
carriers that may assist in actively transfer it to the cell.

Then, we checked the stability of ATSM-Cu(II) in a reducing environment.
We showed that only high concentration of reductant in the order of
the 100-fold excess of the physiological reductants ascorbate, l-Cys, and GSH can reduce the ATSM-Cu(II) complex incompletely,
in the order of AA > l-Cys > GSH (when the reaction
is open
to air). This indicates that ATSM-Cu(II) is highly stable, and therefore,
it will be able to be reduced only in severe hypoxic conditions. Moreover,
probably its reducing time will take several hours, which limits its
applications as a biomarker for hypoxia.

Interestingly, we found
out that the presence of Cu(I) cellular
protein, such as Atox1, significantly decreases the rate of ATSM-Cu(II)
reduction. Altogether, the results presented here propose the poor
efficiency of ATSM-Cu(II) as a biomarker for hypoxia. Since this complex
cannot bind to proteins that are involved in the copper cycle, its
reduction efficiency is low, and proteins in the cell can decrease
the reduction rate even more.
