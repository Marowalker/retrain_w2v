Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) stabilized
by imidazolium salts derived
from amino acids [glycine (1), rac-alanine
(2), l-phenylalanine (3), and rac-methionine (4)] were prepared. The AuNPs
were stabilized the most by 4, which kept the particles
dispersed in water for months at pH > 5.5. These AuNPs exhibited
a
well-defined absorption band at 517 nm and had an average particle
size of 11.21 ± 0.07 nm. The 4-AuNPs were reversibly aggregated
by controlling the pH of the solution. Chiral R,R-4-AuNPs and S,S-4-AuNPs
were synthesized, and the chiral environment on the nanoparticle surface
was confirmed using circular dichroism; these nanoparticles exhibited
a molecular recognition of chiral substrates. Furthermore, they showed
potential for separating racemic mixtures when supported on a layered
double hydroxide.

Introduction
Gold nanoparticles
(AuNPs) have been studied extensively by the
scientific community because of their unique electronic, chemical,1 and optical properties,2,3 which
originate from localized surface plasmon bands.4 Special emphasis has been placed on synthesizing stable
water-soluble metallic nanoparticles (MNPs)5−7 to expand their
potential applications, especially in the fields of biology,8,9 medicine,10,11 and green chemistry.12−14 Molecular coatings on metal nanoparticles play an important role
in providing the desired water solubility and chemical functionality
and in enabling the nanoparticles to assemble, which is essential
in all of the above-mentioned applications.1

Furthermore, over the past decade, considerable efforts have
been
devoted to the synthesis and characterization of optically active
MNPs15 capped with chiral organic compounds.16 Their preparation usually requires the use of
protective agents such as surfactants,17 polymers,18 and ligands.7 Recently, DNA,19l/d-tartaric acid,20l/d-penicillamine,21l/d-amino acids,22,23R/S-BINAP,24 and R/S-BINAS,25 among others, have
been used to prepare chiral AuNPs, where circular dichroism (CD) spectrum
is the most important tool to evaluate the chiral environment.26

Chiral MNPs have the potential for application
in heterogeneous
enantioselective catalysis,7,24 chiral recognition,23 enantioseparation,16 and nonlinear optics.22 In particular,
Guonan Chen and co-workers recently demonstrated the potential of
chiral MNPs for molecular recognition and resolution of enantiomers
in racemic mixtures by using a system based on AuNPs modified with
functional nucleic acids to perform the enantiospecific separation
of rac-tryptophan.27 Gellman
et al. studied the absorption of rac-propylene oxide
on l/d-cysteine-modified AuNPs and measured the
enantioselective response using optical rotation.16 Recently, Baoxin Li and co-workers explored the potential
of l-tartaric acid-capped AuNPs for chiral recognition of l-mandelic acid by hydrogen bond interactions. This system is
cheap and efficient because it enabled visual chiral recognition by
a change in the solution color.20

On the other hand, we reported the synthesis of imidazolium zwitterions
derived from amino acids and used them to prepare N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) gold(I) and (III) complexes.28 These complexes exhibited a strong tendency
to form AuNPs in solution. Here, we report the successful synthesis
and characterization of chiral AuNPs stabilized by these imidazolium
salts in aqueous media. These nanoparticles are reversibly aggregated
in response to changes in the pH of the solution. Furthermore, the
potential of these AuNPs for the molecular recognition of enantiomers
and for resolving the racemic mixtures when supported on a layered
double hydroxide (LDH) was investigated.

Results and Discussion
The imidazolium zwitterions derived from the amino acids glycine
(1), rac-alanine (2), l-phenylalanine (3), and rac-methionine
(4) were prepared following the methodology previously
reported28 (Figure 1). Additionally, S,S-4 and R,R-4 enantiomers
were synthesized from S- and R-methionine,
respectively.

Figure 1 Imidazolium zwitterions 1–4.

To prepare the AuNPs, NaBH4 was added to HAuCl4 solution, and an imidazolium
zwitterion (1, 2, 3, or 4) was subsequently added to the
mixture. For 1–3, the order of addition
of the ligand and NaBH4 did not affect the results; however,
for 4, if the ligand was added before NaBH4, a yellow precipitate was formed immediately. To ascertain the reason
for these different results, HAuCl4 and the imidazolium
zwitterions (1–4) were reacted in
a 1:1 ratio. Thus, when compound 1, 2, or 3 was used, the corresponding [imidazolium][AuCl4–] adduct was formed. The adduct with 2 (2-H+·AuCl4–) was fully
characterized using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) (see Figure S1), elemental analysis, and single-crystal
X-ray diffraction (XRD) studies (Figure 2); the diffracted crystal contained a mixture
of diastereomers R,S-2-H+·AuCl4– and S,S-2-H+·AuCl4– in a 64:36 ratio because of the use of d,l-alanine
as a starting material for the synthesis of 2. This adduct
2-H+·AuCl4– crystallized
in the monoclinic P21 space group. In
the molecular structure, the two amino acid residues were located
on different sides of the imidazolium planar ring. In the crystal
structure, both carboxylic acid groups participated in the hydrogen
bond interactions (Figure S2), forming
rows running along the c axis with O...O distances
of 2.634(14) and 2.747(11) Å for R,S-2-H+·AuCl4– and distances
of 2.65(3) and 2.588(18) Å for the minor component. On the basis
of these distances, the hydrogen bond could be categorized as strong
(2.50–2.65 Å).29 By contrast,
the reaction with 4 resulted in the immediate formation
of a yellow precipitate (4-H+·AuCl4–) that was isolated and dried under a negative pressure.
This solid was unstable, and eventually, metallic gold was deposited
on the vessel walls. The solid obtained with the S,S-4 enantiomer (S,S-4-H+·AuCl4–) and the S,S-4 ligand were characterized using carbon
nuclear magnetic resonance (13C NMR), cross-polarization/magic-angle
spinning (CP/MAS), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and elemental
analysis. The 13C NMR CP/MAS spectrum of S,S-4 displayed doublet signals because of the lack
of symmetry of the two methionine sides of the ligand (Figure 3a); this can be explained on
the basis of solid-state 13C NMR analysis because by this
spectroscopic technique, it is possible to detect two different molecular
environments over the methionine carbons on both sides of the ligand
molecule.

corresponding proposed structures with the molecular formula C26H40Au4Cl10N4O8S4 based on the elemental analysis and the TGA
results.

Thus, the molecular asymmetry
is the consequence of a fixed and
stable zwitterion on one methionine side chain of the molecule in
comparison with the other uncharged side, as shown in Figure 3a, whereas broad bands were
observed in the S,S-4-H+ AuCl4– spectrum (Figure 3b) because of the increased anisotropy caused
by the AuCl4– association. For both of
the compounds (Figure 3a,b), the chemical shift patterns were similar, except for those
of the −CH2–CH2–S–CH3 fragment. For S,S-4, the 13C chemical shifts of −CH2–CH2–S–CH3 were 32.3, 30.5, and 13.74
ppm, whereas for S,S-4-H+·AuCl4–, the CH2–CH2–S signals were shifted to a single signal at 36.79
ppm and the S–CH3 signal appeared at 24.09 ppm (Figure 3b). The downfield
chemical shift of the S,S-4-H+·AuCl4– signals was due
to the coordination of the sulfur atoms to a gold atom, which is consistent
with previous observations for a gold complex with a sulfur ligand.30

According to the studies using TGA, S,S-4 decomposed at 286.94 °C (Figure S3). The S,S-4-H+·AuCl4– TGA results showed a weight
loss of 15.08% at 167.37 °C and a second weight loss of 21.04%
at 278.05 °C (Figure S4). On the basis
of the similarity between the S,S-4 decomposition temperature and the second S,S-4-H+·AuCl4– temperature, the total amount of organic material in S,S-4-H+·AuCl4– was determined to be 36.12%. This result and the results of elemental
analysis (C, 17.25; H, 2.29; N, 3.51%) were used to propose the structure
shown in Figure 3b,
which includes Au–Au interactions that are typically observed
in gold complexes.31,32 The structural differences between
2-H+·AuCl4– and S,S-4-H+·AuCl4– demonstrate the effect of the order of addition
of the reagent on the 4-AuNP synthesis.

The AuNPs were stabilized
by 1–3 in solution for a couple of
days and exhibited an absorption band
at 523 nm (Figure S5). Nevertheless, the
AuNPs stabilization was enhanced by 4, which kept them
dispersed in solution for months at pH > 5.5, and exhibited a well-defined
absorption band at 517 nm. Furthermore, no gold was deposited on the
vial walls and no precipitate formation indicating destabilization
was observed. The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images revealed
that the 4-AuNPs were spherical with an average particle size of 11.21
± 0.07 nm (Figure 5).

The 4-AuNPs are sensible to pH changes by precipitating
from solution
as a blue solid at pH < 3 and redispersing to form a ruby red solution
at pH > 5.5. This reversible process could be performed at least
15
times without changing the particle morphology or size, as shown by
the TEM and ultraviolet–visible (UV–vis) spectroscopy
results. A single sharp band was observed at 517 nm at pH > 5.5,
and
an extra band appeared at approximately 650 nm when the nanoparticles
began to aggregate when the pH value approached 3 (Figure 4). This AuNP redispersion process
was previously reported for the AuNPs stabilized by carboxymethyl
cellulose,33 carboxylate-modified polyvinylpyrrolidone,12 thiols,34 or NHC35 among other stabilizants. The aggregation behavior
of the AuNPs synthesized with 1–3 could not be reversibly controlled by changing the pH.

Figure 4 UV–vis
spectra demonstrating the reversible aggregation
of the 4-AuNPs controlled by changing the pH from 8.0 to 3.0. The
new peak at 650 nm indicates nanoparticle aggregation.

The characterization of the S,S-4-H+·AuCl4– complex
showed that 4 preferred to coordinate with the gold atoms
through the sulfur atoms. Therefore, it was assumed that the sulfur
atoms were bonded to the AuNP surface, leaving carboxylate groups
exposed on the 4-AuNP surface. These carboxylate groups were susceptible
to protonation/deprotonation when the pH was modified, enabling the
formation and breaking of the hydrogen bonds between ligands in a
reversible process. For pH < 5.5, aggregation is observed because
hydrogen bonds are formed between the carboxylic acid moieties in
both methionine side chains of the ligand. These functional groups
can promote the formation of dimeric hydrogen bonds between the ligands
from some other nanoparticles. Moreover, when the nanoparticles were
treated under alkaline pH, redispersion of the 4-AuNPs occurred because
of the formation of carboxylates in the ligands, allowing electrostatic
stabilization. By contrast, for the (1–3)-AuNPs, the electrostatic interaction between the carboxylate groups
of the ligands and the gold surface is disrupted in an acidic media
because of the protonation of the carboxylic groups, and consequently,
the (1–3)-AuNPs aggregated irreversibly.

To gain a greater insight into this controlled aggregation behavior,
high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) analysis
of the S,S-4-AuNPs was performed
at pH 3.0, 5.0, and 8.0. At pH 8.0 and 5.0, the S,S-4-AuNPs formed aggregates with nanoparticles
stacked on top of each other due to sample concentration and sample
dehydration. Interestingly, at pH 3.0 (Figure 5), the spherical
nanoparticles were arranged with an average distance of 1.43 nm between
them. On the basis of the crystallographic data previously reported
for 4,28 this distance is
close to the distance between two 4 ligands interacting
via hydrogen bonds through their carboxylic acid groups (the distance
between the sulfur atom and the carboxyl oxygen atom in 4 is 0.63 nm).28

and their corresponding fast Fourier transform
(FFT) (c) of the S,S-4-AuNPs at
pH = 3.0. The yellow lines in d, e, and f show the distance between
two nanosphere surfaces, which most likely corresponds to the distance
between the two ligands interacting via hydrogen bonds.

The 4-AuNP precipitation/redispersion process allowed
nanoparticles
purification after their synthesis. Hence, after precipitating the
4-AuNP in an acidic medium, the solution was decanted and analyzed
using atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS). We found that this solution
contained just 2% of the total Au present in the initial solution
indicating that the AuNP yield was 98%. Additionally, the solution
was evaporated, and the resultant slightly yellow hygroscopic solid
(4′) was analyzed using 13C and 1H NMR (Figure S6). The 13C NMR chemical shifts (Table S1) were
similar to those of 4 (e.g., 30.12, 29.11, and 14.03
ppm for CH2–CH2–S–CH3) because of an excess of 4 that remained after
the synthesis. Three additional signals were observed at 24.93, 43.22,
and 36.95 ppm and were similar to those reported by Deslandes et al.36 for the CH2–CH2–S(O)–CH3 fragment of sulfoxide N-methyl-l-methionine (25.6, 50.6, and 39.2 ppm),
which indicates the presence of oxidized 4 and suggests
that the ligand participates directly in the formation of AuNPs. Additionally,
a wet precipitated 4-AuNP sample was analyzed using TGA (Figure S7); a weight loss of 1.95% (water loss)
and another weight loss of 3.67% at 289.43 °C (a similar decomposition
of 4) were determined. This result allows us to determine
the millimolar ratio of the ligand-Au in the 4-AuNPs, which is 1:4.

S,S-4 and R,R-4 were used to synthesize AuNPs according to the methodology
described previously, and the chiral environment conferred on the R,R-4-AuNP and S,S-4-AuNP metal surfaces by these ligands was analyzed using
CD (Figure 6a). The
maximum and minimum absorption bands were observed at approximately
210 nm, which is consistent with the CD curves of the R,R-4 and S,S-4
ligands (Figure 6b).
This result confirmed the chiral nature of the nanoparticle surfaces;
therefore, the ability of these nanoparticles to achieve a molecular
recognition of chiral substrates was studied.

and S,S-4-AuNPs and (b) R,R-4 and S,S-4.

The interactions of R,R-4-AuNPs
and S,S-4-AuNPs with R and S enantiomer substrates were also analyzed
using CD. The following substrates were selected based on their ability
to form hydrogen bonds with the ligand through carboxylic groups on
the AuNP surface: alanine, phenylalanine, proline, N-acetyl alanine, N-acetyl phenylalanine, prolinol,
2-aminobutanol, sec-butylamine, methylbenzylamine,
and 2-butanol. First, the CD spectra of the R and S substrates were obtained. Then, the CD spectra of the
[R,R-4-AuNPs + R-substrate], [R,R-4-AuNPs + S-substrate], [S,S-4-AuNPs + R-substrate], and [S,S-4-AuNPs + S-sustrate] mixtures were acquired for each substrate.
Finally, the differences between the absorption spectra of the pure
enantiomers and the mixtures were analyzed. For example, in the case
of prolinol, the CD ellipticity absolute values of the [R,R-4-AuNPs + R-prolinol] and [S,S-4-AuNPs + S-prolinol] mixtures increased relatively to those
for R- and S-prolinol, respectively
(Figure 7a, left).
The CD ellipticity absolute values of the other two mixtures also
increased relatively to those of the substrate, but the increase was
smaller. Figure 7a
(right) shows the difference between the spectra of the mixtures with
the strongest interactions and the corresponding pure enantiomers,
that is, the net interaction. The symmetry observed in these differences
suggests that the AuNP–substrate interactions were the same
in magnitude. Similar results were observed for the alanine enantiomers;
the absolute intensities of the [R,R-4-AuNPs + R-alanine] and [S,S-4-AuNPs + S-alanine] CD spectra were higher than those of pure alanine and the other
two mixtures (Figure 7b). Unlike the above substrates, for 2-aminobutanol, the CD absolute
intensities of the [R,R-4-AuNPs
+ S-2-aminobutanol] and
[S,S-4-AuNPs + R-2-aminobutanol] mixtures were lower than
those of R- and S-2-aminobutanol,
respectively (Figure 7c). Further, the maximum and minimum intensity bands of the aminobutanol
mixtures underwent a red shift of 8.0 nm relative to those of the
pure enantiomers (198 nm). This behavior was also observed for the
other two mixtures; nonetheless, the difference in wavelength between
the mixtures and the pure enantiomers was smaller. For the other substrates,
the CD absorption spectra of the mixtures and the pure enantiomers
were the same, suggesting that these substrates did not interact with
the AuNP molecular coating. Interestingly, the three substrates that
interacted with the coated nanoparticles have two functional groups
that are capable of forming hydrogen bonds; they also display low
steric hindrance and flexible structures; therefore, they could readily
form hydrogen bonds with the AuNP carboxylic ligands.

and S,S-4-AuNP mixtures with the
(a) prolinol, (b) alanine, and (c) 2-aminobutanol enantiomers. The
plots on the left show the spectra of the [R,R-4-AuNPs + R-substrate], [R,R-4-AuNPs + S-substrate], [S,S-4-AuNPs + R-substrate], and [S,S-4-AuNPs + S-substrate] mixtures and the pure enantiomers. The plots on the right show
the difference between the spectra of the mixtures with the best interactions
and the corresponding pure enantiomers.

Because of the affinity between the 4-AuNPs and prolinol,
alanine,
and 2-aminobutanol, the ability of these nanoparticles to discriminate
between the enantiomers in a racemic mixture was studied. Accordingly,
aliquots of racemic substrate mixtures were added to R,R-4-AuNP and S,S-4-AuNP solutions, and the resultant mixtures were analyzed using
CD. For example, 10 μL aliquots of rac-2-aminobutanol
solution (211 mM) were added to a vial containing 0.5 mL of S,S-4-AuNP solution (1.12 mM, based on
gold atoms). The mixture was stirred for 1 minute after each addition,
and then analyzed using CD. The results of the titration are shown
in Figure 8. Then,
60 μL (1.3 × 10–2 mmol) of the rac-2-aminobutanol solution was added to the nanoparticle
solution, a minimum band appeared (190–195 nm), indicating
that the S,S-4-AuNPs and R-2-aminobutanol started to interact, and the solution became
enriched with S-2-aminobutanol. The titration was
stopped after adding 110 μL (2.1 × 10–2 mmol) because the absorption spectra did not change because of the
saturation of the chiral centers on the nanoparticle surface. On the
basis of these results, it was determined that the maximum interaction
between the S,S-4-AuNPs and R-2-aminobutanol detected using CD spectroscopy occurred
at a nanoparticle/substrate molar ratio of 42:1.

Figure 8 CD spectra of the mixtures
of 0.5 mL of the S,S-4-AuNPs (1.12
mM) and 10–110 μL of rac-2-aminobutanol
solution (1.1–2.1 × 10–2 mmol).

To study the potential of these
nanoparticles to resolve the racemic
mixtures, they were supported on an inorganic matrix. Aires et al.37 reported the synthesis and stability of AuNPs
supported on LDHs, and Ballarin et al.38 reported a high affinity between an LDH and AuNPs. Hence, an LDH
[Zn5Al2(OH)14CO3] was
synthesized according to the coprecipitation methodology of Carbajal-Arízaga
and Jiménez39 and characterized
using XRD and attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared
(ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy. Then, the LDH was added to the AuNP solution,
resulting in the loss of color in the solution and change in the LDH
color from white to pink. This process was repeated until the solid
was completely saturated, yielding a fine purple powder after drying
(LDH-4-AuNPs). AAS experiments showed that 1.0 mg of gold was supported
on 20 mg of dry LDH. XRD data indicated that the LDH structure presented
a basal distance (related to separation of layers) equal to 7.45 Å
before and after the impregnation with the AuNP solution (Figure S8); thus no intercalation of AuNP or
the ligand occurred. The analysis using TEM (Figure 9) revealed a nonhomogeneous AuNP distribution
on the LDH surface.

(STEM)
images (c) for the LDH-S,S-4-AuNPs.
This reveals a nonhomogeneous AuNPs distribution on the LDH surface.

On the other hand, a simple method
was not found to determine the
enantiomeric excess (ee) through CD. Therefore, the ee was obtained
from the calibration curves of the pure alanine and 2-aminobutanol
enantiomers. Hence for alanine, 1.4–4.3 mg/mL aqueous solutions
of each enantiomer were prepared. The maximum and minimum CD ellipticity
values were observed at 204 nm for R- and S-alanine (Figure S9a). The sample
concentrations were linearly correlated with the ellipticity values
by eqs 1 and 2 for S- and R-alanine,
respectively. Similarly, calibration curves were obtained for the
2-aminobutanol enantiomers over the concentration range of 0.5–2
μL/mL. The maximum and minimum CD ellipticity values were observed
at 193 nm for R- and S-2-aminobutanol
(Figure S9b), and the R and S enantiomer concentrations were linearly correlated
with the ellipticity values by eqs 3 and 4, respectively. The calibration
curves were validated using mixtures of known concentrations, confirming
their usefulness (Tables S2 and S3). 1   2   3   4  

To resolve the racemic mixtures, two
procedures were explored.
In the first method (P-1), 100 mg of the chiral LDH-4-AuNPs
was packed in a Pasteur pipette. Water was used as an eluant to achieve
uniform packing. Then, 0.4 mL of 0.50 M racemic solution was flowed
through the column, and 0.5 mL aliquots (rac-alanine
and rac-2-aminobutanol in water and rac-prolinol in methanol) were collected. The collected fractions were
dried, and 1 mg for alanine or 1 μL for 2-aminobutanol and prolinol
was subsequently transferred into a 1 mL volumetric flask and diluted
to the given volume with water. In the second method (P-2), 150 mg of the chiral LDH-4-AuNPs and 10 mg of rac-alanine or 10 μL of the other substrates were stirred in 1
mL of water for 1 h, and the sample was decanted. The decanted liquid
was evaporated, and 2.0 mg for alanine or 1.0 μL for 2-aminobutanol
and prolinol was dissolved in 1 mL of water for CD analysis. This
procedure was repeated five times.

After performing P-1 and P-2 experiments
with rac-prolinol, the solutions darkened (because
of a possible oxidation); therefore, this substrate was not studied
further. For rac-alanine, fractions enriched in one
of the enantiomers were not obtained after P-1; however,
good results were observed after P-2. Figure 10a shows the results for the
LDH-S,S-4-AuNPs. The spectra of
the initial fraction showed an ellipticity value of approximately
−7.5 mdeg, which corresponds to 17.0% ee of R-alanine, based on eq 1. This result agrees with the previous experiments where an affinity
between the S,S-4-AuNPs and S-alanine was observed. This interaction led to the production
of the enriched R-alanine fraction. By contrast,
when the LDH-R,R-4-AuNPs were used,
fractions enriched in S-alanine were observed, displaying
an ee of 10%, based on eq 2 (Figure 10b). These
ee values were corroborated by using a quiral high-performance liquid
chromatography (HPLC) technique according to the recommended procedure
for using a Chiralcel OD-H column,40 and
they were consistent with the CD quantitative results (Figure S10, Table S4). For the resolution of rac-2-aminobutanol, the P-1 process led to better results than the P-2 method. Figure 10c shows the results obtained using a column packed with the LDH-R,R-4-AuNPs. The second and third fractions
were enriched in R-2-aminobutanol and had an ee of
12.0%, based on eq 3.
This result is consistent with the earlier experiments in which an
affinity between the R,R-4-AuNPs
and S-2-aminobutanol was observed. This interaction
enabled the elution of samples enriched in R-2-aminobutanol.

Experimental Section
General Information
All chemicals were obtained from
Sigma Aldrich and used without further purification. NaBH4 and HAuCl4·3H2O were kept under an N2 atmosphere to prevent hydration. All glassware and magnetic
stirrer bars used to synthesize the AuNPs were washed with aqua regia
(HCl/HNO3 = 3:1) to avoid unwanted nucleation during the
synthesis.

The morphology and size of the AuNPs were characterized
by HRTEM using a FEI TECNAI F30 STWIN G2 instrument operated at 300
kV. UV–vis absorption spectra were recorded at room temperature
using a Thermo Scientific Genesys 10S spectrometer. CD spectra were
recorded on a Jasco J-1500 spectrometer using a 1 mm rectangular quartz
cuvette. A Waters 600 pump equipped with a Rheodyme 7725i injector
and a Waters 2996 photodiode array detector was used to perform chromatographic
experiments with a Chiralcel OD-H column (250 mm L × 4.6 mm I.D.). 1H and 13C NMR spectra were obtained on a JEOL ECA
600 spectrometer of 14 T magnet field (600 MHz).

AAS experiments
were performed using a Varian SpectrAA 220 spectrometer.
For the gold analysis, a 4 mA hollow-cathode lamp with a wavelength
of 267.6 nm was used. The TGA was performed using a Discovery TGA
equipment from TA Instruments with a temperature gradient of 10 °C/min
under a nitrogen flow.

Powder XRD patterns were obtained on
a Siemens D500 system. The
samples were scanned using Cu Kα source over the 2θ range
from 5 to 60° at a rate of 0.02°/s using a current of 20
mA and a voltage of 30 kV.

Single crystal X-ray diffraction
data of 2-H+·AuCl4− were
collected at room temperature on
an Oxford Diffraction Gemini CCD diffractometer with graphite-monochromated
Mo Kα radiation (λ = 0.71073 Å). The data were integrated,
scaled, sorted, and averaged using CrysAlis software package. By using
Olex2,41 the structures were solved with
the ShelXS structure solution program using Direct Methods and refined
with the ShelXL42 refinement package using
Least Squares minimization. All nonhydrogen atoms were refined anisotropically.
The positions of the hydrogen atoms were kept fixed with a common
isotropic displacement parameter; the hydrogen atoms linked to the
oxygen atoms were located on the Fourier map. A summary of the crystal
data and the refinement parameters for the structural analyses is
given in Table S5. The R,S and S,S diastereomers
were observed in the cell in a 64:36 ratio. The [AuCl4]− anion displayed positional disorder over two positions,
with the main component having an occupancy of 0.641(9). The disorder
was treated with rigid bond restraints by using instructions such
as SAME, SIMU, and DELU (For a detailed description of the restraints,
see Müller, Peter. “Disorder” Crystal Structure
Refinement. A Crystallographer’s Guide to SHELXL. Edited by
P. Müller. New York: Oxford University Press, 2006, 56−96).

General Procedure for the Synthesis of 1–4
Ligands 1–4 were
prepared according to our previously reported procedures.28l- and d-methionine were used
to prepare S,S-4 and R,R-4, respectively. For these enantiomers, the optical
values were −18.00 ± 0.06 for R,R-4 and +18.00 ± 0.06 for S,S-4, which were obtained from a solution containing 3 g/100
mL of R,R-4 or S,S-4 in NaOH (0.1 M) at 25 °C.

General Procedure
for the Synthesis of AuNPs Stabilized by 1–4
A solution of 1.0 mL of HAuCl4·3H2O (6.9 mM) was added to 20 mL of water
under stirring at 1000 rpm. The mixture was heated to 40 °C,
and 0.8 mL of NaBH4 solution (26.4 mM in water) was added.
Then, 0.8 mL of an appropriate solution of 1–4 (4.0 mM) was immediately added to the mixture. The solution
was stirred for 20 min at 40 °C and then cooled to room temperature.

The purification of 4-AuNPs, S,S-4-AuNPs, and R,R-4-AuNPs was carried
out by adding 1.0 mL of HCl (0.1 M) to the solution, which changed
the color from red to deep blue. The sample was centrifuged at 2500
rpm for 2 min. The solution was decanted, and the blue solid was redispersed
by adding 5 mL of water and 50 μL of 0.1 M NaOH. The resultant
solution developed an intense red color.

Synthesis of 2-H+·AuCl4–
Twenty milligrams
of HAuCl4·3H2O (5.1 × 10–2 mmol) and 10.8 mg of 2 (5.1 × 10–2 mmol) were added to 2.0 mL of
water in a vial. The yellow solution was concentrated by evaporation
at room temperature to obtain crystals. Yield: ≥99%. MP: 191.0

Synthesis of S,S-4-H+·AuCl4–
Twenty milligrams
of HAuCl4·3H2O (5.1 × 10–2 mmol) was added to 2.0 mL of water in a vial. Then, 17.0 mg of S,S-4 (5.1 × 10–2 mmol) dissolved in 5.0 mL of water was subsequently added to the
mixture. Immediately, a yellow precipitate was formed. The mixture
was filtered and dried under vacuum. Decomposition temperature: 153

Synthesis
of the Zn/Al Carbonate LDH
Al(NO3)3·9H2O (10.1 g, 26.92 mmol) and Zn(NO3)2·6H2O (20.0 g, 67.31 mmol) were
dissolved in 500 mL of distilled water (molar ratio of Al/Zn = 2.5)
and then precipitated by adding NH4OH (14.0%) to reach
a final pH of 8.0–9.0. Then, 1.42 g of Na2CO3 (13.46 mmol) was added, resulting in a pH of approximately
10. The reaction mixture was stirred for 24 h (aging time). Subsequently,
the reaction was allowed to stand for 2 h. The solution was then decanted,
and the solid was washed three times with water to get a neutral pH.

The obtained precipitate was transferred to a porcelain dish and
dried in an oven at 70 °C for 12 h. The white solid was triturated
in an agate mortar. The nominal molecular formula was calculated to
be Zn5Al2(OH)14CO3 (yield
= 92%). ATR-FTIR (cm–1): 3407.3 (s) OH, 1358.5 (s)
CO3=.

CD Analysis for Molecular Recognition Studies
To prepare
the mixtures of the S,S-4-AuNPs
or R,R-4-AuNPs and the S or R substrate (alanine, prolinol, and 2-aminobutanol),
the following general procedure was followed: 0.3 mL of R,R-4-AuNP solution (1.12 mM, based on gold atoms)
and 0.2 mL of the R substrate (500 mM) were placed
in a vial. The mixture was diluted to 3 mL with distilled water. The
same quantities of R,R-4-AuNPs, S substrate, and water were added to another vial. This
procedure was repeated for the S,S-4-AuNPs and R and S substrates.
The pH of all of the solutions was maintained between 7.8 and 8.1
to prevent aggregation of the AuNPs. The mixtures were stirred for
15 min. For the CD analysis, 0.2 mL of each chiral substrate was diluted
to 3 mL with distilled water.

AuNPs Supported on the
LDH
Six milliliters of R,R-4-AuNP or S,S-4-AuNP solution
(1.12 mM, based on gold atoms) was added
to a flask containing 1.0 g of LDH (1.8 mmol). The solution subsequently
lost its red color. The mixture was centrifuged (2000 rpm for 2 min),
and the liquid was decanted. The obtained solid was added to a fresh
AuNP solution, and the procedure was repeated until the solution remained
red, indicating that the LDH was saturated. The final solid was dried
under vacuum for 12 h to give a fine purple powder. The atomic absorption
results indicated that 20 mg of dry LDH absorbed 1.0 mg of gold (5.1 ×
10–3 mmol). ATR-FTIR (cm–1): 3379.2
(s) OH, 1352.0 (s) CO3=.

Enantioselective
Separation of rac-2-Aminobutanol
(P-1 Procedure)
A small piece of sterile
cotton and 100 mg of LDH-R,R-4-AuNPs
or LDH-S,S-4-AuNPs were packed in
a Pasteur pipette. Using 1 mL of water as eluant, 100 μL of rac-2-aminobutanol was passed through the column. Fractions
of 0.5 mL were collected and dried. Aliquots of 1.0 μL were
removed from the resulting residue and diluted to a final volume of
1 mL for CD analysis.

Enantioselective Separation of rac-Alanine
(P-2 Procedure)
One milliliter of distilled
water, 100 mg of LDH-R,R-4-AuNPs
or LDH-S,S-4-AuNPs, and 10 mg of rac-alanine were added to a vial. This reaction mixture
was stirred for 1 h, and then, the solid was allowed to settle. The
supernatant solution (200 μL) was taken and dried. This fraction
contained 2.0 mg of alanine, which was diluted up to 1 mL with distilled
water and analyzed using CD. Additionally, the settled solid was washed
five times with 1 mL of water and these fractions were also analyzed
using CD; the alanine residue was recovered in these fractions, showing
no ee.

Calibration Curves of the Alanine and 2-Aminobutanol Enantiomers
For each of the pure enantiomers (alanine and 2-aminobutanol),
a 0.5 M solution was prepared. For alanine, five aliquots in the range
of 11.2–67.2 μL were taken and diluted to 1 mL (final
concentration of 1.4–4.3 mg/mL, respectively). For 2-aminobutanol,
five aliquots in the range of 25–150 μL were taken and
diluted up to 1 mL (final concentration of 0.5–2 mg/mL, respectively).
All samples were analyzed using CD. The maximum and minimum absorption
ellipticity values were linearly correlated with the sample concentrations
by eqs 1–4. The validity of the equations was confirmed by
analyzing several enantiomer mixtures with known concentrations (Tables S2 and S3).

Chiral HPLC Analysis
The protection of the alanine
samples with carbobenzoxy (Cbz) was necessary and was made according
to the methodology reported by A. Pesic et al.43 (who reported a yield of 98%) and corroborated by 1H-NMR before the HPLC injection. The analysis was carried
out following the procedure for Chiralcel OD-H column specifications
for N-Cbz-alanine.40 The
integrity of the stereocenter for the chiral N-Cbz-amino
acid was maintained as determined using HPLC.

Conclusions
In conclusion, we obtained AuNPs stabilized by imidazolium salts
in an aqueous medium. The 4-AuNPs showed prolonged stability in water
and reversible aggregation as the pH was modified, ensuring a simple
and effective purification. Additionally, the synthesis of AuNPs with R,R-4 or S,S-4 gave a chiral environment to the metal surface with two stereogenic
centers in each ligand, which could be used to carry out the enantioselective
recognition of the substrates that could form two hydrogen bonds with
the carboxylate of the ligand on the surface metal. The chiral environment
at the nanoparticle surface was used to get a low enrichment of racemic
mixtures of alanine and 2-aminobutanol when the AuNPs were supported
on the synthesized LDH according to the CD responses. These results
open the possibility of using chiral AuNP systems in the enantiomeric
separation.
