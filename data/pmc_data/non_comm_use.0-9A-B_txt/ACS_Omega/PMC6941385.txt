With the objective of studying the conformational and
macrocyclic effects of selected metal chelates on their peroxidase
activities, Cu2+ and Fe3+ complexes were synthesized
with a macrocyclic derivative of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid and o-phenylenediamine (abbreviated as edtaodH2)
and its new open-chain analogue (edtabzH2). The Fe3+ complex of edtaodH2 has a peroxidase-like activity,
whereas the complex of edtabzH2 does not. The X-ray study
of the former shows the formation of a dimeric molecule {[Fe(edtaod)]2O} in which each metal with an octahedral coordination is
overposed over the macrocyclic cavity, as a result of rigid macrocyclic
frame, to form an Fe–O–Fe bridge; the exposure of the
central metal to the environment facilitates the capture of oxygen
to drive the biomimetic activity. The peroxidase-inactive Fe3+ complex consists of a mononuclear complex ion [Fe(edtabz)(H2O)]+, the metal ion of which is suited in a distorted
pentagonal bipyramid to be protected from environmental oxygen. The
copper(II) complexes, which have mononuclear structures with high
thermodynamic stability compared with the iron(III) complexes, show
no peroxidase activity. The steric effects play a fundamental role
in the biomimetic activity.

1 Introduction
The studies of metal–ligand
interaction in coordination compounds have constructed an important
research area because the interaction causes and controls the chemical
and biological activities of metal centers. From this viewpoint, various
types of coordination compounds have been designed and their applications
have been exploited in many fields.1−3 In the human organism,
metal ions encompass several crucial functions through metalloproteins.
Among the metalloenzymes that have attracted attention in relation
to the development of biomimetic agents, our special interest is directed
to peroxidases (POx), which are heme proteins that catalyze the degradation
of H2O2 when the human body defends itself against
oxidative damage by superoxide anions. Although the active site of
POx contains iron(III) coordination centers, the evaluation of similar
biomimetic activities has been reported for other transition metal
complexes such as copper(II) complexes, to provide interesting results.4,5 The activity as a biomimetic agent depends, among other factors,
on the conformation of the metal–ligand sphere because the
oxidation state of the metal is changed during the catalysis.6 In our research group, we have developed metal
complexes with macrocyclic and acyclic receptors derived from EDTA
(ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid) with different topologies.7−15 Some of them have coordination modes resembling those found in binuclear
metalloproteins. As background of the present work, significant biomimetic
capacities of superoxide dismutase and POx (peroxidase) have been
found for the binuclear complexes of the EDTA-derived ligands with
copper(II)10 and iron(III),8 respectively. Likewise, they present high antioxidant capacity
without harmful effects on peripheral blood mononuclear cells in vitro.8,10 These promising results suggest that the family of the ligands provides
metal complexes suitable for deepening the knowledge of the structural
and physicochemical factors that control their biomimetic activity;
the major conceivable factors include the structural type of the ligand,
size of the cavity, and number and nature of the metal in the complexes,
all of which can be readily controlled by modifying EDTA with selected
groups. In the present work, we have chosen a macrocycle consisting
of EDTA and aromatic units (edtaodH2 in Scheme 1), for the following reasons:
the phenylene group integrated in the macrocyclic frame results in
the high rigidity which strictly defines the coordination geometry
around the central metal; moreover, electronic interaction between
the coordinated metal ion and aromatic group favors a change in the
oxidation state that may occur in the intermediates of the peroxidase
process. To study the effect of the steric effect due to the macrocyclic
frame, a new open-chain ligand (edtabzH2 in Scheme 1) has been synthesized, which
consists of a chelating EDTA unit linked with phenyl group in a sterically
less-restricted manner. Their Fe3+ and Cu2+ complexes
have been subjected to the tests of peroxidase-like activity; only
the iron(III) complex of edtaodH2 is active. In order to
study the correlation of the biomimetic activity with the structural
and thermodynamic properties, the metal complexes have been characterized
by X-ray diffraction, calorimetric analysis, and UV-spectrometry.
On the basis of the results of these studies, we can verify that a
greater thermodynamic stability of a complex is not necessarily translated
into a better biomimetic activity, but the steric effects may play
a more fundamental role in the biomimetic activity.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Characterization of edtabzH2
Reaction of EDTA dianhydride with aniline gave acyclic ligand edtabzH2 (Scheme 1),
which was characterized by 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy,
Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, and electrospray mass
spectrometry as described in the Experimental Section. The water solubility is high enough for potentiometric and NMR
studies in the pH range 2–12. The logarithmic protonation constants
of edtabz2– were determined by potentiometry in
0.1 M KCl at 25 °C as log[LH]/[L][H] = 6.23 (±0.01) and
log[LH2]/[LH][H] = 3.64 (±0.02); Figure 1 presents the calculated species
distribution. These values are close to the corresponding values 6.07
and 3.7 reported for edtaod2– macrocycle.12 The pD dependence of the 1H NMR chemical
shifts observed for edtabzH2 is shown in Figure 1. The protons labeled a, b,
and c in Scheme 1 shift
downfield with decreasing pD in the range 5.5–8.5, indicating
that the amino nitrogen atoms are protonated. Only the proton b shifts downfield with decreasing pD from 5 to 2, indicating
protonation at carboxylate oxygen. The NMR δ of proton i is expressed by the following function of pD: 1  where βn is the overall protonation constant of n-fold protonation
in D2O media, 10–n(pD) gives D+ concentration, δi,0 is the chemical shift of proton i in the
completely deprotonated species L2–, and δi,n is the chemical shift
in the n-fold protonated species. The shifts of all
proton signals are well reproduced by eq 1 with the values of βn, δi,0, and δi,n presented in the legend of Figure 1. The obtained deuteration
constants, log KD1 = 6.74 (±0.02)
and log KD2 = 3.26 (±0.02), are similar
to the corresponding values 6.94 and 3.89 reported for edtaodH2.

solid lines are calculated using eq 1, with the following values of the parameters: log
β1 = 6.74 and log β2 = 10.00, δa,0 = 2.89, δa,1 = 3.37, δa,2 = 3.42, δb, = 3.32, δb,1 = 3.66,
δb,2 = 3.92, δc,0 = 3.45, δc,1 = 3.98, δc,2 = 4.04, δp,0 = 7.21, δp,1 = 7.22, δp,2 = 7.23,
δm,0 = 7.37, δm,1 = 7.32, δm,2 = 7.35, δo,0 = 7.37, δo,1 = 7.36, δo,2 = 7.39.

The X-ray structure presented in Figure 2 shows that edtabzH2 is crystallized as zwitterion dihydrate, in which one of the carboxyl
hydrogen atoms is transferred to the adjacent amino group. The aromatic
substituents are pointed to the same direction; this orientation is
attributed to crystal packing effects because the aromatic groups
are ca. 5.587 Å distant. The relevant crystallographic information
and final refinement parameters are displayed in Table 1. Selected bond distances, bond
angles, and torsional angles are given in Tables S2–S7 (see
the Supporting Information).

2.2 Cu2+ and Fe3+ Complexation
in Aqueous Solution
Coordination of edtabz2– and edtaod2– with Cu2+ and Fe3+ ions in solution was studied at pH 3.0 by UV–vis spectrometric
titrations and ITC. At this pH, the two ligands are in equilibrium
between LH– and LH2; the amino group
is protonated completely, and the carboxylate group is protonated
partially (Figure 1). Despite the mixed protonation state, the pH 3.0 was selected to
prevent the formation of Fe(OH)3 so that the complexation
of the two metals can be compared. Figure 3 shows the near-UV spectra in the presence
of Cu2+ or Fe3+ ion at different concentrations.
All complexes exhibit intense ligand-to-metal charge-transfer transition
in the range 280–375 nm. The absorbance of every new band increases
almost linearly with the total metal concentration up to the ratio
[M]t/[L]t ≈ 1. Larger changes in the
charge-transfer bands occur in the formation of Fe3+ complexes.
Every titration curve is interpreted by the metal-to-ligand ratio
of 1:1, and it cannot be reproduced by other stoichiometry. The conditional
stability constants were determined using the AFFINIMETER program;
the results are presented in Table 2. The constants are ranged from 105 and
106 M–1 (M = mol dm–3), and higher stability is found for the Cu2+ complexes.

The coordination of edtabzH2 with copper
in basic media was also studied at pH 8.5 at which the L2– species is present at almost 100% level (the observed spectra are
included in the Supporting Information).
A large hypochromic effect is observed for the 246 nm band, and a
hyperchromic effect is observed for the CT band; both changes in absorbance
are linear up to [M]t/[L]t = 1. This greater
spectral change is due to that fact that all donor atoms in L2– can form coordinate bonds without proton dissociation.
For the same reason, the conditional stability constant is as high
as the order of 1013 M–1.

The curves
obtained for the isothermal titrations of edtabzH2 with
Cu2+ and Fe3+ ions are presented in the panels
A and B of Figure 4, respectively (the curves for edtaodH2 are given in Supporting Information). The raw data of both
(A) Cu2+–edtabz2– and (B) Fe3+–edtabz2– systems present exothermic
peaks, which indicate the saturation of the association until small
peaks appear due to heat generated by dilution in the last injections.
The lower panel (C) of Figure 4 presents the integrated data. The thermal change of copper
complexation is steeper with the higher plateau than is the iron complexation,
suggesting that the former is accompanied by the higher affinity and
greater enthalpic contribution. Thermal parameters determined by curve
fittings are summarized in Table 2. The n value of ≈1 is consistent
with the 1:1 stoichiometry determined by the UV–vis titrations.
It is interesting that, in the acidic environment, both the edtabz2– complexes have comparable affinities with ΔG around −10 kcal/mol, while [Cu(edtabz)] bears almost
double the ΔH value of the Fe complex (i.e.,
the former is driven by the entropy effect completely). The stability
constants determined by the calorimetry are higher than those found
by the UV–vis technique. The ITC technique detects all of the
thermal processes involved in the formation of the complex. On the
other hand, the spectrometric technique traces only the spectral change
caused by competition between the complexation and protonation to
determine a conditional constant, which is usually smaller than the
proper constant. Despite the difference, the relative stabilities
determined by the same techniques under identical conditions can be
compared and evidently indicate that the Cu2+ complexes
are more stable than the corresponding Fe3+ complexes and
the acyclic ligand forms more stable metal complexes.

2.3 Characterization in Solid
The copper(II)
and iron(III) complexes with the ligands edtaodH2 and edtabzH2 were isolated in satisfactory yields. The structures of the
metal complexes have been established by various techniques. Some
informative FTIR bands of the ligands and their Cu2+ and
Fe3+ complexes are given in Table 3. The characteristic C=O stretching
band of carboxylic acid in the free ligand appears around 1700 cm–1 and moves to a lower wavenumber side by at least
30 cm–1 upon complex formation. This band shift
indicates that the carboxylate groups participate in the formation
of the complexes. Other bands that are displaced to smaller wavenumber
sides upon complexation are the vibrational bands of amide C=O
and C−N bonds, which indicate that the amide groups are also
involved in the coordination with the metal ions. The X-ray photoelectron
spectra (XPS) are shown in Supporting Information. The Fe3+ complexes of edtaod2– and
edtabz2– exhibit 2p3/2 core-electron
peaks at binding energies of 709.9 and 710.5 eV, respectively; the
energies are consistent with the trivalent state. Each peak is accompanied
by a broad, intense peak at 4–5 eV higher energy. This additional
peak might be due to multiplet splitting caused by five electrons
in the 3d level, but they are normally difficult to observe clearly
because the net effect would broaden the 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 peaks. More viable is a shake-up satellite.16 In the case of the copper(II) complexes, a 2p3/2 peak is observed at 932.7 and 932.8 eV for the complexes
of edtaod2– and edtabz2–, respectively.
Both peaks are accompanied by shake-up satellites which appear characteristically
of the 3d9 open-shell in Cu2+ ion.

2.3.1 X-ray Diffraction Analyses
The
most relevant crystallographic data of {[Fe(edtaod)]2O}
are summarized in Table 1. Figure 5 shows the
molecular structure in which two Fe(edtaod) chelates labeled A and
B are bridged by an oxygen atom. As seen from the perspective views
given for each chelate in Figure 6, the iron(III) ions are each embedded in distorted
octahedral coordination environments. In the equatorial plane, the
Fe1/Fe2 atoms are coordinated by atoms O2A/O2B, N2A/N2B, and N3A/N3B
from the ligand molecules and the bridging oxygen atom O9 so that
a distorted square plane is generated around each central metal ion.
The distortion is seen from the O–Fe–O, O–Fe–N
and N–Fe–N bond angles formed between neighboring atoms
in the plane; the angles range from 77.50(5) to 104.15(5)° (Table 4). The axial positions
of each square plane are occupied by oxygen atoms from the second
carboxylate group (O4A/O4B) and the amide group (O1A/O1B) to construct
an elongated distorted octahedron. As expected, the Fe–Ocarboxylate bond distances [2.0094(12) and 2.0182(12) Å]
are shorter than the Fe–Oamide distances [2.0184(12)
and 2.0358(12) Å]. The Fe–N distances are in the range
of 2.2238(15) to 2.3012(14) Å. Among the Fe–O and Fe–N
distances, the shortest is found for Fe–O9 with 1.7919(12)
and 1.7930(12) Å, which are comparable to those found in other
octahedral complexes of chelating N- and O-donor ligands with Fe–O–Fe
bridging. The interatomic distance between the bridged Fe(III) ions
is 3.4692(7) Å, which falls well within the normal range observed
for μ-oxo monobridged Fe(III) dimers.17 The Fe(III)–O–Fe(III) angle is 150.80(7)°. The
crystallographic structures of the ligand edtaodH2 and
its copper complex [Cu(edtaod)]·H2O have been reported
already.11 Both metal complexes of this
ligand crystallize with the same space group (Pbca), but there are major differences in the coordination geometries.
In [Cu(edtaod)], the octahedral coordination sphere is accomplished
with the oxygen atom from a carboxyl group of an adjacent chelate
molecule, whereas in {[Fe(edtaod)]2O}·4.4H2O the [Fe(edtaod)]+ complex ions are coordinated to an
oxide anion forming the μ-oxo bridge between them. The connectivity
is strengthened further by two intramolecular N–H···O
hydrogen bonds formed between one of the amide hydrogens and a carbonyl
oxygen atom from one of the metal-coordinated carboxylate groups (N4A–H4A···O2B
and N4B–H4B···O2A; not shown in Figure 6).

The iron(III) complex of edtabz2– is isolated in the form of the nitrate salt and crystallized as
hydrate with composition Fe(edtabz)NO3·5.5H2O. This metal complex is mononuclear with the coordination of a water
molecule to form [Fe(edtabz) (H2O)]+, in contrast
to μ-oxo bridge formation in {[Fe(edtaod)]2O}·4.4H2O. The iron(III) center in [Fe(edtabz)(H2O)]+ exhibits seven-fold coordination with the FeO5N2 core embedded in a distorted pentagonal-bipyramidal
geometry (Figure 7).

In the coordination polyhedron, the amino nitrogen
atoms and the amide oxygen atoms of the edtabz2– ligand occupy four positions in the equatorial plane, while the

water molecule comprises the remaining equatorial site (Figure 7). The O–Fe–O,
O–Fe–N and N–Fe–N bond angles formed between
neighboring atoms in the equatorial plane range from 70.13(5) to 74.03(5)°
(Table 5). The O–Fe–O
bond angle between the axial substituents is 160.71(6)°. The
Fe–Namine, Fe–Oamide, Fe–Ocarboxylate, and Fe–Ow distances are 2.3276(16)–2.3534(15),
2.1892(13)–2.1477(13), 1.9435(13)–1.9609(13), and 2.0282(14)
Å, respectively (Table 5); these distances are similar to the values established for
{[Fe(edtaod)]2O}·4.4H2O and other structurally
related iron(III) complexes reported previously.18,19 In the crystal structure, adjacent [Fe(edtabz)(H2O)]+ molecules are linked together through strong O–H···O
hydrogen-bonding interactions between the Fe–OH2 water molecules and one of the carboxylate oxygen atoms [OW1···O6
= 2.687(2) Å], yielding dimeric aggregates with a Fe···Fe
distance of 5.3181(5) Å. There are no direct intermolecular contacts
between the metal chelate and nitrate ions.

2.4 Peroxidase-like Activity
The capability
of acting as peroxidase mimetics was determined for the ligands and
their metal complexes in phosphate buffer solution (pH 7.4), as the
assay kit was supplied. At pH 3 which ITC was studied, the reference
peroxidase is not stable enough for use. The thermodynamic data, however,
are supposed to be informative of the relation between the relative
stability and peroxidase-like activity at pH 7.4. As shown in Table 6, the Fe3+–edtaod2– system shows the most significant
peroxidase-like capability with a specific activity equivalent to
0.24 ± 0.04 mU/mL horseradish peroxidase (HRP).

a Macrocycle derived from two edta
and two bis(4-aminophenyl) ether [ref (8)].

The activity of the Fe3+–edtaod2– complex is higher than the values 0.13 mU/mL HRP
(at a final concentration of 1 × 10–4 M) reported
for some binuclear Fe3+ complexes of macrocycles derived
from EDTA and aromatic diamines,8 in contrast
to the inactiveness of the Fe3+–edtabz2– complex. The catalytic cycle of HRP in cells is initiated by hydrogen
peroxide through an electron oxidation of the ferric ground state
of the enzyme, and the resulting transient oxo-Fe4+ complex
is then reduced by an electron transfer from the substrate. This process
can be repeated by a second hydrogen peroxide molecule reacts to return
the iron to its state ferric ground state.20 The Fe3+–edtaod2– complex is
supposed to form a dimeric structure with a μ-oxo bridge in
solution as found by the X-ray study because the mass spectrum exhibits
the dimeric-molecular species with well-defined isotope peaks—without
showing any peak attributable to monomeric species (the spectrum is
given in the Supporting Information). The
metal center of the [Fe(edtaod)]+ unit is displaced from
the plane constructed by ligand atoms to be exposed to environment,
owing to the steric effect of the rigid macrocyclic framework (Figure 6). As a result, the
Fe3+ center can capture an O2– ion and
can stabilize the transient Fe4+ state during peroxidase
action. The inactiveness of the Fe3+–edtabz2– complex is attributable to the coordination geometry
of [Fe(edtabz)(H2O)]+ in which the metal ion
is so well suited in the coordination sphere formed by the donor atoms
of the ligand as to be protected against an O2– ion
(Figure 7). Thus, the
structural features of the two Fe3+ chelates cause the
difference in their ability to mimic peroxidase, as pointed out for
pyridyl based macrocyclic Fe3+ complexes.21

The inactiveness of the ligands is predictable because
of the lack of transition metal centers. The negligible activity of
the Cu2+ complexes may be related to the relative stability
of the transient complexes [Cu3+(edtaod)]+ and
[Cu3+(edtabz)]+ formed in the course of peroxidase
action because the lower stability of the transient complexes the
lower ability of metal center to mimic the catalytic cycle described
by a peroxidase.20,22

3 Conclusions
We have synthesized and
characterized a new open-chain ligand edtabzH2 derived
from EDTA and carried out the comparative study of the Cu2+ and Fe3+ complexes and the corresponding complexes of
an EDTA-derived macrocycle edtaodH2. The stability constants
determined by the ITC technique for the Cu2+ and Fe3+ complexes of edtabzH2 ligand are higher than
those obtained for the corresponding metal complexes of edtaodH2. The stability constants determined by UV–vis also
have found that the Cu2+ complexes are more stable than
the Fe3+ complexes, and the acyclic ligand forms more stable
metal complexes than does the macrocyclic ligand. No evidence was
found for the macrocyclic effect on the stability of the complexes.
The X-ray diffraction study of the acyclic ligand revealed that two
aromatic groups are oriented to the same direction. In solution, a
closer interannular contact may be induced by the hydrophobic effect
to preorganize a pseudo-macrocyclic cavity. The macrocyclic ligand
edtaodH2 is naturally preorganized for complexation, but
the small rigid frame generates a high steric hindrance, decreasing
the stability even for copper, which normally has the highest affinity
with O, N-ligands among transition metals. The X-ray studies indicate
that edtabz2– forms a larger number of coordinate
bonds as a result of its flexible frame that can adapt to the ionic
radii of iron and copper. The Fe–edtaodH2 complex
presents a significant POx biomimetic activity, whereas the Fe–edtabzH2 complex is almost inactive despite a larger number of coordinate
bonds. This fact indicates that the activity is controlled not only
by stability but also by other factors such as the geometry of the
complex. The X-ray structure of {[Fe(edtaod)]2O} involves
oxygen of the external origin within the first coordination sphere.
Probably, the POx biomimetic associates with this oxygen, which exchanges
with the oxygen of superoxide radical and makes Fe3+ ion
responsible for the process of dismutation to create hydrogen peroxide
from molecular oxygen. In the Fe–edtabzH2 complex,
the coordination sphere of the metal ion is totally occupied by the
donor atoms of the ligand. Thus, the acyclic ligand has higher affinity
to Fe3+ and Cu2+ ions so that they may be useful
for chelating agents in metal intoxication rather than artificial
POx mimics.

4 Experimental Section
All reagents used
were of analytical grade. N,N-Dimethylformamide
(DMF, Fisher Scientific) was dried with molecular sieves for 24 h,
and other solvents were used without further purification. The solutions
of Cu(NO3)2·2.5H2O and Fe(NO3)3·9H2O were standardized by EDTA
complexometry.

4.1 Synthesis of the Ligands
The macrocycle
edtaodH2 (Scheme 1) was synthesized by the method reported previously, and the
purity was checked by measurement of the decomposition point as well
as IR and 1H NMR spectra.12

The acyclic ligand edtabzH2 (Scheme 1) was obtained by a reaction of ethylenediaminetetraacetic
dianhydride with aniline. To 2.4 g (9.3 mmol) of EDTA dianhydride
dissolved in 8 mL of dry DMF was added 2 mL (20 mmol) of aniline distilled
in advance. The resulting reaction mixture was left to stand overnight.
Any solids were filtered out. The filtrate was concentrated by a rotary
evaporator to 5 mL, into which acetone was added. Precipitates formed
were filtered off, washed with acetone several times until a colorless
solid was obtained. It was dried in vacuum for 8 h at room temperature.

Mass spectrum (ESI–) m/z: 441.1 (100%), [(M – H)−].

4.2 Syntheses of Copper(II) and Iron(III) Complexes
The metal complexes were synthesized by reactions between appropriate
metal nitrates and ligands. The ligands were in 10% excess to ensure
complete coordination of metals in the 1:1 complexation. In 15 mL
of water, 0.46 mmol of an appropriate ligand was suspended and solubilized
by adding solid Li2CO3. To the solution was
added a 10 mL aqueous solution of 0.42 mmol of an appropriated metal
nitrate with stirring. Pale blue color was developed in the reaction
of copper, and brilliant orange color was in the iron complexation.
After stirring was continued for 30 min, the solution was heated at
a temperature between 40 and 50 °C. When it was concentrated
to half the initial volume, the product started to precipitate. Crystalline
powder was filtered off and dried in vacuum for about 8 h at room
temperature. The crystals of the metal complexes are stable in air
without efflorescing. They were characterized by IR, ESI-MS spectra,
X-ray diffraction analyses, and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA).

4.3 Crystal Growth
Crystals of edtabzH2 were grown by diffusing acetone into an aqueous solution
placed at the bottom of a small-bore tube. After 2 days, crystals
suitable for SCXRD analysis were obtained. Crystals of the iron(III)
complexes were obtained by the saturation method. An aqueous solution
of the metal nitrate was added into a concentrated solution of edtabzH2 or edtaodH2 at ∼60 °C under stirring.
Heating and stirring were ceased after 30 min, and the solutions were
left to evaporate at ambient temperature. Red crystals suitable for
SCXRD analysis were formed in 3 or 4 days.

4.4 Potentiometric Titration
The potentiometric
titration of edtabzH2 was carried out using Dosimat plus
Metrohm semiautomatic titrator consisting of a 20 mL burette and a
jacketed titration cell at a controlled temperature of 25.0 ±
0.1 °C under a nitrogen atmosphere. The pH was determined by
a Metrohm model 827 pH meter equipped with a combination electrode
model 6.00228.010. The electrode was calibrated with 0.01 M HCl and
0.01 M CO2-free KOH in 0.1 M KCl by assuming complete dissociation
of the strong acid and base, so as to determine molar hydrogen-ion
concentration. Based on Gran’s plots, pKw was obtained to be 13.78. Precisely weighed 44.2 mg of edtabzH2 was dissolved in a mixture of deaerated 0.1 M KCl solution
(100 mL) and 0.1 M HCl (1.5 mL); the initial concentration of edtabzH2 was ca. 1 × 10–3 M. Nitrogen gas humidified
by 0.1 KCl was bubbled for 1 h in the sample solution before titration,
to minimize the effects of O2 and CO2. Titration
was performed by adding a standardized 0.10 M KOH in 0.05 mL increments
under a nitrogen atmosphere. The computer program HYPERQUAD was used
to calculate the protonation constants. The titration curves of the
metal–ligand systems were unable to be interpreted probably
because of the complexity especially in the iron complexation.

4.5 Spectroscopic Measurements
The 1H and 13C NMR spectra were obtained with a Bruker
AVANCE 400 spectrometer for D2O solutions at a probe temperature
of approximately 23 °C. The internal reference was sodium 2,2-dimethyl-2-silanpentane-5-sulfonate
(DSS). For the study of pD dependence, a minimum quantity of diluted
KOD or DCl solution was used to adjust the pD of the sample solutions.
The pH value of each sample solution was measured with a long-stem
combination electrode inserted into the NMR tube after NMR experiments.
The electrode was calibrated with standard aqueous buffers, and the
measured pH values were converted to the pD values by the relation
pD = pHmeas + 0.44.23

IR spectra were recorded on a PerkinElmer FT-IR Spectrometer Model
Frontier equipped with ATR accessory. UV–visible spectroscopy
was carried out using PerkinElmer LAMBDA 45. For the studies of complexation
at a constant pH, the stock solution of the ligand was made at a concentration
of 5 × 10–4 M, and the stock solutions of the
metal ions were prepared form the appropriate nitrates so that the
concentrations were about 30 times those of the ligand stock solutions.
Titrations were carried out at pH 3 adjusted with 0.1 M HCl/NaCl.
A quartz cuvette of the spectrometer was loaded with 3 mL of a stock
solution of a ligand studied, to which 10 μL aliquots of an
appropriate metal stock solution were added successively with a calibrated
micropipette so that the ratios of the total concentrations [M]t/[L]t were in a desired range. Each spectrum was
recorded after the sample solution was stirred thoroughly for 3 min.
The titration of the Cu–edtabzH2 system was carried
out in 0.1 M CAPSO buffer at pH 8.5 as well.

The high-resolution
XPS of Fe and Cu 2p electrons were taken using PerkinElmer PHI 5100
with a Mg Kα source under a vacuum of 4 × 10–9 Torr. Each peak was referenced to C 1s (285.0 eV). Curve fitting
of the peaks was performed assuming a Gaussian–Lorentzian function
with baseline correction.

Mass spectra of electrospray ionization
(ESI/MS) were obtained on 6130 Quadrupole LC/MS of Agilent Technologies,
in the negative and positive ionization modes.

TGA was carried
out on a thermogravimetric analyzer PerkinElmer Pyris 1 TGA for studying
the thermal stability and compositions of the complexes. A sample
with an initial weight of 5 mg was set in a ceramic pan and analyzed
in a temperature ranging of 25–800 °C under N2 or O2 atmosphere.

4.6 Calorimetric Measurements
Microcalorimetry
was performed using a MicroCal VP-ITC microcalorimeter at a temperature
of 298.15 K, stirrer speed of 307 rpm, filter period of 2 s, and reference
power of 10 μJ s–1. A ligand solution was
titrated with an appropriate metal nitrate solution for four reaction
systems, Fe–edtabzH2, Cu–edtabzH2, Fe–edtaodH2, and Cu–edtaodH2. The stock solutions 0.02 M of the metal nitrates were standardized
by EDTA titration prior to each experiment. To prevent the hydrolysis
of Fe(NO3)3, the stock solution was acidified
with a 2% HNO3. All measurements were carried out at pH
3.0 in 0.05 M potassium hydrogen phthalate buffer. The influence of
the buffer on the complexation was negligible, as confirmed by blank
tests: the injection of the metal solution into the buffer alone generated
small peaks that were due to dilution unaccompanied by complexation.
The raw data were corrected by subtracting the heat of dilution. The
titration curves were analyzed with AFFINIMETER application software,
which provides thermodynamic and kinetic parameters.24 The conditions of each titration system are reported in
the Supporting Information.

4.7 Single-Crystal X-ray Diffraction Analyses
Diffraction data were obtained on Bruker APEX (for edtabzH2·2H2O), APEX II DUO (for {[Fe(edtaod)]2O}·4.4H2O), and D8 QUEST (for [Fe(edtabz)]NO3·5.5H2O) diffractometer systems equipped with
a monochromator and a CDD area detector, using either Cu Kα
(λ = 1.54178 Å) or Mo Kα (λ = 0.71073 Å)
radiation. The measured intensities were reduced to F2 and corrected for absorption using the multiscan method
SADABS.25 Corrections were made for Lorentz
and polarization effects. Structure solution, refinement, and data
output were performed with the OLEX226 program
package using SHEXLT27 for the structure
solution and SHELXL28 for the refinement.
Nonhydrogen atoms were refined anisotropically. C–H hydrogen
atoms were placed in geometrically calculated positions based on the
riding model. N–H and O–H hydrogen atoms were located
from difference Fourier maps and refined with distance restraints.

The ligand edtabzH2·2H2O crystallizes
in the form of a zwitterion hydrate with two crystallographically
independent water molecules in the asymmetric unit. In the crystal
structure of [Fe(edtabz)]NO3·5.5H2O, nitrate
counterion is disordered over two positions. For the refinement of
the disorder, Uij restraints
(DELU) and geometric restrictions (FLAT) were employed. Aside from
the water molecule (OW1) coordinated to the iron atom, this crystal
structure comprises six crystallographically independent sites with
uncoordinated water molecules (OW2–OW7) having occupancies
of 1.00 (OW2, OW4–OW7) and 0.50 (OW3). Among these, four molecules
labeled OW2, OW4, OW5, and OW7 that are disordered over two positions
were refined without hydrogen atoms. The asymmetric unit of {[Fe(edtaod)]2O}·4.4H2O is constituted by the binuclear
iron(III) complex and five crystallographically independent uncoordinated
water molecules (OW1–OW5), two of which (OW4 and OW5) were
refined with an occupancy of 0.70. Crystal structure analyses were
performed with Mercury,29 and Diamond30 was used for the creation of figures.

4.8 Peroxidase-like Activity
Peroxidase-like
activity was determined using the Amplex Red Hydrogen Peroxide/Peroxidase
Assay Kit (Invitrogen cat. no. A22188) which is provided in the form
of phosphate buffer solution (pH 7.4). The assay was performed pH
in a total volume of 100 μL per microplate well. A standard
curve was prepared to determine the activity of HRP in a concentration
range of 0–2 mU/mL. The wells were loaded individually with
50 μL of the standard material and test materials (edtaodH2, edtabzH2, and their copper(II) and iron(III)
complexes), and every sample solution was adjusted to a final concentration
of 1 × 10–3 M. To each well, 50 μL of
a working solution was added to start the reaction; the working solution
was composed of a 1 × 10–4 M Amplex Red reagent
(10-acetyl-3,7-dihydroxyphenoxazine) and 2 × 10–3 M H2O2 in 0.25 M sodium phosphate, pH 7.4.
After incubation at room temperature for 30 min under protection from
light, the absorbance of each solution in the wells was measured with
a microplate reader at 550 nm. The specific activities were determined
by correlating the absorbance readings to a peroxidase standard curve
prepared with HRP and were reported as mU/mL of HRP activity.
