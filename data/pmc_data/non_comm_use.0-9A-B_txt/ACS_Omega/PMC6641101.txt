Over
the last decade, we have investigated and exploited the photophysical
properties of triangulenium dyes. Azadioxatriangulenium (ADOTA) and
diazaoxatriangulenium (DAOTA), in particular, have features that make
them useful in various fluorescence-based technologies (e.g., bioimaging).
Through our work with ADOTA and DAOTA, we became aware that the reported
fluorescence quantum yields (ϕfl) for these dyes
are lower than their actual values. We thus set out to further investigate
the fundamental structure–property relationships in these unique
conjugated cationic systems. The nonradiative processes in the systems
were explored using transient absorption spectroscopy and time-resolved
emission spectroscopy in combination with computational chemistry.
The influence of molecular oxygen on the fluorescence properties was
explored, and the singlet oxygen sensitization efficiencies of ADOTA
and DAOTA were determined. We conclude that, for these dyes, the amount
of nonradiative deactivation of the first excited singlet state (S1) of the azaoxa-triangulenium fluorophores is low, that the
rate of such deactivation is slower than what is observed in common
cationic dyes, that there are no observable radiative transitions
occurring from the first excited triplet state (T1) of
these dyes, and that the efficiency of sensitized singlet oxygen production
is low (ϕΔ ≤ 10%). These photophysical
results provide a solid base upon which technological applications
of these fluorescent dyes can be built.

Introduction
The triangulenium dyes
constitute a group of organic dyes that
have a planar, fully conjugated triangulenium core in common.1−4 The structure is formally a cationic heterotriangulene,5 a structure first discussed by Clar.6 The first triangulenium dye was prepared by Martin
and Smith in 1964,7 and the compound class
has since been expanded with dyes that can be considered as extended
rhodamines,1,8,9 fluoresceines,10 and the unique azaoxa-triangulenium dyes.2,3 Whereas the former have donor groups on the periphery of the aromatic
system contributing to the chromophore properties of the dyes, the
latter has the chromophore restricted to the triangulenium core. This
gives the azaoxa-triangulenium dyes distinctive photophysical properties,
such as a long fluorescence lifetime (τfl > 20
ns)
despite emission in the red.11−14 Triangulenium dyes with only aza bridges and with
thio bridges have also been prepared.15−18 These have found use in molecular
electronics,19−21 but their dye properties make them less interesting
for applications based on fluorescence.

The azaoxa-triangulenium
dyes are cationic fluorophores, where
the most relevant are azadioxatriangulenium (ADOTA) and diazaoxatriangulenium
(DAOTA).12,14 The molecular structures of ADOTA and DAOTA
are shown in Scheme 1. The dyes can be prepared with a variety of groups on the aza bridges
and with various counter ions (X–).22 The long fluorescence lifetime of these dyes has been exploited
in time-resolved imaging, polarization-based experiments, and metal-enhanced
fluorescence,23−33 and the dyes have been used in bioimaging.34−36 Through our
experiments with ADOTA and DAOTA, we became aware that the reported
fluorescence quantum yields are most likely too low. Thus, we decided
to re-examine the fundamental photophysical properties of these dyes
to establish a better foundation onto which future applications could
be built.

Scheme 1 Molecular Structures of ADOTA and DAOTA
X– is the anion.

Here,
the photophysical properties of three ADOTA derivatives and
three DAOTA derivatives are investigated in acetonitrile (MeCN) and
dichloromethane (DCM). Deactivation of the first excited singlet state
(S1) was characterized using steady-state and time-resolved
fluorescence spectroscopy. Deactivation via the triplet manifold was
investigated using low-temperature spectroscopy and transient absorption
spectroscopy and monitoring the sensitized formation of singlet oxygen.
Computations were used to support the spectroscopic measurements,
to investigate the excited state molecular structure and to map the
excited state manifold of ADOTA and DAOTA. The computational results
showed that the structural difference between the ground-state (S0) equilibrium structure and the first singlet excited state
(S1) equilibrium structure has a pronounced effect on the
photophysical properties observed for ADOTA and DAOTA.

We conclude
that the substitution of the nitrogen bridges in the
azaoxa-triangulenium systems has a minor influence on the fluorescence
properties, with average quantum yields of fluorescence (ϕfl) for ADOTA and DAOTA in air-saturated MeCN of ϕfl(ADOTA) = 0.67 ± 0.03 and ϕfl(DAOTA)
= 0.55 ± 0.04 for a series of three different substitution patterns.
In DCM, the average fluorescence quantum yield increases to ϕfl(ADOTA) = 0.82 ± 0.01 and ϕfl(DAOTA)
= 0.78 ± 0.02 and is further increased when the solution is saturated
with nitrogen [ = 0.88 ± 0.04 and  = 0.85 ± 0.04].
Our study indicates
that all deactivation pathways from the first excited singlet state
(S1) of these azaoxa-triangulenium dyes are slower than
that observed in common cationic dyes. We find that quenching by molecular
oxygen and intersystem crossing are the dominant processes that compete
with spontaneous emission. However, because quenching by molecular
oxygen is comparatively inefficient for
these electron-deficient systems, the result is a high quantum yield
and long lifetime of fluorescence despite a low oscillator strength
and the accompanying slow rate of spontaneous emission.

Methods and Materials
Dyes and
Solvents
All chemicals were used as received.
All solvents used for spectroscopic experiments were of high-performance
liquid chromatography (HPLC) grade and used as received. The dyes
used were of analytical grade (99+% by HPLC monitored at 250 nm).
The following salts were used: N-methyl-azadioxatriangulenium
hexafluorophosphate (MeADOTA, R = CH3, X– = PF6, Scheme 1), N-propyl-azadioxatriangulenium
hexafluorophosphate (PrADOTA, R = n-C3H7, X– = PF6, Scheme 1), N-phenyl-azadioxatriangulenium tetrafluoroborate
(PhADOTA, R = C6H5, X– = BF4–, Scheme 1), N,N′-dimethyl-diazaoxatriangulenium
hexafluorophosphate (MeDAOTA, R = R′ = CH3, X– = PF6–, Scheme 1), N,N′-dipropyl-diazaoxatriangulenium
hexafluorophosphate (PrDAOTA, R = R′ = n-C3H7, X– = PF6–, Scheme 1), and N,N′-diphenyl-diazaoxatriangulenium
hexafluorophosphate (PhDAOTA, R = R′ = C6H5, X– = PF6–, Scheme 1). The compounds
were synthesized as previously reported.2,3,17 MeDAOTA and PhDAOTA are new compounds, and their
synthesis and characterization are included in the Supporting Information.

Spectroscopy
Absorption,
excitation and emission spectra,
fluorescence quantum yields, and lifetimes were measured and determined
using standard procedures. Fluorescence spectra were recorded using
an l-configuration fluorimeter (PTI QuantaMaster300 and FluoTime300
from PicoQuant). Emission and excitation spectra were corrected using
the factory supplied correction files for system response (monochromator,
polarizers, and detector), and illumination source fluctuations were
corrected using an internal photodiode for the excitation spectra.
Absorption spectra were recorded using a Lambda 1050 double-beam spectrophotometer
from Perkin-Elmer using the pure solvent as a reference. Time-gated
emission spectra were recorded using an LS55B luminescence spectrometer
from Perkin-Elmer, equipped with a liquid nitrogen bath cryostat.
For all fluorescence measurements, the absorbance at the excitation
wavelength and at longer wavelengths was kept below 0.1 to avoid inner
filter effects. All fluorescence experiments at ambient temperatures
were performed in 10.00 mm Hellma quartz fluorescence cuvettes. Experiments
performed in oxygen- and nitrogen-saturated solutions were performed
by saturating the solutions with pure gases. The gases were not saturated
with solvent before use. The concentration changes due to the evaporation
of solvents were corrected by recording the absorption spectrum of
all solutions; see Figures S50–S57.

For the steady-state fluorescence measurements, the dyes
were excited at 507 nm using a solid-state laser-excitation source
(LDH-P-C-510 from PicoQuant), and fluorescence spectra were recorded
at magic angle settings. Fluorescence quantum yields were determined
by a relative method using eq 1, with rhodamine 6G in absolute ethanol as standard (ϕfl = 0.95 ± 0.015).37,38 All emission spectra
were corrected for the wavelength-dependent response of the detection
system before use in the fluorescence quantum yield determinations.
The fluorescence quantum yields were finally determined from the slopes
of the linear fits (Δ), when the integrated fluorescence intensity
(I) was plotted as a function of the fraction of
absorbed light (fA, see eq 2).38 All
quantum yield plots are shown in the Supporting Information. 1   2  Demas/Crosby
correction: refractive index
correction is required to compare kf determined
in different solvents, as the radiative rate constant is derived from
an intensity-based experiment.39,40 A correction related
to the specific geometry of the spectrometer, primarily to compensate
for refraction at the sample–air interface, is required to
make intensity-based results in general (nd2 correction was used here).39

Fluorescence lifetimes were measured using a hybrid-PMT detector
(HPD-06 from PicoQuant) with a spectral range of 200–670 nm
using a FluoTime300 system from PicoQuant and pulsed laser diode excitation
(450/470/507 nm). The instrument-response function was recorded at
the excitation wavelength using a dilute solution of Ludox. The fluorescence
decays were analyzed using the FluoFit Professional software package.
The decay data were all found to be monoexponential and were fitted
by iterative reconvolution with a single exponential function. For
all fits, χ2 ≤ 1.1. All time-resolved emission
decay profiles and fits are shown in the Supporting Information.

The time-gated emission spectra were recorded
in nitrogen-saturated
solutions in MeCN and DCM at room temperature. Further time-gated
emission spectra and steady-state fluorescence spectra were recorded
in methanol, EPA (diethylether/pentane/ethyl alcohol), and MeTHF (rac-2-methyltetrahydrofurane) glasses at 77 K. No emission that could
be assigned to the triplet state could be detected.

The equipment
and methods used to determine singlet oxygen, O2(a1Δg), quantum yields, and ϕΔ, have been described in detail previously.41−43 Briefly, the
dyes were excited using femtosecond laser pulses centered
at 417 nm, and the photosensitization of O2(a1Δg) was followed via its characteristic phosphorescence
signal at ∼1275 nm, which was isolated using a 1064 nm long
pass filter and a 1290:80 nm band pass filter placed in front of a
near-IR-sensitive PMT detector. For MeCN solutions, the time-resolved
signals were fitted to a single exponential decay function, whereas
a fit based on the difference between two exponential functions was
needed to describe the signals obtained from DCM solutions owing to
a short (∼1 μs) rise in the signal.44 For all samples, the lifetime of O2(a1Δg) retrieved from the fits in the respective solvents
[τΔ(DCM) = 95 ± 1 μs and τΔ(MeCN) = 79 ± 2 μs] coincided with what is
expected based on published data.45,46 [Note that
methanol-stabilized DCM was used for the O2(a1Δg) measurements to avoid photosensitization and/or
quenching by other stabilizers commonly used.47] The integrated intensities of the singlet oxygen phosphorescence
signals were determined as a function of incident laser power and
compared to the corresponding data from a reference sample: singlet
oxygen produced by the sensitizer phenalenone [ϕΔ(DCM) = 0.96 ± 0.08 and ϕΔ(MeCN) = 1.00
± 0.03].48

Transient absorption
experiments were performed with the same femtosecond-laser
excitation source at 417 nm and detection in the range of ∼500–880
nm using a previously described setup.49 Using this setup, we were not able to detect any long-lived transient
absorption signal (lifetime > 100 ns) that could be assigned to
triplet–triplet
absorption. However, we did observe a short-lived negative absorption
signal (lifetime < 100 ns) that we assign to the combined effect
of S1 bleaching and fluorescence.

Computational Chemistry
The photophysical properties
were also investigated through computations. Excitation energies and
transition dipole moments (TDMs) of the most important singlet transitions
of MeADOTA were computed with TD-DFT50−52 and three commonly used
density functionals. The results were benchmarked with generally more
reliable coupled cluster and multireference multiconfigurational calculations.
The functionals that
performed the best were applied while calculating the electronic transitions
of PhADOTA, MeDAOTA, and PhDAOTA as well. All calculations were performed
considering the molecules in vacuo.

The hybrid density functional
B3LYP,53 its long-range corrected version
CAM-B3LYP,54 and the hybrid density functional
M0655 were tested. The B3LYP and M06 functionals
have been shown to be excellent for calculations of excitation energies
in several TD-DFT benchmark studies.56−59 CAM-B3LYP was chosen for a potential
improvement over B3LYP.60−62 Furthermore, the CC2 method63 was used as the coupled cluster reference because
it has been shown that CC2 tends to reproduce CC3 excitation energies
better than CCSD.64−67 In all calculations, Dunning’s correlation-consistent basis
sets68 were used.69 The cardinal numbers of the basis sets were increased until the
results showed sufficient convergence. Finally, MS-RASPT2//SA-RASSCF
was used as reference for an advanced multiconfigurational method.70−73 These calculations used an ANO-RCC-PVTZ basis set,71,74 default Choleski decomposition,75 default
IPEA shift 0.25,76 an imaginary shift value
of 0.1,77 and an active space comprising
10 orbitals in RAS1, 4 orbitals in RAS2, 8 orbitals in RAS3, 24 active
electrons, and 2 or 3 holes/excitations in RAS1/3 (denoted later as
PT2-2HE and PT2-3HE, respectively). Different numbers of deleted virtual
orbitals were also tested for the convergence of the results.

The CC2 and B3LYP calculations were performed using the TURBOMOLE
6.5 program.78 For evaluation of the two-electron
integrals, the resolution of the identity method (RI) was applied
with auxiliary basis sets from the TURBOMOLE library.79 The frozen core approximation was used in the coupled cluster
computations. The calculations with CAM-B3LYP and M06 were performed
using Gaussian 09.80,81 The PT2-2HE and PT2-3HE calculations
were performed using MOLCAS version 7.8.82

According to the Franck–Condon principle, the excitation
energies and TDMs of the absorption processes were calculated using
the calculated equilibrium structure of the ground states. To analyze the
properties of the fluorescence and phosphorescence processes, the
structures were optimized without symmetry constraints in their first
excited singlet and triplet states, respectively. Due to the computational
cost of MS-RASPT2 calculations, geometry-optimized structures obtained
at the B3LYP/cc-pVTZ level of theory were used when computing PT2-2HE
and PT2-3HE reference excitation energies.

As a result of the
benchmark study, the values reported were obtained
by the following approach: B3LYP/cc-pVTZ was used for geometry optimizations,
whereas the transition energies were calculated for the larger cc-pVQZ
basis set. For all geometry optimizations, the validity of the results
was confirmed by the absence of the imaginary vibrational frequencies;
see the Supporting Information for details.
The singlet TDMs were computed by the application of CAM-B3LYP/cc-pVQZ.
The oscillator strengths were calculated from B3LYP energies and CAM-B3LYP
TDMs.

Excited State Kinetics
The nomenclature used follows
that of textbooks on fluorescence. The relationship between the determined
fluorescence quantum yield [ϕfl = kf/(kf + knr)] and the observed fluorescence lifetime [τfl = 1/kobs = 1/(kf + knr)] described in eq 3 can be used to determine kf, the fluorescence rate constant, and knr, the rate constant for nonradiative depopulation
of S1. The fluorescence rate constant kf is also called the radiative rate constant and is the
reciprocal of the radiative lifetime τ0 = 1/kf. The error in determining these rate constants
is dominated by the error in the quantum yield determination. 3  The nonradiative
depopulation of the first
excited state S1 occurs via two unimolecular processes:
internal conversion to the ground state (S0) described
by the rate of internal conversion kic and intersystem crossing to the triplet manifold occurring with
the rate constant kiscS→T. If there are molecular quenchers
present, bimolecular terms must be included. Of importance in our
case is quenching by molecular oxygen kO2[O2]. Equation 4 shows the relationship between the fluorescence lifetime
τfl and kobs, the observed
rate constant for the depopulation of S1. The latter is
the sum of all rate constants depopulating S1 4  In eq 4, the oxygen-dependent
processes are described by a single
rate constant, even though the interaction of oxygen with the singlet
excited state (S1) may occur through multiple pathways
(i.e., oxygen-induced intersystem crossing: S1 →
T1 and internal conversion: S1 → S0).83−85

Results and Discussion
The electronic
transitions in ADOTA and DAOTA have previously been
investigated using optical spectroscopy.3,12,14,23,33 All observed transitions are related to the singlet manifold of
the two dyes, which implies that all transition dipoles are in the
plane of the molecules,12 as the symmetry
of the chromophore core is C2v. The primary transitions (S0 → S1) of ADOTA and DAOTA are to the states of 1A1 and the 1B2 symmetries, respectively, whereas
the symmetries are reversed for the second transition (S0 → S2) with 1B2 and 1A1 for ADOTA and DAOTA.12 In the molecular structure, this is related to the position of the
nitrogen donor atoms, where the primary transition dipole moment is
on the axis of the molecule containing the nitrogen donor atom(s).
Optical transitions between the triplet and singlet states, such as
phosphorescence, are spin forbidden. We have previously not been able
to observe direct triplet absorption or phosphorescence by applying
the commonly used methods.86Figure 1 shows the two lowest energy
transitions in the absorption spectra and the fluorescence spectra
of MeADOTA and MeDAOTA. The transitions in DAOTA are red-shifted compared
with ADOTA, with λmax(ADOTA|DCM) = 543 nm/λmax(DAOTA|DCM) = 555 nm and λfl(ADOTA|DCM)
= 552 nm/λfl(DAOTA|DCM) = 574 nm. This is a direct
consequence of the higher donor strength of nitrogen compared with
that of oxygen.87,88 The stronger donor groups in
DAOTA also result in a larger oscillator strength in this system.12 The unique feature of the azaoxa-triangulenium
dyes is a long fluorescence lifetimes (τfl ≥
20 ns). The question remains as to why the nonradiative processes
from S1 (described by knr)
are so slow that the radiative process (kf) becomes the dominating process for deactivating S1.

(MeADOTA) and N,N′-dimethyl-diazaoxatriangulenium
hexafluorophosphate (MeDAOTA) in DCM.

We started the investigation by recording the absorption
and fluorescence
spectra for three derivatives of ADOTA and three derivatives of DAOTA
in MeCN and DCM. For all derivatives, varying only the substituents
on nitrogen, the absorption spectra and the fluorescence excitation
spectra are found to be close to identical and the emission spectra
are similar; see Figures S1–S12.
Two low energy transitions of intermediate intensity (5000 < ε
< 20 000 M–1 cm–1) are
observed for the chromophores in the visible part of the spectrum
(Figure 1), whereas
high-intensity localized transitions can be observed in the UV region
of the spectrum.12 The fluorescence emission
appears to obey both the mirror image rule and Kasha’s rule
(i.e., fluorescence occurs exclusively from the first excited singlet
state; see the Supporting Information).89,90 It is worth to note the more detailed vibrational progression that
can be observed in DCM compared with MeCN. In general, DCM is the
best solvent for studying cationic dyes without interference from
solvent effects or ion pairing.91,92 MeCN is a very good
solvent for solubilizing triangulenium ions, a consequence of the
strong solvent–solute interaction. In the spectra, this can
be seen as a significant reduction in the vibrational fine structure
(see the Supporting Information).

Fluorescence
Quantum Yield Determination
In the initial
phase of the studies reported here, we compared the results obtained
using uncalibrated, factory calibrated, and experimentally calibrated
from two different fluorimeters using a Hamamatsu R928 detector. While
performing this calibration, and in our previous work, we used several
standards such as rhodamine 101, rhodamine B, and rhodamine 6G. Here,
we chose to use rhodamine 6G (ϕfl = 0.95 ± 0.015)
in absolute ethanol as the standard.33,34 The IUPAC-recommended
fluorescence quantum yield standards all have spectra on the blue
side of the ADOTA and DAOTA emissions, yet rhodamine 6G in ethanol
has the same emission maximum as ADOTA; see Figure 2.37 The reported
fluorescence quantum yields (ϕfl) for ADOTA and DAOTA
in air-saturated MeCN are 0.42 and 0.46,12−14 and the fluorescence
quantum yields determined in the present study are significantly larger
than what was previously reported; see Table 1 and the Supporting Information. In MeCN, we find average quantum yields of fluorescence over the
three derivatives of ϕfl(ADOTA) = 0.68 ± 0.04
and ϕfl(DAOTA) = 0.58 ± 0.03. We assume that
this discrepancy between our present data and published values can
be due to incorrect detector calibration in the earlier studies and
underestimation of the fluorescence quantum yield of the standards
used.12−14 The quantum efficiency of the popular R928 detector
from Hamamatsu is included in Figure 2 and drops significantly toward the higher red wavelengths.
If an incorrect detector calibration is used, this will lead to an
underestimation of the recorded emission intensity.

Excited State Kinetics
With accurate fluorescence quantum
yields ϕfl, the fluorescence lifetimes τfl can be used to calculate the radiative lifetime of S1, τ0, and thus the fluorescence rate constant kf; see eq 3. The radiative lifetimes were calculated for all six azaoxatriangulenium
derivatives in MeCN and DCM, and the results are listed in Table 1. When the fluorescence
rate constants are corrected for the refractive indices of the solvents,94 the obtained values of kf are, within our error limits, identical for all six fluorescent
dyes. Thus, the transition dipole moment responsible for the emission
must be of similar magnitude for these six fluorophores. This implies
that the rate constant describing the radiative transition is independent
of the number of donor nitrogen atoms in the triangulenium core and
the substituents on the donor nitrogens.

The observed differences
in the fluorescence quantum yields must be mainly due to differences
in the nonradiative deactivation described by the nonradiative rate
constant knr that can be calculated using eq 4; see Table 1. Although no difference in knr is observed for ADOTA and DAOTA as a function
of substituents on the aza bridges, there is a significant difference
between solvents. In MeCN, values of knr are roughly two times larger than the corresponding values found
in DCM. We propose that coupling to the solvent bath is more efficient
in MeCN, but as no difference in knr is
seen between derivatives with significantly different substituents,
a simple explanation along the “loose-bolt” principle
can be excluded.95 The high fluorescence
quantum yields (>80%) in air-saturated DCM indicate that nonradiative
processes (described by knr) are inefficient
(<20%) in the azaoxa-triangulenium dyes. When compared with common
organic fluorophores (Table 2), it is worth noting that both the radiative and the nonradiative
rate constants depopulating the first excited singlet state of the
azaoxa-triangulenium dyes are small.

e Average
values for all azaoxa-triangulenium
dyes are investigated here, and the error is estimated to be less
than 5%.

The low fluorescence
rate constant is directly related to the low
oscillator strength of the primary transition. For the nonradiative
processes contributing to the deactivation of the first-excited singlet
state S1 of the azaoxa-triangulenium dyes (embodied by knr), we must undertake a detailed analysis.

Investigating
Nonradiative Deactivation and the Influence of
Oxygen
Internal conversion and intersystem crossing can normally
be probed using transient-absorption spectroscopy and time-gated emission
spectra. However, we did not manage to record a transient absorption
spectrum, over the range 500–880 nm, that could be assigned
to a triplet state from nitrogen- and air-saturated solutions of ADOTA
and DAOTA. Furthermore, under ambient conditions in nitrogen-saturated
solutions and in frozen solution at 77 K, we did not observe any phosphorescence
using time-gated spectroscopy. Our experiments in various solvents
indicate that the previously reported phosphorescence spectrum for
trioxatriangulenium arises from a neutral leuco-adduct, not from the
cationic triangulenium dye.96 Thus, we
did not see direct evidence for the formation of a triplet state.

The triplet state of organic dyes may be monitored indirectly by
following the generation and subsequent phosphorescence of singlet
oxygen, and singlet oxygen was indeed detected following the excitation
of ADOTA and DAOTA. The amount of singlet oxygen formed can be determined
using a relative method. The singlet-oxygen quantum yields (ϕΔ) following the excitation of ADOTA and DAOTA recorded
at ambient oxygen concentrations (air-saturated) are included in Table 1. Singlet oxygen is
usually formed by energy transfer from the triplet state because this
state lives sufficiently long for oxygen to collide with the molecule.
However, for these dyes in particular, direct formation of singlet
oxygen from S1 is also a possibility, owing to the long
singlet-state lifetime.84 The singlet
excited state energy is sufficient to allow for singlet oxygen formation
directly; conversely, oxygen-mediated intersystem crossing cannot
result in the formation of singlet oxygen as the computed energy gap
between S1 and T2/T1 at ∼2000:∼5000
cm–1 is significantly smaller than ∼7900
cm–1, which is required to generate singlet oxygen.
The observed singlet oxygen emission thus points to the generation
of singlet oxygen through the T1 → S0 and/or S1 → S0 transitions.84,85

In DCM, a short rise in the singlet oxygen phosphorescence
traces
with a lifetime of roughly 1 μs could be discerned. The kinetics
of this rising portion of the signal can be associated with the decay
kinetics of the singlet oxygen precursor.44 Because this observed microsecond rise time is much longer than
the nanosecond lifetime of S1 in oxygenated solutions of
ADOTA and DAOTA, we infer that singlet oxygen is formed from the triplet
state. The quantum yields of singlet oxygen formation account for
up to 10% of the absorbed photons in air-saturated solutions; see Table 1.

The fluorescence
quantum yields and fluorescence lifetimes were
determined for all six compounds in DCM and MeCN solutions with varying
amounts of dissolved oxygen. This was achieved by investigating solutions
of the azaoxa-triangulenium dyes saturated with air, nitrogen, and
oxygen. The data can be used to investigate the nonradiative deactivation
of S1 embodied by knr, which
can be described as a sum of rate constants as done in eq 4. The nonradiative deactivation
of ADOTA and DAOTA depends on the oxygen concentration with the rate
constant kO2. It is generally
assumed that oxygen quenching of S1 produces a triplet
state. Nevertheless, the exception can indeed occur as follows: oxygen
quenching of S1 can result in internal conversion.84Table 2 shows the determined values of kO2 for ADOTA and DAOTA, along with the corresponding rate
constants for other selected organic fluorophores. Upon cursory inspection
of Table 2, it is evident
that the azaoxa-triangulenium dyes do not undergo quenching by oxygen
at the diffusion-controlled limit (kdiff ≈ 1010 M–1 s–1).97 Although the observed kO2 for ADOTA and DAOTA is significantly smaller
than what is commonly observed for polyaromatic dyes, it is of the
same order of magnitude as what has been observed for a series of
acridinium and cyano-substituted dyes with electron-poor S1.83,85 Thus, our data suggest that the redox properties
of ADOTA and DAOTA are not amendable for efficient excited state interactions
with molecular oxygen.11,83,85

The data in Table 2 show that a small rate constant for nonradiative decay is
the reason
that the azaoxa-triangulenium dyes have the unique combination of
a large fluorescence quantum yield and a long emission lifetime.

Solvent Effects
Comparing MeCN and DCM (Table 1), we infer that strong coupling
to the solvent bath induces a more efficient nonradiative deactivation
as knr(MeCN) ≈ 2knr(DCM). However, the observation gives no information
regarding the mechanism of nonradiative deactivation via internal
conversion (no direct experimental evidence) or intersystem crossing
(experimentally observed via singlet oxygen kinetics with a microsecond
rise). It is clear that the pathway for nonradiative deactivation
is more efficient in DAOTA than in ADOTA. As the major difference
between the two dyes is the number of aza bridges, we suggest that
these are responsible for this difference. It has been speculated
that nitrogen atoms in the conjugated system promote intersystem crossing
via pyramidalization.98 A more efficient
pathway for intersystem crossing is consistent with the observed lower
fluorescence quantum yields for DAOTA when compared with ADOTA.

In summary, the experimental results implicate the formation of a
triplet state, demonstrate that oxygen influences the deactivation
of S1, and show that we can account for a total of ∼90%
of the absorbed photons in air-saturated DCM. Compared with other
dyes (Table 2), azaoxa-triangulenium
dyes have a low overall rate of nonradiative deactivation of the first
excited state (knr) in the air-saturated
solution and a low rate of oxygen mediated deactivation (kO2). It has to be noted that the discussion
has not included molecular quenching. If the quenching of the singlet
states of ADOTA and DAOTA occurs via photoinduced electron transfer,
the efficiency depends on the redox properties of the dyes; see ref (14).

Computational
Results
Method Benchmark
As the first step, we performed an
extended benchmark study on MeADOTA to find the computational methodology
representing the best compromise between speed of calculation and
accuracy of the results to work with triangulenium dyes. The fastest
method we tested is DFT/TD-DFT, for which we assessed three different
functionals. The CC2 method was used as an intermediate method of
proven fair accuracy but was not fast enough for extensive investigations
in contrast to the DFT methods. Finally, the MS-RASPT2 method was
used for some key calculations as it was extremely expensive in terms
of time and computational resources, although with proven accuracy.
The results of the benchmark study are reported in Table 3.

a Unless otherwise indicated, geometries

of the data to the complete basis set limit; see the Supporting Information.

b All energies were calculated with
the given methods, and a cc-pVQZ basis set with geometries was optimized
with CC2/cc-pVQZ.

c All energies
were calculated with
an ANO-RCC-PVTZ basis set, and geometries were optimized with B3LYP/cc-pVTZ.

As can be seen from the data
in Table 3, various
methods gave quite different results.
Thus, it is important to select the one that represents the best compromise.

First of all, it can be noticed that the data obtained with a fixed
geometry (CC2/cc-pVQZ) and different methods/functionals for the calculation
of the excitation energies do not differ significantly from those
obtained at geometries optimized with the corresponding methods. Therefore,
we can assume that the photophysical properties of the tested molecule
are not overly sensitive to the choice of method for geometry optimization.
Hence, for the rest of the calculations, we used B3LYP/cc-pVTZ as
the functional of choice for efficient geometry optimizations.

Second,
the values obtained from the CC2 calculations were 0.12–0.13
for the D1 diagnostic, which is larger than the maximum acceptance
of ∼0.04/0.05.99 Thus, these calculations
may not represent the optimal values to compare with but nonetheless
have to be considered because they are also close to the MS-RASPT2
computed values. The few MS-RASPT2 values reported in Table 3 were obtained after a further
internal benchmark on the method itself, regarding the number of virtual
orbitals to be included (Table S12). The
data in Table 3 were
obtained with 371 virtual orbitals. Two different active spaces including
two or three holes/excitations (PT2-2HE and PT2-3H, respectively)
were also tested. The results show that the inclusion of three holes/excitations
is not necessary for these kinds of molecules, as opposed to what
was previously found.100

Considering
both absorption and fluorescence data, we deemed the
B3LYP functional with cc-pVQZ basis set to represent the best compromise
in terms of speed for the computation of energy differences, whereas
the CAM-B3LYP functional and the same basis set were chosen for the
TDMs.

Absorption and Fluorescence Data
The calculated energies
of the first excited states in the singlet and triplet manifold are
shown in Table 4. It
is worth to note the low-energy splitting of the S1 and
S2 states and T1 and T2 states. In D3h symmetry, these states would
collapse to degenerate states spanning the x and y axes, whereas in C2v, they fall into two different irreducible representations.12 In Table 4, it can be noted that T2 is just below S1 for both ADOTA and DAOTA, suggesting viable intersystem axes. A
cursory inspection of Table 4 shows that calculated energy differences are not in very
good agreement with the experimental results. However, it is assumed
that computed energy differences for ADOTA and DAOTA are more accurate,
as they are in better agreement with the experimental data.

with the experimental
data. The error in the reported values for MeDAOTA is 800 cm–1, whereas those for MeADOTA are those inherent of the computational
method used (B3LYP/cc-pVQZ).

To examine the effect of the substituents on the nitrogen bridges,
the absorption and emission processes were investigated; see Table 5. The experimental
results did not show decisive differences between the six dyes, when
considering the excited state kinetics (Table 1). The calculations show that the aryl-substituted
dyes have a radiative rate constant 10% larger than the alkyl-substituted
derivatives and that this is most pronounced for DAOTA. More notably,
the method used overestimates the radiative rate constant by a factor
of 2. The substituent effect on the transition energy is most likely
real but vanishes under the experimental conditions used. Similarly,
the effect of substituents on the relative size of the transition
energies is reproduced but overestimated by the calculations.

b kf calculated
following refs (94) and (101); the error
is estimated to be less than 10%.

The Stokes’ shift is vastly overestimated using
the computational
method. This suggests that the structural relaxation of the excited
state is important in determining the observed emission energy and
that it must occur in both dyes. In the experimental data, the Stokes’
shift is significantly larger in DAOTA than that in ADOTA. As the
dye system is charged, the solvation is dominated by the need to compensate
for the charge. This is not affected by the electronic state of the
dye, and thus the solvation is expected to be close to identical in
the ground and the excited states. Therefore, assuming that differences
in solvation are negligible between the two cationic dyes, the experimentally
observed difference in Stokes’ shift and the origin of the
shift found by computations implies that the structural relaxation
that occurs in the excited state of DAOTA is significantly larger
than that occurs in ADOTA. The only difference between the two structures
is the substitution of an oxa bridge with an aza bridge; thus, the
increased relaxation must involve the structure around the nitrogen
atoms such as a variation between pyramidal or planar as the dominating
structure.

Closer inspection of Table 5 reveals that the transition probability
given (e.g. as the
oscillator strength) is reduced by 30% for light emission as compared
with light absorption. By scrutinizing the data, it can be seen that
this is due to the structural relaxation in S1: the relaxation
reduces the Franck–Condon overlap with the ground state, reducing
the transition probability. The phenomenon is most likely overestimated
by the model, which gives rise to an overestimation of both the reduction
in oscillator strength and the Stokes’ shift. As the reduced
coupling between S1 and S0 still results in
an overestimation of kf, and thus the
transition probability, the computational results does not offer an
explanation for the low rate constant observed for internal conversion
in the azaoxa-triangulenium dyes. The theoretical data do suggest
increased structural relaxation as an explanation for the difference
in the excited state kinetics between ADOTA and DAOTA. Electron density
difference maps are included in Table 5; it has to be noted that all transitions occur with
an increased electron density on the central carbon and that the plots
confirm the experimentally assigned symmetries; see ref (12).

Excited State
Energy
The discussion so far has been
focused on comparing the theory and experiment and understanding the
excited state kinetics. The small differences in energy discussed
here do not appear to influence the excited state kinetics; see Table 1.

Figure 3 shows the spectra of all six
investigated dyes in the DCM solution. For ADOTA, the difference in
the substituent on the single nitrogen bridge moves the energy of
the first excited state up to 200 cm–1, whereas
the same number for DAOTA is 330 cm–1 for two nitrogen
substituents. In ADOTA, the effect is larger for the relaxed excited
state compared with the Franck–Condon state; for DAOTA, there
is no difference. The Stokes’ shift increases for PhADOTA to
360 from 270 cm–1 in MeADOTA and PrADOTA. This indicates
a more pronounced structural change in the S1 state for
the aryl-substituted ADOTA as compared with the alkyl-substituted
derivatives.

Figure 3 Comparison of substituent effects in the fluorescence
excitation
(black) and emission (red) spectra for the six investigated azaoxa-triangulenium
dyes in DCM.

The average Stokes’
shift for DAOTA is 571 cm–1, which is significantly
larger than that for ADOTA. In DAOTA, the
Stokes’ shift is not influenced by the substituent on the nitrogen
bridges, although the overall larger Stokes’ shift may dominate
the substituent effect. The larger Stokes’ shift observed for
DAOTA may be linked to the faster rate of internal conversion found
for this dye system, when retaining the assumption that the occurrence
of structural reorganization is linked to the pathway of nonradiative
deactivation.

Experimental and computational results agree on
the energy difference
when comparing the optical transitions in ADOTA and DAOTA and that
the energy difference depends on the substituents on nitrogen. For
absorption (the Franck–Condon state), the energy difference
between ADOTA and DAOTA is 380, 490, and 600 cm–1 for methyl, propyl, and phenyl, whereas the difference in fluorescence
(the relaxed S1 state) is more pronounced with values at
690, 750, and 830 cm–1. Exclusively considering
the energy gap law, the energy difference will give rise to a 10%
larger rate constant for internal conversion in DAOTA compared with
ADOTA, in the most extreme case. The observed difference
in knr in DCM is 30% (Table 1), thus confirming that factors
other than excited state energy must be determining the photophysical
behavior observed for the azaoxa-triangulenium dyes.

Taken together,
the computational results and the detailed energetic
analysis bear out a small difference between ADOTA and DAOTA related
to the relaxation of the excited state structure of the dyes. The
small difference in structural relaxation, determined by the number
of nitrogen donors in the fluorophore, may be the origin of the higher knr observed for DAOTA.

Conclusions
The photophysical properties of six azaoxa-triangulenium dyes were
investigated in a series of steady-state and time-resolved spectroscopies.
Corrected fluorescence quantum yields were reported for ADOTA and
DAOTA. It was found that solvent effects smoothen the vibrational
fine structure in the absorption and emission spectra and influence
the rate of nonradiative deactivation of S1, whereas the
refractive index-corrected fluorescence rate constant was found to
be independent of solvent. It was found that the substituents on the
aza bridges influence the transition energy slightly but do not alter
the rate of radiative or nonradiative deactivation of S1. Molecular oxygen was found to influence the excited state kinetics
of S1, and we propose that, to an appreciable extent, nonradiative
deactivation in the azaoxa-triangulenium dyes occurs via intersystem
crossing to the triplet manifold and subsequent quenching of T1 by molecular oxygen. However, direct quenching of S1 by molecular oxygen is also a possibility owing to the comparatively
long singlet-state lifetime.

It was shown that B3LYP/cc-pVQZ
energies and CAM-B3LYP/cc-pVQZ
TDMs on B3LYP/cc-pVTZ geometries can be used to calculate the excited
state properties of triangulenium dyes but that this level of theory
still struggles to describe delicate balances of forces involving
space interaction. Although the experimental results did not find
any optical transitions from the triplet manifold of ADOTA and DAOTA,
the computational results show that these should be observable in
the energy ranges investigated. We must conclude that the radiative
processes in triplet manifold of these azaoxa-triangulenium dyes have
very low transition probabilities.

The results presented here
allow the conclusion that the azaoxa-triangulenium
dyes have a very low inherent rate of nonradiative deactivation from
S1, which in part is due to a low rate constant for quenching
by molecular oxygen. Therefore, ADOTA and DAOTA are fluorophores with
strong emission in the red, long fluorescence lifetimes, and high
photostability that open new possibilities in the areas of fluorescence
technology and bioimaging.
