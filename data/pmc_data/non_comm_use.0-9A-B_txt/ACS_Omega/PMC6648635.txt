Injectable hydrogels
based on synthetic peptides have shown great
promise in many biomedical applications. Yet, the high cost generally
associated with synthetic peptides hinders the practical use of such
peptide-based injectable hydrogel. To overcome this drawback, here,
we propose to use the peptides from hydrolyzed low-cost natural protein
as an economical and convenient peptide source to prepare an injectable
hydrogel. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this alternative strategy
using hen egg white lysozyme (HEWL) as an example. We used the peptide
fragments from hydrolyzed HEWL as the gelator, and the magnesium ion
as the performance enhancer to prepare the injectable hydrogel. We
showed that the hydrogel is an amyloid gel as it was formed by a dense
network of amyloid fibrils. We also showed that the hydrogel possesses
a thixotropic property and displays a low cytotoxicity. The hydrolysis
extent of HEWL was found to be a critical factor that influences the
performance of the hydrogel. A fluorescence assay based on 8-anilinonaphthalene-1-sulfonic
acid was proposed as a mean to precisely and conveniently control
the hydrolysis extent of HEWL to enable the best injectability performance.
At last, using doxorubicin as a model compound, we explored the potential
of this amyloid-based hydrogel as an injectable drug carrier.

==== Body
Introduction
Hydrogels are a class
of soft materials that possess three-dimensional
networks, which can entrap a large amount of water, while maintaining
their structural integrity. Their easily tunable physical and chemical
properties have made it possible for hydrogels to be employed in many
modern engineering and technological areas.1 In particular, hydrogels with biocompatibility and biodegradability
are perfect candidates for biomedical applications including as scaffolds
in tissue engineering,2−11 as delivery vehicles for injectable therapeutics,4,12−25 as coating for implantable biomedical devices,26−28 and as bioadhesives
in surgery.29−32

Injectable hydrogel is a unique type of hydrogel for biomedical
applications. It can be easily applied to the target site through
a syringe and then undergo a rapid in situ gelation through either
chemical cross-linking or physical association. The injectable property
makes such hydrogel possess some apparent advantages over noninjectable
hydrogels. For example, when used as implantable materials, injectable
hydrogels can readily assume the shape of the cavity, thus providing
a perfect fit and contact between the hydrogel and tissue; when used
in tissue engineering and drug delivery, cells and drug molecules
can be easily incorporated into the hydrogel through simple mixing
with the hydrogel before injection.33,34 Injectable
hydrogels can be formed by diverse types of chemical and biological
systems, such as peptides and proteins, polymer blends, block copolymers,
colloids, polyelectrolytes, host–guest complex, etc.34 Among these systems, peptide-based hydrogels
have attracted great attention in recent years due to their good biocompatibility
and showed great promises in the biomedical fields.35−47

Despite these exciting progresses made by scientists in recent
years, peptide-based injectable hydrogels still suffer from high cost.
The peptides used in injectable hydrogels are usually synthetic peptides
obtained through solid-phase synthesis. It is known that peptide synthesis
can be very costly, in particular, with respect to long peptide synthesis.
To overcome this drawback, some scientists have explored to construct
an injectable hydrogel with ultrashort peptides or conjugated single
amino acid.42,47−53 For example, Mahler et al. discovered that an Fmoc-modified dipeptide,
Fmoc-diphenylalanine peptide, could easily form an injectable hydrogel
when prepared at a high concentration in aqueous solution.48 Such hydrogel was stable under a variety of
conditions including a broad range of temperatures, wide pH range,
and even under some harsh conditions such as in the presence of denaturants
and strong acid. These excellent conditions render this dipeptide-based
injectable hydrogel a wide range of potential applications.48 Baral et al. developed a synthetic tripeptide-based
hydrogel.42 The tripeptide consists of
11-aminoundecanoic acid and Phe-Phe residues. The hydrogel by such
tripeptide exhibits excellent thixotropic property and injectability.
The hydrogel were used as a delivery vehicle for the sustained release
of an antibiotic vancomycin and vitamin B12.42 Thota et al. designed a conformationally restricted dipeptide, LeuΔPhe,
containing an α,β-dehydrophenylalanine residue.47 This gelator can form a highly stable and mechanically
strong hydrogel under mild physiological aqueous conditions and shows
excellent biocompatibility and injectability. Controlled release of
several hydrophobic and hydrophilic drug molecules with this novel
hydrogel has been demonstrated. The hydrogel was further used to entrap
an antineoplastic drug to treat tumor in a mouse model.47 Besides developing low-cost synthetic ultrashort
peptides, we believe that looking for peptides from low-cost natural
sources could be an alternative way to construct a peptide-based injectable
hydrogel. To this end, we herein propose to use peptides from hydrolyzed
low-cost natural protein such as hen egg white lysozyme (HEWL) as
an economical and convenient peptide source to prepare an injectable
hydrogel. Using the peptide fragments from hydrolyzed HEWL as the
gelator, and the magnesium ion as the performance enhancer, we are
able to prepare an injectable amyloid gel. Factors that influence
the injectability of the hydrogel are investigated, and the hydrolysis
extent of HEWL was found to be the most influential. A fluorescence
assay based on 8-anilinonaphthalene-1-sulfonic acid (ANS) was proposed
as a mean to precisely and conveniently control the hydrolysis extent
of HEWL to enable the best injectability performance. At last, using
doxorubicin as a model compound, we explored the potential of this
amyloid-based hydrogel as an injectable drug carrier.

Results and Discussion
The aim of our study is to develop a low-cost injectable peptide-based
hydrogel system. In previous reported injectable hydrogels by synthetic
peptides, it is very common to see that a hydrogel is composed of
a dense network of nanofibrils by the designed peptides. This phenomenon
inspired us to search for some amyloid fibril systems by some low-cost
proteins to fulfill our goal. Amyloid fibril is a unique type of protein
and peptide aggregate with fibrillar microscopic morphology.54,55 The length of amyloid fibril can reach several microns, and the
width of amyloid fibril is in nanoscale. So, amyloid fibrils are protein-
and peptide-based nanofibrils. In vivo amyloid fibril formation can
be a devastating event and about 40 human diseases are closely linked
to the fibrillation of a particular protein or peptide.54 Despite its pathological significance, amyloid
fibril is now being considered as a promising building block for novel
nanomaterials and has shown promises in a variety of applications
such as sensing, tissue engineering, and drug delivery.56−64 In recent years, we have been working with the amyloid system by
hen egg white lysozyme (HEWL).65−67 HEWL is a very low-cost natural
protein and finds many applications in the food industry and pharmaceutics.68 It is also a widely used model system in the
amyloid research. When working with the HEWL amyloid system, we occasionally
found that the amyloid incubation solution by hydrolyzed HEWL can
form a hydrogel with some degree of thixotropic property. Namely,
when we shake the gel-like incubation solution, it can turn from a
solid gel to vicious liquid; after some resting time, it turned back
to a solid gel. As the hydrogel system with thixotropic property can
be a good candidate for an injectable hydrogel, our occasional discovery
tells us that we might be able to develop an injectable hydrogel system
based on the hydrolyzed HEWL system through some optimizations. In Figure 1, we show the general
strategy of using HEWL to construct an injectable hydrogel with low
cost and with ease. The first step is to hydrolyze HEWL under heat
and acidic conditions. This is to generate a large amount of some
highly amyloidogenic peptide fragments through selective hydrolysis
at the sites of aspartic acid residue. These fragments are then lyophilized
to give a dry powder. The obtained peptide powder is used to make
the incubation solution with suitable concentration for amyloid fibrillation.
The incubation solution also contains HCl and Mg2+. HCl
is to be used to provide an acidic environment, and the divalent Mg2+ ion is used to accelerate the amyloid formation and enhance
the gelation performance. After amyloid fibrillation, the incubation
solution is lyophilized again. This step gives the final product,
namely, the precursor material for hydrogel. The final product is
a mixture of amyloid fibrils, free peptides (i.e., the nonamyloidogenic
peptides), and MgCl2. It is ready to be used for making
the injectable hydrogel. To make the injectable hydrogel, the amyloid
fibril-containing powder is re-suspended in PB buffer. Moreover, the
PB buffer can contain drugs for drug delivery purpose. After a brief
sonication process with an ultrasonication bath, the suspension becomes
a clear colloidal solution. The colloidal solution is ready to be
used for syringe injection. In vitro testing at 37 °C shows that
such colloidal solution (either with or without drug) can form gel
rapidly, demonstrating its injectability. In addition, this hydrogel
manufacturing process also includes a quality control step. In the
following, we will provide detailed characterizations and descriptions
for each step in Figure 1.

Figure 1 Strategy of making an injectable hydrogel from hydrolyzed HEWL.

Hydrolysis of HEWL
Under acidic
condition (i.e., pH
= 2 or below), HWEL undergoes partial hydrolysis at the aspartic acid
(Asp) site.69−71 The partial hydrolysis mechanism is shown in Figure 2. The hydrolysis
can occur on either the Asp-X peptide bond (referred to as Asp-X type
hydrolysis in this work) or the X-Asp peptide bond (referred to as
X-Asp type hydrolysis in this work). HEWL has seven aspartic acid
residues as shown in its sequence in Figure 3. In principle, partial hydrolysis of HEWL
could generate a rather complex mixture of peptide fragments. Yet,
in practice, previous studies have showed that HEWL cleaves mainly
at the sites of D48, D52, and D101 through Asp-X type hydrolysis,
thus generating the 49–101, 53–101, and 1–48/102–129
fragments.70,71 The three important aspartic
acid sites have been denoted in red color in Figure 3. The 49–101 and 53–101 fragments
contain the disulfide bridges by Cys64–Cys80 and Cys76–Cys94,
respectively; the 1–48/102–129 fragment contains the
disulfide bridges by Cys6–Cys127 and Cys30–Cys115. The
49–101 and 53–101 fragments are highly amyloidogenic
and are responsible for the amyloid formation of hydrolyzed HEWL. Figure S1 shows the Maldi-TOF MS results of the
hydrolyzed HEWL in this study. The dominant MS peaks in the MS graph
around m/z = 5318 and m/z = 5678 originate from the 49–101 and 53–101
fragments and their succinimide derivatives, respectively. The 1–48/102–129
fragment peak, which is around m/z = 8619, is not very intense in the MS graph likely due to its low
Maldi-TOF response.

to be cleaved.

Amyloid Nature Characterizations
The obtained peptide
fragments were used to make the incubation solution with suitable
concentration for amyloid fibrillation. The pH of the incubation solution
was adjusted to be 2 with aqueous HCl, and MgCl2 was included
in the incubation solution to accelerate the amyloid formation and
enhance the gelation performance. The obtained fibrils were characterized
using ThT fluorescent assay, AFM, Congo red (CR) assay, and FTIR spectroscopy
to confirm its amyloid nature. The AFM characterization was presented
in Figure 4A, which
shows the formation of fibril-like peptide aggregates. These fibrils
have average heights of 3 nm. In Figure 4B, the ThT fluorescent assay result shows
the fluorescent enhancement around 480 nm under the excitation of
450 nm. ThT is a dye commonly used in the diagnostics of amyloid fibrils.
Its fluorescent enhancement at 480 nm is the typical feature of ThT-stained
amyloid fibrils.72 In Figure 4C, the CR assay result reveals
an absorption increase at about 540 nm after the CR binding onto the
obtained peptide fibrils. CR is another commonly used dye in the diagnostics
of amyloid fibrils. The appearance of 540 nm absorption of CR could
indicate the presence of amyloid structure.73Figure 4D presents
the FTIR characterization of the obtained peptide fibrils. The FTIR
spectrum of HEWL fibrils features a prominent absorption at 1628 cm–1, indicting the formation of β-sheet structure.
The basic unit of an amyloid structure consists of two longitudinally
extending β-sheets with their side chains forming a steric-zipper-like
self-complementary intersheet structure. So, the presence of β-sheet
secondary structure is an important feature of amyloid structure.54,55,65,66,74 Overall, these AFM and spectroscopic characterizations
confirm the formation of amyloid structure by the peptide fragments
from hydrolyzed HEWL. The incubation solution containing the prepared
amyloid fibrils are then lyophilized to get an amyloid fibril powder.
The powder sample will be the final product (i.e., precursor materials)
used for our quick and easy preparation of injectable hydrogel.

The final product is
a mixture containing three major species:
amyloid fibrils, nonamyloidogenic peptide fragments, and magnesium
salt. The amyloid fibrils are formed by these amyloidogenic peptides
derived from HEWL hydrolysis, namely, the 49–101 and 53–101
fragments and their derivatives. Some peptide fragments derived from
HEWL hydrolysis such as the 1–48/102–129 fragment are
nonamyloidogenic, and they are remained in the final product in the
nonamyloid fibril form. As we can see, the final product is a rather
complex mixture.

Injectable Hydrogel Preparation and TEM,
SEM, XRD, and Rheological
Characterizations
The lyophilized amyloid fibrils were dissolved
into PB buffer at pH = 7.4. After sonication, the fibril and buffer
mixture becomes a clear liquid suspension as shown in Figure 5A. Sonication step is helpful
to better disperse the fibrils in the suspension. Such suspension
is ready to be used as the injectable hydrogel. As shown in Figure 5A, the liquid suspension
can become a solid gel within 5 to 10 min when incubated at 37 °C. Figure 5B shows how the injectable
hydrogel with entrapped drug can be easily prepared. By simply mixing
lyophilized amyloid fibril, drug (the anticancer drug, doxorubicin
(Dox), is used here as an example) and PB buffer together and subject
the mixture to sonication, we can obtain the injectable hydrogel with
drug. The injectable hydrogel can be pulled out of the vial with a
syringe right after the sonication step. The injected suspension can
become a solid gel within 5 to 10 min when incubated at 37 °C.

HEWL. (B) Injectability of the hydrogel with drug entrapment.

The hydrogel was characterized
by TEM, SEM, and XRD, and the results
were included in the Supporting Information. In Figure S2, the TEM image shows the
presence of fibrillar aggregates in the hydrogel. The width of the
fibril by TEM is about 18 nm. In Figure S3, the SEM image of the lyophilized hydrogel powder is shown. In Figure S4, the XRD analysis of the lyophilized
hydrogel powder is shown. The XRD profile displays a sharp band at
∼4.7 Å and a broad band at ∼8 Å. The two bands
correspond to the interstrand spacing and the intersheet spacing of
the cross-β structure in the amyloid fibril, respectively.

We found that the above-prepared hydrogel possesses a thixotropic
property. With current protocol, the hydrogel after vigorously shaking
can become liquid suspension; the liquid suspension can then become
gel again after 5–10 min resting time at 37 °C as demonstrated
in Figure S5 in the Supporting Information.
Thixotropic hydrogel is a mechano-responsive gel, which turns from
“solid-like” gel state to “liquid-like”
sol state through mechanical shaking, and returns to its original
gel state upon the removal of external stress. This property allows
us to easily maintain the fluid state of the prepared hydrogel through
simple vortex or shaking before we transfer the hydrogel into the
syringe. This means that if for some reason, we need to wait for more
time before using the syringe pulling the liquid suspension out of
the vial, we can always let the suspension be subjected to vortex
or shaking for a short duration of time to break any preformed gel
in the vial during the waiting time. Therefore, the thixotropic property
further eases the practical use of our injectable hydrogel.

The rheological properties of the injectable hydrogel were further
characterized with a frequency sweep analysis and a step-strain time-dependent
analysis. The results were presented in Figures 6 and 7. The frequency sweep results in Figure 6 give the storage
modulus (G′) and loss modulus (G″). Figure 6 was taken on the hydrogel
prepared according to Figure 1. These measurements were carried out as a function of angular
frequency by keeping a strain constant at 0.1%. The storage modulus
for our hydrogel is in the order of 103. This value is
similar to some reported self-assembling peptide hydrogels.75,76 The storage modulus (G′) and the loss modulus (G″)
represent the elastic portion and the viscous portion of the viscoelastic
behavior of the sample, respectively. Intuitively, G′ describes
the solid-state behavior of the sample, while G″ describes
the liquid-state behavior of the sample. A solid-state sample such
as a gel will have its G′ > G″, and a liquid sample
such as a sol will have its G′ < G″. In Figure 6, we have G′
> G″. This indicates the formation of a solid state, that
is,
a gel. In the step-strain time-dependent rheological analysis in Figure 7, we varied the strain
experienced by the hydrogel to see how the relationship of G′
and G″ change with strain and time. We performed this analysis
with a procedure similar to the one use in previous work by Baral
et al.42 We first kept the hydrogel under
a low constant strain of 0.1% for the first 200 s, and then the gel
was suddenly subjected to a higher strain of 40%, and this strain
was maintained for about 150 s. As shown in Figure 7, with 40% strain, we had G′ <
G″, suggesting the disruption of the hydrogel and the formation
of a sol. After about 150 s, the strain was suddenly further increased
to a constant strain of 800% and was then maintained for another 200
s. As shown in Figure 7, we still had G′ < G″ during this operation. After
this step, the strain was suddenly decreased to a constant strain
of 0.1%, and we had an almost instantaneous recovery for G′
and G″. The step-strain time-dependent experiments thus demonstrate
the good thixotropic property of our hydrogel. In the Supporting Information, we have included additional
tests to further support our argument. These tests include two step-strain
time-dependent experiments involving 100% strain (Figure S6) and 200% strain (Figure S7) and one strain sweep experiment result (Figure S8). Figure S9 shows the bar graph
of selected points in Figure S8 and Table S1 presented the corresponding data.

the hydrogel with 3% (w/v)
(i.e., 30 mg/mL) HEWL concentration at a constant strain of 0.1%.

Cytotoxicity of the Injectable
Hydrogel
To examine
the cytotoxicity of the hydrogel, we have performed a cytotoxicity
study of the gel using L929 cell as a model system. The CCK-8 assay
was employed to quantify the cell viability. As shown in Figure 8, the hydrogel shows
a low cytotoxicity as compared with the negative (the “control”
columns) and positive controls (the “DMSO” columns).
In addition, the low cytotoxicity of the hydrogel is comparable to
a commercial cell culturing product, VTN-N, which is used in stem
cell research.

gel extracts.

Drug Release from Hydrogel
The three dimensional structure
of the hydrogel provide an excellent cage-like environment for the
entrapment of small molecular drug. Moreover, the injectability of
the hydrogel significantly eases the loading of drug into the hydrogel.
In the following, we will use doxorubicin as a model compound to show
the potential of the as-prepared hydrogel as a drug carrier. Dox is
a chemotherapy medication commonly used to treat the cancers of the
bladder, breast, stomach, lung, ovaries, thyroid, and others, as well
as leukemia and Hodgkin’s lymphoma. We now show that drug loading
with 100% capacity can be achieved with a simple mixing step with
our hydrogel system. We dissolved 30 mg of amyloid fibril powder into
0.5 mL of PB buffer to make a fibril suspension and dissolved a known
amount of Dox (i.e., 0.2 mg, 0.4 mg, and 0.8 mg) into 0.5 mL of PB
buffer to make a drug solution. The suspension and drug solution were
mixed together and then subjected to sonication. The obtained clear
suspension with drug loading is the injectable hydrogel ready to use.
With such protocol, 100% loading capacity could be achieved. In the
following, we further performed an in vitro drug release test of the
hydrogel loaded with Dox. One milliliter of the above injectable hydrogel
loaded with Dox was put into a glass vial and incubated at 37 °C.
Gelation occurred rapidly within 5–10 min. One milliliter of
PB buffer was added on the surface of the hydrogel. Dox released from
the hydrogel will diffuse into the PB buffer layer. At selected time
points, 0.5 mL of PB buffer was sucked out by a pipette and then a
fresh 0.5 mL of PB buffer was added into the glass vial to maintain
a constant volume of PB buffer. The Dox concentration in the withdrawn
solution was measured with UV–vis spectroscopy at 490 nm, which
is a characteristic absorption band of Dox and is away from the peptide
absorption, as shown in Figure S10. The
cumulative release curves of the loaded Dox at three different concentrations
are shown in Figure 9. The three curves showed similar release profiles: the drugs released
gradually over a period of 12 h. At the three concentrations, the
accumulating released percentages of Dox in the drug-loaded hydrogels
can all reach ∼50% or above. We also found that after a longer
period of time (e.g., about 130 h), the drug-loaded hydrogel began
to lose its integrity and diffused into the PB buffer.

of Dox entrapped in the hydrogel in PB buffer with pH = 7.4 at 37
°C.

ANS Assay as a Quality
Control Approach
Reproducible
hydrogel performance is critically important if the proposed hydrogel
can eventually be commercialized or go to clinics. Therefore, a quality
control step is an indispensable step during hydrogel production,
as we have indicated in Figure 1. As for the protocols of making the injectable hydrogels,
we have tested numerous combinations of several important factors
that influence the hydrogel performance, including protein concentration,
hydrolysis extent (or hydrolysis time), Mg2+ ion concentration,
and amyloid fibril incubation time. The current protocol gives the
hydrogel performance desired for this work. Namely, gelation can occur
in a short time (i.e., 5 to 10 min), and hydrogel possesses a good
thixotropic property. Among these factors, we found that the hydrolysis
extent is a very influential factor that needs to be properly controlled.
By adjusting the hydrolysis extent, we can adjust the gelation time
and the drug release rate. For example, a shorter hydrolysis time
can lead to a very long gelation time; a longer hydrolysis time can
lead to a very slow drug release. However, we also found that the
hydrolysis extent of the protein cannot be simply controlled by controlling
an accurate hydrolysis time. Even we keep the hydrolysis time constant,
the hydrolysis extent may vary to some extent from batch to batch.
It is thus desired to have a better way to monitor the hydrolysis
extent. We propose to use an ANS assay to monitor the hydrolysis extent.
ANS is a widely used fluorescent probe in the field of protein science,
and its fluorescence increases as it binds to hydrophobic residues
of a protein.77,78 When HWEL is hydrolyzed, the
hydrophobic residues buried within HEWL interior will be exposed.
With the progress of hydrolysis, more hydrophobic residues will be
exposed. Because the fluorescence response of ANS is very sensitive
to the presence of exposed hydrophobic residues, it can be used as
an indicator for the hydrolysis extent. Figure 10 shows the ANS fluorescence change over
time during hydrolysis. As we can see, ANS increases its fluorescence
intensity over time (refer to the curves corresponding to 24 and 48
h) and then decreased (refer to the curves corresponding to 96, 120,
and 144 h). ANS intensity reaches the highest (about 1800) at 72 h.
We found when the ANS intensity reaches in between 1800 and 2000,
the as-prepared hydrogel showed the desired performance in this work.
ANS assay thus can be a convenient quality control step for a reproducible
hydrogel performance during production.

hydrolysis of HEWL.

Hypothesis on the Formation
Mechanism of Amyloid-Based Hydrogel
The formation of a self-assembled
hydrogel requires various noncovalent
interactions during gelation.79 These noncovalent
interactions include hydrogen bonding, π–π stacking,
electrostatic, hydrophobic, and van der Waals interactions.79,80 The lysozyme amyloid fibrils used to form the hydrogel in this work
possess two properties, which could facilitate the establishment of
these different types of noncovalent interactions during gelation.
First, lysozyme consists of diverse types of amino acid residues such
as aromatic residues, basic residues, and hydrophobic residues. The
side chains of these residues could be utilized during the formation
of these noncovalent interactions. Second, the amyloid fibril formed
by a longer peptide or a protein (such as the lysozyme amyloid fibril
here) usually has a “millipede-like” morphology.81,82 Namely, the amyloid fibril looks like a millipede with a compact
β-sheet central region being the main “body” and
disordered peripheral regions being the short “legs”.
The residues in the disordered regions of the amyloid fibril can easily
change their spatial orientations due to their flexible nature and
help amyloid fibrils to establish noncovalent interactions with each
other during gelation. In addition, Mg2+ ions and the other
nonamyloidogenic peptides should also play some roles in the establishment
of noncovalent interactions.

Conclusions
In
this work, we have demonstrated that an injectable peptide-based
hydrogel can be easily prepared from a very low-cost natural protein,
hen egg white lysozyme. The hydrogel utilizes the peptide fragments
from hydrolyzed HEWL as the gelator, and the magnesium ion as the
performance enhancer and is composed of a dense network of amyloid
fibrils. The hydrogel possesses a thixotropic property and displays
a low cytotoxicity. A fluorescence assay based on the dye of ANS was
proposed as a convenient approach for quality control for a reproducible
hydrogel performance. Using doxorubicin as a model compound, we explored
the potential of this hydrogel as an injectable drug carrier.

Experimental

Hen egg white lysozyme (HEWL) (L6876) was
purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Saint Louis, USA). Thioflavin T (ThT)
of ultrapure grade was purchased from AnaSpec (Fremont, USA). Congo
red (CR) with >85% purity was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Saint
Louis, USA). Potassium phosphate dibasic with >99% purity, potassium
phosphate monobasic with >99% purity, and magnesium chloride (MgCl2) with 99% purity were purchased from Aladdin (Shanghai, China).
8-Anilinonaphthalene-1-sulfonic acid (ANS) with 95% purity was purchased
from TCI (Tokyo, Japan). Doxorubicin hydrochloride with 99% purity
was purchased from a local vendor. Deionized water with a resistivity
of 18.2 MΩ·cm was obtained from a Millipore system (Billerica,
USA).

Injectable Hydrogel Preparation
The injectable hydrogel
was prepared through the following protocols: (1) HEWL was dissolved
in (pH = 2) aqueous solution at a concentration of 30 mg/mL. The solution
was filtered through a 0.22 μm filter. The filtered solution
was transferred into a glass vial and heated at 65 °C for about
3 days. During the incubation, hydrolysis of HEWL occurred, which
generated peptide fragments. The exact stopping time point of the
hydrolysis incubation was determined using an ANS assay that will
be discussed later. The incubation solution containing peptide fragments
was lyophilized to get a dried peptide powder. (2) The peptide powder
was dissolved into (pH = 2) an HCl solution at a 30 mg/mL concentration,
and 200 mM MgCl2 was added into the peptide solution. The
mixture solution was incubated at 65 °C for 5 days. This incubation
process will generate peptide amyloid fibrils. The incubation solution
was lyophilized to get a peptide fibril powder. This powder will be
the precursor materials to make injectable hydrogel. (3) To make injectable
hydrogel for practical use, we can simply mix the peptide fibril powder
with pH = 7.3 PB buffer at a concentration of 30 mg/mL. The mixture
is then subjected to ultrasonication for 20 min. The mixture is initially
a liquid suspension and is suitable to be used as an injectable hydrogel.
The liquid suspension will be solidified to become hydrogel in 5–10
min when incubated at 37 °C. To encapsulate drugs within the
hydrogel, the drug can be added into the hydrogel by mixing the liquid
suspension with drug solution.

MALDI-TOF MS experiments
were performed by a Bruker Ultraextreme MALDI-TOF/TOF mass spectrometer
(Bremen, Germany). α-Cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (CHCA) was

in 1:1 H2O–acetonitrile solution with 0.1% TFA at
a concentration of 5 mg/mL; the hydrolyzed HEWL powder was dissolved
in water with 0.1% TFA at a concentration of 2 mg/mL. The two solutions
were mixed together with 1:1 volume ratio (i.e., 1 μL:1 μL)
and dropped onto the MALDI plate. The air-dried spot was subjected
for MS analysis with an ion source voltage of 20 kV, a laser repetition
frequency of 2000, and in a positive-ion linear mode. Each point was
collected using 1000 laser shots. Data acquisition and analysis were
performed with Bruker FlexControl 3.4 and FlexAnalysis 3.4 software.
The instrument was calibrated with protein calibration standards with
a molecular weight from 5000 to 20,000 Da before MS measurement.

AFM Measurement
All AFM images were taken on dried
samples on mica in air with a NT-MDT Solver P47 scanning probe microscope
(Zelenograd, Russia) using tapping mode. A 100 μm × 100
μm scanner was used throughout the AFM experiment. The cantilever
from NT-MDT has a resonance frequency of ∼100 kHz and a nominal
force constant of ∼3 N/m. The AFM mica sample was prepared
according to the following protocols: the hydrogel was shaken to become
liquid, and 10 μL of such hydrogel solution was diluted 100
times with deionized water and dropped onto freshly cleaved mica;
after 30 s of waiting time, the solution on top of the mica was rinsed
off; the mica was then dried in air at 37 °C. The dried mica
surface was subjected to AFM characterization. The obtained AFM images
were analyzed by NT-MDT software, NOVA.

ThT Assay
The
assay was performed with a Hitachi F-7000
fluorescence spectrophotometer (Tokyo, Japan). An excitation wavelength
of 450 nm with a slit width of 5 nm was used. The emission spectrum
in the region of 460–600 nm was measured using a slit width
of 10 nm. The concentration of ThT solution was 10 μM. The PB
buffer was 10 mM at pH = 7.4. The assay was performed ex situ. For
each measurement, the hydrogel was shaken first to become liquid,
and 10 μL of such hydrogel solution was added into 1 mL of ThT
solution in a 1.0 cm quartz cuvette for fluorescence measurement.

CR Assay
The assay was performed with an Implen UV–vis
nanophotometer (München, Germany). The concentration of CR
solution was 5 μM. The PB buffer was 10 mM at pH = 7.4. The
assay was performed ex situ. For each measurement, the hydrogel was
shaken first to become liquid and 10 μL of such hydrogel solution
was added into 1 mL of CR solution in a 1.0 cm quartz cuvette for
UV–vis measurement.

FTIR Measurement
The FTIR measurement
was performed
with a Bruker Vertex 70 FTIR spectrometer (Ettlingen, Germany) equipped
with a DLaTGS detector. The hydrogel was spread onto a CaF2 window and dried in air. The CaF2 with dried hydrogel
was then subjected to FTIR measurement. The spectral acquisition parameters
are: 4 cm–1 resolution, 32 scans, and a zero-filling
factor of 2. The obtained spectrum was further smoothed with a 13-point
window size using Savitzky–Golay algorithm to remove spectral
noise and atmospheric water vapor interference. Smoothing was performed
with Bruker OPUS software (version 7.2).

Transmission Electron Microscopy
(TEM)
TEM characterization
was performed utilizing an FEI Tecnai G2 F20 S-TWIN transmission electron
microscope (Hillsboro, Oregon) operating at 200 kV. The TEM sample
was prepared according to the following protocol. The gel sample was
first diluted by 200 times with deionized water. A 200 mesh copper
grid with a Formvar/carbon film was dipped into the diluted gel solution
for 2 s and then put on a piece of filter paper. Ten microliters of
1% (w/v) phosphotungstic acid solution was used to stain the sample
on the copper grid. The copper grid was finally air dried.

Scanning
Electron Microscopy (SEM)
The SEM characterization
of the lyophilized hydrogel sample was performed using a JEOL JSM-7500
field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM) (Tokyo, Japan)
operating at 10 kV. The sample was coated with Au for observations.

X-Ray Powder Diffraction (XRD)
XRD analysis was performed
on a Bruker D8 advance X-ray diffractometer (Karlsruhe, Germany) using
a Cu Kα radiation source. The operating conditions were λ
= 1.5406 Å, voltage = 40 kV, and current = 30 mA. The lyophilized
gel powder sample was loaded onto a sample plate, and the sample was
analyzed for 5 h. The d-spacing were determined using Bragg’s
law of diffraction.

Rheological Analysis
The rheology
experiment was performed
by using a TA AR2000EX rheometer (New Castle, USA). The storage modulus
(G′), loss modulus (G″), and the modulus of complex
viscosity of the 3% (w/v) hydrogel were measured. The rheological
experiments were performed at room temperature of about 20 °C
in plate–plate geometry with a 20 mm plate diameter.

ANS Assay
The assay was performed with a Hitachi F-7000
fluorescence spectrophotometer (Tokyo, Japan). An excitation wavelength
of 380 nm with a slit width of 5 nm was used. The emission spectrum
in the region of 420–580 nm was measured using a slit width
of 10 nm. The concentration of ANS solution was 20 μM. The PB
buffer was 10 mM at pH = 7.4. The assay was performed ex situ. For
each measurement, 2.5 μL of hydrolyzed HEWL solution was added
into 1 mL of ANS solution in a 1.0 cm quartz cuvette. The solution
in the cuvette was shaken first before each spectral acquisition.

Cell Cytotoxicity
Gel extract was applied to examine
the cytotoxicity of the lysozyme hydrogel using L929 cell according
to a published method with some modifications.83 Briefly, 0.5 mL of hydrogel with a 30 mg/mL concentration
was incubated at 37 °C in 2 mL of 1640 medium for 24 h to obtain
a gel extract. L929 cells were seeded onto a 96-well plate with a
suspension volume of 100 μL and a cell density of 2 × 104/mL per well. The culture medium is RPMI 1640 medium with
10% FBS. The cells were incubated at 37 °C in a balanced air
humidified incubator with an atmosphere of 5% CO2. After
incubation of the cells for 24 h, the culture media were replaced
by 100 μL of RPMI 1640 medium (with 10% FBS) containing gel
extracts, or fresh RPMI 1640 medium (with 10% FBS) (negative control),
or RPMI 1640 medium with 5% DMSO (with 10% FBS) (positive control).
In addition, the extract from a commercial cell culture system, vitronectin
(VTN-N), was used as an additional control. VTN-N is a recombinant
human protein that provides a defined surface for the culture of human
pluripotent stem cells. The cells in the above four types of culture
media were allowed to be further incubated for 24 and 48 h and were
then subjected to CCK-8 assay. The CCK-8 assay is an alternative cytotoxicity
evaluation assay more sensitive than the common MTT assay.
