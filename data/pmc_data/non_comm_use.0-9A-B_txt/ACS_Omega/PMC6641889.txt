The iminodisulfonate, [N(SO3)2]3–, and phosphinodisulfonate, [P(SO3)2]3–, ions have been investigated
by performing ab initio MP2/6-311+G**
calculations. The nitrogen and phosphorus atoms as part of the ions
are shown to be divalent with a negative charge and two lone pairs
on the nitrogen and phosphorus atoms. The experimentally known calcium
sodium iminodisulfonate trihydrate and the analogous unknown compound
calcium sodium phosphinodisulfonate trihydrate have also been investigated
using the MP2/6-311+G** calculations. For the nitrogen compound, only
minor changes occur in the iminodisulfonate ion when it becomes part
of the calcium sodium iminodisulfonate trihydrate. For the phosphorus
compound, the geometry of the phosphinodisulfonate ion changes significantly
as part of calcium sodium phosphinodisulfonate trihydrate. Furthermore,
the charges associated with the atoms in calcium sodium phosphinodisulfonate
trihydrate are quite different from those of the phosphinodisulfonate
ion. For calcium sodium iminodisulfonate trihydrate, the Raman spectrum
has been measured, and it compares well with the spectrum derived
using HF/6-311+G** calculations.

1 Introduction
At the Enstedvaerk power
plant, Aabenraa, Denmark, some insoluble
crystals were discovered in the water pipelines of the flue gas cleaning
systems removing sulfur dioxide. In 2002, Fogh et al. carried out
X-ray diffraction investigations of these crystals, and the crystalline
compound was identified as calcium sodium iminodisulfonate trihydrate,
CaNa[N(SO3)2]·3H2O.1 In 2003, Rasmussen et al.2 published powder diffraction data for the same compound.

The
[N(SO3)2]3– and [NH(SO3)2]2– anions have been prepared
in combination with cations potassium, sodium, and calcium by several
groups.3−7 Calcium sodium iminodisulfonate was first prepared in 1892 by Divers
and Haga, as described in their study on imidosulphonates where they
suggested the name imidosulphonate.5 In
1896, Divers and Haga published a comprehensive review of a previous
work on several imidosulphonate salts.6

In 1956, Jeffrey and Jones analyzed the crystal structure
of the
potassium salt of the aminodisulphonate ion, [NH(SO3)2]2–, by X-ray diffraction.8 The focus was on measuring the S–N bond length and
establishing the configuration of nitrogen. They determined the S–N
bond length to be 1.655 Å, which they interpreted as a partial
double bond between S and a sp2-hybridized N atom. In addition,
Cruickshank9 has also suggested that S–N
has a π bond character. Cruickshank and Jones10 refined the crystal structure of potassium iminodisulphonate
based on the data from Jeffrey and Jones.8 Their results essentially confirmed the results obtained by Jeffrey
and Jones.8 Hodgson et al.11 tried to locate the hydrogen in [NH(SO3)2]2– and to establish the configuration around
the nitrogen atom by neutron diffraction. The structure was refined
to give 4-fold bonding to two sulfur atoms. Furthermore, the structure
was refined with two half hydrogen atoms about the twofold axis; therefore,
they rejected trigonal bonding for nitrogen. Barbier et al.12 carried out X-ray diffraction studies of K3[N(SO3)2]·H2O and K2[NH(SO3)2]. Their results for [NH(SO3)2]2– confirmed the structure
obtained by Cruickshank and Jones10 and
by Hodgson et al.11 Barbier et al.12 also determined the mean bond length between
N and S in K2[N(SO3)2]·H2O to be 1.606 ± 0.002 Å and the mean bond angle
S–N–S to be 120.83 ± 0.11°. Hall et al.13 supplemented their X-ray diffraction measurements
of K3[N(SO3)2]·H2O with IR and Raman spectroscopy. They observed that the S–N
bond lengths in [N(SO3)2]3–, 1.609 ± 0.002 Å, are markedly shorter than those of the
S–N bonds in compounds containing [NH(SO3)2]2–.

In the present work, the [N(SO3)2]3– ion is investigated by carrying
out ab initio Hartree–Fock
(HF) calculations in the Roothaan formalism14 and also by performing second-order Møller–Plesset (MP2)15 calculations. In addition, the analogous phosphinodisulfonate
ion, [P(SO3)2]3–, is also
investigated by performing HF and MP2 calculations. The initial structure
of [N(SO3)2]3– is based upon
the structure obtained by Fogh et al.1 The
geometry of the investigated ions was optimized using MP2/6-311+G**
calculations, and the results elucidate the bonding properties of
the ions. Furthermore, the electrostatic charges associated with the
atoms in [N(SO3)2]3– and [P(SO3)2]3– were determined on the
basis of the optimized structures, and the results are compared with
the standard Lewis structures of the ions.

In addition, ab initio
MP2/6-311+G** studies were performed on
calcium sodium iminodisulfonate trihydrate and for the analogous calcium
sodium phosphinodisulfonate trihydrate. The bond lengths and angles
determined by the ab initio calculations are compared to the known
experimental data. The location of hydrogen and the configuration
of nitrogen in [NH(SO3)2]2– were elucidated by the MP2/6-311+G** calculation.

The Raman
spectrum has been measured for the calcium sodium iminodisulfonate
trihydrate salt obtained from the Enstedvaerk power plant, Denmark.
In addition, Raman spectra were obtained for [N(SO3)2]3– and [P(SO3)2]3–, as well as for CaNa[N(SO3)2]·3H2O and CaNa[P(SO3)2]·3H2O at the HF/6-311+G** level. The calculated normal modes for
[N(SO3)2]3– and CaNa[N(SO3)2]·3H2O are used to assign the
experimental spectra.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Ion [NH(SO3)2]2–
The crystal structure of potassium aminodisulphonate, K2[NH(SO3)2], has been studied experimentally
by other authors.8,10,11 The S–N bond lengths range from 1.6558 to 1.674 Å.11 In refs (8−10), the location of the H atom could not be determined,
but it was suggested that the geometry around the N atom is trigonal
planar, suggesting a sp2 hybridization of nitrogen. The
results by Hodgson et al.11 and by Barbier
et al.12 indicated that the N atom is sp3-hybridized.

The geometry of [NH(SO3)2]2– has been optimized at the MP2/6-311+G**
level. The molecule was initially built with S1–N1–H1–S2
in a plane.

Figure 1 shows the
optimized structure of [NH(SO3)2]2–. The total energy for [NH(SO3)2]2– is −1300.95739 au.

Figure 1 Structure of [NH(SO3)2]2– (C1) determined at the MP2/6-311+G**
level.

The optimized structure of [NH(SO3)2]2– has C1 symmetry.
The hydrogen atom is
no longer in the plane containing S1–N1–S2, and nitrogen
can be regarded as sp3-hybridized. The structural parameters
obtained in the MP2/6-311+G** calculations for [NH(SO3)2]2– are listed in Table 1 together with the electrostatic charges
determined for each atom.

The calculated average S–N
bond length, 1.738 Å, is
larger than the experimentally determined values from refs (8, 10, 11) by a magnitude
ranging from 0.064 to 0.083 Å. The average S–O bond length,
1.478 Å, derived in the present work is larger than that from
refs (8, 10, 11) by 0.025–0.036 Å. These discrepancies are presumably
related to the exclusion of the cations in the model. The H1–N1–S1
and H1–N1–S2 angles are reasonably close to the tetrahedral
angle, 109.47°, expected for a sp3-hybridized N atom,
whereas the S1–N1–S2 angle, 127.82°, is significantly
larger than the tetrahedral angle. This is probably due to the bulky
SO3 groups. The dihedral angle O1–S1–S2–O5
is 33.27°. Thus, the results derived in the present work clearly
show that the arrangement around the N atom is not planar. The N atom
must be considered sp3-hybridized.

The molecular
orbitals for [NH(SO3)2]2– were
calculated at the HF/6-311+G** level. The highest-lying
occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) is the lone-pair orbital on nitrogen. One of
the lower-lying orbitals shows some π character between nitrogen
and sulfur. Two orbitals, HOMO(−20) and HOMO(−21), show
σ bonds between nitrogen and sulfur. The bonds between the sulfur
and oxygen atoms have both σ and π characters.

2.2 Ions [N(SO3)2]3– and
[P(SO3)2]3–
The nitrogen
and phosphorus atoms bonded to only two ligands are
unusual structures.

Figure 2 shows the Lewis structures obeying the octet rules
for ions [N(SO3)2]3– and [P(SO3)2]3–.

Figure 2 Lewis structures of [N(SO3)2]3– and [P(SO3)2]3–.

It is noted that the formal charge on nitrogen and phosphorus
is
−1, whereas that on the neighboring sulfur atoms is +2. Furthermore,
the Lewis structures indicate that both nitrogen and phosphorus are
divalent. Divalent nitrogen and phosphorus with two lone pairs are
known from organometallic coordination chemistry, and such compounds
are commonly used in the design of new ligands.16−18

The structures
of [N(SO3)2]3– and [P(SO3)2]3– were optimized
using MP2/6-311+G** calculations. The total energy for [N(SO3)2]3– is −1300.09633 au, and
for [P(SO3)2]3–, −1586.35125
au. Figure 3 shows
the optimized structures of [N(SO3)2]3– and [P(SO3)2]3–. It is noted
that the symmetry of [N(SO3)2]3– is C2, whereas that of [P(SO3)2]3– is C2v. Imposing the C2v symmetry on [N(SO3)2]3– results
in a slightly higher energy and one imaginary vibrational frequency
of 33 cm–1. Therefore, this structure is not a stable
conformation and the molecule in the C2v symmetry should
be considered as a transition state leading to the C2 geometry.

using MP2/6-311+G** calculations
for [N(SO3)2]3–and [P(SO3)2]3– are shown in Table 2.

In [N(SO3)2]3–, the S–N
bond lengths are 1.640 Å and the average S–O bond length
is 1.510 Å. For [P(SO3)2]3–, the S–P bond lengths are 2.245 Å and the average S–O
bond length is 1.507 Å. The S–N–S angle is 127.53°
for [N(SO3)2]3–, and the S–P–S
angle for [P(SO3)2]3– is 112.77°.
The dihedral angle O1–S1–S2–O5 is derived to
be 42.79° for [N(SO3)2]3– and 0.00° for [P(SO3)2]3–. This reveals that the two SO3 groups are twisted considerably
in [N(SO3)2]3–, whereas [P(SO3)2]3– retains the C2v geometry with the two SO3 groups eclipsed to one another.
This difference between the nitrogen and phosphorus compounds is presumably
due to the longer S–P bonds, 2.245 Å, relative to the
S–N bonds, 1.640 Å.

Table 3 shows the
electrostatic charges for the atoms in [N(SO3)2]3– and [P(SO3)2]3–. It is noted that the calculated electrostatic charge is −1.09e and −0.92e on nitrogen and phosphorus,
respectively. For sulfur, the electrostatic charges are +1.99e and +1.74e, respectively, for [N(SO3)2]3– and [P(SO3)2]3–. The average value of the charges on
the oxygen atoms amounts to −0.98e for [N(SO3)2]3– and −0.93e for [P(SO3)2]3–.

It is noted that the
values of the electrostatic charges are very
much in line with the formal charges presented in the Lewis structures
in Figure 2.

For [N(SO3)2]3– and [P(SO3)2]3–, the molecular orbitals
were analyzed to elucidate the bonding properties. In Figure 4, selected molecular orbitals
are shown for [N(SO3)2]3– and
[P(SO3)2]3–. The molecular
orbitals are derived using HF/6-311+G** calculations. The chosen orbitals
for both ions are the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and
the lower-lying molecular orbitals HOMO(−1), HOMO(−20),
and HOMO(−21), respectively. The HOMO orbitals are π-type
lone-pair orbitals for both ions. HOMO(−1) is a σ-type
lone-pair orbital on the nitrogen and phosphorus atoms. HOMO(−20)
and HOMO(−21) show σ bonds between the nitrogen or phosphorus
and the sulfur atoms. A closer examination of all of the valence orbitals
reveals that no π character is present between the nitrogen
and sulfur atoms. The same applies for the bonds between phosphorus
and sulfur.

Figure 4 Selected molecular orbitals for [N(SO3)2]3– (a) and [P(SO3)2]3– (b) as derived by HF/6-311+G** calculations.

Thus, the molecular orbital analyses of [N(SO3)2]3– and [P(SO3)2]3– show that both ions are characterized by two
lone
pairs of electrons on the central nitrogen and phosphorus atoms. These
lone pairs on the nitrogen and phosphorus atoms occupy the two highest-lying
molecular orbitals, HOMO and HOMO(−1). The electrostatic charges
associated with N in [N(SO3)2]3– and with P in [P(SO3)2]3– are close to −1e, whereas the sulfur atoms
in both ions have charges close to +2e. Surprisingly,
no delocalization of electrons belonging to the negatively charged
atoms is observed.

For further examination of the bond properties
between nitrogen
and sulfur or phosphorus and sulfur, SPARTAN’1419 was used to determine the rotational barrier
around the S–N and S–P bonds calculated at the MP2/6-311+G**
level. During these calculations, the dihedral angles of S1–N1–S2–O5
and S1–P1–S2–O5 were changed from 0 to 360°
in steps of 6°, while optimizing everything else. This resulted
in a rotational barrier of 2.89 kJ/mol for [N(SO3)2]3– and 9.95 kJ/mol for [P(SO3)2]3–. These barrier heights do not
indicate any significant π bonding.

In view of these results,
there is no evidence of the double-bond
character between nitrogen and sulfur in [N(SO3)2]3– and the insignificant double-bond character
between phosphorus and sulfur in [P(SO3)2]3–.

Natural bond orbital (NBO) analyses have been
carried out on both
ions. The results revealed that the S atoms are basically sp3-hybridized with little contributions from the d polarization functions.
The d contributions in all sp3 hybrids of S in [N(SO3)2]3– are 0.10. In the corresponding
[P(SO3)2]3– ion, the d orbital
contributions amount to 0.09–0.10. Thus, the NBO analyses are
consistent with single σ bonds between S and N, S and P, and
also between all S and O atoms.

Altogether, the analyses of
the molecular orbitals and of the electrostatic
charges on the atoms in the ions indicate that the Lewis structures
of [N(SO3)2]3– and [P(SO3)2]3– shown in Figure 2 provide adequate representations
of the two ions.

2.3 Compounds CaNa[N(SO3)2]·3H2O and CaNa[P(SO3)2]·3H2O
In the investigation
of the structure of CaNa[N(SO3)2]·3H2O and CaNa[P(SO3)2]·3H2O, the positioning of the cations,
calcium and sodium, are based on the crystal data derived from Fogh
et al.1 With respect to water, various
placements of the water molecules have been attempted in relation
to minimizing the total energy. The structures of CaNa[N(SO3)2]·3H2O and CaNa[P(SO3)2]·3H2O are optimized by MP2/6-311G** calculations. Figure 5 shows the resulting
structures for CaNa[N(SO3)2]·3H2O and CaNa[P(SO3)2]·3H2O. The
total energy is −2368.30795 and −2654.53101 au for CaNa[N(SO3)2]·3H2O and CaNa[P(SO3)2]·3H2O, respectively.

For CaNa[N(SO3)2]·3H2O, the
S1–N1 bond length obtained is 1.611 Å, whereas the S2–N1
bond length is slightly longer, 1.644 Å. The S–N bond
lengths in the work of Fogh et al.1 are
determined to be 1.602 and 1.604 Å, respectively, which are slightly
shorter than the calculated S–N bond lengths. The S1–O1
and S2–O5 bond lengths are derived to be 1.465 and 1.479 Å,
respectively. The average S–O bond length is 1.501 Å.
The experimentally obtained1 S1–O1
and S2–O5 bond lengths are 1.470 and 1.467 Å, respectively,
which are in reasonable agreement with the calculated values. The
remaining calculated S–O bonds are slightly longer than the
ones obtained experimentally.1 The S–N–S
angle is derived to be 120.10°, whereas the experimental value
of the S–N–S angle is 118.10°. The dihedral angleO1–S1–S2–O5
is 38.25°. Thus, the O1–S1–N1–S2–O5
atoms are far from being in plane, as was assumed in the experimental
work.1,12,13

The
present work represents the first theoretical investigations
on CaNa[P(SO3)2]·3H2O and the
[P(SO3)2]3– ion. In addition,
no experimental work has been done on these phosphorus systems.

For CaNa[P(SO3)2]·3H2O, the
calculated P1–S1 and P1–S2 bond lengths are 2.163 and
2.180 Å, respectively. These bond lengths are shorter than the
ones derived for [P(SO3)2]3–, 2.245 Å. The S1–O1 and S2–O5 bond lengths are
1.457 and 1.456 Å, respectively, which are shorter than those
of the corresponding bonds derived for [P(SO3)2]3–, 1.514 Å. The average S–O bond
length is 1.508 Å. The S–P–S angle is 96.343°,
which is remarkably smaller than that identified for [P(SO3)2]3–, 112.77°. The dihedral angle
O1–S1–S2–O5 is 49.63° for CaNa[P(SO3)2]·3H2O. This shows that [P(SO3)2]3– in the CaNa[P(SO3)2]·3H2O system no longer possesses the
C2v symmetry.

Tables 4 and 5 include the shortest
distances between the cations,
calcium and sodium, and the oxygen atoms of the anions.

For
both CaNa[N(SO3)2]·3H2O and
CaNa[P(SO3)2]·3H2O, three
hydrogen bonds are observed, similar to the results obtained in the
diffraction experiment of CaNa[N(SO3)2]·3H2O.1 The calculated structural data
obtained using MP2/6-311+G** calculations for CaNa[N(SO3)2]·3H2O resulted in overall good agreement
with the experimental data.

The Owater–Hwater···Omolecule angle in the work
by Fogh et al.1 ranges from 166 to 177°.
The Omolecule···Owater distances
range from 2.731 to 2.898 Å, and the Hwater···Omolecule distances range
from 1.79 to 2.10 Å.1 These values
compare reasonably with the calculated values. According to the definition
of Jeffrey, referenced by Steiner,20 the
hydrogen bonds in CaNa[N(SO3)2]·3H2O and CaNa[P(SO3)2]·3H2O are all of moderate strength.

Table 6 lists the
electrostatic charges derived, on basis of the structures obtained
by the MP2/6-311+G** calculations, for each of the atoms in CaNa[N(SO3)2]·3H2O and CaNa[P(SO3)2]·3H2O.

For the systems containing
nitrogen, CaNa[N(SO3)2]·3H2O
and [N(SO3)2]3–, the electrostatic
charge of nitrogen in the bare
ion, −1.09e, is numerically slightly larger
than that of nitrogen, −1.02e, in CaNa[N(SO3)2]·3H2O. The electrostatic charges
of the sulfur atoms in CaNa[N(SO3)2]·3H2O, +1.65e and +1.59e, respectively,
are remarkably smaller than those of [N(SO3)2]3–, +1.99e. For the oxygen atoms,
the most significant changes occur for O1 and O5. In CaNa[N(SO3)2]·3H2O, the charges are −0.68e and −0.73e, respectively, whereas
both of the corresponding charges in [N(SO3)2]3– are −1.01e. Thus, in
CaNa[N(SO3)2]·3H2O, relative
to [N(SO3)2]3–, the charge
is transferred from the oxygen atoms to the sulfur atoms and to the
metal atoms, whereas the charge on nitrogen is almost unchanged.

For the systems containing phosphorus, CaNa[P(SO3)2]·3H2O and [P(SO3)2]3–, there are significant changes in the electrostatic
charges. The electrostatic charge on phosphorus changes from −0.92e in [P(SO3)2]3– to −0.45e in CaNa[P(SO3)2]·3H2O. For the sulfur atoms, the electrostatic
charges in [P(SO3)2]3– are
+1.74e, and in CaNa[P(SO3)2]·3H2O, S1 and S2 have electrostatic charges of +1.22e and +1.13e, respectively. For both O1
and O5 in [P(SO3)2]3–, the
charges are −0.93e. These charges are reduced
to −0.57e and −0.50e, respectively, in CaNa[P(SO3)2]·3H2O. The charges on the remaining O atoms are numerically slightly
reduced, that is, from −0.92e to approximately
−0.80e. In CaNa[P(SO3)2]·3H2O, relative to [P(SO3)2]3–, the charge is transferred from the oxygen
atoms to the sulfur atoms and to the metal atoms, whereas the charge
on phosphorus is reduced from −0.92 to −0.45. This is
presumably because the valence electrons of phosphorus are loosely
bound relative to the valence electrons of nitrogen.

NBO analyses
have been carried out for CaNa[N(SO3)2]·3H2O and CaNa[P(SO3)2]·3H2O. For both compounds, the results revealed
that the S atoms in the S–N, S–P, and S–O σ
bonds are basically sp3-hybridized with little contributions
from the d polarization functions. The d contributions in all sp3 hybrids of S in CaNa[N(SO3)2]·3H2O are in the range of 0.09–0.12. In CaNa[P(SO3)2]·3H2O, the corresponding d orbital
contributions amount to 0.07–0.12. Thus, same as for the [N(SO3)2]3– and [P(SO3)2]3– ions, the NBO analyses are consistent with single
σ bonds between S and N, S and P, and also between all S and
O atoms.

2.4 Raman Spectra
A CaNa[N(SO3)2]·3H2O crystal was placed directly under
a microscope, and a clear spot was used for recording. The provided
crystal was brown and clear; the brown areas were assigned to impurities,
and it was proved to be important to record the spectrum through a
clear crystal area. The recorded spectrum was obtained according to
the specifications given in the Materials and Methods section. The recorded spectrum is corrected for the background and
for the N2 band at 2331 cm–1.

Figure 6 shows the experimentally
obtained and calculated spectra of CaNa[N(SO3)2]·3H2O.

Figure 6 Raman spectra of two crystals of CaNa[N(SO3)2]·3H2O, obtained at room temperature.
The spectrum
obtained with 532.15 nm excitation is shifted for ease of comparison
to the spectrum obtained with 514.5 nm excitation. The top spectrum
shows the scaled spectrum of CaNa[N(SO3)2]·3H2O, based on the HF/6-311+G** calculation and assuming Gaussian
band shapes of half-height at half-width of 16 cm–1.

The 0–1200 cm–1 range is mostly associated
with the CaNa[N(SO3)2] moiety, whereas the 3000–4000
cm–1 range is associated with the three crystal
water molecules.

Theoretical Raman spectra for CaNa[N(SO3)2]·3H2O and CaNa[P(SO3)2]·3H2O were obtained by the HF/6-311+G**
calculations using Gaussian’09.21 As suggested in the work of Merrick et al.,22 an empirical scale factor of 0.9059 was used
to correct the frequencies derived by the HF/6-311+G** calculations.
The scaled frequencies are used to assign the bands obtained in the
experimental spectra. The bending modes of the three water molecules
in the salt were calculated to be at a scaled value at around 1750
cm–1, but these modes were not observed experimentally,
probably because of weakness. Table 7 lists the derived frequencies for CaNa[N(SO3)2]·3H2O with assignments of the characteristic
peaks.

(cm–1).

The S–N and S–O stretchings associated with the [N(SO3)2]3– moiety are assigned to
the bands in the 800–1350 cm–1 range. Several
authors13,23,24 have measured
the Raman spectra of K3[N(SO3)2]·H2O. Their assignments of the symmetric S–N and S–O
stretchings at 794 and 1046 cm–1 are in good agreement
with the scaled frequencies presented in Table 7.

Figure 7 shows the
spectra derived for [P(SO3)2]3– and CaNa[P(SO3)2]·3H2O based
on the HF/6-311+G** calculations. The water bending modes in the spectrum, Figure 7b, are found between
1500 and 1750 cm–1.

frequencies derived for the [P(SO3)2]3– ion, as well as the frequencies for [P(SO3)2]3– as part of CaNa[P(SO3)2]·3H2O with assignments of the characteristic peaks.

2.5 IR Spectra
Figure 8a shows two experimental
IR absorption spectra
obtained for CaNa[N(SO3)2]·3H2O, dispersed in KBr powder and pressed under evacuation into rather
clear disks.

Figure 8 (a) IR absorption spectra of two different KBr disks containing
CaNa[N(SO3)2]·3H2O, at room
temperature. (b) Absorption spectrum calculated based on the HF/6-311+G**
results and using a Gaussian profile of half-width at half-height
of 16 cm–1. The y axis values are
obtained by calculating the percentage of the epsilon absorption values,
followed by conversion to percent transmission.

As for the Raman spectra, the range from approximately 400
to 1500
cm–1 is mostly associated with the CaNa[N(SO3)2] moiety itself and the range 1500–4000
cm–1 is mostly associated with the three molecules
of crystal water, the low modes being due to bendings, the higher
ones due to OH stretchings, the symmetric ones at lower values, and
the asymmetric ones at somewhat higher wavenumbers. The calculated
spectrum in Figure 8b is scaled by a factor of 0.9059. This spectrum corresponds rather
well with the experimentally obtained spectra for CaNa[N(SO3)2]·3H2O, even though they probably also
contain weak bands due to the occurrence of overtone and combination
transitions.

3 Conclusions
The
results of the MP2/6-311+G** calculations on [NH(SO3)2]2– show that the arrangement around
nitrogen is not planar; therefore, nitrogen must be considered to
be sp3-hybridized.

The results of MP2/6-311+G** calculations
for [N(SO3)2]3– and [P(SO3)2]3– reveal that the central
atom, that is, N or
P, is singly bonded to the S atoms in both ions. The N atom has a
negative charge of −1.09e, whereas that of
P is −0.92e. It is shown that N and P each
has two lone pairs. In addition, nitrogen and phosphorus can be considered
sp2-hybridized.

NBO analyses show that the chemical
bonds between N and S as well
as between P and S are single σ bonds and that both the S and O atoms are sp3-hybridized
with only a slight contribution from the polarization d orbitals.
All bonds between the S and O atoms are single σ bonds.

Thus, the calculated structures of both ions are consistent with
the simple Lewis structures in which the nitrogen and phosphorus atoms
are divalent, each with a negative charge and two lone pairs.

The geometry of the isolated [N(SO3)2]3– ion is not significantly different from that of the
ion in CaNa[N(SO3)2]·3H2O. The
geometry of [P(SO3)2]3– changes
significantly when the ion becomes part of CaNa[P(SO3)2]·3H2O, going from the C2v symmetry
to the C1 symmetry.

When the anions, [N(SO3)2]3– and [P(SO3)2]3–, become
part of CaNa[N(SO3)2]·3H2O and
CaNa[P(SO3)2]·3H2O, the charge
is transferred from the oxygen atoms to the sulfur atoms and to the
metal atoms. Whereas the charge on nitrogen hardly changes, the charge
on phosphorus is reduced significantly. This is presumably due to
the valence electrons of phosphorus being loosely bound relative to
the valence electrons of nitrogen.

The measured Raman and IR
spectra associated with [N(SO3)2]3– in CaNa[N(SO3)2]·3H2O have
been assigned by comparison with
the calculated spectra. The vibrational bands observed above 1500
cm–1 are mostly due to the water molecules incorporated
in the crystal structure, but other bands are also observed probably due to the
overtone and combination transitions. In addition, the characteristic
bands associated with the bare ion, [P(SO3)2]3–, and with the ion in a CaNa[P(SO3)2]·3H2O crystal have been predicted and
assigned.

4 Materials and Methods
4.1 Experimental
Methods
The CaNa[N(SO3)2]·3H2O crystals were received
directly from the Enstedvaerk power plant, Denmark. The Raman spectra
of CaNa[N(SO3)2]·3H2O were obtained
using a DILOR XY 800 mm focal length multichannel spectrometer with
microentrance, laser excitation (532.15 and 514.5 nm, 400 mW) and
cooled CCD detection. Filtration of Rayleigh scattering was done with
notch filters, and calibration was done with argon lines and Raman
lines of cyclohexane.25 Slits were set
to 500 μm corresponding to a spectral resolution of approximately
6 cm–1. The spectra were obtained by recording 12 frames
in 120 s, two times.

The spectra were not corrected for the
small changes in the instrument response versus wavenumber.

IR absorption spectra were obtained from microcrystalline samples
dispersed in KBr on a PerkinElmer 1720 Fourier transform instrument
with a liquid-nitrogen-cooled Ge-diode detector. The crystals were
intensively mixed with KBr by grinding in agate mortar and pressing
the resulting powder into disks under vacuum. The spectra were recorded
in transmission mode at 25 °C against a similar empty reference
disk. The spectral resolution was around 4 cm–1.

4.2 Computational Methods
All of the
molecules studied were initially built using SPARTAN’14.19 For all of the calculations, Gaussian’09
was used.21 To obtain adequate convergence,
the optimization criteria in all calculations performed were chosen
as tight, that is, with the maximum force less than 0.000015 au and
the maximum displacement less than 0.000060 au. The geometries of
CaNa[N(SO3)2]·3H2O and CaNa[P(SO3)2]·3H2O were optimized using restricted
MP2/6-311+G** calculations with the frozen core approximation. The
molecular geometries of [N(SO3)2]3– and [P(SO3)2]3– were optimized
imposing both C2 and C2v point group symmetries.
To ensure that the optimized energies are local minima on the potential
energy surfaces, the vibrational frequencies were derived by diagonalization
of the Hessian matrix. The optimized structures of all investigated
compounds were identified as true minima because the Hessian matrices
revealed only positive eigenvalues. Furthermore, the Raman spectra
of [N(SO3)2]3– and [P(SO3)2]3– as well as of CaNa[N(SO3)2]·3H2O and CaNa[P(SO3)2]·3H2O were calculated from the optimized
structures determined using HF/6-311+G** calculations. The resulting
frequencies were scaled by the empirical factor of 0.9059.22 For CaNa[N(SO3)2]·3H2O, compared to that from the
experimental data, the scaling consisted in multiplication of the
intensity values in Å4/AMU by 20 000, shifting
by +20 000, and putting on a guessed Gaussian profile of half-width
at half-height of 16 cm–1. For [P(SO3)2]3– and CaNa[P(SO3)2]·3H2O bands, half-height at half-width of 4
cm–1 has been assumed.

The electrostatic charges
on the atoms are defined as the partial charges associated with each
atom giving rise to an electrostatic potential map that is identical
within a chosen threshold to that derived from the wave functions.
Such electrostatic charges have been derived for all of the compounds
investigated using SPARTAN’14.19
