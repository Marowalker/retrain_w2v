Ni/ZnO was prepared
by co-precipitation and used as adsorbent for
reactive adsorption desulfurization (RADS) of dibenzothiophene. The
effect of calcination temperature, precipitate washing solvent, and
reduction temperature on the adsorption performance of Ni/ZnO was
investigated. It is observed that Ni/ZnO adsorbent calcined at 350
°C, washed with ethanol, and unreduced or reduced at low temperature
performed best. By the characterization of BET, XRD, TPR, FTIR, and
in situ XAFS, the optimal calcination temperature leads to the small
crystallite of NiO and ZnO species. Washing with ethanol enhances
the surface area of adsorbent and decreases its particle size. The
influence of reduction temperature on the RADS performance is stronger
than that of calcination temperature, which is ascribed to high-temperature
reduction that makes the adsorbent easier to sinter and form a Ni-Zn
alloy. The high RADS activity is a result of the adsorbent pretreatment
conditions, which can form small Ni and ZnO particles, and the synergism
between precursors.

1 Introduction
Recently, more and more
stringent regulations have been put into
effect to control the sulfur content in transport fuels. This has
forced refineries and researchers to develop new processes to produce
cleaner fuels. The adsorption desulfurization has thus emerged as
an alternative to replace the traditional hydrodesulfurization (HDS).
The adsorbents usually considered for adsorption desulfurization include
carbon materials,1 zeolite-based materials,2 reduced metals,3 metal
oxides,4 and microporous coordination polymers.5 Among them, Ni/ZnO adsorbent based on the reactive
adsorption desulfurization (RADS) shows excellent performance for
ultradeep desulfurization. It is an efficient alternative and is seen
as a combination of catalysis and adsorption.6−21 RADS can be conducted under milder conditions compared to the conventional
HDS, and the consumption and purity requirement of hydrogen are less.6 Employing the RADS principle, Phillips Petroleum
patented the so-called S-Zorb technology to remove the sulfur impurity
in gasoline and diesel.22 In RADS of Ni/ZnO
adsorbent, the sulfur desulfurization reaction occurs on the surficial
Ni, and at the same time, the metallic Ni is sulfided to Ni3S2, then by H2S intermediate, the sulfur in
Ni3S2 is transferred to ZnO,17 so-called autoregeneration process, where the ZnO acts
as both a sulfur acceptor and a co-catalyst.9

The preparation and pretreatment have an important influence
on
the final RADS performance of Ni/ZnO adsorbent. Comparing to impregnation,
co-precipitation can produce fine particles of NiO (Ni) and ZnO and
make good contact between nickel sulfide and ZnO. Reduction treatment
was found to be important variables for optimizing the activities,
but the reduction may lead to the low activity owing to the formation
of Ni-Zn alloy and the sinter of Ni metals.11 In our previous article,18 we have found
that the desulfurization capability of Ni/ZnO decreases apparently
when the residue content of sodium increases in the adsorbent. It
is observed that sodium is enriched on the surface of adsorbent during
calcination and reduction, leading to formation of Ni-Zn alloy and
NaZn(OH)3. Meanwhile, the Na residue increased the active
crystallite size and decreased the surface area and pore volume, as
well as weakened the interaction of Ni with ZnO. To get high activity,
the Ni/ZnO adsorbent should have a sufficient surface area and proper
interaction between ZnO and NiO (Ni), which can be achieved using
modified manufacture method, calcination, and reduction pretreatment.

Elucidating the dynamic structure change of adsorbent during pretreatment
is a key issue to understand the activation process and to develop
efficient materials.23−27 In situ technology can provide credible information, avoiding the
oxidation of high reactive metal in air. In this respect, it is imperative
to develop in situ techniques for studying the pretreatment of Ni/ZnO
adsorbent, so that the relationship of RADS performance with structures
of adsorbent can be established, facilitating the rational design
and preparation of adsorbent with satisfied activity. However, this
relationship is still not well-known for the Ni/ZnO adsorption system.

The preparation conditions directly change the composition, texture,
and structures of Ni/ZnO adsorbents, which will influence RADS performance.
Elucidation of intrinsic reason of pretreatment influence will provide
important information for the improvement of Ni/ZnO-based adsorbents.
In this work, we systematically investigated the influence of calcination
and reduction temperature (from 250 to 450 °C) and precipitate
washing solvent (deionized water and ethanol) on the RADS performances.
Structure–activity relationships of the Ni/ZnO adsorbents prepared
by co-precipitation were examined by BET, XRD, TPR, and FTIR. With
the in situ XAFS technique, the dynamic structural change of Ni/ZnO
adsorbents under real conditions is investigated in detail.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Textural Properties of
the Adsorbents
Table 1 lists the
BET surface area, pore volume, and averaged pore size of NiO/ZnO adsorbents
with various pretreatments. Co-precipitated NiO/ZnO precursors were
firstly dried (P-W) and then calcined at 250 (CW250), 350 (CW350),
and 450 °C (CW450). It can be seen that, by increasing the calcination
temperature from room temperature to 350 °C, the surface area
and pore volumes of the Ni/ZnO adsorbents increase from 63.1 m2/g and 0.20 cm3/g to 101.7 m2/g and
0.46 cm3/g, respectively. However, further increasing the
calcination temperature over 350 °C leads to the decrease of
surface area and pore volume. On the other hand, the pore size presents
the monotonically increase with the increment of calcination temperature.
With the TG experiments of precipitating precursors,18 we observed that the transformation of Ni(OH)2 and ZnCO3 to NiO and ZnO occurred at the temperature
range of 250–330 °C. Below 250 °C, the precursor
had about 10% weight loss, which is attributed to the adsorbed water.
It is postulated that the textural changes with calcination at 250,
350, and 450 °C are due to the release of adsorbed water, decomposition
of the precursor, and sinter of oxides, respectively. The decomposition
of the precursor leads to an increase of the BET surface area, pore
volume, and pore size; the sintering of oxides during calcination
leads to the decrease of the BET surface area and pore volume and
then the decrease of the number of the active sites. The calcination
at high temperature induces the shrinkage and agglomeration of adsorbent
particles and collapse of the piled pores, leading to the increase
of pore size.

and XRD Results of All Adsorbents

After one time washing of the co-precipitated precursor
with ethanol
and then drying (P-E), the surface area, pore volume, and pore size
increase. The ethanol-washed sample calcined at 350 °C (CE350)
has the same effect, when compared with the no ethanol washing counterpart
(CW350). It indicates that ethanol wash has a significant influence
on the texture of the adsorbent. The water and ethanol surface tension
is 72 and 22 dynes/cm at 25 °C, respectively; during calcination,
the strong tension of water induces serious volume shrinkage and pore
collapse. As a result, the surface area decreased. The surface tension
of ethanol was less than that of water, and this weaker tension can
keep the pore structures with less shrinkage. Zhang et al.28 reported similar results.

Table 1 also presents
the surface area, pore volume, and averaged pore size of ethanol-washed
and 350 °C calcined samples after reducing at 250 (CE350-R250),
350 (CE350-R250), and 450 °C (CE350-R250). After reducing the
adsorbent at 250 °C, the surface area, pore volume, and the size
of the Ni/ZnO adsorbent slightly decrease. The further increase in
reduction temperature induces a remarkable decrease of its surface
area and pore volume accompanied by the increase of pore size. It
is suggested that the agglomeration of Ni and ZnO occurred in reduction
process.

2.2 XRD
Figure 1 shows XRD patterns of dried P-W precursor
and the calcined adsorbents. 3Ni(OH)2·2H2O and Zn5(CO3)2(OH)6 phases
are detected in the P-W sample. But, the signal is weak, suggesting
low crystallinity.29,30 After this, P-W precursor was
calcined at 250 °C; the XRD pattern had no apparent change, suggesting
that little decomposition occurred. When the calcination temperature
increased to 350 °C, NaCl-type NiO structure is distinguishable;
in addition, wurtzite-type ZnO can be discerned. Further increasing
calcination temperature to 450 °C, the XRD peaks of NiO and ZnO
become sharper; the size of NiO and ZnO crystallite particles estimated
by the Scherrer formula shows an apparent increase (Table 1). It concluded that the P-W
calcined at 350 °C can form the oxide already while avoiding
the growth of active particle.

As also shown in Figure 1, peaks of CE350 are broader than those of CW350, suggesting
smaller crystallite particles, which is listed in Table 1. For reduced adsorbents, combined
with the TPR results, well-dispersed amorphous Ni or small Ni crystalline
size is formed for adsorbent reduced at 250 °C, because the size
of Ni crystals was below the XRD limit of detection. The diffraction
patterns of the adsorbents reduced at 350 °C show strong Ni lines,
indicating most of NiO is reduced to metal Ni. The Ni and ZnO particles
increased with the reduction temperature (Table 1). The Ni-Zn alloy is detected in the 450
°C reduced adsorbent, suggesting the reduction of ZnO.31 Ryzhikov et al.11 also reported that Ni/ZnO treated at 360 °C for 6 h under H2 results in the formation of Zn-Ni alloy.

2.3 TPR Results
TPR profiles of the pure
ZnO, pure NiO, and calcined adsorbents are shown in Figure 2 (top). The onset temperature
(To), the maximum temperature (Tm), and the quantity of hydrogen consumption
are summarized in Table 2. Almost flat TPR profiles were obtained for pure ZnO, indicating
that pure ZnO cannot be reduced. TPR profile of NiO as reference compound
shows one peak centered at 338 °C. In NiO/ZnO adsorbents calcined
at different temperatures, peaks around 430 °C belong to Ni2+, having strong interaction with the ZnO support. Calcined
NiO/ZnO adsorbents display reduction profiles well above that of the
standard bulk NiO, indicating that the NiO reduction is hindered by
strong interaction between NiO and ZnO.32−34

An increase in
the lattice parameter of the NiO phase is observed
for samples calcined at 350 °C, as presented in Figure 1; this is because ZnO dissolves
in NiO, forming NixZnyO solid solution although it cannot be detected directly
by XRD.35 However, the increase of calcination
temperature from 350 to 450 °C does not lead to any increase
in the lattice parameter of NiO, indicating that the dissolution of
the components is in the process of precipitation and not in the decomposition
of well-mixed precursors during the process of calcination. Rubinshtein
et al.36 also reported a similar observation.
As shown in Table 2, the Tm of NiO/ZnO adsorbents increases
from 412 to 445 °C, with increasing calcination temperature from
250 to 450 °C, because the adsorbent is sintered. Peaks around
600 °C in NiO/ZnO adsorbents can reasonably be attributed to
reduction of surface ZnO.33−38 As listed in Table 2, it is observed that total hydrogen consumption increases slightly
with the increase of calcining temperature up to 350 °C and then
decreases with the further increase of calcination temperature to
450 °C. The amount of hydrogen consumption below 550 °C
in NiO/ZnO adsorbents is close to the stoichiometric amount of NiO
reduction, suggesting that NiO is fully reduced below 550 °C
in the presence of 5% H2 in Ar.

2.4 IR Results
Figure 3 shows the
FTIR spectra with the calcination
treatment. Bands around 3450 and 1624 cm–1 are ascribed
to the OH stretching and HOH bending, respectively, suggesting the
existence of adsorbed water. The IR spectrum of the P-E compared to
that of the P-W shows little difference except OH band shifts to higher
frequency; this points to a possible decrease of the hydrogen-bonded
hydroxyl groups.31 The strong bands at
1518, 1385, 1043, 837, and 711 cm–1 due to the presence
of carbonate in the precursor decrease with calcination temperature,
indicating the decomposition of the carbonate. The strong band at
451 cm–1 increases with calcination temperature
from 350 to 450 °C, indicating that NiO and ZnO appear.39 These results are consistent with those of XRD;
3Ni(OH)2·2H2O and Zn5(CO3)2(OH)6 are present over the precursor
and the one calcined at 250 °C. Calcination of such precursor
above 350 °C yields NiO and ZnO.

adsorbents: (a) P-E;
(b) P-W; (c) CW250; (d) CW350; (e) CW450.

2.5 XANES Spectra
Figure 4 shows Ni K-edge XANES of 350 °C calcined
sample (the mixture of P-E and BN) reduced at 400 °C (1 MPa)
under a flow of 5% H2/95% He gas mixture as a function
of time. The pre-edge peak and white line intensities are collected
for featuring the reduction of NiO.40 Pronounced
changes occur in the white line region and in the pre-edge during
reduction. The white line intensity drops, accompanied by the pre-edge
peak intensity increasing with reduction time. A transition from NiO
to nickel metal (typical feature: shoulder at 8325 eV) can be seen.
A good indication for the progress of reduction can be obtained from
the XANES region. Note also that the NiO is not entirely reduced to
Ni metal from our experiments, showing differences compared with Ni
metal.41 These are inconsistent with XRD
results; these differences can be ascribed to variations of experimental
conditions (pure H2 and 450 °C for 300 min in XRD
vs 5% H2/95% He mixture gas and 400 °C for 230 min
in XAFS) or in the oxide samples (pure NiO/ZnO adsorbent in XRD and
the mixture of NiO/ZnO adsorbent and BN in XAFS).

Figure 4 Ni K-edge XANES of 350
°C calcined sample (the mixture of
P-E and BN) reduced at 400 °C (1 MPa) under a flow of 5% H2/95% He gas mixture from 0 to 230 min.

Quantitative analysis of phases is imperative in RADS research,
where more than one phase can exist in the active state of the adsorbent.
To point to a direct transformation from NiO to Ni or the presence
of NiOx intermediate phase during reduction,
we utilize PCA to extract quantitative information of different phases.
The time-dependent mixing phases of NiO and Ni are shown in Figure 5. The data show that
NiO and Ni are sufficient to reproduce all the XANES data adequately.
After a short induction period, Ni concentration increases at the
expense of NiO concentration. This is consistent with the pure NiO
reduction reported by Richardson et al.24 However, Rodriguez et al.23 reported
there was a longer induction period for NiO reduction. Meanwhile,
there is no induction period in some reduction experiments.25,26 This discrepancy in behavior may result from differences in experimental
conditions (temperature and H2 pressure) and the morphology
of the oxides. It is apparent that metallic Ni phase was detected
with NiO phase loss simultaneously, indicating that there is no room
for the intermediate phase.23 The induction
period is postulated to produce oxygen vacancies on the NiO surface,
which is necessary for H2 dissociation.23 At low temperatures, this induction period will be longer.
Once the Ni atoms are liberated, they will nucleate into clusters
and grow in size until large enough, initiating the dissociation of
H2, where the reduction process can be accelerated autocatalytically.24 The results suggest that NiO is reduced directly
to Ni, consistent with those reported by Rodriguez et al.23 and Richardson et al.24,27

composition and first-order fit for NiO conversion during
reduction at 400 °C (1 MPa) under a flow of 5% H2/95%
He gas mixture from 0 to 230 min.

Figure 5 also
demonstrates
the experiment result and first-order fit for NiO conversion data
at 400 °C and 1 MPa under a flow of 5% H2/95% He gas
mixture. Equation 1 is
used for the first-order fit 1  where t0 is the induction
time correction. The results present that the real conversion is deviated
from the fitted first-order kinetics at prolonged time with high conversion.
The reasons are the following: First, NiO crystallites are surrounded
by Ni metal and the formed H2O molecules have difficulty
in escaping.24 Second, ZnO strongly interacts
with Ni species, hindering the reduction of NiO.34 Richardson et al.27 reported
that NiO grains were isolated in supported adsorbents. Nickel atoms
either move out from support to nucleation sites or self-aggregate
to form small particles. More interestingly, the TPR results show
the BN will influence the reduction of NiO. As shown in Figure 2 (bottom), contrary to the
narrow peak at 419 °C of pure NiO/ZnO adsorbent, the TPR peak
of the NiO/ZnO adsorbent with BN shifts to a higher temperature of
476 °C and becomes broader, indicating that BN improves the dispersed
nickel species and the interaction between NiO and ZnO during heating
treatment.

2.6 EXAFS Analysis
The Fourier transform
Ni K-edge EXAFS spectra of the NiO/ZnO adsorbent reduced at 400 °C
(1 MPa) are shown in Figure 6. The peaks at 1.5 and 2.5 Å reduce continuously. Simultaneously,
a new peak at 2 Å appears, and the peak intensity increases with
increasing reduction time. Note that the distance scale in the Fourier
transform spectra was not corrected for the phase shift. After 0.5
Å phase shift correction, the peaks located at 1.5, 2, and 2.5
Å agree with the Ni–O in NiO, Ni–Ni in metal Ni,
and Ni–Ni in NiO coordinations.23 The EXAFS result, pointing to a direct transformation of NiO to
Ni, is consistent with the XANES result.

min.

2.7 Adsorption
Tests: Dibenzothiophene (DBT) RADS
As shown in Scheme 1, the RADS of DBT model reaction
proceeds through two ways: direct
desulfurization (DDS) of DBT produces biphenyl (BP) and hydrogenation
(HYD) process gives rise to tetrahydro- and hexahydrodibenzothiophene
first and then the final product cyclohexylbenzene (CHB). The reaction
mechanism of DBT desulfurization in RADS is similar to that of the
HDS of Co/Mo or Ni/Mo catalyst.42 In this
study, the conversion of DBT was used to measure RADS activity. DDS
pathway was monitored by the BP selectivity (SBP), and the hydrogenation pathway (HYD) was followed by the
CHB selectivity (SCHB).

Scheme 1 Reaction Path Network
for DBT RADS
The effect of calcining
temperature on the DBT conversion on the
Ni/ZnO adsorbent without reduction treatment and ethanol washing is
shown in Figure 7.
For all adsorbents, 100% DBT conversion was not obtained during the
first few hours on-stream. The RADS activity of calcined samples augments
with calcination temperature increasing from 250 to 350 °C and
significantly decreases when calcining temperature further increases
to 450 °C. The sulfur capacity at 100% DBT conversion increases
from 0.16 to 0.18 g-S/g-NiO/ZnO and then decreases to 0.06 g-S/g-NiO/ZnO;
these sulfur capacities are calculated by the difference of sulfur
contents between the feed and product (Table 3). A maximum activity was achieved over the
adsorbent calcined at 350 °C, owing to a synergism between the
decomposition of the precursor and the small crystallite size of NiO
(Ni) and ZnO species. Increasing calcination temperature results in
the increase of the precursor decomposition, which is favored for
DBT conversion; meanwhile, higher calcination temperature induced
NiO and ZnO particle sintering and BET surface area reduction, which
lead to decreased DBT conversion.

Figure 7 also plots
the selectivity to investigate the HYD and DDS pathways. It is notable
that selectivity markedly changes with the calcination temperature.
For the Ni/ZnO adsorbent calcined at 250 and 350 °C, the main
product is CHB before 25 h on-stream, indicating that the DBT RADS
takes place mainly through the HYD pathway. After 25 h, SBP increases at the expense of SCHB with time on stream increasing. For the HYD route, only
trace tetrahydro- and hexahydrodibenzothiophene were detected, suggesting
that intermediate product is transformed to CHB product rapidly. The
350 °C calcined adsorbent shows higher HYD activity than 250
°C calcined adsorbent. For the adsorbent calcined at 450 °C,
the dominant product is BP.

Figure 8 shows the
effect of precipitate washing solvent on the CDBT over the 350 °C calcined Ni/ZnO adsorbent without
reduction treatment. Compared with the adsorbent without ethanol washing
(CW350), the RADS activity enhances for ethanol washing (CE350), and
the sulfur capacity at 100% DBT conversion enhances also from 0.18
to 0.21 g-S/g-NiO/ZnO (Table 3). Washing with ethanol led to an increased surface area and
small NiO (Ni) and ZnO particles, resulting in higher RADS activity.
The SCHB and SBP are also plotted in Figure 8. The time when the entire product is CHB increases from 25
h without ethanol washing to 32 h with ethanol washing, indicating
the HYD activity increases after ethanol washing.

washing solvent on the DBT conversion (I),
CHB selectivity (II), and BP selectivity (III) over 350 °C calcined
Ni/ZnO adsorbent without reduction treatment: (a) CE350; (b) CW350.
Reaction conditions: 250 °C, 1 MPa, H2/feed = 300,
LHSV = 13 h–1.

Figure 9 shows
the CDBT over the CE350 without reduction
or with
reduction at different temperatures. The high RADS activity was observed
for unreduced adsorbent and 250 °C reduced adsorbent; the reason
is presumably the small Ni particle formation. However, 100% DBT conversion
is reached only after a few hours when the adsorbent is not reduced.
It is probably that NiO is less active than Ni in the DBT RADS and
a period of induction is necessary for the reduction of NiO/ZnO under
the RADS condition. The RADS activity decreases with increasing reduction
temperature, and S capacity at 100% CDBT decreases from 0.20 to 0.02 and then to 0 g-S/g-NiO/ZnO (Table 3). Higher reduction
temperature reduces BET surface area, increases the Ni and ZnO particle
size, and forms Ni-Zn alloy, leading to a decrease of DBT conversion.
The SCHB and SBP are also plotted in Figure 9. Comparing with the adsorbent without reduction, the HYD
activity decreases after reducing at 250 °C and significantly
decreases with a further increase in reduction temperature.

MPa, H2/feed = 300, LHSV = 13 h–1.

By comparing RADS activity and
selectivity among NiO/ZnO adsorbents
calcined at different temperatures, washed with or without ethanol,
and reduced at different temperatures, we optimized the pretreatment
conditions as 350 °C calcination temperature, ethanol washing,
and without reduction or with reduction at a low temperature of 250
°C. Adsorbent with this optimized treatment gives rise to the
highest DBT conversion and sulfur capacity with HYD route dominant.

Calcination transforms the 3Ni(OH)2·2H2O and Zn5(CO3)2(OH)6 phases
in precipitated precursor to the NiO and ZnO component. XRD shows
that this transformation is achieved between 250 and 350 °C.
By TG and TG–MS,19,20 we observed that, in
single-component precursor, ZnO or NiO was formed at about 250 or
310 °C, respectively. But, the formation of NiO/ZnO composite
needs calcination above 320 °C. Kedesdy and Drukalsky reported
that NiO does not dissolve in ZnO but ZnO can dissolve in NiO, forming
NixZnyO solid
solution.35 This solid solution transforms
to NiO and ZnO phases at higher temperature, but smaller NiO and ZnO
crystallites are formed, which is beneficial for RADS reaction. The
calcination at 350 °C is high enough for NiO/ZnO composite formation
and avoids the sintering of oxide particles, thus giving rise to the
excellent DBT RADS performance. When washing precipitated NiO/ZnO
precursor with ethanol, ethanol replaced water remains in pores. Owing
to the low surface tension of ethanol, the pore structures are retained
when ethanol is released from pores by heating.21 Thus, calcined sample with ethanol washing has the highest
surface and pore volume, leading to improved RADS activity. Pre-reduction
transforms NiO to active Ni metal. Thus, induction period can be avoided
in RADS reaction. But, the Ni-Zn alloy with low activity is formed
by hydrogen reduction.11 A study shows
that formation of Ni-Zn alloy seriously decreases RADS activity.44 The in situ reduction of NiO/ZnO avoids the
formation of Ni-Zn alloy; thus, CE-350 without pre-reduction has the
best RADS performance although a short induction period for Ni reduction
is observed. The TPR and in situ XAFS results illustrate that the
total reduction of NiO to metal Ni may require a temperature of over
400 °C. But, XRD presents that transformation of NiO to metallic
Ni has been achieved at 350 °C for 6 h reduction. This can be
attributed to the prolonged reduction time that compensates for the
insufficient temperature. However, Ni/ZnO adsorbent with pre-reduction
or in situ reduction at 250 °C showed the best RADS performance,
suggesting the total reduction of NiO as unnecessary. The surficial
reduction of NiO, avoiding formation of Ni-Zn alloy, is the best treatment
for the DBT RADS reaction. Our comparison investigation about the
pretreatment conditions for Ni/ZnO adsorbent presents the dynamic
process of active phase formation, and the illustration of the effect
of preparing and pretreating on the active structure and RADS property
is beneficial for application of Ni/ZnO adsorbent.

3 Conclusions
Ni/ZnO prepared by co-precipitation was used
as adsorbent for DBT
RADS. Their adsorption performance is related to calcination temperature,
precipitate washing solvent, and reduction temperature. The Ni/ZnO
adsorbent calcined at 350 °C, washed with ethanol, and unreduced
or reduced at low temperature performs best. The optimal calcination
temperature is due to a synergism between the decomposition of the
precursor and the small crystallite size of NiO and ZnO species. Washing
with ethanol enhances the surface area and decreases its particle
size. When the feed stream contains 500 ppm sulfur with DBT, the sulfur
capacity for a complete conversion of DBT at 250 °C and 1 MPa
is raised from 0.18 to 0.21 g-S/g-NiO/ZnO compared with the adsorbent
without ethanol washing. The high RADS activity of the unreduced or
low-temperature-reduced adsorbent is probably ascribed to the formation
of small Ni and ZnO particles.45 The effect
of reduction temperature on RADS performance is stronger than that
of calcination temperature because of formation of low-activity Ni-Zn
alloy during reduction treatment.

Experimental
Preparation of
Adsorbent
The Ni/ZnO adsorbent precursor
was prepared using the procedure described elsewhere,7 simply described as follows: A solution of 0.5 M Ni(NO3)2·6H2O and 0.5 M Zn(NO3)2·6H2O and a solution of 1M (NH4)2CO3 were dropped simultaneously into a beaker
containing deionized water at pH 7.0 and 90 °C with stirring
and aged for another 2 h, followed by filtration and washing four
times with deionized water under stirring for 30 min. The material
was exchanged through washing one time with ethanol (assigned as P-E)
or not (assigned as P-W). The dried P-E and P-W samples after calcining
at temperature x is assigned as CEx and CWx, respectively. Pure NiO and ZnO were prepared,
same as for the CE350. For characterization, a part of CE350 was reduced
in H2 of 9 mL/min and 1.0 MPa at temperatures of 250, 350,
and 450 °C for 6 h, then passivated under N2, and
cooled down to room temperature. The calcined adsorbent reduced at
temperature x is assigned as Rx.

Characterization
BET analysis was measured by N2 adsorption at 77.4 K
using a TriStar 3000 Gas Absorption
Analyzer (Micromeritics Instrument Co., USA). Prior to the measurement,
the dried P-E and P-W samples were degassed at 6.7 Pa and 80 °C
for 8 h, others at 200 °C and 6.7 Pa for 2 h.

A Bruker
AXS advanced D8X-ray diffractometer (Germany) with Cu Kα radiation
was used for XRD measurement at room temperature scanning in the 2θ
range of 20–85° at a step of 0.02°. The adsorbent
crystallite size was estimated using the Scherrer formula.17,18

H2 TPR was carried out on a microreactor with about
50 mg of sample loaded in each run. After purging at 100 °C for
1 h under an Ar flow of 30 mL/min and cooling to ambient temperature,
the gas was switched to 5% H2 in Ar at the same flow rate,
and then the system was heated from ambient temperature up to 600
°C at 10 °C/min. H2 consumption was monitored
by TCD and quantitatively calculated by calibration with the reduction
of an amount of CuO to Cu.

FTIR was conducted at ambient temperature
on a BRUKER TENSOR 27
instrument equipped with a LATGS detector. The resolution of the spectrum
(32-scan) was 4 cm–1.

The X-ray absorption
measurements for the reduction experiment
were performed at the 1W1B beamline of Beijing Synchrotron Radiation
Facility, Institute of High Energy Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences.
10 mg of adsorbent precursor is diluted in 30 mg of BN, pressed in
the form of pellets (100/160 mesh), then calcined in air for 3 h at
350 °C, and used for XAFS experiments. With in situ XAFS measurement,
the pellets were loaded into a stainless steel chamber with beryllium
windows. The sample was heated in He flow from ambient temperature
to 400 °C at 1 atm, and then the gas was switched to a flow of
20 mL/min 5%H2/95%He mixture (1 MPa). Ni K-edge was monitored
using QEXAFS technique.

WinXAS 3.2 was used for X-ray absorption
spectra analysis.43 The pre- and post-edge
were fitted to linear
polynomials for subtraction of background and normalization, respectively.
After the first derivative of the edge region, the maximum was referred
as E0. The mue(0)-fit was conducted using
cubic spline fitting, and the amount and type of various phases under
the reaction conditions were determined by least-square fitting procedure
and PCA.44 The Fourier transform from k3-weighted EXAFS to R space
was conducted by Gaussian window function in the k range of 3 to11.5 Å–1.

RADS Reactions
The RADS of DBT was performed in a tube
microreactor of 6 mm internal diameter. About 0.1 g of 40–60
mesh NiO/ZnO mixed with about 0.4 g of SiO2 was loaded
at the constant temperature region in each run. The reaction pressure
was controlled by the back pressure regulator. The feed containing
DBT (500 ppm S) in n-nonane was fed into the reactor
by high-pressure liquid pump. For the reduction treatment, the oxide
adsorbent was reduced in situ at temperatures of 250, 350, and 450
°C for 6 h in a H2 flow of 9 mL/min and 1.0 MPa prior
to the RADS reaction. Then, the reactor was cooled to 250 °C;
the feed (1.8 mL/h) was admitted into the reactor. For the no reduction
treatment, when the temperature was heated in N2 to 250
°C (1 atm), the feed (1.8 mL/h) and H2 (9 mL/min and
1.0 MPa) were admitted simultaneously into the reactor. The RADS experiment
was carried out at 250 °C and 1 MPa with H2/oil of
300 and LHSV of 13 h–1. The feed and product were
analyzed by a Shimadzu GC-14B gas chromatograph with FID and J&W
Scientific DB-1 60 m capillary column.
