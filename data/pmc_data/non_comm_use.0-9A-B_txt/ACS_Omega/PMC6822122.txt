The bacterial RNA
polymerase is a multi-subunit enzyme complex
composed of six subunits, α2ββ’σω.
The function of this enzyme is to transcribe the DNA base sequence
to the RNA intermediate, which is ultimately translated to protein.
Though the contribution of each subunit in RNA synthesis has been
clearly elucidated, the role of the smallest ω-subunit is still
unclear despite several studies. Recently, a study on a dominant negative
mutant of rpoZ has been reported in which the mutant
was shown to render the RNA polymerase defective in transcription
initiation (ω6, N60D) and gave an insight on the
function of ω in RNA polymerase. Serendipitously, we also obtained
a silent mutant, and the mutant was found to be lethal during the
isolation of toxic mutants. The primary focus of this study is to
understand the mechanistic details of this lethality. Isolated ω
shows a predominantly unstructured circular dichroism profile and
becomes α-helical in the enzyme complex. This structural transition
is perhaps the reason for this lack of function. Subsequently, we
generated several silent mutants of ω to investigate the role
of codon bias and the effect of rare codons with respect to their
position in rpoZ. Not all silent mutations affect
the structure. RNA polymerase when reconstituted with structurally
altered silent mutants of ω is transcriptionally inactive. The
CodonPlus strain, which has surplus tRNA, was used to assess for the
rescue of the phenotype in lethal silent mutants.

Introduction
Molecular machines
pass on the information stored in the genetic
material to a functional protein, and the sequence of events is known
as the central dogma.1 One of the key players
of the information transfer is the enzyme RNA polymerase, catalyzing
the first step transcription from DNA to mRNA. The mRNA molecule is
then ultimately translated to protein molecules with the help of ribosomes
and tRNA.2−6 Transcription is one of the key processes of the central dogma and
is intimately tied to the ability of cells to ″make decisions″
about the genes that should be expressed.3,7,8 The bacterial RNA polymerase (RNAP) holoenzyme
is a multi-subunit complex (α2ββ’ωσ)
that performs the essential function of gene transcription.9 Given the role of RNA polymerase in the central
dogma, it was assumed that all the subunits of RNA polymerase would
be essential for the survival of the bacteria. However, this is not
the case with the smallest subunit ω encoded by the rpoZ gene. ω is a small protein with 91 amino acids
and has a molecular mass of 10 kDa.

With the increasing availability
of the genome sequences of bacteria,
archaeal, and eukaryote, it has become clear that the ω-subunit
is conserved in all branches of life. In eukaryotes, there exists
a structural and functional homologue of ω, RPB6, which is found to be associated with RNAP I, II, and III. Further,
in archaea, there exists the ω homologue termed RpoK.10 However, over the years, ω was
unaccepted as an essential subunit in bacteria mainly because of the
following two major observations. In vivo deletion of rpoZ is tolerated in bacterial cells unlike the other subunits of RNA
polymerase.11 In addition, reconstitution
of Escherichia coli RNA polymerase
was achieved with purified α, β, and β’ subunits,
thereby pointing at the redundancy of ω.12 Eventually, ω was validated as the integral part
of RNA polymerase machinery in vivo when the direct association of
ω with the β’ subunit of RNA polymerase was shown.13 The subsequent crystal structure of Thermus aquaticus RNA polymerase supported this idea.14 Experiments with RNA polymerase isolated from
ω-less strain showed that the multi-subunit enzyme complex copurifies
with GroEL, a global chaperone protein, whose removal results in loss
of activity of the RNA polymerase enzyme complex.15 This observation indicates that GroEL substitutes for the
function of ω in protection and recruitment of β’
during RNA polymerase assembly in a ω-less strain. In support
of this argument, it was observed in the RNA polymerase crystal structure
that the ω-subunit is latched on to the C-terminal of the β’
subunit in such a fashion that a chaperone role of ω in the
folding β’ subunit can be envisaged.14 Thus, to examine a system where the functional role of
ω can be elucidated without the effect of accessory protein(s),
a toxic mutant screen was employed. Mutants were isolated in a way
that they would thwart the entry of GroEL in RNA polymerase. This
would render the RNA polymerase bound with mutant ω (ω6, N60D) inactive during the downstream process.16 This toxic mutant screen led to the serendipitous
discovery of a silent mutant ω9, which was lethal.
Interestingly, the silent mutant of ω was structured as compared
to wild type ω protein, which is mostly disordered.

The
genetic code is degenerate, which means that there are multiple
codes for the same amino acid. Silent mutations occur when the change
of the DNA sequence within a protein-coding portion of a gene does
not affect the sequence of amino acids that make up the protein.17−19 This change typically takes place at the third position of the codon
also known as the wobble position. A change in one or two nucleotides,
however, does not inevitably alter the triplet’s meaning; the
mutated triplet may still code for the same amino acid. Initially
thought to be irrelevant, studies have shown that the occurrence of
synonymous codons is nonrandom. In an organism, recurrently used codons
are translated rapidly and are termed as frequent codons, while the
scarcely used codons are translated at a slower rate and are known
as rare codons. Thus, this nonuniform distribution of codons in a
gene and abundance of the corresponding isoacceptor tRNA hints at
the nonuniform rate of mRNA translation.20−26 Protein expression studies in Escherichia coli suggested that translation kinetics and synonymous codon usage can
affect protein folding and functions.27−32 There are also reports that have shown that silent polymorphism
can lead to the altered structure and function of the protein.33

Anfinsen’s pioneering work showed
that a polypeptide chain
adopts the native structure, spontaneously, or in other words, the
amino acid sequence determines the structure.34 Protein folding obeys a sequential model with a distinct path and
intermediates. However, kinetic and thermodynamic parameters of this
path are unamenable to measurements in vivo. Attempts to achieve refolding
of denatured protein in vitro were partially successful.35 In vivo nascent proteins acquire native structures
co- and post-translationally, with their half-lives in the range of
seconds to minutes, whereas the rate of protein folding varies from
seconds to hours in vitro.36−39

After the seminal experiment of Anfinsen on
reversible denaturation
of ribonuclease, many experiments have suggested cotranslational folding
of proteins, small or large in vivo.24,40−45 Protein biosynthesis without cotranslational folding is likely to
be energetically unfavorable.43 The addition
of amino acid on a growing polypeptide chain is dependent on the readability
of the frequency of codon, rare or frequent.24,44−46 Though recent studies suggest that silent mutations
can affect the final protein structure, it is unknown if its position
within the sequence is relevant. Silent mutation at different positions
of the genes will address a few critical questions: (a) will a protein
synthesized from silent mutation at different positions necessarily
have the same structure as that of wild type protein? (b) does the
substitution of a frequent codon to rare codon lead to drastic structure
alteration? (c) what is the exact nature of the mutant proteins synthesized
from silent mutation in varying positions?

In the present study,
we generated several silent mutants by replacing
frequent codons to rare codons at different positions of the rpoZ gene. This allowed us to determine the delicate balance
that exists between the positional effects of codon usage in ω.
The important function that was monitored here was the reconstitution
of active RNA polymerase with ω variants.

Results
Characterization
of the Silent Mutant ω9
The principal aim
of this work was to understand the mechanism
behind the structural changes in the ω silent mutant that leads
to transcriptionally inactive RNA polymerase. We have shown before
that a point mutation results in inactive RNA polymerase with concomitant
changes in the helicity of the ω.16 We have also shown in a recent work that this structural alteration
manifests themselves in the strength of binding of β’
with the ω-subunit.48 We would like
to emphasize that the silent mutation here for alanine (GCC →
GCT) showed no change in the protein sequence yet we observe a lethal
phenotype upon induction of protein synthesis (Figure 1A). The ω9 mutant was obtained
as described in Sarkar et al.16 It must
be mentioned here that, at the beginning, we ensured that the overexpression
system was not harmful due to the aggregation of proteins and they
were purified through overexpression plasmid pET-ω with the
T7 promoter. However, we observed no difference in phenotype upon
expression of native type and mutant proteins with various promoters.
We did not want to alter the chromosomal copy of the rpoZ since the polar effect of the mutation plays an important role in Escherichia coli.

There are four codons coding for alanine, and the
codon usage indexes
for all of them are shown in Table 1. It has been reported before that concentration of
the cognate tRNA for rare codon (GCT) is 5 times less concentration
than the other tRNA for alanine.47,49 To evaluate
the significance of this silent mutant, CD spectroscopy was performed
with purified proteins (Figure 1B). We used CD spectroscopy to measure the amount of secondary
structure in both wild type ω and silent mutant ω9. We observed that ω9 is more structured
(45% helical) than wild type ω (16% helical) (Figure 1C). Mass spectroscopic analysis
of the purified protein was performed to eliminate the possibility
of misincorporation of an amino acid at the mutation site (Figure S1).

a There are four codons coding for
alanine. Out of these, GCG is the most frequent, and GCT is the rarest
codon for alanine. The codon usage index tells the frequency with
which that codon is used relative to other codons coding for the same
amino acid. The codon usage index reported here is for Escherichia coli.50,51

In Vitro Refolding To Determine the Minimum
Energy Structure
of a Protein with the Same Amino Acid Sequence
As mentioned
previously, it is established that “the final 3D structure
of a protein is defined from its primary amino acid sequence in a
given environment”.34 Here, it was
observed that, despite possessing the same amino acid sequence, silent
mutant ω9 acquires a different structure from the
wild type ω. The proteins were His-tagged and purified from
the soluble cell extract fraction by Ni (II) affinity chromatography.
We were interested to find out whether the altered CD profile is in
a stable conformation, and thus, urea-dependent denaturation and renaturation
experiments were performed. The proteins were completely denatured
at time point 0 (urea concn 7 M) (Figure S2). At the 10th hour, the protein refolded back with removal of urea
(urea concn 10 pM), as shown in Figure 2. Another ω-variant ω6, a lethal
mutant (N60D) that shows α-helicity, was used as a control.
ω6 upon going through the urea denaturation–renaturation
cycle reverted to its α-helical conformation. However, ω9 reverted to a disordered state like native ω. This
observation hints that purified ω9, to start with,
was not in its stable conformation.

Figure 2 In vitro refolding. Upon complete denaturation
by 7 M urea followed
by refolding by dialyzing the proteins against renaturing buffer,
ω9 folds to a similar structure to wild type ω.
ω6(N60D) retains its original structure.

Subsequent analysis by size-exclusion chromatography experiments
showed that the wild type, as well as mutant proteins, existed as
monomers as shown in Figure S3. This rules
out the possibility that the change in the structure of the protein
is due to the change in the oligomeric status of the protein.

Analyzing
Codon Usage in rpoZ Gene
We wanted to find
out the influence of the rarity of the codons as
well as their positions in shaping the secondary structure of the
protein. Codon optimality represents a function of the stochastic
nature of ribosome decoding of mRNA and the variability of tRNA concentrations.
A codon can be defined either as a frequent or a rare codon depending
on how efficiently the appropriate cognate tRNA can be selected from
the cytoplasmic pool of tRNAs.45,47 As follows, codons
can be a powerful determinant of translational rates. As shown in Figure 3, rpoZ, which remain a class I gene in Escherichia coli, hardly has any nonoptimal or rare codons. The rare codon for alanine,
GCU, is present 5 times in the frame and are located close to each
other (Figure 4A).
Upon generation of silent mutation at the 82nd position, GCC to GCU,
one more time, the rare codon for alanine is introduced proximal to
the previously mentioned positions. Our subsequent attempt was to
alter the next position, that is, 83rd for valine (GTT → GTA).
We altered the third base to introduce the rare codon in place of
a frequent codon for valine. However, mutation at this position did
not show lethality in the growth curve upon protein induction or CD
profile of the protein (Figure S4).

Figure 3 Codons used
in rpoZ gene. rpoZ is marked by
the presence of fast codons. Rare codons like AGG and
AGA for arginine and AUA for isoleucine are not used in the gene.

mutants. The rest of the CD profiles are in Figure S8.

Positional Effect of Introduction
of Rare Codon in rpoZ
It is well recognized
that the local rate of translation
correlates with the codon usage, which in turn correlates with tRNA
population in cells. There is no absolute definition of the rare or
frequent codon, but a relative definition can be described. As follows,
we decided to investigate the effect of rare codons in rpoZ in Escherichia coli MG1655. Two rare
codons, AGA and AGG, which code for arginine, occur 123 times in the
essential genes and 4288 times in the entire genome.52 On the other hand, isoleucine encoded by AUA is another
rare codon that occurs 148 times in essential genes as opposed to
5620 times in the entire genome.53 Codon
usage indexes for all codons encoding arginine and isoleucine are
presented in Table 2. Reports showed that these codons are translated at a lower rate.54 To our benefit, none of these rare codons are
present in rpoZ, as shown in Figure 3. We generated a series of silent mutants
with these rare codons introduced at a different position along the rpoZ. Such changes allowed us to investigate the positional
effect of a rare codon. Positions of silent mutants on the DNA sequence
of rpoZ are shown in Figure 4A. They are equally marked in the overall
structure of ω (Figure 4B), along with the list of mutants. The CD spectra for two
mutants are shown in Figure 4C. Mass spectroscopic analysis was performed with purified
protein to confirm the protein sequence (not shown).

It can be noted from Figure 4C that the mutant ω7 like ω9 is more structured than native ω. There are two sites where
a frequent isoleucine codon is mutated to the rare codon, and there
are only three codons in between the sites of mutations. However,
ω1 has a mutation in the N-terminal of the protein
and does not demonstrate any structural change (Figure 4C). It can be seen from Figure S5 that the mutants ω2, ω10, and ω5 like ω9 are more
structured than native ω. All these mutations occur at the C-terminal
unstructured region of the proteins. All other mutants (ω3, ω11, ω12) show little
structural element. ω7, ω10, and
ω9 have this characteristic feature where the rare
codons are present repetitively. They are also present close to each
other near the C-terminal and fall in the disordered region predicted
by PONDR54 (Figure 5A). Mutant-like ω11 (arginine
silent mutant at the 90th and 91st positions) does not show any change
in phenotype or CD spectra of the purified protein. It appears that
they fall at the end of the protein synthesis and might not impact
the overall sequential folding of the protein.

coli CodonPlus strain. (A) Secondary structure prediction

Phenotype Rescue in CodonPlus
Strain
ω is unstructured
in its soluble state, as shown in Figure 1B. Moreover, many algorithms have predicted
unstructured segments in ω (12–18%) (Figure 5A). However, when we inspected
the crystal structure of Escherichia coli RNA polymerase, we observed that ω is more structured in its
bound state (63% helical) (Figure 5A). These observations prompted us to think that there
is binding-induced folding of ω, and this is important for proper
assembly and functioning of RNA polymerase.

There occurs a correlation
between codon usage and tRNA population present in the cells, which
occupies a crucial role in fine-tuning the local translation kinetics.
The tRNA population cognate for the frequent codon is present in abundance
in cells, and that for the rare codon is infrequent in the cellular
milieu, which in turn affects the translational kinetics.46,47 This prompted us to think that the manipulation of the local concentrations
of tRNA can influence the translation rate and finally the folding
of the protein. Thus, if cells are provided with surplus tRNA copies
for the cognate rare codon, folding of the protein can be altered.

The silent mutants, which have acquired structures as opposed to
that of wild type ω, were expressed in an Escherichia
coli CodonPlus strain, which carries an extra gene
encoding tRNA cognate for codons AGG, AGA (arginine), and AUA (isoleucine).
ω7 was expressed in the CodonPlus strain (isoleucine
silent mutant at the 49th and 54th positions), and CD spectroscopy
was performed on the purified protein. It can be seen from Figure 5B that purified ω7 from the CodonPlus strain shows an unstructured CD profile
as against that of ω7 isolated from BL21. Expectedly,
the lethality of the dominant-negative phenotype of Escherichia coli cells with ω7 (BL21)
was rescued in the ω7 (CodonPlus) strain in the CFU
assay (Figure S6).

Transcriptional Activity
of RNA Polymerase Reconstituted in
Vitro with Wild Type ω and Its Silent Mutants
ω
is a disordered protein, and it has been shown that its flexibility
is crucial for the purpose it serves. Studies have shown that the
high intramolecular flexibility and plasticity of disordered proteins
permit them to bind to their target with high specificity and modulate
their function. Structured mutants of ω are rigid as compared
to the flexible native protein. We envisaged that the inherent floppiness
of the native ω is important for the proper assembly and mobility
necessary for the multi-subunit complex RNAP. To verify this, we reconstituted
RNA polymerase from individual subunits in vitro (as shown in Figure S7) and performed a single round transcription
assay (Figure 6). RNAP
reconstituted with ω6 was used as a negative control
for the experiment. Transcription was carried out in the presence
of 0.2 μg/μL heparin essentially to establish the pattern
of single round runoff transcription. RNA polymerase isolated from Escherichia coli RL916 acting as a positive control.
Reconstituted RNA polymerase with native ω showed single round
transcription, which was inhibited by rifampicin. RNA polymerase reconstituted
with silent mutant ω7 was transcriptionally inactive,
but single round transcription with ω7 (CodonPlus)
was positive. We carried out the structural analysis that shows the
interaction between ω7 and β’ in the
RNA polymerase complex, as shown in Figure S5B. It shows that the mutation site and β’ residues are
present near (5 Å) to each other. A multiround transcription
assay was performed with RNA polymerase reconstituted with all the
mutants, as depicted in Figure S7, indicating
almost 5 times reduced activity for RNA polymerase reconstituted with
structured ω mutants.

Partial Proteolysis of
ω and Its Silent Mutant by Trypsin
Limited or partial
proteolysis is a classic biochemical technique
employed to get information regarding the change in protein structure
and conformation. Since native ω is an intrinsically disordered
protein and its silent mutants are structured, they are expected to
indicate the differential rate of digestion by protease. ω has
12 trypsin sites as shown in Figure 7A. We learned from this experiment that, in ω7, the C-terminal is getting structured as opposed to that
of wild type ω. The differential rate of digestion by trypsin
can be noted in Figure 7B. Mass spectrometric analysis of the assay mixture informed us that
there is delayed cutting for intermediate and C-terminal regions of
the protein.

at a faster rate than ω7.

ppGpp Interaction with RNAP Reconstituted with ω and Its
Silent Mutant
Results on the single round transcription assay
presented in a previous section prompted us to assess the binding
of ppGpp to RNA polymerase. ppGpp is a nucleotide second messenger,
which is known to bind at the ω and β’ interface
as shown in Figure 8A, which is located at 28 Å distance from the active site of
the polymerase complex. ppGpp binding to RNA polymerase possesses
a profound effect in regulating Escherichia coli transcription.55 We examined this interaction
to understand the influence of ω variants in ppGpp recognition
of the enzyme. ppGpp binding to RNA polymerase was titrated by measuring
the change in heat capacity of the reaction upon binding. We studied
binding affinity of ppGpp to RNA polymerase (α2ββ’ω),
RNA polymerase reconstituted with ω9 (α2ββ’ω9), and RNA polymerase
reconstituted with ω7 (α2ββ’ω7). We observed that there was a reduced binding affinity for
ppGpp to RNAP-ω9 and RNAP-ω7. It
indicates that RNA polymerase assembly with mutant ω is defective
and that could result in inactive RNA polymerase.

variants by isothermal calorimetry. (A) Snapshot

The PDB ID of the crystal structure of RNA polymerase is 4JKR.

Discussion
In an open system, Gibb’s free energy
(ΔG = ΔH – TΔS) describes the equilibrium. The
conversion of unstructured
ω to structured ω is accompanied by a negative entropy
change, which is compensated by the change in enthalpy. As a result,
the overall change in free energy is predominantly negative. By a
series of measurements using different techniques, it has been shown
that the mutant ω has a stronger binding with the rest of the
core enzyme in comparison to that of native ω.50

Structured ω does bind to α2ββ’
assembly, which is evident from in vitro reconstitution, but they
were defective in transcription. This again hints at the importance
of disorderedness of ω. It is well recognized that β’
F (bridge)-helix and β’ G-loop encompasses the active
centers of RNA polymerase and they work in a coordinated fashion to
warrant the proper placement of NTPs at the active site and their
incorporation into the elongating transcripts. We argue that, due
to the binding of the structured ω, the mobility of the flexible
segments at the active site is affected, which manifests into the
abrogation of initiation of transcription.56

It appears that the paradigm that describes a direct correlation
between structure and function of a protein is not always true with
the discovery of the intrinsically disordered proteins. In the last
decade, there is a growing amount of evidence for intrinsically disordered
proteins, which marks the above assumption.57 The smallest subunit of RNA polymerase, ω falls in the category
of intrinsically disordered protein. Previous reports have shown that
the flexibility of ω is critically important for its function
and interaction with β’.

Silent mutations were
considered inconsequential in terms of protein
folding for an extensive period since the encoded protein sequence
remains unaltered. However, in eukaryotes, they are appreciated to
have an impact on a specialized process like gene splicing and expression
levels. However, they are not entirely silent mutants. Although the
protein sequence remains the same, the DNA and mRNA sequences are
altered due to introduction of the silent mutation. While considering
the role of silent mutants, two levels of control need to be considered:
(a) rate of translation and (b) mRNA stability. Both may vary as a
function of the frequency of codon usage, which would reflect on the
protein folding. In the recent past, few observations elegantly demonstrated
this point. It would be a bonus for the researchers if differential
folding due to single silent mutation exhibits an altered phenotype.

Any study with such a system will direct us to observe the utility
of the frequent codon or rare codons, as well as the influence of
their positions on the reading frame.

In the present study,
the reconstituted RNA polymerase with different
ω-subunits shows a lethal dominant-negative phenotype where
transcription was inhibited by the same ω-sequence but with
an altered folded structure. This unique observation was supported
by mainly two experiments, CD studies and single round transcription
assay. The former shows a clear folding pattern, whereas the latter
demonstrates the functionality. Both experiments are definitive but
unfortunately cannot infer various stages of structural alteration
or lethality during the path of folding. Our assay mainly focuses
on defects in transcription initiation, and thus, we believe that
the structure of the active site occupies a critical role.

What
represents the nature of this different folded state as they
have the same sequence of amino acids? We would like to define them
as ″metastable″ state emanated from an altered rate
of translation or mRNA stability. That they are metastable and Anfinsen
principle ultimately guides their destiny was shown by in vitro urea
denaturation–renaturation experiments. As the timescales for
protein synthesis and folding are often similar, it is quite evident
that the rate of translation can be used to tune the assembly of the
growing polypeptide. In this respect, the position of the mutation
plays a dominant role. We mentioned before that ω is an intrinsically
disordered protein and plasticity of the disordered region during
assembly of the functional enzyme is significant. It is interesting
to note that all dominant-negative mutants map at the C-terminal region.
Thus, it would be worthwhile to investigate which factor-like translation
by ribosome or the mRNA structure is playing a significant role here.

Material
and Methods
Protein Purification of Wild Type ω and Its Silent Mutants
DNA sequence coding for ω was cloned into vector pET-28b
(Novagen) using NcoI/Hind III restriction sites and was termed as
pET-ω. Recombinant plasmids were transformed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) grown on LB agar plates
containing 50 μg/mL kanamycin. ω and its mutant were purified
from the Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3)
strain transformed unless mentioned otherwise with plasmid pET-ω.
The cells were grown at 37 °C to an OD600 of 0.6,
induced with a final concentration of 1 mM IPTG, and grown further
for 3 h. Cells were harvested, and the pellet was dissolved in lysis
buffer (50 mM Tris–HCl, pH 7.9; 100 mM NaCl; 1 mM PMSF; 2 mM
EDTA; 10 mM benzamidine). Cells were lysed by sonication. The soluble
fraction containing the protein was loaded onto a Ni-NTA column pre-equilibrated
with the lysis buffer. The column was washed with wash buffer (50
mM Tris–HCl, pH 7.9, 1 mM PMSF, 100 mM NaCl, 10 mM benzamidine,
20 mM imidazole). The protein was eluted out with an elution buffer
(50 mM Tris–HCl, pH 7.9, 1 mM PMSF, 100 mM NaCl, 10 mM benzamidine,
0.5 M imidazole). The fractions containing the pure protein were pooled
together and dialyzed against storage buffer (20 mM Tris–HCl,
pH 7.9; 100 mM NaCl; 0.1 mM DTT; 0.1 mM EDTA, and 50% glycerol). Dialysis
was performed at 4 °C for 16 h. The purity of protein was confirmed
by analysis on 15% SDS-PAGE, and the concentrations were estimated
by the Bradford assay.

Circular Dichroism Spectroscopy
Far UV spectra of ω
and its mutants were recorded on a JASCO J-715 CD spectropolarimeter.
Buffer used was 50 mM Tris–HCl and 100 mM NaCl, pH 7.9. Mean
residue ellipticity was estimated using the formula [θ] = (1000
× θ × m)/L × C, where θ is the measured ellipticity in degrees, m is the mean residue weight in g/d mol, C is the concentration in g/L, and L is the path
length in cm. The percent α-helicity was calculated using K2D2
software.58 Protein concentrations used
were in the range of 0.2–0.6 mg/mL.

Generation of Silent Mutants
of ω at Different Positions
Mutations were carried
out in pET-ω vector bearing wild type
ω gene. In order to generate silent mutants of ω, site-directed
mutagenesis was performed. Gradient PCR was performed using the primers
presented in the primer list in Table S1. Following PCR amplification of the vector, amplified products were
checked on 1% agarose gel and gel extraction was performed from the
band having the desired product. The gel-extracted product was subjected
to ligation using T4 DNA ligase provided by NEB followed by DpnI digestion and transformation in the DH5α strain
of Escherichia coli. DpnI digestion was performed to remove the parent plasmid. Cloning results
were confirmed by sequencing, and the protein sequence was confirmed
by mass analysis.

Refolding Experiment
Purified ω,
ω9, and ω6 proteins were subjected
to denaturation
by incubating them with 7 M urea overnight. Urea was dialyzed out
in a stepwise manner against the renaturing buffer (50 mM Tris–HCl,
100 mM NaCl), and aliquots were collected every 2 h. Protein refolding
was followed by CD spectroscopy.

Reconstitution of RNA Polymerase from Purified Subunits
Purified subunits Hexahis-α, β, β’, and
ω and its silent mutants were mixed in a molar ratio of 2:8:4:1
in a mild denaturation buffer (50 mM Tris–HCl, pH 7.9 at 4
°C; 200 mM KCl; 10 mM MgCl2; 10% glycerol; 1 mM EDTA,
10 μM ZnCl2, and 0.25% N-lauryl
sarcosine with 10 mM DTT) and kept for an hour at 4 °C. The volume
of the reconstitution mixture was kept at 10 mL with a total protein
concentration of 1.5 mg/mL. The reconstitution mixture was next dialyzed
for 16 h at 4 °C, against 1 L of reconstitution buffer (50 mM
Tris–HCl, pH 7.9 at 4 °C; 200 mM KCl; 10 mM MgCl2; 20% glycerol; 0.1 mM EDTA, 10 μM ZnCl2 with 1
mM DTT). The dialyzed sample was centrifuged at 32000g for 30 min, and the clear supernatant was collected. The supernatant
was loaded onto the Ni-NTA column matrix, which was pre-equilibrated
with the same refolding buffer. The column was washed with 5 column
volumes wash buffer (50 mM Tris–HCl, pH 7.9 at 4 °C; 200
mM NaCl; 5% glycerol; 0.1 mM EDTA; 0.1 mM DTT; 20 mM imidazole), and
the protein was eluted out with an elution buffer (50 mM Tris–HCl,
pH 7.9 at 4 °C; 400 mM NaCl; 5% glycerol; 0.1 mM EDTA; 0.1 mM
DTT; 250 mM imidazole). The elusions were checked on an 8–15%
gradient SDS-PAGE gel for the presence of the subunits. Eluents from
the Ni-NTA column were pooled and concentrated with the help of 100
kDa Centricon. Concentrated RNAP was loaded onto a Heparin-Sepharose
column pre-equilibrated with the refolding buffer. The protein was
eluted with the elution buffer (10 mM Tris–HCl, pH 7.9 at 4
°C; 800 mM NaCl; 5% glycerol; 0.1 mM EDTA; 0.1 mM DTT). The fractions
were checked for the presence of core RNAP on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel,
and the purity of the protein was found to be >99%. Fractions containing
reconstituted core RNAP were pooled together and used for the single
round transcription assay immediately.

Single Round Transcription
Assay
Activity of reconstituted
RNAP using wild type ω and its silent mutants was checked by
the promoter specific transcription assay. Four picomoles of reconstituted
RNAP was preincubated with purified σ70 in a 1:2 molar ratio
at 37 ° C for 10 min in the transcription buffer (40 mM Tris–HCl
pH 7.9 at 4 ° C, 10 mM MgCl2, 75 mM KCl, 0.1 mM EDTA,
0.1 mM DTT, 14 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 0.025 mg/mL nuclease free
BSA) to allow formation of the holoenzyme. T7A1 promoter
DNA was added (0.4 pmol) and incubated for 20 min at 37 °C to
allow for specific promoter-RNAP complex formation. Next, the substrate-heparin
mixture, containing 0.15 mM ATP, 0.15 mM GTP, 0.15 mM CTP, 0.05 mM
UTP, and 2 μCi [α-P32]-UTP, was added. The mixture was
then incubated for 15 min at 37 °C to allow for the RNA chain
elongation reaction. The reaction was terminated with a Stop Solution
(5 mM EDTA and 100 μg/mL Escherichia coli tRNA). The transcript RNA was precipitated by ethanol, washed, and
then separated on a 10% denaturing polyacrylamide gel containing 6
M urea. The gel was put in a fixative solution and exposed to imaging
plates, and then the plates were analyzed by a phosphorimager (FLA2000;
Fujifilm).

Mass Spectrometry for Protein Analysis
To verify for
the protein of interest, in-gel trypsin digestion was performed alongside
ESI analysis. The band corresponding to a molecular marker of 14.4
kDa was cut, destained, and subjected to in-gel tryptic digestion,
at pH 7.5 (50 mM ammonium bicarbonate NH4HCO3), 37 °C overnight. The resulting mixture of tryptic peptides
extracted from the gel was passed through a reverse phase column (Zorbax
RX C18, 4.6 mm × 250 mm, 5 mm). A gradient elution using H2O/ACN/0.1% formic acid was followed at a flow rate of 0.2
mL min–1, and the eluting peptides were characterized
by conventional MS (LC-ESI-MS) and MS/MS (LC-ESI-MS/MS). An HCT Ultra
PTM Discovery mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics) has an ESI source
and houses a classic ion trap (Paul-type), using which both MS (LC-ESI-MS)
and tandem MS (LC-ESI-MS/MS) data were acquired. Both CID and ETD
can be carried out within this ion trap in an alternate manner, and
thus, the LC-ESI-MS/MS data generated are composed of those resulting
from both CID and ETD. While CID is carried out using helium, ETD
(ion/ion reaction) is accomplished using fluoranthene radical anions.
The fluoranthene radical anions are generated by means of negative
chemical ionization utilizing methane as the reagent gas. The ETD
(ion/ion) reaction time was set as 100 ms, and the supplemental collisional
activation (i.e., smart decomposition) was ON during ETD. The data
were processed using Data Analysis Version 4.0 (Bruker Daltonics).

Size-Exclusion Chromatography
Purified protein with
a concentration of 1 mg/mL (25 mM Tris–HCl and 100 mM NaCl)
was loaded on a Superdex S75 column. Size-exclusion chromatography
was performed using GE Healthcare FPLC. The flow rate of the buffer
was maintained at 0.3 mL/min. 100 μL volume of protein was injected
for the chromatography. Protein elusion was monitored at 315 nm.

Checking for Lethality upon Protein Induction
Single
colonies were inoculated into LB broth and incubated at 37 °C
temperature under shaking conditions. They were recultured in fresh
LB tubes with starting 0.1% culture and monitored until OD600 reached the value of 0.6. Dilutions were made using LB, and 10 μL
was spotted on LB agar plates. For control, plates were not infused
with IPTG; however, the test plates had 1 mM IPTG.

Partial Proteolysis
by Trypsin
1 mg of protein was
incubated with trypsin (Promega) for 2, 5, and 10 min in a ratio of
trypsin/protein at 1:50. Trypsin was heat-inactivated, and the reaction
mixture was loaded onto 20% SDS-PAGE and subjected to mass spectroscopic
analysis. All mass spectrometric analysis was performed using a Bruker
Ultraflextreme machine.

Isothermal Calorimetry
An ITC-200
microcalorimeter
(GE Healthcare) was used for calorimetry studies. In brief, RNAP reconstituted
with and without ω/ω7/ω9 was
taken in the concentration range of 20–50 μM, and ppGpp
concentration was varied from 0.1 to 5 mM in all the experiments.
Both the ligand and protein were dissolved in a buffer consisting
of 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.9, 150 mM NaCl and 0.5 mM β-mercaptoethanol.
ORIGIN software Version 7.0 (Microcal, Malvern, Worcestershire, U.K.)
was used to calculate the binding affinity (Ka). At the time of plotting, the heat of dilution for ppGpp
was subtracted and the first data point was removed from the experimental
curve as suggested by the analysis software.
