Transition-metal-catalyzed chlorosulfonylation of 5-ethynylpyrimidine
nucleosides provided (E)-5-(β-chlorovinyl)sulfones A, which undergo nucleophilic substitution with amines or
thiols affording B. The treatment of vinyl sulfones A with ammonia followed by acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of the
intermediary β-sulfonylvinylamines gave 5-(β-keto)sulfones C. The latter reacts with electrophiles, yielding α-carbon-alkylated
or -sulfanylated analogues D. The 5′-triphosphates
of A and C were incorporated into double-stranded
DNA, using open and one-nucleotide gap substrates, by human or Escherichia coli DNA-polymerase-catalyzed reactions.

==== Body
Introduction
The 5-modified pyrimidine
nucleosides have been extensively studied,
and many analogues exhibit a wide range of biological activity.1,2 For example, (E)-5-(2-bromovinyl)-2′-deoxyuridine3 and bicyclic furannopyrimidine-2-one analogues
display antiviral activity against varicella zoster virus (VZV)4 and 5-(trifluoromethyl)-2′-deoxyuridine
is used for the treatment of colorectal cancer.5 The introduction of reactive groups at the C5 position
of pyrimidine nucleobases such as alkyne6−9 or azide10−13 for Cu-catalyzed or strain-promoted
click chemistry, aldehyde14 for reductive
aminations,15 ene/diene for cycloaddition
reactions,16−19 vinyl sulfonamide for Michael additions,20,21 or chloroacetamide for nucleophilic substitutions22 has been explored23 for imaging
cellular DNA, bioconjugation with DNA-bound proteins, and applications
in the fluorescent bioanalysis of DNA and RNA.24 The 5′ triphosphates8,10,20,25 or 3′ phosphoroamidite26,27 of these probes were incorporated into oligonucleotides by DNA/RNA
polymerases or solid-phase synthesis.

The vinyl sulfones are
widely used intermediates in organic and
medicinal chemistry.28−30 The (β-halo)vinyl sulfones are gaining attention
as a new class of reactive sulfones.31 Recent
synthetic developments include metal-free stereoselective E-iodosulfonylation of internal alkynes with sodium phenyl
sulfinate and iodine to provide tetrasubstituted olefins,32 di-t-butyl peroxide/I2-promoted difunctionalization of alkynes with sodium benzenesulfinates
to give (E)-β-iodovinyl sulfones,33 and multicomponent reactions with insertion
of sulfur dioxide.34 The application of
(α-halo)vinyl sulfones to organic synthesis as well as nucleoside
and medicinal chemistry is also documented.35−37 The β-keto
sulfones are also important synthetic synthons.38,39 They have been synthesized from terminal alkynes via pyridine-catalyzed
dioxygen-triggered radical reactions40 or
in reactions of aryl/heteroaryl acetylenes with sulfonyl chloride
in the presence of catalytic amount of p-toluenesulfonic
acid.41 Both (β-halovinyl)sulfones
and (β-keto)sulfones exhibit important biological activities.
For example, vinyl sulfones act as inhibitors of cysteine proteases28 and human cathepsin L,42 whereas (β-keto)sulfones are selective inhibitors of 11β-hydroxysteroid
dehydrogenase type 1 (11β-HSD1).43

We have recently reported a stereoselective synthesis of (E)-5-(β-halovinyl)sulfone derivatives of uracil nucleosides
(e.g., II, Figure 1) by transition-metal-catalyzed or radical-mediated halovinylsulfonylation
of 5-ethynyluracils I with TsNa or TsNHNH2 in the presence of NXS (X = Br, I) or FeX3 (X = Cl, Br),
respectively, as halogen sources.44 5-(β-Halovinyl)sulfones II underwent efficient stereoselective addition–elimination
with nucleophiles (NuH) such as thiols or amines to provide E-β-thiovinyl or Z-β-aminovinyl
sulfones III and IV. The 3′,5′-di-O-acetyl-5-(E)-(1-chloro-2-tosylvinyl)-2′-deoxyuridine
(II; X = Cl, R = Ac; compound 9a in Table 1) inhibited the growth
of L1210 (IC50 5.6 μM), CEM, and HeLa cancer cells
in the lower micrometer range.45 It also
displayed micromolar activity against varicella zoster virus (VZV;
EC50 4 μM).45 Moreover,
the lack of activity of 9a with the thymidine kinase-deficient
VZV strain implies the importance of phosphorylation in the metabolism
of these compounds.

In this article, we extend the halosulfonylation reaction to cytosine
nucleosides and describe the conversion of the uridine and cytidine
5-(β-halovinyl)sulfone derivatives to 5-(β-keto)sulfone
probes. We report, herein, two classes of 5-modified uracil and cytosine
nucleosides, their selective bioconjugation with nucleophiles or electrophiles,
and the incorporation of their 5′-phosphates into double-stranded
DNA by human or Escherichia coli DNA-polymerase-catalyzed
reactions. One class contains a (β-chlorovinyl)sulfone probe
that efficiently reacts with nucleophiles, including amino acid thiols,
via the addition–elimination pathway, whereas the second class
bears a β-keto sulfone probe at the C5 position that reacts
with electrophiles and disulfides.

Results and Discussion
Synthesis
and Reactivity of (β-Chlorovinyl)sulfone or
(β-Keto)sulfone Probes
The treatment of 2′,3′,5′-tri-O-acetyl-5-ethynylcytosine 1 with tosyl hydrazide
(3 equiv) in the presence of FeCl3 (2 equiv) and t-butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP; 4 equiv) gave (E)-5-(β-chlorovinyl)sulfone 3 (Scheme 1). Analogous chlorosulfonylation
of the protected 5-ethynyl-2′-deoxycytidine 2 provided
β-chlorovinyl sulfone 4, which also demonstrated
the stability of the glycosylic bond in the labile 2′-deoxy
substrates.

Scheme 1 Synthesis of 5-(β-Chlorovinyl)sulfone Derivatives
of Cytidine
and 2′-Deoxycytidine
The 5-(β-halovinyl)sulfones underwent an efficient
addition–elimination
reaction with nucleophiles such as amines or thiols,44 as demonstrated by the reaction of 4 with n-PrSH, which provided 7 (80%, Scheme 2). The treatment of 5-(1-chloro-2-tosylvinyl)-2′-deoxyuridine 5 (56 mM; H2O/MeOH, 1:4) with tripeptide l-glutathione (1.5 equiv) in the presence of trimethylamine (TEA,
3 equiv) at room temperature (rt) for 4 h led to nucleophilic substitution
of chloride to give 8a (55%) after high-performance liquid
chromatography (HPLC) purification. 5′-O-phosphate 6 (47 mM; H2O/MeOH, 4:1; see Scheme 4 for the synthesis of 6) coupled
(rt, 4 h) with l-glutathione in aqueous solution in the presence
of TEA (3 equiv) affording 8b (54%) after purification
on a Sephadex column. Phosphate 6 (34 mM) also reacted
with glutathione (1.2 equiv) in triethylammonium acetate (TEAA) buffer,
under the conditions similar to those for the bioconjugation of glutathione
with a chloroacetamide probe attached to the C5 position of dCMP (87
mM),22 providing 8b (58%).
Because bioconjugation of a chloroacetamide probe attached to short
oligodeoxynucleotides with peptides or proteins also occurred efficiently
at a lower concentration (0.1 μM),22 it can be expected that 5-(β-chlorovinyl)sulfone-modified
DNA might also serve as a probe for bioconjugation with peptides or
proteins.

Scheme 2 Nucleophilic Substitution of 5-(β-Chlorovinyl)sulfones
with
Thiols
The treatment of 2′,3′,5′-tri-O-acetyluridine 5-(β-chlorovinyl)sulfone 9b with
methanolic ammonia at rt resulted in a concomitant deacetylation and
vinylic substitution to give intermediary (Z)-β-sulfonylvinylamine
(enamine) 10 as a single isomer.44,46 We now found that careful acid hydrolysis of 10 with
HCl (pH ∼ 3–4) in MeCN afforded 5-(β-keto)sulfone 13 (74% from 9b; Table 1, entry 3). Subjection of the unprotected
or protected 5-(β-chlorovinyl)sulfones of 2′-deoxyuridine
(5 or 9a) and unprotected uridine (9c) to this amination/hydrolysis sequence afforded 5-(β-keto)sulfones
(12 or 13; entries 1–2 and 4). Cytidine
and 2′-deoxycytidine sulfones (3 or 4) were converted via a similar two-step one-pot protocol into 5-(β-keto)sulfones 14 and 15, illustrating its general character
(entries 5 and 6). It is noteworthy that 2′-deoxycytidine substrate 4 provided β-sulfonylvinylamine 11 as a
mixture of E/Z isomers (3:7), which
was confirmed by the correlation between H6 (7.84 ppm) and the vinylic
proton (4.95 ppm) in the nuclear Overhauser enhancement spectra for
the major isomer. The β-keto sulfones attached to the C5 position
of pyrimidine nucleobases can be envisioned as mechanistically different
probes than 5-(β-chlorovinyl)sulfones as they can trap electrophiles
rather than nucleophiles because they possess a methylene acidic proton
(pKa = 10–11).47

As anticipated, the treatment of 5-(β-keto)sulfone 12 with BnBr in the presence of aqueous NaOH at rt afforded
α-monobenzylated product 16a as a diastereotopic
mixture with no α-dialkylated product observed (Table 2, entry 1). However, the benzylation
was also observed at the N3 position and byproduct 16b (17%) was isolated. The alkylation of 12 with MeI or
allyl bromide and of 13 with allyl bromide also provided
α-alkylated products 17–19 (entries
2–4). As expected, 2′-deoxycytosine 14 and
cytidine sulfones 15, which lack an acidic proton at
the N3 position, afforded α-alkylated products 20–22 with higher yields (entries 5–7).

c Also isolated was 16b (17%).

The 5-(β-keto)sulfones
also react with disulfides in the
presence of a TEA-trapping electrophilic phenylsulfenyl48 ion. Thus, the treatment of 2′-deoxyuridine-derived
sulfone 12 with phenyl disulfide (2 equiv) in the presence
of TEA in MeCN led to the α-sulfanylation, affording 23 (36%) as a 1:1 mixture of diastereomers (Scheme 3, method A). Analogous treatment of 12 with 4-chlorophenyl disulfide yielded 24 (44%).
Sulfanylation of 12 was also successful with alkyl disulfides
(e.g., MeSSMe), providing alkylsulfanylated product 25 in 40% yield.

Scheme 3 α-Sulfanylation of 5-(β-Keto)sulfones
of 2′-Deoxyuridine
The 5-(β-keto)sulfones can also be α-sulfanylated
by
a sequence of halogenation and nucleophilic substitution reactions.
Thus, the treatment of (β-keto)sulfone 12 with
iodine monochloride/NaOH or iodine in the presence of H2O2/AcOH49 afforded 5-(α-iodo-β-keto)sulfone 26 (35 or 41%) as a 1:1 diastereomeric mixture. Subsequent,
displacement of iodide from 26 with PrSH/TEA gave 5-(2-propanethio-2-tosylacetyl)-2′-deoxyuridine 27 (Scheme 3, method B).

Phosphorylation and Polymerase-Catalyzed
Incorporation into
DNA
The uracil and cytosine nucleosides modified at the C5
position with (β-chlorovinyl)sulfone or (β-keto)sulfone
probes were incorporated into DNA fragments via polymerase-catalyzed
reactions. Phosphorylation of (β-chlorovinyl)sulfone 5 with POCl3 (2.5 equiv; 0 °C, 30 min) in the presence
of proton sponge (2.5 equiv)50 followed
by quenching of the crude reaction mixture with triethylammonium bicarbonate
(TEAB) and purification on a Sephadex column gave 5′-monophosphate 6 (40%; Scheme 4). The reaction of 5 with POCl3 (2.5 equiv)/proton sponge (2.5 equiv) followed by the treatment
with tributylammonium pyrophosphate (TBAPP, 4.2 equiv) and tributylamine
(TBA, 2.7 equiv) afforded 5′-triphosphate 28 after
Sephadex purification. High-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) confirmed
the presence of a (β-chlorovinyl) unit in 28. Subjection
of 2′-deoxyuridine 5-(β-keto)sulfone 12 to
the similar phosphorylation sequence afforded triphosphate 29. Analogous phosphorylation of 2′-deoxycytidine 5-(β-keto)sulfone 14 provided triphosphate 30.

Scheme 4 Synthesis of 5′-Phosphates
of 5-(β-Chlorovinyl) and
5-(β-Keto)sulfones of 2′-Deoxyuridine and 2′-Deoxycytidine
The 2′-deoxyuridine-
and 2′-deoxycytidine-modified
nucleotides 28–30 were incorporated
into double-stranded DNA using a bacterial replication DNA polymerase,
the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I (pol I),51 and a human repair DNA polymerase, DNA polymerase β
(pol β).52 The incorporation into
double-stranded DNA was examined under the conditions that mimic the
situations during both DNA leading and lagging strand syntheses using
an open template substrate and a one-nucleotide gap substrate, respectively
(Figures 2–4). The results showed that pol β was unable
to insert 28 into an open template substrate (Figure 2a, lanes 8–12).
On the other hand, 5 U pol I was able to incorporate 28 and dTTP into this template (Figure 2a, compare lane 13 with lane 7). Interestingly, both
pol β and pol I inserted 28 into the substrate
containing one-nucleotide gap (Figure 2b). It is noteworthy that at a high concentration,
5 U pol I is able to incorporate two nucleotides of 28 by the misincorporation of 28 with a template G. The
results showed that 5-(β-chlorovinyl)sulfone 28 can be incorporated into DNA by replication DNA polymerases during
leading strand DNA synthesis, whereas it can be incorporated in double-stranded
DNA by both replication and repair DNA polymerases during DNA lagging
strand synthesis. The sequences of oligonucleotides for constructing
the substrates for testing the incorporation of 28 are
listed in Table 3.
The DNA substrate constructed by the oligonucleotides is illustrated
below Table 3.

β or pol I at 37 °C for 15 min. In panel a, lanes 2–6
represent the reactions containing 1, 5, 10, 25, and 50 nM pol β
along with 50 μM dTTP, respectively. Lanes 8–12 indicate
the reactions containing various concentrations of pol β (1,
5, 10, 25, and 50 nM) with 50 μM 28. Lanes 7 and

2–7 represent the reactions containing 0.5, 1, 5, 10, 25, and
50 nM pol β along with 50 μM dTTP, respectively. Lanes
9–14 indicate the reactions containing various concentrations
of pol β (0.5, 1, 5, 10, 25, and 50 nM) with 50 μM 28. Lanes 8 and 15 represent the reactions containing 5 U
pol I. Substrates were 32P-labeled at the 5′-end
of the upstream strand and are illustrated above the gels.

Both pol β and pol I incorporated 29 into DNA
open template and one-nucleotide gap substrates (Figure 3). 5 U pol I incorporated same
quantity of 29 as dTTP (Figure 3a,b, lane 15). Again, at the high concentrations,
5 U pol I was able to incorporate two nucleotides of 29. However, the incorporation of 29 by pol β into
the open template substrate increased along with the increasing concentrations
of the enzyme (0.5–50 nM) (Figure 3a, lanes 9–14). For the one-nucleotide
gap substrate, 1.0 nM pol β had already inserted 29 into the DNA (Figure 3b, lane 10), indicating pol β incorporated 29 into
the one-nucleotide gap substrate with a high efficiency. Our results
show that 5-(β-keto)sulfones can be incorporated into double-stranded
DNA more efficiently by repair DNA polymerases than β-(chlorovinyl)sulfones.
They also suggest that it is possible that both 5′-triphosphates
of 5-(β-chlorovinyl)sulfone 28 and 5-(β-keto)sulfone 29, when generated in cells, can be incorporated into genomic
DNA by DNA polymerases during DNA replication and repair.

phosphate 29 into the DNA open template substrate (a)
and one-nucleotide gap substrate (b) by DNA polymerases. Substrates

In both panels, lane 1 represents only substrate; lanes 2–7
represent the reactions containing 0.5, 1, 5, 10, 25, and 50 nM pol
β along with 50 μM dTTP, respectively; lanes 9–14
indicate the reactions containing various concentrations of pol β
(0.5, 1, 5, 10, 25, and 50 nM, respectively) with 50 μM 29; lanes 8 and 15 represent the reactions containing 5 U
pol I. Substrates were 32P-labeled at the 5′-end
of the upstream strand and are illustrated above the gels.

Both pol β and pol I also incorporated 2′-deoxycytidine
5-(β-keto)sulfone phosphate 30 into DNA open template
and one-nucleotide gap substrates (Figure 4). 5 U pol I incorporated
the same quantity of 30 as dCTP (Figure 4a,b, lane 16). However, the incorporation
of 30 by pol β into the open template substrate
increased along with the increasing concentrations of the enzyme (0.5–50
nM; Figure 4a, lanes
10–15). For the one-nucleotide gap substrate, 10 nM pol β
is required to insert 30 into the DNA (Figure 4b, lane 13). The sequences
of oligonucleotides for constructing the substrates for testing the
incorporation of 30 are listed in Table 4. The DNA substrate constructed by the oligonucleotides
is illustrated below Table 4.

(0.5, 1, 5, 10, 25, and 50 nM, respectively) with 50 μM 30; and lanes 8 and 16 represent the reactions containing
5 U pol I. Substrates were 32P-labeled at the 5′-end

In summary, we
have developed two mechanistically different probes
attached to the C5 position of uracil and cytosine nucleosides. The
first 5-(β-chlorovinyl)sulfone probe efficiently reacts with
nucleophiles, such as thiols, at rt in aqueous MeOH solution via the
conjugated addition–elimination pathway. The second 5-(β-keto)sulfone
probe reacts with electrophiles such as alkyl halides or aryl/alkyl
disulfides. These nucleosides with reactive β-chlorovinyl and
β-keto sulfone groups were converted into their 5′-triphosphates
and were efficiently incorporated into double-stranded DNA using open
and one-nucleotide gap substrates by human or E. coli DNA-polymerase-catalyzed reactions. Our results also suggest that
if 5-(β-chlorovinyl)sulfone and 5-(β-keto)sulfone 5′-triphosphates
are generated in cells, they could be incorporated into genomic DNA
by DNA polymerases during DNA replication and repair.

Incorporation of 5-Modified Nucleotides into
DNA: Materials
of Enzymatic Reactions
All DNA oligonucleotides were synthesized
by the Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT; Coralville, IA). The radionucleotide
[γ-32P]ATP (6000 mCi/mmol) was purchased from MP
Biomedicals (Santa Ana, CA). T4 polynucleotide kinase and deoxynucleoside
5′-triphosphates were purchased from Thermo Scientific (Pittsburgh,
PA). Micro Bio-Spin TM 6 Columns were purchased from Bio-Rad (Hercules,
CA). All other chemicals were purchased from Thermo Scientific (Pittsburgh,
PA) and Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). Purified human DNA polymerase
β (pol β) was purified following the procedures described
previously.54,55 The Klenow fragment was obtained
from New England Biolabs (Ipswitch, MA).

Oligonucleotide Substrates
Substrates with an upstream
primer annealed to the template strand were designated as open template
substrates. The substrates were constructed by annealing an upstream
primer (31 or 30 nt) with the template strand (71 or 49 nt) at a molar
ratio of 1:3. The substrate containing one-nucleotide gap was made
by annealing an upstream primer and a downstream primer with the template
strand at the molar ratio of 1:3:3. The open template and one-nucleotide
gap substrates were employed to mimic the intermediates formed during
DNA replication. The sequences of oligonucleotides for constructing
the substrates are listed in Tables 3 and 4.

Enzymatic Activity Assay
Nucleotide incorporation by
DNA polymerases was performed by incubating different concentrations
of pol β or 5 U Klenow fragment with 25 nM 32P-labeled
substrates at 37 °C for 15 min according to a method described
previously.50,51 The enzymatic reactions were
assembled in the presence of triphosphates of 5-(β-chlorovinyl)sulfone
of dU 28 (50 μM), 5-(β-keto)sulfone of dU 29 (50 μM), or 5-(β-keto)sulfone of dC 30. This allows us to examine if 28, 29,
or 30 can be directly incorporated into a double-stranded
DNA during DNA leading and lagging strand maturation. DNA synthesis
was separated in a 15% urea denaturing polyacrylamide gel and the
synthesized products were detected by a Pharos FX Plus PhosphorImager
(Bio-Rad Laboratory, CA).
