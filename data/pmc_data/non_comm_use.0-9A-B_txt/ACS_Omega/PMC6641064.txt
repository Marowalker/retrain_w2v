In this study, we report organic
solar cells (OSCs) fabricated
by a polymer-small molecule: the fullerene ternary active layer. It
is found that a significantly enhanced power conversion efficiency
contributed to the enhanced short-circuit current density and fill
factor (FF). Investigation of absorption spectra and external quantum
efficiency spectra indicate that the enhancement in photocurrent originates
from the improved light absorption attributed to the small molecule.
Further investigations by grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering,
transmission electron microscopy, and atomic force microscopy reveal
that charge transport within the ternary active layer is facilitated
by a reduced π–π distance between the adjacent
polymer chains along the out-of-plane direction, good miscibilities
between ternary components, and the rougher surface of the resultant
thin film. As a result, the hole mobility of the polymer electron
donor and electron mobility of the fullerene electron acceptor are
considerably increased, resulting in enhanced FFs. Our studies provide
a facile route to realize efficient OSCs.

1 Introduction
Organic solar cells (OSCs)
are described as a promising approach
for renewable energy generation and have gained intense attention
due to their potential in large-area manufacturing by low-cost solution
methods.1−3 Typically, OSCs are composed of polymers (or small
molecules)/fullerene bulk heterojunction (BHJ) composite, where the
BHJ composite as an active layer is sandwiched between the anode and
cathode. To realize efficient OSCs, many stratagems have been employed.4−10 The key idea behind them is to take full advantage of the solar
spectrum. Thus, two or more active layers are serially connected,
and OSCs with multijunction structures are developed. Recently, over
11% PCEs from multijunction OSCs were realized.11,12 However, the fabrication and structure design of the multijunction
OSCs are tricky.13,14 Alternatively, special efforts
were paid to the structural modifications of polymers or small molecules
to boost light harvest and charge generation. Over 10% PCEs from single-junction
OSCs were reported.15−19 Nevertheless, light harvest by the thin active layer is limited
by its thickness due to the trade-off correlation between charge generation
and charge extraction.20−22 To circumvent these issues, the introduction of another
electron donor material into the BHJ composite, possessing complimentary
light absorption, was postulated and proved to be a facile approach.23−30 These BHJ composites based on three components were termed as a
ternary active layer.

Efficient OSCs with a ternary active layer
require complimentary
light absorption between two electron donor materials. The added electron
donor material has appropriate energy levels to function as a cascade
for charge generation and transportation and good miscibilities between
the ternary composites. Despite the simple concepts, optimization
of the ternary active layer is difficult and complex,31 involving weight balance between the three components,
solvent selections, and concentrations of processing additives.

In this study, we introduce a small molecule, 7,7′-(4,4-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-4H-silolo[3,2-b:4,5-b]-dithiophene-2,6-diyl)bis(6-fluoro-4-(5′-hexyl-[2,2′-bithiophen]-5-yl)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole)32 (simplified
as DTS) into poly[[4,8-bis[(2-ethylhexyl)oxy]benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′] dithiophene-2,6-diyl][3-fluoro-2-[(2-ethylhexyl)carbonyl]thieno[3,4-b]-thiophenediyl]](PTB7)/[6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric
acid methyl ester (PC71BM) BHJ composite for fabricating
OSCs. OSCs fabricated by the PTB7:DTS/PC71BM BHJ thin film
exhibit a significantly enhanced short-circuit current (JSC) and fill factor (FF), with a corresponding enhanced
PCE of 8.88%, which is more than 16% enhancement as compared to that
(7.64%) of OSCs fabricated by the PTB7/PC71BM BHJ thin
film. Investigation shows that DTS has complimentary light absorption
with PTB7 in the visible range, and the photo-to-electron conversion
efficiency within the OSCs with the ternary active layer is greatly
increased. Further investigation indicates that the ternary components
have a moderated phase separation and reduced π–π
distance along the out-of-plane direction. Moreover, DTS not only
improves the hole mobility of PTB7 and the electron mobility of PC71BM but also provides balanced charge carrier mobilities within
the ternary active layer, leading to the enhanced FF. Our studies
provide a facile route to realize efficient OSCs.

2 Results and Discussion
To investigate the photovoltaic performances
of OSCs based on the
PTB7:DTS/PC71BM thin films, a series of active layers are
employed, where the weight ratio of PTB7/PC71BM is kept
at 1:1.5 and the weight content of DTS is tuned from 0 to 16.7 wt
%. In addition, the volume ratio of the 1,8-diiodoctane (DIO) additive
in chlorobenzene (CB) is tuned from 0.5 to 1 to 3% for optimizing
the OSC photovoltaic performances. Figure 1a shows the current density versus voltage
(J–V) characteristics of
OSCs fabricated by PTB7/PC71BM, DTS/PC71BM,
and the optimized PTB7:DTS/PC71BM thin films. The device
performance parameters are summarized in Table 1. OSCs fabricated by the PTB7/PC71BM thin film exhibit a JSC of 15.78 mA
cm–2, an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.72 V, an FF of 67.25%, with a corresponding PCE
of 7.64%. OSCs fabricated by the DTS/PC71BM thin film exhibit
a JSC of 11.63 mA cm–2, a VOC of 0.79 V, an FF of 65.84%, with
a corresponding PCE of 6.05%. All of these results are consistent
with the values reported in the previous studies.33,34 However, it is found that the OSCs fabricated by the PTB7:DTS/PC71BM thin films present increased PCEs as DTS is added into
the PTB7/PC71BM active layers. In particular, OSCs fabricated
by the PTB7:DTS/PC71BM thin film, where the weight ratio
of PTB7 to DTS is 18:3:27 and the PTB7:DTS/PC71BM thin
film is processed from a solution with 1% DIO, shows a significantly
increased JSC of 17.79 mA cm–2 and Voc of 0.72 V and a greatly improved
FF of 69.38%, consequently, a remarkably enhanced PCE of 8.88% is
observed, which is more than 16% enhanced as compared to that of OSC’s
fabricated by the PTB7/PC71BM thin film. Moreover, it is
also found that the greatly enhanced device performances mainly result
from the significantly increased JSC.

On the other hand,
it is found that there is an apparent mutual
compensation between DIO and DTS. Utilization of small amounts of
DTS in PTB7:PC71BM could function as a substitution of
DIO,35 as the PTB7:DTS/PC71BM
thin film is prepared from a CB solution with 0.5% DIO, and OSCs fabricated
by the PTB7:DTS/PC71BM thin film with a weight ratio of
18:3:27 exhibit the best PCE; likewise, the best PCE is observed in
OSCs fabricated by the PTB7:DTS/PC71BM (18:2:27) thin film,
which is processed from a CB solution with 1% DIO. Whereas, the best
PCE is observed in OSCs fabricated by the PTB7:DTS/PC71BM (18:1:27) thin film that is processed from a CB solution with
3% DIO.

According to the J–V characteristics
of OSCs, it is estimated that OSCs fabricated by the PTB7:DTS/PC71BM thin film only possess a low series resistance (RS) of 4.39 Ω cm2; in contrast,
OSCs fabricated by the PTB7/PC71BM thin film possess a
higher RS of 6.72 Ω cm2. These results indicate that the improved JSC contributes to the reduced resistance of the devices. Thus,
the introduction of the small molecule DTS into the PTB7/PC71BM binary active layer would greatly improve the PCEs of OSCs.

To study the strikingly increased JSC and improved PCE, the EQE spectra of the OSCs fabricated by the
PTB7/PC71BM thin film and PTB7:DTS/PC71BM thin
film are measured. The results are displayed in Figure 1b. Both OSCs have strong and broad responses
in wavelengths ranging from 360 to 740 nm. Besides, it is observed
that the OSCs fabricated by the PTB7:DTS/PC71BM thin film
have enhanced EQE responses ranging from 350 to 700 nm as compared
with those of the OSCs fabricated by the PTB7/PC71BM thin
film. These results suggest that the improved JSC and PCE of the OSCs fabricated by the PTB7:DTS/PC71BM thin film are originated from the improved photo-to-electron conversions
in the visible range, which probably contributes to the charge carrier
generation and transportation within DTS. To confirm this, the band
alignment of the materials used for fabrication of the OSCs by the
PTB7:DTS/PC71BM thin film is shown in Scheme 1b. The highest occupied molecular
orbital and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital energy levels of DTS
are −3.3 and −5.2 eV,34 which
are between the corresponding energy levels (−3.3 and −5.1
eV) of PTB7 and those of PC71BM, respectively. Therefore,
DTS will not only work as an electron donor but also as a cascade
in the energy level alignment.

To further investigate
the improved JSC of the OSCs fabricated
by the PTB7:DTS/PC71BM thin film,
UV–visible absorption spectra of the PTB7, PC71BM,
DTS, PTB7/PC71BM, DTS/PC71BM, and PTB7:DTS/PC71BM thin films are measured and the results are shown in Figure 2. Both PTB7 and DTS
possess strong light absorption ranging from 500 to 700 nm because
they possess high molar extinction coefficients.36,37 However, the DTS thin film presents an overwhelming light absorption
ranging from 320 to 460 nm as compared to that from the PTB7 thin
film. Therefore, DTS can work complimentary to PTB7 for light absorption
as it is introduced into the PTB7:DTS/PC71BM active layer.
As a result, absorption of the PTB7:DTS/PC71BM thin film
is significantly enhanced, covering the entire visible spectrum. These
results further indicate that the greatly enhanced JSC and EQE are attributed to the increased light absorption
of the PTB7:DTS/PC71BM thin film.

PTB7/PC71BM, DTS/PC71BM, and PTB7:DTS/PC71BM thin films. (The thin-film
thicknesses of each species and mixture are ca. 70 and 100 nm.)

Thin film morphology, including
the molecular-packing orientation,
size scale of phase separation, miscibility of the components, and
distribution of the components within the active layer, have been
identified as the key factors in determining device performance of
the OSCs.38−40 The effects of the introduction of DTS in the active
layer on molecular packing, film morphology, and phase separation
are investigated. A tapping-mode atom force microscope (AFM) is employed
to study the nanoscale surface morphology. The height and phase images
of the PTB7/PC71BM and PTB7:DTS/PC71BM thin
films are shown in Figure 3. It is found that the addition of DTS increases the roughness
of the PTB7:DTS/PC71BM thin film, which possesses a root-mean-square
height of 1.68 nm as compared to 1.39 nm for the PTB7/PC71BM thin film. It was postulated that a rougher surface of the active
layer could provide a larger metal–active layer interface,
resulting in efficient charge collection,34 and consequently an increased JSC and
PCE of the OSCs.

film and (c) PTB7:DTS/PC71BM thin film; phase images of
(b) PTB7/PC71BM thin film and (d) PTB7:DTS/PC71BM thin film.

Transmission electron
microscopy (TEM) is carried out to study
the effects of DTS on phase separation of the active layer. The results
are shown in Figure 4. The dark areas are attributed to PC71BM-rich domains
because the electron scattering density of PC71BM is much
higher than that of polymer or small molecule. It is observed that
introducing DTS into the PTB7/PC71BM thin film does not
give rise to significant changes in the phase separation, which suggests
that there is a good miscibility between DTS, PTB7, and PC71BM. As a result, the PTB7:DTS/PC71BM thin film possesses
a good interpenetrating network, with a characteristic size scale
of ∼10 nm.41 The characteristic
size scale within this range is favorable for high exciton dissociation
efficiency, thus leading to an optimized device performance.

The two-dimensional (2D)
grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering
(GIWAXS) patterns of the PTB7/PC71BM and PTB7:DTS/PC71BM thin films are shown in Figure 5a,b. It is obvious that the addition of DTS
affects the molecular packing of the PTB7 thin film. Figure 5c,d presents the one-dimensional
(1D) GIWAXS patterns of the thin films along the in-plane direction
(qy) and out-of-plane direction (qz). The different positions of the Bragg peaks
along the in-plane direction (qy) and
out-of-plane direction (qz) suggest isotropic
packing stratagems of the polymer chains. From the position of the
Bragg peak, the distance between adjacent PTB7 units along the π–π
conjugation direction can be estimated. The structural parameters
of thin films are summarized in Table 2. It is further found that an addition of DTS has impressive
impacts on the molecular packing of the PTB7 thin film. The π–π
distance along the in-plane direction is reduced from 4.80 to 4.72
Å. Moreover, the π–π distance along the out-of-plane
direction is considerably reduced from 4.72 to 4.59 Å. It is
noted that the photocurrent generated in OSCs is transported along
the out-of-plane direction. Therefore, the greatly reduced π–π
distance along the out-of-plane direction would facilitate the charge
transport properties of the active layer.42−44 Thus, significantly
improved JSC and FF are obtained from
OSCs fabricated by the PTB7:DTS/PC71BM thin film.

To further study the
influences of DTS on JSC and PCE of OSCs,
the hole mobility of PTB7 and electron
mobility of PC71BM in the active layers estimated on the
basis of the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) method, followed
the Mott–Gurney square law:45,46, where ε0 is the permittivity
of free space, εr is the dielectric constant of the
polymer, which is assumed as 3, L is the thickness
of the active layer, μ is the carrier mobility. Figure 6 shows the J1/2–V curves of the hole-only
diode, with a device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/MoO3/Al, and the electron-only diode, with a device structure
of ITO/Al/active layer/Ca/Al, where the active layers are PTB7/PC71BM, DTS/PC71BM, and PTB7:DTS/PC71BM
thin films. The hole mobility of PTB7 within the PTB7/PC71BM thin film is estimated to be 3.94 × 10–3 cm2 V–1 s–1 and the
electron mobility of PC71BM within the PTB7/PC71BM thin film is estimated to be 1.25 × 10–4 cm2 V–1 s–1, respectively,
as given in Table 3. As DTS is introduced into the PTB7/PC71BM thin film,
the hole mobility of PTB7 is estimated to be to 5.57 × 10–3 cm2 V–1 s–1 and the electron mobility of PC71BM is estimated to be
1.83 × 10–4 cm2 V–1 s–1, respectively. It is also found that the ratio
of the hole mobility to the electron mobility is decreased from 31.5
for the PTB7/PC71BM thin film to 30.4 for the PTB7:DTS/PC71BM thin film. Thus, an addition of DTS also can slightly
balance the hole mobility of PTB7 and the electron mobility of PC71BM. As a result, a weak enlarged FF is observed from OSCs
fabricated by the PTB7:DTS/PC71BM thin film.

3 Conclusions
In summary, we demonstrated
that the OSCs fabricated by the PTB7:DTS/PC71BM thin film
exhibit a significantly enhanced PCE of 8.88%.
It was found that the greatly increased PCE contributed to the enhanced JSC and FF. Investigation of absorption spectra
and EQE spectra indicated that the enhancement in JSC was originated from the improved light absorption.
Further, investigations by GIWAXS, TEM, and AFM demonstrated that
the charge transport within the PTB7:DTS/PC71BM thin film
was facilitated due to the reduced π–π distance
between the adjacent polymer chains along the out-of-plane direction
and good miscibility of DTS in the composite. As a result, an enlarged
JSC is observed from the OSCs fabricated by the PTB7:DTS/PC71BM thin film. Moreover, the hole mobility of PTB7 and electron
mobility of PC71BM were considerably increased, resulting
in balanced charge carrier mobilities and consequently an enlarged
FF. Our studies provided a facile route to realize efficient OSCs.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials
PTB7,
PC71BM,
and DTS were purchased from 1-Material Inc. and used as received.
Poly[(9,9-bis(3′-(N,N-dimethylamino)propyl)-2,7-fluorene)-alt-2,7-(9,9-dioctylfluorene)] (PFN) was synthesized in
our lab.47 The molecular structures of
PTB7, DTS, PC71BM, and PFN are shown in Scheme 1. The poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate)
PEDOT:PSS (Clevios HTL Solar) was purchased from Heraeus and used
as received.

4.2 Thin-Film Characterizations
The PTB7,
DTS, PC71BM, and their composite thin films were spin cast
from CB with 1% v/v DIO solutions onto quartz glass. The thickness
of the thin film is measured by the surface profilometer (Tencor,
α-500). UV–vis absorption spectra of thin films were
measured by an HP8453 spectrophotometer. The GIWAXS patterns of the
PTB7/PC71BM and PTB7:DTS/PC71BM thin films were
measured in a beamline 8-ID-E, Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National
Laboratory. TEM images of the PTB7/PC71BM and PTB7:DTS/PC71BM thin films were captured by a JEOL TEM using an accelerating
voltage of 120 kV. AFM images of the PTB7/PC71BM and the
PTB7:DTS/PC71BM thin films were taken on a Nanoscope NS3A
system (Digital Instrument).

4.3 Mobility Measurement
The SCLC method
used to estimate the hole mobility of PTB7 within the PTB7/PC71BM and PTB7:DTS/PC71BM thin films and the electron
mobility of PC71BM within the PTB7/PC71BM and
PTB7:DTS/PC71BM thin films,48 followed the Mott–Gurney square law: , where
ε0 is the permittivity
of free space, εr is the dielectric constant of the
polymer, which is assumed as 3, L is the thickness
of active layer, μ is the carrier mobility. The hole-only diode
with a device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/MoO3/Al and the electron-only diode with a device structure of ITO/Al/active
layer/Ca/Al were fabricated, respectively, where ITO is indium tin
oxide, the active layers are the PTB7/PC71BM and PTB7:DTS/PC71BM thin films, MoO3 is molybdenum oxide, Ca is
calcium and Al is aluminum. The active layers were deposited using
the same method as that for OSC fabrication. Ca with a thickness of
10 nm and Al with a thickness of 90 nm were deposited onto the active
layers in the vacuum system with a base pressure of 2.0 × 10–6 mbar through a shadow mask. The active area of the
device is measured to be 16 mm2.

4.4 OSCs
Fabrication and Characterizations
OSCs with a device structure
of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/PFN/Al
(as shown in Scheme 1a) were fabricated and characterized. The ITO substrates were cleaned
in an ultrasonic bath with acetone, detergent, de-ionized water, and
isopropanol, subsequently. After being dried in an oven overnight,
the pre-cleaned ITO substrates were treated in a UV-ozone incubator.
Then, PEDOT:PSS thin films with a thickness of around 40 nm were deposited
atop the ITO substrates, followed by thermal annealing at 150 °C
for 15 min. The active layers of the PTB7:DTS/PC71BM and
PTB7/PC71BM thin films were deposited atop the PEDOT/PSS
thin film from corresponding solutions (where CB mixed with DIO was
used as the co-solvent, and the volume ratio of DIO was adjustable).
After the active layers were dried for over 5 h at room temperature
under vacuum, an ultrathin film of PFN with a thickness of ∼5
nm was spin cast onto the top of the active layers from its corresponding
solution. Finally, 100 nm of Al was thermally deposited through a
shadow mask in a vacuum chamber with a base pressure of 2.0 ×
10–6 mbar. The active area of the device is measured
to be 16 mm2.

The current density versus voltage
(J–V) characteristics of
OSCs were measured by a Keithley 2400 source meter under AM 1.5 G
spectrum from a class solar simulator (SAN-EI, XES-40S1, Japan) with
the light intensity of 100 mW/cm2. The light intensity
was calibrated by a Newport-certified reference silicon cell (PV Measurements,
with KG-5 visible filter). A spectral mismatch factor (M) value of 1.03 was used to obtain real photocurrents and efficiencies
of the devices according to the previous report.49 The thicknesses of the active layers were measured by a
surface profilometer (Tencor, α-500). The EQE spectra of the
OSCs were measured on a DSR100UV-B spectrometer with a bromine tungsten
light source, an SR830 lock-in amplifier, and a calibrated Si detector.
