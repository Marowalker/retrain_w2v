Resistive-based gas sensors have
been considered as the most favorable
gas sensors for detection of toxic gases and volatile organic compounds
(VOCs) because of their simple structure, low cost, high sensitivity,
ease of use, and high stability. Unfortunately, wide application of
resistive-based gas sensors is limited by their low selectivity. In
this article, we present the fabrication of ultrahigh selective NH3 gas sensor based on tin–titanium dioxide/reduced graphene/carbon
nanotube (Sn–TiO2@rGO/CNT) nanocomposites. The Sn–TiO2@rGO/CNT nanocomposites with different molar ratios of Sn/Ti
(1:10, 3:10, and 5:10) were synthesized via the solvothermal method.
Characterizations by scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron
microscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy confirmed the decoration
of Sn–TiO2 nanoparticles on rGO/CNT nanocomposite
surfaces. The Sn–TiO2@rGO/CNT nanocomposite gas
sensor exhibited high response and ultrahigh selectivity to NH3 against toluene, dimethylformamide, acetone, ethanol, methanol,
isopropanol, formaldehyde, hydrogen, carbon dioxide, acetylene, and
VOCs in paint thinners at room temperature. The Sn–TiO2@rGO/CNT nanocomposite gas sensor with molar ratio of Sn/Ti
= 1:10 showed the highest response to NH3 over other molar
ratios of Sn/Ti as well as pure rGO/CNT and Sn–TiO2 gas sensors. The ammonia-sensing mechanisms of the Sn–TiO2@rGO/CNT gas sensor were proposed based on the formation of
p–n heterojunctions of p-type rGO/CNT and n-type Sn–TiO2 nanoparticles via a low-temperature oxidizing reaction process.

1 Introduction
Ammonia
(NH3) is one of the toxic gases that can cause
illness or death when it is inhaled or absorbed by eyes, nose, skin,
and the respiratory tract at high concentration.1 NH3 has been widely used in several commercial
products and industrial applications such as ice factory, adhesives,
rubber cements, automotive fuels, and laboratory solvents.2−4 Moreover, NH3 is also found in the exhaled breath of
humans, in which it plays an important biomarker for diagnosis of
kidney disorders or ulcers caused by the Helicobacter
pylori bacterial stomach infection.5,6 The
exhaled breath of patients with kidney disorders and peptic ulcer
releases NH3 in the concentration range of 0.82–14.7
ppm.7 Furthermore, NH3 is produced
from farming areas or animal agriculture that can affect health of
humans, animals, and environment.8 Therefore,
detection of NH3 is necessary for life saving, environment
protection, and medical applications. Nowadays, sensing nanomaterials
and fabrication techniques for NH3 gas sensors have been
extensively studied in term of high sensitivity, high selectivity,
high stability, fast response, low cost, and ease of use. Metal oxides
are one of the most popular NH3-sensing nanomaterials.
However, most NH3 gas sensors based on metal oxides require
high working temperatures of 150–300 °C and exhibit cross-sensitivity.9,10 The development of room-temperature NH3 gas sensors based
on nanocomposites11−14 is a way to overcome these crucial problems but until now no nanocomposites
exhibited perfect selectivity to NH3, leading to impractical
use in real-world applications based on single gas detection with
quantitative purpose.

A nanocomposite is defined as a multicomponent
material in which
at least one of components are of nanoscale size. It generally comprises
multiphase inorganic/organic materials such as metal–metal
oxides (Ni60Fe30Mn10, Sn/Cu/ZnO NPs,
MoS2–Au, MoS2/ZnO, and Cu–BTC/BNNT),15−19 metal oxide–carbon nanomaterials (TiO2–RGO,
CoFe2O4/graphene, and rGO/MoS2),20−22 metal oxide–polymer (Pd–TiO2@PPy, PANI/SnO2, and PPy/Fe2O3),23,24 and metal oxide–carbon nanomaterials–polymer (Pd–PANI–rGO,
TiO2@PPy–GN, graphene–PEDOT:PSS, and Pt/PAN–MWCNTs/WGE).25−28 Among them, the hybrid carbon-based nanostructures have become one
of the most attractive materials that can provide multidisciplinary
applications, including flexible battery, biosensor, solar cell, super-capacitors,
chemical sensor, and gas sensing,29−31 due to their unique
properties such as low-cost production, strong covalent-bond structures,
large specific surface area, high electrical conductivity, low redox
potential, and high mechanical strength.32−34 In this work,
we focus on new metal oxide–carbon nanocomposites consisting
of tin–titanium dioxide/reduced graphene/carbon nanotube (Sn–TiO2@rGO/CNT) for NH3-sensing application at room temperature.
The Sn–TiO2@rGO/CNT nanocomposites were synthesized
by the solvothermal process and characterized via scanning electron
microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and X-ray
photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The sensing performances of Sn–TiO2@rGO/CNT nanocomposites were systematically investigated.
The NH3-sensing mechanism was proposed based on the formation
of p–n heterojunctions.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Characterization of Sensing Films
The SEM image of
Sn–TiO2@rGO/CNT nanocomposite
is shown in Figure 1a. It illustrates agglomeration of rGO and CNT leading to self-assembled
3D hierarchical interconnected morphology, whereas the Sn–TiO2 nanoparticles are randomly embedded on the surface of the
rGO/CNT nanocomposite. The corresponding TEM image confirms the coexistence
of Sn–TiO2 nanoparticles, graphene, and CNTs as
demonstrated in Figure 1b. It can be seen that the Sn–TiO2 nanoparticles
with diameters of <15 nm are widely coated on graphene and CNT
surfaces.

Figure 1 (a) SEM and (b) TEM images of Sn–TiO2@rGO/CNT
nanocomposite.

XPS survey scan measurements were
performed to investigate the
chemical composition of the Sn–TiO2@rGO/CNT nanocomposite
as illustrated in Figure 2. The survey scan XPS spectra of Sn–TiO2@rGO/CNT with different molar ratios of Sn/Ti confirm the presence
of C, Ti, Sn, and O in agreement with the expected chemical compositions
of the Sn–TiO2@rGO/CNT nanocomposite. The Sn atomic
contents of Sn–TiO2@rGO/CNT nanocomposites were
calculated from the XPS data to be around 2.9, 3.8, and 5.4 at. %
for nanocomposite I, nanocomposite II, and nanocomposite III, respectively.
It can be seen that the Sn adding amounts increase approximately linearly
with increasing Sn in TiO2@rGO/CNT based on solvothermal
method. In addition, all element atomic contents of nanocomposite
I were found to be around C 1s (40.7 at. %), Ti (12.6 at. %), Sn (2.9
at. %), and O 1s (43.8 at. %).

Figure 2 XPS survey scan spectra of Sn–TiO2@rGO/CNT nanocomposite.

The high-resolution C 1s peak (Figure 3a) can be deconvoluted into five peaks located
at 283.3, 284.8, 286.1, 286.9 and 288.6 eV which correspond to C=C,
C–C, C–OH, C–O, and COOH groups in rGO/CNT, respectively.35−40 The C=C and C–C components refer to the backbone of
the rGO/CNT structure, whereas the C–OH, C–O, and COOH
bonds indicate the oxygen-containing functional groups. It can be
seen that the C=C and C–C bonds have higher intensity
than the oxygen-containing functional groups of C–OH, C–O,
and COOH bonds. XPS spectra of Sn 3d and Ti 2p in nanocomposite I
are presented in Figure 3b,c, respectively. Two peaks of Sn 3d spectrum at 486.6 and 495.0
eV are attributable to Sn 3d5/2 and Sn 3d3/2 spin orbit peaks of the Sn4+ state in SnO2, confirming the formation of SnO2 nanoparticles in the
Sn–TiO2@rGO/CNT nanocomposite.41,42 For Ti 2p spectrum, two spin–orbit peaks of Ti 2p3/2 and Ti 2p1/2 are located at 458.8 and 464.5 eV, respectively.
The two prominent peaks can be assigned to the Ti4+ state
of TiO2.41,43 The high-resolution O 1s XPS
spectrum of the nanocomposite I is shown in Figure 3d, the O 1s peak can be decomposed into four
contributions centered at 529.9, 531.1, 531.9 and 532.9 eV, which
can be attributed to O–metal (Sn, Ti) bonding,44−46 Sn–O–C or Ti–O–C,47,48 Sn–OH or Ti–OH,49 and C–OH/C–O–C,50 respectively.

2.2 Gas Sensing Properties
Figure 4a shows the change in resistance
of the nanocomposite I gas sensor upon exposure to NH3 vapor
with different concentrations ranging from 25 to 250 ppm at room temperature.
It is seen that the Sn–TiO2@rGO/CNT gas sensor exhibits
a rapid decrease of resistance upon exposure to NH3 vapor
before recovering to their baseline values in dry air. The resistance
changing behaviors may be attributed to the adsorption and desorption
of NH3 molecules of the sensing films. The details of sensing
mechanism for the Sn–TiO2@rGO/CNT gas sensor will
be discussed in the next section. The nanocomposite I gas sensor has
been further tested to evaluate reproducibility under exposure to
250 ppm NH3 vapor at room temperature as demonstrated in Figure 4b. It demonstrates
that the Sn–TiO2@rGO/CNT gas sensor can fully recover
to their initial baselines for several repeated cycles. Consequently,
the Sn–TiO2@rGO/CNT gas sensor indicates its good
reproducibility for NH3 detection at room temperature.
The stability of the Sn–TiO2@rGO/CNT nanocomposite
gas sensor has been investigated with exposure to 250 ppm ammonia
for 30 days. Based on storage of gas sensor at room temperature with
uncontrolled relative humidity (RH), a slight gas response drop (only
about 3%) could be observed after 30 days (see Figure S1 in the Supporting Information). It indicates that the
Sn–TiO2@rGO/CNT nanocomposite gas sensor exhibits
good stability over 30 days.

Figure 4 Changes in resistance of (a) nanocomposite I
gas sensors to ammonia
vapor with various concentrations and (b) four repeated pulses of
250 ppm ammonia at room temperature. (c) Gas responses of nanocomposite
I gas sensor to ammonia vapor with various concentrations. (d) Gas
responses of nanocomposite I to 250 ppm ammonia vapor at room temperature
compared with nanocomposite II, nanocomposite III, and TiO2@rGO/CNT gas sensors.

The nanocomposite I gas
sensor as a function of NH3 concentration
at room temperature is shown in Figure 4c. It can be seen that the gas response increases exponentially
over the NH3 concentration range of 25–250 ppm.
The gas responses of the nanocomposite I gas sensor at 25, 50, 100,
150, 200, and 250 ppm NH3 are 17.0, 19.1, 30.6, 42.0, 65.2
and 85.9%, respectively. The gas response as functions of NH3 concentration (CNH3) can
be fitted by a power law function relation according to the equation:  with
a good correlation coefficient (0.995).
The calculated response and recovery times of the nanocomposite I
gas sensor for detection of 250 ppm NH3 are 99 and 66 s,
respectively, which are relatively short for a room-temperature sensor.

The effect of different molar ratios of Sn/Ti on the gas response
toward 250 ppm NH3 vapor at room temperature was investigated
as shown in Figure 4d. It can be observed that the gas response increases from 18.5 to
85.9% after adding Sn/SnO2 to TiO2@rGO/CNT nanocomposites.
However, more Sn/SnO2-loading contents into the TiO2@rGO/CNT nanocomposites (nanocomposite II and nanocomposite
III) exhibit a decrease in response. Thus, nanocomposite I is the
optimal condition of the Sn–TiO2@rGO/CNT gas sensor
that yields the highest NH3 response at room temperature.
The observed results may be explained based on the formation of p–n
heterojunctions. The gas response of the nanocomposite sensor has
been improved after adding Sn/SnO2 due to the increasing
number of Sn/SnO2 nanoparticles corresponding to the number
of p–n heterojunctions on the surfaces. The increasing number
of Sn/SnO2 nanoparticles on TiO2@rGO/CNT surfaces
may enlarge the specific surface area of the sensing film to absorb
more oxygen molecules on the sensing film surface and increase the
interface of p–n heterojunction. When the Sn/SnO2 loading amount becomes too high, the Sn/SnO2 molecules
may aggregate into larger nanoparticles or cover the active centers
of the nanocomposite, leading to a reduced number of p–n heterojunctions,
causing a lower response. To distinguish the performance contribution
of each ingredient within the nanocomposites, rGO/CNT and Sn–TiO2 gas sensors were fabricated and tested toward 250 ppm NH3 at room temperature (see Figure S2 in the Supporting Information). One can observe that the initial
resistances of the rGO/CNT and Sn–TiO2 gas sensors
are too low and too high, respectively, whereas the resistance of
the Sn–TiO2@rGO/CNT sensor is between the resistance
of rGO/CNT and Sn–TiO2 sensors. The resistance of
the rGO/CNT sensor increases and Sn–TiO2 sensor
resistance decreases in the present of NH3 according to
p-type and n-type characteristics, respectively. The gas responses
of the rGO/CNT sensor and Sn–TiO2 are calculated
to be 30.0 and 28.8%, respectively. These results confirm the benefit
of p–n heterojunction formation that gives better gas responses
than pure p-type or n-type materials, that is over 55% for sensing
NH3 at room temperature.

The selectivity of the optimal
Sn–TiO2@rGO/CNT
gas sensor has been characterized toward various gases including toluene
(C7H8), dimethylformamide (DMF), acetone (C3H6O), ammonia (NH3), ethanol (C2H6O), methanol (CH3OH), isopropanol
(C3H8O), formaldehyde (CH2O), thinner,
hydrogen (H2), carbon dioxide (CO2), and acetylene
(C2H2) at concentrations as shown in Figure 5. It can be seen
that the optimal Sn–TiO2@rGO/CNT gas sensor exhibits
ultrahigh selective NH3 over several tested gases at room
temperature. The high selectivity toward NH3 may be related
to the interaction between polarity of NH3 molecules and
hydroxyl groups on the Sn–TiO2 surface leading to
strong chemisorptions, whereas it is too difficult for other tested
gases to form hydrogen bonds with these hydroxyl groups on the Sn–TiO2 surface at room temperature.51 Moreover, NH3 molecules were favorable to promoting molecular
adsorption on the surface acidity of Sn–TiO2 existing
Lewis acid sites (Sn4+ and Ti4+) and Brønsted
acid sites (Sn–OH and Ti–OH).52 To investigate the humidity effect, the resistance of the Sn–TiO2@rGO/CNT sensor was measured in real time at various humidity
levels from 30 to 90% RH (see Figure S3 in the Supporting Information). It is seen that the sensor resistance
does not change significantly in the range of 30–70% RH at
room temperature. At high humidity level (RH > 70%), the sensor
resistance
decreases with increasing RH. However, when humidity response of the
Sn–TiO2@rGO/CNT sensor (defined as [R30%RH – RX] ×
100/R30%RH, where R30%RH and RX are the sensor resistance
values at 30% RH and the target value at another RH, respectively)
is calculated, the sensor exhibits only 13.8% at 90% RH that is lower
than the NH3 gas response for all tested NH3 concentrations (25–250 ppm). Thus, it can confirm the humidity-independent
sensor for normal living condition. Moreover, the NH3-sensing
performance of the optimal Sn–TiO2@rGO/CNT gas sensor
in this study is superior to other recent reports of room-temperature
NH3 as listed in Table 1.

2.3 Sensing Mechanism of Sn–TiO2@rGO/CNT Nanocomposite Gas Sensor
From the results, the
resistance changing behaviors may be attributed to the adsorption
and desorption of NH3 molecules on the Sn–TiO2@rGO/CNT nanocomposite sensing film. The NH3-sensing
mechanisms of the Sn–TiO2@rGO/CNT nanocomposite
gas sensor at room temperature may be explained based on the formation
of p–n heterojunctions between p-type rGO/CNT and n-type metal–oxide–semiconductor
(MOS) of Sn–TiO2.62−64 In air, oxygen species
(O2–) chemisorbed on the surface of Sn–TiO2@rGO/CNT nanocomposite film will capture free electrons from
the conduction band of Sn–TiO2 and the Fermi level
of rGO/CNT according to the surface reaction: (1) O2 (ads)
+ e– → O2– (ads),
leading to the formation of surface depletion layers on the interface
of the Sn–TiO2@rGO/CNT sensing film and cause the
high resistance of the sensor in air as illustrated in Figure 6a.65−67 Upon exposure
to NH3 vapor, NH3 molecules as a reducing gas
will react with oxygen species according to the reaction: (2) 4NH3 (gas) + 5O2– (ads) →
4NO (gas) + 6H2O (gas) + 5e–, leading
to discharge of electrons into the conduction band of Sn–TiO2 on the sensor surface (as seen in Figure 6a).27,68,69 This process results in a decrease of the thickness of the electron
depletion layer leading to decrease in the resistance of the sensor.
Moreover, the NH3-sensing process of the Sn–TiO2@rGO/CNT nanocomposite generates a charge between Sn–TiO2 MOS and NH3 molecules to electron transport through
the rGO/CNT nanostructure. The rGO/CNT behaves as the electrical conduction
pathway between Sn–TiO2 grain boundaries due to
the high carrier mobility of rGO/CNT. The Sn–TiO2 nanoparticles are randomly interwoven with the rGO/CNT nanostructure
to form a nanocomposite network that can enhance the surface area
of the sensing film to increases the ability for adsorption and desorption
of gas molecules.

Figure 6 (a) Schematic of the proposed NH3-sensing mechanism
and (b) p–n heterojunction of the Sn–TiO2@rGO/CNT nanocomposite gas sensor.

Furthermore, Sn–TiO2 and rGO/CNT are typical
n-type MOS and p-type semiconductors, respectively. When the p–n
heterojunctions are formed, the electrons in Sn–TiO2 will transfer to rGO/CNT, whereas the holes will transfer from rGO/CNT
to Sn–TiO2 because the n-type Sn–TiO2 has a higher Fermi level than the p-type rGO/CNT, as shown
in Figure 6b.70−72 Once the Sn–TiO2@rGO/CNT sensor is exposed to
NH3 vapor, the reaction between NH3 molecules
and oxygen species will occur on the n-type Sn–TiO2 surface, so that the electrons are released from the ionized oxygen
species back to the conduction band of n-type Sn–TiO2 and combine with holes of p-type rGO/CNT, leading to reduction of
the p–n heterojunction electron depletion layer width and decrease
the potential barrier height (ΔΦ). The resistance of the
Sn–TiO2@rGO/CNT sensor thus decreases upon exposure
to NH3 vapor at room temperature. In addition, after the
sensor is exposed to NH3 molecules, the resistance will
decrease due to the decrease of the potential barrier height at the
p–n heterojunction according to the relationship: R = B exp(ΔΦq/kT), where R is the sensor resistance, B is a constant, q is the electron charge,
ΔΦ is an effective the potential barrier height the p–n
heterojunction, k is Boltzmann’s constant,
and T is the temperature of the sensing layer.39,73

3 Conclusions
In conclusion, Sn–TiO2@rGO/CNT nanocomposites
were successfully synthesized by the solvothermal method and systematically
characterized for NH3 sensing at room temperature. SEM,
TEM, and XPS characterizations confirmed the presence of Sn–TiO2 nanoparticles on the surface of rGO/CNT nanocomposite. As
seen from the gas-sensing results, the Sn–TiO2@rGO/CNT
gas sensor demonstrated a rapid decrease of resistance upon exposure
to NH3 and fully recovered to its baseline values in air
with good repeatability. The nanocomposite I gas sensor Sn–TiO2@rGO/CNT with molar ratio of Sn/Ti (1:10) showed the highest
response to NH3 at room temperature due to balance of p–n
heterojunctions and high active sensing area. Moreover, the Sn–TiO2@rGO/CNT gas sensor exhibited ultrahigh selectivity toward
NH3 against various volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and
environmental gases at room temperature with no effect of humidity
in the range of 30–70% RH. The NH3-sensing mechanism
of the Sn–TiO2@rGO/CNT nanocomposite gas sensor
has been proposed based on the formation of p–n heterojunctions
of p-type rGO/CNT and n-type Sn–TiO2 via the low-temperature
oxidizing reaction process. The observed ultrahigh NH3 selectivity,
high response, relatively short response, and recovery times proved
that the Sn–TiO2@rGO/CNT nanocomposite can be considered
as a promising material for practical application of NH3 detection at room temperature.

4 Experimental
Details
4.1 Synthesis of Sn–TiO2@rGO/CNT
Nanocomposites
The synthesis process of the Sn–TiO2@rGO/CNT nanocomposite is demonstrated in Figure 7. Graphene oxide (GO) was purchased
from ACS Material, LLC. CNT (with diameter 20–40 nm, length
≈ 30 μm) were purchased from Timesnano Co., Ltd. (Chengdu,
China). Sn–TiO2@rGO/CNT composites were synthesized
by the solvothermal method. The amount of 100 mg of GO and CNT was
dispersed in 60 mL of ethanol and treated in an ultrasonic processor
for 30 min. Then, stannous chloride (SnCl2·2H2O) and 1.5 mL of HCl (1 M) were added into the rGO/CNT solution
under mechanical stirring for 30 min. Tetrabutyl titanate (C16H36O4Ti) was mixed into the above suspension
and stirred till molar ratios of Sn/Ti is 1:10. This was followed
by the addition of 2 mL NaOH (1 M) dropwise and mechanically stirred
for 30 min. The solution was then transferred to Teflon-lined stainless-steel
autoclave and heated oven at 180 °C for 12 h. At the end of reaction,
the precipitates were collected, washed with deionized (DI) water
and ethanol 3 times, respectively, and then dried at 80 °C overnight
to obtain the as-prepared Sn–TiO2@rGO/CNT nanocomposites.
Finally, the well crystalline solid powders were sintered at 500 °C
for 3 h. In addition, the Sn–TiO2@rGO/CNT nanocomposite
with different molar ratios of Sn/Ti (3:10 and 5:10) were also produced
with the same process in order to investigate the effects of Sn content
on sensing properties.

synthesis process.

4.2 Fabrication
of Sn–TiO2@rGO/CNT
Nanocomposite Gas Sensors
The fabrication process of the
Sn–TiO2@rGO/CNT nanocomposite gas sensor is displayed
in Figure 8. Sn–TiO2@rGO/CNT nanocomposite powder (100 mg) was dispersed in 1
mL of DI water under ultrasonication for 5 min. The aluminum-interdigitated
electrodes with the size of 4 mm × 4 mm and spacing 100 μm
were prefabricated on an alumina substrate by conventional photolithography,
radio-frequency sputtering, and lift-off processes. Before drop coating
of the sensing film, the aluminum interdigitated electrodes on the
alumina substrate were treated by O2 plasma in order to
improve the adhesion of the sensing film on the substrates and render
a hydrophilic surface. Subsequently, the Sn–TiO2@rGO/CNT aqueous dispersion was drop-coated on the aluminum-interdigitated
electrodes and dried at 80 °C. The fabricated Sn–TiO2@rGO/CNT gas sensors with different molar ratios of Sn/Ti
(1:10, 3:10, and 5:10) were defined as nanocomposite I, nanocomposite
II, and nanocomposite III gas sensors, respectively.

gas sensor fabrication process.

4.3 Gas-Sensing Measurement
The gas-sensing
properties of Sn–TiO2@rGO/CNT nanocomposite gas
sensors were tested in a Teflon chamber with the dynamic flow measurement.
Various gases/VOCs including toluene, DMF, acetone, ammonia, formaldehyde,
ethanol, methanol, isopropanol, thinner, carbon dioxide, hydrogen,
and acetylene were used to evaluate the response and selectivity of
fabricated gas sensors at the room temperature (26 ± 2 °C)
with RH (56 ± 2%). The concentrations of test gases were varied
using mass flow controllers with a flux of synthetic air. The total
gas rate was fixed at 1000 sccm. The baseline of sensors was obtained
by clean air for 3 min, and then the tested gas at a particular concentration
was introduced into the sensor chamber for 2 min. A simple voltage
divider circuit at a fixed voltage of 5 V was employed to measure
the sensor resistances. The resistances of gas sensors were recorded
every 1 s via a USB NI-DAQ 6008 under our developed LabVIEW software.
The performances of the gas sensors were determined by means of gas
response and selectivity. The gas response is defined as S (%) = [(Rair – Rgas)/Rair] × 100, where Rair and Rgas are
the resistance of the fabricated gas sensor in clean air and the test
gas, respectively. Selectivity is the ability of a sensor to identify
a target gas that can be evaluated from relative response between
different gases. The response time is defined as the time required
for the sensor resistance to reach 90% of the final equilibrium signal
upon exposure to the target gas, while the recovery time is the time
needed to recover 90% of the initial baseline.
