An efficient transition-metal-free
protocol for the hydroboration
of aldehydes and ketones (reduction) was developed. The hydroboration
of a wide range of aldehydes and ketones with pinacolborane (HBpin)
under the K2CO3 catalyst has been studied. The
reaction system is practical and reliable and proceeds under extremely
mild and operationally simple conditions. No prior preparation of
the complex metal catalyst was required, and hydroboration occurred
stoichiometrically. Further, the chemoselective reduction of aldehydes
over ketones was carried out. Moreover, we demonstrated the use of
K2CO3 as an efficient catalyst for the hydroboration
of alkenes. The operational simplicity, inexpensive and transition-metal-free
catalyst, and the applicability to gram-scale synthesis strengthen
its potential applications for hydroboration (reduction) at an industrial
scale.

Introduction
One of the core principles
of green chemistry is the development
of atom-economic, low hazardous, and sustainable technologies that
are easy to use.1 Over recent decades,
rapid advances in research and development have been realized in the
pursuit of green processes.2 Hydrofunctionalizations
have found widespread applications in academia and industrial applications
for the production of petrochemicals, automobiles, fine chemicals,
pharmaceutical, perfumes, and consumer products.3 Hydroboration constitutes one of the major hydrofunctionalizations
owing to its broad applicability in the C–X bond formation
(X = C, O, N, P) and functional-group manipulations.4

The operational simplicity and broad synthetic utility
of functionalized
boronates make catalytic hydroboration a highly practiced and economically
favored reaction. These reasons have driven rapid growth in the applications
of metal-mediated (including transition-metal, precious, main group,
and lanthanide metal complexes) hydroborations of unsaturated hydrocarbons,
carbonyl compounds, and imines.5,6 Despite efficient conversions
and good selectivities seen with the aforementioned catalysts/complexes,
these systems suffer from the need for the use of complex ligands,
prepared using tedious procedures.

The use of commercially available
and simple hydroxides and hydrides
for catalytic hydroboration has been demonstrated. In 2011, Query
et al.7 reported the alkoxide-mediated
(NaOtBu) reduction of ketones with pinacolborane
(HBpin) at ambient temperature. Recently, Wu8 and co-workers developed a general method for catalytic hydroboration
of aldehydes, ketones, alkynes, and alkenes with HBpin using powder
NaOH under deuterated solvent and stated nucleophilic coordinations9 with HBpin through natural bond orbital calculations.
Lastly, green and sustainable approaches incorporating organoboron
moieties into organic compounds have drawn attention of the scientists,
starting from the pioneering work reported by Knochel10 and ending with the conclusions provided by Bertrand and
others.11

For instance, Stachowiak
et al. have described the hydroboration
of aldehydes under solvent- and catalyst-free conditions; however,
this method is applicable only to aldehydes and requires higher temperatures
for better conversions.12 Recently, Zhu’s
group reported protocols for the catalytic hydroboration of aldehydes,
ketones, imines, and alkynes with n-BuLi.13 More recently, the Leung group has reported
catalyst-free and solvent-free hydroboration of ketones at an elevated
temperature.14 These results point toward
strong possibility for the development of more efficient and eco-friendly
conditions for the catalytic hydroboration of carbonyl compounds without
the need for highly toxic metals and costly ligands, which is the
objective of our present study. In addition, apart from the hydroboration
of carbonyl compounds, catalytic hydroborations of unsaturated hydrocarbons
(alkenes and alkynes) are scarcely reported with commercially available
and simple salts. However, extensive study on these transformations
using transition complexes (Scheme 1) has been reported.

Scheme 1 Reported Catalyzed
Hydroborations and Present Work
Results
and Discussion
To address these challenges, the development
of green protocols
for sustained use, particularly in large-scale industrial applications,
is highly necessary. To meet such demands, we attempted to find a
convenient protocol for the catalytic hydroboration of carbonyl and
unsaturated hydrocarbons, the results of which we report herein. Aldehydes
and ketones were selectively reduced via catalytic hydroboration under
extremely mild conditions (minimal solvent/low catalyst loading/room
temperature), using 0.5–5 mol % of K2CO3 which delivered the hydroboration products in good to excellent
yields (Scheme 2).

Scheme 2 Potassium Carbonate (0.5–5 mol %)-Promoted Hydroboration of
Aldehydes and Ketones
Initially, reaction parameters such as catalyst selection, loading,
and reaction time were optimized for hydroboration of aldehydes using
benzaldehyde as the model substrate.

For the catalyst selection,
a variety of commercially available
mild salts including Lewis and Brønsted acids (10 mol %) were
screened (see Table S1 in the Supporting Information). To our delight, we found the simple and inexpensive potassium
salts, K2CO3, KOAc, and K3PO4, to be the superior ones among the tested catalysts. Potassium
salts were hence chosen for further optimization. The optimization
results of the catalyst loading and screen are presented in Table 1.

a A = K2CO3,

b Conversions were determined based
on the consumption of aldehydes by GC using the internal standard
(naphthalene).

c Type of the
catalyst was bead.

d Type
of the catalyst was powder.

At 10 mol % catalyst loading, these three potassium salts exhibited
similar reactivity toward catalytic hydroboration of aldehydes (for
a more detailed comparison, see Table S2 in the Supporting Information). However, a dramatic effect was observed
when K2CO3 (1 mol %) was used as powder instead
of bead because of a common rate enhancement phenomenon, observed
in catalytic reactions because of increase in the surface area (Table 1).

Next, we
attempted optimization of the reaction time to obtain
the maximum conversion. Interestingly, the results after modifying
this parameter pointed to the possibilities for reduced catalyst loading.
Accordingly, the use of 0.5 mol % K2CO3 was
tested and provided a 97% conversion in 1 h (entry 2 in Table 1). Even in short reaction time
(30 min), K2CO3 was able to promote catalytic
hydroboration at 0.5 mol % loading (97%, entry 3 in Table 2). However, attempts to further
reduce the loading to 0.1 mol % delivered only 36% conversion (entry
5 in Table 2), while
no hydroboration was observed in the absence of the catalyst under
this protocol (entry 6 in Table 2). Next, hydroboration was carried out in different
solvent systems such as with diethyl ether, DCM, hexane, CHCl3, and toluene. However, tetrahydrofuran (THF) was found to
be superior among the tested ones (entries 7–11). In addition,
the neat condition facilitated moderate conversion to the product
(entry 12).

a Conversion

b Yields of alcohols were determined

c Reaction was performed under no
catalyst condition. NR: no reaction.

With the optimized parameters in hand, we tested the
substrate
scope of the developed protocol. The results in Table 3 indicate that most of the aldehydes undergo
smooth catalytic hydroboration and afforded the corresponding boronate
esters in good to excellent yields with 0.5 mol % K2CO3. Substrates with electron-withdrawing substituents afforded
hydroboration more quickly when compared to electron-donating ones.
Among the electron-poor, chloro, bromo, and nitro substituents resulted
in excellent conversion to products, whereas 4-bromo and 4-fluoro
substituents resulted in hydroboration in reasonable yield. Further,
heterocyclic and aliphatic aldehydes also furnished the corresponding
boronate esters using the present protocol. Cinnamaldehyde, a conjugated
aldehyde, yielded the corresponding 1,2 reduction product selectively
(Table 3).

a Conversions
were determined by GC.

b Yields
were determined by 1H NMR spectroscopy using acetonitrile
as an internal standard.

Having established the conditions for hydroboration of aldehydes,
we attempted the catalytic hydroboration of ketones. However, lower
conversion was obtained with ketone substrates under which the conditions
were optimized for aldehyde hydroboration. Modifications to the optimized
conditions were studied (Table 4) and an increase in the catalyst loading to 5 mol % along
with the increase in reaction time significantly improved the conversions
and yield (96%) with 12 h being the optimal reaction time.

a Yields were determined by 1H NMR spectroscopy using acetonitrile
as an internal standard.

With the optimized conditions available, the substrate scope was
evaluated for the ketone functionality. As can be seen from Table 5, ketones afforded
the corresponding alcohols after the base hydrolysis of the intermediate
boronates. Acetophenone produced the boronate with 96% conversion.
As seen with the aldehydes, ketones containing electron-withdrawing
substituents underwent smooth hydroboration, while electron-rich substrates
displayed poor reactivity in this system (Table 5).

b Reacted with HBpin (3.0 equiv).

Next, the potential scalability
of the present protocol was evaluated.
Benzaldehyde (10 mmol) was treated with 0.5 mol % of K2CO3 and HBpin. Excellent conversion with a good isolated
yield of benzyl alcohol was obtained under mild conditions (Scheme 3).

Scheme 3 Scale-Up Reaction
of Catalyzed Hydroboration using K2CO3 and HBpin
From the above results, we anticipated that
the present system
is suitable for chemoselective hydroboration. Accordingly, aldehydes
were treated with HBpin and K2CO3 under the
reaction conditions optimized for aldehydes, in the presence of ketones
(Scheme 4).

Scheme 4 Intermolecular
Chemoselective Hydroboration of Aldehydes in the Presence
of Ketones
Density functional theory calculations
were performed to explore
the reaction pathway for the K2CO3-catalyzed
hydroboration of aldehydes. Scheme 5 represents an energy profile for the reaction where
the HBpin initially reacts with the catalyst to produce the zwitterionic
intermediate A. The subsequent reaction of the intermediate A with aldehydes would generate the intermediate B which turns into the intermediate C through a hexagonal
ring transition state TS1. Then, a ligand exchange reaction
of the intermediate C with another HBpin yields the intermediate D which participates in a catalytic cycle. The subsequent
reaction of the intermediate D with aldehydes leads to
the intermediate E, followed by the generation of the
intermediate F through TS2. The catalytic
cycle is then accomplished when the intermediate F reproduces
the intermediate D along with the boronate ester through
a ligand exchange reaction with HBpin. A plausible reaction mechanism
based on the energy profile in Scheme 5 is proposed in Scheme 6.

We next evaluated
the catalytic hydroboration of alkenes using
K2CO3 and HBpin. The reaction conditions were
optimized for the preparation of alkyl boronate esters. The hydroboration
of styrene with HBpin (4.0 equiv) using 5 mol % catalyst loading at
60 °C furnished the corresponding alkyl boronic ester in 66%
yield after 24 h (entry 1 in Table 6).

a Yields were determined by 1H NMR.

b Yields in parentheses report the
branched products.

A small
increase in product yield was obtained upon increasing
the catalyst loading to 10 mol % and reducing the reaction time (entry
2 in Table 6). An increase
in the catalyst loading to 20 mol % afforded the desired product in
90% yield with the use of 4.0 equiv of HBpin after 12 h reaction time
(entry 4 in Table 6).

However, in order to reduce the catalyst loading and the
equivalents
of HBpin, the reaction temperature was increased to 110 °C. Hydroboration
with 2.0 and 3.0 equiv of HBpin afforded the product in more than
90% of yield after 12 h (entries 7, 8 in Table 6). The equivalents of the HBpin were then
fixed to 2 and the reaction time was optimized. Using the optimized
conditions, the product was synthesized in 96% yield after 3 h reaction
time (entry 10 in Table 6). To assess the role of the catalyst in conversion, we have carried
out hydroboration using the optimized conditions in the absence of
the catalyst which gave a much lower conversion to the boronate ester
and a low yield (entry 12 in Table 6). Given this, the conditions in entry 10, with 5 mol
% of the catalyst, 2 equiv of HBpin, a reaction time of 3 h, and a
110 °C reaction temperature were chosen as the optimal conditions.

To assess the reactivity of the present catalytic system, a comparative
study for hydroboration of alkene has been conducted with other metal
carbonate such as Na2CO3, which delivered lower
yields (see Table S4 in the Supporting Information). Using the optimized conditions, we have evaluated the substrate
scope of the reaction. In contrast to aldehydes and ketones, alkenes
bearing electron-donating substituents (2-methyl, 3-methy, 4-methyl,
and 4-methoxy) afforded the corresponding boronate esters with greater
regioselectivity and conversions (6b–f in Table 7).

b The reaction was conducted for 12

α-Methylstyrene
in which the methyl group is located at the
benzylic position was highly regioselective but afforded the product
in relatively low yield (6g). 4-Acetoxy styrene bearing
an ester functional group, and the 2-vinylpyridine substrates did
not undergo hydroboration under this condition (6h and 6l). Styrenes containing electron-withdrawing groups afforded
the products with slightly reduced regioselectivity (6i–j). Alkenes substituted with the polyaromatic group and the aliphatic
chain also displayed similar reactivity as the halogen-bearing styrenes
(6k and 6n), while allylbenzene afforded
the product with exclusive regioselectivity (6m).

Conclusions
An efficient protocol for catalyzed hydroboration of aldehydes
and ketones with the commercially available potassium carbonate (K2CO3) is reported. K2CO3 successfully
catalyzed the hydroboration of various aldehydes and ketones with
stoichiometric conversions at low catalyst loading. In addition, aldehydes
were reduced chemoselectively in the presence of ketones using the
developed catalytic system. Further, synthetically important alkyl
boronates were synthesized by K2CO3-catalyzed
hydroboration of variedly substituted alkenes. The developed green
catalyzed hydroboration methodology displays a broad substrate scope
and functional group tolerance. The catalyst is inexpensive, very
mild, and readily available and generates simple, nontoxic byproducts
and has potential applications in large-scale hydroborations compared
to toxic metals and strong bases.

Experimental Section
General
Information
All glassware used was dried thoroughly
in an oven, assembled hot, and cooled under a stream of dry nitrogen
prior to use. All reactions and manipulations of air- and moisture-sensitive
materials were carried out using standard techniques for the handling
of such materials. All the chemicals were commercial products of the
highest purity, which were further purified before use by using standard
methods. HBpin, aldehydes, ketones, alkenes were purchased from Aldrich
Chemical Company, Alfa Aesar, and Tokyo Chemical Industry Company
(TCI). 1H NMR spectra were measured at 400 MHz with CDCl3 as a solvent at ambient temperature unless otherwise indicated
and the chemical shifts were recorded in parts per million downfield
from tetramethylsilane (δ = 0 ppm) or based on residual CDCl3 (δ = 7.26 ppm) as the internal standard. 13C NMR spectra were recorded at 100 MHz with CDCl3 as a
solvent and referenced to the central line of the solvent (δ
= 77.0 ppm). The coupling constants (J) are reported
in hertz. Analytical thin-layer chromatography was performed on glass
precoated with silica gel (Merck, silica gel 60 F254). Column chromatography
was carried out using 70–230 mesh silica gel (Merck) at normal
pressure. Gas chromatography (GC) analyses were performed on a Younglin
Acme 6100M and 6500 GC FID chromatography, using an HP-5 capillary
column (30 m). All GC yields were determined with the use of naphthalene
as the internal standard and the authentic sample.25
