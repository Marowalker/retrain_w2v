Electronic cigarettes enabling
enhanced airflow have grown in popularity in recent years. The objective
of this study is to show that flow rates modulate the levels of specific
aerosol toxicants produced in electronic cigarettes. Flow rates used
in various laboratory investigations involving e-cigarettes have varied
widely to date, and can thus promote interlaboratory variability in
aerosol product profiles. The thermal decomposition of hydroxyacetone
and glycolaldehyde is less favorable at lower temperatures, supporting
the observations of these products at higher flow rates/lower heating
coil temperatures. Higher temperatures promote the formation of acetaldehyde
from hydroxyacetone and formaldehyde from both hydroxyacetone and
glycolaldehyde. A separate finding is that greater airflow can also
expose users to concerning levels of e-liquid solvents. Under the
modest conditions studied, propylene glycol aerosol levels are found
at above the acceptable inhalation levels defined by NASA, and in
range of the generally recognized as safe levels for daily ingestion.

Introduction
Smoking is the second
leading risk factor for early death and disability
in the world.1 Most smokers initiate tobacco
usage during adolescence.2 Recently, electronic
cigarettes surpassed combustible cigarettes in popularity among youth
in the United States, with one in six high school and middle school
students reporting current use.3−5 It is thus concerning that the
results of an extensive recent meta-analysis showed that electronic
cigarettes are a strong, independent risk factor for smoking initiation
among adolescents and young adults.6 Advocates
claim that e-cigarettes deliver fewer toxins in lower doses to users
compared to combustible cigarettes. However, such comparisons are
of little relevance to the large number of young people using e-cigarettes
before other tobacco products.3,4

In addition, more
basic research, beyond benchmarking e-cigarette
aerosol components and their biomarkers against those of combustible
cigarettes,7 is needed to more completely
assess potential health effects. For example, there is significant
interlaboratory variation in the levels of e-cigarette aerosol products
reported (Table S1, Supporting Information).
In addition to a lack of standardized analytical protocols, this is
attributable to multiple factors including the many custom e-liquid
formulations, the frequent appearance of new device configurations
on the market, variable heating coil morphology and related component
properties, as well as individual user puffing topography patterns
(Table 1), etc. Varying
airflow rates, a significant component of puff topography, can differ
widely among users, which can serve as a confounding element, hampering
studies not only of topography but also of aerosol chemistry.

There
are two common methods of inhaling e-cigarette aerosols.
These are mouth-to-lung (MTL) and direct lung inhalation (DLI). MTL
vaping is analogous to traditional cigarette and cigar smoking, wherein
the user initially draws vapor into the mouth before inhaling into
the lungs. In DLI, as the name implies, aerosol is inhaled directly
into the lungs. MTL usage is generally performed with lower-power
devices, with more restricted airflow, and affords less aerosol. DLI
is for those wanting to optimize the amount of aerosol inhaled and
the production of large “clouds.” In general, DLI equipment
consists of lower resistance (sub-ohm) coils, high-power batteries,
looser airflow, and higher proportions of glycerol/propylene glycol
(GLY/PG). Moreover, MTL vaping is typically preferred by ex-smokers.
DLI is preferred by “cloud chasers,” or vapers whose
goal is to create large aerosol plumes.22 Cloud chasing has emerged as a competitive sport. Teens are often
participants in cloud competitions. Evidence is emerging that, in
addition to flavorings, cloud chasing and related “vapor tricks”
are among the primary motivations for teen usage of e-cigarettes.22−25

To address, at least in part, the growing popularity of DLI
and
cloud chasing, the majority of currently available sub-ohm and rebuildable
atomizers are fabricated with adjustable airflow. Airflow resistance
and pressure drop are modulated by the aperture of the atomizer’s
air slits, affecting the airflow rate through the e-cigarette and
its heating coil.26 Faster airflow lowers
the heating coil temperature.27 However,
despite its effects on the e-cigarette heating coil temperature, the
influence of flow rate on aerosol toxin profiles and e-liquid consumption
has not been formally investigated. Moreover, clinical studies have
found that flow rates can vary among users, though most appear to
fall within a range of ∼20 to ∼39 mL/s (Table 1). The recent literature (Table 2) shows that there
has been wide interlaboratory variability in the settings used by
researchers for the factors of puff volume and puff duration, which
together give rise to the airflow rate. We thus propose that differences
in airflow rate can impact not only user exposure to inhalable toxins
but also the variability in reported aerosol product profiles.

Results and Discussion
Aerosol
Product Profiles are a Function of Airflow Rate
Previous
studies have mainly focused on the influence of heating
coil temperature or operational voltage/wattage on e-liquid enhanced
toxicant production.28−30,32−36,41−44 Zhao has reported that flow rates
are inversely related to heating coil temperatures.27 One may thus assume that lower flow rates would lead to
greater toxicant production. Interestingly, our data (Table 3) show that of the five aerosol
products studied, glycolaldehyde and hydroxyacetone levels are lower
when a lower flow rate is employed.

Previously, we reported that hydroxyacetone and glycolaldehyde
were formed faster at relatively lower temperatures compared to all
of the other PG/GLY aerosol products identified.44 Glycoladehyde is an oxidation product of GLY, formed via
H-abstraction to an oxygen radical followed by the C–C bond
scission (Scheme 1).
Hydroxyacetone is formed mainly from the oxidation of PG (in addition,
e.g., to the thermal dehydration of GLY).44 Moreover, glycolaldehyde and hydroxyacetone disappearance at lower
airflow (hotter conditions) can be attributed to their thermal conversion
to formaldehyde and acetaldehyde, respectively. For instance, it is
well-known that acetaldehyde and formaldehyde levels increase in e-cigarette
aerosols as a function of operational power.

Scheme 1 Summary of Major
(but Not Exclusive) Pathways Leading to Products
Formed Primarily via Either Dehydration (Acrolein and Propanal) or
Oxidation (Glycolaldehyde and Hydroxyacetone)
Formaldehyde
(not shown) is a
byproduct of the formation of glycolaldehyde, hydroxyacetone, and
acetaldehyde. One of several routes to hydroxyacetone has been reported
to involve the dehydration of GLY; however, hydroxyacetone and glycolaldehyde
are primarily oxidation products. Acetaldehyde is well-known to derive
from the stable intermediate hydroxyacetone, thus its formation requires
additional heat.44

The higher levels of propanal and acrolein observed under lower
flow conditions (Table 3) are consistent with their formation via thermal dehydration reactions44 in which propanal and acrolein are the end products.
Propanal and acrolein are well-known thermal dehydration products
involving epoxide intermediates. Propanal is derived from PG via 2-methyloxirane,
whereas acrolein arises from GLY via glycidol.45,46

For the observed products, gas-phase Gibbs free energies of
formation,
ΔGf,i° (P° = 1 atm), are
calculated using the ASTM Computer Program for Chemical Thermodynamic
and Energy Release Evaluation (CHETAH) v.10 for T = 423–573 K. For each reaction in Scheme 1, the reaction equilibrium constant is calculated
from the estimated Gibbs free energy of reaction (ΔGrxn = ∑i, prodΔGf,i° +
∑i, reactΔGf,i°) as follows: Keq = −Grxn/RT, where R = 8.314 × 10–3 kJ/mol K. Table 4 lists Keq as a function
of temperature for the formation of propanal, acrolein, acetaldehyde,
hydroxyacetone (via dehydration), and formaldehyde.

As the e-liquid is heated and evaporated,
the e-liquid constituents
are converted in the gas phase in proportions dependent on their concentrations
in the mixture and their pure liquid vapor pressures. Assuming a liquid-phase
equilibrium, composition (mole fraction basis) of 0.48 PG:0.48 GLY:0.05
H2O yields the gas-phase equilibrium composition (mole
fraction) shown in Table 5 as a function of temperature. These compositions approximate
the initial conditions for oxidation and dehydration product formation
in the gas phase.

Although the dehydration
pathways are thermodynamically favorable
across all heating temperatures (Table 4), at the lower heating temperatures there is a significant
amount of gas-phase water driving the reaction away from product formation
(e.g., propanal and acrolein). At higher temperatures, the relative
amounts of PG and GLY in the gas phase increase, promoting the amount
of product formation at higher temperatures. This thermodynamic analysis
supports the greater observed formation of propanal and acrolein at
lower flow rates/higher heating temperatures. Thermal decomposition
of hydroxyacetone and glycolaldehyde are not thermodynamically favored
at lower temperatures (Table 4), supporting the observation of these products at higher
flow rates/lower heating temperatures. As temperature increases, the
formation of acetaldehyde from hydroxyacetone and formaldehyde from
hydroxyacetone and glycolaldehyde become increasingly thermodynamically
favorable, reaching positive values above 573 K. Thermal decomposition
of hydroxyacetone to form acetaldehyde is observed in this work at
the lower flow rates/higher heating temperatures. Although formaldehyde
levels are not reported in this work, the thermodynamic favorability
of its formation via thermal dehydration above 573 K supports the
low levels of hydroxyacetone and glycolaldehyde observed at lower
flow rates and or higher heating temperatures. The total amount of
product observed in the collected aerosol (gas and particle phase)
may also be affected by reactions in the condensed phase, as product
formation may occur in the bulk e-liquid (followed by evaporation
of the products) or in droplets as the vapor cools.

Increased Airflow
Increases Solvent Consumption
It
is known that the flow of air or gas across an evaporative surface
increases the vaporization rates.48,49 Thus, power
settings are not the sole factor to consider in enhancing vaporization.
We measured the effect of airflow on aerosol consumption (Figure 1). As expected, a
faster flow rate generally leads to less dense aerosols (Figure S2, Supporting Information), along with
a greater PG/GLY consumption. The airflow rates investigated are 7.0,
18.3, and 36.0 mL/s. The intermediate 18.3 mL/s flow is from the CORESTA
standard. The 7.0 mL/s value is chosen because it is the value required
to activate one of the first-generation devices.26 The 36.0 mL/s flow approximates a relatively high range
reported in recent vaping topography investigations (Table 1). As mentioned above, newer-generation
e-cigarettes allow for less restricted airflow. In our earlier investigation
using an older e-cigarette, a maximum of just 11 mg per puff of e-liquid
was consumed at the highest device power and at the airflow rates
of 12.5–16.7 mL/s.35Figure 1 shows that the KangerTech
Subtank Mini used in the study herein consumes ≤11 mg/puff
of PG/GLY only at wattages lower than those that are typically used
by most vapers.50

Figure 1 E-Liquid Consumption
Per Puff as a Function of Power (mL/s): Flow
Rate-Dependent Pattern.

The intake of e-liquid solvent by a user can markedly increase
not only as a function of power settings but also as a function of
airflow (Figure 1).
PG and GLY are generally recognized as safe (GRAS) for human consumption.
For ingestion via food, the World Health Organization recommends an
average daily intake (ADI) maximum of 25 mg/kg of body weight for
PG.51 However, the inhalation toxicity
of PG and GLY based on exposure to humans is not established. Thus,
PG and GLY have been assigned the default occupational 8 h threshold
limit values of 10 mg/m3.52

For a 70 kg human, 1750 mg (70 kg × 25 mg/kg/day) corresponds
to the ADI maximum PG intake/day by ingestion (i.e., GRAS), not inhalation.
At the power level of 24 W, which is within the manufacturer’s
recommended range for the e-cigarette used herein,50 at a relatively modest airflow of 18.3 mL/s, Figure 1 shows that 18.50 mg of PG/GLY
is consumed. At 200 puffs/day (Table 1), a user would thus inhale 3700 mg/day of 1:1 PG/GLY.
At 200 puffs/day and a 36.0 mL/s flow rate, 5660 mg 1:1 PG:GLY is
inhaled. Assuming 50% of the aerosol is PG (and this percentage can
be higher or lower in commercial e-liquids), these inhalation values
are in range of the GRAS maximum levels for PG in food.

The
National Aeronautics and Space Administration has calculated
a Spacecraft Maximum Acceptable Concentration (SMAC) for PG of 32
ppm for 1 h, based on the calculations from a study involving human
subjects.53 Using the physiological daily
inhalation rate of 17.48 m3/day54 (0.7283 m3/h) to estimate the breath volume for a 23–30
year old adult males, affords 75 mg PG (using 1 ppm = 3.2 mg/m3 conversion)53 as the maximum SMAC
limit per hour. According to Figure 1, the e-cigarette used in this study at 24 W delivers
18.50 mg/puff and 28.30 mg/puff at airflow rates of 18.3 and 36.0
mL/s, respectively. At 25 puffs/h, the PG/GLY inhaled at 18.3 mL/s
is 462.5 mg/h. If 50% of the aerosol is PG, and assuming ∼50%
of the PG is exhaled, a user would be exposed to 115.6 mg PG/h (not
accounting for any possible aerosol re-inhaled after release into
a room). The corresponding level of PG consumed in 1 h at the 36.0
mL/s flow rate is 176.9 mg. Each estimate exceeds the 75 mg SMAC value,
does not take into account any effect of GLY, and assumes 50% of the
PG is exhaled, though it is reportedly absorbed rapidly.55 The absorption of e-cigarette aerosols will
also be higher when users engage in “stealth vaping,”
which can involve more intense inhalation and longer lung retention.56 Importantly, the device used in this study may
underestimate the amount of aerosol inhaled compared to the lower
resistance sub-ohm coils.

The potential harm of PG/GLY in e-cigarettes
has been reported
previously; however, only e-cigarettes available up until 2013 were
considered.57 The older devices delivered
less e-liquid as aerosol as compared to current generation (e.g.,
sub-ohm) e-cigarettes. In addition, in 2013, an extreme volume of
e-liquid consumed per day was considered to be 5–25 mL/day;57 however, several vapers reported in a 2016 forum
that they consume ≥25 mL/day.58 Many
e-cigarettes with improved wicking and heat transfer properties are
now on the market, including those enabling enhanced airflow. Limited
studies to date have shown promising results in suppressing aldehyde-derived
aerosol degradation product levels.30 However,
such devices also deliver higher levels of PG and GLY, which should
be taken into account when assessing frequency of use and potential
toxicity.

Conclusions
A main outcome of this
study is that aerosol product profiles change
as a function of airflow rates. Because slower airflow leads to higher
heating coil temperatures, thermal dehydration products form more
readily. In a similar manner, oxidation products form at relatively
greater levels when airflow is increased. Because airflow influences
individual aerosol product levels when keeping other variables constant,
it should be accounted for when comparing intra- and interlaboratory
studies of toxicant levels (Table S1, Supporting
Information). For example, experimental airflow rates have, to date,
varied widely among research studies (from 8 to 39 mL/s; Table 2). It is difficult
to be certain of a clear trend just based on the literature to date
due to the other experimental variables that differ among laboratories.
Interestingly, relatively very low levels of aldehydes have been observed
as PG and GLY decomposition products in studies that employed the
highest flow rates (39 mL/s; see Table 2).32,33 The second main outcome of this
investigation is the finding that e-cigarette solvent consumption
increases significantly with increased airflow. Increased airflow
is a main factor enabling vapers to achieve larger aerosol clouds
but also facilitates reaching threshold dietary safety levels of e-cigarette
solvent consumption. This is particularly concerning due to the popularity
of DLI vaping and cloud tricks among young people.

Methods
Materials and
Equipment
The brand and type of battery
unit and atomizer were chosen based on availability and popularity.
The electronic cigarette consisted of a variable voltage battery unit
Tesla Invader III with two 18650 HG2 LG batteries (3.7 V, 3000 mAh)
and a KangerTech SubTank Mini atomizer referred as a popular device
with operational power of 15–30 W.50 The atomizer included a KangerTech “OCC” coil housing,
which was rebuilt with a single bottom horizontal heating element.
Twenty-eight AWG A1 kanthal wire was used to construct the single
bottom coils with a 1.26 ± 0.06 Ω resistance. E-liquid
was prepared by adding equimolar amounts of GLY and PG (0.2 moles
of each reagent, 18.4180 g of GLY and 15.2180 g of PG) to a tared
50 mL flask, with subsequent mixing and vortexing.

Aerosol Production
for Toxicant Analysis
PG and GLY
decomposition product profiles were investigated as a function of
flow rate. Other variables such as coil type, e-cigarette, and e-liquid
composition were fixed in all of the experiments. Aerosol was produced
by a Single Cigarette Smoking Machine SCSM-STEP (SCSM-STEP, CH Technologies,
Westwood, NJ), using two vaping modes, CORESTA (3 s puff duration,
30 s puff interval, 55 mL puff volume) and Custom Square Mode (3 s
puff duration, 30 s puff interval, 21 mL puff volume), corresponding
to flow rates of 18.3 and 7.0 mL/s, respectively.59 The e-cigarette was operated manually with a 1 s power
button activation before vaping. In the experimental setup, the aerosol
generated by the electronic cigarette was drawn into an impinger containing
DMSO-d6 followed by a −78 °C
cold trap (dry ice/acetone) connected to the SCSM-STEP Machine (Figure S1, Supporting Information). Triplicate
experiments with two variable flow rates were performed for the following
wattages: 11, 13, 17, 24, and 35 W.

Avoidance of Dry Coil and
Overheated E-Liquid
Atomizers
were filled to 2/3 of their tank capacity to avoid drying and overheating
the coil and burning the e-liquid; wicks were primed before use (as
per manufacturer’s instructions) by directly wetting with e-liquid.
Coils were inspected after each vaping session and reused up to 100
puffs. Replicates were discarded if any signs of dry coil were observed,
including but not limited to wicking material discoloration, coil
discoloration, or burnt sample odor. Overall, two replicates were
discarded due to wick discoloration from a white to a slightly yellow
color in experiments at 11–24 W; experiments at 35 W were discarded
due to a potentially dry coil and burnt e-liquid.

Quantification
Methods and Analytical Determination of Vapor
Composition
Previously, we used quantitative NMR (qNMR) for
analyzing e-cigarette aerosol toxins. This enabled the discovery of
previously unreported e-cigarette aerosol components. In a recent
paper,60 we validated the qNMR method including
comparison to the U.S. EPA standard methods. Our rationale for using
NMR in e-cigarette work is (i) NMR is a chemically nondestructive
method and (ii) e-cigarette aerosols contain both gas phase and particulate
phases, and our sample collection method combined with NMR allows
profiling of analytes partitioned into both phases.

During each
vaping session, 20 puffs were collected. Each session was followed
by washing the cold trap with aliquots of impinger solution. Samples
for 1H NMR spectroscopy were prepared from the combination
of the total impinger solution plus the solution of cold trap washes. 1H NMR spectra (Figures S3–S5, Supporting Information) were acquired on a Bruker Avance II + 400
MHz spectrometer using a zg30 pulse program, a 60.0 s relaxation delay
and 1024 scans. The analyte signals were integrated with respect to
the internal standard (2,3,5,6-tetrachloronitrobenzene; Tokyo Chemical
Industry Co., LTD) signal at ∼8.5 ppm.

The mass yield
of each analyte was calculated using their integral
areas (Ix and Istd), the molar masses (Mx), and the numbers
of nuclei (Nx and Nstd) with respect to weight (Wstd) of the internal standard using the following equation  where x and std are referred to the analyte
and the standard, respectively.

Experiments at 11–17
W showed toxicants with concentrations
lower than limit of quantitation and limit of detection (Table S2, Supporting Information).

Aerosol Production
for E-Liquid Consumption Analysis
SCSM-STEP was operated
under three vaping modes: CORESTA (3 s puff
duration, 30 s puff interval, 55 mL puff volume) and two Custom Square
Modes (3 s puff duration, 30 s puff interval, 108 and 21 mL puff volumes),
corresponding to flow rates of 18.3, 36.0, and 7.0 mL/s, respectively.59 The mass of consumed e-liquid was recorded by
weighing the atomizer before and after vaping.
