Modification of arginine residues
using dicarbonyl compounds is a common method to identify functional
or reactive arginine residues in proteins. Arginine undergoes several
kinds of posttranslational modifications in these functional residues.
Identifying these reactive residues confidently in a protein or large-scale
samples is a very challenging task. Several dicarbonyl compounds have
been utilized, and the most effective ones are phenylglyoxal and cyclohexanedione.
However, tracking these reactive
arginine residues in a protein or large-scale protein samples using
a chemical labeling approach is very challenging. Thus, the enrichment
of modified peptides will provide reduced sample complexity and confident
mass-spectrometric data analysis. To pinpoint arginine-labeled peptide
efficiently, we developed a novel arginine-selective enrichment reagent.
For the first time, we conjugated an azide tag in a widely used dicarbonyl
compound cyclohexanedione. This provided us the ability to enrich
modified peptides using a bio-orthogonal click chemistry and the biotin–avidin
affinity chromatography. We evaluated the reagent in several standard
peptides and proteins. Three standard peptides, bradykinin, substance
P, and neurotensin, were labeled with this cyclohexanedione-azide
reagent. Click labeling of modified peptides was tested by spiking
the peptides in a myoglobin protein digest. A protein, RNase A, was
also labeled with the reagent, and after click chemistry and biotin–avidin
affinity chromatography, we identified two selective arginine residues.
We believe this strategy will be an efficient way for identifying
functional and reactive arginine residues in a protein or protein
mixtures.

Introduction
Arginine
is one of the basic amino acids of proteins and functionally very
important for protein structures, enzyme activities, and protein interactions.1−4 Arginine goes through several kinds of posttranslational modifications
(PTMs) during cellular processes. Among them, glycation is a nonenzymatic
modification of proteins, which is the result of the addition of a
sugar molecule to a protein by Maillard reaction.5 In this reaction, nucleophilic amino groups of amino acids
react with carbonyl groups of the sugar to form a Schiff base product.
This unstable Schiff base intermediate rearranges to a stable adduct
known as Amadori product, which is a keto-amine compound. This irreversible
covalent modification can occur particularly at protein arginine residues
by carbonyl compounds, resulting in the formation of advanced glycation
end products (AGEs).5−7 AGEs lead to many diseases including diabetes mellitus,
alzheimer’s disease, and atherosclerosis.8−10

AGEs
can be formed not only from the reducing sugars but also from dicarbonyl
compounds such as glyoxal and methylglyoxal, which are intermediates
of several cellular processes. These dicarbonyl compounds are more
selective to guanidino, amino, and thiol group of proteins and nucleic
acids.11 Methylglyoxal modifications have
also been observed in arginine residues in recombinant antibody developed
for protein therapeutics.12 Methylglyoxal
reaction with arginines and arginyl residues in proteins was reported
by Takashi in 1977, Cheung and Fonda in 1979, and Selwood and Thornalley
in 1993.13−15 Brock and his group addressed the site specificity
of AGE formation on ribonuclease and they found that the main site
of carboxymethylation was at lysine-416 Apart from that, Cotham et al. in 2004 reported that the glyoxal-derivative
formation takes place mainly at arginine-39 and arginine-85.17

Identifying the specific binding sites
of proteins plays a significant role in drug discovery.18,19 Chemical modification is a powerful technique for identifying these
reactive residues.20,21 The reactivity of arginine toward
dicarbonyl groups was evaluated thoroughly by our group recently.22 In cellular processes, these dicarbonyl compounds
modify mainly arginine residues, which are functional, reactive, or
surface-accessible. Locating these modifications in a protein and
large-scale samples is very difficult because of sample complexity
after digestion. The present study aimed at the development of an
enrichment strategy for the reactive arginine residue containing peptides.
In this study, we introduced an azide tag in a widely known arginine-reactive
reagent, cyclohexanedione (CHD), hence reactive peptides can be affinity-purified
utilizing bio-orthogonal click chemistry and biotin–avidin
chromatography. This will help studying protein surface topology’s
targeting arginines, PTM status in those residues, and profiling enzyme
activities confidently.

Incorporating an affinity tag in dicarbonyl
compounds is very challenging because of the difficulty of synthesis.
To the best of our knowledge, for the first time, we are reporting
an arginine-selective reagent with an azide functionality. Azides
are known to be bio-orthogonal reagents, which do not undergo any
side reactions with the functional groups present in the proteins.23,24 They selectively react with alkynes to form a triazole product during
an azide–alkyne cycloaddition reaction called click chemistry.25,26 In this study, we performed the chemical labeling of the arginine
residues in peptides and proteins using our arginine-selective reagent.
Finally, chemically modified peptides were affinity-purified by avidin–biotin
coupling after click reaction. We demonstrated selective labeling
of reactive arginine residues in ribonuclease A (RNase A) protein
using this cyclohexanedione-azide (CHD-Azide) compound. We believe
that with efficient clickable reagent, this chemical labeling approach
will help us to study reactive or functional arginines in proteins
in large-scale studies. Further selective profiling of these arginines
in diseased samples using a targeted proteomics approach will provide
information about the PTM status of these residues.

Results and Discussion
Modification
of Peptides by the CHD-Azide Reagent
A scheme of the chemical
labeling and affinity purification of reactive arginine residues containing
peptides is shown in Figure 1. At first, chemical labeling of arginine residues in peptides/proteins
using CHD-Azide was performed. The structure of CHD-Azide is shown
in the same scheme (see also Figure S1).
After that, proteins were digested and resultant peptides were coupled
using a clickable biotinylated reagent biotin-PEG4-alkyne (Figure S1). With subsequent click labeling, the
CHD-Azide-labeled peptides were enriched using biotin–avidin
affinity chromatography. Liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry
(LC–MS)/MS analysis of enriched peptides provided the identity
and the location of the CHD-Azide reacted products.

affinity purification strategy of reactive arginine residues by arginine-selective
CHD-Azide reagent and bio-orthogonal click chemistry.

Electrospray ionization (ESI)–MS analysis
of the modified model peptides is shown in Figure 2. The three model peptides we used in our
studies include bradykinin (RPPGFSPFR, monoisotopic mass 1059.5614
Da), substance P (RPKPQQFFGLM, monoisotopic mass 1346.7281 Da), and
N-terminal blocked peptide, neurotensin (pyroglu-LYENKPRRPYIL, monoisotopic
unmodified mass 1671.9097 Da). These three model peptides contained
two arginine residues at the two terminal ends, single arginine at
the N-terminal end, and two adjacent arginine residues in the middle
of the peptide, respectively. CHD-Azide-modified bradykinin mass was
given in Figure 2A
at m/z 749.92 [M + 2H]2+ and at m/z 500.34 [M + 3H]3+. Details of mass addition are shown with ChemDraw in Figure S2A,B. We also compared the fragmentation pattern of
the unmodified and modified peptides (see the Supporting Information for comparison, Figure S3). The modified
peptide clearly showed complete labeling of two arginines by this
CHD-Azide reagent.

CHD-Azide reagent. (A) CHD-Azide-modified bradykinin at m/z 749.92 (M + 2H + CHD-Azide)2+ and m/z 500.34 (M + 3H + CHD-Azide)3+. (B) MS/MS

CHD-Azide-modified neurotensin at m/z 704.76 (M + 3H + CHD-Azide)3+. See the Supporting Information for unmodified spectra for comparison.
* denotes CHD-Azide-modified sites.

Furthermore, the modification with neurotensin yielded two
peaks at m/z 1056.60 for the doubly
charged ion and for the triply charged ion at m/z 704.76 (Figure 2C). The mass difference between the unmodified neurotensin
mass at m/z 837.45 and m/z 558.66 confirmed dual CHD-Azide incorporation
to the two adjacent internal arginine residues in the peptide (Figures S2B and S3B). The results were further
confirmed by tandem MS studies after careful inspection of all MS/MS
spectra from modified peptides.

Tandem MS Studies of the
Peptides
CHD-Azide modification at the two-arginine-containing
peptide bradykinin R*PPGFSPFR* (Figure 2A) was characterized by the CID tandem MS spectra (Figure 2B). Fragmentations
of the doubly charged molecular ion at m/z 749.92 (Figure 2B) and unmodified parent ion at m/z 530.85 are given in the Supporting Information (Figure S3), respectively. The mass difference
438.14 Da revealed that the two arginine residues are modified with
the CHD-Azide. Note that for the formation of a single CHD-Azide adduct,
the mass addition is 219.07 Da. The annotated MS/MS spectrum in Figure 2B gave the modified
b and y ion series (detailed m/z of fragment ions are provided in an Excel file). It is notable that
the addition of 219.14 Da to modified ion fragments corresponds to
the formation of two CHD-Azide adducts with the two arginine residues.

Figure 2D shows
the MS/MS spectrum obtained after reaction between CHD-Azide and neurotensin.
These data further supported the conclusion that the two arginine
residues are modified by CHD-Azide. Most of the b and y ion fragments
were observed with high abundance (please see the Excel file for the
fragment ion mass). The above deduction was confirmed by the mass
difference between the unmodified fragments and the modified fragment
ions (see Supporting Information, Figure
S3B). The MS2 data confirmed the selectivity of this reagent
toward arginine residues and their locations with high confidence.

Feasibility of Click-Chemistry-Based Peptide Enrichment
Next, we tested click labeling and biotin–avidin affinity
purification of CHD-Azide-modified peptides using a commercially available
biotin-PEG4-alkyne reagent. Biotin-PEG4-alkyne is not a suitable reagent
for peptide-level mass-spectrometric fragmentation because of poly(ethylene
glycol) (PEG) and biotin groups. This kind of reagent was widely used
for the enrichment of proteins. Because of the solubility, we decided
to use this reagent and to provide feasibility of affinity purification
at the peptide level. To test the feasibility, a substance P-modified
peptide was spiked in a mixture of myoglobin digest. After click labeling
in this complex mixture, we affinity-purified the peptide by avidin.
The base peak chromatogram (BPC) of spiked myoglobin digests and corresponding
BPC after CHD labeling and click enrichment are shown in Figure 3A,B, respectively.
We also searched the myoglobin peptides before and after enrichment
and found that a few myoglobin peptides were identified with reduced
PSMs in the enriched samples (Supporting Information, excel file). It is clearly shown that affinity purification significantly
reduced the MS data. Further analysis of MS/MS data clearly indicated
that CHD-modified peptide was successfully labeled by biotin-PEG4-alkyne.
MS/MS was performed on the [M + 2H]2+ ion at m/z 1012.88. The fragmentation behaviors of the click-modified
and affinity-purified peptide are shown in Figure 3 (see excel files for fragments m/z’s). The CHD-Azide-modified peptide containing
the clickable part gave most of the b fragment ions (Figure 3C). The modified fragment ion
series indicated that the addition is 457.58 Da, which corresponds
to the biotin-PEG4-alkyne attached to the CHD-Azide modification site.
This together with the unmodified ions b2, b7, b8, and b10 and CHD-modified
fragments b2*, b7*, b8*, and b10* (*-CHD-Azide-modified) as well as
the CHD-Azide-click-modified fragments b2#, b7#, b8#, and b10# (#-CHD-Azide-click-modified)
can be used to justify the modification at the arginine residue (Figure S4A,B). The mass difference between b2
and b2* is 219.14 Da, which clearly showed that the CHD-Azide modification
is at the arginine residue. The mass shift between b2* and b2# fragment
ion of the enriched peptide is 457.58 Da, giving a strong evidence
of the reaction of biotin-PEG4-alkyne with the azide group. As mentioned
before, biotin and PEG functionalities complicate the MS/MS fragmentation
spectra. Our future strategy is also to develop or use a cleavable
click reagent to remove these groups before MS analysis. The above
spiking studies clearly demonstrated the feasibility of click-chemistry-based
labeling and purification of arginine-modified peptides in a protein
digest.

From the outcome noted on the model peptides, we
decided to carry out the CHD-Azide modification reaction with an enzyme
RNase A. This model protein system was studied to demonstrate the
applicability of this chemical labeling method for locating functional
arginine residues in the enzyme.

Modification of RNase A
Protein by the CHD-Azide Compound
To identify the amino acids
modified by CHD-Azide, the digested peptides of the modified protein
sample were analyzed by nano LC–MS/MS. We were able to identify
the modified arginine residues in RNase A protein. Two amino acid
sequences were identified with the chemical modification at the arginine
residues. Specifically, we found two peaks at m/z 469.28 [M + 2H]2+ and m/z 1003.17 [M + 3H]3+, which corresponded to a
peptide with amino acid sequence SR*NLTK and a large peptide, DR*C!KPVNTFVHESLADVQAVC!SQK
(*-CHD-Azide modified, !-cysteine −SH blocked by carbamidomethylation)
with two carbamidomethyl modification at two cysteine residues, respectively.

To confirm the modification sites, we investigated the tandem MS
data of the CHD-Azide-treated RNase A protein. The results in Figure 4A demonstrated the
MS/MS fragmentation of the unmodified peptide SRNLTK. The difference
between untreated and treated RNase A peptide SRNLTK was 219.14 Da,
which suggested that Arg-33 was modified by CHD-Azide. As presented
in Figure 4B, the MS/MS
of the peptide SR*NLTK confirmed the Arg-33 modification by the CHD-Azide
compound. The precursor ion at m/z 469.93 that generated CID fragment ions corresponds to b2*-NH3, b3*, b4*, b5*, y1, y2, y3, y4, and y5*-H2O. In
addition, we saw that the unmodified peptide SRNLTK at m/z 360.90 gave fragment ions b4, b5, y1, y2, y3-H2O, and y6-NH3. A comparison of a fragment ion at m/z 471.27 (b4) of the unmodified peptide
with m/z 690.41 (b4*) of the modified
peptide SR*NLTK showed that the mass addition was 219.14 Da. Closer
examination of another fragment ion b5* of the modified peptide at m/z 791.45 with b5 of the unmodified peptide
at m/z 572.32 revealed the characteristic
mass addition of 219.13 Da. These data clearly suggested that the
CHD-Azide modification is at Arg-33. After click labeling, we observed
the modified peptides in the enriched sample at m/z 465.72. This is a small peptide and was observed
with +3 charge states with the tag. It has two serine and threonine
residues and contained a PEG biotin, so loss of water was anticipated
from the fragmented residues (Figure S6). However, we were able to confirm the modification on this arginine
residue. We observed #b23+ (#CHD-Azide and click-modified)
fragment with high intensity. The difference between this peak and
the *b2 (*-CHD-Azide-modified) is 456.44 Da, which corresponds to
the click-modified mass.

A peptides. (A) MS/MS spectrum of peptide SRNLTK at m/z 360.90 (M + 2H)2+. (B) MS/MS spectrum
of CHD-Azide-modified peptide SR*NLTK at m/z 469.93 (M + 2H + CHD-Az)2+. For example, the
difference between b4* and b4 corresponds to the addition of 219.14
Da, the CHD-Azide modification mass. * denotes CHD-Azide-modified
sites.

Under identical tandem MS conditions,
we saw Arg-39 modification in peptide DR*C!KPVNTFVHESLADVQAVC!SQK
(*-CHD-Azide, !-carbamidomethylation of cysteine) (Figure S7A). As expected, CID data of the precursor ion peak
at m/z 1003.17 produced few fragment
ions of this large peptide with several modifications. In this peptide,
the 219.16 Da increases in the peptide mass between the unmodified
peptide and CHD-Azide-modified peptide confirmed that the CHD-Azide
compound also modified Arg-39. The tandem MS data produced by both
sequences were matched against the molecular calculator software (omics.pnl.gov) to confirm the
identity of the peptides. After click chemistry labeling and affinity
purification by avidin, we have seen significant reduction of MS data
(see the BPC in Supporting Information S5, A and B). The most abundant b and y ions of peptide DR#C!KPVNTFVHESLADVQAVC!SQK
(# CHD-Azide click-modified after click modification) (Figure S7B) confirmed the modification at Arg-39.
Extracted ion chromatogram (XIC) and retention time of these modified
peptides were provided in pages 15–17 at the Supporting Information. However, the quality of the tandem
MS data was poor because of the incomplete fragmentation of this highly
modified large peptide and side-chain PEG and biotin group. As mentioned
earlier, PEG–biotin is a very good reagent for the purification
of modified proteins by biotin–avidin chromatography, but in
peptide label, their fragmentations complicate the tandem MS data.
Thus, cleavable biotinylated reagents to release the PEG and biotin
from the conjugated peptides are necessary to assign all fragment
ions.27,28 As displayed in Figure S7B, some of the b and y ions are absent or they occur at very
low intensity m/z values because
the peptide contained two carbamidomethyl-modified cysteine residues
along with the CHD-Azide-click modification. The difference between
click-modified fragment ion b173+ at m/z 882.56 (Figure S7B) and the CHD-Azide-modified b173+ at m/z 730.68 (Figure S7A) confirmed a mass addition of 457.58 Da, which corresponds to the
molecular weight (MW) of the biotinylated click reagent. Because of
the large tag, these peptides shifted to longer retention time. Retention
time and XIC for these peptides are provided in the Supporting Information pages 15–17.

Our data showed that Arg-39 and Arg-33 are the most reactive
arginine residues present in RNase A. Functional probing of arginine
residues in RNase A protein was done previously. This labeling study
will pinpoint solvent-accessible arginine residues and their local
environment. If there are strong interactions with other residues,
they will not be available for reactions. Our findings agreed with
Laszlo Patthy’s studies on the identification of functional
arginine residues in RNase A and lysozyme.29 The data also agreed with Brock et al. mass spectrometric studies
on the detection and identification of arginine modifications on methylglyoxal-modified
ribonuclease.30 These findings were displayed
with the crystal structure of RNase A protein with all arginine residues
and the selective arginine residues labeled and enriched with our
CHD-Azide and bio-orthogonal chemical labeling strategy (Figure 5A,B).

RNase A protein (PDB file 4J5Z). (A) All arginine residues in RNase A. (B) Modified
sites of RNase A with CHD-Azide.

Another challenge associated with the CHD-type compounds
is the high pH reaction condition. Several researchers frequently
used CHD because of its superior labeling efficiency compared to phenyl
and methylglyoxal. Fortunately, it is found that even with high pH
reaction environment, it is quite capable of labeling functional arginine
residues.29,31,32 Screening
the reactive residues will also help in understanding the targets,
which will be utilized further for activity assays. We believe that
this structural information will be extremely useful for the structural
biologist for further exploration of new enzyme activities by mutating
these residues.

Conclusions
In this study, we utilized
a chemical labeling approach for evaluating selective purification
of reactive arginine residues in proteins. To the best of our knowledge,
for the first time, we developed an arginine-selective reagent with
enrichment functionality utilizing a cyclic 1,2 dicarbonyl compound.
We incorporated an azido group in 1,2 CHD so that arginine-labeled
peptides can be enriched with a clickable biotinylated reagent. We
tested the chemical labeling methods in several standard peptides
with arginine residues in different positions in the sequence. Complete
labeling was observed in those peptides. We demonstrated affinity
purification with a commercially available clickable biotinylated
reagent. A peptide spiked in a protein digest was successfully affinity-purified
after click labeling. Furthermore, we tested the labeling efficiency
of this reagent on RNase A protein to identify and validate the reactive
arginine residues. Two functional arginine residues were selectively
modified and click-labeled using this approach. We utilized a commercially
available clickable biotinylated reagent to evaluate the chemical
labeling of CHD-Azide-labeled peptides. Because of PEG and biotin
functionality in this compound, we have seen poor fragmentation in
the click-modified large and small peptides. Nevertheless, we have
successfully demonstrated the attachment of CHD-Azide and click adducts
after affinity purification. We are in the process of employing a
cleavable clickable biotinylated reagent so that the modified peptide
can be removed from the avidin beads by chemical cleavage. Thus, fragmentation
complexity can be reduced from the click-labeled mass spectra. In
this study, we provided a proof-of-concept of an arginine-selective
reagent with enrichment functionality for identifying reactive arginine
residues in large-scale samples. Our approach demonstrated that CHD-Azide
labeling and click-based enrichment method is a reliable analytical
technique to determine the reactive/functional arginine residues.
We believe this study will pinpoint the reactive arginine targets
with high confidence for studying protein structures and biomarker
identifications.

Sample Preparation
Chemical Modification of Arginine Residues
in Peptides
Bradykinin, neurotensin, and substance P were
purchased from AnaSpec (Fremont, CA). Recently, we have reported an
assessment of chemical labeling method to identify functional/reactive
arginine residues of proteins by MS utilizing two widely used arginine-reactive
reagents.22 We followed the same labeling
protocol mentioned in our recently published article.22 For each peptide sample (1 mM, 5 μL), we added 5
μL of 30 mM CHD-Azide reagent in 200 mM sodium hydroxide solution.
The reaction was allowed to continue for 2 h at 37 °C under agitation.
After the reaction, the samples were dried in a SpeedVac at 30 °C
for 1 h. The two dried samples were then reconstituted in 0.1% FA.
After that, samples were vortexed and desalted using Thermo Scientific
Pierce C18 tips. Desalted samples were then used for the analysis
after diluting with 1:1 MeOH/H2O with 2% acetic acid.

Chemical Modification of Arginine Residues in Proteins
Protein
was reduced and alkylated using 2 μL of 10 mM dithiothreitol
(Bio-Rad, CA) and 10 μL of 10 mM IAM (Sigma-Aldrich, MO), respectively.
The sample was then diluted with 200 mM sodium hydroxide, followed
by the addition of 5 μL of 30 mM CHD-Azide solution. The reaction
was carried out at 37 °C for 24 h.

Samples were transferred
into the pierce concentrators (3 kDa MWCO) for centrifugal ultrafiltration
to remove the excess CHD-Azide reagent. Cleared protein samples were
digested with trypsin, using 1:100 enzyme-to-protein ratio, for 16
h at 37 °C with frequent mixing.

After trypsin digestion,
the peptide mixture was fully dried and reconstituted in PBS buffer.
At the same time, the azide-containing peptide sample was prepared
for the click chemistry reaction by adding 2 μL of 100 mM water-soluble
tris(3-hydroxypropyltriazolylmethyl)amine click ligand, 400 μL
of 50 mM CuSO4, and 80 μL of 50 mM Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine.24 Click reagent biotin-PEG4-alkyne was added in
a 1:20 molar ratio of peptide and allowed to react for 2 h at room
temperature in a rotor.

The click-labeled sample was then incubated
with 30 μL of monomeric avidin beads. Prior to incubation, the
avidin beads were washed thrice with 1× PBS buffer. The sample
was then incubated with the avidin beads at room temperature for 4
h. The beads were washed again thrice with PBS buffer, twice with
25 mM NaCl, and thrice with water. Finally, the captured peptides
were eluted from the avidin beads using the elution solution, which
contained 50:50 acetonitrile/H2O and 0.4% trifluoroacetic
acid (TFA).

Feasibility of Click-Chemistry-Based Peptide
Enrichment
To study the feasibility of click-chemistry-based
peptide enrichment, we performed a spiking study. The CHD-Azide-modified
substance P (1 mM, 5 μL) was spiked into a tryptic digest of
myoglobin (1 mM, 5 μL). After the click-labeling reaction, the
CHD-Azide-modified peptides were captured by avidin beads following
the same protocol mentioned above. Then, the click-labeled biotinylated
peptide was eluted using the same elution solution containing 50%
acetonitrile/50% H2O and 0.4% TFA.

Instrument Setup
The samples were analyzed using a Thermo Scientific Velos Pro dual-pressure
linear ion trap mass spectrometer operated in a positive-ion mode
and controlled by Xcalibur software (Thermo Fisher Scientific, San
Jose, CA, USA). Peptides were loaded onto a nanoViper Acclaim PepMap
C18 column with an inner diameter of 75 μm, a particle size
of 2 μm, a pore size of 100 Å, and a length of 15 cm bed
for separation. Reverse-phase chromatographic separations of the loaded
peptides were performed on a Dionex Ultimate 3000 RSLC nanochromatography
(Thermo Fisher Scientific) system across a 65 min run with a flow
rate of 300 nL/min. A multistep gradient was used, which consisted
of 4% B for 3 min, 4–30% B for 30 min, 30–60% B for
55 min (A, 0.1% FA in water; B, 95%: 5%: 0.1% acetonitrile: water:
FA).

The mass spectrometer was operated in normal scan modes,
and a full MS spectrum was obtained. Peptides were identified in data-dependent
acquisition (DDA) mode to obtain the tandem mass spectra (MS/MS) for
the 10 most abundant ions (collision energy of 40, activation Q of
0.25, and activation time of 10 ms). In DDA analysis, singly charged
ions were rejected. To observe the fragmentation behavior of the CHD-Azide
modification at the peptide level, a direct infusion analysis was
performed for untreated and CHD-Azide-treated peptide samples using
ESI-thermo Velos-MS. The HESI source was operated in the positive-ion
mode using ESI probe voltage at 2.5 kV, a capillary temperature of
250 °C, sheath gas = 5, and S-lens RF = 62. Before injection,
the peptide samples were diluted with 1:1 MeOH/H2O: 2%
acetic acid and were injected into the mass spectrometer through the
syringe pump.

Identification of CHD-Azide Adducts
The software Proteome Discoverer (version 1.3, Thermo Scientific,
USA) was used to extract mass spectral data and search them against
RNase A sequence (Uniprot P02769). Trypsin was selected as the cleaving
proteases, allowing a maximum of three missed cleavages. Peptide and
fragment-ion tolerances were set to 5 ppm and 0.7 Da, respectively.
Cysteine carbamidomethylation was set as fix modification (+57.02147).
The MS/MS spectra of modified peptides were manually inspected for
the confident mapping of the modification sites.

Synthesis
Detailed synthesis is described in the supplementary sections with
NMR, IR, and high-resolution MS data. Briefly, 1,6-dibromohexane was
first reacted with p-methoxy benzyl alcohol, under
basic conditions, to prepare 1-((6-bromohexyloxy)methyl)-4-methoxybenzene.
After this, 4-(6-((4-methoxybenzyl)oxy)hexyl)-2-oxocyclohexyl acetate
was synthesized by coupling 2-oxocyclohex-3-en-1-yl acetate with the
freshly prepared ((6-bromohexyloxy)methyl)-4-methoxybenzene. This
new coupling product was deprotected under oxidative conditions to
expose its terminal hydroxyl group, which was tosylated and subsequently
substituted with sodium azide to produce the expected alkyl azide
intermediate. Finally, an acetyl deprotection was performed, followed
by a Swern oxidation reaction to produce the CHD-Azide final compound
(see Supporting Information data, pages
11–14).
