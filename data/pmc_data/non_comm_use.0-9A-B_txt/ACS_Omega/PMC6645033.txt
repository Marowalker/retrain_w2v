A series of 3,5-disubstituted 1,4-dihydropyridine
derivatives including
the derivative with two chiral centers, 6H (R2 = CH3, CH2Ph), as a new type of organic hydride
source were synthesized and characterized. The thermodynamic driving
forces (defined as enthalpy changes or standard redox potentials)
of the 6 elementary steps for the organic hydrides to release hydride
ions in acetonitrile were measured by isothermal titration calorimetry
and electrochemical methods. The impacts of the substituents and functional
groups bearing the N1 and C3/C5 positions on the thermodynamic driving
forces of the 6 elementary steps were examined and analyzed. Moreover,
the results showed that the reaction mechanism between the chiral
organic hydride and activated ketone (ethyl benzoylformate) was identified
as the concerted hydride transfer pathway based on the thermodynamic
analysis platform. These valuable and crucial thermodynamic parameters
will provide a broadly beneficial impact on the applications of 3,5-disubstituted
1,4-dihydropyridine derivatives in organic synthesis and pharmaceutical
chemistry.

Introduction
Organic hydrides (also
called as metal-free hydrides) are one of
the most important organic compounds that can provide a hydride ion
to the reaction partner in chemical reactions.1−4 Because of having many special
chemical properties compared with the metal hydrides (also called
as inorganic hydrides, such as KH, NaH, NaBH4, LiAlH4, etc), organic hydrides have been receiving extensive applications
in biomimetic chemistry,5,6 organic synthetic chemistry,7,8 energy chemistry,9 green chemistry,10,11 materials chemistry,12,13 and many others.14 Below are listed some representative examples (Scheme 1). N-Benzyl-1,4-dihydronicotinamide (BNAH) is a well-known organic hydride.
Because of having the same core structure with NADH coenzyme, BNAH
has been widely used as the model of NADH coenzyme to examine the
mechanism of NADH oxidation in vivo.15−25 Hantzsch ester (3,5-diesters substituted 1,4-dihydropyridine, HEH)
is a typical organic hydride. Because of easily releasing one hydrogen
molecule or two hydrogen atoms, Hantzsch ester has been extensively
used as reducing agent to make aldehydes, ketones, imines, alkenes,
and ketoesters become the corresponding saturated forms.26−30N-Methyl-9,10-dihydronacridine (AcrH2) is also another well-known organic hydride. Owing to possess very
good fluorescence properties, AcrH2 has been widely used
in optical materials.31,32 In recent years, the 3,5-disubstituted
1,4-dihydropyridine derivatives have drawn great attention33−37 because these compounds have shown versatile applications in organic
synthesis, particularly in asymmetric synthesis. For example, various
activated ketones (the activated ketones were defined as strong electron-withdrawing
groups attached to the carbonyl group in this work) could be asymmetric
reduced to chiral alcohols in acetonitrile at room temperature by
using the (l)-valine derivated 3,5-disubstituted 1,4-dihydropyridine
(6H, R2 = CH3) via hydride transfer
manner in the presence of MgClO4·1.5H2O.38−41

Scheme 1 Structures of the Three Well-Known Organic Hydride Donors (BNAH,
HEH, and AcrH2)
Although organic hydrides have received extensive attention,
the
focus of many chemists is mainly on the applications, the reports
on the thermodynamic driving forces to scale their hydride-donating
ability, especially the thermodynamic driving forces of elementary
steps to evaluate the mechanism of hydride transfer reactions in solution
have so far been scarce (Scheme 2).42−44 Because the development of the potential applications
of organic hydrides demands the guidance of the related thermodynamic
parameters in solution, evidently it should be an urgent task for
chemists to acquire those exact values.

Scheme 2 Six Elementary Steps
of 3,5-Disubstituted 1,4-Dihydropyridines (XH) To Release
Hydride Anions
As our continuous
interest in the determination of the thermodynamic
parameters of organic hydrides to release hydride anions,45−50 in this paper, we have synthesized a new type of organic hydrides
(XH), namely 3,5-disubstituted 1,4-dihydropyridine compounds
as shown in Scheme 3, and the related thermodynamic driving forces for 6 elementary steps
[ΔHH–D(XH),
ΔHHD(XH), ΔHHD(XH•+), ΔHPD(XH•+), Eox(XH), and Eox(X•)] in acetonitrile were systematically
measured (Scheme 2). 1   2   3   4

Results
The oxidation
potentials of 3,5-disubstituted 1,4-dihydropyridines
(XH) and reduction potentials of the cations (X+) were detected by using the electrochemical
method, including cyclic voltammetry (CV) and Osteryoung square wave
voltammetry (OSWV) in acetonitrile at 298 K (Figure 1, SI-3).46 Molar reaction enthalpy changes (ΔHrxn) of hydride transfer from 3,5-disubstituted
1,4-dihydropyridines (XH) to PhXn+ClO4– (eq 3) were measured by using isothermal titration calorimetry
(ITC) in acetonitrile at 298 K (Figure 2, SI-4).46 The detailed experimental results were summarized in Table 1.

was repeated at least three times and reproducible to
±0.05 kcal mol–1.

b Eox(XH) and Eox(X•) (V vs Fc+/0) were reproducible
to 5 mV or better. Note: 5H, 7H were reacted
with TEMPO+ClO4– instead of
PhXn+ClO4– for driving the
reaction to total completion.

The definition for the thermodynamic driving forces of XH to release hydride anions in acetonitrile was formulated as the
molar enthalpy changes ΔHH–D(XH) as shown in eqs 1 and 2,46 which could be easily accessed from eq 4. In eq 4, the values of ΔHrxn are listed
in Table 1, while ΔHH–A (PhXn+) is the hydride affinity of PhXn+ClO4– (−96.8 kcal mol–1) in
acetonitrile at 298 K.51

Besides
these 3 elementary steps thermodynamic parameters [ΔHH–D(XH), Eox(XH), and Eox(X•)], the remained 3
thermodynamic parameters are also defined as the relevant enthalpy
changes of XH to release hydrogen atoms ΔHHD(XH), the radical cation intermediates XH•+ to release hydrogen atoms
ΔHHD(XH•+), and protons ΔHPD(XH•+) in acetonitrile, respectively.46 Because these values could not be measured by
the experimental technique directly, our group designed a three thermodynamic
cycles based on the possible hydride transfer process of 3,5-disubstituted
1,4-dihydropyridines in acetonitrile at 298 K (Scheme 4). 5   6   7  

Scheme 4 Construction of Three Thermodynamic Cycles for 3,5-Disubstituted
1,4-Dihydropyridines (XH) and Their Related Intermediates
in Acetonitrile
According to the thermodynamic
cycles and Hess’s law, eqs 5–7 were well established.52 In eqs 5–7, Eoxo(XH) and Eoxo(X•) are the standard oxidation potentials
of XH and X• in acetonitrile, which were adopted the OSWV values instead of CV
values as they were closer to the standard redox potentials. Eo(H0/–) = −1.137
(V vs Fc+/0) and Eo(H+/0) = −2.307 (V vs Fc+0) are known
data and available from the literature.53 ΔHH–D(XH)
could be calculated from eq 4 as mentioned above. Notably, it was feasible to achieve the
detailed values of ΔHHD(XH), ΔHHD(XH•+), and ΔHPD(XH•+) of the 3,5-disubstituted
1,4-dihydropyridines in acetonitrile and they are readily summarized
in Table 2.

Discussion
Thermodynamic Driving Forces of 3,5-Disubstituted
1,4-Dihydropyridines
(XH) To Release Hydride Ions in Acetonitrile
ΔHH–D(XH) is
an intrinsic thermodynamic parameter to evaluate the hydride-donating
abilities of 3,5-disubstituted 1,4-dihydropyridines. Overall, the
enthalpy changes range from 66.5 kcal mol–1 for 6H (R2 = CH3) to 79.5 kcal mol–1 for 7H (R1 = p-H) (Table 2). The relative large
span (13 kcal mol–1) constituted a diverse organic
hydrides library, which could be further adjusted via structural modification.
The energy gap between 25 XH was extremely related to
the substituent effect at N1 position and structural variants at C3/C5
positions. The substituents attached to the benzyl group exhibited
a minor effect for the hydride-donating abilities of 3,5-disubstituted
1,4-dihydropyridine derivatives. Strong electron-donating group (p-OCH3) can slightly improve the hydride-donating
ability as compared with the remarkable electron-withdrawing group
(p-CN) (Table 2). Replacement of methyl group by benzyl group at N1 position
decreased hydride-donating abilities by 3.7 kcal mol–1 [6H (R2 = CH3) vs (R2 = CH2Ph), Table 2]. It is not unexpected because the benzyl group possessed
stronger electron-withdrawing ability than the methyl group. Importantly,
the hydride-donating abilities for the nonbridged and bridged XH did not display obvious differences, which meant that the
ring structure did not affect the thermodynamic driving forces of
releasing hydride anions [1H–3H (R1 = p-H) vs 6H (R2 = CH2Ph) and 4H (R1 = p-H) vs 5H, Table 2]. In this context, these results provided some implications
for chemists that introducing chiral groups on the bridged ring would
not interfere with the hydride-donating ability of XH, thus enabling us to design more elegant chiral groups on the bridged
ring structure of XH in order to further improve the
enantioselectivity, but did not worry about exerting influence on
the reductive capability. Additionally, the variants of C3/C5 functional
groups allowed us to closely investigate the structure–reactivity
relationship of these organic hydrides. The electron-withdrawing abilities
of 3,5-disubstituted functional groups are undoubtedly in the sequence
of −CN > −COCH3 > −CO2C2H5 > −CONH2. Because
the stronger
electron-withdrawing groups would decrease the stability of the corresponding
pyridine-type cations after releasing hydride anions; therefore, the
abilities of the 3,5-disubstituted 1,4-dihydropyridines to donate
hydride anions are extremely reserved with this trend and resulted
in the order of 7H < 8H < 4H < 1H.

It is important to mention here that
the thermodynamic scale was established to provide a straight-forward
pathway to compare the hydride-donating abilities between 3,5-disubstituted
1,4-dihydropyridines and other common NADH analogues (BNAH, HEH, and
AcrH2) in acetonitrile. The 3,5-disubstituted 1,4-dihydropyridines
in our system were selected the N1 positions with methyl and benzyl
groups in order to make consistent with BNAH, HEH, and AcrH2.

As shown in Figure 3, the enthalpy changes of the 3,5-disubstituted 1,4-dihydropyridines
(XH) are located at the middle of the scale. The abilities
of all 3,5-disubstituted 1,4-dihydropyridines to release hydrides
were inferior to the BNAH (64.2 kcal mol–1),46 but stronger than the AcrH2 (81.1
kcal mol–1).46 However,
all of 3,5-disubstituted 1,4-dihydropyridine organic hydrides are
weaker than the widely used inorganic hydrides, such as LiAlH4 (48 kcal mol–1)55,56 and NaBH4 (55 kcal mol–1).55,56 Among them, the enthalpy changes of 6H (R2 = CH3) are close with that of BNAH, indicating that it
is a strong organic hydride reductant. Meanwhile, most of the 3,5-disubstituted
1,4-dihydropyridine organic hydrides [1H–5H, 6H (R2 = CH2Ph)] are concentrated on
the enthalpy changes from 68.5 to 71.6 kcal mol–1, which are similar to that of HEH (69.3 kcal mol–1),46 and could also be referred to as
strong organic hydrides. In theory, these organic hydrides have the
potential to replace HEH as ideal reductants in organic catalysis
and synthesis, especially for 5H, which could be employed
as an effective reductant in the asymmetric reaction if some chiral
groups are introduced on the bridged ring.57 In contrast, the stronger electron-withdrawing groups at the C3/C5
positions (7H, 8H) lead to a significant
decrease of the hydride-donating abilities, which are close to AcrH2, classified as the moderate organic hydrides. More interestingly,
although the reductive abilities for 3,5-disubstituted 1,4-dihydropyridines
were weaker than the BNAH, they were not encountered with side reactions,
such as hydrated and addition to the carbonyl group in terms of ketone
reduction.58 Hence, these 3,5-disubstituted
1,4-dihydropyridines perform a good balance between their stabilities
and reactivities and serve as suitable reducing agents.

Figure 3 Hydride-donating
abilities scale for 3,5-disubstituted 1,4-dihydropyridines
and other common organic hydrides in acetonitrile.

Thermodynamic Driving Forces of the 3,5-Disubstituted
1,4-Dihydropyridines
(XH) To Release Hydrogen Atoms in Acetonitrile
As shown in Table 2, the enthalpy changes ΔHHD(XH) of 3,5-disubstituted 1,4-dihydropyridines to release hydrogen
atoms in acetonitrile range from the strongest 70.7 kcal mol–1 for 6H (R2 = CH3) to weakest
74.0 kcal mol–1 for 8H. The relative
narrow span indicated that the hydrogen-donating ability is not sensitive
to the structural changes both at N1 and C3/C5 positions. The enthalpy
changes of 3,5-disubstituted 1,4-dihydropyridines for delivering hydrogen
atoms were similar to those of BNAH (70.7 kcal mol–1),46 TEMPOH (71.2 kcal mol–1),59 and AcrH2 (73.0 kcal mol–1),46 but remarkably lower
than those of common hydrogen atom donors, such as vitamin E (80.9
kcal mol–1)60 and BHT
(81.6 kcal mol–1),59 illustrating
that they are good to excellent hydrogen atom donors. It is further
proved by the facts that they have the potential abilities to quench
some typical radicals, such as (CN) (CH3)2C• (isobutyronitrile radical generated by AIBN, 91.9
kcal mol–1),61 PhC(O)O• (benzoyl radical generated by BPO, 111 kcal mol–1),62 i-C3H7OO• (85.1 kcal mol–1),63 and PhS• (83.5 kcal mol–1),64 which could be used
as the antioxidants. Evidently, it may be concluded that these 3,5-disubstituted
1,4-dihydropyridines exhibited the strong abilities to donate hydride
anions and hydrogen atoms in acetonitrile. However, for the real transfer
process, it should be analyzed by consideration of both hydride donors
and hydride acceptors.

Thermodynamic Driving Forces of the 3,5-Disubstituted
1,4-Dihydropyridine
Radical Cations (XH•+)
To Release Hydrogen Atoms in Acetonitrile
Hydride transfer
initiated by electron transfer would generate radical cations (XH•+), which are the most important
intermediates for organic hydrides. However, research based on capturing
and analyzing the intermediates is not easy because of the short life
time and considerably reactive features of these intermediates, even
by the aid of advanced instruments and techniques. Through our thermodynamic
cycles (Scheme 4),
the thermodynamic driving forces of the radical cations to release
hydrogen atoms ΔHHD(XH•+) could be obtained, which was very
useful to understand their chemical properties and help to diagnose
the hydride transfer mechanisms. The enthalpy changes ΔHHD(XH•+) span from 30.7 kcal mol–1 for 4H (R1 = p-OCH3) to 36.8 kcal
mol–1 for 7H (Table 2). The relatively narrow energy gap (6.1
kcal mol–1) implied that the hydrogen-donating abilities
of 3,5-disubstituted 1,4-dihydropyridine radical cations are less
sensitive to the remote substituent effect at N1 positions and structural
variants at C3/C5 positions. The radical cations of XH•+ are unstable in the air and prefer
to deliver hydrogen atoms to other active radical species as a result
of comparison with HOO• (48.3 kcal mol–1) in acetonitrile.65

Thermodynamic
Driving Forces of the 3,5-Disubstituted 1,4-Dihydropyridine
Radical Cations (XH•+)
To Release Protons in Acetonitrile
The enthalpy changes ΔHPD(XH•+) for the radical cations to release protons range from −0.2
kcal mol–1 for 7H to 11.1 kcal mol–1 for 2H (R1 = p-CN) (Table 2). The
outcomes showed that the values are more sensitive to the variation
at C3/C5 positions, but small effect imposed by the remote substituents
on the benzyl group. For examples, 1H (R1 = p-H) and (R1 = p-Br) as well
as 2H (R1 = p-Br) and (R1 = p-CN) gave the same enthalpy changes.
All the enthalpy changes for XH•+ to release protons are smaller than BNAH•+ (12.4 kcal mol–1),46 indicating that other electron-withdrawing groups at C5 positions
increased their acidities. Moreover, the acidities of these radical
cations are extremely stronger than acetic acid (30.4 kcal mol–1) and66 trifluoroacetic
acid (22.4 kcal mol–1) in acetonitrile,67 and 4H•+, 5H•+, 7H•+, 8H•+ are even greater than hydrobromic acid (7.5 kcal mol–1) in acetonitrile.68 Therefore, the 3,5-disubstituted
1,4-dihydropyridine radical cations (XH•+) are identified as strong acids. Because the intermediates
(XH•+) are preferred to
deliver protons instead of hydrogen atoms (smaller enthalpy changes
for proton transfer), if hydride transfer is triggered by the electron
transfer, the intermediates (XH•+) could rapidly undergo degradation process via proton transfer
(e–H+–e) instead of hydrogen transfer. Particularly
interesting example is the intermediate 7H•+; the spontaneous proton transfer process was
proposed to take place as proof by the negative value of enthalpy
change (−0.2 kcal mol–1). These findings
suggested that 3,5-disubstituted 1,4-dihydropyridines could be used
as the proton and electron sources in the proton-coupled electron
transfer reaction upon initiation by photocatalysis, which is the
hot research area in organic synthesis.69

Thermodynamic Driving Forces of 3,5-Disubstituted 1,4-Dihydropyridines
(XH) To Release Electrons in Acetonitrile
The
standard oxidation potential Eox(XH) of the 3,5-disubstituted 1,4-dihydropyridines (XH) is an essential and crucial electrochemical parameter to evaluate
the single-electron oxidation behavior in acetonitrile. The indicators
of the electron-donating abilities were determined by OSWV method
because of their irreversible oxidation process, suggesting that the
intermediates after donating a single electron were unstable and rapid
degradation to other species. All the hydride donors exhibited the
oxidation potentials in the scope from 0.338 (V vs Fc+/0) for 3H (R1 = p-OCH3) to 0.861 (V vs Fc+/0) for 7H as
shown in Table 1. The
values are positive than ferrocene, indicating that the 3,5-disubstituted
1,4-dihydropyridines are remarkably reluctant one-electron donors.
The electron-withdrawing groups at the C3/C5 positions are tightly
related to their oxidation potentials. The increased electron-withdrawing
abilities of −CN > −COCH3 > −CO2C2H5 > −CONH2 >
−CONHMe
> −CONHC4H9 resulted in the decreased
abilities of XH to release electrons (Table 1). The substrates with electron-donating
substituent on the benzyl group (p-OCH3) presented stronger electron-donating abilities than the electron-withdrawing
substituent (p-CN). Similarly, the nonbridged or
bridged structures do not alter the electron-donating abilities [1H–3H (R1 = p-H) vs 6H (R2 = CH2Ph) and 4H (R1 = p-H) vs 5H, Table 1].

In Figure 4, the electron-donating abilities
of the 3,5-disubstituted 1,4-dihydropyridines and other common hydride
donors were intuitively compared. The single electron-donating abilities
for 1H–3H and 6H are situated between
BNAH (0.219 V vs Fc+/0) and HEH (0.479 V vs Fc+/0),46 which are classified as moderate-to-weak
single-electron reductants, but 4H–5H and 7H–8H are remarkably larger than HEH, indicating that
they are extremely weak single-electron reductants. Although the presence
of the second electron-withdrawing groups at C5 position decreased
their single-electron transfer abilities, it led to improve their
stabilities toward hydration and oxidation.70

Thermodynamic Driving Forces
of the 3,5-Disubstituted Pyridine-Type
Radicals (X•) To Release
Electrons in Acetonitrile
Because the highly reactive radicals X• could not be obtained, the
determination of their oxidation potentials Eox(X•) was realized
by detection of the reduction potentials of X+, which were also available from the OSWV method because
of their irreversibilities. The reduction potentials for cations (X+) distributed between −1.318
(V vs Fc+/0) for 6+ (R2 = CH3) and −0.707 (V vs Fc+/0) for 7+ (Table 1), which means that
they are relatively difficult to be reduced. In other words, the neutral
radicals (X•) are preferred
to release one electron and assigned as strong single-electron reducing
agents. All the electron-withdrawing substituents (−CN, −Br)
on the benzyl group could partially stabilize the X•, suggesting that the radicals (X•) are relatively electron-rich
and electron-donating substituents could easily cause oxidation. This
rule was significantly reflected by the functional groups at C3/C5
positions. The strongest electron-withdrawing group (cyano) decreased
the electron-donating ability of 7• as compared with the contributions of other functional groups
(ester, ketone, and amide). The comparative results reflected that
our data were reliable and consistent with the solely reported example 1+ (R1 = p-H). The reduction potential for the 1+ (R1 = p-H) was measured as −1.31
(V vs Fc+/0) in this work, according to the CV value with
platinum electrolyte in acetonitrile, while a similar result was found
for 1+ (R1 = p-H) as −1.35 (V vs SCE) according to the CV value
with mercury electrolyte in pH = 9 aqueous medium.71 Interestingly, for the series of 1+–6+, the
reduction potentials are close to or even more negative than molecular
oxygen (−1.050 V vs Fc+/0).72 Hence, it could be concluded that the neutral radicals (X•) could not survive under oxygen
saturated solution. Thus, if the neutral radicals (X•) are in need of detection during the
reaction process, oxygen should be strictly excluded from the reaction
system.

Diagnoses of Hydride Transfer Mechanisms from 3,5-Disubstituted
1,4-Dihydropyridines (XH) to Hydride Acceptors
The observed hydride transfer from donor to acceptor should include
three possible reaction mechanisms, namely initiated by hydride transfer,
hydrogen transfer, and electron transfer. Because thermodynamics could
provide reliable evidence to judge the possibilities of hydride transfer
reactions, the thermodynamic analysis platform was constructed with
the thermodynamic parameters of the 6 elementary steps of hydride
donors and acceptors.73 In order to deeply
understand the reduction mechanisms between organic hydrides and carbonyl
groups, we chose chiral organic hydride 6H (R2 = CH3) as the hydride donor and ethyl benzoylformate
as the hydride acceptor to elucidate the detailed reaction mechanisms
according to the thermodynamic analysis platform, which so far has
remained unclear in Kellogg’s work.39,40

Among them, the thermodynamic driving forces for 6 elementary
steps of 6H (R2 = CH3) have been
already established; the hydride affinity, hydrogen affinity, and
electron affinity of ethyl benzoylformate, as well as their corresponding
intermediates could be measured by using previous method.51 The hydride affinity of ethyl benzoylformate
ΔHH–A(A) was
emerged as −77.6 kcal mol–1 in acetonitrile
according to the hydride transfer reaction heat (ΔHrxn) from ITC by treating ethyl mandelate anion (ethyl
mandelate anion was generated by deprotonation of ethyl mandelate
with KH) with TEMPO+ClO4– [ΔHH–A(A) = ΔHH–A(TEMPO+) + ΔHrxn, eqs S1–S4, SI-5]. The reduction potential for ethyl benzoylformate
was reversible and recorded as Ered(A) = −1.731 (V vs Fc+/0) according to the CV value. The oxidation potential for
the ethyl mandelate anion adopted the OSWV value as Eox(AH–) = 0.791 (V vs Fc+/0) because of its irreversibility. According to the Hess’s
law and eqs 5–7, the hydrogen affinity ΔHHA(A) of ethyl benzoylformate and the hydrogen
affinity ΔHHA(A•) and proton affinity ΔHPA(A•) of
ethyl benzoylformate radical were calculated as −34.8, −91.3,
and −21.4 kcal mol–1, respectively. All the
values for the 6 thermodynamic parameters of 6H (R2 = CH3) and ethyl benzoylformate were readily available
and the reaction mechanism could be comprehensively elucidated via
the thermodynamic analysis platform (eqs S5–S10, SI-5; Scheme 5).

Scheme 5 Use of Thermodynamic Analysis Platform To Diagnose
the Possible Hydride
Transfer Mechanisms between 6H (R2 = CH3) and
Ethyl Benzoylformate
The reduction initiated by electron transfer (step a)
and hydrogen
transfer (step b) from 6H (R2 = CH3) to ethyl benzoylformate is highly impossible because of the thermodynamic
inhibition over 35.9 kcal mol–1. In contrast, a
concerted hydride transfer manner (step c) is preferred to take place
spontaneously, even though the thermodynamic driving force is limited
to 11.1 kcal mol–1. The small thermodynamic value
suggested that the hydride transfer process could be slowly in acetonitrile
at 298 K. In fact, the experiment process showed that the asymmetric
reduction of carbonyl group by 6H (R2 = CH3) in the presence of MgClO4·1.5H2O as Lewis acid was very slow and required 3–5 days for completing
the conversion. These results clearly proved that the hydride transfer
(step c) governed the reaction conversion and was assumed as the rate
determining step. However, the 6H (R2 = CH3) could not reduce other inactivated ketones (normal ketones,
such as acetone, acetophenone, and so on) via the hydride transfer
process because the thermodynamic driving force was not permitted
as shown in Table S1 (SI-5). If it worked,
other additives, such as strong Lewis acids or phosphoric acids, are
demanded to activate the carbonyl group (C=O). In this regard,
these findings allow us to deeply understand the properties of C=O
π bonds for different carbonyl compounds.

Conclusions
In this work, a series of 3,5-disubstituted 1,4-dihydropyridines
have been successfully synthesized and they are constituted as a broad
scope of organic hydride donors. The thermodynamic driving forces
of each elementary-step for the hydride donors in acetonitrile were
realized by experimental techniques and thermodynamic cycles, which
allowed us to understand their reductive abilities qualitatively and
learn about the properties of related intermediates. Thermodynamic
values suggested that the 3,5-disubstituted 1,4-dihydropyridines belong
to moderate to strong hydride donors and moderate to weak single-electron
donors as compared with the conventional biomimic hydride donors (BNAH,
HEH, and AcrH2). The para-substituents on the benzene ring
bearing at the N1 positions have relatively minor influence on the
reducing capabilities. In contrast, the functional groups attached
on the C3/C5 positions exhibited visible effect for the hydride-donating
as well as single-electron-donating abilities. The mechanism between
the chiral organic hydride 6H (R2 = CH3) and activated ketone (ethyl benzoylformate) has been first
verified as the concerted hydride transfer pathway depended on the
thermodynamic analysis platform. All the valuable thermodynamic parameters
are essential and crucial to understand the reducing capabilities
of the 3,5-disubstituted 1,4-dihydropyridines, offering guidance for
chemists to design other novel chiral and nonchiral 3,5-disubstituted
1,4-dihydropyridine derivatives.

Experimental Section
Materials
The target 3,5-disubstituted 1,4-dihydropyridine
compounds (XH, X = 1–8) were synthesized and identified by 1H NMR. The detailed
synthetic procedures and related references are provided in the Supporting Information (SI-1, 2). Reagent-grade
acetonitrile and tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate were purchased
from Aldrich. Acetonitrile was treated with potassium permanganate
and potassium carbonate and refluxed for several hours. Then, it was
redistilled over phosphoric anhydride under an argon atmosphere before
use. Tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate was recrystallized from
dichloromethane and dried under vacuum at 383 K for overnight.46

Electrochemical Experiment
The electrochemical
experiments
were carried out using an electrochemical apparatus (BAS-100B) with
a standard three-electrode cell. All the compounds were measured in
acetonitrile under an argon atmosphere at 298 K with ferrocenium/ferrocene
as the internal standard, a glassy carbon disk as the working electrode,
a platinum wire as the counter electrode, and 0.1 M silver nitrate/silver
(containing 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate in acetonitrile)
as the reference electrode.50 The sweep
rate was 100 mV s–1 in this work.

Isothermal
Titration Calorimetry
The titration experiments
were conducted on an isothermal titration calorimeter (CSC4200) in
acetonitrile at 298 K. The hydride donor and acceptor were dissolved
in the acetonitrile with certain concentration. Injection of hydride
donor (10 μL) into acceptor was delivered in 0.5 s. The time
interval between two injections was 400 s, and the injection was repeated
over 10 times for each spectrum. The reaction heat was calculated
by integration of each peak except for the first one, which was lower
than the normal due to the diffusion during the pre-equilibrium time
of the instrument.49
