With
an aim to understand the photophysical behavior of twisted
organic fluorescent molecules in their aggregated state, two twisted
biaryl molecules, namely, 9,9′-bianthryl and 10,10′-dicyano-9,9′-bianthryl,
have been synthesized and characterized by conventional spectroscopic
methods. To understand the role of C–C bond twisting on the
photophysical response of biaryl aggregates, monoaryl counterparts
(anthracene and 9-anthracenecarbonitrile) of the biaryl systems are
also investigated. Photophysical behaviors of these systems along
with their monoaryl counterpart are investigated in both solution
and aggregated state. Investigations reveal that fluorescence spectra
of the biaryl compounds show blue-shifted emission upon aggregation.
Interestingly, no blue shift of the emission has been observed for
monoaryl aggregates. Photophysical data of biaryl systems compared
to monoaryl unit reveal that change in geometry, during self-assembly
process, disfavors the formation of charge-transfer state, which eventually
causes blue shift in the emission upon aggregation. In addition to
this, potential of these systems toward signaling of nitroaromatic
explosive has also been explored. Among all of the nitroaromatics,
the highest fluorescence quenching is observed for nitrophenols (say
picric acid (PA)). The investigation also reveals that compared to
monoaryl systems, biaryl systems are more responsive to fluorescence
quenching by nitroaromatics. Perrin’s model of quenching sphere
action has been attributed to nitrophenol (PA) selective signaling
behavior of biaryl systems.

1 Introduction
In
recent times, both organic and inorganic solid-state luminescent
materials have attracted considerable attention as they have potential
to be used in display, optoelectronic devices, sensor applications,
etc.1−4 Among these, organic nanoparticles have certain advantages over
inorganic ones in terms of low cost, easy synthesis, and structural
variability.4,5 These advantages are thought to
be helpful in fabricating a number of functionalized organic nanomaterials
having desirable optical properties.3,6 Since majority
of the organic optoelectronic devices function in solid state,7−10 it is of paramount importance to understand the underlying mechanism
of photophysical responses of such systems so that a more efficient
system having suitable properties is designed and developed.

The photophysical behavior of an aggregated solid-state material
can be very different from its monomeric form in solution state. Different
structural arrangement and intermolecular interaction in solid-state
material (compared to the monomeric form) can lead to changes in the
optical behavior of these systems.9,11−13 Organic molecules usually upon aggregation exhibit red shift in
the absorption and emission spectra.14 Molecules
upon aggregation usually also cause quenching of fluorescence.15−17 Recently, Tang and co-workers18,19 have developed some
silole-based organic fluorophore molecules, which show aggregation-induced
emission property. We note that blue shift in the emission spectrum
upon aggregation is an uncommon phenomenon. Observation of blue-shifted
emission upon aggregation is very interesting and is known as aggregation-induced
blue-shifted emission (AIBSE).20−23 It has been shown by Yang and co-workers24−26 that several substituted anthracene (AN) molecules at the 9,10-positions
in solid state can also exhibit blue-shifted emission band. However,
aggregation-induced red-shifted emission is attributed to factors
such as (1) excitonic coupling, (2) increase in charge transfer (CT)
character due to geometry change, (3) J-aggregate formation, and (4)
change in the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO)–lowest
unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) gap.27a−27d The underlying mechanism for AIBSE is still hazy. Only few studies
have been carried out on this aspect. It is also noteworthy to mention
in this context that a recent study based on quantum mechanical calculation
(quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM)) has shown that lower
reorganization energy in aggregate compared to the solution can also
cause a blue-shifted emission band.28 The
above discussion tells us that studies, particularly experimental
studies, which are focused on understanding the mechanism of AIBSE
process are rather limited. Outcomes of such studies are expected
to be useful as they provide clue to tune the optical properties of
organic aggregates.

In this context, molecules having twisted
structure that possess
two anthracene rings connected through C–C bond could be an
interesting research target. Photophysical studies on these systems
in their molecular and aggregated forms are expected to provide valuable
information on structure–optical property correlation, which,
in turn, may be useful to understand photoprocesses such as AIBSE.
Note that it has been well established that twisted biaryl system
exhibits some interesting photophysical behavior.29−31 Several studies
have explored the excited-state behavior and dynamical processes of
biaryl derivatives.32 One such interesting
system is 9,9′-bianthryl (BA), as this molecule in the ground
state contains two mutually perpendicular anthracene rings connected
through C–C bond. It undergoes symmetry breaking upon excitation,
and its fluorescence spectra show a distinct charge transfer (CT)
character, especially in the polar solvents.33 Although extensive studies on molecular forms of bianthryl systems
have been done by several research groups,32,34,35 the photophysical behavior of these systems
in aggregated state has not been studied.

Since bianthryl derivatives
having conjugated electronic π-clouds
have some interesting optical properties, such as high quantum yield
(QY), good photostability, etc., they are suitable for fluorescence
signaling behavior. Moreover, organic fluorophores having extended
π-cloud are known to be quite useful for the detection of nitroaromatics
(NACs).36,37 We have also explored the BA system for
signaling of nitroaromatics. Additionally, we have also tried to understand
the mechanism of fluorescence signaling behavior of the BA system
toward nitroaromatics.

Considering the above-mentioned facts,
in the present study, we
have synthesized two twisted molecules, namely, 9,9′-bianthryl
(BA) and 10,10′-dicyano-9,9′-bianthryl (DCBA), and investigated
the photophysical behaviors of these two fluorescent molecules, in
both molecular and aggregated forms, and the obtained data are compared
to those of their monomeric unit anthracene (AN) and 9-anthracenecarbonitrile
(CA), respectively (Chart 1). Photophysical data reveal that only biaryl systems exhibit
a blue shift in the emission upon aggregation, whereas monoaryl systems
do not. The observation indicates that change in geometry of the concerned
bianthryl derivatives during the self-assembly process could be responsible
for AIBSE process.

(DCBA)
During the signaling event,
fluorescence response of biaryl systems
in the presence of nitroaromatics is observed to be different from
that observed for monoaryl systems. Both biaryl systems (BA and DCBA)
exhibit high selectivity toward nitrophenols. The “sphere of
action” quenching mechanism is found to be primarily responsible
for the nitrophenol (picric acid (PA)) signaling event. The present
study reveals that biaryl systems can effectively be used for the
detection of explosive nitroaromatics.

2 Results
and Discussion
9,9′-Bianthryl (BA), 10,10′-dicyano-9,9′-bianthryl
(DCBA), and their respective monomeric counterparts, namely, anthracene
(AN) and 9-anthracenecarbonitrile (CA), are investigated in both molecular
and aggregated forms using steady-state absorption, emission, and
time-resolved fluorescence studies.

2.1 Photophysical
Behaviors of AN, BA, CA, and
DCBA in Molecular Form
Before studying the aggregation behavior
of BA systems, we have studied the photophysical behavior of AN, BA,
CA, and DCBA in their molecular form in some selected solvents of
varying polarity. The representative absorption spectra of BA and
DCBA are shown in Figure 1. The corresponding absorption spectra of AN and CA are shown
in Figure S1 (Supporting Information).
From Figures 1 and S1, it can be observed that the vibrational structure
and peak position of the absorption band of all of the four compounds
do not change much with change in the polarity of solvent from nonpolar
cyclohexane to polar acetonitrile.32 The
similarity in the nature of the spectra of the biaryl compounds (BA
and DCBA) in the ground state to that of only anthracene moiety indicates
that the origin of absorption is mainly π–π* transition
in all cases.38 These data also show that
in the ground state, two anthracene units of biaryl systems are electronically
decoupled as they remain in mutually perpendicular orientation.32

Figure 1 Normalized absorbance spectra of (a) BA and (b) DCBA in
some selected
solvents of varying polarity.

The emission spectra for all of the present monoaryl and
biaryl
systems (AN, CA, BA, and DCBA) in some selected solvents are shown
in Figure 2. The data
corresponding to absorption and emission maxima of the compounds in
some selected solvents are listed in Table 1. Unlike absorption spectra of the above
compounds, which do not depend much on solvent polarity, the fluorescence
spectra of these compounds are observed to be highly dependent on
solvent polarity.32,34,39 It can be seen from Figure 2 that with increase in the polarity of solvents, the fluorescence
spectra become broadened and show considerable red shift of emission
band. Interestingly, one can also see from Figure 2 and Table 1 that as we move from nonpolar cyclohexane to polar
acetonitrile, the extent of red shift in the emission maxima is much
higher for biaryl systems than for their parent monomeric units. For
example, upon going from cyclohexane to acetonitrile, BA shows a 57
nm red shift in the emission, whereas AN shows only a 6 nm red shift.
Also DCBA shows a 72 nm red shift in the emission maxima as we move
from nonpolar cyclohexane to polar acetonitrile, whereas its monomeric
unit CA shows a 21 nm red shift. Schneider and Lippert40,41 previously observed the solvent-polarity-dependent emission behavior
of bianthryl systems. Both broadening and red shift of emission spectra
for bianthryl systems with increasing the polarity of solvents indicate
the formation of charge transfer (CT) state in the polar media upon
excitation. Interestingly, when we compare the fluorescence spectra
of all monoaryl and biaryl systems in a given solvent dimethyl sulfoxide
(DMSO) (Figure 3),
fluorescence spectra of biaryl systems are observed to be broadened
(structureless) and more red-shifted compared to their respective
monoaryl systems. This observation clearly suggests that in a polar
solvent, biaryl systems emit from the polar CT state.

It is pertinent to mention in this
context that the fluorescence
of BA and its derivative are strongly dependent on the polarity of
the solvent and are linked to two different excited states, namely,
a locally excited (LE) state and an intramolecular charge transfer
(CT) state.43−45 Several research groups have studied the nature of
the emitting states for BA systems. Iwakura and co-workers46 depicted that in polar solvents, the CT state
predominates, which is formed from the LE state by one-electron oxidation–reduction
of the two anthracene rings. Warman and co-workers32 demonstrated that an unstable CT state induces a rapid
flip-flop of dipole between two anthracene rings and remains in LE
state in nonpolar solvent. Some of the recent studies on bianthryl
derivatives have also revealed that the CT state originates from the
LE state and there exists an equilibrium between the exchange process
of the LE and CT states at the picosecond scale depending on the solvent
polarity.47−54 A recent study by Hashimoto et al.46 established
that polar solvent facilitates the formation of the excited CT state,
which is produced from the LE state through intramolecular charge-transfer
process. In polar solvents, due to solvent relaxation, there occurs
rearrangement of the electrons between the two anthracene rings of
BA with subsequent formation of polar charge transfer (CT) state.48 While working on BA systems, Iwata and co-workers33 showed that internal rotation that occurs through
the C–C bond of two anthracene ring plays an important role
in governing the photophysical properties of twisted BA systems.

2.2 Photophysical Behavior of AN, CA, BA, and
DCBA in Aggregated Form
UV–vis absorption and fluorescence
studies on the well-characterized aggregates of AN, BA, CA, and DCBA
have been carried out and the obtained results are compared to those
in their respective molecular form. The absorption spectra of biaryl
systems, BA and DCBA, in their molecular and aggregated forms are
provided in Figure 4. The absorption spectra for monoaryl systems, AN and CA, are also
provided in the Supporting Information (Figure S2). As can be seen from the absorption spectra, the absorption
maxima of all of the compounds in aggregated form are red-shifted
compared to those in their molecular form. Photophysical data corresponding
to the absorption behavior of monoaryl and biaryl systems in their
molecular and aggregated forms are provided in Table 2. Interestingly, we have also observed that
the shift in the absorption maximum upon aggregation is less for biaryl
systems (BA and DCBA) than for their respective monomeric counterparts
(AN and CA). For example, in the case of biaryl systems, the extents
of red shift in the absorption maximum of BA and DCBA aggregates are
8 and 18 nm, respectively, whereas monoaryl systems, AN and CA, show
19 and 38 nm red shift, respectively, in absorption maxima upon aggregation
(Table 2).

This larger red shift in the aggregated state of monoaryl
systems
(AN and CA) can be attributed to relatively more lowering of the HOMO–LUMO
energy gap in the aggregates of monoaryl systems.55,56 This is indicative of better electronic coupling between the smaller
molecules (AN and CA) in the aggregated state compared to that of
relatively larger BA and DCBA.55,56 The absorption, emission
maxima, fluorescence lifetime, and quantum yield values of the concerned
systems in both molecular and aggregated forms are provided in Table 2.

To confirm
that the shift in the absorption maxima of the concerned
systems upon aggregation (in DMSO–water mixture) is not due
to the solvent polarity-induced change of monomeric molecules, we
have recorded the absorption spectra of the compounds in methanol–water
system, whose polarity is maintained close to that of the DMSO–water
system. The shift in the absorption maxima of the molecules in methanol–water
system is found to be less (ca. 2 nm) in all cases compared to that
observed for the present aggregates (in DMSO–water system).
This observation confirms that this red shift in the absorption maxima
is due to the J-aggregation of the particles and not due to the change
in solvent polarity. As stated in Experimental Section (vide infra), the formation of aggregates is also confirmed through
dynamic light scattering (DLS) and field emission scanning electron
microscopy (FESEM) studies. Also note that the appearance of long
tail absorbance for the aggregates at the longer wavelength region
(at around 450–500 nm) indicates the Mie-scattering effect,57,58 which is also indicative of the formation of a strongly coupled
aggregated system.

The excited state of the aggregates is investigated
by exploiting
steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy. Figure 5 shows the emission
spectra of BA and DCBA aggregates along with their monomeric form.
The emission spectra for monoaryl systems (AN and CA) in their molecular
and aggregated forms are provided in the Supporting Information (Figure S3). It can be seen that like absorption,
the emission maxima of aggregates of monoaryl systems (AN, CN) are
red-shifted compared to their respective monomeric form. However,
more interestingly, for biaryl systems (BA and DCBA), upon aggregation,
a blue shift in the emission maximum of the aggregates compared to
their respective monomeric form is observed (Figure 5). This blue-shifted emission in the present
case is an interesting observation, as red shift in the emission spectra
with quenching of fluorescence intensity upon aggregation is a very
common phenomenon, but blue shift of emission due to the formation
of aggregates with quenching of fluorescence intensity is uncommon.
This process is known as the aggregation-induced blue-shifted emission
(AIBSE) phenomenon.18,20,21,59−65 Even though the observation of the AIBSE phenomenon is quite interesting,
the actual reason behind this process is still unclear. Upon a careful
look at Figure 5, one
can also see that upon aggregation, the emission spectral profiles
of the aggregates become more structured compared to their monomeric
form. The appearance of structured (less broadened) emission band
upon aggregation perhaps also arises due to the reduction in the solute–solvent
interaction as the solvent molecules will be dislodged from the surrounding
of the BA system during the self-assembly of two aromatic moieties.
To confirm the aggregation-induced quenching of fluorescence intensity
for the aggregates, we have studied the concentration-dependent fluorescence
properties of the biaryl systems (Figure 6). It has been found that on increasing the
concentration of both BA and DCBA solutions from 10–7 to 10–4 M, a sharp increase in the emission intensity
of the solutions occurs. Interestingly, upon further increase in the
concentration of the biaryl systems (5 × 10–4 and 10–3 M), the fluorescence intensity of the
solutions is observed to decrease significantly for both the systems.
This significant quenching of fluorescence of BA and DCBA systems
at higher concentration clearly proves that the aggregation-induced
quenching process is primarily responsible for the quenching of fluorescence
of the concerned systems upon aggregation. Note that similar arguments
have also been provided by Yang and co-workers66 in the case of aggregation-induced quenching study of bis[2-(9-anthracenyl)vinyl]benzene.

× 10–5 M solution in DMSO (black) and aggregated
form in DMSO–water mixture (red). The inset provides the normalized
emission spectra of BA and DCBA in its molecular and aggregated states
at λexc = 375 nm.

different concentrations at λexc = 375 nm.

The emission spectra of the two
compounds in the DMSO and DMSO/H2O mixture with increasing
water content have also been recorded.
From Figure 7, we can
say that with increasing the volume percentage of water up to 80%
in the DMSO solutions of BA and DCBA, the fluorescence intensities
of the aggregates are found to decrease about 25.8 and 24.2 times,
respectively, with a concomitant shift of the emission maxima toward
the shorter (blue) wavelength region. From this observation, it can
be clearly said that addition of a large volume of water induces aggregation.

Figure 7 Emission
spectra of (a) BA and (b) DCBA in DMSO–water mixture
with increasing water content up to 80% by volume at λexc = 375 nm.

Note that in the present
study, this blue-shifted emission occurs
only in C–C bond containing biaryl systems, not in monoaryl
systems, where C–C bond is absent. Therefore, this observation
certainly indicates that in biaryl systems, C–C bond, which
holds the two aryl ring together, plays an important role in determining
the photophysical properties of these systems in the aggregated state.
Previous studies have demonstrated that in the solid state of biaryl
systems, two anthracene moieties remain in mutually perpendicular
position.46 It has also been demonstrated
that in a polar medium, emission of BA system takes place from a twisted intramolecular charge
transfer (TICT) state, where two rings of bianthryl systems remain
in a somewhat planar (nonperpendicular) conformation and the angle
between the two rings of BA and DCBA becomes nearly 60o.46 Now, if during the aggregation process
the biaryl systems somehow attain a geometry that disfavors the formation
of TICT state through restricted rotation around central C–C
bond, then this (restricted C–C bond rotation due to geometry
change upon aggregation) could be one of the probable reasons for
which BA and DCBA upon aggregation can exhibit a blue-shifted emission.

It is pertinent to mention here that recently Shuai and co-workers28 have studied the aggregation behaviors of three
organic molecules, namely, 9,10-distyrylanthracene, 2,3-dicyano-5,6-diphenylpyrazine,
and cis,cis-1,2,3,4-tetraphenyl-1,3-butadiene through theoretical
(QM/MM) studies and made an attempt to understand the AIBSE phenomenon.
During the study, they stated that change in solvent reorganization
energy from solution to solid state and freezing of low-frequency
vibrational modes in aggregated state can cause AIBSE. However, we
would like to stress here that since no blue shift in the emission
of the aggregates of monoaryl systems AN and CA is observed in the
present study (Figure S3), we can say that
in the case of BA and DCBA aggregates, geometric restriction (due
to aggregation) plays a more important role in the AIBSE behavior
rather than in the freezing of low-frequency vibration mode. Interestingly,
when we compare the emission spectra of the bianthryl derivatives
in solution with the solid-state emission (Figure S4), it is found that the emission of BA in solid state is
blue-shifted compared to that of BA in solution phase.

Here,
we note that organic nano-/microcrystals usually formed due
to the self-assembly of individual monomeric units and the structure
property correlation of such systems can be realized by following
the gradual evolution of crystal from a nanoscopic site domain to
microcrystalline and bulk solid.67,68 Therefore,
when we look at the optical output signals of solution, colloid, and
solid forms of present biaryl and monoaryl systems, we can perhaps
say that in colloidal state, these systems attain a twisted geometry
(dihedral angle ∼ 90°), where CT transition is not favorable,
and consequently due to this reason, for BA systems, a blue-shifted
emission upon aggregation is observed. Therefore, the present study
points out that the change in geometry during the self-assembly process
can also be an important factor causing the AIBSE process.

Time-resolved
fluorescence measurement reveals that upon aggregation,
lifetime values (from Table 2) decrease for both monoaryl and biaryl systems. The representative
fluorescence intensity decay profiles of both monoaryl and biaryl
systems in molecular and aggregated states are provided in Figure S5. To throw more light on the fluorescence
quenching process of the aggregates, we have calculated the nonradiative
decay rate constants corresponding to the aggregates and their respective
monomers using the equation knr = (1 –
ϕf)/τf, where knr is the nonradiative rate constant, ϕf is the quantum yield, and τf is the fluorescence
lifetime. The nonradiative decay rate constants for BA and DCBA in
molecular form are obtained as 2.5 × 107 and 4.1 ×
107 s–1, whereas those for aggregated
state are obtained as 1.3 × 109 and 3.3 × 108 s–1, respectively. Similarly, the nonradiative
decay rate constants for AN and CA in molecular form are obtained
as 2.4 × 108 and 1.7 × 107 s–1, whereas those for aggregated state are obtained as 4.4 × 108 and 5.8 × 107 s–1, respectively.
The decrease in fluorescence lifetime in aggregated state compared
to monomeric form can be attributed to the aggregation-induced quenching
of the excited states, which, in turn, occurs because of increase
in the nonradiative decay pathways in the aggregated state.18,69

2.3 Crystallographic Analysis of BA System
To understand the aggregation behavior of biaryl systems better,
we have analyzed the packing of BA molecules in its crystal structure.
The crystal structure of BA (CCDC 123938) was reported by Bell and
Waring.81 The space group reported for
the given crystal is P21/n (monoclinic). From the packing diagram of BA molecule (Figure 8), it can be realized
that the molecules in the solid state are self-assembled primarily
through C–H···π interactions. The intermolecular
C–H···π interactions (C2–H2···π,
2.969 Å; C19–H19···π, 2.988 Å),
observed in the crystal packing of BA molecules, are shown by the
dotted red line (Figure 8). From these, it is now reasonable to assume that the colloidal
aggregates of BA molecules are also formed through the self-assembly
of BA molecules mediated by C–H···π interactions.
Similar arguments can be made for the structurally similar DCBA molecule.

X-ray analysis (crystal structure taken from ref (69), CCDC 123938). H atoms
except those involved in C–H···π interaction
are omitted for clarity.

2.4 Signaling Behavior for Nitroaromatics
We have further studied the signaling behavior of monoaryl and biaryl
systems (AN, CA, BA, and DCBA) toward nitroaromatics. The signaling
of nitroaromatics explosives has been carried out by gradually adding
some of the well-known representatives of explosive molecules such
as p-nitrotoluene (NT), 2,4-dinitrotoluene (DNT),
nitrobenzene (NB), 4-nitrophenol (NP), 2,4-dinitrophenol (DNP) and
picric acid (PA) to all monoaryl and biaryl systems independently.
We have measured the steady-state absorption spectra for the monoaryl
and biaryl systems in the presence of all of the quencher molecules
by gradually adding them into the solutions of the studied fluorophore.
Representative absorption spectra are provided in Figure 9.

Figure 9 Absorption spectra of
AN (12 μM) in the presence of 24 μM
solution of (a) DNP and (b) DNT and absorption spectra of BA (12 μM)
in the presence of 24 μM solution of (c) DNP and (d) DNT. The
inset in (c) shows the absorption of only DNP in DMSO.

It can be seen from Figure 9 that the absorbance of AN and BA increases
in the presence
of DNP and DNT. Note that the DNP alone exhibits absorption maxima
at 430 nm (inset of Figure 9c). Therefore, the increase in optical density (OD) of AN
and BA in the presence of DNP and the appearance of a new band at
around 430 nm can be thought to arise due to the presence of DNP in
the system. Similar observations have been found for other nitrophenol
derivatives (PA and NP). The present data do not clearly indicate
the ground-state complex formation. In the present case, interaction
between the fluorophore and quencher molecule is likely nonspecific
in nature.70 Cyano derivatives (CA and
DCBA) have also exhibited a similar trend of the absorption profiles
of the fluorophores in the presence of nitrophenol and nitrotoluene
derivatives. Further, fluorescence responses of monoaryl (AN and CA)
and biaryl (BA and DCBA) systems in the absence and presence of various
nitroaromatic systems have been investigated by gradually adding nitroaromatics
to the monoaryl and biaryl derivatives independently. During the titration,
fluorescence quenching of all of the monoaryl and biaryl fluorophores
has been observed. However, the extent of fluorescence quenching is
observed to be different for different quenchers. Figure 10 represents the fluorescence
quenching of biaryl systems (BA and DCBA) in the presence of different
nitroaromatics. For better comparison, the fluorescence quenching
events for BA and DCBA with various nitroaromatics are shown in a
bar diagram (Figure 11). The similar bar diagram for fluorescence quenching events of monoaryl
systems (AN and CA) in the presence of different nitroaromatics is
provided in Figure S6. From Figure 10, it can be said quite clearly
that a significant quenching for both biaryl systems (BA and DCBA)
has been observed in the presence of nitrophenol derivatives, whereas
nitrotoluenes and nitrobenzene could not appreciably quench the fluorescence
intensity of these systems. Note that greater quenching of fluorescence
for monoaryl system is also observed for nitrophenol derivatives than
for other nitroaromatics employed in this study (Figure S6).

BA and (b) DCBA in the presence of 24 μM solutions of different
nitroaromatics.

Another interesting
aspect of this signaling study is that the
extent of quenching of fluorescence intensity of monoaryl systems
by nitroaromatic derivative (say PA) is significantly less compared
to that of biaryl systems (Figures 11 and S6). Keeping the above
observation in mind, the signaling behavior of the biaryl systems
with nitrophenol derivatives is investigated further so as to understand
the signaling mechanism of this quenching event.

Representative
absorption spectra of BA and DCBA in the absence
and presence of picric acid (PA) are shown in Figure 12. From the representative steady-state absorption
spectra, it can be observed that the optical density (OD) of BA and
DCBA increases in the entire range of concentration of PA. This is
not surprising as nitrophenols such as PA and DNP themselves have
absorption in that region.71 A similar
observation in the absorption behavior of the BA and DCBA system has
been made in the presence of other nitrophenol derivatives (DNP and
NP).

molecules (a) BA and (b) DCBA in the presence of 24 μM picric
acid (PA).

The fluorescence titration
experiments have also been carried out
by taking BA and DCBA solutions independently with gradual addition
of nitrophenol derivatives (PA, DNP, and NP). Fluorescence of BA and
DCBA is found to be significantly quenched by all of the nitrophenol
derivatives. The change in fluorescence spectra of BA and DCBA with
PA is shown in Figure 13. The spectra corresponding to fluorescence titration of BA and DCBA
with other nitrophenols (DNP and NP) are provided in Figure S7 (Supporting Information). Interestingly, the quenching
of fluorescence intensity of BA and DCBA is found to be highest for
PA. This fact can be more clearly realized by looking at the bar diagram
(Figure 11), which
also indicates the highest response for PA. Note that the signaling
behavior of monoaryl systems (AN and CA) toward nitrophenols has also
been studied (Figure S8). From Figure S8, it is evident that for monoaryl derivatives,
the quenching efficiency is also highest for PA, followed by DNP.
However, as stated earlier, for a particular quencher, fluorescence
quenching is always found to be higher for biaryl systems than that
for monoaryl systems.

BA and (b)
DCBA with increasing concentration (0–24 μM) of PA.

To understand the quenching mechanism
better, the fluorescence
response of BA and DCBA in the presence of nitrophenol system has
been analyzed further in the light of the classical Stern–Volmer
(S–V) equation,70,72 which is shown below (eq 1). 1  where F0 and F denote the fluorescence
intensities before and after the
addition of quencher [Q], respectively, kq is the bimolecular quenching constant, τ0 is the
lifetime of the fluorophore in the absence of quencher, [Q] is the
quencher concentration, and KSV is the
Stern–Volmer constant. Representative S–V plots for
quenching of fluorescence intensity of BA and DCBA with nitrophenol
derivatives are given in Figures 14 and 15. The classical S–V
plots that are obtained for the fluorescence quenching event of both
BA and DCBA with DNP and NP exhibit a linear correlation of F0/F versus [Q] data for the
entire concentration range of the concerned quencher (Figure 14a,b). However, in the case
of fluorescence quenching of BA and DCBA by PA, the S–V plot
demonstrates a linear correlation of F0/F versus [Q] data up to a certain concentration
level (ca. 10 μM) (Figure 15a,b). Above this concentration limit, the F0/F versus [Q] data suddenly show an
upward deviation (Figure 15a,b). The linear S–V plots in the case of DNP and NP
indicate only one type of quenching process, i.e., either pure static
or pure dynamic quenching,67 but the nonlinear
S–V plot (upward curvature toward F0/F axis) in the case of PA indicates that the quenching
mechanism is entirely different from the other quenchers and both
static and dynamic quenching processes can be operational during the
quenching event. Note that in the absence of dynamic quenching, the
upward curvature in the classical S–V plot that has been observed
for PA system in the present study can also be explained by employing
static quenching with “sphere of action” model.70,72−74 In this context, it may be noted that the measurement
of fluorescence lifetime can often help to distinguish between static
and dynamic fluorescence quenching processes.70 In the case of pure dynamic quenching process, the fluorescence
lifetime (τ) decreases continuously with gradual addition of
quencher, which eventually gives a linear correlation of τ0/τ with quencher concentration. However, if the quenching
process is purely static, then the fluorophore lifetime practically
remains unaffected with the addition of quencher.70 To throw more light on this aspect for the present study,
fluorescence lifetimes of both BA and DCBA have been measured in the
presence and absence of variable amounts of all nitrophenol derivatives.
Representative τ0/τ versus quencher concentration
plots (presented in Figure S9) indicate
that the lifetime values of BA and DCBA remain almost unaltered with
the addition of nitrophenol derivatives, which essentially rules out
the involvement of any collisional encounter between the excited fluorophore
and the nitrophenol derivatives (i.e., dynamic quenching process)
during the signaling event. Since there is some spectral overlap between
the emission spectra of biaryl derivatives (BA and DCBA) and absorption
spectra of nitrophenols (Figure S10), there
could also be a possibility of energy transfer from BA and DCBA to
nitrophenols for which quenching can be observed. However, since no
change of lifetime values of BA and DCBA (here donor) could be observed
with successive addition of quencher concentration, the possibility
of energy transfer process in the present event is also ruled out.

Figure 15 S–V plots of F0/F vs [Q] for (a) BA fluorescence quenching by PA and (b) DCBA fluorescence
quenching by PA.

The above discussion
points out that the quenching mechanisms of
BA and DCBA by DNP and NP (where no upward curvature could be observed)
are purely static in nature. For BA derivative, the quenching constants
for DNP and NP are estimated (from the S–V plots) to be 3.75
× 105 and 1.27 × 105 M–1, respectively. Similarly for the DCBA system, the quenching constants
for DNP and NP are estimated to be 4.81 × 105 and
1.64 × 104 M–1, respectively. Since
no dynamic quenching process could be found for the quenching of BA
and DCBA by PA, the upward curvature (Figure 15a,b) corresponding to this quenching event
is analyzed further by invoking Perrin’s model of quenching
sphere of action,70,72 which is represented by eq 2 2    where Kp is the
quenching constant related to the linear portion of the S–V
plot, Vq is the volume of quenching sphere
in which quenching occurs without diffusion of the quencher molecule, RS is the radius of the quenching sphere, and NA is Avogadro’s constant. As can be seen
from Figure 15, the
data corresponding to F0/F and [Q] can now be fitted nicely by employing eq 2. This observation clearly indicates that
the quenching of BA and DCBA by picric acid (PA) follows the quenching
sphere of action model. The quenching constants (Kp) corresponding to quenching of BA and DCBA by PA are
estimated to be 1.41 × 105 and 1.26 × 105 M–1, respectively. The corresponding quenching
sphere radii (RS) for BA and DCBA are
estimated to be 29.22 and 33.73 Å, respectively. Hence, we can
say that in the case of PA, due to the formation of quenching sphere
near the vicinity of fluorophore molecule, the highest (ca. 95%) efficiency
for the quenching event is observed.

Note that the fluorescence
quenching event of monoaryl systems
(AN and CA) with nitrophenol derivatives exhibits no upward curvature
in the F0/F versus [Q]
plot for the entire concentration range of the concerned quenchers
(Figure S11). No change in the fluorescence
lifetime values of AN and CA with the addition of the quencher molecules
has been observed. The linear S–V plots in the case of PA and
DNP for monoaryl system indicate that pure static quenching process
is operating in these quenching events. The quenching constants for
AN are estimated to be 5.69 × 104 and 5.48 ×
104 M–1 for PA and DNP, respectively,
whereas quenching constants for CA are estimated to be 4.1 ×
104 and 4.31 × 104 M–1 for PA and DNP, respectively.

More interestingly, we note
here that among the nitrophenols, the
quenching efficiency follows the order PA > DNP > NP. Various
factors
such as hyperpolarizability, dipole moment, π–π
stacking, and weak interactions like intermolecular hydrogen bond
are known to play an important role during fluorescence quenching
of organic fluorophore by nitroaromatics.75−77 The observation
of the aforementioned trend is attributed mainly to the π–π
interaction between π-conjugated molecules (used in this study)
and electron-deficient nitrophenol molecules.78 It is highly likely that PA being the most electron-deficient among
the three nitrophenols (PA, DNP, and NP), the quenching efficiency
is observed to be the highest for PA with all of the studied fluorophore.
We would like to stress that recently, Patra and co-workers78 have demonstrated that intermolecular interactions
such as O–H···π between π-conjugated
molecule and nitrophenols can be responsible for nitroaromatics-induced
fluorescence quenching of organic fluorophores. Considering this fact,
in the present study, we can perhaps say that O–H···π
interaction can also play an important role for the formation of quenching
sphere around BA and DCBA molecules, which eventually facilitates
the quenching process. The higher quenching of fluorescence intensity
of DCBA by PA than that of BA is an interesting observation. Note
that phenolic hydrogen of PA is sufficiently acidic79 (pKa = −1.9 in DMSO),
and so it can additionally form intermolecular H-bond with the −CN
group of DCBA.80 This additional (O–H···CN)
interaction between nitrophenol and DCBA could be responsible for
higher quenching of DCBA by PA. The observation of larger quenching
for biaryl compared to monoaryl by nitroaromatic quenchers can be
attributed to the presence of two anthracene rings in the case of
biaryls. Fluorophore–quencher interactions are expected to
be more for biaryl systems as two anthryl rings could facilitate more
interactions (short contacts) with the studied quencher molecules.

3 Conclusions
In summary, two twisted biaryl
molecules, namely, 9,9′-bianthryl
(BA) and 10,10′-dicyano-9,9′-bianthryl (DCBA), have
been synthesized and characterized by conventional spectroscopy methods.
The photophysical properties of these systems are investigated in
both solution and aggregated state and are compared to those of their
respective monoaryl counterparts (AN and CA). A clear blue shift in
the emission is observed for twisted biaryl systems upon aggregation.
It is interesting to note here that no blue shift of emission has
been observed for the aggregates of monoaryl compounds. A careful
analysis of the photophysical data for biaryl systems reveals that
the change in geometry during the self-assembly process disfavors
the formation of CT state, which eventually causes the blue shift
in the emission upon aggregation. This effect is totally absent in
the case of monoaryl systems. Additionally, the potential of these
systems toward signaling of nitroaromatics explosive has also been
explored. The signaling event is monitored by looking at the quenching
of fluorescence intensities of different monoaryl and biaryl systems
in the presence of various nitroaromatics independently. Several interesting
aspects with regard to nitroaromatics signaling behavior by organic
fluorophores have emerged during the signaling event. Among the nitroaromatics
studied, the highest fluorescence quenching of the concerned fluorophore
is observed by picric acid (PA). The study also reveals that quenching
of fluorescence by PA is more for cyano-substituted BA derivative
(DCBA) than for BA. Perrin’s model of quenching sphere action
has been employed to explain the nitrophenol selective signaling behavior
of biaryl systems. Interactions such as π···π,
O–H···π, etc. between biaryl and nitrophenols
is thought to be responsible for the observed fluorescence quenching
of biaryl systems by nitrophenol derivatives. Due to highly acidic
nature of nitrophenols, additional (−OH···CN)
H-bonding interaction could be possible in DCBA, which, in turn, could
be responsible for facilitating the quenching process. Interestingly,
larger quenching for biaryl systems compared to monoaryl systems has
been observed. Fluorophore–quencher interaction is expected
to be more for biaryl derivatives due to the presence of two anthryl
ring in biaryl systems.

4 Experimental Section

anthrone, acetic acid, dimethylformamide (DMF), copper(I) cyanide,
granulated zinc, and chloroform were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich
and used without further purification. Concentrated hydrochloric acid
was purchased from Nice Chemicals. Magnesium(II) sulfate and iron(III)
chloride were obtained from TCI and used as received. Hexane and ethyl
acetate used for column chromatography were received from Finar and
used without further purification. Anhydrous solvents cyclohexane,
toluene, dichloromethane, tetrahydrofuran, acetonitrile, and dimethyl
sulfoxide used for photophysical studies were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich

4.2 Instrumentation
1H NMR
spectra were obtained on a Bruker BioSpin 400 MHz spectrometer at
ambient temperature using tetramethylsilane as an internal standard.
A Bruker micrOTOF-Q11 mass spectrometer was employed for the measurements
of mass spectra. UV/vis and fluorescence spectra were recorded using
a Cary 100 Bio UV/vis spectrophotometer and a Cary Eclipse fluorescence
spectrophotometer, respectively. Time-resolved fluorescence measurements
were carried out by using a time-correlated single-photon counting
spectrometer (Edinburgh, OB920). A light-emitting diode laser, EPL
375 nm, was used to excite the molecule, and an MCP photomultiplier
(Hamamatsu R3809U-50) was used as the detector (response time, 40
ps). The lamp profile was recorded by using a scatterer (dilute ludox
solution in water) in place of the sample. Decay curves were analyzed
by a nonlinear least-squares iteration procedure using the F900 decay
analysis software. The quality of the fit was judged by the chi-squared
(χ2) values and visual inspection of weighted deviations
of residuals. In particular, a field emission scanning electron microscope
from ZEISS was used to capture the images of organic aggregates. The
aggregate sizes were determined through the dynamic light scattering
(DLS) method using Malvern Zetasizer instrument.

4.3 Synthesis and Characterization
4.3.1 Synthesis
of 9,9′-Bianthryl (BA)
9,9′-Bianthryl was synthesized
using a method reported in
the literature.81 Typically 20 g of anthrone,
20 g of granulated zinc, and 100 cc of acetic acid were loaded in
a two-neck RB flask and then heated under reflux for 8–9 h
with dropwise addition of fuming HCl for the first 5 h only. Pale
yellow crystals of 9,9′-bianthryl started to precipitate after
a few hours. Then, the obtained compound was filtered and purified
using column chromatography on silica using hexane and ethyl acetate
(3:1) as the eluent. The yield of the obtained product was 75%. The
compound was characterized using NMR and mass spectroscopy. 1H NMR: (400 MHz, CDCl3): δ 7.03 (d, 4H), 7.13 (d,
4H), 7.45 (d, 4H), 8.16 (d, 4H), 8.71 (s, 2H). Electrospray ionization
mass spectrometry (ESI-MS): 354.41 (M+).

4.3.2 Synthesis of 10,10′-Dicyano-9,9′-bianthryl
(DCBA)
10,10′-Dicyano-9,9′-bianthryl (DCBA)
was synthesized using a method published by Mueller and Baumgarten.82 It was synthesized by taking a suspension of
2 g of 10,10′-dibromo-9,9′-bianthryl and 1 g of CuCN
in freshly distilled DMF and then refluxed for 3–4 h under
an inert atmosphere. After that, the reaction mixture was cooled down
and poured into a 1 M FeCl3 solution, which was then repeatedly
extracted with CHCl3, and MgSO4 was used for
drying. After that, the solution was concentrated and then the residue
was chromatographed over silica gel with hexane and ethyl acetate
(3:1) as eluent. The obtained product (yield 78%) was characterized
using 1H NMR and mass spectroscopy. 1H NMR:
(400 MHz, CDCl3): δ 8.64 (dd, 4H), 7.74 (m, 4H),
7.31 (m, 4H), 7.09 (dd, 4H). ESI-MS: 404.43 (M+).

4.4 Fabrication of Organic Aggregates
The aggregates
of AN, BA, CA, and DCBA were prepared using a well-known
reprecipitation method.83,84 In short, 30 μL
of a solution of each compound in DMSO (0.01 M) was rapidly injected
through a syringe into 3 mL of Milli-Q water separately under vigorous
stirring. The stirring was continued for about 20 min. The clear solution
turns hazy, indicating the formation of aggregates. The formation
of aggregates was confirmed by UV–vis absorption spectroscopy,
FESEM images, and DLS method. To prepare the samples for FESEM study,
freshly prepared diluted solutions of the aggregates were drop-cast
on a clean silicon wafer surface and kept under vacuum for drying.

4.5 Determination of Fluorescence Quantum Yield
Quantum yields (QYs) of AN, BA, CA, and DCBA in molecular and aggregated
forms were measured following the standard procedure with quinine
sulfate in 0.1 M H2SO4 (QY 0.54) as the reference
compound.85 During QY measurement, the
absorbances of both quinine sulfate dissolved in 0.1 M H2SO4 and the solutions of AN, BA, CA, and DCBA in DMSO
were kept below 0.1 at the excitation wavelength of 350 nm. Optically
matched solutions of reference and sample were used for measurement.
Quantum yield was measured using the following equation (eq 3) 3  where QY is the quantum yield, I is the fluorescence intensity, A is the absorbance,
and n is the refractive index of the medium. The
subscripts “sam” and “ref“ represent sample
studied and the reference used, respectively.

4.6 Characterization
of Aggregates
The
prepared aggregates were characterized using UV–vis spectroscopy,
FESEM, and dynamic light scattering (DLS) techniques. During UV–vis
spectroscopy, a red shift in the absorption spectra of the colloidal
solution was observed. This observation is indicative of aggregate
formation. Figure 16 shows the FESEM images of AN, BA, CA, and DCBA aggregates. The formation
of aggregate and their size calculation were also investigated by
dynamic light scattering (DLS) measurements (Figure 17).

Figure 16 FESEM images of (a) AN, (b) BA, (c) CA, and
(d) DCBA aggregates
at room temperature.

Figure 17 DLS plots of AN, CA, BA, and DCBA aggregates at room temperature.

The sizes calculated from DLS
measurements are given in Table 3. It is observed that
with increasing the size of the molecules, the hydrodynamic radius
decreases, which is consistent with the literature reported data on
some organic aggregated systems.86 The
relatively larger size of smaller AN and CA molecules compared to
larger molecules BA and DCBA is probably due to better packing of
the AN and CA molecules in the aggregated state.
