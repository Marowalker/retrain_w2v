Withania coagulans is an Indian
medicinal herb, the natural extracts of which are purported to have
health-benefiting properties. In this study, the extract was encapsulated
in nature-derived polymers with the aim of enhancing its bioavailability.
The aqueous extract obtained from the plant W. coagulans was found to elicit the glucose-lowering effect by means of promoting
insulin secretion from pancreatic β cells. The cells treated
with the extract showed a nearly 2-fold increase in insulin secretion
compared to untreated cells. A delivery system for the extract was
developed based on electrosprayed chitosan nanoparticles coated with
food-based starch. The enteric starch coating retarded (by 2.5 times)
the release of the extract in the stomach. The bioactivity of the
encapsulated extract was subsequently tested in vitro on mouse-derived
pancreatic β cells, whereby the delivery system was found to
promote insulin secretion. Finally, the extract-encapsulated oral
delivery system was tested on diabetic mice and was validated to decrease
blood glucose levels by 60%. In summary, it could be inferred that
food-grade enteric-coated polysaccharide-based particles increase
the bioavailability of the extracted compounds from the plant W. coagulans.

1 Introduction
There
is an ever-increasing interest in complementary and alternative
medicine to combat chronic illnesses. The impetus to exploit such
alternative therapies lies in the intent to identify new molecules
that may potentially be more efficient than existing drugs, with possibilities
of reduced side effects.1 Moreover, the
advantage of using the traditional system of medicine lies in the
fact that many of these naturally obtained extracts offer an early
intervention and health maintenance approach in alleviating diseases.2 Such naturally obtained extracts could also serve
as leads to the chemical synthesis of new drugs.3 While there are numerous natural, plant-based compounds
used in traditional medicines, extracted nutrients from the food that
possess therapeutic properties are classified as nutraceuticals.4 Owing to their food-based origin, they are generally
considered less toxic and are thus more widely accepted, although
dosage-related toxicity or toxicity due to cross-reactivity with synthetic
drugs cannot be ruled out.5 In fact, with
the increasing focus on health and well-being globally, the demand
for nutraceuticals, especially from developing economies, i.e., Brazil,
China, India, etc., is on the rise, whereby recent estimates reflect
that the global nutraceutical market will reach USD 578.23 billion
by 2025.6 In view of this growing interest
in nutraceuticals, rigorous and systematic scientific-based investigations
are imperative to understand their therapeutic effects, toxic doses,
and mechanisms of action.

Diabetes, a chronic metabolic disorder,
is manifested mainly as
high-blood-glucose levels, which when left untreated leads to complications
in other organs such as kidney, heart, eyes, and the nervous system.7 Lately, diabetes has become a global epidemic,
affecting people in both poor and affluent countries. Type 2 diabetes,
predisposed by obesity and physical inactivity, is the most prevalent
type of diabetes.8 According to a recent
2017 report, about 451 million people are affected by diabetes. Of
the total, type I diabetes accounts for only a small percentage of
the total estimates. Global estimates for type 1 diabetes in children
and adolescents aged less than 20 years was 1 106 200
in 2017. While patients with type I diabetes need daily insulin injections
to survive, for type II diabetes, the first line of treatment is mainly
lifestyle changes, followed by single or combination therapies with
oral hyperglycemic drugs. When oral medications fail to control blood
glucose levels, insulin injections are prescribed.9 In addition to the health setback experienced by the patient,
diabetes also poses a considerable financial burden, with the requirement
for life-long medication. The mean cost for the management of the
disease can range from 1000 to 4000 international dollars per person,
depending on the economic region.9,10 This is reflected
from the projected treatment market size of USD 64 billion by 2026.11

In the recent decade, there have been
reports on plant extracts
exhibiting antidiabetic properties.12,13Withania coagulans (common name: Paneer dodi) is
one such plant, whose extracts have traditionally been used in the
coagulation of milk to make Indian cheese14 and have also been used in the traditional Indian system of medicine
due to its numerous therapeutic properties.15−17 The use of
such extracts in the management of diabetes may be preferred over
existing drugs, especially if proven to be more efficacious and safer.
While the consumption of the raw extract is traditionally practiced
by immersing the fruit overnight in water, its bitter taste and strong
odor deter consumption of the necessary quantities of it to elicit
a health-benefiting effect. To overcome this, such naturally derived
extracts can be encapsulated into concentrated forms to function as
nutraceuticals. The validation of these extracts against diabetes
therefore warrants a rigorous and thorough investigation through scientific
approaches. Another distinct challenge in the consumption of the extracts
is that, since the extracts are consumed orally, they have to encounter
the low-pH conditions in the stomach and various enzymes throughout
the gastrointestinal tract (GIT). Plant-based extracts are usually
sensitive to such adverse conditions, which may render them inactive,
thus reducing their bioavailability.18,19

Based
on the above discourse, it was hypothesized that the encapsulation
of the extract of W. coagulans into
food-based particles, with specific small-intestine-targeting functionality,
would provide sustained glucose-lowering capabilities. To test this
hypothesis, the active compound was solvent-extracted and encapsulated
into a delivery system that could retain its bioactivity until it
reaches the intended site of adsorption along the GIT. Subsequently,
its efficacy was evaluated through in vitro and in vivo studies. This
study is a primary initiative to encapsulate extracts from W. coagulans and to evaluate their efficacy on diabetic
mice.

2 Experimental Section
2.1 Materials
Low-molecular-weight chitosan
(≥75% deacetylated, viscosity 20–300 cps, and molecular
weight 50–190 kDa), sodium tripolyphosphate (TPP), sodium trimetaphosphate
(STMP), starch, pepsin, and pancreatin were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich,
Singapore. Dulbecco’s minimum essential medium (DMEM)/high
glucose with l-glutamine and sodium pyruvate (DMEM–GE
Hyclone) used for MIN6 culture was obtained from GE Healthcare Pte.
Ltd. Fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Gibco), 1% penicillin streptomycin
solution (Gibco), and 0.25% trypsin-ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid
(Gibco) were procured from Life Technologies Holdings Pte. Ltd. The
cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) was purchased from Dojindo Molecular Technologies,
Inc. The mouse insulin ELISA assay kit was purchased from Mercodia.
Blood glucose levels in mice were determined using Terumo Blood Glucose
Test Strips with Terumo, Medisafe Ex Blood Glucose Meter (Terumo Corp.,
Tokyo, Japan). W. coagulans was sourced
from a herb supplier (Haridass Aggarwal & Sons, Mumbai, India).

2.2 Methods
2.2.1 Extraction of Coagulans
Withanolides
were extracted from the plant W. coagulans sourced from a herb supplier in India. The extraction process was
performed according to a previously reported procedure with slight
modifications.20 The berries of known weight
from the plant were crushed mechanically using a pestle and mortar,
and the coarse powder obtained was soaked in a 1:1 mixture of water
and ethanol for 24 h. The extract was collected by filtering out the
coarse powder using a Whatman filter paper. The hydroalcoholic extract
was concentrated using a rotary evaporator for 1 h. An aliquot of
the concentrated extract was mixed with a 1:1 mixture of water and
ethyl acetate and extracted to obtain a water-soluble fraction and
an ethyl acetate-soluble fraction. The water-soluble fraction was
concentrated using a rotary evaporator and subjected to column chromatography
over silica gel (230–400 mesh size) using a mixture of water
and methanol (1:1) as the mobile phase. A glass Pasteur pipette filled
up to 2.5 in. high with silica gel was first eluted with the mobile
phase to wet the silica. The concentrated water-soluble fraction (5
mL) was added to the column and eluted using 10 mL of the mobile phase.
This eluent was then subjected to rotary evaporation to remove the
methanol and freeze-dried to obtain a dry powder. This freeze-dried
fraction, referred to as P4 hereafter, was evaluated for its glucose-lowering
effect.

2.2.2 Characterization of P4
P4 was characterized
using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) to confirm the
presence of compounds with the steroidal lactone backbone. The dry
powder of P4 was mixed with potassium bromide (KBr) in the ratio of
1:100 and pelletized using a hydraulic press and analyzed using a
PerkinElmer Frontier FTIR spectrophotometer. The raw data was plotted
on Origin to obtain the peaks. P4 was also characterized using nuclear
magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. For this, P4 was dissolved
in deuterated water (D2O) and NMR spectra were recorded
on a Bruker AV 400 MHz spectrometer, with tetramethylsilane as the
internal reference. For molecular weight evaluation using matrix-assisted
laser desorption ionization–time-of-flight (MALDI–TOF)
mass spectrometry, P4 dissolved in water was crystallized along with
the matrix and sinapic acid and analyzed using a Shimadzu Axima performance
MALDI–TOF mass spectrometer.

2.2.3 In
Vitro Studies
Mouse pancreatic
β cells, MIN6 (CRL-11506), were used as the β cell model
to study insulin secretion. The cells were cultured in DMEM, supplemented
with 10% FBS, 100 U mL–1 penicillin, 100 μg
mL–1 streptomycin, and 0.001% β-mercaptoethanol.
Cells were passaged once they reached 80% confluency. All experiments
were done using cells with passage numbers 40–47. For toxicity
studies, the cells were seeded on 96-well plates at a density of 2
× 104 cells per well. Cells reached
confluency after 24 h; different concentrations of P4 (1, 2, 5, 10,
and 25 μM) were added to the cells, and cell viability was evaluated
after 2 h using the CCK-8 assay kit. For the insulin release study,
cells were seeded on 6-well plates at the density of 1 × 105 cells per well and studied using the glucose-stimulated
insulin secretion assay (GSIS).21,22 Briefly, once the cells
reach confluency after 48 h, DMEM was removed and the cells were washed
and starved for 2 h by incubating in Ca-10 buffer with 0.5 mM glucose.
This initial 2 h incubation is the standard for depriving the cells
of glucose to limit the insulin secretion. After 2 h starvation, the
buffer was removed and the cells were incubated for another 30 min
in Ca-10 buffer with 0.5 mM glucose. The samples were collected and
were used to measure for the baseline insulin at nonstimulated condition
by ELISA. After this 30 min starvation, the cells were stimulated
by treating with Ca-10 buffer containing 16 mM glucose and the P4
treatments were done. P4 was dissolved in water at a concentration
of 1 mM and was diluted accordingly to reach 1, 2, 5, 10, and 25 μM
with Ca-10 buffer containing 16 mM glucose before adding 200 μL
to each of the wells. After a treatment time of 30 min, the samples
from the wells were collected to be analyzed by ELISA for insulin
secretion under the glucose-stimulated condition in the presence or
absence of P4. The insulin index was calculated using the equation
below. Ca-10 buffer was prepared as follows: 125 mM NaCl, 5.9 mM KCl,
1.28 mM CaCl2, 1.2 mM MgCl2, 25 mM HEPES, and
0.2% BSA with a desired concentration of glucose added for the low-
and high-glucose conditions. 1  

2.2.4 Fabrication and Encapsulation of P4 in the
Carrier
The fabrication and characterization of chitosan
nanoparticles (chnp) and chnp coated with starch (C+S) were conducted
similar to what had previously been reported by the authors.23 Briefly, chnp were fabricated using electrospraying
with the optimized parameters as follows: the concentration of chitosan
dissolved in 50% acetic acid, 0.1% W/V; the concentration of TPP dissolved
in water, 1% W/V with 0.5% (V/V) Tween 80; voltage, 25 kV; flow rate,
0.2 mL h–1; and working distance, 7 cm. The particles
were electrosprayed directly into the cross-linking TPP solution and
collected by centrifugation at an RCF of 13 000g. For coating with starch, the nanoparticle suspension was added
to gelatinized soluble starch, 1:1 ratio of chnp and starch (Sigma
S7965, 5 mg mL–1, gelatinized by heating starch
granules in water to 90 °C), and stirred for 1 h for electrostatic
interactions between starch and chnp. Starch was then cross-linked
using 1% (W/V) STMP dissolved in water. For encapsulation of P4, it
was mixed directly into the chitosan solution and electrospraying
was carried out as detailed above. The encapsulation efficiency (EE)
of P4 was calculated using the equation below. 2  

2.2.5 In
Vitro Release Studies
Release
studies of P4 were carried out sequentially in simulated gastric fluid
(SGF) (pH 1.2), simulated intestinal fluid (SIF) (pH 6.8), and pH
4.4 medium to mimic the path of the particles in the GIT.23 Release studies were performed by suspending
the particles in the release media at 37 °C in an incubator fitted
with a rotating wheel at a speed of 20 rpm over a period of 48 h.
The time frame in each simulated fluid was chosen to mimic the residence
times of food in each region of the GIT: stomach (2 h), small intestine
(3 h), and pH 4.4 buffer (PBS adjusted to pH 4.4) (43 h). At fixed
time points, the medium was removed by centrifugation and replaced
with fresh medium. The release of P4 was quantified using high-performance
liquid chromatography (HPLC) (Shimadzu Prominence UFLC) with a photodiode
array detector SPD-M20A, Ascentis C18 column (10 cm, 2.1 cm I.D.,
and 5 μm) with methanol–water (1:1) as the mobile phase
at a flow rate of 0.2 mL min–1, maintained at 30
°C. The dominant peak for P4 was observed at a retention time
of 11.1 min. Suitable standards of P4 were prepared in methanol–water
(1:1) to obtain a calibration curve.

2.2.6 Bioactivity
Testing of P4 Encapsulated in
Particles
To investigate the bioactivity of P4 encapsulated
in particles, both starch-coated and uncoated chnp, encapsulated with
P4, were subjected to sequential GIT conditions: SGF, SIF, and pH
4.4 medium. The concentration of P4 in the collected release media
at each time point was kept at 1 μM after dilution with Ca-10
buffer containing 16 mM glucose. This diluted release medium containing
P4 was added to MIN6 cells (200 μL well–1),
and GSIS assay was carried out as mentioned in Section 2.2.3.

2.2.7 In Vivo Studies
The ability of
the aqueous extract P4 in lowering blood glucose was further evaluated
in mice using an alloxan-induced diabetes model. Male ICR mice, aged
5 weeks, weighing 28–30 g, were obtained from Nomura Siam International,
Thailand. On arrival, the animals were housed in stainless steel cages
(2 mice per cage) at the Laboratory Animal Facility, Suranaree University
of Technology. After acclimatization for a week, the mice were induced
with diabetes by peritoneal injection of alloxan (120 mg kg–1), based on the protocol adapted from Alam et al.24 Food [Smartheart Hamster Food, Perfect Companion (Taiwan)
Co., Ltd] and water were given ad libitum. Fasting blood glucose (FBG)
levels were monitored after 3 days of alloxan injection. Diabetic
animals with FBG levels ≥250 mg dL–1 were
used for the study. To keep the initial FBG levels same across the
groups, the animals were grouped such that the average of the FBG
in each group was not statistically different across the groups. For
the initial study, the animals were divided into two treatment groups,
with N = 3, and were treated with P4 (50 mg kg–1)20 or deionized (DI) water
(negative control) for 5 days. P4 was dissolved in water and was fed
by oral gavage every day for the entire experiment period. The body
weight and FBG was monitored on day 0 at the start of the experiment
and at day 5 at the end of the experiment. A set of control animals
that were not induced with diabetes also received similar treatments
over 15 days to assess for any toxicity of the fraction.

The
effect of the extract-loaded delivery system was studied using the
P4-encapsulated chnp and C+S particles. The particles were prepared
as outlined in Section 2.2.4, and based on the EE, the amount of particles was matched
to 50 mg kg–1 of P4 before feeding to the animals.
Each animal was fed 8.25 mg of chnp and 16.5 mg of C+S every day (the
weight of C+S is double due to the starch coating; similar amounts
of chnp was used in both cases: 1 mg of chnp contains 0.2 mg of P4).
The particles were suspended in DI water and fed to the animals by
oral gavage. Four test groups of diabetic animals, with N = 3, were fed P4-encapsulated chnp, P4-encapsulated C+S, or DI water
(negative control) for 5 days. After 5 days, the treatment was stopped
and the FBG level was monitored for another 5 days. The fourth test
group was treated with glibenclamide (antidiabetic drug as a positive
control at 20 mg kg–1) for 10 days continuously.
Data is represented as the percentage change in FBG, calculated on
the basis of the equation below. All procedures were approved and
conducted following the guidelines of the Institutional Animal Care
and Use Committee, Suranaree University of Technology [Accreditation
number: B 2559/00020.001 (SUT Laboratory Animal Facility), Permission
number: U1-01433-2558 (Investigator)].  

3 Results
3.1 Characterization of P4
P4 obtained
from W. coagulans was characterized
using FTIR, NMR, and MALDI–TOF spectroscopies. For compounds
previously extracted from the Withania species plants, a steroidal
lactone backbone has been commonly reported. From the FTIR spectra
of P4, represented in Figure 1a, the presence of the characteristic cyclic ether of the
α–β unsaturated ketone peak at 1080 cm–1 and the peak for δ lactone at 1660 cm–1 confirmed
the steroidal lactone backbone. Other notable peaks confirming this
structure were observed at 3380 cm–1 attributed
to the −OH stretch and at 1600 and 2940 cm–1 that correspond to the aromatic ring stretch. The presence of these
characteristic peaks provides a preliminary quantitative confirmation
of the molecules present in the fractions.25

Further confirmation of the similarity of P4 to that of the
reported
analytes25 was done using 1H
NMR spectroscopy. Based on the NMR peaks obtained (Figure 1b), the peaks at 1.87 and 2.15
ppm can again be attributed to the steroidal lactone ring of P4. The
α- and β-olefinic hydrogens of the conjugated enone were
clearly evident at 5.39 and 6.45 ppm, respectively (see the inset).
The C-18, C-19, and C-21 methyl groups were also prominently evident
at 1.09, 1.12, and 1.14 ppm, respectively, as indicated in Figure 1b.

Mass spectrometric
analysis was performed using MALDI–TOF–MS,
as a qualitative analysis, to identify the molecular weight of the
dominant compound. Three dominant peaks were observed at 491.06 m/z, 530.53 m/z, and 560.99 m/z. This
led to the conclusion that there is more than one compound present
in the fraction and that the higher-molecular-weight compounds in
P4 might be due to a glycoside attached to the steroidal lactone rings,
as commonly observed for some of the withanolides such as coagulin
L, as identified in the extracts of W. coagulans.(28)

3.2 Effect
of P4 on Insulin-Secreting MIN6 Cells
and Diabetic Mice
P4 was evaluated to assess its glucose-lowering
effect in vitro. Cytotoxicity studies of P4 on MIN6 cells revealed
that P4 was relatively benign to the cells up to 1 μM concentration
(Figure S1). At concentrations of 2 and
5 μM, approximately 70% of the cells survived, which was a significant
reduction in cell viability in comparison to that at lower concentrations
(p < 0.05). Using the same five concentrations
(0.1, 0.5, 1, 2, and 5 μM), the insulin secretion ability of
MIN6 cells was evaluated using the GSIS assay. Here, the amount of
insulin released is represented as a fold change, whereby the fold
change for the cells treated with P4 was compared to that of the untreated
cells. In Figure 2,
four of the five concentrations chosen showed better insulin fold
change than the untreated. A concentration-dependent increase in insulin
secretion was observed up to 1 μM, beyond which the insulin
secretion began to decline. At 1 μM P4, MIN6 cells showed a
significant surge in insulin secretion (p < 0.05).
Based on the cytotoxicity studies (Figure S1), given that cell viability reduced to ∼70% at 2 and 5 μM,
it is unsurprising that the insulin fold change decreased correspondingly.
Since insulin secretion from β cells is a tightly regulated
pathway,29 cell survivability might have
an impact on one or more processes regulating the insulin-secreting
activity. Hence, this further emphasizes the importance of encapsulating
this compound into delivery systems that would provide controlled
release at regulated concentrations. Based on the results, the concentration
of 1 μM was chosen for subsequent in vitro bioactivity tests
using P4-encapsulated chnp and C+S. The effect of P4 on pancreatic
β cells has not been reported despite traditional beliefs on
the antidiabetic effect of the plant. Such investigations would help
assess the mechanism by which the plant extracts lower blood glucose.

Figure 2 Insulin
fold change observed for the mouse pancreatic β cells
(MIN6) on treatment with different concentrations of P4. *p < 0.05 (one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and post-hoc
Tukey test, n = 3). Data are expressed as mean and
standard deviation.

The aqueous fraction,
P4, was further evaluated in vivo to validate
its effectiveness in reducing blood glucose levels in a diabetic mouse
model induced with alloxan. In a preliminary experiment to evaluate
the toxicity of P4, the animals in the nondiabetic control group were
fed DI water or P4 at 50 mg kg–1 for 15 days and
their body weight and FBG levels were monitored over this time period
(Figure S2). There was no significant difference
observed in the body weight and blood glucose levels in the animals
that were fed either DI water or P4. This suggested that P4 did not
elicit any harmful or toxic responses in the animals, confirming its
safety up to the tested concentration.

3.3 Encapsulation
and Release Kinetics of P4 from
chnp and Starch-Coated chnp (C+S)
P4 was encapsulated
into a food-grade carrier system (EE of 39 ± 8%), and its release
kinetics from chnp and C+S particles was studied in vitro by mimicking
the different environments the particles would encounter in the GIT,
i.e., a GI simulator. As observed in Figure 3, the uncoated chnp (control) released 38%
of P4 in SGF within 2 h, whereas the C+S particles released 16% of
P4 (∼2.5 times reduction), which was significantly different
from the control (p < 0.05). This indicates that
the starch layer was able to retard the release of P4 in SGF, mimicking
the low-pH condition in the stomach. When transferred to SIF, the
swollen, control (uncoated chnp) continued to release P4, achieving
a cumulative release of 56% at 5 h. For the C+S particles, while the
starch coating was digested in SIF, there were no enzymes or conducive
acidic pH environment to trigger the release of P4 from chnp; hence,
only 14% was released in SIF. To mimic cellular uptake, the particles
were next transferred to the pH 4.4 medium. Here, the slightly acidic
pH promotes the swelling of chnp and a rapid release of P4, as observed
within the first few hours. It is shown that the uncoated chnp released
less than 7% of P4 in the first 2 h, whereas more than 20% of release
was observed from C+S particles during the same period. This can be
attributed to the burst release due to the swelling of chitosan, from
the now uncoated C+S particles, under an acidic pH environment. Subsequently,
P4 continued to release progressively from the C+S particles, with
a total of 60% during this period. This demonstrates the protection
starch rendered to the C+S particles, as ∼80% of the encapsulated
P4 remained even after being exposed to SGF. It was hypothesized that
a delayed release of P4 in the SGF as such would increase the bioavailability
of P4, which will potentially enhance its glucose-lowering effects.

and pH 4.4 medium. *Significantly different (p <
0.05) from C+S at the corresponding time point, one-way ANOVA, post-hoc,

as mean and standard deviation.

3.4 Bioactivity Testing of P4 Encapsulated in
Particles on MIN6 Cells
With the knowledge that the starch
coating is able to retard the release of P4 in SGF and might facilitate
the release within the enterocytes itself, it is still imperative
to ensure and prove that P4 remains bioactive to elicit its health-benefiting
effects. For this purpose, the GSIS assay was carried out by measuring
insulin secretion of MIN6 cells exposed to the release media collected
from the particles subjected to a sequence of SGF, SIF, and pH 4.4
medium.

From the results shown in Figure 4, it is evident that the blank release medium
itself does not have any effect on the insulin secretion from MIN6
cells, achieving the same insulin levels as the basal insulin secretion.
The fold change in insulin secretion observed on treatment with 1
μM P4 was 2.7, and this was kept as the upper limit. For free
P4 (without encapsulation), there was no increase in insulin secretion
when added to SIF, whereas P4 in pH 4.4 media promotes insulin secretion.
There are two possibilities for this observation: (1) the enzymes
in SIF alter P4, causing it to lose its bioactivity and (2) since
P4 is free, there is a partial loss of bioactivity at pH 4.4. The
former is again verified as a similar trend of bioactivity loss in
SIF was observed for the P4 released in SIF from C+S particles. P4
that was released in pH 4.4 from C+S had its bioactivity completely
preserved because of the encapsulation within C+S particles. This
proves that P4 retains its bioactivity when encapsulated in C+S particles,
even after passing through the GIT.

Figure 4 Insulin fold change observed in MIN6 cells
on treatment with free
P4 and P4 encapsulated in C+S after sequential release in SGF, SIF,
and pH 4.4 medium. The blank release medium was used as a negative
control. Data are expressed as mean and standard deviation.

3.5 Blood-Glucose-Lowering
Effect of P4-Loaded
Particles on Diabetic Mice
We further validated the above
in vitro observation with in vivo study using diabetic mice. Diabetic
mice were fed by oral gavage the formulations and control for 5 days
and monitored for another 5 days for their FBG. Glibenclamide treatment
for the positive control group had to be carried on continuously for
the entire 10 days of the study period, as there was a high risk of
mortality due to severe diabetes in the absence of treatment. In Figure 5, after 5 days of
treatment with C+S and chnp particles, it was observed that the animals
that received the chnp treatment did not show any difference in the
FBG levels, consistent with the fact that chnp releases P4 preemptively
in the stomach, where its effect cannot be manifested. Hence, this
group was ruled out for the subsequent day 10 study. On the other
hand, P4 encapsulated within C+S was able to significantly lower the
FBG values compared to the untreated animals (p <
0.05). Interestingly, even after stopping the treatment for 5 days,
the animals in the C+S treatment group continued to show a decrease
in FBG values. This was significantly different (p < 0.05) compared to those in the positive control group (glibenclamide
treated) and negative control (DI water treated) group, suggesting
the ability of the delivery system to prolong the release of P4 over
an extended period of time. In addition, the result also proves that
the C+S delivery system not only retards the premature release of
the drug but also enables P4 to be absorbed systemically to exert
an effect.

4 Discussion
In an effort to combine the alternative system of medicine using
plant extracts with that of the burgeoning field of encapsulation
technology, the aqueous extract (P4) from the berries of W. coagulans has been encapsulated into a food-based
polymeric carrier, with two converging aims: one is to provide a suitable
delivery system for P4 whereby no such nanocarrier system currently
exists and the other is to prove the small-intestine-targeting ability
of the developed food-grade carrier in vivo.

There is a lack
of information when it comes to the testing of
the extracts from W. coagulans in vitro,
which could largely help in the understanding of their mechanism of
action. Since most of the plant extracts that exert an antidiabetic
effect act by promoting insulin secretion from β cells, it was
first hypothesized that W. coagulans promotes insulin secretion by sensitizing or stimulating the β
cells through activation of Ca2+ channels and, in turn,
exocytosis of insulin from insulin-containing granules.30 This ability of P4 to promote insulin secretion
at a certain concentration was confirmed in vitro using pancreatic
β cells (MIN6) (Figure 2). Different organic compounds such as saponins, flavonoids,
tannins, alkaloids, terpenoids, and sterols have been previously shown
to be present in the extracts of W. coagulans.(31) Such bioactive components have been
associated with hypoglycemic activity.32 Based on the characterization of P4, since the structural backbone
is similar to that of a sterol, it is hypothesized that the presence
of a sterol could be responsible for the glucose-lowering effect observed
for P4.

P4 was encapsulated into a chitosan particle delivery
system using
electrospraying. This fabrication methodology does not use any toxic
solvents that could degrade the plant extracts. The successful encapsulation
of P4 within the delivery system demonstrates the feasibility of loading
the compounds extracted from W. coagulans into a carrier, which has not been previously reported. The results
shown for the encapsulation of P4 open the possibility of using different
materials to encapsulate the extract, depending on the desired applications.
The targeted delivery of P4 to the small intestine to achieve enhanced
absorption was tested in vitro using different simulated GIT fluids.
The starch coating on chnp for C+S particles was able to retard the
burst release of P4 in SGF. The chnp were designed in a way to be
taken up by the enterocytes lining the small intestine to increase
the bioavailability of the encapsulated compound. Having previously
shown the uptake of chnp by Caco2 cells,23 the release kinetics study evaluated the ability of the particles
to release P4 inside the lysosome of the cells during the cell uptake.
This was simulated using the pH 4.4 medium to mimic the condition
inside the lysosome. It is worth noting that toxicity studies are
needed to assess the potential toxicity of the proposed particle delivery
system. Such studies need to include the interactions with food and
potential physicochemical transformations across the GIT in tandem
with a robust cell culture model to mimic the intestinal epithelium.33−36

The main aim of encapsulating P4 was to protect it from degradation
during transit through the GIT and preserve its activity until it
reaches the site of action. Although the release kinetics studies
indicated that the delivery system was able to perform this role,
the preservation of the activity of P4 was tested by assessing the
insulin secretion ability using the GSIS assay on MIN6 cells. As observed
in Figure 4, an interesting
finding of this study was that not only the low pH of SGF but also
the enzymes in SIF could also destroy the bioactivity of such labile
compounds. The results from this study further strengthened the claim
that encapsulating P4 protects its activity and the delivery system
served to overcome this undesired loss of activity.

To prove
the targeting and uptake ability of the carrier in animal
models, in vivo studies were carried out. This was investigated by
comparing the effect of uncoated chnp encapsulated with P4 and starch-coated
chnp encapsulated with P4 on diabetic mice. Uncoated chnp were unable
to lower the FBG, as P4 needs to be released and absorbed in the small
intestine to lower blood glucose. C+S particles, on the other hand,
were able to lower FBG, indicating the targeting ability of the coated
starch layer and the ability of chnp, thus released, to have been
taken up by the enterocytes, which could have led to the systemic
response of lowering blood glucose.

As an extension of the above
study, the ability of the C+S particles
to produce a sustained effect in the absence of treatment was also
investigated. An important observation in Figure 5 is the increase in FBG after day 5, indicated
as a decrease in the percentage change of FBG for the glibenclamide-treated
group. Glibenclamide is a drug that induces insulin secretion from
β cells, and the alloxan-induced diabetic mice used in the study
have a reduced number of β cells. The increase in FBG on day
10 after a momentary decrease on day 5 with glibenclamide treatment
could be due to the long-term toxicity of the drug, leading to β-cell
apoptosis. This is also in agreement with the results reported previously
for the toxicity of such sulfonylurea class of drugs against β
cells.37 On the other hand, the progressive
decrease of FBG for the C+S-treated group could be indicative of the
protective effect of P4 on β cells. With the ability of P4 to
promote insulin secretion, as suggested from the in vitro studies
on MIN6 cells and the in vivo studies indicating the possible ability
of P4 to promote regeneration of β cells, the encapsulation
of P4 further helped prolong its effect, even in the absence of treatment,
beyond 5 days, as observed in Figure 5. This observation strongly emphasized not only the
need for a delivery system to protect the labile compounds extracted
from plants but also the significant role such a delivery system can
play in targeting and sustaining the effect of an orally administered
active ingredient.

In summary, the hypothesis that a food-grade
delivery system could
achieve small-intestine-specific delivery was validated using starch-coated
electrosprayed chnp encapsulated with P4. P4 was found to promote
insulin secretion in MIN6 cells. It was also verified that the delivery
system, with its starch enteric coating, was able to preserve the
bioactivity of P4. A glucose-lowering effect was observed in the diabetic
mice model for the P4-encapsulated delivery system, which continued
even in the absence of the treatment. This could be due to the sustained
effect of the P4-encapsulated delivery system, demonstrating the advantages
of the food-grade delivery system in small-intestine-targeted delivery.
