Transition-metal
dichalcogenide MoS2 nanostructures
have attracted tremendous attention due to their unique properties,
which render them efficient nanoscale functional components for multiple
applications ranging from sensors and biomedical probes to energy
conversion and storage devices. However, despite the wide application
range, the possibility to tune their size, shape, and composition
is still a challenge. At the same time, the correlation of the structure
with the optoelectronic properties is still unresolved. Here, we propose
a new method to synthesize various morphologies of molybdenum sulfide
nanocrystals, on the basis of ultrashort-pulsed laser fragmentation
of MoS2 platelets. Depending on the irradiation conditions,
multiple MoSx morphologies in the form
of nanoribbons, nanospheres, and photoluminescent quantum dots are
obtained. Besides the detailed structural analysis of the various
crystals formed, the structure–property relation is investigated
and discussed.

1 Introduction
Transition-metal
dichalcogenides (TMDs) are unique two-dimensional
(2D) materials due to their fascinating electronic, optical, and catalytic
properties. The MoS2, in particular, is a typical TMD comprising
weakly bonded S–Mo–S sandwiched layers.1 A single MoS2 layer exhibits remarkably different
properties than those of the bulk; the most pronounced one is that
it is a direct-band gap semiconductor2,3 contrary to
the bulk, which shows an indirect band gap of 1.22 eV.4 Their unique properties render them efficient nanoscale
functional components for various applications, including sensors,5 biomedicine,6 and
energy conversion and storage devices.7,8

Besides
this, zero-dimensional (0D) TMDs have been found to exhibit
high stability and extraordinary optoelectronic properties due to
quantum confinement effects.9−11 Such low-dimensional materials
found numerous applications in electrochemical photocatalysis,12,13 bioimaging,14,15 and optoelectronic devices.16 MoS2 nanostructures, in particular,
have been synthesized with different methods, such as ionic liquid-assisted
grinding exfoliation,12 hydrothermal routes,10 electrochemical exfoliation,17 colloidal methods at high temperature,18 laser ablation in liquids,19−26 and via an induced Fenton reaction.27 Among them, the grinding exfoliation12 and the hydrothermal10 methods are time-consuming,
considering that the first requires multiple centrifugation steps
for the size selection of the particles whereas the second demands
18 h of reaction at 220 °C. Besides this, the electrochemical
methods are two-step procedures and use hazardous materials.17,27 Finally, the wet chemistry synthesis requires complex apparatus
such as a Schlenk line and continuous inert gas flow during the reaction
and takes place at high temperature, which increases the time and
cost of the final products.18

The
shape of the MoS2 nanocrystals synthesized via the
methods developed to date, is centrosymmetric, whereas the possibility
to tune their size, shape, and composition is still a challenge. In
this work, we propose a simple and rapid photoinduced method to control
the morphology and stoichiometry of MoSx nanostructures, via ultrashort-pulsed laser irradiation of MoS2 platelets, in solution. It is a single-step, room temperature,
and green process, providing different nanocrystal morphologies without
the need of hazardous materials and additional surface functionalization.
Besides this, it allows fundamental studies of the impact of crystal
structure and morphology on the physicochemical properties of the
MoSx nanostructures. The rather simple
and scalable method under ambient conditions provides unique opportunities
for the cost-effective synthesis of bulk amounts of nanostructures
with controllable size, shape, and stoichiometry.

2 Results and Discussion
The initial colloidal solution of
platelets has been prepared by
laser ablation of a MoS2 powder pellet in deionized water.
For this purpose, a 513 nm laser source, emitting 170 fs pulses with
a repetition rate of 60 kHz, has been used (Figure S1). The platelet colloids obtained by this process were stable
in solution, and no precipitation was observed upon storage for months
at ambient conditions. Subsequently, the aqueous solution of MoS2 platelets was irradiated using a 1030 nm laser source, emitting
170 fs pulses with a high repetition rate of 75 MHz (Figure 1b).

irradiation time of the platelet aqueous
liquid (a). Schematic representation of the experimental setup utilized
for the photoinduced fabrication of the nanostructures in liquid media
under ambient conditions (b). Low-magnification transmission electron
microscopy (TEM) images of the structures (c).

The influence of the irradiation time, ranging from 0 to
10 000
s, on the morphological and structural evolution of the of MoSx nanostructures attained (Figure 1a) was carefully examined by TEM and Raman
experiments. Representative, bright-field low-magnification TEM images
for all structures obtained are presented in Figure 1c. In particular, the initial colloidal solution
before the irradiation comprises bulk-like platelets, which have been
ablated from the MoS2 target. Following 100 s of irradiation,
the as-prepared platelets become thinner (nanosheets), as indicated
by the lighter contrast exhibited in the respective TEM images, while
their lateral size becomes smaller. At 300 s of irradiation, nanoribbons
of 20–50 nm width and length similar to that of the nanosheets
prepared at 100 s are formed. Finally, above 1000 s of irradiation
time, nanospheres are formed, with sizes down to 5 nm; the higher
the exposure time, the lower is the mean nanosphere diameter produced.

Raman spectroscopy was used to probe the vibrational properties
of the different structures formed. As shown in Figure 2, the two Raman peaks associated with 1E2g (in-plane motion of Mo and S in opposite directions)
and A1g (out-of-plane motions of S atoms) active modes
are observed in all cases. In particular, for the nanosheets formed
at 100 s, the two peaks are centered at 383.2 and 407.8 cm–1 (Table S1), in accordance to previous
reports on bulk MoS2.28 Upon
transition from nanosheets to nanoribbons and nanospheres, a characteristic
blue shift and broadening of both peaks were observed. The blue shift
is 3.4 cm–1 for the 1E2g and
2.1 cm–1 for the A1g for the nanosheet-to-nanoribbon
transition. According to the literature, the thinning of bulk MoS2 to ultrathin nanosheets comprising three layers leads to
a blue shift of the 1E2g and A1g modes
of about 0.6 and 2.1 cm–1, respectively.28 In addition, the broadening of these peaks has
been associated with the decrease in the number of layers.29 On the basis of these findings, the large blue
shift of the 1E2g mode could not be solely attributed
to the nanostructures thinning; therefore, another structural parameter
could also play a role (Figure 3). No significant shift was observed, for both modes, upon
the transition from nanoribbons to nanospheres. However, the transformation
of nanospheres to quantum dots gives rise to a further blue shift
for both modes, namely, 4.9 for the 1E2g and
4 cm–1 for the A1g, respectively. This
observation is in contrast to the majority of literature results on
Raman spectra of MoSx nanostructures.
For example, a red shift of the in-plane mode has been observed in
monolayered structures of nanosheet28 or
quantum dot30 morphologies. A large blue
shift has been found only in the case of quantum dots prepared with
an ionic liquid-assisted grinding exfoliation process, associated
with disorder at the particles edges.12 In addition, such large shift of the 1E2g mode
(2.1 cm–1 per % strain) has been found in strained
MoS2 structures.31 The shift
is larger in the case of few-layered structures (2.1 cm–1 per % strain) compared with monolayered ones (1.7 cm–1 per % strain).

s of irradiation (a, b), nanospheres at 1000 s (c, d), nanoribbons

with a Gaussian curve, for the different morphologies obtained ranging
from platelets to quantum dots.

Furthermore, there are
three different mechanisms that would explain
the asymmetric broadening of the Raman peaks: (1) The broadening in
the nanocrystalline materials is described by the phonon confinement
model,32 which leads to a breakup of selection
rules, meaning, also, non-zone-center phonons will participate in
scattering.33−35 (2) The size/shape of the spectral lines is changing
due to size effects of the grown nanostructures.36 (3) The crystallinity of the material could affect the
broadening of the peaks. A well-crystalline material yields a spectrum
with very sharp, intense Raman peaks, whereas an amorphous material
will show broader less intense Raman peaks. These two states (e.g.,
fully amorphous or fully crystalline) can be considered as spectral
extremes, and a Raman spectrum from an intermediate state (e.g., partially
crystalline) will have characteristics that are intermediate in terms
of peak intensity and width (sharpness). On the basis of the Raman
spectroscopy findings on disordered particles and strained layered
structures and the three main mechanisms that could affect the broadening
of the peaks stated above, we may postulate that apart from the reduction
in the number of atomic layers, the laser-induced structural changes
give rise to remarkable strain and disorder effects.

High-resolution
transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) analysis
was used to evaluate the formation mechanism of the various kinds
of nanostructures obtained. In particular, the following was observed.

2.1 For nanoribbons
HRTEM imaging revealed
that the nanoribbons prepared upon 300 s of irradiation are crystalline
(Figure 4) and have
a width of w = 31.6 ± 11.1 nm (Figure S2a). The corresponding FFT patterns for the selected
area, marked by a blue rectangle in the middle of the nanoribbons
in Figure 4, cannot
be indexed with the hexagonal structure of the MoS2 (ICSD,
#049801). The structure is compatible with the monoclinic structure
of the Mo2S3 (ICSD, #073453), as the measured
lattice spacings for the (111) and (101) are 2.8 and 4.4 Å, respectively.
The corresponding Mo2S3 polymorph has been found
in the literature to be formed due to surface phase transformation
upon thermal annealing of MoS2 at a temperature up to 1300
K37 or by sputtering of MoS2 films with low-energy Ar+ ions38. Besides this, irradiation of MoS2 monolayers with an
electron beam leads to the introduction of sulfur vacancies.39 Finally, the MoSx phase was found in nanodots synthesized by the arc-melting method
at 3000 °C, followed by a ball milling process.40

Figure 4 HRTEM image of an individual nanoribbon. The corresponding FFT
patterns for the selected areas marked by rectangles in the middle
(blue) and at the edge (red) of the nanoribbon are also presented.
The zone axis in the image corresponds to the [101̅] direction.
The indexing has been assigned according to the reference pattern
of the monoclinic Mo2S3 structure (ICSD, #073453).

To further shed light on the structural
features of the nanoribbons,
we compared the FFT pattern calculated from an area in the middle
to that at the edge of an individual nanoribbon (Figure 4). Although the central part
is well-crystalline and there is no evidence for grain boundaries,
the FFT pattern corresponding to the nanoribbon edge revealed the
presence of disorder; the observed streaking in diffraction spots,
in particular, indicates the existence of a stacking fault area along
the b axis.

2.2 For nanospheres
Following 1000 s
of laser irradiation, nanospheres of d = 36.2 ±
10.9 nm in diameter (Figure S2b) have been
formed. HRTEM analysis revealed the presence of different types of
particles. The majority are single-phase twined particles (Figure 5a), and a relatively
small number of fullerene-like or amorphous particles (Figures 5b and S5) has been additionally observed. Fullerene particles have
been synthesized by a similar laser-ablation technique in aqueous
solution.26,41 FFT pattern analysis revealed the crystal
structure of the single-phase particles, which is compatible with
the monoclinic structure of the Mo2S3 (ICSD,
#073453). Indeed, lattice fringes with interplanar spacings of 3.0
and 2.2 Å have been identified, which are assigned to the (200)
and (210) of the monoclinic crystal Mo2S3 structure,
respectively. It should be noted here that the crystal structure of
such nanocrystals is the same as that of the nanoribbons, although
a small percentage of nanoparticles exhibit the rhombohedral crystal
symmetry of the Mo3S4 (Figure S3). The coexistence of these two phases in the same sample
has been also found in previous reports.40 The mixture of several molybdenum multisulfides has also been confirmed
from the stoichiometry found by energy-dispersive spectrometry (EDS)
analysis in different areas of the sample (Figure S4). This stoichiometry was found to be MoS (1:1), which is
far away from the stoichiometry Mo/S = 1:2 of the MoS2 target.
Upon careful inspection of the HRTEM images and the corresponding
FFT pattern, it can be concluded that the particles exhibit a quasispherical
morphology of the twined type, revealed by the additional spots between
the spots of the monoclinic phase. Variation of the Mo/S ratio in
MoS2 crystal structures has been found in the literature
that it is associated with the presence of S vacancies.42 Twin defects, dislocations, and grain boundaries
in the crystal structure are accumulated by sulfur vacancies.43,44 A ratio of 1.2 found in substoichiometric bilayers of MoS2 due to lattice distortion originated from exfoliation process using
hydrazine salts.45

two different types of nanospheres, namely,
single-phase twined (a) and fullerene-like (b) nanosphere. The inset
in (a) is an FFT pattern corresponding to an individual nanosphere.
The zone axis is the [001]. The indexing has been assigned according
to the reference pattern of the monoclinic structure of the Mo2S3 (ICSD, #073453).

2.3 For the quantum dots
Quantum dots
with diameter d = 6.5 ± 1.6 nm (Figure S2c) are formed above 10 000 s
of laser irradiation. Selected area diffraction analysis of a random
area of the quantum dot sample (Figure S6) revealed the crystal structure of the quantum dots, which is compatible
to the monoclinic crystal structure of Mo2S3 (Figure 6a). No indication
for molybdenum oxide has been found due to possible oxidation of the
surface.46−48 This conclusion is in good agreement with the Raman
spectra at the higher shift region. Peaks at 666 and 820 nm that could
be assigned to the stretching modes of the triply coordinated oxygen
(Mo3–O) and the doubly coordinated oxygen (Mo2–O) of the a-MoO3 phase49,50 are found only for the case of the nanospheres (Figure S7). The corresponding FFT pattern calculated from
the HRTEM images (Figures 6b and S8) indicated a twined structure.

Figure 6 Selected
area diffraction pattern (SAED) (a), HRTEM image (b),
and photoluminescence spectrum (c) from the quantum dots formed above
10 000 s of laser irradiation. The inset in (b) is the corresponding
FFT pattern calculated for an individual quantum dot (right). The
indexing of the SAED has been assigned according to the reference
pattern of the monoclinic structure of the Mo2S3 (ICSD, #073453).

Notably, the quantum
dots are photoluminescent at room temperature
upon their excitation by a 248 nm laser beam (Figure 6c). In particular, a single PL peak is observed
centered at 448 nm whereas no additional peaks are observed at longer
wavelengths, indicating the absence of quantum dot aggregation. A
similar spectrum has been recorded for the nanospheres (Figure S9). The main features are similar, but
the spectrum of the nanospheres is blue-shifted compared to that of
quantum dots. This is a contradictory result if we consider the particle
size of the two samples. This is due to existence of different particles
(mainly of MoO3) in the sample of the nanospheres.

Similar spectra have been recorded for water soluble 1,4-diaminobutane-functionalized
MoS2 quantum dots of about 5 nm synthesized by a bottom-up
approach.51

On the basis of the above
analysis, we may speculate on the formation
mechanism that accounts for the structure and shape evolution of the
various MoSx nanostructures observed (Figure 7). Initially, laser
irradiation of MoS2 platelets gives rise to the photoinduced
exfoliation to form few-layered nanosheets. The subsequent irradiation
of nanosheets leads to the photoinduced unzipping52−54 of the nanosheets’
edges to form nanoribbons, which are crystalline in the Mo2S3 structure, exhibiting structural defects at their edges.
This explanation complies with previous reports, where the Mo2S3 polymorph was found at the edges of MoS2 nanosheets.37 Upon further irradiation,
the nanoribbons transform in nanospheres through a laser-induced melting
and subsequent resolidification.41,55 The temperature
in the irradiated area due to the laser energy absorption is increased
above the melting point of the material, and melted MoSx droplets are formed. The resolidification occurs
when the surface temperature of the droplets reduces below the melting
point of MoSx. The preferable shape of
these structures tends to be spherical to reduce their surface energy.
The observed strained structure of the nanoparticles revealed by HRTEM
analysis could explain the large blue shift observed in the respective
Raman modes. Finally, the nanoparticles break into smaller particles
in the form of quantum dots, due to laser-induced ablative fragmentation
of the larger nanospheres56,57 indicated by the preservation
of the initial Mo2S3 twined structure.

formation mechanism for the different MoSx morphologies.

3 Conclusions
In summary, this work illustrates that laser irradiation of MoS2 bulklike platelets could be used as an effective way for
the synthesis of different morphologies of molybdenum multisulfides.
This approach is simple, scalable, performed under ambient conditions,
and can therefore be useful for the cost-effective synthesis of bulk
amounts of nanostructures with controllable size, shape, and stoichiometry.
More important, the various nanocrystal morphologies can be produced
without the need of hazardous chemicals and additional surface functionalization
processes, which make this technique appealing for many potential
applications.

4 Material and Methods
4.1 Preparation of the Different Colloids
4.1.1 Production
of the Aqueous Solution of MoS2 Platelets
Initially,
a MoS2 target has
been prepared via pressing MoS2 powder into a pellet of
15 mm diameter. This target was placed at the bottom of a glass vial
and immersed into 2 mL of deionized water. Subsequently, the beam
of a Yb:KGW femtosecond laser was focused through the water layer,
onto the target to exfoliate the MoS2 powder into platelets
(Figure S1). The laser wavelength, the
repetition rate, the pulse duration, and the power used for this purpose
were 513 nm, 60 kHz, 170 fs, and 90 mW, respectively. The total ablation
time was 10 min. During laser irradiation, the target was continuously
rotated using a rotation stage. All solutions obtained after irradiation
were centrifuged at 1500 RPM for 10 min. Then, the supernatant colloidal
solution is placed in a quartz cuvette for subsequent irradiation.

4.1.2 Synthesis of MoSx Nanostructures
(Figure 1)
The as-prepared aqueous solution of the MoS2 platelets
was divided into 5 equivalent aliquots. Then, each
aliquot was irradiated for 100, 300, 1000, 3000, and 10 000
s, respectively, using the same laser system, although at different
irradiation parameters. In this case, the wavelength, repetition rate,
pulse duration, and power used were 1026 nm, 75 MHz, 170 fs, and 4
mW, respectively. During the irradiation process, the colloidal solution
was continuously agitated via use of a magnetic stirrer. The synthesis
is reproducible, but the yield is low.

4.2 Characterization
of the Colloidal Solutions
4.2.1 Transmission Electron
Microscopy (TEM)
Low-magnification and high-resolution TEM
(HRTEM) images were recorded
on a JEOL 2100 transmission electron microscope, operating at an accelerating
voltage of 200 kV. For the purposes of the TEM analysis, a drop of
the aqueous colloidal solution was deposited onto a carbon-coated
copper TEM grid and then the solvent was allowed to evaporate. All
images were recorded by a Gatan ORIUS SC 1000 CCD camera, whereas
the structural features of the nanostructures were studied by two-dimensional
(2D) fast Fourier transform (FFT) analysis.

4.2.2 Raman
Spectroscopy
Raman measurements
were performed at room temperature using a Horiba LabRAM HR Evolution
confocal micro-spectrometer, in backscattering geometry (180°),
equipped with an air-cooled solid-state laser operating at 532 nm,
with 100 mW output power. The laser beam was focused on the samples
using a 50× Olympus microscope objective (numerical aperture
of 0.50), providing a ∼22.5 mW power on each sample. Raman
spectra over the 10–3000 cm–1 wavenumber
range (with an exposure time of 20 s and 5 accumulations) were collected
by a Peltier cooled CCD (1024 × 256 pixels) detector at −60
°C, with a resolution better than 1 cm–1 achieved
thanks to an 1800 grooves/mm grating and an 800 mm focal length. Test
measurements were carried out using different optical configurations,
exposure time, beam power, and accumulations to obtain sufficiently
informative spectra using a confocal hole of 100 μm but ensuring
to avoid alteration of the sample, whereas the high spatial resolution
allowed us to carefully verify the sample homogeneity. The wavelength
scale was calibrated using a Silicon standard (520.7 cm–1), and the acquired spectra were compared with scientific published
data and reference databases, such as Horiba LabSpec 6 (Horiba).

4.2.3 Laser-Induced Fluorescence (LIF) Spectroscopy
Each solution was placed in quartz cuvette without further dilution,
and the respective PL spectra were recorded at room temperature. For
sample excitation, a KrF excimer laser, operating at 248 nm has been
utilized. The pulse duration was about 20 ns, the excitation energy
∼3.2 mJ, and the laser beam diameter 9.0 mm (fluence ∼5
mJ/cm2). The fluorescence measurements were performed at
room temperature and recorded by a monochromator (PTI Technology)
that is connected with an Andor iStar 734 Series Intensified Charge
Coupled Device. The fluorescence signal of the samples was collected
and guided to the spectrograph by an optical fiber.

4.2.4 Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Energy-Dispersive
X-ray Spectroscopy (EDS)
SEM (JEOL 7000), equipped with an
EDS (INCA PentaFET-x3), was used for the analysis of the samples.
These experiments were performed on solid-state samples produced after
drying a small volume of the corresponding colloidal solution on a
piece of a single-crystalline silicon wafer.
