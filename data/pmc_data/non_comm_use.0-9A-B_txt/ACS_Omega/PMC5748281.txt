Phenolic
compounds and their derivatives are ubiquitous constituents
of numerous synthetic and natural chemicals that exist in the environment.
Their toxicity is mostly attributed to their hydrophobicity and/or
the formation of free radicals. In a continuation of the study of
phenolic toxicity in a systematic manner, we have examined the biological
responses of Saccharomyces cerevisiae to a series of mostly monosubstituted phenols utilizing a quantitative
structure–activity relationship (QSAR) approach. The biological
end points included a growth assay that determines the levels of growth
inhibition induced by the phenols as well as a yeast deletion (DEL)
assay that assesses the ability of X-phenols to induce DNA damage
or DNA breaks. The QSAR analysis of cell growth patterns determined
by IC50 and IC80 values indicates that toxicity
is delineated by a hydrophobic, parabolic model. The DEL assay was
then utilized to detect genomic deletions in yeast. The increase in
the genotoxicity was enhanced by the electrophilicity of the phenolic
substituents that were strong electron donors as well as by minimal
hydrophobicity. The electrophilicities are represented by Brown’s
sigma plus values that are a variant of the Hammett sigma constants.
A few mutant strains of genes involved in DNA repair were separately
exposed to 2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-methyl-phenol (BHT)
and butylated hydroxy anisole (BHA). They were subsequently screened
for growth phenotypes. BHA-induced growth defects in most of the DNA
repair null mutant strains, whereas BHT was unresponsive.

Introduction
Phenolic compounds
are ubiquitous in nature and in man-made products.
Their role as antioxidants are well-documented, as seen in the case
of food preservatives and flavonoids, whose mechanism of action involves
a consecutive 2-electron oxidation of the β-ring.1−4 However, under certain conditions such as concentration levels,
pH, and presence of metal ions, phenolics have been found to be pro-oxidants
by generating an increase in the reactive oxygen species (ROS) in
cancerous cells that triggers apoptotic DNA fragmentation.5 Phenol and other benzene-like compounds have
been shown to cause statistically significant DNA damage,6,7 whereas other phenols have been shown to protect DNA from damage.7

Clearly, this mixed behavior of simple
and complex phenols in eliciting
cellular responses has not been clearly delineated and thus warrants
further investigation in a systematic manner. In this study, the quantitative
structure–activity relationship (QSAR) paradigm8 was used to delineate the biological responses of the yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, in terms of the physicochemical
attributes of a series of para-substituted phenolic compounds. Previous
work in our laboratory had examined the cytotoxic and apoptotic effects
of various mono-, di-, and trisubstituted phenols on mouse leukemia
cells.9 Two parameters were found to be
of critical importance in determining the overall cytotoxicity of
electron-rich substituted phenols: their hydrophobicities and their
electron densities.10−12 See eqs 1 and 2. 1   2  

In these QSAR equations, ID50 represents the molar concentration
of X-phenol that results in a 50% inhibition of growth in murine leukemia
cells.12 σ+ is Brown’s
refinement of the Hammett sigma (σ) constant, which represents
the electron-releasing ability of the various substituents, whereas
BDE reflects the bond dissociation energy of the O–H bond.
log P represents the calculated octanol–water
partition coefficient of each phenol. In all models, n represents the number of data points in the study, r is the correlation coefficient, s is the standard
deviation of the regression equation, and q2 comprises the cross-validated r2. The
coefficient with the hydrophobic term is small and indicates that
a surface interaction with a minimally hydrophobic/semipolar receptor
is in play. The strong dependence on σ+, as indicated
by the coefficient (1.35) also suggests that radical stabilization
could be favored by nucleic acids or polar enzymes.13

In this study, two simple, robust, and inexpensive
in vivo yeast
assays combined with the powerful predicting capabilities of the QSAR
analysis were used to determine the variables that define the activity
of X-phenols in S. cerevisiae. Because
yeast and humans share many orthologues and conserved pathways, molecular
mechanisms of toxicity identified in yeast may be relevant to understanding
the mechanism of toxicity of the same set of compounds in human cells.14

Two different biological responses pertaining
to yeast treated
with various X-phenols were measured and assessed. Growth assays were
utilized to determine the levels of toxicity induced by a series of
X-phenols by measuring the extent of growth inhibition and determining
their inhibition concentrations (ICs). This was followed by a genetic
assay, that is, the yeast deletion (DEL) assay that was used as an
indirect method to assess the capability of X-phenols to induce DNA
damage or DNA breaks.15 The DEL assay,
developed by Schiestl, measures the induction of deletion events in S. cerevisiae and has been used to detect carcinogenic
and clastogenic activities with great success.16,17 The selection of this genetic assay is underscored by three attributes:
its sensitivity as confirmed by its ability to detect carcinogens
that other short-term genotoxicity assays consistently fail to detect,15 its specificity in distinguishing between noncarcinogenic
and carcinogenic structural analogs,18 and
its excellent (86%) accuracy at detecting known carcinogens as compared
to only 29% accuracy achieved with the Salmonella (Ames) assay.16

To delineate the mechanism of phenol toxicity
in yeast, QSAR analysis
of ICs from growth inhibition studies as well as deletion frequencies
from deletion assays were carried out. By combining the predictive
capabilities of QSAR with a simple and reliable in vivo system, this
study describes an approach that can be utilized not only to identify
potential clastogens but also to address the mechanisms of toxicity
and genotoxicity of xenobiotics. Results obtained in this study using
yeast as a model system will help identify potential carcinogens in
humans and yield insight into the mechanism of the associated chemical
toxicity.

Results
Toxicity of X-Phenols in S.
cerevisiae
To assess the effects of 4-X-phenols
on cell growth and
to further examine the cellular response at biologically relevant
concentrations, yeast cells are exposed to phenolic compounds, and
the extent of growth inhibition is determined. The heterogenous set
of X-phenols tested for cytotoxicity includes phenols of varying physicochemical
attributes, such as electron density, hydrophobicity, and sterics.
In addition, polysubstituted phenols such as butylated hydroxy anisole
(BHA) and 2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-methyl-phenol (BHT)
are also included in the study.

Although the compounds tested
were toxic to S. cerevisiae, there
was a wide range in potencies. 4-Sulfonamido-phenol was the least
potent with an IC50 value of 318 mM, whereas 4-nonylphenol
was the most potent with an IC50 of 0.02 mM (Table S1). These results suggest that the variability
of substituents greatly affects the toxicity of the corresponding
phenols, as has been previously observed in mammalian cells.9,10,19

Hydrophobicity, a Chemical
Parameter Influencing the Toxicity
of X-Phenols
Evaluation of the growth inhibition data indicates
that the most significant factor affecting the potency of X-phenol
appears to be hydrophobicity, as represented by log P (partition coefficients) in Figure 1.

Figure 1 Correlation between toxicity and hydrophobicity of phenols
used
in this study. IC50 values used were obtained for each
phenol with the growth assay (square markers, see Table 1). The data for 4-dodecylphenol are an exception; they represent
an approximate IC40 value because its poor solubility precluded
testing at higher concentrations (triangle marker).

In the present study, the QSAR analysis was performed
to delineate
the effects of the physicochemical attributes of X-phenols on their
associated toxicity activities. From the data in Table 1, a stepwise regression analysis
was carried out, and the following QSARs were derived using the Hansch
linear and parabolic models.20 Two phenols,
4-nitrophenol and catechol, were omitted from eqs 3–6 and Tables 1 and 2. 3   4

Equations 3 and 4 both indicate the importance of hydrophobicity in
the toxicity of X-phenols. The coefficient of the log P term in eq 4 is close
to 1, which suggests that X-phenols are mostly desolvated in the hydrophobic
milieu of yeast.20 The statistical parameters
of eq 4 (r2, q2, and s) are superior to those of eq 3. The F tests indicate that eq 3 (F1,16 α0.01 = 8.53) and 4 (F1,15 α0.01 = 8.68) are highly significant. The parabolic model is a more robust
predictor of toxicity than the linear model. The poor solubility of
X-phenols with log P values greater than 6.5 precluded
their inclusion in this dataset.

A subsequent QSAR analysis
with IC80 values obtained
from the growth assays also corroborates the delineation of the parabolic,
hydrophobic model for phenol toxicity (see Table 2). Equation 6 is a much better fit and a predictor of toxicity than
the linear model (eq 5). The IC80 data yield similar models to those of IC50 models, when one compares eqs 3, 5 and 4, 6. The two models pertaining to the IC80 toxicities are listed below: 5   6  

The parabolic model is a much better fit with higher r2 (0.950) and q2 values (0.910);
it indicates that 95% of the variance in the data can be explained
by hydrophobicity alone. On the basis of the QSAR analysis of the
data obtained from the growth assays, it is apparent that the overall
toxicity induced by X-phenols in this study is highly influenced by
their corresponding hydrophobicities. Equations 5 (F1,16 α0.01 = 8.53) and 6 (F1,15 α0.05 = 4.54) are also highly significant. Although the curve appears
to taper off around 4-nonylphenol, compounds with greater hydrophobicity,
such as 4-dodecylphenol, were subjected to testing, but poor water
solubility and high hydrophobicity (clog P = 7.79)
precluded further analysis. The dose–response curve with 4-dodecylphenol
achieved 40% growth inhibition at 0.35 mM, a value much higher than
the IC50 value for 4-nonylphenol at 0.02 mM. This result
clearly indicates that 4-dodecylphenol is much less potent than 4-nonylphenol,
confirming the predicted downward trend of the parabolic model for
compounds of higher hydrophobicity.

In the development of eqs 3–6, there were two outliers:
4-nitrophenol and catechol with toxicities much higher than expected.
The substituents on these phenols are reactive entities. In cellular
systems, the nitro-moiety is prone to reduction and generation of
toxic species such as the nitroso and/or hydroxylamine moieties. 4-Nitrophenol
has also consistently been seen to be more toxic than computational
models normally predict.21 In the current
study, 4-nitrophenol deviates significantly (>3×) when compared
to other phenolic congeners, which indicates that other mechanisms
are also at play. Catechol, which is easily oxidized, appears to be
4 times more toxic than expected. This may be attributed to its rapid
metabolism to other quinones in yeast.22 Electronic effects of the substituents of all phenols were also
examined in the QSAR analysis but failed to pass muster.

A toxicity
study of a series of multisubstituted phenols on yeast
cells was examined by Arnold et al., who utilized a different electro-rotation
approach to toxicity.4,23 Electro-rotation is a well-established
physical method that involves the noninvasive induction of rotation
of yeast by a rotating electric field because the characteristics
of its membranes have been shown to affect electro-rotation. An accessible
frequency range is utilized to yield the electro-rotation spectra.4 Control yeast cells showed both anti- and cofield
rotations (CFRs). However, yeast treated mostly by halogenated phenols
behaved differently and yielded a much stronger CFR and practically
little or no antifield rotation in this study. The proportion of cells
showing the CFR was determined to be a sensitive measure of toxicity.

Using this data that represented the concentrations of X-phenols
that yielded 50% CFRs, the following QSAR was developed. See Table 3. Two substituted
phenols, 4-nitrophenol and 2-methyl, 4,6-dinitrophenol, were omitted
from the development of the QSAR models. 7

In eq 7, the clog P coefficient is close to 0.8 that indicates that X-phenols
are mostly desolvated in the biomembrane. With regard to the statistics,
the r2 value is 0.953, and the q2 value is 0.937, whereas the F statistic is F1,21 α0.01 =
8.02. Two phenols, 4-nitrophenol and 2-methyl, 4,6-dinitrophenol,
were outliers; they are 12 times and 3 times, respectively, more active
than predicted.4,23 4-Nitrophenol has a significantly
high deviation in the rotation assay, which could be attributed to
a strong thru-resonance that enhances uncoupling and inhibits purine
transport. Although 2-methyl, 4,6-dinitrophenol also acts as an uncoupler,
its overall activity is mitigated by its acidic pKa that enhances ionization and thus marginally enhances
the overall cell toxicity. The range in clog P values
of this set of phenols extends from 1.12 to 5.13, a spread of only
4 log units, which is inadequate to determine the optimum hydrophobicity
of the system. The range in clog P of the first data
set runs from −0.50 to 6.21—a spread of 6.7 log units
that allows for the determination of clog Po of approximately 8.8.

Cytotoxicity
Our results indicate
that there is a strong
correlation between hydrophobicity and toxicity in yeast cells (Figure 1 and eqs 3–6). However, when similar QSAR studies were conducted in murine leukemia
cells, phenols with electron-donating groups (EDGs) and electron-withdrawing
groups (EWGs) behaved differently. The cytotoxicity of phenols with
EWGs correlated with hydrophobicity, whereas phenols with EDGs presented
a very low correlation with hydrophobicity.9,12,24 The drastic mechanistic difference between
yeast and murine leukemia cells may be attributed to the cell wall
of yeast cells that present some type of barrier that is not existent
in mammalian cells. This barrier contains mannoproteins and β-glucans,
which are abundant components of yeast cell walls with some hydrophobic
characteristics.25 They could readily enhance
transport of hydrophobic X-phenols in yeast cells.

When studying
the cytotoxicity of a series of para-substituted phenols in murine
leukemia cells, Selassie et al. predicted that substituents with EDGs
would result in DNA damage through a phenoxy radical mechanism.9 Hence, yeast was used as a model system to test
this hypothesis because the yeast DEL assay is a well-defined and
consistent method for measuring the presence of DNA breaks in the
cell.17 The results obtained were analyzed
by QSAR, and the prediction that X-phenols with EDGs would interact
with DNA to cause damage was confirmed.

Genomic Rearrangements
Induced by 4-X-Phenols
The toxicity
indices induced by the phenols could be attributed to several different
cellular targets. The focus was on identifying and predicting which
phenols would result in DNA damage, particularly in deletion formation,
a type of genomic rearrangement that in higher eukaryotic cells can
result in neoplastic transformation.26−28 Genomic deletions in
yeast cells induced by chemicals can be readily detected by the DEL
(deletion) assay. Compounds that cause single- and double-strand breaks
or oxidative damage will lead to a significant increase in the deletion
events17 and genomic instability.29 These qualities of the DEL assay are known to
correctly identify carcinogenic compounds with a greater success than
other short-term genotoxicity tests.16

The yeast DEL assay is a simple method in which the frequency of
deletion events in the yeast genome is calculated after treating cells
with a suspected damaging agent. The deletion events result from an
intrachromosomal recombination between two truncated his3 alleles that share approximately 400 bp of homologous sequences
flanking a genetic marker. One allele is truncated at its 3′
end and the other at its 5′ end resulting in a histidine auxotroph
mutant. A homologous recombination between the his3 direct repeats results in deletion of the intervening sequence and
restoration of a functional HIS3 gene, giving rise
to histidine prototrophs (Figure 2). The frequency of deletion formation is determined
by dividing the number of recombinant cell colonies by the total number
of cells. The total number of cells is calculated by plating cells
onto histidine-containing media, whereas the recombinant cells give
origin to colonies growing in agar medium lacking histidine. In this
study, the recombination frequencies of cells exposed to IC80 concentrations of phenol will be compared to the frequency of recombination
in a negative control consisting of cells exposed only to the solvent
[1–3% dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO)]. The effect of a phenolic compound
is considered to be positive for inducing recombination when the treatment
of cells results in deletion frequencies 2-fold or higher than that
of the negative control.16,30 The DEL assay will
therefore not only identify which phenols induce DNA damage in S. cerevisiae but also identify potential carcinogenic
compounds and provide a biological descriptor to be used in a QSAR
analysis to provide insight into the mechanism of phenolic toxicity.
Testing structurally related compounds with different substituents
that confer different physicochemical properties will help elucidate
a potential mechanism of phenol toxicity.

Figure 2 Deletion Assay. Diagram
of the DEL(URA3) assay.
(A) At the HIS3 locus, yeast strains carry a construct
with a functional URA3 gene flanked on both sides
by his3 sequences. The upstream his3 allele lacks its 3′ end and the downstream his3 allele lacks its 5′ end and both contain his3 direct repeated sequences of 415 bp (indicated in diagram as gray
shaded boxes). (B) Direct repeats can recombine by homologous recombination
by several different mechanisms, not discussed in figure, resulting
in deletion of all intervening sequences. (C) A deletion event by
homologous recombination results in a functional HIS3 gene.

The first growth and deletion
assays were performed using the yeast
DEL(LEU2) strain kindly provided by Robert Schiestl
(RS112). Subsequent experiments were performed using DEL(URA3) provided by Adam Bailis that yielded similar results. We continued
our analysis with the DEL(URA3) assay system as our
laboratory strains are isogenic to those of the Bailis laboratory,
facilitating our genetic analysis. This strain consists of HIS3 repeats flanking a URA3 marker inserted
at the HIS3 locus31 instead
of the LEU2 marker used in RS112. Growth assays were
repeated with several of the phenolic compounds tested with RS112,
and the same or very similar IC values were obtained. In addition,
included in the phenolic derivatives tested in this study for deletion
formation, hydroquinone and catechol had been tested by Schiestl’s
group with the DEL(LEU2) assay;22 we obtained similar results with our modified deletion
assay. Having a different DEL assay strain resulted in reproducible
and similar findings to those obtained by Schiestl’s group.

To gain a comprehensive view of phenol toxicity and its ability
to induce DNA damage, the DEL(URA3) assay was performed
on a select group of compounds containing different chemical properties.
DEL assays were successfully conducted at IC80 concentrations
of the following 14 phenols: 4-nitrophenol, 4-methoxyphenol, 4-hydroquinone,
phenol, BHA, BHT, 4-cyanophenol, 4-chlorophenol, 4-flourophenol, 4-bromophenol,
4-nonylphenol, catechol, 2-tert-butyl-4-methoxy-phenol
(BHA-2), and 3-tert-butyl-4-methoxy-phenol (BHA-3).
The IC80 concentration is used to ensure that the assay
is carried out under conditions that will not cause more than 90%
growth inhibition, and the growing conditions used are the same as
those used for determining the IC values (growth assay). Of the 14
compounds tested, 9 resulted in recombination frequencies that are
2-fold or higher than the frequency obtained for control cells treated
only with the solvent (2% DMSO) (Figure 3 and Supporting Information Table S2). The percent viability of treated cells was determined
by counting the colony-forming units. Treatments with IC80 values resulted in an average of 30% viability.

Figure 3 Deletion formation induced
by phenolic compounds. A series of phenolic
compounds were tested for their ability to induce deletion formation
in yeast cells carrying the DEL(URA3) assay. Cells
were treated with an IC80 concentration of the indicated
phenols for 17 h. Appropriate dilutions of treated cells were plated
onto SC-Ura plates to determine the number of viable cells and onto
SC-His to determine the number of cells that have undergone deletion
formation by homologous recombination. The frequency of deletion formation
(His+ cells) is calculated by dividing the total number
of His+ cells by the total number of viable cells. Untreated
cells also were run through this assay to determine the baseline frequency
of deletion formation in untreated cells (for details, see the deletion
assay in the Methods Section). The plot of the DEL frequency is determined
by the ratio of the deletion frequency of the treated sample to the
deletion frequency of the untreated control. The horizontal line drawn
at a value of 2 clearly identifies those phenolic compounds that induced
a deletion frequency that was 2-fold or higher than the untreated
control.

Among the eight compounds that
caused an increase in the DEL recombination
of at least 2-fold over the control, there is an overrepresentation
of phenolic compounds with electron-donating substituents (Figure 3).

QSAR of the
DNA Deletion Frequency
A QSAR analysis
of the DNA deletion frequency was performed to elucidate the mechanism
of this chemical–biological interaction in yeast and determine
if there is a relationship between the physicochemical properties
of X-phenols and the ability to induce deletion events in yeast cells.
It is well-established that many radical cations of substituted phenols
are correlated by σ+, the Brown variant of the Hammett
electronic parameter.32 Thus, this descriptor
and hydrophobicity were utilized for the QSAR analysis. The biological
descriptor DNA-R represents the increase in the deletion frequency
compared to control cells. See Table 4.

a Fold increase over untreated control
is presented. Fold increase in deletion formation was determined by
dividing the frequency of recombination of cells treated with X-phenol
(average of three samples) by the frequency of recombination of cells
treated only with the solvent (untreated control), as explained in
the experimental procedures.

d Outliers not included
in the derivation
of eq 9.

Using this data, the following QSAR
models, 8 and 9, were
formulated. 8   9  

Equation 9 indicates
that 52% of the variance in the data can be attributed primarily to
the electrophilicity of the EDG substituents, whereas hydrophobicity
accounts for 22% of the variance in the data. The range in the deletion
frequency is 1.55 units, which is limiting. The correlation between
DEL formation and electrophilicity plus hydrophobicity yields a suitable
fit of the data with an r2 value of 0.74,
a cross-validated q2 value of 0.49, and
a standard deviation of 0.22. The small number of compounds in this
study (N = 14) and the limited range in activity
could account for the low r2 value in
this equation and therefore can potentially be improved with the addition
of more data points (see Table 4).

There are three outliers in this dataset: phenol,
BHA-3, and BHT.
The latter two are highly hydrophobic, bulky, and sterically hindered
by interactions between the t-butyl substituent and
the methoxy group in the 3-t-butyl-4-methoxy-phenol
and the crowded “flanking” of the hydroxyl group by
the t-butyl groups in BHT. See Figure 4.

Figure 4 Steric hindrance in BHT and BHA-3. Deletion
frequency fold increase
values, from Table 4, are indicated for each compound.

The steric repulsions can be described by the size of the
critical
substituents involved in the negative interactions. Molar refraction
(MR) of a substituent is an appropriate reflection of its size and
can be used to delineate the interactions between the substituents
on a molecule. The hydroxyl group (MR = 0.28) of BHT is closely flanked
by two bulky tert-butyl groups (MR = 1.96) that would
impede easy accessibility to DNA, hence its low deletion index of
1.70. With BHA-3, the methoxy group (MR = 0.79) is right up against
the bulky t-butyl group that would distort the planarity
of the phenyl ring and reduce its ability to interact with DNA. This
behavior contrasts sharply with that on BHA-2, whereby the smaller
hydroxyl group (MR = 0.28) is ortho to the t-butyl
group and has a higher deletion frequency. Apparently, interactions
with DNA are impaired by phenols with high hydrophobicities and bulky
substituents. Phenol is also an outlier and an anomaly. Triplicate
tests were run, but it always yielded the same outcome. It behaved
well in the cytotoxicity tests but not the deletion assay. Studies
have shown that phenol can inhibit DNA synthesis and replication in
HeLa cells.33 Thus, it is possible that
phenol could disrupt the DNA synthesis in yeast, resulting in a higher
recombination frequency.

Genetic Pathways Involved in the Response
to Phenol Treatment
The induction of deletion formation by
phenol treatment is indirect
evidence that DNA damage is occurring and is a consequence of the
treatment of cells with a small set of these phenolic compounds. If
cells are accumulating damaged DNA, the cell must respond and try
to repair this damage. A genetic approach was utilized in which several
null mutant strains of genes involved in DNA repair were treated with
phenolic compounds and screened for growth phenotypes. The test included
BHA, a compound that resulted in greater than 2-fold deletion formation
(DEL+), and BHT, that did not increase deletion formation
over 2-fold (DEL–). Serial dilutions of each strain
were plated using a 96-pin replicator onto synthetic complete (SC)
plates with or without BHA or BHT. A comparison of the level of growth
against the WT strain to the growth observed for each strain in the
untreated control plate (no phenolic compound + DMSO) clearly identified
strains that are resistant, sensitive, or nonresponsive (Figure 5). These results
indicate that DNA repair proteins are an integral part of the cellular
response to treatment with phenols that elicit a genotoxic effect.
Clearly, BHA causes growth defects in most of the DNA repair null
mutant strains tested, whereas the response to BHT was negligible.

mutant strains.

Discussion
Cytotoxicity
in Yeast Cells
To delineate the effects
of phenol toxicity in yeast cells, a kill curve was first established,
and various specific concentrations were determined for this study.
Yeast cells were grown in liquid media and exposed to different concentrations
of a particular compound in a 96-well plate format, which allows for
rapid screening of many compounds at the same time and the subsequent
generation of dose–response curves. From these curves, IC50 and IC80 values were determined for each compound
tested. This ensured that in yeast cells treated with IC50, IC80, or in between concentrations, growth inhibition
would not exceed 90%, and viability measured by colony forming units
did not go below 10% (see Table S1). This
approach avoided the use of concentrations of compounds tested that
may have resulted in acute effects that are not biologically relevant
and are not a focus of this study.

To determine if various structural
changes in phenols could affect the toxicity to yeast cells, a systematic
approach that included a variation of substituents in the size, hydrophobicity,
electronic attributes, and position was examined. The first biological
response to be analyzed was cytotoxicity. QSAR analysis identified
a strong correlation between cytotoxicity and hydrophobicity of the
compounds tested. Cytotoxicity increased with the hydrophobicity of
the compounds tested, up to a certain point (clog P 7.5), after which the increase in hydrophobicity resulted in a downward
toxicity trajectory.

The correlation between hydrophobicity
and toxicity appears to
be a strong relationship observed in yeast cells. When similar QSAR
studies were done in murine leukemia cells, looking at the toxicity
of para-substituted phenols, those with EDGs and EWGs behaved differently.
The cytotoxicity of phenols with EWGs correlated with hydrophobicity,
whereas phenols with EDGs showed a very low correlation with hydrophobicity.9,12,34 The reason for this discrepancy
observed between yeast and mammalian cells may be attributed to differences
in how and how much of the tested phenols can penetrate and accumulate
within cells. Cells have two main mechanisms to control the actual
amount of a particular chemical that is found inside the cell: the
presence of a physical barrier and mechanisms of detoxification. The
plasma membrane acts as a barrier between the outside and inside of
a cell, and in the case of yeast cells, there is in addition, a cell
wall. The detoxifying mechanisms present in yeast and mammalian membranes
are not completely understood but they are known to present a wide
range of specificity and redundancy in terms of having overlapping
specificities. Because of the wide range of transporters available
in both systems, we do not believe detoxifying mechanisms cause the
difference observed between mammalian and yeast cells.35 This critical difference may be attributed to
the cell wall of yeast cells.36,37

Mechanism of Phenol Toxicity
Phenols have the ability
to quench the ROS by donating hydrogen atoms to superoxide or hydroxyradicals
in mammalian cells. The phenoxy radical formed is a less reactive
molecule that will stop the propagation of radical reactions preventing
damage to macromolecules within the cell as well as overall detrimental
effects to cells.9,38,39 Phenols with substituents that are EDGs in the para position will
help stabilize the phenoxy radical formed inside the cell and propagate
an oxidative stress state by being more reactive and inducing the
formation of superoxide, hydroxyradicals, hydrogen peroxide, or oxidation
products of the phenoxy radical that can react with DNA, causing strand
breaks. The strong negative dependence on Brown’s sigma-plus
constant suggests that the electron-donating capability of the phenols
enhances DNA damage. This result is significant because it also indicates
that a radical mechanism may be at play, implicating a phenoxy radical
in the generation of DNA damage. Electron-withdrawing substituents
in the para position would decrease the likelihood of a phenol causing
an increase in deletion formation, whereas electron-donating substituents
would increase its likelihood to be more damaging. Selassie et al.
studied the toxicity of a similar set of X-phenols in a murine cell
line and proposed that a radical mechanism was at play.9 Our current study using yeast as a model system
supports this hypothesis; it suggests the formation of a phenoxy radical
as the culprit for cell toxicity and identifies DNA as one of the
putative end targets.

In yeast, previous results obtained by
Schiestl match our prediction that phenolic compounds with EDGs will
result in greater genotoxicity than phenols with EWGs. When assaying
aniline metabolites, 4-aminophenol caused a greater than 2-fold increase
in deletion frequencies over untreated control cells, whereas 4-acetamidophenol,
another metabolite with a moderate electron donor substituent, did
not show a significant increase.15 The
amino group of 4-aminophenol is a much more potent electron donor
(σ+ = −1.30) than the acetomido substituent
of 4-acetamidophenol (σ+ = −0.60). In the
latter case, the electrons are more delocalized over the nitrogen
and oxygen atoms.

Among the compounds tested, a couple of more
complex phenols, such
as BHA and BHT, were tested for toxicity and genotoxicity. Even though
these two compounds have similar structures, BHA-treated cells resulted
in a significant increase in deletion events, whereas BHT showed no
significant genotoxicity. Because BHA is a mixture of two isomers,
BHA-2 and BHA-3, the DEL assay was performed with cells treated with
each individual isomer. Cells treated with BHA-2 phenol resulted in
a greater than 2-fold deletion formation, whereas the BHA-3 isomer
had a minimal effect. It must be noted that hydroquinone, catechol,
and phenol, all produce a similar increase in the DEL frequency but
their potencies are different. Catechol is an outlier in the potency
data (Tables 1 and 2), but its predicted genotoxicity based on eq 8 is in line with the prediction.
It is well-known that catechol is easily oxidized in air and in vivo
because of interaction with heavy metals or cell metabolism that results
in redox reactions.11,40 However, phenol turns out to
be an outlier in the DEL assay based on its σ+ value
and hydrophobicity.

Shadnia and Wright propose that after the
phenoxyradical is formed,
phenols with EDGs can rapidly form a quinone intermediate, and quinone
is responsible for reacting with DNA.11 Prevention of the formation of quinone would thus render the phenol
intermediates less genotoxic. A mechanism to reduce quinone formation
is to block the ortho position of the phenolic ring by bulky substituents
or to have EWGs on the phenol ring. Our results indicate that phenols
with EWGs do not express genotoxicity in addition to the more complex
phenolic compounds with blocked ortho positions that do not increase
the deletion formation in yeast (i.e., BHT and BHA-3).

Genetic Control
of Phenol Response
To gain insight
into the molecular mechanism of toxicity due to phenol exposure, a
genetic approach was taken. Yeast strains with gene deletions in important
DNA repair genes were exposed to phenols, and their growth was assessed
in a spot assay. The mutant strains that were screened lack genes
that play a role in the nucleotide excision repair (NER) and base
excision repair (BER) pathways. NER deals mainly with bulky DNA lesions
or those that distort the DNA backbone such as damage caused by UV
light. Growing evidence suggests that NER is involved in the repair
of other types of DNA lesions such as those generated by oxidative
damage,41,42 which are handled mainly by BER. In Figure 5, null mutant strains
for NER and BER genes all show some level of growth defect when exposed
to BHA, for example, Δrad4 and Δrad14 strains. The Rad4 protein is involved in one of the
first steps in the NER pathway, identifying DNA damage and recruiting
other NER proteins to the site.43,44 The Rad14 protein is
involved in recruiting one of the endonucleases, Rad1, to the site
of DNA damage,45 possibly also playing
a role in recruiting the rest of the NER proteins and other roles
that are still unknown.46 Volker et al.
showed in mammalian cells that XPA (Rad14 homolog) is needed to recruit
XPF (Rad1 homolog).47 Under our experimental
conditions, the Δrad4 strain is more resistant
to BHA than the WT strain, which appeared to be an anomaly. This suggests
that NER processing may actually cause the formation of an intermediate
that affects the viability or that the processing of the damage by
NER may be detrimental under some circumstances.48,49 On the other hand, the Δrad14 strain shows
increased sensitivity in the presence of BHA. A possible explanation
for what seems a contradictory result is as follows: in this mutant,
NER can be initiated by Rad4, but the whole repair process cannot
be completed in the absence of Rad14 that eventually leads to a loss
of viability.50,51 This assay only measures the
ability of yeast cells to grow in the presence of phenolic compounds
and does not yield information on other consequences such as accumulation
of mutations, genomic rearrangements, and so forth. Exposure of the
same strains to BHT did not cause clear growth defects as observed
with BHA, indicating that cellular targets are not the same. This
preliminary screen using a specific subset of DNA repair null mutant
strains confirms that phenols can cause damage to DNA, and perhaps
more than one DNA repair pathway may be involved in the cellular response.

Growth Inhibition Assay Adapted for 96-Well
Microplate Format
The IC values for the different compounds
used in our studies were
determined with a cell growth inhibition assay. A 10 mL overnight
starter culture was prepared in liquid SC media inoculated with a
single colony of a strain carrying the deletion assay and grown for
a 17 h overnight incubation at 30 °C on a rotating wheel. The
cells were then counted using a hemacytometer, and aliquots of 2 ×
106 cells were placed into 1.7 mL sterile Eppendorf tubes
with varied volumes of a stock solution of the phenolic compound in
100% DMSO to obtain different concentrations of the compound to be
tested. The total amount of DMSO in the final culture was always between
1 and 3% DMSO. SC media were then added to bring the final volume
of each tube to 1 mL. We adapted the growth assay to grow cells in
a 96-well microplate in small volumes (200 μL). In a typical
growth assay, two different phenolic compounds were run at the same
time; 12 different concentrations were each tested in quadruplicates.
The 1 mL culture was then aliquoted into 96-well plates (microplate
sterile 96K U-form Greiner Bio-One, USA scientific) such that there
were four replicates for each concentration (200 μL aliquots
in each well). To prevent contamination and possibly excessive evaporation,
microtiter plates were covered with a sealing film (TempPlate sealing
film sterile, USA Scientific) and incubated at 30 °C clipped
to a rotating drum to maintain constant agitation. After 17 h, the
plate was scanned at 655 nm using a Bio-Rad microplate reader. The
average background absorbance of the solvent control samples (SC media,
DMSO) was subtracted from the average absorbance measured for each
treated sample and plotted against the log of the phenol concentrations
used. A regression was fit to the linear region of the resulting sigmoidal
curve, and the concentrations of the compound that induced 20%, 50%,
and 80% inhibition of yeast cell growth were interpolated from the
curve (IC20, IC50, and IC80 values,
respectively) (Supporting Information Table
S1 and Figure S1).

DEL Recombination Assay
The S. cerevisiae strains used for the DEL assay were
diploid strains TNX70, TNX71,
and TNX90 (Table 5)
and were constructed by crossing a haploid strain containing the his3::URA3::his3 allele
that consists of a URA3 gene disrupting the HIS3 gene. The his3 sequences on either
side lack the 3′ end and 5′ end of the HIS3 sequence, respectively, and they share 415 bp of the homologous
sequence in direct orientation such that if they recombine, it results
in a functional HIS3 allele. The other haploid strain
carries the his3-Δ200 allele
that consists of a deletion of the HIS3 open reading
frame. The his3-Δ200 and his3::URA3::his3 alleles
were kindly provided by Adam Bailis, and the latter was built as described
in Maines et al. 1998.31

To determine
the effect of different phenolic compounds on deletion formation in
yeast, the strains were first streaked and grown on SC-Ura plates
at 30 °C to isolate single colonies. Drop-out media were used
to keep under selection the his3::URA3::his3 allele to prevent spontaneous direct repeat
recombination. A single colony was transferred to 5 mL of liquid SC-Ura
media and grown on a rotator at 30 °C for 17 h. Cells were counted
and new cultures for untreated and treated samples were prepared by
inoculating with an appropriate volume of overnight culture to obtain
2 × 106 cells/mL. The control (untreated) samples
consisted of 2 × 106 cells/mL in SC-Ura media with
2% DMSO in a final volume of 2 mL. The phenol-treated samples contained
2 × 106 cells/mL, the appropriate amount of phenol
stock solution prepared in 100% DMSO that would result in a final
phenol concentration equivalent to IC20, IC50, or IC80 values (previously determined by the growth
assay), and DMSO was then added to ensure that the final concentration
of DMSO in the treated sample matched the % DMSO in the control sample
(% DMSO used never exceeded 3% of the final volume).

Cells were
then grown following the same method used for growing
cells in 96-well plates, as described in the growth assay with slight
modifications. Four 220 μL aliquots of each sample were transferred
to a 0.5 mL sterile 96-well plate and grown on a rotator for 17 h
at 30 °C. After the 17 h incubation, 200 μL from each aliquot
were pooled into a sterilized Eppendorf tube. Cells were pelleted
in a microcentrifuge and washed three times with sterile distilled
water and resuspended in sterile water. Cells were then diluted appropriately
and plated onto five SC-Ura agar plates to determine the total number
of viable cells and onto eight SC-HIS agar plates to determine the
number of His+ recombinants (DEL events). All plates were
grown at 30 °C for 3 days, and the colonies were counted. The
recombination frequency (DEL frequency) for each sample was calculated
by dividing the total number of recombinants by the total number of
viable cells. Frequencies from three different biological samples
were then averaged and presented as the deletion frequency with SD
(Supporting Information Table S2). Statistical
significance of recombination frequencies between controls and treated
samples were determined by the Student’s t test. The fold increase in deletion formation was calculated by
dividing the deletion frequencies of treated versus deletion frequencies
of untreated samples. Fold deletion formation values were then analyzed
by QSAR. The percent viability after a phenolic compound treatment
for a deletion assay was calculated by dividing the number of viable
cells (colony forming units in SC-Ura) in the treated sample by the
number of viable cells in the untreated sample (Supporting Information Table S2).

QSAR Analysis
The comparative quantitative structure–activity
relationship suite of programs (BioByte Inc., Claremont, CA) was used
to derive the various models.20,54P represents
the partition coefficients of the phenols. In this study, calculated
log P (clog P) values were utilized
to represent hydrophobicity. Sigma plus (σ+) is Brown’s
refinement of the Hammett electronic constant, sigma (σ).55 In all models, n represents
the number of data points in the study, r is the
correlation coefficient, s is the standard deviation
of the regression equation, and q2 comprises
the cross-validated r2. The 95% confidence
intervals for the terms in the equations are listed in parenthesis.
The cross-validated r2 designated by q2 is obtained by using the leave-one-out procedure.56

Pinning Assay
Single colonies were
inoculated into
liquid SC media and grown to saturation at 30 °C. One hundred
microliters of each saturated culture were aliquoted into a 96-well
plate and serially diluted (1:10, 1:100, 1:1000, and 1:10 000).
Using a 96-well floating-pin replicator, 3 μL was transferred
onto SC agar plates with 2% DMSO and IC50, or IC80 values of BHA, BHT, or no phenol as the control. The plates were
imaged after 3 days of growth at 30 °C with an LAS 500 imager
(Figure 5).
