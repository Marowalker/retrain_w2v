A series of potassium
salt-loaded MgAl hydrotalcites were synthesized
by wet impregnation of KNO3, KF, KOH, K2CO3, and KHCO3 salts over calcined MgAl hydrotalcite
(Mg–Al = 3:1). The samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction,
Fourier transform infrared, thermogravimetry–differential thermal
analysis, scanning electron microscopy, and N2 absorption–desorption
techniques to investigate their structural properties. The results
showed formation of well-developed hydrotalcite phase and reconstruction
of layered structure after impregnation. The prepared hydrotalcites
possess mesopores and micropores having pore diameters in the range
of 3.3–4.0 nm and Brunauer–Emmett–Teller surface
area 90–207 m2 g–1. Base strengths
calculated from Hammett indicator method were found increasing after
loading salts, where KOH-loaded hydrotalcite showed base strength
in the range of 12.7 < H– < 15, which was
found to be the preferred catalyst. Subsequently, KOH loading was
increased from 10 to 40% (w/w) and catalytic activity was evaluated
for the Knoevenagel condensation reaction at room temperature. Density
functional theory calculations show that among all of the oxygen atoms
present in the hydrotalcite, the O atom attached to the K atom has
the highest basic character. In this study, 10% KOH-loaded hydrotalcite
showing 99% conversion and 100% selectivity was selected as the preferred
catalyst in terms of base strength, stability, and catalytic efficiency.

1 Introduction
Design,
synthesis, and application of solid base catalysts have
been of major concern in recent years due to their tunable basicity,
environmentally acceptable nature, and capacity to catalyze diverse
reactions.1,2 Although a large number of basic materials
have been reported in the literature, the study of structure–property
relationship of supported solid bases and their basic properties has
aroused renewed interest recently.3 Host
materials like zeolites (e.g., NaY, KL, NaX), porous metal oxides
(e.g., Al2O3, ZrO2), mesoporous silica
(e.g., SBA-15, MCM-41), mixed metal oxides, montmorillonite clay,
ALPO series, etc. are employed to prepare solid strong bases and super
bases.4,5 Among various guest materials and alkali
and alkaline earth metal salts, transition metals like Ag, Cu, Co,
etc. are the most common.6,7 Among various alkali
metal salts, potassium salt-loaded catalysts, e.g., KNO3/Al2O3, KNO3/ZrO2, KF/NaY,
K2CO3/Y zeolite, KOH/NaX, KOH/Al2O3, KOH/ZrO2, KOH/MgO, etc., have been reported
as excellent basic materials for a good number of organic reactions.8−10 On the other hand, oxide hosts due to their low surface area and
silicon-containing hosts due to reaction with some basic guests have
limited their use for many reactions.11 Hydrotalcites (HTs) and hydrotalcite-like layered materials are
another class of solid hosts that are used to generate strong bases.12 This is a class of solid superbase that can
catalyze a large number of organic reactions, such as transesterification,
aldol condensation, Knoevenagel condensation, isomerization, and epoxidation
reaction.13,14 However, selection of metal salts to suit
the host material and their effect over structure and basicity of
the host are yet to be explored for hydrotalcite-like compounds. Besides,
conditions for a suitable catalyst in terms of its base strength,
catalytic activity, stability of host material, recovery, etc. are
not easily met.15 Recently, Zhao et al.
have reported that potassium-loaded MgAl mixed oxides using KOH has
base strength (H–) above 26.5 and shows high catalytic
activity for the Knoevenagel condensation reaction at room temperature.16 On the basis of the aforementioned ideas, we
aimed to investigate the structure and basicity of Mg–Al hydrotalcite
after modification with a series of potassium salts.

The Knoevenagel
condensation is a versatile C–C bond-forming
reaction between a carbonyl compound and an active hydrogen compound
to form an unsaturated compound, which can lead to the formation of
various chemically and biologically important intermediates, such
as α-cyanocinnamates, α,β-unsaturated esters, α,β-unsaturated
nitriles, cinnamic acid, etc. These intermediates are commonly used
for the production of perfumes, cosmetics, drugs, antihypertensives,
calcium antagonists, polymers, fine chemicals, pharmaceuticals, etc.
Kantam et al. reported a modified method for activation of MgAl hydrotalcite
and applied them for the quantitative formation of the Knoevenagel
condensation product in liquid phase.17 In another report, Ebitani et al. showed that reconstructed hydrotalcite
is more active than untreated hydrotalcite and provides a unique acid–base
bifunctional surface capable of promoting the Knoevenagel and Michael
reactions.18 They have also found that
reconstructed hydrotalcite gives three times more yield than untreated
hydrotalcites for aldol and Knoevenagel condensation reactions. Similarly,
modified Mg–Al hydrotalcite with tert-butoxide
anion, layered double hydroxide fluoride, and hydrotalcite in ionic
liquid medium are reported as efficient catalysts for this reaction.19 Garcia et al. and Čejka et al. have recently
reviewed varieties of effective catalysts, such as cation-exchanged
zeolites,20 metal-organic frameworks,21−24 mesoporous molecular seives,25 etc.,
for the Knoevenagel condensation reaction. Other types of solids like
ZnO, MgO, alumina, potassium carbonates, zeolites, modified zeolites,
natural phosphates, etc. are reported as potential catalysts for this
reaction.26 These are considered as more
benign in comparison to traditionally used alkaline hydroxides.27

In this work, we have impregnated a series
of potassium salts,
i.e., KNO3, KF, KOH, K2CO3, and KHCO3, over calcined Mg–Al hydrotalcite (3:1 ratio), studied
the effect of base precursors on the structure and basicity of the
host, and finally employed for the Knoevenagel condensation reaction.

2 Results and Discussion
Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD)
patterns of parent hydrotalcite
and potassium salt-loaded hydrotalcites are presented in Figure 1. Reflections at
2θ values of 11.5, 23.05, 34.7, 38.35, 45.95, 60.5, and 61.75°
corresponding to (003), (006), (102), (105), (108), (110), and (113)
planes indicate the formation of highly crystalline layered structure
of hydrotalcite, which corroborates well with literature reports.28 Again all potassium salt-loaded samples show
strong peaks for (003) and (006) planes, which clearly shows the presence
of hydrotalcite phase; this confirms rehydration and reconstruction
of hydrotalcite phase after loading. However, shifting of 2θ
positions to slightly higher or lower values and diminished intensity
of loaded samples can be attributed to the presence of potassium salts
on hydrotalcite structure. It has been observed from Figure 1 that the salts KOH, KHCO3, and K2CO3 are well dispersed over
the support, whereas KF- and KNO3-loaded samples showed
some additional diffraction lines in the XRD pattern. Hence, preferred
catalyst can be chosen among KOH, KHCO3, and K2CO3 in terms of phase stability. This observation was
further investigated through crystallinity study, which did not follow
the similar trend. The crystallinity study revealed that the highest
crystallinity after loading was achieved for KOH/HT and the lowest
was for KHCO3/HT (Figure S1,
Supporting Information). It shows that although KHCO3 disperses
better than KF and KNO3 onto the host, it decreases the
crystallinity of the overall catalyst. Thus, crystallinity loss is
dependent on the nature of the salt but not on dispersion. Thus, observing
both crystallinity and phase stability, we can observe that KOH/HT
is a stable and highly crystalline catalyst among KOH, KHCO3, and K2CO3. Therefore, KOH/HT is chosen as
the preferred salt from XRD. We have also calculated crystallite sizes,
unit cell parameters (a), and basal spacing between the layers (d),
which are summarized in Table 1. Peaks for (003) and (006) reflections were considered to
calculate basal spacings between the layers. Peak for (110) reflection
was used to calculate unit cell parameter “a” according to the formula a = 2d, whereas the (003) plane was used to calculate “c” according to the formula c = 3d.29 Comparison of the original hydrotalcite
to the loaded hydrotalcites shows that the basal spacings and unit
cell parameters increase after loading. Increase of basal spacings
and unit cell parameters further supports increase of Mg (+2) ions
gradually in the LDH, indicating interaction of some Al (+3) ions
with potassium salts and decrease of Coulombic interaction between
interlayer anions and brucite-like layers.30,31 The increases of both “d” and a are larger for KOH/HT, K2CO3/HT,
and KNO3/HT (d003 = 7.80–7.93; d006 = 3.88–3.91; a =
3.06–3.07) than for KF/HT and KHCO3/HT (d003 = 7.70–7.73; d006 = 3.85–3.86; a = 3.05–3.06).

KOH/HT	11.15	7.93	22.85	3.89	60.35	1.53	3.06	23.79	82.31	
Thus,
a stability order of the salts over the support can be understood
from overall results of X-ray diffraction study, which follows the
trend KOH/HT ∼ K2CO3/HT > KHCO3/HT > KF/HT ∼ KNO3/HT. Hence, among the
studied
salts over hydrotalcite support, KOH is chosen as the preferred salt.
Smaller crystallite size of KOH/HT in comparison to the others is
again in favor of its selection as preferred catalyst for base-catalyzed
reaction.32 Following these results, we
have loaded KOH amount of 15–40% (w/w) by identical impregnation
method to gain better understanding of the effect of the salt over
the support.

Figure 1 shows that
hydrotalcite layered structure preserves up to 20% loading of KOH
and collapses above it, where the reflection for the (003) plane was
completely destroyed for 25–40% loaded samples. However, crystallinity
loss was quite higher for 15–40% loaded samples. When 15% KOH
was loaded, crystallinity loss was increased 7 times more in comparison
to 10% loaded sample. Therefore, KOH loading beyond 10% is believed
to be not effective over hydrotalcite support. Hence, 10% KOH/HT has
been conceded as the best catalyst in this study.

The thermogravimetric
analysis (TGA) and differential thermal analysis
(DTA) results obtained from thermal analysis of uncalcined samples
in the temperature range of 20–500 °C shows four decomposition
steps, which are typical for hydrotalcite-like compounds (Figure S2, Supporting Information). The first
weight loss step in the temperature range 20–90 °C corresponds
to the loss of physically adsorbed water on the surface, which is
found to be in the range of 1–12% of the total weight loss
(Table S1, Supporting Information). In
the second step, 12–15% weight loss takes place in the range
of 80–250 °C due to the loss of interlayer water molecules.
We have observed that the weight loss steps of all loaded samples
are similar to the parent hydrotalcite, except the step for interlayer
water loss. For HT, KF/HT, and KNO3/HT, interlayer water
loss takes place only in a single step, whereas it takes place in
several steps for KOH/HT, KHCO3/HT, and K2CO3/HT. This shows that the water molecules may be linked in
different environments in the presence of different guest molecules.
In the third step i.e., 250–415 °C, dehydroxylation and
partial loss of carbon dioxide take place, showing 13–22% weight
loss. It is noteworthy that dehydroxylation becomes slower after loading
of the salts and collapse of the brucite layers starts at low temperature
in comparison to the parent hydrotalcite. Besides, dehydroxylation
is the fastest in case of KNO3/HT and the slowest in case
of KOH/HT, which in turn confirms that the HT phase is thermally less
stable in the presence of KNO3 salt and more stable in
the presence of KOH. In the fourth weight loss step, loss of carbon
dioxide from the samples takes place in the temperature range of 395–518
°C, showing a weight loss of 2–4%. Thus, TGA analysis
reveals that the hydrotalcite layer collapses earlier for KNO3/HT and KF/HT in comparison to the other three, i.e., KOH/HT,
KHCO3/HT, and K2CO3/HT, which gives
thermal stability order of the loaded salts as KNO3/HT
< KF/HT < KHCO3/HT < K2CO3/HT < KOH/HT. Thus, TGA analysis also reveals that KOH/HT is the
most thermally stable catalyst and the preferred catalyst in our study.

The Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra of prepared hydrotalcites
are presented in Figure 2. Characteristic bands for hydrotalcite at around 3450, 1640, 1380,
860, 661, and 510 cm–1 clearly indicate the presence
of interlayer water molecules, hydroxyl groups in the brucite-like
layers, carbonate ions in the interlayer galleries, and Mg–O
and Al–O bonds in all samples. Again, bands at around 3600–2800
cm–1 for KOH/HT, K2CO3/HT,
and KHCO3/HT samples are broader compared to KNO3/HT and KF/HT, which may be due to the high water content of these
samples in the surface as well as in the interlayer spaces. This again
correlates well with thermogravimetric analysis of the samples, confirming
high water content of these samples in the interlayer spaces.

Figure 2 FTIR patterns
of hydrotalcites loaded with potassium salts.

Nitrogen adsorption–desorption measurements were carried
out to investigate the surface areas, pore sizes, and pore volumes
of the materials. Table 2 shows textural properties of the parent hydrotalcite and potassium
salt-loaded hydrotalcites. The parent hydrotalcite exhibits a Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) surface area of 207 m2 g–1. Introduction
of potassium species decreases the BET surface area of all of the
samples. The surface area of hydrotalcite loaded with K2CO3 is lost to a greater extent compared to the other
four salts and decreases up to 90 m2 g–1. This is due to the blockage of pores and interlayer spaces of hydrotalcite
by CO32– anions of K2CO3 salt, thus preventing N2 molecules to adsorb onto
the surface. This observation has been further confirmed by the pore
volume calculation of the samples, which shows that the pore volume
of K2CO3/HT is the smallest and decreases from
0.23 cm3 g–1 of parent hydrotalcite to
0.19 cm3 g–1 of the loaded one. On the
other hand, surface areas of KNO3/HT and KF/HT are 201
and 197 m2 g–1, respectively. This can
be expected for low water content of these materials, as described
in TGA and DTA analysis. We have found intermediate values of surface
areas for the samples KOH/HT and KHCO3/HT. This can be
attributed to the high water content in these samples. On the other
hand, the KOH/HT sample shows the largest pore volume and pore diameter
with comparable surface area to the parent hydrotalcite. Thus, surface
areas and pore sizes of loaded hydrotalcites other than K2CO3 salt are not abruptly affected after loading the salts.
The N2 adsorption–desorption measurements showed
that all hydrotalcites exhibit type II isotherm and H3 hysteresis
loop characteristics of both monolayer and multilayer adsorption typical
for aggregated powders like clays or cements having no uniform pore
structures (Figure S3, Supporting Information).33,34 Type H3 hysteresis loops are generally found for nonrigid aggregates
of platelike particles or assemblages of slit-shaped pores in the
sample. It has again been confirmed from the pore size distribution
curves of the samples, which show broad range of pore sizes in the
samples. However, narrow pore size distribution centered at a pore
radius of 20 Å and large pore volume of KOH/HT has led us to
select it as the optimum sample in this study.

The scanning electron microscopy
(SEM) images of parent hydrotalcite
and KOH/HT in magnification of X5500 and X4000 are shown in Figure 3. The parent hydrotalcite
has crystal sizes in nanometer ranges with homogeneous shapes of the
crystals. On loading KOH onto it, particle size decreases, showing
layers of agglomerated sheets in the range of 1–2 μm.

The results of base strengths of all hydrotalcites, which
were
determined by the Hammett indicator method, are summarized in Table 2. Hydrotalcites loaded
with KF, K2CO3, KNO3, and KOH after
drying at 80 °C for 15 h showed color change in the presence
of Tropaeolin O (H– = 11.1–12.7)
indicator and could not change the color of 2,4-dinitroaniline (H– = 15). Therefore, they showed similar
base strength in the range of 12.7 < H– < 15. On the other hand, the unloaded parent hydrotalcite
and KHCO3/HT showed color change with phenolphthalein (H– = 8.0–9.6), whereas no change
was observed with Tropaeolin O (H– =
11.1–12.7). Thus, their base strengths lie in the range of
9.6 < H– < 11.1. Total basicity
measurement of the samples shows that the number of total basic sites
for K2CO3/HT and KOH/HT are higher than the
other samples. This is reflected in the catalytic activities shown
in Table 4 that the
conversions for KOH/HT and K2CO3/HT are higher
than the other catalysts. On the other hand, the total number of basic
sites of all of the catalysts is relatively low compared to calcined
hydrotalcites reported in the literature. However, it is quite obvious
from the results that although the number of total basic sites is
not quite high, uncalcined hydrotalcites also can fairly catalyze
the Knoevenagel condensation reaction with its moderate base strengths.
Thus, loading of alkali metal compounds over hydrotalcites would be
acknowledged to catalyze some mild base-catalyzed organic reactions,
such as the Knoevenagel condensation reaction, nitroaldol condensation
reaction, aldol condensation, etc. Soluble basicities of all of the
samples are low, where no soluble base was found at all for KNO3/HT. This again indicates more interaction of KNO3 with host hydrotalcite structure, thus preventing their loss as
soluble base.

We again calculated the reactivity of the O atoms
using density
functional-based reactivity descriptor, the Fukui function. Fukui
functions, fO+ and fO–, are evaluated using Hirshfeld
population analysis (HPA) and Mulliken population analysis (MPA) schemes
to locate the nucleophilic and electrophilic sites, respectively.
Although an analytical expression for the Fukui function is not available,
it is usually calculated by finite difference approximation, which
is called the condensed Fukui function. The condensed Fukui function
of an atom “O” in a molecule with N electrons at constant
external potential v(r⃗)
can be expressed as 1a   1b  where ρO(No), ρO(No + ΔN), and ρO(No + ΔN) are
charge densities on
atom O of the system with No, No + ΔN, and No – ΔN electron systems,
respectively. In conventional Fukui function computations, a value
of 1.0 is used for ΔN. In the present calculation,
we have used a value of 0.1 for ΔN. The values
of Fukui functions are given in Table 3. We have calculated the Fukui functions (fO+ and fO–), relative electrophilicity (fO+/fO–), and relative
nucleophilicity (fO–/fO+) for those oxygen atoms in the
hydrotalcite system having higher values of these reactivity parameters.
In general, it is observed that for a particular atom in a molecule,
the increase in fO– values is the indication of high basicity.
From Table 3, it has
been seen that the highest fO– value is obtained for
the oxygen atom number 38, which is the one attached to the potassium
atom. Relative electrophilicity (fO+/fO–) and relative
nucleophilicity (fO–/fO+) are better reactivity parameters
to locate the preferable site for nucleophilic and electrophilic attacks,
respectively, in a chemical system.35,36 The basicity
of a system increases with the increase of the fO–/fO+ ratio. Thus, the oxygen attached to the potassium having the highest
value of relative nucleophilicity (fO–/fO+) will be the most basic site. From this calculation, we have inferred
that the O atom attached to the K atom has highest values of fO– as well as fO–/fO+. Therefore, we can conclude that
O 38 is the most basic site in the hydrotalcite system. The optimized
structure of the hydrotalcite is shown in Figure 4. The oxygen atoms for which the reactivity
parameters have been evaluated are marked, and these are the atoms
having higher basic character in the system.

The catalytic activities
of the parent and potassium salt-loaded
hydrotalcites were evaluated for liquid-phase Knoevenagel condensation
reaction (Scheme 1)
at room temperature with a variety of aldehydes. The conversion of
reactants to the products in an organic reaction is mainly influenced
by parameters such as solvent, temperature, effect of substituted
groups in the substrates, amount of catalysts, etc. Taking these points
into consideration, we have optimized the reaction conditions by varying
the conditions. First, the reaction was performed at room temperature without any catalyst by
taking malononitrile and p-nitrobenzaldehyde as model
reactants and methanol as solvent. To our expectation, no formation
of the product was observed. Therefore, we have performed all other
reactions in the presence of catalysts, i.e., with modified hydrotalcites
and rehydrated hydrotalcite under the same reaction conditions. The
results are summarized in Table 4. Reaction with rehydrated hydrotalcite
is comparatively slower than with the loaded hydrotalcite (Table 4, entry 2). It has
been observed that the reaction in methanol is not selective with
all of the catalysts and conversions are lower than reported methods.
However, KNO3/HT and KF/HT (Table 4, entries 3 and 4) catalysts show better
results than the other catalysts in terms of selectivity and it can
be correlated to their larger surface areas than the other loaded
catalysts. This can be correlated again from TGA results described
above that due to low water content in KNO3/HT and KF/HT,
aprotic environment of the catalyst makes the aldol-type intermediate
dehydrate easily, thus showing better selectivity of the Knoevenagel
product compared to KOH/HT, KHCO3/HT, and K2CO3/HT (Table 4, entries 5–7), where more interlayer water content
of these catalysts offers protic environment in the catalysts, thus
stabilizing the intermediate aldol-type product before the dehydration
step. However, low conversions of the product with KNO3/HT and KF/HT catalysts can be attributed to the interaction of the
salts with the support forming new phases and thus reducing active
sites of the catalysts (XRD). On the other hand, the preferred catalyst
of this study, i.e., KOH/HT (Table 4, entry 7), showed the highest conversion, largest
pore volume, longest pore diameter, and good selectivity within 30
min and therefore the reaction was further carried out with this catalyst
to optimize the reaction conditions. High conversion of KOH/HT is
also supported by its small crystallite sizes (Table 1), which favors the active hydroxyl groups
to take part in the reaction.37

Following this study,
we have investigated the effect of solvents
with 10% KOH/HT at room temperature by taking six different solvents
of different polarities. It is observed that solvents play a significant
role on both conversions and selectivities. When aprotic polar solvents
were used (Table 5,
entries 2, 4, and 5), 81–99% conversion was observed giving
100% selectivity of the product within 15 min. On the other hand,
when protic polar solvent methanol was used, the reaction was slow
and both conversion and selectivity was poor (Table 5, entry 3). Nonpolar solvents like toluene
and diethyl ether (entries 1 and 6) take longer reaction time than
polar solvents, giving 61–99% conversion and 100% selectivities
within hours. It is noteworthy to mention that in this study dimethylformamide
(DMF) is superior to the most commonly used solvent toluene for the
Knoevenagel condensation reaction in the presence of hydrotalcite
catalysts. It can be attributed to the fact that the reactants are
miscible well in polar environment and the catalyst mixes homogeneously
in the reaction mixture during vigorous stirring condition. Thus,
interaction of the catalyst with reactants becomes feasible in DMF
compared to nonpolar solvents toluene or diethyl ether. Therefore,
it is clear from Table 5 that DMF is the best choice in terms of conversion, selectivity,
and reaction time, and 10% KOH/HT can be chosen as the optimum catalyst
with DMF.

We next used 10% KOH/HT for the Knoevenagel condensation
reaction
with various aldehydes bearing electron-donating and electron-withdrawing
groups, active methylene compounds (malononitrile and diethyl malonate),
and DMF at room temperature. The results are summarized in Table 6. The Knoevenagel
condensation reaction has been reported previously with hydrotalcite-like
catalysts, such as rehydrated Mg–Al hydrotalcite and metal-loaded
Mg–Al hydrotalcite in different reaction media and optimized
reaction conditions.38 At this time, rehydration
and loading have been done in the same step and found an efficient
catalyst for this reaction. Aldehydes with both electron-donating
and electron-withdrawing groups reacted efficiently with malononitrile
under similar reaction condition to give 99% conversions and 100%
selectivity of the corresponding olefins (entries 5 and 7). Aldehydes
containing electron-withdrawing groups in ortho and para positions
do not have much effect over the reaction time (Table 6, entries 2 and 5) and reacted faster than
aldehydes bearing electron-donating groups (entries 7 and 8). On the
other hand, unloaded catalyst takes comparatively longer reaction
time than loaded catalysts and gives 99% conversion and 100% selectivity
within 1.5 h (Table 6, entry 3). It may be due to the presence of potassium salts and
improved basicity of the loaded catalysts, thus completing the reaction
within short time. Heterocyclic aldehyde, i.e., 2-furaldehyde, also
reacted faster, giving 99% conversion within 15 min. However, reactions
with aliphatic aldehydes and aldehydes with big molecular size are
comparatively slower than simple aldehydes showing moderate yield
(52–65%, entries 12–13) within 5 h. With diethyl malonate
as active methylene compound, the acidity of the acidic protons decreases
due to two ester groups, thereby increasing the reaction time for
all substrates and giving 70–90% conversion and 100% selectivity
within 4–8 h. Polycyclic aromatic aldehydes, such as 1-naphthaldehyde,
also reacted efficiently, giving high conversion to the product. It
is observed that uncalcined KOH/HT with base strength in the range
of 12.7 < H– < 15 shows comparable
results to calcined mixed oxide catalyst, i.e., 21 wt % MgO–ZrO239 and 10.3 wt % K–MgAl(O),40 having base strength 26.5 ≤ H– < 33.0 (Table 6, footnotes c and d). This can be understood
as high BET surface area of KOH/HT compared to other two made the
reaction comparable to each other. We have also evaluated the efficiency
of the catalyst by performing the reaction between malononitrile and
4-chlorobenzaldehyde for four repetitive cycles. It is observed that
the catalyst is active even at the fourth cycle of the reaction, which
gives 99% conversion and 100% selectivity within 15 min (Table 6, entry 20). On the
whole, potassium hydroxide-loaded MgAl hydrotalcite acts as an efficient
solid base catalyst for the Knoevenagel condensation reaction at room
temperature.

Following this, the leaching of
potassium species into solution
was tested by flame photometry study. For this purpose, the reaction
was performed with 2 mmol p-nitobenzaldehyde, 2 mmol
malononitrile, and 100 mg of 10% KOH/HT in DCM solvent. After completion
of the reaction, 10 mL of water was added to dissolve the leached
out potassium and to separate organic portion. We observed that 0.355
mg of K was leached out from 100 mg of catalyst, which is quite low
compared to the loading amount. Thus, leaching of a small amount of
potassium does not affect the overall reaction speed and conversion.

3 Conclusions
In conclusion, we have found that KOH-loaded
MgAl hydrotalcite
prepared through wet impregnation of potassium salts over calcined
MgAl hydrotalcite is the most stable while KNO3-loaded
hydrotalcite is the least stable among a variety of potassium salt-loaded
MgAl hydrotalcites, i.e., KF, KOH, KNO3, KHCO3, and K2CO3. It was found that 10% (w/w) KOH/HT
is the best catalyst and DMF is the best solvent in the study and
catalyzes the reaction efficiently giving 99% conversion and 100%
selectivity within 10 min. It is also concluded that polar aprotic
solvents like DMF and acetonitrile speed up the reaction, whereas
nonpolar solvents slower the reaction.

4 Experimental
Section
4.1 Preparation of MgAl Hydrotalcite and MgAl(O)
Mixed Oxide
Magnesium aluminum carbonate (MgAl-CO3) hydrotalcite was prepared according to the procedure reported by
Nyambo et al.41 In this method, solution
A containing 38.46 g of Mg(NO3)2·6H2O (0.15 mol) and 18.75 g of Al(NO3)2·9H2O (0.05 mol) in 125 mL of deionized water was
added dropwise over 1 h to solution B containing 14 g of NaOH (0.35
mol) and 15.9 g of Na2CO3 (0.1 mol) in 145 mL
of deionized water at pH 10–12 with vigorous stirring. The
solution was kept stirring vigorously for another 1 h and the white
precipitate formed was aged without stirring for 24 h at 65 °C,
cooled to room temperature, filtered, and washed several times with
deionized water until the filtrate becomes neutral. Finally, the precipitate
was dried at 80 °C for 15 h and then calcined at 450 °C
for 6 h to obtain MgAl(O) support.

4.2 Preparation
of Potassium Salt-Loaded MgAl
Hydrotalcites
The potassium salt-modified hydrotalcites (HTs)
containing same amount of potassium ions (8% w/w) were prepared by
a wet impregnation method reported earlier. In this method, a solution
of the metal salt containing 1 mmol of the salt (except for K2CO3, where 0.5 mmol was taken) in 8 mL of deionized
water was stirred with 500 mg of calcined hydrotalcite for 24 h and
the slurries were dried at 80 °C for 15 h to obtain the loaded
catalysts. The samples were denoted as KNO3/HT, KOH/HT,
K2CO3/HT, KHCO3/HT, and KF/HT. Following
the same procedure, 10–40% KOH/HT was prepared by taking appropriate
quantity of KOH and the support.

4.3 Theoretical
Calculations
For the
theoretical part, density functional calculations were performed using
DMol3 program package,42 as implemented
in the Materials Studio program system.43 Geometry optimization was done by treating the exchange–correlation
interaction with generalized gradient approximation (GGA) using the
Perdew, Burke, and Ernzerhof (PBE) functional.44 We used the double numerical with polarization1 basis set for our calculations. The PBE functional
was demonstrated to be reliable for predicting structures of inorganic
oxides and it is one of the most universally applied GGA functionals.45

4.4 Characterization
Powder X-ray diffraction
patterns were recorded on a Rigaku (MiniFlex, U.K.) X-ray diffractometer
with Cu Kα radiation (1.5418 Å) at a scan speed of 7°
min–1 and 2θ range of 5–70° at
30 kV and 15 mA. The percentage crystallinities of the samples were
determined by integrating XRD peaks and using the formula, % crystallinity
= (AS × 100)/AR, where AR is the integrated area
of the reference material under the peaks between a set of 2θ
limits and AS is the integrated area of
the sample under the peaks between the same set of 2θ limits
as that of the reference. The crystallite sizes were determined by
X-ray line broadening method considering 003 reflection plane and
using the Debye–Scherrer equation (t = 0.89/β cos θ,
where “t” is the crystallite size,
“β” is the full width at half-maximum, and “θ”
is the angle of diffraction).37 FTIR spectra
of various catalysts were recorded on a Nicolet Impact model-410 spectrometer
with 1 cm–1 resolution and 32 scans in the mid-IR
(400–4000 cm–1) region using the KBr pellet
technique. The SEM measurements were carried out using a JEOL JSM-6390LV
scanning electron microscope. Thermogravimetric analysis was performed
using a Shimadzu thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA-50) in the temperature
range of 25–600 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C min–1, and differential scanning calorimetric analysis
was performed using a Shimadzu differential scanning calorimeter (DSC-60)
in the temperature range of 25–300 °C at a heating rate
of 10 °C min–1. Both analyses were performed
under nitrogen atmosphere using 10–15 mg of sample. The specific
surface areas were determined from N2 adsorption–desorption
isotherms obtained by the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller method
using a Quantachrome NOVA 1000e surface area and pore size analyzer
at −196 °C. Pore size distributions were calculated using
the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda equation from the amount
desorbed at a relative pressure of about 0.05–1 using N2 desorption branches of the isotherm. Flame photometry analysis
was performed in Systronics Flame Photometer 128.

The strengths
of basic sites were determined by the Hammett indicator method, following
the procedure reported by Fraile et al.46 The following Hammett indicators were used: neutral red (H– = 6.8–8.0), phenolphthalein (H– = 8.0–9.6), Tropaeolin O (H– = 11.1–12.7), and 2,4-dinitroaniline
(H– = 15). In this procedure, 25 mg
of loaded catalyst was shaken with 1 mL of indicator solution (0.1%
in methanol) and allowed to equilibrate for 2 h. The color of the
catalyst was then noted. The base strength was reported as stronger
than the weakest indicator, which exhibits a color change, and weaker
than the strongest indicator, which exhibits no color change.47 Total basicities of the samples were determined
by titration with benzoic acid. In this method, a suspension of the
loaded hydrotalcite (0.15 g) in a toluene solution of phenolphthalein
(2 mL, 0.1 mg mL–1) was stirred for 30 min and titrated
with a toluene solution of benzoic acid (0.01 M). To determine the
leachable basicities, 100 mg of loaded hydrotalcite was added to 10
mL water and the mixture was shaken well at room temperature for 1
h. The catalyst was filtered off, and a methanol solution of phenolphthalein
(1 mL, 0.1 mg mL–1) was added to the filtrate, which
was then titrated with a methanol solution of benzoic acid (0.01 M).

4.5 Catalytic Reactions
The Knoevenagel
condensation reaction was carried out in a 50 mL round-bottom flask
at room temperature. The catalysts were oven-dried at 80 °C for
12 h prior to use. In the typical procedure, 0.025 g of catalyst was
added to a mixture of 1 mmol aldehyde, 1 mmol active methylene compound,
and 3 mL of DMF at room temperature. The whole mixture was stirred
for the required time and monitored by thin-layer chromatography.
After completion of the reaction, DMF was evaporated and the product
was extracted with ethyl acetate, dried over anhydrous Na2SO4, evaporated, purified, and finally analyzed using
a 1H NMR spectrometer (JEOL JNM-ECS 400) taking Me4Si as the internal standard and CDCl3 as solvent.
The used catalysts were washed several times with acetone, dried,
and then reused. The conversions (%) were determined from integration
of 1H NMR signal of the crude reaction mixtures.
