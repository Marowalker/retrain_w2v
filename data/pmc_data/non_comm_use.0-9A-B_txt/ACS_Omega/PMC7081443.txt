Zirconia has become an excellent
choice of dental implants because
of its excellent mechanical strength, aesthetic, and biocompatibility.
Although some studies have shown ultraviolet (UV) irradiation is effective
to photofunctionalize dental zirconia that can improve osteoblastic
function, the scattered information has not identified the most effective
exposure time and wavelength of UV. Herein, this study has investigated
the effects of UV irradiation on zirconia after UV-A (365 nm) or UV-C
(243 nm) photofunctionalization for different times (15 min, 3 and
24 h). After irradiation, the zirconia surface was analyzed by color
spectrophotometry, scanned electron microscopy (SEM), energy-dispersive
X-ray spectrometry, water contact angle (WCA) with goniometer, and
X-ray diffraction. Osteoblastic (MC3T3-E1) cells were cultured on
zirconia discs and evaluated with a CCK-8 test kit for cell proliferation
(3 h and 1 day) and with alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity (14 days).
Significant color change (ΔE) was observed
by irradiating with UV-C for 15 min (1.99), 3 h (1.92), and 24 h (3.35),
whereas only minute changes were observed with UV-A (respectively,
ΔE: 0.18, 0.14, 0.57). No surface textural
changes were observed nor a monoclinic phase was detected on both
the UV-A and UV-C irradiated samples. UV-C significantly decreased
the C/Zr ratios and WCA, with irradiating for 24 h presenting the
lowest values, and it was the only condition to give significantly
higher ALP activity at 14 days (p < 0.05) and
CCK-8 values for 1 day culture (p < 0.05). It
is concluded that UV-C (but not UV-A) irradiation can significantly
change the aesthetic in color, and only prolonged 24 h UV-C irradiation
can enhance MC3T3-E1 cell adhesion on zirconia by photofunctionalization.

==== Body
Introduction
Zirconia is a crystalline oxide form of
zirconium which can present
in three phases: (1) monoclinic phase, (2) tetragonal phase, and (3)
cubic phase. The tetragonal phase is stable between the temperatures
of 1170–2370 °C with suitable mechanical properties that
are desirable for biomedical use.1,2 In order to
obtain tetragonal zirconia polycrystals (TZP) at room temperature,
commonly 3 mol % yttria is added3 in dental
zirconia and these TZP have shown outstanding performance in terms
of mechanics, biocompatibility, and aesthetics.4,5 Because
of its qualities of excellent mechanical performance, strength, and
fracture resistance,6 TZP may be a potential
alternative to titanium (Ti) as an implant material. The osseointegration
capability and durability of TZP implants has been reported to be
similar to that of Ti implants.7,8

Initial attachment,
proliferation, and differentiation of osteoblasts
at the implant–bone interface play an important role in the
early stages of osseointegration.6 Surface
characteristics are very essential in the early stages of osseointegration,
such that the process of protein adsorption, initial attachment, proliferation,
and differentiation of osteoblasts would be influenced at the implant–bone
interface.9−11 Various in vitro studies reported
that adsorption characteristics of cell attachment can be affected
by surface wettability. High surface wettability is generally recognized
to promote more cell attachment than low surface wettability.12−14 In fact, a smaller static water contact angle (WCA) indicates higher
wettability, whereas a previous study15 has shown that a smaller WCA would yield higher cell attachment
of human gingival fibroblasts on different dental implant abutment
materials. The effect has not been diminished; even the average-arithmetic
roughness (Ra) was less than 0.2 μm.15 This said, static WCA is an important parameter
to estimate cell adhesion on materials.

Ultraviolet (UV) radiation
wavelength (100–400 nm) is classified
as UV-A (320–400 nm), UVB (290–320 nm), and UV-C (100–290
nm) according to the dermal biological actions of UV radiation.16 Photochemical modification (a.k.a. photofunctionalization)
by UV irradiation was reported for zirconia implant materials. Machined
zirconia surfaces after UV photofunctionalization would increase surface
hydrophilicity and enhance the initial attachment of osteoblast cell,
and this process was sometimes claimed as “bioactivation”.13,17 Hence, UV-induced bioactivation might represent a promising method
to improve surface chemistry of zirconia-based implant materials.18

Previous studies demonstrated that UV
photofunctionalization at
the mixed-wavelength of 360 and 250 nm for as little as 15 min can
accelerate healing and increase bone-to-implant contact,19 although the shortest irradiation time may be
as short as 10 min.17 Some other studies
set the time of UV light irradiation to be 2 h at the intensity of
19 mW cm–2,6 and even mixing two UV wavelengths at 0.05 mW cm–2 in intensity (360 nm in wavelength) and 2 mW cm–2 in intensity (250 nm in wavelength) to photofunctionalize
the zirconia surface.23 At present, most
of the investigations concerning the impact of photofunctionalization
on wettability and osseointegration of zirconia have achieved satisfying
results. However, UV lights can change the aesthetics of zirconia,
such that light yellow color was observed on zirconia surfaces after
UV-C irradiation.24 Furthermore, no study
has been conducted to correlate the most effective exposure time (such
as a prolonged exposure) and wavelength of UV light. Therefore, studies
are needed to solve these problems and identify the most effective
approach for zirconia osseointegration.16

This study had two objectives: the first was to analyze the
surface
characteristic of zirconia after dynamic UV-A and UV-C irradiation.
The second was to compare the dynamic osteoblast attachment and proliferation
behavior on the zirconia surface. The hypothesis of the study was
that the surface characteristic of zirconia will not be changed after
dynamic UV-A and UV-C irradiation. Furthermore, the osteoblast attachment
and proliferation behavior on the zirconia surface will be the same
with different UV treatments. We expect to discover the proper UV
irradiation wavelength and time, thus achieving relevant possibilities
for zirconia implants for improved osseointegration.

Materials and
Methods
Zirconia Disks Preparation
Zirconia disks from Wieland
(Zenostar T0, Ivoclar Vivadent, Jagst, Germany) were used in this
study. The composition of the Zenostar T0 was ZrO2, HfO2, Y2O3, Al2O3,
and other oxides. The percentage of Y2O3 was
between 4.5 and 6 wt % (2.6–3.5 mol %). The zirconia blocks
were cut into square-shaped specimen (∼9.0 × 9.0 ×
1.0 mm3) using a precision saw (IsoMet 5000, Buehler, Lake
Bluff, Illinois, USA) with a diamond blade. The samples were polished
with 1000-grit SiC abrasive paper before sintering according to the
manufacturer instructions. Then, all fully-sintered zirconia specimens
were ultrasonically cleansed in 70% ethanol solution and de-ionized
water for 15 min and dried in clean ambient air. The polished specimens
without any further modification were used as control.

UV Photofunctionalization
The zirconia samples were
randomly divided into three study groups and treated with one of the
following surface modification protocols (Table 1). UV-A irradiation (UV fluorescence cabinet
CL 150, SPECTROLINE, Westbury, New York, USA) was 365 nm in wavelength
and 550 μW cm–2 in intensity, whereas UV-C
irradiation (UV fluorescence cabinet CL 150, SPECTROLINE, Westbury,
New York, USA) was 243 nm in wavelength and 490 μW cm–2 in intensity. After UV treatment, the zirconia samples were immediately
subjected to the following experimental evaluations.

Surface Characteristics of Zirconia Surface
Color
Change
The colors of zirconia surfaces before
and after UV treatment in different groups were assessed by a color
spectrophotometer (NR10QC, 3 nh, Shenzhen, China) at three different
positions on three independent samples. The color change value (ΔE) L*a*b* was calculated according to the following formula 1  where L* stands for lightness, a* for green-red (−a = green; +a = red), b* for blue-yellow (−b = blue; +b = yellow).

Scanning Electron Microscopy and Energy Dispersive
X-ray Spectrometry
A scanning electron microscope (SU1510,
HITACHI, Ibaraki, Japan)
was used to observe the surface morphology of zirconia surfaces before
and after UV irradiation. The samples were gold sputtered for 45 s
before observation and three images were randomly taken for each sample.
The magnification was at 1000×. Three scanning electron microscopy
(SEM) images were obtained from three independent samples, and that
were further accessed by two independent viewers. For elemental compositions,
on the three zirconia specimen for each group, carbon and zirconium
on the zirconia surface were analyzed by energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry
(EDX) three times in different areas.

Water Contact Angle
Static contact angle was determined
using the sessile drop method (optical contact angle and interface
tension meter, SL200KB, KINO Industry, Boston, Massachusetts USA).
Ultrapure type 1 water was used as probe liquid. The syringe needle
was positioned 5 mm above the zirconia surface and a drop of the test
liquid (1 μL) was dispensed. Photographs were taken after droplets
impacted on the zirconia surface and were in equilibrium situation
for 20 s, using the built-in software (CAST3.0; KINO, Norcross, GA,
USA). Three zirconia specimens of each group were tested, and the
contact angles for each specimen were measured and calculated from
three drops of the liquid droplets. Each test was repeated three times.

X-Ray Diffraction Analysis
X-ray diffraction (XRD)
(Rigaku SmartLab, Tokyo, Japan) examination was used to analyze the
changes of surface crystalline structure on three specimens for each
group. The scanning was carried out within the 2θ range between
20 and 80° at a speed of 4°/min with a voltage of 45 kV
and a current of 200 mA. The result was analyzed by the software Jade
6.5 (Materials Data, Inc., Livermore, California, USA).

Biological
Study
Osteoblastic Cell Culture
Murine pre-osteoblastic MC3T3-E1
cells (ATCC, Manassas, Virginia, USA) in passage number of P20 to
P50 were grown in alpha-modified Eagle’s medium (α-MEM)
(Gibco, Carlsbad, California, USA) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal
bovine serum (Hyclone, Logan, Utah, USA) and 1% (v/v) penicillin/streptomycin
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, California, USA). The cells were cultured at
37 °C with 5% CO2 in the humidified incubator. At
80% confluency, MC3T3-E1 cells were trypsinized and seeded onto zirconia
specimens of the seven independent test groups (shown in Table 1) for respective time-points
of 3 h (n = 3) and 1 day (n = 3)
at a density of 8 × 104 cells/well in a 24-well plate.

Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) Test
Initial attachment
of cells was evaluated by measuring the quantity of the cells attached
to zirconia substrates for each group after 3 h and 1 day incubation.
These quantifications were performed using Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8,
Model: CK04, Dojindo Molecular Technologies, Tokyo, Japan). In brief,
the original cell culture medium in each well was discarded at certain
time points, 300 μL of CCK-8 solution was then added, immersing
the zirconia samples, and incubating with the samples for 3 h. Absorbance
of the supernatant was measured at 450 nm by a SpectraMax M2 microplate
reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, California, USA). There were
three replicates for each group.

Alkaline Phosphatase Activity
MC3T3-E1 cells were first
seeded in 24-well plates at a density of 8 × 104 cells/well
in standard medium (the same medium as described in the Osteoblastic Cell Culture section). For osteogenic
differentiation, an osteogenic medium that contains 50 μg/mL
L-ascorbic acid (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Missouri, USA) and 10 mmol/L
β-glycerophosphate (Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented in α-MEM
was used. For each group, three zirconia specimens were used. One
zirconia specimen was put into each well and cultured for 14 days.
The medium was changed every 3 days. At day 14, the cells were lysed
by Triton X-100 (Anaspec Inc., Fremont, California, USA). Then, the
cell differentiation was determined by measuring the level of Alkaline
Phosphatase (ALP) activity using the ALP Assay Kit (Nanjing Jiancheng
Bioengineering Institute, Nanjing, China). The solution would show
a yellow-colored product, and the absorbance was measured at 405 nm
by a SpectraMax M2 microplate reader. ALP activity was normalized
to the protein concentration of cellular lysates.

Statistical
Analyses
The data were analyzed by Statistical
Package for Social Science (SPSS, Version 23, IBM, Armonk, New York,
USA). The statistical analysis was performed using one-way analysis
of variance (ANOVA) at a significance level (α) of 5%, that
is, p < 0.05 was considered to be statistically
significant.

Results
Color Change
The
color change values (ΔE) L*a*b* after UV-A irradiation for
15 min, 3 and 24 h were, respectively,
0.18, 0.14, and 0.57. The color change which was not visually observable
was detected on UV-A irradiation. The values of ΔE after UV-C irradiation for 15 min, 3 h, 24 h were, respectively,
1.99, 1.92, and 3.35, such that the color changes from white to light
yellow were visually observable (Figure 1).

morphology in all groups after different UV treatments, such that
small pits and shallow grooves from the polishing procedures could
be seen. EDX results (Table 2) show that the C/Zr ratio decreased significantly after UV-C
irradiation for different time of 15 min (0.33), 3 h (0.35), and 24
h (0.37) compared to the control group (0.45) (p <
0.05). However, no significant difference of the C/Zr ratio was found
between UV-A irradiated samples and the control group.

(70.7°) (p < 0.05). Upon UV-A irradiation,
there was a slight decrease compared to the control group (p < 0.05); WCA values, respectively, were 54.4, 60.1,
and 58.3° (Table 2).

XRD Analysis
In Figure 3, it is shown that only a tetragonal (T) phase structure
could be detected on the zirconia surfaces of all groups. No monoclinic

UV-A and UV-C irradiation treatments.

CCK-8 Test and ALP Activity
The CCK-8 test demonstrated
no significant difference on the proliferation of MC3T3-E1 cells on
zirconia surfaces in different groups at the culture time of 3 h.
However, after culturing for 1 day, a significantly higher MC3T3-E1
cell proliferation in Group UV-C 24 h was found, compared to the other
six groups (p < 0.05) (Figure 4A). The ALP activity test after MC3T3-E1
cells cultured on zirconia surfaces for 14 days showed that significantly
higher ALP activity was found in group UV-C 24 h compared to the control
group (p < 0.05). However, no significant difference
of ALP activity was found between all of the other groups after culturing
for 14 days (Figure 4B).

Discussion
This
laboratory study investigated the effect of time-dependent
dynamic UV irradiation process on the color, surface characteristics,
and MC3T3-E1 osteoblast cell response of osteoblasts to zirconia-based
surfaces.

One of the differences after UV-A and UV-C treatments
observed
was the color change values (ΔE) L*a*b* detected in group UV-C and
group UV-A, based on color assessment by the color spectrophotometer.
The color change values (ΔE) L*a*b* after UV-C irradiation were
much larger than those after UV-A irradiation on the zirconia specimen
for all time points. Clinically speaking, the discoloration may affect
the aesthetic performance of zirconia. Thus, it should be taken into
consideration if UV, in particular UV-C, irradiation is used on zirconia
for the aesthetic aspects. CIE (Commission Internationale de l’Eclairage),
the organization that creates international light and color standard,
introduced the main color systems, color difference (ΔE) concepts, and illumination patterns applied in color
science. ΔE has been the standard assessment
for total color difference between two objects; a greater value indicates
larger color difference and, consequently, more perceptible difference
to the human eye.25 The ΔE value that could be observed by the naked eye was reported
to be approximately 1.74–1.80 color units by 50% perceptibility
threshold.26 In another study, the mean
ΔE that could be observed by the naked eye
was 2.72 color units by 50% acceptable threshold.27,28 Thus, the color change by UV-A is not visually observable (ΔE = 0.18–0.57), whereas that by UV-C, in particular
to prolonged exposure, is easy to be seen (ΔE = 1.92–3.35).

The color change can be explained by
change of optical band gap
(Eg). In this study, the dental white
zirconia contains 3 mol % of yttria which has the band gap energy, Eg, of 4.60–4.99 eV.29,30 Upon UV irradiation, free electrons would be generated in zirconia
with a range of energies by absorption of the UV radiation energy,
and subsequently become ionized.31 The
photo-energy equation is as follows 2  where Eγ is the energy for a given wave type γ, λ is the wavelength, h is the Planck’s constant (6.626 × 10–34 J·s), and c is the speed of light (2.998 ×
108 m/s). In this study, λ of UV-A is 365 nm, that
means EUV-A is 3.397 eV; λ
of UV-C is 243 nm, so the corresponding EUV-C is 5.102 eV. The photon-energy of UV-C is higher than that of UV-A
such that EUV-A was lower than
the Eg but EUV-C was higher than Eg. Thus, UV-C can excite
valence electrons to conduction band, and charge transfer could happen
from O2– to Zr4+.32 Accordingly, at the very proximal zirconia surface <0.5
nm, the oxides would be ionized and cleave the Zr–O bonds.
Such a process can lead to: (1) creation of color centers by increasing
the number of O deficiency that decreases the Eg after UV irradiation. Consequently, the white zirconia no
longer absorbs UV only but also become yellowish and absorbs violet
and/or blue colors. This may also be the underlying reason for the
discoloration phenomenon of zirconia-containing resin composites after
UV irradiation.33 It is also worth noticing
that a sufficiently high number of O deficiency can significantly
decrease the Eg and turn zirconia into
black, that is absorb all visible lights;34 (2) together with the parallel reaction of charged oxygen species
and the hydrolysis in the atmosphere, the number of −OH and
hydrophilicity increase. Therefore, all UV-A and UV-C irradiated groups
in this study have lower WCA than the control.

It is interesting
to notice that the WCA on zirconia samples after
UV irradiation for 15 min is significantly lower than that after UV
irradiation for 3 h, in the treatment groups of both UV-A and UV-C.
The exact reason remains unknown, but possibly because the UV-A and
UV-C irradiations are both effective on chemical activity of oxygen,
that is, oxygen becomes charged and makes this treatment induce oxidation
on the zirconia surface. However, this effect could only be shown
for the initial stage, and it would not give further improvement after
1 h.35 Furthermore, the lowest WCA was
found in group UV-C 24 h of 17.3 ± 1.1°, which means a highly
hydrophilic surface condition. The result was consistent with a previous
study,17 which demonstrated obvious decrease
in the contact angle on implant surface after 40 min UV-C irradiation.

As determined by SEM, the overall morphology of the zirconia surface
did not seem to be affected by sterilization treatments used in this
study. This result was consistent with the findings of previous studies,13,36 where similar zirconia surface morphology before UV irradiation
and after UV irradiation treatment were observed. Unlike some destructive
surface treatment methods,37−39 for example grit-blasting, hydrofluoric
acid (HF) etching, and laser ablation, the UV treatment is a nondestructive
surface treatment method that only alters the surface chemistry and
does not induce morphological change.

EDX analysis showed that
the C/Zr ratio decreased significantly
after UV-C irradiation at all time points of 15 min, 3 and 24 h compared
to the control group, but not for UV-A groups. Zirconia surface can
easily adsorb any carbon species40 as compared
to other dental ceramics. Study has shown that UV irradiation could
induce the removal of adsorbed hydrocarbons and other carbonaceous
species on titanium dioxide (TiO2) by photo-oxidation and/or
by the photo-induced production of surface oxygen vacancies resulting
in a higher reactivity of the titanium surface, which then is susceptible
for dissociative water adsorption.19 In
this model, UV light should have high enough energy (i.e., larger
than the band gap of TiO2, 3.2 eV) to create surface oxygen
vacancies at bridging oxygen sites, resulting in the conversion of
relevant Ti 4p sites to Ti 3p sites, which are favorable for dissociative
water adsorption.41 As aforementioned,
in this study, UV-C has higher photon energy than UV-A that excited
the valence electrons to conduction. Therefore, UV-C irradiation can
assist the direct photolysis of carbon contaminations on zirconia
surface and increased hydrophilicity of the zirconia surface. It should
be further stressed that not all UV irradiation can induce this or
can be representable as a method to improve surface chemistry of zirconia.

According to the XRD results, zirconia samples in our study only
contained a tetragonal (t) phase structure in all of the groups. This
result was consistent with a previous study which revealed that no
evidence of zirconia phase transformation was observed in any zirconia.
This result was consistent with our previous study,36 which showed that no evidence of tetragonal (t) to monoclinic
(m) phase transformation of zirconia was detected in zirconia after
being treated by UV irradiation for 30 min on each side of zirconia.36

The other aim of this study was to evaluate
the effects of UV-A
and UV-C irradiation for different times on MC3T3-E1 proliferation
and differentiation ability on zirconia surface. UV light irradiation
has been shown to promote initial osteogenic cell attachment, proliferation,
and early bone apposition on titanium implant surfaces.42,43 In our current study, according to the CCK-8 test assessing the
proliferation ability of MC3T3-E1 on zirconia surface, significantly
higher MC3T3-E1 cells proliferation in group UV-C 24 h was shown compared
to the other groups. Group UV-C 24 h was shown in this study to have
the lowest WCA (i.e., highest hydrophilicity). Thus, this pivotal
result is influential in protein/surface interactions after implant
insertion, followed by subsequent cell/surface interactions. In fact,
hydrophilic surfaces have been proposed to positively affect the biological
reaction, such that it can increase fibronectin adsorption and osteoblastic
cells adhesion and spreading during the initial stage of osseointegration.17 Therefore, this may be reason for the highest
MC3T3-E1 cell proliferation in group UV-C 24 h on the zirconia surface
after culturing for 1 day. Moreover, no significant difference on
the proliferation of MC3T3-E1 cells on zirconia surfaces in different
groups was observed at the culture time of 3 h. The underlying reason
may be that the culture time was not long enough to observe the difference
of MC3T3-E1 proliferation ability between different groups.

According to the ALP result, significant difference of ALP activity
after culturing for 14 days was found between group UV-C 24 h and
group control. The ALP activity of MC3T3-E1 improved significantly
on the zirconia surface after UV-C irradiation for 24 h. Despite the
exact reason remains unknown, UV-C indeed created the imbalanced oxygen
stoichiometry on zirconia which triggered the electric field44,45 and sent out electrical signals46 that
fostered electron and proton transports across biological membranes.47 On the osteoblast membranes, some channels such
as gap junction channels which are responsible for different molecules
(e.g., calcium, cyclic nucleotides, and inositol phosphates) exchange
are sensitive to mechanical and electrical transductions.48,49 Various forms of titanium dioxides have shown to have different
effects of the gap junction channels,50 and it is logical to think that zirconia might have similar electrical
effects on the channels. Although inhibition of the channels would
decrease ALP and osteocalcin levels,51 and
vice versa,52 the exact proof on zirconia
has not been found. Further study is necessary.

Previous studies
applied different UV light irradiation time and
wavelengths on implant surfaces, which make the results different
when compared with each other and draw a clear conclusion. For example,
it was stated that photofunctionalization for as little as 15 min
could accelerate healing and increases bone-to-implant contact.19 Another study applied the exposure time of 40
min in total.17 Some other studies used
the UV irradiation time of as long as 2 h.6,20−22 As such, there is no consensus about what are the
most effective time exposure and UV wavelength values that could effectively
produce the best surface for osseointegration. Nevertheless, in this
study, the biological aspects of the zirconia surface on MC3T3-E1
proliferation and differentiation were shown to be improved by UV-C
irradiation on dental zirconia for 24 h; however, this irradiation
should be cautiously used because the color may change. Therefore,
this could be useful for manufacturing implant body (screw part) but
not the abutment or crown that has a high requirement of aesthetics.

The limitation of this study was that limited time points of UV
irradiation were applied in the test. More comprehensive time points
should be added in the future study. In addition, X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS) test may be applied to show chemical changes of
zirconia induced by UV light in the future study.

Conclusions
In conclusion, the color, surface free energy, and surface chemistry
of zirconia changed after both UV-A and UV-C treatments. Prolonged
24-h UV-C photofunctionalization on zirconia can enhance MC3T3-E1
