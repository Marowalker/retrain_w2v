Heterogeneous green catalysis by
using magnetically separable nanometal–oxide
catalysts has become a subject of prime focus recently. PXRD (powder
X-ray diffraction), FESEM (field emission scanning electron microscopy),
and HRTEM (high-resolution tunneling electron microscopy) with IR
and Raman spectroscopy are applied to analyze the structural and microstructural
properties of nanosized (∼15.3 nm) CuFe2O4 synthesized by both sonochemical and mechanochemical processes.
The sonochemical process provides a better uniformity of sizes of
the nanoparticles (NPs). Rietveld refinement with the PXRD pattern
reveals the inverse spinel-like architecture of CuFe2O4 NPs. The Raman spectra also indicate the phase purity of
the synthesized material. The static magnetic measurements are performed
at different magnetic fields and temperature ranges from 300 to 5
K, which confirms the existence of the ferrimagnetic phase mixed with
some finer superparamagnetic (SPM) nanophases within the sample. Unsaturated
magnetization is observed even at an applied 5 T magnetic field for
the presence of spin-canting nature in the partially inverted copper
ferrite phases at the surfaces of the nanoparticles. Now, these coupled
magnetic CuFe2O4 NPs are used as a heterogeneous
catalyst for three-component Huisgen 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition click
reaction in aqueous media. By this catalyst system, we were able to
couple alkyl halide, epoxide, or boronic acid with alkynes efficiently
to furnish 1,4-disubstituted 1,2,3-triazoles in excellent yields within
very short reaction time. The test for heterogeneity, reusability,
and reproducibility of the catalyst has also been performed successfully
without prominent decrease in yield up to the fifth cycle.

1 Introduction
Heterogeneous
green catalytic click chemistry is very important
from several perspectives: (a) green chemistry: the reaction proceeds
without using any solvent only in the presence of the catalyst, (b)
easy separation: the catalyst can be separated from the mixture by
simple filtration, (c) click chemistry: click chemistry provides the
maximum conversion.1 Catalytic click chemistry
is a unique approach for the conversion of reactant molecules to a
particular desired product in a single step or consecutive steps.
Several types of heterogeneous catalysts such as MOFs,2 metal nanoparticles (NPs),3 and
metal–oxide NPs4 are used for such
click chemistry, while usage of magnetically separable spinel ferrites
for such application is relatively scarce.5 On the other hand, copper-catalyzed azide–alkyne cycloaddition
(CuAAC) is an important “click chemistry” reaction which
has been extensively applied in chemical biology, medicinal chemistry,
and materials science. The CuAAC reaction of terminal alkynes provides
a mild and efficient synthesis of 1,4-disubstituted 1,2,3-triazoles.
However, such reaction in the case of internal alkynes to afford trisubstituted
triazoles, is still very challenging.

In recent times, the nanosized
spinel ferrites have been used as
a potent applicant in the field of materials science not only due
to their widespread technological applications but also to understand
the fundamentals of nanomagnetism.6 Interestingly,
the physical properties of such nanometric substances differ enormously
from their bulk properties. Thus, understanding and discovering a
technique for controlling superparamagnetism, collective magnetic
excitation, spin canting effect, and spin-glass (SG)-type nature of
ferrite nanomaterials require considerable thought to expand their
broad scale application in electronic and magnetic devices (microwave,
radiofrequency, optoelectronic devices, etc.), ferrofluid technology,
magnetic resonance imaging, and hyperthermia for cancer treatment.7 According to the phase diagram proposed by Villain,
Poole, and Farach, with the introduction of nonmagnetic ions in place
of magnetic ions at tetrahedral (A) and octahedral [B] sites, different
magnetic orders evolve in the spinel ferrite systems, and this is
mainly due to the modifications in the inter-sublattice A–O–B
(JAB) and intra-sublattice A–O–A (JAA) and B–O–B
(JBB) exchange interactions.8

Among
various spinel ferrites, nanosized copper ferrite (CuFe2O4) has drawn significant attention because it
is easy to synthesize, gives high yield at low cost, and is mechanically
hard and chemically stable.9 Furthermore,
it is an attractive magnetic material extensively used in a variety
of applications, such as catalysis, sensor technology, high-density
data storage, magnetic resonance imaging, and magnetically guided
drug delivery.10 Magnetic and electrical
properties of copper ferrite nanostructures are sharply guided by
the cation distribution in their specified magnetic sites.11 Copper ferrite occurs naturally in two crystallographic
spinel structures: the high-temperature cubic phase (c-CuFe2O4) and the low-temperature tetragonal phase (t-CuFe2O4). It is ferrimagnetic (Néel temperature
approximately 780 K) at room temperature (RT). The magnetization of
sublattice-A is antiparallel to sublattice-B, and both sublattices
(A and B) are ferromagnetically coupled. The overall μeff of copper ferrite arises as a result of uncompensated magnetic moments
of eight Cu2+ ions in sublattice-B. The relatively small
energy difference of Cu2+ ions in A and B sites helps to
originate five types of cation redistributions, and this is strongly
dependent on annealing temperature as well as the cooling rate.12 Thus on an A site, a single Cu2+ ion
per unit cell doubles the magnetic moment.

Under this background,
we have synthesized monodispersed, uniform-sized
CuFe2O4 NPs by the sonochemical process and
characterized them by powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), high-resolution
transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), dynamic light scattering,
selected area electron diffraction (SAED), and energy-dispersive X-ray
spectroscopy techniques to investigate its various physical properties.
Rietveld analysis reveals that CuFe2O4-NPs are
crystallized in the cubic Fd3̅m space group, and the corresponding JCPDS file number is 77-0010.
The NPs were also characterized by IR and Raman spectral analyses.
The magnetic study indicates that CuFe2O4-NPs
show strong ferromagnetic interaction with spin-canting behavior.
These CuFe2O4 NPs are employed for the heterogeneous
catalytic conversion of Huisgen 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition click reaction
in water. Through this article, we want to report in situ generation
of alkyl or aromatic azides from corresponding halide/boronic acid/epoxide
and sodium azide and subsequently their coupling with terminal and
internal alkynes in the presence of CuFe2O4 NPs.
Leaching is a major limitation in the use of heterogeneous catalysts,
and it can completely cripple application. However, we observed negligible
amount of leaching in our synthesized catalyst. The click reaction
of internal alkynes with azides, producing trisubstituted triazoles,
is extremely challenging.13 However in
our hand, from the point of reactivity, there is no difference between
terminal and internal alkynes. This result is very promising because
there are only few reports to couple internal alkynes with azides.14

2 Results and Discussions
2.1 Structural and Microstructural Analyses
Phase purity
of the bulk material has been analyzed by the PXRD
pattern (Figure 1)
of the synthesized material at the solid state, and also a detailed
structural analysis has been carried out by using Rietveld analysis.
Initially, the PXRD pattern of our sample was indexed by statistical
analysis using DICVOL0615 and TREOR90 of
the Fullprof.2k package.16 The corresponding
Miller indices and peak positions are perfectly matched with the standard
PXRD pattern of spinel ferrites.17 Structural
and microstructural properties, phase purity along with the crystal
structure, bond lengths, and bond angles were investigated by the
Rietveld refinement of the PXRD pattern for our sample using the GSAS
program18 with the EXPGUI interface.19 The results are shown in Figure 2. The refinement parameters, metal–oxide
bond lengths, and bond angles are listed in Table S1 (Supporting Information), and the fractional coordinate
as well as occupancy of different ions obtained from the refinement
by the GSAS program are provided in Table S2 (Supporting Information). According to the literature, the
Cu2+ ions have B-sites affinity rather than A-sites.20 We have fitted the PXRD pattern of the sample
with three different concentrations of Cu2+ ions occupying
[A] and [B] sites mentioned in Lakhani et al.21 It has been found that “Chi-square” (χ2) values obtained for this (Cu0.20Fe0.80)A[Cu0.80Fe1.20]BO4 cation distribution suggest good refinement of the PXRD pattern
of the sample.

Figure 1 XRD pattern of CuFe2O4 NPs.

Figure 2 Structural diagram of CuFe2O4 NP.

The average crystallite size of the sample is calculated
from the
broadening of well-defined peaks of the sample in the (XRD) pattern
by using the Debye–Scherrer equation  where ⟨D⟩ is
the average crystallite size, “λ” is the wavelength
of the incident X-ray radiation, and “θ” is the
Bragg angle. Here, “β1/2” is the full-width
at half-maximum of the XRD peak. The average estimated crystallite
size of the sample is ∼9 nm which indicates the nanocrystalline
nature of the sample and in the range of superparamagnetic limit.
The lattice parameter of the sample is calculated by taking consideration
of all peaks in the XRD pattern and is given by ∼8.2 nm.

2.2 FESEM and HRTEM Study
To have a deep
insight into the morphology of the nanocrystalline CuFe2O4, HRTEM images were taken and shown in Figure 3. During the HRTEM observation
of the SAED patterns, some representative micrographs and typical
lattice fringe patterns recorded are shown in Figure 3. The representative pattern of the micrograph
having distribution of particle size of the CF sample is shown in Figure 3a. From this study,
it is observed that the NPs are monodispersed of more or less spherical
shape with uniform size. The average crystallite size obtained from
the TEM micrograph is ∼9 nm. The SAED pattern of CF is shown
in Figure 3b. The lattice
planes corresponding to CF were detected in the SAED pattern, and
these planes are also assigned in Figure 3b. The clear rings with different diameters
(i.e., different lattice planes of CF) in Figure 3b point out the polycrystalline nature of
the CF sample. A clear lattice fringe pattern of CF is shown in Figure 3c which indicates
the well-crystalline nature of the sample. In Figure 3c, the separations between the consecutive
parallel fringes are assigned and marked according to the calculation,
and the calculated values are 2.53 and 2.10 Å and these correspond
to the (311) and (400) lattice planes of CF. The HRTEM study also
ruled out the existence of the unnecessary impurity phase in our CF
material (Figure 3b,c)
which is consistent with XRD analysis.

SAED pattern, and (c) fringe pattern of CF
NPs.

2.3 IR and
Raman Spectroscopy
We gathered
information on formation of the desired phase, existence of any impurity,
structural defects, crystallinity, and so forth from the analysis
of Raman active modes. Figure 4 shows the Raman spectra of CF NPs at RT indicating 10 prominent
peaks at 154, 219, 282, 338, 399, 471, 555, 604, 645, and 686 cm–1. All these peaks are assigned to the cubic inverse-spinel
CuFe2O4. The bands around 215, 278, 481, 586,
and 656 cm–1 are assigned to F2g (1),
Eg, F2g (2), F2g (3), and A1g, respectively, corresponding to the cubic ferrite structure. The
appearance of additional Raman peaks may be due to the breakdown of
the momentum conservation rule because the excitation wavelength (632
nm) is much larger compared to particle diameter (∼9 nm).

Figure 4 Raman
spectrum of CF NPs.

Therefore, the number
of Raman phonon modes found is incompatible
with cubic symmetry. From the observed Raman spectra of CF, the nonappearance
of the Raman mode corresponding to α-Fe2O3 and Fe clusters implies that no unnecessary impure phase is present
in the sample. In the IR spectra of CuFe2O4,
there are two strong absorption bands at about 490 cm–1 which correspond to M–O stretching vibration and O–M–O
bending vibration of CuFe2O4, respectively.

2.4 Magnetic Study
To know about the
magnetic property of our sample, SQUID analysis under field-cooled
(FC) and zero field-cooled (ZFC) conditions was recorded in the quantum
design superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) at a constant
dc magnetic field starting from 300 K down to 5 K. The M versus T curve is displayed in Figure 5. The corresponding ZFC–FC
magnetization curves in the temperature range of 5–300 K were
recorded during heating after cooling in the presence of an applied
magnetic field of 250 Oe. In addition, another comparatively higher
field of 250 Oe was applied to obtain a considerable difference between
the ZFC and FC magnetizations because this difference was used for
the evaluation of the average particle size as well as the spin-glass-like
phases present in the sample. The ZFC–FC curves of CF are bifurcated
below RT and branched out prominently with decreasing temperature.
However, with decreasing temperature below 150 K, the magnetic moment
related to the ZFC curve decreases while FC curve increases, and this
forms a clear hump in ZFC–FC curves. Below the freezing temperature,
the system proceeds into a glassy state and a strong irreversibility
between the ZFC and FC curve is shown in the M versus T curve, a typical
superparamagnetism (SPM) relaxation phenomenon of a SG- or cluster-like
system.22 Because our synthesized NPs have
size below 10 nm, it conversely indicates that the hump observed in
the ZFC and FC curves is indicating the presence of the SPM blocked
state of the NPs. This temperature corresponding to this hump is called
blocking temperature. For monodispersed NPs, the maximum point in
the ZFC curve and the bifurcation point of FC and ZFC curves are very
closely spaced. In monodispersed NPs, usually the blocking condition
is defined by single temperature, but two temperatures (TB and TP) are required to
explain the blocking condition phenomenon for distributed particles,
where TB is considered as the highest
temperature at which the ZFC and FC magnetizations are bifurcated
corresponding to the larger group of NPs present. Tp is the temperature corresponding to the peak obtained
in thermal variation of the ZFC magnetization. In fact, the ZFC magnetization
decreases below TP for the existence of
tiny particles along with lower TP than TB for such systems. In this analysis, we have
found TB is ∼300 K and that TP is near about 150 K (Figure 5). Possibly, this is due to the size distribution
of CF NPs.

Figure 5 Temperature-dependent magnetization ZFC–FC curves for CF
NPs.

The magnetic hysteresis behavior
of the sample was recorded in
temperatures 300, 150, and 5 K as shown in Figure 6. This figure exhibits a clear “S”-like
symmetry. The opening of the MH loop at lower temperatures results
in the ferromagnetic character. Apparently, the magnetic system exhibits
the coexistence of ferromagnetism and SG. The magnetization becomes
a nonlinear function of applied magnetic field and shows ferromagnetic
hysteresis nature in the lower magnetic field range. The magnetization
value of CF increases as the applied magnetic field increases. The
maximum magnetization that is saturation magnetization (MS) of CF (at 5 T) is quite high as compared to other copper
ferrite NPs.23 As the temperature decreases,
the saturation magnetization increases, and the rise in magnetization
may be attributed to a variety of factors, namely, freezing of uncompensated
surface spins, enhancing ferrimagnetic fraction by lowering the temperature,
decreasing nanocrystalline anisotropy, and so forth. The saturation
magnetizations of CF at 300, 150, and 5 K are found to be 6.6, 7.7,
and 9.3 emu g–1, respectively. The high value of
saturation magnetization authenticates that our sample can be emerged
as a proper material for applications in soft magnetic devices. Here,
very low coercivity at RT confirms soft magnetic nature of our sample.
Also, with decreasing temperature, the coercive field increases accordingly
and is found to be ∼2800 Oe at 5 K temperature. At relatively
low temperature, this huge enhancement of coercivity is mainly due
to the blocking of single-domain NPs present in the soft magnetic
system.

2.5 Heterogeneous Catalytic
Click Chemistry
Huisgen 1,3-dipolar cyclo-addition reaction
between terminal alkynes
with organic azides to afford 1,4-regioisomers of 1,2,3-triazoles
is an example of copper(I)-catalyzed click reaction and is known as
CuAAC. The coupling product 1,4-diaryl-1,2,3-triazoles have been recognized
for its anticancer activity.24 For the
click reaction of alkynes and azides, a number of homogeneous copper
catalysts have been employed though these were not applicable in practical
cases. In spite of important productivity, improved yield, high selectivity,
and simplicity of optimization of the reported homogeneous catalysts,
they have problems of product separation and purification from the
catalyst, which creates environmental barriers to expand their scope,
thus limiting their wide range of use in a number of applications.
Trace amounts of catalyst removal from the end products is very important
as metal contamination can create toxicity, especially in the pharmaceutical
industry. Even by means of careful utilization of several methods
such as chromatographic or distillation techniques, the extraction
or elimination of trace amounts of the catalyst remains a challenge.
Again, the utilization of heterogeneous and recyclable catalysts and
eco-benign solvents for the coupling of three or more components in
a single step is highly important and exciting in green chemistry.
The starting reagents need not be completely soluble for the successful
reaction. The end product can be filtered from the solution easily
in many cases, as only the purification step is required. The use
of water as an economical and safer solvent has a lot of advantages
over expensive, combustible, and toxic organic solvents, diminishing
atmospheric pollution and ease of separation of final products because
most of the organic compounds are insoluble in water. Under such conditions,
the heterogenization of click catalysis is an attractive alternative
because of the benefits of easy removal, recovery, and reusability.

Metal NPs have received much attention as dynamic catalysts for
various organic conversions and, in particular, because of enormous
availability of copper(II) NPs, they have gained very good impact
in catalysis and biology. In recent times, magnetically separable
metal NPs have been industrialized to show potential for immobilization
with the applications in catalytic transformations as readily available,
very strong, and high-surface area heterogeneous catalysts due to
their ease of separation after catalytic conversions to overcome time-consuming
and difficult separation steps. Additionally, these catalysts can
be used to give the desired products in aqueous conditions in very
short reaction times with high yields.

Copper(I)-catalyzed azide–alkyne
cycloaddition (CuAAC) is
describe here with in situ generation of alkyl or aromatic azides
from corresponding halide/boronic acid/epoxide and sodium azide and
subsequently their coupling with terminal and internal alkynes in
the presence of CuFe2O4 NPs. The click reaction
of internal alkynes with azides, to afford trisubstituted triazoles,
is very challenging.13 However, in our
hand, from the point of reactivity, there is no difference between
terminal and internal alkynes. They are showing very similar reactivity
with respect to yield and time.

To evaluate the scope of synthetic
applicability and standardization,
we selected benzyl bromide, sodium azide, and phenylacetylene as coupling
partners for azide–alkyne cycloaddition (AAC) reactions. To
optimize this facile AAC process, we struggled a lot and took several
attempts. A typical optimization for coupling of phenylacetylene with
benzyl azide is described here. To optimize the catalyst, we used
commercial Fe2O3 and sonochemically prepared
nano CuFe2O4. We found that efficient coupling
can take place only by CuFe2O4 (Table 1). Yield of the coupling product
was found to be maximum in aqueous solvent rather than miscible organic
solvent. Our initial success began with the reaction of benzyl bromide
(4 mmol) and phenylacetelene (4 mmol) as reactants and CuFe2O4 as the catalyst (0.4 mmol, 10 mol %). In the first
step, benzyl bromide (4 mmol), sodium azide (4 mmol), and CuFe2O4 (0.4 mmol) were mixed in water at RT and stirred
for 4 h. After consumption of benzyl bromide, phenylacetylene (4 mmol)
was added to the reaction mixture and stirred until it is completely
consumed [thin layer chromatography (TLC) monitoring, hexane/ethyl
acetate = 9:1]. The overall yield of the reaction is found to be 80%
(Table 1, entry 3).
A control reaction conducted in the same reaction condition but in
the absence of the catalyst gave no yield of the product despite prolonged
reaction time and higher temperature (Table 1, entry 1). When CuFe2O4 is replaced by Fe2O3 in similar reaction conditions,
trace amounts of yield of the product could be obtained (Table 1, entry 2). Organic
solvents such as dichloromethane, tetrahydrofuran, diethyl ether,
ethanol and so forth proved to be less effective or ineffective. When
the temperature of the reaction is increased to 80 °C, yield
of the reaction is increased to 90% with reduced time (Table 1, entry 4). This reaction condition
is found to be optimized. In the optimized reaction condition, we
are pleased to choose phenylboronic acid, tolyl boronic acid, styrene
oxide, allyl bromide and 4-bromo benzyl bromide, and so forth as coupling
partners (Table 2).
Phenylacetylene can be replaced by 4-tert-butyl phenylacetylene,
diphenylacetylene, o-nitrophenyl propargyl ether,
propargyl alcohol, amylacetylene, or 1 heptynyltrimethylsilyl acetylene.

2.6 Recycling the Catalyst
and Leaching
Recycling of the catalyst can be easily achieved
for this AAC reaction.
The magnetically separated and recovered catalyst was washed with
water and dichloromethane sequentially, dried, and used for the next
cycle. No significant loss of activity was found up to the fifth cycle
(Table 3).

A model reaction of phenylacetylene,
benzyl bromide, and NaN3 was designed to investigate catalyst
leaching during the
reaction time. The reaction was carried out in optimized conditions.
After half of the reaction time (90 min), the catalyst was separated
magnetically. The rest of the reaction mixture (in the absence of
the catalyst) was allowed to stir for another 90 min. As seen, no
triazole was produced after catalyst removal. These results indicate
that the catalyst is perfectly heterogeneous and catalyst leaching
is negligible under these reaction conditions. In another experiment,
the water extract of the reaction mixture after removal of the catalyst
and organic layer was used for abovementioned model reaction. However,
trace amounts of the desired triazole product were obtained. These
experiments prove that there is negligible amount of leaching of our
catalyst.

3 Conclusions
In this
endeavor, we have presented the synthesis and characterization
of bifunctional spin-canted CuFe2O4 NPs for
use in magnetically separable heterogeneous catalytic green click
chemistry. Phase pure, highly uniformed CuFe2O4 NPs have been synthesized by the sonochemical method and identified
by PXRD and Raman studies. The crystal structure and inverse nature
of this spinel have been determined by the Rietveld refinement method.
Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and HRTEM agree
with the particle size of ∼15.3 nm evaluated from the Debye–Scherrer
formula. The CuFe2O4 NPs show spin-canted behavior
with the presence of both superparamagnetic and ferrimagentic phases,
and it shows magnetic unsaturation even at 5 T. Because of its strong
magnetization, we have successfully applied the material for magnetically
separable heterogeneous catalysis for the three-component click chemistry
in aqueous medium. A simple and efficient three-component green procedure
has been developed by using the magnetically separable heterogeneous
CuFe2O4 catalyst to synthesize 1,4 disubstituted
1,2,3-triazoles in excellent yield.

4 Experimental
Details
4.1 Materials and Methods
Copper(II)
chloride, dehydrate, ferric(III) chloride, and hexahydrate were purchased
from Merck Chemical Company. All other chemicals used were of AR grade.
Raman spectra in the wavenumber range of 100–800 cm–1 of the spinel ferrite were recorded at RT using a T64000 Raman spectrophotometer
(J.Y. HORIBA) fitted with an argon ion laser using 514.5 nm as the
exciting radiation in the Raman spectrometer that interfaced with
the computer in the photon counting mode. The nanocrystalline CuFe2O4 sample was characterized by the PXRD technique,
using a Bruker D8 ADVANCE diffractometer, with Cu Kα radiation
(λ = 1.5406 Å) in the range of 2θ = 10°–80°
in steps of 0.02°. To have an idea of microstructural information,
the samples were characterized by HRTEM (JEOL, JEM-2011, operating
at 200 kV, Japan with resolution = 1.9 Å). Static magnetic measurements,
namely, magnetic hysteresis loops and temperature-dependent magnetization
curves under ZFC and FC conditions were carried out by a SQUID magnetometer
(Quantum Design, MPMS XL-7) in the temperature range of 5–300
K. Reactions were performed in oven-dried glassware. 1H
and 13C{1H} NMR spectra were recorded in Bruker AVANCE
III 400 and 300 MHz NMR spectrometers. Chemical shifts (δ) are
expressed in ppm using the residual proton resonance of the solvent
as an internal standard (CHCl3: δ = 7.26 ppm for 1H spectra, 77.36 ppm for 13C{1H} spectra,
CHDCl2/CH2Cl2, 5.32 ppm; all coupling
constants (J) are expressed in hertz and only given
for 1H–1H couplings. The following abbreviations
were used to indicate multiplicity: s (singlet), d (doublet), t (triplet),
dd (doublet of doublets), dt (doublet of triplets), m (multiplet),
bs (broad singlet), and bm (broad multiplet).

4.2 Synthesis
of CuFe2O4 NPs
Two separately prepared
100 mL solutions of CuCl2·2H2O and FeCl3 were mixed together
by intense ultrasonication for 30 min at RT. Now, 6 N NaOH solution
was added dropwise to the homogeneous mixture to maintain pH ≈
9 for precipitation. After 2 h, complete coprecipitation was obtained,
and then, the coprecipitated particles were rigorously stirred for
another 2 h. Finally, the coprecipitated particles were filtered by
the vacuum filtration method, and the residue was washed several times
by deionized triple distilled water and propanol to neutralize the
pH and remove extra ions. The filtered coprecipitated particles were
dried at 80 °C for 24 h in a hot chamber and then it was annealed
at 600 °C for 6 h in vacuum to obtain the desired pure crystalline
phase.

4.3 General Procedure for Catalytic 1,3-Dipolar
Cycloaddition
The catalytic reactions were carried out in
a glass batch reactor according to the following procedure. To a stirred
solution of the desired halide/epoxide/boronic acid (4 mmol) in 4
mL water, 4 mmol sodium azide and 0.4 mmol CuFe2O4 were added, and the reaction mixture was stirred at 80 °C for
1 h and monitored continuously by TLC (hexane/ethyl acetate = 9:1).
The reactions were performed in open air. After consumption of the
starting material, acetylene (4 mmol) was added dropwise and stirred
for 1–3 h. After completion of the reaction mixture, the catalyst
was separated and recovered by a strong magnet, and the remaining
mixture was diluted with water and extracted with ethyl acetate thrice.
The combined organic layer was dried over anhydrous Na2SO4, filtered, and concentrated to afford the crude material.
The crude material was then purified by column chromatography (silica
100–200 mesh, ethyl acetate–hexane 5–10%) to
afford the desired triazole product (yield = 55–95%). The magnetically
separated and recovered catalyst was washed with water and dichloromethane
sequentially, dried, and used for the next cycle.
