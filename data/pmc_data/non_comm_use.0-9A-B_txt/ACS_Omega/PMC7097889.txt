Protein aggregation
and oxidative stress
are two pathological hallmarks of a number of protein misfolding diseases,
including Huntington’s disease (HD). Whether protein aggregation
precedes elevation of oxidative stress or follows it remains ambiguous.
We have investigated the role of harmine, a beta-carboline alkaloid,
in aggregation of a mutant huntingtin fragment (103Q-htt) in a yeast
model of HD. We observed that harmine was able to decrease intracellular
aggregation of 103Q-htt, and this reduction was higher than that observed
with trehalose, a conventional protein stabilizer. The presence of
harmine also decreased prion formation. Decreased protein aggregation
was accompanied by reduction in oxidative stress. However, harmine
had no effect on aggregation of the mutant huntingtin fragment in
vitro. Thus, based on experimental data, we conclude that the antioxidant
harmine lowers aggregation-induced elevation in oxidative stress,
which slows down intracellular protein aggregation.

Introduction
Huntington’s disease (HD) is an
autosomal dominant neurodegenerative
disorder. Mutation in HTT (huntingtin) gene results in polyglutamine expansion at the N-terminus of huntingtin
protein, leading to its misfolding and aggregation, and ultimately
cell death.1 The length of the CAG (coding
for glutamine) repeat (at the 5′-end of huntingtin/IT-15 gene) varies from 6 to 36 in healthy individuals
and between 38 and 182 in HD patients. The misfolded protein drives
inappropriate interactions with transcription factors and proteins
involved in cell signaling and maintenance of cell integrity.2,3 Aggregation of mutant huntingtin generates oxidative stress within
the cell,4−8 that is, an imbalance
in the amount of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and antioxidative action
of the cell. ROS have the ability to damage all biomolecules, including
lipid, protein, carbohydrates, and DNA, either directly or indirectly.9 In neurological disorders such as multiple sclerosis,
stroke, and neuroinfection, and in neurodegenerative diseases such
as alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, and Huntington’s,
oxidative stress is thought to be a principal mechanism in the progression
of the disease.10,11 Examination of HD postmortem
tissues has demonstrated an increase in multiple markers of oxidative
stress,12 which suggests that oxidative
damage is increased during the course of the disease. Oxidative stress
leads to caspase-mediated neuronal cell death and is considered to
be a potential cause of observed neuropathological changes.13

Antioxidants may play an important role
in protecting against a number of human diseases.14−19 Various studies have
shown the role of antioxidants in neuroprotection.18,20−22 Protopanaxatriol
is a plant extract isolated from Panax ginseng mayer
and has shown a protective effect against 3-nitropropionic acid (3-NP)-induced
oxidative stress in a rat model of HD.20 Protopanaxtriol restores mitochondrial complex enzyme II and SOD
(superoxide dismutase) activity and directly scavenges superoxide
anions and hydroxyl radicals.20 Several
plant extracts or secondary metabolites have shown strong antioxidant
activity and protection against oxidant-induced damage in the case
of neurodegenerative disorders.14,21,22 Among these plant metabolites is harmine, a plant-derived beta-carboline
alkaloid with one indole nucleus and a six-membered pyrrole ring.23 β-Carboline alkaloids can act as scavengers
of ROS.24−26 Harmine increases
superoxide dismutase and catalase activities and decreases carbonyl
formation in mitochondria in MPTP-treated mice brains as compared
to control.27 The alkaloid is also able
to decrease Cu2+-induced oxidation of low density lipoproteins.28 Harmine increases hippocampal levels of the
brain-derived neurotrophic factor in rat brains,29 which has been implicated in a number of neurodegenerative
disorders.30 Harmine is also an inhibitor
of monoamine oxidase.31 The alkaloid is
a potent ATP-competitive inhibitor of DYRK1A (dual-specificity tyrosine-phosphorylation-regulated
kinase 1A), whose overexpression is a risk factor in β-amyloidosis,
neurofibrillary degeneration, and a number of malignant conditions.32

Studies indicate that the basic cellular
machinery is well conserved and aggregation of proteins depends on
the conserved pattern of folding, despite the species barrier.33−35 Many yeast models faithfully
recapitulate disease-relevant phenotypes which have been further validated
in mammalian systems and human patients.36 As the huntingtin gene is missing in yeast, HD
is modeled in this organism by its heterologous expression.37 The function of wild-type huntingtin is absent
in yeast, so the toxicity of mutant huntingtin is only due to its
toxic gain of function. Protein aggregation is associated with elevated
levels of oxidative stress. The purpose of the current study was to
investigate the mechanism by which harmine, an antioxidant, acts as
a neuroprotectant in protein misfolding diseases, using the well-validated
yeast model of HD. The constructs used here, pYES2-25Q-htt-EGFP and pYES2-103Q-htt-EGFP, express polyglutamine
as FLAG-25Q-htt-EGFP and FLAG-103Q-htt-EGFP, respectively.37 No separate band for EGFP has been observed
on a native gel by us and others,38,39 indicating
that the proteins are expressed as EGFP-fused products and no significant
cleaved EGFP is formed. While 25Q-htt-EGFP is seen as diffused fluorescence
throughout the cell which is taken to indicate expression of soluble
protein, 103Q-htt-EGFP is seen as discrete fluorescent puncta.37,40 We wanted to study whether harmine has aggregation inhibitory properties
or if its role is limited to reduction of oxidative stress, and thus,
an indirect effect on protein aggregation.

Results and Discussion
Trehalose
Reduces Aggregation of 103Q-htt and Increases Survival of Yeast Cells
Saccharomyces cerevisiae BY4742
cells were transformed with pYES2-25Q-htt-EGFP or
pYES2-103Q-htt-EGFP. This strain has Rnq1 protein
in the prion form ([RNQ+]), and aggregation-induced toxicity
of mutant huntingtin protein carrying longer stretches of polyQ tracts
is observed only in yeast cells of this strain.37 Cells expressing 103Q-htt showed fluorescent puncta which
confirmed the formation of aggregates (Figure 1a).37,40 Trehalose has been used
to stabilize proteins under a variety of stress conditions in vitro
and in cells.41−44 The disaccharide has no effect on expression
of the wild-type huntingtin fragment, 25Q-htt (Figure S1a–c),43 and has
been shown to have a beneficial effect in cells and animal models
of HD.45 Fluorescence microscopy suggested
that the cells in which the expression of 103-htt was induced in the
presence of 4% w v–1 trehalose showed diffusible
fluorescence as compared to cells which were untreated (Figure 1a). It was observed that in
the presence of trehalose, approximately 25% of total cells had diffused
expression of 103Q-htt as compared to untreated cells, where it was
negligible (Figure 1b). Native PAGE analysis showed a significant increase in the fraction
of soluble 103Q-htt when cells were grown in the presence of trehalose
(Figures 1c and S2a). Solubilization of 103Q-htt in the presence
of trehalose was confirmed by immunoblotting (Figures 1d and S2b).

(b) Number of cells exhibiting diffused fluorescence out of a total
1000 cells in 40 separate, randomly selected fields were counted under

diffused fluorescence were counted to quantify the extent of solubilization.

25Q-htt and 103Q-htt using DHE (λex 535 nm, λem 635 nm). Values shown are mean ± sem of three independent

The intensity of the band for the monomer, that is, 103Q-htt, was
found to be ∼1.5-fold higher as compared to cells which were
not exposed to trehalose. Being an osmolyte, trehalose stabilizes
the protein in its native conformation which leads to decreased aggregation.41,42

The effect of trehalose on aggregation of 103Q-htt was further
confirmed by filter retardation assay using a cellulose acetate membrane
which retains aggregates.46 Densitometric
analysis of dots showed that in the presence of trehalose, the amount
of aggregates was reduced by ∼1.2-fold as compared to untreated
cells (Figure 1e).
Aggregation of proteins is related to increased ROS levels within
the cell.47,48 High levels of ROS in the cell cause modification
of functional groups of amino acids which leads to protein aggregation.
Addition of trehalose had no effect on the basal level of ROS in cells
expressing 25Q-htt (Figure S3a). A significant
increase (>3.5-fold) in the fluorescence intensity of 2-hydroxyethidine
(2-EOH) was observed in cells expressing 103Q-htt as compared to those
expressing wild-type 25Q-htt (Figure 1f), which matched reports in the literature showing
a positive correlation between protein aggregation and oxidative stress.4,43,49,50 In
the presence of trehalose, cells expressing 103Q-htt had lower levels
of ROS as compared to untreated cells, although the decrease was not
significant (Figure 1f).

Aggregation of the mutant huntingtin fragment has been
linked to lower survival of yeast cells.37 Addition of trehalose had no effect on the viability of yeast cells
expressing 25Q-htt (Figure S3b). The viability
of yeast cells expressing 103Q-htt was significantly higher (∼2-fold)
when grown in the presence of trehalose than in its absence (Figure 1g). This correlates
well with higher solubilization (Figure 1c,d) and reduced aggregation (Figure 1e) of 103Q-htt observed in
the presence of trehalose.

Presence
of Harmine Reduces Aggregation of 103Q-htt
Harmine is a phyto-antioxidant
and decreases the cellular oxidative stress level by scavenging ROS.23−26 Addition
of harmine had no effect on the expression of 25Q-htt in yeast cells
as seen by fluorescence microscopy (Figure S4a), native PAGE (Figure S4b), and western
blot analysis (Figure S4c).

Aggregation
of 103Q-htt was monitored in yeast cells grown in the presence of
different concentrations of harmine, at a fixed concentration (4%
w v–1) of trehalose. As mentioned above (Figure 1b–d) and in
previous reports,43 at this concentration,
trehalose has an attenuating effect on aggregation of 103Q-htt in
yeast cells. Increasing solubilization of 103Q-htt was observed in
yeast cells with increasing concentration of harmine along with trehalose
as compared to untreated cells or cells grown in the presence of trehalose
alone (Figure 2a).

Figure 2 Harmine attenuates aggregation
of 103Q-htt in

(b) Number of cells exhibiting diffused fluorescence out of a total

diffused fluorescence were counted to quantify the extent of solubilization.

At the highest concentration of harmine (25 μg mL–1) with trehalose, approximately 55% of total cells showed diffused
fluorescence because of EGFP indicating expression of soluble 103Q-htt
as compared to untreated cells, where it is negligible (Figure 2b). Thus, in addition to the
disaccharide, the antioxidant was able to solubilize 103Q-htt. Interestingly,
at the highest concentration of harmine (25 μg mL–1), the extent of solubilization of 103Q-htt was the same, irrespective
of the presence of trehalose. Increased solubilization of 103Q-htt
was also seen by native PAGE. The intensity of the band for EGFP fused
to 103Q-htt increased with increasing concentration of harmine in
the presence of trehalose (Figures 2c and S5a). As mentioned
before, at the highest concentration of the antioxidant, solubilization
of 103Q-htt was independent of the presence of trehalose. A similar
pattern was also observed when solubilization of 103Q-htt was monitored
by immunoblotting. Cells which were grown in the presence of the maximum
concentration of harmine (25 μg mL–1) along
with trehalose showed 3-fold increase in the intensity of the band
for soluble 103Q-htt as compared to untreated cells, while this increase
in intensity jumped to ∼8-fold for cells grown in the presence
of harmine (25 μg mL–1) without trehalose
(Figures 2d and S5b).

The effect of harmine on aggregation
of 103Q-htt was confirmed by filter retardation assay using a cellulose
acetate membrane (Figure 2e). This membrane filters the proteins on the basis of size,
allowing only aggregates to be retained on the membrane.46 Densitometric analysis of dots showed that the
amount of 103Q-htt aggregates formed in the presence of harmine and
trehalose in treated cells decreased continuously as compared to untreated
cells, with the maximum reduction (>2-fold) seen with the highest
concentration of harmine in the absence of trehalose (Figure 2e).

Harmine Decreases Oxidative
Stress and Increases Cell Viability
Aggregation of proteins
is associated with increased oxidative
stress in the cell. The mechanism of aggregation-lowering ability
of harmine was followed by measuring the generation of ROS in the
cell. Addition of harmine in the media had no effect on the basal
level of ROS in yeast cells expressing 25Q-htt (Figure S4d). This shows that the activity of harmine as an
anti-oxidant is seen only when the level of ROS exceeds a threshold
value. Aggregation of 103Q-htt led to increased generation of ROS
(Figure 1e) which was
reduced when cells were grown in the presence of harmine, in the absence
or presence of trehalose (Figure 2f). Reduced aggregation of 103Q-htt and concomitant
decrease in oxidative stress resulted in increased survival of yeast
cells expressing 103Q-htt in the presence of harmine (Figure 2g). This increase was ∼2-fold
at the highest concentration of harmine (25 μg mL–1) in the absence of trehalose. Addition of trehalose and harmine
did not show any effect on the viability of yeast cells expressing
25Q-htt (Figure S4e). Thus, in the presence
of the antioxidant harmine, aggregation of 103Q-htt was reduced, corresponding
with reduced oxidative stress and increased cell viability.

The presence of prions, specifically [RNQ1+], seems to
be an essential condition for aggregation-induced proteotoxicity in
yeast cells.37 Hence, the aggregation status
of Rnq1 was monitored in yeast cells in the presence of harmine. Yeast
cells transformed with pYES2-Rnq1-EGFP were induced
to express Rnq1-EGFP in the absence and presence of harmine. Native
PAGE analysis of the cell lysate showed that solubilization of Rnq1
increased with increasing concentration of harmine (Figures 2h and S6). Prion formation ([RNQ1+]) was monitored by
filter retardation assay. Analysis of the blot showed that in the
presence of harmine, the extent of aggregation of Rnq1 was significantly
reduced as compared to untreated cells (Figure 2i). Attenuated prion formation ([RNQ1+]) also correlated with reduced intracellular oxidative stress
(Figure 2j). Increased
prion formation, that is, [RNQ1+], has been directly correlated
with aggregation of 103Q-htt in yeast cells due to the “seeding”
activity of the prion protein.37 Decreased
formation of prion in the presence of the anti-oxidant harmine may
be responsible for the inhibition of aggregation of 103Q-htt observed
in this case.

Harmine Has No Effect
on Aggregation of the Mutant Huntingtin Fragment in Vitro
The increased ROS level in cells causes oxidative damage to proteins.4,49 Conversely, the presence of misfolded and aggregated proteins enhances
the level of ROS in the cell, primarily by mitochondrial dysfunction.15,51−54 Reduction in intracellular oxidative stress
observed above could be due to decrease in protein aggregation in
the presence of harmine. On the other hand, reduced oxidative stress
with consequent reduction in oxidative damage to proteins could result
in decreased aggregation of 103Q-htt in the presence of harmine. Whether
oxidative damage precedes or follows protein aggregation and the step
at which harmine intervenes in this process remain to be determined.
Hence, we decided to investigate whether harmine has any effect on
aggregation of expanded polyglutamine in an extracellular milieu.
Aggregation of the polyglutamine tract (in the pathogenic range) occurs
in a length-dependent manner. The pattern of aggregation remains unaltered.
A change is seen in aggregation kinetics, with longer polyQ stretches
exhibiting faster rates of aggregation37,40,55−58 and higher toxicity.37,56−58 Because
for lengths >72Q, aggregation occurs quite fast46 and measurement of difference in rates becomes difficult,
we selected the well-validated elongated polyQ-containing 51Q-htt
system39,46 to monitor differences in rates aggregation
of polyQ in the presence of harmine in vitro.

The mutant huntingtin
fragment (GST-51Q-htt) was purified by affinity chromatography, as
described before.46,59 Purification of the protein was
followed by SDS-PAGE which showed a band at the expected position
(∼50 kDa) (Figure 3a).46,59 Immunoblotting with the polyglutamine
antibody showed a tail (Figures 3b and S7) because of truncated
polyglutamine tracts.39,46 In vitro aggregation of 51Q-htt
was monitored by Thioflavin T fluorescence assay.39,59 Aggregation
kinetics showed distinct nucleation, growth (fibrillation), and equilibrium
(saturation) stages (Figure 3c) and confirmed that the aggregates formed were of cross
β-sheet nature.46,59,60 No
significant difference in the pattern of aggregation of 51Q-htt was
seen when the protein was incubated in the presence of harmine (6.25
or 25 μg mL–1) than in its absence.

Figure 3 Harmine has no effect on aggregation of 103Q-htt
in vitro.
(a) Purification of GST-51Q-htt was carried out by affinity chromatography
and followed by SDS-PAGE. Lane 1: molecular weight marker (bovine

cell lysate, lane 4: flowthrough; lanes 5 and 6: washings, lanes 7
and 8: eluates, and lane 9: dialyzed protein. Protein load was 10
μg in each case. The gel was Coomassie stained. (b) Western
blot analysis of purification of GST-51Q-htt; lane 1: cell lysate,
lane 2: flowthrough, lanes 2 and 3: washings, lanes 5 and 6: eluted
GST-51Q-htt, and lane 7: dialyzed protein. Protein load was 20 μg
each lane. The membrane was probed with a polyglutamine antibody followed
by an FITC-conjugated antimouse antibody. The Ponceau S-stained membrane
is shown in Figure S7. (c) GST-51Q-htt
(1 mg mL–1) was incubated at 37 °C. Time-dependent
formation of aggregates was monitored by Thioflavin T fluorimetry
(λex 440 nm, λem 484 nm). The final
concentrations of the protein and the fluorophore were 1.5 and 50
μM, respectively. (d) GST-51Q-htt (1 mg mL–1, 40 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0 containing 150 mM NaCl) was incubated
at 37 °C at different time intervals. Filter retardation assay
using a cellulose acetate membrane (0.2 μm) was carried out
at different time intervals, and the amount of aggregates retained
was probed with the polyglutamine antibody. The intensity of the dot
at the last point of analysis was assigned an arbitrary value of 100%.
Triplicate dots are shown for each time point in Figure S8a. (e) GST-51Q-htt (1 mg mL–1,
40 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0 containing 150 mM NaCl) was incubated
at 37 °C at different time intervals. The incubated protein was
filtered through the nitrocellulose membrane and analyzed with the
oligomer-specific A11 antibody using a dot-blot assay. The intensity
of the dot for the protein incubated alone till 75 h was assigned
a value of 100%. Triplicate dots are shown for each time point in Figure S8b. Values shown are mean ± sem
of three independent experiments.

The effect of harmine on aggregation of 51Q-htt was further studied
by filter retardation assay using the polyglutamine antibody as the
probe (Figures 3d and S8a). Unlike Thioflavin T which is an amyloid-specific
dye and quantifies the fibrillar aggregates formed (Figure 3c), filter retardation assay
quantifies the total amount of aggregates. Comparison of the two curves
suggests formation of amorphous aggregates at initial stages followed
by fibrillar aggregates. The formation of oligomers during incubation
was detected with an oligomer-specific A11 antibody (Figures 3e and S8b). Almost similar patterns were observed in the absence
and presence of harmine when the membrane was probed with the A11
antibody. Analysis of both curves suggests that harmine had no effect
on either oligomer formation or aggregation of 51Q-htt in vitro.

Thus, it is clear that harmine had no direct effect on aggregation
of the mutant huntingtin fragment. Instead, inhibition of aggregation
of the mutant huntingtin fragment observed in yeast cells resulted
from antioxidation activity of harmine. Harmine scavenges ROS which
lowers oxidative damage to the mutant huntingtin fragment. As damage
to proteins due to oxidative stress is responsible for protein aggregation
in many protein misfolding disorders,15,51−54 the presence of the antioxidant reduces aggregation of the mutant
huntingtin fragment by attenuating oxidative damage and ameliorating
aggregation-induced cytotoxicity.

Misfolding and aggregation
of proteins have been linked to the development and progression of
a number of neurodegenerative and other disorders. A number of epidemiological
studies have established correlations between lifestyle choices and
progression of disease conditions. For example, coffee drinking and
cigarette smoking have been shown to have a negative correlation with
disease progression in Parkinson’s disease.61,62 We
have shown that caffeine63 and nicotine64 alter the rate of aggregation of α-synuclein
and increase the survival of yeast cells expressing α-synuclein,
thus providing a mechanistic explanation for the observations. In
the present case, the antioxidant harmine is seen to be as good a
protein stabilizer under intracellular conditions as the disaccharide
trehalose, a known protein stabilizer, although it follows a different
mode of action. The level of inhibition of aggregation seen in the
presence of harmine and trehalose was marginally lower than that in
the presence of the highest concentration of harmine alone. The decreasing
level of aggregation of 103Q-htt with increasing concentration of
harmine and fixed concentration of trehalose also reflects the importance
of the antioxidant in slowing down protein aggregation inside the
cell. The presence of harmine lowers the oxidative stress and hence
aggregation of oxidatively damaged proteins. Under these conditions,
the presence of trehalose does not provide any additional benefit
to the cell.

Methods
Expression of 25Q-htt and
103Q-htt in Yeast Cells
S. cerevisiae BY4742 strain was
transformed separately with pYES2-25Q-htt-EGFP or
pYES2-103Q-htt-EGFP by the lithium acetate–polyethylene
glycol (PEG) method.65 Transformed cells
were grown in SC-URA media containing 2% (w v–1)
dextrose at 30 °C, 200 rpm till OD600nm 0.6–0.8.
Expression of proteins was induced by changing the media to SC-URA
media containing 2% (w v–1) galactose, with and
without 4% (w v–1) trehalose and different concentrations
of harmine for 10 h. Expression of 25Q-htt and 103Q-htt was monitored
by fluorescence microscopy (E600 Eclipse microscope, Nikon, Japan)
as the proteins were tagged with EGFP. Yeast cells were disrupted
using acid-treated glass beads and lysed using lysis buffer (0.05
M Tris, 0.15 M NaCl, 0.002 M DTT, pH 7.5 supplemented with 1 mM PMSF).66 The lysate was centrifuged at 800g for 10 min, and the supernatant obtained was analyzed for the presence
of aggregates using filter retardation assay. This supernatant was
further centrifuged at 12,000g for 45 min, and the
presence of soluble protein was confirmed by native PAGE and immunoblotting
using the polyglutamine-specific antibody. The respective gel and
blot were scanned using an image scanner (Typhoon Trio, GE Healthcare).
Estimation of the protein content in different samples was carried
out by the dye binding method,67 using
bovine serum albumin as the standard protein.

Filter Retardation
Assay
The supernatants
(obtained after centrifugation of yeast cell lysates at 800g for 10 min) were filtered through a cellulose acetate
membrane (0.2 μm pore size) using a dot blot apparatus (Whatman
Schleicher & Schuell, UK). For in vitro analysis of the aggregation
pattern, affinity purified 51Q-htt was incubated at 37 °C for
95 h.39 Aliquots (50 μg protein each)
were withdrawn at regular intervals and vacuum-filtered through a
prewetted cellulose acetate membrane. The membranes were probed with
the polyglutamine-specific antibody for detection of aggregates. Aliquots
were also filtered through a nitrocellulose membrane and probed with
the oligomer-specific A11 polyclonal antibody for detection of oligomers.39 The membranes were scanned on an image scanner
(Typhoon Trio, GE Healthcare). The intensity of dots was quantified
using ImageQuant TL software (GE Healthcare). The values were fitted
into the equation for a sigmoidal curve (Boltzmann function) using
the equation,39,60  where yi + mxi is the initial
line, yf + mxf is the final line, and x0 is the midpoint
of the maximum signal.

Measurement of Oxidative Stress
Intracellular ROS levels
were quantified using DHE (dihydroethidium) dye.68 After the end of the induction period, yeast cells were
washed with phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4 (PBS), and counted using
Neubauer’s chamber. Cells (1 × 107) were aliquoted
into a microcentrifuge tube, and DHE (0.01 M, in PBS) was added at
a final concentration of 10 μM. The final reaction mixture was
made up to 1 mL with PBS and incubated at 37 °C with shaking
at 200 rpm for 20 min. The emission intensity of ethidium was recorded
at λem 635 nm using λex 535 nm.

Cell Viability Assay
Postinduction
yeast cells were pelleted down, resuspended in 1 mL autoclaved water,
and counted using Neubauer’s chamber. Cells (1 × 103) were plated on SC-URA containing 2% dextrose plates, and
growth of colonies was observed at 30 °C for 3 days.

Measurement
of Uptake of Harmine by Yeast Cells
The amount of harmine
taken up by yeast cells was determined by
HPLC (SCL-10A VP, Shimadzu, Japan).69 Yeast
cell pellets were thawed on ice, resuspended in 500 μL of 0.5
M trichloroacetic acid, and incubated at room temperature for 1 h.
The cell lysates were centrifuged at 12,000g for
30 min at room temperature. The supernatants were collected, and the
pellets were resuspended in 500 μL of 0.5 M trichloroacetic
acid and incubated at room temperature for 1 h. The suspensions were
centrifuged as mentioned above, and the supernatants were pooled and
filtered through a 0.2 μm syringe filter. Samples were injected
into a C18 Zorbax analysis column (Agilent Technologies, USA), and
the eluate was monitored using a photodiode array detector (UV 10A,
Shimadzu, Japan) at a flow rate of 1 mL min–1.69 The mobile phase used was isopropyl alcohol/acetonitrile/water/formic
acid in the ratio 100:100:300:0.3 (v/v/v/v), pH 8.6 [adjusted with
triethylamine (99%)].69

Aggregation
of the Mutant Huntingtin Protein Fragment
in Vitro
Competent Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) cells were transformed with plasmid pGEX-5X1-HDex1-CAG51 and grown at 37 °C in Luria–Bertani media. Protein expression
was induced with 1 mM IPTG for 5 h at 37 °C.46 The mutant huntingtin protein fragment (GST-51Q-htt) was
purified by affinity chromatography, as described earlier.46,59 Purification of 51Q-htt protein was confirmed by SDS-PAGE.

Purified 51Q-htt (1 mg mL–1) was incubated with
and without harmine (6.25 and 25 μg mL–1)
at 37 °C. Aliquots (25 μg each) were withdrawn at regular
time intervals and the aggregation pattern of 51Q-htt was monitored
by thioflavin T fluorescence assay.39,60 Fluorescence
intensity of the dye was measured using a spectrofluorimeter (RF-5301PC,
Shimadzu) with λex 440 nm and λem 484 nm.
