Ubiquitousness in
the target organs and associated oxidative stress
are the most common manifestations of heavy-metal poisoning in living
bodies. While chelation of toxic heavy metals is important as therapeutic
strategy, scavenging of increased reactive oxygen species, reactive
nitrogen species and free radicals are equally important. Here, we
have studied the lead (Pb) chelating efficacy of a model flavonoid
morin using steady-state and picosecond-resolved optical spectroscopy.
The efficacy of morin in presence of other flavonoid (naringin) and
polyphenol (ellagic acid) leading to synergistic combination has also
been confirmed from the spectroscopic studies. Our studies further
reveal that antioxidant activity (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl assay)
of the Pb–morin complex is sustainable compared to that of
Pb-free morin. The metal–morin chelate is also found to be
significantly soluble compared to that of morin in aqueous media.
Heavy-metal chelation and sustainable antioxidant activity of the
soluble chelate complex are found to accelerate the Pb-detoxification
in the chemical bench (in vitro). Considering the synergistic effect
of flavonoids in Pb-detoxification and their omnipresence in medicinal
plants, we have prepared a mixture (SKP17LIV01) of flavonoids and
polyphenols of plant origin. The mixture has been characterized using
high-resolution liquid chromatography assisted mass spectrometry.
The mixture (SKP17LIV01) containing 34 flavonoids and 76 other polyphenols
have been used to investigate the Pb detoxification in mouse model.
The biochemical and histopathological studies on the mouse model confirm
the dual action in preclinical studies.

==== Body
Introduction
Lead (Pb), one of the
most widely used metals in the industry and
simultaneously a versatile, subtle, and persistent poison present
in Earth’s crust, can induce a wide array of physiological,
biochemical, and behavioral dysfunctions affecting almost every organ
system (central and peripheral nervous, hematopoietic, respiratory,
cardiovascular, renal, hepatic and reproductive system) cumulating
in death.1−4 Although Pb toxicity has been documented as early as 2000 BC and
found to be preventable, victims of such toxicity in human civilization
are evident in recent times.5 Even in 2015,
494 550 deaths occurred due to Pb exposure, which is 0.6% of
the global burden of diseases and 9.3 million disability-adjusted
life years.4,6,7 Of particular
concern is the role of Pb exposure in the development of intellectual
disability in children.7 Though there is
wide recognition of this problem and many countries have acted to
stop its use, exposure to Pb, particularly
in childhood, remains a key concern for health care providers and
public health officials worldwide. Though Pb itself is a nonredox
metal and does not possess any prooxidant catalytic activity, it rather
converts to some indirect mechanisms [e.g., auto-oxidation of hemoglobin
(Hb), accumulation, and subsequent auto-oxidation of δ-aminolevulinic
acid induced by Pb] for imparting pathogenesis via oxidative disturbances.4,8−10 Thus, controlling the free-radical-induced intracellular
damage is equally important in combating Pb poisoning alongside the
removal of the same from organs. On the other hand, the currently
approved treatment for Pb toxicity (use of chelating agents such as
2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid and CaNa2EDTA) can neither
be used at a therapeutically adequate dose for a prolonged period
of time owing to a number of shortcomings and inherent toxicity (e.g.,
nephrotoxicity, cardiotoxicity, zinc dieresis, nausea, fever, and
breathing trouble) nor reduce the significant oxidative stress generated
due to cellular Pb exposure.3,11 Therefore, considering
the indispensable necessity of an alternative therapeutic approach,
an exogenously supplied chelator with sustainable antioxidant activity
even after complexation with Pb can be an ideal therapeutic detoxification
strategy.

Flavonoids, a class of natural polyphenols with a
benzo-γ-pyrone
structure ubiquitously present in plants, are widely known for their
antioxidant activity.12−14 Since their discovery in 1936, several studies have
determined the flavonoid antioxidant activity, many of which have
used pure compounds, calculated individual antioxidation power, and
performed structure–activity relationship studies.14−16 In other studies, the antioxidation power of a given food or plant
sample has been characterized in depth and, in some cases, the correlation
between flavonoid composition and antioxidation power has been examined.17−19 The other most studied property of flavonoids is the metal ion chelation
ability. Several studies have reported interactions between flavonoids
and metal ions leading to chelate formation, which are only slightly
active in the promotion of free-radical reactions.13,20−22 Although several studies have shown that plants use
this chelation property for the detoxification of heavy metals,23−25 in-depth study on the interaction of heavy metals with flavonoids
is sparse in contemporary literature. Some of the recent studies focus
on the antioxidation properties of flavonoid–transition-metal
complex (e.g., Fe3+, Cr3+, Cu2+,
and Al3+).26−31 However, to the best of our knowledge, no study has addressed the
sustainable antioxidation activity imparted due to heavy-metal chelation
to flavonoid alone or in mixture with other polyphenols and is one
of the motives of the present study.

Here, we have studied a
model heavy-metal (Pb) chelating efficacy
of a model flavonoid (morin) using steady-state and picosecond-resolved
optical spectroscopy. The efficacy of morin in the presence of other
flavonoid (naringin) and polyphenol (ellagic acid, EA) leading to
synergistic combination has also been confirmed from the spectroscopic
studies. This is particularly important because previous observations
suggest that polyphenolic mixtures show fewer side effects than the
pure compounds due to interactions among themselves.32,33 Our studies reveal that the antioxidant activity [2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl
(DPPH) assay] of the Pb–morin complex is sustainable compared
to that of Pb-free morin. We have also found that the solubility of
the Pb–morin complex increases significantly compared to that
of morin in an aqueous environment. Heavy-metal chelation and sustainable
antioxidant activity of the chelate complex are found to accelerate
the Pb detoxification in the chemical bench (in vitro). Considering
the synergistic effect of flavonoids in Pb detoxification and their
omnipresence in medicinal plants, we have prepared a mixture (SKP17LIV01)
of flavonoids containing 34 flavonoids and 76 other polyphenols and
investigated the Pb detoxification in mouse model. The biochemical
and histopathological studies confirm the dual action in preclinical
studies. Our studies on biodistribution of Pb in various target organs
of the intoxicated mice using inductively coupled plasma-assisted
atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) confirm that SKP17LIV01 efficiently
facilitates excretion of Pb from mice body after heavy-metal chelation
and sustainable reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging in vivo.

Materials
and Methods
Materials
Morin, EA, naringin, quercetin, lead nitrate
(Pb(NO3)2), sodium chloride (NaCl), sodium hydroxide
(NaOH), and DPPH were purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO, USA). All
solvents were obtained from Merck (NJ, USA) unless otherwise stated.
All reagents were of analytical grade and used without further purification.
Nanopure water (resistivity ≥ 18 MΩ cm) from Milli-Q
system (Millipore GmbH, Germany) was used whenever required. In order
to prepare a mixture of flavonoids and polyphenols, we have used a
well-characterized (by using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography
mass spectrometry; UHPLC–MS) extract from eight medicinal plants
(Table S1). We call the mixture to be SKP17LIV01.
The detailed characteristics and systems pharmacology of the extract
will be published elsewhere.

Fingerprint Analysis Using UHPLC–MS
For complete
chemical characterization of SKP17LIV01, we used fingerprint analysis
by ultra-high-resolution LC–MS. Mass spectra were recorded
by electrospray ionization in both negative and positive modes using
an Agilent 1290 Infinity UHPLC System (MS Q-TOF, model G6550A, Agilent
Technologies, CA, USA) equipped with a C-18 stainless steel column
(30 cm × 0.46 cm). The capillary voltage was kept at 80 V, and
the air (nebulizing gas) pressure was 35 psi. Full scan data acquisition
was performed by scanning from m/z 50 to 1000 with isolation width ≈4.0 amu. The oven temperature
was set to 40 °C, and mobile phase A consisted of 100% water,
whereas mobile phase B consisted of a mixture of 90% acetonitrile,
10% water, and 0.1% formic acid. Sample (0.02 mL) was injected. A
flow rate of 0.2 mL/min was used. An elution gradient ranging from
5% B to 95% B from 0 to 20 min was used. Identification of major compounds
was accomplished by analyzing the molecular ion peak and base peak
using an Agilent MassHunter Workstation (Agilent Technologies CA,
USA).

UV–Vis and Fluorescence Spectroscopy
Optical
absorbance spectra were recorded on a double-beam spectrophotometer
(model UV-2600, Shimadzu, Japan) in the 200–800 nm range. Fluorescence
spectra were obtained with a fluorescence spectrophotometer (LifeSpec-ps,
Edinburgh Instruments, UK) equipped with a microchannel plate–photomultiplier
tube (MCP–PMT, Hamamatsu, Japan). The excitation wavelength
was set at 375 nm. Fluorescence spectra were corrected for variations
with wavelength in source intensity, photomultiplier response, and
monochromator throughput.

Solutions and Experimental Method
Stock solutions of
morin, naringin, and EA were prepared in 0.01 N NaOH. They were further
diluted using water as a solvent. NaCl was used to keep the ionic
strength constant (0.1 M). Incremental volumes of Pb(NO3)2 stock solution (0.15 M) were added to the polyphenol
reaction mixture in order to vary the molar ratio, and the pH was
maintained constant (pH = 7.4) by small additions of NaOH. A syringe
pump (Pump 11 Pico Plus Elite, Harvard Apparatus, MA, USA) was used
to circulate the solution from the titration beaker to the experiment
cell. UV–vis absorbance and fluorescence spectra were recorded
for each molar ratio and used for further calculations. All measurements
were performed in a 1 cm quartz cuvette, hermetically closed, and
thermostatized at 298.0 ± 1.5 K.

Time-Correlated Single-Photon
Counting Measurement
PL transients of the solutions were
measured and fitted using a commercially
available picosecond diode laser-pumped time-resolved fluorescence
spectrophotometer (LifeSpec-ps, Edinburgh Instruments, UK) [excitation
wavelength 375 nm, 80 ps instrument response function (IRF)] with
a temperature controller attachment (Julabo, model F32). Time-correlated
single-photon counting (TCSPC) technique was used to capture all transients.
Photoluminescence was detected from the samples using a MCP–PMT
(Hamamatsu, Japan) after dispersion through a grating monochromator
(polarizer was set at 55°). The observed fluorescence transients
are fitted by using a nonlinear least-square fitting procedure to
a function  comprising
convolution of IRF (E(t)) with a
sum of exponentials  with pre-exponential factors (Yi), characteristic lifetimes (τi), and a background (X). Relative percentage
in a multiexponential decay is finally expressed as  The
quality of the curve fitting is evaluated
by reduced chi-squared and residual data.

DPPH Assay
The
free-radical scavenging activity of
the samples of interest was determined using the DPPH method. Sample
(0.5 mL, in varied concentration) was added to 3.0 mL of freshly prepared
ethanolic DPPH solution (0.1 mM). The change in absorbance was monitored
at 535 nm for 60 min. EC50 values were measured from the
percentage inhibition at different concentrations.  

EC50 is the concentration
value which scavenged 50% of the DPPH radicals. Trolox was used as
the reference compounds.

For DPPH assay, synthesis of Pb(II)–morin
complex was done
by the addition of solid Pb(NO3)2 (0.1 M final
concentration) in ethanolic solution of morin (0.01 M). The mixture
was stirred for 1.5 h. Then, it was filtered and subsequently evaporated
on a rotary evaporator. The resulting product was washed with 1:1 t-butanol/chloroform to remove unreacted morin. An olive
green product Pb(II)–morin complex was then obtained, which
was used for further studies.

Animal Model and Treatment
Six-week-old healthy Swiss
albino mice weighing 25.1 ± 2.0 g, maintained in polypropylene
cages under 12 h light/dark cycle in a temperature (25.0 ± 1.5
°C)- and humidity (50.0 ± 5%)-controlled room with food
(Hindustan Lever, New Delhi, India) and water ad libitum, were randomly
divided into four groups (N = 10/group) after 2 weeks
of acclimatization. Group I served as control and received physiological
saline (0.9% NaCl) by oral gavage during the whole course of experiment.
Groups II–IV intraperitoneally received an aqueous solution
of Pb(NO3)2 [50 mg/kg body weight (BW)] in every
alternative day for 4 weeks for the induction of oxidative stress
and associated liver damage. Then, group II was left untreated and
served as a negative control. After induction, groups III and IV daily
received (orally) SKP17LIV01 (3.5 mL/kg BW) and silymarin (100 mg/kg
BW), respectively. All animal experiments were performed according
to the guidelines recommended by the Committee for the Purpose of
Control and Supervision of Experiments on Animals (CPCSEA), New Delhi,
India, and approved by the Institutional Animal Ethics Committee (approval
no.—JU-Dey’s/IAEC/09/14, dated 31.01.2014).

Blood Collection
and Serum Isolation
At the end of
requisite fasting period, blood was collected from each mouse by retro-orbital
venous puncture and kept in microcentrifuge tubes with and without
ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (2.0%). The tubes were placed in slanting
position at room temperature (RT) for 2 h. Then, they were centrifuged
at 3500g for 10 min. Serum was separated and used
for further analyses.

Assessment of Hematological and Liver Function
Parameters
Biochemical parameters such as serum enzymes,
aspartate aminotransferase
(AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), serum alkaline phosphatase
(ALP), gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), and total and direct bilirubin
along with total protein (TP) were assayed using assay kits (Span
Diagnostic, Surat, India) following the protocol prescribed by manufacturers.
The European standardized method was used to determine the blood delta-aminolevulinic
acid dehydratase (ALAD) activity.34 For
hematological studies, the blood was collected in heparinized tubes.
Hematological parameters were obtained by an automated cell counter
(Medonic CA 620, Boule Diagnostics, Sweden). Parameters studied were
Hb, total red blood cell, reticulocyte, hematocrit, mean corpuscular
volume, mean corpuscular Hb, mean corpuscular Hb concentration, platelets,
total white blood cell, and differential count.

In Vivo Distribution
of Pb in Blood and Liver
The Pb(II)
contents in the liver and blood were estimated using ICP-AES (ARCOS,
SPECTRO Analytical Instruments GmbH, Germany). The samples were prepared
using the open acid digestion method. In brief, dried tissues were
dissolved in HNO3 (15 mL), H2SO4 (10
mL), and H2O2 (5 mL), heated at 120 °C
until only a residue remained, and then diluted with deionized water
to 10 mL.

Histopathology
For microscopic evaluation,
a conventional
technique of paraffin wax sectioning and differential staining was
used. Liver tissues were excised, fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin
saline for 72 h, dehydrated in graduated ethanol (50–100%),
cleared in xylene, and embedded in paraffin. Sections (4–5
μm thick) were cut using microtome, stained with hematoxylin
and eosin (H&E), and examined under an Olympus BX51 fluorescence
microscope (Olympus Optical, Tokyo, Japan). In this staining process,
hematoxylin gives deep blue-purple color to nucleic acid, whereas
eosin provides pink color to the proteins.35

Tissue Homogenate Preparation
Tissues from the four
groups of animals were collected, minced, and lysed in radio immunoprecipitation
assay buffer (Sigma, USA) (5 mg tissue in 0.5 mL buffer) for 30 min.
After centrifugation at 12 000g for 15 min
at 4 °C, supernatants were collected and stored in aliquots at
−80 °C for further use. Protein concentration of the aliquots
was determined according to Bradford method.

Antioxidant Enzyme Activity
and Lipid Peroxidation
The activity of superoxide dismutase
(SOD) and catalase (CAT) was
measured following reported methods.36,37 Reduced glutathione
(GSH) was determined using Ellman’s method.38 For activity measurement of glutathione peroxidase (GPx),
we followed a modified method of Lawrence and Burk.39 To assess the extent of lipid peroxidation, the level of
malonyldialdehyde (MDA), a substance that reacts with thiobarbituric
acid, was determined in the homogenates of organs and in serum according
to the method of Buege.40

Statistical
Analysis
All quantitative data are expressed
as mean ± standard deviation (SD) unless otherwise stated. One-way
analysis of variance followed by Tukey’s multiple comparison
tests was executed for comparison of different parameters between
the groups using a computer program GraphPad Prism (version 5.00 for
Windows), GraphPad Software, California, USA. p <
0.05 was considered significant.

Results and Discussion
Interaction
of Morin: A Model Flavonoid with Heavy-Metal Lead
(Pb2+)
Primarily, we chose morin (3,5,7,2′,4′-pentahydroxyflavone)
(Figure 1a) as a representative
of flavonoid class for understanding its heavy-metal chelating activity.
Morin is very special among flavonols as it is one of those few natural
flavonols that bears a OH group in position 2′ that can be
involved in a hydrogen bond with 3-OH, leading to far reaching consequences.13 Despite being the most abundant polyphenol in
our diet or in nature, this unique structural feature along with previously
reported antiradical activity41 made morin
our molecule of interest. The absorbance spectra of morin (Figure 1b) show two absorption
maxima centered at ∼255 nm (band II) and ∼354 nm (band
I) corresponding to the Π → Π* electronic transition
originating at benzoyl (flavonoid ring A) and cinnamoyl (flavonoid
ring B) systems, respectively. The interaction of morin with Pb2+ produced large bathochromatic shift (∼45 nm) in band
I maxima (Figure 1b).
In contrast, band II remained unaffected. The exclusive change in
band I indicates the involvement of cinnamoyl system in the complexation
process. Among the three probable binding sites (3-OH and 4-oxo, 3-OH
and 2′-OH, or 5-OH and 4-oxo) present in morin, 3-OH and 4-oxo
is the most preferable site of co-ordination because of the presence
of highly acidic proton, stronger chelation ability, and greater delocalization
of the oxygen at 3-OH.42,43 The stoichiometry of complexation
was investigated by using Job’s method (the method of continuous
variation).44 Considering a global equilibrium
of Pb(II) and n ligands (L) on the form  where n is determined from
the plot of the absorbance as a function of the mole fraction, f, of the added ligand. In the absorbance maximum

nm). Inset shows Stern–Volmer and modified Stern–Volmer
plots for the interaction (λem = 550 nm). (d) Time-resolved
fluorescence transients of morin (2.66 × 10–4 M) in the absence and presence of Pb2+ (37.7 × 10–4 M).

Inset of Figure 1b represents a typical Job plot for the Pb(II)–morin
system,
in which the transition point for absorbance appeared at the molar
fraction of 0.33, suggesting that morin (L) bound to Pb2+ with a 2:1 ratio in the complex (PbL2). The observed
new band at ∼413 nm (Figure 1b) due to complexation corresponds to the formation
of Pb–3-OH, forming a big extended Π-bonding system with
the inclusion of C ring leading to further stabilization.45 The electronic transition within morin shifts
from n−Π* to lower energy Π–Π* favoring
the development of a new band at higher wavelength.46,47 The binding constant of the Morin–Pb2+ complex
was found to be 1.803 × 104 M–1 (R2 = 0.987) using the Benesi–Hildebrand
equation48  where, A0, A, and Af are the absorption
values, in the absence of, at the intermediate, and at the saturation
of the interaction of Pb2+ ion, respectively, and [Pb2+] represents the concentration of aqueous Pb2+ ion added. The binding constant (Kb)
was determined by linear fitting of absorption titration curve (Figure S1).

In the photoluminescence study,
morin shows a strong emission at
∼550 nm when excited at ∼375 nm (Figure 1c). The observed fluorescence is probably
originating from the anion form of the 7-OH group of the pyrone ring,
as it gets deprotonated first owing to its low pKa of deprotonation (pKa 3.80),
and as a result, morin stays as monodepronated species in a solution
of physiological pH.49,50 In the presence of Pb2+, the fluorescence quenched (Figure 1c). The phenomenon of fluorescence quenching can be
attributed to several molecular mechanisms including excited-state
reactions, molecular rearrangements, energy transfer, ground-state
complex formation, and collisional quenching. In the case of morin,
no discernible shift in emission maxima (∼550 nm) or shape
of the fluorescence spectrum accompanied quenching and the quenching
behavior generally adhered to the Stern–Volmer equation (eq 1). 1  where F0 and F are the
fluorescence intensities in the absence and presence
of a quencher, [Q], Ksv is the Stern–Volmer
quenching constant, kq is the bimolecular
quenching rate constant, and τ0 and τ are the
fluorescence lifetimes of the fluorophore in the absence and presence
of the quencher, respectively.51 The linearity
in the Stern–Volmer plot (Figure 1c, inset) indicates the existence of a single
type of quenching, either static or dynamic.51 To get further insight into the phenomena, we measured the excited-state
fluorescence lifetime of the fluorophore (morin) with increasing concentrations
of the quencher, Pb2+ (Figure 1d). It is well-known that in the case of
dynamic quenching, the fluorescence lifetime decreases with increasing
concentrations.51 However, in this case,
no change in fluorescence lifetime (Table 1) was observed, which clearly specifies the
quenching mechanism to be static. This was further supported by the
calculation of the bimolecular quenching constant, kq (Ksv/τ0), which was found to be ∼7.69 × 1012 M–1 s–1 higher than that of diffusion-controlled
limit (∼1010 M–1 s–1).51 This along with no change in fluorescence
lifetime indicates ground-state complex formation between Pb2+ and morin (association constant, Ka = Ksv = 1.819 × 104 M–1, similar to that found in the absorbance experiment). Probably,
binding of Pb2+ to the carbonyl and 3-OH groups of the
pyrone ring inhibits the intramolecular proton transfer, resulting
in the formation of a nonemissive or low-emission phototautomer at
RT.50 Thus, it can be inferred from optical
spectroscopic studies that morin acted as a bidentate ligand and formed
a mononuclear complex with Pb2+, where one ion is bound
to two ligands (Figure 2).

Interaction of Morin with Pb2+ in the Presence of
Other Flavonoid Naringin and Polyphenol EA
Generally, in
natural products, flavonoids never stay as a single entity, rather
as a mixture of flavonoids and other polyphenols. Therefore, we prepared
an equimolar mixture of morin, naringin (a flavonoid glycoside; Figure S1a), and EA (an ellagotannin; Figure S2a) to see whether the blending exerts
any effect on heavy-metal binding property. Naringin and EA were selected
as representatives of two different classes of polyphenols commonly
found in natural products. Figure 3a shows the absorbance spectra of the mixture (we call
it MNEA). Addition
of Pb2+ to MNEA caused minimal or no change in absorbance.
However, in fluorescence studies (Figure 3b), quenching phenomena was clearly evident
at both λex = 450 (probably originating from EA)
and λex = 550 nm (a tail probably originating from
morin). Positive deviation of F0/F from linearity indicates the possible involvement of combined
static and dynamic quenching. The Stern–Volmer constant for
both types of quenching can be determined from equation (eq 2) 2  where KD is the
dynamic quenching constant and KS is the
static quenching constant. The double logarithmic plot (Figure 3b, inset) reveals the association
constant (Ka = 3.16 × 104 M–1) and number of binding sites (n = 1.25) using the following equation (eq 3). 3  where Ka is the
association constant and n is the number of possible binding sites.
The decrease in lifetime, as observed in TCSPC (Table 1), also supports our conjecture. The ground-state
complex formation between morin and Pb2+, observed in the
earlier section of this study, is primarily responsible for the static
part of the observed quenching phenomena. To find out the origin of
the dynamic quenching component, we further investigated the interaction
of Pb2+ with the other two compounds in the mixture.

In the case of naringin (Figure S2a),
as there was observable changes in the absorbance at λex (375 nm) or λem (500 nm) (Figure S2b), we employed inner filter effect correction using the
following equation (eq 4) 4  where Fobs is
the observed fluorescence intensity, Fcorr is the corrected fluorescence intensity after correction of inner
filter effect, dex and dem are the path lengths in the excitation and emission
detection (in cm), respectively, and Aex and Aem are the detected changes in
the absorbance value at the excitation and emission wavelengths, respectively,
caused by ligand addition.51,52 The Stern–Volmer
plot (Figure S2d) constructed using the
corrected fluorescence intensities showed linearity. The significant
change in the lifetime (Table 1) describes the quenching process to be dynamic in nature.
For EA (Figure S3a) also, the inner filter
correction was employed because of the presence of significant change
in absorbance (Figure S3b). Addition of
Pb2+ in the solution caused quenching of the fluorescence
(Figure S3c) and the Stern–Volmer
plot showed an upward curvature without any dependence onto [Pb2+] (Figure S3d). Thus, neither
simple dynamic (linear F0/F, vs [Pb2+]) nor combined static and dynamic (second-degree
polynomial) quenching model was accurately able to describe the data.
Rather, a combined “sphere of action” dynamic quenching
model was helpful. This includes, by means of a Poisson distribution,
the probability that a Pb2+ ion is close enough to instantaneously
quench the fluorescent species.51 This
deviation from linear Stern–Volmer behavior is plausible for
species such as Pb(II), where strong Coulombic interactions are likely
to occur between the excited state and the quenching ion.53 This could further be supported from the time-resolved
studies (Figure S3e), which shows a decrease
in lifetime of the fluorophore (Table 1). The functional form of the quenching model is 5  

The constants KD and Ke were found
by nonlinear least-squares regression of
the data. The dashed line in Figure S2d represents this model equation with the above empirical constants.
Therefore, it can be concluded that the excited-state interaction
between naringin–Pb(II) and EA–Pb(II) is responsible
for the observed dynamic quenching component of MNEA–Pb(II)
interaction. In order to investigate the mutual interaction among
flavonoids and polyphenols, we have performed spectroscopic studies
on the mixture. Although morin–naringin or naringin–EA
shows insignificant changes in the steady-state emission and absorption
spectroscopic data, mixing of morin with EA resulted in spectroscopic
changes as shown in Figure S4a. The steady-state
fluorescence spectra reveal the quenching at 550 nm with a subsequent
increase at 450 nm with an iso-emissive point at 500 nm (Figure S4b). The Stern–Volmer plot (Figure S4b, inset) indicated the presence of
a single type of quenching, which is found to be static in nature
as fluorescence lifetime remained unchanged (Figure S4c). Thus, the flavonoids even in the presence of other polyphenols
can effectively bind heavy metals and increase the detoxification
possibility inside the body. The other polyphenols do not hamper the
detoxification procedure rather shows a synergistic effect by chelating
the heavy metal. In this process, as many of the polyphenols are potential
Pb chelators, competition for metal complexation might occur between
these natural chelators, resulting in synergistic effect.

Interaction
of Flavonoids with Heavy Metal (Pb2+)
in Real-Life Sample, SKP17LIV01
Next, we proceed to a more
complex mixture of flavonoids and polyphenols, SKP17LIV01 (total phenolic
content = 4.71 × 10–3 M; total flavonoid content
= 3.97 × 10–3 M; morin = 2.9%, naringin = 1.2%,
and EA = 1.8%). The mixture was completely characterized by UHPLC–MS
(Figure 4). A summary
of the results are described in the Supporting Information Datasheet SD1 and SD2. A detailed characterization
and computational pharmacological analysis of the mixture are beyond
the scope of this study and will be published elsewhere. Although
it is hard to draw any conclusion from a mixture of ∼100 polyphenols
either by absorption or by emission, still we tried to find observable
change (if any). In brief, the absorbance spectra of SKP17LIV01 show
no or minimal changes upon gradual addition of Pb2+ (Figure 5a). However, in steady-state
fluorescence spectra, quenching was observed (Figure 5b). The Stern–Volmer plot (Figure 5b, inset) suggests
the presence of a single type of quenching, which is static in nature,
as is also found from time-resolved studies (Figure 5c and Table 1). This is further supported by the calculation of
the bimolecular quenching constant, kq (Ksv/τ0), which is
found to be ∼4.81 × 1012 M–1 s–1 and higher than that of diffusion-controlled
limit (∼1010 M–1 s–1).51 The association constant (Ka) of SKP17LIV01 with Pb is found to be, Ka = 4.26 × 104 M–1. It has to be noted that the mixture (SKP17LIV01) of flavonoids
and lots of other polyphenols is able to retain the heavy-metal binding
activity of constituent molecules. For the ease of extraction from
medicinal plants, low cost, and efficient metal binding, the mixture
is more attractive as a therapeutic agent than the individual compounds
like morin or naringin.

Effect on Antioxidant Property
of the Flavonoids after Heavy-Metal
(Pb2+) Chelation
Several studies suggested that
polyphenols have a number of potential health benefits due, in part,
to their antioxidant activity.8,16,43,54,55 Even in the case of heavy-metal toxicity, this property is vital
along with chelation, as this would help to make the healing faster.
Whether the flavonoid will retain the antioxidant property even after
heavy-metal chelation was the major question. Therefore, we evaluated
the antioxidant activity of model flavonoid, morin, before and after
Pb(II) chelation using the DPPH assay. Figure 6a shows that morin was able to retain its
free-radical scavenging activity even after Pb(II) chelation. The
reaction between morin and DPPH occurs in two steps: (i) DPPH absorbance
(λmax = 535 nm in methanol) decays quickly (typical
time, 60–120 s) and (ii) DPPH absorbance decays slowly in ∼1
h to reach a constant value. The fast step essentially refers to the
abstractions of the most labile H-atom from the antioxidant (3-OH
in the case of morin),43,56 whereas the slow step reflects
the remaining activity in the oxidation–degradation products.
Binding of Pb2+ to morin slows down the process. The possible
cause for this compromised free-radical scavenging activity may be
the binding of Pb2+ to the 3-OH of morin that results in
abrogation in coplanarity and conjugation of the molecule. Previous
studies have shown that planarity permits conjugation, electron dislocation,
and a corresponding increase in the flavonoid phenoxyl radical stability.57,58 We further studied the recyclability of the compounds in DPPH radical
scavenging (Figure 6b–d). Interestingly, although morin scavenged the free radical
very fast in the first cycle, it failed in successive cycles. In contrast,
Pb2+–morin complex was able to sustainably scavenge
free radicals up to three cycles. The EC50 value of Pb2+–morin complex remained almost the same as morin (Figure 6e), which further
signifies the retention of antiradical activity even after heavy-metal
chelation. This comes with an increase in the solubility of the chelate
in aqueous media than that of free morin (Figure S5). It may be one of the causes of sustainable antioxidant
activity of the chelate. The increased solubility is also important
in quick removal of the heavy metal from the body. Similar results
of sustainable antioxidant activity after Pb chelation were also obtained
in the case of MNEA and SKP17LIV01 (data not shown). Thus, the metal
chelation imparted sustainability to the flavonoid as well as flavonoid–polyphenol
mixtures in their antioxidant activity, leading to higher therapeutic
efficacy.

Effect of SKP17LIV01, Real-Life
Complex Flavonoid and Polyphenol
Mixture, on in Vivo Mouse Model of Pb Toxicity
Diverse chemical
assays have been developed with an aim to mimic the actual situation
in human body. However, chemical models can be realistic assumptions
only if a positive correlation between chemical and biological models
is established. Therefore, we used an animal (Pb-intoxicated Swiss
albino mouse) model that perfectly mimics the pathogenicity of heavy-metal-associated
disorders, involving a complexity of physiological, immunological,
environmental, and genetic phenomena. Pb intoxication causes severe
damage to multiple organs leading to morbidity and mortality. According
to many preceding studies, liver is one of the major target organs
of Pb(II) toxicity.54,59,60Figure 7a shows the
morphometric conditions of the isolated livers of different groups.
Even from outside, there are visible damages to the liver isolated
from Pb(NO3)2-treated mice. Absence of such
signs in other groups indicates the healing effect of SKP17LIV01 as
well as silymarin, the conventional drug. The observed enlargement
of liver (∼54% increase in liver weight to BW ratio compared
to control; p < 0.05) in pathophysiological situation
(Figure 7b) is well
in agreement with previous studies.60 Increased
proliferation of hepatocytes along with surge in cholesterol synthesis
has been found to be associated with such hyperplastic effect of Pb
on liver.60 Treatment with SKP17LIV01 reduced
the relative liver weight (∼30% compared to group II; p < 0.05) to normal. One of the major ways Pb exerts
its toxicity is through affecting the hematopoietic system by inhibition
of ALAD. The activity of blood ALAD reduced significantly (2.1 ±
0.4 compared to 6.2 ± 0.8 nmol min–1 mL–1 erythrocytes of control; p <
0.001) in animals exposed to Pb (Figure 6c). The inhibition of ALAD was significantly
less in animals administered with SKP17LIV01 (group III; 5.2 ±
0.8 nmol min–1 mL–1 erythrocytes)
and silymarin (group IV; 4.8 ± 0.8 nmol min–1 mL–1 erythrocytes). Treatment after Pb exposure
with SKP17LIV01 was most effective in reversing blood ALAD inhibition
(p < 0.05 compared to silymarin).

features distinct in the Pb(II)-treated group. (g) Necroinflammatory
score and HAI. All data are presented as mean ± SD (*P < 0.05 compared to control, **P <
0.05 compared to Pb(II)-intoxicated group).

Serum aminotransferase activities have long been considered
as
sensitive indicators of hepatic injury.61,62 Injury to
the hepatocytes alters their transport function and membrane permeability,
leading to leakage of enzymes from the cells.63 As shown in Figure 6d, 4 weeks of Pb treatment increased the AST and ALT levels by 4.7-fold
and 2.6-fold, respectively, compared to control (p < 0.001). This significant release of AST and ALT into the circulation
indicates severe damage to hepatic tissue membranes due to chronic
Pb exposure. Treatment with SKP17LIV01 produced dose-dependent reduction
in AST and ALT levels (Table S3). In the
final standardized dose, SKP17LIV01 was able to reduce the AST and
ALT levels by 75 and 70%, respectively, compared to the Pb-intoxicated
group (p < 0.001). Previous studies suggest that
returning of aminotransferase levels to normalcy is associated with
the healing of liver parenchyma and regeneration of hepatocytes.63 There was also surges in other liver function
parameters such as ALP (∼66%), GGT (∼120%), total bilirubin
(∼320%), direct bilirubin (∼135%), and marked decrease
in TP concentration (∼50%) in Pb-treated group (p < 0.001 compared to the normal ones). Treatment with SKP17LIV01
recovers all the parameters to normal levels (Figure 7b).

As described in Figure 6e, Pb(NO3)2 exposure increased Pb levels
both in the blood and liver of mice (17.34 ± 0.91 μg mL–1 and 42.63 ± 2.1 μg g–1, respectively) compared to control (0.13 ± 0.09 μg mL–1 and 0.58 ± 0.11 μg g–1, respectively; p < 0.001). We hereby found that
SKP17LIV01 significantly decreased Pb in the blood and liver (1.69
± 0.05 μg mL–1 and 2.58 ± 0.2 μg
g–1, respectively; p < 0.001).
This is consistent with our in vitro spectroscopic studies, where
the ability of SKP17LIV01 to chelate Pb2+ is found. The
microscopic images of H & E-stained liver sections are depicted
in Figure 7f. The control
group (group I) showed normal hepatocytes and nuclei where the hepatic
lobules are hexagonal, clearly distinguishable, separated by interlobular
septa, and traversed by portal veins. In Pb-treated animals, the remarkable
degenerative histological changes of liver, such as structural damage,
disorganization of hepatic chords, cytoplasmic vacuolation, hepatocellular
necrosis, leukocyte infiltration, and massive hemorrhage had been
observed.64 The SKP17LIV01-treated Pb intoxicated
mice (group III) showed almost normal hepatocytes with a mild degree
of mononuclear infiltration and necrosis, almost comparable to the
control. The significant tissue damage induced by Pb(NO3)2 intoxication might be attributed to its ability to
generate ROS that induce oxidative damage in several tissues by enhancing
lipid peroxidation.59 Also, the degradative
effect of Pb on cellular enzymes, particularly those associated with
energy production, leads to hydropic degeneration of mitochondria
and causes cytoplasmic vacuolization.65 We applied modified Ishak and METAVIR histological activity index
(HAI) (Figure 7g) to
assess the necroinflammatory damage caused by Pb(II). The Pb-intoxicated
animals scored 15 and 3 (the maximum possible score is 16 and 3),
where SKP17LIV01 treatment decreased it to 3 and 0. Thus, as evident
from the microscopic images, SKP17LIV01 is able to protect and preserve
the normal liver structure even better than conventional drug silymarin.

The circulatory system is one of the target organs of Pb toxicity.66 The results concerning hematological parameters
(Table S4) showed a significant (p < 0.001) decline in total erythrocyte count, total
leukocyte count, Hb concentration, lymphocyte, and monocyte content
in the Pb(NO3)2-treated animals (group II),
in comparison to control animals (p < 0.05), whereas
neutrophil content insignificantly increased in Pb(NO3)2-treated group, when compared with control animals (p < 0.05). Recovery of the above-mentioned parameters
is observed in the SKP17LIV01-treated group.

Mechanism Behind the in
Vivo Protective Effect of SKP17LIV01
Against Pb Toxicity
A number of in vitro and in vivo studies
indicated that Pb causes oxidative stress by inducing the generation
of ROS, including hydroperoxides, singlet oxygen, hydrogen peroxide,
and superoxide. It has also been observed that Pb can decrease antioxidant
enzymatic activity in liver.54 In the present
study, the increase in hepatic ROS production manifested in the depletion
of SOD, CAT, and GPx levels, the major enzyme triad responsible for
scavenging of free radicals inside the body. To be particular, SOD
converts superoxide anions to H2O2, which is
further converted to H2O with the help of GPx and CAT.67 In this study, 4 weeks of chronic Pb exposure
decreased these enzyme levels by 63, 57, and 45%, respectively, compared
to control group (p < 0.05) and caused severe
oxidative damage to the liver cells. However, treatment with SKP17LIV01
helped the Pb-intoxicated mice to replenish their antioxidant enzyme
system to normal (increase in SOD ∼132%, CAT ∼115%,
and GPx ∼50%; p < 0.05 in all cases) (Figure 8a,b).

action of SKP17LIV01 through redox modulatory
activity. (a) Effect on cellular antioxidant system. (b) Schematic
representation of the mechanism of action of SKP17LIV01 on antioxidant

All data are presented as mean ± SD (*P <
0.05 compared to control, **P < 0.05 compared
to Pb(II)-intoxicated group).

Thiol-based antioxidant system plays second line of cellular
protection
against reactive free-radical-mediated oxidative damage in pathophysiological
situation.54 Cellular metabolite such as
GSH has been presented in Figure 8a. The level of GSH has been considerably decreased
because of intoxication along with the increased level of oxidized
glutathione. Post-treatment with SKP17LIV01 after the Pb(II) exposure
restored the levels of cellular metabolites close to normal, demonstrating
its protective nature. Figure 8b provides a schematic overview of the proposed mechanism
of action of SKP17LIV01 in the protection of oxidative stress induced
by Pb. The model clearly indicates that SKP17LIV01, despite direct
sustainable free-radical scavenging activity, boosts the in vivo enzymatic
antioxidant defense system resulting in protection from increased
levels of ROS. The model is further supported by the observations
of lipid peroxidation and protein carbonylation, the two important
markers of oxidative stress. The increase in the MDA level (Figure 8c) in the serum and
liver (∼3.8 fold compared to control in both cases, p < 0.01) upon Pb(NO3)2 treatment
suggests enhanced peroxidation, leading to tissue damage and failure
of antioxidant mechanism to prevent the formation of excessive free
radicals. Post-treatment with SKP17LIV01 (Pb(NO3)2 + SKP17LIV01) significantly attenuated these changes (decrease in
MDA level by ∼1.8-folds (liver) and ∼1.5-folds (serum)
compared to PbNO3-treated group, p <
0.05 in all cases). The flavonoids and polyphenols exert their antioxidant
effects in the body by preventing the generation of ROS, direct scavenging
of it, or through enhancement of cellular antioxidant system. Thus,
the observed recovery of antioxidant enzyme pool in the animal model
of Pb intoxication after the administration of SKP17LIV01 is the consequence
of synergistic activity between its various phytoconstituents as evident
from our spectroscopic studies. The flavonoids may have played a crucial
role in the reduction of the treatment period by controlling the accumulation
and bioavailability of Pb(II) in the tissue through complexation,
subsequent sustainable antioxidant activity, and removal.

Conclusions
The disaster due to Pb poisoning is evident from the ancient human
civilization till date, although it is concluded to be preventable.
Understanding the mechanism of Pb detoxification by low-cost medicinally
important molecules and cost-effective herbal mixture is very important
for the promotion of lots of folk medicines in developing countries.
Here, we have explored the detailed mechanism of Pb detoxification
by morin, a model flavonoid, which is omnipresent in medicinal herbs
using steady-state and picosecond-resolved optical spectroscopy. We
have shown that Pb–morin chelate becomes a sustainable antioxidant
revealing dual role of the flavonoid in the heavy-metal detoxification
process. Our spectroscopic studies also reveal that the dual nature
in the detoxification remains intact in the controlled mixture of
few flavonoid and polyphenol molecules (MNEA), and even in a mixture,
many such molecules were extracted from medicinal plants (SKP17LIV01).
We have studied the efficacy of the complex mixture in the mouse model
for the detoxification of Pb poisoning in detail. Subsequent, biochemical,
histopathological, and biodistribution studies confirm that the molecular
mixture (SKP17LIV01) facilitates excretion of Pb from the mammal (mice)
body after heavy-metal chelation and ROS scavenging. The study is
expected to have an impact in the discovery of new drugs of ethnobotanical
origin.
