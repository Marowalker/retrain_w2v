β-Glucosidase (EC 3.2.1.21)
plays an essential role in the
removal of glycosyl residues from disaccharide cellobiose to produce
glucose during the hydrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass. Although
there exist a few β-glucosidase that are tolerant to large concentrations
of glucose, these enzymes are typically prone to glucose inhibition.
Understanding the basis of this inhibition is important for the production
of cheaper biofuels from lignocellulose. In this study, all-atom molecular dynamics simulation at different temperatures and
glucose concentrations was used to understand the molecular basis
of glucose inhibition of GH1 β-glucosidase (B8CYA8) from Halothermothrix orenii. Our results show that glucose
induces a broadening of the active site tunnel through residues lining
the tunnel and facilitates the accumulation of glucose. In particular,
we observed that glucose accumulates at the tunnel entrance and near
the catalytic sites to block substrate accessibility and inhibit enzyme
activity. The reduction of enzyme activity was also confirmed experimentally
through specific activity measurements in the presence of 0–2.5
M glucose. We also show that the increase in glucose concentrations
leads to a decrease in the number of water molecules inside the tunnel
to affect substrate hydrolysis. Overall, the results help in understanding
the role of residues along the active site tunnel for the engineering
of glucose-tolerant β-glucosidase.

==== Body
1 Introduction
The
production of biofuels from lignocellulosic biomass could be
broadly divided into three steps—pretreatment of the biomass
to reduce cellulose recalcitrance, enzymatic conversion of the polysaccharides
in pretreated biomass to sugars, and the conversion of the sugars
to fuels by the same or other microbes through fermentative processes.
A group of enzymes, known as cellulase, break down the polysaccharides
into sugars.1,2 These enzymes work synergistically
to hydrolyze the biomass and are made up of the minimum set of endoglucanase,
cellobiohydrolase, and β-glucosidase. Endoglucanase (EC 3.2.1.4)
randomly cleave the β-1,4 glycosidic linkages of cellulose,
cellobiohydrolase (EC 3.2.1.91) attack the cellulose chain ends to
produce a dimer of glucose called cellobiose, which is linked by a
β-1,4 glycosidic bond. β-Glucosidase (EC 3.2.1.21) hydrolyze
the β-1,4 linkage in cellobiose to produce glucose.3−6 The final hydrolysis step is generally recognized as a limiting
step in the conversion of lignocellulosic biomass to sugars as β-glucosidase
are inhibited by its reaction product glucose.4,6,7 The efficient and economic hydrolysis by
cellulase requires enzymes that are also active in high glucose concentrations.
Understanding the basis of glucose inhibition and engineering toward
relieving this product inhibition is, therefore, a major challenge.

Whereas the typical inhibition constant (Ki,app) of glucose on the β-glucosidase chromogenic substrate, p-nitrophenyl-β-d-glucoside (pNPGlc), is less than 50 mM, recently there have been reports of bacterial
β-glucosidase that are either not inhibited by glucose or are
stimulated in the presence of glucose.6,8,9 Thus, there exists a large difference in glucose
inhibition amongst β-glucosidase. Though the molecular mechanism
of glucose inhibition or tolerance is not well understood, experimental
studies of glucose-tolerant β-glucosidase have attributed tolerance
to narrower and deeper active site tunnels, specific residues in the
tunnel, and the presence of allosteric sites on these enzymes.10−12 Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation is an important tool to characterize
structural dynamics, flexibility, and mechanism of enzymes and help
gain deeper insights into the structure–function relationship.13−16 Computational modeling and MD simulation have been reported toward
understanding catalytic activity and thermostability of cellulases.15,17−23 However, there are no reports of theoretical studies for a molecular-level
understanding of β-glucosidase inhibition or the effect of glucose
on the structural stability of such enzymes.

As part of a program
to understand how the β-glucosidase
reaction product, glucose, interacts with the enzyme, we have been
studying the effects of glucose on β-glucosidase across mesophilic
and thermophilic organisms.6,9,24 One such enzyme is the highly active and thermostable GH1 β-glucosidase
(B8CYA8) from Halothermothrix orenii.24,25 The higher stability of this enzyme has
been shown to be a promising target toward industrial applications.26 In the present work, we report the effect of
glucose on B8CYA8 activity and employed MD simulations to investigate
the influence of glucose on B8CYA8 activity and stability. In order
to understand the effect of different concentrations of glucose on
protein structure and activity, we computed the root mean square deviation
(rmsd) of amino acids, root mean square fluctuations (RMSFs) of Cα atoms, radial distribution functions, and distance
distribution between the selected pair at different temperatures.
The MD studies provide us a way to understand the basis of B8CYA8
glucose inhibition of catalytic activity at high glucose concentrations.

2 Methods
2.1 Protein Expression, Purification,
and Assay
The synthetic gene corresponding to the β-glucosidase
from H. orenii was constructed (BankIt1930137BG_Halotherm
KU867899) as reported previously and expressed in Escherichia
coli Top 10F′ cells (Life Technologies, La
Jolla, CA).24 B8CYA8 was purified using
a protocol detailed earlier and purity was confirmed by 10% sodium
dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.24 The specific activity of enzymes in the presence of glucose
was determined on the substrate p-nitrophenyl β-d-glucopyranoside (pNPGlc) after incubation in the buffer containing different concentrations
of glucose under optimum conditions.

2.2 Computational
Methodology and Simulation Details
The X-ray crystallographic
structure of the β-glucosidase
was obtained from the protein data bank (PDB ID: 4PTX).25 At first, the energy-minimized protein molecule (B8CYA8)
was kept at the center of a cubic simulation box 120 Å long and
then solvated with water. We used the TIP3P water model in all of
our simulations.27 We added glucose molecules
by using PACKMOL28 to obtain the following
desired glucose concentration, Xglu of
0, 0.2, 0.5, 1.5, and 2.0 M. All the potential parameters were obtained
from the CHARMM36 force field. The simulations were performed by NAMD-2.9
simulation tools.29−32 By taking initial configurations at different Xglu, the conjugate gradient method was applied for 300 000
steps to remove all the energetically unfavorable contacts. Three
different temperatures were chosen to represent the room temperature
(300 K), high catalytic activity (335 K), and maximum temperatures
at which any catalytic activity could be measured (375 K). We have
also performed simulation at 450 K at which the protein is denatured
(450 K). The starting configurations were equilibrated for 3.0 ns
in the NPT ensemble to fix the simulation box length.
In NPT simulations, Nose–Hoover thermostat
and barostat coupling constants were taken to be 0.5 and 2.0 ps, respectively.33,34 The pressure was kept constant at 1.0 atm. After the simulation
box length was fixed, we equilibrated the system for 5.0 ns in the NVT ensemble. To analyze different properties of the system,
a production run of 50 ns was performed in the NVT ensemble for all cases. At 335 K, a production run of 100 ns was
also performed for all glucose concentrations and at 300 and 375 K,
a longer production run was performed for 0.5, 1.5, and 2.0 M glucose
concentrations to check the validity of the production run up to 50
ns. We observed that there were no qualitative differences in the
results for 50 and 100 ns production runs. The temperature of the
systems was kept constant at the respective temperature by using the
damping coefficient (γ) of 1.0 ps–1 by Langevin
dynamics. Long-range interactions are handled by the particle mesh
Ewald method,35−37 with real space cut-off of 16 and 2 Å pair-list
cut-off. We used a scaling factor of 1–4 in all our simulations.
The time step was of 1.0 fs and all the properties were computed from
the trajectories stored at an interval of 4.0 ps during the production
run.

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Validation
of the Forcefield
We determined
the rmsd of the energy-minimized B8CYA8 backbone at 300, 335, 375,
and 475 K in the absence of glucose. Figure 1a shows that up to 50 ns, rmsd is less than
2.5 Å for temperatures up to 375 K. However, above 375 K, rmsd
increased drastically, suggesting a temperature-induced denaturation
of B8CYA8. This agreed well with the experimentally determined unfolding
temperature of this protein24 and proved
that the force field used in this study was capable of reproducing
the experimentally observed stability of B8CYA8. Figure 1b shows the root-mean-square
fluctuation (RMSF) of each amino acid residue at different temperatures.
Up to 375 K, the residues have a maximum RMSF of less than 3.5 Å.
However, at 475 K the RMSF of many B8CYA8 residues are more than 5.0
Å and indicates protein denaturation at that temperature.38 As the experimental data indicated that B8CYA8
displays maximum activity at 335 K and denatures at temperature close
to 375 K, we will hereafter restrict our discussions to enzyme behavior
at 300, 335, and 375 K.

in the absence of
glucose at 300, 335, 375, and 450 K.

3.2 Structural Changes of B8CYA8 in the Presence
of Glucose
The B8CYA8 crystal structure indicates the presence
of a TIM barrel with a (α/β)8 fold and the
active site located deep inside a tunnel.27 This enzyme active site tunnel is made up of catalytic residues
E354 and E166 located at the glycone-binding site at the bottom of
the tunnel, aglycone-binding site located toward the middle of the
tunnel, and gatekeeper residues at the edge of the active site tunnel
near the tunnel opening. The aglycone-binding site contains a diverse
combination of residues and generally forms hydrophobic interactions
as well as water-mediated H-bonds with the substrate.39 The glycone-binding sites contain a highly conserved combination
of residues that can also form H-bonds with the substrate. Thus, the
amino acids in the active site tunnel are thought to play an important
role in β-glucosidase activity and glucose tolerance.39−44 The B8CYA8 glycone, aglycone, and gatekeeper residues are listed
in Table S1.

In order to understand
any structural changes caused by the reaction product glucose at different
regions of the enzyme including the active site tunnel, we started
by computing the rmsd of the B8CYA8 backbone in the presence of glucose. Figure 2a–c shows
rmsd at 300, 335, and 375 K, respectively, in the presence of different
concentrations of glucose. At 300 K, the rmsd is nearly independent
of glucose concentrations. However, at 335 and 375 K subtle rmsd variations
were observed across different glucose concentrations. To better understand
the gross structural changes, we computed average rmsd (rmsdavg) from the last 20 ns production runs at different temperatures and
glucose concentrations (Table 1). The columns under temperatures in Table 1 represent average rmsd. At 335 and 375 K,
the rmsdavg of B8CYA8 increases at high glucose concentrations
with a maximum rmsdavg of 3.51 Å. This suggests structural
changes in B8CYA8 up to 375 K, when the protein remains folded. To
visualize these structural changes, we took the last configuration
of the enzyme from each simulation and aligned the backbone Cα atoms. Figure S1A–E shows the last B8CYA8 structure from each MD run at 335 K and Figure 3 shows their aligned
structures.

dotted circles in the figure indicate the region (324, 325, 410, and
411 in the gatekeeper region and residue 415 at the glycone-binding
site) where structural changes occur in the presence of glucose.

Significant structural changes at
residues 324, 325, 410, and 411
in the gatekeeper region and residue 415 at the glycone-binding site
in the active site tunnel were observed and are shown in the region
within black dotted circles in Figure 3. It has been previously reported that residues in
the glycone-binding and gatekeeper region may play an important role
in the activity of B8CYA8.27 Thus, the
residues causing structural changes in the presence of glucose may
also have a significant effect on B8CYA8 activity.

To further
pinpoint the structural changes of all the residues,
we first computed RMSF as a function of glucose concentration (Xglu). Figure 4a–c shows RMSF at T = 300,
335, and 375 K, respectively, in the presence of 0–2.0 M glucose.
RMSF is mostly invariant with glucose concentration, except for the
residues in the active site tunnel region. As structural changes around
the catalytic sites (E354 and E166) are expected to play an important
role in regulating protein activity, we zoomed Figure 4a–c to highlight the RMSF of residues
between 160–170 and residues 350–360 containing the
catalytic residues E166 and E354, respectively. These regions are
shown in Figure 4d–f,g–i,
respectively, with the RMSF measured at three different temperatures.
We observed small changes in RMSF near the catalytic site residues
in the presence of glucose. Previous reports in the literature implicate
specific regions around the active site tunnel like a loop region,
gatekeeper region, glycone-binding site residues, and aglycone-binding
site to play an important role in regulating protein activity.27,39−44 We therefore zoomed Figure 4a–c to show RMSF of amino acid in the loop region (303–308),
gatekeeper region (residues 314, 316, 324, 325, 326, 410, and 411),
glycone-binding site (residues 401, 406, 408, 409, 415, and 417) and
aglycone-binding site (327) in Figure 5a–f. We observed that RMSFs of all these residues
are significantly altered in the presence of glucose. Fluctuations
of these residues in the presence of glucose may affect substrate
binding and lower enzyme activity. Indeed, the reduction of enzyme
activity was confirmed upon experimental determination of B8CYA8 specific
activity in the presence of 0–2.5 M glucose (Figure 6). Ongoing experimental studies
have confirmed some of these results. For example, W327R mutant activity
decreases sixfold compared to the wild-type enzyme (data not shown).

all B8CYA8 residues at T = (a) 300, (b)

activity of
B8CYA8 at 343 K on the substrate pNPGlc. Maximum
fluctuation in the error bar is ∼15% of the specific activity.

To further confirm that the fluctuations
of the abovementioned
amino acid residues are due to glucose, we computed the radial distribution
function [g(r)], where r represents the distance between glucose and the solvent-exposed
amino acid residue of the protein that can interact with glucose.
We chose those solvent-exposed residues based on the maximum change
in RMSF with Xglu and compared with the
residues where there were no changes in the presence of glucose. At
300 K, we chose D307 and at 335 and 375 K, we chose E318 as these
residues showed the maximum RMSF. We chose L309 as RMSF for this residue
did not vary with glucose concentration. We measured g(r) between OH1 (see Figure S2a) of glucose, which can form hydrogen bonds with
the protein, and Oδ1, Oε1, and Hδ12 of D307, E318, and L309, respectively (atom notations are
defined in Figure S2b–d). Figure 7a–d,e–h,i–l
shows g(r) at 300, 335, and 375
K, respectively, in the presence of different concentrations of glucose.
At large distances, g(r) at different
glucose concentrations do not tend to 1 (one) because the bulk density
of glucose is different. At all temperatures when r ≤ 5.0 Å, we observed multiple distinct peaks in Oδ1–OH1 and Oε1–OH1g(r), whereas no such peak
was observed for Hδ12–OH1g(r). The peak heights indicate that glucose
accumulation near D307 and E318 is large as compared to L309. Other
such chosen pairs also show similar results and confirm that the fluctuations
of amino acid residues are indeed due to the presence of glucose.
The relatively larger peak heights suggest that the amino acids with
large RMSF interacts favorably with glucose. Moreover, glucose approaches
closer to D307 and E318 (r ≤ 2.4 Å) than
L309 at all temperatures and concentrations studied, suggesting the
possibility of hydrogen bond interaction with D307 and E318. As the
glucose concentration increases from 0.2 to 2.0 M, the peak height
in g(r) mostly decreases because
of the finite number of glucose molecules that can be accommodated
within the steric limits imposed by D307 and E318 in the active site
tunnel.

glucose (OH1 atom)—D307 (Oδ1 atom)

3.2.1 Broadening of the Active Site Tunnel Because
of Glucose
Enzyme activity typically depends on the concentration
of solvent and substrate molecules near the active site residues.
As the catalytic site in B8CYA8 is located at the bottom of the active
site tunnel, the sterics of the tunnel entrance may affect the accessibility
of substrate and solvent at the catalytic site. To measure any changes
in the diameter of the active site tunnel, we measured the distances
between different pairs of residues such as N308–A410, D307–A410,
Y411–K316, and A410–V314 located nearly opposite to
each other at the gatekeeper region near the tunnel entrance [Figure 8a]. We computed the
distance distribution [P(R)], where R is the distance between the center of mass (c. o. m.)
of the chosen residue pairs. The P(R) at 300, 335, and 375 K for the four pairs of residues are shown
in Figures S3–S5, respectively. R varied up to 7.0 Å at 300, 335, and 375 K. Though R varies randomly with glucose concentrations at 300 K,
the R increases with glucose concentrations at 335
and 375 K. In order to obtain the tunnel diameter, we computed the
average distribution of the four chosen pairs of residues, as shown
in Figures S3–S5. The average distributions
at different temperatures are shown in Figure 8b–d. At 300 K, the tunnel diameter
varies with glucose concentration from (19.0 ± 0.2) to (20.1
± 0.4) Å whereas at 335 K, it varies from (22.0 ± 0.2)
to (24.6 ± 0.3) Å. The tunnel diameter at 375 K varies from
(16.5 ± 0.3) to (19.6 ± 0.3) Å. Though there is no
significant change in tunnel diameter at 300 K, the diameter increased
by around 2.6 Å at 335 K for Xglu = 1.5 and 2.0 M than at Xglu = 0–0.5
M, indicating a glucose-induced tunnel broadening. This increase in
tunnel diameter at higher glucose concentrations may facilitate the
accumulation of glucose inside the tunnel and impede substrate access
to the active site. At 375 K, the diameter increased by around ∼2.7
Å for Xglu 2.0 M than at Xglu = 0–0.5 M. This tunnel broadening
occurs randomly at other glucose concentrations because of large fluctuations
of the gatekeeper residues.

blue, and green colors, respectively. The average distance distributions
[P(R)] across these residues were
measured at T = (b) 300, (c) 335, and (d) 375 K,
respectively, for different glucose concentrations.

3.2.2 Accumulation of Glucose
at the Entrance
and inside the Active Site Tunnel
The experimentally observed
inhibition of B8CYA8 activity by glucose [shown in Figure 6] may be caused by the accumulation
of glucose at the gatekeeper region near the tunnel entrance and/or
near the active site. To delineate between these two possibilities,
we measured the number of glucose molecules (Nglucose) as a function of distance from the catalytic sites
[rd] at all the glucose concentrations.
To compute Nglucose, we considered three
hydrogen atoms of glucose, namely HO3, HO4,
and HO6 and oxygen atom (Oε1) of the catalytic
site residues as shown in Figure 9. Figure 10 shows Nglucose as a function
of rd at 335 K at different glucose concentrations.
As the approximate length of the tunnel is 19.0 Å, we restricted rd up to 20 Å. rd = 0 Å represents the location of Oε1 atom
of the two catalytic residues. We observed that at the gatekeeper
region, Nglucose increases significantly
with glucose concentration, in particular at Xglu = 1.5 and 2.0 M. Thus, the accumulation of glucose at the
gatekeeper region probably hinders substrate entry into the tunnel.
We also observed that the distance of closest approach of glucose
to the catalytic residues decreases at high glucose concentrations.
For example, at Xglu = 2.0 M the distance
between Oε1 and hydrogen atoms of glucose is nearly
2.5 Å whereas at 0.2 M, the distance increases to around 7.5
Å. The increased presence of glucose near the active sites at
high glucose concentration competes with substrate binding, hinders
substrate accessibility, and inhibits B8CYA8 activity. At 300 and
375 K (shown in Figures S6 and S7), a similar
trend was observed. Our studies therefore show that the presence of
a high concentration of glucose induces tunnel broadening and glucose
accumulation both at the catalytic site and the tunnel entrance.

and OH6 with the oxygen atom, Oε1, of
the active site residues E166 and E354 of B8CYA8.

Figure 10 (a–c) represent numbers of glucose (Nglucose) as a function of the distance (rd) between different hydroxyl groups of glucose (OH3, OH4, OH6) and the Oε1 of
E166 at 335 K. (d–f) represents represent numbers of glucose
(Nglucose) as a function of rd between the same hydroxyl groups as above and the Oε1 of E354 at 335 K.

3.3 Proton-Donating Capacity of the Active Site
Residues in the Presence of Glucose
It is known that the
catalytic site E166 acts as a proton donor and another catalytic residue
E354 acts as a nucleophile.27 GH1 β
glucosidase are typically hydrolyzed through the well-known retaining
mechanism where E166 is first protonated by neighboring water and
then acts as a proton donor.39 The proton-donating
capacity of the catalytic residues should depend on the aqueous environment
adjacent to the catalytic site. We, therefore, computed the average
number of water molecules (Nwater) in
the tunnel within 3.5 Å from the Oε1 atom of
E166. Figure 11 shows Nwater at 335 K for different glucose concentrations.
It is seen that the number of water molecules adjacent to E166 decreases
significantly. The reduction of Nwater near E166 with glucose
concentration may be due to increased accumulation of glucose near
the catalytic site (see Figure 10) at a high glucose concentration. The fewer number
of water molecules at high glucose concentrations might decrease the
proton-donating ability of the catalytic site (E166) and/or affect
the release of glucose from the intermediate state by the nucleophilic
water and lead to decrease in specific activity of B8CYA8.

of water molecules (Nwater) in the tunnel

4 Conclusions
MD simulations at different
temperatures and glucose concentrations
assist us in understanding the effect of glucose on B8CYA8 activity.
At high glucose concentrations, we observed significant fluctuations
at residues corresponding to the loop region (303–308), gatekeeper
residues (314, 316, 324, 325, 326, 410, and 411), aglycone-binding
site residue (327), and glycone-binding site residues (401, 406, 408,
409, 415, and 417). The experimentally observed inhibition of B8CYA8
activity in the presence of increasing concentrations of glucose may
be due to the effect of these fluctuations on substrate binding and
enzyme activity. We found an increase in glucose accumulation at the
tunnel entrance and near the active site which may compete with substrate
accessibility and binding to the catalytic site. At 335 K when the
enzyme shows high activity, glucose-induced tunnel broadening was
observed that may further facilitate the accumulation of glucose at
the tunnel entrance. Furthermore, in the vicinity of catalytic residues,
the decrease in the number of water molecules in the presence of glucose
could reduce proton donation to the substrate and inhibit enzyme hydrolytic
activity. Our results implicate the role of the active site tunnel
in maintaining glucose tolerance of B8CYA8 and argues against the
role of any single residue. These results may guide a closer examination
of the β-glucosidase active site tunnel toward understanding
the role of protein–solvent interaction in the regulation of
polysaccharide hydrolysis and engineering of improved enzymes.
