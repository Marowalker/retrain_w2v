The
aliphatic-acid-mediated dehydration of C6–10-α,ω-alkanediols
to alkadienes proceeds in a stepwise
manner: C6–10-α,ω-alkanediols react
with aliphatic acids first to generate diesters; subsequent pyrolysis
of the latter produces alkadienes. The highest yields of 1,5-hexadiene,
1,7-octadiene, and 1,9-decadiene were up to 70.3, 74.8, and 90.3%,
respectively. It turned out that pyrolysis favors the diester with
a longer carbon chain more, while acetic acid outperformed the other
aliphatic acids in the pyrolysis step that a relatively lower temperature
was enough for a high yield of alkadienes.

==== Body
Introduction
Alkadienes play an
important role in chemical research, as they
serve as essential build blocks in synthetic rubbers, co-crosslinkers,
petroleum mixture, and starting materials for macrocycle synthesis.1−6 There exist quite a few methods for preparing alkadienes, such as
dehydration of alkanediol, reductive coupling reaction of halogenated
olefins, catalytic decarboxylation of alkanedioic acid, or Grignard
reaction of halogenated hydrocarbons.7−14 Among all these methods, catalytic dehydration of alkanediol is
the most commonly used one due to several advantages like low cost
of raw materials, short reaction route, convenient post-treatment,
and less pollution. As to the dehydration of alcohol, a series of
organic and inorganic acids can catalyze this process, while some
inorganic materials are capable of this task as well. For example,
acids like sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid, p-toluenesulfonic
acid, and inorganic materials like salts, molecular sieves, solid
superacid, ion exchange resins, are proven to be active.15−19 Acid-catalyzed dehydration of alkanol to alkene is generally accompanied
by the migration of the double bond and the intermolecular and/or
the intramolecular etherification, resulting in an unsatisfactory
selectivity.20

Further, pyrolysis
of esters may also produce olefins, and this
route benefits from less side reactions such as rearrangement and
isomerization.4,21,22 In 1959, Froemsdorf reported the first example of pyrolysis of n-butyl
acetate to 1-butene at 500 °C.23 Up
till now, however, there are only a few reports on the preparation
of alkadiene via the pyrolysis of ester. Herein, we report a novel
approach to continuously pyrolyze diester to alkadiene as performed
in a tubular reactor; furthermore, no catalyst was involved. Several
dienes like 1,5-hexadiene, 1,7-octadiene, and 1,9-decadiene from 1,6-hexanediol,
1,8-octanediol, and 1,10-decanediol, respectively, were obtained in
high yields. Factors such as the lengths of carbon chain and the aliphatic
acid used are discussed regarding their influence on pyrolysis.

Results
and Discussion
Esterification
Water-separation
devices consisting
of a water divider and a condensation tube were used in the synthesis
of diester from alkanediol and organic acid. Toluene, cycloheptane,
and propyl acetate are ideal reagents to form azeotrope with water,
thus removing it from the systems. Thus, toluene was employed as a
water carrier. Excessive acids were used for uncatalyzed esterification.
After esterification, the excessive acid and toluene in the reactor
were recycled via evaporation. To further examine the influence of
acid on the pyrolysis step, 1,10-decanediol was reacted with formic
acid, acetic acid, propionic acid, butyric acid, and isobutyric acid
to prepare the corresponding esters. It turned out that the weaker
the aliphatic acid, harsher the condition required in esterification,
in line with previous findings.24 More
details are shown in Table 1.

acid is 1:4.

Pyrolysis of
Esters
The pyrolysis of esters is actually
an eliminating process. For a general mechanism, the reaction proceeds
according to the coordination mechanism of cyclic transition state,
which features for a cis-elimination in stereochemistry.
The reaction mechanism can be seen in Scheme 1.

Scheme 1 Pyrolytic Elimination
Gaseous species in a tubular reactor usually flows in
a turbulent
form. Assuming that temperature, velocity, or concentration does not
diffuse in the axial direction and there is no radial gradient, the
flow in the tubular reactor can be regarded as plug flow. Thus, different
feed rates only result in different residence times. When the length
and the filling fraction of the reactor are constant, the yield of
the product increases with the decreasing feed rate (or the increasing
residence time) at constant temperature. By adjusting the reaction
temperature and the feed rate of the material, both the target product
alkadiene and the byproduct monoene can be obtained (Scheme 2).

Scheme 2 Pyrolysis Process
of Diester
The quartz Raschig rings with
a filler type of 3 × 7 mm2 were filled into the tubular
reactor to afford a desired
residence time and a uniform radical distribution of temperature;
the filler void fraction was about 0.7. The optimum reaction conditions
as well as the associated results for the pyrolysis of various esters
are shown in Table 2; the selected reactions proceed with good to excellent yields of
alkadienes. Further, the influence of temperature, the acid used,
and the residence time on the pyrolysis processes was investigated
with 1,10-decanediol esters (Figure 1).

(c) 1,10-bis(propionyloxy)decane, and (d) 1,10-bis(isobutyryloxy)decane.

a All of the reactions
are at the
temperature of 450 °C and the flow rate of 15 g/h.

As shown in Figure 1, in general, the weaker the aliphatic acid
used in the esterification,
harsher is the condition required in the pyrolysis process except
for 1,10-dimethyloxydecane; the latter is more prone to dissociate
to 1,10-decanediol and CO by hydrogen transfer from the formaldehyde
moiety to the α-oxygen. Conceivably, the weaker the aliphatic
acid is, lower the electron density located around the carbonyl moiety
is; accordingly, the oxygen of the carbonyl moiety is less favorable
to serve as the hydrogen donor. In addition, a weaker aliphatic acid
used for the ester facilitates a low diene/monoene ratio. Further,
temperature affects the pyrolysis of esters both kinetically and thermochemically
in a concert manner. For example, the higher the reaction temperature,
the faster the reaction proceeds and higher the ratio of diene/monoene
results. An endothermic nature of the pyrolysis processes can thus
be justified. In addition to these general trends, indications can
be found regarding how to tune the product distribution by combining
temperature/aliphatic acid/residence time properly. Thus, if only
the diene product is desired, high temperature/strong acid/long residence
time should be adopted (Figure 1a); if both the diene and the monoene products are wanted
equivalently, the combination high temperature/weak acid/short residence
time is ideal. However, if only the monoene product is the target,
a weak acid can be affirmed first, while the temperature and the residence
time should be selected subtly and specifically for each monoene;
to obtain 9-decen-1-ol, 1-acetate with a relatively high selectivity,
the combination 400 °C/isobutyric acid/(15 g/h) should be used.
Such a delicate selection of the reaction system provides a tactic
for the selective preparation of diene/enol from alkanediols. In fact,
selective monodehydration of alkanediols to enols has been reported
previously by Yamanaka;20 however, palmitic
or stearic acid has to be used.

It should be noted that during
the catalytic cycle, the amount
of acetic acid recycled is always less than the theoretical value.
This is because some of the acetic acid decomposes into ethenone and
water at high temperatures. Similarly, propionic acid, butyric acid,
and isobutyric acid were partially recycled. Under the conditions
of 450 °C and 15 g/h feed rate, the ratio of organic acids recovered
from ester pyrolysis is shown in Table 3. Obviously, the weaker the acid is, the less amount
decomposes in the pyrolysis.

Table 3 Recovery Ratio of
Aliphatic Acids
entry	organic acids	recovery
ratio (%)	
1	formic acid	0	
2	acetic acid	32.7	
3	propionic acid	44.5	
4	butyric acid	62.3	
5	isobutyric acid	65.1	
Finally,
the pyrolysis of another two diacetic esters, 1,8-diacetoxyoctane
and 1,6-diacetoxyhexane, was performed at different temperatures and
feed rates (Figure 2). Generally, 1,7-octadiene and 1,5-hexadiene were also obtained
with high yields. Notably, when the feed rate was reduced to 7.5 g/h,
the yields of 1,8-diacetoxyoctane and 1,6-diacetoxyhexane decreased
as compared to the ones at 15 g/h. This is due to the fact that short-chain
alkadiene is more easily polymerized at high temperatures. Accordingly,
though the yields of 1,9-decadiene, 1,7-octadiene, and 1,5-hexadiene
are similar during 350–400 °C, the yields of 1,9-decadiene
are significant as compared to the other two dienes when the temperature
rises above 400 °C.

1,8-diacetoxyhexane.

Conclusions
In
summary, 1,6-hexanediol, 1,8-octanediol, and 1,10-decanediol
were used as raw materials to prepare 1,5-hexadiene, 1,7-octanediene,
and 1,9-decanediene, respectively, and aliphatic acids were employed
as catalysts. Esterification took place as the preliminary step, which
was followed by the pyrolysis of the so-formed esters to eventually
afford dienes. Upon comparing reactions at different temperatures
and residence times, it was found that a stronger acid performs better
in both the esterification and the pyrolysis processes, while the
length of the carbon chain of the alkanediols does not affect either
the esterification or the pyrolysis much. More importantly, the product
distribution (diene/monoene) can be easily accomplished by properly
combining different temperatures/aliphatic acids/residence times.

Experiment Procedure
Preparation of 1,9-Decadiene
A mixture
of 52.2 g (0.3
mol) of 1,10-decanediol, 72 g (1.2 mol) of acetic acid, and 50 g of
toluene was added to a 500 mL, three-port flask, which is equipped
with a thermometer and a water separator. When the temperature was
elevated to 108 °C, the water generated during the reaction is
removed by a separator. After 6 h of reaction, the remaining acetic
acid and toluene were removed via evaporation at 200 °C to obtain
1,10-diacetoxydecane.

The device of ester pyrolysis is shown
in Figure 3. 1,10-Diacetoxydecane
was placed in container bottle 1. The flow rate was adjusted using
an injection pump 2 and the temperature was adjusted by the transformer
tank 8. The crude 1,9-decadiene was collected from the receiving flask
