The
anionic 5-acetylimidazol-2-ylidene-4-olate 1–, named as “IMes-acac”, is composed of
fused diaminocarbene and acetylacetonato units in the same IMes-based
imidazolyl ring. The bifunctional compound 1– is shown to act as an effective, ditopic bridging ligand for transition
metal centers. Several new complexes supported by this ligand were
prepared, including the complex [RuCl(p-Cym)(κ2O,O–1·H)](BF4) (2), which can be regarded
as a metallated imidazolium salt, the homobimetallic complex [((COD)Rh)(RhCl(COD))(μ-1κ2O,O:2κ1C–1)] (4), the
heterobimetallic complexes [((p-Cym)ClRu)(RhCl(COD))(μ-1κ2O,O:2κ1C–1)] (3), [((p-Cym)ClRu)(RhCl(CO)2)(μ-1κ2O,O:2κ1C–1)] (5), [((p-Cym)ClRu)(Cu(IPr))(μ-1κ2O,O:2κ1C–1)] (9), the anionic homoleptic Cu(I) complexes
[Cu(κ1C–1)2]K ([10]K) and [Cu(κ1C–1)2](NEt4) ([10](NEt4)), and the heterotrimetallic complex [((p-Cym)RuCl)2(Cu)(μ-1κ2O,O:3κ1C–1)(μ-2κ2O,O:3κ1C–1)](PF6) (11). Preliminary
studies on the possible preparation of supramolecular metallopolymers
and electrochemical studies on the series of complexes are also reported.

Introduction
Being strong σ-donor
and relatively weak π-acceptor
ligands, N-heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) have been shown to lead to
robust organometallic complexes with nearly all transition metals.1,2 First applications of metal–NHC complexes were found in homogeneous
catalysis with the generation of highly efficient and now popular
catalytic systems.3 More recently, NHC-complexes
have been applied with great success as highly efficient metallopharmaceuticals,4 luminescent materials,5 and other functional materials.6 The
superiority of NHC ligand stems from the thermodynamically strong
metal–carbene bond and from the low-kinetic lability of the
NHC ligand, avoiding the use of an excess of ligand versus metal center
supplemented by the shielding control over the coordination sphere
exerted by the wingtip N-substituents.7 Yet, the most beneficial feature is likely the high modularity of
the NHC ligands, whose electronic and steric properties can be easily
and independently tuned to match a specific property.8 The synthetic accesses to the NHC precursors are indeed
well established using the countless possibilities of heterocyclic
chemistry.9

Over the last decade,
poly-NHC ligands featuring structurally designed-opposed
carbene moieties have been the subject of intense research efforts
and have found numerous applications as key-bridging ligands for the
construction of discrete polymetallic and metallosupramolecular assemblies,
and main-chain organometallic polymers.10 Alternatively, the design of hybrid and ambidentate NHC ligands,
comprising a carbenic moiety and a functional, coordinating group
arranged in an opposite fashion into the same scaffold, appeared as
a viable and powerful strategy to create new functional discrete and/or
polymeric architectures with original properties. Such a bifunctional
system would indeed combine the anchoring ligation of the carbenic
center with the specific properties brought by the functionalized
backbone and would open—inter alia—the opportunity to
an electronic communication between both binding sites and even between
the two metallic centers. Figure 1 gives an overview of previously reported heteropolymetallic
transition-metal complexes supported by hybrid and ambidentate NHC
ligands, highlighting the diversity of suitable coordinating backbones.

by ambidentate and hybrid NHC ligands and preliminary results on the
IMes-acetylacetonate (acac) ligand reported in our previous communication.23 IPr = 1,3-bis(2,6-diisopropylphenyl)-2H-imidazole-2-ylidene.

The association of NHC and phosphorous-based moieties in
the same
ligand scaffold11 led to the generation
of several heterobimetallic complexes of type A,12B,13C,14 and even to the three-dimensional
trimetallic system D.15 Metallocene
units were also inserted as an integral part of the NHC-skeleton,
giving access to bimetallic systems E–H,16−19 which were shown to have a dramatic effect on the electronic properties
of the NHC ligand, thus giving the opportunity to generate redox-active
ligand systems. In an analogous approach, the metalation of a porphyrin-fused
imidazol-2-ylidene ligand in system I had a strong
influence on the electronic properties of the NHC.20 Eventually, our group developed ambidentate and hybrid
NHC ligands incorporating an anionic imidato J or a carboxylato K ligand moiety as a second coordinating unit.21,22

In 2015, we introduced the new anionic, hybrid 5-acetylimidazol-2-ylidene-4-olate 1–, named as “IMes-acac”,
constituted of fused diaminocarbene and acetylacetonato units in the
same imidazolyl ring (Figure 1).23 At that time, we reported
the straightforward synthesis of its mesoionic precursor 1·H, through acetylation of the corresponding 4-hydroxyimidazolium
chloride, its generation as a free, stable NHC, and demonstrated its
ambidentate character through preliminary coordination studies using
the [(IPr)Cu]+ metallic fragment, leading to complexes L, M, and N. We report herein a
complete, extended study on the coordination behavior of ligand 1– toward various metallic centers and coordination
geometries (Ru, Rh, Cu, and Au), and on the electronic structure of
the resulting complexes, with an emphasis on the possible electronic
interaction between both coordinating units within the ligand framework.

Results
and Discussion
Rh(I) and Ru(II) Heterobimetallic Complexes
of IMes-acac 1–
The [RuCl2(p-Cym)]2 and [RhCl(1,5-COD)]2 dimeric
precursors were chosen for coordination studies with 1– because of their ability to form stable complexes
with anionic bidentate LX-type and NHC ligands, respectively.24 In a first approach, no reaction was detected
when mesoionic 1·H was mixed with 0.5 equivalent
of [RuCl2(p-Cym)]2. This behavior
is similar to the one previously observed when reacting 1·H with (IPr)CuCl and confirms the low coordinating and chelating
propensity of the acac moiety in mesoionic 1·H,
which is unable to displace a chlorido ligand from the coordination
sphere. Actually, subsequent addition of a stoichiometric amount of
silver tetrafluoroborate induced the abstraction of one chlorido ligand
from the Ru(II) center, allowing the formation of the cationic complex
[RuCl(p-Cym)(κ2O,O–1·H)](BF4) (2) in an excellent 97% isolated yield (Scheme 1). Complex 2 was
fully characterized by spectroscopic and analytical techniques. Analogously
to the previously described complex [Cu(IPr)(κ2O,O–1·H)](BF4), the complexation of the acac moiety of 1·H
in 2 was inferred from the 1H NMR data, which
reveal a downfield shift of the imidazolium N2CH proton from δ 7.23 ppm in mesoionic 1·H to δ 7.82 ppm in ionic 2, and an upfield
shift of the acetyl protons from δ 2.41 ppm in 1·H to δ 1.79 ppm in 2, arising from the placement
of the acac-methyl group in the anisotropic cone of the adjacent mesityl
substituent upon complexation. The molecular structure of 2 was then confirmed following a single-crystal X-ray diffraction
study (Figure 2).25 Complex 2 displays a distorted
pseudo-octahedral geometry around the Ru(II) center, in which the p-cymene ligand occupies three adjacent coordination sites,
and the acac backbone of 1– coordinates the Ru(II) center in a chelating mode. Metrical parameters
around the Ru(II) center in 2 are quite analogous to
the standard [RuCl(acac)(p-Cym)],26 or to other relevant [RuCl(acylpyrazolonato)(p-Cym)] complexes.27 Complex 2 is chiral-at-metal and crystallizes as a racemate in the centrosymmetric P21/n space group.

Scheme 1 Synthesis of Rh(I) and Ru(II) Complexes 2–5
Although deprotonation of 2 with potassium hexamethyldisilazide
(KHMDS) at low temperature and warming up the solution to room temperature
led to an intractable mixture of compounds, the direct trapping of
the free NHC generated from 2 at low temperature by half
an equivalent of [RhCl(1,5-COD)]2 dimer gave the stable
heterobimetallic complex [RuCl(p-Cym)][RhCl(COD)](μ-1κ2-O,O:2κ1C–1) (3) in 60%
yield after purification. On contrary to complex 2, which
has to be handled under strict inert conditions, complex 3 is an air- and water-stable compound and could be easily isolated
by column chromatography. Its formulation was confirmed by 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy. The three components of the
complex, that is [RuCl(p-Cym)]+, ligand 1–, and RhCl(COD), appear in the 1H NMR spectrum as distinct sets of signals for each of them and the
respective integrations of the respective signals are 1/1/1. In addition,
the appearance in the 13C NMR spectrum of a doublet at
δ 194.1 ppm (JRh–C = 52 Hz)
is the signature of the formation of a RhCl(NHC)(COD) complex.

At that point, we were wondering whether complex 3 could
be synthesized through the reverse sequence of complexation
that is first, complexation of the NHC part and then complexation
of the anionic acac “upper” part. Contrarily to our
previous observation with other anionic backbone-functionalized NHCs,28 the reaction between the generated free NHC 1·K with 0.5 equivalent of [RhCl(1,5-COD)]2 dimer did not lead to the expected anionic [RhCl(COD)(κ1C–1)]− complex, but to the hitherto uncommon bimetallic complex [(COD)Rh][RhCl(COD)](μ-1κ2O,O:2κ1C–1) (4), in which 1– behaves as a bridging ambidentate ligand.
Complex 4 was subsequently obtained in 74% yield by altering
the stoichiometry of [RhCl(1,5-COD)]2 to one equivalent.
Complex 4 is an air- and water-stable compound and was
purified by column chromatography. The formation of the Rh–CNHC bond was evidenced by a doublet at δ 192.5 ppm (JRh–C = 52 Hz) appearing in the 13C NMR spectrum of 4, and the formation of the di-rhodium
complex was assessed by the observation of two different coordinated
COD ligands in both 1H and 13C NMR spectra.
This is the first time we observed such a direct double complexation
on 1– from a single metallic precursor.
This reactivity pattern can be easily explained in terms of the electronic
nature of the metallic fragment coordinated to the carbenic center.
Indeed, we had previously observed that 1– is able to displace the chlorido ligand in (IPr)CuCl to generate
the zwitterionic complex [Cu(κ1C–1)(IPr)] (L) (see Figure 1), in which the carbenic part
is coordinated to the cationic [Cu(IPr)]+ fragment. Here,
ligand 1– is thought to break the [RhCl(COD)]2 dimer to generate the anionic complex [RhCl(κ1C–1)(COD)]−, in which the carbenic part is coordinated to the neutral [RhCl(COD)]
fragment. Because of this overall charge difference, the pending acac moiety in [RhCl(κ1C–1)(COD)]− has now a restored
nucleophilicity and can displace the chlorido ligand from the second
[RhCl(COD)] fragment released during the dimer-breaking process. Attempts
to efficiently demetalate the acac moiety in 4 were unsuccessful. Indeed, although, according to 1H NMR of the crude mixture, treatment of 4 with an excess
of HCl led to the complete formation of [RhCl(COD)]2 and
the protonated complex [RhCl(κ1C–1OH)(COD)], we were
unable to isolate the latter complex neither by column chromatography
(complex 4 was reformed under these conditions) nor by
selective precipitation of [RhCl(COD)]2 by carrying out
the reaction in methanol (see the Supporting Information for details). Yet, to our delight, the [Rh(COD)]+ fragment
could be cleanly exchanged for the [RuCl(p-Cym)]+ fragment by mixing complex 4 with 0.5 equivalent
of [RuCl2(p-Cym)]2 to afford
heterobimetallic complex 3 in 92% yield, along with the
[RhCl(COD)]2 dimer as the byproduct isolated in 95% yield.
The latter reactivity is the testimony of the lability of the acac moiety versus the carbenic part in ligand 1–.

Complex 3 was converted into
its dicarbonyl derivative
[(p-Cym)ClRu][RhCl(CO)2](μ-1κ2O,O:2κ1C–1) (5) by bubbling
CO gas into a solution of the complex in CH2Cl2 at room temperature. The carbonylation reaction is selective of
the rhodium part, leaving the ruthenium fragment unaffected. Measuring
the average IR-stretching frequency of the carbonyl ligands in 5 allowed assessing of the electron-donor ability of the metallated
NHC ligand “1RuCl(p-Cym)”. The average frequency value νavCO = 2039 cm–1 gives, after linear regression, a Tolman electronic
parameter (TEP) of 2051.5 cm–1, which corresponds
to an electronic donation for 1RuCl(p-Cym) quite similar to the one of the
standard IMes ligand (TEP = 2050.8 cm–1).7b

Group 11 and Ru(II) Heterometallic Complexes
of IMes-acac 1–
Previously,
we reported that
the anionic carbene 1·K easily displaces the chlorido
ligand from (IPr)CuCl to afford the zwitterionic, heteroleptic complex
[Cu(κ1C–1)(IPr)]
(6 or L) in 92% yield (Scheme 2).23 The same reactivity pattern was observed against (IPr)AuCl leading
to complex [Au(κ1C–1)(IPr)] (7) isolated in 72% yield. Complex 7 was fully characterized by spectroscopic and analytical
means. In the 13C NMR spectrum, the chemical shifts of
the carbenic centers of IPr and 1– ligands
at δ = 182.5 and 176.9 ppm, respectively, are similar to the
ones previously reported for related, cationic gold–bis(NHC)
complexes.29 The cationic, heterodinuclear
complex {[(p-Cym)RuCl][Cu(IPr)]](μ-1κ2O,O:2κ1C–1)}(PF6) (9) was obtained in 63% yield by treating the zwitterionic
complex 6 with the cationic Ru(II) precursor [RuCl(CH3CN)2(p-Cym)](PF6) (8). The carbenic carbon atoms of the IPr and 1– NHC ligands in 8 are now observed
at δ 179.0 ppm and δ 177.3 ppm, respectively. Again, the
complexation of the ruthenium fragment onto the acac backbone was accompanied by the shielding of the acetyl protons
from δ = 2.22 ppm in 6 to δ = 1.29 ppm in 9, and the loss of symmetry from Cv in 6 (one mirror plane) to C1 in 9 because of the presence
of the chiral ruthenium center. Consequences in the NMR spectra are
mainly concentrated on the signals of the mesityl groups, which are
all split.

Scheme 2 Synthesis of Zwitterionic Complexes 6–7 and of
Heterobimetallic Complex 9
Altering the reaction stoichiometry between 1·K
and CuCl to a 2:1 ratio led to the novel, anionic, and homoleptic
complex [Cu(κ1C–1)2]K ([10]·K) (Scheme 3). The reaction appeared to be complete in
2 h at 40 °C as judged by NMR of the crude product. The desired
complex was isolated in 67% yield as a beige powder after evaporation
of all volatiles and simple washings with Et2O and water
to remove organic and KCl byproducts, respectively. Because of the
insolubility of [10]K in common organic solvents, a salt
metathesis was carried out by adding an excess of NEt4Cl·xH2O in the biphasic mixture CH2Cl2/H2O to afford the complex [10](NEt4), isolated in 68% yield. [10](NEt4) was found readily soluble in CH2Cl2, CHCl3, acetone, and tetrahydrofuran (THF) but insoluble in Et2O and hydrocarbons. The formulation of 10– as the bis-NHC copper(I) complex [Cu(κ1C–1)2]− was inferred from the 13C NMR spectrum, the resonance
of the two carbene carbon nuclei being observed at δ = 174.0
ppm, a value comparable to the 13C carbenic resonance at
δ = 178.8 ppm in [Cu(IMes)2]+,30 and by mass spectrometry in the negative electrospray
ionization mode, exhibiting a single peak at m/z = 785 a.u. corresponding to the anion [Cu(κ1C–1)2]−. Eventually, because of the symmetry of the molecule,
only one set of signals was observed in the NMR profiles for the two
ligands 1–. Addition of two equivalents
of complex [RuCl(CH3CN)2(p-Cym)](PF6) (8) allowed for the capping of the complex 10– by coordination of the acac moieties to two ruthenium centers. The resulting heterotrimetallic
complex {[RuCl(p-Cym)]2[Cu](μ-1κ2O,O:3κ1C–1)(μ-2κ2O,O:3κ1C–1)}(PF6) (11) was isolated in 58% yield as an air-and moisture-stable red powder.
In the 1H and 13C NMR spectra of complex 11, all but a few resonances are split into two signals of
equal intensity evidencing the presence of two diastereoisomers for
complex 11, namely the racemic mixture (SRu,SRu)-11/(RRu,RRu)-11, and the meso compound (SRu,RRu)-11, in a 1/1
ratio.

Scheme 3 Synthesis of Anionic, Heteroleptic Complexes [10]− and of the Heterotrimetallic Complex 11
Because 10– has shown its ability
to act as a ditopic ligand with ruthenium to generate heterotrimetallic
complex 11, we next investigated the potential of 10– to generate supramolecular metallopolymers
by simply mixing the ligand with a suitable metal ion in solution.
Such self-assembly processes may be easily monitored by UV–vis
titration. However, employing Ni(BF4)2 or Cu(BF4)2 as metal sources, titration experiments led
to the in situ formation of discrete trimetallic species {[M]2[Cu](μ-1κ2O,O:3κ1C–1)(μ-2κ2O,O:3κ1C–1)} (M
= Cu or Ni fragments) instead of metallopolymeric entities (see Figures S13 and S14).31 These data also confirmed the low ability of the acac moiety in 10– to generate homoleptic
species, probably due to electrostatic repulsion.

Electrochemical
Studies
The correlation between the
substitution pattern of ligand 1– and
the redox properties of the different redox-active parts of its complexes 2–7 and 9–11 was evaluated by cyclic
voltammetry (CV) and square-wave voltammetry (SQW). The CV analysis
of precursor 1·H in CH2Cl2 shows an irreversible oxidation wave at Ep,a = + 1.39 V versus saturated calomel electrode (SCE) (Figure 3) that could be assigned to
the one-electron oxidation of the anionic acac moiety
to generate the radical cation [1·H]•+, which decomposed rapidly.32 No other
redox process could be detected within the full potential range (Figure
S2 in the Supporting Information). Interestingly,
the oxidation process became reversible at high scan rates, typically
above 50 V s–1 (Figure S3). The uncoordinated acac backbone is also present
in the zwitterionic complexes 6 and 7 and
in complex [10](NEt4). Similarly to precursor 1·H, we observed only one irreversible oxidation wave
at Ep,a = 0.82 V versus SCE in the cyclic
voltammogram of complex 6, which was assigned to one-electron
oxidation of the acac backbone. However, the significantly
lower oxidation potential, from Ep,a =
1.39 V in 1·H to Ep,a = 0.82 V versus SCE in 6, indicated a strong influence
of the substitution of the N2C carbon
atom on the electronic density within the structure of ligand 1–. This was further confirmed by the CV
data of the isostructural, gold(I) complex 7 because
the same irreversible oxidation process occurred at Ep,a = 0.86 V versus SCE. Although the close values of
the oxidation potentials for 6 and 7 spoke
for oxidation localized on the same part of the complexes, namely
the acac ligand, the difference of 40 mV between
them confirmed the electronic connection of the carbene and acac parts within the ligand heterocycle. Eventually, two
irreversible oxidation waves at Ep,a1 =
0.70 V versus SCE and Ep,a2 = 0.87 V versus
SCE were clearly identified in the CV of the homoleptic anionic complex
[10]−, and could be reasonably assigned
to the successive oxidation of the two distal, acac backbones of ligands 1– in [10]−. In particular, the lower oxidation
potential of the first wave at Ep,a1 =
0.70 V versus SCE compared to the one of 6 (Ep,a = 0.82 V vs. SCE) indicates that the acac moiety and thus the Cu(I) center were more electron-rich in [10]− than in 7. This constituted
an indirect proof that ligand 1– is
more electron-donating than the standard IPr. As the redox processes
were irreversible, no other conclusion could be drawn concerning the
second oxidation wave at Ep,a2 = 0.87
V versus SCE.

(in blue) and complexes 6 (in green), 7 (in

CH2Cl2 with 0.1 M Bu4NPF6 as the supporting electrolyte, 200 mV s–1 scan
rate, spectra calibrated against Fc/Fc+ using as the internal
standard with E1/2 = 0.46 V vs. SCE).

The cyclic voltammogram of complex 2 shows a reversible
1e– oxidation wave at E1/2 = 1.60 V versus SCE that can be assigned to the redox couple RuII/RuIII (Table 1). Three oxidation processes were detected for bis-rhodium
complex 4. The first irreversible oxidation wave at Ep,a = 0.87 V versus SCE corresponds to the couple
RhI/RhII where the rhodium center is coordinated
to the carbene center of 1– as its
potential compares well with the redox potential of metal-centered
oxidation of analogous monometallic RhCl(NHC)(COD) complexes.33 This process became reversible when the CV measurements
were stopped at 1 V versus SCE as the upper limit and with a sweep
rate higher than 10 V s–1. Interestingly, the redox
process RhI/RhII was found to be fully reversible
in the hetero bimetallic complex 3, (E1/2 = 0.86 V vs SCE), which is very close to the one previously
reported for complex RhCl(IMes)(COD) at E1/2 = 0.83 V under the same conditions.33c This definitely confirms that the metallo-NHC ligand 1RuCl(p-Cym) exerts
a similar overall electronic donation to the metal as IMes. The second
irreversible wave at Ep,a = 1.49 V versus
SCE in the CV of 3 most probably corresponds to the RuII/RuIII redox couple, and the shift of the potential
to lower values compared to 2, from 1.60 V in 2 to 1.49 V in 3, indicates here again that the nature
of the group on the N2C carbon atom has
an impact on the redox properties of the acac part.
The same trend was observed in the cyclic voltammograms of Cu/Ru bimetallic
complex 9 and Ru/Cu/Ru trimetallic complex 11, in which the RuII oxidation processes were found irreversible
at Ep,a = 1.41 and 1.44 V versus SCE,
respectively. Moreover, the absence of splitting and of broadening
of the oxidation band for 11 ruled out any possible electronic
communication between the two Ru centers in 11. This
result was quite expected taking into account the long distance between
the two distal ruthenium centers.

Summary
We have conducted a complete exploration of
the coordination chemistry of the hybrid ambidentate IMes-acac ligand 1–, obtained by fusing a diaminocarbene
and an acac unit into the same carbenic heterocycle.
The ability of ligand 1– to act as
an effective ditopic bridging ligand for transition metal centers
has been shown with the synthesis and the full characterization of
a series of homo- and heteropolymetallic complexes incorporating Ru(II),
Rh(I), Cu(I), and Au(I) centers. Noteworthy, while the carbene center
strongly binds the metal ions in all cases, the coordinating strength
of the pending acac moiety depends on the nature
and the charge of the group ligated onto the carbenic part, and ranges
from quite low in the mesoionic precursor 1·H to
strong when the carbene center coordinates a neutral Rh(I) fragment.
In the preliminary studies aiming at the formation of supramolecular
metallopolymers, discrete trimetallic complexes were formed instead,
reflecting the poor tendency of two ligands 1– to coordinate the same metal center in a homoleptic mode through
their respective acac functionality. The electrochemical
measurements on the complexes indicate an electronic interaction between
the two parts of IMes-acac, but the extent of the electronic communication
between the two distal metallic centers through ligand 1– remains quite low. We are therefore considering
further developments aiming at improving both the coordinating strength
of the functional backbone and the electronic communication within
the carbenic scaffold by increasing the denticity of the ligand unit
on the backbone, by changing the nature of the coordinating atoms,
or by modifying the size and structure of the carbenic heterocycle.

Experimental Section
Materials and Methods
All manipulations

Fischer titration. Dimethylformamide was deoxygenated by bubbling
N2 for 15 min and was stored over activated 4Å molecular
sieves.

NMR spectra were recorded on Bruker AV300 or AV400 spectrometers.
Chemical shifts are reported in ppm (δ) compared to tetramethylsilane
(1H and 13C) using the residual peak of deuterated
solvent as the internal standard.35 Infrared
spectra were obtained on a PerkinElmer Spectrum 100 FT-IR spectrometer.
Microanalyses were performed by the Micro Analytical Services of the

Complex [((p-Cym)ClRu)(RhCl(COD))(μ-1κ2O,O:2κ1C–1)] (3)
Starting
from Complex 4
Complex 4 (72.2
mg, 88.1 μmol) and [RuCl2(p-cymene)]2 (29.7 mg, 48.5 μmol, 0.55 equiv)
were dissolved in CH2Cl2 (4 mL) and the solution
was stirred 2 h at 40 °C. The mixture was loaded directly onto
a silica gel column. The first bright yellow fraction eluting with
pure CH2Cl2 obtained after evaporation and drying
[RhCl(COD)2]2 (20.0 mg, 95%), and the second
orange fraction was then eluted using CH2Cl2/MeOH: 95/5 as the solvent mixture, which is obtained after evaporation
and drying the title product as an orange powder (71.5 mg, 92%).

Starting from Complex 2
A solution of
KHMDS (0.5 M in toluene, 380 μL, 0.189 mmol, 1.05 equiv) was
added dropwise to a solution of complex 2 (130 mg, 0.180
mmol, 1.0 equiv) in THF (10 mL) at −80 °C, resulting in
slight darkening of the orange solution. After 20 min, [RhCl(COD)]2 (44.5 mg, 0.09 mmol, 0.50 equiv) was added as a solid to
the reaction mixture and the solution was stirred in the cooling bath
for 6 h. After removing the latter, all volatiles were removed in
vacuo and the dark red residue was purified by flash chromatography
(SiO2, CH2Cl2/MeOH: 99/1) to give
an orange powder (95 mg, 60%).

Electrochemical Studies
The electrochemical
properties
of these compounds were determined by CV and SQW.

CV and SQW
experiments were carried out with an Autolab PGSTAT100 potentiostat
(Metrohm). Electrochemical measurements were performed with a three-electrode
system consisting of a platinum working electrode (0.5 mm diameter
microdisk), a platinum counter electrode, and a SCE as the reference
electrode (separated from the solution by a bridge compartment). Experiments
were carried out under argon in degassed, distilled CH2Cl2, using 0.1 M nBu4NPF6 as the supporting electrolyte and using a typical
concentration of compound of 10–3 M. Spectra were
referenced versus the SCE, and were calibrated against Fc+/Fc redox couple by adding ferrocene at the end of the experiments
[E1/2(Fc+/Fc) = + 0.46 V vs
SCE].

Square-wave voltammograms were obtained using an amplitude
of 20
mV, a frequency of 20 Hz, and a step potential of 5 mV.

X-ray Diffraction
Study of Complex [RuCl(p-Cym)(κ2O,O–1)](BF4) (2)
Single
crystals of 2 were grown by slow diffusion of Et2O into a solution of 2 in CH2Cl2 at room temperature. Data were collected at 100 K on a Bruker
D8/APEX II/Incoatec IμS Microsource diffractometer. All calculations
were performed on a PC compatible computer using the WinGX system.41 The structures were solved using the SIR92 program,42 which revealed in each instance the position
of most of the nonhydrogen atoms. The complex was found to crystallize
with half a molecule of dichloromethane per unit cell. Atomic scattering
factors were taken from the international tables for X-ray crystallography.
All non-hydrogen atoms were resolved by the full matrix least-squares
method using the SHELXL program,43 and
were refined anisotropically. Anomalous dispersion terms for Ru and
Cl were included in Fc. From an initial, idealized positioning (C–H
in the range 0.93–0.98 Å, and Uiso(H) in the range 1.2–1.5 times Uequiv of the attached carbon atom), the H atoms were refined as “riding”
atoms. CCDC 1865121 contains the supplementary crystallographic data
for the structure of 2. These data can be obtained free
of charge from the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre via www.ccdc.cam.ac.uk/data_request/cif.
