Heterostructure
devices consisting of graphene and colloidal quantum
dots (QDs) have been remarkably successful as photodetectors and have
opened the door to technological applications based on the combination
of these low-dimensional materials. This work explores the photodetection
properties of a heterostructure consisting of a graphene field effect
transistor covered by a film of silica-encapsulated colloidal QDs.
Defects at the surface of the silica shell trap optically excited
charge carriers, which simultaneously enables photodetection via two
mechanisms: photogating, resulting in a net p-doping of the device,
and Coulombic scattering of charge carriers in the graphene, producing
an overall decrease in the current magnitude.

Introduction
State-of-the-art photodetectors
today can be fabricated from bulk
semiconductor materials and novel nanomaterials,1−3 such as perovskites.4 In addition, combinations of different types
of low-dimensional nanomaterials have resulted in scientifically interesting
and technologically exciting discoveries. One such hybrid system combines
the superior electronic properties of graphene with a photosensitive
material. For example, joining graphene and optically sensitive diamond
nitrogen-vacancy centers resulted in photodetection via resonant energy
transfer.5 This mechanism was possible
due to the close physical proximity between graphene and diamond,
allowing for the nonradiative transfer of energy from the optically
excited diamond to graphene. The resulting electron–hole pairs
in the graphene device produced a measurable, albeit small photocurrent.
Another popular hybrid system combines the unique, tunable optical
properties of 0D colloidal quantum dots (QDs) with graphene into solar
cells6 and highly sensitive photodetectors.7 Although resonant energy transfer is possible,8 the most efficient photodetectors rely on the
transfer of photoexcited charges between the optically active QDs
and the high mobility graphene.7 The high
sensitivity and large photocurrents of such devices stems from a photogating
mechanism, in which one type of photoexcited charge, for example,
the hole, remains trapped in the QD layer while the other charge is
transferred to the graphene and travels freely through the device.9 The trapped charge electrostatically gates the
underlying graphene device, effectively changing its doping. The high
mobility in the graphene allows the transferred charge to travel many
times through the device before recombining, resulting in a sensitivity-enhancing
gain mechanism, with reported values as high as 108 charge
carriers generated per incident photon.10 Varying the spectral sensitivity of the QDs has produced photodetectors
sensitive to a wide range of light.

This work explores the photodetecting
properties of heterostructures,
depicted in Figure 1a, consisting of a graphene field effect transistor (GFET) covered
with a film of semiconducting, encapsulated colloidal QDs (ECQDs),
which consist of alloyed QDs with a rich CdSe core and gradated ZnS
shell, surrounded by silica. The silica encapsulation was performed
through a reverse microemulsion process in the presence of the alloyed
QDs,11 and the finalized ECQDs were transferred
onto chemical vapor deposition GFETs via a Langmuir–Blodgett
process.12 The 35 nm thick insulating silica
shell of the ECQDs prevented photodetection through either charge
transfer or resonant energy transfer between the graphene and semiconducting
QD, which is simply used to increase the effective absorptive cross
section of the silica spheres. Rather, light-sensitive defect states
at the silica/graphene surface allowed for photodetection via two
simultaneous mechanisms that tended to reduce the overall current:
electron trapping at the defects produces photogating, while also
scattering charge carriers in the graphene channel. Through these
two parallel, simultaneous mechanisms, the ECQD film makes the graphene
photoconductive.

a GFET.

Results
and Discussion
Photodetection in the graphene/ECQD heterostructure
is shown in Figure 1, with an optical
image of the device shown in Figure S1.
Illuminating the device causes the Dirac point voltage VDP, defined as the gate voltage at which the conductivity
is minimum, to shift to more positive values, as shown in Figure 1b. The conductivity
minimum corresponds to the point at which the Fermi energy crosses
graphene’s Dirac point, where its density of states approaches
zero. The residual doping concentration n0 in the graphene can thus be calculated from the Dirac point voltage
as n0 = CoxVDP/q, where q is the elemental charge.13 The
gate oxide capacitance per unit area is given by Cox = ε0εr/d, where εr is the relative permittivity of the SiO2 substrate, ε0 is the free space permittivity,
and d is the oxide thickness of 285 nm. The shift
toward more positive VDP, and thus increased n0 as shown in Figure 1c, indicates that the graphene becomes increasingly
p-doped with increasing illumination. The temporal response of the
photodetection, shown in Figure 1d and for multiple cycles in Figure S2, is on the order of 15 s, with an even longer recovery time,
on the order of several minutes. The current in Figure 1d, measured at a gate voltage Vg = 0 V, decreased upon illumination, which is consistent
with the behavior shown in Figure 1a.

The increased p-doping and decreased current
with illumination
power and relatively slow photoresponse times indicate that photogating
is at least partially responsible for the observed photodetection.7,9 In this case, the p-doping implies that electrons are being trapped,
allowing holes to circulate freely through the channel. Photogating
can result in a sensitivity-enhancing gain mechanism if the time that
the photoexcited charge carrier remains trapped before recombining
τrec is larger than the transit time that it takes
the opposite charge carrier to travel across the device τtrans. This can produce fairly large photocurrents Ipc, proportional to the gain G 1  where μ is the charge carrier mobility
and Vd is the applied drain voltage.9 The transit time across L =
40 μm long device from Figure 1 is about τtrans = L2/μVd = 21 ns. This
results in a gain of 109, considering a recombination time
of about 20 s. The drawback of the photogating mechanism is that the
response time is limited by the recombination of the photocarrier.
Although this gain value is quite high in comparison to other CdSe
QD14 and QD/graphene10 heterostructure devices, its photoresponse time is several
orders of magnitude slower.

Figure 2a shows
the same transfer curves as Figure 1a, but centered about VDP, showing that the measured photocurrent is due not only to photogating
but also to a distortion in the curve shape. Increasing the illumination
causes the curves to “open up”, reducing the transconductance
(g = dId/dVg) magnitude for both the electron (n > 0) and hole (n < 0) branches, as shown
in Figure 2b. Here, n is the gate-dependent charge carrier density in the GFET n = Cox(Vg – VDP)/q.13 The photocurrent is shown in Figure 2c, and the maximum
responsivities (defined as the magnitude of the photocurrent divided
by the illumination power) of the electron and hole branches is shown
in Figure 2d. For low
illumination powers, the photogating induced p-doping and curve distortion
mechanisms reinforce each other in the electron branch, resulting
in large photocurrents and responsivities. In the hole branch, however,
these two mechanisms tend to cancel each other out, with the photogating
increasing the current and the curve distortion decreasing it.

Figure 2 (a) Current
vs gate voltage, centered at Dirac point. (b) Transconductance
and (c) photocurrent vs charge carrier density. (d) Responsivity of
electron and hole branches.

The transconductance, shown in Figure 2b, is directly proportional to the charge
carrier mobility, via the expression 2  where L and W are the transistor length and width.
The hole (electron) mobility
of the GFET corresponds to the transconductance maximum (minima) in
their respective branches. Thus, increasing the illumination clearly
reduces the carrier mobility in both branches. Interestingly, at low
illumination powers the shape of the transconductance and the photocurrent
are similar. This is another indication that a photogating mechanism
is present because the photocurrent will be directly proportional
to the mobility and therefore to the transconductance, as seen from eqs 1 and 2.

Figure 3a
illustrates
two possible ways that photogating could occur, through photoexcitation
of electron–hole pairs either in (I) the graphene or (II) at
the surface of the ECQD silica shell.15−19 In the former case, the electron may hop from the
graphene to the ECQD silica shell, and in the latter, the hole may
hop from the ECQD silica shell surface into the graphene device. The
thick silica shell (about 35 nm) will prevent charge and energy transfer
processes from occurring between the semiconducting core of the ECQDs
and the graphene,20,21 as confirmed via time-dependent
measurements of the ECQD film photoluminescence (Figure S3). The semiconducting QD cores act here as antennas
that increase the effective absorptive cross section of the silica
spheres of the ECQDs, as observed in the absorption spectra in Figure S4, and thus the final photodetection
of the device. Photoluminescence from the semiconducting core of the
ECQDs may also be exciting electron–hole pairs at the silica
surface or even generating charged species such as hydroxyl radicals.22 This effect is expected to be minor compared
to the external illumination, however, due to the low luminescent
quantum yield of the ECQD film, as confirmed by the significant decrease
in lifetime compared to the original ECQDs in solution,11 a result of the film deposition process.12 Besides, RET between the optically active defects
on the silica shell surface and the graphene is only active for wavelengths
below 380 nm (<3.26 eV),17 whereas here
the excitation wavelength is 488 nm (2.54 eV).

Figure 3 (a) Schematic of the
photogating mechanism, with photoexcitation
in (I) the graphene or (II) the ECQD silica shell surface. In both
cases, the resulting trapped electron on the graphene/silica interface
also acts as a charge scatterer. (b) Schematic showing the effect
of illuminating the ECQDs. Electron (blue) and holes (orange) are
created both on the semiconducting core, where they can combine either
radiatively or non-radiatively, and on the silica surface. Horizontal
black bars represent trap states that exist on the surface of the
silica. In the vicinity of the silica/graphene surface, electrons
accumulate leading to photogating and the scattering of charge carriers
in the GFET. (c) Inverse mobility vs illumination power.

Any of the aforementioned scenarios end with immobilized
charges
on the silica shell. Although both electron and hole trapping may
be present, electron trapping is dominant because a net p-doping is
observed in the device. This is illustrated in Figure 3b, which shows the accumulation of electrons
present on the silica surface (depicted in blue) near the graphene/ECQD
interface. Increased illumination power produces more electron–hole
pairs, more trapping, and thus increased photo-doping. The decrease
in responsivity with increasing illumination power, shown in Figure 2d, indicates that
an energy barrier must be overcome in order for charge transfer to
occur between the graphene and silica shells.7 The n-doping produced in the graphene FETs by depositing the ECQD
films, as shown in Figure S5 and reported
previously,12 is the evidence that such
a built-in energy barrier is present in the system. An exponential
increase in the illumination power, and thus in the photoexcited charge
carrier concentration, is required for the carriers to overcome the
built-in energy barrier and produce a linear increase in the photocurrent.

Films of silica nanoparticles, carefully assembled through the
Langmuir–Blodgett technique, have a collective effective refractive
index, and can function as antireflective coatings in the visible
light range.23,24 This collective optical behavior
can emerge when the wavelength of the light is much larger than the
diameter of the individual nanoparticles. The changes in the refractive
index, and thus the reflectivity, caused by the ECQD film are on the
order of one. This effect is therefore not expected to significantly
contribute to the photodetection, considering the exponential increase
in light illumination required to appreciably increase the photocurrent.
Therefore, photogating might be caused primarily by the accumulation
of electrons at the ECQD/graphene interface.

The reduced mobility
of both the electron and hole branches observed
in Figure 2 indicates
that charge carriers in graphene are being scattered upon illumination,
with long-range Coulomb scattering from charged impurities being the
dominant mechanism at room temperature.25 The scattering could be due to light-induced point defect states,
such as O and Si vacancies, at the surface of the silica shells.15−19 Optical transitions can occur between silica point defects, whose
localized states are in the bandgap, or between the defect states
and the valence or conduction band of the silica. This can lead in
some cases to the formation of self-trapped excitons.15,16 Optically excited defect states in the silica bandgap could act
as the trap sites for electrons in the photogating effect described
above. These electrons, trapped on the silica surface at the graphene/silica
interface, effectively act as charged p-doping impurities, scattering
charge carriers in the graphene. The concentration of charged impurities
causing scattering is predicted to be directly proportional to μ–1. The inset of Figure 3b shows that for low illumination power, μ–1 is linearly proportional to the logarithm of the
illumination power, especially for electrons. This indicates that
a logarithmic increase in the illumination causes a linear increase
in charge scattering impurities at the silica surface. At higher illumination
powers, the electron μ–1 saturates, possibly
due to the saturation of electron trapping centers in the silica surface,
which will tend to preferentially scatter electron charge carriers.26 In contrast, the significant increase of μ–1 for holes indicates that some hole scattering impurity,
originating at the ECQD silica shells surface, is still being efficiently
created at high illumination powers.

This photoscattering mechanism
is not observed in graphene photodetectors
with colloidal materials such as PbS QDs. This is because the trapped
electron resides at the semiconducting core of the QD (where the electron–hole
pair is optically generated) and not at its surface.7 The core is separated by several nanometers from the graphene
by organic ligands, too far for the charge scattering effect to be
efficient.27 In the graphene/ECQD photodetectors,
self-trapped excitons at the silica surface, consisting of a bound
state of an electron and a hole, could also act as charge scattering
centers for both types of graphene charge carriers. The gate bias
could also have an effect on the scattering. Positive gate biases
will tend to attract the negatively charged defect states in the silica
closer to graphene, leading to increased electron charge scattering
and lowering the electron mobility.27 Photoscattering,
like photogating, is caused by the accumulation of scattering centers
at the ECQD/graphene interface.

The photodetector presented
herein demonstrates yet another successful
combination of 2D/0D hybrid heterostructures. In this device, photodetection
through charge trapping at optically active defect states at the silica
surface of the ECQDs. The trapped charges affect the conductivity
of the GFET device not only through a photogating mechanism, but also
through a photoscattering mechanism, that should be taken into account
in engineering future photodetection devices based on graphene and
colloidal QDs.

Experimental Section
ECQDs were
synthesized via hot-injection method for the synthesis
of the CQD core, followed by a microemulsion process to encapsulate
the cores in a SiO2 shell. Graphene was grown on copper
foils in a chemical vapor deposition furnace, followed by a wet etch
transfer process onto the substrate. GFET fabrication was carried
out via photolithography, and the ECQD film was transferred onto the
samples via the Langmuir–Blodgett method. Each of these steps
is explained in detail in the Supporting Information.
