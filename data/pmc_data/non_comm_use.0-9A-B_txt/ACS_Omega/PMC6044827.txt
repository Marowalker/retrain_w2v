The fabrication of polymeric nanofibers
and its potential versatility
instigated to foster smart hybrid nanomaterials for the removal of
environmental pollutants. In this pursuit, in this research work,
polyacrylonitrile (PAN)-based two-dimensional (2D) nanofibrous mats
with polyethyleneimine (PEI)/Fe and quaternary ammonium (QA)/Fe as
hybrid fillers were prepared by the electrospinning process for the
effective dye removal and bacterial disinfection. The characteristics
of the fabricated nanomaterials were extensively explored by several
analytical techniques such as field emission-scanning electron microscopy,
transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform
infrared spectroscopy, and Brunauer–Emmett–Teller analysis.
Magnetic and thermal properties were investigated by superconducting
quantum interference device and thermogravimetric measurements. The
kinetic and isothermal models affirmed the adsorption behavior of
the PAN–PEI/Fe nanofibers, and further regenerative studies
substantiated the sustainability of the mats for the removal of industrial
dye effluents. Subsequently, the magnetic-QA-loaded PAN nanofiber
mats exhibited bactericidal killing efficacy of 99 and 89.5% in both Staphylococcus aureus and green fluorescence protein
expressing Escherichia coli bacterial
models evaluated from the conventional quantitative bacterial colony-counting
assay. Disk diffusion method and microscopic investigations corroborated
the disinfection efficacy with zone of inhibitions of ∼23 and
33 mm, respectively. Interestingly, in vitro cell culture studies
conducted in BHK-21 and NIH 3T3 cell lines demonstrated the cytocompatibility,
and the in vivo toxicity investigations using the zebrafish models
necessitated the real-time application of these nanofibrous mats.
Therefore, the comprehensive study of the fabricated PAN-templated
functionalized 2D nanofibrous mats affirmed to be competent for the
remediation of industrial dye effluents and bacteria in water bodies.

==== Body
Introduction
Clean
water is the major topic of the current research because
it is an important source of life for humans and environment. Microbial
contamination is the major cause of waterborne diseases such as diarrhea,
which causes up to 1.8 million deaths annually.1 Similarly, due to industrialization, large-scale discharge
of effluents containing toxic dyes and heavy metal ions from manufacturing
industries such as cosmetic, leather, paper, textile, pharmaceuticals,
and so on to nearby water bodies is also highly detrimental to human
health and environment.2 Hence, researchers
are in inevitable need to put forth a sturdy solution to get rid of
these noxious contaminants from the environment.

The customary
treatment processes for obtaining safe water from
the industrial effluents and wastewater treatment plants involve mechanical
aeration and disinfection of microbes by chlorination, among others.
Furthermore, other conventional treatment technologies, such as ozonization,
filtration, electrochemical processes, and other biological methods
using microorganisms are facing extensive drawbacks due to their ineffectiveness,
thus leading to the formation of intermediate byproducts whose treatment
becomes complex and requires posttreatment separation techniques and
machineries.3−5 Again, the light source mediated treatment process
such as ultraviolet irradiation is completely dependent on higher
energy consumption, making the treatment expensive.6 To address these problems, the development of robust and
smart functionalized nanomaterials in a uniform two-dimensional (2D)
platform with practical feasibility which could act as an effective
adsorbent for removal of toxic dyes, having innate bactericidal properties
for disinfection and biocompatibility towards human and other living
organisms present in the water bodies to maintain the sustained ecosystem
is necessitated.

Ample number of studies have been reported on metals and metal oxide as cost-effective nanoadsorbents for the
adsorption of dyes,7−11 polymer-based hybrid adsorbents, and polymeric nanocomposites for
the removal of heavy metals and dyes.12,13 In polymer-templated
metal oxide nanostructures, unforeseen conditions
that lead to the release of metal oxide nanoparticles (NPs) to the
environment may arise due to the hydrophilic polymer templates. Taking
into account the aforementioned drawback and the eventual real-time
applicability, several electrospun metal oxide doped nanofibrous adsorbents
for decolorization of dyes were developed;14−19 recently, a dual functional hybrid polyacrylonitrile (PAN) nanofiber
(Nf)-templated nanofibrous membrane having high tensile properties
was reported.20 Following the above work,
the current research explores the dye removal and bacterial disinfection
applications using the aforementioned PAN-templated nanofibers functionalized
with composite nanomaterials.

In recent times, polyethyleneimine
(PEI) has fascinated the researchers
due to the high density of amine group, which has a greater affinity
toward the adsorption of heavy metals and other cationic dye pollutants,
present at the end of the chain. Several studies have been reported
on the polymer-coated iron oxide nanoparticles (NPs) showing promising
results in removing the environmental contaminants.21−23 Moreover, hydrophilic
PEI stabilized by the silica nanocomposites for the adsorption of
both cationic and anionic dyes has been reported.24 Therefore, the preliminary work elucidated the hydrothermal
synthesis of PEI–Fe functionalized PAN-templated nanofibers
and explicated the adsorption properties toward cationic congo red
(CR) dye. Furthermore, the sustainability studies corroborated the
robust nature of the proposed nanofibrous adsorbent suitable for the
real-time applications. Quaternary ammonium (QA) complexes are surface
active agents that were first synthesized and identified to have antibacterial
property several years ago.25 These are
cationic detergents that form micelles by reducing the surface tension
and are hydrophilic in nature, which allows their easy dispersion
in liquid. QAs occur in different structures, with the central region
consisting of a cationic nitrogen attached to four groups of different
structures and an anionic bromine linked to the nitrogen to form the
QA salt.26 Currently, these compounds are
widely used as commercial products in healthcare and food industries
for sanitizing, disinfecting, and cleaning agents.27 The QAs are classified based on the nature of the alkyl
group with number of nitrogen atoms, the number of carbon chains attached,
and the occurrence of aromatic groups. These moieties determine the
antibacterial activity of the QAs against different microorganisms.
The length of the alkyl group of these compounds also affects their
antimicrobial activity,28 as the methyl
groups having carbon chains of length 12–16 usually show the
highest antibacterial activity compared with compounds with shorter
chains.29 Furthermore, the mechanism of
action of the quaternary ammonium compounds toward bacteria was reported
in earlier studies,30,31 and the dose-dependent toxic
effect of QAs toward several microorganisms such as bacteria, viruses,
spores, and so on was also reported. The broad spectrum of the antibacterial
action of different formulations of QAs towards different bacterial
systems25 and also antibiotic resistant
strains is already studied.32 The latter
section of this research work focuses on the utilization of these
robust antibacterials as disinfecting agents into the PAN nanofibers.
In brief, QAs were formulated in solution form by loading stipulated
concentrations of QA into the PAN polymer solution, which will act
as the template for the nanofibers and these compounds are further
coated over the iron oxide nanoparticles before loading in the solution
to make the separation process easier after disinfection. Because
the iron oxide nanoparticles had hardly any antibacterial property,
the QAs, which were loaded into the nanofibers, are the only proprietary
for the disinfection activity. This explains that the main significance
of the iron oxide nanoparticles used in the fabrication was to accomplish
the magnetic levitation of the nanofibrous mats using strong magnets
after disinfection procedures. Further, the cell viability of both
PAN–PEI/Fe and magnetic-QA-loaded PAN nanofibrous mats was
investigated to understand their biocompatibility toward animal cells
to rationalize their commercial applicability. Also, in vivo animal
toxicity studies of the nanofibrous mats were also performed using
zebrafish as the model organisms to ascertain their fate of toxicity.

Herein, the nanofiber-based nanomaterials were fabricated in 2D
form by using the same platform of PAN nanofibers for the industrial
dye removal and bacterial disinfection simultaneously, which makes
the work unique from all of the other earlier studies. The desired
advantages of the proposed functionalized 2D nanofibrous materials
met all of the criteria such as reusability, biocompatibility, low
in vivo toxicity, effective bactericidal property, and high stability
in water that are greatly required for any commercial water purification
systems.

Results and Discussion
Preparation and Characterization
Procedural steps in
the fabrication of nanofibers are illustrated in the Supporting Information (Figure S1A,B). Iron acetylacetonate is the precursor salt used in the formation
of iron oxide immobilized PAN–PEI nanofibers (Figure S1A), whereas the PAN nanofibers in the latter are
magnetized by loading presynthesized magnetic-QA complex into the
nanofibers to accomplish easier separation after disinfection.

Morphological
Investigations
The electrospun two-dimensional
nanofibrous structures actually open up the real perspectives for
commercialization. Nanofibrous network with intrinsic properties of
the filler materials plays a significant role in the application-driven
strategies. Moreover, there was no change in the structure or the
adsorption and disinfection properties of both as-prepared and heat-treated
nanofibers. Due to the aforementioned properties and the robust nature of nanostructures, 2D nanofibers mats were
employed in the present work. The field emission-scanning electron
microscopy (FE-SEM) morphology of the hydrothermally carbonized PAN–PEI/Fe
nanofibers is shown in Figure 1a–c, with an average diameter of 771 ± 101 nm
(in Figure 1b). The
elemental analysis constituting carbon (∼65%), oxygen (∼31%),
and iron (∼3%) is represented in the Supporting Information (Figure S2a,b). Meanwhile,
the FE-SEM image of the interim material of QA-coated Fe3O4 NPs is shown in Figure S3a, and the energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis confirmed the presence
of elemental carbon (∼5%), oxygen (∼37%), nitrogen (∼0.87%),
and iron (∼56%) (Figure S3b,c).
The final QA-loaded PAN and magnetic-QA-loaded PAN nanofibers (Nfs)
are illustrated in Figure 2a,b, and the difference in their size distribution is clearly
depicted in Figure 2c,d. The elemental mapping of magnetic-QA-loaded PAN nanofibers represented
in Figure 3a,b substantiated
the occurrence of iron implied by the marked nodes over the surface
of nanofibers (represented in dotted circles). Figure 3c demonstrates the frequency map of magnetic-QA-loaded
PAN nanofibers operated by the EDX line scan represented in different
colors. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis determines
the interface between the coated QA complex and Fe3O4 NPs shown in Figure 3d, and the selected area electron diffraction pattern (inset
of Figure 3e) pinpointed
the crystalline nature of iron oxide nanoparticles having cubic structure.
Further, TEM differentiated the QA-coated outer shell of uniform thickness
of 16 ± 0.5 nm surrounding the core Fe3O4 nanoparticle represented in Figure 3f, and the elemental analysis affirmed the presence
of carbon, oxygen, and iron implied by the predominant peaks (inset
of Figure 3f).

X-ray Diffraction (XRD)
The structural property and
crystalline nature of the nanomaterials were characterized by powder
X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements and analyzed using PANalytical
X’Pert High Score Plus. Figure 4a represents the XRD pattern of PAN/PEI–Fe nanofibers,
with the characteristic diffraction peaks indexed to 2θ
at 15, 18.39, 30.27, 35.59, 57.16, and 62.72° corresponding to
(110), (111), (220), (311), (511), and (440) planes, respectively,
in accordance with the JCPDS file (PDF-004-0755) with face-centered
cubic lattice ascribed to the maghemite phase (γ-Fe2O3). Similarly, the characteristic peaks of bare Fe3O4 NPs, magnetic-QA complex, and magnetic-QA-loaded
PAN nanofibers found at 2θ are 18.27, 30.06, 35.45, 37.12, 53.54,
57.16, 62.72, 70.78, and 73.99°, respectively, with JCPDS file
(PDF-001-1111) shown in Figure 4b. The crystalline size of the nanoparticles determined by
Debye–Scherrer equation (D(1/4)Kl/b cos q, with K(1/4)0.9) is 180 ± 50 nm, which is correlated with
the FE-SEM and TEM investigations. However, the intensity of the diffraction
peaks of magnetic-QA-loaded PAN nanofibers (Figure 4b) decreases with varying concentrations
of Fe3O4 NPs and the polymeric nanofibrous network
reported in earlier works.33,34

Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) analyses
of PAN–PEI/Fe and magnetic-QA-loaded PAN nanofibrous mats.

FTIR
The FTIR
profiles of PAN−PEI/Fe nanofibers
in Figure 4c show the
characteristic peaks at 2357 and 1573 cm–1 associated
with the stretching vibrations of the nitrile groups (CN−),
which got reduced after hydrothermal treatment, stretching and bending
vibrations of the methylene (−CH2−) groups,
respectively. Additional peaks at 3448 and 1643 cm–1 are attributed to the stretching vibrations of (N–H) and
carbonyl groups, and the peak at 1378 cm–1 indicates
the C=O symmetric stretching bond frequency of the carboxylate
salt (COO−). Furthermore, the low-intensity absorption peak
at 657 cm–1 that appeared after the hydrothermal
treatment of the PAN–PEI/Fe nanofibers was attributed to the
(Fe–O) stretching vibration of the iron precursor; upon heat
treatment, the peak got diminished due to the higher iron loading
onto PAN–PEI/Fe nanofibers. Subsequently, the FTIR spectra
of bare Fe3O4 NPs, magnetic-QA complex and magnetic-QA-loaded
PAN nanofibers are shown in Figure 4d. Wavenumbers from 2930 to 2855 cm–1 indicate the asymmetric and symmetric stretching vibrations of methylene
(CH2−) groups present in the PEI. The broad and
intense band at 1636 cm–1 assigned to the carbonyl
(C=O) group is attributed to the cyclic nature of the quaternary
ammonia compounds, and the wide range of absorption band peaks between
1140 and 1040 cm–1 is due to the stretching vibrations
of the nitrile (−CN) group.35 The
characteristic peaks of the remaining spectra were diminished due
to the polymer matrix of the electrospun nanofibers.

Thermogravimetric
Analysis
The thermogravimetric analysis
of PAN–PEI/Fe nanofibers was performed to study the thermal
degradation behavior, and the representative spectra are shown in Figure S4a. The nanofibers follow the uniform
degradation profile before and after hydrothermal treatment in which
the former undergoes a mild two-step degradation between 250 and 350
°C due to the presence of cross-linked polyethyleneimine (PEI)
and the latter undergoes a single-step degradation. The quantity of
iron oxide nanoparticles grown in situ onto the nanofibers is very
small, where only 7 and 2% of the residuals are left behind after
heating up to 800 °C. Similarly, thermal behavior of the magnetic-QA-loaded
PAN nanofibers was also analyzed as shown in the Supporting Information (Figure S4b). The initial weight loss at 200 °C is due to the physiochemical
absorption of moisture and the QA compounds, followed by 70% residue
left in the case of magnetic-QA complex at the end of 800 °C
due to the iron oxide nanoparticles, and finally the magnetic-QA-loaded
PAN nanofibers undergo complete degradation with increase in the weight
loss, but the thermal stability of the composite nanofibers is greatly
enhanced at higher temperatures due to the transition iron oxide nanoparticles
loaded onto the polymeric nanofibrous network.36,37

Surface Area Measurement
To investigate the surface
area and porosity of the magnetic-QA complex, N2 adsorption–desorption
isotherm was performed (Figure 5a). From the figure, the isotherm can be classified as type
III hysteresis loop, which is the characteristic of the nonporous
structures of the iron oxide nanoparticles between the range 0.1 and
0.9 of relative pressure that possess the multilayer adsorption property
having the surface area 29.09 m2/g using multipoint Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) measurements which is higher than the as-prepared cubic structured
nanoparticles reported.38 The pore radius
and pore volume of the magnetic-QA complex are tabulated in the Supporting Information (Table S2). Further, the separation property of the magnetic-QA-loaded
PAN nanofibers are discussed in the following experiments.

Figure 5 (a) N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms and (b)
superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) analysis.

Magnetic Properties
The magnetization (M) characteristics of the field-
and temperature-dependent properties
of the bare Fe3O4 NPs, magnetic-QA complex,
and magnetic-QA-loaded PAN nanofibers were determined by superconducting
quantum interference device (SQUID) applying the magnetic field (H) ranging from −50 000 to +50 000
Oe at room temperature (26 °C). Figure 5b illustrates the hysteresis loop of the
aforementioned nanomaterials having the saturation magnetizations
(Ms) of bare Fe3O4 NPs (83.37 emu/g) and magnetic-QA complex (78.79 emu/g). However,
the magnetization of magnetic-QA-loaded PAN nanofiber was decreased to
a larger extent (5.65 emu/g) due to the deep-seated encapsulation
of the QA complex over the Fe3O4 NPs within
the acrylic polymer matrix. The presence of steep slopes of magnetization (Figure S4c,d) when the applied external
magnetic field is close to zero is called remnant magnetization (Mr), which exquisitely implies the supraparamagnetic
behavior, with strong magnetic signals having Mr values of 10.5, 9.5, and 0.528 emu/g that can be desirable
for the practical applications. Hence, the magnetic-QA-loaded PAN
nanofibers can be stimulated by the external magnetic field with such
low magnetization values that will be required for the constructive
removal of pollutants such as heavy metal, bacteria, azo dyes, and
so on.

Adsorption Experiments
Adsorption experiments were
performed to investigate the effect of contact time and adsorption
efficiency of the nanofibers using congo red (CR) as a model dye (Figure 6a,b). The residual
dye concentration was determined from the calibration curve between
the different concentrations and their corresponding absorbance as
reported.39 Digital photographs of dye
solutions before and after adsorption is shown in the inset of Figure 6b. The studies on
the effect of adsorption time, desorption, and reusability were carried
out using the PAN–PEI/Fe nanofibers. Simulated dye solutions
of different concentrations ranging from 20 to 60 mg/L, pH ∼6.5,
and 3 h adsorption time were used in the regenerative studies. The
adsorption isotherm was carried out using PAN–PEI/Fe nanofibrous
adsorbent to determine the maximum adsorption capacity, and the results
were compared with three different isotherm models namely the Langmuir
isotherm, Freundlich isotherm, and Dubinin–Radushkevich isotherm
models, respectively. Isothermal plots of Langmuir and Freundlich
models are shown in Figure 6c,d, and the outcome of other model parameter results are
tabulated in the Supporting Information (Table S3). From the model results, it
was ascertained that the correlation coefficient (R2 = 0.9877) of Langmuir plot yielded better fit compared
with the Freundlich and Dubinin–Radushkevich models having
the correlation coefficient values of 0.971 and 0.967, respectively.
Additionally, the characteristic feature of Langmuir isotherm can
be expressed in terms of a dimensionless constant (RL). The value of RL lies between
0 and 1, which is the favorable condition for the monolayer adsorption
process. Meanwhile, the model parameter results of Langmuir isotherm
having the maximum adsorption capacity (qm) value of 77.5 mg/g, KL = 0.190, and RL = 0.34–0.37 were correlated
with those in the literature. These investigations imply that the
adsorption property of the PAN–PEI/Fe nanofiber mats toward
the CR dye is more effective compared to that of the other nanofibrous
adsorbents reported earlier.40

shown in the inset of Figure 7b). Adsorption
studies: (c) Langmuir plot, (d) Freundlich plot, (e) first-order kinetics,
and (f) second-order kinetics.

Adsorption Kinetics
Adsorption mechanism of the adsorbent
was studied by the kinetic models of pseudo first- and -second-order
plots (Figure 6e,f),
and the results are illustrated in Table S4. The outcome of these studies suggested that the PAN–PEI/Fe
nanofibrous adsorbent follows rapid adsorption kinetics and the adsorption
property may be attributed to the electrostatic interaction between
the positively charged amine group of PEI and iron oxide nanoparticles
on PAN nanofibers with the cationic dye used. In comparison to the
other adsorbents, the PAN–PEI/Fe nanofibers possess remarkable
kinetic behavior that is appropriate for industrial applications.

Regenerative Studies
Desorption and Reusability Assay
The adsorptive performance
of the adsorbent was tested in a heuristic approach by the successive
adsorption–desorption cycles for 10 times continuously. In
brief, 25 mg of each adsorbent was taken in tubes containing different
concentrations of the dye (i.e., 20, 40, and 60 mg/L); after adsorption,
the adsorbents were separately treated with alkali for 2 h of desorption
and the regenerated nanofibrous adsorbents were then ready for successive
adsorption studies. Similarly, the reusability tests were done without
performing any postadsorption treatment procedures, and 10 repeated
cycles were carried out for both the assays. Bar graphs shown in Figure 7a,b pin point the obvious change in the untreated and treated
cycles, supporting the desorption and reusable capability leveraged
by the nanofibrous adsorbent.

and (b)
reusability studies.

Disinfection Control Experiments
Colony-Counting Method
Preceding the disinfection studies,
the concentration of QA complex was optimized (Table S1) by using the QA-alone and magnetic-QA-loaded PAN
nanofibers (samples 1 and 2 with QA concentration of 5 mg/L), which
were predominantly utilized for all of the antibacterial assays. The
rationale behind this selection is that loading higher concentration
of QA leads to the formation of self-assembled three-dimensional nanofibrous
sponges (see Figure S1B), which affects
the 2D nanofibrous membrane morphology and stability in water. The
antibacterial efficacy of the magnetic-QA-loaded PAN nanofibers toward Staphylococcus aureus and green fluorescence protein
(GFP) expressing Escherichia coli was
evaluated by the traditional colony-counting method by the enumeration
of bacterial colonies by two different methods, namely, estimated
(using heuristic approximation) and experimental method (experimental
procedures are elucidated in Figure S5).
Bacterial cell population was determined by aliquoting the parent
culture using serial dilution with a minimum of five dilutions having
108–104 colony-forming units per milliliter
(CFUs/mL), and each dilution was treated with nanofibers of dimensions
1 cm × 1 cm (sample 2). Figure 8a,b shows the decreased trend of the bacterial population
after treatment for 8 h. Interestingly, in the experimental method,
significant change in the number of bacterial colonies between the
untreated and treated cultures (dilutions of 108 and 107 CFU/mL) followed by an intense decrease in the colonies of
the treated cultures due to dilutions (106–104 CFU/mL). These results clearly show that the magnetic-QA-loaded
PAN nanofibers exhibited more than 90% killing efficacy with increasing
efficacy toward GFP E. coli because
of their antibiotic resistance (Figure S6). The digital photographs of bacterial plates having colonies of
untreated and treated cultures with different dilutions of both bacterial
models are illustrated in the Supporting Information (Figure S7A,B).

PAN nanofibers; 3, QA-PAN nanofibers (mean diameter of the nanofiber
disk is 13 mm) (estd, estimated; exp, experimental).

Optical Density (OD) Measurements
The bacterial inhibition
property of the various formulations of nanofibers was assessed by
UV–vis spectrophotometer measurements of optical density (OD)
at 600 nm. Histogram in Figure S8 elucidate
the decreased tendency in the treated nanofibers samples compared
with the untreated bacterial sample, which reiterated that the killing
efficacy of the nanofibers is not affected in both S. aureus and GFP E. coli irrespective of the concentration of QA-loaded onto the PAN nanofibers.

Disk Diffusion Assay
The nanofiber samples used for
this assay are alone PAN nanofibers, QA-loaded PAN, and magnetic-QA-loaded
PAN nanofibers against S. aureus and
GFP E. coli shown in Figure 8c. The results show that the
alone PAN does not show any bacterial inhibition; however, effective
inhibition zones of average diameter of ∼17.5 and ∼24.5
mm (S. aureus) and 22.4 and 32.5 mm
(GFP E. coli) were observed in the
nanofiber-treated samples represented in Figure 8d. These investigations implied that the
iron oxide nanoparticles were employed only for the purpose of magnetic
separation, which gives the clear evidence that the QA complexes are
crucial bacterial scavengers. Contemplating the release of QA complex
to the environment, these bacterial scavengers are embedded in the
polymeric nanofiber matrix in which the release is regulated unconditionally
using the optimized concentration of QA-loaded nanofibers (as discussed
earlier) as per the desired membrane morphology and physical nanofiber
mat formation. The release of the QA complex into the water (Figure S9) is identified by the formation of
peak at 362 nm in UV–vis spectrophotometer, whereas no peak
is observed in the QA-loaded PAN nanofibers even after treated for
24 and 48 h, respectively. These properties necessitated the researches
for the selection of synthetic polymers such as PAN to be used as
templates for antibacterial membrane fabrication, and its sustainable
bactericidal property is also assessed by performing repeated cyclic
assays; no colonies were observed in all of the cycles (data not shown).
Further, the nanofibers were separated by external magnet after disinfection
and regenerated by repeated washing and used for further study. These
investigations implied the reliability of the proposed nanofibrous
materials possessing antibacterial properties.

Disinfection
Mechanism
The mode of bactericidal action
of the quaternary ammonium (QA) complex was identified from earlier
reports such as electrostatic interaction between the cationic QA
salts and the anionic bacterial cell membrane, followed by permeation,
leakage of intracellular components, and lysis of the cell.41 Eventually, the fluorescence microscopic investigations
substantiated the bactericidal property of the alone QA-loaded and
magnetic-QA-loaded PAN nanofibers (Figure 9a–f). Furthermore, the nanofiber-treated
bacterial cultures grown on the agar plates found no bacterial colonies,
supporting the fluorescence microscopic studies.

the nanofibers: 1 cm × 1 cm). Scale bar: 20 μm.

Biocompatibility Assay
Appropriate
percentage of cell
viability (85%) was achieved with PAN–PEI/Fe and different
extents of QA-loaded PAN nanofibers (5–20 mg/L) at the end
of 48 h (Figure 10). The sample details of different nanofiber formulations are elucidated
in the Supporting Information (as mentioned
earlier). Nonetheless, decreased viability was observed in sample
4 due to the maximum concentration of QA loaded onto the nanofibers
(20 mg/L), which exhibited mild toxicity toward both the cell lines
baby hamster kidney (BHK-21) and mouse embryonic fibroblast (NIH 3T3).
Representative fluorescence microscopic images in Figure 11 demonstrate the biocompatibility of the
different formulations of nanofiber after 48 h against the animal
cell lines by using Hoechst 33342 (blue) and rhodamine B (Rho B, red)
dyes, both of which stain the respective intracellular components
of the cell such as nuclei and cytosol. No significant decrease in
cell number and fluorescence intensity and changes in morphology were
hardly observed. These investigations profoundly advocated the compatibility
of the nanofibers toward the cell lines, leading to the practical
disinfection applications.

In Vivo Toxicity Studies
Practical applicability of
the nanofibrous material was studied by assessing the fate of these
nanomaterials in the environment, and it is highly necessary to address
the implications and the potential outcome of the studies.42 Zebrafish models acquired several advantages
such as transpicuous and rapid embryogenic development and being genetic
analogous to humans, which make them better animal models and suitable
candidate for investigating the adverse effects posed by the proposed
nanofibrous material. The zebrafish models were treated with nanofibers
samples at different stages for every 24 h up to 144 h postfertilization
(hpf) and observed more than 85% of survival rate in the samples 1,
2, 3, and 5 except in the sample 4, where the maximum concentration
of QA was loaded into nanofibers and the extent of the survival rate
was compared with the untreated zebrafish embryos, which act as the
control sample (Figure 12). The microscopic images of the zebrafish embryos were recorded
every 24 h to substantiate the phenotypic transformations after nanofiber
treatment (Figure 13), and the digital photographs of the zebrafish are shown in the Supporting Information (Figure S10b,c). Interestingly, no malformations were found in the
zebrafish subjected to the nanofiber treatment, exempting sample 4
in which the dead embryos are found with deformations such as bent
spine and pericardial edema after 48 h owing to the maximum loading
of QA and iron oxide nanoparticles (images of dead embryos are shown
in Figure S10d–f). However, the
morphology of the other treated samples are quite identical to those
of the control (row 1 in Figure 13), where the embryos are grown irrespective of the
addition of double number of nanofiber disks after 72 h in water.
Comprehensively, the toxicity and deformations of the zebrafish models
were hardly visible after treatment with the alone QA-loaded and magnetic-QA-loaded
PAN nanofibers, which profoundly suggested that the proposed nanomaterials
are highly biocompatible and excellent disinfectant for the removal
of bacteria and other microorganisms compared with other metal-based
nanoparticles (AgNPs).43

Conclusions
In
this work, PAN-templated 2D nanofibrous mats were developed
by electrospinning method for the simultaneous removal of toxic dyes
and bacterial disinfection. Rather than the theoretical considerations
traditionally followed in earlier works, this work leaps forward by
putting forth a pragmatic approach by designing a robust platform
in the form of two-dimensional nanofibrous mats that can be highly
preferred for commercial applications. Salient features of the PAN–PEI/Fe
nanofibers include an effective adsorption efficiency and regenerative
and reusability properties. However, the magnetic-QA-loaded PAN nanofibers
quantitatively exhibited higher disinfection action toward both S. aureus and GFP E. coli, with more than 90% killing efficacy in both the bacterial systems
(evaluated from the colony-counting method), supraparamagnetic property
for separation, high biocompatibility through in vitro animal cell
culture studies, and the desired less in vivo toxicity toward zebrafish
models. These results corroborated the feasibility of the proposed
PAN 2D nanofibrous mats for the practical consideration for potential
remediation of industrial dye wastes and bacterial disinfection.

Experimental
Section
Materials and Methods

(Mw: 25 000), iron(III) acetylacetonate,
iron(III) oxide, 25% glutaraldehyde, and ethylenediamine (EDA) were
purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. N,N-Dimethyldodecylamine (97%), 1,5-dibromopentane (97%), and Hoechst
33342 were also procured from Sigma-Aldrich. Rhodamine B (Rho B) was
acquired from Life Technologies and 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide (MTT) was obtained from Amresco Life Science, and used as
per manufacture’s procedures. Dimethylformamide (DMF), congo
red (Mw = 696.68), ethyl alcohol, and
sodium hydroxide (NaOH) pellets were acquired from Sisco Research
Laboratories (SRL), India. Gram-positive bacterial strain S. aureus (microbial type culture collection (MTCC)
737) was obtained from IMTECH, India, and recombinant green fluorescence
protein expressing E. coli (GFP E. coli) was used as the gram-negative strain. Bacterial
growth medium such as Luria–Bertani and nutrient broth were
purchased from Merck (Germany) and Himedia (India), respectively.
Ampicillin antibiotic was procured from Sisco Research Laboratories
(SRL), India. Analytical grade chemicals and double-distilled water,
DDW (18.3 mΩ).

Electrospun PAN–PEI/Fe Nanofibers
Standard electrospinning
apparatus procured from ESPIN Nano (Physics Equipment and Company,
India) was used for the fabrication of nanofibers. Iron(III) acetylacetonate
(1%) and PEI (0.8%) were dissolved in 7% PAN–DMF solution under
constant magnetic stirring at 60 °C under 400 rpm for 12 h. After
curing, the polymer blend was fed into 2 mL syringe and fixed into
the electrospinning apparatus with an independent programmable peristaltic
microsyringe pump. The apparatus was operated at 14 kV with the flow
rate maintained between 0.40 and 0.45 mL/h, and the deposition of
nanofibers was prolonged for a stipulated time under room temperature
with a constant relative humidity of 55% and collected over grounded
stationary metal collector positioned at a distance of 14 cm from
the spinneret.

Fabrication of Iron Oxide Immobilized Nanoparticles
on the PAN–PEI
Nanofibers
The PAN–PEI/Fe composite nanofibers were
pretreated with glutaraldehyde (50% v/v) vapors for 2 h and dried
in hot air oven at 45 °C to remove the remnant unreacted glutaraldehyde
from the nanofibers. The cross-linked nanofibers were identified by
the colorimetric change in the mat from orange to brown, and then
it was UV sterilized before being carried over for further applications.
The nanofiber mat was initially immersed in 70 mL of deionized water
and the pH was adjusted to 10–11 using ethylenediamine (EDA)
and transferred to the Teflon-lined autoclave for hydrothermal treatment
at 150 °C for 12 h followed by repeated washing with deionized
water to remove the unreacted amine group and dried for further use.

Development of Magnetic-QA Complex
Synthesis of QA Complex
Quaternary ammonium complex
was synthesized as reported elsewhere,44 and the scheme for synthesis is elucidated in Figure S11. In brief, 37.8 mL of N,N-dimethyldodecylamine was added dropwise to 21.8 mL of
1,5-dibromopentane (0.14 mol each) at 60 °C under N2 atmosphere with constant magnetic stirring under reflux for 12 h
and the unreacted amine reagents were removed. The obtained yellowish
sticky compound was dissolved in 50 mL of ethanol and added to 0.1
g of PEI in ethanol at 70 °C under N2 atmosphere and
refluxed for 48 h continuously. The unreacted compounds were removed
by rotary evaporation to obtain QA compounds and stored in −20
°C before being used.

Preparation of Magnetic-QA Complex
Magnetic-QA complex
were prepared by a simple coating process. In brief, 0.5 g of QA compounds
was dissolved in 20 mL ethanol at 55 °C followed by the addition
of 1 g of Fe3O4 NPs under N2 atmosphere,
and the reaction was kept for 12 h to form magnetic-QA complex. Then,
it was magnetically separated and washed with deionized water and
dried.

Fabrication of Electrospun Magnetic-QA-Loaded
PAN Nanofibers
The magnetic-QA-loaded PAN polymer blend was
prepared by solvent
homogenization process. In brief, 20 mg of presynthesized magnetic-QA
complex was dissolved in DMF and sonicated for 10 min with a 3 s “on”
and 2 s “off” condition and added to the preprepared
7% PAN solution. The magnetic-QA-loaded polymer solution was electrospun
to form the continuous nanofibers onto the collector using the aforementioned
parameters.

Characterization of PAN/PEI–Fe Composite
Nanofibers and
Magnetic-QA-Loaded PAN Nanofibers
The morphologies of PAN–PEI/Fe
nanofibers, Fe3O4 NPs, magnetic-QA complex,
and magnetic-QA-loaded PAN nanofibers were analyzed by Ultra Plus-Carl
Zeiss (Germany) field emission-scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM)
operated at 15 kV and FE-SEM (FEI Quanta 200 F) equipped with energy-dispersive
X-ray (EDX) detector operated at an accelerating voltage of 15–20
keV. The nanofibers were gold coated for 80 s in Denton gold sputtering
unit before being mounted on FE-SEM stage. The nanofiber images were
processed by analysis software ImageJ to determine the mean diameter
and size distribution of the nanofibers. The morphology of the magnetic-QA
complex was studied by TEM (FEI Tecnai G2) at an operating voltage
200 kV. The functional changes in the nanomaterials were investigated
by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, where the measurements
were acquired by Thermo Nicolet spectrometer using KBr pellets in
the range between 4000 and 400 cm–1. Thermogravimetric
analysis of the nanofibers was carried out to study the thermal degradation
profile and their thermal stability by heating from 0 to 800 °C
at a constant rate of 10 °C/min under inert atmosphere using
the EXSTAR TG/DTA 6300 (Hitachi, Japan). The purity and crystalline
phase structure of the nanofiber mats were studied using advance powder
X-ray diffractometer (Bruker AXSD8) (Cu Kα radiation, λ
= 1.5406 Å), with θ value between 5 and 80° at a scan
speed of 0.2°/min. The magnetic behavior of the nanomaterials
was analyzed using a supraparamagnetic quantum interference diffractometer
(SQUID) with varying magnetic field from −50 000 to
+50 000 Oe. Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) measurements
studied the surface area and pore volume of magnetic-QA complex through
N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms recorded using
a Quantachrome NOVA 2200e high-speed automated surface area analyzer.

Batch Adsorption Studies
Stock solution (1000 mg/L)
of congo red dye was prepared and the desired concentrations were
prepared by serial dilution for the experiments. Batch adsorption
studies were conducted with contact time (0–180 min) at an
initial dye concentration (100 mg/L), and the nanofibrous adsorbent
of 20 mg was used in 20 mL of dye solution. Kinetics and isotherm
studies were carried out to investigate the adsorption mechanism of
the PAN–PEI/Fe nanofibers weighing 20 mg in an aqueous dye
solution. Earlier, the experimental conditions such as dye concentration,
equilibrium adsorption time, and temperature were predetermined and
the residual concentration of the dye was analyzed by UV–vis
spectrophotometer by measuring the absorbance at 500 nm. The quantity
of the CR dye adsorbed per unit mass of the nanofiber mats was determined
by the following equation Qe = (Ci – Cf)V/M, where Qe (mg/g) is the amount of dye adsorbed per gram of adsorbent at equilibrium, V is the volume of testing solution (L), and M is the weight of the adsorbent (g). Simulated dye solutions were
prepared by diluting the stock using deionized water having aliquots
of varying concentrations (20, 40, and 60 mg/L). The desorption study
was carried out by immersing the dye-adsorbed nanofiber mats into
10 mL of 0.1 M NaOH solution for 3 h, and adsorption test was repeated
for further cycles after thorough washing. Similarly, the reusability
study was conducted without any postchemical treatment after subsequent
adsorption and monitored for 10 repeated cycles.

Disinfection
Studies
Bacterial Sample Preparation
Stock cultures of a recombinant
green fluorescence protein expressing E. coli (GFP E. coli) and S. aureus (MTCC 737) acquired from IMTECH, India,
are the bacterial models used for the study. The secondary cultures
were reinoculated into fresh medium and grown until OD at 600 nm reaches
0.3 with cell population of approximately 2.4 × 108 CFU/mL; it was further serial diluted having different cell numbers
ranging from 108 to 103 CFU/mL. The information
related to the different formulations of nanofibers of having different
concentrations of QA loaded is extensively illustrated in the Supporting Information (Table S1), and sample 3 was used for all of the disinfection experiments;
as a precautionary measure, all of the glasswares used in the experiments
were sterilized at 121 °C for 20 min before usage.

Microscopic
Analysis
The control and treated bacterial
cultures (number of cells ∼108–107 CFU/mL) are resuspended in deionized water followed by imaging through
a fluorescence microscope to differentiate the bacterial population
in the control and the treated samples operated at 100× magnification.

Bacterial Killing Test by Colony-Counting Method
To
quantify the disinfection efficacy of the nanofibers, the bacterial
cultures of different cell density (108–103 CFU/mL as mentioned earlier) in the vials were used as control,
whereas 30 μL of culture from each vial was inoculated into
the fresh media containing nanofibers (1 cm × 1 cm dimension)
followed by incubation for 8 h at 37 °C and plated on agar plates
for the growth of bacterial colonies. The conventional colony-counting
method was adopted to determine the bacterial removal efficiency of
the magnetic-QA-loaded PAN nanofibers by enumerating the number of
colonies grown in the plates. The disinfection efficiency (%) of the
nanofiber was evaluated by the equation as follows:  where CFUi and
CFUf are
the initial and final number of bacterial colonies grown in the plates,
respectively.

Disinfection Experiments by Disk Diffusion
Method
Cultures
of S. aureus and GFP E. coli grown overnight were streaked over the agar
plates and, subsequently, three different types of nanofiber mats
of diameter 13 mm each were placed and kept for incubation at 37 °C
for 24 h. The antibacterial action was visualized by the inhibition
of bacterial lawn in a circular path and the efficacy was evaluated
by measuring the diameter of the disk. The experiments were performed
in triplicates to overcome the artifacts present in the circular nanofiber
disks, and the mean diameter was used for the evaluation.

MTT Assay
Cell lines BHK-21 and NIH 3T3 were procured
from the cell repository of National Centre for Cell Science, India.
Cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s
medium (high-glucose) medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum,
50 U/mL penicillin, and 50 mg/mL streptomycin in a humidified atmosphere
in 5% CO2 at 37 °C. MTT assay was performed on animal
cell lines using the procedures mentioned elsewhere45 to substantiate the biocompatibility of the different types
of nanofibers such as QA-loaded PAN nanofibers, combined use of QA
and magnetic-QA-loaded nanofibers with varying concentrations of QA
loaded onto PAN nanofibers (discussed earlier in the Supporting Information), and the PAN–PEI/Fe nanofibers.
The morphology of the treated cells was captured by EVOS cell imaging
system (Life Technologies) with red and blue filters, respectively.

Animal Toxicity Experiments
Danio rerio (zebrafish) embryos (ASWT strain) obtained from the Institute of
Genomics and Integrated Biology, Delhi, was used for the study. The
fresh embryos were collected onto the microinjection embryo tray just
before the experiment, and the nanofiber samples of different formulations
consisting of different concentrations of the QA loaded on to the
PAN nanofibers (samples 1–4) and the PAN–PEI/Fe nanofiber
were used. A 24-well plate was filled with 4 mL of water in each well
as the medium for the growth of the zebrafish embryos. A total of
10 embryos in each well were used with duplicates, and the percentage
survival of embryos was determined by counting the number of live
fish after every 24 h. The microinjected embryos were transferred
onto the Petri dish filled with system water and incubated at 28 °C
in the dark. For the in vivo toxicity tests, live embryos were counted
each day until 144 hpf. After 144 hpf, the developed embryos were
live imaged by using Leica M205 FA attached with Leica DFC-7000 T
camera without using tricaine methane sulfonate to visualize any phenotypic
changes. All of the images were captured by Planapo 2.0× objective
lens.
