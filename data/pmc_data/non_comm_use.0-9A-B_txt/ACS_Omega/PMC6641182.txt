This article is devoted to the theoretical
study of the effects
of a connection pattern and stereo hindrance of different π-bridges,
nitrogen-containing donors, and boron-containing acceptors on the
electrooptic properties of NB-type electronic asymmetric compounds
in conventional D−π–A frameworks by the density
functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent DFT (TD-DFT) approaches.
By introducing three different connection groups (−O–,
−CH2–, and −CMe2−)
and guided by structural rationality, we formed 30 NB-type molecules,
which have been classified into four types: D−π–A,
D–X1−π–A, D−π–X1–A,
and D–X1−π–X2–A (Xn are connection groups). Then, the energy gaps (ΔEST) between the first singlet and triplet excited states
were evaluated by TD-LC-ωPBE with the optimal values of ω*,
as well as an approximate method, which only considers the interaction
between highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied
molecular orbital (LUMO). It is found that for the compounds with
strong vibronic coupling, the calculated ΔEST defined as the difference of vertical excitation energies
largely deviates from the experimental result. The consistency between
the estimated and experimental values indicates that ΔEST is predominantly determined by the frontier
molecular orbitals, which can be tuned by adjusting the modular overlap
between HOMO and LUMO or the orientation of the donor and acceptor
groups. Accompanied with the other electronic and optical properties,
our study suggests that the interaction mode, D−π–X1–A,
the modified D−π–A system with a rigidly fixed
acceptor and a relatively free donor, can serve as a valuable molecular
design pattern for new blue-colored thermally activated delayed fluorescence
(TADF) emitters. Specifically, our calculations predict that ARD-BZN-2CMe2-PYN and its relatives might have excellent potential as TADF
emitters.

1 Introduction
Thermally
activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) materials have
been intensively explored as one of the most promising third-generation
electrofluorescence materials for applications in modern organic light-emitting
diode (OLED) devices in recent years.1−10 An OLED is a light-emitting diode (LED) in which the emissive electroluminescent
layer is a film of an organic compound that emits light in response
to an electric current. Since the first big breakthrough of Tang and
VanSlyke in 1987,11 the materials and efficiency
of OLEDs have been improved profoundly.4,12−15 In recent years, OLEDs have been used to create digital displays
in devices such as television screens, computer monitors, and portable
systems such as mobile phones, handheld game consoles, and personal
digital assistants.7,12,16

The functioning of OLED relies on the electrofluorescence
process.16 Upon electronic injection, there
is a 3:1 generation
of triplet and singlet excitons in OLEDs.17 Owing to the spin-forbidden effect between the triplet excited state
and singlet ground state, the triplet excitons get wasted as thermal
energy; thus, only a maximum of 25% internal quantum efficiency (IQE)
can be expected for conventional fluorescence material-based devices.
Through exploitation of the spin–orbit interaction in rare
transition metal organic complexes, the IQE of phosphorescent materials
can surpass the 75% statistic limit in well-tuned devices. To break the limit of the spin
statistics and achieve nearly 100% IQE, scientists have proposed two
approaches, one is “singlet-trapping” and the other
is “triplet-trapping”.12 The
singlet-trapping method utilizes phosphorescence materials (typically,
organometallic compounds with heavy transition metal centers) to convert
the singlet excitons to triplet excitons through efficient intersystem
crossing (ISC) induced by a strong spin–orbit coupling effect,18,19 so as to emit light from the emissive triplet excited state totally.16 However, the triplet-trapping method utilizes
delayed fluorescence materials (typically, organic compounds with
very low singlet–triplet energy gaps) to convert the triplet
excitons to singlet excitons through efficient reverse intersystem
crossing (rISC) induced by thermal activation, so as to emit light
from the emissive singlet excited state. Upon careful exploitation
of these methods, near 100% IQE can be achieved.7

Full color and white-light displays need efficient
OLEDs that emit
three basic colors (red, green, and blue).12,16 Currently, high-performance blue-light OLEDs are the final piece
to pursue for industrial applications of the technology. Considering
the rareness and high cost of heavy transition metal complexes, though
the efficiency might be promising, the economics might not be so attractive.
Therefore, the design and investigation of TADF emitters with a low
energy gap and high emission energy (in blue color) are still in great
need for future replacement of the expensive phosphorescence emitters
in high-performance OLED devices.4 Basically,
two classes of TADF-emitting materials have been intensively investigated,
the first one is transition metal organic complexes bearing saturated
d10 configuration to diminish the possible dπ–dπ*
transition quenching loss, the other is pure organic polycyclic aromatic
compounds.20−24

Through building models and performing numerical simulations,
researchers
have found that the vibronic coupling effect, the regio- and conformational
isomerization, and the dynamic nature of excited states might play
important roles in determining the fitness of TADF materials.25−27 Recently, 10H-phenoxaborin derivatives have been
designed and tested as high-efficiency blue TADF materials in OLEDs,28,29 whose frameworks can be either asymmetric D−π–A
(or D–A) or symmetric D–A–D. It has been observed
that the steric hindrance arising from the hydrogen–hydrogen
(H–H) interaction, as shown in Figure 1, is vital for such NB-type molecules as
TADF emitters. The term “NB-type” indicates the intrinsic
structural characteristic of the compound, which is basically composed
of a nitrogen-containing donor and a boron-containing acceptor interconnected
by a π-bridge. Through borylation of 1,3-phenyloxybenzene, and
subsequently connecting it with phenoxazine, the resulting NB-type
structure can be a valid TADF emitter.30 Under steric constrains, planarized triarylboranes could be rather
stable compounds;31,32 therefore, they might be valuable
structural units for the construction of new TADF materials. In the
present work, we theoretically studied the effects of a connection
pattern and stereo hindrance of different π-bridges, donors,
and acceptors on the electrooptic properties in conventional D−π–A
frameworks, by the density functional theory (DFT)33 and time-dependent DFT (TD-DFT) method.34 Through introduction of three different connection groups
(−O–, −CH2–, and −CMe2−), and guided by structural rationality, 30 NB-type
molecules, as shown in Figure 2, have been constructed, which can be classified into four
types: D−π–A (1–2), D–X1−π–A (3–10), D−π–X1–A (11–26), and D–X1−π–X2–A (27–30), where Xn denotes
connection groups. Their singlet–triplet energy gaps, ΔEST, will be evaluated by the range-separated
DFT LC-ωPBE with the optimal value of ω.35−38 On the basis of ΔEST, absorption/emission
energies, and corresponding oscillator strengths, the possibility
of utilizing NB-type electronic asymmetric compounds as potential
TADF materials was evaluated.

2 Theoretical Methods
The TADF process proceeds by rISC from the triplet to singlet excited
states and relies on relatively small energy differences between singlet
and triplet excited states. Therefore, ΔEST and ES1 are the basic
quantities used to determine the quality of the compound to be viewed
as potential TADF materials. Benchmark tests on existent delayed fluorescence
molecules have shown that conventional DFT XC functionals (e.g., LDA,
GGA, hybrid B3LYP, etc.) typically are not suitable to predict these
excited-state properties correctly and consistently. However, through
a fine tune of the range separation of the DFT exchange and pure Hartree–Fock
exchange under the generalized Kohn–Sham framework, DFT becomes
trustable to give a reliable prediction on the excited-state properties.36−38 In these long-range-corrected (LRC) DFT functionals, the amount
of exact exchange is weighted according to the interelectron distance
(r12) as , where  and erfc(x) = 1 –
erf(x). For a given system, the optimal ω value
can be obtained without empirical fitting by minimizing the function39 1  In donor–acceptor systems, it is useful
to focus not only on the ionization potential (essentially related
to the donor component) but also on the electron affinity (essentially
related to the acceptor component). Electron affinity (i.e., in the
absence of geometry relaxation) of the N electron
system can be considered as the ionization potential of the N + 1 electron system. In this context, the tuning of the
ω value can be done by minimizing the following equation39 2  Here, ϵHOMO and IP denote
the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy and ionization
potential, respectively.

In this study, we then calculated ΔEST and ES1 by TD-DFT/6-31+G(d,p)
with the optimally tuned range-separated functional, LC-ωPBE37,38 (abbreviated as LC-ω*PBE). The Tamm–Dancoff approximation
(TDA)40,41 to TD-DFT was adopted. TD-LC-ω*PBE
with TDA had been benchmarked to be able to give reliable prediction
for ΔEST in organic TADF emitters.42 The root-mean-square errors can be as low as
0.10 eV; this level of accuracy is crucial for the quantitative theoretical
prediction of TADF molecules. Similarly, by using the tuned range-separated
LC-BLYP functional at the TDA framework, Penfold demonstrated that
the special tuned functional can give a rather trustable prediction
of singlet–triplet gaps for TDAF molecules.43 For the applicability of TDA in predicting such excited
state properties, refer to the prominent works of Peach et al.44,45 To show how to obtain the optimal range-separation parameter, ω*,
we took ARD-BZN–2O-DPB (13) as an example to tune
ω*, as shown in Figure S1. The related
details can be found in the Supporting Information (SI). The optimal parameter values of ω* for all of the
studied compounds were predicted to be in a rather narrow range of
0.15–0.19 bohr–1, as shown in Table 1. If not specifically stated, ES1 and ΔEST in this work are the vertical excitation energies corresponding
to the transition of S0 → S1 and the
energy difference between the vertical excitation energies of S0 → S1 and S0 → T1 transitions, respectively. Although adiabatic quantities are of
experimental importance, the computational cost is prohibitively too
high to be usable for a large system. Thus, in the present work, we
only calculated the adiabatic excitation energies for some selected
systems.

To
characterize the excited state, we calculated the transferred
charge (qCT) and the charge-transfer (CT)
distance (DCT) corresponding to the transition
of S0 → S1. These calculations were carried
out at the theoretical level of TD-ωB97XD/6-31+G(d,p). By following
Le Bahers and Jacquemin,46,47 we define qCT = ∫ρ+(r) dr or ∫ρ–(r)  dr and DCT = |R+ – R–|. Two functions,
ρ+(r) and ρ–(r), defining the points in space corresponding
to density depletion and the density increment zones 3   4  Here, Δρ(r) =
ρEX(r) – ρGS(r) denotes the difference in charge densities between
the corresponding excited state and ground state.

The barycenters
of the spatial regions defined by ρ+(r) and ρ–(r), referred in
the following as R+ and R–, can thus be defined as 5   6  The spatial distance between the two barycenters
of density distributions can thus be used to measure the CT excitation
length, DCT.

The ground-state geometric
optimizations of all of the studied
systems in the gas phase were finished at the theoretical level of
B3LYP/6-311G(d,p). To calculate the adiabatic excitation energies
of some selected compounds, the geometries of T1 and S1 are required, which were obtained at theoretical levels of
UωB97X-D/6-31+G(d,p) and TD-ωB97X-D/6-31+G(d,p), respectively.
Owing to the CT characters of S1, the LRC-DFT XC functional,
ωB97X-D, should be more suitable than the conventional hybrid
functional, B3LYP. In addition, for some selected compounds, we also
simulated their related electrooptic properties (including the vertical
absorption and emission characteristics, etc.) in the solution phase,
wherein the solvent effect was taken into account by the polarizable
continuum model (PCM, solvent = toluene).48

All of the calculations were performed within the Gaussian
09 software
package.49

3 Results
and Discussion
As stated in Section 1, the main purpose of this study is to explore
how the geometric
and electronic characteristics affect the electrooptic properties
(tuning the energy gap and first singlet excited energy) and eventually
change the appropriateness of the compounds as TADF emitters. Indeed,
we observed that the connection pattern and steric hindrance greatly
affect the electrooptic properties of the studied systems.

Thirty
NB-type molecules have been constructed through the introduction
of three different connection groups (−O–, −CH2–, and −CMe2−). Figure 2 shows the classification of
the compounds and the correspondence between structures and names.
Because the IUPAC names are tedious and inconvenient to refer to,
we denote them by shorthand names and ordinal numbers. Three symbols
are used to denote donors (ARD, PXZ, and DPA), three symbols for acceptors
(PXB, DPB, and PYN), symbol BZN for the central benzene ring, and
symbols −O–, −CH2–, and −CMe2– for the connection groups.

3.1 ES1, ET1, and ΔEST
ΔEST and ES1 are the basic quantities
used to evaluate the quality of combined compounds as TADF emitters. Table 1 collects these two
quantities as well as the corresponding oscillator strengths (f). Empirically, the energy gap is related to the efficiency
to convert the triplet exciton to the singlet one through rISC induced
by thermal activation, so as to emit light from the emissive singlet
excited state to the ground state. This obeys the Arrhenius form,
that is, the smaller the energy gap, the higher the efficiency. A
very large ΔEST would correspond
to a rather low-efficiency rISC and hence an unacceptable internal
(and external) quantum efficiency. ES1 can provide a good estimate of the emission color, although
it is exactly the absorption energy, and the emission energy of a
compound is usually smaller than its absorption energy. Because we
are basically interested in designing blue emitting compounds, ES1 must be in an appropriate range.
In this study, we have adopted the following two criteria to assess
the appropriateness of the compounds as TADF emitters: (1) ΔEST ≤ 0.30 eV; (2) ES1 ≥ 3.0 eV.

With neglect of more details,
the trends of ΔEST and ES1 across different connection groups in the
toluene solution and in the gas phase are very similar; hence, we
will mainly discuss the data in the gas phase. We have the following
observation:(a) For each class, the variation of ΔEST is relatively small. The compounds within
type D−π–X1–A (11–26) possess the smallest values of ΔEST, which lie in the range of 0.01–0.24 eV, those
in D–X1−π–X2–A (27–30) have the largest energy gap value of 0.41–0.55
eV, and those in D−π–A (1 and 2) and D–X1−π–A (3–10) have the values of 0.32–0.44 eV.

(b) For the compounds in D−π–X1–A
(D and A fixed; X1 = −CH2–, −CMe2–, and −O−), the introduction of more
electronegative −O– connection typically enlarges the
ΔEST gap, and the difference between
ΔEST for the compounds with the
connections of −CH2– and −CMe2– is rather small as expected.

(c) ES1 differs
considerably for the four classes: D−π–X1–A
having relatively lower excitation energies of 2.91–3.28 eV,
D−π–A bearing the largest ones, D–X1−π–A
(with exception compound 8) having relatively higher
energies (3.06–3.47 eV), and D–X1−π–X2–A
having the values of 2.90–3.49 eV. The existence of PXZ or
an −O– connection generally displays low excitation
energies.

(d) f corresponding to
S0 → S1 transition differs apparently
for the four classes: D–X1−π–A and D–X1−π–X2–A
being strong (>0.10), D−π–A being weak (0.0013–0.0028),
and D−π–X1–A being negligible (essential
0).



The first two compounds (1 and 2) in
type D−π–A are experimentally verified valid TADF
emitters, with experimentally measured energy gaps of 0.013 and 0.028
eV, respectively.28 The calculated ΔEST values in the gas phase based on the vertical
excitation energies approach around 0.4 eV, which are apparently inconsistent
with the experimental measurement. This highlights the fact that ΔEST values calculated on the basis of the vertical
excitation energies are not a suitable measurement to the real singlet–triplet
energy gaps for the compounds whose ground and excited states differ
profoundly from each other. The compounds 1 and 2 bearing relatively free donor or acceptor groups do undergo
a considerable structural change upon the electronic excitation, as
shown in Table S1. We thus calculated energy
gaps on the basis of the adiabatic excitation energies for some selected
compounds, which are shown in Tables 1 and S2. The calculated
adiabatic energy gaps denoted by ΔESTadi are ∼0.2
eV for the first two compounds, which are much smaller than the vertical
energy gaps and are closer to the experimental data. Obviously, the
adiabatic and vertical ΔEST can
exhibit very distinctive behaviors for different patterns. For example,
for several compounds (11 and 12, 14 and 15, and 19 and 20) belonging to D−π–X1–A, the adiabatic
gaps are larger than the corresponding vertical ones. But the sizes
of the gaps are typically lower than 0.20 eV. Thus, they have a great
chance to fulfill the gap requirement of TADF emitters. Compound 16 in type D−π–X1–A is also an
experimentally verified valid TADF emitter.30 However, for this compound, the calculated vertical ΔEST is 0.09 eV in the gas phase, agreeing well
with the experimental value of 0.06 eV, indicating that for this one-side
fixed class, D−π–X1–A, the difference between
the calculated vertical and adiabatic energy gaps is relatively small,
and the vertical ΔEST seems to be
a reasonable estimation of the real ΔEST.

For most of the studied compounds, their first singlet
excited
states mainly come from the electronic transitions from HOMO to lowest
unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) and nearby frontier MOs (see Table S3), and they possess obvious CT characters,
indicated by the difference of charge densities shown in Figure 3 and the charge distribution
of HOMO and LUMO shown in Figure S2. For
the first two compounds, their HOMOs and LUMOs occupy distinct spatial
regions and have a very small overlap. However, for these two compounds,
the contribution from HOMO → LUMO + 2 transitions is also significant.
Through the connection between the donor and π-bridge, the compounds 3–5 in the D–X1−π–A
series display a more extensive electron distribution in the HOMOs.
The compounds 11–16, 19–21, and 24–26 in the D−π–X1–A series differ from those
in D–X1−π–A, in that they bear more extensive
distribution in the LUMOs. The overlap region for the compounds in
the D−π–X1–A and D−π–A
series is smaller than that for those in the D–X1−π–A
series.

Figure 3 Diagrams for the difference of charge densities between the excited
states and ground state for selected compounds.

The orbital diagram is confirmed by the values of modular
overlap
Λ shown in Table 2. Λ, defined by Λ = ∫|ψH(r)||ψL(r)| dr, is the overlap between HOMO and LUMO. In addition, Table 2 also shows the average
separation distance between HOMO and LUMO (ΔrHL = |rH – rL| with ) and the
estimated energy gaps denoted
by ΔEST(est). On the basis of Λ

the differences between the estimated and calculated energy gaps has
been given in the SI.

The CT distance (DCT)
experiences small
variations across the four classes. D−π–A bears
relatively large values of ∼14.0 Å, and D–X1−π–X2–A
holds relatively small ones (∼10.0 Å). This can be understood
by the difference in conjugation (planar) and the electron–sufficient
(or deficient) character. The CT charge (qCT) gives a clear contrast among the four classes. The largest values
exist for D−π–A and D−π–X1–A
(>1.20e–), and the others hold
low values (<0.90e–). The large
difference between D−π–X1–A and D–X1−π–A
should have deep roots in their geometric and electronic structures.

To summarize this subsection: ΔEST and ES1 exhibit different
behaviors across the four classes. The compounds in the D−π–X1–A
series consistently display rather low ΔEST values of <0.30 eV, and the energy gap can be qualitatively
understood by the difference in the modular overlap between HOMO and
LUMO, because S1 is predominately contributed by the electronic
transitions from HOMO to LUMO.

3.2 Emission
Characteristic
As fluorescence
materials, their emission channel from S1 to S0 must open according to Kasha’s rule; thus, the corresponding
oscillator strength should have considerable size. In Section 3.1, the assessment of the
appropriateness as the TADF emitter candidate is based on the vertical
excitation energy. Although the absorption and emission spectra usually
have mirror symmetry for the molecules without the structure’s
flexibility, in real systems, especially in the molecules whose geometries
are flexible, the vibronic coupling usually is very strong and the
emissive properties can be significantly different from the absorption
properties. In principle, the best blue-color TADF emitter candidates
should be those bearing possibly the smallest energy gap and the highest
excitation energy, in addition to a large-enough oscillator strength.
In reality, a trade-off between ΔEST and f must be adopted. Considering the criteria
of ΔEST < 0.30 eV, only the compounds 1–2 and 11–26 in the D−π–A and D−π–X1–A
series seem to have a chance. However, as shown in Table 1, the absorption oscillator
strengths corresponding to S0 → S1 transitions
for the compounds in D−π–X1–A at S0 geometries are essentially zero. Here, we thus examine the
emission behaviors of these systems.

The common structural character
for compounds 11–26 in the D−π–X1–A
series is that they have a relatively free donor (ARD or PXZ) (see Figure 2), which has been
confirmed by the geometric parameters shown in Table S1. In S0, dihedral angles D1 of the compounds in D−π–X1–A typically
are ∼90°, whereas those in S1 are ∼70°.
The reduction of D1 upon photoexcitation (or possibly
electric excitation) enhances the conjugation of the compounds and
should play a crucial role in their emission behaviors.

Table 3 shows the
emission energy and the corresponding oscillator strength. Because
S1 possesses a CT character, TD-ωB97XD will be adopted
to optimize S1 geometries, and the emission energy was
calculated by several DFT functionals (TD-B3LYP, TD-ωB97XD,
TD-LC-ωPBE, and TDA-LC-ω*PBE), on the basis of the optimized
S1 geometry. It is noted that:(a) With the same geometries, different
DFT functionals give apparently different emission energies, and the
variation can be larger than 1 eV. Compared with the experimental
data, the conventional hybrid functional, TD-B3LYP, seems to underestimate Eemi, TD-LC-ωPBE tends to overestimate Eemi, and TD-ωB97XD and TDA-LC-ω*PBE
produce a more reasonable Eemi.

(b) Considering the results
produced by
TDA-LC-ω*PBE as the standard, the compounds in D-π–X1–A
can have comparable emission energies to those in D−π–A,
and can span a large energy range. The compounds with an ARD donor
typically give a higher emission energy than those with PXZ. For the
compounds with the same donor and acceptor in D−π–X1–A,
the effect of connection group X1 on Eemi is small.

(c) All TD-DFT
methods predict that the
emission channel for the compounds in D−π–X1–A
is open, except for those with the connection −2O–.
The compounds in D−π–X1–A (11–26) and D−π–A (1 and 2) have relatively smaller oscillator strengths
compared to those in D–X1−π–A (3–5).

The calculated f values of all of
the compounds
in type D−π–2O–A are zero. However, it
is known that compound PXZ-BZN-2O-DPB (16) does emit
light.30 The discrepancy between the theory
and experiment might come from the neglecting of the non-Condon effect
and the exclusion of the molecular environmental effect in the theoretical
calculation. In the gas phase, the compounds in D−π–2O–A
have a quasiorthogonal geometry in both S0 and S1 (D1 are near 90°). This type of molecular
symmetry usually attributes S1 to be a dark state.

The rate constant (kTADF) of TADF emission is another criterion to assess
TADF emitters. It has been established that there exist various radiative
and nonradiative processes for the TADF emitter after electric excitation.
Moreover, currently, the theoretical calculation of all of the related
processes is not feasible especially for medium- to large-sized molecular
systems. Nevertheless, under certain assumptions, kTADF can be estimated by the following equation51 7  where e is the elementary
charge, n is the refractive index of the material, me is the mass of electron, c is the speed of light in vacuum, kB is
the Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature.
Because the geometries of S1 and T1 might be
close to each other, and the T1 structure can be obtained
via unrestricted optimization in the triplet manifold with relatively
more cost compared to that in ground-state optimization, here we use
T1 geometries to replace those of S1 in the
calculation of kTADF. The vertical excitation
energy (ES1(T1))
and the corresponding oscillator strength (f(T1)) based on the optimized T1 geometry, in addition
to the estimated rate constants of kTADF, have been tabulated in Table 4.

a kTADF (in unit of μs–1) is the estimated rate
constant for TADF emission, at the temperature T =
298.15 K and refractive index n = 1.00.

ES1(T1) of D−π–X1–A
compounds can span a range from 2.71 eV (PXZ-BZN-2CMe2-DPB)
to 3.05 eV (ARD-BZN-2O-PYN), and this characteristic is valuable in
realizing the appropriate emission color in devices. We also note
that the introduction of −O– groups makes the emission
energy blue-shifted weakly. All compounds have large emission strengths
(f(T1) > 0.10). The difference in kTADF is large and is predominately determined
by ΔEST. The lifetime of some compounds
can be several hundreds of μs. The D−π–X1–A
series display great contrast (f vs f(T1)) in Tables 1 and 4, which might be associated with
the geometric change between the ground and excited states (the reduction
of the dihedral D1).

Electronic properties
such as ionization potential and electron
affinity are important experimentally measurable quantities for optoelectronic
materials. For computational details of these quantities, refer to Figure S5 and related contents in SI. They are calculated at the B3LYP/6-311G(d,p)
level of theory. This level should be sufficient to give quantitative
predictions. To account for the trade-off between the energy gap and
oscillator strength, we have included a scatterplot between the two
quantities in Figure S6, where ΔEST is the vertical energy gap in the gas phase
(from Table 1), and f is the emission oscillator strength based on the T1 structure (partly in Table 4). Obviously, there is no simple proportionality relationship
between the two quantities. In accordance with our conceptual classification
of the compounds into four classes, the D−π–X1–A
class located in the left-lower corner of the region (small ΔEST and acceptable f) seems
to be in a good position overcoming the trade-off.

In a typical
setup of an OLED device, the emitters are doped in
the emission layer with a relatively low weight ratio (∼0.10).
Thus, the charge transportation mobility is vital for charge equilibrium
in this guest–host emission layer. Crudely, the mobility is
dominated by the electron extraction potential (EEP), hole extraction
potential (HEP), hole recombination energy (λh),
and electron recombination energy (λe). We have tabulated
these quantities in Table S4.

Because
the studied compounds are very similar from a structural
point of view, they exhibit comparable IP(v), IP(a), HEP, EA(v), EA(a),
and EEP. The variation in λh and λe is also small, and they are comparable in size. Therefore, these systems would
exhibit a good charge equilibrium, which is preferable for a realistic
design of the emitters. For future comparison with experimental data,
the simulated UV–vis absorption spectra of selected compounds
in toluene at the B3LYP/6-31+G(d,p)/PCM level of theory have been
provided in Figure S7.

To summarize,
these D−π–X1–A compounds
are predicted to be valid blue- (or green-) color emitters, given
compounds 1 and 2 as the reference. Because
they also obey other requirements of TADF emitters (low ΔEST, open emission channel), they might be potential
candidates for applications in OLEDs. Specifically, our calculations
predict that ARD-BZN-2CMe2-PYN and its relatives might
have excellent potential as TADF emitters.

3.3 Tuning
ΔEST via the Frontier Orbital Overlap
and Group Substitution
As described in Section 3.1, the energy gap of ΔEST is very much dependent on the overlap and
energy levels of frontier
MOs. It is thus possible to tune ΔEST through altering the orientation of the donor and acceptor and through
applying the group substitution of interacting H-atoms. For example,
the notable difference between S0 geometries for the compounds
in the D–X1−π–A (3–10) and D−π–X1–A (11–26) series is that the former assumes mediate-size
dihedral angle D2 (∼50°) between the
acceptor and π-bridge, whereas the latter holds quasiorthogonal
dihedral angle D1 (∼90°) between the
donor and π-bridge (see Table S1).
This small structural change has profound impact on the electrooptic
properties of the compounds as shown above. We then vary the dihedral
angles D1 (or D2) to check how ΔEST and Λ vary with D1
(or D2).

Figure 4 shows the dependence for representative compound 4 in the D–X1−π–A series and compounds 12 and 24 in the D−π–X1–A
series. The restricted optimization was used by starting from the
full-optimized geometry and fixing the dihedral angle, D1 (or D2), from 30 to 90° with a step-size
of 5°. For all of the compounds, ΔEST decreases with the increase of D2 (or D1) from 30 to 90° at apparently different speeds,
suggesting that one can tune the energy gap of the compound via tuning
the orientation of the donor and the acceptor. ΔEST values of compound 4 are always larger
than 0.20 eV, whereas those of the latter two compounds are lower
than 0.15 eV when D1 changes from 65 to 90°.
Λ experiences a smooth drop for all of the three compounds.
It is obvious that the compounds in the D–X1−π–A
and D−π–X1–A series might exhibit very
different performances as TADF emitters.

of ΔEST and Λ for compounds 4, 12, and 14 in the gas phase.

Considering that compounds 1 (ARD-BZN-PXB) and 2 (PXZ-BZN-PXB) are experimentally
verified valid TADF emitters,
it would be valuable to further explore new structures on the basis
of them being potential TADF materials. It is repeatedly experienced
that the electrooptic properties (especially the energy gap, ΔEST) are rather sensitive to the changes on the
basic frameworks, for example, a single nitrogen replacement on the
linking benzene bridge would profoundly shift the excitation energy
and markedly change the ΔEST. In
the next subsection, we restrict to examine the changes introduced
by group substitution of the interacting hydrogen atoms on two compounds,
where only di-substitution at the same side via F, Cl, and OMe (methoxy
group) was considered. The substitution positions, -a, -b, -c, and
-d, have been used to distinguish them, where -a denotes the positions
of two H atoms on the donor (ARD or PXZ), -b denotes the two H atoms
on the benzene next to the donor, -c denotes the two H atoms on the
benzene next to the acceptor (PXB), -d denotes the two H atoms on
the acceptor.

The computed optical and electronic properties
of substituted ARD-BZN-PXB
and PXZ-BZN-PXB in the gas phase have been presented in Table 5. From the data, we observed
that:(a) The energy
gap, ΔEST, exhibits very different
behaviors across the four
substitution positions (-a, -b, -c, and -d). This behavior holds for
all three substitution groups without regard to their donor or acceptor
character.

(b) With regard
to different positions,
substitution at the -b position always gives the lowest ΔEST, and substitution at the -a position generally
gives the highest ΔEST.

(c) Consider all -b substituted
compounds,
Cl substitution gives the lowest energy gap, whereas F and OMe give
comparable energy gaps.

(d) The decrease in energy gaps can be
mainly associated with the drop in the singlet state energy, whereas
the triplet state energy seems stable under such kind of substitutions.

In short, through simple
substitution of interacting H atoms on
the basic frameworks (ARD-BZN-PXB and PXZ-BZN-PXB), the electrooptic
properties can be appropriately tuned to fit the requirement of TADF
emitters. Hence, substitution at specific positions can be a valuable
strategy to optimize TADF materials when lead compounds are available.

4 Conclusions
By using the DFT and TD-DFT approaches,
we have investigated the
effects of the connection pattern and stereo hindrance of different
π-bridges, donors, and acceptors on the electrooptic properties
of four classes of NB-type compounds (D−π–A, D–X1−π–A,
D−π–X1–A, and D–X1−π–X2–A).
On the basis of ΔEST, as well as
absorption/emission energies and properties, the possibility of utilizing
NB-type electronic asymmetric compounds as potential TADF materials
was evaluated. The following conclusions have been made.(1) For compounds with
strong vibronic
coupling, the calculated ΔEST values
by TD-DFT in the gas phase largely deviate from the experimental values.
To reproduce the experimental value, the photo-induced geometrical
changes and the realistic molecular environments should be taken into
account.

(2) Qualitatively,
the energy gap is predominately
determined by the frontier MO overlap and energy levels. The dependence
of the energy gap across different interaction modes can be mainly
attributed to the difference in modular overlap between HOMO and LUMO,
because the first singlet excited states arise basically by HOMO to
LUMO transitions and possess considerable intramolecular CT character.

(3) The effect of the orientation
of the
donor and acceptor on the energy gap, ΔEST, is significant. ΔEST varies
with the torsion of the structural framework and group substitution.
The basic structural frameworks might determine the quality and behavior
of the combined compounds, and group substitution would further modify
the quality in a small manner.

(4) The reduction of the dihedral angle
(D1) between the donor and π-bridge in D−π–X1–A
molecules from ∼90° in S0 to ∼70°
in S1 increases the mixing of localized excitation and
CT excitation and thus enhances the emissive rate.



To sum up, we suggest that the interaction mode, D−π–X1–A,
the modified D−π–A system with a rigidly fixed
acceptor and a relatively free donor, can serve as a valuable molecular
design pattern for new blue-color TADF emitters. Specifically, our
calculations predict that ARD-BZN-2CMe2-PYN and its relatives
might have excellent potential as TADF emitters.
