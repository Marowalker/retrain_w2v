Polyacrylonitrile
(PAN) fibers containing various concentrations
of graphene nanoplatelets (GNPs) were prepared by pressurized gyration,
and carbon nanofibers (CNFs) were obtained after subsequent heat treatment
and spark plasma sintering (SPS). The influence of processing parameters
such as rotational speed, working pressure, carbonization, and SPS
temperature on the diameter of the nanofibers has been studied. Furthermore,
the thermal properties, morphologies, and crystallization properties
of the CNFs have been investigated by using thermogravimetry, scanning
and transmission electron microscopy, and Raman spectroscopy. Also,
the electrical conductivity and the mechanical properties of these
samples have been studied. The results suggest that the gyration conditions
and the loading concentration of the GNPs significantly modified the
properties of the nanofibers.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Carbon nanofibers 
(CNFs) are very promising materials in comparison to carbon fibers
because of their nanostructure and superior properties. CNFs are used
in many applications such as electrical devices and sensors, electrode
materials for lithium-ion batteries, microbial fuel cells and high-performance
supercapacitors, catalysts or catalyst supports, and selective adsorption
agents.1−7 Polyacrylonitrile (PAN) has been extensively studied for making
carbon nanofibers because of its advantages of having a high carbon
yield, compared with other polymers, and being relatively inexpensive.8−10

There are two common methods for fabricating CNFs: one is
chemical
vapor deposition, and the other is electrospinning followed by carbonization.
Even though electrospinning is a well-established technique to generate
a wide variety of polymeric fibers across the micrometer- to nanometer-scale
range,10−12 this method requires high voltage (kV range) and
shows poor cost–yield efficiency because essentially a single
fiber emerges from the end of a nozzle carrying a polymeric solution.
In the past few years, a method called pressurized gyration has been
developed to form polymer fibers from the nanometer- to the micrometer-scale
range. It consists of simultaneous centrifugal spinning and solution
blowing and offers mass-production capabilities compared with electrospinning.13,14 Also, the diameter of fibers can be changed by varying the concentration
of the polymeric solution, rotating speed of the vessel, and the pressure
of the gas added into the vessel.

Graphene, a two-dimensional
monolayer of sp2-bonded
carbon atoms, has attracted a great deal of attention since its discovery
in 200415 because of its large specific
surface area,16 extraordinarily high electrical
and thermal conductivities, excellent mechanical properties,17 and potentially low manufacturing cost.18 Although there exists a large body of information
on graphene and its composites,19 there
is a dearth of published information on graphene nanofibers, which
can potentially be used as a substitute for CNFs in many applications.
The reason for this could be the high cost and the difficulty in processing
at high temperatures, which results in detrimental changes to the
microstructure and properties.

Spark plasma sintering (SPS)
is an advanced technique that utilizes
simultaneous application of uniaxial pressure and pulsed direct electrical
current (pulsed DC) to densify powder compacts.20−25 The rapid heating rates involved minimizes damage/decomposition
of graphene nanoplatelets (GNPs) by minimizing the sintering times24 and reduces the growth of nanocrystallites when
synthesizing the GNPs from the amorphous phase. However, to date,
no research work has reported on the effects of SPS processing on
the microstructure of CNFs, which makes this research topic timely
and interesting.

In the present study, PAN-based CNFs containing
various concentrations
of GNPs were synthesized by pressurized gyration, and subsequent heat
treatments were performed using pressure-less SPS. This study focused
on the influence of the additive concentration of GNPs as well as
the forming parameters on the microstructure and properties of the
CNFs. The morphologies and microstructures of the CNFs were studied
in detail using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission
electron microscopy (TEM). GNPs in CNFs were also characterized using
Raman spectroscopy to understand the structural changes that took
place during the high-temperature treatments.

2 Experimental
Section
2.1 Materials
PAN (average molecular
weight 150 000; density 1.184 g/mL at 20 °C) and N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) were purchased
from Sigma Aldrich (St. Louis, MO) and used as received without further
purification. The GNPs (XGNP-C750 grade) used in this study were produced
by XG Science, USA, with an average thickness of ∼2 nm, diameter
of 1–2 μm, average surface area of ∼750 m2 g–1, and bulk density of ∼0.2 g
cm–3. A TEM micrograph of GNPs is shown in Figure 1. PX35 Continuous
Tow carbon fiber was purchased from ZOLTEK (St. Charles, Missouri)
and is a 50K filament fiber manufactured from a PAN precursor.

Figure 1 Typical TEM
micrograph of GNPs. Specimen preparation involved ultrasonic
dispersion before imaging. The as-received specification for the GNPs
was 1–2 μm.

2.2 Preparation of CNFs
2.2.1 Pressurized
Gyration
The gyration
solutions were prepared by dispersing an appropriate amount of GNPs
(0, 0.2, 1.0, 3.0, and 8.0 wt %) in the PAN solution (10 wt % PAN
in DMF). The solution was sonicated for 1 h in an ice-water bath to
homogeneously disperse the GNPs. A schematic of the pressurized gyration
equipment is shown in Figure 2. A cylindrical aluminum vessel, with a defined number of
orifices (20) on the wall, forms micro to nanofibers by ejecting the
polymer solution as the vessel is rotated at a high speed using a
DC motor. An inlet pipe supplying N2 gas was connected
from the top of the vessel to induce pressure in the rotating vessel.
During gyration, the working pressure was varied from 1 to 3 ×
105 Pa by controlling the pressure of the inlet N2 gas into the vessel, and the rotational speed was varied from 10 000
to 36 000 rpm using a bi-directional regulator. The as-spun
PAN/GNP precursor nanofibers were collected randomly as an overlaid
mat on an aluminum foil placed on the inner wall of the collector.
The compositions and processing parameters of the different samples
are compiled and shown in Table 1.

a The concentration of GNP in the
solution was calculated by the weight of GNP divided by the total
weight of GNP and PAN solution. The concentration of GNP in the as-spun
fiber was calculated by the weight and density of GNP and PAN. The
weight percentage value of GNP in solution has been used consistently
as the GNP concentration in the following text for consistency.

2.2.2 Carbonization
and SPS Processing
The as-spun PAN/GNP nanofibers were peeled
off from the aluminum
foil and placed in a horizontal tube furnace for heat treatment. Before
carbonization, there was a stabilization process on the as-spun samples,
which took place at 290 °C for 30 min. Then the samples were
heated again from 290 °C with a heating rate of 2 °C/min
and maintained for 1 h at 900 °C before further heating at a
heating rate of 2 °C/min. Subsequently, the samples were maintained
for 1 h at the final temperature under an argon gas flow (60 mL/min)
for carbonization. The products were cooled to 25 °C in an argon
atmosphere at a cooling rate set at 2 °C/min. This treatment
was tailored to generate carbon nanofibers containing graphene.

The carbonized samples were put into a 20 mm graphite crucible and
then sintered in vacuum (1–3 Pa) in an SPS furnace. A heating
rate of 200 °C/min was used, and the final temperature was 2000
°C, with a dwell time of 10 min. The applied DC in the SPS was
1000–1500 A, with a pulse duration of 12 ms applied at an interval
of 2 ms. The CNF samples after carbonization and SPS processing are
referred to in this work as pyrolyzed and after-SPS CNFs, respectively.

2.3 Characterization
2.3.1 Average
Fiber Size and Size Distribution
To measure the diameters
of the as-spun PAN fibers and CNFs, an
image analyzer (Image-Pro Express, Media Cybernetics Co., US) was
used. At least five SEM images were used for each sample. One hundred
fibers were selected at random to calculate the average fiber diameter
and distribution.

2.3.2 Thermogravimetric Analysis
(TGA)
TGA of fibers with and without GNPs was carried out
on a universal
V4.5A TA instrument at a heating rate of 3 °C/min to 1000 °C
in a nitrogen atmosphere.

2.3.3 Morphology and Crystallization
The CNFs prepared before and after SPS were repeatedly washed using
deionized water and dried in an oven. A field-emission scanning electron
microscope (Hitachi S-3400N) was used to examine the morphologies
of the prepared CNFs. The phase identification of the CNF samples
was performed using a Renishaw-2000 laser Raman spectroscopy system
with a He–Ne laser excited at 514 nm. The samples were also
analyzed using TEM (JEOL 2000) at 200 keV.

2.3.4 Electrical
Conductivity Measurements
Electrical conductivity measurements
of the as-spun, pyrolyzed, and
after-SPS fibers were carried out using a two-point multimeter. Fibrous
mats of known weight and length were placed on a glass slide, and
the ends of the fibers were soldered with silver paste to enable electrical
contact. The cross-sectional area of the fibrous mats was calculated
from the SEM images of the fracture surface of the CNF/PVA composites.
Repeated measurements were carried out to determine the average electrical
conductivity of each sample.

2.3.5 Mechanical
Property Tests
The mechanical
properties of the CNFs were evaluated using Raman spectroscopy after
four-point bend testing of the samples. Initially, the CNF mats were
placed on a poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) beam and covered with
a thin layer of poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA). The beam was then inserted
into a four-point bending rig and deformed under various levels of
strain. Subsequently, the samples were placed on a Raman microscope
stage, and the surface strain was measured after three accumulations.
It was assumed that the strain in the PVA resin was the same as in
the PMMA substrate.

3 Results
and Discussion
3.1 Fiber Diameter Distributions
Figure 3 illustrates
the
statistical distributions of the diameter of the PAN-based fiber samples
with 0, 1.0, and 8.0 wt % of GNPs prepared under different processing
conditions, categorized as follows: as-spun, pyrolyzed, and after-SPS
samples. With regard to the influence of the GNP concentration, it
can be seen that the difference in the mean diameter becomes wide
in totality, especially for the as-spun samples, even though it appears
to be narrower at first and then wider, when increasing the concentration
of GNPs from 0 to 1.0 wt % and then to 8.0 wt %. This could be due
to differences in the viscosity of the feed stock solution and the
uniformity of the GNP distribution in the PAN solution. The GNPs dispersed
well in the solutions when the concentration was low (1.0 wt %); thus,
the differences in the diameter of these samples are narrower than
the others. On increasing the content of GNPs, the solution became
denser and some agglomeration of GNPs took place, thus worsening the
dispersion. As a result, the diameter difference became larger again
as the concentration of GNPs increased to 8.0 wt %.

Figure 3 Diameter distributions
for PAN-based fibers with various GNP concentrations
of (a) 0, (b) 1.0, and (c) 8.0 wt % and under different conditions
(as-spun, pyrolyzed, and after-SPS). n denotes the
number of samples analyzed.

It can also be seen in Figure 3 that the largest statistical variation in the diameter
for a particular GNP content is for the as-spun samples. After carbonization,
the statistical difference in the diameter of the fibers became narrower,
especially in the samples with GNPs of 1.0 and 8.0 wt % (Figure 3b,c). Furthermore,
after SPS, the statistical difference in the diameter of the pyrolyzed
samples further decreased, especially in the samples with 0 and 1.0
wt % GNPs (Figure 3a,b). The narrow diameter distribution indicates the uniformity in
pyrolyzed and SPS samples, which is mainly attributed to the solvent
and residue evaporation. Generally, a decrease in this trend is observed
for fiber diameter of the as-spun, pyrolyzed, and after-SPS samples.
For example, the average diameter of the pure PAN fibers changed from
3.21 to 2.44 μm from as-spun to pyrolyzed conditions. This change
can be observed more clearly and intuitively from Figure 4.

Figure 4 Average fiber diameter
of as-spun, pyrolyzed, and after-SPS samples
with different concentrations of GNPs.

Figure 4 shows
the
difference in the fiber diameter between the as-spun, pyrolyzed, and
after-SPS samples. It can be clearly seen that the average diameter
of the PAN-based fibers decreased gradually after the carbonization
and SPS processes, regardless of the GNP concentration. The average
diameter of the fibers without GNPs decreased from 3.21 to 2.44 μm
after the carbonization process at 900 °C, and then to 1.54 μm
after SPS treatment at 2000 °C. Similarly, for the samples with
3.0 wt % GNPs, the average fiber diameter decreased from 2.79 to 2.12 μm
after the carbonization process and then decreased to 1.38 μm
after SPS treatment at 2000 °C. This result can be explained
by the fact that shrinkage took place in the fibers during the high-temperature
heat treatments because of decomposition reactions. Moreover, one
can observe in Figure 4 that on increasing the concentration of GNPs, the average fiber
diameter decreased first and then increased, irrespective of the processing
conditions of the fiber. This can be the result of the uniformity
of additive as well as the viscosity of the solutions. Consequently,
the average diameter of the as-spun, pyrolyzed, and after-SPS samples
resulted in finer fiber diameters of 1.05, 0.73, and 0.71 μm,
respectively, at a GNP concentration of ∼1.0 wt %.

The
rotational speed and the working pressure of gyration were
varied to study the effect on the average diameter of the fibers. Figure 5 shows a plot of
the fiber diameter against rotational speed under different working
pressures. A substantial reduction in the average fiber diameter was
observed by increasing the rotational speed from 10 000 to
24 000 rpm at a working pressure of ≤2 × 105 Pa. Thus, for the samples fabricated at 1 × 105 Pa, increasing the rotational speed from 10 000 to 24 000
rpm reduced the fiber diameter from ∼3.6 to ∼2.6 μm.
Similarly, for the samples fabricated at 2 × 105 Pa,
the fiber diameter decreased from ∼2.15 to ∼1.25 μm.
However, with further increase in the rotational speed from 24 000
to 36 000 rpm, there was no significant further decrease, but
actually a slight increase in the diameter of the fibers compared
with the former. In comparison to the previous results for virgin
polymer,13 there is a slight deviation
of trend, but the overall tendency of diameter reduction with (initial)
increase in the rotation speed is similar. As for the samples produced
with a higher working pressure of 3 × 105 Pa, the
impact of rotational speed on diameter is not significant for the
whole range of rotational speeds investigated (10 000–36 000
rpm).

speeds and various working pressures.

3.2 Thermogravimetry of CNFs
Figure 6 displays the TGA
curves and the differential TGA (DTGA) curves of the pure PAN fiber
and PAN–GNP fiber with 8.0 wt % of GNPs, carried out in a nitrogen
atmosphere. As observed from the TGA curve, there is a sharp decrease
in weight in the temperature range of 80–100 °C because
of loss of solvent and/or adsorbed water molecules in the fibers.
Moreover, a large amount of weight loss in PAN–GNP fibers was
observed at ∼250 °C, and the weight change of the sample
in the temperature range of 270–300 °C was 16.1%, which
was mainly due to the decomposition of the fibers.26

wt %) nanofibers in a nitrogen atmosphere.

3.3 Morphologies of PAN-Based Fibers
The SEM micrographs of the as-spun, pyrolyzed, and after-SPS PAN-based
fibers with different concentrations of GNPs are shown in Figure 7. It can be seen
that the as-spun PAN fibers are distributed randomly and the difference
between their diameters is wide, as can be seen in Figure 3. Moreover, there are some
beads within the fibers which were probably created by the mismatch
of viscosity and processing parameters such as rotational speed and
working pressures.

Figure 7 SEM micrographs of PAN-based fibers made with various
concentrations
of GNPs (a) 0, (b) 1.0, and (c) 8.0 wt % and under different conditions
(as-spun, pyrolyzed, and after-SPS).

As for pyrolyzed PAN-based CNFs, there are differences in
the morphologies
of the surfaces of fibers with different concentrations of GNPs. It
can be observed in Figure 7 that the surface of the fibers is smooth when the concentration
of GNPs is 0 wt % or low (0.2 wt %). However, on increasing the GNP
concentration from 0 to 8.0 wt %, the surface of the CNF samples becomes
increasingly rougher. Furthermore, there are many fine particles with
a size on the order of hundreds of nanometers on the surface of the
fibers when the concentration of GNPs was increased to 1.0 wt % (Figure 7b). These particles
are GNPs, which is verified and discussed in detail in section 3.4. On increasing
the GNP concentration (to 8.0 wt %), the agglomeration of GNPs takes
place and the surface of CNFs becomes rougher. Meanwhile, the diameter
of the CNFs decreased initially and then increased (Figure 4).

With regard to the
after-SPS CNFs, it can be seen in Figure 7 that the SPS processing resulted
in a rougher surface of the pure PAN-based fibers compared with those
of pyrolyzed CNFs. The reason for this is that the graphitization
takes place at a high temperature of 2000 °C during SPS.26 The amorphous structure of carbon transformed
into graphite partly by heat treatment as well as by thermal decomposition
at higher temperatures, which can be verified by the diffraction patterns
of TEM (section 3.4.2). Meanwhile, the diameter of the pure PAN-based CNFs decreased,
which is shown quantitatively in Figure 4. Furthermore, it can be seen in Figure 7 that the morphologies
of the after-SPS CNFs with GNPs are significantly different compared
with those of the pyrolyzed samples. This can be attributed to the
relatively high temperature of the SPS process. This transformation
of structure resulted in some movement of the nanoparticles on the
surface of the fibers, and the surface appears different to that before
the SPS treatment. Concerning the samples with a high concentration
of 8.0 wt % of GNPs, it can be seen in Figure 7c that the aggregation of graphene still
existed after SPS processing. Moreover, the content of graphene as
well as the degree of graphitization could be improved by the heat
treatment at such a high temperature.

3.4 Analysis
of Crystallite Structure of CNFs
3.4.1 Raman
Analysis on CNFs before and after
SPS
Figure 8 illustrates the Raman spectra of the pyrolyzed and after-SPS CNFs
with different concentrations of GNPs. Raman spectroscopy was performed
at different locations on each sample to improve the sampling. It
is evident that there are two main peaks (D- and G-bands) at about
1350 and 1583 cm–1 which are attributed to the existence
of a disordered structure and stretching of the C–C bond, respectively,27 regardless of the GNP concentration and forming
conditions. However, the differences in the Raman spectra are clearly
due to the existence (or not) of the band around 2680 cm–1, which is called the 2D band, and the intensity ratio between the
D- and G-bands. First, in the case of pyrolyzed samples, there is
no 2D-band in the pure PAN-based CNF sample (Figure 8a), whereas the 2D-band appeared in the spectra
of the pyrolyzed samples that contained GNPs (Figure 8b,c). Combined with the G-band, the 2D-band
is a Raman signature of graphitic sp2 materials, which
indicates that pyrolyzed pure CNFs have a turbostratic structure.
Moreover, on increasing the concentration of GNPs from 1.0 to 8.0
wt %, the 2D-band was detected more prominently and its intensity
increased gradually. This is a result of the increase in the GNP concentration
which is able to transform into nano-crystalline graphite. Similarly,
for CNFs containing GNPs, it can be seen (Figure 8b,c) that the intensity of the 2D-band increased
after SPS treatment in the Raman spectra compared to that of pyrolyzed
samples. Furthermore, another aspect of SPS treatment of the samples
is the change in the intensity ratio of D- to G-bands in the Raman
spectra. The calculated results of the intensity ratio of D- to G-bands
(ID/IG), intensity
ratio of 2D- to G-bands (I2D/IG), and full-width at half maximum (FWHM) of G-band of
the different CNFs are compiled in Table 2.

Generally, the higher the D-band intensity, the larger the number
of defects, and from the double resonance theory, crystal defects
scatter the excited electrons resulting in the wave vector condition,
making the intensity of the D-band defect-dependent.28,29 A narrow G-band is an indication of higher structural ordering and
crystallinity.29 Therefore, the intensity
ratio of the D- and G-bands and the shape of these bands can be used
to determine the structural ordering in the CNFs. It is clearly seen
from Table 2 that increasing
the GNP concentration decreased the ID/IG ratio of the pyrolyzed samples, indicating
greater graphitization in the samples. It is also true for the SPS-treated
samples at 2000 °C.

Figure 9 shows the
dependence of GNP concentration and processing conditions on the FWHMG, ID/IG, and I2D/IG ratios. The ratio of ID/IG increased after SPS for all of the samples (different
concentration of GNPs from 0 to 8.0 wt %). The higher temperature
produced crystallization and ordering of the carbon in the fibers.
Tuinstra and Koenig30 reported the ID/IG ratio to be
inversely proportional to the crystallite size, which was later confirmed
by Knight and White.31 The above results
suggest that during the SPS heat treatment at 2000 °C, nanocrystals
of graphene-nanoplatelets evolved from the amorphous structure. In
fact, owing to the dependence of the ID/IG ratio on the excitation wavelength,
Tuinstra and Koenig’s law becomes approximate and cannot be
applied for a crystallite size below ∼10 nm.32 The smaller the volume of the GNPs, the larger the ID/IG ratio. For
example, ID/IG of single-layer graphene is larger than that of double-layer and
triple-layer graphene. Nevertheless, nanocrystals would grow resulting
in a crystallite size larger than 10 nm in the SPS processing at a
higher temperature. The effect of GNP content caused the ratio of ID/IG to drop when
increasing the concentration of GNPs (even though the value for the
sample with 2 wt % GNPs deviated to some extent). This deviation may
have been caused by the inhomogeneity of GNP dispersion arising from
the low concentration. On increasing the GNPs, the agglomeration of
GNPs is stronger and the ratio of ID/IG decreased.

Figure 9 Ratios of ID/IG (a), I2D/IG (b), and FWHMG (c) of
CNF samples with various
concentrations of GNPs made under different conditions (pyrolyzed
and after-SPS).

Figure 9b shows
that the value of the I2D/IG ratio increased after SPS treatment because after SPS
the degree of graphitization of CNF samples is higher than that of
the original samples (pyrolyzed). This ratio is widely used to determine
the number of graphene layers in the structures.33 Actually, the I2D/IG ratio of single-layer graphene is larger than that of
multi-layer graphene. Similarly, there is an enhancement of I2D/IG ratio for
the pyrolyzed CNFs because the GNPs added increased from 0 to 8.0
wt %. The reason for this can be the same as that for ID/IG, resulting from the agglomeration
and growth of the GNPs, which can be verified by the SEM micrographs
in Figure 7.

Figure 9c shows
that the FWHMG of after-SPS CNFs is higher than that of
pyrolyzed samples for up to ∼8.0 wt % of GNPs. This can be
due to the fact that the higher degree of graphitization after the
high-temperature SPS processing produced a high intensity of G-band
in the Raman spectra.

3.4.2 TEM Analysis on CNFs
with GNPs
Figure 10 illustrates
the key features of the microstructure of the CNFs determined from
TEM images and diffraction patterns with different concentrations
of GNPs (0 and 8.0 wt %) after carbonization as well as SPS treatments.
It can be seen that graphene exists inside of the CNFs and can be
more easily discerned at the edges of the fibers (Figure 10c). The selected area diffraction
shows the crystallinity of the CNFs. From the diffraction patterns,
the ordered graphitic layers present in the CNFs after carbonization
treatment can be clearly seen. The diffraction planes in the fibers
are identified as [002], [100], and [004] from the inner circle to
the outer circle, respectively.34 Even
though there is no graphene in the pure PAN-based fibers, diffraction
patterns emerge after SPS at 2000 °C (Figure 10d), which indicates that nanocrystallites
of graphite are formed at high temperatures. These results are consistent
with the Raman results (section 3.4.1).

CNFs from circled locations

8.0 wt % of GNPs; and (c,f) after-SPS CNFs with 8.0 wt % of GNPs.

3.5 Electrical
Properties of CNFs
Figure 11 shows that the
electrical conductivity of CNFs made under different conditions is
dependent on the concentration of GNPs. Increasing the GNP concentrations
caused the conductivity of the CNFs to increase gradually, no matter
how they were prepared (Figure 11a). Figure 11b shows a typical SEM image of the fracture surface after
bending tests which was used for determining the cross-sectional area
of CNFs. The value of electrical conductivity of the as-spun PAN-based
fibers increased from ∼4 to ∼46 × 103 S/m when increasing the GNP loading from 0 to 8.0 wt %. Similarly,
for pyrolyzed CNFs, the value increased from ∼36 to ∼193
× 103 S/m as the concentration of GNPs increased from
0 to 8.0 wt %. Most strikingly, for a similar increase in GNPs, the
increase in the electrical conductivity of the CNFs after SPS at 2000
°C was ∼179 to ∼272 × 103 S/m.
The increase in the electrical conductivity of the pyrolyzed and SPS
samples indicates that the degree of graphitization is higher in these
samples than that of as-spun PAN fibers. This validates our Raman
and TEM data showing nanocrystallites of graphites formed at higher
temperature, which act as effective electron carriers. Figure 11c demonstrates this very clearly,
where an LED lights up when connected in close-circuit using pyrolyzed
samples, even before SPS. Thus, these samples have the potential to
make conductivity bridges for electrical engineering applications.

3.6 Mechanical
Properties of CNFs
The
presence of 2D-band in the Raman spectra of the samples provides an
opportunity to study the mechanical properties of the CNFs produced
in this work because this band position in the spectra is very sensitive
to deformation. Figure 12 shows the deformation-induced shifts in the 2D-band during
four-point bend tests of the CNF composites (pyrolyzed CNFs). It can
be seen that the band position of the CNFs decreased with tensile
deformation; the higher the deformation, the higher the peak shift.
The rate of Raman shift with respect to strain was obtained by fitting
the data linearly in the strain range measured. This value was found
to be −0.037 cm–1. It was reported that the
rate of 2D Raman shift can be related to the modulus of the CNFs.35 There exists a universal calibration of −0.05
cm–1/GPa for the stress-induced shifts of the 2D-bands
of CNFs pyrolyzed at 1000 °C. This calibration has been extensively
used to obtain the modulus of graphene and carbon nanotubes.36 Under this assumption, the calibration is also
valid for the CNFs in our work, and the modulus of the CNFs is 74
GPa. This value is in agreement with those reported in the literature
for cellulose-based carbon fibers37 but
is substantially higher than that reported for carbon fibers derived
from micron-sized cellulose fibers, which is 40 GPa.38

versus the
strain of CNFs made in this work obtained using four-point bend testing
and Raman spectroscopy.

4 Conclusions
Carbon nanofibers were
obtained by using pressurized gyration and
high-temperature processing. The fiber diameter and distribution are
controlled by the key forming parameters of rotating speed, working
pressure, and loading concentration of the GNPs. The pyrolysis and
the spark plasma temperature influenced the microstructures of the
carbon nanofibers. A heat-treatment temperature of 2000 °C in
SPS produced nanofibers with a high degree of graphitization with
properties superior to those of commercial carbon fibers. These nanofibers
are useful in advanced engineering applications.
