A simple, in situ, and one-pot hydrothermal strategy
was applied for the successful manufacturing of heterostructured 2D/2D
BiOCl/g-C3N4 photocatalysts, and outstanding
photodegradation of Rhodamine B in the condition of visible-light
irradiation over the composites emerged. The investigation of various
BiOCl/g-C3N4 ratios influencing the activity
implied that the optimized B2C1 (mole ratio of BiOCl/g-C3N4 with 2:1) exhibited the higher degradation efficiency
than that of the rest of the composites, even higher than that of
pure BiOCl and pure g-C3N4, which yielded over
90% in the initial 30 min and reached almost 100% during the whole
70 min irradiation process. Kinds of characterizations demonstrated
that the enhancement of photodegradation performance was caused by
the intimate contact between BiOCl and g-C3N4 to form the heterostructure, which could benefit the generation
of abundant visible-light photoinduced carriers and help enhance their
separation and then promote their transportation to the surface.

Introduction
Environmental pollution and energy crises are two main global issues
that have been the hot topics in the past decades.1 For the former, water pollution influences the drinking
water safety of humans directly, and among the abundant pollutants,
dyes such as Rhodamine B (RhB) deserve to be focused on due to its
massive emission from industries and daily use, difficult degradation,
and toxicity.2 Due to these harmful properties,
kinds of methods were applied for the innocent treatment of RhB, including
chemical degradation, physical and chemical adsorption, photocatalysis,
or the combinations of these methods.3−6 Among these treatments,
photocatalysis is a rising star owing to the nature of the infinite
driving force from solar energy and the green treating processes.

Until now, plentiful photocatalysts have been explored and synthesized
containing TiO2, Bi-based composites, Cd-based materials,
MOFs, TaON, etc.7−15 Unfortunately, problems such
as low solar light usage and fast carrier-binding need to be settled
all the time. Recently, 2D materials like g-C3N4, graphene, C3N, MoS2, and BiOCl were developed
due to their unique properties, such as large surface areas and adjustable
layers.16−23 Two-dimensional
materials with few layers benefit the separation and transport of
photoinduced carriers, thus enhancing photocatalytic performance.24 Among these 2D materials, the BiOCl nanosheet
attracts more attention owing to its stability, indirect band gap,
and nontoxicity.25 Numerous research studies
confirmed the photocatalytic efficiency of BiOCl counting on its morphology
and size. Hence, many strategies are dedicated to regulating the thickness
of 2D materials. The pH value in the precursor was reported to influence
the thickness of 2D BiOCl, and the pH value displayed a positive influence
on the thickness in which BiOCl prepared in the condition of pH =
5 exhibited the highest activity for RhB photodegradation.24 The addition of metal ions such as Fe3+, Co2+, and Na+ was also confirmed to affect
the thickness of 2D BiOCl.26 However, the
wide band gap of BiOCl limits its utilization of sunlight. These methods
are worth developing to overcome this disadvantage.

Constructing
the heterostructure between BiOCl and other photocatalysts is a proven
effective strategy, which can not only enlarge the use of sunlight
but also promote the segregation of photoinduced charges further.27,28 Especially, building 2D/2D heterostructures is a promising way to
generate large contact areas and accelerate charge transfer. The construction
of 2D BiOCl/Bi12O17Cl2 nanojunctions
was reported, and the results confirmed that the composites displayed
higher NO removal efficiency than that of pure materials.29 The heterostructured 2D/2D BiOCl/K+Ca2Nb3O10– nanosheets
were constructed, and they improved the photodegradation of tetracycline
hydrochloride.30 Among the vast 2D materials,
g-C3N4 is focused on due to its dramatic properties
such as easy preparation, metal-free composition, satisfied stability,
and visible light response. g-C3N4 has been
utilized for kinds of visible-light photocatalytic tests, such as
photodegradation, water splitting, CO2 reduction, etc.1,31,32 Heterostructured BiOCl/g-C3N4 composites have been widely reported for photodegradation
application. Liu et al. prepared 2D BiOCl/g-C3N4 layered composites for photodegradation of methyl orange, and the
degradation efficiency reached 84.28% after 180 min of visible-light
illumination.33 The preparation method
could not make full use of BiOCl or g-C3N4;
thus, the photoactivity could be enhanced further by improving the
synthesis routes. Song et al. synthesized BiOCl/g-C3N4 composites for RhB photodegradation via two different preparation
methods, including NH4Cl-templated hydrothermal and sonication-assisted
deposition–precipitation routes, and they all exhibited satisfied
photodegradation efficiency.34,35 The microwave-assisted
method was also applied for the preparation of BiOCl/g-C3N4 composites, and the excellent nizatidine photodegradation
performance was achieved.36 However, the
contact area between BiOCl and g-C3N4 could
be enlarged by adjusting the shape of BiOCl to be uniform to promote
the transportation of carriers, thus further enhancing the photocatalytic
performance. Therefore, it is necessary to explore a new strategy
for the construction of 2D BiOCl/g-C3N4 composites
with large contact areas.

Herein, in this work, a new simple
one-pot hydrothermal method was developed for the preparation of 2D/2D
heterostructured BiOCl/g-C3N4 with large contact
areas successfully, and they were investigated by photodegradation
of RhB in the condition of visible light irradiation. The influence
of various ratios of BiOCl to g-C3N4 on the
photocatalytic efficiency was investigated, and various characterizations
such as XRD, SEM, TEM, XPS, UV–vis, PL, etc. were adopted to
explain the relationship between the structure and activity. The mechanism
of photodegradation of RhB over 2D/2D heterostructured BiOCl/g-C3N4 was proposed. This work aims to provide a strategy
for the construction of two separate 2D materials to form a heterostructure
with a large contact area in a simple and economic way, which can
still exhibit the enhanced photocatalytic performance.

Results and Discussion
Physicochemical Structure and Morphology Observation
XRD patterns were performed to confirm the crystal forms of the
sole BiOCl, sole g-C3N4, and BiOCl/g-C3N4 composites, displayed in Figure 1a. The Bi sample displayed the typical tetragonal
BiOCl crystal structure (JCPDS no. 06-0249). However, the intensities
of the peaks at 32.5° and 33.4° were attributed to the standard
card, which corresponded to the (110) and (102) crystal faces, respectively.
The results indicated that the main exposed face was (110), which
was confirmed to be the active face for photocatalysis.37 The same phenomenon was observed for BiOCl-containing
samples. Sole g-C3N4 displayed two obvious diffraction
peaks at 12.8° and 27.1°, ascribed to the (100) and (002)
crystal faces of typical g-C3N4. The former
peak was caused by the in-plane repeated tri-s-triazine
moieties, while the latter originated from the stacked, conjugated
aromatic system.38 The distinct peaks that
appeared in pure BiOCl and g-C3N4 confirmed
their high crystallinity. For all BiOCl/g-C3N4 composites, two series peaks assigned to two pure materials were
both observed, indicating the presence of BiOCl and g-C3N4 in the composites and both structures being retained.
Moreover, the peak intensity corresponding to g-C3N4 intensified gradually with the increase of the g-C3N4/BiOCl mole ratio, showing that g-C3N4 was mostly adopted in the composites. No additional peaks
were observed in the composites, displaying the pure formation of
the composites.

Figure 1 (a) XRD patterns and (b) FT-IR of sole BiOCl, sole g-C3N4, and BiOCl/g-C3N4 composites.

The chemical structures on the surface of the
samples were also explored via FT-IR techniques, as shown in Figure 1b. Typically, the
wide peaks from 3000 to 3400 cm–1 belonged to the
N–H band. Peaks at 1315 and 1240 cm–1 belonged
to the typical extending modes of CN heterocycles.39 Moreover, the peak ascribed to the typical vibration of
triazine rings also appeared at 810 cm–1.40 Additionally, the peak that appeared at 1010
cm–1 was caused by the Bi–O vibration. In
the overview of all samples, it could be seen that the intensities
of the peaks ascribed to BiOCl or g-C3N4 increased
along with the ratio increase of the corresponding component in the
composites. It was further explained that the BiOCl/g-C3N4 composites were constructed successfully.

The
N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms over Bi, CN,
and B2C1 samples were applied to investigate the BET surface area,
as shown in Figure S1. Three samples all
exhibited N2 isotherms of type IV with hysteresis loops
of type H3,41 confirming the formation
of a mesoporous structure. The BET surface areas of sole BiOCl, sole
g-C3N4, and the heterostructured BiOCl/g-C3N4 were 14.6, 112.3, and 47.1 m2/g,
respectively. Compared to two pure samples, BiOCl/g-C3N4 displayed a decreased surface area value, which was ascribed
to the introduction of BiOCl with a relatively low BET surface area.
This phenomenon could also confirm the generation of the heterostructure
between BiOCl and g-C3N4.

SEM images were
conducted to observe all morphologies, displayed in Figure 2. The sole g-C3N4 displayed the aggregated rolled flake morphology, while pure
BiOCl showed the typical irregular lamellar morphology. The surface
of pure BiOCl was extremely smooth, confirming its purity after preparation.
The size of pure BiOCl ranged from approximately 200 to 1100 nm in
width and approximately 70 nm in thickness. For all BiOCl/g-C3N4 composites, two typical morphologies corresponding
to two pure materials were observed, and the number of particles assigned
to g-C3N4 increased with the increasing of g-C3N4/BiOCl mole ratio. Additionally, the EDS result
of the selected B2C1 sample confirmed the existence of Bi, O, Cl,
C, and N elements in the composites, displayed in Figure S2, indicating the successful introduction of Bi, O,
Cl, C, and N elements, which was in accordance with XRD analysis.

Figure 2 SEM images of sole BiOCl, sole g-C3N4, and BiOCl/g-C3N4 composites.

HR-TEM characterization was adopted to observe more detailed morphologies
of sole BiOCl, sole g-C3N4, and BiOCl/g-C3N4 composites, displayed in Figure 3. The irregular size and smooth surface of
the pure BiOCl was further confirmed from TEM images. The distinct
periodic lattice spacing was observed from HR-TEM, which exhibited
the interplanar distance of 0.275 nm, corresponding to the (110) crystal
plane. From the selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) images,
the single-crystal diffraction spot appeared, which showed the two
crystal planes of (110) and (200). For the pure g-C3N4 sample, the unfolded flake morphology was observed. The obvious
surface of g-C3N4 could be seen from HR-TEM,
and one polycrystal diffraction ring appeared in SAED images, which
was ascribed to the (002) plane of g-C3N4. For
the B2C1 composite, the BiOCl particles emerged mainly in TEM images,
and the flake morphology of g-C3N4 could also
be observed. The similar shape in the composites to the separate pure
materials indicated that the combination between g-C3N4 and BiOCl could not alter their original morphologies. In
HR-TEM images, g-C3N4 was capped over BiOCl
particles, indicating the impinged contact between BiOCl and g-C3N4. This phenomenon confirmed the generation of
the face-to-face heterostructure of BiOCl and g-C3N4, which could improve the transfer and separation of the photoinduced
carriers, thus enhancing the photocatalytic performance. Moreover,
the single-crystal diffraction spot and one polycrystal diffraction
ring both appeared in the mixture, explaining the existence of BiOCl
and g-C3N4.

Figure 3 TEM, HR-TEM, and SAED images of sole BiOCl, sole g-C3N4, and B2C1 composites.

SEM mapping of the B2C1 composite
was applied to investigate the dispersion of BiOCl and g-C3N4 in the mixture, displayed in Figure S3. The phenomenon displayed the homogeneous distribution of
Bi, O, Cl, C, and N elements in the B2C1 sample, indicating a high
dispersion of g-C3N4 and BiOCl in the composite.

Band Structure Analysis
Since the photocatalytic performance
was determined by the band structure of the photocatalyst, it is necessary
to explore the band structure information of the component in the
BiOCl/g-C3N4 mixtures. The valence band X-ray
photoelectron spectroscopy (VB-XPS) was applied to explore the valence
band positions (EVB) of pure BiOCl and
pure g-C3N4, displayed in Figure 4a. The obtained values of BiOCl and g-C3N4 were 1.58 and 1.93 eV, respectively. The band
gap (Eg) was obtained from the conversion
of UV–vis DRS spectra. The conversion is based on the following
equation. 1  where h, v, and A is the Planck’s constant,
frequency of photons, and absorbance, respectively. The n value in the condition of n = 1 is the direct transition,
while n = 4 is the indirect transition. For both
BiOCl and g-C3N4, the values of n are both selected as 4.

profiles, and (d) illustrated band structures of sole BiOCl and sole
g-C3N4.

Hence, the Eg values of BiOCl and g-C3N4 were 2.82
and 2.33 eV, respectively, displayed in Figure 4b. Mott–Schottky measurements were
adopted to find out more information of the band structure, as shown
in Figure 4c. The positive
slope of the tangent of profiles over BiOCl and g-C3N4 indicated that they were both n-type semiconductors. The
flat band positions (Vfb where the unit
is V vs Ag/AgCl) could be obtained from the intersection between the
tangent and y = 0 plot, which were −0.20 and
−0.19 corresponding to BiOCl and g-C3N4. Based on the following formula, the unit of Vfb was converted from V vs Ag/AgCl to the normal hydrogen electrode
(NHE) potential.42 2  

After conversion, the Vfb values of BiOCl and g-C3N4 were −0.003 and 0.007 eV, respectively. Generally,
the position of Vfb was close to the value
of the Fermi level.43 Based on the known
value of EVB and Eg, the position of the conduction band (ECB) could be computed based on the following formula. 3  

The calculated ECB values of BiOCl and g-C3N4 were −1.24 and −0.40 eV, respectively. From
the above results, the band structures of sole BiOCl and sole g-C3N4 were obtained, illustrated in Figure 4d. Moreover, the Vfb values of BiOCl and g-C3N4 were
extremely close to each other, which benefited the construction of
the heterostructure between sole BiOCl and sole g-C3N4, confirming the analysis of TEM.

RhB Photodegradation Performance
Photodegradation of
RhB tests under visible-light illumination for all samples was shown
in Figure 5a. Among
all photocatalysts, pure g-C3N4 displayed the
lowest degradation efficiency, which reached only 65% after 70 min
of visible-light irradiation. Sole BiOCl exhibited higher performance
than that of sole g-C3N4 during the photodegradation
process, and it reached 89% degradation efficiency after 70 min of
irradiation. It could be seen that among all samples, the efficiency
increased initially and then declined along with the increase of BiOCl
to g-C3N4 ratios, and the B2C1 sample displayed
the highest photodegradation activity, which reached almost 100% degradation
efficiency after 70 min. Moreover, the efficiency of the B2C1 sample
yielded over 90% after just 30 min of visible-light irradiation. Additionally,
the blank test was conducted, and the results displayed that there
were almost no photodegradation activity in the absence of photocatalysts,
indicating that the self-degradation of RhB for the photocatalytic
activity could be excluded.

Figure 5 (a) Photocatalytic degradation of RhB and (b) linear fit
for the first-order kinetics model over sole BiOCl, sole g-C3N4, and BiOCl/g-C3N4 composites.

The degradation kinetics for all
samples was conducted, displayed in Figure 5b. The fitting results displayed that all
samples meet well the first-order kinetics model with the following
equation. 4  where C, C0, k, and t is the rest concentration of RhB in the reaction system, fresh concentration
of RhB, apparent rate constant, and irradiation time, respectively.
The variation trend of the obtained k values from
the fitting profiles was in accordance with the tendency of photodegradation
activity. Moreover, the k value of the optimum B2C1
sample was 2.4 and 4.9 times larger than that of sole BiOCl and sole
g-C3N4.

The catalytic reaction stability
of the catalyst is crucial for practical application. Therefore, the
photocatalytic stability over the B2C1 composite was performed via
four time-cycle degradation experiments, as shown in Figure S4. After four runs of the photocatalysis reaction,
the RhB degradation efficiency over the B2C1 sample after 30 min of
visible-light illumination decreased slightly from 90.36% in the first
run to 90.04% in the fourth run, indicating its satisfying photocatalytic
stability.

Enhanced Photodegradation Investigation
XPS characterization
was adopted to investigate the difference of surface valence states
of different elements between pure materials and the composites, aiming
to confirm the interaction between BiOCl and g-C3N4 and explore the enhancement on photodegradation, as shown
in Figure 6. Typically,
the optimum B2C1 sample was selected as the composite for comparison.
The survey spectra confirmed the existence of Bi, C, O, Cl, and N
elements on the surface, in accordance with EDS analysis. Displayed
in Figure 6b, two main
peaks were observed on the Bi-containing samples in which the peaks
at low binding energy (BE) were ascribed to Bi 4f7/2, while
the high BE peaks were assigned to Bi 4f5/2.44 Compared to pure BiOCl, the peaks in B2C1 shifted
to the negative BE value, explaining the interaction between two sole
materials. Nevertheless, the generation of the heterostructure could
not change the valence state of Bi, and the distance between two splitting
peaks remained approximately 5.3 eV indicating the existence of Bi3+.45 In the O 1s spectra, two peaks
appeared on both samples. The peaks at a low BE value were attributed
to the lattice oxygen, and the peaks at a high BE value were assigned
to the chemisorbed oxygen, such as O2–.46 The Cl 2p spectra displayed two obvious
peaks, which belonged to Cl 2p3/2 and Cl 2p1/2, corresponding to the low and high BE peaks, respectively.47 The same as Bi 4f spectra, the observed peak
shift on the composite was due to the formation of the heterostructure.
For the C 1s spectra, two maxima at approximately 283 and 287 eV appeared.
The former was caused by the surface-adsorbed external carbon or defect-containing
sp2 C elements from graphitic carbon, while the latter
was ascribed to the N—C≡N coordinate in the framework
of C3N4.48 The N
1s spectra could be fit into three maxima, which are located at approximately
397, 399, and 403 eV. The lowest BE peaks were attributed to the sp2 N involved in triazine rings, and the middle BE peaks were
assigned to the bridged N atoms in N–(C)349,50 or N bonded to H atoms.51 The highest
weak BE peaks were ascribed to π excitations.52 It is worth mentioning that the highest BE peak
in the B2C1 composite disappeared, indicating that BiOCl interacted
with g-C3N4 through the π-electron cloud
of CN heterocycles.52 Additionally, the
formation of the heterostructure was further confirmed by the fact
that the shifts were also observed in the C 1s and N 1s spectra. Combined
with photodegradation performance, it could be concluded that the
formation of the heterostructure could benefit the segregation and
transportation of photoinduced charges, consequently enhancing the
degradation efficiency.

The technique of UV–vis DRS was
adopted to explore the photoresponse at different wavelengths over
these samples, and PL characterization was applied to investigate
the segregation and transfer of charges, displayed in Figure 7a,b. Compared to pure BiOCl,
the adsorption edges of all composites had undergone an obvious redshift,
and when compared to sole g-C3N4, light absorptivity
of the composites was higher. The results indicated that the formation
of the heterostructure between two sole materials could promote the
light adsorption efficiency, thus causing more excitation of valence
electrons and then generating more active sites. The intensity of
PL spectra generally reflects the amounts of the recombined electrons
and holes, and a low intensity displays a suppressed recombination
rate.53 In the PL spectra, sole BiOCl and
sole g-C3N4 exhibited stronger PL emission than
that of the composites, indicating the fast binding of charges. The
facts also explained that the construction of BiOCl and g-C3N4 could suppress the recombination and promote the segregation
of charges. Among all composites, the B2C1 sample displayed the weakest
intensity, confirming its most efficient segregation of charges, thus
exhibiting the highest photodegradation performance.

Figure 7 (a) UV–vis DRS plots, (b) PL profiles, (c) EIS
spectra, and (d) PC potential plots of sole BiOCl, sole g-C3N4, and BiOCl/g-C3N4 composites.

The electrochemical
impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and photocurrent (PC) tests were applied
to further study the segregation efficiency of charges. In general,
the large radius of EIS curves explains the big carrier transportation
resistance, and the large value of the photocurrent under irradiation
implies the vast amount of photoinduced carriers.54,55 As
shown in Figure 7c,
the small radii were appeared in sole BiOCl and sole g-C3N4, and after the combination, the radii of the composites
were increased. Among all composites, the B2C1 sample displayed the
largest value of radius. The above results confirmed that the construction
of the heterostructure between BiOCl and g-C3N4 could weaken the charge transfer resistance, thus benefitting the
transfer of the generated carriers. From Figure 7d, the similar phenomenon was observed in
which sole BiOCl and sole g-C3N4 displayed a
weak visible light response and the composites showed relatively strong
intensity. Moreover, the B2C1 sample exhibited the most intense response
under visible-light illumination. The results confirmed that the photoinduced
carriers were generated in abundance, and the separation capacity
was enlarged through the formation of the heterostructure, which was
in accordance with PL results. Combined with photocatalytic performance,
it could be concluded that the formation between BiOCl and g-C3N4 could generate the abundant visible-light photoinduced
charges, enhance the segregation of these charges, and then promote
their transportation to the surface, thus leading to outstanding photodegradation
activity of RhB under visible-light illumination.

Photocatalysis Mechanism
Photodegradation of the RhB
mechanism in the condition of visible light illumination over the
BiOCl/g-C3N4 mixture was proposed, as displayed
in Figure 8. During
the first adsorption equilibrium process, the dye of RhB was initially
adsorbed on the surface of BiOCl; then, it could act as a photosensitizer
for photodegradation. Due to the small distance between HOMO and LUMO
orbitals of RhB, they could be excited to form RhB* under
visible-light illumination. Next, the photoexcited electrons in RhB
were transferred to the conduction band (CB) of BiOCl, which possessed
more positive potential.56 However, due
to the appropriate Eg of BiOCl and g-C3N4, they could be both excited under visible-light
illumination. Hence, the jammed electrons on the CB of BiOCl were
transferred to the more positive CB of g-C3N4; then, the formation of the heterostructure between BiOCl and g-C3N4 could promote this transportation. On account
of the same excitation of g-C3N4 in the condition
of visible-light illumination, the electrons on the CB crowded to
a higher degree.
Therefore, the electrons on the CB of g-C3N4 were transferred to the surface of the composite, and they were
able to reduce the adsorbed oxygen to form O2–, caused by the CB potential of g-C3N4 being
more negative than that of O2/O2–. In addition, the photoexcited holes in the valence band (VB) of
g-C3N4 were transferred to the VB of BiOCl since
the VB potential of g-C3N4 was more positive
than that of BiOCl. However, the holes in the VB of BiOCl could not
oxidize OH– to ·OH due to the more negative
VB in BiOCl than the value of ·OH/OH–. From
the above analysis, it could be found that the generated O2– played a crucial role in photodegradation of
RhB.

RhB mechanism under visible light over the heterostructured BiOCl/g-C3N4 photocatalyst.

Conclusions
In summary, the heterostructured 2D/2D
BiOCl/g-C3N4 photosamples were successfully
synthesized through a facile in situ one-pot hydrothermal method,
and the influence of different BiOCl/g-C3N4 ratios
on visible light photodegradation of RhB was investigated. Compared
to sole BiOCl and sole g-C3N4, the combination
of BiOCl and g-C3N4 promoted the photocatalytic
performance. Among all composites, the B2C1 sample displayed the highest
degradation efficiency, which yielded over 90% in only 30 min and
reached almost 100% within the whole 70 min reaction time. The enhancement
on photodegradation was ascribed to the impinged contact between the
two sole materials to form the heterostructure, which could benefit
the generation of abundant visible-light photoinduced carriers and
help enhance the segregation of these charges and then promote their
transportation to the surface. This work provides a strategy for the
preparation of 2D/2D hetero-structured photo-samples with high visible
light photocatalytic efficiency in a simple and economic way.

Experimental Section
Chemical and Materials
Melamine, ethanol, bismuth nitrate
(Bi(NO3)3·5H2O), cetyltrimethyl
ammonium bromide (CTAB), carbamide, and glycerinum were all from Sinopharm
Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. (China). The reagents were all of analytical
grade and utilized without further handling. Deionized water (H2O) after being Millipore system-purified was used throughout
all experiments.

Synthesis of Pure g-C3N4
g-C3N4 was obtained from the simple calcination of
melamine. Typically, 5 g of melamine was put in a 50 mL capped ceramic
crucible and heated to 550 °C with the rate of 2 °C/min
in the air atmosphere for 4 h. The final yellow powder was obtained,
named as CN.

Preparation of BiOCl/g-C3N4
The
2D/2D heterostructured BiOCl/g-C3N4 was constructed
via a simple in situ hydrothermal strategy. First, g-C3N4 was dispersed in 50 mL of ethanol. The suspension solution
was stirred with a magneton for 1 h and further dispersed with ultrasound
for another 1 h. Then, Bi(NO3)3·5H2O, CTAB, and urea were added into the above solution according
to the mole ratio of 3:1:1; the additional 5 mL of glycerinum was
also adopted. Another 1 h of stirring was conducted. Then, the suspension
system was poured into a 100 mL Teflon container, sealed in an autoclave,
and hydrothermally reacted at 180 °C for 24 h. When the container
was cooled to room temperature naturally, the product was washed and
centrifuged with H2O and ethanol several times. The product
was obtained after vacuum drying at 60 °C for 6 h. The synthesized
catalysts were noted as B3C1, B2C1, B1C1, B1C2, and B1C3 separately,
which corresponded to the mole ratio of Bi(NO3)3·5H2O to g-C3N4 with 3:1, 2:1,
1:1, 1:2, and 1:3, respectively. The pure BiOCl was also prepared
for comparison. The preparation process was like the construction
of the BiOCl/g-C3N4 composite, except that g-C3N4 was absent in the solution. The pure BiOCl was
named as Bi.

Characterizations
Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns
of the photocatalysts were conducted on an XD-3 diffractometer (Beijing
Purkinje General Instrument Co., Ltd., China). Fourier transform infrared
(FT-IR) spectra were analyzed on an IS10 FT-IR spectrometer (Nicolet,
U.S.A.) by mixing the samples with KBr. The morphologies of the photocatalysts
were observed through a Quanta 250F field-emission scanning electron
microscope (FE-SEM) (FEI, U.S.A.) and JEM-2100 high-resolution transmission
electron microscope (HR-TEM) (JEOL, Japan). The energy-dispersive
X-ray spectra (EDS) and elemental mappings were also collected on
the SEM instrument. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was applied
to collect the electron states on the surface of the catalysts, which
were obtained on an ESCALAB 250 spectrometer (Thermo, U.S.A.). Diffuse
reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) on a Shimadzu UV-2550 UV–vis
spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, Japan) was carried out for the characterization
of UV–vis absorption spectra of catalysts. The photoluminescence
spectra (PL) were studied by ELabram-HR800.

Photoelectrochemical Analysis
The photoelectrochemical
properties of the catalysts were obtained on a CHI 760B electrochemical
workstation (CH Instruments Inc., China) with a conventional three-electrode
system in which a Pt wire was applied as the counter electrode and
an Ag/AgCl electrode (3 M KCl) served as the reference. The electrolyte
was obtained by the dissolution of Na2SO4 to
form a 0.5 M aqueous solution. The working photoelectrodes were synthesized
as follows. Ten milligrams of photocatalyst powder was dispersed in
the mixed solution containing 1 mL of ethanol and 10 μL of naphthol.
After sufficient dispersion, the suspension solution was dropped on
the fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) conductive glass. The coated area
was fixed at 1 cm2, and the amount of the drop was the
same for all samples. After drying at 180 °C for 12 h in a vacuum
oven, the final working electrodes were obtained.

Photocatalytic Section
The photodegradation tests of
RhB were conducted for all samples at room temperature and atmospheric
pressure. Typically, 15 mg of the photocatalyst was dispersed in a
100 mL RhB solution to form the suspension, and the concentration
of RhB was set as 25 mg/L. The suspension was blended using a magneton
for 0.5 h in the dark to evade the effect of adsorption. Next, the
adsorption-balanced suspension was irradiated with 300 W of xenon
(Xe) light (CEL-HXF300, Beijing CEAulight Co., Ltd., China) with a
light filter of 420 nm, and 6 mL of the suspension was fetched out
every 10 min. The suspension was centrifuged to remove the catalyst,
and then 4 mL of the supernatant was taken for the following analysis.
It is worth mentioning that circulating cooling water was placed around
the reactor to avoid the influence of irradiation-generated heat.
The RhB concentration in the fetched-out solution was measured via
the peak absorption intensity at 553 nm. The blank test was conducted
in the absence of a catalyst for comparison.
