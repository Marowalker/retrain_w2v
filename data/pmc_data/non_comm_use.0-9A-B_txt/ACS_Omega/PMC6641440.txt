We
demonstrate a new approach for the unzipping of single-walled
carbon nanotube (SWCNT) in an aqueous solution using the transition
metal complex PdCl42– as a sacrificial
chemical scissor and the growth of graphitic-carbon-coated Pd nanoparticles
for the electrocatalytic oxidation of formic acid. The chemical unzipping
and the growth of Pd nanoparticles involve the spontaneous electron
transfer between SWCNT and the metal complex in an aqueous solution
at room temperature. The redox potential for SWCNT and PdCl42– favors the spontaneous electron transfer reaction.
The metal complex, in situ generated Pd nanoparticle, and oxygen play
vital role in the oxidative unzipping of SWCNT. The Pd nanoparticles
have an average size of 11 nm and are coated with the graphitic carbon
layer of unzipped SWCNT (UzCNT-Pd). The Pd nanoparticle of the UzCNT-Pd
hybrid material has a large electrochemically active surface area
of 2.14 cm2. The hybrid material exhibits excellent electrocatalytic
activity toward the oxidation of formic acid. The area and mass specific
activity are significantly higher than those of the traditional carbon-supported
Pd nanoparticle. The synergistic effect of graphitic carbon and the
metal nanoparticles controls the catalytic activity. The confinement
of Pd particles inside the graphitic carbon enhances the overall performance
of the catalyst.

Introduction
Graphene, the one-atom-thick,
two-dimensional honeycomb carbon
network has received immense interest owing to the unique properties.1−3 The high mechanical strength, excellent electrical conductivity,
and large surface area made it a wonder material for various applications.
Graphene-based materials including the hybrid material derived from
graphene/reduced graphene oxide (rGO) and metal/metal oxide/metal
nitride/metal sulfide nanoparticles have been extensively used in
electrocatalysis. For instance, the hybrid materials derived from
rGO and metals, metal oxides/hydroxides, carbides, nitrides, etc.
have been well exploited for the development of electrocatalytic interfaces,
sensors, biosensors, energy conversion, and storage devices by taking
advantage of the high electrical conductivity of graphene and mechanical
stability.4−9 The ideal integration of graphene/rGO and metal or metal oxide nanoparticles
significantly enhances the overall performance of the hybrid possibly
due to synergistic effect.10 However, the
quality of graphene/rGO has significant contribution to the catalytic
activity.11 The presence of defects and
oxygen-containing functionalities in rGO and debris along with the
rGO layers can limit the performance of the material.12 Moreover, the restacking of individual graphitic layers
due to π–π* interaction significantly alters the
properties.

Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are made of graphene sheets
seamlessly
rolled into a concentric tube. The unzipping of carbon nanotube (CNT)
is a promising approach to obtain high-quality graphene nanoribbon
or graphene nano-strips. Several methods, including chemical oxidation,
electron beam, steam and plasma etching, hydrothermal, electrochemical,
intercalation, etc., have been documented in the literature for the
unzipping of CNTs.13−20 In the chemical oxidation method, the overoxidation of edges generates
defects and a large number of oxygen-containing functionalities. The
nature of the oxidizing agent actually controls the unzipping of CNT
as well as the defects in the graphene sheet. The hybrid material
based on metal nanoparticle and unzipped CNT can be a promising catalyst
for electrocatalytic applications. The in situ growth of metal nanoparticles
and unzipping of CNT will ensure the ideal integration of the metal
nanoparticle with the honeycomb carbon network and the possible encapsulation
of metal particles with graphitic carbon layer. Moreover, presence
of nanoscale metal particles can effectively prevent the restacking
of individual carbon nanolayers. Such hybrid materials and carbon-encapsulated
catalysts are expected to be electrocatalytically highly active due
to possible synergistic effect.4−9,21,22 The metal and metal oxide nanoparticles encapsulated in graphitic
carbon are very promising for catalytic applications.23−26 The confinement of catalyst particles into the carbon layer assures
the long-time stability and durability during catalytic process.26 The electronic interaction between the graphitic
layers and the metal catalyst contributes to enhanced activity.26 The loss of surface area due to aggregation
of the catalyst particles and the unwanted adsorption of the reactant/product
can be avoided with such encapsulated catalyst. In an attempt to synthesize
an electrocatalytically active hybrid material of honeycomb carbon
network and Pd nanoparticles, we developed a new one-pot approach
using a single-walled CNT (SWCNT) and Pd complex. The unzipping of
SWCNT and the synthesis of hybrid material are achieved at room temperature
without using any harsh oxidizing agent. Although several unzipping
methods have been developed, including the metal-assisted unzipping
procedure in the presence of harsh oxidizing agent,13,27 to the best of our knowledge, this is the first report that describes
the use of Pd-based metal complex as a sacrificial chemical scissor
and the one-pot synthesis of hybrid electrocatalyst of unzipped SWCNT
and Pd nanoparticles in the absence of any additional oxidizing agent
for electrocatalytic application.

Results and Discussion
Unzipping
of SWCNT and Characterization of Hybrid Catalyst
The synthesis
of UzCNT-Pd hybrid catalyst involves the K2PdCl4-assisted unzipping of SWCNT and the growth of Pd
nanoparticles as shown in Figure 1. It is known that SWCNTs can undergo redox reaction
with metal ions of suitable redox potential and such a galvanic displacement
reaction has been exploited for the electroless deposition of metal
nanoparticles. The redox potential of SWCNT is +0.5 V (standard hydrogen
electrode) and, in principle, the metal ions having the reduction
potential >0.5 V can undergo spontaneous galvanic displacement
reaction
with SWCNTs in an aqueous solution.28,29 Dai’s
group has explored the deposition of metal nanoparticles on CNTs without
any reducing agents. The galvanic displacement reaction between CNT
and the metal precursors yields metal nanoparticles. However, the
oxidative cleavage/opening of CNT has not been noticed earlier. In
our case, the reduction potential of PdCl42–/Pd redox couple (0.599 V) is higher than that of SWCNT and hence
a spontaneous electron transfer between SWCNT and PdCl42– complex is expected. Such an electron-transfer
reaction converts the metal complex into metal atom without any additional
reducing agent. The subsequent nucleation and growth produces Pd nanoparticles.
On the other hand, the spontaneous electron-transfer reaction oxidatively
unzips the SWCNT. To follow the unzipping and the growth of Pd nanoparticles,
the TEM measurements have been performed at different time intervals
(Figure 2). The length
of purified SWCNT is > 5 μm and the integrity of SWCNT
does not change during the purification process by acid treatment
(Figure S1). However, significant change
in the morphology was observed after the treatment with PdCl42–. For instance, the sample collected at 12 h
of the reaction evidences the growth of Pd nanoparticles without any
significant change in the morphology of SWCNT. Partial unzipping of
SWCNT is noticed when the reaction time is increased to 24 h and complete
unzipping is observed in 48 h. It should be mentioned here that no
such morphological change is noticed in the absence of Pd complex,
indicating the vital role of the complex. The in situ produced Pd
nanoparticles are not uniform in size. Although few particles have
the size of >25 nm, most of the Pd particles have the size distribution
between 6 and 19 nm (inset of Figure 2C) with an average diameter of  11 nm. The high-resolution
TEM (HRTEM) image shows that the Pd particles are coated with a graphene
layer (Figure 2D–F).
Because the diameter of SWCNT is 2 nm, the unzipped CNT sheet from
a single SWCNT cannot encapsulate the Pd particle. However, as the
length of SWCNT is >5 μm, the UzCNT sheets from two or more
SWCNTs can encapsulate/coat the Pd nanoparticles. The fringe spacing
of Pd nanoparticle corresponds to (111) plane of face centered cubic
lattice. The spotty selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern
shows the crystalline nature of the Pd nanoparticles. The lattice
fringe spacing of the graphitic carbon in the hybrid catalyst is measured
to be 0.37 nm, which is close to that of the other unzipped CNT available
in the literature.30 The X-ray diffraction
(XRD) measurements show (Figure 3) characteristic diffractions at 40.12, 46.65, 68.04,
81.91, and 86.42° corresponding to the (111), (200), (220), (311),
and (222) planes of face-centered cubic Pd (JCPDS 46-1043). The broad
diffraction observed at ∼23.34° is ascribed to the graphitic
carbon network of the unzipped SWCNT. The TEM image of physical mixture
of SWCNT/Pd (experimental section for details) shows the Pd nanoparticles
have an average size of 10 nm (Figure S1).

are shown in the inset of (C), (D), and (E), respectively.

Figure 3 XRD profile of UzCNT-Pd hybrid catalyst.

To further ascertain the unzipping of SWCNT and
the growth of Pd
nanoparticles, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements
have been performed. Figure 4A is the surface survey scan profile of a UzCNT-Pd hybrid
material. Characteristic signatures for Pd, C, and O are obtained.
The deconvoluted C 1s spectra of both purified SWCNT and UzCNT-Pd
hybrid material show the presence of C=C (283.9 eV), C–C
(284.5 eV), and C–O (285.46 eV).31 The (π–π*) shakeup satellite characteristic of
delocalized π-conjugation is observed at 290.1 eV.32 However, in the case of UzCNT-Pd, a significant
decrease (32–47%) in the ratios (C=C/C–C) and
(C=C/C–O) of the areas corresponding to C=C,
C–C, and C–O compared to the purified SWCNT is noticed.
Such a decrease implies the increase in C–C and C–O
in the carbon network due to the unzipping of SWCNT. The high-resolution
Pd 3d XPS profile (Figure 4B) shows the characteristic 3d5/2 and 3d3/2 signatures corresponding to the metallic Pd at 335.5 and 340.8 eV,
respectively.33 A close look at the Pd
3d profile of UzCNT-Pd shows a slight downshift (∼0.4 eV) with
respect to SWCNT/Pd (Figure S2), suggesting
a decrease in the D-band center.34,35 Such a downshift
can weaken the chemisorption of oxygen-containing species and favor
the facile oxidation of formic acid. The chemical unzipping of SWCNT
is known to increase the defects by decreasing the sp2 domain.
Raman spectroscopy is a powerful technique to characterize the ordered
and disordered environments in the carbon network.32 In a typical Raman spectral profile of graphene or rGO,
the D-band is ascribed to the defects introduced into the sp2 hybridized carbon networks and the intensity of this band is proportional
to the defects concentration.36 The G-band
arises from the E2g vibrational mode of sp2-carbon
network. The ratio of the intensity (ID/IG) can be used as a qualitative measure
of the defects in the carbon network.37 As shown in Figure 5A, the ID/IG ratio of the UzCNT-Pd is ∼4 times higher than that of the
as-purchased and purified SWCNT possibly due to the generation of
oxygen-containing functionalities. Furthermore, the chemical unzipping
affects its regular tubular structure, as seen from the TEM images
(Figure 2B,C) and observable
increase in the intensity of D-band is noticed and hence the ID/IG ratio. The
Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectral profile evidences the increase
in the intensity of the bands corresponding to the oxygen-containing
functionalities such as carboxyl C=O (∼1720 cm–1), epoxy C–O (∼1220 cm–1), alkoxy
C–O (∼1100 cm–1), and hydroxyl −OH
(∼3410 cm–1), further confirming the oxidative
unzipping of SWCNT (Figure 5B). The presence of C=C band (∼1650 cm–1) in the FTIR spectral profile reveals that the graphitic structure
is retained upon unzipping, though a slight decrease in band intensity
at 1650 cm–1 is observed.13,19,38 Such a decrease in the intensity is in agreement
with the Raman spectral measurements. The new peaks observed at 2860
and 2930 cm–1 are ascribed to sp3 C–H
stretching vibration.

Time-dependent UV–vis spectral
measurement is performed
to confirm the reduction of PdCl42– to
Pd(0). PdCl42– is known to show a strong
absorption in the tail end of the UV region (200–270 nm) and
a weak absorption at ∼413 nm.39 A
gradual decrease in the spectral bands in the visible and UV regions
corresponding to PdCl42– was noticed
during the reaction (Figure 6A), indicating that the metal complex is consumed during the
reaction. The disappearance of the characteristic signature of metal
complex confirms the reduction of metal complex (Figure 6A). It may be argued that the
decrease in the absorbance could be due to the irreversible adsorption
of PdCl42– onto the SWCNT surface. Although
such an adsorption of the complex on the surface of SWCNT may not
be ruled out, no spectral signature for the adsorbed complex is noticed,
ascertaining that the decrease in the absorbance is actually due to
the reduction of the complex to Pd(0). It is worth pointing out here
that no observable decrease in the absorbance is noticed when the
reaction is conducted in an inert atmosphere (Figure 6B), suggesting that (i) PdCl42– does not irreversibly adsorb on SWCNT and (ii) atmospheric
oxygen has role in the unzipping and reduction of the PdCl42–. The palladium-catalyzed cleavage of the C–C
double and triple bonds in the presence of oxygen has been demonstrated
in the past.40,41 In our case, although the detailed
mechanism of unzipping is not well understood in the present stage,
it is considered that the room temperature oxidative cleavage of SWCNT
could be similar to the Pd-catalyzed C–C cleavage of the alkene-involving
PdCl42–, in situ generated Pd(0), and
oxygen. The metal complex, in situ generated Pd nanoparticles, and
oxygen play important role in the oxidative scissoring of SWCNT.

spectral profile obtained during the unzipping
of SWCNT. (B) Spectral profile of K2PdCl4 illustrating

Electrocatalytic Oxidation of Formic Acid
The electrochemical
oxidation of formic acid on metal electrode surface can follow either
(i) dehydration or (ii) dehydrogenation pathway, depending on the
nature of the electrode material. The dehydration pathway involves
the generation of a poisonous surface-adsorbed intermediate, CO. The
dehydrogenation pathway produces CO2 by the direct oxidation
of formic acid. The latter pathway is preferred, as it does not involve
catalyst poisoning. The traditional Pt catalyst is known to follow
the dehydration pathway, whereas the Pd-based catalysts favor the
dehydrogenation pathway. Because the carbon-supported catalysts are
known to show high catalytic activity and the Pd-based catalysts promote
the dehydrogenation pathway for the electrochemical oxidation of formic
acid, we have exploited the UzCNT-Pd hybrid material for the oxidation
of formic acid. The hybrid material shows the characteristic voltammetric
signature corresponding to the surface oxide formation and its reduction
and hydrogen adsorption and desorption (Figure 7A). The careful analysis of the voltammetric
profiles reveals that the potential corresponding to surface oxide
reduction on the UzCNT-Pd is more positive (∼60 mV) compared
to as-synthesized unsupported Pd nanoparticle. Such a shift can be
ascribed to the reduced oxophilicity and weak bonding of oxygen-containing
species, such as OHad and COad, on the surface
of Pd nanoparticle.34,35,42 The graphitic carbon confinement of the Pd nanoparticle plays an
important role in controlling the surface property of the nanoparticles.
The electrochemically accessible surface area (ECSA) of Pd is estimated
by the CO-stripping method.35,43 The magnitude of the
stripping peak is proportional to the ECSA of Pd nanoparticles, and
the charge associated with the stripping (Figure 7B) of adsorbed CO (QCO) is used to calculate the surface area.44 The ECSA of Pd in UzCNT-Pd, SWCNT/Pd, rGO/Pd, and unsupported
as-synthesized Pd nanoparticles are calculated to be 2.14, 1.21, 1.02,
and 0.8729 cm2, respectively. The CO-stripping peak potential
of UzCNT-Pd is significantly less positive (∼60 mV) than that
of the as-synthesized unsupported Pd nanoparticles, indicating the
facile oxidation of CO due to weak adsorption. It is well known that
the CO tolerance of catalysts plays an important role in achieving
facile electron transfer for the oxidation of formic acid. On Pd-based
electrocatalyst, CO is formed during the electrochemical reduction
of in situ generated CO2 rather than through the dehydration
pathway of formic acid oxidation.45,46 The CO-tolerant
electrocatalysts are highly preferred for the development of formic
acid fuel cell. The catalyst that weakly binds to CO or favors the
facile oxidation of CO at a less positive potential has a high tolerance
toward poisoning CO species. As discussed earlier, the downshift in
the d-band center weakens the binding of CO on the surface of Pd nanoparticles
of UzCNT-Pd hybrid material.47

Figure 7 Characteristic
cyclic voltammetric (A) and CO stripping profiles
(B) of UzCNT-Pd, SWCNT/Pd, rGO/Pd, and Pd in 0.5 M H2SO4 at a scan rate of 50 mV s–1. CO stripping
was performed in CO saturated electrolyte.

Figure 8 illustrates
the electrocatalytic response of the hybrid material toward the oxidation
of formic acid. The large anodic peak obtained while sweeping from
a less positive to a more positive potential corresponds to the oxidation
of formic acid. As can be seen, only one voltammetric peak is noticed,
suggesting that the hybrid material promotes the dehydrogenation pathway
for the oxidation of formic acid. The electrocatalytic activity is
evaluated in terms of the onset potential and current density. The
hybrid catalyst shows the onset and the oxidation peak potential in
the forward sweep at 183 and 620 mV, respectively. The ECSA and mass-normalized
current density at the potential of 0.62 V is found to be 117 mA cm–2 and 1.995 A mgPd–1,
respectively. This is significantly higher (3–6 times) than
those of the SWCNT/Pd and as-synthesized unsupported Pd nanoparticles,
highlighting the high electrocatalytic activity of the hybrid material.
To highlight the electrocatalytic activity of the hybrid material,
the formic acid oxidation has also been performed with SWCNT/Pd, unsupported
as-synthesized Pd, and rGO/Pd (Figures 8 and S3). The ECSA and mass-normalized
current density on the hybrid material are significantly higher than
those of SWCNT/Pd, unsupported as-synthesized Pd, and rGO/Pd nanoparticles,
further highlighting the excellent catalytic activity of the hybrid
material. The electrocatalytic activity of the hybrid material is
largely dependent on the mass loading on the electrode surface (Figure S4). The effect of mass loading on the
catalytic activity is evaluated in terms of mass-normalized current
density in the forward sweep at the potential of 0.62 V. A high mass
activity and a less positive oxidation peak potential are obtained
at a mass loading of 0.0247 mgPd cm–2.

Figure 8 Cyclic voltammograms illustrating the electrocatalytic activity
of UzCNT-Pd hybrid catalyst toward formic acid oxidation in 0.5 M
H2SO4 at a scan rate of 50 mV s–1. The area- and mass-normalized current is shown in (A) and (B).

The electrocatalytic response
of the UzCNT-Pd hybrid material is
highly stable; the peak current and peak potential do not change upon
repeated sweeps. To further evaluate the stability of the electrode,
amperometric measurements at the potential of 620 mV for 3600 s are
performed (Figure S5) and then the same
electrode is subjected to voltammetric experiment for the oxidation
of formic acid. Unlike the as-synthesized unsupported Pd and SWCNT-supported
Pd nanoparticles, the amperometric response at the UzCNT-Pd hybrid
materials is highly stable for a long time. Moreover, the shape of
the voltammogram, peak current, and oxidation peak potential does
not change significantly (Figure S5) even
after subjecting to amperometric experiment. The hybrid material retains
94% of the initial current even after subjecting to chronoamperometric
measurements for 3600 s, implying the durability of the catalyst;
it does not undergo poisoning during the oxidation of formic acid.
The high stability can be attributed to the ideal integration of Pd
nanoparticles and the UzCNTs. The UzCNT layer on the Pd nanoparticles
ensures the enhanced durability and overall electrocatalytic performance.
In the case of SWCNT/Pd and as-synthesized unsupported Pd, ∼15–20%
drop in the initial current is noticed, suggesting the lack of durability
of these catalysts. Although SWCNT/Pd has a carbon support, it cannot
retain the initial catalytic activity, possibly due to the loss of
surface area by the aggregation of Pd nanoparticles. In terms of mass-specific
activity, the performance of our hybrid catalyst is superior to that
of the other Pd-based catalysts available in the literature (Table S1). For instance, Matsumoto’s group
has prepared recently carbon-supported Pd3Pb intermetallics
and achieved a mass-normalized current density of ∼4.5 mA mgPd–1.45 Zhang’s
group obtained a mass-normalized activity of 1655.7 ± 74.6 mA
mgPd–1 with PdCu bimetallic alloy.48 Sun’s group achieved a mass activity
of ∼1600 mA mgPd–1 using tungsten
oxide nanorod-supported Pd nanoparticles.49 The ternary Pd-Ni-P/CNT hybrid catalyst exhibits a mass activity
of 1457 mA mgPd–1.50 Feng’s group achieved 1250 mA mgPd–1 with the core–shell Au@AuPd catalyst.51 Our hybrid catalyst exhibits a high mass- and
area-normalized current density and has a high durability compared
to the bimetallic and intermetallic electrocatalysts. The graphitic
confinement prevents the sintering of Pd nanoparticles during the
electrocatalytic reaction and enhances the overall catalytic performance.

Summary
A new approach for the unzipping of SWCNT and the
synthesis of
electrocatalytically active hybrid catalyst based on the unzipped
SWCNT and Pd nanoparticle is demonstrated for the first time. The
present approach does not involve the use of harsh oxidizing agent
for the unzipping of SWCNT. The PdCl42– complex, in situ generated Pd nanoparticles, and oxygen are involved
in the oxidative unzipping of SWCNT. The method presented here has
the advantage of producing graphitic-carbon-coated electrocatalytically
active Pd nanoparticle and unzipped CNT in one pot. The electrocatalytic
performance is evaluated with the oxidation of formic acid. Unlike
the traditional carbon-supported Pd nanoparticles, the hybrid material
has a high electrocatalytic activity and efficiently catalyses the
oxidation of formic acid. The synergistic effect of unzipped SWCNT
and nanosize Pd nanoparticles facilitates the electron transfer for
the oxidation of formic acid. The confinement of Pd nanoparticles
inside the graphitic carbon layer actually plays an important role
in enhancing the overall electrocatalytic performance.

Materials and
Methods
Materials
SWCNT of ∼2 nm diameter and 5–15
μm length was purchased from TCI (Japan) chemicals. Potassium
tetrachloropalladate (K2PdCl4), Nafion (5% in
lower aliphatic alcohol), and formic acid were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich.
All of the other chemicals were of analytical grade. All of the solutions
used in this investigation were prepared with Millipore water (Milli-Q
system).

Instrumentation
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM)
images of the nanoparticles are obtained with FEI-TECNAI G2 20S-TWIN
electron microscope operating at 200 kV voltages. Carbon-coated copper
grids (400 mesh) were used to prepare the TEM sample. X-ray diffraction
(XRD) analysis was performed with a Bruker D8 advance unit using Cu
Kα (λ = 1.54 Å) radiation. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS) analysis was carried out with custom-built laboratory version
ambient pressure photoelectron spectrometer (Lab-APPES). Raman spectra
were acquired using 488 nm argon–krypton mixed ion gas laser
(power 80 mW) as an excitation source in backscattering geometry,
equipped with a single monochromator (model T64000, Jobin Yvon Horiba,
France) with an Optical Microscope (model BX41) and a thermoelectric
cooled front illuminated 1024 256 charge coupled device detector.
The laser beam was focused on the sample using a 50× objective
lens to a spot size ∼2 μm diameter. Fourier transform
infrared (FTIR) spectroscopic measurements were performed with a Perkin-Elmer
FTIR spectrophotometer RX1. Electronic absorption spectra were recorded
using a CARY 5000 UV–vis–NIR spectrophotometer. All
of the electrochemical experiments were performed with a CHI643B electrochemical
analyzer attached to a Faraday cage/picoampere booster (CH Instruments,
Austin, TX). A two-compartment three-electrode cell with glassy carbon
(GC) working, Pt wire auxiliary, and Ag/AgCl reference electrodes
was used for electrochemical measurements. All of the potentials are
referred against reversible hydrogen electrode.

Purification
of SWCNT
The as-purchased SWCNT was purified
by acid treatment. Typically, SWCNT (2.5 mg) was dispersed in 5 mL
HNO3 solution (1 M) and sonicated for 1 h to remove the
impurities. The purified SWCNT was collected by centrifugation after
repeated washing with copious amount of Millipore water.

Unzipping of
SWCNT and Synthesis of Hybrid Catalyst
In a typical procedure,
purified SWCNT (0.5 mg mL–1) was dispersed in 5
mL H2O by ultrasonication. An aqueous
solution of K2PdCl4 (5 μM) was then added
to the dispersion under constant stirring and the stirring was continued
for 48 h at room temperature. The product (UzCNT-Pd) was then collected
at different time intervals (12, 24, and 48 h) by centrifugation and
washed with water and dried under vacuum. The supernatant solution
was collected and characterized with UV–vis measurement to
check the presence of Pd complex. The SWCNT-supported Pd nanoparticle
(SWCNT/Pd) was synthesized according to the following procedures.
An aqueous solution of K2PdCl4 (5 mM) was mixed
with the required amount of reducing agent NaBH4 under
constant stirring. The Pd nanoparticle was then mixed with an aqueous
dispersion of SWCNT (0.5 mg mL–1) under stirring
in a magnetic stirrer for 12 h. The mixture was centrifuged to collect
SWCNT/Pd and dried under vacuum before subjecting to further analysis.
The reduced graphene oxide (rGO)-supported Pd nanoparticle (rGO/Pd)
was prepared in two steps. Graphene oxide (GO) was first reduced to
rGO by conventional borohydride reduction method. In a typical procedure,
NaBH4 (200 mg) was slowly added to the GO dispersion in
H2O (1 mg mL–1) and stirred for 20 min.
The black product was then collected by centrifugation and dried in
vacuum. The rGO/Pd was obtained by mixing the required amount of Pd
nanoparticles with an aqueous rGO dispersion (0.5 mg mL–1) and stirring the mixture for 12 h. The rGO/Pd was collected by
centrifugation and dried in vacuum.

Electrode Modification
GC electrodes of diameter 3
mm were polished well with alumina slurry of 0.7 and 0.3 μm
to obtain a mirror finish surface. The polished electrode was sonicated
in Millipore water for 2–3 min and thoroughly rinsed with Millipore
water and used for modification. The catalyst ink was prepared by
mixing the hybrid materials (0.2 mg) with 200 μL of Nafion solution
and sonicated for 60 min. Nafion solution was prepared by adding Nafion
(100 μL) to the 3:2:1 mixture of ethanol/dimethylformamide/water
(900 μL). Then, the catalyst ink (5 μL) was drop-casted
on the cleaned GC electrode and dried at ambient condition. The mass
loading of the hybrid catalyst on the electrode surface was calculated
to be 0.0247 mgPd cm–2.
