We investigated the
hydride reduction of tetragonal BaTiO3 using the metal
hydrides CaH2, NaH, MgH2,
NaBH4, and NaAlH4. The reactions employed molar
BaTiO3/H ratios of up to 1.8 and temperatures near 600
°C. The air-stable reduced products were characterized by powder
X-ray diffraction (PXRD), transmission electron microscopy, thermogravimetric
analysis (TGA), and 1H magic angle spinning (MAS) NMR spectroscopy.
PXRD showed the formation of cubic products—indicative of the
formation of BaTiO3–xHx—except for NaH. Lattice parameters were in
a range between 4.005 Å (for NaBH4-reduced samples)
and 4.033 Å (for MgH2-reduced samples). With increasing
H/BaTiO3 ratio, CaH2-, NaAlH4-, and
MgH2-reduced samples were afforded as two-phase mixtures.
TGA in air flow showed significant weight increases of up to 3.5%
for reduced BaTiO3, suggesting that metal hydride reduction
yielded oxyhydrides BaTiO3–xHx with x values larger than
0.5. 1H MAS NMR spectroscopy, however, revealed rather
low concentrations of H and thus a simultaneous presence of O vacancies
in reduced BaTiO3. It has to be concluded that hydride
reduction of BaTiO3 yields complex disordered materials
BaTiO3–xHy□(x–y) with x up to 0.6 and y in a range
0.04–0.25, rather than homogeneous solid solutions BaTiO3–xHx.
Resonances of (hydridic) H substituting O in the cubic perovskite
structure appear in the −2 to −60 ppm spectral region.
The large range of negative chemical shifts and breadth of the signals
signifies metallic conductivity and structural disorder in BaTiO3–xHy□(x–y). Sintering of
BaTiO3–xHy□(x–y) in a gaseous H2 atmosphere resulted in more ordered materials,
as indicated by considerably sharper 1H resonances.

1 Introduction
Hydride
reduction has developed into a versatile method for modifying
transition metal oxides, yielding highly reduced products with unusual
coordination environments and exotic electronic and magnetic properties.1−4 Especially fruitful precursors are oxides that relate to perovskite
and Ruddlesden–Popper phases. Specific prominent examples are
the LaNiO3 to LaNiO2, SrFeO3 to SrFeO2, and YBaCo2O5 to YBaCo2O4.5 reductions.5−7 In a typical hydride reduction, a ternary transition
metal oxide is reacted with CaH2, NaH, or LiH at relatively
mild, low temperature (“chimie douce”) conditions (150–600
°C). The reduction is accompanied with O removal (i.e., O vacancy
formation), and frequently, there is a strict topotactic relationship
between the original oxide and its reduced form. In rare cases, transition
metal reduction and hydride ion insertion occur simultaneously, leading
to oxyhydrides.8 This scenario is thought
to be highly unusual because of the incompatibility of O2– and strongly reducing H– in forming a common anion
substructure.9

It then came as a
surprise when in 2012 Kobayashi et al. reported
that the reaction of CaH2 with the archetypical perovskite
BaTiO3 affords BaTiO3–xHx with large amounts (x < 0.6) of hydrogen incorporated.10 The cubic perovskite oxyhydride BaTiO3–xHx is remarkable in several respects.
It represents a defect-/vacancy-free solid solution of O2– and H– ions, which commonly form the octahedral
environment around Ti that is now in a mixed IV/III oxidation state
(Figure 1a). BaTiO3–xHx is
stable in air and water. Further, it is stable at elevated temperatures
of up to approximately 400 °C above which hydrogen is released.
When present, oxygen is scavenged and BaTiO3 is retained.
In inert gas atmospheres containing D2, a hydride exchange
H/D occurs at hydrogen release temperatures. Also, oxynitrides BaTiO3−δNy may be prepared
by heating BaTiO3–xHx under N2 flow at 400–600 °C.11 These observations led to the conclusion that
the hydride species in BaTiO3–xHx is labile and that the material represents
a versatile precursor toward new mixed-anion compounds.12 Sakaguchi et al.13 and Yamamoto et al.14 showed that perovskite
oxyhydrides are also obtained with CaTiO3, SrTiO3, and EuTiO3 although with smaller hydride contents x (<0.3). A high degree of O2–/H– exchange was further observed for cubic SrVO3 for which topochemical hydride reduction with CaH2 yields
tetragonal SrVO2H.15 Remarkably,
the structure of SrVO2H is fully anion-ordered, displaying
two-dimensional VO2 sheets that are connected by H– ligands (cf. Figure 1b).

Figure 1 (a) Structure of BaTiO2.75H0.25 represented
as the 2 × 2 × 2 supercell of cubic BaTiO3 in
which two O atoms were randomly replaced by two H atoms. The right-hand
side shows the local coordination of H in BaTiO3–xHx. The Ti is in a mixed
IV/III oxidation state. (b) Anion-ordered tetragonal structure of
SrVO2H.15 The alkaline earth
metal, O, and H atoms are depicted as gray, red, and green spheres,
respectively.

Mechanisms or processes
behind metal hydride reductions are not
well investigated and far from understood. They involve intermediates,
which in turn depend on the particular system and conditions applied.
Also, the active reducing species may be H– or H2 or a combination of both. Hayward et al. could show that
the reduction of LiNiO3 with NaH corresponds to a solid-state
diffusion-controlled reaction that proceeds via the intermediate LaNiO2+x.5 For other
systems, there may be significant H2 gas-phase contributions
to reduction.16 Conditions can be varied
by the choice of reducing agents (i.e., metal hydride), reaction temperature
and time, and the activity/concentration of H–.
Hernden et al. performed a comprehensive investigation of the hydride
reduction of Sr2MnO4 and identified a two-electron
transfer H– → H+ (as opposed to
one-electron transfer H– → 1/2H2) during reduction.17 For oxyhydride formation,
additional complexity arises. Are reduction and exchange mechanisms
coupled, or does oxyhydride formation occur via an O vacancy-rich
intermediate? Bridges et al. studied the formation pathway of the
first reported transition metal oxyhydride LaSrCoO3H0.7 from LaSrCoO4.18 From
in situ X-ray diffraction studies, they could identify oxygen-deficient
LaSrCo3O3.38–x as the
reduced intermediate, in which oxide was subsequently substituted
by H–. At the same time, the presence of gas-phase
H2 appeared to be important for achieving the final composition
LaSrCo3H0.7. The proposed three-step mechanism
is rather complex, but it is clear that direct hydride substitution
for oxide, coupled with reduction, is excluded.

An important
question is what factors govern oxyhydride formation
as opposed to exclusive vacancy formation during hydride reduction.
What mechanism could apply for BaTiO3 reduction? Whereas
defined reduced phases can be obtained from LaSrCoO4 (i.e.,
LaSrCoO3.50 and LaSrCoO3.38),18 BaTiO3–x with significant
O deficiency is not known. We report a systematic study of the hydride
reduction of BaTiO3, especially investigating the influence
of reducing agents. In contrast to previous studies, we find that
hydride reduction leads to phases BaTiO3–xHy□(x–y) with comparatively low H content
and, accordingly, large O vacancy concentrations.

2 Experimental Methods
2.1 Synthesis
As starting
materials,
we used BaTiO3 (500 nm particle size, 99.9% purity, ABCR
GmbH) and powders of the metal hydrides CaH2 (99.99%, Sigma-Aldrich),
NaH (95%, Sigma-Aldrich), MgH2 (96.5%, Sigma-Aldrich),
NaBH4 (98%, ABCR GmbH), and NaAlH4 (93%, Sigma-Aldrich).
Prior to use, BaTiO3 was dried overnight in an oven at
200 °C. All steps of sample preparation for the synthesis reactions
were performed in an Ar-filled glovebox. For a typical synthesis,
∼1.4 g (6 mmol) of BaTiO3 was intimately mixed with
metal hydride by grinding the materials together in an agate mortar
for 15 min. We considered the molar proportions BaTiO3 + nH, with n = 0.2, 0.6, 1.2, and 1.8 and
with H = NaH, 0.5 CaH2, 0.5 MgH2, 0.25 NaAlH4, and 0.25 NaBH4. Samples are in the following
termed “n-H-MHn”, to indicate the hydride concentration and hydride source
(M = Na, Ca, Mg, “NaAl”, “NaB”) in the
reaction. The BaTiO3/MHn mixture
was subsequently pressed into a pellet with a diameter of 8 mm. The
pellet was then sealed inside a stainless steel ampule (with dimensions
10 mm ID and 80 mm length), which in turn was placed in a fused silica
jacket.

Following removal from the glovebox, the silica jacket
was placed in a vertical tube furnace and connected to a vacuum line.
The empty space of the furnace was filled with silica insulation wool,
and a K-type thermocouple was introduced parallel to the silica jacket
to monitor the temperature close to the location of the metal ampule.
The silica jacket was then evacuated, and ampules were heated for
times between 1 and 7 days. Reaction temperatures were varied from
500 to 700 °C. Most reactions reported in this work were carried
out at 600 °C in 2 days’ duration. A deuterated sample
1.2-D-CaD2 was prepared by reacting a mixture of BaTiO3 and CaD2 at 600 °C for 2 days. CaD2 was synthesized prior by reacting dendritic pieces of Ca (99.99%
trace metals purity, Sigma-Aldrich) with D2 (99.9% isotope
purity, AGA) in a stainless-steel autoclave pressurized to 30 bar
at 400 °C for 12 h.

Products were washed with 0.1 M CH3COOH (HAc) to remove
excess metal hydride and metal oxide formed during hydride reduction
and dried at 120 °C under dynamic vacuum (<10–5 bar). In order to study the effect of the acidic washing agents,
we also used a 0.1 M NH4Cl/methanol (MeOH) mixture and
0.1 M HCl. For washing, the pellets were crushed and sonicated with
50 mL acidic washing agent for 15 min and then centrifuged. The procedure
was repeated three times. As a last step, samples were treated with
20 mL of pure methanol.

Selected reduced BaTiO3 samples
were subjected to a
posttreatment in which the pellets were heated in a corundum crucible
in a stainless steel autoclave at 600 °C under a pressure of
30–50 bar of hydrogen gas (H2 AGA 99.99% purity)
for 24 h.

2.2 Powder X-ray Diffraction (PXRD) Analysis
Ambient-temperature PXRD patterns were collected on a PANalytical
X’Pert PRO diffractometer operated with Cu Kα1 radiation in θ–2θ diffraction geometry. Powder
samples were mounted on a Si wafer zero-background holder, and diffraction
patterns were measured in a 2θ range of 10–90° with
0.013° step size. In situ high-temperature PXRD studies were
performed on a PANalytical X’Pert PRO instrument with Cu Kα
radiation in θ–2θ diffraction geometry. Samples
were heated in air to 900 °C using an Anton Paar XRK 900 high-temperature
chamber equipped with Be windows and connected to a temperature controller.
Powder samples were mounted on a Au wafer. Data in a 2θ range
of 20–60° were collected at room temperature and then
in steps of 100 °C with 15 min acquisition time and 5 °C/min
heating rate between the steps. Au reflections were used for correction
of the 2θ-scale of data. The contribution of Kα2 radiation to the PXRD patterns was removed using the PANalytical
X’Pert HighScore Plus software. The Rietveld method as implemented
in the FullProf program was used for structure and phase analysis.19 A six-coefficient polynomial function was applied
for the background. The peak shape was described by a pseudo-Voigt
function. Patterns with pronounced peak shape asymmetries were refined
as mixtures of two cubic phases. Site occupancies for the O atoms
could not be refined reliably and were constrained to 1.

2.3 Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) Investigations
The TEM images were recorded using either a JEOL JEM-2100F (Cs = 0.5 mm and point resolution of 1.9 Å)
or a JEOL JEM-2100 microscope (Cs = 1.4
mm and point resolution 2.5 Å). Both microscopes were operated
at room temperature with an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. The TEM
specimens were prepared by crushing the dry powders in an agate mortar,
followed by dispersion in ethanol. One droplet of this suspension
was transferred onto a copper grid coated with a holey-carbon film.

2.4 Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA)
TGA experiments
were carried out using a TA instruments Discovery
system. The samples (∼15 mg powders) were heated in a platinum
crucible from room temperature to 900 °C with a heating rate
of 5 °C/min. A dry air gas flow of 20 mL/min was applied.

2.5 Magic Angle Spinning (MAS) NMR Spectroscopy
The 1H MAS NMR experiments were performed at a magnetic
field of 14.1 T (600.12 MHz 1H Larmor frequency) and a
MAS frequency of 60 kHz on a Bruker AVANCE-III spectrometer equipped
with a 1.3 mm MAS HX probe. Spectra were acquired using a rotor-synchronized,
double-adiabatic spin-echo sequence with a 1.2 μs 90° excitation
pulse length, followed by a pair of 50 μs tanh/tan short high-power
adiabatic pulses (SHAPs) with 5 MHz frequency sweep.20−22 All pulses were applied at a nutation frequency of 208 kHz. Signal
transients (4096) with a 5 s recycle delay were accumulated for each
sample. The shifts were referenced with respect to tetramethylsilane
(TMS) at 0 ppm. The 2H MAS NMR spectrum was recorded on
a 9.4 T (61.41 MHz 2H Larmor frequency) Bruker AVANCE-III
spectrometer with a 2.5 mm MAS HX probe at a spinning frequency of
30 kHz. The same pulse sequence as for protons was used but with a
3.0 μs 90° excitation pulse and 66.67 μs SHAPs at
a nutation frequency of 83 kHz. Scans (4096) with a 20 s recycle delay
were collected. The shifts were referenced to deuterated TMS (TMS-d12) at 0 ppm.

3 Results
and Discussion
3.1 Hydride Reduction of BaTiO3
Kobayashi et al. prepared BaTiO3–xHx by reacting BaTiO3 in the
form of 170 nm sized particles with CaH2 at temperatures
between 500 and 580 °C for 4–7 days in pyrex or fused
silica tubes.10,13 CaH2 was employed
with a rather large excess, 3 M, corresponding to 6 H according to
our nomenclature. The reacted samples were washed with 0.1 M NH4Cl/MeOH in air to remove excess CaH2 as well as
the side product CaO. Very weakly acidic NH4Cl/MeOH is
commonly used as a washing agent for concluding hydride reductions.1−4 The dark blue-colored cubic products were identified as BaTiO3–xHx and
described as a defect-free O2–/H– solid solution containing xTi(III) and 1–xTi(IV) with x up to 0.6.

In the
following, we outline possible processes that occur during the hydride
reduction of BaTiO3. The H– species as
a reductant may transfer one or two electrons toward oxygen vacancy
formation (“one-” and “two”-electron processes,
respectively). In addition, the metal hydride may decompose at elevated
temperatures into hydrogen gas and metal, which can both act as reductants.
H2 gas-phase contribution to hydride reduction reactions
has been demonstrated by Kobayashi et al.16 For oxyhydride formation, H– formally acts by
simultaneously reducing Ti and replacing O2– in
the perovskite structure. However, the reaction may proceed via initial
vacancy formation and subsequent oxidation by gaseous H2. Processes involving hydrogen are summarized in Table 1. Additionally, the explicit
hydride reduction reactions for BaTiO3 are formulated below
for CaH2 (a) and for a generic metal hydride MHn (b).

Note that if hydroxide is formed (two-electron process), it may
most likely not be observed in the ex situ analysis of products because
hydroxide will react with excess hydride to yield oxide and H2 (OH– + H– → O2– + H2).

3.2 Reduction
with CaH2
Our
reactions were performed at 600 °C in welded stainless steel
ampules. The average particle size of the BaTiO3 starting
material was 500 nm, which is slightly larger than the material used
by Kobayashi et al. Products were washed with 0.1 M HAc, which expedited
the procedure considerably compared to the much less acidic NH4Cl/MeOH. From PXRD, TGA, and 1H NMR measurements,
we concluded that the products after washing with 0.1 M HAc and 0.1
M NH4Cl/MeOH were identical (see the Supporting Information, part III). Figure 2 shows the evolution of products with increasing
CaH2 concentration during 2 day experiments at 600 °C,
and Table 2 presents
the results from the refinement of the PXRD patterns. The product
obtained with 0.2 H (“0.2-H-CaH2”) had a
pale blue color and remained tetragonal. With the higher concentrations,
0.6, 1.2, and 1.8 H cubic products were obtained. A higher degree
of reduction with increasing H concentration was recognizable by a
deepening of the color to dark blue, almost black, in agreement with
the observation of Kobayashi et al.10,13 The unit cell
volume of the reduced products is very similar to that of the starting
material, increasing slightly with increasing H concentration. A closer
inspection of the PXRD patterns of 1.2-H-CaH2 and 1.8-H-CaH2 revealed that reflections have a pronounced shoulder at lower
angles, suggesting phase heterogeneity. These patterns were refined
as a mixture of two cubic phases. For both products, the minority
phase had a weight fraction of about 11% and a unit cell parameter
that was larger than that of the majority phase by about 0.014 Å.
We note that the lattice parameter reported by Kobayashi et al. for
BaTiO2.38H0.62, 4.0236 Å,10 is similar to the minority phase of the 1.2-H-CaH2 and 1.8-H-CaH2 samples. Higher concentrations than 1.8
H led to a drastic broadening of reflections and a diminished crystallinity.

The presence of two cubic phases in the 1.2-H-CaH2 and
1.8-H-CaH2 samples, as evidenced from PXRD, could not be
reconciled from TEM investigations. Figure 3a,b shows TEM images of the starting material
and 1.2-H-CaH2, respectively. The morphology of the crystalline
particles is not influenced by the hydride reduction reaction. The
electron diffraction pattern of investigated 1.2-H-CaH2 crystallites, shown in Figure 3c, is cubic without signs of superstructuring or diffuse
scattering. However, the thickness of the crystallites hampered detailed
diffraction studies.

an average particle size of 500 nm according to the specification
of the supplier). (b) TEM image of a 1.2 H CaH2-reduced
sample. (c) Electron diffraction pattern along [001] shows cubic symmetry.

Kobayashi et al. suggested that
TGA represents a convenient way
to assess the H content of BaTiO3–xHx.10,13 TGA under
the flowing air will monitor the reaction 4  according
to which a substantial weight increase
occurs, and thus, a high accuracy can be associated with the determination
of x. The product after TGA (i.e., after heating
and cooling to 900 °C) is white and corresponds to tetragonal
BaTiO3. Figure 4 collects the TGA traces for the CaH2-reduced samples.
All samples show initially a small weight loss (0.1–0.15%)
which we attribute to the loss of surface water/hydroxyls. For the
0.2-H-CaH2 sample, the weight loss continued up to 600
°C, for 0.6-H-CaH2 up to 450 °C, and for 1.2-H-CaH2 and 1.8-H-CaH2 up to 350 °C. The initial
weight loss relates well to the TG behavior of the starting material,
which shows a continuous weight loss amounting to 0.15% up to 700
°C (as shown later). The subsequent weight increase should be
due to oxidation, which for all samples is completed above 700 °C.
The associated x values according to eq 4 are contained in Table 2. The value x = 0.34 for the 1.8-H-CaH2 sample is clearly below the
maximum value reported by Kobayashi et al. (x ≈
0.6).10,13

Figure 4 TGA traces for products obtained from the hydride
reduction of
BaTiO3 at 600 °C during 2 days, using various concentrations
of CaH2.

Figure 5 shows the
lattice parameter variation as a function of temperature as obtained
from a multi-temperature PXRD experiment in which the 1.2-H-CaH2 sample was heated in air to 900 °C and subsequently
cooled. In agreement with the TGA experiment, oxidation occurs between
500 and 600 °C. Above 600 °C, the lattice parameters during
heating and cooling coincide. Upon cooling, the phase transition into
tetragonal BaTiO3 occurs below 200 °C.23 The lattice parameter of the cubic high-temperature
form of BaTiO3 is clearly smaller than that of the reduced
samples [by about 0.07 Å for 1.2-H-CaH2 and by about
0.015 Å for 1.2-H-MgH2 (Supporting Information, Figure S1)].

Figure 5 Evolution of the lattice parameters during
heating and cooling
of 1.2 H CaH2-reduced BaTiO3 in air. Standard
deviations are less than the size of the symbols.

The influence of reaction time is depicted in Figure 6 for the 1.2 H reductions,
and results from the refinement of the PXRD data are compiled in Table 3. All products represent
mixtures of two cubic phases. The 1- and 2 day experiments produced
virtually identical products, which are also very similar to the 4
day experiment, whereas the product of the 7 day experiment is clearly
different. The PXRD pattern shows significantly broader reflections
and also the presence of an impurity phase (Ti3O), which
is indicative of the onset of decomposition of BaTiO3.
The unit cell parameters are increased with respect to the products
obtained after shorter times. Peculiar is the TGA trace, exhibiting
significant weight loss (∼0.4%) between room temperature and
350 °C, after which a weight increase in excess of 3% occurs.
We also mention briefly the influence of temperature. Below 550 °C,
the reactivity of CaH2 is low and a conversion into a cubic
product was not observed after 5 days. Temperatures above 650 °C
represented harsh conditions, equivalent to long reaction times and/or
high concentrations of CaH2, H/BaTiO3 > 4.

To summarize,
we could reproduce the hydride reduction of BaTiO3 with
CaH2 as reported by Kobayashi et al.10,13 At the same time, we noticed profound differences, such as heterogeneous
products, which indicates that the hydride reduction of BaTiO3 is sensitive to the experimental conditions.

3.3 Reduction with NaH, MgH2, NaBH4, and NaAlH4
Hydride reduction of BaTiO3 has hitherto
only been reported with CaH2. In
the following, we describe the reaction with the reductants NaH (MH),
MgH2 (MH2), and NaBH4 and NaAlH4 (MH4). Originally, we also included LiH, LiBH4, and LiAlH4 in this investigation. However, Li-containing
metal hydrides exhibited a different behavior, which not only involved
H but also Li as the reactive species toward the modification of BaTiO3. A detailed investigation of the Li-containing metal hydride
reactions will be reported elsewhere. The decomposition temperatures
of NaH, MgH2, NaBH4, and NaAlH4,
referring to an equilibrium pressure of 1 bar, are in the range 300–400
°C, which is substantially lower than that of CaH2 (∼600 °C).24 Consequently,
one may expect a substantial H2 gas-phase contribution
to hydride reduction. The results are compiled in Table 4, in Figure 7 (TGA traces), and in the Supporting Information (Figure S2, PXRD patterns).

All samples from NaH reductions displayed a pale blue
color, and
the PXRD patterns (Figure S2a) show that
conversion to a cubic product was not achieved. The trend in the lattice
parameters indicates decreased tetragonality with increasing NaH concentration
(Table 4). The TGA
traces (Figure 7a)
reveal a small weight loss up to 350 °C (0.25–0.45%),
which is followed by a slightly irregular behavior up to 700 °C,
above which weights are constant. In Figure 7a included is the TG trace of the starting
material. BaTiO3 exhibited a small (0.15%) weight loss
between room temperature and 740 °C. The continuous nature of
this weight loss indicates gradual release of water, initially physically
adsorbed water on surface hydroxyls and then water from the condensation
of surface hydroxyls. Typically, surface hydroxyls have various bonding
energies and are desorbed over a wide temperature range.25,26 We infer that this small weight loss is also present in metal hydride-reduced
samples. During TGA, this process overlaps with the weight increase
because of oxidation, thus leading to a minor underestimation of the
weight increase. The weight loss of the NaH-reduced samples significantly
exceeds that of the starting material. This suggests that reduction
primarily affected and modified the surface of BaTiO3 particles,
which, after washing, resulted in a higher concentration of hydroxyl
and absorbed water. Note that the TGA weight loss behavior (up to
350 °C) of the NaH-reduced samples and the 1.2-H-CaH2-7d sample appears to be very similar (cf. Figure 6b).

Using MgH2 as the reducing
agent yielded the cubic phase
already with 0.2 H (Figure S2b). The samples
produced with 0.2 H, 0.6 H, and 1.2 H represented single-phase products,
with the lattice parameter increasing from 4.005 to 4.020 Å (Table 4). With 1.8 H, a mixture
of two phases—with lattice parameters 4.020 and 4.033 Å
and roughly equal proportions—was obtained. Generally, the
lattice parameters of the MgH2-reduced samples are larger
compared to that of the CaH2-reduced ones. Also, and perhaps
related, the TGA weight increase (Figure 7b) due to oxidation is larger compared to
that of CaH2-reduced ones. The x value
attained for the 1.8-H-MgH2 sample approaches the maximum
value 0.6 proposed by Kobayashi et al.10 The results for NaAlH4 are shown in Figures 7c and S2c. Similar to MgH2 reduction, a single-phase
cubic product is obtained already with 0.2 H. The samples 0.6-H-NaAlH4, 1.2-H-NaAlH4, and 1.8-H-NaAlH4, however,
represented two phase mixtures. The TGA traces of NaAlH4- and MgH2-reduced samples compare well.

The results
for the NaBH4 reductions are shown in Figures 7d and S2d. The sample 0.2-H-NaBH4 corresponded
to the tetragonal phase, whereas higher synthesis H concentrations
afforded single-phase cubic products. Remarkably, the lattice parameter
of these products shows virtually no dependence on synthesis H concentration
and attains a comparatively small value, 4.005 Å (Table 4). The TGA traces of the NaBH4-reduced samples (Figure 7d) are different from those of the CaH2-,
MgH2-, and NaAlH4-reduced ones, in that the
weight increase is already observed between 200 and 400 °C, that
is, at temperatures about 200 °C lower. In addition, a peculiar
kink near 500 °C is noticeable, which suggests that the oxidation
occurs in two steps. Above 650 °C, the weights are constant and
the total weight increases compare well with the corresponding MgH2- and NaAlH4-reduced samples.

In summary,
NaH acts only as a weak reducing agent toward BaTiO3, which
should relate to the low decomposition temperature
of NaH, possibly making gaseous H2 the reducing species.
We conjecture that reduction with NaH primarily affects and modifies
the surface of BaTiO3 particles. The other metal hydrides
afford cubic products. The TGA weight increase for NaBH4-, MgH2-, and NaAlH4-reduced samples is very
similar, with x values for 1.8 H products being near
to 0.6, which was previously reported as the maximum value for BaTiO3–xHx.10 Judging from the TGA weight increase (x values) of the reduced samples, the reductive reactivity
of CaH2 appears to be lower compared to that of MgH2, NaAlH4, and NaBH4. From the PXRD,
one can notice differences between the cubic products obtained with
the various reductants. Products from NaBH4 reduction are
distinguished in that they are single phase even at the highest H
concentrations applied, whereas the other reductants yield mixtures
of two cubic phases with increasing H concentration. MgH2-reduced samples attain the largest lattice parameters. With respect
to unit cell parameters, one may discern three main scenarios, 4.005
Å—NaBH4, 4.01 Å—CaH2, and 4.02 Å—MgH2. We note that 0.1 HAc as
the washing agent removed effectively the oxides MgO and “NaAlO2”, which is rather difficult when using NH4Cl/MeOH. Using NaBH4 as the reducing agent yielded an
amorphous side product that could not be removed by washing with a
weak acid. The presence of amorphous “NaBO2”
only became apparent when analyzing the samples after TGA. The PXRD
pattern showed extra reflections from BaTi(BO3)2, presumably formed according to 2 NaBO2 + BaTiO3 → BaTi(BO3)2 + Na2O. Perhaps
this reaction also influences the shape of the TG curve and may explain
the peculiar kink feature near 500 °C.

3.4 Solid-State 1H MAS NMR Investigations
1H MAS NMR has
not yet been considered for the detailed
analysis of new BaTiO3–xHx. Kobayashi et al., in their initially report on
BaTiO3–xHx, showed a spectrum with a single sharp signal at 4.4 ppm (the
sample composition was not stated).10 They
concluded that all H species are in the same chemical state and environment,
in agreement with a defect-free solid solution in which O2– is randomly replaced by H– in the perovskite structure.

Figure 8 shows 1H MAS NMR spectra recorded of the starting material before
and after TGA, that is, before and after heating to 900 °C in
air. Three distinct resonances are observed at 1.1, 4.8, and 6.5 ppm,
together with two shoulders at ∼2 and ∼4 ppm, respectively.
All of these proton signals are attributed to the surface OH species;
the presence of structural hydroxyl in the starting material is excluded
because of the great similarity of the spectra before and after TGA.
Unlike surface OH, structural OH will not reform upon exposure to
ambient atmosphere after the TGA treatment. Also, the occurrence of
structural OH is more typical for the hydrothermally synthesized BaTiO3, which are afforded as nanoparticles with cubic symmetry.25−28 These are clearly not the characteristics of our starting material
(cf. Figure 3a). Because
the distinct chemical shifts of 1H resonances stem from
the specific surface environments, the bonding energies associated
with the respective proton sites are also likely to differ, which
is reflected by the continuous weight loss seen in the TG experiment
(cf. Figure 7a).

Figure 8 1H MAS NMR spectrum of the BaTiO3 starting
material before (black line) and after (red line) heating to 900 °C
in air flow (during a TGA experiment).

Figure 9a
shows
the 1H MAS NMR spectra recorded from the 0.2-H-CaH2 and 1.2-H-CaH2 samples. The most noticeable difference
is a broad resonance centered at −18 ppm, with an additional
shoulder at −60 ppm, which appears in the spectrum of the 1.2-H-CaH2 sample and which is absent in the spectrum of 0.2-H-CaH2. We attribute this signal to hydridic H on the O position
in the perovskite structure. This is unambiguously corroborated by
the 2H MAS NMR spectrum of the analogous sample 1.2-D-CaD2, which was prepared in the same way as the 1.2-H-CaH2 specimen (i.e., 2 day synthesis at 600 °C), but with
a deuterated reducing agent. Obviously, the hydroxyl resonances are
absent in the 2H spectrum, which shows a single signal
that exhibits the same chemical shift as the broad resonance in the 1H spectrum (Figure 9b). The 1H MAS NMR signals of 0.2-H-CaH2 and 1.2-H-CaH2 in the (positive) 0–10 ppm range
have a similar pattern (seen in Figure 9c). When compared to the untreated BaTiO3, the CaH2-reduced samples exhibit additional signals
in the 1–7 ppm region and also altered intensities. This indicates
that upon reduction (and subsequent washing), additional surface OH
sites are created, along with a population redistribution of the pre-existing
ones.

Figure 9 (a) 1H MAS NMR spectra of 0.2 and 1.2 H CaH2-reduced samples (600 °C, 2 day synthesis). (b) 2H MAS NMR spectrum of a 1.2 D CaD2-reduced sample (600
°C, 2 day synthesis). The dotted line highlights the identical
location of the maxima of the broad resonances in the 1H and 2H spectra. (c) Close-up of the resonances in the
positive parts per million range. The inset shows integrated proton
signal intensity with respect to the starting material (BaTiO3). The signal of the 1.2-H sample is deconvoluted into a protic
(positive parts per million) and hydridic (negative parts per million)
contribution.

As a next step, we attempted
to quantify the H content of the BaTiO3 starting material
by relating its 1H NMR signal
intensity to that of adamantane (C10H16) in
the same rotor volume and under identical experimental conditions.
The BaTiO3 sample (before TGA) exhibits a total 1H NMR signal integral of 0.94% compared to the adamantane sample.
From the densities and molecular weights of adamantane (1.08 g/cm3, 136.23 g/mol) and BaTiO3 (6.02 g/cm3, 233.2 g/mol), a molar ratio of H/BaTiO3 ≈ 0.039
can then be derived. This ratio relates well to the TGA weight loss
of the BaTiO3 starting material (0.15%, cf. Figure 7b): when attributing this weight
loss to H2O, one obtains a molar ratio H2O/BaTiO3 ≈ 0.02 (i.e., H/BaTiO3 = 0.04). In order
to quantify the H content of the reduced samples, we related their 1H NMR signal integrals to this value. This is demonstrated
in the inset of Figure 9c. In addition, the 1H signals can be deconvoluted into
a protic (positive parts per million) and hydridic (negative parts
per million) part.

Surprisingly, the total 1H NMR
signal integral for 1.2-H-CaH2 is only approximately 5
times larger than that of the 0.2-H-CaH2 sample (which
in turn is only slightly higher than that of
the starting material). From deconvolution of the total 1H NMR signal integral for 1.2-H-CaH2, one can estimate
the molar ratio between hydridic H and BaTiO3 to be approximately
0.16. The large discrepancy with the TGA experiment (cf. Figure 4), which delivers
an x value of 0.24 with respect to BaTiO3–xHx, has to be attributed
to the simultaneous presence of O vacancies. As a matter of fact,
the combined 1H MAS NMR and TGA results suggest that hydridic
H and O vacancies are present in roughly equal concentrations. Thus,
we reformulate 1.2-H-CaH2 as BaTiO3–xHy□(x–y) with x ≈ 0.24 and y ≈ 0.16 and conclude
that 1H MAS NMR spectroscopy represents a reliable and
convenient method to analyze H environments and assess H contents
in reduced BaTiO3 samples.

The observed negative
shift for the hydridic 1H can
be attributed to the contact hyperfine interaction between the 3d
electrons of Ti(III) and the 1H nucleus. This shift mechanism
is operative in both metallic systems and paramagnetic insulators.29,30 In metallic systems, the electrons are delocalized in a conduction
band and the hyperfine interaction results in a Knight shift that
depends on the density of states at the Fermi level.31 The magnitude of the Knight shift is known to increase
with both the unit cell volume32 and the
concentration of charge carriers.33 In
paramagnetic insulators, the shift mechanism is dominated by the Fermi-contact
hyperfine interaction of 1H with the 3d electron of the
directly bonded Ti(III) ion, which gives a Fermi-contact shift.29 In the latter case, the electronic conductivity
is hypothesized to arise from the electron polaron formation between
localized states formed in the band gap. Both mechanisms may give
negative shifts, if the hyperfine interaction is dominated by a spin
polarization mechanism. The identity of the shift mechanism in our
reduced BaTiO3 samples is addressed in the following discussion.

The 1H MAS NMR spectra recorded from the series of 0.2
H-reduced samples are shown in Figure 10. Although surface hydroxyl sites and their
respective populations are altered, one recognizes a general similarity
with the starting material. More interestingly, the spectra of 0.2-H-MgH2 and 0.2-H-NaAlH4 specimens have an additional
resonance at around 0 ppm. As discussed previously, these samples
are cubic, whereas the other 0.2 H-reduced materials remained tetragonal.
We therefore interpret this additional resonance at around 0 ppm as
being from hydridic H. The total 1H signal of the 0.2-H-CaH2 and 0.2-H-NaBH4 samples is similar to that of
the starting material (H/BaTiO3 ≈ 0.04), whereas
that of the remaining samples is by 70–80% higher. For 0.2-H-NaH,
this is clearly due to an increased concentration of surface OH. For
0.2-H-MgH2 and 0.2-H-NaAlH4, the higher 1H concentration is attributed to the hydridic contribution.
This contribution, y, can then be estimated to be
∼0.03, which is slightly lower than the x values
obtained from TGA, 0.04–0.05 (cf. Table 4). The relatively small hydride shifts observed
for 0.2-H-MgH2 and 0.2-H-NaAlH4 compared to
1.2-H-CaH2 may then be consistent with a Knight shift for
all the three samples: 1.2-H-CaH2 has a considerably higher
concentration of hydride and also vacancies and therefore a higher
concentration of charge carriers, which in turn results in a more
negative Knight shift.

Figure 10 1H MAS NMR spectra of the 0.2-H
sample series. The blue
dotted line indicates an additional resonance in the 0.2-H-MgH2 and 0.2-H-NaAlH4 spectra at ∼0 ppm, which
is attributed to hydridic H. The inset shows integrated 1H signal intensity with respect to the starting material (BaTiO3). The violet color for 0.2-H-MgH2 and 0.2-H-NaAlH4 illustrates a mixture of protic and hydridic H.

Figure 11 shows
the 1H MAS NMR spectra recorded for the series of 1.2 H-reduced
samples. First, 1.2-H-NaH, which is tetragonal, does not exhibit a
hydridic component, as expected given the results discussed previously.
However, the spectrum does reveal a high concentration of surface
hydroxyl, with an especially intense resonance at around 1 ppm. This
supports the conjecture that reduction with NaH primarily affects
the surface of the particles: that is, reduction leads to a high concentration
of vacancies at the surface, which subsequently terminate/react into
hydroxyl during the washing process. The spectrum of 1.2-H-NaBH4 has a distinct signal with a small negative shift of −1.8
ppm, which is assigned to hydridic H. Note that the comparatively
low shift is similar to that observed for 0.2-H-MgH2 and
0.2-H-NaAlH4. As already discussed, 1.2-H-CaH2 exhibits a broad resonance with a maximum at around −18 ppm
and with a shoulder at around −60 ppm. The 1H NMR
signals at negative shifts for the 1.2-H-NaAlH4 and 1.2-H-MgH2 samples are even broader with their peak maxima at around
−30 and −60 ppm, respectively. Clearly, among the 1.2-H
reduced samples, 1.2-H-NaBH4 is distinguished because of
its relatively sharp 1H MAS signal, which indicates a homogeneous
coordination environment for H, and low shift. As will be discussed
in the next section, this sample contains a low concentration of hydride, y ≈ 0.04, which is comparable to that of 0.2-H-MgH2 and 0.2-H-NaAlH4.

Figure 11 (a) 1H MAS
NMR spectra of the 1.2-H sample series. (b)
Close-up of the resonances in the positive parts per million range
attributed to protic (surface) H species. Note that the close-up also
contains the signal from hydridic H for 1.2-H-NaBH4, which
is centered at −1.8 ppm.

We now remark on a possible correlation between the shifts
and
line widths of the hydridic 1H resonances, which broaden
according to NaBH4 < CaH2 < NaAlH4 < MgH2 and concurrently shift toward more negative
parts per million values. The shoulder at −60 ppm in the spectrum
for 1.2-H-CaH2 and a pronounced asymmetry of the negative
parts per million signal in the spectrum for 1.2-H-NaAlH4 probably relate to the two-phase nature of these samples. We recall
that both samples constituted two cubic phases with lattice parameters
∼4.01 and ∼4.02 Å and one is tempted to correlate
the shift to the size of the lattice parameter: 4.005 Å—–2
ppm (NaBH4, single phase); 4.01 Å—–20
to −30 ppm (CaH2, NaAlH4, two-phase);
4.02 Å—–60 ppm (MgH2, single phase).
This is corroborated by the 1H MAS NMR spectra from the
samples obtained by 1.2 H CaH2 reduction during 1, 2, 4,
and 7 days (Supporting Information, Figure
S3). The similarity of the 1, 2, and 4 day samples established from
PXRD and TGA (cf. Figure 6) is also reflected in their virtually identical 1H MAS NMR responses. The spectrum of the 7 day sample, however, reveals
a largely asymmetric resonance with the peak maximum at around −50
ppm. Concomitant with the more negative shift of the NMR signal of
hydridic H is an increase of the lattice parameter of the majority
phase from ∼4.01 to ∼4.02 Å (cf. Table 3).

This gradual shifting
of the resonance to more negative shifts
is consistent with the behavior previously observed for metallic hydrides
such as NbHx, where an increase in the
magnitude of the Knight shift correlates with an increasing unit cell
volume.32 This observation suggests that
our reduced 1.2-H samples correspond to metals with delocalized electrons
in a conduction band, as opposed to electron polaron formation, leading
to localized states in the band gap. Thus, the observed 1H shifts are Knight shifts. Values are consistent with the ranges
observed for other metallic hydride materials, which are typically
0 to −250 ppm.34 As mentioned above,
the magnitude of the Knight shift also depends on the density of states
at the Fermi level.31 This in turn should
correlate with the charge carrier concentration, and one would also
expect that the charge carrier concentration in our samples increases
with increasing Knight shift. However, the overall trends are complicated
to predict. Kageyama et al. reported measurable electrical conductivities
for their materials BaTiO2.4H0.6 and BaTiO2.7H0.3, while at the same time their 1H MAS NMR spectrum indicates the absence of the Knight effect.10 This may be explained by assuming a different
electronic structure and conduction mechanism, that is, thermally
activated polaron hopping. However, we note that the 1H
MAS NMR spectrum reported by Kageyama et al. showing a single sharp
resonance at 4.4 ppm is slightly inconceivable because a more complex
spectrum is expected from the simultaneous presence of unavoidable
surface hydroxyl and surface water.

3.5 Oxyhydride
versus O Vacancy Formation
It appears that the hydride reduction
of BaTiO3 is strongly
influenced by the reducing agent (metal hydride) and that reduced
BaTiO3 actually represents complex heterogeneous materials
because of the simultaneous presence of vacancies and H in the anion
substructure. The overall concentration of hydridic H is comparatively
rather low.

Figure 12 presents the results of the 1H MAS NMR spectral
deconvolution into positive(protic)- and negative(hydridic)-parts
per million shift contributions to the total proton signal of 1.2
H-reduced BaTiO3 samples. It is seen that 1.2-H-MgH2 and 1.2-H-NaAlH4 have a very similar hydridic
H content as 1.2-H-CaH2. Surprising is the high H content
of the 1.2-H-NaH sample, which, however, refers to protic (surface)
hydroxyl, and the low hydridic H content (on the order of 0.04) of
1.2-H-NaBH4. This implies that O vacancies dominate in
the NaBH4-reduced sample. Thus, when using the formula
BaTiO3–xHy□(x–y) for hydride-reduced BaTiO3, x as estimated
from TGA is ∼0.35 (cf. Table 4) and y is ∼0.04. Accordingly,
the H–/O vacancy ratio is around 1:10. Analogous
reasoning for the MgH2- and NaAlH4-reduced samples
yields y values similar to the CaH2-reduced
sample (0.14–0.15); however, because of the significantly larger x (around 0.4), O vacancy concentrations for these samples
exceed the concentration of hydridic H by 2–3 times. The compositions
of 1.2-H samples derived from the combined TGA and NMR analysis are
compiled in Table 5.

The formation of O-deficient phases
BaTiO3–xHy□(x–y) is surprising and at
variance with the results of Kobayashi et al.10,13 The question arises whether these phases represent intermediates
toward stoichiometric oxyhydride formation. Bridge et al. pointed
out the significance of gaseous H2 present in the hydride
reduction of LaSrCo3O4 for obtaining LaSrCo3H0.7.18 In addition,
perhaps Kobayashi et al. attained during their synthesis of BaTiO3–xHx—for
unknown reasons—a pressurized H2 atmosphere. Following
this conjecture, we subjected the CaH2-, MgH2-, and NaAlH4-reduced samples to pressurized H2 atmospheres (30–50 bar) at 600 °C, which is the temperature
applied in the preceding hydride reduction. The results are summarized
in Table S1 (Supporting Information) and Figure 13. Interestingly,
during annealing under pressurized H2, the two-phase samples
essentially became single phase, with a lattice parameter closely
corresponding to the previous majority phase (Table S1, cf. Table 2). The 1H NMR spectra (Figure 13) revealed that the annealing procedure
did not lead to an increased hydride content. However, the signal
narrowed significantly, which indicates that more ordered phases BaTiO3–xHy□(x–y) were obtained
(cf. Figure 11a and Supporting Information, part V, where spectra
of post- and prehydrogenated samples are directly compared). Apparent
again is a correlation of the size of the lattice parameter and the
chemical shift of the 1H resonance: the larger the parameter,
the more negative the shift is. The TGA weight increases are by about
20% lower after the annealing procedure. This coincides with a lower
H content of the posthydrogenated samples. The diminished hydridic
H content may be due to a slight oxidation of the sample from traces
of oxygen in the autoclave setup.

In summary, it remains
unclear why our hydride reduction experiments
with BaTiO3 resulted in a different product as described
by Kobayashi et al. Yet, highly O-deficient BaTiO3–xHy□(x–y) is an interesting material.
Reduced BaTiO3–x, with applications
in electroceramics, electrocatalysis, and electronics, has been described
and studied earlier.35 There is general
agreement that the crystal symmetry changes from tetragonal to cubic
for small values of x, x < 0.02,
before transforming to the hexagonal 6H-perovskite for x > 0.02.36,37 The hexagonal form can maintain
a maximum x of about 0.15.38 Characteristic
for all forms O-deficient BaTiO3–x is their blue/black color. Cubic BaTiO3–x is synthesized at temperatures 900–1250 °C in
a flowing mixture of 5% H2/95% N2. Reduction
at higher temperatures results in the hexagonal form.37 Mixtures of tetragonal and cubic BaTiO3–x are also obtained when sintering BaTiO3 in the reducing environment of an SPS apparatus at 1200 °C,39,40 and the hexagonal form can be synthesized when heating tetragonal
BaTiO3 in a graphite-vacuum furnace to 1300–1500
°C.38 Against this background, the
existence of cubic phases BaTiO3–xHy□(x–y) with x values exceeding 0.5 is
surprising. Clearly, the incorporation of H plays an important role
in stabilizing these highly O-deficient variants of BaTiO3, which in contrast to previously reported forms are accessible at
comparatively low temperatures (∼600 °C). The two-phase
behavior observed for most reductions may correlate with a segregation
of BaTiO3–xHy□(x–y) into a vacancy and hydride-rich composition. Interestingly, our
defect samples show a similar reactivity toward the formation of mixed-anion
derivatives as that reported for BaTiO2.5H0.5.12 For example, BaTiO3–xHy□(x–y) can be easily converted
into green-colored nitridized BaTiO3 (BaTiO3−δNy) under a stream of N2 gas
at temperatures above 450 °C.

4 Conclusions
Following previous reports on the reaction of tetragonal BaTiO3 with CaH2 yielding cubic oxyhydrides BaTiO3–xHx,10,13 we investigated hydride reduction of BaTiO3 with various
metal hydrides as reducing agents. At the applied temperature of 600
°C, we find that NaH acts only as a weak reducing agent. A conversion
into a cubic product is not obtained. This is attributed to the low
decomposition temperature of NaH, instead of making H– gaseous H2 the reducing species. Apart from the originally
employed CaH2, also MgH2 and the ternary hydrides
NaBH4 and NaAlH4 reduce BaTiO3 to
a blue-/black-colored cubic product. However, at variance with the
original reports, we find that only a small concentration of H replaces
O in the anionic substructure of BaTiO3. Instead, highly
O-deficient disordered cubic phases BaTiO3–xHy□(x–y) with x up to 0.6
and y in a range 0.04–0.25 are obtained. The
existence of such phases is surprising, and the incorporation of H
supposedly plays an important role in stabilizing these highly O-deficient
variants of BaTiO3. These defective samples show high reactivity
toward the formation of mixed-anion derivatives, such as oxynitrides.
Finally, we emphasize the important role of NMR spectroscopy for characterizing
both H species and H contents in reduced BaTiO3 samples.
The negative shift of hydridic H is attributed to the metallic nature
of the phases BaTiO3–xHy□(x–y).
