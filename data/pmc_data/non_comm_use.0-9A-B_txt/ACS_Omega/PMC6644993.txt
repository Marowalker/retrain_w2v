Herein, a smart strategy
is proposed to tailor unique interwoven
nanocable architecture consisting of MnCoOx nanoparticles embedded in one-dimensional (1D) mesoporous N-doped
carbon nanofibers (NCNFs) by using electrospinning technique. The
as-prepared network mat of N-doped carbon nanofibers with embedded
MnCoOx nanoparticles (MnCoOx@NCNFs) is tested as a current collector-free and
binder-free flexible anode, which eliminates slurry preparation process
during electrode fabrication in the Li-ion battery (LIB). The MnCoOx@NCNFs possess versatile structural characteristics
that can address simultaneously different issues such as poor conductivity,
low cycling stability, volume variation, flexibility, and binder issue
associate with the metal oxide. The free-standing mat electrode shows
not only high initial discharge and charge capacities but also reversible
discharge cycling stability of almost 80% retention up to 100 cycles
and 60% retention up to 500 cycles at 1.0 A/g. Such high Li storage
capacity and excellent cycling stability are attributed to the unique
flexible and free-standing spider network-like architecture of the
1D MnCoOx@NCNFs that provides the platform
for bicontinuous electron/ion pathways for superior electrochemical
performance. Along with excellent electrochemical performance, simple
synthesis procedure of unique binder-free MnCoOx@NCNFs can achieve cost-effective scalable mass production
for practical use in a flexible mode, not merely in LIBs but also
in a wide spectrum of energy storage fields.

Introduction
In modern society,
demand of portable electronic devices is rapidly
increasing; hence, electrochemical storage devices attract great interest
as power systems in the electronic market.1−3 Lithium-ion
battery (LIB) is the most promising candidate as an electrochemical
storage device because of its high energy density and operating voltage.4 Currently, graphite has been used as an anode
material for the commercially available LIB, but it has some limitations
such as low specific capacitance and energy density.5 Therefore, immense efforts have been focused to develop
new anode materials as alternatives to graphite for LIB.6 Nowadays, single and binary transition metal
oxides (TMOs)7,8 and mixed transition metal oxides
(MTMOs)9,10 have attracted tremendous attention of research
community, as they can store a large quantity of Li+ (500–1000
mAh/g) via spatially varied conversion-type reaction mechanisms.11 Among the TMOs, cobalt and manganese have been
extensively used for energy storage because both of them show variable
oxidation states.12 Many researchers are
currently working on engineering the micro/nanostructure of MnCo2O4 and mixed manganese cobalt oxides to overcome
the volume change during Li+ insertion/extraction. For
instance, Li et al. fabricated a quasi-hollow microsphere structure
of MnCo2O4 by tuning the synthesis strategy,
which offered the large surface area and shortened the diffusion length
of ion, to overcome the volume expansion during the charge/discharge.13 Huang et al. developed a core–shell ellipsoidal
MnCo2O4 structure, which showed the initial
discharge capacity of 1433.3 mAh/g at 0.1 A/g.14 Furthermore, a few more microstructures/nanostructures
such as multicomponent assembled MnCo2O4 microspheres,15 and hollow MnCo2O4 submicrospheres
with multilevel interiors to help to buffer the volume variation of
the anode material16 have also been reported.
However, these nanostructured MnCo2O4 materials
suffer from poor electron transfer typical of oxide materials and,
hence, need to combine with conductive carbonaceous materials to manage
the electron transfer issue.

Chen et al. suggested that the
graphene sheet was beneficial for
the transportation of ions/electrons during battery operation in MnCo2O4/graphene sheet composite.17 Likewise, Wang et al. demonstrated the synthesis of one-dimensional
(1D) CoMnOx/N-CNT composite by binding
Mn–Co particles on nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes (N-CNTs)
through solvothermal method.18 Moreover,
Yun et al. synthesized MnCo2O4 microspheres
with a uniform surface coating of conductive carbon layer to enhance
the electrochemical performance of MnCo2O4 microspheres.19 However, these works need proper slurry preparation,
which requires adequate combination of active material, binder, conductive
additive, and solvent for optimization of the electrode in terms of
specific capacity and cycle life in Li-ion battery, as illustrated
by Kraytsberg et al.20 Bhattacharjya et
al. also demonstrated the effect of polymeric binder not only on the
high specific capacity but also on the rate and cycling stability.21 Currently, all of the commercial LIB electrodes
utilize polymer binder. Although when used at an appropriate concentration
in the electrode formulation, the binder is not that detrimental to
the battery’s energy density, the use of polymeric binder bothers
the electrical conductivity of active material and its utility as
an anode material in addition to extra cost for the binder in a LIB.
To overcome the barrier of binder, Li et al. demonstrated the growth
of one-dimensional MnCo2O4 nanowires on a nickel
foam as a binder-free anode material for LIB, and Hou et al. reported
a three-dimensional hierarchical MnCo2O4 nanosheet
array on a carbon cloth.22,23 Even though these types
of electrode materials show good electrochemical performance, they
still have the deficiency of simultaneous electron and ion conduction
pathways and scalable mass production. Wei et al. illustrated the
concept of simultaneous electron and ion conduction pathways for hierarchical
lithium vanadium phosphate/carbon mesoporous nanowires, even though
polymeric binder and conductive additives were used for the fabrication
of coin cell.24 Furthermore, Yang et al.
used the lithium vanadium phosphate on the carbon nanofiber (CNF)
as a high-performance cathode material.25 Similarly, CNF,26 MnO/CNF,27 FeCO3/CNF,28 and Mn3O4-MnO/CNF29 have also been studied as flexible anode materials for Li-ion batteries.

Herein, we report a first in situ synthesis of uniformly distributed
MnCoOx nanoparticles encapsulated in a
N-doped carbon nanofiber (NCNF) by using the electrospinning technique.
In particular, a smart strategy is developed to fabricate a free-standing
interwoven spider network architecture of unique one-dimensional (1D)
NCNFs with embedded MnCoOx nanoparticles
(MnCoOx@NCNFs) and thus to enable binder-free
and slurry preparation-free formulation process of the MnCoOx@NCNF electrode. The MnCoOx@NCNF electrode is found to effectively shorten Li+ ion diffusion, relieve volume change, and provide effective electron
conduction pathways during the lithiation/delithiation process of
the metal oxide, which can greatly improve the electrochemical performance
of the cell.

Results and Discussion
The as-prepared
composite contains MnCoOx nanoparticles
embedded in mesoporous N-doped carbon nanofibers (MnCoOx@NCNFs) by using the electrospinning technique.
The steps involved in the material synthesis are shown in Figure 1a. At the initial
stage, polyacrylonitrile (PAN)/dimethylformamide (DMF) solution along
with metal precursors undergoes electrospinning process to get Mn–Co–PAN
fiber composite. Further, the electrospun Mn–Co–PAN
fiber is initially calcined at 250 °C for 1 h and then at rising
temperature up to 700 °C for 1 h under N2 flows. During
the calcination process, acetate groups from Mn and Co convert into
CO2 and other gases, and PAN also decomposes to become
carbon framework and produce NH3. Because of the evolution
of CO2, NH3, and other gases, mesosize pores
were created on the carbon fiber backbone. Moreover, in the inert
atmosphere, the cyclic structure of PAN polymer gets opened and transformed
into the carbon chain. These carbon chains further arranged themselves
to form a graphitic carbon encapsulating the MnCoOx nanoparticles in the carbon fiber framework.30 Metal oxide-free N-doped CNFs (NCNFs) were also
synthesized in the same way as that of MnCoOx@NCNF process without the addition of Mn-acetate and Co-acetate sources.
Because there is no metal precursor, no visible pores are formed on
the surface of NCNF. The as-prepared MnCoOx@NCNF film mat as well as the NCNF film shows excellent flexibility,
as shown in Movie S1 (Supporting Information),
and hence can be directly used as a current collector/binder-free
anode material in LIBs.

Figure 1 Schematic illustration of (a) preparation of
MnCoOx@NCNF composite by electrospinning
and carbonization
processes, and (b) interwoven spider network architecture of MnCoOx@NCNF composite with bicontinuous electron/ion
transport pathways.

Thermogravimetric analysis
(TGA) is carried out to confirm the
exact amount of MnCoOx in the composite
and indicates the presence of 66 wt % metal oxide, as shown in Figure S1 (Supporting Information). Therefore,
the as-prepared interwoven spider network architecture of MnCoOx@NCNFs possesses proper amount of MnCoOx and NCNF. The MnCoOx@NCNF composite can address simultaneously different issues such
as poor conductivity, low cycling stability, volume variation, and
flexibility of the metal oxide, as well as troublesome binder issue.
In addition, it provides unique bicontinuous electron/ion transport
pathways for superior electrochemical performance, as illustrated
in Figure 1b, which
is attributed to the synergistic effect of MnCoOx nanoparticles and porous NCNFs. This will be considered
more in the following discussion.

The X-ray diffraction (XRD)
patterns of MnCoOx@NCNF composite match
well with the mix phases of MnCo2O4.5 and MnO
in accordance with JCPDS No. [00-032-0297]
and [01-07-0257], respectively, as shown in Figure 2a. Because the MnCoOx@NCNF composite shows the mixture phase peaks of MnO and MnCo2O4.5, all of the peaks of MnO and MnCo2O4.5 may not be observable in the XRD spectrum due to
their low crystallinity and co-interference. A broad peak at 20°
in both the MnCoOx@NCNF and NCNF materials
is ascribed to the graphitic carbon. The nitrogen adsorption–desorption
study of MnCoOx@NCNFs reveals the type
II/IV isotherms in Figure 2b. The specific surface area (SSA) of MnCoOx@NCNFs is observed to be 94 m2/g, whereas NCNFs
show a low SSA of 9.0 m2/g, with no obvious isotherm type.
As shown in the inset of Figure 2b, the as-prepared MnCoOx@NCNF material shows two kinds of mesopores (with maximum at 3 and
9 nm), which can assist in the fast diffusion of Li ions.

NCNF samples, (b) N2 adsorption isotherm of MnCoOx@NCNFs, (c) X-ray photoelectron survey spectra
of MnCoOx@NCNF and NCNF samples, and deconvoluted
X-ray photoelectron spectra of (d) Mn 2p, (e) Co 2p, and (f) O 1s
for MnCoOx@NCNF and NCNF samples.

Furthermore, X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was
also carried out to understand the valance states of Mn and Co in
the MnCoOx@NCNFs. The survey spectrum
of the pure NCNFs shows the C, N, and O peaks, whereas the MnCoOx@NCNF composite clearly points out the presence
of additional peaks of Mn and Co in Figure 2c. By using a Gaussian fitting method, Mn
2p spectrum features two main spin–orbit lines of Mn 2p3/2 at 641.01 and Mn 2p1/2 at 652.77 eV with separation
of 11.76 eV (Figure 2d). After precise fitting, the spectrum is deconvoluted into peaks
at 641.01 and 652.77 eV, which correspond to the existence of Mn(II)
and peaks at 642.46 and 654.40 eV, the characteristic peaks of Mn(III)
cation.31 The Co 2p X-ray photoelectron
spectrum of MnCoOx@NCNFs also demonstrates
two characteristics peaks at 780.5 and 796.6 eV, corresponding to
the Co 2p3/2 and Co 2p1/2 spin–orbit
peaks, whereas prominent satellite peaks at 786.2 and 802.8 eV in
the Co 2p spectrum confirm the co-presence of Co2+ and
Co3+ (Figure 2e).32 The deconvoluted O 1s spectrum in Figure 2f exhibits the photoelectron
peaks at 530.11 eV, which certify the metal–oxygen bond and
the presence of oxygen in the spinel structure lattice. In particular,
additional peaks at 531.18 and 533.07 eV are ascribed to organic C–O
and C=O.33 Meanwhile, the O 1s peaks
for metal oxide-free NCNF are deconvoluted into four peaks 531.16,
532.1, 533.1, and 533.8 eV. Furthermore, C 1s and N 1s X-ray photoelectron
spectra of MnCoOx@NCNF and NCNF samples
are shown in Figure S2 (Supporting Information).

The morphology and microstructure of the as-prepared NCNFs and
MnCoOx@NCNFs show the interwoven nanocable
architecture, as seen in Figure 3a,b. Figure 3a,c clearly shows the formation of fiber with uniform diameter
and smooth surface of pristine NCNF without any visible pores on its
surface, in accordance with its low surface area. On the other hand, Figure 3b,d shows the nanoparticles
(less than 30 nm) of MnCoOx consistently
embedded in the NCNF, as well as the mesopores with ∼25 nm
in size on the backbone of the NCNF of MnCoOx@NCNFs, which can be attributed to the evolution of CO2, NH3, and other gases during the carbonization of as-electrospun
Mn–Co–PAN fibers (Figure 3d). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of
the metal oxide-free NCNFs in Figure 4a also justify the smooth surface without any visible
pores and nanoparticles, whereas MnCoOx@NCNFs shown in Figure 4b authenticate the presence of MnCoOx nanoparticles, which are homogeneously embedded in the NCNFs, in
accordance with the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images in Figure 3. In particular,
it is enthralling to notice that in Figures 3 and 4a,b, the diameter
(∼700 nm in size) of MnCoOx@NCNF
is much bigger than that of pure NCNFs (∼300–350 nm
in size), although both were prepared in identical electrospinning
conditions. The larger diameter of MnCoOx@NCNF may be ascribed to the embedded MnCoOx nanoparticles and pores developed in the NCNF framework. In addition,
the high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) images (Figure 4c,d) clearly exhibit the ubiquitous dispersion
of MnCoOx particles and the formation
of graphitic carbon layers in the MnCoOx@NCNFs, which are beneficial for the conduction of electron/ion during
the electrochemical study. Moreover, elemental mapping shown in Figure S3 (Supporting Information) confirms the
uniform distribution of Mn, Co, C, N, and O in the as-prepared MnCoOx@NCNF.

Slurry preparation needs extra works including troublesome
polymeric
binder during electrode fabrication, which restricts the kinetics
of ions, electron transport, and long-term cycling/retention stability
of electrode material and hence becomes a cause of deterioration in
the LIB performance.

In this work, the as-prepared unique spider
network mats of MnCoOx@NCNFs and NCNFs
were investigated as free-standing
anode materials in a Li-ion half-cell, which eliminate slurry preparation
process during electrode fabrication in LIB. To investigate the redox
properties of the as-prepared MnCoOx@NCNF
and NCNF mat electrodes, cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves were measured
between 0.01 and 3.00 V at a scan rate of 0.1 mV/s. The representative
CV curves of the binder-free MnCoOx@NCNF
electrode during the first five cycles are shown in Figure 5a. It is observed that during
the first cycle, three reduction peaks can be identified in the cathodic
sweep. A broad peak centered at 0.97 V corresponds to the initial
reduction of Mn2+ to Mn1+ and Co3.5+ to Co1.5+.34 The proposed
reaction mechanism for the reduction of Mn and Co is shown as follows
(eq 1). 1  The other two
reduction peaks at 0.66 and
0.53 V (Figure 5a)
are associated with the reversible reactions between Li, MnO0.5, and CoO0.75 species, as seen in eqs 3 and 4. 2   3   4  Besides, another
extra sharp cathodic peak
is obtained at 0.16 V, which corresponds to the complete irreversible
reduction reaction (eq 2) of Mn2+ to Mn0 and the formation of a solid
electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer.35,36 This may also
prove the presence of the extra MnO crystal along with the MnCo2O4.5 in the as-synthesized MnCoOx@NCNF material, as shown in the XRD signal in Figure 2a. In the anodic sweep, two
broad peaks were observed at 1.29 and 2.05 V (vs Li/Li+), which are assigned to the reoxidation of Mn0 to Mn1+ and Co0 to Co1.5+, respectively, as
seen in eqs 3 and 4. Later, from the second cycle onward, two pairs
of redox couples at 0.33/1.29 V and 0.47/2.05 V are observed with
stable peak positions, suggesting that the highly reversible conversion
reactions start to dominate the Li+ storage process.

curves at a current density of 100 mA/g for the first five cycles
of MnCoOx@NCNF and NCNF mat electrodes,
respectively, (e) rate capability at different current densities,
and (f) cyclic stability at a current density of 1.0 A/g of MnCoOx@NCNF and NCNF mat electrodes, respectively.

To pursue eqs 1–4, ex situ XRD measurements
were performed for charging and discharging tests at different voltages
of MnCoOx@NCNF coin cell in Figure S4 (Supporting Information). Small XRD
peaks corresponding to MnO, CoO, and Li2O, as well as metallic
Mn and Co, were observed for the respective potentials, confirming
the interaction of Li+ ion with MnCoOx particles in MnCoOx@NCNF electrode.
In the case of NCNF electrode, a strong peak at 0.56 V is observed
in the first cycle and vanishes in the second cycle, as illustrated
in Figure 5b, indicating
the formation of the SEI film on the surface of NCNFs.37,38 The discharge–charge characteristic curves of the MnCoOx@NCNF electrode at a current density of 100
mA/g in the potential range of 0.01–3.00 V (vs Li+/Li) are shown in Figure 5c. The discharge and charge capacities of the electrode material
in first cycle were found to be 1103 and 610 mAh/g. The irreversible
loss of capacity is attributed to the formation of protecting SEI
film during the first discharge step. In the subsequent discharge/charge
curves, reversible discharge/charge capacities acquired are 608 and
597 mAh/g, respectively, with a stable electrochemical behavior of
the MnCoOx@NCNF electrode. On the other
hand, the NCNF electrode in Figure 5d shows the initial discharge and charge capacities
of 637 mAh/g and 455 mAh/g, respectively, clearly indicating that
the reversible discharge and charge capacities observed for MnCoOx@NCNFs are higher than those for NCNFs.

Areal and volumetric capacities are also critical for practical
battery applications and were measured with loading amount and density
of the electrode materials. Discharge and charge areal capacities
of the first five cycles of MnCoOx@NCNF
and NCNF mat electrodes were calculated and shown in Figure S5 (Supporting Information). To examine the volumetric
capacity of the as-prepared MnCoOx@NCNF
and NCNF electrodes, the thickness of the electrode was measured before
coin cell assembly by the cross-sectional SEM images shown in Figure S6 (Supporting Information), and related
calculation is also shown in the Supporting Information. The areal and volumetric capacities determined for the first cycle
were calculated to be 3.96 mAh/cm2 and 162.2 mAh/cm3 for discharge and 2.18 mAh/cm2 and 89.7 mAh/cm3 for charge, respectively, for MnCoOx@NCNF electrode. By comparison, the corresponding areal and volumetric
capacities for the first cycle of the pure NCNF electrode were determined
to be 1.40 mAh/cm2 and 61.18 mAh/cm3 for discharge
and 1.00 mAh/cm2 and 43.7 mAh/cm3 for charge,
respectively. These results further support the results for specific
capacities in Figure 5 and clearly demonstrate the importance of the active MnCoOx nanoparticles for enhanced electrochemical
performance in MnCoOx@NCNF electrode.

Additionally, Figure 5e represents the rate capability of each of MnCoOx@NCNF and NCNF electrodes. Initially, MnCoOx@NCNF electrode was cycled at 100 mA/g. The capacity
was stabilized at 609 mAh/g after 10 cycles, which is already almost
2 times higher than that of the metal oxide-free NCNF electrode. Then,
the current density for MnCoOx@NCNF electrode
was stepwise increased to 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 800, and 1000 mA/g,
and the average discharge capacities of 537, 495, 475, 455, 440, 390,
and 335 mAh/g, respectively, were obtained after 10 cycles at each
of these current densities. Interestingly, when the current density
finally returns to its original value of 100 mA/g after 80 cycles,
the capacity is returned and further increased to 680 mAh/g. This
exceptionally high rate capability is due to the presence of MnCoOx nanoparticles embedded into the NCNF framework
and the free-standing spider network architecture mat of 1D MnCoOx@NCNF nanocables. This unique free-standing
spider network mat structure facilitates the movement of electrons
generated from the conversion-type reaction between MnCoOx and Li+. In addition, the mesosize pores on the MnCoOx@NCNF backbone allocate the platform for a fast
diffusion of Li+ ion during discharge/charge. The rate
capability of NCNF electrode follows the same trends as that of MnCoOx@NCNF electrode, but the capacity values are
much less, which confirms that the ubiquity of MnCoOx nanoparticles and mesopores helps to enhance the capacity
of MnCoOx@NCNF electrode.

Furthermore,
the Li+ diffusion constant was calculated
for MnCoOx@NCNF anode material by Randles
Sevchik in eq 5.39 For the Li+ ion diffusion coefficient,
cyclic voltammograms of variation scan rates were performed for MnCoOx@NCNF electrode (Figure S7a, Supporting Information). 5  where Ip is the
peak current, n is the number of electrons, S is the active surface area of the electrode, C0 is the concentration of Li ion, D is
the diffusion coefficient, and ϑ is the scan rate. From the
slope of linear fitting line for peak intensity of A (see Figure S7b, Supporting Information),
the diffusion coefficients of MnCoOx@NCNF
were determined to be 1.008 × 10–6 and 2.7
× 10–6 cm2/s for oxidative and reductive
peak currents, respectively.

To examine the practical application
of electrode, the cyclic stability
of each of MnCoOx@NCNF and NCNF electrodes
was performed at the current density of 1.0 A/g for 500 cycles, as
shown in Figure 5f.
The MnCoOx@NCNF electrode shows the initial
discharging capacity of 898 mAh/g and the second discharge capacity
of 428 mAh/g at 1.0 A/g, which corresponds to 52% loss in the initial
capacity. From the second cycle onward, the discharging capacity shows
an almost 80% retention for 100 cycles and 60% retention for 500 cycles
(Figure 5f).

To investigate the volume expansion of the as-prepared MnCoOx@NCNFs during cycling test, scanning electron
microscopy (SEM) was employed after different number of cycles. It
is clearly observed that very thin layer was deposited on the surface
of the NCNFs after 1 and 10 cycles (Figure 6a,b) compared to the initial diameter (∼700
nm) of the MnCoOx@NCNFs before cycling.
The diameter increases to ∼800 nm after 10 cycles, which corresponds
to 100 nm increment compared to that before cycling. When the cycle
number increases further from 10 to 100–500 cycles (Figure 6c,d), the diameter
of the MnCoOx@NCNFs also increased to
∼1000 nm, which may be ascribed to the volume expansion of
MnCoOx particles and the formation of
thick layer of SEI film. Interestingly, 50–100 nm thick layer
of particle-like aggregation over the NCNFs is observed and can be
attributed to the formation of SEI film. By comparison, similar type
of layer formation also occurs on the metal oxide-free NCNFs after
different number of cycles at 1.0 A/g, as shown in Figure S8, Supporting Information.

Figure 6 SEM images after (a)
1, (b) 10, (c) 100, and (d) 500 cycling performance

A/g.

Electrochemical activity of the
present nanostructured MnCoOx@NCNF electrode
was accessed by comparing with
other similar Mn–Co metal oxide electrodes as presented in Table S1 (Supporting Information). Although it
is not possible to make a fair comparison due to different experimental
conditions, in general, the current MnCoOx@NCNF network demonstrates a higher capacity and a more stable cycle
and rate capability in addition to a much simpler electrode design
with no current collector and binder. It is attributed to the unique
spider network architecture of MnCoOx@NCNFs
and mesopores on the backbone of the fiber.

To further clarify
the electrochemical performance of the as-prepared
materials, alternating current impedance measurements (Figure S9, Supporting Information) were performed
on the MnCoOx@NCNF and NCNF electrodes.
The Nyquist plots were obtained in freshly prepared coin cell in the
frequency range from 100 kHz to 10 mHz. The intercept on the Z real axis in the high-frequency region represents the
resistance of electrolyte (Rs) and the
diameter of the semicircle indicates the charge transfer resistance
(Rct), relating to the charge transfer
through the active materials and electrolyte.40 The vertical line in the low-frequency region indicates Warburg
impedance (ZW), which is related to the
diffusion of Li+ in the electrode.41,42 The diameter of the semicircle for MnCoOx@NCNF electrode is smaller than that of the NCNF electrode, suggesting
the charge transfer is faster for the former probably because of the
presence of mesopores and MnCoOx nanoparticles
on the MnCoOx@NCNF electrode.43−45

Bicontinuous electron/ion transport pathway mechanism is proposed
as shown in Figure 1b. As a proof of the concept, the as-prepared MnCoOx@NCNF composite shows superior anode electrochemical properties
compared to pristine MnCoOx-free NCNF
electrode. It is because MnCoOx crystals
in the MnCoOx@NCNF composite enhance the
interaction with Li+ ion and follow the conversion-type
reactions as illustrated in eqs 1–4. During the conversion reactions,
the generated electrons are easily transported through the 1D conducting
NCNF scaffold, and the presence of mesopores on the surface provides
effective pathways for rapid Li+ ion diffusion. Thus, this
bicontinuous electron/ion pathway mechanism is achievable as a result
of unique free-standing spider network architecture of MnCoOx@NCNFs and found to be in good agreement with
their superior electrochemical performance.

Conclusions
In
conclusion, this current work is considered to clearly demonstrate
the following key points.1. MnCoOx particles
are in situ encapsulated in mesoporous N-doped carbon nanofiber without
disturbing the flexibility of the NCNFs.

2. As-prepared flexible interwoven nanocable
architecture of 1D MnCoOx@NCNFs is tested
as a free-standing current collector/binder-free anode material for
Li-ion battery, which can eliminate slurry preparation process during
electrode fabrication in LIB.

3. For conversion-type lithiation/delithiation
processes, the unique binder-free MnCoOx@NCNFs boast of excellent level of cyclic stability with high specific
capacity.

4. The unique
spider network architecture
of MnCoOx@NCNFs assists to effectively
shorten Li+ ion diffusion, provide effective electron conduction pathways,
and buffer the volume variation during lithiation/delithiation processes.

5. The as-prepared unique
MnCoOx@NCNF network pursues the bicontinuous
electron/ion
pathway mechanism, enabling enhanced electrochemical performance.

6. Synthesis process of MnCoOx@NCNFs is very simple and cost-effective, along
with
scalable production for practical use in flexible mode, not merely
in LIBs but also in a wide spectrum of energy storage fields.



Therefore, the as-prepared MnCoOx@NCNF
network was able to address simultaneously several different kinds
of issues such as poor conductivity, low cycling stability, flexibility,
volume variation of the metal oxides, and slurry preparation during
electrode formulation. The bicontinuous electron/ion transport pathway
mechanism will promote further academic research, whereas the scalable
production of flexible interwoven architectures of unique MnCoOx@NCNFs will gain spotlight in the industry.
This type of free-standing MnCoOx@NCNF
network will pave a new direction in the fabrication of current collector/binder-free
flexible electrodes in battery and supercapacitor.

70 °C and stirred for 4 h. Mn(Ac2)·2H2O (2 mmol) and Co(Ac)2·4H2O (4 mmol) were
mixed together, and the mixture was added slowly to the as-prepared
PAN solution with vigorous mechanical stirring at 70 °C. The
whole mixture was then stirred for another 4 h to get the precursor
solution for electrospun. The precursor solution was loaded into a
plastic syringe equipped with 23 gauge stainless needle. The 8 mL
of solution was electrospun onto a drum collector covered with aluminum
foil. The distance between the tip and the collector was kept constant
at 18 cm, and the rotation of the drum was maintained at 500 rpm during
the electrospinning process. The electrospinning process was carried
out at an applied voltage of 16 kV, with a feeding speed of 1 mL/h.
The electrospun Mn–Co–PAN fiber film was peel off from
Al foil and further stabilized and carbonized according to programmed
processes at 250 and 700 °C in N2 atmosphere to get
MnCoOx nanoparticles embedded into the
N-doped porous CNFs (MnCoOx@NCNFs).

Material Characterization
Structural property of the
as-prepared materials was examined by X-ray diffraction (XRD) using
Rigaku Smartlab and PANalytical diffractometer. The spectra were recorded
at a scan rate of 3°/min with a Cu Kα target (λ =
0.15406 nm) using a Ni β-filter operating at voltages of 40
and 45 kV and tube currents of 15 and 40 mA. Scanning electron microscopy
(SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and high-resolution
TEM (HRTEM) images were recorded to obtain the information on the
surface morphologies of the as-prepared materials. The SEM images
were obtained using a Hitachi S-4700 microscope operated at an acceleration
voltage of 10 kV. TEM and HRTEM images were collected on HF-3300 (Hitachi
Ltd., Japan) microscope operated at an acceleration voltage of 300
kV at the center for core research facility (CCRF) in DGIST. Elemental
mappings were performed on a scanning transmission electron microscope
(STEM) operated at 300 kV. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)
analyses were carried out with AXIS–NOVA (Kratos) X-ray photoelectron
spectrometer using monochromator Al Kα X-ray source (hυ = 1486.6 eV) operated at 150 W under base pressure
of 2.6 × 10–9 Torr. The nitrogen adsorption–desorption
isotherms were measured at −196 °C using a Micromeritics
ASAP 2020 system. Specific surface areas of the samples were determined
by nitrogen adsorption data in the relative pressure range from 0.05
to 0.2 using the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) equation.
Total pore volume was determined from the amount of gas adsorbed at
the relative pressure of 0.99.

Electrochemical Characterization
The electrochemical
measurements of the as-prepared MnCoOx@NCNF and NCNF mat electrodes were executed through CR2032 coin-type
test cell (Hohsen Corporation, Japan). In coin cell fabrication, Li
metal foil (99.9% purity and 150 μm thickness), 1.0 M LiPF6 in ethylene carbonate/dimethyl carbonate (1:1 in volume),
and microporous polypropylene sheet (Celgard, 2400) were used as counter/reference
electrode, electrolyte, and separator, respectively. The as-prepared
MnCoOx@NCNF and NCNF mat materials were
punched into a circular shape with 14 mm diameter, and the circular-shaped
material can be directly used as the anode without using a current
collector and adding any conductive agent or binder materials, i.e.,
as a free-standing anode material. The punched MnCoOx@NCNF and NCNF circular materials with 14 mm diameter possess
areal loadings of about 3.5–3.6 mg/cm2 and 2.2–2.3
mg/cm2, respectively. To remove moisture, the as-prepared
materials were dried in a vacuum oven at 60 °C overnight. The
vacuum-dried material was assembled into a CR2032 coin-type cell in
an argon-filled glovebox. The cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves of the
cells were recorded on a biologic electrochemical workstation (Biologic
VSP). All of the CVs were carried out with a scan rate of 0.1 mV/s,
over the potential range of 0.01–3.00 V. On the other hand,
the charge–discharge behaviors of the cells were characterized
by BaSyTech multichannel battery test system at room temperature at
various current densities between the potential range of 0.01 and
3.00 V.
