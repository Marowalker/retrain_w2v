There are various
ways of immobilizing carbonic anhydrase (CA)
on solid materials. One of the final aims is to apply immobilized
CA for the catalytic hydration of carbon dioxide (CO2)
as a first step in the conversion of gaseous CO2 into solid
products. The immobilization method investigated allows a straightforward,
stable, and quantifiable immobilization of bovine erythrocyte carbonic
anhydrase (BCA) on silicate surfaces. The method is based on the use
of a water-soluble, polycationic second-generation dendronized polymer
with on average 1000 repeating units, abbreviated as de-PG21000. Several copies of BCA were first covalently
linked to de-PG21000 through stable bisaryl
hydrazone (BAH) bonds. Then, the de-PG21000-BAH-BCA conjugates obtained were adsorbed noncovalently either on
microscopy glass coverslips, inside glass micropipettes, or in porous
glass fiber filters. The apparent density of the immobilized BCA on
the glass surfaces was about 8–10 pmol/cm2. In all
three cases, the immobilized enzyme was highly active and stable when
tested with p-nitrophenyl acetate as a model enzyme
substrate at room temperature. The micropipettes and the glass fiber
filters were applied as flow-through systems for continuous operation
at room temperature. In the case of the glass fiber filters, the filters
were placed inside a homemade flow-through filter holder which allows
flow-through runs with more than one filter connected in series. This
offers the opportunity of increasing the substrate conversion by increasing
the number of BCA-containing filters.

1 Introduction
Carbonic
anhydrase (CA) is a metalloenzyme which is ubiquitously
present in the tissues of animals and plants as well as in bacteria.1,2 Although there are multiple forms of CA, such as α-, β-,
and γ-CA, which differ in their primary structures, the functional
importance of CA is the same for the diverse living systems.2 This is because CA reversibly catalyzes a biologically
critical reaction, namely, between carbon dioxide and water, to yield
bicarbonate and hydronium ions, CO2(g) + 2H2O(l) → HCO3–(aq) + H3O+(aq).3 This CA-catalyzed
reaction is the first step of the biological fixation of atmospheric
carbon into organic compounds, occurring in vivo within
carboxysomes.4 Furthermore, it is essential
for the removal of carbon dioxide from animal tissues.3,5 Among the various forms of CA, α-CA is the best characterized
form. It is a monomeric protein with a zinc ion coordinated by three
histidine residues at the active site.2 α-CA is structurally robust,2 easily
quantifiable on the basis of its esterase activity,6 and commercially available, which are advantageous features
if one considers practical applications of CA-catalyzed reactions.
Since controlling the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide
at a global scale is an important issue,7 various approaches were reported concerning the efficient capturing
and sequestration of carbon dioxide under mild conditions with the
help of α-CA.8−11

Apart from the carrier-free immobilization of CA,12,13 there are several reports on carrier-dependent CA immobilization.13−24 Stable immobilization of CA on a solid carrier material (“support”)
is essential for the development of economical and scalable systems
for capturing carbon dioxide with a continuous reactor or a batch
process in which CA can be recycled. In a number of previous studies
it was shown that α-CA molecules can be immobilized on solid
materials through covalent or noncovalent bonding. For this carrier-dependent
enzyme immobilization, porous silica particles are often used,14−16 partly because the particles possess pores which are large enough
for entrapping the CA molecules. Moreover, the silica surface can
be modified with functional groups for a covalent bonding of the enzyme.
In other approaches, CA was immobilized covalently to other solid
or soft colloidal materials, such as polyurethane foams,17 graphite rods,14 iron
filings,18 and phospholipid vesicles.19 For the noncovalent immobilization, biospecific20 or electrostatic21,22 interactions
between the support material and the CA molecules were utilized. CA
immobilization via electrostatic interactions was demonstrated by
using the layer-by-layer deposition of polyelectrolytes21 and with inner surface-modified mesoporous silica.22 However, the direct noncovalent immobilization
of CA under retention of the activity of the enzyme is not straightforward
due to a homogeneous distribution of positive and negative charges
on the enzyme surface.22 Therefore, the
orientation and conformation of CA on charged solid surfaces were
investigated23,24 since both, conformation and
orientation, are of general significance for the catalytic performance
of immobilized enzymes.25

In the
work presented, α-CA was immobilized on silicate surfaces
via simple adsorption of conjugates consisting of a polycationic dendronized
polymer (denpol)26 to which CA molecules
were first covalently bound through bisaryl hydrazone (BAH) bonds.27,28 With this methodology, horseradish peroxidase (HRP),29 glucose oxidase (GOD),29 and proteinase K (proK)30,31 could be immobilized
successfully on the inner surface of glass micropipettes for using
them as continuous-flow reactors.29,30 For each enzyme,
the optimal conditions for the formation of the denpol–enzyme
conjugate and for the adsorption step had to be elaborated. We used
CA from bovine erythrocytes (Mr ≈
29 000, pI = 5.9),2,32 abbreviated as BCA.
It was conjugated to the deprotected (de) second-generation
dendronized polymer de-PG2 through the mentioned
BAH bonds yielding different denpol-BAH-BCA conjugates, abbreviated
as de-PG2-BAH-BCA (Figure 1). The denpol used had a number-average degree
of polymerization of n = 1000, and the experimentally
determined average number of BCA molecules per denpol chain was between
100 and about 300. Then, the conjugates were immobilized (i) onto
glass coverslips, (ii) inside glass micropipettes of different sizes,
and (iii) in glass fiber filters (Figure 1) through noncovalent interactions between
the conjugates and the supports. The immobilization was carried out
at different pH values below and above the pI value of BCA. In some
experiments, the silicate surface was first precoated with de-PG2 before adsorption of de-PG2-BAH-BCA.
The flow-through catalytic hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl
acetate as a model substrate of BCA was performed with glass micropipettes
and glass fiber filters containing immobilized conjugates in order
to clarify the influence of the reactor type on the efficiency of
the catalyzed reaction. With the glass micropipettes and the glass
fiber filters, the operational stability of the immobilized enzyme
was also determined in simple flow reactor systems.

Figure 1 Schematic illustration
of (a) the deprotected second-generation
dendronized polymer (denpol) de-PG2 to which bovine
erythrocyte carbonic anhydrase (BCA) molecules are bound along the
polymer chain via bisaryl hydrazone (BAH) linker units (de-PG2-BAH-BCA). The chemical structure of one repeating unit (r.u.)
carrying one BCA molecule is shown: n = 1000 for
the denpol used in this work. Schematic drawings of the various silicate
glass supports which were used for the immobilization of de-PG2-BAH-BCA are shown in (b)–(e): (b) glass coverslip, (c)
porous glass fiber filter, and (d, e) two different glass micropipettes.
At the pH used in the work (pH = 7.2 and 5.0), the free amino groups
of de-PG2-BAH-BCA are expected to be positively charged.31 The image of the three-dimensional structure
of BCA with an incorporated zinc ion (red ball) was taken from the
Protein Data Bank Japan, PDBj (PDB code 1V9E).32 In the
illustration (a), Lys35 of the BCA molecule is assumed to be modified
and linked to the de-PG2 molecule.

Although it was shown in this work that the preparation
of the
conjugates and their immobilization on different silicate surfaces
are highly reproducible and the results obtained are positive, the details of preparation and analysis are very important.
This is why we try to provide all necessary information so that the
same reactions and characterizations can also be performed in other
laboratories.

2 Materials and Methods
2.1 Carbonic Anhydrase, Dendronized Polymer, and
Other Chemicals
Carbonic anhydrase from bovine erythrocytes
(BCA, EC 4.2.1.1, catalog number C2624, lot #SLBL1750 V and lot #SLBR4228
V) was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (ε280 = 56 000
M–1·cm–1).33 The deprotected dendronized polymer (de-PG2, number-average degree of polymerization, Pn = 1000, polydispersity index, PDI =
2.4, molar mass of the repeating unit (r.u.) including trifluoroacetic
acids = 1279 g/mol), N-succinimidyl 4-formylbenzoate
(S-4FB), and N-succinimidyl 6-hydrazinonicotinate
acetone hydrazone (S-HyNic) were synthesized and characterized at
ETH Zürich by Daniel Messmer (denpol) or Dr. Chengmin Hou (S-4FB
and S-HyNic), as reported previously.31 4-Formyl-N-methyl-benzamide (methyl-4FB) was from
Fluorochem (Hadfield, UK). For other chemicals used, see Supporting Information.

2.2 Glass
Coverslips, Glass Micropipettes, and
Glass Fiber Filters
(a) Glass coverslips. Round glass coverslips
(diameter 8 mm, thickness 0.16–0.19 mm, catalog number 72296-08)
were obtained from Science Services. (b) Glass micropipettes. Two
types of glass micropipettes (BRAND disposable BLAUBRAND, intraMark,
obtained from Sigma-Aldrich) were used. Usually, they are applied
for pipetting a precise volume of 200 μL (catalog number 708757)
or 20 μL (catalog number 708718), and they are abbreviated in
this paper as “200 μL micropipettes” and “20
μL micropipettes”, respectively. The length L, the inner diameter din, and the maximum
volume Vm of the 200 μL micropipette
were 14 cm, 1.6 mm, and 280 μL, respectively. For the 20 μL
micropipette, L = 12.5 cm, din = 0.64 mm, and Vm = 40 μL
(Figure 1). (c) Glass
fiber filters. Binder-free glass fiber filters (grade GF/D, diameter
7 mm, catalog number 1823-007, lot 12887121, Whatman) were obtained
from GE Healthcare. The filters consist of borosilicate glass microfibers.
The fibers had a wide variety of lengths and thicknesses, as observed
with a field emission gun scanning electron microscope (FEG-SEM) analysis
at 10 kV by using an FEI Quanta 200F instrument (Figure 2).

Figure 2 SEM images of the glass
microfiber filters used. The horizontal
field width (HFW) is for (A) 995 μm and for (B) 29.8 μm.
For the SEM analysis, the filter was washed with an ethanol solution
(10 min, 3 times) followed by drying at atmospheric pressure in air.

2.4 Preparation
of de-PG2-BAH-BCA
Details about the modification
of de-PG2 with
S-HyNic,31 of BCA with S-4FB, and about
the preparation of the conjugate de-PG2-BAH-BCA are
given in the Supporting Information (Figure
S-1–Figure S-7).

2.5 Determination of the Activity
and Thermal
Stability of Dissolved, Free BCA, and Dissolved de-PG2-BAH-BCA
The enzymatic activity was determined with p-nitrophenylacetate (p-NA) as a substrate34−36 (see Supporting Information (Figure S-8–Figure
S-11)). BCA catalyzes the hydrolysis of p-NA into
acetate and p-nitrophenol/p-nitrophenolate
at pH = 7.2 (see Figure S-8C).

2.6 Immobilization of de-PG21000-BAH-BCA
on Microscopy Glass Coverslips
The obtained
solution of purified conjugate de-PG21000-BAH175-BCA115 (see Supporting Information) was desalted by ultrafiltration with the centrifugal
filter unit Amicon Ultra-0.5 (MWCO 50 kDa or 10 kDa) as follows. The
conjugate solution (130 μL) was first diluted with PB3 to yield
a total volume of 0.5 mL. Next, the conjugate solution was centrifuged
in the filter unit to a volume of less than 100 μL. Then, this
concentrated conjugate solution was diluted about 5 times with PB3
for the next centrifugation. This process was performed 4 times. Finally,
the desalted conjugate solution was diluted with PB3 to yield a BAH
concentration of 3.3 μM. Before immobilizing the conjugates,
the round glass coverslips were cleaned by sonication for 10 min in
ethanol. This process was performed 3 times with fresh ethanol, followed
by drying under a flow of nitrogen gas. Each dry glass coverslip was
immersed in 250 μL of the desalted conjugate solution ([BAH]
= 3.3 μM) in a 2.0 mL polypropylene tube, followed by incubation
for 1 h at room temperature. Then, the glass coverslip was recovered
from the conjugate solution and immersed in 1.5 mL of PB3 for 5 min
for washing. This process was performed 3 times with fresh PB3. In
a control measurement, a glass coverslip was prepared with the same
procedure as described above, including the washing treatments, except
that the dry coverslip was immersed in a conjugate-free PB3 solution.
The glass coverslips with immobilized conjugates and the control glass
coverslip were stored in 1.5 mL of PB3 inside 2.0 mL polypropylene
tubes at 4 °C until use.

2.7 Immobilization
of de-PG21000-BAH-BCA Inside Glass Micropipettes
The two types
of micropipettes were first cleaned by sonication in ethanol followed
by drying as described above. The immobilization of the conjugates
in the “200 μL micropipettes” was carried out
with PB3 or PB4. For each pH value, the conjugates were immobilized
in two different ways: (i) directly on the inner surface of the micropipettes
or (ii) on the inner surface of micropipettes which were first coated
with de-PG2. The conjugate solution was desalted
prior to the immobilization, as described above at the pH value to
be employed for the following immobilization step. For the direct
immobilization, case (i), the “200 μL micropipettes”
were wetted with PB3 or PB4 and then filled with the conjugate solution
([BAH] = 3.3 μM) using a 1.0 mL polypropylene syringe (HSW Norm-Ject,
Henke Sass Wolf, 4010-200V0) with a needle. The silicon tubes connected
to both ends of the micropipette were sealed for keeping the solution
inside the micropipettes for 1 h at room temperature. Then, the conjugate
solution was removed from the micropipettes, followed by washing 3
times with the buffer solution. Immobilization tests with free BCA
were also carried out at pH = 7.2 or 5.0 with the same procedure as
described above using the free BCA solution instead of the conjugate
solution. The concentration of BCA in the free enzyme solution was
the same as the concentration of BCA in the conjugate solution prepared
at [BAH] = 3.3 μM. For the immobilization of the conjugates
on the de-PG2-modified surface, case (ii), de-PG2 was first dissolved in PB5 at [de-PG2] = 10 μg/mL.26 The micropipettes
were filled with this de-PG2 solution followed by
incubation for 1 h at room temperature and then 3 times washing with
PB5. The de-PG2-modified micropipettes thus prepared
were then used for the immobilization of desalted conjugates or for
immobilization tests with free BCA at pH = 7.2 or 5.0 as in the case
of the direct immobilization. For the micropipettes with and without de-PG2 modification, control micropipettes were also prepared
with PB3 or PB4 in the absence of enzyme. The prepared micropipettes
containing immobilized conjugates or free BCA and the control micropipettes
were filled with the respective buffer solution and then stored at
4 °C until further use.

With the “20-μL micropipettes”,
only the direct immobilization of the conjugates or free BCA was performed
at pH = 7.2. The conjugate solution ([BAH] = 3.3 μM) or the
solution of free BCA was aspirated into the micropipette using a 1.0
mL polypropylene syringe which was connected to the micropipette.
The washing step was carried out by passing the buffer solution continuously
through the micropipette at a flow rate of 5.7 μL/min using
a syringe pump AL-1000 from World Precision Instruments.

2.8 Immobilization of de-PG21000-BAH-BCA
in Glass Fiber Filters
The glass fiber
filters were cleaned by incubation in ethanol for 10 min (3 times).
Evaporation of the ethanol molecules from the porous filters under
atmospheric pressure at room temperature was analyzed by measuring
the weight of the filters until it became practically unchanged. The
immobilization of de-PG21000-BAH175-BCA115 conjugates (desalted solution, see Supporting Information) or the adsorption of
free BCA was performed by immersing the dry filter in PB3 containing
either the conjugate or free BCA. The conditions used for the immobilization,
washing, and storage were the same as the ones employed for the glass
coverslips (see section 2.6).

2.9 Determination of the Activity of de-PG21000-BAH-BCA Immobilized on Microscopy Glass Coverslips
The BCA activity of the glass coverslips onto which the de-PG21000-BAH175-BCA115 conjugates
were immobilized was measured with p-NA as substrate.
The reaction was initiated at room temperature
in a 2.0 mL polypropylene tube by immersing the coverslip in 280 μL
of PB3 containing 1.0 mM p-NA. The absorbance at
405 nm of a freshly prepared 1.0 mM p-NA solution
(A405,0) was measured with a NanoDrop ND-1000 instrument
(l = 0.1 cm). After a reaction time of 15 min, the
coverslip was recovered from the reaction mixture, and A405,15 min of the solution was immediately measured.
The apparent rate of formation of product, rapp [mol·L–1·min–1], was calculated as rapp = (A405,15 – A405,0)/(t·l·ε405), with t = 15 min, l = 0.1 cm,
and ε405 = 10 510 M–1 cm–1.34 The same measurements
were also performed with the control glass coverslip to obtain the
rate of hydrolysis without enzyme, rcontrol. The difference rapp – rcontrol was used for the determination of the
apparent concentration of active BCA molecules in the reaction solution
on the basis of a comparison with a standard curve (Figure S-8A), which allowed estimating the apparent density
of active BCA molecules on the surface of the coverslip with a total
surface area of 1.0 cm2, Γapp [pmol/cm2]. In this estimation, the reaction mechanism including the
catalytic efficiency is assumed to be the same for the free and conjugated
BCA molecules. Since the estimated apparent amount of immobilized
BCA may be lower than the real total amount of immobilized BCA, another
way of expressing immobilization efficiencies is to use enzyme activity
units (U) instead of enzyme amounts (see Supporting Information). With this, the calculated amount of 1 pmol of
BCA per cm2 corresponds to 4.66 × 10–5 U per cm2.

2.10 Determination of the Activity
of Different de-PG21000-BAH-BCA Conjugates
Immobilized Inside
Glass Micropipettes
For the “200 μL and 20 μL
micropipettes” containing immobilized conjugates, the BCA activity
was determined in two different ways, either (i) in a batchwise mode
or (ii) in a continuous mode. For the micropipettes which were treated
with free BCA instead of the conjugates, exactly the same types of
analyses were carried out. All reactions were performed at room temperature
in PB3 at an initial p-NA concentration of 1.0 mM.
To initiate the batch-wise reaction, case (i), for the estimation
of Γapp, 280 and 40 μL of the substrate solution
was introduced into the “200 μL and 20 μL micropipettes”,
respectively, and incubated for 3 min. The solution was recovered,
and the absorption spectrum was then immediately measured with a NanoDrop
ND-1000 instrument (l = 0.1 cm). The initial rate
of p-NA hydrolysis was determined from A405 by taking into account the rate obtained with the
control micropipettes (empty, no BCA used at all), and Γapp was estimated. To examine the stability of immobilized
conjugates or adsorbed free BCA inside the “200 μL micropipettes”,
30 min reactions were performed repeatedly. The amount of product
formed for 30 min was determined from A405 by taking into account the amount obtained with the control micropipettes.
After each reaction, the micropipettes were washed 3 times with PB3.
For the continuous flow reaction, case (ii), the outlet of a syringe
pump (from World Precision Instruments) was connected directly to
the inlet of the “200 μL or 20 μL micropipettes”
with a silicon tube fitting. Contact between the p-NA solution and the silicon tube was avoided because of the non-negligible
interaction between p-NA and the tube. The p-NA-containing PB3 was passed through the micropipette
at a constant flow rate of about 18.4 μL/min for a “200
μL micropipette” and 2.7 or 5.7 μL/min for a “20
μL micropipette”. The reaction solution eluting from
the outlet of a micropipette was pooled every 3 min in a polypropylene
tube for the “200 μL micropipette” or collected
directly with a Gilson pipetman P-20 every 2 min at the flow rate
of 2.7 μL/min or every 1 min at 5.7 μL/min for the “20
μL micropipettes” for determining A405 with the NanoDrop instrument.

2.11 Determination
of the Activity of de-PG21000-BAH-BCA
Immobilized in Glass Fiber
Filters
The apparent rate of product formation, rapp, in the presence of glass fiber filters containing
immobilized conjugate de-PG21000-BAH175-BCA115 or adsorbed free BCA was determined at
room temperature in PB3 as follows. The weight of a wet filter was
first measured by placing the filter on a plastic weighing dish to
determine the liquid phase volume VL [L]
contained in the filter based on its dry weight (≈4.6 mg) and
the density of water at 23 °C (0.998 g/cm3). PB3 (1.0
mL) containing 1.0 mM p-NA was prepared, and A405,0 was measured at l = 0.1
cm. Then, the filter was immersed in 280 μL of the above substrate
solution to initiate the reaction. After a reaction time t = 15 min, the filter was separated from the reaction solution, and A405,15 was immediately measured. For the glass
fiber filters which were treated with free BCA instead of the conjugates,
exactly the same type of analysis was carried out. Since the concentration
of p-NA, Cp-NA, is much lower than the Michaelis constant Km (Cp-NA ≪ Km) (Figure S-10), the rate of reaction assuming Michaelis–Menten
kinetics can be approximated as first-order with respect to both Cp-NA and enzyme concentration CBCA; i.e., rapp ≈
(kcat/Km)Cp-NACCA = kappCp-NACBCA, where kcat is the rate constant. The
measured value of A405,15 was corrected
by a factor of {1 + VL/(2.8 × 10–4)}2 to yield a value which takes into account
the dilution of the reaction solution. With this and the initial p-NA concentration of 1.0 mM, the conditions used for the
standard curve obtained with known amounts of BCA (Figure S-8A), rapp [mol·L–1·min–1] for the reaction time t (= 15 min) was determined with the following equation.  In the above calculation, the enzyme molecules
are assumed to be dispersed homogeneously in the reaction system.
The rcontrol value was determined with
the control filter, assuming that the rate is first order with respect
to Cp-NA. The
apparent concentration of active BCA per surface area, Γapp, was then calculated as rapp – rcontrol and taking into account
the total outer surface area of the filter (0.92 cm2).

2.12 Flow-Through Reactor Unit Consisting of One
or More Glass Fiber Filters
Continuous flow reactions using
glass fiber filters were performed with a homemade reactor unit in
which single or stacked filters can be fixed with very soft O-rings
(Silicone O-ring, 30 Sh A, K+D AG, Hombrechtikon, Switzerland), and
the substrate solution can be passed continuously through the filters
from the inlet to the outlet (Figure 3). The reactor unit was manufactured by turning at
ETH Zürich from Delrin (= poly(oxymethylene) from DuPont),
a material which is inert toward the substrate. The design of the
reactor unit is based on a small volume apparatus for the preparation
of large unilamellar vesicles (liposomes).37 The inlet nozzle of the reactor unit was directly connected to the
outlet of the syringe pump. PB3 initially containing 1.0 mM p-NA was continuously passed through the reactor unit at
a constant flow rate. The concentration of product was measured on
the basis of A405 (l =
0.1 cm) of the droplets directly collected every 2 min at the reactor
outlet with a Gilson Pipetman P-20.

Figure 3 Home-made reactor unit for the continuous
hydrolysis of p-NA with glass microfiber filters
containing immobilized
conjugates or adsorbed free BCA. The reactor unit consists of two
filter holder units (1 and 4), a glass fiber filter (3), and two O-rings
(2). One filter (3) with one O-ring on each side was first mounted
on the plane A within unit 1, and then, unit 4 was screwed finger
tight into unit 1 to fix the filter with the O-rings between the planes
A and B. The distance between the plane A and B can be adjusted manually
so as not to induce breakage of the filters along the O-rings. Two
stacked filters can also be fixed in the holder unit by adjusting
the above distance adequately. The distances in the drawing are given
in mm.

3 Results
and Discussion
3.1 Modification of de-PG21000 with S-HyNic
The deprotected
denpol de-PG21000 was partially modified
with S-HyNic in aqueous
solution at pH = 7.6 (MOPSB) and then purified by repetitive ultrafiltration
(see Supporting Information). The concentration
of r.u. in the obtained purified de-PG21000-HyNic solution was determined as 1.93 mM on the basis of the Trypan
Blue assay.38,39 The concentration of HyNic in
this solution was 0.85 mM, as determined through reaction with 4-nitrobenzaldehyde
(Figure S-1). Since each r.u. carries four
amino groups, the molar substitution ratio MSR (HyNic) of the prepared de-PG21000-HyNic on the basis of the amino group
content was 0.11 (= 0.85 mM/(4·1.93 mM)). This means that on
average 440 HyNic moieties were introduced per 1000 r.u. and that
such 1000 r.u. long HyNic-modified chain still had on average 3560
free amino groups. This solution of purified de-PG21000-HyNic was stored at 4 °C and used throughout this
work.

3.2 Modification of BCA with S-4FB
BCA
(80 μM) was modified with S-4FB (160 μM) at pH = 7.2 (PB1)
(see Supporting Information). These buffer
conditions were found to be optimal for the modification of BCA. After
purification by repetitive ultrafiltration, the concentration of 4FB
in the obtained purified BCA-4FB solution was determined as 74 ±
18 μM through reaction with 2-HP (2-hydrazinopyridine) (mean
value ± standard deviation from five independent preparations)
(Figure S-2). The concentration of BCA
in this BCA-4FB solution was estimated as 76 ± 3 μM through
enzyme activity measurements by assuming that the activity of the
modified enzyme was not different from the activity of the unmodified
enzyme. This assumption is supported experimentally (Figure S-11). Accordingly, the molar substitution ratio MSR
(4FB) was calculated as 0.97 ± 0.26, meaning that one BCA molecule
was modified with on average about one 4FB moiety.

For one of
the preparations, the MSR was also determined with an alternative
spectrophotometric method (see Supporting Information). This method is based on fitting the measured absorption spectrum
of the obtained solution of purified BCA-4FB with the absorption spectra
of solutions of the model compound methyl-4FB and free (unmodified)
BCA, both spectra recorded at known concentrations in PB1. Figure 4A shows the UV-absorption
spectra of methyl-4FB and free BCA, plotted as molar absorption coefficient,
ε, vs wavelength. In Figure 4B, the absorption spectrum of a solution of purified
BCA-4FB at an unknown concentration is compared with the absorption
spectrum which was obtained by fitting (linear combination of the
spectra of free BCA and methyl-4FB). The measured and fitted spectra
agree well with each other for 49.5 μM methyl-4FB and 75.9 μM
BCA, corresponding to MSR (4FB) = 0.65 (= 49.5 μM/75.9 μM).
The concentration of 4FB in this purified BCA-4FB solution was separately
determined as 54 ± 14 μM (n = 9) through
reaction with 2-HP. This concentration is consistent with the concentration
determined by the spectral fitting (≈50 μM). Furthermore,
the concentration of BCA resulting from the spectral fitting (≈76
μM) agrees with the enzymatic determination of the BCA concentration
in solutions of purified BCA-4FB (76 ± 3 μM, see above).
Therefore, the spectra analysis method can be considered as a reliable
and simple alternative method for the determination of MSR (4FB) of
purified 4-FB-modified enzymes.

spectrum of a solution of purified BCA-4FB (blue curve) at unknown
concentrations of 4FB and BCA and the fitted spectrum of BCA-4FB (red

of methyl-4FB and free BCA shown in (A). Wavelength range: 251–327
nm. For this wavelength range, the measured absorbance of the purified
BCA-4FB solution, Ameas, was assumed to
linearly depend on the concentrations and molar absorption coefficients
of free BCA (CBCA and εBCA) and BCA-4FB (CBCA-4FB and εBCA-4FB), whereby for BCA-4FB the molar absorption coefficient,
εBCA-4FB, is taken as the sum of εBCA and εm-4FB: Ameas = CBCA·l·εBCA + Cm-4FB·l·εm-4FB + Cm-4FB·l·εBCA = CBCA·l·εBCA + Cm-4FB·l·(εm-4FB + εBCA); l is the optical path length of the
cuvette used (l = 0.2 cm). The fitting was made with
the software “R”, resulting in the best fit with CBCA = 75.9 and Cm-4FB = 49.5 μM, corresponding to MSR (4FB) = 0.65 (see text for
details).

Another preparation of purified
BCA-4FB was analyzed by ESI-MS.
In Figure S-5A, the unmodified BCA molecules
show a molecular mass of 29 024 Da which corresponds to the
value calculated on the basis of the primary sequence (29 024.5
Da) without zinc ion.2 A similar value
(29 024.34 Da) was reported in the literature.40 For the BCA-4FB molecules (Figure S-5B), peaks with masses of 29 025, 29 157, and 29 289
are seen. This shows that the purified BCA-4FB solution analyzed contained
a mixture of unmodified BCA molecules (Mr(BCA) = 29 025), BCA molecules which were modified with one
4FB moiety (Mr(BCA-4FB) = Mr(BCA) + 132 = 29 157), and BCA molecules which
were modified with two 4FB moieties (Mr(BCA-4FB2) = Mr(BCA) + 132
× 2 = 29 289).

3.3 Formation of the Conjugate de-PG2-BAH-BCA
The type of denpol-BAH-enzyme conjugate
which
we used in the work was prepared by simple mixing of an aqueous solution
of de-PG21000-HyNic and an aqueous solution
of BCA-4FB at pH = 7.2 (PB2). Details for the synthesis and characterization
of the obtained conjugates de-PG21000-BAHy-BCAz are summarized
in Table 1A and Figure S-12 (for de-PG21000-BAH175-BCA115). During the course
of our investigations, five de-PG2-BAH-BCA conjugates
were synthesized by using the same de-PG21000-HyNic preparation; the different conjugates vary in the average
number of BAH units (y) and BCA molecules (z) per denpol chain. The conjugate solutions were further
characterized in terms of BCA activity and storage stability. Both
are essential if one aims at applying the conjugates on silicate surfaces.

b The MSR values of no. 4 and 5
were calculated on the basis of absorbance at 280 nm of purified BCA-4FB
solutions and experimentally determined concentrations of 4FB; see
the legend to Figure 4 for details including the equation used.

In the following, the preparation and characterization
of one of
the five conjugates are described in great detail for explaining the
meaning and determination of the entries of Table 1A. The conjugate (entry 1 of Table 1A) was prepared by mixing a
portion of the de-PG21000-HyNic solution
(258 μL, 1.93 mM r.u., 0.85 mM HyNic, MSR (HyNic) = 0.11) with
a portion of a BCA-4FB solution (1542 μL, 76 μM BCA, 78
μM 4FB, MSR (4FB) = 1.02) to induce conjugate formation under
the following reaction (t) conditions: total volume
= 1800 μL, [HyNic]r = 122 μM, [r.u.]r = 277 μM, [BCA]overall,r (= [BCA-4FB] + [free BCA])
= 65.1 μM, and [4FB]r = 66.5 μM (4FB:HyNic
= 1:1.8) (Table 1A and Figure S-12). A portion of the reaction
mixture (350 μL) was immediately placed into a quartz cell (l = 0.2 cm) for spectrophotometrically following the reaction.
The rest of the solution (1450 μL) was incubated in a polypropylene
tube for 20 h, and then, a portion (1300 μL) was used for the
purification. The total amount of BCA-4FB and free BCA in the reaction
mixture employed for the purification (1.3 mL) was 84.6 nmol, while
that removed from the mixture by repetitive ultrafiltration was 43.0
nmol (Figure S-7B). Therefore, based on
simple mass balance consideration, the amount of BCA-4FB conjugated
to de-PG21000 in the conjugate was 41.6
nmol (= 84.6 nmol – 43.0 nmol). The concentration of BAH in
the purified conjugate solution [BAH]p was determined as
[BAH]p = {(A354,p – A354,pb)/(A354,r – A354,rb)} [BAH]r, where A354,p and A354,r represent
the absorbance at 354 nm of the purified solution (p) and the reaction
mixture (r), respectively; the terms with additional subscript b correspond
to the background absorbance. The above equation can be simplified
to [BAH]p = (A354,p/A354,r) [BAH]r because (A354,r/A354,rb) is equal to
(A354,p/A354,pb). Assuming that the ratio of [BAH]/[r.u.] remained unchanged during
the purification, the concentration of r.u. in the solution of the
purified conjugate, [r.u.]p, was [r.u.]p = (A354,p/A354,r) [r.u.]r, where [r.u.]r is the concentration of r.u. in
the reaction mixture. The ratio A354,p/A354,r for the discussed conjugate preparation
was 0.92, yielding [r.u.]p = 255 μM and [BAH]p = 44.5 μM (Table 1B). The [BAH]p/[r.u.]p ratio was
0.175, meaning that 175 BAH bonds were present per 1000 r.u. The concentration
of BCA in the purified conjugate solution was [BCA]p =
(41.6 × 10–9 mol × 0.92)/(1.3 × 10–3 L) = 29.4 × 10–6 M = 29.4
μM. With this, [BCA]p/[BAH]p = 0.66 (<1),
which indicates that a part of the BCA molecules was conjugated to de-PG21000 through multiple BAH bonds/per enzyme
molecule. This is reasonable because BCA molecules with multiple 4FB
units were present in the purified BCA-4FB solution, as indicated
by the ESI-MS analysis (Figure S-5B). The
[BCA]p/[r.u.]p ratio in the purified conjugate
solution was 0.115 (= 29.4 μM/255 μM), which means that
on average 115 BCA molecules were conjugated per 1000 r.u. Based on
this analysis, the purified conjugate was abbreviated as de-PG21000-BAH175-BCA115.

a Quantification of the conjugates
obtained resulted in the following specification. Entry 1: de-PG21000-BAH175-BCA115, Entry 2: de-PG21000-BAH179-BCA100, Entry 3: de-PG21000-BAH173-BCA154, Entry 4: de-PG21000-BAH451-BCA293, Entry 5: de-PG21000-BAH176-BCA111.

In the next step, the
activity of the conjugated BCA was examined
and compared with the spectrophotometrically determined BAH concentration.
For this, the conjugate solution was desalted by repetitive ultrafiltration.
From the measured A354 value of this purified
and desalted conjugate solution and by taking into account [BCA]p/[BAH]p = 0.66 (see above), the BCA concentration
in the desalted solution of the conjugate was determined as 26.0 μM,
a bit lower than the concentration determined before desalting (29.4
μM, see above). A determination of the BCA concentration in
this solution through measurements of the esterase activity with p-NA and considering a calibration curve made with known
amounts of BCA yielded an apparent concentration of BCA of 18.7 μM.
This indicates that either the BCA molecules underwent a partial inactivation
during the conjugation reaction or denpol binding of BCA altered the
reaction kinetics, possibly due to a decreased substrate access to
the enzyme’s active site. However, a large fraction (72%, i.e.,
18.7 μM of 26.0 μM) of the original BCA activity remained
in the desalted conjugate solution.

With the same 4FB:HyNic
ratio of 1:1.8 applied for the conjugation
reaction which yielded de-PG21000-BAH175-BCA115, the two conjugates de-PG21000-BAH179-BCA100 and de-PG21000-BAH173-BCA154 were obtained by using a solution of either BCA-4FB with MSR (4FB)
= 1.17 or BCA-4FB with MSR (4FB) = 0.54 (Table 1A, Figure S-13). Although the few preparations did not allow a true statistical
analysis, it seems that the differences in the [BAH]/[BCA] ratio in
the conjugates resulted from an increase in MSR (4FB) of the BCA-4FB
used, i.e., from an increase of the fractional amount of BCA modified
with multiple 4FB units per enzyme molecule. If the conjugates were
prepared at different 4FB:HyNic ratios of 1.6:1 and 1:2.3, de-PG21000-BAH451-BCA293 and de-PG21000-BAH176-BCA111 were obtained, respectively (Table 1A, Figure S-13).

In summary, with the different denpol-BAH-BCA conjugates
prepared
in this work, we have proven that the general protocols which we developed
for the synthesis and purification of these types of conjugates are
reliable. From the same de-PG21000-HyNic
different de-PG21000-BAHy-BCAz conjugates can be prepared
which differ in y and z by choosing
the experimental conditions in terms of (i) degree of BCA modification
with 4FB, (ii) the concentrations of 4FB and HyNic applied during
the conjugate preparation, and (iii) the used ratio of 4FB to HyNic.

3.4 Stability of de-PG2-BAH-BCA
in Aqueous Solution
The activity of the conjugate de-PG21000-BAH175-BCA115 during storage in solution (PB2) at 4 °C was measured by withdrawing
small volumes which were analyzed with p-NA as substrate.
Under these conditions (ca. 30 μM BCA, pH = 7.2, presence of
1.15 M NaCl), the conjugate was very stable: after a period of 41
days, 97% of the initial activity remained (Figure 5A, filled circles). From a practical point
of view, this finding is very important since once prepared the same
conjugate solution can be used over an extended period of time if
stored at 4 °C. In the case of experiments with free BCA, dissolved
in the same buffer solution at about the same BCA concentration, it
was shown that the free enzyme is also stable (Figure 5A, empty circles).

Figure 5 Storage stability of de-PG2-BAH-BCA (●)
and free BCA (○) in aqueous solution at pH = 7.2 for T = 4 °C (A) and 25 °C ≤ T ≤ 70 °C (B). (A) Remaining relative activity of a de-PG21000-BAH175-BCA115 solution (●) and of free BCA (○), which was stored
at 4 °C in PB2 (pH = 7.2) in a polypropylene tube at an initial
volume of 1.3 mL. The overall concentration of BCA was 29.4 μM.
For the activity measurements, aliquots (10 μL) were withdrawn
and diluted with 980 μL of PB1 (pH = 7.2), followed by addition
of 10 μL of substrate solution (100 mM p-NA
in acetonitrile). The total concentration of NaCl during the activity
measurement at 25 °C was 0.16 M. The background hydrolysis of
1.0 mM p-NA was also measured in a 0.1 M phosphate
buffer solution containing 0.16 M NaCl in the absence of enzyme and
then subtracted from the value obtained with the enzyme. The data
thus obtained and shown represent mean values ± standard deviations
(n = 3). The activity measured before storage was
taken as 100%. (B) Effect of temperature on the relative activity
of de-PG21000-BAH451-BCA293 (●) and free BCA (○) dissolved
in PB3 (pH = 7.2). In both cases, the BCA concentration was about
3.4 μM. The samples were incubated at the indicated temperature
for 30 min followed by incubation at 25 °C for 30 min. Then,
the BCA activity was measured with 1.0 mM p-NA at
25 °C (see Supporting Information).
The measured activity at 25 °C in PB3 without heat treatment
was taken as 100%. The rates of hydrolysis in the presence of the
conjugate at T ≥ 60 °C and in the presence
of free BCA at T = 70 °C were smaller than the
rate of the background hydrolysis. In these cases, the relative activity
of BCA was taken as zero. The number of measurements n was n = 3 at 25–55 °C for both free
BCA and conjugates, and n = 2 at 60–65 °C
and n = 1 at 67 °C for free BCA. For the cases
of n ≥ 2, the data represent mean values ±
standard deviations.

The heat stabilities of dissolved de-PG21000-BAH451-BCA293 and free BCA were
examined (Figure 5B).
Although for
some data points the standard deviations are high, it is evident that
the free enzyme is more stable at high temperature (T > 55 °C) than the conjugated enzyme. A significant deactivation
of free BCA is seen at about 65 °C, in agreement with previous
literature data,41,42 whereas the deactivation of BCA
in the conjugate occurs already at about 50 °C. The kinetics
of BCA inactivation for the free enzyme and the denpol-bound enzyme
were compared at 60 °C, and this comparison confirmed again a
lower stability for the conjugate enzyme as compared to free BCA (Figure S-14). The reason for the lower thermostability
of the conjugated enzyme, as compared to free BCA, is not clear. It
may be that interactions of the many free amino groups of the denpol
chain with the conjugated BCA molecules have a negative effect. However,
this is only a hypothesis and deserves further investigations if one
would aim at applying such conjugates in aqueous solution at high
temperatures. One approach toward increasing the thermostability of
CA is to modify the enzyme’s shape through directed evolution.
Alvizo et al. have shown that the stability of CA from Desulfovibrio
vulgaris could be significantly improved with this approach
for applying the enzyme to capturing carbon dioxide in flue gas.43

3.5 Activity of de-PG21000-BAH175-BCA115 Immobilized
on Microscopy Glass
Coverslips
The enzyme activity of glass coverslips which
contained immobilized de-PG21000-BAH175-BCA115 was measured at pH = 7.2 (PB3) with 1.0
mM p-NA as substrate. The initial rate of reaction
was determined by quantifying the conversion of p-NA, xp-NA, after
15 min, corresponding to about 2% of the initially present p-NA. From this determination and by taking into account
the contribution from the nonenzymatic hydrolysis and a calibration
curve made with known amounts of free BCA (Figure S-8), the apparent surface density of active BCA molecules,
Γapp, was then calculated by considering the total
surface area (≈1.0 cm2) of one coverslip. The obtained
value was Γapp = (3.5 ± 0.1) × 10–4 U/cm2 (= 7.6 ± 0.3 pmol/cm2) (mean and
standard deviation from the analysis of n = 3 different
freshly prepared coverslips). This analysis shows that the immobilization
of the conjugate is very reproducible and that about 4.6 × 1012 active BCA molecules were immobilized in the form of conjugates
on the surface of one coverslip. It is likely that the positively
charged free amino groups of the denpol chain contribute significantly
to the immobilization of the conjugate on the negatively charged silicate
glass coverslips. If one assumes that the glass surface is molecularly
flat and if it would be completely covered by a monolayer of BCA molecules
with a hydrodynamic diameter of 4.1 nm,44 then one obtains an occupancy of Γ = 6.1 × 10–4 U/cm2 (13 pmol/cm2). This value is higher
than Γapp = 3.5 ± 0.1 U/cm2 (7.6
± 0.3 pmol/cm2) for the conjugate but still of the
same order of magnitude. It is expected that a part of the BCA molecules
of the conjugate is in close contact to the surface, possibly undergoing
(partial) inactivation, and another part of the BCA molecules is exposed
to the aqueous solution.

3.6 Activity of de-PG21000-BAHy-BCAz Immobilized Inside Glass Micropipettes
The conjugate de-PG21000-BAH175-BCA115 was immobilized inside the “200 μL
micropipettes”
at pH = 7.2 (PB3) and [BAH] = 3.3 μM. In control measurements
it was shown that the glass surface of the micropipettes without immobilized
enzyme had little effect on the initial hydrolysis of p-NA under the conditions employed (xp-NA < 0.1% after a reaction time of 3 min).
The calculated Γapp value obtained for BCA of the
immobilized conjugate was (4.5 ± 0.2) × 10–4 U/cm2 (9.7 ± 0.5 pmol/cm2) on the basis
of initial activity measurements (xp-NA ≈ 4% after a reaction time of 3 min). This
value is very similar to the value obtained for the glass coverslips
(3.5 ± 0.1 U/cm2 (7.6 ± 0.3 pmol/cm2); see section 3.5). If free BCA molecules
were used during the immobilization procedure instead of the conjugate,
a much smaller Γapp value of 4.7 × 10–7 U/cm2 (0.01 pmol/cm2) was obtained. Similarly,
in the case of “20 μL micropipettes”, the Γapp values were (4.1 ± 0.4) × 10–4 U/cm2 (8.7 ± 0.8 pmol/cm2) and 9.3 ×
10–7 U/cm2 (0.02 pmol/cm2),
for the immobilized conjugates and free BCA, respectively. These results
clearly demonstrate that the conjugates can be efficiently immobilized
inside the micropipettes under conditions where the noncovalent adsorption
of free BCA is very low. The Γapp value decreased
when the conjugates were immobilized at lower concentrations of BAH
but at an identical immobilization time of 1 h, as examined with the
“200 μL micropipettes” (see Figure S-15).

To examine more details about the interaction
between the conjugates and the glass surface, the conjugate de-PG21000-BAH179-BCA100 was immobilized inside “200 μL micropipettes”
at pH = 5.0 (PB4) in addition to pH = 7.2 (PB3). As shown in Table 2, for de-PG21000-BAH179-BCA100, Γapp for the pH = 5.0 conditions was slightly larger than for
the pH = 7.2 conditions. The reason for this difference may be the
higher positive charge of the BCA molecules at pH = 5.0, as compared
to pH = 7.2 (pI(BCA) = 5.9),2 which would
favor electrostatic interactions with the negatively charged glass
surface. However, the many positively charged amino groups from the
denpol (pKa ≈ 8–9)31 of the conjugate system seem to be the determinants
for the strong noncovalent binding of the conjugate to the glass surface.
Therefore, the effect of precoating the inner surface of the micropipettes
with de-PG21000 on the immobilization
of the conjugate at pH = 7.2 or 5.0 was also examined. This precoating
is expected to modify the negatively charged silicate surface significantly,26 as in the case of the coating with polylysine.45−47 As shown in Table 2, the conjugate did also adsorb on the de-PG21000-modified surface, both at pH = 7.2 and 5.0. Based on the
relatively large Γapp value of 6.5 × 10–4 U/cm2 (13.9 pmol/cm2) at pH
= 7.2 > pI(BCA), one is tempted to conclude that the (overall)
negatively
charged BCA molecules which are bound along the denpol chain contribute
to the immobilization of the conjugate to those areas of the glass
surface which were coated with positively charged de-PG21000. However, the conjugate also bound to the de-PG21000-modified surface at pH = 5.0 <
pI(BCA), although in this case Γapp (= 3.9 ×
10–4 U/cm2 (8.4 pmol/cm2))
was lower than at pH = 7.2 (Γapp = 6.5 × 10–4 U/cm2 (13.9 pmol/cm2)). If
one assumes that de-PG21000 was relatively
densely adsorbed on the glass surface, as concluded from a previous
study with de-PG21400,29 then it seems that the immobilization of the conjugate
not only is based on electrostatic interactions but must also involve
nonelectrostatic contributions. On the other hand, both positively
and negatively charged sites distinctly exist on the surface of BCA
at pH values below and above pI.23 Therefore,
negatively charged local sites of BCA23 may contribute to the interaction of the conjugate with the positively
charged denpol coat, even at pH = 5.0.

The immobilization
(adsorption) of free BCA was also examined at
pH = 7.2 or 5.0 using micropipettes with and without preadsorbed de-PG1000 (Table 2). Under all conditions examined, only trace amounts
of free BCA molecules remained inside the micropipettes if the same
immobilization procedure was applied as in the case of the conjugates
(see section 2.7). This is in very clear
contrast to the results obtained with the conjugates. Notably, even
under conditions where the free BCA molecules have a net charge opposite
to that of the solid surface (pH = 7.2 > pI(BCA)), only small amounts
of active enzyme were adsorbed. Therefore, the interaction of single
BCA molecules with the glass surface may not be strong enough for
a stable immobilization. In contrast, one de-PG21000-BAH179-BCA100 molecule has on average
100 conjugated BCA molecules and as much as 3560 free amino groups
from the denpol (see section 3.1). Therefore,
the conjugate provides many opportunities to interact with a negatively
or positively charged surface through a large number of weak interactions
between the surface and the denpol or the surface and the enzyme.
To which extent the BCA molecules contribute to the binding of the
conjugate to the surface—with a possible concomitant partial
BCA inactivation—is not clear at the moment. However, the three-dimensional
“worm-like” structure of the conjugate certainly contributes
to their high immobilization efficiency because a large fraction of
the conjugate’s BCA molecules is expected to be without direct
contact with the surface.

The “200 μL micropipettes”
containing either
immobilized de-PG21000-BAH179-BCA100 or adsorbed free BCA were used for a batch
reaction analysis at pH = 7.2 (PB3). The extent of p-NA hydrolysis was determined upon filling the micropipettes
with a 1 mM p-NA solution and keeping it inside the
pipettes for 30 min. The micropipettes were used repeatedly for 5
times to check the stability of the immobilized enzymes (Figure 6). The immobilized
conjugates remained active even after the fifth reaction, although
the amount of product formed during the 30 min incubation slightly
decreased with increasing number of repeated reactions. Similar results
were obtained in a separate preparation with “200 μL
micropipettes” inside which a slightly different conjugate, de-PG21000-BAH173-BCA154, was immobilized at pH = 7.2 and used with 6 repeated batch reactions
(Figure S-16).

μL micropipettes” containing immobilized de-PG21000-BAH179-BCA100 or adsorbed

for 30 min at an initial concentration of p-NA of
1.0 mM in PB3 (pH = 7.2). [Product] = [p-nitrophenolate]
+ [p-nitrophenol].

The flow-through reaction with a 1 mM p-NA solution was performed using “20 μL micropipettes”
containing either immobilized de-PG21000-BAH175-BCA115 or adsorbed free BCA. The reaction
was also performed with a control micropipette without BCA for determining
the nonenzymatic background reaction. The flow rate was set to 2.7
μL/min corresponding to a mean residence time τ of 15
min, followed by an increase to 5.7 μL/min (τ = 7.0 min)
after 120 min. Figure 7A shows the time course of the concentration of product, CP,out, at the outlet of the micropipette. For
the control micropipette, CP,out gradually
increased with time, independent of the flow rate, confirming that
the glass surface is catalytically inert. The micropipette containing
adsorbed free BCA gave practically the same reaction time course as
the control micropipette, meaning that the activity of possibly adsorbed
free BCA was negligible. On the other hand, the micropipette containing
immobilized conjugates clearly catalyzed the hydrolysis of p-NA, yielding an almost constant CP,out of about 300 μM for the chosen observation time
of 120 min. Considering the background hydrolysis of p-NA (empty triangles in Figure 7A), the amount of enzymatically produced product continuously
decreased with increasing operation time (Figure S-17). From the data shown in Figure 7A it is clear that CP,out obtained with a micropipette containing immobilized conjugates
depends on the flow rate, which is expected from the kinetics in a
plug flow (Figure S-17). The reaction was
also performed with a larger “200 μL micropipette”,
again containing immobilized de-PG21000-BAH175-BCA115, by setting the flow rate to
18.4 μL/min (τ = 15 min). The results obtained are shown
in Figure 7B. After
15 min, CP,out was about 125 μM.
For the smaller “20 μL micropipette”, CP,out reached 313 μM after 14 min at the
same mean residence time τ of 15 min. In another set of measurements,
the conjugate de-PG21000-BAH451-BCA293 was also immobilized in a “200 μL
micropipette” and tested as a flow reactor; the results obtained
are in agreement with the ones obtained with de-PG21000-BAH175-BCA115 (see Figure S-18).

Figure 7 (A) Time courses of flow-through reactions with “20
μL
micropipettes” containing immobilized conjugate de-PG21000-BAH175-BCA115 (filled circles)
or adsorbed free BCA (filled squares); results from a “20 μL
control micropipette” are also shown (empty triangles, no BCA).
PB3 initially containing 1.0 mM p-NA (pH = 7.2) was
continuously passed through the micropipettes. The absorption spectrum
of the solution eluting from the micropipettes was measured, and A405 was converted into Cp,out = [p-nitrophenolate] + [p-nitrophenol] (see section 2.10). The
flow rate was 2.7 μL/min (mean residence time τ = 15 min)
for the first 120 min, and then at the time indicated by the arrows,
the flow rate was increased to 5.7 μL/min (τ = 7.0 min).
The empty circles are the data for a “20 μL micropipette”
containing immobilized de-PG21000-BAH175-BCA115, which was washed first with PB3 before
the substrate solution was pumped trough. This washing was at a flow
rate of 14.3 μL/min for 218 min. (B) Reaction time courses for
a “200 μL micropipette” containing immobilized de-PG21000-BAH175-BCA115 (filled reverse triangles) and for a “200-μL control
micropipette” (no, BCA, empty reverse triangles). The reaction
was performed by passing the substrate solution at a flow rate of
18.4 μL/min (τ = 15 min) through the micropipette.

Since the catalytic reaction occurs
at the solid–liquid
interface inside the micropipettes, the ratio of surface area to volume
is expected to affect CP,out. The present
results clearly demonstrate that the “20 μL micropipette”
system with a surface area to volume ratio of 6.3 × 103 m–1 is much more efficient than the “200
μL micropipette” system with its smaller surface area
to volume ratio of 2.5 × 103 m–1. For the “200 μL micropipette” system, the concentration
of enzymatically produced product gradually decreased as the operation
time elapsed (Figure S-17 and Figure S-18B), in agreement with what was found for the “20 μL micropipette”
(see above). Concerning this point, the following prewashing tests
are important to mention. The “20 μL micropipette”
containing immobilized conjugate de-PG21000-BAH175-BCA115 was washed with PB3 at a high
flow rate of 14.3 μL/min for 218 min prior to running the flow-through
reaction with p-NA. Although after this washing step
the micropipette still contained immobilized active BCA which catalyzed
the hydrolysis of p-NA, as shown in Figure 7A, the outlet conversion decreased
to about 70% of that obtained with the micropipette prior to washing.
Γapp decreased from 4.2 × 10–4 U/cm2 (9.0 pmol/cm2) (before washing) to 3.0
× 10–4 U/cm2 (6.5 pmol/cm2) (after washing). This indicates that a fraction of the originally
immobilized BCA became inactive or desorbed from the glass surface
under the shear stress generated in the micropipettes.

3.7 Activity of de-PG21000-BAH175-BCA115 Immobilized in Glass Fiber Filters
The
immobilization of the conjugate de-PG21000-BAH175-BCA115 in binder-free glass
fiber filters was carried out by simply immersing the purified and
dry filter in an aqueous solution of the conjugate (PB3), followed
by washing with the same buffer solution (see section 2.11). For a direct comparison with flat, nonporous
glass coverslips, the apparent density of active BCA molecules on
the filter surface, Γapp, was determined through
BCA activity measurements and by taking into account the calculated
total “outer” surface area of the filter (0.92 cm2) with the assumption of a flat surface. For comparison, the
filters were also immersed in a solution of free BCA instead of the
conjugate, followed by the same washing procedure as in the case of
the conjugate. As a result, Γapp for the conjugate
was (14.7 ± 1.5) × 10–4 U/cm2 (31.6 ± 3.2 pmol/cm2) (n = 4),
which was larger than the values determined for the conjugates immobilized
on glass coverslips ((3.5 ± 0.1) × 10–4 U/cm2 (7.6 ± 0.3 pmol/cm2)) or on the
inner surface of micropipettes (5.2 × 10–4 U/cm2 (11.2 pmol/cm2)) (see above). This is reasonable
since the glass fiber filters have a porous structure (Figure 2), and thus the conjugates
can adsorb to the microfibers not only at the area which is exposed
to the bulk liquid but also at the inner parts of the filter. Notably,
the filters containing adsorbed free BCA molecules yielded Γapp = (8.4 ± 1.4) × 10–4 U/cm2 (18.1 ± 2.9 pmol/cm2) (n = 3), whereas practically no free BCA adsorbed in the
case of the coverslips or micropipettes (see above). This indicates
that free BCA molecules probably can diffuse into the pores of the
fiber matrix of the filter, where they have several opportunities
to adsorb through multiple interactions. Furthermore, the release
of free BCA molecules from the filter during the washing step may
be sterically hindered.

In a next step, we investigated whether
BCA-containing glass fiber filters can be applied as flow-through
reactor systems. For this, one filter containing immobilized conjugate
was first mounted in a homemade reactor unit (Figure 3). This device was then used as a flow-through
reactor with monitoring of the hydrolysis of p-NA
(Figure 8A, curve 1).
The reaction was also studied with a single filter with adsorbed free
BCA (Figure 8A, curve
2) and with a control filter (no BCA, Figure 8A, curve 3). The use of the control filter
yielded a comparable time course of CP,out as in the case of the control glass micropipette (Figure 7A), demonstrating that the
glass fiber filter is catalytically inert toward the hydrolysis of p-NA, as in the case of the glass micropipettes (see above).
With the filter containing immobilized conjugates, the hydrolysis
of p-NA was clearly accelerated; i.e., significantly
larger CP,out values were obtained as
compared to the BCA-free control system. However, from the data shown
in Figure 8A it is
clear that with the filter containing adsorbed free BCA the p-NA hydrolysis reaction was also catalyzed, although CP,out at 180 min reaction was about one-half
of the value obtained with the filter containing immobilized conjugates
(compare curves 1 and 2). To examine the stability of the immobilized
conjugates and of adsorbed free BCA, freshly prepared filters were
prewashed with PB3 at high flow rate (30–32 μL/min for
4.5 h). As shown in Figure 8A, the time course of CP,out in
the case of the prewashed filters containing immobilized conjugates
was not significantly different from the filter which was not prewashed
(compare curves 1 and 4). This demonstrates that the inactivation
or desorption of the conjugates from the filter during the prewashing
was negligible, while for the filter containing adsorbed free BCA
(compare curves 2 and 5), the catalytic performance clearly decreased
after the high-flow washing step (Figure 8A). This suggests that a part of the adsorbed
free BCA molecules desorbed from the filter during the prewashing
process. However, the remaining adsorbed free BCA molecules still
exhibited a stable catalytic activity at an operational flow rate
of 2.7 μL/min. The time courses of the “true”
enzymatically produced product by using filters with immobilized conjugates
or adsorbed free BCA were then calculated by subtracting the nonenzymatic
contribution. The data obtained show that the filter with the immobilized
conjugate was clearly more efficient than the filter with adsorbed
free BCA (Figure S-19), but the difference
was by no means as large as in the case of the micropipettes (Figure 7A).

Figure 8 (A) Time courses of the
hydrolysis of p-NA in
a continuous flow reactor system which consisted of a single glass
fiber filter containing immobilized conjugate de-PG21000-BAH175-BCA115 (1 and 4) or adsorbed
free BCA (2 and 5). A control filter without BCA was also used under
the same conditions (3). The reaction was performed without (1 and
2) or with (4 and 5) prewashing with PB3 (pH = 7.2). The prewashing
was performed at a flow rate of 30.4 μL/min for 4.5 h for the
immobilized conjugates and 31.8 μL/mL for 4.5 h for the adsorbed
free BCA. For the reaction, PB3 which initially contained 1.0 mM p-NA was continuously passed through the filter. After initial
small adjustments of the flow rate, it was set to a fixed value of
2.7 μL/min after about 60 min for a further operation during
120 min. (B) The same flow-through reaction as in (A) with a flow
rate of 2.7 μL/min but by using either two stacked glass fiber
filters containing immobilized conjugate de-PG21000-BAH175-BCA115 (filled reverse triangles)
or two stacked control filters (no BCA, empty reverse triangles).
For a drawing of the filter holder, see Figure 3.

From a practical point of view, it is important to mention
that
for all reactions without and with high-flow prewashing, no breakage
of the glass fiber filters was observed when the filters were removed
from the flow reactor unit (Figure 3).

Finally, we tested whether two stacked glass
fiber filters can
be used sequentially. Figure 8B shows the reaction operation with two stacked filters, both
containing either immobilized conjugate de-PG21000-BAH175-BCA115 or no enzyme at all
(used as control). The analysis with the latter control filters gave
a similar time course of CP,out as in
the case of the single filter (Figure 8A). This confirmed that the filters as such were catalytically
inert. On the other hand, the use of the two stacked filters containing
immobilized conjugates resulted in significantly higher CP,out values than in the case of the corresponding single
filter use. This is reasonable since the amount of immobilized enzyme
molecules is higher for two filters as compared to one filter. Moreover,
the successful use of stacked filters containing immobilized enzymes
opens a door for applications in enzymatic cascade reactions with
filters containing different types of enzymes.

4 Conclusions
Different de-PG21000-BAH-BCA conjugates
were prepared by linking BCA-4FB molecules to de-PG2-HyNic
chains through stable BAH bonds. The conjugates were prepared in aqueous
solution at room temperature and pH = 7.2 in the presence of 1.15
M NaCl. The use of high amounts of NaCl was found to be critical for
preventing precipitation during conjugate formation. The advantage
of the “BAH chemistry”27,28 is that the
individual steps of the conjugate formation can be quantified spectrophotometrically.
This is usually not the case for other linker chemistries.

Although
the general methodology of conjugate formation by using
a water-soluble polycationic dendronized polymer was developed a few
years ago already by using horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and bovine
erythrocytes superoxide dismutase (SOD),39 for each new enzyme of interest, the experimental conditions have
to be adopted. Furthermore, once succeeded with the conjugate formation,
the conjugate stability in aqueous solution is important to know if
one considers applications. In the work presented, we have shown that de-PG21000-BAH-BCA conjugates can be prepared
under the elaborated conditions with high reproducibility and that
these conjugates are stable in aqueous solution for more than one
month if stored at pH = 7.2 and 4 °C (Figure 5A). Since there is a continuous desire for
optimizing and possibly simplifying the quantification of the different
steps of the conjugate formation, we tried to apply for the first
time a simple spectrophotometric fitting procedure for the quantification
of 4FB-modified BCA by using BCA and methyl-4FB as reference compounds
(Figure 4). Since the
spectrophotometric fitting procedure gave reliable results, it may
become a generally applicable, alternative 4-FB quantification method
that does not require the use of 2-HP (2-hydrazinopyridine) as quantification
reagent.

Although the stability of the conjugates in aqueous
solution above T ≈ 50 °C was found to
be lower than the stability
of free BCA (Figure 5B), the immobilization of de-PG21000-BAH-BCA
inside glass micropipettes and porous glass fiber filters at room
temperature was successful. Similar to the required optimization for
the conjugate preparation, the conditions for the immobilization of
the conjugate had to be elaborated (pH = 7.2, low salt content). For
simple, small-scale flow-through reactor applications, the use of
the “20 μL micropipettes” containing immobilized
BCA (Figure 7) resulted
in higher substrate conversions than in the case of the “200
μL micropipettes”, which clearly confirmed the expected
increase in conversion with increase of surface-to-volume ratio.

So far, BCA is the fifth enzyme which could be immobilized successfully
on silicate surfaces through simple noncovalent de-PG2-BAH-enzyme conjugate adsorption. The enzymes previously used
are HRP,29Aspergillus sp. glucose oxidase (GOD),29Engyodontium album proteinase K,30 and a microbial transglutaminase (from Streptomyces mobaraensis).48 In the last part of the work, we
have shown that this immobilization method can also be applied for
immobilizing BCA in porous glass fiber filters (Figure 2 and Figure 8). Similar filters were already used previously for
the covalent immobilization of trypsin for developing affinity membranes
for chromatographic separation of biomolecules.49 In our work, we used a homemade reactor unit with porous
glass filters containing immobilized BCA as flow-through system (Figure 3). By placing more
than one filter in series, it is possible to either increase the amount
of immobilized enzyme or to use filters containing different types
of enzymes for enzymatic cascade reactions. This latter possibility
will be elaborated in one of our future studies.
