A green
chemical method for the conversion of 3,4-dihydro-β-carbolines
to β-carbolines has been developed using air as the oxidant.
With 15 mol % CuBr2 as the catalyst, 3,4-dihydro-β-carbolines
could be efficiently oxidized to β-carbolines in dimethyl sulfoxide
at room temperature in the presence of 1,8-diazabicyclo[5,4,0]undec-7-ene
(or Et3N). By applying this method, the first total synthesis
of 6-hydroxymetatacarboline D was performed through 12 steps in 22%
overall yield starting from l-5-hydroxy-tryptophan.

1 Introduction
Aromatic
β-carbolines are a kind of extremely important compounds
not only due to their ubiquitousness in natural resources such as
plants,1 marine organisms,2 bacteria,3 fungi,4 and foodstuffs5 but
also due to their diverse biological activities.6 Therefore, development of mild and practical synthetic
methods for aromatic β-carbolines is of considerable interest
and has attracted much attention of chemists.7 Because 3,4-dihydro-β-carbolines can be readily obtained via
Bischler–Napieralski cyclization,8 the aromatization of 3,4-dihydro-β-carbolines is an easy and
good method to obtain
β-carbolines. Normally, 3,4-dihydro-β-carbolines are converted
to β-carbolines via metal-catalyzed (Pd, Ir) dehydrogenation9 or oxidation with stoichiometric oxidants such
as dichlorodicianoquinone,10 KMnO4,11 MnO2,12 S,13 2-iodoxybenzoic acid,14 and pyridinium dichromate.15 However, the dehydrogenation methods employed precious
transition metals as the catalyst and the oxidation methods often
suffered from use of strong oxidants, which sometimes are unfriendly
to the environment. Therefore, development of novel mild, efficient,
and environmentally benign methods for the conversion of 3,4-dihydro-β-carbolines
to aromatic β-carbolines is highly desirable.

On the other
hand, oxygen is an important component of air, which
is one of the most abundant resources on the earth, so air is regarded
as a clean and ecofriendly oxidant, having advantages like safeness,
nontoxicity, cheapness, and ready availability. More and more researchers
have carried out various oxidation reactions using air as the oxidant
during the recent decades.16 Nevertheless,
it is still a very challenging task to use air as the oxidant for
the oxidative conversion of 3,4-dihydro-β-carbolines to β-carbolines
due to its weak oxidizing ability and low solubility in most solvents.
Fortunately, we found that when CuBr2 was used as the catalyst,
3,4-dihydro-β-carbolines could be successfully converted to
β-carbolines by air oxidation. Herein, we describe a very mild
and efficient method for oxidative conversion of 3,4-dihydro-β-carbolines
to β-carbolines.

2 Results and Discussion
Our investigation commenced with the optimization of reaction conditions
for the Cu-catalyzed oxidative conversion of 3,4-dihydro-β-carbolines
to β-carbolines. With oxidative conversion of 3,4-dihydro-1-phenyl-β-carboline 1a to 1-phenyl-β-carboline 2a as the model
reaction, various conditions have been tested, and results are summarized
in Table 1. As can
be seen from Table 1, no reaction happened in the absence of copper catalyst (entry 1);
cupric bromide, cupric chloride, cupric acetate, cupric sulfate, cupric
carbonate, copper(II) oxide, and copper powder have been tested as
catalysts for the model reaction (Table 1, entries 2–8). It was found that
soluble cupric salts (entries 2–4) are much more effective
than insoluble cupric compounds and copper powder (entries 5–8)
and cupric bromide is the best catalyst for the reaction. When 15
mol % CuBr2 was used as the catalyst, the aerobic oxidation
of compound 1a produced desired product 2a in excellent yield at room temperature (entry 2). To obtain β-carboline 2a in high yield, an appropriate base was also needed here
for the reaction (entry 2 vs entries 9–12); the reaction did
not happen at all without a base (entry 13). 1,8-Diazabicyclo[5,4,0]undec-7-ene
(DBU), 1,5-diazabi-cyclo[4,3,0]non-5-ene (DBN), 4-dimthylaminopyridine
(DMAP), pyridine, and triethylamine have been tried for the model
reaction, and it was found that DBU is the most suitable base and
2.0 equiv of DBU was necessary for the reaction. When 0.5 equiv of
DBU was used, it took 4 days for the reaction to be complete. Several
solvents such as dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), N,N-dimethylforamide (DMF), acetonitrile, ethanol, tetrahydrofuran
(THF), dichloromethane, ethyl acetate, and acetone have also been
tested for the model reaction (entries 2 and 14–20), and it
was found that DMSO is the best solvent for the reaction.

Subsequently, we attempted
the CuBr2-catalyzed oxidative
conversion of variously substituted 3,4-dihydro-β-carbolines
to β-carbolines in DMSO, and the results are summarized in Table 2. The scope of the
reaction is very wide; almost all of the tested 3,4-dihydro-β-carbolines
could be smoothly converted to β-carbolines in good to excellent
yields. As can be seen from Table 2, 18 β-carbolines 2a–r were obtained in 80–97% yields, and it was worth
noting that a comparatively strong and expensive base, DBU, should
be used for β-carbolines 2a–h, whereas a comparatively weak and cheap base, Et3N, could
be used for β-carbolines 2i–r probably due to the presence of electron-withdrawing ester groups
(R2 = COOR). We have observed that 3,4-dihydro-β-carbolines
with electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups (COR or COOR) at the C-1
position could undergo oxidation in DMSO at room temperature under
air (O2) to afford β-carbolines in the presence of
DBU without the copper catalyst.17 But
when much weak and cheaper Et3N instead of DBU was used
here for oxidation of 3,4-dihydro-β-carbolines 1i–r, which also contain ester groups at the C-3
position, a cupric salt (CuBr2) should be used as the catalyst
for the reaction.

A possible mechanism for the
above CuBr2-catalyzed oxidative
conversion of 3,4-dihydro-β-carbolines 1 to β-carbolines 2 is proposed in Scheme 1. As can be seen from Scheme 1, two steps might be involved: 3,4-dihydro-β-carbolines 1 would first undergo reversible tautomerization to form enamine
intermediates I-A via migration of double
bonds in the presence of a base and then the unstable enamine intermediates I-A would undergo copper-catalyzed aerobic oxidation
of the C–N single bond to the C=N double bond to afford
β-carbolines 2 according to Adimurthy’s
reports.18

Scheme 1 Possible Mechanism
for the CuBr2-Catalyzed Oxidation of
3,4-Dihydro-β-carbolines to β-Carbolines
To showcase the synthetic utility of the above-described
method
for the CuBr2-catalyzed oxidative conversion of 3,4-dihydro-β-carbolines
to β-carbolines, we applied the methodology to the new total
synthesis of β-carboline alkaloid 6-hydroxymetatacarboline D 3. It was recently discovered in 2013 by Spiteller and his
colleagues19 from fruiting bodies of small
mushrooms, called as Mycena metata,
that are often found in coniferous and deciduous forests.

Nagarajan
and his colleagues have recently reported total syntheses
of metatacarbolines A, C, D, E, F via the Wittig reaction starting
from methyl 1-formyl-β-carboline-3-carboxylate,20 but 6-hydroxymetatacarboline D 3, as the most
abundant β-carboline alkaloid19 in M. metata, has not been synthesized yet; thus, we
herein developed the first total synthesis of 6-hydroxymetatacarboline
D 3 staring from l-5-hydroxy-tryptophan, as
depicted in Scheme 2.

Scheme 2 Total Synthesis of 6-Hydroxymetatacarboline D 3
l-5-Hydroxy-tryptophan
was first treated with 1.0 equiv
of tert-butoxy-carboxylic anhydride and 2.0 equiv
of NaHCO3 at room temperature in DMF under an atmosphere
of N2 to protect the amino group and then the in situ treatment
of intermediate I–B with 1.1 equiv
of K2CO3 and 1.1 equiv of benzyl bromide furnished
compound 4 in 90% yield over two steps. In the following
step, compound 4 was treated with 2.0 equiv of K2CO3 and 1.2 equiv of benzyl bromide in dry acetone
at reflux to afford compound 5 in 87% yield. Removal
of the tert-butoxycarbonyl group of compound 5 via hydrolysis at 60 °C in a mixed solvent of ethyl
acetate and 4 N HCl aqueous solution produced compound 6 in 93% yield. Condensation of compound 6 with 1.1 equiv
of the freshly prepared succinic monochloride methyl monoester at
0 °C in dichloromethane in the presence of 2.0 equiv of triethylamine
furnished amide 7 in 94% yield, which was then exposed
to 3.0 equiv of POCl3 in ethyl acetate at reflux to afford
3,4-dihydro-β-carboline 1r in 71% yield via Bischler–Napieralski
cyclization. According to the above-described CuBr2-catalyzed
oxidation of 3,4-dihydro-β-carbolines to β-carbolines,
compound 1r was treated with 0.15 equiv of cupric bromide
and 2.0 equiv of triethylamine in DMSO at 25 °C under an atmosphere
of air and β-carboline 2r was successfully obtained
in 84% yield.

Next, when compound 2r was treated
with 1.1 equiv
of LiOH·H2O in a mixed solvent of tetrahydrofuran
and water (THF/H2O = 5:1) at room temperature, highly selective
hydrolysis of the methyl ester group occurred smoothly to furnish
acid 8 in 91% yield. When compound 8 was
treated with 1.5 equiv of methyl l-prolinate, 1.2 equiv of
1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylamino-propyl)carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC·HCl),
1.2 equiv of N-hydroxybenzotriazole (HOBt), and 2.0
equiv of diisopropylethylamine (DIPEA) in CH2Cl2 at 0 °C to room temperature, amide 9 was obtained
in 88% yield. Removal of both benzyl groups of compound 9 via Pd/C-catalyzed hydrogenation in methanol at reflux gave acid 10 in an almost quantitative yield. Acid 10 was
then treated with 1.5 equiv of methyl l-threoninate, 1.2
equiv of EDC·HCl, 1.2 equiv of HOBt, and 2.0 equiv of DIPEA in
anhydrous DMF at 0 °C to room temperature to furnish amide 11 in 85% yield.

Finally, compound 11 could
be converted to the targeted
β-carboline alkaloid 6-hydroxymetatacarboline D 3 via simultaneous hydrolysis of two ester groups. When compound 11 was treated with 5.0 equiv of LiOH·H2O
in methanol at 0 °C to room temperature under an atmosphere of
N2 and then was acidified with dilute aqueous solution
of HCl to the isoelectric point (pH ≈ 4.2), compound 3 was thus obtained in 82% yield.

3 Conclusions
In conclusion, we have developed a novel CuBr2-catalyzed
aerobic oxidation of 3,4-dihydro-β-carbolines to β-carbolines.
This method has following advantages: (a) it is mild and environmentally
benign because the process was carried out at room temperature with
air as the clean oxidant; (b) all products have good to excellent
yields; (c) the scope of the reaction is very wide, and it could be
applicable to all of the tested substrates; (d) experiments were easily
performed on a gram scale. Moreover, by applying this method, we have
conducted the first total synthesis of β-carboline alkaloid
6-hydroxymetatacarboline D 3 via 12 steps in 22% overall
yield starting from l-5-hydroxy-tryptophan.

4.1 General Method
1H NMR
and 13C NMR spectra were acquired on a Bruker AM-400 instrument,
and chemical shifts are given on the δ scale as parts per million
with tetramethylsilane as the internal standard. IR spectra were recorded
with a Nicolet Magna IR-550 instrument. Mass spectra were recorded
with a HP1100 LC-MS spectrometer. Melting points were determined on
a Mel-TEMP II apparatus. Column chromatography was performed on silica
gel (Qingdao Ocean Chemical Corp.). All chemicals were analytically
pure.

4.2 General Procedure for CuBr2-Catalyzed
Oxidative Conversion of 3,4-Dihydro-β-carbolines (1) to β-Carbolines (2)
A round-bottom
flask was charged with 3,4-dihydro-β-carboline 1 (3.0 mmol), DMSO (10 mL), DBU or Et3N (6.0 mmol), and
CuBr2 (0.45 mmol). The mixture was stirred under air at
25 °C for a period of time as indicated in Table 2. After the reaction was complete (checked
by thin-layer chromatography (TLC), eluent: EtOAc/hexane = 1:2–1:4),
the mixture was poured into the mixed solution of ammonium hydroxide
(0.5 N, 50 mL) and EtOAc (50 mL). The mixture was stirred for 15 min.
Two phases were separated. The water layer was re-extracted twice
with EtOAc (2 × 20 mL). The organic extracts were combined and
washed twice with brine (2 × 10 mL) and dried over anhydrous
MgSO4. Evaporation of solvent gave a residue, which was
purified by flash chromatography (eluent: EtOAc/CH2Cl2 = 1:4–1:20) to give pure compound 2 as
crystals in 80–97% yields (see Table 2). Characterization data of β-carbolines 2a–r are as follows.

Compound 10 (1.200 g, 2.917
mmol) was dissolved in anhydrous DMF (12 mL), and the solution was
cooled to 0 °C with an ice bath. HOBt (0.473 g, 3.501 mmol),
EDC·HCl (0.671 g, 3.500 mmol), methyl l-threoninate
(0.583 g, 4.378 mmol), and DIPEA (0.754 g, 5.834 mmol) were added
successively. The mixture was stirred at 0 °C for 2 h and then
stirred at room temperature for 10 h. After the reaction was complete
(checked by TLC, eluent: EtOAc), EtOAc (100 mL) and an aqueous solution
of NaHCO3 (5% w/w, 60 mL) were added and the mixture was
then vigorously stirred for 5 min. Two phases were separated with
a separatory funnel, and the aqueous solution was extracted again
with EtOAc (60 mL). Organic extracts were combined and dried over
anhydrous MgSO4. The solvent was evaporated under vacuum
to give the crude product, which was purified by flash chromatography
(eluent: CH2Cl2/CH3OH = 1:10) to
furnish compound 11 (1.306 g, 2.480 mmol) in 85% yield

4.3.10 6-Hydroxymetatacarboline
D (3)
Compound 11 (1.001 g, 1.901
mmol) was dissolved
in MeOH (15 mL) and cooled to 0 °C using an ice bath. LiOH·H2O (0.399 g, 9.508 mmol) was added in batches. The ice bath
was removed, and the mixture was stirred at 0 °C to room temperature
for 5 h under a N2 atmosphere. After the reaction was complete
(checked by TLC, eluent: EtOAc), the solution was concentrated under
vacuum. The residue was dissolved in H2O (6 mL) and cooled
to 0 °C by an ice bath. An aqueous solution of HCl (2 N) was
slowly added until pH ≈ 4.2 (isoelectric point). A pale yellow
solid precipitated, and the mixture was further stirred at 0 °C
for 1 h. The cooled suspension was then filtered, and the filter cake
was washed twice with pure cool water (2 × 3 mL). After drying
under vacuum for 8 h, final product 6-hydroxymetatacarboline D 3 (0.776 g, 1.557 mmol) was obtained in 82% yield as a white
amorphous solid, mp 269–270 °C. [α]D20 = +23.5 (c 1.0, CH3OH). 1H NMR (400 MHz, DMSO-d6) δ
