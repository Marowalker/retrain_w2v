Atomic structures
and electronic properties of MoS2/HfO2 defective
interfaces are investigated extensively for future
field-effect transistor device applications. To mimic the atomic layer
deposition growth under ambient conditions, the impact of interfacial
oxygen concentration on the MoS2/HfO2 interface
electronic structure is examined. Then, the effect on band offsets
(BOs) and the thermodynamic stability of those interfaces is investigated
and compared with available relevant experimental data. Our results
show that the BOs can be modified up to 2 eV by tuning the oxygen
content through, for example, the relative partial pressure. Interfaces
with hydrogen impurities as well as various structural disorders were
also considered, leading to different behaviors, such as n-type doping,
or introducing defect states close to the Fermi level because of the
formation of hydroxyl groups. Then, our results indicate that for
a well-prepared interface the electronic device performance should
be better than that of other interfaces, such as III–V/high-κ,
because of the absence of interface defect states. However, any unpassivated
defects, if present during oxide growth, strongly affect the subsequent
electronic properties of the interface. The unique electronic properties
of monolayer-to-few-layered transition-metal dichalcogenides and dielectric
interfaces are described in detail for the first time, showing the
promising interfacial characteristics for future transistor technology.

1 Introduction
For
the development of future metal–oxide field-effect transistors
(MOSFETs), the conventional silicon transistor channel, which has
already reached its physical limit of scaling, has to be replaced
by an alternative material with higher carrier mobility1 and a high-κ dielectric, providing a higher
gate capacitance for thicker films. For this purpose, III–V
semiconductors, which provide high electron and hole drift mobilities,
have been studied extensively.1−3 The detailed interfacial oxidation
mechanism of Si and SiO2 has been studied from first-principles
molecular dynamics simulations, which explained a scheme that allows
for strain relief during growth, resulting in a high-quality interface.4 It was also evidenced by the very low density
of defects observed at this interface (less than 1 per 104 interface atoms).5

To be a suitable
candidate for use in future field-effect devices,
the material should be thermodynamically stable with the corresponding
high-κ oxide as well as able to unpin the Fermi level with minimal
defect trap density (Dit). Silicon dioxide
has been the dielectric of choice for many field-effect devices, and,
if the present miniaturization trends continue, the projected oxide
thickness should be less than 1 nm, or about five silicon atoms across.6

To date, many studies have been focused
on using hafnium dioxide
(HfO2)-based dielectrics because of their high dielectric
constant (∼20), thermal stability, and sufficient band offsets
(BOs). Despite the enormous effort to realize a low Dit III–V/high-κ interface, these materials
continue to suffer from high defect densities, leading to threshold
voltage shifts, large leakage current, and charge trapping, thus causing
instability of the device. The nature and origin of the defects at
the interface continues to be investigated to optimize the oxide growth
deposition conditions and adopt a suitable defect passivation mechanism.7,8 Recently, there has been substantial interest on two-dimensional
(2D) materials (such as graphene9−11) for electronic device applications
because of their higher carrier mobilities and interfaces devoid of
defect states. However, owing to the intrinsic zero band gap at the
Dirac point, graphene-based layered FETs suffer from high leakage
currents. In addition, tuning the band gap of graphene is not feasible,
which limits its potential applications,12,13 although there has been a recent report on the realization of a
single-layer graphene p–n junction, in which the carrier type
and density in two adjacent regions were locally controlled by electrostatic
gating, opening new techniques for a future graphene-based bipolar
technology.14 Therefore, because of the
several aforementioned limitations, the semiconductor device community
has turned its attention to other 2D or binary quasi-2D materials
beyond graphene, searching for unique electronic, optical, chemical,
and mechanical properties for a wide range of future applications.
Among these, transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), well known for
being used as lubricant additives or coating materials because of
their interesting tribological properties,15−17 have attracted
remarkable interest for device applications. The unique physical properties
of semiconducting TMDs, due to their crystal structure, symmetry,
and thickness (with changes in the interlayer coupling and strain-
and field-dependent modulation of the electronic properties, including
the effects of quantum confinement), enhance their tunabilty and thus
make TMDs promising device materials.18,19

TMDs
have a layered bulk structure that can be exfoliated into
a single-layer semiconducting 2D material with sizable band gaps or
metallic behavior, depending on the type of metal–chalcogen
combination.20−26 Ideally, these materials are anticipated to have a low Dit, as the dangling-bond density should be minimal. They
have been obtained by mechanical or chemical exfoliation as well as
chemical vapor deposition techniques.12,27−31 Two-dimensional MoS2 has been recently investigated for
electronic device applications, showing promising features of a high
ON–OFF current ratio (108), an appreciable carrier
mobility (∼200 cm2/V·s),12 and a higher current density32,33 with a high-κ
gate dielectric. Using a scandium electrode, the carrier mobility
can be further enhanced to ∼700 cm2/V·s, suggesting
a negligible Schottky barrier at the MoS2/Sc interface.34 However, most of the metal contacts on single-layer
MoS2 show the well-known problem of Fermi-level pinning
mechanism,35,36 whereas the metal/oxide interface
seems to be more promising. Although initial reports show mobilities
in the range of 0.1–10 cm2/V·s for exfoliated
monolayer MoS2 on SiO2,9 a recent study claims additional mobility enhancement by reducing
the impurity scattering by high-κ deposition.37 Moreover, quantum transport simulations of an ideal TMD
device indicate that monolayer MoS2 MOSFETs with HfO2 can achieve near-ideal subthreshold slope, suppression of
drain-induced barrier lowering, and gate-induced drain leakage.38 The switching behavior of a TMD transistor degrades
significantly with thicker layers due to diminished gate control.
Monolayer TMDs show the best scalability with the largest ON–OFF
ratios, achieving ON current levels of 450 μA/μm for an
ON–OFF ratio of 105, whereas the bilayer devices
deliver about half of this value exhibiting significant loss of gate
control upon addition of an extra layer to the conducting channel.39 The literature lacks a detailed, atomic-level
investigation of the nature of TMD/high-κ dielectrics interface.
For a detailed understanding and further optimization of TMD-based
electronic devices, it is important to examine in detail the atomic
and electronic structures of TMD/HfO2 interfaces under
different growth conditions.

Here, a lattice-matched monolayer
of the MoS2/HfO2 interface model is developed
and the interface atomic structures
and the corresponding electronic properties are investigated using
density functional theory (DFT) calculations at different levels of
accuracy. The model interface is extensively investigated as a function
of oxygen and hydrogen incorporation, representing different HfO2 atomic layer deposition (ALD) growth conditions on MoS2. The DFT results are compared with previously reported experimental
values from in situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) studies
of HfO2 ALD on bulk MoS2.40 Moreover, we also investigate the influence of several
structural defects and disorders at the interface on the electronic
properties. These studies on MoS2/HfO2 can be
extended to other TMDs and high-κ oxides in an effort to identify
the most promising device material candidates, which might improve
the performance of MoS2 as a device channel material.

2 Results and Discussion
First, we optimized the atomic
structure of the stoichiometric
MoS2/HfO2 interface model and analyzed its electronic
structure. Then, the oxygen concentration at the interface is varied
to investigate the impact on the electronic properties of the interface. Figure 1c shows the variation
of electrostatic potential along a direction perpendicular to the
interface area of the model. The vacuum level is flat, indicating
that there is no electrostatic polarization (no significant charge
transfer) caused by HfO2 deposition on the MoS2 layer. This finding indicates that there is a very weak van der
Waals interaction between the MoS2 monolayer and HfO2. This is consistent with a recent experimental study on the
ALD of HfO2 on the MoS2 surface, where no covalent
bonding between the HfO2 and MoS2 layers was
detected.40 Symmetric potential profiles
are observed for the MoS2 monolayer and HfO2.

Figure 1 Atomic structure of the MoS2/HfO2 interface:
(a) side view and (b) top view of the interface. Hafnium, oxygen,
molybdenum, and sulfur are represented by turquoise, red, purple,
and yellow spheres, respectively. (c) Electrostatic potential profile
perpendicular to the interface area (along the z-direction).
The red lines represent the variation of interfacial potential, whereas
the green line shows the contribution of the isolated MoS2 monolayer. Both potentials are measured with respect to the EVBM.

To understand the electronic properties and to obtain the
BOs between
MoS2 and HfO2 across the interface, the local
density of states (DOS) at bulklike Hf, O, Mo, and S atoms away from
the interface is computed. The computed band gaps of HfO2 are 4 and 6 eV, as obtained with generalized gradient approximation
(GGA) and Heyd, Scuseria, and Ernzerhof (HSE) calculations, respectively
(cf. with the experimental result of 5.9 eV40). For the MoS2/HfO2 interface, GGA calculations
yield a band gap of 1.8 eV, whereas HSE results widen the gap to 2.34
eV. Then, even though the HSE band gap of HfO2 matches
the experimental result much better than the GGA band gap, qualitatively
the BOs of the interface remain relatively unchanged. Moreover, a
trend of band gap decrease when going from single to multilayer MoS2 is observed, with significant changes in the BOs (as will
be discussed later).

Valence band offest (VBO) and conduction
band offset (CBO) obtained
from GGA calculations are ∼1.0 and ∼1.24 eV, respectively,
whereas those obtained from HSE calculations are ∼1.60 and
∼2.0 eV, respectively (Figure S1), and the corresponding experimental values for the bulk interface
are ∼2.67 and ∼2.09 eV (Eg = 1.23 eV for the bulk).40 These results
show that qualitatively and quantitatively the BOs are large enough
to avoid leakage current during the electronic device operation, although
the calculations are for a single MoS2 monolayer; whereas
the available experimental values were obtained for bulk MoS2/HfO2 interface (the changes in the band gap with interface
thickness will be discussed later).

To mimic the oxidizing environment
of the ALD process and to model
the experimental conditions in a more realistic manner, the interfacial
oxygen concentration is varied and the effect on the electronic properties
is investigated. Our calculations show strong effects of the interfacial
oxygen content on the electronic structure of the interface and the
corresponding BOs. Figure 2 shows the atomic structures of the MoS2/HfO2 interface with different amounts of oxygen concentration
(O6 refers to six interfacial O atoms, corresponding to a high oxygen
concentration (1.76 × 1015 O atoms/cm2),
and O3 refers to the lower limit of three interfacial O atoms (0.88
× 1015 O atoms/cm2) within the supercell
of the interface model). Then, the electronic band structures of those
interfaces are investigated to elucidate the impact of the oxygen
concentration on the properties of the interface. Figure 2a–d shows the band structures
of the MoS2/HfO2 interface with different oxygen
concentrations at the interface, with Table S1 summarizing the numerical results. For device applications, the
evaluation of the BOs between MoS2 and HfO2 as
a function of the oxygen concentration is very important, as they
are one of the key parameters that reflect the quantum mechanical
electron tunneling mechanism across the interface. From the analysis
of the variation of the potential across the interface in the previous
section, there is no significant charge transfer for the stoichiometric
interface. In the absence of charge transfer, the BOs are obtained
by the electron affinity (EA) rule or Anderson’s rule.41 In our model, the change of the interfacial
oxygen concentration directly affects the EA. For instance, for the
O3 model, the VBO is always larger than 1 eV (1.8 eV), at the GGA
(HSE) level of approximation, and it increases with O concentration
at the interface.

Figure 2 Electronic band structures of MoS2/HfO2 interfaces
with various oxygen concentrations at the interface: (a) Three interfacial
oxygen atoms (O3), (b) O4, (c) O5, and (d) O6. The zero of the energy
is aligned to the Fermi level. The atomic structure of the MoS2/HfO2 interfaces with various oxygen contents at
the interface is also shown. Hafnium, oxygen, molybdenum, and sulfur
are represented by turquoise, red, purple, and yellow spheres, respectively.

A change in the O concentration
at the interface affects the edge
states of HfO2, but not MoS2, because the valence
band maximum (VBM) of HfO2 is dominated by O 2p states.
A higher O concentration shifts down the VB edge of HfO2 due to the O 2p redistribution at the VBM.42,43 As a consequence, the VBO increases with the amount of interfacial
oxygen. Thus, the VBO can be controlled by varying the oxygen concentration,
a property directly related to the ambient atmospheric oxygen pressure
during the oxide formation.

By controlling the interfacial O
concentration gradually, the VBOs
can be modified up to 1.8 eV (O3 = 1.0 eV; O4 = 1.8 eV; O5 = 2.3 eV;
and O6 = 2.8 eV) at the GGA level of calculation, although a significant
reduction of the CBO is also observed for higher oxygen concentrations
(see Supporting Information). This variation
of the BOs will significantly affect the device performance. However,
the trend showing a bang gap narrowing with the increase of oxygen
concentration remains unchanged. Moreover, we have identified for
the very first time the unique nature of the electronic properties
of few-layered TMD/HfO2 interfaces, by showing the nonidentical
behavior of each TMD individual layer, even for stoichiometric interfaces,
which opens a new possibility of multiconducting channel concept for
FET devices (Figure 3): when going from single-layer to multilayer MoS2, the
electronic properties of the interface are modified, as the layers
are coupled with van der Waals forces through a weak interaction between
S pz states. Approximately, the middle
MoS2 layers control the electronic band edges. Thus, this
unique feature of TMDs shows novel implications for possible TMD-based
devices. Moreover, doping or oxidation will change the top and bottom
layers interfaced with the high-κ dielectric, whereas the layers
beneath will be physically intact, with only the electronic structure
altered, thus showing new and unique functionalities. The layer-projected
DOS (Figure 3) confirms
that the individual layers are not identical in terms of their electronic
structure, affecting the BOs and the band gaps. This finding emphasizes
the unique characteristics of hypothetical TMD-based devices compared
to those of standard Si- or III–V-based electronics.

panel); electronic band gap variation (the energy
values are referred to the vacuum level) (middle panel); and layer-projected
DOS (lower panel).

Besides oxygen impurities,
hydrogen impurities strongly alter the structural and electronic properties
of different host materials into which they are incorporated, affecting
the performance of the electronic devices. During the ALD growth process,
the use of water as an oxygen precursor can provide hydrogen species
in the semiconductor surface. Defect (dangling bond) passivating effects
or dopant passivation behavior are well known in conventional semiconductors.
Here, the presence of H atoms at the interface at several oxygen concentrations
is also examined (Figure S2). Our results
show that for the O3 model an additional H impurity results in n-type
doping behavior, as can be seen from the shifting of the Fermi level
up to the conduction band in the band structure diagram shown in Figure S2a. However, for the O6 model, the H
impurity forms an OH bond, inducing defect states close to the Fermi
level. Then, both H and OH at the interface show a strong impact on
the electronic properties of the interface. Additionally, OH-like
species present at the interface shift the Fermi level toward the
valance band edge and exhibit p-type doping behavior and gap states
(which can be potentially harmful for device applications due to Fermi-level
pinning or charge transfer to/from the defect state), as observed
in Figure S3. It is worthwhile to note
that OH species are expected to be abundant in a standard ALD process.
The incorporation of an H impurity (0.88 × 1015 H
atoms/cm2) on the stoichiometric interface model causes
a defect-state density of about 1.5 × 1014/eV·cm2 close to the band edges.

Interface structural disorder
originated during the growth process
also affects the electronic properties and the thermodynamic stability
of the resulting device. Here, several likely defective interfaces
(Figure S4) are proposed to investigate
how the electronic properties are affected by different atomic arrangements.
The notation O6–O–S refers to a modified O6 interface
model in which oxygen from HfO2 is interchanged with S
from the MoS2 side, as shown in Figure S4a, along with the corresponding electronic band structures
showing additional bands inside the gap of MoS2. The notation
O7–O–S refers to an interface in which the bottom sulfur
atoms of MoS2 are completely replaced by O atoms and the
interfacial O atoms of HfO2 are bonded with S atoms, as
shown in Figure S4b. It can be seen that
these interchange defects caused interface defect states in the band
gap of MoS2 between 1.2 and 1.5 × 1014/eV·cm2, for a defect density of about 1 × 1015 O
or H atoms/cm2.

Defect-state generation can be anticipated
if there is S and O
bonding at the interface or in the TMD surface.44,45 S and O interchange to form Mo–O and S–O bonds, reducing
the band gap significantly. In pristine MoS2, the main
VBM contribution comes from the hybridization of Mo d and S p orbitals,
whereas CBM is mainly composed of Mo d orbitals. In the disordered
system, the hybridization is weakened due to rehybridization at the
interface, inducing gap states in the band gap of MoS2.
Thus, with extrinsic defects present at the interface, gap states
will be induced, resulting in a deleterious impact on the device performance.
The band structure depicted in Figure S4c of a single S–Mo–O layer with HfO2 (Supporting Information) shows that the band gap
narrows substantially, indicating a metallic character (MoO2 is a metal46). The metallic nature of
the contact also indicates the possibility of utilizing such interface
to make contact materials for future TMD-based devices.47

To determine the thermodynamic stability
of the different interface
models, we investigate their formation energies (see Supporting Information for details) as a function of the oxygen
chemical potential (μO), as shown in Figure 4. The formation energy increases
gradually when the oxygen chemical potential changes from O-rich to
O-poor limit, for the O6 to O3 interface models considered in this
study, with the oxygen-rich environment being thermodynamically favorable.

Figure 4 Thermodynamic
stability of the MoS2/HfO2 system
with interfacial impurities. The interface formation energy is given
with respect to the oxygen chemical potential in the following range:
−5.38 eV ≤ μO ≤ 0 eV (setting
the bulk value to zero). The right plot is a zoom of the section corresponding
to experimental conditions around 1 atm.

Figure 4 also
shows
that the thermodynamic stability of the O3 model is higher than that
of O4, O5, and O6 models for a wide range of chemical potentials,
albeit far from realistic ALD conditions. The relative formation energy
of the O6–3H defect model is relatively low in the range close
to a partial pressure of 1 atm, showing that it is stable in O-rich
environments. Besides, as can be seen in Figure S2f, OH species formed at the interface passivate all of the
oxygen dangling bonds. Because of that, the local atomic structure
is distorted compared to that of the pristine interface model, also
inducing a slight distortion in the layers underneath. The stability
of the O3–H model is lower than that of the O3 model, which
means that for a stoichiometric interface, H impurities increase the
formation energy. However, the O7–O–S model is the least
stable among all of the interface models investigated but O7–O
is stable under O-rich conditions. This thermodynamic analysis indicates
that most of the defective surfaces are less likely to be formed.
However, on the contrary, additional hydrogen impurities at the interface
are more likely to be formed compared to that in the stoichiometic
MoS2/HfO2 interface (O3 model).

The study
of the effect of oxygen concentration on the electronic
structure has been reported previously for III–V/high-κ
interfaces.43 It was shown that the most
stable interface corresponds to a high concentration of oxygen and
that the VBOs can be modified up to ∼2 eV by decreasing the
interfacial oxygen content. However, although from different nature,
there are always gap states, due to the presence of dangling bonds
on the III–V semiconductor surface. On the contrary, the inert
nature of TMD monolayers does not induce interfacial gap states, which
can in turn arise from surface defects formed during their synthesis.
Our results have shown that postprocessing could aim to remove or
passivate such defects, thus increasing carrier mobility.48 Also, nonstoichiometric interfaces can also
behave as contacts, exhibiting an Ohmic electrical behavior.49 Interface defect states will affect the carrier
mobility in the electronic device because they act as charge traps.
Indeed, high-density interface states can cause issues such as frequency
dispersion of capacitance, Fermi-level pinning, low electron mobility,
or instability of device operations.50 In
this study, we have identified the preferable interface structures
for specific chemical environments. Such chemical environment can
be monitored and/or controlled through the oxygen partial pressure.
Then, the obtained VBOs for the different interface structures show
the dependence of the BOs and band gaps (which are easily measurable)
on each specific interface structure. Therefore, finally, one can
easily correlate experimentally measured data with defective interfaces,
identifying the origin of any possible defect and/or impurities.

Besides, in electronic devices such as FETs, the gate field controls
the overall operation of the device, by sweeping the Fermi level across
the semiconductor band gap to change the carrier density in the channel
material. However, a significant interface-state density within the
semiconductor band gap can pin the Fermi level to those gap states,
which will ultimately compromise the efficiency of the gate field
control of the transistor. As it has already been shown that a high
density of interface states is the primary cause for the poor device
performance of III–V/dielectric interfaces, the analysis of
possible defect states and their origin for TMD and high-κ dielectric
interfaces becomes crucial to prevent poor device performance, highlighting
again the importance of defect passivation or preparing defect-free
interfaces.

3 Conclusions
In conclusion, in this
study, we have shown that the BOs of MoS2/HfO2 interfaces change with increasing interfacial
oxygen content, indicating their dependence on the oxide growth environment.
For the stoichiometric, defect-free MoS2/HfO2 interface, no charge transfer between HfO2 and MoS2 is observed. However, disorder and defects at the interface
can introduce gap states, which would be harmful for device applications
due to the subsequent charge transfer or Fermi-level pinning. Thus,
the interfacial oxygen content significantly affects the thermodynamic
stability and the BOs of the interface. Furthermore, interfacial hydrogen
impurities are also shown to have a strong effect on the interfacial
stability and the corresponding VBO. These DFT results of MoS2/HfO2 interface properties are qualitatively consistent
with those obtained from in situ XPS studies of HfO2 ALD
on bulk MoS2 and highlight the importance of fabricating
defect-free interfaces for novel, TMD-based device applications.

4 Methods and Calculation Details
First-principles calculations
are performed on the basis of DFT51−53 with plane wave basis
set and projector-augmented wave pseudopotentials,54,55 implemented in the Vienna ab initio simulation package.51,56 The electronic wave functions are represented by plane wave basis
with a cutoff energy of 500 eV. The exchange correlation interactions
are incorporated as a functional of the GGA.57−59 Knowing the
underestimation of the band gaps obtained from standard GGA calculations,
we also used the hybrid functional proposed by Heyd, Scuseria, and
Ernzerhof (HSE), in which the short-range part of the exchange functional
is represented by a (fixed) combination of GGA and Hartree–Fock
contributions, whereas the long-range part and the correlation functional
are described by the GGA.60

To investigate
the MoS2/HfO2 interface, an
interface model starting with a S-terminated MoS2 surface
and an O-terminated HfO2 (111) surface, with a lattice
mismatch less than 1%, is constructed, as shown in Figure 1a. This interface model contains
5 atomic layers of Hf and 10 atomic layers of O, to minimize the quantum
size effects. Although dielectric materials typically become amorphous
after annealing at high temperatures to reduce defect formation, the
local Hf–O bonding is more important than long-range order
for interface engineering. Therefore, the 15 dielectric layers considered
represent a good model system for this type of interfaces.42,43 Periodically repeated slabs are used to model the interface. Each
periodic slab is separated by 16 Å of vacuum to avoid interaction
between the two surfaces of the slab due to the periodic boundary
conditions. In our calculations, the atoms are allowed to relax, whereas
the cell size is kept fixed after optimization of the unit cell. A
Γ-centered 6 × 6 × 1 k-point within
the Monkhorst–Pack scheme61 mesh
is used in the self-consistent field (SCF) calculations, and a 12
× 12 × 1 k-point mesh is used for DOS calculations.
An SCF dipole correction is used to cancel spurious electric fields
that may be induced by the periodic boundary conditions of the interface
model. The energy and forces are converged until tolerance values
of 10–4 eV and 0.01 eV/Å, respectively.
