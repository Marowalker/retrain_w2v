We report on the
ability
of a chemically synthesized anticancer peptide, SVS-1, to promote
the
rapid uptake of gold nanorods (AuNRs) and gold nanoparticles (AuNPs)
by live HeLa cells. For this, AuNPs and AuNRs, surface ligated with
a multicoordinating polymer that presents several amine groups per
ligand, are simultaneously reacted with SVS-1 and Texas-Red dye; the
latter allows fluorescence visualization of the nanocrystals. Using
epifluorescence microscopy, we find that incubation of the SVS-1-conjugated
AuNPs and AuNRs with a model cancer cell line yields extended staining
throughout the cell cytoplasm, even at low conjugate concentrations
(∼0.1 nM). Furthermore, uptake is specific to the SVS-1-conjugated
nanocrystals. Additional endocytosis inhibition experiments, where
cells have been incubated with the conjugates at 4 °C or in the
presence of endocytic inhibitors, show that significant levels of
conjugate uptake persist. These results combined indicate an uptake
mechanism that does not necessarily rely on endocytosis, a promising
finding with implications for the use of nanomaterials in the field
of biology and nanomedicine.

Introduction
Over the past two decades
bottom-up solution phase growth has allowed
researchers access to a wide range of colloidal nanostructures made
of homogeneous noble metal cores, with great control over size, shape,
and stoichiometry.1−5 The designed nanocolloids also feature several unique photophysical
and chemical properties not shared by their bulk parent materials,
or at the molecular scale.4,5 One of the most attractive
characteristics of gold nanomaterials is the size- and shape-dependent
localized surface plasmon resonance absorption.2,6,7 This endows them with enhanced light absorption,
which can be tuned from the visible to the near infrared region of
the optical spectrum, along with strong light-scattering properties.7−9 These characteristics have motivated several groups to integrate
these materials in biomedical applications.4,9−17 For instance, the strong optical absorption followed by nonradiative
energy dissipation exhibited by gold nanocolloids has been exploited
to develop them as platforms for photothermal therapy.4,18−20 Furthermore, the inertness of the core material,
ease of surface functionalization, and low cytotoxicity have been
exploited to design and fabricate nanocarriers for therapeutic delivery,
including drugs and nucleic acids.21,22 Gold nanocolloids
have also been actively explored in an array of additional applications
ranging from dark field microscopy to optical coherence and photoacoustic
tomography imaging.23−26

Use of these nanomaterials for in vivo applications requires
access
to effective means for delivering them efficiently into live cells
and tissues.27−29 Intracellular uptake has been investigated in several
studies, where groups have explored several receptor-mediated internalization
strategies. A number of cell penetrating, often arginine-rich, peptides
(CPPs) have been investigated as vehicles to promote the cellular
uptake of nanocolloids. These peptides have primarily been derived
from the proteins of various viruses, including SV40 large T and HIV
1 TAT protein.30,31 However, most if not all those
studies have shown that uptake of the CPP-coupled nanocolloids (e.g.,
luminescent quantum dots, gold as well as other inorganic cores) is
primarily controlled by endocytic uptake mechanisms, with internalization
efficiency being affected by properties, such as colloid size, structure
of the CPP and type of cells used. Researchers have also wrestled
with issues ranging from inefficient intracellular uptake to dominance
of endocytosis, which tends to yield platforms that are sequestered
inside vesicles within mammalian cells.32,33 Indeed, most
of those studies reported that nanoparticles (NPs) functionalized
with arginine-rich peptides or biomolecules like transferrin, herceptin
antibody, and folic acid were taken up by cells via endocytosis.28,30,34 Overall, homogeneous delivery
of NP cargos into the cytosol of live cells remains an unrealized
milestone toward the translation of NP-based therapeutic and diagnostic
tools into the clinic. Thus, exploring new strategies that can enhance
uptake of gold nanomaterials, shorten the required incubation time
and concentration used, while reducing endosomal sequestration (the
hallmark of endocytotic delivery) is very much needed.

In this
report, we detail the use of SVS-1 peptide, a de novo designed
anticancer peptide with the sequence KVKVKVKVDPPTKVKVKVK-NH2, to facilitate the rapid and efficient delivery of gold colloids,
namely, spherical nanoparticles (AuNPs) and large nanorods (AuNRs)
inside HeLa cells. This peptide was designed to bind to the negatively
charged surfaces of cancer cells, fold to form a hairpin structure,
and induce their lytic destruction.35,36 However, when
cells are incubated with concentrations of SVS-1 that are below its
IC50 (half-maximal inhibitory concentration), the peptide
does not affect the cell viability. Instead, the peptide promotes
entry, via a process involving membrane translocation, into the cytoplasm.37 Motivated by these findings, we wanted to explore
the potential of SVS-1 to mediate the rapid translocation of nanoscale
gold colloids inside live cells. Several copies of the SVS-1 peptide
along with several Texas-Red (TXR) dyes were conjugated to both AuNPs
and AuNRs. Here, the TXR dye was introduced to allow fluorescence
visualization of the nanocolloids inside the cells, since these Au
nanocrystals are nonfluorescent. We have investigated the effectiveness
of the SVS-1-faciliated intracellular uptake of the nanocolloids by
HeLa cells, using fluorescence microscopy. We found that SVS-1 mediates
rapid and pronounced uptake of AuNPs and AuNRs even at low concentrations,
nanomolar for AuNPs and sub-nanomolar for AuNRs. Additionally, incubation
of the cells with the nanomaterials in the presence of endocytic inhibitors
indicates that the cell entry mechanism cannot be simply attributed
to common endocytic pathways.

Results and Discussion
Two sets
of gold nanocrystals, namely, AuNPs (∼10 nm in
diameter) and AuNRs (109 nm × 20 nm, aspect ratio of ∼5),
have been used to test the capacity of the SVS-1 peptide to promote
the delivery of such large colloids into live cells. We started with
oleylamine-stabilized AuNPs and cetyltrimethylammonium bromide/sodium
oleate (CTAB/NaOL)-stabilized AuNRs, which have been grown following
literature protocols.5,38 Transmission electron microscopy
(TEM) images of these nanocrystals are shown in Figure 1. The native ligands on the nanocrystals
were exchanged with a multicoordinating polymer coating presenting
several imidazole anchors along with several poly(ethylene glycol)
(PEG) blocks, where a fraction of those blocks is amine-terminated
(reactive), whereas the other is methoxy-terminated (inert), histamine
(His)–poly(isobutylene-alt-maleic anhydride)
(PIMA)–PEG–OCH3/NH2.39 The use of a multidentate polymer coating instead
of a monodentate ligand (e.g., monothiol–PEG) is advantageous,
in particular, when colloids with large surface areas are involved,
such as is the case for the AuNRs used here. Such coating also yields
nanomaterials with substantially better colloidal stability and reduced
nonspecific interactions.40,41 The polymer presents
several amines per ligand, which allows for the simultaneous conjugation
of multiple peptides and other functionalities to a nanocrystal. We
estimate that based on the ligand structure, size of the nanocrystal,
and the fraction of PEG–NH2 blocks inserted in a
ligand, there are ∼4000 amines per AuNR and ∼170 amines
per AuNP.42 Approximately, 50% of the available
amine groups was functionalized with maleimide using N-hydroxysuccinamide-3-(3-methyl-2,5-mioxo-2,5-dihydro-1H-pyrrol-1-yl)propionic acid (NHS-ester maleimide). The maleimide
groups were then coupled to the N-terminal cysteine of a modified
SVS-1 peptide (CGGKVKVKVKVDPPTKVKVKVK-NH2),
which forms a stable thioether linkage between the nanocrystal and
the peptide (see Figure 1A).43 The remaining fraction of amines
was coupled to Texas-Red NHS ester, to afford fluorescence tracking
of the conjugated AuNPs and AuNRs. The absorption and emission profiles
of the TXR-labeled AuNP-SVS-1 and AuNR-SVS-1 conjugates are shown
in Figure 2. The emission
profiles fall largely outside the absorption ranges (bands) of both
colloids. In addition, rather large photoluminescence intensities
are generated from these dispersions, which is a direct result of
coupling large numbers of TXR per nanocrystal; this allows one to
circumvent (and reduce) the effects of fluorescence quenching of dye
emission by proximal metallic nanostructures.44 Additional details on the ligand exchange and conjugate preparation
are provided in the Experimental Section.

is shown. (B) TEM images of AuNPs and AuNRs used in this study.

Figure 2 Absorption and emission spectra (normalized
with respect to the
peak values) collected from TXR-labeled AuNP-SVS-1 and AuNR-SVS-1
dispersions. Samples were excited at 580 nm. Note that the dye contribution
to the AuNP or AuNR absorption (over the range 550–600 nm)
is very small (essentially negligible), a property that can be largely
attributed to the very large extinction coefficient of the metal nanocolloids
compared to that of TXR.

The effectiveness of the SVS-1 peptide to facilitate intracellular
delivery of AuNPs and AuNRs into live cells was first tested by incubating
the colloid conjugates with eukaryotic mammalian HeLa cells at different
concentrations for 1 h at 37 °C. The set of panels in Figure 3 shows epifluorescence
images collected from cells incubated with AuNP-SVS-1/TXR conjugates
at different concentrations (2, 4, and 5 nM with respect to AuNPs).
Shown are differential interference contrast (DIC) images of the cell
morphology, blue 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) staining
of the nuclei, red florescence of the TXR dye (i.e., AuNP-conjugates),
along with the merged fluorescence images. Figure 4 shows images for cell cultures incubated
with AuNR-SVS-1/TXR conjugates (at 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3 nM with respect
to AuNRs), namely, DIC images, epifluorescence of the DAPI-stained
nuclei (blue), red staining ascribed to the AuNP-TXR emission, together
with the merged images (right panels). Two sets of control experiments
probing cellular uptake of the AuNPs and AuNRs in the absence of peptides
were also carried out. In the first set, the cells were incubated
with dye-labeled nanocolloids (i.e., no SVS-1), AuNP-TXR at 5 nM and
AuNR-TXR at 0.3 nM. The second set probed the cellular uptake of pure
AuNP/AuNRs (i.e., nanocolloids in the absence of SVS-1 and TXR) using
5 nM of AuNPs and 0.3 nM of AuNRs.

(nuclei) and Texas-Red epifluorescence images of control cells and
cells incubated with varying concentrations of nanoconjugates of AuNP-TXR
(5 nM) and AuNP-SVS-1 (2–5 nM) for 1 h at 37 °C. The Texas-Red
dye coupled to AuNP-conjugates allowed visualization of the Au nanocrystal
distribution inside the cells. Scale bar ∼ 10 μm.

into HeLa
cells. Shown are the (DIC), DAPI (nuclei), Texas-Red and merged DAPI
(nuclei) and Texas-Red epifluorescence images of control cells and
cells incubated with varying concentrations of nanoconjugates of AuNR-TXR
(0.3 nM) and AuNR-SVS-1 (0.1–0.3 nM) for 1 h at 37 °C.
The Texas-Red dye allowed visualization of the Au nanocrystal distribution
inside the cells. Scale bar ∼ 10 μm.

For both sets of conjugates, the collected images show that
significant
levels of uptake are observed even at the lowest concentrations used
for SVS-1-conjugated AuNPs and AuNRs (2 nM for AuNPs and 0.1 nM for
AuNRs). Furthermore, the images show a homogeneous red staining across
the cell volumes excluding the nuclei; this suggests that following
uptake the conjugates do not penetrate the cell nucleus. In comparison,
images collected from control experiments clearly show that no internalization
was measured for cells exposed to dispersions of nanocrystals alone
(no TXR and no peptide) or TXR-labeled nanocrystals (AuNP-TXR or AuNR-TXR).
The pronounced uptake of only peptide-coupled nanocrystals proves
the effectiveness of SVS-1 in delivering AuNPs or AuNRs into live
cells; notably a pronounced uptake was measured at sub-nanomolar concentrations
for AuNR-conjugates. The pronounced uptake is likely due to an increased
number of peptides per nanocrystal-SVS-1 conjugate (i.e., high valence),
which is facilitated by the high number of amine groups presented
on the AuNPs/AuNRs. The latter results from a combination of large
surface areas of the colloids and the ability to tune the ligand stoichiometry.39 For instance, the AuNPs and AuNRs have substantially
larger surface areas than luminescent quantum dots, whereas the polymer
presents ∼6 amines per ligand.45 We anticipate based on the number of amine groups per nanocrystals
that there are up to ∼80 SVS-1 per AuNP- and over ∼1000
peptide per AuNR-conjugate, if we assume that approx. half of the
amine groups has been coupled to peptides.

The above results
combined indicate that the SVS-1 peptide is very
effective in delivering the Au nanocrystals into live cells. Additionally,
the red staining of the TXR-labeled AuNP-SVS-1 or AuNR-SVS-1 conjugates
is homogenous, suggesting that endocytosis may not be a dominant mechanism
in their uptake. To identify whether or not the observed peptide-mediated
uptake of the AuNPs and AuNRs is promoted by endocytic pathways, additional
internalization studies were conducted in the presence of three common
physiological and pharmacological inhibitors of endocytosis. First,
the temperature of the cell culture was maintained at 4 °C for
40 min to halt endocytic activity in the cells, followed by incubation
with the AuNP-SVS-1 or AuNR-SVS-1 conjugates for another 40 min. This
experiment allowed us to test the effects of reducing all cells activities,
including metabolic activities and endocytosis, which is expected
to occur when the temperature of the cultures is lowered from 37 to
4 °C, eliminating endocytosis as an uptake process.46,47 The cells were fixed and then imaged using epifluorescence microscopy.
In the second set of experiments, we tested the effects of introducing
two chemical inhibitors of endocytotic uptake. In one experiment,
the cultures were first pretreated with sodium azide (NaN3, 10 mM) and 2-deoxy-d-glucose (50 mM) for 30 min, followed
by incubation with AuNP-SVS-1 or AuNR-SVS-1 conjugates for 40 min,
and then imaged. In the other experiment, the cells were initially
incubated with a hypertonic sucrose solution (0.4 M) for 1 h, then
with the conjugates for 40 min, followed by fluorescence imaging.
Incubation with 2-deoxy-d-glucose and NaN3 is
expected to inhibit glycolysis and mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation,
respectively, which leads to impairment of adenosine triphosphate
(ATP) production (thus altering the active process of endocytosis).37 Conversely, exposing the cell culture to a hypertonic
sucrose solution specifically inhibits the clathrin-mediated endocytosis.48−50 The panels shown in Figure 5A,B indicate that significant red staining from the AuNP-
and AuNR-conjugates is still measured inside the cells under all three
endocytosis inhibition conditions tested. These results suggest that
inhibiting endocytosis (by reducing all cells activities, ATP-depletion,
and blocking clathrin-mediated uptake) has little to no effect on
the levels of cell staining facilitated by decorating the AuNPs and
AuNRs with several copies of SVS-1. They also agree with previous
findings, which have indicated that incubating cells with SVS-1 at
subtoxic concentrations promotes uptake of the peptide into cells
via primarily physical translocative mechanisms.36 This peptide is thus potentially promising and should be
further explored as a means of delivering various nanomaterials inside
live cells, likely via membrane translocation.

images of HeLa cells incubated with AuNP-SVS-1 (2 nM) and AuNR-SVS-1
(0.2 nM) conjugates for 40 min at 4 °C (top panels), in the presence
of sodium azide (middle panels) and in the presence hypertonic sucrose
solution (bottom panels). The cell nuclei were DAPI stained. Scale
bar ∼ 10 μm.

We would like to stress that incubation of the HeLa cells
with
the gold nanocolloids while yielding high levels of staining across
the cell volume (excluding the nucleus), it did not alter the viability
of the cell culture as confirmed using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide (MTT) assay. The cells were first incubated with the nanocolloids
for 24 h at concentrations ranging from 0.25 to 4 nM for AuNP-SVS-1
(or AuNPs) and from 0.0125 to 0.2 nM for AuNRs or AuNP-SVS-1 conjugates.
After that the cultures were incubated with MTT for 3 h, and then
dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) was added followed by collection of the
absorption data. The viability data reported in Figure 6 clearly show that no changes in the fraction
of healthy cells are measured over the range of concentrations tested.
Combined with the intact morphology of the cells shown in the DIC
images (Figures 3 and 4), these viability data indicate that the presence
of either set of conjugates does not induce any measurable changes
in the cell health or functions. This result is consistent with previous
findings reported in reference,36 where
it was shown that incubation of cells with pure SVS-1 at concentration
smaller than IC50 value did not affect the cell viability.

Conclusions
We have tested the capacity
of a lysine-rich 18 amino acid peptide,
SVS-1, initially designed as an anticancer peptide, to deliver AuNPs
and AuNRs into live mammalian cells, via potentially direct translocation
through the plasma membrane. Our results combining fluorescence imaging
and endocytosis inhibition measurements indicate that this membrane-active
peptide can promote a pronounced intracellular delivery of AuNPs and
AuNRs. We found that delivery of both cargos is not affected by conjugate
concentration, implying that uptake is rapid. Moreover, uptake of
both sets of nanomaterials persists under inhibition conditions that
drastically limit endocytosis. This strongly suggests a mechanism
of cell entry that involves direct translocation across the membrane.
These findings are promising and indicate that SVS-1 (and its derivatives)
could address the limitations currently encountered in delivering
various nanomaterials into live cells. Our approach offers a direct
and more effective strategy for the intracellular delivery of nanoconjugates
than other routes that rely on endocytic uptake, followed by endosome/lysosome
disruption to access the cytoplasm. These approaches tend to release
the content of those endo/lysosomes in the cytosol, which may negatively
affect the cell health. Furthermore, our findings may open up new
opportunities for intracellular biosensing applications using high-resolution
TEM imaging of cells treated with peptide-functionalized nanocrystals,
given the high electronic contrast offered by the Au cores. We are
presently testing this approach and hope to report on our findings
in the future.

Experimental Section
Solid-Phase Peptide Synthesis
The cysteine-modified
SVS-1 peptide with the sequence CGGKVKVKVKVDPPTKVKVKVK-NH2 was synthesized on PL-Rink resin using an automated ABI 433A
peptide synthesizer via fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl-based solid-phase
peptide chemistry with HCTU activation. The peptide was cleaved from
the resin and deprotected under argon atmosphere using a trifluoroacetic
acid (TFA)/thioanisole/1,2-ethanedithiol/anisole (90:5:3:2) mixture
for 2 h. The crude product was precipitated with cold diethyl ether
and lyophilized. Purification of the compound relied on reverse-phase
high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using a system equipped
with a semipreparative Vydac C18 column. A solvent mixture made of
A (0.1% TFA in water) and B (0.1% TFA in 9:1 acetonitrile/water) was
used for HPLC purification, with a linear gradient of 0–100%
solvent B applied over 100 min. The solution was then lyophilized,
yielding the product, and the purity was verified by analytical HPLC-mass
spectrometry.

Polymer Ligand Synthesis
The precursors,
including
H2N–PEG750–OCH3 and
H2N–PEG600–NH2, used
for synthesizing the polymers were prepared in our laboratory following
the procedures described in previous publications.51,52 The H2N–PEG600–NH(Boc) precursor
was prepared from H2N–PEG600–NH2 by reacting one amine with Boc2O, following the
protocol reported in reference.53 The amine-functionalized
polymer, His–PIMA–PEG–OCH3/NH2 (50% His, 35% PEG–OCH3 and 15% PEG–NH2), was prepared following the protocol reported in our recent
work.39 Briefly, 0.1 g of poly(isobutylene-alt-maleic anhydride), PIMA, was dissolved in 5 mL of DMF
and added to a 25 mL three-neck round-bottom flask. The solution was
purged with nitrogen and heated to 40 °C using an oil bath. Histamine
(0.036 g) dissolved in DMF (1 mL) was added dropwise to the PIMA solution
through a syringe, followed by addition of a DMF solution (2 mL) containing
H2N–PEG750–OCH3 (0.17
g) and H2N–PEG600–NH(Boc) (0.067
g). The reaction mixture was stirred overnight at 40 °C, and
then the solvent was removed under vacuum. The residual product was
dissolved in tetrahydrofuran (5 mL) followed by addition of HCl solution
(0.5 mL, 4 M in dioxane) for Boc-deprotection. The mixture was stirred
for 1 h at room temperature, and then the solvents were removed under
vacuum. The polymer was dissolved in methanol, to which a solution
of NaOH in methanol (0.1 g/mL) was added dropwise to neutralize the
acid. The solvent was removed under vacuum, and then 5 mL of chloroform
was added to precipitate the salts. One round of centrifugation was
applied to remove the salts, followed by solvent removal under vacuum
to yield the final His–PIMA–OCH3/NH2 polymer.

AuNP and AuNR Growth and Ligand Exchange
The starting
oleylamine-capped AuNPs (∼10 nm in diameter) were synthesized
following the protocol described previously in reference.38 For ligand exchange, 300 μL of oleylamine-capped
AuNPs dispersed in hexane were precipitated with ethanol, and the
precipitate was resuspended in 300 μL of CHCl3. Separately,
a ligand solution was prepared by dissolving His–PIMA–PEG–OCH3/NH2 (15 mg) in 300 μL of CHCl3 and then added to the AuNP dispersion. The mixture was left stirring
overnight at 50 °C. The AuNPs were precipitated with excess hexane
and then pelleted by centrifugation for 5 min at 3600 rpm. This step
was repeated one more time, and the AuNPs were dried under vacuum,
redispersed in deionized (DI) water, and then passed through a 0.45
μm syringe filter (Millipore, Billerica, MA). Further purification
to remove excess polymer ligands was carried out by applying three
rounds of concentration/dilution using a centrifugal membrane filtration
device (MW cutoff = 50 kDa). The final concentration of the AuNP dispersion
was determined from the absorbance value at 520 nm using an extinction
coefficient of 9.55 × 107 M–1cm–1.3,54

The gold nanorods (109
nm × 20 nm) were prepared by seeded growth in a surfactant mixture
containing hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) and sodium oleate
(NaOL), following the strategy developed by Murray and co-workers.5 Ligand exchange of CTAB/NaOL-coated AuNRs with
His–PIMA–PEG–OCH3/NH2 was
performed in aqueous phase. AuNR stock dispersion (300 μL, ∼3
nM) was centrifuged at 7000 rpm for 5 min to remove excess CTAB and
NaOL, and the pellet was resuspended in 300 μL of DI water.
Subsequently, 15 mg of His–PIMA–PEG–OCH3/NH2 dissolved in 500 μL of phosphate buffer (pH
8) was added to the AuNR dispersion, and the mixture was stirred overnight
at 50 °C. The aqueous solution was then passed through a 0.45
μm syringe filter (Millipore, Billerica, MA), and excess ligand
was removed by applying two rounds of concentration/dilution using
a centrifugal membrane filtration device as described above. The final
concentration of the AuNR dispersion was determined from the absorbance
value at 1034 nm using an extinction coefficient of 7.8 × 109 M−1cm−1.23,55

Preparation of AuNP-SVS-1/Texas-Red Conjugates (AuNP-SVS-1/TXR)
In a typical preparation, 0.046 mg of SVS-1 peptide, containing
a CGG motif at its N-terminus to allow for thiol-mediated conjugation,
was dissolved in 150 μL of Tris-buffered saline (TBS) (pH 7.3)
and mixed with 2 μL of 6.98 mM solution of tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine
(TCEP); the TCEP-to-peptide molar ratio was ∼0.5. This mixture
was stirred for 15 min at room temperature. In a separate glass vial,
150 μL of ligand-exchanged AuNPs (0.22 μM) were dispersed
in 200 μL of phosphate buffer (pH 7.5, 20 mM). To this, a mixture
of 1.5 μL of 7.1 mM NHS ester maleimide solution (in DMSO) and
58 μL of 265 μM NHS-ester Texas-Red (in DMSO) was added.
The reaction mixture was stirred for ∼30 min at room temperature
after which excess NHS ester maleimide and dye were removed by applying
one round of dilution/concentration with TBS (pH 7.3) using a membrane
filtration device (MW cutoff = 50 kDa). The purified AuNP-TXR/maleimide
dispersion was added to the peptide–TCEP mixture, and the final
volume was adjusted to 400 μL with TBS (pH 7.3). The solution
was incubated for another ∼3 h at room temperature while stirring.
The AuNP-SVS-1/TXR conjugates were separated from byproducts and unbound
peptide via size-exclusion chromatography using a PD-10 column. The
conjugates were stored at 4 °C until further use.

Preparation
of AuNR-SVS-1/Texas-Red Conjugates (AuNR-SVS-1/TXR)
We follow
the same steps described above to prepare the AuNR-SVS-1/TXR
conjugates. Briefly, SVS-1 peptide (0.1 mg) was dissolved in 150 μL
of TBS (pH 7.3) and mixed with 3 μL of 6.98 mM TCEP (TCEP-to-peptide
molar ratio ∼0.5), and the mixture was stirred for 15 min at
room temperature. In a separate glass vial, 200 μL of ligand-exchanged
AuNRs (5.8 nM) was dispersed in 300 μL of phosphate buffer (pH
7.5, 20 mM). A mixture made of 6.5 μL of 7.1 mM NHS ester maleimide
solution (in DMSO) and 175 μL of 265 μM NHS-ester Texas-Red
(in DMSO) was added. The reaction mixture was stirred for ∼30
min at room temperature followed by removal of excess NHS-ester maleimide
and dye by applying one round of dilution/concentration with TBS (pH
7.3) as done above. The purified AuNR-TXR-maleimide dispersion was
added to the peptide–TCEP solution, and the volume was adjusted
to 400 μL by adding TBS (pH 7.3). The mixture was reacted for
another ∼3 h at room temperature. The AuNR-SVS-1/TXR conjugates
were purified from byproducts and unbound peptide via size-exclusion
chromatography using a PD-10 column. The conjugates were stored at
4 °C until further use.

Cell Culture and Inhibition Experiments
Human cervical
carcinoma (HeLa) cells were acquired from the Florida State University
cell culture facility. The cell cultures were grown at 37 °C
under humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere in complete growth medium
(Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium, DMEM) supplemented with
10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, l-glutamine, sodium pyruvate,
1% (v/v) antibiotic–antimycotic 100×, and 1% (v/v) nonessential
amino acid solution 100×. For incubation experiments, 7 ×
104 cells were seeded onto 12 mm round microcover glasses
in a 24-well microplate (CellStar, VWR), and then incubated overnight
to allow for cell attachment. For uptake studies, the cell cultures
were incubated with dispersions of the nanocrystal-TXR or nanocrystal-SVS-1/TXR
conjugates, prepared in serum-free DMEM media at the desired concentrations.
After incubation, the cells were washed three times with TBS buffer,
fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde, and then stained with DAPI to visualize
the nuclei.

The endocytosis inhibition experiments were carried
out using cells, which have been cultured overnight in 24-well microplate
as done above. Three sets of inhibition experiments were carried out.
(1) The cell cultures were preincubated at 4 °C for 40 min prior
to mixing with the AuNP/NR-conjugates.47 (2) ATP-depletion experiments were carried out by preincubating
the cells in glucose and serum-free media containing 10 mM sodium
azide and 50 mM 2-deoxy-d-glucose for 30 min prior to exposure
to AuNP/NR-conjugates.56 (3) The cells
were preincubated in serum-free media containing 0.45 M sucrose for
1 h; this is expected to selectively prevent uptake promoted by clathrin-mediated
endocytosis.57 The pretreated cells were
washed with serum-free media followed by incubation with the conjugates
at the required concentrations for 40 min. The cultures were then
washed, fixed, and stained with DAPI, as described above.

Fluorescence
Imaging Experiments
An Inverted Nikon
Eclipse Ti Microscope equipped with a color CoolSNAP HQ2 CCD camera
(available at the FSU Department of Chemistry) was utilized to collect
the fluorescence images of the various labeled and fixed cell cultures.
Excitation of the cultures was provided by a Xe lamp, whereas the
fluorescence images were collected using a 60× objective (Nikon)
and a set of filter cubes (Chroma Technology, Rockingham, VT). These
include a DAPI cube (with 340–380 nm excitation and 435–485
nm emission) to visualize the nuclei and a Texas-Red HYQ cube (with
532–587 nm excitation and 608–683 nm emission) for visualization
of the AuNP-SVS-1/TXR and AuNR-SVS-1/TXR conjugates.
