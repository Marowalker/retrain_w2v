As a p-type multifunctional semiconductor,
CuSe nanostructures
show great promise in optoelectronic, sensing, and photocatalytic
fields. Although great progress has been achieved, controllable synthesis
of CuSe nanosheets (NSs) with a desirable spacial orientation and
open frameworks remains a challenge, and their use in supercapacitors
(SCs) has not been explored. Herein, a highly vertically oriented
and interpenetrating CuSe NS film with open channels is deposited
on an Au-coated polyethylene terephthalate substrate. Such CuSe NS
films exhibit high specific capacitance (209 F g–1) and can be used as a carbon black- and binder-free electrode to
construct flexible, symmetric all-solid-state SCs, using polyvinyl
alcohol–LiCl gel as the solid electrolyte. A device fabricated
with such CuSe NS films exhibits high volumetric specific capacitance
(30.17 mF cm–3), good cycling stability, excellent
flexibility, and desirable mechanical stability. The excellent performance
of such devices results from the vertically oriented and interpenetrating
configuration of CuSe NS building blocks, which can increase the available
surface and facilitate the diffusion of electrolyte ions. Moreover,
as a prototype for application, three such solid devices in series
can be used to light up a red light-emitting diode.

Introduction
Supercapacitors (SCs)
have been playing an important role in high-performance
power sources because of their fast dynamic response, high power density,
and excellent cycling stability in comparison with secondary batteries
and dielectric capacitors.1−4 With the ever-increasing demand for developing flexible
energy storage devices to use in portable and wearable electronics,
flexible all-solid-state SCs have garnered considerable attention
in the recent times.5−8 For this purpose, the key lies in finding proper electroactive materials
with good mechanical properties and integrating them into special
device configurations. During the past decades, two kinds of electroactive
materials were widely studied: one is the carbon-based materials (e.g.,
carbon nanotubes,9,10 activated carbon,11,12 graphene,13−15 etc.), and the other is the transition metal oxides/hydroxides
[(e.g., RuO2,16−18 V2O5,19 MnO2,20−22 Ni(OH)2,23−25 Co(OH)2,26 etc.]. These electroactive
materials have their merits and drawbacks. The former ones are very
stable, but their specific capacitances are relatively low owing to
the limitation of electronic double-layer energy storage mechanism.
The latter ones possess a high theoretical capacitance, whereas their
electrical conductivity and mechanical properties are poor. The intrinsic
shortcomings of these electroactive materials are disadvantageous
to develop high-performance, flexible, all-solid-state SCs. To overcome
these limitations, exploring novel electroactive materials or material
combinations is urgently needed, and it still remains a challenge
in current materials science.

With the structure similar to
that of graphene, two-dimensional
(2D) layered metal chalcogenide (LMC) nanostructures such as few-layered
VS2 nanosheets (NSs),27 metallic
MoS2 NSs or films,28−30 WS2 NSs,31 Cu2WS4 NSs,32 SnSe NSs, and SnSe2 nanodisks (NDs)33 have been found to be novel electroactive materials
for flexible SCs because of their high surface area, good electrical
conductivity, and excellent mechanical properties. As a member of
the LMC family, CuSe has been identified as a p-type multifunctional
semiconductor and is widely used in solar cells,34,35 gas sensors,36 photodetectors,37 and photocatalytic fields.38 However, its strong interlayer chemical bonding makes it
hard to obtain 2D CuSe NSs or NDs via a conventional “top-down”
strategy, that is, mechanical or liquid-assisted exfoliation of bulk
crystals. On the contrary, the “bottom-up” route may
be an ideal choice. By far, some “bottom-up” strategies
such as hydrothermal,38 colloidal chemical
route,39,40 microwave-assisted wet chemical synthesis,41 metal ions-mediated morphology, and phase transformation
method42 have been developed to synthesize
CuSe NSs or NDs. Despite great progress that has been achieved, fabrication
of 2D CuSe NSs or NDs with a desirable spacial orientation and open
channels remains a challenge, and their use in the field of SCs has
not been explored.

In this paper, a novel 2D CuSe NS film has
been successfully fabricated
on an Au-coated polyethylene terephthalate (PET) substrate through
a facile electrodeposition method and used as an electroactive material
for flexible all-solid-state SCs. The detailed synthetic procedure
is provided in the experimental section. Such CuSe NS films possess
the following significant features: (1) All CuSe NSs are almost perpendicular
to the Au-coated PET substrate and interwoven to form a free-standing
film with macropores or large open channels. Such configurations not
only can inhibit the restacking of CuSe NSs and fully utilize their
surface but also can offer many open channels for the diffusion of
electrolyte ions to the electrode surface. (2) The intrinsic good
electrical conductivity40 of the CuSe NS
building blocks renders such NS films directly usable as the carbon
black- and binder-free electrode to fabricate flexible SCs. (3) Such CuSe NS films have a good contact with the Au-coated PET
substrates, which can efficiently reduce contact resistance and improve
electron transfer efficiency. In a three-electrode system using 1
M Na2SO4 aqueous solution as the electrolyte,
the specific capacitance of such CuSe NS films can reach 209 F g–1 at a current density of 0.2 A g–1, which is comparable to or higher than those of other reported materials
(e.g., graphene (G)–Mn3O4 nanorods,43 N-doped ultrathin carbon NSs,44 etc.). Because of its high specific capacitance, such CuSe
NS films are further used to construct flexible all-solid-state SCs
(CuSe NS-SSCs). The fabricated CuSe NS-SSC device exhibits high volumetric
specific capacitance (30.17 mF cm–3), good cycling
stability, excellent flexibility, and desirable mechanical stability,
indicating that the CuSe NS film is an enticing candidate material
for use in high-performance, flexible, all-solid-state SCs. Moreover,
as a prototype for practical applications, three such solid devices
in series can be used to light up a red light-emitting diode (LED).

Results
and Discussion
To obtain high-quality CuSe NS films, electrodeposition
parameters
(deposition potential, temperature, and time) are first optimized.
The details are given in the Supporting Information. Though the CuSe NS films can be obtained at a wide range of deposition
potentials, their qualities are quite different. For example, when
the deposition potential deviates from −0.15 V [vs saturated
calomel electrode (SCE)] (Figure S1), the
edge length of the CuSe NS building blocks is not uniform and their
thickness becomes larger. In addition, when the deposition temperature
is lower than 60 °C, the crystallinity of the sample will be
reduced accompanied by the generation of some Se nanoparticles on
the surface of the sample (Figure S2).
Beyond deposition potential and temperature, the deposition time is
found to greatly affect the loading amount and the thickness of the
obtained NS film (Figure S3). The above
experiments imply that the optimal conditions are a deposition potential
of −0.15 V (vs SCE) at 60 °C for 30 min.

The microstructures
of the CuSe NS films obtained under optimal
deposition conditions are characterized using scanning electron microscopy
(SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). From the top-view
low-magnification SEM image (Figure 1a), a large-area uniform film can be clearly observed.
The related high-magnification SEM image (Figure 1b,c) reveals that such films are composed
of well-arranged NSs with edge lengths of approximately 1 μm.
Moreover, these NS building blocks are almost perpendicular to the
substrate and interwoven to form a free-standing film with large open
channels. As measured from Figure 1c, the average thickness of these CuSe NS building
blocks is approximately 15 nm. The related side-view SEM image (Figure 1d) analysis confirms
that the whole film is perpendicular to the substrate, and its height
is estimated to be approximately 4 μm. Further microstructure
analysis of such CuSe NSs is performed using TEM. The typical TEM
image (Figure 1e) reveals
that the primary building blocks of such NSs are irregular sheetlike
nanostructures. The dark contrast results from the overlap or interpenetration
of the NS building blocks, confirming the interpenetrating structure
of the NS film. The related high-resolution transmission electron
microscopy (HR-TEM) image (Figure 1f) of an individual NS building block exhibits clear
lattice fringes with a spacing of 3.46 and 3.46 Å, corresponding
to the interplanar separation of (100) and (010) planes of klockmannite
CuSe (JCPDS card: 34-0171), respectively. The intersection angle of
these two planes is measured to be 120°, which is identical to
the theoretical value between the (100) and (010) planes. These results
indicate that the top and bottom surfaces of the CuSe NS building
blocks are {001} surfaces. The corresponding selected area electron
diffraction (SAED) pattern shows clear diffraction spots, revealing
that the NS building blocks have a single-crystalline structure. Further
X-ray energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) was also performed to confirm
the component of the NS building blocks. The related EDS pattern is
shown in Figure S4a. The peaks at 11.21,
12.50, 1.38, and 1.42 keV correspond to the Kα, Kβ, Lα, and Lβ emissions
of selenium, respectively. The other peaks located at 8.04, 8.907,
and 0.92 keV are assigned to the Kα, Kβ, and Lβ emissions of copper, respectively. Using
integration calculation, the atomic ratio of Cu and Se is close to
1:1, implying that the NS may be CuSe. To evaluate the loading amount
of the CuSe NS active materials, the cathodic charge versus deposition
potential plots are provided in Figure S4b. On the basis of Faraday’s second law, the deposited mass
of the CuSe NS film is calculated (eq S1) to be approximately 0.65 mg cm–2.

of the CuSe NS film. (f) Corresponding HR-TEM image and SAED pattern

The constituents, phase structure, and crystallinity
of the obtained
CuSe NS film are examined using X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy,
and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Figure 2a shows the corresponding XRD pattern. Excluding
the diffraction peaks, labeled with asterisks, at 25.94 and 38.24°
that originate from the Au-coated PET substrate, two main diffraction
peaks located at 28.06 and 46.05° can be observed, which are
indexed to the (102) and (110) planes of CuSe with a hexagonal klockmannite
phase structure (JCPDS no. 34-0171). No diffraction peaks of other
impurities are found in the XRD pattern, indicating that the product
is pure CuSe. Raman spectrum is also performed to identify the constituents
of the product, as shown in Figure 2b. The most intense peak centered at 256.7 cm–1 is attributed to the stretching mode of the Cu–Se bond of
klockmannite CuSe, and the other peak located at 237.5 cm–1 corresponds to the Se–Se vibration model.45 In addition, the broad shoulder in the 135–203 cm–1 region may imply the existence of a metastable multiphase
in relation to the polycrystalline Cu–Se compound on its surface.45 Moreover, to identify the valence states of
Cu and Se elements, XPS analysis is further carried out. From the
XPS spectrum of Cu 2p (Figure 2c), the binding energy (BE) of the Cu 2p3/2 peak
is observed at 932.4 eV, which can be attributed to Cu2+ ions. At the BE of 934.7 eV, a weak characteristic satellite peak
for Cu2+ ions can also be seen, confirming that the valence
state of Cu is +2.46,47Figure 2d shows the XPS spectrum of Se 3d. The peak
at the BE of 55.1 eV is assigned to the characteristic Se 3d5/2 of Se2– ions, proving that the valence state of
the Se element is −2. These results demonstrate that the deposited
product is pure CuSe.46,47

for the Cu 2p and Se 3d regions of the obtained NS film.

The electrochemical properties of the CuSe NS film
obtained under
optimal deposition conditions are first evaluated in a three-electrode
system using 1 M Na2SO4 aqueous solution as
the electrolyte. Figure 3a shows the cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves of the CuSe NS film at
different scanning rates and that of the Au-coated PET substrate at
a scan rate of 100 mV s–1. The much larger CV pattern
observed on the former integrated electrode reveals that its capacitance
is much higher than that of the latter, and the contribution of the
substrate to the total capacitance of the integrated CuSe NS film
electrode can be neglected. It can be seen that the shapes of the
CV curves for such CuSe NS films are nearly unchanged as the scan
rates increase from 10 to 200 mV s–1, implying the
improved mass transportation, excellent electronic conductivity within
the nanostructures, and the small equivalent series resistance.23 Galvanostatic charge–discharge measurements
were performed to explore the potential applications of such CuSe
NS films as electroactive materials (Figure 3b). From the discharge curves, the specific
capacitances of the CuSe NS film at various current densities can
be calculated (eqs S2 and S3). As illustrated
in Figure 3c, the maximum
specific capacitance of such CuSe NS films is 209 F g–1 at the current density of 0.2 A g–1, which is
higher than or comparable to those of recently reported MnO2 nanocomposites,22 SnSe2 nanodisks,33 graphene(G)–Mn3O4 nanorods,43 N-doped ultrathin carbon
NSs,44 rGO–CoS2 nanohybrids,48 hierarchical MnMoO4/CoMoO4 heterostructured nanowires,49 and cobalt
phosphate ultralong nanoribbon-based microarchitectures.50

curves at different current densities. (c) Plot of the specific capacitance
vs current density. (d) Cycling performance of the CuSe NS film electrode.

The long-term cycling stability
of the CuSe NS film electrode is
evaluated using the galvanostatic charge–discharge test at
a current density of 1.0 A g–1. As shown in Figure 3d, the CuSe NS electrode
can retain ∼90% of its initial capacitance after continuously
working for 10 000 cycles, indicating the good electrochemical
cycling stability or durability of the electrode. The first five and
the last five charge–discharge cycles are shown in Figure S5a,b. To get some insight into the good
cycling stability of the CuSe NS film electrode, its microstructure
after the cycling test is examined using SEM, as shown in Figure S5c. The result reveals that there is
only a slight variation in the microstructure of the CuSe NS film
after the cycling test, which may be the origin of its good cycling
stability.

For safety and portable consideration, all-solid-state
SCs are
superior to their counterparts with liquid electrolytes, which need
robust encapsulation to prevent leakage of the liquid electrolyte.
Stacked symmetric all-solid-state SCs are further fabricated using
the CuSe NS film obtained under optimal deposition conditions as the
active material and are abbreviated as CuSe NS-SSCs. The polymer gel [polyvinyl alcohol (PVA)–LiCl] serves as
both the separator and the solid-state electrolyte. Figure 4a shows the detailed configuration
of the solid device. For the actual solid device, the working area
is 3 cm–2 and the thickness is 0.035 cm. The volume
of the whole device is calculated to be ∼0.105 cm3. The CV profiles (Figure 4b) of the CuSe NS-SSC device show obvious redox peaks at a
scan rate ranging from 10 to 200 mV s–1, indicating
the pseudocapacitance behavior that is attributed to the surface adsorption
of Li+ ions and the fast reversible surface redox reactions.
Moreover, the galvanostatic charge–discharge tests of the solid
device are performed at various current densities, and the related
discharging branch curves are shown in Figure 4c. The observed linear voltage–time
profiles without an obvious IR drop demonstrate a low internal resistance
and an excellent capacitive performance of the solid device. The volumetric
specific capacitances of the solid device, calculated from Figure 4c (eq S4), are 30.17, 16.64, 13.83, 10.07, 7.41, 7.09, and 6.74
mF cm–3 at the volume current density of 0.14, 0.23,
0.29, 0.43, 0.57, 0.86, and 1.14 mA cm–3, respectively
(Figure 4d). The excellent
energy storage performance of our solid device may be attributed to
the vertically oriented and interwoven configuration of the active
CuSe NS materials that form macropores or open channels, facilitating
the adsorption or diffusion of electrolyte ions for the Faradaic redox
reaction. Even so, the specific capacitance of the CuSe NS film-based
all-solid-state device is much lower than that tested in Na2SO4 aqueous solution. This phenomenon is very common in
other electroactive materials, which is mainly attributed to the distinct
diffusion ability of the electrolyte ions in those two systems. As
for the solid device, the PVA–LiCl gel electrolyte is dispersed
on the surface of the CuSe NS film and solidifies gradually owing
to the evaporation of the excess water. The diffusion ability of the Li+ ion in the solid medium
is much lower than that in the aqueous solution, which could reduce
the redox reaction level on the surface of the CuSe NS film. Thus,
relative to that in liquid electrolyte, its specific capacitance is
greatly reduced. Additionally, the CuSe NS active materials contact
well with the current collector, which can reduce the contact resistance
and offer another positive contribution to fast electron transport
in the solid device. The cycling stability of the CuSe NS-SSC device
is further evaluated using the galvanostatic charge–discharge
test at a constant current density. After
continuously operating for 10 000 cycles, the charge–discharge
curves of the solid device are still highly symmetrical (Figure S6), indicating good electrochemical stability
and capacitance retention ability. Figure 4e shows the plot of the volume-specific capacitance
versus the cycling number. At the volume current density of 0.57 mA
cm–3, 90% of the initial capacitance value can be
reserved after 10 000 cycles, revealing the excellent cycling
stability of the solid device. Moreover, to explore the possibility
for practical applications, three such solid devices are connected
in series, with the dream to light up a red LED (1.65
V, 2 mA). As shown in Figure 4f, the red LED can be lighted for 3 min after being charged
at 40 μA cm–2 for 150 s.

Furthermore, the fabricated CuSe NS-SSC device also shows
excellent
flexibility and hence can be bent at different angles (Figure S7) without loss of the electrochemical
performance. Figure 5 shows the CV response signal of the CuSe NS-SSC device that was
bent from 0 to 180°. Compared with the CV signal recorded at
a scan rate of 200 mV s–1 without bending (0°),
the CV curve is only slightly changed when bent to 90°. At a
greater bending curvature of 180°, there is nearly no change,
and the CV plot is almost identical. In addition, even after being
folded thousands of times at different bending angles, the CV response
signal of the solid device is nearly unchanged, indicating that the
device possesses the desirable mechanical stability.

Conclusions
In summary, a novel
2D CuSe NS film has been successfully integrated
on an Au-coated PET substrate for the first time through a facile
electrodeposition method after optimizing the deposition parameters.
In such NS films, the CuSe NS building blocks are of hexagonal klockmannite
phase and vertically oriented on the substrate to form a free-standing
film with many macropores or open channels. By directly using such
CuSe NS films as the electrode, its mass specific capacitance can
reach 209 F g–1 at a current density of 0.2 A g–1, which is comparable to or higher than those of other
reported materials (e.g., G–Mn3O4 nanorods,
N-doped ultrathin carbon NSs, etc.). Such CuSe NS films are further
used as electrodes to fabricate symmetric, flexible, all-solid-state
SCs using PVA–LiCl gel as both the solid electrolyte and the
separator. The fabricated solid device exhibits high volumetric specific
capacitance (30.17 mF cm–3), good cycling stability,
excellent flexibility, and desirable mechanical stability. Additionally,
as a prototype for practical applications, a tandem of three such
solid devices can light up a red LED for approximately 3 min. This
work not only provides an efficient avenue to resolve the spacial
orientation problem of CuSe NS building blocks but also confirms that
a vertically oriented and interpenetrating CuSe NS film is an ideal
candidate electrode for high-performance, flexible, all-solid-state
SCs. Further integrating other electroactive materials (e.g., Ni(OH)2, MnO2, etc.) with the CuSe NS films to fabricate
advanced hybrid electrodes is under way in our laboratory.

Experimental
Section
Reagents and Materials
CuCl2·2H2O (99%), SeO2 (99%), KCl (99%), LiCl (97%), and
HCl (37%) were purchased from Alfa Aesar and directly used without
further purification. PET pieces and PVA were purchased from Zhuhai
Kaivo Optoelectronic Technology Co. and Chengdu Kelong Chemical Reagent
Co., respectively.

Synthesis of CuSe NS Films
CuSe
NS films were directly
grown on the Au-coated PET substrate via a facile electrodeposition
method. The thickness of the Au film coated on the PET pieces was
approximately 80 nm. Before electrodeposition, the electrolyte was
prepared by dissolving CuCl2·2H2O (2 mM),
SeO2 (4.5 mM), and KCl (0.1 M) in 1000 mL of distilled
water. The pH of the solution was adjusted to 1.5 using a 0.2 M HCl
solution. The electrodeposition experiments were carried out in a
standard three-electrode cell using an Au-coated PET piece, a Pt sheet,
and an SCE as the working electrode, counter electrode, and reference
electrode, respectively. The CuSe NS film was prepared under a potentiostatic
mode. To obtain high-quality NS films, a series of experiments were
performed to optimize the deposition parameters. The deposited potentials
were varied from −0.02 to −0.20 V (vs SCE), and the
deposition temperatures were tuned from 20 to 80 °C. When the
deposition temperature was 60 °C, a high-quality CuSe NS film
can be obtained by electrodeposition at −0.15 V (vs SCE) for
30 min.

Materials Characterization
SEM images of the CuSe NS
films were taken on a scanning electron microscope (FEI quanta 200
and Helios 600i), operating at an accelerating voltage of 20 kV. TEM
and HR-TEM images were taken on an FEI, Tecnai F20 transition electron
microscope at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. XRD patterns were
recorded using a Dandong Comp. TD-3500 diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.54056 Å). XPS data were
acquired using a scanning X-ray microprobe (PHI 5000 Verasa). BEs
of Cu 2p and Se 3d were calibrated using the C 1s peak (BE = 284.6
eV) as a standard.

Electrochemical Tests of CuSe NS Films
The electrochemical
performance was examined in a three-electrode system, and the electrolyte
used in the electrochemical measurement was 1 M Na2SO4 aqueous solution. The as-prepared CuSe NS film on the Au-coated
PET substrate, a platinum plate, and an SCE were used as the working
electrode, counter electrode, and reference electrode, respectively.
All electrochemical tests were performed on an electrochemical workstation
(CHI 660D) at room temperature.

Fabrication and Electrochemical
Tests of Flexible All-Solid-State
SCs
For the fabrication of flexible all-solid-state SCs,
two pieces of CuSe NS film on Au-coated PET electrodes were immersed
in the PVA–LiCl gel solution for 5 min to adsorb a layer of
the solid electrolyte. After the excess water was vaporized, the two pieces of electrodes coated with the
electrolyte were pressed together and placed inside of a vacuum oven
at 50 °C for 24 h. Thus, the stacked CuSe NS-SSC solid devices
were fabricated, which were used to evaluate the supercapacitive performance
on an electrochemical workstation (CHI 660D). The PVA–LiCl
gel electrolyte was prepared as follows: 6 g of LiCl was added into
60 mL of deionized water, and then, 6 g of PVA powder was added. The
whole mixture was heated to 85 °C under stirring until the solution
became clear.
