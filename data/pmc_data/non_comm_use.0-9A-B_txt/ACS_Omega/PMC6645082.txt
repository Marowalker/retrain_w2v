The impact of lithium-ion implantation
and postannealing processes
on improving the electrical conductivity and field electron emission
(FEE) characteristics of nitrogen-doped nanocrystalline diamond (nNCD)
films was observed to be distinctly different from those of undoped
NCD (uNCD) films. A high-dose Li-ion implantation induced the formation
of electron trap centers inside the diamond grains and amorphous carbon
(a-C) phases in grain boundaries for both types of NCD films. Postannealing
at 1000 °C healed the defects, eliminated the electron trap centers,
and converted the a-C into nanographitic phases. The abundant nanographitic
phases in the grain boundaries of the nNCD films as compared to the
uNCD films made an interconnected path for effectual electron transport
and consequently enhanced the FEE characteristics of nNCD films.

Introduction
Because of their negative electron affinity
and low effective work
function, nanocrystalline diamond (NCD) films are systematically investigated
for their application as field electron emitters.1 Though the physical properties of these films rely on the
intrinsic structure of the materials, their electrical and optical
properties are intimately associated to the microstructure of the
films.2−4 Therefore, the skill to regulate the microstructure
and surface morphology of an NCD film could modify this material for
a variety of applications such as hard coatings, optical windows,
micro-electro-mechanical systems, and electron emitters. An increase
of nondiamond carbon phases such as amorphous carbon (a-C) or trans-polyacetylene (t-PA) is observed
when decreasing the diamond grain size.5 These nondiamond carbon phases (a-C and t-PA) act
as conducting channels, facilitating easy tunneling of electrons and
hence enhance the field electron emission (FEE) properties of NCD
films through a “grain boundary conduction emission”
mechanism.6 However, the a-C and t-PA phases in the grain boundaries possess a low conductive
capacity that limits the FEE properties achievable for NCD films.7,8 Therefore, for the advancement of NCD-based field emitters, there
is a need to control the microstructure; especially, the modification
of nondiamond carbon phases is required to improve the electrical
conductivity of the materials.

Ion implantation is a possible
way to alter the electrical properties
of materials through doping with a wide variety of dopant species.9−11 By proper selection of the implantation energy and dose, the sp2/sp3 ratio of diamond and the related carbon materials
can be tailored.10,11 The sp2-bonded carbon
induced during the ion implantation and postannealing treatments of
NCD films is the “conductivity promoter”, which enables
the electrons to move freely inside the films. Lately, numerous reports
affirmed that N, O, P, Cu, Au, and Pt ions implanted into diamond
can considerably increase the electrical conductivity and FEE properties
of diamond materials.12−16 However, these ions are too large to substitutionally replace C
atoms and act as electron donors. Lithium is also an interesting element
to be implanted into diamond, as lithium is predicted to be able to
occupy the interstitial sites of diamond as a potential shallow donor.17 Early experiments on Li-ion implantation in
diamond films have demonstrated that there is a strong interaction
between Li ions and diamond, which leads to the introduction of radiation
defects during ion implantation.18 The
diamond films can also exhibit a high electron mobility depending
on the energy and dose of Li ions.19 An
enhancement of electrical conductivity and FEE properties for nitrogen-doped
NCD films is observed because of Li-ion implantation/annealing processes.20 Nevertheless, how implanted Li-ions in NCD films
effect the microstructure and the electrical properties of these films
is not understood yet.

In this paper, a systematic investigation
of the effect of Li-ion
implantation and annealing processes on the electrical conductivity
and FEE behavior of NCD films is reported. We specifically designed
NCD films with two different microstructures, that is, undoped NCD
(uNCD) and nitrogen-doped NCD (nNCD) films, to investigate how the
modification in microstructure impacts the electrical conductivity
and FEE properties of the NCD films. A detailed work has been accomplished
to disclose the structural and chemical states of these films before
implantation, as implanted, and after implantation/annealing processes
by using micro-Raman spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The connection
of the microstructure of these films with the improvement of electrical
conductivity and FEE characteristics is discussed, emphasizing the
role of the microstructure of the starting materials and thereby clarifying
the mechanism of Li-ion implantation/annealing processes.

Results
Inset I in Figure 1a shows a scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of nonimplanted
uNCD (uNCDLi0), revealing the uniform coverage of the films
on Si substrates with a very rough surface. The films contain faceted
diamond grains of sizes of around 0.3–0.8 μm with clearly
distinguishable grain boundaries. Figure 1a displays a typical bright-field TEM (BF-TEM)
micrograph of a uNCDLi0 film. The discrete spot patterns
in the selective area electron diffraction (SAED, inset II in Figure 1a) are arranged nearly
along a ring, implying that the diamond grains are large and randomly
oriented. Moreover, the grain boundaries in these films are very sharp
with insignificant thickness that is related to the distinctive granular
structure of a microcrystalline diamond film.21 In contrast, inset I in Figure 1b shows an SEM image of a nonimplanted nNCD (nNCDLi0) film, indicating nanosized grains of roundish geometry
with a very smooth surface. Figure 1b shows a typical BF-TEM micrograph for the nNCDLi0 films, whereas inset II in this figure shows the corresponding
SAED pattern. There are weak contours delineating the grain boundaries
in the BF-TEM micrograph, revealing that these materials comprise
diamond grains of a size of about 50–80 nm. Darker contrast
regions of the diamond grains are oriented nearly along a zone-axis
and diffract electrons intensely, whereas the light contrast regions
adjacent to the dark contrast grains are diamond grains that are oriented
away from the zone-axis and diffract electrons faintly. The SAED encloses
sharp and continuous diffraction rings agreeing with the (111), (220),
and (311) lattice planes of the diamond, indicating that the nNCDLi0 films are predominantly diamond. A diffuse ring seems to
be in the center of the SAED pattern, indicating the presence of sp2-bonded carbon (nanographitic or a-C phase), along the grain
boundaries of the nNCDLi0 films.5

I and the associated SAEDs shown as inset II of (a) uNCD and (b) nNCD
films. (c) Micro-Raman spectra of (I) uNCD and (II) nNCD films.

Micro-Raman spectra, displayed
in Figure 1c, show
that the uNCDLi0 films
(spectrum I) comprise a sharp diamond resonance peak at 1334 cm–1 (indicated as “dia”), which is the
typical F2g band for the diamond lattice. Also present
are small broad resonance peaks close to 1138 cm–1 (ν1-band) and 1480 cm–1 (ν3-band), corresponding to the distortion modes of CHx bonds or the t-PA phase along the grain boundaries
of the uNCDLi0 films, and a band at 1540 cm–1 (G-band) representing the nanographite phase.22 In contrast, the diamond peak at ∼1334 cm–1 is only barely visible in the Raman spectrum of the nNCDLi0 films (spectrum II). These films are dominated by the ν1-band and ν3-band resonance peaks, the D-band
(1365 cm–1) and G-band (1560 cm–1) resonance peaks, which correspond to sp2-bonded carbon,
that is, disordered carbon and graphite.23−26 It should be mentioned that the
faintness of the diamond peak in spectrum II does not represent that
the nNCDLi0 films contain no sp3-bonded carbon.
It is attributed to the point that the Raman signal is more responsive
to the sp2-bonded carbon than to the sp3-bonded
carbon when excited with 488 nm.25

The NCD films were then subjected to lithium-ion implantation with
an implantation energy of 50 keV. The uNCD films, implanted with Li
ions using ion doses of 1012 to 1014 ions/cm2, are designated as uNCDLi12, uNCDLi13, and uNCDLi14, respectively. The Li-ion-implanted uNCD
films were further annealed at 1000 °C and are designated as
uNCDLi12A, uNCDLi13A, and uNCDLi14A. Similarly, the nNCD films are designated as nNCDLi12, nNCDLi13, and nNCDLi14, respectively, when
implanted with Li ions using ion doses of 1012 to 1014 ions/cm2 and are designated as nNCDLi12A, nNCDLi13A, and nNCDLi14A postannealing.

The electrical conductivity of both these pristine and Li-ion-implanted
NCD films was evaluated using the van der Pauw configuration. Curve
I in Figure 2a displays
that whereas the uNCDLi0 films are highly resistive to
be assessable using this technique, the electrical conductivity of
Li-ion-implanted uNCD films upsurges monotonously with increasing
ion dosage, from 1.1 × 10–7 S/cm for uNCDLi12 films to about 2.0 × 10–6 S/cm
for uNCDLi14 films (curve I, Figure 2a). On annealing, the electrical conductivity
value increases abruptly for all Li-ion-implanted uNCD films, reaching
a large value of about 0.08, 0.31, and 0.95 S/cm for uNCDLi12A, uNCDLi13A, and uNCDLi14A films, respectively
(curve II, Figure 2a). The nNCD films follow a similar trend as the uNCD films (curves
I and II, Figure 2b).
The electrical conductivity is low for nNCD Li0 films and
increases monotonically with the dose of Li-ion implantation. The
electrical conductivity value also increased abruptly after annealing,
to a large value of 1.64, 1.94, and 3.44 S/cm for nNCDLi12A, nNCD Li13A, and nNCD Li14A films, respectively.
The variations of the conductivity of the uNCD and nNCD films owing
to Li-ion implantation and annealing processes are tabulated in Table 1.

conductivity (curves I and II) and

Figure 3 depicts
the FEE properties of the uNCD and nNCD films implanted with different
doses of Li ions, before and after the annealing process. The FEE
parameters were extracted from the obtained current density (J)–applied field (E) curves by using
the Fowler–Nordheim (F–N) model,27 the F–N plot, ln(J/E2) versus 1/E, which are shown as insets
in Figure 3a. The turn-on
field (E0) nominated here is the lowest
value of the F–N plot, representing the intersection of the
line segments extrapolated from the low and high electrical field
regimes. The variation in E0 values with
different ion implantation doses, before and after annealing, is derived
from Figure 3a–d,
and is plotted as curves III and IV in Figure 2a,b. For both uNCD and nNCD films, the turn-on
field (E0-value) decreased with an increasing
dose of Li-ions (curve III, Figure 2a,b). The annealing process improved markedly the FEE
properties, that is, decreased the E0-value
(curve IV, Figure 2a,b). For Li-ion-implanted and annealed uNCD films, the E0 value decreased monotonously from (E0)uNCDLi12A = 30.3 V/μm to (E0)uNCDLi14A = 19.9 V/μm (curve IV, Figure 2a), whereas for the
Li-ion-implanted and annealed nNCD films, the E0 value decreased monotonically from (E0)nNCDLi12A = 19.6 V/μm to (E0)nNCDLi14A = 13.1 V/μm (curve IV, Figure 2b). The FEE properties
of the materials are also tabulated in Table 1, showing that they are closely correlated
with their electrical conductivity. The nNCD series shows markedly
higher electrical conductivity and thus enhanced FEE properties than
the uNCD series. The nNCDLi14A films show the best electrical
conductivity (3.44 S/cm) and FEE behavior (E0 = 13.1 V/μm) among all the NCD films.

are before and (b,d) are after annealing. The insets show the corresponding
F–N plots corresponding to the J–E curves.

To comprehend how the
Li-ion implantation and annealing processes
enhance the electrical conductivity and the FEE properties of NCD
films, we have accomplished thorough investigations using micro-Raman
spectroscopy, XPS, and TEM. Curves I to III in Figure 4a,c display that the Li-ion implantation
process insignificantly modifies the Raman spectra of the uNCD and
nNCD films, respectively. Curves I to III in Figure 4b,d show that subsequent annealing also does
not profoundly alter these characteristics. However, detailed analyses
reveal some subtle changes because of the Li-ion implantation/annealing
processes. It should be mentioned that, in the estimation of the It-PA/(ID + IG) and the ID/IG ratio, the integrated
intensities of ν1, ν3, D-band, and
G-band peaks, that is, Iν1, Iν3, ID, and IG, were used. These values were taken after
normalization of the resonance peaks. Figure 5a shows that, for Li-ion-implanted uNCD films,
the It-PA/(ID + IG) ratio increases
(curve I) and the ID/IG ratio decreases (curve III) with ion dose. This specifies
that ion implantation induces the formation of t-PA
and nanographitic phases, which are mainly located in the grain boundaries
of uNCD films. Upon annealing, the It-PA/(ID + IG) and the ID/IG ratios show an opposite trend with the ion
dose, that is, the It-PA/(ID + IG) ratio decreases (curve II) and the ID/IG ratio increases (curve IV) with ion
dose, which indicates the dissociation of CH bonds in the t-PA phase placed at the grain boundaries of the uNCD films,
converting them into a highly stable nanographitic phase because of
the annealing process.28 In contrast, Figure 5b shows that the It-PA/(ID + IG) ratio of nNCD films
decreases with ion dose both before (curve I) and after (curve II)
annealing. This shows that the net amount of t-PA
decreases, comparative to the aggregate of other sp2-bonded
carbon phases in the films, with an increase in ion dose both before
and after annealing. The degree of disorder or graphitization of clustered
sp2-bonded carbon phases in the films is evaluated from
the ID/IG ratio.29,30 Before and after annealing, the ID/IG ratio increases with increasing ion dose (curve
III and curve IV) for the nNCD films, indicating the increase in the
formation of nanographite from a-C relative to the sp3 content.
The transformation of the phases occurred as said by a three-stage
model of increasing disorder in carbon materials.25,26 Restated, there is a conversion of the grain boundary t-PA phase into the nanographitic phase or from diamond (sp3-bonded carbon) to sp2 content owing to Li-ion implantation
and annealing processes.

of the (ν1 + ν3), D-band, and G-band
peaks.

It is known that the modification
of surface properties can also
have a very important impact on the conductivity and FEE properties
of the materials.31,32 To recognize how the Li-ion implantation/postannealing
processes possibly modify the surface characteristics of NCD films,
XPS studies were accomplished. Carbon 1s (C 1s) core level peaks obtained
from XPS spectra for nonannealed and annealed Li-ion-implanted uNCD
and nNCD films are shown in Figure 6a,b, correspondingly. The C 1s peak of uNCDLi0 (spectrum I, Figure 6a) is observed at 284.1 eV, which is ascribed to bulk diamond.33 The ion implantation process results in a blue
shift for C 1s (spectra II, III, and IV of Figure 6a). The blue shift for the C 1s peak is caused
by the presence of surface charges linked to the presence of electron-trapping
centers in these films.34,35 The extent of the blue
shift does not seem to change appreciably with the dose of ion implantation.
In as-grown films, the H– ions are absorbed in point
defects (vacancies) present in the NCD films, compensating for dangling
bonds, and no surface charging phenomenon was observed.36 Li-ion implantation causes the exclusion of
H– and exposes the dangling bonds, which can then
perform as trapping centers for electrons, inducing the observed C
1s blue shift.37 The increase in the Li-ion
dose does not further change this behavior. After annealing, the C
1s peak inversely shifts toward the normal C 1s peak (284.3 eV) for
the uNCDLi14A films (spectrum V, Figure 6a), which can be accounted for by the healing
of defects. The electrical conductivity of the uNCDLi14A films was thus enhanced.36 The data not
shown here reveal that a similar phenomenon, that is, the reverse
shift of the blue-shifted C 1s peak to normal C 1s position because
of the annealing process, is also observed for the uNCDLi12A and uNCDLi13A films, which is also accounted for by the
healing of the point defects in these materials.

films before and after annealing where the dose of Li ions implanted

for (I) uNCDLi14A and (II) nNCDLi14A films.

Similarly, Li-ion implantation
also induced a marked blue shift
of the C 1s peak for the nNCD series of samples (spectra II to IV, Figure 6b), and the blue-shifted
C 1s peak was also reversely shifted back to the normal position because
of the annealing process (spectrum V, Figure 6b). The elimination of electron trap centers
because of the compensation of dangling bonds (or the healing of the
atomic defects) during annealing is apparently an important factor,
which enhances the electrical conductivity and the FEE properties
of the materials. It should be mentioned that the C 1s peak of the
nNCDLi0 sample (spectrum I of Figure 6b) is observed at 285.6 eV, which is 0.6
eV higher compared to the normal C 1s peak (285.0 eV).38 The occurrence of this difference in nonimplanted
nNCDLi0 films is attributable to the presence of CN species
in the growing plasma (CH4/H2/N2).
CN species have a stronger tendency to bind to the existing diamond
clusters,39,40 forming dangling bonds, which cannot be
compensated for effectively by the H– species. However,
this aspect of the study needs a more detailed investigation to confirm
such an assumption.

The C 1s peaks for the uNCDLi14A and nNCDLi14A films were fitted using Lorentzian peaks
to evaluate the relative
intensities of sp3 and sp2 components in these
films. In the uNCDLi14A films, the sp3 fraction
is dominant with an intensity of 56.5%, the sp2 intensity
is 43.8% (spectrum I, Figure 6c), whereas the nNCDLi14A films shows an sp3 peak of 35.4% with an sp2 peak intensity of 64.6%
(spectrum II, Figure 6c). Interestingly, the sp2 content for the nNCDLi14A films is markedly higher than in the uNCDLi14A films,
which is in accordance with the Raman data (cf. Figures 4 and 5). Apparently,
a more abundant sp2 content upon Li-ion implantation and
annealing processes in the nNCDLi14A films compared to
those in the uNCDLi14A films is also an important factor,
resulting in the improvement of the electrical conductivity and FEE
properties of the nNCD films (cf. Figures 2 and 3 and Table 1).

Although
the variation of the bonding character of NCD films and
the surface characteristics of these films owing to Li-ion implantation
and annealing processes, which were deduced from micro-Raman spectroscopy
and XPS, respectively, is in accordance with the trend for the improvement
in the electrical conductivity and the FEE properties of the films,
the extent to which the bonding character changes is very small, which
makes it unlikely that it can fully account for the large improvement
in the electrical conductivity and the FEE properties of NCD. The
microstructure of the uNCDLi14A and nNCDLi14A films was investigated using TEM in order to clarify the key factor
for enhancing the electrical conductivity and FEE enhancement of the
nNCDLi14A films. Figure 7a displays the typical granular structure of the uNCDLi14A films, where only the grains oriented close to some zone-axis
strongly diffract electrons and illustrate a high contrast. The nearby
grains are oriented away from the zone-axis, presenting no contrast
(indicated by an arrow). The distinct spot patterns in the SAED pattern
(inset in Figure 7a)
designate that the diffraction spots are organized along a ring, representing
that the diamond grains were arbitrarily oriented. The high-resolution
TEM (HRTEM) micrograph revealed in Figure 7b, which contains the materials in the vicinity
of grain boundary, discloses the structure image of region “A”
in Figure 7a, demonstrating
that the diamond grains comprise a complex microstructure. The Fourier
transformed (FT) diffractogram of the whole structure image (FT0) specifies that the diamond film is basically a cubic diamond
structure (3C diamond) oriented in the [011] zone-axis. An FT image
of the nominated region “1” (ft1 image) indicates
that the films contain mostly the diamond phase; however, the ft2 image of the designated region “2” reveals
the presence of a-C phases. It should be noted that the diamond grains
corresponding to designated region “2” are oriented
away from the zone-axis and diffract electrons weakly such that the
minor phases situated beneath this grain show up, resulting in a diffuse
central ring in the ft2 image.

micrograph of uNCDLi14A films with
the corresponding SAED pattern as inset. (b) HRTEM micrograph, the
structure image, of uNCDLi14A films, corresponding to region
“A” in “a”. Inset FT0 shows
the Fourier-transformed image corresponding to the whole structure
image. The ft1 and ft2 images show the FT images
corresponding to regions “1” and “2” of
the structure image, respectively.

Conversely, Figure 8a displays the typical BF-TEM micrograph for the nNCDLi14A films, with the inset displaying a consistent SAED pattern.
The
SAED contains sharp continuous diffraction rings corresponding to
the (111), (220), and (311) lattice planes of the diamond, which indicates
the occurrence of randomly oriented small diamond grains. Some regions
are of dark contrast, corresponding to diamond grains oriented along
a zone-axis that diffracts electrons strongly; however, some regions
are of light contrast, corresponding to diamond grains oriented away
from the zone-axis that diffracts electrons weakly. A diffuse ring
appears in the center of the SAED pattern, signifying the presence
of sp2-bonded carbon (amorphous or crystalline). The HRTEM
microstructure image corresponding to region “B” in Figure 8a is revealed in Figure 8b. The FT diffractogram
representing the whole structure image is displayed as inset FT0 of Figure 8b, which entails the diffraction spots organized in ring geometry,
representing the occurrence of randomly oriented diamond grains. A
weak diffuse ring with donut-geometry is noticeable, suggesting that
the sp2-bonded carbon that exists in these films is nanographite.
There are some weak parallel fringes, which are the (111) lattice
planes of the diamond, observable all over the structure image in Figure 8b, confirming the
presence of diamond in these materials. The diamond and nanographite
phases are emphasized by the ft1 and ft2 images,
being regions “1” and “2” in Figure 8b, correspondingly.
Notably, the ft1 image contains strong diffraction spots,
which correspond to the (111) diamond lattice planes (parallel fringes)
in region “1”, and the central diffuse ring is not observable
due to the strong diffraction of electrons by the (111) diamond lattice
planes. Only when the diamond grains are oriented away from a zone-axis
and diffract electrons weakly can the presence of a central diffuse
ring be observed, as shown in the ft2 image corresponding
to region “2”. On the basis of the TEM investigations
for the nNCDLi14A films, it is concluded that the Li-ion
implantation and consecutive annealing process mainly persuade the
formation of abundant nanographitic phases. Such an observation is
in accordance with the results from Raman and XPS investigations.
A similar phase transformation phenomenon might also occur to the
uNCDLi14A films but the proportion of the nanographitic
phase formed in these films is too small to form an interconnected
conduction path. This is, in turn, due to the large grain granular
structure of the pristine uNCD films, which comprise very sharp grain
boundaries and small proportion of grain boundary phases. The nanographitic
phase forms an interconnected network, creating conduction paths for
transporting electrons, which is acknowledged as the key factor ensuing
greater electrical conductivity and FEE properties for the nNCDLi14A films as compared to those of the uNCDLi14A films.

image. The ft1 and ft2 images show the FT images
corresponding to regions “1” and “2” of
the structure image, respectively.

Discussion
It is stated that a combination of Li-ion implantation
and annealing
can efficiently increase the electrical conductivity and FEE properties
of diamond films. Theoretical studies have proposed that lithium ions
can perform as a shallow donor in diamond via occupying the interstitial
sites of the materials.41 Other theoretical
calculations visualize a low activation energy for Li diffusion in
the crystal lattice of diamond.17 However,
many researchers have tried to dope lithium in diamond via implantation,42 diffusion (including electro-diffusion),43,44 adsorption,45 and accumulation of Li
to the gas phase during diamond growth,46 but none was successful, most likely because Li atoms do not take
single interstitial positions but have the tendency to aggregate or
couple with other impurities and defects because of their high chemical
activity.47 Moreover, Smith et al.48 observed that implanted Li ions in polycrystalline
diamond films display noticeable diffusion into the grain boundaries
of the diamond films when the films were annealed at 1000 °C
and above. Accordingly, Li ions tend to reside in grain boundary regions
rather than being (interstitially) incorporated into the bulk of the
diamond. This implies that Li ions implanted into NCD films tend to
reside at the grain boundaries, which can activate the formation of
nanographitic phases20 and, thereby, enhance
the FEE properties for these films. Indeed, the abovementioned observations
revealed that owing to the existence of abundant grain boundaries
in NCD films, the Li-ion implantation/annealing process can efficiently
enhance the conductivity and FEE properties of NCD films but not in
microcrystalline and single-crystalline diamond films. Similarly,
the improvement in electrical conductivity and FEE properties because
of the Li-ion implantation/annealing process is better for nNCD films
than for uNCD films, which is ascribed to the initiation of more nanographitic
phases in nNCD films.

The question that still remains is why
the Li-ion implantation/annealing
process encourages more abundant sp2 nanographitic phases
in nNCD films than in uNCD films? In order to know this phenomenon,
the trajectory of the Li ions in diamond was evaluated using TRIM
software. To facilitate the comparison, the same analysis was performed
for a-C, which represents the grain boundary phase. The ion range
of the Li-implanted ions (50 keV), calculated by TRIM, is 160.3 nm
with straggling of 31.0 nm for diamond (Figure 9a) and is 252.4 nm with straggling of 45.5
nm for a-C materials (Figure 9b). These results indicate that it is much more difficult
for Li ions to interact with diamond than with a-C, which explains
the unsuccessful incorporation of Li into the bulk of diamond, as
observed by Popovici et al.49

Figure 9 TRIM software
calculation to evaluate the trajectory of Li ions
(e.g., ion range and straggling) in (a) diamond and (b) a-C materials.

Time-of-flight secondary ion mass
spectroscopy (TOF-SIMS) depth
profiles presented in Figure 10 confirm that Li ions are implanted to a depth of about 1700
nm for the uNCDLi14A and nNCDLi14A films. However,
the peak concentration is located at around 575 nm beneath the surface
for the nNCDLi14A films (Figure 10b), which is slightly higher than the peak
concentration of the uNCDLi14A films (∼560 nm; Figure 10a). As mentioned
earlier, the uNCD films comprise faceted diamond grains with sharp
grain boundaries, whereas the nNCD films possess wider grain boundaries,
which contain t-PA phases. The implanted Li ions
can capably interrelate with the t-PA phases in the
grain boundaries of nNCD films, dissociating the t-PA phase into disordered carbon (or a-C), which is in accordance
with the TRIM calculation (Figure 9). The implanted Li ions can also desorb H and induce
the formation of dangling bonds, which act as electron trap centers.
Annealing at 1000 °C effectively healed the atomic defects induced
in the diamond grains (electron trap centers were eliminated) and
converted the disordered carbon (or a-C) in the grain boundaries into
the nanographitic phase. The phase transformation of disordered carbon
(or a-C) into nanographitic phases was facilitated by the catalytic
effect of the Li ions existing in the grain boundaries.20 All these processes improved the electrical
conductivity and FEE characteristics of the nNCDLi14A films.6,12,13 Consequently, the implanted Li
ions are much more efficient in inducing the formation of nanographitic
phases in the grain boundaries of the nNCD films compared to the uNCD
films and enhance the electrical conductivity and FEE properties for
these films. The difference in electrical conductivity and FEE behavior
of Li-ion-implanted and annealed nNCD and uNCD films is caused by
the difference in granular structure as well as the bonding characteristics
of the two pristine nNCD and uNCD films.

Conclusions
The
characteristics of NCD films were methodically examined to
understand the roles of lithium-ion implantation and annealing in
enhancing the electrical and FEE properties of NCD films. Micro-Raman
and XPS studies indicated that Li-ion implantation encouraged electron
trap centers in both uNCD and nNCD films. Postannealing restored the
atomic defects and transformed the disordered carbon (or a-C phase)
into more stable nanographitic phases. The more abundant nanographitic
phases were present in the grain boundaries of the nNCDLi14A films that organized an interrelated path for electron transport
and improved more markedly the electrical conductivity and FEE properties
of the nNCDLi14A films associated with other kinds of NCD
films, especially the uNCD films. The superior electrical conductivity
and FEE characteristics of the nNCDLi14A films via Li-ion
implantation and postannealing processes open the prospect of using
such material for device applications.

Experimental Methods
The Si(100) substrates were seeded by a water-based state-of-the-art
colloidal suspension of 5 nm detonation nanodiamonds.50 For synthesizing the NCD films, the seeded Si substrates
were then placed in an ASTeX 6500 series microwave plasma-enhanced
chemical vapor deposition reactor. A gas mixture of CH4 (3 sccm) and H2 (297 sccm) (CH4/H2 = 1/99) was used for the growth of uNCD films and a gas mixture
of CH4 (18 sccm), H2 (267), and N2 (15 sccm) (CH4/H2/N2 = 6/89/5)
was used as the starting gas mixture for the growth of nNCD films.
The microwave power of 3000 W and the total pressure of 30 Torr were
maintained for the preparation of both pristine NCD films. The substrate
temperature was measured using an optical pyrometer and was estimated
to be around 675 °C during the growth of the uNCD films and around
540 °C during the growth of the nNCD films. Both NCD films were
grown to a thickness of 500 nm. Lithium ion implantations were then
executed on both these NCD films with an implantation energy of 50
keV (EATON, 200 kV) using ion doses of 1012 to 1014 ions/cm2 at room temperature. The ion-implanted NCD films
were further annealed at 1000 °C for 30 min under vacuum (3 ×
10–5 Torr; typical base pressure: 2 × 10–6 Torr).

SEM (FEI Quanta 200 FEG microscope),
TEM (JEOL 2100F), confocal
micro-Raman spectroscopy (a Horiba Jobin-Yvon T64000 spectrometer;
λ = 488 nm and spot size = ∼1 μm), and TOF-SIMS
(an ION-TOF 5 system (IONTOF GmbH) were performed; the analyzer was
operated in the positive polarity mode with a Bi3+ ion source (30
kV) for analysis and an O2+ ion source (2 kV)
for sputtering; depth profiling was performed in the spectrometry
mode(non-interlaced) with a reflector voltage of 200 V, a cycle time
of 200 μs, a sampling area of 100 × 100 μm2, and sputtering area of 300 × 300 μm2; charge
compensation was performed using a flood gun. The TOF-SIMS spectra
were mass-calibrated on the CxHy fragments and XPS (Thermo-VG Scientific ESCALab
250 Microprobe equipped with a monochromatic Al Kα X-ray source
(1486.6 eV); pressure = 10–9 Torr) was used to characterize
the diamond samples. Hall measurements in a van der Pauw configuration
(ECOPIA HMS-3000) were used to estimate the electrical conductivity
of these films. The FEE properties of the NCD films were measured
with a tunable parallel cathode–anode setup, in which the anode
was a molybdenum rod of 2 mm diameter and the sample-to-anode distance
was controlled using a micrometer. The current–voltage (I–V) characteristics were measured
using an electrometer (Keithley 2410) at a pressure below 10–6 Torr.12
