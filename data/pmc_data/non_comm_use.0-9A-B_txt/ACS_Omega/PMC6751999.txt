The mini-generator of electrical
energy exploiting Marangoni soluto-capillary
flows is reported. The interfacial flows are created by molecules
of camphor emitted by the “camphor engines” placed on
floating polymer rotors bearing permanent magnets. Camphor molecules
adsorbed by the water/vapor interface decrease its surface tension
and create the stresses resulting in the rotation of the system. The
alternative magnetic flux in turn creates the current in the stationary
coil. The long-lasting nature of rotation (approximately 10–20
h) should be emphasized. The brake-specific fuel consumption of the
reported generator is better than that reported for the best reported
electrical generators. Various engineering implementations of the
mini-generator are reported.

1 Introduction
Micro-
and mini-generators of electrical energy are receiving a
considerable amount of interest from both theoretical1 and application points of view.2−6 Electromagnetic2−5 and electrostatic6 microgenerators
should be distinguished. A diversity of power sources was involved
for micropower generation including exploitation of external vibrations,2 microscale combustion of hydrocarbon fuels,5 chemical energy,7 and
in particular the conversion of liquid-phase hydrogen to usable hydrogen
gas (H2).8 We report the centimeter-scaled
electromagnetic mini-generator converting the energy of soluto-capillary
flows into electromagnetic energy. More accurately speaking, we suggest
the mini-generator based on the self-propelled rotor based on the
Marangoni flows.9−15 Self-propulsion, driven by Marangoni flows, is a result of unbalanced
surface tension forces.9−15 The Marangoni flow is created as a result of gradients in chemical
concentration or temperature at the liquid/vapor interface.13−15 The profoundly developed theory of the effect has been addressed
recently in ref (15). Thermo- and soluto-capillary Marangoni flows were successfully
used for a number of technological applications such as microfluidic
devices,16 inkjet printing,17 miniature rolling bearings,18 spreading of emulsions,19,20 and microrobotics.21,22 The possibility of manufacturing electrical energy with self-propelled
droplets has been demonstrated recently in ref (23). We demonstrate the possibility
of manufacture of the electrical energy with the self-propelled rotator
driven with Marangoni solute-capillary flows.24,25

2 Results and Discussion
The experimental system
is shown in Figure 1. Deionized water, used as supporting liquid,
was purified by a synergy UV water purification system from Millipore
SAS (France), and its specific resistivity was ρ̂ = 18.2
MΩ · cm at 25 °C. The plastic dish (ø 420 mm)
was filled with deionized water, and the height of the supporting
liquid hl was 10 ± 0.5 mm. Camphor,
C10H16O (96%), was supplied by Sigma-Aldrich.
The experiments were recorded with a Logitech C310 camera. Movies
were processed using the VirtualDub-1.10.4 software and specially
developed software. All of the experiments were performed at ambient
conditions (SATP). Two-, four-, and six-pole polymer (PP (polypropylene))
rotors were used for the generation of ac, as depicted in Figure 2a–c. The PP
film thickness was 0.08 mm.

Figure 1 Scheme of the microelectric power generator
is depicted. i is the alternative current.

Figure 2 (a) Two-pole scheme of the rotor used for the generation
of ac
is presented. (b) Four-pole scheme of the rotor used for the generation
of ac is presented. (c) Six-pole scheme used for generation of ac
is shown.

Neodymium magnets (m = 1 g; diameter 6 mm) were
located on the rotor, as depicted in Figure 2a–c (B ≅ 0.5
T as measured at the surface of the magnet and B ≅
0.4 T as established in the vicinity of the coil). Magnetic fields
were measured by the 1-Axis dc/ac Model GM2 gaussmeter manufactured
by AlphaLab, Inc. (USA). The lab-made coil was used in the scheme.
The coil contained 800 loops of copper wire with a diameter of 0.1
mm. The coil’s outer diameter was 15.3 mm, and the internal
diameter was 6.5 mm. The coil’s resistance was r = 35 Ω, and the coil’s mass was m ≈
2 g. The resistance R = 35 Ω was connected
to the coil. The maximal voltage on the resistance was U = 1.6 mV. The voltage loss was measured with a SOUNTRON MS8213 multimeter.

The evaporation of camphor was studied as follows: the mass loss
was controlled for engines with diameters of 6.5 and 4 mm and with
areas of camphor evaporation S = (3.3 ± 0.1)
× 10–5 m2 and S = (1.3 ± 0.1) × 10–5 m2,
respectively. Camphor was evaporated under a temperature T of 25 °C and humidity RH of 0.45 for 5 h.
The average specific rate of the evaporation of camphor for both engines
was established as  and , respectively (as related to
the unit surface
of evaporation), as illustrated in Figure 3 (). Camphor mass
loss was measured with a
four-decimal place analytical balance ASB-220-C2.

Figure 3 Kinetics of evaporation
of camphor from the engines (see Table 1) is depicted; m is the mass of the
evaporated camphor.

Two kinds of “camphor
engines” with nozzle diameters
of 4 and 6.5 mm were used in the research. The camphor engines with
a nozzle diameter of 4 mm were used for the two-pole rotor (see Figure 2a); the camphor engines
with a nozzle diameter of 6.5 mm were used for the four- and six-pole
rotors (see Figure 2b,c). The parameters of the camphor engines are summarized in Table 1.

Rotors were driven by the Marangoni
interfacial soluto-capillary
flows, depicted schematically in Figure 4. Molecules of camphor evaporated from engines
were adsorbed partially by the water/vapor interface, as shown in Figure 4. The adsorbed molecules
of camphor decreased the surface tension of water,26−29 thus giving rise to the misbalance
of surface stresses, resulting in Marangoni flows, driving the rotors,
as depicted in Figure 4 and illustrated in Movies S1 and S2. The rotating magnets attached to rotors produced
alternating magnetic flux, resulting in AC produced in the coil. The
quantitative output parameters of generators exploiting the reported
rotors are summarized in Table 2.

Figure 4 Displacement of rotors by interfacial (Marangoni soluto-capillary)
flows is depicted.

The power-to-weight ratio P̂ of the reported
generators is worse than the corresponding parameters reported for
hydroelectric turbines, thermoelectric generators, electrochemical
(galvanic), and electrostatic cell systems and fuel cells. Contrastingly,
the brake-specific fuel consumption (abbreviated BSFC and denoted
as ) is better than that reported for the best
reported electrical generators; compared with the data supplied in Table 2, BSFC = 135.5 g/kW
· h is reported for the General Electric 9HA combined cycle engine.26

It is noteworthy that the effect of the
self-propulsion of the
so-called camphor boat is a well-known phenomenon.27,28,30 It should be emphasized that, in our device,
there is no direct contact between camphor and water. The Marangoni
flows are due to the evaporation of camphor, followed by its adsorption
by the water/vapor interface, and not due to the dissolution of camphor.27,28,30 The evaporation of camphor is
a relatively slow process. This leads to the low expenditure of camphor
and consequently to the aforementioned high values of BSFC supplied
in Table 2. The long-lasting
nature of rotation lasting approximately a dozen of hours should be
emphasized. The rotor removes the molecules of camphor adsorbed by
the water/vapor interface, providing each time the “fresh”
water surface ready for adsorption of the next portion of camphor
molecules. This fact explains reasonably the unusually long-lasting
nature of the rotation, making it especially suitable for the small-scale
generation of electric power. The suggested system supplies the continuous
rotation of the rotor for 10–20 h, which is much better than
that reported recently in ref (30), where the supramolecular host–guest chemistry strategy
enabling prolongation of the lifetime of Marangoni flows was suggested.
The decay of the frequency of rotation of the rotors of different
lengths with time is shown in Figure 5.

Figure 5 Decay with time of the frequency of rotation of two-pole
rotors
(see Figure 2a). (A)
Various lengths L are demonstrated. (B) Change in
rotation frequency for 22 h demonstrated.

In our previous publication,24 we suggested
the following scaling law for the quasi-stationary frequency of rotation
of the rotator 1  where Δγ is the
jump in the surface tension of water due to absorption of camphor
and η is the water viscosity. It is seen from Figure 5 that the scaling dependence  qualitatively
holds for the two-pole rotors;
namely, the quasi-stationary frequency of rotation decreases with
the length of the rotor. The temporal decrease of the frequency of
rotation may be fitted with eq 2 2  where τ is the characteristic timescale of
the rotation decay established
as τ ≅10 h.

3 Conclusions
In conclusion, we report the mini-electrical generator transforming
the energy of interfacial Marangoni flows into electrical energy.
Interfacial flows are created by camphor molecules given off by the
camphor engines placed on the floating polymer rafts bearing permanent
neodymium magnets creating magnetic fields of B ≅
0.4 – 0.5 T. The absorption of camphor molecules by the water
surface gives rise to the local decrease in the surface tension, thus
giving rise to the rotation of rafts. Stationary coils immersed in
the alternative magnetic flux produce alternative electrical current.
The rather surprising long-lasting rotation of rafts is noteworthy.31−33 Rafts rotate continuously without recharging of the engines with
camphor approximately 10–20 h. The proposed mini-generator
enables diversification of fuel sources, introducing the plant-based
camphor into the list of organic fuels. The generator will work in
the absence of light when solar energy is unavailable.
