Incorporation
of nanoparticles into polymer resins has recently
attracted a significant amount of attention from researchers for the
nanoparticles’ ability to alter the properties of the resin.
Whereas graphene-based structures possess a two-dimensional honeycomb
arrangement of carbon atoms that makes them desirable for engineering
composite materials, quantum dot formulations have been primarily
used in optoelectronic applications that take advantage of quantum
confinement and size-tunable properties. Graphene and quantum dots
(GQDs) are ubiquitous in the current research literature; however,
the impact of GQD on the physical properties of polymer resins like
epoxy remains unclear. Here, we show that infusing GQD into an epoxy
polymer matrix results in (1) a 2.6-fold increase in the toughness
of the polymer resins, (2) a 2.25-fold increase in the tensile strength
of the polymer resins compared to its original tensile strength, (3)
uniform loading at weight percentages as high as 10% of the polymer
resin, (4) an 18% change to the max % increase in tensile strain compared
to that of the neat polymer resin without GQDs, even though there
is an increase in tensile strength, and (5) a 2.5-times increase in
Young’s modulus compared to that of the neat polymer resin,
all while maintaining excellent optical properties of the composite
formulation. Our results demonstrate that GQDs with dual acid and
alcohol functional groups can enable high loading percentages, which,
in turn, give rise to composite materials that are simultaneously
stronger and tougher. We believe that these GQDs, created from an
abundant source, are a starting point for new and more sophisticated
composite materials with potential in mechanical, electrical, and
photosensitive applications.

Introduction
Carbon-based nanoparticles
have attracted attention because of
their unique mechanical, electrical, thermal, and chemical properties.1 They are used in applications such as photovoltaic
devices,2 biosensors,3 drug delivery,4 field-effect
devices,5 cell targeting,6 nanocomposite fabrication,7 and
imaging,8 among many others. Of all of
the carbon nanomaterials, graphene has earned a special place due
to its superior optical, thermal, and mechanical properties.9−12 Graphene possess a single layer of carbon atoms bonded by sp2-hybridized bonds that are arranged in a two-dimensional honeycomb-like
structure.9 However, pristine graphene
has limited electronic and optical applications because of its zero
bandgap.13,14 A bandgap can be introduced into graphene
nanoparticles like graphene quantum dots (GQDs) and graphene nanoribbons
through modifications that introduce quantum confinement and edge
effects.12

GQDs, a subset of graphene-based
nanomaterials, have a few layers
of graphene stacked one over the other.15 GQDs have been synthesized from different source materials, such
as glucose,16 carbon fibers,15 carbon nanotubes (CNTs),17 graphite,18 and coal.19A synthesis approach like lithography has been
employed to reduce graphene nanoribbons to GQDs.20 However, the process is expensive and not suitable for
largescale production. Other facile approaches include hydrothermal21 and electrochemical methods.22 Oxidative cutting has emerged as a cheap alternative to
the above methods, in which coal is used to generate GQDs.23

Epoxy resins are high-performance thermosetting
polymers with broad
applications in insulators, composites, coatings, floorings, adhesives,
and so forth.24 However, they have limited
applications due to their brittleness.25 Nanoparticles have paved the way for engineering the properties
of polymer matrices.26 A number of studies
have infused epoxy with fillers such as nanoclay,27 silica,28 CNTs,29 graphene oxide (GO),26,30−32 graphene platelets,33 nanodiamonds,34 and so forth. Epoxy/nanoparticle composites
have been investigated for years, and considerable enhancement in
their electrical, thermal, and mechanical properties has been observed
at lower concentrations of the nanomaterials in the matrix.35 Recent work has demonstrated that graphene-based
composites are able to offer strength enhancements similar to those
by CNTs at lower weight loadings.36 One
of the most important factors affecting the performance of nanocomposites
is the interface between the polymer matrix and nanofiller, as it
affects the uniformity of dispersion and weight loading of the filler.37 This has been overcome by incorporating the
graphene nanoparticles into the polymer by means of covalent or noncovalent
chemical modification.38,39 In this work, GQDs were synthesized
from cheap and readily abundant bird charcoal through oxidative cutting,
which resulted in a new, unique form of GQDs. During the synthesis,
the bird charcoal gets broken down into GQDs in either of two configurations,
zig-zag and armchair, as shown in Scheme 1. In addition, oxygen-containing functional
groups were introduced, making them soluble in aqueous solvents.

Experimental Methods
Initially, 300 mg of bird charcoal was suspended in a solution
of conc. sulfuric acid (60 mL) and conc. nitric acid (20 mL) and sonicated
for 2 h in a water bath. The resultant mixture was then heated in
a paraffin oil bath for 24 h at the specified synthesis temperature,
that is, either 70 or 85 °C or 100 or 115 °C. The heated
mixture was allowed to cool to ambient temperature and diluted with
100 mL of ice. Neutralization of this mixture was initiated by adding
3 M NaOH until the pH reached 7. During neutralization, the beaker
was kept in an ice bath to counter the heat effects of the exothermic
reaction. A 0.45 mm poly(tetrafluoroethylene) syringe filter was used
to perform the initial filtration of the neutralized sample. Then,
the sample was dialyzed using a 1 kDa Cellu Sep H1 semipermeable membrane
for further filtration. After filtration, a rotary evaporator was
used to concentrate the sample to get GQDs.

The GQDs were infused
into the epoxy matrix via in situ polymerization
to form epoxy–GQD (E–GQD) composites at different weight
loadings, as shown in Table 1. Tetrahydrofuran-dispersed GQDs and epoxy were mixed by mechanical
stirring for 45 min, followed by ultrasonication for 30 min. Vacuum
degassing at room temperature was performed to remove residual solvent
and air bubbles from the mixture. The curing agent (10 wt %), Epikure
3234, was added to the resultant E–GQD mixture and sonicated
for 5 min. Later, vacuum degassing was done to remove any air bubble
entrapment prior to curing. Finally, the E–GQDs mixture was
cured in an aluminum mold at room temperature for 24 h and postcured
at 80 °C for 4 h. Along with weight loadings, GQDs of different
sizes were also used as fillers to examine the properties of the E–GQD
composite in detail. As the GQDs act as functionalized graphene nanoparticles,
the presence of oxygen, amine groups, and aromatic rings can help
them bond with epoxy. In addition, the epoxy functional group in GQDs
help them bond directly with the curing agent. Apart from these chemical
bonds, there may also be physical interactions, such as hydrogen bonding
and van der Waals interactions. Scheme 2 highlights the interaction of GQDs with epoxy and
the curing agent. It should also be taken into consideration that
the rough and wrinkled surface of GQDs might enhance the mechanical
interlocking and adhesion with epoxy.

Results and Discussion
To analyze the chemical, structural, and optical properties of
GQDs, various GQD samples with a uniform concentration of 2.2 mg/mL
were prepared. The as-synthesized GQDs were characterized by transmission
electron microscopy (TEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), and Fourier
transform infrared (FTIR). Figure 1a shows the TEM image of bird charcoal (see Figures S1 and S2 for TEM images of GQDs). HRTEM
of GQDs showed a uniform lattice fringe of 0.24 nm corresponding to
a pristine graphene as shown in Figure 1b. GQDs synthesized at different temperatures were
analyzed, and it was found out that the height of the GQDs decreased
when the synthesis temperature increased, as shown in Figure 1c (see Figure S3 for AFM images of GQDs and Table S2 for the size distribution). The height of GQDs synthesized
at 70 °C was 34.9 ± 9.15 nm and decreased to 2.49 ±
1.67 nm at 115 °C, suggesting that the GQDs at 115 °C would
have one–three layers of graphene. There may be some thicker
layered GQDs present depending on the sample, but most of the samples
measured at 115 °C are within the one- to three-layer range.
As shown in Figure 1d, it can be noticed that the D- and G-bands have shifted to a lower
wavelength for smaller GQDs compared that of the larger GQDs. It can
also be observed that the ID/IG for larger GQDs is higher than for the smaller GQDs,
suggesting that the larger GQDs have more defects at its edges. In
addition, the full width at half-maximum (FWHM) was also observed
to be greater for smaller GQDs, suggesting that the smaller GQDs might
have fewer defects and are of higher quality (see Figure S4 for the FWHM plot of different GQD samples). This
observation coincided well with the AFM results, which demonstrate
that the size variability decreased with decreasing size of the GQDs.
FTIR spectra were obtained for charcoal and GQDs (100 °C) to
study the changes in their chemical composition. From Figure 1e, it can be noticed that functional
groups like C–O, C=O, O–H, and CO2H were present in GQDs, indicating that they were functionalized
with carbonyl, hydroxyl, and carboxylic groups during the synthesis
process. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) results of the
C1s regions of GQDs were obtained and plotted in Figure 1f (see Figure S5 for XPS spectrum of as-synthesized GQDs at 100 °C).
The multiple peaks could be fit with C–C, carboxyl, and carbonyl
functional groups at binding energies of 284.4, 288.5, and 287.4 eV,
respectively. The FTIR and XPS results were found to be in agreement.
From the photoluminescence (PL) spectra of GQDs, it can be observed
that the emission maxima of >3 kD GQDs are red-shifted 11 nm from
those of 1–3 kD GQDs as shown in Figure 1g (see Figures S6 and S7 for the PL spectrum of as-synthesized GQDs at 100 °C).
It can be understood that the probability of near-infrared emission
is greater for larger GQDs. The absorbance of GQDs increased as their
size decreased, as shown in Figure 1h. These results show that the size of the GQDs could
affect their absorption properties and that larger GQDs absorb at
longer wavelengths. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectra were obtained
for the GQDs synthesized at 100 °C, and the results showed that
the peak for GQDs shifted to a lower degree relative to that of a
bird charcoal, as observed in Figure 1i. This suggests that the interlayer spacing in GQDs
is larger than that of bird charcoal, which could be due to the breakdown
and oxidation of bird charcoal.

The E–GQD composites were
fabricated by infusing non-size-separated
GQDs synthesized at 85 °C with a concentration of 2.2 mg/mL into
an epoxy resin at different weight fractions (0–10 wt %). The
detailed composition of the composites is mentioned in the Supporting Information. An Instron Universal
Testing Machine (Instron 33R4204) was used to perform the tensile
test at room temperature and a constant displacement rate of 5 mm/min.
The samples were rectangular in shape and were 150 mm long, 25 mm
wide, and 7 mm thick. It was found that the addition of GQDs had increased
the strength, modulus of elasticity, and nominal strain at break of
epoxy (see Table S3 for the tabulation
of the raw values of tensile strength, modulus of elasticity, and
nominal strain at break). Figure 2a shows the composite fabricated at different concentrations
of GQDs. Figure 2c
shows the stress–strain curve of neat epoxy and its composites.
The tensile strength, modulus of elasticity, and nominal strain at
break were calculated from the obtained stress–strain curve.
From Figure 2d, it
can be noticed that the addition of GQDs increased the strength of
epoxy initially but decreased after 2.5 wt %. The tensile strength
of neat epoxy was 12.5 MPa, which increased to 28.1 MPa at 2.5 wt
% and then reduced to 17.2 MPa at 10 wt %. It is believed that the
presence of rigid fillers restricts planar motion and elongation,
thus causing a decrease in the tensile stress at higher concentrations.
The corresponding toughness values for loadings 0, 1, 2.5, 5, and
10 wt % are 22.4, 59, 56.6, 37.5, and 17.9 J/m3, respectively.
They were determined from the area under the curve of the representative
curves in Figure 2c
and were calculated from an interpolated function.

images of (f) neat epoxy, (g) 1 wt % E–GQDs, (h) 2.5 wt % E–GQDs,
(i) 5 wt % E–GQDs, and (j) 10 wt % E–GQDs.

The modulus of elasticity increased steadily with
increasing weight
fraction. This is consistent with the fact that the GQDs are expected
to be stiffer than the polymer, so their addition to the epoxy will
result in stiffer composites. It was observed that the addition of
10 wt % of GQDs has increased the modulus of elasticity of epoxy by
153%. Like the tensile strength, the nominal strain at break increased
initially and decreased at higher loadings, as shown in Figure 2e. Generally, percolation behavior
and the quality of the interface between the filler and the epoxy
as well as the dispersion of the fillers play important roles in determining
the mechanical properties of the composites. AFM analyses were performed
on the different E–GQD composites. Signs of agglomeration at
higher loadings can be observed from Figure 2f–j. The formation of agglomerates
could be due to the nonuniform dispersion of GQDs at higher loadings,
which causes the composites to fail early. Under uniform dispersion,
the stress transfer is effective, leading to a stronger composite.
The surface roughness measured from these AFM images was found to
decrease at higher loadings, as shown in Figure 2e.

The impact of GQDs on the epoxy
was validated by comparing it with
that of other nanoparticles such as CNTs,29 GO,26,30−32 silica,28 nanoclay,27 and graphene platelets.33 It was found that the GQDs were able to enhance
the properties of epoxy by 2.3-fold, whereas 90% of other nanoparticles
were able to enhance by only 1.3× as shown in Figure 3a. In addition, a higher uniformity
in dispersion was achieved by our method compared to that of the other
nanoparticles (e.g., 10 wt % compared to 3 wt %). Similar results
were observed in the modulus of elasticity as well. The GQDs made
the epoxy stiffer by 2.5 times compared to 1.3× for all other
nanomaterials, as shown in Figure 3b.

Figure 3 (a) Comparison of the ultimate tensile strength of different
nanoparticles
relative to neat epoxy, demonstrating that the GQDs provided better
enhancement. (b) Comparison of moduli of elasticity of composites
of different nanoparticles relative to those of neat epoxy reveals
that GQDs made the epoxy stiffer compared to that of all other nanoparticles.
The GQDs are highlighted in the purple shaded area of both graphs.

On the basis of the commonly accepted
Lerf–Klinowski model,
carboxylic acid and carbonyl groups are present at the edges of GO;
epoxide and hydroxyl groups are present at the basal planes.39,40 Accordingly, the GQDs synthesized in the present study should have
carboxylic acid groups mostly at the edges of GQDs. These carboxylic
groups not only aid in uniform dispersion, but can also form covalent
bonds with the epoxy matrix.41 We believe
that on the origin of the strengthening lies the uniform dispersion
and strong bonding between the GQDs and epoxy matrix. Compared to
that for the composites containing large graphene/GO sheets/platelets,
the area of the edges for GQDs is much larger, hence the large number
of covalent bonds with the matrix. These strong bonds at the edges
can provide better in-plane load transfer to the graphene layers.
In addition, the bonding between the matrix and the basal planes of
GQDs strengthens the nanocomposite by van der Waals bonds, hydrogen
bonds between the carbonyl groups and epoxy,42 and covalent bonds between the epoxide groups and the curing agent.

Toughening in GQD nanocomposites depends on the damage mechanisms
in the epoxy, the GQD, and the interphase between the GQD and the
epoxy. Numerical studies showed that shear yielding at the interphase
can use more than 20% of the strain energy for particles smaller than
20 nm, assuming rigid particles.43 Consequently,
we expect toughening due to interphase yielding especially for GQDs
synthesized at ≥85 °C. Experimental studies on silica-nanoparticle-reinforced
epoxy, with a mean particle size of 20 nm, showed that the dominant
toughening mechanisms are the localized shear bands near the silica
particles due to stress concentrations and plastic void growth assisted
by the particle debonding.44 Being in the
same size range as silica, GQDs are expected to increase toughness
through the same mechanisms, localized shear bands and plastic void
growth. In addition, GQDs can deform especially under shear stress
due to the low shear strength. However, the relative contributions
of these damage mechanisms are unclear. A better understanding of
the effects of GQDs on the mechanical properties of epoxy nanocomposites
requires in-depth characterization of GQDs’ functional groups,
size, shape, and spatial distribution, as well as computational approaches
to identify molecular-level behavior.45−47

Conclusions
In
conclusion, we have synthesized the E–GQD composite by
in situ polymerization with better homogeneity and dispersion. The
influence of GQDs on the tensile strength of epoxy was investigated.
Adding 2.5 wt % GQDs to epoxy increased the tensile strength, Young
modulus, and nominal strain at break by 125, 153.4, and 18.1%, respectively.
The importance of uniformity of dispersion of GQDs in epoxy was highlighted
by a steady increase in their Young modulus. The decrease in tensile
strength at higher weight loadings can be ascribed to the formation
of GQD agglomerates, that is, the GQDs formed secondary bonding interactions
between themselves rather than the primary bonding with epoxy. The
combination of better processing techniques with superior mechanical
properties makes GQDs a great candidate to the fabrication of multifunctional
polymer composites with wide array of polymer resins.
