Topological
defects in liquid crystals (LCs) have been intensively
studied and intentionally generated in an organized way recently because
they could control the alignment and motion of LCs. We studied how
the topological defects could change the molecular orientation/alignment
from the observation of photo-induced orientation change of a photo-responsive
LC. The photo-induced dynamics was observed by an LED-induced time-resolved
polarization/phase microscopy with white light illumination. From
the color image sequence, we found that the molecular orientation
change started from the topological defects and the orientation change
propagated as a pair of defects and was connected, and further disordering
was induced as a next step after the initial orientation change finished.

Introduction
Topological defects for liquid crystals
(LCs) are the positions
where the molecular orientation cannot be defined and are easily found
when LCs are placed in a cell without an alignment layer. There are
various types of topological defects, and they are categorized by
the topological charge, which is determined by the rotational angle
of molecules around each defect. At these positions, elastic energy
is higher than those in neat alignment, which could be understood
from Frank’s free energy.1

In recent years, much attention has been given on the topological
defects for LCs; they can be intentionally generated by the photoalignment
layer and the LC alignment can be controlled.2,3 Nelson
et al. demonstrated LC-made optics on a photoalignment layer and developed
various holographic optics.4,5 Hu et al. developed
a photopatterning by using a DMD-based system to demonstrate an optics
for optical vortices.6,7 Orihara et al. demonstrated the
pattern of topological defects without using the photoalignment layer8 and stabilized the pattern by polymerization.9 The structural control of azobenzene-based LC
polymer by light was theoretically studied.10 Furthermore, the alignment of LC molecules can be utilized for the
application of active matter, which means the spontaneous motion of
an object due to various physical, chemical, and biological energy
sources.11−13 The motion of self-propelled bacteria was controlled
around the topological defects prepared on a patterned LC.14 A vesicle including active molecules showed
a shape change induced by the motion of topological defects.15 In recent years, it was reported that the growth
and collective motion of biological cells is dominated by the property
of topological orientation of cells.16,17 These studies
strongly indicate that the motion of LC-like aligned molecules is
determined by the properties of topological defects. It is possibly
because the topological defects have the origin of the molecular change
due to the high cost of their elastic energy and also LC molecules
have a long-range molecular interaction.

On the other hand,
we have studied the photo-induced change of
photo-responsive LCs and could observe the photo-induced change of
the topological defects. For double emulsions made of LC as a shell,
the photo-induced phase transition was induced, and the phase change
always occurred from the center of a topological defect.18 Also, we have found the photo-induced motion
of an LC droplet inside a surfactant solution, where the defect position
was oriented toward the light source.19

In this study, we intentionally generated topological defects
inside
a planer cell without an alignment layer, and the photo-induced molecular
orientation change was observed under the polarization/phase microscope
with a millisecond time resolution. By the observation of color image
sequences and the analysis of spectral response, we investigated how
the molecular orientation change proceeded around the topological
defects.

Results and Discussion
The transmittance spectra for
the LC orientation at different angles
to the analyzer direction are shown in Figure 1a, calculated based on the theory section.
In this simulation, the wavelength dependences of the extraordinary
and ordinary refractive indexes were obtained from the literature.20 When the LC orientation angle is larger or smaller
than 45 degrees, the transmittance becomes smaller. This is the origin
of the pattern formation of topological defects, where the orientation
of LC molecules rotates 360 degrees around the topological defects
for +1 or −1 charge, and the bright and dark regions are repeated
as the orientation angle changes. However, the spectral shape does
not depend on the LC orientation angle and it depends on the refractive
indexes of the LC and the thickness of the LC layer. The large oscillation
feature in the spectrum is originated from the optical interference
due to the thin LC layer. Typically, the pattern around a defect is
formed because the transmittance is modulated as the orientation angle
changes around the defect as shown in Figure 1a. Since the transmittance is modulated in
a similar way for different wavelengths, the spatial pattern of topological
defects should be the same for different colors. The difference of
the patterns for different colors indicates that the refractive index
and/or the wavelength dependence of the refractive index around defects
were different from the values for neat LCs.

Figure 1 (a) Transmittance spectra
for different angles to the analyzer
are shown. (b) Spectral change was calculated for disorder, rotation,
and density change of a liquid crystal layer.

Here, we assumed three types of molecular orientation change induced
by the photoisomerization: Disordering, rotation, and density change.
The disordering indicates that the molecular direction becomes random,
meaning the decrease in the order parameter. The rotation indicates
that the director axis rotates to the analyzer direction, and the
density change indicates the decrease in the molecular density due
to disordering. The effects on the spectral transmittance for these
three factors were simulated; in the disordering, it was assumed that
the extraordinary refractive index decreases, while the ordinary refractive
index increases, in the rotation, the molecular axis to the polarizer
was rotated, and in the density change, both the extraordinary and
ordinary refractive index was decreased. In the simulation, arbitrary
change of the refractive index change and the rotation angle were
assumed (Δn = 0.005, Δα = 10 degrees),
the transmittance before and after the change was calculated, and
the trasmittance difference after the change was calculated to see
the spectral shape change due to each process (it is noted that the
amplitude and the sign of change do not give a physical insight because
they depend on the assumption of Δn values
or the sign of Δα). The result is shown in Figure1b. Because the oscillating feature
of transmittance spectrum is shifted or changed in amplitude by the
refractive index and the orientation angle, the subtracted spectrum
shows positive/negative values. In the disordering process, the spectral
response showed different signs dependent on the wavelength, while
the spectral change showed the same sign for the entire wavelength
region for the rotation process, and the density change showed a very
little change even for the same order of the refractive index change
as the disordering.

Most of the defects in the samples showed
a pattern with four brushes,
indicating that they had +1 or −1 charge before the light irradiation.
However, various different patterns were found when the multiple defects
were nearby. An example is shown in Figure 2. There was a strong transmittance between
two defects in the red image, and bright double spots were observed
near each defect for the green image, and another connected region
became brighter in the blue image. Unexpectedly, the patterns were
different for the observed colors. As mentioned in the Theory and Method section , the patterns should be same for
different colors if the refractive indexes around the defects do not
have different values from those for the neat LC. The difference from
the typical four-brush pattern indicates that the refractive indexes
were varied in space around the topological defects. Furthermore,
the pattern difference for different colors (wavelengths) means that
the refractive index nearby the topological defects had different
spatial dependences on the wavelength. The detailed analyses on the
refractive indexes on the wavelength and the position for the static
conditions are necessary in the near future.

Figure 2 The photo-induced change
of the image sequences for red, green,
and blue colors are shown. The “R”, “G”,
and “B” indicate the red, green, and blue image sequences,
respectively. The pump light was illuminated from 0 to 2000 ms, and
the bottom number corresponds to the time after the pump light was
illuminated. The temperature of the sample was set at 40.0 °C.
The scale bar corresponds to 30 μm.

To observe the photo-induced image change around the topological
defects, several experimental parameters were optimized for observation:
The temperature, the pump light intensity, and the duration, etc.
When the pump light was turned on, the image changed to a small extent
for several hundred milliseconds and returned to the original image
on the similar timescale when the pump light was turned off. By the
illumination of the pump light for 2000 ms with an interval of 5000
ms, this pattern change was repeated. In this study, the image change
during the pump illumination was discussed in detail.

One of
the typical responses is shown in Figure 2 for the wavelength regions of red, green,
and blue from the top to the bottom, respectively. In these image
sequences, two topological defects were recognized, which correspond
to +1 and −1 topological charge. When the pump light was irradiated,
a slight change of the intensity and pattern was observed.

To
visualize the weak change, the initial image before the pump
irradiation was subtracted from each image of the sequence. Hereinafter,
the image is called a “subtraction image.” Figure 3 shows the subtraction
images corresponding to Figure 2. In the image sequence for red and green, a connection line
between the two defects appeared around 20 ms at first, (Figure 2, dotted regions
at 20 ms) the other lines outside the initial line gradually grew
and connected the two defects in a few hundred milliseconds. However,
it is noted that the bright line connecting two defects for the shortest
distance was bright for both red and green images but the outer region
showed the opposite change in sign. In the image sequence for green,
the bright and dark parts appeared around the defects and they were
connected. In the image sequence for blue, the change was weaker than
the others.

Figure 3 The subtraction image sequences are shown. The “R”,
“G”, and “B” indicates the red, green,
and blue image sequences, respectively. The images were obtained by
subtracting the image intensity before the pump light illumination
from the images corresponding to Figure 2. The dotted regions were highlighted because
of the characteristic changes, as described in the text.

Another typical example is shown in Figure 4 (Top: original, Bottom: subtraction). In
the sequence for the red subtraction images, a bright line connecting
between two defects appeared at 50 ms, as was similar in Figure 3. (Figure 4b, dotted region at 50 ms),
and the lines outside the initial line grew to connect the two defects
in the red and blue images indicated in the dotted regions at 200
ms of Figure 4b. Again,
the color contrast of the
secondary connecting lines was opposite for the red and blue images,
while the initial connecting lines were bright for the red and blue
images. In the sequence for the green subtraction images, a local
change was observed only around defects. The flip of the color contrast
indicates that disordering is involved in the photo-induced process,
as was explained in the theory section. The minor difference of the
color contrast dependence of Figures 3 and 4 is possibly due to the
local thickness difference, which causes the shift in the spectra
shown in Figure 1.

Figure 4 (a) Photo-induced
change of the image sequences are shown. The
“R”, “G”, and “B” indicates
the red, green, and blue image sequences, respectively. The pump light
was illuminated from 0 to 200 ms, and the bottom number corresponds
to the time after the pump light was illuminated. The temperature
of the sample was set at 35.0 °C. The scale bar corresponds to
30 μm. (b) Subtraction images for (a) is shown. The images were
obtained by subtracting the image intensity before the pump light
illumination from the images corresponding to (a). The dotted regions
were highlighted because of the characteristic changes, as described
in the text.

From these results, it was revealed
that the change of molecular
alignment occurred from the defect positions and spread out to connect
defects. The proposed scheme is shown in Figure 5. The UV irradiation caused photoisomerization
of MBBA (a,b) and the molecular alignment became unstable around the
defects due to the unstable points of elastic energy. Therefore, change
in molecular orientation started from the center of defects and it
extended between defects in the shortest connecting region. (c,d)
Further light illumination induced the disorder in the outer connecting
region around the initially disordered region. (e,f) Thus, molecular
orientational change and the following disordering occurred in two
steps between two defects.

Figure 5 Schematic drawing is shown to describe the mechanism
of the photo-induced
molecular alignment change in MBBA by irradiation of the pump light:
(a) before light irradiation, (b) photoisomerization of molecules,
(c) propatation of molecular orientation change, (d) connection of
the regions with orientation change, (e) secondary disordering, and
(f) formed disordered region.

Other examples when multiple defects were involved are shown in Figures 6 and 7, and the corresponding subtraction
image sequences are also shown. In the original images, the bright
connection between defects was observed in red and blue images, but
the bright regions were different for colors. For green, the defect
positions showed bright spots. In the sequence of the subtraction
images, bright connecting lines initially appeared in the red images
(Figures 6b and 7b at 50 ms), and gradually the secondary changes
connecting two defects were observed in the green images in a few
hundred milliseconds in the green images (Figures 6b and 7b at 200 ms)
but the secondary change showed an opposite contrast with red images.

Figure 6 (a) Photo-induced
change of the image sequences are shown. The
“R”, “G”, and “B” indicates
the red, green, and blue image sequences, respectively. The pump light
was illuminated from 0 to 200 ms, and the bottom number corresponds
to the time after the pump light was illuminated. The temperature
of the sample was set at 35.0 °C. The scale bar corresponds to
50 μm. (b) Subtraction images for (a) is shown. The images were
obtained by subtracting the image intensity before the pump light
illumination from the images corresponding to (a). The dotted regions
were highlighted because of the characteristic changes, as described
in the text.

Figure 7 (a) Photo-induced change of the image sequences
are shown. The
“R”, “G”, and “B” indicates
the red, green, and blue image sequences, respectively. The pump light
was illuminated from 0 to 200 ms, and the bottom number corresponds
to the time after the pump light was illuminated. The temperature
of the sample was set at 35.0 °C. The scale bar corresponds to
50 μm. (b) Subtraction images for (a) is shown. The images were
obtained by subtracting the image intensity before the pump light
illumination from the images corresponding to (a). The disordered
region is indicated in yellow. The dotted regions were highlighted
because of the characteristic changes, as described in the text.

The proposed scheme is shown in Figure 8. When there were multiple
defects, the molecular
orientation change occurred by connecting pairs of defects. The UV
irradiation caused photoisomerization of MBBA, causing an orientation
change between the defects with a pair of defects (in c), which was
connected. When the pump light was kept irradiated, the disorder expanded
in the outer region similar to the two-defects type (d–f).

Figure 8 Schematic
drawing is shown to describe the mechanism of the photo-induced
molecular alignment change in MBBA by irradiation of the pump light:
(a) before light irradiation, (b) photoisomerization of molecules,
(c) propatation of molecular orientation change, (d) connection of
the regions with orientation change, (e) secondary disordering, and
(f) formed disordered region.

Conclusions
The molecular alignment change nearby the topological defects was
observed by the photo-induced phase/polarization microscopy. We could
observe the molecular alignment change from the subtraction image
sequences and revealed the dynamic processes. From the theoretical
analysis of the spectral response, the orientational change between
the topological defects proceeded. The UV light irradiation caused
the isomerization of MBBA at first, and the molecular alignment became
unstable at the defect positions, from which the molecular orientation
was changed between the defects. This orientation change induced the
disordering by irradiating the light in multisteps. This observation
of the defect-related molecular disordering will deepen the understanding
of the molecular alignment change. Furthermore, various photomechanical
motion and shape change have been demonstrated for photo-responsive
LC systems, and this methodology would help in understanding the mechanism
of the macroscopic shape/order change of LCs based on the observation
and simulation.

Theory and Method
An optical configuration
of the equipment for this experiment is
shown in Figure 9.
This consists of a phase microscope (BX50, Olympus) with a polarization
dependent detection, where the direction-dependent refractive index
was imaged for a sample by the illumination of a white LED (Thorlabs,
SOLIS-3C) from the bottom side under the cross-Nicole condition. Another
pump light with a wavelength of 365 nm (Thorlabs, SOLIS-365C) was
illuminated from the top side to the sample after being reflected
by a dichroic mirror, the sample absorbed the pump light, causing
the molecular orientation change due to the photoisomerization reaction
of photo-responsive LC molecules. Since this change caused the direction-dependent
refractive index change in the sample, the refractive index change
could be obtained as a contrasted image by the polarization/phase
microscopy under the cross-Nicole condition. The pump light was illuminated
to a sample for 200 or 2000 ms and turned off. The photo-induced molecular
orientation change and its recovery was observed during and after
the light illumination. Acquisition of an image sequence was started
20 ms before the illumination of the pump light and the sequence of
images was acquired at a constant interval, 10 ms. Typically, 100
images (1000 ms) were stored for each cycle. After the LC recovered
to the original condition, this process was repeated and the image
sequence was stored and averaged for several times.

Figure 9 The optical configuration
of LED-induced time-resolved phase microscope.
The phase microscope was modified to have a polarization dependence
by inserting the polarizer and analyzer under a cross-Nicole condition.
The pump light was illuminated from the top side to the sample for
2000 ms and turned off. The photo-induced refractive index change
was imaged by a CMOS camera.

N-(4-methoxybenzylidene)-4-butylaniline (MBBA,
Tokyo Kasei) was used as purchased. The sample was put into an LC
cell (EHC Co.) with a sample thickness of 3 μm, with a nonrubbed
polyimide film inside. The pump light was UV-LED (SOLIS-365C, Thorlabs;
wavelength: 365 nm, intensity: 1.12 mW/cm2) and the illumination
light was white LED (SOLIS-3C, Thorlabs: intensity: 0.29 mW/cm2). A color CMOS camera (VCXU-23C, Baumer) was used for measurements
and a color image sequence was obtained, which was separated into
color image sequences: red (610 ≈ 750 nm), green (500 ≈
560 nm), and blue (435 ≈ 480 nm). The temperature was set at
either 40.0 or 35.0 °C by a temperature controller for microscopes
(TP-CHS-C, Tokai Hit). The intensity of the pump light was controlled
to suppress the phase transition.

Under the cross-Nicole condition,
no light is transmitted if an
LC is in the isotropic state or it is randomly oriented. This is because
no image is obtained for an LC without an alignment layer. However,
patterns of the topological defects appeared, because there is an
orientation to an extent around topological defects.

To understand
the color dependence of the transmittance around
topological defects, the transmittance spectrum for the cross-Nicole
condition is considered. Under the cross-Nicole condition, the transmittance
spectrum can be calculated as: 1  where n1 and n3 are the refractive index
of the top and bottom layers for an LC cell, α is the angle of the LC director to the analyzer direction, and t∥ and t⊥ correspond to the Fresnel transmittance coefficients for the light
field directions parallel and perpendicular to the molecular axis,
respectively. The wavelength dependence comes from the Fresnel transmittance
coefficient for a multilayer system. Under our experimental condition,
a thin layer of an LC with a thickness of 3 μm is sandwiched
between two glass layers. In this case, the Fresnel transmittance
coefficients are given as: 2  where t12, t23, r12, and r23 are the Fresnel transmittance
and reflectance coefficients at the interfaces between 1 and 2, and
2 and 3, respectively, and λ is the wavelength, n2, e(λ) and n2, o(λ) are the wavelength-dependent
extraordinary and ordinary refractive indexes for the LC respectively,
and d is the thickness of the LC layer. This transmittance
coefficient, t∥ and t⊥ are obtained for the light field parallel and
perpendicular to the LC director.
