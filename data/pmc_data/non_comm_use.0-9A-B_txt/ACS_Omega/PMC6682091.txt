This
work presents an original synthesis of TiO2/graphene
nanocomposites using laser pyrolysis for the demonstration of efficient
and improved perovskite solar cells. This is a one-step and continuous
process known for nanoparticle production, and it enables here the
elaboration of TiO2 nanoparticles with controlled properties
(stoichiometry, morphology, and crystallinity) directly grown on graphene
materials. Using this process, a high quality of the TiO2/graphene interface is achieved, leading to an intimate electronic
contact between the two materials. This effect is exploited for the
photovoltaic application, where TiO2/graphene is used as
an electron-extracting layer in n–i–p mesoscopic perovskite
solar cells based on the reference CH3NH3PbI3–xClx halide
perovskite active layer. A significant and reproducible improvement
of power conversion efficiencies under standard illumination is demonstrated,
reaching 15.3% in average compared to 13.8% with a pure TiO2 electrode, mainly due to a drastic improvement in fill factor. This
beneficial effect of graphene incorporation is revealed through pronounced
photoluminescence quenching in the presence of graphene, which indicates
better electron injection from the perovskite active layer. Considering
that a reduction of device hysteresis is also observed by graphene
addition, the laser pyrolysis technique, which is compatible with
large-scale industrial developments, is therefore a powerful tool
for the production of efficient optoelectronic devices based on a
broad range of carbon nano-objects.

1 Introduction
The
use of titanium dioxide (TiO2) is nowadays widespread
in many fields such as waste-water purification or photocatalysis
due to its physical properties and chemical stability. In the field
of sustainable energy, titanium dioxide has attracted more and more
interest for rechargeable batteries, supercapacitors, photocatalytic
hydrogen generation, and solar cells.1,2 More particularly,
at the nanometric scale, due to the critical contribution of active
surfaces, TiO2 offers interesting properties for many applications,
and in particular for third-generation solar cells, such as dye-sensitized,
organic, or perovskite solar cells.3,4 In this field,
a main limitation to current generation is associated with the recombination
of excitons and/or charge carriers at many different levels. Therefore,
regarding photogenerated electrons, the scientific community put many
efforts to enhance the charge extraction layers of photovoltaic devices
by synthesizing TiO2-based thin films modified with metallic
nanoparticles or carbon nanostructures.5 In particular, since the development of new synthesis methods of
graphene materials, TiO2/graphene nanocomposites showed
a strong potential to replace pure TiO2 to reach optimal
material properties for the photovoltaic application. Graphene materials
are indeed now well known for their excellent conductive properties
and high specific area, attracting strong interest for electronic
applications.6

In the field of perovskite
solar cells, high efficiencies of more
than 23% have been recently reached,7,8 but efforts
remain to be performed to improve charge extraction, especially concerning
the development of efficient and reliable charge transporting electrodes
and selective contacts. The motivation for using TiO2/graphene
nanocomposites as a mesoporous electron transport layer aims at improving
charge transfer and electron collection, thus leading to reduced charge
trapping and recombination that can occur at the surface of titanium
dioxide.9−13 These benefits rely on the possibility for efficient electron transfer
mechanisms from TiO2 to graphene, as reported in the field
of dye-sensitized solar cells.14

Among the numerous works reported over the last few years, the
study carried by Nicholas et al. clearly demonstrates the benefit
of TiO2/graphene nanocomposites as an electron transport
material in perovskite solar cells by reaching 15.6% power conversion
efficiency (PCE) for the best cell using a reference n–i–p
device configuration.15 One main benefit
of the strategy is the possibility to achieve efficient TiO2 electrode at low temperatures (<150 °C), although it requires
several independent processing steps for the preparation of graphene,
TiO2, and the final nanocomposite.

Different pathways
have been reported for the elaboration of TiO2/graphene
nanocomposites, such as the sonication of graphene
and titanium dioxide dispersions. In this case, TiO2 nanoparticles
anchor onto the graphene layers, leading to partial covering and weak
bonding between both materials.16 Other
alternatives reported in the literature include sol–gel and
hydrothermal methods, where graphene oxide is reduced in presence
of a titanium-based precursor or a solution containing dispersed TiO2 nanoparticles.16 To this date,
these procedures cannot enable the elaboration of TiO2–graphene
composites with controlled properties for both TiO2 and
graphene materials while ensuring a strong interface between them
and also leading to a high production yield.

In this work,
we present a one-step and continuous synthesis method
of TiO2/graphene nanocomposites by laser pyrolysis. Indeed,
the synthesis by laser pyrolysis of such nanocomposites is a continuous
process that leads to a production rate of several grams per hour.
Moreover, laser pyrolysis neither use any solvent nor require cleaning
or washing steps, which are inevitable in most of the other way of
production mentioned in the literature.17,18 This singular
technique enables the direct synthesis of well-controlled TiO2 nanoparticles on graphene sheets. Relevance of this process
has been previously demonstrated for TiO2/carbon nanotube
nanocomposite production, exhibiting an improved efficiency when used
as active materials in solid-state dye-sensitized solar cells.19 In this context, the present study focuses on
the morphological and structural properties of the TiO2/graphene nanocomposites synthesized by laser pyrolysis and their
integration into mesoporous (or mesoscopic) n–i–p
perovskite solar cells. A clear improvement of photovoltaic performance
is related to the intimate contact between graphene and TiO2 associated with the synthesis method, which is clearly beneficial
to charge extraction.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Physical Properties of the TiO2 and TiO2 Graphene Nanopowders
The synthesis
of TiO2/graphene nanocomposite has been performed in a
one-step method by laser pyrolysis, as described in Section 4. This very fine technique
enables a continuous production of nanoparticles that are obtained
as powders.20 Besides the excellent purity
of the materials, laser pyrolysis can also provide high production
rate (up to 3 g/h at lab scale) in the case of pure TiO2 synthesis, with no graphene addition.21 Characteristics of the obtained nanopowders (size, crystallinity)
are tuned by the choice of experimental conditions (including laser
power, reactor pressure, and gas flow rate).22 We aim at producing particles as small as possible so that the specific
surface, hence interfacial interactions, will be maximized. Experimental
parameters have been carefully chosen to favor the production of anatase
phase.22 Pure TiO2 nanoparticles
were synthesized by laser pyrolysis as a reference material from pure
titanium (IV) isopropoxide (TTIP). To produce TiO2/graphene
nanocomposites, 0.04 wt % reduced graphene oxide (rGO) was dispersed
into TTIP using ultrasounds and the suspension was carried out to
the laser beam. The obtained nanocomposite-based powder is then labeled
as 0.04G/TiO2.

These as-formed powders obtained from
the laser pyrolysis are of gray color. This gray color is attributed
to a significant amount of residual carbon phases (25%) due to the
decomposition of the precursors (TTIP and C2H4). Therefore, annealing under air (6 h at 430 °C) was systematically
performed to remove this carbon as it is known to alter the electronic
properties of the obtained materials. The annealing temperature was
carefully determined from thermogravimetric analysis, which is presented
in the Supporting Information (Figure S1), to avoid graphene combustion while ensuring amorphous carbon elimination.
After annealing, the color of powders turn to white, as depicted in Figure S2 in the Supporting Information.

The annealed powders were then thoroughly analyzed, and we especially
focus here on two samples referred as TiO2 and 0.04G/TiO2 samples, whose main characteristics are presented in Table 1.

The morphologies of the powders have
been first studied by scanning
electron microscopy (SEM). Figure 1a shows an overview of the general aspect of the powders
and confirms good homogeneity of the samples. Moreover, through meticulous
analysis, we were able to distinguish graphene sheets within the TiO2 matrix for sample 0.04G/TiO2. Figure 1b shows a SEM image centered
on a graphene sheet at a higher magnification. Within the powder,
graphene is present in a small amount (considering that 0.04 wt %
of graphene was introduced in the precursor mixture prior to the laser
pyrolysis process) and is surrounded by TiO2 nanoparticles;
therefore, most of the TiO2/graphene layers appear covered
by a high amount of TiO2 nanoparticles and cannot be easily
seen through SEM characterization. Besides, TiO2 particles
seem to be very small as they reach the resolution limit of the microscope.
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was therefore performed to
get into more details.

within the TiO2 nanoparticle powder at different magnitudes.

TEM images of the TiO2/graphene nanocomposite obtained
by laser pyrolysis (0.04G/TiO2).

Figure 1c
shows
the TEM image of as-received graphene, before laser pyrolysis. Its
transparency emphasizes that only few carbon layers are involved,
leading to very thin graphene sheets. This morphology seems to be
preserved after the nanocomposite synthesis and after annealing, as
shown in Figure 1d.
As we can see, graphene is completely covered by TiO2 nanoparticles,
as one can only distinguish the edges of the graphene layer. For TEM
observations, as mentioned in Section 4, the preparation of the microscope grids involves
dispersion of the powders into ethanol using a high-power ultrasonic
probe to separate the particles. Despite this treatment, a good coverage
of graphene by titania particles is observed, which suggests a good
quality of interface between the two materials. We highlight here
that the quality of the interface between TiO2 nanoparticles
and carbon nanotubes synthesized by laser pyrolysis was already pointed
out by our previous work,19 which shows
an intimate electronic contact between the two constituents. However,
while carbon nanotubes are highly robust in terms of mechanical and
thermal properties, graphene is much more sensitive to such stress.
Achieving an intimate interface with TiO2 without significantly
altering the aspect of the graphene sheets is therefore an additional
benefit of the laser pyrolysis process in our opinion, which remains
difficult to achieve using other preparation methods.

In addition,
complementary X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements
on the two powders are presented in Figure 2a, as well as their corresponding diffraction
patterns.

Figure 2 (a) XRD images of TiO2 (pure TiO2) and 0.04G/TiO2 (TiO2/graphene) nanopowders and (b), (c) their
respective diffraction patterns (JCPDS card nos. 21-1272, 21-1276,
and 84-1750). (d) Raman spectra of TiO2 and 0.04G/TiO2 focusing on the specific TiO2 signatures.

For both materials, the major
phase present is anatase, although
a small fraction of rutile is also present (see Table 1). The average size of the crystallites is
evaluated to be between 10 and 15 nm from Scherrer’s equation,23,24 showing that TiO2 particles can be polycrystalline as
the mean particle size evaluated by the Brunauer, Emmet and Teller
(BET) method is around 20 nm (as reported in Table 1). A comparison of the two diagrams emphasizes
the presence of several additional peaks in the 0.04G/TiO2 nanocomposite. This phase can be attributed to the orthorhombic
TiO2-II phase, also named srilankite. This result is confirmed
by Raman spectra recorded for pure TiO2 and 0.04G/TiO2 samples, as shown in Figure 2d. Besides the anatase signatures at 395, 516, and
634 cm–1, clear signatures of srilankite TiO2-II are evidenced at 282, 314, 354, and 424 cm–1 in the case of the 0.04G/TiO2 sample. This phase is observed
in all TiO2/graphene nanocomposites produced using our
laser pyrolysis process. Usually, the TiO2-II is formed
under high pressures and its structure is of the α-PbO2 type. In this work, this phase is observed only when graphene is
present in the reaction. We therefore assume that the presence of
graphene, although in less amount, does change the synthesis conditions.
Graphene would induce the creation of a reductive atmosphere that
reduces a small fraction of anatase or rutile phase formed within
the reactor during the laser pyrolysis. This TiO2-II phase
was also reported in another work25 that
uses a flame synthesis method to synthesize TiO2 particles
and produces a small fraction of TiO2-II (srilankite) under
oxygen-lean conditions. In addition, as graphene is not detectable
by XRD, further information about the composite properties has been
investigated by Raman scattering and is presented in the Supporting
Information (Figure S3). The investigations
performed by Raman spectroscopy confirm the presence of graphene within
the nanopowders. They also show a significant increase of the D-to-G
band ratio in the composite compared to that in pristine graphene,
which suggests that defects have been introduced through the pyrolysis
process or through close interactions of the graphene sheets with
TiO2 nanoparticles. This fact is consistent with the observations
made by TEM.

We highlight here that these characterizations
confirm the good
crystallization of TiO2 in the anatase form and the presence
of graphene in our nanocomposites powder. Moreover, especially through
TEM analysis, the interface between TiO2 and graphene seems
to be intimate, which is thus very promising for our application,
as it can be associated with a good electronic contact.

2.2 From Powders to Mesoporous Electrodes
Mesoporous TiO2 and TiO2/graphene electron
transport layers were fabricated from the nanopowders synthesized
by laser pyrolysis. A suspension of TiO2 or TiO2/graphene powder was prepared in ethanol at a weight ratio of 1:30
with regard to the solvent. Then, α-terpineol and ethyl-cellulose
(previously dissolved in absolute ethanol) were added, following conventional
recipes already published.19,26 The obtained paste
is sonicated for 1 h and stirred overnight before being spin-coated
in air at 4000 rpm for 60 s and various substrates. The deposited
films are then progressively annealed up to 430 °C to remove
all of the organic components, leaving a high porosity and a mesoporous
structure. Finally, the porous films are treated with TiCl4 that is known to improve the surface states of nanostructured titania
while improving the electronic percolation of adjacent particles,
influencing consequently charge recombination and transport in the
electrode (see the Supporting Information for experimental details).27−30

The main issue regarding the TiO2/graphene composite is associated with the narrow thermal window
that can be exploited for the post-sintering of the TiO2 layers, required to remove the organic additives. The SEM cross
section of the mesoporous TiO2/graphene layer obtained
after sintering at 430 °C is presented in Figure 3a.

Figure 3 SEM cross section of the TiO2/graphene
mesoporous layer
deposited on glass (a) before and (b) after perovskite (CH3NH3PbI3–xClx) infiltration.

The SEM image clearly demonstrates the achievement of a high-porosity
film, similar to those generally reported using such recipes.31,32 The absence of large aggregates is associated with a high transparency
of the layers in the visible region (>90%) with almost no contribution
from scattering, as observed by eye or through UV–visible transmission
spectroscopy (Figure 4a). This observation is crucial to ensure that most of the incoming
light reaches the perovskite material (the solar absorber) that will
be infiltrated in the mesoporous electrode, as described in the next
step.

layer based on TiO2 and 0.04G/TiO2 powders and
top-coated by perovskite. (b) Tauc’s plot of TiO2/perovskite and 0.04G/TiO2/perovskite.

We also note that the presence of graphene does
not change the
optical properties of our mesoporous layers, considering the low amount
used here.

The CH3NH3PbI3–xClx (MAPI-Cl) perovskite
is deposited
on top of this layer in a one-step process, described in Section 4 and Supporting Information (experimental details). Figure 3b shows that the
pores of our TiO2-based layers are well filled by the perovskite,
ensuring a good interface between the two materials so that efficient
electron injection can take place. UV–visible spectra of infiltrated
TiO2 and 0.04G/TiO2-based mesoporous layers
are reported in Figure 4a and shows the expected contributions of the metal oxide electrode
and the perovskite layer (absorption edge close to 790 nm in our case).
From this UV–visible spectra and using Tauc’s equation
(Figure 4b), the perovskite
band gap is evaluated at 1.56 eV in both cases. We therefore assume
that the presence of graphene does not significantly affect the perovskite
crystallization.

Steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy
was conducted
to better investigate the photoinduced charge transfer mechanisms
at the TiO2 layer/perovskite interface, as a function of
the presence of graphene. A comparison was made with the pristine
perovskite layer deposited on a mesoporous Al2O3 thin film, which acts as an insulating scaffold preventing any charge
transfer process. A quenching of the perovskite photoluminescence
emission (centered at 792 nm) is evidenced in the presence of a TiO2-based electron transport layer, indicating that both TiO2 and TiO2/graphene materials can efficiently collect
electrons photogenerated in the perovskite (Figure 5). Moreover, this quenching is significantly
enhanced in the presence of graphene, which indicates a better electron
transfer efficiency compared to our pure TiO2 reference.
This observation is further confirmed through transient photoluminescence
measurements presented in Figure S4 in
the Supporting Information, which shows a significantly faster PL
decay kinetics in the presence of graphene compared to pure TiO2. Although there is still a debate in the literature about
the relevance of mesoporous Al2O3 films as noninjecting
reference substrates, the PL analysis clearly confirms that a better
electronic interaction occurs between the perovskite and the graphene-loaded
TiO2 electrode compared to pure TiO2.

layer (Al2O3) and an electron transport layer

2.3 From Mesoporous Electrodes to Photovoltaic
Devices and Performance Measurements
Finally, the mesoporous
TiO2 layers, with and without graphene, were used as electron
transport layers in perovskite solar cells using a glass-fluorine
doped tin oxide (FTO)/dense TiO2/mesoporous TiO2 (without or with graphene)/MAPI-Cl perovskite/Spiro-OMeTAD/Au n–i–p
architecture (see Figure S5b in the Supporting
Information). A preliminary analysis on the influence of the graphene
content in TiO2 was conducted by adding cells containing
an intermediate amount of graphene (0.02 wt %) for the comparison
(the sample is labeled as 0.02G/TiO2). Further details
of the experimental procedure used for device preparation are reported
in Section 4 and Supporting
Information. Figure S5a presents the SEM
cross section of a full device, showing that the expected sandwich
structure is obtained.

Figure 6a–c represents typical current density–voltage
(J–V) curves obtained from
backward current–voltage characteristics measured under simulated
solar emission (standard conditions, see experimental details in the Supporting Information) of perovskite solar cells
based on TiO2, 0.02G/TiO2, and 0.04G/TiO2 porous electrode. Table 2 presents the corresponding photovoltaic parameters
(power conversion efficiency (PCE), short-circuit current density
(Jsc), open-circuit voltage (Voc), and fill factor (FF)), including those extracted
from the forward J–V sweep.
We emphasize that these parameters are average values obtained from
a limited number of devices that were processed in similar conditions
for this study. It is important to note that the cells show significant
hysteresis effect between forward and backward scans. This effect
is mainly attributed to ionic migrations (mainly halides) in the perovskite
layer, which can be directly affected by the charge extractions layers
(either for electrons and holes).33 Furthermore,
it is also generally associated with interfacial defect states, as
suggested by recent numerical simulation of perovskite solar cells.34 Our mesoscopic device architecture, based on
MAPI-Cl, is particularly sensitive to hysteresis as generally reported
in the literature. Therefore, an adimensional hysteric index (HI),
established by Sanchez et al., is also presented in Table 2.35 HI is comprised between 0 (no hysteresis) and 1 (strong hysteresis).

0.04G/TiO2	15.3 ± 0.1	22.3 ± 0.1	0.93 ± 0.01	74 ± 0	0.07 ± 0.02	
In general, we clearly observe the improvement of solar cell performance
with the increase of the graphene content. A high FF up to 74% (compared
to 70% for the reference) and a decreased series resistance, from
26 to 22 Ω, are observed for cells containing graphene, evidencing
a better charge extraction ability. In addition, the Voc increases from 0.91 to 0.93 V and the short-circuit
current density measured under standard illumination increases from
21.7 to 22.3 mA/cm2 in the presence of graphene. This behavior
is compatible with a better charge collection efficiency in the case
of graphene-containing cells. This has a direct influence on power
conversion efficiencies that reach an average of 15.3% efficiency
compared to the 13.8% obtained for the reference. This trend is also
confirmed through incident photon to charge carrier efficiency (IPCE)
spectra measured on the devices, which are presented in the Supporting
Information (Figure S6). The clear improvement
of current generation over the whole spectral range is consistent
with better charge extraction efficiency in the presence of the highest
content of graphene (0.04 wt %).

Our results are consistent
with the literature, for which an optimal
graphene content exists.15,36,37 Indeed, with a quite similar architecture of cell, Han et al. incorporated
rGO into the mesoporous TiO2 layer with three different
concentrations (0.2, 0.4, and 1.0 vol %). The best content appeared
to be the intermediate one (0.4 vol %) for which an efficiency of
13.5% was obtained, compared to the 11.5% of their reference cell
(pure TiO2).

Finally, the reduction of hysteresis
in the case of TiO2/graphene-based porous electrode is
evidenced by the reduction of
the HI by a factor 2. Zhang et al. pointed out the role of interfacial
oxygen vacancies in TiO2 as a potential cause of hysteresis
in perovskite solar cells.38 Our observations
are therefore consistent with a reduction of oxygen vacancies on the
TiO2 particle surface by the introduction of graphene.
The intimate contact induced by the laser pyrolysis process between
TiO2 and graphene is crucial in this context. Another positive
influence of graphene incorporation is the fact that the standard
deviation of all photovoltaic parameters is significantly reduced
for solar cells containing the 0.04G/TiO2 composite material.
Further in-depth analyses are currently undertaken to better interpret
these effects; however, all of these indicators confirm the positive
influence of graphene on perovskite solar cell operation.

Our
first results are therefore very promising and clearly demonstrate
the relevance of the laser pyrolysis process for the production of
functional composites for energy conversion. Moreover, the optimal
graphene content remains to be determined, suggesting that further
performance improvement can be expected.

3 Conclusions
We show that laser pyrolysis enables to continuously produce TiO2/graphene nanocomposites with controlled properties (such
as TiO2 crystallinity). More importantly, the technique
provides an improved TiO2–graphene interface and
a coverage of the graphene sheets by the TiO2 nanoparticles
that induces a better electronic contact between them. Moreover, the
technique can be expanded to produce one-step nanocomposites with
different graphene contents or different graphene properties. The
high quality of the obtained nanocomposites was applied to perovskite
solar cells that exhibit a significant increase of their performance
in average in the presence of graphene compared to pure TiO2, as well as lower hysteresis. Moreover, these nanocomposites might
be of interest for the study of aging or degradation of perovskite
solar cells in which mesoporous TiO2 is known to play an
important role.39,40 More generally, these results
demonstrate the versatility of the laser pyrolysis process for the
production of high-quality graphene nanomaterials and composites for
solar energy conversion.

4 Experimental Section
To synthesize the nanocomposites, we choose a graphene material
with suitable features for our application: a high conductivity and
a few layers that offer a high specific area. Therefore, the “industrial
G-200” material produced by the SIMBATT Company was used. Indeed,
this industrial graphene powder is a reduced graphene oxide (rGO)
with an oxygen content of less than 8 at.%, providing thus a high
conductivity. Moreover, this graphene material is of a few layers
(<10 layers), leading to a high specific area (>600 m2/g). For convenience, we speak about graphene to mention this reduced
graphene oxide (rGO). The titanium precursor is liquid and is the
titanium (IV) isopropoxide 87560-500 ML (TTIP) purchased from Sigma-Aldrich
(≥97% purity).

The synthesis of the TiO2/graphene
nanocomposite has
been performed in a one-step method by laser pyrolysis. Its principle
is based on the resonant interaction between a high-power infrared
laser (CO2) and a precursor mixture that can be either
gas or liquid-nebulized microdroplets, carried into the reactor zone
thanks to an inert gas (argon).20 The TiO2/graphene powders were obtained from TTIP as a liquid precursor
for TiO2 formation (a sensitizer gas, C2H4, is added to the carrier gas in this case, as TTIP does not
absorb well the laser radiation at 10.6 μm) and our commercial
few-layered reduced graphene oxide powder (SIMBATT, Shanghai, China).
The CO2 laser power was set to 520 W, and the pressure
in the reactor was maintained at atmospheric pressure (105 Pa). Pure TiO2 nanoparticles were synthesized by laser
pyrolysis as a reference material from pure TTIP. To produce TiO2/graphene nanocomposites, 0.04 wt % of reduced graphene oxide
(rGO) was dispersed into TTIP using ultrasound. The obtained nanocomposite-based
powder is then labeled as 0.04G/TiO2.

The morphology
of the powders were then evaluated by a Carl Zeiss
ULTRA55 scanning electron microscope (SEM) and by a JEOL 2010 high-resolution
transmission electron microscope (HRTEM) operated at 200 kV. For SEM
analysis, the powder was directly observed on the carbon tape. For
HRTEM measurements, the powder was dispersed in ethanol and nanoparticles
were separated with intensive ultrasound irradiation using a Hielscher
Ultrasound Technology VialTweeter UIS250V. Then, the dispersion was
dropped on a grid made of a Lacey Carbon Film (300 mesh Copper, S166-3H).

The materials have been integrated into perovskite solar cells
and tested under standard conditions (AM1.5G, 100 mW/cm2) in ambiant atmosphere and without encapsulation to illustrate
their quality and interest. Perovskite solar cells used in this work
are composed of a stack of layers deposited onto glass substrates
(see the structure in Figure S6). They
comprise an FTO transparent electrode, followed by a compact TiO2 acting as hole blocking layer, an electron transport mesoporous
TiO2 layer infiltrated by the perovskite, a hole transport
Spiro-OMeTAD layer (doped with lithium salt (Li-TFSI) and tert-butylpyridine),41 and finally
a gold electrode. In this case, methylammonium lead iodide perovskite
containing a small fraction of chlorine (CH3NH3PbI3–xClx, or MAPI-Cl) was deposited using a single-step procedure following
a reported procedure.42 This reference
perovskite active layer was indeed found to allow a simple fabrication
process in ambient conditions of devices with reasonable efficiencies
due to the beneficial influence of chlorine on both charge diffusion
length43 and layer morphology and structure.44 Further experimental features are detailed in
the Supporting Information.
