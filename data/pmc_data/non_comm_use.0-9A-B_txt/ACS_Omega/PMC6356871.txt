Macrocyclic triamine
disulfonamides can be synthesized by double
Tsuji–Trost N-allylation reaction of open-chain
disulfonamides with 2-alkylidene-1,3-propanediyl bis(carbonates).
The previously used Atkins–Richman macrocyclization method
generally gives lower yields and requires more tedious purification
of the product. Solvent, palladium source, ligand, and concentration
have all been varied to optimize the yields of two key 12-membered
ring bioactive compounds, CADA and VGD020. The new approach tolerates
a wide range of functional groups and gives highest yields for symmetrical
compounds in which the acidities of the two sulfonamide groups are
matched, although the yields of unsymmetrical compounds are still
generally good. The method has also been extended to the synthesis
of 11-membered rings, pyridine-fused macrocycles, and products bearing
an ester or aryl substituent on the exocyclic double bond.

Introduction
Macrocyclic polyamines,
which are of interest for their biological
activity,1 as receptors for anions, or
as ligands for transition metals, can be synthesized by a number of
methods.2 Among the most common is the
Atkins–Richman procedure involving reaction of the dianion
of an open-chain ditosylamide with the disulfonate ester of an open-chain
diol.3,4 This approach has also been modified to
accommodate other dinucleophiles and dielectrophiles, including dihalides.5−8 As shown in Scheme 1 (method A), a modified Atkins–Richman approach was used in
the synthesis of 3-methylene-1,5,9-triazacyclododecane disulfonamides,
which are of interest as potential immunomodulatory and antiviral
drugs.9−13 Many analogs have been synthesized by this method, but it requires
slow addition, large volumes of solvent, and tedious purification
to remove oligomeric byproducts.

(B) Approaches to
3-Methylene-1,5,9-triazacyclododecanes
The exocyclic double bond in the 3-position of the 1,5,9-triazacyclododecane
ring, which is important for activity,9 enables an alternate macrocyclization strategy involving double N-allylation, as shown in Scheme 1 (method B). Tsuji–Trost14−16N-allylation is well-precedented,17−25 and hydroxyl groups in erythromycin A and other macrolide antibiotics
have been bridged with an isobutylene unit by palladium-catalyzed
reaction with 3-methylene-1,3-propanediyl bis(t-butylcarbonate)
in THF or toluene.26−28 In addition, palladium-catalyzed C-allylation with similar dielectrophiles has been used in natural
product total syntheses.29,30

Results and Discussion
The proposed Pd-catalyzed macrocyclization reaction was first tested
on the synthesis of the lead compound, cyclotriazadisulfonamide, CADA
(2), which can be prepared in 54% yield by the Atkins–Richman
method.10 As shown in Table 1, various solvents were tried
and acetonitrile gave the best yield (95%). No oligomeric side products
were detected, and the pure HCl salt was obtained by simply treating
the crude product with methanolic HCl, evaporating, and triturating
the residue with hexane. Three bis(electrophiles) were tested: 1,3-dichloro-2-methylenepropane,
2-methylene-1,3-propanediyl diacetate, and 2-methylene-1,3-propanediyl
bis(t-butylcarbonate). Only the last, a carbonate
ester, gave the desired product.

Macrocyclization results for symmetrical CADA analogs are also
shown in Table 1. Bis(4-methoxybenzenesulfonyl)
analog 4(10) was also obtained
in 95% yield from reaction in acetonitrile and in lower yield from
that in THF. An attempt to prepare 4 from the HCl salt
of the precursor disulfonamide (3) gave no reaction.
Removal of the benzyl tail group also gave nearly quantitative macrocyclization
for 6. This is significant because the Atkins–Richman
approach did not work in attempts to prepare 6, which
was prepared previously by debenzylation of 2. Cyano
groups in 11 did not interfere with the reaction, and
dibrosyl (8)10 and dinosyl
(10)10 analogs were obtained
in similar yields.

Pd-catalyzed macrocyclization was also tested
on synthesis of unsymmetrical
3-methylene-1,5,9-triazacyclododecanes bearing two different arenesulfonyl
side arms (Table 2).
Yields obtained were generally somewhat lower than those for the symmetrical
analogs, probably because of two factors: different acidities of arenesulfonyl
side arms could lead to enhanced formation of oligomeric byproducts
(see below), and these unsymmetrical analogs could not be purified
as solids. The results do show compatibility with additional functional
groups, such as in the chloro (18),11 dimethylamino (26, 28, 44, 46, and 50),10,11 and nitro (36, 38, and 40)11 analogs. In the case of resynthesis
of 4-(dimethylamino)naphthalene-1-sulfonyl (dansyl) analog 28,(10) the disulfonamide precursor (27) was prepared by a more expedient route to unsymmetrical
compounds11 that was developed after the
original synthesis of 28.10

The
expectation that byproducts may be formed when the two arenesulfonamide
groups are different is apparent from the catalytic cycle shown in Figure 1. Electron-donating
or electron-withdrawing substituents on benzenesulfonamides affect
the pKa of the NH group. The catalytic
cycle shows that formation of the π-allyl intermediate generates
an alkoxide, which serves as the base sulfonamide. For an unsymmetrical
open-chain disulfonamide, the more acidic NH should be selectively
allylated. The intermediate must then be deprotonated on the less
acidic NH to undergo macrocyclization by intramolecular N-allylation, so intermolecular reaction with the more acidic NH of
a second open-chain disulfonamide molecule may compete. An oligomer
resulting from this effect is shown later in Scheme 2.

Figure 1 Catalytic cycle for palladium-catalyzed N-allylation
of sulfonamides with allylic carbonates.

Scheme 2 Attempted Macrocyclization of a Hydroxytosylate, Resulting
in Oligomerization
to 52
An attempt was made to extend the scope of this reaction
to macrocycles
containing an ether linkage. The result shown in Scheme 2 was formation of the 2+1 oligomer 52 (VGD043), which was obtained in 27% yield after column
chromatography. Preferential reaction of the sulfonamide nitrogen
relative to the hydroxyl oxygen is consistent with the greater acidity
of benzenesulfonamide relative to methanol (pKa 16.1 vs 29.0, respectively, in DMSO).31 Similar products have been detected spectroscopically as
byproducts from reactions of some unsymmetrical disulfonamides.

Analog 54 (VGD020)11 is
one of the more biologically potent compounds prepared to date, so
attempts were made to improve its synthesis. As shown in Table 3, omission of sodium
carbonate from the reaction mixture gave variable results, so 0.1–1.0
molar equivalents were included in subsequent reactions to insure
complete deprotonation of the tertiary nitrogen. This resulted in
high yields with three different Pd catalysts, Pd2dba3, Pd(OAc)2, and Pd(PPh3)4. As shown in Table 1, when the HCl salt of disulfonamide 3 was used in the
attempted reaction, no product (4) was obtained. Tertiary
amines can become partially protonated and form bicarbonate salts
when exposed to water and atmospheric carbon dioxide. The added Na2CO3 apparently scavenges protons that can quench
the N-allylation reaction by protonating t-butoxide, which is needed for sulfonamide deprotonation
(see catalytic cycle in Figure 1).

With
Pd2dba3 as a source of Pd, reactions
failed when a phosphine ligand was omitted. While reactions worked
with triphenylphosphine and dppf as ligands, somewhat lower yields
were observed. Other sources of Pd such as Pd(PPh3)4 and Pd(OAc)2 can also be used, although Pd2dba3 gave the highest yield. When the bis(electrophile)
2-methylene-1,3-propanediyl bis(t-butylcarbonate)
was replaced with 2-methylene-1,3-propanediyl bis(methylcarbonate),
the reaction succeeded in good yields. This is significant for large-scale
reactions, because the bis(methylcarbonate) reagent is less expensive
to prepare than the diBoc compound. When the concentration of the
reagents and catalyst were decreased from 15 to 20 mM by about half
(9 mM), the yield almost doubled. The last entry in Table 3 shows that greater dilution
did not improve the yield further. Slow addition of mixtures of the
two reactants to hot solvent containing the catalyst was also attempted
but did not improve the yield.

Hydroxyl is considered a difficult
leaving group in Tsuji–Trost
chemistry,15 although allylic alcohols
have been used for N-allylations under certain conditions.32−35 Because of its lower cost and our need to prepare 54 on a larger scale, we also attempted macrocyclization with 2-methylene-1,3-propanediol
under conditions used with dicarbonates, but no product (54) was isolated.

Other variations attempted were to change the
size of the macrocyclic
ring and to fuse a pyridine ring in the position of the tertiary nitrogen
bearing the tail group (Scheme 3). Compound 56 (ES-US5) with an 11-membered macrocyclic
ring was successfully isolated in modest yield (37%), and compound 58 (SH28) consisting of a 12-membered macrocycle fused to
pyridine was prepared in 56% yield. An attempt to carry out an analogous
cyclization to form a 10-membered ring failed, but after adjusting
the reaction conditions, the 20-membered 2+2 macrocycle 60 (LAL012) was isolated in 50% yield.

Scheme 3 Ring Size and Pyridine
Ring Fusion Variations
Further experiments were conducted to determine if substituents
on the isobutylene head group could be tolerated (Scheme 4). Use of diBoc reagents with
an ester or a phenyl substituent gave the macrocyclic products in
modest yield. Ester 62 (RA014) was isolated as a 1:1
mixture of E/Z stereoisomers that
could not be separated by chromatography, but recrystallization gave
a crystalline 1.4:1 mixture that yielded to full characterization,
including combustion microanalysis. Attempts to prepare an analog
with two methyl substituents on the exocyclic double bond failed to
give the 12-membered macrocycle. Chromatography of the reaction mixture
gave bis(diene) 64 (TL002) instead. This side product
was initially identified by mass spectrometry, then the diBoc reagent
was used in larger excess, and 64 was isolated in 88%
yield. The formation of this open-chain bis(diene) can be attributed
to steric hindrance of macrocyclization and base-mediated E2′
elimination of the allylic BocO– group of the monoallylated
intermediate (cf. Figure 1). The successful macrocyclization of 1 with
the phenyl-substituted di(Boc) reagent 65 to form 66 with an exocylic benzylidine substituent in the head group
is also shown in Scheme 4.

Scheme 4 Head Group Variations
Conclusions
We conclude that Pd-catalyzed reaction
of disulfonamides with doubly
allylic bis(carbonates) is a versatile approach to useful macrocyclic
polyamines that give good yields, when compared with other macrocyclization
methods. The reaction tolerates a wide range of substituents and can
be used to prepare 11-membered rings and pyridine-fused analogs, as
well as macrocyclic triamines with monosubstituted isobutylene head
groups.

Experimental Section
General Methods
All reactions were
performed under
anhydrous nitrogen. Solvents and reagents obtained from Sigma-Aldrich
Chemical Company or Fisher Scientific were of ACS reagent grade or
better. They were used without purification, unless stated otherwise.
HCl (2 N) solutions in methanol/water were made from 42 mL of concentrated
aq. HCl (12.1 N) and 210 mL of methanolic HCl salts were triturated
by sonication in anhydrous diethyl ether (5–15 mL, unless stated
otherwise) for 5 min and filtration, repeating the process at least
twice. “Overnight” periods are approximately 16 h. Organic
solutions were dried over anhydrous Na2SO4 and
then filtered. Drying in vacuo was done at 0.1 mm and at room temperature,
unless stated otherwise. Column chromatography employed Sorbent Technologies
neutral alumina (50–200 μm) or standard grade silica
(32–63 μm), unless stated otherwise. Melting points were
measured with Thomas-Hoover or Mel-Temp apparatus and are uncorrected. 1H NMR (400 or 500 MHz) and 13C NMR (100 or 125
MHz) spectra were acquired on Varian 400 or Varian Unity+ 500 spectrometers.
Chemical shifts (δ) are reported in ppm values relative to solvent
peaks as follows: 1H, CDCl3/TMS = 0.00, DMSO-d6 = 2.50, CD3OD = 3.31; 13C, CDCl3 = 77.23, DMSO-d6 =
39.7, CD3OD = 49.15 ppm. Infrared spectra (IR) were acquired
on a Nicolet 6700 FTIR spectrometer. Low-resolution mass spectra (MS)
were recorded on a Waters Micromass ZQ electrospray ionization quadrupole
mass spectrometer employing positive-ion detection (cap. voltage =
3.5 kV). High-resolution mass spectra (HRMS) were obtained on an Agilent
6230 TOF mass spectrometer. Combustion analysis samples were dried
at 78 °C (0.1 mm, 2 d), unless noted otherwise, and microanalysis
was done by NuMega Resonance Labs, Inc. After purification, all products
were at least 95% pure, as proven by C,H,N microanalysis or NMR spectroscopy.

General Procedure for Tsuji–Trost Macrocyclization Synthesis
of 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 28
All glassware and equipment
used in macrocyclization reactions, including stir bars, spatulas,
syringes, and needles, were dried overnight at 110 °C. Anhydrous
acetonitrile (AN) used in macrocyclizations was dried by distillation
from CaH2. All reagents were dried at 0.1 mm overnight
before use.

In a 250 mL flask equipped with an inlet for N2 and a stirring bar, a mixture of 1.9 mmol of the disulfonamide,
4.7 mmol of the bis(electrophile), 0.06 mmol of tris(dibenzylideneacetone)dipalladium(0)
(Pd2(dba)3), 0.11 mmol of 1,1-bis(diphenylphosphino)butane
(dppb), and 120 mL of anhydrous AN was stirred and boiled under reflux
for 18–24 h under N2. The solvent was removed by
rotary evaporation. A solution of the residue in 90 mL of dichloromethane
(DCM) was extracted with saturated aq. NaHCO3 solution
(2 × 30 mL) and saturated aq. NaCl solution (30 mL), dried (Na2SO4), filtered, and evaporated to dryness. A solution
of the crude product in 10 mL of 2 N HCl in methanol/water was stirred
for a few hours, and then, the solvent was removed by rotary evaporation.
The residue was dried in vacuo (0.1 mm), triturated with diethyl ether
(5 × 15 mL) and then again dried in vacuo.

Resynthesis of 2 (CADA·HCl)10
Using the

the free base by stirring for several hours with 40 mL of DCM, 40
mL of saturated aq. NaCl solution, and 50 mL of 2 N aq. KOH solution.
The layers were separated, and the aqueous layer was extracted with
DCM (2 × 25 mL). The combined aqueous solutions were dried (Na2SO4), filtered, and evaporated to dryness. The
residue was purified by column chromatography on alumina, eluting
with hexane/ethyl acetate (3:1, v/v).

Using the general
macrocyclization procedure, except for
dilution of all reagents and catalysts to a concentration of 9 mM
for the disulfonamide, 0.80 g (1.35 mmol) of 9, which
was prepared as described previously,10 was converted to 0.49 g (56%) of pure 9-benzyl-3-methylene-1,5-di(p-nitrobenzenesulfonyl-1,5,9-triazacyclododecane 10 (AS114). The free base was generated from the HCl salt and purified
as described for 8.

11 mL of DCM, 11 mL of saturated aq. Na2CO3 solution,
and 11 mL of saturated aq. NaCl solution was stirred vigorously at
room temperature for 24 h. The layers were separated, and the aqueous
layer was extracted with DCM (2 × 10 mL). The combined organic
solutions were dried (Na2SO4) and concentrated
to dryness by rotary evaporation. The residue was dried in vacuo and
purified by column chromatography on alumina, eluting with hexane/EtOAc
