This work describes
a practical methodology for C–C bond
formation reactions with the aid of biogenic palladium nanoparticles,
which are synthesized by using phytochemicals extracted from two common
plant species. Comparative studies have been done on the activity
of two plant species (Ocimum sanctum and Aloe vera) in generation of palladium
nanoparticles via ex situ and in situ methods. The structural and
morphological characteristics of the nanoparticles are examined by
UV/visible spectroscopy, powder X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and transmission
electron microscopy analyses. We have observed a significant influence
of the substrates on the catalytic activity of the palladium nanoparticles
in Sonogashira and Suzuki cross-coupling reactions.

1 Introduction
In recent years, metal nanoparticles (NPs) have been widely applied
in different areas ranging from catalysis to biomedical diagnostics
on account of their unique size, shape, and composition. These materials
are susceptible to various chemical and physical modifications and
can conjugate with varying antibodies, ligands, and drugs providing
a wide range of applications.1−4 Various chemical, biological, and physical methods
have been explored for synthesis of metal NPs.5,6 The
characteristic feature in the synthesis of NPs is that the nanosystems
should be stable, biocompatible, and selective in their action. Catalytic
activity of metal NPs finds wide application in organic synthesis
and the “NP-catalyzed organic synthesis enhancement”
(NOSE) approach is considered as an effective route for organic synthesis.7,8 The catalytic activity of metal NPs is specifically related to their
size and distribution. However, smaller NPs in some cases agglomerate
to minimize their surface area due to their excess surface free energy,
resulting in a remarkable decrease in their catalytic activities.
As such there requires additional stabilizers or supports for the
enhanced catalytic activity of the metal NPs. In situ-generated NPs
(NPsin situ) on account of their one-pot condition
does not demand additional stabilizers because it remains under the
influence of the reactant species. Another advantage of NPsin situ is that it avoids the laborious preparative and isolation processes.

Considering the positive aspects of NPsin situ,
researchers now tend to utilize transition-metal NPsin situ in different fields of catalysis and organic synthesis. Various
approaches for generation of in situ NPs of Au, Ag, Cu, and Pd have
been reported.9−14 Chemical methods for generation of NPs are associated with toxic
byproducts and uneconomical issues. From the green chemistry point
of view, environmentally benevolent alternative reducing agents for
the synthesis of NPs are in great demand. In this regard, the introduction
of microorganisms and plant resources provides an environmentally
benign and a cost-effective alternative route for the synthesis of
metal NPs.15−17 There are various methodologies in which the specific
pure compound of plant origin is used in NP preparation, for example,
ascorbic acid and gallic acid which are plant polyphenols and act
as great stabilizing agents in synthesis of NPs.18−20 Plant extracts
possess various biologically active phytochemicals (e.g., alkaloids,
terpenoids, and polyphenolic compounds) which themselves serve as
a reducing/stabilizing agent for bulk transition metals to nanodimensional
particles.21 The plant-based approaches
of synthesis of metal NPs not only provides a faster rate of reduction
of metal ions to zero valent metal but nucleate/cap them into stable
and controlled morphology. As such biogenic reduction of metal ions
in the absence of chemical reagents is an interesting approach on
account of the environmental sustainability.

The C–C
framework in organic synthesis is an indispensable
tool for synthesis of numerous structural functionalities which are
indeed building blocks of natural products, agrochemicals, medicinally
important compounds, and so forth. The simplest and of course the
most imperative synthetic transformations are based on Csp2–Csp2 and Csp2–Csp bonds commonly
known as Suzuki and Sonogashira cross-coupling reactions, respectively.
These transformations turn up as a pioneer for synthesis of various
biologically active compounds and construction of pharmaceuticals,
fine chemicals, and smart engineering materials, including conducting
polymers and molecular wires.22−26 Of all transition metals, Pd contributes an impressive ability to
construct C–C bonds between diversely functionalized substrates.27 Very recently, we have reported the synthesis
of Pd NPs using papaya peel extract and subsequently evaluated the
catalytic efficiencies toward Suzuki and Sonogashira cross-coupling
reactions.28 Motivated by the remarkable
results, we herein explore the tandem synthesis of
Pd NPs and C–C cross-coupling reaction in a one-pot reaction
process using two different plant extracts [Ocimum
sanctum(OS) and Aloe vera(AV)]. Interestingly, we found a significant difference in the catalytic
behavior of the two Pd NPs (PdAV NPs and PdOS NPs). PdAV NPs were found to be more effective for Suzuki
coupling reaction, whereas PdOS NPs were more proficient
for Sonogashira coupling reaction.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Characterization of Pd
NPs
The Pd
NPs were characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM),
powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), UV/visible spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS), and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR)
spectroscopy and investigated the catalytic activity in C–C
coupling reactions and annulation via C–X functionalization.

During the preparation of Pd NPs, it was noticed that both the
extract and the Pd(OAc)2 mixture undergoes reduction of
Pd(II) to Pd(0) in different time intervals (Figure 1).

Figure 1 Change in color of Pd(OAc)2 at different
time intervals
after addition of (a) Ext OS and (b) Ext AV.

The mixture of OS leaf extract (Ext OS) and Pd(OAc)2 shows a gradual change in color from light brown to black after
1 h (Figure 1a). The
change in color of Pd(OAc)2 on addition of AV extract (Ext
AV) was observed after 5 h (Figure 1b). This variation of reducing potential of the extracts
with time may be due to the presence of different concentrations of
phytochemicals present in the two plant species.

It was found
from the existing literature that various quantitative
analyses have been carried out to reveal the chemical compositions
of OS and AV. From the comparative study of both the plant species,
it was found that OS leaves possess a greater amount of reducing sugar
and ascorbic acid, although different amounts were reported by Hassan
et al. and Kashif et al. (Table 1).29−32 It is seen in various literature reports that ascorbic acid and
different reducing sugars are used in generation of NPs.33−35 As such these phytochemicals in the respective plant species helps
in the reduction of the Pd(II) ion. However, the presence of a greater
amount of these chemical constituents in OS as compared to AV reveals
its greater reducing potential. Additionally, other phytochemicals
such as flavanoids, essential oils, and phenolic contents are also
present which may also assist in the reduction/stabilization of metal
NPs.36−41

Initially, we have
performed powder XRD to understand the formation
of the Pd NPs using both plant extracts. Figure 2a shows the powder XRD pattern of the PdOS NP, which matches well with standard JCPDS card no. 89-4897.
The diffraction peaks at a 2θ value of 40.5°, 46.3°,
and 67.8° corresponding to crystallographic planes (111), (200),
and (220), respectively, suggest the formation of the face-centered
cubic (fcc) lattice system of PdOS NPs. Again, Figure 2b shows the powder
XRD pattern of PdAV NPs, which shows the formation of the
fcc lattice system (JCPDS card no. 89-4897) with an additional tetragonal
system for the PdO nanostructure (JCPDS card no. 75-0200). The observed
peaks at a 2θ value of 39.9°, 46.1°, and 68.3°
correspond to planes (111), (200), and (220), respectively, with two
additional diffraction peaks of PdO at a 2θ value of 18.1 and
30.6 for (001) and (100) reflections, respectively. The formation
of Pd/PdO in the case of PdAV NPs may be due to longer
time requirement for reduction of Pd(II) which as a result leads to
aerial oxidation of Pd(0).

and (b) PdAV NPs.

Further, we have characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS) analysis in order to confirm the oxidation state of Pd NPs in
PdOS NPs and PdAV NPs. Figure 3a shows the survey scan spectrum of PdOS NPs, indicating the presence of Pd. The high-resolution
peak fitting spectrum of PdOS NPs comprises two peaks at
335.05 and 340.20 eV attributed to the Pd 3d5/2 and Pd
3d3/2 spin-orbit peaks of Pd(0) as shown in Figure 3b. From the XPS analysis of
PdOS NPs, it is evident that Pd NPs present in the zero
(0) oxidation state.

Pd 3d spectrum of PdOS NPs, (c) XPS survey spectrum of
PdAV NPs, (d) high-resolution Pd 3d spectrum of PdAV NPs, and (e) high-resolution O 1s spectrum of PdAV NPs.

On the other hand, the survey
scan XPS of PdAV NPs signifies
the occurrence of Pd and O as shown in Figure 3c. The high-resolution peak fitting Pd 3d
spectrum for PdAV NPs reveals the presence of four peaks
at 334.66, 337, 338.93, and 342.30 eV, which belongs to Pd(0), Pd(II),
Pd(0), and Pd(II), respectively (Figure 3d). Therefore, the formation of Pd/PdO NPs
is confirmed from the high-resolution XPS spectrum. Further, the high-resolution
O 1s spectrum as shown in Figure 3e also confirmed the presence of PdO in PdAV NPs.

FTIR of the PdOS NPs and PdAV NPs
was recorded
by comparing with the precursor Pd(OAc)2 as shown in Figure 4. The shifting/disappearance
of characteristic peaks of Pd(OAc)2 reveals the formation
of metallic Pd(0) particles. Figure 4a shows the vibrational peaks at 1604 and 1332 cm–1, which is due to the respective asymmetric and symmetric
stretching of C=O.42 The sharp peak
at 1408 cm–1 is due to the ionized carboxylate group.
The shifting of these vibrational modes after the addition of Ext
OS and Ext AV to Pd(OAc)2 confirms the reduction of the
Pd(II) ion (Figure 4b). Additionally, the disappearance of peak at 691 cm–1 due to Pd–O further validates the formation of the Pd(0)
nanostructure using Ext OS.43 Further,
the peak in region 781 and 597 cm–1 signifies the
presence of PdO along with Pd(0) particles.

and (c) PdAV NPs.

Next, the potential of Ext OS and Ext AV was examined in
case of
in situ generation of NPs considering C–C cross-coupling as
the model reaction. The formation of Pd NPs was further confirmed
by the UV/visible spectroscopic experiment and TEM analyses.

Figure 5a–c
shows the UV/visible absorption spectra of the in situ-generated colloidal
suspension of PdOS NPs. A weak band at 279 nm was observed
in Figure 5a, which
corresponds to Ext OS.44,45 After the addition of Pd(OAc)2, an additional peak centered near 400 nm was observed which
is a characteristic of the Pd(II) ion Figure 5b.46 Subsequent
bioreduction of the precursor Pd(OAc)2 solution results
in the disappearance of the corresponding peak at 400 nm (Figure 5c), indicating the
complete reduction of the Pd(II) salts to nanosized Pd(0). Figure 5d shows a distinctive
UV absorption peak at 260 nm due to Pd(OAc)2 and Ext AV
solutions. On addition of subsequent reactants of C–C coupling,
the peak at 260 nm disappeared which signifies the complete reduction
of Pd(II) (Figure 5e). However, a very broad UV absorption peak centered near 260 nm
was observed for pre-prepared PdAV NPs (Figure 5f) which shows that the Pd(II)
ion in this condition does not undergo complete reduction to Pd(0)
even after prolonged stirring.

Pd(OAc)2 and Ext
OS, (c) PdOS NPsin situ, (d) Pd(OAc)2 and Ext AV, (e) PdAV NPsin situ, and (f) PdAV NPsex situ.

The morphology of the in situ-generated PdOS NPs was
studied by TEM analysis. It can be seen from the high-resolution TEM
(HRTEM) image Figure 6a,c, and the interplaner distance of 0.22 and 0.19 nm corresponds
to lattice planes (111) and (200), respectively. The TEM images also
clearly reflect crystalline fringes with four well-resolved rings
as indexed in the selected area electron diffraction pattern of the
Pd NP inset in Figure 6c. The crystal lattice plane as depicted in the inset, namely, (111),
(200), (220), and (222) agrees well with the XRD database for corresponding hkl planes which suggests the fcc crystal structure of the
Pd NPs. Additionally, it is observed that the PdOS NPs
are well dispersed and are spherical in shape (Figure 6b). The distribution of the in situ-generated
PdOS NPs was analyzed using Gaussian fits (Figure 6d) and the resultant data were
plotted in a histogram showing a majority of particles being in the
range of 4–5 nm, with a mean diameter of about 4.41 nm.

Again, the in situ-generated PdAV NPs show well-dispersed
spherical NPs between 4 and 5 nm with an interplaner distance of 0.22,
0.19, and 0.29 nm, which corresponds to lattice planes (111) and (200)
for Pd NPs and (100) for PdO, respectively, as presented in Figure 7a–c. The selected
area electron diffraction pattern of PdAV NPsin situ shows polycrystalline fringes with four well-resolved rings corresponding
to crystal lattice planes, namely, (111), (200), (220), and (311),
which agrees well with the XRD database for the fcc crystal structure
of the Pd NPs as shown in Figure 7d.

SAED pattern
of PdAV NPsin situ.

2.2 Catalytic Activity of Pd NPs
The
catalytic activities of both PdAV and PdOS NPs
were investigated for the Suzuki–Miyaura cross-coupling reaction.
Initially, the catalytic activity was examined for the pre-prepared
Pd NPs using 4-bromonitrobenzene and phenylboronic acid as the model
substrate. The reaction affords only 30 and 10% of isolated yields
of the cross-coupling product with both ex situ-generated PdAV and PdOS NPs. In the case of PdOS NPs, a significant
amount of the homocoupling product of arylboronic acid was observed
(Table 2, entries 1
& 2). We next opt to study the in situ catalytic effects of the
aqueous plant extracts on the reaction progress. On using Ext AV,
we were able to isolate 50% of the desired product using 1 mol % Pd(OAc)2 in biphasic solvent medium (Table 2, entry 3). On increasing the amount of Ext
AV, a gradual increase in reaction yield was observed (Table 2, entries 4 & 5). Enhanced
catalytic activity was observed using 2 mL of Ext AV (Table 2, entry 5). However, on performing
the reaction using Ext OS, relatively lower yield of the cross-coupling
product was obtained (Table 2, entries 6 & 7). Because the phytochemical constituents
in both the plant extracts (Ext OS & Ext AV) vary in nature and
composition (Table 1),29−32 the catalytic efficiency in the coupling reaction seems to differ.
Interestingly, during the synthesis of Pd NPs using both the plant
extracts, we have observed that Ext OS was more effective than Ext
AV, and Pdos NPsex situ is formed quickly
compared to PdAV NPsex situ (Figure 1). On the contrary, during
the in situ experiments, Ext OS was found to be less effective compared
to Ext AV in Suzuki reaction. The cause of poorer conversion in case
of Ext OS might be due to the presence of arylboronic acid. Liu et
al. in 2008 described the role of arylboronic acid in the formation
of NPs.47 They had performed a controlled
experiment for in situ generation of NPs, and established that arylboronic
acid acts as an associate reducing agent in the formation of NPs.
A similar case was observed in the present protocol in the generation
of in situ PdAV NPs. As we have seen that in the synthesis
of PdAV NPsex situ, it requires a longer
time for the conversion of Pd(II) to Pd(0) nano without any chemical
reducing agent. However, in the in situ catalytic approaches, after
addition of arylboronic acid, the Pd(II) ions immediately changes
to black color indicating the quickened formation of Pd NPs. UV/vis
spectra have also revealed the difference in reduction of the Pd(II)
ion. Moreover, arylboronic acids act as a stabilizer for NPs and serve
as a capping agent to keep them constant in size. This may sometimes
lead to limitation of catalytic activity of NPs,48 which was observed in the case of PdOS NPsin situ. Because the Ext OS act a great reducing stabilizer
in the generation of NPs, the additional stabilizing effect of arylboronic
acid capped most of the free surface active site for catalysis resulting
in the weaker catalytic activity of PdOS NPin situ. As such according to the adsorption theory, activation of 4-bromonitrobenzene
was diminished because of adsorption/capping of arylboronic acid particulates
in the catalyst surface, resulting in poor reaction yield. Again,
it is seen that in the absence of either of the extracts, the reaction
does not proceed efficiently, which reveal the significance of the
plant extract in the reaction medium (Table 2, entry 8). Considering the higher activity
of PdAV NPsin situ in this Suzuki–Miyaura
coupling, further optimization was carried out using Ext AV. The catalytic
activity of PdAV NPsin situ was examined
by lowering the amount of Pd(OAc)2. However, a significant
decrease in reaction yield was observed (Table 2, entry 9). The catalytic efficiency was
checked using water as the reaction medium. However, no appreciable
result was obtained (Table 2, entry 10). This may be due to insolubility of the reactant
species in water resulting in weaker coordination with the catalyst.
Next, we have performed the reaction considering 4-bromoanisole and
phenylboronic acid as the coupling partners. In this case, the reaction
seems to proceed efficiently in water as the reaction medium along
with lower catalyst loading (Table 2, entries 11 & 12). This is evidence of the solubility
and coordination issue of the reactant species with the reaction medium
and the catalyst. Then, the effect of different bases such as NaOH,
Na2CO3, and Na2PO4 has
been studied, but superior catalytic activity was achieved only with
K2CO3 (Table 2, entries 13–15 vs 12).

The catalytic system was studied
for electronically diverse arylbromides
and arylboronic acid. The reaction efficiency for both the methods
using Ext OS and Ext AV was shown in Table 3. As already discussed, method A (with Ext
OS) does not show diverse substrate compatibility. Method B (Ext AV)
delivers an excellent yield of the cross-coupling product with an
electron donating substituent with lower catalyst loading in pure
water as solvent (Table 3, 3a, 3e, 3k–o). The aryl halide-bearing hydroxyl group, on
the other hand, demands greater catalyst loading with EtOH as cosolvent.
The reaction was also compatible for electron withdrawing substituents
affording excellent conversion in biphasic medium. However, a slightly
greater amount of the catalyst was required in comparison to electron-donating
arylbromides (Table 3, 3b–d, 3g–i). From Table 3, it is observed that electronically varied
arylboronic acid does not affect the reaction yield. The t-Bu substituent on phenylboronic acid requires a biphasic condition
for effective coupling. This may be due to a solubility issue of the
substrate in water (Table 3, 3j). The effectiveness of method B was examined for heteroaryl
halide, and moderate yield of the cross-coupling product was achieved
although greater reaction time was required (Table 3, 3p).

Because the recyclability of the
catalyst is one of the most important
factors in a reaction protocol, we have investigated the recyclability
of the catalytic species using 4-bromoanisole and phenylboronic acid
as the coupling partners. After the first catalytic cycle, the reaction
mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate followed by centrifugation.
The clearly separated organic fraction was removed and evaporated
to get the crude product and purified to obtain 92% isolated yield.
The residue catalyst was washed with ethanol and then directly reused
for the next catalytic run with the addition of fresh reactants, base,
and solvent. The reaction affords similar reactivity till the third
cycle (Figure 8). However,
a slight decrease in catalytic activity was observed with 80% yield
in the fourth cycle with a slight longer reaction time.

Figure 8 Reusability
of PdAV NPsin situ in Suzuki–Miyaura
Coupling.

The morphology of PdAV NPsin situ after
the second catalytic cycle was studied by TEM and HRTEM analysis (Figure
S57, Supporting Information). The TEM and
HRTEM images show spherical NPs of Pd/PdO for PdAV NPsin situ. Most of the Pd/PdO NPs were agglomerated during
the reaction course. Therefore, the size of the NPs after the second
catalytic cycle is not clearly determinable. However, the lattice
fringes are visible in the HRTEM image (Figure S57d). The lattice fringe distance was found to be 0.22 nm
corresponding to the Pd(111) crystallographic plane.

Next, we
have studied the catalytic activity of the ex situ- and
in situ-generated Pd NPs in Sonogashira cross-coupling of arylhalides
and terminal alkynes. Considering our previous work on Sonogashira
coupling,49 we have performed the reaction
using 4-iodonitrobenzene and phenylacetylene as our screening substrates
in EtOH and K2CO3 as a base at 40 °C. The
results are summarized in Table 4.

Initially, we
have studied the catalytic activity of both Pd NPsex situ for Sonogashira coupling. We have noticed a significant
difference in reactivity in comparison to the Suzuki–Miyaura
cross-coupling reaction. Superior catalytic activity was observed
using PdOS NPs with 95% of the cross-coupling product (Table 4, entry 1). A comparatively
lower conversion was observed for PdAV NPs with extended
reaction time (Table 4, entry 2). Similar observation was achieved in the case of the in
situ approach with Ext OS (PdOS NPin situ) being more competent than Ext AV (PdAVNPin situ) (Table 4, entries
3 & 4). Moreover, PdOS NPin situ affords
greater yield within shorter reaction time, which may be due to the
greater reducing and stabilizing effect of the extract in the reaction
medium (Table 4, entry
1 vs entry 3). Considering the enhanced catalytic activity of PdOS NPin situ, further screening of the reaction
was performed using these conditions. At room temperature, the reaction
delivers a lower yield of the cross-coupled product (Table 4, entry 5). On increasing the
amount of Ext OS, the yield of the product slightly decreases (Table 4, entry 6). The difference
in reaction yield on varying the amount of extract (Table 4 entries 3 vs 6) may be due
to greater capping of free Pd surface sites by the plant extract,
which as a result lowers the accessibility of the Pd NP particle at
the surface for catalysis.50,51 Moreover, in the absence
of Ext OS, the reaction bears very minimum conversion, which signifies
their role and importance for the present cross-coupling reaction
(Table 4, entry 7).
On lowering the amount of Pd(OAc)2, the reaction efficiency
decreases(Table 4,
entry 8). Next, we have screened the Sonogashira cross-coupling for
different bases. The activity of various inorganic bases such as Cs2CO3, Na2CO3, NaHCO3, NaOAc, and NaOH was studied (Table 4, entries 9–13). However, greater efficiency
was achieved only in the case of K2CO3 and Cs2CO3 (Table 4, entries 3 & 9). However considering the cost and hygroscopic
nature of Cs2CO3, we opt for the readily available
and low-cost K2CO3 for our reaction protocol.
Again, the efficiency of the catalyst was checked using varying solvent
systems. Use of pure water or biphasic medium such as EtOH–H2O (1:1) significantly decreases the yield of the product (Table 4, entries 14 &
15). Other solvents such as 2-MeTHF, 2-MeTHF/H2O (1:1),
and tetrahydrofuran (THF) do not meet to our expectation in terms
of isolated yield (Table 4, entries 16–18). Later, considering the optimized
reaction condition, the coupling reaction was also tested for different
palladium sources such as PdCl2. But, lower conversion
of the desired product was noticed (Table 4, entry 19). This lower activity of PdCl2 in the present reaction system may be due to difference in
coordination of the anion (Cl– < OAc–) to the NP surface. Thus, lower efficacy of the Cl– anion toward stabilization of the nanostructure may hamper the catalytic
performance.52,53 We have carried out our reaction
using 1:1 ratio of the substrates (Table 4, entry 20). However, a significant decrease
in reaction efficiency was observed.

Electronically different
substrates were examined to verify the
catalytic activity of method A and method B for Sonogashira coupling
(Table 5). Method B,
as already discussed provides lower efficiency in terms of yield and
time (Table 5, 6a,
b & c). Method A provides efficient cross-coupling for diverse
range of substrates (Table 5, 6d–6u). It is compatible for aliphatic alkynes which
in general is low reactive in nature (Table 5, 6q–6u).54,55 Aryl iodides-bearing electron withdrawing groups in p- and m-positions
proceed to completion of reaction with excellent yield of the cross-coupling
product (Table 5, 6d,
6f, 6g, 6l–p). However, electron-donating aryl iodides are
less competent in comparison to the later (Table 5, entry 6h & 6i). The variation in reaction
efficiency may be due to the electronic effect of the substituents.
Because the presence of the electron-donating group increases, the
electron density over sp2 carbon and halide bond causes
difficulty in C–X bond breaking for the oxidative addition
step.56,57 Again, the steric effect as in case of 2-iodonitrobenzene
results in low yield of the product (Table 5, 6j). Next, the effect of different aromatic
and aliphatic alkynes was investigated. The catalytic system delivers
similar conversion in the case of different substituted aromatic alkynes
(Table 5, 6k–6p).
A slightly longer reaction time is required for aliphatic alkynes;
nevertheless, in all cases, modest to good yield of the desired product
was achieved (Table 5, 6q–6u). However, a difference in reactivity of 1-hexyne
was observed with 4-iodonitrobenzene and 4-iodotoluene (Table 5, 6t and 6u). Iodobenzene in
all cases offers comparable catalytic performance in terms of both
reaction yield and time (Table 5, 6e, 6k, and 6q–6s). Next, we have tried to extend
our catalytic system for arylbromides. Because C–Br activation
is difficult in comparison to C–I, coupling of substituted
arylbromides was found to be difficult. Only 50–65% of isolated
yield was achieved for p-NO2 and p-CH3 substituents
of arylbromide (Table 5, 6d and6h). Bromobenzene, on the other hand, delivers a good yield
of the desired cross-coupled product within shorter reaction time
(Table 5, 6e). However,
the reaction did not proceed with aryl chlorides. Moreover, we have
tried to investigate the catalytic activity of the present protocol
in the synthesis of indole derivatives via intermolecular cyclization
of 2-iodoaniline and arylalkynes. The catalytic activity of both the
ex situ- and in situ-generated Pd NPs was examined. The results are
shown in Table 6. However,
the yield of the desired product was not satisfactory. A comparatively
better activity was observed in the case of PdAV NPsex situ, which may be attributed to the presence of PdO,
thereby favoring the interaction between the amine lone pair and the
Pd(II) center.58

c Sonogashira cross-coupling yield.

As an additional assessment, to
identify the catalytic nature of
both the Pd NPs (PdAV NPsin situ and PdOS NPsin situ), in the reaction medium, we
have performed the hot filtration test for both the cross-coupling
reactions.59 Leaching of Pd particles was
not observed because the reaction did not proceed further after the
filtration of the catalytic species from the reaction mixture. Hence,
the in situ-generated Pd NPs are heterogeneous in nature. As per the
recyclability of PdOS NPsin situ in Sonogashira
coupling reaction, the catalyst could not be recovered after the workup,
which may be due to smaller particle sizes of PdOS NPsin situ. However, in Suzuki coupling, boronic acid stabilized
and capped the Pd NPs and as such prevents the Pd NPs to dissociate
into smaller aggregates.

3 Conclusions
The
present system highlights the different reducing characteristics
of two naturally abundant herbs found over worldwide. This protocol
provides a platform for the study of different catalytic influences
of Pd NPs in C–C cross-coupling reactions with a wide range
of substrate scope under mild reaction conditions. The significant
influence of the substrates on the catalytic activity of the biogenic
palladium NPs has been observed in Sonogashira and Suzuki cross-coupling
reactions. Moreover, the present work focuses on one-pot biogenic
generation of Pd NPs under aerobic conditions without the use of any
additional chemical reducing agent. The process appears as an excellent
alternative for many ligand-assisted systems for C–C coupling
and elegantly follows the green chemistry principles of a safer reaction
strategy.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 General
Information and Characterization Techniques
In this work,
the chemicals were used without further drying or
purification. Plant species were collected from the Tezpur University
Campus, India. The UV/visible spectra were recorded in a UV/visible
spectrophotometer (Shimadzu Corporation, UV-2550). Infrared spectra
were recorded using an FTIR spectrophotometer (PerkinElmer Frontier
MIR FIR). Measurements are performed by pelletizing the samples with
KBr in the midinfrared region. The X-ray diffraction study of the
samples was carried out in a Rigaku MultiFlex instrument using a nickel-filtered
Cu Kα (0.15418 nm) as the radiation source. The morphology and
particle size distribution were studied by TEM analysis with JEOL
JEM 2100 (200 kV). 1H and 13C spectra were recorded
in CDCl3 using tetramethylsilane as an internal standard
on a JEOL, JNM ECS NMR spectrometer operating at 400 MHz. X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were performed by the ESCALAB Xi+ spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific Pvt. Ltd. UK) having
a monochromatic Al Kα X-ray source (1486.6 eV).

4.2 Isolation of Plant Extracts
4.2.1 Preparation
of Ext OS
Fresh leaves
of OS (1 g) were collected and washed thoroughly with distilled water
and grounded in a mortar. The pastes so obtained were boiled in 10
mL distilled water for 5 min. The mixture was then centrifuged, and
the filtrate was collected for further use.60

4.2.2 Preparation of Ext AV
Healthy leaves
of AV (10 g) were collected and washed thoroughly with distilled water.
The leaves were squeezed to extract the gel and collected in a beaker.
The mixture was sonicated for 30 min to obtain the uniform gel type
extract and then stored in the refrigerator for further use.60

4.3 General Method of Preparation
of Pd NPs by
Ex Situ Method
In a 10 mL round-bottom flask, 2 mL 0.05 N
alcoholic Pd(OAc)2 [0.01 g of Pd(OAc)2] was
stirred with 4 mL of the aqueous extract at room temperature. The
mixture of Pd(OAc)2 and Ext OS show a gradual change in
color from brown to dark brown within 15 min and to complete black
after 1 h, indicating the reduction of the Pd(II) ion (Figure 1a). However, the mixture of
Pd(OAc)2 and Ext AV shows a gradual change in color from
brown to dark brown in 5 h and subsequently to black after 12 h (Figure 1b). The resulting
Pd NPs were separated through centrifugation, and the pastes were
dried under vacuum for further analysis.

4.4 General
Information about Catalytic Experiments
Cross-coupling and
annulation reactions were carried out under
aerobic conditions. The progress of the reactions was monitored by
aluminum-coated TLC plates (Merck silica gel 60F254) and visualized
under a UV lamp. The desired products were purified and isolated by
the column chromatographic technique using a silica gel (60–120
mesh) and n-hexane. The desired isolated products
were identified by comparing their 1H and 13C NMR spectra as presented in the Supporting Information.

4.5 Experimental Procedure
for the Catalytic Reactions
4.5.1 Typical Procedure for
in Situ-Catalyzed
Suzuki–Miyaura Reaction
A mixture of aryl halide (0.5
mmol), arylboronic acid (0.6 mmol), K2CO3 (1.5
mmol), Pd(OAc)2 (1 mol %), required amount of extract,
and (1:1) EtOH/H2O was taken in a 25 mL round-bottom flask.
The reactants were allowed to stir at room temperature. After completion
(vide TLC), the catalyst was separated from the reaction mixture by
centrifugation, and the crude reaction mixture was extracted with
ethyl acetate (3 × 10 mL). The resultant organic fraction was
separated and washed with brine (2 × 10 mL) and dried over anhydrous
Na2SO4 and evaporated under reduced pressure.
The desired product was isolated by column chromatography using ethyl
acetate and hexane as an eluant and purity was confirmed by 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy analyses.

4.5.2 Typical Procedure for in Situ-Catalyzed
Sonogashira Coupling Reaction
In a 50 mL round-bottom flask,
1 mol % (0.001 g) Pd(OAc)2 and the required amount of extract
was mixed. To the resulting mixture, 0.5 mmol (1 equiv) aryl halide
and 0.6 mmol (1.2 equiv) terminal alkyne were added followed by addition
of 4 mL EtOH and K2CO3 (1.5 mmol). The mixture
was then stirred at 40 °C, and the progress of the reaction was
monitored by TLC. After completion, the reaction mixture was diluted
with H2O and extracted with ethyl acetate (3 × 10
mL), dried over Na2SO4, and concentrated in
vacuum. The residue was purified by column chromatography on silica
gel using hexane as an eluent to obtain the pure product (functionalized
alkyne). Purity of isolated products was confirmed by 1H and 13C NMR spectra.

4.5.3 Catalytic
Procedure Using Pd NPsex situ Prepared from Respective
Ext OS (PdOS NP) and Ext AV
(PdAV NP)
Pd NPs (1 mol %) were mixed with 0.5
mmol aryl halide, 0.6 mmol of arylboronic acid, and phenylacetylene
with 1.5 mmol K2CO3 with the required amount
of solvent. The progress of both the Suzuki–Miyaura and Sonogashira
coupling reactions was monitored via TLC, and the desired product
was isolated by the column chromatographic technique.

4.5.4 Typical Procedure for Annulation Reaction
of 2-Iodoaniline and Phenylacetylene
Pd(OAc)2 (5
mol %), a specific amount of extract, 0.5 mmol 2-iodoaniline, 0.6
mmol phenylacetylene, and 1.5 mmol K2CO3 in
DMF were mixed in a 50 mL round-bottom flask. The mixture was then
allowed to stir at 90 °C, and the progress was monitored via
TLC. The reaction mixture was then extracted with ethyl acetate and
water, and the organic fraction was dried over Na2SO4 and concentrated in vacuum. The desired product was isolated
by column chromatography and characterized by 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy. Again considering the same substrate
ratio, the reaction was performed using 5 mol % of both the ex situ
Pd NPs, and the comparative conversion of each reaction was monitored
via TLC. Later, the reaction mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate,
dried over Na2SO4, and concentrated in vacuum.
The desired product was then isolated by the column chromatographic
technique and analyzed by NMR spectroscopy.
