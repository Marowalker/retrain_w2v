In
this work, we disclose an advanced general process for the synthesis
of tailor-made α-amino acids (α-AAs) via tandem alkylation–second-order
asymmetric transformation. The first step is the alkylation of the
chiral Ni(II) complex of glycine Schiff base, which is conducted under
mild phase-transfer conditions allowing the structural construction
of target α-AAs. The second step is based on the methodologically
rare second-order asymmetric transformation, resulting in nearly complete
precipitation of the corresponding (SC,RN,RC)-configured diastereomer, which can be collected by a simple
filtration. The operational convenience and potential scalability
of all experimental procedures, coupled with excellent stereochemical
outcome, render this method of high synthetic value for the preparation
of various tailor-made α-AAs.

Introduction
Amino acids (AAs) are
among a handful of paramount molecules involved
in virtually all aspects of the phenomenon of life. Quite naturally,
they played a significant role in organic, bioorganic, medicinal,
and pharmaceutical chemistry from the earliest days of modern healthcare
and life sciences.1 In particular, the
use of tailor-made2 AAs in the design of
peptides/peptidomimetics with restricted number of conformations and
precise positioning of the side-chains in the χ-space3 is a well-established paradigm in the modern
pharmaceutical industry.1,4,5 Quite interestingly, one of the emerging areas of tailor-made AA
application is the biological containment strategy of the produced
genetically modified organisms.6 Accordingly,
the current interest in the asymmetric synthesis of tailor-made AAs7 and their analogues, such as amino sulfonic,8 phosphonic,9 and fluorine-containing10 acids, is at an all-time high, targeting novel
structural motifs, functions, and properties. Consistent with our
continuous interest in asymmetric synthesis of various tailor-made
AAs, for example, fluorine-11 and phosphorus-containing,12 sterically constrained,13 and their nonlinear chiroptical properties, such as self-disproportionation
of enantiomers,14 we were actively developing
the Ni(II) complex chemistry of AA Schiff bases4d,7d,7e as a general approach for the preparation
of tailor-made AAs (Scheme 1).

Scheme 1 General Approach for the Asymmetric Synthesis of AAs
via Ni(II) Complexes
of Schiff Bases
As shown in Scheme 1, trichloro-substituted
ligand (S)- or (R)-1, currently the most frequently used source
of recyclable chirality in this method,15 is reacted with glycine and a source of Ni(II) ions to produce the
Schiff base complex 2.16 The
square-planar Ni(II) complex 2 serves as a versatile
chiral nucleophilic glycine equivalent to afford products 3 by the reactions with various electrophilic reagents. Most commonly
used reaction types include, for example, alkyl halide alkylations,17 Michael,18 aldol,19 and Mannich20 addition
reactions. Intermediate products 3 can be conveniently
disassembled to release target AAs 4–10 and to
recycle chiral tridentate ligand 1. This method can be
used for the preparation of general type α-AAs 4, β-functionalized/substituted derivatives 5,
sym-6,21 or chiral quaternary 7(22) α-AAs, in particular,
(1R,2S)-1-amino-2-vinylcyclopropane-1-carboxylic
acid 8(23) and bis-α-AAs
of type 9.24 Moreover, the
major advantage of this method over other well-developed general approaches7b,7c,25 is its exceptionally successful
application for kinetic resolution of unprotected α- and β-AAs
of types 4(26) and 10,27 respectively. This latter application
was shown to be competitive with traditionally economically attractive
enzymatic approaches.28 Most recently,
using the modular approach29 for the design
of chiral tridentate ligands, we developed a series of ligands featuring
free N–H functionality and multiple stereogenic centers.30 In particular, the adamantyl-containing derivative 11 (Scheme 2) was found to possess some remarkable physicochemical properties
for the development of second-order asymmetric transformation (SOAT)
approach for the general synthesis of α-AAs.31

Scheme 2 Applications of (S)-Rimantadine-Derived
Ligand 11; Previous Work on SOAT of Racemic α-AAs
and This
Work Dealing with Tandem Alkylation–SOAT, for General Asymmetric
Synthesis of α-AAs
As presented in Scheme 2, in the previous work, we demonstrated that the newly
designed
ligand 11 readily reacts with racemic α-AAs 12 to produce a mixture of four theoretically possible diastereomeric
products.31 However, because of the extreme
lipophilicity of the adamantyl moiety,32 one of the diastereomers, (SC,RN,RC)-configured 13, precipitates from the methanol or aqueous methanol solution,
thus driving the equilibrium of all other diastereomers to the one
major reaction product. As the next logical step in the advancement
of this methodology, we now report a tandem alkylation–SOAT
protocol, which includes synthesis of glycine Schiff base Ni(II) complex 14 and its alkylation under phase-transfer catalysis (PTC)
conditions followed by SOAT via equilibration/precipitation of major
products 15.

Results and Discussion
Unlike the
asymmetric synthesis, where the major product is a result
of preferential stereochemical interactions, which can be comprehended,
predicted, and rationally designed, the SOAT is essentially a serendipitous
approach resulting from rather complex and multifactorial interplay
of numerous chemical/steric/physical properties.33 Nevertheless, success in developing a SOAT process using
ligand 11 was predicated on the idea of “extreme”
lipophilic properties32 of the corresponding
rimantadine-containing Ni(II) complexes.31 Drawing from the previous results, we decided to extend the synthetic
versatility of this approach by preparing the required diastereomeric
complexes not via the reactions of ligand 11 with racemates
of the target α-AAs but via homologation of the intermediate
glycine derivative. To this end, we focused on the synthesis of required
glycine complexes 14 (Scheme 3).

Scheme 3 Optimized Conditions for the Preparation
of the Requisite Ni(II)
Complexes of Glycine (SC,RN)-14 and (SC,SN)-14
After some extensive experimentation, we found
that the application
of Na2CO3 as a base, in combination with catalytic
amounts of n-Bu4NI, provides for the most
practical preparation of the target glycine complexes (SC,RN)-14 and
(SC,SN)-14, in about 3:1 ratio. Under these conditions, using only
10% excess of glycine and the Ni(II) source allowed for the complete
conversion of the starting ligand (S)-11 to products 14, isolated with quantitative chemical
yield. Clean preparation of glycine complexes 14 was
very important part of the project allowing us to avoid any unnecessary
purification of the intermediate derivatives. Having achieved virtually
byproduct-less synthesis of glycine complexes 14, we
focused on the next alkylation step. On the basis of the previous
research,4d we selected PTC conditions34 allowing for very mild homologation of the glycine
moiety with usually excellent chemical yields. The results obtained
are summarized in Scheme 4.

Scheme 4 Alkylation of Ni(II) Complexes of Glycine (SC,RN)-14 and (SC,SN)-14 under PTC Conditions; Equilibration of Diastereomeric
Complexes 17–19 and 15 and Precipitation
of the
Final Major Product (SC,RN,RC)-15
As a model experiment, we selected
the alkylation reaction using m-bromobenzyl bromide 16 (Scheme 4). In this case, the expected
product 15a was previously obtained using the reaction
of racemic AA with ligand (S)-11,31 thus facilitating the identification and stereochemical
assignments. Starting glycine complexes 14 were used
as obtained, without any purification, as a 3:1 mixture of (SC,RN)-14 and (SC,SN)-14 diastereomers. We found that using 1,2-dichloroethane
as an organic solvent, 30% aqueous NaOH as a base, and 25 mol % of n-Bu4NI as a phase-transfer catalyst, virtually
complete consumption of starting glycine complexes 14 can be achieved in about 10 min of the reaction time. Analysis of
the reaction mixture by thin-layer chromatography (TLC) showed expected
alkylation products 15a as a major (>50%) product
and 17a–19a as minor products. The stereogenic
nitrogen
and AA α-carbon atoms in compounds 15a and 17a–19a are configurationally unstable. Therefore,
under the basic conditions, all four diastereomers undergo rapid epimerization
and interconversion via stepwise inversion of either nitrogen or α-carbon
or both atoms. Nonetheless, diastereomeric products 15a and 17a–19a are compounds of different chemical
properties, in particular, the solubility in a given solvent, providing
the opportunity for a SOAT process. Indeed, the major diastereomer
(SC,RN,RC)-15a was found to gradually precipitate
from the reaction mixture, leading to a progressive transformation
of more soluble 17a–19a to the crystalline precipitate
of compound 15a. Thus, after about 1 h of stirring at
room temperature, the reaction mixture was filtered affording diastereomerically
pure (SC,RN,RC)-15a with 92.4% yield.

This tandem alkylation–SOAT protocol was found to be of
general application for the preparation of various phenylalanine-type
tailor-made α-AAs. For example, the derivatives of p-bromo- (15b), p-chloro- (15c), p-trifluoromethyl- (15d), p-iodo- (15e), and p-nitro-substituted
(15f) phenylalanines were readily prepared in diastereomerically
pure form under the same conditions using filtration as the final
isolation procedure. Of particular interest is the preparation of
naphthylalanine derivative (SC,RN,RC)-15g, which was isolated with respectable chemical yield. In the case
of compounds 15c,e, and f,
the application of the standard conditions gave relatively lower isolated
yields of ∼50–56%. In this regard, we would like to
emphasize that relatively modest isolated yields are the result of
incomplete precipitation of the major diastereomer from the reaction
mixture. Furthermore, it should be noted that under the SOAT conditions,
the isolated yield depends on a physicochemical property which can
be conditioned by optimizing the solvent system for each particular
case.33 For instance, a gradual addition
of water to the reaction mixture leads to a lower solubility of products
allowing increasing precipitation of the target products. This possibility
was demonstrated on the example of product 15f, yield
of which was improved from 56.5 to 86.5% by adding about 20% of water
to the reaction mixture (see Supporting Information). It should be noted, however, that the diastereomeric purity of
thus prepared complex 15f was 93.2% de. On the other
hand, attempts to use this tandem procedure for the preparation of
α-AA-containing alkyl side-chains were unsuccessful. The major
problem we encountered was low reactivity of alkyl halides under the
PTC conditions.

Diastereomerically pure Ni(II) complexes 15 can be
readily disassembled to release the target AAs or their protected
derivatives.4d For example, diastereomer
(SC,RN,RC)-15a was treated with 3 N HCl
in methanol to produce m-bromo-phenylalanine (R)-20 and chiral ligand (S)-11 (Scheme 5). The latter, configurationally uncompromised, was almost
quantitatively recovered and reused for continuous synthesis of other
AAs.

Scheme 5 Disassembly of Diastereomerically Pure (SC,RN,RC)-15a; Isolation of Target Fmoc-Derivative of AA (R)-21 and Recycling of Chiral Ligand (S)-11
AA (R)-20 was not isolated
in analytically
pure form but transformed in situ to the corresponding Fmoc derivative
(R)-21. The standard protection protocol
with application of N-(9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyloxy)succinimide
(Fmoc-OSu) was used, with an exception that ethylenediaminetetraacetic
acid (EDTA) was added to chelate the Ni(II) ions.

In another
example, presented in Scheme 6, we demonstrate the isolation of free p-nitro-phenylalanine
(R)-23. Thus, after the disassembly
of diastereomerically pure Ni(II) complex
(SC,RN,RC)-15f in methanol under the action
of 3 N HCl, AA (R)-23 was isolated by
precipitation at the isoelectric point (pH 5.5) in the presence of
EDTA to chelate the Ni(II) ions. For the further use of this tailor-made
AA in our peptide-related projects, we also prepared Fmoc-protected
derivative (R)-24, similar to the preparation
of m-bromo-phenylalanine (R)-21 (Scheme 6).

Scheme 6 Disassembly of Diastereomerically Pure (SC,RN,RC)-15f; Isolation of Target-Free AA (R)-23 and Its Fmoc Derivative (R)-24, as Well as the Recycling of Chiral Ligand (S)-11
Conclusions
We demonstrate that Ni(II) complexes (SC,RN)- and (SC,SN)-14, derived from glycine
Schiff base and (S)-rimantadine, can be regioselectivity
alkylated on the glycine residue under the PTC conditions affording
a mixture of up to four diastereomeric products. Without purification,
the alkylated products can be submitted to the SOAT conditions allowing
a transformation of the diastereomeric mixture to single precipitated
stereoisomer 15 of (SC,RN,RC) absolute configuration. The operational convenience and
chromatography-free experimental procedures render this method of
potentially high synthetic value for the preparation of phenylalanine-type
tailor-made α-AAs.

Procedure for the Preparation of Ni(II) Complexes
by Reaction
of Ligand (S)-11 with Glycine
To a mixture of ligand (S)-11 (1.0
g, 2.22 mmol), nickel(II) nitrate hexahydrate (0.71 g, 2.44 mmol),
glycine (0.18 g, 2.44 mmol), tetrabutylammonium iodide (0.08 g, 10
mol %), and methanol (40 mL) was added sodium carbonate (1.18 g, 11.1
mmol), and the reaction mixture was stirred at reflux for 2 h. After
the ligand (S)-11 was consumed, the
reaction was quenched by pouring icy 5% aqueous acetic acid (200 mL)
to give a precipitate. The precipitate was filtrated, washed with
5% aqueous acetic acid, and dried in vacuo at 50 °C overnight
to afford the diastereomixture of Ni(II) complex (SC,RN)-14 and
(SC,SN)-14. A 3:1 ratio mixture of two diastereomers was obtained.
The spectral data were reported in our previous literature.

General
Procedure for the Preparation of Ni(II) Complexes via
Tandem Alkylation of Ni(II) Complexes of Glycine (SC,RN)-14 and
(SC,SN)-14
To a solution of Ni(II) complexes of glycine (SC,RN)-14 and (SC,SN)-14 (1 equiv) in 1,2-dichloroethane (8 volumes), 30%
aqueous sodium hydroxide solution (40 equiv) was added followed by
tetrabutylammonium iodide (25 mol %) and the corresponding alkyl halide
(1.1 equiv). After stirring at room temperature (rt) for 10–30
min, the reaction mixture was diluted with water and extracted with
dichloromethane; then, the organic layer was evaporated to dryness.
The obtained residue and potassium carbonate (4 equiv) were stirred
in methanol (40 volumes) at reflux for 1 h. After the reaction, several
amounts of water were dropped to the mixture to give a precipitate.
The precipitate was filtrated, washed with aqueous methanol, and dried
in vacuo at 60 °C overnight to afford the corresponding Ni(II)
complex.

Synthesis of Fmoc-(R)-m-bromo-phenylalanine,
(R)-21
To a suspension of (SC,RN,RC)-15a (740 mg, 1.01 mmol) in methanol (10
mL) was added 3 N HCl (1.68 mL, 5.04 mmol), and the reaction mixture
was heated at 50 °C for 1 h. Upon disappearance of the red color
of the starting complex, the reaction mixture was concentrated to
give a residue. To the residue were added water (10 mL) and ethyl
acetate (10 mL) and then the phases were separated. The organic phase
was washed with brine (10 mL), dried over sodium sulfate, and evaporated
under vacuum to afford the recycle ligand (S)-4 (488 mg, 99.3%). The aqueous phase was concentrated to give
crude AA (R)-20. The residue was dissolved
in water (14 mL) and tetrahydrofuran (THF) (7 mL) to which EDTA disodium
salt dihydrate (375 mg, 1.01 mmol) was added, and the reaction mixture
was basified with sodium carbonate (214 mg, 2.02 mmol) and sodium
bicarbonate (169 mg, 2.02 mmol). To this solution was added a solution
of Fmoc-OSu (374 mg, 1.11 mmol) in THF (7 mL) and stirred at rt for
16 h. After evaporation of the organic solvents, the aqueous residue
was acidified with 3 N HCl to pH 2 to give a precipitate. The precipitate
was filtered and washed with water (20 mL) to afford crude (R)-21. The crude solid thus obtained was recrystallized
from THF/IPE (1:1) and dried at 50 °C to afford (R)-21 (466 mg, 99.1%, 97.1% ee). The spectral data were
found to be identical with the commercial enantiopure sample. 1H NMR (200 MHz, DMSO-d6): δ
2.85 (dd, J = 10.4, 13.7 Hz, 1H), 3.10 (dd, J = 4.4, 13.7 Hz, 1H), 4.02–4.33 (m, 4H), 7.14–7.56

Synthesis of Fmoc-(R)-p-nitro-phenylalanine,
(R)-24
To a suspension of (SC,RN,RC)-15f (5 g, 7.14 mmol) in methanol (60 mL)
was added 3 N HCl (11.9 mL, 35.7 mmol), and the reaction mixture was
heated at 50 °C for 1 h. Upon disappearance of the red color
of the starting complex, the reaction mixture was concentrated to
give a residue. To the residue were added water (25 mL) and ethyl
acetate (50 mL) and then the phases were separated. The organic phase
was washed with brine (10 mL), dried over sodium sulfate, and evaporated
under vacuum to afford the recycle ligand (S)-4 (2.93 g, 84.1%). To the aqueous phase was added EDTA disodium
salt dihydrate (2.66 g, 7.14 mmol), and the reaction mixture was basified
with 48% sodium hydroxide to pH 13. After stirring at rt for 10 min,
the solution was acidified with 12 N HCl to pH 5.5 to give a precipitate.
The precipitate was filtered and washed with water (20 mL) to afford
AA (R)-23 (1.30 g, 86.6%). The AA (R)-23 thus obtained was dissolved in water
(50 mL) and THF (25 mL), and the reaction mixture was basified with
sodium carbonate (1.51 g, 14.3 mmol) and sodium bicarbonate (1.20
g, 14.3 mmol). To this solution was added a solution of Fmoc-OSu (2.41
g, 7.14 mmol) in THF (25 mL) and stirred at rt for 16 h. After evaporation
of the organic solvents, the aqueous residue was acidified with 3
N HCl to pH 2 to give a precipitate. The precipitate was filtered
and washed with water (50 mL) to afford crude (R)-24. The crude solid thus obtained was recrystallized from
THF/IPE (1:1) and dried at 50 °C to afford (R)-24 (2.59 g, 97.1%, 98.6% ee). The spectral data were
found to be identical with the commercial enantiopure sample. 1H NMR (200 MHz, DMSO-d6): δ
3.00 (dd, J = 10.9, 13.7 Hz, 1H), 3.24 (dd, J = 4.4, 13.7 Hz, 1H), 4.02–4.37 (m, 4H), 7.28 (dddd, J = 1.0, 3.2, 7.4, 7.4 Hz, 2H), 7.40 (ddd, J = 1.0, 7.4, 7.4 Hz, 2H), 7.54 (d, J = 8.6 Hz, 2H),
