A kind
of polymerizable dispersant based on natural rosin was used
to disperse single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) in aqueous solution
followed by in situ free-radical polymerization to achieve a controllable
SWNTs dispersion, that not only can be controlled by CO2/N2, but can also be recycled and redispersed in CO2-saturated water after drying without sonication.

Introduction
Single-walled carbon
nanotubes (SWNTs) have gained increasing interest
because of their excellent thermal, electronic, and mechanical properties.1 However, SWNTs tend to form aggregates because
of their strong π–π stacking, resulting in their
indispersibility in water and most conventional solvents,2 and these aggregates are problematic for some
practical applications where dispersed individual tubes are demanded.3 To solve this problem, covalent and noncovalent
approaches have been developed to modify SWNTs. Noncovalent functionalization
is superior to covalent functionalization because the latter generates
unwanted functional groups, changing the intrinsic electronic properties
of the SWNTs.4 In noncovalent functionalization,
amphiphilic molecules have often been used to disperse SWNTs such
as surfactants,5−9 DNA,10−13 ionic liquid,14 lipids,15 and polymers.4,16 However, once these
isolated SWNTs were freeze-dried, they were difficult to redisperse
in water again without sonication and instead formed aggregates.16

Although Kim16 reported a kind of water
redispersible SWNTs fabricated by the in situ polymerization of micelles,
SWNTs often need to be further modified with “intelligent”
surfaces to satisfy the demands of responsiveness to the environment
when they are used as sensors in medical or biological chemistry.17 SWNTs modified noncovalently with a responsive
surfactant have sparked great interest among researchers in recent
years because SWNTs not only were debundled but were also functionalized
“smartly”. Furthermore, the original structures and
properties of the SWNTs were preserved.18 Therefore, many kinds of responsive surfactants have been reported
to disperse SWNTs including pH,19−23 redox,24 temperature,21,25,26 and light26 responsive
surfactants. However, these systems required the addition of extra
acids, bases, or oxidants, which result in the accumulation of byproducts
and contamination of the system and utilization of UV–vis radiation
or changes in temperature are unattainable in some situations.27 Thus, as a green, biocompatible, cheap, and
easily removed trigger, CO2 has also been drawn increasing
attention.18,28 However, homogenizing these precipitated
hybrids after bubbling with N2 requires not only to be
bubbled with CO2 but also to be sonicated. Furthermore,
research studies on green chemistry have attracted widespread attention.29,30 Rosin is a renewable biomass resource secreted by pine trees. It
has excellent hydrophobicity because of its unique tricyclic rigid
structure, which is similar to that of cholic acid, and may effectively
interact with the hydrophobic surface of the SWNTs through interaction,
most likely π-stacking.22,31

Here, we report
a kind of CO2-responsive polymerizable
dispersant, maleopimaric acid glycidyl methacrylate ester 3-dimethylaminopropylamine
imide (MPAGN), based on natural rosin. It was used to disperse SWNTs
in aqueous solution followed by in situ free-radical polymerization
to achieve a controllable SWNT dispersion. This SWNT dispersion modified
by a noncovalent approach that not only can be controlled by CO2/N2, but can also be redispersed in CO2-saturated water after drying without sonication just requiring only
mild shaking.

Results and Discussion
The structures
of the SWNT samples were characterized by IR, 1H NMR, as
shown in Figures S1 and S2. The synthetic
route and reversible transformation of P-MPAGN between
its nonionic and cationic states are shown in Figure 1A and a schematic illustration of this dispersion
is shown in Figure 1B.

Figure 1 (A) Synthetic route and reversible transformation of P-MPAGN between
the cationic and nonionic states. (B) Schematic illustration of the
SWNTs dispersed by MPAGNH+ that are locked in by free-radical
polymerization in situ.

At first, neutral MPAGN
was protonated to form cationic MPAGNH+ by bubbling with
CO2 into solution to disperse
SWNTs and then the cationic MPAGNH+ was polymerized
on the surface of the SWNTs to obtain P-SWNTs dispersion; the
zeta potential of the P-SWNTs dispersion was approximately +58
mV. The electrostatic repulsion among the charged nanotubes can prevent
the bundling of debundled SWNTs. After N2 was bubbled through
the dispersion at 60 °C, the cationic P-SWNT hybrids were deprotonated
and the nonionic sample was formed leading to a decrease in the zeta
potential of the dispersion to nearly 0 mV. The electrostatic repulsion
disappeared among the nonionic P-SWNTs, and the P-SWNTs precipitated.
The nonionic P-SWNTs were protonated and returned to cationic P-SWNTs
by bubbling of the sample with CO2 leading to a zeta potential
of the dispersion returning to approximately +58 mV. This process
can be reversed several times without an obvious change in the zeta
potential of the dispersion as shown in Figure 2A. The transmittance of the dispersion at
600 nm was also measured to illustrate the responsiveness of the P-SWNTs
to CO2/N2. A black powder composed of P-SWNTs
settled out of solution by bubbling N2 through the water
solution at 60 °C with the transmittance at 600 nm of the supernatant
increasing, and this powder can be redispersed into water easily by
bubbling CO2 through the solution, resulting in the transmittance
at 600 nm decreasing to nearly 0. This reversal also can be repeated
many times without a marked change in the transmittance of the dispersion
at 600 nm, as shown in Figure 2B. The inserted photos compared the appearance of the P-SWNTs
after bubbling with N2 and bubbling with CO2. After precipitation by bubbling with N2, the precipitate
could be recovered and reused after drying. It can be redispersed
in a CO2-saturated water solution again with only mild
shaking and no visible aggregates appeared over a long time. The zeta
potential and transmittance of redispersed P-SWNTs dispersion after
being dried with bubbling with CO2 and N2 alternately is shown in Figure S3. The redispersed P-SWNTs dispersion after being dried also
can be responsive to CO2/N2 and the cycle zeta
potential, and transmittance of P-SWNTs dispersion after being
dried was almost no different from that of the freshly prepared
ones. It can be concluded that the drying operation has little influence
on the responsiveness of P-SWNTs.

drying and redispersed P-SWNTs after N2/CO2;
(D) TGA data for pristine SWNTs, dried U-SWNTs, and dried P-SWNTs.

As shown in Figure 2C, the UV–vis–NIR spectra of the U-SWNTs
and P-SWNTs
dispersion showed van Hove transition peaks, which indicated the existence
of individually isolated SWNTs in the U-SWNTs and P-SWNTs dispersion,16 and the UV–vis–NIR spectra of
P-SWNTs was almost the same as that of U-SWNTs. It can be concluded
that the optical properties of SWNTs were not destroyed after in situ
polymerization. The UV–vis–NIR spectra of the redispersed
P-SWNTs dispersion after responsiveness with N2/CO2 and that of dispersion after drying were basically in line
with that of the as-prepared sample, which indicated the excellent
responsiveness of the P-SWNTs to CO2 and their excellent
redispersibility after drying. The UV spectra of P-SWNTs prepared
after 1 month was basically in line with that of the freshly prepared
ones, which indicates the excellent durability of P-SWNTs dispersion,
as shown in Figure S4.

Thermogravimetric
analysis (TGA) was used to count the amount of
MPAGN or P-MPAGN attached to the nanotubes. These dispersions were
filtered through a membrane (0.22 μm) and dried before
measurement. The pristine SWNTs had lost little weight, while the
P-SWNTs had a 77.66% weigh loss at 800 °C, as shown in Figure 2D. This discrepancy
confirmed that the surfactant had been combined with SWNTs. In other
words, the ratio of P-MPAGN to SWNTs in P-SWNTs was 3.48:1 by weight.
However, U-SWNTs had a 53.9% weight loss at 800 °C, such that
the ratio of MPAGN to SWNTs in U-SWNTs was 1.17:1 by weight. It can
be concluded that the MPAGN in the U-SWNT sample was partially washed
away with the filter liquor in the process of filtration because the
intermolecular forces between MPAGN and SWNT were weak. The amount
of residue MPAGN attached to the SWNTs in the U-SWNTs was insufficient
to redisperse SWNTs in water. In addition, the intermolecular forces
between MPAGN and the SWNTs in the U-SWNTs may be destroyed by harsh
processing procedures, such as freeze-drying. Therefore, although
a black powder consisting of U-SWNTs also settled out of solution
after bubbling with either N2 or air through the aqueous
solution at 60 °C, it could not be redispersed in water after
freeze-drying by bubbling CO2 through the aqueous solution
without sonication, rather appearing to visibly aggregate. However,
the MPAGN monolayer on the SWNT surface was solidly locked in after
the in situ free-radical polymerization of P-SWNTs, therefore, the
P-SWNTs can be redispersed easily. The photographs of redispersion of
U-SWNTs and P-SWNTs after drying are shown in Figure S5.

The SWNTs exhibited bundled
and networked microstructures in water,
as shown in Figure S6A. However, some well-dispersed
and individualized nanotubes of U-SWNTs with diameters of 10–12
nm were observed from the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image,
as shown in Figure 3A, which were larger than those of the original SWNTs (approximately
2 nm). This could indicate that a thick MPAGNH+ layer was
attached to the surface of the nanotubes effectively. After polymerization,
the diameter of the individual tubes of the P-SWNTs shown in Figure 3B was larger than
that of the U-SWNTs, from which it can be concluded that the polymerization
of MPAGNH+ has reacted on the surface of the nanotubes
and the obtained polymer MPAGNH+ has been wrapped around
the surface of the nanotubes and prevent the bundling of the SWNTs.
The diameter of individualized nanotubes wrapped by MPAGN was much
larger than that of the ones wrapped by surfactants based on long-chain
alkane because of the steric hindrance of large rigid structures.
After bubbling with N2, the P-SWNTs precipitated from the
aqueous solution, and its TEM image is shown in Figure 3C. When CO2 was bubbled through
the solution again, the P-SWNT hybrid suspension became homogeneous
without the need for sonication, and the polymer was still wrapped
around the surface of the SWNTs, based on their diameters, as shown
in Figure 3D. The same
was seen for the redispersion after drying, as shown in Figure S6B. Therefore, P-SWNT could be redispersed
in CO2-saturated water without sonication, requiring only
mild shaking.

P-SWNTs after bubbling N2; (D) P-SWNTs after responding
to CO2.

To clarify the influence
of the dispersion treatment on the intrinsic
properties of SWNTs, Raman spectrometry was carried out because it
was sensitive to the change in both the electronic and optical properties
of SWNTs. If there was charge transfer or the optical property change
of SWNTs, the shift and peak shape change of the G band and radial
breathing mode (RBM) would be observed. The tangential (G) band at
1589.7 cm−1 and the represent active second disordered
band (D) at 2678.3 cm−1 were revealed from the Raman
spectrometry of SWNTs, respectively. RBM of the nanotubes was found
at 100–200 cm–1. However, the Raman spectra
of U-SWNTs and P-SWNTs were almost the same as that of raw SWNTs as
shown in Figure 4.
It can be concluded that there was no charge transfer between the
surfactant and SWNTs and the intrinsic optical properties and electronic
properties of SWNTs were still reserved.

U-SWNTs, and P-SWNTs.

Conclusions
In
summary, SWNTs were modified by a CO2-switchable
polymerizable dispersant based on natural rosin in water followed
by in situ free-radical polymerization, and the tubes were wrapped
by the obtained polymer. The dispersion and precipitation in an aqueous
solution can be controlled reversibly by bubbling with CO2 or N2. After precipitation, the polymer surfactant-fabricated
SWNTs could be redispersed in water after drying without the need
for sonication, requiring only mild shaking because the polymer was
still solidly attached to the surface of the SWNTs after either bubbling
with N2 or drying, while the MPAGN-fabricated SWNTs without
polymerization could not.

Experimental Section
MPAGN was synthesized
following our previous report.32 A mixture
of MPAGN (8 mg) and SWNTs (0.8 mg)
in water (24 mL) bubbled with CO2 was treated by sonication
for 20 min (750 W and 20 kHz, Sonics), followed by centrifugation
at 8000 rpm for 10 min to obtain a homogeneous dispersion of SWNTs
with an adsorbed layer of MPAGN (U-SWNTs). The MPAGN monolayer on
the SWNT surface was locked in by in situ free-radical polymerization
(P-SWNTs), and the initiator was 2,2′-azobis(2-methylpropionamide)dihydrochloride
(V50). The dispersion was filtered through membranes (0.22 μm)
to remove the unreacted monomer and poly-MPAGN that was not wrapped
around the SWNTs (P-MPAGN).
