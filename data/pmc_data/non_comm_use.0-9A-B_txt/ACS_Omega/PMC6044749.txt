The efficiency of a fluorescence
sensing device based on metal-enhanced
fluorescence (MEF) is dependent on the optimization of interaction
between the fluorophore and the metal nanoparticle (NP). Herewith,
ultrasensitive and selective turn-on sensing of Au3+ is
achieved by using a suitable combination of fluorophore and metal
NP system through sequential MEF effect. Dansyl hydrazide-tagged Ag
NPs in the polyacryloyl hydrazide cavity are utilized to sense the
picomolar concentration of Au3+ in aqueous media. We demonstrated
that the selective Au3+ sensing is due to the selective
deposition of Au on the Ag NP surface over the 16 other metal ions
studied. The sensitivity is assigned to the strong overlapping of
the emission band of the fluorophore with the surface plasmon band
of the Au and improvement of fluorescence signal through successive
MEF by Ag and Au colloids. The sensing is associated with a fivefold
increase in fluorescence intensity and appearance of violet color
of the solution. These luminescent Ag–Au bimetallic NPs may
be utilized to trace cancer cells in biological systems and for cell
imaging applications.

Introduction
Gold (Au) is precious
to human being since ancient times because
of its esthetic qualities. Au cations have also displayed promising
medicinal qualities and are used in the treatment of tuberculosis
and rheumatoid arthritis.1 At the same
time, the Au cations, especially Au3+, are reported to
be toxic toward human2 and aquatic species.3 The above toxicity of soluble Au3+ is attributed to its selective binding ability toward DNA4 and enzymes.5 Au3+ is responsible for enzyme depletion and protein denaturation
against selective cellular targets and lysosomal dysfunction, which
subsequently results in DNA and membrane damage.6 Au3+ also promotes the oxidative DNA damage
by catalyzing the free-radical generation of various chemical entities
frequently used in biochemical and biological studies.7 The Au salts cause serious damage to kidney, liver, and
peripheral nervous system.8 Therefore,
sensing tools to determine the concentration of Au3+ selectively
with high sensitivity are desirable. In this regard, a number of reports
on the sensing of Au cations in both aqueous9 and organic10 media are available in
the literature. Sensing of Au ion in aqueous media is advantageous
to detect the contamination in biological systems. Out of the various
modes of sensing available for the detection of Au3+, the
fluorescence mode is advantageous because of its operational simplicity
and ultrasensitivity.11 Au nanoparticles
(NPs) are known to be strong fluorescence quenchers because of the
associated energy-transfer processes;12 therefore, turn-off fluorescence sensors for the detection of Au
are reported in the literature. Turn-on sensors for Au3+ are also reported in the literature in which the Au3+ ion acts as a catalyst and chemically transforms the nonfluorescent
probe to a fluorescent one.13 However,
the sensitivity is limited to micromolar concentrations because [Au3+] in above range is necessary to catalyze the sensing reaction.

NP-based probes for sensing applications have gained immense attention
recently because of their high detection threshold,14 low cost, fast response, high surface area, and portability.15 A range of chemical,16 optical,17 electrochemical, biological,18 and pH19 sensors
based on NPs are available in the current literature.20 Nanosensors are promising especially in the area of biosensing
because of the possibility of real-time and nonevasive monitoring
of intracellular activities,21 tracing
disease biomarkers,22 and toxic chemicals.23 Metallic NPs possessing size- and shape-dependent
optical properties or surface plasmon resonance are useful in colorimetric
and fluorescence sensing applications.24 Furthermore, because surface functionalization of these metallic
NPs with different ligands alters their optical properties,25 a variety of available surface-modified NPs
broaden their applicability in the area of sensors. Dye labeling of
the NPs is an attractive technique to impart unique emissive properties
through plasmon-controlled fluorescence or metal-enhanced fluorescence
(MEF) mechanism. MEF is dependent on the interaction between the fluorophore
and the metal NPs, shapes and sizes of the metal NPs, and the distance
between these NPs and the fluorophore. This enhancement is attributed
to the radiative rate modification of the fluorophore in the close
proximity of a metal NP.26 As per the common
understanding, strong overlapping of the excitation/emission band
of the fluorophore with the surface plasmon band of the metal NP is
anticipated to induce maximum fluorescence enhancement in the system.27

Therefore, careful selection of dye and
metal NP system is important
to design a highly sensitive fluorescence sensing device. Herewith,
a dye-labeled Ag NP system stabilized by the polyacryloyl hydrazide
(PAHz) cavity is designed to sense Au3+. PAHz is chosen
as the stabilizing agent for multiple reasons. First, instant formation
of Ag and Au NPs is possible in the PAHz solution under room-temperature
conditions.28 Second, covalent dye labeling
of the PAHz-Ag NPs is possible by utilizing the swift reactivity of
carbonyl hydrazide with a range of functional groups.29 Last, the PAHz cavity around the metal NPs may act as a
spacer layer and provide the much needed gap between the fluorophore
and the NPs. Au is known to quench the fluorescence at shorter distances
(<2 nm)30 and exhibit MEF at longer
distances (≥20 nm).31,32 The procedure allows
cost-effective and reagent-free one-pot synthesis of dye-labeled Ag
NPs. Dansyl hydrazide (DH) possessing emission maximum (∼510
nm) similar to the surface plasmon band of Au NP (525 nm) and low
(0.01) quantum yield (QY) is chosen as the fluorophore to offer strong
interaction and achieve maximum sensing sensitivity through optimized
MEF. Ag NP is anticipated to induce primary MEF to the DH in PAHz-DH-Ag
NP. In the presence of Au3+, possible deposition of Au
on Ag NP to form the corresponding Ag–Au bimetallic NP in the
PAHz cavity is expected to improve the signal through a secondary
MEF and to create the possibility of turn-on sensing of Au ion. Therefore,
PAHz-DH-Ag NPs are synthesized, and their efficiency in sensing Au3+ at different concentrations in aqueous media is studied.
The use of these highly fluorescence-enhanced bimetallic nano-objects
in cell imaging and sensing of intracellular pH is accessed.

(PtBr2, Sigma-Aldrich, 98%), and cesium chloride (CsCl3·7H2O, Qualigens, >99.9%) were used without

refluxed over sodium metal and benzophenone overnight and distilled
under a nitrogen atmosphere prior to use. Water used for the preparation
of aqueous solution was obtained by deionization and filtration with
a Millipore Elix-10 purification apparatus. The electrical conductivity
of deionized water is 0.0054 mS/cm.

Characterization
A LabIndia UV–VIS 3200 instrument
was used to record the ultraviolet–visible (UV–vis)
spectra of the sample. UV–vis spectra were recorded at 1 nm/min
scan rate. A Cary Eclipse fluorescence spectrophotometer (serial no.
MY14270004) was used to record the fluorescence spectra of the sample.
The spectrophotometer uses a xenon flash lamp for superior sensitivity,
high signal-to-noise ratio, and fast kinetics. Fluorescence spectra
were recorded at every 12.5 ms and scanned at 24 000 nm/min
without peak shifts.

Field-emission scanning electron microscopy
(FESEM) images were recorded using a Carl Zeiss-Sigma field-emission
microscope operating at an acceleration voltage of 3 kV. Samples were
prepared by drop-casting the polymer solution on a silver foil. The
samples were sputtered with gold before recording the images.

Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), high-resolution TEM (HRTEM),
and high-angle annular dark-field scanning TEM (STEM) data were recorded
on the JEOL JEM-2100 and FEI Tecnai G2 F20 electron microscopes operating
at 200 kV. For the TEM and HRTEM measurements, a drop of the PAHz-DH-Ag
NP and PAHz-DH-Ag–Au NP solution was dispensed onto a 3 mm
carbon-coated copper grid. Excess solution was removed with an absorbent
paper, and the sample was dried under vacuum at room temperature.
An energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX/EDS) analyzer attached
to the TEM operating in the STEM mode was used to analyze PAHz-DH-Ag
NPs and PAHz-DH-Ag–Au NPs. The selected-area electron diffraction
(SAED) and ring diffraction patterns of PAHz-DH-Ag–Au NPs were
analyzed using a CrysTBox tool.33

The size distribution curves of the particles present in the solutions
were measured by the dynamic light scattering (DLS) approach using
a Zetasizer Nano-ZS instrument (Malvern) equipped with a green laser
(523 nm). The intensity of scattered light was detected at an angle
of 173.1°. For each sample, three measurements were performed.
The data processing was carried out using the Zetasizer software 7.10
(Malvern Instruments). The size distributions were reported as volume
and number distributions.

Time-resolved fluorescence intensity
decays were obtained using
a commercial time-correlated single photon counting setup (LifeSpec
II, Edinburgh Instruments, U.K.). All samples were excited at 376
nm, and the full width at half-maxima of the instrument response function
(IRF) is 110 ps. For lifetime measurements, peak counts of 4096 were
collected with the emission polarizer oriented at magic-angle polarization,
and decays were collected at 506 nm. The time-resolved fluorescence
intensity decays were analyzed by deconvoluting the observed decays
with the IRF to obtain the intensity decay function, manifested as
a sum of three exponentials for the present study.34

Synthesis of PAHz
PAHz was synthesized
following a
previously reported procedure.28

Synthesis
of PAHz-DH
To an aqueous solution of PAHz
(0.02 g/mL) in 2 mL of deionized water, DC (0.47 mM) was added at
room temperature, and the mixture was stirred for 40 min. The progress
of the reaction was monitored by UV–vis and fluorescence spectrophotometer.
The plateauing of fluorescence intensity at 506 nm was considered
to be completion of the reaction and formation of PAHz-DH.

Synthesis
of PAHz-DH-Ag NPs
A typical synthetic procedure
is described below. The aqueous solution of PAHz-DH (0.02 g/mL) and
AgNO3 (30 μM) was mixed together and stirred at room
temperature for 30 min. The color of the solution turned to light
yellow, suggesting the PAHz-DH-Ag NP formation. The characterizations
of PAHz-DH-Ag NPs were done by using UV–vis, fluorescence,
TEM, DLS, and SEM analyses.

Sensing of Different Metal Ions
To confirm the selectivity
of the sensor, various metal ions (Au3+, Cs3+, Ca2+, Co2+, Cu2+, Cd2+, Fe2+, Mg2+, Ni2+, Zn2+, Ag+, Pt2+, Hg2+, Sn2+, Cr3+, Ti4+, and Pb2+) (20–800
pM) were added to an aqueous solution of PAHz-DH-Ag NP (0.02 g/mL),
and the fluorescence was recorded after 40 s of the addition of metal
ions. The change in intensity versus metal ion concentration was monitored
to understand the sensing efficiency of the PAHz-DH-Ag NPs.

Culture
and Maintenance of HEK293 Cells
HEK293 cells
were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM)
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). All cells were supplemented
with an antibiotic–antimycotic solution (100 units penicillin,
0.1 mg mL–1 streptomycin, and 0.25 mg mL–1 amphotericin B) and grown at 37 °C under standard cell culture
conditions (5% CO2, 95% humidity). HEK293T cells were adhered
to the cover slip for 24 h before the study.

Fluorescent Confocal Imaging
HEK293 cells after 20
min incubation with dye-labeled Ag or Ag–Au NPs at pH 8.0 or
5.4 with appropriate controls were washed with 1× phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS) and were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at
40 °C. Imaging was done using an Olympus BX61-FV1200-MPE microscope
equipped with a 405 nm laser using 40× oil (1.3NA) objective
with 8.0 μs/pixel scan speed or by a fluorescent microscope
Leica DMI6000 20× objective. Cropped images were assembled for
presentation in Adobe Photoshop (version 7.1).

XTT Assay
HEK293
cells were grown in complete culture
media (DMEM with 10% FBS) in 5% CO2 and 95% humidity at
37 °C. The cells were seeded into 96-well plates at a density
of 50 000 cells per well in culture media, and then 1 μM,
500 μM, and 1 mM concentrations were added in quadruplicates
of PAHz-DH-Ag–Au NPs. The cells were incubated with the NPs
for 20 min after which the medium was removed and fresh medium was
added along with the kit reagents as followed in the kit protocol
(cell proliferation kit II, Roche, Cat no. 11465015001). After 6 h
incubation with the reagent, absorbance was measured using an ELISA
plate reader at 480 nm.

Fluorescent Imaging
HEK293 cells
after 60 min preincubation
with Au NPs with appropriate controls were washed with 1× PBS
and were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at 40 °C.
Imaging was done using a fluorescent microscope Leica DMI6000 20×
and 40× objective. The dye was excited using filters with excitation
in the range of 340–380 nm, and emission was collected at 425
nm. The Au NP preincubated HEK293 cells were further incubated for
30 min with PAHz-DH-Ag NPs. The cells were washed with 1× PBS
and were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at 40 °C,
and images were recorded.

Results and Discussion
DH was covalently labeled to PAHz by reacting DC (CONHNH2/DC = 500:1, mol/mol) with PAHz in aqueous solution at 25 °C
(Figure 1). Appearance
of an absorption maximum (λmax) at 330 nm after 5
min of reaction time suggested the formation of PAHz-DH (Figure 2A). The intensity
of emission maxima at 506 nm gradually increased with time and reached
a plateau after 30 min, suggesting the completion of reaction (Figure 2B).a

were maintained in the preparation of all the compositions. All the
spectra were recorded after 30 min of the addition of Ag+ to PAHz-DH solution. The excitation wavelength was 325 nm for recording
the fluorescence spectra. The fluorescence was monitored in the 335–650
nm range. The absorbance and intensity values presented in “C”
and “D”, respectively, are the average of five experiments
and are provided with error bars.

The PAHz-DH-Ag NPs were synthesized by the in situ reduction
of
Ag+ in the PAHz-DH solution by the CONHNH2 functionality
and capping of the resulting Ag NP with CONHNH2 as similarly
reported recently.28 The λmax at 410 nm attributable to the surface plasmon band of Ag NP appeared
within 5 min of the addition of Ag+ at 25 °C and reached
a plateau by 30 min of reaction time (Supporting Information, Figure S1). The fluorescence intensity at 506
nm simultaneously increased with the formation of Ag NP, suggesting
fluorescence enhancement of DH by the Ag NP. Because the MEF effect
is sensitive to the thickness of the spacer layer and the concentration
of the metal NPs, the enhancement factor was optimized by varying
the [Ag+] and [PAHz] in solution. For a fixed [PAHz], the
absorbance at 410 nm gradually increased with [Ag+], suggesting
an increase in Ag NP amount in solution (Figure 2C, Supporting Information, Figure S2). The fluorescence intensity was maximum for the PAHz-DH-Ag
NPs prepared using 0.02 g/mL PAHz in solution (Figure 2D, Supporting Information, Figure S3). For any particular [PAHz] in between 0.01 and 0.1 g/mL,
optimum intensity was noticed in the presence of 15–50 μM
of [Ag+]. The fluorescence intensity of the samples strongly
decreased on increasing the [Ag+] beyond 50 μM. Therefore,
the PAHz-DH-Ag NPs synthesized using 0.02 g/mL [PAHz], 0.48 mM DC,
and 30 μM [Ag+] were used for further studies.

The above NPs were mostly spherical in nature with diameters in
the range of 10–20 nm (Figure 3A). The average particle size (davg) of the PAHz-DH-Ag NPs in solution was ∼61 nm with
a polydispersity index value of 0.3 (Figure 3B, Supporting Information, Figure S4). The PAHz cavity thickness around the Ag NP was approximated
to be half the difference between davg values obtained from the DLS and TEM analyses and found to be ∼25
nm. The FESEM analysis of the PAHz-DH-Ag NPs displayed uniform particles
with diameters in the range of 40–80 nm, supporting the DLS
data (Supporting Information, Figure S5).

presence of various metal ions (300 pM).

Various metal salts in picomolar amounts were added to the
aqueous
solution of PAHz-DH-Ag NP, and the change in spectroscopic properties
was monitored. In the presence of 40 pM Au3+ in the PAHz-DH-Ag
NP solution, a λmax at 537 nm accountable to the
surface plasmon band of Au NP appeared, suggesting the formation of
Ag–Au bimetallic NP (Figure 4A). The increase in absorbance of the λmax at 537 nm with Au3+ amount and the isosbestic point at
465 nm supported the gradual deposition of Au on the Ag NP surface.
The TEM image displayed the d-spacing values for
both Ag (2.22 Å) and Au (2.35 Å) and supported the formation
of Ag–Au bimetallic NP (Figure 4B). The spherical shape of the Ag NPs changed to prism
on the formation of Ag–Au bimetallic NP. The UV–vis
trace of the resulting PAHz-DH-Ag–Au NP was similar to that
of the Ag–Au nanoprism reported earlier.35 The EDS elemental mapping revealed the presence of both
Ag and Au in the NP, and the overlay mapping suggested the presence
of Au on the surface (Figure 4C–E, Supporting Information, Figure S6). The ratio between Ag and Au was measured to be ∼99.92:0.08
(w/w) (Supporting Information, Figure S7).

Figure 4 (A) UV–vis
traces of PAHz-DH-Ag NP (0.02 g/mL) in the presence
of different amounts of Au3+, (B) TEM image of PAHz-DH-Ag–Au
NP, EDS elemental mapping of (D) Ag, (E) Au, and (C) overlay mapping
of PAHz-DH-Ag–Au NPs prepared using 0.02 g/mL PAHz-DH-Ag NP
and 300 pM Au3+.

The davg value of the PAHz-DH-Ag
NP
increased to 80 nm in the presence of 300 pM Au3+, supporting
the formation of the above bimetallic NP (Figure 3B). The formation of the corresponding Ag–Au
NP is associated with the oxidation of carbonyl hydrazide functionality
of PAHz. However, because the amount of CONHNH2 functionality
(mM) present in the solution is ∼1010 times higher
than that of Au3+ (pM) added to the solution, the oxidative
change may be negligible, and the PAHz cavity thickness is assumed
to remain unaltered during the NP formation process. The davg gradually increased from ∼63 to ∼119
nm on increasing [Au3+] and from 25 to 800 pM in the PAHz-DH-Ag
NP (0.02 g/mL) solution, suggesting that the amount of Au3+ in the solution controlled the Au thickness in the resulting Ag–Au
bimetallic NPs (Supporting Information,
Figure S4). The SAED image supported the presence of both the metals
and the crystalline nature of the bimetallic NPs (Supporting Information, Figure S8).

To realize the possibility
of the Ag–Au alloy NP formation
using the procedure, both Ag+ and Au3+ in different
molar proportions were added together to the PAHz solution (0.02 g/mL),
and the mixture was incubated at 40 °C for 2 h. The UV–vis
analysis revealed a single plasmon band for each of the compositions
(Figure 5A). The λmax gradually red-shifted from 425 to 545 nm on increasing
the Au3+ content in the reacting mixture, suggesting the
formation of the Ag–Au alloy NP (Figure 5B). The dependence of absorption maxima on
the ratio between Ag and Au content in alloy NPs is well-documented
in the literature.36,37 The absorbance values of the
Ag–Au alloy NPs were lower than that of the Ag and Au NP, which
supported the theoretical values calculated by using the Mie equation.38

The spectra were recorded after incubating the mixture at 40 °C
for 2 h. (B) Effect of Au3+ mol fraction in Ag+ and Au3+ mixture on the absorption maxima of the corresponding
PAHz-DH-Ag–Au alloy NP.

The fluorescence signal of DH further improved with increase
in
[Au3+], suggesting successive MEF by the Ag–Au NP
(Figure 6A). A noticeable
increase in fluorescence intensity at 506 nm occurred in the presence
of 40 pM Au3+ within ∼5 s. The intensity value reached
a plateau within 40 s of the addition of Au3+ (Supporting Information, Figure S9). Recently,
a boron-dipyrromethene (BODIPY) Schiff base has been reported for
instant turn-on detection of Au3+ in the nanomolar concentration.39 Nanoporous alumina-based interferometric sensor
is also used for instant detection of micromolar amount of Au3+.8 The current procedure allows
real-time monitoring of Au3+ and higher sensitivity compared
to that of the existing procedures. Optimum enhancement (∼fivefold)
was noticed for [Au3+] in the range of 100–300 pM
(Figure 6B). The color
of the solution also appeared to be green under UV light, suggesting
that these PAHz-DH-Ag NPs may be used for fluorescence sensing of
picomolar amount of Au3+ in turn-on fashion (Figure 6C). A range of other metal
ions in molar proportions (100 pM) similar to that of Au3+ were also added to the PAHz-DH-Ag NP solution, and fluorescence
data were recorded after ∼40 s of incubation period. The fluorescence
enhancement was selective to Au3+ only among the 17 metal
ions studied (Figure 6D, Supporting Information, Figure S10).
The interference of other metal ions toward the sensing of Au3+ was investigated by adding Au3+ (100 pM) to the
PAHz-DH-Ag NP solution (0.02 g/mL) along with another metal ion (100
pM) in the same molar proportion. The UV–vis and fluorescence
traces remained mostly unaffected by the presence of other ions, suggesting
that the sensing is robust and insensitive toward the presence of
other metal ions. In fact, the sensing of Au3+ was equally
efficient in the presence of multiple metal ions (Supporting Information, Figure S11). The interference of other
metal ions toward the davg value of the
resulting PAHz-DH-Ag–Au NP was also negligible, suggesting
that the deposition of Au on the Ag NP was least affected by the presence
of other metal ions in solution (Supporting Information, Figure S12).

wavelength was 325 nm. The fluorescence was monitored in the 335–650
nm range. (B) Effect of [Au3+] on the fluorescence intensity

average of five experiments. (C) Color of the PAHz-DH-Ag NP solution

of different metal ions (100 pM). The incubation time was 40 s for
all the metal ions. The values in “B” and “D”
are provided with error bars.

The ultrasensitivity of PAHz-DH-Ag NPs toward Au3+ may
have resulted from a strong interaction between the dye and the NP
through the matching of surface plasmon band of the Au NP (537 nm)
with that of the emission band of DH (506 nm).40 Spectral overlap between the fluorophore and plasmon-resonant
metal NPs is known to reinforce their fluorescence properties.41 The color of the PAHz-DH-Ag NP solution (0.02
g/mL) turned green under UV light within 5 s of the addition of 75
pM or higher Au3+ (Figure 6C). The QY = Krad/(Krad + Knon-rad) of the resulting PAHz-DH-Ag–Au NP increased to 0.49 from
0.07 (PAHz-DH-Ag NP) (Figure 7, Supporting Information, Table
S1). Interestingly, the average fluorescence lifetime [τ = 1/(Krad + Knon-rad)] of the PAHz-DH-Ag–Au NPs (∼13.1 ns) also experienced
a sevenfold increase compared to that of the PAHz-DH-Ag NP (1.8 ns).
Possibly, the replacement of Ag with Ag–Au NP has not substantially
altered the radiative decay rate (Krad) of the fluorophore. Other quenching processes including aggregation
of fluorophores may also be minimal because of the covalent attachment
of the dye to the PAHz cavity and fairly low concentration of DH (DH/CONHNH2 = 1:500, mol/mol) in the solution. Therefore, the QY and
τ changed proportionally to each other.

NPs. Inset: QY and average lifetime (τ) data of both the NPs.

We have previously shown that
PAHz-Ag NPs are pH-responsive and
are capable of penetrating and delivering drugs in cancer cells.28 The pH-responsive fluorescent properties of
a porphyrin moiety in the vicinity of PAHz-Ag NPs have also been reported
recently.42 The pH responsiveness of the
optical properties of the luminescent PAHz-DH-Ag–Au bimetallic
NPs synthesized in this report was investigated to explore their utility
in cell imaging and tumor detection applications. Because the pH of
the cancerous cell environment is ∼5.4, the UV–vis and
fluorescence spectra of the PAHz-DH-Ag–Au NP were recorded
under pH 5.4 conditions and compared to that of the data at pH 8.0
(pH of 0.02 g/mL PAHz). The fluorescence intensity of the PAHz-DH-Ag–Au
NP solution exhibited ∼12-fold decrease on changing the pH
from 8.0 to 5.4, whereas the change in the absorbance value associated
with the above change in pH was marginal (Figure 8A,B). The davg value decreased by ∼43% on changing the pH to 5.4, suggesting
that the PAHz cavity thickness around the Ag–Au NP shrank under
the acidic pH (Figure 8C). The above change in the spacer thickness may have affected the
MEF of the fluorophore in the system (Figure 8B). To understand the intracellular behavior
of the PAHz-coated Ag–Au NP, both PAHz-DH-Ag and PAHz-DH-Ag–Au
NPs were incubated for 20 min in HEK293 cells under pH 8.0 and 5.4
conditions, and the confocal images were acquired. The fluorescence
of PAHz-DH-Ag–Au NPs substantially increased compared to that
of the PAHz-DH-Ag NPs in the cells, suggesting that the former may
be used for cell imaging applications (Figure 8D1,D2). More importantly, the fluorescence
of PAHz-DH-Ag–Au NPs notably decreased on changing the pH from
8.0 to 5.4 (Figure 8D3). These results suggested that PAHz-DH-Ag–Au NPs act as
a pH-dependent fluorescent sensor, which may have potential for the
identification of solid tumors. We also performed the 2,3-bis(2-methoxy-4-nitro-5-sulfophenyl)-5-[(phenylamino)carbonyl]-2H-tetrazolium hydroxide (XTT) assay to see the effect of
NPs on cytotoxicity. We used PAHz-DH-Ag–Au NPs for this assay
because these have the highest concentration of metals. No cytotoxicity
on HEK293 cells was noticed for NPs loading up to 500 μM (Figure 8E). The HEK293 cells
preincubated with Au3+ for 1 h were exposed to the PAHz-DH-Ag
NP probe.

Figure 8 (A) UV–vis, (B) fluorescence spectra, and (C) DLS traces
of PAHz-DH-Ag–Au NP solution under different pH conditions;
the excitation wavelength for the fluorescence spectra was 325 nm.
The fluorescence was monitored in the 335–650 nm range. Confocal
images of the HEK293 cells after incubation with (D1) PAHz-DH-Ag,
(D2) PAHz-DH-Ag–Au NPs at pH 8.0, and (D3) PAHz-DH-Ag–Au
NPs at pH 5.4 conditions, and the images were acquired using 40×
objectives and a 405 nm laser. (E) XTT assay of the PAHz-DH-Ag–Au
NPs. The experiment was conducted in quadruplicates, and the data
show the mean ± SEM of the absorbance at 480 nm. *p < 0.05 compared to vehicle by one-way ANOVA followed by Newman–Keuls
post hoc analysis. Statistical analyses were performed using the Graphpad
Prism 5 software.

As anticipated, the fluorescence
of the probe increased in the
cells, suggesting that these PAHz-DH-Ag NPs may be used for the intracellular
detection of Au3+ (Supporting Information, Figure S13). These preliminary results suggest PAHz-DH-Ag–Au
NP to be an important fluorescent biosensor for detecting the change
in pH in cellular environments, which might have diagnostic potential
for solid tumors.

Conclusions
The dye-labeled PAHz-capped
Ag NP can be used as the reactive probe
for instant fluorescent detection of picomolar amount of Au3+ in aqueous and biological environments. In the presence of Au3+, the PAHz-DH-Ag NP converts to the PAHz-DH-Ag–Au
bimetallic NP, and the fluorescence signal enhancement of DH occurs
owing to strong MEF by Au. The PAHz cavity thickness around the metal
NP and the covalent attachment of the dye play important roles in
optimizing the signal enhancement of the fluorophore. These bimetallic
NPs are pH-responsive and promptly change their size in response to
change in pH, which alters their optical properties. Owing to the
above conditions, these fluorescent-enhanced PAHz-DH-Ag–Au
NPs may be used for cell imaging as well as optical detection of solid
tumors. These bimetallic NPs are cytocompatible up to 500 μM
loading. This procedure may be extended to synthesize Ag–Au
alloy NPs. In future, drug may be loaded in these luminescent pH-responsive
alloy NPs for simultaneously diagnostic as well as therapeutic applications.

a DC on reaction with CONHNH2 formed the DH moiety, which is fluorescent in nature, and the corresponding
peak was observed at 506 nm and the intensity gradually increased
with conversion of DC to DH.
