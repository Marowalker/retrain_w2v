Algae, plants, bacteria,
and fungi contain flavin-binding light-oxygen-voltage
(LOV) domains that function as blue light sensors to control cellular
responses to light. In the second LOV domain of phototropins, called
LOV2 domains, blue light illumination leads to covalent bond formation
between protein and flavin that induces the dissociation and unfolding
of a C-terminally attached α helix (Jα) and the N-terminal
helix (A′α). To date, the majority of studies on these
domains have focused on versions that contain truncations in the termini,
which creates difficulties when extrapolating to the much larger proteins
that contain these domains. Here, we study the influence of deletions
and extensions of the A′α helix of the LOV2 domain of Avena sativa phototropin 1 (AsLOV2)
on the light-triggered structural response of the protein by Fourier-transform
infrared difference spectroscopy. Deletion of the A′α
helix abolishes the light-induced unfolding of Jα, whereas extensions
of the A′α helix lead to an attenuated structural change
of Jα. These results are different from shorter constructs,
indicating that the conformational changes in full-length phototropin
LOV domains might not be as large as previously assumed, and that
the well-characterized full unfolding of the Jα helix in AsLOV2
with short A′α helices may be considered a truncation
artifact. It also suggests that the N- and C-terminal helices of phot-LOV2
domains are necessary for allosteric regulation of the phototropin
kinase domain and may provide a basis for signal integration of LOV1
and LOV2 domains in phototropins.

Introduction
Many organisms
depend on light for energy and tracking sunlight
and have thus evolved light-sensitive proteins and signaling pathways.
In algae and plants, Per-Arnt-Sim (PAS)-containing phototropins respond
to light by activating signaling cascades that end in phototropism
or chloroplast rearrangement.1,2 Phototropins are large
proteins which contain a photoactivatable domain attached to a kinase
domain.1 They utilize a subclass of PAS
domains termed the light-oxygen-voltage (LOV) domain that is activated
by blue light.3−5 LOV
domain activation occurs when the noncovalently bound flavin mononucleotide
(FMN) or flavin adenine dinucleotide chromophore absorbs a photon
that excites the chromophore into a singlet state. This state is converted
into a triplet excited state with high probability,6−8 promoted by
the heavy atom effect of the
cysteine sulfur nucleus.6,9,10 The flavin forms a metastable covalent bond between its C4a atom
and the sulfur of the neighboring cysteine predominantly from the
triplet excited state11−13 and,
in some cases, from the singlet excited state.13,14 During
this process, the N5 atom of the flavin is protonated and reduced,
receiving a donated hydrogen from the active site cysteine.8,15−18 This cysteinyl–flavin adduct spontaneously
decays in seconds–hours depending on solvent accessibility,
steric interactions, and the local electrostatics.19−23

Photon absorption by the flavin and the ensuing
chemical reactions cause the major light-induced conformational changes
in LOV proteins. The amino and carboxy termini of LOV domains are
hotspots for structural rearrangement. The Avena sativa phototropin 1 LOV2 (AsLOV2) domain is a model protein
used to study LOV function and allostery. Light absorption and adduct
formation result in the unfolding of the amino-terminal A′α
helix and the carboxy-terminal Jα helix.24−27 The latter
process occurs in multiple steps: the Jα helix partly unfolds
concomitant with adduct formation in microseconds, after which full
unfolding ensues in hundreds of microseconds.28,29Figure 1 (green)
shows the
X-ray structure of AsLOV2, with the A′α helix and the
Jα helix highlighted.30 These helices
have also been shown to be involved in activation of the attached
kinase domain in the full-length phototropins.31,32 However,
the extent of the conformational changes is not fully known as NMR
and circular dichroism indicates that the effects extend beyond these
two helices.24,25 It is also unknown on the atomic
level how light activation causes conformational change in AsLOV2 and other LOV domains. In the LOV-protein vivid,
a rotation of a highly conserved glutamine residue near the chromophore
is suggested to induce a bulge in the Aβ strand that unfolds
the amino-terminal region.33 A substitution
of the glutamine in AsLOV2 affects the light-activated
conformational change but may not entirely abolish it.25,34,35 Studies indicate that the Hβ
and Iβ strands also play a role in LOV domain conformational
change.25,27,34−38

X-ray structures of AsLOV230 (green) and
AtLOV2 (cyan).43

LOV domains appear to undergo
a similar conformational change but the mechanism appears to be context
dependent, being affected by the flanking input and output domains.39,40 For phototropin-based LOV domains such as AsLOV2,
this context dependence is problematic because little is known structurally
about how they interact with the amino-terminal LOV1 domain or the
carboxy-terminal kinase domain. Small-angle X-ray scattering has provided
a low-resolution structure that indicates that the LOV2 domain is
positioned near the kinase domain.41,42 However, the
participation in phototropin activation remains unclear for the 50
residues that connect the AsLOV2 domain to its kinase
domain. Likewise, little is known about the conformation and functional
role of the hinge—LOV2 A′α region that links LOV2
to LOV1. The crystal structure of Arabidopsis thaliana LOV2 resolved a larger number of amino acids at the N-terminus as
compared to the AsLOV2 structure, and showed that these A′α
extensions adopt a helical conformation and form a dimerization interface,43 as shown in Figure 1 (cyan structure) where the AtLOV2 and AsLOV2
are overlapped. These regions of LOV domains have disparate sequences
so it is unknown how these extended segments are affected by light
activation and whether they undergo similar conformational changes
in some or all LOV domains.

In an effort to better understand
the biophysical mechanisms of how longer AsLOV2 domain
constructs respond to light and activate phosphorylation in the downstream
kinase domain, we created a number of AsLOV2 constructs
that include truncations and additions with progressively longer LOV2
domains. We characterized their light-activated conformational changes
using UV–vis and Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy.
Compared to the more frequently used constructs with short A′α
helices, the constructs with longer A′α helices have
different biophysical characteristics. The longer helix constructs
have photocycle times that are approximately half that of the other
constructs, possibly because of slight conformational shifts around
the chromophore. We find that increasing the length of the amino terminus
of AsLOV2 dampens the amount of light-activated conformational
change as compared to the construct that is commonly used to study
phototropins and for optogenetic engineering (AsLOV2
phot1 404–560). These findings emphasize that the effects of
light on the LOV domain structure are context dependent, and hence,
inferring the behavior of LOV domains in their biological context
from the results on isolated domains should be done with caution.

Results
and Discussion
Recent
work has begun to show the importance of interactions between two
terminal helices in the LOV2 proteins.25,44 The phot1 AsLOV2 domain boundaries have commonly been demarcated at
the start of the A′α helix (residue 404), and after the
end of the Jα helix, near residues 545–560.24,30 Many studies of PAS domains have been on similarly truncated versions.45,46 The regions connecting AsLOV2 to the LOV1 and kinase
domain are hypothesized to be mostly unstructured. This inference
is in stark contrast to what is observed in the full-length structure
of the LOV domain containing sensor histidine kinase YF1,47 which contains only very small unstructured
regions between the LOV and the kinase domain. Structures of other
PAS-containing photoactive proteins such as phytochromes also contain
long helical segments emitting from the amino and carboxy termini
of the PAS domains that form long symmetrical interactions with a
homodimerization partner.48,49 The only extended plant
LOV2 domain structure of AtLOV2 shows helical regions
extending from the A′α.43 From
this result, we hypothesized that AsLOV2 also might
contain helical extensions (Figure 2). Secondary structure prediction of the LOV2 region
of the full length A. sativa phot 1
protein has two helical segments in the amino-terminal region that
often have been truncated in constructs used in early studies of the
LOV domain. In our study, taking the 404–560 construct24 as a reference, we extend the A′α
helix in four different constructs: A′α-5 (residues
399–560), A′α-15 (390–560),
A′α-19 (385–560), and A′α-26 (378–560). The two longest constructs, A′α-19 and A′α-26 did not
express well
enough to be characterized. We also created AsLOV2 constructs that
lacked the Jα helix (ΔJα, residues 404–524)
or the A′α helix (ΔA′α, residues 409–560).
Finally, we also created the 404–550 construct, which is similar
to that used for the AsLOV2-Jα X-ray structure.30

Structural Effects on the Stability
of the Photoadduct
The time constant (τFMN) of the reversible photocycle of AsLOV2 can be
measured by tracking the recovery of the absorbance of the FMN chromophore
at ∼450 nm. The photocycle process is controlled by interactions
of protein’s side chains with the chromophore, water molecules,
or small bases.20,22,23,51−53 The generally used AsLOV2(404–560)
construct has a photocycle τFMN of ∼80 ±
2 s at 293 K. All constructs tested that involved alterations of the
A′α helix, including extension and truncations, speed
up the photocycle (Table 1). Truncations of the Jα helix, however, do not have
a measurable effect on photocycle time, except for truncations of
the Jα helix in the A′α helix extension background.
The majority of mutations that have been made to AsLOV221,25,53 has caused
a slowing in the photocycle. Increasing the photocycle time was shown
to be controlled by the solvent accessibility of the FMN,19 steric effects23 or
the presence of small bases.20 These data
are indicative of interactions between the protein and the chromophore
being affected by the A′α helix and to a lesser extent
by the Jα helix.

N-Terminal
Helix A′α Modulates the Structural Response of the C-Terminal
Jα Helix
To look more closely at what specific helical
structures are being controlled by the extended A′α helix
during light-activated conformational change, we performed FTIR difference
spectroscopy on the different constructs. In light–dark difference
spectra of phototropin LOV domains, undocking and unfolding of the
Jα helix is typically observed as a large negative feature at
around 1645 cm–1 (Figure 3A).26−28 The signal and thus the photo-induced
structural response of this
part of the protein is sensitive to temperature and the hydration
status of the protein.26

Figure 3 FTIR difference
spectra of AsLOV2. Light-minus-dark difference spectra
of the (A) wild type and
(B) wild type and several N-/C-terminal extension/deletion constructs.
The largest difference signal between 1750 and 1000 cm–1 is found at around 1645 cm–1 and is attributed
to undocking and unfolding of the C-terminal Jα helix, which
is significantly influenced by N-/C-terminal extensions and deletions.

In the 404–560
construct, the light-activated conformational change of the Jα
helix is readily observed at 1645 cm–1 where the
difference signal has the largest amplitude (Figure 3A,B black). At low temperatures26 and upon deletion of the Jα helix, this
signal is lost (Figure 3B, red). Furthermore, when we delete the A′α helix,
we also see a loss of the Jα response to light (Figure 3B, orange). This observation
is consistent with the notion that upon deletion of the A′α
helix, the Jα helix is constitutively unfolded in the dark25 and hence will not give a signal upon illumination.
Thus, the A′α helix is crucial for locking the Jα
helix in its dark state and for inducing its undocking in the light
state. In AsLOV2 that contain N-terminal extensions (A′α-5 and A′α-15), the Jα
response
is significantly reduced with the longer extension, A′α-15, having the greater effect (Figure 3B, magenta and cyan). These observations
substantiate the crucial role of A′α in mediating a light-induced
structural response in phot-LOV2 domains, as previously shown.25

Helical change is a common theme in the
function of PAS and LOV domain containing photoregulatory proteins.24,25,33,39,54 Of the LOV domains that have been studied
extensively, most have an amino and/or carboxy terminal helix that
regulates the function of the protein. Here we have shown that the
increased length of the A′α helix decreases the amount
of conformational change, specifically in the Jα helix, that
was previously seen in shorter A′α helix LOV domain constructs.26,27 Our results are consistent with those reported for Chlamydomonas phototropin and LOV1-LOV2 tandem constructs,55 where Jα unfolding signals were observed
with significantly smaller amplitude (4–5 fold less) than in
the short A′α helix LOV domain constructs reported here
and in ref (26). Also,
in the LovK LOV-histidine kinase photoreceptor from Caulobacter crescentus, little loss of helical structure
was observed upon photoactivation.40,56 These observations
strongly suggest that the full Jα helical unfolding that was
so convincingly observed in the short A′α helix LOV domain
constructs,24,26 is highly attenuated in the full-length
LOV-based photoreceptors, and in essence may be regarded as an N-terminal
truncation artifact. Interestingly, it is this nonnative photoinduced
C-terminal helical unfolding that has enabled the widely successful
application of AsLOV2 domain as an optogenetic engineering platform.57−62 The present
results further provide an avenue to modulate the extent of AsLOV2
C-terminal structural change in engineered LOV2-based photoswitches
by modifying the length of the A′a helix.

In the AtLOV2 structure with the extended A′α helix19 both the N and C termini are facing the same
direction, making it likely that the parts of the phototropin structure
usually termed “linker regions” could in fact be helical
segments. Such structural arrangement is seen in many PAS domain-containing
photoreceptors including phytochromes48 and sensor histidine kinases.22 The N-terminal
extensions in the A′α helix, which embed the LOV2 domain
in a more native-like phototropin environment, apparently modulate
the extent of the structural response in the Jα helix. This
process might be used in phototropins to integrate the photoresponses
of both LOV1 and LOV2 domains and also to transmit the signal to the
downstream kinase domain. Analogous scenarios have been discussed
for tandem-PAS domain proteins, for example, phytochrome photoreceptors
or chemical sensors such as FixL, which form coiled coil connectors
between their sensory domains.39 The molecular
arrangement may be different in phototropins and should be elucidated
in further structural studies on full-length proteins. It is, however,
known that discrete mutations in the A′α helix and its
N-terminal extension greatly influence the light-activation of the
kinase domain in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii phot.32 Overall, it is clear that extended
helices from A. sativa phot1 LOV2 play
a key role in the function of the protein.

Materials and Methods
Cloning,
Expression, and Purification
A clone of A.
sativa phot1 LOV2(404–560) with a His6-Gβ1 fusion was used.24 Mutations
were made using the quickchange site-directed mutagenesis strategy
to add or delete residues. All proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells at 37 °C to
an OD 600 nm of 0.6. Cultures were incubated for ∼1 h at 18
°C and induced with 1 mM IPTG, then incubated at 18 °C overnight,
pelleted, and frozen. Frozen pellets were resuspended in 50 mM Tris
100 mM NaCl and 0.01% sodium dodecyl sulfate, and cells were lysed
using sonication and clarified with centrifugation at 10 000g for 45 min. The proteins were purified using metal affinity
chromatography and exchanged into 50 mM Tris, 1 mM EDTA, and 5 mM
DTT at pH 8.0. The His6-Gβ1 tag was removed by incubating
overnight at 20 °C with His6-TEV protease. Metal affinity
chromatography was used to remove His6-Gβ1 and His6-TEV protease from the solution. The final protein contains
residues GEF on the amino terminus and G on the carboxy terminus as
cloning artifacts. Proteins were run on a Sephadex S100 size exclusion
column (GE Healthcare). Protein purity was assayed by comparing the
absorbance ratio at 280 and 447 nm. If this ratio differed significantly
from ∼2.6 to 2.9, the proteins were further purified using
anion exchange chromatography.

UV–Vis
Spectroscopy
UV–vis spectra were acquired using Olis
HP 8452 Diode Array (Bogart, GA) with a 1 cm pathlength cuvette at
22 °C. Kinetic traces were acquired after saturating illumination.
Time-resolved spectra were taken every 1–3 s depending on the
recovery rate at the FMN central peak maximum, usually 448 nm, until
complete recovery of the signal was achieved.

FTIR Experiments
FTIR experiments were performed with
Bruker IFS 66s as previously described.26 Samples were concentrated to an absorbance of 50–70 units
per cm and sandwiched between two CaF2 wafers without spacer.
Care was taken to avoid drying of the samples. The sample cell was
additionally sealed with silicon grease. Light-minus-dark FTIR difference
spectra were recorded between 1800 and 1100 cm–1 by illuminating the sample using an LED light source (Luxeon 1 W
460 nm, effective intensity 20 mW/cm2). For each light-minus-dark
spectrum, 100 scans of background and 100 scans under illumination
were recorded. Ten such difference spectra were averaged for the final
spectra displayed here. The FTIR spectra were normalized on the positive
FMN C4=O band near 1730 cm–1 that is associated
with covalent adduct formation and cleanly separated from other vibrational
signals.63
