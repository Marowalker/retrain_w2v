This study is an
experimental investigation of using biocarbon
as renewable carbonaceous filler for engineering-plastic-based blends.
Poly(trimethylene terephthalate) (PTT) and poly(lactic acid) (PLA)
combined with a terpolymer
were selected as the blend matrix. Biocarbon with various particle
size ranges was segregated and used as filler. Depending on the particle
size and aspect ratio of the biocarbon used, the microstructure of
the composite was found to change. Composites having a biocarbon particle
size range of 20–75 μm resulted in a morphology showing
better dispersion of the blend components when compared with composites
containing other biocarbon particle size ranges. Furthermore,
the addition of epoxy-based multifunctional chain extender was found
to result in much finer morphologies having dispersed polymer particles
of very small size. Impact strength increased significantly in composites
that possessed such morphologies favoring high energy dissipation
mechanisms. A maximum notched Izod impact strength of 85 J/m was achieved
in certain composite formulations, which is impressive considering
the inherent brittleness of PTT and PLA. From rheological observations,
incorporation of biocarbon increased viscosity, but the shear-thinning
behavior of the matrix was preserved. By increasing the injection
mold temperature, fast crystallization of PTT was achieved, which
increased the heat deflection temperature of composites to 80 °C.
This study shows that composites with overall improvement in mechanical
and thermal performance can be produced by selecting biocarbon with
appropriate particle sizes and suitable processing aids and conditions,
which all together control the morphology and crystallinity.

Introduction
Warming of the planet
is unequivocal. Leading scientific organizations
worldwide endorse that climate change is real; related resources can
be found on NASA’s Web page on global climate change.1 Intensive research and development efforts are
therefore focused on using carbon strategically, without emitting
more greenhouse gases and causing extensive environmental damage.
Biochar is a solid material obtained from thermochemical conversion
of biomass in an oxygen-limited environment.2 Research findings on biochar (i.e., biocarbon) and their practical
implementation are increasing exponentially. The carbon contained
in the biomass, taken from the atmosphere in the form of CO2 during plant growth, is stored for a long period of time in biochar,
making it an excellent source for carbon sequestration. Although biochar
was initially designated for use in soil amendments, it is being applied
in a cascade of areas now including water treatment, animal farming,
construction, and composite materials.3 The term biocarbon has been introduced to emphasize
its application as filler or a reinforcing agent in composites, distinguishing
it from carbon black.

Biocarbon has a relatively high surface
area and carbon content
(50%–80%) and is hydrophobic when compared with natural fibers,
which makes it a desirable filler for composites.4 Biocarbon can also act as a reinforcement based on its
aspect ratio, strength, and stiffness. It offers a wide processing
window for blending with engineering plastics, unlike most other natural
fibers that degrade above 200 °C. The thermal stability of the
resulting composites is higher when compared with that of the composites
with natural fibers, for example, polypropylene (PP)/jute fiber, PP/wood
fiber, and PLA/flax fiber composites. Issues related to the unpleasant
odor associated with lignocellulosic natural fibers are greatly minimized
while using biocarbon because it contains very little lignocellulosic
components that usually give rise to the undesirable odor. Similar
to carbon black, a widely used petroleum-based colorant, biocarbon
can also act as a colorant in materials targeted for automotive and
electronic applications. With all of these favorable and functional
attributes, biocarbon-based composites can provide significant opportunities
for weight saving, strength, and versatility in automotive interior
parts. This will allow automakers to meet stringent fuel standards
without sacrificing the performance, quality, and safety. However,
only limited research has been conducted in promoting biocarbon-based
composites for such applications. Peterson et al.5−7 and Jong et
al.8 investigated biocarbon from different
sources with varying carbon content and particle size as a potential
replacement for carbon black in styrene butadiene rubber and natural
rubber. Characterization of biocarbon from different sources9 and surface treatment10 have been carried out to promote the use of biocarbon for composite
applications. Polytrimethylene terephthalate (PTT),11,12 nylon,13,14 epoxy,15 polyvinyl
alcohol (PVA),16 and PP17 are some of the matrices in which the effect of biocarbon
has been investigated. Recently, Das et al.18−20 have published
a series of research articles on using biocarbon in combination with
wood flour to develop “wood plastic biochar composites”.
Although the original driving force for adding fillers to polymers
was to reduce the overall cost of the final formulations, fillers
also modify certain properties of the matrix favorably. All of the
above published literature agrees with the stiffening effect of biocarbon.
Key understanding underpinning
the information is that these publications show the importance of
carbon content, particle size, pyrolysis temperature, and surface
area in enhancing the performance of the biocarbon composites.

The aim of the current study was to investigate the effect of size-fractionated
biocarbon on the resulting morphology and macroscopic properties of
the composites, which would enable the selection of biocarbon with
appropriate sizes and aspect ratio for target applications. A PTT–PLA
blend moderately toughened with ethylene methyl acrylate glycidyl
methacrylate (EMAGMA) was selected as the matrix material. PTT is
a semi-crystalline polymer produced from the condensation of propylene
diol (PDO) with terephthalic acid or dimethyl terephthalate, joining
the PET (polyethylene terephthalate) and PBT (polybutylene terephthalate)
family of polyesters. PLA remains one of the most widely researched
biopolymers and is increasingly seen blended with other durable engineering
polymers to widen their application areas. However, both PTT and PLA
have poor impact resistance; hence, they are blended with EMAGMA to
improve their impact strength. On the basis of the statistical optimization
of the blending process performed in our previous study,21 PTT–PLA/EMAGMA (85/15) blend was selected
as the matrix. The ratio of PTT/PLA was kept constant at 70:30 wt
%. Our previous investigation21 also showed
that only the impact strength was significantly affected in the presence
of chain extender, owing to the changes in blend morphology. As one
of the aims of the current study was to investigate the effect of
chain extender on the composite system, blends without chain extender
were considered for baseline comparison. By adding biocarbon to the
PTT–PLA/EMAGMA matrix, cost-effective composite formulations
can be developed if favorable properties are obtained. The cost of
biocarbon is expected to be significantly cheaper than that of the
matrix system but varies based on the raw material used for its production.
For example, if the biocarbon is produced from baled miscanthus, as
in this study, the cost would depend on the cost of miscanthus and
the biocarbon production cost. If the biocarbon is produced from a
coproduct, which currently does not have any market value, then the
cost will include only the cost associated with the production process
(thermal conversion) and hence will be significantly much cheaper.
As both PTT and PLA have low impact strength and heat resistance,
the goal of this study was to develop a formulation that will show
improvement in the above-mentioned properties, relative to the neat
polymers and with cost advantages. Because of the general tendency
of fillers to reduce the impact strength at a higher filler content,
the preliminary investigation reported here was conducted by adding
only 10 wt % biocarbon. The effect of different size-fractionated
biocarbon particles obtained through mechanical sieving was investigated
by studying the microstructure, mechanical, thermal, and rheological
properties. The effect of adding a chain extender and increasing the
mold temperature was also investigated. Final properties of the composites
are critically dependent on the size, shape, and aspect ratio of the
particles themselves. Therefore, particle size distributions through
image analysis for different size-fractionated biocarbon particles
were also analyzed.

Experimental Section
Materials
PTT
available under the trade name Sorona
3301 BK 001 was kindly supplied by DuPont (Wilmington, DE, USA). This
grade of Sorona used contains 35 wt % of the renewable resource content
derived from corn. NatureWorks Ingeo PLA 3001D with 1.5% d-lactide content was supplied by NatureWorks LLC (Minnetonka, MN,
USA). Lotader AX 8900 (EMAGMA) product of Arkema (Colombes, France)
was purchased from Quadra Chemicals, Canada. Epoxy-functionalized
chain extender (CE) used in this study was Joncryl ADR-4368, a product
of BASF (Ludwigshafen, Germany). Miscanthus-based biocarbon (BC) hammer
milled to ∼400 μm (1/64 in.) was received from Competitive
Green Technologies, Leamington, ON, Canada. This biocarbon was produced
through a low-temperature pyrolysis process, as the functionalities
are noticed to be still present in the FTIR spectra, as shown in the Supporting Information. Before processing, a
12 h drying protocol for PTT at 105 °C, for PLA at 80 °C,
and for EMAGMA at 60 °C was followed. The moisture content of
the polymers before processing was measured to be 0.045 ± 0.007%.
The moisture content of the biocarbon stored in the oven at 105 °C
was measured to be 1.6 ± 0.15%.

Size-Fractionation of Biocarbon
Size-fractionation
of biocarbon was performed using a nest of WS Tyler test sieves having
openings of 300, 212, 150, 125, 75, and 20 μm. The coarse and
fine sieves were assembled on a Ro-tap sieve shaker (WS Tyler, OH,
USA) and agitated for 10 min. Schematic of the sieve setup is shown
in Figure 1 along with
the particle size range selected for this study.

Figure 1 Schematic of the sieve
setup on a Ro-Tap sieve shaker.

After the sieving was complete, the mass retained over different
sieves was collected, weighed, and analyzed. Percentage of mass retained
on each sieve was calculated from three replications of sieving. To
obtain a substantial amount of biocarbon below 20 μm, “as-received”,
biocarbon was further subjected to ball milling for 3 h at 300 rpm.
Planetary ball mill (Retsch GmbH, Haan, Germany) was used for size
reduction. The stainless steel grinding jar was charged with 40 g
of biocarbon, and the milling media contained 64 small zirconium oxide
balls of diameter 10 mm and 1 stainless steel ball of diameter 40
mm. The milled biocarbon was then sieved using the Retsch air jet
sieving machine AS 200 to obtain biocarbon primarily below 20 μm.
Sieving time and speed were set to 1 min and 30 rpm, respectively.

Biocomposite Fabrication
Biocomposites were fabricated
in a microcompounder (DSM Xplore, the Netherlands) by adding all of
the blend components and size-fractionated biocarbon of required composition
in a one-step process. The length and the L/D ratio of the screws
were 150 and 18 mm, respectively. The barrel volume of the machine
was 15 cm3. Extrusion was performed at 250 °C barrel
temperature and 200 rpm screw speed. After a total residence time
of 2 min, a preheated collector with a piston cylinder assembly was
used to transfer the molten extrudate into a DSM micro 12 cc injection
molding machine, without pelletization. The injection pressure for
injection and holding stages was set at 4 and 8 bar, respectively;
the total injection time was 18 s. Samples were molded at 30 °C
mold temperature. For selected biocomposites, samples were also molded
at 60 and 90 °C. The injection time was increased to 60 s to
facilitate cooling and easy sample removal without distortion when
a high mold temperature was used. The effect of chain extender and
mold temperature was investigated only in composites with 20–75
μm BC and less than 20 μm BC for concise presentation
of the experimental results. Mold temperatures of 30, 60, and 90 °C
were adopted for 20–75 μm BC composites. On the basis
of the initial assessment of the mechanical properties and heat resistance
of these composites, only 30 and 90 °C were selected to investigate
BC composites less than 20 μm. To show the effect of chain extender
(CE) in combination with the mold temperature, the CE was added to
20–75 μm BC composites molded at 30 and 90 °C. For
comparison, the properties of less than 20 μm BC composites
containing CE molded only at 90 °C are provided.

Testing and
Characterization
Morphology and Particle Size Measurement
The morphology
of individual biocarbon particles and fractured surface was observed
using the scanning electron microscope Phenom ProX (Phenom World BV,
the Netherlands) equipped with a back scattering electron (BSE). Cressington
sputter coater 108 was used to gold-coat the composite samples for
15 s under an argon atmosphere. Selected composites were etched in
chloroform for 30 min at 50°C to remove the PLA and EMAGMA phase.
ImageJ, a public domain image processing and analysis program developed
by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), USA, was used to measure
the particle size of biocarbon. Around 300 particles were measured
in the longest and the shortest dimensions for biocarbon above 75
μm. For 20–75 μm BC and less than 20 μm BC,
around 1000 particles were measured for the longest dimension.

Mechanical
Properties and Rheology
Mechanical properties
were measured after the test specimens were conditioned in the standard
laboratory atmosphere for 48 h at 23 °C and 50% relative humidity
(ASTMD618-08, procedure A). Instron Instrument Model 3382 was used
to study the tensile and flexural properties of the biocomposites.
ASTM standard D638 with type IV sample was followed for the tensile
test. The flexural test was performed following the ASTM D790 procedure
B. The tensile properties of biocomposites were tested at 5 mm/min.
The flexural specimens were tested at a crosshead speed of 14 mm/min.
Notched Izod impact strength was measured with the help of Testing
Machine Inc. (TMI) instrument, according to ASTM D256. At least six
notched samples were measured for impact strength and five samples
for tensile and flexural properties. Average values with standard
deviations are reported.

Rheological characterization was conducted
using an Anton Paar MCR302 rheometer (Anton Paar GmbH, Graz, Austria)
using a parallel plate configuration. The plate diameter used was
25 mm, with a measurement gap distance set at 1 mm. The shear rate
was varied between 0.01 and 1000/s. The test was conducted at 250
°C under a nitrogen purge.

Differential Scanning Calorimetry
(DSC)
DSC was performed
by heating the samples to 240 °C with a heating rate of 10 °C/min,
followed by a 3 min isothermal step to erase the thermal history,
and then cooled to −50 °C with a cooling rate of 5 °C/min.
The same heating profile was used for the second heating scan as well.
Glass transition temperature (Tg), cold
crystallization temperature (Tcc), crystallization
temperature (Tc), and melting temperature
(Tm) were determined from the DSC graphs.
Percentage crystallinity (χc) was calculated using
the equation  whereΔHm is the enthalpy of melting, ΔHcc is enthalpy of cold crystallization, and
ΔHm0 is the enthalpy
of melting of 100% pure PTT, 145.5 J/g.22f is the weight fraction of PLA in the blend. Results
reported are the average values of at least two samples.

Dynamic Mechanical
Analysis (DMA)
DMA was conducted
on DMA Q800 from TA Instruments using a dual-cantilever clamp in a
frequency sweep/temperature ramp mode at the frequency of 1 Hz and
oscillating amplitude of 15 μm. The samples (dimensions 12.7
× 63.5 × 3.2 mm3) were heated from −50
to 120 °C at a heating rate of 3 °C/min. Heat deflection
temperature (HDT) was also measured using DMA Q 800 with a three-point
bending clamp in the DMA controlled force mode at a stress of 0.455
MPa and a ramp rate of 2 °C/min.11,13 Deflection
was evaluated at 0.1889% strain.

Results and Discussion
Particle
Size Analysis and Shape Classification
Particle
size distribution (PSD) from the sieve shaker provides the percentage
of particles retained on different-sized sieves as shown in Figure 2. A maximum weight
percentage distribution was achieved in the range of 20–75
μm. Hammer mill is known to break down the biomass or in this
case biocarbon because of the action of shear and friction. Milling
screen size, motor speed, and material feeding method are mentioned
to be key variables determining the resulting particle size and particle
size distribution.23 As seen from Figure 2, this kind of distribution
provides a broad range of particle size based on the selected sieve.
Therefore, particle sizes in the longest and the shortest dimensions
within each of these ranges were measured from SEM images.

Figure 2 Particle size
distribution based on the mass retained in the sieves.

In addition to providing relatively precise particle
size distribution,
SEM can also provide useful information regarding the shape of the
particles. Representative SEM images used for the analysis are shown
in Figure 3. Particle
size distribution is presented in Figures 4 and 5. Size-fractionated
biocarbons are differentiated based on the sieve openings.

Figure 4 Particle size distribution along the longest and the shortest
dimensions
for size-fractionated BC.

Figure 5 Particle size distribution along the longest dimension for 20–75
and <20 μm BC.

The shape of the biocarbon in the first four particle size
ranges
above 75 μm resembles the structure of chopped miscanthus fibers
from which the biocarbon was pyrolyzed. On the basis of the ASTM standard
F1877-05 (appendix ×2),24 they could
be classified under “sharps or shards—rectangular fibers”.
Particles of biocarbon in the 20–75 μm range have sharp
edges and can be called “sharps or shards—cuttlefish”.
The shape of the particles less than 20 μm can be described
to be a mixture of “granular, irregular—smooth and angulated”.
Broad particle size distribution can be observed for particle length
(the longest dimension) when compared with particle width (the shortest
dimension) distribution histograms shown in Figure 4. This can be explained based on the characteristics
of mechanical sieving. In general, the sieving process is described
as a width-based separation process, where the particles having width
higher than the sieve-opening size cannot pass through in any given
orientation.25 However, when the sieves
are under tapping motion, longer particles can “fall-through”
or “nose-dive” into smaller sieve openings.25 This tipping action results in larger inconsistencies
in length-based separation processes, which is reflected as a broad
distribution when the particle length is measured. Particles having
dimensions much higher than the maximum sieve opening can be observed
from Figure 4. However,
as the sieve-opening size reduces, the distribution becomes narrower.
Although majority of the particle width is within the sieve-opening
range, the presence of smaller particles cannot be avoided as they
tend to agglomerate and cling to one another during sieving. Only
length-based particle size distribution is provided for 20–75
μm and less than 20 μm sieve in Figure 5 because of the difficulty in measuring the
width for the particles laying edge-wise showing thickness, the third
dimension. Also, as the particle size reduces,
the length of the granular-shaped particles coincides with their width.
Majority of the BC belonging to the 20–75 μm sieve range
has a particle length of less than 75 μm.

The size-fractionation
process through mechanical sieving resulted
in lesser amounts of biocarbon below 20 μm (Figure 2); therefore, to obtain a substantial
amount of biocarbon in this range to fabricate composites, “as-received”
biocarbon was subjected to the ball-milling process (conditions described
in the Experimental Section). The milled biocarbon
was sieved to below 20 μm without fractionation in an air jet
sieve. Majority of the BC particles were smaller than 2 μm,
indicating that the ball milling process has resulted in greater size
reduction. This also explains the shape of these particles being quite
different from other biocarbon particles of higher sieve-opening ranges.
Such differences in shapes, sizes, and hence, the aspect ratio of
the biocarbon are expected to have a significant effect on the matrix,
resulting in different morphologies and macroscopic properties.

Morphology
Impact-fractured surface morphology of composites
containing different size-fractionated biocarbon particles is shown
in Figures 6 and 7. Biocarbon particles are randomly oriented in planes
parallel to the surface and are visibly well-distributed over the
entire section of the matrix for composites shown in Figure 6. Morphology of the matrix
in composites with biocarbon above 125 μm does not show any
phase-separated blend components, PLA and EMAGMA. With reduction in
BC particle size to less than 125 μm, roughly spherical domains
of dispersed PLA–EMAGMA are noticed, where the blend retains
its sea-island morphology. This morphology is predominant in composites
with 75–125 and 20–75 μm ranges and can be viewed
from the higher magnification section. For composites with less than
20 μm BC, the morphology changes again from a sea-island structure
to a morphology with elongated bands of coalesced PLA–EMAGMA
as shown in Figure 7. To clearly present the change in composite microstructure, the
fractured surfaces were etched in chloroform at 50 °C for 30
min. Chloroform etched both PLA and EMAGMA phases, leaving the PTT
phase intact. In Figure 7c,d, etched images of these composites are presented in a lower magnification
when compared with images in Figure 7a,b to show the distinct difference.

with different size-fractionated biocarbon
(the arrows point to biocarbon particles).

<20 μm BC; (c) 20–75 μm BC after etching; (d)
<20 μm BC after etching; (e) 20–75 μm BC and
0.5 phr CE; and (f) <20 μm BC and 0.5 phr CE.

The flow-induced microstructure changes continuously
because of
a complex interplay between breakup and coalescence. In composites
with less than 20 μm biocarbon, the bands are made of coalesced
PLA and EMAGMA particles. This difference in morphology could be attributed
to the change in (i) viscosity, (ii) biocarbon particle shape with
milling and associated changes in packing fractions, or (iii) free
energy of mixing, which alters the interaction and interfacial tension
between the blend components. These results demonstrate that the morphology
of the composites is contingent not only on the particle size and
distribution but also on the particle shape and viscosity.

The
effect of chain extender was assessed only in composites with
20–75 μm BC and less than 20 μm BC for simple comparison.
On addition of CE to these composites, the morphology changed again;
the dispersed domain sizes were further reduced to very small size,
most likely because of the change in viscosity and interfacial tension
between the dispersed blend components. The epoxy-based chain extender
has been effective in breaking down the PLA phase to very small particles
in both the composite formulations. The addition of CE was able to
promote droplet breakup and overcome the effect of coalescence observed
in less than 20 μm biocarbon composites. The fine dispersion
of the particles in the matrix helps in increasing the toughness because
the interparticle distance or the ligament thickness is reduced, facilitating
yielding of the matrix.26 Because the matrix
used is a ternary blend system, it is important to control the blend
inclusion size to achieve the desired morphologies, which will decide
the majority of macroscopic properties. The effect of colloidal particles
on stabilizing the morphology of emulsions has been an intense field
of investigation for more than a century. Immiscible polymer blends
are like highly viscous emulsions. Addition of nanofillers has been
found to suppress the coarsening process and to stabilize the cocontinuous
structure of the blends through accumulation at the interface. On
the basis of this strategy, many nanofillers including carbon black
have been used to stabilize the cocontinuous morphology.27,28 Lipatov et al.29 proposed that fillers
can stabilize the blend morphology by adsorbing either of the blending
polymers on their surface. In order for this interfacial stabilization
to occur, the inorganic fillers should have highest surface area and
should be dispersed very well in the blend. On the basis of our morphological
observations, biocarbon with less than 20 μm is expected to
have a high surface area when compared with other particle size ranges,
which could help in suppressing the breakup of polymer particles.
However, the addition of chain extender overpowers this suppression
effect and facilitates very fine dispersion of PLA–EMAGMA particles
in the matrix.

Mechanical Properties and HDT
Mechanical
properties
and HDT data for the PTT–PLA/EMAGMA blend (control) and the
various biocarbon composites are presented in Figures 8 and 9. Baseline data
for PTT/PLA (70/30) blend can be found in our previous study.21 Incorporation of particulate fillers can modify
the mechanical properties of polymers in many ways depending on the
particle size, loading, particle–matrix interfacial adhesion,
and the microstructure of the composites.30 The maximum strength sustained by microparticulate composites under
uniaxial tensile loading depends on the effective stress transfer
between the matrix and filler particles. The biocarbon composites
studied in this study did not show drastic improvements in tensile
strength as the particle size range reduced; the results are shown
in Figure 8. However,
a slightly increasing trend is observed but with the values still
being lower than the matrix strength. With the addition of CE and
because of the high molding temperature (90 °C), the tensile
strength of the composite is close to that of the blend processed
at 30 °C. In addition to the chain extension effect, Joncryl
has been reported to increase the viscosity and reduce the interfacial
tension between the blending components, thus reducing the size of
the dispersed phase, in this case PLA and EMAGMA. From morphological
examinations discussed in the previous section, reduction in the dispersed
phase size was found to be true for these blends. PLA with reduced
phase size in the PTT blend could act as efficient hard filler particles
having relatively stronger adhesion with the matrix compared with
the biocarbon particles, thereby increasing the stress transfer.

Figure 8 (a) Tensile
and (b) flexural properties of size-fractionated biocarbon
composites, showing the effect of varying size range, mold temperature,
and CE.

Figure 9 Impact strength and HDT for biocarbon composites.

Flexural strength is the ability
of a material to resist deformation
under a combination of compressive and tensile stresses. Hence, values
reported for flexural strength are usually higher than the tensile
strength. From Figure 8b, considering the standard deviation, flexural strength remains
almost the same for the biocomposites. The flexural strength of composites
containing less than 20 μm BC was observed to decrease in comparison
with composites with 20–75 μm BC. This anomalous observation
can be explained with reference to the morphology of the composites
containing less than 20 μm biocarbon. The coalesced bands of
PLA–EMAGMA probably resulted in more flexibility, thus reducing
the overall ability of composites to resist deformation. Prominent
increase in the flexural strength is observed when the mold temperature
is increased from 30 to 60 °C and then to 90 °C in 20–75
μm BC composites. This could be related to the increase in the
crystallinity of PTT, which enhances secondary bonding through closely
packed molecular chains.31

Addition
of 10 wt % biocarbon has increased the tensile and flexural
modulus of the composites. However, the modulus was observed to be
not affected by the difference in the particle size range of biocarbon.
It is not surprising because several studies in the literature have
reported similar observations.32,33 However, there are
some theoretical predictions and experimental proofs that report an
increase in modulus when the particle size is roughly below 30 nm.34,35 On the basis of these observations, there seems to be a critical
particle size beyond which there is no effect on composite modulus.
As observed previously, the particle size of biocarbon is well above
the 30 nm range proposed; hence, the modulus of biocomposites fabricated
in this study is insensitive to the difference in the range of particle
size examined. When the mold temperature was increased to enhance
the crystallization rate of PTT, flexural modulus values increased,
indicating the increase in stiffness of the composites. When CE was
added to composites containing 20–75 and less than 20 μm
BC, initial reduction in modulus, especially in flexural modulus was
observed. When the mold temperature was increased to 90 °C, similar
to the previous observation in composites without CE, the flexural
modulus slightly increased.

For composites, impact strength
is a complex correlation because
of the presence of the orientation and distribution of fillers, the
filler–matrix adhesion, and the resulting morphology. To have
high impact strength or toughness, a large volume of the material
should be able to absorb the energy dissipated. Values of impact strength
observed are usually correlated with the energy dissipation mechanism
preferred by the fracturing surface. Crack initiation and propagation
are important in determining the impact strength of the composites.
The same mechanism of pull-out and debonding, which increases the
impact strength of composites, tends to have a negative effect on
breaking strength. This is sometimes the reason for the inverse relationship
between breaking strength and impact strength. Figure 9 shows the initial reduction in notched Izod
impact strength, indicating the decreased ease of crack initiation
and propagation in the presence of larger biocarbon particles. Impact-fractured
surface morphology revealed a change in morphology as the size of
the biocarbon particles reduced. As the blend components were dispersed
in the matrix, impact strength increased, showing values closer to
the level of the matrix. An impact strength of 70 J/m was achieved
in the case of composites with 75–125 and 20–75 μm
BC. Corroborating with morphological observations, the impact strength
of composites with less than 20 μm biocarbon dropped to 40 J/m.
This again can be attributed to the inability of the coalesced structure
to dissipate much energy or the absence of resistance to crack propagation
and crack pinning effect.

With the addition of CE to composites
containing 20–75 μm
and less than 20 μm biocarbon, the impact strength increased
to 85 J/m. This again could be related to the very fine dispersed
polymer particle morphology observed in the presence of CE, which
favored a high energy dissipating mechanism. When a suitable interparticle
distance between the dispersed polymers is reached, the matrix can
yield easily, thus improving impact strength. Another possible toughening
mechanism is crack pinning. The finely dispersed and well-bonded PLA
particles can facilitate the crack-pinning mechanism by impeding crack
propagation. The crack tends to bow out between particles and forms
secondary cracks that consume extra energy. This toughening mechanism
has been noted in epoxy filled with rigid glass spheres.36

As the crystallization of PTT is promoted
by increasing the mold
temperature, impact strength of the composites containing 20–75
μm BC remained the same. However, in the presence of CE, samples
molded at 90 °C showed reduction in the impact strength. An increase
in crystallinity sometimes negatively affects the impact strength
when the crystallites act as stress concentrators. It causes the stress
acting on a small volume of the material to grow much higher than
the average stress applied to the entire sample.37 It is possible that this behavior is prominent only in
the presence of CE because of the dispersion of PLA–EMAGMA
in very small and fine particles. In addition to the crystalline structure,
the crystalline superstructure that includes the spherulite size,
crystalline form, and percentage crystallinity also influences the
mechanical properties of semicrystalline polymers.38

Figure 9 also shows
the HDT for the matrix and composites with different size-fractionated
biocarbon. Incorporation of fillers is known to increase the HDT of
semicrystalline polymers depending on the type of polymer and its
crystallization rate, type, and the amount of filler loading. It also
depends on processing conditions such as mold temperature that affect
the mechanical behavior and the presence of nucleating agents enhancing
crystallization. HDT is closely related to the flexural modulus of
the filled composite.31 The addition of
different size-fractionated biocarbon has increased the HDT of the
composites by at most 4–7 °C. This temperature is still
very low for any engineering-polymer-based material to be stated as
an upper value of dimensional stability. Therefore, the effect of
mold temperature in increasing the crystallization and HDT was investigated.
The gradual increase in flexural modulus noticed while increasing
the mold temperature from 30 to 90 °C corresponds with the increment
observed in HDT. A highest average HDT of 80 °C was obtained
for composites with 20–75 μm and less than 20 μm
molded at 90 °C. The improvement in HDT values at higher mold
temperatures is attributed to the enhanced stiffness and percentage
of PTT crystallization. The effect of 60 °C mold
temperature on less than 20 μm BC was not studied because results
from the 20–75 μm BC composites showed that the temperature
90 °C provided the highest improvement in the HDT value.

Rheology
Incorporation of solid particulates can critically
alter the flow characteristics, influencing melt processing and the
properties of the final composites.39 Key
factors changing the rheological behavior of composites are filler
size, shape, concentration, and the interactions between filler particles.40 In general, for a composite system, viscosity
increases with filler concentrations and reduction in filler particle
size. Fillers with a smaller particle size facilitate the formation
of filler network or structural skeleton within the polymer matrix,
resulting in a very sharp rise in viscosity at a low shear rate. Defining
yield stress behavior has been reported for nanoparticles forming
such network structures.41 Yield stress
is not observed in polymers filled with larger particles because the
hydrodynamic interaction dominates the response to shear deformation
rather than particle–particle interaction.41 As the material is subjected to higher shear rate, the
filler network structure is destroyed and the effect of filler on
viscosity becomes minimal.42

Figure 10 shows the dependence
of viscosity, η, on log shear rate, γ̇. The PTT
blend matrix exhibits zero shear viscosity plateau, indicating Newtonian
behavior at low shear rates and power-law behavior at higher shear
rates. Upon the addition of size-fractionated biocarbon (up to 75
μm), viscosity of the composites in the limit of Newtonian region
was observed to increase. The highest viscosity was achieved at 20–75
μm range, implying that there is tighter packing between particles
potentially resisting relative motion. Surprisingly, with further
reduction in the particle size, the viscosity of the composites dropped
below the matrix viscosity. It is important to mention that this reduction
in viscosity was reproducible.

Figure 10 Shear rate vs viscosity for size-fractionated
biocarbon composites.

Such conspicuous reduction in viscosity has been reported
previously
for polymer composites with nanoparticles.41 Dilution of the polymer chain entanglement density, selective adsorption
of high-molecular-weight polymer chains on the surface of the particles,
increased excluded free volume induced around the particles, slip
between the sample and the geometry during rheological testing, and
the degradation of the matrix are some of the reasons attributed to
this behavior.41 Smoother particles tend
to exhibit a lower shear viscosity when compared with uneven and sharp
particles. The change in shape of the <20 μm particles because
of milling could also be one possible reason for such reduction in
viscosity. Extended set of experimental results is required to precisely
conclude which of these factors are responsible for the observed reduction
in viscosity of the <20 μm BC composites.

At higher
shear rates, the chains can disentangle, orient, or stretch
themselves parallel to the direction of driving force. Therefore,
in a nonlinear region, the sample is deformed to a point wherein the
molecular structure is destroyed and shear thinning takes place with
a drastic drop in viscosity. In summary, the incorporation of biocarbon
affects the viscosity based on the particle size and shape at low
shear rates, but the basic shear thinning behavior of the polymer
matrix is not affected. The observed increase or decrease in viscosity
of the composites at low shear rates depends on the polymer inclusion
phase present in the matrix and on how they are affected based on
the particle size range of biocarbon.

Thermal Properties
Differential
Scanning Calorimetry (DSC)
The nonisothermal
crystallization behavior of PTT blend and biocomposites was studied
using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) to investigate the effect
of size-fractionation, mold temperature, and chain extender. Table 1shows
the values obtained for glass transition temperature (Tg), melting temperature (Tm) and the corresponding enthalpy (Hm),
cold crystallization temperature (Tcc)
and the corresponding enthalpy (Hcc) from
the first heating cycle, and crystallization temperature (Tc) from the cooling cycle. Tg values of PTT and PLA in biocomposites have increased
slightly with the addition of biocarbon and CE and the increase in
mold temperature when compared with the Tg values of these components in the blend. The addition of size-fractionated
biocarbon and CE and the change in mold temperature have slowed down
the local dynamics of polymer chain, hence the increase in Tg of PTT and PLA in composites. Average melting
temperatures for PTT and PLA remained the same throughout the entire
range of formulations tested.

Although Tcc values of PTT and PLA
remained the same, an interesting trend was observed in the enthalpy
values (Hcc). As the particle size range
of biocarbon decreased, Hcc of PTT increased
and that of PLA decreased. A larger fraction of PTT chains were not
able to crystallize during the molding process as the biocarbon particle
size and the inclusion phase size decreased. However, Tcc of PTT disappeared with increase in mold temperature,
indicating faster and complete crystallization of PTT achieved during
high temperature molding. PLA exhibited its characteristic cold crystallization
temperature at around 100 °C. Increase in this temperature to
∼110 °C indicated a slower crystallization rate in the
presence of chain extender. Increase in mold temperature did not seem
to have any effect on Tcc of PLA. Previously,
we discovered the Tcc of PLA to disappear
only at a mold temperature of 120 °C.43

As expected, the PLA phase did not exhibit melt crystallization
upon cooling because of its very slow crystallization rate. The Tc value of PTT in
certain composite formulations was increased, compared with the value
observed for the blend. Percentage crystallinity calculated for composites
with different size-fractionated biocarbon is observed to decrease
with a decrease in the particle size range. This is expected as the
cold crystallization enthalpy increased. Increase in the mold temperature
for composites with 20–75 μm and <20 μm BC increased
the crystallinity by 20%, and this was directly reflected in the HDT
values. Although composites with BC >150 μm had similar high
values of crystallinity, the HDT values were observed to be low. As
the mold temperature increased, it is possible that the higher fraction
of amorphous chains were arranged closer to the crystalline fraction.
Consequently, this arrangement hinders free movement of the entire
long chain, resists heat-induced distortions, resulting in enhanced
HDT.

Dynamic Mechanical Analysis
Storage modulus (G′) and damping factor (tan δ) for different
size-fractionated biocarbon against temperature are shown in Figure 11. Overlaid storage
modulus and tan δ graphs for 20–75 μm biocarbon
in the presence of CE and at different mold temperatures are shown
in Figure 12. The
first obvious observation is the increase in storage modulus of the
composites compared with that of the blend matrix because of the addition
of biocarbon. All of the composites showed similar values of storage
modulus. A drop in storage modulus in subzero temperatures is characterized
by the transition of EMAGMA phase in the blends and composites. At
the plateau region above 0 °C and below Tg, rapid short range diffusion motions dependent on the chain
entanglement take place. A drastic drop in storage modulus occurs
when the material passes through the Tg values of PTT and PLA, showing an α transition relaxation
peak.

Figure 11 (a) Storage modulus and (b) tan δ graphs for PTT biocomposites
with size-fractionated biocarbon.

Figure 12 Storage modulus and tan δ graphs for PTT biocomposites with
20–75 μm biocarbon.

Beyond 90 °C, transitions assigned to the polymer chain
rearrangement
in the crystalline domain and across the amorphous-crystal interphase
occur. This temperature coincides well with the cold crystallization
temperature observed for PLA using DSC. Composites with 20–75
μm biocarbon containing CE showed reduced storage modulus, with
values less than that of the matrix. As the mold temperature was increased
from 30 to 90 °C, a gradual step increase in storage modulus
was observed corroborating with other test results. The vertical magnitude
of the tan δ peak gives information regarding the damping behavior
of the biocarbon on the motion of polymer chains. Reduction in the
tan δ peak indicates restricted molecular movement due to polymer–particle
interactions. In our case, the peak height was only slightly varied
between different size-fractionated biocarbon, and at less than 20
μm BC, the magnitude of the tan δ peak was higher than
that of the matrix. This particular composite seems to have experienced
higher viscoelastic energy dissipation. Composites with 20–75
μm BC at higher mold temperature showed greater degree of damping
when compared with the ones molded at 30 °C.

Conclusions
In this study, biocomposites were made from PTT 70/PLA 30–EMAGMA
blend (85–15) and 10 wt % biocarbon. Biocarbon between size
ranges of 212–300, 150–212, 125–150, 75–125,
20–75, and <20 μm was fractionated using Tyler sieves
having corresponding sieve-opening size. Important findings from this
study are summarized below. The blend matrix retained its primary
sea-island morphology with roughly spherical domains of the PLA–EMAGMA
dispersed phase in composites with 75–125 and 20–75
μm biocarbon. At larger particle size range, biocarbon offered
hindrance to the dispersion of the blend components during processing.
Further change in the morphology of composites with <20 μm
biocarbon was attributed to the good dispersion of the particles that
could stabilize the blend morphology, showing coalesced PLA–EMAGMA
particles. Addition of chain extender was effective in suppressing
the coalescence and dispersed the PLA–EMAGMA particles in much
smaller and finer morphologies. This morphology was favorable in achieving
a higher impact strength by a combination of yielding and crack-pinning
mechanism. In an attempt to improve the crystallinity of PTT, the
mold temperature was increased. This promoted faster PTT crystallization,
consequently increasing the HDT to around 80 °C in some of the
formulations when the mold temperature was 90 °C. The stiffening
effect achieved with increasing mold temperature was further supported
by the increase in flexural modulus. The viscosity of different polymers
measured from rheological tests supported the morphology and mechanical
properties observed for the biocomposites. In summary, this study
showed that using biocarbon having appropriate size and shape, morphology
of the composites can be controlled and that by increasing the mold
temperature, favorable improvement in crystallinity can be obtained.
In addition to achieving the desired properties, cost reduction involved
in using biocarbon can also contribute to the success of these composites
in finding high performance applications.
