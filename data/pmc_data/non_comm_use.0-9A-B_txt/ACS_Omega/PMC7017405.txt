The
efficient engineering of iminium biocatalysis has drawn considerable
attention, with many applications in pharmaceutical synthesis. Here,
we report a tailor-made iminium-activated colorimetric “turn-on”
probe, specifically designed as a prescreening tool to facilitate
engineering of iminium biocatalysis. Upon complexation of the probe
with the catalytic Pro-1 residue of the model enzyme 4-oxalocrotonate
tautomerase (4-OT), a brightly colored merocyanine-dye-type structure
is formed. 4-OT mutants that formed this brightly colored species
upon incubation with the probe proved to have a substantial activity
for the iminium-based Michael-type addition of nitromethane to cinnamaldehyde,
whereas mutants that showed no staining by the probe exhibited no
or very low-level “Michaelase” activity. This system
was exploited in a solid-phase prescreening assay termed as activated
iminium colony staining (AICS) to enrich libraries for active mutants.
AICS prescreening reduced the screening effort up to 20-fold. After
two rounds of directed evolution, two artificial Michaelases were
identified with up to 39-fold improvement in the activity for the
addition of nitromethane to cinnamaldehyde, yielding the target γ-nitroaldehyde
product with excellent isolated yield (up to 95%) and enantiopurity
(up to >99% ee). The colorimetric activation of the turn-on probe
could be extended to the class I aldolase 2-deoxy-d-ribose
5-phosphate aldolase, implicating a broader application of AICS in
engineering iminium biocatalysis.

Introduction
Iminium-based catalysts
are among the most versatile catalysts,
finding applications in a myriad of C–C bond-forming transformations.1 Many of these transformations lead to the formation
of one or more asymmetric carbon atoms. Hence, researchers have focused
on the discovery and engineering of iminium-based enzymes that could
be applied as biocatalysts.2−4 Unfortunately, nature’s
repertoire of iminium-based carboligases is limited. This has motivated
researchers to supplement natural iminium-based biocatalysts with
artificial biocatalysts, either obtained by computational design5,6 or inspired by natural scaffolds.7,8 Regardless
of the source of the biocatalyst, enzyme engineering is often required
to improve the catalytic rate, enantioselectivity, or stability. In
the Hilvert laboratory, the computationally designed retroaldolase
RA95.0 was engineered toward Michael-type additions,9 aldol reactions,10,11 Knoevenagel condensations,12 and Henry condensations.13 In our group, we have focused on the engineering of a natural
tautomerase, 4-oxalocrotonate tautomerase (4-OT). By exploiting the
nucleophilic character of the key catalytic residue Pro-1, we have
engineered 4-OT towards several enamine or iminium-mediated C–C
bond-forming reactions, including Michael-type additions and aldol
reactions.14−18

Despite large steps that have been made in techniques to construct
small smart libraries, typically only a small fraction of the mutants
within a library display the desired improved characteristics.19−21 Especially improving the catalytic rate is challenging, as it is
difficult to predict how mutations influence the catalytic machinery
of the enzyme. As a consequence, the screening of mutants is still
considered to be the bottleneck in enzyme engineering.20

Ultrahigh-throughput screening techniques,
such as fluorescence-activated
cell sorting (FACS)22 and fluorescence-activated
droplet sorting (FADS),23,24 have enabled the screening
of very large mutant libraries to enrich these libraries for active
mutants. The resulting enriched libraries are small enough that they
can be screened using lower throughput screening techniques such as
96-well assays, or high-performance liquid chromatography/gas chromatography
(HPLC/GC)-based assays to identify individual mutants with the desired
characteristic. The effectiveness of this approach was elegantly demonstrated
by the FADS-based directed evolution of retroaldolase RA95.5-8, improving
the catalytic efficiency >20-fold.11,25 However, these
techniques require specialized equipment and nontrivial reaction setup.

Here, we present a simple prescreening technique based on the iminium-activated
colorimetric turn-on probe 1b to prescreen large 4-OT
mutant libraries for improved activity toward the iminium-mediated
Michael-type addition of 2 to 1a (Figure 1). The principle
behind the prescreening technique is based on the iminium species
that is selectively formed between 1b and Pro-1 of 4-OT
(Figure 1). This structure
resembles a merocyanine dye and results in a new relatively bathochromic
absorption peak that can easily be observed by the naked eye. This
staining is not, or to a much lesser extent, observed in many inactive
mutants, which allows for those mutants to be excluded from subsequent
screenings. We applied this technique in a solid-phase preselection
assay that was termed as activated iminium colony staining (AICS).
AICS prescreening reduced screening efforts up to 20-fold and allowed
for the screening of large mutant libraries. After two rounds of directed
evolution, we could improve the Michaelase activity of 4-OT for the
addition of 2 to 1a up to 39-fold. We show
that the principle behind AICS can be extended to other iminium-based
biocatalysts like the class I aldolase 2-deoxy-d-ribose 5-phosphate
aldolase (DERA), which potentially paves the way for the engineering
of novel biocatalysts for iminium-mediated C–C bond-forming
reactions.

Results
Identification
of a Selective Turn-On Probe for 4-OT
Recently, it was shown
that Pro-1 of 4-OT can react with 1a to form complex 5a, a catalytic intermediate in the
Michael-type addition of 2 to 1a yielding 3.18 Analogously, we hypothesized
that 1b and 1c could react with Pro-1 of
4-OT to form 5b and 5c, respectively, structures
that bear chemical resemblance to Brooker’s merocyanine (4) (Figure 1). Compound 4 is a member of the diverse class of merocyanine
dyes, which are characterized by an electron-donating N-atom connected
via a streptopolymethine chain to an electron-withdrawing carbonyl
group.26,27 As a consequence, merocyanine dyes possess
a neutral and zwitterionic resonance form and have a relatively high
λmax. As compound 1b nor 1c nor free 4-OT bear this characteristic chemical scaffold, incubation
of 1b and 1c with 4-OT is expected to induce
the formation of complexes 5b and 5c, respectively,
each having a new relatively bathochromic absorption peak.

To
test this hypothesis, 1b and 1c were chemically
synthesized (Figure S1). As a control,
we synthesized compounds 1d and 1e that,
like substrate 1a, should not be able to form merocyanine
dye-type structures upon condensation with Pro-1 of 4-OT because they
lack an o-OH or p-OH group (Figure 1d). For testing,
we used 4-OT M45T/F50A, a well-studied 4-OT mutant that was constructed
for the synthesis of 1a via the aldol condensation of
acetaldehyde with benzaldehyde.15 Gratifyingly,
upon incubation of 1b or 1c with 4-OT M45T/F50A,
the color of the solution changed within a few seconds (Figure 2). Spectroscopic analysis revealed
the appearance of a novel absorption peak at 516 nm for 1b and 478 nm for 1c, whereas incubation of 4-OT M45T/F50A
with 1d and 1e did not reveal any new absorption
peaks (Figure 2). Especially,
the bright red species that was formed upon incubation of 1b with 4-OT M45T/F50A could clearly be seen by the naked eye, which
made 1b a powerful turn-on probe for 4-OT. A single-site
binding relationship between 1b and 4-OT M45T/F50A was
observed, with an estimated KD of 0.119
± 0.0055 mM, which indicates that binding of 1b to
4-OT is site-specific (Figure S2).

and absence of 4-OT M45T/F50A. (a) Absorption spectrum of 1b with and without 4-OT M45T/F50A. (b) Absorption spectrum of 1c with and without 4-OT M45T/F50A. (c) Absorption spectrum

spectra of 1e with and without 4-OT M45T/F50A. Conditions:
2.5% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), 20 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.3), 1
mM 1b–1e, 50 μM 4-OT M45T/F50A, 1 cm quartz
cuvettes.

To gain further evidence for the
formation of complex 5b, 4-OT M45T/F50A was incubated
with 1b for 15 min, followed
by the addition of NaCNBH3 to reduce any iminium species
and covalently trap the interaction of the probe and the protein.
Subsequent analysis by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS)
showed a mass consistent with that of 4-OT M45T/F50A modified with
a single molecule of 1b (Figure S3). Control reactions with 4-OT M45T/F50A incubated with only 1b or only NaCNBH3 did not show any modification.
The labeled 4-OT was digested with the endoproteinase Glu-C and the
resulting peptides were analyzed by ESI-MS, revealing the labeling
of 1b on the peptide fragment Pro-1 to Glu-9 (Figure S4). As Pro-1 is the only likely candidate
on this peptide to form an iminium species with 1b, Pro-1
was reckoned as the site of labeling.

Interestingly, incubation
of 1b with the enzyme 2-deoxy-d-ribose 5-phosphate
aldolase (DERA), a well-studied class I
aldolase,4,28 also resulted in an increase in absorbance
at 516 nm (Figure S5), implicating broader
applicability of probe 1b.

Mutants with Improved Michaelase
Activity Show Strong Staining
with 1b
Having developed a selective turn-on
probe for 4-OT, we were interested in applying this system to aid
our directed evolution efforts. Therefore, the effect of mutations
of 4-OT on staining with 1b was investigated. Cells producing
a defined set of 53 single mutants, covering nearly all single mutants
at positions 6, 45, and 50 were grown in a deep 96-well plate. These
positions were selected because mutations at these positions have
shown to influence the activity of 4-OT for several promiscuous reactions.14−16,18 Incubation of cells producing
the 53 single mutants with 1b demonstrated that single
mutations can significantly affect the staining with 1b (Figure S6). Most notably, single mutants
4-OT F50A, F50I, and F50V showed strong staining upon incubation with 1b. Interestingly, these three mutants were previously found
in a screen for mutants with enhanced activity for the Michael-type
addition of 2 to 1a, forming 3.18 These results prompted us to investigate
if 1b could be used as a prescreening tool to enrich
libraries for mutants with activity towards the Michael-type addition
of 2 to 1a yielding 3, a precursor
for phenibut, an important γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) analogue.

Activated Iminium Colony Staining-Based Directed Evolution of
4-OT
To improve the Michaelase activity of 4-OT for the addition
of 2 to 1a, we started by constructing a
triple-site NNK library. We randomized the active site residues Gln-4,
Leu-8, and Met-45 in the context of 4-OT F50A, the reported best mutant
for this reaction,18 yielding library Q4X/L8X/M45X/F50A.
The addition of 0.2% lactose to agar plates induced the expression
of 4-OT in freshly transformed cells, without any effect on the transformation
efficiency. A solution of 0.75% agarose containing 1b was poured on the agar plate and was allowed to solidify. Within
1 min, ∼5% of the colonies stained bright red and could be
distinguished from other colonies by the naked eye.

A total
of 1472 stained colonies were picked and screened for an improved
activity for the addition of 2 to 1a. Several
mutants with improved activity were identified. Almost all mutants
harbored the M45I mutation, without any obvious additive effect of
mutations at positions 4 and 8. Hence, double mutant 4-OT M45I/F50A
was constructed, which showed a 20-fold improvement in activity compared
to 4-OT F50A, using optimized reaction conditions (Figure 3).

Figure 3 Activity for the Michael-type
addition of 2 to 1a catalyzed by different
4-OT mutants. (a) Progress curve
of the Michael-type addition of 2 to 1a catalyzed
by different 4-OT mutants. (b) Initial rate of the Michael-type addition
of 2 to 1a catalyzed by different 4-OT mutants.
The data are presented as fold increase compared to the initial rate
of starting mutant 4-OT F50A. Assay conditions: 5% ethanol, 20 mM N-(2-hydroxyethyl)piperazine-N′-ethanesulfonic
acid (HEPES) (pH 6.5), 1 mM 1a, 100 mM 2, 50 mM sodium formate.

In the second round of
directed evolution, two libraries, 2–20_IA
and 21–40_IA, were constructed containing a single random mutation
from positions 2–20 and 21–40, respectively in the context
of 4-OT M45I/F50A. No mutations were introduced in the C-terminal
part of 4-OT (positions 41–62) as this region is highly important
for stabilization of the hexameric structure.29 The library was transformed into Escherichia coli cells, and colonies were stained using the AICS assay (Figure 4). Comparing the
activity of 92 stained colonies with 92 unstained colonies of library
21–40_IA demonstrated the high sensitivity of AICS prescreening,
as 32% of the stained mutants showed activity comparable or higher
than the parental mutant 4-OT M45I/F50A, whereas all of the unstained
mutants showed no activity or less than 50% of the activity of the
parental mutant 4-OT M45I/F50A (Figure 5).

the
AICS assay. Transformants of library 21–40_IA were stained
with the AICS assay as described in the Experimental
Section.

Figure 5 Activity for the Michael-type addition of 2 to 1a catalyzed by CFEs of 92 stained and 92
unstained colonies.
Colonies from cells that were freshly transformed with library 21–40_IA
were stained using the AICS procedure. In total, 92 stained colonies
and 92 unstained colonies were picked, grown overnight, and the CFE
was assayed for the Michaelase activity using substrates 2 and 1a. The Michaelase activity was measured in a plate
reader by following the depletion of 1a at 290 nm. Assay
conditions: 5% ethanol, 30% CFE, 0.5 mM 1a, 100 mM 2, 50 mM sodium formate. Analysis of CFEs of unstained colonies
by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE)
showed that eight out of 16 show significant 4-OT expression, indicating
that the AICS procedure can efficiently be used to eliminate colonies
not producing enzyme or producing enzyme with low-level activity.

From each library, 368 stained colonies were picked
and screened
for an improved activity for the addition of 2 to 1a. Although library 2–20_IA yielded many active mutants,
unfortunately, none were significantly more active than the parental
mutant 4-OT M45I/F50A. Gratifyingly, library 21–40_IA yielded
two improved triple mutants: 4-OT S37E/M45I/F50A and 4-OT A33E/M45I/F50A
with 29- and 39-fold improved activity compared to 4-OT F50A (Figure 3). The synthetic
usefulness of the newly engineered mutants 4-OT S37E/M45I/F50A and
4-OT A33E/M45I/F50A was demonstrated in semipreparative scale Michael-type
addition reactions using substrates 1a and 2. Target product R-3 could be obtained
in good to excellent isolated yield (up to 95%) and with excellent
enantiopurity (up to >99% enantiomeric excess, ee) (Table S1 and Figures S7–S11). Given that
only a small
number of colonies were assayed, these results demonstrate the power
of using the AICS prescreening tool for the rapid engineering of iminium
biocatalysis.

Discussion
The use and development
of novel, higher throughput screening systems
have drawn considerable attention.30 As
the screening of large mutant libraries is often limiting enzyme engineering
efforts, systems that reduce screening efforts or allow for higher
throughput of screening have significantly attributed to the success
of enzyme engineering studies.25,31,32 The design of novel smart (pre)screening techniques is therefore
expected to have a strong impact. We wanted to contribute to this
field by designing a smart iminium-based turn-on probe that could
be used to remove a considerable part of 4-OT mutants with no or low
activity from large mutant libraries.

Although there are a few
reports on turn-on probes that make use
of an activated lysine in the acceptor protein,33−35 these studies
focused on noncatalytic proteins. Instead, we aimed to design the
first iminium-activated turn-on probe for an enzyme, exploiting the
characteristic nucleophilic N-terminal proline of 4-OT. In the past,
we showed that 1a binds specifically to Pro-1 of 4-OT,
forming 5a (Figure 1d).18 Hence, we designed
turn-on probes 1b and 1c, which are close
mimics of substrate 1a. Incubation of 1b and 1c with 4-OT M45T/F50A resulted in the formation
of a novel relatively bathochromic absorption peak characteristic
of merocyanine dyes. Especially, incubation of turn-on probe 1b with 4-OT M45T/F50A induced a remarkable spectroscopic
shift that could easily be observed by the naked eye. Labeling studies
further supported our hypothesis that Pro-1 of 4-OT reacts with 1b to form merocyanine dye 5b. Note that substrate 1a and analogues 1d and 1e, which
were prepared as controls, cannot form merocyanine dye-type structures
upon condensation with Pro-1 of 4-OT because they lack an o-OH or p-OH group (Figure 1d).

Merocyanine dye 5b is very similar to 5a, a key catalytic intermediate
for the Michael-type addition of 2 to 1a. Therefore, we investigated if there
is a correlation between 4-OT single mutants that upon incubation
with probe 1b show strong staining and 4-OT single mutants
with improved Michaelase activity. Indeed, we found that, from a subset
of 4-OT single mutants, specifically mutants with enhanced Michaelase
activity showed strong staining upon incubation with 1b. This inspired us to use turn-on probe 1b as a prescreening
tool in the engineering of improved artificial Michaelases. We developed
the AICS technique, a colorimetric solid-phase prescreening procedure
based on selective staining of colonies producing an active 4-OT mutant
with 1b, and used it to enrich large libraries for active
4-OT mutants. The developed AICS prescreening technique proved to
be highly effective, reducing the screening effort for a single round
of directed evolution up to 20-fold. In addition, the sensitivity
of AICS prescreening proved to be very high, as from a subset of 92
unstained colonies all showed less than 50% activity compared to the
parental mutant.

After two rounds of directed evolution, two
triple mutants, 4-OT
S37E/M45I/F50A and 4-OT A33E/M45I/F50A, were identified with a 29-
and 39-fold improvement in activity compared to starting mutant 4-OT
F50A. Semipreparative scale reactions of the Michael-type addition
of 2 to 1a catalyzed by 4-OT S37E/M45I/F50A
and 4-OT A33E/M45I/F50A resulted in the isolation of target product R-3 with excellent yield (up to 95%) and enantiopurity
(ee up to >99%).

The developed AICS prescreening technique
provides a novel application
of turn-on probes, adding to the usage of turn-on probes as tools
for noninvasive tissue imaging or colorimetric pH sensors.36−38 Contrary to many reported colorimetric assays (e.g., refs (39−42)), AICS does not rely on a (coupled) chemical reaction producing
a chromogenic product, but instead solely relies on a conjugate formed
between the probe and the enzyme. As such, AICS is very quick and
nicely complements available reported colorimetric assays.

It
would be interesting to investigate the application of AICS
to a broader range of iminium biocatalysts, as preliminary results
indicate that turn-on probe 1b was also activated by
the lysine-dependent aldolase DERA. The further development of turn-on
probes as tools for enzyme engineering potentially opens up new possibilities
for the efficient engineering of novel classes of iminium-based biocatalysts.

Experimental
Section
Spectrophotometric Analysis of 1b–1e Incubated
with Purified 4-OT
A stock solution of 40 mM 1b–1e was prepared in 100% DMSO. A total of 25 μL was added to a
solution of 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.3) with and without
50 μM 4-OT M45T/F50A; the final volume was 1 mL. The mixture
was transferred to a 1 cm quartz cuvette and a spectrum from 350 to
800 nm was recorded. To analyze the binding behavior of 1b to 4-OT M45T/F50A, a binding curve was constructed. 1b (4–0 mM, 2-fold dilution series in 20 mM sodium phosphate
pH 7.3, 5% DMSO) was incubated with 4-OT M45T/F50A (50 μM) for
15 min (300 μL final volume). The mixtures were transferred
to 1 mm quartz cuvettes and the absorbance at 516 nm was recorded
and plotted against the concentration of 1b. The experiment
was performed in triplicate. SigmaPlot was used to fit the data against
the one-site saturation model and to calculate the apparent KD value (Figure S2).

Covalent Labeling of 1b to 4-OT
To gain
further evidence for the formation of 5b, 4 mM 1b was incubated with 150 μM 4-OT M45T/F50A in 10 mM
sodium phosphate (pH 7.3), 5% DMSO at room temperature; the total
volume was 500 μL. After 15 min, 167 μL of 100 mM NaCNBH3 was added in H2O to reduce any iminium species.
The reaction was incubated at room temperature for 30 min. The buffer
was exchanged to 10 mM ammonium formate in H2O using a
prepacked PD-10 sephadex G-25 gelfiltration column. A sample of the
collected enzyme was analyzed by ESI-MS (Figure S3). From the remaining fraction, 36 μL was digested
with GluC (New England BioLabs, 4 μL from a 100 ng/μL
stock solution) in a total volume of 80 μL for 24 h at 37 °C
using the supplied buffer. A sample from the digested mixture was
analyzed by ESI-MS. As controls, reaction without 1b and
reaction without the addition of NaCNBH3 (no reduction)
were included. In both cases, no modified 4-OT could be detected by
ESI-MS (Figures S3 and S4).

Staining of
4-OT Single Mutants with 1b
From a reported
set of 4-OT single mutants,16 BL21 DE3
glycerol stocks of all single mutants with a mutation at
positions 6, 45, or 50 were used to inoculate 1 mL of lysogeny broth
(LB) medium supplemented with ampicillin (100 μg/mL) and IPTG
(100 μM) and grown overnight at 37 °C in 96-deep well plates
(Greiner Bio-one, 96-well Masterblock), covered with sterile gas-permeable
seals (Greiner Bio-one, BREATHseal). The cells were harvested by centrifugation
and the supernatant was removed. The cell pellets were resuspended
in 200 μL of 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.3) and 50 μL
was transferred to a round bottom 96-well plate (96-well U-bottom,
Greiner Bio-One). To this, 2.5 μL of 40 mM 1b in
100% DMSO was added. The cells were allowed to settle on the bottom
of the 96-well plate.

Cloning and Mutagenesis
Triple-site
library 4-OT Q4X/L8X/M45X/F50A
was constructed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with degenerate
primers. The first part of the 4-OT gene was amplified using the following
primers: 5′-GGAGATATACATATGCCTATTGCCNNKATCCACATCNNKGAAGGCCGCAGCGACG-3′ and 5′-CAGGGAGCGCGAGATGGCC-3′.
The mutated codons Gln-4 and Leu-8 are indicated in bold. Met-45 was
randomized using primers 5′-GTGATTATCACGGAGNNKGCCAAGGGCCAC-3′ and 5′-GTGGCCCTTGGCMNNCTCCGTGATAATCAC-3′ by means of QuikChange technology. DNA
of 4-OT F50A was used as a template. The mutated codon Met-45 is indicated
in bold. The second part of 4-OT was amplified from the QuikChange
product using the following primers: 5′-GGCCATCTCGCGCTCCCTG-3′
and 5′-GCTAGGGGGATCCTCAGCGTCTGACCTTGCTGGCCAGTTCGCCGCC-3′,
using the QuikChange product as template. The amplified parts of the
4-OT gene were combined by overlap extension PCR and further amplified
using primers 5′-TTGAAGGAGATATACATATGCCT-3′ and 5′-GCTAGGGGGATCCTCAGCG-3′.
An empty pET20b backbone was generated by amplification of a pET20b
plasmid using the following primers: 5′-TGGGCAATAGGCATATGTATATCTCCTTCTTAAAGTTAAAC-3′
and 5′-AAGGTCAGACGCTGAGGATCCGAATTCGAGCTCCG-3′. The assembled
4-OT gene and the empty pET20b backbone were purified and digested
with restriction enzymes NdeI, BamHI, and DpnI. The empty pET20b backbone
was dephosphorylated using alkaline phosphatase. The digested DNA
products were purified and ligated by T4 DNA ligase. The ligation
mixture was purified and used to electroporate electrocompetent E. coli DH5α cells. After 1 h of outgrowth
with SOC medium, a small sample of the transformed DH5α cells
was spread on an agar plate to determine the transformation efficiency.
The remainder of the transformation mixture was added to 5 mL LB medium,
supplemented with ampicillin (100 μg/mL), and grown overnight.
The overnight culture was harvested and the plasmids were isolated
and used to transform BL21 DE3 cells.

For the construction of
library 2–20_IA, a previously reported set of nearly all single
mutants was used.16 From a glycerol stock,
each DH10B culture that carried a plasmid harboring a 4-OT gene with
a mutation at positions 2–20 was separately grown overnight
in 300 μL of LB medium supplemented with ampicillin (100 μg/mL). From all individual cultures,
100 μL of each was mixed together. From a sample of this mixed
culture, plasmid DNA was isolated to obtain a library of 4-OT genes
with a random single mutation at positions 2–20. The second
part of the 4-OT gene was amplified using the following primers: 5′-GATTATCACGGAGATTGCCAAGGGCCACGCCGGCATCGGCGGCG-3′ and
5′-GCTAGGGGGATCCTCAGCG-3′. The mutated residues Ile-45
and Ala-50 are indicated in bold. Using the library of 4-OT genes
with a random single mutation at positions 2–20 as a template,
the first part of the 4-OT gene was amplified using the following
primers: 5′-TTGAAGGAGATATACATATGCCT-3′ and 5′-CGCCGCCGATGCCGGCGTGGCCCTTGGCAATCTCCGTGATAATC-3′. Using
overlap extension PCR, a full-length 4-OT gene was obtained containing
a random mutation at positions 2–20, combined with the M45I
and F50A mutation. The full-length 4-OT gene was digested, ligated,
and cloned into the pET20b plasmid according to the procedure described
for the construction of the Q4X/L8X/M45X/F50A library to obtain library
2–20_IA. The same procedure was followed for the construction
of library 21–40_IA, using the single mutants with a mutation
at positions 21–40.

Expression and Purification of Enzymes
All 4-OT mutants
were expressed and purified according to a reported procedure.7 DERA with C-terminal His-tag was expressed and
purified from E. coli using the pET20b(+)
expression system. A colony of freshly transformed BL21 DE3 cells
was used to inoculate 5 mL of LB medium supplemented with ampicillin
(100 μg/mL) and grown for 8 h at 37 °C. This starter culture
was used to innoculate 100 mL of LB medium supplemented with ampicillin
(100 μg/mL) and lactose (0.2% w/v). The cells were incubated at 30 °C
overnight at 200 rpm in a shaker incubator. Cells were harvested by
centrifugation, resuspended in 30 mL of 20 mM potassium phosphate
buffer (pH 7.0), and lysed by sonication. The lysate was cleared by
centrifugation and transferred to a clean tube. Ni-sepharose (0.5
mL) was added to the lysate and incubated at 4 °C under slow
rotation for 30 min. The lysate with Ni-sepharose was loaded on a
column, washed with 8 mL of 20 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0),
followed by 8 mL of 20 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) containing
30 mM imidazole. Final elution was performed with 2.5 mL of 20 mM
potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) containing 250 mM imidazole (>95%
purity as assessed by SDS-PAGE). The buffer was exchanged to 20 mM
potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) using a prepacked PD-10 sephadex
G-25 gelfiltration column. The concentration of the purified enzyme
was determined by the Waddell method.43 DERA K167L was purified according to the same protocol. After purification,
the purified DERA and DERA K167L were immediately used in subsequent
experiments.

Activated Iminium Colony Staining (AICS)
BL21 DE3 cells
were transformed with library DNA and plated on LB agar plates supplemented
with ampicillin (100 μg/mL) and lactose (0.2% w/v). Colonies
were grown for ∼16 h at 37 °C, after which the agar plate
was stored at room temperature. A solution of 1.5% agarose in H2O was prepared by heating in a microwave and the solution
was kept at 60 °C. A second solution of 1 mM 1b dissolved
in 20 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.3) was filter sterilized and stored
at room temperature. Seven milliliters of the 1.5% agarose solution
were mixed with 7 mL of the solution containing 1 mM 1b in 20 mM sodium phosphate and immediately after mixing poured on
the agar plate. Typically, staining of the first colonies was observed after 10 s.
The plate was incubated at room temperature for 5 min to complete
the staining and the agarose was allowed to solidify. The staining
is stable for at least several hours. For screening of libraries 2–20_IA
and 21–40_IA, the concentration of 1b in the second
solution was reduced to 0.5 mM to increase the stringency of selection.

Library Screening
Colonies that showed clear staining
after the AICS assay were picked with sterile toothpicks and were
used to inoculate 1 mL of LB medium supplemented with ampicillin (100
μg/mL) and lactose (0.2% w/v) in 96-deep well plates (Greiner
Bio-one, 96-well Masterblock). Two wells in the 96-deep well plate
were used to inoculate the parental mutant (4-OT F50A or 4-OT M45I/F50A).
The plates were sealed with sterile gas-permeable seals (Greiner Bio-one,
BREATHseal) and incubated at 37 °C, with overnight shaking at
250 rpm. Eighty microliters of the culture were mixed with 20 μL
of a sterile solution of 80% glycerol in H2O and stored
at −80 °C for later reference. The remainder of the culture
was centrifuged. The supernatant was discarded and the pellets were
resuspended with 200 μL of BugBuster (Novagen) supplemented
with 15 U/mL benzonase (Novagen). After 20 min of incubation at room
temperature, the lysates were cleared by centrifugation after which
the CFE was obtained. For the screening of libraries 2–20_IA
and 21–40_IA, prior to centrifugation, the lysed cells were
diluted with 200 μL of sterile H2O. For the screening
of library Q4X/L8X/M45X/F50A, the final reaction mixture for monitoring
the addition of 2 to 1a consisted of 40%
CFE, 25 mM 2, 250 μM 1a, 5% ethanol
in 20 mM HEPES, pH 6.5; the final volume was 100 μL. For the
screening of libraries 2-20_IA and 21–40_IA, the final reaction
mixture for monitoring the addition of 2 to 1a consisted of 30% CFE, 100 mM 2, 1 mM 1a, 50 mM sodium formate, 5% ethanol in 20 mM HEPES pH 6.5; the final
volume was 100 μL. Sodium formate was added to the reaction
mixture, as this was found to positively affect the catalytic rate
of 4-OT M45I/F50A. The reaction was performed in a 96-well plate (Greiner
Bio-one, UV-star F-bottom microplate) and reaction progress was followed
in a plate reader by following the depletion in absorbance at 290
nm. For the screening of libraries 2–20_IA and 21–40_IA,
the initial absorbance was too high for the plate reader, so the time
point at which the absorbance went below the absorbance threshold
of the plate reader was used as a reference point for activity. For
the comparison of the activity of 92 stained mutants with 92 unstained
mutants, the same procedure as described for library 21–40_IA
was followed. However, the reaction mixtures consisted of 0.5 mM 1a instead of 1 mM 1a.

Progress Curves of the
Enzymatic Reactions
For monitoring
the progress of the enzymatic addition of 2 to 1a the following reaction setup was used. To a solution of 1a in ethanol, 2 in 20 mM HEPES (pH 6.5) and
purified 4-OT F50A, 4-OT M45I/F50A, 4-OT S37E/M45I/F50A or 4-OT A33E/M45I/F50A
were added. The final reaction mixture consisted of the following:
5% ethanol, 20 mM HEPES (pH 6.5), 1 mM 1a, 100 mM 2, 50 mM sodium formate, 20 μM 4-OT. The reaction mixtures
were transferred to 1 mm quartz cuvettes and the absorption at 290
nm was recorded every 20 s.

Semipreparative Scale Reactions
Semipreparative scale
experiments were performed using 4-OT S37E/M45I/F50A and 4-OT A33E/M45I/F50A
as biocatalysts. The reaction mixtures consisted of the following:
5 mL ethanol (5% v/v), 20 mg 1a, 25 mM 2, 50 mM sodium formate, 20 mM HEPES (pH 6.5), 7.5 μM enzyme;
the final volume was 100 mL. At timely intervals, a sample was withdrawn
from the reaction mixture and the reaction progress was monitored
by following the depletion in absorbance at 290 nm. After 10.5 h for
4-OT S37E/M45I/F50A and 7.5 h for 4-OT A33E/M45I/F50A, the reaction
was finished and the reaction mixture was extracted 3× with 20
mL ethyl acetate. The combined organic layers were washed with brine
and dried over anhydrous Na2SO4. For the reaction
catalyzed by S37E/M45I/F50A, the organic layer was concentrated in
vacuo, yielding 3 (27.8 mg, 95% isolated yield). For
the 4-OT A33E/M45I/F50A catalyzed reaction, the organic layer was
concentrated in vacuo and the product was purified by silica gel column
chromatography (hexane/ethyl acetate 4:1) to obtain 3 (16.0 mg, 55% yield).

Condensation of 1b with DERA
and 4-OT
The condensation of 1b with DERA and
4-OT was monitored
in time by following the absorbance at 516 nm. For the condensation
with DERA and DERA K167L, a 2× stock solution was prepared consisting
of the following: 20 mM potassium phosphate (pH 7.0), 10% DMSO, and
8 mM 1b. The stock solution (500 μL) was mixed
in a 1 cm quartz cuvette with 500 μL of 200 μM DERA or
DERA K167L (5.54 mg/mL) in 20 mM potassium phosphate (pH 7.0). Immediately
after mixing, the absorbance at 516 nm was measured every 0.5 s for
190 s. For 4-OT, a 2× stock solution was prepared consisting
of the following: 20 mM HEPES (pH 6.5), 10% ethanol, and 0.6 mM 1b. The stock solution (500 μL) was mixed in a 1 cm
quartz cuvette with 500 μL of 100 μM 4-OT in 20 mM HEPES
(pH 6.5). Immediately after mixing, the absorbance at 516 nm was measured
every 0.1 s for 190 s.

Derivatization of 3 for Enantiomeric
Excess Determination
The aldehyde functionality of 3 was derivatized to
a cyclic acetal according to a literature procedure.44,45 The enantiopurity of derivatized 3 was analyzed by
reverse-phase HPLC using a column with a chiral stationary phase (chiralpak
AD-RH, 150 mm × 4.6 mm, Daicel); detection at 220 nm, retention
time for R-3 was 8.8 min and for S-3, it was 12.2 min. The absolute configuration
was determined by literature comparison.16
