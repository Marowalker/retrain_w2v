B-form
DNA can adopt alternative structures under conditions such
as superhelical duress. Alternative DNA structures are favored when
there is asymmetric distribution of guanosine and cytosine on complimentary
DNA strands. A guanosine-rich strand can form a four-stranded structure
known as a quadruplex (G4). The complimentary cytosine-rich strand
can utilize intercalating cytosine–cytosine base pairing to
form a four-stranded structure known as the i-motif (iM). Both secondary
structures are energetically uphill from double-strand DNA (dsDNA),
meaning that additional factors are needed for their formation. Most
iMs require slightly acidic conditions for structure stabilization.
However, crowding agents such as polyethylene glycols and dextrans
can shift the pKa of the iM to near-physiological
pH ≈ 7. Nucleic acids have long been known to be bound and
stabilized by polyamines such as putrescine, spermidine, and spermine.
Polyamines have very high concentrations in cells (0.1–30 mM),
and their binding to DNA is driven by electrostatic interactions.
Polyamines typically bind in the minor groove of DNA. However, because
of the unusual structure of iMs, it was unknown whether polyamines
might also bind and stabilize iMs. The study described here was undertaken
to analyze polyamine–iM interactions. The thermal stability
and pH dependence of iM structures were determined in the presence
of polyamines. In contrast to dsDNA, our results suggest that polyamines
have considerably weaker interactions with iMs, as demonstrated by
the minimal change in iM pH dependence and thermal stability. Our
results suggest that polyamines are unlikely to provide a significant
source of iM stabilization in vivo.

Introduction
The Watson and Crick
B-form DNA structure created the foundation
for further investigation into the structure of this iconic biological
molecule.1 Subsequent work on DNA’s
plasticity resulted in the discovery of various alternative structures,
depending on environmental conditions.2 These are usually referred to as secondary structures to differentiate
them from B-form DNA. One well-studied secondary structure that is
dependent on clustered guanosines and utilization of Hoogsteen base
pairing is the quadruple helical structure called a G-quadruplex (G4).
Potential G4s have been identified across the genome in telomeres
and in promoters of genes often associated with the cell growth, such
as bcl-2, ras, VEGF, and c-myc.3−5 G4 structures have significant
stability under physiological conditions, allowing for their potential
as drug targets. Detection of G4s in cell nuclei has also been reported.6 In biotechnological applications, G4s can also
act as reporters for gene deletions7 and
for detection of silver, mercury, and other metal ions.8,9

While much is known about the role of G4-forming sequences
in biology,
much less is known about the complimentary strand that is rich in
cytosines. Cytosine-rich single-strand DNA can also form a four-stranded
structure. Under slightly acidic conditions (pH ≈ 6.5), the
N1 position of cytidine can be protonated, allowing three hydrogen
bonds to form between two cytidines.10 The
resulting four-stranded structure exhibits intercalated interactions
between planes of cytosine base pairs (Figure 2), and therefore, it has been referred to
as i-motif (iM) DNA. In early studies and in dilute solutions, at
increasing pH, the structural stability of iMs decreases to the point
that at physiological pH (∼7.3), little or no iM structure
remains.10 Hence, in the past, the iM has
attracted less attention than G4s because the nucleus does not appear
to be more acidic than the cytoplasm. However, more recent studies
have shown that addition of crowding agents and/or dehydrating cosolvents
can shift the pKa for the formation of
an iM toward more physiological pH.11−14 Longer C-rich sequences that
form iMs at pH ≈ 7 have also been reported.15 More recently, iM structures have also been observed in
cell nuclei, increasing interest in their possible biological role.16,17

Energetically, it is difficult for G4/iMs to be formed from
double-strand
DNA (dsDNA). The estimated free energy (ΔG)
needed to open the dsDNA to its single strands and form G4/iMs is
20–30 kcal/mol.18 Some of this free
energy can be provided by the negative supercoiling of DNA.19,20 Protein binding as the lone stabilizer of the G4/iM structures would
require a Kd of ∼10–14 M to provide this ΔG. However, nucleolin
binds G4s from the VEGF promoter with Kd ≈ 200 nM, which is energetically too low.21−23 Other proteins
that bind preferentially to the G4 structure have also been reported.24,25 Proteins known to bind the iM are the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleo-protein
K and polycytosine binding protein 2, both of which have a high affinity
for C-rich strands found in transcriptional promoter regions that
are known to form iM structures,26−28 but again the Kd’s are too low to fully support the
formation of iMs in vivo. One possible explanation for the observation
of iM formation in cells is synergism between supercoiling, protein
binding to iMs, and binding of other molecules. This paper addresses
the question as to whether polyamines, which are present in high concentrations
in cells, might be likely additional enhancers of iM stability.

There have been very few studies of the binding of small molecules
to iMs. Certain steroids have been reported to selectively bind to
regions of DNA that form a hairpin structure in C-rich DNA over the
iMs.29 However, a more abundant potential
source of iM-stabilizing molecules is polyamines. Polyamines are small
biomolecules synthesized in high (0.1–30 mM) concentrations
by cells,30 and they are known to be involved
in regulation of transcription.31,32 Polyamines bind to
the grooves of B-form DNA because of their overall net positive charge
at physiological pH. Polyamines such as putrescine, spermidine, and
spermine (Figure 1)
increase the thermal stability of B-DNA and additionally can induce
the transition of B-DNA to left-handed Z-DNA.33

to bottom: putrescine, spermidine, and spermine. All amino groups
are protonated and carry a positive charge at physiological pH (∼7.3)
or lower.

To the best of our knowledge,
no studies of polyamine binding to
iMs have been reported. Hence, in this report, we examined the effect
of polyamines on the physical properties of an iM sequence taken from
the nuclease-hypersensitive element found within the c-myc promoter (Figure 2). Our study examined the interactions between
the c-myc iM and the most prevalent polyamines found
in cells (putrescine, spermidine, and spermine). Our results are described
below.

Results and Discussion
Polyamine Binding to C6T iM
In this
study, a fixed
concentration of 2 μM of C6T iM was used to determine the binding
affinity of each of the three polyamines. Individual samples with
a known concentration of polyamine were mixed with a fixed C6T iM
concentration. Using electronic circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy,
a titration for each polyamine was observed, as shown in Figure 3. When the concentration
of polyamines increased in solution, an increase in the distinct iM
CD signal was observed. Saturation was eventually reached. There was
distinct variation in the concentrations needed to reach saturation.
For putrescine, it was ∼10 mM, while for spermidine and spermine,
it was ∼1 and ∼0.05 mM, respectively. This may reflect
the length of the polyamine, as our molecular docking (Figure 6) suggests that the grooves
of the 6CT iM may accommodate more than one putrescine. There are
two nonidentical grooves in the iM (Figure 6). On the basis of the analysis from Figure 3 of the binding plots,
the Kd for each polyamine was determined
and recorded in Table 1. We note that given the uncertainty
of the capacity of the iM to accommodate polyamines, the amount bound
is given as a fraction of total iM concentration (Table 2).

iM Dependence on Proton Concentration
As shown in Figure 4, we used CD spectroscopy to determine the
pKa for folding of the C6T iM in the presence
of saturating
concentrations of polyamines. Interestingly, there was no shift in
the pKa observed with any polyamine; the
pKa for iM folding under all conditions
was pH 6.2 ± 0.1. We analyzed the transition region of the pH-dependent
plots using a Wyman plot (Figure 4), which allowed determination of the proton uptake
required to transition from unfolded DNA to the iM in the presence
or absence of polyamines. In the absence of polyamines, the proton
requirement to fold the iM is approximately 3 protons per iM. This
is consistent with prior literature where slightly less than half
of the cytosines in an iM need to be protonated to stabilize the structure.34 Putrescine at high concentrations has little
or no effect on the proton requirement. However, an increase in protons
required for stabilization of the C6T iM is observed in the presence
of saturating amounts of spermine (∼4) and spermidine (∼6).
Our interpretation of these data is that as both spermine and spermidine
have long charged chains, their binding interferes with protonation
of the cytidines, likely due to charge neutralization of the phosphate
backbone. The net result is a requirement of additional protons to
stabilize the iM. This manifests in a more cooperative transition
from the unfolded to folded state, but the midpoint pH of the transition
remains constant.

where the final fraction was allowed to be ∼1.0.

Thermal Stability of C6T iM in the Presence
of Polyamines Using
UV–Vis Spectroscopy
The thermal stability of the C6T
iM was observed using UV–vis spectroscopy. The baseline C6T
iM thermal melting temperature (TM), which
is defined as the temperature when half of its concentration is in
the folded state (Figure 5), was measured at pH 5.3 where the C6T iM is most stable.
The observed TM in the absence of polyamines
was 45.4 ± 0.2 °C (Table 3).

At saturating concentrations of each of the polyamines and 2 μM
C6T, the TM was determined and recorded
in Table 3. A slight
increase in TM was observed for all of
the polyamines: ∼4 °C for putrescine and ∼8 °C
for spermidine and spermine. For comparison, we also examined the
effects on dsC6T. Consistent with prior literature,35 all polyamines have a pronounced increase (23–27
°C) on the TM of dsDNA. We interpret
the difference between iM and dsDNA as a function of the size and
shape of the grooves in the two structures. While dsDNA has a long,
narrow minor groove, iMs have two wide grooves (Figure 6). Binding of polyamines to dsDNA leads to significant charge
neutralization of the phosphate backbone and thus enhances thermal
stability. In contrast, polyamine binding to iM DNA appears to be
mainly located in the loops of the iM (Figure 6) and hence has little effect on the stability
of the core four-stranded structure.

trace. The results of molecular docking of polyamines are shown in
panels C and D along with space-filling models. Electrostatic charge
is shown from positive (blue) to neutral (white) to negative (red).
Putrescine is shown in yellow, spermidine in cyan, and spermine in

Molecular Modeling of Polyamine
Binding to iM DNA
We used AutoDock Vina to explore
the possible ways in which polyamines might bind to the C6T iM. Our
results are shown in Figure 6 and provide a good model to explain the binding data from Figure 3. Because of the
intercalated cytosines, the two grooves in an iM are very wide compared
to B-form dsDNA. The most likely location for putrescine is very near
the loops of the iM (Figure 6C,D). This likely explains the lower affinity for putrescine
for the iMs, inasmuch as the binding locations are limited because
it is the shortest polyamine used. If the docking model is correct,
there are essentially only two binding sites that favor putrescine.
In contrast, the longer spermidine can occupy both the loop regions
occupied by putrescine, as well as extending into the groove of the
iM (Figure 6C). This
would explain the biphasic binding curve of spermidine, where binding
to the loop not only has a fractional component with affinity similar
to putrescine but also has a groove binding component similar to spermine
(see Table 1). Finally,
our docking results indicate that spermine, the longest polyamine,
has the appropriate molecular dimensions to fit along both grooves
of the iM (Figure 6C,D). This would explain the much higher binding affinity of spermine
to the iM (Figure 3; Table 1).

Conclusions
In this paper, we concluded that although polyamines bind to iM
structures, their binding is weak compared to the more favorable binding
of polyamines to the same sequence in the double-strand form of DNA.
Using the nuclease-hypersensitive element found within the c-myc gene, denoted as C6T, a distinct iM structure was
formed without the presence of polyamines, which had a melting temperature
of 45.4 ± 0.2 °C at acidic pH, well above the physiological
temperature of 37 °C. Using CD spectroscopy, a titration curve
at pH 5.3 of varying concentrations of polyamines was produced, allowing
concentration saturations levels to be determined. These results indicated
that putrescine, spermidine, and spermine could reach binding saturation
to the C6T iM at concentrations of 10, 1, and 0.05 mM, respectively.
Using the data collected from CD, the Kd of polyamines’ binding to the C6T iM were determined. The
polyamines produced small but significant shifts in the thermal stability of
the iM, increasing its TM by 4–8
°C, which is in stark contrast to their ability to shift dsDNA
by increasing its TM by ∼23 °C.

It was determined that at saturating concentrations of polyamines,
the change in the required amount of protons to stabilize the C6T
iM structure is increased. Putrescine displays a small increase in
required protons possibly because of the small nature of putrescine
as a biomolecule. However, both spermidine and spermine required additional
protons, indicating that they may affect the ability of the core cytidines
of the iM to form the four-stranded structure. However, no effect
on the pKa required to form the iM was
observed. Hence, the effect of polyamines appears to be solely on
the cooperativity of folding.

Overall, it was determined that
the most abundant cellular polyamines
putrescine, spermidine, and spermine have the ability to bind to the
C6T iM structure, albeit weakly, and to add some stability to the
structure. However, none of our data suggests that polyamines have
a particularly important role in stabilizing iM structures in vivo.
Because of their high concentrations in cells, the polyamines may
contribute a certain level of stability to iMs but nowhere near the
20–30 kcal/mol required to stabilize an iM/G4 from opened dsDNA.
Hence, other factors that stabilize iMs are part of the ongoing investigation
in understanding their physical properties in cells. While our results
pertain solely to the cytosine-rich strand of DNA, we anticipate that
our findings are readily transferable to the situation where iMs are
formed in dsDNA.

Materials and Methods
Materials
The
iM-forming oligonucleotide (C6T; Figure 2) used was synthesized
by and purchased from Midland Certified Reagent Co., Inc. (Midland,
TX). C6T is a good model iM because it undergoes a simple two-state
transition from folded to unfolded form.36 C6T iM oligonucleotide stock was stored in a 10 mM Tris, 1 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic
acid (EDTA) buffer at pH 8.0 in a −20 °C freezer. The
sodium cacodylate, Tris-HCl, and EDTA used to create buffer solutions
were purchased from Fisher Scientific (Pittsburgh, PA). Putrescine,
spermidine, and spermine were purchased from Sigma Aldrich (St. Louis,
MO).

Polyamine Binding Constants
Binding of polyamines was
monitored by electronic CD spectra of the iM DNA. Addition of polyamines
resulted in a strong increase in CD signal at 290 nm, which appeared
to show typical saturation at higher concentrations. We analyzed this
signal change via transformation of the data into a binding curve
analysis (Figure 3).
The binding plots for putrescine and spermine showed a standard sigmoidal
curvature, which could be well fitted to a single site binding model.
However, the binding of spermidine was better fit with a model of
two classes of independent binding sites (n1, n2) with independent binding constants Kd1 and Kd2 (e.g.,
the Klotz model).37 The spermidine data
were fit to eq 1, where
r is the fraction of iM with the ligand bound and L is the free polyamine concentration 1  

pKa Determination
Samples
were prepared in the same way as for binding analysis. Both polyamine
binding and pKa (the midpoint of the pH-dependent
folding for iM) were determined using CD spectroscopy. To determine
the pKa for iM folding (i.e., the pH at
which 50% of the oligo is folded into the iM), CD spectra of DNA solutions
at 20 °C were collected from 250–320 nm on an Olis DSM
20 CD instrument fitted with a Peltier heat block (Olis, Inc. Bogart,
GA, USA). An integration time as a function of high voltage was used.
The CD signals observed at 298 nm were then plotted against pH, and
then eq 2 was applied
to obtain pKa and the cooperativity parameter.
The cooperativity parameter reflects the slope of the transition from
folded to unfolded iM. A technical caution: as polyamines are weak
bases and are used at high concentrations, we emphatically note that
the pH of buffers containing polyamines have to be adjusted to the
correct pH for each concentration of polyamine used. 2  

To better understand the cooperativity
parameter, a Wyman-type plot34,38 was used to determine
the proton difference (ΔQ) between the folded
and unfolded iM. ΔQ can be determined via the
slope of each of the Wyman plots of log K versus
pH, where K is the equilibrium constant between unfolded
and folded iM (defined in eq 5 below) 3  

Thermal Denaturation Studies
Relative
to B-form or
single-strand DNA, the iM structures show a pronounced hypochromic
and bathochromic shift in their UV–visible absorbance spectra
that can be monitored at 260 nm to determine folded and unfolded states
(Figure S1). Solutions of the C6T iM oligonucleotide
(2 μM) in 30 mM cacodylate buffer at pH 5.3 were prepared with
varying concentrations of polyamines. Melting of the C6T iM with and
without polyamines was done using a Cary 100 UV–visible spectrometer
(Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). Prior to experimentation,
each sample was heated to 80 °C for 5 min and then cooled to
room temperature for two cycles to ensure removal of mismatched DNA
dimers. Thermal denaturation recordings were made by monitoring the
absorbance at 260 nm while increasing the temperature between 20 and
94 °C at a ramping rate of 2 °C per min and a 1 min hold
at each temperature. All thermal denaturation experiments could be
fit to a simple two-state model.

The two-state model for DNA
melting is described by 4  and 5  where K is the equilibrium
constant for unfolding, [U] and [N] are the concentrations of unfolded and folded states, respectively,
and T is the temperature in kelvin at each point
along the melting transition.

The mole fraction of unfolded
DNA f(U) is given by 6  

The free energy of unfolding at any given temperature T is given by the following 7  

The fraction folded was normalized from 0 to 1 prior to fitting,
and the change in heat capacity (ΔCp) was assumed to be negligible. The nonlinear regression
fits yielded the values for Tm and ΔHm. Note that in eq 7, ΔHm reflects the
slope of the thermal transitions shown in Figure 5. Because there were no significant differences
in slopes for all the conditions used, we have not reported separate
ΔHm values, but its average value
was ∼33 kcal/mol.

Visualization of the Best-Predicted Polyamine
Binding Location
Using the open source program AutoDock Vina,39 the most likely locations of molecular docking
of the polyamines
to the C6T iM were determined. The model of C6T used was built by
us and has been described previously.40 The polyamine torsion angles were set to move freely to simulate
their flexibility. Both the iM and polyamine structures were assigned
charges found at physiological pH. The output was visualized using
UCSF CHIMERA.41
