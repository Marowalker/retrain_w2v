The
synthesis of six tetrathia–oligothiophene macrocycles
is described with modest ring-closing yields between 21 and 55%. Single-crystal
X-ray studies of four of the macrocycles indicated that encapsulated
solvent or guest molecules were possible. A variety of guest molecules
were explored for inclusion complexes via NMR, absorption, emission,
and X-ray techniques. The solution-phase inclusion complexes were
uninformative; yet the solid-state experiments revealed that solvent
exchangeable channels exist through the macrocyclic pores.

Introduction
Macrocycles are at
the foundation of supramolecular chemistry that
earned Cram, Lehn, and Pedersen the 1987 Nobel Prize.1−3 The synthesis of novel macrocycles exploded in the literature and
common shape-inspired names include crown ethers, spherands, and cryptands.
Synthetic strategies in the isolation of macrocycles often employ
multistep procedures, which can result in low yields and poor scalability.
However, notable exceptions include intramolecular hydrogen bond networks
of Zeng,4 dynamic covalent bond formations
of MacLachlan,5 or the anion-templated
assemblies of Flood.6 The synthetic macrocyclic
field was recently reviewed by Stoddart in 2017,7 which highlights the modern trends such as stimuli-responsiveness,
3-D shapes, and rigidification.

Recent synthetic macrocycle
families include cucurbit[n]urils, pillar[n]arenes, calix[n]arenes, “blue
box, exboxes, and excages” by Stoddart
et al. and π-conjugated macrocycles such as cycloparaphenylenes.
Despite the large number of macrocyclic analogs published, there remains
significant chemical space to investigate and we elected to focus
on thiophene-containing thioether macrocycles. Moreover, the use of
oligothiophenes as building blocks of the macrocycles provide the
host molecules an optical channel to probe potential inclusion interactions
with optically silent guests. Independently, thiophene-containing8−12 or thioether11,13 macrocycles are not novel; however,
in combination, the macrocycles are largely unexplored as electron-rich
large hosts. Figure 1 shows the six thiophene-containing thioether macrocycles investigated.

Results and Discussion
The six macrocycles, or cyclophanes,
are divided into two families,
based on either the bithiophene (biTh) or terthiophene (terTh) units
that are linked through thioethers and bridging methylenes that vary
in length from butyl to hexyl. The six cyclophanes in Figure 1 result in ring sizes that
vary from to 24 to 34 atoms with interior dimensions that vary from
approximately 7.7 Å by 6.9 Å for C4biTh to 12.1 Å by 4.3 Å for C4terTh in select single-crystal
structures.

The macrocyclic synthesis is initiated with commercially
available
bi- and terthiophene, which was dilithiated with 2.2 equiv of n-BuLi and then quenched with elemental sulfur to give bi-
and terthiophene polysulfides, as shown in Scheme 1.14 Both polysulfides
were then reduced with sodium borohydride, forming their respective
bis thiolates, followed by addition of 1,4-bromobutane, 1,5-dibromopentane,
or 1,6-dibromohexane, to give BrCnbiTh or BrCnterTh. Isolated yields for the
thioether formation were between 40 and 60% over two steps starting
from the parent oligothiophene. The terminal alkyl dibromides were
then reacted with another equivalent of either bis-thiolate-bithiophene
or bis-thiolate-terthiophene to produce the six macrocycles that vary
both the thiophene conjugation length and the alkyl spans of the macrocycles.
Crystallization is the preferred purification method for the macrocycles C5biTh, C6biTh, C5terTh, and C6terTh, owing to decomposition by silica gel column
chromatography. All of the macrocyclic products were characterized
by 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy and high-resolution
mass spectrometry, as described in the Supporting Information.

Scheme 1 Synthesis of CnbiThs and CnterThs Macrocycles; (i) n-BuLi, Then Elemental S; (ii) NaBH4, Then Either
1,4-Bromobutane,
1,5-Dibromopentane, or 1,6-Dibromohexane; (iii) PolySSbiTh, NaBH4, Then BrCnbiTh; (iv) PolySSterTh, NaBH4, Then BrCnterTh
The macrocyclic ring formation
conditions resulted in modest yields
of ca. 40% for the CnbiThs, which dropped to approximately 20% yields
for the larger terthiophenes, CnterThs. The higher yields of the bithiophene
macrocycles could be explained by the shorter tether (entropic effect)
enabling a U-shaped intermediate that can be more readily ring-closed,
given that the ring-closing reaction concentrations were the same.

Single crystals of the CnbiTh series of macrocycles are shown in Figure 2 along with the sole
terthiophene macrocycle, C4terTh. The remaining terthiophene macrocycles did not form
resolvable crystals. The C4biTh and C6biTh macrocycles share similarities in the solid-state structure, such
as a nearly 100° C–S–C thioether corners and co-planar
bithiophenes. The C5biTh macrocycle deviates from both C4- and C6-bithophenes
because the two bithiophene moieties are no longer parallel to each
other. The C4terTh macrocycle shows the conjugated terthiophenes are co-planar, but
the two planes of terthiophenes are perpendicular. Note, the cavity
of C4biTh is not
empty as shown in Figure 2; rather there is unresolvable solvent within the cavity discussed
below. Interestingly, a view down the b-axis of C4biTh reveals a one-dimensional
channel filled with disordered solvent, which is absent in the packing
of the other macrocycles. The slightly larger cavities of both C5- and C6-bithiophenes co-crystallized with cyclohexane.
For C5biTh, steric
pressure from the co-crystallized cyclohexane molecule causes the
observed out-of-plane twisting of the biothiophene linkers. The cyclohexane
in C5biTh is best
described as encompassed by two adjacent macrocycles, as can be seen
in the Supporting Information X-ray data
files. Conversely, C6biTh has enough cavity space to accommodate completely a single cyclohexane
guest. There are limited examples of macrocyclic host complexes that
capture cyclohexane.15−17 On the other hand, no solvent molecules were found
in the C4terTh structure
because the macrocyclic ring collapsed in the solid-state, likely
because of the flexible butyl walls.

at 50% probability.

For C4biTh, the
intermolecular solid-state interactions are limited to Ar(C–H)···S(Ar)
and sulfide(S)···H2C(alkyl). Similar weak
intermolecular interactions are shown in the other macrocycles (Supporting Information). In addition, there are
no short contacts between the macrocycles and the trapped cyclohexane,
which suggests the guest solvent is weakly bound and could be exchangeable.

Naturally, the macrocycles were examined for guest inclusion chemistries.
Supramolecular assemblies were assessed using NMR, absorption, and
fluorescence spectroscopies and powder X-ray techniques. The 1H NMR experiments of all the host macrocycles in a variety
of solvents showed no evidence of intermolecular interactions, suggesting
the interactions are very weak or the size of the cavity in solution
is insufficient.

The 1H NMR of C4biTh in a variety of solvents is
shown in Figure 3,
which clearly displays the
chemical shift of both thiophene β-protons (Ha and
Hb) and the methylene protons (Hc and Hd) are solvent-dependent. The remainder of the macrocycles
in the 1H NMR study are included in the Supporting Information. As a control, linear n-pentyl chains were appended to both the bi- and terthiophene sulfides
to assess the effect of ring closure on the 1H NMR (Supporting Information). The changes in thiophene
β-proton chemical shifts in different solvents of the macrocycles
are mirrored in the noncyclic control, suggesting the thiophenes of
the macrocycle are not affected by the macrocyclic ring constraint.
However, the methylene protons did show a change in coupling pattern
in the linear versus macrocycle, consistent with constraint. Whereas
the 1H NMR peaks do shift in different solvents, titrations
of mixed solvent additions, for example cyclohexane in pyridine, did
not show any indications of inclusion-induced peak shifts or broadening.
At 1H NMR concentrations, no evidence of host–guest
binding was observable; thus, a move toward more sensitive optical
techniques to assess intermolecular interactions was sought.

Figure 3 1H NMR peak shifts of the C4biTh macrocycle in five deuterated solvents (dimethyl
sulfoxide, pyridine, tetrahydrofuran, chloroform, and benzene).

The bi- and terthiophene macrocycles
are spectroscopically active
with emissive properties in solution (Supporting Information); consequently, absorption and fluorescence studies
were undertaken to probe the electronic effects of different guests
in the chromophoric macrocycles. A wide range of guest molecules were
investigated with no impact on the electronic properties of the macrocycles,
as illustrated for C4biTh in Figure 4. A complete
list of all the guest molecules investigated can be found in the Supporting Information. The lack of electronic
spectral changes with a variety of guests suggests the macrocycles
present too many degrees of freedom in solution, leading to entropic
effects that preclude guest-binding.

Figure 4 Absorption and emission spectra (λexc = 335 nm)
of a 20 μM solution of C4biTh dissolved in ethanol (blue) in the presence of
1000 equiv of adamantine (red), cholesterol (green), camphor(purple),
menthol (orange, not visible because of overlap), bisphenol A (brown),
butylated hydroxytoluene (black), or dodecanoic acid (pink, not visible
because of overlap).

The X-ray structures of the bithiophene series suggested
the solvent
molecules are weakly bound and might be exchangeable in the solid
state. For these experiments, single crystals (formed from a mixture
of chloroform, hexanes, and trace ethyl acetate) were collected and
placed in vials containing single solvents. The Supporting Information shows powder X-ray diffractograms of
these solvent exchange experiments for C4biTh. For C4biTh, chloroform, acetonitrile, and nitromethane were
selected as candidate guests based on molecular guest size. The simulated
powder pattern from the single crystal shown in Figure 2 resembles the crystals in either chloroform
or nitromethane, suggesting the framework of the channels was preserved,
but does not necessarily support or refute solvent exchange. More
insight was gained when single crystals of C4biTh were placed in vials and a small
volume (∼1 mL) of chloroform or nitromethane was layered on
top for 4 days. The single crystals in chloroform slowly dissolved
and were not recovered, whereas the single crystals bathed in nitromethane
were recovered and remounted on the diffractometer. The solved X-ray
structure of C4biTh in nitromethane showed no changes to the macrocycle packing and
only disorder in the channels, implying nitromethane exchange in the
solid state was inconclusive.

Conversely, the acetonitrile solvent
exchange experiment shows
the appearance of several new peaks in the diffractogram that are
not present in the simulated spectrum, consistent with a change in
crystal structure and a potential solid-state guest exchange process.
Remounting of a single crystal after exposure to acetonitrile for
4 days resulted in a structure that indeed included acetonitrile in
the macrocyclic pocket, as shown in Figure 5. The single crystal was observed over several
days via microscopy and exhibited no change in crystal shape, suggesting
exchange; however, we cannot preclude dissolution and re-deposition
on the crystal surface. In addition, a significant re-arrangement
of the crystal packing of the macrocycle occurred such that the open
one-dimensional channel was closed after acetonitrile inclusion. Crystallographic
information of C4biTh-containing bound CH3CN is included in the Supporting Information. The crystal-to-crystal
transformation maintains the square shape, but the bithiophene changes
from a syn- to anti-arrangement upon encapsulating acetonitrile. The
simulated powder diffractogram, shown in the Supporting Information, contains several peaks that align with the acetonitrile-soaked C4biTh powder diffractogram,
suggesting efficient guest exchange occurred in the solid-state through
the open pores.

suggesting solvent exchangeable pores.

Conclusions
In summary, six new bi- and terthiophene macrocycles
were synthesized
and characterized, including single-crystal structures for four. Solution
studies to probe inclusion phenomena of small guest molecules were
largely unsuccessful, suggesting too much flexibility in the macrocyclic
structure to overcome the weak intermolecular interactions. However,
upon immersion of the crystals in different solvents the powder X-ray
pattern did change, suggesting guest exchange was occurring through
the porous cavity, which was confirmed via X-ray structure determination
for C4biTh in the
presence of acetonitrile.
