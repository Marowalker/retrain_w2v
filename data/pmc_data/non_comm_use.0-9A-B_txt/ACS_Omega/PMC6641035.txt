Inspired
by the unique geometry and novel properties of a newly
proposed two-dimensional (2D) carbon allotrope called pentagraphene,
we have performed first-principles calculations to study the structural
stability and electronic properties of pentagermanene (pGe) modulated
by chemical functionalization and biaxial tensile strain. It is observed
that the 2D pGe is energetically unfavorable. However, the 2D pentagonal
nanosheets can be stabilized by both hydrogenation and fluorination.
Phonon dispersion spectrum and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations
demonstrated that the dynamic and thermal stabilities of the two functionalized
pGe nanostructures can be maintained even under a high temperature
of 500 K. Our calculations revealed that both hydrogenated and fluorinated-pentagonal
germanenes are semiconductors with indirect band gaps of 1.92 and
1.39 eV (2.60 and 2.09 eV by the hybrid functional), respectively.
The electronic structures of the functionalized pGes can be effectively
modulated by biaxial tensile strain, and an indirect to direct gap
transition can be achieved for the hydrogenated pGe sheet by 6% biaxial
strain. Moreover, the band gap of the hydrogenated pGe could be further
tailored from 0.71 to 3.46 eV (1.16–4.35 eV by the hybrid functional)
by heteroatom doping (C/Si/Sn/Pb), suggesting the semiconductor–insulator
transition for differently doped nanostructures. As a result, the
functionalized pGes are expected to have promising applications in
nanoelectronics and nanomechanics.

Introduction
Graphene, presenting
exceptional properties derived from the truly
two-dimensional (2D) nanostructure, has rapidly and continually attracted
enormous interests of researchers in various disciplines since its
fabrication in 2004.1 Inspired by the exotic
properties originating from the 2D nanostructure, group-IV (silicon,
germanium, and tin) analogues have been theoretically and experimentally
investigated.2,3 The 2D silicene, germanene, and
stannum sheets with low-buckled structures are predicted to be stable
at first through first-principles calculations,4−6 and then they
have been experimentally fabricated on a metal surface7−12 Furthermore, the characterized electronic properties of the group-IV
analogues in experiments are in good agreement with the computational
modeling reported previously. It is noticed that most inorganic nanosheets
possess hexagonal lattices similar to those of graphene, such as binary
BN nanosheets with flat honeycomb13 and
transition-metal dichalcogenides (MoS2, WS2,
and MoSe2) with buckled honeycomb.14,15 In addition, the recently fabricated black-phosphorene nanosheets
with puckered nanostructure can also be regarded as akin to
hexagonal lattices.16,17

More recently, a new 2D
carbon allotrope named pentagraphene, presenting
a tetragonal lattice with threefold and fourfold coordinated hybrid
carbon sheets, was proposed by computational modeling.18 The pristine pentagraphene is found to have
negative Poisson’s ratio, ultrahigh strength, and reduced thermal
conductivity compared to those of graphene.19 More importantly, first-principles calculations have revealed that
pentagraphene is a semiconductor with a quasidirect band gap of 3.25
eV, suggesting that it could be a promising candidate for possible
applications in the field of nanoelectronics and optoelectronics.20,21 In addition, some pentagraphene-like analogues have also been proposed
and predicted to be stable at room temperature.22−24 Meanwhile,
surface decoration can be utilized to improve the stability, electronic
structure, and thermal conductivity of 2D nanomaterials.25−28 Previous studies have shown that the energetic and mechanical stabilities
of pentasilicene can be greatly improved via hydrogenation,29 the electronic and mechanical properties of
pentagraphene can also be effectively modulated by hydrogenation and
fluorination,30 and unexpected enhancement
in the thermal conductivity can be obtained for the hydrogenated pentagraphene.31

Recently, Goldberger’s research
group has fabricated free-standing
monolayers of hydrogenated germanium (GeH) and methylated germanium
(GeCH3) by a chemical method, and their characterizations
on these monolayer germananes have shown that they have large direct
band gaps and high electron mobilities.32−34 More importantly, previous
studies have shown that the structural stability, electronic structure,
and transport properties of Ge-based 2D nanomaterials can be improved
by covalent chemistry decoration of different surface ligands,35−38 allowing us to tailor desirable properties to achieve practical
applications in the fields of electronics and optoelectronics.39−42

Motivated by the advance of chemically functionalized Ge-based
2D nanomaterials and the penta structure with tetragonal lattice,
researchers would wonder the possibility of experimental realization
of pentagermanene (pGe) and the influences of chemical functionalization
on the stability and electronic structures of pGe. Thus, in this article,
we have carried out first-principles calculations to study the structural
stability of pristine pGes and chemically functionalized pGes by analyzing
the phonon dispersion and adsorption energy. It is found that pristine
pGe is dynamically unstable; however, the Ge-based pentagonal structure
can be stabilized by hydrogenation and fluorination. Furthermore,
the influences of biaxial strain on the electronic properties of hydrogenated
and fluorinated pGes have been investigated in detail. The band gap
of the hydrogenated pGe could be further tailored by heteroatom doping
(C/Si/Sn/Pb). Our results could be helpful in understanding the electronic
properties of Ge-based nanomaterials and may be useful for the development
of Ge-based electronics.

Results and Discussion
Figure 1a shows
the atomic structural geometry of pristine pGe, presenting a tetragonal
lattice consisting of four pentagons in the primitive cell. The optimized
lattice constant of the pristine pGe is a = 5.668
Å, and the structure possesses the P4̅21m symmetry (space group no. 113). The unit
cell comprises two tetracoordinated Ge atoms and four tricoordinated
Ge atoms, and for convenience, they are labeled as Ge1 and Ge2, respectively.
Furthermore, we label the pristine pGe as pGe in the following discussions.
For the pGe nanostructure, the bond length of Ge1–Ge2 atoms
is R1 = 2.508 Å and that of Ge2–Ge2
atoms is R2 = 2.505 Å. The basal
plane of pGe is puckered, and the buckling distance (determined by
the vertical height difference between the Ge1 and Ge2 layers shown
in Figure 1a) is h = 1.308 Å, which is much larger than the corresponding
values of pentagraphene18 and pentasilicene.29 This is attributed to the largest atomic radii
of germanium atoms. Moreover, the bond angle of Ge2–Ge1–Ge2
is θ1 = 105.78°, and the bond angle of Ge1–Ge2–Ge1
is θ2 = 106.07°, indicating distinct sp3 hybridized bonds. To assess the dynamic stability of the
2D pGe, we have measured the phonon spectrum of the pentagonal structure,
as shown at the bottom of Figure 1a. The presence of imaginary vibration in the phonon
dispersion shows that the pGe structure is dynamically unstable. The
detailed analysis shows that the two soft modes around the Γ-point
are associated with the tricoordinated Ge2 atoms because the Ge2 atoms
are arranged
in an unfavorable, highly buckled configuration and they prefer transforming
into sp2 hybridization, causing soft modes to collapse
the 2D sheet. Overall, the Ge2 atoms tend to distort the pentagonal
structure, leading to the dynamical instability.

the optimized structures along with their
phonon dispersions of the (a) pristine (pGe) and (b) hydrogenated
(H–pGe–H) and (c) fluorinated (F–pGe–F)
pGes. The squares marked by blue dashed lines denote the unit cell.
The highlighted yellow spheres refer to the fourfold coordinated Ge1
atoms in each system.

To improve the structural stability of pGe, the key is to
stabilize
the buckled structure of Ge2 atoms. Thus, a powerful route to enhance
the stability is chemical functionalization, which has been widely
used to tune the properties of low-dimensional nanostructures,39,44 including the Ge-based nanomaterials.37,45 Indeed, previous
experimental studies have shown that both hydrogenated- and methylated-germanene
sheets with graphene-like lattices are stable at room temperature.33,36,42 The fluorinated-germanene sheet
and various chemically functionalized group-IV 2D nanosheets hereafter
are suggested to be topological insulators.3,46−48 The methylated germanene can also be driven into
a topologically nontrivial state by biaxial strain.49,50 Therefore, we explore the structural stability of the hydrogenated
and fluorinated pGes. Thus, for pGe sheets, considering that there
are four unsaturated Ge2 atoms per unit cell, we decorate the top
of Ge2 atoms
by hydrogenation and fluorination, where all Ge atoms become tetracoordinated,
as shown in Figure 1b,c. They are labeled as H–pGe–H and F–pGe–H,
respectively. Correspondingly, the hydrogenated and fluorinated hexagonal
germanenes are labeled as H–Ge–H and F–Ge–F
for comparison, respectively. For the nanostructures of the hydrogenated
and the fluorinated pGe, it is noted that the ratio of Ge/H or Ge/F
is 3:2. The structure parameters of the hydrogenated and fluorinated
germanenes and the pGe are listed in Table 1. As can be seen clearly, hydrogenation in
H–pGe–H results in a decrease in the bond length, which
is due to a significant reduction in the lattice constant. In contrast,
the structural changes in fluorinated F–pGe–F are subtle.
It is noticed that the buckling distances of the hydrogenated and
fluorinated pGe’s have experienced a little change when compared
with those in the pristine pGe sheet. This is in sharp contrast to
the cases of pentagraphene and the corresponding results of hydrogenated
and fluorinated pentagraphenes.30 To examine
the dynamical stability of the hydrogenated and fluorinated nanostructures,
we have performed phonon calculations of H–pGe–H and
F–pGe–F sheets, as shown at the bottom of Figure 1b,c. Obviously, there are no
soft modes throughout the whole Brillouin zone (BZ), confirming the
dynamical stabilities of the two functionalized pGe sheets.

(in eV), and Eg-HSE06 (in eV)

To examine the energetic stability
of the hydrogen and fluorine
atoms with respect to pGe, we have calculated the binding energy, Eb, defined as Eb = −(Etotal – EpGe – 4Eadatom), where Etotal, EpGe, and Eadatom denote the total energies of the H–pGe–H
and F–pGe–F sheets, pGe sheet, and isolated hydrogen
and fluorine atoms. Considering that there are four hydrogen and fluorine
adatoms per unit cell, we average the binding energy on each decorated
atom. The binding energy denotes the interaction strength between
the adsorption atom and the undecorated penetagermanene and germanene
sheets. The binding energy of fluorination is found to be larger than
that of hydrogenation for both pentagonal and hexagonal structures
because fluorine has superior negativity compared to that of hydrogen.
It is worth mentioning that the binding energies of hydrogen and fluorine
with hexagonal germanene sheets are 0.25 eV/H and 3.21 eV/F,35,38,43 which are smaller than the corresponding
values for pGe sheets. The larger binding energies of hydrogen and
fluorine with the pGe sheet demonstrate that these chemical functionalizations
are energetically more favorable than those of the 2D hexagonal sheet.
These results can be understood from the differences in the tricoordinated
Ge2 atoms with nearly sp3 hybridization in the pGe sheet
and the partially delocalized π orbital arising from sp3-like hybridization. Therefore, the Ge2 atoms in the 2D pGe
sheet are chemically more active than the Ge atoms in the hexagonal
germanene.

To address the enhancement in the thermal stability
induced by
hydrogenated and fluorinated functionalization, we have further performed
ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulation at 300 and 500 K, respectively.
The 2D chemically functionalized sheet is expanded to a 3 × 3
supercell consisting of 90 atoms. Figure 2 presents the total energy fluctuations and
the final structures of the functionalized H–pGe–H and
F–pGe–F sheets at the end of AIMD simulations, and the
corresponding results for the pristine pGe sheet are also shown for
comparison. The time step is set to be 2 fs, and 2.5 and 5 ps AIMD
simulations are carried out for the pristine pGe and functionalized
pGe nanostructures, respectively. As clearly shown in Figure 2a, the average values of the
total energies of the pGe sheet at 300 and 500 K are decreased. As
a consequence, its final nanostructure has been broken almost completely
after a period of 2.5 ps. In contrast, the functionalized pGe sheets
are found to sustain their integrated nanostructures during the AIMD
simulations at 300 and 500 K. The observed total energy fluctuations
of both hydrogenated and fluorinated pGes are almost zero, as evidenced
by the zoomed insets in Figure 2b,c. Furthermore, it is noted that the total energy fluctuations
of the hydrogenated and fluorinated pentagraphenes at room temperature
are much larger than those of the corresponding functionalized pGe
cases,30 indicating that the functionalized
pGe could be energetically more favorable. Taking the calculated results
shown above into account, hydrogenation and fluorination of 2D pGe
sheets lead to not only dynamical stability but also thermal stability
at room temperature and even at a temperature of 500 K. Next, we will
focus on the electronic structures of the hydrogenated and fluorinated
pGes, and the electronic properties of the pristine pGe will not be
considered because of its dynamically unstable nanostructure.

the AIMD simulations of the structures of (a) pGe,
(b) H–pGe–H, and (c) F–pGe–F sheets at
300 and 500 K at the end of simulation. The zoomed figures of the
total energy fluctuations at different temperatures are shown in each
inset.

The calculated electronic structures
and the corresponding partial
density of states (PDOSs)
of the hydrogenated and fluorinated pGes are shown in Figure 3. Clearly, H–pGe–H
is a semiconductor with an indirect band gap of 1.92 eV at Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof
(PBE) level. Its valence bond maximum (VBM) is located at the M-point,
and its conducting bond minimum (CBM) is located at about 1/2 along
the Γ – M path in the momentum space.
This feature is different from that of the hydrogenated pentasilicene29 and hydrogenated pentagraphene,30 whose CBMs are located at the Γ-point. The underestimation
of electronic band gap in the framework of PBE functional is well-known;
thus, we have carried out Heyd–Scuseria–Ernzerhof (HSE)06
functional calculations to obtain more accurate results. The electronic
structures obtained by PBE and HSE06 are analogous, whereas HSE06
gives significant modification on band gap to 2.60 eV, showing that
hydrogenation can tune the electronic structure of pGe from metal
to semiconductor. Furthermore, we found that both PBE and HSE06 band
gaps are approximately 1 eV larger than the corresponding value for
germanane.32,51 On the basis of the analysis
of charge density distribution, as shown in Figure 3a, the VBM of H–pGe–H is mainly
contributed by the Ge2–Ge1 bonding state and partially by the
Ge2–Ge2 bonding state, indicating the σpp characters.
In contrast, its CBM is composed of the Ge2–H antibonding state,
indicating the σsp* characters.

PBE and
HSE06 functionals and the PDOSs of (a) H–pGe–H
and (b) F–pGe–F. Isosurface plots of the band-decomposed
charge density distributions corresponding to VBM and CBM are displayed
on the right side of the PDOS result. The isovalue is 0.0085e/b3. The Fermi level is set to zero and indicated by the gray
dashed line.

For the fluorinated pGe,
it is also an indirect band gap semiconductor.
The band structure calculation at PBE level reports a band gap of
1.39 eV, and the HSE06-calculated
result is essentially identical to the PBE one, except for the increased
band gap of 2.09 eV. The electronic structures of H–pGe–H
and F–pGe–F shown in Figure 3 are very similar. However, hydrogenated
and fluorinated decorations in pGe give rise to distinct influences
on the characters of VBM and CBM states. For instance, the charge
density of F–pGe–F reveals that both Ge and F atoms
have significant contributions to the VBM state, which is verified
by the PDOS result, and its CBM state is originated from strong covalent
bonds formed between Ge2 and F atoms. The differences between the
PDOSs of hydrogenated and fluorinated decorations are attributed to
the considerably different electronegativities of the adatoms. The
electronegativity is increased from H to Ge and F atoms. The Ge2 atoms
are regarded as acceptors in the hydrogenated case of H–pGe–H
nanostructure, whereas these become donors in the fluorinated case
of F–pGe–F nanostructure. More importantly, the characters
of VBM and CBM states, arising from different chemical functionalizations,
can be modified by external tensile strains.

The external strain
has been widely used to tune the electronic
structure and thermal properties of materials,52 and previous studies have shown that a topologically nontrivial
phase can be achieved in the Ge-based 2D nanomaterials by tensile
strain.49 Thus, we investigate the effects
of biaxial strain on the electronic structures of hydrogenated and
fluorinated pGes and hope that the indirect–direct band gap
transition can be obtained for these functionalized pGes by tensile
strain. In this study, the biaxial strain is stimulated by varying
the in-plane lattice to a series of values, which are larger/smaller
than those of the equilibrium structure. The strain imposed on the
structure is defined as ε = (a – a0)/a0, where a0 and a denote the lattice
constants of the unstained and strained systems, respectively. Considering
that the differences in the electronic structures obtained by PBE
and HSE06 are concentrated
on band gap values, we calculate the electronic structures at PBE
level, as shown in Figure 4. Correspondingly, the HSE06 band gap values can be roughly
estimated by scissor operation.

(c) the hydrogenated pGe and (f) the fluorinated pGe, confirming that
the unstrained nanostructure corresponds to the lowest total energy.
Band structures based on the PBE functional under certain external
tensile strains are listed in the figures.

As explicitly shown in Figure 4a, a direct band gap at the M-point can be obtained
for the H–pGe–H 2D sheet when ε = 6% biaxial strain
is applied. The presence of the indirect–direct semiconductor
transition is favorable for its potential applications, and this phenomenon
can be understood from the charge transfer between Ge2 and Ge1 atoms.
In detail, once a tensile stretch
is applied on the nanostructure, the Ge1–Ge2 bond length is
increased from 2.479 to 2.553 Å when ε = 6% and the buckling
distance (h) is also monotonously decreased. As a
result, Ge1 has superior electronegativity compared to that of the
Ge2 atoms and charge transfers from Ge2 to Ge1 atoms, which is confirmed
by its CBM charge density and PDOS results shown in Figure S1. As the tensile stretch increased monotonously,
the Ge1 atom’s induced energy level with the σpp* character is
shifted downward at the M-point and the Ge2 atom’s induced
energy level (at 1/2 of M−Γ path) with the σsp* character is
shifted upward. Once the critical strain of ε = 6% is achieved,
the σpp*-characterized state eventually becomes CBM to replace the original
σsp* state,
leading to the indirect–direct transition for the hydrogenated
pGe. Generally, the band gap of H–pGe–H is decreased
in a linear way with a continuous increase in stretch strain. When
a compressing tensile is applied, conversely, the σpp*-characterized
level is shifted upward and the σpp*-characterized one is shifted downward.
As a consequence, the indirect band gap is reduced as a compressing
strain is exerted on the H–pGe–H nanosheet, as shown
in Figure 4b. For the
2D H–pGe–H nanosheet, it is interesting to find that
not only its band gap can be tuned in a wide range of 1.25–1.92
eV (1.95–2.62 eV at HSE06 level according to scissor operation),
but also the indirect to direct band gap transition can be obtained
for this semiconductor. Most importantly, the strain range calculated
in our study is generally achievable for experimental realization.53 For instance, the 2D MoS2 nanomaterial
can be subjected to an external strain of 11%.54 Specifically, we noticed that the lattice constant of the
zinc blende MgSe film is 5.89 Å, which can be served as a substrate
for applying the epitaxial strain by molecular beam epitaxy.55 Owing to the interaction between the film and
the substrate via the weak van der Waals interactions, the biaxially
strained H–pGe–H with ε = 6% can be realized similar
to the 2D sheet grown on the BN substrate.50,56 Therefore, the hydrogenated pGe is expected to have practical applications
in the field of nanoelectronics.

However, in the case of fluorinated
pGe, we found that the indirect
band gap character is maintained at the tensile range of ε =
−8 to 10%. The absence of the indirect–direct band gap
transition, in sharp contrast to that in H–pGe–H, is
attributed to the high electronegativity of the fluorine atoms. The
electronic structure evolutions of F–pGe–F under stretch
strain can be described in the following steps: (1) At equilibrium
position, its indirect band gap is determined by the σpp-characterized VBM at the M-point and the σpp*-characterized CBM at about 2/5
of the M−Γ path. (2) As a small stretch strain (ε
= 2%) is applied, the σpp*-characterized CBM is shifted upward. We stress
that the σpp*-characterized CBM is robust to the biaxial strain because
the F atoms always serve as acceptors and the Ge2 atoms here are donors.
The external tensile strain, including both stretch and compressing,
can effectively tune the Ge1–Ge2 coupling, whereas the σpp*-featured CBM
is less influenced and only relative shift is observed, as shown in Figure S2b. Meanwhile, the Ge1 atom’s
induced energy level at the X-point is lifted toward the Fermi level,
which is due to the increasing charge density around the Ge1 atoms.
(3) When the stretch strain is further increased, the σpp* state governed
by the Ge1 atoms becomes the VBM as ε = 4% is satisfied, leading
to the change in VBM location. This phenomenon can also be understood
from the significant increase in the calculated PDOSs of the Ge1 atoms,
as demonstrated in Figure S2. Thus, the
indirect band gap is determined by the VBM at the X-point and the
CBM located at the M−Γ path. (4) As the stretch strain
is further increased (ε > 4%), the VBM at the X-point is
found
to be more pronouncedly influenced, in contrast to the robust CBM.
Therefore, the band gap is reduced with increasing biaxial strain.
Additionally, the zinc blende CdSe with lattice constant a = 6.05 Å can be a potential substrate for the experimental
realization of ε = 6% strain.57 On
the other hand, when the nanosheet is subjected to a compressing strain,
its CBM is influenced and moves toward the Fermi level. The band gap
of F–pGe–F is found to monotonously decreased, as shown
in Figure 4e. Overall,
the electronic structure of F–pGe–F is shown to be effectively
modulated by the external strain.

Furthermore, we have considered
that the tetracoordinated Ge atoms
are likely to be substituted by other group-IV elemental atoms. The
aim is to understand the influences of incorporation of C/Si/Sn/Pb
substitutional atoms on the pGe structure and its electronic structures.
For simplicity, we focus only on the hydrogenated pGe with substitutional
doping, and the two Ge1 atoms are replaced by the C, Si, Sn, and Pb
atoms, respectively. Hence, the four doped configurations, as schematically
shown in Figure 5,
are represented as H–pGe–C–H, H–pGe–Si–H,
H–pGe–Sn–H, and H–pGe–Pb–H.
These four doped H–pGe–H nanostructures are optimized,
at first, with their structural parameters summarized in the Table 2, and the corresponding
electronic structures are then calculated to assess the effects of
various dopings. In addition, it is found that the symmetry of the
doped nanostructures is still preserved (space group no. 113). From
the viewpoint of energy in terms of Eb, the four substitutional dopings are all energetically favorable.
Moreover, the lattice constant (a), the Ge2–X
bond length (R1), and the buckling distance
(h) increased as the atomic number increased from
C to Pb. Correspondingly, the σpp*-featured CBM substantially reduced as R1 increased from C to Pb, and eventually, it
almost vanished for Pb doping.
The band gaps of the doped system can be varied in a wide range (1.16–4.35
eV by hybrid functional calculation), as shown in Figure 5, and Si, Sn, and Pb dopings
give rise to high electron mobility at the M-point. In addition, it
is worth mentioning that the electronic bands along the M−Γ
path are doubly degenerate as a result of symmetry protection by the
space group. This double degeneracy can be broken by semidoping, that
is, only one Ge1 atom is replaced by the C atom, and the expected
results have been confirmed by our calculation shown in Figure S3b. Thus, the substitutional dopings
can be utilized to modulate the electronic structures of the H–pGe–H
2D sheet.

Conclusions
In summary, we use first-principles
calculations to study the structural
stability and electronic properties of the pGe modulated by chemical
functionalization. Although the pristine 2D pGe is energetically unfavorable,
the functionalized pGes decorated by hydrogenation and fluorination
are found to be dynamically and thermally stable. We have shown that
the hydrogenated and fluorinated pGes are stable even at a high temperature
of 500 K. Both hydrogenated and fluorinated-pentagonal germanenes
are semiconductors with indirect band gaps of 1.92 and 1.39 eV (2.60
and 2.09 eV by the HSE06 functional), respectively. The electronic
structures of the functionalized pGes can be effectively modulated
by biaxial tensile strain. More importantly, our calculations reveal
that the indirect to direct band gap transition can be achieved for
the hydrogenated pGe sheet by 6% biaxial strain. Furthermore, we show
that the band gap of H–pGe–H can be further tailored
from 1.16 to 4.35 eV by heteroatom doping (C/Si/Sn/Pb). Therefore,
the chemically functionalized pGes are expected to possess robust
structural stability and excellent electronic properties, allowing
Ge-based 2D nanosheets to have many potential applications in the
future.

Computational Methods and Models
The first-principles
calculations within density functional theory
are utilized in the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP).58,59 Projector-augmented wave pseudopotentials in the form of the PBE
functional are used for electronic exchange-correlation potential.60 The electronic wave functions of valence electrons
are expanded using plane-wave basis sets with a cutoff energy of 500
eV. For structural optimizations, the exchange-correlation potential
is described by the generalized gradient approximation. The PBE functional
is used in most of our calculations,60 and
the hybrid HSE06 functional is also employed for more accurate electronic
structure calculations.61,62 The convergence criteria
for total energy and force component are set to be 10–6 eV and 0.001 eV/Å. A vacuum layer of 30 Å is set in the
plane normal direction to minimize image interactions. The Monkhorst–Pack
set of 25 × 25 × 1 k-points for the 2D structures is used
to sample the BZ for the geometry optimization, and a denser grid
of 31 × 31 × 1 is used for electronic structure computations.63 The phonon dispersions are calculated by density
functional perturbation theory (DFPT) as implemented in the CASTEP
code.64,65 All AIMD simulations are performed
in the canonical (NVT) ensemble via the VASP code. The temperature
is controlled by the Nosé–Hoover algorithm at 300 and
500 K.66 The equations of motion are integrated
using the velocity Verlet algorithm.
