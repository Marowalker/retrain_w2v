The
glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor (GLP-1R) belongs to the pharmaceutically
important class B family of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), and
its incretin peptide ligand GLP-1 analogs are adopted drugs for the
treatment of type 2 diabetes. Despite remarkable antidiabetic effects,
GLP-1 peptide-based drugs are limited by the need of injection. On
the other hand, developing nonpeptidic small-molecule drugs targeting
GLP-1R remains elusive. Here, we first constructed a three-dimensional
structure model of the transmembrane (TM) domain of human GLP-1R using
homology modeling and conformational sampling techniques. Next, a
potential allosteric binding site on the TM domain was predicted computationally.
In silico screening of druglike compounds against this predicted allosteric
site has identified nine compounds as potential GLP-1R agonists. The
independent agonistic activity of two compounds was subsequently confirmed
using a cAMP response element-based luciferase reporting system. One
compound was also shown to stimulate insulin secretion through in
vitro assay. In addition, this compound synergized with GLP-1 to activate
human GLP-1R. These results demonstrated that allosteric regulation
potentially exists in GLP-1R and can be exploited for developing small-molecule
agonists. The success of this work will help pave the way for small-molecule
drug discovery targeting other class B GPCRs through allosteric regulations.

Introduction
In the past 40 years,
the number of overweight people has increased
sixfold worldwide with 33.6% of US men and women being obese, and
this disturbing trend is projected to continue in the foreseeable
future.1 Obesity can cause a number of
health problems including cardiovascular diseases and diabetes, with
type 2 diabetes representing 90–95% of diabetes patients. The
glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor (GLP-1R), a member of class B family
of G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), is an effective target for
the treatment of type 2 diabetes,2 and
its incretin peptide and varied peptide mimetics are adopted drugs.3

Despite remarkable antidiabetic effects,
GLP-1 peptide-based agonists
have several shortcomings.4,5 They are available only
in a format for injection, lacking effective long-term glucose control
capability, and they can cause side effects and result in low quality
of life in some patients. Hence, there is significant interest in
the development of nonpeptidic small-molecule agonists of GLP-1R with
enhanced bioavailability.6−11 However, such a strategy remains problematic because of the nature
of the orthosteric binding site for GLP-1 (Figure 1A), which is large and relatively shallow.12 Up to now, no small-molecule drugs acting as
GLP-1R agonists are available in the market. Therefore, novel approaches
in developing small-molecule drugs targeting GLP-1R are very desirable
for the treatment of type 2 diabetes.

binding sites for class
B GPCRs. (A) Orthosteric binding site of an endogenous peptide illustrated
by the cryo-EM structure of GLP-1R (PDB ID: 5VAI). (B) Allosteric
binding site of a small-molecule ligand illustrated by the crystal
structure of CRF-1R (PDB ID: 4K5Y). The peptide and small-molecule ligands (colored
in pink) were represented in a CPK model. For clarity, only the TM
domain of the receptors was shown.

Given the allosteric nature of GPCRs, targeting the allosteric
sites on GPCRs for small-molecule therapeutic intervention represents
an alternative and promising approach for drug discovery.13−16 Cinacalcet, a positive allosteric modulator of the calcium sensing
receptor17 and Maraviroc, a negative allosteric
modulator of the chemokine receptor CCR5,18 are the first two allosteric drugs of GPCRs entering the market.
Compared to ligands acting at orthosteric sites, allosteric ligands
demonstrate several potential benefits, including better subtype selectivity
and reduced side effects,19,20 as well as biased functional
selectivity and novel modes of efficacy.15,21 In addition, allosteric agonists may benefit the development of
orally delivered peptide drugs targeting the orthosteric site by augmenting
the efficacy of endogenous and exogenous peptide and its analogs.
Recently, the existence of the allosteric site for class B GPCRs was
confirmed by the reported crystal structure of the corticotropin-releasing
factor receptor 1 (CRF-1R),22 which showed
an antagonist binding at an allosteric site deep inside the transmembrane
(TM) domain of the receptor (Figure 1B). Hence, targeting the allosteric sites of GLP-1R
for small-molecule drug discovery could represent a promising alternative
for overcoming shortcomings related to GLP-1 peptide-based treatment.

High-throughput screenings have identified a few small-molecule
allosteric agonists binding to the TM domain of GLP-1R, with some
in covalent modification, for example, compound 2 and BETP.6−8 However, the lack of a high-quality structure of the TM domain of
GLP-1R until very recently23−25 hindered further development
of these lead compounds into drugs. In this work, we first performed
homology modeling and conformational sampling to generate a three-dimensional
(3D) structure model of the TM domain of GLP-1R. Then, we applied
the rational ligand-based and structure-based drug design techniques
to screen the ZINC database26 for identification
of druglike small-molecule as allosteric agonists of GLP-1R. Finally,
the agonistic and allosteric effects of the top-ranked compounds were
studied using a cAMP response element (CRE)-based luciferase reporting
system and insulin assay. These results confirmed that allosteric
regulation exists in GLP-1R and can be exploited for developing small-molecule
agonists of GLP-1R.

Results
3D Model of TM Domain of
GLP-1R
Two homology models
of the TM domain of GLP-1R were constructed, one based on the template
structure of CRF-1R (PDB ID: 4K5Y) and the other based on that of the glucagon receptor
(GCGR) (PDB ID: 4L6R). Both models were then subjected to the primary enrichments. Results
from preliminary enrichment studies indicated that the GLP-1R model
built based on the CRF-1R structure showed better enrichment for the
23 GLP-1R ligands. Therefore, this GLP-1R model was selected for subsequent
conformational sampling calculations.

Hundred conformations
of the TM domain of GLP-1R were generated through conformational sampling
calculations (Figure 2). Among them, 10 distinct conformations were identified. For each
of the 10 GLP-1R models, the ROC plot was generated. The best enrichment
results were obtained for the Conformation #8 (Figure S1 online). About 70% of the 23 active compounds were
present in the top 30% of the docking results. Therefore, Conformation
#8 was selected for the virtual screening process.

conformations of the TM domain of GLP-1R

Small-Molecule Agonists of GLP-1R Identified through in Silico
Screening
For ligand-based screening, the 23 active compounds
from PubChem30 were used as the query individually
to identify similar compounds in the small-molecule library of ZINC
database.26 A total of 5689 compounds that
had similar ligand properties (molecular weight, x log P, hydrogen donors, hydrogen acceptor and polar
surface area) with the 23 active compounds were identified. Next,
those 5689 compounds were docked into the same predicted allosteric
site of Conformation #8 respectively using Glide. Glide in the Schrodinger
Suite is one of the best docking tools to identify potential protein
effectors.53 Each dock pose was then ranked
based on its glide and docking scores. Top-ranked poses were visually
inspected and they all bound to the proposed allosteric site in the
TM domain (Figure 3). Nine top-ranked compounds were identified and eight of them were
purchased and experimentally tested for their potential activity against
GLP-1R (Table 1).

In Vitro Activity of the Top-Ranked Compounds
In vitro
activity of the eight top-ranked compounds (Table 1) from virtual screening was first studied
using the GLP-1R-dependent luciferase reporter system. In this screening
system, the rat GLP-1R plasmid was transiently transfected in HEK293
cells, stably expressing luciferase reporter gene (HEK-CREB luciferase).
The sequence identity between human GLP-1R and rat GLP-1R is ∼90%,
and there is no difference in the predicted allosteric site between
the two sequences. Hence, the rat GLP-1R was chosen for screening
compounds. The activation of the rat GLP-1R was measured as the amount
of luminescence in response to cAMP, which in turn was normalized
to the amount of protein. The relative luminescence change at each
concentration of compound was calculated with respect to the vehicle
control. These readings were used to plot the dose–response
curves. Three independent experiments were performed for each compound,
and negative control was included in all experiments to evaluate nonspecific
effect of compounds (if any). From in vitro screening, two compounds
(M_4 and M_9) were found to activate GLP-1R.
The EC50 value of compounds M_4 and M_9 was 24 and 26 μM, respectively (Figure 4A,B).

HEK293 cells coexpressing GLP-1R or VIPR1 receptor and a 3x-CRE-luciferase
reporter. (A) Dose–response curves of compound M_4 in the presence and absence of rat GLP-1R, respectively. (EC50 = 24 μM). HEK293-CREBluciferase cell line transiently
expressing rat GLP-1R was treated with different concentrations of M_4. GLP-1R activation was measured as the amount of luminescence
produced, which was normalized by protein concentration; (B) dose–response
curves of compound M_9 in the presence and absence of
rat GLP-1R, respectively. (EC50 = 26 μM). The HEK293-CREB
luciferase cell line transiently expressing rat GLP-1R was treated
with different concentrations of M_9. GLP-1R activation
was measured as the amount of luminescence produced, which was normalized
by protein concentration; (C) effect of GLP-1R agonist M_4 in the presence or absence of the VIPR peptide antagonist. The HEK293-CREB
luciferase cell line was treated with different concentrations of M_4 in the presence or absence of the VIPR peptide antagonist
(5.6 μM). The nonspecific effect of M_4 was measured
as the amount of luminescence produced, which was normalized by protein
concentration. In all experiments, normalized luminescence was plotted
with respect to vehicle control [0.5% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)].
For (A,B), the dose–response curve plotted for negative control
showed some nonspecific effect. The difference between dose–response
curves for HEK293-CREB luciferase cells with and without GLP-1R was
significant (p < 0.0001). The dose–response
curves were generated using a sigmoidal dose response (variable slope)
from GraphPad Prism 6.0. Data in all three figures are representative
of three independent experiments with at least three technical replicates
for each treatment conditions, and error bars for each concentration
were plotted as standard error of the mean (SEM; n = 3).

Besides GLP-1R, the HEK293 cells
are known to express other functional
class B GPCRs including vasoactive intestinal peptide receptor 1 (VIPR1).48 Sequence alignment of residues in the predicted
allosteric binding site showed high sequence identity between human
GLP-1R and some of these class B receptors (Figure S2 online), implicating that compounds M_4 and M_9 could bind to other class B GPCRs. Therefore, the nonspecific
luciferase activity by these two compounds was studied using HEK293-CREB
luciferase cells transiently transfected with an empty vector. The
results indicated that these compounds only exhibited limited nonspecific
effect on HEK-CREB cells (Figure 4A,B).

Nonspecific stimulation of VIPR1 by compounds M_4 and M_9 could lead to side effects. To further
assess this effect,
the optimal concentration of a VIPR peptide antagonist that would
inhibit VIPR1 activation present on HEK293_CREB cells in the presence
of the VIPR peptide agonist was estimated (Figure S3 online). Then, the effect of M_4 on VIPR1 stimulation
was studied in the presence or absence of the VIPR peptide antagonist.
By comparing the changes of luciferase activity in the absence and
presence of the VIPR peptide antagonist, the data indicated that M_4 slightly induced nonspecific VIPR1 activity (Figure 4C).

Compound M_4
Synergizes with GLP-1 To Activate Human GLP-1R
Low levels38 and a decreased response
of GLP-1 have been observed in some type 2 patients.39−42 Therefore, it will be of interest to determine whether compounds M_4 and M_9 can act as an allosteric modulator
of GLP-1R and enhance the bioactivity of endogenous GLP-1. The activation
of GLP-1R by M_4 (24.71 μM) in combination with
different concentrations of GLP-1 (0.014–1450 nM) was studied
by luciferase activity responding to cAMP production using HEK293-CREB
cells transiently expressing human GLP-1R. GLP-1R activity stimulated
by GLP-1 in combination with M_4 (24.71 μM) was
significantly increased than by using GLP-1 alone, and the synergistic
effect was found to be dose-dependent (Figure 5A). This synergistic activity suggested that M_4 might act as an allosteric modulator of human GLP-1R.

receptor. (A) Synergistic effect of M_4 in the presence

the presence of VIP on VIPR1; GLP-1R and VIPR1 activation were assessed
as luminescence normalized to protein concentration and plotted as
luminescence fold change with respect to vehicle control (0.5% DMSO).
Data are the average of three independent experiments with at least
three technical replicates for each conditions, and error bars for
each concentration were plotted as SEM (n = 3). Statistical
analysis was done using 2-way ANOVA (****p < 0.0001;
**p < 0.001).

Given the nonspecific effect of M_4 on VIPR1
present
on the HEK293-CREB cell line (Figure 4C), it was necessary to examine the behavior of M_4 (24.71 μM) on VIPR1 in the presence of VIP (7.5–7510
nM), using the same cell line with overexpressed VIPR1. Only at the
high VIP concentration, VIPR1 activity in response to VIP in combination
with M_4 was higher than using VIP alone, indicating
the potential nonspecific activity of M_4 on VIPR1 (Figure 5B). However, the
amplitude of such a synergistic effect of M_4 was significantly
lower than when M_4 was used with a broad range of GLP-1,
suggesting that M_4 significantly improved the GLP-1R-mediated
cAMP production compared with the VIPR1-mediated cAMP production.
Overall, M_4 synergizes well with GLP-1 to stimulate
GLP-1R activity, potentially by acting as an allosteric modulator
of GLP-1R. Further work is certainly required to prove that M_4 acts on the allosteric site of GLP-1R.

M_4 Stimulates Insulin Secretion
The goal
of this work is to develop small-molecule agonists of GLP-1R that
will stimulate insulin production in pancreatic β cells. The
insulin production activity of M_4 was assessed by in
vitro insulin secretion assay in INS-1832/13 cells. For the assay,
INS-1 832/13 cells were first starved with Krebs Ringer Bicarbonate
(KRB) buffer. After starvation, cells were treated with KRB containing
glucose (16.7 mM) and GLP-1 (181 nM) or M_4 (20 μM)
for 10–20 min. After the treatment, the amount of insulin production
was assessed using the insulin detection ELISA kit. The results indicated
that like GLP-1, GLP-1R agonist M_4 can stimulate insulin
secretion in the presence of 16.7 mM of glucose, and the insulin production
by GLP-1 and M_4 was more than twofold compared to vehicle
control at both time points (Figure 6). In addition, no significant difference was observed
between the amount of insulin produced by GLP-1 and M_4. These data indicated that M_4 can induce glucose-dependent
insulin production in GLP-1R expressed cells and might act as a real
GLP-1R agonist with potential clinical application.

832/13 cells. INS-1 832/13 cells were treated with GLP-1 (181 nM)
and M_4 (20 μM) in the presence of 16.7 mM glucose after 2 h
of starvation with KRB buffer. Data are the average of three independent
experiments, and error bars for each concentration were plotted as
SEM (n = 3). Statistical analysis was done using
two-way ANOVA (**p < 0.01). The comparison was
done with respect to the amount of insulin produced in the corresponding
vehicle control (DMSO 0.125%).

Homology Model of GLP-1R Showed Characteristics of an Active
Conformation
When this project was first started several
years ago, there was no experimentally determined structure available
for the TM domain of GLP-1R. In 2017, a cryo-EM structure of the rabbit
GLP-1R in its active conformation (PDB ID: 5VAI) and a crystal structure of human GLP-1R
in its inactive conformation (PDB ID: 5VEX) were reported.24,25 Comparison of both the backbone atoms and the predicted allosteric
binding site among these two structures and the homology model generated
above suggested that the homology model used for in silico screening
is different from both the inactive and the active structure reported
(Table 2). Consistently,
docking compounds M_4 and M_9 into the same
predicted allosteric site of the reported active structure (PDB ID: 5VAI) respectively showed
worse binding for either compound with the best docking score of about
−4.8 kcal/mol.

Interestingly,
although the homology model is more similar to the
inactive structure overall, it showed certain characteristics of an
active conformation. The root-mean-square deviation (rmsd) of the
predicted binding site between the homology model and the reported
active structure is less than that between the active structure and
the inactive structure. Further, a highly conserved interhelix interaction
network (H1802.50 E2473.50 T3536.42 Y4027.57)44 in class B GPCRs,
that includes the conserved ionic lock between H1802.50 and E2473.50, and which is widely regarded to help maintain
the inactive conformation of GLP-1R25 (Figure 7A), was disrupted
in both the active structure (Figure 7B) and the homology model (Figure 7C). In the active structure, the ionic lock
between H1802.50 and E2473.50 was broken and
T3536.42 moved far away from the rest of the residues in
the network; while in the model, the same ionic lock was partially
broken and T3536.42 also moved far away.

Discussion
Type
2 diabetes and the underlying obesity is becoming a worldwide
threat to human health. GLP-1R is an effective target for treatment
of type 2 diabetes, and the development of small-molecule agonists
will offer several potential benefits and help overcome problems associated
with GLP-1 peptide drugs.15,19−21 However, targeting the orthosteric site in GLP-1R for small-molecule
discovery is ineffective because of the nature of the orthosteric
binding site, which is large and relatively shallow.12 An alternative and potentially promising approach is to
target the allosteric sites on GLP-1R instead.

A major hurdle
in following this approach is the lack of 3D structure
information for the TM domain of GLP-1R until very recently.23−25 Past small-molecule drug discovery efforts were often carried out
by high-throughput screening.6−8 In this work, we attempted to
take the rational design approach by constructing a 3D model of the
TM domain of GLP-1R in its active conformation through the combination
of homology modeling, conformation sampling, and enrichment studies.
First, the standard homology models of the TM domain of GLP-1R were
constructed using Modeller;29 second, enrichment
studies were carried out to identify the better homology model; third,
conformation sampling was performed using ProDy;34 and finally, further enrichment studies were done to identify
the best conformation for ligand screening. This approach is similar
to the previously reported approach.43

The construction of the structural model of the TM domain of GLP-1R
enabled us to apply the rational structure-based drug design techniques
along with ligand-based design techniques to the discovery of small-molecule,
allosteric agonists of GLP-1R. Employing the 3D model generated and
performing in silico ligand-based and structure-based screening, we
have identified nine compounds as potential agonists of GLP-1R for
the experimental test. Two of them were confirmed as intrinsic agonists
of GLP-1R by in vitro activity assay. Further studies showed that
one of the two active compounds (M_4) exerted a synergistic
effect on the activity of GLP-1 against GLP-1R in a dose-dependent
manner (Figure 5A),
suggesting that it does not compete with GLP-1 in binding to the orthosteric
site on GLP-1R. This is consistent with our docking results that indicated
that both bound at the allosteric site on the TM domain (Figure 3). Together, these
data showed that compound M_4 likely functions as a positive
allosteric modulator agonist, although further experimental confirmation
is needed.

These small-molecule agonists we identified are structurally
and
chemically different from those reported in the literature.6−11 Hence, they represent novel allosteric agonists of GLP-1R. The two
ligands (M_4 and M_9) were also found to
induce agonistic activities in the absence of GLP-1R expression (Figure 4A,B). Given the high
sequence similarity between GLP-1R and other class B GPCRs, for example,
VIPR1 (Figure S2 online), this nonspecific
effect is not unexpected. Because HEK293 cells are known to express
the functional VIPR1 and undesired stimulation of this receptor could
lead to numerous side effects, the nonspecific effect of M_4 on VIPR1 was studied. The data indicated that M_4 slightly
induced nonspecific VIPR1 activity (Figure 4C) and when combined with high concentration
of VIPR peptide agonist, M_4 also demonstrated a synergistic
effect (Figure 5B),
though the amplitude of such an effect was much lower than when M_4 was used with a broad range of GLP-1 (Figure 5A). Overall, despite the limited
activity of VIPR1 induced by M_4, given the high sequence
identity of the proposed binding site between GLP-1R and some other
Class B GPCRs (Figure S2 online), work
is in place to chemically modify compound M_4 in order
to increase its potency and improve its specificity to GLP-1R. On
the other hand, dual and triple agonists targeting GLP-1R along with
other class B GPCRs have been demonstrated with increased therapeutic
benefit recently.45,46 It could also be of interest
to explore the potential of compound M_4 as a dual or
triple agonist.

The experimental structures of the TM domain
of GLP-1R were finally
reported in the year of 2017.23−25 Comparison of the experimental
structures with the homology model generated in this work indicated
that the homology model is quite different from the reported active
structure and is more similar to the inactive structure overall (Table 2). On the other hand,
using the homology model for in silico screening, small-molecule agonists
were indeed identified and one of them can induce insulin secretion
in INS-1 832/13 cells.

To some extent, this apparent discrepancy
is understandable. The
backbone atom rmsd between the reported inactive and active structures
is ∼3.6 Å, suggesting quite a significant difference between
them. On the other hand, the homology model was constructed based
on another inactive structure. Although conformational sampling was
carried out using the ProDy software package, it was based on the
simple anisotropic network model (ANM) and only 20 ANM models were
generated. With such limited sampling, only a small fraction of the
entire conformational space could be explored. Given the significant
difference between the inactive and active structures, the resulted
model would likely remain more similar to the inactive structure of
GLP-1R. This is indeed the case observed here. The rmsd of the predicted
binding site between the homology model and the reported active structure
is ∼3.3 Å, greater than that between the homology model
and the inactive structure.

On the other hand, the homology
model has shown certain characteristics
of an active conformation such as partial disruption of the conserved
interaction network (H1802.50 E2473.50 T3536.42 Y4027.57).44 Consistently,
the rmsd of the predicted binding site between the homology model
and the reported active structure is less than that between the active
structure and the inactive structure. Considering the fact that a
GLP-1R can adopt multiple conformations,6 the homology model reported here, though different from the reported
active structure overall, could be much similar to another active
conformation, and this may help explain its success in identifying
agonists reported in this work.

The development and characterization
of small-molecule allosteric
agonists of GLP-1R using the rational structural model-based approach
as proposed here will also help with the small-molecule drug discovery
of other members of the pharmaceutical important class B family of
GPCRs, in particular those whose structure is not available yet. All
of the natural ligands for the class B GPCRs are moderately long linear
peptide hormones whose binding site on the receptors is similar to
that of GLP-1R. Because of the nature of these binding sites, small-molecule
discovery targeting them remains a general challenge.47 The existence of the allosteric site for class B GPCRs
was confirmed by the reported crystal structure of CRF-1R, which showed
an antagonist binding at an allosteric site deep inside the TM domain
of the receptor.22 By targeting the same
allosteric site on GLP-1R using our modeling approach and structure-based
drug design techniques for the development of small-molecule agonists,
this work demonstrates the feasibility for small-molecule drug discovery
targeting other class B GPCRs through allosteric regulations.

Methods
The proposed method includes several steps (Figure 8): (i) structural modeling of GLP-1R; (ii)
in silico ligand-based and structure-based ligand screening; and (iii)
experimental validation of the agonistic effects of the identified
small-molecule compounds.

Figure 8 Flowchart of the homology modeling and molecule
screening procedure.

Structural Modeling of GLP-1R
The 3D structure model
of the TM domain of GLP-1R was generated in several steps (Figure 8). In 2013, two crystal
structures of class B GPCRs were reported, one for the CRF-1R (PDB
ID: 4K5Y)22 and the other for the glucagon receptor (GCGR)
(PDB ID: 4L6R).27 GLP-1R has the sequence identity
of ∼33% with CRF-1R and ∼54% with GCGR. Hence, both
were suitable as templates for the homology modeling of GLP-1R and
both were adopted for the initial homology modeling. To construct
the homology model based on either template, the GLP-1R sequence and
the template structure were imported in MOE (Molecular Computing Group
Inc., version 2011.10), and all hetero atoms, lysozyme, and water
molecules were deleted. Structure-based alignment was then carried
out in MOE. The alignment results were confirmed with the alignments
provided by the GPCRdb database.28 The
homology model based on either template was generated using Modeller
(version 9.14)29 based on the MOE alignment.
Models of the GLP-1R based on either template were then subjected
to the primary enrichment studies.

To carry out primary enrichment
studies, 23 active compounds identified as GLP-1R agonists were downloaded
from the PubChem BioAssay database30 (PubChem
AID: 624172). For each of the 23 compounds, 36 structurally similar,
inactive compounds (decoys) were also identified using the DecoyFinder
tool (http://urvnutrigenomica-ctns.github.io/DecoyFinder/) with druglike
settings.

These active and decoy compounds were then prepared
for docking
using Ligand Preparation wizard of the Schrodinger Suite (version
2014-2).31 Homology models generated above
were prepared in Protein Preparation wizard with default settings.
For the GLP-1R model based on the CRF-1R structure, the compound binding
site was predicted using the Sitemap tool32 and further confirmed based on the co-crystalized antagonist binding
site on the CRF-1R structure, while for the model based on the GCGR
structure, the binding site was predicted using the Sitemap tool.32 Docking calculations were carried out using
the Glide SP settings.33 Knime (version
2.9.2) was used to automate ensemble docking calculations. The enrichment
calculator script provided by Schrodinger was used to calculate the
enrichment factor and to generate the ROC plots. Results from preliminary
enrichment studies was used to identify the better model for further
conformational sampling.

Conformational sampling was carried
out using the ProDy library.34 Twenty ANM
models based on the coarse-grained
C-alpha atom were first generated starting with the better homology
model identified above, and then extended to the full-atom model.
From these 20 models, 100 conformations were generated and optimized
using NAMD.35 From these 100 conformations,
10 conformations differing by an rmsd of at least 1.5 Å from
the average rmsd model were selected for further enrichment studies
using the same enrichments protocol described above. For each of the
10 GLP-1R models, ROC plots were again generated. The conformation
with the best enrichment results was selected for the virtual screening
process.

In Silico Screening by Ligand-Based and Structure-Based Approaches
For the initial screening, the 23 active compounds from PubChem30 were used as the query individually to identify
similar compounds in the small-molecule library of ZINC database26 through the Shape Signatures approach.36 Using this approach, a chemical library can
be rapidly scanned for likely matches to a compound. The ZINC database
of commercially available druglike molecules is currently in excess
of 21 × 106 diverse molecules. Top-ranked compounds
that had similar ligand properties (molecular weight, x log P, hydrogen donors, hydrogen acceptor and polar
surface area) with any of the 23 active compounds were identified.

Next, those similar compounds were prepared for docking using the
Ligand Preparation module of the Schrodinger Suite (version 2014-2),
and the best conformation of the GLP-1R identified in the previous
section was prepared in the Protein Preparation wizard with default
settings. Those compounds were then docked into the same predicted
allosteric site on the GLP-1R model. The Glide SP protocol with default
settings was used for the docking experiments.33 Each dock pose was then ranked based on its glide and docking
scores, and top ranked poses were visually inspected. After analyzing
the docking results, top-ranked compounds were identified for the
experimental evaluation.

Transfection and Cell Culture
HEK293 cells stably expressing
CRE/CREB Reporter (luciferase) were cultured in RPMI medium supplemented
with 8% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 2% (v/v) penicillin/streptomycin,
and 100 μg/mL of hygromycin B. Cells were maintained in an incubator
at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Cells (1.8 × 106 per well) were seeded into 6-well cell culture plates 1 day before
transfection. After overnight incubation, one well of cells was transiently
transfected with 3.4 μg of rat GLP1R or empty vector using lipofectamine
2000. After 4 h of transfection, transfection medium was replaced
by RPMI medium supplemented with 5% (v/v) fetal bovine serum and 2%
(v/v) penicillin/streptomycin. After 24 h of incubation, cells were
trypsinized and seeded into 96-well cell culture plates (5.5 ×
104 cells per well) and maintained at 37 °C in a 5%
CO2 incubator for 24 h. After 24 h of incubation, the transfected
cells were treated with compounds as indicated.

Luciferase
Assay
Compounds dissolved in 100% DMSO were
diluted to indicated concentration in RPMI medium (0.5% DMSO included
for all cell culture). After 4 h of treatment, cells were washed with
cold 1× phosphate-buffered saline and harvested by cold luciferase
cell culture lysis reagent. Luciferase activity was measured by a
Wallac 1420 multiplate reader. Luciferase activity of HEK293 reporting
cells cultured using 0.5% DMSO and full RPMI medium was used as a
vehicle control. The protein concentration of each well was determined
by Bradford assay.37

Nonspecific

cells stably expressing CRE/CREB Reporter (luciferase) were cultured
in RPMI medium supplemented with 8% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 2% (v/v)
penicillin/streptomycin, and 100 μg/mL of hygromycin B. Cells
were maintained at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Cells (1.8 ×
106 per well) were seeded into 6-well cell culture plates
1 day before transfection. After overnight incubation, cells were
transiently transfected with 3.4 μg of VIPR1 or N-flag tagged
pCMV3 vector using lipofectamine 2000. After 4 h of transfection,
medium was replaced by RPMI supplemented with 5% (v/v) fetal bovine
serum. After 24 h of incubation, cells were trypsinized and seeded
into 96-well cell culture plates (5.5 × 104 cells
per well) and maintained at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for 24
h. After 24 h of incubation, the transfected cells were treated with
compounds as indicated.

Glucose Stimulated Insulin Production in
INS-1 832/13 Cells
INS-1 832/13 cells were cultured in RPMI
supplemented with 2 mMl-glutamine, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 10% FBS,
10 mM HEPES, 100 units/mL penicillin, 100 μg/mL streptomycin,
and 50 μM β-mercaptoethanol. Cells were maintained
in an incubator at 37 °C with 5% CO2. To determine
the effect of GLP-1R agonist M_4 on insulin production, INS-1 cells
were seeded onto 6-well plates at the cell density of 1 × 106 per well. After 48 h of incubation, cells were washed twice
with 1 mL of KRB and starved for 2 h in fresh KRB supplemented with
0.1% serum. After 2 h of starvation, the buffer was replaced with
1 mL of KRB containing 0.1% serum, 16.7 mM glucose, and 20 μM
of M_4 or 181 nM of GLP-1 with 0.125% DMSO or 0.125% DMSO alone (vehicle
control) and incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO2. After
10 and 20 min, the supernatant was collected, centrifuged at 1000
rpm for 5 min at 4 °C, and aliquoted and stored at −20
°C. These samples were used to determine the insulin concentration
using the insulin detection kit following the manual.

Data Analysis
The concentration-dependent dose–response
curve was generated using Graph Pad Prism 6.0 for Mac (GraphPad Software
Inc., San Diego, CA). The curves were fitted based on the equation, Y = bottom + (top – bottom)/(1 + 10((log EC50 – X) × HillSlope)) or
sigmoidal dose response (variable slope). The EC50 value
was calculated from Prism.

Multiple Sequence Alignment
The
sequence of the human
GLP-1R was taken as the query sequence for similarity search against
the SwissProt database49 using BLAST50 at www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov to identify homologous proteins of high sequence identity. Top hit
human sequences which have at least 40% sequence identity with GLP-1R,
along with human VIPR1 and VIPR2 sequences, were extracted from the
SwissProt database and multiple sequence alignment were performed
using MOE (version 2018.0101) with the structure-based alignment function.

Comparison of Experimental Structures and Structural Model of
GLP-1R
In 2017, a cryo-EM structure of the rabbit GLP-1R
in its active conformation (PDB ID: 5VAI), which has >94% sequence identity
with
human GLP-1R, and a crystal structure of human GLP-1R in its inactive
conformation (PDB ID: 5VEX) were reported.24,25 These two experimental
structures were compared with the homology model generated above and
with each other. For comparison, all three structures were imported
in MOE (version 2018.0101). Then, using the seven TM helix sequences
of the homology model only as the standard, all other residues and
molecules in the three structures were deleted. The remaining structures
were superimposed and pairwise backbone atom rmsd and binding site
all-atom rmsd were calculated. Next, attempts were made to dock compounds M_4 and M_9 into the same predicted allosteric
site on the active structure of the rabbit GLP_1R using the Glide
XP protocol with default settings.
