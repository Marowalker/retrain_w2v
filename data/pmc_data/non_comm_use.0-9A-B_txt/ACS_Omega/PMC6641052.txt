Passivated aluminum
nanoparticles are surface functionalized to
elucidate their sensitivity against an electrical discharge. Two size
fractions that differ in surface morphology are investigated. Electronic
interactions between the partly inert, partly energetic organic molecules
used for surface functionalization and the alumina surface are analyzed
in detail. The nanoparticle surfaces are modified with the well-established,
inert 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid, whereas energetic
surface modification is achieved using 1,3,5-trinitroperhydro-1,3,5-triazine
or the acidic and aromatic 2,4,6-trinitrophenol. A mechanistic model
for the chemical surface functionalization of Al nanoparticles is
hypothesized and corroborated by comprehensive optical and Fourier
transform infrared spectroscopy studies. The surface structures are
adjusted by developing a tunable stabilization procedure that prevents
sedimentation and hence increases the saturation concentration in
the liquid phase and finally affects the sensitivity character in
view of electrical discharge ignition of dry powders. Detailed material
characterization is conducted using transmission electron microscopy,
combined with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and various absorption
spectroscopy techniques (steady state in the infrared and ultraviolet/visible
regime). The adjustment of surface structures of the distinct Al nanoparticle
samples offers a valuable tool for tuning and tailoring the reactivity,
sensitivity, stability, and energetic performances of the nanoparticles,
and thereby enables the safe use of these multipurpose nanoparticles.

Introduction
Aside from their use
in diverse industrial settings and as pharmaceuticals,
food additives, cosmetics, and other various household products,1 aluminum/alumina nanoparticles are used as effective
pigments for automotive coatings (as “silver”) and as
coloring pigments that are generated by an interfering thin TiO2 shell.2 In addition, Al/Al2O3 nanoparticles are also used for increasing the
modulus of elasticity of polymers (e.g., poly(methyl methacrylate),
about 25% higher compared to the untreated polymer) or for vinyl ester
resin nanocomposites.3−5 However, the focus of the present work is set on
energetic applications for dual use in defense and civil environments,
where they are essentially employed as an effective fuel component.6 For this purpose, aluminum core nanoparticles
are often combined with oxidizing agents (e.g., WO3 or
KMnO4), for thermites, or by adding additional 1,3,5-trinitroperhydro-1,3,5-triazine
(RDX), for energetic nanocomposites,7 and
further as additional fuel for explosive mixtures such as high-brisance
explosive (HBX) formulations (e.g., “HBX3” is RDX plus
nitrocellulose, calcium chloride, and calcium silicate 31.3 ±
3%, TNT 29.0 ± 3%, aluminum 34.8 ± 3%, and wax plus lecithin
4.9 ± 1%).8 Therefore, a detailed
knowledge of diverse possible interactions between aluminum/alumina
nanoparticles and the interface active molecules/material for better
and safer processing and deeper understanding of aluminum-based nanoparticle
systems is required. Here, the surface modification of passivated
aluminum nanoparticles by surface functionalization with organic molecules
is shown. In this regard, scientific literature on the nature of chemical
interaction between compounds and Al/Al2O3 surfaces
is actually rare. The chemical interaction between Al nanopowders
and RDX at higher temperatures (>70 °C) was observed by Kwok
et al. and has been an exception up to now.9 Kwok and co-workers shed light on the consequences of a chemical
interaction between Al and RDX (namely, the generation of NO2 and N2O) but not on chemical interactions between Al
and RDX with respect to bond formation or similar aspects.

However,
chemical surface functionalization of Al-based nanoparticles
by organic molecules in the literature is mostly motivated by tuning
and tailoring Al/Al2O3 nanoparticle properties
(e.g., higher solvent miscibility and disperse stability in water
or carbon dioxide, reactivity).10−12 In general, the molecule that
is foreseen to be bound to a nanoparticle surface requires an anchor
group, which forms a covalent bond (no hydrogen bonds or van der Waals
interactions). The lack of an adequate anchor group would lead to
a physically modified particle by simple physical adsorption of molecules.
Chemical surface functionalization can be realized via an inorganic
or organic pathway and is shown for pure aluminum nanoparticles, pure
alumina nanoparticles, and passivated aluminum (core–shell)
nanoparticles. Then, coatings can be amorphous or crystalline. The
latter could be epitaxially or nonepitaxially grown.13 Kaplowitz et al. report an inorganic coating of pure aluminum
nanoparticles with iron oxide for nanoenergetic fomulations.14 Other inorganic coatings of passivated aluminum
or pure alumina nanoparticles were successfully prepared out of alkaline
earth metal oxides or silanes.15,16 In contrast to alumina-coated
Al nanoparticles, pristine alumina nanoparticles cannot operate as
fuel particles because they are already oxidized. Nevertheless, chemical
modification procedures of alumina nanoparticle surfaces can be applied
for Al/Al2O3 core/shell nanoparticles because
the organic compounds only chemically interact with the Al2O3 surface, and physicochemical properties of those particular
surfaces should be the same. Jouet et al. succeeded in coating pure
Al nanoparticles with perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids.17 On the other hand, passivated Al nanoparticles
were reported to be surface-modified with acrylic monomers.10 Kappagantula et al. showed that the surface
coverage of Al fuels with an organic acid shell can be used to control
their reactivity with regard to the flame propagation velocity.12 In conjunction with the surface functionalization
of Al2O3, different kinds of anchor groups have
been reported, most of them being organic acids and carboxylates.
In general, functional acid groups are well known to bind to many
kinds of oxides because oxides natively develop an OH-terminated surface
that is attacked by acid groups, resulting in a condensation reaction
and formation of an ether (oxygen) bridge.

Here, a higher stability
against sedimentation inside the liquid
phase for effective manufacturing and treatment of Al nanoparticles
in acetone and ethanol is achieved. Second, a safer handling of Al
nanoparticles is attained. This implies that a lower sensitivity against
ignition of Al nanoparticles, especially against ignition of dry powders
by electrostatic discharge (ESD), is realized. For this purpose, two
different Al nanoparticle fractions with mean particle sizes of 50
and 100 nm were systematically surface functionalized with inert and
also with energetic organic compounds. As an inert compound, the stabilizing
2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid (TODA) is tested and for
energetic surface modification, RDX and the acidic 2,4,6-trinitrophenol
(TNP) are chosen. In addition, a detailed spectroscopy (transmission/absorption),
microscopy (electron microscopy/high-resolution-TEM/energy-dispersive
X-ray spectroscopy (EDS)), and sensitivity-based analysis is provided.

Results
and Discussion
The sizes and morphology of the raw materials
were systematically
investigated using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). TEM images
in Figure 1 visualize
Al nanoparticles of two fractions, which exhibit a mean size of xmean = 50 nm (Al_50) (a) and a mean size of xmean = 100 nm (Al_100) (b). Both Al_50 and Al_100
samples have spherical shapes. Whereas the surfaces of the Al_50 samples
are smooth, the Al_100 fraction possesses rough and porous surfaces.
Dynamic light scattering (DLS) scans of the different Al nanoparticle
charges dispersed in the liquid phase (ethanol or acetone) are shown
in the Supporting Information (SI) (Figure S1). The particle size distributions (PSDs) were collected for both
fractions, Al_50 and Al_100. Both PSDs, in ethanol as well as in acetone,
tend to be larger than xmean, as specified
by the manufacturer. Al_100 is ∼60% larger for ethanol, ∼20%
larger for acetone, and Al_50 is ∼380% larger for both solvents.
This discrepancy might follow from agglomeration and insufficient
redispersion of the primary nanoparticles. This implies that agglomeration
takes place with increasing probability the smaller the nanoparticles
are, the larger the surface-to-volume ratio (sa/vol) is, and the more
efficient the attractive interface interactions such as van der Waals
forces will become.

Figure 1 TEM images of (a) spherical Al nanoparticles with a mean
size of
50 nm (“Al_50”) and (b) Al nanoparticles with a spherical
shape and a mean size of 100 nm (“Al_100”). The Al nanoparticles
in (a) exhibit smooth surfaces, whereas the surfaces of the Al nanoparticles
in (b) are much rougher and porous.

Higher reactivity stems from the enhanced reactivity of surface
molecules compared to molecules within the bulk.18,19 Concerning higher reactivity, Al nanoparticles are favorable when
compared to their homologue micromaterial.9,18 Surface
modification through chemical functionalization obviously squeezes
the PSD. For instance, xmean of pristine
Al nanoparticles (170 nm) dispersed in ethanol decreases through surface
functionalization to 120 nm with TODA and to 140 nm with TNP. RDX
has no major effect on the PSD (see SI, Figure 1). A perceivable
and major shift is finally evaluated as a hint for the breakage of
agglomerates and an improved stabilization of primary particles through
chemical surface functionalization.

Al nanoparticles are surrounded
by a predominantly amorphous passivation
(oxide) shell, which exists under ambient conditions. The oxidation
of the Al nanoparticles results in a several nm thick amorphous (sometimes
semicrystalline) alumina coating.14 The
elemental distribution of a precursor Al_100 nanoparticle fraction
(without surface modification) is derived from TEM/EDS measurements
and is visualized in Figure 2.

Figure 2 (a) Dark-field TEM image of an “Al_100” sample in
scanning mode: an Al-core nanoparticle (and two likely agglomerated
smaller satellites) with particle sizes between 180 and 60 nm can
be seen. (b) refers to the EDS scan for aluminum, (c) for oxygen,
and in (d) all scanning modes are combined. The blue corona illustrates
the oxide shell around the Al nanoparticles.

Figure 2 shows
a
dark-field TEM analysis in scanning mode (a), the associated EDS scans
probing “aluminum” (b, 1.5 keV) and “oxygen”
(c, 0.5 keV), as well as an overlay of (b) and (c), demonstrating
the large oxygen content inside the Al2O3 corona
of an Al_100 sample. One rather large particle (∼180 nm) center
and some agglomerated satellites are depicted. The aluminum oxide
shell appears as a blue corona with a significantly higher oxygen
content compared to the inner particle section (Figure 2d). The TEM images in combination with EDS
mapping allow the determination of the thickness of the Al2O3 shell, which is 3 nm for both fractions, Al_50 and
Al_100. Thereupon, the oxide content of the Al_50 sample is larger
than that inside the Al_100 fraction. This implies that the mass ratio m(Al):m(Al2O3) of
the Al_50 fraction amounts to 1.5:1, whereas that for Al_100 is larger
with 4.15:1.

In
the following, real chemical bonding between diverse organic molecules,
taking one energetic representative (TNP), one inert steric dispersant,
and an oxygen carrier agent (TODA), is presented because interactions
of these compounds are still underrepresented in the literature, or
are absent. Spectroscopy studies (Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy
(FTIR); ultraviolet/visible (UV/vis)) were performed to investigate
the electronic interactions between passivated Al nanoparticles and
RDX, TNP, and TODA at the interface. Figure 3 shows the fingerprint region of FTIR-attenuated
total reflectance (ATR) transmission spectra containing both Al_50
and Al_100 fractions in the form of dry powders. In the case of Al_50_RDX
and Al_100_RDX, a loss of the majority of RDX through the washing
procedure can be derived from very weak RDX vibrational modes within
the FTIR transmission spectra (thus, it is not shown here, see the SI). This leads to the conclusion that RDX does
not form covalent bonds with the Al2O3 surface.
We assume that RDX does only weakly interact with the Al2O3 surface and is attached at the surface via physisorption.

and modified Al nanoparticles of the TNP (a) and TODA (b) charges.
On the right, assignment of the vibrational bands of the FTIR transmission
spectra of TNP- and TODA-modified Al_50 and Al_100 nanoparticles.

The FTIR spectra of the TODA and
TNP surface-modified Al nanoparticles
exhibit significantly different vibrational signatures that were successfully
assigned to the respective group frequencies. A clear shift of single
stretching vibration modes could be detected for the TNP-functionalized
(table in Figure 3a)
and the TODA-functionalized samples (table in Figure 3b).

TNP vibration bands of functionalized
surfaces are retained after
three washing steps and are blue-shifted—except for the O–H
stretching vibration peak, which is quenched because of surface binding.
The spectrum of the free TNP C=C-stretching vibration exhibits
a band at 1629.7 cm–1, whereas the surface-bound
one is altered to 1634.53 cm–1. This difference
in the wavenumber of the vibrational bands stems from the obviously
higher aromatic character of the benzene ring when surface bound via
the deprotonated OH group (the electronic density, also from Al2O3, is withdrawn into the electron-poor aromatic
system via the NO2 groups, which offer a negative inductive
and mesomeric effect). In fact, the intensity of the C=C vibrational
peak decreases with the simultaneously rising intensity of the aromatic
peak at Al_50_TNP (1616.21 cm–1) as well as at Al_100_TNP
(1614.28 cm–1).

For Al_50_TODA, just small
redshifts of all vibrational modes besides
a blueshift of C–H deformation vibrations (1454.20 and 1355.84
cm–1) are detected. All vibrational modes of surface-bound
TODA (Al_100) are red-shifted. This indicates the decrease in the
bond strength of all intramolecular bonds of TODA due to the electronic
interaction with the Al2O3 surface. The diverse
shifts of the vibrational C–H bands in the spectra of Al_50
(blue) and Al_100 (red) presumably arise from the differences in the
roughness, curvature, and degree of porosity of the diverse fractions,
which is not completely understood.

Concerning the binding of
TODA, we assume that it anchors via its
carboxyl group to the Al2O3 surface. This is
unambiguously shown by a shift of the C=O vibrational band
from 1739.64 cm–1 (free molecule) to 1733.85 and
1724.20 cm–1 in the case of the surface-bound molecules
at Al_50 and Al_100, respectively. The optical properties of RDX-,
TNT-, and TODA-treated Al_50 and Al_100 nanoparticles were studied
employing UV/vis absorption spectroscopy (Figure 4).

Figure 4 UV/vis absorption spectra of RDX, TNP, and TODA,
and pristine and
RDX-, TNP-, and TODA-terminated Al_50 (top) and Al_100 nanoparticles
(bottom).

The predominant characteristics
of all UV/vis spectra arise from
light scattering through the dispersed solid phase inside the liquid
phase in the Al nanoparticle suspensions. The UV/vis absorption spectrum
of aliphatic RDX shows a strong absorption onset at 242 nm (5.12 eV),
which is assigned to the electronic n → π* transition.
In contrast, absorption due to this electronic transition is drastically
reduced for RDX molecules, physisorbed at the Al2O3 surface. This indicates that only a small concentration of
RDX molecules are really attached to the surface of Al nanoparticles.

Owing to the aromatic character of TNP, the UV/vis absorption spectrum
offers two bands at 209 nm (5.93 eV) and 357 nm (3.45 eV). Moreover,
these absorption bands include shoulders at 236 nm (5.28 eV) and 416
nm (2.98 eV). For a detailed energy diagram of TNP and its electronic
transitions please see Figure S3. The first
peak and the first shoulder at 209 nm and 236 nm, respectively, are
assigned to π2 → π1* and
π1 → π2* transitions. The
second band at 357 nm and its corresponding shoulder (416 nm) are
related to the n → π1* and n → π2* transitions. In contrast, the UV/vis spectra of TNP-functionalized
Al_50 and Al_100 give two absorption bands at 236 nm (5.28 eV) and
288 nm (4.31 eV). The absorbance values of the bands of Al_100_TNP
are less intensive compared to those of Al_50_TNP because pristine
Al_100 UV/vis absorption spectrum offers an absorption minimum in
the relevant range. The absorption bands within the spectra of the
TNP-treated Al nanoparticles correspond to the blue-shifted n →
π1* and n → π2* transitions
of TNP: The chemical bond between TNP and the Al2O3 surface increases the electron density in the aromatic system
of TNP caused by the electron-withdrawing effect of the NO2 groups (see also FTIR results). This leads to an increase in the
intramolecular bond strength of TNP. This increase is recognizable
by a higher energy level of π* orbitals and therefore by blueshifts
within the absorption spectra.

The UV/vis absorption spectrum
of TODA exhibits bands at 214 nm
(5.79 eV) and 266 nm (4.66 eV) according to the π → π*
and n → π* transitions. Also, the spectrum of Al_100_TODA
gives two absorption bands at 243 nm (5.10 eV) and 289 nm (4.29 eV).
In contrast to pristine TODA, these bands are red-shifted. These redshifts
occur due to a decrease in the intramolecular bond strength in TODA,
which is a result of the bond formation between TODA and the amorphous
Al2O3 surface. However, only one absorption
band is ascertainable within the UV/vis absorption spectrum of Al_50_TODA
because the second one is superimposed by light scattering. Electronic
transitions and their exact values are presented in detail within
energetic charts in Scheme 1.

Finally, one can conclude that
results from UV/vis spectroscopy
fit well with the results obtained from FTIR. That means, real chemical
and covalent bonding, and, moreover, a specific electronic interaction
between TNP, TODA, and the Al2O3 surface is
substantive, whereas RDX does not manifest chemical affinity to the
Al2O3 particle surface. Supported by presented
spectroscopy results, applied compounds are finally found to act with
the Al2O3 nanoparticulate surface via the proposed
reaction mechanisms sketched in Scheme 2. TNP and TODA are identified to form covalent bonds
to the Al2O3 surface, depicted in Scheme 2b,c. For RDX, the interaction
with the Al2O3 surface takes place via physisorption.
In the case of TNP, we propose that, first, protonation of the OH-terminated
surface occurs due to the highly acidic character of TNP (pKa(TNP) = 0.29 (24));20 second, the condensation and electronic attack of the nucleophile
is executed, and finally, bonds are formed. Surface binding of TODA
(c) follows the same mechanism as (b) and occurs via the carboxyl
group (pKa(TODA = 4)).21 A possible collapse of the TODA (black arrow in (c)) conformation
may result from O–H interactions.

RDX, (b) TNP, and (c) TODA at the amorphous Al2O3-surface (marked in gray), as being OH-terminated (see FTIR); the
dotted lines in (a) represent H bonds, (b) suggests a possible mechanism
for the chemical bonding of TNP to the surface; clockwise: (i) deprotonation
of TNP, (ii) protonation of −OH and condensation, (iii) attack
of the nucleophile, and finally (iv) bond formation. (c) offers the
result of a comparable mechanism; however, oxo groups from TODA can
likely interact with −H at the surface to support H-bonding
and a flat orientation of the TODA molecule on top of the Al/Al2O3 nanoparticle (black arrow).

Furthermore, the prerequisite condition for good processability
of suspensions is a sufficiently high stability against sedimentation
(stabilization) and high solid percentage within the liquid phase.
Therefore, we examined the dispersibility of pristine and surface-modified
Al/Al2O3 nanoparticles in acetone and determined
the respective saturation concentrations, which are listed in Table 1. Stabilization
against sedimentation is apparent with an increase in the saturation
concentration after a time interval of 3 days. In this context, an
increased saturation concentration through surface functionalization
also mirrors an efficient interaction of the used surface-active compounds
with the used particle fractions. As expected, suitably surface-modified
Al nanoparticles demonstrate a higher dispersion stability (higher
amount of saturation concentration). Differences between pristine
Al_50 and Al_100 are likely based on the mean overall density, which
is, according to the individual core–shell volume ratio of
Al_50 and Al_100 (Al/Al2O3 = 2:1 for Al_50 and
6:1 for Al_100), 3.11 g cm–3 for Al_50 and 2.88
g cm–3 for Al_100. As the higher density of solids
when dispersed in a liquid phase leads to faster sedimentation, the
increased saturation concentration of Al_100 versus Al_50 is coherent.
From a spectroscopy point of view (FTIR), there is no hint for differing
chemical surface terminations with regard to Al_50 and Al_100. Minor
enhancement of the saturation concentration of functionalized particles
could be obtained with RDX. In both cases, the concentration of the
solid phase could be enhanced, 10% for Al_100_RDX and 16% for the
Al_50_RDX. This result is explained by minor physical interaction
between the two compounds, as can be derived from spectroscopy. Chemical
surface functionalization of Al_100 and Al_50 nanoparticles with TNP
facilitates stable dispersions, with nanoparticle concentrations increased
by 127 and 28%, respectively. The highest concentration increase in
Al nanoparticle dispersions with 104% (Al_50) and 133% (Al_100) was
achieved with TODA. This
again mirrors the efficient surface functionalization ranked as follows:
RDX exhibits rather poor surface modification and therefore poor stabilization
potential for Al2O3; TNP exhibits much better
characteristics; and TODA reveals the highest saturation concentrations
and stabilization characteristics in the case of acetone (see Table 1). The latter is obviously
less linked to good affinity of the molecules to the surface of the
particles because TNP binds more effectively through a strengthening
of the aromatic character (see the spectroscopy part), but rather
linked to an obviously better attractive interaction of the TODA-modified
surface to acetone and ethanol.

Figure 5 displays
ESD energies by spark ignition of RDX-, TNP-, and TODA-functionalized
and pristine Al nanoparticles. A star represents at least one reaction
out of six tests, a square represents no reaction within six tests.
Congruency of two symbols is not possible but rather a narrow pair
of values. For example, number 5 is Al_100 pure and offers 2.09 mJ
(reacting) and 1.85 mJ (not reacting), see Table 2. The interval between “reaction”
and “6× no reaction” increases with higher millijoules
because external capacitors are used, each with a fixed farad (F)
value (please see the Experimental section). Surprisingly, at first sight, energetic surface modification does
not automatically lead to higher sensitivity and thus higher reactivity.
Furthermore, differences between Al_50 and Al_100 with identical surface
molecule modification could be derived. In this context, Table 2 represents all sensitivity
values, also including mechanical sensitivity against impact and friction
of the tested material in the form of dry and loose powders. In a
nutshell, smaller Al particles (Al_50) show increased sensitivity
(0.31 mJ, reacting) compared to the larger fraction (Al_100, 2.09
mJ, reacting). This tendency is in line with literature results9,18 and understandable because smaller particles show higher sa/vol
and surface molecules reveal enhanced reactivity (see the first section
on PSD results from DLS). Then, the surface-modified Al_50 and Al_100
nanoparticles tend to require higher spark energies for ignition.
In opposition to pristine particles, Al_50_TODA is less sensitive
(56.56 mJ, reacting) compared to the larger particle fraction surface
modified with the same molecule (Al_100_TODA, 13.7 mJ, reacting).
This fact is proposed to be a result of the absolute amount of surface
molecules (Al_50 offers a higher sa/vol and more TODA was applied,
see the Experimental part) and varying surface
morphology: Al_50 constitutes a smooth surface where TODA molecules
can easily attach for binding, whereas Al_100 bares a much more rough
and porous surface (see Figure 1) where TODA molecules could be hindered. According to the
latter, also TODA, which is already bound to the surface, could sterically
hinder additional molecules when it is not upright bound due to surface
inhomogeneity. Because RDX is not binding in an appropriate manner,
as derived from spectroscopy studies, both ESD sensitivity values
of RDX-modified particle fractions are near those of the pristine
samples (see Table 2).

also including blank surfaces (pristine particles). Exact values can
be taken from Table 2.

In the case of TNP-surface functionalization,
Al_50 reacts at 0.31
mJ and Al_100 at 24.12 mJ. Here, it is suggested that TNP is better
bound to Al_100 because the molecule is smaller and more compact than
TODA. Consequently, surface roughness does not constitute a major
hindrance, and a better desensitization could be detected compared
to TODA (in line with a strengthening of the aromatic character, see
the spectroscopy part) because pristine Al_50 and TNP-modified Al_50
both show ESD values of 0.31 mJ; a final evaluation is not possible,
as 0.31 mJ states a limit of the device (see the Experimental section).

It is further proposed that the
decrease in reactivity and increase
in stability by chemical surface functionalization stem from the saturation
of high reactivity sites by chemical functions at the Al2O3 particle surface. In fact, the binding of active surface
molecules via condensation, as described here, reduces the overall
energy by releasing the stable leaving group water (see Scheme 2). Moreover, highly reactive
sites can also be generated by defects in general, and, for instance,
dangling bonds in particular, which are effectively saturated by surface-active
molecules to reduce the overall surface energy, and therefore to reduce
sensitivity to ignition. In this respect, the importance of ESD measurements
in general is to make sure that the sensitivity of the material to
a static discharge is below the static potential that can be developed
by the human body (5–20 mJ).6 Hence,
process safety, for example, during physical mixing of Al nanoparticles,
even when they are passivated, is of uttermost interest. The following
materials were tested to be under 20 mJ and are therefore dangerous
to handle (safety hazard) in an insecure environment: “Al_100
pure”, “Al_100_RDX”, “Al_100_TODA”,
“Al_50_pure”, “Al_50_TNP”, and “Al_50_RDX”.

Regarding impact and friction, all of the tested materials are
completely insensitive, >50 J and >360 N, respectively. All
values
for friction and impact are out of the tested range, which is defined
through the individual testing mechanism and testing device (see the Experimental part).

Synthesis
RDX
is a well-known, highly explosive substance. For surface modification
with RDX, “Hexogene M5” from Eurenco (former SNPE laboratories,
Société Nationale des Poudres et des Explosifs, Paris,
France) was purchased and used as received without further purification.
TNP (moistened with ≥40% water, ≥98%) was purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich and dried for 12 h/60 °C. TODA (techn. gr.)
was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Chemical formula can be derived
from Scheme 2. Acetone
(HPLC grade) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Ethanol (abs.) was
purchased from Carl Roth GmbH & Co. KG.

Aluminum nanoparticles
(Al_50) with an average diameter of 50 nm were purchased from Nanotechnologies,
Inc. Aluminum nanoparticles (Al_100) with an average diameter of 100
nm were purchased from Intrinsiq Materials, Inc. In a first step,
suspensions of Al_50 and Al_100 in acetone (w = 0.10
wt %, cm = 0.79 g/L) were produced by
adding Al_50 or Al_100 (150 mg) to acetone (190 mL) and by a subsequent
5 min treatment of sonication inside an ultrasonic bath.

For
surface modification of Al_50 or Al_100, 1 mL of solutions
of RDX, TNP, and TODA in acetone were added to the previously produced
aluminum suspensions. The concentrations of the used compounds are
listed in Table 3.
A monolayer of molecules was calculated for each particle size and
“precursor” in wt %. This value was multiplied by 2
to ensure that at least a monolayer in the case of efficient surface
functionalization is formed. The mixtures were treated thrice by ultrasonication
for 20 min with an interruption of 5 min between each period. Then,
the nanoparticles were collected by centrifugation (5000 rpm, 20 min)
and washed thrice with acetone (190 mL) through centrifugation and
redispersion cycles. The resulting suspension was allowed to age for
3 days. Afterward, 50 mL of the supernatant was extracted. Acetone
was removed via rotation evaporation and the Al nanoparticles were
weighed to calculate the saturation concentration of the suspensions.
Then, acetone of the remaining suspensions was removed by rotation
evaporation and the particles were collected. As references, Al_50
and Al_100 were also treated by this procedure without adding any
molecular surface function. “Al_X_Y” is decrypted as
“aluminum_size_surface motif”.

Analysis
Methods
TEM images were recorded on a JEOL,
ARM200CF (Tokyo, Japan), with a nominal point resolution of 0.8 Å
at Scherzer defocus. A cold FEG Gun 80–200 kV provided the
electron source. Semiquantitative elemental analysis and chemical
mapping were performed using an energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy
(EDS) system.

The UV–vis–NIR-absorption spectra
of the samples were recorded on a Cary 5000 spectrophotometer system
from Agilent Technologies (Santa Clara). A macroquartz glass cell
from Hellma Analytics (Müllheim, Germany) with an optical light
path of 10 mm was taken for both measurement techniques (DLS (see
the SI), UV/vis). FTIR spectra were recorded
using the tensor 27 from Bruker Optik GmbH (Ettlingen, Germany) equipped
with a standard ATR-unit MIRacle from Pike (Madison). The ATR signal
was converted by the Bruker Opus 6.5 software into transmission data.

A full-fledged sensitivity investigation, strictly according to
the Federal Institute for Materials Research and Testing guidelines
(www.bam.de; BAM; Berlin; Germany),
was additionally executed using classical test devices for impact
(fall/drop hammer, BAM), friction (Julius Peters K.G. Berlin, Germany),
and ESD (OZM Research, ESD 2008, Hrochův Týnec, Czech
Republic). In this context, loose and dry powders were investigated.
The resulting values are listed when at least one of the six tested
samples reacts (statistical relevance: 98.4%), following the recommendation
of ref (22). “>”
indicates a limit of the test device. For ESD, external ceramic capacitors
were used. Each corresponds to an exact value in Faraday. Therefore,
ESD tests cannot be continuously performed. Intervals between two
ESD values get larger when measuring higher ESD values (quadratic
function). The apparatus is described in detail elsewhere.23 For safety reasons, an additional ESD value
is given when six tested samples of one specific material does not
react. Please note that ESD values less than 0.31 mJ (capacitor 45
pF, 6 kV) cannot be adequately detected because no defined sparks
are generated at this limit.

Conclusions
Two
aluminum nanoparticle fractions that differ in mean single
particle size (50 and 100 nm) and surface roughness were surface-modified
by diverse organic motifs. In this context, inert and energetic organic
molecules were chosen for surface functionalization: energetic RDX,
TNP, and inert TODA partly interact with the Al surface. Whereas TODA
and TNP were proven to covalently bind to the Al2O3 surface via their carboxyl group (TODA) and acidic hydroxyl
group (TNP), respectively, RDX only interacts physically with the
Al2O3 surface. These findings were elaborated
and unambiguously corroborated upon performing FTIR transmission and
UV/vis absorption spectroscopy experiments. Additionally, this work
provides a reasonable reaction mechanism for Al2O3 surface modification with applied compounds. The successful surface
functionalization with TNP and TODA is evident from the enhanced stability
of the respective dispersions against sedimentation in ethanol and
acetone. The most interesting and safety-relevant result is the observation
of decreased sensitivity against ignition through energy by an electric
discharge (spark). The TODA modification lowers Al-powder sensitization
at least 40 times, which is, in fact, also a major improvement for
safety reasons regarding unwanted ignition of aluminum powders. Even
energetic compounds like TNP can provide enhanced desensitization
of pure Al core with Al2O3 shell nanoparticles.
Finally, as a result of the varying surface roughness, differences
in terms of the two Al fractions were found for the binding of identical
molecules.
