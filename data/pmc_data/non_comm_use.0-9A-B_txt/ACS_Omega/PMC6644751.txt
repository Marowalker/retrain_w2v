The
Ca2+-sensing protein S100A11 of the S100 family
is an important mediator of numerous biological functions and pathological
conditions including cancer. The receptor for advanced glycation end
products (RAGE) has been well accepted as the major receptor for several
S100 family members. Here, we take the S100B protein as an antagonist
to interfere with the interaction flanked by S100A11 and the RAGE
V domain. We employed NMR spectroscopy to describe the interactions
between the S100A11 and S100B proteins. 1H–15N heteronuclear single-quantum correlation-NMR titrations
showed the potential binding dynamics of S100A11 and S100B interactions.
In the HADDOCK program, we constructed the S100A11–S100B heterodimer
complex that was then superimposed with the S100A11–S100B complex
structure in the same orientation as the S100A11–RAGE V domain
complex. This overlay analysis showed that S100B could interfere in
the binding section of S100A11 and the RAGE V domain. Additionally,
water-soluble tetrazolium-1 assay provided a functional read-out of
the effects of these proteins in an in vitro cancer model. Our study
establishes that the development of an S100B antagonist could perform
a vital part in the treatment of S100- and RAGE-dependent human diseases.

==== Body
Introduction
The name “S100”
was given by Moore to the brain-specific
proteins later identified as a mixture of S100A1 and S100B protein.1−3 These small, acidic proteins were first referred to as S100 owing
to their ability to dissolve completely in 100% saturated ammonium
sulfate at pH 7.1 The human S100 family
is comprised of 21 similar proteins that are exclusive to vertebrates
and includes two discrete EF-hand motifs with a helix–loop–helix
structure. S100 family members range from 10 to 12 kDa, exhibit site-specific
expression patterns, and efficiently form homo and heterodimers.4−6 These proteins have known interactions with calcium, zinc, and copper
ions, and Ca2+ binding enables the numerous intracellular
and extracellular regulatory effects of these proteins.7,8 All S100 family members are considered Ca2+-sensing proteins
except for S100G, which acts as a Ca2+-modulating protein
by buffering cytosolic Ca2+.9 S100 proteins are effective regulators of a variety of diverse task
involving Ca2+ homeostasis, transcription, cell proliferation
and differentiation, tissue development, and regeneration/repair.
They are also involved in the origin and development of chronic inflammation,
autoimmunity, contagious ailments, tumors, and their metastases.10

S100 proteins have recently attracted
attention due to their involvement
in various tumorigenic processes (e.g., tumor progression, metastasis)
and altered expression patterns in multiple human cancers (e.g., pancreatic,
lung).11−23 S100A11, first identified as Calgizzarin or S100C, was initially
extracted from the smooth muscle of chicken gizzards and the cardiac
muscle of pigs.24,25 It is expressed in the kidney,
heart, lung, and most muscle tissues, with peak levels in the placenta
and lowest in the brain.26 S100A11 mediates
multiple biological processes by binding with target proteins such
as receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE), Annexin A1,
Annexin A2, p53, and Rad54B.27 However,
its oncogenic role in many cancers has drawn the maximum interest.28 It appears to be associated with tumor progression
in adenocarcinomas and is expressed excessively in various cancers
such as lung,29 colorectal,30 breast,31 pancreatic,32,33 colon,34 laryngeal,35 and papillary thyroid carcinoma.36 Additionally, S100A11 is down-regulated in the bladder37 and ovarian cancer.38

The receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) is
a 35
kDa cell surface protein which is the member of the immunoglobulin
superfamily. It is comprised of V, C1, and C2 domains reminiscent
of 3 Ig-like regions, a transmembrane helix, and a cytoplasmic end
respectively that mediates intracellular signaling.39−43 RAGE works as a pattern recognition receptor and
thereby associates with a range of signaling molecules such as advanced
glycation end products (AGEs), amphoterin, C3a, S100/calgranulin polypeptides,
phosphatidylserine, amyloid β, and advanced oxidation protein
products.44−50

RAGE binds multiple ligands and has been involved in an array
of
ailments (such as diabetic complications, cardiovascular disorders,
chronic inflammation disorders, Alzheimer disease, and neurodegeneration).51 Furthermore, RAGE activation is linked to multiple
cancers including lung,52 colorectal,53 pancreatic,54 kidney,55 prostate,56 ovarian,57 breast,58 and melanoma.59 In recent years, RAGE has emerged as a major
receptor for the S100 family proteins, and this S100–RAGE interaction
mediates cell migration, invasion, tumor growth, angiogenesis, and
metastasis but the mechanism of action remains largely unknown.60−62 Therefore, interaction studies on RAGE and its associated ligands
are desired to elucidate more insights into the development of different
diseases and design the treatment modalities thereof.

The S100B
protein is associated with a multigenic family of small
proteins that binds calcium via EF-hand motifs.63,64 It is one of the earliest associates of the S100 protein family
to be recognized and is the most active in the head region.3 S100B consists of S100 ββ homodimers.65 Many different cells including astrocytes,66 myoblasts,67 photoreceptor
cells,68 skeletal muscle tissue,69 certain neuronal populations,70 oligodendroglial progenitor cells,71 and oligodendrocytes72 express this protein
in varying amounts. Calcium-induced S100B exerts its intracellular
and extracellular functions by interacting with other proteins. Previous
studies have provided evidence of S100B’s involvement in several
regulatory pathways concerning cell proliferation, differentiation,
and morphology, calcium homeostasis, protein phosphorylation, transcription,
microtubule and type III intermediate filament dynamics, enzyme activity,
and metabolism.8,9,73,74 Interaction studies pertaining to S100B
and RAGE has been performed earlier in detail.41,75,76 Depending on the microenvironment, secreted
S100B has been shown to bind to RAGE in neurons, macrophages, myoblasts,
astrocytes, and microglia toward carrying out a diversity of biological
functions with variable effects (i.e., favorable or deleterious).77

An elevated amount of S100B has been noticed
in a range of clinical
circumstances such as brain injury and ischemia, neurodegeneration,
inflammation, and mental disorders.78 S100B
is secreted by glioblastoma cancer cells in vitro.79 Moreover, S100B is a firmly developed predictive indicator
for malignant melanoma, and increased serum levels associated with
negative patient outcomes.80,81

It was previously
reported that S100A11 interacts with the S100B
protein.82,83 In this study, we used the S100B protein
as a probable candidate for an antagonist to hinder interactions flanked
by S100A11 and the RAGE V domain, thereby inhibiting additional signal
transduction. By employing the HADDOCK (High Ambiguity Driven protein–protein
Docking) program, we constructed an S100A11–S100B heterodimer
complex by compiling the data on interacting sites between S100A11
and S100B proteins from heteronuclear single-quantum correlation-NMR
(HSQC-NMR) experiments. Then we superimposed the two complex structures
(S100A11 and S100B complexes with the S100A11 and RAGE V domain complexes),
which illustrated that S100B could interfere at the binding region
of S100A11 and the RAGE V domain. Moreover, a water-soluble tetrazolium-1
(WST-1) assay confirmed that the S100B protein can hinder cell proliferation
in vitro. This collaborative study provides structural insights into
the S100A11–S100B heterodimer complex formation, which will
facilitate the discovery of new therapies for S100- and RAGE-mediated
diseases.

Results and Discussion
Binding Interface (S100A11/S100B) Region
in S100A11
The binding regions among proteins or amongst
proteins and their
associated ligands are generally recognized by employing 1H–15N HSQC-NMR experiments.84,85 The residues near the S100A11 and S100B interfaces were recognized
by analyzing the resonances on the HSQC-NMR spectra of free S100A11
and compared to those of the S100A11–S100B complex.

Figure 1a displays the overlaid
HSQC-NMR spectra of only nitrogen-15-labeled S100A11 (red color) and
nitrogen-15-labeled S100A11 complexed with unlabeled S100B (blue color).
Some of the NMR signals decreased upon the addition of free S100B
to nitrogen-15-labeled S100A11. The observed HSQC-NMR indications
of the S100A11–S100B complex were significantly inferior to
those obtained with free S100A11. This occurrence was owing to 15N nuclei near the interaction spots of the proteins among
S100A11 and S100B.

amino-acid residues (1–105) illustrated as a bar diagram. (c)
A picture illustration of the S100A11 monomer with residues exhibiting
decreases in cross-peak signals distinguished by the cyan color.

The 15N nuclei surrounding
the interface region were
affected by the presence of other proteins in close vicinity, which
resulted in lowering the cross-peaks on the HSQC-NMR spectrum. The
S100 protein residues were influenced due to the formation of a complex
with their target proteins. The 1H–15N HSQC-NMR spectra from the free S100A11 and the S100A11–S100B
complex were matched to detect the perturbation or reduction in the
intensity of the S100A11 residues near the interface region.

A bar graph that compares the residues from both spectra is shown
in Figure 1b. Some
residues from the HSQC cross-peaks had considerably inferior intensities
(Figure 1b). These
S100A11 residues (red color) were G29, N53, G58, and S101. Residues
along with the NH2 side chains of asparagines and glutamines
(namely Q22, N31, N44, Q54, N70, Q74, N82, and Q102) were also included
(as labeled in boxes that are connected by horizontal lines in Figure 1a, however, their
specific side-chain assignments were unavailable) for plotting on
the three-dimensional (3D) construction of the S100A11 monomer (Figure 1c).

From HSQC-NMR
experiments, the spectra of the free nitrogen-15-labeled S100B area
were overlaid on the spectra of the nitrogen-15-labeled S100B in the
complex with unlabeled S100A11 (Figure 2a).

exhibiting a decrease in cross-peak signals are shown in yellow.

Cross-peaks with reduced intensities
(line broadening) were identified
and marked including S1, S18, H42, I47, and K48. The S1, S18, H42,
I47, and K48 residues (red color) were mapped onto the 3D construction
of the S100B monomer protein (Figure 2b).

Fundamental Depiction of the S100A11–S100B
Complex
To compute the protein–protein interactions,
the basic model
of the S100A11–S100B complex was built via the HADDOCK program.
The difference in the intensities and the HSQC-NMR spectra information
analysis from S100A11 and S100B provided the data for Ambiguous Interaction
Constraints (AIRs). As input parameters in HADDOCK, the residues with
a difference in the intensities (HSQC-NMR) indicated the constraints
for computation. The HADDOCK outcomes produced models for the heterodimeric
S100A11–S100B complex. The structure of Ca2+-bound
S100A11 was attained from PDB ID: 2LUC and the model of S100B were assimilated
from PDB ID: 1UWO. Almost 2000 complex models were created in HADDOCK by rigid-body
minimization. The final 200 models using the lowermost energy outcomes
following water refinement were engaged for additional examination.
The S100A11–S100B complex model is depicted in Figure 3.

Figure 3 Cartoon representing
S100A11–S100B complex created with
the HADDOCK program. S100A11 is depicted in red and S100B in blue
color. Residues near the interaction sites are illustrated in cyan
(from the S100A11 side) and yellow (from S100B side) respectively.

In total, two binding sites were
identified involving residues
S101 and Q102 from S100A11 with S1 from S100B at the first binding
site; and N53 and Q54 from S100A11 with H42 from S100B at the second
binding site. The structural stereochemistry of the complex was checked
through PROCHECK analysis provided online by the European Bioinformatics
Institute.86 The Ramachandran plot revealed
the presence of 82.1% residues in the maximum favored areas, 13.4%
in furthermore permitted areas, 2.8% in allowed regions, and only
1.7% in disallowed regions. The all-inclusive average score of G-factors
was found to be 0.19, which is in the expected range (data not included).

Dissociation Constant
In solution, S100A11 and S100B
proteins usually occur in homodimeric forms. We first got the HSQC
spectrum of 15N S100A11 (Figure 4) in the homodimer form alone.

Figure 4 1H–15N HSQC spectra of free 15N S100A11
(red).

We overlapped the HSQC spectrum
of the S100A11 homodimer alone
(as shown in red color, Figure 5) with the HSQC spectrum of the S100A11 homodimer (15N-labeled) mixed with the S100B homodimer (unlabeled) in a 1:1 ratio
(as illustrated in blue color, Figure 5). We found that the two HSQC spectra were exactly
the same. This showed that the homodimer of S100A11 does not interact
with the homodimer of S100B.

Figure 5 1H–15N HSQC spectra
overlay of free 15N S100A11 (red) and 15N S100A11
homodimer + S100B
homodimer mixture (blue).

Similar results were observed when interaction studies were
performed
through the isothermal titration calorimetry experiment where titrations
were performed by injecting 10 μL aliquots of the S100B homodimer
(1 mM, 28 injections) into 0.1 mM of the S100A11 homodimer in the
cell (and vice-versa). No binding was observed (data not included).
The supposed results were due to the fact that the homodimer of S100A11
did not interact with the homodimer of S100B. However, the monomer
of S100A11 will interact with the monomer of S100B to form an S100A11–S100B
heterodimer. This conclusion was supported by the following HSQC experiments:

S100A11 (15N-labeled) and S100B (unlabeled) proteins
were initially in their homodimeric forms. First, both the proteins
were added together (1:1 ratio) followed by denaturation (using 8
M urea to ensure that the monomer was formed for both S100A11 and
S100B proteins) and renaturation (removal of 8 M urea by exchanging
it with excess deionized water) promoting heterodimer formation. The
HSQC spectrum was acquired for this heterodimer. Then this spectrum
was overlapped with the HSQC spectrum of the free S100A11 homodimer.
The resulting NMR spectra showed a decrease in peak intensities which
may be due to the formation of heterodimers (Figure 6). This confirmed the possibility of S100A11–S100B
heterodimer formation. So, to get the idea about the dissociation
constant, we used the data from the chemical shift perturbations to
calculate Kd.

Figure 6 1H–15N HSQC spectra overlay of free 15N S100A11 (red)
and 15N S100A11–S100B heterodimers
(green).

On the basis of the alterations
from the chemical shift perturbation,
HSQC-NMR titration spectrum analysis can be employed to compute the
dissociation constant (Kd).85 The HSQC-NMR spectra of nitrogen-15-labeled
S100A11 titrated with unlabeled S100B (and vice-versa) designated
the cross-peaks that altered considerably. Residues G29, G58, and
Q102 were selected when 15N S100A11 was titrated with unlabeled
S100B and residues S1, S18, and I47 were selected with inverse titration
for our best model with the succeeding equation  In the above equation,
Δδobs represents the variation detected in
the shift among the
free and bound-form (1:1 molar ratio). Δδmax represents the maximal shift change at the 1:3 molar ratio, and
[P]t and [L]t are the net concentrations of
the protein (S100A11) and the ligand (S100B). These equations compute Kd values from the shifts found at diverse concentrations
of proteins. At a molar ratio of 1:3 of 15N S100A11 to
unlabeled S100B, the mean Kd was ∼2.8
μM. Similarly, inverse calculations (i.e., 15N S100B
to unlabeled S100A11) resulted in a mean Kd value of about ∼2.5 μM. Taken together, the average
dissociation constant was around ∼2.65 μM (Figure 7). These results indicated
that the dissociation constant (Kd) of
S100A11 was in the micromolar range.

Figure 7 Dissociation constant. Kd calculated
by the designated residues detected in 15N S100A11 HSQC
titrations with S100B (yellow) and vice-versa (brown). The overall
average Kd is about 2.65 μM.

WST-1 Assay
A
WST-1-based cell proliferation assay
was employed to describe the downstream stimulation of roles transmitted
by the RAGE V domain through S100A11. We chose SW-480 cells for our
functional assays since they have epithelial-like morphology and are
often used to study cancer in vitro. SW-480 cell is a cell line with
high expression of RAGE and low expression of the S100A11 protein.
Therefore, the role of endogenous S100A11 is not influential and changes
in the cell activity can be viewed clearly. The SW-480 cells were
treated for 48 h with S100A11 and S100B prior to analysis for viability
using the WST-1 assay.

Serum-starved SW-480 cells were matured
with S100A11 (100 nM). A 1.728-fold increase was witnessed in the
living cell count over the serum-free control (Figure 8, lane 2). This result can be elucidated
by the point that S100A11 binds to the RAGE V domain and, thus, induced
cell proliferation.87 Similarly, S100B
showed a 1.732-fold increase compared to the serum-free control (Figure 8, lane 3) indicating
that S100B does bind to RAGE and the interaction of S100B (similar
to S100A11) with endogenous RAGE contributes to cell proliferation.
However, a 1.44-fold decrease was observed in cells treated with the
S100A11–S100B (100 nM) heterodimer protein (Figure 8, lane 4). These results suggest
that the S100B protein potentially interferes with the contact between
S100A11 and the RAGE V domain, in addition to inhibiting cell proliferation
activity.

Figure 8 WST-1 assay analysis. The SW-480 cells were treated with 100 nM
of S100A11 (dark blue), 100 nM of S100B (light blue), and 100 nM of
S100A11–S100B heterodimers (green). The proportional cell counts
after subsequent treatment with S100A11 and S100B are depicted as
fold inductions with serum-free media alone as the control (red).

S100B Inhibits the S100A11–RAGE
V Domain
S100A11
is well-known to exist in a noncovalent homodimeric form having an
antiparallel conformation. Molecular interactions between S100A11
and the RAGE V domain have shown that S100A11 binding to the RAGE
V domain could eventually trigger an autophosphorylation process leading
to numerous signal transduction cascades that regulate cell proliferation
and migration.87,88 Here, we used a similar S100A11–RAGE
V domain complex model for our studies (Figure 9a).87

to S100A11–RAGE V domain associated with the S100B protein.

Analysis of the S100A11 HSQC spectra
with and without unlabeled
S100B revealed the S100A11 residues involved in the interaction with
S100B. These participating residues near the interaction sites from
the S100A11 side were N53, Q54, S101, and Q102. Likewise, S100A11
residues involved in the interaction with the RAGE V domain were N53,
Q54, and A90 respectively (Figure 5b).87 Interaction studies
related to S100A11 and the RAGE V domain have been performed previously
in detail.87 Binding affinity values indicated
a stronger interaction between S100A11 and the RAGE V domain when
compared to the S100A11–S100B interaction. However, it may
be noted that the interaction of S100A11 either with the RAGE V domain
or S100B involved a common interaction site (s). Therefore, comparing
the S100A11–S100B complex model (obtained through the HADDOCK
program) with the S100A11–RAGE V domain complex (constructed
in the similar manner87), S100B showed
considerable interference. This indicates successful inhibition of
the formation of S100A11–RAGE V domain complex (Figure 9b).

Furthermore, through
the WST-1 assay it can be understood well
that the treatment of exogenous S100A11 and S100B, separately, to
SW-480 cells resulted in cell proliferation compared to the control
cells. This indicated the interaction of both S100A11 and S100B with
the endogenous RAGE V domain giving rise to higher cell counts. However,
treatment of the SW-480 cells with the S100A11–S100B heterodimer
protein led to a decrease in cell proliferation significantly which
indicated that S100B has obstructed the greatly desired interface
position of S100A11 and the RAGE V domain needed for higher cell count.
In conclusion, an association of S100A11 with S100B has blocked significantly
the RAGE signaling causing cell proliferation, and we hypothesize
that S100B (or similar antagonist) will disrupt the S100A11–RAGE-mediated
signaling significantly in cancerous cells when introduced in higher
concentrations.

Conclusions
The biological importance
of S100 family proteins associated with
RAGE is well-known and S100–RAGE-mediated signaling pathways
have been investigated for their role in the progress of many human
cancers.89,90 For instance, S100A11 and RAGE signaling
have been shown to modulate osteoarthritis pathogenesis.91,92 Additionally, the association of RAGE was found to enhance S100A11
secretion in human squamous cancer cells.28 S100–RAGE-mediated signaling is likely a relevant therapeutic
target for the treatment of S100–RAGE-related disorders. In
an experimental mouse model, blocking S100–RAGE interactions
resulted in the reduction of colonic inflammation and decreased infiltration
of inflammatory cells.46,93

Here, we report a study
that details the interactions between S100A11
and S100B proteins, proving the interference of S100B in the binding
of the S100A11–RAGE V domain in vitro. These data propose that
an improvement in the S100B antagonist could greatly impact S100 protein-
and RAGE-dependent human diseases. The results from the complex structure
analysis confirmed that S100B interferes at the interface region of
S100A11 and the RAGE V domain, further highlighting the therapeutic
potential of this pathway. In addition, treatment with the S100A11–S100B
heterodimer protein in vitro resulted in lower cell numbers in a cancer
model.

Overall, our analysis provides prominent structural insights
into
S100A11–S100B heterodimer complex formation and suggests that
an antagonist similar to S100B could be promising for the discovery
of new therapies pertaining to S100- and RAGE-mediated diseases.

Materials
and Methods
Materials
All the HSQC-NMR experiments were performed
utilizing 99% pure isotope-tagged 15N-ammonium chloride
(15NH4Cl) and deuterium oxide (D2O). Solutions were formulated using Milli-Q water and sample buffers
for the said experiments were purified with a 0.22 μm aseptic
device. SW-480 cancer cells were acquired from the American Type Culture
Collection (CCL-288).

Expression, Labeling, and Purification
Human S100A1188 and S100B94,95 proteins were expressed
and purified as per the protocols mentioned earlier. The purity and
identity of the acquired proteins were determined by the sodium dodecyl
sulfate (SDS)–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) gel
method and confirmed by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry
(ESI-MS) analysis (Supporting Information, Figures S1 and S2).

HSQC-NMR Titration Experiments
All
HSQC-NMR experiments
were executed inside a Varian 700 MHz spectrometer at 25 °C by
utilizing a cryogenic probe. Using an NMR buffer (100 mM NaCl, 5 mM
CaCl2, 25 mM Tris/HCl, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 10% D2O, 7.5 pH), an unlabeled S100B protein was supplemented to 15N-labeled-S100A11 at molar ratios of 0:1, 1:1, and 3:1. As these
proteins occur in homodimeric forms, they were initially denatured
in the presence of 8 M urea before associating as heterodimers.83,96,97 The 8 M urea was completely exchanged
with high amounts of water (dialysis will facilitate and ensure the
heterodimer formation) and finally replaced with NMR buffer. The converse
titration experiments (15N-labeled S100B and unlabeled
S100A11) with the similar protocol and molar ratios were carried out
as well. The resulting NMR spectra were handled with the VNMRJ 2.3
program and studied further by Sparky 3.198 toward identifying any chemical perturbations, shifts in the cross
peaks, or variations in the peak intensities of the protein.

Molecular
Docking
The S100A11–S100B complex
model was obtained by using the HADDOCK program (version 2.2).99−101 For docking studies, NMR coordinates for S100A11 and S100B were
recovered from the Protein Data Bank (PDB ID: 2LUC and PDB ID: 1UWO, respectively).88,94 The residues with detectable chemical shift perturbations or decreased
intensity based on HSQC titrations were assimilated for future interaction
studies. These residues were included in the Ambiguous Interaction
Constraints (AIR) parameters and the residues were assigned as active
and passive residues based on the NACCESS program.102 Residues with a comparative accessible surface area >30%,
plus side chains and backbone, were considered as active while those
<30% were considered as passive residues. A total of 2000 structures
were considered for rigid-body docking by using the usual HADDOCK
procedure including the optimized potential for liquid simulation
parameters.103 Five hundred structures
were then considered for semi-flexible refinement, and the next 200
lowest energy structures were examined. All possible structures in
clusters were studied and analyzed by the PyMOL program.104

Cell Proliferation Assay
The WST-1
[4-[3-(4-iodophenyl)-2-(4-nitrophenyl)-2H-5-tetrazolio]-1,3-benzene
disulfonate] cell proliferation
assay was executed as per the manufacturer’s (Roche) guidelines.
