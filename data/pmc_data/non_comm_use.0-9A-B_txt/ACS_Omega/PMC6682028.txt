Engineering
of water-dispersible Gd3+ ions-decorated reduced graphene
oxide (Gd-rGO) nanosheets (NSs) has been performed. The multifunctional
capability of the sample was studied as a novel contrast agent for
swept source optical coherence tomography and magnetic resonance imaging,
and also as an efficient drug-delivery nanovehicle. The synthesized
samples were fabricated in a chemically stable condition, and efforts
have been put toward improving its biocompatibility by functionalizing
with carbohydrates molecules. Gd incorporation in rGO matrix enhanced
the fluorouracil (5-FU) drug loading capacity by 34%. The release
of the drug was ∼92% within 72 h. Gd-rGO nanosheets showed
significant contrast in comparison to optically responsive bare GO
for swept source optical coherence tomography. The longitudinal relaxivity
rate (r1) of 16.85 mM–1 s–1 for Gd-rGO was recorded, which was 4 times
larger than that of the commercially used clinical contrast agent
Magnevist (4 mM–1 s–1) at a magnetic
field strength of 1.5 T.

1 Introduction
Advanced
nanomedicine demands designing of nanomaterials having
multimodal functionality involving imaging, detection, and therapeutics.1−3 The pursuit for enhancing nanomaterials’ performances requires
tailoring and designing of parameters such as size, morphology, active
surface chemistry, composition, etc.4 of
the material for multifunctionality.5,6 Engineering
could be of single or combination of multicomponent materials enhancing
superiority in performances.7,8 The examples include
lowering of required drug dosage,9 cutoff
in the cost for using multiple techniques, surgical risks,10 damage to normal tissues,11 enhanced blood retention time with tissue or membrane permeation,12 larger imaging contrast density,7 specific and targeted delivery of drugs,13 etc. Nanomaterials of different types, such as fluorescent
dyes,14 quantum dots,14 carbon nanotubes,15 and gold
nanoparticles,16 have been explored for
fluorescence, optical, electrical, and photothermal responses. Gadolinium
ion (Gd3+), from lanthanide family, is well known for clinical
applications due to its unique physical and chemical properties.17 Being paramagnetic in nature, it is used as
a contrast agent for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).18 Gd–chelator complexes in the form of
Gd-DTPA (Magnevist) and Gd-DOTA (Dotarem) are commercially available
as T1 contrast agent. On the contrary,
Gd–chelator complexes face severe drawbacks due to leaching
of Gd3+ ions from complexes, which get accumulated in the
body and cannot be metabolized, leading to various detrimental effects
to human.19 The toxicity induced by Gd3+ ions can cause nephrogenic system fibrosis in patients with
renal dysfunction and also inhibit calcium channels.20 In some of the recent reports, engineered Gd3+ ions with nanocarriers have been proved to be effective in rescinding
leaching while enhancing T1-shortening
capacity.21 However, much work is still
in need for obtaining multiple objectives as single modality cannot
fulfill all of the requirements of theranostics. Several works have
been already carried out using nanographene oxides, graphene quantum
dots, and reduced graphene oxide with combined effect of fluorescence
bioimaging, photodynamic therapy, photothermal therapy, and cancer
therapy.22−24

Therefore, engineering of Gd3+ ions
decorated on two-dimensional
structures, which could give large optically responsive surface area
well distributed with magnetically responsive nanoparticles, could
be of interest. The present manuscript reports the engineering of
Gd3+ ions decorated on planar graphene oxide matrix chelated
by diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA). The designed material
has been tested as a multimodal bioimaging contrast agent for optical
coherence tomography (OCT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) along
with drug-delivery efficiency.

2 Materials and Method
2.1 Materials
Fine graphite powder (CDH),
concentrated sulfuric acid (E Merck), sodium chloride (E Merck), potassium
permanganate (E Merck), ∼30% hydrogen peroxide (E Merck), concentrated
hydrochloric acid (37%) (Merck), and distilled water (Millipore),
ammonia solution (∼25%, S. D. Fine Chemicals Ltd.), gadolinium(III)
nitrate hexahydrate (≥99.9%), d-gluconic acid (49–53
wt % in H2O), ethyl(dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide (EDC)
(>97%), N-hydroxylsuccinimide (NHS) (98%), diethylenetriaminepentaacetic
acid (DTPA), and dialysis membrane (Sigma) were used. 2-(N-Morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid (MES) was purchased from Molychem.
Dimethylformamide (DMF) was purchased from Rankem Ltd.

2.2 Preparation and Characterization of Gd3+-Decorated
Reduced Graphene Oxide Matrix
GO was
prepared from pure and ultrafine graphite powder employing modified
Hummers’ method. Graphite powder (2.5 g) and sodium chloride
(50 g) were thoroughly mixed, followed by slow addition of precooled
sulfuric acid (50 mL) after placing the resultant mixture in an ice
bath.

KMnO4 (8 g) was added gradually in portions
to the prepared mixture with constant stirring, and the temperature
of the reaction mixture was controlled around ca. 10–15 °C.
Subsequently, distilled water (250 mL) was slowly mixed to further
dilute the system. 30% Hydrogen peroxide solution (30 mL) was successively
employed to reduce the excess unreacted KMnO4. The resulting
brown suspension was centrifuged, repeatedly washed with dilute HCl
(1:1 v/v) followed by distilled water, and then dried in a hot oven
at ∼90 °C to obtain a dark brown mass. Preparation of
the reduced graphene oxide (rGO) nanosheets (NSs) involved the modifications
of base GO, which itself was fabricated using Hummers’ method.
GO nanosheets are generally synthesized using combined exfoliation
and hydrothermal autoclave method. However, the synthesis process
of graphene oxide nanosheets often lacks in even surfaces and edges
due to the high-temperature fabrication technique. In the present
work, a low-temperature approach with multiple steps has been utilized
for the fabrication of graphene structure. This approach also provides
hydrophilicity and biocompatibility allowing for better dispersibility,
stability in water, and is nontoxic toward biological systems. The
surface of GO was modified to rGO-NH2 (Figure 1C) by using ammonia solution
to introduce amine functionality. NH3 solution (10 mL)
was added to an aqueous dispersant of GO (70 mg) under vigorous stirring
for 2 h. The resultant mixture was later heated at 120 °C with
continuous stirring for 12 h to ensure complete conversion of carboxyl
functionalities (−COOH) to amide (−CONH2)
under nitrogen atmosphere (inert condition).

Figure 1 Schematic illustration
of synthesis of Gd-rGONSs; the procedure
involves oxidation of graphite (G) (A) to graphene oxide (GO) and
(B) via modified Hummers’ method. Graphene oxide (GO) (B) to
reduced graphene oxide (r-GO) (C) (reduced and functionalized with
amine functional groups). Dispersity of r-GO was enhanced by incorporating d-gluconic acid (GA) (D) and functionalized with pentetic acid
(DTPA) (E). Gd3+ ions decorated over reduced graphene oxide
nanosheets (Gd-rGONSs) (F) were obtained successfully as Gd3+ ions were chelated by DTPA.

The obtained mixture was purified using a dialysis membrane
(12 000
Da molecular weight cutoff (MWCO)) until the solution was neutralized.
A mixture of ethyl(dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide (EDC) (23 mg)
and N-hydroxylsuccinimide (NHS) (20 mg) was added
to d-gluconic acid (GA) (0.8 mL) in 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid (MES) (1 mL, 4 mmol) buffer and stirred
for 50 min under dark conditions to activate the carboxyl groups of
GA. The rGO-NH2 (60 mg) was later added to the activated
mixture of GA, EDC, and NHS to form the bonds between the carboxyl
groups of GA and the −NH2 functional locations of
rGO-NH2 (Figure 1D). The resultant product was purified to remove unreacted
molecules through dialysis. Diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA)
(6 mg) dissolved in DMF (1 mL) was added to EDC (52 mg) in MES (1
mL) and kept under dark conditions for 30 min to activate the DTPA
functional groups. The activated mixture was then added to rGO-GA
solution with overnight stirring (Figure 1E). The solution was purified by dialysis
against Milli-Q water (pH 7) at room temperature for 24 h. To decorate
Gd3+ ions over the surface of rGO-DTPA, a gadolinium(III)
nitrate hexahydrate solution (1.38 × 10–4 mM)
was prepared in MES buffer (1 mL) and added dropwise to a solution
of rGO-DTPA in MES buffer (1 mL) at the rate of 10 μL s–1 (Figure 1F). The solution was kept for 12 h under gentle stirring and
dialyzed against water for removal of undesired molecules. The obtained
Gd-rGONSs was dried in a vacuum oven at 60 °C for 12 h and stored
for further characterizations. The Milli-Q water (Millipore SAS 67/20
Mosheim) of 10–7 S cm–1 was used
throughout the fabrication of the nanostructures. The stepwise reaction
is well discussed in detail using UV–visible spectra (Figure S1), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR)
spectra (Figure S2), and field-emission
scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) images (Figure S3) provided in the Supporting Information.

The morphology
and size of GO (Figure 2A) and Gd-rGONSs (Figure 2B) were studied using a field emission scanning
electron microscope (QUANTA 200 FEG, FEI, the Netherlands). The morphology
of Gd-decorated reduced graphene oxide nanosheets was studied using
a JEOL JEM-2100 high-resolution transmission electron microscope (HR-TEM)
operated at 180 kV, as shown in Figure 2C,D. Figure 2A illustrates well-separated GO sheets with few layers. GO
nanosheets were clearly visible as thin curtains with relatively large
surfaces. This indicates considerable exfoliation of graphite during
the oxidation process. The multiple layers were also observed with
the Gd over the sheet surface with average size of <50 nm (Figure 2B). To verify even
distribution of Gd3+, the samples were imaged with HR-TEM
device. Figure 2C,D
shows the morphology of GO and Gd-rGONS samples. Figure 2C shows that the GO nanosheets
are rippled, which is important for functionalization and decoration
of Gd3+ ions. The Gd3+ ions decorated over rGO
surface showed narrow homogeneous distribution. It can be easily observed
that nano-Gd3+ ions are decorated across the surface (Figure 2D). The smaller size
is due to conjugation by DTPA chelating agents present over the rGO
surfaces.

Figure 2 FESEM images of GO (A) and Gd-rGONSs (B) and the corresponding
HR-TEM images of GO (C), Gd-rGONSs (D), energy-dispersive X-ray of
Gd-rGONSs, (E), and particle size distribution histogram (F).

The Gd3+ ions can be
clearly observed with sufficient
decoration over the few layers of rGO nanosheets owing to their proper
functionalization with multiple steps as mentioned above. The sufficient
functionalization was attributed to the efficient ligand coordination
extended at the interface between the rGO surface and the DTPA complexes
encapsulating the Gd3+ ions. This provided a chemically
and physically stable morphology to the multicomponent system. The
planner sheet-like regions are prospective of unaltered graphene oxide.
This is evident from the regions that are devoid of any Gd3+ ions and agglomeration of any other particles even after an extended
period of ultrasonic treatment during the preparation of TEM specimens.25 This could also be one of the reasons where
the chelating agent alone for Gd3+ complex formulation
anchors them firmly on thin rGO sheets and would prevent leaching
of Gd3+ ions. The later experiment with xylenol orange
dye and ICP-OES for detection of leached out free Gd3+ supported
our observation (Figure 4B1,B2).

The X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of GO and Gd-rGONSs
was obtained
using a PANalytical X’Pert Pro XRD operating at a Cu Kα
wavelength λ = 1.54 Å to verify the crystal structure of
the synthesized materials, as shown in Figure 3A. The scans were performed over a 2θ
range of 10–80° with a step size of 0.013°. Figure 3A compares the two
diffraction patterns of GO and Gd-rGONSs. The XRD patterns for GO
show characteristic peaks at 10.8, 26.6, and 42.5° corresponding
to the ⟨002⟩, ⟨110⟩, and ⟨100⟩
planes of graphene oxide26 and a small
peak at 26.6° corresponds to reduced graphene oxide (rGO).27 The spectra for Gd-rGONSs provide a broad peak
at ∼26° due to expected surface modification and decoration
of Gd3+ ions (JCPDS pdf #12-0797). The incorporation of
Gd3+ ions on the rGONSs reduced the intensities of the
peaks positioned at ∼43 and ∼54.7° corresponding
to the ⟨200⟩ and ⟨101⟩ planes of graphite.27 The absence of the prominent peak at ∼10.8°
and a broad peak at ∼26° for Gd-rGONSs samples confirms
the reduction of GO to rGO. In addition to the above observations,
interlayer distance values also support the reduction process of GO
to rGO. The estimated “d” values of
0.82 for GO sample decreased to 0.34 for Gd-rGONSs.26,28 The crystallite size of GO was calculated by using the Debye–Scherrer
formula mentioned in eq 1 1  The average crystallite size L was
estimated from the full width β at half-maximum of the
⟨110⟩ peak, and it was found that the crystallite size
increases (due to surface functionalization) from 5.8 nm (GO) to 7.3
nm (Gd-rGONSs).29,30 The XRD spectrum of Gd-rGONS
sample shows no characteristic peak of unreacted elemental Gd or Gd2O3. This clearly indicates that Gd is present in
the ionic form, chelated with DTPA. The absence of any oxide peak
of GO indicates complete reduction of GO to rGO in the second step
mentioned in Figure 1C.

Figure 3 Comparative X-ray diffraction spectra (A), Raman spectra (B), and
FTIR spectra (C) of graphene oxide (GO) and Gd-decorated reduced graphene
oxide nanosheets (Gd-rGONSs).

The structural changes over GO surfaces after Gd3+ ions
decoration is represented by Raman spectra in Figure 3B. In the Raman spectra of GO and Gd-rGONSs,
D peak appeared at ∼1344 and ∼1354 cm–1, while G peak appeared at ∼1596 and ∼1589 cm–1, respectively. The shift in the D and G peak positions after surface
modifications and reduction process ensures the lattice distortions.
The G vibration mode owing to the first-order scattering of E2g phonons by sp2 carbon corresponds to the Brillouin
zone of crystalline sp2 lattices in graphite.31 The D vibration bands are obtained from the
breathing mode of k-point photons of A1g symmetry and originate from the zone boundary phonons.32 The ID/IG peak intensity ratios are about 0.91 and 0.99 for GO
and Gd-rGONSs, respectively, confirming the reduction in average size
of sp2 domains and edge defects.33 The C=C bonds reduction in graphene oxide infers the introduction
of sp3 defects after functionalization with higher I(D)/I(G) ratio attributed
to larger density of structural defects.34 The minor shift of G band (∼8 cm–1) to
lower energy confirms the covalent grafting of organic molecules,
which isolates sp2 carbon atoms.35

The chemical bond formation was verified using FTIR spectroscopy
(PerkinElmer Spectrum 65 series FTIR spectrophotometer). Approximately
1.4–2.0 mg of the sample was mixed with ∼200 mg of KBr
(AR, Sigma) for making pellets (Model Mp-15) at 8–9 kg cm–2 for 1–3 min. After a background scan with
KBr pellet, the samples were analyzed using FTIR spectroscopy within
the range of 4000–400 cm–1. The FTIR spectra
for GO and Gd-rGONSs are provided in Figure 3C. The adsorbed moisture in the sample presents
peaks at ∼3117 and ∼3100 cm–1, which
are attributed to the O–H stretching vibration. The peaks at
∼1588, ∼1400, and ∼618 cm–1 are due to ionized carboxyl stretching νas(COO–) signifying the presence of oxygen-containing groups
in graphene.36 The red shift observed at
∼1577 and ∼1397 cm–1 for Gd-rGONSs
signifies interaction of rGO surface for modification, demonstrating
N–H bending and C–O stretching, respectively.37 The peaks at ∼1109 and ∼1190 cm–1 are due to C–O–C and C–O stretching
vibrations for graphene oxide, which can also be seen for Gd-rGONSs
at ∼1056 and ∼1206 cm–1 due to C–O
epoxide and C–O alkoxy stretchings, respectively.38

Elemental analysis of Gd3+ ions
in Gd-rGONSs sample
was done using an inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer
(ICP-OES; model 7300 DV, PerkinElmer). The estimated composition complies
with precursor ion molar ratio used in synthesis, which could be used
to control surface area and energy by utilizing Gd3+ ions
chelated by DTPA with seven coordination numbers (ionic radius, 0.99
Å). There is enhancement in Gd-rGONSs effective surface area
and energy. The amount of Gd3+ estimated by ICP-OES was
1.3 × 10–2 g L–1 mg–1, which gave efficiency of chelation by DTPA present over rGONSs
surface as ∼6%, estimated using eq 2 2  The UV–visible spectra obtained using
a UV-1800 Shimadzu spectrophotometer are shown in Figure 4A for GO and Gd-rGONSs. The spectra for GO depict an absorbance
peak at ∼232 nm due to π → π* transition
of aromatic C–C ring with a shoulder peak at ∼300 nm
due to n → π* transitions of C=O bond. For Gd-rGONSs,
the absorption spectrum undergoes a red shift of the absorbance peak
to ∼263.5 nm due to reduction of GO to rGO. The spectrum also
shows the absorbance at ∼305.0 nm restoring conjugated C=C
bonds even after reduction.39−41 The UV–visible results
may be considered in agreement with the XRD results showing successful
reduction of GO samples. Figure S1 could
be refereed for each steps of change in the absorbance. The multifunctional
activity of the designed materials in terms of drug delivery has been
calculated using a UV–visible spectrophotometer. The contrast
enhancements in optical coherence tomography (OCT) have been studied
using the custom-made swept source optical coherence tomography (SSOCT)
setup, and the magnetic resonance (MR) images were acquired using
an MRI human scanner.

The bioimaging efficiency of the samples was performed using
a
custom-built SSOCT. The OCT setup utilizes an AXSUN scanning laser
(1064 nm) with a scanning rate of 100 kHz. The imaging protocol was
set to capture 100 B-frames of the same 5 mm location of the sample.
Each B-frame consists of 1900 forward scanning A-scans and 100 in
fly back. Each A-scan is composed of 2048 pts. of the acquired signal
(corresponding to ∼1.8 mm in depth), which is appropriately
postprocessed to generate the structural image. The control and data
acquisition of the OCT system has been performed via LabVIEW and the
postprocessing performed via MATLAB.

T1 relaxivity
measurements of water protons in the presence
of Gd-rGONSs sample were performed by Siemens Magnetom Essenza 1.5
T MRI human scanner. An in vitro phantom image was collected for the
samples of different concentrations, and the values were fitted for
obtaining a linear plot for 1/T1 versus
Gd concentration to obtain r1 value from
its slope. R1 mapping used a spin echo
pulse sequence to obtain image with the following parameters: slice
thickness, 3 mm; matrix size, 686 × 686; number of slices, 5;
echo time (TE), 9 ms; repetition time (TR) values, 200, 400, 800,
1600, and 3200 ms. R1 was obtained using
saturation recovery eq 3(42) 3  where S0 stands
for the magnetization at equilibrium and c stands
for a compensation term of the noise in measurement of data.

Relaxivity of the samples is determined by the rate of relaxation R as a function of concentration C according
to eq 4(43) 4  

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Toxicity Studies of Gd-rGONSs
The
percentage of Gd3+ ions leaching was accessed through conventional
spectroscopic quantification method using xylenol orange in acetate
buffer. The determination of leached Gd3+ ions was performed
using 2 mL of 0.001 M xylenol orange solution in acetate buffer (pH
5.81) and 60 μL of supernatant of Gd-rGONSs (21.78 μg)
dispersed in water. The mixture was analyzed by a UV–visible
spectrometer.

The ratio of two absorbance maximum characteristic
peaks of xylenol orange solution in the 350–625 nm region provides
the amount of leached Gd3+ ions. The experiment showed
no considerable leached ions from the Gd-rGONSs samples when dispersed
in water (Figure S4). This was a direct
method of toxicity test, and the Gd-based rGO sample was found to
be nontoxic. The calculation was based on the calibration curve obtained
and the value of linear fit equation (y = mx + c), as shown in Figure 4B.44 The light
yellow color of xylenol orange in acetate buffer (pH 5.81) turns purple
in the presence of Gd3+ ions chelated by xylenol orange.
This is the visual confirmation of leaching from the samples. Further,
the cytotoxicity of GO and Gd-rGONSs was obtained by using standard
protocol of 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazoliumbromide (MTT)
assay. The H1299 cells were seeded in 96-well microplates (Corning)
at a density of 5 × 103 cells per well and kept in
a CO2 incubator at 37 °C for 24 h. After 24 h, different
concentrations of GO and Gd-rGONSs (10, 20, 40, and 80 μg mL–1) were applied to the cells and incubated for 24 h
to evaluate the cytotoxic effect. After completion of incubation period,
100 μL of MTT reagent was added to each well followed by incubation
for 3 h. After 3 h, MTT reagent was replaced by 150 μL of dimethyl
sulfoxide for the formation of formazan crystals and incubated at
room temperature for 30 min. The plates were read in a microplate
reader (BIO-RAD microplate reader-550) at 570 nm. Figure S5 shows calculated results with improved cell viability
of Gd-rGONSs compared to GO; ∼85% (from ∼65%, respectively,
due to the obvious reason of functionalization with biocompatible
ligands.

Therefore, the as-prepared samples were stable and
problems associated
with the Gd3+ ions accumulation would be minimized through
chelating the Gd3+ ions by DTPA and anchored over the rGO
surface (Figure 1).
This step of synthesis provided stability, reduced toxicity, and increased
effective surface area.

3.2 Drug Loading and Release
Behavior
The drug loading efficiency and release profile
were determined using
Fluorouracil (5-FU) as model drug. 5-FU is widely used as a fluoropyrimidine
drug and has various other applications for treatment of colon cancer,
cervical cancer, esophageal cancer, pancreatic cancer, stomach cancer,
and breast cancer. Apart from this, it is used as eye drops for treatment
of ocular surface squamous neoplasia and as ocular injection for trabeculectomy
bleb to lower intraocular pressure.10

For determination of drug loading on the surface of GO and Gd-rGONSs,
the calibration curve was validated and obtained as rectilinear in
the concentration range of 1–19 μg mL–1 (r2 = 0.9991). The drug was dissolved
in water at 4 mg mL–1 concentration (30.75 mM) and
added to ∼2 mg of GO and Gd-rGONSs, respectively. The dispersant
was kept in a shaker incubator for 12 h at a shaking speed of 200
rpm for sufficient loading. The mixture was further centrifuged and
the supernatant was taken from the mixture. The concentration of the
supernatant was estimated from UV–visible absorbance at its
characteristic peak of 266 nm. The absorbance values were used by
fitted equation of calibration for calculating the amount of drug
loading. The calculated amounts of drug loading were ∼0.19
mg mg–1 (19 ± 14.2%) and ∼0.26 mg mg–1 (26 ± 14.0%) for GO and Gd-rGONSs, respectively.
The loading efficiency was calculated by theoretical loading using eq 5 5  The data
showed a loading efficiency for GO
to be 9.2 ± 0.34%, which increased to 11 ± 2.57% for Gd-rGONSs
using eq 6 6  The Gd3+ ions incorporation within
rGO nanosheets compared to GO slightly changes the drug loading due
to the increase in effective surface area and the surface functionalization
associated with chelated Gd3+ ions with DTPA. The π–π
stacking at the interface of nanoscale reduced graphene oxide and
the anticancer drug decides loading and release of the drug. The 5-FU
anticancer drug being an aromatic, “benzenoid” resonance
contributor and “diamide” contributor that obeys all
preference rules and has a loop of conjugated π bonds with two
sp2 nitrogen45 helps in loading
over nanoscale graphene oxide derivatives. In addition to this, 5-FU
is relatively hydrophilic drug and therefore π–π
interactions with GO surface would be less in comparison to specially
engineered Gd-rGONSs leading toward lower drug loading capacity without
surface modification of GO. Therefore, functionalization of GO surface
could enhance drug loading by increasing π–π staking
and plausibly hydrogen bonds between the 5-FU and Gd-rGONSs surface.

The loading on both sides of functionalized rGO surfaces and immobilization
of drug and voids over rGO surface further enhance drug loading content.
The drug release profile for 5-FU-loaded GO and Gd-rGONSs is illustrated
in Figure 4C. The drugs-loaded
GO and Gd-rGONSs were redispersed in 1 mL of water and filled in membrane
dialysis tubing bag (12 000 Dalton molecular weight cutoff
(MWCO)). Each dialysis tube was placed individually into 12 mL of
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4) release media and kept for
stirring at 100 rpm with a temperature of 37 °C. The concentration
of the drug released was measured at different time intervals by withdrawing
an aliquot of 2 mL from release medium and replacing with same volume
of fresh medium. The withdrawn aliquot was measured by UV–visible
spectroscopy for the amount of drug released. The initial release
was burst release probably due to drug molecules close to both sides
of nanosheets surface getting rapidly released out into the buffer
solution. The % cumulative release achieved was around 92% in 72 h
with both the nanocarriers of GO and Gd-rGONSs. Interestingly, although
drug loading efficiency got enhanced due to Gd incorporation in rGO
matrix, no significant change in release profile was observed. This
might be attributed to no further change in the nature of drug loaded
over nanosheets. A comparative report mentioning the loading and release
of 5-FU drug using graphene-based nanocarriers is presented in Table S1. The sample used for drug loading and
release in the present work showed higher efficiency having comparatively
higher values than the reported ones (Table S1). Moreover, the reported samples involved complicated functionalization
to enhanced drug delivery efficiency (Figure 1D–F). Therefore, usage of Gd-rGONSs
might act as potential drug carrier of 5-FU.

3.3 Swept
Source Optical Coherence Tomography
for in Vitro Tissue Imaging
The usability of GO and Gd-rGONSs
as a potential contrast agent for imaging of biological tissue has
been studied using OCT. Different imaging techniques have been explored
to study various diseases, including cancer, due to their mortality
burden on developed biomedical arena. In the present experimental
setup, chicken breast tissue was used to study the efficiency of imaging
for Gd-based graphene samples as a viable contrast agent. In the presence
of GO and Gd-rGONS molecules, there is an enhanced scattering of the
penetrating light, thereby helping in the visualization of the inner
structure of the tissue sample. The penetration of GO and Gd-rGONSs
was studied over a period of 55 min, with the appropriate images acquired
every 15 min. Figure 5A shows cross-sectional OCT image of the tissue samples with the
application of GO and Gd-rGONSs as contrast agent with time. A qualitative
estimation may lead to the conclusion that the rate of penetration
of the Gd-rGONSs is lower than that of GO. The quantitative analysis
of the intensity profile (A scan) with respect to penetration depth
at different time intervals is presented in Figure 6a,b. The A-scan profiles for the OCT image
with GO does not show a sharp peak until 55 min of time, while for
Gd-rGONSs, the same is visible within 30 min of the application mark.
Both molecules demonstrate sufficient penetration into the tissue
with efficient backscattering, for visualization purposes. However,
Gd-rGONSs show superior contrast ability, with a higher scattering
factor than GO. This property may be attributed to its various surface
modifications, which in turn increase the effective surface area for
active optical backscattering of the incident light. The enhancement
in brightness of the surface layer for Gd-rGONSs progressively increases
with time compared to GO. This is significantly beneficial to enhance
the contrast between the surface and the inner layers.

breast tissue segments with GO NSs at different
exposure time intervals and with Gd-rGONSs at different exposure time
intervals (A), linear fitting plot of 1/T1 versus Gd concentration in mM and the slope of which gave the value
of r1 for Gd-rGONSs (B1) and T1-weighted phantom MR images of pure water and Gd-rGONSs
dispersant at various concentrations: 0.00, 0.04, 0.08, 0.12, 0.17,
and 0.21 mM (from top to bottom) (B2); Milli-Q water was used as control
(0.00 mM).

Figure 6 (a) Single average A-scan profiles indicating
signal obtained from
deeper layer of the tissue (epimysium) for GO. (b) Single average
A-scan profiles indicating signal obtained from deeper layer of the
tissue (epimysium) for Gd-rGONSs.

After obtaining tissue morphologies due to intrinsic scattering
differences using OCT, the scattering coefficient was estimated for
the samples, as shown in the scattering A-scan profiles in Figure 6a,b. The estimated
value of scattering coefficient for GO was found to be ∼4.5
mm–1 at 55 min, compared to ∼18 mm–1 for Gd-rGONSs during the same time period. This difference is attributed
to the surface functionalization of GO, which induces a greater number
of locations for interaction with the surrounding tissue and thereby
reducing the rate of penetration. It is observed that the penetration
of GO and Gd-rGONSs inside the tissue is nearly similar. However,
penetration rate of Gd is higher due to its smaller structure. It
must be noted that the A-scans taken at different times are also the
same of different regions of the sample. To alleviate this concern,
the solution was evenly applied to the sample. But due to the different
densities in the sample at different locations, the rate of penetration
is shown to be different. It must however be noted that from Figures 6 and 7, it can be estimated that the Gd-rGONSs have a lower rate
of penetration than GO. This may be attributed to the higher interaction
between the sample tissue and the Gd-rGONSs because of the latter’s
greater surface area and hence greater interaction. But from Figure 7A,B, it can also
be estimated that due to the lower penetration rate, Gd-rGONS samples
also provide a greater contrast, but are suited for applications where
shallow depth imaging is recommended. Figure 8 shows average change in scattering coefficients
of tissue for GO and Gd-rGONSs as exogeneous contrast agent. Gd-rGONSs
shows better scattering coefficient with respect to time in comparison
to GO, and hence acts as a better contrast agent. Due to the higher
optical backscattering afforded by the Gd-rGONS samples and the use
of Gd-based compounds for MRI contrast enhancements, a study of the
contrast and depth penetration of the proposed novel compound may
also be conducted using magneto motive OCT (MMOCT) for diagnostic
and therapeutic purposes.

3.4 T1 and T2 Relaxivity for in Vitro MR Imaging
The longitudinal relaxivity of Gd-rGONSs as a T1 MRI contrast agent was measured from the linear plot map
of 1/T1 versus Gd concentration under
the applied magnetic field of 1.5 T. The slope of the plot gives the
corresponding relaxivity (r1) value (Figure 5B1). The five different
aqueous dispersants of 0.04, 0.08, 0.12, 0.17, and 0.21 mM concentrations
were prepared for scanning the samples (Figure 5B2). The r1 value
for Gd-rGONSs was calculated to be 16.85 mM–1 s–1, which was 4 times larger than the commercially used
clinical contrast agent Magnevist (4 mM–1 s–1) at a magnetic field strength of 1.5 T.46 In this work, the obtained value of r1 for Gd-rGONSs was significantly higher than
the relaxivity values achieved by available commercial and reported
contrast agents in the literature (Table S2). One of the reasons for obtaining higher relaxivity value being
the effective surface area provided by the graphene nanosheets and
the uniform distribution of the contrast moieties over the surface.
This effectively enhances the contrast ability by reducing the TR,
acquisition time, and required magnetic field strength. The other
major implication of this sample would be for reduced dosage as even
at the lower concentration and magnetic field strength, the obtained
relaxivities are higher than the previously reported study, which
used a magnetic field strength of 11.7 T (Table S2).

4 Conclusions
Gd3+ ions-decorated rGO samples having multifunctional
efficiency were engineered. The synthesized Gd-rGONSs were found to
enhance loading of 5-FU than its GO counterpart. The release was sustained
and found to be ∼92% in 72 h. The contrast was enhanced for
Gd-rGONSs than GO for OCT imaging studies. The synthesized Gd-rGONSs
could also be used for future studies with magneto motive OCT bioimaging
and simultaneously as drug delivery nanovehicle for ocular surface
squamous neoplasia and other ocular diseases. The suitability of Gd-rGONSs
as promising T1 contrast agent for MRI
adds to its applicability for magnet-induced imaging. The designed
Gd3+ ions-decorated rGONSs showed 4 times enhanced relaxivity
value (r1) at 1.5 T magnetic field. The
larger value was dependent on the effective surface area provided
by the nanosheets of rGO matrix and the uniform distribution of the
Gd3+ ions on both sides of the surface inducing contrast
density enhancement. Further, the Gd-rGONS designed samples showed
no leaching of Gd3+ ions estimated spectroscopically and
through elemental detection. The Gd3+ ions in their free
form are mainly responsible for various organ and specifically renal
dysfunction, whose toxicity has been prevented strongly through designing
of the appropriate surface functionalization groups of Gd-rGONSs.
Overall, engineering such Gd-rGONSs and their synthesis approach combine
to provide a comprehensive basis for development of new-generation
multimodal nanocarrier as an active candidate for drug delivery via
optical and magnetic imaging techniques whose feature make it highly
recommendable and relevant for therapy and diagnosis simultaneously
making it theranostic nanosystems.
