We
describe a cascade Wacker/allylation sequence of β-hydroxy
ynones by directly using simple allylic alcohols. This palladium(II)-catalyzed
reaction occurs under mild conditions (0 °C to room temperature)
and provides a new and efficient synthetic method for the preparation
of allylated dihydropyrones. The regiochemical outcomes are consistent
with a reaction pathway that includes an insertion/β-OH elimination
sequence to form the allylic moiety. A remarkable changeover from
allyl to formylethyl products occurs under the simple action of LiBr.

==== Body
Introduction
Allylic alcohols are
well recognized as versatile building blocks
for the construction of functionalized carbon frameworks by palladium-catalyzed
reactions,1 including nucleophilic allylic
substitutions2 and Mizoroki–Heck
reactions.3 These reactions are also quite
attractive from the viewpoint of green and atom economically favorable
processes.4 In contrast to the numerous
examples of allylic substitution of nucleophiles via π-allylpalladium
intermediates or introduction of formylethyl groups through Mizoroki–Heck
reactions, allylations via Mizoroki–Heck reactions that directly
use allylic alcohols have been relatively less explored, despite the
straightforwardness of this process (Scheme 1).5

Scheme 1 Direct
Use of Allyl Alcohol in Palladium-Catalyzed Mizoroki–Heck
Reactions
Recently, in the course
of studies aimed at the synthesis of functionalized
dihydropyrones, we discovered, by chance, a new cascade reaction with
allyl alcohol (Scheme 2). In this reaction, β-hydroxy ynone 1 underwent
a palladium-catalyzed cascade sequence, including Wacker-type cyclization
and subsequent allylation with allyl alcohol (cascade Wacker/allylation
sequence) under mild conditions (0 °C to room temperature), providing
allyl dihydropyrone 2a in good yield. Herein, we report
this cascade Wacker/allylation sequence,6 which offers a new and efficient entry to functionalized dihydropyrones.7,8 We also report that addition of LiBr allowed remarkable product
changeover from allyl dihydropyrone 2a to formylethyl
derivative 3, provided via a conventional Mizoroki–Heck
reaction (Scheme 2).

Scheme 2 Cascade Reactions with Allyl Alcohol
Results and Discussion
We first examined
a cascade Wacker/Mizoroki–Heck sequence with allyl alcohol
according to the conditions for a related reaction reported by Gouverneur
and co-workers.9 In this reaction, readily
available β-hydroxy ynone 1 (for details, see the Supporting Information) was subjected to catalytic
amounts of (MeCN)2PdCl2 and Cu(OAc)2·H2O (10 mol % each) in the presence of LiBr (4.0
equiv) to provide aldehyde 3 in 72% yield, as anticipated
(Table 1, entry 1).
Unexpectedly, in the absence of LiBr, the reaction resulted in the
exclusive formation of allyl dihydropyrone 2a in 78%
yield; no aldehyde 3 was observed, even in the crude
mixture, as judged by 1H NMR analysis (entry 2). These
results indicate that LiBr plays an important role in the remarkable
changeover between products 3 and 2a. It
is likely that both components of LiBr contribute to the formation
of 3 in good yield. Indeed, formation of aldehyde 3 without formation of allylated 2a also proceeded
in lower yields in the presence of other additives, such as LiCl,
tetrabutylammonium salts, NaBr, and KBr (entries 3–8), but
not in the presence of the more Lewis acidic LiBF4 (entry
9) (for details, see the Supporting Information).

Further experiments
were then conducted to elucidate the details
of this cascade Wacker/allylation sequence. Control experiments established
that allylated product 2a was observed only in the presence
of (MeCN)2PdCl2, irrespective of the introduction
of oxygen and Cu(OAc)2·H2O (Table 2). Among the Pd(II) complexes
we have examined, (MeCN)2PdCl2 and (PhCN)2PdBr2 were effective precatalysts (Table 3). It is also of interest to
note that the reaction with (PhCN)2PdBr2 resulted
in the exclusive formation of 2a in 70% yield, with no
aldehyde 3 observed, despite the presence of bromide
in the reaction system (entry 4). Furthermore, the use of Pd(OAc)2 and Pd(OCOCF3)2 resulted in the formation
of protonated dihydropyrone 4 in 5 and 71% yields, respectively
(entries 5 and 6). The reaction did not proceed with Pd(0) complexes,
such as Pd(PPh3)4 and Pd2(dba)3·CHCl3 (entries 7 and 8). The use of various
organic solvents, such as Et2O, CH2Cl2, tetrahydrofuran (THF), toluene, dimethylformamide (DMF), MeOH,
and MeCN, for this transformation provided 2a in 42–69%
yields (for details, see the Supporting Information).

We next investigated the effect
of the allylic alcohol structure
on the cascade Wacker/allylation sequence (Table 4). Secondary and tertiary vinyl carbinols,
such as 3-buten-2-ol and 2-methyl-3-buten-2-ol, underwent the cascade
Wacker/allylation sequence to provide the corresponding products 2b and 2c in 57 and 51% yields, respectively
(entries 1 and 2); no aldehyde or regioisomeric products of the Mizoroki–Heck
reaction were formed. In these reactions, only representative γ-isomers
were formed, which strongly indicates that the reaction proceeds through
insertion/β-OH elimination,1 rather
than allylation via a π-allylpalladium intermediate.2c,10 Reaction with methallyl alcohol proceeded at 0 °C to afford
the corresponding product 2d in 29% yield (entry 3).
A terminal substituent in allylic alcohols retarded the reaction; E-crotyl alcohol was found to afford the corresponding product 2e as a single regioisomer, with a decreased yield of 21%
(entry 4). A limitation of this cascade sequence is that allylic alcohols
having a trisubstituted alkene provided poor results; the reaction
with sterically congested prenyl alcohol afforded undesired dihydrofuran 5 (Figure 1) in 13% yield, instead of reverse-prenyl product 2f (entry 5).

alcohol.

f Dihydrofuran 5 (Figure 1) was obtained in

The cascade Wacker/allylation
sequence was applicable to the construction
of several allylated dihydropyrones (Table 5). The cascade reaction proceeded with ynone 6 bearing a siloxy functional group to give 7 in 74% yield (entry 1). Hydroxy ynones 8 and 10 bearing a sterically congested substituent (phenyl or TMS
group) on the terminus of the alkyne underwent the reaction smoothly
to provide 9 and 11 in moderate yields of
55 and 57%, respectively (entries 2 and 3). Moreover, the cascade
sequence with 12 having a terminal alkyne afforded expected
dihydropyrone 13 in 37% yield (entry 4). Primary alcohol 14 also underwent the cascade reaction to provide 15 in 75% yield (entry 5). In most cases, reactions at 0 °C could
suppress side reactions and provided higher yield of products (entries
2–5). In contrast, cyclization using 2-(3-phenylpropynoyl)phenol 16 did not proceed to give 3-allyl flavone-type scaffold 17 but provided the unreacted substrate probably due to the
less nucleophilic phenolic hydroxy group (entry 6).

b Reaction was carried out at

c Ynone 16 was recovered

A plausible
mechanism for the present cascade reaction is proposed
in Scheme 3. β-Hydroxy
ynone A undergoes oxypalladation with palladium(II) species,
leading to alkenylpalladium(II) intermediate B bearing
a dihydropyrone scaffold, which engages in sequential insertion of
the C=C bond of allyl alcohol to generate alkylpalladium(II)
intermediate C.9 Then, the
presence of excess LiBr may facilitate β-H elimination probably
through coordination of LiBr as a Lewis acid to the primary hydroxy
group.11,12 Palladium(0) species could then be oxidized
by Cu(II)/O2 to regenerate PdX2. On the other
hand, in the absence of LiBr, C or its cationic intermediate C′ undergoes β-OH eliminationa to form allylated dihydropyrone F along with
Pd(OH)Cl. No reoxidant is required for this process, as PdX2 could be regenerated through dehydration of Pd(OH)Cl with a proton.

Scheme 3 Possible Reaction Mechanism for the Present Cascade Reactions
Conclusions
In
conclusion, we have described a new cascade Wacker/allylation
sequence starting from β-hydroxy ynones and occurring under
mild conditions in a single operation by directly using allylic alcohols.
This new reaction offers a very convenient entry to functionalized
dihydropyrones of synthetic value. Additionally, a remarkable changeover
from allyl and formylethyl products occurs under the simple action
of LiBr. Further studies of the present cascade reaction, including
generalities of direct allylation with aryl- or alkenylmetals and
LiBr-promoted product changeover, as well as its application to the
synthesis of natural products, are in progress.

Hydroxy
Ynone 14
This compound was synthesized
according to a modified procedure of Moody et al.14 To a solution of diisopropylamine (0.80 mL, 5.7 mmol) in
THF (28.5 mL) was added n-BuLi (1.6 M in hexane,
3.6 mL, 5.8 mmol) at −78 °C under an argon atmosphere.
The reaction mixture was stirred at −78 °C for 1.5 h.
To the reaction mixture was added dropwise a solution of oct-3-yn-2-one
(0.55 mL, 3.8 mmol) at −78 °C. After being stirred at
−78 °C for 2 h, TMSCl (1.0 mL, 7.6 mmol) was added dropwise
to the resulting mixture. The resulting mixture was allowed to warm
to 0 °C. The reaction was quenched with a saturated aqueous solution
of NaHCO3 at 0 °C. The aqueous layer was extracted
with Et2O. The organic layer was dried over anhydrous Na2SO4 and concentrated. This crude residue was used
for the next reaction without further purification. To a solution
of the residue in THF (20 mL) was added formalin (1.4 mL) at room
temperature under an argon atmosphere. The reaction mixture was cooled
to 0 °C. To the reaction mixture was added Sc(OTf)3 (187 mg, 0.380 mmol). After being stirred at 0 °C for 3 h,
the resulting mixture was allowed to warm to room temperature. After
being stirred at room temperature for 22 h, the reaction was quenched
with H2O at 0 °C. The aqueous layer was extracted
with EtOAc. The organic layer was dried over anhydrous Na2SO4 and concentrated. The residue was purified by silica
gel column chromatography (hexane/EtOAc = 2:1) to give 14 (415 mg, 70%) as a colorless oil. IR (KBr) νmax (cm–1) 2920, 2850, 1730, 1462, 1377; 1H NMR (CDCl3, 400 MHz) δ (ppm) 3.94–3.86

a Lu and co-workers reported the related
allylation of an arylpalladium complex with allylic alcohol. Further,
in AcOH, the addition of LiCl favors β-OH-elimination over β-H-elimination.

Lei and co-workers
demonstrated the strong influence of additives in the palladium-catalyzed
cross-coupling of arylboronic acid and allylic alcohols. They also
proposed that similar coordination between a Lewis acid and the free
hydroxy group would facilitate the formation of an aldehyde via β-H
elimination. Chen M. ; Wang J. ; Chai Z. ; You C. ; Lei A.
