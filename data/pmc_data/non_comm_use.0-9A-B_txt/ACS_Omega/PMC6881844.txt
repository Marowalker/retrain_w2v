Practical methods for the preparation of selectively
fluorinated
compounds are in extremely high demand in nearly every sector of the
pharmaceutical and agrochemical industries. Here we provided an account
of the recent methodological breakthrough dealing with detrifluoroacetylative
in situ generation of cyclic fluoro-enolates and their application
for the preparation of various polyfunctional compounds featuring
quaternary C–F stereogenic carbon. The reactions include aldol,
Mannich, Michael
addition reactions, SN2/SN2′ alkylations,
and the additions to azo compounds. The detrifluoroacetylative protocol
for in situ generation of cyclic fluoro-enolates is operationally
simple and scalable and proceeds at ambient temperature. Generally,
the stereochemical outcome, controlled by the stoichiometric chiral
auxiliary of the chiral catalyst, is synthetically useful, allowing
preparation of enantiomerically pure compounds of high pharmaceutical
potential.

1 Introduction
Due to the remarkable
performance of fluorine-containing drugs
and agrochemicals, synthesis of fluoro-organic compounds is currently
one of the most rapidly developing areas of organic chemistry.1 The properties of fluorine confer unmatched flexibility
among
the elements commonly used in drug design, with the majority of
the effects falling into three general categories: First, the modified
reactivity and metabolism, as in the increased stability toward oxidative
degradation and design of mechanism-based enzyme inhibitors. Second,
the modified physicochemical properties, as in the control of acidity/basicity,
lipophilicity, and membrane permeability. Finally, the fine-tuning
of three-dimensional structure and conformations using electrostatic
and hydrogen-bonding properties of fluorine atoms.2 Considering the ever-increasing number of fluorinated marketed
drugs, it would be reasonable to assume that fluorine editing/fluorine
scanning will become a mainstream paradigm in modern drug design.3

However, the progress in the development
of fluoro-organic methodology
has been rather uneven. For example, enantio-controlled synthesis
of compounds possessing carbon–fluorine quaternary stereogenic
carbons is still a challenging endeavor. As a reflection of this methodological
predicament, the pharmaceuticals featuring quaternary C–F stereogenic
centers are exceptionally rare. Motivated by this synthetic
deficiency, we joined the efforts of many other research groups4 focusing on the development of modern, advanced
procedures for practical preparation of quaternary C–F compounds
in enantiomerically pure form. In this mini-review we
provide a brief summary of the discovery and development of detrifluoroacetylative
in situ generation of cyclic fluoro-enolates and their synthetic applications.

2 Synthesis and Detrifluoroacetylative in Situ
Generation of Cyclic Fluoro-enolates
The cyclic ketone-based 1 and cyclic amide-based hydrates 2 (Figure 1) were developed
by Han, Soloshonok, and co-workers, and these two
trifluorinated ketone hydrates contain a fluoro atom at the α-position,
which were used as the precursors for the detrifluoroacetylative in
situ generation of cyclic fluoro-enolates.5,6

Figure 1 Hydrates 1 and 2.

The cyclic-ketone-based hydrate 1 was
synthesized
via two steps with cyclic ketones 3 as the starting materials
(Scheme 1).5 First, the cyclic ketone 3 reacted
with ethyl trifluoroacetate in the presence of sodium methoxide in
ether at room temperature for 24 h, affording the intermediate 4. Then, intermediate 4 was treated by Selectfluor
in acetonitrile at room temperature for 24 h to give the desired hydrates 1 in good chemical yields. The cyclic-amide-based hydrates 2 were prepared via the similar two-step method with oxindoles 6 as the starting materials. Only one modification was needed,
and it involved substitution of sodium hydride for sodium methoxide
in the first step as the oxindoles containing a less acidic C–H
bond.

Scheme 1 Synthesis of Enolate Precursors 1 and 2 and Detrifluoroacetylative in Situ Generation of Enolates 5 and 8
These hydrates (1 and 2) underwent
the C–C bond cleavage in the presence of organic base to give
the fluoro-enolates
(5 and 8) via the release of trifluoroacetic
acid.

3 Aldol Addition Reactions
3.1 Keto-Type Enolates
As shown in Scheme 1, the β-keto-α-fluorohydrates 1 could easily undergo the C–C bond cleavage with the
release of trifluoroacetic acid in the presence
of organic base, resulting in the fluoro-enolates, potentially versatile
nucleophiles in asymmetric organic transformations. The first synthetic
application of hydrates 1 was the Cu-catalyzed aldol
reaction with aromatic aldehydes, which was reported by the Han group
in 2015 (Scheme 2).5 These detrifluoroacetylative aldol reactions
were carried out with the combination of copper triflate and bidentate
bis(oxazoline) 9 as chiral catalyst and DIPEA as base
in THF at 0–20 °C. The reactions showed wide substrate
scope and tolerated
various substation patterns (34 substrates), providing the corresponding
products, bearing C–F quaternary stereogenic centers, in 75–96%
yield, 40–98% de, and 67–97% ee. It should be mentioned
that the cyclic keto hydrates 1 bearing five-membered,
six-membered, seven-membered, and even heterocyclic
rings were all well tolerated in this asymmetric transformation with
excellent outcomes.

Scheme 2 Asymmetric Aldol Reactions of Hydrates 1 with Aromatic
Aldehydes
Here we would like to focus the readers’
attention on the
self-disproportionation of enantiomer (SDE) phenomenon and problems
associated with an accurate determination of enantiomeric purity of
products obtained in catalytic asymmetric transformations in general7 and fluorine-containing chiral compounds in particular.8 The SDE phenomenon is ubiquitous in nature,9 always taking place when an enantiomerically
enriched compound is subjected to any type of physicochemical phase
transition.10 Of particular relevance to
organic synthesis are the SDE cases via sublimation and achiral chromatography.11 In these asymmetric aldol reactions, a relatively
high magnitude of the SDE phenomenon was detected.5 As reported, one aldol product with an initial 84% ee was
subjected to the achiral chromatography, which provided an enantiomerically
enriched first fractions (88% ee) and correspondingly enantiomerically
depleated last fractions (77% ee).

After the synthetically useful
results were obtained for the detrifluoroacetylative
aldol reactions with aromatic aldehydes, Han, Soloshonok, and co-workers
tried to extend this reaction by using usually less reactive aliphatic
aldehydes as the starting materials (Scheme 3).12 The reaction
conditions were carefully optimized, and the use of Cu(OTf)2/ligand 9 was demonstrated to be the best one. A series
of aliphatic aldehydes worked well in this asymmetric aldol reaction
and provided the corresponding aldol adducts 11 in good
yields and high stereoselectivities. It should be mentioned that the
byproduct 12 was observed in almost all the cases with
the yields
from 5% to >80%. For the selected examples, the aldehydes with
low
steric hindrance, such as n-butylaldehyde and n-octylaldehyde, good yields of products 11, and less than 10% yields of byproducts 12 were obtained.
However, in the case of bulky aldehydes, almost no alodol adducts
(11c or 11d) were observed, and >80%
yield
of byproducts was isolated.

Scheme 3 Asymmetric Aldol Reactions of Hydrates 1 with Aliphatic
Aldehydes
In 2017, the Han group developed a cascade detrifluoroacetylative
aldol/intramolecular cyclization/oxidation reaction between hydrates 1 and ortho-phthalaldehyde (Scheme 4).13 Initially, compound 13 was designed as the corresponding
product via the reaction sequence of detrifluoroacetylation, aldol,
and cyclization in the presence of triethylamine and lithium bromide.
However, reversibility of the cyclization of intermediate 13 resulted in poor diastereoselectivity. Thus, direct in situ oxidation
with the addition of pyrindium chlorochromate (PCC) was conducted,
which successfully provided the desired lactone derivatives in 46–84%
yields and 56:44–89:11 diastereoselectivities. In this work,
the authors also tried the
asymmetric catalytic reactions of hydrates 1 and ortho-phthalaldehyde with Cu(OTf)2 as catalyst
and bis(oxazoline) 9 as chiral ligand. However, very
poor enantioselectivities were detected.

Scheme 4 Asymmetric Aldol/Cyclization/Oxidation
Reactions of Hydrates 1 with ortho-Phthalaldehyde
As the fluorine-containing β-keto-ester 14 backbone
shows the high pharmaceutical potential, the Han group continued their
interests to develop the detrifluoroacetylative methodology to assemble
these compounds. They found that using 2-formylbenzoate, instead of ortho-phthalaldehyde, could solve the reversibility problem,
thus providing an excellent outcome (Scheme 5).14 After careful
optimization of reaction conditions, the combination of Cu(OTf)2/ligand 9 was chosen as the best one, and the
reaction proceeded smoothly to give the corresponding product 14 in good yields and high diastereo- and enantioselectivities.
Furthermore, this reaction showed wide substrate scope, and a total
of 25 examples were scrutinized in this system. Several kinds of γ-lactones
and δ-lactones containing C–F quaternary stereogenic
centers were synthesized under mild reaction conditions.

Aldol/Cyclization Reactions of Hydrates 1 with 2-Formylbenzoate
3.2 Indole-Type Enolates
As a continuation
of work on the asymmetric aldol reactions of the β-keto-α-fluorohydrates 1, the cyclic-amide-based hydrates 2 were then
used as the precursors of the corresponding fluoro amide-enolates 8 in the aldol reaction in 2017.15 Compared with the aldol reaction of hydrates 1,12−14 this reaction used CuI as the
metal catalyst and phenyl-substituted bis(oxazoline) 15 as the chiral ligand. Based on the studies of optimization of reaction
conditions, the solvent played a key role in the reaction outcome,
and the use of a cosolvent THF/i-PrOH (1:1) provided
the best results. Under
the optimized conditions, a wide range of aldehydes, including aromatic
and aliphatic aldehydes, worked very well, affording the desired products 16 in 29–93% yields, 57:43–91:9 diastereoselectivities,
and 18–92% enantioselectivities. In particular, one hydrate-containing
unprotected N-H moiety also was well tolerated in
the system and reacted
with benzaldehyde smoothly to give the product in 74% yield (Scheme 6).

Scheme 6 Asymmetric Aldol
Reactions of Hydrates 2
4 Mannich Addition Reactions
4.1 Keto-Type Enolates
Our previous experience
with chiral N-sulfinylimines16 was exceptionally positive in terms of the synthetic versatility
and generally observed stereochemical outcome in addition reactions
with various C-nucleophiles,17 including acyclic fluoro-enolates.18

Thus, these fluorohydrates 1 were studied as nucleophiles
for the Mannich reactions with chiral N-sulfinylimines.
It was found that the asymmetric Mannich additions did happen and
provided the targeted C–F quaternary α-fluoroalkyl-β-keto-amines
(Scheme 7).19 The optimization studies of the asymmetric Mannich
reaction showed that it could be conducted under very operationally
simple conditions with the addition of triethylamine and lithium bromide
at low temperature (−40 °C). It should be mentioned that
these reactions were completed
within 5 min and afforded the corresponding products (S)(1S,1’S)-18 in excellent yields and high
diastereoselectivities (43–99% yield, 93:7–>98:2
dr). For the reactions of chiral CF3-sulfinylimine, several
hydrates 1 bearing electron-withdrawing or electron-donating
group substituted aromatic rings worked very well under optimized
conditions. Besides CF3-sulfinylimine, other sulfinylimines 17 containing CF2Cl, CF2Br, C2F5, C3F7, and C4F9 have also been tried in this system. These reactions also
could be completed within 5 min, affording the desired products with
a similarly high stereochemical
outcome.

Scheme 7 Asymmetric Mannich Reactions of Hydrates 1 and Fluoroalkyl
Imines
The N-protecting group was easily
removed in the
presence of hydrochloric acid and then was treated by triethylamine
in dichloromethane, which provided the free chiral α-trifluoromethyl-α-fluoro-β-keto-amine
in 92% yield.

4.2 Indole-Type Enolates
After successful
results obtained from the asymmetric detrifluoroacetylative Mannich
reactions of hydrates 1 and fluoroalkyl imines, hydrates 2 were used as nucleophiles for this Mannich reaction (Scheme 8).6 It was found that the reactions between hydrates 2 and imine 17 could be carried out under similar
conditions,19 being completed within 5
min
or less. The reactions showed wide substrate scope, and all of the
32 examples bearing various types of substituents were well tolerated,
affording the corresponding products in excellent and high diastereoselectivities
(79–97%
yield, 92:8–>98:2 dr). In particular, only one diastereomer
was observed for the cases of CF2Cl-, CF2Br-,
C2F5-, C3F7-, and C4F9-containing imines. The sulfinyl group in the
products can be conveniently removed under the acidic conditions.
When the (R)-imine was used as the starting material,
the product with opposite absolute configuration (3R,2′R)-20a was obtained with
the
same level of chemical and stereochemical outcome.

Scheme 8 Asymmetric Mannich
Reactions of Hydrates 2 and Fluoroalkyl
Imines
The less electrophilic, nonfluorinated imines 21 can also be used as Mannich acceptors in
the addition reaction with hydrates 2 (Scheme 9).20 These transformations took a bit longer time for completion (10
min),
being conducted in the presence of triethylamine and lithium bromide,
resulting in the corresponding products 22 in good to
excellent yields (64–96%). Several types of imines, bearing
aromatic, alkyl, alkenyl, and alkynyl
groups, worked very well in this detrifluoroacetylative Mannich reaction
and afforded only one diastereomer for all the cases (all >98:2
dr). It should be mentioned that hydrates 2 bearing N-H, N-Me, N-allyl, and
even N-Ph moieties were all well tolerated in this
reaction. These reactions were shown to proceed via the chelated transition
states involving the Li coordination to the S–O oxygen.

Imines
5 Michael Additions
After the development
of aldol and Mannich reactions for these
two types of enolate precursors, the Han and Soloshonok group turned
their attention to detrifluoroacetylative Michael addition reactions.
Initially, they used various types of α,β-unsaturated
carbonyl derivatives, including quite reactive N-(enoyl)oxazolidinones,
as Michael acceptors for the in situ generated fluoro-enolates. However,
no positive results were obtained in these reactions.21 Then, (ethene-1,1-diyldisulfonyl)dibenzene (23) was used as a Michael acceptor to react with hydrates 1 under the Cu-catalyzed conditions.5 After
careful
scan of the chiral ligands, (1S,2S)-1,2-diphenylethane-1,2-diamine 24, bearing a sterically
bulky anthracenyl group, was demonstrated to be the best in catalyzing
the reaction with 2-fluoro-2-(2,2,2-trifluoro-1,1-dihydroxyethyl)-3,4-dihydronaphthalen-1(2H)-one (1a). The addition proceeded smoothly
to give the desired product in 99% yield and 93% ee. The substrate
structural generality of hydrates 1 was examined, showing
that different substituents on the aromatic ring had almost no effect
on the reaction outcome, resulting in 86–99% yields and 60–96%
enantioselectivities. This method provides an easy access to γ-sulfonyl-α-fluoroketones
containing quaternary C–F stereogenic carbon centers 25 (Scheme 10).

Scheme 10 Asymmetric Michael Reactions of Hydrates 1
In 2019, Han and coauthors extended this detrifluoroacetylative
Michael reaction and used the
indole-based hydrates 2 as the nucleophiles instead of
ketone-based hydrates 1.22 The reaction was conducted under similar conditions, using the combination
of Cu(OTf)2/ligand 24 as a catalyst and DIPEA
as a base in THF at −20 °C. These reactions afforded the
corresponding products in
excellent yields and high enantioselectivities.

6 Alkylation Reactions
In 2017, Han,
Soloshonok, and coauthors further explored the chemistry of detrifluoroacetylative-generated
fluoro-enolates to the alkylation reactions. They found that hydrates 2 could react with Morita–Baylis–Hillman carbonates 26 in the presence of organic base and lithium bromide at
room temperature (Scheme 11).23 Different from the previous
reports,5,6 1,1,3,3-tetramethyl guanidine (TMG) was
found to be the best base in catalyzing the reaction which afforded
the corresponding products 27 in excellent yields and
stereoselectivities (80–95% yield, 85:15 →
99:1 E/Z). The reaction also showed a wide substrate scope,
and a variety of substitution patterns on hydrates 2 and
Morita–Baylis–Hillman carbonates 26 were
all well tolerated in this detrifluoroacetylative protocol.

Scheme 11 SN2′ Alkylation Reactions of Hydrates 2
As one can expect, the nucleophilic substitution
reaction could
take place at two positions (Figure 2). Notably, this reaction proceeded in a highly chemoselective
manner resulting in the SN2′ products 27, and almost no SN2 products were detected.

Figure 2 Possible reaction
pathways in the alkylation reaction.

Then, the authors continued their studies to find
an appropriate
condition to obtain the corresponding SN2 products 29. It was found that the reaction selectively gave the SN2 products with the Pd2(dba)3/SKP-type
ligand 28 as a catalyst, TMG as a base, and 1-propanol
as a solvent at room temperature for 12 h (Scheme 12).24 The reaction
proceeded smoothly, and the examined 24 variously substituted substrates
all showed excellent chemoselectivity with more than 10:1 ratio of 29:27.

Scheme 12 SN2 Alkylation Reactions
of Hydrates 2
Importantly, the hydrates 2 were
shown to have clear
synthetic advantage over 3-fluoro-1-methylindolin-2-one (30) as the fluoro-enolate precursor in the synthesis of fluorine-containing
compounds bearing a C–F quaternary stereogenic center. Thus,
under the same reaction conditions,
substrate 30 gave lower yield and enantioselectivity
of the corresponding alkylation product 29a (60% yield
and 63% ee) (Scheme 13).

Scheme 13 SN2 Alkylation Reactions of 30
7 Reactions with Azo-Compounds
An unusual
detrifluoroacetylative reaction between hydrates 2 and
diethyl azodicarboxylate was reported in 2017. Under
the typical detrifluoroacetylative reaction conditions, the in situ
generated 3-fluoroindolin-2-one enolates derived from hydrates 2 reacted with diethyl azodicarboxylates to afford isatin
hydrazone derivatives (Scheme 14).25 Several hydrates, bearing
various substituents on the aromatic ring, were tried in this reaction,
resulting in 58–81% yield of products 31.

Scheme 14 Reactions of Hydrates 2 and 30
It is interesting that the loss of the C–F
bond in products 31 was obtained instead of the regular
addition process. A plausible mechanistic rationale is provided in Scheme 15. It is assumed
that the Michael addition of enolate to azodicarboxylates gives intermediate 32, which exists in equilibrium with more stable intermediate 33. The latter undergoes intramolecular substitution with
the C–F bond cleavage affording intermediate 34. Finally, the
nucleophilic attack on the carbonyl group of the ester and ring opening
give the final product 31.

Scheme 15 Proposed Mechanism
8 Conclusions
The data discussed in this
mini-review on the discovery and development
of detrifluoroacetylative generation of cyclic fluoro-enolates underscore
the methodological potential of these intermediates for the preparation
of structurally complex compounds bearing quaternary stereogenic C–F
centers. The reaction-type chemistry for these in situ generated
enolates is shown on the examples of asymmetric aldol, Mannich, Michael
additions, and alkylation reactions. It is particularly noteworthy
that the detrifluoroacetylative conditions are compatible with catalytic
enantioselective transformations, requiring formation, also in situ,
of the corresponding catalytic species. The most attractive features
of this approach, such as the operational convenience, substrate generality,
and, in most cases, excellent stereochemical outcome bode well for
its widespread application for the preparation of C–F containing
biologically relevant compounds.
