A tung-oil-based polyphenol (ATOM), containing the phenolic
hydroxyl
group, was synthesized from tung oil and 4-maleimidophenol by the
Diels–Alder addition reaction. Then self-healing thermosetting
polyurethanes were prepared from ATOM and the polyurethane prepolymer.
The chemical structure and cross-link network were confirmed by Fourier
transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and swelling tests. The products
partially dissolved in trichlorobenzene when the temperature rose
to 110 °C. Temperature-variable FTIR confirmed that the phenolic
urethane starts to partially dissolve at 100 °C, which can be
explained by the experimental phenomenon in swelling tests. Tensile
property analysis showed that the broken and healed thermosets maintained
about 46–64% of their original tensile strengths and 81–88%
of their original elongations at break, respectively.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Thermosetting polyurethanes
are extensively used in coatings and
adhesives because of their thermal stability and solvent resistance.
However, the annually increasing industrial demand of polyurethanes
has led to the dump of abundant polyurethane materials.1−5 The stable cross-linking network of thermosetting polyurethanes
accounts for their implasticity and unrecoverability, which lead to
resource waste and environmental pollution. For this reason, self-healing
polyurethanes become a new development trend due to the internal ability
to restore physical failures and microcracks.6 Self-healable polyurethanes can be produced through dynamic covalent
bonding (e.g., Diels–Alder (DA) or retro-DA reaction,7−10 esterifcation,11 disulfide bonds,12−15 acylhydrazone bond,16 alkoxyamine chemistry,17 transcarbamoylation,18,19 nitroxides20,21) or noncovalent bonding (e.g.,
H2 bonding,22 π–π
stacking,23 metal-ion binding24). The noncovalent method based on hydrogen bonding
or metal–ligand linking can heal a polymer repeatedly but largely
weakens the noncovalent connection. In comparison, covalent bonds
particularly strengthen the restoring performance of polymers.

Among the dynamic covalent bonds, the disulfide or acylhydrazone
bond and the DA reaction are of high significance for self-healable
polyurethanes. The intrinsic self-repair of the disulfide bond is
based on its instability. Under certain conditions (e.g., temperature,
pH, illumination), the covalent bonds easily break and recombine with
other sulfur atoms to achieve self-repair as well as redox reaction
between the disulfide bond and sulfhydryl groups.12−15 The formation and fracture of
acylhydrazone bonds are reversible under acidic conditions, which
underlie the preparation of hydrogels with a reversible gel–sol
conversion property.25 However, this reversible
reaction only occurs in acidic solutions and does not apply to general
polymer materials. Unlike other essential self-healing approaches,
the DA reaction is suitable for production of self-healing polymers
owing to its gentle conditions, less side reactions, and heat reversibility.
However, the reverse reaction temperature of most DA reactions is
very high, and many reverse reactions can only produce stable aromatic
compounds instead of dienes or dienophiles.26 This is why self-healable polyurethane research on DA reactions
is mostly limited to the reversible DA reactions between maleimide
and furan.7−10 The self-repair capability of polymers is particularly attributed
to these reversible covalent bonds, which must be incorporated to
polymers in the above self-healing systems. Enthetic groups are essentially
important in such a complicated process.

Here, we aimed to clarify
the possibility of producing self-healing
thermosetting polyurethanes. The urethane bonds in common polyurethanes
consisting of isocyanate and alcoholic hydroxyl groups are stable
and undegradable. Similarly, phenolic hydroxyl reacts with isocyanate,
and phenolic urethane can reversibly redegrade into phenol and isocyanate.
Thus, self-repairing thermosetting polyurethanes can be produced without
introducing other special functional groups. As reported, with urushiol,
propyl gallate, catechol, and tert-butylhydroquinone
instead of polyol as polyphenols, Cao et al. prepared a cross-linked
self-healing polyurethane under heating.27,28

Plant oils are valuable eco-friendly feedstock of industrial
materials.
The dry tung oil fatty acids (TOFAs) consist of ∼80% eleostearic
acid with three conjugated double bonds. Noticeably, the DA reaction
between TOFAs and dienophile is very easy.29 The efficient, versatile, and selective DA reaction can also be
conducted to prepare thermosetting polymers. Ideally, the preparation
routes should be efficient and convenient in which industrial bio-feedstock
is often used in accordance with sustainability plans.30,31 Inspired by the reversible reaction between phenolic hydroxyl and
isocyanate, here, we planned to prepare a self-healing and recyclable
thermoset polyurethane via the cross-linked reversible reaction between
tung-oil-based polyphenol (ATOM) and isocyanate. The ATOM was prepared
from natural tung oil in a facile and universal way. This study presents
this bio-friendly substance with a phenolic hydroxyl group and long-chain
structure, which offers high compatibility and thermal self-healing
ability to phenolic polyurethanes.

2 Materials and Methods
2.1 Materials
The tung oil used in this
study was purchased from the Luodian County Anling Vegetable Oil Plant,
China. 4-Maleimidophenol(98%, Tianjin Heowns Biochem LLC, China) and
ethyl acetate (AR, ≥99.5 wt %, Nanjing Chemical Reagent Co.,
Ltd., China) were used as received. Dibutyltin dilaurate (95%) was
obtained from Aladdin Industrial Corporation. Prepolymer (PTHFTDI)
with an NCO content of 6.2%, which compounded from polytetrahydrofuran
and toluene diisocyanate and has a relative molecular weight of 1350,
was obtained from Shanghai Jiren International Trading Co., Ltd.,
China.

2.2 Synthesis
Tung oil can be used to
prepare eleostearic acids, which mainly include the α-isomer
(cis-9,trans-11,trans-13-octadecatrienoic acid) and β-isomer (trans-9,trans-11,trans-13-octadecatrienoic
acid).32 However, the DA reaction only
occurs with the trans–trans conjugated bi-bonds.33,34 To check the content of tung
oil eleostearic acids, we obtained methyl esters of TOFAs via alcoholysis. Figure 1 shows the total
ionization gas chromatograph (GC) and composition of methyl esters
of TOFAs. The methyl esters consisted of 83.77% methyl eleostearates.
Thus, tung oil contained 83.77% eleostearic acids in glyceride.

Figure 1 Gas chromatogram
of methyl esters of tung oil fatty acids.

Figure 2 illustrates
the generation path of the adduct of tung oil and 4-maleimidophenol
(ATOM). According to the eleostearic acid contents in glyceride, the
molar ratio of 4-maleimidophenol to eleostearic acid was 1:1. Tung
oil (100 g) and 4-maleimidophenol (53.74 g) were loaded into a 500
mL four-neck flask for 2.5 h of reaction at 140 °C, forming the
brownish red ATOM.

Figure 2 Design and synthetic scheme for the adduct of tung oil
and 4-maleimidophenol
(ATOM).

2.3 Preparation of Tung-Oil-Based Polyurethanes
At a phenolic hydroxyl to isocyanate molar ratio of 1:1, 0.5% dibutyltin
dilaurate as the catalyst was added to the total mass of polyphenol
and PTHFTDI. After ATOM, PTHFTDI and dibutyltin dilaurate were all
dispersed in ethyl acetate, and the mixed solutions were heated to
50 °C and vacuumed to remove the bubbles (0.098 MPa). The resulting
solutions were poured onto four tetrafluoroethylene plates and cured
at 50 °C/2 h + 80 °C/8 h and 50 °C/2 h + 80 °C/4
h + 120 °C/8 h. The products were labeled PTHFTDI-ATOM-80 and
PTHFTDI-ATOM-120, respectively (abbreviated as PU-80, and PU-120,
respectively). Figure 3 illustrates the reversible cross-linked reactions between phenol
hydroxyls and isocyanates. Figure 4 shows the thermoset polyurethane network from phenol
urethanes.

2.4 Characterization
2.4.1 Gas Chromatogram Analysis(GC)
The
METOFA concentration was detected via an Agilent 7890A GC under the
N2 condition, with acetone as the solvent, and equipped
with an Agilent HP-5 capillary column (Agilent, USA). The oven started
at 100 °C for 1 min, then heated at 10 °C/min to 280 °C,
and held there for 10 min.

2.4.2 Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy
(FTIR)
The chemical structures of tung oil, 4-maleimidophenol,
ATOM, PTHFT, the prepolymer, and the self-healing polyurethane were
determined by an FTIR device (Nicolet IS10 Instrument, USA) within
4000–400 cm–1 in the total reflection mode.

The temperature-variable FTIR was conducted on an IS10 FTIR device
(Nicolet, Waltham, MA, USA). The samples smeared on a NaCl window
plate were cured at 80 or 120 °C for 8 h and then tested from
4000 to 400 cm–1 under the transmission mode. The
temperature program was as follows: 30 °C for 3 min, ramping
to 190 °C, and cooling to 120 °C with holding for 3 min
per 10 °C.

2.4.3 Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR)
The 1H-NMR spectra of tung oil, 4-maleimidophenol, and
ATOM in deuterated chloroform were recorded on an AVANCE III HD 400
MHz spectrometer at ambient temperature.

2.4.4 Thermal Gravimetric Analysis (TGA)
TGA was tested on a NETZSCH STA 409 PC (Netzsch, Germany) from 25
to 600 °C (10 °C/min) and under a nitrogen condition.

2.4.5 Dynamic Mechanical Analysis (DMA)
DMA was performed on a Q800 DMA device (TA Instruments, USA) with
a film tension configuration and oscillation at 1 Hz and from −80
to 180 °C at 3 °C/min. The sample dimensions were about
40 mm (L) × 7 mm (W) ×
0.6 mm (T).

2.4.6 Mechanical Properties
Tensile strength,
Young’s modulus, and elongation at break were detected on a
CMT4303 universal test instrument (SANS, China) as per GB/T 13022-1991
type II at a speed of 100 mm/min and region of 20.0 mm (L) × 4.0 mm (W) × 0.6 mm (T). To ensure accuracy, all samples were detected at 25 °C in
quintuplicate.

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Synthesis and Characterization
Figure 5 shows the FTIR spectra
of tung oil, 4-maleimidophenol, and the adduct of tung oil and maleimidophenol
(ATOM). The characteristic peaks at 3401 and 3477, 3032 and 3112,
and 2924 and 2853 cm–1 corresponded to the stretching
vibrations of phenol hydroxyl, olefin C–H, and methyl and methylene
groups, respectively. The peaks at 1742 and 991 cm–1 were ascribed to the ester group and conjugate double bond, respectively.35 The strong peaks of the conjugate double bonds
at 991 and 1063 cm–1 almost disappeared in the spectra
of ATOM compared with those of tung oil and 4-maleimidophenol, respectively.
The FTIR spectra imply the occurrence of a DA reaction in the double
bonds.

Figure 5 FTIR spectra of tung oil, 4-maleimidophenol, and the adduct of
tung oil and maleimidophenol (ATOM).

The 1H-NMR spectra of tung oil, 4-maleimidophenol,
and
ATOM are shown in Figure 6 in which the attribution of the proton chemical shift is
labeled. Tung oil and ATOM are both in single isomeric structures
(Figure 6). The chemical
shifts of the conjugated triene protons in tung oil are 5.69–5.72,
6.38–6.45, and 6.08–6.20 ppm. Clearly, the peaks at
7.14–7.23 ppm correspond to the double bond of the ester in
the maleimide ring of 4-maleimidophenol. Compared with tung oil and
4-maleimidophenol, the peaks at 6.38–6.45 and 6.08–6.20
ppm ascribed to the conjugated triene protons were nearly not found
in the spectra of ATOM. Nevertheless, the new peaks at 3.2–3.4
ppm imply the presence of a six-atom ring in ATOM. The FTIR and 1H-NMR spectra validate the successful preparation of ATOM.

the adduct of tung oil and maleimidophenol (ATOM).

3.2 Polymerization and Characterizations of the
Self-Healing Network
Figure 3 illustrates the reversible cross-linked reactions
between ATOM and PTHFT. Infrared spectra of PTHFT, ATOM, PTHFT-ATOM
(0 min), PU-80, and PU-120 verified the polymerization (Figure 7). PTHFT-ATOM (0 min) means
that the PTHFT and ATOM are first mixed and ATOM does not undergo
additional reactions with PTHFT. For PTHFT and PTHFT-ATOM (0 min),
the typical peaks at 2266 cm–1 indicate the stretching
vibration of the isocyanate group, and the typical peaks at 1044 and
3340 cm–1 indicate the infrared absorption of phenolic
hydroxyls, respectively. These peaks were not found in the self-repairing
polyurethane PU-80 and PU-120, suggesting that isocyanate was almost
fully utilized by the phenolic hydroxyl. Furthermore, for PU-80 and
PU-120, the strong peak at 1210–1220 cm–1 implies the connection of C=O to N–H.36,37 The infrared spectra validate the ATOM and PTHFT polymerization
as well as the successful generation of the thermoset polyurethane
network based on phenolic hydroxyl.

PU-80, and PU-120.

3.3 Thermal Stability and Mechanical Properties
of PU-80 and PU-120
Figure 8 displays the TGA curves of PU-80 and PU-120 heated
in nitrogen at 10 °C/min, and Table 1 lists the temperature at 5% weight loss
(T5%), the maximum weight losses in the
first and second stages (Tmax-1, Tmax-2), and char yields at
300, 400, and 600 °C (Wres-300, Wres-400, Wres-600). Compared with PU-80, the above five indices
of PU-120 are all slightly larger, suggesting that the thermal stability
of PU-120 is higher than that of PU-80.

Figure 8 TG and TGA curves of
different specimens.

c Wres-300, Wres-400, and Wres-600 are the residue yields at 300, 400, and
600 °C, respectively.

Glass transition temperature (Tg) refers
to the temperature at the peak on the tan δ versus temperature
curve. Viscoelastic characteristics, including tan δ variation
with temperature, are usually detected via DMA. Figure 9 shows the storage modulus (E’) and loss factor (tan δ) of PU-80 and PU-120. The Tg’s of PU-80 and PU-120 are 0.10 and
−2.42 °C, respectively, indicating that the two samples
both have one Tg and these polymer systems
are uniform and congenial. The storage modulus profiles in Figure 5 show that the storage
modulus of PU-120 is higher than that of PU-80 between −80
and −20 °C. The difference of E’
was primarily attributed to the self-structure of the polymer. According
to thermogravimetric analysis, it can be found that the thermal stability
of PU-120 is higher than that of PU-80. This may be due to the fact
that PTHFT and ATOM were cross-linked more fully at higher temperatures.
PU-120 had the higher cross-link density and then exhibited the higher
storage modulus than PU-80 between −80 and −20 °C.

Figure 9 DMA curves
of PU-80 and PU-120.

Cross-linking density (νe) can
be calculated by
the rubber elasticity theory with storage modulus (E’) in the rubber state38,39 1  where T is the temperature
in kelvin (K) and R is the ideal gas constant (8.314
J/mol·K). In this study, E’ at Tg + 30 K was selected for calculation of νe, which ensured that the copolymerized systems were in the
rubber state. The νe of each copolymerized system
is shown in Table 2.

Table 2 Tg + 30, E’ at Tg + 30, and νe values of PU-80 and PU-120
sample	Tg + 30 (K)	E’ at Tg + 30 (MPa)	νe (mol/m3)	
PU-80	328.25	1.83	223.52	
PU-120	325.73	2.06	253.56	
Table 2 shows the
νe’s of PU-80 and PU-120 of different cured
systems. From Table 2, PU-80 and PU-120 had nearly the same cross-linking density, and
the νe of PU-120 was slightly higher than that of
PU-80. In PU-120, higher cured temperature might be more helpful to
overcome the effect of steric hindrance in copolymerized system. Thus,
PU-120 had higher cross-linking density than PU-80.

3.4 Depolymerization of the Self-Healing Network
of Phenolic Polyurethanes
3.4.1 Dissolution of Phenolic Polyurethanes
Thermoset polymers with the dimensional network hardly dissolve
and only swell in organic solvents, even at high temperature. The
polyurethanes were put into trichlorobenzene at 25 °C and then
heated to 80, 100, or 110 °C to test the volume variation (Figure 10). The initial
volumes of PU-80 and PU-120 at 25 °C were both 1 cm2. After soaking at 80 and 100 °C for 5 h, both samples swelled
and the volumes were enlarged to 2.9 and 4 cm2 (PU-80)
and to 2.59 and 4 cm2 (PU-120), respectively. When at 100
°C, PU-80 and PU-120 were still insoluble, but after 5 h of immersion
at 110 °C, both samples were partially trichlorobenzene-soluble.
The underlying reason was that the polyurethane networks became unstable
and were partially destroyed by the temperature rise in the solvent.
After further soaking in the solvent at 120 °C, the samples were
nearly all dissolved, suggesting that the networks were fully destroyed
after the temperature rise. The dissolution tests confirm that the
covalent bonds were partially cut off from the network, so the network
dissolved at 120 °C.

Figure 10 Swelling of the polyurethane samples in trichlorobenzene
at 80,
100, and 110 °C for 5 h: (a–c) PU-80; (a1–c1) PU-120.

3.4.2 Temperature-Variable FTIR
The separation
and rebinding of the reversible urethane bonds and the decomposition
temperatures of PTHFTDI-ATOM were dynamically tracked by temperature-variable
FTIR, which clarified the variation of covalent bonds. The PTHFT-ATOM
was dissolved, bubble-removed, uniformly mixed, cast on the NaCl window,
and healed at 80 °C for 8 h. The samples were scanned from 25
to 190 °C and then cooled to 110 °C (Figure 11). The cleavage initial temperature (Tc) of phenolic urethane generally corresponds
to the peak of −NCO (2273 cm–1) that starts
to appear in the temperature-variable FTIR spectra. Herein, the peak
of −NCO was not found from 25 to 90 °C but appeared above
100 °C. This result is highly consistent with the dissolution
tests. Moreover, the peak of −NCO was not strengthened at above
150 °C, implying the new balance in reversible reaction between
phenolic hydroxyl and −NCO. The peak of NCO vanished again
after cooling down to 110 °C in 0.5 h. The isocyanate and phenolic
hydroxyl groups bonded again in this slow cooling process, which facilitated
the reversible polyurethane connection.

Figure 11 Temperature-variable
FTIR spectroscopy of the PU-80.

3.5 Self-Healing Behavior of Phenolic Polyurethanes
Considering the self-repairing ability, we aimed to test the possibility
of mechanical recovery after failure and self-curing. The self-repair
is essentially ascribed to the “separation and reconnection”
between the phenolic hydroxyl and NCO groups. The dissolution tests
and temperature-variable FTIR both suggest that the occurring temperature
of the reversible reaction between phenolic hydroxyl and isocyanate
is about 100–110 °C. Thus, we set the self-healing temperature
at 110 °C. A dumbbell-like sample was scissored in the middle,
and the two cut surfaces were immediately put tightly with no pressure
applied (Figure 12). After heating to 110 °C in a convection oven, the two pieces
self-healed after 10 h. The two pieces resisted severe deformation
despite a crack scare (Figure 12).

Figure 12 Self-healing behavior of the PU-80 (PTHFT-ATOM): (a) PU-80
was
cut in half; (b) it self-healed after heating; (c) it was stretched.

The self-curing behaviors of PU-80 and PU-120 were
compared via
tensile analysis. Self-curing ability is defined as the ratio of tensile
properties before and after the curing (Table 3). The tensile strength and elongation at
break of PU-80 decreased from 1.46 to 0.68 MPa and from 1093.50 to
963.89% after healing, respectively, indicating that the self-cured
PU-80 maintained about 46.57 and 88.15% of the initial tensile properties,
respectively. In comparison, the self-healed PU-120 maintained about
64.20 and 81.25% of the initial tensile properties, respectively.
Our previous work used the same prepolymer (abbreviated to PTHFT or
PTHFTDI) with an NCO content of 6.2%, which compounded from polytetrahydrofuran
and toluene diisocyanate. Propyl gallate, catechol, and tert-butylhydroquinone were chosen for preparation of three phenolic
polyurethanes.27 According to the tensile property analysis,
it could be learned that the self-healing abilities of the initial
elongation at break of these three kinds of polyurethanes were in
the following order: PTHFTDI-propyl gallate (93.67%) > PTHFTDI-urushiol
(72.01%) > PTHFTDI-catechol (68.63%).27 This study presents another bio-friendly substance with a phenolic
hydroxyl group and long-chain structure, which offers high compatibility
and thermal self-healing ability to phenolic polyurethanes. The temperature-variable
FTIR suggests the partial dissociation of phenolic urethane. Thus,
when the cracked surfaces of the broken samples were interlinked,
the destroyed tensile properties cannot be completely repaired. When
the cracked surfaces were put in air, the isocyanate reacted with
atmospheric water to form covalent urea bonds, which were irreversible
under the tested conditions. Thus, the cracked surfaces can be passivated
by water, so the self-healing ability of the broken samples was weakened.
However, the healed samples were efficiently cured and recovered the
mechanical properties to the original levels.

4 Conclusions
The adduct of tung oil
and 4-maleimidophenol (ATOM) was successfully
prepared from the Diels–Alder reaction of tung oil. Self-curing
thermoset polyurethanes were synthesized from ATOM and the polyurethane
prepolymer. The polymerization of the self-healing network was tested
via FTIR, temperature-variable FTIR, TGA, and DMA. Specifically, reversible
urethane bonds were formed from phenol hydroxyls and isocyanates that
can separate under heating and rebind upon cooling. These urethane
bonds contributed to the self-repair of the thermoset polyurethane
network via temperature regulation. The products were elastomers and
did not dissolve in organics below 110 °C. The self-healing thermosets
achieved about 81–88% and 46–64% of the initial elongation
at break and tensile strength, respectively, and thus are applicable
to self-curing coatings or adhesives.
