A metal–organic framework
[MIL-101(Cr)] was used as an efficient
heterogeneous catalyst in the synthesis of benzoazoles (benzimidazole,
benzothiazole, and benzoxazole), and quantitative conversion of products
were obtained under optimized reaction conditions. The catalyst could
be simply extracted from the reaction mixture, providing an efficient
and clean synthetic methodology for the synthesis of benzoazoles.
The MIL-101(Cr) catalyst could be reused without a remarkable decrease
in its catalytic efficiency.

Introduction
Benzoazoles
(benzimidazole, benzothiazole, and benzoxazole) are
unique motifs that exist in the structure of numerous biologically
important compounds, natural products, and advanced materials.1 The chemical structure of some of the biologically
active molecules containing benzoazole heterocycles are shown in Figure 1.2

Figure 1 Some drugs and biologically active compounds containing benzoazole
rings. Nexium (A) is a drug used to treat symptoms of gastroesophageal
reflux disease. (B) is used as fatty acid amide hydrolase inhibitor.
(C) Showed Ras-PDE delta inhibitor activity. (D) has a DNA-binding
property. (E) is used as a potent and selective 5-HT1A serotonin receptor
ligand. (F) is introduced as inhibitors of phosphoinositide 3-kinase
(PI 3-kinase) delta for the treatment of inflammatory diseases and
leukocyte malignancies.

In this regard, remarkable efforts have been made to discover
novel
and well-organized methodologies to prepare these compounds. The most
widely used strategy for the synthesis of benzoazoles is condensation
reaction of 2-aminophenols/2-aminothiophenol/o-phenylenediamine
with aldehydes and carboxylic acid derivatives. For this reaction,
different catalyst systems have been developed; however, most of them
often suffer from key limitations including low yields, harsh reaction
conditions, nonreusability of the catalyst, complicated workup process,
unclean synthesis, and limited substrates scope.3

In recent years, incredible growth has been attained
in the development
of metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) as flexible rational designing
materials and readily synthetic catalysts for chemical synthesis.4 These materials combine the benefits of clean
synthesis with heterogeneous catalysis, which really make simpler
workup process and is predominantly attractive from industrial point
of view. MOFs are mainly used as supports (catalyst platform) due
to their high pore volume, large surface areas, and flexible framework.5 Their use in organic synthesis as catalyst is
very important and different organic transformations including, Knoevenagel
and Aldol condensations, Michael addition, Henry and cycloaddition
reactions, and one-pot cascade reaction have been catalyzed with MOFs.6

One of the most attractive MOFs is MIL-101(Cr),
which was first
synthesized by Férey and co-workers. This material has the
framework of augmented mobil thirty-nine zeotype building, which consisted
of Cr(III)-trimmers cross-linked by 1,4-benzene dicarboxylate. There
are two types of mesopore cages with free diameters of 2.9 and 3.4
nm in the structure of this MOF. These cages are available via two
micropore windows of 1.2 and 1.6 nm, respectively. The large surface
area, high thermal, chemical, and solvent stability and numerous coordinative
unsaturated metal sites make MIL-101(Cr) an interesting material in
catalysis.7

As part of our interest
in heterogeneous catalysis,8 we report
herein the first example of benzoazole synthesis
catalyzed by MIL-101(Cr), developing the unique catalytic capability
of MOFs in organic synthesis to produce valuable benzoazoles in high
yields. This protocol represents the first utilization of MIL-101(Cr)
to promote condensation reaction of 2-aminophenols/2-aminothiophenol/o-phenylenediamine with aldehydes, utilizing only catalytic
sites exist on the MIL-101(Cr) structure. Our methodology may open
up our hand in the industrial synthesis of benzoazoles using MOFs
as environmentally friendly and readily available materials. The mild
reaction conditions, wide substrate scope, clean synthesis, and good
functional group tolerance are main characteristics of this new methodology.
We recently developed new catalysts for the synthesis of benzoazoles.9 Aware of the importance of benzoazoles and excellent
catalytic capability of MOFs, we studied whether MOF can be used as
an efficient catalyst to promote the condensation of aldehydes with
2-aminophenols/2-aminothiophenol/o-phenylenediamine.

Results
and Discussion
We set out our study by screening a range
of conditions for the
condensation of benzaldehyde with o-phenylenediamine
in the presence of various MOFs (Table 1).

a Reaction conditions: 1a (1 mmol), 2a (1.1
mmol), and solvent (5 mL).

b Isolated yields.

First,
the reaction between benzaldehyde and o-phenylenediamine
was checked in the presence of different MOFs as
catalyst and maximum yield of the product was obtained with MIL-101(Cr)
at room temperature (rt) (Table 1, entries 1–4). As shown in Table 1, in the absence of MOF as catalyst,
only 5% of the product was observed (entry 5), demonstrating that
MOFs have a key catalytic role in this reaction. By increasing the
reaction temperature, the yield was enhanced and optimum temperature
for high yield of product (3a) was selected as 55 °C
(Table 1, entries 6–8).
Then, the optimization of catalyst loading was done, and it seems
that 10 mg of MIL-101(Cr) is enough to obtain satisfactory yield (Table 1, entries 9–11).
Other reaction media were tested and EtOH was selected as superior
solvent for this reaction (Table 1, entries 12–16). Results demonstrate that entry
10 of Table 1 is the
best condition optimized for the synthesis of benzimidazole derivatives
using MIL-101(Cr) as catalyst.

Using the optimized reaction
conditions, we synthesized 2-phenylbenzothiazole
and obtained the maximum yield of 87% at a little higher temperature
of 60 °C. However, synthesis of benzoxazole derivatives needs
a high temperature of 120 °C and the best solvent tested to obtain
this product was xylene. Overall, the optimized reaction conditions
for the synthesis of benzoazoles using MIL-101(Cr) as catalyst are
shown in Scheme 1.

Scheme 1 Optimized Reaction Conditions for the Synthesis of Benzoazoles Using
MIL-101(Cr) as Catalyst
Before we start to investigate the generality and scope
of this
new synthetic methodology, some microscopic and spectroscopic analysis
from the synthesized MIL-101(Cr) catalyst are presented. Scanning
electron microscopy (SEM) images of the synthetic pristine MIL-101(Cr)
is shown in Figure 2. According to the SEM images, the MIL-101(Cr) crystals are formed
in the form of discrete octahedron with a smooth surface and have
an approximate average of 400 nm.

Figure 2 SEM images of synthesized MIL-101(Cr).

The Fourier transform infrared
(FT-IR) spectrum of our synthesized
MIL-101(Cr) corresponds well with that reported in the literature,
also confirming the formation of MIL-101(Cr) (Figure 3). For example, according to the FT-IR of
MIL-101(Cr), the band at 1392 cm–1 was related to
the symmetric (O–C–O) vibrations, implying the existence
of dicarboxylate group in the structure of MIL-101(Cr).10 The energy-dispersive X-ray spectra of the synthesized
MIL-101(Cr) exposed that the MOFs are composed of C, O, Cr, F, and
N (Supporting Information Figure S1). The
relative content of Cr in the synthetic MOF was determined to be about
0.35 mmol g–1 of MIL-101(Cr). The amount of Cr is
approximately in agreement with the inductively coupled plasma (ICP)
analysis results, suggesting that content of Cr as a catalytic site
is about 0.36 mmol g–1. The low-angle powder X-ray
diffraction (XRD) pattern of the prepared materials matches well with
that of the pristine reported MIL-101(Cr) in the literature (Figure 4).10 The nitrogen adsorption isotherm MIL-101(Cr) is depicted
in Figure 5. For the
prepared MIL-101(Cr), the specific surface area is calculated by the
Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) and the Langmuir methods,
which are about 2606 and 2816 m2 g–1,
respectively. The total pore volume and mean pore diameter of the
prepared MIL-101(Cr) is estimated to be 1.80 cm3 g–1 and 2.77 nm, respectively.

and reused (b) MIL-101(Cr).

Then, different derivatives of benzoxazoles, benzimidazoles,
and
benzothiazoles were synthesized using MIL-101(Cr) catalyst under optimized
conditions (Table 2).

As shown in Table 2, different benzoazole
derivatives were synthesized using the reaction
of 2-aminophenols/2-aminothiophenol/o-phenylenediamine
and substituted aldehydes using MIL-101(Cr) as catalyst in high isolated
yields and good turnover number (TON). The results indicate that the
yield depends to some extent on the electronic nature of the substituent
and as well its position in aromatic ring of aldehydes. Overall, aromatic
aldehydes having different substituents such as methoxy, nitro, chloro,
methyl, etc. tolerated the reaction to afford the corresponding benzoazole
derivatives in good to excellent yields. The time of reactions is
dependent on the position of the substituents on aldehyde, and more
time is needed to obtain high yields of ortho-functionalized aldehydes.
High yield of para-substituted aldehydes was obtained after 2–4
h. More reaction time is needed for the synthesis of benzoxazoles,
and this is related to the difficulty in the formation of this heterocycle.

With the aim to prove the synthetic usefulness of MIL-101(Cr) as
a catalyst in organic synthesis, we tried to synthesize a novel class
of bis-heterocyclic compounds containing benzoazole fragments. Bis-heterocycles
are molecules having two linked, fused, or bound heterocyclic compounds.11 This class of molecules has attracted much considerations
because of their several applications in different fields including
organic synthesis, agrochemistry, materials, optics, polymer sciences,
and medicinal chemistry.12 The main reason
for the synthesis and investigation of bis-heterocycles is that each
used heterocycle has its own activity and in combination with other
molecule may have synergetic effect and also create new properties.
Thus, two heterocycles that are suitably connected together (directly
or via a spacer) to form a complex molecule have high potential to
show a new property.13

Diverse bis-heterocyclic
compounds containing benzoazole fragments
were synthesized using MIL-101(Cr) as catalyst under our optimized
conditions. The aldehydes for the synthesis of these compounds were
prepared according to the synthetic method shown in Schemes 2 and 3.14 First, compounds 6a–e as bromo-substituted aldehyde were
synthesized using the reaction of isovanillin or 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde
(4a and 4b) and 1,n-dialkyl
bromides (5a–d).

Bromo-Substituted Aldehyde
Scheme 3 Synthesis of Diverse Aldehydes Containing a Heterocycle Moiety
After the synthesis of bromo-substituted
aldehyde, they were reacted
with selected heterocycles to synthesize new aldehydes containing
a heterocycle moiety, which is connected through a carbon chain spacer
(7a–g) (Scheme 3).

The synthesized bis-heterocyclic
compounds containing benzoazole
moieties from the synthetic aldehydes using MIL-101(Cr) catalyst under
optimized conditions are shown in Scheme 4.

Compounds 8a–e were synthesized
using the reaction of a theophylline-based aldehyde and one of the
2-aminophenols/2-aminothiophenol/o-phenylenediamine
coupling partner. These compounds containing a benzoazole ring and
also a theophylline heterocycle, both of which are important in medicinal
applications.15 Compounds 8f–h contain an adenine moiety, which it connected
to spacer using the sulfur group in 6-position of the adenine ring.16 In fact, 6-thio adenine (9H-purine-6-thiol) was used as the starting material for the synthesis
of these compounds according to the reaction pathway designed in this
study. When 6-thio adenine was reacted with bromo-substituted aldehyde 6 (Scheme 3), it underwent reaction by SH group and connected to the aldehyde
backbone via the C–S bond. Also, adenine (9H-purin-6-amine) was used to connect aldehyde backbone through the
C–N bond from the 9-position of the purin ring.17 Compounds 8i and 8j were synthesized using the reaction of o-phenylenediamine
and 2-aminophenol and aldehyde 7f, respectively.

Synthesis of bis-heterocycles containing two benzoazole moieties
is important from the viewpoint of medicinal and photophysical applications,
as they have interesting properties.2 Compounds 8k and 8l are benzimidazole–benzoxazole
and benzimidazole–benzothiazole bis-heterocycles, respectively,
which were synthesized efficiently using this synthetic methodology.
These compounds were prepared using the reaction of a benzimidazole-based
aldehyde 7g and 2-aminophenol/2-aminothiophenol under
optimized conditions.

Overall, this synthetic methodology is
suitable for the synthesis
of diverse benzoazole derivatives under mild and heterogeneous conditions.
Considering the chemical structure of MIL-101(Cr), it is possible
to propose a reaction mechanism for the production of benzoazoles
over the catalyst (Scheme 5). In the structure of MIL-101(Cr), there are Lewis acidic
sites (I) that, originating from Cr(III) and coordination of aldehyde
to these catalytic sites (II), can activate it to undergo reaction
with amino group and form an imine intermediate (III). The intramolecular
nucleophilic addition of the XH group (OH, SH, NH2) afforded
a heterocycle intermediate (IV) with a high potential to afford benzoazole
product in the presence of MIL-101(Cr).7b

Scheme 5 Proposed Mechanism for the Preparation of Benzoazoles in the Presence
of MIL-101(Cr) Catalyst
The reusability of the catalyst was also checked in the
reaction
of benzaldehyde and 2-aminothiophenol. The MIL-101(Cr) catalyst could
be reused at least five times with almost consistent efficiency (Table 3).

Some studies demonstrated
the heterogeneity of MIL-101(Cr) as a
catalyst in the synthesis of benzoazoles. The reused catalyst from
the reaction mixture was characterized and the results show that the
structure of MIL-101(Cr) after using in the reaction not alter considerably.
For example, after five cycles of reusability, the evaluation of the
Cr content of MIL-101(Cr) catalyst using ICP analysis demonstrated
that about 5.5% of Cr was removed from the catalyst. Also, the hot
filtration test done after the completion of the reaction between
benzaldehyde and 2-aminothiophenol showed that only 2.0% of Cr was
lost. The FT-IR spectrum of the catalyst after reuse also confirms
that the functional group of the catalyst did not change remarkably
(Figure 3). Also, the
XRD pattern of the catalyst after reuse is same as that of the fresh
one (Figure 4). In
addition, for the reused MIL-101(Cr), the specific surface area calculated
by the BET method was about 2572.8 m2 g–1 (compared to 2606 m2 g–1 for the fresh
one). The total pore volume and the mean pore diameter of the reused
MIL-101(Cr) were 1.77 cm3 g–1 and 2.75
nm, which are approximately same as those of the fresh one (Figure 5).

A comparison
between the catalytic activities of MIL-101(Cr) and
other reported catalyst systems in the synthesis of benzoazoles was
done, and the results are given in Table 4. As demonstrated in Table 4, the MIL-101(Cr) catalyst shows comparable
catalytic activity with other previously reported catalyst systems,
and in many cases, its shows superior activity under mild and more
sustainable reaction conditions.

Conclusions
In conclusion, MIL-101(Cr) was reported
as an efficient catalyst
system for the practical synthesis of benzoazole. The reaction conditions
for the synthesis of benzimidazoles and benzothiazoles is mild and
a range of derivatives were synthesized in ethanol as a green solvent
at normal temperature. For the synthesis of benzoxazoles, higher temperature
is needed, and the best solvent is xylene. This synthetic methodology
is also useful for the synthesis of complex molecules and a range
of bis-heterocyclic compounds containing benzoazole moiety were synthesized
using MIL-101(Cr) as catalyst. The catalyst can be reused several
times, and can be separated from the reaction mixture by simple filtration.
After removing the catalyst, the products were obtained in almost
pure form. Moreover, there is no remarkable loss in the catalytic
activity of MIL-101(Cr) after five cycles of reuse in the synthesis
of benzoazoles.

Experimental Section
General
All of
the starting materials and solvents
were supplied from Merck, Acros, and Sigma-Aldrich chemical companies.
The chemicals and solvents were used in this study without further
purification. To record the 1H NMR and 13C NMR
spectra, a Brucker (250 MHz) Avance DRX was used. Pure deuterated
DMSO-d6 and CDCl3 were used
as solvents and tetramethylsilane as an internal standard. Chemical
shifts were reported in ppm (δ) and coupling constants in Hz
(J). To characterize the catalyst and also synthetic compounds with
FT-IR spectroscopy, a Shimadzu FT-IR 8300 spectrophotometer was employed.
The scanning electron micrograph (SEM) for the catalyst was obtained
using XL-30 FEG SEM, Philips, at 20 kV. Inductively coupled plasma
(ICP) analysis was carried out using an analyzer (Varian, Vista-Pro).
The melting points were determined in open capillary tubes in a Buchi
melting point B-545. The progress of the reactions was monitored by
thin layer chromatography (TLC) on silica gel PolyGram SILG/UV254
plates. Also, to purify synthetic compounds, column chromatography
was employed using columns charged with silica gel 60 (70–230
mesh) mesh.

Procedure for the Synthesis of MIL-101(Cr)
A 75 mL
capacity Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave was charged with a
mixture of 5.4 g of Cr (NO3)3·9H2O, 1.5 g of terephthalic acid, 45 mL of deionized water, and 0.6
mL of hydrofluoric acid (5 mol L–1). The mixture
was sonicated for 10 min and then heated in an oven at 220 °C
for 8 h.34 Subsequently, the autoclave
was cool down to room temperature and the reaction mixture was filtered
and washed with distilled water. The obtained solid was dried in an
oven at 80 °C overnight. In this stage, the crude product is
a green powder, which contained both formed MIL-101(Cr) and white
sharp needle-type crystals as unreacted terephthalic acid. So, the
unreacted terephthalic acid should be removed in two steps. First,
the crude product was refluxed at 130 °C for 12 h in DMF solvent
and hot filtration was carried out. Also, in this stage, the solid
was washed with hot DMF 3 times (3 × 25 mL) and dried in an oven.
The first step should be repeated another two times and the product
dried at 70 °C for 12 h. In the second step, the resulting green
powder from the previous step was refluxed overnight in 50 mL ethanol
and hot filtration was done. Finally, the material was heated at 80
°C in an oven for 12 h to complete the activation.

General Procedure
for the Synthesis of Benzoazole Derivatives
Using the MIL-101(Cr) Catalyst
A canonical flask was charged
with ortho-phenylenediamine/o-aminophenol/o-aminothiophenol (1.0 mmol), aryl aldehyde (1.1 mmol),
solvent (EtOH or xylene; 5 mL), and MIL-101 (0.01 g). The reaction
mixture was stirred at specified temperature (55, 60, or 120 °C)
for the appropriate time shown in Table 2 and Scheme 4. To monitor the progress of the reaction, TLC with
suitable n-hexane/EtOAc eluent was used. After the
reaction was complete, the mixture was filtered, the catalyst washed
with ethyl acetate, and the organic solvent evaporated to obtain a
concentrated crude product, which was purified using column chromatography
on silica gel (eluent of petroleum ether and EtOAc) to give pure products 3a–r and 8a–l.

Recovery of the Catalyst
Reusability of the MIL-101(Cr)
catalyst was investigated by the reaction of benzaldehyde with 2-aminothiophenol.
Upon completion of the reaction, the MIL-101(Cr) catalyst was separated
from the reaction mixture using filtration. The catalyst was then
washed with hot ethanol (3 × 5 mL) and then by hot water (3 ×
5 mL). After drying under vacuum at 80 °C for 6h, the catalyst
could be reused directly without further purification in the next
run. The catalyst could be recycled for five runs without the obvious
loss of activity (Table 3).

General Procedure for the Synthesis of Aldehydes 6a–d
To synthesize aldehydes 6a–d, p-hydroxybenzaldehyde (0.02
mol, 2.44 g), K2CO3 (2.76 g, 0.02 mol), dibromoalkane
(0.06 mol), and a catalytic amount of tetra-n-butylammonium
bromide (TBAB, 0.1 g) were refluxed in MeCN (50 mL) for 20 h. The
progress of the reaction was monitored with TLC; after the completion
of the reaction, the reaction temperature was reduced to room temperature
and the solvent evaporated. The crude product as a foam was dissolved
in CHCl3, (150 mL) and washed with water (3 × 150
mL). Then, the organic layer was dried over anhydrous Na2SO4 and evaporated. To obtain pure product, column chromatography
on silica gel [eluting with a mixture of n-hexane
and EtOAc (10:1)] was used.

General Procedure for the Synthesis of Theophylline
and Benzimidazole
and Adenine-Based Aldehyde 7a–g
A 100 mL double-necked round-bottom flask equipped with a condenser
was charged with K2CO3 (1.38 g, 0.01 mol), nuclobase
(0.01 mol), aldehydes 6a–d (0.012
mol), a catalytic amount of TBAB (0.1 g), and MeCN solvent (50 mL).
The reaction mixture was heated for 20 h at reflux temperature of
acetonitrile. The solvent was evaporated when the reaction was accomplished
(monitored by TLC), and the reaction temperature reduced to room temperature.
The crude product was dissolved in CHCl3 (150 mL) and then
washed with water (3 × 100 mL). Then, the organic solvent was
dried over anhydrous Na2SO4 and evaporated.
The crude product was purified by column chromatography on silica
gel [eluting with a mixture of n-hexane and EtOAc
(1:1)].
