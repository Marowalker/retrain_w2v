Graphene
oxide (GO), as a two-dimensional structure material, has
attracted widespread attention in the field of molecule sieving. However,
GO-based membranes usually exhibit undesirable separation performance
because the microstructure of GO is difficult to adjust. Herein, a
novel double-crosslinking strategy for tuning the interlayer spacing
of GO is reported. The hybrid membrane fabricated by the double-crosslinking
strategy was used for pervaporation (PV) dehydration of isopropanol.
To achieve high-performance of the PV hybrid membranes, the effects
of operating cycles, chitosan concentration, and GO concentration
were systematically investigated. The PV hybrid membranes were characterized
by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy,
water contact angle measurement, and scanning electron microscopy.
The results demonstrate that the interlayer of GO can be adjusted
successfully by the double-crosslinking strategy. The fabricated hybrid
membrane containing 0.1 wt % GO exhibited excellent performance with
a flux of 4391 g/m2h and a separation factor of 1491, which
indicated that the double-crosslinking strategy may extend the applications
of GO in the field of membrane separation.

1 Introduction
Pervaporation
possesses great potential to separate liquids, especially
for azeotropic and close boiling point mixtures. Isopropanol (IPA),
as a basic chemical raw material and solvent, is widely applied in
the pharmaceutical and chemical industries.1,2 To
obtain high-purity IPA, many traditional technologies such as extractive
distillation, molecular sieve absorption, and azeotrope distillation
as well as pervaparation have been studied.3 Among them, pervaporation gets a great deal of attention due to
its advantages of easy operation, energy saving, high efficiency,
and environment friendly.4−7 The critical link for the full utilization of pervaporation
is the development of pervaporation membranes.8,9

Graphene oxide (GO) is a two-dimensional material derived from
graphite. Owing to its defined channel dimensions, excellent transport
capabilities and outstanding molecular sieving properties,10,11 GO has shown great potential for water desalination,12,13 electrochemical energy storage,14,15 gas separation,16 and bioseparation17 and biofouling control.18

To further
extend its application in the field of membranes, great
efforts have been focused on tuning the interlayer spacing of GO by
physical approaches (e.g., intercalating with other nanomaterials19 and introducing membrane porosity20,21) and chemical strategies (adding cations in the membrane matrix22,23). For instance, improved water permeation was achieved for composite
GO-framework membranes by the incorporation of GO in the poly(vinyl
alcohol) solution.24 Templating the GO
framework with copper hydroxide nanostrands and their subsequent removal
by ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid resulted in an enhanced porous
structure that led to a 10-fold enhancement in flux.25 For chemical modification of GO, researchers often take
advantages of the abundant active oxygen-containing functional groups26−28 on GO to adjust the interlayer spacing. Chen et al.11 demonstrated that intercalation of cations in GO can effectively
control the interlayer spacing and thus efficiently improve the performance
of GO membranes. Based on these recent achievements, the application
of GO materials possesses great potential in the membrane field.29

In this study, a novel double-crosslinking
strategy was reported
for tuning the interlayer spacing of GO to further improve the pervaporation
performance of a GO-based membrane. First, chitosan (CS) was used
as a binder of GO nanosheets owing to the presence of hydrogen bonds
and electrostatic interactions between them. Then, a secondary crosslinking
between CS and GO was conducted using trimesoyl chloride (TMC) as
a crosslinking agent. The GO membranes fabricated by the double-crosslinking
strategy were characterized by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy
and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analyses; besides, its
physiochemical properties were compared with its single-crosslinked
counterpart. The results of FTIR and XPS indicated the increase of
hydrogen bonds and presence of electrostatic interactions in the membrane
matrix. The fabricated hybrid membranes exhibited excellent separation
performance (pervaporation separation index (PSI) value of 8.5 ×
106) for isopropanol (IPA) dehydration, which underpinned
its great potential for the novel double-crosslinking approach.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Characterization of GO-Based
Crosslinking
Membranes
To investigate the chemical properties (e.g., crosslinking)
of GO membranes, different membranes including the pure CS membrane,
CS–GO single-crosslinked membrane, and CS–GO/TMC double-crosslinked
membrane were fabricated on Al2O3 ceramic supports
and characterized by FTIR as in Figure 1. The FTIR absorption peaks of several major groups
are summarized in Table S1.30 Compared with pure CS membranes, the peak positions
of the CS–GO single-crosslinked membranes present red shift
phenomena. Furthermore, the peak positions of C=O and N–H
groups of double-crosslinked CS–GO/TMC membranes present a
more obvious red shift phenomenon (Figure 1). Moreover, the area ratios of C=O
and N–H groups on crosslinked membranes are less than 1 (Table S1). These observations can be explained
by the electrostatic interaction between the carboxyl (−COOH)
on the GO and the amidogen (−NH2) on the CS (see Figure 3a),31 successfully crosslinking between the acyl chloride groups
(O=C–Cl) and −NH2 on the CS32,33 (Figure S1). In addition, the absorption
band of −OH broadens, indicating an increase of the number
of hydrogen bonds in the membrane matrix.34,35

Figure 1 FTIR
spectra of CS, CS–GO, and CS–GO/TMC membranes.
The CS, GO, and TMC concentrations of the crosslinking membranes were
1.0, 0.1, and 0.5 wt %, respectively.

Figure 2 and Table 1 present the chemical
compositions36,37 and chemical bond content of
various membranes, respectively, through XPS analysis. High-resolution
XPS analysis of the C 1s peak shows that the peak area percentage
of the N–C=O bond decreases from 17.1% for CS to 15.8%
for CS–GO. Similarly, that of the C–N bond reduces from
20.7 to 16.7%. This result could be partially explained by the interaction
between the amidogen (−NH2) on the CS with the carboxyl
(−COOH) on the GO (see Figure 3a) in addition to
the dilution effect by blending CS with GO. Furthermore, the content
of C–O/C–OH bonds increases from 18.8 to 24.9% and the
carbon atom content increases from 35.8 to 54.9% because of the successful
incorporation of GO in the CS solution. The XPS wide-scan in Figure 2b shows 4.0% of the
Al 2p signal that originated from the Al2O3 ceramic
support. This indicates that the CS–GO membrane has significant
defects.

and (c) CS–GO/TMC membranes. The CS, GO, and TMC concentrations
of the hybrid membranes were 1.0, 0.1, and 0.5 wt %, respectively.

the hybrid membranes were 1.0 and 0.5 wt %, respectively

The XPS spectra of the CS–GO/TMC
membranes are shown in Figure 2c. The content of
C–O/C–OH bonds dramatically reduces from 24.9 to 5.0%
(Table 1), which is
consistent with the chemical crosslinking of CS–GO by TMC (e.g.,
the reaction between hydroxyls (−OH) on CS–GO and acryl
chloride groups (O=C–Cl) on TMC as shown in Figure 3b). In addition,
the Al 2p signal can no longer be detected for the CS–GO/TMC
membrane, indicating the formation of an intact separation layer on
the ceramic support.

Based on the results of XPS analysis, the
CS–GO single-crosslinking
membrane has some drawbacks due to the existence of the Al 2p signal.
Therefore, the water contact angles of the double-crosslinking membranes
were measured to highlight the effect of GO on membrane hydrophilicity
as compared with that of the CS/TMC single-crosslinking membrane.
The water contact angles of CS–GOY/TMC membranes are illustrated in Figure 4, where Y represents GO
concentration. The water contact angle at any given time followed
the order of: CS–GO0.2/TMC< CS–GO0.1/TMC < CS–GO0.3/TMC < CS/TMC. This
demonstrates that GO plays a dual role in the hydrophilicity of the
hybrid membranes. The water contact angle decreases with increased
GO concentration when GO concentration is less than 0.2 wt % on account
of the water channels provided by GO containing many hydrophilic functional
groups. However, the contact angle increases when GO concentration
is greater than 0.2 wt %, which is detrimental to the hydrophilicity
of hybrid membranes. A possible reason for this phenomenon is that
enhanced interactions24 between CS molecules
and GO sheets hamper the permeation of water.

Figure 4 Water contact angles
of CS/TMC, CS–GO0.1/TMC,
CS–GO0.2/TMC, and CS–GO0.3/TMC
membranes. The symbol (*) in the figure indicates perfect wetting
(contact angle ≈ 0°). The CS and TMC concentrations were
1.0 and 0.5 wt %, respectively.

The effect of GO concentration (Y) on the cross-section
and outside surface morphologies of the CS–GOY/TMC hybrid membranes is demonstrated in Figure 5. The particle-like texture
of the Al2O3 substrate is clearly presented
in the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images when no or 0.1 wt
% GO concentration was used (Figure 5b,d), which was consistent with the formation of relatively
thin rejection layers under these conditions (Figure 5a,c). As the GO concentration increases,
the texture of the substrate disappears gradually (Figure 5f,h) and the laminate membrane
structure of GO is clearly visible (Figure 5e,g). However, the rejection layers became
thicker.

CS–GO0.1/TMC, (e, f) CS–GO0.2/TMC,
and (g, h) CS–GO0.3/TMC membranes. The CS and TMC
concentrations were 1.0 and 0.5 wt %, respectively. The number of
operating cycles was 3.

The effect of CS concentration
(X) on the morphologies
of the CSX–GO/TMC hybrid membranes
is shown in Figure 6. The thickness of the rejection layer increases with the increase
of CS concentration, which is similar to the effect of increasing
GO concentration (Figure 5). At a CS concentration of 3.0 wt %, the membrane surface
appears to be smooth (Figure 6h), which can be explained by the increased viscosity of the
CS–GO mixture at higher CS concentrations (see Figure S2).

membranes. The GO and TMC concentrations were 0.2 and 0.5 wt %, respectively.
The number of operating cycles was 3.

The morphologies of the cross-section and surface of CS–GO/TMC/N
membranes are shown in Figure 7, where N represents the number of operating cycles of the
double-crosslinking membrane prepared on ceramic support. At a low
number of operating cycles (e.g., 1), there are obvious defects on
the surface of the CS–GO/TMC/1 hybrid membrane: the rough surface
of the ceramic support cannot even be entirely covered (Figure 7a,b). Increasing the number
of operating cycles (e.g., 2–4) results in the formation of
an intact rejection layer (Figure 7c–h). In addition, no apparent delamination
between the rejection layer and the support can be observed owing
to the presence of hydrogen bonds between the surface active layer
and ceramic support.

membranes. The CS, GO, and TMC concentrations were 1.0, 0.2, and 0.5
wt %, respectively.

2.2 Pervaporation
Dehydration Performance of Hybrid
Membranes
The pure CS and single-crosslinked CS–GO
membranes did not exhibit a separation effect for the water–IPA
mixture when the concentration of CS is low. Therefore, the double-crosslinked
GO-framework membranes were used to separate the water–IPA
mixtures via PV at 60 °C. Various factors for the separation
performance of the membranes were investigated, such as the GO concentration,
CS concentration, and number of operation cycles.

The PV performance
of the hybrid membranes with different GO concentrations is shown
in Figure 8. The separation
factor increases when the GO concentration increases from 0 to 0.3
wt %, while the flux first increases and then decreases. A possible
explanation is that GO plays a dominant role in providing passages
for water penetration at first. However, the function of GO is weakened
and the transmembrane resistance plays a great role with the increase
of membrane thickness (Figure 5). Besides the increased membrane thickness, another main
reason for increased separation factor is the formation of a more
laminate structure (Figure 5g) of GO with increased GO concentration. Such a laminate
structure is preferred for the transport of water molecules.38

Figure 8 PV performance of CS/TMC, CS–GO0.1/TMC,
CS–GO0.2/TMC, and CS–GO0.3/TMC
hybrid membranes.
The CS and TMC concentrations in the hybrid membranes were 1.0 and
0.5 wt %, respectively. The number of operating cycles was 3.

From Figure 9, the
flux of the hybrid membranes decreases gradually while the separation
factor increases with the increase of CS concentration, which demonstrates
that CS concentration plays an important role in the pervaporation
performance of the hybrid membranes. The higher the CS concentration
is, the thicker the membrane becomes, resulting in the increase of
transmembrane resistance of the hybrid membranes.28 However, increased membrane thickness is of benefit to
form an intact separation layer, leading to an increased separation
factor.

Figure 9 PV performance of CS0.5–GO/TMC, CS1.0–GO/TMC, CS2.0–GO/TMC, and CS3.0–GO/TMC hybrid membranes. The GO and TMC concentrations in
the hybrid membranes were 0.2 and 0.5 wt %, respectively. The number
of operating cycles was 3.

The effect of the operating cycles on the PV performance of the
hybrid membranes is shown in Figure 10. The flux is 18.0 kg/m2h with a separation
factor of merely 5.5 when the number of operating cycles is only once,
which echoes the presence of some surface defects on the hybrid membrane
(Figure 7b). With the
increase of the number of operating cycles, the membrane flux decreases
slightly while the separation factor increases significantly. An intact
separation layer is required to ensure the excellent separation performance
of the hybrid membranes for IPA–water separation. As the membrane
thickness increased, an intact separation layer was generated on the
surface, guaranteeing the gradual increase of the separation factor,
the effect of which was similar to that of the increase in CS concentration.

Figure 10 PV performance
of CS–GO/TMC/1, CS–GO/TMC/2, CS–GO/TMC/3,
and CS–GO/TMC/4 hybrid membranes. The CS, GO, and TMC concentrations
in the hybrid membranes were 1.0, 0.2, and 0.5 wt %, respectively.

The long-term stability of the GO-based membrane
was investigated
by separating 90 wt % IPA aqueous solution at 60 °C. From Figure 11, both the membrane
flux and separation factor remain nearly unchanged during the operation
for 100 h, which illustrates that the hybrid membranes fabricated
by the double-crosslinking strategy exhibit good durability.

solution at 60 °C.

2.3 PV Performance

performances of the hybrid membranes in this work are compared with
those in the literature (Table 2). It is obvious that the double-crosslinking membranes in
this study exhibit excellent separation performances and great potential
in IPA dehydration.

3 Conclusions
A series of GO-framework membranes were successfully
fabricated
by the double-crosslinking strategy for PV dehydration of IPA. FTIR,
XPS, SEM, water contact angle and PV tests were used to investigate
the physicochemical properties, morphologies, hydrophilicity, and
separation performance of the obtained membranes. The FTIR and XPS
results reveal the formation of hydrogen bonds between GO and CS and
the successful crosslinking between CS–GO and TMC. The GO in
the membrane matrix provides selective water passages, which results
in an excellent membrane flux. The successful crosslinking between
CS–GO and TMC ensures excellent separation performance for
IPA dehydration. Therefore, the fabricated hybrid membranes provide
a useful reference to develop novel PV membranes and great potential
for the dehydration of alcohol.

4 Experimental
Section
4.1 Materials
Chitosan (CS, 50–100
mPa at 20 °C, the deacetylation degree > 80%) was obtained
from
Titan Scientific Co., Ltd. Shanghai, China. Acetic acid (HAc, AR,
≥99.5 wt %) and isopropanol (IPA, AR, ≥99.7 wt %) were
purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. Shanghai, China.
Trimesoyl chloride (TMC, ≥99.8 wt %) was received from Qingdao
Benzo Chemical Company, China. Ceramic supporting membranes with a
mean pore diameter of 0.9 μm,45 graphene
oxide,46 and deionized water were prepared
in our laboratory.

4.2 Fabrication of the CS–GO
Crosslinking
Solution
First, 0.5–3.0 wt % CS solutions were prepared
by dissolving certain mass of CS in 2.0 wt % HAc solution at room
temperature. After the CS was completely dissolved, the prepared GO
solution was added into the CS solution three times. During this process,
the CS–GO mixed solution was stirred and treated by ultrasound
to ensure the fabrication of the single-crosslinked GO framework.

4.3 Fabrication of CS–GO/TMC Hybrid Membranes
The ceramic hollow fiber membrane was selected as a support because
of its high selectivity, permeability, thermal stability, and mechanical
stability.47,48 A membrane testing module was
fabricated first, and the preparation procedures could be obtained
from previous papers.49,50 The fabricated membrane testing
modules were immersed in the CS–GO crosslinking solution for
4 min. The excess CS–GO solution on the outside surface of
the ceramic support was blown away by a circular air knife which ensured
the uniformity and unity of the mixed solution on the ceramic support.
Then, the membrane testing modules were immersed in TMC organic solution
for 4 min, and the second crosslinking reaction between CS–GO
and TMC occurred during the immersion time. The fabricated hybrid
membranes were placed in a 75 °C oven for 5 min to allow further
reaction. The above process was remarked as a cycle and repeated several
times for formation of dense nondefective membranes, which was shown
in Figure 12. The
prepared membranes are denoted CSX–GOY/TMC/N, where superscripts X and Y mean the mass concentration of CS and GO,
respectively, and N means the number of operating cycles.

Figure 12 Schematic
illustration of the preparation process of the CS–GO/TMC
hybrid membrane.

4.4 Characterization
The surface chemical
compositions of the crosslinking membranes were analyzed by Fourier
transform infrared (FTIR, Nicolet-6700) spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS, VG-Miclab II, U.K.). The hydrophilicity of hybrid
membranes was determined by a contact angle meter (JC2000A, Shanghai
Zhong Cheng Digital Equipment Co., Ltd, China) at room temperature.
Membrane morphologies containing cross-sections with a magnification
of 50 000 and surfaces with a magnification of 10 000
were observed by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM,
Nova NanoSEM 450).

4.5 PV Experiments
The PV performance
of the hybrid membranes was investigated in dehydrating a 90 wt %
IPA–H2O mixture at 60 °C. The PV experiment
was conducted by a self-made apparatus.49,51 The permeate
side of the hybrid membranes was maintained at a pressure of −0.1
MPa throughout the experiment. The composition of the permeate solution
was analyzed by gas chromatography (Techcomp GC7890T, China). The
membrane flux (J), separation factor (α), and
pervaporation separation index (PSI) were calculated by the following
formulas.52 1   2   3  where W is the total
weight
of permeate vapor (g), A is the effective membrane
area (m2), and t is the permeation time
(h), Yw/Ye is the mass percentages of water to ethanol in permeate, and Xw/Xe is that in
feed.
