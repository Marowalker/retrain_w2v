In this work, the structuring of
iron oxide nanoparticles via spray-drying (SD) of aqueous suspensions
is investigated, leading to micrometer-sized aggregates with saturation
magnetization comparable to that of the individual nanoparticles.
Interestingly, the superparamagnetic behavior is retained despite
the multicore structure. Modification of the aggregates via the addition
of silica nanoparticles to the suspension allows for control of the
resulting magnetization by adjusting the iron oxide content. Moreover,
the morphology of the produced aggregates is gradually shifted from
irregular inflated-like shapes in case of pure iron oxide aggregates
to reach spherical structures when bringing the silica content to
only 20%. The aggregates with different magnetization can be effectively
separated in a simple column with an attached permanent magnet. Functionalization
of pure iron oxide aggregates with a previously coupled ligand holding
a nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA)-like moiety and subsequent loading with
Ni2+ ions leads to the ability to bind 6-histidine (His6)-tagged target proteins via chelation complexes for magnetic
separation. The application of the presented system for the purification
of recombinant protein A in multiple cycles is shown. The recyclability
of the separation system in combination with the high degree of magnetic
separation is promising for future applications in the field of preparative
in situ protein purification.

==== Body
Introduction
Iron oxide nanoparticles
are widely utilized in multiple fields such as the mining industry,
biomedicine, and in applications for magnetic sealing using ferrofluids.1−5 They are established in various separation as well as purification
tasks in food processing, wastewater treatment, and biotechnological
production.3,6,7 In the size
range below about 20 nm, they contain a single domain and show superparamagnetism,8 which facilitates the handling in production
processes since there is no magnetic attraction without a present
external magnetic field. Based on the described characteristics, the
term superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) is widely
used. However, due to the small volume, the total magnetic moment
of each individual particle is small and thus may require high-gradient
magnetic separation systems for recovery.9,10 A
bigger particle size, which could circumvent this shortcoming by an
increased total magnetic moment, would in turn lead to a ferromagnetic
behavior, making the general handling more difficult due to possible
magnetic agglomeration. Therefore, magnetic nanoparticles are often
encased by a polymer matrix or nonmagnetic shell of, for example,
silica.11

The production of recombinant
proteins and peptides plays an important role within the global biotechnology
market with more than 400 marketed products.12 Thereby, downstream processing is responsible for up to 80% of the
costs due to the standard use of multiple steps including chromatography.13,14 To reduce these costs, it is desirable to establish separation and
purification strategies for continuous use. Various approaches using
the adsorption onto magnetic nanoparticles and their subsequent separation
have been reported.15−17 The magnetic separation can be improved by increasing
the magnetization of the individual particles, which is achieved by
combining multiple nanoparticles in a multicore particle with a bigger
size. Usually this is done by embedding SPIONs in a polymer matrix.18

A different possibility to create multicore
particles is the aggregation via spray-drying (SD) of nanoparticulate
suspensions.19 SD is generally a well-established
process with good reproducibility and scalability20 used in various industries where easier handling of particles
and increased safety is reached via the granulation of nanoparticles.21 The size of aggregates that can be realized
is limited to the lower micrometer range because of the combination
of the typically low mass content of the used suspensions and a small
droplet size that results from different parameters including the
nozzle diameter. By SD of colloidal suspensions, structures containing
multiple (iron oxide) cores can be prepared22 and the morphology of the produced aggregates can be controlled.21 However, while iron oxide nanoparticles have
been spray-dried in mixed materials,23−25 to the best of our knowledge,
we present for the first time a systematic study on the SD of SPIONs
and the resulting magnetic characteristics. Furthermore, spray-drying
of a bimodal nanoparticle population in one suspension leads to the
segregation of the particle classes during the drying process and
results in core–shell-like aggregates with the smaller particles
forming the shell and the bigger particle fraction being in the core
based on a segregation process.26−28 The formation of a shell of small
particles is only avoided when the drying time is drastically increased.28 Hence, by choosing an appropriate combination
of process parameters as well as feed particles in terms of material
characteristics and size, a tailored product can be prepared.

Our main goal in this study is to establish a tool for the targeted
preparation of hierarchical magnetic aggregates with the option to
tailor the magnetization and thus the magnetic separability of the
resulting product. Moreover, the particles are modified for the continuous
use in protein purification by providing a specific interaction and
binding of a target protein in combination with repeated magnetic
recovery and reusability. The material should offer a high specific
surface area to maintain a large number of adsorption sites. Therefore
iron oxide nanoparticles were synthesized via the nonaqueous sol–gel
route and structured in a spray-drying process of aqueous suspensions
to gain aggregates with increased magnetic recovery compared to nanoparticle
agglomerates. The particles were functionalized with a tailored ligand
for the specific interaction with the target product. The preparation
of the functionalized SD-SPIONs as well as the concept of the application
are schematically shown in Figure 1.

Figure 1 Schematic overview of (A) the spray-drying and functionalization
process and (B) the application of the functionalized aggregates in
protein purification.

The synthesis and structuring
are analyzed by various methods including X-ray diffraction (XRD),
thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), laser diffraction, scanning electron
microscopy (SEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR),
and magnetic analysis. Mixed aggregates with silica were analyzed
in terms of their magnetization with a superconducting quantum interference
device (SQUID), and the varied morphologies are demonstrated with
electron microscopy.

While our previous study17 was focused on the integration of the in situ purification
of proteins from microbial cultivation using agglomerated functionalized
nanoparticles, here we focus on the tailoring of the magnetic particles
to improve separability and retention over consecutive cycles.

Results
and Discussion
First, we characterized the structure and
crystallinity of the prepared particles. The material can be identified
as inverse spinel iron oxide from the powder X-ray diffractograms
after synthesis as well as after spray-drying (Figure 2). However, maghemite and magnetite can hardly
be distinguished due to the similarity of their respective crystal
structures and consequently the corresponding diffraction patterns.29,30 Detailed investigations have revealed that the iron oxide particles
under the used conditions typically form as mixed magnetite–maghemite
nanocrystals both in hydrophobic and hydrophilic organic reaction
media.31,32

Figure 2 X-ray diffractograms of the synthesized iron
oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs, top) and spray-dried aggregates (SD-SPIONs,
middle) with the reference pattern (bottom) of magnetite (ICSD-98-003-5000:
Fe3O4).

Applying the Scherrer equation, the crystallite size of the examined
samples can be calculated from the (311) reflection (2θ = 35.4°)
as the most pronounced signal. It is 6.5 nm for as-synthesized particles
and 6.6 nm for spray-dried particles, respectively. Interestingly,
the spray-drying process does not lead to an increase of the size
of the crystalline phases as indicated by the broad reflections.30 Hence, despite the formation of bonds between
the individual nanoparticles during the aggregation process, a significant
growth or ripening of the crystallites does not occur under the used
conditions, most likely due to organic residues on the surface of
the nanoparticles.

The particle size distribution of the obtained
aggregates is given in Figure 3. The median diameter is x50,3 = 7.0 μm. A slight increase of the particle size to 7.4 μm
is observed after functionalization with fused ligand of GLYMO and
L-NTA (GNTA), which can be attributed to the occurrence of larger
agglomerates that are possibly induced by interactions of the molecules
of the added organic layer on the surface. Treatment of the aggregates
with ultrasound does not lead to a change in the particle size. Consequently,
the mechanical stability is expected to be high enough to withstand
mechanical stresses that occur during biological applications such
as microbial cultivation or separation processes.

and with (green) GNTA-functionalization measured with laser diffraction
in an aqueous suspension.

The morphologies of pure iron oxide and mixed SD aggregates are depicted
in Figure 4. Pure iron
oxide aggregates show an irregular shape (Figure 4A) similar to doughnut-like or deflated structures
caused by the buckling of a shell formed during the drying process
that is influenced by cohesive and compressive forces in the drying
droplet.21,33 The addition of SiO2 to the nanoparticle
suspension results in a gradual change in the morphology (Figure 4B) and leads to spherical
aggregates with 20% SiO2 (Figure 4C) with an iron oxide shell around a silica
core based on the segregation of the bimodal particles.28 The shape does not change when the SiO2 content is increased further (Figure 4D). The reason for this behavior is thought to be the
different diffusion of particles during the drying of the droplets
in the SD process. The small iron oxide particles will form a shell
of the droplet with a thin, closely packed wall that remains stable
during most of the drying process and leads to the formation of a
hollow sphere that ultimately collapses, resulting in the buckling
of the aggregates similar to the observation described by Sen et al.34 The introduction of bigger silica particles
into the suspension changes the processes during the drying of the
droplet, with the iron oxide wall being thinner and the particles
able to reorganize while the droplet shrinks, thus leading to spherical
aggregates.23,33 Additionally, the surface of
the aggregates shows increasing roughness with a higher content of
the silica particles.

Figure 4 Scanning electron micrographs of aggregates: (A) SD-SPIONs;
SD-SiO2-SPION-XX with iron oxide contents of (B) 90%, (C)
80%, and (D) 40%, respectively. Scale bar is 2 μm in all images.

The mean diameters of aggregates with different
iron oxide mass contents are given in Figure S2. The particle size is between 6 and 8 μm for compositions
within the range of 20–80% FexOy. With further increasing mass content, the
size increases to around 15 μm for pure iron oxide aggregates.

Considering the previous observation, for aggregates with up to
80% iron oxide, there is a correlation between the spherical morphology
and the consistent size of about 7 μm, while with increasing
deviation from the spherical shape with a higher iron oxide content,
the measured diameter shows a rising trend. The void volume in the
deflated aggregates is not detected by light scattering and hence
the overall size of the aggregates is derived from the outer diameter,
which is bigger than that of a densely packed sphere.

Pure SD
FexOy has
a specific surface area of 114.36 m2 g–1 as determined by nitrogen adsorption. The surface area of the as-prepared
nanoparticles cannot be directly measured in a dry state. However,
assuming a particle size of 6.5 nm as obtained from XRD and a density
of 5.2 g m–3, the specific surface area can be calculated
to be 177.51 m2 g–1. Thus, the decrease
in the specific surface area during the spray-drying process is relatively
low, and a high porosity is present within the aggregates.

When
measuring magnetization versus the magnetic flux density, the synthesized
particles show no hysteresis loops, having neither remanence nor a
coercive field, which is typical for superparamagnetic materials and
is known for iron oxide particles below a diameter of 20 nm (Figure 5).8 Interestingly, the spray-dried aggregates with a particle
size of 7.0 μm exhibit analogous superparamagnetic characteristics
while showing a slightly increased saturation magnetization at 5 T.
Hence, the nanoparticles magnetically still behave like individual
particles while there might be a positive interaction of the magnetic
moments. The specific magnetization of the aggregates can be changed
when the iron oxide nanoparticles are partially substituted by silica
nanoparticles. The magnetization behavior without a hysteresis can
still be observed, indicating that the iron oxide nanoparticles are
not influenced in their magnetic characteristics.

Figure 5 Magnetization curves
of the synthesized iron oxide nanoparticles (black) and pure (red)
as well as mixed (cyan) SD aggregates.

The magnetization at 5 T of primary iron oxide nanoparticles as well
as SD aggregates with various compositions is shown in Figure 6, with schematic illustrations
of the morphology and the predicted internal aggregate structure.
It can be clearly seen that there is not a linear but a sigmoidal
dependency between the relative iron oxide mass content and the resulting
magnetization M5T of the aggregates. A possible explanation
is an increased interaction between the magnetic dipoles in the iron
oxide nanoparticles within the thicker iron oxide shells that are
formed with the increasing iron oxide mass content because of the
particle segregation during the SD process. The observed enhancing
effect of the magnetic properties of closely packed iron oxide nanoparticles
has been reported in the literature based on increased magnetic interactions.35,36

Figure 6 Magnetization

of iron oxide. Drawings show the schematic aggregate structure consisting
of SPIONs (dark gray) and silica nanoparticles (light gray).

A possible application of the spray-dried aggregates
is in protein purification using in situ affinity chromatography and
magnetic separation.37 After successful
separation, the adsorbed protein can be eluted from the particles
and polished as a biotechnological product. To realize the selective
binding of the particles with the target protein, the surface of the
aggregates needs to be decorated with moieties allowing for a specific
interaction. Here, the approach is to use NTA groups, which form complexation
bonds with His6-tagged proteins and can be fused onto the
particle surface with an appropriate functionalizing ligand that has
been described previously.38,39

Iron oxide nanoparticles
were analogously coupled to GNTA both directly after synthesis as
well as after spray-drying to compare the success of functionalization.
The amount of attached ligand was then analyzed by means of the mass
added to the solid matter. Figure 7 presents a comparison of the relative mass during
the heating of as-synthesized iron oxide particles and functionalized
particles with and without structuring. All materials show a mass
loss up to about 150 °C, which can be attributed to the absorbed
water. With further heating, organic compounds are desorbed from the
particle surface. These can be both solvents from the synthesis that
could not be washed off as evidenced for the primary particles (up
to 300 °C) and adsorbed ligands (up to 450 °C) as seen in
the functionalized particles, proving the success of this step. The
distinct reduction in the total relative mass loss of the functionalized
SD aggregates of about 10% in comparison to both the as-synthesized
(≈15%) and the functionalized nanoparticles (≈35%) can
be explained by the decreased specific surface of the aggregates,
which results in less adsorbed organics per total mass. However, the
theoretical decrease of specific surface is greater than the measured
values. This could be explained by the fact that the surface on the
inside of the aggregates is inaccessible for the ligand molecules
due to steric hindrance within the aggregate pore structure.

Figure 7 Thermogravimetric
analysis of as-synthesized (SPIONs, black) and functionalized (GNTA-SPIONs,
blue) iron oxide particles as well as functionalized spray-dried iron
oxide aggregates (GNTA-SD-SPIONs, green).

Nonetheless, FT-IR spectroscopy gives strong indications toward the
successful coupling of the two individual molecules to form the bifunctional
structure as well as the subsequent decoration of the particles with
the as-prepared ligand also for the spray-dried particles (Figure 8). Besides the very
strong peak at 1075 cm–1 for the asymmetrical Si–O–C
stretching vibration, the linker (3-glycidyloxypropyl)trimethoxysilane
(GLYMO) shows two peaks typical for epoxy rings at 3052 cm–1 for the C–H tension of the methylene group and at 908 cm–1 for the C–O deformation vibration of the oxirane
group prior to reaction.40 The broad peak
in the range of 3500–3400 cm–1 indicates
the stretching vibration, while the peak at 1630 cm–1 shows the deformation vibration of the N–H bond of a primary
amine Nα,Nα-bis(carboxymethyl)-l-lysine hydrate (l-NTA).40 Upon coupling and consequently
after functionalization, the peaks of the epoxy group disappear and
those of the ethoxysilane group are greatly reduced, proving the crosslinking
of the starting substances.41 Furthermore,
the functionalized particles show a slight shift of the peak at 1630
cm–1 toward lower wavenumbers and an increase in
the intensity of the peak at 1580 cm–1, indicating
the presence of a secondary amine.40

particles (GNTA-SPIONs, blue; GNTA-SD-SPIONs, green).

The magnetic separability of selected aggregates with different
iron oxide-to-silica compositions was evaluated using the basic reactor
setup presented by Gädke et al.42 For the basic separation efficiency experiments, an abiotic system
was used, suspending the nonfunctionalized particles in deionized
water. The complete reactor volume was cycled through the external
loop seven times to ensure comparability with the previous findings.
The results are presented in Table 1, showing that even when halving the content of magnetic
FexOy nanoparticles
in the aggregates, the threshold of 90% separation efficiency is reached.
Hence, the use of these aggregates in further applications is promising
to be a lot more cost-efficient in direct comparison with the pure
SD-SPIONs considering the inexpensive synthesis of silica nanoparticles
compared to the nonaqueous preparation of the FexOy nanoparticles utilized here.

a Measured in different cultivation systems (shake flask) using identical
magnets.

Additionally, it
was shown that the recovery of magnetic particles can be increased
in comparison to functionalized SPIONs due to the improved magnetic
separability of the aggregates. When GNTA-SPIONs are applied in the
in situ purification in shaking flasks, an average particle loss of
approximately 30% per cycle over five consecutive cycles is detected.17 In contrast, on average, 93% of the GNTA-SD-SPIONs
are retained during the separation process in shaking flasks.

The purity of the product was determined after each separation step
as it is crucial for its evaluation. Figure 9 shows the sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide
gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) of recombinant protein A after elution
from regenerated GNTA-SD-SPIONs. Duplicates after cycles 3, 4, and
5 as well as a protein size reference are depicted. The separated
product shows a protein lane at approximately 27 kDa as expected.
The second line that can be seen at around 60 kDa can be attributed
to agglomerates caused by the high concentration during the precipitation
with ammonium sulfate used to enhance sensitivity. Assuming the bands
at ≈60 kDa to be agglomerates of the protein, the purity of
protein A is calculated to be 88.2 ± 9.4% with regard to protein
compounds.

The integrated automation of a lab-scale stirred-tank
reactor for the production, in situ separation, and purification of
recombinant proteins utilizing the functionalized spray-dried pure
SPION aggregates was reported by Gädke et al.42

Conclusions
We presented the successful synthesis of
SPIONs and their structuring in a spray-drying process. Moreover,
the straightforward possibility to tailor the morphology and magnetic
properties of the aggregates by adjusting the ratio of SPIONs and
silica nanoparticles in the feed suspension was demonstrated. On the
one hand, the morphology of the resulting aggregates changed from
irregularly shaped, inflated spheres with a very high iron oxide content
to spherical structures when the silica content was increased to 20%
or higher. On the other hand, the magnetic behavior of the product
remained superparamagnetic, similar to the primary iron oxide nanoparticles
despite the size of the aggregates being several hundred single-core
diameters. Additionally, the saturation magnetization is slightly
enhanced compared to that of primary SPIONs. Hence, we conclude that
the SPIONs were still sufficiently separated within the structured
particle to avoid coalescence of the magnetic cores, while enabling
positive magnetic interaction. In a subsequent step, the functionalization
of pure iron oxide aggregates analogous to a previously reported nanoparticle
modification was successfully performed to achieve a highly selective
but reversible coupling of tagged proteins, although the reduction
of the specific surface area and thus the number of ligand molecules
that can be attached to the particles leads to a smaller amount of
sites for protein binding. The magnetic separability of aggregates
with differing silica contents was proven in an abiotic setup, revealing
a separation efficiency >90% even with a magnetic particle content
of only 50%. The increased magnetic separability in comparison to
individual nanoparticles is expected to overcompensate the reduction
of active binding sites in the presented application of protein separation.
Finally, the functionalized SD iron oxide aggregates were successfully
used in affinity separation processes to purify recombinant proteins.
Here, the spray-dried GNTA-SD-SPIONs showed superiority over nonstructured
GNTA-SPIONs due to their defined structure, which remains unchanged
throughout several recovery cycles, and their fast and facile magnetic
separation. Therefore, the presented system shows substantial advantages
with regard to multicycle reusability and is highly promising for
preparative applications in biotechnology also at larger scales.

Experimental
Section
Materials
Iron(III) acetylacetonate (99.9%), triethylene
glycol (ReagentPlus, 99.0%), (3-glycidyloxypropyl)trimethoxysilane
(98.0%) (GLYMO), Nα,Nα-bis(carboxymethyl)-l-lysine hydrate (97.0%)
(l-NTA, so-called due to the structural similarity with nitrilotriacetic
acid (NTA)), tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS), NaOH, and HCl were purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich and were used as received. Deionized water (in-house
reverse-osmosis equipment) was used for all experiments.

Synthesis
Superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) were synthesized
in a benchtop reactor (Model 4568, Parr Instrument Company, Moline,
IL) according to Grabs et al.43 using iron(III)
acetylacetonate as a metal–organic precursor and triethylene
glycol as the solvent. The reaction was conducted for 24 h at 200
°C. The product was washed three times with ethyl acetate and
transferred to deionized water for further processing or dried in
a desiccator for analysis purposes. The primary particles that are
obtained after synthesis are of spherical morphology with a particle
size of 6–7 nm in agreement with Masthoff et al. (data not
shown).32

SiO2 particles
were synthesized applying the Stöber process26,44 in a glass reactor (Büchi AG, Uster, Switzerland) at a reaction
temperature of 6 °C by adding 101 mL of TEOS to a solution of
ammonium hydroxide (10.1 mL) in 602 mL of ethanol and 76.8 mL of deionized
water and allowing to react for 24 h. The silica particles have a
median diameter x50,3 of approximately
200 nm (Supporting Information Figure S1).

Spray-Drying of Iron Oxide Nanoparticles
Aggregates
were prepared by spray-drying an aqueous nanoparticle suspension with
5% w/w solid content of iron oxide nanoparticles (Figure 1A, top). The spray-drying process
conditions in the used lab-scale spray-dryer (4M8-Trix, ProCepT Inc.,
Zelzate, Belgium) were a drying temperature of 100 °C, a pump
rate of 2.96 mL min–1, and an air speed of 0.30
m3 min–1 using a two-fluid nozzle with
a diameter of 0.8 μm. The obtained product is denoted as SD-SPION.

Spray-Drying of Mixtures of Iron Oxide and Silica Nanoparticles
To investigate the possibility to tailor the magnetization of the
SD aggregates, the composition of the suspensions was changed using
a mixture of varying amounts of iron oxide and silica particles, while
maintaining the total solid content at a constant level. Silica particles
(size 200 nm) were spray-dried with the previously described SPIONs.
The spray-drying conditions were kept constant in comparison to the
pure iron oxide spray-drying process. The obtained products were denoted
as SD-SiO2-SPION-XX, giving the iron oxide nanoparticle
content expressed as a percentage, for example, SD-SiO2-SPION-90 with 90% iron oxide and 10% silica nanoparticles, respectively.

Ligand Coupling
The desired binding functionality with the
target proteins was accomplished by using the capability of groups
structurally similar to NTA to build chelation bonds with divalent
metal ions such as Ni2+. The ligand was prepared as described
by Masthoff et al. by coupling GLYMO and L-NTA, being structurally
similar to NTA, to obtain GNTA.39 Briefly,
1.41 g of L-NTA was added to a solution of 14.13 mL of NaOH (10 M)
and 25.00 mL of deionized water. This solution was cooled to 0 °C
in an ice bath before 1.19 mL of GNTA was added dropwise under rigorous
stirring. After subsequent warm-up to room temperature within 5 h,
the reaction mixture was heated to 65 °C and stirred overnight.
Subsequently, the pH of the resulting solution was adjusted to 11
by adding hydrogen chloride (6 M) prior to further processing.

Functionalization
The prepared pure iron oxide SD-SPIONs were functionalized with
the GNTA-ligand (Figure 1A, bottom) adapting the method described by Masthoff et al.39 Since the SD aggregates are prone to sedimentation,
they have to be agitated during the reaction to ensure complete functionalization,
which was realized in a benchtop reactor (Model 4568, Parr Instrument
Company, Moline, IL) under stirring at 150
min–1. The ligand solution (8.6 mL) was used after
adjusting pH = 11. Then, SD-SPIONs were suspended in deionized water
to a concentration of 10 mg mL–1 and added to the
ligand solution. Subsequently, the suspension was heated to 95 °C
for 4 h and afterward left to cool down to room temperature overnight.
Afterward, the aggregates were washed thoroughly with deionized water
and dried in a desiccator for storage.

Application
The
cultivation, synthesis, and purification of the model protein with
functionalized SPIONs have been presented in a previous study17 and thus will only be described shortly. Protein
A was recombinantly produced and secreted from Bacillus
megaterium MS 941 that was transformed with a recombinant
plasmid encoding a truncated protein A with a histidine 6-tag (His6) at the C-terminal end.17,45 The bacterial
strain was cultivated in a defined medium at 37 °C in a shaking
flask as a preculture and inoculated for production in a DASGIP bioreactor
(TC4 SC4; MX4/4; PH4 PO4; CWD 4; MP8, DASGIP Information and Process
Technology, Jülich, Germany), adding xylose (5 g L–1) to induce the production (cultivation parameters in Table S1). The in situ separation of the recombinant
protein (concentration reached, 90 mg mL–1) from
the growth medium occurred during the exponential growth phase when
functionalized particles were added to a final concentration of 0.6
mg mL–1 and magnetically separated after 10 min
by pumping the medium through an external loop with an attached permanent
magnet.42 The application concept is depicted
in Figure 1B. Subsequently,
the loaded particles were washed, and recombinant proteins were eluted
from the particles with appropriate buffers (compare Tables S2 and S3) before the particles were regenerated and
collected to be reloaded with Ni2+ (see Tables S4 and S5) to regain the specific absorption capacity.
Eluted proteins were analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide
gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) as described previously.17 Finally, after further cultivation, the particles
were added back into the bioreactor for an additional separation cycle.

Characterization
X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were
conducted using an EMPYREAN device (PANalytical B.V., Almelo, The
Netherlands) at a wavelength of Kα = 0.154 nm with copper radiation (Empyrean Cu LFF HR) in a range
of 2θ from 15 to 70° and a step size of 0.05° (PIXcel-3D
detector, Malvern Panalytical Ltd., Malvern, U.K.).

Particle
size analysis of the SD aggregates both with and without functionalization
was conducted on a HELOS/BF laser diffraction device (Sympatec GmbH,
Clausthal-Zellerfeld, Germany) equipped with a wet dispersing system
CUVETTE. The sample was dispersed in water and stirred manually. For
the initial evaluation of the mechanical integrity, the sample was
stressed with ultrasonication (US) using the built-in US-finger at
100% intensity for 30 s.

The morphology of spray-dried aggregates
was analyzed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). SEM images
were taken with an LEO 1550 device (Carl Zeiss Microscopy GmbH, Jena,
Germany).

The magnetic properties of the as-synthesized iron
oxide nanoparticles as well as all SD aggregates were analyzed with
a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID). The SQUID measurements
were conducted with a Magnetic Property Measurement System (Quantum
Design Inc., San Diego, CA). The magnetization was measured at 300
K, and the magnetic flux density was varied between −5 and
5 T.

The specific surface areas of the prepared aggregates of
pure iron oxide were analyzed with a Nova 2000e Surface Area &
Pore Size Analyzer (Quantachrome GmbH & Co. KG, Odelzhausen, Germany).

The amount of functionalization agent attached to the particle
surface was investigated by applying thermogravimetric analysis. The
sample under investigation (15 mg) was heated from 25 to 700 °C
with a constant heating rate of 10 °C min–1. A TGA/DSC 1 STARe system (Mettler-Toledo AG, Schwerzenbach,
Switzerland) was used for the investigation. The coupling of the ligand
as well as its binding onto the surface of the spray-dried aggregates
was evaluated via Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR)
with Vertex 70 (Bruker Corporation, Billerica, MA). The magnetic separability
