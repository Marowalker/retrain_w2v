As
common coinage metals, silver and silver compounds have very
rich application in the organic catalytic reaction. Immobilization
of silver compounds on heterogeneous media is the most common way
used in industrial catalytic reactions. In this work, we designed
and synthesized a new heterogeneous porous silver catalyst, with in
situ-formed Ag–S rods as connecting nodes and thiosemicarbazide-functionalized
linear ligands, used in both σ- and π-catalytic transformations.
Strong Ag–S bonds bypassed the loss of noble silver elements
and inhibited the formation of nonporous silver particles which always
led to the decrease of yields in homogenous reactions. Furthermore,
various derivatives of propargylamines and phenylacetylenes were applied
as both σ and π-active substrates with moderate to good
yields.

Introduction
As an important branch
of synthetic chemistry, heterocatalysis
has received increasing attention because of the potential industrial
feasibility, low metallic residues, and low loss of catalysts.1−3 Increasing heterogenous synthetic methods have been applied to the
various synthesis of value-added, structurally complex compounds.
In terms of high porosity and specific surface area, heterogeneous
porous materials offer many advantages over nonporous heterogeneous
materials in the field of catalysis.4−6 With the periodic open
structures and controllable pores, metal–organic frameworks
(MOFs) or porous coordination polymers (PCPs) are appealing porous
heterogeneous catalysts for the value-added chemical transformation.7−10

Silver is the most commonly used metal catalyst in both fine
organic
synthetic and chemical industry.11−16 Given the specifical electronic configuration, silver catalysts
could play a characteristic double catalytic activity, σ-activation
and π-activation, in chemical transformation.9,17−20 With the versatile catalytic activation,21−23 heterogeneous
silver catalysts have been reported, especially immobilizing silver
atoms or silver nanoparticles in the pores of MOFs.24−27 In most of these reported silver
MOF catalysts, Ag atoms were incorporated as guests in pores through
postsynthetic methods or were incorporated into the nodes with relatively
weak Ag–N or Ag–O bonds, which could not provide enough
chemical stability in σ-activation and π-activation transformation.28,29 Very recently, our group has reported the first example of two silver
MOFs consolidated with strong Ag–S cluster nodes used as effective
π-active catalysts.30 Herein, we
developed the aforementioned synthetic strategy of the catalyst with
sulfur-rich ligands, in which double-helical Ag–S rods were
used as the basic building blocks with high density of open catalytic
sites (named as Ag-MOF-1 here and after, Scheme 1). Given the good chemical stability of Ag–S
bonds and the large pores, this catalyst Ag-MOF-1 was applicable for
both σ-activation and π-activation transformation of alkynes
and CO2.

Results and Discussion
Synthesis
and Structure of Ag-MOF-1
Ligand L was prepared
from a Schiff base reaction of thiosemicarbazide and 1,4-phthalaldehyde
in a high yield. The target crystalline materials were obtained by
slowly diffusing CF3COOAg into the solution of ligands
L. Single-crystal structure analysis suggested that the double-helical
rodlike SBUs (secondary building units) formed with silver atoms and
bridging sulfur atoms through a glide reflection symmetry. Each Ag
atom coordinated to four sulfur atoms from four different ligands
in distorted tetrahedral coordinating configuration with an average
Ag–S distance of 2.63 Å, in which three of the sulfur
atoms were posited at one plane with the center Ag atom and another
sulfur atom was served as an axial ligand (Figure 1a). The counter anions were fixed around
the thiourea motifs through H-bonding interactions and were not directly
coordinated to Ag atoms, with the minimum distances of 3.18 Å
between Ag and O atoms. This opening configuration of Ag sites endows
both σ- and π-interaction of Ag atoms with substrates
containing unsaturated triple C–C bonds. With linear thiourea-functionalized
ligands as linkers between Ag–S rod SBUs, the 3D frameworks
were consolidated with the Ibca space group and square channels (Figure 1b–d). The cross-sectional area of
the channel is about 12.5 × 18.1 Å2. The channel
has enough space to charge substrates and provides the possibility
for catalyzing the reaction of alkyne derivatives. On the surface
of the Ag–S rods, there are abundant H-bonding donors (−NH2 and −NH−) and H-bonding acceptors (C=N–
and sulfur). The potential hydrogen-bonding interactions with substrates
can be provided by the donors and acceptors which play an important
role in synergistically activation and fixation in catalytic reaction.

of Ag-MOF-1 with the 1D channel.

With the rod SBUs consolidated by the strong Ag–S
bond,
Ag-MOF-1 exhibited good stability. A significant stable platform ranging
from 25 to 220 °C could be observed from the thermogravimetry
(TG) analysis curve (Figure 2b). After soaking in various solvents for 24 h, the similar
powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) pattern with the as-synthetic crystals
was observed (Figures 2a and S3). Furthermore, the well-proportioned
green fluorescence of Ag-MOF-1 absorbing fluorescein, in the confocal
laser scan microscopy photograph, indicated the thorough penetration
of fluorescein into the channels of Ag-MOF-1 (Figure 2c,d). Both of these results suggested that
the good stability of 1D channels of Ag-MOF-1 in solution.

Characterizations and Catalytic Experiments
Because
of the specific d-electron configuration, the activation between Ag
and unsaturated C–C bonds with the π-interaction has
been well-known. The π-catalysis experiments initially focused
on the cycloaddition transformation of propargylamine and CO2 as the negative-cost C1 source31−34 (Table 1). The reaction was conducted in a 10 mL
Schlenk tube with a 1 mmol of propargylamine and 1 atm CO2 at room temperature. In the presence of 1.5 mmol of 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene
(DBU), a 20 mg Ag-MOF-1 catalyst afforded almost complete conversion
within 24 h. In control experiments, homogeneous CF3COOAg
exhibited significantly less catalytic activation. Only trace yield
was obtained with Ag2S as catalysts or without any catalysts.
Furthermore, various propargylamine derivatives were applied to this
catalytic system with good to moderate yields. Especially, significant
decrease in yields was observed, which suggested that the cycloaddition
transformation was highly depended on the molecular size of propargylamine
derivatives. The aryl-substituted derivatives, which have a larger
molecule size, led to a lower conversion.

Table 1 π-Active
Catalysis with Various
Propargylamine Derivatives and CO2.a
a The yields were
determined using 1H NMR spectroscopy.

Compared with the direct active
interaction of the π-model,
σ-activation needs a more delicate design for the synergistic
effect of the carbon–Ag interaction and deprotonation, which
could be completed by the open sites on Ag–S rods and the high-density
base sites on thiosemicarbazide motifs. The σ-activation catalysis
experiments initially focused on the atom-economy transformation of
phenylacetylene into phenylpropionic acid with CO235−39 (Table 2). The reaction
was conducted in a 10 mL autoclave reactor with 1 mmol of phenylacetylene
and 0.4 MPa CO2 at 50 °C. In the presence of 1.5 mmol
of Cs2CO3, a 20 mg Ag-MOF-1 catalyst afforded
79% conversion of the aforementioned reaction within 24 h. Homogeneous
CF3COOAg exhibited significantly less catalytic activation.
Only trace yield was obtained with Ag2S as catalysts or
without any catalysts. Alcohol was selected as the optimized solvent.
Moderate pressure (0.4 MPa) was needed to increase the solubility
of CO2 in alcohol. Furthermore, Ag-MOF-1 was applied to
various alkyne derivatives with moderate yield under optimized conditions.
In both of these σ/π-activation catalyses, simple homogeneous
silver salt exhibited significantly less catalytic activation, which
may be due to the formation of nonporous heterogeneous silver particles,
and the specific surface area of nonporous silver particles was much
less than that of well-dispersed Ag–S rods in porous frameworks.

Terminal Alkynes and CO2.a

After absorbing substrate molecules,
phenylacetylene, the characteristic
peak of substrate molecules could be observed clearly in laser Raman
confocal spectra (Figure 3a).40 The peaks at 1000 and 2112
cm–1 in Raman spectra were assigned to the ring-breathing
vibration and C≡C vibration, respectively. These emerging characteristic
peaks confirmed the substrate molecules could diffuse into the pores
of Ag-MOF-1. Given the intrinsic crystallization of MOFs, guest molecules
in the pores of MOFs could be directly observed by X-ray technology.
Soaking Ag-MOF-1 crystals in phenylacetylene solution, phenylacetylene
molecules could diffuse into the pores and be fixed through multiple
hydrogen bonding interactions and π–π stacking
interactions with the aryl and thiosemicarbazide motifs on the intrasurface
of the pores (Figure 3b). In traditional impress, the Ag–S compound was typically
inert in the catalytic reaction. In many Ag-catalytic processes, sulfur
and sulfur-containing compounds were typical toxic reagents, which
could inhibit catalytic activation. In this work, through a delicate
design of ligands and synthetic methods, a well-oriented and separated
rodlike Ag–S compound was synthesized and fixed in the porous
frameworks with open catalytic sites. The open sites of Ag–S
rods provided catalytic activation. Thiosemicarbazide motifs provided
hydrogen-bonding sites interacting with substrate molecules. Both
open sites of Ag–S rods and hydrogen-bonding sites on thiosemicarbazide
motifs synergistically facilitated the σ and π-active
transformation. Time-dependent 1H NMR spectra of reaction
mixture solution in σ and π-catalytic processes clearly
showed the gradual transformation, in which the peaks of reactants
decreased and the peaks of products increased (Figure 3c,d).

and products were highlighted by violet heart shape and red-cross

Conclusions
In conclusion, we developed our previous
reported synthetic methodology
about the design and synthesis of Ag–S-based porous frameworks.
A new Ag–S-based porous framework with double-helical Ag–S
rods as connecting nodes and linear thiosemicarbazide-functional ligands
was synthesized and used in both σ and π-catalytic transformation
with moderate to good yields for various propargylamine derivatives
and phenylacetylene derivatives. The strong Ag–S bond provided
enough chemical stability, bypassing the formation of nonporous heterogeneous
particles which could decrease the catalytic efficiency in a homogenous
catalytic process with simple soluble silver salts as catalysts. The
rich hydrogen-bonding sites in pores enhanced the interaction between
frameworks and reactants. Intrinsic crystallization of MOFs endowed
the direct observation of the phenylacetylene-containing crystal in
situ. Good chemical stability, effective synergetic interaction of
open sites on Ag–S rods and H-bonding sites, and clear mechanism
endowed this catalyst-designed methodology with great advantages in
Ag-catalytic industrial reaction.

Experimental Section
Materials
and Measurements
All chemicals were of reagent
grade quality and were obtained from commercial sources and used without
further purification. A Rigaku Smart Lab XRD instrument with a sealed
Cu tube (λ = 1.54178 Å) was used in PXRD measurements.
A Varian INOVA 500 M spectrometer was used to perform 1H NMR with tetramethylsilane as the internal reference. Dalian Institute
of Special Gases provided carbon dioxide (99.995%), which can be used
as received. Raman spectroscopy (Lab Raman HR Evolution) measurements
were performed using a solid-state 633 nm laser, and a laser power
of 25% was used. A JASCO FT-IR-430 instrument was used to record Fourier
transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra which used KBr pellets. An Olympus
Fluoview FV1000 instrument was used to record confocal laser scanning
microscopy micrographs with λex = 488 nm. A Thermo
Fisher-6700 instrument was used to perform diffuse reflectance FT-IR
spectra. A Mettler Toledo TGA/SDTA851 instrument was used in thermogravimetric
analyses and applied under N2, with a ramp of 10 °C
min–1 up to 800 °C.

Synthesis of Ligand (L)
A mixture of 1,4-phthalaldehyde
(0.13 g, 1 mmol), thiosemicarbazide (0.19 g, 2.2 mmol), and 0.5 mL
acetic acid in 150 mL of alcohol was stirred at 80 °C for 24
h. Then, a yellow product was isolated by filtration and washed with
ether three times to get dry products. Yield: 99%, 0.28 g. (The 1H NMR spectrum was Figure S4).

Synthesis of Ag-MOF-1
CF3COOAg was dissolved
in acetonitrile to form solution 1 (0.02 mol/L). The ligand L was
dissolved in N,N-dimethylformamide
(DMF) to form solution 2 (0.02 mol/L). Then, 1 mL solution 2 was dropped
into the lower layer of the glass tube. 5 mL mixed solution (DMF:
acetonitrile v/v = 1:1) was used as the intermediate layer. 1 mL solution
1 was used as the upper layer. The tube was sealed and stored in the
dark for 1 month. The colorless crystals were afforded. Yield: 60%
(based on Ag).

Single-Crystal Analysis
X-ray intensity
data were carried
out on a Bruker SMART APEX charge-coupled device-based diffractometer
(Mo Kα radiation, λ 0.71073 Å) with the SAINT and
SMART programs. The SAINT software was used in the data integration
and reduction. Empirical absorption correction, which was applied
to the collected reflection, worked with SADABS. SHELXTL was used
to solve the structures in direct methods, which was refined on F2 by the full-matrix least-squares method with
the program SHELXL-97.41−43

Synthesis of Substrates
The substrates
in Table 2 were purchased
from
Energy Chemical and used without further purification. The substrates
in Table 1 were prepared
according to previous ref (30).

π-Activation Catalysis Experiments
Propargylamine
(1 mmol) and acetonitrile (5 mL), in the presence of 1.5 mmol of DBU
and 20 mg Ag-MOF-1 catalyst, were added in a 10 mL Schlenk tube. The
reaction solution was degassed with CO2 for 20 min, and
then, the reaction was sustained with 1 atm CO2 at room
temperature for 1 day. The yields were determined by using 1H NMR spectroscopy.

σ-Activation Catalysis Experiments
Phenylacetylene
(1 mmol) and alcohol (5 mL), in the presence of 1.5 mmol of Cs2CO3 and 20 mg Ag-MOF-1 catalyst, were added in
a 10 mL autoclave reactor. The reaction solution was degassed with
CO2 for 20 min, and then the reaction was sustained with
4 atm CO2 at 50 °C for 1 day. The yields were determined
by isolating pure products.

Isolation Method of Products of the π-Catalysis
Experiments
The organic phase was collected and then purified
by flash column
chromatography on silica gel (n-hexane/ethyl acetate)
(v/v = 1:1) to isolate the desired products.

Isolation Method of Products
of the σ-Catalysis Experiments
The reaction mixture
was diluted with water (30 mL) and extracted
with n-hexane (2 × 20 mL). The aqueous layer
was acidified with aqueous HCl (6 N, 20 mL) at low temperatures and
then extracted with ethyl acetate (4 × 30 mL). The combined organic
layers were washed with water and brine, dried over Na2SO4, and filtered. The solvent was removed under vacuum
to afford the acid products.36
