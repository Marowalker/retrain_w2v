A high-quality porous CoNi2S4 nanoplates
array was in situ synthesized on carbon fibers (CFs) by a hydrothermal
method via a CoNi-layered double hydroxide (LDH) precursor transformation
process. The CoNi2S4@CFs electrode exhibits
largely enhanced supercapacitor performance with a specific capacitance
of 1724 F/g at 1 A/g, in comparison with that of the CoNi-LDH (1302
F/g) precursor. Furthermore, the CoNi2S4@CF
electrode shows an extremely high rate capability with capacity retention
of 79% under a charge density of 60 A/g, whereas the retention rate
of CoNi-LDH@CFs is only ∼34%. The abundant pore structure,
improved electrical conductivity, and lower internal resistances of
CoNi2S4@CFs (1.0 Ω) compared to those
of CoNi-LDH@CFs (9.5 Ω) are responsible for the enhancement
of energy storage performance. By using the CoNi2S4 nanoplate array as the positive electrode, an all-solid-state
asymmetric fiber-shaped supercapacitor was further obtained, which
exhibits outstanding flexible, foldable, and wearable capability.
In view of the component tunability for LDH materials, the hydroxide
precursor transformation method with merits of mild conditions and
easy operation can be extended to the synthesis of a variety of metal
sulfides for broad applications in electronic devices.

1 Introduction
As
one important type of energy storage device, supercapacitors
(SCs) have attracted tremendous attention because of their fast charging/discharging,
high power density, and long service life.1−4 Pseudocapacitive transition-metal
oxides and hydroxides5−11 have been widely investigated as promising SC materials due to their
high redox activity and ease of preparation. Nevertheless, they generally
suffer from inadequate electrical conductivity, resulting in limited
rate performance and low power density at a high discharging rate.
To overcome these obstacles, anion doping or substitution by nonmetallic
elements such as nitrogen, sulfur, or phosphorus has been proved to
be an effective strategy to improve the electrical conductivity.12−15 Among these materials, CoNi2S4 is regarded
as a promising alternative with the advantages of high capacitance,
superior conductivity, and acceptable cost.16−19 In particular, CoNi2S4 exhibits an excellent electrical conductivity that
is ∼100 times higher than that of CoNi2O420,21 as a result of its smaller band gap energy.22 In addition, CoNi2S4 possesses
multiple oxidation states that are capable of enriching redox reactions
compared to single-metal sulfides, in the same way as that in CoNi2O4 versus NiOx (or
CoOx) electrodes. However, its practical
application is still hindered by rigorous synthesis conditions, such
as high operation temperature (above 400 °C) and use of toxic
gases (H2S) or thiourea as the sulfur source.20,21,23 Therefore, it is highly desired
to develop a mild and environmentally friendly method for the facile
synthesis of transition-metal sulfides.

Flexible fiber-shaped
SCs (FSSCs) as a new type of SCs emerged
in response to the demand of portability, flexibility, wearability,
and braided characteristics for next-generation electronic devices.24 In numerous studies, carbon fibers (CFs) have
been judged as optimal alternative electrodes as a result of their
high strength, electrical/thermal conductivities, and low-cost.25 However, CFs can only offer an unsatisfactory
low energy density due to the electrical double-layer charge storage
mechanism, which restricts their practical application as energy storage
devices. To this end, it is still a big challenge to develop a new
kind of fiber electrode material integrating high energy density,
good rate capability, and mechanical flexibility.

Herein, we
designed and fabricated a hierarchical electrode for
high-performance FSSCs, which is composed of high-quality CoNi2S4 nanoplate arrays anchored on a CF backbone (denoted
as CoNi2S4@CFs). A hydrothermal in situ vulcanization
method was used to obtain such an electrode, which shows advantages
of low synthesis temperature and simple operation. The resulting CoNi2S4@CF electrode exhibits high capacitance, good
rate performance, and excellent cycling stability, as a result of
a synergistic effect among the nanoarray architecture, good conductivity
of CFs, and high pseudocapacitive activity of CoNi2S4. In addition, the porous structure resulting from the vulcanization
process provides numerous active sites for the transport of electrolyte
ions. By considering the elemental tunability of LDHs, the hydrothermal
in situ vulcanization method presented in this work can be extended
to the preparation of other double- or multimetal sulfides, which
show broad applications in energy storage and conversion systems.

2 Results and Discussion
The CoNi2S4 nanoplate array was prepared
by a two-step process, which involves the in situ growth of CoNi-layered
double hydroxide (LDH) on CFs followed by a vulcanization treatment
(as shown in Scheme 1). Figure 1A shows
a typical scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of the primary
CFs, which displays an electrically conductive network consisting
of numerous individual uniform fibers with a diameter of ∼6
μm. From the enlarged SEM photograph (Figure 1B), a relatively smooth surface can be observed.
After acid treatment, some irregular bulges appear on the surface
of the CFs (Figure 1C), which are caused by the modification of functional groups (e.g.,
carbonyl, carboxyl, and hydroxyl), resulting in a greatly increased
roughness. In addition, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) displays
two strong peaks at 284.6 and 286.1 eV ascribed to C–C and
−COH groups for pristine CFs (Figure S1, Supporting Information). New peaks appear at 286.8 and 288.7
eV after acid treatment, which is indicative of the surface modification
by −C=O (epoxide) and −C=O (O–C=O)
groups.26 These functional groups not only
facilitate the dispersion of CFs in aqueous solution but also serve
as nucleation centers for the deposition of LDH.

Scheme 1 Schematic Illustration
for the Synthesis of CoNi2S4@CFs
CoNi-LDH was grown vertically on the CF filament
by a facile hydrothermal
method in the presence of hexadecyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB).
As shown in Figure 1D–F, LDH nanoplate arrays with a plate thickness of ∼15
nm can be observed to interlace with each other, forming an opened
macroporous structure. Corresponding energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometry
(EDS) mapping analysis shows that the ratio of Co/Ni in the LDH is
close to 1:2 (Figure S2, Supporting Information). The mass ratio of CoNi-LDH/CFs is around 1:11 in the hybrid fibers,
obtained by comparing the weight deference before and after LDH deposition.

The X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of the as-prepared CoNi-LDH
arrays (Figure 2A,
bottom line) shows a series of reflections at 10.1°, 20.2°,
34.8°, 38.9°, 59.7°, and 60.9°, which, respectively,
correspond to the [003], [006], [012], [015], [110], and [113] diffractions
of the typical LDH phase,27−30 indicating their high crystallinity and purity. After
a hydrothermal vulcanization treatment in sodium sulfide solution,
the diffraction peaks of CoNi-LDH completely disappear; while new
diffraction peaks appear at 2θ = 26.7°, 31.5°, 38.2°,
50.3°, and 55.0° (Figure 2A, top line), corresponding to [220], [311], [400],
[511], and [440] of the CoNi2S4 spinel structure,20−22 respectively. The SEM image shows that the thickness of the nanoplates
was reduced to ∼10 nm (Figure 2B). EDS mapping results (Figures 2C and S3) show
a uniform distribution of the Co, Ni, and S elements, with Co/Ni of
∼1/2, indicating no obvious loss of metal elements after vulcanization.

patterns of CoNi-LDH and CoNi2S4.
(B) SEM image and (C) EDS spectrum of the CoNi2S4 nanoplate. (D–F) TEM and HR-TEM images of the CoNi2S4 nanoplate.

Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) observation shows
that the
CoNi2S4 bimetallic sulfide nanoplates were interlaced
with each other (Figure 2D), in agreement with the SEM photograph (Figure 2B). A typical TEM image (Figure 2E) of one single nanoplate
displays a large number of nanopores in the CoNi2S4 plates. A series of lattice fringes with spacing of 0.55,
0.17, and 0.24 nm were observed in the high-resolution TEM (HR-TEM)
image (Figure 2F),
corresponding to the [111], [440], and [400] planes of CoNi2S4, respectively.31 These results
further confirm the formation of spinel-structured CoNi2S4 after hydrothermal vulcanization of CoNi-LDH.

To understand the detailed transformation process of the CoNi-LDH
precursor to spinel CoNi2S4, the structural
evolution with increasing vulcanization time (t)
was studied. XRD patterns (Figure 3) show that the layered structure of the CoNi-LDH precursor
was still preserved within the initial 45 min, accompanied by decreased
diffraction intensity as t increases. When the vulcanization
time reached 60 min, it was found that the LDH diffraction patterns
became very weak and new peaks appeared at 2θ = 31.5° and
55.0°, indicating the formation of the CoNi2S4 spinel structure. When the vulcanization time was extended
to 90 min, the diffraction peaks of LDH disappeared completely. Upon
further increasing the vulcanization time from 90 to 240 min, the
integral diffractions of CoNi2S4 at 31.5°,
38.2°, 50.3°, and 55.0° are increasingly obvious, implying
an increased crystallinity of the bimetal sulfide.

Figure 3 XRD patterns of CoNi2S4 obtained at different
vulcanization times.

The conductivity of electrode materials is of crucial importance
for their application in electrochemical energy-related fields. Current–voltage
(I–V) curves (Figure 4A) were used to measure the
conductivity of CoNi2S4 at different vulcanization
times. It was found that the slope of the I–V curves increased with extending t from
0 to 120 min, which indicates that the electric conductivity of the
material increased continuously. However, if the vulcanization time
was further increased to 240 min, the conductivity decreased, probably
because of the collapse of the array structure after long-time vulcanization.
In addition, the slope of the Tafel curve is also a common means to
characterize the internal electronic fluidity of electrode materials.
As shown in Figure 4B, the Tafel slope further proves that the electron transport property
of the material with t = 120 min was the optimum.

Figure 4 (A) I–V and (B) Tafel
curves of CoNi2S4 synthesized at different vulcanization
times.

The pore structure of the electrode
material determines the active
site exposure and diffusion kinetic of electrolyte ions and thereby
plays significant roles in the electrochemical energy storage. N2-adsorption/desorption measurement was carried out to investigate
the porosity property of the CoNi2S4@CFs composite,
with precursor CoNi-LDH@CFs as a reference sample (Figure 5). CoNi-LDH and CoNi2S4 show Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface
areas of 35.35 and 47.95 m2 g–1, respectively,
with type-IV isotherms, indicating mesoporous structures for both
materials (Figure 5A). Based on the pore-size distribution curves (Figure 5B), we can conclude that the
pore sizes of CoNi-LDH and CoNi2S4 are both
mainly distributed at 20 nm, ascribed to the interlaced stacking of
the nanoplates. Besides, it is noteworthy that CoNi2S4 also displays a pore-size distribution at ∼30 nm,
demonstrating that the hydrothermal vulcanization treatment leads
to the formation of nanopores in the CoNi2S plates, which
is consistent with the TEM observation (Figure 2E). The enriched pore structure could increase
the contact between the electrode material and the electrolyte, which
will greatly reduce the diffusion resistance of the electrolyte ions
and provide more reactive sites to promote the Faraday redox reaction.

sorption isotherms and (B) pore-size distribution
of the CoNi-LDH@CFs and CoNi2S4@CFs electrodes.

The valence state of the obtained
CoNi-LDH and CoNi2S4 materials are characterized
by XPS, as presented in Figure 6A–C. For both
CoNi-LDH and CoNi2S4, the spectrum of the Ni
2p3/2 main peak (Figure 6A) can be differentiated into two peaks, locating at
853.2 and 856.5 eV, which are ascribed to Ni2+ and Ni3+, respectively.32 The peaks appearing
at 778.2 and 783.2 eV (Figure 6B) correspond to Co3+ and Co2+, respectively.33 It is noted that, the relative ratio of Co3+/Co2+ decreases and that of Ni3+/Ni2+ increases after vulcanization treatment, indicating the
reduction of cobalt and oxidation of nickel upon transformation of
CoNi-LDH to CoNi2S4. The typical spectra of
S in CoNi2S4 material can be divided into two
main peaks (Figure 6C): the peak at 163.2 eV can be attributed to the metal-sulfur bonds
and the peak below 162.0 eV is ascribed to the surface-sulfur bonds.34−36

Cyclic voltammogram (CV) curves
of the CoNi-LDH and CoNi2S4 electrodes recorded
at 60 mV s–1 in
a potential window of −0.20 to 0.60 V are shown in Figure 7A. A pair of redox
peaks at 0.10 and 0.45 V can be clearly observed in each curve as
a result of the Faradaic capacitive behavior, corresponding to the
redox reactions of Ni2+/Ni3+, Co2+/Co3+, and Co3+/Co4+. It is worth
noting that the integrated CV area of the CoNi2S4 electrode is significantly larger than that of the CoNi-LDH electrode,
which demonstrates that the specific capacitance of the electrode
is greatly enhanced after vulcanization. Additionally, the shape of
CV curves for the CoNi2S4 electrode remains
unchanged upon increasing the scan rate, with slightly shifted peak
position, indicating that the reaction is highly reversible (Figure 7B). The galvanostatic
charge/discharge (CD) curves exhibit remarkable pseudocapacitance
behavior for both CoNi-LDH and CoNi2S4 electrodes
(Figure 7C). The discharge
time of the CoNi2S4 electrode is much longer
than that of the CoNi-LDH electrode at the same discharging rate,
indicating a higher specific capacitance of CoNi2S4, in accordance with the CV results. When the current density
is 1 A/g, the calculated specific capacitance of the CoNi2S4 electrode is 1742 F/g; whereas the CoNi-LDH electrodes
only shows a capacitance of 1302 F/g. Besides, the CoNi2S4 electrode retains 89% of its original capacitance after
5000 cycles at 5 A/g, showing an excellent cycling stability of the
bimetallic sulfide (Figure 7D).

and CoNi2S4 electrodes.

Rate capability is a critical parameter of electrochemical
capacitors
for high-power applications. Figure 7E displays the high current charge and discharge characteristics
of the two electrodes as the current density increases from 1 to 60
A/g. The pristine CoNi-LDH electrode retains only ∼34% of the
initial capacitance at 60 A/g. In comparison, the CoNi2S4@CF hybrid electrode exhibits a much higher retention
of 79% at the same current density, demonstrating its superior high-rate
capability. The largely improved rate capability is believed to relate
with the increased conductivity and enriched porous structure upon
vulcanization treatment.

In addition, electrochemical impedance
spectroscopy (EIS) measurements
were carried out to understand the electron transport and ion transfer
property of the hybrid electrode. The EIS data reveal much smaller
internal resistances (1.0 Ω) in the Nyquist plots for the CoNi2S4@CF electrode as compared to that of the CoNi-LDH
electrode (9.5 Ω). Moreover, the larger slope of the straight
line for CoNi2S4 than CoNi-LDH means a facilitated
ion transport in the CoNi2S4 electrode, which
is ascribed to its more abundant porous structure. These results clearly
demonstrate that the CoNi2S4 arrays display
favorable charge-transfer kinetics and fast electron transport and
thus exhibit dramatically enhanced pseudocapacitive performances.

A micro all-solid-state asymmetric supercapacitor device was fabricated
to demonstrate the potential application of the CoNi2S4@CFs electrode (schematically shown in Figure 8A). Different from those of a three-electrode
system, the CV curves of the all-solid-state devices exhibit a rectangular
shape in a potential window of 0–1.0 V (Figure 8B). Compared with those of AC@CFs//AC@CFs
and CoNi-LDH@CFs//AC@CFs devices, the shape of CV curves for the CoNi2S4@CFs//AC@CFs supercapacitor exhibits a more excellent
rectangular characteristic. The CV curves at different scan rates
display a trend of nearly linear increase in current with the increasing
charge/discharge rate, indicating rapid electron-ion transmission
within the scan range (Figure 8C). Galvanostatic charge/discharge curves of the three devices
(Figure S4, Supporting Information) show
that the specific capacitances of the three devices are 632, 493,
and 240 F/g for CoNi2S4@CFs//AC@CFs, AC@CFs//AC@CFs,
and CoNi-LDH@CFs//AC@CFs, respectively. The specific capacitance of
the CoNi2S4@CFs//AC@CF supercapacitor is higher
than or comparable with that of previously reported microdevices.37−39 However, the Coulombic efficiency of our devices is relatively low,
which needs to be further improved.

architecture of the asymmetrical
wire-shaped SC device. (B) CV curves of CoNi-LDH@CFs//AC@CF, CoNi2S4@CFs//AC@CF, and AC@CFs//AC@CF devices at a scan

and 100 mV/s for CoNi2S4@CFs//AC@CF SCs. (D)
CV curve of the parallel device at scan rate of 50 mV/s. (E) CV curve
of the series device at a scan rate of 50 mV/s (the inset image shows
such a device driving a red light-emitting diode).

In view of the excellent mechanical properties
and flexibility
of CFs, this kind of supercapacitors can be easily operated in series
or parallel. Three individual CoNi-LDH@CF//AC@CF devices were connected
in series or in parallel to evaluate their electrochemical properties.
As shown in Figure 8D,E, both parallel and series devices show CV curves with similar
shapes as that of the single device, which exhibits its practicability
and extensibility. For the parallel device, its current trebles while
the voltage remains almost constant, in comparison with single supercapacitors.
Howxever, the series device shows nearly the same current but three
times the voltage as that of the single supercapacitors, which was
used to drive a red light-emitting diode (inset of Figure 8E). In addition, the fiber-shaped
CoNi2S4@CF//AC@CF supercapacitor can be further
woven into fabrics in a variety of series and parallel connections.
These results demonstrate that the CoNi2S4@CF//AC@CF
supercapacitor has broad application prospects in the field of flexible
and wearable devices.

3 Conclusions
In summary,
a facile and cost-effective route is developed to prepare
CoNi2S4@CF electrode materials for one-dimensional
FSSCs. In this integrated and hierarchical electrode, spinel CoNi2S4 porous nanoplate arrays were obtained by vulcanization
on a CoNi-LDH precursor, which has the advantages of mild conditions
and simple synthesis. The internal electron transport capability of
the CoNi2S4@CF electrode is nearly 10 times
higher than that of CoNi-LDH@CFs. Most significantly, the spinel-structured
CoNi2S4 shows a more abundant pore structure
compared with CoNi-LDH, which can greatly reduce the transport resistance
of electrolyte ions in the faradaic reactions. As a result, the CoNi2S4@CF hybrid electrode exhibits high specific capacitance,
desirable rate capability, as well as excellent cycling stability.
The CoNi2S4@CF electrode was further assembled
into a fiber-shaped micro-supercapacitor device, exhibiting good flexible
and wearable abilities, which has broad application prospects in next-generation
wearable electronics.

4 Experiment Section
4.1 Activation of CFs
The CFs were activated
with an acid modification method according to previous report.26 In brief, 0.5 g CFs were distributed uniformly
into a mixed H2SO4/HNO3 (volume ratio
3:1) solution at 60 °C for 3 h. After the treatment, the CFs
were taken out, washed using deionized water, and then dried at 60
°C for 6 h.

4.2 Preparation of CoNi-LDH
Arrays Precursor
The CoNi-LDH nanoplate array on CFs was
prepared using a simple
hydrothermal growth approach. Typically, Ni(NO3)2·6H2O, CoCl2·6H2O, and
CTAB were dissolved in 144 mL methanol/water mixed solution with the
volume ratio of 5:1 to get the concentrations of 70, 70, and 38 mM,
respectively. Then, the solution was transferred into a Teflon-lined
stainless steel autoclave, and the activated CFs were immersed into
the mixed solution. Subsequently, the autoclave was sealed and maintained
at 180 °C for 24 h. The resulting CoNi-LDH@CFs were washed alternately
with deionized water and ethanol several times and dried at 80 °C
overnight.

4.3 Preparation of CoNi2S4 Arrays
CoNi2S4 was prepared via an
in situ vulcanization treatment of the CoNi-LDH precursor. In a typical
procedure, one wisp of the CoNi-LDH@CFs nanoplatelet array was placed
into a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave with 0.02 M solution
of Na2S·9H2O (60 mL) and then heated at
160 °C for 2 h. After the hydrothermal reaction, the obtained
CoNi2S4 array was rinsed thoroughly and dried
in 60 °C. Vulcanization with different spans followed the same
steps. Except for the discussion part on the vulcanization time, the
CoNi2S4 samples for other characterizations
were obtained by vulcanization for 2 h.

4.4 Assembly
of the All-Solid-State Asymmetric
Supercapacitor
CoNi2S4@CFs and active
carbon (AC)@CFs were used as the positive and negative electrodes,
respectively. The PVA/KOH used for the solid electrolyte was prepared
as follows: KOH was added into 60 mL of deionized water to get the
concentration of 1 M and then 6 g of PVA powder was added into this
solution. The whole mixture was heated to 90 °C under stirring
until the solution became clear. The AC@CFs electrode was obtained
by repeated dipping of the CFs into a mixture slurry of AC, polyvinylidene
fluoride, and acetylene black with a mass ratio of 8:1:1 several times.
After drying in an oven at 60 °C, the AC@CFs electrode was obtained.
Then, several roots of CoNi2S4@CFs and AC@CFs
were dipped separately into the PVA/KOH gel electrolyte for 3 min.
Finally, the two individual electrodes were taken out, dried at 60
°C in vacuum, and then bonded to make the area fully contacted.
Thus, the CoNi2S4@CFs//AC@CFs asymmetric all-solid-state
hybrid microcapacitor was obtained.

4.5 Characterization
XRD patterns were
recorded by a Rigaku XRD-6000 diffractometer, using Cu Kα radiation
(0.15418 nm) at 40 kV, 30 mA. A Zeiss SUPRA 55 SEM and a JEOL JEM-3010
TEM were used for morphological observation. HR-TEM was collected
on an FEI Tecnai G2 F20 S-Twin (200 kV). Al Kα radiation used
in XPS measurements were conducted on an ESCALAB 250 instrument (Thermo
Electron). Nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherms were measured
on a Quantachrome Autosorb-1CVP analyzer. The specific surface area
was calculated using the BET method. All electrochemical measurements
were carried on a CHI 660E electrochemical workstation (Shanghai Chenhua
Instrument Co., China). The electrochemical tests on the CoNi2S4@CFs electrode were performed in a three-electrode
system by using a saturated Hg/HgCl2 (SCE) electrode and
a platinum plate as the reference and counter electrode, respectively,
in 3 M KOH aqueous solution. At the open-circuit voltage, an alternating
current voltage with 5 mV amplitude was employed in the EIS measurement,
while the frequency ranged from 0.01 to 100 kHz in 1.0 M KOH solution.
The electrochemical performance of CoNi2S4@CFs//AC@CF
all-solid-state devices was measured in a two-electrode system.
