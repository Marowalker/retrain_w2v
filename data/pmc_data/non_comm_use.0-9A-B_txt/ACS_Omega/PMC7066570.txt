Tetrazolium violet
(TZV) is an important pharmaceutical intermediate
for the preparation of various medicines, taking into account microbiological
studies and TZV as a new inhibitor of heterocyclic compound. The corrosion
inhibiting action of TZV for copper in 0.5 M H2SO4 solutions was assessed by potentiodynamic polarization and electrochemical
impedance spectroscopy. The corroded copper surfaces were evaluated
by scanning electron microscopy. Thereafter, the thermodynamics of
TZV adsorption onto copper was computed and evaluated. As a result,
the target TZV compound shows great corrosion inhibition performance
to protect copper in sulfuric acid. Thermodynamic test results reveal
that the Langmuir, Dhar–Flory–Huggins, and Bockris–Swinkels
isotherm models provide a better description for the adsorption process
of TZV on the metal surface. The calculated values of ΔGads0 indicate a spontaneous adsorption process of TZV on the copper surface
accompanied by two kinds of interactions, physical adsorption and
chemisorption.

1 Introduction
Copper has excellent mechanical
applications and is widely used
in a series of industrial processes such as acid washing and industrial
purification and helps to interconnect the micropores of 3D packaging.1−11 For electrodeposition, the Cu surfaces must be clean and free from
oil, grease, and heavy oxides, and it should be pointed out that copper
is susceptible to a more rapid attack in acidic solution.12−14 However, the addition of corrosion inhibitors (some organic compounds)
can substantially reduce the metal losses during pickling.15−18 Unfortunately, the majority of the current-inhibiting components
were applied to preserve copper from acid solution, which improves
the quality of pickling in the industry,19−22 and the disadvantages of BTA
and its derivatives are its toxicity and bad water solubility.23 Therefore, exploiting the high-efficiency and
nontoxic inhibitors for copper corrosion in acid solutions is of great
importance. Tetrazolium violet (TZV) having an electron-withdrawing
chemical group, such as nitroblue tetrazolium, has been shown to bind
its electrons using its positive tetrazole ring.24 TZV is an important pharmaceutical intermediate for the
preparation of various medicines. High concentrations of TZV can conduce
to total inhibition of bacterial growth and TZV have been widely used
for microbiological studies.25 The structure
of the TZV molecule is shown in Figure 1. No reports have been found about TZV act as an inhibitor
for metal in acidic solutions. Therefore, this article is to study
the action of the TZV inhibitors to delay the corrosion of copper
in acidic solutions. The inhibitory effect of TZV was observed by
electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), scanning electron microscopy
(SEM), and potentiodynamic polarization.

the studied compound of TZV.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Polarization Curves
To reveal the
effects of inhibitor concentration and corrosion mechanism, Figure 2 demonstrates the
polarization curves of copper in sulfuric acid solution for different
TZV concentrations and test temperatures. The anode and cathode current–potential
curves are extrapolated and intersected based on the corrosion data
of current density (Icorr) and potential
(Ecorr).26 The
corrosion parameter of Tafel was observed and calculated from the
software of CHI760E, in the study temperature range of some corrosion
data such as Ecorr, Icorr, cathode, and anode Tafel slopes (βc, βa) at different testing temperatures (288–318
K), which are listed in Table 1. The efficiency of the inhibitor was obtained by eq 1.27,28 1  where Icorr and Icorr(inh) represent the corrosion
current density
in the absence and presence of various concentrations of TZV in 0.5
M H2SO4 solution, respectively.

According
to Figure 2 and Table 1, when
the TZV inhibitor was added to the solution, the cathode and anode
reactions of the copper corrosion were deferred, and the inhibitor
efficiency was increased to a maximum of 95.1% at 3.2 × 10–4 M and 298 K, and the inhibition efficiency reveals
that the high concentration of TZV had a good inhibitory effect. The
slopes of the cathode Tafel line and the anode Tafel line (βc and βa) were recognized to shift after adding
inhibitors into the solution, indicating the effect of TZV on the
cathode and anode reactions, but the anode reaction is more sensitive
to TZV. As shown in Figure 2, the cathodic current density decreases after adding TZV
into solution, and in anodic domain, the curves drift apparently toward
the direction of the current density decreases with the addition of
TZV. The results of experiments show that increasing the concentration
of the inhibitor can decrease the current density correspondingly
because of the adsorption of the inhibitor on the copper surface.29

In addition, a major factor that affects
the corrosive performance
of components in solutions is temperature. In this experiment, the
polarization parameters of copper corrosion obtained from polarization
curves at different temperatures (288–318 K) are shown in Table 1, and the value of Icorr increases as the temperature of the corrosive
medium increases within the temperature range of 288–318 K.
However, Icorr has almost no change in
the relatively high concentration of TZV within the studied temperature
scope (288–318 K). It can also be noticed that the corrosion
potential transitions to a further negative value in the presence
of TZV confirmed that the oxygen cathode reduction reaction is more
sensitive to the presence of inhibitors.30

According to Riggs’s theory and others,31 an anode- or cathode-type inhibitor can be defined
as a
potential sharp fluctuation exceeding 85 mV between acid solutions
containing inhibitor and blank solution. Figure 3 demonstrates the OCP curves of copper metal
in 0.5 M sulfuric acid for different TZV concentrations and temperatures.
As can be seen from Figure 3, compared with the pure acidic solutions, the displacement
of the open-circuit potential of the solution containing TZV is less
than 60 mV. Therefore, the TZV compound was demonstrated to be a mixed-type
inhibitor.

in 0.5 M H2SO4 solution with different TZV concentrations
at different temperatures: (a) 288, (b) 298, (c) 308, and (d) 318
K.

2.2 Electrochemical
Impedance Spectroscopy
The EIS spectra of copper in acidic
solutions with different concentrations
of TZV at a distinct temperature range from 288 to 318 K are shown
in Figure 4. The addition
of TZV leads to a change in the impedance map of shape and size. It
can be seen from the Figure 4 that a single semicircular capacitor ring in the higher-frequency
range constitutes some impedance spectrum, and then a Warburg impedance
occurs at a low-frequency range as the temperature of the corrosive
medium increases within the temperature range of 298–318 K.
In general, a high-frequency capacitor loop is similar to a Faraday
process, which includes a double-layer capacitive component and a
charge-transfer resistor in parallel.32 It can be recognized that the hydrogen discharge current density
is much lower than the copper reduction current density at the cathode
region.33 The existence of Warburg impedance
due to corrosive ion motion at the metal/liquid interface and diffusion
of oxygen through the sulfuric acid adhere to the copper surface.34,35 In other words, the Warburg impedance appeared in the impedance
spectra demonstrates that the corrosive mechanism of copper in sulfuric
acid is dominated by both charge-transfer process and diffusion process.
It is believed that the concentration polarization does not participate
in the anodic dissolution of copper in H2SO4 solution.36 As can be seen from Figure 4, the diameter of
capacitive curves increased apparently with the increase of the concentration
of inhibitor, which represents a superior inhibition performance of
TZV because of its excellent adsorption ability on copper. The impedance
spectrum shows the concave semicircle of the capacitor ring, and the
arc center can be found beneath the horizontal coordinates. The aberration
of the ring of the depression from the perfect semicircular shape
may be explained by the minuscule roughness of the metal surface and
the unevenness of the electrode surface caused by the adsorption of
the inhibitor. It can be identified as the frequency dispersion of
the interface impedance.37−40Figure 4 shows several raised arcs and each radius of curvature of the capacitor
ring decreased with increases in the temperature of the corrosive
medium. This indicates a certain decrease in the impedance value and
a certain degree of accelerated corrosion because the corrosive ion
exercises more and more and quickly on the copper surface.41,42

Figure 4 Nyquist
plots for copper in 0.5 M H2SO4 with
various concentrations of TZV: (a) 288, (b) 298, (c) 308, and (d)
318 K.

The EIS diagrams were interpreted
by using the equivalent circuits
[(R(QR)), Figure 5a; R(Q(R(Q(RW)))), Figure 5b] with ZSimpWin software and
are given in Table 2. The impedance spectra without Warburg impedance were analyzed using
the standard Randles’ circuit model. As can be seen from Figure 5, the impedance spectrum
shows the concave semicircle of the capacitor ring, and the experimental
arc center can be found beneath the horizontal coordinates. However,
other Nyquist diagram shows a depressed capacitor loop in the high
frequency, and the Warburg impedance in the low frequency was fitted
by the circuit shown in Figure 5b. Taking Figure 6 as an example, the fitting and initial parameter values for
copper in 0.5 M H2SO4 solution of 0, 1.0 ×
10–5, 3.2 × 10–5, 1.0 ×
10–4, and 3.2 × 10–4 M TZV
were analyzed. As can be seen from Figure 6a,b, a series of data counted by simulation
and experiments can be found a good fit. Based on the above-mentioned
equivalent circuit model, the measured charge-transfer resistance Rct, the solution resistances Rs and Rf stand for the resistance of the inhibitor
layer on copper metal surface, and Q1 and Q2 ascribe to the constant phase elements (CPE).
The CPE and Warburg impedance W were recorded in Table 2. The χ2 values represented that the equivalent analog circuit (R(Q(R(Q(RW))))) was reasonable. The relationship between
inhibition efficiency and charge-transfer resistance was constructed
by the following formula43 2  where Rct0 is the charge-transfer resistance
in 0.5 M sulfuric acid and Rct is the
charge-transfer resistance in 0.5 M sulfuric acid with TZV of different
concentrations, respectively.

Analyses of the impedance function of CPE are commonly
employed
to measure the nonideal capacitive behavior and its frequency dependence.
It is usually calculated using the following formula 3  where Y is the CPE amplitude,
ω represents the angular frequency (2πf), and deviation exponent n reflects the microscopic
fluctuation of the surface, which is a valuable standard for the surface
properties of the metal.44 Consider a circuit
with CPE in which the double-layer capacitance value (Cdl) can be mathematically expressed as45 4  

After the addition of organic molecules of TZV, the value of Cdl is always reduced, possibly that the water
molecules adsorbed at the copper/solution interface were partially
replaced by the inhibitor. It can be seen that the deviation parameter n decreases marginally with the increase of the inhibitor
concentration. The change in surface roughness caused by the increase
of the concentration of the inhibitor caused a change in the value
of n.46

The diffused
resistances were determined by the Warburg impedance
and expressed as 5  

In general, Yw0 represents a number of Ω cm2 to the electrical admittance. Through analyses and comparisons
of
different equivalent circuit and fitting impedance curves, parameters
which may represent the behaviors of corrosion inhibition were obtained,
as shown in Table 2. The test data for Rct > W indicated that the electron-transfer activity of the copper
electrode
is higher than that of an oxygen diffusion transfer process in acid
electrolysis. As shown in Figure 4 and Table 2 that at the same temperature, as the inhibitor concentration
increases, the value Rct increases and
the value Cdl decreases. This phenomenon
results from the protective films in the metal surface that prevented
corrosive medium from attacking the copper surfaces, resulting in
an increase in the Rct value.47 The related electrochemical equivalent circuit
technique was used to determine the 0.5 M H2SO4 solution with 3.2 × 10–4 M TZV at 288, 298,
308, and 318 K calculated as 23 610, 19 560, 12 420,
and 6657 Ω cm2. The test data of IEZ % through eq 2 can reach 88.6, 98.3, 97.3, and 98.7 in the different temperatures,
respectively. In fact, the inhibition efficiency data were obtained
with EIS test and Tafel polarization of experiment, whose trend is
very similar, but the corresponding values are quite different.

2.3 Adsorption Isotherms
The inhibition
and adsorption mechanism of the TZV inhibitors in metal surfaces could
be specified by the adsorption model, and the adsorption and thermodynamics
were analyzed by the Tafel and EIS experiment parameter; in other
words, the surface coverage (θ) values have been evaluated from
the inhibitive efficiency based on the average number of Tafel and
EIS, and the different concentrations of TZV were measured using appropriate
adsorption isotherms to explain the inhibition mechanism within the
temperature range of 288–318 K. The adsorption of inhibitor
molecules was replaced by water molecules at the copper/solution interface
for substitution adsorption process. Refer to the following formula18 6  

Orgsol symbol stands for
the organic inhibitor molecules in the solution and Orgads for adsorbed molecules on the copper surface. The symbol of X stands for that the numbers of water molecules are replaced
by an organic inhibitor molecule. To get the most fitting isotherms
for θ, the following formula is usually used.

The adsorption
isotherm equations of Langmuir 7  

The equation of Flory–Huggins48 8  

The equation of Dhar–Flory–Huggins49 9  

The equation of Frumkin isotherm50 10  

The equation
of Bockris–Swinkels50 11  

The equation of Temkin isotherm51 12  

In the above
equation, C represents the concentration
of inhibitor, α represents the parameter of the molecular interaction
adsorbed on the copper surface, and K represents
the inhibitor adsorption equilibrium constant. According to the correlation
coefficient (R2), the most suitable fitting
isotherm equation was determined within the studied temperature range.
According to the correlation coefficient (R2), the most suitable fitting isotherm equation is determined. From
288 to 318 K, Dhar–Flory–Huggins (eq 9) and Bockris–Swinkels model isotherms
(eq 11) supply a more
intuitive overview of the adsorption of TZV on the copper surfaces.
We fitted the adsorption curve of TZV on the metal surface in H2SO4 solutions, as shown in Figure 7, which represents the relationship between
concentration solution and surface coverage. The fitting parameters
of R2, K, X, and so forth are listed in Figure 7. At the same temperature, the two isotherms of the
Bockris–Swinkels and Dhar–Flory–Huggins models
produce approximate results. The K values could be
calculated from the relation among the concentration of inhibitor
and the surface coverage using linear and nonlinear regression methods.
The free energy of inhibitor adsorption of ΔGads0can be
obtained from the following formula:52 13  

Figure 7 Adsorption isotherm for
copper in 0.5 M H2SO4 solution containing various
concentrations of TZV under the different
temperatures: (a) Langmuir isotherm model, (b) Dhar–Flory–Huggins
model, and (c) Bockris–Swinkels model.

The number 55.5 represents the molal concentration of a water solute.
The symbol T stands for the test temperature and R for the general gas constant. For the physical and chemistry
combined action of adsorption, the ΔGads0 value is usually
in the range of −40 to −20 kJ mol–1. The ΔGads0 value less than −40 kJ mol–1 may involve the process of chemisorption.53,54 As can be seen from Figure 7, the ΔGads0 in this study ranged from −36.2
to −41.6 kJ mol–1, indicating that the TZV
adsorption on the surface of copper was processed spontaneously, and
the adsorption of those adsorbents were the result of physical and
chemical adsorption within the temperature range studied (288–318
K). It can be seen from Figure 7 that the ΔGads0 will be more negative with the increase
of temperature, which indicates that higher temperature is helpful
for the absorptionat.44X = 2.0 for Dhar–Flory–Huggins isotherms model means
that a TZV molecule can replace about two water molecules on the copper
metal surface at 298 K. In accordance with Figure 7, the X value decreases
as the temperature of the corrosive solution increases. In theory,
the physical adsorption of molecule is only stable at low temperatures
owing to the low adsorption heat, while the chemical adsorption energy
is relatively high and more stable at high temperatures.55 This result may be due to small changes in the
properties of the adsorption model: physical adsorption plays a leading
role at the low-temperature range for the result of physical adsorption
and chemical adsorption, as the temperature increases, the chemical
adsorption gradually takes over the main position and coexisted with
physical adsorption in the high-temperature experiment for TZV on
the copper surface adsorptive behavior.

2.4 SEM Analyses
Figure 8 shows an
SEM image of copper exposed to
a 0.5 M H2SO4 solution after immersing with
and without 3.2 × 10–4 M TZV for 8 h at 308
K. The SEM morphology of copper before immersion in corrosive solution
showed a freshly polished metal surface (Figure 8a). As shown in Figure 8b, the surface of copper without TZV was
severely corroded and some corrosion pitting appears. The SEM images
of copper specimens after immersing in acid with 3.2 × 10–4 M TZV are shown in Figure 8c, the rate of corrosion was suppressed,
and the corrosion pitting was significantly reduced. Despite these superficial resemblances for cracks and holes appears whether
the freshly polished copper surface or the morphology of copper immersed
in 0.5 M H2SO4 solution. Comparing the two illustrations
in Figure 8b,c, it
can be concluded that Figure 8c shows smoother surface with the TZV-inhibited Cu corrosion.

3 Conclusions
TZV
has been proven as an efficient inhibitor for the corrosion
of Cu in 0.5 M H2SO4 solution. Under the same
temperature conditions, the inhibition efficiency increases with the
concentration of TZV. The charge transfer resistance decreases as
the temperature increases. At the maximum inhibitor concentration
of 3.2 × 10–4 M, the results of EIS measurements
show that the inhibition efficiencies were 88.6, 98.3, 97.3, and 98.7%
at 288, 298, 308, and 318 K, respectively. It is known from the OCP
curve that TZV is a mixed inhibitor. All measurements showed that
the inhibitor of TZV had excellent inhibition effect for copper within
the studied temperature scope. The TZV adsorption on the copper surface
follows the Langmuir isotherm, the isotherm adsorption curves of Bockris–Swinkels
and Dhar–Flory–Huggins. The fitting results of Bockris–Swinkels
and Dhar–Flory–Huggins models indicate that at 288 K,
TZV molecules can replace about two water molecules. The inhibition
adsorption process of TZV was spontaneous and includes two types of
adsorptions, physisorption and chemisorption.

4 Materials
and Methods
4.1 Materials
The 0.5 M H2SO4 solutions were prepared by diluting the analytical
grade sulfuric acid with doubly distilled water. The concentration
of the TZV inhibitor ranged from 1 × 10–5 to
3.2 × 10–4 M in the solutions of 0.5 M H2SO4. In addition, the solution containing no TZV
inhibitor was used as a blank for comparison. TZV was purchased from
Shanghai Yuanye Bio-Technology Co., Ltd.

4.2 Electrochemical
Measurements
Measurements
were performed through the CHI 760E electrochemical workstation with
a standard three-electrode glass cell, and a pure copper wire (99.999%)
was cut into 1 cm in diameter as the working electrode. The reference
electrode with the saturated state of mercurous sulfate (SSE) and
corrosive solution can be easily connected by Luggin capillary. A
1.0 cm × 2.0 cm of platinum sheet was placed pointed right at
the working electrode to ensure that a sufficient isoelectric point
was generated. The cell was placed in an atmospheric environment and
measurements were taken under various temperatures (288–318
K) with a water bath. All the tests were conducted at desired temperatures
with an aqueous thermostat. According to SSE, we obtained all the
potentials reported. Before electrochemical measurements, the working
electrode was grounded with a sandpaper of 1000–2000 grit and
then ultrasonically treated in ethyl alcohol, and the organic residue
was removed in distilled water finally. The treated working electrode
was bathed in an electrolyte solution. Before EIS measurement, steady-state
open-circuit potential was recorded in acid solutions installed with
a thermostat water bath to control temperature accurately. The EIS
experiment was carried out by setting the frequency range from 0.01
Hz to 100 kHz at the open-circuit potential. The amplitude of the
sinusoidal potential disturbance was 5 mV. More accurate corrosion
curves of the anode and cathode current–potential were obtained
for some concreted potential range between 250 and 250 mV (SSE) relative
to OCP with 1 mV/s potential scan rate by using a Tafel polarization
method.

4.3 SEM Analyses
The pure copper sample
used for SEM experiments was cut into a rectangular parallelepiped
with a size of 2.0 cm × 1.0 cm × 1.0 cm. The samples were
placed in stable solutions of 0.5 M H2SO4 with
and without 3.2 × 10–4 M TZV. The copper samples
were taken out after marinating 8 h and dried after being washed by
deionized water and absolute alcohol successively. SEM pictures were
obtained using a Hitachi SU3500 SEM instrument under high vacuum at
15 keV.
