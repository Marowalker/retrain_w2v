Whether
short-term or long-term, overexposure to an abnormal amount
of copper ion does significant harm to human health. Considering its
nonbiodegradability, it is critical to sensitively detect copper ion.
Herein, a novel fluorescent strategy with a “turn-on”
signal was developed for highly sensitive and specific detection of
copper ion (Cu2+). In the present investigation, we found
that Cu2+ exhibits excellent peroxidase-like catalytic
activity toward oxidizing the nonfluorescent substrate of Amplex Red
into the product of resofurin with outstanding fluorescence emission
under the aid of H2O2. Thus, an enzyme-free
and label-free sensing system was constructed for copper ion detection
with quite simple operation. To ensure the detection sensitivity and
reproducibility, the amount of H2O2 and incubation
time were optimized. The limit of detection can reach as low as 1.0
nM. In addition, the developed assay demonstrated excellent specificity
and could be utilized to detect copper ion in water samples including
tap water and bottled purified water without standing recovery.

==== Body
1 Introduction
As an essential element,
copper ion (Cu2+) plays critical
roles for life. It can help to generate red blood cells and act as
neurotransmitters for physiological functions and also as a cofactor
of various enzymes including cytochrome oxidase, superoxide dismutase,
and ferroxidases.1−3 However, an abnormal amount of copper ion has significant
negative effects on human health.4 Excessive
doses of Cu2+ can cause neurodegenerative diseases, such
as Alzheimer’s disease,5,6 Parkinson’s disease,7,8 and Menkes9,10 and Wilson disease.9,11 It is also believed that excessive Cu2+ can lead to gastrointestinal
disturbance and liver or kidney damage.12 Copper ion widely exists in the environment and may be finally accumulated
in the human body via food chains. Because it is nonbiodegradable
and remains in the ecological system indefinitely, it is important
and necessary to develop an accurate and sensitive strategy to monitor
copper ion for human health.

Traditional methods for detecting
copper ion are based on graphite
flame atomic absorption spectrometry,13,14 surface plasmon
resonance sensor,15 inductively coupled
mass atomic emission spectrometry,16 inductively
coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy,17,18 plasmon-resonance Rayleigh scattering spectroscopy19 and so on. These methods exhibit considerable sensitivity
while suffering limitations that the detection processes are rather
complicated and require costly instruments and highly trained personnel.
In recent years, fluorescent sensors have attracted ever-growing attention
because of their advantages: nondestructive, cost-effective, and sensitive
detection. It is worth noting that a few copper ion sensors are based
on signal “turn-on” response20−23 and most of the developed fluorescent
sensors for copper ion detection are signal “turn-off”
response, which usually presents a high background signal.24−29 Meanwhile, some developed sensing systems could be used to simultaneously
detect copper ion and multiple metal ions such as Fe3+,
Hg2+, Zn2+, Cd2+, Cr6+, or Mn2+.30−35 On the point of specific detection, the detection of copper ion
might suffer from interference from other metal ions. In the present
work, we aimed to develop a signal “turn-on” sensor
for highly sensitive, selective, and cost-effective detection of copper
ion with simple operation.

Nonfluorescent Amplex Red (AR) can
be oxidized into fluorescent
substrate resorufin, which is widely used as a fluorogenic substrate
to engineer fluorescence sensors for monitoring different targets.36,37 The AR oxidation in known assay systems relies on the coexistence
of hydrogen peroxide and horseradish peroxide (HRP).38 The use of enzyme greatly limits its further application
due to high cost, high requirement for preservation, and easy denaturation
of the enzymes. Researchers explored to replace HRP with diverse peroxidase-like
materials such as nanomaterials and G-quadruplex combining hemin.39−41 In the present investigation, we found that Cu2+ could
directly catalyze the oxidation of AR in the present of H2O2. According to the property, a “turn-on”
fluorescence sensor for Cu2+ detection was developed with
quite simple operation. The developed sensing system also presents
excellent selectivity and has no obvious response on other metal ions,
which could assay Cu2+ in drinking water with good recovery.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Sensing Principle for Cu2+ Detection
In the present investigation, it was
found for the first time that
a nonfluorescent substrate of AR can be oxidized into a fluorescent
substrate of resorufin by copper ion under the assistance of H2O2 as illustrated in Scheme 1. That is, the fluorescence response of the
AR/H2O2 was activated in addition to that of
Cu2+. By contrast, the phenomenon was not monitored in
a Cu2+ ion-free system. Therefore, the sensing system presented
excellent specificity for Cu2+ ion without being affected
by other metal ions (Cr3+, Zn2+, Ca2+, Mg2+, Cd2+, Pb2+, Fe3+, and Hg2+).

Scheme 1 Principle Scheme of the Developed Cu2+ Detection Strategy
According to the property, a signal “turn-on”
strategy
was constructed for highly sensitive and selective detection of copper
ion. Ultraviolet absorption experiments were conducted to validate
the oxidation reaction of AR, Figure 1A. No absorbance spectrum was monitored in solutions
containing only AR alone (a), both of AR and H2O2 (AR/H2O2) (b) or both of AR and Cu2+ (c). However, a significant absorption response was measured once
Cu2+ was added into AR/H2O2 solution
(d), which was the same as that of resorufin (e). The results are
consistent with the previous report by Haugland’s group.38 They confirmed that AR can be oxidized as resorufin
under synergic action of HRP and H2O2. Therefore,
it was reasonable to deduce that Cu2+ can replace HRP to
catalyze the oxidation of AR into resorufin. The feasibility of the
proposed strategy was further investigated by directly monitoring
the fluorescent response of the sensing system. As shown in Figure 1B, no obvious fluorescent
response was detected in solution containing only AR (a). The addition
of Cu2+ did not cause any obvious change (b). A slight
fluorescence enhancement could be monitored in the coexistence of
AR and H2O2 (c). Interestingly, the addition
of Cu2+ into AR/H2O2 solution resulted
in a significant fluorescence response (d). The results indicate that
Cu2+ could convert nonfluorescent AR into fluorescent resorufin
in the presence of H2O2 which was consistent
with the ultraviolet absorption results. It was expected that the
fluorescent response of the sensing system would be related to the
concentration of Cu2+. Thus, a novel, enzyme-free, label-free,
and cost-effective assay for Cu2+ detection with simple
operation could be realized with the mixture of AR/H2O2 as a sensing system which can function as “detection
kit”. To ensure detection sensitivity, the optimization of
the experimental conditions was investigated, including H2O2 concentration and incubation time of the system.

Cu2+ (c), 10 μM AR + 8.0 mM H2O2 + 1.0 μM Cu2+ (d). The adsorption spectrum of resorufin
(8.0 μM) (e) is almost the same as that of the oxidized product
of AR (d). (B) Fluorescence spectra of 0.1 μM AR (a); 0.1 μM
AR + 0.5 μM Cu2+ (b); 0.1 μM AR + 8.0 mM H2O2 (c); 0.1 μM AR + 0.5 μM Cu2+ + 8.0 mM H2O2 in Tris-HCl (25 mM, pH = 7.4)
(d).

2.2 Optimization
of H2O2 Concentration
According to
the results presented above
(Figure 1B,c), it was
found that H2O2 could slightly enhance the fluorescence
response of AR. Noteworthy, if the concentration of H2O2 is high enough, it would cause a high background signal that
would interfere in the detection. If the concentration of H2O2 is too low, however, it requires a larger amount of
Cu2+ to generate an obvious fluorescence change of the
sensing system, which would reduce the detection sensitivity. To ensure
the detection is as sensitive as possible, the concentration of H2O2 was then optimized in the presence of Cu2+ and AR at room temperature. As illustrated in Figure 2A, the fluorescence response
of the solution was significantly increased and reached a maximum
with increasing concentration of H2O2 to 8 mM.
This could be clearly seen by plotting fluorescent intensity at 583
nm against concentration of H2O2, Figure 2B. With further increasing
amount of H2O2, the fluorescence intensity was
gradually reduced. The reason might be that the oxidation product
of AR, resorufin, could be further oxidized into a colorless and nonfluorescent
substrate.38Thus, 8 mM was chosen as the
optimal concentration H2O2 in this experiment.

concentrations (0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 20, and 40 mM) from curve a
to curve i in Tris-HCl buffer solution (25 mM pH = 7.4). Error bars
were obtained according to three independent experimental results.

2.3 Optimization
of the Incubation Time
In the investigation, it was found
that the oxidation of AR catalyzed
by the coexistence of H2O2 and Cu2+ was related with the incubation time. To enhance the sensitivity
and reproducibility, the fluorescence responses of AR/H2O2 sensing system catalyzed by Cu2+ were investigated
after incubating different time intervals. To learn the signal change
caused by the added copper ion, the fluorescence responses of AR/H2O2 with incubation time were measured as control
experiments. In the absence of Cu2+, a slight fluorescence
change of AR/H2O2 solution was monitored with
increasing incubation time, Figure 3A. After adding Cu2+, the fluorescence response
of AR/H2O2 was increased with different time
intervals, Figure 3B. The relative fluorescence change, (F – F0)/F0, as a function
of incubation time was plotted to help find the optimum reaction time, Figure 3C. Herein, F0 and F represent the fluorescent
intensity of the AR/H2O2 solution at 583 nm
in the absence and presence of Cu2+ after incubating the
same period, respectively. The result exhibits that the ratio of (F – F0)/F0 increases to a plateau after incubating 7 h and then
gradually decreases after incubating 10 h. Thus, 7 h was selected
as the optimal incubation time and used for the following experiments.

against different incubation time, F and F0 are the fluorescence intensities at 583 nm
in the presence and absence of Cu2+ after incubating the
same period, respectively. Error bars were obtained from three independent
experimental results.

2.4 Sensitive Detection of Cu2+ in
Buffer Solution
According to the above optimized experiment
conditions, the developed sensing system for high sensitive detection
of Cu2+ was explored. Figure 4A depicts the relationship between fluorescence
responses of the “detection kit”, AR/H2O2, and copper ion within certain concentration range. The fluorescence
response gradually increases with increasing copper ion. To evaluate
the reproducibility of the “detection kit”, error bars
were calculated by plotting the degree of fluorescence intensity change
(F – F0)/(Fmax – F0)
against the concentration of copper ion, Figure 4B, where F and F0 represent fluorescence intensities at 583 nm in the
presence and absence of Cu2+, respectively. Fmax is the fluorescence intensity at 583 nm caused by
the copper ion with its maximum detection concentration. A good linear
relationship was found over the concentration range from 1.0 nM to
100 nM (R2 = 0.996). The error bars distributed
within a very narrow range, indicating the excellent reproducibility
of the provided assay. Limit of detection (LOD) reached as low as
1.0 nM by practical measurement rather than the conventional calculation
of three times the ratio of signal-to-noise, confirming the high sensitivity.
The LOD is comparable to that in recent reports about copper ion detection.
Huang’s group constructed a “click chemistry”
fluorescent sensor based on an intramolecular G-quadruplex formed
by DNA-templated click reaction in the presence of Cu2+, which reported a LOD of 65 nM for Cu2+ detection.42 Zhang’s group developed a ratiometric
fluorescent method for semiquantitative assay to detect Cu2+ down to 8.82 nM.43 On the basis of the
specific interaction between Cu2+ and Cu2+-dependent
DNAzyme/substrate complex, a fluorephore-labeled fluorescent biosensor
was provided, which could detect aqueous Cu2+ down to 0.6
nM.44 As compared with that in previous
reports,45−47 the assay developed by us is cost-effective, label-free,
and enzyme-free. Meanwhile, the detection procedure is quite simple.

Cu2+ detection. (A) Fluorescence responses of the sensing
system in the presence of Cu2+ with different concentration

intensities of the sensing system at 583 nm with the increase of Cu2+ concentration. The error bars were obtained from three independent
experimental results.

2.5 Specific Detection of Cu2+
To evaluate the specificity of the as-prepared “detection
kit”, the effect of other metal ions on the sensing system
was tested with Cr3+, Zn2+, Ca2+,
Mg2+, Cd2+, Pb2+, Fe3+, and Hg2+. The experiments were conducted according to
the same experimental procedure as Cu2+ detection. As shown
in Figure 5, the fluorescence
change of the sensing system caused by Cu2+ was significantly
greater than that of the other metal ions, indicating that the sensing
system responds specifically toward Cu2+. In recent reports,
several groups developed fluorescent sensors with signal “turn-on”
for Cu2+ detection. However, the Cu2+ detection
was influenced by ions such as Hg2+, Fe3+, and
Zn2+.30−34 In our investigation, the detection principle was based on the intrinsic
catalytic property of Cu2+, which helps to eliminate the
interference of other metal ions. It was noted that though Fe3+ has catalytic activity, it does not cause any fluorescence
change of the “detection kit” since Fe3+ usually
presents a catalytic property in acidic condition,48 while the Cu2+ determination in our investigation
was conducted in neutral buffer solution that inhibits the catalytic
property of Fe3+ and its interference correspondingly.
This also provides a novel assay for specifically detecting Cu2+ in biological environments.

sensing system for Cu2+ detection. The normalized fluorescence

obtained from three independent experimental results.

2.6 Determination Cu2+ in a Real Sample
To further investigate the potential application,
the provided
assay was utilized to detect Cu2+ in real samples including
tap water and bottled purified water without any pretreatment. A standard
addition method was adopted by adding Cu2+ into the water
samples to reach final concentrations of 20 nM, 50 nM, and 80 nM.
According to the experimental procedure described above, the recoveries
of the proposed method were found within a range from 97% to 120%
as illustrated in Table 1. The results validate the reliability of the developed assay for
Cu2+ determination in real water samples.

3 Conclusions
A novel enzyme-free and label-free strategy for Cu2+ detection with signal “turn-on” has been successfully
developed. In our investigation, it was found for the first time that
copper ion can catalyze nonfluorescent Amplex Red into fluorescent
resorufin in the presence of H2O2, which was
utilized to construct a sensing system for highly sensitive and specific
detection of copper ion. The limit of detection reached 1.0 nM. The
developed assay presents advantages as following. The detection procedure
is quite simple and does not need organic synthesis, enzymatic reaction,
chemical label, or sophisticated instrumentation. This greatly enhances
the reproducibility and is highly critical for in situ analysis. Moreover,
the provided assay is based on the intrinsic peroxidase-like activity
of Cu2+ to AR/H2O2, which greatly
eliminates the interference of other metal ions and presents outstanding
selectivity for copper ion detection. In a real water sample, copper
ion can be detected with excellent recovery. The provided approach
is expected to have great potential application in environmental and
food safety monitoring as well as in biological detection for human
health.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials
and Chemicals
Amplex Red
(AR) and resorufin were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO).
Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and cupric nitrate
(Cu (NO3)2) were obtained from Sinopharm Chemical
Reagent Co., Ltd. The other chemicals (Cr(NO3)3·9H2O, ZnSO4, (CH3COO)2Ca, (CH3COO)2Mg, CdCl2, Pb(NO3)2, FeCl3, Hg(NO3)2) were purchased from Aladdin (Shanghai, China). All the chemicals
were analytical reagent grade and used as received without further
purification. Ultrapure water used throughout was prepared by the
Milli-Q ultrapure water system (18.2 MΩ·cm–1, Millipore System Inc.)

4.2 Detection of Cu2+
Cu(NO3)2 and H2O2 aqueous solution
were freshly prepared before use. For each experiment, 20 μL
of AR solution, 20 μL of H2O2, and 20
μL of different copper concentrations were mixed. Tris-HCl buffer
solution (140 μL, 25 mM, pH = 7.4) was added to reach total
volume of 200 μL as the sensing system. The final concentrations
of AR and H2O2 were 0.1 μM AR and 8 mM,
respectively. The fluorescence of the sensing system was detected
after an incubation of 7 h. Fluorescence spectra were recorded from
570 to 650 nm under excitation at 540 nm at room temperature. Both
emission and excitation spectra were scanned with 10 nm slit size,
650 V voltage, and 50 ms integration time.

4.3 Determination
of Cu2+ in real sample
The real samples are daily
drinking water including tap water and
bottled purified water bought from the local supermarket. The samples
were not further treated and used as received. The concentration of
Cu2+ in a real sample was detected using the standard addition
method. The final concentrations of added copper ion in the water
sample were 20 nM, 50 nM, and 80 nM, respectively. The detection in
water samples follows the same experimental procedure described in section 4.2.

4.4 Instruments
Fluorescence spectra
were recorded with a LUMINA fluorescence spectrometer (Thermo, USA)
at room temperature. Absorbance measurements were performed on a Cary
500 Scan UV/vis/NIR spectrophotometer (Varian, USA).
