4-Androstene-3-17-dione (4A), also
known as androstenedione, is
the key intermediate of steroid metabolism. 5β-Androstane-3-17-dione
(5A) and (+)-6-methyl-5β-androstane-3-17-dione (6M) are the
steroid derivatives of androstenedione. The interactions of androstenedione
and its derivatives with plasma proteins are important in understanding
the distribution and bioavailability of these molecules. In our present
study, we have studied the binding affinity of androstenedione and
its derivatives with plasma proteins such as human serum albumin (HSA)
and α1-acid glycoprotein (AGP). Our results showed that the
4A, 5A, and 6M steroid molecules can form stable complexes with HSA
and AGP. The affinity of the studied steroid molecules with HSA is
high compared to that with AGP, and the binding constants obtained
for 4A, 5A, and 6M with HSA are 5.3 ± 2 × 104, 5.3 ± 1 × 104, and 9.5 ± 0.2 × 104 M–1, respectively. Further, binding sites
of these steroid molecules in HSA are identified using molecular displacement
and docking studies: it is found that 4A and 5A bind to domain III
while 6M binds to domain II of HSA. Furthermore, the circular dichroism
data revealed that there is a partial unfolding of the protein while
interacting with androstenedione and its derivatives. Also, molecular
dynamics simulations were carried out for HSA–androstenedione
and its derivative complexes to understand their stability; hence,
these results yielded that HSA–androstenedione and its derivative
complexes were stabilized after 15 ns and maintained their stable
structures.

1 Introduction
Plasma
proteins bind reversibly to drugs, hormones, and metabolites,
which are hydrophobic in nature and circulate in the bloodstream.
The binding affinity of plasma proteins determines free and effective
concentrations, thereby regulating the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics
of the drugs. Hence, understanding the interaction mechanisms of various
drugs and metabolites with these plasma proteins is of clinical significance.
The major carrier proteins in plasma include human serum albumin (HSA), α1-acid
glycoprotein (AGP), and lipoproteins.1 Among
the aforementioned plasma proteins, HSA is one of the most abundant
proteins in human plasma, and it acts as a carrier for most drugs.
Drugs that interact with HSA are acidic/neutral in nature, but they
are basic in the case of AGP.2

Steroids
get transported in the bloodstream with the aid of specific
transporter proteins. Even though specific carrier proteins are available
for the transport of steroids, they can also effectively interact
with HSA.3,4 Earlier reports on steroid hormones such
as testosterone and progesterone show that they can interact with
HSA.3,5 Natural variants of HSA such as Niigata
and Tagliacozzo show a high affinity toward prostaglandin and progesterone,
respectively.6 Besides HSA, another plasma
protein AGP, an acute protein, also interacts with steroids and their
derivatives. AGP can interact strongly with progesterone,7 and the binding site for the progesterone is
located in the N-terminus. Consequently, the binding site for progesterone
is near to carbohydrate residue, demonstrated by using calcofluor
white as a probe.8

4-Androstene-3-17-dione
(4A) is a naturally occurring steroidal
hormone, which is produced in gonads and adrenal glands, and is found
to be the key metabolic intermediate in the metabolism of steroids
such as testosterone, estradiol, progesterone, cortisone, and cortisol.9 Synthetically, this compound is also used as
a precursor molecule for the synthesis of various steroids. It possesses
both androgenic and anabolic properties,10 and thus, the level of 4A in blood plasma is significant. Also,
it is an immediate precursor for testosterone, and the enzyme 17-β-hydroxysteroid
dehydrogenase converts 4A to testosterone. Further, the enzyme aromatase
converts 4A to estrone and estradiol.11 In this line, we have synthesized 5β-androstane-3-17-dione
(5A) through an organocatalysis method by taking 4A as the starting
material.12 Physiologically, 4A gets converted
to 5A in the presence of 3-oxo-5-β-steroid-4-dehydrogenase.
Another derivative is (+)-6-methyl-5β-androstane-3-17-dione
(6M), in which the methyl group is attached at the C6 position of
5β-androstane-3-17-dione.

Structurally, HSA is a nonglycosylated
585-amino-acid polypeptide
chain, predominantly made up of α-helix (67%).13,14 It possess multidomain organization with three homologous domains,
domain I (1–195), II (196–383), and III (384–585),
forming a three-dimensional (3D) heart-shaped globular molecule. It
is a negatively charged protein and has 17 highly cross-linked disulfide
bonds.15,16 It contains a single tryptophan residue
at position 214. The protein mainly functions as a regulator of plasma
colloid oncotic pressure, and it also acts as a carrier for many exogenous
and endogenous metabolites and drugs.17 In addition to drug-carrying properties, this protein possesses
several other properties such as antioxidant and (pseudo)enzymatic
properties.18,19 It has a wide range of biochemical
properties and interactions with several kinds of molecules such as
fatty acids, porphyrins, bilirubin, thyroxin, and metal ions;20−24 hence, this protein can be exploited for various applications. There
are two major binding sites in HSA, site I and site II, located in
domain IIA and IIIA, respectively.25 Further,
domain IB is also named a drug-binding site.25 It has an important role as drugs/ligands compete for the same binding
site. Also, it is an allosteric protein and can accommodate more than
one molecule at a time. Thus, understanding of these complex mechanisms
of ligand interactions can help to understand the clinical outcome.

Perhaps, AGP also known as orosomucoid and acute phase protein
plays an important role in binding of drugs. It has a normal range
of 0.6–1.2 mg/mL (1–3% of plasma proteins);26 during inflammation, the plasma concentration
increases to 2–5 folds. Moreover, this protein has antiinflammatory
and immunomodulatory roles. Surprisingly, the levels of AGP elevated
in acute inflammation and show systemic response to local inflammation.27 It is a glycoprotein of 183 amino acid residues
with 41 kDa molecular weight, consists of 45% carbohydrate attached
in the form of N-linked glycans, and confines to the N-terminus of
the protein. This protein is negatively charged at physiological pH
because of 16 sialic acid residues.28 Also,
it has three tryptophan residues, where tryptophan 160 is present
on the surface of the protein and rest two are located at the inner
side of the protein.29 Predominantly, there
is only a single high-affinity basic drug-binding site in AGP.30 Recently, our group reported that there are
several molecules specifically bind to AGP.31,32 Competition for the single basic drug-binding site can control the
therapeutically effective plasma levels of basic drugs. Because of
the single binding site, the drugs binding to AGP can attain saturation
and are competitively displaceable. Stereo selectivity also exists
for the single binding site.

In the present study, we have aimed
to understand the following
observations such as interaction mechanism of HSA and AGP with the
synthesized steroid molecules, 4-androstene-3-17-dione (4A), 5β-androstane-3-17-dione
(5A), and (+)-6-methyl-5β-androstane-3-17-dione (6M) (Scheme 1). Further, the conformational
changes and stability of the complexes were emphasized using biophysical
and computational approaches.

Scheme 1 Structures of 4A, 5A, and 6M
The molecular weights of 4A,
5A, and 6M are 286.41, 288.42, and 302.45 Da, respectively.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Analysis
of Fluorescence Characteristics and
Quenching Mechanism
The phenomenon of fluorescence quenching
is an important method to characterize the interaction between a ligand
and biological macromolecules. In the present study, the interaction
of 4A, 5A, and 6M with HSA and AGP was characterized using fluorescence
emission spectra. The interaction time was optimized by monitoring
the fluorescence emission spectra of HSA and AGP at maximum concentrations
of the compounds at regular time periods and the interaction time
of 5 minutes was obtained. The emission spectra recorded for HSA and
AGP with increasing concentrations of the ligands are shown in Figures 1 and 2, respectively. In the presence of increasing concentrations
of 4A, 5A, and 6M, the intensity of fluorescence emission decreased
gradually with an insignificant shift toward shorter wavelengths.
However, there is no significant fluorescence emission from the ligands.
Hence, the quenching of the fluorescence is concentration-dependent.
Quenching can occur by a variety of molecular interactions such as
excited-state reactions, molecular rearrangements, energy transfer,
ground-state complex formation, and collisional quenching.33 Our group previously reported the interaction
of various phytochemicals with HSA based on the fluorescence quenching
phenomenon.34,35

Figure 1 Fluorescence emission spectra of HSA in
the presence of increasing
concentrations of (A) 4A, (B) 5A, and (C) 6M from 1 to 9 μM.
Fluorescence quenching was shown with increasing concentrations of
the molecules. There was no fluorescence emission for buffer and the
ligands in the given wavelength ranging from 300 to 500 nm. Modified
Stern–Volmer plots for (a) 4A, (b) 5A, and (c) 6M obtained
by plotting log [Q] values on the X-axis and log
[dF/F] values on the Y-axis. The slope of the plot gives the number of binding sites. The Y intercept value gives log K values, from
which the binding constant values were calculated. All three molecules
have only one binding site in HSA. The binding constant values are
5.3 ± 2 × 104, 5.3 ± 1 × 104, and 9.5 ± 0.2 × 104 M–1,
respectively, for 4A, 5A, and 6M.

Figure 2 Fluorescence emission spectra of AGP with increasing concentrations
of (A) 4A, (B) 5A, and (C) 6M. The emission maximum for AGP is 340
nm. Modified Stern–Volmer plots for (a) 4A, (b) 5A, and (c)
6M obtained by plotting log [Q] values on the X-axis
and log [dF/F] values on the Y-axis.

Usually, in protein,
aromatic amino acids such as tryptophan, tyrosine,
and phenylalanine act as intrinsic fluorophores.33 Among all three aromatic amino acids, tryptophan has much
stronger fluorescence intensity and higher quantum yield because of
its indole ring. Tyrosine also has a quantum yield similar to that
of tryptophan, but in native proteins, its fluorescence emission usually
gets quenched by tryptophan or if it is ionized. Further, phenylalanine
gives a very low quantum yield, and hence the intrinsic fluorescence
of a protein is the solely contribution from tryptophan residues.
Usually, microenvironment of the protein affects the emission spectra
of the tryptophan residues. The fluorescence emission maxima shift
toward shorter wavelength if the tryptophan residue is surrounded
by hydrophobic residues so that each and every protein shows its own
characteristic fluorescence emission spectra based on the number and
surrounding environment of the tryptophan residues. HSA has a single
tryptophan residue (Trp-214) located in the subdomain IIA corresponding
to the Sudlow’s drug-binding site I region. The characteristic
emission spectrum for HSA has emission maxima at 350 nm (Figure 1). In the case of
AGP, it has three tryptophan residues, its characteristic fluorescence
emission spectrum shows emission maxima at 340 nm, and the peak is
narrower compared to that of HSA (Figure 2). When small molecules are bound to HSA,
the changes of intrinsic fluorescence of HSA are induced by the microenvironment
of tryptophan residues. This indicates that the microenvironment around
tryptophan has been altered because of the formation of HSA–4A
(androstenedione), HSA–5A, and HSA–6M complexes.

Another important factor that could lead to a decrease in emission
intensity is the inner filter effect.36 The inner filter effect refers to the absorbance of light at the
excitation or emission wavelength by the ligands present in the solution.
The absorption and emission spectra of 4A, 5A, and 6M at 10 μM
concentration are given in Figure S1. The
emission intensities were corrected for the inner filter effect using
the following relationship:  where FCor is
the corrected fluorescence intensity, Aexi and Aemi represent the absorbance at
the fluorescence excitation (285 nm) and emission wavelengths, respectively,
and FObs is the observed fluorescence.

Two common mechanisms of quenching are well-known: dynamic (or)
collisional and static quenching,33 which
can be distinguished by temperature, viscosity dependence, and the
difference of their fluorescence lifetimes. The relation between the
quencher concentration and the fluorescence intensity can be well-explained
using the Stern–Volmer equation.  where F0 represents
the fluorescence intensity in the absence of quencher, F represents the fluorescence intensity in the presence of quencher,
[Q] is the quencher concentration, Kq is
the bimolecular quenching rate constant, τ0 is the
lifetime of the fluorophore in the absence of quencher and its value
is around 10–8 s for most of the biomolecules, and KSV is the Stern–Volmer quenching constant,
which can be written as  

The emission quenching data of HSA were plotted as F0/F against the concentration of ligands,
which is shown in Figure S2. It shows that
within the investigated concentrations, the Stern–Volmer plot
exhibited a good linear relationship. Further, the values of the Stern–Volmer
quenching constant KSV were obtained from
the slope, by keeping the intercept at 1. The average lifetime (τ0) of the biopolymer without any quencher has already been
reported as ∼10–8 s.37 From the above equation, bimolecular quenching rate constant was
calculated and was far greater than the maximum scatter collision
quenching constant 2.0 × 1010 M–1 s–1,38 showing the
formation of a ground-state complex between the protein and the ligands.
It has been well-established that for a static quenching process,
the quenching constant Kq should be greater
than the maximum scatter collision quenching constant. The calculated Kq values are 9.0 ± 0.2 × 1012, 9.8 ± 3 × 1012, and 1.0 ± 1.0 ×
1013 M–1 s–1, respectively,
for 4A, 5A, and 6M with HSA, which are greater than the maximum scatter
collision quenching constant. This identification shows that there
is a static ground-state complex formation between HSA and the ligands.
In a similar way, the interaction between AGP and the ligands was
also identified as the ground-state complex formation.

The binding
constants and the number of binding sites were calculated
using the modified Stern–Volmer equation.  where n corresponds to the
number of binding sites, K is the binding constant,
and [Q] is the quencher concentration.

log K can be calculated from the intercept of
the graph of log(F0 – F)/F versus log [Q], and the slope of the graph gives
the number of binding sites. The n values of 4A (0.818),
5A (0.911), and 6M (0.963) are nearer to 1, showing the one-to-one
interaction of the three molecules with HSA. The binding constants
were calculated, and they are 5.3 ± 2 × 104,
5.3 ± 1 × 104, and 9.5 ± 0.2 × 104 M–1, respectively, for 4A, 5A, and 6M (Figure 1). In a similar way,
the binding constants for 4A, 5A, and 6M with AGP were calculated
as 7.4 ± 4 × 103, 2.6 ± 0.6 × 103, and 2.1 ± 0.7 × 104 M–1, respectively (Figure 2). HSA is showing much higher affinity compared to AGP with these
three molecules; however, binding of these three compounds with AGP
is also significant. Compared to 4A and 5A, the methyl derivative
of androstane (6M) is showing higher affinity toward HSA and AGP.
These results indicate that both HSA and AGP play a major role in
binding which in turn act as major transporters in the blood system.

Because the binding constant (or) association constant value is
known, Kd can be calculated from the reciprocal
of K, and from that, binding free energies can be
calculated using the following equation:  where
ΔG0 is the free energy change, R is the gas constant
at room temperature, and Kd is the dissociation
constant which is given by  

The calculated free energies are −6.59, −6.51,
and
−6.83 kcal/mol, respectively, for 4A, 5A, and 6M with HSA,
whereas with AGP, the binding free energies are calculated as −5.18,
−4.64, and −5.85 kcal/mol, respectively, for 4A, 5A,
and 6M. These results are in agreement with those from our laboratory
work on different ligands binding with HSA and AGP.31,32,34,36 These data
infer that 4A (androstenedione), 5A, and 6M bind strongly with plasma
proteins. Binding of these molecules to AGP is of additional importance
because it also acts as a transporter in some disease conditions such
as renal failure, pregnancy, burns, and so forth. Differential binding
of these ligands is due to different functional groups attached to
the original molecules.

2.2 Locating the Binding Site
Using Site-Specific
Probes
Several attempts have been made to map the binding
sites on HSA, as it can bind to several exogenous and endogenous ligands.
Sudlow showed the presence of two specific drug-binding sites, namely,
site I (also called the warfarin binding site) and site II (the benzodiazepine
binding site) using a fluorescent probe displacement method.39 Even though there are two binding sites located
in subdomains IIA and IIIA, other secondary binding site is also located
at subdomain IB in HSA.25 Among the available
list of site-specific markers, we selected phenylbutazone and ibuprofen
as site probes for IIA and IIIA, respectively. An equimolar ratio
of HSA and site markers was titrated with 4A, 5A, and 6M in three
different experiments. The binding constant values were calculated
as mentioned above (Figure 3). The binding constant for 4A in the presence of ibuprofen
is 4.6 ± 0.1 × 104 M–1. Compared
to only HSA, the binding constant value is decreased in the presence
of site markers and is lower in the case of ibuprofen, showing that
the ligand is competing with ibuprofen to bind to IIIA. Similarly,
5A is also competes with ibuprofen; however, 6M is competing with
phenylbutazone, with binding constant values 4.0 ± 0.6 ×
104 and 3.5 ± 1 × 104 M–1, respectively. Figure 3 shows the fluorescence emission spectra of HSA in the presence of
ibuprofen and phenylbutazone while titrating with increasing concentrations
of 4A, 5A, and 6M. Thus, molecular displacement results in turn determined
the specific binding pockets of 4A, 5A, and 6M.

Figure 3 Competitive binding analysis
of (A) 4A, (B) 5A, and (C) 6M. 4A
and 5A are competing with ibuprofen toward binding to HSA. 6M is competing
with phenylbutazone. Modified Stern–Volmer plots for (a) 4A,
(b) 5A, and (c) 6M obtained by plotting log [Q] values on the X-axis and log [dF/F]
values on the Y-axis.

2.3 Secondary Structure Analysis from Circular
Dichroism Data
To understand the influence of ligand binding
on the conformation of secondary structure of HSA, circular dichroism
(CD) spectroscopy measurements were performed in the presence of increasing
concentrations of 4A, 5A, and 6M. The room-temperature CD spectra
measured in the presence of 4A, 5A, and 6M are shown in Figure 4. The characteristic CD spectra
of HSA measured in the far-UV region show two minima at 222 and 208
nm, which are the contributions of n → π* transfer of
the peptide bonds from α-helix.40−42 As shown in Figure 4, CD spectra of free
HSA exhibit two negative bands in the ultraviolet region at 208 and
222 nm. It was observed that in the presence of steroid molecules,
the CD signal of HSA got decreased. The decrease of the CD signal
indicates a decrease of helical secondary structure content. However,
the CD spectra of HSA in the presence or absence of ligands are similar
in shape, indicating that there are very minute changes occurred in
HSA due to ligand binding. Using CDNN software, the percentage of
secondary structures was quantified for both free HSA and HSA in the
presence of ligands. The percentage of α-helix differed from
66.05% in free HSA to 58.1% in 4A–HSA at pH 7.4 while β-turns
and random coils were increased from 17.43 to 20.1% and from 16.51
to 21.7%, respectively. In the cases of 5A and 6M, the α-helix
content was decreased to 59.1 and 53.6%, respectively. There is a
gradual decrease in the α-helical percentage with increasing
concentrations of ligands. The percentage changes of secondary structural
elements were plotted against the concentration of the ligands, which
is shown in the inset of Figure 4. The marginal changes in the percentage of secondary
structural elements indicate that 4A, 5A, and 6M are interacting with
HSA; hence, there is a partial unfolding of the protein. Structural
changes of the protein indicate the changes in the microenvironment
around the binding pocket residues upon binding of these molecules.
Similar results were observed from our laboratory work that upon binding
of ligands, HSA undergoes conformational changes.31,34,36 To understand the stability of HSA in various
temperatures, CD spectra were recorded for HSA with increasing temperature
from 25 to 85 °C. The temperature influence is not significant
up to 65 °C, consistent with the fact that HSA alone is stable
up to 65 °C (data not shown).

Figure 4 CD spectra of HSA alone (red line) and
with increasing concentrations
of (A) 4A, (B) 5A, and (C) 6M. The characteristic spectrum of protein
shows spectral minima at 208 and 222 nm, indicating that HSA is an
α-helical protein. The inset shows the percentage of secondary
structural elements of HSA, obtained by deconvoluting the CD spectra
using CDNN software.

2.4 Mode of Ligand Binding to HSA Using the Molecular
Docking Approach
Molecular docking studies were further used
to understand the interaction between HSA and the ligands.43 The 3D structure (taken from PDB ID: 1AO6) of HSA consists
of three homologous domains, denoted as I, II, and III. Each domain
contains six-helix and four-helix subdomains. Each domain further
subdivided into A and B subdomains that assemble to form a heart-shaped
tertiary structure.1 HSA has two major
drug-binding sites known as site I and II.39 Site I is a large, flexible region, has poor stereo selectivity,
and is located in subdomain IIA. The side chains of Tyr150, His242,
and Arg257 are located at the bottom of the pocket, and Lys195, Lys199,
Arg218, and Arg222 are located on an outer cluster at the pocket entrance.25 On the other hand, site II is a smaller or narrower
site than site I, shows stereo selectivity, and is located in subdomain
IIIA. Site II is a largely apolar cavity formed by Leu387, Ser489,
Leu453, and a single dominant polar patch at the pocket entrance,
having Tyr411 and Arg410.44

The docking
studies of HSA with 4A (androstenedione), 5A, and 6M give the information
about the binding site of these steroid molecules in HSA and the interacting
residues that form the binding groove (Figure 5). 4A binds in the groove formed by the residues
of domain III. The residues forming this groove are different from
those of site II. However, the groove is located immediately next
to site II, having some of the residues from site II. The electronegative
oxygen atom of 4A is forming a hydrogen bond with hydrogen from the
ε-amino group of Lys413, with a bond length of 2.79 Å.
Further, Thr540, Lys541, Glu542, Lys545, Leu529, Leu544, and Met548 from subdomain IIIB and Asn405,
Ala406, Val409, and Lys413 from subdomain IIIA are forming the binding
groove. Val409, Ala406, Leu544, and Lys545 are having hydrophobic
interactions, and the rest of the residues forming the binding groove
are interacting with van der Waals interactions, thereby holding 4A.
Also, 5A is interacting with the residues of domain III. However,
the binding groove is distinct from that of 4A. Further, the binding
site of 5A is also overlapping with site II. In this, Phe206, Arg209,
Ala210, Ala213, Leu331, Ala350, Lys351, Glu354, Leu347, Ser480, Leu481,
and Val482 are the amino acid residues that form a binding groove
for 5A. Moreover, Leu481 is forming a hydrogen bond with the electronegative
oxygen of 5A, and the bond length is 2.91 Å. Further, Ala210,
Arg209, Leu347, Val482, Ala213, and Lys351 are forming hydrophobic
interactions with 5A, and the rest are interacting with van der Waals
interactions. Distinct from 4A and 5A, 6M is interacting with the
residues of domain II. Hence, 6M is interacting with Leu203, Thr243,
Cys246, His247, Gln204, Gly207, Arg209, and Glu208 of subdomain IIA
of HSA. Additionally, Glu208 is forming a hydrogen bond with 6M, and
the bond length is 2.72 Å. From docking results, the binding
free energies were calculated to be −7.36, −6.42, and
−6.99 kcal/mol, respectively, for 4A, 5A, and 6M. These values
are nearer to the experimental values that are obtained from fluorescence
emission studies.

site with the interactions are shown in panels A, B, and C, respectively.

interacting with domain IIA of HSA.

2.5 Molecular Dynamics Simulation Studies
HSA–ligand complex formation, complex stability, and the effect
of ligands on HSA conformation with respect to time were analyzed
using molecular dynamics and simulation studies. The properties such
as root-mean-square deviation (rmsd) of HSA and complexes with respect
to their initial structures, root-mean-square fluctuations (RMSFs),
and radius of gyration (Rg) of the protein were obtained from molecular
dynamics simulation (MDS) analysis. For the MDS analysis, the best
conformer was taken from the docking studies for all of these molecules
(4A, 5A, and 6M).

The rmsd values of HSA, HSA–4A, HSA–5A,
and HSA–6M complexes with respect to their initial structure
were calculated along 100 ns trajectories in GROMACS. The rmsd data
show that HSA, HSA–4A, HSA–5A, and HSA–6M reach
equilibration after 15 ns and later after the complexes got stabilized
(Figure 6). Rg values
of free HSA and complexes are also shown in Figure 6. The initial Rg value of free HSA is 2.68
nm and got stabilized at 2.55 nm. Experimentally defined Rg value
of HSA using small-angle neutron scattering is 2.74 ± 0.035 nm,
nearer to the value obtained in the present study.34,45 There is not much difference in the Rg values of HSA–4A and
HSA–5A, with respect to that of HSA alone, up to 60 ns. After
60 ns, there is a decrease in the Rg value of HSA–4A. In the
case of HSA–6M complex, the Rg value increased slightly, with
respect to that of HSA alone, and the variation started from 5 ns.
Our experimental analysis with CD spectroscopy to understand the influence
of ligands on protein conformation also showed that there is a marginal
conformational change in the protein during 4A, 5A, and 6M binding
(Figure 4) and it is
high in the case of 6M. The CD data are further supporting the Rg
data.

Figure 6 (A) Time-dependent evolution of the Rg and (B) rmsd values for
free HSA, HSA–4A, HSA–5A, and HSA–6M complexes
during 100 ns MDS.

Local protein mobility
was analyzed by plotting the RMSFs of HSA
and the ligands against the atom number. Figure 7 shows the RMSF data of HSA and HSA–4A,
where the RMSF value of HSA is 0.21 nm with 0.09 nm standard deviation
and is 0.18 ± 0.09 nm for HSA–4A. Comparative RMSF in
the 4A binding region, that is, IIIB shows that the RMSF values of
HSA–4A are similar to those of HSA alone with little fluctuations,
showing the rigidity of the residues because of ligand binding. The
RMSF values of HSA–5A and HSA–6M are 0.17 ± 0.08
and 0.18 ± 0.08, respectively. The IIIA region and IIA region
of HSA show less RMSFs in the cases of 5A and 6M binding, respectively,
compared to HSA protein alone.

Figure 7 RMSFs of atoms of HSA in free HSA compared
to those of (A) HSA–4A,
(B) HSA–5A, and (c) HSA–6M complexes.

Further, the interactions of 4A, 5A, and 6M to
HSA were visualized
at every 3, 6, and 10 ns time point from the 100 ns MDS data to get
better insights into the complex stability. The snapshots for HSA–4A,
HSA–5A, and HSA–6M at 3 ns time intervals are shown
in Figure 8. Initially,
4A is interacting to Lys413 by a hydrogen bond (Figure 5), in time course, reoriented toward Asn405
in the binding groove itself, and form a hydrogen bond with Asn405.
From 3 ns time point, 4A is interacting with Asn405 by a hydrogen
bond, and this is stable up to 10 ns (Figure S3). The molecule is held by van der Waals interactions and hydrophobic
interactions given by the binding site residues (Figures 5, 8, and S3). In a similar way, the stabilities
of 5A and 6M were shown by plotting the interactions at 3 ns (Figure 8), 6, and 10 ns.
Interactions at 6 and 10 ns are shown for 5A and 6M in Figures S4 and S5, respectively.

Figure 8 Interactions of (I) 4A,
(II) 5A, and (III) 6M to HSA were shown
after 3 ns of MDS. The 3D and 2D views of the interactions are shown
in panels A and B, respectively. The 3D figure is showing the orientation
of the molecule in the binding groove, and the nature of the interactions
is shown in 2D visualization.

3 Conclusions
The present study gives
the detailed description about the binding
mechanism of androstenedione and its derivatives to HSA and AGP with
various biophysical techniques. Fluorescence studies show that the
synthesized compounds (4A, 5A, and 6M) can interact with both HSA
and AGP, however, with more affinity toward HSA. The association constants
and free energies were found to be 5.3 ± 2 × 104, 5.3 ± 1 × 104, and 9.5 ± 0.2 × 104 M–1 and −6.59, −6.51, and
−6.83 kcal/mol, respectively, with HSA. Among 4A, 5A, and 6M,
the methyl derivative (6M) has high affinity toward HSA and AGP. Competitive
binding studies by site-specific markers indicate that the compounds
4A and 5A are binding to domain III of HSA, whereas 6M is binding
to domain II of HSA. Conformational changes in the protein upon ligand
binding were observed by CD spectroscopy, which indicates that there
is a partial unfolding of the protein upon binding of 4A, 5A, and
6M. Further, these studies were corroborated by in silico studies
wherein hydrogen bonding, hydrophobic interactions, and van der Waals
interactions are major driving forces toward high affinities to HSA.
Furthermore, the rmsd values from MDS data show that the complexes
are stabilized after 15 ns. The Rg data calculated using MDS further
support the partial unfolding of the protein during ligand binding
as observed in CD spectroscopy.

The synthesized molecule 6M
is a methyl derivative of 5A and shows
approximately 2-fold and 10-fold increased affinity toward HSA and
AGP, respectively, because of the presence of additional methyl group
wherein hydrophobic interactions slightly dominate over other forces.
The present study reiterates the importance of synthetic molecules
in the drug discovery that enhance the drug distribution at the target
sites without sacrificing the drug activity.

4 Materials
and Methods
4.1 Preparation of Stock Solutions
Pure
fat-free HSA and AGP (purchased from Sigma-Aldrich) were dissolved
at a concentration of 1.0 mM in an aqueous solution of 0.1 M phosphate
buffer at a physiological pH 7.4. Stock solutions of 5 mM 4A, 5A,
and 6M (Scheme 1) were
prepared by dissolving appropriate amounts of 4A, 5A, and 6M in dimethyl
sulfoxide (DMSO). The compounds 4A, 5A, and 6M were synthesized through
organocatalysis, and these compounds were pure as reported earlier.12 The site-specific markers were prepared as 1
mM stock solution. Final working concentrations were maintained at
0.1 mM for all ligands and site-specific probes. All other chemicals
were of analytical grade and purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.

4.2 Measurements of Fluorescence Emission
Fluorescence
emission spectra were recorded at 25 °C from a
wavelength range of 300–500 nm with an excitation wavelength
of 285 nm and a slit width of 8.0 nm for both excitation and emission
using a PerkinElmer LS55 fluorescence spectrophotometer. Final concentration
of HSA and AGP were fixed at 1 × 106 M–1, and the increasing concentrations of compounds varied from 1 to
9 × 106 M–1 were suspended in 0.1
M phosphate buffer with pH 7.4. Three independent experiments were
performed, and each time, identical spectra were obtained. The binding
constant was calculated by taking the maximum fluorescence emission
at 350 nm for HSA and 340 nm for AGP using the Stern–Volmer
equation.

4.3 Molecular Displacement Experiment with Site-Specific
Markers
For competitive binding studies, the site-specific
probes were used. The site markers phenylbutazone and ibuprofen specifically
bind to subdomains IIA and IIIA of HSA. The solution having the protein
and the site marker in a ratio of 1:1 was titrated with increasing
concentrations of 4A, 5A, and 6M from 1:1 to 1:10 to HSA. The fluorescence
emission spectra were recorded as mentioned above. The binding constant
values were evaluated using the Stern–Volmer equation.

4.4 CD Spectroscopy Measurements
The
CD measurements of HSA in the presence and absence of 4A, 5A, and
6M were made in the range of 195–260 nm using a JASCO J-815
CD spectropolarimeter and a quartz cell with a path length of 0.2
cm. For all spectra, the baseline was subtracted using buffer. HSA
was made into a solution using 10 mM phosphate buffer at pH 7.4. The
HSA-to-ligand concentration was varied in a ratio of 1:1 to 1:5, and
the CD spectra were recorded. Three scans were accumulated at a scan
speed of 100 nm min–1, and the bandwidth was kept
at 2 nm. Finally, the CD spectra data collected were deconvoluted
using CDNN 2.1 software to get the percentages of secondary structural
elements. The JASCO J-815 CD spectropolarimeter was attached to a
Peltier, which facilitated the measurement of secondary structural
changes with increasing temperatures from 25 to 85 °C.

4.5 Molecular Docking
To find out the
binding site, interacting residues, and the type of interactions involved
in the complex formation, in silico docking was performed using AutoDock
4.2.3 program.46 AutoDock 4.2.3 uses the
Lamarckian genetic algorithm (GA).47 The
known crystal structure of HSA was taken from the protein data bank
(PDB), and its PDB ID is 1AO6. The protein was edited in AutoDock. Before using
it, water molecules and ions were removed. Hydrogen atoms were added
to the functional groups and ionized as required at physiological
pH. Further, Kollman united atom partial charges were assigned to
HSA. The ligand structures (4A, 5A, and 6M) were designed using Discovery
Studio 3.5. The two-dimensional (2D) structures of the ligands were
drawn, and the geometry was optimized. The energy minimization was
performed to relieve the steric effects. Both protein and ligand files
were saved as the PDBQT format. PDBQT is the readable format for AutoDock.
HSA was held rigid, all torsion bonds of the ligands were considered
as free, and there was no consideration regarding the effect of solvent
on the interactions. Blind docking was performed to locate the binding
site of the ligands. The size of the grid box was set to a maximum
with 0.0637 nm grid spacing. The center of the grid was set to 2.95,
3.18, and 2.35 nm. The docking parameters used were as follows: GA
population size: 150 and maximum number of energy evolutions: 250 000.
During docking, a maximum number of top 30 conformers were considered,
and the rms cluster tolerance was set to 0.2 nm. A conformer with
the least free energy and whose binding energy was close to the experimentally
determined free energy values was considered. The conformer was visualized
using PyMOL software.48

4.6 Molecular Dynamics Simulations
GROMACS
4.0 package was used for molecular dynamics studies, using GROMOS96
43a1 force field.49 The protein conformation
with lowest binding energy, which is close to the experimentally obtained
value, was taken as an initial structure. The protein topology was
prepared using pdb2gmx, which can read PDB files and generate coordinate
and topology in the GROMACS format. The topology parameters of the
ligands were created using PRODRG2.5 server.50−52 The box type
used is dodecahedron, which defines the unit cell. The protein was
placed at 1.0 nm from the box edge. The simulation was done in the
aqueous system by taking a simple point charge water model. HSA is
a negatively charged protein, and the neutralization was done by adding
15 Na+ ions. Energy minimization was done for the entire
system having proteins, ligands, ions, and water molecules to release
conflicting contacts. The minimization was performed, which optimizes
the geometry and solvent orientation, using the steepest descent method
of 1000 steps, followed by another 1000 steps of conjugate gradient
energy minimization. Before proceeding to production, MD step equilibration
was done. Equilibration of the system brings it to proper temperature
and pressure conditions. The equilibration was performed in two phases.
In the first phase, NVT, position restrain of the solute was done
at 300 K for 100 ps, followed by NPT at 1 bar pressure. Berendsen
thermostat and Parrinello-Rahman pressure coupling were used for temperature
coupling and pressure coupling, respectively.52 Then, the system was subjected to 100 ns MD at 300 K temperature
and 1 bar pressure. The motion equations were integrated using the
leap-frog algorithm. The trajectories were recorded at every 10 ps
interval.
