Micelles are good
devices for use as controlled drug delivery systems
because they exhibit the ability to protect the encapsulated substance
from the routes of degradation until they reach the site of action.
The present work assesses loading kinetics of a hydrophobic drug,
pilocarpine, in polymeric micellar nanoparticles (NPs) and its pH-dependent
release in hydrophilic environments. The trigger pH stimulus, pH 5.5,
was the value encountered in damaged tissues in solid tumors. The
new nanoparticles were prepared from an amphiphilic block copolymer,
[(HEMA19%-DMA31%)-(FMA5%-DEA45%)]. For the present research, three systems were validated,
two of them with cross-linked cores and the other without chemical
stabilization. A comparison of their loading kinetics and release
profiles is discussed, with the support of additional data obtained
by scanning electron microscopy and dynamic light scattering. The
drug was loaded into the NPs within the first minutes; the load was
dependent on the degree of cross-linking. All of the systems experienced
a boost in drug release at acidic pH, ranging from 50 to 80% within
the first 48 h. NPs with the highest degree (20%) of core cross-linking
delivered the highest percentage of drug at fixed times. The studied
systems exhibited fine-tuned sustained release features, which may
provide a continuous delivery of the drug at specific acidic locations,
thereby diminishing side effects and increasing therapeutic rates.
Hence, the studied NPs proved to behave as smart controlled drug delivery
systems capable of responding to changes in pH.

==== Body
Introduction
The use and development
of micro/nanostructures in smart drug/gene
delivery systems have caught the attention of the research community
for the last two decades or so, and some interesting reviews have
summarized the last trends in this field.1−3 The controlled
drug delivery is not only advantageous in suppressing the side effects
of the toxic drugs but also in overcoming the drawbacks of insoluble
drugs, especially of anticancer molecules such as doxorubicin.4 Among the most promising systems, organic nanoparticles
(NPs) are being widely studied. The formation of organic nanoparticles
can be achieved not only by the self-assembly of two mixed components
of opposed hydrophilic/hydrophobic nature5 but also by the use of amphiphilic block copolymers, leading to
nanosized micelles.6 By ensuring the homogeneity
of the generated nanoparticles, the latter method allows the reliable
preparation of formulations widely used in varied fields, from drug
delivery, biosensors, and gene therapy to cosmetics, among others.2,7

In the face of common drawbacks in therapeutic treatments,
such
as the difficulty of getting the drug across biological barriers and
reaching the damaged tissue or the degradation that takes place once
the drug enters the organism, smart nanosized systems have become
the option of choice. The internal hydrophobic nature of the NPs would
protect the drug against the degradative environment on its way to
the biological target.

Micelles from diblock copolymers are
one of the most popular drug
delivery systems (DDS), leading to core–shell micelles, which
are able to transport lipophilic molecules into its core.1,8 ABC triblock copolymers are another option which leads to the formation
of core–shell–corona micelles. The presence of a highly
hydrophilic corona layer makes them very stable in aqueous media.4,9 Methacrylate esters,10 poly(ethylene
glycol),4,11 and chitosan12 among others are the most common hydrophilic segments, and regarding
the hydrophobic blocks, polycaprolactone,4 poly(propylene oxide),13 poly(dimethylsiloxane),10 ciclodextrins,2,11and other methacrylate
derivatives14 can be found.

Moreover,
the so called smart NPs can be designed in such a way
that they respond to changes within the human body as a means of boosting
the drug concentration where it is required. One highly useful trigger
stimulus is the reduction in pH commonly encountered in cancerous
tissues of solid tumors. The presence of tertiary amine groups in
the block copolymers imparts pH-responsive properties to the final
micelles, as has recently been confirmed.15 However, the dynamic, reversible nature of micelle formation is
a source of instability. As the micelles can be dissociated at low
concentrations (below its critical micelle concentration), the premature
drug release at normal tissues or organs may be accelerated, prompting
serious side effects.4 The disruption of
NPs by dilution can be prevented if they are properly cross-linked,
either in the shell, or in the core,16 leading
to stable unimolecular NPs, the former option being the most widely
investigated. The core cross-linking approach circumvents the potential
intermicellar reaction because the hydrophilic block in the shell
acts by minimizing the chain overlap between adjacent micelles via
a steric stabilization mechanism, thus preventing intermicelle cross-linking.17

Our research group has carried out the
preparation of smart, pH-responsive
core cross-linked NPs as potential DDS,15 and the aim of the present work is the validation of these NP dispersions
as drug carriers able to control the release of an active lipophilic
molecule upon a trigger stimulus. As far as the authors are aware,
this is the first time that the influence of the degree of core cross-linking
in the uptake and release of a hydrophobic drug has been investigated
in NPs used as DDS. Pilocarpine, a hydrophobic drug, was the molecule
of choice. The uptake kinetics of the drug by cross-linked and non-cross-linked
systems were compared, as well as its release under various conditions.
The findings were supported by data collected from scanning electronic
microscopy (SEM), dynamic light scattering (DLS), UV–visible
spectroscopy, and other techniques.

Results and Discussion
Preparation
of NPs from the Autoassembly Block Copolymer [(DMA31% HEMA19%)-block-(DEA45%-FMA5%)] (Samples S1, S2, and S3)
The preparation of the amphiphilic block
copolymer used in the present work has been published elsewhere15 and is summarized in Scheme 1. The synthesis was carried out by the widely
used atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) at ambient temperature,
a “living” polymerization procedure that allows the
reliable formation of block copolymers by means of one-pot reactions.
In this case, the hydrophilic block, constituted by N,N-dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate (DMA) and 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate
(HEMA) monomers, was formed first, followed by the subsequent addition
of the hydrophobic monomers N,N-diethylaminoethyl
methacrylate (DEA) and furfuryl methacrylate (FMA), leading to the
formation of the hydrophobic block. The experimental copolymer composition
(in mole percentage), determined by proton nuclear magnetic resonance
(1H NMR), was found to be [(DMA31% HEMA19%)-block-(DEA45%-FMA5%)]. The values of molecular weights and polydispersity were calculated
by gel permeation chromatography and were found to be Mn = 34 700; Mw = 45 100;
and Mw/Mn =
1.3.

Scheme 1 One-Pot Synthesis of Methacrylate-Based Block Copolymers by
ATRP
Initiator: ethyl-2-bromo-2-methylpropionate
(EBiB); catalyst: CuBr; ligand: 2,2′-bipyridyl (bipy).

The autoassembly features of that copolymer in aqueous
media were
studied. The properties of the generated NPs, such as size, polydispersity,
shape, and critical micelle concentration (CMC),18,19 were explored by means of various techniques: SEM, DLS, UV–vis
spectroscopy, and others. The CMC value (0.078 mg/mL) demonstrates
the great tendency to self-assemble into micelles in aqueous media.
Accordingly, well-defined micelles were formed at pH 7.0 (Figure 1A) when the polymer
concentration stood at 0.25 mg/mL (sample S1). The hydrophobic blocks,
formed by DEA/FMA moieties, constituted the dehydrated micelle cores,17 leaving the hydrophilic blocks (formed by DMA
and HEMA moieties) in the outer part of the NPs in contact with the
aqueous medium.

Figure 1 (A) Micelles from autoassembly of the amine-containing
amphiphilic
block copolymers in aqueous media (nonstabilized micelles); (B) solution
of protonated polymer chains, (C) stabilized NPs by core cross-linking;
and (D) stable amine-containing NPs with hydrophilic and hydrated
core.

The disruption of these micelles
can be a priori boosted by dilution
or under acidic environment (Figure 1B). The use of a cross-linker can lead to the formation
of covalent bonds between the furan moieties present in the core (Figure 1C). Thus, the micellization
would become irreversible once the cross-linking reaction took place,
making them stable under those conditions, whether at high dilution
or at acid pH (Figure 1D). Consequently, another two systems were prepared at the same polymer
concentration, with the aim of core cross-linking the micelles and
hence obtaining stable NP dispersions. To accomplish this requires
a simple, fast, and reliable reaction with some specific features
(e.g., high yields and absence of side products). Those reactions
that meet such attributes are grouped under the denomination of click
reactions, the Diels–Alder reaction being one of them. One
of the most widely used Diels–Alder reactions is that involving
a maleimide ring and a furan ring.20 Thus,
furan rings present in the micellar core would react in pairs with
the two maleimide groups from the freshly prepared cross-linker (1,8-dimaleimide-3,6-dioxaoctane,
DMDOO). The degree of cross-linking was fixed in these assays (sample
S2 with 20% of cross-linking, and sample S3 with 10% of cross-linking)
so that two dispersions of stable NPs were achieved (Figure 1C).

Size and Shape Morphology
of NPs S1–S3 and Stability at pH
5.5 (ac-S1 to ac-S3)
The shape
and surface morphology of prepared NPs were
evaluated by SEM and DLS. The studies revealed that most of the NPs
were fairly spherical in shape. Studies carried out on S1 demonstrated
the formation of dispersions with a low polydispersity index (PdI,
0.14) and average hydrodynamic diameter (Dh) by DLS of 210 nm (Table 1). As far as the dispersions S2 and S3 are concerned, the
cross-linking of the NPs resulted in a minor increase in PdI in both
assays (to values close to 0.3), with the main population of NPs (95%
of the total) at just over 100 nm (Table 1). The analyses of SEM images revealed, first,
that the average particle sizes of samples S1, S2, and S3 were 95,
49, and 65 nm, respectively, which evidenced an overestimation of
NPs’ sizes by DLS. On the other hand, a significant reduction
in size (between 31 and 48% from SEM data) was observed for the cross-linked
NPs, in comparison with sample S1.

a As determined by DLS of non-cross-linked
NP (non-XL) and stabilized NP at 20 or 10% of cross-linking (XL 20%
and XL 10%, respectively) at pH 7.0 (unloaded or loaded with pilocarpine)
and at pH 5.5.

The pH of
the media and the drug loading displayed a marked impact
on the NP size. At acidic pH, not only did the cross-linked NPs (ac-S2
and ac-S3) undergo a dramatic increase in size (from 5 to 10 times)
but this effect was also dependent on the degree of cross-linking.
The same trend was also encountered when loading NPs were analyzed
(LS1, LS2, and LS3). This observation is well depicted in Figures 2 and 3 and discussed below.

5.5 prepared from the
block copolymer (DMA31% HEMA19%)-block-(DEA45%-FMA5%) synthesized by ATRP: (a) non-cross-linked

here “ac” denotes NPs dispersed in an acidic medium
at pH 5.5, “XL” denotes cross-linked NPs and “20%”
and “10%” the degree of cross-linking).

The success of the stabilization process was investigated
by both
dilution and treatment at acidic pH. When dispersions were diluted
with dimethylformamide to concentrations below CMC, the only samples
that remained stable were those with core cross-linking (S2 and S3),
validating the success of the coupling reactions.15

The samples were studied at pH 5.5 and 37 °C
to reproduce
the physiological conditions of pH and T to check
the integrity of the NP structures in an acidic environment similar
to that of damaged or targeted tissues in the human body. It was expected
that the presence of DMA and DEA repeating units would make possible
the protonation of both the shell and the core of the NPs. In the
event that the micelles were not cross-linked, the electrostatic repulsion
between the polymer chains would make them fly apart (Figure 1B). Notwithstanding, protonation
in the core should not be capable of breaking the three-dimensional
structure, and NPs with hydrated and hydrophilic cores could be obtained,
leading to fully hydrophilic NPs (Figure 1D).

The experimental trials were conducted
immersing the NPs in a buffered
solution at pH 5.5 (samples ac-S1, ac-S2, and ac-S3). The findings
from both DLS studies and SEM images (Table 1, Figures 2 and 3) confirmed that all of
the dispersions remained stable at acidic pH, including that of the
nonstabilized NPs ac-S1. Unexpectedly, and as confirmed by SEM images
(Figure 2a), protonation
of the polymer in sample ac-S1 was not capable of breaking up the
micelles, which kept their integrity. This behavior may be due to
the difficulties encountered by the acidic water solution to enter
the core of the micelles and then protonate the basic residues of
the DEA units, leading to a polymer solution. Besides, it is hypothesized
that the high number of hydroxyl groups from HEMA moieties present
in the hydrophilic blocks partially prevented the electrostatic repulsion
between the cationic charges in the shell of the micelles, keeping
them intact at acidic pH.

In addition, the study of the three
parameters, Z-average, mean size (Dh) calculated by
DLS, and mean size calculated from SEM images (Figure 3), showed that the cross-linked samples increased
in size at acid pH (Table 1). The values for sample ac-S2 (with 20% of cross-linking)
were significantly higher than those for sample ac-S3 (with 10% of
cross-linking). Conversely, the increase in size of the non-cross-linked
NPs was insignificant.

The latter findings could be explained
on the grounds of the excellent
packing efficiency of the polymer chains in the nucleus in nonstabilized
NPs (S1/ac-S1), which would be impeded by the reaction of the bismaleimide
DMDOO with the furan moieties in the nucleus of samples S2/ac-S2 and
S3/ac-S3. The length of the cross-linker and the formation of two
bulky tricyclic systems (Figure 4) can hinder, to some extent, the packing of the polymer
hydrophobic segments in the core of the NPs. This effect is greater
when the degree of cross-linking is 20%, leading to looser cores in
samples ac-S2 and LS2. Consequently, the latter samples, with looser
cores, enable entry of the aqueous medium into the core of the NPs.
This feature had a great impact not only on the final size of the
NP at pH 5.5 but also on both the loading kinetics and the percentage
of drug released from each system, as described below. All in all,
the dispersions S2 and S3 were stable for months, in a wide range
of pH (from pH 3.0 to pH 8.0) and at high dilutions. This is supported
by the study of an important colloid property, zeta potential. The
samples were titrated and z-potential measured. The
values were in the range from 45 to 60 mV, at acid pH, which also
demonstrated the excellent stability of the prepared NPs. This remarkable
stability might be attributed to the hydrophobic cross-linking cores
and the steric hindrance from the hydrophilic corona. These findings
support the conclusion that the prepared NPs could be promising candidates
for drug delivery applications.

Loading Kinetics of Pilocarpine by the Novel Dispersions (Samples LS1–LS3)
When the loading capability
of the lipophilic molecules had been confirmed for the studied NPs,15 some drug-uptake assays were carried out, using
pilocarpine as the molecule of choice. Pilocarpine is a therapeutic
molecule (online resource 1, Figure S1)
with low water solubility and is used clinically as co-drug in glaucoma
and xerostomia, as well as in the treatment of head and neck cancer;
it is also prescribed against Sjögren’s syndrome. Salivary
gland hypofunction, commonly developed during radiation therapy for
head and neck cancer and in patients with Sjögren’s
syndrome,21 leads to diminished secretions
and the acidification of saliva. This latter characteristic would
affect the regular homeostasis of the oral cavity, leading not only
to specific changes in the salivary bacterial profiles22 but also to demineralization of the tooth enamel,
with the consequent increase in the risk of caries.23 In this context, because it can stimulate salivary tissues,
pilocarpine is used to reduce the severity of xerostomia and salivary
dysfunction. The incorporation of pilocarpine into pH-sensitive NPs
allows the drug to be released under such acidic environments and
exert its therapeutic activity.

Previous to the pilocarpine-loading
studies, two linear regression analyses were conducted at pHs 7.0
and 5.5 to ascertain the relationship between pilocarpine concentration
in aqueous solutions and its absorbance at 215 nm in UV spectroscopy
(online resource 1, Figure S2). The regression
analysis quantified the final concentration of pilocarpine in the
media during the uptake and delivery assays.

The loading experiments
were conducted at pH 7.0 and 25 °C,
with a drug–polymer ratio equal to 0.8 mg of pilocarpine/mg
of polymer. The drug was added, and the dispersions were analyzed
at specific times. The loading of the drug by non-cross-linked and
cross-linked systems was monitored for 144 h (Figure 5, assays LS1, LS2, and LS3 for non-cross-linked,
20 and 10% cross-linked NPs, respectively).

Figure 5 Kinetic studies at 25
°C of pilocarpine loading in NPs by
UV–vis spectroscopy at 215 nm (initial pilocarpine concentration
= 0.1 mg/mL; polymer concentration = 0.125 mg/mL). (A) Absorbance
of free pilocarpine in NP dispersion vs time; (B) cumulative percentage
of pilocarpine embedded into the NPs vs time, calculated from absorbance
values at 215 nm.

The interactions among
the NPs and the drug were expected to be
hydrophobic due to the chemical structure of the drug, and therefore
the drug may be allocated into the core of the NP. This is supported
by previous assays in which another hydrophobic and fluorescent molecule,
pirene, was embedded into NPs and was confirmed by fluorescence microscopy
as well as by an extensive research carried out by other authors.15,24,25 The interaction of pilocarpine
with the NPs at neutral pH provoked a significant drop in absorbance
at 215 nm in 30 min (Figure 5A), probably due to the alteration of the excited electronic
states of the drug (with impinge on the ε parameter). Thus,
the nonloaded pilocarpine that remained in the medium may be largely
responsible for the absorbance figures at 215 nm.

Therefore,
the percentage of uploading was determined using the eq 1 1  where uploading (%) is the entrapped
pilocarpine
into the NPs in percentage, drug conc0 is the initial amount
of pilocarpine at time = 0 (μg drug/mL) in the media and residual
drug conct is the concentration of pilocarpine
in the media at time = t (μg drug/mL). This
last value was calculated using the eq 2, the equation being obtained experimentally from the
calibration curve of pilocarpine (online resource 1, Figure S2). 2  where A is the absorbance
of the sample at 215 nm and 25 °C.

As a result, being lipophilic
enough to efficiently bind pilocarpine,
the NP cores removed the drug from the aqueous environment quickly.
The findings also demonstrated that nonetheless the uptake is a dynamic
procedure, and hence a period of stabilization of 48 h was required.
This is especially important when cross-linked NPs were studied. Figure 5A displays this effect
for samples LS2 and LS3. Consequently, some extra time was required
to report reliable results that they were not time dependent. Conversely,
once steady, the NP–drug complexes were stable for months within
a wide range of temperature, from 5 to 40 °C.

Despite pilocarpine’s
loading efficiency being above 80%
w/w in all cases (Figure 5B), a significant dissimilarity was observed between the non-
and the cross-linked NPs. Thus, for example, pilocarpine was almost
completely removed from the medium in LS2 and LS3 (the percentage
of remaining pilocarpine was 3.5 and 2.4%, respectively), whereas
just under 20% of the added pilocarpine (18%) remained in the medium
without being captured by the nonstabilized NPs (LS1). Another relevant
feature encountered was that the absorbance versus time curves for
the uploading trials did not converge at long times, supporting the
fact that those three systems behave differently as nanocarriers.

In addition, and assuming that the presence in the core of the
adduct formed between the furan rings and the cross-linker DMDOO in
samples LS2 and LS3 (higher ratio in the former) provides some steric
hindrance and prevents the lipophilic segments of the block copolymer
being tightly organized, the higher the degree of cross-linking is,
the looser the cores will become. These findings demonstrated the
relevance not only of the stabilization of the NPs but also of their
percentage of cross-linking. On the basis of the hypothesis mentioned
above, it seems that the higher the degree of cross-linking is, the
higher is the free volume encountered into the core. As the drug tends
to enter in the core of the NPs due to its hydrophobic nature, this
could be easier once the free volume is boosted by any reason. As
a result, the incorporation of the therapeutic molecule was enhanced
in samples LS2 and LS3. This conclusion is supported by size studies
of loaded NPs by DLS (Table 1). In general terms, loaded NPs at pH 7.0 (samples LS1, LS2,
and LS3) display higher values of Z-average and mean
size (Dh) than unloaded NPs under the
same conditions (samples S1, S2, and S3). The most outstanding aspects
of these figures are that both Z-average and mean
size markedly increased in loaded cross-linked NPs (samples LS2 and
LS3), doubling and almost tripling their values compared with those
of the unloaded counterparts at neutral pH. With regards to the uploading
values encountered for LS2 and LS3, although being quite similar,
the presence of more hydrophilic oligoethylene glycol chains of the
cross-linker (Figure 4) in LS3 could diminish to some extent the affinity of the drug for
the core in that sample compared to that in LS2.

Pilocarpine
Release from Drug-Loaded NPs under a Trigger Stimulus
(Samples RS1–RS3)
The last
part of the present work was focused on evaluating the release of
pilocarpine from the NPs at neutral pH and in response to the acidification
of the aqueous media. The acidic pH was set at 5.5 as this value corresponds
to the pH encountered in oral secretions during the treatment of head
and neck cancer, as well as in patients with Sjögren’s
syndrome. The NPs were immersed in a buffer solution (either phosphate
buffer pH 7.0; or phosphate buffer pH 5.5). The drug content was evaluated
by UV–vis measurements at 215 nm, using the unloaded NPs as
blank. The cumulative pilocarpine release profiles from NPs at pHs
7.0 and 5.5 are shown in Figure 6.

Figure 6 Release of pilocarpine (related to the entrapped pilocarpine
into
the NPs, in percentage) vs time from pilocarpine-loaded NPs at pHs
7.0 and 5.5 at 37 °C (polymer concentration: 0.125 mg/mL).

The percent of drug release was
determined using eq 3 3  where mentrapped(0) is the weight of initial entrapped pilocarpine into the NPs; mresidual(t) is the weight of
residual pilocarpine at time “t” into
the nanocarriers.

For these trials, the use of normalized data
was made to compare
the capacity of the systems studied to retain or not the drug into
the NPs at different pHs. At neutral pH and from the normalized values
of the drug released from the NPs, some liberation was found in every
case, being low for the systems RS1 and RS3, in which most of the
drug remained in the NPs. These findings support the hypothesis that
on one hand, the looser the core of the NP is, the easier is the diffusion
of the drug to the media, this fact being more marked in the case
of sample RS2, and on the other hand, the drug could be present not
only in the NP core but also in the shell. Although it could be wrongly
inferred from a quick view of Figure 6 that non-cross-linked NPs (RS1) are better than 10%
cross-linking NPs (RS3) on releasing the drug, this was not the case.

When the loaded NPs were exposed to the trigger stimulus, i.e.,
the acidification of the media to pH 5.5, a boost in the drug release
was observed in all systems. The protonation of the tertiary amine
groups of DMA and DEA residues took place, and, as a result, the core
became hydrophilic, allowing entry of the aqueous media. Consequently,
the pilocarpine was no longer enclosed in a lipophilic environment
and between some 50 and 80% of the drug content was released in 48
h, depending on the system. To have a better understanding of the
release kinetics of the drug in the three studied systems, in the
case of cross-linked NPs (RS2 and RS3), the most significant fact
was that the more cross-linked the NP, the higher the observed percentage
of release at fixed times. Once more, how loosely entangled the core
was, played a crucial role in the performance of the NPs as drug delivery
systems. Interestingly, release figures from trials of non-cross-linked
NPs (RS1) were higher than those from trials of RS3 throughout the
studied period of time. It is hypothesized that some disruption of
the micellar structure might have taken place, causing liberation
of the drug into the media, confirming the benefits associated with
the cross-linking in the NPs formed.

Conclusions
Three
NP systems prepared from a new amphiphilic self-assembled
block copolymer, one of them nonstabilized and the other two stabilized
by means of core cross-linking, have been investigated in terms of
their drug loading and release capacities under physiological conditions.
The shape and structure of all of them were evaluated at pH 7.0 and
pH 5.5 by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and dynamic light scattering
(DLS). At pH 7.0, NPs in the range from 100 to 200 nm with low polydispersities
were found. Trials conducted in acidic media confirmed the integrity
of the NP structures at pH 5.5, and an increase in size was observed.

The loading of pilocarpine into the NPs has proved to be both a
highly efficient and dynamic procedure, with really fast loadings
within the first few minutes, and the NP–drug complexes were
stable for months. It was observed that the higher the degree of cross-linking
is, the higher is the amount of pilocarpine loaded into the NPs. Moreover,
the Z-average and mean size of loaded NPs doubled
and almost tripled in value for stabilized systems, giving weight
to the observations mentioned above. Regarding the drug-release behavior,
all of the systems experienced a boost in drug release at acidic pH,
ranging from 50 to 80% within the first 48 h. NPs with 20% of core
cross-linking delivered the highest percentage of drug at fixed times.
Also significant were the release values from the non-cross-linked
NPs, which may be due to some micellar disruption in the media.

The fine-tuned sustained release features encountered in the studied
systems may provide a continuous delivery of the drug at specific
acidic locations. Thereby, problems associated to cyclic variations
in drug concentration in blood versus time may be averted, offering
a maximum pharmacological efficiency at a minimum drug dose.
