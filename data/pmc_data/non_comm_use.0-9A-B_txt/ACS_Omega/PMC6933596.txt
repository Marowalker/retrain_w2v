Two monolanthanide-containing polyanions based on monolacunary
Keggin germanotungstates [Ln(H2O)nGeW11O39]5– (Ln = Dy, Er, n = 4,3) have been synthesized in simple one-pot synthetic
procedure and compositionally characterized in solid state by single-crystal
X-ray diffraction, powder X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared
spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis, and elemental analysis.
Electronic absorption and emission spectra of the title compounds
in solution were also studied. The [DyIII(H2O)4GeW11O39]5– Keggin POM exhibits a slow relaxation of magnetization. The cyclic
voltammetry measurements and mass spectrometry were carried out to
check the stability of the compounds in solution. Both polyanions
prove efficient in the electrocatalytic reduction of nitrite. To our
knowledge, this observation establishes the first example of electrocatalysis
of nitrite reduction by all inorganic monolanthanide-containing germanotungstates
family.

Introduction
Polyoxometalates (POMs) are discrete metal
oxygen cluster anions
constructed from early transition metals (M = V, Nb, Ta, Mo, W) in
their highest oxidation state and are being extensively studied because
of their application in catalysis, energy, molecular magnetism, biochemistry,
optics, and separation science.1−16 Lacunary POM ligands are versatile inorganic building blocks for
the construction of molecule-based materials. However, the reaction
conditions such as concentration of the reactants, temperature, pH
value, time, pressure, and organic/inorganic co-ligands can also play
an important role in the isolation of desired products. Meanwhile,
the structural varieties and functionalities of these materials could
be tuned by the incorporation of different transition-metal ions,17−20 rare earth (RE) metal cations,21−27 and mixed TM–RE metal centers.28−31 Lanthanide cations with high
coordination number are generally considered as suitable linkers for
linking POM fragments into discrete nanosized POM frameworks or extended
structures. In other words, the larger ionic size of 4f ions compared
to 3d metal ions hinder their full incorporation in the lacunary sites
of the POM ligands; therefore, additional sites are available for
further derivatization, which result in giant architectures.32−45

Over the last few decades, lanthanide-containing POMs (LnPOMs)
have been mainly studied because of their potential applications in
various fields, such as molecular magnetism,3,10,46 photoluminescence,4,47−49 and imaging.50,51 In the field of molecular
magnetism, lanthanide ions (typically Tb, Dy, Ho, and Er) are investigated
for the search of single-molecule magnets (SMMs) with a high blocking
temperature due to their usual large magnetic moments and large magnetic
anisotropy. Single-molecule magnets are individual high-spin molecules
displaying a slow spin relaxation and preserving their magnetic moment
below the characteristic blocking temperature (TB).3,10,46 Interestingly,
[ErW10O36]9– is the first
polyoxometalate behaving as a single-molecule magnet (SMM) and can
be considered as a molecular analogue of classical bulk ferromagnet.46 Regarding the advances of POMs in catalysis,
the most fascinating properties of POMs in the catalysis applications
are their high thermal stability, structural flexibility, tunable
redox potential, and fundamental impedance to oxidative decomposition.
These unique properties allow the POMs-based catalysts to be constructed
at the molecular level. The catalytically active sites of POMs can
be finely tuned with an appropriate combination of lanthanide cation
and lacunary POMs as inorganic ligands. Numerous LnPOM catalysts have
been produced with different structural types (i.e., Keggin versus
Dawson) and chemical compositions (nature and number of rare earth
metals incorporated). The concurrence of both Lewis acid (Ln ions)
and Lewis base (POM) in LnPOMs has been found to show great potential
in the development of catalytic systems for various chemical processes
and various organic reactions.52−58 The first report on monolanthanide-containing POMs were published
in 1971 by Peacock and Weakley, which showed that lanthanide cations
react rapidly with monolacunary [α-SiW11O39]8– to give both 1:1 and 1:2 LnPOMs..59 Some examples of 1:1 LnPOM are [RE(H2O)n(XW11O39)]m− (X = Si, Ge, P, RE = LaIII, CeIII, NdIII, SmIII, EuIII, YbIII, GdIII DyIII, YIII) and [Ln(α-SiW11O39)(H2O)3]5– (Ln = LaIII, PrIII, CeIII, NdIII, SmIII, EuIII, YbIII, GdIII), and examples of 1:2 LnPOM
are [Ln(α-SiW11O39)2]13– (Ln = NdIII, PrIII, CeIII).27,60−67

Kortz and co-workers reported the synthesis and structural
characterization
of dimeric 1:2 LnPOMs [Ln(β2-SiW11O39)2]13– (Ln = LaIII, CeIII, SmIII, EuIII, GdIII, TbIII, YbIII, LuIII) based on
chiral Keggin units [β2-SiW11O39]8–.68 Zhang et al.
studied the static electrostatic interactions of the gadolinium derivative
[Gd(β2-SiW11O39)2]13– with human serum albumin.69 There are many reports on organic–inorganic hybrid
monolacunary Keggin polyoxotungstate based 3d–4f heterometallic
derivatives where [RE(H2O)n(XW11O39)]m− and copper–organic linkers have been used to make extended
architectures.70−84 Here, we report on the monolanthanide-containing polyanions based
on the monolacunary α-Keggin tungstogermanate, [Ln(H2O)nGeW11O39]5– (Ln = Dy, Er, n = 4,3), which have
been synthesized under normal bench conditions by the reaction of
LnCl3·6 H2O (Ln = Dy, Er) and K8[γ-GeW10O36]·6H2O in
1 M LiOAc buffer pH 4.8 and characterized by single-crystal X-ray
crystallography, powder X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared
spectroscopy, elemental analysis, thermogravimetric analysis, mass
spectrometry, UV–vis absorption spectroscopy, and luminescence
spectroscopy. The solution-stable title compounds were tested for
their activity in the electrocatalytic reduction of nitrite.

Results and Discussion
Synthesis
The title polyanions [Dy(H2O)4GeW11O39]5– (1) and [Er(H2O)3GeW11O39]5– (2) were prepared by the
reaction of LnIII (Ln = Dy, Er) ions with dilacunary Keggin-type
polyanion [γ-GeW10O36]8– in 1 M LiAOc buffer (pH 4.8) media at 70 °C. It is important
to note that the isolation of K5[Dy(H2O)4GeW11O39]·16H2O (K-1) and K5[Er(H2O)3GeW11O39]·20H2O (K-2)
was only possible at pH 4.8 and with metastable precursor polyanion
[γ-GeW10O36]8–. The
morphology of the isolated POM crystals were investigated by scanning
electron microscopy (SEM). Figure 12 shows the micrographs of K-1 and K-2, which have tetragonal crystals and rectangular block
crystals, respectively.

Single-Crystal X-Ray Structure Determination
The molecular
and packing structures of [Dy(H2O)4GeW11O39]5– (1) and [Er(H2O)3GeW11O39]5– (2) were determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction
(Figures 1, 2, 3). Since the two monolanthanide-substituted
Keggin-type polyoxotungstates K-1 and K-2 are crystallized as isomorphous potassium salts in the tetragonal
space group I4/m with Z = 2, only the crystal structure of K-1 will be described.
Both polyanions belong to the 1:1 class of LnPOMs based on monolacunary
Keggin ions. The compound 1 is similar to [Dy(H2O)2(GeW11O39)]5– reported by group of Yang.60 The molecular
structure of the [Dy(H2O)4GeW11O39]5– anion is based on that of the Keggin
[GeW12O40]4– anion, but with
one of the four W = O residues lying on the I4/m mirror plane replaced by a {Dy(OH2)4}3+ moiety. Since Dy(2B)–O(1), where O(1) is the
germanate oxygen, is over 2.8 Å, the DyIII cation
is best described as eight-coordinated with a square-antiprismatic
geometry. The structural analysis shows that K-1 forms
an unusual closed three-dimensional (3D) framework architecture. Four
K+ per cluster link the polyoxometalates into a 3D structure;
the fifth K+ occupies the only available lattice cavity
in the structure, leaving no space for any lattice waters within the
crystal structure. The Er analogue K-2 differs only in
the number of aqua ligands coordinated to Er(2B); from the thermal
parameters of these, it is likely that there are only three such ligands
in the Er compound, consistent with the smaller ionic radius of ErIII. The aqua ligand variation in isostructural compounds K-1 and K-2 demonstrates that the lanthanide
contraction effect can play a prominent role in the coordination environment
of the lanthanide cations.85 To the best
of our knowledge, this represents a rare all-inorganic 3D framework
based on the monolanthanide-substituted Keggin tungstogermanate. The
Keggin fragments are of α-type in polyanions 1 and 2. The conversion of polyanion precursor from [γ-GeW10O36]8– to [α-GeW11O39]8– in acidic media have been facilitated
by the presence of lanthanides ions in the reaction mixture. Previously,
such a conversion has been observed under the hydrothermal condition
by the Yang group.86 Polyoxoanion 1 contains one [α-GeW11O39]8– subunit and one dysprosium metal ion, which occupies
the position that has been created by removal of a W–Ot group from the [α-GeW12O40]4– anion, which consists of a central {GeO4} tetrahedron surrounded by four vertex-sharing {W3O13} triads. Polyanion [Dy(H2O)4GeW11O39]5– is surrounded by potassium
as a counter cation, which is coordinated by eight O atoms. It should
be noted that both structures have substitutional disorder of Ln/W
in the Keggin anion, which has been refined with a Ln/W site occupancy
ratio of 0.25:0.75. It is a well-known fact that the structures of
most metal-substituted Keggin derivatives are disordered as a result
of the high symmetry of the Keggin ion.87 It is important to mention that the dilacunary polyanion [γ-GeW10O36]8– can easily isomerize
and/or decompose in acidic aqueous solutions to the corresponding
α- and β-isomers due to its metastable nature in solution
state. Normally, dilacunary α-Keggin fragments have a strong
tendency to transform to either [α-GeW11O39]8– or plenary Keggin ion [α-GeW12O40]4– by uptaking additional WVI centers (which can form in solution by partial decomposition
of the POM precursor) in acidic media below pH 5. However, the trilacunary
derivative [α-GeW9O34]10– anions are formed from the partial base degradation of Keggin anions
by the loss of a tungsten atom.84,88,89 Interestingly, transition-metal-substituted Keggin polyanions, which
could lead to the different multidimensional structures, are currently
investigated in the field of molecular magnetism90 and hydrogen evolution catalysis.87 These lanthanide-containing Keggin-type structures ([Ln(H2O)nGeW11O39]5– (Ln = Dy, Er, n = 4,3)) have potential
to be used as functional building block units for the formation of
porous nanostructured with the interaction of large cations i.e.,
[M3O(OAc)6(CH3OH)3]+ (M = Ru,Cr) and LnIII cations as linkers. This
synthetic approach has been recently investigated, where the combination
of large cations with symmetrical Keggin-type anions {GeW12} and {SiMo12} led to the formation of novel materials
with functionalities that can reflect both cationic and anionic moieties.11,91−93 Trials to obtain analogues of 1 and 2 with other lanthanide cations are currently underway.

PXRD Analyses
Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) is one
of the most useful tools to check the bulk purity of the crystalline
solids. PXRD was used to confirm the identity and phase purity of
crystallines K-1 and K-2. The measured powder
pattern and the simulated pattern from the solved crystal structure
match perfectly, which is a sufficient proof of phase-pure compounds
(Figure 4).

single-crystal X-ray diffraction structure of K-1.

IR Spectroscopy
Infrared spectroscopy is another frequently
employed technique for the characterization of polyoxometalates due
to their characteristic peaks in the region (1200–450 cm–1), which is called the fingerprint region for the
POM skeleton. The difference/shift in the characteristic bands of
the IR spectra of the lacunary precursor K8[γ-GeW10O36]·6H2O and synthesized compounds
indicate the formation of new compounds. Further, the similarity in
the Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra of K-1 and K-2 exhibit the isostructural nature of the compounds (Figure S1).

TG Analyses
Thermogravimetric (TG) analyses were carried
out to examine the thermal stability of K-1 and K-2 in solid state and the total content of water molecules
in the bulk material. In line with the structural similarity of K-1 and K-2, quite similar thermograms are observed
for both. The TG curves of K-1 and K-2 in
the range of room temperature to 1000 °C exhibit a gradual weight
loss step up to ca. 640 °C, which correspond to the removal of
the surface-adsorbed water molecules and crystal waters as well (Figure S3). The total amount of water estimated
by thermogravimetric analysis was clearly higher than those obtained
by the single-crystal structure analysis. This is due to the difference
in the single-crystal sample and bulk sample that contain surface-adsorbed
water molecules. The overall elemental composition of the bulk material
was also determined by complete elemental analysis. Thus, for bulk
studies, the compounds were formulated as K5[Dy(H2O)4GeW11O39]·16H2O (K-1) and K5[Er(H2O)3GeW11O39] 20H2O (K-2) based on single-crystal X-ray crystallography, elemental analysis,
and thermogravimetric analysis.

UV–vis Spectroscopy
UV–vis spectroscopy
measurements were performed on polyanions K-1 and K-2, and compared with the absorption spectrum of K8[α-GeW11O39]·13H2O. As
shown in Figure S4, two strong absorption
bands with maximum around 200 and 250 nm are observed in the spectra
of 1 and 2 solutions. The peak at 200 nm
is attributed to the Od → W charge transition and
the other peak at 250 nm is assigned to the Ob(c)→W
charge transition. These dominant ligand-to-metal charge-transfer
bands are the two characteristic bands of Keggin heteropolytungstate
complexes, which appear due to the transfer of electrons from filled
oxygen orbitals to the empty 5d orbitals of the WVI ions.
However, the absorption peaks in 1 and 2 have an obvious blue shift, and the intensity is enhanced compared
to that of the [α-GeW11O39]8–, which confirms the combination of [α-GeW11O39]8– and Ln ions (Ln = Dy, Er).

Emission Spectroscopy
Room-temperature photoluminescence
experiments were performed on K-1, K-2,
and K8[α-GeW11O39]·13H2O in aqueous solution. When the emission spectra of K-1, K-2, and K8[α-GeW11O39]·13H2O were studied with excitation
at 250 nm, the clearly visible peaks at 350, 550, and 667 nm were
observed. The same behavior was observed when the molecules were irradiated
with 300 nm excitation wavelengths. As depicted in Figure S5, the emission spectra of K-1, K-2, and K8[α-GeW11O39]·13H2O are, apart from intensity, almost the same
at room temperature, where the tungstogermanate emission is quenched.
It can also be observed that the emission intensity varied slightly
from K-1 to K-2. The resultant similar emission
profiles, but with different intensities, suggest the well-known quenching
effect of water molecules on the luminescence of POMs. This condensation
of tungstate groups results in more efficient emission; therefore,
the luminescence of the {GeW11} is not unexpected. However
the coordination environment and electronic nature of the incorporated
metal ions also determines the luminescence efficiency.4,94 From these structural arguments, it becomes clear that both K-1 and K-2 exhibited tungstate emission instead
of a LnIII emission.

Mass Spectrometry
Mass spectrometry (MS), specifically
electrospray ionization (ESI) MS, has been found to be useful in determining
the intact POMs core as they generally possess high inherent negative
charge. In this work, high-resolution ESI MS was used in water and
acetonitrile mixture. Intact cluster ion for both compounds K-1 and K-2 was observed in ESI MS in the negative-ion
mode. Strong signal with a single cation was observed for a 4-anionic
cluster with various number of attached H2O molecules.
For K-1, Li-exchanged peak appeared at the maximum intensity
at m/z 722.2 and 726.8, which are
assigned as Li[DyGeW11O39]4– and Li[Dy(H2O)GeW11O39]4–, respectively. Broad mass envelope compared with several possible
metal-ion exchanges is shown in Figure 5. Protonated and sodiated peaks were seen with lower
intensity, suggesting higher stability with Li exchange compared to
H or Na. Several K-exchanged peaks were also seen. Corresponding 3-charged
ions were seen in the mass range m/z 960–1030. Plausible assignments
are given in Table S1. Several dimeric
and trimeric peaks with a higher charge (5) were also seen in the
higher mass range (m/z 1200–2000),
confirming bonded stable structural motifs even in the gas phase.

Figure 5 ESI MS
of K-1 showing 2 sets of peaks at the mass
range 710–760 and 960–1030 corresponding to 4- and 3-charge
state, respectively. Strongest peak at m/z 715–730 is expanded in the inset (i). Different
alkali-metal-exchanged peaks were observed and the mass envelope is
compared with 5 different possible compositions, and their calculated
isotope distribution pattern is overlaid.

Similar ions were found when K-2 was
analyzed following
similar experimental condition. In case of K-2, protonated
H[ErGeW11O39]4– and H[Er(H2O)GeW11O39]4– were
found at maximum intensity unlike that of K-1. Li exchange
peak, although merged with the next peak, is visible as shown in Figure 6 (inset i). Although
Na exchange peak Na[ErGeW11O39]4– contributes to the similar mass range of Na[Er(H2O)GeW11O39]4–, it was identifiable
when compared with the calculated isotope pattern. Corresponding 3-species
was observed in the mass range m/z 960–1030. The source of Li ions, which have been identified
by mass spectrometry, is the adsorption of mother liquor (1 M LiAOc
buffer solution) at the crystal surface. However, the source of Na
ion is not clear.

Figure 6 ESI MS of K-2 shows 2 sets of peaks at the
mass range
710–760 and 960–1030 corresponding to 4- and 3-charge
states, respectively. Strongest peak at m/z 715–730 is expanded in the inset (i). Different
alkali-metal-exchange peaks are observed and the mass envelope is
compared with 4 different possible compositions, and their calculated
isotope distribution pattern is overlaid.

Electrochemical Characterization
The two compounds K-1 and K-2 seem to be sufficiently stable in
lithium acetate medium, in which they were synthesized, to be characterized
by cyclic voltammetry (CV). Upon comparing the CV of POM 2 with that of {GeW11} at pH 4 (Figure 7A), there is a shift of the redox peak potentials
toward less negative values when {GeW11} is coordinated
with Er cation. In fact, the main peak of the wave attributed to the
reduction of W(VI) centers was measured at −0.91 V vs saturated
calomel electrode (SCE) from the CV of {GeW11} and at −0.89
V vs SCE from the CV of polyanion 2. The composite feature
of the same reduction wave is more obvious in the case of compound 2, which has a clear shoulder at −0.82 V vs SCE, indicative
of a more pronounced alkaline character for this Er-substituted species
when compared to {GeW11}.95Figure S6 shows the CVs of the two compounds
recorded at different scan rates (ranging from 10 to 100 mVs–1) and the linear dependency of the peak current on the square root
of the scan rate, revealing that the electron-transfer process is
entirely diffusion-controlled. Interestingly, this seems not to be
the case with the compound Dy-GeW11. The CVs of POM 2 and of POM 1 exhibit marked similarities (Figure S7A); however, in the case of the latter,
there is a decrease of the peak current upon successive cycling. This
behavior suggests the formation of a film that influences the response
of the electroactive surface of the working electrode (Figure S7B).

Figure 7 (A) CVs of {GeW11} (black)
and POM 2 (blue)
recorded in 1.0 M LiCH3CO2 + CH3CO2H/pH 4.0. (B) CVs of POM 2 recorded in 1.0 M

4.0 (blue) and in pH 5.0 (red). POM concentration: 0.50 mM. Working
electrode: EPG; counter electrode: Pt gauze; reference electrode:
SCE. Scan rate: 10 mVs–1.

When the experiments are carried out at pH 5, the
whole CVs shift
toward the negative side of the potential scale (Figure 7B). In addition, the distinction
between the two reduction steps becomes more evident, with a first
peak at −0.90 V vs SCE, followed by a second one at −0.99
V vs SCE for Er-GeW11. At pH 5, the CVs of 2 and of 1 exhibit the same features and are strictly
superimposable (Figure S8). The reduction
of Ln cations present in tungstic POMs is difficult to observe in
an aqueous medium. It generally takes place at very low potentials
beyond the electrolyte reduction (water reduction wave). The reduction
of EuIII centers has been demonstrated in several cases
because this cation is reduced at the same potential range as the
WVI centers, but the other Ln cations are expected to remain
electrochemically silent in our experimental conditions.96−98

Electrocatalytic Properties
The electrocatalytic properties
of POM 2, which is representative of the two compounds,
have also been studied. In the presence of an excess nitrite ions,
the CVs of compound 2 undergo notable changes, namely,
the loss of reversibility of the reduction waves (Figures 8 and S9), indicative of the existence of an electrocatalytic phenomenon.
The latter becomes more pronounced when the CVs are recorded at small
scan rates. This effect may be quantified by the catalytic current, ICAT, which was calculated for each scan rate
at a convenient potential value, corresponding to the peak potential
of the reduction wave in the absence of nitrite ions: ICAT = [(ix – i0)/i0] × 100,
with ix and i0 being the peak currents in the presence and in the absence of nitrite,
respectively.99 In both cases, that is
at pH 4 and 5, ICAT represents the catalytic
efficiency of the POM toward the electroreduction of nitrite ions,
which increases exponentially when the scan rate decreases (Figure 9). At pH 5, ICAT varies from 15% at v =
100 mVs–1 to almost 200% at v =
2 mVs–1. At pH 4, the effect is even more pronounced, ICAT increases from 30% up to almost 500% within
the same scan rate span.

and pH 5.0 (red).

Magnetic Properties
To explore the potential SMM behavior,
alternating current (ac) magnetic susceptibility studies were carried
out on freshly filtered samples of K-1 compound. The
ac signals were observed in the out of phase without the maxima, which
is probably due to the presence of quantum tunneling of magnetization
(QTM) (Figure 10).
The presence of QTM can reduce the expected energy barrier, but it
is often possible to shortcut the QTM by applying a small static direct
current (dc) field over the range 0–2000 Oe. Therefore, ac
susceptibility measurements were performed at various dc fields to
find an optimum field of 900 Oe to slow down the relaxation time by
reducing or suppressing the quantum tunneling of magnetization (Figure 10). Therefore, the
in-phase (χ′) and out-of-phase (χ″) ac susceptibilities
as functions of frequency at various temperatures have been measured
using an applied dc field of 900 Oe (Figure 11). The frequency-dependent out-of-phase
susceptibility signals only show clear maxima between 2.0 and 2.6
K within the measurable frequency window and therefore cannot be analyzed
with an Arrhenius fit. Additional magnetic measurements are planned
to be performed on K-1 and K-2.

Conclusions
We have prepared a 1:1 family of LnPOMs
[Ln(H2O)nGeW11O39]5– (Ln = Dy, Er, n =
4,3) in simple one-pot synthetic
procedure and characterized in solid as well as solution state. Both
polyanions are formed by the transformation of the dilacunary POM
precursor [γ-GeW10O36]8– into the [α-GeW11O39]8– fragment in the presence of LnIII ions, which led to
the isolation of {LnGeW11} 1:1 LnPOMs. K-1 POM exhibits a slow relaxation of magnetization. Their stability
in solution wasere evaluated by cyclic voltammetry and mass spectrometry.
Both compounds show a strong catalytic activity towards the reduction
of nitrite ions. This work shows that monolacunary polyanion fragments
can be stabilized by lanthanide centers in solution and in the solid
state. The isolated highly symmetrical LnPOM -Keggin must be ideal
functional building blocks for the design of complex architectures.

Experimental Section

Synthetic Procedure for K5[Dy(H2O)4GeW11O39]·16H2O (K-1)
K8[γ-GeW10O36]·6H2O (0.58 g, 0.20 mmol) was dissolved
in 20 mL of 1 M lithium acetate buffer of pH 4.8. Then, DyCl3·6H2O (0.23 g, 0.61 mmol) was added to this solution
in small portions under stirring. The resultant turbid colorless solution
was stirred and heated at 70 °C for one hour. Later, the solution
was filtered and left to slowly evaporate at room temperature, and
colorless crystals were obtained after approximately two weeks. Yield
19% (based on W). IR (2% KBr pellet, ν/cm–1):3421 (brd), 1622 (wk), 1563 (shp), 1462(shp), 956 (shp), 884 (wk),
811 (wk) 678 (wk) 526, 464 (str), 401 (wk). Elemental analysis (%)
calc–1d (found): K 5.69 (6.10), Dy 4.73 (4.73),
W 58.83 (57.9), Ge 2.11 (2.03).

Synthetic Procedure for K5[Er(H2O)3GeW11O39]·20H2O (K-2)
The same procedure was employed to prepare (K-2) using ErCl3·6H2O instead of
DyCl3·6H2O. Yield 20% (based on W). IR
(2% KBr pellet, ν/cm–1): 3423 (brd), 1623
(str) 1563 (shp), 1458 (shp), 956(str), 885 (str), 813 (str), 679
(wk) 523 (wk) 466 (wk), 401 (wk). Elemental analysis (%) calcd (found):
K 5.60 (5.52), Er 4.78 (4.92), W 57.85 (57.8), Ge 2.08 (2.00).

Crystallography
Data on single crystals of K-1 and K-2 were collected at 180 K on a Stoe IPDS II area
detector diffractometer using graphite-monochromated Mo Kα radiation
(Table 1). Semiempirical
absorption corrections were applied using XPREP in SHELXTL.101 Structure solution was analyzed by dual-space
direct methods (SHELXT),101 followed by
full-matrix least-squares refinement (SHELX-2016).102 As is often the case in such Keggin structures, the central
Ge(1) occupies a site of I4/m symmetry
and appears to be bonded to eight symmetry-equivalent oxygens as a
result, although a given Ge in the crystal is only bonded to four
oxygens. O(1) was therefore refined with 50% occupancy. The single
lanthanide cation in the cluster, Dy(2B) or Er(2B), was disordered
against three W atoms W(2A) over four equivalent sites. In other words,
the lanthanide cation, Dy(2B) or Er(2B), was, together with three
W atoms, disordered over the four equivalent metal sites on the crystal
mirror plane (Wyckoff 8h positions in I4/m). Atom O(6A), the tungstyl W = O oxygen bonded to W(2A),
was thus refined with 75% occupancy. Electron density corresponding
to four aqua ligands coordinated to Dy(2B) could be identified and
refined with 25% occupancy. In K-2, one of these waters
(and its symmetry equivalent) had a rather high thermal parameter
and was refined as 12.5% occupancy; each Er probably has three rather
than four aqua ligands in the structure. The aqua ligands proved hard
to refine, being at best oxygen atoms at a quarter occupancy. In addition
to this, these ligands are disordered (in particular for the Er cluster,
where three such ligands are disordered over the four sites), so that
a more satisfactory refinement was not possible. No attempt was made
to locate the H-atoms on these aqua ligands. Electron density in a
cavity suggested the fifth (and badly disordered) K+ cation,
but attempts to refine it, or to model it using SQUEEZE, proved unsuccessful.
