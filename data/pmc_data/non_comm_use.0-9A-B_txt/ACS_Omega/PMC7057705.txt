The scaly bulbs of Lilium longiflorum (Liliaceae) are used as a food
ingredient and a traditional medicine
in East Asia. A preliminary study revealed that treatment with 100
μg/mL of the ethyl acetate fraction of this plant material inhibited
dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV) to 58.99%. Phytochemical studies
were conducted to identify the active ingredient, and five compounds,
namely, 1 (2.9 mg, 75.8% purity at 320 nm), 2 (12.2 mg, 97.9% purity at 320 nm), 3 (3.1 mg, 66.5%
purity at 320 nm), 4 (6.8 mg, 96.9% purity at 320 nm),
and 5 (6.2 mg, 90.2% purity at 320 nm) were purified
from 200 mg of the ethyl acetate fraction of L. longiflorum via centrifugal partition chromatography (CPC) with a two-phase
solvent system composed of chloroform/methanol/isopropanol/water (5:2:2:4,
v/v/v/v) in an ascending mode. Their structures were identified as
1-O-p-coumaroyl-2-O-β-glucopyranosylglycerol (regaloside D, 1), 3,6′-O-diferuloylsucrose (2), 1-O-p-coumaroyl-2-O-β-glucopyranosyl-3-O-acetylglycerol (regaloside B, 3), 1-O-p-coumaroylglycerol (4),
and 4-O-acetyl-3,6′-O-diferuloylsucrose
(5), respectively, by 1H and 13C NMR and MS analysis. Compounds 2 and 5 exhibited DPP-IV inhibitory activities with IC50 values
of 46.19 and 63.26 μM, respectively. Compounds 1, 3, and 4 did not show activities, indicating
that biphenylpropanoids linked via the sugar moiety are more effective
than phenylpropanoids with glycerol or glyceryl glucoside. This is
the first report of simultaneous separation of five phenylpropanoids
from L. longiflorum by CPC and evaluation
of their DPP-IV inhibitory activities.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Lily
(Lilium species) is a well-known
horticultural crop with various floral colors and patterns. Its scaly
bulbs, leaves, and petals have been used as a food and a traditional
medicine for many centuries in East Asia. Especially, the scaly bulbs
of Lilium species have been used to
treat coughs, sore throats, and hemoptysis because of dry lung or
lung heat, and insomnia associated with hallucinations, restlessness,
and irritability.1 Previous phytochemical
studies investigating Lilium species
reported the role of flavonoids,2,3 steroidal saponins,4−7 and phenypropanoids,2,8−11 as major constituents. These
compounds exhibit diverse biological activities including antiviral,3 antitumor,5,6 antidiabetic,8 anti-inflammatory,10 and anti-oxidant activities.11 Steroidal
saponins isolated from the bulbs of Lilium longiflorum showed inhibitory activity against 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate-stimulated 32P-incorporation into phospholipids of HeLa cells5 and promoted scratch wound closure by stimulating
fibroblast activation and migration via selective upregulation of
TGF-β type I receptors.6 Phenylpropanoid
glycerol glucosides isolated from the bulbs of L. longiflorum attenuated glucose production in a H4IIE rat hepatoma cell line.8

Natural products include secondary metabolites
with a wide range
of polarities and multiple stereochemistry. Therefore, the separation
and purification of these substances is tedious and laborious entailing
repeated chromatographic steps. In our previous trial, on the isolation
of bioactive principal compounds from the ethyl acetate fraction of L. longiflorum using open column chromatography and
preparative high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), the substances
with the expected purities were not separated because of the interaction
with the stationary phase. We observed sample loss and column deterioration
with fractions adhering to the solid support.12 Chemical decomposition also occurred while the fractions containing
high concentrations of the pure substance passed through the solid
stationary phase. Therefore, centrifugal partition chromatography
(CPC) was used to exclude the interaction between the solid stationary
phase and substances to purify the bioactive compounds from L. longiflorum. CPC is a solid-free separation technique
that uses immiscible two phases of the solvent.13 Because CPC uses only the liquid phase, there is no irreversible
sample absorption, sample loss, or sample denaturation.13 CPC can be used to recover the total injected
sample and facilitate high sample loading capacity.13 In addition, CPC can be easily converted into a normal
or a reverse phase by altering the solvent flow direction and the
mobile or stationary phases. Based on the extensive studies investigating
CPC development and application,14,15 it is obvious
that CPC is an efficient technique for preparative separation and
purification of natural products.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus is
characterized not only by insulin resistance
but also by impaired β-cell function.16,17 Regarding β-cell function, a marked decrease in the incretin
effect has been reported in patients with type 2 diabetes.17 Incretin effect refers to the intense stimulation
of insulin secretion when sugar was orally administered rather than
intravenously injected.17 This effect depends
on blood glucose and is reduced in diabetic patients compared with
healthy individuals.17 The discovery of
incretin hormones, glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide, and glucagon-like
peptide 1 (GLP-1) and their physiological degradation enzyme, dipeptidyl
peptidase IV (DPP-IV), has led to the development of GLP-1 agonists
and DPP-IV inhibitors, as the new targets for the treatment of type
2 diabetes mellitus.17 DPP-IV inhibitors
share the functions of the GLP-1 agonist but can also be administered
orally.18 Given the recent studies of DPP-IV
inhibitors, synthetic compounds have been used in current pharmacotherapy.19 As well, many active compounds derived from
natural sources exhibited DPP-IV inhibitory effects, and represent
promising drug candidates.20−23

In the present study, we used CPC to purify
major compounds from
the ethyl acetate fractions of scaly bulbs of L. longiflorum (Figure 1). The DPP-IV
inhibitory activities of these compounds were evaluated in vitro.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Preparation of Crude Phenylpropanoids
To identify new
DPP-IV inhibitors from herbal medicines and foods,
the methanol extract of the scaly bulbs of L. longiflorum and its solvent fractions, the n-hexane, chloroform,
ethyl acetate, and n-butanol fractions were tested
using a DPP-IV inhibitor screening assay and they (each 100 μg/mL)
showed an DPP-IV inhibition of 34.44, 29.07, 57.03, 58.99, and 31.59%,
respectively. Because the ethyl acetate fraction exhibited the strongest
DPP-IV inhibitory activity, it was subjected to CPC for further separation.

2.2 Selection of the Two-Phase Solvent System
The HPLC profile of the ethyl acetate fraction of the scaly bulbs
of L. longiflorum indicated three major
peaks, together with several minor peaks (Figure 2). For successful separation of the target
compounds using CPC, an optimal two-phase solvent system with an appropriate
partition coefficient (K) was developed. The K value is the ratio of the solute distributed between two
completely equilibrated solvent layers.24 A solvent system of n-hexane–ethyl acetate–methanol–0.05%
aqueous trifluoroacetic acid (3:5:3:5, v/v/v/v) reported in the literature
for the successful separation of phenylpropanoids from another species, Lilium lancifolium(11) was
first used to separate the target compounds. However, the HPLC profile
of the upper phase of this solvent system showed broad and unresolved
peaks, which prevented the calculation of the K value
(data not shown). Thus, we selected chloroform/methanol/isopropanol/water
(CHCl3/MeOH/IPA/water), as one of the appropriate solvent
systems for phenylpropanoid separation, as reported in the review
of strategies for solvent system selection in countercurrent separation.25 Therefore, we tested different ratios of the
two-phase solvent system of CHCl3/MeOH/IPA/water, listed
in Table 1. The suitable
range of K values was generally 0.5 ≤ K ≤ 2.0.24 The recommended
α value was >1.5.24 Based on the K value obtained by CHCl3/MeOH/IPA/water (3:2:2:3,
v/v/v/v), compound 1 eluted rapidly. Because the K values of compounds 2 and 3 obtained
by CHCl3/MeOH/IPA/water (3:1:2:4, v/v/v/v) and CHCl3/MeOH/IPA/water (4:3:3:4, v/v/v/v) were very similar and their
α values were close to 1, it was predicted that 2 and 3 could not be separated well. Finally, the optimum
solvent system comprising CHCl3/MeOH/IPA/water (5:2:2:4,
v/v/v/v) was determined to separate the target compounds.

2.3 CPC Separation and HPLC–DAD–ESI/MS
Analysis of CPC Peak Fraction
The ethyl acetate fraction
(200 mg) of the scaly bulbs of L. longiflorum was dissolved in a 1:1 (v/v) mixture (1 mL each) of the two-phase
solvent system (CHCl3/MeOH/IPA/water = 5:2:2:4, v/v/v/v).
The ascending mode was applied using the lower organic phase as the
stationary phase and the upper aqueous phase as the mobile phase.
The stationary phase retention of this system was 68%. The peak fractions
(I–V) were separated by CPC,
and the separation time was approximately 75 min (Figure 3). Individual peaks were collected
and analyzed. Compound 1 (2.9 mg) corresponded to the
peak fraction I; compound 4 (6.8 mg) corresponded to
the peak fraction II; compound 3 (3.1 mg) to the peak
fraction III; compound 2 (12.2 mg) to the peak fraction
IV; and compound 5 (6.2 mg) to the peak fraction V. Compounds 1–5 were obtained with purities of 75.8, 97.9, 66.5,
96.9, and 90.2% at 320 nm, based on HPLC–DAD analysis. The
HPLC chromatograms of compounds 1–5 are shown
in Figure 4.

2.5 DPP-IV Inhibitory Activity Evaluation
As a part of an ongoing search for new DPP-IV inhibitors from natural
products, DPP-IV inhibitory activities of five phenylpropanoids from L. longiflorum were evaluated. Among the different
isolates, compounds 2 and 5 inhibited DPP-IV
activity with IC50 values of 46.19 and 63.26 μM,
respectively, in a concentration-dependent manner (Figure 5). The IC50 of the
positive control sitagliptin was 0.071 ± 0.005 μM. Compounds 2 and 5 have biphenylpropanoid structures linked
via sugar, while inactive compounds 1, 3, and 4 are phenylpropanoidglyceryl glucosides and/or
phenylpropanoid glycerol. Although compounds 2 and 5 were relatively less active than the synthetic DPP-IV inhibitor,
sitagliptin, there have been several reports that naturally occurring
DPP-IV inhibitors also showed their mild activities.23,29−31

Figure 5 Effects of compounds 2 and 5 on DPP-IV
activity. Values are presented as the mean ± SD of three independent
experiments.

To the best of our knowledge,
3,6′-O-diferuloylsucrose
(2) has been reported to exhibit anti-inflammatory and
antitumor effects32 with inhibitory activity
against advanced glycation end products and aldose reductase.33 However, its DPP-IV potentials were investigated
for the first time in this study. In addition, 4-O-acetyl-3,6′-O-diferuloylsucrose (5) has never been associated with any biological activity. In a report,
evaluating the inhibitory activity of phenylpropanoid glycerols including
compounds 1–5 on the increased hepatic gluconeogenesis,
one of the symptoms of type II diabetes, and compounds 2–5, except for 1, showed insignificant activities.8 Therefore, these results may support further
investigation into exploring the potential for the development of
natural product-derived DPP-IV inhibitors through in silico, mechanism
of action, and in vivo studies.

3 Conclusions
This is the first report that demonstrated the isolation of five
phenylpropanoids including 1-O-p-coumaroyl-2-O-β-d-glucopyranosylglycerol
(regaloside D, 1), 3,6′-O-diferuloylsucrose
(2), 1-O-p-coumaroyl-2-O-β-d-glucopyranosyl-3-O-acetylglycerol (regaloside B, 3), 1-O-p-coumaroylglycerol (4), and 4-O-acetyl-3,6′-O-diferuloylsucrose
(5) from the scaly bulbs of L. longiflorum using CPC. In addition, the DPP-IV inhibitory activity of the extracts
and components of the scaly bulbs of L. longiflorum was evaluated in vitro. A two-phase solvent system comprising CHCl3/MeOH/IPA/water (5:2:2:4, v/v/v/v) in ascending mode was applied
for the one-step purification of these compounds with high purity.
Compounds 2 and 5 were identified as active
ingredients of the scaly bulbs of L. longiflorum, inhibiting the DPP-IV enzyme with IC50 values of 46.19
and 63.26 μM, respectively. Therefore, this study provides a
reference for the large-scale isolation of phenylpropanoids from the
scaly bulbs of L. longiflorum. Compounds 2 and 5 represent DPP-IV inhibitors.

4 Materials and Methods
4.1 General
CPC was
performed using the
Gilson CPC 250 system (Gilson Inc., Middleton, WI, USA) equipped with
a 250 mL rotor, a 10 mL sample loop, a Shimadzu LC-8A pump (Shimadzu,
Kyoto, Japan), and a Shimadzu SPD-10A UV/vis detector. Analytical
HPLC–DAD–ESIMS was carried out on an Agilent 1200 series
system and an Agilent 6120 quadrupole MS system (Agilent Technologies
Co., Santa Clara, CA, USA) equipped with a YMC-Triart C18 column (5
μm, 250 mm × 4.6 mm; YMC Co.) and ChemStation software.
The NMR experiments were performed with a JNM-ECA 500 MHz NMR instrument
(JEOL Ltd., Tokyo, Japan, tetramethylsilane as an internal standard)
and a 600 MHz Varian NMR spectrometer (VNS-600, Palo Alto, CA, USA).
All other chemicals and solvents used in this study were of analytical
grade.

4.2 Plant Material
The scaly bulbs of
the L. longiflorum hybrid (cv. White
Triumph) were harvested at the experimental farm, Advanced Radiation
Technology Institute, Korea Atomic Energy Research Institute (Jeongeup-si,
Jeollabuk-do, Korea) and collected in August 2017. This plant was
identified by Sang Hoon Kim, one of the co-authors of this study.
The scaly bulbs were dried using an air drying machine at a temperature
of 40 °C for 72 h. The voucher specimens (no. RB012) have been
deposited at the Advanced Radiation Technology Institute, Korea Atomic
Energy Research Institute.

4.3 Preparation of Crude Sample
The scaly
bulbs of L. longiflorum were hot-air
dried and weighed to 12 kg in dry weight. The dried sample was extracted
with methanol (3 × 15 L) overnight at room temperature. The solvent
was evaporated in vacuo to yield a methanol extract (447 g), which
was suspended in distilled water (1 L) and partitioned with n-hexane (3 × 2 L), chloroform (3 × 2 L), ethyl
acetate (5 × 3 L), and n-butanol (5 × 3
L), sequentially. Each solvent fraction was evaporated in vacuo to
yield fractions of n-hexane (53.6 g), chloroform
(5.8 g), ethyl acetate (18.0 g), and n-butanol (141.6
g).

4.4 Evaluation of Partition Coefficient (K) and Separation Factor (α)
The two-phase
solvent system was selected according to the partition coefficient
(K) of each target compound in the crude sample.
The K value was defined as the peak area of the target
compound in the stationary phase divided by the peak area of the target
compound in the mobile phase.16 The K value was determined using HPLC as follows: 1 mg of ethyl
acetate fraction was added to a 1.5 mL tube, followed by the addition
of 500 μL of each phase of the pre-equilibrated two-phase solvent
system. The tube was vigorously shaken for 1 min. After the two-phase
samples were completely equilibrated, 200 μL of each phase was
collected and analyzed by HPLC. The K values of target
compounds were obtained using the following equation: K = Aupper phase/Alower phase (A: peak area). The
separation factor (α) represents the ratio of the two K values and was obtained by dividing the K values of the two compounds (α = K1/K2, where K1 > K2).24

4.5 CPC Separation
CPC separation was
conducted with a biphasic solvent system composed of CHCl3/MeOH/IPA/water with a volume ratio 5:2:2:4. Each solvent was added
to a separation funnel and shaken vigorously. After equilibration,
the upper and lower phases were separated and degassed by sonication
for 30 min before use. To prepare the injection, the 200 mg crude
sample was dissolved in 1 mL of each phase. Depending on the phase
density, CPC has two operation modes. In this study, the lower phase
including chloroform was heavy, and was used as the stationary phase,
selecting the ascending mode. The column was first filled with the
stationary phase at a flow rate of 10 mL/min with a rotation speed
of 500 rpm, and the mobile phase was pumped into the column at the
same flow rate while the instrument was run at 1600 rpm. After reaching
a hydrostatic equilibrium, indicating the outflow of the mobile phase
from the column, the prepared sample solution was injected. The fractions
were collected by a fraction collector for 1 min (or 10 mL) in each
test tube and monitored using a UV detector at 320 nm.

4.6 HPLC–DAD–ESI/MS Analysis
The ethyl acetate-soluble
fraction and the CPC peak fractions were
weighed accurately and dissolved in MeOH at 1.0 mg/mL, followed by
filtration through a syringe (0.45 μm). The HPLC analysis was
performed using an YMC-Triart C18 column (5 μm, 250 × 4.6
mm; YMC Co., Kyoto, Japan) with binary gradient elution with water
(v/v, solvent A) and acetonitrile (v/v, solvent B): 0–40 min,
10–40% B; 40–42 min, 40%–100% B. The injection
volume was set to 10 μL and the flow rate was maintained at
0.8 mL/min. Chromatograms were acquired at 320 nm using the DAD detector.
The mass spectra were measured between m/z 100 and 1000 in the positive ionization mode (ESI+) at a scan rate of 1.06 s/cycles and monitored using a diode
array detector. The mass spectrometric conditions were as follows:
capillary voltage = 4000 V; drying gas flow = 10 L/min (N2); nebulizer pressure = 30 psi; and drying gas temperature = 350
°C.

4.7 DPP-IV Inhibitory Activity Assay
DPP-IV activity was analyzed using a DPP-IV inhibitor screening assay
kit (Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI, USA) according to the manufacturer’s
protocols. Briefly, the DDP assay buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0,
containing 100 nM NaCl and 1 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid) was
used as the assay solution. Human recombinant DPP-IV and its substrate,
namely, 5 mM H-Gly-Pro conjugated to aminomethylcoumarin (AMC), were
prepared in the same buffer. Diluted assay buffer (30 μL) and
diluted enzyme solution (10 μL) were added to a 96-well plate
containing 10 μL of the solvent (blank) or solvent-dissolved
test compounds. The reaction was initiated by adding 50 μL of
a diluted solution of the fluorogenic substrate. Cleavage of the peptide
bond by DPP-IV released the free AMC group. Fluorescence at an excitation
wavelength of 350 nm and an emission wavelength of 450 nm was monitored
using a plate reader (TECAN, Männedorf, Switzerland). The percent
inhibition was calculated as follows: ([DPP-IV level of vehicle-treated
control – DPP-IV level of test samples]/DPP-IV level of vehicle-treated
control) × 100. Subsequently, the 50% inhibitory concentration
(IC50) was calculated via a dose–response analysis
using GraphPad Prism software (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA, USA).
