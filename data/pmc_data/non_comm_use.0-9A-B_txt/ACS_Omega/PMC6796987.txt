Lead (Pb) pollution arising from
industrial and mining activities
has led to widespread environmental toxicity, particularly in South
Africa. Humans exposed to Pb are reported to suffer from detrimental
health impacts that can lead to fatalities. As such, there is an urgent
need to remediate Pb from the environment. In this study, we propose
the use of a Pb-specific recombinant fusion metalloprotein, rPbrD
surface-cross-linked onto calcium alginate nanoparticles (CANPs) for
the biosorption of Pb(II) from aqueous solution. The prepared biosorbents
were characterized using scanning electron microscopy, transmission
electron microscopy, and dynamic light scattering. Their ability to
biosorb soluble Pb(II) was determined by inductively coupled plasma
mass spectroscopy and their adsorption mechanism was described according
to the Langmuir, Freundlich, Temkin, and Dubinin–Radushkevich
adsorption isotherms. The rate of Pb uptake for bare CANPs and rPbrD-CANPs
at a concentration of 100 mg/L metal was 3.34 and 8.82 mg/g, respectively,
within 30 min. The adsorption data for the bare CANPs best fit the
Langmuir isotherm, whereas the adsorption data for rPbrD-CANPs best
fitted the Freundlich isotherm. Based on the sorption intensity (n) and the separation factor (RL), both biosorbents represent a favorable adsorption system. These
findings suggest that the proposed nanobiosorbent is a promising candidate
for the recovery of Pb ions present in high concentrations such as
acid mine drainage or industrial effluent.

==== Body
Introduction
Lead (Pb) toxicity is an environmental
concern with a global impact
on public health. Lead poisoning refers to the accumulation of the
metal in the body, over time resulting in organ dysfunction, especially
within the nervous system. It has caused permanent neurological damage
in over 15 million children from developing countries.1 An increase in industrialization and urbanization has contributed
to copious amounts of metals like Pb being discharged into natural
water resources; rendering it unfit for human consumption. In South
Africa, 40% of the population lives in rural settlements that depend
entirely upon ground and surface water for domestic use.2 However, metal exposure is not only limited to
communities in informal settlements but also the urban population
when they consume the home-grown fruits and vegetables, which are
sold as a source of income.3 Several reports
highlight the presence of Pb(II) in South African river systems exceeding
the acceptable limit of 10 μg/L.4 Fatoki and co-workers5 detected 240–1110
μg/L of Pb(II) in the Umtata River, Eastern Cape, while in the
Western Cape, 30–40 μg/L of Pb(II) was recorded in Eerste
River.6 Olujimi and co-workers7 reported an annual average of between 17.6 and
52.9 μg/L Pb(II) in the river systems of the Western Cape. Although
new policies, regulations, and legislations have been made to control
the decanting of industrial waste, ambiguities in the system still
remain.8 Humphries and co-workers9 suggested that although a natural wetland in
the Klip River, Gauteng acts as a sink for metals like Pb (source
of contamination—Central Witwatersrand Basin), increase in
contaminated discharge could compromise the wetland, itself becoming
a source of metal contamination that would lead to devastating effects
on the region’s water supply. Consequently, there is a focus
on the development of effective strategies to remove or reduce the
elevated concentrations of Pb(II) from wastewaters.

Remediation
of Pb(II) from wastewaters using bacterial cells has
been reviewed extensively10,11 as it offers a cheap
alternative to chemical treatments. Although biosorption may offer
high adsorption capacity and short reaction times, the system is inefficient
in targeting specific metal ions when present in a complex medium.
Peptides targeting specific metal ions (biopanning) have been attached
to bacterial cells for Pb(II) remediation.12,13 However, introducing modified bacterial cells into water bodies
is not yet feasible due to the uncertainty around their behavior in
the environment.

In this study, we report the development of
a novel nanobiosorbent
that exploits the Pb(II) binding properties of the bacterial protein
PbrD. PbrD is a metallochaperone found exclusively in Cupriavidus metallidurans CH3414 that binds Pb(II) intracellularly, thereby reducing
the cellular toxic effect of the metal at elevated concentrations.10 A recombinant form of PbrD (rPbrD) was immobilized
onto calcium alginate (CA) nanoparticles (CANPs) and assessed for
its ability to biosorb Pb(II) in vitro. Calcium alginate nanoparticles
afford stability to the biomolecule in terms of temperature and pH,15−17 enhance Pb(II) remediation,18−22 and are biodegradable.19,23 Herein, we report the
use of a synthetic protein-based nanobiosorbent to adsorb Pb(II) at
25 °C. Furthermore, we assess the theoretical adsorption properties
of the newly developed nanobiosorbent by the Langmuir, Freundlich,
Temkin, and Dubinin–Radushkevich (D–R) isotherms owing
to its application to remediate Pb(II) from wastewater.

Results and Discussion
Characterization
of rPbrD-CANPs
Electron Microscopy
Figure 1 shows the morphology and structure
of bare
CANPs and rPbrD-CANPs. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images for
CANPs (Figure 1a) and
rPbrD-CANPs (Figure 1b) reveal uniformly synthesized, monodispersed particles. Morphology
of CANPs was of spherical nature, whereas rPbrD-CANPs were amorphous
NPs. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) micrographs further confirmed
the formation of NPs with clear geometric boundaries. Bare CANPs with
the size ranging from 5 to 30 nm were observed (Figure 1c) while rPbrD-CANPs appeared larger, between
60 and 85 nm in diameter (Figure 1d). The larger diameter of the rPbrD-CANPs was expected
owing to the extended arm of glutaraldehyde and surface-cross-linked
protein. When compared to the bare CANPs, rPbrD-CANPs remained in
close proximity to each other. This can be attributed to the overall
surface charge as well as low particle dispersion from reduced sonication
that would otherwise lead to protein degradation.

Figure 1 SEM and corresponding
TEM images showing uniformly synthesized,
monodispersed spherical CANPs ranging from 5 to 30 nm (a, c) and rPbrD-CANPs
between 60 and 85 nm (b, d).

Protein Loading
For the synthesis of the nanobiosorbent,
two strategies used in the immobilization of rPbrD to the as-prepared
CANPs were evaluated to determine which resulted in more efficient
protein loading. When encapsulated within the CANPs, 66% of 5 μM
rPbrD protein was loaded. However, when rPbrD was surface-cross-linked
to the CANPs, 72% protein loading efficiency was achieved. The lower
loading efficiency could be as a result of smaller pore size within
the CANPs, which prevented the entry of rPbrD for binding.24,25 When compared to encapsulation, chemical cross-linking has been
noted to not only improve thermal stability but also protein loading.25 All further characterization of the nanobiosorbent
was performed with surface-cross-linked rPbrD-CANPs.

To improve
the protein loading efficiency on surface-cross-linked CANPs, two
additional parameters were assessed: the concentration of rPbrD and
size of CANPs. Figure 2a shows that increasing the concentration of rPbrD from 5 to 40 μM
did not increase loading efficiency. Similar trends were observed
when the cellulase enzyme was immobilized onto calcium alginate beads,17 and bovine serum albumin (BSA) was encapsulated
in chitosan nanoparticles.15 Both studies
reported that an increase in protein concentration decreased the immobilization
efficiency. The decrease in loading efficiency may occur due to the
exclusion of binding to inner aldehydic groups by proteins diffusing
from bulk solutions to the outer aldehydic chains, which are usually
the first to be encountered.26 A high protein
concentration leads to rapid immobilization resulting in partial or
total blockage of the pore. Another contributing factor could be that
at higher concentrations, recombinant proteins may precipitate out
of solution becoming unavailable for immobilization.

Figure 2 Protein loading efficiency
(%). Graphs showing protein loading
efficiency when different concentrations of rPbrD protein are cross-linked
to CANPs (a), and different concentrations of CaCl2 are
used to vary the size of CANPs cross-linked to 5 μM rPbrD (b).

In addition, changing the particle size (diameter)
may affect the
protein loading efficiency. Therefore, 5 μM rPbrD was loaded
onto CANPs formed with different concentrations of CaCl2. An increase in CaCl2 concentration resulted in a corresponding
increase in particle size. However, as the size of CANPs increased,
a decrease in the protein loading efficiency was noted (Figure 2b). These findings suggested
a reduction in the surface area of NPs and therefore reduced the number
of protein binding sites. Similarly, a decrease in the CANP size (18
mM CaCl2) slightly reduced the protein loading efficiency.
In this study, CANPs synthesized with 22 mM CaCl2 showed
the highest loading efficiency of 74% and hence was characterized
further and used for downstream applications. The stability of rPbrD
cross-linked onto CANPs was monitored by measuring the protein concentration
in the supernatant of the stored samples over a period of 7 days.
There was no appearance of degeneration or leakage of the rPbrD protein
in the supernatant, indicating the stability of the system.

Particle
Size Distribution and ζ Potential
Particle
size and surface charge of NPs are two important factors in their
application due to their effect on dissolution. Dynamic light scattering
(DLS) data indicated the particle size distribution of bare CANPs
to be between 12 nm (±1.29) and 44 nm (±0.46) with an average
polydispersity index (PDI) of 0.288 and rPbrD-CANPs to be between
50 nm (±2.57) and 140 nm (±1.95) with an average PDI of
0.326 (Figure 3a,c, n = 3). The peak of high intensity shows a relatively narrow
size distribution typical of monodispersed NPs. The DLS data correlates
with the data obtained from SEM images.

Figure 3 Size distributions of
bare CANPs (a, b) and rPbrD-CANPs (c, d)
showing the formulation of monodispersed particles with a mean diameter
of approximately 12–40 and 50–140 nm, respectively.
Error bars represent the standard deviation (SD) from triplicate treatments.

The surface charge of NPs determines its ability
to interact with
other molecules. In this study, an average ζ potential of −26
mV (±0.85) and −31.1 (±0.3) were recorded for bare
CANPs and rPbrD-CANPs, respectively (Figure 4a,b, n = 3). The overall
negative surface charge is due to the high content of carboxyl and
hydroxyl groups of alginate.27 Immobilization
of rPbrD to the surface of the CANPs results in increased particle
stability. In addition, an increase in the ζ potential for rPbrD-CANPs
was indicative of the success of protein immobilization by surface-cross-linking.
These results suggest a stable colloidal system that would allow interaction
with Pb(II) cations.

the formation of stable NPs.

Biosorption Efficiency of rPbrD-CANPs
To determine
the biosorption efficiency of the nanobiosorbent, both bare CANPs
and rPbrD-CANPs were incubated separately in the presence of increasing
concentrations of Pb(II) from 0.001 to 100 mg/L. The supernatant was
analyzed using inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy (ICP-MS)
to indirectly detect the amount of bound Pb(II). Additionally, control
samples containing the same concentration range of Pb(II) were prepared
without the biosorbent and analyzed with ICP-MS. The control showed
no change in the concentration of Pb(II). Figure 5 shows that the biosorption efficiency of
rPbrD-CANPs increased (44–99%) with an increase in Pb(II) concentration
(0.001–100 mg/L). At low concentrations of Pb(II), there is
a surplus of active binding sites as the ratio of binding sites to
metal concentration is high. These binding sites may include the carboxylate
(−COO) and hydroxyl (OH) groups characteristic of CA particles20 as well as the cysteine residues of the protein
rPbrD.10 A similar trend, where biosorption
efficiency increased with an increase in the initial Pb concentration,
was noted in other biosorption studies.28,29 This pattern
may be attributed to an increased driving force for mass transfer,
causing higher collisions between the sorbate and biosorbent,30,31 thereby leading to an enhanced uptake of Pb(II).

Figure 5 Rate of metal uptake
(mg/g) and corresponding biosorption efficiency
(%) of bare CANPs and rPbrD-CANPs in the presence of increasing concentrations
of Pb(II). An increase in the rate of uptake for both CANPs and rPbrD-CANPs
was observed with an increase in the Pb concentration. The biosorption
efficiency for bare CANPs gradually decreased after 1 mg/L, whereas
rPbrD-CANPs maintained its Pb(II) binding efficiency up to 100 mg/L
Pb. Error bars represent the standard deviation from triplicate treatments.

In addition to the apparent increase in the biosorption
efficiency,
the rate of Pb uptake for rPbrD-CANPs also significantly increased
from 3.82 × 10–5 to 8.82 mg/g with an increase
in the Pb concentration (0.001–100 mg/L). This trend is attributed
to the increased electrostatic attractions and mass transfer resistances
between the Pb ions and the metal-binding sites.32 However, since this is the first study to report on a nanobiosorbent
constructed from a recombinant protein, a true comparison with other
reported nanobiosorbents is not possible.

Bare CANPs also showed
an increase in Pb(II) uptake from 0.001
mg/L (74%) to 0.1 mg/L (97%) until saturation was obtained. Thereafter,
the biosorption efficiency began to gradually decrease dropping to
37.85% at 100 mg/L Pb(II). The decrease in metal sorption at higher
concentrations of Pb is attributed to the fully occupied metal-binding
sites, where the biosorbent has reached a state of equilibrium. At
this stage, there is constant sorption–desorption of metals
ions, and therefore no further decrease in the residual metal concentration
is observed unless the bound metals are desorbed by a change in solution
parameters. This trend is typical of the adsorption Langmuir isotherm
where the metals occupy the finite number of vacant adsorption sites
in a monolayer formation, i.e., one metal ion per metal-binding site.27 These results are further confirmed with the
adsorption isotherm data obtained for CANPs in this study. Similar
results were obtained by Khezri and co-workers,19 who showed a 99% adsorption of bare CANPs in the presence
of 25 mg/L Pb(NO3)2 and also discovered that
as the initial metal ion concentration increased, the biosorption
of Pb(II) decreased owing to the limited number of binding sites on
CANPs.

As expected, these results showed that both CANPs and
rPbrD-CANPs
are capable of binding Pb. However, when comparing the rate of uptake
between the biosorbents, rPbrD-CANPs significantly biosorbed [Table 1, p < 0.05 analysis of variance (ANOVA)] more metal per gram of biomass
compared to CANPs for all concentrations tested except at 0.001 mg/L.
The increase in the rate of metal uptake in rPbrD-CANPs is due to
the additional metal-binding sites available on rPbrD (cysteine residues)
and its hypothesized specificity for binding Pb(II). At the highest
concentration of Pb tested (100 mg/L), rPbrD-CANPs biosorbed almost
all of the metals (99%) at a rate of 8.82 mg/g of nanobiosorbent,
whereas CANPs biosorbed only 38% at a rate of 3.34 mg/g nanobiosorbent.
A significant difference in the rate of Pb uptake between CANPs and
rPbrD-CANPs was observed for all concentrations tested, except at
a concentration of 0.01 mg/L, where the rate of Pb uptake did not
differ significantly (Table 1, p < 0.05 single-factor ANOVA). These
findings suggest that while CANPs are able to remove Pb from aqueous
solutions when present in low concentrations, adding rPbrD to the
CANPs significantly enhances the biosorption efficiency even under
high concentrations of the metal. This is ideal not only for South
African natural water systems currently contaminated with Pb concentrations
ranging from 17 to >1000 μg/L as mentioned earlier but also
globally in countries like India, China, Mexico, and Brazil amongst
others.33

The findings from the present study show that surface-cross-linked
rPbrD-CANPs are good nanobiosorbents for Pb(II) that maintain high
biosorption efficiency even in the presence of elevated concentrations
of the metal. Consequently, the nanobiosorbent would be suitable to
recover Pb ions from wastewater.

The binding of Pb(II) to rPbrD-CANPs
was further confirmed by performing
SEM with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) analysis on the
washed nanobiosorbent pellet before (Figure 6a) and after incubation (Figure 6b) with the metal. The EDS
spectra of rPbrD-CANPs post-biosorption showed a strong signal for
Pb and weak signals for carbon (C), chloride (Cl), and oxygen (O)
elements (Figure 6b).
The peaks of Pb originated from the successful binding of Pb(II) onto
rPbrD-CANPs while those of C, Cl, and O were attributed to the formulation
of the CANPs itself.

Adsorption Isotherms
Adsorption isotherms were applied
to understand the adsorption mechanism and compare the Pb(II) binding
properties of rPbrD-CANPs to that of bare CANPs. For each isotherm,
the values of the adsorption parameters and their respective linear
regression line (R2) were calculated from
the linear plots (Figure 7) prepared using the adsorption equilibrium data. The results
of the adsorption isotherm values are presented in Table 2.

Based on linear regression, bare
CANPs best fit the Langmuir isotherm
suggesting a monolayer formation of Pb(II). This indicates that the
surface of CANPs contains a finite number of binding sites.19 The theoretical assumption correlates to the
experimental data, where bare CANPs eventually reached saturation
(at 0.1 mg/L Pb) and no further adsorption could occur. The linear
regression data obtained for rPbrD-CANPs best fit the Freundlich isotherm,
suggesting that Pb(II) binds in a multilayer formation, which is indicative
of a nonrestrictive and exponential form of binding. In multilayer
adsorption, the number of Pb(II) molecules is not necessarily identical
to the exact number of active sites on the adsorbent surface due to
the exponential adsorption of Pb ions, which occur due to interaction
with other Pb molecules.34 As a result,
the experimental data showed the complete removal of Pb(II) (100 mg/L)
within 30 min when using a concentration of 11 g/L of nanobiosorbent
(rPbrD-CANPs). Furthermore, adding rPbrD to the CANPs enhanced the
maximum rate of adsorption of bare CANPs experimentally from 3.34
to 8.82 mg/g (rPbrD-CANPs). These findings are also supported by the
maximum adsorption data (Qs) obtained
from the Dubinin–Radushkevich model with values for bare CANPs
of 123.53 mg/g and rPbrD-CANPs of 598.60 mg/g of Pb(II)/g biosorbent,
respectively. The differences between the adsorption capacity of bare
CANPs and rPbrD-CANPs may be attributed to the different surface adsorption
properties and particle size.20,27,28 The surface properties of rPbrD-CANPs differ from that of the CANPs
due to the addition of rPbrD, which provides additional functional
groups (amino acids) to the biosorbent. This changes the overall ionic
strength and the surface charge of the biosorbent. Additionally, an
increase in the surface area (size) of a particle consequently increases
the number of binding sites on the biosorbent, thereby increasing
its ability to interact/bind to Pb ions. On the other hand, the hypothesized
maximum adsorption capacity values obtained from Langmuir and Freundlich
isotherms (qmax and Kf) were relatively low (<1 mg/g). Due to the immense
differences between the adsorption capacity values for all isotherms,
no approximate value can be stated. Based on the Langmuir isotherm,
the separation factor (RL) for each Pb(II)
concentration used in this study was calculated and shown in Table 3. The RL values for both bare CANP and rPbrD-CANPs fell in the
range 0 > RL > 1, indicating a favorable
adsorption. Based on the Freundlich isotherm, the adsorption intensity
(1/n) indicates the binding strength between the
biosorbent and Pb(II). The exponent values showed 1/n < 1 (0.84) for bare CANPs indicating a normal adsorption, whereas
1/n > 1 (2.06) for rPbrD-CANPs indicating a cooperative
adsorption. Normal adsorption is usually favored by monolayer coverage,
whereas cooperative adsorption is favored by a multilayer coverage.
Furthermore, the n value should lie between 1 and
10, as obtained from the Freundlich data for both sorbents, then the
adsorption process is favorable.35 The
Temkin isotherm constant B explicitly indicates the maximum binding
energy or the heat of adsorption that occurs with the coverage of
the nanobiosorbent.36 Based on this data,
the values obtained for bare CANPs (248.3 J/mol) and rPbrD-CANPs (972.7
J/mol) showed that the adsorption process is exothermic, representing
a physical adsorption system. Additionally, the calculated value of E (kJ/mol) obtained from the D–R isotherm was approximately
1 kJ/mol for bare CANPs and rPbrD-CANPs also, indicating a physisorption
process.37 However, based on the low linear
regression line for rPbrD-CANPs (R2 =
0.3) obtained from the Langmuir and Temkin isotherm, no conclusive
outcome can be made. Nevertheless, since rPbrD-CANPs indicated a multilayer
coverage, and based on the E value from the D–R
isotherm, the interaction between Pb(II) and the proposed sorbent
is most likely through a physisorption process.

Conclusions
In this paper, we report
the synthesis and characterization of
a novel recombinant protein-based lead (Pb) biosorbent for potential
application in wastewater treatment. The metallochaperone PbrD was
overexpressed and surface-cross-linked to CANPs to form spherical,
monodispersed particles with an average diameter of 80 nm. The negative
surface charge of the nanobiosorbent indicated a stable colloidal
system with the ability to bind positively charged Pb(II). Although
bare CANPs were able to bind Pb(II), the rPbrD-CANP nanobiosorbent
showed enhanced uptake of the metal (99.9%) at a rate of 8.82 mg/g
biosorbent even in the presence of elevated concentrations. The adsorption
by rPbrD-CANPs best fitted the Freundlich and Dubinin–Radushkevich
isotherms indicating that Pb(II) binding occurred by physical sorption
in a multilayer formation. Further development of the nanobiosorbent
will include optimizing its performance for real water samples where
rPbrD protein is likely to preferentially remediate Pb ions. The nanobiosorbent
offers several advantages over traditional biosorbents. It does not
produce secondary waste, is biodegradable, and offers increased stability,
specificity, sensitivity, and miniaturization of the process. Its
incorporation into a small volume portable membrane filter or alternative
incorporation into existing wastewater treatment systems could provide
a suitable treatment strategy for the recovery of Pb(II) present from
1 μg/L to 100 mg/L, which covers the variability of metal concentration
in wastewater effluent.

Materials and Methods
Materials
Sodium
alginate (SA, low viscosity grade;
15–25 cP, 1% H2O), calcium chloride (CaCl2), glutaraldehyde (70%), and lead nitrate (Pb(NO3)2) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Missouri) and used without
further purification. The experimental procedures were performed at
ambient temperature (∼25 °C) unless otherwise stated.
All solutions were prepared with distilled water obtained from the
Elix Essential Water Purification System (Merck, Germany).

Preparation
of Recombinant PbrD Protein (rPbrD)
The
PbrD protein was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) cells carrying the constructed vector pPET32Xa/LIC-pbrD. This vector was constructed to carry the full-length pbrD gene fused to an N-terminal Trx·Tag, His·Tag,
and STag; the resulting fusion protein is hereafter referred to as
rPbrD. Optimal expression of rPbrD (∼50 kDa) was achieved at
37 °C, 5 h post-induction with 1 mM isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside. Overexpressed rPbrD was purified by Ni-NTA
affinity chromatography under denaturing conditions using 8 M urea.
Purified protein (>85%) was eluted in elution buffer (50 mM NaH2PO4, 300 mM NaCl, 8 M urea, 400 mM imidazole, pH
8) and refolded by dialysis into buffer containing reduced concentrations
of urea and dithiothreitol (DTT) (50 mM Tris, 0.5 M l-arginine,
1 M urea, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mM DTT, pH 8). The refolded protein
was further dialyzed into phosphate-buffered saline buffer [containing
0.5 M l-arginine, 1 mM DTT, 10% glycerol (v/v), pH 8] and
used for immobilization onto CANPs.

Preparation of CANPs
Calcium alginate nanoparticles
were synthesized according to the method described by Daemi and Barikani23 with slight modification. A solution of 0.06%
(w/v) SA was prepared in distilled water under constant agitation
and heated to 60 °C until the polymer was completely dissolved.
Simultaneously, 22 mM CaCl2 solution was prepared by dissolving
in distilled water and titrated into the SA solution at a flow rate
of 0.05 mL/min using a peristaltic pump (EP-1 Econo Pump, Bio-Rad)
under continuous homogenization. The solution was further agitated
for 1 h to achieve the complete formation of the NPs. The homogenized
solution was centrifuged at 15 000g for 10
min (Heraeus Multifuge X1R Centrifuge, Thermo-Fisher Scientific) to
remove impurities. The pellet was reconstituted in 10 mL distilled
water and pulse-sonicated with three cycles of 15 s each at 50% amplitude
(Q125 sonicator, Qsonica) for even dispersion of prepared NPs.

Preparation
of rPbrD-CANPs
Purified rPbrD was either
encapsulated within or surface-cross-linked to the CANPs using glutaraldehyde
as a cross-linker.

Preparation of Encapsulated rPbrD-CANPs
Separate solutions
of 0.06% (w/v) SA and 22 mM CaCl2 were prepared as described
earlier. Glutaraldehyde solution (0.5%) was added to the dissolved
SA solution and agitated for 30 min at room temperature. Thereafter,
5 μM rPbrD protein was added to the solution and further agitated
for 30 min to allow maximum binding of the protein. To form nanoparticles,
prepared CaCl2 solution was titrated into the polymer solution
containing rPbrD as described earlier and was further agitated for
1 h. The homogenized solution was centrifuged at 15 000g for 10 min to remove impurities, and the supernatant containing
unbound protein was quantified to determine protein loading efficiency
using the Qubit protein assay kit together with the Qubit quantification
platform fluorometer (Thermo Scientific). Pre-diluted bovine serum
albumin (BSA) standards were used to calibrate the Qubit fluorometer
prior to protein quantification.

Preparation of Surface-Cross-Linked
rPbrD-CANPs
Calcium
alginate nanoparticles were prepared as described earlier. Glutaraldehyde
solution (0.5%) was added to the prepared CANPs and agitated for 30
min. A final concentration of 5 μM rPbrD protein was added to
the solution and further agitated for 30 min. The surface-cross-linked
CANPs were purified by centrifugation at 15 000g for 10 min, and the protein loading efficiency was determined using
the Qubit protein assay kit together with the Qubit Quantification
Platform fluorometer (Thermo Scientific) as previously described.
The amount of protein loaded on surface-cross-linked CANPs was found
to be consistently higher in replicate preparations than for encapsulated
CANPs. Subsequently, further development of the nanobiosorbent was
based on the surface-cross-linked method to prepare rPbrD-CANPs.

Protein Loading Efficiency of rPbrD-CANPs
To obtain
maximal protein loading efficiency of rPbrD onto the CANPs, protein
concentration and nanoparticle size were varied. Several concentrations
of the protein (5, 10, 20, and 40 μM) were surface-cross-linked
to the as-prepared CANPs and incubated for 30 min. The solution was
centrifuged at 15 000g for 10 min, and the
concentration of the unbound protein in the supernatant was quantified
using the Qubit Quantification Platform fluorometer (Thermo Scientific)
as previously described. Alternatively, CANPs of variable sizes were
prepared using different concentrations of CaCl2 (18, 26,
30, and 36 mM) with a standard concentration of 5 μM rPbrD and
evaluated for protein loading. All samples were prepared in a minimum
of triplicates, and the results reported are representative of the
mean ± SD.

Characterization of CANPs and rPbrD-CANPs
Scanning
Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Energy-Dispersive X-ray
Spectroscopy (EDS)
Bare and rPbrD-CANP samples (10 μL)
were mounted onto a carbon-coated aluminum stub and placed in a desiccator
to dry for 24 h. The prepared stubs were then sputter-coated twice
with carbon and once with gold palladium and analyzed using the FEI
Nova NanoLab 600 FEG-SEM/FIB (FEI) operated at 30 kV coupled to the
EDS. Samples were prepared in triplicates, and images were recorded
in a minimum of triplicates.

Transmission Electron Microscopy
(TEM)
Twenty microliters
of bare CANPs or rPbrD-CANPs were placed onto a copper mesh grid and
dried at room temperature for 24 h. TEM measurements were performed
on an FEI Tecnai T12 instrument (FEI) operating at 120 kV.

Particle
Size Distribution and ζ Potential
Dynamic
light scattering (DLS) for particle size distribution and ζ
potential measurements was carried out on a Zen 3600 Laser Particle
Size Analyzer (Malvern Instruments). Samples were pulse-sonicated
at a low amplitude of 15%, and 1 mL sample was transferred into a
sterile cuvette for analysis at a wavelength of 532 nm. All measurements
were performed at 25 °C. For each preparation, an average of
three separate measurements was reported, and the results are representative
of the mean ± SD.

Pb Binding Assay with CANPs and rPbrD-CANPs
Biosorption
studies were conducted using 11 g/L of CANPs and rPbrD-CANPs, respectively.
The biosorbents were incubated separately with increasing concentrations
of Pb(NO3)2 solution (pH 8) ranging from 0.001
to 100 mg/L for 30 min under constant agitation (150 rpm) to facilitate
Pb(II) binding. The samples were then centrifuged at 24 000g for 20 min. The supernatant containing unbound Pb(II)
was collected, adjusted with 1% nitric acid, and analyzed using an
Agilent 7900 induction coupled plasma mass spectrometer (ICP-MS, 208Isotope) (Agilent Technologies, Inc.) at the Council for
Scientific and Industrial Research (South Africa) to indirectly detect
the concentration of bound Pb(II). Appropriate controls using Pb(NO3)2 solutions of similar concentrations (0.001–100
mg/L) without the addition of nanoparticles were included. The adsorption
experiments were performed in triplicate, and an average of three
measurements are reported. The percentage of Pb removal (biosorption
efficiency) and the adsorption capacity (Qe) (mg/g) were determined using eqs 1 and 2,38 respectively 1   2  where Ci is the
initial metal concentration (mg/L), Ce is the residual metal concentration (mg/L), V is
the solution volume (L), and w is the amount of adsorbent
in solution (g).

Statistical Analysis
Statistical
hypothesis testing
was performed on the biosorption data (rate of metal uptake) using
the statistical program R, version 3.4.3. The single-factor ANOVA
analysis was used to compare the rate of Pb uptake between CANPs and
rPbrD-CANPs for each concentration evaluated in this study. All experiments
were performed in triplicate to ensure statistical accuracy. A statistical
difference was considered significant when the p-value
(α-level) is ≤ 0.05 (95% confidence).

Adsorption
Isotherm
Modeling experimental adsorption
data of new biosorbents is essential to provide a proper understanding
and interpretation of the adsorption mechanisms they follow. Consequently,
their commercial potential and application feasibility39 can be evaluated. Therefore, the four frequently
reported adsorption isotherms (Langmuir, Freundlich, Temkin, and Dubinin–Radushkevich)
were used to model the adsorption mechanism of both bare and rPbrD-CANPs
in the presence of Pb(II) for the purpose of this study. However,
it is crucial to apprise that the data obtained from these isotherms
are only theoretical and not experimental and therefore are purely
descriptive and used as a guide for downstream application.40 The following summarizes the different adsorption
isotherms, linear equations, and adsorption properties, which were
applied using the adsorption equilibrium data from the biosorption
study.

Langmuir Isotherm
The Langmuir adsorption isotherm
was initially developed to study the gas–solid-phase adsorption
onto activated carbon.41 This isotherm
depicts a homogenous sorbent surface containing a limited number of
metal-binding sites that are similar in size and shape. If the experimental
data best fit the Langmuir isotherm, then the following is predicted:
Pb(II) forms a monolayer coverage on the surface of CANPs or rPbrD-CANPs
and no further adsorption occurs. The isotherm further predicts the
separation factor based on the following: if RL >1 indicates unfavorable adsorption, if RL = 1 indicates linear adsorption, and if RL 0 < RL< 1 then it
is favorable and if RL = 0 then it is
an irreversible sorption.

The adsorption parameters (Qmax and KL) and
the separation factor (RL) were determined
from the slope and intercept of the 1/Ce versus 1/Qe plot based on the linearized eqs 3 and 4(36) 3   4  where Qe is the
amount of Pb adsorbed per gram of the sorbent at equilibrium, Qm is the maximum adsorption capacity (mg/g), C0 is the initial metal concentration, KL is the Langmuir equilibrium constant (mg/L),
and RL is the equilibrium/separation factor.

Freundlich Isotherm
The Freundlich adsorption isotherm
determines the empirical relationship between the amount of gas adsorbed
per gram of biosorbent at a specific pressure and temperature.42 This isotherm depicts a heterogeneous sorbent
surface that binds metal ions in a nonrestrictive manner until saturation
pressure is reached. If the experimental data best fit the Freundlich
isotherm, then the following is predicted: Pb(II) forms a multilayer
coverage on the surface of CANPs or rPbrD-CANPs indicative of the
exponential distribution of Pb(II). The isotherm further predicts
the adsorption intensity based on the following: n = 1 indicates a more heterogeneous surface, 1/n < 1 indicates normal adsorption, and 1/n >1
indicates cooperative adsorption. The adsorption parameters (Kf and n) were determined from
the slope and intercept of the log Qe versus log Ce plot based on the
linearized equation presented as eq 5(37) 5  where Kf is the
Freundlich adsorption constant (mg/g) relating to the bonding energy
and n is the adsorption intensity between Pb and
sorbent.

Temkin Isotherm
The Temkin adsorption
model considers
the effects of indirect adsorbate–adsorbate interactions during
the adsorption process and best fits with a monolayer coverage. Considering
only the intermediate ion concentrations, the model assumes that as
metal ions bind and cover the surface of the biosorbent, the heat
of adsorption would decline linearly rather than logarithmically.43 If the experimental data best fit the Temkin
isotherm, then the following is predicted: a positive B (heat) value
would indicate that Pb(II) binds to CANPs or rPbrD-CANPs in an exothermic
process, whereas a negative value would indicate an endothermic process.
The adsorption parameters (At and Bt) were determined from the slope and intercept
of the Qe versus ln Ce plot based on the linearized equation as presented in eq 6 and the heat of the adsorption
(B) was determined from eq 7(35) 6   7  where R is the Universal
gas constant [8.314 J/(mol k)], T is the absolute
temperature in kelvin (298 K), At is the
equilibrium binding constant, Bt is the
Temkin isotherm constant related to the heat of sorption, and B is the constant related to heat of sorption (J/mol).

Dubinin–Radushkevich isotherm
The Dubinin–Radushkevich
(D–R) adsorption isotherm is an empirical isotherm which indicates
the sorption energy (BDR) distribution
between metal ions and the biosorbent.44 The physisorption prediction best fits a multilayer coverage displaying
van der Waals forces of interactions, whereas the chemisorption process
best fits monolayer coverage displaying covalent bond formation.45 If the experimental data best fit the D–R
isotherm, then the following is predicted: If a low enthalpy (<20
kJ) is measured, then the nature of bonding between Pb(II) and CANPs
or rPbrD-CANPs is a physisorption process. Similarly, a high enthalpy
(>200 kJ) would depict a chemisorption process. The adsorption
parameters
(Qs and Kad) were determined from the slope and intercept of the ln Qe versus ε2 plot based on the
linearized equation as presented in eqs 8–1046 8   9   10  where ε is the Polanyi potential, Qs is the theoretical saturation capacity (mg/g), Kad is the D–R adsorption energy constant
(mol2/kJ2), and BDR is the isotherm constant related to the mean free sorption energy.
