Five new guaiane dimers, xylopidimers
A–E (1–5), were isolated and identified
from the roots of Xylopia vielana.
The structures of 1–5 were elucidated by spectroscopic
analysis and further confirmed
by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. On the basis of the results of
single-crystal X-ray analysis, 1–5 showed different
carbon skeletons. Among these compounds, the unique connecting patterns
of 1 and 2 caused significant differences
on their carbon skeletons, which have not been reported. Moreover, 3–5 were also three new guaiane dimers. Among these
compounds, 4 exhibited potent inhibitory activity against
the production of nitric oxide with an IC50 value of 4.59
μM in RAW264.7 cells stimulated by lipopolysaccharide.

==== Body
Introduction
The genus Xylopia, which is one
member of the family Annonaceae, contains about 160 species all over
the world. Besides, only one species, Xylopia vielana, of this genus occurs in China.1 On the
basis of previous research studies, several dimeric guaianes have
been continuously identified from this species.2,6,7 However, all previous research studies were
only focus on the aerial part of this plant.8 In addition, some previous studies proved that some species from
this genus showed potential bioactivities about hypotensive, diuretic,
antibacterial, antifungal, and antioxidant effects.3−5 These previous
results highly motivated us to search for more novel compounds with
promising bioactivities from the other parts of X.
vielana, which resulted in five new guaiane dimers,
xylopidimers A–E (1–5) and one known guaiane
dimer, vielanin A (6) (Figure 1), which is isolated and identified from
the roots of X. vielana. Among these
compounds, 1 and 2 exhibited two novel connecting
patterns. The 4,5-linked exo-Diels–Alder adducts between two
guaiane moieties of 2 were first reported by this research.
In this paper, the structural identification and the inhibitory activities
against the production of nitric oxide in RAW264.7 cells of these
six guaiane dimers were described, as well.

Figure 1 Chemical structure of 1–6.

Results and Discussion
Xylopidimer A (1), [α]D20 −23.2 (c 0.109,
MeOH), was obtained as colorless prismatic crystals. The molecular
formula of 1 was found to be C30H36O4 (HRESIMS [M + Na+] at m/z 483.2519; calcd 483.2506), requiring 13 degrees
of unsaturation. The structure of 1 was deduced by NMR
analysis and further confirmed by single-crystal X-ray diffraction,
which indicates that it was a guaiane dimer (Figure 2).9 The infrared
(IR) spectrum indicated the presence of methyl groups (2967 cm–1) and carbonyl groups (1773 cm–1).

Figure 2 X-ray structure of 1.

From analyses of the 1H and 13C NMR
spectra
of 1, together with the examination of HSQC and HMBC
experiments, 30 carbon signals of the 13C NMR spectrum
were identified as eight CH3, four CH2, four
CH, and 14 quaternary carbons (involving four carbonyl groups, two
sp3, and eight sp2 carbons) (Table S1, Supporting Information). The planar structure
of 1 was constructed by detailed analyses of 1H–1H COSY and HMBC spectra (Figure 1).

First, the moiety 1b was confirmed
by determining C-5′ (δc 172.4) because of
its uncommonly high chemical shift caused
by conjugation to a carbonyl group and the ring tension. The HMBC
cross-peaks from H-2′ to C-1′/C-5′ and from H-15′
to C-1′/C-3′/C-4′/C-5′ suggested the appearance
of a five-membered ring (Figure 3). Moreover, a heptatomic ring was connected to this
five-membered ring at C-1′ and C-5′ by analyses of the
HMBC cross-peaks from H-6′ to C-5′/C-7′ and from
H-9′ to C-1′/C-8′/C-10′ (Figure 3). Additionally, two methyl
groups were connected to C-11′, which was connected to C-7′,
and were confirmed by observing the HMBC cross-peaks from H-12′
to C-7′/C-11′ and from H-13′ to C-7′/C-11′
(Figure 3). What is
more, two other methyl groups were connected to C-4′ and C-10′
by observing the HMBC cross-peaks from H-14′ to C-10′
and from H-15′ to C-4′, respectively (Figure 3). On the basis of these evidences,
the moiety 1b was confirmed as a guaiane moiety. Similar to moiety
1b, moiety 1a was also assigned as a guaiane moiety with the aid of
key HMBC cross-peaks. Therefore, compound 1 was elucidated
as a dimeric guaiane.

Figure 3 Chemical structure and selected NMR correlations of 1.

The connection between moiety
1a and moiety 1b through two direct
C–C bonds (C-2 to C-2′ and C-4 to C-1′) was established
by the key HMBC cross-peaks from H-15 to C-1′ combined with
the 1H–1H COSY correlations of H-2/H-2′.
This connecting pattern was probably caused by the Diels–Alder
[4 + 2] cycloaddition of two guaiane moieties as the dienophile and
diene themselves (Figure 3) (Scheme 1). This connecting pattern was also further confirmed by the Cu Kα
X-ray crystallographic analyses (Figure 2).9 Besides, this
connecting pattern is unique and has not been reported previously.

Scheme 1 Proposed Biogenetic Pathway for Xylopidimers A–E (1–5)
The relative configurations
of 1 were identified by
the key NOE correlations from the NMR spectra. The key NOE correlations
of H3-14/H-2′, H3-15/H-2′, and
H3-14′/H-2′ indicated that they are in the
same face and were assigned as α-oriented, whereas the correlations
of H-2/H-10 place them on the opposite side and assigned as β-oriented
(Figure 3). In order
to further confirm this configuration, it was necessary to conduct
a Cu Kα X-ray diffraction experiment. After trying several solvent
systems, the single crystal of 1 was obtained from methanol/water
(4:1). The single-crystal X-ray data unambiguously deduced the structure
of 1, and its absolute configuration was also showed
in the single-crystal X-ray data as 2S, 4R, 10R, 1′S, 2′S,
and 10′R (Figure 2).9

Xylopidimer B (2), [α]D20 −19.2 (c 0.102,
MeOH), was obtained as colorless prismatic crystals. The molecular
formula of 2 was found to be C30H36O4 (HRESIMS [M + Na+] at m/z 483.2515; calcd 483.2506), requiring 13 degrees
of unsaturation. The structure of 2 was deduced by NMR
analysis and further confirmed by single-crystal X-ray diffraction,
which indicates that it was a guaiane dimer (Figure 4).10 The IR spectrum
indicated the presence of methyl groups (2964 cm–1) and carbonyl groups (1777 cm–1).

Figure 4 X-ray structure of 2.

Extensive interpretation of the 1H, 13C NMR, 1H–1H
COSY, and HMBC spectra showed that 2 possessed the guaiane
moiety unit similar to those of 1 but possibly had a
different linkage type for two moieties.
The key HMBC cross-peaks from H-15 to C-4′ and from H-15′
to C-4, combined with the HMBC cross-peak from H-2 to C-5′,
indicated that these two guaiane moieties were linked via two different
C–C single bonds (C-2 to C-5′ and C-4 to C-4′)
(Figure 5). This connecting
pattern was probably caused by the Diels–Alder [4 + 2] cycloaddition
of two guaiane moieties as the dienophile and diene themselves (Scheme 1). This connecting
pattern was also further confirmed by the Cu Kα X-ray crystallographic
analyses (Figure 4)10 and proved to be first identified.

Figure 5 Chemical structure
and selected NMR correlations of 2.

The relative configurations of 2 were identified
from
the NOE correlations from the NMR spectra. The key NOESY correlations
of H3-14/H-2, H3-15′/H-2, and H3-14′/H-2 indicated that they are in the same face and were
assigned as α-oriented, whereas the correlations of H3-15/H-10 place them on the opposite side and assigned as β-oriented
(Figure 5). In order
to further confirm this configuration, the single crystal of 2 was obtained from dichloromethane/methanol (30:1). The single-crystal
X-ray data unambiguously deduced the structure of 2,
and its absolute configuration was also showed in the single-crystal
X-ray data as 2R, 4S, 10R, 4′R, 5′R, and 10′R
(Figure 4).10

Xylopidimer C (3), [α]D20 −43.9
(c 0.121,
MeOH), was obtained as colorless prismatic crystals. The molecular
formula of 3 was found to be C30H38O5 (HRESIMS [M + Na+] at m/z 501.2617; calcd 501.2611), requiring 12 degrees
of unsaturation. The structure of 3 was deduced by NMR
analysis and further confirmed by single-crystal X-ray diffraction,
which indicates that it was a guaiane dimer (Figure 6).11 The IR spectrum
indicated the presence of methyl groups (2964 cm–1), carbonyl groups (1777 cm–1), and hydroxyl groups
(3394 cm–1).

Figure 6 X-ray structure of 3.

Extensive interpretation of the 1H, 13C NMR, 1H–1H
COSY, and HMBC spectra showed that 3 possessed the guaiane
moiety units similar to those of 1 and 2. However, interestingly, another five-membered
ring, which was connected to the heptatomic ring of moiety 3a, was
observed based on the result of single-crystal X-ray diffraction (Figure 6).11 The chemical shift of C-8 (δc 102.8) and
C-11 (δc 85.4) indicated that this five-membered
ring involved a peroxide group between C-8 and C-11. In addition,
hydroxyl was connected to C-8 simultaneously. What is more, the key
HMBC cross-peak from H-15 to C-1′ combined with the 1H–1H COSY correlations of H-3/H-3′, indicated
that the two guaiane moieties of 3 were linked via two
C–C single bonds (C-3 to C-3′ and C-4 to C-1′),
which was different from 1 and 2. This connecting
pattern was probably caused by the Diels–Alder [4 + 2] cycloaddition
of two guaiane moieties as the dienophile and diene themselves (Scheme 1). This connecting
pattern was also further confirmed by the Cu Kα X-ray crystallographic
analyses (Figure 6).11

The relative configurations of 3 were identified from
the NOE correlations from the NMR spectra. The key NOESY correlations
of H3-14/H-3, H-3/H-3′, H2-2′/H-3′,
and H3-14′/H-3′ indicated that they are in
the same face and were assigned as β-oriented, whereas the correlations
of H3-15/H-10 place them on the opposite side and assigned
as α-oriented (Figure 7). However, the relative configuration at C-8 could not be
determined by this NOE analysis. In order to fully confirm the structure
of 3, the single crystal of 3 was obtained
from dichloromethane/methanol (45:1). The single-crystal X-ray data
unambiguously deduced the structure of 3, and its absolute
configuration was also showed in the single-crystal X-ray data as
3R, 4R, 8S, 10R, 1′S, 3′R, and 10′R (Figure 6).11 Although these kinds of structures have been reported previously,
the absolute configuration at C-8 was first determined in this research.

Xylopidimer D (4), [α]D20 −77.4
(c 0.113,
MeOH), was obtained as colorless prismatic crystals. The molecular
formula of 4 was found to be C30H40O4 (HRESIMS [M + Na+] at m/z 487.2811; calcd 487.2819). The structure of 4 was deduced by NMR analysis and further confirmed by single-crystal
X-ray diffraction (Figure 8).12 The results also showed that
it was a guaiane dimer. However, the 13C NMR showed only
15 carbon signals. Thus, 4 consisted of two equivalent
C15H20O2 moieties. The IR spectrum
indicated the presence of methyl groups (2964 cm–1) and carbonyl groups (1694 cm–1).

Figure 8 X-ray structure of 4.

These two moieties were also determined
as a guaiane moiety through
the same method as moiety 1a. The only difference was the reduction
of the two olefinic carbon, C-7 and C-11, because of their chemical
shifts, C-7 (δc57.5) and C-11 (δc 28.5) (Table S4, Supporting Information). Therefore, these two moieties were confirmed as two equivalent
guaiane moieties. The Cu Kα X-ray crystallographic analyses
indicated that these two guaiane moieties were linked via two C–C
single bonds (C-3 to C-3′ and C-4 to C-4′) probably
arisen from [2 + 2] cycloaddition of two guaiane moieties as the dienophile
and diene themselves (Figure 9) (Scheme 1).

Figure 9 Chemical structure and selected NMR correlations of 4.

The relative configuration of 4 was also deduced from
its NOE correlations. The key NOESY correlations of H3-14/H-11
and H3-14/H-3 indicated that they are in the same face
and were assigned as α-oriented, whereas the correlations of
H3-15/H-10 place them on the opposite side and assigned
as β-oriented (Figure 9). As 4 contains two equivalent moieties, the
other part can also be deduced. Moreover, the single crystal of 4 was obtained from dichloromethane/methanol/water (5:2:1).
The single-crystal X-ray data unambiguously deduced the structure
of 4, and its absolute configuration was showed in the
single-crystal X-ray data as 3R, 4R, 7S, 10R, 3′R, 4′R,
7′S, and 10′R (Figure 8).12

Xylopidimer E
(5), [α]D20 18.6 (c 0.107, MeOH),
was obtained as a colorless prismatic crystal. The molecular formula
of 5 was found to be C32H42O7 (HRESIMS [M + Na+] at m/z 561.2829; calcd 561.2823). The structure of 5 was deduced by NMR analysis and further confirmed by single-crystal
X-ray diffraction (Figure 10).13 Compared to its chemical shifts,
its planer construction was the same as one known compound, vielanin
E (Table S5, Supporting Information).6

Figure 10 X-ray structure of 5.

However, as vielanin E not had the data of the single-crystal
X-ray
diffraction, only parts of its absolute construction were confirmed.
In this research, on the basis of the Cu Kα X-ray crystallographic
analyses of 5, it had different absolute construction
compared with some of the known absolute constructing parts of the
vielanin E and its absolute configuration was showed by the single-crystal
X-ray data as 1S, 2S, 3R, 7S, 10R, 1′R, 2′R, 8′S,
and 10′R (Figure 1). Although these kinds of structures have been reported before,
the absolute configuration at C-8 was first determined.

So far,
according to previous studies, most of the sesquiterpene
dimers were biogenetically synthesized through Diels–Alder
cycloaddition reaction of some homo- or heterosesquiterpene moieties.14 In this study, all of the five new guaiane dimers
could be also synthesized through this method and the possible biogenetic
pathway for 1–5 was proposed in Scheme 1, in which the Diels–Alder
cycloaddition reaction is a key step.

Because nitric oxide plays
a significant role in causing inflammation, 1–5 and vielanin A (6), which was also
isolated and identified from X. vielana, this time were therefore tested for their inhibitory activities
against the production of NO in RAW264.7 cells stimulated by lipopolysaccharide
(LPS), as described previously.15 Among
these compounds, 4 exhibited a relatively high inhibitory
effect against the production of NO, with an IC50 value
of 4.59 ± 1.04 μM, and exhibited no cytotoxicity against
RAW264.7 cells after MTT assay. In contrast, other compounds showed
no activity against the production of NO even at the concentration
of 10 μM.

Conclusions
In conclusion, six compounds, 1–5 and vielanin
A, were isolated from the roots of X. vielana. Among these six compounds, five of them (1–5) were new compounds. Interestingly, 1 and 2 exhibited two unique connecting patterns that had not been reported.
Although the moieties of these two compounds were two similar guaianes,
based on the results of single-crystal X-ray analysis, these two connecting
patterns caused huge differences on their carbon skeletons. In addition,
the 4,5-linked exo-Diels–Alder adducts between two guaiane
moieties was first reported by this research. Thus, 1 and 2 should be defined as two novel carbon skeletons
and could lead to some interesting total synthesis. For 3 and 5, the absolute configuration at C-8 was also first
confirmed on these two carbon skeletons. Additionally, these six compounds
were tested for the activity against the production of NO in RAW264.7
stimulated by LPS and 4 exhibited a potent activity against
the production of nitric oxide.

Experimental Section
General
Experimental Procedures
All of the thin-layer
chromatography analysis was conducted with HSGF254 silica
gel plates (Yantai, China). Silica gel (Yantai, China) and silica
gel H (Qingdao, China) were mainly used as packing materials in the
silica gel column. Sephadex LH-20 (Pharmacia Co. Ltd.) was selected
as a major packing material in the sephadex gel column. The purification
step was also assisted by a series of preparative HPLC, The Shimadzu
LC-6AD series together with a SPD-20 spectrophotometer. The Shimadzu
PRC-ODS EV0233 C-18 column was selected as the separation column for
this preparative HPLC. In addition, the Agilent 1200 series HPLC with
DAD detector and a ZOBRAX Extend-C-18 column (250 mm × 4.6 mm,
5 μm) were used as the analytical HPLC. All of the 1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on the Bruker AVANCE-500.
The TMS was utilized as an internal reference, chemical shifts are
shown in δ (ppm), and coupling constants were shown in hertz.
Crystal data were obtained on Bruker D8 VENTURE with a graphite monochromator
with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.54178 Å) at 173 K. The
high-resolution electrospray ionization mass spectra were recorded
on Q-TOF micro YA019 (Waters, USA). A JASCO P-2000 polarimeter was
selected as a major equipment for optical rotation analysis, and all
of the IR spectra were tested on the Bruker FTIR Vector 22 with KBr
pellets.

Plant Materials
The dry roots of X.
vielana were acquired in Fangchenggang, Guangxi province,
China in December 2016. Prof. Huang Baokang (School of Pharmacy, Second
Military Medical University) identified the specimens, and one specimen
(no. 201611MBS) was deposited in the herbarium of Shanghai Key Laboratory
for Molecular Engineering of Chiral Drugs, School of Pharmacy, Shanghai
Jiao Tong University.

Extraction and Isolation
Compounds 1–5 were isolated from the extracts of X. vielana. 1–5 were obtained
by using the following procedure:
dried roots (22.3 kg) were extracted with 95% ethanol three times
at room temperature. The extracts were then filtered and evaporated
under normal pressure to get crude extraction (764.1 g). The crude
extract was suspended in water and then further extracted with petroleum
ether and ethyl acetate (EA) step by step. The EA fraction (70.2 g)
was isolated by a silica gel column chromatography and eluted with
a step gradient of CH2Cl2–MeOH (0:100–0:100,
v/v). After that 11 fractions (EA-1–EA-11) were yielded. EA-2
(2.9 g) was further isolated by MPLC with the mobile phase MeOH–H2O (1:10–100:0, v/v), and three fractions were yielded
(EA-2-1–EA-2-4). 2 (32.2 mg) was purified by preparative
HPLC (MeOH–H2O, 60:40) from EA-2-4. EA-3 (2.3 g)
was purified by the silica gel column chromatography with the gradient
mobile phase of CH2Cl2–MeOH (100:1–0:100,
v/v) and got five fractions (EA-3-1–EA-3-5). 3 (80.8 mg) was finally purified from EA-3-4 via preparative HPLC
(MeOH–H2O, 65:35). EA-4 (5.2 g) was also isolated
through the silica gel column chromatography with the gradient mobile
phase of CH2Cl2–MeOH (100:1–0:100,
v/v), and eight fractions (EA-4-1–EA-4-8) were yielded. EA-4-2
was then isolated and purified by preparative HPLC (MeOH–H2O, 60:40). 4 (7.3 mg), 5 (15.7 mg),
and 6 (17.2 mg) were got from EA-4-2. 1 (70.9
mg) was purified form EA-4-8 by preparative HPLC (MeOH–H2O, 70:30), as well.

Computational Details
The theoretical calculations
on 1–5 were performed using Gaussian 09. The geometries
generated based on NMR were conducted by MestReNova 10.0, and the
X-ray data were optimized using MM2.

Assay for Inhibition Ability
against LPS-Induced NO Production
RAW 264.7 macrophages were
incubated in 24-well plates (105 cells/well)
together with test compounds and LPS (1 μg/mL) for 24 h. The
concentration of the nitrite in the cultured RAW 264.7 macrophage
was tested through the microplate reader. The concentration was therefore
tested because it was equivalent to the nitrate concentration.
