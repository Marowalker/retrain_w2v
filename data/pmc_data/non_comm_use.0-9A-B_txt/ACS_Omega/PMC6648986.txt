Hierarchically
porous silica KIT-6 and SBA-15 mesostructures were
successfully synthesized by using a mesomorphous complex of a nonionic
triblock copolymer (pluronic P123) and an anionic polyelectrolyte
(polyacrylic acid) as the dynamic template. The obtained mesoporous
silica materials possessed both ordered mesopores (∼7 nm) and
nanopores (∼15–50 nm), and the long-range order of the
mesophase was not perturbed by the embedded larger secondary nanopores.
Moreover, hierarchically porous silica KIT-6 exhibited enhanced adsorption
capacity in enzyme and protein immobilization, which was attributed
to the hierarchically porous structure.

==== Body
Introduction
Hierarchically porous
materials can be applied in diverse fields
and have been widely studied.1,2 In general, hierarchically
porous materials possess interconnected porosity at different length
scales, large surface area, excellent permeability and storage properties,
and all these structural characters are important for the loading
and diffusion of substances, endowing them with important applications
in the fields of catalysis, adsorption, separation, and biomedicine.3−9

In recent decades, hierarchically porous materials have been
prepared
by different methods, including soft or hard template method, post-treatment,
acid treatment, freeze-drying, phase separation, and so forth.2,10−16 Hierarchically porous materials could be prepared with soft templates,
but it is always hard to achieve simultaneous regulation of the order
and interconnection of the pore structure because of the difficulty
in controlling the cooperation of different templates.

In nature,
some inorganic materials produced by organisms possess
complex morphologies as well as hierarchically porous structures.17 For instance, sea urchin spines (made of CaCO3 crystals) exhibit a porous morphology and meanwhile remain
single-crystalline. The formation process of the “porous”
single crystals of biominerals is dynamically controlled by a complex
organic matrix generated time-dependently.18 Inspired by the formation mechanism of biominerals, our research
group recently reported a new method to synthesize hierarchically
porous, single-crystalline silica colloids with anionic polyelectrolytes/cationic
surfactants as the dynamic template.19 Because
of the ionic self-assembly between anionic polyelectrolytes and cationic
surfactants, a highly ordered mesomorphous polyelectrolyte-surfactant
complex could form. During the synthesis, negatively charged silica
precursors were directed by the liquid crystal complex template and
an ordered mesostructure was obtained; meanwhile, the electrostatic
interaction between polyelectrolyte chains and surfactant micelles
was disturbed or disassembled. Some of polyelectrolyte chains were
phase-separated from the complex to form chain domains, which acted
as templates for the secondary nanopores within the synthesized materials
after calcination. The polyelectrolyte–surfactant mesomorphous
complex (PSMC) templating method has become a general approach to
prepare hierarchically porous materials, including hierarchically
porous silica,20−25 PMO,20 carbon,26 and titanium phosphate,27 with different
mesomorphous phases and morphologies.

So far, in the PSMC templating
methods reported in the literature,
only cationic surfactants were used to form complexes with anionic
polyelectrolytes via electrostatic interaction. However, the size
of the ordered mesopore was about 3 nm because of the relatively small
size of the cationic surfactant micelles.28 The low-cost and nontoxic nonionic surfactants have exhibited advantages
as templates in the preparation of mesostructured materials. For instance,
the triblock copolymer, P123, is a very popular template for the synthesis
of mesoporous silica SBA-15 and KIT-6, whose mesopore size is generally
larger than 6 nm.29 Herein, we extend the
PSMC templating method to the category of nonionic surfactants. Through
hydrogen-bonding interaction, the anionic polyelectrolyte (PAA) and
nonionic surfactant (P123) can also form a mesomorphous complex,30−32 which can be used as the dynamic template to prepare hierarchically
porous silica KIT-6 (cubic Ia3̅d mesostructure)
and SBA-15 (2D hexagonal P6mm mesostructure).
These materials exhibited well-ordered mesopores (∼7 nm) as
well as larger secondary nanopores (∼15–50 nm). Interestingly
and importantly, the long-range order of KIT-6 and SBA-15 was not
influenced by the presence of secondary nanopores, that is, the hierarchically
porous KIT-6 and SBA-15 exhibited a single crystalline mesostructure,
but with embedded larger nanopores. The hierarchically porous silica
KIT-6 exhibited enhanced adsorptive capacity of biomacromolecules.

Results
and Discussion
In the synthesis procedure, immediately after
the addition of concentrated
HCl to the solution containing P123/PAA, flocculent sediment was observed.
This is because the hydrogen bonding between PAA and PEO segments
of P123 was enhanced by the addition of HCl.30 The precipitated PAA/P123 complex was collected and submitted to
small-angle X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis. As shown in Figure S1, the high-intensity diffraction peak
at 2θ = 0.94° indicated that the complex possessed a well-ordered
mesostructure, though the mesomorphous phase could not be clearly
identified, probably because of the variation of water content in
the complex during the collection and measurement. The transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) images (Figure S2) of the PAA/P123 complex showed that the morphology of the complex
colloids was irregular. Meanwhile, there were ordered mesophases shown
in the images, which corresponds to the mesostructure in the XRD pattern
of the PAA/P123 complex.

After the addition of tetraethyl orthosilicate
(TEOS), the assembly
of silica precursors was directed by the PAA/P123 mesomorphous complex. 13C CP/MAS NMR spectra (Figure S3) of the as-synthesized samples confirmed that both PAA and P123
existed. Small-angle XRD spectra of the calcined samples are shown
in Figure 1a–d,
and all the patterns showed two distinct diffraction peaks in the
range of 2θ = 1.0–1.2°. The expanded XRD patterns
of PAA-0 and PAA-0.2 displayed four resolved diffraction peaks in
the small range of 2θ = 1.4–2.2°. Besides the (211)
and (220) diffraction peaks, there also appeared (321), (400), (420),
and (332) diffractions of the cubic Ia3̅d mesostructure,
indicating that the obtained materials were all KIT-6. For samples
of PAA-0.4 and PAA-0.5, the diffraction peaks at 2θ = 1.4–2.2°
were slightly less resolved, and this is due to the increasing of
the secondary nanopores as discussed in the following.

of the calcined samples (a) PAA-0, (b)
PAA-0.2, (c) PAA-0.4, (d) PAA-0.5, and (e) HCl-5.0.

The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image (Figure S4) of the typical KIT-6 mesoporous silica
(PAA-0.5)
synthesized with the PAA/P123 complex template exhibited the morphology
of irregular micrometer-sized particles, which could inherit from
the morphology of the PAA/P123 complex template (Figure S2). TEM images of the samples PAA-0, PAA-0.5, and
HCl-5.0 are shown in Figure 2. For the sample synthesized without PAA (PAA-0), only highly
ordered single-modal mesopores could be observed (Figure 2a). However, for the samples
synthesized with PAA, besides the highly ordered mesopores, there
appeared heterogeneous contrasts of light and dark inside, indicating
the presence of secondary nanopores within the matrix of the highly
ordered mesoporous structure (Figure 2b–d). The overall long-range order of the mesostructure
remained well even with the embedded secondary nanopores, indicating
a single crystalline mesostructure.

PAA-0, (b,c) PAA-0.5, and

The nitrogen adsorption
desorption isotherms of the samples are
shown in Figure 3.
Without addition of PAA, the sample PAA-0 exhibited a typical type
IV isotherm. The adsorption step at p/p0 of 0.7–0.8 corresponded to a sharp peak at 7.5
nm in the pore size distribution curve (Figures 3 and S5). However,
for the samples of PAA-0.2, PAA-0.4, and PAA-0.5, there appeared two
obvious adsorption steps at p/p0 of about 0.7–0.8
and 0.8–0.95 in adsorption branches, respectively. The first
step was due to nitrogen capillary condensation in the ordered mesopores
of KIT-6 and gave rise to a sharp peak at ∼7.5 nm. With the
increasing amount of PAA in the synthesis, the second adsorption step
became more and more pronounced. For the sample prepared with 0.5
g PAA, the second adsorption step at about p/p0 = 0.8–0.95 corresponded to a broad
peak at ∼15–50 nm, which was due to the secondary nanopores
templated by phase-separated PAA domains, and this was consistent
with the results shown in the TEM images.

isotherms and pore size distribution
curves of the calcined samples PAA-0, PAA-0.2, PAA-0.4, PAA-0.5, and
HCl-5.0.

As shown in Table 1, it could be found that with the increasing
amount of PAA, the d value (d211) increased, while
the order mesopore size decreased, indicating that the mesopore wall
became continuously thicker, which would lead to better hydrothermal
stability.

According
to the literature,33 in the
synthesis of mesoporous silica templated by P123, the mesostructure
could be tuned by the amount of HCl. Here, in our synthesis, while
the amount of concentrated HCl was increased to 5.0 g, the synthesized
sample became 2D hexagonal P6mm mesostructured
SBA-15 (Figure 1e).
Both the TEM image (Figure 2d) and the nitrogen adsorption isotherms (Figure 3, HCl-5.0) showed that SBA-15
templated by PAA/P123 also exhibited a hierarchically porous single-crystalline
mesostructure.

On the basis of the characterizations, the formation
process of
hierarchically porous KIT-6 and SBA-15 particles was sketched. As
shown in Scheme 1,
first, the anionic polyelectrolyte (PAA) and nonionic surfactants
(P123) formed mesomorphous complexes through hydrogen-bonding interaction.
Upon the addition of TEOS, the hydrolyzed silicate ions interacted
with P123 micelles, thus the hydrogen bonding interactions between
P123 and PAA would be dismantled. As a result, some PAA chains were
phase-separated from the PAA/P123 complex, which could act as the
templates for the interstitial nanopores inside the KIT-6 or SBA-15
particles.

As reported in the literature, multimodal porous materials
exhibited
advantages in bioimmobilization.20,34 Here, to test
the bioimmobilization capacity of the obtained hierarchically porous
silica, PAA-0.5 was used as the typical example in the immobilization
of lysozyme and bovine serum albumin (BSA). Figure 4presented
the adsorption curves of PAA-0 and PAA-0.5 in the lysozyme solution.
The adsorption amount of lysozyme on the two samples is listed in Table 2. Obviously, for PAA-0.5,
the adsorption rate was greatly faster than that of PAA-0. The adsorption
capacity of PAA-0 and PAA-0.5 reached 378 and 436 mg g–1, respectively. In the adsorption of BSA, whose molecular size (40 Å × 40
Å × 140 Å) is bigger than that of lysozyme (19 Å
× 25 Å × 43 Å), as listed in Table 2, the immobilized amount of
BSA was approximately 175 mg g–1 onto PAA-0.5, and
this value was larger than that on PAA-0 (115 mg g–1). The higher immobilized amount on PAA-0.5 was attributed to the
hierarchically porous structure.

Conclusions
The PSMC templating method was extended to the category of the
anionic polyelectrolyte–nonionic surfactant mesomorphous complex.
Because of the hydrogen bonding between anionic polyelectrolyte PAA
and nonionic surfactant P123, the self-assembled mesomorphous PAA/P123
complex was first applied to synthesize hierarchically porous KIT-6
and SBA-15, which possessed both ordered mesopores (∼7 nm)
and larger secondary nanopores (∼15–50 nm), and the
long range order of mesopores was not perturbed by the embedded secondary
nanopores, giving rise to a hierarchically porous single crystalline
mesostructure. These kinds of hierarchically porous silica materials,
with ordered mesopores larger than 7 nm and secondary nanopores of
15–50 nm, would be of interest in adsorption of large molecules,
catalyst supports, and hard templates for porous functional materials.35−37 Our experiments have proved that hierarchically porous silica KIT-6
exhibited enhanced loading capacity of biomacromolecules compared
to the single-modal porous KIT-6.

Experimental Section
Chemicals
All chemicals were purchased and used without
further treatment. Pluronic P123 (average molecular weight 5800, EO20PO70EO20) was from Aldrich. Polyacrylic
acid (PAA, average molecular weight 240 000, 25 wt % solution
in water) was the product of Acros Organics. Hydrochloric acid (∼37
wt %) was the product of Tianjin Chemical Reagent Wholesale Company,
China. TEOS and n-butanol were from Aladdin, China.
BSA and lysozyme were products of Sigma-Aldrich.

Preparation
of Hierarchically Porous Silica KIT-6
The
typical synthesis condition of single-modal KIT-6 was based on the
literature.33 The synthesis of hierarchically
porous silica KIT-6 was as follows: At 35 °C, 1.0 g pluronic
P123 was added in 30 mL deionized water to form a solution, and a
certain amount of 25 wt % PAA aqueous solution was added in the static
state (the amount of PAA mentioned later in this paper refers to the
amount of 25 wt % PAA aqueous solution), stirred for 10 min, and then
3.33 g of concentrated HCl (∼37 wt %) was put in. After 10
min of stirring, 1.0 g n-butanol was put in. After
30 min of stirring, 2.0 g of TEOS was added. The solution was kept
in 35 °C water bath under stirring. After 24 h, the solution
was put in an autoclave and was put in an oven at 100 °C for
24 h. The white precipitate was separated by filtration, purged with
water, and dried at 50 °C. The template was removed by calcination
at 550 °C for 6 h.

The samples synthesized with 3.33 g
of concentrated HCl and different amounts of PAA were denoted as PAA-0,
PAA-0.2, PAA-0.4 and PAA-0.5 (the number indicated the grams of the
25 wt % PAA solution used in synthesis), respectively. The sample
synthesized with 0.5 g of PAA and 5.0 g of concentrated HCl was denoted
as HCl-5.0.

Lysozyme Immobilization and BSA Adsorption
The operation
procedures of enzyme and protein adsorption were same as those described
in the previous literature.20

Characterization
The XRD patterns were measured on
a Rigaku D/max-2500 diffractometer, with Cu Kα radiation working
at 40 kV and 100 mA (λ = 0.15418 nm). A JEOL JSM7500F instrument
was used for SEM observations. TEM images were obtained on a Philips
Tecnai F20 microscope, working at 200 kV. The samples were dispersed
in ethanol ultrasonically and copper grids were used to hold the sample.
Nitrogen adsorption and desorption measurements were performed with
a BELSORP-mini II sorption analyzer. The samples were pretreated for
6 h in nitrogen flow at 350 °C. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) method was used to calculate the specific surface area and total
pore volume (obtained at p/p0 equals to 0.98). The data of adsorption branch were used
to calculate the pore size distribution based on the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda
method.
