Carbon dots, a young member of the carbon nanomaterial
family,
are quasi-spherical nanoparticles, which have fluorescent properties
as their key characteristic. A wide range of starting materials and
synthetic routes have been reported in the literature, divided into
two main categories: a top-down and bottom-up approach. Moreover,
a series of different parameters that affect the properties of carbon
dots have been investigated, including temperature, starting pH, as
well as precursor concentration. However, the effect of reaction time
has not been extensively monitored. In our study, a biomass derivative
was treated hydrothermally with varying reaction times to draw a solid
formation mechanism. In addition, we monitored the effect of reaction
time on optical and structural characteristics, as well as the chemical
composition of our materials. Our key findings include a four-stage
formation mechanism, a higher level of crystallinity, and an increasing
brightness over reaction time.

Introduction
Carbon dots (CDs) are a new class of nanomaterials,
which have
attracted tremendous attention due to their unique photoluminescent
(PL) properties, biocompatibility, and low toxicity.1,2 Thus, they appear as rising candidates to replace the metal-based
quantum dots in various applications such as bioimaging3−5 and biosensing,6,7 drug delivery,8 and photocatalysis.9 CDs are
quasi-spherical particles with size of a few nanometer, and among
their key characteristics are hydrophilicity, resistance against photobleaching,
and facile surface modification.10,11 They were
first reported in 2004 when Xu et al. accidentally discovered fluorescent
particles during the purification process of single-walled carbon
nanotubes produced by arc discharge.12 Since
then, a new field triggered with studies focused on their fluorescent
properties.

The synthesis of CDs can be classified according
to their synthetic
methods into two main strategies: top-down and bottom-up. Top-down
strategy refers to the breaking down of large-sized carbonaceous materials
by laser ablation,13 arc discharge,12 acidic oxidation,14 or electrochemical approaches.15 The
bottom-up strategy refers to synthetic approaches from molecular precursors
through thermal or combustion treatments,2,16,17 microwave synthetic routes,18,19 and other solution-based synthetic methods.20,21 Precursors such as saccharides,22 amino
acids,23 and biopolymers17 are among the most common in this strategy. Structural
and optical characteristics of CDs have gained vast attention in the
research community since their first discovery in 2004.12,24,25 Many parameters have been examined
including reaction temperature,26−29 precursor concentration,30 the addition of any doping elements,31−34 and also the ratio between the
starting materials.2,35 However, there are only a few
published reports assessing the effect of the reaction time to monitor
how their properties evolve.30,36,37

In this report, the experimental strategy involved is hydrothermal
carbonization (HTC) to convert the biomass derivatives, such as glucose,
into carbonaceous materials with water as a solvent at mild conditions
(200 °C and 30 bars of self-generated pressure) and varying the
reaction time from 2 to 12 h. This strategy was selected to get the
maximum information possible about how these materials form and what
affects their optical and structural properties, as well as their
chemical composition using a combination of structural and optical
characterization methods. Briefly, we identified a four-stage formation
mechanism, which leads to smaller particle size CDs with a higher
level of crystallinity.

Results and Discussion
In Figure 1, transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) micrographs of CDs with synthesis times
of 2, 4, 6, and 12 h are presented. After 2 h of the synthesis process
(Figure 1a), no nanometer-sized
particles were observed and only flake-like structures can be seen.
Varying sizes of these structures were observed from 400 nm to as
high as a few micrometers. In Figure 1b, images of the sample after a 4 h synthesis are shown.
In this case, there are still ill-shaped particles with sizes of around
200–300 nm, which are significantly smaller compared to the
previous sample but not representative of the carbon dots suggesting
aggregated and unreacted precursor. Figure 1c illustrates the sample produced after 6
h of hydrothermal treatment where a clear transition to nanometer-sized,
quasi-spherical particles occurred, with an average particle size
of 5 nm. More detailed information on the atomic structure of these
particles was thoroughly presented in a previous report.38 In summary, a diverse structure of this sample
was shown to include carbon-onion type, amorphous carbon, and graphitic-like
carbon structures. Finally, in Figure 1d, TEM data for CDs after 12 h of HTC are shown. Size
of the quasi-spherical particles here is further reduced, averaging
at 2.8 nm. Moreover, this sample showed crystalline planes with 2.06
Å separation (Figure S1), identified
as the (111) planes of diamond39,40 and the (100) planes
of graphite.41,42 Additionally, in Figure 1d, one can observe strips extending
from particle to particle, attached to the spherical cores. At this
stage, the origin of these strips remains unclear and requires further
investigation. A preliminary interpretation at this stage is that
these strips are amorphous (compared to the crystalline core of the
CDs) and similar to those observed in the report by Xu et al.,43 who confirmed the presence of amorphous sp3 surface regions in CDs along with the crystalline sp2 carbon core. Our assumption is that the carbon dots are “crystallized”
from the amorphous carbon stripes/cones. We are hoping to confirm
this in upcoming small-angle X-ray scattering experiments performed
“in situ” during the hydrothermal process. Overall,
the particle size reduced over reaction time, while samples appeared
more crystalline. The latter is further supported by a recent study
reported in the literature.44

and size distribution charts (inserts) of CDs synthesized

To obtain further information on how reaction time
affects the
structural characteristics of our samples, we utilized Raman scattering
as it can provide a wealth of information in carbon systems.38,45,46 In particular, the Raman data
of CDs in Figure 2a
indicate that samples have a significant degree of disorder, which
is reflected in an increased D and G peak width.46 D band originates from aromatic conjugated sp2 6-membered carbon rings;47 hence, an
increase in D peak intensity reflects a large number of such ring
clusters. Consequently, broadening of the D band reflects a disorder
in aromatic clusters. The position of the D band strongly depends
on excitation energy,48 and for He–Ne
(632.8 nm) laser used here, the peak is expected at around 1325 cm–1 in graphite. The observed G bands are clearly asymmetric,
which, on the lower wavelength side of the peak in nanoscale systems,
is usually associated with the phonon confinement,49 thus suggesting that the particle size is sufficiently
small for bulk phonon dispersion description to breakdown. As shown
in Table S1, G band full width at half-maximum
is decreasing as a function of synthesis time, which comes to an agreement
with the TEM analysis, thus suggesting a better ordering of carbon
rings. On the contrary, the peak width of the G band and ID/IG decreases during the
same period suggesting a drop in average size, which is again consistent
with the TEM analysis.

Figure 2 (a) Raman spectra (for comparison, Raman spectra of the
precursor
are shown in Figure S2) and (b) summary
of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) data analysis of CDs.

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) findings
show two typical
peaks, C 1s at 284.8 eV and O 1s at 531.8 eV. In the high-resolution
spectra (Figure S3), C 1s band was deconvoluted
into four peaks, which correspond to sp2 carbons (C=C,
284.8 eV), sp3 carbons (C–C, 286.1 eV), carbonyl
carbons (C=O, 287.8 eV), and carboxyl carbons (COOH, 289 eV).44,50,51 The O 1s band contains two peaks
at 531.8 and 533.2 eV for C=O and C–O, respectively.50 The XPS intensity at 286.1 eV gradually increases
from a glucose-2 h sample to glucose-12 h sample, indicating a corresponding
increase in the content of sp3 carbons in the CDs as analysis
from the C 1s spectra shown in Figure 2b. XPS results showed a higher level of homogeneity
in the chemical composition of our CDs and that further correlate
well with the diffraction patterns and Raman data, which showed an
increasing degree of crystallization over reaction time. Overall,
information extracted from the above table suggests the presence of
the graphitic structures, which is confirmed by the sp2/sp3 carbon fraction observed in the C 1s peak for all
samples. C 1s peaks appear narrower over time, further indicating
accumulation in bonding energies suggesting an increasing homogeneity
in CDs composition.

Based on these data, we propose the following
mechanism (illustrated
in Scheme 1) of the
evolution of precursors during synthesis. Initially, dehydration of
the precursor occurs, which leads to aggregation of decomposed products
and mild condensation that forms large-sized polymer nanoparticles
(see Figure 1a). These
polymer nanoparticles shrink due to continuous intramolecular dehydration
as heating proceeds. At this stage, C–C bonds are formed, and
at the same time, aromatic clusters are shaped inside the polymers.
Once the concentration of so-formed clusters reaches the critical
supersaturation point, the nucleation of CDs takes place.52 (Also see Figure 1d.) During this stage, nuclei are formed by the diffusion
of the aromatic clusters toward the particle surface, and simultaneous
passivation with various functional groups (hydroxyl, carbonyl, carboxyl,
etc.) takes place. Over time, polymer nanoparticles tend to extinct
(convert) giving place to CDs; therefore, the ratio polymers:dots
decrease leading to a smaller particle size of CDs and less polycrystallinity
(Figure 1d). In the
last stage, the smaller particle size and narrower distribution are
narrower as a result of polymer decomposition.

Mechanism of CDs Hydrothermally Synthesized from
Glucose
Further, origins of light absorption and emission
will be investigated.
The variation in surface functionality could be identified with a
change in UV–vis absorption spectra.53 In this manner, UV–vis spectra of as-synthesized CDs are
shown in Figure 3,
where a clear effect of reaction time is observed. The 4 h synthesis
sample showed two peaks, one at 244 nm (5.08 eV), corresponding to
the π → π* transition of the aromatic sp2 domains,54 and another strong absorption
band at 303 nm (4.09 eV), usually present in molecular-like energy
states and attributed to the n → π* transition of C=O
bond.26,37,55 The later
adsorption band was maintained in the sample produced after 6 h, while
the 244 nm was replaced by an absorption shoulder. Finally, at 12
h, the previously sharp peak is weakened, whereas a new one was formed
at ∼320 nm (3.87 eV), which is assigned to n → π*
transitions by nonbonding orbitals such as C=O bonds.56,57 While absorption measurements provide information about transitions
between the ground and the excited states, photoluminescence excitation
(PLE) provides information about the energy levels contributing to
the specific light emission bands. The normalized absorption, PLE,
and PL spectra of CDs are presented in Figure 3. CD spectra shown in Figure 3 exhibit two PLE bands at 240 nm (5.17 eV)
and 340 nm (3.65 eV), which are attributed to the presence of different
types of emission sites on their surface.58

Figure 3 Normalized
absorption, PLE, and PL emission plots of (a) 4 h, (b)
6 h, and (c) 12 h CDs.

PL emission in each case is located in the blue
region of the electromagnetic
spectrum (at ∼440 nm). From the obtained PLE data, one can
see that there is one dominant excitation peak at 340 nm, which indicates
that the blue emission of CDs originates from energy levels located
in the range of electronic transition on C=O bonds.59 Most likely, they correspond to highest occupied
molecular orbital–lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (HOMO–LUMO)
energy levels (e.g., and π–π* transitions) in sp2 bound carbon clusters.

Emission spectra were recorded
using excitation wavelengths ranging
from 220 to 480 nm with a step of 20 nm. The detailed excitation-dependent
PL experiments reveal a complex picture of light emission with strong
emission in the blue-green region of the visible light spectrum, as
presented in Figure 4. CDs synthesized after 2 h did not show any PL; therefore, they
were excluded from this analysis. Despite the complex structure of
PL spectra suggesting multiple sources of emission, one can broadly
identify two distinct regions common for all samples, clearly pointing
to a discrete transition between different emission channels as the
excitation wavelength is changed. One is upon excitation between 200
and 340 nm, where PL peak positions are nearly independent of the
excitation and another is upon excitation between 360 and 480 nm,
where PL peak positions are excitation-dependent. A number of published
reports show CDs with similar PL behavior with two emission channels.26,60−63

spectra of (a) 4 h, (b) 6 h, and (c) 12 h CDs.

Nevertheless, light emission occurred from samples
synthesized
after 4 h is unusual, given that they showed large polymeric aggregates
in TEM (Figure 1b).
Fluorescence, in this case, could possibly be ascribed to a combination
of molecular fluorophores, which form during the early stages of the
synthesis. Such molecules are either bound to the particle surface
or embedded in the amorphous matrix. As reaction time increases, they
give way to the growth of aromatic domains comprising carbon and/or
nitrogen atoms. This agrees well with the chemical composition analysis
and particularly the XPS results (Figure 2b), where the contribution of sp3-hybridized carbons increases with reaction time.

Photoluminescent
quantum yield (PLQY) is an accurate index revealing
information on the efficiency of fluorescent materials. The most consistent
method for calculating PLQY is the comparative method of Williams
et al.64 The PLQY of CDs is illustrated
in Figure 5, where
values increase linearly over reaction time.

The radiative lifetime of emission is an important
characteristic
of light-emitting nanoparticles, as different radiative lifetimes
may correspond to different light emission mechanisms. To further
explore the origin of light emission of our CD samples, time-resolved
PL decay spectra were collected. Employing excitation wavelengths
from both excitation-independent and excitation-dependent emission
regions and an emission range between 440 and 640 nm, time-resolved
PL decay spectra were recorded. Example decay traces of CDs along
with their fitting curves are presented in Figure S4. We found that the best fit to the data required using biexponential
functions. The biexponential behavior of CDs indicates that two different
emissive sites are present and the fluorescence state is presumably
due to the carbon core and surface traps.65,66 Full studies were further performed, and the average PL lifetimes
extracted from the time-resolved PL decays were compared and are presented
in Figure 6. The calculated
lifetime values showed different evolutions at short and long excitation
wavelengths. At short excitation wavelengths, CDs showed gradually
shorter lifetimes upon reaction time increase, obtaining maximum values
of 7, 6.5, and 6 ns after 4, 6, and 12 h syntheses, respectively.
When excited at longer wavelengths, glucose-4 h and glucose-6 h samples
showed similar profile with lifetimes shorter compared to the previous
excitation region, which were gradually decreasing over emission wavelength
from ∼6 ns down to 4 ns. On the contrary, lifetimes of glucose-12
h sample appeared significantly longer, but again had a decreasing
trend, implying that a different PL mechanism controls its fluorescence.

Figure 6 Average
PL lifetimes under various excitation wavelengths over
the whole emission range of (a) 4 h, (b) 6 h, and (c) 12 h CDs.

The evolution of the time-resolved PL indicates
that two different
pathways of light emission are responsible for the fast (long-wavelength
emissions) and the slow (short-wavelength emissions) decays, respectively.
Contrary to previous studies,67 the obtained
lifetimes (apart from glucose-12 h sample) do not obey the established
mechanism, where the average lifetime progressively lengthens with
increasing emission wavelengths.

Overall, when structural and
optical data were considered collectively,
they indicate HOMO–LUMO transitions within the carbon core
as the origin of the excitation-independent PL light emission present
at short-wavelength excitations, while excitation-dependent PL emission
present at longer wavelength excitations is most likely due to the
surface defect states, as illustrated in Scheme S1. Taking into account the surface-related analysis, the origin
of light emission is attributed to the interaction between the carbon
core and the surface functional groups (hydroxyl, carboxyl, carbonyl,
amines, and amides) upon light absorption.

Conclusions
In this study, CDs were synthesized hydrothermally
from glucose
with varying reaction time from 2 to 12 h. TEM showed a decrease in
particle size, while a higher level of monodispersity over reaction
time was attained. Based on the above, the formation mechanism of
CD particles was proposed, suggesting four stages including precursor
decomposition, followed by polymerization/aromatization, nucleation,
and growth. High-resolution TEM (HRTEM) and diffraction patterns showed
that less crystalline phases were present at longer reaction times.
Finally, HRTEM findings suggested that CDs are possibly composed of
a graphitic sp2 carbon core functionalized with peripheral
carboxylic/carbonyl groups and sp3 carbon defects. Further,
results from Raman spectroscopy indicated that although samples possessed
a significant degree of disorder, they showed a higher level of crystallinity
as reaction time increased. That imprints on the decreasing ID/IG ratio and peak
width of the G band, which was in good agreement with the TEM findings.
As per optical properties, PL emission spectra revealed two distinct
regions common for all samples pointing to a discrete transition between
different emission channels as the excitation wavelength is changed.
Finally, time-resolved PL measurements proposed that CDs show two
different pathways of light emission: the fast (long-wavelength emissions)
and the slow (short-wavelength emissions) decays.

Materials and Methods
d-(+)-Glucose (≥99.5%),
quinine sulfate dihydrate,
and sulfuric acid (reagent grade, 95–98%) were purchased from
Sigma-Aldrich. Glucose was used as a precursor for the hydrothermal
synthesis of CDs. Aqueous solution (4% w/v) of the precursor was prepared
and placed in a Teflon-lined, stainless steel autoclave, which underwent
hydrothermal treatment at 200 °C with variable reaction time
(2, 4, 6, and 12 h). The obtained orange to dark brown liquid phase
was centrifuged at 20 000 rpm for 10 min to separate the liquid
containing fluorescent CDs from the solid black precipitate. The liquid
phase containing CDs were then filtered using standard syringe filters
and further membrane dialyzed against water and freeze-dried for further
characterization. TEM was performed on a JEOL JEM-2010 electron microscope.
Raman spectra were obtained through a Renishaw 1000 microspectrometer.
XPS measurements were carried out on a K-Alpha spectrometer utilizing
a monochromatic Al Kα X-ray source. UV–vis absorption
spectra were recorded with a Perkin Elmer Lambda LS35 UV–vis
spectrometer. PL spectra were recorded with a Perkin Elmer LS55 fluorescence
spectrometer. For the time-resolved PL measurements, laser light was
generated by a Continuum Surelite (SLI-10) laser and the beam then
passes through an optical parametric oscillator. Then, photoluminescence
was collected and collimated onto a Jobin Yvon Horiba Triax 550 spectrometer.
A liquid nitrogen cooled photomultiplier tube (PMT) was used to detect
and multiply the signal collected from the spectrometer. The response
from the PMT was then sent to an oscilloscope and finally the PL spectra
and a computer recorded lifetime data. PLQY (Φ) was calculated
by comparing CDs to the reference quinine sulfate (Φ = 0.54).
By plotting the integrated fluorescence intensity vs absorbance values
for both CDs and quinine sulfate, the slope of the curves was determined
and the PLQY of CDs was calculated.64,68
