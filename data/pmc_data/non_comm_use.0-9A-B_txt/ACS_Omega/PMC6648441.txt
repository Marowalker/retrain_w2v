This work describes
solid-state asymmetric supercapacitors (ASCs),
composed of aniline oligomers as a cathode, nonoxidative graphene
sheet as an anode, and polyvinyl alcohol–potassium hydroxide
gel as an electrolyte. The synergistic effects resulting from the
combination of aniline oligomer and graphene sheet have greatly enhanced
the electrical and electrochemical performance of ASCs. The electrical
and electrochemical properties of ASCs were highly dependent on the
protonation levels of aniline oligomers including aniline tetramer,
aniline trimer, and aniline dimer. The aniline tetramer with an appropriate
chain length provided higher carrier transport within the anode compared
to that of the aniline dimer and trimer. The water-dispersible graphene
(WDG) sheets greatly enhanced structural stability and cycle life
of aniline tetramers by alleviating swelling, chain scission, and
shrinking of the aniline tetramers. The ASC composed of aniline tetramer/WDG
sheet exhibited high areal capacitance (62.2 mF/cm2), volumetric
capacitance (207.4 F/cm3), and good cycling stability (97.2%
after 2000 cycles and 90.4% after 10 000 cycles). The strategy
presented in this work is simple and facile, which would give an insight
into efficient ways for applying aniline tetramers and graphene sheet
for state-of-art electronic applications.

Introduction
With rapidly growing
energy needs, clean energy sources including
solar, wind, and tidal power have attracted a great deal of interest
as next-generation and renewable energy technologies, and diversified
technologies for improving the energy efficiency have been greatly
developed. However, the technology to efficiently store and reuse
clean energy remains a challenge.1,2 Therefore,
it is an urgent requirement to develop and optimize a high-performance
energy storage device capable of storing large amounts of electric
charges. Among various energy storage devices, supercapacitors are
one of the most promising energy storage devices because of their
rapid charging process, high power density, excellent low-temperature
performance, and long life cycles.3−9 Such fascinating virtues of supercapacitors have stimulated the
future growth of the high-performance supercapacitors with improved
energy density, power density, cycle life, and cost-effectiveness.
Supercapacitors can be classified as electrical double layer capacitors
(EDLCs) and pseudocapacitors depending on the charge storage mechanism.3−9 In the EDLCs, electric charges are stored through quick adsorption/desorption
of electrolyte ions on the surface of carbon materials.6−8 Pseudocapacitors store electric charges through the reversible oxidation/reduction
processes of the metal oxides and conducting polymers (CPs). The EDLCs
provide high operation voltage, high power density, and excellent
cycle life, while the EDLCs suffer from low energy density because
of the limited redox reactions of carbons.9 Pseudocapacitors provide higher capacitance compared with the carbons,
whereas the cycle life and structural stability of pseudocapacitors
are inferior to those of the EDLCs.5−9 During the reversible insertion/desertion of electrolyte ions within
the metal oxides and CPs, these materials are usually damaged or abolished.
Moreover, the operation voltage of pseudocapacitors is limited to
less than 1.23 V; the power density of the pseudocapacitors becomes
lower than that of the EDLCs.3 Asymmetric
supercapacitors (ASCs) can take advantage of the synergistic effects
from the EDLCs and pseudocapacitors, thereby offering higher output
compared to the symmetric supercapacitors. However, the cycle life
and potential window of ASC are still inferior to those of the symmetric
supercapacitors based on EDLC. For these reasons, it is necessary
to create and design ASCs with excellent cycle stability and high
operating voltage.5−9

Among the numerous CPs, PANI is one of the most promising
candidates
for pseudocapacitors because of its fascinating virtues, such as facile
synthesis, excellent redox sensitivity, and good electrical conductivity
up to 103 S/cm.10,11 Although poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)
(PEDOT) has higher conductivity compared to PANI, PANI offers faster
oxidation/reduction reactions and better electrochemical activity.
Thus, it is certain that PANI and aniline derivatives are more suitable
for energy storage devices than the PEDOT.9,30,31 Because of such excellent electrochemical
and electrical properties, PANI can store large amounts of electric
charges. Therefore, various studies on the synthesis of PANI materials
for supercapacitors have been carried out through chemical oxidative
polymerization and electrochemical polymerization.10−14 However, PANI usually suffers from volumetric degradation
and scission upon exposure to electrolyte ions, resulting in limited
cycle life of the supercapacitors. Furthermore, the actual capacitance
of PANI is lower than the theoretical capacitance because only PANI
near the electrolyte ions is involved in the charging process.9−11,14 In particular, aniline tetramers
provide electrical and electrochemical properties comparable to the
PANI, while the aniline tetramer is less susceptible to volumetric
degradation, chain scission, and shrinking caused by long chain swelling
during the charging and discharging processes.15,16 Thus, extensive studies have been conducted to synthesize aniline
oligomers including dimers, trimers, tetramers, and pentamers to overcome
the limited cycle life of PANI.15−19

Graphene, a single layer carbon material composed of sp2-hybridized carbons, provides high surface area, good electron
mobility,
mechanical strength, and chemical stability.5−8,20 Because
of its outstanding properties, graphene is considered as the most
attractive candidate to enhance the cycle life and electrical conductivity
of PANI and aniline tetramer. In recent years, great efforts have
been taken to fabricate supercapacitors based on graphene materials
and aniline derivatives including PANI and aniline tetramers.11,13,14,16 The capacitance of graphene/PANI composite paper was 763 F/g at
1 A/g, and the capacitance of composite paper could remain 82% after
1000 cycles.21 Lee et al. reported that
the aniline tetramer/graphene oxide composite with a specific capacitance
of 769 F/g at 1 A/g and capacitance degradation of 2.3% after 2000
cycles.16 Despite such progress, the cycling
stability of aniline/graphene composite-based supercapacitors still
requires further improvement compared to the carbon-based EDLCs.11,13,15,16,21 Furthermore, most aniline/graphene composite-based
supercapacitors were demonstrated with three electrode supercapacitors,
which cannot be practical in real life.1,3−11,16,21 Accordingly, appropriate selection of the cell type has become an
important issue to ensure the practical application of aniline/graphene
composite-based supercapacitors. In addition, the operating voltage
of supercapacitors can be enhanced by selecting the asymmetric cells
instead of using the symmetric cell.5−8,22−27 In the ASCs, the graphene sheet as the anode stores electric charges
through the EDLC mechanism, while the cathode, which consists of PANI
or aniline tetramers, stores electric charges through the oxidation/reduction
reaction. Thus, it is necessary to find out effective strategies for
constructing the hybrid ASC with high specific capacitance and good
reliability.

Herein, this work describes the fabrication of
hybrid ASCs based
on aniline oligomers as a cathode, water-dispersible graphene (WDG)
sheet as an anode, and polyvinyl alcohol–potassium hydroxide
(PVA–KOH) gel as an electrolyte. Aniline oligomers including
tetramer, trimer, and dimer acted as pseudocapacitors to store electric
charges by reversible oxidation/reduction reactions with the PVA–KOH
gel electrolyte. The different performances of ASC were mainly due
to the level of protonation and the chain length of the aniline oligomer.
Therefore, this work mainly focuses on identifying the optimal aniline
oligomer to enhance the electrical and electrochemical performances
of ASCs. WDG sheets, which were exfoliated by the electrochemical
method, were highly dispersible with water without any polymeric binder,
resulting in better conductivity compared with the conventional reduced
graphene oxides (RGOs).28,29 These WDG sheets not
only act as the EDLCs but also improve the cycle life of ASCs by alleviating
the volumetric degradation, scission, and shrinking of aniline oligomers.
Because of the synergistic effects arising from the combination of
aniline oligomers and graphene sheets, the electrical and electrochemical
performances of ASCs were significantly enhanced. The ASC employing
aniline tetramers exhibited higher areal capacitance (CA = 62.2 mF/cm2 at 83 mA/cm3), volumetric
capacitance (CV = 207.4 F/cm3 at 83 mA/cm3), and cycle life (90.4% after 10 000
cycles) compared to both aniline trimers and aniline dimers.

Results
and Discussion
Figure 1 illustrates
the structure of an ASC, which is composed of current collectors,
electrode materials, and electrolytes. As a current collector, a stainless
steel foil was chosen in the ASC. Aniline oligomers, such as tetramer,
trimer, and dimer, were prepared by chemical oxidation reaction, and
these oligomers were used as cathode materials in the ASC. Protonation
of aniline oligomers using hydrochloric acid generates positive charges
in the repeating units of the aniline oligomer chain so that the protonated
aniline oligomers tend to accept electrons from graphene sheets with
high electron density. Therefore, the protonation level of aniline
oligomers were a very crucial factor affecting the electron transfers
to an anode composed of graphene sheets.32−34 To ensure good
dispersion of the aniline oligomers, the synthesized oligomers were
fabricated into the pastes with the aids of Teflon and activated carbons
(ACs). The pastes of aniline oligomers were coated onto the stainless
steel substrates using the spin coating method; the resulting films
were used as cathode materials in the ASC. The aniline oligomers store
electric charges through the redox reactions with electrolyte ions.
The performances of ASCs are mainly dependent on the type of aniline
oligomers. Thus, the following paragraphs primarily focus on the processes
of finding an aniline oligomer that can achieve the optimized performance
of ASC. WDG pastes were prepared by the nonoxidative and electrochemical
exfoliation process, which enables the stable dispersions of graphene
sheets without any polymeric binders.28,29 The WDG sheet
plays an important role as the EDLC to store energy through ion adsorption/desorption.
The capacitance losses from swelling and breakage of the aniline oligomers
are significantly minimized by the WDG sheets. Moreover, the large
surface area of WDG allows more electrolyte ions to be adsorbed and
desorbed on the electrode surface. The WDG sheets were deposited onto
the stainless steel foil, and as-prepared WDG electrode acted as an
anode to transfer electrons to a cathode consisting of the protonated
aniline oligomers. During the charging process, electrons returned
from a cathode to an anode. The PVA membrane improves the reliability
of the ASC by preventing evaporation of the KOH electrolyte. Considering
these facts, the synergistic effects from the aniline oligomer, WDG
sheet, and PVA–KOH electrolyte lead to enhanced electrochemical
performances of the ASC.

oligomers, graphenes,
and PVA–KOH electrolytes.

Figure 2 represents
the field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) images of
the electrodes of aniline oligomers. The average particle size of
the dimer, trimer, and tetramer was 140–360, 270–628
nm, and 700–890 nm, respectively (Figure 2a–c). The results imply that size
of the oligomer samples increased with increasing molecular weight
of the aniline oligomers. In addition, the size distribution of the
aniline tetramer was narrower than the size distribution of the dimer
and trimer samples. It is assumed that the larger size of tetramers
improves the interparticle connectivity, resulting in better electron
transfers within the cathodes.28−31Figure S1 shows the FE-SEM
image of WDG sheets used as anode materials in the ASC. The sizes
of WDG sheets ranged from 2 to 5 μm, and these WDG sheets were
well-dispersed on the current collector. The successful formation
of WDG sheets was proven by Raman spectroscopy (Figure S2). Several distinctive peaks for WDG were observed
at 1349, 1575, and 2661 cm–1, corresponding to D
band, G band, and 2D band, respectively.28−31 The D band originates from the
breathing mode of the sp2 carbon atoms, which is caused
by structural defects. The G band is attributable to the first-order
scattering of E2g vibrational mode of sp2 carbon
atoms. Moreover, a broad 2D band at around 2661 cm–1 indicates that the WDG is composed of few-layered graphene sheets.
As the disordered structure in the graphene sheet increases during
the extensive oxidation of graphite and the reduction process of GO,
the size of the sp2 domain in the carbon materials decreases.
Thus, the intensity ratio of the D to the G band (ID/IG) of RGO (1.23) was higher
than that of WDG (0.39). The oxidation of graphite causes the formation
of sp3 carbon atoms, resulting in the red shift of the
G peak in the spectrum of RGO. Furthermore, the reducing agent changes
in the electronic structure of GO, leading to an increased wavenumber
of the G peak of RGO. For these reasons, the D band (1355 cm–1) and G band (1580 cm–1) of the RGO are shifted
toward higher wavenumbers than that of the WDG sheet. Considering
the Raman spectra of WDG and RGO, it was clear that the WDG sheet
was different from the conventional RGO sheet.

trimer, and (c) aniline tetramer.

In order to confirm the chemical structures of the aniline
oligomers,
the hydrogen-1 nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) solution
spectra of the samples in the fully reduced state are shown in Figure 3. In every spectrum
of the samples, the peak for DMSO-d6 was
found at 4.6–4.8 ppm. The signals of the NH2 group
of dimer, trimer, and tetramer appeared at 4.77, 4.66, and 4.63 ppm,
respectively.18,19 In the spectrum of the dimer,
the peaks at 6.52–6.55, 6.59, 6.75–6.84, 7.08, and 7.46
were attributed to the H1, H5, H2 + H3, H4, and Hb protons, respectively
(Figure 3a).18,19 In the spectrum of the trimer, the peaks at 6.48–6.51, 6.62,
6.75–6.79, 6.81–6.84, 6.88–6.91, 7.10, and 7.25
were attributed to the H1, H7, H2 + H3, H4, H5, H6, and
Hb protons, respectively (Figure 3b).18,19 In the spectrum of
the tetramer, the peaks at 6.47–6.50, 6.64, 6.74–6.77,
6.85–6.87, 6.92–6.95, 7.08–7.11, 7.14–7.16,
7.44, and 7.69 were attributed to the H1, H9, H2 + H3, H4+5+6, H7, H8, Hb, Hc, and Hd protons,
respectively (Figure 3c).18,19 Given these facts, the observed NMR spectra
are in good agreement with the predicted formula of the synthesized
dimer, trimer, and tetramer.

(c) aniline
tetramer in the leucoemeraldine oxidation state.

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was utilized to investigate
changes in the elemental compositions and doping states of the aniline
oligomers (Figure 4). Figure 4a represents
the fully scanned XPS patterns of the dimer, trimer, and tetramer
after HCl doping. Every spectrum showed distinctive peaks at 284,
400, and 198 corresponding to C(1s), N(1s), and Cl(2p), respectively.11,30,31 The peaks for C(1s), N(1s), and
Cl(2p) are attributed to the PANI doped by aqueous HCl solutions.
The results indicate that the NO2 group of the aniline
oligomers was successfully converted into the amine group. Table 1 represents the elemental
composition of HCl-doped aniline oligomers obtained from the XPS analyses.
The Cl/N ratios of aniline oligomers were almost close to 0.5, suggesting
that the oligomers are appropriately doped.11,30Figure 4b–d
shows the N(1s) core spectra of the dimer, trimer, and tetramer doped
by aqueous HCl solutions. The spectra of aniline oligomers represented
three peaks at 399.0–399.6, 400.1–400.6, and 401.3–402.0
eV, corresponding to −NH– (neutral amine nitrogen),
−NH•+ (polaron), and =NH+ (bipolaron), respectively.11,30 The ratio of N+ species (sum of −NH•+ and =NH+) to N species (sum of −NH–, −NH•+ and =NH+) (N+/N ratio)
was calculated to evaluate the doping levels of aniline oligomers.
The N+/N ratio was 0.32, 0.66, and 0.77 for the dimer,
trimer, and tetramer, respectively (Table 2). The proportion of positively charged nitrogen
of the −NH•+ and =NH+ groups
increased with the molecular weight and particle size of the oligomers.
The results indicate that the tetramer has less structural defects
and more charge carriers than the dimer and trimer.11,30 In addition, it is assumed that the tetramer with a larger particle
size allows the conductive areas in the tetramer to become more connected. Table 3 summarizes the electrical
conductivities of WDG and aniline oligomers. Conductivity of the WDG
was about 44 S cm–1, indicating that the WDG offers
sufficient currents at the anode. Conductivity of aniline oligomers
(given in S cm–1) increased in the following order:
dimer (7.2 × 10–3) < trimer (3.4 ×
10–2) < tetramer (2.5 × 10–1). Although the conductivity of aniline tetramer was lower than that
of the WDG, it was clear that the tetramer exhibited better current
collection than the trimer and dimer. These conducting values were
consistent with the XPS results shown in Figure 4b–d, indicating that the electrical
conductivity of aniline oligomers was directly affected by the level
of protonation. Given these facts, the higher doping level of the
aniline tetramer enables extended conduction paths for delocalizing
more electrons, thereby improving the conductivity of the cathode
in the ASC.10,11,30,31

To
identify the effects of aniline oligomers on the electrochemical
performances of the ASCs, the electrochemical evaluations of ASCs
assembled with dimer, trimer, and tetramer are shown in Figures 5–7. The CV curves of the ASCs were measured
in a PVA–KOH electrolyte at scan rates from 10 to 90 mV/s (Figure 5a–c). Because
of the high voltage window of WDG, a wide voltage range of ASCs of
0–2.0 V could be applied. Among the ASCs, the tetramer sample
has shown the largest CV area than that of the trimer and dimer at
every scan rate. It is considered that both the charge storage by
the redox reaction of the tetrameric molecules and the charge storage
by the charge adsorption/desorption at the surface of the WDG sheets
functioned properly in the ASC containing the aniline tetramer.13−16 In the case of ASCs containing dimers or trimers, it can be seen
that there is not enough redox reaction to store the electric charge.
Therefore, the ASC containing the dimers or trimers mainly depend
on the charge storage due to the electric double layer reaction at
the WDG electrode so that the area of the CV curves become smaller. Figure 5d shows the Nyquist
plots of ASCs assembled with tetramer, trimer, and dimer. Vertical
straight lines in the low-frequency region were observed in the Nyquist
plots for every sample. This suggests that the effective ion diffusion
and proper capacitive behavior can be achieved using the aniline oligomer/graphene
cell configuration.1,3−9,22−27 The equivalent series resistance of the ASCs increased as following
orders: tetramer (0.74 Ω/cm2) < trimer (2.73 Ω/cm2) < dimer (7.43 Ω/cm2). This indicates
that the aniline tetramers with four electron arms have higher electron
density around the molecules, resulting in higher conductivity for
the electrolyte and reduced internal resistance (IR) compared to the
trimers and dimers.

To evaluate the capacitive
performances of ASCs assembled with
dimer, trimer, and tetramer, galvanostatic charge–discharge
(GCD) curves were acquired at currents of 83, 249, 415, and.830 mA/cm3 with a voltage from 0 to 2.0 V (Figure 6a–c). The symmetrical shape of the
charge and discharge curves for each sample indicates that the charge
and discharge currents are stabilized.3,26 ASCs with
tetramers showed longer discharge time at every current. The results
indicate that the tetramers have better capacitive behavior compared
to the trimers and dimers. As the current increases, the proportion
of side reactions increases as a direct result of the Butler–Volmer
equation.3 Thus, the increased side reactions
decrease the discharging time of the ASCs. In particular, the ASC
assembled with the tetramer shows gradual decreases in the discharge
time with increasing current, demonstrating that the tetramer chain
has a higher structural stability than the dimer and trimer. In addition,
the IR drops observed from the discharging curves are also shown in Figure 6d. At each current
density, the IR drop of ASCs employing tetramers was significantly
smaller than that of the trimer and dimer. Furthermore, the IR increase
of the cell containing the tetramer was gradually compared to the
dimer and trimer. The IR values indicate that the tetramer with the
higher protonation level provides higher conductivity compared to
that of the trimer and dimer.10,11,15−19 Because of the high electrical conductivity and structural stability
of the tetramer, the applicability of an ASC based on the tetramers
is considered to be higher than the ASCs with dimers and trimers.

To evaluate the practical applicability of supercapacitors for
state-of-art electronic applications, areal capacitance (CA) and volumetric capacitance (CV) of the ASCs at different currents are shown in Figure 7a. As the current
increases, both the CA and CV of the samples decreased. This indicates that as the
current increases, it is more difficult for the electrolyte ions to
diffuse into the electrode materials. The CA (mF/cm2) obtained at a current of 83 mA/cm3 increased in the following order: dimer (26.2) < trimer (28.9)
< tetramer (62.2). The same tendency was also observed for the
volumetric capacitance (CV, F/cm3) values at a current of 83 mA/cm3 in the following order:
dimer (87.2) < trimer (96.2) < tetramer (207.4). These results
reconfirm that the improved capacitive behaviors of the ASC with the
tetramer are in good agreement with the results of the XPS, CV, and
Nyquist plots. In particular, the ASC assembled with tetramers has
shown slower decreases in capacitance for currents than the samples
containing dimers and trimers. This indicates that the tetramer structure
is suitable for promoting the adsorption and desorption of electrolyte
ions even at higher currents.3,16 In contrast to the
tetramer, the ASCs with trimers and dimers have shown that the capacitances
decrease more rapidly with increasing currents, implying that both
the dimer and trimer undergo generally low protonation levels and
poor electrolyte adsorption/desorption. Considering these facts, it
was clear that the rate capability of the ASC was significantly improved
by choosing aniline tetramers and WDG as the cathode and anode materials,
respectively. In order to further compare the performance of ASCs
employing tetramers, trimers, and dimers, the Ragone plots of the
ASCs for volumetric energy density versus volumetric power density
are represented in Figure 7b. It was found that the ASC assembled with tetramers could
store more energy per volume than the trimer and dimer samples. The
maximum energy density of tetramer sample was 0.115 W h/cm3 with a power density of 0.208 W/cm3 and gradually decreased
to 0.088 W h/cm3 with a power density of 2.08 W/cm3. The higher energy density per unit volume implies that the
ASC composed of tetramers and WDG electrodes is well suited to achieve
miniaturization of advanced electronic devices. The gradual reductions
in energy density indicate that the structural stability of the tetramer
is superior to both trimers and dimers, which is advantageous to maximize
the synergistic effects from both pseudocapacitors and EDLC mechanisms.1,3−9 By comparison, tetramers store more energy compared to dimers and
trimers, indicating that the appropriate chain length of the aniline
oligomer provides improved structural stability for interacting with
electrolyte ions. To ensure the reliability of the ASCs consisting
of aniline oligomers and WDG electrodes, the cycling stabilities of
the ASCs containing the tetramer, trimer, and dimer were measured
with GCD cycles at a current density of 83 mA/cm3 (Figure 7c). After 10 000
cycles, the retention rates of the samples (given in %) increased
in the following order: dimer (70.8) < trimer (78.0) < tetramer
(90.4). The capacitance losses of the samples are mainly ascribed
to following reasons.10,11,14−16 (1) During the adsorption/desorption of electrolyte
ions, the volumetric changes and swelling of the aniline oligomers
become significant. (2) Evaporation of the electrolyte ions causes
the deterioration of the ASC performances. Despite the inevitable
losses in the capacitances of the samples, it was found that the tetramer
structure provides better structural stability, which prevents the
aniline tetramer from swelling and breaking during repeated cycling.
In addition, the PVA gel effectively prevented the evaporation of
electrolyte ions during a number of charge/discharge cycles.23 It was also conceivable that the WDG electrode
with high mechanical strength and chemical stability contributed to
the improved cycling stability of the ASC. Judging from these results,
the configuration of ASCs was effective to magnify the synergistic
effects from the aniline oligomer and WDG. Table 4 summarizes the overall performances of state-of-art
ASCs and our work.22−27 In comparison to the previous ASCs based on carbon nanomaterials,
graphene sheets, transition metals, and polymers, our work has demonstrated
higher or comparable capacitive characteristics. This suggests that
solid-state ASCs can be successfully constructed by selecting aniline
tetramers, WDG, and PVA–KOH as the cathode, anode, and electrolyte,
respectively.

Conclusions
In this work, the hybrid
ASCs based on aniline oligomers as a cathode,
WDG sheet as an anode, and PVA–KOH gel as an electrolyte were
successfully manufactured. The level of protonation of the aniline
tetramer was superior to that of the trimer and dimer, thus affecting
the resulting performances of the ASCs. The ASC fabricated from the
aniline tetramer/WDG configuration exhibited higher areal capacitance
(62.2 mF/cm2 at 83 mA/cm3), volumetric capacitance
(207.4 F/cm3 at 83 mA/cm3), and energy density
(0.115 W h/cm3) than the samples fabricated from the dimer
and trimer electrodes. In addition, the capacitive retention rate
of the aniline tetramer/graphene hybrid configuration reached up to
90.4% after 10 000 cycles, suggesting that the synergistic
effects of the aniline tetramer and graphene lead to excellent reliability
of the ASC. Significant improvements in the performance of the tetramer
sample were highly related to the improved electrical conductivity
and structural stability over the samples containing the trimer and
dimer electrodes. Given that both high capacitance and excellent cycling
stability are essential to construct the high-performance supercapacitors,
the hybrid ASC consisting of aniline tetramer/WDG can provide promise
for the real-world applications.

Experimental Section
Materials
Aniline (99%), 1-fluoro-4-nitrobenzene (99%),
trimethylamine (TEA, 99.5%), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, 99%), DMSO-d6 (99.9%), ammonium persulfate (98%), iron (iii)
chloride hexahydrate (FeCl3·6H2O, 97%),
hydrazine monohydrate (N2H4, 98%), potassium
hydroxide (KOH, 85%), palladium on carbon (Pd/C), polyvinyl alcohol
(PVA, 99%, Mw: 85 000–124 000),
polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF, Mw: 534 000), N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP), and ethyl acetate (EA) were
purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). Stainless steel
foil (thickness: 0.1 mm) and AC (5 ± 1 μm) were obtained
from MTI Corporation (Richmond, CA, USA.). Hydrochloric acid (HCl,
35–37%), ethanol (95%), and acetone (99%) were purchased from
Daejung Chemical & Metals Co., Ltd. (Siheung, Korea). Graphene
paste was acquired from MExplorer Co., Ltd. (Ansan, Korea), and the
average thickness and lateral size of the graphene sheet are approximately <5
nm and 2–3 μm, respectively.

Synthesis of Aniline Dimer
Aniline (20 mmol), 1-fluoro-4-nitrobenzene
(20 mmol), and TEA (24 mmol) were dissolved in DMSO (15 wt % with
respect to DMSO), and the solution was stirred at 110 °C for
24 h under argon (Ar) atmosphere. The purification was carried out
using chromatography (EA/hexane = 1:1 by volume). The recrystallized
solids were obtained from a methanol solvent. As-prepared recrystallized
solids were dissolved in ethanol (10 wt % with respect to ethanol)
followed by the addition of Pd/C (aniline dimer/Pd/C = 1:0.02 by molar
ratio). When the temperature of the reaction medium reached 120 °C,
N2H4 (aniline dimer/N2H4 = 1:0.02 by molar ratio) was added into the solution, and then vigorously
stirred for 24 h to convert a nitro (NO2) group into a
amine group (NH2). Pd/C catalysts were removed from the
fully reduced aniline dimer by filtration using celite and acetone.
As a result, the precipitates of N-phenyl-1,4-phenylenediamine
(fully reduced form of aniline dimer) were obtained. The precipitates
of N-phenyl-1,4-phenylenediamine were protonated
using 1 M HCl solution. The protonated precipitates were washed several
times using water, ethanol, and acetone solvents.

Synthesis of
Aniline Trimer
N-Phenyl-1,4-phenylenediamine
(20 mmol), 1-fluoro-4-nitrobenzene (20 mmol), and TEA (24 mmol) were
dissolved in DMSO (15 wt % with respect to DMSO), and the solution
was stirred at 110 °C for 24 h under Ar atmosphere. The product
was purified by chromatography (EA/hexane = 1:1 by volume), and the
sample was recrystallized from a methanol solvent. The recrystallized
solids of aniline trimers having a NO2 group were dissolved
in ethanol (10 wt % with respect to ethanol). To reduce a NO2 group of aniline trimers to a NH2 group, N2H4 (aniline trimer/N2H4 = 1:0.02
by molar ratio) was added to the solution followed by vigorous stirring
at 120 °C for 24 h. To promote the reduction process of aniline
trimer, the Pd/C (aniline trimer/Pd/C = 1:0.02 by molar ratio) catalyst
was also added into the solution. Pd/C catalysts were removed from
the fully reduced form of aniline trimers through the celite filtering.
Precipitates of the aniline trimer were protonated using 1 M HCl solution.
The protonated precipitates of aniline trimers were washed several
times using water, ethanol, and acetone solvents.

Synthesis of
Aniline Tetramer
Aniline trimers in the
fully reduced state (20 mmol), 1-fluoro-4-nitrobenzene (20 mmol),
and TEA (24 mmol) were dissolved in DMSO (15 wt % with respect to
DMSO), and the solution was stirred vigorously at 110 °C for
24 h under Ar atmosphere. The chromatography (EA/hexane = 1:1 by volume)
was utilized to purify the product, and the recrystallized sample
was obtained from a methanol solvent. The recrystallized solids of
aniline tetramers having a NO2 group were dissolved in
ethanol (10 wt % with respect to ethanol). To reduce a NO2 group of aniline tetramers to a NH2 group, N2H4 (aniline dimer/N2H4 = 1:0.02
by molar ratio) was added to the solution followed by vigorous stirring
at 120 °C for 24 h. To promote the reduction process of aniline
tetramers, the Pd/C (aniline tetramer/Pd/C = 1:0.02 by molar ratio)
catalyst was also added into the solution. Pd/C catalysts were removed
from the fully reduced aniline tetramer through the celite filtering.
Precipitates of the aniline tetramer were protonated using 1 M HCl
solution. The protonated precipitates of aniline tetramers were washed
several times using water, ethanol, and acetone solvents.

Characterizations
on Aniline Oligomers and WDG Sheets
Morphological images
of the aniline oligomers and WDG sheets were
recorded on a field-emission scanning electron microscope (S-4800,
Hitachi, LTD, Hitachi, Japan). In order to confirm successful formations
of aniline tetramer, aniline trimer, and aniline dimer, NMR analyses
were carried out using on a VNS-600 spectrometer (Varian Inc., Palo
Alto, CA, USA) operating at 600 MHz. To confirm the chemical compositions
and doping states of the aniline oligomers, XPS spectra were measured
on a K-Alpha XPS instrument (Thermo K-Alpha XPS, Thermo Fisher Scientific,
Waltham, MA, U.S.A.). Raman spectra of RGO and WDG sheets were measured
on a T6 (Horiba-Jobin Yvon Co., Tokyo, Japan) spectrometer. Electrical
conductivities of the aniline oligomers and WDG were observed using
a 4-point probe conductivity meter (Mode Systems Co., Hanam, Korea)
equipped with a current source meter (Keithley 2400, Keithley Co.,
Cleveland, OH, USA). The conductivity values were calculated using
the equation σ (S cm–1) = 1/ρ = (ln
2)/(πt)1/R, where ρ, R, and t indicate the static resistivity,
sheet resistivity, and thickness of the sample, respectively.10,11,30,31

Assembly of ASCs Employing Aniline Oligomers and WDG Sheets
Aniline oligomers (0.16 g), such as dimer, trimer, and tetramer,
AC (0.1 g), and PVDF (0.1 g) were dissolved in 9 g of NMP, and the
mixture solution was stirred vigorously at 25 °C for 3 h. As-prepared
pastes of aniline oligomers were treated sonochemically for an hour.
The sonication treatments of the aniline pastes were carried out using
an ultrasonic bath (CPX2800H-E, Branson Ultrasonics Co., Danbury,
CT, U.S.A.) with 110 W power and 40 kHz frequency. Aniline oligomers
(0.1 mL) and WDG (0.1 mL) were deposited on each 2 cm2 of
the stainless steel foil, and these samples were dried at 25 °C
using a vacuum oven. The thin films obtained from the aniline oligomer
and the WDG sheet had thicknesses of 1.8 and 1.2 μm, respectively.
The PVA film was immersed in 1 M KOH solution for 3 h. The aniline
oligomer (cathode), WDG sheet (anode), and PVA–KOH electrolyte
membrane were combined for the fabrication of ASC, which were sealed
using a hydraulic pressing machine (HP, Ilshin Autoclave, Co., Ltd.,
Daejeon, Korea.).

Electrochemical Measurements
Evaluation
of the electrochemical
characteristics on the ASCs was conducted using a ZIVE SP2 electrochemical
workstation (WonAtech, Seoul, Korea). Cyclic voltammograms (CVs) of
the samples were measured from 0 and 2.0 V at scan rates 10 from 90
mV s–1. Galvanostatic charge/discharge experiments
were performed by cycling the potential from 0 to 2.0 V at currents
from 83 to 830 mA/cm3. Areal specific capacitances (CA’s) of the ASCs were calculated using
the equation CA (mF/cm2) = IΔt/AΔV.1,22−27 Volumetric specific capacitances (CV’s) of the ASCs were calculated using the equation CV (mF/cm3) = IΔt/LΔV.1,22−27 In the equations of CA and CV, the terms I, Δt, ΔV, A, and L and indicate the applied current, discharging time, potential window,
electrode area, and electrode volume, respectively. Energy density
of the ASC was estimated according to the equation E (W h/cm3) = CVΔV2/2, where CV and
ΔV indicate the volumetric capacitance of each
ASC and voltage drop upon discharge, respectively.1,22−27 Power density of the ASC was calculated according to the equation P (W/cm3) = E/t, where E and t indicate the energy
density and discharging time of each ASC, respectively.1,22−27 Electrochemical impedance spectra of the electrochemical cells were
analyzed in the frequency range of 1 MHz to 10 mHz.
