Some quaternary gemini amphiphiles
(GAs) were synthesized as nonviral
gene delivery carriers. The critical miceller concentration values
of these amphiphiles are indicative of their superior surface-active
properties. All of the synthesized GAs, alone or along with lipids
like cholesterol and/or dioleoylphosphatidyl ethanolamine (DOPE),
were formulated as liposomes. Formulations of GAs with DOPE showed
average particle diameters of 326–400 nm with positive ζ-potential
(30.1–46.4 mV). The lipoplexes of theses formulations showed
complete pDNA retention at the base at a N/P ratio higher than 1.0
in gel retardation study. The GAs were effective in condensing pDNA
into a ψ-phase, as indicated by circular dichroism study, and
provided complete protection of the pDNA against the enzyme DNase
at a N/P ratio more than 1. In vitro cell line studies showed that
GA liposomal formulations caused β-gal expression and offered
a higher transfection efficiency than that of liposomes prepared with
the help of N-[1-(2,3-dioleoyloxy)propyl]-N,N,N-trimethylammonium
methyl-sulfate (DOTAP)/DOPE and dicyclocarbodiimide (DCC)/DOPE but
comparable to those of Lipofectamine 2000 in A549 and HeLa cell lines.
Modulation of head group polarity significantly affected the transfection
efficacy of GAs. The cell viabilities of almost all of the formulations
were comparable to those of the standards (DCC/DOPE and DOTAP/DOPE
liposomes). Incorporation of cholesterol [GA/DOPE/cholesterol in the
ratio of 1:1:1] further improved the serum compatibility of the formulations
and improved the transfection efficacy when evaluated in A549 and
HeLa cell lines. Fluorescence-assisted cell sorting studies showed
comparable number of transfected cells to Lipofectamine 2000 in the
HeLa cell line. Intracellular trafficking studies using confocal microscopy
indicated transfection of the HeLa cells with the reporter gene within
30 min of lipoplex treatment. γ-Scintigraphy using 99mTc-labeled lipoplexes showed higher concentrations of the lipoplexes
in vital tissues like liver, spleen, lungs, and kidneys.

1 Introduction
Gene therapy, a unique therapeutic approach, has been exploited
for the treatment of inherited as well as acquired diseases.1 In gene therapy, there is importance of the availability
of (i) the therapeutic gene that could be expressed at the targeted
location and (ii) the delivery system that should be safe and efficient
and having the ability to deliver the therapeutic gene to the targeted
organ.2,3 A formulation is always desirable having
the ability to deliver a therapeutic gene (trans-gene) to the selected
cells where expression of that gene is intended, through intravenous
administration.

Delivery of the naked DNA to the targeted site
is notably inhibited
by the factors like the size, shape, and polyanionic charge of the
DNA and its susceptibility to the serum nucleases.3 Both viral and nonviral vectors have been utilized to solve
the problems associated with the delivery of the naked DNA. The clinical
applications of viral vectors are hampered due to factors like immunogenicity,
mutagenicity, host rejection, inability to transfect the nondividing
cells, possible oncogenicity, and limited DNA cargo carrying capacity
of the viral vectors.4−7 Nonviral vectors including physical and chemical techniques have
been developed to solve the problems associated with viral vectors.
Physical techniques involve the implementation of physical forces
for gene delivery, whereas the chemical techniques involve the utilization
of polymeric, lipidic, and other amphiphilic carrier systems. Polymeric
carriers such as poly[l-lysine], polyethylenimine, chitosan,
dextran, poly(β-aminoesters), poly[2-(dimethyalamino)ethyl methacrylate],
polyesters, poloxamers, poly(d,l-lactide-co-glycolide), etc. and lipophilic carriers such as quaternary
ammonium lipids, lipoamines, and amidinium lipids are utilized for
gene delivery applications.8−12

Among the amphiphilic carrier systems, bisquaternary gemini
amphiphiles
(GAa) is a category of cationic gene delivery carriers, which has
been studied extensively.1 GAs offer better
surfactant properties in comparison with the corresponding single-chain-,
single-head-containing monovalent compounds. This can make them useful
for biomedical applications demanding a better safety profile.13 The initial optimization step for such compounds
is to reduce their in vivo concentration in the living system. Using
lesser amount of a compound to get the same level of effect also has
economic advantage. Moreover, bisquaternary GAs have the advantage
of being prepared with ease with a variety of possible structural
modifications as they are composed of three basic units, namely, the
head, the spacer, and the hydrocarbon chain, allowing greater flexibility
in the design of GAs, possessing properties like high stability in
biological fluids, less toxicity, low immunogenicity, and biodegradability,
which are the essential requirements for any gene delivery system.14,15 The bivalent positive charge in the head group of GAs allows efficient
complexation and compaction of polyanionic DNA into particles (lipoplexes)
of small sizes that can easily be endocytosed by the target cells.16 The nature, length, and stereochemistry of the
spacer also have noteworthy effect on the transfection efficacy of
GAs.17,18 Optimization of the desired characteristics
of a GA can be done by modulating the hydrophobic group, the head
group, and the linker chain. These lipophilic amphiphiles can have
a variety of structural features in terms of the type of the lipophilic
hydrocarbon chain, the head group linker, and the cationic head group.
Therefore, the modular approach is useful for planning and designing
new amphiphile vectors for gene delivery.

Chemical alterations
in the head group in the structure of the
cationic amphiphiles show significant enhancement in the transfection
efficiency. For instance, hydroxyethylation of the cationic head group
has proven to substantially improve the transfection efficiency.19 The gene transfection efficiency of the lipids, N-[1-(2,3-dioleyloxy)propyl]-N,N,N-trimethylammonium chloride and N-[1-(2,3-dioleoyloxy)propyl]-N,N,N-trimethylammonium methyl-sulfate (DOTAP),
was further enhanced by adding a hydroxyethyl group to get vectors
like 1,2-dioleoyl-3-dimethylhydroxyethylammonium bromide and 1,2-dioleoyloxypropyl-3-dimethylhydroxyethylammonium
chloride, respectively.20,21 The literature showed
that both monohydroxylation and dihydroxylation of the head group
resulted in higher transfection compared to that from the corresponding
nonhydroxyethylated amphiphiles. Monohydroxylated lipid N,N-di-n-hexadecyl-N-methyl-N-(2-hydroxyethyl)ammonium chloride22 and dihydroxylated lipid N,N-di-n-hexadecyl-N,N-dihydroxyethylammonium bromide23 were found to impart high levels of gene transfection efficacy,
compared with a structurally similar dioctadecyldimethylammonium bromide
(DDAB). The hydroxyethyl group can also be derived from lactic acid
saccharides. The lipid N,N-myristyl-N-(1-hydroxyprop-2-yl)-N-methylammonium
chloride, in which the hydroxyethyl portion has been derived from
lactic acid, has been observed to be doubly efficient when compared
with DDAB/dioleoylphosphatidyl ethanolamine (DOPE) in the in vitro
studies.24 In the lipids 1-deoxy-1-[methyl(ditetradecyl)ammonio]-D-arabinitol and 1-deoxy-1-[dihexadecyl(methyl)ammonio]-D-xylitol, which are derivatives of arabinose and xylose,
respectively, addition of more than two hydroxyethyl moieties in the
head group was found to be responsible for higher transfection levels
and decreased toxicity.25

Apart from
the modular design of the amphiphiles for the required
structural features for efficient gene delivery, the formulation factors
are equally important. Dioleoylphosphatidyl ethanolamine (DOPE) and
cholesterol have shown promising results when formulated along with
the cationic carriers including gemini amphiphiles.26 These helper components of the formulation favor endosomal
escape of the lipoplexes, which is one of the decisive steps in the
gene delivery by different mechanisms.27,28

Keeping
the above points in mind and taking advantage of the modular
structure of the gemini amphiphiles, it was decided to synthesize
two series of amphiphiles having different sizes of the spacer by
varying the distance between the two cationic heads. In each series,
the nature of the head group was systematically changed from nonpolar
(i.e., methyl) to polar [i.e., monohydroxyethyl and di(hydroxyethyl)]
and the lipophilicity of the cationic head was also varied by attaching
hydrocarbon chains of different lengths (from C12 to C18). The idea was to see the effect of changes in polarity
of the head group and lipophilicity of the cationic heads of the GAs
of the two series (having different lengths of the spacer) on the
transfection efficacy and cytotoxicity of the resulting GAs (Figures 1 and 2).

by thin layer chromatography (TLC) on silica gel plates (60 F254; Merck), visualizing with iodine vapors. A Veego make silicon
oil bath-type melting point apparatus was used to determine the melting
points and are uncorrected. The IR spectra were recorded using attenuated
total reflectance and KBr disc methods for liquid and solid samples,
respectively, on a Bruker FT-IR spectrometer, model alpha. The PMR
spectra were recorded using a Bruker 300 MHz spectrometer in deuterated
solvents (CDCl3 and DMSO-d6) (chemical shifts in δ ppm; s is used for a singlet; m, for
a multiplet; t, for a triplet; bs, for a broad singlet; bm, for a
broad multiplet; and bt, for a broad triplet). Mass spectral data
were obtained on a scientific mass spectrometer (Thermo, DSQ II).
Elemental analyses were performed on a Thermo Fisher FLASH 2000 organic
elemental analyzer. All of the final GAs offered results within ±0.4%
of the calculated values of carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen elements.

2.2.2 Determination of Critical
Miceller Concentration
(cmc)
Conductance was measured as a function of GA concentration
using digital conductivity meter 306 (Equiptronic, Mumbai) having
a cell constant of 1.01 cm–1 S at 30 ± 0.2
°C. Serial dilutions of GAs covering the range of 10–3–10–6 mM were prepared in double-distilled
water, and conductance of the solutions so prepared was measured.
The value of specific conductance of the solutions was plotted against
the concentrations. The inflection point in the graph yielded the
“cmc” values for the GAs under study.30,31

2.2.3 Preparation of GA Formulations (Liposomes)
Two types of formulations were prepared, one using the GAs alone
and the second type consisting of a GA in combination with the helper
lipid DOPE in molar ratios of 1:1, 1:2, and 1:3 (GA/DOPE). Required
quantities of GAs and DOPE were dissolved in a mixture of solvent
(chloroform/methanol, 1:1) in glass vials such that the total lipid
quantity (GA plus DOPE) remained constant. The solvent was evaporated
under a stream of nitrogen. Residual amounts of the solvent were removed
from the samples by applying vacuum overnight. The resulting dry films
were hydrated using 20 mM (4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic
acid) (HEPES) buffer (pH 7.4) and incubated for 30 min at ∼70
°C, followed by vigorous vortexing and repeated freeze–thawing
(ice cold water to ∼70 °C) with intermittent vortexing
to ensure hydration. The resulting suspensions were sonicated for
3 min and passed through polycarbonate filters (0.22 μm) 2–3
times.

For the purpose of observing the transfection efficacy
of the synthesized GAs in the presence of serum, a third type of formulation
containing cholesterol was prepared. Cholesterol was also included
as a helper lipid in the optimized GA/DOPE formulations such that
the final formulations contained GA/DOPE/cholesterol in molar ratios
of 1:1:1 and 1:1:0.5.18,32

2.2.4 Preparation
of Lipoplexes
Lipoplexes
were prepared by mixing the freshly prepared formulations of the cationic
GAs with plasmid DNA under gentle vortexing in DMEM at different N/P
ratios (0.5, 1, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, 4.0, and 6.0) and then incubating
the mixtures at 37 °C for 15 min. The N/P ratio is defined as
the molar ratio of the nitrogen contents in the cationic GAs to the
phosphorus contents of the anionic pDNA. All of the complexes (lipoplexes)
were prepared keeping the quantity of pDNA constant and varying the
quantity of the formulations. However, the volumes of the cationic
formulations and the pDNA dilutions were kept constant during lipoplex
preparation. Characterizations and the experiments for transfection
were performed immediately after incubation of the lipoplexes.32,33

2.2.5 Assessment of Degree of Complexation of
pDNA with the GAs
Agarose gel was used for assessing the
DNA-binding ability of the cationic GAs by the gel retardation assay
(1%, prestained with ethidium bromide, 0.1%) across varying N/P ratios
from 0.25 to 8. pDNA (pCMV·SPORT-β-gal, 300 ng) was complexed
with GA formulations containing different amounts of cationic GAs
in HEPES buffer (pH 7.4, total volume 20 μL) and incubated for
20–25 min at room temperature. A loading buffer (4 μL)
(0.25% bromophenol blue in 40% w/v sucrose in water) was added, and
the resulting solution (24 μL) was loaded on each well. Electrophoresis
of the samples was performed with Tris–acetate buffer at 80
V for 40 min. DNA bands were visualized in the gel documentation unit.34,35

2.2.6 Evaluation of pDNA Protection Capacity of
Lipoplexes Against DNase I Enzyme
To obtain a suitable N/P
ratio for the GAs that would protect the pDNA from degradation, GA
formulations containing different amounts of GAs were complexed with
pDNA (1000 ng) in HEPES buffer (pH 7.4, 30 μL total volume).
The complexes were incubated at room temperature for 30 min on a rotary
shaker. The lipoplexes so prepared were given a treatment of DNase
I (1 μg/mL, 30 μL, 10 μL) and MgCl2 (20
mM) and incubated for 20 min at 37 °C. The hydrolytic reaction
was then stopped by adding EDTA (50 mM), and the containers were incubated
for 10 min at 60 °C in a water bath. The aqueous layer was washed
with a phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol mixture (25:24:1 v/v 50 μL)
and centrifuged at 10 000 rpm for 5 min. The aqueous supernatants
were separated, loaded (25 μL) on a 1% agarose gel (prestained
with ethidium bromide), and electrophoresed at 100 V for 1 h.35

2.2.7 Assessment of Condensation
of pDNA in the
Lipoplexes Using Circular Dichroism (CD) Studies
CD experiments
were performed to assess the conformational changes occurring in DNA
upon binding with the GAs using a circular dichroism spectrometer
(JASCO-J815), in the range of 320–200 nm with a scanning speed
of 50 nm/min, band width of 1 nm, and response of 1 s using a quartz
cuvette of cell length 0.2 cm.36,37

Serial dilution
of pDNA and GAs were prepared in HEPES buffer (pH 7.4) and mixed to
achieve different N/P ratios. The CD spectra were obtained at T = 303 K immediately after addition of pDNA to the liposomal
suspension (t = 0) and after 30 min. A positive band
near 277 nm and a negative band near 245 nm indicate a typical B-form
of DNA in the CD spectrum in the absence of the GAs.18,38

2.2.8 In Vitro Cell Line Studies
2.2.8.1 Transfection Studies for Evaluating Transfection
Efficacy of the Synthesized GAs Using β-Gal Reporter Gene Assay
in the Absence of Serum
To evaluate the transfection efficiency
of the cationic GAs alone and their formulations to induce gene expression
in HeLa and A549 cells, pCMV·SPORT-β-gal (300 ng) was used
to form lipoplexes at various N/P ratios (1–6).23,39 The cells were seeded in 96-well plates at a density of 5000 cells/well
in DMEM (200 μL) growth medium and penicillin–streptomycin–amphotericin
B (1%) solution. After 18–24 h, the cells were treated with
the diluted lipoplexes in 200 μL plain DMEM per well. After
4 h of incubation of the formulation, the culture media were removed,
cells were washed with PBS (pH 7.4), and complete growth medium (200
μL) was added to each well. Culture media were removed after
a time span of 48 h, and cells were washed with PBS (pH 7.4) and lysed
(using lysis buffer 0.5% Nonidet P-40 in Tris buffer, pH 8.0, 50 μL).
The cells were further treated with ONPG solution (2×, 50 μL),
a substrate for β-galactosidase. The intensity of yellow color
was recorded after 15 min of incubation at 37 °C in an enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay plate reader (Biorad, Model 680 XR) at 405 nm.
Naked DNA transfected cells were used as the negative control in all
of the experiments.22,24

2.2.8.2 Transfection
Studies in the Presence of
Serum
To evaluate the serum compatibility of lipoplexes containing
the optimized GA/DOPE ratio, transfection studies were performed in
the presence of FBS (10%), whereas other variables were kept constant,
as described in the case of transfection studies in the absence of
serum.

2.2.8.3 MTT Assay for Cytotoxicity
Evaluation
The 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide
(MTT) reduction assay was used to assess the cytotoxicity of all of
the GA formulations. The ratio of the number of cells to the quantum
of GA formulation was maintained constant in the cytotoxicity assay,
which was performed in 96-well plates in the transfection experiments.
After 4 h of incubation of the formulation treatment, the culture
media were removed, cells were washed with PBS (pH 7.4), and complete
growth medium (200 μL) was added to each well. After 48 h, the
culture medium was removed, cells were washed with PBS (pH 7.4), MTT
solution (50 μL, 1 mg/mL in plain DMEM) was added to each well,
and the plate was incubated at 37 °C for 4 h. After incubation,
DMEM was removed and DMSO (100 μL) was added to each well. The
purple formazan crystals formed in the plate were dissolved using
mechanical stirring. The optical density was measured at 570 nm keeping
the reference at 650 nm using a plate reader. The percent of cell
viability was calculated using the formula given below32,40,41  

2.2.8.4 Fluorescence-Assisted
Cell Sorting (FACS)
Studies
Twenty four-well plates were used for seeding the
cells at a density of 50 000 cells/well in DMEM growth medium
(1 mL) supplemented with FBS (10%) and penicillin–streptomycin–amphotericin
B (1%) solution. After 18–24 h, the cells were treated with
diluted lipoplexes in plain DMEM (500 μL) per well. After 4
h of incubation of the lipoplex formulation treatment, the culture
medium was removed, cells were washed with PBS (pH 7.4), and complete
growth medium (1 mL) was added to each well. The cells were processed
for FACS analysis using the protocol reported by Soboleski et al.
in the absence of light to prevent quenching of fluorescence.42,43

2.2.8.5 Intracellular Trafficking Study Using
Confocal Microscopy
Cells were cultured in complete growth
media in 6-well plates containing a glass cover slip and seeded with
2 × 105 cells per well. After attaining the required
confluency, cells were transfected with transfection medium (lipoplex
of optimized formulation at an optimized N/P ratio with YOYO-tagged
pDNA). After different time intervals (10, 20, and 30 min), cells
were washed with 1× PBS (1 mL) (three times) and treated with
paraformaldehyde (1 mL, 4%) for 10 min to fix the cells. Paraformaldehyde
was removed, and the cells were washed with 1× PBS (1 mL) (three
times), treated with nuclear staining dye DAPI (0.7 mL) for 1 h, and
washed with 1× PBS (1 mL) (three times). Cover slips were mounted
on glass slides, and fluorescence was viewed and photographed on a
confocal microscope (Zeiss, LSM-510 META, Germany) using an argon
laser at an excitation wavelength of 488 nm and emission wavelength
of 520 nm.44,45

2.2.9 In
Vivo Studies
2.2.9.1 Optimization of Radiolabeling
of the Lipoplexes
by Direct Labeling Procedure
The radiolabeling of the lipoplexes
at the optimized N/P ratios was carried out using a direct labeling
procedure with 99mTc by the simple reduction method using
stannous chloride. Lipoplexes were prepared by mixing the required
amount of liposomal suspension in Milli-Q water (0.25 mL) and pDNA
(15 μg) in Milli-Q water (0.25 mL). After 20 min, reduced 99mTc (in saline) was added to achieve a final concentration
of 2.5 mCi/mL. Stannous chloride (60 μg) solution was used to
reduce 99mTc followed by bicarbonate buffer (0.1 mL, 0.5
M, pH 9.0) to maintain the final pH to 6.0–6.5.

The labeling
was carried out by mixing the reagents for 10–15 min at ambient
temperature. Radiolabeling efficiency/radiochemical purity of the
labeled complex was estimated by the ITLC chromatography technique.
To achieve stable labeling with higher yields, the labeling protocol
was standardized by varying reagent concentrations.46,47

2.2.9.2 Biodistribution Studies
Biodistribution
studies of 99mTc-labeled lipoplexes were carried out according
to the method approved by local IAEC of the Institute of Nuclear Medicine
and Allied Sciences, Ministry of Defence, Government of India, India.
Balb/C mice were injected with 99mTc-labeled lipoplexes
(0.2 mL per animal) by tail vein. Blood was withdrawn by cardiac puncture
after different time intervals, and the animals were sacrificed by
cervical dislocation. Subsequently, brain and other tissues (stomach,
intestine, spleen, liver, lungs, kidney, and tail) were dissected
and washed twice using normal saline to remove the adhering tissue/fluid
and weighed. The radioactivity present in each organ was measured
using a γ-scintillation counter (Capintec). Three animals were
used for each time point (1, 6, and 24 h) for every formulation. Radioactivity
uptake in each organ was measured as a fraction of the dose of the
radiopharmaceutical administered by using the following equation46,48  

2.2.9.3 γ-Scintigraphic Study in Rabbits
For γ-scintigraphic
studies, a rabbit was administered with
0.3 mL of the optimized 99mTc-lebelled lipoplex of the
formulation intravenously through ear vein. The animal was anesthetized
using diazepam (0.5 mL of 10 mg/mL) intramuscular injection. SPECT,
LC 75-005 (Diacam, Siemens AG, Erlanger, Germany) was used for the
purpose of imaging after 30 min of administration of the radiolabeled
formulation to the animals.46,48

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Chemical Aspects
The chemical structure
of a cationic surfactant affects not only the formulation aspects
but also the transfection efficacy in the gene delivery systems. Along
with the double positive charge, the modular structure offers the
opportunity to design GAs in a rational way. In the current work,
it was planned to synthesize two series of GAs. In series-I, the spacer
chain length was kept as four methylene carbons, whereas in series-II,
the chain length was increased to six methylene carbons. In both the
series, it was decided to initially synthesize a limited number of
GAs in which head groups’ polarity was increased stepwise while
maintaining the length of the cationic hydrocarbon to C16 (series-I: 5a, 5b, and 5f; series-II: 6a, 6b, and 6f). PMR spectra of 5a–6g are shown
in Figures 1S–15S, Supporting Information.
After assessing the transfection efficacy of the reporter gene in
the isolated cell culture, of the formulations containing the initially
synthesized GAs, it was observed that the monohydroxyethyl head group
(5b and 6b) offered the best results followed
by the di(hydroethyl) heads (5f and 6f).
Considering these results, the head group polarity was kept constant
(monohydroxyethyl) and the chain length of the lipophilic hydrocarbon
was varied from C12 to C18, leading to the synthesis
of all four compounds of the hydroxyethyl group in each series while
some selected additional compounds were also synthesized for the more
polar di(hydroxyethyl) head group in both the series. A total of 15
GAs were synthesized for the present work, as given in Figure 3. The intermediate tertiary
amines were either procured commercially (3a) or synthesized
(3b–3h) as per the scheme given in Figure 3. The four/six carbon
chain linkers were attached by reacting the tertiary amines (3b–3h) with the respective dibromoalkanes
(4a and 4b) to obtain compounds of both
of the series (series I and II).

compounds of series I and
II.

3.2 Formulation
Aspects
3.2.1 Determination of Critical Miceller Concentration
(cmc) of the Synthesized GAs
The cmc values (Table 1S, Supporting Information) of the synthesized
GAs were determined by the conductometric method30,49 by plotting specific conductance vs the concentrations of the GAs
(Figure 16S, Supporting Information). cmc
is affected by all of the three structural variables, i.e., polarity
of the head group, chain length of the spacer, and the length of the
nonpolar hydrocarbon. An increase in the chain length of the spacer
causes an increase in the cmc, whereas an increase in the length of
the nonpolar hydrocarbon from C12 to C18 causes
a decrease in cmc of the resulting GAs. An increase in the polarity
of the head group from methyl to hydroxyethyl causes an increase in
cmc, but a further increase in the polarity by attaching two hydroxyethyl
groups causes a decrease in cmc. Overall, cmc of the synthesized GAs
(1.1 × 10–6–3.6 × 10–5) was found to be much superior to that of the monomeric counterparts
like cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (1.3 × 10–3 M).

3.2.2 Preparation of Formulations (Liposomal)
of GAs
All of the synthesized GAs were formulated as liposomes
all alone (plain GAs) and in combination with the helper lipid DOPE
in different molar ratios (1:1, 1:2, and 1:3) in a buffer system (HEPES,
20 mM, pH 7.4). DOPE was selected as the helper lipid due to its fusogenic
property at the endosomal stage.27 Different
molar ratios of DOPE were tried to get the best results in terms of
transfection efficacy. The buffer system (HEPES, 20 mM) was selected
to maintain the pH of the formulations to 7.4. The nonionic nature
of HEPES did not provide any hindrance during lipoplex preparation
with pDNA.

Serum is known to decrease the transfection efficacy
of a gene delivery carrier, whereas cholesterol is known to impart
serum compatibility to gene delivery carriers.50 For improving the transfection efficacy of the synthesized
GAs in serum, cholesterol was also incorporated in the GA formulations
in two different molar ratios, i.e., GA/DOPE/cholesterol in the ratios
of 1:1:1 and 1:1:0.5. Three standard formulations, DOTAP/DOPE (1.37
mU), DCC/DOPE (1.68 mU), and Lipofectamine 2000 (2.07 mU), alone were
used as positive controls.

3.2.3 Preparation and Characterization
of Lipoplexes
Lipoplexes of GA formulations were prepared
with plasmid DNA (pCMV·SPORT-β-gal)
at different N/P ratios (0.25–6.0). The N/P ratio is defined
as the molar ratio of the nitrogen contents in the carbonic GA to
the phosphorus contents of the anionic pDNA. All of the complexes
were prepared keeping the quantity of the pDNA constant and varying
the quantity of GAs in the formulations. The volumes of the cationic
formulations and pDNA dilutions were also kept constant during the
lipoplex preparation.32,33

Electrostatic interactions
between the negatively charged pDNA and cationic liposomes as a function
of N/P ratios were assessed by the electrophoretic gel retardation
assay. In this study, the uncomplexed pDNA would move out of the well,
whereas the complexed pDNA would remain inside the well.35 The typical electrostatic patterns for formulations
of two GAs (5a, 5f) have been shown in Figure 4. Lane 1 showed plain
pDNA that moved out of the well under the influence of electrostatic
force. Other lanes exhibited different levels of retardation of pDNA
as the N/P ratio increased from 0.25 to 3.0. Complete 100% pDNA retardation
has been observed for all of the GA formulations at N/P of 1.0 and
higher. No effect of head group polarity, spacer chain length, or
hydrocarbon chain length was observed in the gel retardation pattern
at similar N/P ratios for different GA formulations.

ratios under gel electrophoresis: (A) 5a and (B) 5f. Lane 1: plasmid DNA alone; lanes 2–8: plasmid DNA
with GAs (N/P ratio of 0.25–3.0).

DNase I digestion studies were performed to assess the pDNA
protection
behavior of the GA formulations in the lipoplexes. A crucial point
for obtaining high transfection efficacy is to safeguard the therapeutic
genes undamaged.51,52 The results have been shown in Figure 5. Lane 1 shows the
naked pDNA without the DNase I treatment. At a N/P ratio of 0.5, all
of the lipolexes formulated with GA formulations have shown complete
degradation of pDNA. At a N/P ratio of 1, the GAs could protect about
90% of pDNA, whereas complete protection of the pDNA was observed
with N/P ratio of more than 1. Treatment of the naked pDNA with DNase
I caused its complete degradation. No effect of head group polarity
and chain length of the spacer or the hydrocarbon was observed in
this study.

Circular dichroism (CD) spectra provide information about
the double-stranded
DNA helical conformation. Cationic amphiphiles bind to the native
β-form of the DNA and induce changes in the secondary structure
in such a way that the number of base pairs/turns is reduced from
10 to 9.33.37 Positive and negative bands
near 277 and 245 nm, respectively, are exhibited by the pDNA in HEPES
buffer. Condensation of DNA into a chiral ψ-phase is indicated
by an overall shift of the spectrum to higher wavelengths, an enhanced
negative band, and flattening of the positive band.36 Addition of GA formulations causes change in the β-form
to ψ-form, as can be visualized from Figure 17S (Supporting Information). An increase in the N/P ratio
causes more condensation. An effective complexation of DNA and liposomes
would cause compaction of the nucleic acid that would help in the
penetration of the DNA into the target cell due to reduction in its
size. Simberg et al. demonstrated that formulation of the compact
ψ-DNA helped in efficient delivery of genes.39 Results of the CD experiment demonstrate clearly that all
of the three initially synthesized GAs (5a, 5b, and 5f) are effective in condensing pDNA into the
ψ-phase. Under the same experimental conditions, 5b showed more effective condensation than the remaining two.

3.3 In Vitro Cell Line Studies
3.3.1 Assessment
of Transfection Efficacy of the
Lipoplexes [in the Absence of Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS)]
The
transfection efficacy of the lipoplexes prepared from different GA
formulations was evaluated in A549 and HeLa cell lines, using the
β-gal reporter plasmid. There were two variables used for each
GA formulation. One variable was the absence or presence of DOPE as
a helper lipid in the ratios of GA/DOPE as 1:1, 1:2, or 1:3 respectively.
The second variable was the use of GA formulations in N/P ratios of
0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6. The amount of β-galactosidase enzyme
expressed in the cells transfected with the β-gal reporter plasmid
is directly proportional to the transfection efficacy of the concerned
GA used as the gene delivery carrier.25 The results showed that all of the GAs exhibited β-gal expression
when formulated along with DOPE (Figures 18S–32S; Supporting Information). This may be due to early release of the
lipoplex at the endosomal stage inside the cells.26 It is evident from Table 1 that higher β-gal expression has taken place
in HeLa than in A549 cell lines. This may be due to higher propensity
of HeLa cells for transfection in comparison to that of A54 cells.
GAs of series I caused better expression of the reporter protein than
the GAs of series-II.

3.3.1.1 Effect of Head Group
Variations in GAs
on the Transfection Efficacy
Modulation in head group polarity
affects the transfection efficacy of the GAs significantly. For instance,
incorporation of an hydroxyethyl group in place of a methyl group
in the head group region (HG1 and HG2) of the GAs having the C4 spacer and C16 hydrocarbon chain increases the
transfection efficacy [e.g., 5a (no hydroxyethyl group), 5b (one hydroxyethyl group), and 5f (two hydroxyethyl
groups) showed the expression of 0.94, 1.11, and 1.02 in A549 and
1.02, 1.83, and 1.04 in HeLa cell lines, respectively]. However, there
was a little decrease in transfection efficacy on moving from one
hydroxyethyl to two hydroxyethyl groups per quaternary nitrogen while
maintaining the hydrocarbon chain length constant (C16).
Same observations were made in formulations made with GAs having the
C6 spacer. The transfection efficacy of all of the GA formulations
was greatly increased by incorporation of DOPE into the formulations
as the helper liquid. Incorporation of DOPE greatly reduced the molar
concentrations (low N/P) of the GAs in the formulations to achieve
the highest transfection efficacies, in general.

3.3.1.2 Effect of Chain Length Variation of the
Spacer
Changes in the second variable in the GA structures,
i.e., length of the spacer, showed a significant effect on the transfection
efficacy of the GA formulations. Change of the spacer from (CH2)4 to (CH2)6 caused a decrease
in transfection efficacies of all of the GA formulations in the absence
as well as in the presence of DOPE (Table 2).

3.3.1.3 Effect
of Variations in Hydrocarbon Chain
Length
Hydrocarbon chain length, the third variable in the
structures of the GAs, also exhibited noticeable effects on the transfection
efficacies of the GA formulations. In the (CH2)4 series (series I) with the same head group (monohydroxyethyl) (5b, 5c, 5d, and 5e),
the order of transfection efficacy remained as 5d > 5b > 5c > 5e in the A549 cell
line
and 5b > 5d > 5c ≥ 5e in the HeLa cell lines with values of 1.32 > 1.11 >
0.29
> 0.11 and 1.83 > 1.56 > 0.48 ≥ 0.48, respectively,
whereas
the order remained as 6b > 6d > 6e > 6c in the 549 cell line and 6d > 6b > 6e > 6c in
HeLa cell lines
with the values of 1.01 > 0.79 > 0.27 > 0.22 and 1.40 >
1.24 > 0.45
> 0.26, respectively, in the formulations of (CH2)6 series when the GAs were used all alone. When DOPE was included
in the formulations as a helper lipid, the order of efficacy for the
(CH2)4 series of GAs was observed as 5d > 5b > 5c > 5d in
both the
cell lines and for the (CH2)6 series the order
was 6d > 6b > 6e > 6c in A549 cell lines and 6b > 6d > 6e > 6c in the HeLa cell lines.
This finding
suggested that the transaction efficacy of the GAs having different
size hydrocarbon chain length followed the order C14 ≈
C16 > C18 > C12 when the head
group
and the spacer were kept constant.

GA formulations containing
optimum ratios of the helper lipid DOPE were compared with the expression
of naked β-gal plasmid (pDNA) (without making lipolex) as negative
control and commercially available transfection reagents (Lipofectamine
2000; DCC/DOPE; and DOTAP/DOPE liposomes) as positive controls. Naked
pDNA showed negligible β-gal expression of 0.04 and 0.077 mU
in A549 and HeLA cell lines, respectively. Various formulations of
the synthesized GAs showed good expression. They exhibited higher
or comparable levels of expression to DOTAP/DOPE liposomes (1.37 and
1.94 in A549 and HeLa cell lines, respectively) and to DCC/DOPE liposomes
(1.68 and 1.94 in A549 and HeLA cell lines, respectively). However,
some formulations (5d, 5b, and 5f) exhibited higher or comparable β-gal expression to Lipofectamine
2000 (2.07 and 3.12 in A549 and HeLa cell lines, respectively).

3.3.2 Evaluation of Transfection Efficacy of Some
Selected Formulations in Serum
Serum is known to decrease
the transfection efficacy of gene delivery carriers. Transfection
efficacies of the optimized GA formulations showing the best result
in A459 and HeLa cell lines in the absence of serum in the previous
experiments were evaluated in the presence of 10% FBS. A decrease
in transfection efficacy was noted in both the cell lines in the presence
of serum for the selected GA formulations (Table 2). The standard formulations (DCC/DOPE and
DOTAP/DOPE) also showed significant reductions in their transfection
efficacies in the presence of serum.

Cholesterol is known to
impart serum compatibility to gene delivery carriers.50 In our quest to improve transfection efficacies in the
presence of serum, GAs exhibiting the best results (5b and 5d) were reformulated to include cholesterol. New
formulations were prepared to include two different concentrations
of cholesterol in the ratios such as GA/DOPE/cholesterol of 1:1:1
and 1:1:0.5. The transfection efficacies were checked for both of
these formulations in the absence and presence of 10% FBS in both
the cell lines (Table 2).

It could be observed that reduction in the efficacy of the
enzyme
expression did take place in the presence of serum even in the new
formulations containing cholesterol in both the cell lines. However,
addition of cholesterol in the ratio of 1:1:1 (GA/DOPE/cholesterol)
definitely improved the transfection efficacy of the new formulations
[1.72 vs 1.40 mU for 5d in the A549 cell line and 3.39
vs 2.37 mU in the HeLa cell line; 1.44 vs 1.37 mU for 5b in the A549 cell line and 2.45 vs 2.18 in the Hela cell line; Tables 1 and 2].

3.3.3 Assessment of Cell Toxicity
Due to GAs Using
MTT Assay
Cell safety (or toxicity) is an important parameter
in selecting a suitable GA for gene delivery. A good GA should exhibit
not only a high transfection efficacy but also minimal level of toxicity.
Some selected GAs in formulations having DOPE in ratios 1:1, 1:2,
and 1:3 (DOPE/GA) at different N/P ratios were evaluated for their
safety profile in A549 and HeLa cell lines using the MTT assay. Cell
viability of the control cells without GA treatment was considered
as 100%. As the N/P ratio of the lipoplexes increased from 0.5 to
6, cell viability decreased in both of the cell lines for all of the
formulations. Cell viabilities of all of the optimized GA formulations
have been evaluated and compared with those of the standard (DCC/DOPE
and DOTAP/DOPE liposomes) in A549 and HeLa cell lines in Figures 6 and 7. The cell viabilities of almost all of the formulations were
comparable to those shown by the two standard formulations. DCC/DOPE
and DOTAP/DOPE liposomes showed cell viabilities of 82.6 and 87.2
and 83.38 and 89.2% in A549 and HeLa cell lines, respectively. The
cell viabilities were found to be independent of the chain length
of the hydrocarbon tails, polarity of the cationic head, or the length
of spacer of the GAs.

3.4 Fluorescence-Assisted
Cell Sorting (FACS)
Studies
The amount of β-galactosidase protein expressed
in cells is a measure of the transfection efficacy of the gene delivery
carriers. However, the number of cells transfected by the transfection
reagent is also important. The percentage of cells transfected during
the transfection efficacy experiments by the formulations showing
promising results was evaluated using FACS studies in a 24-well format.42 Fluorescence of the GFP expressed by the transfected
GFP gene was observed and captured under the fluorescence microscope
(Figures 33S and 34S (Supporting Information)). Figures 8 and 9 show the percentage of cells transfected with GFP using these
formulations in comparison to that of the naked GPF as a negative
control and the two standards as positive controls in A545 and HeLa
cells. It was observed that formulations containing cholesterol showed
a higher number of transfected cells in comparison with the formulations
without cholesterol.

A549 cells without
FBS.

Figure 9 FACS studies of optimized formulations of 5b and 5d without cholesterol and with cholesterol
[5b(chol) and 5d(chol)] using GFP expression
in HeLa cells without
FBS.

The optimized formulation of 5d containing cholesterol 5d(chol) showed almost
comparable percentage (14.99%) of transfected
cells to Lipofectamine 2000 (16.8%) in the A549 cell line and 18.78%
[5d(chol)] to 19.32% (Lipofectamine 2000) in the HeLa
cell line. Cholesterol-containing formulations [5d(chol) and 5b(chol)] showed a higher percentage of transfected
cells in comparison to their respective formulations without cholesterol
(5d and 5b).

All of the data presented
above indicates the mean ± standard
deviation from three independent measurements and was analyzed using
descriptive statistics and single-factor analysis of variance.

3.5 Intracellular Trafficking Study Using Confocal
Microscopy
Confocal microscopy was performed to track the
intracellular trafficking of the lipoplex [obtained on treatment of
the reporter plasmid with the best GA formulation containing cholesterol 5d(chol) showing the best results in the in vitro transfection
and FACS studies].45 The lipoplex was tagged
with the green fluorescent dye (YOYO 1) by incubating with it overnight.
The cells (A549 and HeLa) were treated with the tagged lipoplex in
a 6-well format. The cells were harvested at 10, 20, and 30 min. The
first column of Figure 10 shows the control group of cells without any lipoplex treatment.
The second-, third-, and fourth-column images show blue nuclei of
the cells, green fluorescent dye-tagged plasmid in the cells, and
merged images after 10, 20, and 30 min of treatment, respectively.
The images clearly reveal the journey of pDNA to nucleus inside the
HeLa cells at different time intervals after treatment of the cells
with the labeled lipoplex (Figures 10 and 35S (Supporting Information)).

min of lipoplex treatment of the cells. The bottom row images represent
phase contrast images of the cells, whereas the upper ones are merged
images showing blue-stained nucleus and the green dots surrounding
the cytoplasm and entering the nucleus, at different time intervals.

3.6 Biodistribution
and γ-Scintigraphy Studies
The lipoplex of the optimized
GA formulation containing cholesterol
[5d(chol)] showing the best results in the in vitro studies
was chosen for biodistribution studies in rats.46,47 Radiolabeling of the lipolex was performed with 99mTc
by the direct labeling procedure. The 99mTc-labeled lipoplex
of 5d(chol) formulation containing pDNA (15 μg)
was injected in the tail vein of the rats. Radioactivity in various
organs was detected quantitatively at predetermined time points (1,
6, and 24 h), and the presence of radioactivity per gram of the tissue
was plotted as given in Figure 11. At an initial point (1 h), maximum of the lipoplex
accumulated in vital organs like liver, spleen, lungs, kidneys, etc.,
and with the passage of time (6 h), accumulation of the lipoplex increased
in vital organs. After 24 h, spleen was found to contain the maximum
concentration of lipoplex followed by liver.

γ-Scintigraphic study was
performed on rabbit for qualitative
assessment of the optimized 99mTc-labeled lipoplex (5d(chol) formulation).46−48 The scintigraphic images have
been shown in Figure 12 after 1 h of administration. The images show the accumulation of 99mTc-labeled lipoplex in liver, spleen, lungs, and kidneys.

4 Conclusions
Two series of gemini amphiphiles differing in the size of the chain
length of the linker, polarity of the head groups, and number of hydrocarbons
in the hydrophobic moieties were synthesized as carriers for gene
delivery. The synthesized GAs were formulated all alone and in combination
with helper lipids like DCC, DOTAP, and cholesterol. The GA formulations
were used as carriers of the reporter gene to obtain lipoplexes with
different N/P ratios, and their transfection efficacies were assessed
in two cell lines, A549 and HeLa, in the absence of serum. The best
N/P ratios for various GA formulations without cholesterol and with
cholesterol as the helper lipid were also assessed in these two cell
lines in the presence of bovine serum albumin (BSA). The DNA stability
against DNase-I in the lipoplexes was also assessed. Compaction of
the reporter gene was found out using CD spectrometry. The best N/P
ratios of the GA formulations were also evaluated for their cytoprotective/toxic
effects using the MTT assay in both of these cell lines wherein almost
all of the GAs showed comparable cytoprotective effect to the commercially
available DNA carriers like DCC/DOPE and DOTAP/DOPE. FACS studies
for the two best formulations [5b(chol) and 5d(chol)] containing DOPE and cholesterol as helper lipids of the GAs exhibited
almost equal transfection efficacies to Lipofectamine 2000 in the
presence of BSA. Confocal microscopy showed intracellular trafficking
of the reporter gene to the nucleus within 30 min of exposure of the
cells to the lipoplexes made from the best GA formulation [5d(chol)] containing DOPE and cholesterol as the helper lipids. The two best
lipoplex formulations [5d(chol)] of the GA were labeled
with 99mTc and used for studying biodistribution in rat
and γ-scintigraphy in rabbit animal models. The labeled lipoplexes
remained localized in vital tissues like liver and spleen for 24 h.
The GA formulation [5d(chol)] containing DOPE and cholesterol
as the helper lipids offered the best results in the overall study.
GA (5d) has shown the potential to be developed as a
synthetic carrier for the delivery of therapeutic genes.
