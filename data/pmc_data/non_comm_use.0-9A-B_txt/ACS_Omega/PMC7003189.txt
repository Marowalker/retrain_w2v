A novel composite film of hydroquinone/resorcinol-based
poly(arylene
ether nitrile) (HQ/RS-PEN) improved by bisphenol A based poly(arylene
ether nitrile) (BPA-PEN) was prepared, in which BPA-PEN acts as a
plasticizer, leading to improved fluidity of the material, thereby
favoring the crystallinity of HQ/RS-PEN. Differential scanning calorimetry
(DSC), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and mechanical and rheological
tests have shown that the composites exhibited outstanding thermal
and mechanical properties as well as improved fluidity and processing
applicability compared with HQ/RS-PEN. At the same time, the crystallization
of the poly(arylene ether nitrile) blends with 5 wt % BPA-PEN could
be promoted under both static and shear flow fields. Polarizing microscope
(POM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) showed that the crystalline
morphology of HQ/RS-PEN was converted from spherulites to fibrous
crystals under shearing. DSC, X-ray diffraction (XRD), and dynamic
storage modulus results proved that the crystallization rate and crystallinity
of HQ/RS-PEN increased significantly under the shear field. The crystallinity
enhanced to a maximum of 20.1% and the melting enthalpy increased
to 33.4 J/g at 310 °C under the frequency of 0.01–100
Hz for 20 min.

1 Introduction
Plasticizer, as a kind
of polymer material additive, is of great
importance in the molding process of polymer materials. For the thermoplastic
polymer, especially polar molecules, there is an interaction between
the linear macromolecules, which are derived from van der Waals forces
(electrostatic forces, induction forces, and dispersion forces) and
hydrogen bonds.1 Although the interaction
between the molecules gives the polymer good mechanical strength,
it also affects the molding processability of the materials. The essence
of thermoplastic resin processing is to increase the mobility of polymer
by heating and weaken the interaction between them. However, for some
polymers with strong polarities and high intermolecular forces, there
is great difficulty in their forming process. Adding plasticizer can
increase the softness, elongation, and plasticity of plastics, leading
to a reduction in flow temperature and hardness of plastics, and facilitate
the molding of plastic products.2−5 Therefore, adding a plasticizer to plastic products
is an effective way to improve the molding processability of materials.

Poly(arylene ether nitrile) (PEN) has aroused tremendous attention
owing to its superb chemical and physical properties, such as good
mechanical performance, excellent radiation resistance, and high thermal
stability, which make it possible to apply in communication, military,
and aerospace fields.6−11 PENs could be divided into semicrystalline PEN and amorphous PEN
according to their condensed structure.10,11 Semicrystalline
PEN possesses better solvent corrosion resistance and thermal and
mechanical properties than amorphous PEN.12 However, semicrystalline PEN has a weaker crystallization ability.
Researchers have tried various methods to increase the crystallinity
of PEN.13,14 You et al. studied the effect of hot stretching
on the crystallinity of the PEN based on biphenol and drew a conclusion
that the crystallinity of PEN/PANI-f-BT-b calculated from wide-angle
X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectrogram using Jade 6 software increased
to 16.4% with the stretching ratios increased to 100%.13 Tong et al. reported that the crystallinity
of PEN could be improved by hot-pressing.14

For crystalline polymers, the increase of crystallinity will
increase
the tensile strength of the material as well as their softening temperature
and heat distortion temperature. In the extrusion or injection molding
process, polymer crystallization is significantly affected by the
shear field and the tensile flow field.15−18 Polymer crystallization has thus
been intensively investigated, and the research proved that the existence
of a flow field will accelerate the crystallization of polymer melt
significantly and determine the final phase morphology and mechanical
properties of polymer materials.19,20 The change
of crystallization behavior of polymers induced by the presence of
flow field is called flow-induced crystallization (FIC).21−23 As a typical nonequilibrium phase transition, FIC has become a fundamental
and significant research concern in polymer science and engineering.24,25 Up to now, a large number of experimental and theoretical studies
in FIC have been conducted on polyolefin.26,27 However, FIC studies in semicrystalline engineering thermoplastics
such as PEN are still lacking.

In this work, a low-molecular-weight
poly(arylene ether nitrile)
(PEN) based on bisphenol A structure (BPA-PEN) was added in PEN based
on the biphenol/hydroquinone (HQ/RS-PEN) structure to improve the
molding processability of the material. In this system, low-molecular-weight
polymers can act as “plasticizers” in HQ/RS-PEN with
a higher molecular weight, leading to increase the fluidity of the
materials. Meanwhile, increased fluidity of polymer can improve its
crystallinity.28 Therefore, the presence
of BPA-PEN could improve not only the molding processability but also
the crystallinity of HQ/RS-PEN. Then, the effect of different contents
of added BPA-PEN on the crystallization and thermal and mechanical
properties of the composite films was studied. Moreover, the effects
of crystallization temperature (290, 300, 310, 320, and 330 °C)
and shear frequency (1, 10, 50, and 100 Hz) on the crystallization
behavior of PEN blends are also investigated in detail.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Structural Characterization
of HQ/RS-PEN and
BPA-PEN
The chemical structures of HQ/RS-PEN and BPA-PEN
were characterized by Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR). As shown
in Figure 1, the absorption
peaks at 1601, 1508, and 1462 cm–1 belong to absorption
bands of benzene rings. Besides, the characteristic band located at
1243 cm–1 is attributed to Ar–O–Ar.29 The absorption peak located at 2231 cm–1 is assigned to the −CN symmetrical stretch vibration.30 These peaks can be discovered in both samples,
indicating the fabrication of the PENs. In addition, compared with
those of HQ/RS-PEN, the characteristic absorption bands of BPA-PEN
at 2923 and 2852 cm–1 are attributed to the nonsymmetrical
and symmetric stretching vibrations of −CH3.31 These results mentioned above indicate that
HQ/RS-PEN and BPA-PEN were synthesized successfully.

and HQ/RS-PEN polymers.

2.2 Thermal,
Mechanical, and Rheological Properties
of Poly(arylene ether nitrile) Composites
Figure 2 displays the thermal properties
of composites with different BPA-PEN mass fractions, the detail data
are also summarized in Table 1. It is found that PEN blends show only one glass transition
temperature (Tg) with the BPA-PEN contents
changing from 0 to 9 wt %, indicating the good compatibility of BPA-PEN
in the HQ/RS-PEN matrix. At the same time, Tg of the composites decreases from 170.3 to 159.4 °C.
This would be the result of the strong molecular mobility of BPA-PEN,
which improves the movement of polymer molecular chains effectively.
In addition, the melting enthalpy (ΔH) exhibits
a maximum value with 5 wt % BPA-PEN (17.2 J/g) and then decreases
with the further addition of BPA-PEN. When a small amount of BPA-PEN
is added, the low-molecular-weight BPA-PEN improves the activity and
rearrangement of HQ/RS-PEN. However, further addition of BPA-PEN decreases
the content of HQ/RS-PEN and hinders the orderly arrangement of HQ/RS-PEN
molecules, resulting in decreased ΔH.

analysis (TGA) curves.

The thermal stability
is an indispensable factor to evaluate the
performance of composite films. The thermal decomposition temperature
of 5% weight loss (Td) was evaluated from
their TGA curves (Figure 2b and Table 1). As shown in Table 1, Td decreases slightly with the BPA-PEN
content rising from 0 to 9 wt %. Nevertheless, the Td of the polymer blends is still higher than 480 °C,
indicating excellent thermal stability of the PEN composites.

Furthermore, the mechanical properties of the PEN blends were also
investigated and are shown in Figure 3a. It can be seen that both the tensile strength (TS) and tensile modulus (TM) exhibit the same tendency, i.e., they increase greatly with
the addition of a small amount of BPA-PEN and then deteriorate as
BPA-PEN increases continuously. The TS and TM of the PEN blend with 5 wt %
BPA-PEN increase to 112.3 and 3177.7 MPa, respectively, which can
be attributed to the enhanced crystallization of the PEN blends. Because
the BPA-PEN with low molecular weight shows poorer mechanical properties,
the mechanical properties of the composites decrease when the BPA-PEN
adding contents further increase. In addition, it can be seen from Figure 3b that the elongation
at the breaking of PEN blends increases from 3.6 to 8.1% with increasing
of BPA-PEN, indicating that the plasticity of the system is enhanced.
These results mentioned above suggest that BPA-PEN can enhance the
mechanical property of HQ/RS-PEN to some extent.

Figure 3 Mechanical properties
of PEN blends: (a) tensile strength and tensile
modulus and (b) elongation at break.

Figure 4 shows the
dependence of frequency on the complex viscosity of PEN blends at
340 °C. It is observed clearly that the complex viscosity of
PEN blends decreases as the frequency increases from 0.04 to 100 Hz,
indicating that the PEN blends are non-Newtonian fluids.32 At the same frequency, the complex viscosity
of the PEN blends decreases as the content of BPA-PEN addition increases.
Combined with the increase of elongation at break, the decrease of Tg and dynamic complex viscosity of the composites
with increasing BPA-PEN content from 0 to 9 wt % indicates that the
addition of BPA-PEN can enhance the fluidity of HQ/RS-PEN and ameliorate
the processability of HQ/RS-PEN.

with different BPA-PEN
contents under the frequency of 0.01–100 Hz at 340 °C.

Figure 5 shows the
Cole–Cole model curves of the PEN composites, which is intended
to study the compatibility between BPA-PEN and HQ/RS-PEN. It is well
known that the effect of fillers on the relaxation behavior of polymers
could be obtained by the viscoelastic behavior of polymer multicomponent
composites. It can be discovered that the shape of all the Cole–Cole
curves is close to a semicircle (Figure 6a–e), indicating that the introduction
of BPA-PEN did not change the relaxation mechanism of HQ/RS-PEN, and
there is good compatibility between BPA-PEN and HQ/RS-PEN. In addition,
the height of the Cole–Cole curve also reflects the viscosity
and molecular weight of the polymer matrix. The height of the Cole–Cole
curve of PEN composites is significantly lower than that of pure HQ/RS-PEN.
It indicates that the viscosity of PEN composites melt reduces after
the introduction of BPA-PEN, which is also consistent with the conclusion
of Figure 4.

BPA-PEN contents: (a) 0 wt %; (b) 3 wt %; (c) 5 wt %; (d) 7 wt %;
and (e) 9 wt %.

Relative crystallinity
of PEN blends cooling from 340 °C under a cooling rate of −5
°C/min at 10 Hz shearing.

The processing of crystalline polymer is a nonisothermal crystallization
process.33 The influence of BPA-PEN contents
on the crystallization of PEN blends was investigated by cooling down
from 340 °C under a cooling rate of −5 °C/min at
10 Hz shearing. As can be seen from Figure 6a, the dynamic storage modulus of the blends
exhibits a tendency to increase first and then decrease with decreasing
temperature. The increase of dynamic storage modulus is related to
enhanced crystallinity.33,34 Moreover, the storage
modulus of PEN composites reaches a maximum at a higher crystallization
temperature with the introduction of BPA-PEN (BPA-PEN ≤ 5 wt
%). Notably, the dynamic storage modulus possesses the most obvious
response at the content of BPA-PEN of 5 wt % under decreasing temperature
and reaches a maximum of 1940 MPa at 275 °C. More stable crystal
nucleus of PEN is formed at a higher temperature due to the fact that
the BPA-PEN with a strong locomotor activity can promote the orderly
arrangement of HQ/RS-PEN segments under shearing, thus causing the
crystallization induction period of PEN composites to shorten and
the storage modulus to increase more evidently. At the same time,
the dynamic storage modulus curve can be converted into the curve
of relative crystallinity described as follows by eq 1(35) 1  where G′0, G′t, and G′max represent
the storage modulus at
the beginning of crystallization, in the middle of crystallization,
and at the end of crystallization, respectively. The relationship
curve between temperature and relative crystallinity of PEN blends
is shown in Figure 6b. All of these curves exhibit an “L-like” shape, demonstrating
that the crystallization rate is slow in the early stage, while rapid
in the middle stage. Similar to the dynamic storage modulus, the blend
with 5 wt % BPA-PEN crystallizes first (at the highest temperature).
This indicates that PEN blends with a low content of BPA-PEN is beneficial
for crystallization under the shear field, especially when the BPA-PEN
content is 5 wt %.

2.3 Effect of Shearing on Crystal
Morphology
As shown in Figure 7a, the PEN blend with 5 wt % BPA-PEN before shearing
exhibits a cross-extinction
phenomenon under a polarizing microscope (POM). Meanwhile, the fracture
morphology of the PEN blend before shearing exhibits a typical spherulite
with a grain size of about 0.15–0.25 μm (Figure 7c). Figure 7b,d shows the POM and scanning electron microscopy
(SEM) images of the PEN blend with 5 wt % BPA-PEN after shearing for
30 min at 10 Hz. It is obvious from the figures that the PEN crystals
are oriented after shearing. The crystalline morphology changes from
spherulite to fibrous crystal. The oriented structure of PEN crystals
can greatly enhance the mechanical performance of PEN,36 which can also improve the heat resistance of
the PEN.

micrographs of the PEN blend with 5 wt % BPA-PEN before shearing (c)
and after shearing at 310 °C for 30 min at 10 Hz (d).

2.4 Effect of Shearing Temperature on Isothermal
Crystallization
As mentioned above, the addition of BPA-PEN
is beneficial for enhancing the fluidity and processing applicability
of HQ/RS-PEN. In addition, 5 wt % BPA-PEN can effectively promote
the shear-induced crystallization of HQ/RS-PEN. Therefore, the effect
of shear temperature on the crystallization behavior of the PEN blend
with 5 wt % BPA-PEN was further investigated. Figure 8 shows the storage modulus of the PEN blend
with 5 wt % BPA-PEN sheared at 290, 300, 310, 320, and 330 °C
under 0.01–100 Hz for 20 min. It can be discovered that the
dynamic storage modulus increases first with the shear temperature
increasing to 310 °C. Then, it decreases gradually with further
increases in shear temperature, indicating that the crystallization
rate is the fastest at 310 °C.

Figure 8 Dynamic storage modulus of the PEN blend
with 5 wt % of BPA-PEN
sheared at different temperatures under 0.01–100 Hz for 20
min.

The DSC curves of the PEN blend
with 5 wt % BPA-PEN at different
shear temperatures are shown in Figure 9a. It is observed that the Tg of PEN composite increases gradually with increasing shear temperature,
which can be attributed to the two aspects. On one hand, the formation
of the orientated polymer segment under the shearing field and the
more regular arrangement of the molecular segment lead to the increase
of Tg. On the other hand, PEN goes cross-linking
reaction, resulting in the formation of a three-dimensional net structure.
When shear temperatures are 290 and 300 °C, the PEN blends exhibit
two phase transition temperatures, which are a lower melting point
(Tml) and a higher melting point (Tmh). In addition, the Tml moves to the high temperature continuously as the shear
temperature increases while the Tmh remains
almost unchanged (Table 2). These results could be ascribed to the typical double melting
phenomenon.37 The double melting behavior
is formed by four processes: melting of most of the original crystals,
their recrystallization, remelting of the recrystallized portion,
and melting of the remaining crystal regions.37 Moreover, the total melting enthalpy (ΔH)
reaches its maximum value (33.4 J/g) at the shear temperature of 310
°C with the increase of shear temperature and then decreases
with the further increase of shear temperature (Table 2), same as that of dynamic storage modulus.
The crystallinity of the PEN blend with 5 wt % BPA-PEN sheared at
different temperatures under the frequency of 0.01–100 Hz for
20 min was investigated by wide-angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD) patterns,
which is shown in Figure 9b. The significant diffraction peaks around at 2θ =
17.2, 25.3, and 27.0° are observed in the curves of all the samples,
respectively.38 The crystallinity of the
PEN blend sheared at different temperatures are calculated and listed
in Table 2. The crystallinity
is up to 20.1% when sheared at 310 °C, which is also in accordance
with the results of the DSC curves.

2.5 Effect
of Shearing Frequency on Isothermal
Crystallization
An investigation of the effect of shear temperature
on crystallization showed that the PEN blend with 5 wt % BPA-PEN has
the fastest crystallization rate and the highest crystallinity when
the shear temperature is 310 °C. In this section, the effect
of shear frequency (1, 10, 50, and 100 Hz) on its crystallization
is further investigated by shearing at 310 °C for 30 min. As
shown in Figure 10a, two melting peaks appear in all DSC curves. According to the previous
result, wide melting is a result of the Tmh coming from the spherulites when sheared at 310 °C. While another
peak (around 336 °C, Tma) would have
resulted from the highly oriented fibrous crystals transformed from
these spherulites under shearing, which is also consistent with the
results of SEM and POM images. In addition, Tmh and Tma are almost the same
even when sheared under different frequencies for 30 min. The detailed
physical parameter values of the samples are summarized in Table 3. Figure 10b shows the XRD patterns of
the PEN blend with 5 wt % BPA-PEN after shearing at 310 °C under
different frequencies for 30 min. Three diffraction peaks at 2θ
= 17.2, 25.3, and 27.0°, respectively, are observed in the curves
of all samples.38 According to Figure 10b, the intensities
of diffraction peaks at 2θ = 17.2, 25.3, and 27.0° is sharpest
when the shear frequency is 10 Hz. Furthermore, the crystallinity
of PEN blends at different shear frequencies is calculated and listed
in Table 3. The highest
crystallinity is 18.8% when the shear frequency is 10 Hz, which is
identical to the DSC result.

2.6 Effect of Shearing Time
on Isothermal Crystallization
Moreover, the effect of shear
time on the crystallization behavior
of the PEN composite with 5 wt % BPA-PEN at 310 °C under 10 Hz
was investigated. It can be found from the DSC curve (Figure 11a) that as the shearing time
increases, the ΔHmh of the PEN composite
continuously decreases; however, ΔHma of the composite constantly increases. It indicates that the crystals
of the PEN composite formed are mainly spherulites in the initial
stages of crystallization, but the spherulites gradually transform
into fibrous crystals with an increase in the shearing time. The fibrous
crystals are most uniform and the total ΔH of
PEN composite reaches a maximum value of 26.5 J/g when shearing 30
min. Similarly, it can be seen from WAXD patterns (Figure 11b) that three crystal diffraction
peaks at 2θ = 17.2, 25.3, and 27.0° appear in the curves
of all samples, respectively. The crystallinity of the PEN blend sheared
at different times is calculated by Jade software and listed in Table 4. The crystallinity
is up to 18.8% when sheared for 30 min. However, as the shear time
extends to 60 min, the total ΔH and the crystallinity
of the PEN composite are reduced to 20.6 J/g and 14.4%, respectively.
This results from the fact that the unstable crystals are melted with
increasing shearing time.

PEN blend with 5 wt

3 Conclusions
In summary,
this study found that the fluidity and crystallization
ability of HQ/RS-PEN were improved by the addition of BPA-PEN, and
the obtained PEN blend films exhibit better thermal and mechanical
properties than the HQ/RS-PEN matrix. At the same time, the crystallization
of the PEN blend films with 5 wt % BPA-PEN was promoted under both
static and shear fields. POM and SEM results indicated that the crystal
form of HQ/RS-PEN was converted from a spherulite to an extended fibrous
crystal in the shear field. The DSC, XRD, and storage modulus data
showed that the crystallization of HQ/RS-PEN was accelerated and the
crystallinity of the composites increased under the shear field. When
the shear temperature was 310 °C under the frequency of 0.01–100
Hz for 20 min, the crystallization rate of the composites was the
fastest, the crystallinity of the composites reached a maximum of
20.1%, and the melting enthalpy reached a maximum of 33.4 J/g. Experiments
proved that the crystallization of HQ/RS-PEN can be improved effectively
by BPA-PEN in the shear field.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials
N-Methyl-2-pyrrolidone
(NMP) was obtained from Tianjin Bodi Chemicals Co. Ltd. (Tianjin,
China). 2,6-Dichlorobenzonitrile (DCBN), bisphenol A (BPA), resorcinol
(RS), hydroquinone (HQ), potassium carbonate (K2CO3), and toluene were purchased from Chengdu Kelong Chemicals
(Sichuan, China). All of the reagents were commercially available
and used as received.

4.2 Synthesis of PENs
HQ/RS-PEN (hydroquinone/resorcinol
= 8:2) as a typical semicrystalline PEN and BPA-PEN were synthesized
by nucleophilic aromatic substitution polymerization according to
the previous work,11 and the structure
of PEN is shown in Figure 12. The measured inherent viscosities12 of the HQ/RS-PEN and BPA-PEN polymers were 0.74 and 0.17 dL/g in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) at 75 ± 0.1 °C, respectively.

route for HQ/RS-PEN and BPA-PEN polymers.

4.3 Preparation of PEN Composite Films
A series
of PEN composite films were prepared by introducing semicrystalline
HQ/RS-PEN as a matrix and adding different mass fractions of BPA-PEN
(1, 3, 5, 7, and 9 wt %). The detailed steps are as follows. First,
the mixture was dissolved in NMP solvent at 120 °C with mechanical
agitation. Then, the mixture solution was cast on a clean horizontal
glass plate in an oven at 80, 100, and 120 °C each for 1 h, and
160 and 200 °C each for 2 h to evaporate the solvent slowly and
prevent the generation of air bubbles or pinholes on the surface of
the film. Finally, the obtained films were cooled from 200 °C
to room temperature with a rate of 10 °C/min slowly.

4.4 Shear-Induced Crystallization of PEN Composites
The
shear-induced crystallization tests of PEN blends were executed
on the advanced rotary rheometer with the sample diameter of 25 mm.
During the isothermal crystallization, the effect of shear temperature
and shear frequency on crystallization was investigated. When investigating
the effect of shear temperature on crystallization behavior, the prepared
films were heated rapidly to 340 °C for melting and maintained
at 340 °C for 10 min to eliminate the thermal history. The samples
were cooled down to the predetermined temperature (290, 300, 310,
320, and 330 °C, respectively) afterward. Finally, the shearing
experiments were performed at the corresponding temperature and at
the dynamic scanning frequency from 0.01 to 100 Hz for 20 min. While
exploring the effect of shear frequency on crystallization, the samples
were cooled down to 310 °C after eliminating the thermal history.
Different shear frequencies (1, 10, 50, and 100 Hz) were applied to
the polymer melts by plate clamps and the shear time was 30 min.

4.5 Characterization
The structures of
HQ/RS-PEN and BPA-PEN were characterized by Fourier transform infrared
(FT-IR) (8400S, Shimadzu). The thermal behavior of polymers was analyzed
by TA Instrument DSC-Q100 (DSC) and TA Instruments TGA-Q50 (TGA) under
a nitrogen atmosphere. Mechanical properties of polymers were investigated
on a series desktop electromechanical universal testing machine (SANS
CMT6104, Beijing, China). The reported values of each sample were
calculated as an average of five specimens. Powder X-ray diffraction
(XRD) (RINT2400, Rigaku) was used to investigate the crystal structure
and crystallinity of composites. The crystal morphologies of the samples
were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (JSM, 6490LV)
at 20 kV and POM observations (MP41, China). The samples for SEM testing
were prepared as follows: first, the samples were ruptured in liquid
nitrogen; then, the two samples were etched in NMP for 20 min; lastly,
the samples were sputtered with gold on the fractured surface.
