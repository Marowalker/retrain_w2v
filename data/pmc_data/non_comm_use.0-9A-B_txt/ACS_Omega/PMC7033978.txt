Herein, a simplistic redox polymerization
strategy was utilized
for the fabrication of a poly(methacrylic acid)/montmorillonite hydrogel
nanocomposite (PMA/nMMT) and probed as a sorbent for sequestration
of two pharmaceutical contaminants, viz., amoxicillin (AMX) and diclofenac
(DF), from wastewater. The synthesized hydrogel nanocomposite was
characterized by the Fourier transform infrared, X-ray diffraction,
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy–energy
dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, and transmission electron microscopy
techniques to analyze structural characteristics and sorption interactions.
The efficacy of PMA/nMMT was thoroughly investigated for the sequestration
of AMX and DF from the aquatic phase with a variation in operative
variables like agitation time, sorbent dosage, pH, and initial sorbate
concentration. The reaction kinetics was essentially consistent with
the pseudo-second-order model with rate dominated by the intraparticle
diffusion model as well as the film diffusion mechanism. The Freundlich
isotherm appropriated the equilibrium data over the entire range of
concentration. Thermodynamic investigation explored the spontaneous
and endothermic nature of the process. The most possible mechanism
has been explained, which includes electrostatic interaction, hydrogen
bonding, cationic exchange, and partition mechanism. Economic feasibility,
better sorption capacity (152.65 for AMX and 152.86 mg/g for DF),
and efficient regeneration and reusability even after four consecutive
sorption–desorption cycles ascertained PMA/nMMT as a potential
sorbent for AMX and DF uptake from the aqueous phase.

==== Body
Introduction
Aqueous effluents emanating
from pharmaceutical industries, hospitals,
municipal areas, and body discharges1 are
generally contaminated with numerous hazardous organic pollutants,
which are rarely biodegradable even at a low concentration range.2 The
release of emerging contaminants into the ecosystem has obnoxious
effects on ecological species and poses a substantial threat to the
human and aquatic health.3 Among the pollutants
derived from pharmaceutical industries, amoxicillin (AMX) and diclofenac
(DF) were selected as probe molecules because they are extensively
used and ubiquitously found in aqueous bodies.4 Amoxicillin belongs to the group of β-lactam antibiotics with
characteristic properties of treating bacterial infection, pneumonia,
strep throat, and urinary tract and skin infection.5 Diclofenac being an anti-inflammatory and nonsteroidal
drug is broadly used to appease inflammation, pain caused by migraine,
arthritis, gout, and some other illnesses.6 However, they are not entirely metabolized upon consumption and
approximately 10–15% of these compounds are excreted and subsequently
discharged into the environment due to incompetent sewage system.7 It is reported8 that
both amoxicillin and diclofenac cause chronic effects like gastrointestinal
and renal tissue damage in many vertebrates, reduction in size, and
hatchability among various fish species. Human health can be adversely
affected by the consumption of contaminated potable water.9 Thus, to safeguard the environment from toxicities
related to pharmaceutical pollutants, there is a critical requirement
of their removal from aqueous sources.

Several remediation strategies
have been probed for the uptake
of the pharmaceutical-laden wastewater, including solid-phase separation,10 flocculation, coagulation,11 ultrasonic degradation,12 photodegradation,13 electrochemical degradation,14 and advanced oxidation processes.15 These technologies suffer from various flaws as they are technically
sophisticated or economically unfavorable. Moreover, they generate
toxic effluents and have a limited removal efficacy.16

Adsorption offers a prominent method for treating
effluents due
to its simplicity, economic feasibility, nonproduction of secondary
products and free radicals, and high surface area, as well as the
presence of functional groups with developed pore assembly.17 Carbon-based sorbents such as activated carbon
derived from olive stones,18 vine wood,19 guava seeds,20Moringa oleifera,21 pine
tree,22 and Mn-impregnated activated carbon23 have been ubiquitously used for the uptake of
amoxicillin and diclofenac from wastewater. However, due to their
high cost24 and difficulty in separation
from aqueous solution, the development of highly effective sorbents
is considerably important.

Clay-based hydrogel nanocomposites
are envisioned to be potential
super adsorbents for the uptake of inorganic and/or organic contaminants
from an aqueous solution due to the combining characteristics of both
clays and polymers, such as biodegradability, biocompatibility, economic
viability, abundance, high specific surface area, three-dimensional
network, and swelling–deswelling properties.25 Recently, many clay-based hydrogel composites have been
explored for the confiscation of dyes26,27 and metals28−31 mainly because of their chemically reactive functional groups and
porous structures. A perusal of the literature reveals that there
is little work on the removal of pharmaceutical pollutants by clay–hydrogel
nanocomposites; therefore, the main motive was to explore the efficacy
of poly(methacrylic acid)/montmorillonite hydrogel (PMA/nMMT) nanocomposite
toward the uptake of amoxicillin and diclofenac from wastewater. The
nanoscale MMT (nMMT) expectedly with improved cation–exchange
capacity, hydrophilicity, adsorption capacity, interactive surface
functional groups, and increased surface-to-volume ratio was used
as a filler, which could elevate the mechanical strength, increase
active sites for maximum sorption, high surface area, and improved
regenerative ability of PMA/nMMT nanocomposite. The increase in the
adsorption capacity and reusability is crucial from the practical
viewpoint. Further, to comprehend the adsorption mechanism, the impact
of operative variables such as dose, agitation time, pH, and initial
sorbate concentration was explored. Equilibrium data were analyzed
using various kinetic and isotherm models and thermodynamic parameters
to gain significant insight into the process. The regeneration potential
was investigated to probe the sustainability of the synthesized sorbent.

Experimental

Chemicals and Instruments
Methacrylic acid, montmorillonite
(MMT), amoxicillin trihydrate (AMX, 99%), diclofenac sodium (DF, 99%),
cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB), N,N,N,N-tetramethylethylenediamine
(TEMED), sodium nitrite, 2,2′-bipyridine, ferric chloride,
ammonium persulfate (APS), and sodium carbonate were obtained from
Merck, India. Sulfanilic acid was procured from CDH and HCl from Fischer
Scientific, India. All chemicals/reagents were of A.R grade and used
as received. The chemical structures of AMX and DF with their corresponding
Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra are depicted in Figure 1.

Figure 1 Chemical structures and
the corresponding FTIR spectra of AMX and
DF.

FTIR spectra of montmorillonite
(MMT), nanomontmorillonite (nMMT),
poly(methacrylic acid)/montmorillonite hydrogel nanocomposite (PMA/nMMT),
and AMX- or DF-loaded nanocomposite were obtained on a PerkinElmer
BX FTIR spectrophotometer. X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern was obtained
on a D8 Advance diffractometer (Bruker) with Cu target (λ =
0.154 nm) at 40 kV. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was done
on ESCA+ (Omicron Nanotechnology Oxford Instruments, Germany, Al Kα
radiation hν = 1486.7 eV). Scanning electron
microscopy (SEM) micrographs were obtained on a Phenom ProX (Nanoscience
Instruments, Phoenix, AZ) equipped with an energy-disperse X-ray (EDX)
instrument under an extra high tension of 15 kV at a working distance
of 3.8 mm with an aperture width of 30 μm. Transmission electron
microscopy (TEM) images were recorded on a transmission electron microscope
(HRTEM 200 kV model, FEI Tecnai). The residual concentrations of AMX
and DF at 455 and 520 nm (λmax), respectively, were
analyzed by a UV–vis spectrophotometer (T80+, PG Instruments
Ltd, U.K.).

Preparation of Nanomontmorillonite Clay (nMMT)
Nanomontmorillonite
(nMMT) was framed following the procedure illustrated by Khan et al.31 Briefly, 50 g of MMT was washed three to four
times with double-distilled water, left as such overnight and finely
grated. This clay (12 g) was dispersed in 100 mL of double-distilled
water in a 500 mL beaker containing dil. HCl (4 mL). The mixture was
heated at 70 °C on a heating mantle for 30 min and finally dispersed
in 50 mL of CTAB (0.5 M) with stirring for 12 h at 70 °C by a
magnetic stirrer. The clay was filtered off and dried for 48 h at
80 °C in an oven. Finally, it was ground to nanomontmorillonite
(nMMT) powder, which was stored in glass bottles.

Preparation
of Poly(methacrylic acid)/Montmorillonite (PMA/nMMT)
Hydrogel Nanocomposite
A PMA/nMMT hydrogel nanocomposite
was prepared via ultrasound-assisted redox polymerization. Typically,
1.0 g of nMMT was dispersed in 50 mL of distilled water with ultrasonic
vibration for 2 h to form a homogeneous dispersion. The ultrasound
helps in the improved dispersion of clay, resulting in an enhancement
of the mechanical properties and adsorption capacity of the hydrogels.
Methacrylic acid monomer (30 mL) was added dropwise to the suspension.
Initiator ammonium persulfate (APS) (0.1 M) was added to the mixture
followed by 1.0 mL of TEMED accelerator. The dispersion was vigorously
stirred for 4 h at 50 °C by a magnetic stirrer. The resulting
sticky mass was acetone-washed and desiccated for 48 h at 70 °C
in an oven. The resulting product was ground and stored in a glass
bottle. Different nanocomposites were synthesized by varying the nMMT
in quantities of 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0 g. The nanocomposite prepared
using 1.0 g of nMMT depicted better adsorption results than the rest
of composites and was therefore used for further adsorption investigation.

Adsorption Studies
Batch mode was employed to investigate
the impact of process parameters on the adsorption of AMX and DF onto
PMA/nMMT. A fixed mass of PMA/nMMT (0.2–1.8 g) was taken in
conical flasks (50 mL) containing 25 mL of a sorbate solution (40–90
mg/L) and shaken on a water bath shaker for 40 min at 303, 313, and
323 K. The impact of the initial solution pH was examined by changing
the pH from 2 to 10 by adding NaOH or HCl (0.1 M) solution. When the
equilibrium was attained, the solution was centrifuged at 1500 rpm
for 5 min, and the residual concentration of AMX or DF in supernatant
was spectrophotometrically determined. For absorbance measurement,
an equimolar (0.1 M) mixture of HCl, NaNO3, and sulfanilic
acid (1.0 mL each) was coupled with Na2CO3 (0.1
M, 1.0 mL), and an AMX solution was added to it, which developed an
orange-colored solution32 with λmax at 455 nm. The DF solution was treated with a FeCl3 solution (0.1 M, 1.0 mL) and then subsequently reacted with
2,2′-bipyridine (0.1 M, 1.0 mL) to form a red solution,33 which absorbed at 520 nm (λmax). The parameters of sorption capacity, qe, and removal efficiency (%), were assessed using eqs 1 and 2, respectively 1   2  where Ce and Ci are the equilibrium and initial sorbate concentrations
(mg/L), V represents volume (L) of sorbate solution,
and WM is the sorbent mass (g). Isotherm
studies were investigated by shaking 25 mL (40–90 mg/L) of
sorbate solution with PMA/nMMT (1.2 or 1.4 g for AMX or DF) for 40
min at 303, 313, and 323 K. The kinetic investigations were accomplished
by shaking 25 mL (60–80 mg/L) of sorbate solution with PMA/nMMT
(AMX: 1.2 g; DF: 1.4 g) for 40 min at 323 K.

Results and Discussion
Characterization
of PMA/nMMT Hydrogel Nanocomposite
The binding of pollutants
is determined by the existence of functional
groups on the surface of the adsorbent. Thus, the FTIR technique was
employed to verify the chemical functionality. The FTIR spectra of
MMT, nMMT, PMA/nMMT, and AMX- or DF-loaded PMA/nMMT are compared in Figure 2. A broad peak at
3440 cm–1 and a sharper one at 1637 cm–1 correspond to the O–H stretching and deformation vibrations,
respectively.34 The peak at 3631 cm–1 is assigned to O–H stretching vibrations of
the Si–OH and Al–OH groups of montmorillonite.35 The absorption band observed at 1031 cm–1 is attributed to in-plane stretching vibrations of
the Si–O group,36 whereas the peaks
at 528 and 455 cm–1 represent Al–O–Si
and Si–O–Si bending vibrations, respectively.37 The absorption bands in nMMT at 2922 and 2850
cm–1 represent stretching modes of the CH3 and CH2 groups of CTAB.38 Moreover,
the C–C–C flexural vibration of the methylene group
associated with the cetyltrimethylammonium ion peak is exhibited at
1480 cm–1, which confirms the successful modification
of montmorillonite. The reduction in the intensity of absorption peaks
in the PMA/nMMT spectrum at 2922 and 2850 cm–1 along
with the appearance of new sharp peaks at 1730 and 1252 cm–1 corresponding to C=O and C–O stretching vibrations
of the carboxylic group39 supports the
formation of hydrogel nanocomposite. In the spectra of PMA/nMMT-loaded
AMX and DF, the appearance of characteristic absorption bands corresponding
to the C–N stretching of the amine group (1384 cm–1) and the O–C=O stretching of the carboxylic group
(1565 cm–1) reveals the successful sorption of AMX
and DF onto PMA/nMMT. A red shift from 3440 to 3454 cm–1 indicates the participation of the −OH group in hydrogen
bonding during the sorption process. The structural vibration regions
of PMA/nMMT show no significant changes after sorption, depicting
the structural stability of PMA/nMMT after AMX and DF sorption.

of MMT, nMMT, PMA/nMMT hydrogel nanocomposite, and
AMX- and DF-loaded nanocomposite.

XRD diffractograms of MMT, nMMT, and PMA/nMMT are displayed in Figure 3. MMT having a 2:1
layered structure of smectite class is represented by a sharp peak
at 2θ = 26.80° corresponding to quartz mineral,41 while the peak at 2θ = 19.82° confirms
the presence of random stacked layers. The basal (001) space of MMT
is displayed at 2θ = 6.29°. The diffractogram of nMMT exhibits
a change in peak intensities attributed to structural modifications
in existing planes with the formation of new layers. Moreover, the
average crystallite sizes (L) of MMT and nMMT using
Scherer’s equation (L = 0.9λ/β cos θ)
were 103.3 and 55.3 nm, respectively. The diffractogram pattern of
PMA/nMMT displays an amorphous halo at 14.29°. The disappearance
of the basal peak indicates exfoliation of nMMT layers into the PMA
matrix,42 which suggests the formation
of the PMA/nMMT hydrogel nanocomposite.

Figure 3 XRD spectra of MMT, nMMT,
and PMA/nMMT hydrogel nanocomposite.

The chemical states of PMA/nMMT, before and after adsorption of
AMX and DF, were analyzed by XPS, and are depicted in Figure 4. The study illustrates the
existence of C, O, Al, Si, and Mg in the hydrogel nanocomposite. The
C 1s peak is assigned to the presence of PMA, while the peaks of Si
2p, Al 2p, and Mg 2s are attributed to MMT.43 The peak of Na 1s determines the presence of sodium on the MMT surface.
The O 1s peak is due to both PMA and MMT. The presence of N 1s peak
and an increase in carbon and oxygen intensities in the spectra of
PMA/nMMT after sorption depict the successful grafting of AMX or DF
onto the surface of PMA/nMMT.

and AMX-/DF-loaded
nanocomposite.

The SEM micrographs recorded at
a magnification of 1.00 KX along
with the EDX of MMT, nMMT, PMA/nMMT, and AMX- or DF-loaded PMA/nMMT
are illustrated in Figure 5. It is observed that raw MMT owes a layered sheet structure
showing the presence of larger grains. After modification, the sheets
of MMT are exfoliated into tiny particles, which may be due to the
elimination of Si2+ and Al3+ from the octahedral
sites. The EDX spectrum of nMMT exhibits a high percentage of carbon,
which may primarily be due to the surfactant utilized for modification
as the main constituent of CTAB (C19H42BrN)
is carbon (84%). PMA/nMMT displays a coherent and near-co-continuous
structure. Further, no pores are visible, which depicts the complete
exfoliation of nMMT into the PMA matrix. After AMX or DF sorption,
changes in the PMA/nMMT morphology are observed. The surface becomes
asymmetric with an increase in the rough texture.

and (d) AMX- and (e) DF-loaded nanocomposite.

TEM investigation was used to assess the structural insights of
nMMT and PMA/nMMT. The TEM micrographs of nMMT shown in Figure 6a exhibit nearly spherical
particles of 7–15 nm diameter. The presence of CTAB in the
interlamellar space of nMMT prevents its agglomeration to a large
extent. The TEM images of PMA/nMMT (Figure 6b) display a PMA network shown as the light
zone in which nMMT as the dark zone is uniformly dispersed.

of (a) nMMT and (b) PMA/nMMT.

Effect of Operational Parameters
To figure out the
impact of sorbent dosage on the removal efficiency, different varying
amounts (0.2–1.4 g/L) of PMA/nMMT were used. With increasing
sorbent dose, a sharp escalation in the removal efficiency for AMX
(74.3–98.6%) and DF (75.8–96.0%) is observed, which
can be credited to an overall increase in the sorbent surface regions.
However, a fall in the adsorption capacity for AMX occurs from 111.5
to 20.6 mg/g and for DF from 151.7 to 27.4 mg/g (Figure S6). This antagonistic effect could be associated with
the aggregation of sorbent at higher doses, which enlarges the diffusional
pathway for AMX and DF to reach the binding sites.44 Therefore, the optimized dose for AMX (1.2 g/L) and DF
(1.4 g/L) at which maximum removal was attained when the pollutant
concentration was 40 mg/L was taken for subsequent experiments.

Contact time is a prime factor that affects the adsorption process.
To illustrate the impact of contact time on the adsorption of AMX
and DF onto PMA/nMMT, experiments were conducted for 10–60
min with a 10 min time interval, keeping the concentration (40 mg/L)
and sorbent dose (1.2 and 1.4 g/L for AMX and DF, respectively) constant.
It can be inferred from Figure S7 that
the increase in the uptake efficiency within the initial 40 min is
rapid but exhibits a steady trend with further increase in time, which
may be attributed to the occurrence of available sorption sites on
the sorbent during the initial stage of the sorption process and the
increase in the collision frequency of AMX or DF on the surface of
PMA/nMMT. The maximum % efficacy and sorption capacity is achieved
at 40 min, which is subsequently used in further investigations. The
scavenging potential of PMA/nMMT (95.80% for AMX and 95.14% for DF)
within a time period of 40 min qualifies it as a potential sorbent.

The pH of the reaction environment is a critical aspect that governs
the protonation and deprotonation of pollutants in the aqueous phase,
which affects pollutant binding onto the sorbent surface. To determine
the effect of initial solution pH on the sorption of AMX and DF on
the PMA/nMMT surface, pH was changed from 2 to 10 (Figure 7), keeping rest of the parameters
such as contact time (40 min), dose (1.2 and 1.4 g/L for AMX and DF,
respectively), and initial concentration (40 mg/L) constant. It is
evident that AMX contains three functional groups with different pKa values—carboxyl (pKa = 2.68), amine (pKa = 7.49),
and hydroxyl (pKa = 9.63), which means
AMX is cationic at pH < 2.68, anionic at pH > 7.49, and zwitterionic
at neutral pH.45 At pH 2, cationic exchange
takes place between positively charged AMX and the sorbent as pHpzc of PMA/nMMT is 3.98.46 When
the pH is increased from 3 to 4, stronger electrostatic interactions
between negatively charged amoxicillin and positive PMA/nMMT surface
are observed, escalating the removal efficiency. As the solution pH
is increased further, AMX becomes neutral and is adsorbed onto the
surface of PMA/nMMT by the partition mechanism. Further increase in
pH increases the electrostatic repulsion, thereby decreasing the adsorption.47 The removal efficiency of DF is quite high at
acidic pH and falls off with increasing pH. At pH < pKa (4.2), the DF becomes neutral48 and the PMA/nMMT surface is positive; therefore, instead of electrostatic
attraction, the hydrogen bonding may dominate the removal mechanism.

Figure 7 Effect
of pH on (a) AMX and (b) DF removal.

The effect of the initial concentration of pollutants on the removal
efficacy of PMA/nMMT for the uptake of AMX and DF is shown in Figure 8. It reveals that
with an increase in the initial sorbate concentration from 40 to 90
mg/L, an escalation in the sorption capacity for AMX (from 32.37 to
71.66 mg/g) and DF (from 27.29 to 61.62 mg/g) may be accredited to
a large driving force provided by higher initial concentration that
reduces the mass transfer resistance, leading to an increase in the
adsorption amount.49 Also, at the initial
stage, both the pollutants adhere conveniently on the PMA/nMMT surface
due to the availability of active sites, which boosts the sorption
capacity till equilibrium is attained. At a low concentration, the
relative number of active sites and sorbate molecules is high, which
makes the sorbate molecules interact with the sorbent and results
in prompt uptake from the solution. On increasing the concentration,
the removal efficacy represents a fall attributed to the saturation
of binding sites.

Figure 8 Effect of Initial concentration for (a) AMX and (b) DF
removal.

Adsorption Isotherm Studies
Adsorption isotherm is
a fundamental tool that illuminates the interaction between sorbate
and sorbent and further describes the maximum sorption capacity. To
design the process and to figure out the best-fit model, the nonlinear
form of various isotherm models was coordinated with equilibrium data
at 303, 313, and 323 K. Besides, the applicability of isotherm models
was appraised based on correlation coefficient (R2) and standard error of estimation (SEE) that were calculated
for each model and are presented in Table 1.

The
Langmuir model presumes adsorption to occur via monolayer formation
on the homogeneous surface.50 It further
assumes that active sites are finite and no lateral interaction is
observed between the adsorbed molecules on adjacent sorption sites. Equation 3 expresses nonlinear
regression of the Langmuir model 3  where Ce (mg/L)
is the equilibrium concentration of sorbate in solution, b (L/mg) is the Langmuir binding constant, qe and Qmax (mg/g) are the amount
of sorbate adsorbed at equilibrium and the maximum sorption capacity,
respectively.

The values of Qmax, b, and R2 were investigated
from the plot
of qe vs Ce at 303–323 K (Figure S1). An increment
in b values with a rise in temperature depicts a
stronger interaction between sorbent and sorbate. The Qmax values turn out to be 152.65 mg/g for AMX and 152.86
mg/g for DF, which are significantly higher than those of reported
sorbents (Table 2).
This observation establishes the superiority of PMA/nMMT nanocomposite
over many other sorbents for AMX and DF removal. The enhancement in
maximum sorption capacity with the rise in temperature is indicative
of the endothermic nature of the process. Thus, at a higher temperature,
more energy is supplied, which augments the physical attachment of
sorbate on the binding sites of the sorbent. The values of separation
factor,  (0.053 for AMX and 0.093
for DF), illustrate
the sorption process to be favorable.

The Freundlich model elucidates the multilayer sorption
pattern
onto the heterogenous surface.60 The nonlinear
form is described by eq 4 4  where Kf (L/mg)
attributes to the Freundlich constant associated with the sorption
capacity and 1/nf is the heterogeneity
factor, which depicts whether adsorption is favorable (1/nf < 1) or unfavorable (1/nf > 1). The parameters Kf and 1/nf were assessed from the plot of qe vs Ce (Figure 9), which suggests the isotherm
to be favorable as the values of 1/nf (0.56–0.65
for AMX and 0.68–0.69 for DF) are less than unity (Table 1). The values of 1/nf may be due to the surface site distribution,
which limits the sorbate–sorbent interaction with an increase
in surface density.

Temkin isotherm speculates reduction in the heat
of adsorption
of all molecules in the layer with increased sorbent–sorbate
interaction and further specifies the uniform distribution of binding
energies. Equation 5 expresses
the nonlinear form of the Temkin isotherm model 5  where Kt (L/g) is the binding constant related
to the maximum binding
energy and bt (=RT/βt) is a constant relevant to heat of adsorption
(kJ/mol). The values of Kt and bt were calculated
from the qe vs Ce plot (Figure S2), which depicts
a significant sorbate–sorbent interaction and a minor change
in the heat of sorption with temperature change, respectively. The
obtained values of bt (Table 1) substantiate
the physisorption to dominate the sorption process.

The D–R
isotherm is a generalized model that is not restricted
to the homogeneous surface or constant adsorption potential.61 This model differentiates between physical and
chemical adsorption because of the mean energy of adsorption (E). It is reported62 that if
the value of E (kJ/mol) is between 1 and 8 kJ/mol,
then the physical interaction dominates the adsorption process and
an ion-exchange phenomenon is observed between 8 and 16 kJ/mol, and
above 16 kJ/mol, chemical interaction is the main force. Equation 6 enunciates the nonlinear
equation of the D–R model 6  where qD (mg/g)
is the D–R constant and KD (=βadR2T2) corresponds to the activity coefficient. Isotherm parameters were
determined from the plots of qe vs Ce (Figure S3). The
mean adsorption energy was calculated using . The value of adsorption
energy (E) for AMX (1.26–1.42 kJ/mol) and
DF (1.10–1.28
kJ/mol) falls in the range of physisorption (1–8 kJ/mol) supporting
the findings of the Temkin model.

To analyze the best-fit model,
statistical parameters such as correlation
coefficient (R2) and standard error of
estimation (SEE) were utilized (Table 1). Higher R2 values (0.994
for AMX and 0.996 for DF) and lower SEE values (0.135 for AMX and
0.790 for DF) verify that the Freundlich model best describes the
equilibrium data implying multilayer sorption of AMX and DF on the
heterogeneous surface of PMA/nMMT.

Kinetic Investigations
Adsorption rate is a prime factor
that determines the adsorption efficiency of an adsorbent. It illustrates
the mechanism of control of the sorption process, which may be surface
adsorption, chemical reaction, or penetration mechanism. The kinetics
of AMX and DF adsorption onto PMA/nMMT was evaluated by pseudo-first-order
and pseudo-second-order models. Nonlinear forms of the models are
expressed as (eqs 7 and 8) 7   8  where k1 (1/min)
and k2 (g/(mg min)) correspond to rate
constants of pseudo-first-order and pseudo-second-order models, respectively.
The values of qe, k1, and k2 (Table 3) of pseudo-first-order (Figure S4) and pseudo-second-order rate equations (Figure 10) were determined
from the plot of qt vs t. It is inferred that the pseudo-second-order model provides
the best representation of sorption kinetics based on higher R2 (AMX: 0.96; DF: 0.97) and lower SSE values
(AMX: 0.48–0.58; DF: 0.34–0.37), which implies that
the sorption rate of PMA/nMMT is influenced by the number of binding
sites rather than the concentration of AMX or DF in solution. Moreover,
the k parameter has a relatively higher value, which
qualifies PMA/nMMT as a rapid scavenger of AMX or DF from the aqueous
phase.

Diffusion models were
further related with equilibrium data to
elucidate the diffusion mechanism and the rate-controlling step. The
adsorption kinetics usually involves four steps: (a) mass transfer
of sorbate from bulk solution to the external surface of sorbent (film
diffusion), (b) boundary layer diffusion, (c) mass movement of sorbate
from the external layer into interior pores of the sorbent (intraparticle
diffusion), and (d) coverage of all binding sites by adsorbate.63 The boundary layer and coverage of active sites
have a meager impact, while film diffusion and intraparticle diffusion
affect the kinetics considerably.

Generally, the intraparticle
diffusion model64 based on surface and
pore diffusion is utilized to determine
the rate-controlling step. It is expressed in the mathematical form
as (eq 9) 9  where Ki (mg/(g min0.5))
implies the intraparticle rate
constant and Ci is a
constant related to the thickness of the boundary layer. The values
of Ki and Ci were determined from the slope and
intercept, respectively, of qt vs t0.5 plots, and are presented
in Table 4. It is evident
from the plots that mainly three steps are involved in AMX and DF
sorption onto PMA/nMMT. The initial portion portrays immediate sorption
on the external surface. The gradual coverage of active sites due
to intraparticle diffusion of AMX and DF is represented by the second
stage. The decrease in the intraparticle diffusion rate due to extremely
low sorbate concentration and lower availability of active sites is
described by the final step.65 As described
by eq 9, if the plot
of qt vs t0.5 is linear and passes through the origin, intraparticle
diffusion dominates the sorption kinetics. However, the plots exhibit
multilinearity and deviate from the origin (Figure 11), which implies that intraparticle diffusion
is not the sole rate-limiting step. Moreover, larger values of the
intercept for AMX (40.39–54.29) and DF (34.99–46.81)
reveal a greater boundary layer effect.66

The Boyd kinetic model67 was further
employed to appraise kinetic data, which is expressed as (eq 10) 10  where F (qt/qe) represents
the fractional equilibrium, KA (1/min)
is the liquid-film diffusion constant. The deviation of the straight-line
plots of −ln(1 – F) vs t (Figure S5) from the origin represents
that the liquid-film diffusion is not the sole controlling step,68 which illustrates both intraparticle and liquid-film
models governing the diffusive mechanism.

Thermodynamic Investigations
Comprehensive information
regarding innate energy changes associated with the adsorption process
is specified by thermodynamic parameters. The standard enthalpy change
(ΔH°), standard entropy change (ΔS°), and standard Gibbs free-energy change (ΔG°) were analyzed at 303, 313, and 323 K, and the values
are provided in Table 5. The thermodynamic parameters were determined using the van’t
Hoff plot of log(qe/Ce) vs 1/T (Figure 12) employing eq 11 and Gibbs equation (eq 12) 11   12  where R (8.314 J/(K mol))
represents the ideal gas constant and T (K) is the absolute temperature. The ΔG° values are found to be negative at all studied temperatures
for AMX (−5.22, −6.06, and −6.89) and DF (−5.70,
−6.51, and −7.32), confirming the feasibility and spontaneity
of the sorption process. The positive values of ΔS° demonstrate an increase in the disorder of AMX (0.083 kJ/mol)
and DF (0.081 kJ/mol) molecules at the sorbate–sorbent interface.
The ΔH° values for AMX (20.06 kJ/mol)
and DF (18.83 kJ/mol) specify the endothermic nature of sorption on
the surface of PMA/nMMT.

Simultaneous Removal of
AMX and DF and the Effect of NaCl on
% Sorption by the PMA/nMMT Nanocomposite
Simultaneous sequestration
of pollutants specifies the portion of binding sites occupied by each
of the pollutants on the surface of sorbent.69 It further evaluates the interaction of one sorbate on the sorbent
surface in the companionship of other sorbate molecules. To investigate
the simultaneous sorption, a binary system of AMX-DF with an initial
concentration of 40–90 mg/L and PMA/nMMT (1.5 g/L) was shaken
for 40 min on a water bath shaker. Equation 13 was utilized to calculate the ratio of %
removal efficiencies 13  where qa and qm are the removal efficiencies of AMX and DF
in the binary system and monocomponent system with the same initial
concentration, respectively. Simultaneous sorption process might fall
under three cases based on the values of R. If R > 1, a synergistic effect is observed, i.e., both the
sorbate molecules work in association that results in an escalation
in % removal. If R < 1, the antagonistic effect
is dominant, which implies the suppression of one pollutant in the
presence of other, which leads to a decrease in the removal efficacy.
If R = 1, no interaction can be seen, which means
that % removal is independent of the impact of binary mixture.70 In this work, the antagonistic effect was observed
as R values are less than unity (Figure 13a), which suggests that competitive
sorption is prevalent between both the drugs.

Figure 13 Effect of (a) simultaneous
sorption and (b) NaCl on AMX and DF
sorption.

The salinity of the solution has
a prominent impact on the adsorption
process. To illustrate the effect of Cl– on % sorption
of AMX and DF, NaCl solutions of varying concentrations (0.1, 0.5,
0.7, 1.0, 1.5 M) were used. Figure 13b demonstrates that both pharmaceutical contaminants
exhibit a monotonic decrease in % removal with the rise in salinity.
The observed trend may be due to the competitive sorption of sorbate
and the ions from the solution onto the available binding sites on
the PMA/nMMT surface. This validates the electrostatic interaction
as the main mechanism for sequestration, which is consistent with
the pH investigations.

Desorption and Reusability of Adsorbent
Long-term reusability
and ease in the recovery of the sorbent is a critical factor for its
industrial application as it has a significant impact on economic
conceivability and reduces the disposal problem of the used sorbent.
The reusability potential of PMA/nMMT was assessed by performing four
desorption–adsorption cycles. PMA/nMMT (2 g/L) was saturated
with AMX and DF (60 mg/L) for 3 h and then dried. Sorption sites were
regenerated using HCl (0.1 M). The sorbent exhibits a better regeneration
potential for AMX and DF up to four cycles (Table 6), which signifies PMA/nMMT as a potential
sorbent. The removal efficiency diminishes owing to unadsorbed pollutants
and weight loss of PMA/nMMT during the sorption–desorption
cycles.

Conclusions
This work demonstrated
the successful preparation of a poly(methacrylic
acid)/montmorillonite hydrogel nanocomposite via redox polymerization
and its subsequent usage in AMX and DF uptake from the aqueous phase.
The structural characteristics of PMA/nMMT were investigated employing
FTIR, XRD, XPS, scanning electron microscopy–energy dispersive
X-ray spectroscopy (SEM–EDS), and TEM techniques. The impact
of operative variables was evaluated, and the optimal conditions were
found to be dose (1.2 g/L for AMX and 1.4 g/L for DF), agitation time
(40 min), pH (6 for AMX and 2 for DF), and initial concentration (80
mg/L). Various isotherm models were utilized, among which the Freundlich
model appropriately suited the equilibrium data, suggesting multilayer
adsorption onto the heterogeneous surface. The maximum sorption capacity
was found to be 156.65 for AMX and 152.86 mg/g for DF, which is better
than most of the reported sorbents establishing the high performance
of PMA/nMMT hydrogel nanocomposite. The adsorption kinetics was dominated
by pseudo-second order with both intraparticle and film diffusion
controlling the rate. The synergistic effect of cationic exchange,
electrostatic interaction, partition mechanism, and hydrogen bonding
could elucidate the enhanced adsorption of AMX and DF onto PMA/nMMT.
Thermodynamic parameters revealed that AMX and DF sorption onto PMA/nMMT
was spontaneous and endothermic in nature, and the sorption capacity
increased with rising temperature. The process was accompanied by
an increase in randomness at the solid–solution interface,
which was specified by positive ΔS° values. The sorbent exhibited a better reusability potential up
to four cycles without a considerable loss in its efficiency. Simultaneous
sorption and presence of NaCl limits the removal efficiency of PMA/nMMT.
Therefore, facile fabrication, economic feasibility, and better sorption
capacity coupled with reusability authenticate PMA/nMMT as a potential
sorbent for AMX and DF removal from the aquatic environment.
