A new
acceptor unit, fluorinated thieno[2′,3′:4,5]benzo[1,2-d][1,2,3]triazole (fBTAZT), has been designed and synthesized
to build two donor–acceptor (D–A) copolymers with the
none/fluorinated benzodithiophene (BDT) unit, which have been applied
as the electron-donating material with ITIC as an electron-accepting
material to fabricate the nonfullerene polymer solar cells (PSCs).
It is found that fluorination at the BTAZT unit and BDT unit exerts
a significant influence on photophysical properties and photovoltaic
performances of the PSCs. As a result, when the fluorine atom is introduced
both into the BTAZT unit and the side-chain thiophene ring of the
BDT unit, the corresponding polymer PfBTAZT-fBDT exhibits deeper highest
occupied molecular orbital–lowest unoccupied molecular orbital
energy level and shows stronger interchain interaction with a little
broad and red-shift absorption and high charge mobilities as well
as good phase-separated morphologies, thus leading to higher power
conversion efficiency of 6.59% in nonfullerene PSCs compared with
another polymer PfBTAZT-BDT without F atom at the BDT unit, indicating
that fBTAZT can be acted as a medium strong organic acceptor to build
D–A polymer donor for high efficient PSCs.

Introduction
Polymer solar cells
(PSCs) as a new energy have got a lot of attention
because of their great merits of being lightweight, constitute flexible,
and low-cost fabrication.1−7 Much recently, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PSCs has
been boosted from over 10–11%8,9 up to over
13–14%10−16 in single junction solar cells with a medium or wide band gap-conjugated
polymer as a donor and narrow band gap n-type organic semiconductor
(n-OS) as an acceptor. At present, a series of narrow band gap n-OS
acceptors with excellent performance,17−33 such as ITIC,34 IEIC,35 and IDIC,36,37 have been reported. With the
rapid development of the narrow band gap n-OS acceptors, medium or
wide band gap D–A polymeric donors draw the attention because
of the complementary absorption for efficiently harvesting sunlight.38,39 The D–A copolymers based on the bithienylbenzodithiophene-alt-benzotriazole (BTA) backbone have been confirmed as
highly efficient donor materials for nonfullerene PSCs.40−44 For D–A polymer designing,45 side-chain
engineering was often used to the molecular design,46 especially for fluorine (F). In addition, a number of groups
have verified that the introduction of F atom into BTA units or the
conjugated side groups of the BDT unit is an effective strategy to
raise PCE of the PSCs because of the electronegative effect of F atom
and intermolecular interactions between F atom and other atoms.47−50 These may produce a deep highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO)
energy level for a high open-circuit voltage (Voc) of the PSCs and ordered crystalline structure for a high
hole mobility. For example, Li et al.51 had reported a wide band gap polymer donor named J91, in which the
introduction of two F atoms into the BTA unit and four F atoms into
the side groups of the BDT unit resulted in great enhancement of the
PCE from 4.80% of the polymer J50 without F atoms to 11.63% of the
polymer J91. Interestingly, it seems that the introduction of one
or more F atoms onto the donor unit or/and acceptor unit of D–A
copolymers may result in a distinct influence on the photovoltaic
performance.52−55 For example, Hou and co-workers56 developed
four D–A copolymers based on BDT and thieno[3,4-b]thiophene (TT) to investigate the influence of F atoms at different
positions on the photovoltaic performances. The results indicated
that when one or more F atoms were attached to the BDT unit or TT
unit, the photovoltaic performances of the polymer-based PSCs were
varied greatly. Therefore, how to extend the application of fluorination
in D–A polymers is still interesting and is also of significant
importance to the molecular design of highly efficient photovoltaic
polymers.

Recently, our group had reported several organic acceptors,
such
as thiophene-fused benzotriazole (BTAZT) and thiophene-fused benzothiadiazole
(BTT), to build D–A copolymers for PSCs. It has been found
that the fusion of one thiophene ring at the side of BTAZ or BT unit
can stabilize the quiniod population of the D–A conjugation
backbone, thus to strengthen the intramolecular charge-transfer (ICT)
effect and promote the short-circuit current density (Jsc).57−59 Therefore, in this work, a new BTA-based organic
acceptor, fluorinated thieno[2′,3′:4,5]benzo[1,2-d][1,2,3]triazole (fBTAZT), has been designed, in which
fluorine (F) is introduced at α-position of the fused thiophene
ring at the BTAZT unit to further regulate HOMO–lowest unoccupied
molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels and the photophysical properties.
Then, two D–A copolymers have been synthesized based on the
fBTAZT unit with BDT and fluorinated BDT units, respectively, which
are named PfBTAZT-BDT and PfBTAZT-fBDT and shown in Figure 1. Furthermore, the introduction
of F atoms at BTAZT or/and BDT units to influence the photophysical
and electrochemical properties of the polymers as well as the photovoltaic
performances of the PSCs has been investigated. It is found that fluorination
at BTAZT and BDT units exerts a synergistic effect on the HOMO–LUMO
energy levels and photovoltaic performances of the corresponding D–A
copolymers. Indeed, the polymer PfBTAZT-fBDT introduced fluorine atoms
at both BTAZT and BDT blocks shows the deeper HOMO level, and the
corresponding solar cell device exhibits a relatively high Voc of 0.77 V and PCE of 6.59%.

Results and Discussion
Synthesis and Characterization
In this work, fBTAZT
as a new organic acceptor has been designed and Scheme 1 presents the synthetic process of fBTAZT
unit and two polymers (PfBTAZT-BDT and PfBTAZT-fBDT). As shown, the
initial compounds 1 and 2 (yield, 28.7%)
were synthesized according to the previous paper reported by our group.55 Then, the hydrolysis of 2 produced
ethyl 2-(2-hexyldecyl)-2H-thieno[2′,3′:4,5]benzo[1,2-d][1,2,3]triazole-6-carboxylate (3) (yield,
95%), and the thermal decarboxylation of 3 yielded the
important immediate compound 4 (yield, 87.3%), 2-(2-hexyldecyl)-2H-thieno[2′,3′:4,5]benzo[1,2-d][1,2,3]triazole (BTAZT). Afterward, under the protection of argon,
butyl lithium was applied to remove hydrogen from the α-position
of the fused thiophene at BTAZT and the fluorinating reagent (PhSO2)2NF was added to complete the fluorination to
yield 6-fluoro-2-(2-hexyldecyl)-2H-thieno[2′,3′:4,5]benzo[1,2-d][1,2,3]triazole (fBTAZT) (5) (yield, 59.1%),
which can be acted as a new organic acceptor unit to construct the
D–A copolymer. The rest of the compounds and final monomer
(M1) were synthesized according to the previous paper
reported by our group. The detailed synthetic process is shown in
the Supporting Information, and all of
the compounds were identified by NMR and mass spectrometry. Monomers M2 and M3 were prepared according to the procedure
described in the literature.60 Finally,
two copolymers (PfBTAZT-BDT and PfBTAZT-fBDT) based on fBTAZT and
BDT or fBDT units were synthesized via Stille coupling reaction of M1 with M2 or M3, respectively,
and the detailed synthetic process is shown in the Supporting Information. These two polymers are easily soluble
in some usual organic solvents such as tetrahydrofuran, chloroform,
chlorobenzene, toluene, and so on. The number-average molecular weights
(Mn) and polydispersity indices (PDIs)
were measured by gel permeation chromatography analysis, and the corresponding
data are listed in Table 1. The thermal stability of the two polymers was tested by
the thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). Both of them showed very fine
thermal stability with 5% weight loss beyond 400 °C (Table 1 and Figure S1).

Optical Properties
Figure 2 shows the UV–vis absorption
spectra
of the polymers in dilute chloroform solution and in the thin film,
and the corresponding data are summarized in Table 1. As can be seen, both in the solution and
in thin film, PfBTAZT-BDT and PfBTAZT-fBDT display the similar absorption
spectra with two broad bands in the region of 300–400 and 400–700
nm, respectively. The high-energy band of 300–400 nm is related
to the local π–π* electron transition of conjugated
skeleton, and the low-energy band with stronger absorption in 400–700
nm can be attributed to the ICT effect. It should be noted that PfBTAZT-fBDT
only exhibits a little red-shift absorption compared with PfBTAZT-BDT
both in solution and in thin film. In addition, the absorption in
the thin film also exhibits a little red shift compared with that
in solution for both PfBTAZT-BDT and PfBTAZT-fBDT. This indicates
that there is a strong interchain interaction between the conjugation
backbones in solution and in solid state. As shown in Figure 1, PfBTAZT-BDT has a little
structural difference from PfBTAZT-fBDT where another F atom has been
introduced into the side-chain thiophene ring of the BDT unit. It
seems that the F atom with pair electrons at the backbone of PfBTAZT-fBDT
shows weak electron-donating ability to increase the π-electron
density of BDT, thus to strengthen the ICT effect from the electron-donating
unit (fBDT) to electron-accepting unit (fBTAZT). At the same time,
the presence of more F atoms at the conjugation backbone is favorable
to strengthen the intermolecular interaction among the polymeric main
chains, which can also lead to the red-shift absorption. Moreover,
the fusion of a thiophene ring into the BTAZT unit can stabilize the
quinoid structure of the conjugation backbone and enhance the rigidity
of the main-chain conjugation backbone,61,62 which is beneficial
for the interchain π–π interaction, so these two
polymers only exhibit a little different absorption both in solution
and in solid state. Therefore, it is inferred that synergy of the
fusion of the thiophene ring onto the BTAZT unit and the introduction
of F atom at the BDT unit are attributed to different absorption properties
between PfBTAZT-BDT and PfBTAZT-fBDT. The absorption edges of PfBTAZT-BDT
and PfBTAZT-fBDT from the absorption spectra in the thin film are
estimated to be about 681 and 693 nm, respectively, which corresponds
to the optical band gaps (Egopt) of 1.82 and 1.79 eV. This indicates
that fluorination onto the conjugated side groups of the BDT unit
can slightly decreases the band gap of the polymer42 and both of them belong to the medium band gap semiconductors.

spectra of PfBTAZT-BDT and PfBTAZT-fBDT in CHCl3 solution
and in thin film.

In addition, the extinction
coefficient of PfBTAZT-BDT and PfBTAZT-fBDT
in CHCl3 solution has been measured, as shown in Figure
S3 (Supporting Information). It can be
seen that PfBTAZT-fBDT shows the weaker absorption efficiency in the
region of 450–700 nm compared with PfBTAZT-BDT, although it
has a little red-shift ICT absorption band.

Electrochemical Properties
The HOMO levels of these
two polymers were studied by cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurement,
as shown in Figure 3, and the electrochemical data are also summarized in Table 1.

Figure 3 CV curves of PfBTAZT-BDT
and PfBTAZT-fBDT.

As can be seen from Figure 3, the onset oxidation
potentials of PfBTAZT-BDT and PfBTAZT-fBDT
were estimated to be about 0.94 and 1.04 V, respectively. The corresponding
HOMO energy levels were determined to be −5.27 eV for PfBTAZT-BDT
and −5.37 eV for PfBTAZT-fBDT. At the same time, the corresponding
LUMO energy levels of PfBTAZT-BDT and PfBTAZT-fBDT are also estimated
to be about −3.45 and −3.58 eV, respectively, coming
from the difference between the HOMO energy level and the optical
band gap (shown in Table 1). Because of very strong electronegativity of F atom, the
import of F atom onto the conjugation backbone has become one of the
effective strategies to regulate the HOMO–LUMO energy level
of the acceptor or donors for enhancing the open voltage (Voc), and to strengthen the intermolecular interaction
for improving the charge mobility and further increasing the short-circuit
current density (Jsc) of the PSCs. Obviously,
in this work, the introduction of two F atoms both onto the BTAZT
unit and the side-chain thiophene ring of BDT unit makes PfBTAZT-fBDT
which shows much lower HOMO–LUMO energy levels than PfBTAZT-BDT.
Generally, the lower HOMO energy level is more beneficial to achieve
higher Voc in the PSCs, which has been
observed in the following investigation for the polymer-based PSCs.

The photoluminescence (PL) quenching experiments have been performed
to investigate the charge-transfer behavior in the polymer/ITIC blend
films (Figure S4). As can be seen, when
excited at 700 nm, the PL of ITIC was almost completely quenched when
blended with PfBTAZT-BDT or PfBTAZT-fBDT, suggesting that there is
efficient hole transfer from ITIC to the two polymers. By comparison,
it seems that the hole transfer efficiency from ITIC to PfBTAZT-BDT
is a little better than that to PfBTAZT-BDT. When excited at 600 nm,
the PL of the polymers was also efficiently quenched by ITIC and has
approximately the same quenching efficiency, indicating that there
is efficient electron transfer from polymers to ITIC.

Photovoltaic
Properties
To evaluate the photovoltaic
properties of the polymer-based organic solar cells, ITIC has been
chosen as a small nonfullerene acceptor (A) with these two polymers
(PfBTAZT-BDT or PfBTAZT-fBDT) as the donor (D) to build active layer,
and the corresponding PSC devices with an inverted structure of indium
tin oxide/ZnO/copolymer/ITIC/MoO3/Ag were fabricated. The
active layer was spin-coated from o-dichlorobenzene
solution with different weight ratios of D/A. First of all, three
different ratios for the polymer/ITIC blends (D/A = 1.5:1, 1:1, and
1:1.5 w/w) were scanned to get the optimal D/A ratio (see Table S1
in the Supporting Information). It is found
that two polymer-based devices with a blend ratio of D/A = 1:1 exhibit
the best photovoltaic performances. Then, under the optimal D/A ratio,
some solvent additives including 1,8-diiodooctane, diphenyl ether
(DPE), and 1-chloronaphthalene were chosen to try to modify the morphologies
of the active layer and to further improve the photovoltaic performances.
It was found that for PfBTAZT-BDT-based device, addition of any additives
fails to improve the photovoltaic performances. As for the PfBTAZT-fBDT-based
device, when 2% DPE was added to the polymer/ITIC blend and the active
layer was annealed for 10 min at 110 °C, the PCE is significantly
increased from 5.52 to 6.59%.

The current density–voltage
(J–V) curves of the two PSCs
under the optimal condition are shown in Figure 4a, and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters
are listed in Table 2. As can be seen, the PfBTAZT-BDT-based device shows the Jsc of 14.20 mA cm–2, a Voc of 0.74 V, and a FF of 57.48%, leading to
the PCE of 5.71%, and PfBTAZT-fBDT-based device gives a Jsc of 13.94 mA cm–2, a Voc of 0.77 V, and a FF of 61.82%, leading to the PCE of
6.05%. By comparison, both kind of the devices shows the comparable Jsc for PfBTAZT-BDT (Jsc = 14.20 mA cm–2) and PfBTAZT-fBDT (Jsc = 13.94 mA cm–2) and the latter is
even less than the former. However, the PfBTAZT-fBDT-based device
exhibits higher Voc and FF than those
of the PfBTAZT-BDT. Obviously, the higher Voc of the PfBTAZT-fBDT-based device is attributed to that another F
atom introduced at the BDT unit reduced the HOMO energy level, which
is beneficial for the enhancement of Voc. In addition, the introduction of more F atoms at the conjugation
skeleton is favorable to the interchain interaction and also to improve
the morphologies of the active layer, thus leading to the improvement
of the FF. Therefore, the best PCE of 6.59% for the PfBTAZT-fBDT-based
device is higher than that of PfBTAZT-BDT (PCE = 6.04%), indicating
that the introduction of F atoms onto BDT and BTAZT units has a synergistic
effect on enhancing the output voltage in the device.

Figure 4b shows
incident-photon-to-converted-current efficiency (IPCE) of the PSCs
fabricated under the optimal condition; the corresponding photovoltaic
parameters are listed in Table 2. The IPCE of two polymer-based PSCs displays a photoresponse
in the region of 350–800 nm, covering almost all of the visible
region. Obviously, the IPCE for the PfBTAZT-fBDT-based device exceeds
65% from 550 to 700 nm with a peak over 67% at around 710 nm, but
the maximum IPCE of 60.1% for the PfBTAZT-BDT-based device is much
lower than that of PfBTAZT-fBDT, in which the PfBTAZT-BDT-based device
shows a weaker photoresponse from about 350–430 and 550–750
nm but only a little stronger photoresponse in the very narrow region
from about 430–550 nm, compared with the PfBTAZT-fBDT-based
device. Therefore, the PfBTAZT-BDT-based device exhibits a little
lower PCE than the PfBTAZT-fBDT-based device. In addition, the calculated Jsc values from the integration of EQE data with
the AM 1.5 G reference spectrum are about 13.58 mA cm–2 for PfBTAZT-BDT and 13.71 mA cm–2 for PfBTAZT-fBDT,
which are all within a reasonable range of error (<5%).

In
order to further understand the effect of fluorinated BDT and
BTAZT units on the Jsc and FF of the PSCs,
we got the hole and electron mobility of the blend films by the space-charge-limited-current
(SCLC) method (Figure S2). The hole and
electron mobilities for the two blend films are shown in Table S2. The hole (μh)/electron
(μe) mobilities are calculated to be 2.25 ×
10–4/1.01 × 10–4 and 3.04
× 10–4/4.5 × 10–4 cm2 V–1 s–1 for PfBTAZT-BDT/ITIC
blend film and PfBTAZT-fBDT/ITIC blend film, respectively. Apparently,
the PfBTAZT-fBDT/ITIC blend film exhibits higher charge carrier mobilities
than that of the PfBTAZT-BDT/ITIC blend film, suggesting that the
better molecular packing occurs when introducing fluorine atoms simultaneously
at the BTAZT and BDT units that strengthen the intramolecular and
intermolecular interactions.

Morphological Characterization
Atomic
force microscopy
(AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were measured to
evaluate the morphologies of polymer/ITIC active layer films. As can
be seen in Figure 5a,b, the obtained root-mean-square (rms) roughness with 2.02 and
1.84 nm was observed for the PfBTAZT-BDT/ITIC blend film and PfBTAZT-fBDT/ITIC
blend film, respectively. Because the PfBTAZT-BDT/ITIC blend film
and PfBTAZT-fBDT/ITIC blend
film have little different rms, they also show the comparable Jsc, which is in agreement with the experimental
results. However, it can be seen from the AFM phase images of Figure 5c–d and TEM
images of Figure 5e–f,
the fBTAZT-fBDT/ITIC blend film seems to exhibit much clearer phase
separation and more uniform morphology, indicating that the PfBTAZT-fBDT/ITIC
blend film has more efficient charge separation and transport ability.
Thus, the PSCs based on the PfBTAZT-fBDT/ITIC blend film exhibit better
FF and PCE, which is because the presence of more F atoms at the conjugation
backbone does favor to strengthen the intermolecular interaction among
the polymeric main chains and improve the morphologies of the polymer/ITIC
blend film.

blend films; TEM images of (e) PfBTAZT-BDT/ITIC and (f) PfBTAZT-fBDT/ITIC
blend films under the optimal condition.

In addition, the X-ray diffraction experiment has been performed
to measure the molecular packing of the two blend films (polymers/ITIC
= 1:1), as shown in Figure S5. As can be
seen, the PfBTAZT-fBDT/ITIC blend film obviously exhibits stronger
and sharper diffraction peaks than the PfBTAZT-BDT/ITIC blend film.
This implies that the intermolecular stackings for the PfBTAZT-fBDT/ITIC
blend film are more well ordered, which is favorable for improving
charge transfer of the PSCs.

Conclusions
In
summary, the fBTAZT unit has been designed and synthesized and
it has been applied to build two new D–A copolymers with the
none/fluorine-substituted benzodithiophene (BDT) donor unit for PSCs.
The measurements based on UV–vis spectroscopy and CV indicated
that fluorination at both of the BTAZT unit and BDT unit shows the
synergistic effect on photophysical and electrochemical properties,
in which PfBTAZT-fBDT with another F atom at the side-chain thiophene
ring of the BDT unit exhibits a little more red-shift absorption and
deeper HOMO–LUMO energy levels than PfBTAZT-BDT without no
F atom at the BDT unit. The photovoltaic performances of the PSCs
based on the polymers as the donor and ITIC as the acceptor have been
investigated, and it is found that PfBTAZT-fBDT-based devices exhibit
higher Voc than the PfBTAZT-BDT, which
is attributed to its lower HOMO energy level because of more fluorine
atoms introduced onto the conjugation backbone. Moreover, fluorination
both into the BTAZT unit and the side-chain thiophene ring of the
BDT unit in PfBTAZT-fBDT strengthens the intermolecular interaction,
which can improve the charge mobility and morphology of the active
layer, thus leading to higher FF and better PCE.
