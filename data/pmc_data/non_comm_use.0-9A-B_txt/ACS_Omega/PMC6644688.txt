==== Body
Introduction
Catalytic enantioselective desymmetrization of meso-epoxides is
an attractive method to prepare chiral alcohols1 because the meso-epoxide substrates are readily available
and the 1,2-difunctionalized product structures with two adjacent
chiral centers are very useful synthetic building blocks.2 Various nucleophiles have been reported to participate
in catalytic enantioselective desymmetrization of meso-epoxides, including
amines,3 azides,4 alcohols,5 carboxylic acids,6 thiols,7 and halides.8 The majority of these reactions were catalyzed
by Lewis acidic transition metal complexes.1 In 2013, Sun et al. successfully realized the first Brønsted
acid-catalyzed enantioselective desymmetrization of meso-epoxides
by 2-mercaptobenzothiazoles.7d In that
report, 1,1′-bi-2-naphthol (BINOL)-derived chiral phosphoric
acid bearing 3,3′-(2,4,6-triisopropyl) substituents (commonly
abbreviated as TRIP) was identified to be a good catalyst, and up
to 92.5:7.5 er was obtained for the ring opening reaction of cyclohexene
oxide.

While the research endeavor on strong Brønsted acid catalysis
was dominated by BINOL-based chiral phosphoric acid derivatives9 since the pioneering works from Akiyama et al.
and Terada et al.,10 syntheses of this
class of catalysts were generally considered lengthy, laborious, and
expensive, especially for some of the most successful chiral phosphoric
acid-derived catalysts bearing bulky 3,3′-substituents, such
as TRIP. Simplifying the preparation of strong Brønsted acid
catalysts could be synthetically very useful.11

In 2016, Lambert et al. reported a novel, enantiopure, pentacarboxycyclopentadiene
(PCCP)-based strong Brønsted acid catalyst, which could be easily
prepared from readily available 1,2,3,4,5-pentacarbomethoxycyclopentadiene
and chiral (−)-menthol in one transesterification step.12 Catalytic asymmetric Mukaiyama–Mannich
reactions and oxocarbenium aldol reactions were realized in good enantioselectivities
(Scheme 1a).12 Recently, Diels–Alder reactions between
salicylaldehyde acetals and vinyl ethers catalyzed by a different
PCCP catalyst were also reported.13 Other
groups have also reported transfer hydrogenations and preparations
of chiral aminals using Lambert’s catalyst.14 We believe that the development of PCCP-based chiral strong
Brønsted acid catalyst could potentially alleviate some of the
problematic issues for using BINOL-based chiral phosphoric acid derivatives.
Herein, we report the enantioselective desymmetrization of meso-epoxides
by 2-mercaptobenzothiazoles using the PCCP-based chiral Brønsted
acid with up to 90.5:9.5 er (Scheme 1b).

Scheme 1 Chiral PCCP-Based Brønsted Acid-Catalyzed Reactions
Results and Discussion
We used the ring opening reaction of cyclohexene oxide (1a) with 2-mercaptobenzothiazole (2a) with chiral Brønsted
acid catalyst 1 as the model for optimization of reaction
conditions. Initial trial in dichloromethane (DCM) solvent at room
temperature (rt) overnight without the addition of chiral catalyst
gave racemic product 3a in 18% background yield (Table 1, entry 1). When 2.5
mol % PCCP-based catalyst derived from chiral (−)-menthol was
used, 93% isolated yield and 57:43 er were obtained (entry 2).15 We then screened a number of solvents for this
reaction (entries 3–15). The best result (99% yield, 72:28
er) was obtained when chloroform was used as solvent (entry 8). We
then tried to enhance the selectivity by lowering the reaction temperature.
However, the enantioselectivity decreased to 60.5:39.5 er at 0 °C
(entry 16) and 40.5:59.5 er at −44 °C (entry 17), which
probably means that the favored transition state for the stereochemistry
determining step might be reversed at lower temperatures. Further
increasing the reaction temperature to 30 °C led to 99% yield
and 70.5:29.5 er (entry 18).

We then tried a number of other sulfur and nitrogen nucleophiles
for the ring opening reaction of cyclohexene oxide (1a), but none of the results seemed promising (see Supporting Information for details). However, the addition
of catalytic quantity of amine bases to react with the PCCP-based
chiral Brønsted acid catalyst and form corresponding hydrogen-bonding
adducts or ammonium salts did have some favorable effects on the enantioselectivity
(Table 2). Specifically,
triethylamine and diisopropylamine gave poor yields and enantioselectivities
(entries 1 and 2), but a number of aniline derivatives and pyridine
derivatives (entries 3–12) all gave full conversion to the
desired product 3a and in certain cases increased enantioselectivities
comparing with the result we obtained using the chiral Brønsted
acid catalyst 1 alone (entry 13). When N-isopropylaniline 4a was used (entry 4), we achieved
the highest 74:26 er, whereas using half or double amount of 4a did not help to increase the enantioselectivity (entries
11 and 12). Presumably, the aniline- and pyridine-type bases (entries
3–12) could form more tightly associated hydrogen-bonding adducts
or ammonium salts with the PCCP-based chiral Brønsted acid catalyst
through π–π stacking interactions and thus achieve
higher enantioselectivity than triethylamine and diisopropylamine
(entries 1 and 2).

Further enhancement of enantioselectivity was achieved by using
chiral Brønsted acid catalyst 2, which was similarly
synthesized using Lambert’s protocol with readily available
(−)-8-phenylmenthol as the chiral source. Under the optimized
reaction conditions (see Table S2 in the Supporting Information for details on the temperature optimization for catalyst 2), 99% yield and 89.5:10.5 er were obtained for
product 3a (Table 3, entry 1). The increased steric bulkiness of catalyst
2 might contribute to its better performance. We then surveyed
a number of substituted 2-mercaptobenzothiazoles, and modest-to-good
enantioselectivities were obtained (entries 2–10). Up to 99%
yield and 90.5:9.5 er of product 3c were achieved using
the 5-trifluoromethoxy-2-mercaptobenzothiazole (2c) as
nucleophile for this ring opening reaction with cyclohexene oxide
(1a). 2-Mercaptobenzothiazole nucleophiles with electron-donating
or electron-neutral substituents generally gave better results (entries
1–8). The low yield for product 3g was probably
due to the poor solubility of substrate 2g under the
reaction conditions (entry 7). For substrates containing electron-withdrawing
substituents, lower yields and er’s were obtained (entries
9–10). When the reaction between substrates 1a and 2a was conducted on 5 mmol scale, the product 3a was also obtained in 99% yield and 89:11 er, and 89% of catalyst 2 was recovered, which showed the same catalytic
activity for further reactions.

We then explored the substrate scope for meso-epoxides using 10
mol % catalyst loading for the sake of slightly better enantioselectivity
(Table 4). We should
also note that the best enantioselectivity for different epoxides
were obtained at either 15 or 30 °C but generally decreased at
temperatures higher than 30 °C (see Table S3 in the Supporting Information for details). Epoxide
ring opening products 3a, 3l, 3m, and 3p were obtained with better enantioselectivities
(entries 1, 3, 4, and 7), while the results for 3k, 3n, and 3o were moderate (entries 2, 5, 6). The
double epoxide ring opening reaction of substrate 1h with
2.2 equiv 2a gave the desired product 3q with 89:11 er with moderate isolated yield.

Conclusions
In conclusion, we identified the (−)-8-phenylmenthol-derived
chiral PCCP-based Brønsted acid combined with equal molar amount
of amine additive N-isopropylaniline as an efficient
catalyst system for the enantioselective desymmetrization of meso-epoxides
by 2-mercaptobenzothiazoles. Up to 99% yield and 90.5:9.5 er of the
ring opening product were obtained for this reaction, showcasing the
potential for further development and application of Lambert’s
PCCP-based Brønsted acid catalysts. Other research along this
line will be reported in due course.

chromatography was performed on silica gel 60-F254-coated 0.2 mm plates.
Flash column chromatography was performed using silica gel (200–300
mesh). All reagents were purchased from commercial suppliers and used
without further purification unless otherwise noted. All solvents
were purchased from commercial suppliers and purified by standard
techniques. The enantiomeric excesses were determined by HPLC analysis,
which employed a chiral stationary phase column specified in the individual
experiment, by comparing the samples with the appropriate racemic
mixtures. The meso-epoxides 1c,161d,171e,171f,6b1g,18 and 1h(19) were prepared according to the reported
literature procedures.

The PCCP catalysts 1 and 2 were prepared according to the reported literature procedures.20 Pentacarbomethoxycyclopentadiene (307 mg, 0.86
mmol), (1R,2S,5R)-(−)-8-phenylmenthol (2.00 g, 8.61 mmol, 97%), and N-methylimidazole (0.412 mL, 5.16 mmol) were dissolved in
8.6 mL of toluene (0.1 M) in a two-neck flask. A steady flow of dry
N2 was allowed for the removal of methanol. The reaction
solution was stirred at 125 °C in an oil bath for 48 h. Upon
completion, the reaction was cooled down to rt and concentrated in
vacuo. The crude material was purified by silica gel chromatography
(0 → 5% MeOH/CH2Cl2), washed with 1 M
HCl/CH2Cl2 (3×), and dried with anhydrous
MgSO4 to afford catalyst 2.

of potassium ethylxanthate (1.76 g, 11.0 mmol) in dimethylformamide
(7.5 mL) was added 2-bromo-5-methoxyaniline (1.00 g, 5.0 mmol). The
reaction mixture was stirred for 12 h at 120 °C in an oil bath.
After cooling down to rt, the reaction mixture was poured into ice
water (200 mL), followed by adding 1 M HCl until pH = 2. Then, the
mixture was filtered and the cake was washed by deionized water, dried
under infrared, and then recrystallized from chloroform. Then, the
solid was dissolved in EtOAc, stirred with 200 mg activated charcoal
(powder) for 30 min at rt, and filtered through celite to yield 5-methoxybenzo[d]thiazole-2-thiol (2b) as a white solid (221
