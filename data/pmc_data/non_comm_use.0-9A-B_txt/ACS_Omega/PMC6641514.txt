We report the direct and dry deposition
of transparent conducting
films (TCFs) of aerosol-synthesized single-walled carbon nanotubes
(SWNTs) using a thermophoretic precipitator (TP) designed for the
uniform and efficient deposition of aerosol-synthesized nanomaterials
on 50 mm wafers or similarly sized polymer substrates. The optical
and electrical performance of the fabricated TCFs match or surpass
the published results achieved using a filter-based collection of
aerosol-synthesized SWNTs, and TCFs with sheet resistances of 60 Ω/sq.
at 87.8% transmittance and 199 Ω/sq. at 96% transmittance on
flexible polymer substrates are demonstrated. The precipitator design
is immediately applicable in roll-to-roll fabrication of SWNT TCFs
or other functional coatings of aerosol-synthesized nanomaterials.

Introduction
Thin
films of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) are an appealing
material for transparent conducting films (TCFs) due to their conductivity,
flexibility, and low refractive index, with the potential applications
in, e.g., touch displays and photovoltaics.1 As a particular advantage and in contrast to conventional TCF materials
such as doped metal oxides, the mechanically robust structure of SWNT-based
TCFs makes them applicable in flexible and stretchable electronics.2 Although SWNT TCFs can be prepared from liquid
dispersions of SWNTs by a wide range of coating and printing methods,
surfactant contamination and structural damage to the SWNTs caused
by dispersion steps limit their performance and applicability. High-performance
SWNT TCFs3 have been previously fabricated
by a dry, dispersion-free technique based on collecting the SWNTs,
grown in the gas phase using a floating catalyst chemical vapor deposition
(FC-CVD) process, on a membrane filter and transferring the SWNT thin
film formed on the filter on a target substrate by simply pressing
the filter on it.4 However, the applicability
of this method is limited by the availability and cost of suitable
filters, it can only be used when the adhesion of the SWNTs on the
substrate is stronger than that on the filter membrane, and it requires
that the film is thick and forms a continuous, interlinked structure.
In addition to filtration, aerosol-synthesized nanomaterials such
as FC-CVD SWNTs can be also efficiently deposited using electric fields
or temperature gradients in electrostatic5 or thermophoretic6 precipitators (ESP,
TP), both of which are widely utilized in aerosol sampling. The usefulness
of ESPs for the deposition of thin films and coatings, such as SWNT
TCFs, is limited by the low charging efficiency of nanoparticles,7 charging in SWNT aerosols may be increased by
gas-phase bundling,8,9 detrimental to TCF performance,10 and the uniformity and morphology of SWNTs deposited
using ESPs are typically nonideal.11,12 Conversely,
sampling by thermophoresis has the advantage that the deposition rate
of nanoscale aerosol particles is generally assumed to be independent
of the particle size and morphology, although relatively high-temperature
gradients are required to achieve a high deposition efficiency. Because
the diameters of engineered nanoparticles dp are typically close to or smaller than the mean free path of the
surrounding gas molecules, the engineering analysis of TPs is commonly
based on the free molecular regime model of Waldmann.13 Briefly, when the thermophoretic
force exerted on the aerosol particle by a surrounding temperature
gradient is balanced with the free-molecular drag force, the result
is a dp-independent terminal velocity vth of the form 1  where μg is the gas viscosity,
∇T is the temperature gradient, φ is
the momentum accommodation factor, typically assumed to be 0.9, ρg is the gas density, and T is the particle
temperature. It should be noted, however, that the assumptions of
a constant momentum accommodation factor and rigid-body collisions
in eq 1 may not be valid
when the diameter of the particle or SWNT, dp, is on the order of single nanometers. Li and Wang14 have proposed modified forms for the drag and
thermophoretic forces, accounting for intermolecular forces between
the gas molecules and the particle, and the size dependence of φ,
resulting in 2  where the reduced collision
integrals Ωavg(1,2), tabulated
in Li and Wang,14 describe the forces,
averaged over diffuse and specular scattering, in the case of the
drag (l = 1) and the thermophoretic force (l = 2). Depending on the temperature and dp, eq 2 may
predict a vth even orders of magnitude
lower than eq 1. Previously,
we have observed6 that the vths of SWNTs with diameters between 1.2 and 1.9 nm were
lower than those predicted by eq 1, and showed a a diameter dependence similar to that predicted
by eq 2, although the
measured values (35–43% of eq 1) were lower than those predicted by eq 2. Similar observations have been
reported by Zhang et al.,15 who deposited
titanium oxide nanoparticles with dp between
6.5 and 14 nm.

TPs have been previously used to evaluate the
aerosol size distributions16 and exposures
to nanoscale aerosols,17,18 and to deposit functional coatings
of aerosol-synthesized nanoparticles,12,19,20 FC-CVD SWNTs6 and catalyst
nanoparticles for supported CVD growth of
SWNTs,21,22 but to date, no reports of SWNT TCFs fabricated
using thermophoretic deposition have been published. With the exception
of a design by Holunga et al.,12 capable
of uniform deposition on a stationary 150 mm wafer, TPs reported in
the literature are typically designed for sampling on microscopy grids
or similar small substrates. Here, we present the fabrication of SWNT
TCFs based on the direct deposition of FC-CVD SWNTs using a TP designed
for the uniform deposition of aerosol-synthesized nanomaterials on
50 mm wafers or polymer substrates of a similar size. The scale of
the system is chosen to keep the deposition times reasonable when
using a laboratory-scale FC-CVD process for SWNT synthesis, and so
the entire surface of the substrate can be imaged using a standard
scanning electron microscope (SEM). However, the geometry is readily
scalable and can be used in a roll-to-roll process, particularly when
used together with a high-yield process or multiple consequential
reactors. The design is not specific to the SWNTs synthesized using
a FC-CVD process covered here and could be also used to deposit coatings
of other aerosol-synthesized functional materials, such as nanoparticles
produced using an evaporation–nucleation process,23 flame synthesis20 or spark discharge generators,24 or nanowires
grown by aerotaxy.25

Results and Discussion
A cut-out graphic and a side profile of the TP designed for the
purpose of this work are presented in Figure 1a,b. The aerosol enters through a 25 mm vacuum
flange connected to a conical expansion (height 100 mm, top diameter
65 mm, bottom diameter 95 mm) and passes through a rectangular, 60
mm long, and 0.4 mm wide orifice in a hot plate heated using thin-film
resistors (Omega Engineering Ltd., U.K.) using a power of 56 W. The
target substrate is placed on a water-cooled stage, with lateral dimensions
of 100 × 90 mm2. The stage can be moved using stepper
motors controlled by a positioning controller (PI GmbH & Co. KG,
Germany) in the direction perpendicular to the orifice and vertically
to adjust the distance and temperature gradient between the substrate
and the hot plate. To increase the uniformity of the deposited film,
the sample stage is oscillated under the orifice, as shown in Figure 1c. A stage movement
speed of 1.25 mm/s is used in all of the experiments. The carrier
gas exits through two 1/4 in. outlets parallel to the ends of the
orifice placed symmetrically 20 mm below the top of the lower chamber
of the TP. In the experiments described here, the hot plate is heated
to a temperature of 90 °C and the sample chuck is held at an
ambient temperature of ca. 23 °C using water cooling. The distance
between the substrate and the hot plate is kept at 0.75 mm, corresponding
to a temperature gradient of approximately 9.3 × 104 K/m in the region between the hot plate and the substrate. For the
deposition of SWNTs, the inlet of the TP is connected to the outlet
of a FC-CVD reactor, described in detail earlier,4,26 and
a volume flow of 300 cm3/min is sampled from the reactor
through the TP using a vacuum line controlled by a needle valve. The
high deposition efficiency of the design is confirmed by sampling
a condensation particle counter (CPC) with a sample flow of 300 cm3/min to the outlet of the TP and sampling the output of the
FC-CVD process alternatively through the heated TP and piece of 1/4″
stainless steel tubing with a similar distance between the inlet and
the outlet. The aerosol number concentration sampled through the TP
is approximately 2.5% of the concentration sampled through the bypass
line, as shown in Figure 1d, indicating a high deposition efficiency.

efficiency. (a) A schematic illustration of the TP design. (b) A profile

(c) Oscillation procedure for depositing uniform thin films. The initial
distance of the wafer edge and orifice is 1 mm. (d) Deposition efficiency,
as measured by CPC. The aerosol number concentration measured through
the heated TP, when a temperature gradient of 9.3 × 104 K/m is applied over a 0.75 mm distance between the hot plate and
the substrate, is approximately 2.5% of the concentration measured
through a bypass line of similar path length, indicating a high deposition
efficiency.

The spatial uniformity
of the deposited SWNTs is evaluated based
on the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) of the near-monolayer films
deposited on 50 mm Si/SiO2 wafers. When no temperature
gradient is applied, few SWNTs (none or a few in a SEM micrograph
of 57 μm × 43 μm), likely deposited by diffusion,
are observed on the wafer. This indicates that SWNTs and particles
with smaller aerodynamic diameters will not deposit by inertial impaction
in the geometry used here. The observed SWNT density on a wafer kept
stationary under the orifice is shown in Figure 2a. SWNTs are observed only on a 20 mm wide
region centered on the orifice, with a density inversely proportional
to the distance from the orifice. When the wafer is oscillated according
to the procedure shown in Figure 1c, a highly uniform coating of SWNTs is observed and
the measured SWNT density across the wafer, shown in Figure 2b, is observed to be within
20% of its mean value. We suggest that the main source of the nonuniformity
is possibly a slight tilt between the stage and the hot plate, which
are difficult to align perfectly in the academic workshop the TP has
been built in.

a static wafer, determined by SEM. The directions of the arrows indicate
the mean orientation observed and their lengths indicate the magnitude

marked by an asterisk and a cross. The dashed circles corresponds
to uniform orientation distributions. (d) Simulated velocity field
of the carrier gas in the middle of the 0.75 mm gap between the top
of the substrate (a 50 mm wafer) and the hot plate.

To guide the design process and to interpret the
experimental observations,
the flow and temperature fields inside the TP are investigated using
computational fluid dynamics and heat transfer simulations. The simulated
velocity field between the substrate and the hot plate is shown in Figure 2c. As noted previously
by Holunga et al.,12 heating of the inlet
may be necessary at higher volume flow rates to prevent the ambient-temperature
carrier gas from disturbing the temperature gradient inside the TP.
Based on the simulations, the heat transfer caused by an ambient-temperature
inlet volume flow of 300 cm3/min is expected to have a
minor effect on the temperature gradient in the design presented here;
the results are included as the Supporting Information. The deposited SWNTs are observed to orient themselves with the
flow to an extent, similarly to what we have reported in a previous
study using a smaller TP.6 Their orientation
distributions are determined using gtFiber, an automatic tool for
the analysis of micrographs of fibrous materials,27 and an example of an analyzed micrograph is included as
the Supporting Information. The orientations
of the SWNTs deposited on a stationary wafer match the orientation
of the simulated velocity field shown in Figure 2c well, indicating that the simulated velocity
field is realistic, and that similar modeling can be used to scale
the design up to larger substrates or flow rates. The orientation
is quantified using the two-dimensional (2D) order parameter 3  where θn is the angle between
an individual fiber pixel and the average orientation of the entire
image. On a wafer oscillated under the orifice, the orientation pattern,
included as the Supporting Information,
is more uniform and the strength of the alignment is smaller, as expected.
The alignment of fibrous or rodlike particles such as SWNTs is expected
to depend both on the flow velocity and the particle dimensions; this
is discussed further in the Supporting Information.

To demonstrate the applicability of the thermophoretically
deposited
SWNT coating as TCFs, we deposited thin films on 50 mm borosilicate
wafers (thickness 500 μm) and 50 × 50 mm2 poly(ethylene
terephthalate) (PET) sheets (thickness 100 μm). The glass wafers
and the PET sheets are attached on the stage by a copper tape, also
to mask their edges so that they could be handled without scratching
the TCF. The deposited TCFs on a borosilicate glass are hole doped28 by drop-casting nitric acid (HNO3) on them. Interestingly, HNO3 cannot be used on films
deposited on the PET because it cannot wet the SWNT coating and instead,
gold(III) chloride29 in acetonitrile is
used. For a comparison with earlier published data, we also collect
the films from the same process on nitrocellulose membrane filters
and press transferred them on quartz windows and smaller PET sheets.
Plots of the TCF performance, expressed in terms of their sheet resistance
and optical transmittance at a reference wavelength of 550 nm, are
shown in Figure 3a,b.
The TCFs fabricated using a press transfer show a performance expected
from the synthesis process, with a sheet resistance of approximately
100 Ω/sq. at an optical transmittance of 90%, measured at 550
nm. Previously, Kaskela et al.4 have used
a figure of merit 4  where Rs is the
sheet resistance and T is the optical transmittance
measured at 550 nm to describe the performance of different SWNT TCFs.
Fits of eq 4 on the data
measured from the press transferred films are included in Figure 3a,b, to facilitate
a comparison of the deposition methods. Pristine TCFs deposited by
TP show a slightly higher performance than the press-transferred TCFs
on both glass and PET, which can partially result from the measurement
procedure: Because a larger number of measurements are carried out
per sample, the TCFs deposited by TP are exposed to ambient water
and oxygen, which may dope the TCFs to a limited extent, for a longer
time. We also expect that when depositing by TP, the deposited pristine
SWNT film is more tightly packed because, on the filter, the top layer
of the already deposited SWNTs acts as an extension of the filter
membrane, preventing the SWNT aerosol from reaching its surface and
forming an effectively three-dimensional structure. The local morphology
of the SWNTs deposited using both methods is also investigated using
atomic force microscopy (AFM) and micrographs and height profile measurements
are included as the Supporting Information. After doping, the TCFs deposited using both filtration and the
TP show comparable performance on both glass and PET substrates. The
limited alignment of the deposited SWNTs does not result in measurable
anisotropy in the sheet resistance; details are included in the Supporting Information. UV–vis–NIR
absorption spectra of the thermophoretically deposited TCFs on borosilicate
glass and visible absorption spectra of TCFs on PET, shown in Figure 3c and measured at
the locations indicated by Figure 3g, display the expected spectral features associated
with SWNT electronic transitions. The observed variation in the thermophoretically
deposited TCF properties on glass show similar variation as the density
observed by SEM, and all of the data obtained on the same wafer fit
within approximately ±20% of its average when expressed by the
reciprocal sheet resistance or absorbance, both of which are expected
to depend linearly on the SWNT density. Meanwhile, the observed spatial
variation on PET is much lower, approximately ±7%, which could
result from the fact that a possible misalignment of the sample stage
has a lesser effect on the flow when the substrate is thinner. The
obtained TCF performance on PET, with K = 125 kΩ–1, corresponds to a value of ca. 76 Ω/sq. at
90% and is highly competitive with indium-doped tin oxide and other
conventional TCF materials on flexible substrates.

Conclusions
We have designed a thermophoretic
precipitator capable of depositing
wafer-scale coatings of aerosol-synthesized nanomaterials, such as
SWNTs grown using the FC-CVD process. As a demonstration of a functional
coating fabricated using the precipitator, the TCFs deposited from
the SWNTs synthesized using a FC-CVD process show a good uniformity
and a high performance comparable or superior to previously reported
high-performance TCFs fabricated using the same synthesis method and
a filter-based transfer process. The method shows particular promise
for the TCF deposition on flexible polymer substrates on which SWNT-based
TCFs are highly competitive with currently used industrial materials,
and it can be also used to deposit SWNTs on mechanically fragile or
low–surface energy substrates. The precipitator design presented
here is readily scalable for larger substrates or processes with higher
flow rates, and can be utilized in a roll-to-roll fabrication process.

Methods
SWNT Synthesis
and Deposition
The SWNTs were synthesized
with a FC-CVD process described in detail earlier, with the difference
that here a higher concentration was used to keep the deposition times
reasonable on the chosen substrates, and the decreased TCF performance
caused by bundling10,26 was compensated by using a longer
reactor (a furnace height of 87 cm and a 105 cm quartz work tube,
compared to a furnace height of 55.5 cm and an 85 cm quartz work tube
in the system reported previously26) and
a higher CO2 concentration, yielding the SWNTs with a mean
length of 7.6 μm based on SEM, and a mean diameter of ca. 2.0
nm based on the UV–vis–NIR absorption spectroscopy.
The length distribution of the SWNTs and a representative absorption
spectrum are included as the Supporting Information. A total flow of 400 cm3/min of carbon monoxide (CO,
99.5%, AGA, Finland) was introduced into a vertical reactor consisting
of a quartz work tube (length 1050 mm, external diameter 28 mm, wall
thickness 2.2 mm, Finnish Specialglass Oy, Finland) inserted in a
furnace (Entech, Sweden) held at a set maximum temperature of 850
°C. A 200 cm3/min flow of CO was introduced to the
reactor through a water-cooled injector to create a suitable temperature
gradient for ferrocene decomposition and catalyst particle formation
at the top of the reactor, a 100 cm3/min flow was mixed
with ferrocene and introduced through the water-cooled injector and
a 100 cm3/min flow was introduced in the space between
the water-cooled injector and the work tube to prevent recirculation
at the top of the furnace. Additionally, a 2 cm3/min flow
of carbon dioxide (CO2, 99.9993%, AGA, Finland) was introduced
to increase the mean diameter and length of the grown SWNTs.30 The SWNTs were collected from the reactor effluent
either using the thermophoretic precipitator or nitrocellulose membrane
filters (diameter 13 mm, pore size 0.45 μm, Millipore).

Aerosol
Concentration Measurements
The number concentration
of the FC-CVD process effluent and the deposition efficiency of the
TP were determined using a condensation particle counter (model 5414
CPC; cutoff size, d50 = 4 nm; GRIMM Aerosol
Technik GmbH, Germany).

Finite-Element Simulations
Simulations
of the gas flow
and heat transfer in the TP were carried out with COMSOL Multiphysics
5.3, a commercial partial differential equation solver based on the
finite-element method. A depiction of the geometry and mesh used in
the simulations are included as the Supporting Information.

Thin-Film Characterization and Doping
The sheet resistances
of the TCFs were measured using a four-point probe (Jandel Engineering
Ltd., U.K., tip radius 250 μm, tip spacing 1 mm, loading 60
g) connected to a multimeter (HP 3458, Hewlett Packard), and UV–vis–NIR
absorption spectra were measured using an Agilent Cary 5000 UV–vis–NIR
spectrophotometer (Agilent Technologies, Inc.). The deposited TCFs
on the borosilicate glass were hole doped28 by drop-casting nitric acid (HNO3, 70%, ACS reagent grade)
on the film, waiting for 60 s, and washing the film with deionized
water. The deposited TCFs on a borosilicate glass were hole doped
using a 16 mM solution of gold(III) chloride29 (AuCl3, ≥99.99%, Sigma-Aldrich) in acetonitrile
(99.999%, Sigma-Aldrich). The solution was drop-casted on the film,
left in place for 5 min, and washed off with acetonitrile.

Scanning
Electron Microscopy and Atomic Force Microscopy
Scanning
electron microscopy was carried out using a Zeiss SIGMA
VP SEM (Carl Zeiss GmbH, Germany), and the density of the SWNTs was
determined by analyzing the number of peaks in SEM scanlines, similarly
to our earlier published work.6 Atomic
force microscopy was carried out using a Veeco Dimension 5000 AFM
operated in intermittent contact (tapping) mode.
