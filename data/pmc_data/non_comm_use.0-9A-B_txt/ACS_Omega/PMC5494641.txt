Freestanding fibrous matrices with
proper protein composition and
desirable mechanical properties, stability, and biocompatibility are
in high demand for tissue engineering. Electrospun (E-spun) collagen–silk
composite fibers are promising tissue engineering scaffolds. However,
as-spun fibers are mechanically weak and unstable. In this work, we
applied glutaraldehyde (GA) vapor treatment to improve the fiber performance,
and the effect on the properties of E-spun collagen–silk fibers
was studied systematically. GA treatment was found to affect collagen
and silk distinctively. Whereas GA chemically links collagen peptides,
it induces conformational transitions to enrich β-sheets in
silk. The combined effects impose a control of the mechanical properties,
stability, and degradability of the composite fibers, which are dependent
on the extent of GA treatment. In addition, a mild treatment of the
fibers did not diminish cell proliferation and viability. However,
overly treated fibers demonstrated reduced cell–matrix adhesion.
The understanding of GA treatment effects on collagen, silk, and the
composite fibers enables effective control and fine tuning of the
fiber properties to warrant their diverse in vitro and in vivo applications.

Introduction
Tissue engineering
scaffolds with appropriate chemical composition,
topographical features, mechanical properties, stability, and degradability
are essential to support cell development and tissue remodeling. Among
a variety of techniques for fabricating biomaterial scaffolds, electrospinning
has gained considerable interest because the process is remarkably
efficient, rapid, and inexpensive, and the electrospun (E-spun) nanofibrous
architecture is similar to the naturally occurring protein fibrils
in the extracellular environment.1,2 As a major
component of the extracellular matrix, collagen type I has been widely
adopted for electrospinning to generate fibers with diameters ranging
from less than 100 nm to a few microns mimicking native collagen fibrils.3−5 The interaction between collagen type I and cell membrane proteins,
such as β-1 integrin, is known to regulate cell attachment,
growth, and differentiation.6−8 The properties of E-spun collagen
scaffolds were often manipulated by incorporating various synthetic
and/or natural materials.9−11 Dragline silk protein has been
widely considered a promising biomaterial due to its superior mechanical
strength and good in vitro and in vivo biocompatibility.12,13 The unique combination of highly organized β-sheet crystalline
domains of an alanine-rich motif and amorphous matrix of a glycine-rich
motif in silk is accountable for its high tensile strength and extensibility.14,15

In a previous work, we established the method to fabricate
unidirectionally
aligned collagen–silk composite microfibers using a home-built
electrospinning system.16 The aligned fibers
mimicked the locally oriented collagen fibers in native tissues. The
incorporation of synthetic spider dragline silk proteins in collagen
significantly enhanced the mechanical strength and stability of the
E-spun fibers. Composite fibers with a low silk content (15 or 30%
silk) were considered the most favorable scaffolds for potential neural
tissue engineering application due to the optimal balance in biochemical
and biophysical properties to support rapid neural differentiation
of stem cells. However, unlike native collagen fibrils that are stable
in aqueous media, the E-spun collagen fibers were found unstable in
water, tissue fluid, or blood.17−19 Different from native silk fibers,
the as-spun silk fibers were much weaker. Posttreatments, such as
chemical cross-linking for collagen17,20−23 and solvent-induced crystallization of β sheets for silk fibers,24−28 were often carried out to improve the fiber performance. To our
best knowledge, posttreatment methods to suit collagen–silk
composite fibers have not been explored extensively.

Glutaraldehyde
(GA) is commonly used as a cross-linking agent for
collagen-based biomaterials.29,30 Among various cross-linking
protocols, GA vapor treatment is most widely used because it is easy
to control and can avoid the collapse of the E-spun fiber matrix during
cross-linking in an aqueous environment.3,17,23,31 It was also found by
us and other groups that GA treatment can enhance the mechanical properties
of silk-based materials.32−34 However, the protocols of GA
vapor treatment established by different groups vary remarkably, with
the concentration ranging from 0.5 to 50% and the treatment time from
12 h to 4 days.3,17,23,31,35 Such a large
variation can lead to huge discrepancies in the properties of E-spun
fibers and make results obtained by different groups inconsistent
and incomparable. It is imperative to perform a systematic study to
delve into the mechanism of GA treatment on collagen and silk and
to examine the effectiveness of such a treatment on E-spun collagen–silk
composite fibers.

In this work, we aim to evaluate the effect
of GA vapor treatment
on the mechanical properties, stability and biocompatibility of E-spun
collagen–silk composite fibers. The study is focused on composite
fibers with 30% silk (CS30) due to their superior physical and biological
properties as a cell culture matrix,16 with
pure collagen and pure silk fibers as controls to delineate the mechanism
of the treatment effects. The relationship between the effect and
the extent of GA treatment has been examined by varying the treatment
time while maintaining the concentration of GA at 20% and the temperature
at 25 °C. The systematic study provides the guideline to effectively
tune the properties of fibers with suitable protein compositions by
a simple GA treatment to achieve desirable matrices for various applications.

Results
Effect
of GA Treatment on Fiber Morphology and Fluorescence
GA vapor
treatment turned the white and fluffy E-spun fiber matrices
into brown and firm materials (Figure S1). In this process, the GA vapor treatment induced changes in the
fiber dimension and fiber morphology. The treatment time-dependent
changes of CS30 fibers are shown in Figure 1. As illustrated in the large-scale optical
images (Figure 1A–C),
the fibers are largely parallel and densely aligned. The AFM images
(insets) show that with no or 6 h of GA treatment, the fibers are
cylindrical and smooth and are uniform along the fiber axis. Extended
GA treatment (48 h) caused a roughly 8% decrease in the fiber width
and frequent coalescence of adjacent or joint fibers (circled region
in Figure 1C, inset).
Similar changes were more frequently observed on pure collagen fibers
but rarely observed on pure silk fibers. It suggests that overtreatment
has a greater impact on collagen than on silk. This is evidenced by
the 13.6 and 3.8% decrease in the fiber width of pure collagen and
pure silk, respectively, after 48 h of GA treatment (Figure 1H). The percentage of fiber
weight change after the 48 h GA treatment was also monitored to evaluate
the amount of GA molecules incorporated into different types of fibers.
As shown in Figure 1G, light GA treatment (2 and 6 h) caused less than 1.0% change for
all fiber types. A 48 h GA vapor treatment led to the weight gain
by 12.1, 6.5, and 3.2% for collagen, CS30, and silk fibers, respectively.
Thus, collagen-rich fibers can uptake a significantly larger amount
of GA after extensive GA treatment.

Fiber widths were measured from AFM images. Error bars indicate standard
errors.

As-spun CS30 fibers displayed
weak fluorescence, which is attributed
to the autofluorescence of collagen.16 Stronger
green fluorescence was observed after the fibers were treated with
GA vapor, and the fluorescence intensity increased with the GA treatment
time (Figure 1D–F).
The same trend of changes was observed in pure collagen but not in
pure silk. Thus, we premise that the enhanced fluorescence is due
to a higher level of cross-linking in the collagen component of composite
fibers. This was corroborated by the increased fluorescence intensity
of the 520–560 nm band in the fluorescence spectra of collagen
fibers with increased GA treatment time (Figure S2). We ascribe the increased fluorescence to the formation
of a Schiff base (C=N) between the collagen and polymerized
GA molecules,36 as well as the increased
fiber stiffness, which restricts intramolecular rotation leading to
the enhancement of fluorescence emission.37 This is consistent with the results from Fourier transform infrared
(FTIR) spectroscopic analysis, free amine quantification, and measurements
of fiber mechanics (see below).

Degree of GA Cross-linking
in Different Types of Fibers
GA cross links proteins through
its aldehyde groups’ reaction
with primary amines to form the Schiff base.38,39,36,40 The degree
of GA cross-linking was determined by the decrease of the number of
free amine groups evaluated by a 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid
(TNBS) assay. As shown in Figure 2, before GA treatment, collagen, CS30, and silk fibers
had a free amine group content of 33, 24, and 7 per 1000 amino acids,
respectively. According to the amino acid sequences, collagen has
about 38 free amines per 1000 amino acids, counting lysine and hydroxylysine
as well as the terminal amines. This is in good agreement with the
result of the TNBS assay. Synthetic silk protein has free amines at
the terminals only.41 On the basis of the
protein size, in theory, there are approximately 2 free amines per
1000 amino acids. The descrepancy between the theoretical and experimental
data is likely due to the fact that the goat-derived silk proteins
are often truncated into smaller peptide pieces during purifications,26 leading to a greater number of free amines per
1000 amino acids. The derived free amine abundance for CS30 (27 per
1000 amino acids) agrees well with the experimental data. Figure 2 shows that the number
of free amines in collagen and CS30 decreased dramatically in the
first 12 h of GA treatment and then plateaued at less than 7 per 1000
amino acids afterward. The silk protein has much fewer free amine
groups. As a result, the free amine content of silk dropped slightly
from 7 to 4 per 1000 amino acids even after 48 h of treatment. Thus,
the Schiff base formation reaction, induced by GA cross-linking, is
more prominent in collagen and CS30 than that in silk. The degree
of cross-linking directly affects fiber mechanics, stability, and
degradability.

of GA
treatment time by a TNBS assay. Comparison is made between CS30, collagen
(C), and silk (S) fibers. Data were summarized from three trials.
Error bars indicate standard errors.

Effect of GA Treatment on Fiber Mechanics
The mechanical
properties of E-spun fibers were characterized by stress–strain
tests. As shown in Figure 3A, untreated collagen, silk, and composite fibers responded
differently when subjected to stretching along the fiber direction.
Compared with collagen fibers, silk fibers can sustain remarkably
higher tensile stress with greater Young’s modulus; however,
they break abruptly upon extension. Consistent with our previous results,16 both the ultimate tensile strength and Young’s
modulus increase monotonically with the percentage of silk in the
collagen–silk composite fibers, whereas the ultimate strain
increases with the percentage of collagen in the fibers. Thus, silk-rich
fibers have higher tensile strength, whereas collagen-rich fibers
are more stretchable. Fiber toughness was evaluated by the integral
of the stress–strain curves. As shown in the inset of Figure 3A, fiber toughness
is optimized at 6.57 MJ/m3 in CS30 composite fibers. Thus,
CS30 is superior to both the pure materials in fiber mechanics.

Figure 3 Variation of
fiber mechanics with GA treatment time for collagen
(C), CS30, CS60, and silk (S) fibers. (A) Typical stress–strain
curves of untreated fibers. The inset illustrates the variation of
fiber toughness with silk percentage in the fibers. (B–E) Variation
of the ultimate tensile strength (B), ultimate tensile strain (C),
Young’s modulus (D), and toughness (E) of the fibers with GA
treatment time.

The effect of GA treatment
on fiber mechanical properties is shown
in Figure 3B–E.
Short-term treatments (<6 h) led to marked increase in ultimate
tensile strength, strain, Young’s modulus, and fiber toughness
for all types of fibers. In addition, the GA treatment prompted a
greater increase in ultimate tensile strength and Young’s modulus
in silk-rich fibers and a greater increase in fiber strain in collagen-rich
fibers. Longer-term GA treatments induced decreases in the properties
of all types of fibers, particularly in ultimate stress and strain.
As a result, the toughness of collagen, CS30, and silk fibers reached
the highest values at 6 h of treatment, with CS30 being the strongest
(27.1 MJ/m3). CS60 fibers reached the highest toughness
of 25.6 MJ/m3 at 12 h of treatment.

GA Treatment-Induced Protein
Structural Changes
The
enhanced fiber mechanics by GA treatment suggests that GA interacts
with collagen and silk strongly and distinctively. The secondary structure
of the protein is directly relevant to fiber mechanics.42 The change of the protein secondary structure
was monitored by FTIR spectra at the amide I and amide II regions.
As shown in Figure 4A, the amide I band of pure collagen fibers is centered at 1655 cm–1, characteristic for the α helices dominant
in collagen.49 The peak remains unchanged
in position and relative intensity at different times of the GA treatment,
suggesting that GA treatment has a negligible effect on the secondary
structure of collagen. With the increase of the GA treatment time,
a gradual increase of the peak at 1588 cm–1 was
observed in collagen-rich fibers (C and CS30), coinciding with the
increase of fiber fluorescence (Figure 1D–F). The peak is negligible in the spectra
of silk with or without GA treatment. It is assigned to the C=N
bond of the Schiff base formed from the reaction between the aldehyde
groups of GA and the primary amine groups of proteins.36 A peak at 1720 cm–1 was also
seen to increase with the GA treatment time in all types of fibers.
The peak is present in the spectrum of GA and is assigned to C=O
stretching in aldehydes.43 Although the
intensity of both 1588 and 1720 cm–1 peaks increases
with the GA treatment time, the increase is more dramatic after longer
treatment times. It suggests the presence of excessive GA molecules,
which likely leads to further GA polymerization due to aldol condensation
reactions. The marked increase of the two peaks in collagen over silk
is consistent with the observation that collagen uptakes more GA molecules
than silk after long-term GA treatment.

Figure 4 (A) FTIR spectra of E-spun
collagen (C), CS30, CS60, and silk (S)
fibers in the amide I and amide II region (1485–1750 cm–1), collected at various GA treatment times. Blue arrows
highlight the changes of the designated peaks with GA treatment time.
(B) Variation of the β-sheet to helix/coil ratio of the silk
content in the E-spun fibers with GA treatment time. The ratios were
calculated by quantitative analysis of signature peaks derived from
peak deconvolution of the amide I band (see Figure S3).

In pure silk, the peaks
centered at 1655 and 1540 cm–1 in Figure 4A are
assigned to amide I and amide II, respectively, which are characteristic
for helices and random coils.13 After GA
treatment, shoulder peaks appeared at 1630 and 1528 cm–1, and the intensity increased with the GA treatment time (Figure S3). They are signature peaks for β-sheets
in silk proteins.32,44 It suggests that the treatment
induced a secondary structural transition from helical or coiled conformation
to β-sheets. The transition was quantitatively analyzed by peak
deconvolution of the amide I band (see Figure S4) following the method established by Yu et al.45−47 The amide I band was chosen because it is particularly sensitive
to the protein secondary structure, whereas the amide II band involves
complex vibrations of multiple groups.45 After peak fitting, integrals of the 1655 and 1630 cm–1 peaks were used to quantify the degree of helix/coil to β-sheet
transition as illustrated in Figure 4B. In the absence of GA treatment, silk proteins in
all types of fibers show a β-sheet to coil ratio of around 0.4,
implying the dominant helical or coiled structures in the protein
polypeptides. This ratio markedly increases to above 0.7 after 2 h
of treatment, continuously rises to 0.8 after 6 h of treatment, and
plateaus at 0.9 after longer treatment times. Thus, a short-term GA
treatment is adequate to induce an effective secondary structural
transition in silk.

Effect of GA Treatment on Fiber Stability
A tissue
engineering scaffold is expected to be stable to support the cell
culture over a period of time. We examined the morphological changes
of fibers after they were immersed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)
for 2 days under cell culture conditions. As shown in the AFM images
in Figure 5, without
GA treatment, collagen and CS30 fibers became flat and sometimes curled
and swelled dramatically along with the appearance of rough and irregular
surface features, indicating severe fiber deterioration. Coinciding
with the morphological changes, Young’s modulus reduced by
78% for collagen fibers and 60% for CS30 fibers (measured by an AFM
nanoindentation method, data not shown). With the 6 h GA treatment,
however, both collagen and CS30 fibers preserved the fiber morphology
and elasticity even after 2 days of incubation in PBS. Silk fibers,
regardless of the GA treatment, showed negligible changes in fiber
morphology and mechanics under the same conditions, demonstrating
remarkable stability.

images of
collagen, CS30, and silk fibers after they were immersed in PBS for
two days. (A–C) Untreated fibers; (D–F) fibers with

swelling ratio with GA treatment time for collagen (C), silk (S),
and CS30 fibers. (H) Variation of the weight loss ratio with GA treatment
time to evaluate the level of protein dissolution. For G and H, fibers
were immersed in DI water for 2 h before the measurements.

The morphological instability of collagen and CS30
fibers is likely
relevant to water uptake. To quantify the effect of GA treatment on
water uptake, the swelling ratio of fibers with GA treatment time
was measured after the fibers were immersed in DI water for 2 h. As
shown in Figure 5G,
untreated collagen fibers can uptake a significantly higher amount
of water (a swelling ratio of 561%) than CS30 (172%) and silk (88%)
fibers. With the increase of the GA treatment time, the swelling ratio
of collagen dropped exponentially and reached 36% after the 24 h treatment.
The GA treatment also impacted silk fibers, causing the swelling ratio
to decrease to 24% after only 2 h of treatment. A longer treatment
time induced negligible changes. Although collagen is dominant in
CS30 fibers, CS30 fibers uptake much less water than collagen, and
a 6 h GA treatment effectively reduced the swelling ratio to 27%.

A large amount of water uptake by the fibers can cause protein
dissolution, leading to weight loss and structural defects of the
fibers and hence a decrease in fiber mechanics. By comparing the dry
weight of each sample before and after the 2 h incubation in water,
the percentage of weight loss was calculated, and its change with
GA treatment time is shown in Figure 5H. The weight loss of untreated collagen, CS30, and
silk fibers was 22.1, 12.2, and 7.2%, respectively. The values dropped
rapidly within 6 h of GA treatment for all types of fibers and plateaued
after 12 h of treatment. The result suggests that the fibers became
more resistant to water dissolution after GA treatment.

Taken
together, GA treatment reduced water uptake by the fibers
and hence reduced the protein dissolution, leading to more stable
fibers. We found that CS30 fibers with a 6–12 h GA treatment
remained stable for up to 7 days in an aqueous environment; thus,
they are suitable candidates as scaffolds to support in vitro cell
culture.

Biocompatibility of GA-Treated Fibers
To examine the
biocompatibility of the fibrous matrices, we cultured cells on collagen,
CS30, and silk fibers with various GA treatment times. Human decidua
parietalis placental stem cells (hdpPSCs) were chosen in the study
due to their relatively short doubling time and sensitive responses
to matrix properties according to our previous studies.8,16,48Figure 6 shows optical images of the cells after
a 1-day culture on the matrices. Cells on the 0 and 6 h GA-treated
collagen and CS30 fibers were shown to tightly adhere to and were
well polarized along the fibers with high length-to-width ratios.
However, cells on the 48 h GA-treated fibers were less polarized,
and many were round. Cells were much less polarized and more cells
were round or polygonal on silk fibers regardless of the GA treatment
time. The less polarized morphology of cells on silk fibers and on
overly treated collagen and CS30 fibers infers a weaker cell–fiber
interaction.

Figure 6 Optical images of hdpPSCs grown on collagen, CS30, and
silk fiber
matrices with 0, 6, and 48 h GA treatments. Images were taken at day
1 postplating. Bar size: 100 μm.

The strength of cell adhesion on various fiber matrices was
evaluated
by a trypsin deadhesion assay at 12 h postplating, with a glass substrate
as a control. A longer deadhesion time implies a stronger cell–matrix
adhesion. As shown in Figure 7A, with the increase of the collagen percentage in composite
fibers, the cell adhesion is stronger. This is consistent with the
fact that collagen promotes cell adhesion with its integrin-binding
sites, whereas silk proteins do not have a specific motif binding
to the cell surface proteins. The 6 h GA treatment slightly improved
or retained cell adhesion on the fibers; however, the 48 h treatment
reduced cell adhesion on all types of fibers likely due to the denatured,
rigid, and stiff fibers induced by the overtreatment (see Figure 3). The result suggests
that lightly treated collagen and CS30 fibers are favorable for cell
attachment.

of various fiber matrices. (A) Cell–matrix adhesion characterized
by the trypsin deadhesion time constant (t0.5) at 12 h postplating of cells on fibers with 0, 6, and 48 h GA treatments.
(B) Profiles of cell proliferation on collagen, CS30, and silk fibers
at various GA treatment times, characterized by the MTS assay for
cells at days 1, 4, and 7 postplating. (C) Cell viability examined
by the MTS assay for cells on fiber-loaded Petri dishes after a 1-day
culture.

Cell proliferation profiles on
various matrices were examined by
the MTS assay. As shown in Figure 7B, cells on all types of fibers proliferated rapidly.
The proliferation rate slightly decreased with the increase of the
GA treatment time (Figure S5), and the
doubling time ranged from 3.1 days for untreated fibers to 3.5 days
for fibers with 48 h of treatment. At day 1 postplating, the number
of cells on untreated collagen and CS30 fibers was similar but was
27% higher than that on silk fibers. The cell number barely changed
with the less than 6 h GA treatment but decreased noticeably on collagen
and CS30 fibers with longer-term treatment (e.g., a decrease of 35%
on collagen and 31% on CS30 after the 48 h treatment). The difference
is due to the distinction in the strength of cell–matrix adhesion
among the fibers (Figure 7A), leading to the difference in initial cell attachment.
The cell viability test revealed no significant difference on fibers
with different compositions and GA treatment times (Figure 7C). Even on overly treated
fibers, the overall cell viability was above 94%. Presumably, glycine
and 70% ethanol rinsing after the GA treatment effectively quenched
the toxic residuals of GA and sterilized the fibers. Note that this
process had a negligible effect on the fiber structure and fiber mechanics
according to our AFM analysis. The results suggest that although the
fibers differ in cell adhesion, they all adequately support cell culture.

As a tissue engineering scaffold, the fibers must be degradable.
The degradability of the fibers was examined by an in vitro collagenase
degradation assay. As shown in Figure 8A, the susceptibility of CS30 fibers to collagenase
digestion was characterized by the decrease in the remaining weight
of the fibers with the digestion time. Apparently, degradation of
untreated fibers is much faster than that of GA-treated fibers. After
24 h of enzyme digestion, the remaining weight ratio of CS30 fibers
with 2, 6, and 48 h of GA treatments was 0.202, 0.635, and 0.888,
respectively, whereas the untreated fibers were completely degraded.
Fibers with 48 h of treatment showed high resistance against enzyme
degradation. The degradability of collagen, CS30 and, silk fibers
is compared in Figure 8B after 2 h of enzyme digestion. The weight loss of silk fibers was
less than 10% regardless of the GA treatment time. On the contrary,
collagen and CS30 fibers were readily degraded, and the degradation
was hampered by GA treatment in a time-dependent manner. Therefore,
by adjusting the fiber composition and the GA treatment time, scaffolds
with desirable degradability can be achieved.

degradation by the change of the remaining
weight ratio of fibers. (A) Comparison of the degradation kinetics
of CS30 fibers at different GA treatment times. (B) Comparison of
fiber degradation with GA treatment time in collagen (C), CS30, and

the measurement.

Discussion
In
this work, we demonstrated that a short-term GA treatment can
not only enhance the mechanical properties and stability of E-spun
collagen–silk composite fibers but also impose controls on
fiber degradability while the fibers retain biocompatibility. Thus,
the treated fibers are excellent candidates to be employed as tissue
engineering scaffolds.

Owing to the distinctive structures of
collagen and silk proteins,
GA treatment affects the fibers differently. GA cross links collagen
peptides through reactions of the aldehyde groups of GA with the free
amine groups of lysine or hydroxylysine residues of the polypeptide
chains to form Schiff base structures.38,39 This was confirmed
by the dramatic decrease of the free amine groups with GA treatment
time (Figure 2), as
well as the increase of the IR peak at 1588 cm–1, which indicates the formation of a Schiff base (Figure 4A). It was also evidenced by
the increased fiber fluorescence, which is attributed to the formation
of the Schiff base as well as the increased fiber stiffness that restricts
intramolecular rotation of the fluorophores, leading to the enhancement
of emission.37 Native collagen is made
up of strands of triple α helices. The FTIR spectroscopic analysis
suggests that the α helix is the dominant structure in as-spun
collagen fibers, consistent with the GXY repeating sequences in collagen
peptides. By electrospinning, the molecules were aligned preferentially
in the axial direction;49,50 however, they were
loosely packed. GA treatment generated cross-links via intra- and
inter-molecular covalent bonds that bundled peptides within the E-spun
fibers together, evidenced by the reduced fiber width, to produce
more closely stacked structures resembling that of native collagen
fibers.21 The cross-links restrain the
slippage between molecules, rendering a strong resistance against
uniaxial stretching along the fibers.35 Thus, GA treatment augmented the ultimate strain of collagen fibers
most significantly, while also increasing the ultimate tensile strength,
ultimate stress, and Young’s modulus. Although GA treatment
effectively tightened the collagen peptides in fibers, the secondary
structure was largely unaffected, evidenced by the FTIR spectra.

Unlike collagen, dragline silk proteins do not have lysine or hydroxylysine
residues, and they are relatively hydrophobic. The glycine-rich regions
(GGX or GPGXX motifs) likely form coiled structures, and the polyalanine
regions, if arranged properly, form β-sheet structures. The
FTIR spectrum of the as-spun silk fibers implies a random coil dominant
structure, indicating the improper folding of the silk proteins. The
GA vapor induced the internal transition of the secondary structure
of silk proteins from random coils to ordered β-sheets,32,33 proved by the quantitative analysis of the amide I band in the FTIR
spectra (Figure 4).
It has been reported that a low pH can induce a conformational change
of silk proteins from a disordered spidroin into the β-sheet
rich structures.51 The GA vapor created
a mildly acidic environment. In addition, GA acted as a polymer plasticizer
and generated a local hydrophilic environment, which may drive the
hydrophobic polyalanine to fold–unfold and to stack into β-sheet
domains.46 In native dragline silk, crystalline
β-sheet domains of alanine-rich motifs are responsible for the
exceptionally high tensile strength of silk. Posttreatment methods
of artificial silk fibers, such as mechanical stretching in ethanol/water
bath, water vapor annealing, and acid/cation treatment, have been
applied to induce β-sheet formation to enhance the strength
of the fibers.24,26−28,51 The GA vapor treatment in this study provides an
alternative simple and mild treatment method to elevate β-sheet
formation and hence greatly improve the tensile strength and Young’s
modulus of the silk fibers.

In as-spun composite fibers (e.g.,
CS30), the glycine-rich regions
of silk protein (relatively hydrophilic) likely complex with the GXY
motifs of collagen via hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interaction,
leaving the hydrophobic polyalanine regions of the silk protein relatively
free. When GA treatment was applied, due to the hydrophobic nature
and the lack of free amines of the polyalanine motifs, we infer that
the cross-linking reactions predominantly occurred at the integrated
regions of collagen and silk, and their helix and coil structures
were largely retained. Such reinforced interactions between biopolymers
can effectively reduce the space between neighboring molecules and
hence effectively prevent water uptake and protein dissolution (Figure 1G,H), yielding increased
fiber stability,23 which is essential for
the fibers to provide consistent biophysical and biochemical cues
to support cellular behaviors. However, GA treatment can lead to the
diffusion of small GA molecules to the polyalanine region of the silk
protein, driving the conformational change of polyalanine from random
coils to β-sheet domains. Thus, the dual effects of GA treatment
on collagen and silk are augmented in the composite fibers to make
a profound impact on reinforcing fiber strength, strain, and elasticity52 to achieve resistance to both fracture and rupture.
The fibers were also shown to adequately support cell adhesion and
proliferation and can be degraded by enzymes in a controllable manner.
Thus, the GA-treated CS30 fiber is an excellent candidate of tissue
engineering scaffolds.

Nevertheless, a longer-term (>12 h)
GA treatment is undesirable.
Our data in Figure 3 have shown that a long-term GA treatment induced a marked decrease
in the strain of collagen fibers and a noticeable decrease in the
tensile strength of silk fibers, leading to corresponding changes
in CS30 fibers and, consequently, a decrease in the fiber toughness. Figures 1G, 2, and 4 collectively indicate that
a long-term GA treatment resulted in an excess of GA molecules deposited
on the fibers. Collagen can uptake more GA molecules than silk because
of its hydrophilic nature. These molecules may self-react to form
unsaturated polymers53 in the fiber matrix
and generate overly cross-linked fibers to impede the free extension
of the molecules leading to reduced fiber strain. Excessive GA molecules
may also fill up the free space in silk fibers, creating steric hindrance
to prevent an effective random coil to β-sheet transition and
lead to a reduced fiber tensile strength. In contrast, initial GA
cross-linking involves one GA binding with two free amine groups.
When the amine groups are abundant in the fibers (short-term treatment),
the binding is local and quick, and the effect is immediate. Over
a long-term treatment, the free amine groups become fewer and the
GA molecules become excessive. In this case, the amine groups are
farther apart on average, and cross-linking is achieved by extending
the chain via GA polymerization. The GA polymer network formed over
time prevents the penetration of GA molecules to further enhance the
fiber mechanics. This is consistent with the observation that GA treatment
in the initial six hours greatly affected the fiber properties; however,
most effects were alleviated with long-term treatment. The study of
cell adhesion (Figure 7A) suggests that a long-term GA treatment reduced cell adhesion.
This is likely due to GA polymerization, which shades the integrin-binding
site on collagen and reduces the cell–matrix interaction. The
increased fiber stiffness by a long-term GA treatment may also contribute
to the decreased cell–matrix interaction. Despite the decrease
in the number of initially attached cells, cell viability and proliferation
were barely affected even with long-term GA treatment. Importantly,
GA treatment was shown to reduce the degradation rate of the collagen–silk
composite fibers. Thus, GA vapor treatment provides a simple, mild,
yet effective way to fine-tune the mechanics, stability, and degradability
of fibers with a desirable composition serving for a designated biological
function.

Although the GA vapor treatment is proven to be an
effective approach
to rectify the E-spun composite fibers, many other posttreatment methods,
such as additional physical or chemical cross-linking techniques to
stabilize collagen, water bath stretching, and alcohol vapor treatment
to enhance the mechanical properties of silk, are yet to be explored.
Ultimately, systematic studies are expected to reveal the mechanisms
of the treatment effects and guide us to tailor a method, likely a
combination of the methods and many others yet to be discovered, to
achieve optimal performance of the biocompatible scaffolds with appropriate
remodeling characteristics and mechanical properties.

Conclusions
Our study has shown that the GA vapor treatment greatly impacts
the E-spun collagen–silk composite fibers. GA chemically links
collagen peptides through reactions between its aldehyde groups and
free amino groups of lysine or hydroxylysine residues. It also induces
the enrichment of the β-sheet character in silk. Consequently,
a short-term treatment significantly enhanced the tensile strength,
elasticity, stretchability, and stability of the fibers, whereas overtreatment
caused the plasticity and fragility as well as reduced cell–matrix
adhesion. A 6 h GA vapor treatment of CS30 fibers was shown to lead
to an optimal balance of physical properties and biocompatibility.
The time-dependent effect of GA treatment offers an exceptional way
to conveniently tune the properties of E-spun fibers without changing
its protein compositions.

Freestanding tissue engineering scaffolds
are highly desirable
for in vitro and in vivo applications. They are required to be sufficiently
flexible, tough, stable, and biocompatible for effortless handling
and for adequately supporting cell development. The systematic study
of the effects of the GA vapor treatment provides a deeper understanding
of the treatment mechanisms and makes it possible to control the topographic
features, mechanical properties, stability, cell adhesion, and biodegradation
rates of E-spun collagen–silk fibers by adjusting only the
posttreatment protocols for versatile applications.

Experimental
Section
Materials
Collagen type I from calf skin was purchased
from MP Biomedicals (Solon, OH). Major ampullate spidroin proteins
1 and 2 (MaSp 1 and MaSp 2) of dragline spider silk were purified
from the milk of transgenic goats and mixed at a MaSp 1/MaSp 2 ratio
of 4:1 to obtain optimized mechanical properties.25,41 Collagen and silk proteins were dissolved in 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoro-2-propanol
(HFIP) (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA) separately. The collagen
and silk proteins were mixed to make solutions containing silk at
0% (pure collagen), 30% (CS30), 60% (CS60), and 100% (pure silk) while
the total protein concentration was maintained at 80 mg/mL. GA (Fisher
Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA) was diluted to 20% v/v in water, and its
vapor was used for E-spun fiber posttreatment.

Preparation of Collagen–Silk
Composite Fibers
Aligned freestanding collagen–silk
composite fibers were prepared
using a home-built electrospinning system, as described in the previous
work.16 The spinning conditions were optimized
to obtain fibers with a desired dimension, density, and alignment.
The parameters are summarized in Table S1.

The as-spun fibers were dried in a vacuum oven at 30 °C
for 24 h to remove any solvent (HFIP) residue and then exposed to
water vapor overnight as a calibration of all fibers before any test
or treatment. GA treatment was carried out by exposing the fibers
to the vapor of 20% (v/v) GA at room temperature for 0, 2, 6, 12,
24, 48, or 96 h. Fibers for cell culture were immersed in a 0.1 M
glycine aqueous solution for 1 h to abate the toxicity of residue
aldehyde groups to cells, followed by sterilization using 70% (v/v)
ethanol and overnight UV exposure.

Atomic Force Microscopic
Imaging and Optical Imaging
Fiber morphology was characterized
by using a multimode Nanoscope
IIIa atomic force microscope (AFM; Veeco Metrology, Santa Barbara,
CA) equipped with a J-scanner. The fiber width was analyzed using
the NanoScope Analysis software. To examine fiber stability in a cell
culture environment, the images were collected after the fibers with
various GA treatment times were immersed in 1× PBS buffer and
stored in the cell culture incubator (37 °C, 10% CO2) for 48 h.

A Nikon TE2000-U microscope was used to collect
optical images to examine the fiber alignment and cell growth on the
fibers. The effect of the GA treatment on fiber fluorescence was studied
using the same system at the excitation and emission wavelengths of
470 and 520 nm, respectively.

Fiber Weight Measurement
E-spun collagen, CS30, or
silk fibers (3–5 mg) before and after GA treatment were vacuum-dried
overnight at 37 °C and weighed using a thermogravimetric analyzer
(Mettler-Toledo, Columbus, OH) at a resolution of 0.001 mg to evaluate
the amount of GA uptake by various fibers.

To evaluate fiber
stability, the swelling ratio of fibers after incubation in water
was examined. In this case, the weight of each dry sample (W0) was measured before it was soaked in deionized
water at 37 °C for 2 h. After removing excess water, the weight
of each sample (W1) was measured. The
swelling ratio was calculated by (W1 – W0)/W0 × 100%.
To evaluate protein dissolution, the wet samples were dried in a vacuum
oven and weighed (W2). The weight loss
was calculated by (W0 – W2)/W0 × 100%.

Determination of Free Amine Group Content
The as-spun
fibers were subjected to a TNBS assay.54 In brief, the fibers were first immersed in 1 mL of 4% (wt) NaHCO3 solution for 2 h at room temperature. Then, 1 mL of freshly
prepared 0.1% (wt) TNBS in 4% (wt) NaHCO3 was added, and
the mixture was heated at 40 °C for 2 h. After 3 mL of 6 N HCl
was added, the solution was heated at 60 °C for 1.5 h, followed
by 3 min sonication and a further 1 h incubation to allow complete
dissolution of the fibers. After cooling down to room temperature,
the resulting solution was diluted to 10 mL to measure the absorbance
at 340 nm using a Beckman Coulter DU800 spectrophotometer (Brea, CA).
Control samples for each type of fibers were prepared by adding HCl
before the addition of TNBS. By generating a standard curve of absorbance
versus the number of free amine groups using glycine, the free amine
group content of the fibers was determined and presented as the number
of free amine groups per 1000 amino acids (n/1000).

Infrared Spectroscopy and Peak Deconvolution
Infrared
spectra of E-spun fibers were collected using a Thermo Nicolet Nexus
470 FTIR Spectrometer (Thermo Electron Co., Madison, WI). After treatment
and overnight drying in a vacuum desiccator, freestanding fibers,
prefixed on aluminum frames, were directly exposed to the IR beam
and scanned in the range of 400–4000 cm–1, with a nominal resolution of 4 cm–1. After linear
baseline correction of each spectrum, the absorbance of the amide
I band in the 1590–1710 cm–1 region was normalized
into the 0–1 scale. The normalized spectra were then subjected
to a peak deconvolution procedure using “peak analyzer”
of Origin Software (see details in the Supporting Information). The percentage of the integral of each fitting
peak was used to assess the proportion of the protein in the corresponding
configuration.

Mechanical Testing
Tensile stress–strain
curves
of E-spun fibers were obtained using an MTS Synergie 100 system (Test
Resources Inc., Shakopee, MN), as described in the previous work.16 In short, aligned freestanding fibers with various
GA treatment times were collected across an 8 mm gap of an aluminum
frame. Optical images (10×) were taken to estimate fiber density,
and the average cross-sectional area of individual fibers was determined
by AFM. The fibers were then tested at a stretching rate of 1 mm/min
and a data acquisition rate of 120 Hz to measure the ultimate stress,
ultimate strain, and Young’s modulus from the stress–strain
curves. Fiber toughness, the integral of the area beneath the stress–strain
curve, was calculated using the Origin software. The data were derived
from more than five measurements for each sample type.

Cell Proliferation
and Viability Tests
Undifferentiated
hdpPSCs were maintained in the phenol red-free RPMI-1640 medium (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA) supplemented with 0.1 mM sodium pyruvate, 100 U/mL penicillin–streptomycin
(Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), and 10% charcoalstripped fetal bovine
serum (S-FBS).8,55 E-spun fibers were collected
on 4 mm × 4 mm precleaned glass substrates. After the posttreatments
and sterilization, the fiber-loaded substrates were placed in the
wells of a 96-well plate with a flat bottom (Corning, Corning, NY).

In each well, 9.6 × 103 cells were seeded. To assure
that only cells on the fiber-loaded substrates were subject to the
test, the substrates with cells at days 1, 4, and 7 of culture were
transferred to a new 96-well plate before 120 μL of the medium
containing 20 μL of CellTiter 96 Aqueous One Solution Reagent
(Promega, Fitchburg, WI) was added to each well. After incubation
at 37 °C for 2 h, 100 μL of the solution from each well
was taken to measure the absorbance at 490 nm (ELx808 Absorbance Reader,
BioTek, VT) to examine the cell proliferation. Data were displayed
after subtracting the background absorbance generated by the cell
culture medium.

To evaluate the effect of the GA treatment on
cell viability, the
cells after a 1-day culture on the fiber-loaded Petri dishes were
subjected to a CellTiter 96 Aqueous Assay (Promega, Fitchburg, WI).
Absorbance of cells cultured on the Petri dish in the absence of fibers
was used as a control to derive the percentage of metabolically active
cells on various matrices.

Trypsin Deadhesion Assay
Cell adhesion
was examined
using a trypsin deadhesion assay, as previously described.16 Briefly, hdpPSCs after a 12 h culture were washed
with PBS and trypsinized. By taking in situ optical images (20×)
every 15 s, the reduction of the cell–substrate contact area
was monitored. The change of the area with time was plotted and fit
to the Boltzmann sigmoid equation to derive constant t0.5, which represents the time point when the area change
is 50% of the total area reduction, and is used to evaluate cell adhesion.56,57

In Vitro Biodegradation
Preweighed E-spun collagen,
CS30, and silk fibers (3–5 mg) were placed in 1.5 mL of centrifuge
tubes containing 1 mL of 100 unit/mL type I collagenase (Gibco, Big
Cabin, OK) in HBSS solution (Gibco, Big Cabin, OK) and incubated in
a shaker (37 °C, 120 rpm) for a specific period of digestion
time. The samples were then centrifuged (12 000 rpm, 3 min)
and washed with ultrapure water thrice before they were dried in a
vacuum oven (37 °C) and weighed again. The degree of fiber degradation
was presented by the ratio of the remaining dry weight (Wd) to the initial dry weight of E-spun fibers (W0), that is, Wd/W0.
