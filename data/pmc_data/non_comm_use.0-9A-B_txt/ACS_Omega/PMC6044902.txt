The preparation of
blue-emitting black phosphorus quantum dots
(BPQDs) is based on the liquid-phase exfoliation of bulk BP. We report
the synthesis of soluble BPQDs showing a strong visible blue-light
emission. Highly fluorescent (photoluminescence quantum yield of ≈5%
with the maximum emission (λmax) at ≈437 nm)
and dispersible BPQDs in various organic solvents are first prepared
by simple ultrasonication of BP crystals in chloroform in the ambient
atmosphere. Furthermore, simple mussel-inspired surface functionalization
of BPQDs with catechol-grafted poly(ethylene glycol) in basic buffer
afforded water-soluble blue-emitting BPQDs showing long-term fluorescence
stability, very low cytotoxicity, and excellent fluorescence live
cell imaging capability.

Introduction
Elemental nanomaterials
based on group IV elements such as carbon,1−3 silicon,4−6 and germanium7,8 have received significant
research interests owing to their unique properties applicable to
various promising applications. Graphene, a two-dimensional (2D) crystal
made of sp2-hybridized carbon atoms, has been widely investigated
owing to its fascinating optoelectrical and mechanochemical properties.9,10 Recently, another elemental nanomaterial based on phosphorus, a
group V element, has emerged as the new 2D layered material.11−17

Similar to graphene, phosphorene, a single layer or few layers
of black phosphorus (BP), has been isolated through the mechanical
exfoliation from bulk BP and has immediately received tremendous attention
owing to its remarkable optoelectronic performance.18,19 For example, phosphorene-based nanodevices have demonstrated the
drain current modulation and carrier mobility up to 105 and 1000 cm2/(V·s), respectively, showing the potential
of phosphorene as a new 2D material applicable in nanoelectronic devices.20,21 In addition, a few-layer phosphorene demonstrates direct and highly
layer-dependent photoluminescence (PL) through tuning band gaps from
mid-infrared to near-infrared wavelengths, showing promise for the
application in high-performance optoelectronic devices.22,23

Very recently, few studies have shown the facile preparation
of
soluble BP or phosphorene quantum dot (QD) by the liquid-phase exfoliation
of BP crystal, which is beneficial for the wider utilization of the
intriguing properties of phosphorene through various wet processes.24−26 Despite the recent rapid progress in the solution-based methods
of BP quantum dots (BPQDs), it is still a great challenge to prepare
soluble BPQDs with unexplored optical properties such as strong fluorescence
in the visible wavelength ranges and to explore the florescent BPQDs
in bioapplications such as physiologically nontoxic fluorescence bioimaging
agents.

In the present study, highly blue-emitting BPQDs with
photoluminescence
quantum yield (PLQY) of ≈5%, fluorescence stability, and long-term
dispersion in various organic solvents are first prepared by simple
ultrasonication of BP in chloroform in the ambient atmosphere. Furthermore,
the mussel-inspired surface functionalization and the subsequent solubility
switching of BPQDs were successfully performed with the utilization
of catechol-grafted poly(ethylene glycol) (CA-PEG) in basic buffer,
resulting in water-soluble and blue-emitting PEG-modified BPQD (PEG-BPQD)
showing both very low cytotoxicity and fluorescence cell imaging ability.

Results
and Discussion
Twenty-four organic solvents in various solvent
categories with
different surface tensions and molecular weights were tested toward
the liquid-phase exfoliation of BP flake (the Supporting Information (SI), Table S1). Ultrasonication was attempted to break down the van der Waals
interactions among the strong BP interlayers, similarly to the liquid-phase
exfoliation of graphite and boron nitride to prepare single- or few-layered
graphene and boron nitride nanosheets.27−30 To minimize the effects of other
experimental parameters such as temperature and humidity, all of the
liquid-phase exfoliation setups were attempted simultaneously using
a tip-sonicator attached with a 24 multitip accessory. After ultrasonication
for 1 h, nonexfoliated bigger BP particles were removed from the dispersion
of the BPQDs by centrifugation at either 2500 or 7500 rpm. Then, the
PL emission of each dispersion was examined by irradiation using a
hand-held ultraviolet lamp with 365 nm wavelength. Surprisingly, among
the 24 organic solvents, medium to strong blue emissions were observed
in N,N-dimethylacetamide (DMAc),
pyridine, and chloroform. The degree of exfoliation, identified by
monitoring the ultraviolet visible (UV–vis) spectrum of each
dispersion, did not sturdily correlate to the observation of the blue
emission. For example, alcoholic solvents such as methanol, ethanol,
isopropanol, and ethylene glycol did not show reasonable effectiveness
both for exfoliation and PL emission, whereas chloroform and pyridine
showed weak exfoliation performance but strong blue and green PL emission,
respectively. In the case of aprotic polar solvents, reported to be
a choice of organic solvents for the liquid-phase exfoliation of graphite
and even BP,31,32,24 blue emission was observed in DMAc, whereas N-methylpyrrolidone
(NMP) and N,N-dimethylformamide
(DMF) were only effective for the exfoliation itself.

In the
case of chloroform, the UV–vis spectrum of the chloroform
dispersion of the BPQDs showed three overlapped optical absorption
peaks at 247, 293, and 366 nm (5.03, 4.23, and 3.39 eV), respectively
(Figure 1a). The highest
PL emission intensity was observed for the BPQD dispersion in chloroform
at 437 nm with an excitation wavelength of 377 nm, and the position
of the maximum emission peak did not show any noticeable shift regardless
of the excitation wavelength (Figure S1). The strong PL emission peak between 400 and 550 nm is regarded
to be composed of three major peaks overlapping each other at 413,
437, and 463 nm (3.00, 2.84, and 2.68 eV), respectively. However,
the full width at half-maximum (FWHM) height of this emission peak
is as small as 60 nm, with an excitation wavelength of 377 nm. Even
though the FWHM of blue-emitting BPQDs is not close to the smallest
FWHM (≈20 nm) of Cd- or Pb-based inorganic QDs, it is much
smaller than the FWHM of carbon quantum dots (CQDs) or carbon dots
(CDs) (typically >100 nm) and silicon quantum dot (typically >70
nm).33−36 The photoluminescence excitation (PLE) spectra clearly demonstrate
that the observed overlapping luminescence peak centered at 437 nm
of the blue-emitting BPQDs could be correlated to the three new electronic
transitions at 364, 377, and 398 nm (3.41, 3.28, and 3.12 eV), respectively
(Figure 1b). The luminescence
decay profiles of the blue-emitting BPQDs dispersion prepared in chloroform
were recorded for the transitions at 413, 437, and 463 nm at the excitation
wavelength of 375 nm at room temperature by time-correlated single-photon
counting technique (Figure 1c). Regardless of the wavelength of the transition, the decay
profiles of the blue-emitting BPQDs very well fitted to the single-exponential
decays with the same lifetime (τ1) of 1.75 ns, indicating
that the blue emission from the BPQDs prepared in chloroform might
be originating from the band-edge states rather than the trap states,
which is also supported by the excitation-independent emission property
of the BPQDs.11

BPQDs. (b) PL and PLE spectra of the blue-emitting BPQDs. (c) The

UV emission at 352 nm is maximized at the excitation wavelength of

in various solvents.

In addition to the strong blue emission at 437 nm, the BPQDs
prepared
in chloroform showed an additional feature in their PL emission spectra.
First, the as-prepared BPQDs showed weak UV emission at 352 nm (3.52
eV) with a FWHM of 39 nm upon irradiation of UV ranging from 250 to
325 nm. The PLE spectrum shows that the UV emission at 352 nm is maximized
at the excitation wavelength of 300 nm (4.13 eV) (Figure 1d). Typically, the pristine
BP is known to be easily oxidized by the exposure to ambient atmosphere
within few hours.37−40 Therefore, significant oxidation of the prepared BPQDs is expected,
but24 the blue or UV emission of the BPQDs
prepared in chloroform did not show any noticeable decrease in the
emission intensity even after 1 month. The pristine BP layers are
reported to show a layer-dependent direct band gap ranging from ≈0.3
eV in bulk to >1 eV in monolayer.41−43 However, the absorption
and emission behaviors of the BPQDs in this study show that the BPQDs
prepared in chloroform has completely different electronic structures
compared to the previous reports, indicating that the BPQDs might
have different morphological or compositional features. The blue-emitting
BPQDs prepared in chloroform were highly dispersible in organic solvents,
including toluene and methanol, regardless of the polarity, but completely
insoluble in water (Figure 1e). No significant change in both the emission intensity and
maximum emission wavelength was observed. Mixing of the chloroform
dispersion of BPQD with water instantly induced the phase separation;
however, the bottom chloroform BPQD dispersion did not lose its PL
intensity even after several weeks, indicating the resistance of the
blue-emitting BPQDs for the hydrolysis or oxidation by excess water
and ambient oxygen.

Similarly, irradiation-independent PL emission
centered at 488
nm (2.54 eV) was observed when DMAc was used as the organic solvent
during the liquid-phase exfoliation of BP; however, the PL intensity
was much weaker than in the case of chloroform (the SI, Figure S2). Interestingly,
in pyridine, irradiation-dependent PL emission with maximum emission
wavelength ranging from 395 nm (325 nm excitation) to 442 nm (375
nm excitation) and further to 511 nm (450 nm excitation) was observed
similarly to the PL emission behavior of certain CQDs or CDs showing
tunable fluorescence emissions through the surface defect-derived
origins (the SI, Figure S3).44,45 Therefore, fluorescence emission
mechanism of the BPQDs prepared by the liquid-phase exfoliation of
BP is roughly estimated to originate from the band gap transitions
in the cases of chloroform and DMAc or the radiative recombination
of the surface-confined electrons and holes in the case of pyridine.

BPQDs prepared in chloroform were investigated by both the transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). The TEM
images show the BPQDs with an average size of 5.9 ± 4.4 nm after
checking 20 BPQD particles (Figure 2a). The high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) images of the BPQDs
indicate d-spacings of 0.21, 0.23, and 0.27 Å,
which were assigned to the (131), (141), and (040) planes, respectively,
consistent with the expected crystal structure of BP crystal (Figure 2b).46 The AFM topographic images of the exfoliated blue-emitting
BPQDs showed the presence of a range of shapes and sizes of the BPQDs.
The measured heights ranged from 4.6 to 6.2 nm, corresponding to the
BPQDs with approximately 8–12 layers (Figure 2c).24 The lateral
dimensions of these thin BPQD particles are relatively wider than
those observed by the TEM analysis, probably owing to the presence
of lateral aggregation of several BPQDs on a Si/SiO2 substrate
during the sample preparation. Raman spectroscopy was used to analyze
the few-layered BPQDs prepared by the liquid-phase exfoliation of
BP crystal in chloroform. The blue-emitting BPQDs showed characteristic
Raman peaks at 362.6, 440.0, and 467.0 cm–1, attributed
to one out-of-plane phonon mode (A1g) and two in-plane
modes (B2g and A2g), whereas the pristine BP
flake showed the corresponding Raman peaks at 363.8, 439.2, and 466.7
cm–1 (the SI, Figure S4).47 The
preservation of the Raman peak positions of BP in BPQD indicates that
the BPQDs retain the crystalline lattice of BP even after the liquid-phase
exfoliation in chloroform. Although there might be further oxidation
of BP layer(s) by atmospheric oxygen, the BPQD dispersion definitely
displayed unaffected blue emission regardless of the prolonged storage
in ambient atmosphere without special protection such as nitrogen
purging.

AFM topographic images and sectional view of BPQDs.

As BP flakes often present environmental instability
toward atmospheric
oxygen and water because of the easy oxidation or hydrolysis of the
pristine BP, the precise compositional features of the prepared BPQDs
should be investigated carefully to fully explore the fluorescent
BPQD dispersion as new nanomaterials for optoelectrical or biological
applications. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, X-ray
photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy
(EDX) analysis were performed for both the pristine BP and BPQD. The
FTIR spectrum of BPQD showed strong peaks at 1661, 1429, 1110, 1045,
and 878 cm–1 (Figure 3a). The peaks at 1661 and 1110 cm–1 are assigned to the P=O stretching and vibrational modes,
respectively, and the peaks at 1045 and 878 cm–1 are assigned to the P–O stretching modes. The pristine BP
also showed a very characteristic set of peaks at 3439, 1642, 1401,
1065, and 760 cm–1 in its FTIR spectrum. The peak
at 3439 cm–1 is attributed to the O–H stretching
mode, and the peak at 1642 cm–1 is assigned to the
P=O stretching mode.48 The broad
peak centered at ∼1065 cm–1 was ascribed
to the P–O stretching mode. The presence of those peaks in
BP supports the fact that the pristine BP is partially oxidized even
before solvent exfoliation by ambient moisture. However, the O–H
stretching peak of BP was not observed in BPQD, even though all of
the other peaks were observed, describing that certain chemical reaction
occurred during the liquid-phase exfoliation of BP in chloroform.
The most plausible explanation is that certain alkylation reaction
occurred, resulting in the formation of self-passivation layers on
the surface of BPQDs and the subsequent retardation of further oxidation
of BPQDs. As previously mentioned, the prepared BPQDs were easily
dispersible even in highly nonpolar organic solvents such as toluene
and hexane, but insoluble in water. Moreover, small peak(s) was observed
at ∼2916 cm–1 in the FTIR spectrum of BPQD,
which corresponds to the C–H stretching mode of the alkyl groups.
The hydrophobic nature of BPQDs facilitates the preparation of hydrophobic
polymer/BPQD composite films by simple mixing in common organic solvents.
Fluorescent polystyrene (PS)/BPQD composite film was simply prepared
by this approach (the SI, Figure S5). 2 wt % BPQD-included PS/BPQD composite film demonstrated
a strong blue fluorescence under UV irradiation. Fluorescence spectra
of the composite film retained the unique fluorescence profile of
pristine BPQDs (the SI, Figure S6). Excitation with 300 or 377 nm light resulted in
the maximum fluorescence intensities at 345 (UV emission) and 409/434.5
nm (blue emission), respectively, which closely match the fluorescence
behavior of BPQDs.

of BPs
and (c) high-resolution P 2p spectrum of the pristine BPs. (d) High-resolution
P 2p spectrum of BPQDs. (e) EDX mapping of the TEM image of the BPQDs.

All of the above results show
that BPQDs have significantly oxidized
phosphorous atoms in the forms of P–O–C probably near
the surface of the BPQD particles. The XPS survey of the BPQDs shows
binding peaks for P 2p and P 2s at 131.6 and 189.2 eV, respectively,
together with O 1s peak at 530.1 eV and C 1s peak at 283.1 eV (Figure 3b). The high-resolution
P 2p spectrum shows a peak in the high-energy region at 133.5 eV,
which again shows the high oxidation state (P–O) of the BPQDs,
and a small peak at 128.7 eV (P–P binding peak) (Figure 3d), whereas the pristine BP
shows a higher intensity for the P–P binding peak than that
of the P–O binding peak (Figure 3c). The EDX mapping of the TEM image of the BPQDs definitely
revealed significant P and O atoms in both the isolated or aggregated
BPQDs (Figure 3e).
In the TEM EDX mapping image, oxygen atoms were found to distribute
over the entire BPQD particles, and therefore a clear buildup of (R–O)x-P@P core–shell structure of the BPQDs,
where R is methyl, is not reasonable in this stage.29

All of the above experimental evidences clearly show
that BPQDs
have rich oxidized phosphorous atoms either on the surface or throughout
the BPQDs. If either P–OH or P=O–OH groups are
located at the edge of the BP layer of the BPQDs as dangling bonds,
exfoliated BPQDs should provide negative ζ potential values.
However, positive ζ potential values of more than +70 mV was
repeatedly observed for the chloroform dispersion of the BPQDs (the SI, Figure S7). The
insolubility of the BPQDs into aqueous media also correlates to this
observation because the presence of P–OH or P=O–OH
group should have enhanced the dispersion of BPQDs in aqueous media.
To obtain further detailed information on the surface functionalities
of BPQDs, phosphorus nuclear magnetic resonance (31P NMR)
spectroscopy was recorded for both the pristine BP flakes (solid NMR)
and BPQD dispersion in deuterated chloroform (CDCl3), with
85% phosphoric acid as the reference. The chemical shift of the reference
was 0 ppm (the SI, Figure S8). BPQD showed two distinct phosphorus peaks at −13.1
and −19.8 ppm, whereas the pristine BP showed a single peak
at 19.9 ppm.49 The distinct chemical shift
of phosphorous atoms in BPQD is regarded to originate from two factors.
One is nearly complete oxidation of P atoms in BPQD, and another is
the chemical reaction between chloroform and the P–O moieties
of BPQDs. We assumed that the alkylation of the P–O moieties
of BPs or BPQDs by chloroform, the solvent itself, during the liquid-phase
exfoliation step provides organo-soluble BPQDs. The 13C
NMR spectrum of BPQD also clearly shows the presence of carbon peaks
at 29.9 and 27.1 ppm, supporting the presence of (R–O)x–P moieties in BPQDs, where R is originating
from the alkyl group of chlorinated solvent, chloroform, in this study
(the SI, Figure S9). Further investigation is underway to fully understand the alkylation
reaction of BPs in halogenated organic solvents during sonication-assisted
exfoliation of BPs.

The blue emission of the BPQDs might be
beneficial for designing
BP-based nanomaterials as bioimaging agents. However, the as-formed
BPQDs cannot be utilized for the fluorescence bioimaging because BPQD
is completely insoluble in the aqueous media. Therefore, a facile
surface modification method of BPQDs is urgently required. Therefore,
mussel-inspired surface engineering of BPQDs was attempted by using
catechol-grafted hydrophilic polymer because the surface functionalization
proceeded by the catechol chemistry is widely acceptable on various
nanomaterials with different compositions and morphologies.50−52 At first, aqueous soluble catechol-grafted PEG (CA-PEG) was prepared
by the reaction between 2-chloro-3′,4′-dihydroxyacetophenone
(CCDP) and poly(N-isopropyl acrylamide)-grafted poly(ethylene
glycol) (PEG-g-PNIPAM) by the quaternization reaction
of CCDP on the nitrogen moieties of PNIPAM. The number of catechol
groups in single CA-PEG polymer was estimated as 15 from the 1H NMR spectrum of the prepared CA-PEG (the SI, Figure S10).53 At second, the mussel-inspired surface functionalization
of BPQDs with CA-PEG was attempted in a mixed solvent of EtOH and
tris-buffered silane (TBS, pH 9.0). After purification by centrifugation
and freeze drying, the PEG-modified BPQD (PEG-BPQD) was successfully
obtained with >90% yield. PEG-BPQDs were completely soluble in
aqueous
media and showed two characteristic n−π* and π–π*
transition peaks of CCDP at 257 and 360 nm, respectively, confirming
the mussel-inspired attachment of CA-PEG on BPQD (Figure 4a). Then, the PL spectra of
PEG-BPQDs were examined by increasing the excitation wavelength from
325 to 500 nm. Similar to the blue emission of the pristine BPQDs,
PEG-BPQDs showed blue PL emission centered at 428 nm under UV light
(365 nm). However, PEG-BPQDs presented irradiation-dependent PL emission
behavior in vivid contrast to the irradiation-independent PL emission
of pristine BPQDs (Figure 4b). Whereas the origin of dramatic change in the PL emission
behavior of BPQDs after the surface functionalization is not fully
understood in this stage, this excitation-dependent PL emission is
widely observed in CQDs or CDs. In the case of CQDs or CDs, single
molecular level PL study has shown that this excitation dependency
of PL emission originates from either the ensemble emission of CDs
showing different emission color54 or overlaid
emission of each CD having different fluorophores.55,56

with PEG-BPQDs (1 or 10 mg/mL, respectively).

The morphological features of PEG-BPQDs were examined by
TEM (the SI, Figure S11), AFM
(the SI, Figure S12), and dynamic light scattering (DLS) (the SI, Figure S13), respectively. The lateral
sizes of PEG-BPQDs were 40–60 and ∼78 nm in TEM and
DLS, respectively. The increased lateral size measured from the DLS
might originate from the solvated CA-PEG shells on the surface of
BPQDs. AFM showed the thickness of PEG-BPQDs ranging from 25 to 40
nm. From all of these characterizations, it is clear that PEG-BPQDs
have increased lateral size due to the presence of outer CA-PEG shells
on the BPQD cores. However, this core–shell image was not revealed
from the TEM or HRTEM analysis probably due to the similar electron
density both in polymeric shells and BPQD cores. The prepared PEG-BPQDs
showed a high dispersion stability in aqueous media and also in aqueous
buffer solution (PBS or FBS) under ambient condition. Negligible decrease
in fluorescence intensity less than 1% was observed with the exposure
by day light up to 14 days (the SI, Figure S14). QY of PEG-BPQDs in aqueous solution
was 4.4%, which is slightly smaller than the QY (∼5%) of pristine
BPQDs in chloroform. The facile dispersion of PEG-BPQDs in the aqueous
media together with the unique irradiation-dependent PL emission makes
PEG-BPQDs a useful multicolor fluorescence bioimaging agent. The in
vitro cell viability of PEG-BPQDs was investigated toward either MDCK
normal cells or KB tumor cells. Up to the concentration of 1 mg/mL
(1000 ppm), PEG-BPQD demonstrated a high cell viability of >91%
toward
both cells, indicating that PEG-BPQDs can be utilized as the less-toxic
fluorescence bioimaging agent (Figure 4c). The low toxicity of PEG-BPQDs might rely mainly
on the presence of biocompatible PEG segments on the surface of BPQDs.
Then, KB tumor cells were incubated in the presence of PEG-BPQD (1
or 10 mg/mL, respectively), and the cultured KB cells were investigated
by confocal laser scanning microscopy. Distinctly, the KB cells showed
the evident blue fluorescence at their corresponding excitation wavelengths,
indicating the facile cellular uptake and in vitro fluorescence cell
imaging performance of PEG-BPQD (Figure 4d).

Conclusions
In conclusion, we have
first demonstrated that stable blue-emitting
BPQDs can be prepared in chloroform by a simple sonication-assisted
liquid-phase exfoliation of BP flakes in the ambient atmosphere. The
prepared BPQDs were highly dispersible in organic solvents including
toluene and methanol, regardless of the polarity. Furthermore, simple
mussel-inspired surface functionalization of BPQDs with PEG afforded
water-soluble and blue-emitting PEG-BPQDs, showing very low cytotoxicity
together with excellent fluorescence cellular imaging capability.

Experimental
Section
Preparation of BPQDs
The preparation of soluble BPQDs
is based on the sonication-assisted liquid-phase exfoliation of bulk
BP crystal. The storage of BP crystal (flake form) has been totally
attempted inside the nitrogen-purged glovebox throughout the experiments
to minimize continual surface oxidation of pristine BPs. As a representative
example, 10 mg of BP was delivered out of glovebox and immediately
sonicated in 10 mL of chloroform by tip-sonicator in ambient atmosphere
using Q500 sonicator (500 W, Qsonica, LLC). To screen solvent effect
on the exfoliation of BPs, all of the liquid-phase exfoliation setups
were attempted simultaneously using a tip-sonicator attached with
a 24 multitip accessory to minimize the effects of other experimental
parameters such as temperature and humidity. The power amplitude of
sonicator was fixed at 80% and continuous 5 s on/10 s off operation
of sonicator was attempted to minimize the buildup of heat in the
dispersing media. After 1 h of sonication, nonexfoliated bigger BP
particles were removed from the dispersion of the BPQDs by centrifugation
at either 2500 or 7500 rpm, resulting in the synthesis of soluble
BPQDs showing a strong blue-light emission.

At first, aqueous-soluble
catechol-grafted PEG (CA-PEG) was prepared by the reaction between
2-chloro-3′,4′-dihydroxyacetophenone (CCDP) and poly(N-isopropyl acrylamide)-grafted poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG-g-PNIPAM) by the quaternization reaction of CCDP on the
nitrogen moieties of PNIPAM. The number of catechol groups in single
CA-PEG polymer was estimated as 15 from the 1H NMR spectrum
of the prepared CA-PEG.50 At second, the
mussel-inspired surface functionalization of BPQDs with CA-PEG was
attempted in a mixed solvent of EtOH and tris-buffered silane (TBS,
pH 9.0). After purification by centrifugation and freeze drying, the
PEG-modified BPQD (PEG-BPQD) was successfully obtained with >90%
yield.
PEG-BPQDs were completely soluble in aqueous media and showed two
characteristic n−π* and π–π* transition
peaks of CCDP at 257 and 360 nm, respectively, confirming the mussel-inspired
attachment of CA-PEG on BPQD.

Preparation of PEG-BPQDs
PEG (Mn of XXX, 0.4 ×
10–3 M), dimethyl acrylamide (DMA) (15 × 10–3 M), and NIPAAm (80 × 10–3 M)
were dissolved in 120 mL of anhydrous toluene and the initiator t-butylperoxybenzoate (1.0 × 10–3 M) was added to the solution to produce PEG-g-PNIPAM.
The mixture was then stirred for 24 h at 140 °C. The product
was purified by precipitation in hexane after rotary evaporation and
dried in a vacuum. To prepare CA-PEG through quaternization, PEG-g-PNIPAM (Mn 30 940 Da
measured by gel permeation chromatography, 0.1 × 10–3 M) and CCDP (1.5 × 10–3 M) were dissolved
in 50 mL of 1:1 ethanol in a 250 mL flask. The mixture was stirred
for 24 h at 70 °C. After stirring, the solvent was evaporated
in a rotary evaporator and precipitated using cold diethyl ether,
producing CA-PEG as white powders after vacuum drying. To synthesize
PEG-BPQDs, 0.2 g of CA-PEG and 4 mg of BPQD were dispersed in the
mixture solvent of 9 mL of ethanol and 1 mL of TBS buffer (pH 9.0).
After magnetic stirring for 24 h, centrifugation at 4000 rpm for 5
min produced blue-emitting supernatant and black precipitate. The
supernatant solution was collected and freeze-dried under reduced
pressure, producing PEG-BPQD powders with 93.7 wt % mass yield based
on the initial BPQD mass.

In Vitro Cell Viability of PEG-BPQD
The cytotoxicity
was measured using the [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide] MTT assay method. 200 mL of KB cells and MDCK cells, at a
density of 2 × 105 cells/mL, was placed in each well
of a 96-well plate and incubated for 24 h at 37 °C in a humidified
5% CO2 atmosphere. To determine the cellular viability,
a stock solution of PEG-BPQDs was dissolved in Roswell Park Memorial
Institute medium at a concentration of 1 mg/mL, and the stock solution
was diluted to 0.01 mg/mL. The medium was removed, and the cells were
treated with different concentrations of PEG-BPQDs. The cells were
then incubated for another 24 h. The medium containing PEG-BPQDs was
then replaced with 180 mL fresh medium and 20 mL of a stock solution
containing 15 mg of MTT in 3 mL PBS and incubated for another 4 h.
Finally, the medium was removed and 200 mL MTT solubilizing agent
was added to the cell and mixed thoroughly for 15 min. Absorbance
was measured at 570 nm wavelength using a microplate reader (Varioskan
Flash, Thermo Electron Corporation). The relative cell viability was
measured by comparing the control 96-well containing only the cell.

In Vitro Cell Imaging
The cellular uptakes of PEG-BPQDs
were analyzed using confocal imaging. The KB cells were plated over
a cover slide on an eight-well plate 200 mL at a density of 1 ×
105 cells/mL per well and incubated for 24 h at 37 °C
in a humidified 5% of CO2 atmosphere. The cells were then
treated with PEG-BPQDs at 1 or 10 mg/mL for 30 min in fresh culture
media, respectively. The cells were then washed with PBS several times
to remove the unbound PEG-BPQDs and then examined at 20× magnification
using an LSM510 confocal laser scanning microscope.

Characterization
UV–vis spectra were obtained
from the UV–vis spectrometer of Hewlett-Packard. PL spectra
were obtained from L550B luminescence spectrometer of Perkin-Elmer.
TEM and HRTEM images were recorded with FEI Tecnai T20 at an accelerating
voltage of 200 kV. AFM topographic images were obtained from XE-100
model of PSIA. FTIR spectra were obtained from Nicolet IR 200. XPS
data were obtained from Multilab 2000 of Thermo Scientific. Raman
spectra were obtained from LabRAM high-resolution dispersive Raman
microscope of Horiba Jobin Yvon using a 633 nm He–Ne laser
beam. The NMR spectra were recorded using an Avance digital 400 MHz
Bruker Spectrometer (Germany). ζ Potential measurements were
made with a Zetasizer ELS Z (Otsuka Electronics, South Korea). Confocal
fluorescent images were taken with a confocal laser microscopy system
(Confocal, LSM510, Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen 73447, Germany). The measurement
of QY of BPQDs and PEG-BPQDs was attempted by the reference point
method typically attempted for estimating QYs of other blue-emitting
fluorescent (nano)materials by a comparison with quinine sulfate (QY
of 0.54 in 0.1 M H2SO4).

Supporting Information Available

solvents in various solvent categories
with different surface tensions and molecular weights were tested
toward the liquid-phase exfoliation of BP flake (Table S1); highest
PL emission intensity was observed for the BPQD dispersion in chloroform
at 437 nm; irradiation-independent PL emission intensity was observed
when DMAc was used as the organic solvent during the liquid-phase
exfoliation of BP; irradiation-independent PL emission intensity was
observed when pyridine was observed similarly to the PL emission behavior
of certain CQDs or CDs; Raman spectroscopy characterization of four
different samples; digital photo images of PS and PS/BPQD composite
film (2 wt % BPQDs); fluorescence spectra of PS/BPQD composite film
(2 wt % BPQDs) with the excitation wavelength of 300 and 377 nm; positive
ζ potential was repeatedly observed for the chloroform dispersion
of the BPQDs; 31P NMR spectroscopy was recorded for both
the BPQD dispersion (blue line) and pristine BP (black line) measured
in CDCl3 with 85% phosphoric acid as the reference; 13C NMR spectrum of BPQD clearly shows carbon peaks at 29.9
and 27.1 ppm; 1H NMR spectrum of the prepared CA-PEG; TEM
image of PEG-BPQDs on carbon-coated Cu grid; AFM images of BPQDs on
Si wafer; size distribution profile of PEG-BPQDs (0.5 mg/mL in water)
measured by DLS; relative fluorescence intensity of PEG-BPQDs (1 mg/mL)
