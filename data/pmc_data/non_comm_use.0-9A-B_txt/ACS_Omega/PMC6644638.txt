In
this study, we report a single-step continuous production of
straight-chain liquid hydrocarbons from oleic acid and other fatty
acid derivatives of interest including castor oil, frying oil, and
palm oil using Mo, MgO, and Ni on Al2O3 as catalysts
in subcritical water. Straight-chain hydrocarbons were obtained via
decarboxylation and hydrogenation reactions with no added hydrogen.
Mo/Al2O3 catalyst was found to exhibit a higher
degree of decarboxylation (92%) and liquid yield (71%) compared to
the other two examined catalysts (MgO/Al2O3,
Ni/Al2O3) at the maximized conditions of 375
°C, 4 h of space time, and a volume ratio of 5:1 of water to
oleic acid. The obtained liquid product has a similar density (0.85
kg/m3 at 15.6 °C) and high heating value (44.7 MJ/kg)
as commercial fuels including kerosene (0.78–0.82 kg/m3 and 46.2 MJ/kg), jet fuel (0.78–0.84 kg/m3 and 43.5 MJ/kg), and diesel fuel (0.80–0.96 kg/m3 and 44.8 MJ/kg). The reaction conditions including temperature,
volume ratio of water-to-feed, and space time were maximized for the
Mo/Al2O3 catalyst. Characterization of the spent
catalysts showed that a significant amount of amorphous carbon deposited
on the catalyst could be removed by simple carbon burning in air with
the catalyst recycled and reused.

Introduction
Renewable resources
are of increasing interest to produce fuel
range hydrocarbons, especially liquid transportation fuels because
of the limited reserves of petroleum fuel. Fats & oil (which mainly
contain triglycerides and fatty acids) have been used as renewable
feedstocks for producing transportation fuels such as biodiesel1−4 or green diesel.5−8 Nonedible resources (jatropha oil, algae, waste cooking oil, animal
fats, tallow, etc.) are preferred as feedstocks over edible resources
to avoid the food versus fuel issue. However, higher oxygen content
and acidity of these feedstocks prevent them from being used directly
as fuel because of their corrosive properties and higher viscosity
compared to fossil fuels.9 To lower the
oxygen content, deoxygenation is an efficient upgrading pathway to
produce diesel range liquid hydrocarbons to minimize any issues related
to engine compatibility. Liquid hydrocarbon formed via the deoxygenation
process can obtain larger cetane numbers (85 to 99) compared to petroleum
diesel (45 to 55).10

Decarboxylation
is a cost-effective deoxygenation process for liquid
hydrocarbon production as it requires less/no hydrogen compared to
other processes such as hydrodeoxygenation. The decarboxylation process
requires a catalyst to produce higher yield/selectivity of liquid
hydrocarbons. Catalytic decarboxylation of lipid-based feedstocks
in water, that is, hydrothermal processing, is a promising pathway
for producing liquid hydrocarbons.6,8,11 Water has several unique properties at its subcritical
conditions (200–375 °C, 5–20 MPa), including a
lower dielectric constant, which enhances solubility of the lipid-based
feedstocks.12 The relatively large ionization
constant of subcritical water makes a highly reactive reaction media
by minimizing mass-transfer limitations.12 Water is also a good solvent for lipid feedstocks containing a large
moisture content (algal biomass, sewage sludge, or fish and animal
fat processing residues).13−15

Most catalytic processes
for decarboxylation have used noble metal
catalysts and high-pressure and external sources of hydrogen or carbon
dioxide to enhance the feedstock conversion and liquid product yield/selectivity.4,6,16−23 Yang et al.19 studied decarboxylation
of oleic acid (OA) using Pt/zeolite 5A and Pt/ZIF-67/zeolite 5A catalysts
in the presence of high-pressure (20 bar) hydrogen to obtain 98.7%
conversion of OA with 72.6 and 81.5% selectivity of heptadecane, respectively.
In the presence of a CO2 (20 bar) atmosphere, decarboxylation
of palmitic and lauric acids using this catalyst system gave 95% conversion
of both fatty acids with 91.7 and 93.5% selectivity of pentadecane
and undecane, respectively.18 Mäki-Arvela
et al.21 conducted tall oil fatty acid
deoxygenation using a Pd/C catalyst with 1% H2 balanced
with argon (17 bar) to enhance the selectivity and conversion of heptadecane.
The main shortcoming of noble metal catalysts is their limited availability
and high cost. Fu et al.8 and Hossain et
al.5,24 showed that hydrothermal decarboxylation
did not require external hydrogen, with the required hydrogen to saturate
the product being produced in situ by the water–gas shift reaction.
Water is well known to participate as a coreactant with CO in the
water–gas shift reaction under hydrothermal conditions, with
CO being produced via decarbonylation or thermal cracking of the fatty
acids.5,24

On the other hand, sulfided catalysts
(e.g., sulfided CoMo or NiMo
oxides) are also used for decarboxylation,25,26 which are comparatively cheaper than noble metal catalysts, but
leaching of sulfur may deactivate the catalytic activity and contaminate
the products, requiring an additional step for sulfur recovery.27,28 Besides the noble or sulfided catalysts, researchers reported non-sulfided
catalysts for decarboxylation. Morgan et al.29 reported the production of C5 to C17 hydrocarbons from triolein
and soybean oil using a nickel-supported catalyst. Wu et al.30 obtained over 80% selectivity of heptadecane
using a nickel-supported catalyst during stearic acid decarboxylation.
Na et al.31 reported more than 98% conversion
and less than 1 wt % of oxygen content in the product mixture during
decarboxylation of OA using a supported MgO catalyst. Content of hydrocarbon
(81.1%) and a low moisture content of biofuel from carinata oil were
reported by Zhao et al.32 using an Mo–Zn/Al2O3 catalyst. Most of these reported studies were
conducted in batch, whereas the reaction chemistry in continuous operation
(important for commercialization) is not well-known. Moreover, Hengst
et al.33 reported that acidic catalysts
are preferable for enhancing the decarboxylation chemistry. However,
they used noble metal (Pd) on different supports. In this study, we
introduced Mo as a low-cost acidic catalyst for decarboxylation for
the first time. For comparison purposes, Ni and MgO were used as reference
catalysts.

The scope of this work is toward the continuous hydrothermal
decarboxylation
of OA as a model compound, while also examining other fatty acid derivatives
including castor oil, frying oil, and palm oil. A current challenge
for the continuous decarboxylation process is to develop low-cost
stable catalysts. Moreover, the effect on the catalyst due to the
exposure of the harsh sub or near supercritical water is poorly reported.

Here, we synthesize molybdenum (Mo)-, MgO-, and Ni-loaded alumina
(γ-Al2O3) catalysts and investigate them
for OA decarboxylation. The best catalyst was chosen among these three
based on the degree of decarboxylation of OA. With the best catalyst
determined, the effects of process parameters including temperature,
space time, and water-to-OA (v/v) ratio were studied in hydrothermal
media (subcritical water) using a continuous fixed-bed catalytic reactor.
The catalytic activities for decarboxylation of several fatty acid
derivatives including castor oil, frying oil, palm oil were then investigated.
Characterization of fresh and spent catalysts was conducted using
several physicochemical techniques including N2-physisorption
[Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area and Barrett–Joyner–Halenda
(BJH) pore size distribution], NH3 temperature-programmed
desorption (NH3-TPD), X-ray diffraction (XRD), H2 temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR), CO pulse chemisorption,
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), transmission electron microscopy
(TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and energy dispersive X-ray
spectroscopy (EDXS).

Results and Discussion
Characterization of Fresh
Catalysts
Mo, MgO, and Ni
catalysts are extensively used for decarboxylation of lipid-based
feedstocks30−32,34−38 and of interest for this study. The first part of this study investigated
the production of three metals on an alumina support using an incipient
impregnation method, with a target of 10 wt % metal on alumina. EDXS
analysis was performed to quantify the actual metal loading for catalyst
synthesis, with the results shown in Table 1 and Figure S1. The actual loading of Mo and Ni was found to be 10.1 and 10.0 wt
%, respectively. The wt % of Mo (9.10%) was also confirmed by XPS
analysis. Because EDXS cannot determine the oxidation state of any
metal, the actual loading of MgO was calculated from the weight difference
between the catalyst sample after calcination and before loading,
that is, 9.76 wt %. However, no elemental S was detected for the 10
wt % MgO–Al2O3 catalyst during EDXS analysis.

Textural properties of any catalyst are important
parameters to
measure its catalytic activity. N2 adsorption–desorption
isotherms and pore size distributions are displayed in Figure S2 and their corresponding pore properties
are shown in Table 2. The isotherms of Al2O3 in Figure S2(i)a, fresh 10 wt % Mo–Al2O3 in Figure S2(i)b, 10 wt % MgO–Al2O3 in Figure S2(i)c,
and 10 wt % Ni–Al2O3 in Figure S2(i)d showed a typical type IV isotherm with a H1-type
hysteresis loop. This indicates that all fresh catalysts possessed
a mesoporous structure.39,40 Mesoporosity of the
prepared catalysts was confirmed by pore size distributions in Figure S2(ii). As presented in Table 2, the BET surface area and pore
volume of all fresh catalysts are lower than those of the support,
indicating that Mo, MgO, and Ni loadings partially blocked Al2O3 pores during the catalyst preparation step (impregnation
method). BET surface area and pore volume of the three synthesized
catalysts are slightly different from each other, which follows the
order: 10 wt % MgOAl2O3 > 10 wt % Mo–Al2O3 > 10 wt % Ni–Al2O3. The average pore diameters of all fresh catalysts are analogous
to each other and slightly lower than that of the Al2O3 support.

Decarboxylation of
free fatty acids is known to largely depend
on the acidity of the catalyst. For example, Hengst et al.33 found enhanced deoxygenation activity of free
fatty acids for diesel fuel production using an acidic catalyst (Pd/Pural
SB1-derived Al2O3). The NH3 TPD of
fresh catalysts is shown in Figure 1 to determine the acidity of the investigated catalysts.
The peak at around 100–350 °C is assigned to the Lewis
acid sites and the peak at 500 °C represents the Bronsted acid
sites, respectively, in the TPD profiles.41−43 The NH3 TPD profiles show that all catalysts contain mostly Lewis
acid sites. The total amounts of ammonia desorbed by Mo–Al2O3, Ni–Al2O3, and
MgO–Al2O3 are 33.5, 25, and 24.3 mL STP/g.
The value of NH3 uptake indicates that the overall acidity
of the Mo–Al2O3 catalyst is comparatively
higher than that of the Ni–Al2O3 and
MgO–Al2O3 catalysts.

Figure 1 NH3 TPD of
fresh catalysts.

Crystallinity of a metal-supported
catalyst is usually measured
by XRD. Figure 2(i)
shows the XRD patterns of all fresh catalysts with support. Pure γ-Al2O3 phases at 2θ = 35.2, 47.2, and 67.6°
are found in Figure 2(i)a.38 Mostly, MoO2 phases were found in the XRD pattern of
fresh 10 wt % Mo–Al2O3 catalyst [Figure 2(i)b], which implies
that Mo is a hard to reduce metal, even using a reduction temperature
of 950 °C. Very weak reflections of pure Mo are observed at 2θ
= 42 and 61°. Fresh 10 wt % MgO–Al2O3 and 10 wt % Ni–Al2O3 catalysts show
mainly MgAl2O4 and NiAl2O4 phases, which indicates that all MgO and Ni particles react with
Al2O3 to form MgAl2O4 and
NiAl2O4, respectively [Figure 2(i)d,f]. Spinel MgAl2O4 phase was found at 2θ = 37.1, 45.3, and 66.1°. Spinel
NiAl2O4 phase was found at 2θ = 37, 45,
and 66°. No XRD peaks of MgO and Ni were found for the fresh
catalysts, which may be due to the overlapping by reflections of MgAl2O4 and NiAl2O4 peaks or enhanced
MgO or Ni dispersion on the catalyst surface.44,45 Higher temperature for reduction or calcination enhances the formation
of MgAl2O4 and NiAl2O4.46 No MgSO4 or S peaks were
found in fresh 10 wt % MgO–Al2O3 catalyst
as MgSO4·7H2O was used as the MgO precursor.
S usually shows sharp peaks between 15 and 60°.47 The sharp peak intensity of fresh 10 wt % Ni–Al2O3 catalyst compared to fresh 10 wt % MgO–Al2O3 and 10 wt % Ni–Al2O3 catalysts indicates the smaller metal particle phases present on
the surface. Moreover, no reflections for θ-Al2O3 (25.6 and 43.3°) or α-Al2O3 (31.2 and 36.6°) were evident on the reduced catalysts. This
indicates that phase changes of Al2O3 were not
enhanced by the chosen reduction/calcination temperature.

Figure 2 (i) XRD patterns
of fresh and spent catalysts and (ii) TPR profiles
of fresh catalysts.

H2-TPR experiments
were conducted to determine the optimum
reduction temperature of the investigated catalysts. H2-TPR profiles of fresh catalysts are shown in Figure 2(ii). Four reduction peaks are observed in
the TPR profile of fresh 10 wt % Mo–Al2O3 at 475, 666, 925, and 1065 °C, respectively. It has been reported
that Mo species reduction is a two-step process such as MoO3 to MoO2 and then MoO2 to Mo.48 Different reduction temperatures obtained in the TPR profile
indicate the formation of different Mo species. It was previously
reported that four types of Mo phases were formed during the reduction
of Mo-based catalyst. Two forms of Mo species were reported by Ma
et al.49 One was polynuclear (located on
the external surface of the support), either in a square-pyramidal
coordination as MoOx form or in an octahedral
coordination as MoO3 crystallite form. The second one was
related to Al atoms in the lattice channel of support. The reduction
peak at 475 °C of fresh 10 wt % Mo–Al2O3 is ascribed to the reduction of MoO3 to MoO2.50 The strong peak assigned to
1065 °C indicates further reduction of MoO2 to form
metallic Mo.51 The reduction peaks at 666
and 925 °C may be ascribed to the initial and the further reduction
of the aggregative MoO3 species.48

Fresh 10 wt % MgO–Al2O3 catalyst
shows
its only reduction peak at 475 °C, which represents the reduction
of MgAl2O4. Usually two major reduction peaks
at 250–350 and 600 −850 °C are observed for Ni–Al2O3 catalyst, corresponding to the easily reducible
NiO and hard to reduce NiO, respectively.52 Because there is no peak observed around 250–350 °C
in this study, all NiO reacts with Al2O3 to
form NiAl2O4. The reduction peak of NiAl2O4 was observed at 750 °C for the fresh 10
wt % Ni–Al2O3. Reducibility of nickel
catalysts largely depends on the wt % of nickel, calcination or reduction
temperature, and the interaction between the metal and support.53 Calcination or reduction at high temperature
increases the metal–support interaction and the formation of
NiAl2O4, which results in greater difficulty
of nickel catalysts in reduction.

The metal–support interaction
and the ease of reduction
are determined from both the peak width and the reduction temperature.
The wide peak represents a strong metal–support interaction
and the higher temperature for reduction indicates a hard to reduce
metal. It is observed from the TPR-H2 profile that both
fresh 10 wt % Mo–Al2O3 and 10 wt % Ni–Al2O3 were reduced at higher temperature compared
to fresh 10 wt % MgO–Al2O3 catalyst.
Comparing the fresh Mo- and Ni-based catalysts, the Mo catalyst was
reduced at higher temperatures. However, the TPR-H2 peaks
for the MgO catalyst are comparatively narrower than those for the
other two catalysts, indicating a weak interaction of MgO with Al2O3. The H2-TPR results are consistent
with the XRD results.

For a more detailed investigation of the
surface structure, XPS
spectra of the fresh 10 wt % Mo–Al2O3 are presented in Figure 3. The spectra were curve-fit using the screened and unscreened
peak-fitting parameters [peak positions, full width at half-maximum
(fwhm), and area ratios] for Mo(IV) as outlined by Scanlon et al.54 The parameters obtained for fresh 10 wt % Mo–Al2O3 catalyst are provided in Table S1. An Mo 3d5/2–Mo 3d3/2 spin–orbit double for Mo(VI) was constrained to have an area
ratio of 3:2, equal fwhms, a doublet spacing of 3.13 eV, and an Mo
3d5/2 peak position ranging from 232.2 to 232.6 eV. Peak
fitting showed that a small component attributable to Mo(V) was also
present. As such, a spin–orbit doublet, constrained to have
a similar fwhm as that for the Mo(VI) component, was added with an
Mo 3d5/2 peak position ranging from 231.6 to 231.9 eV.55,56 It should be noted that the presence of the component attributed
to Mo(V) in this fitting may be due to some portion of the Mo(IV)
unscreened peak structure not accounted for by Scanlon et al.54 fitting, possibly due to spectrometer differences.
Mo(V) may also be present because of the X-ray reduction of MoO3 during the analysis.57

spectra of Mo (3d) for 10 wt % Mo/Al2O3 catalyst
(detail peak assignment shown in Tables S1 and S7).

Percent metal dispersion
is an important parameter for a metal-supported
catalyst, which enhances greatly the catalytic reaction. Pulse chemisorption
experiments were conducted to quantify the % metal dispersion, the
active metal surface area, and the active particle size of metal crystals
on the alumina surface. Table 3 shows the CO pulse chemisorption data for 10 wt % Mo–Al2O3 and 10 wt % Ni–Al2O3 catalysts. Metal dispersion (2.49%) was found for fresh 10 wt %
Mo–Al2O3 catalyst, whereas the value
is smaller for fresh10 wt % Ni–Al2O3 catalyst.
Higher metallic surface area per gram of sample and per gram of metal
were also obtained for fresh 10 wt % MgO–Al2O3 catalysts compared to fresh 10 wt % Ni–Al2O3. Smaller active metal particle size was observed in
fresh 10 wt % Mo–Al2O3 catalyst. The
obtained larger metal particle size from the Ni-based catalyst is
attributed to the lower dispersion and metallic surface area.

and Spent Catalysts

The morphology of the fresh catalysts was observed
using TEM. The
10 wt % Mo–Al2O3 catalyst shows small
metal particles distributed over the surface, whereas the 10 wt %
Ni–Al2O3 and 10 wt % MgO–Al2O3 catalysts have larger metal particles on their
surfaces (Figure 4).
Small Mo particles improve the % metal dispersion and reduce the active
particle diameter, whereas the larger metal particles of Ni and MgO
catalysts reduce the % metal dispersion. Smaller particle size provides
more active sites for the decarboxylation reaction compared to larger
particle size. The TEM results are consistent with the CO pulse chemisorption
results.

Decarboxylation of OA
Screening of Decarboxylation
Catalyst
The initial experiments
compared the catalytic activities for OA decarboxylation in a continuous
flow reactor using 10 wt % loading of Ni, Mo, and MgO on γ-Al2O3 at 375 °C, space time of 4 h, and ratio
(v/v) of water-to-OA = 5:1 using 5 g of catalyst. Figure 5 depicts the attenuated total
reflection–Fourier transform infrared (ATR–FTIR) spectra
of the decarboxylated liquid products with the degree of decarboxylation
being calculated by eq 1. The results show that the degree of decarboxylation of OA varied
strongly using the investigated catalysts, being 67, 65, and 92% using
a 10 wt % MgO–Al2O3, 10 wt % Ni–Al2O3, and 10 wt % Mo–Al2O3 catalyst, respectively. The obtained liquid and gaseous product
yields using these three catalysts are liquid yield = 65, 30, and
71% and gaseous yields are 35, 70, and 29%, for the 10 wt % MgO–Al2O3, 10 wt % Ni–Al2O3, and 10 wt % Mo–Al2O3, respectively.
The low liquid and high gaseous product yields indicate that the 10
wt % Ni–Al2O3 catalyst is primarily a
gasification catalyst, consistent with our previous work on supercritical
water gasification.58−61

Figure 5 ATR–FTIR
spectra of (a) OA and the formed products using
different catalysts such as (b) 10 wt % MgO–Al2O3, (c) 10 wt % Ni–Al2O3, and (d)
10 wt % Mo–Al2O3.

Although all catalysts have similar BET surface area, higher
acidity
and metal dispersion of 10 wt % Mo–Al2O3 catalysts are favored for a higher degree of decarboxylation (92%).
Higher metal dispersion, metallic surface area, and smaller metal
particle sizes of the 10 wt % Mo–Al2O3 catalyst provide more active sites for decarboxylation of fatty
acids. Hengst et al.33 showed that an acidic
catalyst enhanced the deoxygenation and cracking of free fatty acids
into diesel fuels.

Because the molar mass of Mo (96 g) is higher
than those of Ni
(58.7 g) and MgO (40.3 g), the molar percentages of Ni and MgO in
10 wt % Ni–Al2O3 and 10 wt % MgO–Al2O3 catalysts are much higher than that of Mo in
the 10 wt % Mo–Al2O3 catalyst at the
same loading wt %. Hence, the catalytic performance of the 10 wt %
Mo–Al2O3 catalyst is much better than
the other two.

The gaseous products CO and CO2 found
in the product
streams are compared in Figure S3. The
Ni–Al2O3 and MgO–Al2O3 catalysts gave a higher yield of CO compared to CO2, whereas the Mo–Al2O3 catalyst
provided a high yield of CO2 compared to CO. This indicates
that the Mo-based catalyst dominates the decarboxylation of OA under
the chosen reaction conditions at which the best catalyst was determined
for this study. Significant amounts of H2 and CH4 and lighter fractions of hydrocarbons (C2 to C4) were found using the Ni–Al2O3 catalyst
(data not shown). On the basis of these initial ATR–FTIR and
gas chromatography–thermal conductivity detection (GC-TCD)
results, the 10 wt % Mo/Al2O3 catalyst was chosen
for the subsequent parametric study examining the experimental conditions.

Table S2 shows carbon balance using
10 wt % MgO/Al2O3, 10 wt % Ni/Al2O3, and 10 wt % Mo/Al2O3 catalysts
for the decarboxylation of OA at 375 °C, space time of 4 h, and
water-to-OA (v/v) ratio of 5:1 using 5 g of catalyst. The carbon balance
in all cases is found to be 97 to 99%.

Effect of Reaction Parameters
on Degree of Decarboxylation
Reaction parameters including
temperature, water-to-OA (v/v) ratio,
and space time (τ) are the three most important parameters for
a continuous hydrothermal decarboxylation reaction. ATR–FTIR
spectra of the decarboxylated liquid products obtained under different
experimental conditions (T = 325 to 400 °C,
ratio (v/v) of water to OA = 2:1 to 5:1 & space time = 0.5 to
4 h) using 5 g of 10 wt % Mo–Al2O3 catalyst
are presented in Figure 6, whereas Figure S4 shows the corresponding
degree of decarboxylation. The results show that increasing temperature
from 325 to 375 °C enhanced the percent decarboxylation (from
55 to 92%) (Figure S4a). Further increasing
of temperature from 375 to 400 °C improved the degree of decarboxylation
by only 0.3%. The results show that the degree of decarboxylation
of OA is less sensitive to temperature above 375 °C. Therefore,
the maximized temperature chosen for this study was 375 °C.

Figure 6 ATR–FTIR
spectra of (a) OA and the products formed using
water-to-OA (v/v) ratio of 5:1 and 4 h of reaction time at (b) 325,
(c) 350, (d) 375, and (e) 400 °C.

The effects of process parameters of water-to-OA ratio (v/v)
and
space time at 375 °C on the formed decarboxylated products are
presented in Figure 7. Figure S4b,c shows their corresponding
degree of decarboxylation. The results indicate that increasing the
ratio (v/v) of water-to-OA from 2:1 to 5:1 and space time from 0.5
to 4 h enhanced the percent decarboxylation. The maximum degree of
decarboxylation (92%) was obtained at 375 °C, ratio (v/v) of
water-to-OA = 5:1, and space time = 4 h. On the basis of these results,
the maximized process conditions for maximum removal of −COOH
peak using the 10 wt % Mo–Al2O3 catalyst
for the current study were 375 °C, ratio of water-to-OA (v/v)
= 5:1, and space time = 4 h, respectively.

°C for different reaction times using different ratios of water-to-OA

h and ratio of 5:1; (e) 4 h and ratio of 5:1; (f) 4 h and ratio of
4:1; (g) 4 h and ratio of 3:1; and (h) 4 h and ratio of 2:1.

The peak for alkenyl =CH
stretching at 3004 cm–1 (Figures 6 and 7) disappeared
for all products obtained using catalyst.
This indicates that the 10 wt % Mo–Al2O3 catalyst is not only a decarboxylation but also a hydrogenation
catalyst (C=C to C–C). There are some other peaks such
as C–O stretching and O–H deformation (combined) at
1412 cm–1 and out-of-plane O–H bending at
934 cm–1, which also significantly decreased in
the liquid product. This corroborates that the Mo–Al2O3 catalyst enhances the decarboxylation of OA.

Gas
chromatography–Flame Ionization Detection Analysis
of Liquid Products
Use of liquid products as commercial fuel
largely depends on an understanding of controlling the molecular fingerprint. Figure 8 displays the hydrocarbons
identified in the liquid decarboxylated products at the studied experimental
conditions using 5 g of 10 wt % Mo–Al2O3 catalyst. Selectivity of hydrocarbon varies with temperature, as
presented in Figure 8a. The selectivity of tetradecane increased from 0 to 34.8% and pentadecane
selectivity decreased from 49.3 to 24% with increasing temperature
from 325 to 375 °C. At the same time, the selectivity of hexadecane
decreased from 39 to 22.9% and the selectivity of hetadecane slightly
increased from 10.7 to 18.3%. Lower heptadecane and higher tetradecane
selectivities at 375 °C indicate that the Mo-based catalyst cracks
OA into smaller hydrocarbons.

Figure 8 Hydrocarbons present in the liquid products
at different (a) temperatures,
(b) water-to-OA ratios (v/v), and (c) space times.

Selectivities of hydrocarbon compounds vary with
the space time
and water-to-OA (v/v) ratio. Figure 8b,c shows the effect of water-to-OA ratio and space
time on the distribution of hydrocarbon compounds in the liquid decarboxylated
products. The selectivity of tetradecane increased (from 34.8 to 77%)
with decreasing water-to-OA ratio (v/v) from 5:1 to 2:1 and decreased
(from 34.8 to 14.5) with decreasing space time from 4 to 0.5 h. The
selectivity of pentadecane increased (from 7.2 to 24% and 9.2 to 24%)
with increasing ratio (v/v) from 2:1 to 5:1 and space time from 0.5
to 4 h, respectively. The selectivity of hexadecane slightly increased
with increasing ratio (v/v) of water-to-OA and space time. The selectivity
of heptadecane increased with increasing ratio and decreased with
increasing space time. The results conclude that higher temperature
and lower water-to-OA ratio (v/v) and space time favor higher selectivity
of hepatadecane (73.6%), whereas higher temperature, water-to-OA ratio
(v/v), and space time provide higher tetradecane selectivity (34.8%).
Lower selectivity of heptadecene for all catalytic experiments indicates
a higher degree of saturation of C=C to C–C. This result
is consistent with the ATR–FTIR results.

Mass balances
for all experiments in this study were found to be
in the range of 97 to 99%. Figure S5 shows
the mass balance of the experiment conducted at the maximized reaction
conditions. Comparing the conversion and liquid yield or selectivity
of the current study and the literature data (Table 4) shows that the decarboxylation study using
different reaction conditions such as mode of operation, operating
conditions, and catalyst provides various results. Most of the studies
reported in the literature have been conducted under an H2 atmosphere to enhance the decarboxylation reaction. The maximum
conversion (∼100%) was obtained using NiMoS2/γ-Al2O3, Ni/ZrO2, and Pd/SiO2 catalysts
using hydrogen, whereas the current study showed 91% conversion without
adding any hydrogen. Table S3 shows the
selectivity of heptadecane between the current study and the literature
data, which was obtained from OA conversion using different catalysts.
The highest heptadecane selectivity reported is 89.3% from OA using
activated carbon as the catalyst.24 The
objective of the current study was to find a cost effective metal-supported
catalyst for decarboxylation of fatty acids and their derivatives
with no added H2. Our study provided up to 91% conversion
of OA (degree of decarboxylation) with a 71% liquid yield at the maximized
reaction conditions using the Mo/Al2O3 catalyst.

Comparison
between the current study and the literature data in
terms of selectivity of heptadecane from the catalytic conversion
of OA (see Table S3) indicates that the
selectivity of heptadecane varies with the process parameters and
types of catalysts used. Our study showed 73.6% selectivity for heptadecane
using a water-to-oil ratio of 5:1 (v/v) and 0.5 h of space time at
375 °C, with a degree of decarboxylation of 58.6%. On the other
hand, the selectivity of heptadecane was 18.3% at 4 h of space time
with a degree of decarboxylation of 91%. The results indicate that
the Mo catalyst is cracking higher-length hydrocarbon chains at longer
space times, increasing the degree of decarboxylation. Although the
liquid product in this study contains a broad distribution of hydrocarbons,
the liquid product falls within the range of commercial fuels such
as kerosene, diesel, and jet fuels (discussed in the following section).

Fuel Quality
Density is an important physical characteristic
of liquid fuel, which determines whether it can be used as diesel,
kerosene, or jet fuel. For liquids, temperature is an important factor
that can affect the density of a liquid with density being expressed
at a given temperature for comparison purposes. The values of density
at different temperatures of the product obtained at maximized conditions
are compared with commercial fuels and listed in Table 5. Comparing the experimental
data with conventional fuels indicates that the decarboxylated product
falls within the typical diesel range.

High heating value (HHV) is
the most important parameter for any
fuel, which determines the tendency to produce more energy in the
engine. Fuels with lower HHV tend to burn inadequately, initiating
air pollution.76Table 6 shows the HHVs of the obtained decarboxylated
products with some commercial fuels. The results indicate that the
HHV of the decarboxylated product is similar to jet fuel, kerosene,
and diesel.

GC-TCD Analysis
of Gaseous Products
Decarboxylation
of OA was confirmed by analyzing the gaseous products using GC-TCD.
The results obtained at different reaction temperatures are presented
in Figure S6. The number of moles of CO
and CO2 were decreased and increased, respectively, with
increasing reaction temperature from 325 to 375 °C. This result
shows that decarboxylation is the dominating reaction at 375 °C,
although 10 wt % Mo–Al2O3 catalyst slightly
cracks the reactant molecules into smaller hydrocarbons. The GC-TCD
results help confirm the ATR–FTIR results. Lighter fraction
of hydrocarbons was found in the gaseous products, accounting for
about 1.75 wt % of the total products (Figure S5).

Decarboxylation of Fatty Acid Derivatives
Hydrothermal
decarboxylation of three nonedible feedstocks including castor oil,
palm oil, and frying oil (compositions will be found in Tables S4–S6) was performed at the maximized
conditions achieved for OA decarboxylation. The maximized conditions
are: T = 375 °C, water-to-oil ratio = 5:1(v/v),
space time = 4 h, and amount of catalyst = 5 g (10 wt % Mo–Al2O3). The ATR–FTIR results of the formed
products from castor oil, palm oil, and frying oil are shown in Figure 9.

Figure 9 ATR–FTIR spectra
of (a) castor oil, (b) the formed product
from castor oil, (c) palm oil, (d) the formed product from palm oil,
(e) frying oil, and (f) the formed product from frying oil.

In the spectrum of castor oil
(Figure 9a), there
are several absorbance peaks at
3388, 3007, 2923, 2853, 1742, 1653, 1456, 1240, 1161, 1032, and 723
cm–1 resulting from hydroxyl, alkenyl, methylene,
and carboxylic ester groups of ricinoleic acid contained in the castor
oil. Alcoholic O–H and C–O stretching peaks are observed
at 3388 and 1032 cm–1, whereas the peaks at 3007
and 1653 cm–1 are ascribed to alkenyl =CH
& C=C stretching, respectively. The peaks at 2923, 2853,
and 723 cm–1 are attributed to methylene C–H
asymmetric stretching, symmetric stretching, and rocking modes, respectively.
The peak at 1456 cm–1 is assigned to methylene C–H
scissoring and methyl C–H asymmetric bending modes. The peaks
at 1742, 1240, and 1161 cm–1 are attributable to
carboxylic ester C=O stretching and C–O stretching modes
of the glycerol ester, respectively. After the decarboxylation reaction,
C=O, C–O, O–H, C=C, and =C–H
peaks disappear, whereas a few new peaks appear with the peak at 1711
cm–1 being ascribed to the carboxylic C=O
stretching mode (Figure 9b). These results confirm the conversion of carboxylic ester (C(=O)–O),
alcoholic OH, and alkenyl (C=C) groups and formation of small
amount of carboxylic acid (−COOH).

In comparison to the
spectrum of castor oil (Figure 9a), the spectrum of palm oil (Figure 9c) shows an additional absorbance
peak at 1708 cm–1, which is ascribed to the C=O
stretching of the carboxylic acid group contained in palm oil. Similar
to that seen for castor oil (Figure 9b), after the decarboxylation reaction, C=O,
C–O, C=C, and =C–H peaks disappear, whereas
the peak at 1708 cm–1 decreases significantly. These
results confirm the conversion of carboxylic ester (C(=O)–O),
carboxylic acid (−COOH), and alkenyl (C=C) groups.

The spectrum of frying oil is displayed in Figure 9e. Similar to that of castor oil (Figure 9b), after the decarboxylation
reaction, C=O, C–O, C=C, and =C–H
peaks disappear, whereas a few new peaks appear with the peak at 1711
cm–1 being ascribed to carboxylic C=O stretching
mode (Figure 9f). These
results confirm the conversion of carboxylic ester (C(=O)–O),
alcoholic OH, and alkenyl (C=C) groups and formation of small
amount of carboxylic acid (COOH).

Decarboxylation of castor,
palm, and frying oil was further confirmed
by GC-TCD analysis of gaseous products formed during the reaction. Figure S7 shows the number of moles of CO or
CO2 present in the gaseous products. The amounts of CO2 were found to be 0.88, 0.86, and 0.77 mol in the gaseous
products formed during the decarboxylation of castor, frying, and
palm oil. On the other hand, the quantities of CO were found to be
0.05, 0.13, and 0.23 mol, respectively. Although complete decarboxylation
was not achieved for the above three nonedible feedstocks, our hydrothermal
decarboxylation process shows significant feedstock feasibility to
decarboxylate any fatty acid or its derivatives without adding any
external hydrogen source or hydrogen donor solvent. These results
are potentially attractive to implement the process for commercial
production of liquid hydrocarbons from various feed sources, which
can help lower our dependency on fossil fuels.

Catalyst Deactivation Studies
A metal-supported catalyst
has a tendency for deactivation when it is exposed to harsh (high
temperature or pressure) hydrothermal environments. Deactivation of
a metal catalyst can occur from several factors including adsorption
of impurities from the feed/product streams, coke deposition on the
catalyst surface, oxidation of metal, metallic surface area reduction
from sintering/leaching, and a drop in surface area from pore blockage.78 XRD analysis was performed on all three spent
catalysts (Figure 2). Metal-supported spent catalysts usually show the peaks for graphitic
coke formation at 2θ = 62° and atomic coke formation at
2θ = 30°, respectively.5,58 From the XRD
pattern, no such peak was found for all three catalysts (Figure 2c,e,g). There were
no significant differences observed in the XRD patterns for fresh
and spent 10 wt % MgO/Al2O3 and 10 wt % Ni/Al2O3 catalysts. On the other hand, peak intensities
for the spent 10 wt % Mo/Al2O3 catalyst were
found to be larger than those of its fresh one, indicating catalyst
agglomeration from the decarboxylation reaction. Agglomeration of
Mo particles may be the main reason for the observed reduction of
the BET surface area of spent Mo catalyst compared to the spent MgO
and Ni catalysts (Table 2 and Figure S2i). The lower BET surface
area observed for the spent Mo catalyst may be due to pore blockage
by produced hydrocarbon molecules which did not wash out with hexanes
or catalyst drying step. Although all spent catalysts have lower BET
surface areas than their fresh ones, they still maintain the mesoporous
pore size distributions (Figure S2ii).

The surface morphology of the synthesized catalysts were examined
by SEM imaging both before and after the decarboxylation reaction
(Figure S8). All fresh catalysts showed
uniform metal/metal oxide particle distribution on the surface of
the catalysts, indicating better catalytic properties. Although the
Ni catalyst has a morphology similar to that of the Mo and MgO catalyst,
the Ni catalyst was found to gasify the feedstock at the chosen reaction
conditions instead of decarboxylation (explained earlier). The agglomerated
structure of the spent 10 wt % Mo–Al2O3 catalyst was confirmed from the SEM images. There were no morphological
differences observed for the fresh and spent 10 wt % MgO–Al2O3 and 10 wt % Ni–Al2O3 catalysts. These results are consistent with the XRD and BET results.

Elemental analysis was performed for all three spent catalysts
to see the composition differences between their fresh and spent states
(Figure S9). The weight percentages of
Mo and Ni were found to be 9.58 and 9.23 in the spent catalysts. Slightly
lower percentage of Mo and Ni in the spent catalyst does not indicate
metal leaching during the decarboxylation reaction. Deposition of
impurities (Figure S10) on the catalyst
surface may dilute the concentration of Mo and Ni. As mentioned earlier,
C found on the fresh catalysts originates from the sample holder.
However, the peak intensities of C in all three spent catalysts are
significantly larger those of the fresh ones, indicating that the
catalysts have carbon deposition from the decarboxylation reaction.
Because XRD did not detect any crystalline carbon (atomic or coke),
the carbon identified by EDXS analysis is likely amorphous carbon.
Amorphous carbon can be simply removed by calcining the catalyst above
the reaction temperature under an inert atmosphere.

Thermogravimetry/differential
thermal analysis (TG-DTA) was conducted
to quantify the deposited carbon on the catalyst surfaces based on
the weight loss with increasing temperature (Figure 10a–c). The weight loss and the corresponding
DTA peaks in TG-DTA spectra represent burning of three types of carbon
such as atomic carbon, amorphous carbon, and graphitic carbon. These
three carbons show DTA peaks at three temperature regions such as
<250, 250–600, and >600 °C, respectively.79 No peak was observed for all spent catalysts
at >600 °C, which confirms the absence of graphitic coke on
the
spent catalyst surfaces. The weight losses for spent Mo–Al2O3, Ni–Al2O3, and
MgO–Al2O3 are 30, 15, and 18, respectively.
These weight losses during TG-DTA correspond to only the formation
of atomic and amorphous carbon. Higher amount of carbon deposition
on spent Mo–Al2O3 catalyst is due to
the higher acidity of Mo–Al2O3 compared
to Ni–Al2O3 and MgO–Al2O3 catalysts. Higher acidity of catalyst is favorable
for higher degree of carbon deposition.80,81

Figure 10 (a–c)
TG-DTA of spent catalysts and (d) XPS survey spectra
of fresh and spent Mo/Al2O3 catalyst.

XPS survey spectra of fresh and
spent 10 wt % Mo–Al2O3 catalyst were
obtained to provide insight into
the Mo catalyst deactivation process (Figure 10d). Carbon in the fresh 10 wt % Mo–Al2O3 catalyst corresponds to adventitious carbon
which is typically detected in samples that have been exposed to the
atmosphere or generated during the analysis. The relative content
of C in the fresh catalyst is 16.5%, whereas the amount in the spent
catalyst was 43.6%. The difference between the quantities of carbon
in fresh and spent catalysts is 27.1%, which is closer to the amount
quantified by TG-DTA. Thus, large increase in C on the spent catalyst
indicates the deposition from the decarboxylation reaction. This C
potentially may be bound with multiple Mo ions, which is hard to remove
by simple hexane washing or vacuum drying.82 The existence of different states of Mo was also confirmed in the
spent 10 wt % Mo–Al2O3 catalyst using
high-resolution XPS spectra (Figure 3b and Table S7). A higher
percentage of Mo(IV) (77%) was found in spent sample compared to the
fresh one (40%), whereas the Mo(VI) component was decreased from 51
to 11% and the Mo(V) amount remained relatively constant at 9–12%,
respectively. Higher percentage of Mo(VI) state compared to other
oxidation states on the fresh catalyst surface may be the active catalytic
phase of decarboxylation. The results also indicates that reduction
of Mo (VI) to Mo(IV) was occurring by in situ hydrogen during decarboxylation
of fatty acids.

Catalyst Stability, Reusability, and Regeneration
Catalyst
stability is an important factor for commercializing any catalytic
process. Formation of graphitic coke on the metal-supported catalyst
surface mainly poisons the active sites of the catalyst and reduces
activity during the reaction. Graphitic coke formation also prevents
the reusability of any catalyst as it is very hard to burn off the
graphitic carbon during regeneration step. Stability study of Mo–Al2O3 was conducted at the maximized reaction conditions
until the catalyst starts to deactivate. ATR–FTIR spectra of
decarboxylated liquid products at the maximized reaction conditions
at 132 h (5.5 days) time on stream are shown in Figure 11. Deactivation of the catalyst
was measured by the degree of decarboxylation obtained at different
time of streams. Figure 11 shows that the degree of decarboxylation (∼92%) was
consistent over 72 h time on stream. This is the maximum degree of
decarboxylation obtained for this study. The degree of decarboxylation
started decreasing afterward. The values of degree of decarboxylation
obtained after 96 and 132 h time on stream were 60 and 48%, respectively.
Decreasing trend of degree of decarboxylation indicates that the catalyst
is losing its activity during the reaction. EDXS, XPS, and TG-DTA
of spent catalysts showed that a significant amount of carbon (atomic
and amorphous) was deposited on the catalyst surface during decarboxylation
reaction which is deactivating the catalyst. Deposited carbon is blocking
the actives sites of catalysts, which is retarding the decarboxylation
of OA. The disappearance of =C–H peak (∼3004
cm–1) during 132 h time on stream indicates that
the catalyst was active to saturate the final products.

Figure 11 FTIR spectra
of (a–e) the decarboxylated products at 132
h time on stream: (a) 24; (b) 48; (c) 72; (d) 96; (e) 132 h; and (f)
OA.

Deactivation of the catalyst necessitates
to regeneration step
because the degree of decarboxylation obtained using spent catalyst
was only 25% (Figure S11). Because only
atomic and amorphous carbon deposition were observed, it is easy to
remove these types of carbon by burning them off in the presence of
air. Spent Mo–Al2O3 catalyst (from stability
study) was regenerated by simply burning with air followed by reduction
afterward and reused second time for decarboxylation of OA at the
maximized reaction conditions. ATR–FTIR spectra of decarboxylated
liquid products using regenerated Mo–Al2O3 catalyst are presented in Figure S11 along
with the spectra of fresh and spent catalyst for comparison. The degree
of decarboxylation obtained using regenerated Mo–Al2O3 catalyst was 70%, whereas the value was 92% using fresh
catalyst. The regenerated catalyst was not able to achieve the same
degree of decarboxylation which may be due to the agglomeration of
metal particles after first use. Agglomeration of Mo particles in
the spent catalyst was confirmed by SEM imaging and CO pulse chemisorption
experiment (Figure S8 and Table 3) measuring the percent metal
dispersion and active particle size. The degree of decarboxylation
using regenerated catalyst was 70% during 72 h time on stream and
started decreasing afterward.

XRD patterns of regenerated and
spent regenerated catalysts have
the similar trend except the intensity difference (Figure S12a). The broad peaks of spent regenerated catalyst
indicate that the metal particles are agglomerating to make bigger
particle size during decarboxylation reaction. The formation of deposited
carbon on the surface of spent regenerated catalyst is quantified
by TG-DTA, which is about 12 wt % (Figure S12b). The formation of carbon on the catalyst surface during decarboxylation
indicates that it is hard to prevent. The BET surface area and pore
volume of regenerated catalyst are 102 m2/g and 0.30 cm3/g, whereas the values are 70 m2/g and 0.22 m3/g, respectively. N2 adsorption–desorption
isotherms of regenerated and spent regenerated Mo–Al2O3 catalyst have the similar pattern as fresh and spent
catalysts. BJH pore size distributions in both cases slightly shift
to large pore diameter range but still maintain the mesoporosity (Figure S12c). The surface morphology of spent
regenerated catalyst also indicates the agglomerated structure of
the catalyst (Figure S12d).

Conclusions
This work investigated three different catalysts including 10 wt
% Mo–Al2O3, 10 wt % MgO–Al2O3, and 10 wt % Ni–Al2O3 and showed that the Mo catalyst is an efficient catalyst for decarboxylation
of OA and their derivatives in subcritical water. The maximized conditions
for higher degree of decarboxylation of OA (92%) and liquid yield
(71%) were found to be 375 °C, water-to-OA ratio of 5:1 (v/v),
and space time of 4 h using 5 g of 10 wt % Mo–Al2O3 catalyst. The Mo catalyst was found to crack the OA
into smaller hydrocarbon molecules. The selectivities of OA to hydrocarbons
obtained at maximized reaction conditions were 34.8% tetradecane,
24% pentadecane, 22.9% hexadecane, and 18.3% heptadecane. The Mo catalyst
was also found to hydrogenate C=C to C–C with no added
hydrogen. This hydrothermal approach for decarboxylating real feedstocks
such as castor oil, palm oil, and frying oil is found to be promising
to produce oxygen-free liquid hydrocarbons.

The deactivation
studies of catalysts showed that the Mo catalyst
was slightly agglomerated compared to Ni and MgO catalysts. No graphitic
coke was found in the three evaluated catalysts but higher amount
of amorphous coke was detected in the Mo catalyst surface because
of its high acidity. Amorphous coke is easy to remove by simple calcination
and the catalyst can be reused.

nickel nitrate hexahydrate [Ni(NO3)2·6H2O], ammonium molybdate tetrahydrate [(NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O], and magnesium sulfate
heptahydrate [MgSO4·7H2O] were obtained
from Sigma-Aldrich, Canada, and are used as received. Alumina (γ-Al2O3) powder (Catalox SSCa 5/200) was obtained from
SASOL. Frying oil (used canola oil) was obtained from author’s
home and filtered to remove solid particles before use. Palm oil was
obtained from Malaysia. A compact ultrapure water system (EASY pure
LF, Mandel Scientific Co., model BDI-D7381) was used to obtain deionized
water (18.2 MΩ).

Catalyst Synthesis
Ni, Mo, and MgO
supported on γ-Al2O3 catalyst were synthesized
using an incipient
impregnation method.61,83 γ-Al2O3 was chosen as the support because it has larger surface area and
pore volume and higher acidity compared to other phases of Al2O3 (results will be found in Supporting Information, Figure S13). Larger surface area provides
more active sites and a higher acidic catalyst33 is favorable for decarboxylation. For a standard synthesis,
the desired amount of metal precursor for 10 wt % loading was dissolved
in deionized water equivalent to 120 vol % of pore volume of alumina
(0.50 cm3/gm). For example, 1 g of 10 wt % Ni–Al2O3 catalyst requires 0.50 g of Ni(NO3)2·6H2O and 0.9 g of Al2O3, 1
g of 10 wt % Mo catalyst requires 0.18 g of (NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O and 0.9 g of Al2O3, 1 g of 10 wt % MgO requires 0.64 g of MgSO4·7H2O and 0.9 g of Al2O3, respectively. The required support (alumina) was immersed into
the metal solution at once for better dispersion. The wet catalyst
was placed into a vacuum oven at 80 °C overnight. The dry powder
was then calcined into a muffle furnace at 600 °C @ 5 °C/min
for 4 h. Hydrogen reduction with 5 vol % H2 balanced with
N2 at 950 °C @ 3 °C/min for 2 h was performed
afterward for Ni and Mo catalysts only. The actual metal loadings
were confirmed by EDXS and XPS analysis.

Catalyst Testing
Decarboxylation of OA and its derivatives
was performed in a benchtop reaction system (BTRSJR, Autoclave Engineers,
Erie, PA) with a maximum allowable working pressure of 2900 psi @
650 °C. Figure 12 represents the detailed reactor setup. The system has a 10 mL tubular
reactor (316 stainless steel reactor tube with type 316 stainless
steel fittings) assembled with a furnace. The furnace temperature
was set 20 °C higher than the reaction temperature. The reactor
is connected with four feed lines for feeding either gas or liquids.
All feeds were mixed and vaporized into a mixer vaporizer before feeding
to the reactor. The feed stream then passed through the reactor. The
mixer is placed into an oven to preheat the feed mixture, whereas
the maximum oven temperature is 250 °C. A gas–liquid separator
is placed next to the reactor outside the oven. The separator is surrounded
by a cooling arrangement connected with a chiller, with the chiller
temperature maintained at 6 °C during the reaction to separate
the gas and liquid phases.

Figure 12 Schematic of continuous reactor setup.

Before starting any experiment,
the reactor was washed thoroughly
with soapy water, clean water, and then hexanes to remove any residuals
from previous experiments. Air was passed through the reactor to remove
any water or hexane sticking to the walls. Catalyst (5 g) was loaded
for each experiment into the reactor with quartz wool being placed
at the top and bottom of the reactor to maintain the catalyst inside.
All fittings were attached to the reactor, which was then placed into
the furnace. The main power of the system was turned on and the oven
temperature was set to the desired reaction temperature. The reaction
temperature was varied from 325 to 400 °C according to the experimental
methodology explained below. During the reactor heating, N2 gas was flowed through the reactor to remove any oxygen. N2 flow was then stopped and the reactor outlet was opened to remove
any N2 from the system. Two reactants (OA/its derivatives)
and water were then fed to the reactor continuously. Each experiment
was run for a minimum of 24 h and repeated at least three times in
this study and the average results are reported. The space time (τ)
was calculated from the volume of the catalyst (amount of catalyst/packed
density of catalyst) divided by the reactant flow rate. Both reactants
(fatty acid/derivatives and water) were accounted to calculate the
flow rates at ambient T and P. The
liquid and gaseous products were then collected and analyzed continuously
from the gas–liquid separator until the catalyst started to
deactivate. The liquid product was stored in glass vials. An air tight
Tedler gas bag (SKC Inc., PA) was used to store the gaseous product
for analysis. The spent catalyst collected for each run was thoroughly
washed with excess hexanes. Hexanes were discarded from the solid
catalyst. Liquid products which were stuck into catalyst bed were
collected afterward during hexane evaporation. The wet solid catalyst
was then dried at 80 °C for 12 h in a vacuum oven. The liquid
product yield is calculated as the weight of the liquid product after
reaction divided by the amount of OA fed to the reactor, whereas the
gaseous product yield is (1—liquid product yield).

Product Analysis
Types of hydrocarbons present in the
liquid product was quantified using a Shimadzu, GC-2014 equipped with
a flame ionization detector and a capillary DB WAX column (Agilent
Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) (dimension: 30 m × 0.250
mm × 0.25 μm, temperature limit: 20 to 260 °C). Helium,
hydrogen, and helium-air were used as the carrier, flame, and makeup
gas, respectively. The oven temperature programming was followed from
Hossain et al.84 Retention times of known
standards such as C8–C20 saturated hydrocarbons and heptadecene
(Sigma-Aldrich, Oakville, ON) were used to identify the types of hydrocarbons
in the liquid product. Sample (1 μL) with a 10:1 split ratio
was injected manually into the column. Repetitive injection for each
sample was performed until the similar peak area of interested compounds
was obtained. Selectivity of hydrocarbons present in the liquid product
was calculated from the following equation85−87 1  

The injector and detector temperatures
were retained at 200 and 250 °C, respectively.

Infrared
spectra (600–4000 cm–1 with a
resolution of 4 cm–1 over 64 scans) of feed and
liquid products were collected using an ATR–FTIR spectroscope
(Nicolet 6700 FTIR, Thermo Scientific). Degree of decarboxylation
was calculated using the following equation 2  

An Eagle Eye SG-Ultra Max
Hydrometer (Density meter) [dimension
= 5.5″ W × 5.5″ D × 1″ H (outside)]
and IKA C2000 bomb calorimeter were used to measure density and HHVs
of the liquid products.

Gaseous products formed during decarboxylation
reaction were measured
using a mixture of standard calibration gases (H2, N2, O2, CH4, CO, and CO2).
Gas sample (1 mL) using an SGE gas tight syringe (model number 008100,
Reno, NV USA) was injected manually into a nickel packed column (120/80
Hayesep D stainless steel 3.18 mm ID, 6.2 m L) of Shimadzu, GC-2014
(He as the carrier gas) which is connected with a thermal conductivity
detector. The oven temperature was held at 35 °C for 6 min followed
by 25 °C/min ramp and 1 min hold at 200 °C. The injector
and detector temperatures were maintained at 200 and 250 °C,
respectively. Injection was repeated multiple times for accuracy.
Lighter fractions of hydrocarbons (C2 to C4) were quantified as the
total no of moles of gas produced minus the number of moles of known
gas.

Catalyst Characterization
N2-Physisorption
A Tristar II 3020 (Micromeritics
Instrument Corporation, Norcross, GA, USA) instrument was used to
determine the BET surface area and BJH pore size distributions of
the fresh and spent catalysts at −193 °C using 99.995%
pure N2 gas obtained from Praxair (Oakville, Canada). Approximately,
80 mg of each catalyst sample was degassed under an N2 atmosphere
at 150 °C overnight before measurements. Degassing enhances the
removal of the adsorbed moisture from the catalyst surface.

XRD
Analysis
Crystallinity of catalyst samples was
analyzed using a Bruker D2 Phaser powder diffractometer over 2θ
= 10–80° using a scan rate of 0.1°/min and Cu Kα
radiation (λ for Kα is equal to 1.54059 Å).

H2-TPR Analysis
An Autochem II 2920 analyzer
(Micromeritics Instrument Corporation, Norcross, GA, USA) equipped
with a thermal conductivity detector was used to obtain the TPR profiles
of fresh catalysts by flowing 10% H2 balanced Ar at a rate
of 50 mL/min. A minimum of 140–150 mg of the catalyst sample
was used for each analysis. The temperature was increased from room
temperature to 1100 °C @ 10 °C/min.

CO Pulse
Chemisorption
An Autochem II 2920 analyzer
was used to determine the active particle diameter, the % metal dispersion,
and the active metal surface area of catalyst samples using a series
of 1 mL of CO pulses (10% CO balanced with Ar) injected into the catalyst
sample at 40 °C. The catalyst sample was pretreated with a stream
of Ar (50 mL/min) before CO pulses were injected.

NH3-TPD Analysis
NH3 TPD analysis
was conducted using a Micromeritics Autochem II 2920 analyzer coupled
with a thermal conductivity detector. Samples were pretreated at 400
°C @ 15 °C/min for 1 h under helium. The sample was then
cooled from 400 to 100 °C using 10% NH3 balanced with
He (50 cm3/min) for another hour. NH3 flow was
then stopped and He (50 cm3/min) was flowed at 100 °C
for 1 h to remove any physically adsorbed NH3. The temperature
was then increased to 850 °C @ 15°/min for desorption of
NH3 from the catalyst surface. The holding time at 850
°C was 1 h. The acidity of the catalysts was calculated from
the amount of NH3 desorbed from the acid sites of the catalyst
during the desorption process which was monitored by the thermal conductivity
detector.

TEM and SEM Imaging
The morphologies
of both the fresh
and spent catalysts were obtained from TEM (model JEOL 2010F) and
SEM imaging (LEO 1530).

EDXS Analysis
Elemental composition
of fresh and spent
catalysts was confirmed and quantified by using the EDXS feature of
the scanning electron microscope.

XPS Analysis
XPS
analysis of fresh and spent catalyst
samples was conducted with a Kratos Axis Ultra spectrometer using
a monochromatic Al Kα source (15 mA, 14 kV).
