Vanadium dioxide, a well-known phase
transition material with abrupt resistance change during its transition
temperature, is herein used to fabricate the transparent mesh film
onto a glass slide through self-assembly mesh printing. A record high
ON/OFF ratio up to 104 is achieved together with high visible
transmittance of 86% compared to the normal glass slide with visible
transmittance at 88%. The high transparent properties make the resistive
switches applicable for next-generation electronics, such as see-through
computing device and beyond. A simple and scalable mesh printing approach-integrated
phase change material may provide a promising way to fabricate transparent
resistance switches for next-generation electronics.

1 Introduction
Resistive
switching behavior has been reported among conductive organic materials
like poly(N-vinylcarbazole),1 perovskite oxide like SrTiO3,2 as well as common binary transition metal oxides (TMO), such as
ZnO,3,4 TiO2,5 Nb2O5,6 and VO23. Among all these materials, organic resistance
switches suffer from high operating voltage, while most TMO switches
such as ZnO, TiO2, and Nb2O5 face
the problem of low ON/OFF ratio. Vanadium dioxide (VO2)
is a compound that undergoes a metal-to-insulator transition (MIT)
at a temperature of ∼68 °C,7 which gives a high resistance change8 and makes it one of the most potential materials for the resistive
switching application.9 Besides, the near
room temperature MIT and the abrupt change of infrared transmission
make VO2 a potential candidate for some novel applications,
such as thermochromic smart windows,10−13 camouflage,14 and thermal actuator.15,16

The
resistive switches of VO2 have been classified into nonvolatile
and volatile types. Nonvolatile resistive switches can be integrated
into memristors,17 while the volatile ones
can be assembled as selectors in memristors or transistors or can
be coupled with capacitors or resistors into oscillators, which shows
potential applications in artificial neural networks and associative
neuromorphic computing.18 However, their
resistive switching behavior in the VO2 device has not
been fully exploited, as up to 104 resistance contrast
has been observed across the MIT.9 The
earlier VO2 resistance switch was constructed on Si/SiO2 substrate through chemical vapor deposition and the MIT occurred
at around 2 V, and the ON/OFF resistance ratio was less than 1 order
of magnitude.19 The recent works on VO2 resistance switches, such as VO2 electrodeposition
on Pt substrate20 and VO2 RF
sputtering on SiOx/Si substrate21 or c-sapphire,22,23 improved the
ON/OFF ratio within a certain degree. However, several challenges
still need to be tackled for the next generation of electronic devices,
such as high transparency as a component for transparent circuits,
high ON/OFF ratio, and low operation voltage.24 Moreover, most of the current works on VO2 resistance
switches focused on nonvolatile random access memory.25 With the development of artificial intelligence and the
internet of things, volatile threshold switches, which could be applied
in artificial neural networks and associative, are also highly in
demand.

In this study, we introduce an easy handling and inexpensive
method-mesh printing to fabricate VO2 film on the most
widely used glass substrate,26 which gives
the largest ON/OFF ratio, high transparency, and low operation voltage
in the application of volatile resistive switches compared with the
best-reported results.27

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Transparent VO2 Mesh Film Fabrication and Characterization
Figure 1a shows the photograph of the
as-fabricated VO2 mesh film on a glass slide, which displays
the high optical transparency of the mesh film. The detailed morphology
of the VO2 mesh film was observed through a scanning electron
microscope (SEM), as shown in Figure 1b. The inset images demonstrate the enlarged SEM image
of one knot within the VO2 mesh film and the corresponding
energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) mapping of the vanadium
element, which exhibits uniform and continuous distribution of VO2 nanoparticles within the VO2 mesh film. The SEM
figures of the VO2 mesh film overlapping with the EDX mapping
(Figure S1) is followed by the height profile
of the VO2 mesh film structure, measured by a ZEISS Smartproof
5 widefield confocal microscope (Figure S2). Figure 1c is the
visible transmittance spectrum range from 400 to 750 nm. From this,
one can see that the continuous VO2 mesh film exhibits
86% of visible transmittance at 550 nm, which is comparable with that
of a pure glass slide (around 88%) and is much higher than our previous
VO2 mesh work.26

VO2 mesh film; the inset is the enlarged SEM of one knot
and the corresponding EDX result of the vanadium element. (c) Visible
transmittance spectrum of the VO2 mesh film and a bare

Figure 2a shows the transmission electron microscopy
(TEM) image of VO2 nanoparticles as well as the selected
area electron diffraction (SAED) results, which illustrates the polycrystalline
characteristic of the VO2 nanoparticles. As shown in Figure 2b, the X-ray powder
diffraction (XRD) results of the as-fabricated transparent VO2 mesh film are consistent with the starting VO2 nanoparticles and both match well with the standard card of VO2 (PDF card no. 43-1051), which implies that the main functional
material of VO2 remains unchanged during the fabrication
process for the transparent VO2 mesh film. In Figure 2c, Raman peaks at
191 and 223 cm–1 indicate a V–V bond while
619 cm–1 peak matches well with the V–O bond
of the VO2 M phase, as well as the less intense peaks at
260, 308, 392, and 509 cm–1 are known to be Raman
modes of M phase VO2.28 Infrared
transmittance results of the transparent VO2 mesh film
are collected at a wavelength between 1000 and 2500 nm before (20
°C) and after (90 °C) the MIT. Figure 2d shows up to 2% decrease of transmittance
at high temperature, which proves that the MIT of VO2 occurs.
However, the transmittance difference is much smaller than the typical
VO2 film,29 which is due to
the limited amount of VO2 nanoparticles and the testing
area.

transmittance results of wavelengths between 1000 and 2500 nm at 20
°C (blue) and 90 °C (red).

2.2 Affecting Factors of the VO2 Mesh Film
Fabrication
During the fabrication of the transparent VO2 mesh film, several factors could be tuned to control the
continuous and transparency of the mesh film, such as the concentration
of VO2 nanoparticles dispersion and the usage of the surfactant.
First, the effect of surfactant is studied. It is found that the usage
of a small amount of the surfactant could dramatically decrease the
surface tension of the VO2 solution, which will be easier
to wet the glass slide through the stainless steel mesh. As shown
in Figure 3i, the surface
tension data of BYK 348 with a different concentration in deionized
(DI) water are collected. The pure DI water has a surface tension
up to 70.74 mN m–1, which was decreased to around
22.31, 21.48, and 20.52 mN m–1 when the concentration
of BYK increased from 0.01, 0.05, to 0.5 vol %, respectively. Similar
trends were also observed with different concentrations of VO2 nanoparticles (Figure 3ii). Due to the similar surface tension results with 0.01–0.5
vol % surfactant, the smallest weight percentage of 0.01 vol % BYK
was selected to mix with VO2 dispersion to obtain the high-quality
VO2 mesh film. The dispersion with the surfactant amount
below 0.01 vol % has a similar surface tension as DI water. Furthermore,
the effect of different concentrations of the VO2 dispersion
is studied. To avoid the precipitation of VO2 nanoparticles,
up to 3 wt % VO2 nanoparticles were dispersed into the
DI water. Surface tension results of different concentrations of VO2 solution with and without 0.01% BYK surfactant are also shown
in Figure 3ii.

concentration. Optical microscopy images for the VO2 mesh

(iii) 1 wt % VO2, 0.01 vol % BYK; (iv) 2 wt % VO2, 0.01 vol % BYK; (v) 3 wt % VO2, 0.01 vol % BYK; and
(vi) 3 wt % VO2, no BYK.

Figure 3iii,iv,v shows
the corresponding VO2 mesh films on a glass substrate with
different concentrations of VO2 nanoparticles and the same
amount of wetting dispersant (0.01 vol % BYK). With the lower loading
amount of VO2, large numbers of voids due to lack of nanoparticles
can be observed when averaged distances of broken lines are 32.5 μm
(Figure 3iii) and 15.1
μm (Figure 3iv)
approximately. With the increment of VO2 loading, such
voids diminished (Figure 3iii). It is illustrated that enough nanoparticles need to
be provided to form a complete mesh film. On the other hand, at the
same concentration of VO2 nanoparticles (3 wt %), certain
defects of blank and extra lines can always be observed in the sample
without using a surfactant (Figure 3vi), which is due to the relatively higher surface
tension. Therefore, 3 wt % of VO2 concentration with 0.01
vol % BYK surfactant gives the best quality of the VO2 mesh
film (Figure 3v).

2.3 Transparent VO2 Mesh Resistance Switches’
Performance
Figure 4a shows the schematic of the transparent VO2 mesh
resistance switch (fabrication details are shown in the Section 4). The Au/Ti electrodes are
aligned with the VO2 mesh line for the resistance switching
(RS) measurement. For comparison, the Au/Ti electrode deposited on
a bare glass substrate with the same pattern is shown in Figure 4b. To study the RS
behavior of VO2, we tested the I–V curves under the voltage sweep, as shown in Figure 4c. The device with an initial
high-resistance state (HRS) changes to a low-resistance state (LRS)
when applying the threshold voltage (Vth). This model correlated the coupling effect mechanism of electrical
and joule heating when applying voltage on the two-terminal RS device.
It is worth noting that the Vth for this
VO2 mesh RS is around 1.5 V, which is lower than the previously
reported value of around 6 V at room temperature.30 The switching time for the VO2 mesh switches
is less than 50 μs (Figure S3) due
to the machine testing limitation, which is much less than those of
some reported VO2 optical switches (around micrometers
range).8,31 However, none of the reported VO2 switches are transparent. As illustrated in Figure 4d, a durability test up to 50 cycles was
applied onto the VO2 mesh RS. Within the testing period,
the ratio of high- and low-resistance state was roughly maintained
at around 104. However, the switching ratio for VO2 mesh switches starts to drop after about 40 cycles, and the
XRD examination (Figure S4) shows that
the peak intensity of VO2 is diminished after 50 cycles.
This could be due to the long-standing durability issue of the VO2, which currently involves intensive research and is out of
the scope of this current research.32,33 More future
work could be conducted by the encapsulation of this RS to solve this
issue. The visible transmission spectrum was measured by switching
ON the threshold voltage, which showed that the VO2 resistance
switches remain highly transparent during the switching process (Figure S5).

Figure 4 Characterization of the VO2 mesh resistance switch. Optical images of (a) Au/Ti electrode deposited
on the VO2 mesh, (b) bare glass substrate, (c) I–V characteristic of the VO2 mesh resistance switch and the bare glass slide, and (d)
retention result of the VO2 resistance switch.

As mentioned in the Section 1, RS can be divided into two modes, nonvolatile memory
switching and volatile threshold switching.34,35 Here, the I–V characteristics
clearly demonstrate that the RS behavior is independent of the voltage
polarity and that there is only one stable resistance state at zero
voltage, which is corresponding to a typical unipolar volatile threshold
switching characteristic. The ON/OFF ratio for HRS and LRS in the
transparent VO2 resistance is more than 104,
which is the highest result among the transparent resistance switching
devices in recent years, as summarized in Figure 5. Resistance switches made from functional
materials including ZnO,36 ZnSrO3,37,38 and SrTiO339 could exhibit around 80–90% visible transmission.
However, the ON/OFF ratio of those resistance switches are no more
than 100. For the volatile threshold resistive switches applied in
selectors, artificial neuron networks, and associative computing,
higher ON/OFF ratio is required. The VO2-resistance change
could reach 104 due to its own intrinsic phase transition
property. Above all, the VO2 mesh shows high potential
for the transparent resistive switching application, due to its high
ON/OFF ratio and low-cost fabrication.

result of our work and recently reported resistance switches based
on poly-4-vinylphenol (PVP),40 ZnSnO3,37,38 WOx,41 SnO2/ZnO,36 SrTiO3,39 TiO2,42 BTCO,43 and Fe/SnO2.27

3 Conclusions
In this work, we reported a simple
and low-cost method to fabricate a transparent VO2 resistance
switch. Vanadium dioxide nanoparticles (VO2 NPs) with an
average diameter less than 100 nm were screen printed onto a common
glass slide by a stainless steel mesh to fabricate the transparent
resistance switch device through photolithography and e-beam evaporation
process. A volatile resistance switch behavior, as well as the highest
ON/OFF ratio up to 10 000 with a low operation voltage, was
achieved in the VO2 mesh film on the normal glass slide
with the high visible transmission of around 86%. The facile fabrication
method and novel micropatterned structures of the transparent mesh
VO2 resistance switching devices give a new promising direction
for next-generation electronic devices.

4 Experimental
Section
4.1 Materials
Vanadium dioxide nanoparticles
(VO2, weight-average molecular weight (Mw) = 82.94), purchased from Wenzhou Jingcheng Chemicals
and DisperBYK 348 without further purification. Deionized water (18.2
MΩ) was used throughout the experiments.

4.2 Fabrication
of the Transparent VO2 Mesh Film
The schematic
procedures of fabricating the transparent VO2 self-assembly
mesh film onto a glass slide are shown in Scheme 1. The glass slide with a thickness of about
1 mm is as purchased from Sail Brand 7107 Microscope Slides with further
washing by DI water and ethanol. The screen-printing mesh (Ponger
2000, Israel) was mounted directly above the clean glass slide. By
using a 100 μL pipette, a certain amount of VO2 dispersion
was dropped onto the glass slide substrate through the mesh. The VO2 dispersion was made through 10 min sonication of a certain
weight percentage of VO2 nanoparticles, DI water, and surfactant
BYK 348. A sonicator (Elmasonic S60H, Elma Ultrasonic) with the ultrasonic
frequency of 37 kHz with 550 W power consumption was used. When the
nanoparticles dispersion was dropped onto the top of the mesh, upon
contact, the liquid immediately wetted the mesh walls and space between
the mesh and glass slide, and then, with the evaporation of the DI
water, the VO2 nanoparticles self-assembled toward the
edge of the mesh walls due to the caterpillar force. Upon removing
the mesh, the VO2 mesh film was heated at 60 °C for
2 h in vacuum for water evaporation. At last, the final transparent
VO2 mesh film was obtained.

Film
4.3 Fabrication
of VO2 Resistance Switches
As-fabricated transparent
VO2 mesh film on the glass substrate was spin-coated (Headway
Research Spin Coater) with a layer of photoresist at 3000 rpm for
30 s (AZ5214E, photoresist image reversal, MicroChemicals GmbH) and
then prebaked at 105 °C. The alignment was adjusted by microscopy
to make sure that the VO2 nanoparticles branches were located
between the source and the drain. The electrode patterns were subsequently
transferred from the photolithography template to the VO2 mesh film by exposing to UV light for 4 s at ∼44 mW cm–2 (SUSS MicroTec, MJB4) and developed for 30 s (AZ
Developer: DI H2O = 1:1, AZ Electronic Materials GmbH).
Then, Ti/Au (30/150 nm) films were deposited by electron beam evaporation
(Edwards Auto 306). The microelectrodes were finally formed by a lift-off
process.

4.4 Materials and Device Characterization
Structural analysis of as-purchased and as-fabricated VO2 nanoparticles and the VO2 mesh film were determined by
Shimazu X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (λ =
0.1541 nm). The morphology of VO2 nanoparticles, as well
as the SAED (selected area electron diffraction), were characterized
using a transmission electron microscope (JEM-2010, JEOL, Japan) with
an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. The microstructures of the VO2 mesh film were observed by the optical and the field emission
scanning electron microscopes (JEM-7600F, JEOL, Japan). The element
analysis mapping of the VO2 mesh was also characterized
by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) attached with JEM-7600F.
The visible transmittance of transparent resistance switches and the
infrared transmittance for VO2 (M) confirmation were carried
out using Agilent Cary 5000 UV–vis–NIR spectrometer.
A heating stage (PE120, Linkam, U.K.) was employed to control the
temperature of the samples mounted on the spectrophotometer. The performance
of the VO2 mesh resistance switch was determined under
room temperature and atmospheric pressure. The I–V characteristics of the device were measured by Agilent
B1500A digital source meter connected with triaxial cables to the
probe station.
