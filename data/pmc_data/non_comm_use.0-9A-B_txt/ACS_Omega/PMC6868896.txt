Indole-3-carbinol (I3C) is the product
of the enzymatic hydrolysis
of glucobrassicin in the human body. I3C exhibits diverse bioactivities.
It is used as a supplement to enhance the efficiency of some cancer
therapies and is available as an over-the-counter dietary supplement
described as a potential antioxidant, among other health benefits.
Thus, it is important to develop an in-depth understanding of its
antioxidant activity. In this study, the hydroxyl radical scavenging
of I3C has been investigated in silico under physiologically relevant
conditions (aqueous and lipid-mimetic pentyl ethanoate environment)
using thermochemical and kinetic calculations. For benchmarking purposes,
the results were compared to known experimental data. The overall
reaction rate constant of the HO• radical scavenging
of I3C in water was found to be 2.30 × 1010 M–1 s–1 and over two times lower in
lipid-mimetic pentyl ethanoate solvent at 7.74 × 109 M–1 s–1. The results also highlighted
that the HO• radical scavenging follows almost exclusively
the radical adduct formation mechanism (>94%) in a lipid mimetic
medium,
whereas this mechanism contributes about 60% in aqueous environments.
I3C is considered a dopamine-like antioxidant, its main function being
prevention of oxidative degradation of lipids; our study supports
this view.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Indole-3-carbinol (I3C, Figure 1) is formed by the enzymatic hydrolysis of indole glucosinolates
in the human body. I3C is believed to exhibit potentially beneficial
biological activities, including regulation of drug metabolizing enzyme
systems, anticancer properties with low toxicity, and antioxidant
activity.1−7 The latter aspect of the bioactivity of I3C was somewhat neglected
against the others. However, oxidative damage is now believed to be
a factor in several diseases.8,9 It was shown that ionizing
radiation-induced formation of HO• radicals causes
the majority (60–70%) of tissue damage in biological systems.10 This radical can react with almost any molecule
in its neighborhood by several different mechanisms and at multiple
possible positions.11 It is also responsible
for most oxidative damage of DNA.12 Thus,
the hydroxyl radical scavenging activity of natural products is a
crucial aspect of their cancer–preventive activity and hence,
it is the emphasis in the evaluation of antioxidant activity.11−17

Figure 1 Structure
of I3C.

Experimental studies showed that
I3C and its derivatives have potential
radical scavenging activity with some I3C derivatives exhibiting higher
antioxidant activity than vitamin E (i.e., α-tocopherol) in
the DPPH model expressed by IC50 values.2 The rate constant for the reaction between I3C and HO• in aqueous solution was experimentally determined
to be 1.5 × 1010 M–1 S–1 and attempts were made to reproduce this value in silico.18 The computational works focused on the formation
of radical cations and radicals from I3C and thus chose single electron
transfer (SET) or/and hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) mechanisms to model
the reaction.18,19 However, as the radical adduct
formation (RAF) mechanism plays an important role in the HO• scavenging of double C=C bond-containing compounds,13,16,17,20 these studies could not fully explain the experimentally obtained
rate constant values. Moreover, the radical scavenging activity of
I3C in lipid media has not been investigated.

This study aims
to (1) model the HO• scavenging
activity of I3C in physiologically relevant environments following
three main antioxidant mechanisms (HAT, SET, and RAF) by using thermodynamic
calculations; (2) evaluate the kinetics of HO• radical
scavenging in comparison with experimental values; and (3) in light
of the kinetic data, assess the favored antioxidant mechanism of I3C
specific to each chemical environment.

2 Results
and Discussions
2.1 Acid–Base Equilibria
Antioxidant
activities of neutral and ionized compounds can show substantial differences.13,17 To perform calculations on the dominant form under physiological
conditions, the protonation states of the acidic moieties need to
be determined first. Proton affinities underpin pKa, and therefore these were calculated. As shown in Table
S1 (Supplementary Information), the lowest
PA value was observed at the N1–H bond. Thus, the acid–base
equilibrium of I3C was calculated for this group.21−23 The pKa was calculated by using the model shown in
(1), following the literature.24 The value
of pKa is defined by eq 2.22,24,25 1   2  where the HRef is melatonin (Figure 2) with the experimental pKa (N–H) = 12.3.26 The calculated
pKa value in this work
is 10.73. Consistently, I3C was modeled in its neutral form due to
the low ability of deprotonation at physiological pH (7.40), where
neutral I3C is the main form (99.95%) of this compound. Thus, the
sequential proton loss electron transfer27,28 was not considered in this study.

pKa.

The path and environment-specific reactivities of I3C toward HO• radicals in polar (water) and nonpolar (pentyl ethanoate)
environments via the HAT, SET, and RAF mechanisms were considered
according to the following reactions      

2.2 Thermochemical Evaluation
Bond dissociation
energies (BDEs) and ionization energies (IEs) of I3C were calculated,
and the results are shown in Table S1, Supporting Information. It was showed that the lowest BDE value was observed
at the C10–H bond with 85.0 and 86.9 kcal/mol in the aqueous
and lipid media, respectively. BDE values for N1–H and O11–H
are higher at 91.7 and 101.3 kcal/mol, respectively, in water, whereas
93.6 and 103.9 kcal/mol, respectively, in the nonpolar medium. These
values for the other C(2–8)–H bonds are considerably
higher in the range of 112.8–122.9 kcal/mol. At the same time,
the SET occurs more easily in the water than in the pentyl ethanoate
solvent (IE = 105.3 and 129.8 kcal/mol, in the polar and nonpolar
solvents, respectively, Table S1, Supporting Information). Thus, the radical scavenging of I3C following the HAT mechanism
is defined by the C10–H, O11–H, and N1–H bonds.

The Gibbs free energies (ΔG°) of the
reaction between I3C and HO• radicals following
the SET, HAT, and RAF pathways were computed and are shown in Table 1. It is important
to point out that the reactions of I3C and the HO• radical are spontaneous (ΔG° < 0)
in most cases, apart from the SET mechanism (ΔG° = 43.0 kcal/mol) in nonpolar solvent, the HAT mechanism in
the C2–H bond (ΔG° = 1.3 and 1.9
kcal/mol in polar and non-polar media, respectively), and the RAF
mechanism in the C4 and C9 positions in all of the studied media.
It was found that for the HO• radical scavenging,
the HAT mechanism decides the reaction rate at the X–H (X =
C10, O11, N1) bonds in water as well as pentyl ethanoate solvents
with low ΔG° values (−13.6 to −35.1
kcal/mol), whereas the RAF mechanism occurs at the C2, C3, C5, and
C8 positions with ΔG° values in the range
of −11.6 to −19.6 kcal/mol). Reactions with positive
ΔG° value (i.e., nonspontaneous reactions)
normally have a nonzero but still very little contribution to the
overall rate constants;,13 thus in this
study, only the spontaneous HO• radical scavenging
pathways (negative ΔG° values) were used
to compute the overall reaction rate constant (koverall) for the HO• scavenging of I3C.

2.3 Kinetic Study
Thermodynamic spontaneity
does not guarantee that a reaction would proceed with an appreciable
rate; therefore, activity is assessed based on kinetics.29 The rate constants of the hydroxyl radical scavenging
reactions following the three main pathways (SET, HAT, RAF) in the
studied environments were calculated, and the results are presented
in Table 2. The koverall in water is 2.30 × 1010 M–1 s–1, just under three times
higher than in the pentyl ethanoate solvent (7.74 × 109 M–1 s–1). The rate constant
calculated for water is in good agreement with the experimental value
(kexp = 1.50 × 1010 M–1 s–1).18 Antioxidant activity is dominated in both cases by the RAF mechanism,
> 94% in lipidic and about 60% in aqueous environment; in the latter
case, the SET mechanism also contributes ∼33% (the nuclear
reorganization energy: λ = 5.3 kcal/mol, kD = 8.00 × 109 M–1 s–1, kapp = 7.70 × 109 M–1 s–1) to the overall
rate constant. However, the SET mechanism has no contributions in
the overall rate constant in the nonpolar environment with the highest
ΔG⧧ (112.3 kcal/mol). These
results suggest that RAF is the main pathway for the hydroxyl radical
scavenging of antioxidant activity of I3C, also considering the activity
of indolyl radicals and radical cations.18,30−32 It is worth noticing that the reactions between C6(7,8)
with OH radical following the RAF mechanism have considerable contributions
(∼30%) in the overall rate constant in the polar solvent, whereas
these contributions in the nonpolar environment are minor (∼8%).
In contrast, the RAF reaction of C5 + OH in the lipid environment
has lower TS energy and ΔG⧧ values (Table 2)
compared to these figures for the rest of the carbon atoms of the
aromatic ring (C6, C7, and C8), resulting in high rate constants for
that reaction (kapp (C5–OH-RAF)
= 2.10 × 109 M–1 s–1) with a 27.1% contribution to the overall rate constant. On the
other hand, the HAT mechanism only plays a minor role in the hydroxyl
radical scavenging of I3C (∼3 and ∼4% contributions
in the overall rate constant in the polar and nonpolar media, respectively).
The results explain why is I3C a good antioxidant2,33 despite
the high BDE (X–H) (X = N, C, O) values (85.0–122.9
kcal/mol, Table 1).
Comparing with typical antioxidants such as Trolox (2.78 × 1010 M–1 s–1),13 glutathione (7.68 × 109 M–1 s–1),24 caffeine (2.15 × 109 M–1 s–1),14 edaravone (1.35 ×
1010 M–1 s–1),15 and melatonin (1.85 × 1010 M–1 s–1)16 in aqueous media, the reaction is faster than most and only slightly
slower than that of Trolox (1.3 times). In a lipid environment, I3C
can be considered one of the most active antioxidants, with an activity
comparable to dopamine (1.75 × 1010 M–1 s–1).17

Study of the
potential energy surfaces (Figure 3) indicated that there was a correlation
between the relative energies (ΔH°) of
the transition states and the rate constants. The lowest transition-state
TS energies were observed for the formation of TS-C2(C3)–OH-RAF
at −7.3 and −4.6 kcal/mol (relative to the separated
reactants) in the aqueous and lipid media, respectively. These are
the same moieties that yielded the highest values of rate constants
for the RAF mechanism (kapp (C2–OH)
= 2.70 × 109 and 2.40 × 109 M–1 s–1 in water and pentyl ethanoate,
respectively, whereas the diffusion-limited rate constants are kD = 2.7 × 109 M–1 s–1 in the studied environments). The highest
TS energies were observed for the formation of TS-C8–OH and
TS-C5–OH in polar and nonpolar solvents, respectively. These
reactions have the lowest rate constants (kTS-C8–OH = 2.12 × 105 M–1 s–1, kTS-C5–OH = 2.30 ×
104 M–1 s–1) and contribute
very little in the Γ (∼0%). It was found that the tunneling
corrections (κ) contribute significantly in the rate constants
of the HAT mechanism (κ = 1.8–20.0, Table 2), whereas those for the RAF
mechanism are only 1.0 and 1.2 in all of the studied media.

energy surfaces of the reaction between I3C and HO• in water (a) and pentyl ethanoate (b) by the HAT and

energies (ΔH°)].

The UV–vis spectra of the starting reactants (I3C),
the
main products [the products with branching ratios Γ > 1%
(Table 2)], and the
totals
of I3C and HO• radical reactions were computed in
aqueous and lipid media and are shown in Figure 4. The totals were achieved by the additivity
of the relative abundance and the absorbance of the formed products
with their branching ratios. As seen in Figure 4, the starting reagent, I3C has two bands,
the stronger at 214 and 217 nm and a weaker one at 263 and 262 nm
in aqueous and lipid environments, respectively. These results are
in good agreement with the experimental UV–vis spectra of I3C
observing bands at 217 and 277 nm.34 This
affirms that the UV–vis calculating method is reliable. The
observable spectrum, that is, the sum of the spectra of all products
(total—Figure 4) has two bands, the stronger at 312 nm and the weaker at 504 nm
in aqueous medium. This is also in good agreement with the reported
experimental spectra (peaks at 310 and 530 nm) by the reaction of
I3C and HO• radicals at pH 7.4 in aqueous solution.18 This agreement confirms that the calculated
results are correct and the main products of the hydroxyl radical
scavenging of I3C are I3C–C–OH-RAFs of C2–C8
(∼60%) and I3C+• (33.5%). Thus, the RAF mechanism
plays a deciding role in the HO• radical scavenging
of I3C in water. For the lipid environment, the main products are
formed by the RAF mechanism, that is I3C–C(2,3,5,8)–OH
(>94%). Thus, the sum of product spectra has two bands at 317 and
473 nm (Figure 4).

3 Conclusions
The hydroxyl radical scavenging of I3C was studied by thermochemical
and kinetic calculations. It was found that the overall reaction rate
constant of the HO• radical scavenging in water
is 2.30 × 1010 M–1 s–1 and approximately three times lower in pentyl ethanoate solvent
(7.74 × 109 M–1 s–1). The rate constant calculated in water is in good agreement with
reported experimental values. It was shown that the HO• radical scavenging is defined by the RAF mechanism (>94%) in
lipidic
environment, whereas in aqueous solution, the RAF is closer to about
60% and the SET contributes 33.5%. According to the calculations,
I3C is expected to exhibit antioxidant activity comparable to dopamine,
thus it holds the potential for use in preventing oxidative degradation
in lipid environments.

4 Computational Methods
M05-2X functionals with the solvation model density (SMD) were
used for kinetic calculations in both water and pentyl ethanoate solvents,
following the quantum mechanics-based test for the overall free radical
scavenging activity (QM-ORSA) protocol.13,20,35−38 The rate constant (k) was calculated
by using the conventional transition-state theory and 1 M standard
state as39−42  where σ is the reaction symmetry number
that represents reaction path degeneracy (which was calculated following
the literature43,44), κ accounts for tunneling
corrections which were calculated using the Eckart barrier,45kB and h are the Boltzmann and Planck constants, respectively, and ΔG⧧ is Gibbs free energy of activation of the studied
reaction. The SET reaction barriers were corrected by using the Marcus
Theory,46,47 whereas the Collins–Kimball theory
was used to calculate the apparent rate constants (kapp) in solvents.48 The diffusion
limit rate constant (kD) for an irreversible
bimolecular reaction was calculated according to the literature.13,49 To minimize over-penalizing entropy in solution, the corrections
proposed by Okuno50 were performed under
the consideration of the free volume theory following the Benson correction.13,51 The overall rate constant (koverall),
and branching ratios (Γ) were computed following the QM-ORSA
model.13

In this study, the lowest
electronic energy conformer for inclusion
in the analysis was obtained by hindered internal rotation treatment.52−54 The correction of transition states was confirmed by intrinsic coordinate
calculations and the presence of only one single imaginary frequency.

Here, the BDE, IE, and PA of the I3C–H moiety determines
the enthalpy of the following processes. 3   4   5  

The reaction enthalpies of
the individual steps of the radical
scavenging mechanism in the studied environments (at 298.15 K and
1 atm) were calculated as follows.55,56 6   7   8  

The enthalpy value
for the hydrogen atom in the solvent was calculated
at the same level of theory, whereas the calculated enthalpies of
the proton (H+) and electron (e–) were
taken from the literature.56−59 All calculations were performed with the Gaussian
09 suite of programs at the M05-2X/6-311++G(d,p) level.60 Kinetics were calculated by using the Eyringpy
program.61,62 The UV–vis absorption spectra were
calculated using the time-dependent DFT methodology, at the theoretical
level PBEO/6-311++G(d,p).63,64 Solvent effects on
the vertical excitation energies were considered by using the SMD
model.65
