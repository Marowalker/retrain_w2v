Nanoparticle-based
cellular probes are commonly designed via covalent
conjugation with affinity biomolecules. Those nanobioconjugates selectively
interact with cell surface receptors and induce endocytosis followed
by intracellular trafficking. However, this approach requires functional
modification of biomolecules that may alter their biochemical activity.
Here, we show that supramolecular host–guest chemistry can
be utilized as an alternative approach in nanoparticle functionalization
and selective cell labeling. We have used cyclodextrin-conjugated
quantum dots (QDs) for supramolecular host–guest interaction-based
functionalization with folate (QD-folate) and riboflavin (QD-riboflavin),
where cyclodextrin acts as a host for the folate/riboflavin guest.
We demonstrate that QD-folate and QD-riboflavin selectively label
cells that have over-expressed folate/riboflavin receptors and induce
the endocytosis pathway similar to covalently conjugated folate-/riboflavin-based
nanoprobes. However, labeling is highly sensitive to the molar ratio
of folate/riboflavin to cyclodextrin and incubation time. The presented
functionalization/labeling approach is unique as it does not require
covalent conjugation and may be extended for in vivo targeting application
via simultaneous delivery of host and guest molecules.

Introduction
Nanoparticles are widely
used as imaging probes, drug delivery
carriers, single-molecule tracking probes and theranostic agents.1−6 In these applications, nanoparticles are transformed into functional
nanoparticles or nanobioconjugates for selective targeting/labeling
of tissues, cells, and biomolecules.7−9 Usual functionalization
approaches involve covalent conjugation of nanoparticles with affinity
biomolecules such as vitamin, oligonucleotides, aptamers, peptides,
antibodies, and carbohydrates.7−9 Variety of bioconjugation reagents
along with conjugation protocols are now commercially available, which
are routinely exploited in deriving functional nanoparticles.7−10 However, there are few limitations in such a covalent conjugation
approach that include loss of biochemical activity of affinity biomolecules
because of covalent conjugation, specialized chemistry involved in
each type of functionalization, and difficulty in purification of
functionalized nanoprobes.7−10 Thus, research has been directed toward advanced
and alternative approaches of functionalization.11−15

Supramolecular host–guest interaction
can be viewed as a
unique alternative for functionalization as it does not involve any
covalent modification.16−24 In the host–guest interaction, the hydrophobic cavity of
cyclodextrin (CD), cucurbituril, and calixarene can incorporate guest
molecules (or a part of guest molecules) via noncovalent and weak
interactions.25−28 Such host–guest interaction has been successfully utilized
for functionalization of 2D surfaces,16,17 nanoparticles,19−24 cell membranes,18 and polymers/dendrimers.25−28 Moreover, such type of functional materials have been used in drug
delivery,26,28 biosensing,29−31 and other biomedical
applications.26 However, in all these host–guest
approaches, only selected host–guest molecules (e.g. CD–adamantane,
and CD–ferrocene) are used to produce stronger interactions.
In reality, many of the host–guest interactions are weak/reversible,
unstable in the presence of competitor molecules and difficult to
be utilized for biomedical applications.25−28 In particular, the reversible
host–guest interaction limits functionalization of polymers/nanoparticles
with vitamins/carbohydrates/peptides and shrinks the scope for selective
targeting/labeling applications under a complex bioenvironment. Here,
we demonstrate that the reversible host–guest interaction between
the CD host and the folate/riboflavin guest can be exploited for the
functionalization of nanoparticles and targeting cancer cells followed
by cellular endocytosis and subcellular trafficking. It is known that
folate and riboflavin receptors are over-expressed in several types
of cancer cells and their covalent conjugates with polymers/nanoparticles/CD
are used for targeting cancer cells.32−36 However, the host–guest interaction-based
functionalization of folate/riboflavins is not extensively utilized
in cell targeting, except in one report and without details of the
uptake mechanism.19 This is because of
weaker host–guest interaction as compared to CD–adamantane
or CD–ferrocene.37−39 Here, we show that quantum dots
(QDs) functionalized with folate/riboflavin via the host–guest
interaction can successfully label cells that have over-expressed
folate/riboflavin receptors and induce the endocytosis pathway similar
to nanoprobes that have covalently conjugated folate/riboflavin. However,
labeling is highly sensitive to the ratio of folate/riboflavin to
CD and incubation time.

Results
Synthesis of CD-Functionalized
QDs [QD(CD)70]
We have synthesized β-CD-functionalized
QDs with an average
number of 70 CD per QD (i.e. QD(CD)70) and used them in
deriving folate- and riboflavin-functionalized QDs (Scheme 1). Hydrophobic QDs are transformed
into polyacrylate-coated hydrophilic QDs with an average of 100 primary
amine groups per QD.11 In this coating,
four acrylates are used that include poly(ethylene glycol) methacrylate
that provides the pegylated surface, N-(3-aminopropyl)-methacrylamide
that introduces primary amine groups on the polymer shell, 3-sulfopropyl
methacrylate that introduces SO3– groups,
and bis[2-(methacryloyloxy)ethyl] phosphate that crosslinks the polymer
shell. In addition, four acrylates are used in appropriate molar ratios
to minimize particle–particle cross-linking. The primary amines
are estimated via the fluorescamine test; the QD concentration is
determined from their respective molar extinction coefficient40 and the QDs are designated as QD(NH2)100 as the number of primary amines per QD is ∼100
(Supporting Information, Figure S1). Next,
QD(NH2)100 is transformed into CD-functionalized
QDs by conjugating β-CD-NH2 using ethylene glycol-bis(succinic
acid-N-hydroxysuccinimide ester) (NHS-PEG-NHS) as
the conjugation reagent. Typically, β-CD-NH2 and
NHS-PEG-NHS are mixed in 1:1 molar ratio for reaction of the primary
amine of CD-NH2 with one NHS of NHS-PEG-NHS. Next, the
QD(NH2)100 solution is mixed with the excesses
(10 times of primary amines present in the QDs) of this solution and
under this condition other NHS of NHS-PEG-NHS react with primary amines
of QDs. Next, excesses of reagents are removed via dialysis (molecular
weight cut-off: 12 kDa) against fresh water. The amount of QD-bound
CD is estimated by the anthrone test, and the number of CD per QD
is estimated to be ∼70 and designated as QD(CD)70 (Figure 1 and Supporting Information, Figure S1). This number
of CD per QD has been further confirmed from the gel permeation chromatography
(GPC)-based molecular weight study and the fluorescamine test of QD(NH2)100 and QD(CD)70 (Figure 1). The GPC results show that
the molecular weight is increased by 90 kDa after the transformation
of QD(NH2)100 to QD(CD)70 which corresponds
to ∼70 CD. Estimation of primary amines (via fluorescamine
test) in QD(NH2)100 and QD(CD)70 also
corroborates this value (Supporting Information, Figure S1). The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image of
QD(CD)70 shows that the QD core is of 4–5 nm size,
the dynamic light scattering (DLS) study shows 15–25 nm hydrodynamic
size, and the zeta potential data show −10 to −20 mV
charge at pH 7.4 (Figure 1).

solution of QD(CD)70 under normal (left) and UV light (right).

Scheme 1 Synthetic Approach for the Preparation of QD(CD)70 from
QD(NH2)100 and Transformation into Folate-/Riboflavin-Functionalized
QDs via the Host–Guest Interaction
Hydrophilic
QD(NH2)100 is prepared from hydrophobic QD via
the polyacrylate
coating that has ∼100 average number of primary amines per
particle. Next, QD(NH2)100 is covalently conjugated
with β-CD-NH2 to produce QD(CD)70 that
has ∼70 average number of CDs per particle. Colloidal QD(CD)70 is incubated with varied concentrations of folate/riboflavin
to produce folate-/riboflavin-functionalized QDs (i.e. QD(folate)x and QD(riboflavin)x), where “x” denotes the average
number of folate/riboflavin per particle in the range of 1–35.

Host–Guest Chemistry-Based Synthesis
of Folate- and Riboflavin-Functionalized
QDs
Folate and riboflavin functionalization of QD(CD)70 is performed via the host–guest interaction using
folate/riboflavin as the guest for CDs. Typically, solution of folic
acid/riboflavin is mixed to the solution of QD(CD)70 and
incubated in water at room temperature overnight under dark condition.
The molar ratio of QD-bound CD to folate/riboflavin is varied in a
large range typically from 1 to 70 to optimize the functionalization.
Under this condition, folate/riboflavin is noncovalently incorporated
inside the hydrophobic cavity of CD. We have studied this host–guest
interaction using QD(CD)70 and compared with β-CD-NH2 (Figure 2 and Supporting Information, Figure S2). Host–guest
interaction leads to the increased absorption/emission band of folate/riboflavin,
similar to CD–folate39 and CD–riboflavin
systems.37,38 Folic acid and riboflavin make inclusion
complex by incorporating their hydrophobic part into the hydrophobic
cavity of β-CD. This fact restricts their vibrational rotation,
leading to significant increment in absorbance and fluorescence.38 Considering the reasonably high association
constant for this type host–guest complexation (in the order
of 105–106 M–1)37−39 and 1–70 molar ratio of CD to folate/riboflavin used it can
be assumed that most of the folate/riboflavin are bound to CD at the
10–50 molar ratio and some of them may be free at the 1–5
molar ratio. In addition, the number of folate/riboflavin bound on
each QD may vary from 1 to 35 as the molar ratio of CD to folate/riboflavin
is varied from 50 to 2. As the binding constant between CD and folate/riboflavin
is comparable to the used concentrations of folate/riboflavin (0.04–1.4
μM); we can assume that most of the folate/riboflavin bounds
with CD and the molar ratios of CD to folate/riboflavin provide the
tentative number of folate/riboflavin bound to each QD. In addition,
the folate/riboflavin concentration in human blood ranges from 0.040
to 0.150 μM, and thus, we may assume a similar situation under
in vitro/in vivo conditions.

Figure 2 (i) Evidence of the host–guest interaction
of folate with
β-CD (a) and QD(CD)70 (b). Same concentration of
folic acid is incubated with β-CD-NH2/QD(CD)70, where the molar ratio of folate to CD is maintained as
1:20, and then, the absorption/emission spectra of folate is measured.
Results show that the host–guest interaction leads to increased
absorbance at 360 and 280 nm and increased emission spectra at 455
nm. For the QD(CD)70 sample, QDs are dissolved by HCl followed
by neutralization with a base prior to spectral measurements. (ii)
Evidence of the host–guest interaction of riboflavin with β-CD
(a) and QD(CD)70 (b) Same concentration of riboflavin is
incubated with β-CD-NH2/QD(CD)70, where
the molar ratio of riboflavin to CD is maintained as 1:30, and then,
the absorption spectra of riboflavin is measured.

We have investigated that the fluorescence property of QDs
remains
stable in the presence of different biological substituents (Supporting Information, Table S1 and Figure S3).
In addition, we have investigated the effect of co-existing substances
in a complex biological environment and solution pH on the assembly
of the host–guest complex. An insignificant change in the fluorescence
intensity suggests that the host-guest complex is stable under a complex
bioenvironment (Supporting Information,
Table S1 and Figure S4).

Selective Labeling of Cancer Cells Using
Folate-/Riboflavin-Functionalized
QDs Prepared via Host–Guest Chemistry
We have extensively
studied the labeling performance of folate-/riboflavin-functionalized
QDs to cancer cells. We have selected KB cells that over-express folate
receptors as well as riboflavin receptors and A431 cells that over-express
riboflavin receptors. In addition, we have used Chinese hamster ovary
(CHO) cells as control cells that do not over-express folate or riboflavin
receptors. The results are summarized in Figures 3–7 and Supporting Information Figures S5–S9, which concludes
that folate-functionalized QDs can selectively label KB cells and
riboflavin-functionalized QDs can selectively label A431 and KB cells.
To confirm labeling selectivity, we have performed two control experiments.
First, QD(NH2)100 and QD(CD)70 are
used to label KB/A431 cells, and the results show that they cannot
label cells (Supporting Information, Figure
S5). This result is expected as the surface chemistry is appropriately
designed with extensive pegylation and overall anionic surface charge.
This result also indicates that folate/riboflavin functionalization
is necessary for cell labeling. Second, folate-/riboflavin-functionalized
QDs are used to label CHO cells that do not have over-expressed folate/riboflavin
receptors. The results show that CHO cells are not labeled by QD-folate
or QD-riboflavin, indicating that the uptake of QD requires folate/riboflavin
receptors on the cell surface (Supporting Information, Figures S6 and S7). In addition, two other control experiments
are performed where KB cells are incubated with a mixture of folate
and QD(NH2)100 or incubated with folate-functionalized
QDs prepared from γ-CD-functionalized QDs (Supporting Information, Figure S8). In all cases, insignificant
cell labeling are observed suggesting that nonspecific binding of
folate with QD(NH2)100 or poorly interacting
γ-CD host are unable to label cells.

Figure 3 Folate concentration-dependent
labeling of KB cells by QD(CD)70. Colloidal QD(CD)70 is incubated with varied
concentrations of folate, where the molar ratio of QD-bound CD to
folate is kept at 1 (a), 2 (b), 5 (c), 10 (d), 20 (e), 40 (f), and
70 (g). Next, the cells are incubated with QD samples for 3 h, and
the washed cells are used for bright field (BF) or fluorescence (F)
imaging. (h) Flow cytometry-based quantitative estimation of QD uptake.
About 20 000 cells are used for each experiment, and mean ±
SD represents three independent cell-culture replicates (n = 3). Results show that labeling performance is best for the CD
to folate molar ratio of 20. Scale bars are 50 μm (main figure)
and 25 μm (inset).

concentrations of riboflavin, where the molar ratio of QD-bound CD
to riboflavin is kept at 2 (a), 30 (b), and 50 (c). Next, the cells
are incubated with QD samples for 3 h, and the washed cells are used
for BF or F imaging. (d) Flow cytometry-based quantitative estimation
of QD uptake. About 20 000 cells are used for each experiment,
and mean ± SD represents three independent cell-culture replicates
(n = 3). Results show that labeling performance is
best for the CD to riboflavin molar ratio of 30. Scale bars are 50
μm (main figure) and 25 μm (inset).

Figure 5 Incubation time-dependent labeling and subcellular localization
of folate-functionalized QDs in KB cells. (a) Colloidal QD(CD)70 is incubated with folate, where the molar ratio of QD-bound
CD to folate is kept at 20. Next, the cells are incubated with the
QD sample for 1–9 h, and then, the washed cells are used for
fluorescence (F) imaging. Results show that QD uptake and subcellular
localization increase with increased incubation time, and the distinct
subcellular localization occurs at 9 h incubation. (b) Cells are treated
with the same QD sample as above but incubated for 3 h, and then,
the washed cells are further incubated with fresh media for 6 h followed
by washing and imaging. Results show that the labeled QDs detach from
the cell surface after incubation in fresh media. Scale bar represents
20 (a) and 50 μm (b).

Figure 6 Flow cytometry-based quantitative estimation of QD uptake in KB
(a,b) and A431 (c) cells. Colloidal QD(CD)70 is incubated
with folate, keeping the molar ratio of QD-bound CD to folate at 20
(a) or 40 (b). Similarly, colloidal QD(CD)70 is incubated
with riboflavin, keeping the molar ratio of QD-bound CD to riboflavin
at 30 (c). Next, the cells are incubated with endocytosis inhibitors
followed by incubation with the QD sample. Next, the washed cells
are used for flow cytometry analysis. Result shows that uptake of
both QD samples is significantly inhibited by MBCD and partially inhibited
by sucrose, which suggests for predominate lipid-raft and partial
clathrin-mediated endocytosis. The mean ± SD represents three
independent cell-culture replicates (n = 3).

QDs in KB cells
(a) and riboflavin-functionalized QDs in A431 cells (b) and KB cells
(c). Colloidal QD(CD)70 is incubated with folate, keeping
the molar ratio of QD-bound CD to folate at 20 for the preparation
of folate-functionalized QDs. Similarly, colloidal QD(CD)70 is incubated with riboflavin, keeping the molar ratio of QD-bound
CD to riboflavin at 30 for the preparation of riboflavin-functionalized
QD. Next, the cells are incubated with the QD sample for 9 h (for
folate-functionalized QDs in KB cells) or 3 h (for riboflavin-functionalized
QDs) in respective cells followed by incubation with nuclear probes
for 30 min, and the washed cells are used for imaging under BF or
F mode. Results show that QDs are localized in the perinuclear region
and concentrated at one side of the nucleus. Red color corresponds
to QDs and blue color corresponds to nuclear probes. Scale bar represents
50 μm.

Systematic labeling study
shows that there are two critical conditions
for cell labeling. First, the labeling is highly sensitive to the
molar ratio of QD-bound CD to folate/riboflavin (Figures 3 and 4 and Supporting Information, Figure S9).
We have used different sets of nanoprobes with the molar ratio of
QD-bound CD to folate/riboflavin and found that maximum labeling occurs
for the ratio of 20:1 (for folate) or 30:1 (for riboflavin). Under
this condition, each QD is expected to bind with 3 to 4 number of
folate/riboflavin (i.e. multivalency of 3 or 4). Labeling becomes
inefficient as this molar ratio is either increased or decreased.
Second, labeling and subcellular trafficking is highly sensitive to
incubation time and continuous incubation for longer time is essential
for efficient labeling (Figure 5 and Supporting Information, Figure
S10). For example, cellular uptake and subcellular localization of
QD are observed under continuous incubation for 1–9 h. By contrast,
if shorter incubation time is used followed by further cell growth
in fresh culture media, initially labeled QDs detach from the cell
surface (Figure 5).

We have quantitatively estimated the cell labeling of QD nanoprobes
via flow cytometry. The cells were incubated with QD samples and labeling
of QDs is quantified using the fluorescence property of QDs (Figure 3). The results clearly
show that labeling is sensitive to the molar ratio of QD-bound CD
to folate/riboflavin and highest for the molar ratio of 20/30 as shown
in Figures 3 and 4.

We have also investigated that addition
of folic acid in right
concentrations into cell culture media leads to the labeling of KB
cells by QD(CD)70, which is otherwise not possible (Supporting Information, Figure S11). This labeling
indicates host–guest complexation followed by cell labeling
occurring under a complex biological environment.

In another
control experiment, we have replaced CdSe/ZnS by Mn
doped ZnS (Mn–ZnS) and prepared riboflavin-functionalized Mn–ZnS
via host–guest chemistry.41 In this
system, Mn–ZnS and riboflavin can be tracked simultaneously,
as they have different excitation/emission. Labeled cells are imaged
under blue excitation for riboflavin imaging and imaged under UV excitation
for Mn–ZnS imaging and result show that Mn–ZnS and riboflavin
are co-localized. This result indicates that the host–guest
complex allows the entry of both the nanoparticle host and the riboflavin
guest into cells (Supporting Information, Figure S12).

Lipid-Raft Endocytosis and Subcellular Trafficking
of Folate-/Riboflavin-Functionalized
QDs
We have further investigated the uptake mechanism of
QDs using different endocytosis inhibitors. Cells are incubated with
folate/riboflavin free culture medium and inhibitors are added in
a required amount. Then, QD samples are added and incubated for another
1.5 h, and washed cells are used for flow cytometry-based quantification
of QD uptake. The results show that uptake of QDs differs in the presence
of inhibitors. In particular, the uptake of QD-folate and QD-riboflavin
is significantly inhibited by methyl-β-CD (MBCD) and partially
inhibited by sucrose (Figure 6). The results clearly suggest that the uptake of nanoprobes
occurs predominantly via lipid-raft and partially via clathrin-mediated
endocytosis.

We have also observed distinct subcellular localization
of QD-folate and QD-riboflavin (Figure 7 and Supporting Information, Figures S13–S15). When QD-folate/QD-riboflavin is incubated
with KB/A431 cells for 9–10 h, they are localized in the perinuclear
region and specifically concentrated at one side of the nucleus (Figure 7). High magnification
fluorescence images of cells labeled with both nuclear probes and
QD-riboflavin and at different Z planes show that
QDs localize at the same plane of the nucleus (Supporting Information, Figure S13). The colocalization study
with LysoTracker and Golgi tracker shows that QD-folate/QD-riboflavin
partially localizes at the Golgi apparatus and lysozome (Supporting Information, Figures S14 and S15).

It is well-known that the endocytosis uptake mechanism dictates
subcellular trafficking of foreign materials.42,43 Clathrin-mediated endocytosis usually traffics them to acidic lysosomal/endosomal
compartments but caveolae or lipid-raft mediated endocytosis usually
traffics them toward the nucleus, endoplasmic reticulum, and Golgi
apparatus.44,45 In particular, covalently attached
folate-functionalized nanoprobes are reported to enter into cells
via both caveolae- and clathrin-mediated endocytosis.46−48 Similarly, riboflavin-functionalized rhodamine is shown to enter
into cells via both caveolae- and clathrin-mediated endocytosis.49 We have recently shown that the zwitterionic–lipophilic
surface chemistry and <10 multivalency of nanoprobes can minimize
clathrin-mediated endocytosis and induce predominate caveolae- or
lipid-raft endocytosis.44,50 In the present case,
predominate lipid-raft endocytosis can be explained because of the
zwitterionic surface chemistry and 3/4 multivalency of folate-/riboflavin-functionalized
QDs that are prepared via the host–guest interaction. This
predominate lipid-raft endocytosis ensures their significant trafficking
toward the nucleus and Golgi apparatus. To show that these nanoprobes
are less toxic, we performed conventional methylthiazolyldiphenyl-tetrazolium
bromide (MTT) assay-based cytotoxicity study (Supporting Information, Figure S16). The results show that
our nanoprobes are less toxic in the concentration range used for
all experiments.

On the basis of our results, we propose the
cellular uptake mechanism
of folate-/riboflavin-functionalized nanoprobes that is prepared via
the host–guest interaction (Scheme 2). At lower folate/riboflavin concentrations,
all of them forms inclusion complexes with CD, directs the QD interaction
with folate/riboflavin receptors at the cell surface, induces endocytosis
of QDs, and trafficks QD toward the nucleus/Golgi apparatus. At higher
folate/riboflavin concentrations, their fraction is free for competitive
interactions with folate/riboflavin receptors at the cell surface
that restricts the QD endocytosis. Noncovalent/modular interaction
of folate/riboflavin with CD helps the easier replacement of their
position from CD to folate/riboflavin receptors. It is well-established
that the hydrophobic cavity of CD encapsulates the hydrophobic phenyl
ring of folate and the xylene part of the riboflavin. The remaining
parts of folate/riboflavin stay outside of the CD cavity.19,51 Also, it is reported that folate and riboflavin can interact with
the receptor proteins through the guanidine, hydroxyl groups, and
other hydrophobic groups as well.52,53 Considering
the comparable binding constant (∼104 M–1) of CD with riboflavin and tryptophan (through which the riboflavin
receptor binds with riboflavin),54 it may
be assumed that the receptors first bind with the parts of folate/riboflavin
which are outside the CD cavity and at the later stage uptaken through
equilibrium interactions.

Scheme 2 Proposed Endocytosis Mechanism of Folate-/Riboflavin-Functionalized
QDs Prepared via Supramolecular Host–Guest Chemistry
At lower folate/riboflavin concentrations,
all of them forms an inclusion complex with CD, directs the QD interaction
with folate/riboflavin receptors at the cell surface, induces lipid-raft
endocytosis of QDs, and traffics QDs toward the perinuclear region.
At higher folate/riboflavin concentrations, a significant fraction
of them are free for competitive interaction with folate/riboflavin
receptors and restrict QD endocytosis.

Conclusions
We have shown that supramolecular host–guest chemistry can
be utilized for functionalization of nanoparticles and targeting cancer
cells followed by cellular endocytosis and subcellular trafficking.
In particular, we have synthesized folate and riboflavin-functionalized
QDs using CD host and demonstrated their labeling and endocytotic
uptake into cancer cells with over-expressed folate/riboflavin receptors.
As folate and riboflavin receptors are over-expressed in several types
of cancer cells, this approach may be extended for in vivo targeting
application via simultaneous delivery of host and guest molecules.
In addition, the presented functionalization/labeling approach can
be extended to other types of host–guest molecules. Compared
to the well-known biotin–avidin interaction, a specific biological
host–guest interaction,55−57 this approach is more general
with modular interaction and may find wider application.

Synthesis of β-Cyclodextrin-Functionalized
QDs
Hydrophobic and red emissive CdSe/ZnS-based QDs were
synthesized
and made hydrophilic by using the previously reported polyacrylate
coating method.11,58 First, hydrophobic QDs were dissolved
in Igepal–cyclohexane reverse micelles. Next, 0.1 mL N-(3-aminopropyl)-methacrylamide hydrochloride (18 mg dissolved
in one mL water), 0.1 mL 3-sulfopropropyl methacrylate (228 mg dissolved
in one mL water), 0.1 mL poly(ethylene glycol) methacrylate (360 μL
dissolved in one mL water), and 100 μL bis[2-(methacryloyloxy)ethyl]phosphate
(60 μL dissolved in one mL water) were added. Next, polymerization
was initiated under nitrogen atmosphere with the addition of 0.1 mL
of persulfate solution (35 mg dissolved in one mL water). After 30
min of polymerization, QDs were precipitated by adding ethanol, and
the particles were washed repeatedly with chloroform and ethanol and
finally dissolved in water.

Functionalization with β-CD
was performed using NHS-PEG-NHS-based conjugation chemistry. Typically,
100 μL DMF solution of NHS-PEG-NHS (4.6 mg/mL) was mixed with
100 μL borate buffer solution (pH 9.0) of β-CD-NH2 (11.3 mg/mL). The mixture was shaken for 2–3 min,
and then, the whole solution was added to 1–2 mL QDs solution
and stirred for 4–5 h at room temperature. Next, the solution
was dialyzed against fresh water for 1 day and used as the stock solution.

Estimation of β-Cyclodextrin in Functionalized QDs
Detection and quantification of QD-bound β-CDs were performed
by the anthrone test.59 The anthrone test
was performed using different concentrations of β-CD-NH2. Typically, a stock solution of anthrone was prepared by
dissolving 4 mg anthrone in 2 mL of 80% sulfuric acid. Next, 150 μL
of β-CD-NH2 solution was added to it, heated in boiling
water bath for 10–15 min, and cooled in ice bath, and the absorbance
at 620 nm was measured. A linear calibration curve was obtained by
plotting the absorbance with respect to the concentration of β-CD-NH2. The linear equation was obtained as follows: Y = 2.5 × 104X + 0.1 with R2 = 0.99. (X = concentration
of β-CD-NH2 and Y = absorbance at
620 nm).

Similarly, the anthrone test was done using CD-functionalized
QDs, and the absorbance was measured at 620 nm and the amount of β-CD
is determined from the above-mentioned calibration graph. Separately,
the concentration of QDs in CD-functionalized QDs was measured by
using the QD absorbance at 573 nm.40 Next,
the number of CD per QD has been determined from the molar ratio of
CD and QDs, and the average value is 70 ± 5. This result was
further supported from the GPC-based molecular weight study. The molecular
weight of QD(NH2)100 was determined before and
after CD conjugation and increased molecular weight of 90 kDa was
accounted for ∼70 CD. Thus, the CD-functionalized QDs were
abbreviated as QD(CD)70.

Preparation of Folate-
and Riboflavin-Functionalized QDs via
the Host–Guest Interaction
Aqueous solutions of QD(CD)70 (with the CD concentration of 10–4 M),
DMF solution of folic acid (6 × 10–4 M) and
aqueous solution of riboflavin (10–4 M) were prepared
separately. Next, seven sets of QD(CD)70 were prepared
each having 1 mL solution. Next, 5–20 μL folic acid/riboflavin
solution was added to each sets such that the molar ratio of CD to
that of the folic acid/riboflavin was varied from 70 to 1. Solutions
of each set were stirred overnight and preserved at room temperature
under darkness. Similar types of sets were also prepared using QD(CD)70 but QD fluorescence was quenched by adding concentrated
HCl followed by neutralizing the solution with NaOH. Other control
sets were prepared using β-CD-NH2 instead of using
QD(CD)70.

Study of Host–Guest Complexation between
QD(CD)70 and Folic Acid/Riboflavin
First, seven
experimental sets
were prepared using QD(CD)70 (or β-CD-NH2), by varying the CD to folic acid molar ratio from 70 to 1. Next,
QD fluorescence was quenched by adding concentrated HCl followed by
neutralizing the solution with NaOH. Next, absorption spectra were
measured to note the absorbance value at 360 and 280 nm, and the emission
spectra were measured (with 370 nm excitation) to note the emission
intensity at 455 nm. Similarly, seven experimental sets were prepared
using QD(CD)70) (or β-CD-NH2), by varying
the CD to riboflavin molar ratio from 70 to 1. Next, QD fluorescence
was quenched by adding concentrated HCl followed by neutralizing the
solution with NaOH. Next, absorption spectra were measured to note
the absorbance of riboflavin at 445 and 370 nm.

Cell Labeling
Study
Here, in this experiment, KB cells
were used as folate and riboflavin receptor over-expressed cells and
A431 cells were used as riboflavin receptor over-expressed cells.
CHO was used as control cells that does not have over-expressed folate
or riboflavin receptors. Cells were cultured overnight in 24-well
plates before experiments. KB cells were cultured in folate-free RPMI-1640
(Invitrogen) with 10% heat-activated fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin
streptomycin at 37 °C and 5% CO2 atmosphere. A431
cells were cultured in riboflavin free F-12K (Invitrogen) medium,
and CHO cells were cultured in DMEM (Sigma), RPMI, and F-12K (Invitrogen)
media with all other conditions similar to the previous one. Next,
50–100 μL QD-folate/QD-riboflavin solution was added
followed by 1–9 h incubation. Next, the cells were washed with
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) buffer, and the images were taken
by adding fresh medium. The tentative concentration range of QDs,
CD, folate, and riboflavins used was 0.1–1.0, 7–70,
0.04–1.4, and 0.04–1.4 μM, respectively.

For the quantitative estimation of cellular uptake, we performed
flow cytometry-based study. Cells were separately incubated with QD(NH2)100, QD(CD)70, and folate-/riboflavin-functionalized
QDs for 3 h and washed with PBS buffer. Then, the cells were treated
with trypsin–ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) solution
to detach them from the plate. Finally, the detached cells were isolated
by centrifugation and redispersed in PBS buffer, and the emission
property of QDs under blue excitation is used for quantification.
About 20 000 cells were used in each experiment, and each experiment
is performed three independent cell-culture replicates.

Colocalization
Study
KB and A431 cells were cultured
in a four-well chamber slides for 24 h in their respective culture
media. Cells were incubated with QD-folate and QD-riboflavin for 9–10
h for cellular uptake. Next, cells were washed with PBS buffer, fresh
medium was added, and images were taken. Next, cells were incubated
with lysotracker red and Golgi tracker green for 30 min, and the washed
cells were used for the imaging study. Further cells were fixed using
4% paraformaldehyde, and the
fixed cells were used for imaging.

Endocytosis Inhibition
Study
To investigate the endocytosis
mechanism, cells were cultured in their respective media, pretreated
with different endocytosis inhibitors of appropriate concentrations
for 1 h, and finally incubated with QD-folate or QD-riboflavin samples
for 90 min. We have used MBCD to block the lipid-raft-mediated endocytosis
mechanism, genistein to block caveolae-mediated endocytosis, sucrose
to inhibit clathrin-mediated endocytosis, and amiloride to inhibit
macropinocytosis. Next, the cells were washed with PBS buffer to remove
unbound QD. Then, the cells were treated with trypsin–EDTA
solution to detach them from the plate. Finally, the detached cells
were isolated by centrifugion and dispersed in PBS buffer for the
flow cytometry study.

Cell Viability Assay
KB cells were
cultured in 24-well
plates in the cell culture medium. After that, cells were treated
with the QD sample for 24 h and then washed through PBS buffer, and
fresh DMEM medium was added. Then, 50 μL of freshly prepared
MTT solution (5 mg MTT in 1 mL deionized water) was added to each
well and incubated for 4–5 h. Next, the supernatant was removed
and formazon was dissolved in sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) solution
(8 g of SDS dissolved in 40 mL of DMF–H2O mixture),
and the absorbance was measured at 570 nm.

Instrumentation
UV–visible absorption spectral
studies were carried out with a Shimadzu UV-2550 spectrophotometer.
A Malvern Nano ZS instrument was used to measure the DLS size and
zeta potential. GPC (Waters 515) equipped with Waters HSP gel columns
was used for the determination of the molecular weight. The TEM study
was carried out on an FEI Tecnai G2 F20 microscope, fluorescence measurements
were performed using a Synergy Mx microplate reader (BioTek) and a
PerkinElmer LS 45, and fluorescence images of cells were captured
by using an Olympus IX 81 microscope using Image-Pro Plus 7.0 software.
Fluorescence-based quantification was studied using a BD Accuri C6
flow cytometer.
