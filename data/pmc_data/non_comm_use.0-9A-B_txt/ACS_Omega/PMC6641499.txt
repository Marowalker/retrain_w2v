The preparation of
quantum dot (QD)–sensitized photoanodes,
especially the deposition of QDs on TiO2 matrix, is usually
a time-extensive and performance-determinant step in the construction
of QD-sensitized solar cells (QDSCs). Herein, a transformative approach
for immobilizing QD on the TiO2 matrix was developed by
simply mixing the as-prepared oil-soluble QDs with TiO2 P25 particles suspension for a period as short as half a minute.
The solar paint was prepared by adding the TiO2/QD composite
in a binder solution under ultrasonication. The QD-sensitized photoanodes
were then obtained by simply brushing the solar paint on a fluorine-doped
tin oxide substrate followed by a low-temperature annealing at ambient
atmosphere. Sandwich-structured complete QDSCs were assembled with
the use of Cu2S/brass as counter electrode and polysulfide
redox couple as an electrolyte. The photovoltaic performance of the
resulting Zn–Cu–In–Se (ZCISe) QDSCs was evaluated
after primary optimization of the QD/TiO2 ratio as well
as the thicknesses of photoanode films. In this proof of concept with
a simple solar paint approach for photoanode films, an average power
conversion efficiency of 4.13% (Jsc =
11.11 mA/cm2, Voc = 0.590 V,
fill factor = 0.631) was obtained under standard irradiation condition.
This facile solar paint approach offers a simple and convenient approach
for QD-sensitized photoanodes in the construction of QDSCs.

Introduction
The development of
high-efficiency and low-cost photovoltaic cells
is an effective way to solve the increasing concerns on global warming
and the exhaustion of fossil fuels.1,2 Quantum dot–sensitized
solar cells (QDSCs) are considered as one of the promising third-generation
solar cells due to the excellent optoelectronic properties of QD light
absorbers, such as high absorption coefficient, tunable light-harvesting
range, high stability, and low-cost availability.2−6 Furthermore, due to the multiexciton generation possibility,
the theoretical maximum power conversion efficiency (PCE) of QDSCs
can go beyond the Shockley–Queisser limit and reach 44%.7,8 The structure of QDSCs is similar to that of dye-sensitized solar
cells with a light-harvesting material-sensitized photoanode, electrolyte,
and a counter electrode. In the photoanode, light-harvesting material
QDs are immobilized on nanocrystallite metal oxide (mainly TiO2) mesoporous films. The mesoporous film electrode plays a
crucial role in determining the performance of a cell device, such
as providing enormous surface areas for supporting enough amounts
of QD light absorbers, collecting and transmitting photogenerated
electrons, and allowing redox couple electrolyte penetrating into
the interior of the film to regenerate QD sensitizers.9 Usually, a series of time-consuming procedures are required
to get access to a well-performing photoanode. First, crystallite
TiO2 mesoporous film electrodes are prepared by coating
TiO2 paste on an optically transparent electrode (herein,
fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) conducting glass) substrate and following
a high-temperature sintering process.10,11 Then, QD sensitizers
are immobilized on the film electrode. This QD deposition step is
considered as a crucial and challenging step in determining the photovoltaic
performance of the resultant cell device.12−14

Currently,
two major routes, i.e., in situ growth, and postsynthesis
assembly with use of preprepared QDs, have been developed for the
immobilization of QDs on a mesoporous film electrode.13−27 For the first route, QDs are formed in situ on a mesoporous TiO2 film electrode starting from a solution containing the corresponding
cationic and anionic precursors for QDs.15−20 For the second one, the preprepared QDs are tethered on the film
electrode via direct adsorption, molecular linker-, or electrophoresis-assisted
assembly process.21−27 Benefiting from the feasible penetration of ionic precursors into
the nanoscaled channels of the mesoporous film electrode, in situ
growth route can result in an effective and high coverage of QD on
the electrode surface.28 However, the drawback
of this route is the high density of trap state defects and heterogeneous
size distribution of the formed QDs. These disadvantages limit the
photovoltaic performance of the resulting cell devices. In contrast,
the postsynthesis assembly route is favored by the high quality of
the preprepared QDs, but is shadowed by the low uploading amount of
QDs due to the relatively large size of QD particles.29−32 The deposition of QD sensitizers on the mesoporous film electrodes
has thus being a bottleneck in the development of high-efficiency
QDSCs.

To construct versatile and low-cost QDSCs, it is necessary
to simplify
the currently delicate and time-intensive preparation procedure for
photoanodes, especially the QD sensitization procedure. Unambiguously,
the invention that QD-sensitized photoanodes can be attained by simply
brushing a solar paint on a conductive substrate is a transformative
step in manufacturing QDSCs. This pioneering concept was tried by
Hodes and co-workers.33 They developed
a solar paint using CdSe, CdTe powder with a fluxing material such
as CdCl2, but the corresponding photovoltaic performance
was not obtained. Recently, Kamat and co-workers reported solar paints
for photoanode by simply mixing the commercially available TiO2 P25 powder with bulk CdS powder in water and t-butanol mixture solvent or depositing CdS (or CdSe) nanoparticles
on the suspended P25 particles by adsorption of Cd2+ and
S2– (or Se2–) ions alternatively.
The obtained highest PCE was 1.08% in their work.34 During the preparation of this article, Bang and co-workers
increased the highest PCE to 1.35% through this solar paint route
with use of PbS QDs as the light-harvesting material.35 However, all of these reported solar paint approaches to
fabricate the photoanode applied the successive ion layer absorption
and reaction method to deposit QDs on the TiO2 substrate.
As discussed above, this in situ growth method usually resulted in
the high density of trap state defects and heterogeneous size distribution
of the formed QDs, seriously deteriorating photovoltaic performance
of the cell devices. Thus, preparing solar paint with use of presynthesized
high-quality QDs owns a great potential to obtain high-efficiency
QDSC based on solar paint.

Herein, we target at simplifying
the preparation procedure of QD-sensitized
photoanode by simply brushing a solar paint on the FTO substrate,
followed by a low temperature annealing treatment at ambient atmosphere.
The solar paint was made from TiO2/QD composites, which
were obtained by direct adsorption of presynthesized oil-soluble QDs
on the TiO2 P25 suspension in a period as short as half
a minute. Less-toxic and environmental-benign Zn–Cu–In–Se
(ZCISe) QDs were selected as the model QD light absorber. An average
PCE of 4.13% was achieved in the resulting QDSCs with use of Cu2S/brass counter electrode.

Results and Discussion
Solar
Paint and Photoanode Preparation
In QDSCs, the
QD-sensitized photoanodes are normally prepared by tethering QD on
TiO2 nanocrystallite mesoporous films.15−27 On one hand, the adopted mesoporous structured film can enormously
enhance the surface face of the matrix for supporting much more QDs,
and therefore improving the light-harvesting capability; on the other
hand, the nanoscale channel throughout the film renders the QD deposition
process difficult and time-consuming. To overcome the disadvantage
of the conventional route in the preparation of photoanodes, herein
QD sensitizers are immobilized on the suspending TiO2 P25
particles to get the TiO2 particles supported QD composite
powder (noted as TiO2/QD hereafter). Then, the obtained
TiO2/QD powder is mixed with a binder solution to get the
so-called solar paint. From this solar paint, QD-sensitized photoanodes
could be feasibly obtained via a screen printing process. Scheme 1 illustrates the
preparation of QD-sensitized photoanodes with use of solar paint starting
from the TiO2/QD composite powder.

Scheme 1 Schematic Procedure
for the Preparation of QD-Sensitized Photoanodes
In the experiment, oleylamine (OAm) capped oil-soluble
ZCISe QD
light-harvesting materials with particle size of 4.1 nm and absorption
onset of 980 nm are first synthesized according to literature method.32,38 The corresponding optical spectra are available in Figure S1. Then, a fixed amount of P25 (0.5 g) suspension
in CH2Cl2 is mixed with ZCISe QD dispersion
in CH2Cl2 to get the TiO2/QD composite.
To get an optimal loading amount, the amount of QD used is varied.
Without the limitation of nanoscaled narrow channels, as encountered
in previously commonly used mesoporous film,15−27 in our case, both QD and P25 particles are suspended in the solution;
therefore, QDs could get access and tether on P25 particles from any
direction. As a result, the deposition of QD on P25 could be completed
in a period as less as 30 s. Meanwhile, a high loading amount of QD
on the P25 particles can also be obtained as discussed below. It is
highlighted that in this work the initial OAm-capped oil-soluble QDs
are used directly in this sensitization process. Due to the chemical
inertness of the long hydrocarbon chain in OAm ligand around QDs,
the deposition of oil-soluble QD on the conventional TiO2 film electrode is usually an extensively time-consuming process
with the deposition time up to several even to tens of hours, as well
as a low uploading amount.39−44

To avoid the degradation of ZCISe QDs at the following high-temperature
annealing process, a recipe for binder solution borrowed from the
paste suitable for conducting polymer substrate is adopted in the
preparation of solar paint in our case.36 In the experiment, solar paint is obtained by adding TiO2/QD powder to a poly(vinylidene difluoride) (PVDF) binder solution
under ultrasonication. The resulting thick, brown solar paint could
then be screen printed directly on FTO to obtain QD-sensitized photoanodes
after a low-temperature (120 °C) annealing process. TiO2/QD powder is obtained by direct adsorption of the initial oil-soluble
QD on the P25 particles suspension. The solar paint is then prepared
by mixing the obtained TiO2/QD powder with a PVDF binder
solution. Finally, the photoanodes are obtained by screen printing
the solar paint on the FTO substrate followed with a 120 °C annealing
procedure at ambient atmosphere for 1 h. It is noted that this low
annealing temperature cannot eliminate the PVDF completely, rendering
the PVDF to remain in the photoanode film. The insulating feature
of the PVDF in the intervals among neighboring TiO2 particles
hinders the photogenerated transportation among the TiO2 particles and decrease the photovoltaic performance accordingly.
Thus, the amount of PVDF in the solar paint is optimized, and it is
found that the addition of 20 mg PVDF gives the best photovoltaic
performance. The corresponding photovoltaic parameters of QDSCs prepared
with different amounts of PVDF in the solar paint are shown in Table S3. On the basis of these obtained photoanodes,
the sandwich-structured complete cells are assembled with the use
of Cu2S/brass counter electrode, and the corresponding
photovoltaic performances are evaluated.

Figure 1 shows the
absorption spectra of ZCISe QD-sensitized TiO2 film electrodes
derived from different amounts of ZCISe QDs used in the preparation
of TiO2/QD composite. It is found that with the increase
in the QD amount in the TiO2 suspension, the absorbance
in the resulting film electrode with identical thickness is improved
accordingly to reach a saturation value at the QD amount of 75.0 mg.
This indicates that the increase in QD loading on the TiO2 particles is translated into the enhancement of loading amount on
the final film electrode. For convenience, the used QD amount in the
TiO2 suspension is used to distinguish the loading amount
in film electrodes hereafter. The increase in absorbance in the photoanode
film indicates the enhancement of QD loading amount on the TiO2 particles, and also the improvement of the light-harvesting
capacity of the film electrode. The enhancement of QD loading amount
of P25 can also be reflected by the deepening of the photograph color
of the film electrode, as shown in the inset of Figure 1. Similar to the case of the absorption spectra
from the QD dispersion in CH2Cl2 (Figure S1), the light absorption range for the
resulting photoanodes covers the whole visible spectrum and expands
to the near-infrared window with the longest wavelength extending
to near 1000 nm. This excellent light-harvesting capacity paves the
way for achieving an outstanding photovoltaic performance of the resulting
cell devices as discussed below.

to different contents of ZCISe QDs in the TiO2 suspension.

Figure 2a shows
the transition electron microscopy (TEM) images of ZCISe QDs-sensitized
TiO2 film electrodes. From the TEM images, it can be seen
that the surface of P25 particles (about 20–50 nm) is covered
densely by smaller spherical particles (ZCISe QD, about 4 nm). This
gives a visual evidence for the uniform distribution of QDs onto the
P25 particles. Figure 2b shows the cross-sectional field emission scanning electron microscopy
(SEM) images of ZCISe QDs-sensitized TiO2 film electrode
with the film thickness of 12 μm. From the high-magnification
SEM images in Figure 2c, it can be seen that the TiO2 film electrodes are composed
of numerous mesoporous, which allows the fluent diffusion of electrolyte
solution.45

Photovoltaic Performance
To suppress
the charge recombination
loss at the photoanode/electrolyte interfaces in assembled cell devices,
a thin passivation layer of ZnS is overcoated around the surface of
photoanodes, as done in a standard QDSC.44,46 The treated photoanodes are assembled into a sandwich-type QDSC
device with the use of Cu2S/brass counter electrode and
polysulfide redox electrolyte. To minimize the measurement deviation,
at least five devices are prepared and tested in parallel. To obtain
higher efficiency of QDSCs, we investigate systematically the influence
of a series of experimental variables, including the amount of QDs
used in TiO2 suspension for the preparation of TiO2/QD composite, and the film thickness.

Figure 3a shows the photocurrent–voltage
(J–V) curves of cells under
the irradiation of 1 full sun intensity based on different amounts
of QDs in the preparation of TiO2/QD composite powder.
The measured short-circuit current density Jsc values (9.19–11.11 mA/cm2) are consistent
with the integrated current density (8.95–10.84 mA/cm2) based on incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) spectra in Figure 3b. Photovoltaic parameters
(Voc, Jsc,
fill factor (FF), and PCE) that are obtained from the J–V curves are listed in Table 1. The individual photovoltaic
parameters of each tested cell based on the solar paint containing
different amounts of QDs are listed in Table S1. When the amount of QDs in the TiO2 suspension is increased
from 45.0 to 75.0 mg, the Voc, Jsc, and PCE values are increased systematically,
whereas the FF values are kept nearly constant. With further increase
in the QD amount, the photovoltaic performance is kept at a plateau
value. It is noted that the unabsorbed free QDs could be reused, and
this accords with the concept of “green” chemistry.
What is more, this method is demonstrated to be beneficial for the
fabrication of larger-sized device. We have constructed the cells
with a larger active area of 1.0 cm2 and an average PCE
of 3.83% was obtained, which is comparable with that of the small-sized
cells. The detailed photovoltaic parameters are shown in Table S4.

The relatively low efficiency obtained in this work
can be attributed
to the low Jsc value. This work highlights
a facile approach to prepare the QD-sensitized photoanode in
QDSCs using a solar paint and without a need of high-temperature treatment.
Nevertheless, the thickness of the photoanode film is limited in this
method, which will be discussed in the following sections. What is
more, the residual PVDF in the film arising from the low annealing
temperature for the preparation of film electrodes also leads to the
relatively low Jsc values.

Electrochemical
Impedance Spectroscopy
To unveil the
inherent mechanism for the dependence of photovoltaic performance
on the amounts of QDs used in the preparation of TiO2/QD
composite, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is employed.
All of the cell samples are measured at different forward biases (from
−0.2 to −0.6 V) under darkness. The corresponding parameters
of EIS are obtained relying on the standard equivalent circuit model.47,48Figure 4a–c
shows the applied forward bias voltage (Vapp) dependent chemical capacitance (Cμ), recombination resistance (Rrec), and
dark current. The similar Cμ values
(Figure 4a) of all
of the cells illustrate that different QD loading amounts did not
change the state of the conduction band or the distribution of traps
states of the TiO2 substrate. However, with the increase
in the loading amount, the Rrec values
(Figure 4b) are improved
gradually. It is well known that the charge recombination rate occurring
at the photoanode/electrolyte interfaces is inversely proportional
to the Rrec value.49,50 With the increase in the QD loading amount, a higher surface coverage
for the TiO2 matrix is achieved, and the surface areas
exposed directly to the electrolyte solution is decreased.9 It is noted that the uncovered TiO2 surface could act as a recombination center for the capture of photogenerated
electron by the oxidized species (i.e., Sn2–) in the electrolyte.51,52 Therefore, the improvement in surface coverage favored the suppression
of charge recombination process occurring at photoanode/electrolyte
interfaces and brought forward the enhancement of photovoltaic performance
of the resultant cell devices. Furthermore, the dependence of dark
current on Vapp as shown in Figure 4c gives further support for
the suppressed charge recombination rate with the increase in the
QD loading amount. To distinguish the recombination difference of
cells based on different QD loading amounts, Figure 4d shows the Nyquist plots of the corresponding
cells under the forward bias near the Voc value. The observed greater diameter for the semicircles corresponding
to larger QD loading amount indicates a greater charge recombination
resistance. Overall, the EIS results indicate that the charge recombination
occurring at TiO2/QDs/electrolyte interfaces is inhibited
with an increase in the loading amount of QD on the TiO2 particles. The EIS results are in well-accordance with the results
from the J–V measurements
as shown in Table 1 and Figure 3.

of ZCISe QDs in the TiO2 suspension: (a) chemical capacitance Cμ; (b) recombination resistance Rrec; (c) dark current on corrected voltage Vapp; (d) Nyquist plots at the forward bias of
−0.6 V.

Open-Circuit Voltage Decay
To illustrate further the
performance difference of the cells based on different amounts of
QDs in film electrodes, the open-circuit voltage decay (OCVD) measurement
is used to analyze the electron recombination processes. A white light-emitting
diode of 100 mW/cm2 continuously illuminates on the studied
cell to get to a stable voltage, and then the open-circuit voltage
decay information is recorded after switching off the light.53,54 As shown in Figure 5a, it can be seen that the rate of voltage decay becomes slower by
increasing the amount of QDs. The electron lifetime (τn) can be visually reflected by the open-circuit
voltage decay curves. Figure 5b shows the electron lifetime, which can be calculated using
the equation τn = −(kBT/e)(dVoc/dt)−1,
where kB, T, and e are the Boltzmann constant, the absolute temperature (298
K), and the electronic charge, respectively.45 From Figure 5, it
is obvious that the solar cells based on a higher QD loading amount
correspond to a longer electron lifetime related to those with a lesser
QD loading amount at the identical potential, indicating that the
charge recombination process is retarded by the increasing QD loading
amount. This observation is consistent with that observed in the EIS
measurement, and therefore gives further evidence for the obtained
better photovoltaic performance as observed from the J–V measurements.

corresponding to different contents of
ZCISe QDs in the TiO2 suspension. (b) Electron lifetime

Effect of Film Thickness on Photovoltaic Performance
In
addition to the different amounts of QDs in the solar paint, the
mesoporous film thickness of a photoanode is another important parameter
in determining the performance of the resulting cell devices. In a
certain range, a thicker film can enhance the light absorption capacity
and thus improve the photocurrent, whereas it will increase the possibility
of a charge recombination simultaneously.55 In the experiment for optimizing film thickness, the amounts of
QDs and PVDF in the solar paint is kept at an optimum value. The J–V and IPCE curves for champion
cells under variable film thickness are shown in Figure 6. As shown in Table 2, the average photovoltaic performances
(Voc, Jsc,
FF, and PCE) are improved with the increase in the film thickness
from 9 to 12 μm. The individual photovoltaic parameters of each
tested cell with different film thickness are displayed in Table S2. We can see that the improved PCE is
mainly derived from the increased Jsc.
When the film thickness is increased furthermore from 12 to 15 μm, Voc, Jsc, and PCE
are decreased; however, the FF is increased. This demonstrates that
the photovoltaic performance of the resulting cell device could not
be improved by just monotonously increasing the thickness of the photoanode
film. Furthermore, our experiment results indicate that the strength
of the photoanode film is sacrificed with an increase in the thickness
of the film, and the resulting thick film is easier to fall off from
the FTO glass substrate. Our experimental results indicate that the
thickness of 12 μm is the optimized value in consideration of
both photovoltaic performance and device stability.

Conclusions
In summary, a transformative
approach for the preparation of QD-sensitized
photoanode in QDSCs was developed by simply brushing a solar paint
on the FTO conductive glass. The solar paint was derived from the
TiO2/QD composite, which can be obtained in a time period
as short as half minute by mixing the initial oil-soluble QDs and
TiO2 P25 suspension. Obviously, this approach can simplify
the preparation process of QD-sensitized photoanodes, especially the
QD sensitization step, and, therefore, speed up the industrialization
process of QDSCs. An average PCE of 4.13% (Voc = 0.590 V, Jsc = 11.11 mA/cm2, FF = 0.631) was achieved on ZCISe QDSCs prepared through
this solar paint approach. Further optimization of the solar paint
composition and other components of the device are necessary to boost
further the performance of the resultant cell devices.

treatment.

Preparation of Solar Paint and Fabrication
of Solar Cells
The procedure and all of the chemicals used
for the preparation
of oil-soluble ZCISe QDs were identical to previous report.32 The TiO2/QD composites were obtained
by simply mixing the as-prepared oil-soluble QDs with TiO2 P25 nanoparticles suspension in the dichloromethane medium. Typically,
10.0 mL of P25 suspension in dichloromethane (containing 0.5 g of
P25) was mixed with an equal volume of as-prepared ZCISe QD dispersion
in dichloromethane (containing 75.0 mg of ZCISe QDs), and the resulting
mixture was subjected to sonication for 30 s to complete the process
of adsorption of QDs on the surface of TiO2 particles.
The TiO2/QDs powder was collected via a centrifugation/precipitation
process for twice to get rid of the unattached free-dispersion QDs
in solution. The powder product was then dried under hot air with
typical yields of 0.571 g.

Binder solution for the following
solar paint was prepared according to standard literature method.36 In the procedure for solar paint preparation,
the obtained TiO2/QD powder (0.571 g), 1.0 mL as-prepared
binder solution were loaded to a mixture containing 6.0 mL of anhydrous
ethanol and 100 μL of TiO2-sol in a 50 mL round-bottom
flask and then sonicated for 10 min. The solar paint was obtained
by the removal of redundant ethanol from this mixture through a rotary
evaporation process.

The photoanode film were fabricated by
screen-printing the obtained
solar paint on a FTO glass (8 Ω/sq) and then sintered at 120
°C for 60 min in a muffle-type furnace at ambient atmosphere.
The sandwich-type cells were fabricated by assembling the Cu2S/brass counter electrode and the photoanode film using a scotch
spacer (50 μm). Modified polysulfide aqueous solution containing
2.0 M of S, 2.0 M Na2S, and 20 wt % poly(vinyl pyrrolidone)
was used as redox electrolyte.37

Characterization
The morphology of the photoanode film
was studied by a Hitachi S4800 SEM. The TEM images were obtained on
a JEOL JEM-2100 instrument with an operation voltage of 200 kV. The
absorption spectra of the photoanode film were measured on a Shimadzu
UV-2600 spectrometer. The Keithley 2000 multimeter with illumination
from a 300 W tungsten lamp with a Spectral Product DK240 monochromator
was used to measure IPCE curves. The J–V characteristics of the cell devices were recorded on a
Keithley 2400 source meter under illumination of simulated AM 1.5G
solar light (Oriel, model no. 94022A). A NREL standard silicon solar
cell was used to calibrate the light intensity before each measurement.
The photoactive area was determined by a black metal mask of 0.237
cm2. OCVD and EIS were obtained using an electrochemical
workstation (Zahner, Zennium).
