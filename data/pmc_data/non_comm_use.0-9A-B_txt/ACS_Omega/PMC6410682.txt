Pyrvinium
was identified as the first small molecule inhibitor
of the androgen receptor (AR) DNA-binding domain (DBD). It was also
among the first small molecules shown to directly inhibit the activity
of AR splice variants (ARVs), which has important clinical implications
in the treatment of castration-resistant prostate cancer. Important
questions about pyrvinium’s mechanism of action remain. Here,
we demonstrate through mutational analysis that amino acids 609 and
612 are important for pyrvinium action. Nuclear magnetic resonance
demonstrates a specific interaction between a soluble pyrvinium derivative
and the AR DBD homodimer–DNA complex. Chromatin immunoprecipitation
and electrophoretic mobility shift assay experiments demonstrate that,
despite an interaction with this complex, pyrvinium does not alter
the DNA-binding kinetics in either assay. AR immunoprecipitation followed
by mass spectrometry was used to identify proteins whose interaction
with AR is altered by pyrvinium. Several splicing factors, including
DDX17, had reduced interactions with AR in the presence of pyrvinium.
RNA sequencing of prostate cancer cells treated with pyrvinium demonstrated
changes in splicing, as well as in several other pathways. However,
pyrvinium did not alter the levels of ARVs in several prostate cancer
cell lines. Taken together, our new data pinpoint the direct interaction
between pyrvinium and AR DBD and shed light on the mechanism by which
it inhibits AR transcriptional activity.

==== Body
Introduction
Despite the approval
of several new agents to treat metastatic
prostate cancer following the development of castration resistance,
the disease remains incurable, and prostate cancer is still the second
leading cause of cancer death in men in the United States.1 It is now well-established that sustained androgen
receptor (AR) activity is a key mechanism driving resistance in castration-resistant
prostate cancer, despite the castrate levels of serum androgens.2 To address this resistance, several novel compounds
have been developed that target the AR signaling pathway, including
the FDA-approved drugs abiraterone3 and
enzalutamide,4 as well as others in clinical
development, including galeterone5 and
ARN-509.6 Despite promising responses to
these agents in many men, none appear to be curative, and both de
novo and acquired resistance to these drugs are widespread. Although
there is evidence of an increase of truly AR-independent cancers that
arise following multiple lines of hormonal therapy,6 there is also strong evidence that a significant fraction
of prostate tumors treated with next-generation androgen/AR-directed
therapies continue to demonstrate a molecular signature consistent
with continued AR signaling.7 Furthermore,
the majority of men who progress on abiraterone and enzalutamide have
rising prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels, strongly suggesting
that these tumors remain AR-driven.4,8

Several
mechanisms have been proposed to account for continued
AR signaling in the setting of advanced AR targeting. Point mutations
in the AR ligand-binding domain (LBD) have been identified that confer
resistance to abiraterone9 and enzalutamide.10 Likewise, the expression of AR splice variants
(ARVs) has been documented to mediate resistance to abiraterone and
enzalutamide.11 ARVs are truncated AR isoforms
that lack LBD but retain the N-terminal domain (NTD) and DNA-binding
domain (DBD) and are thus constitutively active even in the absence
of ligands. Many ARV species have been found in clinical samples,
and the presence of ARVs, ARV-7 in particular, has been correlated
with a poor response to abiraterone and enzalutamide in several clinical
studies (for review, see ref (11)). Although not as well-studied in a clinical setting, several
signaling pathways have been shown to activate AR signaling in the
absence of ligands in prostate cancer models, including HER2, IL-6,
and others (for review, see ref (12)). The majority of these pathways are proposed
to activate AR through its NTD, either by direct interactions or by
post-translational modifications. It has also been proposed that in
some cancers, the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) can replace AR and
drive the expression of AR target genes.13 GR and AR have highly homologous DBDs and have very similar preferences
for DNA-binding sites; so, it is very plausible that GR could bind
to and activate AR target genes. These mechanisms are not necessarily
mutually exclusive, and each could play a role in different subsets
of cancers to contribute to the “AR-active” molecular
signature observed in many cancers resistant to next-generation hormonal
therapies. Regardless of the mechanism at play, it is clear that the
continued expression of AR target genes is driving much of the resistance,
and new therapies are necessary to treat these cancers.

We identified
pyrvinium pamoate (PP) in a screen for noncompetitive
AR inhibitors14 and subsequently found
it to be the first bona fide AR inhibitor that functions via the AR
DBD.15 We have previously demonstrated
that (1) pyrvinium is the active component of the compound, (2) it
functions synergistically with competitive antagonists, (3) it does
not degrade AR, (4) it does not prevent nuclear translocation, (5)
it does not prevent AR DNA binding, but (6) it does prevent RNA pol
II recruitment to the transcription start sites.16 We have also demonstrated that PP interacts with AR and
prevents its proteolysis.15 The AR mutants
lacking the NTD or LBD are sensitive to PP, but those lacking the
DBD are insensitive to PP, strongly suggesting that PP functions via
the DBD. This is important as PP is able to inhibit the constitutive
activity of clinically relevant ARVs.15 Interestingly, AR inhibition is cell type and tissue selective,
and PP can inhibit the activity of GR and several other nuclear receptors
with varying potency in prostate cancer cells.15 In this study, we confirm a biophysical interaction between
a soluble pyrvinium derivative and the AR DBD–DNA complex using
nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and pinpoint the AR DBD residues
that mediate the interaction with pyrvinium by mutational analysis.
We further explore the mechanism of PP inhibition of AR activity using
unbiased proteomic and transcriptomic approaches and find that the
reduced interaction with splicing proteins may contribute to PP’s
activity.

Results and Discussion
Pyrvinium Binds the AR DBD–DNA Complex
Our previous
work demonstrated that pyrvinium functioned to inhibit AR activity
via the DBD, and our computer modeling predicted interactions with
amino acids K609, N610, and P612.15 We
therefore created alanine mutations of these three residues and tested
the ability of pyrvinium to inhibit the transcriptional activity of
these AR mutants in a luciferase reporter assay (Figure 1A). PP inhibited the activity
of the N610 AR mutant nearly as potently as it inhibited the wild-type
AR, but the other two mutants were resistant to PP inhibition, suggesting
that K609 and P612 are critical contacts for pyrvinium action. We
next sought biophysical evidence of pyrvinium interaction with the
AR DBD–DNA complex using both crystallography and NMR approaches.
As both techniques are more feasible with compounds that are soluble
in aqueous solutions and pyrvinium is not, we endeavored on a small
medicinal chemistry undertaking (to be described in a later publication)
to develop a soluble pyrvinium derivative. We arrived at one such
compound, P24, which had nearly an equivalent potency to pyrvinium
(Figure S1A) but was readily soluble in
aqueous solutions. Using a standard crystallography screen, the reddish
P24 compound was found to be present in the crystals of purified AR
DBD in complex with the ADR3 DNA element,17 as evidenced by the reddish color of the treated crystals (Figure S1B); however, repeated attempts to obtain
interpretable spectra from various crystal preparations, even those
without P24, failed. NMR, however, provided strong evidence of a physical
interaction between P24 and the AR DBD–ADR3 DNA complex. When
AR DBD was added to DNA duplex, the heteronuclear single quantum coherence
(HSQC) spectrum of AR DBD changed dramatically accompanied with line
broadening (Figure 1B,C). This confirmed the formation of a complex between AR DBD and
the DNA duplex. Some cross-peaks of free AR DBD disappeared completely,
which indicated that no free AR DBD was detectable with the existence
of 30% excess of DNA. When P24 was added to the AR DBD and DNA complex,
chemical shifts of most AR DBD peaks were not affected, except that
more than 20 peaks disappeared (Figure 1D). These changes are shown more clearly in Figure 1E, which is the zoomed-in
overlay of Figure 1C,D. This suggested that some residues of AR DBD interact with P24
when AR DBD is bound to DNA. The interaction between P24 and AR DBD
bound to DNA did not break the complex between the protein and DNA
duplex as the HSQC spectra in Figure 1C,D are very similar but different from the HSQC spectrum
of free AR DBD, as shown in Figure 1B. When P24 was added to the AR DBD protein without
DNA, no chemical shift was observed, even up to a 4:1 molar ratio
of P24:AR DBD (Figure S1C). This result
suggested that P24 does not interact with AR DBD in the absence of
DNA. On the basis of the dynamics of the band shifts, the affinity
constant of P24 of the DBD–DNA complex is predicted to be 30–300
nM, which is in line with the IC50 of P24 in the luciferase
reporter assay (Figure S1A). The HSQC spectra
suggest that P24 neither blocks the formation of the protein–DNA
complex, nor does it break or reverse the formed complex. To further
investigate this, we added P24 to the protein and DNA separately before
adding the protein to DNA to form the protein–DNA complex.
The HSQC spectrum acquired on the protein–DNA complex prepared
this way is identical to that with the addition of P24 after the formation
of the protein–DNA complex. This is in line with our computer
modeling showing that the pyrvinium pharmacophore interacts with the
DBD–DNA complex.15

activity was quantified in quadruplicate samples. PP inhibits the

Effect of Pyrvinium on DNA Binding
Because pyrvinium
interacts with the AR DBD–DNA complex, we investigated if pyrvinium
alters the DNA-binding parameters using chromatin immunoprecipitation
(ChIP) and electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) approaches.
We had previously observed that PP did not prevent the dihydrotestosterone
(DHT)-induced binding of AR to a panel of AR-binding sites (ARBSs)
after 4 h of treatment.16 As computer modeling
suggests that PP interacts with both the protein and DNA, we hypothesized
that PP might “lock” the protein on the DNA, altering
the on/off rate which could lead to a reduced transcriptional activity.
Therefore, we treated LNCaP cells with DHT, PP, and/or enzalutamide
for 4 h. To perform a washout experiment, we also treated cells as
above but removed the media containing drugs and replaced with drug-free
media for 90 min prior to the ChIP assay. In a preliminary experiment,
we found that removing DHT causes a decrease of AR binding at most
sites between 0.5 and 2 h. We therefore examined AR binding at two
previously identified ARBSs18 after a 1.5
h washout. We confirmed our previous finding that PP does not reduce
AR binding to DNA as detected by ChIP16 and further found that PP treatment does not prevent the loss of
AR binding upon withdrawal of DHT (Figure 2A). To more directly quantify the effect
on the affinity of AR for DNA, we performed EMSAs using the soluble
derivative P24. We used a minimal fragment of AR comprising the DBD
(residues 557–647) and a 23 bp DNA probe containing a high
affinity site (GTACGGAACAAAATGTACTGTAC). We then incubated twofold
dilutions of AR DBD (starting at 5 μM) with DNA (at 5 nM) in
the absence and presence of two P24 concentrations (300 nM and 100
μM). Under these conditions, we found that the affinity of AR
DBD for the site was Kd = 29.6 and that
the addition of P24 did not significantly lower the affinity (Kd = 34.7 and Kd =
35.3). Thus, we conclude that the addition of P24 does not have a
significant effect on the affinity of AR DBD for specific DNA binding.

Figure 2 Effect
of pyrvinium on DNA binding. (A) LNCaP cells were treated
as indicated for 4 h with or without a 1.5 h drug washout, at which
point cells were fixed and AR ChIP was performed. DHT causes enrichment
of AR at two previously identified ARBSs, which are not blocked by
PP. Drug washout reduces AR occupancy at these binding sites and PP
does not retain AR at the ARBSs. (B,C) EMSAs were used to measure
the affinity of AR DBD for a specific AR-binding sequence in the presence
of the control vehicle BCD or P24. The shifted band represents an
AR DBD dimer bound to DNA. Although the affinity of AR DBD for DNA
is slightly reduced in the presence of two different concentrations
of P24, the effect is not significant (p = 0.24 or
0.16).

IP–Mass Spectrometry
To Identify AR-Binding Proteins
Affected by Pyrvinium
Although pyrvinium interacts with AR
DBD, it does not alter the AR interaction with DNA, leading to the
question as to how it prevents the transcriptional activity of AR.
We previously demonstrated that pyrvinium reduces the interaction
between RNA pol II and AR by western blot and that it reduces the
amount of RNA pol II at the KLK3 transcription start site, as determined
by ChIP.16 To identify the additional factors
that could contribute to the loss of AR transcriptional activity,
LNCaP cells were treated with DHT ± PP. The cells were lysed,
AR was immunoprecipitated, and the proteins were resolved by sodium
dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). Sections
from a Coomassie-stained gel were isolated and prepared for mass spectrometry
(MS) analysis (Figure 3A). Western blotting demonstrated the specificity of the AR pull-down
and confirmed that PP reduced the AR interaction with RNA pol II (Figure 3A). A semiquantitative
analysis of protein levels was accomplished by comparison to a known
amount of standard spiked into each sample. Among the proteins that
were identified in the cells treated with DHT only but not in the
DHT + PP-treated cells were two DEAD box proteins, DDX5 and DDX17,
also known as p68 and p72. These proteins are RNA helicases known
to be involved in splicing19−21 and have been identified as coregulators
for AR and other nuclear receptors.22−25 We first confirmed the altered
association between AR and these proteins by IP followed by western
blot (Figure 3B). We
found that the presence of PP reduced the interaction between DDX17
and AR in a co-IP more so than it did in the interaction between DDX5
and AR. We tested whether the overexpression of DDX17 could rescue
the AR inhibition caused by PP treatment. Indeed, when DDX17 was overexpressed
by ∼twofold [as measured by reverse transcription (RT)–quantitative
polymerase chain reaction (qPCR)], we found that the expression of
the androgen-responsive gene FKBP5 was not as potently inhibited by
PP in LNCaP or LAPC4 cells (Figure 3C,D). This suggests that DDX17, at least in part, mediates
the response to PP in these two prostate cancer cell lines.

(A) LNCaP cells were treated with 1 nM DHT ± 100 nM PP (indicated
by a “–“ or “+” adjacent to “PP”.
Cells were lysed, AR was immunoprecipitated and proteins resolved
by SDS-PAGE. Sections from a Coomassie-stained gel were isolated and
prepared for MS analysis. A western blot was also performed to demonstrate
the specificity for AR pull-down and PP activity, as it is known to
block the interaction with RNA pol II. The table indicates the arbitrary
score from each lane for the detection of AR and DDX proteins, with
approximate mass. (B) To confirm the loss of DDX protein binding,
LNCaP cells were treated with vehicle, DHT, or DHT + PP for 24 h,
at which point the cells were lysed and AR was immunoprecipitated.

RNA was harvested. qPCR demonstrated a decrease in the efficacy of
PP to inhibit the transcription of the AR target gene FKBP5 upon DDX17
overexpression. * significantly different compared to DHT alone (p < 0.05).

Transcriptomic Analysis of Pyrvinium Treatment
We performed
RNA-seq on LAPC4 cells treated with vehicle, DHT, or DHT + PP. We
found that biological duplicate samples clustered together by principal
component analysis (Figure 4A) and by hierarchical clustering (Figure 4B), as expected. Several hundred genes were
found to be significantly differentially expressed when comparing
any two groups. Gene ontology analysis using the IPA upstream regulator
module demonstrated that DHT treatment increased androgen/AR signaling,
as evidenced by the “activated” signatures for AR, DHT,
and the AR agonist metribolone (Figure 4C). The addition of PP caused decreases not only in
androgen/AR signaling (“inhibited” DHT signature), but
also in estrogen and glucocorticoid signaling (Figure 4D). As we have shown previously, PP has some
activity against other hormone nuclear receptors in prostate cancer
cells;16 so, this is expected as well.
However, PP also appears to inhibit the p53 and HER2 signaling signatures
while increasing the signaling pathways mediated by EIF2AK3 and ATF4,
as well as the signatures of tosedostat and tunicamycin treatment.
Pathway analysis suggested that this upregulation was associated with
increased ER stress, response to unfolded protein, and apoptosis.
These additional points of regulation might contribute to the profound
antiprostate cancer effect of PP.

LAPC4 cells were
treated overnight with vehicle, 0.3 nM DHT, or DHT +100 nM PP. RNA
was harvested and sequenced. Principal component analysis (A) demonstrates
clustering of biological duplicates, as does hierarchical clustering
(B). Gene ontology demonstrates appropriate response to DHT (C). (D)
PP treatment caused decreased nuclear hormone receptor signaling as
well as P53 and ERBB2 signaling; it also caused activation of pathways
unrelated to nuclear hormone signaling.

Because several of the proteins identified in the IP–MS
experiment were known to be splicing factors, we interrogated the
RNA-seq data to determine if there were changes in the splicing patterns
with PP treatment. Although we found few if any significant differences
with PP treatment in terms of mutually exclusive exon splice forms,
alternative 5′ or 3′ splice site usage, or retained
introns, we did observe an increase in the transcripts with differentially
skipped exons with PP treatment. There were 31 unique transcripts
that lacked an exon in the PP-treated cells compared to the cells
treated with DHT alone, and there were 37 unique transcripts that
lacked an exon in the DHT-treated cells compared to the PP-treated
cells. Gene ontology suggested that the majority of these genes were
involved in alternative splicing or RNA processing (Figure 5A). Several arginine-/serine-rich
splicing factors (SRSFs), including SRSFs 3, 6, and 7, were on this
list. These factors are known to contain a “poison cassette”
exon that, when included in the transcript, causes a premature termination
codon (PTC) to be expressed which targets the transcript for nonsense-mediated
mRNA decay.26 Using the approach of Lareau,
et al.26 we used qPCR to quantify the changes
in the inclusion of the poison cassettes in SRSFs 3 and 7 (Figure 5B,C). We confirmed
the RNA-seq data which demonstrated that PP caused a decrease in the
expression of both SRSF3 and SRSF7 total transcript levels (constitutive
transcription) and that it caused a decreased inclusion of the PTC
exon. Interestingly, DHT treatment itself decreased the total and
PTC-containing transcript levels, which further decreased in a dose-dependent
fashion by PP but was not blocked by enzalutamide treatment. The SRSF
proteins have been shown to control intron inclusion in the transcripts;
therefore, we queried our RNA-seq data to determine if PP was causing
intron inclusion in the transcripts. However, we found no evidence
of this in the data. Although we have shown that PP causes there to
be fewer SRSF transcripts containing a poison cassette, the functional
significance of this finding is unknown.

(constitutive) as well as the levels of PTC-containing transcripts,
which are further reduced in a dose-dependent fashion by PP treatment.
(D) qRT-PCR analysis of AR exons 1 and 7 (with the ratio of exon1/exon7
shown in the inset) and ARV-7. * significantly different compared
to DHT treatment with (p < 0.05).

Finally, we examined the expression of ARV-7 in
LAPC4 cells. We
saw a low-level expression of ARV-7 compared to full-length AR but
no change with DHT or PP treatment (Figure 5D). As ARVs other than ARV-7 may be present,
we also quantified the expression of AR exon 1 and AR exon 7, with
the idea that an increased ARe1:ARe7 ratio would indicate an increased
ARV expression. We found that DHT treatment decreased the levels of
both exon 7 and exon 1, with the decrease in exon 1 being more pronounced.
The addition of PP to DHT further decreased the expression of both
exons. Furthermore, we found that DHT decreased the ARe1/ARe7 ratio
and that the addition of PP did not change the DHT-associated decrease
of the ARe1/ARe7 ratio (Figure 5D), suggesting PP does not alter the levels of ARVs in these
prostate cancer cells.

Pyrvinium was previously identified as
the first AR DBD inhibitor.
Such an inhibitor could contribute significantly to the treatment
of prostate cancers driven by ARVs and other forms of nonligand AR
activation. Another series of compounds proposed to act through AR
DBD was recently reported.27 These compounds
appear to interact with the amino acids Q592 and Y594 on a slightly
different surface of AR DBD than that of pyrvinium. The compounds
are not as potent as PP but do appear to have increased selectivity
for AR versus other nuclear receptors. This may or may not be advantageous,
as limiting off-target effects might reduce the clinical adverse effects,
but targeting multiple nuclear receptors could prevent the functional
replacement of AR as the driver of cancer cell growth. An AR NTD inhibitor
is also in development,28 and although
there is some question about whether or not it acts directly on AR
NTD,29 it is able to inhibit the growth
of prostate cancers in several different models. Although an AR NTD
inhibitor should inhibit prostate cancers driven by ARVs and other
forms of nonligand AR activation as would DBD inhibitors, there is
a legitimate concern that resistance could more readily arise in patients
treated with NTD inhibitors. The NTD, especially the AF-1 region to
which the EPI series of compounds is purported to bind, is a hotspot
for mutation, even in the absence of drug selection.30 Conversely, very few mutations have been found in the highly
conserved DBD, which is absolutely essential for canonical AR transcriptional
activity. In fact, attempts to derive PP-resistant cell lines over
the last several years have been mostly fruitless. We have failed
to develop resistant LNCaP and LAPC4 cell lines, and the only 22Rv1
cell line we developed that was resistant to PP appears to grow in
the presence of PP simply by exporting the drug, as the fluorescent
PP is observed at much lower levels in the resistant cells (Figure S2). In contrast, it is remarkably easy
to develop LNCaP and LAPC4 cell lines that are resistant to bicalutamide
and enzalutamide, as we and others have done.10,31 This might suggest that the development of resistance to PP or other
AR DBD inhibitors would be less likely in humans as well.

In
this manuscript, we confirm a biophysical interaction between
a soluble pyrvinium derivative, P24, and the AR DBD–DNA complex
using NMR. Although the strong peaks in the central region of the
proton dimension spectrum may indicate partial protein denaturization,
most of the changes in the spectrum associated with P24 do not occur
in this central region; so, the results still support P24 binding.
Although crystallographic analysis failed to provide detailed spectra,
the color of the crystal strongly suggests pyrvinium derivative binding
as well. The synthesis and subsequent characterization of P24 will
be described elsewhere as it is being developed as a clinical lead.
We also identified important AR DBD residues that mediate PP sensitivity,
confirming our previous computational modeling.15 As we had previously determined that PP did not prevent
AR interaction with DNA, we hypothesized that it might inhibit the
transcriptional activity by altering the normal DNA-binding kinetics,
which has been shown to be important for AR target gene transcription.32 Although EMSA and ChIP washout experiments were
carried out with two slightly different molecules, making direct comparisons
difficult, neither assay detected any differences in AR binding to
DNA, and thus the results suggest that PP and P24 do not disrupt the
normal DNA-binding kinetics. Other techniques such as fluorescence
recovery after photobleaching will be necessary to confirm this. Although
different binding sites/DNA molecules were used for these and NMR
studies, making direct comparisons among the techniques difficult,
the combined results demonstrating the inability of P24 to disrupt
AR DNA binding further suggest that pyrvinium and its derivatives
do not affect AR DNA binding. Instead, we propose that pyrvinium and
its derivatives prevent AR transcriptional activity by altering the
conformation of AR (as shown in our fluorescent resonance energy transfer
assay14) in such a way that it prevents
the association of necessary cofactors. We previously demonstrated
that RNA pol II has reduced interaction with AR and was absent at
the KLK3 transcription start site,14 and
here, using a proteomics approach, we identified other important factors
whose interactions with AR are diminished in the presence of PP. PP
appears to affect several proteins involved in the splicing process,
including DDX17, which, when overexpressed, reduced the potency of
PP. Although the transcriptomic approach did not detect widespread
changes in splicing, including no difference in the expression of
ARVs, it did identify changes in several splicing proteins, specifically
the arginine-/serine-rich splicing factors. Although exactly how the
inhibition of the interaction between AR and the splicing factors
relates to these changes in splicing remains to be determined, it
is likely that the altered association of AR and the splicing factors
contributes to PP’s activity. Although pyrvinium has been shown
to affect mitochondrial activity and have nonspecific toxicity,27 these effects occur at concentrations well above
those that affect the AR activity and that were used in our studies.
In summary, the mechanism of action of pyrvinium has been further
defined, and the derivatives of pyrvinium have real promise in the
treatment of prostate cancers resistant to advanced hormonal therapies.

Methods
Cells, Culture Conditions, and Reagents
LNCaP and PC3
cells were purchased from ATCC, whereas LAPC4 cells were a gift from
Charles Sawyers. Cells lines have undergone cell line authentication
by ATCC in the last 2 years. The LNCaP and LAPC4 cells were maintained
in phenol red-free RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% FBS and antibiotics,
whereas the PC3 cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified
Eagle’s medium with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and antibiotics.
The cells were transferred to charcoal-stripped (C/S) media prior
to luciferase and qPCR assays. DHT was purchased from steraloids and
PP from Sigma. The synthesis of the soluble pyrvinium derivative P24
will be described elsewhere.

Plasmids, Transfections, and Luciferase Reporter
Assays
Alanine mutations of the AR DBD residues were created
by site-directed
mutagenesis. An AR expression plasmid was amplified with mutant primers
using KAPA high-fidelity polymerase (Kapa Biosystems) using the manufacturer’s
protocol. The parent plasmid was digested with DpnI (Agilent) for
1 h. The mutant plasmids were transformed into NEB 5-alpha competent
cells (NEB). The mutations were screened by Sanger sequencing. The
DDX17 expression plasmid was obtained from the Harvard plasmid repository
(clone HsCD00458034). The cells were transfected using Lipofectamine
LTX & Plus (Thermo Fisher). For luciferase studies, the cells
were transfected with PSA-luciferase18 and
pRL-SV40 (Promega) as a control. The cells were transferred to quadruplicate
wells of a 96-well plate in C/S media 24 h after transfection and
treated with drugs. The luciferase activity was assayed 24 h after
treatment using the dual-luciferase reporter assay system (Promega).
Student’s t test (two-sided and equal variance)
was performed, and the association was considered significant when p < 0.05 and indicated by an asterisk.

Expression
and Purification of AR DBD and15 N-Labeled
AR DBD
The DNA sequences encoding the
DBD of the human AR (AR-B: 557-647) were cloned into an N-terminal
his6-tagged vector (pET28a, Novagen). The vector was transformed
into BL21DE3 Gold Escherichia coli (Agilent)
cells and grown to an OD600 of between 0.2 and 0.4. The
temperature was reduced to 27 °C, ZnCl2 was added
to the final concentration of 10 μM, and the expression was
induced with 0.5 mM IPTG for 4 h when OD600 reached 0.8.
The cells were spun down at 6000g for 15 min, resuspended
in loading buffer (25 mM TrisHCl, pH 7.5, 500 mM NaCl, 15 mM imidazole,
1 mM DTT, 1 mM PMSF), and lysed with an EmulsiFlex C3 homogenizer.
The cell debris was spun down at 40 000 rpm in a Beckman Ti-75
rotor for 1 h at 4 °C. The supernatant was loaded onto a HisTrap
FF column (GE Life Sciences) in loading buffer. The unbound protein
was washed off in low imidazole buffer (25 mM TrisHCl, pH 7.5, 500
mM NaCl, 30 mM imidazole), and his6-AR DBD was eluted with a linear
gradient from 30 to 375 mM imidazole. The cleanest fractions were
pooled and dialyzed overnight at 4 °C into 20 mM TrisHCl, pH
7.5, 50 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM CaCl2, and 1 mM DTT containing
∼10 U/mg thrombin (Sigma) to cleave the his6-tag.
The precipitate was pelleted (40 000 rpm, 1 h, 4 °C),
and the supernatant was loaded onto a cation-exchange column (HiTrap
SP HP, GE Life Sciences), pre-equilibrated with 20 mM TrisHCl, pH
7.5, 50 mM NaCl, and 1 mM DTT, and eluted in a linear gradient of
NaCl from 50 to 350 mM. The fractions containing DBD were pooled,
concentrated (Amicon Ultra—3K, Millipore), filtered (Ultrafree-CL),
run over a gel filtration column (16/600 Superdex 200 PG, GE Life
Sciences) in 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.7, 100 mM NaCl, and 1 mM DTT. The purified
protein was collected, run on a 12% SDS-PAGE to measure purity, and
quantified by A280 (ε = 5095 M–1 cm–1). The 15N-labeled
version was expressed from a single colony of BL21-DE3 transformed
with pET28a-AR DBD and was grown in a 5 mL LB with 100 μg/mL
AMP overnight. The culture was spun down in the morning, inoculated
into 3 L of fresh LB with 100 μg/mL AMP, and grown to an OD600 ∼0.8. These cultures were then spun down (4000g, 10 min at room temperature) and resuspended in M9 minimal
medium, supplemented with vitamins (5 mL of Centrum dissolved in 50
mL water) and 1 g 15NH4Cl, and grown to an OD600 of 1 at 18 °C and then induced overnight with 0.5 mM IPTG.
The culture was then spun down, resuspended in Ni2+ loading
buffer, and purified as described above.

Nuclear Magnetic Resonance
A 1.5 mg 15N-labeled
AR DBD protein in 7 mL 20 mM HEPES buffer was exchanged to 50 mM phosphate
buffer (pH 6.5) containing 1 mM DTT and 0.02% NaN3 and
concentrated to 0.12 mM. The DNA duplex was prepared by annealing
the complementary ssDNA oligos (CCAGAACATCAAGAACAC and GTGTTCTTGATGTTCTGG)
at 95 °C for 5 min in annealing buffer (10 mM Tris, pH 7.5–8.0,
50 mM NaCl, 1 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA)) and then
cooling to room temperature. Stock 120 μM DNA sample was prepared
in 50 mM phosphate buffer (pH 6.5) containing 1 mM EDTA. The AR DBD
and DNA complex was prepared by adding 270 μL of 24 μM
AR DBD gradually to 600 μL of 7.2 μM DNA duplex on ice.
The complex was then concentrated using a 3 kDa cutoff amicon cell
to about 180 μL. Stock P24 solution was prepared in 50 mM phosphate
buffer with pH 6.5 and 10% D2O. P24 (molar ratio of 5.5:1
of P24/AR DBD) was added to the protein–DNA complex. Alternatively,
P24 was added to the protein and DNA samples before the protein was
added to the DNA. In such a preparation, the final molar ratio of
2:1 of P24/AR DBD was used. NMR experiments were carried out on a
Bruker 700 MHz equipped with a TXI-triple resonance inverse cryoprobe
at 25 °C. The spectrum width used for 1H–15N HSQC is 13 and 27.5 ppm with carrier frequency on water
and 116.75 ppm for 1H and 15N, respectively.
The acquisition points are 2048 and 88 for the 1H and 15N dimensions, respectively. The number of scans is 760. The
data were processed using a Bruker TopSpin 3.5.

Electrophoretic
Mobility Shift Assay
A DNA duplex containing
an AR-binding site (GTACGGAACAAAATGTACTGTAC) was first created by
labeling the N-terminus with Cy5 and annealing with the unlabeled
complement oligo in annealing buffer (10 mM TrisHCl, pH 8.0, 100 mM
NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2) at 95 °C for 5 min, followed by
slow cooling to 4 °C over 2.5 h. The annealed duplex were then
stored in a concentrated form at 4 °C until use. To perform the
EMSAs, we first diluted our DNA to 20 nM (a 4× stock) in binding
buffer (20 mM TrisHCl, pH 8.0, 5 mM MgCl2, 5% glycerol,
1 mM EDTA, 300 mM KCl, 200 ng/μL bovine serum albumin (BSA),
1 mM DTT). The protein was diluted from a 426 μM frozen stock
of AR DBD to 10 μM (a 2× stock) in binding buffer. The
10 μM AR DBD stock was then serially diluted 2× in binding
buffer 13 or 14 times in 96-well plates, with the lowest concentration
then being 2.4 or 1.2 nM. We then made two 200× stocks of P24
in 100 mg/mL (2-hydroxypropyl)-β cyclodextran (BCD). For the
low concentration at 200×, we diluted 20 mg/mL (38 mM) P24 to
60 μM in 100 mg/mL BCD, and for the high concentration stock
we diluted to 20 mM in 100 mg/mL BCD. We then diluted each stock to
1:50 in binding buffer (to be used as 4× stock). We then added
10 μL of DNA to 10 μL of P24 in 96-well plates, then added
20 μL of the protein dilutions, and equilibrated at room temperature
for 1 h. While these were being equilibrated, we pre-ran 8% (19:1
acrylamide/bis-acrylamide) native acrylamide gels in 1× Tris-glycine
at 200 V. While still running, we loaded 5 μL of the P24/AR
DBD/DNA mixture onto the gel and ran for 25 min. At the end of the
run, the gel was removed from the plates and placed in water and then
imaged immediately (BioRad ChemiDoc MP Imaging System-Image Lab 4.1
Software) using the preprogrammed Cy5 channel. Affinities were calculated
by the fraction bound using the disappearance of the free DNA band.
The bands were then quantified from gel images using GE ImageQuant
TL 7.0 software, using an unbound area for background correction.
The fraction of DNA bound was plotted against the log of protein concentration
and fit to the following equation (GraphPad Prism 7.00): y = 100 × “X”h/(Kdh + “X”h). An average Kd and the standard error
were determined from four repeats performed on different days.

RT and
qPCR
The total RNA was isolated from the cells
using the GeneJET RNA purification kit (Thermo Scientific). The isolated
RNA was then reverse-transcribed with Moloney murine leukemia virus
reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). The relative target gene expression
was then assessed by qPCR with an SYBR green detection dye (Invitrogen)
and Rox reference dye (Invitrogen) on the StepOne Real-Time PCR System
(Applied Biosystems). Using the ΔΔCt relative quantification method, the target
gene readouts were normalized to RPL19 and GADPH transcript levels.
The experiments are the average of biological triplicates; p values were calculated using a two-tailed Student’s t- test.

AR ChIP
The LNCaP cells in a medium
containing C/S
FBS were treated with 0.1% DMSO vehicle, 1 nM DHT, DHT + 100 nM PP,
or DHT + 100 nM enzalutamide for 4 h at 37 °C. For some cells,
the media were removed, washed once with media, and replaced with
media without drugs for 1.5 h prior to fixation. Fixation was performed
in 1% formaldehyde for 3 min as the dishes cooled from 37 to 22 °C
and 125 mM glycine for 10 min as the dishes cooled from 22 to 4 °C.
The cells were lysed in immunoprecipitation lysis buffer (50 mM Hepes-KOH,
pH 7.4, 1 mM EDTA, 150 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.5% Triton X-100, supplemented
with protease inhibitors) and harvested by scraping. The nuclei were
collected by centrifugation (500g for 5 min at 4
°C), resuspended in 2 mL of immunoprecipitation buffer (10 mM
Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA, 150 mM NaCl, 5% glycerol, 0.1% sodium
deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, supplemented with protease
inhibitors), and sonicated until an average DNA fragment size of 100–500
bp was achieved (assessed by agarose gel electrophoresis). A 10 μg
of anti-AR antibody (PG-21; Millipore) or normal rabbit IgG was used
for immunoprecipitation. The immunoprecipitated material was washed
with immunoprecipitation buffer containing 300 mM NaCl + 100 μg/mL
yeast tRNA and resuspended in 80 μL of proteinase K solution
(pH 8.0, 0.7% SDS, 200 μg/mL proteinase K). After reversing
the cross-links, the DNA fragments were purified using the QIAquick
PCR Purification kit (Qiagen). Real-time PCR was carried out as described
above using primers for the AR-occupied regions previously described,18 and ChIP data were normalized to a region 140
bp upstream of the HSPA1A gene, which is not occupied by AR.

RNA-Seq
RNA sequencing was performed by the City of
Hope Integrative Genomics core facility. cDNA synthesis and library
preparation were performed using the TruSeq RNA Library prep kit in
accordance with the manufacturer-supplied protocols. Libraries were
sequenced on the Illumina Hiseq 2500 with a single read of 40 bp reads.
The 40 bp long single-ended sequence reads were mapped to the human
genome (hg19) using TopHat, and the frequency of the RefSeq genes
was counted with customized R scripts. The raw counts were then normalized
using the trimmed mean of M values method and compared
using Bioconductor package “edgeR”. The average coverage
for each gene was calculated using the normalized read counts from
“edgeR”. Differentially regulated genes were identified
using one-way analysis of variance with linear contrasts to calculate p values, and genes were only considered if the false discovery
rate was <0.25 and the absolute value of the fold change was >2.
There were over 40.2 million reads on average, with greater than 90%
aligned to the human genome. Gene ontology analyses were performed
using GSEA,33 DAVID,34 and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (Qiagen).

IP–MS
Analysis
The LNCaP cells were treated
with drugs for 24 h and lysed in TBS, 0.1% Triton X-100, protease,
and phosphatase inhibitors (Roche). Immunoprecipitation was performed
using anti-AR (AR441, Santa Cruz). Western blot was used to detect
AR (PG-21, Millipore), RNA polymerase II (clone 8WG16; Covance), DDX5
(Millipore #05-850), or DDX17 (Millipore). The immunoprecipitated
AR was separated by SDS-PAGE and stained with SimplyBlue (Themo Fisher).
Gel bands were excised and destained in ammonium bicarbonate. After
disulfide bond reduction with 10 mM tris(carboxyethyl)phosphine and
thiol alkylation with 50 mM iodoacetamide, the gel bands were incubated
with trypsin (Promega) overnight. Peptides were extracted with 0.1%
trifluoroacetic acid/70% acetonitrile and lyophilized. The samples
were prepared and loaded along with a protein standard (yeast alcohol
dehydrogenase) for analysis on a MALDI Q-TOF instrument (Waters) following
separation by liquid chromatography using a C18 column (Waters). Peptide
analysis was performed using Scaffold (Proteome Software, Inc.), with
the relative quantities determined only on proteins with >95% probability
of identity and a minimum of five peptides per sample.
