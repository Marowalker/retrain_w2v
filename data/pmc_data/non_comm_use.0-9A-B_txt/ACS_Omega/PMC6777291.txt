Contributing to recent
lignin valorization efforts, this study
uses an integrative approach to explore the effects of fractionation
parameters on lignin characteristics. The following reaction parameters
are explored: water content of the water–organic solvent mixture,
reaction temperature, and sulfuric acid content. Ethylene glycol (EG)
was selected as the fractionation solvent because of its promising
lignin solubility and extractability. This study takes a novel approach
in conducting EG-assisted biomass fractionation; instead of removing
lignin from the biomass, lignin was extracted and characterized. Lignin
characteristics involving recovery and linkages were analyzed. A maximum
of 27 wt % lignin recovery was achieved at a low water content (25%)
and high reaction temperature (180 °C) in the presence of sulfuric
acid (1 wt %). From NMR analysis, aryl–ether linkages, which
are important to preserve for lignin valorization, were decomposed
as a result of relatively high temperature and the presence of sulfuric
acid. Statistical analysis showed that all individual parameters and
their interactions had significant effects on lignin recovery. Computational
analysis revealed that hydrogen bonding between the EG and lignin
macromolecules greatly decreased with an increasing amount of water.

Introduction
In response to the rapidly increasing
demand for energy and materials,
there is a need for sustainable solutions more than ever. Bioenergy
is one such solution because it is abundant and renewable. While the
cellulose in lignocellulosic biomass is commonly used to produce bioethanol,1 lignin in biomass tends to be viewed as a byproduct
and is commonly discarded.2 Although annual
world lignin generation exceeds 50 million metric tons,2,3 it is still underutilized as low-grade fuel4 and animal feed.5−7 Lignin has traditionally been viewed as an undesirable
product in biomass utilization because of its complex structure with
recalcitrant behaviors8−10 and unpredictable tendencies to depolymerize and
repolymerize.11 However, from a more recent
technoeconomic and environmental standpoint, lignin has many practical
applications that can reduce costs and waste in the long run. Novel
lignin valorization efforts have focused on lignin’s potential
to produce low molecular weight building block chemicals;5,10,12 these versatile chemicals have
industrial applications, such as the synthesis of polymers,13 commodity chemicals,4 surfactants, dyes, adhesives, and fertilizers.14,15

High-quality lignin is defined to be lignin with abundant
aryl–ether
linkages, including β-O-4 linkages, because such linkages are
proportional to the yield of low molecular weight phenolic compounds.16 These low molecular weight compounds act as
building block chemicals that are versatile in the polymer industry.
Organosolv fractionation is employed to recover lignin from biomass
in a way that minimizes harm to the environment.17 While organosolv fractionation has traditionally been used
to remove lignin, it can also be used to recover lignin. In this novel
approach toward lignin extraction, organosolv fractionation extracts
lignin from biomass into a liquid fraction, and the lignin can be
recovered through precipitation followed by filtration. Because an
acidic environment facilitates lignin precipitation,18,19 it can be used in the fractionation process. However, employing
acid catalysts in the fractionation process often causes significant
structural changes of lignin. For instance, acids can readily cleave
aryl–ether linkages, decompose major lignin interunit linkages
in biomass, and induce repolymerization with aromatic units by forming
condensed aromatic C–C bonds.20,21 Therefore,
the use of acid catalysts potentially influences the quality of recovered
lignin.

In a typical organosolv process, low boiling point solvents
including
methanol, ethanol, and isopropyl alcohol are used to fractionate biomass
components due to relatively low cost and easy solvent recovery. Ethylene
glycol (EG) is reported as an effective organic solvent for lignin
fractionation because of its relatively high lignin extraction capability
compared to other organic solvents.22,23 EG has a high
lignin solubility relative to other solvents such as ethanol and methanol.
This high lignin solubility can be explained by a Hansen solubility
parameter; because EG has a relatively large hydrogen bonding component,
lignin is highly soluble in EG.24 Although
high boiling point polyols such as EG and glycerol are commonly criticized
for being difficult to recycle after biomass pretreatment, the low
equipment requirement and inexpensive cost are favorable from an economic
perspective.25 In this study, the effects
of three reaction parameters including water content (defined as the
volumetric percentage of water in a water–organic solvent mixture),
reaction temperature, and sulfuric acid content on lignin recovery
were explored. Softwood was selected as the feedstock in this biomass
fractionation study because it is known to be the most recalcitrant
lignocellulosic biomass due to its high lignin content.26 Water is used along with EG for technoeconomic
and environmental purposes. The use of water decreases organic chemical
(EG) use in upstream processes and reduces water and energy consumption
for EG removal from biomass in downstream processes. Furthermore,
water decreases the viscosity of fluid to facilitate high biomass
loading in industrial applications.27 Although
water addition has many advantages as described above, it possibly
reduces lignin recovery because of the hydrogen bonding between water
and EG molecules.28 For this reason, the
water–EG ratio was selected as the primary parameter of interest
in this study. Temperature is a well-known reaction parameter in biomass
fractionation processes. For instance, an insufficient reaction temperature
could not effectively extract lignin from biomass, while a severe
temperature significantly modified the intact lignin linkages.5 Similarly, the addition of sulfuric acid increased
lignin recovery,18,19 but it could also break β-O-4
linkages in lignin. It is necessary to understand the effects of each
parameter on lignin recovery, and further optimization is needed to
develop a sustainable lignin fractionation process.

This study
aims to (1) explore effects of fractionation parameters
on lignin characteristics including quantity and physicochemical properties
of lignin recovered from softwood and to (2) determine the significance
of individual and interactive parameters’ effects on lignin
recovery using a full factorial design. Density functional theory
(DFT) is used to calculate bond lengths and interaction energies in
lignin–EG–water mixtures to better understand mechanistic
interactions. To achieve these aims, EG-assisted fractionation was
conducted on softwood and recovered lignin was characterized.

Results
and Discussion
Lignin Recovery
EG has relatively
high lignin solubility
compared to other organic solvents;22 thus,
it can facilitate effective biomass fractionation and recover a relatively
substantial amount of lignin.27 The maximum
lignin recovery was 27 wt % at 25% water content and 180 °C with
1 wt % sulfuric acid. On the other hand, the minimum lignin recovery
was 0.4% at 75% water content and 160 °C without sulfuric acid. Figure 1 shows lignin recovery
values obtained from each of the eight fractionation experiments.
Significantly, different lignin recoveries were observed between experiments
depending on the water contents under the same reaction temperatures
and the same sulfuric acid contents. A lower water content resulted
in a higher lignin recovery because more lignin is extracted from
biomass by EG. Sulfuric acid loading affected the lignin recovery
because it catalyzed the hydrolysis reaction of aryl–ether
linkages and made fragmented lignin soluble in EG.18,19 At a higher reaction temperature, bonds between lignin and other
biomass components were easier to break, making the lignin more accessible
and readily dissolved in EG. In a similar study, sugarcane bagasse
was fractionated by an EG–water mixture (10% water content)
with 1.2% sulfuric acid at 130 °C for 30 min, and it resulted
in 35.8% lignin recovery.27 Even though
several parameters were different from the ones explored in this current
study, the fractionation procedure was similar. It is speculated that
this higher lignin recovery is attributed to using an EG–water
mixture with a very low water content and a specific type of biomass.
Generally, it is easier to separate biomass components from herbaceous
biomass compared to woody biomass due to woody biomass having higher
lignin content and more rigid structures.

and sulfuric acid content (wt %) at
160 and 180 °C on lignin recovery (%).

Lignin Characterization
Lignins fractionated from spruce,
pine, and fir (SPF) softwood under different reaction conditions were
characterized using two-dimensional (2D) heteronuclear single quantum
coherence (HSQC) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analysis as shown
in Figure 2. Among
several experiments, three fractionation experiments (180 °C,
0 wt % sulfuric acid, and 25% water content; 180 °C, 1 wt % sulfuric
acid, and 25% water content; 160 °C, 1 wt % sulfuric acid, and
25% water content) were selected for physicochemical property analyses
of lignin by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) and NMR techniques.
The structural information of the recovered lignins was studied using
NMR analysis. Both aromatic (δC/δH 105–140/6.0–8.5)
and aliphatic regions (δC/δH 50–90/3.0–5.5)
were investigated for the information of lignin subunits and interunit
linkages. The assignments of HSQC NMR spectra were determined as reported
in a previous study.29 According to the
HSQC NMR results of the three samples (180 °C, 0 wt % sulfuric
acid, and 25% water content; 180 °C, 1 wt % sulfuric acid, and
25% water content; 160 °C, 1 wt % sulfuric acid, and 25% water
content), higher temperature and sulfuric acid content loading in
the fractionation process led to more decomposition of lignin interunit
linkages. In particular, the contours of β-O-4 linkages, indicated
as Aα and Aβ, were clearly found in lignin resulting from 180 °C without
sulfuric acid as well as from 160 °C and 1 wt % sulfuric acid
to a lesser extent. However, in the fractionation experiment with
180 °C and 1 wt % sulfuric acid, there were no contours of these
aryl–ether bonds. This observation also suggests that the combined
effect of sulfuric acid and temperature on the quality of recovered
lignin is much more significant than that of the individual parameters.
The same trend occurs with phenylcoumaran (B) and resinol
substructures (C); such linkages were cleaved at 180
°C with 1 wt % sulfuric acid. These observations indicate that
the presence of sulfuric acid significantly affects the cleavage of
major lignin linkages to a greater extent than reaction temperature.

acid, 25% water content; (C) lignin from 160 °C, 1 wt % sulfuric
acid, 25% water content; (D) main structures present in lignin from
SPF wood.

While condensed guaiacyl units
were observed from the extracted
lignin at 180 °C and 1 wt % sulfuric acid and 160 °C with
1 wt % sulfuric acid, the condensed aromatics were not detected from
the lignin recovered at 180 °C and 0 wt % sulfuric acid. These
results indicate that an acidic environment promoted lignin condensation
reactions by forming reactive benzyl carbocations,30 which resulted in condensed aromatics. It was also noted
that the softwood lignin was more susceptible to condensation reactions
because guaiacyl units have a large amount of unsubstituted aromatic
carbons at the C5 position.5 Recently,
it was reported that 1,4-butanediol can effectively fractionate reactive
lignin in a lignin-first biorefinery approach.24 As a common diol solvent along with EG, it showed a high
capability of dissolving the lignin and efficiently separated lignin
streams with a high amount of β-O-4 linkages. This suggests
that diols, including EG, are effective in preserving β-O-4
linkages in fractionated lignin.

Molecular weights and polydispersity
index values for the three
recovered lignin samples from EG-assisted fractionation along with
milled wood lignin (MWL) extracted from the raw material are presented
in Table 1. As shown,
the Mw of MWL, a representative native
lignin, was found to be 8752 g/mol. In the presence of an acid catalyst,
the extracted lignin has a Mw value of
1689 g/mol, which is 68% lower compared to that without the acid catalyst
(5271 g/mol). These results align with NMR results; the addition of
acid during the biomass fractionation effectively catalyzes the cleavage
of aryl–ether bonds, resulting in the production of lignin
fragments and a subsequently high lignin recovery.

Statistical
Analysis
The second-order polynomial of
the best fit is shown below 1  

The R2 value
of the model is 0.9999, while the adjusted R2 value is 0.9999; because these values are identical, the
model is a good fit for the experimental data.

Table 2 demonstrates
the use of analysis of variance (ANOVA) to determine the significance
of the models. The null hypothesis of the ANOVA test states that the
means of the levels of factors A, B, and C are the same and that there are interactions
between factors A and B, factors A and C, and factors B and C. According to Table 2, the probability of obtaining an F-value greater than the calculated one is less than 0.05
at a 95% significance level. As a result, there is sufficient evidence
that means of the factor levels are not the same and that there are
interactions between factors A and B, factors A and C, and factors B and C. It proceeds that all individual
parameters and their interactions have significant effects on lignin
recovery.

To determine the significance of
each coefficient in Equation 5, a statistical t-test is employed for each
parameter. The t-test
results show whether main effects and interactions effects are significant
on lignin recovery.31 The null hypothesis
is that the true value of each parameter is zero, thereby having no
significant effect on lignin recovery. According to Table 3, all parameters and interactions
are significant because their p-values are all less
than 0.05.

Figure 3 consists
of surface plots that were constructed to better understand the interactive
effects of water content, reaction temperature, and sulfuric acid
content on lignin recovery. Equation 5 is used as a formula to predict lignin recovery values
for the surface plots. To obtain the maximum lignin recovery within
the scope of parameter values used in this study, the following reaction
condition should be employed: 25% water content, 180 °C, and
1% sulfuric acid. As expected, high lignin recovery is associated
with low water content, high reaction temperature, and high sulfuric
acid content. Furthermore, from plots A and B, the interactive effects
of the water content and temperature as well as the water content
and sulfuric acid content on lignin recovery were similar. Temperature
and sulfuric acid content have a similarly lesser effect on lignin
recovery than that of the water content. This trend is further demonstrated
in plot C, where lignin recovery increases at a similar rate with
respect to sulfuric acid content and temperature. It is noted that
there are only two levels at each factor in this design. More levels
at each factor achieve a broader range of values for an improved design.

acid content; (C) sulfuric acid content and temperature.

Effect of Water Content on Lignin Recovery
While it
is widely known that EG is highly soluble in water,32,33 the effect of adding water to organic solvents on lignin recovery
has seldom been explored. As a result, an experiment investigating
the solubility of lignin in various EG–water mixtures was conducted. Figure 4 depicts the colors
of organosolv lignin dissolved in EG–water mixtures with varying
water contents. Organosolv lignin dissolved in water forms a slightly
cloudy yellow solution, while organosolv lignin dissolved in EG forms
a transparent dark brown solution. The color of the lignin dissolved
in the solvent mixture with 25% water content is significantly darker
than that in the mixture with 75% water content, suggesting greater
lignin solubility in the solvent mixture with 25% water content.

Figure 4 Qualitative
observations of organosolv lignin dissolved in EG–water
mixtures with varying water contents from 0 to 100 (A). The lignin
concentration in each solution was 5 g/L. Quantitative observations
in exploring the effect of the water content on normalized absorbance
readings (B).

Quantitative data of the experiment
investigating lignin solubility
supports the qualitative data in that a smaller water content results
in greater lignin solubility. To make sense of the absorbance readings
collected from the experiment, the highest absorbance reading was
normalized to a value of 1; all other absorbance readings were taken
relative to that value. Assuming absorbance readings to be proportional
to lignin solubility, Figure 4 shows that normalized absorbance readings are inversely proportional
with the water content, and this trend roughly aligns with data from
fractionation experiments conducted (see Figure 1). An EG–water mixture with 25% water
content containing lignin had a normalized absorbance reading of 0.459,
which is 6.9 times more compared to the normalized absorbance reading
at a 75% water content. This suggests that the solubility of lignin
in EG–water mixtures is significantly lower at greater water
contents.

Qualitative and quantitative results support the hypothesis
that
an increased water proportion in an EG–water solvent mixture
leads to a lower lignin recovery because of the relatively low lignin
solubility during fractionation. This could be attributed to two reasons
or a combination of the reasons: (a) hydrophobicity of lignin or (b)
EG–water hydrogen bonds. It is also important to note that
these reasons do not conflict with each other but can rather be two
valid reasons for decreasing lignin solubilities as the water content
increases.

The trend observed in Figure 4 could also be attributed to lignin’s
hydrophobic
properties. In a similar way that water is used to precipitate lignin
out during the lignin precipitation stage of the fractionation experiments,
the addition of water to EG in the lignin solubility experiments could
simply result in less lignin dissolving in the solvent mixture. Such
hydrophobic interactions between lignin and water could be a reason
why an increasing water content would result in decreasing lignin
recovery. However, such a speculation merits more evidence.

Interactions between a lignin dimeric compound, an EG molecule,
and a water molecule were investigated using a constructed DFT model. Figure 5 depicts the different
hydrogen bond lengths between the same oxygen atom of EG and same
hydrogen atom of lignin in two arrangements. Hydrogen bond lengths
between the lignin dimer and EG are consistently longer in mixtures
with water. For instance, hydrogen bond a has a length
of 1.7892 Å, while the hydrogen bond d has a length
of 1.8378 Å. This implies that the addition of water weakens
the hydrogen bonds between the lignin dimer and EG. Because hydrogen
bonds between the hydroxyl groups in EG and lignin contribute to the
lignin dissolution in EG,22 hydrogen bond
lengths from the DFT model suggest that the addition of water in organic
solvents used for fractionation decrease lignin recovery.

Figure 5 Optimized geometry
of (A) a lignin model dimer and EG and (B) a
lignin model dimer, EG, and two water molecules. The following pairs
of hydrogen bonds represent the bonds between the same hydrogen atom
and oxygen atom: bonds a and d, bonds b and e, and bonds c and f. Hydrogen bond lengths are as follows: 1.7892 Å for a, 2.8967 Å for b, 2.8397 Å for c, 1.8378 Å for d, 3.3774 Å for e, and 2.9369 Å for f.

Studies reporting strong hydrogen bonding interactions between
the hydroxyl groups of water and EG support the DFT model.28,34 A study employing near-infrared spectroscopy found that in EG–water
mixtures, small water clusters surround the OH groups of EG; this
results in strong hydrogen bonds between the hydroxyl oxygen atoms
in EG and the water hydrogen atoms.28 These
conclusions support the varying hydrogen bond lengths in Figure 5 because the presence
of water molecules causes interactions between water and EG; this
results in significantly fewer available oxygen atoms of EG hydroxyl
groups to form hydrogen bonds with certain hydrogen atoms in the lignin
dimer. At a higher water content, the small water clusters that could
surround the hydroxyl groups of EG molecules reduce the chances of
hydrogen bond formation between lignin and EG.

In addition to
hydrogen bonding, interaction energies can be analyzed
to develop a better understanding of interactions between lignin,
EG, and water. A study on energy decomposition analysis shows that
the interaction energy between EG and water increases each time a
water molecule is added to the same number of molecules of EG.32 The DFT models in Figure 5 align with this analysis; structure A has
an interaction energy of 13.91 kcal/mol, while structure B has an
interaction energy of 39.12 kcal/mol. These results may indicate that
the water molecules form stable structures with EG molecules, leading
to fewer interactions between lignin molecules and EG molecules.

Although the experiment conducted on lignin solubility and the
constructed DFT model provides mechanistic insights on EG–lignin
interactions to understand the effect of the water content on lignin
recovery, there are several limits to the DFT model. Conclusions drawn
from the simple model can develop, rather than ensure, an understanding
of interactions between EG, water, and lignin. Besides the lignin
model compound used in the study, there are other compounds in lignin
that interact with EG and water.

Conclusions
EG-assisted
biomass fractionation resulted in 27 wt % lignin recovery,
but it also significantly cleaved aryl–ether bonds in lignin
during the process. The use of the sulfuric acid catalyst at a high
temperature during the fractionation cleaved most aryl–ether
linkages in lignin, which are important to preserve for lignin valorization.
Statistical analysis shows that all individual effects and interactive
effects were significant on lignin recovery. DFT results imply that
the addition of water to EG decreased lignin recovery due to strong
EG–water hydrogen bonds and the resulting decrease in the intermolecular
interaction between EG and lignin.

Experimental Section
Materials
A softwood mixture of SPF was purchased from
Okanagan Pellet Company (Kelowna, BC, Canada) and ground to a size
of less than 250 μm. The moisture content of the air-dried SPF
was 5.8 wt %. Table 4 shows the chemical composition of the raw material that was analyzed
according to the NREL protocol.35 Sulfuric
acid (96.5 wt % assay) and EG were purchased from Fisher Scientific
and Sigma-Aldrich, respectively, and they were used without further
purification.

EG-Assisted Fractionation of Biomass
In the fractionation
process, SPF wood was added to an EG–water mixture and heated
at a target temperature of 160 or 180 °C to separate biomass
components. Approximately, 10 g of SPF wood was loaded with 100 mL
of the EG–water mixture (water content of 25 or 75%) to a 460
mL Parr batch reactor (Parr Instrument, US). Sulfuric acid (0 or 1
wt % of biomass loading) was also added to the mixture. During the
reaction, the mixture was treated at the target temperature with 300
rpm stirring for 1 h; the temperature inside the reactor was kept
within 5 °C of the target temperature. Once the reaction completed,
the reactor was cooled to room temperature in an ice bath. The mixture
was filtered, and the solid cake was washed with an EG–water
mixture (the same water content as that of the reaction solvent).
The solid cake was washed a second time with distilled water, so that
the residual EG was removed from the solid cake.

A volume of
water (∼3 times the volume of the filtrate) was added to the
filtrate to facilitate lignin precipitation. If no sulfuric acid was
added during pretreatment, sulfuric acid (1% of wood loading mass)
was added to facilitate lignin precipitation. The mixture was placed
in a fridge for 24 h to further facilitate lignin precipitation. The
lignin precipitates were filtered and washed with distilled water;
the washed lignins were dried and stored at 50 °C in a vacuum
oven for further analysis.

Lignin recovery was calculated as
a percentage of the experimentally
recovered lignin mass (g) to the theoretical lignin mass (g) 2  where
theoretical lignin mass indicated the
actual mass of lignin that can be extracted from the wood mass used
in the experiment, as determined by the NREL protocol35 3  

Lignin Characterization
Techniques
GPC analysis was
conducted to determine the molecular weight of the lignin samples.
Prior to the analysis, lignin samples were acetylated in an acetic
anhydride/pyridine mixture (1:1, v/v) at 25 °C for 24 h. Acetylated
lignins were dissolved in tetrahydrofuran (THF) for GPC analysis.
Lignin molecular weight analysis was conducted using the Agilent GPC
Security 1200 system equipped with three Walters Styragel columns
(HR1, HR2, and HR6) and an ultraviolet detector. The analysis was
conducted with THF as a mobile phase at 1.0 mL/min. Polystyrene standards
were used for calibration. Polymer Standards Service WinGPC Unity
software was used for data collection and processing.

A 2D 1H–13C HSQC NMR analysis was conducted to
understand the structural changes of lignin during fractionation.
The recovered lignin was dissolved in a 5 mm NMR tube with DMSO-d6. The NMR experiment was conducted at 300 K
using a Bruker AVANCE 800 MHz spectroscopy equipped with a TCI CryoProbe
with the following conditions: spectral width of 12 ppm in F2 (1H) with 1024 data points and 220 ppm in F1 (13C)
with 512 data points; 32 scans (NS) and 1.5 s interscan delay (D1).

Computational Analysis
The mechanistic interactions
between lignin, EG, and water were explored by conducting computational
analysis. Considering that the structure of lignin is very complex,
it is difficult to conduct a mechanistic study with the lignin macromolecule.
Instead, lignin model compounds are typically employed for computational
simulations.22 In this work, (1-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-2-phenoxypropane-1,3-diol),
a lignin model dimer, was used to represent the lignin macromolecule.
Two molecular models with varying elements were produced: one consisted
of the lignin dimer and an EG molecule, while the other consisted
of the lignin dimer, an EG molecule, and a water molecule. Bond distances
between the hydrogen atoms of the lignin dimer and the oxygen atoms
of the EG molecule were compared between the two models.

The
geometry optimization of the lignin dimeric model compound, EG, and
water were performed using DFT with the B3LYP and the 6-31+G(d,p)
basis set. In addition, frequency calculations were conducted to verify
that the optimized structures corresponded to energy minima. The most
stable structure of the lignin dimer, EG, and water was used to calculate
interaction energy (IE) using the supermolecular approach 4  

All quantum chemical calculations were carried
out using the Gaussian
09 suite of programs (Gaussian, Inc., Wallingford, CT).

Lignin Solubility
in Varying EG-Water Mixtures
To elucidate
the effect of the water content on lignin recovery, a simple experiment
was conducted. Organosolv lignin (0.1 g) extracted from SPF wood was
put in 20 mL EG-water mixtures with the five following water contents:
0, 25, 50, 75, and 100%. The contents of the vial were mixed using
an ultrasonic bath for 1 h. The solid content was filtered using Whatman
1001-110 Grade 1 qualitative filter paper. The filtrate was put in
a centrifuge (Cole-Parmer) to remove any insoluble lignin and transferred
to a cuvette for UV spectrophotometer (1600 PC, VWR) analysis at 240
nm, the wavelength to detect soluble lignin. EG-water mixtures (20
mL) at the five aforementioned water contents without lignin were
used as blank solutions. The absorbance reading of each sample with
lignin dissolved at varying water contents was taken relative to that
of the corresponding water content without lignin.

Statistical
Design
A statistical full factorial design
was implemented with three factors that have two levels each, as shown
in Table 5. This resulted
in eight experiments conducted in a random order without replication.
The three factors, water content, reaction temperature, and sulfuric
acid content were represented by the variables, A, B, and C, respectively; the response
was lignin recovery.

The second-order polynomial
equation below is used to predict lignin
recovery values, y, based on collected experimental
data, where αn represents regression
coefficients 5  

Regression coefficients were
determined based on experimental data
using JMP software. The model used the standard least-squares personality
with an emphasis set at effect screening. ANOVA was used to determine
the significance of each parameter and their interactions. Response
surfaces were constructed to visually explore the interactions between
factors and their combined effects on lignin recovery.
