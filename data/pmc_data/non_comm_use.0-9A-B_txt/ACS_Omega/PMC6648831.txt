A detailed comprehensive
study on how the formation of soluble
and insoluble carbamazepine/cyclodextrins (CBZ/CD) complexes (with
consequent changes in the solid-phase composition) depends on the
CD structure is not yet available. Moreover, the study of possible
influence of this drug on the tendency of CDs and their complexes
to self-aggregate is still lacking. Phase-solubility studies demonstrated
that CDs and CBZ form a range of soluble (AL-type: αCD,
βCD, and hydroxypropylated CDs) and insoluble (BS-type: γCD) complexes depending on CD used. HPβCD proved
to be the best CD solubilizer for CBZ forming the most stable complex
with highest apparent solubility, whereas γCD was shown to be
the best native CD. For the native CDs, CBZ solubilization increases
with increasing CD cavity diameter (αCD ≪ βCD <
γCD). Solid phases collected from phase-solubility studies were
characterized by Fourier-transformed infrared spectroscopy, differential
scanning calorimetry, and X-ray powder diffraction to elucidate their
composition and crystalline structure. They provided similar conclusions
being overall supportive of phase-solubility, osmolality, and permeation
studies results. Solid CBZ was the only detected component for AL-type profiles over the CD concentration range studied, whereas
precipitation of poorly soluble CBZ/γCD complexes (BS-type) was observed (i.e., at and beyond plateau region). Osmometry
and permeation studies were applied to evaluate the effect of CBZ
on the aggregate formation and also to elucidate their influence on
CD complex solubility and permeation profile. Permeation method was
shown to be the most effective method to detect and evaluate aggregate
formation in aqueous γCD and HPβCD solutions containing
CBZ. CBZ did not affect the HPβCD tendency to self-aggregate
but CBZ did modify the aggregation behavior of γCD decreasing
the apparent critical aggregation concentration value from 4.2% (w/v)
(in pure aqueous γCD solution) to 2.5% (w/v) (when CBZ was present).

1 Introduction
Carbamazepine
(CBZ), 5H-dibenz[b,f]azepine-5-carboxamide, is the most widely used
anticonvulsant drug for the treatment of psychomotor epilepsy. Although
effective, CBZ constitutes a challenge for pharmaceutical formulators
because of its low water solubility (approximately <200 μg/mL),
slow dissolution rate, and polymorphism.1−5 Four different anhydrous forms, and a dihydrate has been described
in the literature, where polymorph form I and form III are the most
frequently encountered.6−8

Although the different polymorphic forms of
CBZ may exhibit different
dissolution rates and bioavailabilities, selection of one polymorphic
form over the others in a formulation may not be a viable route for
improving the bioavailability of the drug. Other methods are needed
to overcome the formulation limitations of CBZ (polymorphism and poor
dissolution rate), one of which is the use of cyclodextrins (CD).9−13 These pharmacopoeial approved excipients are very useful and used
in several commercialized products (pharmaceutical, chemical, food,
cosmetic, etc.) because of their safe toxicological profile and ability
to form water-soluble complexes.12,14−18

In aqueous media, CDs can form inclusion complexes with a
lipophilic
molecule or part of a larger molecule or through formation of noninclusion
complexes.9,17,19 Solubilization
of drugs, through a micelle-like mechanism, may also occur through
formation of CD and/or drug/CD complex aggregates.14,20 This ability of CDs to self-aggregate needs to be controlled by
pharmaceutical formulators, as it sometimes needs to be prevented
(can cause formulation instability provoking therapeutical and economical
losses) but may also be advantageous for creation of novel drug delivery
systems because of its simplicity and versatility.12

Several studies of the interaction between CBZ and
αCD,21 βCD,1−3,5,21−23 γCD,13 HPβCD,13,19,21,24−26 HEβCD,13 DMβCD,13 SBEβCD,4,27 and HPγCD13 have already been published. However, a systematic,
detailed, and comprehensive study on the dependence of CD type on
the formation of soluble and insoluble complexes is not yet available.
The majority of the studies mentioned above utilize classic phase-solubility
studies to characterize the potential of different CD types to increase
the apparent solubility of CBZ by focusing on the increase of CBZ
concentration in solution dependent on initial CD concentration. The
composition and changes in composition of the solid phase are, as
for the majority of studies on drug/CD complexes by phase-solubility
experiments, fully ignored. Moreover, changes in the composition of
the solid phase with respect to CD concentration as a consequence
of possible formation of poorly soluble CD/drug complexes have also
not been studied. Furthermore, none of the previous publications on
this topic have focused on and described the possible influence of
CBZ on the self-aggregation behavior of these CDs and their complexes.
The aim of the present study is to provide a better understanding
of the interaction of CBZ with a range of relevant CDs (varying cavity
sizes: αCD, βCD, and γCD; and by comparing native
and hydroxypropylated CDs) on the basis of phase-solubility studies
including characterization of changes in the composition of the solid
phase, changes in the concentration of CD in solution as compared
to the initial concentration, and the formation of aggregates. To
elucidate the composition and crystalline structure of the solid phases,
we have characterized the solid phases obtained from the phase-solubility
studies by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), differential
scanning calorimetry (DSC), and X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD), some
of which are reported in the Supporting Information. The liquid phases were analyzed using permeation and osmolality
methods for the determination of the influences of CBZ on the flux
profile and apparent critical aggregation concentration (cac) of the
CDs.

2 Results and Discussion
In the first
part of this study, we attempt to correlate the type
of CBZ/CDs phase-solubility diagrams with the composition of the obtained
solid phases and elucidate the importance of CD type on complexation
and solubilization of these systems. To get insight into the nature
of the solid phase, we have used diverse analytical techniques as
previously mentioned. For these tests, A-type phase-solubility profiles
were tested at the highest CD concentration used, whereas B-type phase-solubility
profiles were at least tested at two concentrations (i.e., before
and after the plateau region).

In the second part of this study,
we aim to understand and evaluate
not only if/how CBZ can affect the flux and apparent tendency of studied
CDs to self-aggregate (comparing apparent cac values) when associated
in inclusion/noninclusion complexes but also how the CDs complexes
modulate CBZ permeability through a semi-permeable membrane. This
novel insight was mainly possible because of the performance of osmometry
and permeation studies. Another novelty of this work compared with
most publications in this field (where presented graphs and values
are based on theoretical CD concentrations) was the use of Corona
detector that allowed us to quantify the actual concentration of CDs
and drug (simultaneously) present in liquid phases.

2.1 Phase-Solubility
Studies
Usually
the apparent water solubility of drug is enhanced by the formation
of drug/CD complexes. To evaluate the interaction between CDs and
CBZ, phase-solubility diagrams were made by plotting the concentration
of CBZ brought into solution versus the actual (as opposed to added)
CD concentration (Figures 1 and 2). Slopes were calculated by
plotting all concentration range in case of A-type diagrams or just
using the initial linear portion (for B-type diagrams). Using the
apparent intrinsic solubility (S0) of
CBZ and determined slopes, we were able to determine apparent stability
constants (K1:1) and the complexation
efficiencies (CE). Also, the maximum increase (in percentage) in apparent
solubility of CBZ per mM of CD (IS) was calculated (Table 1).

a Phase-solubility diagrams built
with actual CD concentrations instead of theoretical CD concentrations
only showed some differences for the B-type diagrams (i.e., beyond
the plateau region). As their initial linear part (i.e., before the
plateau region) showed negligible changes, Higuchi–Connors
classification could still be used.

diagram and BS: phase-solubility diagram with linear initial
increase, a plateau and a decreasing terminal solubility.30

It
has previously been described in the literature that native
CDs have low aqueous solubility compared with their hydroxypropylated
derivatives and that the native CDs are more prone to self-assembly
and aggregate formation. This phenomenon can contribute for the definition
of phase-solubility profiles of many drugs.28,29

2.1.1 Native CDs
Hydroxypropylated CD
derivatives (i.e., HPαCD, HPβCD, and HPγCD) are
obtained by random substitution that transforms the crystalline native
CDs into amorphous mixtures of large number of isomers.31,32 Thus, HPαCD, HPβCD, and HPγCD and their complexes
are unable to form crystals in aqueous solutions and, because of their
enhanced solubility, generally display AL-type phase solubility
diagrams. On the other hand, native CDs and their complexes can form
crystalline solid state and, thus, display limited solubility in water
that frequently leads to B-type phase-solubility profiles. However,
in case of CBZ, only γCD presented the BS-type profile
while αCD and βCD displayed AL-type (Table 1). We believe that
for βCD, the A-type phase-solubility diagram is only observed
because of the poor solubility of βCD (high enough βCD
concentrations to observe BS-type diagrams are not possible
to achieve).

Figure 1 shows the phase-solubility profile for native CDs with CBZ.
Combining the analysis of this figure with results of Table 1, it is possible to see that
αCD and CBZ did not have a good interaction although it displayed
AL phase-solubility profile. K1:1 and CE values (8.9 M–1 and 0.006, respectively)
are extremely small pointing to the fact that αCD cavity is
too small to host/interact with any part of CBZ.

As already
mentioned, because of low aqueous solubility, βCD
displayed an AL phase-solubility profile with CBZ (Figure 1). Apparent solubility
of formed complex increased linearly with increasing βCD concentration.
Complexation of CBZ by βCD was possible and more effective when
compared to αCD as all parameters described in Table 1 increased significantly.

Generally, γCD displays BS-type profiles with
guests and CBZ was not an exception. In Figure 1, a typical BS-profile for γCD
with characteristic regions is presented: First, a linear region,
where the increase of CD concentration leads to the formation of water-soluble
CBZ/γCD complexes that, consequently, increase CBZ total solubility.
Thereafter a plateau region, where the maximum CBZ solubility is achieved,
was expected. This region is not apparent from the data obtained.
Finally, the descendent part is achieved and it is characterized by
the decrease of apparent CBZ solubility due to formation of insoluble
CBZ/γCD complexes. This happens because all the solid CBZ has
been brought into solution or precipitated as CD complex and that
the increase in γCD concentration will promote precipitation
of the complex.

Overall, all calculated parameters presented
in Table 1 (slope, K1:1, CE, and IS) increased with increasing CD
cavity size (αCD
< βCD < γCD). Concerning the linear part of the
phase-solubility diagrams, γCD registered the highest value
for CE and IS of the native CDs showing that this was the native CD
that interacted the strongest (i.e., formed most stable complex) and
brought the most CBZ into solution.

All registered slopes were
smaller than unity which suggests the
formation of simple 1:1 CBZ/native CD complexes in accordance with
literature.3,13,21,22,24

2.1.2 Hydroxypropylated Cyclodextrins
The phase-solubility
diagrams obtained for the hydroxypropylated
CDs (HP-CDs) also gave straight lines characteristic for AL-type profiles (Figure 2).

These modified CDs were capable of solubilizing CBZ and
to increase its apparent solubility with increasing CD concentration
linearly. Similarly to αCD, HPαCD was also the least efficient
CD of this group to bring CBZ into solution. The smaller cavity size
probably hinders the interaction as revealed by the calculated parameters
(i.e., K1:1 = 31.4 M–1; CE = 0.022).

On the basis of calculated parameters (K1:1, CE, and IS), it is possible to see that
HPβCD was overall
the best CD tested because it formed the most stable complex and resulted
in the largest increase in CBZ solubility (Figure 2 and Table 1).

The observed slope values were smaller than
unity, which is an
indication that complex formation follows a simple 1:1 stoichiometry
also in the case of CBZ/HP-CD systems. Several authors using phase-solubility
studies in combination with other analytical methods (e.g., FTIR,
DSC, and XRPD) have also reported similar data. They also found evidence
of simple inclusion complex formation (1:1 complexes) after interaction
of CBZ with HPβCD13,19,21,24−26,33 and HPγCD,13,33 although always
presenting smaller apparent K1:1 values
compared with those presented here. However, these discrepancies may
be due to the use of a different type of HPβCD compared with
the other studies (e.g., different manufactures of HPβCD producing
products with varying DS).

Contrary to the native CDs, analysis
of the slope K1:1, CE, IS for CBZ/HP-CDs
(Table 1) does not
suggest direct influence of CD
central cavity diameter on the increase of CBZ solubilization/complexation.

2.2 Characterization of Solid-Phase Compositions
The composition of solid phases resulting from the phase-solubility
studies (Section 2.1) was determined by FTIR spectroscopy, DSC, and XRPD.

All techniques
provided similar conclusions (see the Supporting Information), and results were supportive of phase-solubility
experiments. The composition of the solid phase can be predicted from
the phase-solubility diagram type and possibly by CD aggregation process
(Table 2). This basically
originates form the inherent ability of native CD to form insoluble
complexes (resulting in B-type phase solubility diagrams), a trait
not found for typical randomly modified CD’s (e.g., commercially
available hydroxypropyl derivatives). Here, their inability to form
insoluble complexes most often results in A-type diagrams in the concentration
ranges studied.

although it is not
possible to exclude the presence of pure drug (depending on the initial
excess of drug added and availability of CD in liquid phase at that
stage).	
2.3 Osmolality Measurements
Osmometry
is a colligative property that indicates the number of all osmotically
active molecules dissolved in the solvent and in our previous research
proved to be quite useful to detect native CDs aggregates.34

In an attempt to detect/quantify CBZ/CD
inclusion complexes aggregates and also tracing possible changes in
the apparent solubility of the CD complexes as a consequence of interaction
with soluble CBZ, the osmometry method was applied to liquid phases
from the phase-solubility experiment after careful separation of the
liquid and solid phases.

The osmolality of freshly prepared
CD aqueous solutions (represented
by lines) and CD solutions saturated with CBZ (represented by symbols
with lines) were plotted against CD concentrations. We expect that
total osmolality will remain constant or become slightly higher in
case of the formation of soluble complexes. Total osmolality will
be equal to osmolality of CD plus the one obtained from increased
apparent solubility of CBZ (as CD is present in higher amount, usually
this possible osmolality increase is only visible for βCD complexes).
On the other hand, we will observe a decrease in total osmolality
in the case of systems that displayed phase-solubility B-type, as
from some region (beyond plateau) precipitation of solid complex will
decrease the particle concentration in the solution.

2.3.1 Native CDs
Different trends in
osmolality behavior were registered for native CDs after interaction
with CBZ, depending on the sample phase-solubility type (Figure 3).

Figure 3 (a) Changes of total
osmolality for the prepared CBZ/αCD
and CBZ/γCD systems during phase-solubility experiments (25
°C). (b) Changes of total osmolality for the CBZ/βCD systems
during phase-solubility experiments (25 °C). Symbols represent
mean ± SD (n = 3).

For CBZ/αCD liquid phases, almost no changes were observed
in osmolality from samples saturated with CBZ (Figure 3a). This is in accordance with phase-solubility
results as the presented osmolality plot is typical from AL-type profiles.

In the case of CBZ/βCD, the presence
of CBZ promotes a small
constant increase of the osmolality of the CD solutions throughout
the concentration range (Figure 3b).

Commonly, samples containing γCD show
negative deviations
of osmolality from stock solutions trend, caused by a decrease in
particle concentration due to the precipitation of poorly soluble
CBZ/γCD complexes at a certain CD concentration (Figure 3a). The BS-type
profile nature of this system justifies the appearance of CBZ/γCD
osmolality graphic that can be divided into three characteristic regions.
As saturation concentration for the complex is achieved with relatively
low γCD concentrations, the two first regions are relatively
short. First, we observe the linear region (until ∼0.006 M)
where the CBZ/γCD complex contributes to the increase of system
osmolality because the osmolality of the solution containing both
CBZ and γCD is higher than that observed for the γCD stock
solution alone. This effect will continue until the crossing point
with the CD curve (second region represented by a small plateau from
∼0.006 to 0.014 M) where the poorly soluble CBZ/γCD complex
starts to form and overall osmolality will remain almost unalterable.
Then, we enter on the last region for this system (beyond plateau
region, from ∼0.014 M), where precipitation of poorly soluble
complex stops because of unavailability of solid CBZ, and adding more
γCD will only increase the amount of free γCD in solution.
Because of this, the total osmolality of the system starts to increase
again, however, never reaching γCD stock solution values (dot
line in Figure 3a).

2.3.2 Hydroxypropylated Cyclodextrins
Similarly,
to the CBZ/αCD and CBZ/βCD systems (AL-type),
also the saturation of HP-CDs with CBZ did not provide
any significant change on system total osmolality (Figure 4). It is typical for A-type
profiles that throughout the CD concentration range, the amount of
osmotically active particles remains the same or slightly higher in
comparison with the initial CD stock solution. The described behavior
observed in Figure 4 excludes the possibility of formation and precipitation of CBZ/HP-CDs
inclusion complexes.

Figure 4 Total osmolality changes for of the prepared CBZ/HP-CD
systems
during phase-solubility experiments (25 °C). Symbols represent
mean ± SD (n = 3).

Altogether, these observations corroborate phase-solubility
results
for HP-CDs, where they displayed AL-type.

Osmometry
proved to be a simple and reliable method to determine
phase-solubility profiles of the studied systems.

However and
contrary to what we described for native CD aqueous
solutions,34 this method was not capable
of detecting CD aggregate formation and determine the possible modulation
of these inclusion complexes on the self-assembly process of the CDs.
The precipitation of inclusion complexes (that occurs for B-type profiles)
and the increase of the systems osmolality due to increase of CBZ
concentration makes it difficult to interpret deviations that occur
in total osmolality of these systems (e.g., osmolality can decrease
due to precipitation of components, presence of aggregates, etc.).

2.4 Solubility of Native and HP Derivatives in
the CBZ Media
To find a plausible justification for the osmolality
depression observed in previous chapter, the possible effect of CBZ
on CD complexes solubility was accessed. Graphical representations
of added CD concentration against actual CD concentration (CD concentration
in liquid phase after equilibrium) during phase-solubility studies
are provided in Figures 5 and 6. Bisectors (described by solid lines)
representing the theoretical situation where added CD concentrations
equals that in solution were also included in the figures.

of α- and γCD (a) and βCD (b) solubility
in the prepared CBZ/CD systems. Symbols represent mean ± SD (n = 3).

Figure 6 Illustration of HP-CDs
solubility in the prepared CBZ/HP-CD systems.
Symbols represent mean ± SD (n = 3).

For CBZ/αCD and CBZ/βCD, no significant
difference
is observed between added αCD/βCD concentration and the
concentration at the end of experiment (Figure 5).

A different behavior was observed
for γCD where no changes
in added and actual CD concentration are observed initially in the
linear region diverting from the bisector after approximately 0.014
M γCD (Figure 5a). After saturation concentration of CBZ/γCD inclusion complex
is achieved (matching with the point of diversion from bisector),
the plateau region is reached and precipitation of the complex (consequently
also CD) takes place. When solid CBZ is no longer available in the
system, the additional amount of CD provided will lead to its accumulation
in liquid phase. This phenomenon explains the increase in actual γCD
concentration visible in Figure 5a after the plateau region (from ∼0.037 M).

Figure 6 shows that
CBZ, as expected by AL phase-solubility profile, did not
have any influence and changed the solubility of HP-CDs over the phase-solubility
experiment. This can be explained by the formation of complexes with
high aqueous solubility.

2.5 Permeation Studies
For these experiments,
two representative CBZ/CD systems were selected: native γCD
and HPβCD. These represent two of the most promising candidates
for formulation of CBZ as they display the highest CE, apparent K1:1 and IS of the studied CDs. Furthermore,
they represent two distinctly different phase-solubility profiles
(BS and AL-type, respectively) and are used
in the pharmaceutical field. Thus, it is important to achieve more
knowledge on the possible influence that guests and inclusion complexes
can have on the self-assembly behavior of these CDs. Knowing more
about how guests with different physicochemical properties can modulate
the solubility and aggregation process of CDs complexes, we can try
to disclose driving factors that can promote or prevent the formation
of these structures.

This fits in one of the goals we set for
this work, the detection and quantification of CD aggregation in the
selected systems (through apparent cac values). From permeation studies,
the apparent cac cannot be defined as the concentration where CDs
start to assemble in larger structures (CD aggregates) but rather
the concentration at which the size starts to be a hindering factor
for free flow of CDs through the membrane (i.e., the aggregates size
becomes greater than the molecular weight-cutoff (MWCO) pore size
of the membrane tested and the cac determined is thus dependent on
the choice of MWCO of the membrane).

2.5.1 Hydroxypropylated
βCD
The
potential effect of CBZ on HPβCD aggregation behavior was estimated
through Franz diffusion cell permeability studies using liquid phases
from phase-solubility studies. For this group of experiments, 3.5–5
kDa membrane was used and the flux of HPβCD from CBZ/HPβCD
systems was determined. Afterward, the flux values were plotted versus
HPβCD concentration and a tangent line to the flux curve was
drawn to determine the concentration point from where the flux curve
started to divert from linearity. This estimated value corresponds
to the apparent cac value for this MWCO pore size membrane.

Sink conditions35 were fulfilled for this
set of experiments (both HPβCD and γCD) as donor phases
did not register significant volume changes (were always less than
0.1 mL), and CD concentration in the end of permeability experiments
(donor phase) was always higher than 90% of initial concentration.

In Figure 7, it
is possible to observe the flux curves for HPβCD aqueous solutions
(filled squares) and for HPβCD from CBZ/HPβCD liquid phases
(open circles). The flux behavior of HPβCD aqueous solutions
was previously studied by our group.36 Apparent
cac value for this system with 3.5–5 kDa MWCO membrane (the
same as for the present study) was determined to be 11.8% (w/v). This
means that until the apparent cac value HPβCD and any formed
aggregates permeated freely through the membrane to the receptor phase
because they did not have a particle size hindering their diffusion
through the membrane pores. Knowing that the molecular weight of HPβCD
is approximately 1.36 kDa, we could estimate from the apparent cac
that the aggregates consisted of approximately 3–4 HPβCD
monomers at cac.

Figure 7 Flux profile of HPβCD from HPβCD aqueous solution
(filled
squares) and CBZ/HPβCD liquid phases (empty circles) through
3.5–5 kDa MWCO semipermeable membrane.

It is understandable from Figure 7 that no significant difference could be
found between
HPβCD flux curves from HPβCD solutions and HPβCD
from CBZ/HPβCD. Apparent cac values (for 3.5–5 kDa) for
the CBZ/HPβCD systems was estimated to ∼11.6% (w/v) which
is similar to the one found for pure HPβCD solutions. The presence
of CBZ did not affect or promote the formation of HPβCD aggregates
with larger sizes than the one that are naturally formed in HPβCD
aqueous solutions. Altogether, these results suggest that CBZ did
not affect the self-assembly process of HPβCD.

2.5.2 Native γCD
Similar to what
is described above, the flux curve of γCD from CBZ/γCD
liquid phases was plotted against actual γCD concentration and
compared with the flux curve from γCD aqueous solution (Figure 8). The apparent cac
value (3.5–5 kDa MWCO) for both systems was calculated and
used to study the possible effect of CBZ on natural aggregation of
γCD.

Figure 8 Flux profile of γCD in aqueous γCD solution (filled
squares) and γCD from CBZ/γCD liquid phases (empty circles)
through 3.5–5 kDa MWCO semipermeable membrane.

Small but significant differences are noticeable
when the flux
curve for γCD in aqueous solution (filled squares) is compared
with the one from γCD from CBZ/γCD samples (Figure 8). γCD flux in aqueous
solution increased linearly until a concentration of 4.2% (w/v) (apparent
cac value for 3.5–5 kDa) after which a negative deviation probably
due to the formation of aggregates and increased in size of aggregates
is observed. Beyond this, γCD concentration aggregates are most
likely assembled in sizes larger than the membrane pore size selected
for this study, hindering the free flux of γCD from donor to
receptor phase. We can estimate that after 4.2% (w/v) γCD (MW
1297 Da) solutions, we have aggregated populations of trimers and/or
tetramers.

Regarding γCD from CBZ/γCD system, we
can observe that
flux values after a certain γCD concentration significantly
dropped in comparison to γCD in aqueous solution. This observation
was supported by a decrease in the apparent cac value which was estimated
to 2.5% (w/v). Until this value, aggregates of γCD and CBZ/γCD
complexes could be present in the solution with a maximum size of
dimers or trimers which are not large enough to make size a permeation
limiting factor. After 2.5% (w/v) of γCD, the flux deviated
from linearity as CBZ started to promote the formation of larger structures
with sizes larger (more than 3 monomers) than the membrane pore size
used in this study (3.5–5 kDa).

The CBZ/γCD system
displayed a BS-type diagram
in the phase-solubility studies, and it is interesting to note the
apparent cac value (for 3.5–5 kDa) and the γCD concentration
at which highest solubility of CBZ/γCD complex coincides. This
suggests that the BS-type profile and decrease in apparent
CBZ solubility after the plateau region might be related to the aggregate
formation of the complex that starts to precipitate out of solution
as solid crystalline complexes after this concentration have been
reached.

All the collected data strongly suggest that CBZ had
an influence
on the promotion of γCD aggregates formation. Similar results
were reported in previous publication where indomethacin37 and parabens15 proved
to influence γCD aggregation and modulate its permeation profile.

2.5.3 Influence of HPβCD and γCD on
Permeation Behavior of CBZ
In previous chapters (2.5.1 and 2.5.2),
we described the influence of CBZ on the permeability and aggregation
profile of HPβCD and γCD complexes. In the present one,
we want to investigate the opposite effect, that is, how these two
CDs may affect the permeability of CBZ.

Both CDs were capable
of forming inclusion complexes with CBZ and thus capable to increase
CBZ flux when compared with CBZ alone (in aqueous solution). Figure 9 exemplifies the
CBZ flux variation for CBZ/HPβCD samples (Figure 9a) and for CBZ/γCD samples (Figure 9b) versus its respective
measured CBZ concentration.

Figure 9 Flux profile of CBZ from CBZ/HPβCD liquid
phases (a) and
of CBZ from CBZ/γCD liquid phases (b) through 3.5–5 kDa
MWCO semipermeable membrane.

Previously, we proved using permeation data that CBZ was
not able
to modify the natural HPβCD permeation profile and to promote
any influence over HPβCD aggregation. Through evaluation of Figure 9a, we can see a linear
increase of CBZ flux with CBZ concentration (following Fick’s
first law) promoted by the CBZ/HPβCD compared with CBZ SE. HPβCD
is able to increase and facilitate the flux of CBZ molecules from
donor to receptor chamber (higher amount of CBZ/HPβCD complexes
led to increase of CBZ apparent solubility).

Contrarily, CBZ
flux from complexed CBZ/γCD did not present
a linear relation with γCD concentration (Figure 9b). Also, here a possible correlation of
phase-solubility type profile (BS-type) with the CBZ flux
profile (from CBZ/γCD system) can be used to explain the peculiar
shape presented. This flux curve starts with two points with relatively
high flux values (0.03%/3.5 × 10–4 and 0.048%/4.5
× 10–4) corresponding to the linear part of
phase-solubility experiment for this system. The presence of increasing
amount of soluble CBZ/γCD inclusion complexes with γCD
concentration justifies the increase of CBZ apparent water solubility,
as well as the observed flux linear increase. However, it stops as
soon as saturation concentration of complex is achieved. This point
is depicted in Figure 9b as the one presenting simultaneously highest flux and also highest
CBZ concentration (0.073%/6.1 × 10–4).

Afterward a region where CBZ concentration decreases (due to the
precipitation of CBZ/γCD complexes) and simultaneously the flux
(increasing presence of γCD aggregates) with increasing actual
γCD concentration can be observed. The points analyzed corresponded
already to plateau region and beyond. We know that γCD concentration
in solution is stable along plateau part and slowly starts to increase
after it (the amount of available γCD in the liquid phase at
this stage will depend on the solid CBZ added at the beginning of
experiment). If γCD would not affect permeability of CBZ (other
than facilitate it by increasing its solubility), we should observe
an overlapping with previously described CBZ flux points. This means
that samples with same CBZ concentration should present same flux
values, however, that did not happen because those samples have also
different amounts of γCD which probably explains the peculiar
shape flux curve registered.

From the analysis of these results,
it is possible to suggest that
when the γCD concentration is increased in solution, more and
larger aggregates were formed. These superstructures might be the
involved on the precipitation of inclusion complexes and by a decrease
of CBZ in liquid phase as a consequence. Their presence in the donor
phase might hamper the diffusion of matter from donor to receptor
phase leading to the marked drop of CBZ flux shown in Figure 9b.

Our finding that formulations
based on inclusion complexes of CBZ/γCD
providing similar concentrations of CBZ (but using different amounts
of γCD) can be produced with different permeability capacities
can be an advantage to the pharmaceutical research field. It might
be a useful tool especially for ocular or dermal delivery as different
types of drug delivery systems can be produced just by using different
concentrations of γCD (or other native CDs) in the formulation
(Figure 10).

and CBZ (B). Adapted from ref (39).

We can hypothesize that
small amounts of γCD (until plateau
region) will allow the production of formulations with fast permeation
of components (mainly constitutes by monomers and small aggregates).
On the other hand, formulating with higher γCD concentrations
(over plateau region and beyond), γCD and CBZ/γCD complex
aggregates with larger size and in higher number are formed. The inclusion
complex permeability will be slowed down and, consequently, sustained-permeation
delivery systems can be produced.

3 Conclusions
Several interesting conclusions could be made from this experimental
work. The phase-solubility data could be fitted to a model based on
simple 1:1 complex formation suggesting, as previously presented by
other authors, that CBZ formed 1:1 complexes with all tested CDs.
This does not prove that 1:1 complexes are formed and are responsible
for the appearance (linearity) of the phase-solubility curves. It
only signifies that the data can be fitted to a model for complex
formation based on a simple 1:1 stoichiometry. The lowest apparent
solubility increase was obtained for αCD which almost did not
interact with CBZ because of small cavity size (although it displayed
AL-type), and for γCD which formed complexes with
limited water solubility (BS-type), CD cavity size of the
native CDs showed to be an important factor for the better solubilization
of the drug, increasing with increasing diameter (αCD ≪
βCD < γCD).

Expectedly, hydroxypropylated CD
derivatives also displayed AL-type. Because of the larger
applicable range of CD concentrations,
the solubility enhancement achieved for CBZ can reach higher values
than that of their correspondent parent CDs.

HPβCD was
the best solubilizer agent for CBZ forming the
complexes with highest solubility and was most stable (K1:1 = 3296.3 M–1 and CE = 2.3). γCD
proved to be the best option from native CDs to solubilize CBZ (K1:1 = 928.9 M–1; CE = 0.66
and IS = 69.9%/mM).

Overall the solid-state characterization
techniques, as well as
osmometry data, provided similar conclusions and were supportive of
liquid phase results (phase-solubility, osmolality, and permeation
studies). However, in this study, osmometry was not capable to reveal
any possible influences of CBZ and its complexes on the aggregation
behavior of the CDs (and consequently to determine apparent cac values).
Nevertheless, osmometry is a fast and reliable method to corroborate
or determine phase-solubility profiles.

Permeation studies have
shown to be an extremely useful tool to
study aggregation and permitted the calculation of apparent cac values
for both HPβCD and γCD systems.

CBZ did not affect
or promote the self-assembly process of HPβCD
contrary to γCD where CBZ had a clear influence on the formation
of its aggregates.

HPβCD had a clear influence on the
CBZ flux, increasing linearly
with CBZ concentration due to the increase of complexes formed facilitating
permeation of CBZ through the membrane. For γCD, aggregates
significantly changed the flux of CBZ through the semipermeable membranes
because samples with similar CBZ concentration but with different
concentrations of γCD present completely different permeation
abilities as opposed to overlapping of flux curves (more and larger
aggregates were formed when γCD concentration increased yielding
lower permeability and consequently lower overall flux).

4 Materials and Methods
4.1 Materials
The
native CDs (αCD,
βCD, and γCD) as well as 2-hydroxypropyl-βCD (HPβCD)
DS 4.2 (MW 1380) were kindly provided by Janssen Pharmaceutica (Beerse,
Belgium). 2-Hydroxypropyl-αCD (HPαCD) with degree of substitution
3.6 (MW 1180) and 2-hydroxylpropyl-γCD (HPγCD) DS 4.2
(MW 1540) were purchased from Wacker Chemie (Burghausen, Germany).
CBZ was also kindly provided by Janssen Pharmaceutica (Beerse, Belgium).
The solvent used for analysis (acetonitrile) was of high-performance
liquid chromatography (HPLC) grade and obtained from Sigma-Aldrich
(St. Louis, Missouri, USA). Milli-Q water (Millipore, Billerica, MA)
was used to prepare CD solutions and mobile phases.

4.2 CD Solutions Preparation
Different
aqueous CDs stock solutions (taking into account the intrinsic solubility
of CD being tested) were prepared. To promote faster dissolution of
the CDs, sonication at elevated temperature was used (60 °C/60
min) after which solutions were allowed to cool to room temperature.
The test solutions were then prepared by dilution of these stock solutions.
The CD concentration range depended on the specific CD.

4.3 Quantitative Determination of CD/CBZ
A reverse-phase
ultra-HPLC (UHPLC) system from Dionex Softron GmbH
(Germering, Germany) was used for the simultaneous determination of
CBZ and CDs. The Ultimate 3000 series consisted of a LPG-3400SD pump
with a built-in degasser, a WPS-3000 autosampler, a TCC-3100 column
compartment, and a Corona ultra RS detector. Phenomenex Kinetex C18
150 × 4.60 mm 5 μm column with a matching HPLC Security
Guard (Phenomenex, Cheshire, UK) was used. Acetonitrile and water
(50:50) were the components of mobile phase. The flow rate was set
to 1.0 mL/min, and temperature of the column was set to 30 °C.
The injection volume was 10 μL. Chromatograms were evaluated
using ChromeleonR version 7.2 SR4 (ThermoFisher Scientific, MA, USA).

4.4 Phase-Solubility Experiments
Phase-solubility
profiles for the CBZ/CD systems were achieved using the isothermal
saturation method. Solid CBZ was added in excess amount (that assure
the formation of solid phase in equilibrium stage) to each vial together
with 3 mL of CD solution of given concentration. This methodology
was used for all six CDs tested and was performed in triplicate.

The formed suspensions were kept at 25 °C under constant stirring.
After reaching equilibrium (48 h), the mixture was centrifuged for
10 min/3000 rpm using Rotina 35R (Hetich Zentrifugen, Germany). Liquid
phases were filtered through a 0.45 μm Phenex-RC filter (Phenomenex,
Cheshire, UK) and then diluted with Milli-Q water prior to UHPLC analysis.
Solid phases were collected and dried in an oven at 35 °C for
two days.

The Higuchi and Connors30 method was
used to classify the phase-solubility profiles. The apparent stability
constant (K1:1,eq 1) and the CE (eq 2) were determined from the slope of the linear phase-solubility
diagrams plots of the total drug solubility ([Dt]) versus total concentration of CD in liquid phase ([CDliq]) in moles per liter26 1   2  where S0 is the
intrinsic solubility of the CBZ.

The maximum increase (in percentage)
in apparent solubility of
CBZ per mM of CD (increase in solubility, IS) for each CBZ/CD system
was determined as follows (eq 3) 3  where CBZmax corresponds to highest
solubility of complex and CDmax corresponds to the actual
concentration of CD needed to achieve it (measured in the liquid phase
at equilibrium). This value was calculated and is valid for linear
part of phase-solubility diagrams.

4.5 Osmolality
Measurements
Osmolality
measurements were used to evaluate the aggregation behavior of the
CBZ/CD systems. To determine the osmolality of liquid phases, a freezing
point osmometer OSMOMAT 30 (Gonotec GmbH, Germany) was used. Calibration
was performed with three points: Milli-Q water and by saline standard
of 300 or 400 mOsmol/kg NaCl/H2O (KNAUER, Germany) depending
on concentration range of analyzed samples. For this procedure, only
50 μL of the sample was required. Samples were measured immediately
after filtration of liquid phases to avoid possible precipitation
of components during storage.

4.6 Permeation
Studies
Unjacketed Franz
diffusion cells with diffusion area of 1.77 cm2 (SES GmbH—Analyse
systeme, Germany) were used to determine the possible influence of
CBZ on γCD and HPβCD apparent cac values and the effect
of these CDs on the capability of CBZ to penetrate semipermeable membranes.

12 mL of Milli-Q autoclaved water (to remove dissolved air) were
used as receptor phase, while the donor phase consisted in 2 mL of
different liquid phases (from phase-solubility experiments). In between
the two compartments, a 3.5–5 kDa MWCO semipermeable cellulose
ester membrane (Biotech CE, Spectrum Europe, Breda, NL) was placed.
All permeability experiments were carried out at room temperature
under continuous magnetic stirring (300 rpm) of receptor phase (donor
phase was unstirred).

Sampling was initiated after 1 h for γCD
and 0.25 h for HPβCD
after which the amount of CBZ diffused into the receptor phase was
above the quantification limit. Samples were withdrawn every 15 min
hereafter at determined time points: 60–120 min for γCD
and from 15 to 75 min for HPβCD, 150 μL of sample was
collected from the receptor phase and immediately replaced by equal
volume of Milli-Q water. UHPLC was used to simultaneously quantify
CD and CBZ. Steady-state flux (J) of the CBZ/CD was
calculated from the slope (dq/dt) of the linear regression relationship between time (t) and the amount of CBZ and CD in receptor phase (eq 4) 4  where A is the diffusion
area (1.77 cm2), Papp is the
apparent permeability, and Cd is the total
CBZ/CD concentration in the donor phase.

To assure sink conditions,
common guidelines were followed, where
both volume change and final concentration of components in donor
phases were assessed.35,38

The calculation of the
apparent cac for 3.5–5 kDa (i.e.,
concentration from where aggregates size starts to be larger than
the studied pore size, leading to a deviation of ideal flux of CDs
through the membrane) was performed by drawing tangent lines in the
flux graphics (starting at low concentrations). The deviation point
from where the flux started to divert from linearity corresponded
to apparent cac value.34
