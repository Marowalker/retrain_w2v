This study aimed
to reveal the flow and
distribution lows of chemical oxygen demand (COD) and nitrate–nitrogen
under different main anoxic stage oxidation–reduction potential
(ORPan) conditions based on the analysis of material balance
in each reaction stage of the modified university of cape town (MUCT)
process, combined with the biochemical reaction principles of activated
sludge. The rule of the carbon source saving effect was also clarified.
The study adopted the programmable logic controller automatic control
system and the feedback control structure using the inner circulation
flow of nitrate as the controlled variable. The ORPan setting
values of control parameters were −140, −125, −110,
−95, −70, and −60 mV, respectively. The results
showed that when the ORPan setting value was −95
mV, COD distribution ratios of phosphorus-accumulating bacteria reached
the highest in the anaerobic stage and preanoxic stage, with the values
of 51.74 and 7.70%, respectively. The COD was distributed between
heterotrophic bacteria and denitrifying bacteria in the main anoxic
stage, and the distribution ratios were 4.40 and 7.19%, respectively,
when the ORPan setting value was −95 mV. The study
also showed the distribution of nitrate–nitrogen between denitrifying
bacteria and denitrifying phosphorus-accumulating bacteria in the
main anoxic stage, and when ORPan increased from −140
to −60 mV, the distribution ratios of denitrifying phosphate-accumulating
bacteria increased from 76.46 to 86.32%. When there was no denitrification
and phosphorus absorption, the acetic acid dosage increased from 20.33
g/d at −140 mV to 24.76 g/d at −95 mV, and the carbon
source saving rate increased from 23.19 to 26.56% under similar conditions.
Therefore, in the MUCT process, the regulation of ORPan changed the material flow direction and mass quality distribution
of COD and nitrate nitrogen. When ORPan set value was −95
mV, COD and nitrate–nitrogen got the best distribution and
the carbon source saving effect was the most significant.

1 Introduction
In
order to alleviate water
pollution, nitrogen and phosphorus removal is required in the process
of municipal sewage treatment, but most of the time, the ratio of
carbon–nitrogen and carbon–phosphorus ratio in municipal
sewage are gradually decreasing, thereby making the removal of nitrogen
and phosphorus difficult.1,2 Generally, in the synchronous
biological nitrogen and phosphorus removal system of sewage, phosphorus-accumulating
bacteria, nitrifying bacteria, and denitrifying bacteria coexist to
complete for the process of phosphorus release, phosphorus absorption,
nitrification, denitrification, and other biochemical reactions. However,
the growth environment of each strain is quite different, resulting
in a variety of contradictory relations.3−10 In recent years, autotrophic denitrification
technology has gradually gained massive attention for its efficiency
in the treatment of low carbon–nitrogen ratio sewage. However,
because hydrogen production bacteria, sulfur bacteria, and iron bacteria
are autotrophic bacteria, the growth and reproduction rate is relatively
low, and they often need a large volume; thus, they have not been
applied in urban sewage treatment plants.11,12 In
the 1990s, researchers discovered that denitrifying phosphorus-accumulating
bacteria exists in the anoxic stage of the sewage treatment plant.
The stable metabolic process of the bacteria could alleviate the above
contradiction to a certain extent.13−20 The electron acceptor of denitrifying phosphorus-accumulating
bacteria is nitrate–nitrogen, and its metabolic characteristics
are the same as those of common phosphorus-accumulating bacteria.21−23 However, after nearly 20 years
of development, the process of denitrifying phosphorus uptake has
not completely solved the problem of poor effect of simultaneous nitrogen
and phosphorus removal in low carbon/nitrogen (C/N) ratio wastewater,
mainly because the quality and the quantity of influent water fluctuate
greatly and the operating parameters of the sewage plant cannot respond
immediately, and the denitrifying phosphorus-accumulating bacteria
cannot reach the optimum state. The above problems can be solved to
a certain extent by constructing a denitrifying phosphorus absorption
process control system and developing control parameters and optimum
control strategy in the sewage treatment plant.24

In the construction of the control system, the real-time,
stable, and accurate detection of control parameters are very important.
Presently, the control parameters commonly used in sewage treatment
plants include dissolved oxygen (DO), pH, and oxidation–reduction
potential (ORP) values, among which DO is used to control the air
supply of the blower in the aerobic stage, whereas the pH value is
used to monitor the operation of the system, and ORP is used to monitor
the REDOX environment in the nonaerated stage. The ORP online detector
has the advantages of on-line detection, fast response, high control
accuracy, and easy access to the computer.24−28 In the field of environmental engineering, many countries
and regions in the world have taken ORP value as one of the important
detection indicators for disinfection of swimming pool water, drinking
water, and hot spring water, and some experts and scholars have applied
ORP to industrial process control.29−31 Over 90% of wastewater treatment plants for nitrogen
and phosphorus removal in China are equipped with ORP online measuring
instruments in the nonaerated section, which is used to monitor the
redox level of the treatment environment and avoid the high oxygen
content affecting the phosphorus release and denitrification effect.
However, there are few reports on its regulation as a process control
parameter of continuous sewage biological treatment system. Among
them, Ma and Peng studied the feasibility of realizing the optimal
control of denitrification process by using ORP as the fuzzy control
parameter of denitrification reaction in anoxic/aerobic activated
sludge process and obtained the conclusion. They showed that, when
the internal circulation flow rate was controlled separately, the
ORP value at the end of denitrification zone was (−86 ±
2) mV; and when the external carbon source was controlled alone, the
ORP value was (−90 ± 2) mV.32 In preliminary studies, researchers took low carbon–nitrogen
ratio sewage as the treatment object and studied the feasibility of
ORPan as the control parameter of the continuous flow single
sludge sewage treatment system. It has been determined that regulating
the parameter can change the total phosphorus (TP) and total nitrogen
(TN) concentration of the system effluent and at an optimal value
of −95 mv.25 On this basis, the
metabolism of poly-hydroxy alkanoates (PHA) and TP under different
ORPan conditions was discussed.33 In order
to meet the needs of constructing denitrifying phosphorus absorption
process control system and strengthen and stabilize denitrifying phosphorus
absorption performance, this paper traces the flow and distribution
of carbon and nitrogen under different ORPan conditions
and evaluates the carbon source savings produced by ORPan as the operation control parameter. Mainly, the research is based
on the biochemical reaction process of common heterotrophic bacteria,
denitrifying bacteria, nitrifying bacteria, and phosphorus accumulating
bacteria, combined with the principle of material balance.

2 Test Materials and Methods
2.1 Sewage
Water Quality Characteristics
The pollutant composition and
concentration in the manually configured
sewage to be treated in modified university of cape town (MUCT) process
system were determined by referring to the water quality of 10 sewage
treatment plants in Changchun City, northern China.1,2,34−37 The dosage of each substance
was 50 mg/L of whole milk powder, 0.5 mL/L of brewery wastewater,
50 mg/L of NH4Cl, 3.1 mg/L of KH2PO4, 0.4 g/L of NaHCO3, 10 mg/L of CaCl2, and
50 mg/L of MgSO4, respectively. In order to meet the growing
needs of activated sludge, 0.6 mL/L of micronutrient solution was
added, including 0.9 g/L of FeCl3, 0.15 g/L of H3BO3 and CoCl2·7H2O 0.15 g/L,
CuSO4·5H2O 0.03 g/L, KI 0.18 g/L, CoCl2·4H2O 0.06 g/L, Na2MoO4·2H2O 0.06 g/L, and zinc ZnSO4·7H2O 0.12 g/L.

2.2 Main Operating Parameters
of MUCT Device
As shown in Figure 1, the MUCT test system
consisted of a 252 L sewage tank, 90 L MUCT reactor, precipitator
with a diameter of 50 cm, and automatic control system. The size of
the sewage tank was 80 cm × 70 cm × 45 cm (L × B ×
H), and the super height is 5 cm. The MUCT reactor was 75 cm ×
30 cm × 45 cm (L × B × H), with a 5 cm super height.
This included the anaerobic stage of 18 L, preanoxic stage of 9 L,
main anoxic stage of 18 L, and aerobic stage of 45 L. The reactor
was designed as a double gallery; each gallery was divided into five
compartments with partition plates. The effective volume of each compartment
was 9 L, and the size was 15 cm × 15 cm × 45 cm (L ×
B × H). The stirrer was installed in the sewage tank and nonaerated
section, and the air diffuser was arranged in the aerobic section.
The mixed liquid of the reactor flowed into the precipitator for solid–liquid
separation. The settling device was equipped with a scraper with a
rotating speed of 5 rpm. The MUCT system established an automatic
control system, which consisted of ORP on-line detector, DO on-line
detector, the programmable logic controller (PLC), computer, and electric
control valve.

2.3 Test
Scheme
The daily water treatment capacity of the test system
was 240 L/d. Water quality parameters were assessed according to German
(ATV-DVWK Specification),38 the design
of Municipal Wastewater Treatment Plants (Volume 2: Liquid Treatment
Processes) of United States,39 the Dutch
Biological Phosphorus Removal Manual for Design and Operation, and
Chinese Outdoor Drainage Design Specification (GB50014) (2016 edition).40 According to the regulations, operation parameters
such as sludge load, hydraulic retention time, and sludge age were
determined. “Chinese Outdoor Drainage Design Specification”
(GB50014) (2016 edition) takes hydraulics, microbiology, and so forth
as the scientific support and combines with the engineering design
and operation experience of China’s urban drainage system,
to analyze the design parameters. It is the design standard of the
urban drainage system in China.

During the experiment, ORPan was controlled by the PLC automatic control system. The
control system adopted a feedback control structure, the control parameters,
controlled variables, and the actuators were ORPan, the
internal circulation flow rate of nitrate, and electric control valve,
respectively. The control process was as follows: the ORP value was
detected by an ORP online measuring instrument at the end of the main
anoxic stage (the output signal was 4–20 mA analogue signal),
transmitted to the data acquisition card of PLC system. After being
converted into a digital signal by A/D converter and compared with
ORPan setting value of proportional–integral–derivative
regulator, the deviation was determined. Next, after the control of
proportional, integral, and differential calculation, the results
were given and converted into analogue signals (4–20 mA) by
a D/A converter. As the output value, the results were fed back to
the internal circulation electric control valve of nitrate. The Scientific
Apparatus Maker’s Association (SAMA) diagram and logic control
diagram of the automatic control system are shown in Figure 2. The experiment was carried
out in six stages with ORP set values of −140, −125,
−110, −95, −75, and −60 mV. The other
operating parameters remained unchanged except the internal circulation
flow of nitrate. Three sludge retention time were operated in each
stage for 250 days. See Table 1 for the test scheme. The sludge retention time (SRT) was
controlled by the hydraulic method; a peristaltic pump was used for
continuous discharge of excess sludge from the main anoxic section
at a rate of 7.5 L/d.26

day of inoculation.

2.4 Activated Sludge Inoculation and
System Startup
During the system startup, see Table 1 for operation parameters of
the MUCT system, the recirculated sludge from the secondary sedimentation
tank of Changchun Beijiao sewage treatment plant was added to the
reactor for continuous operation after inoculation, and the activated
sludge was cultured and domesticated. The concentration of water quality
indicators was tested every day.

2.5 Detection
Indicators and Methods
During
the experiment, the samples were taken from anaerobic, preanoxic,
main anoxic, and aerobic stages, respectively. After water samples
were taken out and centrifuged at 4500 rpm for 7 min, the concentration
of chemical oxygen demand (COD), TP, TN, NH4+–N, and NO3–N in the supernatant was determined.
The content of PHA in sludge after freeze-drying was determined by
gas chromatography.37,41−43 The DO concentration in the main anoxic
section was measured using a WTW-pH/OXi340 portable DO detector. DO
in the aerobic section was regulated by PLC automatic control system,
and the value of the DO detector was read as the test result. The
data used in the analysis of the test results were taken from the
indexes for 20 days during the stable operation period of each section.
Chemical samples used in this study are shown in Table 2.

2.6 Material
Balance Analysis
Based on
the principle of material balance, each reaction section was taken
as the boundary of the system, and the amount of material reaction
was calculated using the substance detection concentration. The results
were expressed as mean ± error bar.

Assuming that the amount
of material accumulated during the stable operation of the system
was 0, the formula is as follows;

Anaerobic stage 1  

Preanoxic stage 2  

Main anoxic stage 3  

Aerobic stage 4  where subscripts 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and
5 represent inlet water, anaerobic stage, preanoxic stage, main anoxic
stage, aerobic stage, and outlet water, respectively; ΔS denotes the amount of material reaction, g/d; Q represents inflow flow, L/d; V represents
the effective volume of the reactor, L; S denotes
the concentration of substance, mg/L; s represents
sludge reflux ratio; a represents aerobic/main anoxic
nitrifying fluid circulation ratio; and r denotes
preanoxic/anaerobic mixture circulation ratio.

2.7 Chemometrics
and Coefficient of Reaction Process
The biochemical reaction
processes of MUCT process included COD
aerobic degradation, anaerobic phosphorus release, denitrifying phosphorus
absorption, aerobic phosphorus absorption, denitrification, and nitrification.
COD in sewage is expressed by empirical molecular formula C18H19O9N.

The empirical molecular formula
of cell material is C5H7NO2, and
the empirical molecular formula of PHA is CH1.5O0.5. The chemical equation for the oxidation of C18H19O9N to CO2 is shown in eq 5.fd544 Formula 5 shows that the oxygen equivalent of C18H19O9N was 1.42 gCOD/gC18H19O9N. 5  

The chemical equation for the oxidation
of PHA to CO2 is shown in eq 6. Formula 6 shows that the COD
equivalent of PHA was 1.67 gCOD/gCH1.5O0.5. 6  

The biochemical reaction equation for aerobic degradation of COD
is shown in eq 7. According
to the formula, the stoichiometric coefficient of O2–C18H19O9N–COD was 2.19 gCOD/gO2. 7  

The denitrifying biochemical reaction equation using COD as a carbon
source is shown in eq 8. It can be seen from the formula that the stoichiometric coefficient
of NO3–C18H19O9N–COD was 0.18 gNO3/gCOD, and the stoichiometric
coefficient of NO3–COD–C18H19O9N–NO3 was 5.35 gCOD/gNO3. 8  

The denitrifying biochemical reaction equation using acetic
acid as a carbon source is shown in eq 9. According to the formula, the stoichiometric coefficient
of C2H4O2–NO3 was
5.10 gC2H4O2/gNO3. 9  

3 Test Results
3.1 Start-Up
After 37
days of continuous operation, the nitrification effect of the system
was good, the activated sludge showed a strong ability of phosphorus
release and absorption, the effluent concentration of TN and TP were
below 20 and 1 mg/L, respectively, and the activated sludge had been
cultured and domesticated. The biological phase of the activated sludge
sample was examined by a microscope, and it was found that the characteristics
of the activated sludge bacterial micelles were good.

In a previous
study (2015)45 based on the principle of
chemometrics, the proportion of main microorganisms in the MUCT process
was calculated by using material balance: 35.94% of common heterotrophic
bacteria, 16.84% of denitrifying bacteria (with COD as carbon source),
41.54% of phosphorus accumulating bacteria (of which, denitrifying
phosphorus accumulating bacteria accounted for 20.63%), and 5.78%
of nitrifying bacteria. The operation parameters and influent water
quality of the above study were similar to that of the start-up period
(8–37 d), especially in the later period (25–37 d).
In addition, because the two studies were carried out in the same
set of MUCT system test device, the above calculation results can
be used as the microbiological basis for qualitative analysis in this
paper.

3.2 ORPan and System Performance
During the test, the change rule
of COD, nitrogen, phosphorus and other pollution index concentration,
and PHA content in sludge in each reaction section of the system are
shown in Figure 3.
The errors of the measured values were less than 2 mV. It can be seen
from Figure 3 that
when the carbon–nitrogen ratio of the influent water was low,
the setting value of ORPan could be adjusted and controlled,
which had little influence on COD, ammonia nitrogen, and nitrite–nitrogen.
The effluent concentration changed in the range of 10.26–23.65,
1.16–4.54, and 0–0.03 mg/L, respectively. However, the
effluent concentration of TN, TP and nitrate–nitrogen was greatly
affected by the regulation of ORPan setting value. The
effluent concentration was 12.06–24.58, 0.21–5.03, and
8.67–22.34 mg/L, respectively. When the ORPan set
value was −95 mV, the effluent concentration of the three was
the lowest. Therefore, it can be inferred that −95 mV was the
best setting value.

index in each stage
of the MUCT process. (a) COD variation; (b) PHA variation; (c) TP
variation; (d) TN variation; (e) NO4+–N
variation; (f) NO3––N variation.
Note: ☆ in (f) indicates the concentration of nitrite nitrogen
of AS (effluent).

In addition, the removal rates of three
pollutants were determined based on the calculation results of the
material balance of COD, TN, and TP. When the ORP setting value was
controlled at −140, −125, −110, −95, −75,
and −60 mV, the removal rates of COD were basically stable,
238.26 ± 24.95 mg COD/(gMLSS·d); the removal rates of TN
were 28.45 ± 3.52, 29.99 ± 1.23, 31.05 ± 0.94, 35.02
± 0.83, 34.52 ± 1.08, and 34.11 ± 2.04 mg TN/(gMLSS·d),
TP were 3.26 ± 0.22, 3.98 ± 0.82, 4.83 ± 1.45, 5.48
± 0.76, 5.38 ± 0.45, and 5.20 ± 0.63 g TP/(gMLSS·d),
respectively. The results showed that the COD removal rate was not
affected by ORP regulation value but TN and TP changed significantly.
When ORP regulation value was −95 mV, both of them reached
the highest values, which also confirmed that −95 mV was the
best setting value.

During the test, with the main anoxic section
as the system boundary, the TP concentration detection value was used
to calculate the phosphorus absorption, and the results are shown
in Figure 4. It can
be seen from Figure 4 that with the increase of ORPan, the phosphorus absorption
rate in the main anoxic stage increased from 2.57 ± 1.41 g TP/(gMLSS·d)
to 13.07 ± 0.52 mg TP/(gMLSS·d). This indicated that the
regulation of ORPan could enhance the function of denitrifying
phosphorus-accumulating bacteria and obtained better denitrifying
phosphorus absorbing effect.

Figure 4 Absorption amount of TP in the main anoxic stage.

3.3 ORPan and the
Quality Distribution of COD and Nitrate–Nitrogen
3.3.1 ORPan and
COD Mass Distribution
Based on material balance analysis
and stoichiometry, the mass distribution of COD in each stage was
tracked. When ORPan was controlled as −140 mV, the
mass distribution of carbon and nitrogen in each reaction section
was calculated using the average value of the calculated results of
material balance.

Anaerobic stage:

The amount of COD stored
in the synthesized PHA is CODANS,PHA is as follows 10  

COD
consumption in the denitrification process is CODANS,DE is 11  

Preanoxic stage:

COD consumption in the denitrification process
is CODPAnS,DE is 12  

The amount of COD stored in synthetic PHA is CODANS,PHA is 13  

Main anoxic stage:

The amount
of COD degraded by the aerobic method is CODMAnS,O is 14  

COD
consumption in the denitrification process is CODMAnS,DE is 15  

The amount of nitrate–nitrogen
(NO3) MAnS,COD using COD as a carbon source
is 16   17  

Using the same method and procedure, the material
distribution of COD in a nonaerated section can be calculated when
ORPan was controlled to be −125, −110, −95,
−70, and −60, respectively. The results are shown in Figure 5. Because of the
need to regulate ORPan in each test stage, the circulation
ratio of nitrate was a variable, and its value was the average value
of the output of the automatic control system, which was 1.23 ±
0.13, 1.51 ± 0.25, 2.34 ± 0.09, 3.23 ± 0.06, 3.37 ±
0.17, and 3.59 ± 0.10, respectively. It can be seen from Figure 5a that when ORPan was increased from—140 to −95 mV, the amount
of COD in anaerobic section synthesized into PHA and stored in phosphorus-accumulating
bacteria was increased from 27.01 to 35.57 gCOD/d, and the distribution
rate was increased from 39.63 to 51.74%. When denitrifying bacteria
were used to transform nitrate nitrogen, the amount of COD decreased
to 0.75 g COD/d at −140 mV, and the flow rate was 1.10%. When
the control value was −95 mV, the denitrifying bacteria did
not obtain COD.

Figure 5 Material
distribution of carbon and nitrogen in different stages [average values
with confidence bands (n = 20, P = 0.683]. (a) Distribution of COD in the anaerobic stage; (b) distribution
of COD in anaerobic preanoxic stage; (c) distribution of COD in the
main anoxic stage; (d) distribution of nitrate–nitrogen in
main anoxic stage. Note: figures in (a) showed the percentage of COD
distributed to phosphate accumulating bacteria and denitrifying bacteria
in the anaerobic section of the process; figures in (b) showed the
percentage of COD distributed to phosphate accumulating bacteria and
denitrifying bacteria in the preanoxic stage of the process; figures
in (c) showed the percentage of COD distributed to phosphate accumulating
bacteria and denitrifying bacteria in the main anoxic stage of the
process; figures in (d) showed the percentage of NO3––N distributed to phosphate accumulating bacteria
and denitrifying bacteria in the main anoxic stage of the process.

Then again, when ORPan was set at
−140 and −125 mV, the COD allocated to phosphorus-accumulating
bacteria was 0 (Figure 5b). Thereafter, with the increase in ORPan value, the
amount of COD allocated to phosphorus-accumulating bacteria increased.
When the set value was −95 mV, the storage capacity of PHA
and the allocation rate of COD reached the highest values of 1.39
g/d and 2.51%. Correspondingly, the amount of COD allocated to denitrifying
bacteria decreased with the increase of ORPan. When the
set value was −95 mV, the consumption and distribution rate
of denitrifying bacteria reached the lowest values of 5.29 g/d and
7.70%.

From Figure 5c, it can be deduced that the distribution ratio of COD between
denitrifying bacteria and heterotrophic bacteria changes regularly
with the increase of ORPan. When the control value increased
from −140 to −60 mV, the distribution ratio of COD to
common heterotrophic bacteria increased, and the distribution ratio
was 1.52, 2.10, 2.15, 4.40, 4.13, and 4.60%. Correspondingly, the
COD to denitrifying bacteria decreased. The distribution rates were
10.13, 9.65, 9.28, 7.93, 7.19, and 6.15%, respectively.

To sum
up, the flow and distribution of COD in MUCT process mainly occur
in anaerobic, preanoxic, and main anoxic stages, where the distribution
of COD in anaerobic and preanoxic stages was between phosphorus-accumulating
bacteria and denitrifying bacteria. The distribution of COD in the
main anoxic stage was between the common heterotrophic bacteria and
denitrifying bacteria. The distribution proportion varied regularly
with the difference of ORPan.

3.3.2 ORPan and Nitrate–Nitrogen
Mass Distribution
When ORPan was set at −140
mV, the flow direction of nitrate–nitrogen in the main anoxic
stage was calculated as Section 3.3.1. Using the same method and procedure,
the distribution of nitrogen in the main anoxic stage was calculated
when ORPan was controlled as −125, −105,
−95, −70, and −60 mV, respectively. The results
are shown in Figure 5d. With ORPan increasing from −140 to −60
mV, the amount of nitrate–nitrogen transformed by denitrifying
bacteria gradually decreased, at distribution rates of 23.54, 20.86,
19.89, 16.76, 15.10, and 13.68%, respectively. Correspondingly, nitrate–nitrogen
transformed by denitrifying phosphorus-accumulating bacteria was increased,
at distribution rates of 76.46, 79.14, 80.11, 83.24, 84.90, and 86.32%,
respectively. That is to say, when ORPan control was −95
mV, most of nitrate–nitrogen flowed to denitrifying phosphorus
accumulating bacteria, and the system experienced the best effect
of nitrogen and phosphorus removal.

3.4 ORPan and Carbon Source Savings
With the assumption of
no denitrifying phosphorus uptake, when
ORPan was controlled at −140 mV, the required amount
of acetic acid (C2H4O2)ECS could be calculated according to formula 9. 18  

Under similar method and procedure as previous, we can calculate
the amount of acetic acid as external carbon sources required when
ORPan was controlled as −125, −105, −95,
−70, and −60 mV, respectively, without anoxic phosphorus
absorption. The results are shown in Figure 6. From the results, the amount of acetic
acid added increased from 20.33 to 24.76 g/d when ORPan was increased from −140 to −95 mV. In other words,
carbon sources can be saved during the process of phosphorus absorption
by denitrification, and the carbon source saving rate increased from
23.19 to 26.56%. Subsequently, the dosage of acetic acid remained
stable or decreased slightly with the increase of ORPan.

4.1.1 ORPan and
the Mass Distribution of COD
From
the perspective of microbiology and metabolism, in the sewage biological
treatment system, the dynamic changes of activated sludge microbiome
structure and dominant microbiome were closely related to the ORP
of their living environment,37 and the
dominant reaction process was also quite different,41 as shown in Figure 7. In addition, the regulation of ORP altered the content of
NADH/NAD+ and NADPH/NADP+ in bacterial metabolism
and activated some key enzymes, thereby changing the metabolic network
of substances.37 Combined with the experimental
results, when ORPan was set at −95 mV, the nitrate–nitrogen
reaction and phosphorus absorption in the main anoxic stage were the
highest, as shown in Figures 6 and 4. This indicated that the ORPan value was the appropriate ORP range for denitrifying phosphorous
accumulating bacteria, activated nitrate reductase, and PHA degrading
enzyme in the bacteria to the greatest extent, which enhanced the
function of denitrifying phosphorous-accumulating bacteria.

There are many kinds of redox potentials in the main anoxic section
of MUCT system, which is a complex redox system. ORP is the comprehensive
result of the redox reaction of many kinds of redox substances and
redox substances. From the macroenvironment, the main oxidizing substances
are oxygen and nitrate nitrogen, and the reducing substances are COD.
Therefore, ignoring other redox processes, the ORP in the main anoxic
section can be calculated by the Nernst equation, as shown in formulas 19 and 20 19   20  where E is the ORP value in the main anoxic section; Eθ is the standard electrode potential; R is the general gas constant; n is the number of
transferred electrons; T is the temperature; F is the Faraday constant; and C [NO3], C [O2], and C [COD] are the relative values of the three concentrations
to the standard concentrations. Generally, the concentration is taken
for calculation; 4.54, 0.61, 8, and 1 are the stoichiometric coefficients
of the reaction, respectively, as shown in formulas 7 and 8. It can be seen from the formula
that ORPan in the main anoxic section is closely related
to DO concentration, nitrate concentration, COD concentration, and
pH value in this section.46 During the
test, the DO concentration in this section was stable between 0.08
and 0.09 mg/L, and the COD concentration was stable between 18.19
and 22.30 mg/L, with little change; the pH value was stable between
7.17 and 7.71, and the variation pattern is shown in Table 3. Therefore, it can be inferred
that the change of ORPan value was mainly caused by the
concentration of nitrate–nitrogen, reflecting its concentration
level. Based on the activated sludge reaction kinetic model 2D (ASM2d),
Wang et al.47 established the MUCT process
reaction kinetic model and checked and verified the kinetic parameters
and stoichiometric coefficients. They also determined that the values
of kinetic parameters qPHA, KA, KPP, YPO3, μAUT, and ηNO were 2.90 g·(g·d)−1, 3.85 g·m–3, 1.35 g·(g·d)−1, 0.35,
1.6, and 0.8, respectively. Other kinetic parameters and stoichiometric
coefficients adopt the default values recommended by IWA. According
to the model, the denitrification phosphorus-absorption performance
was determined by the nitrate–nitrogen concentration in this
section, which was also proved by the research of Wang and Musvoto
et al.24,25

In order to make the most effective
use of the denitrifying phosphorus uptake potential in the main anoxic
stage, it was necessary to ensure that the nitrate–nitrogen
concentration in the main anoxic stage is not too low or zero and
not be too high. Explicitly, there was an optimum concentration range
of nitrate–nitrogen and a corresponding optimum range in ORPan. When the concentration of nitrate–nitrogen in the
main anoxic stage varied from 0.5 to 2.5 mg/L (ORPan was
between −140 and −95 mV), the process of denitrifying
phosphorus uptake became more complete with the increase of the set
value. Nevertheless, when the concentration of nitrate–nitrogen
was higher, thus ORPan was greater than −95 mV;
the internal circulation flow rate of nitrate solution needed to control
the value increased. Therefore, the amount of DO entering this section
increased (even when DO concentration changed slightly), also the
actual hydraulic retention time was shortened, resulting in the inadequate
realization of denitrification and phosphorus uptake process.

In the main anoxic stage, COD was distributed between heterotrophic
bacteria and denitrifying bacteria and the distribution proportion
was mainly determined by the DO consumption amount. According to formula 3, when the ORPan control value increased
from −140 to −60 mV, the DO reactions were 0.47, 0.65,
0.67, 1.38, 1.27, and 1.44 gO2/d, respectively. Therefore,
with the increase of ORPan control value, the COD flow
to heterotrophic bacteria increased, whereas the COD flow to denitrifying
bacteria decreased (see Figure 5). Figure 8 shows the flow direction of COD and nitrate nitrogen in the nonaerated
reaction section when ORPan was controlled at −140
and −95 mV, respectively, showing the distribution ratio of
COD and nitrate nitrogen as well. The distribution ratio of COD was
the ratio between the distribution amount and total COD reaction amount,
and the proportion of nitrate nitrogen distribution was the ratio
between the distribution amount and the reaction amount of nitrate
nitrogen in the main anoxic stage.

Figure 8 Flow direction
of COD
and nitrate nitrogen in nonaerated reaction section when ORPan was controlled at −140 and −95 mV.

In anaerobic stage and preanoxic
stage, with nitrate–nitrogen present, COD would be distributed
to denitrifying bacteria and phosphorus accumulating bacteria, respectively,
and the distribution proportion was affected by the competition between
denitrifying bacteria and phosphorus accumulating bacteria. It has
been reported that denitrifying bacteria are dominant in this competition.43 When ORPan was controlled at a low
value, the denitrification and phosphorus absorption potential in
the main anoxic section had not been fully developed, and the nitrate–nitrogen
concentration in the effluent was high. This caused the nitrate–nitrogen
amount in the pre anoxic section to increase, while more COD flowed
to denitrifying bacteria and few or almost no phosphorus accumulating
bacteria. For example, when ORPan control was −140,
−125, −110 mV, there was no PHA synthesis and storage
in the pre hypoxia section, and the distribution proportion of phosphorus
accumulating bacteria was 0; but when increased to −95, −70,
and −60 mV, some COD flowed to phosphorus accumulating bacteria
to synthesize PHA (see Figure 5). It can be seen from Figure 8 that when ORP was −140 mV, the COD allocation
rate of phosphorus accumulating bacteria in the preanoxic stage was
0%, and denitrifying bacteria was 11.37%; when ORP was −95
mV, the COD allocation rate of phosphorus accumulating bacteria in
this stage was increased to 2.52%, and denitrifying bacteria was reduced
to 7.70%.

4.1.2 ORPan and
Mass Distribution of Nitrate–Nitrogen
According to
the principle of stoichiometric reaction, the COD flowing
to denitrifying bacteria decreased and the consumption of nitrate–nitrogen
decreased under conditions of increased ORPan control value.
In addition, the performance of denitrifying phosphorus uptake in
the main anoxic zone was enhanced with the increase in ORPan control value. Hence, the amount of nitrate–nitrogen transformed
by denitrifying phosphorus-accumulating bacteria increased as well.
The distribution and proportion (distribution ratio) increased similarly,
as shown in Figure 5. The nitrate–nitrogen distribution ratio of denitrifying
bacteria was 23.54% and that of denitrifying phosphorus-accumulating
bacteria was 76.46% when the ORPan control value was −140
mV. Similarly, when the ORPan control value was −95
mV, the denitrifying bacteria distribution ratio decreased to 16.76%
and that of denitrifying phosphorus-accumulating bacteria increased
to 83.24%, as shown in Figure 8.

On the other hand, the competition between denitrifying
bacteria and phosphorus-accumulating bacteria was enriched when nitrate–nitrogen
was circulated to the anaerobic stage with mixed liquor. Compared
with the situation without nitrate, the amount of COD consumed by
denitrifying bacteria and the amount of phosphorus-accumulating bacteria
absorbed were both transformed as shown in Figure 4. Therefore, the COD distribution ratio was
also changed, as shown in Figure 8.

4.2 ORPan and Carbon
saving
Assuming that the
absence of denitrifying phosphorus uptake in the main anoxic stage
of MUCT process, the nitrate–nitrogen consumed by the anaerobic
growth of phosphorus-accumulating bacteria needed to be transformed
by denitrifying bacteria, which required the addition of external
carbon sources to achieve the same treatment effect (denitrifying
phosphorus uptake took place). Specifically, there was a denitrifying
phosphorus absorption process, which reduced the number of external
carbon sources. In the wastewater treatment process, the common external
carbon sources are methanol and acetic acid, which are simple, economical,
and practical organic substances. The dosage of acetic acid as a carbon
source was determined by stoichiometry (see Figure 7). In the MUCT process, with the increase
of ORPan control value, the denitrification and phosphorus
absorption performance could be enhanced, and more nitrate–nitrogen
would be removed in this process. Therefore, more external carbon
sources were saved. When ORPan was controlled to −95
mV, the highest carbon saving rate was 26.56%. This result was lower
than the 50% saving rate obtained by Kuba et al.,48 but close to 24.29% of Wang when the internal circulation
ratio of nitration liquid was 3.0 and the internal circulation ratio
of mixed liquid was 1.5.49 Kuba et al.
run the double sludge A2NSBR system in the laboratory:
one was A/ASBR operated by anaerobic/anoxic mode to achieve denitrification
and phosphorus removal; the other was NSBR operated by aerobic mode
to carry out nitrification. At the end of nitrification, the effluent
entered into anoxic SBR. In the A2NSBR system, denitrifying
phosphorus-accumulating bacteria and nitrifying bacteria were completely
separated, which had the best denitrifying phosphorus absorption performance.
Therefore, the carbon source saving rate was also very high. In the
MUCT process operated by Wang et al., the internal circulation ratio
of nitration liquid was constant at 3.0, which was basically close
to the value controlled in this paper when ORP was −95 mV,
so the carbon source saving effect of the two processes was also similar.

5 Conclusions
In summary, this study assessed
the distribution rate of COD between
denitrifying bacteria and phosphorus-accumulating bacteria in anaerobic
and preanoxic stages. The results proved that when the ORPan set value was −95 mV, the distribution rate reached the highest,
51.74 and 7.70%, respectively. COD in the main anoxic segment was
distributed between ordinary heterotrophic bacteria and denitrifying
bacteria. When ORPan set the value of −95 mV, the
distribution proportion was 4.40 and 7.19%, respectively. In addition,
the distribution of nitrate–nitrogen between denitrifying bacteria
and denitrifying phosphorus-accumulating bacteria in the main anoxic
stage decreased from 1.24 to 0.98 g/d with the increase of ORPan from −140 to −95 mV. Meanwhile, the amount
of nitrate–nitrogen transformed by denitrifying phosphorus-accumulating
bacteria increased from 4.03 to 5.18 g/d under similar conditions.
Again, with the increase in ORPan control value, the acetic
acid dosage increased from 20.33 g/d at −140 mV to 24.76 g/d
at −95 mV, and the carbon source saving rate increased from
23.19 to 26.56%, and then remained stable.

From this study,
the MUCT process can achieve good operation status and better carbon
saving effect by regulating ORPan. Future studies should
consider building a control system of the denitrification phosphorus
absorption process to examine and realize the regulation function
of this parameter.
