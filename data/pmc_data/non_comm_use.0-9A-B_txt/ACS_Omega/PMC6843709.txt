Much of the research
effort concerning layered materials is directed
toward their use as building blocks for the development of hybrid
nanostructures with well-defined dimensions and behavior. Here, we
report the fabrication through layer-by-layer deposition and intercalation
chemistry of a new type of clay-based hybrid film, where functionalized
carbon nanotubes are sandwiched between nanometer-sized smectite clay
platelets. Single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) were covalently
functionalized in a single step with phenol groups, via 1,3-dipolar
cycloaddition, to allow for stable dispersion in polar solvents. For
the production of hybrid thin films, a bottom-up approach combining
self-assembly with Langmuir–Schaefer deposition was applied.
Smectite clay nanoplatelets act as a structure-directing interface
and reaction media for grafting functionalized carbon nanotubes in
a bidimensional array, allowing for a controllable layer-by-layer
growth at a nanoscale. Hybrid clay/SWCNT multilayer films deposited
on various substrates were characterized by X-ray reflectivity, Raman,
and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopies, as well as atomic force microscopy.

Introduction
Over the last decades, the industrial
and scientific interest in
layered materials has been mainly driven by their physical and chemical
properties, resulting from the reduced dimensionality of the individual
layers. Their structural characteristics and in particular their high
surface area, combined with their unique (opto)electronic properties,
render layered materials ideal for a wide range of applications in
electronics,1 nanosensing,2 gas separations,3 and energy
storage,4 as well as in biomedical technology
and drug delivery.5,6

Layered aluminosilicate
minerals (smectite clays) consisting of
platelets, where an aluminum oxide octahedral sheet is sandwiched
between two silicon oxide tetrahedral sheets, belong to the phyllosilicate
family and exhibit a unique combination of properties including the
ability to swell when put in contact with water, to adsorb molecules
and organic/inorganic cationic moieties from solutions and to exchange
cations located between the platelets.7,8 The cation
storage ability renders clay minerals an excellent template for embedding
molecules and nanomaterials and forms the basis for the development
of hybrids and nanocomposites with well-defined dimensions and behavior.7

On the other hand, carbon nanotubes (CNTs)
are unique in their
aspect ratio, mechanical strength, and electrical and thermal conductivities;
therefore, they are an ideal nanomaterial for light-emitting diodes,
smart windows, solar cells, nanofillers, self-healing thermoset/CNT
nanocomposites, etc.9−11 The integration of CNTs within two-dimensional (2D)
materials (such as graphene and MoS2) generates hybrid
superstructures with improved mechanical stability and enhanced thermal
and electrical properties due to the synergistic effects of 2D and
one-dimensional materials.12−15 Thus, the synthesis of hybrid nanomaterials, combining
the properties of carbon nanotubes and layered materials with high
surface area, has great potential for applications in the fields of
catalysis,16,17 sensing,12,16,18 optoelectronics,15,19 and biomedicine.16,20

Studies reported so far
on the development of clay–CNT hybrid
superstructures concern mainly their use as additives to increase
the mechanical properties of polypropylene21 and epoxy resin,22,23 as well as in styrene–butadiene
rubber nanocomposites24 and as additives
in Nafion polymer matrixes for electrolyte nanocomposite membranes.25 In addition, clay–CNT hybrids reduce
significantly the electrical percolation threshold26 and improve the electrical conductivity when incorporated
in polypropylene and epoxy matrixes.27 Moreover,
due to the synergistic effect of clay nanoplatelets and carbon nanotubes,
these hybrid structures have been proposed as flame retardants in
unsaturated polyester resins and poly(methyl methacrylate)28,29 as well as adsorbents for the removal of bacterial contaminants
from different water supplies.30

In this work, we propose a simple and low-cost method for the development
of hybrid clay multilayers accommodating functionalized single-walled
carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) based on the combination of Langmuir–Schaefer
(LS) deposition and self-assembly.31−33 SWCNTs, functionalized
with phenol groups by 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition (SWCNTs-f-OH), were
sandwiched between natural nanometer-sized clay platelets through
layer-by-layer deposition to yield novel pillared structures with
structural control at the molecular scale. An amino surfactant (dimethyldioctadecylammonium
(DODA) bromide, [CH3(CH2)17]2(CH3)2N+Br–) was injected on top of an aqueous suspension of Na-montmorillonite
(Kunipia-F) in the Langmuir–Blodgett trough to induce the formation
of a hybridized Langmuir film at the air-suspension interface. After
the transfer of the compressed Langmuir film by horizontal dipping
(Langmuir–Schaefer method), the substrate was immersed in a
dispersion of SWCNTs-f-OH to prompt self-assembly. Hybrid multilayer
films hosting SWCNTs within the interlayer space between clay platelets
were fabricated by repeating this cycle for numerous times (Scheme 1) with the help of
a robotic arm. These novel clay-based hybrid films could be excellent
candidate nanomaterials for potential application as electrical conductivity
improvers,34,35 mechanical properties reformers,21,22 nanoadditives in direct methanol fuel cells, or even as contaminant
removal nanomaterial.25 Moreover, when
dispersed in a polymer matrix, clay–CNT additives create thermoprotection
layers for electronics and enhance the proton conductivity.36 Carbon nanotubes attached to smectite layers
are also particularly attractive for polymer reinforcement37,38 and the high surface area of these hybrid nanomaterials can be exploited
for the removal of bacterial contaminants from different water supplies.39

Results and Discussion
Structural
and Morphological Characterization of SWCNTs-f-OH
The Fourier
transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra of pristine SWCNTs
and functionalized SWCNTs-f-OH are shown in Figure 1 (top center panel). In contrast to pristine
SWCNTs, which are infrared inactive, additional vibrations are observed
in the SWCNTs-f-OH spectrum. In more detail, C–H stretching
bands appear at 804 cm–1 and between 3000 and 2800
cm–1; C=C stretching bands are observed around
1600–1380 cm–1, while the bands located at
1260 and 3320 cm–1 are attributed to the C–O
and O–H stretching modes. Together, these vibrational fingerprints
testify to the successful functionalization of SWCNTs with phenols.
As a result of the covalent sidewall functionalization9,40,41 with hydroxyl groups, the dispersibility
of SWCNTs-f-OH in polar solvents is higher compared to that of pristine
SWCNTs as observed in the photographs shown in Figure 1 (left panels).9

Figure 1 (Left)
Schematic representation of SWCNT functionalization via
1,3-dipolar cycloaddition and photographs of suspensions of the two
types of SWCNTs in DMF. (Top) FT-IR (center) and Raman (right) spectra
of pristine SWCNTs (a) and SWCNTs-f-OH (b). (Bottom) Differential
thermal analysis/thermogravimetric (DTA/TG) curves of pristine SWCNTs
(a) and SWCNTs-f-OH (b).

Raman spectra of SWCNTs-f-OH
and pristine SWCNTs are shown in Figure 1 (top right panel).
For both materials, the defect-induced D band appears at 1335 cm–1 and the G band splits into two modes, ωG– at 1545
cm–1 and ωG+ at 1590 cm–1, resulting
from the characteristic confinement and curvature of carbon nanotubes.42−49 The ID/IG ratio of pristine SWCNTs and SWCNTs-f-OH was calculated to amount
to 0.07 and 0.10, respectively. The slightly higher value for SWCNTs-f-OH
agrees with the change in hybridization resulting from the covalent
attachment of phenol moieties to the sidewall of nanotubes; however,
the ID/IG of
SWCNTs-f-OH is very low as expected for a high-quality graphitic structure.9,41

The differential thermal and thermogravimetric analyses of
SWCNTs
before and after functionalization are shown in Figure 1 (bottom center and bottom right panels).
In the case of pristine nanotubes, one sharp exothermic peak at 480
°C is observed, followed by the complete decomposition of the
graphitic lattice, while for SWCNTs-f-OH, two main exothermic peaks
are seen. The first peak at 365 °C is attributed to the removal
of aliphatic groups and the corresponding weight loss is estimated
to be ∼33 wt %, while the second peak at 490 °C corresponds
to the thermal decomposition of the graphitic network with a mass
loss of ∼51 wt %. These results provide further evidence for
the successful covalent functionalization of the SWCNTs.

Structural
Control and Characterization of Hybrid DODA–Clay/SWCNTs-f-OH
Monolayers
∏−A isotherms of
DODA monolayers on pure water and on the Kunipia suspension were recorded
during the compression of the Langmuir films and are shown in Figure 2. The curves show
the phase transitions of the DODA layer and the DODA–clay hybrid
layer from 2D gas to condensed liquid and then to 2D solid during
the compression process.31−33 In the absence of clay, the ∏−A isotherm smoothly increases with a lift off area of 164
Å2. When using aqueous clay suspensions as the subphase,
the lift-off area of the isotherms increases to higher values, testifying
to the adsorption of DODA cations on the clay nanoplatelets and thus
to the hybridization of the clay platelets with the DODA molecules.50,51

Figure 2 (Left) Π–A isotherms
of DODA Langmuir films on pure water and on Kunipia aqueous suspensions.
(Right) Atomic force microscopy (AFM) height images and cross-sectional
analysis of DODA–clay monolayers deposited with the LS technique
onto Si wafers at surface pressures of (a) 5 mN m–1, (b) 10 mN m–1, (c) 15 mN m–1, and (d) 20 mN m–1 during the compression process.

The precise control over the packing density of
hybrid Langmuir
films (DODA–clay) was verified by AFM as shown in Figure 2 (right). Representative
AFM images of DODA–clay monolayers deposited at surface pressures
of 5, 10, 15, and 20 mN m–1 onto Si wafers by the
LS technique revealed that the surface coverage scales with the surface
pressure. More specifically, the topographic images of DODA–clay
monolayers deposited at the lowest surface pressure (Figure 2a) reveal the uniform distribution
of isolated clay sheets. When the Langmuir film was compressed to
10 mN m–1 (Figure 2b) for deposition, the clay platelets start to contact
each other but with still rather large voids between them, and deposition
at even higher surface pressures of 15 mN m–1 (Figure 2c) and 20 mN m–1 (Figure 2d) leads to a denser and more compact packing of the clay
sheets. The average thickness of all deposited monolayers of DODA–clay
is 1–2 nm as derived from topographical height profile (section
analysis) corresponding to the size of single clay layers.50

Representative AFM images of the transferred
hybrid DODA–clay/SWCNTs-f-OH
monolayers are shown in Figure 3, together with the topographic image of SWCNT-f-OH deposited
by drop-casting from a DMF dispersion. The functionalized SWCNT-f-OH
has a diameter of 3 nm, as revealed from the cross-sectional analysis
(bottom right panel of Figure 3), suggesting that the addition of phenol groups in the sidewalls
of nanotubes was successful and provided well-dispersed and isolated
SWCNTs avoiding aggregation due to the covalent addition of −OH
groups. On the other hand, the AFM images presented in the top panels
of Figure 3 (top) demonstrate
that clay nanoplatelets decorated with SWCNTs on the top are successfully
transferred to form a layer of (mostly) single platelets with well-defined
edges that are almost contacting each other and with small voids between
them. The average diameter of the attached SWCNTs on the clay platelets
is 3 nm as calculated from the cross-sectional analysis, in agreement
with the size of the SWCNTs-f-OH prepared by 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition.

Figure 3 AFM height
images (top) and cross-sectional analysis (bottom) of
the DODA–clay/SWCNTs-f-OH hybrid monolayer and functionalized
SWCNT-f-OH.

The SWCNT-f-OH attached on the
DODA–clay layers are shorter
than the pristine SWCNTs because during ultrasonication treatment,
the acoustic waves induce a carbon nanotube scission.52 Moreover, during the Langmuir–Schaefer procedure,
the lower-molecular-weight carbon nanotubes float on the surface when
the substrate is immersed in the aqueous dispersion of SWCNTs-f-OH
to prompt self-assembly, in addition to the heavier (and longer in
size) ones that sink and do not interact with the substrate.

Characterization
of Clay/CNTs Hybrid Thin Films
X-ray
reflectivity (XRR) patterns collected from 40 layers of DODA–clay–DODA
and DODA–clay/SWCNTs-f-OH deposited at a surface pressure of
20 mN m–1 are presented in Figure 4. The reflectivity curve for DODA–clay–DODA
clearly exhibits a prominent (001) Bragg peak at 2.3° (±0.1°),
as well as the (002), (003), (004), and (005) Bragg peaks. These features
prove that the DODA molecules are grafted on both sides of Kunipia
nanoplatelets after the LS procedure, revealing a very well-ordered
lamellar structure with a d(001)-spacing
of 38.4 Å as calculated from the Bragg law and in agreement with
our previous results.50 The XRR of DODA–clay/SWCNTs-f-OH
hybrid multilayer on the other hand displays the 001 (n = 1), 002 (n = 2), and 003 (n =
3) diffractions at lower 2θ values, demonstrating that the interlayer
distance of the clay nanoplatelets increased due to the incorporation
of SWCNTs-f-OH. In more detail, the DODA–clay/SWCNTs-f-OH hybrid
multilayer shows a 001 diffraction peak at 2θ = 1.9° (±0.1°),
resulting in a d001-spacing of 46.5 Å.
This value corresponds to an interlayer space of Δ = 46.5 –
9.6 = 36.9 Å, confirming the presence of SWCNTs-f-OH between
the clay platelets. In this case, the Bragg peaks are much broader
as a result of the disorder in the hybrid thin film due to the insertion
of the nanotubes in the DODA–clay interlayers.

Figure 4 (Left) XRR patterns of
DODA–clay–DODA and DODA–clay/SWCNTs-f-OH
hybrid multilayers (40 layers). (Right) Raman spectrum of DODA–clay/SWCNTs-f-OH
hybrid multilayer (40 layers).

The Raman spectrum of the DODA–clay/SWCNTs-f-OH hybrid multilayer
deposited on a Si wafer (40 layers) is shown in Figure 4 (right panel), revealing the characteristic
peaks of SWCNTs, namely, the defect-included D band, appear at 1335
cm–1 and the two degenerate modes of G band, ωG– and ωG+, at 1544 and 1590
cm–1, respectively. The small increase of the ID/IG ratio (0.22)
in the DODA–clay/SWCNTs-f-OH film compared to that of the SWCNTs-f-OH
(ID/IG = 0.10)
is attributed to the shorter length of SWCNTs-f-OH that is deposited
between the clay nanoplatelets,53,54 as was also observed
from the AFM study.

The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)
analysis is shown in Figure 5; the survey spectrum
(top panel) bears the fingerprint of all the characteristic elements
expected for the hybrid film. From the detailed spectra, we deduce
the following elemental composition: carbon 58.5%, oxygen 29.0%, silicon
11.0%, and nitrogen 1.5%.

Figure 5 XPS survey (top panel) of C 1s core level (central
panel) and N
1s core level (bottom panel) of a DODA–clay/SWCNTs-f-OH hybrid
multilayer (40 layers).

The C 1s core level XPS
spectrum of DODA–clay/SWCNTs-f-OH
is displayed in Figure 5 (central panel) and consists of five components, two peaks at a
binding energies of 284.0 and 285.2 eV, which were attributed to the
sp2 and sp3 hybrid forms of carbon from the
SWCNTs as well from the C–C organic chains of DODA molecules
representing both of them 76.7% of the whole carbon amount. A fitted
peak at 286.2 eV is due to the functionalization of SWCNTs-f-OH, with
hydroxyl groups filling 17% of the carbon spectra and attesting the
successful attachment of nanotubes with hydroxyl moieties. A very
weak photoelectron peak (2.3%) at 288.2 eV may be due to some C–O–C
or −COOH groups derived from the impurities absorbed on the
nanotubes. Finally, a weak peak at very low binding energies may arise
from some type of C–Si bond from the silica substrate or montmorillonite
Kunipia impurities.

The N 1s core level region in the photoelectron
spectrum (Figure 5,
bottom panel) confirms
the presence of functionalized SWCNTs between the Kunipia nanosheets9 (in agreement with XRR results) because the pyrrolidine
rings on the functionalized SWCNTs give rise to this spectrum. In
fact, the peak at 402.1 eV, accounting for 63.6% of the total N 1s
spectral intensity, originates from protonated nitrogen of the pyrrolidine
amines of SWCNTs-f-OH, and the nonprotonated pyrrolidine amines of
SWCNTs-f-OH are responsible for the contribution at 399.5 eV.

Conclusions
Hybrid thin films of SWCNTs, functionalized via 1,3-cycloaddition,
sandwiched between clay nanoplatelets, were successfully prepared
by combining the Langmuir–Schaefer deposition with self-assembly.
The efficiency of this approach in terms of coverage and single-layer-level
control of the assembly was confirmed by the ∏−A isotherms and AFM results. The incorporation of SWCNTs-f-OH
in the multilayer structure was confirmed by X-ray photoelectron and
Raman spectroscopies. In addition, the XRR measurements revealed that
the hybrid multilayer films present a well-ordered lamellar structure
with an interlayer space of 36.9 Å. These novel clay pillared
with SWCNTs constitutes an ideal synthetic approach for hybrids needed
in applications where a high surface area has to be combined with
specific functionalities in a well-defined structure, such as materials
for energy storage, sensing, catalysis, and nanomedicine. The fabrication
of hybrid thin films, combining the properties of 2D materials with
carbon nanotubes is a great promise for fabricating novel pillared
structures with modified, adjusted, or improved properties.

Experimental
Section
Materials
A synthetic sodium-saturated montmorillonite
Kunipia-F, with a chemical formula Na0.87[Al3.12Fe(III)0.20Mg0.61Ti0.01](Si7.90Al0.10)O20(OH)4 and cation-exchange
capacity of ∼119 mequiv g–1, was purchased
from Kunimine Industries Co. (Japan). Short-length single-walled carbon
nanotubes (SWCNTs, ≥90%) were purchased from mkNANO (Canada).
Dimethyldioctadecylammonium bromide (DODA, ≥98%), N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF, ≥99%), 3,4-dihydroxibenzaldehyde
(≥97%), acetone, methanol, and ethanol were purchased from
Sigma-Aldrich. N-Methyl-glycine (≥99%) was
purchased from Fluka. Ultrapure deionized water (18.2 MΩ) produced
by a Millipore Simplicity system was used throughout. The Si wafers
(P/Bor, single side polished, purchased from Si-Mat) were cleaned
prior to use by 15 min of ultrasonication in water, acetone, and ethanol.
All reagents were of analytical grade and used without further purification.

SWCNTs Functionalization
SWCNTs were functionalized
with phenol groups via 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition in a single step.55−57 More specifically, 25 mg of SWCNTs was suspended in 50 mL of DMF
by ultrasonication for 3 min. 250 mg of 3,4-dihydroxibenzaldehyde
and 300 mg of N-methyl-glycine were added in the suspension and the
mixture was refluxed at 155 °C for 7 days. After the reaction
was completed, the functionalized SWCNTs with phenol groups were separated
from the byproducts by vacuum filtration using poly(tetrafluoroethylene)
filter (from Sigma-Aldrich with a pore size of 0.2 μm and diameter
of 47 mm), washed several times with DMF and ethanol, and finally
air-dried.

Preparation of Hybrid Clay/CNTs Multilayers
A KSV 2000
Nima Technology Langmuir–Blodgett device was used for the preparation
and deposition of clay films at a temperature of 21 ± 0.5 °C.
Films were deposited on Si wafers, as depicted in Scheme 1. A 20 ppm clay (Kunipia-F)
suspension in ultrapure water (18.2 MΩ Millipore Q-grade) was
used as the subphase. To achieve the hybridization of the clay platelets,
100 μL of DODA–solvent mixture (0.2 mg mL–1) was spread onto the water–clay suspension with the help
of a microsyringe. After a waiting time of 20 min to allow the evaporation
of solvent, the hybrid DODA–clay Langmuir film was compressed
at a rate of 5 mm min–1 until the chosen stabilization
pressure of 20 mN m–1 was reached. This pressure
was maintained throughout the deposition process. Clay monolayers
were transferred onto the hydrophobic substrates by horizontal dipping
(Langmuir–Schaefer deposition), with downward and lifting speeds
of 10 and 5 mm min–1, respectively. In the final
step, the one-side organomodified clay films were lowered in SWCNTs-f-OH
(0.2 mg mL–1) dispersion to induce self-assembly.31−33 Hybrid multilayer thin films were prepared by repeating this procedure
40 times. After each deposition step, the substrates were rinsed several
times by dipping into ultrapure water and dried with nitrogen flow
to avoid contaminating the Langmuir film in Langmuir–Blodgett
trough and/or the SWCNTs-f-OH dispersion. For comparison, an organoclay
hybrid multilayer (40 layers) was also fabricated50 under the same experimental conditions, replacing the SWCNTs-f-OH
dispersion in the self-assembly step with DODA surfactant solution
in methanol (0.2 mg mL–1) (sample denoted as DODA–clay–DODA).

Characterization Techniques
FTIR spectra in the range
400–4000 cm–1 were measured with a PerkinElmer
Spectrum GX infrared spectrometer equipped with a deuterated triglycine
sulphate detector. Each spectrum was the average of 64 scans, collected
with 2 cm–1 resolution. Samples were in the form
of KBr pellets containing ca. 2 wt % sample. Raman spectra of SWCNTs,
SWCNTs-f-OH, and DODA–clay/SWCNTs-f-OH hybrid thin films deposited
on the Si wafer were collected with a micro-Raman system RM 1000 RENISHAW
using a laser excitation line at 532 nm (laser diode). A 0.5–1
mW laser power was focused on a 1 μm spot to avoid photodecomposition
of the hybrid films. Thermal and thermogravimetric analyses (DTA/TGA)
were performed using a PerkinElmer Pyris Diamond TG/DTA. Samples of
approximately 5 mg were heated in air from 25 to 850 °C at a
rate of 5 °C min–1. X-ray reflectivity patterns
were collected on a D8 Advance Bruker Diffractometer by using Cu Kα
(λ = 1.54 Å) radiation, a molybdenum (Mo) monochromator,
and a parallel beam stemming from a Göbel Mirror. They were
recorded in the 2θ range from 2 to 12°, with the stepping
count of 0.02° and the time between each step set to 2 s. Atomic
force microscopy (AFM) images were collected in tapping mode with
a Bruker Multimode three-dimensional nanoscope, using a microfabricated
silicon cantilever type TAP-300G, with a tip radius <10 nm and
a force constant of ∼20–75 N m–1.
Pristine SWCNTs-f-OH from DMF dispersion were deposited onto the Si-wafer
substrates by drop-casting (∼0.01 mg mL–1). The X-ray photoelectron (XPS) spectra were acquired in a surface
analysis ultrahigh-vacuum system (SPECS GmbH) equipped with a twin
Al-Mg anode X-ray source and a multichannel hemispherical sector electron
analyzer (HSA-Phoibos 100). The energy resolution was set to 1.2 eV
and the photoelectron take-off angle was 45° with respect to
the surface normal. All binding energies are given ±0.1 eV and
were referenced to the SiO2 core level at 103.5 eV.58,59 Spectral analysis was performed with the help of a least squares
curve-fitting program (WinSpec) developed at the Laboratoire Interdisciplinaire
de Spectroscopie Electronique, University of Namur, Belgium, and included
a Shirley background subtraction. The profile of the peaks was taken
as a convolution of Gaussian and Lorentzian functions. The average
uncertainty in the peak intensity determination is 3% for nitrogen
and 1% for carbon, silicon, and oxygen.
