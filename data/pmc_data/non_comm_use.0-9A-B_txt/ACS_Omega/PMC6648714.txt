We report on the photostability of
monolayer (1L) transition-metal
dichalcogenides (TMDCs) in air and in aqueous solutions, as probed
using photoluminescence spectroscopy. 1L-WSe2 was readily
degraded under continuous irradiation of visible light in aqueous
solutions, whereas 1L-MoS2 was relatively stable in both
ambient air and aqueous solutions. The stability difference between
these two materials was mainly ascribed to the oxidization reaction
at the interface of 1L-TMDCs and the O2/H2O
redox system induced by both band alignment and photogenerated holes.
This interpretation was strongly supported by the observation of the
lower degradation rate of 1L-WSe2 in the dark and in degassed
water with a lower concentration of dissolved oxygen compared with
the degradation rate of 1L-WSe2 in distilled water. Furthermore,
the degradation rate was also nearly proportional to the number of
photogenerated carriers. The degradation rate under acidic conditions
was smaller than that under the basic conditions. The results are
attributed to the oxidation/reduction potential of 1L-WSe2 and to the dissolution reaction of degraded species, both of which
are strongly pH-dependent.

Introduction
Monolayers (1L) of
transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) MX2, where M is
a transition metal (typically Mo or W) and X
is a chalcogen (typically S, Se, or Te), have emerged as new direct-gap
semiconductors with truly two-dimensional structures. Because of the
striking change in their electronic structures from indirect (>2L)
to direct band gap (1L) depending on their number of layers,1−3 1L-TMDCs show interesting optical and electrical properties which
have strong potential for use in future electronic and optoelectronic
devices such as phototransistors,4−9 photodetectors,10−12 light-emitting devices,13,14 light modulators,15 and solar cells.16−18 Tunable photoluminescence (PL) has thus far been demonstrated using
chemisorption and physisorption,19−22 covalent bonding,23,24 and electrostatic methods.25,26 The electronic properties
have also been studied using chemical doping and defect engineering.27−29 Additionally, the applications of 1L-TMDCs as gas sensors or biosensors
and photocatalysts for water splitting have been reported.30−35 Electrochemical etching or oxidation reactions of atomically thin
TMDCs under photoirradiation36,37 or ozone exposure38 conditions were also studied. These previous
studies suggest that deep understanding of the influence of surface
reactions on the physical properties and stability of 1L-TMDCs is
important for realizing their application in various environments
such as ambient air or wet conditions. However, knowledge of the stability
of 1L-TMDCs under such conditions is limited.

In this paper,
we report on the stability of the most typical 1L-TMDCs—1L-WSe2 and 1L-MoS2—in ambient air and acidic/basic
aqueous solutions under visible-light irradiation. The PL intensities
of 1L-WSe2 distinctly decreased in acidic/basic aqueous
solutions, whereas MoS2 was stable under the same conditions
and its PL intensity showed a negligible decrease. The PL spectral
shape did not show a remarkable change with increasing irradiation
time for either 1L-WSe2 or 1L-MoS2, suggesting
that the change in the PL intensity was not caused by photoinduced
carrier doping but was mainly attributable to photoinduced degradation.
We confirmed that the degradation rate was lower in the dark and in
degassed water than in distilled water, suggesting that both light
and dissolved oxygen are necessary for photodegradation reactions.
Furthermore, 1L-WSe2 under acidic and neutral conditions
showed a more moderate degradation rate than that under the basic
condition. These results suggest that the electrochemical reaction
with 1L-TMDCs and photogenerated holes in the presence of oxygen and
water is the key mechanism of the degradation. This mechanism is effective
for 1L-WSe2 and ineffective for MoS2 because
of the difference in the relative alignment among the oxidation/reduction
potentials of O2/H2O and the levels of the valence
and conduction bands of each 1L-TMDC.

Results and Discussion
Figure 1 shows the
schematic of the optical system for the PL measurements in air or
aqueous solutions. 1L-TMDCs prepared on a transparent glass substrate
(Figure S1) were irradiated with visible
wavelength light (580 nm) with a constant power density (800 W cm–2). The signal was recorded using a silicon charge-coupled
device (CCD) detector equipped with a spectrometer (see the Experimental Methods section for details).

Figure 1 Schematic of
the optical system for the PL measurement. White light
from a supercontinuum light source is separated using a monochromator
and optical filters, and only visible light with selected wavelength
is focused on to the sample on a glass substrate. The samples were
placed in air or in aqueous solution during the measurement.

Figure 2a,b shows
the PL intensity and the normalized PL spectra of 1L-WSe2 under ambient air at different photoirradiation times. As shown
in Figure 2a, the PL
intensity decreased slightly within 90 min under photoirradiation
(580 nm, 800 W cm–2, which is in the linear region
shown in Figure S2). By contrast, 1L-MoS2 showed a negligible change in PL intensity (Figure 2c). The normalized PL spectra
show an undetectable shape change in the spectra of both 1L-WSe2 and 1L-MoS2 (Figure 2b,d). Because the optical absorption coefficients
of 1L-TMDCs at 580 nm are similar (1 × 105 to 2 ×
105 cm–1),39,40 we expected
similar numbers of electrons and holes to be photogenerated in these
samples. Thus, these results imply that the stability of 1L-WSe2 is slightly lower than that of MoS2 in ambient
air under photoirradiation.

PL spectra (b,d)
in ambient air. (a,b) are for 1L-WSe2 and (c,d) are for
1L-MoS2.

Because the properties
of 1L-TMDCs are known to be strongly modified
by electrochemical effects at the surfaces,22,41 we next studied their stabilities in water under light irradiation.
Under these conditions, water molecules are adsorbed onto the surface
and electrochemical effects because the oxygen/water redox couple
becomes important.41 We first performed
PL measurements with the 1L-TMDCs in distilled water and then with
the 1L-TMDCs in acidic/basic solutions. As shown in Figure 3a,c, the PL intensity of 1L-WSe2 (Figure 3a)
in aqueous solution rapidly decreased with increasing irradiation
time, whereas the PL intensity of 1L-MoS2 (Figure 3c) was stable under all of
the investigated conditions. The main decrease of the 1L-WSe2 PL intensity under neutral (distilled water) and basic conditions
occurred within the first 10–15 min; the decrease then slowed,
likely because of the increased concentration of the degradation products
from 1L-WSe2. Under the acidic condition, as shown in Figure 3a, 1L-WSe2 exhibited a relatively moderate degradation rate, in contrast to
the fast degradation observed under other conditions. The original
PL intensities decreased by approximately 15, 40, and 55% within 10
min in acidic (pH = 2), neutral (pH = 7), and basic (pH = 12) conditions,
respectively. The normalized PL spectra of 1L-WSe2 and
1L-MoS2 show almost no change of the spectral shape within
the irradiation time as shown in Figure 3b,d. We also confirmed the photo-induced
degradation of 1L-WSe2 in water directly by observing optical
and PL images before and after the photoirradiation (Figure S3).

single- or double-exponential functions.

To elucidate the mechanism of the material-dependent degradation
behavior and the differences among degradation rates of the materials
in different environments, we consider O2/H2O redox couple and the electrochemical reaction at the interface
between aqueous solutions and 1L-TMDCs. The effects of O2 and H2O molecules on the optical and electrical properties
of the 1L-TMDCs were reported.22,41 The transfer of photogenerated
electrons or holes may be a main factor related to the degradation
or decomposition of the 1L-TMDCs in an O2/H2O system, depending on the band alignment of the semiconductors with
the oxidation/reduction potentials of O2/H2O.
In general, photogenerated holes (h+) can facilitate the
oxidation of compound semiconductors (AB)42 and destruct their original structures 1  where z represents
the number
of holes and solv is solvent. In the current study, A and B are the
transition metal and chalcogen that compose the semiconductors, respectively.

The band alignment of 1L-WSe2 relative to vacuum is
shown in Figure 4a.
The conduction-band minimum is near −3.6 eV, which is much
higher than the H+/H2 reduction potential (ca.
−4.83 eV).43−47 Thus, some of the photogenerated electrons can reduce H+ to H2. This process can also occur for 1L-MoS2 (Figure 4b), which
has a conduction-band minimum at approximately −4.1 eV;47,48 however, the smaller energy difference from ϕ(H+/H2) results in a lower electron driving force/rate to
reduce H+ to H2 in comparison with 1L-WSe2, as reported in previous studies.49,50 The valance-band edge of 1L-WSe2 is at approximately
−5.2 eV,47,51 which is higher than the O2/H2O potential (ca. −5.66 eV). Photogenerated
holes in WSe2 cannot totally recombine with the photogenerated
electrons because some of the electrons have already been used to
reduce H+ to H2. Thus, the excess amount of
holes degrades the 1L-WSe2 itself rather than oxygenating
H2O42,52 that is energetically unfavorable.
These processes are expressed in eqs 2 and 3(36,53,54) 2   3  

Figure 4 Band
alignment of (a) 1L-WSe2 and (b) 1L-MoS2 with
the water redox potential.

For 1L-MoS2, the valence-band maximum is at approximately
−6.0 eV which is lower than the potential of O2/H2O and some of the photogenerated holes may oxygenate H2O to O2. In this case, fewer excess holes remain
and MoS2 itself is not likely to be degraded within a short
time. Thus, we can explain the difference in the degradation behaviors
between 1L-MoS2 and 1L-WSe2. Specifically, the
change in pH results in a change of the redox potentials of the O2/H2O couple tested in this study (from −5.54
to −4.95 eV) between pH 2 and 12, and the oxidation and reduction
potentials for 1L-WSe2 are also shifted.42 When H+ (or OH–) is directly
involved in the oxidization/reduction reaction, as in eq 3, the relative potentials between
O2/H2O and 1L-WSe2 will change,42 becoming one of the factors influencing the
pH-dependent degradation effect.

Furthermore, WO3 will be involved in a more complicated
pH-dependent reaction in aqueous solution because of its thermodynamic
instability.54,55 To further understand the pH
dependence, we also consider the second reaction of the oxidation
product 4  

whose reaction rate also strongly depends on the solution pH. According
to eqs 3 and 4, the pH dependence of the photodegradation rate
can be understood as follows: under the basic condition, the reaction
resulting in the dissolution of WO3 should become faster
than that under the acidic condition. Thus, the fast degradation under
the basic condition is attributable to both the enhanced oxidation
reaction and the dissolution reaction of WSe2 and WO3, which generate more defects and edges56−59 in the 1L-WSe2 flake.
This hypothesis is supported by the pH dependence of the decrease
of the PL intensities (Figure 3). For the PL intensity under the acidic condition, the time
trace is well fitted by a single-exponential function. By contrast,
the trace corresponding to the basic condition shows a much faster
initial degradation that cannot be explained by a single reaction,
implying involvement of an additional electrochemical process with
a different time scale, as expressed in eq 4. WSe2 degradation species differ
among the acidic (WO3 and SeO42–), neutral, and basic conditions (WO42– and SeO42–).60 This observation is consistent with the recently reported pH-dependent
Gibbs free energy of WSe2.60 For samples under acidic conditions, we can simply set the degradation
rate equation as dA/dt = −αA, where A is the undegraded area of 1L-WSe2 at time t and α is the rate constant.
Solving this equation gives A = A0 e–αt, where A0 is the original area of 1L-WSe2. The undegraded area of 1L-WSe2 decreases exponentially,
and the decrease in PL intensity can be well reproduced using a single-exponential
function, as shown in Figure 3.

To further confirm the photoinduced degradation effects,
we measured
the PL properties of the samples kept in the dark and in degassed
water. The samples kept under dark conditions were not illuminated
except during the measurements. As shown in Figure 5, the degradation reactions of 1L-WSe2 in both dark (not degassed) (∼46%) and degassed (with
light) conditions (∼38%) for 30 min are much slower than that
of 1L-WSe2 in distilled water (not degassed, with light)
(∼82%), which supports our hypothesis that the degradation
is mainly induced by the electrochemical effects of the photogenerated
holes and dissolved oxygen in water.61,62

PL intensity of 1L-WSe2 in distilled
water, water in the absence of light (dark) and degassed water. The
solid curves are the results of fitting using single-exponential functions.

The effect of photogenerated carrier
density on the degradation
rate was also confirmed. As shown in Figure 6, the degradation rates of 1L-WSe2 under all conditions (acidic, neutral, and basic) are nearly proportional
to the density of photogenerated electrons/holes, which strongly supports
the hypothesis that degradation occurs mainly from photoinduced effects.
The wavelength-dependent degradation rate, as shown in Figure S4, further supports this hypothesis.
Moreover, under the acidic condition, the degradation rate was almost
one order of magnitude smaller than that under the basic condition,
which also supports the aforementioned hypothesis. By extrapolation,
the degradation rate is between 0.1 × 10–3 and
0.3 × 10–3 s–1 when the photocarrier
density is 0 (Figure 6), consistent with the degradation rate in the dark (Figure 5), where a slow degradation
with a rate of ∼0.3 × 10–3 s–1 is observed.

Conclusions
In summary, we studied
the stability of 1L-WSe2 and
1L-MoS2 in ambient air, distilled water, and acidic/basic
aqueous solutions under light irradiation. In contrast to the good
stability of both materials in ambient air, 1L-MoS2 was
found to be much more stable than 1L-WSe2 under aqueous
conditions. These results were consistently attributed to electrochemical
reactions involving photoinduced electrons/holes at the interface
of 1L-WSe2 and the O2/H2O redox system.
A much lower degradation rate was observed for 1L-WSe2 under
acidic conditions than under basic conditions, which we attributed
mainly to the pH dependence of the oxidation/reduction potential of
WSe2 and to the further reaction of the oxidation species.
We also confirmed that the degradation rates of 1L-WSe2 in both degassed water and dark conditions are much lower than those
of 1L-WSe2 in distilled water. The slower degradation in
degassed water and dark conditions supports our hypothesis that photoinduced
electrons/holes and dissolved oxygen are the main contributors to
the degradation of 1L-WSe2. Our results may provide insights
into the effects of photogenerated electrons/holes and electrochemical
phenomena at the interface of atomically thin semiconductors and an
O2/H2O redox system on their stability, which
is important for their applications in realistic environments because
these effects are unavoidable when a monolayer material with a large
specific surface area is in a practical environment with finite humidity
or in solution.

Experimental Methods
1L-TMDC samples
were prepared from a bulk single crystal (hq graphene)
using a standard mechanical exfoliation method. The thickness of an
exfoliated TMDC was first determined via image contrast using an optical
microscope, and the Raman and PL spectra were then used to confirm
the thickness. The exfoliated 1L-TMDCs were transferred onto a transparent
glass substrate using polydimethylsiloxane, and the substrate with
1L-TMDCs was then tightly bound with a glass tube to compose a liquid
reservoir in which sufficient liquid could be kept over the sample
for the optical measurements in aqueous solutions. H2SO4 and NaOH were used as the pH adjustors to attain acidic,
neutral, or basic aqueous solutions. Degassed water was prepared using
argon gas bubbling to reduce the dissolved oxygen concentration.

Optical measurements were performed through the transparent glass
substrate using a homemade optical measurement system with a supercontinuum
light source (20 ps pulse duration and 40 MHz frequency) equipped
with a monochromator (Figure 1). PL spectra were recorded with the samples in ambient air,
in water, and finally in acidic and basic aqueous solutions using
a liquid nitrogen-cooled silicon CCD detector. The measurements were
performed at regular intervals (5 min) with a signal acquisition time
of 5 s. During the measurements, samples were kept illuminated by
light with a power density of 800 W cm–2, which
is in the linear region as shown in Figure S2, except for the experiment under dark conditions. The amount of
water and aqueous solutions was kept the same, and all the measurements
were performed at room temperature.
