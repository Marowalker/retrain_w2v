Citrus juices from
whole oranges and grapefruits (discarded from
open market) and aqueous extracts from citrus processing waste (mainly
peels) were used for bacterial cellulose production by Komagataeibacter sucrofermentans DSM 15973. Grapefruit
and orange juices yielded higher bacterial cellulose concentration
(6.7 and 6.1 g/L, respectively) than lemon, grapefruit, and orange
peels aqueous extracts (5.2, 5.0, and 2.9 g/L, respectively). Compared
to the cellulosic fraction isolated from depectinated orange peel,
bacterial cellulose produced from orange peel aqueous extract presented
improved water-holding capacity (26.5 g water/g, 3-fold higher), degree
of polymerization (up to 6-fold higher), and crystallinity index (35–86%
depending on the method used). The presence of absorption bands at
3240 and 3270 cm–1 in the IR spectrum of bacterial
cellulose indicated that the bacterial strain K. sucrofermentans synthesizes both Iα and Iβ cellulose
types, whereas the signals in the 13C NMR spectrum demonstrated
that Iα cellulose is the dominant type.

Introduction
Escalating
negative environmental and societal concerns associated
with utilizing traditional petrochemical processes for chemical, polymer,
and material production have paved the way toward a bioeconomy era
using renewable resources instead. Citrus wastes and residues represent
an interesting renewable feedstock because of its wide availability
and propensity to yield chemicals and materials. In 2016/2017, the
worldwide citrus production, including oranges, grapefruits, and lemons,
was 63.3 million tonnes, with oranges dominating market share at 80%.1 Citrus peels constitute almost one half of the
total fruit mass and are generated as low-value byproduct streams
from the corresponding processing industries. Furthermore, fruits
are discarded by open markets, but information on the quantities generated
is scarce. Adding value to citrus processing residues and, especially,
whole fruits discarded from open markets requires the development
of novel biorefinery models. For instance, orange peels are being
used in the development of integrated biorefineries for the production
of d-limonene, pectin, and mesoporous cellulose2,3 or fermentation products (due to its high carbohydrate content,
potentially more than 80% of peel weight)4 such as bacterial cellulose (BC),5 biosurfactants,6 citric acid,7 and
bioethanol.8

The utilization of agroindustrial
waste and byproduct streams as
feedstock is necessary to achieve sustainable production of bacterial
cellulose. For instance, crude glycerol from biodiesel production
processes and flour-rich confectionery industry waste streams have
been used to produce bacterial cellulose (ca. 13 g/L) under static
cultures.9 Kuo et al.10 used orange peel waste as substrate for bacterial cellulose
production and showed outstanding performance, where yields were up
to 6 times higher than conventional medium (Hestrin and Schramm).11 The wide availability, low price, renewability,
and high carbohydrate content of citrus waste makes it a good candidate
as a bacterial cellulose production medium.

Bacterial (nano)cellulose
is produced extracellularly at high efficiency
and purity by Acetobacter species.12 Bacterial cellulose is classified as a material of nanoscale
network, as it is secreted in the form of ribbon-shaped fibrils of
less than 100 nm comprising 2–4 nm nanofibrils.13 Nanocellulose fibers can be applied in various
industrial sectors including food industry, pharmaceutical, and electronics
due to their exceptional properties, e.g., enhanced mechanical strength,
high water holding capacity, and biodegradability.14

Various chemical, mechanical, microwave-assisted,
and enzymatic
methods or combinations of those have been proposed for the conversion
of plant cellulose to nanostructured cellulose.15 High production costs and not so environment-friendly processes
continue to hamper the fast track development and acceptance of nanocellulose.16

However, bacterial cellulose can be produced
under static or agitated
cultures. Static cultures are simple and lead to the formation of
cellulose membranes at the surface of the culture, but industrial
implementation is hindered due to high production costs resulting
from low productivities achieved. Agitated cultures could lead to
cost-competitive production of bacterial cellulose,17 but there remains a need to optimize operating conditions.

This study evaluates the synthesis and characterization of bacterial
cellulose using aqueous extracts from solid citrus processing waste
or whole fruits discarded as waste from open markets. Furthermore,
the key physicochemical properties of bacterial cellulose produced
on orange peel aqueous extracts were identified and compared with
the respective properties of cellulose isolated from orange peels.

Results
and Discussion
Production of Bacterial Cellulose Utilizing
Citrus-Based Media
Citrus juices (orange and grapefruit)
from whole fruits discarded
from open markets and aqueous extracts from solid citrus waste (SCW)
(orange, grapefruit, and lemon) were evaluated for their efficiency
for bacterial cellulose production by the bacterial strain Komagataeibacter sucrofermentans DSM 15973. Figure 1 presents the total
sugar consumption and bacterial cellulose production in shake flask
fermentations of K. sucrofermentans cultivated on orange and grapefruit juices and aqueous extracts
from orange, grapefruit, and lemon SCW peels. The cultivation of K. sucrofermentans in grapefruit juice-based media
led to the highest bacterial cellulose concentration (6.7 g/L), yield
(0.36 g bacterial cellulose per g consumed sugars), and productivity
(0.61 g/L/day) after 11 days. The bacterial cellulose production achieved
via bacterial cultures in grapefruit peel extracts (5.0 g/L), orange
juice (6.1 g/L), and lemon peel extracts (5.2 g/L) is also promising.
The lowest bacterial cellulose concentration (2.9 g/L) was produced
after 13 days when orange peel extracts were used. The consumed sugar
to bacterial cellulose conversion yield achieved was higher than 0.17
g/g, whereas productivity was higher than 0.25 g/L/day. At 11 days
for all fermentations, the initial sucrose and glucose present in
the media used were assimilated at 81.7–100 and 65.7–100%,
respectively, whereas the assimilation of fructose varied within the
range of 68.3–90.8%. The consumption of total sugars was in
the range of 76.5–96.2% at 11 days for all cultures used.

(c), grapefruit peel extracts (d), and lemon peel extracts (e).

Several studies have investigated
bacterial cellulose production
using various agroindustrial resources leading up to 10.8 g/L of bacterial
cellulose concentration.21−26 Moon et al.27 reported the production
of 18 g/L BC concentration by the strain Acetobacter
xylinum KJ1 cultivated on saccharified food wastes
in a 30 L bioreactor. There are few reported studies on the utilization
of fruit-based fermentation media for BC production. Kurosumi et al.5 evaluated juices from oranges, pineapples, apples,
Japanese pears, and grapes as fermentation feedstocks for bacterial
cellulose production, with orange juice demonstrating the highest
bacterial cellulose concentration (5.9 g/L) after 14 days of incubation.
Castro et al.28 reported the ability of Gluconacetobacter swingsii sp. to grow and produce
bacterial cellulose on pineapple peel juice (2.8 g/L) and sugar cane
juice. Adebayo-Tayo et al.29 reported the
utilization of pawpaw juice for the production of 7.7 g/L of BC concentration.
The BC production (up to 6.7 g/L) achieved in this study are among
the highest reported on fruit-based media.

Morphology of Cellulose
Samples
Figure 2 shows selected scanning electron microscopy
(SEM) micrographs of the different cellulose samples. Whereas bacterial
cellulose (Figure 2a) is formed by long fibrous network of cellulose microfibrils (D = 50–100 nm, L = several micrometers),
conventional pectin extraction (CAE)-CB (Figure 2b) and OPEC-CB (Figure 2c) give a more compacted structure, where
the amorphous matrix covers/binds the cellulose microfibrils matrix.
Hence, in these samples, the cellulose microfibrils are not as visible
as in bacterial cellulose.

Figure 2 SEM of bacterial cellulose (a), CAE-CB (b),
and OPEC-CB (c) samples.

Infrared Spectroscopy
The attenuated total reflection
infrared (ATR-IR) spectrum of CAE-CB, OPEC-CB, bacterial cellulose,
and microcrystalline cellulose (MCC) are presented in Figure 3. Besides cellulose, the CAE-CB
and OPEC-CB samples also contain residual pectin, hemicellulose (mainly
evidenced by uronyl residues bands at ca. 1710–1740, 1610–1630,
1430–1455, and 1250 cm–1), and small amounts
of lignin, phenolics, and possibly traces of proteins (mainly due
to aromatic and amide characteristic absorptions at ca. 1600–1650,
1550–1450, and 1260–1180 cm–1).30−32 Due to the absence of pectin and hemicellulose, bacterial cellulose
and MCC present similar absorption bands.

Figure 3 Infrared spectra of MCC
(red), bacterial cellulose (blue), CAE-CB
(purple), and OPEC-CB (green).

The main IR absorption bands appearing in all samples are
summarized
in Table 1. The two
bands that appear approximately at 1540 and 1640 cm–1 in the spectrum of bacterial cellulose correspond to amide bond
and can be associated with remaining proteins from the culture medium
or residual bacterial biomass that was not completely separated during
washing of bacterial cellulose membranes. According to Sugiyama et
al.,33 absorption bands of cellulose samples
around 750 and 3240 cm–1 show the existence of type
Iα crystalline cellulose, whereas absorption bands
around 710 and 3270 cm–1 show the existence of the
amorphous type Iβ. In the IR spectra of bacterial
cellulose samples, the presence of 3240 and 3270 cm–1 bands that are characteristic of cellulose Iα and
Iβ, respectively, shows that bacterial cultures produce
both polymorphs during fermentation.

Thermogravimetric Analysis
(TGA)
According to the TGA
data shown as derivative thermogravimetric traces in Figure 4 and Table 2, all samples presented a maximum degradation
temperature around 315–340 °C corresponding to the decomposition
of cellulose, which shows considerable thermostability.30,31 Moreover, the derivative thermogravimetric (dTG) traces of CAE-CB
and OPEC-CB show three decomposition intervals, corresponding to the
elimination of water under 180 °C, breakdown of pectin and hemicellulose
at the range of 220–260 °C and decomposition of cellulose
at 310–380 °C.30,31 The differences in
the decomposition trace of CAE-CB and OPEC-CB samples lie on the fact
that the CAE-CB contains, relatively, more pectin than OPEC-CB (Table 2). As expected, MCC
and bacterial cellulose, as pure cellulose materials, do not present
decomposition bands characteristic of pectin and hemicellulose.

Powder X-ray
Diffraction (XRD) Analysis
Figure 5 shows the XRD diffractograms
of MCC, CAE-CB, OPEC-CB, and bacterial cellulose. The diffraction
peaks at 2θ = 14.5, 16.6, and 22.6° correspond to cellulose
structure. These peaks are attributed to the (1 0 0), (0 1 0), and
(1 1 0) planes of cellulose Iα or the (1 1 0), (1
1 0), and (2 0 0) planes of cellulose Iβ.32 It is not trivial to distinguish the two allomorphs
based exclusively on the XRD peak positions due to their small distance.34 Bacterial cellulose and MCC present more defined
crystalline cellulose peaks than CAE-CB and OPEC-CB. This occurs probably
due to the higher amorphous content on those latter samples, evidenced
by the larger amorphous contribution band with maximum ca. 18°.

diffraction patterns of MCC (blue), CAE-CB (red), OPEC-CB
(green), and bacterial cellulose, BC (purple).

13C Solid-State NMR
According to the 13C cross-polarization magic angle spinning (CPMAS) NMR spectrum
(Figure 6), the signals
that correspond to the six carbons of cellulose molecule were identified
in all samples. C1 corresponds to the signal at 105 ppm,
C4 at 89.1 ppm, C3 at 75.12 ppm, C2 and C5 at 72.6 ppm, and C6 at 65.4 ppm. In
the spectrum of bacterial cellulose, the enhanced downfield resonance
line for C4 triplet and the strong central resonance line
for C1 crystalline indicate that cellulose Iα is dominant.35 CAE-CB and OPEC-CB samples
presented extra signals because of the presence of other components.
Signals at 174 and 53.9 ppm in CAE-CB and OPEC-CB correspond to carbonyl
and methyl-ester group of pectin, respectively.15

OPEC-CB (purple), and bacterial cellulose, BC (red).

Crystallinity Index
Crystallinity
index depends significantly
on the instrument used and the data analysis method applied. According
to Park et al.,36 the ATR-IR spectroscopy
is the most convenient method (resulting in a ratio of crystalline
to amorphous content), whereas XRD and NMR methods provide more accurate
values of crystallinity index resulting in percentage values. Bacterial
cellulose demonstrated the highest crystallinity index in all the
examined methods followed by MCC, OPEC-CB, and CAE-CB (Table 3). As observed in Figure 3, the IR bands related to the
crystallinity index of cellulose present in CAE-CB and OPEC-CB overlap
with absorptions from other compounds bounded with cellulose, such
as pectin and hemicellulose. Hence, the presence of these amorphous
polysaccharides can underestimate the crystallinity index calculated
from the IR data. Moreover, according to Liitiä et al.37 and Bernardinelli et al.,38 hemicellulose, lignin, and disordered cellulose in plant
biomass resonate in the amorphous NMR spectral region and interfere
with cellulose crystallinity. The XRD diffractions will also contain
contributions from amorphous matter in the samples. Consequently,
the determination of the crystallinity index by those techniques are
restricted to result only in relative values of crystallinity index
(standards would be required). However, values of crystallinity index
calculated from NMR, IR, and XRD were consistent in relation to each
other, and XRD, in particular, seems to have given the most realistic
crystallinity index values.

of MCC, CAE-CB,
OPEC-CB, and Bacterial Cellulose Identified by XRD, IR, and 13C Solid NMR
 	crystallinity

sample	XRD (%)	IR (ratio Cr/Am)a	NMR (%)

CAE-CB	53.3 ± 3.01	1.3 ± 0.01	16.1 ± 1.29	
OPEC-CB	56.4 ± 4.89	1.5 ± 0.01	22.2 ± 1.06	
bacterial cellulose	86.9 ± 2.23	9.7 ± 0.51	69 ± 4.02	
a Ratio of crystalline
to amorphous
content.

OPEC-CB crystallinity
index values are higher than those of CAE-CB
due to the lower content of pectin (“amorphous matter”)
in the former (see Table 2), which reflects the higher depectination power of the microwave
acid-free treatment vs conventional acid treatment.

Degree of Polymerization
Table 4 presents
the degree of polymerization of
MCC, CAE-CB, OPEC-CB, and bacterial cellulose. Bacterial cellulose
had the highest degree of polymerization (1620), whereas MCC showed
the lowest value (134). The degree of polymerization of CAE-CB seems
to be almost 6-fold higher than that of OPEC-CB, which expresses the
high efficiency of the microwave treatment regarding pectin extraction
and biomass deconstruction. However, it is important to consider the
limitation of this analysis to those samples, once they comprise other
biomolecules besides cellulose, which can interfere with the analysis
accuracy.

OPEC-CB, and Bacterial Cellulose

CAE-CB	1250 ± 0.69	
OPEC-CB	269 ± 16.35

cellulose	1620 ± 1.35	
Water-Holding
Capacity (WHC)
The WHC is considered
one of the most important physical properties of bacterial cellulose
membranes, especially for biomedical applications. The WHC of bacterial
cellulose is remarkably higher (26.5 g/g) than that of CAE-CB (7.6
g/g) and OPEC-CB (7.9 g/g) samples. This is attributed to its nanofibril
network (see Figure 2) that allows more water to be bound. The WHC of bacterial cellulose
produced in this study is in good agreement with literature-cited
publications, with similar35 or even higher39 values. Considering CAE-CB and OPEC-CB samples,
their WHC is comparable to banana dietary fibers (6.7–10.5
g/g).40

Conclusions
This
study showed that citrus juices derived from whole fruits
discarded as waste from open markets and aqueous extracts from citrus
peels produced as low-value waste streams from citrus-processing industries
could be efficiently used for bacterial cellulose production. The
properties of bacterial cellulose produced from citrus-based fermentations
demonstrate superior properties to cellulose isolated from orange
peels. However, as presented by de Melo et al.,15 it is possible to further process those cellulosic residues
by means of microwave hydrothermal treatment to yield nanocellulose,
which is a material with similar properties to bacterial cellulose
and presents superior hydration properties in relation to its precursors.

Experimental
Section
Raw Materials
Citrus fruits (oranges and grapefruits)
were obtained ex gratia from a local open market
in Athens, Greece, as discarded (waste) fruits. Solid citrus wastes
(SCW, peel, and pulp residue after juice processing) of orange, grapefruit,
and lemon were obtained from local shops.

Microorganisms
The bacterial strain K. sucrofermentans DSM 15973 was used as cellulose
producer. Preculture media were prepared as proposed by Hestrin and
Schramm.11 Bacterial cultures were stored
at 4 °C in 2% (w/w) agar Petri dishes supplemented with 1% (w/w)
glucose, yeast extract, and peptone.

Depectination of Orange
Peel
Conventional Acidic Extraction of Pectin
Orange peels
(<5 mm, 80 g) were added to 250 mL deionized water adjusting the
pH to 1.5 with 0.5 M HCl. The mixture was heated at 90 °C for
1 h. The liquid phase containing pectin was separated from the remaining
solid residue by vacuum filtration. The remaining solid residue mainly
consisting of cellulosic matter (CAE-CB) was dried at 30 °C for
24 h and weighed. Figure 7 summarizes the procedure.

Figure 7 Conventional acidic extraction of pectin
under reflux at 90 °C.

Acid-Free Microwave-Assisted Extraction of Pectin
Orange
peels (<5 mm, 150 g) were added in a 2 L Pyrex vessel. The microwave
reactor was operated at 1200 W for 6 min and subsequently at 800 W
for 19 min. At the end of the process, the remaining solid residue
was about 34% of the initial. The d-limonene-free solid residue
(LFSR) was subsequently submitted to pectin extraction using a microwave
reactor (CEM MARS 6, One Touch Technology) and closed containers (EasyPrep
Plus EasyPrep Teflon) of 100 mL. In each run, six containers were
filled with 4 g of LFSR sample and 70 mL of deionized water. The equipment
was operated under high agitation at 120 °C for 15 min at max.
power of 1800 W. The resulting mixture was vacuum filtered. The filtrate
(cellulosic matter, OPEC-CB) was dried at 30 °C for 24 h and
weighed. The process is summarized in Figure 8.

extraction.

Formation of Nutrient-Rich
Solid Citrus Waste Extracts for Bacterial
Fermentations
After juice extraction, SCW were collected
and mixed with water in a liquid-to-solid ratio of 3:1 and boiled
for 1 h. The liquid phase was separated from the solid residues with
filter paper and the sugar and free amino nitrogen (FAN) concentrations
were determined (Table 5). The SCW extracts were stored at −20 °C until further
use.

Bacterial Cellulose Production
Bacterial fermentations
with K. sucrofermentans were conducted
in 250 mL Erlenmeyer flasks and 50 mL working volume at 30 °C.
All the flasks were inoculated with 10% (v/v) preculture media and
the pH value of the broth was adjusted to 6 using 5 M aqueous NaOH.
The flasks were initially incubated at 150 rpm for 1–2 days
and then statically. The total duration of the experiments was 13
days. Before fermentation, the nutrient composition of aqueous extracts
from SCW and juices derived from whole citrus fruits discarded from
open markets were properly adjusted according to Hestrin and Schramm
fermentation media.11 All media were filter-sterilized
using a 0.22 μm filter unit (Polycap AS, Whatman Ltd., Buckinghamshire,
U.K.). The initial FAN and total sugar concentration in all cases
were 249 ± 25 mg/L and 19.5 ± 0.7 g/L, respectively. All
citrus juices were applied as the sole carbon sources for bacterial
cellulose production. However, in the case of SCW aqueous extracts,
their initial total sugar concentration was lower than that of citrus
juices. Thus, to reach the desirable total sugar concentration, the
SCW aqueous extracts were supplemented with commercial sugars using
the same sugar ratio of each individual extract. Sugar supplementation
was carried out in this study to evaluate the potential for bacterial
cellulose production. Process development should resort to concentration
of SCW aqueous extracts via reverse osmosis. Five sets of experiments
were carried out using citrus juices (orange, grapefruit) and SCW
extracts (orange, lemon, and grapefruit) as fermentative media. K. sucrofermentans could not grow on lemon juice
media probably due to its high acidity and the high amount of NaOH
required for adjusting the initial pH of this medium to 6. Sampling
was carried out in predetermined intervals to monitor sugar and FAN
consumption along with bacterial cellulose production.

Characterization
of CAE-CB, OPEC-CB, and Bacterial Cellulose
The properties
of isolated CAE-CB and OPEC-CB, obtained from depectination
of orange peels, and bacterial celluloses, produced from orange citrus
waste extracts, were analyzed with respect to purity (infrared spectroscopy),
decomposition temperature (thermogravimetric analysis), crystallinity
index (infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffractometry, NMR), degree of
crystallinity (13C solid-state NMR), degree of polymerization,
and water-holding capacity (WHC). Sample morphology characterization
was performed via scanning electron microscopy (SEM).

Infrared
Spectroscopy
Attenuated total reflectance
infrared spectroscopy (ATR-IR) measurements were performed on a Bruker
Vertex 70 instrument. Commercial microcrystalline cellulose (MCC)
was used as the reference material. Spectra were recorded from 3600
to 600 cm–1 at 16 scans, 32 scans background scan
time with a spectral resolution of 4 cm–1.

Thermogravimetric
Analysis
Thermogravimetric analysis
(TGA) was performed using NETZSCH STA 409. Fifty milligram of sample
was precisely weighed into a TGA cup and heated under nitrogen flow
of 50 mL/min to avoid sample oxidation. The temperature increased
from room temperature up to 700 °C at 10 K/min rate.

13C Solid-State NMR
13C{1H} CPMAS
spectra were acquired using a 400 MHz Bruker Avance III HD spectrometer
equipped with a Bruker 4 mm H(F)/X/Y triple-resonance probe and 9.4T
Ascend superconducting magnet. The CP experiments employed a 1 ms
linearly ramped contact pulse, spinning rates of 12 000 ±
2 Hz, recycle delays of 5 s, spinal-64 heteronuclear decoupling (at
νrf = 85 kHz), and a sum of 512 co-added transients.
Chemical shifts are reported with respect to tetramethylsilane and
referenced using adamantane (29.5 ppm) as an external secondary reference.

X-ray Diffractometry
X-ray diffractometry (XRD) patterns
of the samples were recorded using a Bruker D8 powder diffractometer
equipped with a Cu source and PSD Lynxeye detector. The samples were
ground to a powder before analysis or lyophilized when referring to
bacterial cellulose. The samples were scanned over a 2θ range
between 5 and 90° and a θ range between 2.5 and 45°
for 8.38 min, with each step recorded at 0.1 s interval. Generator
voltage and filament emission were set to 40 kV and 40 mA, respectively.
Data were processed using an EVA software.

Degree of Polymerization
Lyophilized samples (0.25
g) were dissolved in 50 mL copper(II) ethylenediamine solution (0.5
M). The relative viscosity (ηr) and specific viscosity
(ηsp) of each sample in copper–ethylenediamine
solution were measured using a Cannon-Fenske Routine Viscometer immersed
in a water bath at constant temperature (25 ± 0.5 °C) and
then calculated according to eqs 1–3 1   2   3  where t0 is the
flow time of the solvent, t is the flow time of the
solution, η is the intrinsic viscosity, and c is 0.5 g/dL.

The average molecular weight (M) was determined by the Mark–Houwink empirical equation (eq 4) 4  where α is equal to 0.905 and K is equal to 1.33 × 10–4 dL/g.

For the particular polymer–solvent system, the Mark–Houwink
parameters, α and K.18 The degree of polymerization (eq 5) was calculated as M of the polymer
divided by the molecular weight of an anhydroglucose monomeric unit: 5  

Crystallinity Index
This study implemented three different
methods for crystallinity index determination, namely, infrared spectroscopy, 13C solid-state NMR, and XRD. The method used in the present
study was the peak-height method described by Segal et al.19 The IR crystallinity index of cellulose was
evaluated as the intensity ratio between IR absorption bands at 1427
and 895 cm–1, which are assigned to CH2 bending mode and deformation of anomeric CH, respectively. The calculation
of the XRD crystallinity index of cellulose was calculated using the
peak intensity method (eq 6) 6  where CrI is the crystallinity index, I002 is the maximum intensity of the lattice
diffraction, and IAM is the intensity
diffraction at 2θ (∼23°).

Solid-state 13C NMR crystallinity index was determined by separating the
C4 region of cellulose spectrum into crystalline and amorphous
peaks and calculated by dividing the area of the crystalline peak
(87–93 ppm) by the total area assigned to the C4 peak (80–93 ppm) (%).

Water-Holding Capacity
Dry sample of 0.25 g was mixed
with 25 mL of distilled water and left for 1 h at room temperature.
After centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 20 min, the pellet was weighed
and the WHC was calculated as g of water absorbed per g of dry sample.

Scanning Electron Microscopy
The surface and morphology
of the samples were evaluated by SEM (Jeol JSM-6360). The lyophilized
samples were coated with gold and examined at an accelerated voltage
of 20 kV and magnification of 20 000×.

High-Performance
Liquid Chromatography
The concentration
of sugars was determined by high-performance liquid chromatography
(Prominence, Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) equipped with an Aminex HPX-87H
(BioRad, Hercules, CA) column, coupled to a differential refractometer
(RID-10A, Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan). The mobile phase was a 10 mM H2SO4 aqueous solution with 0.6 mL/min flow rate.
FAN concentration was assayed by the ninhydrin colorimetric method.20

Wet bacterial cellulose membranes were
removed from the fermentation broth and rinsed with water. The resultant
membranes were immersed in 1 M aqueous NaOH, boiled for 30 min, and
finally washed repeatedly until a neutral pH was obtained. The dry
weight of bacterial cellulose was determined either by drying the
produced bacterial cellulose at 35 °C for 48 h and subsequently
cooled in a desiccator or by lyophilizing the samples.

All analyses
were performed in triplicate and the presented values
correspond to average values.
