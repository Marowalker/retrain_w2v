Model β-turn
inducers were prepared from constrained oxazanorbornene
aminols. Taking advantage of the starting materials geometry, new
diastereoisomeric compounds were synthesized, introducing different
amino acidic residues. The products were spectroscopically characterized
(VT and NMR titration). Temperature coefficients in dimethyl sulfoxide
denote the existence of an intramolecular hydrogen bond. Chiroptical
properties disclosed a β-turn arrangement of the synthesized
compounds. The fused isoxazoline ring constraints the cyclopentane
moiety, stabilizing a boatlike conformation that ensures the turn
efficiency but limiting the accessibility to hindered amino acids.

Introduction
Turns are pivotal motifs
that reverse the direction of peptide
strands and helices.1 Turns are crucial
for protein structure and occur within protein-binding sites, at protein–protein
interfaces and in bioactive peptides, playing a central role in recognition.2 The growing interest in these structures pushes
many research groups to intensify the efforts in this area3 by designing and developing novel structures
for specific applications4 and using classical
scaffolds for promising new synthetic targets.5

β-Turn motifs are the most common ones observed in small
peptides and proteins,6 and their synthesis
takes advantage of conformationally constrained molecules, to get
information about the three-dimensional interplay between ligand and
receptor. The key point is the correspondence among conformations
in solution, their real physical meaning and conformations determined
in silico.7 For these reasons, three-dimensional
interactions are essential for the design of analogues in the drug
discovery process. Spatial orientation determination deeply involves
the conformational analysis on the basis of spectroscopic techniques
and molecular modeling.6 Most β-turns
contain intramolecular hydrogen bonds between the carbonyl oxygen
of the first residue (i) and the amide NH proton
of the fourth residue (i + 3), forming a pseudo-10-membered
ring,1,8 and must respect the critical distances
between the Cα carbon atoms (dcrit < 7 Å) and the one between the carbonyl oxygen of the first
amino acid and the amide hydrogen of the fourth one (<4 Å)
(Figure 1). In general,
the use of cage amino acids9−11 or conformationally constrained
β-amino acids12 permits the induction
of a β-turn by the complete replacement of the three amino acids,
normally required.

Figure 1 Criteria for the identification of β-turns.

Recently, we have presented our
approach toward the preliminary
design of original nonpeptidic turn inducers13 based on a new class of cyclopenta[d]isoxazoline
aminols using the nitrosocarbonyl (RCONO, 3) chemistry
(Scheme 1).14

Scheme 1 Synthetic Pathway of Cyclopenta[d]isoxazoline Aminols
through Nitrosocarbonyl Intermediates Chemistry
These fleeting intermediates, generated by the
mild oxidation of
nitrile oxides 1 with tertiary amine N-oxides or by periodate oxidation of hydroxamic acids 2, are efficiently trapped by cyclopentadiene (or other dienes), affording
the hetero-Diels–Alder (HDA) cycloadducts 4, synthetically
elaborated to give the conformationally restricted carbocyclic aminols 6 through amide hydrolysis and N–O bond cleavage of
the cycloadducts 5.9,15

In our “proof-of-concept”
work,13 we promised to develop further
experiments to verify the
influence of the two side chain features on the type of turn, gaining
a better understanding of the applicability/reliability/robustness
of these scaffolds as β-turn inducers. We wish to present here
the elongation studies from the hydroxy and amino groups with side
chains incorporating amino acidic residues (alanine, glycine, and
valine) and the characterizations of the corresponding diastereoisomeric
turn structures through NMR and circular dichroism (CD) techniques.

Results
and Discussion
The regioisomeric aminols 6a,6b were
prepared according to the previously reported methodology,14,15 using benzonitrile oxide as the 1,3-dipole in the cycloaddition
step. The hydroxy group protection was performed under standard procedure
affording the amines 7a,7b (85%). Compounds 7a,7b were coupled with the commercially available N-Boc-l-Alanine. Diastereoisomers 8a and 9a were isolated in good yields, and similarly,
diastereoisomers 8b and 9b, respectively,
were obtained from 7a and 7b. The hydroxy
functionalities deprotection was secured by standard n-Bu4NF treatment, and the alcohols of type 10a,10b/11a,11b were obtained
in very good yields (Scheme 2). All of the compounds reported above were separated and
found identical to authentic specimens previously synthesized.13

(see Supporting Information (SI) for details).

Afterward, the alcoholic groups of compounds 10 and 11 were derivatized with two different N-Boc-protected
amino acids: glycine and l-valine. Glycine was chosen to
avoid, in a first advancement step, the presence of a further stereogenic
center that was subsequently introduced with the l-valine
residue. The esterifications were conducted with a typical DIC/DMAP
coupling procedure in DCM at room temperature for 48 h. The ester
derivatives 12/13 for glycine and 14/15 for the l-valine were obtained
in very good yields. A full characterization of these final compounds,
along with the detailed experimental procedures, is reported in the Supporting Information.

The conformational
analysis of both the series of compounds16 relies on CD analyses coupled with NMR experiments.17,18 The CD spectra were collected from MeOH 10–4 M
solutions of diastereoisomers 12/13 and 14/15 within a wavelength range of 200–300
nm (Figure 2). In the
case of glycine derivatives, compound 12a CD profile
has a positive absorption band at 213.9 nm and a second negative band
centered at 227.3 nm, indicating a left β-turn in accordance
with the data reported in the literature.19 On the other side, the CD spectrum of 13a shows a comparable
and specular trend with a negative absorption band at 215.1 nm and
a second positive band centered at 227.1 nm, consistent for a right
β-turn.

Figure 2 Experimental CD spectra of diastereoisomers 12/13 (top) and 14/15 (bottom).

In a similar way, compound 12b CD profile has a negative
absorption band at 213.6 nm and a second positive band centered at
228.9 nm. This profile can be referred to a right β-turn.16

The CD spectrum of 13b shows
a positive absorption
band at 214.7 nm and a second negative band centered at 227.8 nm,
consistent for a left β-turn. Noteworthy, these values are remarkably
close to those observed for the model malonic derivatives.13 Regarding the l-valine derivatives,
the CD profile of compound 14a, a left β-turn,
has a positive absorption band at 213.5 nm and a second negative band
centered at 227.1 nm.19 On the other side,
the CD spectrum of 15a shows a comparable and specular
trend with a negative absorption band at 211.3 nm and a second positive
band centered at 225.9 nm, consistent for a right β-turn. Compound 14b CD profile has a negative absorption band at 215.4 nm
and a second positive band centered at 226.3 nm. This profile can
be addressed to a right β-turn.16 Finally, the CD spectrum of 15b shows a positive absorption
band at 214.7 nm and a second negative band centered at 227.8 nm,
consistent for a left β-turn. These values are again strictly
close to those observed for the glycine derivatives and the model
malonic ones.13

Previously reported
simulations of the CD absorption profiles of
the model malonic derivatives13 done by
time-dependent density functional theory (DFT) calculations20 at the B3LYP/6-31g(d,p) level in methanolic
solution nicely fitted with the experimental profiles, indicating
that the configuration inversions at the isoxazoline–norbornane
moieties correspond to an inversion of the chiroptical properties
of the products in hand. This fitting allowed assigning the product
configurations beyond any reasonable doubt. These assignments are
the same for all of the newly synthesized diastereoisomers because
of the nice overlapping of CD spectra.13

H-bonding in diastereoisomers 12–15 in
CDCl3 and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) was evaluated through
temperature
coefficients (tc) of the amide and NHBoc protons
of the amino acidic residues at 298.15 and 318.15 K for CDCl3 and up to 348.15 K for DMSO as well as DMSO titration experiments.19 Typically, lower tc values
in CDCl3 ≤ 2.4 ppb/K are related not only to shielded
protons but also to accessible ones, and only values significantly
larger than 2.4 ppb/K in CDCl3 can be unambiguously assigned
to NH protons initially shielded, which become exposed to the solvent
upon increasing temperature.2,21 Conversely, low tc in DMSO (<5 ppb/K) are related to inaccessible protons
to the solvent.

Solutions (10–3 M) of the
compounds 12–15 in the deuterated solvent of choice
were used to record the 1H NMR spectra. Table 1 reports the tc values expressed in Δppb/ΔK
highlighted in different colors for CDCl3 and DMSO for
the related diastereoisomers. The results indicate that in CDCl3, the four glycine diastereoisomers 12 and 13 display somewhat a borderline situation since the values
of the amide protons are in the range of 2.5–4.0 Δppb/ΔK
similarly to that for the NHBoc protons.

K) and in DMSO (298.15–348.15 K) for l-valine
derivatives 14a, 14b, 15a,
and 15b.

Some
differences can be noted between compounds 12a,12b and 13a,13b: in these
latter two compunds, tc values can reach remarkably
low values as a mark of negligible temperature effect on proton accessibility.
The tc values in DMSO indicate that the amide protons,
ranging from 2.4 to 3.8 Δppb/ΔK for all of the four glycine
substrates, are inaccessible to the solvent, while NHBoc protons have
Δppb/ΔK values higher than the threshold (7.6–9.4
Δppb/ΔK), indicating the solvent accessibility of those
protons. Analogous considerations can be done over the four l-valine diastereoisomers 14 and 15 that
again display a borderline behavior for both the amide and NHBoc protons
in CDCl3, while the tc values in DMSO
indicate that the amide protons, ranging from 4.0 to 5.0 Δppb/ΔK
(a little higher with respect to the glycine ones) for all of the
four l-valine substrates, are inaccessible to the solvent,
while NHBoc protons have Δppb/ΔK higher values (7.0–10.5
Δppb/ΔK), indicating that those protons can be accessed
by the solvent.

Furthermore, we performed DMSO titration experiments
with gradual
DMSO addition to CDCl3 solutions (10–3 M) of the eight diastereoisomers 12–15. Figure 3 shows the
plots of the glycine (top) and l-valine (bottom) compounds.
The first set of results concerning the glycine derivatives indicated
clearly that amide protons chemical shifts remain almost unchanged
over the addition of increasing amounts of DMSO to the CDCl3 solutions; the range of variation ΔNH is 0.17–0.30
ppm, indicating a very low accessibility of the amide proton, engaged
in H-bonding with the ester oxygen atom. A larger chemical shift variation
is noted for the NHBoc protons with ΔNH values in the interval
of 0.82–1.41 ppm, being these protons prone to be attached
by the DMSO molecule through H-bond.

derivatives 14 and 15.

The second set of results concerning the l-valine
derivatives
showed little variations with respect to previous results. Amide protons
chemical shifts remain almost unchanged over the addition of increasing
amounts of DMSO to the CDCl3 solutions, but the range of
variation ΔNH is shifted at slightly higher values (0.25–0.77
ppm), indicating a low accessibility of the amide proton, still engaged
in a less tight H-bonding with the ester oxygen atom. A larger chemical
shift variation is observed for the NHBoc protons with ΔNH values
in the range of 1.27–1.85 ppm, indicating the accessibility
through H-bonding.

The reported results enforce the indication
that the oxazanorbornenes
chemistry gives the possibility to synthesize stereo-ordinated constrained
aminols holding the geometrical features to be used as turn inducers.
The driving force that makes these products induce β-turns very
efficiently is strictly related to the presence of a fused isoxazolinic
ring to the cyclopentane moiety. This latter usually adopts an envelope
conformation with the flap directed toward the isoxazoline ring, thus
showing a boatlike appearance to the bicyclic system.

For the
sake of confirmation, we have located the relevant boat-
and chair-like conformations of the turn structures 12a,12b–15a,15b obtained
through DFT calculations at the B3LYP/6-31g(d) level.20 The optimized structures of simplified compounds 12a,12b and 14a,14b are shown in Figure 4 (phenyl group of isoxazoline moiety was replaced with hydrogen).
The other structures relative to compounds 13a,13b and 15a,15b are reported in
the SI. The chairlike conformations of
compounds 12a,12b and 14a,14b were found higher in energy than the boatlike ones by
4–6 kcal/mol. The boatlike conformations in fact allow for
the relief of nonbonded interactions between the heterocyclic ring
and the substituents on the adjacent cyclopentane carbons. Furthermore,
the dihedral angles between the H4 and H5 isoxazoline protons and
the adjacent trans cyclopentane protons are close to 90°.22 This geometry results in a flattening of the
cyclopentane envelope pushing the amino and hydroxy groups close to
each other at H-bond distances that, in the compounds in hand, range
between 2.23 and 2.29 Å. These structures are maintained even
when the amino and hydroxyl groups are the anchors for amino acid
side chains that can emerge from other intramolecular H-bonding interactions.
This determines of course a further stabilization, but it is not detrimental
to be lost if polar substituents are needed to be located externally
to the turn structures, leaving the amino acidic residues to float
inside the turn arms or in closer positions. The cost of this conformation
changes is modest, up to 1.4 kcal/mol.

Figure 4 Boat- and chair-like
conformations of simplified compounds 12a,12b and 14a,14b. Values in italics correspond
to the intramolecular H-bonding (Å)
and those close to the numbers to the relative energies (kcal/mol).
Labels to the compound numbers: 2 H-bonds (b2), 1 H-bond (b1), and chairlike compounds (c).

These results can somewhat explain the failure
of the insertion,
in this type of turn structures, of more encumbered amino acids. A
similar view can be found for compounds 13a,13b and 15a,15b (see Figure S3 in the SI).

Due to the specificity of the aminol structures,
the elongation
on both the arms with amino acids produces the situation illustrated
in Figure 4. The boatlike
conformation of the aminols guarantees a bonded arrangement for the
turn structure. This happens precisely when the amino acids bear simple
substituents, such as the cases of glycine and l-alanine.
If larger groups are located on the amino acid chains, then the results
depend on their steric demand. l-Valine could be easily inserted
on one side of the aminol structure in the presence of the l-alanine on the other side. Again, spectroscopic investigations,
including tc measurements and NMR titrations, as
well as chiroptical properties, revealed a β-turn arrangement
of all of the synthesized compounds, where a little divergence of
the side chains is not detrimental. From the absolute configuration
of the cyclopentane spacer, they can be labeled as left- or right-handed
turns. Because of the constraints imposed by the fused isoxazoline
ring, the nonbonded arrangement cannot be a preferred structure even
when larger substituents have to be allocated. This constitutes a
quite strong limitation for the use of aminols 6a,6b in the design of turn scaffolds, and it was experimentally
verified by trying to link a l-tryptophan moiety instead
of glycine/l-valine and in the presence of another amino
acids in the opposite side. Every attempt failed reasonably because
of the steric hindrance determined by the indole ring that cannot
find space within the structure.

Conclusions
In
conclusion, the synthesized diastereoisomeric compounds represent
the reliable “proof” for the use of aminols, simple
and easily prepared, for the synthesis of nonpeptidic turn inducers.
We confirmed the crucial role of the cyclopenta[d]isoxazoline aminol structures in the formation of the β-turn
arrangement. The performed experiments ascertained the influence of
the two side chains features on the applicability/reliability/robustness
of these scaffolds as β-turn inducers and the limitations in
terms of amino acid choice determined by the strong conformational
preference of the bidimensional heterocyclic aminols.

Melting points (mp) are uncorrected and were determined
by the
capillary method. Elemental analyses were done on an elemental analyzer
equipment available at the Department of Chemistry of the University
of Pavia. 1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded
on 300 and 400 MHz spectrometers (solvents are specified in the text).

(nujol mulls) were recorded on a spectrophotometer available at the
Department, and absorptions (ν) are measured in cm–1. CD spectra were recorded on a spectropolarimeter at the Centro
Grandi Strumenti (CGS) of the University of Pavia equipped with Spectra
Analysis program. Column chromatography, thin-layer chromatography,
and medium-pressure liquid chromatography: silica gel H60 and GF254, respectively; eluants: from cyclohexane/ethyl acetate
9:1 to pure ethyl acetate.

Starting and Reference Materials
Aminols 6a,6b were prepared according to
the established procedures.14,15

TBDMSiCl, imidazole, N-Boc-l-Ala,
HBTU, DIEA, n-Bu4NF, N-Boc-Gly, DIC, DMAP, and N-Boc-Val were purchased
from chemical suppliers. Solvents and other reagents were also purchased
and used as they were, without any further purification.

The
protected amines 7a,7b, the alanine
diastereomeric compounds 8a,8b and 9a,9b, and the deprotected alanine ones 10a,10b and 11a,11b were prepared according to the well-established procedure reported
in the literature13 and were found identical
to authentic samples available in our laboratories.

General Procedure
for the Coupling of the Alcohol Derivatives 10a,10b and 11a,11b with N-Boc-Glycine
and N-Boc-Valine
To a solution of the deprotected
alanine compounds 10a,10b and 11a,11b (typically 1.0 g scale) in 50 mL CH2Cl2, 2 equiv. of DIC were added along with a catalytic
amount of DMAP. N-Boc-glycine or N-Boc-valine (1.30 equiv.) were then added to the reaction mixtures,
which were left under stirring at room temperature for 48 h. The diluted
solutions (50 mL of DCM was added) were washed with brine (50 mL)
and water (2 × 50 mL), and the collected organic phases were
dried over anhydrous Na2SO4. The residues, obtained
from evaporation of the solvent, were submitted to chromatographic
separation to yield desired compounds 12a,12b–15a,15b. The products were fully
characterized.
