B-doped single-walled carbon nanotubes
have been synthesized from
sodium tetraphenyl borate and record incorporation percentages of
B heteroatoms have been found in this material as-synthesized. However,
carbonaceous impurities, besides other byproducts, can still contain
boron and therefore exhibit various types of competing bonding environments.
To circumvent this issue, which has constantly hindered a conclusive
insight to the existing bonding environments in materials alike, we
have employed a purification method, which leaves ∼7% at. of
B atoms of the total sample composition almost exclusively in the
sp2 configuration. This record B substitutional doping,
together with the identification of the competing bonding environments
are revealed here unambiguously from X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy.
The doping level in the purified tubes is about an order
of magnitude larger than in other B-doped single-walled tubes even
without purification, and brings the state-of-the-art closer
to the controlled applicability of this material.

Introduction
The research seeking to control the physical
properties of carbon
nanotubes has led to propose creative functionalization pathways with
different degrees of accuracy.1−3 Chemically stimulating the tube’s
functionality by p- or n-type doping has been sought both theoretically
and experimentally with substitutional dopants such as N, B, P, Si,
and Ni so far.4−6 Heteroatoms at the carbon sites are expected to be
a very promising candidate to have localized sites that induce changes
in the physical properties of the tubes with very specific characteristics.7−9 To make this feasible, it is imperative to control the dopant’s
concentration and bonding environment. However, this is still one
of the major challenges in the field.10 A very large number of publications on the synthesis and some applications
of single-walled and multiwalled N-doped nanotubes are available,1,3 whereas experimental research for the other mentioned dopants lags
far behind. Nowadays, B-doped single-walled carbon nanotubes (CBx-SWNTs)
can be produced in significant amounts with high temperature methods
(arc discharge and laser ablation).11−13 Another effective way
found in the literature corresponds to substitution reactions,14−16 but the highly desirable scalability at lower cost via chemical
vapor deposition has constantly encountered drawbacks that limit the
yield of CBx-SWNTs.17−20 B-doping on nanotubes has not only been difficult from the sample
production perspective. Identifying the percentages of heteroatoms
has constantly shown difficulties because of the low incorporation
rates of substitutional atoms, which have imposed instrumental challenges
for their detection.21−24 Most of the initial studies were done with Raman spectroscopy, given
the extremely low incorporation of B, which hindered the effective
use of analytical methods.11,13,25 In fact, the B-doping level in CBx-SWNTs has historically been investigated
indirectly using as reference the amounts of B in the materials used
for the synthesis. Also, the bulk solubility of B in C hinted a plausible
limit of incorporation of heteroatoms in the structures,26 but it is important to bear in mind that the
atomic arrangement in a structure like a nanotube could open a different
perspective. On the other hand, the production of BC3 nanotubes
and carbon SWNTs with BC3 nanodomains has also been reported.27,28 Taking this into consideration, B-doped samples could have nanodomains
or islands of BC3, which are not necessarily in Raman resonance,
and therefore their contribution to the quantification of doping levels
must be carefully considered. Also, independent from the method used
for synthesis, the presence of carbonaceous byproducts cannot be avoided
and in samples as-synthesized, B atoms can also be detected from agglomerates
and structures that are not necessarily nanotubes. In this context,
the last decade’s research on carbon nanotubes has shown tremendous
progress in the production of samples almost free of impurities through
different purification and separation methods.29−31 However, substitutionally
doped nanotubes have rarely been purified after synthesis, bearing
in mind the potential reactivity of the active heteroatom sites.32 We have worked toward the production of CBx-SWNTs
based on the use of sodium tetraphenyl borate, which is a solid C
and B source, in high-vacuum chemical vapor deposition as reported
previously.33 This method reported the
incorporation of up to 13 at. % of boron atoms in the sp2 configuration in the samples as-grown, but the exclusive localization
of these atoms on the tubes’ wall could not be concluded. Here,
we report the possibility to optimize the amount of nanotube material
versus impurities. The B atoms are bonded to C in the sp2 configuration with record values around 7% at. in samples alike.
The competing species in the byproducts that contain B and appear
before and after purification are not related with C, and they can
be removed with independent chemical processes.

Results and Discussion
Our CBx-SWNT synthesis process involves the chemical vapor deposition
of a vapor of sodium tetraphenyl-borate obtained from the sublimation
of the solid precursor.33 Assuming the
temperature window for the synthesis of the CBx-SWNTs is given by
the eutectic limit of the catalysts and the sodium tetraphenyl borate
pyrolysis temperature, the optimal nanotube growth could be defined,34 but the temperature window for optimal B incorporation
is narrow. Taking both into account, we applied various purification
processes and two of them were optimized toward obtaining clean and
crystalline material, as reported here. The purification procedures
were performed using mild chemical oxidation to achieve a better understanding
of the B incorporation. The two protocols discussed from this point
were (S1) HCl and (S2) HCl + H2O2 (both in aqueous
solution).

Analyzing both purification pathways toward keeping
the crystallinity
of the material, the first part of our studies was focused on the
overall morphology via Raman spectroscopy and electron microscopy. Figure 1a shows a multifrequency
study on the two purification methods employed against the spectra
recorded for pristine material. The top spectra (in color) correspond
to the samples as-synthesized. For these purposes, the 633, 532, 514,
and 488 nm excitation wavelengths were used to record spectra on the
radial breathing mode (RBM) resonance region. The samples contain
predominantly SWCNTs, revealing the strongest RBM response between
140 and 270 cm–1 corresponding to diameters between
0.89 and 1.9 nm determined by RBM = 223/dt + 10.35 This is a representative sample of the highest
abundance region for tubes produced with sodium tetraphenyl borate.33 The vertical dashed lines are a guide to the
eye to identify this size region. Compared to the previously reported
material synthesized with high vacuum chemical vapor deposition, these
nanotubes have a slightly larger diameter distribution36 but still small compared to the most pure carbon
nanotubes made with the same technique.37−39 However, the yield in
this case is clearly larger, which has actually allowed us to purify
the CBx-SWNTs and in turn is the reason why previously reported materials
were not purified. Focusing on the spectra recorded after purification,
we can observe that both processes destroy the smaller diameter tubes,
and although some thin tubes are observed in the RBM region, it is
not possible to state unambiguously that one or the other process
is better to preserve a certain diameter population. On the other
hand, both processes have damaged the tubes above 1.5 nm. This end
product is analogous in diameter distribution to the pristine purified
samples made from DIPs, arc discharge, and laser ablation.

Figure 1 (a) Multifrequency
Raman spectra recorded with 633, 532, 514, and
488 nm excitation wavelengths in the RBM region corresponding to the
sample synthesized at the optimal synthesis temperature and the same
purified with methods S1 and S2. (b) Raman spectra recorded on the
same three samples with the 488 nm laser line on the G and D band
region.

To complement this study, we measured
optical absorption, and the
spectra recorded from the S2-purified and the nonpurified material
(not shown here) were weighed against each other. Clearly, the purified
material has a more defined fine structure and the diameter distribution
of the samples remains after purification but with different abundances.
Still, the effect of the dopants given by observable shifts on the
optical absorption of these materials is a part of ongoing studies.

Additionally, buckypapers of the material right after S1 and S2
were observed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), whereas dispersed
samples were seen using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). After
purification with S1, agglomerates (presumably carbonaceous) and rests
with the typical morphology of catalyst supports were still present
in the sample. However, the material purified with S2 exhibited much
more homogeneous nanotube morphology. Figure 2b is a low magnification image of the S2-purified
material, where a clean and homogeneous film can be seen. Figure 2c shows a TEM micrograph
with long strands of very straight CBx-SWNTs. From the point of view
of preserving the shape and low defect concentration, combined with
a good purity, the purification method S2 showed better performance.
Furthermore, it is well understood that purification methods of pristine
tubes can induce specific types of defects in the end material.30 Here, it is therefore crucial to understand
how the applied purification procedures change the starting CBx-SWNTs.
The first clues in this respect can be provided by Raman spectroscopy,
although it does not represent a pathway to quantify absolute values
of dopants in SWNTs. However, it may allow understanding p- and n-type
doping because of the modifications in the Kohn anomaly.40Figure 1b shows the G and D band region recorded with a 488 nm excitation
wavelength. The G line in the top spectrum corresponds to the sample
as-synthesized. One can observe a clear separation and characteristic
frequency of the G– and G+ split of the
G band. This is a clear evidence for a good crystallinity of the as-grown
material. Although the top spectrum shows this more structured and
outspread response compared to the spectra recorded after purification,
the shift of the G-line main component depends on which tubes are
mainly in resonance with the excitation wavelength. Combining the
information gained from Raman spectroscopy, optical absorption, and
TEM imaging and comparing the results shown here with the CBx-SWNTs
produced in our and other groups, this material represents a significant
step forward toward the controllable production of tubes with a defined
morphology, which is necessary for explaining questions remaining
from the point of view of fundamental research on physical properties
of B-doped nanotubes. The next step is corroborating the incorporation
of the dopants on the nanotube walls rather than as part of the synthesis
byproducts.

To understand the elemental composition of the
samples as-produced
and after purification, we made use of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS) to determine the nature of different elements and to understand
their bonding environments. The spectrometer’s Al Kα
source was used with pass energies of 200 eV for survey scans and
100 and 50 eV for high-resolution scans. The measurements on samples
purified with both S1 and S2 revealed the presence of C, B, and O,
followed by small amounts of Fe, Na, and Cl. Comparing the spectra
recorded on samples with and without purification, the intensity of
the C 1s signal turns at least three times stronger, confirming the
presence of carbonaceous species in the predominant amount. On the
other hand, the survey studies of the sample made using the purification
procedure S2 show a sharper B 1s line and amounts below 0.5 at. %
of other elements. It is therefore necessary to focus on the carbon
core signal to start this analysis. Previous studies done with high
resolution photoemission on pristine SWNTs have shown that the fine
structure in the C 1s line can be used to discern the presence of
the single-walled tubes with a specific binding energy.41−43 The full width at half maximum (fwhm) of the C 1s is around ∼0.4
eV for purified samples of pristine SWNTs measured with photoemission
spectroscopy at synchrotron facilities with optimal resolution.42,43 However, the prerequisite for such type of study is the use of samples
with narrow diameter distribution (narrower at least in half of the
value we have in the samples of this study). On the other hand, the
best values reported for CBx-SWNTs measured with the laboratory-based
equipment are around ∼1 eV, but it is important to remark that
those nanotubes were produced via high-temperature methods and are
less defective than chemical vapor deposition (CVD) tubes. Furthermore,
the doping levels in those previous studies were one order of magnitude
smaller than the values reported here, as explained later. In this
context, given that the introduction of defects in the hexagonal wall
of a nanotube induces disorder, broadening and shifts on the C 1s
line are naturally expected.

Figure 3a shows
the C 1s signal recorded from the nanotubes as-grown and purified
with S1 and S2 with corresponding fwhm of ∼1.86, ∼1.7,
and ∼1.5 eV. The spectra corresponding to the samples after
purification exhibit a Doniac–Sunjic line shape. The reduction
of the spectral contribution at higher binding energies is consistent
with the elimination of amorphous carbonaceous impurities.41 As stated above, these values are higher than
those corresponding to purified SWCNT films. However, this broadening
in the purified CBx-SWNTs cannot be attributed exclusively to impurities
beyond 1% as in the case of the arc discharge material in ref (41) because the introduction
of B dopants in the lattice is much larger, and also the C 1s has
two broadening contributions. First, a down shift has been observed
for doped samples, substantiated by previous reports,18,36,41 suggesting that the first B neighboring
atoms in carbon systems are responsible for this shift. On the other
hand, with the introduction of B, asymmetries arise around the band
gap because of the mixing of the π orbitals, which should add
to other morphological effects such as defects and vacancies extending
the linewidth to higher binding energies.

Figure 3 (a) C 1s core level spectra
recorded with a photon excitation energy
of 1486.7 eV from an Al Kα source. From top to bottom, the spectra
correspond to a sample grown at 770 °C and after the two purification
procedures. (b) Deconvolution of the B 1s core level spectrum recorded
from the sample purified with procedure S2.

Before turning to the B 1s analysis, it is worth keeping
in mind
that survey scans revealed the presence of O in the samples, therefore
the samples were heated at 600 °C, which is sufficient to remove
adsorbed O. This leads to the conclusion that the O content in the
samples arises from a compound that must contain B because the residual
presence of the supporting catalyst (MgO) can be disregarded after
the purification. The B 1s measurements of the samples can interestingly
be deconvoluted into different line profiles. Although in both cases,
a line width narrowing above 0.25 eV is observed compared to the unpurified
material as reported in ref (33), for both purification methods a downshift is seen, which
is slightly more pronounced in the case of S2. We have applied Voigt
symmetric spectral deconvolution adjusting a Gaussian resolution component
in order to unravel the bonding environments contributing to the B
1s line. Figure 3b
shows a spectrum corresponding to S2 in the optimal synthesis temperature.
As observed, besides the substitutional configuration, in this case,
two components corresponding to boron oxide and substitutional boron
(shaded) are found. Signals between 191.5 and 192.1 eV have been consistently
reported for B in the substitutional configuration for CBx-SWNTs and
also in double-walled and multiwalled nanotubes.18,36,41,44 None of those
materials were purified, but in our case, after employing both purification
methods , we are able to confirm that this component first observed
from the onset of the B 1s edge in EELS experiments45 and later observed for nanotubes directly with XPS (as
mentioned above) indeed corresponds to the B bonding environment in
the sp2 configuration. Our best fits suggest that the position
of the substitutional B component is around 191.65 eV once the material
is purified. The other two components that can be seen in our purified
samples correspond to boron oxide (192.8 eV) and boric acid (193.6
eV). To better understand the B incorporation profile in these samples, Figure 4 shows a histogram
summarizing the B bonding environments identified in CBx-SWNT samples
as-synthesized versus the material obtained after both purification
methods. The three different patterns in the bars correspond to three
different bonding environments from left to right: boric acid, boron
oxide, and B in the sp2 configuration.

on samples as-grown and after the use
of the purification procedures S1 and S2.

The sample purification procedures have both advantages and
disadvantages
if we examine the type of remaining bonding environments after they
have been applied. In the raw sample, substitutional B corresponds
to the largest component of the spectrum; meanwhile; boric acid and
boron oxide are present. The same three components remain after the
procedure S1 but in different proportions. The formation of boric
acid in the raw material is most likely due to the adsorption of water
in the porous catalyst previous to the synthesis process, taking into
account that this material was made in a two-stage high-vacuum CVD
system and this is unavoidable. However, the component of boric acid
is significantly reduced with S1 but it is eliminated with S2, suggesting
that the use of H2O2 is additionally useful
in the removal of the rests of boric acid efficiently.46 This is consequent with the proportions of boron
oxide and substitutional boron observed in the profile resulting for
the procedure S2. Here, it is remarkable that most of the B contained
in a sample purified with this last sequence is predominantly in substitutional
configuration. Because the stability of boron oxide clusters is still
not understood and studies have suggested that their chemistry and
stability could depend on their size,47 the efforts toward the complete purification of CBx-SWNTs need to
overcome this challenge. Also, the homogeneity of the heteroatom distribution
along the tube should be the focus of future research with more local
probes.

Conclusions
We have applied purification techniques
to CBx-SWNTs with very
high B contents and found distinctive and remarkable aspects as compared
to other nanotubes synthesized with methods alike. First, these type
of nanotubes produced from a solid precursor are able to incorporate
B atoms in an order of magnitude above any other method used to produce
these materials. We have been able to unravel the bonding environments
that make part of the B 1s core level signal recorded in XPS before
and after purifying the nanotubes with two different methods. We have
observed that using water peroxide can be very effective toward the
removal of boric acid. However, the highest competing bonding environment
for substitutional boron is boron oxide, and its removal should be
the matter of further intensive studies. These results pave the way
toward the purification of substitutionally doped nanotubes not only
for B as heteroatoms but with a broader perspective.

Methods
A high-vacuum two-stage heating CVD procedure was used for synthesis
as reported elsewhere.48 These CBx-SWNTs
have observable diameters from ∼0.89 to ∼1.9 nm and
a B incorporation of up to 13% at. These results hold the record in
B content among materials alike produced with both high and low temperature
synthesis methods. Subsequent purification procedures were performed
using mild chemical oxidation. Two aqueous acid solutions were prepared:
(S1) HCl and (S2) HCl + H2O2. The raw nanotube
material was first purified immersing the black powder in deionized
water and subsequently dispersing this suspension with the diluted
HCl solution S1; given the chemistry of the compounds present in this
step, we could not rule out the formation of NaCl because of residual
Na contained in the sodium tetraphenyl borate molecule. Therefore,
a small amount of NaOH (0.5 M) was used for its removal. The nanotubes
were filtered and dispersed in water at 90 °C in order to eliminate
NaCl and H3BO3 simultaneously. Finally, the
aqueous solution was filtered and heated at 380 °C for 2 h to
remove any remaining amorphous carbon. The same sequence was followed
with the S2 mix. As the last step, an 800 °C heating treatment
for 1 h was applied to stabilize the structures. Raman spectra were
recorded with a Horiba Jobin LabRAM HR800 spectrometer equipped with
a liquid nitrogen-cooleddetector. All spectra were recorded in ambient
conditions with a 180° backscattered light. XPS was done with
a Scienta Spectrometer equipped with a monochromatic Al Kα source
(1486.6 eV) and a hemispherical RS4000 photoelectron analyzer, operating
at a base pressure of 6 × 10–10 mBar.
