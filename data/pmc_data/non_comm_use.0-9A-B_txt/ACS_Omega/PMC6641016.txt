The
autoxidation reactions of 2-acyl-2,3-dihydroquinazolin-4(1H)-ones 4a and 5a and 2,2′-bis(dihydroquinazolinone) 6a are described. These reactions generate aminyl radicals
that undergo β-C–C cleavage, and subsequent reactions
of the resulting C-based radicals with O2 lead to diverse
products with good selectivity, depending on the structure of the
substrate. Oxidation of 4a, in which the 2-acyl group
is part of a cyclic acenaphthenone unit, yields a heterocyclic C-hydroperoxylaminal via 1,2-acyl migration. Oxidation of 5a, which contains a 2-acetyl group, yields peracetic acid
and a quinazolinone product. Oxidation of 6a forms a
bis(quinazolinone) by net dehydrogenation.

Introduction
Aminyl
radicals are generated by the decomposition of R2N–X
compounds (X = N, O, S, halogen, pyridine-2-thioneoxycarbonyl,
etc.),1−3 addition of carbon radicals to imines,4 and H-atom abstraction from secondary amines
via free-radical or proton-coupled electron transfer mechanisms.5 Aminyl radicals undergo a variety of synthetically
useful reactions, including H-atom abstraction, addition to alkenes6 and polar multiple bonds,7−9 and β-cleavage
(Scheme 1).10,11 One example of the latter process is oxidation of 2,2-disubstituted
2,3-dihydroquinazolin-4(1H)-ones to form 2-substituted
quinazolin-4(3H)-ones (Scheme 2), which are of interest for their potential
biomedical applications.12−16 Wang and Tang and co-workers investigated the Cu-catalyzed aerobic
oxidation of 2,2-disubstituted dihydroquinazolinones (A) and exploited this reaction in the tandem construction of quinazolinones.17,18 A mechanism involving Cu-mediated single-electron oxidation at N1, followed by deprotonation to yield an aminyl radical and
subsequent β-C–C cleavage, was proposed. Similarly, Moore
and co-workers showed that KMnO4 oxidation of 2-benzoyl-2-phenyl
dihydroquinazolinone C led to elimination of the benzoyl
group, with formation of 2-phenylquinazolinone D.19

2,3-Dihydroquinazolin-4(1H)-ones
Here, we report the unusually facile autoxidation
reactions of
2-acyl-2,3-dihydroquinazolin-4(1H)-ones 4a and 5a and 2,2′-bis(dihydroquinazolinone) 6a. These reactions generate aminyl radicals that undergo
β-C–C cleavage, and subsequent reactions of the resulting
C-based radicals with O2 lead to diverse products, with
good selectivity, depending on the structure of the substrate.

Results and Discussion
Synthesis of 4a, 4b, and 5a
As part of a project related to amide-functionalized
α-diimine
ligands,20 we prepared 2-acyl 2,3-dihydroquinazolin-4(1H)-ones 4a, 4b, and 5a. o-Aminobenzamides 1a, 1b undergo TsOH-catalyzed condensation with acenaphthenequinone (2) to yield spiro(dihydroquinazolinone)s 4a, 4b in 88–94% yield (Scheme 3). Similar Brønsted acid21,22 or Lewis acid23-catalyzed syntheses of
spiro(dihydroquinazolinone)s have been reported. Dihydroquinazolinone 5a was prepared in a similar manner from butanedione (3, Scheme 3).

Scheme 3 The structure of 4a was confirmed by X-ray
diffraction
(Supporting Information (SI)). The Cspiro–C(=O) bond (1.576(5) Å) is significantly
longer than typical sp3-C–C(=O) single bonds
(1.511 Å)24 due to ring strain in
the acenaphthene 5-membered ring. The 1H NMR spectra of 4a, 4b, and 5a exhibit two doublets
and a septet for the desymmetrized isopropyl groups due to the presence
of the stereogenic carbon center. The 13C NMR resonances
for the spiro carbon for all three compounds appear at δ ca.
75.

Observation of 1:2 Condensation
The 1:2 condensation
between 2 and 1a is disfavored due to steric
congestion around the ketone unit in 4a. However, the
Sc(OTf)3-catalyzed condensation of 2 with
2 equiv of 1a in tBuOH at 120 °C affords
a small amount (6%) of the bicondensation product 6a,
along with 94% of 4a (Scheme 4). 6a was isolated in 1% yield
by fractional recrystallization under N2.

Scheme 4 X-ray diffraction analysis of 6a revealed
the RR/SS
configuration of the two spiro chiral centers (Figure 1). 6a has an approximate C2-symmetry, with the C2 axis running along the central C–C bond of the naphthalene
unit. The C–C bond between the two spiro carbon atoms (C12–C23,
1.681(2) Å) is long, as observed for other 1,1,2,2-tetrasubstituted
acenaphthenes,25−27 due to steric crowding between the two dihydroquinazolinone
units. The aryl rings of the two heterocyclic units stack intramolecularly
in a displaced face-to-face fashion, with a centroid–centroid
distance of 3.74 Å. The 13C NMR resonance of the spiro
carbons appears at δ 89.9, ca. 15 ppm downfield from that of 4a. The elongation of the C12–C23 bond causes planarization
of these carbon atoms, which may account for this unusual downfield
shift. The meso (RS/SR) diastereomer of 6a was not observed
and is likely disfavored by steric factors.

except for the H atoms on N1 and N3. Top: Oak Ridge thermal ellipsoid
plot. Bottom: space filling model showing the stacking of the aryl
rings.

Autoxidation of 4a
4a undergoes
oxidation under air over several days in CDCl3 at room
temperature to form N-aryl 1,8-naphthalimide 8a (Scheme 5), the structure of which was revealed by X-ray diffraction (SI). The 1H NMR spectrum of 8a is consistent with Cs symmetry
and contains a doublet for the NHMe group.

Scheme 5 To gain insight into the mechanism of formation of 8a, we studied the oxidation of 4a under O2. Compound 4a reacts with 1 atm O2 in halogenated
solvents (CH2Cl2, CHCl3, CCl4, C6H5F) to form hydroperoxide 7a (Scheme 5), with net incorporation of two oxygen atoms as evidenced by electrospray
ionization mass spectroscopy (ESI-MS). Under optimized conditions,
pure 7a was isolated in 85% yield from CCl4 at 65 °C.

The structure of 7a was revealed
by X-ray diffraction
(Figure 2). Compound 7a contains a central 6-membered lactam ring that results
from acyl migration from the spiro carbon of 4a to the
adjacent amine nitrogen. The O1–O2 bond length (1.4695(19)
Å) and the C1–O1–O2 angle (106.66(13)°) in 7a are similar to those in other C-hydroperoxylaminal28 and alkyl peroxide compounds.29 The hydroperoxy 1H NMR resonance appears at
δ 8.1 in dry CDCl3 but is shifted downfield to δ
9.9 in CD3CN and δ 11.3 in tetrahydrofuran (THF)-d8 due to hydrogen bonding with solvents. The
−OOH resonance exhibits a nuclear Overhauser
enhancement spectroscopy (NOESY) correlation with only one of the
isopropyl methyl doublets (Figure 3), in agreement with the proximal relationship observed
in the crystal structure. The 13C NMR resonance of the
hydroperoxy-bound carbon atom appears at δ 103.0, and this assignment
was confirmed by observation of a 3-bond correlation between this
carbon and the N–Me hydrogens in the heteronuclear
multiple bond correlation (HMBC) spectrum (Figure 3).

Figure 2 Molecular structures of 7a. Hydrogen
atoms are omitted
except for the H atom on O2.

Figure 3 Important NOESY and HMBC correlations for 7a.

Compound 7a undergoes
facile oxygen atom transfer
to PPh3 or Me2S at room temperature to form
imide 8a (Scheme 5). 7a also slowly degrades in CDCl3 solution to yield 8a. In this case, the identity of
the oxygen acceptor is unknown. These results show that 7a is an intermediate in the transformation of 4a to 8a. The conversion of 7a to 8a proceeds
via oxygen atom transfer to form intermediate C-hydroxylaminal 10a followed by formal N–H elimination (Scheme 6). Compound 8a can be conveniently synthesized in 92% isolated yield in a one-pot
two-step procedure by aerobic oxidation of 4a, followed
by reduction of 7a by Me2S.

Scheme 6 Mechanism of Conversion
of 4a to 7a
When 4a was heated under 1 atm O2 in CCl4 at 60 °C
for 1 h, 100% conversion to 7a (95%) and 8a (5%) was observed. However, only
5% conversion occurred in the presence of 1.6 equiv of the radical
inhibitor BHT. These results are consistent with the radical chain
mechanism shown in Scheme 7. Aminyl radical E, generated from 4a by H-atom abstraction or one-electron oxidation and loss of H+, undergoes ring expansion through a 1,2-acyl migration (intramolecular
β-C–C cleavage) to yield a C-based radical, F, which is stabilized by conjugation with the naphthalene ring. Trapping
of F by O2 and subsequent H-atom abstraction
from 4a forms 7a and regenerates E. The conversion of 4a to 7a may be initiated
by trace peroxy radicals or a SET/proton transfer mechanism and does
not require an external radical initiator.

Scheme 7 Proposed Mechanism
of Conversion of 4a,b to 7a,b
Autoxidation of 4b
In contrast to 4a, 4b does not
react with O2 in CD2Cl2 and CCl4 at room temperature. However, 4b does undergo
aerobic oxidation in the presence of acid
(100/1 mixture of CD2Cl2/CF3CO2H) to form imide 8b (77%) and compound 9 (18%) within 6 days at room temperature (Scheme 8). The identities of 8b and 9 were confirmed by independent synthesis
(Scheme 9) and X-ray
diffraction for 9 (SI). The
condensation between 1,8-naphthalic anhydride and 2-amino-3-isopropylbenzoic
acid yielded carboxylic acid 11, which was converted
to 8b by sequential reaction with SOCl2 and
NH3. Subsequent dehydration of 8b yielded 9.

Scheme 8 Scheme 9 Synthesis of 8b and 9
A plausible mechanism for the
formation of 8b and 9 by oxidation of 4b is shown in Scheme 8. First, autoxidation of 4b likely proceeds by
a similar radical mechanism, as observed
for 4a (Scheme 7), to form hydroperoxide 7b. The acid may catalyze
the H-atom transfer from 4b to the peroxyl radical in
a manner similar to that observed for H-atom transfer from phenols
to peroxyl radicals.30 The intermediate, 7b, undergoes oxygen atom transfer to afford C-hydroxylaminal 10b. 10b can undergo formal
N–H elimination to yield 8b, or double ring opening
through transannular C–N bond cleavage, followed by rearrangement
and dehydration to yield 9. The direct dehydration product
of 10b, 9′, was not observed and
is likely destabilized by the steric crowding between the iPr and amide groups, in agreement with previous observations by Lindeman
et al.31,32

Oxidative C–C Bond Cleavage of 5a
Compound 5a undergoes a facile C–C
bond cleavage
to yield quinazolinone 12 and peracetic acid in CD2Cl2, CDCl3 and C6D6 in the presence of O2 (Scheme 10). Under 1 atm O2 in CD2Cl2, the oxidation of 5a is complete within
a few hours at room temperature. Peracetic acid was identified by
NMR and by its reaction with PPh3 to generate O=PPh3. The autoxidation reaction of 5a likely proceeds
through a radical chain mechanism, involving β-cleavage of the
aminyl radical, G, to generate 12 and an
acetyl radical, followed by trapping of the latter species with O2 and H-atom abstraction (Scheme 11). BHT inhibits the autoxidation of 5a.

Scheme 10 Scheme 11 Autoxidation of 6a
Compound 6a undergoes autoxidation in CD2Cl2, CDCl3, and CD3CN to form 13 by net dehydrogenation
and cleavage of the strained acenaphthene C–C bond (Scheme 12). This reaction
likely proceeds by a radical chain process involving β-cleavage
of an initially formed aminyl radical to generate a C-based radical, H (Scheme 13). Subsequent H-atom abstraction by O2 yields 13 and the hydroperoxy radical, which abstracts a H-atom from 6a to complete the cycle. The byproduct, H2O2, was detected in the reaction in CD3CN. A similar
aerobic oxidative C–C cleavage reaction in a tetrasubstituted
acenaphthene system has been reported.33

Scheme 12 Scheme 13 Conclusions
2-Acyl-2,3-dihydroquinazolin-4(1H)-one and 2,2′-bis(dihydroquinazolinone)
compounds, which are the condensation products of 1,2-diketone and
anthranilamides, react with O2 under mild, metal-free conditions
through radical mechanisms. These reactions generate aminyl radicals
that undergo β-C–C cleavage, and subsequent reactions
of the resulting C-based radicals with O2 lead to diverse
products with good selectivity, depending on the structure of the
substrate. The reaction pathways include 1,2-acyl migration for 4a and 4b, in which the 2-acyl group is part
of a cyclic acenaphthenone unit, the formation of peracetic acid for 5a, in which the 2-acyl group is not part of a cyclic structure,
and the net dehydrogenation for 2,2′-bis(dihydroquinazolinone) 6a.

Experimental Section
General Procedures
Experiments were
conducted under
air with reagent grade solvents unless indicated otherwise. Nitrogen
was purified by passage through activated molecular sieves and Q-5
oxygen scavenger. Solvents for manipulations under N2 were
purified as follows: hexane was purified by passage through activated
alumina and BASF R3-11 oxygen scavenger, and THF and CH2Cl2 were purified by passage through activated alumina. tBuOH (anhydrous, ≥99.5%, Sigma-Aldrich), CCl4 (anhydrous, ≥99.5%, Sigma-Aldrich), acenaphthenequinone (2, >90.0%, Sigma-Aldrich), Sc(OTf)3 (>98.0%,
TCI),

were used as purchased. 2-Amino-3-isopropylbenzoic acid and 2-amino-3-isopropyl-N-methylbenzamide (1a) were synthesized by
literature procedures.20 CDCl3 and CD2Cl2 were distilled from P2O5 and stored under vacuum. C6D6 and THF-d8 were distilled from Na/benzophenone.
DMSO-d6 and CD3CN were used
as received.

NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker DRX-500 spectrometer
at room temperature. NMR samples under N2 or O2 atmosphere were prepared using Teflon-valved tubes. 1H and 13C chemical shifts are reported relative to SiMe4 and were determined by reference to the residual 1H and 13C solvent resonances. Coupling constants are given
in hertz (Hz). NMR assignments were made with the aid of correlation
spectroscopy (COSY), NOESY, heteronuclear multiple quantum coherence
(HMQC), and HMBC experiments.

Infrared spectra were recorded
on thin-film samples on NaCl plates
using a Nicolet NEXUS 470 FT-IR spectrometer. Mass spectrometry was
performed on an Agilent 6130 LCMS (low resolution) or Agilent 6224
Tof-MS (high resolution) instrument. The listed m/z value corresponds to the most intense peak in
the isotope pattern.

benzene (30 mL), and thionyl chloride (4 mL). The yellow suspension
was heated to reflux for 2.5 h to give an orange solution. The volatiles
were removed on a rotovap to yield the crude acyl chloride as a red

an aqueous NH3 solution (20 mL, 30 wt %) at 0 °C.
The mixture was stirred at 0 °C for 30 min and quenched with
water (ca. 100 mL). The THF was removed on a rotovap. The aqueous
residue was extracted with Et2O (3 × 30 mL). The organic
phase was washed with brine, dried with anhydrous MgSO4, filtered, and dried under vacuum to give a yellow solid residue.

added via syringe, and the mixture was heated at 80 °C under
N2 for 30 min, yielding an orange suspension. Water (20

2-Acetyl-2,3-dihydro-8-isopropyl-2,3-dimethylquinazolin-4(1H)-one (5a)
A Schlenk flask was charged
with butanedione (3, 1.36 mL, 15.6 mmol), 1a (7.08 g, 36.8 mmol, 2.36 equiv), TsOH·H2O (200 mg),
and benzene (50 mL) under N2. The flask was equipped with
a Dean–Stark trap filled with 4 Å molecular sieves and
a condenser. The mixture was refluxed for 3.5 days, cooled to room

A Teflon-valved Schlenk
flask was charged with 2 (182 mg, 1.00 mmol), 1a (384 mg, 2.00 mmol, 2.0 equiv), and Sc(OTf)3 (98 mg,
0.20 mmol, 0.20 equiv). Dry tBuOH (5 mL) was added via
syringe. The flask was sealed, and the mixture was heated at 120 °C
under N2 for 1 h and then cooled to room temperature to
yield an orange suspension. The 1H NMR spectrum of an aliquot
revealed that a 94/94/6 mixture of 1a/4a/6a was present. The volatiles were removed under vacuum.
The residue was dissolved in EtOAc (50 mL). The EtOAc phase was washed
with water and brine, dried with anhydrous MgSO4, filtered,
and dried under vacuum to give an orange solid residue. The residue
was subjected to two consecutive recrystallizations from hexane/EtOAc
(2/1 by volume), from which pure 4a (160 mg, 45%) was
collected in total. The mother liquor was dried under vacuum, and
the residue was recrystallized from hexane/CH2Cl2 at −40 °C under N2 to yield a solid mixture
of 1a and 4a. The mother liquor, which was
enriched in 6a, was dried under vacuum. Subsequent diffusion
of pentane into an EtOAc solution of this material at room temperature
under N2 yielded red crystals of 4a and colorless
crystals of 6a. The crystals of 6a were
separated from the mixture and recrystallized twice by diffusion of
hexane into a CH2Cl2 solution at room temperature
under N2 to afford colorless rod-shaped crystals of 6a that contained 0.34 equiv CH2Cl2 and
0.35 equiv hexane, as determined by 1H NMR integration

2-{1,3-Dioxo-1H-benz[de]isoquinolin-2(3H)-yl}-3-isopropyl-N-methylbenzamide (8a)
A flask was
charged with 4a (100
mg, 0.281 mmol) and CH2Cl2 (20 mL). The mixture
was stirred vigorously at room temperature for 48 h until the characteristic
yellow color of 3a faded completely and a white suspension
formed. 1H NMR analysis of an aliquot showed that a 96/4
mixture of 7a/8a was present. Me2S (30 μL, 0.408 mmol, 1.45 equiv) was added via a microliter
syringe. The mixture was stirred at room temperature to yield a pale-brownish
solution within 5 min and then a white suspension after 18 h. The
mixture was diluted with CH2Cl2 (30 mL), washed
with water (2 × 15 mL) and brine (20 mL), dried over anhydrous
Na2SO4, filtered, and dried under vacuum to
give an off-white powder. The crude product was purified by flash
column chromatography (silica, EtOAc) to yield 8a (96
mg, 92%) as an off-white powder. 1H NMR (DMSO-d6): δ 8.53 (dd, J = 8.2, 1.2, 2H),

Autoxidation of 4a in CDCl3 under Air
An NMR tube was charged with 4a (2.8 mg, 7.8 μmol).
CDCl3 (1.0 mL) was added to yield a yellow solution. The
tube was loosely capped and maintained in the dark at room temperature.
The 1H NMR spectrum showed that a mixture of 8a (87%) and unreacted 4a (13%) formed after 5 days.

Autoxidation of 4a in CDCl3 under O2
A J. Young NMR tube was charged with 4a (4.2
mg), and CDCl3 (ca. 0.6 mL) was added by vacuum
transfer at −196 °C. The sample was warmed to room temperature
and exposed to O2 (1 atm). The sample was sealed and maintained
at room temperature in the dark. The 1H NMR spectrum showed
that 4a was completely converted to 7a (87%)
and 8a (13%) within 20 h; slow conversion of 7a to 8a was observed after 20 h.

Reaction of 7a with PPh3
A
Teflon-valved NMR tube was charged with 7a (6.0 mg, 0.015
mmol) and PPh3 (4.6 mg, 0.018 mmol, 1.2 equiv), and CD2Cl2 (0.5 mL) was added by vacuum transfer at −196
°C. The tube was sealed and warmed to room temperature to yield
a white suspension, which turned to a colorless solution after gentle
agitation for 1 min. 1H and 31P{1H} NMR spectra showed that quantitative generation of 8a and O=PPh3 (1.0 equiv) had occurred within 15
min.

Reaction of 7a with Me2S
An
NMR tube was charged with 7a (3.1 mg, 8.7 μmol),
and CD2Cl2 (0.5 mL) was added to yield a white
suspension. Me2S (2.0 μL, 0.027 mmol, 3.5 equiv)
was added via syringe. The tube was capped and agitated briefly to
yield a colorless solution within 1 min. The tube was maintained at
room temperature, and the reaction was monitored by collecting 1H NMR spectra periodically. Quantitative generation of 8a and DMSO (1.0 equiv) occurred within 6 h.

Aerobic Oxidation
of 4b in CD2Cl2/CF3CO2H (100/1)
A J. Young
NMR tube was charged with 4b (2.7 mg), C6Me6 (ca. 1 mg), and CD2Cl2 (1.0 mL) under
air. The sample was sealed, and a 1H NMR spectrum was taken.
CF3CO2H (10 μL) was added, and the sample
was maintained open to air (the tube was capped but not sealed to
minimize solvent evaporation) at room temperature in the dark. The
reaction was monitored by 1H NMR. After 6 days, 4b was completely converted to yield 8b (77%) and 9 (18%) and trace unidentified products.

2-{1,3-Dioxo-1H-benz[de]isoquinolin-2(3H)-yl}-3-isopropylbenzoic
acid (11)
A flask was charged with 1,8-naphthalic
anhydride (990 mg, 5.00 mmol),
2-amino-3-isopropylbenzoic acid (896 mg, 5.00 mmol), DMF (15 mL),
and Et3N (0.70 mL, 5.0 mmol). The mixture was heated at
140 °C under air for 16 h. The volatiles were distilled off under
vacuum to yield a light yellow powder. The powder was suspended in
CH2Cl2 (30 mL), and aqueous HCl (2 M, 30 mL)
was added. A yellow solid precipitated and was collected by vacuum
filtration. The solid was recrystallized from hot MeOH and the resulting
yellow microcrystals were dried in a vacuum oven at 70 °C for
2 days to give pure 11 as a pale yellow powder. Yield:
968 mg (54%). 1H NMR (500 MHz, DMSO-d6): δ 12.77 (s, 1H), 8.56–8.53 (m, 4H), 7.96 (dd, J = 7.7, 1.2, 1H), 7.92 (t, J = 7.7, 2H),

2-{1,3-Dioxo-1H-benz[de]isoquinolin-2(3H)-yl}-3-isopropylbenzamide (8b)
A
flask was charged with 11 (539 mg, 1.50 mmol), benzene
(20 mL), and SOCl2 (3.0 mL, 4.5 mmol). The mixture was
heated to reflux for 4 h to afford a precipitate. The liquid (2/3)
was removed by distillation, and the remaining mixture was cooled
to room temperature. Hexane (ca. 50 mL) was added to precipitate the
acid chloride as a pale yellow powder. The powder was collected by
vacuum filtration, washed with hexane, and dried under vacuum. Yield:
523 mg (92%). A flask was charged with the acid chloride (400 mg,
1.06 mmol) and PhCl (10 mL). The suspension was heated to 90 °C
to yield a colorless solution. NH3 gas was bubbled through
the mixture at 90 °C for 50 min, and a white precipitate formed.
Hexane (10 mL) was added, and the white precipitate was collected
by vacuum filtration. The white solid was mixed with MeOH (15 mL),
stirred for 10 min, collected by vacuum filtration, washed with cold
MeOH, and dried under vacuum. 1H NMR (CDCl3):

13-Isopropylbenz[4,5]isoquino[1,2-b]quinazoline-7,9-dione
(9)
A flask was charged with 8b (200 mg, 0.558 mmol) and H2SO4 (98 wt %, 5
mL). The mixture was heated at 140 °C for 30 min to yield a clear
red solution. The mixture was poured over ice (100 g), and the resulting
yellow precipitate was collected by vacuum filtration, washed with
water, and dried under vacuum. The crude product was purified by flash
column chromatography (silica, hexane/EtOAc = 2/1 by volume) and reprecipitated
from hexane/EtOAc to yield a yellow powder. Yield: 127 mg (67%). 1H NMR (CDCl3): δ 8.99 (d, J = 7.4, 1H), 8.64 (d, J = 7.2, 1H), 8.24 (d, J = 7.4, 1H), 8.22 (d, J = 8.0, 1H), 8.12

Autoxidation of 5a in CD2Cl2 under O2
A J. Young NMR
tube was charged with 5a (6.0 mg), and CD2Cl2 (ca. 0.6 mL)
was added by vacuum transfer at −196 °C. The sample was
warmed to room temperature and exposed to O2 (1 atm). The
sample was sealed and agitated at room temperature in the dark for
1.5 h. The 1H NMR spectrum showed that formation of 12 (100%), peracetic acid (97%), and acetic acid (3%) had
occurred. The sample was degassed by three freeze–pump–thaw
cycles, and the volatiles were transferred into a second J. Young
NMR tube under vacuum. 1H and 13C NMR spectra
showed that the volatiles contained peracetic acid and a trace amount
of acetic acid. CD2Cl2 (ca. 0.6 mL) was added
to the first NMR tube under vacuum, and 1H and 13C NMR spectra confirmed the identity of 12. The formation
of trace AcOH is likely due to decomposition of peracetic acid, reaction
with unreacted 5a, or involvement of trace reductive
impurity.
