Copolymerization
of melamine with 2,4,6-triaminopyrimidine (TAP)
in an electrochemically induced polymerization process leads to the
formation of molecular doped poly(triazine imide) (PTI). The polymerization
is based on the electrolysis of water and evolving radicals during
this process. The incorporation of TAP is shown by techniques such
as elemental analysis, Fourier transform infrared and NMR spectroscopies,
and powder X-ray diffraction, and it is shown that the carbon content
can be tuned by the variation of the molar ratio of the two precursors.
This incorporation of TAP directly influences the electronic structure
of PTI and as a result, a red shift can be observed in UV–vis
spectroscopy. The smaller band gap and the increased absorption in
the visible range lead to improved photocatalytic properties. In dye
degradation experiments, it was possible to observe an increase of
the rate of the degradation of methylene blue by a factor of 4 in
comparison to undoped PTI or 7 if compared to melon.

Introduction
Carbon nitrides as
nontoxic and metal-free photocatalysts have
been of particular interest in the scientific community since the
discovery of photocatalytic water splitting by Wang et al. in 2009.1 The different degrees of polymerization and their
either triazine or heptazine-based structure can be obtained by different
synthesis procedures. These synthesis procedures lead to carbon nitride
materials such as melon (often referred as g-C3N4),2−5 poly(triazine imide) (PTI),6−9 poly(heptazine imide),10−12 and triazine-based graphitic
carbon nitride.13−15

Different paths were followed to improve the
photocatalytic properties
of these carbon nitrides. One example is to increase the specific
surface and to modify the morphology to increase the number of accessible
active sites. This can be done by exfoliation or by soft or hard template
methods, which often results in improved photocatalytic properties.16−18 Doping can be divided into molecular and elemental doping. Molecular
doping describes the incorporation of different molecules, for example
barbituric acid and 2,4,6-triaminopyrimidine (TAP).19−23 Another promising molecule for molecular doping is
2-aminobenzonitrile, which was used by Zhang et al. to dope g-C3N4. This doped carbon nitride has an increased
absorption in the visible range and improved photocatalytic properties
in hydrogen evolution experiments.24 Elemental
doping is achieved by the substitution of single atoms in the triazine
or heptazine building unit by elements such as O,25 C,26 P,27 S,28 B,29,30 I,31,32 and F.33,34 Also, the introduction of metals such as
Fe into carbon nitrides has been reported by Wang et al., which is
described as another approach to effectively tune the photocatalytic
properties of carbon nitrides.35

In this work, we focus on molecular doping of PTI and discuss a
facile variation of a novel synthesis that has been recently reported
by the authors.36 This approach is conducted
in an aqueous solution of melamine, in which between two platinum
electrodes a voltage is applied, which exceeds the potential of the
electrolysis of water. During the process of electrolysis, radical
species such as hydroxyl or superoxide radicals are formed. These
radicals react with the melamine precursor to form melamine radicals
which polymerize.37 In further experiments,
it was shown that hydroxyl radicals are expected to be the main species
in this reaction.36 Through step-wise substituting
melamine by TAP in this approach, it was possible to tune the optical
properties of PTI, leading to a significant improvement of the photocatalytic
properties. For the degradation of methylene blue (MB), a significant
increase of the degradation rate could be observed with an increasing
amount of TAP.

Results and Discussion
In order
to achieve the molecular doping of PTI as it is shown
in Figure 1, melamine
was substituted by TAP. Therefore, solutions were prepared with 0,
25, 50, 75, and 100 mol % of TAP. The total molar amount and the sodium
hydroxide concentration of melamine and TAP were constant. The reactions
were conducted in a vessel shown in the photograph in Figure SI1. The reactions were followed by UV–vis
spectroscopy for the evaluation of the reaction times. In accordance
to the Lambert–Beer law, the reactions were considered to be
completed when there were no further changes in the absorption spectra,
thus depicting a constant concentration of the product. These spectra
in Figure SI2 show that the reaction time
increases with the amount of TAP used in synthesis. After precipitation
using hydrochloric acid and a washing procedure, the product was freeze-dried
and the incorporation was demonstrated by applying different characterization
methods.

Figure 1 Structure of PTI is illustrated in gray. An s-triazine
unit, which has been substituted by a pyrimidine unit, is shown in
black. The exchange of nitrogen by carbon is marked red.

The powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern is shown
in Figure 2. It consists
of
two reflexes. The reflex at 27.75° is related to the (002) stacking
of conjugated aromatic systems.1 The calculated
interlayer distance is found to be 3.22 Å. With an increasing
amount of TAP substituting melamine in the synthesis, the position
is at a constant angle with an exception of the completely substituted
sample, which shows a slight shift to smaller angles (27.59°).
This behavior has been observed for other carbon nitrides and is explained
by the substitution of a nitrogen atom, resulting in reduced stability
and structural regularity.19,22 The increase of the
full width half maximum (fwhm) indicates that the stacking of the
single-layer PTI is decreased and smaller crystal domains are formed.
Using the Scherrer equation, sizes of 19.1 nm are found for PTI synthesized
using melamine, whereas the complete substitution leads to sizes of
7.5 nm. This trend is also observed for the reflex at 10.6°,
which is labeled (100) and is defined by an in-plane distance of 8.33
Å. It shows a slight shift toward larger angles with an increasing
amount of TAP in the synthesis. If melamine is completely substituted,
this reflex cannot be observed anymore, which has also been reported
for carbon nitrides which are prepared by the thermal condensation
of TAP or barbituric acid.22 The fwhm of
the (100) reflex and the calculated sizes decrease with increasing
molecular doping from 10.5 nm (0% TAP) to 6.7 nm (75% TAP). All in
all in XRD, a decrease in the crystalline quality of the product can
be observed in terms of the crystal size in the ab-plane as well as along the c-axis.

Figure 2 XRD pattern of PTI shows
two characteristic reflexes at 10.6°
and 27.7°, which are related to an in-plane periodicity (100)
and interlayer stacking (002), respectively (top). FTIR spectra of
TAP-doped PTI. The vibration at 2350 cm–1 which
is contributed by CO2 has been removed to improve the clarity
(bottom).

Figure 2 also shows
the Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra of the products. The
characteristic absorptions of carbon nitrides can be observed. The
peak at 805 cm–1 is defined by the out-of-plane
bending mode of the triazine ring. The region between 1800 and 1100
cm–1 shows various absorption maxima for imide-
and nitride-stretching vibrations. At 1445 and 1260 cm–1, the characteristic bands for C=N and C–NH–C
vibrations are found, respectively.9 The
presence of oxygen-containing functional groups such as C=O
or C–OH is indicated by the bands around 1730 and 1180 cm–1 and is in correspondence with the results of the
elemental analysis. The incorporation of oxygen has been reported
in a previous work and has its origin in the synthesis approach.36 The bands at 3350 and 3220 cm–1 are related to NH-stretching vibrations. The peak at 2350 cm–1 can be assigned to carbon dioxide. The FTIR spectra
of the 0, 25, 50, and 75% samples are similar apart from an increased
broadening of the peaks that can be observed with an increasing TAP
amount. This broadening indicates a lower structural order. The similarity
of the spectra of TAP-doped carbon nitrides was also recognized by
Ho et al.38 In contrast, the bands observed
for PTI 1660, 1535, 1445, and 1380 cm–1 disappear
in the 100% sample and two broad bands at 1633 and 1355 cm–1 appear. The peak at 1260 cm–1, which is assigned
to the C–NH–C vibration, can be observed at low intensities
for all of the samples.9 The low intensity
of this signal combined with the sizes calculated from the XRD pattern
shows the low degree of polymerization of the product. The intensity
of the out-of-plane bending mode of PTI, which is found at 805 cm–1, decreases with increasing amount of TAP used in
the synthesis and cannot be observed for the 100% sample.

The
incorporation of TAP was further verified by elemental analysis.
The amounts of carbon, nitrogen, and hydrogen were determined by combustion
analysis, whereas the amount of oxygen was provided by pyrolysis analysis.
The calculated sum formula of PTI is C3N4.5H1.5. The values found for the samples with different molar
percentages of TAP in the synthesis are presented in Table 1. The sum formula calculated
for 100% of TAP in the synthesis is C4N3.5H2.5. Oxygen and the increased amount of hydrogen, which are
present at a constant value in all the samples, are explained by adsorbed
water as well as by the incorporation of oxygen-containing functional
groups such as C–OH and COOH because of the synthesis method.36 The elemental analysis confirms the low degree
of condensation of the as-formed product. The difference from the
calculated and the measured nitrogen amount in the doped samples can
be explained by terminating amine groups. In general, it can be shown
that the C/N-ratio increases with the addition of TAP.

In 13C NMR spectra, which were recorded in deuterized
dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), two peaks at 166 and 150 ppm are observed.
These peaks can be assigned to the carbon next to the terminal NH2 group and the carbon next to the bridging NH group. For the
0, 25, and 50% TAP samples, only these two peaks are observed. The
75% TAP samples show additional peaks in the region between 166 and
150 ppm that are related to the changes in the chemical environment
by the carbon-substituted nitrogen in the triazine ring. This additional
carbon atom contributes to the spectrum by the peak at 73 ppm.39 For the 100% TAP samples, only this peak at
73 ppm and the peak at 150 ppm can be observed. The 13C
NMR spectra are shown in Figure SI3.

Figure 3A,B shows
two photographs of the different samples in liquid and solid state
as well as the spectra obtained by UV–vis spectroscopy and
photoluminescence (PL) measurements in solution (DMSO as the solvent).
The photographs show a colorless (solution) or pale yellowish color
(solid) for the 0% sample. With an increasing amount of TAP in the
synthesis, the samples turn yellow and orange. The 100% sample appears
brown. These observations are confirmed by the obtained spectra. The
absorption spectra are defined by a shoulder at 410 nm, which becomes
more pronounced with an increasing amount of TAP used in the synthesis.
A shift of the absorbance in the visible range is clearly observable
(Figure 3C). The solid-state
spectra and the corresponding Tauc plots show a main feature with
a Tauc gap between 3.3 and 3.4 eV for the 0, 25, 50, and 75% sample.
For the 100% sample, this feature can be found at 3.15 eV. A second
feature appears at a lower energy of 2.7 eV and can be observed for
the 25, 50, 75, and 100% sample (Figure SI4). Thus, with an increasing amount of TAP, an additional absorption
process takes place at lower energies compared to the regular absorption
of PTI. The normalized PL spectra show a broad peak at 425 nm for
the product with 0% of TAP in the synthesis (Figure 3D). This wavelength is slightly red-shifted
compared to values reported in the literature.40 The complete substitution of melamine by TAP results in
a red shift of this peak to 564 nm. The PL spectra for the 25, 50,
and 75% samples consist of several peaks, whose positions can be reconstructed
by multiplying the PL spectra of the 0 and 100% samples. The red shift
of the PL is in good agreement with the energy observed for the shoulder
in the absorption spectra and the calculated Tauc gap.

25, 50, 75, and 100% samples (from left to
right) in DMSO (A) and freeze-dried (B). UV–vis spectra (C)
and PL spectra (D) of the samples measured in DMSO.

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission
electron microscopy
(TEM) images, which are presented in Figure SI5, show no change in the morphology of the carbon nitride. The samples
consist of loosely arranged networks made of less than 100 nm wide
ribbon-like structures.

Prior to photocatalytic experiments,
the specific surface of the
catalyst was determined by Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET)-measurements.
For the 0, 25, 50, 75, and 100% TAP samples, specific surfaces of
51.4, 45.5, 42.5, 52.9, and 53.9 m2/g were found, respectively.
The observed values are similar and do not show any trend which could
be related to the amount of TAP used in the synthesis. Hence, changes
in the photocatalytic properties of the different samples cannot be
related to the specific surface.

Photocatalytic Experiments
Degradation
of MB
All the prepared samples were capable
of decomposing MB without the addition of any cocatalyst. The adsorption/desorption
equilibrium was set after 140 min stirring in the dark (Figure SI6). The calculated adsorption capacities
of the molar amount of MB per mass of the catalyst are similar for
all the samples (0.051 ± 0.006 mmol/g) and are in good agreement
with the PTI synthesized without sodium hydroxide (0.04 mmol/g).36 The multiplication of the adsorption capacity
by the Avogadro constant and the size of a MB molecule of 135 Å2 leads to an estimated surface value of 41.5 m2/g.41 This value is close to the specific
surfaces found by BET measurements. Therefore, it is assumed that
most of the surface is accessible by the MB molecules and a nearly
complete coverage is achieved. The obtained spectra are shown in Figure SI7. The logarithmic plots of the intensities
at the absorption maximum of MB are shown in Figure 4A. The evaluation of the observed degradation
rates, which is depicted in Figure 4B, shows an increase depending on the amount of TAP
used in the synthesis. The highest rate of 2.8 × 10–3 min–1 was observed for the sample, in which 75%
of melamine was substituted by TAP. We were able to boost the degradation
rate by a factor of 4 in relation to the rate of 0.6 × 10–3 min–1 of the pure PTI sample. We
explain the increased degradation rate by the enhanced overlap of
the lamp spectrum and the absorption spectra of the different PTI
samples (Figure SI8) as well as the different
electronic properties, resulting from the incorporation of TAP. In
detail, Bhunia et al. performed density functional theory calculations
and showed that TAP doping and the resulting incorporation of carbon
result in a smaller band gap by lowering the absolute potential of
the valence band.23 Nevertheless, the incorporation
of melamine in a certain amount seems to be important as the sample
prepared by 100% of TAP shows a lower degradation rate. For comparison,
melon was prepared by thermally induced polycondensation of melamine
by standard procedures.42 The evaluated
rate of the degradation of MB using melamine-derived melon is 0.4
× 10–3 min–1. It is shown
that PTI exhibits a slightly higher degradation rate compared to melon
and by molecular doping an increase of the rate by a factor of 7 is
achieved. The stability of the catalyst was evaluated for the 75%
TAP sample by the separation of the catalyst and the MB solution after
every circle, subsequent washing with water, and redispersing of the
catalyst in a fresh MB solution. It was shown that the degradation
rate decreases with every recycling step (Figure 4C). After 3 cycles the degradation rate decreases
to 27.5% of the initial value. This decrease cannot be explained by
the loss of catalyst material during the washing procedure and may
result from adsorbed degradation products that block the active sites
of the catalyst. Additional washing steps might improve the recyclability.
In addition, scavenger experiments were conducted to identify the
active species in the degradation process (Figure 4D). tert-Butanol (t-BuOH), para-benzoquinone (BQ), and EDTA–2Na
have been added as scavengers for hydroxyl radicals, superoxide radicals,
and holes, respectively.43,44 The addition of t-BuOH results in a slightly decreased degradation rate,
whereas for BQ for the first hour no degradation of MB but a shift
in the absorption of BQ is observed (Figure SI7). This shift decreases during the 4 h of degradation and the rate
of the degradation of MB increases. We assume that evolving superoxide
radicals react preferentially with BQ. When most of the BQ molecules
have reacted, the MB degradation starts to take place. The observed
rate is similar to the reference without any scavenger molecule. These
results are in accordance to our previous work.36 The addition of EDTA–2Na effects a small decrease
of the degradation rate. Thus, it is concluded that superoxide radicals
are the main active species of the degradation of MB followed by hydroxyl
radicals and holes.

Conclusions
In
summary, we report a facile modification of the electrochemical
synthesis approach recently reported by the authors, which is based
on the formation of radicals during electrolysis of water and the
reaction of those with melamine.36 Just
by partially substituting melamine with TAP in the synthesis, it was
possible to further improve the photocatalytic properties of PTI.
We were able to tune the molar ratio of melamine and TAP from 0 to
100%. With an increasing amount of TAP, the electronic structure of
PTI has been tuned and a decrease of the band gap could be observed.
The smaller band gap results in changes in the optical properties
of the product in regard to a red-shift in the visible region that
can be observed in absorption as well as in PL experiments. This red-shift
enhanced the photocatalytic properties of PTI and in dye degradation
experiments we were able to observe an increase of the degradation
rate by a factor of 4 in relation to the undoped PTI or 7 if compared
to melon prepared by thermally induced polycondensation of melamine.

Experimental
Section
Chemicals
Melamine (99%) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich,
TAP (>97%) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, sodium hydroxide (97%)
was purchased from Grüssing GmbH, hydrochloric acid (37%) was
purchased from VWR, DMSO (99.7%) was purchased from ACROS organics,
MB was purchased from Merck Chemicals GmbH, tert-butanol
(99%) was purchased from Grüssing GmbH, EDTA–2Na (>98.5%)
was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, and BQ was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich
and recrystallized in 2-propanol.

Synthesis of Melon
Melon was synthesized by thermal-induced
polycondensation of melamine. 5 g (39.6 mmol) of melamine was placed
in a semiclosed crucible and heated to 550 °C with a ramp rate
of 5 °C/min. After 2 h at 550 °C, the product was allowed
to cool down naturally, milled into a powder using a mortar and pestle,
washed with 100 mL boiling water, and dried in a vacuum furnace at
60 °C.

Synthesis of PTI
The synthesis is
similar to the synthesis
for PTI that has been recently reported.36 630 mg (5 mmol) of melamine and 800 mg (20 mmol) of sodium hydroxide
were dissolved in 100 mL of demineralized water at room temperature
under vigorous stirring. In a three-electrode set-up with a reference
electrode (Ag/AgCl/KCl), counter electrode (platinum), and working
electrode (platinum), a voltage of 5 V was applied for 90 min at room
temperature under continuous stirring. The distance between the counter
and working electrode was 0.5 cm. The current was in the range of
600 mA. A photograph of the set-up is shown in Figure SI1.

The product was obtained in solution. By
addition of hydrochloric acid, the pH value was adjusted to obtain
a suspension. The product was separated by centrifugation for 5 min
at 7500 rpm (13 206 rcf) and washed twice with 30 mL hot demineralized
water.

TAP was used for molecular doping. The synthesis was
as described
above, but melamine was substituted by 0, 25, 50, 75 and 100 mol %
of TAP. Additionally, the duration of the reaction was changed to
120, 210, 240, 330 and 300 min, respectively.

Photocatalytic Experiments
50 mg of the different catalyst
materials was dispersed in 100 mL of a 10 mg/L MB in water solution
and stirred for 140 min in the dark to set an adsorption/desorption
equilibrium. As a light source, a 300 W xenon lamp (UXL-302-O) combined
with a water filter to avoid heating effects by infrared radiation
was used. Aliquots of 4 mL were taken every 60 min. The aliquots were
centrifuged once at 11 000 rpm (28 408 rcf) in order
to remove the catalyst material. The supernatant was filtered using
a hydrophilic syringe filter (nylon, 0.2 μm pore size).

For recycling experiments, the catalyst was collected after every
cycle and separated from the MB solution by centrifugation at 11 000
rpm (28 408 rcf) for 15 min at a temperature of 5 °C.
The supernatant was discarded. The catalyst was redispersed in 30
mL of water and after the adsorption/desorption equilibrium, it was
set again separated from the solution by centrifugation. This procedure
was repeated twice. The second and third circle of degradation was
conducted as described above.

The reactive species in the degradation
process were identified
by adding tert-butanol (10 vol %), EDTA–2Na
(1 mmol) or BQ (1 mmol) to the experiment.
