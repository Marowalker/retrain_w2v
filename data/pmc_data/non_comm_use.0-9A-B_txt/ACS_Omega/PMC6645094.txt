Silicon
photocathodes coated with drop-casted {Mo3S4}-based polyoxothiometalate assemblies are demonstrated to
be effective for sunlight-driven hydrogen evolution reaction (HER)
in acid conditions. These photocathodes are catalytically more efficient
than that coated with the parent thiomolybdate incorporating an organic
ligand, as supported by a higher onset potential and a lower overvoltage
at 10 mA cm–2. At pH 7.3, the trend is inversed
and the beneficial effect of the polyoxometalate for the HER is not
observed. Moreover, the polyoxothiometalate-modified photocathode
is found to be also more stable under acid conditions and can be operated
at the light-limited catalytic current for more than 40 h. Furthermore,
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and atomic force microscopy measurements
indicate that the cathodic polarization of both photocathodes leads
to the release of a large amount of the deposited material into the
electrolyte solution concomitantly with the formation of mixed valence
species {Mo(IV)3–xMo(III)xO4–nSn}(4–x)+ resulting
from the replacement of S2– sulfido ligands in the
cluster by oxo O2– groups; these combined effects
are shown to be beneficial for the photoelectrocatalysis.

1 Introduction
The
solar production of hydrogen from the photoelectrochemical
reduction of protons has been essentially motivated by the actual
growing need for sustainable sources of high-density energies.1−3 In this thematic area of solar fuels, silicon, with an energy gap
of 1.12 eV,4 is a very promising material
to be used as a photocathode for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER)
because of its abundance, nontoxicity, and its tunable electronic
properties.5,6 This material fails however to promote efficient
multielectron transfers because of slow charge-transfer kinetics.6,7 Consequently, the deposition of pure metals (the archetypal example
is platinum),6,8−10 metal oxides,11,12 or sulfides13−22 onto silicon has been demonstrated to be an effective way to overcome
intrinsic limitations of this semiconducting photocathode material
for HER.23

In that context, silicon
derivatized with molybdenum sulfide-based
complexes, such as molybdenum disulfide and derivatives (MoSx)15,16,18−22 or bioinspired cuboidal molecular clusters incorporating the [Mo3S4]4+ core,13,14 has been explored as a cheap and abundant alternative to Pt and
the resulting photocathodes were found to exhibit high catalytic efficiency
for sunlight-driven HER in acid electrolytes. Interestingly, {Mo3S4}-based clusters offer rich coordination chemistry
able to tune structural, redox, and chemical reactivity, thus giving
the access to a wide range of combinations and properties.24−27 For instance, over the past decade, the development of synthetic
strategies to access hybrid polyoxothiometalates including the {Mo3S4} core within a polyoxometalate (POM) framework
has been engaged.28,29 The novelty of these systems
lies on the combination at the molecular level of an identified active
unit, that is, the {Mo3S4} core with a POM subunit
behaving as electron reservoirs, that is, the POM framework. Because
of their high nuclearity, POMs can undergo multielectron processes,
making them ideal candidates for engineering complex multistep redox
systems (from HER to CO2 reduction).30,31 Moreover, as POMs are highly functionalizable and generally robust
enough to retain their structural integrity during the redox process,
we anticipate that such systems coupled to silicon should provide
effective and robust photocathodes for sunlight-driven HER. Furthermore,
these photocathodes should exhibit enhanced long-term stability compared
with that observed for electrodes integrating uncoupled {Mo3S4} coordination complexes. Indeed, it has been reported
that the latter ones were susceptible to be degraded in the presence
of traces of O2 in the electrolytic solution.13

Herein, silicon photocathodes decorated
with {Mo3S4}-based assemblies incorporating
a polyoxotungstate {AsW12O42} matrix are demonstrated
to be effective for
sunlight-driven HER under acid pH conditions. Such photocathodes showed
a superior catalytic activity and a better robustness compared with
photocathodes modified with {Mo3S4} clusters
bearing an organic ligand such as a butyl-acetylacetonate ligand (noted
acac-Bu, hereafter). Moreover, we here investigate the structural
and chemical changes at these surfaces that occur during cathodic
polarization, which were found to considerably improve the catalytic
activity of the photocathodes as well as their stability.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Characterization of the
Molecular Precursors
2.1.1 Molecular Structure of
[Mo3S4(acac-Bu)3(H2O)3]Cl·H2O
A summary of crystallographic
data is given in Table S1. The single-crystal
X-ray diffraction
analysis of Mo3S4(acac-Bu) revealed the discrete
core {Mo3S4} coordinated to three butyl-acetylacetonate
ligands (acac-Bu) (Figure 1). The coordination of the acac-Bu ligands takes place at
the six equivalent equatorial sites of the Mo centers, whereas three
aquo ligands were found to be attached to the Mo centers at the axial
sites. Geometrical parameters (bond lengths and angle) within the
coordination complex were found usual as those previously reported
for the analogue {Mo3S4}-containing complexes.32 Nevertheless, the acac-Bu derivative of the
triangular cluster {Mo3S4} exhibits a striking
structural feature corresponding to the relative disposition of the
three butyl alkyl chains that run in parallel along the C3 axis of the cluster (Figure 1b). Such structural characteristics allow distinguishing clearly
the hydrophilic polar region, corresponding to the {Mo3S4(H2O)3} part, whereas the three
butyl alkyl chains, arranged as pillars, delimit the hydrophobic domain.
Then, amphiphilic behavior could be expected from such a cationic
assembly which could be easily tuned depending on the length of the
alkyl chains. Such studies are still ongoing progress.

yellow sphere = S; red sphere = O; blue sphere = aquo ligand; black
sphere = C and white sphere = H) showing the hydrophobic part clearly
separated from the hydrophilic domain. (c) Scheme of synthesis applied
for the preparation of the Mo3S4–POM
material resulting from the acidic condensation of tungstate (pH =
2.3) on the trivacant precursor [AsW9O33]9– in the presence of the [Mo3S4(H2O)9]4+ aqua cluster.

2.1.2 Mo3S4–POM Materials
The cationic cluster {Mo3S4}4+ exhibits a high propensity to be incorporated
as a triangular unit
within the polyoxometalate framework. This is an elegant way to associate
covalently the catalytic {Mo3S4} component to
an electron reservoir unit. The {Mo3S4}–POM
material was obtained as a mixed rubidium–sodium salt from
condensation processes of three equivalents of WO42– tungstate ions on the trivacant precursor [AsW9O33]9– anion in the presence
of [Mo3S4(H2O)9]4+ at pH 2.3 (Figure 1c). The resulting solid retains the elemental composition Rb3NaHAsW12Mo3S4(H2O)3O42·14H2O, consistent with
the molecular unit [AsW12Mo3S4(H2O)3O42]5–. The solid,
as well the resulting aqueous solution exhibit a dark-brown color,
featuring the coordination of the {Mo3S4} core
to the oxo group of the POM.29 Thus, the
UV–vis spectrum (Figure S1) showed
the characteristic weak absorption at 600 nm (ε = 520 cm–1 mol–1 L) attributed to d–d
transitions of the MoIV centers. Furthermore, the IR spectrum
of Mo3S4–POM contains the main absorption
related to the polyoxotungstate framework. The vibration band at 950
cm–1 is attributed to the νas(W=O)
mode, whereas those observed at 850 and 798 cm–1 are assigned to bridging νas(W–O–W)
modes.33,34 Analysis of the IR spectrum of Mo3S4–POM appears rather consistent with a saturated
metal–oxo framework with regard to the wavenumber range of
the νas(W–O–W) modes. Vacant POMs give
rise to IR vibrations below 800 cm–1. Such a result
is consistent with the acidic conditions applied for the synthesis
procedure (pH = 2.3) which preclude formation of any lacunary species.
At last, the Mo3S4–POM compound has been
characterized by 183W NMR spectroscopy. The 183W NMR spectrum (Figure S1) shows a complex
pattern consisting of more than 20 183W resonances in the
−100/–200 ppm chemical shift range differing in their
linewidth and relative intensity.35 This
result evidences that the Mo3S4–POM solid
contains a mixture of molecular species which could be isomers or
which could differ slightly by their W/Mo3S4 ratio. Nevertheless, the observed resonances exhibit chemical shifts
fully consistent with WVI centers in octahedral oxo environments.
The cationic exchange process from alkali to tetra-n-hexylammonium salts alters neither the POM composition nor the IR
spectrum (Figure S1).

2.2 Optimization of the Catalyst-Modified Photocathodes
for Sunlight-Driven HER
Before investigating the photoelectrocatalytic
properties of the best-of-class photocathodes, a preliminary electrochemical
study has been carried out to determine the optimal cluster loading
leading to maximum catalytic activity. Toward this goal, three cluster
loadings [namely, 7.2 × 10–6, 3.6 × 10–5, and 7.2 × 10–5 mmol cm–2 of Mo3S4(acac-Bu) or Mo3S4(AsW12)] have been tested for the
deposition by drop-casting of the catalyst films onto Si(100)–H.
The photoelectrochemical response of the freshly modified surfaces
was then examined as a function of the nature and the amount of the
deposited catalyst. As expected, no appreciable reduction current
was measured in the dark for all electrodes. As shown in Figure S2, the first cyclic voltammetry scans
of Mo3S4(acac-Bu)- and Mo3S4(AsW12)-modified Si(100) photocathodes in 1.0 M H2SO4 (pH 0.3) and under simulated sunlight (AM 1.5G,
100 mW cm–2) revealed a broad and irreversible cathodic
prepeak within the range −0.3/–0.1 V versus reversible
hydrogen electrode (RHE), followed by the higher HER photocurrent.
It must be pointed out that this cathodic prepeak was absent in the
following scans and stable sigmoidal photocurrent curves showing 
the catalytic HER wave were usually obtained after two scans for all
tested catalysts and concentrations (Figure 2). The disappearance of such a cathodic prepeak
has been previously observed by Jaramillo et al.36 and Tran et al.37 for [Mo3S4]4+ and [Mo3S13]2– cluster-modified surfaces, respectively. It
is consistent with either the irreversible conversion of the deposited
film into a new material, which is the active form of the catalyst
or the cathodic desorption of the cluster into the electrolytic solution,
as also proposed by Kristensen et al.38 In this work, atomic force microscopy (AFM) and X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS) measurements provide strong experimental evidence
that these two events occurred concomitantly upon the electrochemical
reduction of the modified photocathodes (vide infra). In the first
event, we can thus hypothesize that the reduction of Mo(IV) to Mo(III)
is accompanied by the replacement of S2– sulfido
ligands in the cluster by oxo O2– groups, leading
to the formation of a mixed O/S mixed valence core {Mo(IV)3–xMo(III)xO4–nSn}(4–x)+, as evidenced by post-electrochemistry XPS analysis
(vide infra) and electrochemical measurements of the complexes in
solution at a conventional glassy carbon electrode (Figure S4). For the latter, the observed Mo(IV)/Mo(III) reduction
potential was very close to that previously reported for analogous
[Mo3S4]4+-based clusters.39 At pH 7.3, this cathodic prepeak was either
much less intense for the Mo3S4(acac-Bu)-modified
electrode or no longer observed for the immobilized catalyst Mo3S4(AsW12) (Figure S3).

catalyst-modified p-type Si(100) photocathodes under simulated sunlight
(AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm–2) in 1.0 mol L–1 H2SO4 (a) and 0.1 mol L–1 KCl + 0.5 mol L–1 KHCO3 (b). For comparison,
LSV curves of modified n+-type Si(100) surfaces in the
dark are also shown. The initial cluster loading was 7.2 × 10–5 mmol cm–2 for Mo3S4(acac-Bu) and 7.2 × 10–6 mmol cm–2 for Mo3S4(AsW12).

Considering the stabilized catalytic
response of the photocathodes,
it can be emphasized that surfaces prepared from Mo3S4(acac-Bu) and Mo3S4(AsW12) loadings of 7.2 × 10–5 and 7.2 × 10–6 mmol cm–2, respectively, provided
the highest photocurrent densities combined to lowest onset potentials
(Figure 2). At pH 0.3,
the Mo3S4(AsW12) cluster was found
to be catalytically superior to Mo3S4(acac-Bu)
at low overpotentials (above −0.5 V vs RHE) as the resulting
photocathode showed a higher onset potential (−0.02 V vs RHE
against −0.04 V) and a lower overvoltage at 10 mA cm–2 (0.37 V against 0.45 V, corresponding to 0.18 V against 0.36 V when
the cell resistance was compensated) (Figure S5). For potentials more negative than −0.5 V versus RHE, the
Mo3S4(acac-Bu)-modified photocathode yielded
higher photocurrent densities probably owing to a higher amount of
the deposited catalyst. Compared with Si(100)–H illuminated
under similar conditions, the decrease in the overpotential for HER
measured at 10 mA cm–2 was approximately 700–740
and 560–620 mV (whether Ohmic drop was corrected or not) for
the Mo3S4(AsW12)- and Mo3S4(acac-Bu)-modified photocathodes, respectively.

Focusing on the potential necessary to reach a current density
of 10 mA cm–2 as an electrode activity metric, the iR-corrected value determined for the photocathode modified
with Mo3S4(AsW12) is well in line
with 180–200 mV values reported for highly active (Mo3S13)2–.40−42 MoS2 nanomaterials
deposited on planar substrates (e.g., fluorine-doped tin oxide and
glassy carbon) exhibited a lower activity for HER as these catalysts
achieved 10 mA cm–2 at ∼200–250 mV
overpotentials.40 Not surprisingly, MoS2 deposited on high surface area electrodes (graphene oxide,
carbon fiber paper, and carbon nanotubes) demonstrated excellent activity
characterized by only 110–150 mV overpotential.40,43−46

Moreover, from the difference between the onset potentials
of the
nonphotoactive-modified n+-type Si (Figures 2 and S6) and illuminated
p-type Si electrodes, it can be deduced that the semiconductor produces
a photovoltage of 0.30 V when the deposited catalyst is Mo3S4(AsW12) and 0.27 V when the catalyst is Mo3S4(acac-Bu). Both values are however smaller than
that determined for Si(100)–H (i.e., 0.37 V), as a result of
enhanced recombination of photogenerated charge carriers.

At
pH 7.3, the catalytic performance of the Mo3S4(AsW12)-modified photocathode was found to be lower
than that of the Mo3S4(acac-Bu)-modified photocathode
irrespective of the examined potential range, as supported by a lower
onset potential (−0.18 V against +0.11 V) and a higher overpotential
at 10 mA cm–2 (0.66 V against 0.54 V, corresponding
to 0.44 V against 0.22 V when the cell resistance was compensated)
(Table 1). Moreover,
the difference between the onset potentials of the nonphotoactive-modified
n+-type Si and illuminated p-type Si electrodes yielded
clearly abnormally high photovoltage values, exceeding 0.60 V for
both types of photocathodes. More reasonable values ranging from 0.22
to 0.45 V were determined when n+-type Si electrodes were
replaced by more conventional glassy carbon ones (Figure S7). Such results could be partly explained by differences
in the catalyst–support interactions and/or surface energetics47 of n+- and p-doped silicon at neutral
pH.

2.3 Electrochemistry-Induced Structural Changes
The chemical
composition and the morphology of the as-deposited
and electrochemically reduced cluster films were examined by means
of XPS and AFM. First, XPS measurements have been performed on the
two types of optimized photocathodes to gain insights about the composition
and molecular structure of the as-deposited films and about the nature
of the catalytically active species. With the main carbon C 1s peak
set at 285.0 eV, the characteristic peaks related to the cluster core
are observed.

The freshly prepared Mo3S4(acac-Bu)-modified surface shows the main Mo 3d5/2 and
Mo 3d3/2 lines at 230.3 and 233.4 eV, respectively, which
are consistent with molybdenum in the formal +4 state (Figures 3 and S8).48 Additionally, two minor components
of Mo 3d are observed at 231.9 and 235.1 eV, which can be ascribed
to Mo(IV+) atoms in a different local environment, as previously reported
by Jaramillo et al.36 The presence of sulfur
is evidenced by the S 2s signal at 226.6 eV. The S 2p region shows
a main peak at 162.6 eV corresponding to unresolved contributions
of 2p1/2 and 2p3/2 doublet of S2– ligands. A second minor peak at 164.1 eV is also observed, which
suggests the concomitant presence of S22– groups. Such observations are in perfect line with previous reports
of molybdenum sulfide materials, which incorporate sulfur atoms in
different oxidation states.49,50 The experimental ratio
between the areas under the Mo and S peaks is estimated at 0.75, as
theoretically expected. Moreover, the C 1s spectrum shows a main component
at 285.0 eV and a shoulder at 286.8 eV, which are attributed to C–C
and C=O bonds of the (acac-Bu) ligand, respectively. The corresponding
C–C/C–O peak area ratio of 3.8 was also fully consistent
with the expected atomic composition of the acac-Bu ligand (i.e. 7/2).

XPS spectra of the freshly prepared Mo3S4(acac-Bu)-modified
surface before and after cathodic electrolysis at −0.84 V vs
RHE for 2 h under simulated sunlight (insets). The peaks observed
below 225 eV (highlighted in gray) are attributed to satellite peaks
of the used XPS source. Experimental data and fitting envelopes are
represented by black dotted and continuous lines, respectively. The
colored lines are fitted curves using Gaussian–Lorentzian mixed
peaks corresponding to different components. The initial cluster loading
was 7.2 × 10–5 mmol cm–2.

Now, for the freshly prepared
Mo3S4(AsW12)-modified surface, the
two Mo 3d5/2 peaks attributed
to locally different Mo(4+) atoms are observed at 229.5 and 231.6
eV (Figures 4 and S9). Furthermore, the presence of S2– and S22– groups is also evidenced by
the S 2s and S 2p signals at 226.6 and 161.9 eV, respectively. The
ratio between the peak areas of the total Mo and S signals is 0.74,
as theoretically expected. The W 4f and W 4d lines observed at 35.1
(W 4f7/2), 37.2 (W 4f5/2), 247.3 (W 4d5/2), and 259.9 (W 4d3/2) eV are consistent with W–O/W=O
species involving tungsten in the formal +6 state.51−53 The experimental
ratio Mo 3d5/2/W 4d3/2 is estimated at 0.23,
in close agreement with the theoretical ratio (i.e., 0.25).

and 251.1 eV (indicated by asterisks) are attributed to satellite
peaks of the used XPS source. Experimental data and fitting envelopes
are represented by black dotted and continuous lines, respectively.
The colored lines are fitted curves using Gaussian–Lorentzian
mixed peaks corresponding to different components. The initial cluster
loading was 7.2 × 10–6 mmol cm–2.

After cathodic electrolysis for
2 h with the deposited clusters,
both the intensity and the position of the characteristic XPS signals
were strongly modified. For both photocathodes, a large amount of
the deposited material has been released into the electrolyte solution
during the electrochemical test (about 90 and 70% for Mo3S4(acac-Bu)- and Mo3S4(AsW12)-modified surfaces, respectively), as confirmed by the dramatic
decrease in the intensity of Mo 3d, W 4d, W 4f, and S 2p XPS signals
concomitantly with the appearance of both the Si plasmon loss peak
and Si 2p signal (insets in Figures 3 and 4). Such observations are
in line with those reported for other {Mo3S4}-based cluster-modified surfaces.13,38 As a matter
of fact, the H2 bubbling at the surface of the photocathode
provokes mechanical desorption of a large upper part of the immobilized
layer which does not participate in the catalytic process. Moreover,
the main Mo 3d5/2 and Mo 3d3/2 lines of the
electrochemically reduced Mo3S4(acac-Bu)-modified
surface were shifted to 229.4 and 232.6 eV, respectively, which would
be consistent with partial substitution of S2– sulfido
ligands by O2– oxo groups in the metallic cluster.
Such an assumption is supported by the XPS spectra of [Mo3O4–nSn]4+54 or refers to the presence
of Mo(III+) in the cluster structure.55 The Mo 3d component having the highest energy (assigned to Mo(IV+)
atoms in a different local environment) was not affected by the electrolytic
treatment, both in intensity and position. This leads to the hypothesis
that this component could be the signature of the surface-confined,
stable, and catalytically active clusters. For the cathodically reduced
Mo3S4(AsW12)-modified surface, the
Mo 3d lines of the two components were only 0.3 eV shifted toward
more positive binding energies. Such a result would be rather consistent
with a weaker lability of S2– ligands in the cluster
incorporating the POM. Additionally, the W 4f spectrum shows an additional
component at higher binding energies (37.2 and 39.6 eV for the 4f7/2 and 4f5/2 levels, respectively) that can be
assigned to the formation of some tungstate species.56 Finally, the Si 2p spectrum shows the presence of a substantial
amount of silicon oxides at about 102–103 eV for both cathodically
reduced photocathodes. However, it could not be ruled out that the
oxidation of the silicon surface was either caused by the cathodic
electrolysis or already present after the catalyst deposition because
the Si 2p signal for the freshly prepared photocathodes was totally
attenuated because of the thick catalyst layer.

From XPS data
and using the treatment reported by Cicero et al.,57 if one considers the Si(100) surface atom density
of 6.8 × 1014 atoms cm–2,58 the surface coverages of the catalyst remaining
after cathodic electrolysis can be estimated at (8.0 ± 0.5) ×
1013 and (2.0 ± 0.6) × 1013 cm–2 for the Mo3S4(acac-Bu)- and
Mo3S4(AsW12)-modified photocathodes,
respectively (see the Supporting Information).

Electrochemistry-induced changes derived from XPS were also
corroborated
by the AFM analysis of the optimized photocathodes. After the catalyst
deposition, both surfaces showed a rough and compact granular structure
characterized by the presence of a few hundreds of nanometer large
agglomerates (Figure 5). The root-mean-square (rms) roughness was measured at ca. 6.0 ±
0.5 and 26.0 ± 2 nm for the Mo3S4(acac-Bu)-
and Mo3S4(AsW12)-modified surfaces,
respectively. After cathodic electrolysis, a much less dense array
was observed with the presence of a few tens of nanometer large catalyst
aggregates and the surface of underlying silicon became now visible.
The rms roughness values were therefore considerably decreased and
lower than 1.0 nm for both surfaces. The processing of AFM images
yielded cluster surface density values of (4.7 ± 0.8) ×
1013 and (6.4 ± 0.8) × 1012 cm–2 for the Mo3S4(acac-Bu)- and
Mo3S4(AsW12)-modified surfaces, respectively,
considering the theoretical projected specific area of one cluster
(Figures S10 and S11). Different reasons
can be involved to explain such discrepancies between the cluster
densities extracted from XPS and AFM data, especially for the Mo3S4(AsW12)-modified surface. AFM is believed
to be a less reliable technique than XPS to estimate such a parameter
essentially due to large uncertainties arising from (i) the calculation
method based on the microscale analysis of the surface, (ii) the used
processing method that is based on the detection of a size threshold
to determine the surface area covered by the cluster, and (iii) the
differences between the experimental and theoretical specific areas
occupied by the cluster.

RHE for 2 h under simulated sunlight (b,d). The initial cluster loading
of optimized surfaces was 7.2 × 10–5 mmol cm–2 for Mo3S4(acac-Bu) and 7.2
× 10–6 mmol cm–2 for Mo3S4(AsW12). Scan size: 2 × 2 μm2.

2.4 Faradaic
Efficiency and Turnover Frequency
of the Photocathodes for Solar-Driven HER
The cluster-supported
photoelectrodes exhibiting the best electrocatalytic efficiencies
[namely, those prepared from a cluster loading of 7.2 × 10–5 mmol cm–2 for Mo3S4(acac-Bu) or 7.2 × 10–6 mmol cm–2 for Mo3S4(AsW12)]
were tested for more than 1 h in both electrolytic media under simulated
sunlight. As shown in Figure 6, the photocurrent densities measured during the controlled
potential electrolysis tests were in quite good agreement with those
derived from linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves. Moreover, a careful
examination of all chronoamperometric curves shows a short initial
period (about 5 min) for which the cathodic current increases before
stabilizing. This beneficial effect results probably from the loss
of a large amount of deposited clusters, as supported by the post-electrolysis
XPS and AFM data (vide supra), leading to both a better light collection
and higher conductivity at the solid–liquid interface.

V vs RHE in a pH 0.3 solution (a,b) or −1.04 V vs RHE in a
pH 7.3 solution (c,d) using optimized Mo3S4(acac-Bu)
(a,c) or Mo3S4(AsW12) (b,d)-modified
photocathodes. (Insets) Amount of H2 evolved at the photocathode
as a function of the electrolysis time. The mole number of produced
gas was calculated from the gas volume trapped in a Hoffman cell.
The dotted black lines correspond to the theoretical fit assuming
a 100% Faradaic efficiency. The current fluctuations are caused by
the removal of H2 bubbles from the photocathode surface.
The surface areas of the photoelectrodes are 0.30 (a), 0.50 (b), 0.49
(c), and 0.51 (d) cm2.

At pH 0.3, the photocurrent densities measured for both photoelectrodes
remained relatively stable during the electrolysis time (Figure 6). The amount of
evolved H2 was determined from the gas volume by measuring
the amount of the electrolytic solution displaced in a sealed and
graduated upside-down burette (Hoffman cell).59 H2 was quantitatively produced (Faradaic efficiency of
98 ± 2%) with a rate of 0.48 ± 0.02 mmol cm–2 h–1, irrespective of the nature of the tested
cluster. At pH 7.3, both photocathodes were less stable but the production
rate of H2 was almost unchanged. Noticeably, the Faradaic
efficiency for the photocathode incorporating Mo3S4(AsW12) was higher than that with Mo3S4(acac-Bu), 99 ± 1% against 91 ± 1%.

To quantify the catalytic efficiency of a system, the turnover
frequency (TOF) as a function of the electrode potential has been
determined.40,60 For a HER catalyst, the TOF corresponds
to the ratio of the number of H2 moles produced per second
to the number of moles of catalytically active sites (see the Supporting Information for more details). It
is therefore essential that the contribution of the electrode surface
in the catalytic process is eliminated. Consequently, in this work,
this quantity was determined from iR-corrected LSV
curves of the optimized Mo3S4(acac-Bu)- and
Mo3S4(AsW12)-modified photocathodes
(Figure S5) within a potential window corresponding
to the foot of the catalytic wave,61 that
is, −0.2 to 0.0 V versus RHE (for both clusters at pH 0.3),
−0.1 to 0.1 V versus RHE [for the Mo3S4(acac-Bu) cluster at pH 7.3], or −0.3 to −0.1 V versus
RHE [for the Mo3S4(AsW12) cluster
at pH 7.3]. It is noteworthy that limitations by the mass transport
can be considered as negligible owing to the high concentration of
the electrolyte. Moreover, another critical issue is the determination
of the exact number of the active sites present at the electrode surface
because it is quite obvious that an underestimation of this quantity
will yield an overestimation of the TOF. In this work and according
to previous reports on thiomolybdate-based HER electrocatalysts,13,36 the number of active sites should correspond to the cluster density
remaining after the cathodically induced desorption step and estimated
from two different methods, namely XPS and AFM. Thereby, this is supported
by the stability of both the photocurrents measured at pH 0.3 during
preparative-scale electrolysis for a few tens of hours and by the
LSV response after electrolysis, as shown in the next section. Nevertheless,
for comparison, TOF values calculated using the initial loading of
the deposited cluster are also considered. At pH 0.3, the variation
of TOF with the electrode potential confirms the higher catalytic
activity of the cluster Mo3S4(AsW12) compared to Mo3S4(acac-Bu) (Figure 7). From the post-electrochemistry
cluster density, TOF values in the range 20–80 and 6–14
s–1 were estimated at 0 V versus RHE for the Mo3S4(AsW12) and Mo3S4(acac-Bu) clusters, respectively. Respective values of ca. 850–3300
and 50–120 s–1 were reached at −0.2
V versus RHE. At pH 7.3, the trend was inversed with Mo3S4(acac-Bu) being more active than Mo3S4(AsW12) (Figure 7b). The TOF values fall in the 60–250 s–1 range for Mo3S4(AsW12) at an overpotential of 0.2 V, whereas Mo3S4(acac-Bu) yielded 30–60 s–1 TOF values at
0 V versus RHE.

Figure 7 TOF of the Mo3S4(acac-Bu) (red lines)
and
Mo3S4(AsW12) (blue lines) clusters
deposited on p-type Si(100) surfaces for simulated sunlight-driven
HER at pH 0.3 (a) and 7.3 (b). The minimum (TOFmin, dashed
lines) and maximum (TOFmax, solid lines) TOF numbers were
determined from upper and lower limits of the post-electrolysis cluster
densities, respectively, estimated from XPS and AFM data. TOFload (dotted lines) was calculated from the initial loading
of the deposited cluster.

Such exceptional
values have never been reported for thiomolybdate-based
HER electrocatalysts41,62 so far and exhibit ca. 2–3
orders of magnitude higher than those reported for the most active
molybdenum sulfides, such as MoS2 nanoparticles supported
on Au(111).41,63 Much smaller TOF values [for
instance, ca. 6 and 0.1 s–1 for Mo3S4(AsW12) and Mo3S4(acac-Bu),
respectively, at −0.2 V versus RHE and pH 0.3] competing with
that of the best molybdenum sulfide-based HER catalysts41 are calculated if the number of active cluster
sites is assumed to be equal to the initial loading of the deposited
cluster (Figure 7).
As a matter of fact, a mean TOF between these two extreme limits should
be rather representative of the real catalytic activity of the immobilized
cocatalysts. Importantly, a special care must be taken to the comparison
of our TOF values estimated at a certain overpotential with those
determined for other molybdenum sulfide- or thiomolybdate-based HER
electrocatalysts because all reported TOF values up to date concern
catalysts supported on surfaces other than semiconductors. Additionally,
a few studies devoted to other molecular HER electrocatalysts attached
to p-type semiconductors have reported an order of magnitude lower
TOFs. For instance, metalloporphyrin covalently bound to p-type GaP
yielded a TOF of ca. 4 s–1 at 0 V versus RHE and
pH 7 under identical illumination conditions.64 In another example, a cobalt molecular complex bound to a TiO2-protected GaInP2 photocathode produced H2 with a TOF of 3.4 s–1 at 0 V versus RHE but under
basic conditions (pH 13).65 Besides the
possible underestimation of the density of catalytically active sites,
the high TOF values reported in this work may also be due to a significant
contribution of the silicon surface in the catalytic process even
though special care has been taken to measure accurately the TOF of
the alone immobilized catalyst (restricted potential range in which
the current densities are expected to be controlled by the HER kinetics
and the use of high concentration of the electrolyte).

2.5 Long-Term Stability of the Photocathodes
The stability
criterion is another crucial requirement for modified
photocathodes, mainly driven by the robustness of the interface. To
assess the long-term stability of our photocathodes, controlled potential
electrolyses were carried out in both aqueous solutions over testing
periods exceeding ca. 30 h. At pH 0.3, the Mo3S4(AsW12)-modified photocathode was found to be the most
robust because no noticeable decrease in the photocurrent was observed
after 40 h. In contrast, a 18% decrease in the cathodic photocurrent
was measured for the Mo3S4(acac-Bu)-modified
photocathode (Figure 8). Such a trend features the high stability of the Mo3S4(AsW12) POM material functioning under acidic
conditions. The similarity between the LSV curves before and after
electrolysis supports the excellent stability of the Mo3S4(AsW12)-modified photocathode. At pH 7.3,
in line with short-term stability tests detailed in the previous section,
both photocathodes were found to be much less stable during the potentiostatic
electrolysis with a comparable decrease in the photocurrent after
30 h, namely, 38% against 45%. We believe that the lower stability
and lower activity observed at pH 7.3 for both modified photocathodes
can be ascribed to some decomposition reactions of the immobilized
catalysts and/or a different Si chemical interface. In the case of
the Mo3S4(acac-Bu) catalyst, the first process
may originate from the substitution of the organic ligand by some
anions from the electrolyte, whereas a hydrolytic decomposition leading
to the transformation (such as partial decondensation) of the {Mo3S4–POM} hybrid material is possible in the
case of the second catalyst.31,66 The second process
associated to the electrode may lead to the gradual degradation of
the Si/catalyst interface or could enhance catalyst desorption.67

the surface.

3 Conclusions
In this work, we have demonstrated that a p-type silicon photocathode
coated with a polyoxothiometalate electrocatalyst was catalytically
more efficient than a photocathode coated with the parent thiomolybdate
incorporating an organic ligand for the simulated sunlight-driven
HER under acid pH conditions. These findings were supported by a higher
onset potential and a lower overvoltage at 10 mA cm–2, in spite of a ca. 4–7 times smaller catalyst coverage. Under
such conditions, the polyoxothiometalate-modified photocathode produced
H2 quantitatively with a promising stability along 40 h
controlled potential electrolysis tests. In contrast, the photocurrents
measured at a thiomolybdate-modified surface were gradually ca. 20%
decreased under the same conditions. At neutral pH, the situation
was inversed and the beneficial effect of the POM for the HER was
not observed.

It is anticipated that the catalytic performance
of our electrodes
could be improved by using Si-structured surfaces incorporating an
additional n+ Si layer on the p-type Si surface of the
photocathode structure, as recently proposed for CoP-coated HER photocathodes.68 Moreover, very rich chemistries of POMs and
chalcogenide clusters are also promising directions to improve further
HER activity of this new class of Mo3S4–POM
electrocatalysts.69,70 Finally, because of their high
metal nuclearity, POMs represent relevant molecular systems for multielectron
transfer engineering and then ideal candidates to tackle the challenging
electrocatalytic process of great societal interest, namely, the CO2 reduction.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Reagents
Acetone (MOS electronic
grade, Erbatron from Carlo Erba), anhydrous ethanol (RSE electronic
grade, Erbatron from Carlo Erba), and 3-butylpentane-2,4-dione (Sigma-Aldrich)
were used without further purification. The cationic cluster {Mo3S4}4+ was prepared through a previously
reported procedure71 and available in the
solid state as (NH4)2Mo3S4(H2O)9Cl6·3H2O.
The chemicals used for the cleaning and etching of silicon wafer pieces
(30% H2O2, 96–97% H2SO4 and 50% HF solutions) were of VLSI (H2O2, from Sigma-Aldrich) and MOS (H2SO4 from O-BASF
and HF from Sigma-Aldrich) semiconductor grade.

4.2 Syntheses of the Compounds
4.2.1 [Mo3S4(acac-Bu)3(H2O)3]Cl·H2O
(NH4)2Mo3S4(H2O)9Cl6·3H2O (1.0 g; 1.13 mmol)
was dissolved in methanol (30 mL). 3-Butylpentane-2,4-dione (noted
acac-Bu) (0.695 g; 4.45 mmol) and 2.2 mL of 1 mol L–1 KOH aqueous solution were mixed in 5 mL of methanol and then slowly
added to the greenish {Mo3S4}-containing solution.
The resulting dark-green solution was allowed to stand for crystallization.
After 2 days, well-shaped parallelepipedic crystals suitable for X-ray
diffraction analysis were collected. Yield: 0.66 g (60% vs Mo). 1H NMR (300 MHz, MeOD): δ (ppm) 8.89 (t, 3H), 1.29 (2
× 2H), 2.11 ppm (6H), 2.29 (2H). Anal. Calcd for Mo3S4C29H55O10Cl: Mo, 0.28;

4.2.2 Rb3NaHAsW12Mo3S4(H2O)3O42·14H2O
Sodium tungstate dihydrate
Na2WO4·2H2O (1.11 g; 3.36 mmol)
and Na9AsW9O33·12H2O (3.0 g; 1.12
mmol) were suspended in 30 mL of water and acidified by 3.5 mL of
aqueous solution of 2 mol L–1 hydrochloric acid
until pH was down to about pH = 5. The resulting solution was then
heated at 50 °C while 10 mL of aqueous solution containing (NH4)2Mo3S4(H2O)9Cl6·3H2O (1.0 g; 1.13 mmol) was
slowly added drop by drop under gentle stirring. A cloudy brownish
precipitate was formed and disappeared slowly after 30 min at 50 °C.
The pH of the solution was 2.3. After the solution cooled down to
room temperature, rubidium chloride (1.5 g; 12 mmol) was poured to
the solution provoking the formation of a dark-brown solid. After
30 min under slow stirring, the solid was then collected through filtration
using a glass frit filter, washed with ethanol, and dried using diethyl
ether. Analysis of the resulting solid (2.8 g) was consistent with
Rb3NaHAsW12Mo3S4(H2O)3O42·14H2O, leading
to a yield of about 65%. Anal. Calcd for Rb3NaH35AsW12Mo3S4O59: Rb, 6.5;

and 1/2 constitutional water. IR (cm–1): 950(s),
847(m), 780(vs), 656(w), 445(w).

4.2.3 [(n-C6H13)4N]5AsW12Mo3S4(H2O)3O42
The cationic exchange has been carried out
through liquid–liquid
extraction of the POM as an alkali salt from the aqueous solution
to the toluene organic phase containing tetra-n-hexylammonium
bromide. The 50 mL aqueous solution contained 2.55 mmol L–1 in Rb3NaHAsW12Mo3S4(H2O)3O42·14H2O, whereas
the organic phase corresponded to tetrahexylammonium bromide (0.40
g; 0.92 mmol) dissolved in 40 mL of toluene. Both solutions were contacted
vigorously for 30 min and then decanted within a separatory funnel.
The brownish organic phase was collected. The solvent was removed
through a rotary evaporator until obtaining a dark-brown oily residue
which was thoroughly washed with ethanol and diethylether. Yield:
340 mg (46%). Anal. Calcd for C, 27.7; H, 5.0; N, 0.9. Found: C, 28.3;

with the combustion of five tetra-n-hexylammonium
units. IR (cm–1): 957(s); 850(m); 797(vs); 729(sh).

4.3 Analytical Methods for Characterization of
the Precursors
The NMR spectra were measured in D2O at 27 °C. 1H and 183W NMR spectra were
recorded on a Bruker AVANCE 500 spectrometer at 500.1 and 20.84 MHz,
respectively. According to conventions for standards, chemical shifts
are referenced with respect to TMS and 1 M Na2WO4 aqueous solution for 1H and 183W, respectively.

Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra were recorded on a 6700
FT-IR Nicolet spectrophotometer, using the diamond attenuated total
reflection (ATR) technique. The spectra were recorded on nondiluted
compounds in the range 400–4000 cm–1. ATR
correction was applied.

UV–vis spectra of powdered compounds
have been collected
by using a PerkinElmer LAMBDA 750 spectrophotometer equipped with
a powder sample holder set. The UV–vis spectra of solutions
were recorded on PerkinElmer LAMBDA-750 using a calibrated 0.1 cm
quartz-cell.

Energy-dispersive X-ray spectra were obtained using
a scanning
electron microscope enhanced by a field emission gun equipment (JSM
7001-F, JEOL). The measurements were acquired with a SDD X-Max 50
mm2 detector and the Aztec (Oxford) system working at 15
kV and 10 mm distance. The quantification is realized with the standard
library provided by the constructor using Lα lines.

The
number of water molecules and tetra-n-hexylammonium
cations were determined by TGA with a Mettler Toledo TGA/differential
scanning calorimetry 1, STARe System apparatus or with
a NETZSCH TG 209 F1 device under air flow (50 mL min–1) at a heating rate of 5 °C min–1 up to 800
°C.

4.4 Single-Crystal X-ray Diffraction Study
Intensity data collections were carried out at T = 200(2) K with a Bruker X8 APEX2 charge-coupled device, using the
MoKα wavelength (λ = 0.71073 Å). The crystals were
glued in paratone to prevent any loss of solvent. An empirical absorption
correction was applied using the SADABS program72 based on the method of Blessing.73 The structures were solved by direct methods and refined by full-matrix
least squares using the SHELX-TL package.74 Heavier atoms (Mo) were initially located by direct methods. The
remaining nonhydrogen atoms were located from Fourier differences
and were refined with anisotropic thermal parameters. Positions of
the hydrogen atoms belonging to the organic ligand Acac-Bu were calculated
and refined isotropically using the gliding mode. Data collection,
structure refinement details, and crystallographic data for the single-crystal
X-ray diffraction study of 1 can be found in Table S1
(Supporting Information), including the
CIF file. CCDC 1854697 also contains the supplementary crystallographic
data, which can be obtained free of charge via www.ccdc.cam.ac.uk/data_request/cif.

4.5 Preparation of the Modified Silicon Surfaces
A piece of p-type (1–5 Ω cm resistivity, boron-doped,
250 μm thickness, Siltronix) or n+-type (0.001 Ω
cm resistivity, phosphorus-doped, 250 μm thickness, Siltronix)
Si(100) was sonicated for 10 min successively in acetone, ethanol,
and ultrapure 18.2 MΩ cm water (Veolia Water STI) to degrease
it. It was then cleaned with piranha solution (3:1 v/v concentrated
H2SO4/30% H2O2) for 30
min at 100 °C, followed by copious rinsing with ultrapure water
to eliminate heavy metals and organic residues.

Caution: The concentrated aqueous H2SO4/H2O2 (piranha) solution is highly dangerous, particularly
in contact with organic materials and should be handled extremely
carefully.

For electrochemical measurements, the decontaminated
surface was
further processed to fabricate the photocathode. An Ohmic contact
was established on the backside Si surface with a metal wire by first
scrubbing the surface with sand paper and a diamond glass cutter and
then applying a droplet of InGa eutectic (99.99%, Alfa Aesar). A layer
of silver paste (Electron Microscopy Sciences) was then deposited
on the contact. After drying of the silver paste, the metal wire was
inserted in a glass capillary, and the electrode area (0.20–0.45
cm2) was defined with an epoxy-based resin (LOCTITE 9460,
Henkel) that covered all of the back of the Si surface as well as
the silver paste. The assembled electrode was then placed into an
oven at 90 °C overnight to cure the resin.

The silicon
surface sealed in epoxy was freshly hydrogenated by
immersing the electrode into HF 10% wt (∼5.7 M) for 2 min,
followed by copious rinsing with ultrapure water and drying under
an argon stream.

Caution: Proper precautions must
be used when handling
hydrogen fluoride. Hydrogen fluoride is extremely corrosive for human
tissue, contact resulting in painful, slow-healing burns. Laboratory
work with HF should be conducted only in an efficient hood, with the
operator wearing a full-face shield and protective clothing.

The cluster solution was prepared at 1 mM in methanol (CHROMASOLV,
for high-pressure liquid chromatography, ≥99.9%) by dissolving
[Mo3S4(acac-Bu)3(H2O)3]Cl·H2O or [(n-C6H13)4N]5AsW12Mo3S4(H2O)3O42 followed
by sonication for ca. 15 min. The solution was then diluted with methanol
to reach the final concentration of 0.5 or 0.1 mM. The freshly hydrogenated
Si(100) surface was modified with the Mo3S4(acac-Bu)
or Mo3S4(AsW12) cluster by drop-casting
of the [Mo3S4(acac-Bu)3(H2O)3]Cl·H2O or [(n-C6H13)4N]5AsW12Mo3S4(H2O)3O42 solution
at 0.1, 0.5, or 1 mM in methanol, yielding cluster loading values
of 7.2 × 10–6, 3.6 × 10–5, or 7.2 × 10–5 mmol cm–2, respectively. The modified photocathodes were further used for
electrochemical measurements after evaporation of the solvent at room
temperature for 5–10 min.

4.6 Electrochemical
Measurements
LSV
measurements were performed in a homemade three-neck cell comprising
a quartz window in which were inserted a KCl saturated calomel reference
electrode (SCE) and a glassy carbon counter electrode (the counter
electrode was separated from the rest of the cell by a glass frit).
The cell was filled with the electrolytic solution containing either
1.0 mol L–1 H2SO4 (pH 0.3)
or 0.1 mol L–1 KCl + 0.5 mol L–1 KHCO3 (pH 7.3) and was deaerated by bubbling Ar for at
least 30 min prior to experiments. The photocathode (hydrogen-terminated
p-type Si(100) or freshly covered by the metallic cluster using the
protocol described above) was disposed in front of the quartz window
and used as a working electrode. The light was provided by a solar
simulator with a fluence of 100 mW cm–2 (LS0106,
LOT Quantum Design) equipped with an AM 1.5G filter. Electrochemical
measurements were performed with potentiostat/galvanostat Autolab
PGSTAT 302N (Eco Chemie BV) equipped with the GPES and FRA softwares.
LSV curves were recorded at 20 mV s–1. Unless specified,
all of the LSV curves and the reported potentials were intentionally
not corrected by the Ohmic drop. The Ohmic drop was determined before
each experiment by measuring the impedance of the system at 100 kHz,
and it was found to be around 20–100 Ω depending on the
type of the tested photoelectrode and the used electrolytic medium.
The geometrical areas of the electrodes used for LSV were in the range
0.20–0.45 cm2, and their exact value was measured
using the ImageJ software to calculate the current densities. Potentials
versus SCE was converted into potential versus RHE using the equation: ERHE = ESCE + 0.24
+ 0.059 × pH (that was experimentally verified in our operating
conditions with a bare platinum electrode). The preparative-scale
electrolysis was performed in a Hoffman cell comprising a quartz window
and two closed graduated cylinders above the working electrode and
the counter electrode. The volumes of H2 and O2 gases were measured in situ during the electrolysis; more details
can be found in ref (59). For the determination of the Faradaic yield, the theoretical volume
of produced H2 was calculated using
the electrical charge
used during the electrolysis using the following equation  with Q being the charge passed
during the electrolysis, F being the Faraday constant, R being the gas constant, T being the ambient
temperature, and P being the atmospheric pressure.

4.7 Additional Instrumentation
XPS measurements
were performed with a Mg Kα 1254 eV X-ray source, using a VSW
HA100 photoelectron spectrometer with a hemispherical photoelectron
analyzer, working at an energy pass of 20 eV for survey and resolved
spectra. The experimental resolution was then 1.0 eV. The binding
energy for the main C–C peak has been taken at 285.0 eV as
an internal reference level for all measurements. Spectral analysis
included a Shirley background subtraction and peak separation using
mixed Gaussian–Lorentzian functions.

AFM images were
acquired on a NT-MDT NTEGRA microscope in semicontact mode with FM
tips (resonance frequency around 60 kHz). The images were treated
and analyzed with the open-source Gwyddion software.
