The performance of
a wide-band gap copolymer donor PDTPO-BDTT in
nonfullerene solar cells was investigated. These solar cells presented
broad photoresponse and high short-circuit current density. PDTPO-BDTT:IT-4F
and PDTPO-BDTT:NNFA-4F solar cells with more efficient photoluminescence
quenching and better film morphology gave decent power conversion
efficiencies of 10.96 and 10.04%, respectively, which are much higher
than those of the previously reported PDTPO-BDTT:fullerene solar cells.

Introduction
The past few years
have witnessed the rapid progress of nonfullerene
organic solar cells.1 The state-of-the-art
single-junction and tandem cells based on nonfullerene acceptors (NFAs)
afford 14–17% power conversion efficiencies (PCEs).2 The super advantage of NFAs versus fullerene
acceptors is their strong visible to near-infrared light-harvesting
capability, which greatly enhances the short-circuit current density
(Jsc).3 For
high-performance NFA cells, NFA-compatible donor materials are equally
important. Due to complementary light absorption, the wide-band gap
donors are ideal partners for the low-band gap NFAs. The blend of
a wide-band gap donor and an NFA can harvest a broad range of solar
irradiation and give high PCEs.4 Recent
studies indicate that some wide-band gap donors, which performed not
so well in fullerene cells, inversely show high performance in NFA
cells.5 In this regard, wide-band gap donor
materials, especially those already applied in fullerene cells, deserve
more studies in NFA cells. PDTPO-BDTT is a reported donor–acceptor
(D–A) copolymer donor with a large optical band gap (Egopt) of 1.95 eV (λon = 636 nm).6 It has many advantages, like
nontedious synthesis, deep highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO)
level, and high hole mobility. However, it delivered only 6.84% PCE
in fullerene cells due to low Jsc. In
this work, we investigated the performance of PDTPO-BDTT in NFA cells
by blending it with IT-4F,7 NNFA-4F,8 and COi8DFIC,9 respectively. All PDTPO-BDTT:NFA solar cells
gave broad external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra and high Jsc. PDTPO-BDTT:IT-4F and PDTPO-BDTT:NNFA-4F
cells gave decent PCEs of 10.96 and 10.04%, respectively, much better
than those reported fullerene cells.

Results and Discussion
The structures of PDTPO-BDTT, IT-4F, NNFA-4F, and COi8DFIC are shown in Figure 1. PDTPO-BDTT,6 IT-4F,7 and COi8DFIC9 were synthesized according
to the literature. The synthesis for the unpublished acceptor NNFA-4F
is described in the Supporting Information. The absorption spectra for PDTPO-BDTT, IT-4F, NNFA-4F, and COi8DFIC films are shown in Figure 2a. The donor PDTPO-BDTT shows
intensive absorption at 400–636 nm. The absorption spectra
of the NFAs are complementary with those of PDTPO-BDTT. IT-4F, NNFA-4F,
and COi8DFIC show a strong intramolecular
charge transfer (ICT) band in the long wavelength region, with a peak
at 728, 793, and 830 nm, respectively. The optical band gaps (Egopt) estimated from the absorption
onsets of IT-4F, NNFA-4F, and COi8DFIC
films are 1.54, 1.37, and 1.26 eV, respectively. The band gap shrink
from IT-4F to NNFA-4F to COi8DFIC can
be attributed to the gradually increased electron-donating capability
of the core unit, which strengthened the ICT.10 The energy levels for PDTPO-BDTT, IT-4F, NNFA-4F, and COi8DFIC were evaluated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) (Figure S3 and Table S1).11 The energy level diagram is given in Figure 2b. The HOMO and the lowest unoccupied molecular
orbital (LUMO) energy levels for the donor PDTPO-BDTT are −5.20
and −2.93 eV, respectively. The LUMO levels for all NFAs are
almost the same (∼−3.9 eV), whereas the HOMO levels
are −5.49, −5.29, and −5.26 eV for IT-4F, NNFA-4F,
and COi8DFIC, respectively. The electrochemical
band gaps (Egec) for IT-4F,
NNFA-4F, and COi8DFIC are 1.60, 1.39,
and 1.36 eV, respectively, which are close to their Egopt. The LUMO offsets between PDTPO-BDTT and
the NFAs are ∼1 eV, suggesting sufficient driving force for
electron transfer from the excited donor to the acceptor.12 The HOMO offsets for PDTPO-BDTT:IT-4F, PDTPO-BDTT:NNFA-4F,
and PDTPO-BDTT:COi8DFIC are 0.29, 0.09,
and 0.06 eV, respectively, suggesting that hole transfer from the
excited acceptor to the donor could be less efficient. We studied
the photoluminescence (PL) quenching between PDTPO-BDTT and the NFAs
(Figure 3). Each NFA
quenched over 99% PL of PDTPO-BDTT (Figure 3a,c,e), whereas PDTPO-BDTT quenched 97, 93,
and 47% PL of IT-4F, NNFA-4F, and COi8DFIC,
respectively (Figure 3b,d,f). The inefficient quenching of COi8DFIC’s PL could be due to the smaller HOMO offset (0.06 eV)
between PDTPO-BDTT and COi8DFIC, which
is unfavorable for photocurrent generation in solar cells.

The performance of PDTPO-BDTT in NFA solar cells was investigated
by making solar cells with a structure of indium tin oxide (ITO)/ZnO/PDTPO-BDTT:NFA/MoO3/Ag.13 The D/A ratio, active layer
thickness, additive content, and solvent annealing time were optimized
(Tables S2–S13). J–V curves and external quantum efficiency
(EQE) spectra for the best cells are shown in Figure 4a,b, respectively, and the performance data
are listed in Table 1. The best PDTPO-BDTT:IT-4F, PDTPO-BDTT:NNFA-4F, and PDTPO-BDTT:COi8DFIC solar cells afforded 10.96, 10.04,
and 6.46% PCEs, respectively. With similar LUMO levels, IT-4F, NNFA-4F,
and COi8DFIC solar cells gave similar
open-circuit voltages (Voc) of ∼0.8
V.14 The Jsc for PDTPO-BDTT:IT-4F, PDTPO-BDTT:NNFA-4F, and PDTPO-BDTT:COi8DFIC solar cells are 19.18, 19.30, and 16.96
mA cm–2, respectively, which are much higher than
that of the reported PDTPO-BDTT:PC71BM cells (∼10
mA cm–2).6 This is due
to the broader EQE spectra of NFA cells. As shown in Figure 4b, all NFAs contributed considerable
EQE response at the long wavelength region (λ > 636 nm).
The
maximum EQE (EQEmax) for IT-4F, NNFA-4F, and COi8DFIC cells are 79.6, 71.5, and 57.2%, respectively,
suggesting that charge generation is more efficient in IT-4F and NNFA-4F
cells but less efficient in COi8DFIC cells.
Exciton dissociation probabilities (Pdiss) were evaluated (Figure S4).15Pdiss for IT-4F,
NNFA-4F, and COi8DFIC cells are 95.4,
93.6, and 87.6%, respectively, consistent with EQEmax.
The fill factors (FF) for IT-4F, NNFA-4F, and COi8DFIC cells are 70.4, 62.8, and 46.8%, respectively. Charge
transport and recombination affect FF significantly. We measured hole
and electron mobilities (μh and μe) in PDTPO-BDTT:NFA blend films by using the space charge-limited
current (SCLC) method (Figures S5 and S6, Table S14).16 From IT-4F to NNFA-4F and
COi8DFIC cells, μh increases
whereas μe decreases. The μh/μe is 2.5, 3.3, and 3.8 for IT-4F, NNFA-4F, and COi8DFIC cells, respectively, suggesting that charge
transport is the most balanced in IT-4F cells but the least balanced
in COi8DFIC cells. Balanced charge transport
can enhance FF. We also studied bimolecular recombination by plotting Jsc against light intensity (Plight) (Figure S7).17 The data were fitted to a power law: Jsc ∝ Plightα. The α values for IT-4F, NNFA-4F, and COi8DFIC cells are 0.970, 0.958, and 0.933,
respectively, suggesting that bimolecular recombination increases
in the order of IT-4F, NNFA-4F, and COi8DFIC cells. The increased charge recombination also leads to lower
FFs in NNFA-4F and COi8DFIC cells. The
morphology of the active layers was studied by using atomic force
microscope (AFM) (Figure S8). The root-mean-square
roughnesses for PDTPO-BDTT:IT-4F, PDTPO-BDTT:NNFA-4F, and PDTPO-BDTT:COi8DFIC blend films are 1.25, 1.73, and 0.34
nm, respectively. Compared with PDTPO-BDTT:COi8DFIC film, PDTPO-BDTT:IT-4F and PDTPO-BDTT:NNFA-4F films present
clearer nanofiber structures. The better morphology for PDTPO-BDTT:IT-4F
and PDTPO-BDTT:NNFA-4F films favor exciton dissociation and charge
carrier transport, thus leading to higher Jsc and FF.

densities from EQE spectra for PDTPO-BDTT:IT-4F, PDTPO-BDTT:NNFA-4F,
and PDTPO-BDTT:COi8DFIC cells are 18.93,
18.87, and 16.41 mA cm–2, respectively.

Conclusions
We studied the photovoltaic performance of a wide-band gap polymer
donor PDTPO-BDTT by blending it with three low-band gap NFAs, respectively.
All PDTPO-BDTT:NFA solar cells presented broad EQE spectra and high Jsc. PDTPO-BDTT:IT-4F and PDTPO-BDTT:NNFA-4F
blend films with more efficient PL quenching and better morphology
yielded solar cells giving decent PCEs of 10.96 and 10.04%, respectively,
which are much higher than that of those reported PDTPO-BDTT:fullerene
solar cells. This work suggests that those wide-band gap polymer donors
with poor performance in fullerene solar cells could present high
performance in nonfullerene solar cells. The donor/acceptor partnership
is very crucial in developing high-performance organic solar cells.

Experimental

Inverted Solar Cells
A ZnO precursor solution18 was spin-coated onto ITO glass (4000 rpm for
30 s). The films were annealed at 200 °C in air for 30 min. The
thickness is ∼30 nm. A PDTPO-BDTT:NFA blend in chlorobenzene
(or chloroform) with (or without) DIO additive was spin-coated onto
ZnO. Finally, MoO3 (∼6 nm) and Ag (∼80 nm)
was successively deposited onto the active layer through a shadow
mask (pressure ca. 10–4 Pa). The effective area
is 4 mm2. The active layer thicknesses were measured by
using a KLA Tencor D-120 profilometer. J–V curves were measured by using a Keithley 2400 SourceMeter
and an Enli Tech solar simulator (AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm–2). The light intensity of solar simulator was determined by using
a monocrystalline silicon solar cell (Enli SRC2020, 2 cm × 2
cm) calibrated by NIM. EQE spectra were measured by using an Enli
Tech QE-R3011 measurement system.

for 10 min. The thickness of PEDOT:PSS is ∼30 nm. A PDTPO-BDTT:NFA
blend was spin-coated onto PEDOT:PSS. Finally, MoO3 (∼6
nm) and Al (∼100 nm) were successively deposited onto the active
layer through a shadow mask (pressure ca. 10–4 Pa). J–V curves were measured by using
a Keithley 2400 SourceMeter in the dark.
