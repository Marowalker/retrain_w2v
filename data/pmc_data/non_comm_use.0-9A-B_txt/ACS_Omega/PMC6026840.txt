Hyperpolarized forms of 1-13C-acetates and 1-13C-pyruvates are used as diagnostic
contrast agents for molecular
imaging of many diseases and disorders. Here, we report the synthetic
preparation of 1-13C isotopically enriched and pure from
solvent acetates and pyruvates derivatized with unsaturated ester
moiety. The reported unsaturated precursors can be employed for NMR
hyperpolarization of 1-13C-acetates and 1-13C-pyruvates via parahydrogen-induced polarization (PHIP). In this
PHIP variant, Side arm hydrogenation (SAH) of unsaturated ester moiety
is followed by the polarization transfer from nascent parahydrogen
protons to 13C nucleus via magnetic field cycling procedure
to achieve hyperpolarization of 13C nuclear spins. This
work reports the synthesis of PHIP-SAH precursors: vinyl 1-13C-acetate (55% yield), allyl 1-13C-acetate (70% yield),
propargyl 1-13C-acetate (45% yield), allyl 1-13C-pyruvate (60% yield), and propargyl 1-13C-pyruvate (35%
yield). Feasibility of PHIP-SAH 13C hyperpolarization was
verified by 13C NMR spectroscopy: hyperpolarized allyl
1-13C-pyruvate was produced from propargyl 1-13C-pyruvate with 13C polarization of ∼3.2% in CD3OD and ∼0.7% in D2O. 13C magnetic
resonance imaging is demonstrated with hyperpolarized 1-13C-pyruvate in aqueous medium.

Introduction
NMR hyperpolarization
techniques enhance nuclear spin polarization
by orders of magnitude with corresponding gains in NMR and magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) detection sensitivities.1−6 The produced hyperpolarized (HP) biomolecules can be employed as
molecular contrast agents to probe in vivo metabolism and function.6−12

13C hyperpolarized 1-13C-pyruvate and
its
derivatives are of particular importance because the injection of
HP pyruvate-1-13C and molecular imaging of its metabolic
product HP 1-13C-lactate can report on tumor metabolism,8 tumor grading13 and
response to treatment,14,15 and other applications.16−18 HP 1-13C-pyruvate is now in clinical trials.19

Another similar compound is HP 1-13C-acetate, which
can be useful for probing brain and liver metabolism.20−23 For example, Mishkovsky and co-workers performed in vivo detection
of brain Krebs cycle intermediate by hyperpolarized magnetic resonance
using HP 1-13C-acetate.24 Moreover,
Jensen and co-workers performed a study on tissue-specific short-chain
fatty acid metabolism and slow metabolic recovery in liver using injection
of HP 1-13C-acetate.25

Hyperpolarization of carboxyl 13C nuclei (compared to
proton hyperpolarization) in these molecular frameworks is advantageous
due to significantly longer hyperpolarization lifetime in vivo (by
approximately an order of magnitude) and negligible 13C
in vivo background signal. Moreover, carboxyl 13C (unlike
other carbons in these frameworks) has the largest dispersion of the
isotropic chemical shift, making it a sensitive probe of the structural
and environmental changes.2,6,8

These two HP contrast agents were first hyperpolarized using
dissolution
dynamic nuclear polarization (d-DNP) technique,12,26 which relies on polarization transfer from unpaired electrons at
cryogenic temperatures and high magnetic fields.27

Parahydrogen-induced polarization (PHIP) is an alternative
hyperpolarization
technique.28−31 In PHIP, parahydrogen (pH2) is added in a pairwise manner
(two hydrogen atoms from the same parahydrogen molecule end up in
the same product molecule) to unsaturated precursor compound.28−31 Next, polarization is transferred from nascent parahydrogen protons
to 13C nucleus via spin–spin couplings.10,11,32−36 A number of 13C PHIP-HP contrast agents
have been developed37−39 and validated in vivo over the years.40−52 However, 13C hyperpolarization of pyruvate and acetate
remained challenging due to restricting chemistry of PHIP precursor
molecules until the side arm hydrogenation (SAH) technique was pioneered
by Reineri, Aime, and co-workers.53−55 In PHIP-SAH (Scheme 1), pH2 is added in a pairwise manner to ester moiety.53−59 Next, polarization transfer from nascent parahydrogen protons is
accomplished via magnetic field cycling (MFC) procedure.36 During MFC, the magnetic field is decreased
to nanotesla range first and adiabatically swept to the field above
a few microtesla (typically to the Earth’s magnetic field of
ca. 50 μT because of the practical convenience).10,11,34 As a result, the spin–spin
couplings between nascent parahydrogen protons and 13C
carboxyl nucleus enable efficient hyperpolarization of 13C carboxyl site.10,11,34 Polarization up to 20–50% is theoretically feasible for acetate
and pyruvate molecular frameworks.53,56

Scheme 1 Schematic
Diagram of 13C Hyperpolarization via Parahydrogen-Induced
Polarization (PHIP) via Side Arm Hydrogenation (SAH)
Parahydrogen is added in a pairwise
manner in the first step to the unsaturated ester moiety. In the second
step, the reaction product undergoes the magnetic field cycling (MFC)
procedure when static magnetic field is rapidly reduced to a nanotesla
range first and then the static magnetic field is adiabatically ramped
to a microtesla range (typically the Earth’s magnetic field
of ca. 50 μT for practical convenience).

Preparation of pure HP 13C aqueous solutions of de-esterified
pyruvates and acetates has been demonstrated in the context of PHIP-SAH
(with residual 13C polarization between 3 and 5%,55 which can be additionally improved in the future
through the use of automated high-pressure hyperpolarizers in principle36,50,60,61) for future in vivo and clinical use.

In this work, we provide
a systematic synthetic report for the
preparation of 13C molecular precursors for PHIP-SAH of
pyruvate and acetate with allyl, propargyl, and vinyl moieties (Scheme 2). These moieties
have been shown to be efficient for pairwise hydrogenation reactions
and polarization transfer from nascent parahydrogen-derived protons
to 13C carboxyl nuclei.55 We
anticipate the reported synthetic protocols to be of practical experimental
use for those trying to establish HP imaging programs for in vivo
molecular imaging of cancer, brain and liver metabolism, and other
biomedical studies.

Preparation
Procedure for Vinyl 1-13C-Acetate 7b
To a round-bottom distillation flask (0.5 L) equipped
with a magnetic stir bar, ruthenium(III) chloride hydrate (0.05 equiv,
16.4 mmol, 3.40 g), sodium 1-13C-acetate (0.051 equiv,
16.7 mmol, 1.39 g, 98% isotopic purity), vinyl laurate (4 equiv, 1311
mmol, 341 mL), and 1-13C-acetic acid (98.0 mmol, 20.00
g, 98% isotopic purity) were added. The reaction mixture was stirred
at 35 °C overnight. The flask was attached to a distillation
apparatus: three-way distillation connecting adapter with mercury
thermometer on top, distillation condenser (water), distillation adapter
with vacuum takeoff, and a round-bottom collection flask (25 mL).
The system was put under argon atmosphere by temporarily replacing
the thermometer with a rubber septum penetrated by a needle, which
was connected to the argon gas line. We note that “vacuum takeoff”
is used as gas exhaust during this procedure. After 0.5 h, the thermometer
was quickly returned to its place and the vacuum takeoff was plugged
with the rubber septum. Two needles (one connected to the argon line
and the other one opened to atmosphere) were inserted into the septum.
This setup keeps the system under inert gas, while avoiding pressure
buildup. The collection flask was cooled in ice bath. The distillation
flask was heated to 70 °C for 2 h. Then, the temperature was
gradually increased to 220 °C using an oil bath. After 2 h, distillation
was completed and crude vinyl 1-13C-acetate was washed
with 2 × 20 mL of saturated NaHCO3 solution, with
2 × 20 mL of NaHSO3 solution, and again with 20 mL
of saturated NaHCO3 solution and dried with anhydrous CaCl2. The product was distilled under atmospheric pressure (bp

are provided in the Supporting Information (SI).

Parahydrogen Production
Parahydrogen gas was produced
using custom-built pH2 generator based on cryocooler module
(SunPower, P/N 100490, CryoTel GT). The cryocooler unit was cooled
by a water chiller placed inside the generator chassis. The generator
measures 18 in. (width), 26 in. (depth), and 33.5 in. (height) and
has four casters allowing for relatively easy portability. This cryogen-free
device produces up to 150 standard cubic centimeters per minute (150
sccm) of pH2 at the temperature as low as 42 K and up to
500 psi (34 atm) H2 pressure. For the work presented here,
the generator was operated at 60–63 K, resulting in approximately
66–63% pH2 fraction enrichment.

Preparation
of Solution for 13C PHIP-SAH Hyperpolarization
Commercially available bis(norbornadiene)rhodium(I) tetrafluoroborate
([Rh(NBD)2]BF4, NBD = norbornadiene, Strem 45-0230),
1,4-bis(diphenylphosphino)butane (dppb, Sigma-Aldrich, 98%), and ultrapure
hydrogen (>99.999%) were used as received. The overall scheme of
the
experimental setup is presented in Figure 1. Hydrogen gas was enriched with pH2 to 63–66% para-state using a homemade parahydrogen generator.
pH2 gas flow rate was regulated with a mass flow controller
(SmartTrak 50, Sierra Instruments, Monterey, CA). Hydrogenation reactions
were carried out in 5 mm NMR tubes tightly connected with 1/4 in.
outer diameter poly(tetrafluoroethylene) tubes.

Figure 1 Experimental setup for
PHIP-SAH hyperpolarization and NMR spectroscopic
detection at 9.4 T. The safety valve indicated as ⌀ is set
to 40 or 70 psig in the studies performed.

For hydrogenation in CD3OD, the required amounts
of
[Rh(NBD)2]BF4 and dppb corresponding to 5 mM
concentration and propargyl 1-13C-pyruvate corresponding
to 80 mM concentration were dissolved in CD3OD under argon
atmosphere and mixed using a vortex mixer. Standard Wilmad NMR tubes
were filled with 0.7 mL of resultant solution under argon atmosphere,
preheated up to 40 °C inside the NMR spectrometer, and pressurized
with parahydrogen up to 40 psig. The pH2 was bubbled for
10 s at a 40 standard cubic centimeters per minute (sccm) flow rate
and a 40 psig pressure.

For hydrogenation in D2O,
a previously described procedure32 was
employed for the preparation of aqueous
catalyst solution (∼5.3 mM concentration) in D2O.
Unsaturated PHIP precursor was added resulting in ∼80 mM concentration.
Medium-wall 5 mm NMR tubes (Wilmad glass P/N 503-PS-9) were filled
with 0.5 mL of resultant solution under argon atmosphere, preheated
up to 85 °C in hot water, and pressurized with pH2 up to 70 psig (Figure 1). The pH2 was bubbled for 30 s at a 140 sccm flow rate
and a 70 psig pressure.

After termination of hydrogen bubbling,
the samples were placed
inside the MuMETAL magnetic
shield described in detail in ref (56). The magnetic field inside the shield was adjusted
to ∼0.025 μT using additional solenoid placed inside
the previously degaussed three-layered MuMETAL shield (Magnetic Shield
Corp., Bensenville, IL, P/N ZG-206). This previously calibrated solenoid
was powered by a direct current (DC) power supply (GW-Instek, GPR-30600),
and the DC current was attenuated by a resistor bank (Global Specialties,
RDB-10) to achieve the desired magnetic field inside the MuMETAL shield.
This exact setup with adjustable magnetic field was previously employed
for hyperpolarization experiments using signal amplification by reversible
exchange.63−65 Then, the samples were slowly (∼1 s) pulled
out of the shield and placed inside the probe of 9.4 T Bruker NMR
spectrometer for detection or transferred to the radiofrequency (rf)
coil of a 15.2 T MRI scanner. PHIP NMR spectra were acquired as pseudo-two-dimensional
(2D) sets consisting of 64 1C NMR spectra (acquisition
time, ∼1 s) to avoid delays between placing the sample into
the probe and starting of the acquisition. The acquisition always
started before placing the sample inside the NMR probe, and the first
spectra containing signal were used for presentation here. All NMR
spectra were acquired using 90° rf pulse. The sample transfer
time from the shield to NMR spectrometer was approximately 8 s. The
sample transfer time to MRI scanner was approximately 20 s.

Results
and Discussion
General Considerations
There are
certain requirements
to the structure of the molecule for the hyperpolarization of substrates
by the PHIP method. The substrate must contain an unsaturated (double
C=C or triple C≡C) carbon–carbon bond for subsequent
pH2 pairwise addition. Moreover, isotopic labeling of PHIP
precursors with 13C is required to boost the payload of 13C hyperpolarization from natural abundance of 13C (∼1.1%) to ∼99%.5 Moreover,
the PHIP-SAH approach requires a spin–spin (J) coupling network between the enriched 13C site and the
nascent parahydrogen-derived protons (Scheme 1).10,33,34,36,53 In the context of PHIP-SAH technique and the precursors of interest
studied here (i.e., acetate and pyruvate), carboxyl carbon is enriched
with 13C because it has the longest 13C T1, which is advantageous from the perspective
of biomedical application.5 The network
of spin–spin couplings is established with nascent pH2-derived protons after their pairwise addition into the ester moiety.36,53 The goal of this work is the synthesis of unsaturated esters with 13C-labeled carboxyl sites employing biocompatible carboxylic
acids, such as acetic acids (1a, 1b), pyruvic
acids (2a, 2b), unsaturated allyl alcohol
(3), and propargyl alcohol (4).

Synthesis of
PHIP-SAH Precursors
Acetic acid esters 5a, 5b, and 6a, 6b were
obtained by the reaction of acetic acid 1a or labeled
1-13C-acetic acid 1b with a small excess of
allyl alcohol 3 or propargyl alcohol 4 in
the presence of p-toluenesulfonic acid (Scheme 3). All reactions
were refluxed with the Dean–Stark adapter without any additional
solvent. Approximately 1 equiv of water was collected in the trap
of the Dean–Stark adapter for 4–8 h. Products 5a, 5b, and 6a, 6b were
distilled under atmospheric pressure for final purification with the
yield of 45–75% (Table 1). Although these compounds have been synthesized and characterized
in the unlabeled forms 5a and 6a previously,66,67 the syntheses of these labeled variants 5b and 6b have been reported here for the first time to the best
of our knowledge. We note that the preparation of pure from the solvent
PHIP-SAH precursor compounds is required for PHIP hyperpolarization
because the presence of organic solvent is undesirable for in vivo
studies and prohibitive for future human use.

for 2–4 h (the use of the Dean–Stark apparatus was required
to remove water to prepare pure compounds because water can form azeotrope
mixtures with esters, including those studied here). Products 8a, 8b, and 9a, 9b were
distilled under reduced pressure (30 Torr) for final purification
with the yield of 30–60% (Table 1). Although these compounds have been synthesized in
the unlabeled form 8a and 9a previously,62,68 the syntheses of these labeled variants 8b and 9b have been reported here for the first time to the best
of our knowledge. Moreover, we report the preparation of pure (from
organic solvent) compounds, which is desirable for PHIP-SAH hyperpolarization.
We also note that the overall yields for compounds 9a and 9b were lower than those previously reported for 9a(62) because here neat liquid (vs
solutions) was prepared as the final product. The additional achievement
of the reported work is the synthesis of 13C-labeled compounds
in pure form.

Scheme 4 Synthesis of Allyl and Propargyl Pyruvates
Note: the asterisk symbol denotes
the optional labeling with 13C isotope.

We note that during preparation of this manuscript, Cavallari and
co-workers55 reported on a study of PHIP-SAH,
where they employed 9b (i.e., isotopically enriched propargyl
pyruvate). However, the detailed synthesis of 9b was
not reported in ref (55), instead they stated that they have employed previously published
procedure for the preparation of propargyl 1-13C-lactate
with ∼15% overall yield.54 The procedure
reported here is more than 2-fold efficient with the overall yield
of ∼35% (Table 1). Moreover, to the best of our knowledge, our work provides synthetic
details for the preparation of propargyl 1-13C-pyruvate
for the first time.

The yield difference in case of labeled
versus nonlabeled compounds
is due to a combination of run-to-run reproducibility and purity of
initial 13C reagent. This yield difference is the most
pronounced for compounds 8a and 8b (Table 1).

Synthesis
of vinyl 1-13C-acetate 7b was
described previously from 1-13C-acetic acid 1b and vinyl laurate 11 (Scheme 5).56 We carried
out large-scale synthesis (20 g of 1b) and developed
a method of purification of product. The main impurity was acetaldehyde,
which was removed by washing with an aqueous solution of sodium bisulfate.
The total yield of pure 10b was 55% (Table 1). We note that the procedure
reported here has nearly doubled the yield (55 vs 31% reported previously)
and more than doubled the scale (with nearly 4-fold increase of the
final product).56

Scheme 5 Synthesis of Vinyl
1-13C-Acetate 7b
Note:
the asterisk symbol denotes
the optional labeling with 13C isotope.

The same approach used for the preparation of vinyl acetate has
failed for the synthesis of vinyl pyruvate from pyruvic acid 2a. There was no reaction according to NMR spectra of reaction
mixture even under reflux. Cavallari and co-workers obtained vinyl
lactate using transvinylation by Pd(OAc)2.54 We achieved only 6% (Table 1) of the yield for vinyl pyruvate 10a using
this procedure (Scheme 6) after distillation under reduced pressure. To the best of our knowledge,
this study is the first report of preparation of vinyl pyruvate in
the nonlabeled (i.e., at natural abundance of isotopes) form from
pyruvic acid (although synthesis from other starting material was
reported,69 it is not readily suitable
for 13C enrichment using 1-13C-pyruvic acid
as the source of 13C spin label). We note that vinyl pyruvate
can exist in acetalic form in methanol, which is evident from the
corresponding NMR spectra provided in the SI (the presence of other additional proton NMR peaks about 1–3
ppm and 13C NMR signals of vinyl carbons can likely be
explained by the existence of various conformers of the CH2=CH–O–C=O moiety).

Scheme 6 Synthesis of Vinyl
Pyruvate 10a
Note: the labeling
with 13C isotope was not tested due to significantly lower
yield
(∼6%) and significantly higher cost (10-fold) of 1-13C-pyruvic acid compared to 1-13C-acetic acid (see Table 1 for details).

Feasibility of 13C PHIP-SAH Hyperpolarization
The feasibility of PHIP-SAH hyperpolarization has been demonstrated
for several substrates in the past, including pyruvate moiety in unlabeled
form.36,53−58,70 Here, we demonstrate PHIP-SAH
using 1-13C-enriched pyruvate (the most interesting moiety)
because of its ubiquitous place in metabolic pathways, which are upregulated
in cancer13,14,71,72 and many other diseases and disorders.6,8,17,73,74 We note that isotopic 13C enrichment
is required for in vivo bioimaging applications to provide the additional
sensitivity boost by ∼90-fold compared to the use of nonisotopically
enriched compounds. PHIP-SAH hyperpolarization performed in a 5 mm
NMR tube was analyzed via 13C spectroscopy at 9.4 T (Figures 2 and 3). When the HP product was detected at 9.4 T, the 13C signal was enhanced by ∼4100-fold in CD3OD solution
corresponding to 13C polarization of ∼3.2% (Figure 2b). In case of PHIP-SAH
in aqueous medium, the signal enhancement (SE) and 13C
polarization were approximately 4-fold lower: SE of ∼970 corresponding
to 13C polarization of ∼0.7% (Figure 3b). The SE values were calculated by comparing
HP spectra to thermally polarized spectra (Figures 2c and 3c, respectively). 13C polarization was calculated by multiplying the SE values
by 13C thermal polarization at 25 °C and 9.4 T.

1-13C-pyruvate in CD3OD and (c) the corresponding 13C NMR spectrum of reaction mixture after relaxation of hyperpolarization
(thermal spectrum). Spectrum (b) was acquired with receiver gain (RG)
= 1 due to very high polarization leading to signal overflow at higher
RG values. In CD3OD, signal enhancement (SE) was ∼4100,
corresponding to 13C polarization of ∼3.2%. Note:
the linear receiver gain (RG) was used for spectra acquisition.

Both NMR spectra were acquired with RG = 203. In D2O, signal
enhancement (SE) was ∼970, corresponding to 13C
polarization of ∼0.7%. Note: the linear receiver gain (RG)
was used for spectra acquisition.

The lower 13C polarization values in D2O
versus those in CD3OD are not surprising because hydrogen
solubility in aqueous medium is approximately an order of magnitude
lower than that in methanol.75−79 This fact leads to lower hydrogenation reaction rates and greater
polarization losses during pH2 bubbling step (note: pH2 bubbling was 10 s in case of CD3OD and 30 s in
case of D2O solvent). While the relaxation of nascent pH2-derived protons was not studied here, the previous low-field
relaxation studies in HP ethyl acetate motif (T1 of ∼7.2 s in methanol and ∼4.3 s in water)80 indeed support the hypothesis that a significant
fraction of pH2-derived hyperpolarization decays during
10 s bubbling in methanol. This effect is further exacerbated in water,
where bubbling occurred for 3 times longer period of time and at higher
relaxation rates. We note that polarization losses are not taken into
account for both hyperpolarization approaches in CD3OD
and D2O during ∼8 s long sample transfer procedure.
We also note that optimization of percentage of achieved 13C polarization was not the main goal of this work, although future
studies to improve percentage polarization are certainly warranted.
The use of higher-pressure setups81 and
high-pressure reaction chambers with spray injection50,61,82−84 will likely
increase hydrogenation rates and will effectively lead to significantly
higher polarization levels due to decreased polarization losses. Moreover,
the use of ∼100% pH2 versus ∼66% employed
here would nearly double the 13C polarization values. On
the basis of the previous work of ours50,56 and others,36,5513C polarization levels in excess of 20% may be feasible
using this PHIP-SAH approach, including 1-13C-pyruvate
derivative studied here.

Figures 2a and 3a describe the chemical
conversion during the PHIP-SAH
hyperpolarization process. We note that the reversible addition of
solvent molecule to carbonyl group of allyl 1-13C-pyruvate
leads to the fact that the hydrogenation product is present in the
form of two species manifesting themselves as two HP and thermally
polarized resonances in all 13C spectra shown in Figures 2 and 3.

Feasibility of 13C PHIP-SAH MRI Imaging Using 13C Hyperpolarized Pyruvate
The produced aqueous HP
allyl 1-13C-pyruvate (see above) solution was imaged using
a Bruker 15.2 T small-animal MRI scanner employing 13C
surface rf coil. The HP liquid (aqueous liquid containing 80 mM 13C substrate) was injected into a ∼2.8 mL hollow sphere
via a catheter (simulating future in vivo experimentations), and 2D
projection 13C images were recorded (Figure 4a). The corresponding 13C image
of thermally polarized concentrated sodium 1-13C-acetate
is shown in Figure 4b.

Figure 4 Two-dimensional trueFISP MRI image of aqueous HP allyl 1-13C-pyruvate (a) and thermally polarized sodium 1-13C-acetate
(b) employed for referencing purposes. In (a), the solution is injected
into a partially filled hollow 2.8 mL plastic sphere (rf coil is under
the phantom). In (b), the solution is filled in a 2.8 mL hollow plastic
sphere (rf coil is under the phantom). Imaging parameters: repetition
time = 4.8 ms; echo time = 2.4 ms; total acquisition time = ∼0.3
s; imaging matrix = 64 × 64; field of view = 64 × 64 mm2 (a), 48 × 48 mm2 (b); pixel size = 1 ×
1 mm2 (a), 0.75 × 0.75 mm2 (b). Note: slightly
different imaging parameters for the thermally polarized phantom and
HP material: the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is not corrected for
the different size voxel in these two images. The excitation rf pulse
angle for the surface coil was optimized on thermally polarized 1-13C-acetate sample to maximize SNR.

Both samples for imaging were placed above the rf coil. We
note
that because surface rf coil was used, it had poor penetration in
the sample. As a result, the top part of the sphere imaged in Figure 4b exhibits a significantly
reduced intensity. The maximum signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in HP image
was 33, and the maximum SNR of thermally polarized sample was 91 (note
the different size voxel in the images; the SNR was not corrected
for the difference in the voxel size). We note that the image in Figure 4a visualizes a partially
filled sphere and that the meniscus of the HP liquid is clearly delineated.
The apparent “ghosting” (seen as two overlapping half-circles)
is due to the presence of two HP 13C resonances with nearly
equal signal intensities (Figure 3b). As a result, the MRI image encoding (in 2D trueFISP
(Bruker ParaVision 5.1) sequence) in the frequency domain leads to
an apparent shift (by a few pixels) of these two species in the 13C MRI image in Figure 4a. The corresponding thermal image after the decay of HP state
in Figure 4a was recorded
(data not shown), and it revealed only noise. To the best of our knowledge, Figure 4a is one of the first
reports of 13C MRI image of HP 1-13C-pyruvate
moiety produced via PHIP hyperpolarization technique.

While
d-DNP has reported record levels of 13C polarization
for 1-13C-pyruvate (%P13C ∼
60%85) and 1-13C-acetate (%P13C > 35%86) moieties,
d-DNP is significantly a more instrumentationally demanding technique
requiring cryogenic high-field equipment and a significantly more
costlier technique (∼$106) compared to PHIP hyperpolarization
technique (<$105). The detailed analysis is provided
in a recent review by Hövener and co-workers.5 While only %P13C of ∼3.2%
was demonstrated here for 1-13C-pyruvate moiety in this
report (although Cavallari and co-workers have recently demonstrated
%P13C of ∼5%55), future optimization of PHIP-SAH polarization process
and the use of high-pressure spray injection hyperpolarizer may significantly
increase %P13C to above 20%;36 for example, %P13C of >25%50 was reported for HP 1-13C-succinate using PHIP hyperpolarizer. Values of %P13C above 20% will render the solutions usable
for in vivo use in a manner similar to d-DNP technique,6 but at significantly lower instrumentation and
operation costs and at a significantly shorter production times, i.e.,
∼1 min versus ∼1 h by d-DNP.5

Conclusions
In conclusion, systematic synthetic preparation
of 1-[13C] isotopically enriched acetates and pyruvates
derivatized with
unsaturated ester moiety is reported. Vinyl 1-13C-acetate
(55% yield), allyl 1-13C-acetate (70% yield), propargyl
1-13C-acetate (45% yield), allyl 1-13C-pyruvate
(60% yield), and propargyl 1-13C-pyruvate (35% yield) were
prepared on a comparatively large (multigram) scale. The reported
high yields will be useful for future preparation, in vivo validation,
and clinical trials of molecular imaging employing injectable HP 1-13C-acetate and 1-13C-pyruvate derivatives. The
yield of vinyl pyruvate was significantly lower (6%), and the reported
approach was deemed nonefficient for the preparation of the 1-13C-labeled variant. The synthesized compounds were sufficiently
pure for PHIP-SAH feasibility demonstration: HP allyl 1-13C-pyruvate from propargyl 1-13C-pyruvate with 13C polarization of ∼3.2% in CD3OD and ∼0.7%
in D2O was produced. 13C MRI imaging of HP 1-13C-pyruvate was demonstrated in D2O medium.
