N-Myristoyltransferase (NMT) is a cytosolic monomeric enzyme involved
in the allocation of the myristoyl group to the aminoterminal of glycine
in several viral and eukaryotic cellular proteins. NMT has been validated
as a potential drug target against kinetoplastid for parasitic protozoa.
A multistep virtual screening protocol based on the pharmacophore
modeling, molecular docking, and molecular dynamics simulation was
carried out. Initially, Maybridge database was virtually screened
via a validated pharmacophore model. The effective pharmacophore models
were accompanied with exclusion volumes to improve their receiver
operating characteristic curve to identify potential NMT inhibitors.
The hits identified as actives based on the 3D-pharmacophore model
were evaluated by molecular docking studies. In stepwise screening,
six compounds were shortlisted for the dynamic simulation to get insights
into their binding mode. In conclusion, this study provides fundamental
information about the architecture of the binding site and some crucial
residues that may provide insights into the development of new antiparasitic
agents.

Introduction
Protein modification
is of utmost importance in a cellular dilemma, as it is essential
for signal transduction, protein trafficking, and a variety of other
cellular functions. The fatty acylation of proteins, covalent addition
of fatty acid to the proteins, is one of the essential post-translational
modification. The process primarily mediated by the enzymes N-myristoyltransferase (NMT) and palmitoyl-acyl transferase
(PAT)1,2 is fundamental for a variety of biological
processes, including cell signaling, stabilization of protein–membrane
interactions, and vesicular targeting.2,3

The enzyme
NMT removes initial methionine and facilitates the transfer of myristate
moiety to terminal glycine (Figure S1).
The NMTs appear to be ubiquitous in eukaryotes. Fungi, protozoa, and
insects possess a single NMT, essential for their survival while mammals
possess various NMTs.4 The overall structure
of NMT share isomorphism among the orthologues. The essentiality of
NMT as an antiviral drug target was established as early as 1985.5 However, the highly conserved orthologous nature
of the Myristoyl binding pocket hampered any practical efforts focused
at the development of its inhibitors because of toxicity to humans.
The discovery of specificity in the peptide binding sequence of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and humans can be regarded
as a cornerstone in the development of NMT inhibitors.6−8

NMT has been extensively investigated as a potential drug
target in various parasitic protozoa including Trypanosoma
brucei, Leishmania major, Leishmania donovani, and Plasmodium falciparum.9−12 Myristoylation is conclusive
for growth and cellular proliferation of Eukaryota.13 The essentiality of NMT has also been validated in mammal
dwelling stages of Trypanosoma cruzi, the vector of Chagas disease.14 The
study has also reported constitutive expression of NMT in all of the
stages of T. cruzi life cycle. The
perspective is further supported by studies on Toxoplasma
gondii, demonstrating the adverse effects on virulence
following ablation of a single PAT isoform.15

Several hits to lead optimization campaigns have identified
specific and potent NMT inhibitors. For instance, in 2014, Brand and
fellows have developed a series of brain permeable pyrazole sulphonamide
class of inhibitors against T. Brucei.16 The discovery is based on the optimization
of brain permeability of a previously reported pyrazole sulphonamide
compound DDD646.17 The blood–brain
permeability of the series was further improved by capping the sulphonamide
group and reducing the polar surface area. The most active compound
of series DDD100097 demonstrated partial efficacy in stage II mouse
model of HAT.16 Recent efforts based on
the hybridization of the previously reported series of inhibitors,
resulted in the identification of a novel highly selective series
of tbNMT inhibitors.18 The principal lead
compound of the series, 54, presented higher than 1000-fold
selectivity for T. brucei NMT (IC50 = 5 nM) as compared to human NMT (IC50 = 230
μM). In another hit to lead campaign, the authors have reported
NMT inhibitors with a 40-fold increase in the activity via hybridization
of binding modes of two reported inhibitors.19 The compounds also display modest selectivity against human NMT.
A comprehensive review of reported NMT inhibitors can be found in
the references of Bell, 2015; Zhao & Ma, 2014.20,21

In the present study, we have carried out multistage virtual
screening (VS) to identify novel N-myristoyl inhibitors
as antiprotozoal agents. In this connection, multimodel pharmacophore
modeling was carried out, followed by docking simulation. The obtained
hits were clustered using MACCS-based clustering approach. The shortlisted
hits were subjected to a short production run of 80 ns. The binding
energies of the compounds were extracted from the molecular dynamics
(MD) simulation using MM-GBSA. We further evaluated the druggability
and ADME properties of the compounds to demonstrate the effectiveness
of selected leads.

Results and Discussion
VS has become
an indispensable technique in early-stage drug discovery to identify
bioactive lead against a particular macromolecule target in a cost-effective
and time-efficient manner.22 VS filters
out hundreds and thousands of nonbinders from the available chemical
space, reducing the cost associated with the synthesis and bioscreening.
In the present study, we aim to implement VS strategies to identify
novel NMT inhibitors. In this connection, multistage VS was carried
out to identify potential leads from Maybridge database.

Multimodel
Pharmacophore Modeling
The prime objective of the pharmacophore
modeling process is to develop an “abstract of chemical features”
to identify as many active compounds from the dataset of active and
as few inactive from the reported inactive as possible. Further, the
model should be able to differentiate between the active and inactive
compounds with modest accuracy.

The quality of a structure-based
pharmacophore model highly depends on the fidelity of the crystal
structure and accuracy of the annotation scheme used for the recognition
of molecular features.23,24 In the present study, we used
the “unified” annotation scheme implemented in MOE to
develop pharmacophore models.

At the time of writing (December
2018), PDB holds evidence for L. major NMT (lmNMT) crystal structures with cognate ligands belonging to
nine different classes (Table S1). Brannigan
et al. have reported significant diversity in the binding of lmNMT
with selective ligands, belonging to four different chemically distinct
scaffolds.25 During a hit expansion campaign,
Spinks and group have pointed out that the thiazolidinone derivatives
adopt two binding modes with lmNMT.26 Moreover,
the observed binding modes also differ from the previously reported
binding modes. Taken together, the evidence suggests that a single
receptor cannot entail the diversity in the binding pattern of the
reported lmNMT inhibitors.

To overcome this difficulty, we have
developed pharmacophore models using 12 different crystal structures
(Table S1). For each complex, a structure-based
pharmacophore hypothesis was generated in the pharmacophore module
in MOE. The initially developed hypotheses were refined to optimize
predictive performance. Initially, the active and inactive datasets
were screened, and the feature itself or its size was altered to include
the active selectively and exclude inactive compounds. The features
defining the interactions with key residues such as Phe90, Tyr217,
Ser330, and Asn396 were retained.

In the next step, exclusion
volumes were added to remove the inactive compounds that sterically
clash with the protein. Furthermore, when required the occupied volumes
were also added to confer specificity. The models were further evaluated
with an aim to select the best models for VS. Among the generated
pharmacophore models, the models with optimum performance in the theoretical
validations were employed for searching NMT inhibitors. Table 1 presents the results of various
statistical metrics calculated in this regard.

The specificity evaluates
the ability of a binary classifier to differentiate between the members
of active and inactive datasets. In our case, all of the models were
found to be highly specific (0.9–1). The sensitivity of a model
depicts the percentage of active compounds retrieved by the model
from the active database. As mentioned in the Table 1, the pharmacophore models, 2–5, 7,
and 9–10 presented decent sensitivity values (0.41–0.53).
In a binary classification system, there exists a compromise between
the sensitivity and specificity.27 Therefore,
a specific pharmacophore is not expected to retrieve all of the members
of the active dataset.

The precision value describes the ability
of a pharmacophore model to fetch true positive and to reject false
positive outcome. A precision score closer to 1 depicts the bias towards
the actual positive outcomes. A higher precision: negative predictive
value (NPV) ratio pronounces the ability of the model to identify
a positive compound accurately and to reject specific negative instance.
In conclusion, all of the developed pharmacophores present significant
bias toward the members of the active dataset. However, for VS the
most restrictive models with nonoverlapping hit spectra were selected.
As demonstrated earlier, using a combination of multiple restrictive
models representing different binding modes rather than a single broad
model restricts the retrieval of false positive hits.28

The hits obtained from all of the models were mapped
to evaluate the hit spectra. In case of models with overlapping hit
spectra, only the most restrictive model was retained. As a result,
three pharmacophore models 2, 4, and 10 (PDB IDs; 4A2Z, 4A31, and 5AG6) were selected for
VS of Maybridge database. The finally selected models were able to
identify all of the active compounds. Altogether, the three models
recognized three inactives out of 30 compounds in the dataset. Further,
each of the finally selected pharmacophore models had a decoy hit-rate
of less than 5%, which pronounce the specificity of our models. Herein,
we will restrict our discussion to the finally selected pharmacophore
models.

The pharmacophore model 2 was developed using the protein–ligand
interaction pattern of PDB 4A2Z. The finally selected pharmacophore model consisted
of four features: two aromatic, a donor, and an acceptor (Figure 1a,b). The fundamental
pharmacophore interactions of the finally selected pharmacophore included
interactions with Phe88 and Phe90 and Tyr217 as well as two hydrogen
bonds with Ser330 and Asn376. The addition of another feature atom-Q
at the sulfur atom of the sulfonamide moiety enhanced the specificity
of the model, resulting in a more restricted model. Further, both
occluded and exclusion volumes were added to improve the quality of
the model.

Figure 1 Finally selected structure-based pharmacophore models 2, 5, and
10 based on the crystal structures of lmNMT; PDB IDs 4A2Z, 4A31, and 5AG6, respectively. Panel
(a) depicts the features of pharmacophore model based on 4A2Z (model 2). The features
of 4A31 and 5AG6 (model 4 and 10)
are depicted in subfigures (c,e). In the right panels, subfigures
(b,d,f) show the flattened structure of cognate inhibitor and limited
definition of the surrounding residues. The khaki spheres show hydrophobic
or aromatic, blue, and magenta spheres depicts hydrogen bond donor
and acceptor, respectively. The gray sphere exhibit exclusion volumes,
while translucent red dotted spheres in figure (a) exhibit the occupied
volumes. The magenta dashed lines in (a,c,e) depict hydrogen bonds.
The water-mediated bridges are presented as blue dashes.

Model 4 consisted of six features with partial match enabled
for one feature. The selected acceptor and donor features mapped to
hydrogen bonding interaction with Ser330, Asn376, and a water-mediated
bridge with Tyr80 (Figure 1c,d). The two aromatic features depict π-stacking interaction
with the aromatic amino acids in serine and peptide binding pockets.
The pharmacophore model retrieved 32 active compounds and 2 inactive
compounds.

The pharmacophore model 10 consisted of four features
complementary to the architecture of the binding site. An aromatic
feature depicts the interaction of inhibitor with Phe232 and Tyr217.
The model also contains two hydrogen bond features depicting interactions
with Asn376 and Asp396 (Figure 1e,f).

A comparative overview of interaction profiles
of cognate ligands in case of pharmacophore models 2, 4, and 10 is
tabulated as Table 2. The nitrogen atom of the pyrazole ring in case of models 2 and
4 and oxygen substitution at the thiazole ring of thiazolidinone in
model 10 mediate hydrogen bonding interaction with Ser330. Similarly,
all of the three models mediate hydrogen bond with Asn376. In model
2, the ligand mediated multiple interactions with Tyr217, including
hydrogen bond, while the other models emphasize on the hydrophobic
interactions with Tyr217. In model 10, multiple interactions were
observed between the ligand and Phe88, whereas the other two ligands
do not interact with Phe88. Thus, the three models provide a slightly
different definition of the active site, which might incorporate diversity
in the obtained virtual hits (VHs). To further investigate the binding
mode of the obtained VHs, molecular docking simulations were carried
out. Figure 2 provides
a sequential summary of the multistep VS carried out in the present
study.

Molecular Docking
The binding modes of compounds screened
by pharmacophore were developed using molecular docking studies. Molecular
docking is a fast and reliable method for large-scale drug screening.
The accuracy of a docking program to be used in a particular VS campaign
can be evaluated in two ways. First, the software should be able to
reproduce the near-native; that is, the experimentally determined
pose and secondly the scoring function should be able to differentiate
between the active and inactive compounds. To evaluate the accuracy
of docking software and to establish the binding mode of novel VHs,
benchmarking studies were carried out. The experiments revealed that
the top-ranked poses generated by Vina were similar to the native
binding mode (Figure S2). Further experiments
with multiple receptors indicate that Vina in combination with at
least three different structures, 2WSA, 4A2Z, and 4A31, was able to score active and inactive
compounds differently. In the case of PDB: 2WSA, the ROC lies in the left upper quadrant
of the graph pronouncing the high specificity of the protocol (Figure 3). The observation
is further supported by the AUC value closer to 1 (0.98). In the light
of the above experiments, the binding modes of the shortlisted hits
were established using Vina and PDB: 2WSA as a receptor.

Figure 3 Results of score-based
ranking experiments carried out using Vina and crystal structures
of NMT; mentioned below as four-letter PDB codes. The data consisted
of the members of active and inactive datasets. The AUC values and ROC curves were obtained using ROCR function in R
(Sing et al. 2005; R Development Core Team 2008). The higher AUC values
in case of 2WSA, 4A2Z, and 4A31 depict a good binary
classifier.

The VHs screened during the pharmacophore
screening were subjected to molecular docking studies. The top-ranked
pose of the shortlisted VHs was extracted using an in-house script,
and the hits with scores higher than −7.7 kcal/mol were included
in the further calculations. The selection cut off was based on the
results of the score-based ranking experiments carried out earlier.

The compounds were further clustered according to the nature of
the core structure, using the MACCS structural keys fingerprinting
approach implemented in SAR report utility in MOE. As a result, 13
large clusters were obtained (Figure 4). A cursory look at Figure 4 shows that our pharmacophore models were
able to identify diverse chemotypes, pronouncing the scaffold hopping
ability of selected pharmacophores. The selected hits were subjected
to protein–ligand interaction fingerprinting (PLIF) implemented
in MOE. The interaction pattern of each VH was analyzed. Based on
the interaction with hotspot residues, 12 hits were shortlisted. The
chemical structures of the selected 12 compounds are presented in Figure 5. The IUPAC names,
three-dimensional coordinates, and docking scores are present in the Supporting Information; Table S2 and S2.zip.

VS against NMT along with their Maybridge product codes.

Analysis of the Binding Mode
The binding mode of selected
hits was established using Vina. Figure 6a depicts the simulated binding pose of the
compound HTS05346. The methyl groups at the terminal benzene ring
exhibit a “methyl effect”. However, Tyr217 is stacked
against benzene ring, exhibiting face-to-face interaction. The oxygen
of isoxazole ring demonstrates a hydrogen bond with a backbone amide
group of His398. The protein–ligand contacts are further stabilized
by apolar interaction between the ligand and Glu82.

Figure 6 Binding poses of VHs:
HTS05346, SPB03259, CD09798, HTS11181, SPB08283, and HTS05445 depicted
in panels (a–f) in alphabetical order. The protein residues
are depicted as thick gray sticks (carbon atoms colored in light grey).
For the clarity of the picture, only residues interacting with ligand
were included in the graphic. The dashed green line depicts hydrogen
bonding interaction. Images were rendered using UCSF Chimera.

In case of compound SPB03259, the chlorobenzene
ring exhibits a parallel π-stacking interaction with the aromatic
ring of Tyr 217, as well as a hydrogen bond (distance 2.97 Å).
However, the terminal isoxazole ring captures the hydroxyl group of
Tyr80 (Figure 6b).
The chlorobenzene moiety of CD09798 interacts with Tyr217, with additional
contact mediated by hydrogen bond interaction via a side chain hydroxyl
group. The nitrogen atoms in the pyrazole ring of the ligand demonstrate
a hydrogen bond with Thr203 and a water bridge with Asn167 (Figure 6c).

The compound
HTS11181 exhibit hydrogen bond with the backbone amide of His398 (Figure 6d). Another hydrogen
bond is observed between the ligand and Glu82. Further anchorage is
provided by face-to-face interaction between the ligand and Tyr217.
In case of SPB08284, the heteroatoms (oxygen and nitrogen) of 5-methylisoxazole
demonstrate hydrogen bonding interaction with backbone amide groups
of the Asn396 and Gly397 (Figure 6e).

Figure 6f presents the top-ranked simulated pose of compound HTS05445. As evident from figure, the edges of the benzene
ring of the ligand exhibits weak interactions with Tyr217. The chlorobenzene
ring in ligand delves deeper into the ligand binding site, producing
a “hydrophobic effect” which in the absence of polar
interactions act as a compensatory stabilizing factor. The compound
also exhibits hydrogen bonds with Asp83 and Asn376.

Figure 7a presents the binding
mode of compound AW00765. The compound exhibits hydrophobic contacts
with Val81 and Phe90. The methyl group at the nicotinic acid establishes
a hydrophobic contact with edge of Tyr217. There is an apparent dearth
of hydrogen bonding with the ligand mediating hydrogen bond interaction
with only Asp83.

Figure 7 Binding poses of VHs: AW00765, SPB03712, HTS11453, RH06193,
BTB05308, and KM04091 depicted in panels (a–f) in alphabetical
order. The protein residues are depicted as thick gray sticks (carbon
atoms coloured in light grey). For the clarity of picture, only residues
interacting with ligand were included in the graphic. The dashed green
line depicts hydrogen bonding interaction. Images were rendered using
UCSF Chimera.

The compound SPB03712 mediates
hydrophobic contacts with Phe90, Leu341, Ala343, and Leu399. The thiazole
ring of compound is sandwiched between Tyr217 and Phe232. Apart from
hydrogen bonding interaction with Asn376, the chloride moiety is involved
in halogen bonding interaction with Asn167 (Figure 7b). The plausible binding mode of compound
HTS11453 is depicted in Figure 7c. The dichlorobenzene moiety of the ligand exhibits parallel
π-stacking interaction with Tyr217. One of the chloride substitutions
mediates a halogen bond with Tyr345 side chain hydroxyl group. The
backbone amide of Asp396 interacts with oxygen substitution at the
purine ring.

The compound RH06193 resides comfortably in the
binding site extending hydrophobic interactions with Val81, Phe90,
and Tyr345 and hydrogen bond with Asn376 (3.4 Å). The aromatic
ring of the Tyr217 mediates face-to-face stacking interaction against
the benzene ring of ligand (Figure 7d). The analysis of the top-ranked binding mode of
the compound BTB05308 highlights hydrophobic contacts as the most
dominant interaction between the ligand and protein. As evident from
the Figure 7e, the
ligand presents hydrophobic contacts with Val81, Phe88, Phe90, Leu341,
and Leu399. The aromatic rings of the Phe90 and Tyr217 are positioned
perpendicular to the ligand, reinforcing a T-shaped π-stacking
interaction. The polar atoms of the ligand mediated hydrogen bonds
with the side chains of the Tyr80 and Asn376. Moreover, a water-mediated
bridge connects the ligand with Asn167.

Figure 7f depicts the binding mode of compound KM04091.
The compound also exhibits hydrophobic contacts with the Val81, Phe88,
Phe90, and Phe232. An essential feature of the ligand is water-mediated
interaction with Gly397. The ligand 646 mediates similar interaction
with Asn396 (PDB: 2WSA). Nonetheless, the compound 646 exhibits water-mediated interaction
with Gly205 via a different moiety. The simulated binding pose of
KM04091 demonstrates a direct hydrogen bond between Gly205 and ligand.
The observation highlights the scaffold hopping ability of our protocol.

ADME-ToX Prediction
The selected hits were subjected to
ADME-ToX prediction using the QikProp module in Schrödinger.
The molecular weights and volumes of all of the 12 compounds were
found to comply with the ranges established using the 95% of the reported
drugs (Tables 3 and S3). All of the compounds were found to observe
the Lipinski rule of five of drug likeliness29 with zero violations, except for SPB08284 which was found to violate
one of the filters. As presented in Table 3 most of the compounds were also in accord
with the Jorgensen rule of three. All of the compounds were predicted
to have moderate to low blood brain barrier permeability with high
oral absorption rate except SPB03712. The observation is further supported
by the good Caco-2 permeability of the selected compounds. Caco-2
is often employed as an in vitro model of human intestinal mucosa
for prediction of the oral bioavailability of a drug.30

MD Simulation
In order to understand the dynamic behavior
of ligands, a short production run of selected hits was carried out
using AMBER. The protein–ligand complex was solvated and equilibrated,
followed by the production run. The MD simulation provided insights
into the overall stability of system. The quality of the simulation
was evaluated by analyzing the root mean square deviation (RMSD),
radius of gyration (RoG), and root mean square fluctuation (RMSF).

RMSD serves as a key factor to describe the stability of a system
undergoing MD simulation. The internal motion of protein backbone
atoms is analyzed to investigate the stability of the system throughout
simulation. The RMSD of the main chain heavy atoms of system of protein
was obtained using the “rms” command in CPPTRAJ. Figure 8 depicts the RMSD
deviation of heavy atoms of protein backbone. The assembly was not
fully equilibrated until 10 ns into the production run (as determined
by the protein RMSD); therefore, only the remaining 70 ns was considered
for following calculations.

Figure 8 RMSD of the systems calculated as a function
of time.

As evident from Figure 8, all of the systems displayed
variable deviations with an average RMSD value of 2.5 Å. All
of the systems presented stable internal motion. The observation was
further supported by analysis of RoG, which suggests that all of the
systems were well-converged (Figure S3).
The residue contact information was retrieved to observe the immediate
environment of each ligand. To assess the dynamics of side chains
of residues, RMSF of the protein residues was calculated as a function
of time. The data indicate that the amino acid residues in all of
the protein–ligand complexes were fairly stable when compared
to the apo protein (Figure 9).

Figure 9 RMSF of the protein residues calculated as a function of time.

The visual analysis of trajectories suggests that
HTS11453 mediates hydrophobic and π-stacking interaction with Tyr217 and His219. Further, methyl substitutions
at the pyrazole ring are near Phe88, Phe90, and Phe232 which validate the previously hypothesized
methyl effect. Moreover, the other methyl group extends weak interactions
with aliphatic side chains of Leu341, Ala343, and Val374 (Figure S4).
Taken together, these pieces of evidence suggest the critical role
of methyl groups in lowering the solvation energy. During simulation,
the benzene ring of ligand was found to be sandwiched between the
Tyr217, aromatic group and His219 (imidazole) consistent with the
docking pose.

The analysis of time-dependent trajectories of SPB08284 demonstrated some interesting results. The polar
atoms of the isoxazole moiety remained in contact with the receptor
via polar interaction with Gly397 and Asp396. The minimum distance between isoxazole polar atoms and amide groups
of interacting residues is depicted in Figure S4. Another interesting observation was found in case of the
1,2-dimethoxybenzene moiety. After 16 ns into the production (8 ns
of the reported production run used for the analysis), ring rotates
(approx. 10°) to expose the other methoxy group to Ser330. However, the minimum distance between the Ser330 hydroxyl group
and ligand remained the same.

During simulation, the benzene
ring of compound AW00765 penetrated more in-depth into
the binding side extending interaction with Val81, Tyr217, Tyr345,
and Leu399. It has been reported that these aromatic–aliphatic
interactions are amongst the most commonly occurring interactions
at the nonpolar interfaces.31 After the
removal of the first restraint, fluorine atoms were reoriented such
that one of the fluorine atoms remained in contact with the amide
backbone of Gly205 (Figure S4). Of particular importance is the role of Tyr217 in the stability
of compound. The side chain hydroxyl group of Tyr217 maintained polar
contact with ligand supporting the hydrophobic contact between ligand
and its aromatic ring.

Binding Free Energy
The MM(GB/PB)SA
free-energy contributions were calculated to get insights into the
forces involved in protein–ligand binding. To evaluate the
binding ability of all three complexes, 100 conformations were extracted
from last 10 ns of MD trajectories with 0.1 ns time interval. Table 4 enlists the contribution of individual
energetic components to the binding of the inhibitor. The calculated
binding free energies (ΔGb) of HTS11181,
SPB08284, and AW00765 complexes with NMT are −51.16, −38.99,
and −63.82 kcal mol–1, respectively. The
data indicate that the intermolecular van der Waals interactions (ΔEint vdW) contribute significantly to the
binding free energies. However, the electrostatic interaction energies
(ΔGele) were positive in case of
complex AW00765 and the data indicate favorable contributions to the
binding free energies, which are in good agreement with MD result
(electrostatic interaction of ligand with Gly205 perturbs after 40
ns; showed in md graphs). Further, the nonpolar salvation terms, corresponding
to the burial SASA upon inhibitor binding, contribute slightly favorably.
However, the total binding affinity arises from a more complex interplay
between all these components.

Conclusions
Myristoylation,
a post-translational modification process, is essential for the growth
and survival of protozoa. In the present study, we have carried out
multistage VS to identify novel NMT inhibitors as antiprotozoal agents.
In this connection, multimodel pharmacophore screening was carried
out using the available crystal structures. The subsequent optimization
and statistical evaluation highlight the ability of generated hypotheses
to identify chemical entities with reliable sensitivity and specificity
(Table 1 and Figure 1). The compounds
screened from the pharmacophore-based VS were subjected to docking
simulation for binding mode analysis. The benchmarking results suggest
that the global search and scoring functions of AutoDock Vina were
able to reproduce the experimental pose and differentiate between
the active and inactive compounds. The analysis of molecular docking
and subsequent analysis identified 12 significant hits (Figure 5). Finally, selected compounds
from the obtained hits were subjected to a short production run of
80 ns. The analysis of the quality metrics suggests that all of the
systems remain stable throughout simulation (Figures 8 and 9).

Methodology
Protein
Preparation
The crystal structures of the lmNMT bound to
different classes of inhibitors with high resolution (<3 Å)
were retrieved from the RCSB Protein Data Bank (Table S1).32 The structures were
prepared using the protein preparation wizard in MOE v. 2016.0801
[Molecular Operating Environment (MOE), 2016.08; Chemical Computing
Group Inc., 1010 Sherbrooke St. West, Suite #910, Montreal, QC, Canada,
H3A 2R7, 2016].

During preparation, the structures were subjected
to addition of missing atoms and residues, bond order, formal charge
correction, and tautomer adjustment. Hydrogens were added using the
protonate 3D algorithm. For protonation, generalized Born volume integral33 (GB/VI) was used as the electrostatics function,
with a dielectric value of 80 (for solvent). The van der Waals and
electrostatics cut off were set as 15 and 10 Å, respectively.
Partial charges were applied using AMBER10:EHT force field34,35 implemented in a MOE software suite. The water molecules involved
in bridging ligand and protein were retained, which were kept rigid
during energy minimization.

Pharmacophore Modeling
Pharmacophore
modeling is a sophisticated computational chemistry method used for
the elucidation of intermolecular interactions stabilizing the protein–inhibitor
complexes.36 Pharmacophore-based screening
allows rapid screening of millions of compounds, without compromising
the overall accuracy. We used the unified annotation scheme for pharmacophore
modeling implemented in MOE, as it is the most comprehensive annotation
scheme. A series of different pharmacophore models were developed
using structures mentioned in Table S1.
Each pharmacophore model was refined to increase its specificity by
manipulating the exclusion volumes. The partial matches were also
allowed in some instances to improve the quality of model.

Data Set
Preparation
In order to evaluate the selectivity of developed
protocol, a data set of structurally diverse compounds with potent
NMT activity was manually curated. Similarly, a data set of inactive
compounds was also created using structurally similar inactive compounds.
To access the efficiency of generated pharmacophore hypotheses, we
developed a decoy library using DUD-E web server.37

For each active ligand, 50 decoys with similar physical
properties but different topological characteristics were created.
The inclusion of the decoy data set further challenges the specificity
of the hypothesis. The prime objective behind using the decoy data
set is to avoid the artificial enrichment.37 The decoys were prepared according to the protocol established earlier.38

For VS, Maybridge Screening Collection
was downloaded from the Maybridge website (https://www.maybridge.com).
As of December, 2018, Maybridge screening collection consisted of
52 066 compounds. All of the compounds were charged using the
MMFF94x force field implemented in MOE, allowing the adjustment of
hydrogens and lone pairs, when required. The database was subjected
to energy minimization using default RMS gradient of 0.1 kcal/mol/Å2. Following protonation and minimization, the compounds were
saved in the MOE database format.

Theoretical Validation
For theoretical validation, the developed pharmacophore models
were subjected to three different subsets; active, inactive, and decoys.
A modest pharmacophore should be able to differentiate between the
active and inactive data set, identify the members of active data
set, and reject the subset of inactive compounds. In the present study,
we have calculated different statistical metrics to validate our pharmacophore
models. The details of different statistical metrics used for the
validation are mentioned below. 1   2   3   4  where
TP = true positive, TN = true negative, FP = false positive, and FN
= false negative.

Molecular Docking
Molecular docking
simulation is commonly employed in structure-based VS campaigns to
explore the behavior of small molecules in binding site of target
protein.39 Molecular docking studies were
carried out to identify the binding mode and binding scores of compounds
shortlisted by the pharmacophore hypotheses. The selection of an optimal
docking software with suitable sampling and scoring algorithm is instrumental
in successful VS campaigns. The accuracy of a docking software depends
on the ability of the software to quantitatively reproduce the crystal
pose and to differentiate between the active and inactive compounds.
In the present study, we have evaluated the performance of three different
docking softwares; MOE [Molecular Operating Environment (MOE), 2018.01;
Chemical Computing Group ULC, 1010 Sherbrooke St. West, Suite #910,
Montreal, QC, Canada, H3A 2R7, 2018.], FRED40 and AutoDock Vina41 (hereafter referred
to as Vina). The ability of the software to produce the crystal pose
was assessed using the redocking experiments, whereas the ability
of the software to differentiate between the active and inactive compounds
were assessed by score-based ranking.

Redocking
To access
the ability of the software to reproduce the crystal pose, we subjected
the cognate ligands to docking simulation. For Vina, the receptor
and ligand were prepared using the Python-based prepare_receptor and
prepare_ligand scripts. The grid was prepared centering at the ligand.
The search spaces and grid coordinates of each complex are tabulated
in Table S4. The global search exhaustiveness
was set to the default value (8), and a total of 10 poses were generated
for each complex.

In case of MOE, the docking site was defined
using the coordinates of cognate ligands. We used “Triangle
Matcher” and London dG as placement and scoring methods, respectively.
The rigid receptor scheme was used for refinement of top 30 poses
generated by placement algorithm, followed by scoring using the GBVi/WSA
dG scoring method. In every instance, 10 poses were recorded.

Fast Rigid Exhaustive Docking (FRED) is implemented in OpenEye software
suite.40 FRED performs ultrafast docking
by symmetrically searching all rotations and translations in ligand
using an exhaustive search space in receptor. The receptors were converted
into the OpenEye binary format (oeb) using the prepare_receptor application
in OpenEye. A conformation database of the cognate ligand was generated
using Omega2 (OpenEye Software, SantaFe, NM, USA). We used ChemGauss4
scoring function and the hit list size was set to 150. For each complex,
a total of 20 poses were recorded. The results were analyzed using
VIDA.42

The quantitative measurement
of difference in the cartesian coordinates of simulated pose and experimental
pose (RMSD) serve as gold standard to evaluate the reliability of
a docking experiment.43 For a satisfactory
redocking experiment, the RMSD value between the cartesian coordinates
of simulated and crystal pose should be less than 3 Å.

Bench-Marking
and Scoring
Apart from the regeneration of crystal pose,
a docking protocol should be able to differentiate between the active
and inactive compounds. Herein, we challenged the ability of Vina
to differentiate between the active and inactive compounds. In this
connection, the available lmNMT crystal structure was utilized (Table S1). The data sets of both active and inactive
compounds were subjected to molecular docking studies using Vina.
The predicted binding free energy of the top-ranked pose of every
compound was retrieved in all instances. For statistical analysis
of results, a receiver operator curve was plotted using ROCR package
in R.44,45

Screening of Maybridge Database
The hits obtained from the pharmacophore-based screening of the Maybridge
database were subjected to molecular docking using Vina using the
protocol mentioned in the redocking section. The prepare_ligand script
was used for the format conversion (from mol2 to PDBQT). For each
compound, 10 poses were generated. However, only the top-ranked pose
for further calculations.

Protein–Ligand Interaction Fingerprinting
The PLIF approach converts the molecular interaction data into
the bit array conforming to the residue ID and interaction type. In
the present study, we calculated the interaction fingerprints of the
top-ranked pose of the VHs obtained from Vina. For format conversion
from PDBQT to mol2, open babel v. 2.4.0 was used.46 The molecules were then imported into MOE as MDB, and PLIF
was generated using only a weak cut off value of 0.5 kcal/mol for
each type of interaction. The compounds were shortlisted on the basis
of interaction with the crucial residues; Tyr80, Phe90, Thr203, Tyr217,
His219, Phe232, Ser330, Asn376, Asp396, and Leu421. The selected hits
were further subjected to MD simulation.

ADME-ToX Prediction
The QikProp module implemented in Schrödinger was used to
calculate the ADME-ToX properties of the selected compounds. The compounds
were imported in Maestro workspace in mol2 format and were subjected
to QikProp calculations in the fast mood. For each molecule, top five
similar drugs were also evaluated. The results were exported in CSV
format for further processing.

MD Simulation
MD simulations were carried out using the pmemd.CUDA module in Amber18
using explicit water model under periodic boundary conditions.47 The force field ff14SB force field was used
for the parametrization of protein.48 The
nonpolar hydrogen atoms of protein were trimmed using the reduce module
in AMBER followed by subsequent protonation via tleap.49 The cofactor Myristoyl-CoA was parameterized
using the second generation GAFF2 force field.50 However, the atomic partial charges of the ligand were
derived by AM1-BCC charge calculation formalism using Antechamber
module in Amber14.51−53 The parmchk2 utility in Antechamber was employed
to generate missing dihedral parameters. The system was then solvated
with the explicit TIP3P water molecules into a periodic box that extended
at a distance of 10 Å from the protein atoms.54

To ensure electroneutrality of the system, counter
ions were introduced into the solvated system, when required. The
topology, coordinates, and the AMBER parameters were generated using
the tleap module in AMBERTOOLS-14. The box dimensions, number of ions
required for neutralization, number of water molecules added, and
the total number of atoms in the systems are tabulated as Table S5.

Energy Minimization, Equilibration,
and MD Production Run
All of the complexes were relaxed before
MD simulations to remove the bad contacts and possible steric clashes.
By performing a short energy minimization, the system was relaxed
before MD simulations, to remove initial bad contacts and steric clashes
by performing energy minimization. Briefly, energy minimization was
carried out to relax the system by decreasing the harmonic force restraints
to the solute atoms (protein–ligand-co-factor complex) involving
the steepest descent and conjugate gradient methods.55 The system was equilibrated in a stepwise manner, by gradually
heating the restrained system, from 0 to 300 K, in an NVT ensemble. The system was then relaxed gradually in an NPT ensemble (pressure = 1 atm). During relaxation, a harmonic restraint
of 25 kcal/mol/Å2 was applied on the solute atoms
for 25 000 steps, which was released gradually.

The production
run was carried out for 100 ns using the isothermal–isobaric
(NPT) ensemble at 300 K temperature and 1 atm pressure
with periodic boundary conditions. The temperature was controlled
using the Berendsen weak-coupling algorithm.56

The particle mesh Ewald method57 integrated into AMBER was utilized to simulate the long-range electrostatic
interactions. The cutoff values for the nonbonded (electrostatics
and van der Waals) interactions were set to 8 Å, and the dielectric
constant was taken as 1. The integration step (dt) was set to 2 fs to integrate the Newtonian equation of motion.
The bond involving the hydrogen atoms were constrained using the SHAKE
algorithm.58

The mass-weighted RMSD,
RMSF, and RoG calculations were performed using CPPTRAJ59 module in AMBERTOOLS18. The distances between
the heavy atoms were calculated using the CPPTRAJ. All of the graphs
were generated using gnuplot.60

Molecular
Mechanics/Generalized Born Surface Area Calculations
The
molecular mechanics/generalized Born surface area (MM/GBSA) calculations
were performed to assess the electrostatic contribution of the solvation
free energy using generalized Born (GB) model implemented in AMBER18.61 For solute protein (εin), the
dielectric constant value was set to 1 and the exterior was set to
80. The GB model developed by Onufriev et al. (GBOBC1) with igb =
2 and mbondi2 parameterized radii implemented in Amber software package
were used.62 The nonpolar contributions
(ΔG nonpolar) were calculated with the linear
combinations of the pairwise overlaps method.63 The surface tension (γ) and offset (β) values were set
to 0.00542 kcal/(mol Å2) and 0.92 kcal/mol, respectively.
