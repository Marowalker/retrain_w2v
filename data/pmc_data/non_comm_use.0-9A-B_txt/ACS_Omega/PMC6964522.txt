In this study, 9-(diphenylphosphanyl)[7]helicene was
prepared as
a suitable ligand for the subsequent synthesis of palladium complexes.
The corresponding PdL2Cl2 complex was then successfully
obtained in both racemic and enantiopure forms. The PdL2Cl2 complex emerges exclusively in the trans arrangement showing dynamic interconversion between its homo- and
heterochiral forms as evidenced by 31P NMR. The trans arrangement was ultimately confirmed by X-ray crystallography
using single crystals of the homochiral complex. Additionally, the
PdL2Cl2 complex was subjected to screening of
its catalytic activity in a Suzuki-type reaction of aryl bromides
with aryl boronic acids showing fair yields of the resulting biaryls.
However, the final asymmetric reactions catalyzed by the optically
pure PdL2Cl2 complex provided targeted binaphtyls
only in negligible enantiomeric excess.

Introduction
Helicenes are polycyclic aromatic nonplanar
compounds consisting
of ortho-fused benzene rings.1−10 Due to the steric hindrance of the terminal benzene rings, helicenes
become screw-shaped, adopting a nonplanar arrangement with the C2-symmetric
axis perpendicular to the helix axis. This makes them inherently chiral.
Owing to the large π-electron system and inherent chirality,
helicenes possess a number of interesting chemical, physical, electronic,
and optical properties, which make them an attractive object of study
in many fields of research11 including
asymmetric catalysis.12

The idea
of helicene framework utilization in enantioselective
synthesis is rather old. The pioneering work was done by Ben Hassine
et al. in the mid-1980s, where 2-hydroxy- and 2-cyano-[7]helicene
derivatives were used as chiral auxiliaries in stoichiometric reactions.13 Subsequently, a number of studies have emerged
employing helicene-based alcohols,13,14 nitrogen,15−17 and phosphorus18−20 functionalities attached to or directly built into
the helicene moiety. Even unsubstituted carbohelicenes were successfully
used in asymmetric catalysis, namely, in diisopropylzinc addition
to pyrimidine-5-carbaldehyde.21 In general,
the optically pure helicene substrates used for these purposes are
usually obtained via chiral chromatography, while the resolution via
diastereomers is less common.22 The only
synthetic approach to fully aromatic optically pure carbohelicenes
has been introduced recently by Stary et al.23

Regarding asymmetric transition-metal catalysis, helicenes
were
employed as ligands for the first time in 1997 by Reetz et al.24 The prepared 2,15-bis(diphenylphosphino)-[6]helicene
was used for in situ generation of a rhodium complex and subsequent
enantioselective hydrogenation of an itaconic acid ester in a promising
39% ee. The same ligand was also successfully utilized for kinetic
resolution in palladium-catalyzed allylic substitution.25 Unfortunately, apart from phosphahelicenes,
where phosphorus-containing heterocycles are directly built into the
helical scaffold,26−32 and phosphite prepared by Stary et al.,33 the phosphorus-appended carbohelicenes did not provide any significant
achievements in enantioselective synthesis. On the other hand, thorough
screening of the catalytic activity has not been performed until now,
probably due to the low synthetic availability of these ligands. An
overview of helicene and helicene-like molecule implementation in
the asymmetric catalysis has recently been published by Marinetti
et al.12

It is also worth stressing
that the catalytically active species
are usually generated in situ by mixing the ligand with transition-metal
precursors. The resulting structure and properties of active species
remain unexplored, and the catalytic activity is in helicene chemistry
usually restricted to basic screening experiments.25 Therefore, we present here the synthesis of 9-(diphenylphosphanyl)[7]helicene34 as a suitable ligand for preparation of palladium
complexes, the preparation of the corresponding Pd complex in both
racemic and enantiopure forms, a description of its properties, and
a subsequent screening of its catalytic activity.

Results and Discussion
Synthesis of the Palladium Complex of 9-(Diphenylphosphanyl)[7]helicene 5
In general, there are two possibilities of introducing
a functional group to the carbohelicene skeleton: to functionalize
the final helical molecule or its non-helical stilbene precursor35 prior to final cyclization. For the introduction
of the phosphine group, the original procedure was adapted for helicene
chemistry by Reetz et al.24 It involves
halide-lithium exchange reactions between a suitable helical precursor
and corresponding diaryl halophosphines.19,36 The procedure used in our group utilizes a palladium-catalyzed C-P
coupling between diarylphosphine and helicene substituted by a suitable
leaving group.37

The reaction of
9-bromo[7]helicene381 with
diphenylphosphine catalyzed by Herrmann’s catalyst performed
under microwave at 160 °C provides 9-(diphenylphosphanyl)[7]helicene 2 (Scheme 1). In order to prevent rapid oxidation of resulting phosphine 2 to its oxide 3, it is necessary to furnish
the phosphine group by the borane protective group before the reaction
is worked up. The oxidation of 2 promoted by air can
proceed within minutes as observed by NMR analysis. The conditions
of the original microwave-assisted coupling reaction were revised
and optimized (for details, see the Experimental
Section - Method A). Using higher amounts of diphenylphosphine,
base, and borane-Lewis base complex leads to complete conversion and
provides borane complex 4 in reproducible 84% overall
yield compared to the original 52%.34

Scheme 1 Introduction of Phosphine Group to the Helical Scaffold
Further improvement of reaction conditions leads
to a performance
at lower temperature. The same reaction carried out at reflux in THF
for 6 h provided the same yield as the microwave-assisted reaction
(for details, see the Experimental Section - Method B). Keeping the temperature as low as possible is important
especially when working with enantiomerically pure helicenes to minimize
the risk of partial racemization. Ultimately, these reaction conditions
were used for the final synthesis of optical pure ligand 2 and the corresponding palladium complex (see below).

Conventionally,
the phosphine-borane complex can be deprotected
in the presence of amines.39 In situ generated
free phosphine ligand 2 could then be reacted with a
palladium source like PdCl2·2H2O or Pd(MeCN)2Cl2 and isolated as such (Scheme 2). However, the release of phosphine from
its borane complex 4 brought an unexpected challenge
in our case. All standard deprotection attempts using amines led to
irreproducible results in the generation of the final Pd complex,
probably due to the presence of residual amines. A reduction of the
palladium source was observed ordinarily.

Scheme 2 General Scheme of
Phosphine Deprotection and Synthesis of a Pd Complex
Alternatively, a protection by formation of
phosphonium salt by
a simple treatment with HBF4 and subsequent release of
a free phosphine ligand by addition of a base was considered.40 However, using a proton as a protective element
to avoid oxidation of phosphine 2 to its oxide 3 instead of borane was also found impractical. Targeted helicenylphosphonium 6 was inseparable from H2PPh2+BF4–, which emerges in the reaction
mixture as well (Scheme 3). A similar situation arose in the case of diethylamine-mediated
borane deprotection of 4 followed by addition of an excess
of etheric tetrafluoroboric acid. Furthermore, phosphonium tetrafluoroborate 6 decomposed on silica to its phosphine oxide, and crystallization
did not proceed at all.

Scheme 3 Synthesis of Phosphonium Salt 6
On the other hand, tetrafluoroboric acid can
also serve as an efficient
agent for borane deprotection, as demonstrated by McKinstry and Livinghouse.41 Indeed, the NMR titration experiment showed
that an excess of 6 equiv. of etheric tetrafluoroboric acid is necessary
to achieve full deprotection. The resulting mixture of phosphonium 6 and tetrafluoroboric acid was subsequently treated with
an excess of potassium carbonate under an inert atmosphere to generate
pure phosphine 2 quantitatively.

A reaction of
phosphine ligand 2 with the palladium
source provided corresponding palladium complex 5 reproducibly
in overall 70% yield (Scheme 4).

Scheme 4 Protocol for Palladium Complex Preparation
Phosphonium 6 has to be stored
under strictly inert
conditions; otherwise, it will decompose into borane-phosphine oxide
complex 7. This behavior was observed in dichloromethane
solution by 19F and 31P NMR and confirmed by
targeted synthesis from 3 (Scheme 5).

Scheme 5 Formation of Trifluoroborate-Phosphine
Oxide Complex 7
Palladium complex 5 prepared in
both racemic and enantiopure
forms according to the previously described method was further investigated
with the emphasis on its structure and catalytic activity.

Structure Determination
Palladium complex 5 prepared from racemic starting material 1 was isolated
as a yellow powder. The presence of both helical forms in the synthesis
(M - left-handed and P - right-handed
form) implies the formation of homochiral (M,M and P,P) and heterochiral
(M,P and P,M meso-forms) diastereomers. Additionally, complex formation
of cis and trans arrangements in
the Pd coordination sphere can be also expected. However, the 31P NMR spectrum of complex 5 revealed only two
signals at 19.63 and 19.12 ppm. Unfortunately, a detailed analysis
of the complex structure by conventional NMR experiments seemed impossible
due to a severe signal overlap in the 1H and 13C NMR spectra. Nevertheless, high-resolution MS undoubtedly confirmed
the presence of the demanded Pd complex.

The attempts at crystallization
of complex 5 from a dichloromethane/methanol solution
performed at −18 °C provided only a yellowish powder. 31P NMR spectra of this precipitate revealed an enriched mixture
of 5 with a 3:1 ratio of the signals in favor of the
downfield one. The signal ratio was developing in time providing a
1:1 signal ratio within 5 h at 25 °C (Figure 1a). This dynamic behavior was subsequently
described as the first-order kinetics of a reversible reaction (Figure 1b, Scheme 6) with an equilibration rate
constant that is equal to 9.5 × 10–5 s–1 and Gibbs free energy ΔG298‡ = 22.5
kcal/mol.

kinetics for a reversible reaction (b); 31P NMR of a formation
of trans-[Pd(L,PPh3)Cl2] (c).

Scheme 6 Dissociative Mechanism of Homochiral (M,M and P,P) and
Heterochiral
(M,P and P,M) Diastereomer Equilibration of 5
A first-order kinetics indicated a dissociative
mechanism, which
brought us to the experiment with the introduction of triphenylphosphine
into solution as a second ligand (Figure 1c). A complex with a mixed ligand sphere
(Pd(L,PPh3)Cl2) was prepared by NMR titration
of complex 5 by triphenylphosphine. 31P NMR
spectra showed immediate formation of the mixed complex characterized
by two doublets with a coupling constant of 556 Hz. The high value
of 2J(PP) indicated the formation of a
complex in trans configuration (Figure 1c). The formation of complex 5 exclusively in the trans arrangement was
also supported by DFT calculation (B3LYP; LANL2DZ for Pd, 6-31G for
other atoms) providing a 13.9 kcal mol–1 difference
in favor of trans-5. These findings
led us to the conclusion that the two original peaks in 31P NMR spectra correspond to homo- and heterochiral complexes of trans-5. The ultimate confirmation of this
hypothesis was provided by the synthesis of complex 5 from a chiral ligand and from the X-ray structure of racemic complex 5 (see below).

It turned out that racemic complex 5 crystallizes
spontaneously from chlorinated solvents. Small prismatic crystals
were formed above the solution surface during slow solvent evaporation
at 8 °C. Unfortunately, obtained single crystals decomposed readily
due to solvent escape from the crystal lattice. The decomposition
was so fast that it was not even possible to perform basic crystallographic
operations like crystal selection, mounting, and transfer into a diffractometer.
Therefore, the final crystallization was performed in a glass capillary,
which was transported on dry ice and then mounted into a precooled
diffractometer. The suitable single crystal was then selected directly
in the diffractometer. Despite these measures, the obtained diffraction
data were of relatively low quality (for details, see the Experimental Section). However, the structure was
easily solved, revealing two molecules of homochiral complex 5 in the trans arrangement forming the independent
part of the unit cell (Figure 2a). Both molecules contain only helicene moieties of M helicity. Homochiral complex molecules containing exclusively P helicenes are generated by a symmetry operation of the Pn space group. The pairs of homochiral complexes differ
mutually only in the orientation of phenyl moieties (Figure 2b). In the crystal lattice,
the complex molecules form distinct layers arranged along the Z axis, which are penetrated solvent molecules (Figure 2c,d). Disordered
solvent molecules occupy in total approximately one-fourth of the
crystal volume.

molecules in the crystal lattice (c); voids in a single layer of complex
molecules (d).

Catalytic Study
The catalytic activity of Pd(II) complex 5 was examined in model Suzuki-type reactions of aryl bromides
with aryl boronic acids focusing on the synthesis of axially chiral
biaryl molecules. The influence of solvent, catalyst loading, the
aryl halide used, and the electronic and steric demands of substrates
were studied; the results are summarized in the following tables.
To ensure the comparability of achieved results, all reactions were
carried out for 4 h. An excess of 1.5 equiv. of aryl boronic acid,
2.0 equiv. of cesium carbonate as a base, and elevated temperature
were used to achieve a maximal conversion. A model reaction of 2-bromotoluene
with 2-methoxy phenylboronic acid was chosen for reaction condition
optimization (Scheme 7). The reaction conversion was determined by GC–MS following
the decrease of aryl bromide.

Scheme 7 Reaction of 2-Bromotoluene with 2-Methoxy
Phenylboronic Acid as a
Model Reaction
The screening of solvent influence was performed
at 80 °C
or solvent reflux. The reaction conversion depends significantly on
the solvent used, as summarized in Table 1. The most suitable solvent for the model
reaction is THF (entry 6). Therefore, THF was used for the rest of
the catalytic studies exclusively.

Subsequently, a screening of the catalyst loading
was carried out
in THF at reflux with 0.1 up to 10 mol % catalyst 5.
All four reactions gave comparable results, reaching almost full conversion
(Table 2). Hence, 0.1
mol % 5 was found sufficient for the rest of the catalytic
studies (entry 4).

a Determined by GC–MS after

Furthermore, the reactivity of 5 was
tested in a series
of phenyl halides. The identical reactions were performed for comparison
with a structurally related [Pd(PPh3)2Cl2]. The obtained results are summarized in Table 3.

a Determined by GC–MS after

The performance of 5 in the case of phenyl
iodide
was found almost comparable with [Pd(PPh3)2Cl2] (entries 1 and 4). In the case of phenyl bromide, [Pd(PPh3)2Cl2] provided the same conversion
as for PhI, while the reaction catalyzed by 5 provided
only 50% conversion (entries 2 and 5). Finally, no catalytic activity
was observed for phenyl chloride for both catalysts (entries 3 and
6).

Despite the better reactivity of aryl iodides, the screening
of
steric and electronic effects was performed on aryl bromides due to
their better commercial availability. The data summarized in Table 4 show that diversely
substituted boronic acids readily react with 2-bromotoluene, giving
higher yields. The reactivity decreased from electronically rich to
electronically poor aryl boronic acids (entries 1 to 3). The drop
in conversion of reaction with 2,5-dimethylphenylboronic acid (entry
4) can be attributed to greater steric demands rather than to electronic
effects.

An opposite trend was observed when electronically
rich aryl halide
was used as a starting material (Table 5). The difference in reactivity was found significant
especially between 2-MeO- and 2-Me-substituted bromobenzenes (entries
1 and 2). A further increase of the already very high reactivity going
from Me- to electronically poor CF3-substituted aryl halide
(entries 2 and 3) was not observed.

In order to evaluate the steric effects, a series
of substituted
phenyl and naphtyl bromides and also phenyl and naphtylboronic acids
were tested in Suzuki reactions (Table 6). Surprisingly, 4-methylphenyl bromide shows a decrease
in reactivity compared to the 2-methyl derivative (entries 1 and 2),
while substitution of phenyl and naphtyl bromides in position 2 does
not affect the reactivity toward aryl boronic acids (entries 1, 3,
and 4). Even 2-isopropylnaphtyl bromide reacts readily with naphtylboronic
acid (entry 5). However, no reaction was observed using naphtylboronic
acid with any substituent in the ortho-position (entries
6 and 7).

Table 6 Evaluation of the Steric Effects
a Determined by GC–MS after
4 h (from calibration curves of the starting material).

According to the obtained results, the palladium complex 5 showed reasonable catalytic activity in a series of Suzuki-type
model reactions. Naphtylboronic acid in a reaction with naphtyl bromides
provides corresponding binaphtyls (Table 6, entries 4 and 5) in very good yields. These
substrates are well known for their higher stability toward racemization.42 Therefore, they were utilized in the final screening
focused on chirality induced by optically pure 5.

The enantiomers (M)-1 and (P)-1 were obtained from rac-1 using chiral HPLC (see the Experimental
Section). Due to possible racemization at elevated temperature,
the synthesis of enantiomerically pure phosphine 2 was
carried out through synthetic route B at reflux in THF. Following
the procedure optimized for synthesis of rac-5, optical pure forms of 5 were prepared in overall
yields of 48% for (P,P)-5 and 50% for (M,M)-5. 31P NMR spectra of individual (PP)-
and (MM)-homochiral complexes 5 revealed
one signal at 19.12 ppm. Subsequently, (M,M)-5 was employed in an asymmetric Suzuki reaction
providing hindered binaphtyls (Scheme 8).

Scheme 8 Screening of Chirality Induction by (M,M)-PdL2Cl2 (5)
Both reactions proceeded smoothly in high conversion.
However,
the enantiomeric excess of the reaction was found negligible: only
4% ee for 2-methyl-1,1′-binaphthalene and also 4% ee for the
isopropyl derivative. These results indicate a relatively small involvement
of the helicene cavity in the asymmetric induction when the phosphanyl
group is located on the periphery of a helicene skeleton.

Conclusions
9-(Diphenylphosphanyl)[7]helicene 2 was prepared in
high yields and utilized as a ligand in the synthesis of the corresponding
palladium complex. The synthetic pathway leading to phosphine 2 and corresponding Pd complex 5 was developed
and optimized enabling the synthesis in optically pure forms. The
obtained PdL2Cl2 complex 5 was
isolated and characterized in both racemic and chiral forms. The complex
emerged exclusively in the trans arrangement due
to the high steric demands of the ligand as documented by 31P NMR spectroscopy and X-ray crystallography. Furthermore, time-dependent 31P NMR spectroscopy of the isolated complex revealed dynamic
interconversion between its homo- and heterochiral forms providing
a 1:1 mixture in equilibrium. The catalytic activity of the Pd complex
was thoroughly investigated in a Suzuki-type reaction of aryl bromides
with aryl boronic acids. A catalyst loading of 0.1 mol % was found
to be satisfactory to provide high reaction yields. However, the catalytic
activity was found to be slightly lower than that of Pd(PPh3)2Cl2. The performance of (M,M)-PdL2Cl2 in asymmetric
catalysis was tested in the reaction of naphtyl bromides. However,
the targeted binaphtyls were obtained only in negligible enantiomeric
excess.

This first thorough catalytic study of a palladium complex
bearing
helicenyl phosphine ligands confirms that such complexes can be utilized
in homogeneous catalysis. However, for asymmetric catalysis, it is
essential to shift the phosphine group from the helicene periphery
closer to the helicene cavity. Further experiments with such helical
phosphines are currently under progress in our laboratory.

Materials and Methods
1H, 13C{1H}, 19F, 31P, and 31P{1H} NMR spectra were recorded using an Inova 500 MHz Varian
instrument. Chemical shifts are reported in parts per million (δ)
relative to TMS, CFCl3, and PPh3 (−6
ppm) or referenced to residuals of CDCl3 (δ = 7.26
and δ = 77.00 ppm, respectively), CD2Cl2 (δ = 5.30 and 54.00 ppm, respectively), and CD3CN (δ = 1.94 and 118.69 ppm, respectively). The coupling constants J are given in hertz. The HMBC experiments were set up for JC–H = 5 Hz. For the correct assignment
of both the 1H and 13C NMR spectra of key compounds,
COSY, HSQC, and HMBC experiments were performed. GC–MS analyses
were performed on an Agilent 6890 gas chromatograph coupled to an
Agilent 5973 mass spectrometer operating in 70 eV ionization mode.
A DB-5MS column (30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 μm) was used
with He as a carrier gas at a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min. The initial
temperature was 50 °C hold for 3 min, programmed at 10 °C/min
to 290 °C or 310 °C. The injection port was set at 250,
300, or 310 °C, depending on the volatility of the sample, and
the m/z values are given along with
their relative intensities (%). For exact mass measurement, the spectra
were internally calibrated using Na formate or tuning mix APCI-TOF.
ESI and APCI high-resolution mass spectra were measured in positive
mode by a micrOTOF QIII mass spectrometer (Bruker) and were determined
by Compass Data Analysis software. Infrared spectra were determined
on a Nicolet 6700 in chloroform. EDX analysis was determined on the
aluminum substrate using an SE microscope equipped with an energy-dispersive
X-ray spectroscopy detector (Quantax 125 eV, Bruker). The measurement
error is below 10% for P, Cl, and Pd. TLC was performed on silica
gel 60 F254- or 60 RP-18 F254 S-coated aluminum
sheets, and compounds were visualized by UV light (254 and 366 nm).
Column chromatography was performed on an HPFC Biotage Isolera One
system with prepacked flash silica gel columns KP-Sil Silica and KP-C18-HS
cartridges (0.040–0.063 mm). The standard Schlenk technique
was used for all reactions. The cannula filtration technique was used
for filtrations under an inert atmosphere. Microwave experiments were
performed on an Anton Paar Monowave 300 equipped with simultaneous
temperature measurement with an IR and fiber optic sensor. Resolution
of enantiomers was determined on preparative HPLC with a UV detector
at 320 nm (Watrex) using a chiral stationary phase Chiralpak IA (Daicel
Corp.) column (250 × 20 mm, 10 μm) and n-heptane/dichloromethane/methyl tert-butyl ether
(94:5.75:025 for 1) as a mobile phase at a flow rate
of 10 mL/min. The optical purity of each enantiomer was studied by
integration of UV traces (254 nm) of HPLC chromatograms on a Varian
ProStar 230 SDA + ProStar 330 PDA detector (200–400 nm) using
an analytical Chiralpak IA (Daicel Corp.) column (250 × 4.6 mm,
5 μm) at a flow rate of 2 mL/min. Specific rotations were measured
at 589 nm in chloroform at 20 °C on a JASCO P-2000 polarimeter
and are given in deg. cm3 g–1 dm–1 as an average value from 50 measurements. Solvents
were degassed by five freeze–pump–thaw cycles. Tetrahydrofuran
and toluene were freshly distilled from sodium/benzophenone under
an atmosphere of argon. Commercially available reagents were purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich, Fluorochem, or TCI Europe and used as received.

was stirred for 15 min at room temperature, then potassium carbonate
(94 mg, 0.68 mmol, 20 equiv.) was added in argon backflow, and the
reaction mixture was stirred at the same temperature for another 15
min. Inorganic salts were filtered off under an argon atmosphere,
and solvents were removed at reduced pressure. The reaction provided
9-(diphenylphosphanyl)[7]helicene 2 (19.6 mg, 98%) as
a yellow powder in satisfactory purity as checked by 1H

Dissociation Constant Determination
The experimental
data were collected from integration of 31P{1H} NMR signals of homochiral (P,P and M,M) and heterochiral (P,M and M,P) diastereomeric pairs of 5 in a time-dependent NMR
experiment. The rise of concentration of homochiral pairs was plotted
against time and fitted by the exponential function y = y0 + A1e–x/t1 (R2 = 0.99445; see Figure 1b). The fitting curve
was forced to converge to 50% concentration corresponding to a 1:1
diastereomers ratio. The data extrapolation allowed the calculation
of the t1/2, and the equation t1/2 = ln 2/k provided the rate
constant of equilibration (k = 9.46 × 10–5 s–1). Gibbs free energy was consequently
calculated using the Eyring equation ΔG‡(T) = −RT ln((kh)/(κkBT)), where R is the gas constant (R = 8.31441 J/K), h is the Planck constant (h = 6.626176 × 10–34 J s), kB is the Boltzmann constant (kB = 1.380662 × 10–23 J/K), and
κ is the transmission coefficient (κ = 0.5 for a reversible
first-order reaction was used).

Computational Details on Gibbs Free Energy
All geometries
of ground states were optimized using the Gaussian 03 program.46 The DFT computations were carried out using
the B3LYP functional.47,48 The palladium atom was described
by a double-ζ basis set with the effective core potential of
(ECP) Hay and Wadt (LANL2DZ), and the 6-31G basis set was used for
the other elements. Cartesian coordinates of the DFT-optimized structures
and corresponding relative Gibbs free energies can be found in the Supporting Information.

X-ray Crystallography
Diffraction data were collected
on a Bruker D8 VENTURE Kappa Duo PHOTON 100 CMOS with monochromated
Mo/Cu Kα radiation. The structures were solved by the direct
methods (SHELXT49) and refined by full-matrix
least-squares on F2 values (SHELXL49). Due to the observed rapid decomposition of
single crystals during preliminary measurements, complex 5 was crystallized from tetrachloroethane directly in 0.6 mm borosilicate
Mark-tubes (Hilgenberg GmbH) at 8 °C. The capillary containing
suitable single crystals was sealed at the same temperature and transported
on dry ice. The capillary was mounted into a precooled diffractometer.
A particular single crystal was selected in the diffractometer. Using
these measures, it was possible to obtain usable reflection data.
However, the presence of other single crystals close to the X-ray
beam, a difficult crystal centering due to water condensed on the
capillary, absorption of the capillary, and also a large number of
disordered solvent molecules trapped in the crystal lattice significantly
affected the overall quality of diffraction data. All these circumstances
resulted in a low ratio of observed to unique reflections (41%). Although
the structure was easily solved revealing the trans arrangement in the complex molecule and the helicity of each helicenyl
ligand, a rigid body refinement had to be applied to all helicene
and phenyl moieties in the structure. A structure of [7]helicene (refcode HPTHEL04)50 was used as a template
for helicene rigid body refinement. Eventually, only palladium, chlorine,
and phosphorus atoms were refined anisotropically. Carbon atoms were
refined isotropically within rigid body refinement. Hydrogen atoms
were localized from the expected geometry, were fixed into idealized
positions (riding model) with assigned temperature factors Hiso(H)
= 1.2 Ueq(pivot carbon atom), and were not refined. The disordered
solvent molecules in the structure occupying a solvent accessible
volume of 1855 Å3 were treated by the SQUEEZE procedure.51 ORTEP-351 and BIOVIA Discovery Studio
Visualizer (Accelrys Inc.) were used for structure presentation.

General Procedure for Catalysis of Suzuki Reaction
Aryl halide (20 mg, 0.08–0.12 mmol, 1 equiv.), boronic acid
(1.5 equiv.), cesium carbonate (2 equiv.), and catalyst were loaded
into a Schlenk flask and dissolved in the solvent (2 mL) under an
argon atmosphere. The reaction mixture was heated to 80 °C (or
reflux) for 4 h. The reaction mixture was filtered through a short
silica gel column. Relative conversion to the internal standard (n-hexadecane) was determined by GC–MS from the calibration
curves of the products and/or starting material.

All products
of the catalysis are known from the literature except 2-isopropyl-1,1′-binaphthalene.

2-Isopropyl-1,1′-binaphthalene
1-Bromo-2-isopropylnaphthalene
(500 mg, 2.02 mmol), naphthalen-1-ylboronic acid (520 mg, 3.02 mmol,
1.5 equiv.), cesium carbonate (1316 mg, 4.04 mmol, 2 equiv.), and
bis(triphenylphosphine)palladium chloride (71 mg, 0.10 mmol, 5 mol
%) were dissolved in tetrahydrofuran (10 mL) under an argon atmosphere.
The reaction was stirred at reflux for 4 h. After evaporation, the
residue was dissolved in DCM (20 mL) and washed with brine (2 ×
20 mL, saturated solution) and water (20 mL). Combined organic phases
were then dried over MgSO4 and evaporated, and the residue
was purified by flash chromatography using reversed-phase silica gel
and acetonitrile/water 8:2 as a mobile phase. 2-Isopropyl-1,1′-binaphthalene
was obtained as a beige oil (314 mg, 53% yield). HPLC analyses were
performed on a Chiralcel OD-H (Chiral) column (250 × 4.6 mm,
5 μm) using n-heptane as a mobile phase at
a flow rate of 1 mL/min. Chiral separation: tR = 8.9 min ((−)-2-isopropyl-1,1′-binaphthalene),
12.9 min ((+)-2-isopropyl-1,1′-binaphthalene). Specific rotations
of dextrorotatory = (+)-2-isopropyl-1,1′-binaphthalene and
levorotatory (−)-2-isopropyl-1,1′-binaphthalene were
measured in CHCl3: [α]D20 = +89.0 ± 2.3 (c 0.17) and [α]D20 = −87.8 ± 2.4 (c 0.17).
