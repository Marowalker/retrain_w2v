Over
the past decades, desalination by reverse osmosis (RO) membranes
has attracted increasing attention. Although RO has proven its efficiency,
it remains, however, relatively costly because of the use of high-pressure
pumps and the low water permeability of conventional cross-linked
polymer membranes. One route to improve the desalination performance
consists of using membranes made from sub-nanoporous boron nitride
(sNBN) monolayers. Indeed, by using molecular dynamics simulations,
we report here that the water permeability of such sNBN membranes
far exceeds that of conventional RO polymer membranes and is even
higher than that of nanoporous graphene while the ion rejection remains
close to 100%. At the same time, the molecular mechanism of water
and ion transport through sNBN has been elucidated, with special attention
paid to the impact of ions on water permeability through sNBN membranes.

Introduction
With freshwater sources
in short supply and uneven availability,
efficient and sustainable technologies for water desalination have
a crucial role to play in addressing the world’s clean water
needs in the 21st century.1,2 Desalination is, in
many regards, the most promising approach to solve the global issue
of freshwater scarcity because the salted water resource on the earth
is “virtually unlimited”. Over the past decades, seawater
desalination by reverse osmosis (RO) membranes has become a common
method for countries with direct access to the sea. Although RO has
proven its efficiency, it remains, however, relatively costly because
of (i) seawater osmotic pressure, which requires the use of high-pressure
pumps, and (ii) the low water permeability of conventional RO membranes,
which requires large membrane surface areas.1−3 Recently, considerable
effort has been invested in the development of new RO membranes to
improve the water permeability. However, it was recently pointed out
that energy savings allowed by these ultrapermeable membranes exhibit
a law of diminishing returns because of thermodynamics and concentration
polarization at the membrane surface leading to a limited improvement
compared with the current levels of energy consumption achieved with
polyamide membranes.2,4−6 For instance,
it was established that a tripling in water permeability would allow
for 15% less energy for a seawater RO plant with a given capacity
and recovery ratio.5 Despite these limitations
regarding seawater desalination, it is fundamental to capture and
to understand the microscopic mechanisms ruling water and ion transport
through these two-dimensional (2D) membranes and to continue our attempts
to predict and to develop materials and processes that will allow
optimizing membrane separations. Among popular nanoporous materials,
carbon nanotube (CNT) arrays7 have been
widely investigated as potential candidates for water desalination.
Both experiments and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have demonstrated
that CNTs can allow fast water flow8−13 and a salt rejection about 95%.14 Another
route to improve both salt rejection and water permeability consists
of using 2D nanoporous membranes such as graphene sheets containing
artificial (sub) nanometric holes.15,16 Water can
flow across such 2D membranes thanks to its small molecular size,
whereas ion passage can be blocked given the larger size of the ion
hydration shell. Recently, several groups have theoretically investigated
the molecular mechanisms ruling water transport and ionic selectivity
through stacked sheets of graphene oxide,17,18 nanoporous graphene,5,15,19−21 graphyne,22,23 MoS2,24 C2N,25 and theoretical supersquare26 membranes.
Garnier et al. have shown from MD simulations that the water flux
through sub-nanoporous boron nitride (sNBN) monolayer membranes is
expected to be higher than that through nanoporous graphene monolayers,
thus heralding that 2D boron nitride (BN) could be an attractive candidate
for the next generation of nanofilters.27 More recently, Srivastava et al. showed the potential applicability
of BN as an efficient adsorbent for the removal of arsenic ions.28 In comparison with carbon-based materials, BN
exhibits higher chemical stability, improved biocompatibility, higher
Young modulus, and better resistance to oxidation at high temperatures.
Furthermore, BN nanotubes have shown superior water permeability performance
compared with CNTs of similar diameter and length,29,30 which has been attributed to frictionless transport.12,13,25,31 To date, however, desalination performance of 2D sNBN membranes
has never been investigated. In this work, we performed MD simulations
in order to predict sodium chloride rejection and water permeability
of four sNBN membranes having different pore sizes and geometries,
namely, two hydrogenated circular pores with two different sizes (hereinafter
referred to as sNBN@1 and sNBN@3), a dehydrogenated circular pore
(hereinafter referred to as sNBN@4), and a dehydrogenated triangular
pore (hereinafter referred to as sNBN@2). sNBN@2 and sNBN@4 are not
hydrogenated given the constrained geometry and the small pore radius
that prevent the hydrogen grafting. The choice of investigating a
triangular pore was motivated by the existence of natural triangle-shaped
defects in hexagonal BN monolayers.32,33 Given the
difficulty to generate nanopores with a controlled size,16 it would then be relevant to use these defects
as selective pores.32,33 An illustration of the four different
membranes is provided in Figure 1. Pores with surface areas of the same order of magnitude
compared to those of the (sub-nanometric) natural defects in BN were
considered. The pore surface area was calculated by rolling a nitrogen
molecule probe along the pore surface. The surface area of a nanopore
was calculated by a difference between the accessible surface area
of nonporous monolayer and the accessible surface area of porous membrane.
Calculation of accessible surface area is detailed in the Supporting Information. Force field and computational
procedure are described in the Methods section.
The relevance of the water–BN force field parameters was checked
by comparing the contact angle of a water droplet on a BN monolayer
computed from MD with experimental data. Details of simulations are
given in the Methods section. A predicted
contact angle of 55° was thus found, which is in good agreement
with the experiment (40–60°).34 As illustrated in Figure 2a, pressure-driven transport properties of sNBN monolayers
were investigated by carrying out nonequilibrium MD (NEMD) simulations,
where two rigid pistons were used to generate a pressure difference
(ΔP) across the sNBN membrane. The protocol
was specified in the Methods section.

Results and Discussion
Water Permeability
In Figure 2b, we report
the water permeability (Pw) of the four
membranes as a function of ΔP for pure water
and 1 M NaCl solutions. Pw was calculated
by counting the number of water molecules
(Nw) crossing the membrane as a function
of time. Data were analyzed at steady state, that is, when Nw was found to vary linearly with time (see
Figure S1 of the Supporting Information). Water transport across 2D porous materials is influenced by both
the interfacial interactions and the friction between the water molecules
and the membrane material.12,13 Tocci et al. highlighted
the very weak friction between water molecules and hexagonal BN,35 which favors sliding and transport of water
molecules across sNBN pores. As expected, sNBN@1 and sNBN@2, with
the two highest pore surface areas (see Figure 1), exhibit the highest pure water permeabilities.
Strikingly, the narrowest pore, sNBN@4, is found to be more permeable
to pure water than the wider sNBN@3 pore. This finding indicates that
the discrepancy between the water permeability of the various sNBN
membranes cannot be explained solely by the different pore sizes.
As depicted in Figure 3a, which shows the 2D density profile of water close to sNBN@4, the
size of the water density pattern indicates single-file transport
across this membrane (see the illustration in Figure 3b). It results from the ultraconstrained
geometry where water molecules can be transferred only one at a time.
Such a transport mode was not observed for the other sNBN membranes
with wider pores. The single-file transport leads to a less cohesive
hydrogen-bond (HB) network of water molecules across sNBN@4 than across
the other membranes. For instance, the calculation of the number of
HBs (nHB)36 between water
molecules in the transit zone (which is defined in Figure 2a between z = −3 Å and z = 3 Å) leads to nHB = 1.1 ± 0.2 and nHB = 2.2 ±
0.2 for sNBN@4 and sNBN@1, respectively, which corroborates single-file
transport mechanism through sNBN@4. As shown in Figure 2b, the addition of salt leads to a decrease
in Pw for sNBN@1 and sNBN@2. It results
from the additional resistance to water transfer caused by ions during
their translocation through the pore. It is illustrated in Figure 4, which shows a sodium
cation “blocked” inside the sNBN@2 pore, thus leading
to a substantial hindrance to water permeability (see also the movie
provided in the Supporting Information).
The impact of salt on the water permeability is found to be weaker
for sNBN@1 because of its wider surface area (43.8 Å2), which allows ions to be transferred with their full first hydration
shell (see Figure S2 of the Supporting Information) without significant hindrance to water flow. Indeed, the average
distance between Na+ and the oxygen atoms of water molecules
in the sNBN@1 pore is about 3.3 Å, which highlights that these
water molecules belong to the first hydration shell of Na+ (a similar qualitative behavior was observed for Cl– ions). Interestingly, we also report in Figure S3 of the Supporting Information the trajectory of a water
molecule and its hydration number in the first shell through sNBN@1. Figure S3 shows that the water molecule also
conserves its hydration shell during the translocation given the size
of pore. Strikingly, water permeability is found to be almost unaffected
by the presence of ions for sNBN@4 (see Figure 2b). Actually, the very small pore of sNBN@4
and sNBN@3 prevents the passage of hydrated ions, and the high energetic
penalty associated with ion dehydration results in a total ion rejection
by sNBN@4 (see below). Ions cannot enter the pore and then have a
much less impact on water permeability compared to the other membranes
with wider pores (note that single-file transport was still observed
for sNBN@4 in the presence of ions). It is noteworthy that the impact
of ion translocation on water permeability through sNBN membranes
is so strong that, in the presence of ions, the water permeability
of sNBN@4 is greater than that of sNBN@2, whereas the opposite is
true when dealing with pure water (see Figure 2b). As for sNBN@1, we report in Figure S4
of the Supporting Information the trajectory
of a water molecule and its hydration number in the first shell through
sNBN@4. Contrary to sNBN@1, the water molecule undergoes a loss of
two water molecules during the passage through the sub-nanopore. This
provides a microscopic picture allowing a better understanding of
the improved performance of the sNBN@4 membrane.

(dashed red line). (b) Density profile of ions along the z axis for sNBN@2.

Ion Rejection
We report in Figure 5 the rejection rate of 1 M NaCl solutions
as a function of water permeability for various kinds of membranes.
The rejection rates were calculated from the number of ions and water
molecules crossing the membrane, (1 – coutlet/cinlet) × 100, where coutlet and cinlet are the concentrations in the low- and high-pressure reservoirs,
respectively (see Figure 2a). It is worth mentioning that all simulation results reported
in Figure 5 were obtained
with the same water model, TIP4P/2005, and that additional simulations
performed with another water model (SPC) led to qualitatively similar
results, thus indicating that the conclusions drawn hereafter are
not force field-dependent. For ΔP = 100 MPa,
water permeability for the SPC water model through sNBN@4 was found
to be equal to 4.1 × 10–6 kg·m/m2/h/bar, which is close to the value obtained from TIP4P/2005 (3.9
× 10–6 kg·m/m2/h/bar). The
rejection rates by sNBN@2, sNBN@3, and sNBN@4 were found to be similar
and close to 100% whatever ΔP. It can be explained
by the small pore size of these membranes, which prevents hydrated
ion translocation. Because sNBN@4 has the highest water permeability,
it therefore exhibits the best desalination performance among the
various sNBN membranes under consideration. As shown in Figure 5, water permeability through
sNBN membranes was found to exceed that of usual RO polyamide membranes37 by several orders of magnitude. The water permeabilities
of sNBN@1 and sNBN@4 were even higher than that of nanoporous graphene
(another new promising 2D nanofilter). It should be stressed, however,
that ions were only partially rejected by sNBN@1 because the effective
surface area of hydrated ions (about 38.5 Å2 for Na+) was substantially lower than the sNBN@1 pore surface area
(see Figure 1), thus
allowing ions to be transferred across the membrane, contrary to the
sNBN@2, sNBN@3, and sNBN@4 membranes for which pore surface areas
were smaller than those of hydrated ions. As shown in Figure 4a, sodium cations undergo partial
dehydration when crossing the sNBN@2 membrane. Indeed, the hydration
number of Na+ in the vicinity of the pore entrance is found
to be between 2 and 3, which indicates a substantial dehydration because
the hydration number was found to be 5–6 far from the membrane.
The dehydration process is of course unfavorable from the thermodynamic
point of view, which explains high salt rejection (about 98% for sNBN@2
and almost 100% for both sNBN@3 and sNBN@4). Interestingly, Figure 4a shows that with
sNBN@2, ions dwell in to the nanopore for 6 ns before being translocated.
As shown in Figure 4b, where the profile of densities of ions is plotted, a maximum in
the density of Na+ is shown exactly at the position of
sNBN@4 (z = 0 Å), which shed light on the fact
the ions dwell the nanopore.

Figure 5 Rejection rate of a 1 M NaCl solution by different
membranes vs
water permeability. Data reported for sNBN membranes were obtained
for ΔP = 100 MPa. Surface area of hydrogenated
graphene is about 65.6 Å2. Results on porous graphene
and polyamide membranes were obtained from our own MD simulations.
Force field of polyamide and nanoporous graphene can be found elsewhere.27,37

Conclusions
To
sum up, the present work highlights the outstanding separation
performance of sNBN monolayers. The best performance was obtained
with the sNBN@4 membrane. It results from the combination of a small
pore size with specific interfacial properties, which prevents translocation
of (hydrated) ions while allowing fast water transport due to sliding
of a water wire (single-file transport). Molecular simulations performed
with pure water and sodium chloride solutions allowed us to provide
a microscopic picture of the impact of ions on water permeability
through sNBN membranes. Finally, the energetically unfavorable ion
dehydration was shown to result in high salt rejection. Although the
present results were obtained from molecular simulations, recent experimental
works suggest that large-scale sNBN membranes could be produced with
reasonable efforts. For instance, sNBN membranes could be synthesized
from oxygen-plasma etching16 or by electrically
accentuating the natural defects in BN monolayers (i.e., by taking
advantage of the presence of defects).32,33

Methods
sNBN membranes were made by removing few atoms at the center of
BN monolayer. For sNBN@1 and sNBN@3, hydrogen atoms have been added
to keep the usual valence of carbon. The partial charges on boron
and nitrogen atoms were calculated from the first-principles calculations.
Details of calculations can be found elsewhere38 Partial charges on each pore are given in file FIELD.txt
whereby box dimensions, coordinates, partial charges, and Lennard-Jones
parameters of atoms of four membranes are provided. The sNBN membranes
were considered as rigid. Water was modeled by using the nonpolarizable
rigid TIP4P/2005 model,39 and a nonpolarizable
force field was considered for Na+ and C–.40 Indeed, it has been shown that the
polarizability of Na+ and Cl– had a negligible
impact on both their structure and dynamics properties.41 NEMD simulations were conducted by using two
pistons (graphene walls), on which a given pressure was applied. The
force to be applied on the piston atoms was calculated from the relation F = ΔPS/Np, where ΔP is the pressure difference, S is the piston surface area, and Np is the piston atom number. The sNBN membrane was located
at the center of the simulation box (z = 0 Å)
and was surrounded by two water reservoirs containing 1800 water molecules.
A 1 M NaCl solution (20 Na+ and 20 Cl– ions) was initially located in only one of the two reservoirs. Let
us mention that the solid/liquid interface was along the z direction (see Figure 2a). The flow was therefore along the z direction.
NEMD simulations were stopped when the water density in the inlet
reservoir was constant. To be reproducible, five simulations with
different initial configurations have been considered. During the
pore filling, the number of molecules increases and stabilizes to
reach a plateau with a fluctuation of 5–8 water molecules.
All simulations were carried out with the DLPOLY package (version
4.0)42 using the velocity-Verlet algorithm
in the NVT statistical ensemble, where N is the particle
number, V is the volume, and T is
the temperature. The Berendsen thermostat43 was considered. Periodic boundary conditions were applied in the
three directions. Simulations were performed at T = 300 K using a time step of 0.001 ps to sample 10 ns (acquisition
phase). Electrostatic interactions were truncated at 12 Å and
calculated by using the Ewald sum method with a precision of 10–6. Short-range interactions were modeled by using a
Lennard-Jones potential with a cutoff of 12 Å. Lennard-Jones
interactions between the solid frameworks and water molecules were
taken into account by means of the Lorentz–Berthelot mixing
rule. The coordinates for the various membranes (CONFIG files), the
force field (FIELD files), and the input parameters (CONTROL file)
of simulations are provided. These files are the input files of DL_POLY
software.

The calculation of the contact angle was performed
by depositing
a water droplet on a BN membrane made of four monolayers to compare
with data reported in the literature.34 A water droplet of 2184 molecules (a radius of 22 Å) was carved
from a liquid phase (a system made of 4000 water molecules and simulated
in the isothermal–isobaric statistical ensemble at 1 bar and
298.15 K for 10 ns). After deposit, MD simulations in the canonical
ensemble were performed for 1 ns. Φ was evaluated from the 2D
density profile according to the z and r = (x + y)0.5 directions.34 A value of 55° was found, which is in good
agreement with recent works whereby parameters interactions were optimized34 and then validates the crossed interactions
between BN and water considered in this work.
