Formyl fluoride (HFCO) is an important
atmospheric molecule, and
its reaction with the OH radical is an important pathway when degradation
of HFCO is considered in earth’s troposphere. Here, we study
the hydrolysis of formyl fluoride (HFCO + H2O) with sulfuric
acid (H2SO4) and formic acid (HCOOH) acting
as catalysts by utilizing M06-2X, CCSD(T)-F12a, and conventional transitional
state theory with Eckart tunneling to explore the atmospheric impact
of the above-said hydrolysis reactions. Our calculated results show
that H2SO4 has a remarkably catalytic role in
the gas-phase hydrolysis of HFCO, as the energy barriers of the HFCO
+ H2O reaction are reduced from 39.22 and 41.19 to 0.26
and −0.63 kcal/mol with respect to the separate reactants,
respectively. In addition, we also find that H2SO4 can significantly accelerate the decomposition of FCH(OH)2 into hydrogen fluoride (HF) and HCOOH. This is because while the
barrier height for the unimolecular decomposition of FCH(OH)2 into HF and HCOOH is 31.63 kcal/mol, the barrier height for the
FCH(OH)2 + H2SO4 reaction is predicted
to be −5.99 kcal/mol with respect to separate reactants. Nevertheless,
the comparative relative rate analysis shows that the reaction between
HFCO and the OH radical is still the most dominant pathway when the
tropospheric degradation of HFCO is taken into account and that the
gas-phase hydrolysis of HFCO may only occur with the help of H2SO4 when the atmospheric concentration of OH is
about 101 molecules cm–3 or less. Having
an understanding from the present study that the gas-phase hydrolysis
of HFCO in the presence of H2SO4 has very limited
role possibly in the absence of sunlight, we also prefer here to emphasize
that the HFCO + H2O + H2SO4 reaction
may occur on the surface of secondary organic aerosols for the formation
of HCOOH.

1 Introduction
Formyl
fluoride (HFCO) is a key molecule, produced via atmospheric
degradation of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs)1−7 and hydrofluoroolefins (HFOs).8−10 HFCs have been used as a refrigerant
instead of CFCs and HCFCs to protect the ozone layer.6 Here, HFC-134a is one of the highest concentrations of
HFCs in the atmosphere,11 which mainly
reacts with the OH radical; this leads to the formation of the dominant
intermediate product HFCO.12−15 In recent years, experimental results have shown
that the concentration of HCF-134a has been increasing year by year
due to anthropogenic emission;11,16−23 this leads to the increase of the concentration of HFCO in the atmosphere.
Therefore, it is particularly necessary and important for clarifying
the atmospheric lifetime of HFCO to fully estimate atmospheric environmental
effects of HFCs and HFOs.

The unimolecular reaction of HFCO
and its bimolecular reactions
with atmospheric radicals have been investigated both experimental
and theoretical methods.24−31,33,36 HFCO undergoes unimolecular decomposition and rearrangement reactions
responsible for the formation of hydrogen fluoride (HF), CO, F, HCO,
H, FCO, FCOH, and HCOF. Francisco et al. studied the ground-state
potential energy surface of decomposition and rearrangement reactions
of HFCO by the PMP4SDTQ/6-311++G(d,p)//MP2/6-311G(d,p) method. They
reported a high barrier height of 43.2 kcal/mol for the HFCO →
HF + CO reaction.24 The reaction (HFCO
→ HF + CO) was also calculated by the MP4(SDTQ)/6-311G**//MP2/6-31G*
method with a high barrier height of 46.9 kcal/mol.25,26 In addition, the calculated results have also shown that the barrier
of HFCO decomposition into HF and CO is about 30 kcal/mol lower than
that of the unimolecular rearrangement of HFCO into t-FCOH.27 It is worth noting that the high
barrier heights of HFCO unimolecular decomposition and rearrangement
reactions make these processes negligible in the atmosphere.

HFCO can also react with atmospheric radicals such as OH, Cl, NO3, and HO2. The reaction of HFCO with OH has been
both theoretically and experimentally investigated.28−30 The reported
rate constant for the HFCO + OH reaction is 4 × 10–15 cm3 molecule–1 s–1 at 298 K.31 Hence, the estimated atmospheric
lifetime of HFCO is ∼8 years when the OH radical concentration
is 1 × 106 molecule cm–3 in the
atmosphere.32 Similarly, the rate constant
of the HFCO + Cl reaction is 1.95 × 10–15 cm3 molecule–1 s–1 at 298
K33 and the atmospheric lifetime of HFCO
is estimated to be ∼81 years when the concentration of Cl is
2 × 105 molecule cm–3 (Arctic atmosphere
at noon).34,35 When the concentration of the OH radical
is decreased at night, HFCO may be eliminated by another strong oxidant
NO3.36,37 The rate constant of the HFCO
+ NO3 reaction is 2.09 × 10–23 cm3 molecule–1 s–1,37 and the corresponding atmospheric lifetime of
HFCO is about 1.52 × 105 years at 298 K when nighttime
NO3 concentration is 1 × 1010 molecule
cm–3.38 Additionally,
the rate constant of the HFCO + HO2 reaction is 2.19 ×
10–18 cm3 molecule–1 s–1 at 298 K39 and
the corresponding atmospheric lifetime of HFCO is expected to be ∼13
years when the concentration of HO2 is 1.1 × 109 molecule cm–3.39 The previous results have shown that the HFCO + OH reaction dominates
the sink of HFCO. However, the reaction of HFCO with OH is still quite
slow. Thus, it is expected to further investigate the potential atmospheric
reaction processes for the HFCO sink.

The reaction of HFCO +
H2O has been considered in the
atmosphere. However, the direct reaction of formyl fluoride with H2O has a quite high energy barrier of 43.1 kcal/mol calculated
by MP4/6-311++G**//MP2/6-311G**;40 this
shows that this process is of negligible importance in the atmosphere.
It is seen from both experimental and theoretical investigations that
the atmospheric water and acids can assist the hydrolysis reactions
of various atmospheric molecules in the gas phase,41−55 while hydrolysis reactions play an important role in atmospheric
chemistry. Experimental studies by Vaida and colleagues have shown
that the gas-phase hydrolysis of aldehydes takes place in the presence
of water.41,42 Similarly, theoretical methods have been
used to study the reaction mechanisms and kinetics of the gas-phase
hydrolysis of some species catalyzed by acids in the atmosphere. For
example, theoretical methods were used to investigate the gas-phase
reactions of sulfuric acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of acetaldehyde,43 gas-phase hydrolysis of HCHO assisted by H2SO4, HNO3, and CH3COOH,44,45 and the gas-phase hydrolysis of SO3 catalyzed via HCOOH,
H2SO4, and HNO3.46−49 Thus, further investigation is
expected to show whether the hydrolysis of formyl fluoride can be
feasible in the atmosphere.

In this investigation, the mechanisms
and kinetics of HFCO hydrolysis
reaction catalyzed by sulfuric acid and formic acid have been studied
by quantum chemical methods and conventional transition state theory
with Eckart tunneling. The reactions involved are as follows. R1   R2   R3   R4   R5   R6  

Here, we have found that sulfuric acid
exerts a significantly catalytic
role in the hydrolysis of HFCO and a mechanistic pathway for the formation
of formic acid. However, the comparative relative rate analysis shows
that the gas-phase hydrolysis of HFCO may only occur with the assistance
of H2SO4 when the concentration of OH is about
101 molecules cm–3 or less and that the
HFCO + OH reaction is still the most important dominant pathway for
the sink of HFCO in the atmosphere. Therefore, the present results
should have an understanding of the sink of HFCO and stimulate one
to study the gas-phase hydrolysis of other carbonyl compounds in the
atmosphere.

2 Results and Discussion
We used the
M06-2X/6-311++G(3df,3pd) theoretical method to investigate
the HFCO gas-phase hydrolysis reactions. We report the energy barriers
of HFCO + H2O catalyzed by H2SO4/HCOOH
with zero-point vibrational energies corrected at the CCSD(T)-F12a/cc-pVTZ-F12//M06-2X/6-311++G(3df,3pd)
level of theory in Table S1 (Supporting
Information).

2.1 Gas-Phase Hydrolysis of HFCO
We reinvestigate
the HFCO + H2O reaction to further show the catalytic abilities
of sulfuric acid and formic acid. There are two transition state structures
(TS1A and TS2A) in the HFCO + H2O reaction, as listed in Figure 1. The reaction starts
with the formation of the prereactive complexes C1A and C2A and undergoes
the corresponding transition states TS1A and TS2A responsible for
the formation of FCH(OH)2 in Figure 1, respectively.

Figure 1 Calculated potential
energy profile for the HFCO + H2O reaction with zero-point
vibrational energies corrected at the
CCSD(T)-F12a/cc-pVTZ-F12//M06-2X/6-311++G(3df,3pd) level of theory
(in kcal/mol).

The calculated binding energies
of C1A and C2A are −2.21
and −2.06 kcal/mol with respect to the separate reactants,
respectively. The values of the binding energies of C1A and C2A are
close to the value (−1.62 kcal/mol) of the corresponding prereactive
complex between HCHO and H2O calculated by the CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pv(T+d)z//M06-2X/6-311++G(3df,3pd)
level of theory.44 The energy barriers
of TS1A and TS2A are computed to be 41.43 and 43.25 kcal/mol, respectively,
which compare well with the previously theoretical results of 43.1
kcal/mol calculated by the MP4SDTQ/6-311G**//MP2/6-311G** level40 and 42.1 kcal/mol calculated by the MP2/6-311++G(d,p)
level,56 respectively. The calculated results
again show that the reaction of HFCO + H2O is negligible
in the atmosphere.

2.2 Gas-Phase Hydrolysis of
HFCO Catalyzed by
H2SO4 and HCOOH
When H2SO4 and HCOOH are acted as catalysts, the probability of the
three molecules colliding simultaneously is quite low for the HFCO
+ H2O + H2SO4/HCOOH reaction in the
atmosphere. Therefore, we consider the three possible bimolecular
collisions responsible for the formation of the three possible dimer
species; this leads to the three different entrance channels in each
reaction as listed in eqs R7–R9 and Figures 2–5. R7   R8   R9  

Figure 2 Calculated potential energy profile for the
HFCO + H2O + H2SO4 reaction by sulfuric
acid approaching
the side of F atom in HFCO with zero-point vibrational energies corrected
at the CCSD(T)-F12a/cc-pVTZ-F12//M06-2X/6-311++G(3df,3pd) level of
theory (in kcal/mol).

The mechanism for the
gas-phase hydrolysis of HFCO catalyzed by
H2SO4 is similar to the mechanism for the reaction
of HCHO + H2O catalyzed by H2SO4.43,44 Similarly, the HFCO + H2O + H2SO4 reaction proceeds by stepwise mechanistic pathways. However, a fluorine
atom substitutes one hydrogen atom in HCHO, which results in the loss
of C2v symmetry in HFCO.
Thus, there are two different pathways for the gas-phase hydrolysis
of HFCO catalyzed by H2SO4. One pathway starts
with the formation of the C3A complex before the reaction, goes through
the transition state TS3A to form C3B, and undergoes the subsequent
transition state TS3B responsible for the formation of P3B, as shown
in Figure 2. The other
pathway undergoes a similar process, as shown in Figure 3.

Figure 3 Calculated potential
energy profile for the HFCO + H2O + H2SO4 reaction by sulfuric acid approaching
the side of H atom in HFCO with zero-point vibrational energies corrected
at the CCSD(T)-F12a/cc-pVTZ-F12//M06-2X/6-311++G(3df,3pd) level of
theory (in kcal/mol).

The calculated binding
energy of H2O···H2SO4 is −10.45 kcal/mol, which is consistent
with the value of −10.64 kcal/mol by CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pv(T+d)z//M06-2X/6-311++G(3df,3pd)
reported in the literature.44 The binding
energies of the prereactive complexes C3A and C4A are −10.98
and −13.27 kcal/mol, respectively, which are 7.60 and 5.31
kcal/mol lower than those of the corresponding prereactive complexes
(C21) in the HCHO + H2O + H2SO4 reaction
at the CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pv(T+d)z//M06-2X/6-311++G(3df,3pd) level, respectively.44 C3A and C4A undergo almost a barrierless process,
leading to the formation of the C3B and C4B complexes.

Compared
with the HFCO hydrolysis reaction without the catalyst,
the energy barriers of TS3B and TS4B with respect to C3B and C4B are
reduced to 13.36 and 13.77 kcal/mol from 41.43 and 43.25 kcal/mol,
respectively. However, it is still higher than the energy barrier
of the corresponding transition state in the HCHO + H2O
+ H2SO4 reaction because the energy barrier
of the corresponding transition state in the HCHO + H2O
+ H2SO4 reaction (C22 → TS22) is ∼8.50
kcal/mol.44 Obviously, H2SO4 has a positive effect on reducing the reaction energy barrier
of the HFCO + H2O reaction. It is also shown that H2SO4 has different catalytic effects with different
reactants.

The reaction mechanism for the gas-phase hydrolysis
of HFCO catalyzed
by HCOOH is similar to that of the gas-phase hydrolysis of HFCO catalyzed
by H2SO4 as provided in Figures 4 and 5. Similarly, there are still two different pathways
for the HFCO + H2O + HCOOH reaction. The binding energy
(−7.88 kcal/mol) of the calculated dimer complex H2O···HCOOH is consistent with the values obtained in
the literature, −7.97 kcal/mol by the CCSD(T)/6-311++G(3df,3pd)//MP2/6-311++G(3df,3pd)
level of theory.57 The rate-determining
step of the reaction (HFCO + H2O + HCOOH) is still the
gas-phase hydrolysis of HFCO with a concerted mechanism that H2O molecule is decomposed into OH group and H atom, the H atom
of H2O is transferred to O atom of C=O group in
HCOOH, and the H atom of OH group in HCOOH is migrated to O atom in
HFCO.

+ HCOOH reaction by sulfuric acid approaching the side of H atom
in HFCO with zero-point vibrational energies corrected at the CCSD(T)-F12a/cc-pVTZ-F12//M06-2X/6-311++G(3df,3pd)
level of theory (in kcal/mol).

level of theory (in kcal/mol).

Regarding to the transition states, TS5B and TS6B have energy barriers
of 16.0 and 16.49 kcal/mol to C5B and C6B, respectively. Compared
with the HFCO + H2O reaction without catalyst, the energy
barriers of the HFCO + H2O + HCOOH reaction are decreased
by 25.43 and 26.76 kcal/mol, respectively. However, it is still higher
than the energy barrier of the corresponding transition state in the
HCHO + H2O + HCOOH reaction because the energy barrier
of the corresponding transition state in HCHO + H2O + HCOOH
reaction is ∼9.84 kcal/mol at the MP2/6-311++G(3df,3pd) level
of theory.53

2.3 Unimolecular
Decomposition of FCH(OH)2 Catalyzed by H2SO4 and HCOOH
FCH(OH)2 dominantly decomposes
into HF and HCOOH reported
by Francisco and Williams.40 However, the
energy barrier for the FCH(OH)2 → HF + HCOOH reaction
has been reported to be about 28.6 kcal/mol.40 Thus, the direct decomposition of FCH(OH)2 into HF and
HCOOH is negligible in the atmosphere. Here, the calculated results
indicate that the energy barrier via TS7A (FCH(OH)2 →
HF + HCOOH) is estimated to be 31.63 kcal/mol (see Figure 6).

Figure 6 Calculated potential
energy profile for the decomposition of FCH(OH)2 catalyzed
by H2SO4 and HCOOH with zero-point
vibrational energies corrected at the CCSD(T)-F12a/cc-pVTZ-F12//M06-2X/6-311++G(3df,3pd)
level of theory (in kcal/mol).

As can be seen from Figure 6, the energy barriers for H2SO4 and
HCOOH to catalyze the unimolecular decomposition of FCH(OH)2 into HF and HCOOH are calculated to be −5.99 and 1.18 kcal/mol,
which are reduced by 37.59 and 30.45 kcal/mol, respectively, with
regard to the respectively separate reactants. Therefore, H2SO4 plays a better catalytic role in the unimolecular
decomposition of FCH(OH)2 into HF and HCOOH.

2.4 Reaction Kinetics
The rate constants
of the reactions investigated here were calculated using conventional
transitional state theory with Eckart tunneling at temperatures between
200 and 298 K. We consider different temperatures because there are
different temperatures at different areas in the ground level of earth’s
atmosphere. The reaction in this study involves three molecules, and
the detailed expression of the rate equation is given by taking the
reaction HFCO···H2O + H2SO4 pathway as an example in the Supporting Information. The rates are listed in eqs 1–12. 1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9   10   11   12  

In the above equations, Keq1, Keq2, Keq3, Keq4, and Keq5 refer
to the equilibrium constants of the complexes
HFCO···H2O, H2O···H2SO4, HFCO···H2SO4, H2O···HCOOH, and HFCO···HCOOH,
respectively. k1 is the rate constant
of the bimolecular reaction of HFCO + H2O. The k2′, k2″, and k2‴ represent the bimolecular rate
constants of the HFCO···H2O + H2SO4, HFCO + H2O···H2SO4, and HFCO···H2SO4 + H2O reactions, respectively. k3′, k3″, and k3‴ denote the bimolecular rate constants
of the HFCO···H2O + HCOOH, HFCO + H2O···HCOOH, and HFCO···HCOOH
+ H2O reactions, respectively. k4 is the unimolecular rate constant of FCH(OH)2 decomposition
into HF and HCOOH. k5 and k6 express the bimolecular rate constants of the FCH(OH)2 + H2SO4 and FCH(OH)2 + HCOOH
reactions, respectively. Here, [H2SO4] and [HCOOH]
represent the concentrations of H2SO4 and HCOOH,
which are 4 × 108 molecules cm–358 and 2 × 1011 molecules
cm–3,59 respectively.
We consider the fixed concentrations of H2SO4 and HCOOH only for an understanding of the atmospheric lifetime
of HFCO. We calculated the equilibrium constants, rate constants,
and tunneling for the individual reaction pathway at the temperature
range of 200–298 K, as listed in Tables S2 and S3. In Table S3, it can be
seen that tunneling remarkably accelerate the HFCO + H2O → FCH(OH)2 and FCH(OH)2 → HF
+ HCOOH reactions because the tunneling coefficients are estimated
to be 1011–102, 106–101 at 200–298 K, respectively.

Considering that
there are the three different entrance channels
in the reactions of HFCO + H2O + H2SO4 and HFCO + H2O + HCOOH, respectively, we judge the importance
of the three different entrance channels by the rate ratios as provided
in eqs 13–16. 13   14   15   16  

We calculated the rate ratios
of the three entrance channels for
the HFCO + H2O + H2SO4 reaction and
the rate ratios of the three entrance channels for the HFCO + H2O + HCOOH reaction. The results are listed in Table 1. The rate ratio of v2′ to v2″ is 7.75 × 10–1–9.34
× 10–1 and the rate ratio of v2‴ to v2″ is 2.43 × 10–1–2.49 × 10–1 at the temperature range of 200–298 K; this
shows that the three entrance channels are important for the HFCO
+ H2O + H2SO4 reaction. Therefore, v2 is the sum of the rates of the three entrance
channels. The similar tendency in the HFCO + H2O + HCOOH
reaction is observed because the rate ratio of v3′ to v3″ is 9.70 × 10–1–9.95 × 10–1 and the rate ratio of v3‴ to v3″ is 4.95 × 10–1–4.99 × 10–1 at the temperature range of 200–298 K. Therefore,
the three different entrance channels of the HFCO + H2O
+ HCOOH reaction should be considered and v3 is the sum of the rates of the three entrance channels.

We compare
the HFCO + H2O reaction with the HFCO + H2O
+ H2SO4 and HFCO + H2O
+ HCOOH reactions to estimate the catalytic effects of each catalytic
reactions. The rate ratios are expressed by eqs 17 and 18. 17   18  

The calculated data are
listed in Table 1.
It is worth noting that v2 is 15–8
orders of magnitude higher than v1, while v3 is 11–7
orders of magnitude higher than v1 at
the temperature range of 200–298 K; this again shows that H2SO4 has a remarkably catalytic effect on the HFCO
+ H2O + H2SO4 reaction.

We
consider the rate ratios of v5 to v4 and v6 to v4 as shown in eqs 19 and 20. 19   20  

The calculated
results show that H2SO4 and
HCOOH can effectively catalyze the decomposition of FCH(OH)2 because the rate ratios of v5/v4 and v6/v4 are calculated to be 1015–107 and 1011–104 at the temperature
range of 200–298 K, respectively. Therefore, the calculated
kinetics again shows that H2SO4 can accelerate
the decomposition of FCH(OH)2 responsible for the formation
of formic acid.

2.5 Atmospheric Implications
Previous
studies have shown that the dominant sink of HFCO is its reaction
with OH radical.28,29 Therefore, it is necessary to
compare the hydrolysis of HFCO catalyzed by H2SO4 in the gas phase with the HFCO + OH reaction. The rate ratio is
written in eq 21 21  

kOH is
the rate constant of the HFCO + OH reaction in the atmosphere, which
is an upper limit of 4 × 10–15 cm3 molecule–1 s–1 at 298 K obtained
from experimental results.31 We use the
fixed concentrations of OH and H2O just to understand the
atmospheric lifetime of FCHO. When [OH] is 1 × 106 molecules cm–3 32 and [H2O] is 3.80 × 1017 molecules cm–3,60 the ratio of v2/vOH is about 10–5–10–6 at the temperature
range of 200–298 K; this shows that the reaction between HFCO
and the OH radical is still the most dominant pathway when tropospheric
degradation of HFCO is considered. Furthermore, the calculated atmospheric
lifetime of HFCO with respect to the HFCO hydrolysis reaction in the
presence of H2SO4 is ∼1.26 × 106 years at 298 K (see Table S5)
when the concentrations of H2O and H2SO4 are 3.80 × 1017 molecule cm–3 60 and 4 × 108 molecules cm–3,58 respectively,
which is about 6 orders of magnitude higher than the above-said ∼8
years in the HFCO + OH reaction. Hence, it is negligible for the atmospheric
impact of the gas-phase hydrolysis of HFCO in the presence of H2SO4 in comparison to its reaction with the OH radical.
In general, the concentration of the OH radical is quite high during
both daytime and nighttime.61,62 However, when there
is the absence of sunlight, the concentration of the OH radical in
the troposphere is decreased significantly.63−66 Previous investigations have
shown that the concentration of OH at night is between 0 and 2 ×
105 molecule cm–3.67,68 Thus, it is possible that the concentration of OH is decreased to
be 101 molecule cm–3 at some special
areas. When the concentration is 101 molecule cm–3, the rate ratio of v2/vOH is 2.04 × 100–6.29 × 10–1 at the temperature range of 200–298 K. This
shows that the gas-phase hydrolysis of HFCO can only occur in the
presence of H2SO4 when the atmospheric concentration
of OH is about 101 molecules cm–3 or
less.

The HFCO + H2O + H2SO4 reaction
is also expected to occur on the surface of secondary organic aerosols
(SOAs) in the troposphere to form FCH(OH)2 firstly and then the hydrogen fluoride (HF) and HCOOH
from the decomposition of FCH(OH)2 in the presence of H2SO4 and HCOOH. This is because the gas-phase HFCO
+ H2O + H2SO4 reaction may be more
facile on the surface of secondary organic aerosols (SOAs), as secondary
organic aerosols contain H2SO4, HCOOH, and H2O.69,70 Moreover, some studies have shown
that some atmospheric reactions occur more facilely on the surface
of the secondary organic aerosol (SOA) by the assistance of atmospheric
acids,71 where the H2SO4···H2O complexes exist.69,72 The formed HCOOH can strongly interact with H2SO4 to lead to the formation of the nucleation precursor.70,73,74 Therefore, the HFCO + H2O + H2SO4 reaction may contribute a part to
the formation of secondary organic aerosols.

3 Conclusions
In this article, we have studied the gas-phase
hydrolysis of HFCO
catalyzed by H2SO4 and HCOOH via using quantum
chemical methods and conventional transition state theory with Eckart
tunneling. We have found that H2SO4 has a more
significantly catalytic ability to promote the gas-phase hydrolysis
of HFCO responsible for the formation of FCH(OH)2 and the
decomposition of FCH(OH)2 into HCOOH and HF than HCOOH.
Our results from the comparative rate analysis indicate that the reaction
between HFCO and the OH radical is still the most dominant pathway
for the tropospheric degradations of HFCO and that the gas-phase hydrolysis
of HFCO catalyzed by H2SO4 has a very limited
role possibly in the absence of sunlight. In addition, the hydrolysis
of HFCO catalyzed by H2SO4 may occur on the
surface of secondary organic aerosols (SOAs).

4 Computational
Methods
All of the electronic calculations in this article
were carried
out using Gaussian 0975 and Molpro 2018.76 The geometrical structures of all reactants,
transition states, complexes, and products were optimized by the functional
of M06-2X77 with the 6-311++G(3df,3pd)
basis set.78,79 Previous investigations have
shown that M06-2X/6-311++G(3df,3pd) theoretical method can obtain
more accurate structures and free energies for the atmospheric clusters
with sulfuric acid involved than other methods.80 The frequencies of the optimized structures were computed
at the same theoretical level to show the optimized transition state
with only one imaginary frequency and other stationary points without
imaginary frequencies. Additionally, an intrinsic reaction coordinate81 was used to obtain the reaction path, where
the transition state is connected with the corresponding reactants
and products. To obtain the relative energies more reliably, coupled
cluster theory with single and double excitations and noniterative
triple excitations with the simplified explicit correlation (CCSD(T)-F12a)82,83 theoretical method was used to calculate the single-point energies
of optimized geometries at the cc-pVTZ-F12 basis set based on M06-2X/6-311++G(3df,3pd)
optimized geometries. Finally, the rate constants for each reaction
path were calculated by conventional transition state theory84−86 with Eckart tunneling,87 which executes
using TheRate code.88,89
