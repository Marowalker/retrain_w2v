This
study deals with the synthesis of a gliadin-stabilized gold
quantum cluster (AuQC) for the encapsulation of curcumin (CUR) and
its targeted delivery to the cancer cell. CUR is an anticancer drug
containing a hydrophobic polyphenol derived from the rhizome of Curcuma longa. The utilization of CUR in cancer treatment
is limited because of suboptimal pharmacokinetics and poor bioavailability
at the tumor site. In order to improve the bioavailability of CUR,
we have encapsulated it into AuQCs stabilized by a proline-rich protein
gliadin because proline-rich protein has the ability to bind a hydrophobic
drug CUR. The encapsulation of CUR into the hydrophobic cavity of
the protein was confirmed by various spectroscopic techniques. Compared
to CUR alone, the encapsulated CUR was stable against degradation
and showed higher pH stability up to pH 8.5. The encapsulation efficiency
of CUR in AuQCs was calculated as 98%, which was much higher than
the other reported methods. In vitro drug release experiment exhibited
a controlled and pH-dependent CUR release over a period of 60 h. The
encapsulated CUR-QCs exhibited less toxicity in the normal cell line
(L929) and high toxicity in breast cancer (MDA-MB239). Thus, it can
be used as a potential material for anticancer therapy and bioimaging.

==== Body
Introduction
Cancer is known as
an uncontrolled growth of abnormal cells, and
it is considered as the second leading cause of death globally. The
conventional treatments for cancer diseases are surgery, chemotherapy,
radiotherapy, and hormone therapy.1 The
major challenge of chemotherapy is the nonspecificity of cancer cells,
where normal cells are also drastically affected. The common chemotherapeutic
agents used for the treatment are platinum derivatives, topoisomerase
inhibitors, nucleoside analogues, vinca alkaloids, and taxanes.2,3 These chemotherapeutic agents, though effective in treating cancer,
exhibit severe toxicity in noncancer cells as well.4 Also, most cancer types show initial susceptibility to
chemotherapeutic agents and gain drug resistance through methods such
as drug efflux and DNA mutation, thus increasing the chances of reoccurrence
of the disease and thereby questioning the continued administration
of these drugs.5 Thus, the discovery of
natural phytochemicals with effective growth inhibitory activity in
cancer cells and zero toxicity for normal cell lines has been the
Holy Grail in the research community.

Among the phytochemicals,
curcumin (CUR) [1,7-bis(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)-1,6-heptadiene-3,5-dione]
is a worthy candidate, which is being explored thoroughly. CUR is
a natural hydrophobic polyphenol, isolated from the rhizomes of the
perennial herb Curcuma longa.6 It has drawn significant interest in the recent
past owing to its numerous biological and medicinal activities such
as antimicrobial, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anticarcinogenic,
and neuroprotective properties and is also an inhibitor of angiogenesis.7−9 However, its poor water solubility, high rate of degradation at
the physiological condition, and low oral bioavailability, which is
essentially due to its hydrophobic nature, limit its use in food and
medicine.9 The poor bioavailability of
CUR leads to its low absorption and high rate of metabolism within
the living system and rapid elimination from the biological system.7,10

With this insight, various carrier systems,
such as nanoparticles, liposomes, proteins, polymers, and so forth,
have been devised for the encapsulation of CUR.10 In recent times, several research groups have used biocompatible
nanomaterials as drug carriers for targeted therapy. One of the important
nanomaterials used as carriers is metal nanoparticles, and among them,
gold quantum clusters have specifically raised interest among scientists.11,12 They are a subnanometer core-sized particle made up of several tens of atoms,
which shows molecule-like optical properties.13 Recently, Govindaraju and co-workers developed CUR-conjugated fluorescent
gold nanoclusters for anticancer therapy.14 The excellent properties of gliadin-stabilized gold quantum clusters
(AuQCs), such as easy one-pot synthesis, intensive fluorescence, good
aqueous solubility, excellent biocompatibility, extraordinary photostability,
extremely small size, and low cytotoxicity, make them a suitable candidate
for bioimaging and drug delivery.15

Herein, we selected an abundant, low-cost, and sustainable plant
protein—wheat gliadin—employed as a reducing as well
as stabilizing agent to facilely produce AuQC and exhibit a strong
red fluorescence. Gliadin is a proline and glutamine-rich monomeric
protein component of wheat gluten and has a high amount of nonpolar
amino acids in its primary structure.16 It is well known that the proline-rich proteins have the ability
to bind hydrophobic drugs, which allow mediated and controlled drug
release.17,18 Thus, herein, we have used a gliadin-protected
gold quantum cluster for enhanced solubilization of CUR in an aqueous
medium, which exhibits excellent stability at the physiological condition.
The AuQC–CUR shows significant results in both bioimaging and
anticancer therapy, which suggest its great potential for anticancer
treatment.

Experimental Section
Materials
The chemicals, HAuCl4·3H2O, gliadin, folic acid (FA), 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide
(EDC), N-hydroxy succinimide (NHS), and the membrane
dialysis bag (molecular weight cutoff 14 kDa), were purchased from
Sigma-Aldrich. Sodium dihydrogen phosphate, sodium hydroxide, and
disodium hydrogen phosphate were purchased from Merck. CUR was gifted
by Synthite Industries, Kerala, India. All solutions were prepared
using Millipore water.

Instrumentation
The absorption spectra
were taken using
a Varian model Cary wins Bio 100 spectrometer in the range of 200–800
nm. The fluorescence emission spectra were recorded using the Fluoro
Max-4C spectrofluorometer (Horiba Instruments, USA). The slits for
excitation and emission were set at 5 nm. Lifetime analysis was measured
using time-correlated single photon counting with a pulse width of
1.3 ns. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images
were recorded on a JEOL JEM 2100 instrument with an acceleration voltage
of 200 kV. An Omicron ESCA Probe spectrometer with unmonochromatized
Mg Kα X-rays was used for X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)
analysis. Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectra were recorded
using a PerkinElmer FTIR spectrometer. Thermal transition measurements
were done using a TA Q100-DSC thermal analyzer (TA Instruments, New
Castle, Delaware 19720 USA).

Synthesis of AuQC@Gliadin
Synthesis
of AuQC@gliadin
is briefly explained herein. Gliadin (25 mg/mL) protein powder was
dissolved in 0.25 M NaOH solution and heated at 40 °C for 15
min. The above prepared gliadin solution (5 mL) was treated with 5
mL (5 mM) of AuCl4 and vigorously stirred at 55 °C
for 3 h. Purification of AuQC@gliadin was performed by dialysis against
distilled water for 24 h in a dialysis membrane with a molecular weight
cutoff of 14 kDa. The cleaned gold clusters were then freeze-dried
and stored at room temperature for further use.

Loading of
CUR
The AuQC@gliadin stock solution (5%,
w/v) was prepared by dispersing the freeze-dried AuQC@gliadin sample
in water. CUR stock solution (4 mg/mL) was prepared
in distilled ethanol, and 14 μL of CUR solution was added dropwise
per milliliter of AuQC@gliadin under stirring at room temperature.
The CUR solution was immediately solubilized in AuQC@gliadin solution,
resulting in a bright yellow solution, which is distinct from the
golden-yellow solution of AuQC@gliadin. The stirring was continued
for 30 min to stabilize the formulation. The unbound CUR was removed
by centrifugation at 10 000 rpm for 10 min. The resultant supernatants
were then collected, freeze-dried, and stored at room temperature
for further use.

Preparation of the FA-Functionalized AuQC@Gliadin–CUR
Conjugate
Conjugation of CUR with protein-stabilized AuQC
was carried out by the EDC/NHS coupling reaction.19 An aqueous solution (0.05 M, 0.25 mL) of EDC was treated
with 5 mL (1 mg/mL) of AuQC@gliadin and kept stirring for 2 h. To
this, 0.25 mL of 0.05 M aqueous solution of NHS was added, followed
by the addition of 150 μL of 4 mM FA. After 12 h of continuous
reaction, the reaction mixture was centrifuged at 15 000 rpm
for 15 min in a 1:1 methanol/2-propanol mixture, followed by washing
with DI water twice to obtain FL-AuQC@gliadin. To this solution, 200
μL of CUR stock solution was added, followed by continuous stirring
for 30 min to get the FA-AuQC@gliadin–CUR conjugate.

Calculation
of Encapsulation Efficiency
Encapsulation
efficiency (EE) of CUR bound to AuQC@gliadin was determined by adding
200 μL of CUR stock solution in 10 mL of solution of AuQC@gliadin
and kept stirring for 30 min at room temperature. The solution was
centrifuged for 10 min at 10 000 rpm to pelletize the undissolved
CUR. The pellet was carefully dissolved in a known amount of ethanol,
and CUR was quantified spectrophotometrically at 428 nm. The EE was
calculated based on eq 1.20 1  

In Vitro Release
of CUR
Direct dispersion method was
employed to study the in vitro drug release of CUR from AuQC@gliadin–CUR.21−23 A known quantity of CUR-loaded AuQCs was taken in 3 mL of 0.1 M
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at pH 5 and 7.4 and incubated in a
water bath shaker at 37 °C. This study was carried out for a
time period of 60 h where the tubes were taken out at definite time
intervals and centrifuged at 10 000 rpm for 10 min. This was
done in order to pelletize the released drug, while the entrapped
drug within the gold quantum cluster remained in the supernatant.
Subsequently, the pellets were dissolved in 3 mL of ethanol, and the
amount of CUR released was quantified using a spectrometer at a wavelength
of 428 nm.

Cell Culture
C6 cells were cultured
in the F-12K basal
medium and MDA-MB231 and L929 cells in Dulbecco’s modified
Eagle’s medium, which were supplemented with 10% fetal bovine
serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. The cells were incubated at
37 °C for 24 h with 5% CO2 and were observed for healthy
growth after incubation. On reaching 80–90% confluency, they
were trypsinized using trypsin–EDTA solution (0.25% w/v trypsin,
0.54 mM EDTA) to detach them from the flask and centrifuged at 3000
rpm for 3 min. The cells were then resuspended in the medium for further
studies.

Cytotoxicity Assay
To evaluate the cytotoxicity of
the prepared formulation, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazole-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl
tetrazolium (MTT) assay was performed. It is a colorimetric test based
on the selective ability of viable cells to reduce the tetrazolium
component of MTT into formazan crystals, which is purple in color.24 For cytotoxicity experiments, MDA-MB 231 and
L929 cells were seeded on a 96-well plate and incubated at 37 °C
for 24 h. Subsequently, both the cell lines were added with four different
concentrations (25, 50, 100, 200 μg) of FA-conjugated AuQC@gliadin–CUR.
After the incubation of FA-AuQC@gliadin–CUR in serum-free media
for 24 h, the media were replaced with 90 μL of fresh media,
followed by the addition of 10 μL (5 mg/mL) MTT reagent. The
media were removed after 4 h incubation at 37 °C. Dimethyl sulfoxide
(100 μL) was then added to the wells and incubated for 30 min.
The optical density of the solutions was then determined at 570 nm
using a microplate reader. The data were plotted against the concentration
of FA-AuQC@gliadin–CUR versus relative cell viability (%).

Cellular Uptake Studies
Cellular uptake studies were
done to monitor the relative uptake of FA-AuQC@gliadin–CUR
in different cell lines and also to standardize the time required
for the maximum uptake of the formulation by the cells. The study
was done in L929 (normal cell line), C6 glioma (brain cancer cell),
and MDA-MB231 (breast cancer) cells. These cells were cultured as
described above and were seeded into four-well dishes. The cells were
incubated at 37 °C for 24 h so that they can attach to the well.
Followed by incubation, the cell lines were treated with 100 μg
of FA-AuQC@gliadin–CUR at three different time point incubations
(1, 2, and 4 h). After each time point of incubation, the cells were
fixed using 4% paraformaldehyde solution and were mounded on glass
slides. The cellular uptake and the fluorescence property of the FA-conjugated
AuQC@gliadin–CUR were observed with HcRed and fluorescein isothiocyanate
using a confocal microscope.

Stability Measurements
Stability of the prepared formulation
in various pH (5, 6, 7, 7.4, 8.6, and 9) buffers was studied spectrophotometrically.
In order to study the stability of the conjugate at pH 7.4 with time,
CUR and AuQC@gliadin–CUR were dispersed in phosphate buffer
and incubated at room temperature. The concentration of CUR at different
time intervals was calculated by measuring the absorbance at 428 nm.

Results and Discussion
Characterization of AuQC@gliadin
The method for the
synthesis of AuQC@gliadin is similar to our previous method for the
synthesis of gluten-protected AuQC.25 Gliadin-protected
AuQC was synthesized by in situ reduction of chloroauric acid. Spectroscopic
and microscopic techniques were used to confirm the successful formation
of AuQC@gliadin. The UV–visible absorption and emission spectrum
of AuQC@gliadin are shown in Figure 2.

AuQC.

Figure 2 (A) Optical absorption (black trace) and emission

UV light and (ii) visible light. (B) TEM images of AuQC@gliadin. The
inset shows the HRTEM image of AuQC@gliadin in the scale of 2 nm;
(C) SAED pattern of AuQC@gliadin; and (D) binding energy of AuQC@gliadin
determined from XPS.

AuQC@gliadin showed a characteristic broad featureless absorption
peak with a small hump at 280 nm, which is due to the presence of
aromatic amino acid present in gliadin as AuQC@gluten (Figure 2A).25−27 The possibility
of Au nanoparticle formation was eliminated as the surface plasmon
resonance peak was not visible at around 520 nm. At an excitation
of 380 nm, the fluorescence spectra of the formed cluster showed an
emission maximum centered at 685 nm along with a weak emission peak
around 460 nm, which is due to the aromatic amino acid present in
gliadin (Figure 2A).
The formed cluster showed an intense red emission under UV light (365
nm) [inset of Figure 2A(i)] and light brown color under visible light [inset of Figure 2B(ii)]. TEM image
and XPS analysis further confirmed the formation of AuQC. The TEM
image of AuQC@gliadin (Figure 2B) demonstrated that the as-prepared AuQC has good monodispersity
with a particle size of ∼2 nm. The hydrodynamic volume of AuQC@gliadin
was analyzed using the dynamic light scattering (DLS) technique. The
average size of AuQC@gliadin was found to be 60 ± 2 nm (Figure S1).

HRTEM and selected area electron
diffraction (SAED) pattern demonstrated
the crystallinity of the as-formed QCs. XPS determined the binding
energy for Au 4f7/2 and 4f5/2 of AuQC@gliadin
to be 84.5 and 88.1 eV, respectively, which corresponds to Au(0).
This confirmed the reduction of Au(III) to Au(0) after the formation
of clusters (Figure 2B).

Characterization of AuQC@Gliadin–CUR
Simple
one-step mixing method was used for the loading of CUR into AuQC@gliadin
to form the AuQC@gliadin–CUR hybrid. The schematic representation
for the encapsulation of CUR into AuQC@gliadin is illustrated in Figure 1. The EE of CUR in
AuQC@gliadin was calculated and found to be 98.17 ± 0.25%. The
formed AuQC@gliadin–CUR hybrid was then lyophilized and resuspended
in water. It was found that the lyophilized powder of the AuQC@gliadin–CUR
hybrid showed a complete dispersion in an aqueous medium (Figure 3b, inset), whereas
CUR alone remained completely insoluble in water with undissolved
flakes clearly visible in the suspension (Figure 3b inset). The photophysical studies of AuQC@gliadin
and the hybrid have been carried out to understand the interaction
of CUR with AuQC@gliadin. Noticeable changes in the absorption and
fluorescence spectra of CUR and AuQC@gliadin were observed after interaction
of these two entities. Figure 3A,B shows the UV–vis absorption and emission spectra
of AuQC@gliadin with different concentrations of CUR. CUR alone showed
an absorption peak at 428 nm in the aqueous buffer, which is the signature
of its basic diaryl heptanoic chromophore group.28 The inclusion of CUR in AuQC@gliadin showed the broadening
with a slight blue shift in the absorption peak and a noticeable increase
in the absorption intensity (Figure 3A). The blue shift in the absorption maxima suggests
the nonpolar vicinity of the CUR molecules.29,30 Upon addition of CUR to AuQC@gliadin, noticeable changes in the
fluorescence intensity and peak position at 480 nm of QC were observed.
On addition of increasing concentration of CUR to QC, the broadening
of the emission peak at 480 nm and its complete shifting to 505 nm
were noticed, which corresponds to CUR emission (Figure 3B).

Figure 3 (A,B) Respective absorption
and emission spectra of AuQC@gliadin
with different concentrations of CUR (4.4 μM to 36.4 μM).
The inset of (A) shows (a) CUR in AuQC@gliadin and (b) CUR in water;
(C,D) respective absorption and emission spectra of CUR with different
volumes of AuQC@gliadin (100 μL to 800 μL).

CUR alone in buffer showed a weak broad fluorescence
peak at 570
nm when excited at 430 nm (black trace of Figure 3D).The blue shift in the emission spectrum
of CUR from 570 to 505 nm is due to the entrapment of CUR in AuQC@gliadin.
Previous reports for the interaction of CUR with proteins support
this observation.30−32 The binding of CUR to bovine serum albumin, human
serum albumin ,and soy protein isolate showed fluorescence maxima
at 510, 515, and 500 nm, respectively.30−32 CUR is known to bind
to the hydrophobic domain of the protein molecules and this nonpolar
environment of CUR in AuQC@gliadin is held responsible for the blue
shift in its emission maxima.30,31,33,34 Moreover, the interaction of
CUR with AuQC@gliadin can be confirmed by the progressive reduction
in fluorescence intensity at 680 nm on addition of increasing concentrations
of CUR (Figure 3B).

Similarly, the enhanced solubilization of CUR in an aqueous solution
of AuQC@gliadin was demonstrated by monitoring the absorption and
emission spectra of CUR with various concentrations of AuQC@gliadin.
The absorption and emission spectra of CUR at different volumes of
AuQC@gliadin are shown in Figure 3C,D. On addition of increasing volume of AuQC@gliadin
to CUR in the buffer, remarkable changes were observed in the absorption
and fluorescence spectra of CUR. The increase in absorption intensity
at 428 nm along with the broadening in the absorption peak confirmed
the improved solubility of CUR in the gold quantum cluster solution.
Moreover, the addition of AuQC@gliadin greatly improved the fluorescence
intensity of CUR at 505 nm, compared to that in an aqueous medium,
together with the blue shift from 575 to 505 nm in the fluorescence
peak, which suggests that CUR in AuQC@gliadin binds to the hydrophobic
pockets of the protein and thus experiences a nonpolar environment.
The fluorescence lifetime analysis further supported the encapsulation
of CUR in protein-stabilized AuQCs. The fluorescence decays of CUR,
AuQC@gliadin, and AuQC@gliadin–CUR were recorded with an excitation
wavelength of 405 nm, and the fluorescence decays were monitored to
their emission maxima (Figure 4).

Figure 4 (A) Lifetime
of AuQC@gliadin and AuQC@gliadin–CUR at 680
nm emission and (B) lifetime of CUR and AuQC@gliadin–CUR at
550 nm emission.

All the lifetime values
were obtained by fitting the fluorescence
decay curves biexponentially, as tabulated in Table 1. When comparing the average lifetime of
CUR and encapsulated CUR, the encapsulated CUR shows increased average
lifetime value.

Table 1 Lifetime Data of AuQC@Gliadin, AuQC@Gliadin–CUR,
and CUR
sample name	A1	τ1 (ns)	A2	τ2 (ns)	χ2	τav (ns)	
CUR (550 nm)	14.96	6.84	85.04	1.48	1.37	3.88	
AuQC@gliadin–CUR (550 nm)	43.74	2.16	56.26	8.2	1.37	7.17	
AuQC@gliadin (680 nm)	84.74	60.25	59.69	3.29	1.39	59.69	
AuQC@gliadin–CUR (680 nm)	78.78	44.5	21.22	2.68	1.1	43.83	
The increased value
of the average lifetime is due to the entrapment
of CUR in the hydrophobic pockets of the protein, which disrupt the
excited-state intramolecular proton-transfer process, whereas the
average lifetime of AuQC@gliadin decreased when CUR was introduced,
which is due to the interaction of CUR with QCs.

The FTIR analysis
was carried out to understand the conformation
changes of the protein after incorporation of CUR. Figure 5A shows the FTIR spectra of
(i) AuQC@gliadin (black), (ii) AuQC@gliadin–CUR (blue), and
(iii) CUR (red). The secondary structure of gliadin was described
by the protein amide I band at 1600–1690 cm–1 (due to C–O stretching) and amide II band at 1480–1575
cm–1 (C–N stretch coupled with the N–H
bending mode).35,36 Noncovalent interactions such
as van der Waals interactions, hydrophobic interactions, and hydrogen
bonds are generally known to lower the energy of the corresponding
part of the molecule, reduce the force constants of the bonds, and
therefore decrease its absorption frequency.37

Figure 5 (A)
FTIR spectra, (B) TGA, and (C) DSC analysis of AuQC@gliadin,
CUR, and AuQC@gliadin–CUR, respectively.

After interaction with CUR, the peak corresponding to amide
I shifted
to lower wavenumber from 1633 to 1630 cm–1 and the
amide II band shifted from 1536 to 1528 cm–1. This
shift in wavenumber resulted from the binding of CUR to the protein
C=O, C–N, and N–H groups. The N–H stretching
frequency of gliadin is decreased from 3280 to 3278 cm–1 because of the interaction of CUR with the N–H groups of
the protein.38 Moreover, the decrease in
signal intensity of the amide bands of the protein furthermore suggested
the changes in the protein conformational states upon interaction
with CUR.38 CUR has its phenolic −OH
stretching peak at 3504 cm–1 and its other characteristic
bands at 1027/857 cm–1 (C–O–C stretching),
1275 cm–1(aromatic C–O stretching), 1428
cm–1 (olefinic C–H bending), 1502 cm–1 (C=O and C=C vibrations) and at 1602
cm–1 stretching vibrations of the benzene ring.
These peaks were attenuated in the AuQC@gliadin–CUR spectrum
because of the higher bandwidth of protein bands, which suggests that
CUR is located within the macromolecular protein moiety by van der
Waals forces and hydrophobic interactions. Thermal analysis of AuQC@gliadin,
CUR, and AuQC@gliadin–CUR was carried out to understand the
changes in the thermal behavior of AuQC@gliadin after incorporation
of CUR. Figure 5B,C
shows the thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning
calorimetry (DSC) analysis of AuQC@gliadin, CUR, and AuQC@gliadin–CUR.

The thermogravimetric curves of AuQC@gliadin and CUR-loaded AuQC
demonstrated the first stage weight loss by the gliadin samples at
around 100 °C because of moisture loss at increasing temperature.39 The second stage weight loss resulted from the
decomposition of gliadin at 246 °C in AuQC@gliadin and 249 °C
in AuQC@gliadin–CUR. This shift in decomposition temperature
is attributed to the incorporation of CUR to AuQC@gliadin and implies
the enhanced stability of AuQC@gliadin after CUR incorporation. The
TGA curve for pure CUR showed a rapid weight loss of around 260 °C,
which may be attributed to the decomposition of substituent groups
of CUR.40

The DSC thermograms of
AuQC@gliadin showed an endothermic peak
at 77 °C because of the unfolding and denaturization of the protein.39 The incorporation of CUR increased the thermal
stability of gliadin in AuQC as the denaturization temperature shifted
to a higher temperature of 92 °C in the case of AuQC@gliadin–CUR.
The DSC of CUR alone shows an endothermic peak at 183 °C, which
corresponds to the melting of CUR.41 The
endothermic peak of CUR was absent in the conjugate, which confirms
the molecular incorporation of CUR in AuQC.

Stability of CUR
As mentioned earlier, CUR has very
little solubility in water and is chemically unstable under physiological
conditions, which is a major issue that concerns its bioavailability.42 It is well known that CUR is highly unstable
at physiological pH and undergoes rapid degradation into different
products such as bicyclopentadione, vanillin, and ferulic acid.43 It is reported that the binding of CUR to the
hydrophobic pockets of protein can greatly improve solubilization
and arrest its degradation.32,44 In order to investigate
the stability/biodegradability of CUR, the changes of the relative
intensity of the characteristic absorption maximum of CUR in physiological
condition were measured as a function of time (Figure 6). The absorption peak at 428 nm of free
CUR showed a rapid degradation in PBS solution with only 60% of CUR
remaining after 12 h of incubation, whereas in the case of encapsulated
CUR, the absorption peak showed remarkable stability under the same
condition, with more than 92% of CUR remaining even after 12 h of
incubation (Figure 6A). Similarly, we have analyzed the stability of the encapsulated
CUR in different pH conditions. Figure 6B shows the absorption spectrum of AuQC@gliadin–CUR
at different pH ranging from 5 to 9. The inset shows the photographs
of the AuQC@gliadin–CUR solution in different buffers. The
entrapped CUR is highly stable from pH 5 to 8.6, indicating the protection
of CUR from hydrolytic degradation.

Figure 6 (A) Plot showing the stability of AuQC@gliadin–CUR
and CUR
in aqueous buffer pH 7.4 and (B) absorption spectra indicating the
pH stability of AuQC@gliadin–CUR at pH 5, 6, 7, 7.4, 8.6, and
9.

At pH 9, a slight blue shift of
the maximum absorption wavelength
with a decrease in absorbance was observed, which is due to the degradation
of CUR in more alkaline condition. Thus, the hybrid developed in this
study shows superior stability over many reported formulations.9,45−48

In Vitro Release of CUR from AuQC@Gliadin–CUR
Before
checking the anticancer activity of the drug-loaded quantum
cluster, in vitro release kinetics was studied using UV–vis
spectroscopy. The study was carried out with PBS at pH 5 and 7.4.
The percentage of drug released from AuQC@gliadin–CUR at predetermined
time intervals was calculated using the standard curve prepared for
CUR. Figure 7 shows
the in vitro drug release profile of AuQC@gliadin–CUR at pH
5 and 7.4. The in vitro dug release profile shows that CUR release
was more at pH 5 compared with that at pH 4. A sustained release of
CUR was observed after the initial burst release, and 97.8% of the
encapsulated CUR was released at pH 5 within 60 h. The initial burst
release could be due to the attached CUR molecules on the surface
of the AuQCs and the sustained release from the entrapped CUR.21 In pH 7.4, the total release was only 35.4%
at the same time, and the results indicated that the release of CUR
was slower at physiological pH than under acidic condition. Because
the cancer cells have an acidic extracellular environment, the release
of CUR at acidic (pH ≈ 5) is more suitable for cancer therapy
and noncancer cells at physiological pH are likely to be least affected
by our formulation. The higher release rate CUR at acidic pH could
be the conformational changes of gliadin at this pH, which facilitate
enhanced CUR release.

CUR from
AuQC@gliadin–CUR over 60 h at pH 5 and 7.4.

Characterization of Folate-Conjugated AuQC@Gliadin–CUR
FA has been conjugated to AuQC@gliadin for targeted delivery of
CUR to the cancer cell because the membrane-associated FA receptor
is overexpressed in cancer cells but remains at a very low level in
most normal tissues.49 FA-AuQC@gliadin–CUR
was formed by chemically linking FA to the protein via EDC/NHS coupling.
The conjugation of FA was confirmed by FTIR spectroscopy and UV–vis
absorption study. Figure 8A,B shows the respective absorption and FTIR spectra of FA
and FA-AuQC@gliadin–CUR, respectively. The absorption spectrum
of FA-AuQC@gliadin–CUR shows three characteristic peaks at
282, 361, and 420 nm. The peaks at 282 and 361 nm are accorded with
the characteristic absorbance of FA, and the absorbance at 420 nm
is originated from CUR. This indicates that FA was successfully conjugated
with AuQC@gliadin. Further conjugation of FA toward QC was confirmed
by FTIR spectroscopy. The FTIR spectra of FA showed characteristic
peaks at 3538 and 3413 cm–1 because of the stretching
of −OH and −NH of the glutamic acid and pterinic portion,
respectively.50 Also, the peak at 1690
cm–1 corresponded to the stretching of different
−C=O groups and the band at 1604 cm–1 resulted from −NH bending. Moreover, the band at 1482 cm–1 has arisen from the vibration of the pterinic group.51 On inspecting the spectra of FA-AuQC@gliadin–CUR,
the successful conjugation of FA to AuQC@gliadin–CUR was confirmed.
As evident from Figure 8B, the −OH stretching peak of FA at 3538 cm–1 and the NH stretching at 3413 cm–1 with an increase
in intensity could be found in the FTIR spectra of FA-AuQC@gliadin–CUR
because of the overlapping of these functional groups with those in
AuQC@gliadin–CUR. A shift in wavenumber of the amide I group
(C–O stretch) from 1630 to 1636 cm–1 was
observed on conjugation of FA to AuQC@gliadin–CUR. The amide
II band of AuQC@gliadin–CUR also showed a shift from 1528 to
1535 cm–1, which is attributed to the newly formed
C–N bond.50

In Vitro Cytotoxicity to
Normal and Cancer Cells
It
is necessary to evaluate the toxicity profile of a nanoprobe for biomedical
applications. To evaluate the cytotoxicity of FA-AuQC@gliadin–CUR,
we have treated L929-normal cell line and MDA-MB231 breast cancer
cells to a series of equivalent concentrations of the nanoprobe for
24 h, and the percentage of viable cells was quantified by the use
of the MTT assay (Figure 9). The results from the MTT assay showed that AuQC@gliadin-FA–CUR
exerts a significant concentration-dependent cytotoxicity to MDA-MB
231 cells and at the same time it is least toxic to the normal cell
line—L929. This further supports the targeted delivery of CUR
to the cancer cell without affecting normal cells and indicates that
CUR remains active even after conjugation with AuQC@gliadin.

Figure 9 Cytotoxicity
studies by the MTT assay in (A) L929 cell line and
(B) MDA-MB-231 cell line.

Herein compared to cancer cells, normal cells are also slightly
affected because the immortalized cells cannot sustain continuous
treatment for 24 h, and this could also be a governing factor for
the unexpected cell death in these cell lines. Moreover, normal cell
lines show significant expression of folate receptors and though not
overexpressed as these cell lines, there are still distributions of
the folate receptors among normal cell lines.52 The least toxicity of L929 cells with that of MDA-MB231 may be attributed
to the presence of these folate receptors in the normal cells which
on prolonged exposure (24 h) of FA-AuQC@gliadin–CUR may have
facilitated its uptake.

There are several reports on the cytotoxic
effects of CUR in several
types of cancers and mechanisms by which they act.53,54 In C6 cells, CUR is known to reduce the cell survival in a p53-
and caspase-independent manner, which is an effect correlated with
the inhibition of AP-1 and NFB signaling pathways,55 whereas in MDA-MB-231 cells, apoptosis is induced through
the regulation of ROS.56 Thus, AuQC@gliadin
as a CUR carrier is reassuring to the cancer treatment regime because
of its ability to administer CUR without the loss of its medicinal
efficacy.

Cellular Uptake of FA-AuQC@Gliadin–CUR
The in
vitro cellular uptake studies via confocal fluorescent imaging were
done after first, second, and fourth hour of incubation, and the images
are shown in Figures 10, 11, and S2. On
analyzing the uptake intensities of all the three cell lines, it is
confirmed that maximum uptake was observed in the cancer cells after
4 h of incubation. It is long known that nanotechnology-driven drug
delivery systems enhance the delivery to targeted cancer cells by
benefitting from the unique vasculature characteristics of tumors.57 L929 cells (normal cell line) showed no fluorescence
at 4 h compared to C6 and MDA-MB231 (cancer cell lines) suggesting
minimal to zero uptake of the formulation by these cells. This makes
AuQC@gliadin a felicitous CUR carrier because the undesirable effects
of traditional chemotherapeutic agents may be overcome as it augments
its availability at the tumor site alone with least damage on healthy
tissues. Also, a gradual increase in the fluorescence intensity was
observed with the increase in incubation time (from 1 to 4 h) in cancer
cells. The morphological changes in the cells after treatment with
FA-AuQC@gliadin–CUR have been inspected by microscopic observation.
Compared to L929 cells, both C6 and MDA-MB231 cells have undergone
obvious morphological changes as is evident from Figures 10, 11, and S2. With an increase in incubation
time, there was a retraction of cellular processes with appearance
of common apoptotic features such as cell shrinkage, membrane blebbing,
rounding, and so forth. Also, disintegration of the cancer cells was
at its peak at 4 h of incubation, and more cells detached from the
substratum leaving only a few attached. This confirms the selective
toxicity of our conjugate in cancer cell lines.

Conclusions
We have synthesized
a gliadin-protected gold quantum cluster using
a simple one-pot synthesis strategy and have effectively conjugated
CUR to the cluster through instant mixing. Optical and thermal studies,
microscopic analysis, EE, in vitro drug release, cellular uptake,
and cytotoxicity of the prepared formulation were performed. The EE
of CUR was 98.37 ± 0.25%, and the release study showed 97.8%
release of the drug within 60 h in pH 5. The cellular uptake studies
also demonstrated maximum uptake by C6 and MDA-MBA-231 cells and minimum
uptake by L929 cells. Poor bioavailability upon oral administration
and lack of absorption restricts the therapeutic application of hydrophobic
and nearly water-insoluble CUR. Despite their phenomenal anticancer
activity, many pharmaceutical companies refrain from using them as
such owing to the fact that they form drug aggregates in highly localized
concentrations at the sites of their deposition. This remains tantalizing
to the scientific community knowing how active these compounds are
toward their molecular targets. CUR, which falls into this category
of compounds, is in dire need for a suitable carrier system to overcome
these limitations without compromising its activity which AuQC@gliadin
is expected to fulfill.
