Understanding the
self-assembly of cluster aggregates remains an
important challenge in coordination chemistry. A chelating tetrazine-based
ligand was employed to isolate an unprecedented tetranuclear Hg4 complex exhibiting HgI/HgII mixed valence,
which also contains metal–metal bonds. Single-crystal X-ray
diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, solid-state nuclear
magnetic resonance, and theoretical approaches (density functional
theory) were employed to shed some light on the structure and self-assembly
of this discrete molecule.

Introduction
Coordination cluster
aggregates formed via self-assembly continue
to attract attention from the scientific community for their aesthetic
beauty, complexity, and intrinsic physical properties.1 A large number of such molecules have been reported over
the past few decades with various nuclearities and sizes, some of
which even rivals small nanoparticles in size.2 In the synthesis of molecular cluster aggregates, serendipity plays
a significant role. However, directed self-assembly can be used for
small nuclearity complexes, thanks to carefully designed ligand scaffolds
and careful control of reaction conditions.3 First and foremost, organic ligands can act as chelates and bind
to metal ions, but they can also become templates, bridging units,
and/or electron reservoirs. Ligands can also play a symbiotic relationship
with metal ions by sharing electrons and stabilizing the unstable
oxidation states of metal ions. Since the discovery of coordination
complexes, chemists have continued to create new systems with tailored
properties through carefully designed ligand frameworks. With that
said, serendipitous formation of unexpected complexes continues to
fascinate researchers, as discovering their formation provides unique
opportunities to understand the self-assembly process and target the
desired molecules.

To that end, tetrazines have shown tremendous
potential in coordination
chemistry as they can effectively bind to multiple metal ions while
also acting as bridging units and electron reservoirs.3a,3c Furthermore, the redox properties of tetrazines have proven ideal
for providing strong exchange-coupling pathways in magnetic materials.
Indeed, under certain synthetic conditions, a metal-assisted ring
opening of the tetrazine ring can be observed, leading to unpredicted
structures.4

As an element, mercury
displays unique structural features upon
coordination. The Hg–Hg bond has been studied for decades and
was the first metal–metal bond uncovered for group 12 elements.
Mercury has a large ionization energy due to relativistic stabilization
of the 6s orbital, resulting in strong Hg–Hg bonds.5 However, because of instability, most metal–metal
bonded complexes were isolated under an inert atmosphere using the
organometallic approach.6 Although mixed
oxidation states of Hg-based compounds exist, they are relatively
rare in coordination compounds.7 With this
in mind, we have focused our attention on the coordination chemistry
of Hg complexes using the tetrazine-based 3,6-di(pyrimidin-2-yl)-1,2,4,5-tetrazine
(BpymTz) ligand. As such, we aim to promote the self-assembly of coordination
cluster aggregates through the use of multidentate tetrazine and investigate
their structural formation. Herein, we present a tetranuclear {Hg4} coordination complex with unique structural features, such
as Hg–Hg bond formation as well as mixed HgI/HgII oxidations states.

Results
and Discussion
The reaction of Hg(CH3COO)2·6H2O (4 equiv) with 3,6-di(pyrimidin-2-yl)-1,2,4,5-tetrazine
(BpymTz)
(2 equiv) in N,N-dimethylformamide
(DMF) gives a clear orange solution after stirring for several minutes.
After 3 days, yellow needlelike crystals of [HgI2HgII2(L–)2(CH3COO)4(DMF)2]·(DMF) (1) were isolated in 70% yield. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction (SCXRD)
studies reveal the ring opening of the central tetrazine moiety of
the ligand, which under these conditions leads to the hydrolyzed anionic
ligand L–1 (see Figure 1 and Supporting Information Tables S1–S3).
It is noteworthy that any attempts to isolate any other complexes
using different metal salts to probe the anion effect on structure
formation was unsuccessful. Moreover, the use of various solvents
also did not afford any solid material, thus highlighting the importance
of the coordinated DMF molecule in structural formation.

Figure 1 Molecular structure

environment of Hg metal ions. Packing arrangement of 1 (bottom) showing close intermolecular metal–metal contact
(blue dashed lines) in the supramolecular Hg8 unit. Color
code: Hg (green), N (blue), O (red), and C (gray). Hydrogen and solvent
molecule were omitted for clarity.

The structure of 1, which crystallizes in the
triclinic
space group P1̅, consists of a distorted planar
molecule with two L–1 ligands
and four mercury metal ions. Here, Hg1 and Hg4 are situated at the
edge of the compound while Hg2 and Hg3 reside in the center (Figure 1). These ligands L–1 lie within the plane of
compound 1 and are inverted with respect to each other,
thereby framing Hg2 and Hg3. The coordination environment of Hg1 and
Hg4 are heptacoordinate with highly distorted geometries, where four
coordination sites are occupied by O-donors from two CH3COO– anions, with the remaining positions filled
by three donor atoms from the L–1 ligand, two N atoms, and one O atom. The five-coordinate Hg2
and Hg3 atoms adopt a highly distorted square-based pyramidal geometry
with two L–1 ligands coordinating
equatorially (N- and C-donor atom) and the axial portion occupied
by a DMF solvent molecule. A close look at the packing arrangements
reveals that each {Hg4} unit faces a neighboring molecule
leading to weak metal–metal interactions (4.08 Å, Figure 1 bottom), thereby
forming a supramolecular octanuclear complex. All four heptacoordinated
and pentacoordinated metal ions are symmetrically distinguishable,
and thus their geometries are distorted differently because of varying
bond lengths and angles (see Tables S2 and S3).

The BpymTz ligand transformation in
situ results in two new anionic L–1 ligands that act as a template
for four Hg ions and drives a direct metal–metal bond between
the central metal ions. As shown in Figure 1, the =N–N= (N2-N4 and
N9-N10) fragment connecting two bipyrimidine substituents is a result
of the tetrazine ring cleavage. Furthermore, the presence of the C=O
group in one of the terminal positions of the fragment indicates metal-assisted
hydrolysis, thereby producing a ring opening. Observations such as
these have already been reported in tetrazine-based ligands,4a,4b however, instead of two C=O or C–OH groups in the
extremities of the fragment, only one carbonyl is formed along with
an unprecedented carbanion in the opposite side.

In 1, SCXRD analysis reveals a Hg–Hg bond distance
of 2.99 Å between Hg2 and Hg3. Although this distance exceeds
the typical Hg–Hg bond length of 2.50–2.52 Å, longer
metal–metal bond distances are common with organometallic compounds
where distances of 2.61, 2.66 Å, and even 2.71 Å have been
reported for Hg–Hg bonds.8 Furthermore,
literature pertaining to mercury triangles and rings clusters describe
Hg–Hg bond lengths from 2.77 to 3.16 Å.8

The elongation in the metal–metal bond in 1 is likely due to steric-related stress imposed by the coordinated
DMF solvent molecules. Because HgII ions forming metal
bonds are rare, Hg2 and Hg3 can be assigned, as HgI forms
the well-known dication {HgI2}2+.9 This is consistent with the charge-balance considerations
as well as the presence of a lower coordination geometry, which is
typically assigned to HgI oxidation states in HgII/HgI mixed-valence clusters.9 When considering the charge balance of Hg1 and Hg4, bond valence
sum (BVS) calculations indicate that the outermost metal ions of the
compound are HgII (Hg1 = 1.80 and Hg4 = 2.13). BVS calculations
could not be performed on Hg2 and Hg3 because no reference values
have been reported for an Hg–C bond.10 Moreover, each azo bis-pyridine ligand contributes a charge of −1
because of the presence of the carbanion, with the overall charge
of the complex being balanced by the four CH3COO– counterions.

To shed some light on the physical properties
of 1, spectroscopic analysis was performed. Ultraviolet–visible
(UV–vis) spectroscopy was carried out to elucidate the electronic
structure of the compound. Analysis of Figure S1 reveals two peaks around 200 and 250 nm, which are associated
with ligand−π-electron transitions. A broad absorption
peak can be observed around 350 nm, which is attributed to coordinated
Hg ions.8b X-ray photoelectronic spectroscopy
(XPS) was used to validate the oxidation state of the metal ions and
the structural composition. The results indicate a peak at binding
energies of 101.5 and 105.7 eV, which are associated with Hg 4f7/2 and 4f5/2 levels, respectively (Figure S2). Despite this close energy gap, the
results confirm the presence of HgI and HgII ions.11 Satellite peaks are also observed
at 108.8 and 112.6 eV and can be associated with the differential
charging effects, as previously reported in the literature.12199Hg solid-state nuclear magnetic
resonance (NMR) experiments were performed to support the single-crystal
X-ray data, which reveals broad peaks around 1519.6 ppm that indicate
the presence of Hg (Figure S3).13 Nevertheless, attempts to assign 199Hg–199Hg coupling were unsuccessful. Superconducting
quantum interference device magnetic measurements were also performed
to verify the magnetic nature of 1.14 No paramagnetic signal was observed at 300 K under an applied
field of 0.1 T. This is presumably because of the unpaired electron
in the outermost 6s orbital of the HgI atom pairing up
with that of the other HgI atom through the formation of
the covalent Hg–Hg bond.

To gain more insight into the
thermodynamics of the reaction and
on the electronic structure of the final compound 1,
computations at the density functional theory (DFT) level, accounting
implicitly for solvation, were performed. According to our hypothesis
(Figure 2), the initial
tetrazine ligand (BPymTz) is first hydrolyzed and coordinated to HgII, as these ions may play an important role in the catalysis
of the hydrolysis reaction. The irreversible hydrolysis reaction is
highly exothermic (−56 kcal/mol) because of the formation of
N2, whereas coordination is only exothermic by −3
kcal/mol, suggesting an equilibrium process (Figure 2, 1a). The next step groups
together several elementary reactions, ranging from deprotonation
(by acetate) to dimerization, which results in 1b. Given
the complexity of the self-assembly reaction mechanism and to avoid extensive
reaction network analysis, the reaction mechanism was kept minimal.
Ultimately, deprotonation and dimerization are exothermic by −20
kcal/mol. The final complex 1c includes two coordinated
DMF molecules in the crystal structure. Computational results suggest
that they are rather weakly bound (−12 kcal/mol), given that
the loss of translational and rotational entropy was not accounted.
However, experimentally, the complex crystallizes spontaneously, which
on the one hand stabilizes it further and on the other hand explains
the inclusion of solvent molecules to fill the otherwise void space.

for solvation effects by a solvation model based on density (SMD).

The Hg–Hg bond is, with
the experimental length of 2.99 Å (2.88 Å
computed), rather long compared to 2.49 Å in Hg2Br2 and 3.0 Å in metallic Hg.8 Therefore, the nature of the Hg dimer is clarified by analyzing
the atomic charges of the N donor in trans position to the C donor:
if they are neutral, donating N atoms, the core is indeed a {HgI2}2+ Å entity. Because atomic charges
are noumenons, but still carry valuable information, the charges of
both the Hg and the N atoms are determined with two very distinct
but robust schemes: quantum theory of atoms in molecules (QTAIM),
which only depends on the electron density and CM5, which is fitted
to reproduce gas-phase dipole moments. With QTAIM, all eight nitrogen
atoms that are coordinated to an Hg atom have a negative charge of
about 0.8 e–, suggesting that they are all roughly
equivalent as ligands. For the Hg atoms, QTAIM identifies partial
charges of 0.8 and 1.2 e–, suggesting {HgI2}2+ and HgII, respectively. CM5
shows a similar trend: the central N atoms coordinating the Hg dimer
are charged-0.1 e–, whereas the N atoms of the pyrimidine
are charged by-0.2 e–. Furthermore, the charges
on Hg are 0 and 0.3 e–, with the difference between
them being in close agreement with the QTAIM results. Hence, the atomic
charges are in agreement with neutral nitrogen donors, a central {HgI2}2+ entity, and peripheral HgII. The electrons to reduce HgII are, formally, provided
by the transformation of deprotonated N-atoms to neutral N donors.

Conclusions
In summary, a combination of tetrazine-based ligand and mercury
acetate yielded an unprecedented mixed valence HgI/HgII tetranuclear complex with a central metal–metal bond
promoted by ligand transformation. Solution and solid-state analysis
confirm the molecular structure. DFT calculations support the applied
characterization methods, and the computational results suggest the
energetically favorable mechanism of the compound formation beginning
with the hydrolysis of BpymTz, which results in tetrazine ring opening
followed by {HgI2}2+ dimerization.
The results presented in this work represent a new perspective on
the coordination chemistry and self-assembly of late transition metals.
