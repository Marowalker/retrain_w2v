Traditional
antibacterial dressings continuously elute biocides,
even if there are no bacteria. This unneeded release can cause cytotoxicity,
increase costs, and delay healing. We designed a bacteria-responsive
nanofibrous wound dressing, which can be degraded in the presence
of bacteria to release antimicrobial agents. A model biocide, benzyl
dimethyl tetradecyl ammonium chloride (BTAC), was incorporated into
bacteria-degradable polymers [polycaprolactone and poly(ethylene succinate)]
in two ways: evenly distributed inside the polymers as single nanofibers
and encapsulated in a core surrounded by the same polymers as core–shell
nanofibers. Because of bacterial activity (both lipase secretion and
acidic pH), degradation of the fibers was facilitated and caused the
release of incorporated BTAC. BTAC-loaded single and core−shell
nanofibers presented >1 log reduction of both Staphylococcus
aureus and Escherichia coli within 2 h. Additionally, the core–shell structure provided
a more controlled release of BTAC with prolonged antibacterial properties
than single nanofibers. The core–shell nanofibers also exhibited
minimal cytotoxicity against human fibroblast cells (>80% viable
cells
after 24 h contact). These nanofibrous mats have the potential to
selectively release antibacterial agents to prevent wound infections
without delaying wound healing.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Chronic
wounds are a global healthcare issue, especially in the
context of increasing prevalence of chronic conditions such as high
blood pressure, diabetes, and obesity. Wound care dressings play an
important role in the healing process of chronic wounds. Antibacterial
agents have been incorporated into wound dressings to eliminate colonization
and treat bacterial infections in the wound.1 The traditional design of biocide release systems has been based
on the continuous release of antibacterial agents, even if there are
no bacteria present. This unneeded release of antibacterial agents
can cause undesirable cytotoxicity to skin cells, which can delay
wound healing. Additionally, the system could be depleted of its antibacterial
agent in its reservoir before real infections occur.

To reduce
the misuse and overuse of antibacterial agents, bacteria-responsive
delivery of biocides has been suggested. Bacteria secrete various
virulence factors, which can act as triggering factors for the system.2,3 As a result, the system will release the antimicrobial payload only
when and where there is an interaction with bacteria. Bacterial enzymes
are one of the most common virulence factors that researchers have
used as a triggering factor in bacteria-responsive systems.4−6 In the study by Bean et al.,6 hyaluronidase
secreted by Staphylococcus aureus was
utilized for the responsive release of bacteriophage K embedded in
a photocross-linkable hyaluronic acid-based hydrogel. In another bacteria-responsive
system designed by Craig et al.,4S. aureus protease stimulated the degradation of
polypeptide-based drug-loaded nanoparticles. There are limitations
in each of these studies: hyaluronidase is mostly secreted by Gram-positive
bacteria with little to no excretion in Gram-negative bacteria, and
protease is naturally present in the extracellular matrix and is also
secreted by host cells. In contrast, lipase is secreted by both Gram-positive
and Gram-negative bacteria and is mostly the product of bacteria.

Lipase-labile bonds, such as fatty acid esters or anhydrides, can
be degraded in response to lipase. Polycaprolactone (PCL) is a biodegradable
polyester with a relatively slow degradation rate.7 There are few studies about using PCL in bacteria-triggered
systems. Xiong et al.8 designed a lipase-sensitive
triple-layered nanogel (TLN) as a nanocarrier. In this approach, the
TLN contained a PCL interlayer between the cross-linked polyphosphoester
core and the shell of poly(ethylene glycol). The PCL fence of the
TLN was subjected to degradation by the activity of bacterial lipases.

One important factor that should be considered in the design of
a bacteria-responsive system is the rate of response. An ideal bacteria-responsive
system should quickly respond to triggering factors secreted by bacteria.
The rate of response is dependent on both the physical and chemical
structures of the system. Systems with high specific surface area
such as nanoparticles and nanofibers have a good chance to be triggered
and provide a fast response. Besides high specific surface area, electrospun
polymeric nanofibers are highly compliable and have high porosity
with excellent pore interconnectivity. These features allow them to
have intimate contact with the wound bed despite highly variable and
irregular wound shape and also transport extra body fluid from the
wound to decrease the chance of infection.9−12 Over the last two decades, PCL,
a biodegradable synthetic polymer, has emerged as a class of biomaterials
of growing interest. Although PCL has shown excellent biocompatibility
and efficacy both in vitro and in vivo, its highly hydrophobic nature
and slow degradation may hinder its use as bacteria-responsive wound
dressings.13 To overcome this limitation,
we proposed to blend PCL with another biodegradable polymer. Poly(ethylene
succinate) (PES) is an aliphatic biodegradable polyester, which has
a higher rate of degradation than PCL.14 In this study, we intended to prepare electrospun nanofibrous mats
based on PCL and PES, leading to an improved degradation in response
to bacteria. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report
of bacteria-responsive electrospun core–shell nanofibers based
on PCL/PES. It is worthwhile to mention that in the single electrospinning
process, the drug added in the polymer solution can quickly migrate
to the surface or near the surface of the nanofibers together with
the evaporating solvent, leading to a high percentage of initial burst
release of the loaded drugs and lack of control over the release.15 This significant drawback can be avoided through
the use of core–shell nanofibers fabricated through coaxial
electrospinning.15,16 In this method, two polymer solutions
are pushed through two concentrically arranged orifices of a spinneret.
As the solutions are pumped out of the spinneret, the outer polymer
covers the inner “core” material. As a result, the deposited
polymer nanofibers will have a core–shell structure.17 Drug encapsulation in the core could lead to
drug release in a well-controlled manner and prolonged antimicrobial
efficacy.18 On the basis of the above-mentioned
rationale, we intended to prepare core–shell nanofibers, which
consist of PCL/PES as the shell and a model biocide benzyl dimethyl
tetradecyl ammonium chloride (BTAC) blended in poly(vinylpyrrolidone)
(PVP) as the core. The morphology, diameter, and the core–shell
structure of nanofibers were studied using scanning electron microscopy
(SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). These nanofibrous
mats can be degraded when incubated in the suspension of Escherichia coli or S. aureus. Drug release and antibacterial efficacy of single and core–shell
nanofibers were compared, respectively. Finally, the cytotoxicity
of nanofibers was evaluated using the (3-[4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,
5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) (MTT) assay.

2 Results
and Discussion
PCL and PES polymers were used as the shell
polymers in the fabrication
of core–shell nanofibers because of their bacteria-responsive
properties. PVP is a biocompatible and water-soluble polymer, which
could be easily dissolved in contact with aqueous media. PVP was added
in antibacterial solution as one of the components in the core to
improve the electrospinability of the core solution (Figure 1).

and (b) pictorial representation of core–shell nanofiber degradation
and drug release.

2.1 Morphology
of Electrospun Nanofibers
A total of 8% PCL solution and
20% PES solution were mixed at various
ratios and used for electrospinning. After the fabrication of single
and core–shell electrospun mats, we studied their morphology
(Figure 2). Nanofibers
electrospun with various PCL/PES ratios all showed the merged morphology,
especially PCL/PES 1:1 (Figure 2c), with the highest ratio of PES among all samples. Because
of the relatively lower molecular weight of PES than that of PCL,
the polymer solution with a higher amount of PES resulted in lower
spinability and more beads.

Figure 2 Morphology of nanofibers: (a) PCL/PES 5:1, (b)
PCL/PES 2:1, (c)
PCL/PES 1:1, (d) core–shell 8% PCL/30% PES 1:1/15% PVP with
2.5% BTAC, and (e) single 8% PCL/30% PES 1:1 with 2.5% BTAC.

Increasing the concentration of
PES from 20 to 30% caused a significant
changed in the morphology of nanofibers. As could be seen in Figure 2d,e, the morphology
of core–shell and single nanofibers changed from bead-on-string
to a smooth complete fibrous structure. The 1:1 ratio for PCL/PES
is more preferable than other ratios because of higher degradability
of PES than PCL. Therefore, the concentration (30% PES) and ratio
(1:1 PCL/PES) were kept in all the following experiments. Both single
and core–shell drug-loaded nanofibers had nanosized averaged
diameters of 329 and 346 nm, respectively.

The coaxially electrospun
nanofibers were further characterized
by TEM. Because the core polymer PVP is more electron-dense than the
shell polymers PCL and PES, the core and shell components should present
a good contrast under TEM.19 TEM micrographs
of drug-loaded nanofibers (shell: PCL/PES and core: PVP/2.5% BTAC)
were taken and are presented in Figure 3. The micrographs clearly showed the core–shell
structure of the coaxially electrospun nanofiber. A sharp boundary
between the shell and core along the length of the fiber was present,
indicating successful formation of the desired core–shell structure.
It has been explained in the study by Sun et al.20 that during coaxial electrospinning, the time of the bending
instability is much shorter than that of diffusion spreading so that
the sharp boundary could survive.

nanofiber

2.2 Drug Release Profile
To check the
responsive nature of the fabricated nanofibrous membranes, they were
immersed in bacterial supernatant and tryptone soya broth (TSB). Released
BTAC was allowed to form a complex with orange II dye via electrostatic
interaction, extracted with chloroform, and then quantified using
spectrophotometry. As can be seen from Figure 4, the percent of BTAC release within 24 h
from the single electrospun nanofibrous membrane S 2.5% BTAC (the
sample code is defined in Table 1) in TSB (13.1%) is much lower than that in S. aureus culture supernatant (46.1%) (P-value: 0.0001). This demonstrated the bacteria-responsive release
of BTAC from the nanofibrous membrane. PCL 2.5% BTAC referred to the
BTAC-loaded PCL nanofiber, whereas S 2.5% BTAC was fabricated through
blending PCL and PES with a 1:1 blend ratio. Comparison of the cumulative
release between PCL 2.5% BTAC (15.9%) and S 2.5% BTAC (46.1%) in the
supernatant showed the role of PES in the bacterial-responsive degradation
of nanofibers. This confirms that PES is more sensitive to bacterial
degradation.

Figure 4 Cumulative release of BTAC from the single and core–shell
nanofibers (sup: bacterial supernatant and TSB ).

It is worth mentioning that all the
core–shell nanofibers
displayed lower percent of BTAC release in TSB than single equivalents
in the first 30 min (Figure S1). It showed
that the core–shell nanofibers present a better bacteria responsiveness
and lower burst release of the payload. In single nanofibers, BTAC
was directly dispersed into the polymer solution. During the electrospinning
process, BTAC migrated to the surface or near the surface of the fibers
together with the evaporating solvent and contributed to the relatively
high release of the payload in the absence of a bacterial supernatant.
BTAC was better encapsulated in the core–shell fibers, and
its release was dependent on both degradation of the shell in presence
of bacterial enzyme and dissolution of the core matrix polymer PVP.
The better responsiveness and more controllable payload release in
the case of core–shell nanofibers could minimize unnecessary
side effects of the encapsulated drug. Also, in a bacterial supernatant,
CS 2.5% BTAC displayed lower burst release in the first 2 h (18.3%, Figure 4) than S 2.5% BTAC
(37.8%, Figure 4) in
the bacterial supernatant. This slower depletion of BTAC may potentially
lead to an extended period of antibacterial efficacy from the BTAC-loaded
core–shell nanofiber.21

To
better understand the effect of PES on the degradation, we immersed
nanofibers in TSB and bacterial supernatant of S. aureus (ATCC 29213) for 72 h and studied those samples using SEM. As can
be seen from Figure 5, all tested samples including PCL single electrospun nanofibers,
PCL/PES single electrospun nanofibers, and PCL/PES core–shell
electrospun nanofibers appeared to be stable in TSB. Different degradabilities
of PCL single electrospun nanofibers and PCL/PES single electrospun
nanofibers could be observed in Figure 5a,b. Nanofibers containing PES showed higher disintegration
than PCL after immersion in the bacterial supernatant for 72 h. Bacterial
activity caused enzymatic degradation of ester linkage in PES nanofibers.
This observation is consistent with the study of Hoang et al.,14 which shows the comparison of the enzymatic biodegradation
of PES, PCL, and poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) (PHB) in the form of films.
The PES film showed a rough surface with small cracks after 2 days
of incubation in the culture of actinomycete strain HS 45-1. PHB and
PCL films were degraded within 6 days with a lower rate of degradation
than PES. These results also correlate with the release data in Figure 4. The higher degradation
rate of PES than PCL led to higher 24 h release of BTAC from S 2.5%
than PCL 2.5% in the bacterial supernatant.

Figure 5 Morphology of nanofibers
after being immersed in TSB (left) and
supernatant (right) for 72 h: (a) PCL, (b) S/PCL/PES, and (c) CS/PCL/PES.

The acidic pH of the bacterial
supernatant (pH = 5) could be another
factor that facilitates the degradation of the nanofibers. To test
this hypothesis, we also measured the percentage of cumulative release
of S 2.5% BTAC in the pH = 5 buffer within 1 h (12.1 ± 0.4%),
which was significantly higher than in TSB (10.1 ± 0.4%) but
lower than in the bacterial supernatant (more than two times lower).
Acute wounds have a neutral pH and, during acute wound healing, there
is a drop in pH caused by various factors, including hypoxia and increased
production of lactic acid.22 Therefore,
it can be concluded that both lipase enzyme and acidic pH play a role
in the degradation of nanofibers, although the effect of lipase enzyme
is more significant.

2.3 Antibacterial Activity
The aim of
the present study was to design an antimicrobial and biocompatible
wound dressing. Among different possibilities, BTAC, a quaternary
ammonium compound (QAC), was chosen in the present work. QACs are
well-known as effective biocides against various microorganisms including
bacteria.23,24 QACs show a detergent-like mechanism of
antimicrobial action, which is due to their amphiphilic nature. QACs’
long alkyl side chains could permeate into the intramembrane region
of the bacterial membrane and lead to the leakage of cytoplasmic materials
and cell lysis. This invasion is due to strong electrostatic interaction
between the positively charged QAC head and the negatively charged
bacterial membrane.23 As our system was
designed to tackle the infections caused by two common strains of
bacteria S. aureus and E. coli, we conducted antibacterial test against
these two bacteria. Similar to S. aureus, E. coli also possesses lipase activity.25

Tables 2 and 3 show the antibacterial
efficacy of the BTAC-loaded nanofibers against S. aureus and E. coli at around 8 log cfu/mL
concentration. Bacterial reduction caused by the nanofibers progressively
increased as the contact time increased and the nanofibers loaded
with higher percentages of BTAC presented faster inactivation of bacteria.
As expected, all the core–shell nanofibers showed slower bacteria
inhibition than single nanofibers, which is consistent with the release
data. The hydrophobic nature of the shell (PCL and PES) could effectively
retard the penetration of water into the fibers and release of BTAC
was dependent on the degradation of the shell polymers in the bacterial
supernatant.15 The BTAC-loaded nanofibers
appeared to be more effective against S. aureus as a Gram-positive bacterium than the Gram-negative bacterium E. coli. This is likely related to the outer membrane
in Gram-negative bacteria. QACs target bacterial cell membranes. Gram-negative
bacteria are encapsulated by two cellular membranes and a thin layer
of peptidoglycan. Because of the presence of this second membrane
(outer membrane), they are better protected against QACs.23 Our result was consistent with the study of
Liu et al.,24 which also showed the lower
sensitivity of Gram-negative bacteria than to QACs’ Gram-positive
ones.

concentration of E. coli was 7.9 ×

We also tested the antibacterial property of free
BTAC and compared
it with the results of BTAC-loaded nanofibers. The concentration of
free BTAC was set to be equivalent to the cumulative release of S
3.5% BTAC within 2 h. S 3.5% BTAC obtained 100% reduction of S. aureus and E. coli within 60 and 120 min, respectively. However, faster bacteria killing
activity was observed for free BTAC against both bacteria. Free BTAC
obtained 100% reduction of both tested bacteria before 60 min. Although
free biocide was fast in inactivating bacteria, we cannot expect prolonged
and efficient antibacterial properties in the wound because free biocide
can be easily washed out by wound exudate. In addition, the sample
PCL 2.5% BTAC showed significantly lower percent reduction of bacteria
than S 2.5% BTAC (P-value: 0.01). This was due to
the absence of PES in the shell and therefore slow biodegradation
of the shell polymer as discussed in the drug release section.

The release study clearly showed the slower release of BTAC from
core–shell nanofibers than single ones. To better perceive
its effect on prolonged antibacterial properties, we conducted the
repeated antibacterial experiment. It can be seen in Figure 6 that in the second trial,
the antibacterial efficacy of S 3.5% BTAC is still higher than that
of CS 3.5% BTAC. However, in the third and fourth antibacterial tests,
CS 3.5% BTAC showed higher bacterial reduction. In this experiment,
we discarded the BTAC released in the previous challenge and moved
the mats to a fresh bacterial suspension. If we consider the effect
of drug cumulatively released in each challenge, a higher percentage
of bacterial reduction would be observed (higher than 50% in the 4th
challenge in the case of CS 3.5% BTAC).

Figure 6 Repeated antibacterial
test against S. aureus.

2.4 Cytotoxicity Test
An ideal wound
dressing should not exert severe cytotoxicity to skin cells, which
could be evaluated through in vitro cytotoxicity tests.26−28 One of the most important advantages of bacteria-triggered systems
is to reduce any unnecessary cytotoxicity toward skin cells through
on-demand release of antibacterial drugs. In the previous section,
we analyzed the antibacterial efficacy of the BTAC-loaded nanofibers.
To have an insight about cell viability of the nanofibers, human dermal
fibroblast cells were exposed to the nanofibrous membranes. MTT results
for all the mats after 24 h contact with fibroblast cells are presented
in Figure 7.

Figure 7 Cell viability
of nanofibers within 24 h contact. Note: Untreated
refers to the core–shell nanofiber with no drug in the core;
% BTAC is omitted in all the sample codes to save space in the bar
graph.

Untreated nanofibers (CS nanofibers
with no drug in the core) showed
the highest cell viability. There is no significant difference between
cell viability of untreated and PCL single nanofibers (P = 0.471), which indicated low release of BTAC from PCL single nanofibers
in the fibroblast culture. CS 2.5% BTAC and S 2.5% BTAC presented
>96% reduction of both S. aureus and E. coli within 2 h of contact.
However, >82% fibroblast
cells were still viable after 24 h incubation with both samples and
not significantly different from the nanofiber without BTAC, confirming
the bacteria-responsive nature of these samples. There were no significant
differences between cell viability of single and core–shell
nanofibers loaded with 2.5 or 3.5% BTAC. However, at higher concentration
of BTAC (4.5%), we observed a significant difference in cell viability
between single (S 4.5% BTAC) and core–shell nanofibers (CS
4.5% BTAC) (P = 0.008).

To compare the cell
viability of BTAC-loaded nanofibers and free
BTAC, we also included unencapsulated BTAC in the MTT assay. As nanofibers
were in contact with fibroblast cells for 24 h, the concentration
of BTAC for the MTT assay was chosen to be equivalent to the cumulative
release of BTAC from S 3.5% BTAC within 24 h (34 mg/L). According
to Figure 7, BTAC damaged
almost half of fibroblast cells (55.2 ± 4.0% viable cells). The
low cell viability caused by free BTAC indicates the nonselective
nature of BTAC. The cell viability of free BTAC was significantly
lower than that of S 3.5% BTAC and even CS 4.5% BTAC. Both S 3.5%
BTAC and CS 4.5% BTAC could achieve total reduction of the two tested
bacteria within 2 h of contact (Tables 2 and 3). These results highlight
the benefit of the responsive release of biocides: avoiding unnecessary
cytotoxicity toward mammalian cells. CS 3.5% BTAC could be considered
as a potential candidate in clinical application as an antibacterial
wound dressing for chronic wounds in view of its low cytotoxicity
toward fibroblasts and highly effective antibacterial activity toward S. aureus and E. coli.

According to the cell vitality results, it can be concluded
that
BTAC released in the cell media (even in the 24 h) is not at the cytotoxic
level. We also measured the release of BTAC from S 2.5% BTAC in the
fibroblast supernatant within 1 h. As expected, the percentage of
release of BTAC in the fibroblast supernatant (11.3 ± 0.5%) was
significantly lower than that in the bacterial supernatant (32.2 ±
0.8%) (P = 0.0001). Clearly, the drug-loaded nanofibrous
mats demonstrated selective responsiveness to bacteria.

3 Conclusions
Because of exceptional properties of bacteria-responsive
systems,
we fabricated core–shell nanofibers whose shell polymers could
be degraded in response to bacteria and therefore present on-demand
release of the model biocide (BTAC) encapsulated in the core. This
smart system showed significantly higher biocide release when it was
in contact with the bacterial supernatant than in TSB. More controllable
release of BTAC from core–shell nanofibers than single ones
could provide a prolonged efficient antibacterial activity. Besides,
because of on-demand release of the biocidal payload from the nanofibers,
they showed much lower cytotoxicity against human fibroblast cells
than the free biocide. The efficient antibacterial activity of these
core–shell nanofibers with no severe cytotoxicity makes them
potential candidates for tackling wound infections.

4 Materials and Methods
4.1 Materials
PCL
(MW = 80 000 g mol–1), PES (MW = 10 000 g mol–1), PVP
40 000 MW, dimethylformamide (DMF), dichloromethane (DCM), BTAC, MTT,
dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), and orange II sodium salt were purchased
from Sigma. Inovenso electrospinning apparatus (model Ne300, Turkey)
was used to fabricate single and core–shell nanofibers. American
Type Culture Collection (ATCC) strains were used in the antibacterial
test, including S. aureus ATCC 29213
and E. coli ATCC 25922. ATCC-PCS-201
neonatal human dermal fibroblast was purchased from Cedarlane Corporation,
Canada.

4.2 Fabrication of Nanofibers
PCL and
PES were dissolved in DCM/DMF (4:1) at a concentration of 8 and 20
wt %, respectively. PCL solution (8 wt %) was mixed with PES solution
(20 wt %) in volume ratios of (PCL/PES) 5:1, 2:1, and 1:1. Then, the
mixed solutions were used in single electrospinning experiments. Voltage
(20 kV), flow rate of solution (1 mL/h), and distance between syringe
and collector (18 cm) were set for each sample.

For core–shell
electrospinning, PVP was adopted as the core component and DCM/DMF
(4:1) solution of PCL/PES was used as the shell component. PVP was
dissolved in DCM/DMF (4:1) at the concentration of 15 wt %. Flow rates
of core and shell solution were 0.3 and 1 mL/h, respectively.

To prepare drug-loaded nanofibers, BTAC was dissolved in DCM and
added to PCL/PES blend for single nanofibers or to PVP for core–shell
nanofibers. BTAC (2.5, 3.5, or 4.5%) with respect to the weight of
the whole polymer was used in the fabrication of antibacterial nanofibers.
The sample codes are listed in Table 1.

and diameter of nanofibers were thoroughly studied using SEM (FEI
Nova NanoSEM 450). To visualize the effect of bacterial activity on
degradation of nanofibers, we immersed them in a bacterial supernatant
solution or TSB for 72 h and observed them under a scanning electron
microscope. An 18 h bacterial culture (108 colony-forming
units (cfu) mL–1S. aureus) was used to prepare the supernatant. To prepare the supernatant,
we first centrifuged the 18 h culture (5000 rpm for 15 min) and then
filter-sterilized (0.22 μm filters) it before storage at 4 °C.

The core–shell structure of the prepared nanofibers was
characterized by TEM (JEOL JEM-2100F) at an accelerating voltage of
200 kV, for which carbon-coated copper grids were used to collect
the nanofibers.

4.4 Drug Release Measurement
To study
the drug release, nanofibers were immersed in either the supernatant
of S. aureus culture or TSB (4 mg in
2 mL media) and incubated at 37 °C. To obtain the cumulative
release of BTAC, 600 μL of eluted drug medium was removed for
quantification and replenished with 600 μL fresh release medium
to maintain a sink condition. Removed medium was mixed with a 0.25
mL orange II dye solution (Figure 8). After 5 min, 600 μL of chloroform was added
to the dye–BTAC complex, and the mixture was vortexed for 45
s to ensure that chloroform and the dye solution were mixed thoroughly.
A 600 μL of the chloroform phase (the bottom layer) was removed
into a cuvette, and the absorbance was measured at 485 nm to allow
quantification of the dye–BTAC complex and hence BTAC.

4.5 Antibacterial Test
The antibacterial
activity of the nanofiber mats was tested by a colony-counting method24 against S. aureus ATCC 29213 and E. coli ATCC 25922,
which are commonly found in burn wounds, and representatives of Gram-positive
and Gram-negative bacteria, respectively. For the antibacterial studies,
logarithmic-phase cultures were prepared by initially suspending several
colonies in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, 0.1 M, pH 7.4) at a density
equivalent to a 0.5 McFarland standard of 1 × 108 cfu
mL–1 and then diluted 100 times to 1 × 106 cfu mL–1. A 15 μL of the diluted E. coli or S. aureus suspension was further diluted into 45 mL cation-supplemented Mueller–Hinton
broth or TSB. After overnight incubation at 37 °C, the concentration
of bacteria went up to 108 cfu mL–1.

A 2 mL of such bacteria suspension was added to a 4 mg nanofibrous
membrane and incubated. At the predetermined contact times, 150 μL
of the bacteria culture was taken from the flask, neutralized, and
serially diluted with PBS. A 30 μL of the diluted sample was
then spread onto a tryptone soya agar plate (CM 0131, OXOID). After
incubation of the plates at 37 °C for 18 h, the number of viable
bacteria (colonies) was counted manually for control (A, bacteria suspension without sample) and BTAC-loaded nanofibrous
membranes (B). Bacteria reduction was reported as
percentage and log10. The percentage reduction of bacteria
(%) = (A – B)/A × 100, and logarithm reduction = log(A/B).

To better understand the concept of prolonged
release of drug in
the core–shell nanofibers, we designed a separate antibacterial
experiment against S. aureus. In this
experiment, nanofibrous membranes CS 3.5 and S 3.5 were immersed in
an 8 log bacterial suspension for 2 h. After 2 h, they were taken
out, washed gently with PBS, and immersed in another fresh bacterial
suspension at the same concentration (cfu/mL). We repeated this test
for two more times and compared the antibacterial efficacy of core–shell
and single nanofibrous membranes.

4.6 Cytotoxicity
Tests
We applied an
in vitro cytotoxicity assay of drug-loaded nanofibrous membranes against
fibroblast cells (ATCC-PCS-201 neonatal human dermal fibroblast).29 Nanofibrous membranes were cut into the same
shape and weighed to 4 mg (triplicate). They were presoaked in 1 mL
of ethanol for 10 min. Samples were then exposed to UV light for 45
min (each side). Fibroblast cells were cultured in 24 well plates
at the density of 1 × 105 (cell/mL). After 90% confluence
was reached, 2 mL of fibroblast culture medium was added to each of
the wells, and the nanofibrous membranes were added. Then, the cells
were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. At the end of the incubation,
cell viability was determined using the MTT assay after removal of
membranes. Each well received 500 μL of 1:10 (v/v) MTT and fibroblast
medium solution. Subsequently, after 2 h incubation at 37 °C,
the media were aspirated and replaced by 500 μL DMSO. Last,
100 μL aliquots from each well (in triplicate) were transferred
to a 96-well plate, and viability of cells was evaluated by recording
the absorbance at 570 nm using a spectrophotometer (PowerWave XS2
Microplate Spectrophotometer, BioTek Instruments Inc., Canada).

4.7 Statistical Analysis
Statistical
analyses were performed via PASW Statistics program package, version
18 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Comparison of obtained data for
different samples was performed using a one-way analysis of variance
with Tukey’s post-hoc test. The significance level was set
at p < 0.05.
