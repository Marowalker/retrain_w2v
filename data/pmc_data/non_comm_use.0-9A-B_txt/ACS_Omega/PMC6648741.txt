Herein, we demonstrate
a new class of core–shell magnetic
carbon hybrid materials (Fe3O4@C) for remarkable
adsorptive desulfurization of dibenzothiophene (DBT), which have been
successfully prepared through hydrocarbonization of glucose on the
surface of Fe3O4 and the subsequent pyrolyzation
process. The as-obtained Fe3O4@C retains amorphous
nature of carbon shells with a large surface area and displays an
increase of iron atoms as active sites under elevated pyrolyzation
temperature which is favorable in the adsorption of sulfur-containing
species through physical and chemical adsorption, respectively. We
investigate the adsorption capacity and efficiency of Fe3O4@C as a magnetically adsorbent for the removal of DBT
in model oils under various experimental conditions including the
adsorbent obtained at different temperatures, the amount of adsorbents,
the DBT initial concentration, the regeneration approach, as well
as the interference species. Our results demonstrated that the as-obtained
Fe3O4@C at 650 °C (Fe3O4@C-650) displays a remarkable estimated adsorption performance
(57.5 mg DBT/g for 200 ppmw), extraordinary high desulfurization efficiency
(99% for 200 ppmw), and a high selectivity for DBT compared with its
derivatives. Moreover, Fe3O4@C can be recovered
in a quite easy, economical, and eco-friendly manner by an external
magnet after five cycles without significant weight loss, which significantly
simplifies the operation procedure and favors the recycle of Fe3O4@C. Combined with the economic and eco-friendly
merits, Fe3O4@C offers a new avenue to employ
the magnetic carbon materials for industrial applications and provides
a promising substitute for adsorptive desulfurization in view of academic,
industrial, and environmental aspects.

1 Introduction
The
sulfur-containing compounds that are generally existed in liquid
fuels are released to air in the form of harmful sulfur oxides, leading
to serious environmental pollution and human health issues.1,2 To eliminate the sulfur-containing substance levels in fuels, various
desulfurization approaches have been developed. So far, the most widely
used industrial technology to lower the sulfur levels in fuels is
hydrodesulfurization in which the sulfur contaminant is converted
into hydrogen disulfide and corresponding hydrocarbon.3,4 Despite its good performance in the removal of thiol compounds,
the inefficient adsorption of thiophene sulfides, the high energy
and hydrogen consumption, and harsh experimental conditions accompanied
with the loss of octane number have hampered its large-scale applications
and limited its performances.5−8 Therefore, tremendous efforts have been made to search
for alternative technology toward desulfurization.9,10 Among
them, adsorptive desulfurization (ADS) approach, because of its prominent
adsorptive performance toward organosulfur compounds, is considered
as a prospective approach for desulfurization because of the ambient
experimental conditions, effective removal of thiophene derivatives,
excellent recycling efficiency, as well as environment friendliness.11,12

Until now, a large quantity of adsorbents has been chemically
synthesized
and/or explored in the ADS process including metal–organic
frameworks (MOFs),13,14 molecular imprinted polymers
(MIPs),15,16 carbon-based materials,17−21 mixed metal oxides,22 and
mesoporous materials.23−25 Among these adsorbents, carbon materials especially
graphene, MOF-based carbons, and mesoporous carbons have gained significant
attention because of their controllable structure and chemical modifications.17,26−28 In most cases, the porous carbon materials endow
themselves with a large surface area, appropriate pore size, and plenty
of active sites deposited on their surface and thus could realize
highly efficient desulfurization through chemical and/or physical
adsorption process.29−35 More interestingly, recent attempts demonstrated that tailoring
the surface of the carbon materials with oxygen-rich functionalities
and depositing metals such as iron and nickel onto activated carbon
have been proved to realize effective removal of sulfides in fuels.36,37 Unfortunately, most of these carbon-based materials usually suffer
from the complex separation procedure that possibly hinders the recovery
of the materials and causes pollution to the fuel which thereby perturbs
the regeneration. In this regard, the preparation of new ADS adsorbents
with effective separation unit could meet the requirements and greatly
simplify the separation procedure. Fe3O4, one
of the important magnetic materials, is used as an ideal material
in biological magnetic applications, water treatment, and biomedicines
because of its biocompatibility, superparamagnetic property, nontoxicity,
and high chemical stability.38−42 Moreover, Fe3O4 can be encapsulated by carbon
materials to give a core–shell structure that is beneficial
for protecting Fe3O4 from agglomeration and
avoiding instability as well as maintaining the magnetic fields with
biocompatibility in many organic and inorganic media.43 Recently, further advancement has been achieved to capture
aromatic sulfur and nitrogen compounds by controlling the thickness
of the carbon shell-wrapped magnetic Fe3O4.44 However, the introduction of metal atoms as
active sites combined with a porous carbon material-encapsulated Fe3O4 as a highly active desulfurization carbon hybrid
material has not been explored.

In this paper, core–shell
magnetic carbon hybrid materials
(Fe3O4@C) were synthesized by a facile approach
through hydrocarbonization of glucose and the subsequent pyrolysis
process, which were employed for the dibenzothiophene (DBT) adsorption
in model oils under mild conditions (Figure 1). The as-obtained Fe3O4@C features with a porous carbon surface as an adsorptive cavity
and provides a location for the deposition of metal active sites,
which is favorable for DBT adsorption, whereas magnetic Fe3O4 acts as a separation unit that could guarantee the
separation efficiency. Moreover, the adsorption desulfurization results
demonstrate that Fe3O4@C shows a remarkable
calculated adsorption capacity (57.5 mg DBT/g for 200 ppmw), an extraordinary
adsorption efficiency (99% for 200 ppmw), as well as a relatively
high selectivity for DBT compared with its derivatives. Experimental
results and theoretical simulation indicate that the adsorption process
are composed of physical adsorption and chemical adsorption. It should
be noted that Fe3O4@C displays a quite simple
separation procedure and high recovery efficiency via a magnet, which
greatly reduces its economic cost and simplifies the operation in
an eco-friendly manner. This study demonstrated here paves a new way
to apply the magnetically adhered carbon materials to industrial applications
and offers a promising substitute for adsorptive desulfurization from
the viewpoints of academic, industrial, and environmental aspects.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Structure
Characterization of Fe3O4@C
The highly
active ADS adsorbent was synthesized
through hydrothermal carbonation of glucose at 180 °C, followed
by pyrolysis at 650 °C in a tube furnace to form Fe3O4@C-650. The typical scanning electron microscopy (SEM)
image of Fe3O4@C-650 is shown in Figure 2A, showing a microsphere wrapped
with wrinkle carbon coating, which coincides with the morphology of
the carbohydrate-derived structure by a hydrothermal approach. In
the center of this image, some undesired fragments are formed, which
may be due to the incomplete hydrocarbonation process. We note that
Fe3O4@C-650 displays a rough surface that possibly
arises from the formation of carbon pores which is produced from the
gasification of carbon under high temperature.45−47 In addition,
the iron atoms intercalated into the carbon lattices leading to the
distortions of the carbon microstructure cannot be seen in the SEM
image,45 whereas the existence of iron
atoms can be detected in the following X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis.
From the typical transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image of Fe3O4@C-650, a core–shell structure constructed
by Fe3O4 nanoparticles and carbon shells can
be seen clearly, the Fe3O4 nanoparticles remain
intact with an average size of 150–200 nm (Figure 2B, red arrow), and the carbon
shells are composed of carbon layers (Figure 2B, yellow arrow) and graphite layers in the
space between carbon shells with a relatively low graphitization degree.
From the XRD patterns of Fe3O4@C-650 in Figure 2C, we find out several
kinds of characteristic peaks existed in the samples. The peak at
26.4° (Figure 2C, green star) is assigned to the (002) diffraction of graphite sheets
with a slight increase compared with that of graphite (26.1°),48 whereas the peaks at 44.6°, 65.0°,
and 82.3° are interpreted as the (110), (200), and (211) diffraction
peaks of iron atoms, respectively (Figure 2C, JCPDS no. 06-0696, red triangle). We found
out that the peaks appeared in the region of 30.1°, 35.4°,
56.9°, 62.5°, and 73.9° are indexed to (220), (311),
(511), (440), and (533) of Fe3O4 species (Figure 2C, JCPDS no. 85-1436,
blue dots). As for the formation of iron atoms, we deduce that under
the pyrolysis process, Fe3O4 could be reduced
to iron atoms by carbon oxide that are produced by the hydrothermal
method of glucose with a large amount of hydroxyl and carbonyl functional
groups under mild or high temperature.49,50 Whereas under
450 and 550 °C, as indicated in Figures S1 and S2, we note that a negligible signal of iron atoms in Fe3O4@C-450 and Fe3O4@C-550
can be detected in the XRD pattern, but the diffraction peaks of Fe3O4 can be clearly seen. This is possibly due to
the incomplete carbonization at low temperature. These characterizations
reveal that coating Fe3O4 with carbon shells
at elevated pyrolyzation temperature will not only increase the content
of iron atoms as active sites of Fe3O4@C but
also improve the graphitization degree to a certain extent, leading
to multiple functions in this hybrid material, thus the performance
of adsorption will be greatly enhanced. On the other hand, Fe3O4@C obtained at higher temperature with a high
graphitization degree could create much more pores on the surface
of Fe3O4@C and thereby contribute to the adsorption
capacity and favor the diffusion of adsorbents.52

Figure 2 (A) SEM images, (B) TEM images, (C) XRD, and (D) N2 sorption
isotherm of Fe3O4@C-650.

Furthermore, Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) analysis
of Fe3O4@C-650 in Figure 2D displays a specific surface area of 314
m2 g–1, comparable to some carbon-based
materials,30 which is higher than that
of Fe3O4@C-450 (245 m2 g–1) and Fe3O4@C-550 (250 m2 g–1) as shown in Figures S3 and S4, implying that the carbon hybrids of Fe3O4@C-650 possess a larger surface area. While the corresponding total
pore volume reaches 0.18 cm3 g–1, which
is slightly different from Fe3O4@C-450 (0.29
cm3 g–1) and Fe3O4@C-550 (0.21 cm3 g–1) (Table S1). Moreover, the N2 adsorption–desorption
isotherms of Fe3O4@C-650 follow a combination
of type I and IV isotherms, suggesting that the coexistence of micropores
and mesopores and this kind of pores would possibly be beneficial
for the adsorption of small molecules (i.e., DBT) in fuels.51,52 Taking into account all the above characterization, we expect that
a core–shell structure of Fe3O4@C-650
containing iron atoms as active sites, carbon hybrids with a high
surface area as the adsorbent, and magnetic Fe3O4 as the separation unit could exhibit high adsorption activity and
easy separation capability for DBT as will be demonstrated below.

2.2 Desulfurization Performance of Fe3O4@C
Initially, the adsorption capacity of the
Fe3O4@C-650 adsorbent toward DBT was evaluated
by the RPP-2000S instrument in model oils (200 ppmw DBT in dodecane)
and compared with that of Fe3O4@C-450 and Fe3O4@C-550 (Figure 3). The adsorption capacity (q) was
defined as mg DBT per gram adsorbents. Figure 3 shows that the adsorption capacities for
all the adsorbents increase rapidly in the initial 5 min and almost
reach equilibrium in the first 20 min, suggesting that the adsorption
process occurs quickly. Moreover, we found out that both the adsorbents
display a moderate to excellent adsorption capability toward DBT,
while the adsorption performance depends on the morphology and component
of adsorbents. Among the three adsorbents, Fe3O4@C-650 shows a higher equilibrium adsorption capacity for DBT, about
30.7 mg of DBT per gram adsorbent can be removed from the model oils,
exhibiting an increase of 4 times in comparison with that of Fe3O4@C-550 (black curve, 6.76 mg of DBT) and 5 times
(blue curve, 4.98 mg of DBT) higher than that of Fe3O4@C-450. The adsorption capacity over Fe3O4@C-650 in our study is comparable with MOFs,53 ion-exchange zeolite, graphene,54 and
various carbon-based materials.22,55 This result suggests
that Fe3O4@C-650 demonstrates excellent performance
with respect to Fe3O4@C-450 and Fe3O4@C-550 adsorbents obtained at lower pyrolysis temperature.

capacity of Fe3O4@C-650 (red line),
Fe3O4@C-550 (black line), and Fe3O4@C-450 (blue line) toward DBT vs time.

In another aspect, the desulfurization efficiency
which was defined
as E = 1 – C/C0 was employed to assess the capability of the adsorbent
as shown in Figure 4. C0 and C are the sulfur
content in the absence and presence of adsorbents, respectively. For
all of the adsorbents, we found that the different desulfurization
efficiency was observed depending on the time, and the desulfurization
efficiency increases as the time increases in the whole time range
and almost reached equilibrium in the first 5 min (94% for Fe3O4@C-650, 14% for Fe3O4@C-550,
and 12% for Fe3O4@C-450), indicating a fast
adsorption rate. Because in the mass-producing system, a long contact
time to reach equilibrium is commonly avoided from a practical viewpoint,
the fast equilibrium in this system favors low operation cost. Moreover,
Fe3O4@C-650 exhibits the most effective desulfurization
efficiency at equilibrium toward DBT (red curve, 100%), which is much
higher than that of Fe3O4@C-550 (black curve,
20%) and Fe3O4@C-450 (blue curve, 17%). Similar
to the variation trend of adsorption capacity, the order of the desulfurization
efficiency (E) follows the same trend as observed
for the sulfur capacity. In combination with the excellent sulfur
adsorption capacity and high adsorption efficiency of the absorbent
as demonstrated above, all these results suggest that Fe3O4@C-650 demonstrates excellent performance with respect
to the other adsorbents. Therefore, Fe3O4@C-650
was employed as the optimal adsorbents in the following experiments.

Figure 4 Adsorption
efficiency of Fe3O4@C-650 (red
line), Fe3O4@C-550 (black line), and Fe3O4@C-450 (blue line) toward DBT.

Since enough amount of the adsorbent could ensure
sufficient adsorption
of sulfur-containing compounds. Then, different amounts of the adsorbents
were employed to investigate the ADS efficiency of Fe3O4@C-650 toward DBT versus time in model oils (200 ppmw DBT
in dodecane), as plotted in Figure 5. The desulfurization efficiency which was defined
as E = 1 – C/C0 was employed to evaluate the capability of the adsorbent.
Under the constant DBT concentration, with a further increase in the
amount of the absorbent, the desulfurization efficiency increases
and reaches an equilibrium value after the amount of the adsorbent
is raised up to 30 mg, indicating that the sufficient adsorption of
DBT occurs. This phenomenon could be easily understood that the enhancement
of the adsorbent surface area brings about the increase of available
adsorption sites. In addition, a fast equilibrium time can be observed
for 30 mg of the absorbent compared to the other two lower amounts
of the absorbent, which implies a higher amount of the absorbent,
enabling a sufficient and fast adsorption. We note that even when
the contact time increases, negligible further adsorption efficiency
enhancement can be observed for 30 mg of the adsorbent. This is because
the adsorption sites overlapped with each other, which decreases the
access of DBT to the adsorption sites of the adsorbent and causes
difficulty in the diffusion process. These observations are consistent
with those reported previously for the absorption of aromatic compounds
by different materials.54,56,57 In the following experiment, 30 mg will be selected as the optimal
conditions for the ADS. Moreover, as shown in in the inset of Figure 5, after the adsorption
reaction, the highly dispersed mixture of absorbents and model oils
can be separated and easily recovered by a magnet, which makes the
separation process an easy and economic. All the above strongly demonstrates
that Fe3O4@C-650 can be potentially used as
a magnetically separable adsorbent.

of Fe3O4@C-650 [10 mg (red line), 20 mg (black
line), and 30 mg (blue
line)] toward DBT. Inset: the separation process with a foreign magnet.

2.3 Investigation
of Adsorption Mechanism
Moreover, further discussions were
performed to acquire a deep understanding
of the ADS mechanism because various factors influence the adsorption
process. The most important factors that possibly influence the adsorption
capacity are the above-mentioned high surface area and pore volume
of the adsorbent. Considering all of the adsorbents, the presence
of high surface area in the adsorbents contributes to the adsorption
of DBT, leading to a larger sulfur capacity (Table S1). In addition, as demonstrated in Figure S5, micropores of around 4 nm and mesopores ranging from 10
to 40 nm were observed in all of the adsorbents, constructing a micro-
and mesoporous structure, favoring the adsorption and diffusion of
DBT, thereby giving rise to high desulfurization efficiency.

However, we found out that the adsorption capacity for DBT increased
sharply as the calcination temperature increases. First, the different
adsorption capacity between Fe3O4@C-650, Fe3O4@C-550 and Fe3O4@C-450
is partly ascribed to the different surface area-induced physical
absorption. Second, the chemical adsorption might contribute to the
adsorption performance because the aromatic ring tends to interact
with the benzene rings of DBT to form conjugated complexation.58 In addition, the highly active adsorption sites
of iron atoms that existed in the corresponding Fe3O4@C-650 also determine the different adsorption among the three
adsorbents. It is revealed that the Fe-containing adsorbent is liable
to interact with the sulfur atom (σ-atom) of DBT molecules accompanied
with the appearance of the stretching vibration band of Fe–S
(1065 cm–1) appearing after the adsorption.59,60 In this case, we speculate that the high adsorption capacity of
Fe3O4@C-650 may partly arise from the similar
reason. To clarify this hypothesis of adsorption mechanism, we investigated
the surface state of Fe3O4@C-650 before and
after the adsorption of DBT by Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR)
analysis. As shown in Figure 6, Fe3O4@C-650 shows the typical bands
at 3383, 2903, 1597, and 1377 cm–1 (Figure 6, black line), which are ascribed
to carbon shells produced from the carbon precursor under calcination.
Because of the coating of carbon shells, two peaks at 1597 and 1377
cm–1 are assigned to carboxylate groups, whereas
the band at around 580 cm–1 is associated with the
Fe–O vibration band.61 After the
adsorption of DBT, another two bands located at 1701 and 966 cm–1 emerge, which can be deemed to be the weak interaction
between DBT and Fe3O4@C-650 and the vibration
of Fe–S bonds,59 respectively. This
means that the adsorption process also arises from chemical adsorption.
However, we note that the band at 1701 cm–1 disappears,
whereas the peak located at 966 cm–1 still remains
after Fe3O4@C-650 and DBT were washed with methanol,
indicating that the physical adsorption indeed occurs.

Figure 6 FT-IR spectra of Fe3O4@C-650, Fe3O4@C-650 with
DBT, and Fe3O4@C-650
and DBT washed with methanol.

Moreover, the chemical component of Fe3O4@C-650 was also investigated by the thermogravimetric (TG) measurement
to certify the above results. As demonstrated in Figure S6, the TG analysis reveals that Fe3O4@C-650 shows a significant weight loss of 80 wt % when the
temperature rises from 300 to 600 °C and leaves 20 wt % of the
weight residue, which is assigned to the iron component, implying
that the chemical component of Fe3O4@C-650 was
composed of 80% carbon content, which endows Fe3O4@C-650 with abundant surface area and pore volume (Table S1), thereby enabling the sufficient physical adsorption.
On the basis of the above investigation, we propose that the adsorption
process is possibly mainly dominated by physical adsorption and partly
ascribed to chemical adsorption.

2.4 Effect
of DBT Concentration on Desulfurization
Performance
In view of the facts that high concentrations
provide more contact sites and generally result in high sulfur capacities,
therefore a high original concentration is used in order to obtain
a high adsorption capacity in experimental aspects. To address this
issue, we then investigated the ADS performance of Fe3O4@C-650 when the original concentration ranged from 200 to
1000 ppmw DBT (Figure 7) and found out that the maximum adsorption capacity of DBT on Fe3O4@C-650 increased from 32.6 to 56.0 mg with the
increasing DBT concentration from 200 to 1000 ppmw at the equilibrium
state; this is because the high concentration at the original stage
usually prompts the mass transfer between the oil and solid phases.62,63 However, it is found that the adsorption efficiency decreased with
the increasing original DBT concentration, as illustrated in Figure S7. This phenomenon can be easily understood
because of low initial concentration that enables effective availability
of adsorption sites and the DBT can be readily adsorbed, whereas at
higher original concentration, the overall adsorption sites are confined,
thereby leading to insufficient adsorption and the decrease of desulfurization
efficiency.

Figure 7 Adsorption capacity of Fe3O4@C-650 toward
DBT under different sulfur initial concentrations.

2.5 Regeneration Performance
Among various
methods employed in adsorptive desulfurization, solvent extraction
and thermal treatment have been thought to be the commonly utilized
regeneration method.36,64,65 In this work, solvent extraction and thermal treatment were both
employed to investigate the regeneration performance of Fe3O4@C-650. As for the solvent exaction method, after the
completion of the first adsorption cycle, Fe3O4@C-650 was collected by an external magnet and washed by adding methanol
as the extraction solvent. Afterward, Fe3O4@C-650
was dried for the next run. As illustrated in Figure 8, it is found that the Fe3O4@C-650 absorbent (light gray column) can be easily regenerated
with solvent washing for the first two runs. This is probably because
physical adsorption dominates the adsorption process and most of the
deactivated adsorbents caused by contamination could be regenerated
by the solvent extraction method for the initial cycles. However,
after five successive regeneration operations, the adsorbent keeps
67% of the initial desulfurization efficiency (corresponding to 20.22
mg DBT/g) with the fresh adsorbent. With an increase in the number
of cycles, the much more active sites interact with DBT and fewer
active sites were left for the latter run, thereby resulting in the
decreased desulfurization efficiency in the subsequent regeneration
runs.

Figure 8 Regeneration capability of Fe3O4@C-650 with
solvent extraction (light gray) and thermal treatment (dark gray).
(DBT: 200 ppmw, absorbent, 30 mg, solvent: methanol). Therefore, in
this work, the further thermal treatment of the regenerated adsorbent
is highly desirable for the sake of retaining the adsorption capacity
in an expected range.

To improve the regenerative effect of the Fe3O4@C-650 adsorbent, the thermal treatment approach was introduced.
After regenerated by solvent extraction, the obtained adsorbent was
activated at 350 °C for 1 h under nitrogen atmosphere. As illustrated
in Figure 8, Fe3O4@C-650 regenerated by thermal treatment (Figure 8, dark gray column)
afforded 98 and 96% of the primary adsorption efficiency for the second
and third runs, which are 29.53 and 28.96 mg DBT/g, respectively (Figure S8, dark gray column), while the corresponding
values are 92, 91, and 87% for the successive recycle. The regeneration
efficiencies herein are comparable to those of reported carbon adsorbents
in the previous literature,64−67 whereas the expected regeneration efficiency cannot
be realized by the solvent extraction approach only.

2.6 Interference Experiments
Generally,
aromatic molecules and sulfur-containing compounds in the fuel hinder
the selective adsorption of adsorbent toward the target molecule.
Therefore, the influence of these compounds should be investigated
in detail to attain deep desulfurization. Because aromatic molecules
are naturally existed in fuels, effective removal of DBT with the
coexistence of aromatic molecules is an urgent issue.68,69 In this work, the adsorptive removal of DBT in the presence of tetralin
was investigated by Fe3O4@C-650. Figure 9 demonstrates that the adsorption
capacity decreased by increasing the proportion of tetralin probably
because DBT and tetralin compete each other in the adsorption process.
When the percentage of tetralin reached up to 10%, a larger drop of
DBT adsorption capacity from 30.42 to 19.94 mg DBT/g was observed,
and when the fraction of tetralin increased from 10 to 20%, a relatively
slower drop of DBT adsorption amount from 19.94 to 13.25 mg DBT/g
was observed. This anti-interference phenomenon is superior to the
reported results that boron nitride was utilized as the adsorbent,
in which the DBT adsorption performance was reduced by 23% in the
presence of an interference substance.54 The decreased adsorption capacity in the presence of tetralin may
be attributed to tetralin is prone to form π–π
interaction with graphitic planes in the carbons.70 The adsorption difference between tetralin and DBT lies
in oxygen-containing functionalities acting as acid centers on the
carbon surface,68,71 favoring DBT adsorption, whereas
such interaction seems too weak to be observed or absent between tetralin
and carbon.

Figure 9 Adsorption capacity of Fe3O4@C-650 toward
DBT in the presence of tetralin with different mass fractions (0,
10, and 20 wt %).

In addition, further
experiments have been performed by using benzothiophene
(BT), 4-methylDBT (4-MDBT), and 4,6-dimethylDBT (4,6-DMDBT) as interferences
to investigate the selectivity of the adsorbent. The adsorption capacities
for BT, 4-MDBT, and 4,6-DMDBT are summarized in Figure 10. The adsorption capacity
of Fe3O4@C-650 toward BT is calculated to be
24.7 (mg/g) of BT, which is slightly lower than that of 27.3 (mg/g)
of 4,6-DMDBT. In the case of 4-MDBT, the adsorption capacity reaches
up to 30.4 (mg/g) of 4-MDBT. Nevertheless, the adsorption capacity
on DBT increases to 33.9 (mg/g) of DBT under the same conditions,
although DBT lacks a methyl group compared to 4-MDBT, indicating that
the molecular size of sulfur compounds did not play a leading role
in the adsorption performance. Compared to other thiophenic derivatives,
DBT and 4-MDBT display higher adsorption capacity, indicating that
this kind of adsorbent favors the DBT and 4-MDBT removal than the
other thiophenic compounds. This trend is consistent with many previous
reports in which the reason was attributed to the differences in adsorption
energy and interaction strength. In summary, the different adsorption
performance of Fe3O4@C-650 toward various sulfur
compounds, indicating that the adsorption of sulfur compounds on the
carbon surface, is possibly dominated by many aspects including π-
interactions, strength of interaction that depends on the number of
π electrons or the size of the aromatic ring systems, and the
number of electron-donating groups.72

2.7 Theoretical Simulation
Langmuir and
Freundlich isotherms are considered as the typical standard to describe
the adsorption behavior between the adsorbents and the target molecules.73 In the present study, both the models were used
to investigate the adsorption capacity toward DBT. The experimental
data of Fe3O4@C-650 toward DBT adsorption were
analyzed by using Langmuir (eq 1) and Freundlich (eq 2) isotherm models.56,74,75 1   2  where Ce and qe refer to
the concentration (mg·L–1) and the amount adsorbed
(mg S·g–1) at equilibrium, respectively. KL and qm are the
Langmuir-type constants and adsorption
capacity, respectively. Kf and n denote the Freundlich constants and adsorption intensity,
respectively.

As displayed in Figure 11 and Table 1, we can observe that the adsorption of Fe3O4@C-650 toward DBT can be described simultaneously by
the Langmuir and Freundlich models. Nevertheless, the value of correlation
coefficient R2 values indicates that the
Langmuir isotherm model fits well to the experimental data than that
of the Freundlich isotherm, suggesting that the Langmuir model was
favorable for describing the ADS of DBT. On the basis of the Langmuir
model, the maximum adsorption capacity of Fe3O4@C-650 toward DBT was calculated to be 57.5 mg DBT/g. As shown in Table 2, the above-mentioned
adsorption capacity of Fe3O4@C-650 was superior
or comparable than most of the reported MIPs and activated carbon
adsorbents.22,74,76,77 We note that the carbon aerogel demonstrates
a higher adsorption capacity than our synthesized adsorbents and those
kinds of adsorbents.29 However, in view
of the environment and economical aspects, high adsorption capacity
and magnetically separable adsorbents will be favorable for the desulfurization
process in practical industrial applications.

3 Conclusions
In summary, a novel class of core–shell magnetic carbon
hybrid materials (Fe3O4@C) derived from the
pyrolyzation of glucose and Fe3O4 have been
successfully prepared and utilized for the removal of DBT under mild
conditions. The adsorbents possess a magnetic core, a porous carbon
shell, and metal ions as active sites. The porous carbon shell makes
a great contribution to the adsorptive desorption of DBT through physical
adsorption, whereas the metal ions act as the active sites, which
are responsible for the chemical adsorption. By integrating the combination
of the two adsorption process, an enhanced adsorption performance
(57.5 mg DBT/g for 200 ppmw), a high desulfurization rate (99% for
200 ppmw), and a relatively high selectivity for DBT were obtained,
which is higher than most of the existed adsorbents. In addition,
the adsorbent can be recovered in a quite easy, economical, and eco-friendly
manner by a magnet for five successive runs without appreciable loss
in the adsorptive efficiency, which significantly simplifies the operation
procedure. By integrating the economic and environmental merits of
the prepared process, the advantages of easy preparation procedure
and environmental compatibility endow them as a promising candidate
for practical applications.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials and Chemicals
Fe3O4 used in this study (Figure 1) was prepared in accordance with the reported
iterature.80 All chemicals and reagents
were of analytical grade and used without further treatment. FeCl3·6H2O, urea, glucose, and ethylene glycol
were purchased from Fuchen Chemical Reagents Co. Ltd. BT, DBT, 4-MDBT,
and 4,6-DMDBT were obtained from Aladdin. Model oils were prepared
by mixing different concentrations of DBT into dodecane to give a
final sulfur concentration of 200, 400, 600, 800, and 1000 ppmw and
then were used for adsorptive desulfurization analysis.

4.2 Preparation of Fe3O4@C
Fe3O4 was prepared by the solvothermal
reaction according to the reported method with slight modification.80 Typically, FeCl3·6H2O (0.5 g) and urea (1.0 g) were dissolved in ethylene glycol (35
ml) with stirring for 30 min at room temperature and were then transferred
into a 50 mL stainless-steel autoclave, and the obtained mixture was
heated at 200 °C with 3 °C/min for 12 h. After the reaction,
the solid product was gathered by an external magnet, washed sequentially
with distilled water and ethanol, and then dried under vacuum to give
the final Fe3O4 product.

The synthesis
of Fe3O4@C comprised the following procedures:
(i) hydrothermal carbonation of glucose at 180 °C and (ii) activation
with pyrolysis at high temperature in a tube furnace. In a typical
synthesis, 30 mL of glucose (0.6 mol/L) and 120 mg of Fe3O4 were added into a 50 mL capacity stainless-steel autoclave
with the temperature held at 180 °C for 6 h. After the reaction,
the solid product was separated, washed with distilled water and ethanol,
and then dried in an oven at 120 °C overnight. Subsequently,
the obtained solid was heated at 650 °C for 6 h in a furnace
tube under nitrogen atmosphere to give Fe3O4@C-650. For comparison, Fe3O4@C-450 and Fe3O4@C-550 were obtained under the same procedure,
while the pyrolysis temperature was held at 450 and 550 °C, respectively.

4.3 Apparatus and Characterization
Desulfurization
measurements were conducted by a UV fluorescence sulfur analyzer (RPP-2000S)
(Taizhou Zhonghuan Analysis Instrument Co., Ltd., China). The FT-IR
spectra were recorded on a TENSOR-27 spectrophotometer (Bruker, USA).
The morphologies of the adsorbent were characterized by using SEM
(S-4800, Hitachi, Japan) and TEM (TEM-2100F, JEOL, Japan). XRD was
conducted on an X-ray diffractometer (Rigaku D/max 2500) with Cu Kα
radiation in the range from 5° to 90°. X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy was taken on an X-ray source (ESCALab220I-XL) with aluminum
Kα line at 1486.6 eV. The thermal decomposing curve of the adsorbent
was recorded by the TG analysis (TGA, Netzsch/STA449F3) system.

4.4 Adsorptive Desulfurization Measurements
Model oils were prepared by dissolving DBT in dodecane with sulfur
contents of 200, 400, 600, 800, and 1000 ppmw. Adsorptive desulfurization
experiments were conducted by adding 30 mg of adsorbents (i.e., Fe3O4@C-650) to 1 mL of the model oil in the microreactor
at room temperature and then monitored by the RPP-2000S instrument.
The adsorptive desulfurization capacity (eq 3) and desulfurization efficiency (eq 4) were determined by the
following equations. 3   4  where q represents the adsorption
capacity (mg/g) and m and M refer
to the mass of model oil (g) and adsorbent (g), respectively. MDBT and MS are the
molecular weight of DBT and S (g/mol), respectively. C0 and C denote the concentration of S
before and after the addition of adsorbent, respectively. E is the desulfurization efficiency.

Adsorption of
thiophenic compounds was studied by adding the same molar concentration
of BT, DBT, 4-MDBT, and 4,6-DMDBT separately into dodecane. The interference
experiment of aromatic compounds (i.e., tetralin) was conducted by
adding different amounts of tetralin into dodecane. The liquid layer
was analyzed to estimate the selectivity of thiophenic compounds and
interferences from arenes.

Regeneration experiments: the solvent
extract approach was conducted
by washing the adsorbent with methanol three times and then dried
in an oven for the next run. As for the thermal treatment method,
after being washed with methanol by solvent extraction, the resulting
adsorbent was heated to 350 °C for 1 h under nitrogen atmosphere
and then used directly for the next adsorption cycles.
