The main objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of the preparation
of the nanofluids based on the interactions between the surfactants,
nanoparticles, and brine for being applied in ultra-low interfacial
tension (IFT) for an enhanced oil recovery process. Three methodologies
for the addition of the salt–surfactant–nanoparticle
components for the formulation of an efficient injection fluid were
evaluated: order of addition (i) salts, nanoparticles, and surfactants,
(ii) salts, surfactants, and then nanoparticles, (iii) surfactants,
nanoparticles, and then salts. Also, the effects of the total dissolved
solids and the surfactant concentration were evaluated in the interfacial
tension for selecting the better formulation of the surfactant solution.
Three nanoparticles of different chemical natures were studied: silica
gel (SiO2), alumina (γ-Al2O3), and magnetic iron core–carbon shell nanoparticles. The
nanoparticles were characterized using dynamic light scattering, zeta-potential, N2 physisorption
at −196 °C, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy.
In addition, the interactions between the surfactant, different types
of nanoparticles, and brine were investigated through adsorption isotherms
for the three methodologies. The nanofluids based on the different
nanoparticles were evaluated through IFT measurements using the spinning
drop method. The adsorbed amount of surfactant mixture on nanoparticles
decreased in the order of alumina > silica gel > magnetic iron
core–carbon
shell nanoparticles. The minimum IFT achieved was 1 × 10–4 mN m–1 following the methodology
II at a core–shell nanoparticle dosage of 100 mg L–1.

1 Introduction
The current decline in
oil reserves and high energy demand worldwide
leads to the continuous improvement of conventional extraction methods.1,2 Depending on the fluids and petrophysical properties of the rock
and reservoir conditions, several enhanced oil recovery (EOR) methods
are used to recover as much oil as possible.3,4 The
chemical enhanced oil recovery (CEOR) methods have gained great importance
and attention as their field application has increased due to the
high impact on the recovery factor.4,5 The surfactant
flooding is one of the CEOR processes, which has been applied in reservoirs
after applying some oil recovery methods such as waterflooding and
polymer flooding.6 The surfactant contributes
to reducing the interfacial tension (IFT) between water and crude
oil up to ultra-low ranges (from 10–3 up to 10–6 mN m–1), alters the porous medium
wettability, and consequently releases the trapped oil by capillary
and interfacial forces in the porous medium.7 However, the adsorption of the surfactant solution,1 significantly decreases the efficiency of surfactant flooding
and increases the cost of the process. This situation implies to reduce
the cost/benefit ratio with the improvement of conventional EOR techniques.8,9 Sulfonates and sulfonate/alcohol mixtures are frequently used as
surfactant solutions with electrolytes to achieve interfacial tension
values in the ultra-low range to significantly decrease the saturation
of residual oil (<0.05).1,3,9 However, there are different critical factors that significantly
affect the process behavior such as chemical nature, surfactant concentration,
salinity, temperature, and adsorption onto the porous medium.7,10,11 Many studies have reported the
use of binary and ternary surfactant mixtures in optimal formulations
to promote synergistic effects for the reduction of the interfacial
tension to ultra-low ranges.7,12−15

Recently, several authors have reported the use of nanotechnology
in synergy with different conventional EOR techniques such as polymer
flooding,16−18 surfactant flooding,15,19−21 and alkali–surfactant–polymer flooding22,23 to increase its performance regarding areal sweep efficiency, wettability
alteration, and interfacial tension for improving oil recovery. In
this sense, Xu et al.24 focused their work
on the formulation of a nanofluid based on an anionic surfactant and
commercial silica gel nanoparticles for obtaining ultra-low interfacial
tension. All solutions were prepared with simulated formation water.
The interfacial tension was reduced to values of 1 × 10–3 mN m–1 with a concentration of the anionic surfactant
of 0.05 wt % and slightly decreased with a nanoparticle concentration
of 0.01 wt % at a temperature of 90 °C. Suleimanov et al.25 evaluated the synergistic effect of an anionic
surfactant and nonferrous metal nanoparticles on the IFT reduction
for enhanced oil recovery. The authors, however, did not report the
use of brine in their study. The nanofluid reduced the IFT up to 10.9
× 10–3 N m–1 at a nanoparticle
concentration of 0.001 wt % and at room temperature. Shahzad et al.26 performed a review that discussed the use of
nanoparticles in enhanced oil recovery methods. The nanofluids were
prepared with nanoparticles of silica, alumina, and zirconium oxide
and different types of surfactants. No ultra-low interfacial tension
values were reported among the systems. The lowest interfacial tension
obtained was 1.45 mN m–1 at a concentration of nanoparticles
of 0.01 wt %. Also, Betancur et al.27 evaluated
the interactions between silica gel nanoparticles and surfactants
of different chemical natures for the development of a nanofluid as
an alternative CEOR method, ignoring the interactions with the brine.
The nanofluid obtained based on the cationic surfactant achieved an
IFT up to 5 mN m–1, which is above the range of
ultra-low IFT. Subsequently, Betancur et al.28 formulated a nanofluid based on magnetic iron core–carbon
shell nanoparticles and a surfactant mixture for obtaining ultra-low
interfacial tension. The minimum IFT was 1 × 10–4 mN m–1 at a nanoparticle concentration of 100
mg L–1. This behavior was related to the synergy
between the free surfactant in the bulk phase and the nanoparticles
with the adsorbed surfactant. It is worth mentioning that these studies
did not present a defined methodology for the preparation of the nanofluid
and did not consider the importance of the interactions between surfactant,
nanoparticles, and brine for obtaining ultra-low interfacial tension.

There is not enough information about an efficient methodology
for the preparation of a nanofluid based on the interaction between
brine, surfactant, and nanoparticles for being applied in the CEOR
process under conditions of ultra-low IFT. Therefore, this study examined
three methodologies for the preparation of the nanofluids composed
of three components (brine, surfactant, and mixture-nanoparticles)
based on the order of addition to the deionized water: (I) salts,
nanoparticles, and then the surfactant mixture, (II) salts, the surfactant
mixture, and then nanoparticles, and (III) the surfactant mixture,
nanoparticles, and salts. Adsorption isotherms were constructed to
investigate the surfactant–nanoparticle interactions in the
presence of brine. The experimental data of adsorption isotherms were
fitted to the solid–liquid equilibrium (SLE) model. The effect
of the nanofluids prepared based on the methodologies described above
on the interfacial tension between crude oil and chemicals (i.e.,
the surfactant solution with and without nanoparticles) was investigated.

2 Experimental Section
2.1 Materials
Two
commercial surfactants
were employed for all experiments: an alkyl propoxy sulfate (surfactant
1 or S1) and an internal olefin sulfonate (surfactant 2 or S2) purchased
from Ecopetrol S.A. using a suggested ratio (S1:S2) of 80:20. Sodium
chloride (NaCl 99%, PubChem, United States), potassium chloride (KCl
≥ 99%, PubChem, United States), calcium chloride dihydrate
(CaCl2·2H2O ≥ 99%, Sigma-Aldrich,
United States), and magnesium chloride hexahydrate (MgCl2·6H2O ≥ 99%, Sigma-Aldrich, United States)
were used for the preparation of synthetic brine solution. This brine
was formulated according to the conditions of the injection water
of a Colombian field. Fumed silica gel and alumina nanoparticles were
purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (MO, United States) and Petroraza S.A.S
(Colombia), respectively. Magnetic iron core–carbon shell nanoparticles
were synthesized based on previous works.28,29 An intermediate Colombian crude oil of 33° API was employed
for the interfacial tension measurements. Crude oil had a dynamic
viscosity of 117.6 cP at 25 °C, a surface tension of 32.4 mN
m–1, and basic sediment and water content of 0.5
wt %. The total acid number of the crude oil was 0.2 mg of KOH per
gram of crude oil. The average content of saturated, aromatics, resins,
and asphaltenes (SARA) fraction was determined through an Iatroscan
MK-6 thin layer chromatograph following the IP 469 method.30 The average content of SARA fractions were 53.9,
26.2, 12.2, and 7.7% for saturated, aromatics, resins, and asphaltenes,
respectively.

2.2 Methods
2.2.1 Nanoparticle Characterization
The
nanoparticles were characterized using Fourier transform infrared
spectroscopy (FTIR) with an infrared spectrometer IRAffinity—1S
(Shimadzu Corporation, Japan) for chemical composition identification,
dynamic light scattering (DLS), and zeta-potential using a nanoplus-3
(Micromeritics, United States) for particle size and pH of the isoelectric
point determination, respectively. N2 adsorption isotherms
were obtained at −196 °C with a Gemini VII 2390 specific
surface analyzer (Micromeritics, United States) for surface area (SBET) determination. For FTIR tests, KBr solution
was used with a KBr/nanoparticle ratio of 30:1 % w/w. For measurements,
15 sweeps per minute were taken for each sample in the range of 600–4000
cm–1 at a resolution of 2 cm–1. For the DLS measurements, the nanoparticles were previously dispersed
in deionized water at a concentration below 50 mg L–1 and then were subjected to ultrasound at room temperature for 4
h. The mean particle size was estimated from the Stokes–Einstein
equation.31,32 For physisorption of N2, the
nanoparticles were degassed for 12 h under vacuum conditions (6–10 mbar). Surface area values (SBET) were calculated by the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) method.33 For determining the pH
of the isoelectric point, a specific dry mass of each nanoparticle
type was added to different samples of deionized water with varying
solution pH from 2 to 12. The solutions were stirred at 600 rpm for
24 h.34 Then, the zeta-potential of each
sample was measured using a nanoplus-3 (Micromeritics, United States).
The measured zeta potential was plotted against the pH. The intersection
point of the obtained curve with the abscissa axis is the pH of the
isoelectric point.

2.2.2 Preparation and Characterization
of the
Surfactant Mixture
Interfacial tension measurements were
performed to select the total dissolved solid (TDS %) percentage for
the preparation of the synthetic brine, which was used in all experiments.
The synthetic brine solutions were prepared at TDS percentages between
0.1 and 2.5%. The brine employed was selected based on a characteristic
injection brine of a Colombian field. S1 and S2 surfactants were used
for the preparation of the surfactant mixture. Similarly, the surfactant
concentration was selected based on the interfacial tension behavior
between the crude oil and the surfactant at different concentrations.
For the preparation of the surfactant mixture, S1 was first added
to the brine (previously prepared) followed by S2. The surfactant
formulation was characterized using FTIR, critical micelle concentration
(CMC), and hydrophilic–lipophilic balance (HLB) determination.
The CMC of the surfactant mixture was approximately 1800 mg L–1 according to a previous study.28 The analysis of FTIR for a liquid surfactant sample35 was performed using the 2-propanol standard
with an infrared spectrometer IRAffinity 1-S (Shimadzu Corporation,
Japan) at atmospheric conditions. Ten sweeps per minute were taken
for each sample in the range of 600–4000 cm–1 at a resolution of 1 cm–1. The measurement of
HLB of the surfactant mixture was performed following the method proposed
by Chun et al.36 based on interfacial tension
measurements. Interfacial tension experiments were performed between
the aqueous solution with the surfactant mixture and crude oil at
25 °C. Each measurement was made in triplicate to ensure the
reproducibility of the measurements. For the interfacial tension measurements,
a Du Noüy tensiometer (Krüss, Germany)37 provided with a platinum–iridium ring was used.
The HLB value was calculated based on eq 1(36) 1  where
γ is the interfacial tension measurement
between the aqueous solution with the surfactant mixture and toluene.

2.2.3 Interaction Methodologies: Order of Addition
For the preparation of nanofluids, it is very important to understand
the brine–surfactant–nanoparticle interactions. Thus,
three different methodologies were employed for the preparation of
nanofluids to determine an optimal procedure to prepare the nanofluid.
The following procedures were evaluated: (I) the addition of the salts
to the deionized water, followed by the addition of the dry powder
nanoparticles, and then the surfactant mixture (surfactant S1 was
first added to the water and then surfactant S2 was added), (II) the
salts are dissolved in the deionized water followed by the surfactant
mixture, and finally the dry powder nanoparticles are added, and (III)
first, the surfactant mixture (surfactant S1 was first added to the
water and then surfactant S2 was added) is added to the deionized
water followed by the dry powder nanoparticles, and then the salts
were added. Each prepared solution was magnetically stirred for 2
h and left to stand for 24 h before the tests to allow the interactions
between brine, nanoparticles, and the surfactant mixture. These procedures
will allow producing a nanofluid with better properties for being
used in the CEOR process.

2.2.4 Adsorption Isotherms
The adsorption
tests of surfactant formulation onto different nanoparticle types
were performed based on previous works.27 These materials have not been applied in CEOR processes at ultra-low
IFT. The experiments were conducted at atmospheric pressure by fixing
the concentration of the surfactant mixture and varying the dosage
of the nanoparticles between 100 and 1000 mg L–1. The surfactant concentration was selected with the lowest value
of IFT at the different concentrations evaluated. For the experiments,
nanoparticles of different chemical natures were used: silica gel,
alumina, and magnetic iron core–carbon shell nanoparticles.
The preparation of each solution was performed based on the three
preparation methodologies previously described. The adsorption experiments
were performed through thermogravimetric analyses with a TGA analyzer
(Q50, TA Instruments Inc., New Castle, DE). The nanoparticles with
the adsorbed surfactant onto their surface were heated in air from
30 to 800 °C at 20 °C min–1 and a constant
airflow rate of 100 mL min–1. Also, the experimental
data were fitted by the solid–liquid equilibrium (SLE) model,
which is based on the adsorption theory of self-associative molecules
over a solid surface. The SLE model is described as follows 2   3   4  where q (mg g–1) is the amount of the surfactant adsorbed
onto nanoparticles, qm (mg g–1) is the maximum
adsorption capacity, CE (mg g–1) is the equilibrium concentration of the surfactant in the solution, K (g g–1) is an indicator of the association
of surfactant molecules, and H is the measured Henry’s
law constant and is an indicator of affinity between the adsorbate
and the adsorbent. Additional details about the SLE model can be found
in previous works.27,38 All measurements were performed
in triplicate to ensure reproducibility. The uncertainties were shown
as error bars in adsorption isotherms. The errors were calculated
through the root-mean-square error (RMS %)27 as follows 5  

2.2.5 Interfacial Tension Measurements
The IFT measurements were performed for nanoparticles of different
chemical natures at 52 °C and atmospheric pressure. For the experiments,
a spinning drop tensiometer (Grace Instrument, United States) was
used by adding a drop of crude oil to the aqueous phase with the surfactant
mixture and the different types of nanoparticles at concentrations
between 10 and 1000 mg L–1.39,40 The interfacial tension value is determined when the system is in
equilibrium by the Vonnegut equation41 as
follows 6  where Δρ (g mL–1) is the density difference
of the fluids, θ (rpm) is the angular
velocity, D (mm) is the diameter of the oil phase
drop and γ (mN m–1) is the interfacial tension
between the fluid with nanoparticles and crude oil. All of the measurements
were performed by triplicate.

3 Results
and Discussion
3.1 Characterization of the
Nanoparticles and
Surfactant Mixture
Table 1 shows the mean particle size of nanoparticles, determined
through DLS measurements and estimated the BET surface area using
physisorption of N2 at −196 °C. As expected,
the smaller the mean particle size of nanoparticles, the larger the
surface area. This behavior occurs mainly for nonporous materials,
as the carbon shell of the nanoparticles.42 Indeed, silica gel nanoparticles present the smallest size (7 nm)
and the largest surface area among the nanoparticles (389 m2 g–1).

The functional groups present in silica gel,
alumina, and magnetic
iron core–carbon shell nanoparticles were verified using FTIR,
which is shown in Figure 1. The FTIR spectra of silica gel nanoparticles (Figure 1a) present characteristic bands
at the 3200–3700 cm–1 range corresponding
to Si–OH. Si–H vibration produces a band at the 2250
cm–1 region and strong vibrations of the Si–O–Si
siloxane structure show characteristic infrared bands at 1570 cm–1. Vibrations of Si(CH3) appear in the region
near 1250 cm–1 and Si–H produces a band in
the 800–985 cm–1 range.43 Similarly, the FTIR spectra of alumina nanoparticles were
obtained (Figure 1b).
The band near 3600 cm–1 is associated with the stretching
vibration of hydroxyl groups (O–H), which can be due to the
presence of water in the sample.34,44 Another characteristic
infrared band appears near 1600 cm–1, corresponding
to the vibration of CO2 (impurity).45,46 The octahedral structure Al-O6 produced a band near 1070
cm–1.47 All of the structures
showed in FTIR spectra of alumina are related to the characteristic
functional groups of this material. Finally, the FTIR spectra of magnetic
iron core–carbon shell nanoparticles are shown in Figure 1c. It is observed
that the characteristic infrared bands in the region 3000–3600
cm–1 are associated with O–H and N–H
vibrations.48 The secondary amide N–H
stretching could be related to the use of urea (carbamide) during
nanoparticle synthesis. C–H stretching appears at the 2800–3000
cm–1 region, which can be associated with aromatic
structures of pyrocatechol. C=O stretching produces bands at
the 1650–1770 cm–1 region. The presence of
the carbonyl group can be associated with the use of urea for synthesis
or resulted from the carbonization of the polymeric network during
the hydrothermal process.49 C=C
stretching appears in the 1500–1700 cm–1 region,
which is related to aromatic structures. C–O stretching is
observed in the 1200–1300 cm–1 and 1050–1060
cm–1 ranges. C–H stretching produces a band
near 830 cm–1, which is related to the presence
of aromatic structures.50 Additional details
regarding the synthesis and characterization of magnetic iron core–carbon
shell nanoparticles can be found in previous works.28

shell nanoparticles.

Figure 2 presents
the infrared spectra of two surfactants selected for all experiments:
an alcohol propoxy sulfate (S1) and an internal olefin sulfonate (S2).
The surfactants S1 and S2 have hydrophilic and hydrophobic character,
respectively. The continuous line corresponds to surfactant S1 and
the dashed line to surfactant S2. As observed, the infrared spectra
for S1 and S2 show similar characteristic bands. O–H stretching
appears at 3300 cm–1. Both surfactants show characteristic
infrared bands of aliphatic compounds corresponding to the hydrophobic
carbon chain of the surfactant molecule. C–H stretching vibrations
occur near 3000–3100 cm–1 and produces characteristic
bands at the 2200–2450 cm–1 region.43 Similarly, CH3 and CH2 vibrations could be related to the bands at the 1400–1470
cm–1 range. However, the infrared spectra for S1
and S2 present some differences. The infrared spectra of the S1 surfactant
present a band near 1105 cm–1, which is associated
with SO42– vibration.51 The SO42– structure corresponds
to the hydrophilic group of the S1 surfactant molecule. The infrared
spectra of the S2 surfactant show characteristic bands at 1620–1680
cm–1 corresponding to C=C vibration. C=C
vibration belongs to the frequency group of olefins (alkenes).52 At the same time, the olefin is associated with
the hydrophobic chain of the S2 molecule. SO32– vibration appears near 967 cm–1,51 which belongs to the hydrophilic group of the S2 surfactant
molecule.

3.2 Effect of the TDS and Surfactant Mixture Concentration
on IFT Data
Salinity is one of the most important parameters
associated with the occurrence of an ultra-low interfacial tension.11 Interfacial tension measurements were performed
between an intermediate crude oil and synthetic brine with total dissolved
solids53 (TDS %) at concentrations between
0.1 and 2.5% at 52 °C and atmospheric pressure. The temperature was selected based
on previous work28 and it is within the
range of temperatures used commonly in surfactant flooding performed
at the field scale.54 The synthetic brine
was prepared based on a specific Colombian formulation. These experiments
were performed to choose an optimum salinity for adsorption experiments
and IFT tests. As observed in Figure 3, the IFT between the crude oil and synthetic brine
with 0.785% of TDS was the lowest among the evaluated concentrations.
Therefore, a synthetic brine with 6.46 g L–1 of
NaCl, 0.136 g L–1 of KCl, 1.05 g L–1 of CaCl2·2H2O, and 0.20 g L–1 of MgCl2·6H2O, for a TDS of 0.785%, was
used for all experiments. On the other hand, IFT measurements were
performed to select the concentration of the surfactant mixture at
which the lowest interfacial tension is obtained. For IFT experiments,
the 80:20 ratio between the surfactant S1 and S2 remained constant.
The IFT results were 4.5 × 10–3, 1.4 ×
10–3, and 2.2 × 10–4 mN m–1 for mass fractions of the surfactant mixture of 0.15,
0.18, and 0.2%, respectively. In agreement with these results, the
mass fraction of 0.2% (2000 mg L–1) was selected
as a surfactant mixture concentration for all experiments. The interfacial
tension of a system that contains a surfactant does not change significantly
upon reaching its critical micelle concentration (CMC). The CMC of
the surfactant mixture was approximately 1800 mg L–1,28 i.e., above this concentration, an
excess of micelles does not change the interfacial activity of the
system. This situation corroborates the selection of 2000 mg L–1 as an adequate surfactant concentration.

Figure 3 Interfacial
tension between the crude oil and synthetic brine with
different TDS percentages at a fixed temperature of 52 °C.

3.3 Adsorption Isotherms
Figure 4 shows the
adsorption isotherms
for the surfactant mixture of S1 and S2 onto nanoparticles of different
chemical natures at 25 °C. For the adsorption experiments, different
masses of nanoparticles were added to the brine with a fixed concentration
of the surfactant mixture of 2000 mg L–1. This surfactant
concentration is above the critical micelle concentration (CMC), which
was approximately 1800 mg L–1.28 The adsorption isotherms were constructed based on the
preparation methods I, II, and III. As observed in Figure 4, the adsorbed amount of surfactant
decreased in the following order: method II > method I > method
III.
In method II, the surfactant mixture is added to the brine solution
before the nanoparticles. The presence of electrolytes generates a
higher concentration around the surfactant molecules, which promote
the reduction of electrostatic forces between the charged hydrophilic
components of surfactants, favoring the formation of micelles.55 Thus, the surfactant is probably adsorbed onto
nanoparticles as micelles.27 This situation
is evidenced in the adsorbed amount of the surfactant onto nanoparticles,
which is the highest among the evaluated methods. For method I, the
nanoparticles are added to the brine solution before the surfactant
mixture. This behavior suggests that electrolytes could be interacting
with the charged surface of the nanoparticles.56 Then, when the surfactant mixture is added to the aqueous
phase, there are less free electrolytes that favor the formation of
surfactant micelles. Therefore, the adsorbed amount of surfactant
onto nanoparticles is lower for method I than method II. For method
III, the salts were added after the addition of the surfactant mixture
and the nanoparticles. In this case, the salts did not have the same
effect on the formation of surfactant micelles as in the case of method
I or II. This behavior suggests that the surfactant can be adsorbed
on the surface of the nanoparticles as molecules. Therefore, method
III shows the lowest adsorbed amount of surfactant onto nanoparticles.

Figure 4 Adsorption
isotherms for the surfactant mixture of S1 and S2 at
a fixed concentration of 2000 mg L–1 onto (a) magnetic
iron core–carbon shell, (b) alumina, and (c) silica gel nanoparticles
at 25 °C using Methods I, II, and III. The symbols are from the
experimental data, and the continuous lines are from the SLE model.

On the other hand, as observed in Figure 4, the amount of adsorbed surfactant
decreased
in the following order: alumina > silica gel > magnetic iron
core–carbon
shell nanoparticles. All solutions for adsorption isotherm construction
presented a pH of approximately 7. For pure silica gel and alumina
nanoparticles, the pH of the isoelectric point was close to 2 and
9.9, respectively.34 For magnetic iron
core–carbon shell nanoparticles, the measured pH of the isoelectric
point was 2.4. This behavior suggests that silica
gel and magnetic iron core–carbon shell nanoparticles in a
solution with a pH of 7 present a negatively charged surface. In contrast,
alumina nanoparticles in a solution of a pH lower than the pH of the
isoelectric point are positively charged. In this way, the positive
charges of alumina nanoparticles and the sulfate and sulfonate anions
of surfactants S1 and S2, respectively, generate electrostatic attractive
interactions. These surfactant–nanoparticle interactions favor
the adsorption of surfactants onto surface nanoparticles. The negative
charges of silica gel and core–shell nanoparticles make it
difficult for the surfactant molecules to get adsorbed onto nanoparticles,
which is evidenced in the adsorbed amount obtained for each nanoparticle
type.

For all cases, alumina and silica gel nanoparticles showed
type
I (a) adsorption isotherm behavior according to the International
Union of Pure Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) scheme.57 However, magnetic iron core–carbon shell nanoparticles
showed type III isotherm behavior using Methods I and II but presented
a type I (a) isotherm behavior when the nanofluid was prepared through
method III. Type I (a) isotherm indicates that the adsorbate is adsorbing
onto the adsorbent surface in a monolayer. Type III isotherm behavior
is characterized by low adsorbate–adsorbent affinities.57 The hydrophilic–lipophilic balance (HLB)
of the surfactant mixture of S1 and S2 was 18. This value indicates
that the surfactant mixture presents high solubility in water;58 i.e., the surfactant mixture has a polar character.
Likewise, it is known that carbon also has a hydrophilic/hydrophobic
character.59 Therefore, type III adsorption
behavior for magnetic iron core–carbon shell nanoparticles
can be related to the interactions between the hydrophobic groups
of the nanoparticle surface and the polar character of the surfactant
mixture. This situation is in agreement with the low adsorbate–adsorbent
affinities that characterize the type III adsorption isotherm. For
Methods I and II, the salts favor the hydrophobic interactions among
the lipophilic groups of the surfactant molecules; i.e., the presence
of salts favors the surfactant–surfactant interactions. The
hydrophobic groups of the surface of nanoparticles and the polar surfactant
mixture disfavor the surfactant–nanoparticle surface interactions.
In this way, the surfactant–surfactant interactions could be
stronger than the surfactant–nanoparticle surface interactions.
Then, the surfactants could be adsorbed on the surface of the nanoparticles
as aggregates. Similarly, the presence of monovalent or divalent cations
of the synthetic brine could neutralize the negative charges on the
surface of the nanoparticles and then the mixture of surfactants is
adsorbed on the nanoparticles. Type III adsorption behavior could
also be related to the adsorption of surfactant molecules by the lipophilic
group. Magnetic iron core–carbon shell nanoparticles present
hydrophobic groups in the surface, which would favor the adsorption
of surfactant molecules by their lipophilic group in multilayers.

For method III, the salts are added to the deionized water after
the surfactant mixture and the nanoparticles. The salts do not favor
the hydrophobic interactions among the lipophilic groups of the surfactant
molecules. This situation could hinder the surfactant–surfactant
interactions and favor the surfactant–nanoparticle surface
interactions. If the surfactant–nanoparticle surface interactions
are stronger than the surfactant–surfactant interactions, the
surfactant mixture could be adsorbed as molecules. Then, type I (a)
adsorption behavior is obtained.

Type I (a) adsorption isotherms
of the surfactant mixture onto
alumina and silica gel nanoparticles following Methods I, II, and
III were obtained. Both types of nanoparticles are polar as the surfactant
mixture. In this case, the surfactant–surfactant interactions
could be weaker than the surfactant–nanoparticle surface interactions.
As surfactant–nanoparticle interactions could be stronger,
the surfactants are adsorbed on the nanoparticles as molecules. Therefore,
type I (a) isotherm behavior was obtained for alumina and silica gel
nanoparticles.

Table 2 summarizes
the estimated parameters of SLE model for the surfactant mixture of
S1 and S2 at a fixed concentration of 2000 mg L–1 onto the magnetic iron core–carbon shell, alumina, and silica
gel nanoparticles at 25 °C following Methods I, II, and III for
the preparation of the nanofluid. As observed, the H parameter, which is an indicator of adsorption affinity of the surfactant
onto nanoparticles60 increases (i.e., adsorption
affinity decreases) in the order: method II < method I < method
III. The nanofluids prepared through method II present the highest
adsorption affinity of adsorbate–adsorbent among the evaluated
methods. The maximum adsorption capacity parameter qmax decreased in the order: method II > method I >
method
III. These results are in agreement with the adsorbed amount of surfactant
onto the surface of nanoparticles observed in the adsorption isotherms
of Figure 4. Similarly,
the trend of the K parameter, related to the self-association
of the molecules of the surfactant, is in agreement with the adsorbed
amount of surfactant onto nanoparticles. The adsorption experiments
suggest that a formulation of nanofluid must be performed following
method II. These results are in agreement with the results reported
by Betancur et al.,27 who studied the adsorption
of different types of surfactants onto silica gel nanoparticles.

3.4 Interfacial Tension Experiments
Surfactant
flooding is a chemical enhanced oil recovery method to reduce the
interfacial tension (IFT) between the crude oil and water and/or alter
the wettability of porous medium and thereby increase the oil recovery.9 For this reason, the interfacial tension is one
of the most important parameters to evaluate the performance of a
new fluid used in the surfactant-based EOR process. For a successful
surfactant flooding, the oil and gas industry considers that the IFT
must be less than 1 × 10–2 mN m–1.7,61 The aqueous phase was prepared with the synthetic
brine used for all of the experiments (TDS % of 0.785) and the surfactant
mixture at a concentration of 2000 mg L–1. In addition,
each type of nanoparticle mentioned above was added to the solutions
at dosages between 100 and 1000 mg L–1. The IFT
measurements were performed at a reservoir temperature of 52 °C
and atmospheric pressure. The temperature is within the range of temperatures
used in the Colombian field of study.54 As observed in Figure 5, the IFT between the crude oil and the aqueous phase with a surfactant
mixture of S1 and S2 (dashed line) was 2.2 × 10–4 mN m–1. It is observed that the IFT values decreased
in the order: method III > method I > method II for all of the
nanoparticles
evaluated. For methods I and II with all nanoparticle types achieved
IFT values below 1 × 10–2 mN m–1 within the range of nanoparticle concentrations evaluated. When
the nanofluid was prepared based on method I, the nanoparticles were
added to the aqueous phase after the addition of the salts but before
the addition of the surfactant mixture. Then, the electrolytes interact
with the charges of the nanoparticle surface and there are less available
electrolytes that can favor the formation of micelles of the surfactant
and facilitate the displacement of the surfactant to the interface
crude oil/aqueous phase. Therefore, the IFT value is higher than that
obtained with the surfactant mixture (S1 and S2) only.

Figure 5 Interfacial tension between
crude oil/synthetic brine with the
surfactant mixture of S1 and S2 at 2000 mg L–1 (dashed
line) in the absence and presence of (a) the magnetic iron core–carbon
shell, (b) alumina, and (c) silica gel nanoparticles at dosages between
10 and 1000 mg L–1 and at a fixed temperature of
52 °C.

For method II, the salts are added
to the aqueous phase before
the addition in the order of the surfactant mixture and nanoparticles.
The salts favor the formation of surfactant micelles, which are adsorbed
onto the surface of the nanoparticles. In this case, IFT values below
the base system (surfactant mixture of S1 and S2) were obtained only
for the magnetic iron core–carbon shell nanoparticles at a
nanoparticle concentration ≤ 100 mg L–1 (Figure 5a). The reduction
of IFT can be due to the synergy between the free surfactant in the
bulk phase and the nanoparticles with the adsorbed surfactant onto
their surface.28 At this dosage of nanoparticles,
there is enough free surfactant to reduce the IFT crude oil/aqueous
phase. The IFT reduction is associated with the weakening of the interaction
forces of the interface molecules. These interactions can be Debye
forces or Keesom forces as was described in the previous work.28 Likewise, it is observed that at nanoparticle dosage of 10 mg L−1, the IFT value was similar to that obtained with
the surfactant mixture (dashed line) but did not achieve a lower value
than that obtained at 100 mg L−1. At a dosage of
10 mg L–1 of nanoparticles, most of the surfactants
are free in the continuous phase. Therefore, the nanoparticles with
the adsorbed surfactant do not achieve a significant effect on interfacial
phenomena of the aqueous phase/crude oil system. In contrast, at nanoparticle
dosages of 500 and 1000 mg L–1 ultra-low interfacial
tension values were not achieved. At these concentrations, the nanoparticles
can adsorb a higher amount of surfactant from the bulk phase and therefore
the IFT cannot be significantly reduced.62 This behavior is in agreement with the adsorbed amount of surfactant
onto nanoparticles observed in adsorption isotherms (Figure 4), where the highest adsorbed
amount was obtained with method II. Similarly, for the case of magnetic
iron core–carbon shell nanoparticles, Table 2 shows that the H parameter,
which is associated with the affinity between the adsorbate and the
adsorbent, was lower for method II than those for methods I and III.
This behavior indicates that the affinity between the surfactant and
the nanoparticles is higher when the nanofluid was prepared following
method II. Therefore, if the the surfactant–nanoparticle affinity
is strong, the surfactant keeps adsorbed onto the nanoparticle surface
when they come into contact with the crude oil. Then, the reduction
on IFT could be related to the order of free surfactants and nanoparticles
with the adsorbed surfactant at the interface, which in this case
remains adsorbed when in contact with the crude oil. Additionally,
for the mentioned nanoparticles, qmax for
method II is the highest among the evaluated methods, which is in
agreement with the observed behavior.

In contrast, method III
presented the highest values of IFT among
the evaluated systems. For method III, the salts were added to the
aqueous phase after the surfactant mixture and nanoparticle addition.
In this case, the absence of salts at the time of the addition of
the surfactant mixture could disfavor the formation of micelles. Then,
the surfactants are adsorbed onto the nanoparticle surface as monomers
resulting in fewer surfactant molecules for the micellization process.
This behavior is in agreement with the type I (a) isotherm obtained
through adsorption experiments. In this way, the surfactant did not
achieve optimal conditions for the reduction of IFT to ultra-low values.
For example, for magnetic iron core–carbon shell nanoparticles, Table 2 showed for method
III, the highest H parameter among the evaluated
methods. This could be attributed to the low affinity between the
surfactant and the surface of the nanoparticles when the nanofluid
was prepared through method III. In this case, the low affinity
between the surfactant and the surface of the nanoparticles would
favor the desorption of the surfactant when the treatment contacts
the crude oil. In this way, the structures located at the interface
could be free surfactant from the continuous phase and the surfactant
that could be desorbed from the surface of nanoparticles. Therefore,
there is no synergy between the free surfactant of the bulk phase
and the nanoparticles with the adsorbed surfactant, and the reduction
of IFT is not significant.

4 Conclusions
Three methodologies for the preparation of a nanofluid based on
brine–surfactant–nanoparticles were evaluated for the
reduction of IFT of a given crude oil/aqueous phase system. The adsorbed
amount of surfactant mixture onto the surface of nanoparticles decreased
in the following order: method II > method I > method III and
also
decreased in the order alumina > silica gel > magnetic iron
core–carbon
shell nanoparticles. Alumina and silica gel nanoparticles showed type
I (a) isotherms for the three preparation methodologies, while core–shell
nanoparticles presented type III adsorption behavior for methods I
and II but type I (a) adsorption isotherm for method III.

The
surfactant–nanoparticle–brine interactions were
in agreement with the interfacial crude oil/aqueous phase behavior.
When the nanofluid was prepared following method II, the lowest interfacial
tension values were obtained for all types of nanoparticles. Meanwhile,
method III showed the highest IFT values among the evaluated methodologies.
The nanofluid prepared through method II with a nanoparticle dosage
of 100 mg L–1 reduced the IFT to 1 × 10–4 mN m–1. This behavior is related
to the synergy between the free surfactant in the bulk phase and the
nanoparticles with the adsorbed surfactant. Through this work, it
was demonstrated that the methodology for the preparation of a nanofluid
is a key factor to maintain ultra-low interfacial tension in surfactant
formulation to enhance oil recovery processes. Likewise, the understanding
of the interactions of nanofluid components allows designing an injection
fluid with the desired properties for a specific target.
