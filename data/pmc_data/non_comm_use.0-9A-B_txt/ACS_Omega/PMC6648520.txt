Calixarene-functionalized water dispersible silver nanoparticles
have been synthesized and characterized on the basis of UV–vis,
IR, X-ray diffraction, and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy
analysis, and their sensing properties toward metal ions have been
investigated. They selectively detect Hg2+ and Hg0 in solution and vapor phases, respectively, with distinct color
change. Interference study with mixture of metal ions revealed no
interference from any other metal ions used in this study. Their mechanism
of detection involved Hg2+-aided displacement of calixarene
moiety from the surface of the functionalized nanoparticles, followed
by the formation of Ag–Hg amalgam due to interaction of Hg2+ with Ag0 and also the formation of assembly of
Ag0 nanoparticles by dipole–dipole interaction of
the bare-surfaced nanoparticles. Electrochemical study revealed that
with the aid of functionalized nanoparticles, Hg2+ can
be detected amperometrically with high sensitivity. The detection
limits obtained for Hg2+ by UV–vis study and amperometry
are 0.5 nM (0.1 ppb) and 10 nM (2 ppb), respectively. The new material
has been used to detect Hg2+ in aqueous real sample and
Hg0 in soil sample.

Introduction
Widespread water contamination triggered by heavy-metal ions is a
global environmental concern, and among these heavy-metal ions, mercury
is one of the most toxic, which adversely affects human health.1−4 The
sources of mercury include gold mining operation, coal mining power
plants, natural degassing of the earth surface, etc., and it affects
millions of people working in these industries.5,6 Mercury
in its all three oxidation states (0, +1, and +2) is highly toxic
to the living species, among which Hg2+ has high solubility
in water and hence found in surface water in maximum quantity.7−9 It can damage kidney, central
nervous system, and cardiovascular respiratory system.7,10,11 According to US-EPA guidelines,
maximum tolerance of mercury in drinking water and food is 10 nM (2
ppb) only.12 Therefore, detection of mercury
at low concentration in aqueous media is important. Several instrument-based
techniques are available for the detection/estimation of mercury,
but they require costly instrument, highly skilled operators, and
tedious sample preparation methods.13−15 Some of these methods lack accuracy at very low concentration,
viz., ppb level. Therefore, simple alternative method(s) for detection
of mercury with high selectivity and sensitivity is most desirable.

In the recent era, different kinds of nanomaterials are used for
sensing of metal ions and molecules using colorimetric and fluorimetric
techniques.16−18 Among
various alternative methods for detection of metal ions, colorimetric
technique of sensing is one of the most promising methods of detection
and it has gained considerable interest due to its simple operation.19,20 In the area of colorimetric sensing, the use of metal nanoparticles
as sensing material is growing rapidly for the detection of various
metal ions.21−26 This method has attracted attention because of their
extremely high visible-region extinction coefficients (∼109 M–1 cm–1), which is several
orders of magnitude higher than that of organic dyes.27 Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) of the metal nanoparticles
exhibits intense color, which is highly sensitive toward its size,
shape, and interparticle distances.27,28 Interaction
of these nanoparticles with analytes causes aggregation and/or change
in size, shape, interparticle networking pattern, etc., resulting
in changes in SPR absorption band and color of the solution, which
is easily detectable by the naked eye even at low concentration.29−31 Because of this unique property
and also due to their simple and rapid action with high selectivity
and sensitivity, the use of nanoparticles as colorimetric sensing
material has become an emerging area of research. Among metal-based
nanoparticles, both gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) and silver nanoparticles
(AgNPs) are of particular interest because of their high sensitivity
and distinct color change, which can be noted even if a minor change
occurs in the nanoparticles’ environment.27,32,33 Between gold and silver, the latter has
been chosen in the present work to make it cost-effective as silver
is much cheaper than gold and silver nanoparticles are expected to
perform similar to gold nanoparticles.

In the present work,
silver nanoparticles were prepared with the aid of sunlight using
newly designed thiophene-substituted calixarene derivative (ThC) as
capping and stabilizing agent. It is documented in the literature
that bare-surfaced nanoparticles are prone to aggregate, and therefore,
some capping agent is required to make them discrete nanoparticles.23,26,34,35 In
this case, designed calixarene derivative incorporating thiophene
moiety is chosen as capping and stabilizing agent with the aim that
the sulfur atom of the thiophene unit connected to calixarene can
make strong interaction with the surface of the silver nanoparticles
making an effective capping, and this preorganized calixarene moiety
can provide platform for interaction with incoming analytes.36 These
calixarene-modified silver nanoparticles (ThC-AgNPs) have been used
for detection of metal ions in aqueous media, and it has been observed
that they detect Hg2+ with high selectively, sensitivity,
and sharp color change over 17 other metal ions used in this study.
They detect not only Hg2+ in aqueous media, but also Hg0 in vapor and liquid phases.

These ThC-AgNPs have also
been used for the detection of Hg2+ electrochemically using
amperometric technique, in which a constant potential of working electrode
is maintained and change in current is measured with incremental addition
of Hg2+.37,38 This amperometric method has
also detected Hg2+ in aqueous media with high sensitivity.
Herein, we report details of the synthesis of modified calixarene
and the preparation of calixarene-modified silver nanoparticles and
their application as colorimetric sensor for Hg2+ and Hg0 and amperometric sensor for Hg2+ with high sensitivity.

Results and Discussion
Synthesis and Characterization of ThC
The route followed
for the synthesis of ThC is depicted in Scheme 1, and characterization data such as IR, 1H NMR, electrospray mass spectrometry (ES-MS), and elemental
analysis (C, H, and N) are given in Experimental Section. Elemental analysis and the mass data obtained experimentally
are in excellent agreement with the values calculated on the basis
of the proposed composition of the compounds. The mass and IR spectra
of compound ThC are shown in Figures S2 and S3 (Supporting Information), respectively. The IR spectra exhibited
strong bands at 3385 and 1674 cm–1, which are assigned
to ν(OH) and ν(C=O).39 The 3-thiophene acetic acid ring of ThC exhibited bands at 1457
and 763 cm–1, which are due to C=C and Cα–H
of the ring, respectively.40 The 1H NMR spectra of the compound ThC are shown in Figure S4 (Supporting Information), which exhibited two doublets
at δ 4.23 and 3.54 (J = 13.54 and 13.54 Hz)
for the Ar–CH2–Ar methylene protons, suggesting
that the compound exists in cone conformation in the solution.41 The aromatic protons of the calix unit appeared
as two doublets and two triplets at δ 7.18 (d, J = 7.54 Hz), δ 7.06 (d, J = 7.61 Hz), δ
6.89 (t, J = 7.60 Hz), and δ 6.75 (t, J = 7.52 Hz), respectively, which supports the cone conformation
of the calix unit.41 The amide −NH
protons of ThC appeared at δ 10.22 and δ 9.03, and the
phenolic −OH protons appeared at δ 8.09. The CH2 protons connecting the phenolic oxygen atoms and amide moiety appeared
at δ 4.69. The methylene bridge (−CH2−),
which connected the amide unit and thiophene moiety, appeared at δ
3.64. The signals for CH protons at 2, 4, and 5 positions of the thiophene
ring appeared at 7.28 (s), 7.10 (d) and 7.36 (d), respectively. The
analytical and spectroscopic data are therefore consistent with the
proposed structure of the compound, shown in Scheme 1.

Synthesis
and Characterization of Silver Nanoparticles (ThC-AgNPs)
Thiophene-functionalized calix[4]arene-capped silver nanoparticles
(ThC-AgNPs) were synthesized with the aid of sunlight, as described
in Experimental Section. However, this
synthesis is highly sensitive toward different parameters and experimental
conditions used, for example, ratio of AgNO3 to ThC, ratio
of methanol to water, and time of exposure of the solution to sunlight.
Low concentration of AgNO3 or higher concentration of methanol
leads ThC-AgNPs toward aggregation. If exposure time of solution to
sunlight is about 1 h or more, a dark brown precipitate separates.
A number of experiments were carried out with variation in different
parameters, and the optimized parameters for the best result are mentioned
in the Experimental Section. An attempt
has been made to synthesize surface-modified AgNPs using AgNO3 and individual compounds, 3-thiophene acetic acid, oxalyldyhydrazide,
and 1,3-o-hydrazine calix[4]arene derivative, the
detailed experimental procedure of which is given in the Supporting
Information (Figure S5). However, the UV–vis
spectra of the product, shown in Figure S5 (Supporting Information), exhibit no nanoparticle formation. The
result thus suggests that ThC has a role to play in the formation
and stabilization of nanoparticles of desired size and is essential
for this reaction.

The functionalized nanoparticles, ThC-AgNPs,
were characterized on the basis of UV–vis, IR, X-ray diffraction
(XRD), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) studies. The UV–vis
spectra of ThC-AgNPs, shown in Figure 1, exhibit a strong band at 432 nm, which is the characteristic
SPR absorption band observed for AgNPs.26 The IR spectra of ThC-AgNPs (Figure S6, Supporting Information) exhibited that the bands at 1457 and 763
cm–1, which are due to C=C and Cα–H
of the thiophene ring of ThC, respectively, have almost disappeared,
indicating the involvement of thiophene ring in its attachment onto
the surface of the nanoparticles, probably through the sulfur atoms.
The band at 1674 cm–1, which was assigned to ν(C=O)
of ThC, has also splitted and shifted to 1637 and 1621 cm–1 due to attachment of ThC onto the AgNPs surface. Powder XRD pattern
of ThC-AgNPs was recorded by casting them on a glass plate and drying
under vacuum, and the diffractogram, shown in Figure 2, revealed the formation of silver nanoparticles
by showing the characteristic peaks at 2θ values of 38.13, 44.23,
64.43, and 77.46° corresponding to the 111, 200, 220, and 311
planes.23 The TEM image of ThC-AgNPs was
recorded and is displayed in Figure 3, which reveals that the nanoparticles are discrete,
not aggregated, and almost spherical in shape (Figure 3a) with average size of 3–5 mm (Figure 3b). Detailed analysis
of the high-magnification high-resolution transmission electron microscopy
(HRTEM) image exhibits continuous single directional lattice fringes
with interplanar distance of about 0.23 nm (Figure 3b), which corresponds to the [111] lattice
plane.42,43 Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX)
analysis of ThC-AgNPs was also carried out, and it shows the presence
of Ag0 and other elements present in ThC (Figure 3c).

Metal-Ion Sensing Study with ThC-AgNPs
To investigate
the metal-ion sensing property of ThC-AgNPs, they were allowed to
interact with metal ions such as Li+, Na+, K+, Cs+, Ca2+, Mg2+, Ba2+, Cr3+, Sr2+, Co2+, Ni2+, Cd2+, Zn2+, Rb+, Hg2+, Pb2+, and Cu2+ in aqueous media following
the procedure described in Experimental Section. The interaction with metal ions was followed by UV–vis spectroscopy,
and the spectral change upon addition of metal ions is compared to
that obtained without addition of any metal ion, as shown in Figure 4. It may be noted
in the figure that only for Hg2+, the SPR band disappeared
with distinct color change from yellow to colorless, as shown in the
inset of Figure 4.
For other metal ions used in this study, no significant spectral change
or considerable color change is noted. The result therefore suggests
that ThC-AgNPs function as a selective colorimetric sensor for Hg2+ in aqueous media. In the detection process, the possible
interference from other metal ions has also been examined using mixture
of metal ions following the procedure described in Experimental Section. The UV–vis spectral change upon
addition of mixture of metal ions is shown in Figure S7 (Supporting Information), and the bar diagram showing
the change in absorbance (432 nm) against mixture of metal ions is
shown in Figure 5.
The bar diagram clearly shows that there is no interference from any
other metal ions used in this study.

solution) recorded after 2 m upon addition of different metal ions
(1 mL, 2 mM). Inset: color of the solution of ThC-AgNPs after addition

change in the intensity of the absorption band of ThC-AgNPs (1.0 mL
of stock solution) at 432 nm (SPR) recorded after 2 m upon addition
of 0.5 mL (0.5 mM) of mercury and 0.5 mL (5.0 mM) of other metal ions.

Mechanistic Aspects of Hg2+ Sensing
It is well
documented that sulfur interacts strongly with surface of the silver
nanoparticles (Ag0);21,23 at the same time, Hg2+ forms a strong complex with sulfur atom as donor. In this
case, ThC is designed incorporating thiophene at the lower rim of
the calix unit with 1,3-alternate conformation so that calix moiety
can anchor onto the surface of the nanoparticles through the sulfur
atoms of the thiophene. There is no coordinating group/donor atom
at the upper rim of the calix unit, which prevented it to achieve
intermolecular interaction/aggregation through the upper rim, which
promoted to form discrete calix-capped nanoparticles (Figure S8). For the same reason, the added Hg2+ could not interact through the free upper rim of the calixarene
moieties forming network structure, resulting in aggregation of nanoparticles.
It is also documented that metal-induced aggregation is expected to
cause shift in SPR band with color change of the solution or a new
SPR band is expected to appear;22 however,
none of them is actually observed in this case. On the other hand,
as the Hg2+ can form strong complex with the sulfur atom
of the thiophene moiety, it can take away the calixarene molecules
from the surface of the nanoparticles by complexation leaving nanoparticles
with bare surface, which can aggregate and/or interact with free Hg2+ ions forming Ag–Hg amalgam. In such situation, the
material no longer can behave as discrete nanoparticles, and therefore,
the SPR band is expected to disappear, which is actually observed
(Figures 4 and 5). The stripping of calixarene from the surface
of the nanoparticles resulted in the formation of highly reactive
bare AgNPs, which were then reacted with free Hg2+ to form
Ag–Hg amalgam44,45 and also self-assembled by dipole–dipole
interaction resulting in aggregation.46,47 This phenomenon
is expected to change the size and shape of the nanoparticles.44−47 Experimentally,
it has been noted that upon addition of incremental amount of Hg2+, the intensity of the SPR band diminishes and finally disappeared
(Figure 6), which supports
the proposed mechanism.48−50 The TEM image of ThC-AgNPs was recorded after addition of Hg2+, and the image is shown in Figure 3d,e. It may be noted that the particles are
no longer in discrete spherical shape, and a close view shown in Figure 3e revealed that particles
are assembled forming rodlike shape, loosing discrete nanoparticle
nature, which is consistent with the observed disappearance of the
SPR band. EDX analysis of the particles obtained after addition of
Hg2+ into ThC-AgNPs, shown in Figure 3f, exhibits the presence of both Ag and Hg.
The experimental data therefore suggest that the mechanism of detection
involved displacement of ThC from the surface of the ThC-AgNPs because
of the strong interaction of Hg2+ with the sulfur atoms
of ThC, followed by the formation of Ag–Hg amalgam and AgNPs
self-assembly by dipole–dipole interaction of the bare-surfaced
nanoparticles, a schematic presentation of which is shown in Scheme 2.48−50 It may be noted that the EDX analysis after
addition of Hg2+ (Figure 3f) exhibited the presence of a significant amount of
(in %) carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur, which suggests that the
entire calixarene molecules from the surface of the nanoparticles
were not completely removed, and the interaction with Hg2+ or dipole–dipole interaction takes place through the bare
surface available for interaction.

concentration of Hg2+ showing the linear behavior in the
concentration range 20–900 nM (top) and the photographic image

of Hg2+ in aqueous media (bottom)).

Scheme 2 Schematic Presentation Showing the Mechanistic
Aspect of Hg2+ Sensing by ThC-AgNPs
According to the proposed
mechanism, the selectivity toward a particular metal ion depends on
the competency through which the metal ion can remove the calixarene
moiety from the surface of the nanoparticles making bare surface.
It is well known that Hg2+ has strong affinity toward sulfur
to form complex, and in the present case, Hg2+, among all
other metal ions used in this study, exhibited strong ability under
the experimental condition to form complex through the sulfur atom
of the thiophene ring, displacing calixarene moiety from the surface
of the nanoparticles. In support of this argument, an experiment was
carried out in which solution of Hg(ClO4)2 was
added into the methanolic solution of ThC, which resulted in immediate
precipitate of the Hg2+ complex of ThC, suggesting that
Hg2+ forms strong complex with the ThC. This is the main
reason in this case to exhibit selective detection for Hg2+.

Effect of pH on Sensing of Hg2+
The effect of pH on the detection of Hg2+ has been examined, and details of the experimental procedure are
in Experimental Section. The UV–vis
spectral change upon addition of Hg2+ in the range of 2–10
is shown in Figure S9a, and a bar diagram
showing the change in intensity of the SPR band (432 nm) as a function
of pH is presented in Figure S9b. The figures
show that the change in intensity of the SPR band in the presence
of Hg2+ increases significantly from pH 2 to 7, while in
the pH range of 8–10, the change is not significant, which
can be attributed to the less solubility of the perchlorate salt of
Hg2+ in that pH range. Therefore, ThC-AgNPs can be used
for the detection and quantification of Hg2+ in the pH
range of 2–7.

Spectrophotometric
Titration for Detection of Hg2+ by ThC-AgNPs
UV–vis
titration for the detection of Hg2+ was carried out following
the method described in Experimental Section to find out the limit of detection (LOD) and also the concentration
range, in which the plot exhibits linearity so that it can be used
for estimation of Hg2+ in a solution of unknown concentration.
The spectral change upon incremental addition of Hg2+ is
shown in Figure 6,
and the plot of change in absorption intensity (A0 – A) as a function of concentration
of Hg2+ is shown in the inset. The plot shows a linear
behavior in the Hg2+ concentration range of 20–0.9
nM, with a good linear correlation coefficient (R2) of 0.994. For the determination of LOD, the plot in
the lower-concentration region of metal ion has expanded and is shown
in Figure S10 (Supporting Information),
from which the LOD found is 0.5 nM (0.1 ppb), which is lower than
the permissible limit of Hg2+ in drinking water (10 nM,
2 ppb), according to the guidelines of the US-EPA and WHO.12 The LOD obtained is compared to some of the
recently published LOD data obtained by colorimetric method using
functionalized silver nanoparticles in aqueous media (Table 1). The LOD value of the present
study is comparable to or better than many recently published data.

Sensing of Hg0 in Solution
and Vapor Phases
The ability of ThC-AgNPs for the detection
of Hg0 in aqueous solution and in vapor phase has also
been examined, following the method described in Experimental Section. The UV–vis spectral change for
ThC-AgNPs in the presence of metallic mercury (Hg0) is
shown in Figure 7,
which exhibited that the SPR band at 432 nm disappeared and the color
of the solution also changed (inset of Figure 7). For vapor phase, the experimental setup
shown in Figure 8 clearly
shows distinct change in color when metallic mercury is heated at
380 °C, suggesting that ThC-AgNPs can also interact with Hg0 in vapor phase.

Amperometric
Detection of Hg2+ in Water
The electrochemical
behavior of ThC-AgNPs toward Hg2+ was studied by cyclic
voltammetry (CV) and amperometry following the procedure described
in Experimental Section. The cyclic voltammetry
curves of ThC-AgNPs solution with incremental addition of Hg2+ and at different scan rate with fixed amount of Hg2+ in
phosphate buffer solution (PBS) of pH 5.8 are shown in Figures S11 and S12 (Supporting Information).
CV with incremental addition of Hg2+ exhibits a new cathodic
peak at 0.92 V (Figure S11, Supporting
Information), which is attributed to the reduction of Hg2+ to Hg22+, as shown below.45,58 Electrode reaction:
 The CV with gradual increment of scan rate exhibited shifts of oxidation
peak toward positive potential and reduction peak toward negative
potential (Figure S12, Supporting Information).
The results suggest that this reaction follows the Randles–Sevcik
equation, according to which the peak current is directly proportional
to the square root of scan rate when other parameters are kept constant
(Figure S13, Supporting Information) and
thus the reaction is faradic in nature.59 The extrapolations of linear cathodic and anodic currents toward
the y-axis meet almost at zero, suggesting that very
low nonfaradic current is present in the system. The observation suggests
that the interaction of Hg2+ with ThC-AgNPs is recognized
by electrochemical response and it can be quantified by amperometric
technique.

The amperometric i–t curve is continuously recorded by successive addition
of Hg2+ separately in a homogenously stirred ThC-AgNPs
solution in 0.1 M PBS (pH 5.8) with applied potential of −0.035
V. Dynamic stairs due to decrease in current on each addition of Hg2+ with time interval of 60 s is shown in Figure 9. Steady-state current is obtained
in a few seconds, which promotes its applicability for the real-time
sample analysis. Decrease in peak current is observed to be proportional
to the concentration of Hg2+ in the range of 0.9–9
μM as shown in Figure 10. The detection limit calculated from Figure 10 is found to be 10 nM (2 ppb), which is
on the basis of minimum concentration of Hg2+ required
to decrease current.

current by dynamic stairs obtained during gradual addition of Hg2+ in ThC-AgNPs solution in PBS of pH 5.8. Inset: linear behavior

Analysis of Real
Samples
The performance of ThC-AgNPs for detection of Hg2+ in water, as well as Hg0 in soil as real samples
is checked. For Hg2+ in water, samples were collected from
the institute’s tap water source and drinking water source,
and these samples were analyzed for Hg2+ by inductively
coupled plasma mass spectrometry; however, no Hg2+ was
detected in these samples. These two samples were then spiked with
a known amount of Hg2+ and were treated as unknown samples.
These solutions were then added into the solution of ThC-AgNPs, and
their UV–vis spectra were recorded after 2 min of addition.
The difference in absorbance of the SPR band at 432 nm is used to
determine the concentration of Hg2+, as shown in Figure 11, and the linear
plot shown in Figure 6 is used. The amount of Hg2+ obtained and that added are
given in Table 2, and
the results are found to be satisfactory. It may be noted that not
only Hg(ClO4)2 but also other ionic salts of
Hg2+ can be determined using this method, as demonstrated
in Figure S14 (Supporting Information).

For detection of Hg0 in soil, a similar procedure is
followed; however, quantitative detection is difficult as preparation
of samples for analysis following spike method requires mixing of
Hg metal and soil in solid phase, which is a heterogeneous mixture,
and during the measurement, it is difficult to ensure 100% evaporation
of Hg0 from the mixture and transfer of entire amount of
Hg0 vapor produced into the solution of ThC-AgNPs. Eight
sets of samples were prepared by mixing around 2–16 mg of Hg0 and 500 mg of soil, which was dried in vacuum overnight,
and the samples were heated at 380 °C for 30 and 60 min and the
UV–vis spectra of the ThC-AgNPs solution were recorded. The
color change of the solution is shown in Figure 12, the UV–vis spectral change after
30 and 60 min, and the plots of absorbance change of the SPR band
as a function of the amount of Hg0 added for both the temperatures
are shown in Figures S15–S17 (Supporting
Information). Detection of Hg0 vapor by ThC-AgNPs is evident
from the color and absorption spectral changes with time and concentration;
however, quantification using present data will not be accurate for
the reason mentioned above, and weighing of submilligram (ppb, ppm)
quantity of Hg metal itself is difficult. However, this is a good
technique with high sensitivity for measurement of Hg0 in
solid material such as soil, etc., and can be used for semiquantitative
measurement.

of color is due to sensing of Hg metal).

Conclusions
In summary, a s imple route for the synthesis of calixarene-functionalized
silver nanoparticles (ThC-AgNPs) with the aid of sunlight is developed.
The thiophene-substituted calixarene moiety (ThC) was anchored onto
the surface of the AgNPs through the sulfur atoms of the thiophene
moiety. The metal-ion sensing property of the ThC-AgNPs, investigated
with a large number of metal ions with the aid of SPR absorption band,
revealed that it detects Hg2+ with sharp color change and
with high selectivity and sensitivity (LOD 0.5 nM) without interference
from any other metal ions used in this study. ThC-AgNPs also detect
Hg0 in solution and in vapor phase with sharp color change.
Mechanistic study for the detection of Hg2+ revealed Hg2+ induced displacement of anchored ThC-AgNPs from the surface
of the AgNPs, followed by formation of Ag–Hg amalgam and self-assembled
array of AgNPs due to dipole–dipole interaction of the bare-surfaced
nanoparticles. Hg2+ has also been detected by electrochemical
study using amperometric technique with high sensitivity (LOD, 10
nM). The new material is used to detect Hg2+ in aqueous
real sample and Hg0 in soil sample.

Materials and Methods
Materials
All chemicals were of analytical grade and were used without further
purification. p-tert-Butyl phenol
and NAOH were purchased from SRL; formaldehyde was purchased from
labort chemicals; anhydrous AlCl3 was purchased from Spectrochem;
methyl bromoacetate was purchased from Merck; hydrazine hydrate and
3-thiophene acetic acid were purchased from TCI; and AgNO3 was purchased from S. D. Fine Chemicals. Perchlorate salts of different
metal ions were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. All organic solvents
were of AR grade and were purchased from Fisher Scientific.

Methods
NMR spectra were recorded
on Avance II 500 Bruker FT-NMR instrument, mass spectra were recorded
on Q-TOF MicroTM liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC–MS)
instrument, Fourier transform infrared spectra were recorded on Agilent
Technologies Cary 600 series IR spectrometer, and elemental analysis
was carried out on Elementar Vario MICRO cube analyzer. Powder XRD
pattern was recorded on a PANalytical Empyrean Series 2 X-ray diffraction
system. HRTEM images were recorded on a JEOL JEM-2100 transmission
electron microscope. UV–vis spectra were recorded with Varian-500
spectrometer. All of the electrochemical measurements were carried
out on the Metrohm Autolab 203 potentiostat/galvanostat instrument.

Synthesis of Ligand
The starting
and intermediate compounds, p-tertiarybutyl calix[4]arene,60 calix[4]arene,61 1,3-o-dimethyl ester calix[4]arene derivative,62 and 1,3-o-hydrazine calix[4]arene derivative,63 were synthesized following the reported procedure.

Synthesis of Thiophene-Substituted Calix[4]arene
Derivative (ThC)
The compound 1,3-o-hydrazine
calix[4]arene was reacted with 3-thiophene acetic acid and EDC·HCl
to synthesize thiophene-substituted calix[4]arene (ThC). In a typical
procedure, 3-thiophene acetic acid (800.6 mg, 5.6 mM) dissolved in
dry acetonitrile (50 mL) was added to EDC·HCl (2.0 g, excess),
and the reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature under nitrogen
for 15 min. This solution was then added into 1,3-o-hydrazine calix[4]arene (800 mg, 1.40 mM) dissolved in dry acetonitrile
(150 mL), and the reaction mixture was stirrred at room temperature
under nitrogen atmosphere for 24 h. During stirring, a white precipitate
separated, which was then collected by filtration and washed three
times with Milli-Q water (50 mL) to remove excess EDC·HCl and
3-thiophene acetic acid, if any. The white product was then dried
under vacuum overnight in yield of 58%.

Synthesis of Silver Nanoparticles (ThC-AgNPs)
Silver nanoparticles were synthesized using ThC as stabilizing
agent. In a typical procedure, ThC (4.8 mg), dissolved in 1.0 mL of
methanol, was added into the aqueous (100 mL) silver nitrate (15.2
mg) solution with a AgNO3/ThC molar ratio of 1:15, and
the reaction mixture was stirred in 1% (v/v) methanol/water for 2
min to mix it well. The reaction mixture was then exposed to sunlight
for 35 min, during which the colorless solution became yellow. The
solution was then kept at room temperature for half an hour and then
stored at 4 °C for further use. To check the effect of temperature
during preparation of nanoparticles, preparation was carried out under
sunlight (with normal temperature under sunlight) at 50 and 80 °C.
It is observed that under all of these three experimental conditions,
nanoparticles were formed with almost equal efficiency, and there
is only a few nanometers difference in absorption maxima (SPR band
maxima at 432, 438, and 440 nM), which is probably due to slight differences
in particles size. Details of the experimental setup and absorption
spectra are shown in Figure S1 (Supporting
Information).

and 311 planes of face-centered cubic silver, with JCPDS no: 04-014-0266).

Metal-Ion Sensing Study
The performance of ThC-AgNPs
toward sensing of metal ions was investigated with the aid of UV–vis
spectroscopy. For this purpose, stock solution of ThC-AgNPs and aqueous
solutions of the perchlorate salts of the metal ions (2 mM), Cu2+, Li+, K+, Na+, Cs2+, Ba2+, Ca2+, Mg2+, Cr3+, Sr2+, Co2+, Zn2+, Rb+, Ni2+, Cd2+, Hg2+, Pb2+ were used. In a typical experiment, 1 mL solution of the ThC-AgNPs
was taken in a cuvette and 1 mL solution of a particular metal ion
was added into it and the UV–vis spectra of the resulting solution
were recorded. The experiment was repeated for every metal ion investigated.
The UV–vis spectra of ThC-AgNPs with and without metal ions
were then compared to measure the sensing property of the calixarene-modified
silver nanoparticles.

UV–Vis
Titration with Hg2+ Ion
The study on metal-ion
sensing revealed that ThC-AgNPs selectively interact with Hg2+ ion, which prompted us to conduct UV–vis titration to find
out the limit of detection (LOD) and also the concentration ranges
of the metal ion, in which the plot, ratio of absorbance as a function
of concentration of metal ion, exhibits linearity to use it for the
estimation of Hg2+ of the solution of unknown concentration.
For this titration, the same stock solution of ThC-AgNPs, as mentioned
earlier, was used and the solution of the perchlorate salt of the
Hg2+ was diluted appropriately to obtain the concentration
of 0.04–800 nM. Then, 1 mL of each solution of metal ion was
added into the solution of ThC-AgNPs (1 mL) in a 2 mL volumetric flask
to make effective concentration of metal ion in the solution 0.02–400
nM and UV–vis spectra of all of the reaction mixtures were
recorded.

Interference Study
To investigate the interference of other metal ions for selective
detection of Hg2+, competitive binding property of ThC-AgNPs
was examined with mixtures of Hg2+ and other metal ions
used in this study. In a typical experiment, 1 mL of ThC-AgNPs stock
solution was taken in a spectrophotometric cuvette and 1 mL of a mixture
of metal ions containing Hg2+ and 10 times excess of Hg2+ of a competitive metal ion such as Li+, Na+, K+, Cs+, Ca2+, Mg2+, Ba2+, Cr3+, Co2+, Ni2+, Cd2+, Rb+, Sr2+, Pb2+, Cu2+, and Zn2+ were added into the cuvette
and UV–vis spectra of the reaction mixture were recorded. The
changes in the absorbance intensity of the SPR band of ThC-AgNPs (432
nm) were then plotted against mixtures of metal ions.

Sensing of Hg0 in Solution and Vapor
Phases
Sensing of Hg0 in solution and vapor phases
was investigated using ThC-AgNPs. In a typical procedure of sensing,
mercury metal (Hg0, 1 gm) was added into a 2 mL solution
of ThC-AgNPs, and within 10 min, the color of the solution disappeared
and then UV–vis spectra of the solution were recorded. For
sensing in vapor phase, mercury metal (Hg0, 200 mg) was
filled in a glass vial and capped with a tube of polypropylene containing
2.0 mL of ThC-AgNPs. The glass vial filled with Hg0 was
then heated at 380 °C, which produces Hg0 vapor, which
was then allowed to pass through the neck of the glass vial and thus
the vapor came in contact with ThC-AgNPs solution filled in polypropylene
tube. The color of the solution changed from yellow to colorless,
indicating detection of Hg0 in vapor phase.

Warning
Hg vapor is highly toxic, and
it can damage the respiratory system. Therefore, experiment must be
carried out with adequate precaution.

Sensing of Hg2+ at Different pH
Sensing of Hg2+ using ThC-AgNPs at various pH values ranging from 2 to 10
has also been carried out. In a typical experiment, stock solution
of perchlorate salt of Hg2+ (2 mM) was prepared in different
pH in the range of 2–10, adjusted by either HCl or NaOH in
water. ThC-AgNPs (1 mL) were treated with the Hg2+ (1 mL,
2 mM) solutions of different pH, and after 2 min of addition, UV–vis
spectra of the reaction mixtures were recorded.

Sensing of Hg2+ by Electrochemical Method
Detection of Hg2+ in aqueous media was also examined
by cyclic voltammetry and amperometry in 0.1 M PBS (pH 5.8) at ambient
temperature. For this purpose, a conventional three-electrode system
consisting of Pt wire as working and counter electrodes and Ag/AgCl
in saturated KCl solution as reference electrode was used. Before
using the working and reference electrodes, platinum wires were dipped
in chromic acid solution to remove any kind of impurities deposited
on it. Electrodes were used without any coating and modification.
ThC-AgNPs, after 50% dilution with 0.1 M PBS (pH 5.8) and Hg2+ of 0.1 mM in 0.1 M PBS (pH 5.8), were used as a stock solution for
all electrochemical experiments. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was recorded
at a scan rate of 50 mV s–1 in the range of −1.2
to 1.2 V unless otherwise mentioned. All potentials were measured
vs Ag/AgCl (sat. KCl). CV of ThC-AgNPs (20 mL) solution was recorded
before and after incremental addition of 200 mL of Hg2+ solution with the same parameter mentioned above. Electrochemical
reaction in solution was assessed by measuring cyclic voltammetry
of ThC-AgNPs (20 mL) with fixed concentration of Hg2+ (2000
mL, 0.1 mM) at different scan rates from 50 to 500 mV s–1. The observations of scan rate study demonstrated increase of current
at the potential 0.035 V and shift with increase of scan rate toward
−0.2 V. Amperometric measurement with ThC-AgNPs (20 mL) solution
was carried out at the same potential on successive addition of 200
mL of Hg2+ (0.1 mM) with regular time interval of 60 s.
