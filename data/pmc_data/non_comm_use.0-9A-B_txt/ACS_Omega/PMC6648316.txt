In
this work, we report copper bromide (CuBr) as an efficient, inexpensive,
and solution-processable hole transport layer (HTL) for organic solar
cells (OSCs) for the first time. To examine the effectiveness of the
material in general, three different solvents such as acetonitrile
(MeCN), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), and dimethylformamide (DMF) are
used for solution-processing thin-film deposition of CuBr. CuBr thin
films deposited from different solvents show high transparency and
no significant difference has been observed in absorption in the visible
and near-IR range, whereas a slight difference has been found in the
near-UV range by changing the solvents. Furthermore, two most studied
combinations of the active layer such as PTB7/PC71BM and
PCDTBT:/PC71BM are used for device fabrication with geometry
of ITO/CuBr(HTL) active layer/Al. By using CuBr as a HTL in OSCs,
the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) have been achieved to up
to 5.16 and 4.72% with PTB7/PC71BM and PCDTBT/PC71BM active layers, respectively. The CuBr film from DMF solvent shows
highest PCE as compared to films deposited from DMSO and MeCN solvents.
Different solvents used for HTL deposition have a major effect on
the fill factor (FF), while very little difference on open circuit
voltage (Voc) and short circuit current
(Jsc) has been observed. It may be mentioned
here that a small difference of device parameters (PCE, FF, Jsc, and Voc) has
been observed in the devices using the HTL deposited from DMF and
DMSO solvents, whereas a significant difference of the device parameters
has been found in devices using the HTL from MeCN solvent.

1 Introduction
Solution-processable
organic solar cells (OSCs) have been widely studied because of their
easy fabrication process, cost-effectiveness, light weight, flexibility,
and large area as well as continuous improvement in their performance
by the use of new materials and device architectures.1,2 These cells based on a bulk heterojunction concept have been fabricated
with five different components such as indium tin oxide as an anode
electrode, hole transport layer (HTL), active layer (donor/acceptor),
electron transport layer, and low work function (WF) metals used as
a cathode electrode. It is a well-known fact that the performance
of OSCs is highly dependent on the interface between the conductive
electrode (anode or cathode) and active layer.3,4 An
interface layer, namely, HTL is inserted between the anode electrode
and active layer to improve the extraction and collection of charge
carriers as well as stability and performance of the devices. A wide
range of materials were used as HTLs in OSCs, out of which solution-processable
materials are the most attractive choice because of cost-effectiveness
and easy fabrication process. Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)/poly(styrenesulfonate)
(PEDOT/PSS) is a well-known and most widely used solution-processable
HTL material in the field of OSCs because of its high conductivity,
transparency, and suitable WF.5,6 While because of the
acidic and hygroscopic nature of PSS, it is a major cause of device
degradation and stability.7,8 To overcome this problem,
a series of new organic and inorganic alternative HTL materials have
been developed and investigated as a replacement of PEDOT/PSS such
as PSS-free PEDOT,9−12 small molecules, graphene oxide,13 carbon
nanotubes,14 polyaniline,15 and transition-metal oxides16,17 (V2O5, MoO3, NiO, etc.). The transition-metal
oxides have high air stability and optical transparency but insoluble
in most of the common organic solvents. Because of solubility issue,
these inorganic materials are usually deposited by vacuum deposition
techniques,18 which is an incompatible,
expensive, and more complicated procedure with the concept of cost-effective
large-area OSC fabrication. To overcome the issue of vacuum deposition
of inorganic HTLs, significant efforts have been studied for the development
of solution-processable materials. Consequently, solution-processing
methods have been reported by using different materials such as inorganic
precursors,19 nanoparticles,20 colloidal particles,21 and so forth. Indeed, several solution-processable metal oxides,
such as CuOx,22 MoOx,23−25 ReOx,26 VOx,27,28 NiOx,29,30 SnOx,31 WO3,32 and RuOx33 have been reported for relatively
stable OSCs. Likely, these materials have issue on relatively poor
solubility, required specific solvents, toxicity, and shortage, which
limits their possible commercial applications. Therefore, an alternative
is required to develop a new cost-effective and efficient solution-processable
HTL for OSCs. In particular, high solubility and earth-abundant HTL
materials may be promising candidates for cost-effective photovoltaic
applications.

Recently, a new series of copper-based materials
such as copper iodide (CuI) and copper thiocyanate (CuSCN) have been
introduced as solution-processable, robust, and highly transparent
HTL materials for efficient OSCs.34 Indeed,
CuSCN is an excellent solution-processable HTL for OSCs reported in
many studies,35−37 but solubility of CuSCN in nasty solvents (diisopropyl
sulfide) has limited its general applications. Solution-processable
CuI has also been reported in the literature38−42 as a HTL in OSCs, while most of the studies have
reported on poly(3-hexylthiophene)/[6,6]-phenylC61-butric
acid methyl ester (P3HT/PC61BM)43-based OSCs as a replacement of PEDOT/PSS.38,39 Very recently, Zhang et al. reported a thermal deposition of combination
of CuBr2 and MoO3 as a HTL of inverted-type
polymeric solar cells.44 Kim et al. reported
the templating effects on the growth of the organic molecules by using
the thermal deposition CuCl, CuBr, and CuI, possessing different lattice
spacing by thermal deposition.45 Zhao et
al. used CuBr salt to enhance the conductivity of PEDOT/PSS and used
for OSCs based on PCDTBT/PC71BM.46 With respect to the transition metal-based HTL on OSCs, practically
nothing is known about solution-processable CuBr as a HTL in OSCs.
It is noteworthy to mention that Müllen-Buschbaum and co-workers
reported that the influence of the solvents on the thin-film morphology
and structure should be resolvable by volume-sensitive methods.47 They were extensively investigated by the effect
of solvent on the morphology and volume of the thin film for OSCs
and vertical and lateral phase separation have been found during spin-coating
and annealing temperature depending on the solvent.47 Furthermore, the effects of solvent on the interface and
active layer in OSCs have also been reported in several publications.48

Here, for the first time, we have reported
a solution-processable CuBr as an efficient, inexpensive, and solution-processable
HTL for OSCs. The effectiveness of the material was examined by using
three different solvents [acetonitrile (MeCN), dimethyl sulfoxide
(DMSO), and dimethylformamide (DMF)] for solution-processing thin-film
deposition. The CuBr thin films deposited from different solvents
were characterized by UV–vis spectroscopy and atomic force
microscopy (AFM). For better understanding, two most studied combinations
of active layers such as PTB7/PC71BM and PCDTBT/PC71BM were used for device fabrication with the device geometry
of ITO/CuBr (HTL)/active layer/Al.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Optical Measurement
Absorption spectra of solution-processed CuBr films in different
solvents were performed on quartz substrates to understand the absorption
in the range of the solar spectrum. CuBr films exhibit the absorption
in the UV region (around <500 nm) as shown in Figure 1a. There is no significant
difference observed in absorption spectra in the visible and near-IR
range, whereas a slight difference has been found in the near-UV range
by changing the solvents because solvents do not change the optical
properties but change the morphology of the films. Therefore, it is
clear that the CuBr films show lower parasitic absorption which makes
them efficient HTLs for OSCs to further improve the power conversion
efficiency (PCE).

Figure 1 (a) Absorption and (b) transmission spectra of CuBr thin
film from different solvents.

Similarly, transmission spectra of CuBr films deposited with
different solvents on quartz substrates are shown in Figure 1b. All these films deposited
in different solvents are quite similar and show high transparency
in the range of 300–1100 nm. CuBr films show high transparency
around ∼87%, which was comparable or even better compared to
PEDOT/PSS, CuI, CuSCN, and other transition-metal oxides. The transmittance
of the CuBr films reduces slightly in the UV region (>300 nm).
High transmittance of CuBr (HTL) films makes it a potential candidate
for OSCs.

2.2 Computational Results
Energy-level
alignments of the materials used for photovoltaic application play
a very crucial role in Voc, Jsc, excitons dissociation, charge transport, and collection
as well as on the device performance. Especially, the work function
of the HTL has a potential role on charge transport and collection.
The energy levels of optimized materials (see Supporting Information) such as CuBr along with CuI and CuSCN
were calculated at the B3LYP/3-21G level of theory. It is notable
that, in contrast to many ab initio methods (such as MP2, CISD, CCSD,
etc.), the B3LYP level is always well acceptable for the predication
of energy levels. The calculated highest occupied molecular orbital
(HOMO), lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO), HOMO–LUMO
gap, and bond distance of these molecules are presented in Table 1 and Figure 2.

Figure 2 HOMO and LUMO energies
of HTL materials calculated at the B3LYP/3-21G level of theory.

a Estimated work function from calculation.

b Experimental work function.

The calculated band gaps (at B3LYP/3-21G)
of CuBr, CuI, and CuSCN are 2.22, 2.16, and 2.30 eV, respectively,
with HOMO levels −5.34, −5.37, and −5.80 eV,
respectively (Table 1). It was observed that the HOMO level of CuBr is slightly lower
(0.03 eV) than that of CuI, whereas it is about 0.46 eV lower compared
to CuSCN (Figure 3).
The experimental work functions of CuI and CuSCN are 5.10 and 5.35
eV, respectively,36,49 while calculated HOMO levels
are −5.37 and −5.80 eV, respectively, shown in Table 1. Therefore, such
calculation systematically overestimates the HOMO level of CuI and
CuSCN by ∼0.3–0.4 eV because the B3LYP method apparently
does not consider the sufficient electron correlation to correctly
predict the energy levels.

Figure 3 Energy band diagram of the photovoltaic materials.

If a correction of only 0.27 eV
(like CuI) is applied between experimental and calculated values,
then the estimated work function of CuBr is 5.07 eV as shown in Table 1. The energy band
diagrams of the materials used in study along with CuBr, CuI, and
CuSCN are presented in the Figure 2. Therefore, CuBr may be a better hole extraction layer
because of its slightly higher lying work function (5.07 eV) compared
to other most studied HTL materials like PEDOT/PSS (5.20 eV), CuI
(5.10 eV), and CuSCN (5.35 eV).

Moreover, CuBr can easily restrict
the transport of electron to the anode electrode because of its higher
lying LUMO level than the LUMO levels of active materials PCDTBT,
PTB7, and PC71BM. It is noted that both CuBr and active-layer
materials like PCDTBT and PTB7 are hydrophobic in nature, which may
offer good compatibility and ordering to decrease the contact resistance
between the active layer and HTL.

To examine the effectiveness
of CuBr as an important solution-processable HTL material for OSCs,
we consider conventional device geometry ITO/HTL/active layer/Al as
presented in Figure 4. Two most important donor polymers PTB7 and PCDTBT blended with
PC71BM were used as the active layer for device fabrication.
The chemical structures of these materials are also presented in Figure 4.

2.3 Photovoltaic Device Characteristics Result
To study the performance of CuBr as an HTL, we have fabricated
conventional device structure ITO/CuBr/active layer/Al. The concentration
of the CuBr solution and thickness of the HTL were optimized (conditions
are mentioned in Experimental Section) to
reach the maximum possible efficiency of the device. The optimization
process is used throughout the further study. Figure 5 displays the current density voltage (J–V) characteristics of the CuBr-based
device using PTB7/PC71BM as an active layer under illuminations
(Figure S5 for J–V curve under dark). The OSC results of these devices extracted
from the J–V measurements
are presented in Table 2. To investigate the effect of solvents on the device performance,
three different solvents (DMF, DMSO, and MeCN) were used. We found
that the CuBr thin film that was deposited from DMF solvent as a HTL
in the device shows the highest PCE of 5.16% with short-circuit current
(Jsc), open circuit voltage (Voc), and fill factor (FF) are 14.62 mA/cm2,
0.72 V, and 50%, respectively, as presented in Table 2. While CuBr thin films were deposited from
DMSO and MeCN solvents show slightly lower PCE of 4.81 and 4.25%,
respectively.

 	MeCN	9.50	0.80	43.5	3.30 (±0.19)	
In order to
further examine the effectiveness of CuBr as a solution-processable
HTL on device performance, another well-studied donor polymer PCDTBT
was selected for our further study. In this study, the optimized concentration
of CuBr was used for the device fabrication with the same device geometry
and the three solvents. Figure 6 shows the J–V characteristics
under illumination conditions, respectively, and the dark curve (Figure S6) shows diode characteristics. Similar
to a previous study, the DMF solvent device exhibits the highest PCE
of 4.72% with Jsc, Voc, and FF being 10.04 mA/cm2, 0.87 V, and 53.9%,
respectively, as presented in Table 2. However, the CuBr thin films that were deposited
with DMSO and MeCN show lower PCE of around 4.51 and 3.30%, respectively.
It may be mentioned here that for comparison purpose, devices were
fabricated without using the HTL under identical conditions as described
above, and very poor PCE ∼0.37 and ∼0.26% have been
achieved in device configuration of ITO/PTB7/PC71BM/Al
and ITO/PCDTBT/PC71BM/Al, respectively, as presented in Figure S7.

Figure 6 J–V characteristics of PCDTBT/PC71BM devices under illumination
conditions.

It was observed that
under identical conditions, all the devices show very good performance,
while the CuBr HTL deposited with DMF solvent exhibits best results
as compared to the layer deposited from DMSO and MeCN solvents in
both of active-layer combinations. Interestingly, we found that the
HTL deposited from three different solvents has significant effects
on the FF, whereas it has very little effect on Jsc and Voc. However, the devices
that were fabricated using the HTL deposited from DMF and DMSO have
slightly higher FF compared to the device using HTL deposited from
MeCN solvent. This may be due to the surface morphology of the HTL
films arising during film deposition from different solvents. It may
be mentioned here that a small difference of device parameters (PCE, Jsc, FF, and Voc)
has been observed between the devices made from DMF and DMSO solvents,
whereas a significant difference of the device parameters has been
found when the device was prepared from the MeCN solvent. This may
be due to the lower boiling point of MeCN as compared to the DMF and
DMSO.

2.4 Surface Morphological Result
We have
investigated the morphology of the CuBr-deposited HTL from different
solvents to understand the slight variation of cell parameters (PCE, Jsc, FF, and Voc)
of the devices. AFM images were recorded of the HTLs deposited from
different solvents on ITO substrates. The AFM images of ITO/CuBr (DMF),
ITO/CuBr (DMSO), and ITO/CuBr (MeCN) are shown in Figure 7. It may be mentioned here
that the FF of the device depends on the morphology of the HTL. From
these images, we have clearly seen the changes in film morphology
by changing the deposition solvents of the HTL, but the difference
is not noticeable. However, the CuBr film deposited from DMF solvent
has a relatively smoother surface as compared to DMSO and MeCN solvents
because the average roughness values of CuBr films deposited from
DMF, DMSO, and MeCN solvents are 2.71, 5.33, and 8.81 nm, respectively.
The smoother interface between CuBr and active layers may allow for
better contact; as a result, it improves the device performance (Jsc, FF, and Voc)
as well as efficiency of the device. Despite the surface morphology,
the volume of the thin film is also important for the performance
of the OSC because of the thin-film volume corresponding to the size
of the layer and domains and thereby of the typically active area
of the device and related to exciton generation, diffusion, dissociation,
and charge transport.47

ITO/CuBr (DMF), (middle) ITO/CuBr (DMSO), and (right) ITO/CuBr (MeCN).

3 Conclusions
In conclusion, for the first time, we have demonstrated CuBr as
a solution-processable, efficient, and inexpensive inorganic HTL
for cost-effective OSC fabrication. The CuBr thin film deposited from
different solvents are highly transparent. The importance of CuBr
as a common hole transport material was examined by device fabrication
of OSCs based on two well-reported donor materials PTB7 and PCDTBT.
The resulting devices based on CuBr as a HTL show comparable PCE as
previously reported traditional HTLs such as PEDOT/PSS, CuI, CuSCN,
and so forth. To understand the importance of the material in general,
three different solvents—DMF, DMSO, and MeCN—were used
for solution-processing thin-film deposition. We found that the HTL
deposited from three different solvents show very good performance.
We have shown that the deposition solvents of the HTL in solar cells
have a major effect on FF, whereas they have a minor effect on Jsc and Voc, although
the difference of the device parameters (PCE, Jsc, FF, and Voc) are significant
for the device using the HTL deposited from MeCN solvent. The reason
behind this observation is the surface morphology of the CuBr film
in different solvents and volatile nature of solvents. The key advantages
of solution-processable CuBr as a HTL are high transparency, easy
deposition, nontoxicity, and low cost, which are essential for possible
large-area OSCs.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Reagents and Materials
The polymers poly[N-9″-heptadecanyl-2,7-carbazole-alt-5,5-(4′,7′-di-2-thienyl-2′,1′,3′-benzothiadiazole)
(PCDTBT) and poly[4,8-bis[(2-ethylhexyl)oxy]benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiaphene-2,6-diyl][3-fluro-2-[(2-ethylhexyl)cabonyl]thieno[3,4-b]thiophenyldiyl]] (PTB7) and acceptor phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) were purchased from
Ossila Limited, United Kingdom. Copper bromide (CuBr) and solvents
such as 1,2-dichlorobenzene (DCB), chlorobenzene (CB), diiodooctane
(DIO), MeCN, DMSO, and DMF were purchased from Sigma Aldrich. All
these commercially available chemicals were used without further purification.

4.2 Preparation of the CuBr Layer as HTLs
CuBr
material (50 mg) was dissolved in 5.0 mL solvent and the combined
mixture was sonicated for 2 h at room temperature. After sonication,
the resulting suspension was capped for 30 min at room temperature.
The insoluble portion of the mixture settled down. The clear solution
of the upper layer was used for solution-processable HTL deposition
in OSCs.

4.3 Preparation of Active-Layer Solution
Here, the devices were fabricated using two most studied active layers
of PCDTBT/PC71BM and PTB7/PC71BM. Donor polymer
PCDTBT and acceptor PC71BM were used in a 1.0:4.0 w/w ratio
and dissolved in mixture solvents of CB and DCB (1.0/3.0 v/v). The
concentration of the solution is 35 mg/mL. Another donor–acceptor
combination PTB7/PC71BM was used (ratio 1.0:1.5 w/w) and
dissolved in a solution of DIO in CB (ratio 3.0:97.0 v/v). The concentration
of the solution is 25 mg/mL. Both the active-layer solutions were
stirred for 12 h at room temperature before being used.

4.4 Device Fabrication Process
ITO-coated glass substrates
(∼12 Ω/cm2) were used as an anode for device
fabrication. The laser ablation method was used to pattern the ITO
on the glass substrate. The patterned ITO-coated glass substrates
were cleaned by soap solution followed by boiling acetone, trichloroethylene,
and isopropanol. Finally, the substrates were dried under vacuum for
20 min. Then, the CuBr (∼35 nm) thin film was deposited on
the cleaned substrates by spin-coating at 3000 rpm for 60 s from the
three different solution of CuBr. The resulting HTLs were baked on
the hot plate at 100 °C for 15 min and then drying for 1 h at
room temperature. The active layer (∼70 nm) was deposited by
spin-coating with 1000 rpm for 90 s onto the HTL and annealed for
10 min at 70 °C on a hot plate inside the glovebox (inert condition).
The final cathode electrode of Al (∼110 nm) was thermally deposited
on the active layer. The completed devices were then transferred for
the characterization.

4.5 Characterization
The absorption and transmission of CuBr thin films were recorded
by a UV-1800 Shimadzu spectrophotometer. The film morphology of CuBr
films deposited from different solvents on ITO-coated glass substrates
was measured by atomic force microscopy (AFM) NT-MDT Solver Pro. The J–V measurements of the devices
were performed using a Keithley 2400 source meter. A solar simulator
(AM 1.5 G) and incident power (100 mW/cm2) were used for
device characterization.

4.6 Computational Details
Density functional theory with the B3LYP hybrid functional50 and the 3-21G basis set was used for all theoretical
calculations. The Gaussian 03 program was used for all computations.
The structures of the molecules were fully optimized using a hybrid
density theory.
