As
a high value-added product from biomass pyrolysis, wood vinegar
(WV) has been used as a growth regulator for many plant species in
agriculture based on the diverse active chemical compounds present.
To reveal the relationship between chemical constituents and regulation
performance, four kinds of WVs were prepared by slow pyrolysis from
Chinese fir waste at different temperature ranges. The chemical constituents
of WVs were analyzed by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry,
and the regulation performance of WVs was investigated from the aspects
of seed germination and root growth of wheat. The results indicated
that the chemical constituents of WVs were affected obviously by pyrolysis
temperature and the major components were acids and phenols. All types
of WVs showed regulation performance but with different effects and
levels. The WV collected from 20 to 150 °C exhibited a promoting
effect and other three WVs exhibited inhibiting effects. It was considered
that the regulation performance of WV was relevant to acids and phenols
through a synergy mechanism. Acids caused intercellular acidification
and increased root activity, which promoted the seed germination and
root growth, while phenols increased the content of malonaldehyde,
indicating that phenols caused the oxidative stress to damage cell
structure and inhibit growth. All these results could be a reference
for further utilization of WVs as a sustainable alternative to chemicals
for plant growth regulation in agriculture.

==== Body
1 Introduction
In recent years, with
the aggravation of environmental pollution
and shortage of fossil energy, the utilization of biomass energy has
attracted people’s attention. The full estimated potential
of annual biomass production from agriculture and forestry is nearly
1.08 × 1011 tons.1,2 Biomass, considered
as the environment friendliness and renewability resource, can be
converted to liquid fuels, combustible gases, biochars, and high-quality
chemicals by the thermochemical and biochemical approaches.3 Therefore, the main concerns are the comprehensive
utilization of biomass and the conversion technologies that convert
biomass into high value-added products.

Chinese fir, also named Cunninghamia lanceolate (Lamb.) Hook, with a huge
planting area and distribution, is widely
used as a raw material for furniture and wood fiber industries. However,
a larger quantity of branches and leftover materials as biomass waste
were produced from the furniture and wood industries, which affected
the living and production environment. In order to improve the utilization
of Chinese fir waste (CFW), appropriate measures should be taken to
convert the branches and leftover materials to useful products.

Pyrolysis has received special attention because it offers efficient
application of biomass, especially for vastly available biomass byproducts
and waste. It is generally defined as thermal decomposition of biomass
under anaerobic conditions, leading to the formation of gases, liquid
products, and biochars.4,5 Generally, the pyrolysis process
takes place at temperatures of 300–1200 °C, and the resultant
yields depend on many factors such as operating conditions, biomass
types, and so forth. Thangalazhy-Gopakumar et al. investigated the
effect of temperature on bio-oil quality using pine wood and the results
showed that the highest yield has been obtained at 450 °C; the
contents of phenols and derivatives increased as the temperature increased
from 425 to 500 °C while that of guaiacol and derivatives decreased.6 Ingra et al. investigated the physical and chemical
properties of liquid products produced at 450 °C, with mass yields
of 48–55% for pine wood, 49–56% for oak wood, 42–44%
for pine bark, and 43–50% for oak bark.7

Wood vinegar (WV), as one of the main liquid products of biomass
pyrolysis, consisted of many complex organic components and compounds.8 WVs were considered potentially valuable chemicals
that could be used as soil amendments, pesticides, food additives,
and so forth.9−11 Agriculture is one of the most important application
fields of WVs. Recently, the research studies on the application of
WVs in agriculture were quite intensive, mainly focusing on the antimicrobial
properties, pesticidal effects, and so forth. Mmojieje et al. prepared
WV from mixed wood biomass and investigated its pesticidal effects
on the red spider mite and green peach aphid, which showed that WV
exhibited more than 90% mortality for both pests.12 Lashari et al. found that WV has a beneficial effect on
leaching soluble salts, decreasing the soil pH and resulting in the
improvement of crop productivity in saline soils.13 Many studies report the regulatory effects of WVs on seed
germination and plant growth in sustainable agriculture. Pan et al.
found that WV had significant effects on the germination and growth
of crop seed, which varied with the concentration of WV, preparation
conditions, and seed types.14 Xu et al.
found that the different concentrations of bamboo vinegar inhibited
the seed germination and seedling growth of tobacco, but spraying
100–400 times bamboo vinegar solution on leaves promoted growth
and improved the quality.15 WVs exhibited
the regulatory effects on seed germination and plant growth, but the
effects are dependent on the WV properties, concentration, and plant
species.16 However, no reports have been
found to investigate the influence of pyrolysis temperatures on the
properties of WVs from CFW. Furthermore, the study of the relationship
between chemical constituents and regulation performance of WVs is
still lacking.

On the basis of the above discussion, the aim
of this paper was
to study the physical–chemical properties of WVs prepared from
CFW and investigate the relationships between chemical constituents
and regulation performance of WVs, providing a better guidance for
efficient application of WVs in sustainable agriculture.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Properties of WVs
The WVs were collected
at different pyrolysis temperature ranges, and four samples were obtained.
The properties of WVs are shown in Table 1. In general, with the increase of pyrolysis
temperature, the yields of WVs first increased and then decreased,
and the maximum yield reached to 34.09% in WV-2. As we know, biomass
materials were mainly composed of cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin.
The increase of temperature promoted the pyrolysis process, which
led to an increase in yield. However, the pyrolysis process was gradually
completed and part of volatile gas was formed in secondary pyrolysis
to form noncondensable gas under higher pyrolysis temperature, which
resulted in a significant reduction of yield. The moisture content
decreased with the increase of temperature because the fracture of
aliphatic hydroxyl in the lignin structure and the dehydration of
cellulose were extreme at lower temperature and subdued at higher
temperature, leading to the reduction of moisture content under higher
temperature.17 Both pH and density of WVs
showed no significant difference, which remained steady at 2.75–3.08
and 1.011–1.044 g/mL, similar to the WVs obtained from giant
seed and walnut shell.18,19

Table 1 Properties
of WVs from Four Temperature
Ranges
WVs	pH	density (g/mL)	moisture
content (%)	yield (%)	
WV-1	3.04	1.011	85.61	15.47	
WV-2	2.90	1.036	54.55	34.09	
WV-3	3.08	1.039	52.03	3.50	
WV-4	2.75	1.044	51.73	0.50	
Gas chromatography (GC)–mass
spectrometry (MS) was used
to study the chemical compositions of WVs, and the relative peak area
represented the relative content of chemical components. The main
chemical components in WVs at different temperature ranges are shown
in Figure 1. The detailed
information of different chemical components presented in the Supporting
Information is classified into five groups, including acids, phenols,
ketones, aldehydes, and alcohols. As shown in Figure 1, the same chemical components in WVs were
identified, but the distribution and contents were varied. Acids and
phenols were the major components for all WVs, which accounted for
15.35–64.84% and 30.09–56.17%, respectively. The relative
contents of alcohols were less than 6%. It could be seen that the
pyrolysis temperature had a significant effect on the chemical compositions
of WVs. For WV-1, acids and phenols were the major components, which
accounted for 94.93%. The main components were phenols, acids, aldehydes,
and ketones in WV-2 while phenols, ketones, and acids in WV-3. In
WV-4, phenols, acids, ketones, and alcohols were the main components.

Figure 1 Relative
content profiles of five groups of chemical compounds
at different pyrolysis temperatures.

The relative content of acids was highest in WV-1, which decreased
first and then increased with the increase of temperature. This was
due to the fact that hemicellulose and lignin dehydrated to form small
molecular acids at low temperature, while cellulose and hemicellulose
degraded to produce macromolecular acids at high temperature. For
phenols, defined as the major degraded products of lignin, the relative
content increased and then decreased, which exhibited the highest
relative content in WV-3. In general, the pyrolysis temperature of
lignin was in a wide temperature range of 200–550 °C,
but the most intense pyrolysis temperature range was 280–420
°C. Ketones were derived from the depolymerization of polysaccharides
and the isomerization of monosaccharides on hemicellulose at high
pyrolysis temperature, while alcohols were ascribed to the breakage
of the side chain of aliphatic alcohol hydroxyl in lignin. Cellulose,
hemicellulose, and lignin all produced aldehydes during pyrolysis.20,21

A total of 32 chemical components in WVs were identified and
shown
in Table 2. The main
components of acids were aliphatic acids and phenolic acid, obtained
from the depolymerization of cellulose, pyrolysis of hemicellulose,
and breakage of fat hydroxyl in lignin. The major phenolic substances
were guaiacol and its derivatives, followed by benzenediol and its
derivatives. The alkyl side chains of the phenylpropane structure
of lignin contained hydroxyl functional groups, which produced phenolic
substances by dehydration during the pyrolysis process.22 Therefore, it could be concluded that the phenylpropane
structure of lignin in CFW was mainly of guaiacol-based type. Ketones
contained acetone, methoxyacetophenone, cyclopentanedione, and their
derivatives, which were formed from the pyrolysis of cellulose and
hemicellulose. Furfural and hydroxymethyl-furfural were the major
components of aldehydes. Furfural was the typical degradation product
of xylan in hemicellulose and hydroxymethyl-furfural was generated
by the degradation of the glucosyl group in cellulose.23 Methoxy-phenethyl alcohol was the main alcohol
in WVs, which may be due to the degradation of the side-chain structure
of the aliphatic alcohol hydroxyl group in lignin.24

2.2 Effects of WVs on the Germination of Wheat
Seed
The seed germination potential (SGP), defined as the
important index for indicating the seed germination speed and viability,
was used in this study to reveal the effects of WVs on SGP, and the
results are shown in Figure 2. It could be seen that the effects of different WVs on SGP
were obvious. Compared with the sterile water without WV (CK), the
SGP increased when treated with WV-1 and decreased when treated with
WV-2, WV-3, and WV-4. It also manifested that the SGP was influenced
by the culture time. In the first 3 days, the influences of different
WV treatments on SGP were not obvious. However, the SGP began to show
a significant difference from the fifth day with the extension of
culture time. These results indicated that WVs could promote the seed
germination but could not break the dormancy of seed and make them
germinate earlier. Consistently, the results of this study were consistent
with those of Chang et al.25

Figure 2 Effects of
WVs on SGP of wheat seed treated with CK, WV-1, WV-2,
WV-3, and WV-4. Different small letters represent significant difference
among the different WV treatments, which were analyzed by SPSS20.0
(P < 0.05).

Table 3 shows the
detailed germination characteristics of wheat seed treated with WVs.
The seed germination rate (SGR) increased significantly by 43.13%
in WV-1 and decreased by 7.84, 29.41, and 17.65% in WV-2, WV-3, and
WV-4 treatments, respectively, compared with that in CK. The variation
trend of seed germination index (SGI) was similar to SGR and sequenced
as WV-1, CK, WV-2, WV-4, and WV-3. Moreover, the relative SGR (RSGR)
revealed the effects of WVs on the germination rate of wheat seed,
where the positive numbers indicated the promotion effect and the
negative numbers indicated the inhibitory effect. It manifested that
WV-1 exhibited a promotion effect, while WV-2, WV-3, and WV-4 exhibited
an inhibitory effect. WV-1 with the SGR of 60.83% had the highest
promotion effect. These results indicated that WVs can be used as
a conditioning agent in sustainable agriculture.

WV-4	12.50b	26.67c	35.00c	–17.65	0.49d	
2.3 Effects of WVs on Root Growth of Wheat
The main root length (MRL), lateral root number (LRN), root uniformity
(RU), and total fresh root mass (TFRM) are the major morphological
characteristics, which could be used to evaluate the growth of root.
The main root is the major part of the plant root system and helps
plant to absorb water and nutrients from deep soil, the lateral root
and RU are the important parts that affect the specific surface area
of the root system and root activity, and TFRM indicates the healthy
degree of the plant root growth. In this study, we selected the four
indicators as the morphological characteristics of root, and the results
are shown in Figure 3. The MRL (Figure 3a) was affected obviously by different WVs. Compared with CK, the
MRL was the longest and reached to 10.5 cm by the treatment of WV-1,
which increased nearly 1.2 times, while it was reduced to 3.55 cm
with the treatment of WV-3. The MRL increased by the treatment of
WV-1 and decreased by the treatments of WV-2, WV-3, and WV-4. Figure 3b shows the effects
of WVs on LRN. As shown, the LRN increased to 105 when treated with
WV-1, which was 1.5 times that of CK, and it decreased to 46 when
treated with WV-3. The effects of WV-2 and WV-4 on LRN were not significant.
Consistently, the RU and TFRM exhibited similar trends to MRL and
LRN (Figure 3c,d).
These results indicated that WV-1 promoted the growth and development
of the wheat root system, while other WVs (WV-2, WV-3, and WV-4) exhibited
inhibitory effects. For the development of the root system and growth
of plant, both water and nutrients in soil play important roles. Organic
acids, phenols, and other organic compounds are typical allelochemicals,
which regulate plant growth via affecting ion absorption, respiratory
metabolism, hormone balance, and protein synthesis.26−28 The WVs, which
are obtained from different feedstock and pyrolysis conditions, contained
different kinds and contents of chemical substances and exhibited
different regulation performances on root development and plant growth.

LRN (b), RU (c), and TFRM (d) of wheat culture treated
with CK, WV-1, WV-2, WV-3, and WV-4. Different small letters represent
significant difference among the different WV treatments, which were
analyzed by SPSS20.0 (P < 0.05).

2.4 Effects of WVs on Root Vigor of the Wheat
Root System
Root system is an important absorption and metabolic
organ of plants. The development of the root system was directly affected
by the crop yield and the growth of shoots and leaves above ground.
Root vigor (RV), a comprehensive index reflecting the absorption function
of the root system, refers to the metabolic activity of the root system.
Therefore, RV has become an important index in the study of the root
system. Figure 4 shows
the impact of RV treated with WVs. It can be seen that the RV of the
root was affected obviously by WVs and the order indicator sensitivity
to RV with different WV treatments was WV-1 > CK > WV-2 >
WV-4 > WV-3.
Compared with CK, the RV increased to 92.75 μg/g·h in WV-1
treatment and decreased to 72.48, 62.45, and 48.91 μg/g·h
in WV-2, WV-4, and WV-3 treatments, respectively. Coincidentally,
Liu et al. stated that the wheat straw extract and decomposition liquid,
which contained the similar contents with WV such as phenolic acids,
exhibited the regulatory effects on the RV and respiratory action
of the cotton root system and affected the growth of root.29 In addition, organic compounds such as phenolic
acids showed different allelopathic effects on the rice root system,
which had important effects on RV and plant growth.30 In general, plant root was affected by allelopathic substances,
stress, irrigation, soil, and other environmental conditions, which
led to the change of root metabolism and activity and affected their
growth. WV contains a large amount of organic compounds, and the type
and contents of organic compounds are considered as the key factors
that influence the regulatory effects of WV.

Figure 4 RV of wheat culture treated
with CK, WV-1, WV-2, WV-3, and WV-4.
Different small letters represent significant difference among the
different concentrations of WV treatments, which were analyzed by
SPSS20.0 (P < 0.05).

2.5 Oxidative Stress for Root Growth Caused by
WVs
The production and accumulation of malonaldehyde (MDA)
in target cells are frequently used as an indicator to assess oxidative
stress condition and contaminant toxicity to organisms. Under stress
condition, continuous accumulation of MDA will lead to cell deterioration
and cell membrane damage. Therefore, the higher MDA content indicates
the greater cell damage, which is considered as a disadvantage to
the plant growth. The impacts of WVs on the contents of MDA in wheat
root are shown in Figure 5. The MDA content was highly dependent on the kinds of WVs.
Treated with WV-1, the MDA content decreased to 0.00925 μmol/g,
which was reduced nearly 13% compared with CK groups. The MDA in WV-3
treatment significantly increased by 1.4 times and reached to 0.01485
μmol/g, while it had little changes in WV-2 and WV-4. These
results indicated that WV-3 exposure triggered MDA overproduction
in root cells and was the stress condition for root growth. The increase
of MDA content may be due to the oxidation stress induced by excessive
reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation by WV-3 exposure.31 It was also reported by Guo et al. that the
MDA content in Microcystis flos-aquae increased by the gallic acid,
which was due to excess ROS accumulation resulting from oxidative
stress.32 Overall, the increased content
of MDA indicated that the wheat root cells suffered an intense oxidative
stress caused by the treatment of WVs, leading to lipid oxidation
and root growth inhibition.33

MDA of wheat culture treated with CK, WV-1, WV-2, WV-3,
and WV-4. Different small letters represent significant difference
among the different concentrations of WV treatments, which were analyzed
by SPSS20.0 (P < 0.05).

2.6 Correlation Analysis on Chemical Compounds
and Regulatory Effects of WVs
In order to investigate the
relationship between chemical constituents and regulatory effects
and to discuss the mechanism, correlation coefficient analysis was
used in this study. Table 4 shows the analysis on correlation coefficient between chemical
components in WVs with germination and growth indices. For seed germination,
acids were positively correlated with SGR and SGI, while phenols and
ketones were negatively correlated with SGR and SGI; aldehydes and
alcohols were not significantly correlated with SGR and SGI. As for
root growth indices, acids were positively correlated with LRN and
RV; ketones were negatively correlated with PRL, LRN, and TFRM; and
alcohols were negatively correlated with MRL and TFRM. Phenols exhibited
a significant negative correlation with all growth indices. As shown
in the component analysis, acids and phenols were the main components
in WVs, which accounted for 70–95% of the total components.
Especially in WV-1, acids and phenols accounted for about 95%, and
WV-1 showed the strongest promotion effect. It could be concluded
that acids and phenols played important roles in regulatory effects
rather than ketones, aldehydes, and alcohols.

Treated with WVs, H+ which is provided
by acids broke
the physical interaction between xyloglucan and other compounds in
the cell wall, which helped H+ to enter the cells and increased
organic acid to cause intercellular acidification. Intercellular acidification
made the cells more prone to division and differentiation, thus promoting
the increase of RV and the development of the root system. Furthermore,
there were abundant phenolic compounds in WV. Phenolic compounds exhibited
the hormesis effect as stimulation at lower concentration and the
inhibition at higher concentration. The mechanism involving increased
free radicals and activated protease led to the cell proliferation
in low concentration while decreased the activities of enzymes and
inhibited the growth in high concentration.34,35 Meanwhile, different phenols exhibited different regulatory effects,
which reported that monophenol inhibited plant growth and diphenol
or polyphenol promoted plant growth.36 Phenols
in WV-1 were mainly diphenol, such as 1,2-benzenediol, 3-methyl-1,2-benzenediol,
and 4-methyl-1,2-benzenediol, while in other WVs, especially in WV-3,
phenols were primarily monophenol, such as 2-methoxy phenol, 4-ethyl-2-methoxy
phenol, and 4-propyl-2-methoxy phenol. The balance and concentration
of different phenols affected the plant growth, which was considered
as the high concentration, and breaking the balance of phenols would
decrease the RV and increase the MDA content that damaged cell structure
and led to the disadvantage of plant growth.

In addition, we
further studied the correlation between RV, MDA,
and growth indices, and the results are shown in Table 5. The RV, as an indicator of
plant growth activity, was negatively correlated with MDA and was
positively correlated with MRL, LRN, RU, and TFRM. This result indicated
that the higher content of RV promoted the growth of the root system,
especially for principal root growth. MDA was negatively correlated
with MRL, RU, and RV. There were many factors that interfered and
damaged the structure and function of the membrane in plant growth,
and lipid peroxidation was one of the important factors. MDA, the
final product of lipid peroxidation, affirmed the indicator of the
degree of stress and reflected the accumulation of harmful substances
in plant cells under stress condition. The higher the content of MDA,
the greater the damage degree of cell membranes.37,38 Under stress condition, the root adapted to stress by an increase
in respiration. However, the long high-intensity respiration would
consume a large number of carbohydrates and then reduce the respiratory
rate because of the insufficient respiratory substrates. Furthermore,
reduction of the respiratory rate may cause the decrease of root metabolism
and ATP production, which could not meet the needs of root growth,
thus leading to the decrease of RV and inhibition of growth.39

3 Conclusions
In this study, the physicochemical
properties of WVs from the pyrolysis
of CFW were studied, and comprehensive assessment of chemical constituents
and regulation performance was also investigated. With the increase
of pyrolysis temperature, the yield of WVs increased first and then
decreased, and WV-2 reached the maximum yield of 34.09%. GC–MS
analysis of WVs showed that the chemical compositions of WVs were
significantly affected by the pyrolysis temperature and the acids
and phenols were the most dominant components. WVs obtained under
four temperature ranges exhibited different regulation performances
on seed germination and root growth. Compared with CK, WV-1 promoted
the seed germination and root growth, whereas WV-3 inhibited the seed
germination and root growth. The correlation analysis results indicated
that the regulation performance was relevant to acids and phenol contents,
which show that acid substances exhibited a promoting effect and phenolic
substances exhibited an inhibiting effect. The regulatory effects
were studied through a synergy mechanism which influenced the changes
of RV and MDA caused by acids and phenols in WVs.

Overall, this
paper underlined the interest for a clear understanding
of the relationship between chemical constituents and regulation performance
of WVs. This knowledge helps to select suitable WVs for the best application
in sustainable agriculture and provides a promising way for biomass
waste utilization.

4 Materials and Methods
4.1 Materials
The CFW used in this study
was the residues generated in the utilization process (especially,
furniture industry), which were collected from Jiangxi (China) and
smashed into small pieces (0.5–2.0 mm). All of the chemical
reagents used in this study were of analytical grade and purchased
from local chemical stores.

4.2 Preparation and Characterization
of WVs
Slow pyrolysis process was used in this study to obtain
WVs, and
the schematic diagram is shown in Figure 6. To maintain an inert atmosphere, N2 with a flow rate of 100 mL/min was fed into the reactor during
the pyrolysis process. CFW samples (20 g) were loaded in the middle
of the tube in a vacuum tube furnace (VTL 1200, China) and pyrolyzed
from the initial temperature to the target temperature with a heating
rate of 10 °C/min and maintained for 30 min to ensure complete
pyrolysis. A pipe with pyrolytic smoke was connected to a 0 °C
ice bath and applied to collect WVs at different temperature ranges
by means of a condenser. With the four temperature ranges, the WVs
were collected and placed in brown bottles and kept in dark. WV-1
indicates that the WV was obtained at the temperature range from 20
to 150 °C, WV-2 from 150 to 250 °C, WV-3 from 250 to 350
°C, and WV-4 from 350 to 450 °C.40,41 Three parallel experiments were performed for each pyrolysis condition.

meter; (3) quartz tube; (4) VTL; (5) temperature controller; (6) condenser.

The density of WV was measured using an optical
density meter,
pH was measured by a pH meter (PHS-3CHS, INESA, China), and the moisture
content was measured using a moisture analyzer (ZSD-2J, Anting, China).
The chemical composition was characterized using GC–MS (7890A-5975C,
Agilent, Palo Alto, USA) equipped with an HP-5 column (30 m ×
0.05 μm × 0.32 nm). The following conditions were used
for GC analysis: initial temperature 50 °C for 2 min, ramped
at 5 °C/min to 280 °C and held for 20 min, a split ratio
of 100:1, and injected sample of 0.2 μL. The MS analysis was
obtained under 230 °C at 70 eV. The relative contents of compounds
were calculated by corresponding peak areas.42

4.3 Regulatory Effect of WVs
The culture
experiments were used to study the regulatory effects of WVs on the
seed germination and root growth of wheat. The wheat seeds were sterilized
using 75% ethyl alcohol solution and washed with sterile water 2–3
times before the test. Next, 1 mL of different WVs was diluted in
4000 mL of sterile water to obtain the culture solutions; sterile
water without WV was denoted as sample CK. The culture experiments
were carried out under a light/dark cycle of 12:12 h at 28 ±
1 °C for 7 days in an intelligent incubator (KBWF-720, Binder,
Germany). For every culture experiment, 30 wheat seeds were placed
in a watch glass (d = 9 cm) with two filter papers,
and different WV culture solutions were added under sterile conditions
with three conducted repetitions.

4.4 Morphological
and Physiological Characterization
The morphological characteristics
used in this study were SGR,
SGP, RSGR, SGI, MRL, LTN, TFRM, and RU. The SGR, SGP, RSGR, and SGI
were analyzed following the methods of Yu et al.:30 SGR (%) = n/N ×
100% (where n is the number of germinative seeds
at the final period of germination and N is the total
number of experimental seeds), SGP represents the 3rd day, 5th day,
and 7th day of SGR, SGI = (SGRt × MRLt)/(SGRCK × MRLCK) (where t is represented for treating
with WVs, while CK stands for CK groups). The cornier caliper was
used to measure the root length; thereby, the MRL was obtained and
the RU was calculated as the ratio of >1 cm root number to the
total
root number. The MDA content was assayed according to the thiobarbituric
acid (TBA) method, and RV was analyzed following the triphenyltetrazolium
chloride (TTC) method.43

4.5 Statistical Analysis
The culture
experiment data were analyzed using analysis of variance (ANOVA),
and the results were expressed as the mean values of three repetitions
with standard deviation. Different small letters in tables and figures
indicate the significance of the various parameters with different
concentrations of WV treatments. The correlation was analyzed using
a Pearson test at P < 0.05 by means of SPSS 20.0.
