The
development of micro- and nanofibril cellulose to improve strength
while reducing the side effects of toughness and water resistance
can benefit integrated polymer performance. Inspired by the interior
microstructure of mussel byssus, this paper proposed an efficient
means of generating an active block microfibrillated cellulose/polyurethane
elastomer using an epoxy monomer as a pre-crosslinked agent with the
addition of a poly(dopamine) layer. The block elastomer served as
a multifunctional crosslinker, constructing a covalent network and
interfacial hydrogen bonding that interlinked the elastomer with a
soy protein isolate (SPI) matrix. Compared with the pristine SPI film,
the introduction of the block elastomer induced remarkable improvements
in tensile strength and toughness (146.7 and 102.1%, respectively).
Additionally, the block elastomer was employed to further estimate
its reinforcing effect in SPI resin modification, which also exhibited
favorable water resistance and adhesion performance. This strategy
may provide a new approach for constructing superior elastomers to
reinforce applicable biomass composites.

1 Introduction
Biobased materials may
allow tomorrow’s engineers to tap
renewable feedstocks instead of petrochemical resources.1,2 Despite significant progress in biobased polymers for various application
fields, some shortcomings persist, especially in terms of mechanical
performance compared to petroleum-based materials.3−5 The introduction
of nanofillers as a reinforcement phase for polymers has been shown
to be a facile and effective strategy to improve the mechanical properties
of composites.6,7 The incorporated various nanofillers
can serve as the reinforcing center to accelerate the composite transformation
of an amorphous and/or semi-crystallized structure into a crystallized
structure to obtain enhanced mechanical performance of biomaterials.8,9 However, most nanofillers are nonbiodegradable, opposing the concept
of green and sustainable biobased materials. As one of the most abundant
biopolymers in nature, cellulose can be obtained from multiple sources
such as plants, bacteria, or tunicates ranging in size from macroscale
to nanoscale; cellulose has been employed as an environmental reinforcing
filler in an array of polymers.10,11 Similar to other nanofillers,
cellulose nanofillers exhibit poor interfacial activity, thus, limiting
the movement of molecular chains for stress concentration and reducing
the ductility of biomaterials.

Nature provides a wealth of inspiration
to remedy the above problems.
As a typical biological material, mussel threads display a superior
combination of strength and ductility.12 Such superior strength is reportedly due to the formed dense dopamine-Fe(III)
crosslinkers, while high ductility is the result of crosslinking molecules
that induce a flexible granular microphase-separated structure in
the continuous protein matrix.13,14 Researchers have explored
the structure of strong and ductile composites by mimicking the granular
microphase-separated structure in the polymer matrix.8,15,16 Song et al. designed a facile
biomimetic microphase-separated nanostructure in a polyvinyl alcohol
matrix by introducing a sulfonated styrene–ethylene/butylene–styrene
triblock copolymer, achieving a remarkably strong and tough composite.17 For block copolymers, stress can be transferred
through the bridging chains from one entangled domain to its neighbors,
thus preventing crack propagation within the entire polymer and improving
the integrated mechanical performance.18,19 Meanwhile,
the block copolymer can self-assemble into a granule microphase-separated
structure in the waterborne composite matrix due to the strong competitive
hydrophilic–hydrophobic interactions that endow the matrix
with superior toughness.17 In practice,
however, the development of a block polymer with regulable chain architecture
and morphology has been proven to be challenging.

Polyurethane
(PU) is a family of block copolymers composed of alternating
soft and hard segments, forming a microphase-separated structural
assembly owing to thermodynamic incompatibility.20 PU has been used effectively in polymer enhancement and
operates via the same modification mechanism as the block copolymer.21,22 Recent research has revealed that the introduction of nanofillers
could optimize the microphase-separated structure of PU, which exhibits
more interconnected hard phases and markedly enhances the mechanical
properties of the materials.23,24 As such, various micro-
and nanofibrils have been applied to improve PU performance, mainly
through water-dispersible reinforcement incorporation.25,26 To further modify the interfacial interaction, cellulose derivatives
have been surface-modified by various groups and presented as reactants
to be synthesized directly into PU chains.27 In this way, the modified cellulose derivatives, as hard segments,
can be grafted onto PU molecular chains to construct a generalized
polymer-filler block copolymer, which can then optimize the PU microstructure
and provide a new avenue by which to synthesize a biobased block high-performance
elastomer. Although many studies have focused on the regulation and
improvement of the interior microstructure of PU, few have investigated
and modified the interfacial activity of PU to realize better interactions
with composites.

To address the aforementioned problems, the
present authors propose
a reactive pre-crosslinked block PU elastomer by in situ polymerizing
functionalized microfibrillated cellulose (MFC) into PU chains with
an epoxy monomer as a pre-crosslinking agent. This method will improve
inferior crosslinking and the microphase-separated structure and increase
the interfacial reactivity of the PU elastomer. The objectives of
this study are to determine the effect of the epoxy monomer on PU
interfacial activity and to investigate the synergistic effect of
the epoxy monomer and functionalized MFC-grafted PU elastomer on integrated
mechanical performance and interfacial activity. Accordingly, a poly(dopamine)
(PDA)-coated MFC nanofiller (PM) was in situ polymerized onto PU chains
via the PDA versatile reactive platform to construct a block PU elastomer;
then, the epoxy monomer was introduced to improve PU interfacial activity
to produce the PM/epoxy/PU (PMEU) pre-crosslinked reactive block elastomer.
To verify the reinforcement effects, soy protein isolate (SPI),1 as a kind of aforementioned sustainable and processible
biomass, was selected as the polymer matrix to develop SPI/PMEU (SPMEU)
protein-based composites. The microstructure and interfacial properties
of PMEU pre-crosslinked block elastomer hybrids and the mechanical,
thermal, and water-resistant properties of SPMEU composites were also
examined.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 PM Characterization
A facile dopamine
dip-coating method was used for the surface modification of MFC. Catechol
groups of dopamine underwent a self-polymerization process, forming
an adherent PDA layer that then served as a versatile reaction platform
to increase the interfacial activity of the polymer.28 The physical characteristics and chemical structure of
PM were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), thermogravimetric
(TG), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS).

SEM results of MFC and PM were compared as shown in Figure 1a. The unmodified
MFC exhibited a random orientation distribution with a diameter in
the range of 5–10 μm, whereas the modified MFC was seemingly
coated with a polymer layer indicating successful adhesion of the
PDA layer. The TG results (Figure 1b) showed a difference in residual weights of 24.75%
for MFC and 23.65% for PM along with a clear difference in the region
of 200–300 °C, primarily attributable to PDA-layer degradation.

Figure 1 Characterization
of PM fillers: (a) SEM images, (b) TG curves,
(c) FTIR spectra, (d–f) XPS wide scan and C 1s core-level spectra
of MFC and PM.

FTIR spectra confirmed
successful coating of the PDA layer on the
MFC surface. As shown in Figure 1c, new absorption peaks appeared at 1515 and 1456 cm–1 in PM particles associated with N–H and C–H
bonds, respectively, indicating the presence of the PDA layer.3 Additionally, the absorption peak of the C–H
bond at 1423 cm–1 shifted to a lower region, whereas
the peak of the C–O bond at 1032 cm–1 shifted
toward a higher region.29 It was suggested
that the incorporation of PDA changed the chemical environment of
atoms on the MFC. The XPS measurement was performed to further investigate
the chemical components of MFC and PM as shown in Figure 1d–f. The wide PM scan
(Figure 1d) shows a
clear peak of N elements and C–N bonds at the C 1s PM spectra
(Figure 1f), implying
that MFC was successfully surface-modified by PDA.

2.2 Construction of PMEU Elastomer
A
polyurethane prepolymer, which was isocyanate-terminated, was dispersed
in the functionalized PM suspension to in situ polymerize PM onto
polyurethane and construct the block polymer. The epoxy monomer was
then employed to enhance the inherent crosslinking degree and interfacial
activity for an active pre-crosslinked block elastomer (Scheme 1). The construction of the
PMEU elastomer was confirmed by FTIR and TG analyses.

Scheme 1 Illustration
of the Synthetic Procedure of the Pre-Crosslinked Block
PMEU Elastomer and Crosslinking Mechanism in the SPI Matrix
In the FTIR spectra (Figure 2a), the EU elastomer
exhibited absorption peaks at 3319, 2858,
1713, and 1532 cm–1, attributed to the N–H,
C–H, C=O and N–H, and C–N groups, respectively.30 For the MEU, the peaks at 3319 shifted to 3323
cm–1, mainly due to hydrogen bonding between −OH
of MFC with N–H and C–H groups of polyurethane chains.23,26 Comparatively, two new bands at 2741 and 998 cm–1 were observed in PMEU, suggesting that the PDA layer caused PM to
graft onto the polyurethane prepolymer via chemical reactions. Meanwhile,
the peaks at 1713 and 1532 cm–1 shifted to 1708
and 1536 cm–1, respectively, indicating strong hydrogen
bonding of the PDA layer with polyurethane chains. The shift and increase
in intensity of the peak at 2858 cm–1 was thought
to result from the ring-opening reaction of epoxy groups with a PDA
layer, leading to an increase in −CH2 groups.15 Therefore, the PDA layer of PM caused MFC to
graft onto the polyurethane prepolymer for the block elastomer and
provided reaction sites to accelerate the introduction of epoxy groups
into the elastomer to obtain the pre-crosslinked block elastomer.

Figure 2 FTIR spectra
(a) and TG degradation curves (b) of the pre-crosslinked
block elastomer.

TG measurement was performed
to further verify the interactions
within the PMEU block elastomer (Figure 2b). EU reflects the two-step degradation
stages of hard segments in the low-temperature region followed by
soft segments in the higher-temperature region.31 Enhanced thermal stability was observed for MEU per smaller
degradation rate caused by the crystalline effects of the filler and
the presence of a hydrogen bonding network structure.20 A
significant improvement in thermal stability was observed in the PMEU
elastomer, which showed more residual mass at all stages, a lower
degradation rate, and a higher maximum degradation temperature. The
enhanced thermal properties can be attributed to the PDA layer causing
MFC to react with the polyurethane prepolymer, constructing a high-performance
block elastomer. The PDA layer may have also acted as a crosslinking
site for strong interactions with the epoxy monomer.32 The interactions between the block elastomer and the SPI
matrix were certainly notable.

2.3 Interactions
between PMEU and SPI Matrix
FTIR measurement was applied
to pristine and modified SPI-based
films to investigate the interactions between PMEU and SPI molecules.
In Figure 3a, characteristic
peaks of SPI were observed at 3283 cm–1 (O–H
and N–H stretching vibration), 1651 cm–1 (C=O
stretching vibration of amide I), 1544 cm–1 (N–H
bending of amide II), and 1238 cm–1 (C–H
and N–H stretching of amide III).8,33 Compared to
the pristine SPI film, the main changes in the FTIR spectra of SPMEU
films were located within 3000–3500 cm–1,
mainly due to hydrogen bonding. The absorption peak at 1651 cm–1 also blue-shifted toward a relatively higher wavenumber
after incorporating the PMEU block elastomer owing to intermolecular
hydrogen bonding between the elastomer and SPI.21 In addition, the absorption peak at 2928 cm–1 shifted to 2932 cm–1 because new −CH2 groups formed due to the chemical reactions between the epoxy
groups of PMEU and −NH2 groups of SPI molecules,34−36 collectively indicating the presence of multiple interactions between
PMEU and SPI.

Figure 3 (a) FTIR spectra, (b) solid-state 13C NMR spectra,
(c)
X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns, and (d) TG degradation curves of
pristine and modified SPI composites.

The active PMEU elastomer reacted with SPI chains constructing
multiple crosslinked networks as further confirmed by 13C NMR measurement. Noticeable peaks corresponding to carbonyl (160–180
ppm), aromatic (115–130 ppm), α-carbon (45–70
ppm), β-carbon (25–45 ppm), and methylene and methyl
groups (15–25 ppm) of the SPI backbone were observed as shown
in Figure 3b.37 Compared to the pristine SP composite, new peaks
for polyurethane-modified SPI at 26.9 and 70.3 ppm corresponding to
the methyl carbon of isophorone diisocyanate (IPDI) and −C–CH2–OH groups revealed that polyurethane exhibited satisfactory
compatibility and crosslinked SPI through the ring-opening reactions
of epoxy groups.38,39 Meanwhile, the signal at 134.9
ppm for SPI lost its resolution after introducing polyurethane, which
could because the residual isocyanate groups formed interactions with
SPI molecules. Moreover, in SEU, the new resolution at 41.8 ppm could
be explained due to the fact that EU further reacted with SPI via
ring-opening of epoxy groups forming aliphatic CH2 groups.40 After further incorporating the PMEU elastomer,
another new peak at 44.8 ppm was observed possibly because of the
fact that the PDA layer reacted with SPI via Schiff base reactions
forming double bond groups,8,41 in accordance with
FTIR results.

The interactions between PMEU and SPI were also
evidenced by the
XRD data. As mentioned in previous studies, in Figure 3c, the diffraction peaks at approximately
8.5 and 20.0° were attributed to α-helix and β-sheet
structures of SPI molecules.32 After the
introduction of the PMEU pre-crosslinked block elastomer, nearly no
changes appeared compared to pristine SPI, indicating that PMEU did
not significantly affect the SPI structure.

TG analysis was
used to further confirm the effective interactions
in the SPMEU films as shown in Figure 3d and Table 1. Pristine SPI mainly exhibited two-step degradation: glycerol
degradation in the lower-temperature region, and backbone peptide
degradation in the higher-temperature region.42 After incorporating the MEU block elastomer, the degradation peak
around 170 °C decreased and a new peak appeared around 240 °C,
indicating a favorable combination and effective interaction between
MEU and SPI.43,44 Significantly enhanced thermal
stability was observed in the SPMEU film compared to the control samples.
The first degradation peak of SPI disappeared, and the maximum degradation
temperature increased with the addition of PMEU as shown in Figure 3d and Table 1, possibly because multiple
interactions formed and accelerated heat consumption. These results
confirm strong interactions between the PMEU and SPI matrix, which
were supported by the FTIR, XRD, and NMR results.

To some extent, the
surface morphology of a composite reflects
the interaction properties of a filler in its matrix as confirmed
by SEM images (Figure 4). The pristine SPI exhibited a scale-like morphology with a rough
fractured surface as shown in Figure 4a.43 The surface of the
SEU film (Figure 4b)
presented a relatively dense and smooth cross-section morphology with
sheet-like structures and fiber-like polymers appearing on the film
surface. The EU formed strong interfacial interactions with SPI via
a ring-opening reaction of epoxy groups, thus improving the interior
network structure; the microphase-separated structure of EU could
then disperse stress in the SPI matrix.21,36,45 After the addition of the MEU elastomer (Figure 4c), the sheet-like
structure increased because MFC was used as hard segments to optimize
the microphase-separated structure of the elastomer and improved the
mechanical performance of the SPI-based film.20,24 However, the unmodified MFC was pulled out, forming several pits
due to weak surface activity. After incorporating PMEU into the SPI
matrix (Figure 4d),
some fibers embedded in the matrix were again pulled out, and the
surface presented a dense multi-layer structure. These observations
suggested improved interfacial interactions in the SPMEU films.

and (d) SPMEU films.

2.4 Applied Performance of SPMEU Composites
2.4.1 Mechanical Properties
As two important
mechanical parameters, tensile strength (TS) and toughness were examined
to further determine the effects of the PMEU block elastomer on the
mechanical defects of the SPI-based film. As shown in Table 2 and Figure 5a,b, the pristine SPI exhibited TS, elongation
at break (EB), and W values of 5.05 MPa, 128%, and 5.82 MJ/m3, respectively.3,8 After the addition of the EU elastomer,
the TS and W values increased to 8.09 MPa and 8.33 MJ/m3 because the existence of active groups (e.g., epoxy groups) formed
crosslinking reactions with SPI while the interior microphase-separated
structure and particle cavitation effect of EU enhanced the toughness
of the composite.35,36,46 Compared to the SEU film, the introduction of the MEU block elastomer
markedly increased the TS and W values to 10.11 MPa and 9.03 MJ/m3 because the MFC served as hard segments to optimize the microphase-separated
structure and caused the physical crosslinking network, which enhanced
the integrated mechanical properties of the SPI-based films.20,47 Unfortunately, the weak surface activity of MFC led to a higher
stress concentration under force, which was not conducive to toughness
as confirmed by the SEM images of SMEU in Figure 5c.

For the SPMEU films, PDA caused the MFC to graft onto polyurethane
and form a strong block elastomer rife with hard domains and a favorable
microphase-separated structure.16,48 Meanwhile, the PDA
served as a versatile platform that could interact with the epoxy
monomer, thus enhancing the crosslinking degree of PMEU.3 Most importantly, the formation of abundant hydrogen
bonding between PMEU and SPI played a role in sacrificial units dissipating
energy and smoothing out the stress concentration, which contributed
to the integrated improvement of mechanical performance.49 As expected, the addition of PMEU increased
TS and W values by 146.7 and 102.1% compared to the pristine SPI film,
indicating a considerable improvement to address the mechanical drawbacks
of the pristine SPI film as supported by the SEM images of SPMEU (Figure 5d) with pulled-out
fibers.

Dynamic mechanical analyses (DMA) analysis was carried
out for
the SPI-based films (Figure 6) to further determine the reinforcing effects of the PMEU
elastomer on the SPI composite. In the storage modulus (E′) diagram, SPI exhibits a relatively small E′ at low temperatures but higher E′
at high temperatures. The introduction of EU formed a robust crosslinking
structure with SPI molecules to significantly increase E′; however, the addition of MEU decreased E′ due to the poor surface activity of MFC, reducing the limitations
of polymer chain mobility.20,22 Compared to the control
groups, the modulus of the SPMEU film was much higher with the same
addition, mainly because the interactions between the PMEU block elastomer
and SPI increased the inherent crosslinking degree and reduced the
mobility of polymer chains in the SPMEU film.50 The introduction of PMEU also decreased the loss factor in the composites
while increasing the glass transition temperature (Tg), reflecting an improvement in the interfacial interactions
of SPMEU films.

Figure 6 (a) Storage modulus and (b) Tan Delta of neat SPI and
modified
SPI films.

Although adhesives represent another
important application field
of SPI, poor adhesive and water-resistant properties render SPI unsuitable
for load-bearing engineering materials. To further confirm the high-performance
of the PMEU pre-crosslinked block elastomer, PMEU was applied in modifying
the SPI adhesives by the process of hot-pressing under 120 °C
and 1.0 MPa for 315 s. The wet shear bonding strength of SPI-based
adhesives modified by the PMEU elastomer is shown in Figure 7. The introduction of PMEU
produced a much better-performing adhesive compared to the same addition
of the EU or MEU elastomer. The PDA layer likely served as a particularly
versatile interface to react with the polyurethane prepolymer and
produce a robust block structure while also interacting with the epoxy
polymer to enhance the interior crosslinking degree and interfacial
activity of the elastomer.3,36,50 The incorporated PMEU provided multiple interaction sites to form
a strong crosslinking structure with the SPI molecules.

Figure 7 Wet shear strength
of SPI-based adhesive plywood samples with different
amounts of EU, MEU, and PMEU elastomers (the number represents the
addition percentage of total adhesive weight).

When the PMEU was added in the range of 1–3 wt %,
the wet
shear strength of the protein adhesive increased to 1.35 MPa marking
an increase of 118% compared to the pristine SPI adhesive, which also
meets the industrial plywood production standard for interior applications
(≥0.7 MPa).42 This change was mainly
attributed to the formation of multiple interactions between the PMEU
elastomer and SPI, preventing moisture intrusion to improve the material’s
water-resistant properties. However, the wet shear strength decreased
to 1.27 MPa upon the increased addition of PMEU to 5 wt % of the SPI
content, related to the competition reaction mechanism of active groups
of the PDA layer/polyurethane and −NH2 groups of
SPI with the epoxy polymer.36,40Figure 8 illustrates the reinforcement mechanisms
of SPMEU films and adhesives reinforced by the PMEU pre-crosslinked
block elastomer.

Figure 8 Enhancement mechanism in SPMEU composites.

2.4.2 Water Resistance of SPI-Based
Composites
Total soluble matter (TSM) and water contact angle
(WCA) measurements
were conducted to investigate the effects of the block PMEU elastomer
on the water resistance and surface hydrophilicity of pristine and
modified SPI-based films (Table 3). The incorporation of EU, MEU, and PMEU led to a
notable increase in WCA values; these activated polyurethane elastomers
formed interactions with SPI, which consumed the surface hydrophilic
groups and enhanced surface hydrophobicity.51 The TSM of pristine SPI films declined by 11.2% after the addition
of the PMEU block elastomer. This could be explained due to the fact
that the PDA layer in PMEU induced MFC to react with the polyurethane
prepolymer to form a superior block elastomer. The incorporated epoxy
monomer further improved the crosslinking degree and interfacial activity
of the PMEU elastomer, which accelerated the connection with the SPI
chain for a strong crosslinking network, significantly enhancing the
water-resistant properties of SPI-based films.34,36

3 Conclusions
In summary, a superior pre-crosslinked PMEU
elastomer was prepared
via in situ polymerizing PM onto polyurethane by means of a PDA layer
with an epoxy monomer as a pre-crosslinking agent, which improved
the crosslinking degree and interfacial activity of the PMEU elastomer.
The incorporated PMEU block elastomer served as a physical and chemical
crosslinker, which is able to form multiple interactions with the
SPI matrix to improve the crosslinking network and significantly enhance
the mechanical strength compared to pristine SPI-based films. Meanwhile,
the improvement in the microphase-separated structure of PMEU effectively
reduced the stress concentration and smoothed out energy upon deformation,
endowing SPMEU films with superior toughness. Compared to pristine
SPI films, the addition of the PMEU elastomer resulted in an increase
in TS, toughness, and WCA values of 146.7, 102.1, and 49.1%, respectively.
In addition, the PMEU elastomer was applied to the SPI-based adhesive
to further substantiate its superior performance, exhibiting particularly
high wet shear strength (1.35 MPa) compared to the pristine SPI-based
adhesive (0.62 MPa) with an increase of 117.7% to reach the industrial
application standard for plywood fabrication. The results indicate
that the proposed strategy is an effective and feasible approach to
construct a high-performance elastomer, which may show promise for
various biomass applications.

4.1 Materials
SPI with 95% protein content
was provided by Yuwang Ecological Food Industry Co., Ltd. Microfibrillated
cellulose (MFC; solid content of 1.5 wt %) aqueous dispersion was
acquired from Tianjin Haojia Reagents Co., Ltd., China, as-prepared
from homogenized wood pulp. Dopamine (97% purity), tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane,
poly(tetrahydrofuran) (Tris) (PTMG; Mn = 2000), 2,2-bis(hydroxymethyl) propionic acid (DMPA), tannic acid
(TA), and 1,6-hexanediol diglycidyl ether (HDE) were obtained from
Tianjin Heowns Biochem Co., Ltd. Butane diol (BD) was purchased from
Shanghai TCI Co., Ltd., and isophorone diisocyanate (IPDI) was obtained
from Aladdin Biochem Co., Ltd. PTMG, DMPA, TA, and BD were used after
being dried in a vacuum oven at 110 °C. Glycerol, triethylamine
(TEA), and other chemical reagents were purchased from Beijing Chemical
Reagents Co., Ltd (Beijing, China) and used without further purification.

4.2 Preparation of PMEU Pre-Crosslinked Block
Elastomer
The PMEU elastomer was prepared via the conventional
two-step method. In the first step, quantitative IPDI, PTMG, and DMPA
(6 wt % of total prepolymer weight), with a molar ratio of isocyanate
and hydroxy groups of 1.80, were introduced into a four-necked flask
outfitted with a thermometer, nitrogen inlet, condenser, and mechanical
stirrer and then heated for 3 h at 70–80 °C under nitrogen
protection with the addition of a few drops of the catalyst. Next,
a certain proportion of BD and TA (polyol molar ratio of BD/TA = 1:9;
the amount of hydroxyl groups in TA molecular metered to 3) was dissolved
in acetone and added dropwise as the −NCO/–OH ratio
approached 1.05 to avoid any sudden reaction.30 The mixture was mechanically stirred for 5 h at 70 °C; the
isocyanate (−NCO) content was continually tested during the
reacting time. After being cooled to room temperature, the required
TEA was used to neutralize −COOH groups and stirred for 45
min.

Next, the MFC (5 wt % of solution weight) was immersed
in a dopamine buffer solution to prepare a PM suspension as reported
in the references of our group.3 The prepolymer
was then dispersed in the prepared PM aqueous solution with an epoxy
monomer (3 wt % of the PM solution content) added and vigorously stirred
for shearing-emulsification. Finally, the pure waterborne polyurethane
PMEU was obtained after removing any remaining acetone through a rotary
steaming instrument. The PU/epoxy monomer (EU) and MFC/epoxy monomer/PU
(MEU) elastomer were prepared using a similar synthesis method, where
the EU contained no fillers and MEU was prepared with unmodified MFC
compared to the PMEU elastomer.

Composites
The SPMEU films were fabricated using a casting
method as shown in Scheme 1. SPI (5 g), deionized water (95 g), and glycerol (2.5 g)
were introduced into a beaker and stirred until a uniform mixture
was obtained. The pH value of the mixture was adjusted with the NaOH
solution (1.0 M) to 9.0 and then stirred continuously for 30 min in
a water bath at 85 °C. As listed in Table 4, a certain amount of PMEU elastomer was
added to the SPI film-forming solution as the mixture was stirred
thoroughly. Next, the obtained solution was poured into plates and
vacuum-dried for 24 h at 45 °C. The films were then placed into
desiccators containing saturated K2CO3 solution
(relative humidity of 50 ± 2%) before any further measurements.
SEU and SMEU films were fabricated by introducing a certain amount
of EU and MEU elastomers into the SPI solution as SPMEU was prepared
according to Table 4.

a The sample “M” represents the meaning of “mass”.

Samples of PMEU-reinforced
SPMEU resin were prepared using a simple
blending method. Briefly, SPI (15 g) was added into deionized water
(85 g) via mechanical stirring for 10 min at 20 °C. Then, the
required amount (Table 4) of elastomer was introduced and stirred uniformly at 20 °C.
Three-layer plywood samples were prepared at a spread rate of 180
g/m2 per side. The glued veneers were then hot-pressed
under 120 °C and 1.0 MPa for 315 s. The prepared plywood samples
were stored at ambient temperature for more than 12 h before further
testing. The control adhesive group was synthesized under the same
conditions without the addition of the polyurethane elastomer.

4.4 Characterization of PMEU Elastomer and SPMEU
Composites
Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra of the
SPMEU film, PMEU elastomer, and PM were detected by attenuated total
reflection (Nicolet 6700) ranging from 650 to 4000 cm–1 at a resolution of 4 cm–1 with 32 scans. X-ray
diffraction (XRD) results were obtained using a commercial X-ray D8
Advance diffractometer (Cu Kα, λ = 0.154 nm; Bruker AXS;
Karlsruhe, Germany) with a voltage of 40 kV at 40 mA ranging from
5 to 60° at a rate of 2°/min. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS; Thermo Fisher Scientific) was performed to analyze the elements
via a monochromatized Al Kα X-ray source of 148.6 eV at room
conditions. The thermal stability indicators of the SPI-based film,
PMEU elastomer, and PM were measured on a thermogravimetric (TG Q50;
TA Instruments) machine at a constant heating rate of 10 °C/min
in the range of 30–600 °C under nitrogen conditions. The
cross-sectional morphologies of the PM filler and SPI-based hybrid
films were examined using scanning electron microscopy (SEM; Hitachi
S-3400 N) with the accelerating voltage of 5 kV. The solid-state 13C NMR spectra of SPI-based films were obtained using an AVANCE
III 400WB spectrometer (Bruker, Switzerland) with a 4 mm cross-polarization/magic-angle
spinning probe at a spinning speed of 14 KHz; methane carbon atoms
of adamantane (29.47 ppm) were applied to correct the chemical shifts.

4.5 Mechanical Testing
The water-resistant
bonding strength of SPI-based adhesive plywood was measured according
to the type II plywood standard of China National Standard GB/T 9846.3-2004
as described by Li et al.52 The plywood
specimens were immersed in 63 °C water for 3 h and then tested
at a cross-head speed of 10 mm/min on a universal mechanical machine
(WDE-200E; Jinan, China). Wet shear strength was calculated as follows  Mechanical performance of SPMEU films was
tested on an INSTRON 3365 Universal Material Testing Machine (Norwood,
MA) with an initial gauge length of 50 mm and cross-head speed of
50 mm/min at room temperature. The final values of tensile strength
(TS) and elongation at break (EB) properties reported below are the
averages of at least six specimens.

Dynamic mechanical analyses
(DMA) of SPMEU films were conducted with the TA instrument Q800 with
the film tension mode. The samples were cut into 4 mm × 20 mm
shapes and tested at 1 Hz frequency in the range of 40–180
°C at a heating rate of 5 °C/min.

4.6 Water
Barrier Performance
The surface
hydrophilicity of films was measured with an OCA 20 water contact
angle device (WCA; Dataphysics Instruments Gmbh, Germany) at ambient
temperature. To further evaluate the water-resistant properties of
films, the total soluble matter (TSM) of specimens was measured according
to the following formula  where Wi and Wt denote
the initial dry film weight and dry
sample weight after dissolution.
