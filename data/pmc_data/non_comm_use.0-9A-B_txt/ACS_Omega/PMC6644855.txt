This research details the synthesis
and application of a novel
pectin–hydroxyapatite (PHAp) composite for fluoride (F–) adsorption from aqueous solutions. To determine the
efficiency of the adsorption process parameters, i.e., adsorbent dose
(0.1–0.4 g), initial fluoride concentration (10–30 mg/L),
and temperature (298–313 K), the Box–Behnken design
with three levels and three factors have been utilized. The quadratic
model was established on 27 batch runs by regression analysis of the
experimental data of these runs. The efficacy of adsorption was observed
using the Langmuir and Freundlich models. The adsorption rate was
found at 3.17 mg g−1min–1, and
adsorption kinetics followed pseudo-second order (PSO) for PHAp. The
significant novelty of this work is the synthesis of unique cubical-shaped
rods biopolymer composite from hydroxyapatite. Additionally, this
composite showed high adsorption capacity for F– compared to other hydroxyapatite adsorbents, and the improved adsorption
capacity is attributed to its unique shape which provides a larger
surface area. It can be reused for up to six cycles, which makes this
method environment-friendly. The economic viability of the synthesized
PHAp composite, in comparison to other adsorbents, is evident from
the cost–benefit analysis.

1 Introduction
The
fluoride (F–), released from industrial effluents,
contaminates groundwater. This is of great concern as a high intake
of F– is detrimental to human health, causing skeletal
and dental fluorosis and neurological damages. Periodic weathering
of rocks and minerals add F– into groundwater. The
waste released from the glass and ceramic industries, electroplating,
coal-fired power stations, and so on are other sources that increase
the F– level in groundwater. These effluents can
increase the F– level up to 10–1000 mg/L.
The excess F– uptake through drinking water has
an adverse effect on the health of several million people, primarily
in developing countries. Although F– at low doses
protects teeth from degradation, exposure to higher concentrations
of fluoride can cause dental fluorosis. The beneficial dose and harmful
levels are comparatively closer; the testified ideal value to avoid
tooth decay is 0.5 mg/L, i.e., below the permissible limit of 1.5
mg/L suggested by the WHO. Hydroxyapatite (Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2, HAp), the key constituent of
bones and teeth, is responsible for both detrimental and therapeutic
health effects of fluoride. Due to the F– uptake
nature of HAp, it has been used in water treatment.1−8

Therefore, it is necessary to design a highly selective and
rapid
method for elimination of F–. The conventional methods
of F– removal are reverse osmosis,9 nanofiltration,10 ion exchange,11,12 and adsorption.13 Among these methods,
adsorption is favorable due to its economic feasibility. Adsorption
is suitable for removing contaminants in trace level and has become
increasingly popular in water treatment applications owing to its
simplicity, cost-effectiveness, efficiency, easy operation, and lower
waste generation.

Recently, various low-cost adsorbents (i.e.,
activated alumina,14 carbon nanotubes,15 bone char,16 fly
ash,17 metal oxide,13 etc.) have been
used for F– removal. The traditional adsorbents
have limited application due to their low adsorption capacity; hence,
research is vital to produce new and effective materials for F– removal. Of late, biosorption technique (an eco-friendly
technique) has been predominantly used. Hydroxyapatite (HAp, Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2), the main essential
mineral of vertebrate skeletal systems, is efficient as an adsorbent
for removal of F–. HAp is a biomineral that is used
in water treatment due to its eco-friendly nature, easy availability,
low cost, and presence of excess exchangeable hydroxyl groups. However,
their brittleness limits the application of HAp. Additionally, due
to excess pressure drop during field application, its powder cannot
be utilized in fixed-bed column directly. To overcome these technological
issues, polymeric composites have been studied. Biopolymer-supported
inorganic composites and their synthesis are in limelight these days
due to their exceptional structure and properties.18−20 Furthermore,
the synergistic effect involved in these composites will provide additional
mechanical strength to the composite.

Pectin is a type of bio-renewable,
nontoxic, inexpensive, and biodegradable
natural plant ionic polysaccharides, mainly composed of α-(1→4)-linked d-galacturonic acid.21,22 These are biocompatible,
biofunctional, nontoxic, nonimmunogenic, and biodegradable. Advanced
studies mainly focus on biopolymer composites of HAp due to its high
surface area and reactivity. In this study, a novel synthesis of pectin–hydroxyapatite
(PHAp) composite with the utilization of new biopolymer in F– adsorption studies is discussed. Additionally, the unique feature
of this composite is its shape, which enhances the adsorption sites
as well surface area (157 m2/g), and hence the adsorption
capacity (28.47 mg/g). Although to the best of the author’s
knowledge, there is no work reported on differently shaped adsorbents
for F– removal studies by using biopolymer composite
adsorbent, Prabhu et al. reported dendrimer-like hyperbranched chitosan
composite for F– removal having an adsorption capacity
of 17.44 mg/g.23

The collection of
statistical and mathematical techniques, which
is called response surface methodology (RSM), was used for empirical
model building to overcome the limitations of traditional methods.
It is most convenient, particularly in adsorption or removal process,24 for modeling mechanism parameters. The specific
utilization of RSM is to dictate the most advantageous operational
conditions for a specific system or to check a region that satisfies
the operational specifications.25,26 The successful synthesis
of PHAp adsorbent has been done and it was characterized by Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET), field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), energy-dispersive
X-ray analysis (EDAX), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Fourier
transform infrared (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and thermogravimetric
analysis (TGA) studies. Additionally, the effect of temperature, adsorbent
dosage, initial concentration, and other factors on F– removal by Pec–HAp composite was inspected by using the Box–Behnken
design (BBD) in RSM. Langmuir and Freundlich’s models were
applied to study the adsorption mechanism, and pseudo-first-order
(PFO) and pseudo-second-order (PSO) models were utilized to examine
the kinetics of the adsorption process. The thermodynamic analysis
was used to study the adsorption process feasibility, spontaneity,
and nature.

The novelty of this research is the preparation
of PHAp composite
of unique shape (cubical rod shape), which has a high adsorption capacity
due to the availability of six planes for the adsorption compared
to other planar adsorbents, which provide only a single planar surface
(Figure S1).

2 Discussion
of Experimental Outcomes
2.1 Characterization
2.1.1 FESEM and EDAX Mapping
Figure 1 shows the FESEM
images of pectin (a, b), PHAp-F (c, d), and PHAp (e–h). The
FESEM images clearly show the cubical rod shape of PHAp at different
angles at 1–5 μm scale. Figure 1e shows the upper morphology of vertically
standing rods, Figure 1f (5 μm) shows the agglomerated form of rods, and Figure 1g (5 μm) shows
dispersed rod shape, which shows the dissimilar length of rods. After
F– adsorption, the shape of the composite was destroyed,
due to the accumulation of spherical shaped F– on
the rods, which is clearly shown in Figure 1c,d. The pectin shows the irregular shape
of the polymer. Moreover, Figure 2 shows the EDAX spectrum of synthesized PHAp (Figure 2d), demonstrating
the existence of C, O, Ca, and P elements, while in PHAp-F (Figure 2e), one sharp peak
of the extra element appears in the EDAX spectrum. The EDAX spectrum
of pectin shows only two peaks of C and O (Figure 2a), which shows the purity of the polymer
as well as the synthesized compound.

PHAp-F, and (e–h)
PHAp at different views of cubical rods.

Figure 2 (a, b, d) EDX images of pectin, PHAp, and PHAp-F and (c, e) mapping
images of PHAp and PHAp-F.

Including the EDAX spectrum of the composite before and after
F– adsorption, EDAX mapping images further supported
the elemental composition of pectin, PHAp, and PHAp-F (Figure 2b,c,f, respectively).

2.1.2 BET
Figure 3A shows the N2 adsorption–desorption
isotherms of type IV, and the corresponding pore size distributions
are shown in Figure 3A1 of PHAp. The hysteresis loop (type IV) indicated the presence
of both micropores and mesopores in the composite. The distributions
of the pore volume, pore size, and the surface area before and after
F– adsorption on PHAp are tabulated in Table S1. The BET surface area and the pore volume
of PHAp and PHAp-F were found to be 157, 100.0 m2/g and
0.122, 0.981 cc/g, respectively, which were higher than the values
reported in the literature.27,28

2.1.3 XPS Analysis
XPS was utilized to
identify the various chemical species present on the adsorbent surface
before and after the F– adsorption on PHAp. The
high-resolution C 1s spectra (Figure 4A,B) were deconvoluted into four distinct peaks that
correspond to the sp2–C, sp3–C,
C–OH, and C=O bonds at 284.26, 284.50, 285.74, and 288.61
eV.

Figure 4 XPS scan of (A, B) carbon and (C, D) oxygen before and after F– adsorption, respectively.

Oxygen deconvolution spectra (O 1s) for PHAp shows three
important
contributions at 531.23, 529.37, and 528.83 eV (see Figure 4C,D). These signals can be
associated with the oxygen interaction from chemisorbed water, calcium,
and phosphorus in the PHAp composite. The intensities of the three
signals are found to change after the interaction of F– with PHAp owing to surface modification, and these changes were
observed at ∼528.56, 530.21, and 531.08 eV (Figure 4C,D). The decreased signal
intensity was observed at 531.23 and 531.08 eV, which may be due to
the interactions between the PHAp and F– ion. After
F– adsorption, interactions of Ca with F–, i.e., binding energy of 347.88–351.49 eV, were observed,
which also supported the presence of calcium on the surface of the
adsorbent. After interaction with F–, their binding
energy shifted to 348.07 and 351.63 eV (see Figure 5A,B). The P 2p XPS image exhibits two peaks
at 132.9 eV assigned to P–C and P–N bonds, and the other
peak at 133.26 eV corresponding to the P–O bonds of PHAp29 in Figure 5C,D. The binding energies of all elements before and
after F– adsorption are tabulated in Table S2.

Figure 5 XPS scan of (A, B) calcium and (C, D)
phosphorous before and after
F– adsorption, respectively, and (E) F–.

Finally, F 1s XPS images of F–-loaded PHAp are
reported in Figure 5E, which contain two signals at 684.51 and 683.50 eV. The peak at
684.51 eV is an evidence of the surface reaction between F– and Ca2+, which implies the electrostatic interaction
mechanism of adsorption. The second peak at 683.50 eV may be due to
the replacement of −OH group of PHAp. The above results indicate
the important role of hydroxyl groups in F– adsorption,
implying the ion-exchange mechanism of F– adsorption.

2.1.4 FTIR Spectroscopy
Strong absorption
bands appearing at 1024 and 621 cm–1 showed the
stretching and bending vibrations of PO43– of PHAp (Figure 3B). The absorption band at 1024 cm–1 was broad and appeared due to the overlap of C–O–C
stretching of pectin and PO43– stretching of PHAp. The absorption
bands occurring at 1613 and 2935 cm–1 were attributed
to the stretching vibrations of C–O and C–H groups,
respectively. There are two broad bands observed between 2500 and
3550 cm–1. The broad band found in the region from
2500 to 3300 cm–1 is due to the stretching of O–H
bond in the acid group, and another broad band appearing in the region
from 3200 to 3550 cm–1 is attributed to the stretching
of O–H band in alcohol group. The intensity of the broad band,
appearing from 2500 to 3500 cm–1, of −OH
bond in the acid group was decreased in the F–-adsorbed
PHAp composite due to the exchange of the −OH group present
in the composite by F–. The extra peak at 465 cm–1 is attributed to the F– peak.30,31

2.1.5 XRD
From Figure 6A, the crystalline peaks of HAp appearing
at 2θ (25.92, 32, 33, 35, and 39.81°) were found in the
PHAp composite, which showed that no obvious changes were found in
the peak structure after the formation of composite and confirmed
that the crystal structure of n-HAp was intact in PHAp composite.32

Figure 6 (A) XRD pattern and (B) TGA curve of PHAp.

2.1.6 TGA
The TGA
curve of the PHAp (Huo
et al.) exhibits the loss of mass in three steps. The first step,
in general, is attributed to a weight loss of about 1.25 mg (10%)
in the temperature range of 25–200 °C, which may be due
to release of water within this temperature range, while the second
degradation step, with 4% weight loss in the temperature range of
200–400 °C, was found to be due to the removal of −OH
groups. The third degradation step contributed to a weight loss of
1.25 mg (10%) in the temperature range of 400–800 °C assigned
by weak endothermic peaks could be related to some phase transformations33,34 in structures (Figure 6B).

2.2 Development of Regression
Model Equation for
RSM
The RSM methodology of statics was utilized to construct
a relation between the %A of F– and its depending parameters, i.e., three independent variables
(adsorbent dose, Ci, and temperature),
which directly affect the adsorption. The relation between independent
variables and %A is in the form of a second-order
polynomial equation. The polynomial equation, in the quadratic form,
is designed on the analysis of coded or actual factor for %A of F–, and the equation obtained is
shown in eq 1 1  The positive
or negative term defines the
synergistic or antagonistic effect of the term, respectively. Analysis
of variance (ANOVA) results of F– adsorption by
PHAp are tabulated in Table 1. ANOVA was utilized to study the accuracy of the generated
model, as well as to examine the fitness of the model and the main
and interaction constants of the polynomial equation. The F value of the designed model was found to be 29.97, with
lower probability (<0.0001) indicating that the model was significant.

Table 1 Response Surface Regression: %A vs
Temperature, Adsorbent Dose, and Initial F– Concentration
parameters	coefficient	seq. SS	F	p	
A	5.43	532.68	610.28	0.00	
B	6.47	713.54	817.48	0.00	
C	–1.98	70.84	81.16	0.00	
AA	–1.28	9.92	11.36	0.007	
BB	–2.65	42.26	48.41	0.00	
CC	0.88	0.09	0.10	0.082	
AB	–2.96	105.49	120.86	0.00

BC	1.61	35.16	40.28	0.00	
constant	88.39	 	 	 	
From the polynomial eq 1, it can be concluded that
of the three variables, B(Ci), initial F– concentration
had the major effect on the %A of F–, due to the maximum F value. Variable A, i.e., adsorbent dose, is followed by B, again
according to the F value. p >
0.05
is not significant for the designed model. In adsorption studies,
all linear terms are significant, i.e., A, B, C (adsorbent dose, Ci, temperature), and quadratic terms (AA, BB) are significant, whereas only AB and BC are significant for the interaction terms.
Other variables such as CC and AC do not have a significant effect on the F– adsorption
due to the p-value which is >0.05.31,35−37

2.2.1 Effects of Variables
on F– Adsorption
To understand the interaction
between independent
variables and their results, three-dimensional response surface plots
(RSP) and two-dimensional counter plots of the designed model were
constructed by utilizing the MINITAB 16.0 software (Figures 7–9 and S2). The
RSP envision the interaction effects of each independent variable,
which influence the %A of F–. The
shape of the contour plot shows the nature and extent of the interactions
effects among the experimental factors on the %A.38 In each plot, the interacting variables were
changed within the experimental assortments, while the third variable
was constant or at the highest level.

Figure 7 Cube plot for %A.

Figure 8 Contour and surface plots of interaction between Ci and adsorbent dose.

Figure 9 Contour and surface plots of interaction between adsorbent dose
and temperature.

2.2.2 Effect
of Adsorbent Dose, Ci, and Temperature
Figures 7–9 show the
collective effect of two factors alternatively, i.e., adsorbent dose
and Ci, adsorbent dose and temperature, Ci and temperature, etc. The cube plot in Figure 7 shows all three
factors together in the form of their %A values with
all three levels. Adsorbent dose and Ci both show a positive effect, and temperature shows a negative effect
on %A of F–, i.e., with an increase
in adsorbent dose and Ci, %A increases, while with an increase in temperature, %A decreases (Figure 9). In case of adsorbent dose and Ci,
%A increases because at a higher adsorbent dose,
there is a number of active sites and with high Ci, there is a number of F– ions for
adsorption. Hence, with the increase in the adsorbent dose (0.4 g)
and Ci, the adsorption will be comparatively
higher.39

In case of adsorbent dose
and temperature (Figure 9), it was concluded that F– adsorption decreases
with increase in temperature and increases with increasing absorbent
dose. This observation might be due to the fact that at constant Ci, an increase in adsorbent dose increases both
surface area and the availability of active sites on PHAp molecules,
which leads to enhanced F– adsorption. In case of
temperature and Ci (Figure S2) on the F– adsorption onto PHAp
at adsorbent dose 0.4 g, F– adsorption increases
with increase in Ci because when the Ci increases, the active sites of the adsorbent
will be surrounded by a greater number of F–. The
increase in %A is very little with increasing temperature.
This may be due to the increased number of binding sites with increasing
temperature and hence the augmenting adsorption.

2.3 Adsorption Property
2.3.1 Effect of Initial pH
In the adsorption
process, pH of the solution plays a significant role: it controls
the adsorption of F– on the PHAp at the adsorbent
interface. The pH effect was studied at a Ci of 10 mg/L, and pH ranges from 3 to 11 (Figure 10A). Percent adsorption of F– increases up to 7.0 (9.5 mg/g) and then decreases from 7 to 11 (8.6
mg/L). This change can be explained by the surface charge of PHAp
in both alkaline and acidic mediums. It is well known that in acidic
medium, i.e., pH < 7, the adsorbent surface is highly protonated
and hence maximum F– is adsorbed in acidic medium,
due to opposite charges of adsorbent and F–, and
the opposite is true for alkaline media40 (pH > 7).

Figure 10 (A) Effect of pH and (B) co-ions on F– adsorption.

2.3.2 Effect
of Co-ions
The effect of
co-ions on qe of PHAp was analyzed by
comparing the fluoride qe with co-ions
and without co-ions, for which initially fixed concentration of fluoride
solution was analyzed by fluoride meter and then a similar concentration
of co-anion, such as SO42–, with the fluoride solution was analyzed. Similarly,
other co-anions, viz., Cl, NO3–, and HCO3– were also analyzed with fluoride
solution. Analysis (Figure 10B) results shows the decrease in qe with co-anions because they compete with each other for the active
sites on the adsorbent surface. The competition of anions for the
active sites is closely related to the charge/radius (Z/r) ratio, ionic radii, and their concentration.
The order of Z/r values is as follows:
Cl– (1/0.181 nm) < NO3– (1/0.179 nm) < SO42– (2/0.230
nm). Ions with high Z/r values have
high affinity with adsorbent and hence the multivalent anions with
smaller radii have greater affinity than the monovalent anions. Therefore,
SO42– competes more and reduces qe greater
than the monovalent (NO3– and Cl–) anions. But this trend
is not applicable in the case of OH– and HCO3–, and the
effect of these two anions may be regulated by the ionic radii. Due
to almost similar ionic radii of HCO3– (0.157 nm) ion with F– (0.133 nm) ion, it competes with fluoride strongly and decreases qe more than other ions. The decrease in qe is also due to the increase in solution pH
in the presence of HCO3–.41−43 The F– ion fits better into the crystal structure
of apatite due to its smaller ionic radii and it can substitute OH– in HAp and form the more thermodynamically stable
fluorapatite (Ca10(PO4)6F2). Therefore, the order of %A in the presence of
coexisting anions is Cl– < NO3– < SO42– < HCO3–. However, qe of the PHAp adsorbent is much lower in the
presence of HCO3– ion, i.e., 96.25%, owing to its greater interaction with an adsorbent,
which reduces the active sites for F– adsorption.

2.4 Adsorption Isotherms
To compute qe of PHAp for F– adsorption,
Langmuir (Figure 11A)44 and Freundlich (Figure 11B)45 isotherms have been studied at four different temperatures (298,
303, 308, and 313 K) Table 2. Langmuir isotherm model illustrated the monolayer adsorption
on the homogeneous surface. Langmuir parameters are related to the
maximum adsorption capacity (qm), and
binding affinity of adsorbate to the adsorbent (KL). A high qe of 28.57 mg/g
at 298 K accounts for good adsorption behavior of PHAp compared to
other biopolymer composites of HAp for F–, as shown
in Table 3. A dimensionless
separation factor RL describes the feasibility
of the adsorption. The value of RL <
1 (Table 2) signifies
the effectual interaction between PHAp and F–.

The Freundlich isotherm illustrates the multilayer
adsorption of
heterogeneous systems and assumes that different sites have several
adsorption energies involved. KF and 1/n represent the qe and intensity
of the adsorbent, respectively, in Table 2. It was found that the data fitted with
the Langmuir isotherm model, with the highest R2 value of 0.96.

2.5 Adsorption Kinetics
The effect of
contact time is a significant factor for the adsorption studies, i.e.,
kinetic studies. Figure S3 shows the effect
of a change in time on F– adsorption process. It
was experientially found that with increase in time, the F– adsorption increases gradually and reaches up to an equilibrium
position after 30 min. Consequently, the contact time for F– adsorption process was considered as 30 min. To understand the kinetics
of the adsorption process, PFO and PSO kinetic models were utilized
to correlate the solid–liquid adsorption. Figure 11C,D shows the kinetics of
the adsorption process, and the PSO model is the best fit according
to the R2 analysis. These results predicted
that the adsorption mechanism of PSO was predominant and that the
physisorption process48,49 controlled the adsorption because k2 value decreases with increase in temperature,
as shown in Table 4.

The activation energy (Ea), defined
as the minimum amount of K.E. required for the adsorption to occur,
gives an assessed energy barrier that the adsorbate must have to overcome
for adsorption to occur. The Ea can be
calculated by fitting the kinetic constant of the PSO model by Arrhenius
equation at different temperatures50 (eq 2). 2  The Ea value was
found to be 32.6 kJ/mol (Figure 12B), the value of Ea decides
the type of adsorption, and the result of Ea suggesting the adsorption of F– is related to
particle diffusion controlled in this case.51

constant, (C) van’t Hoff plot, and (D) activation energy by
sticking probability.

2.6 Thermodynamic Study
The adsorption
process was much influenced by temperature. To examine the spontaneity,
feasibility, and nature of the adsorption process, the thermodynamic
data plays an important role, which can be obtained from eqs 3 to 5. 3   4   5  As shown in Figure 12, the values of ΔH and ΔS have obtained parameters of the curve
ln KC versus 1/T (Figure 12C), i.e.,
from the slope and intercept, respectively. From Table S3, the positive value of ΔH and
the negative value of ΔG confirmed the endothermic
nature of the adsorption process and the feasibility and spontaneous
nature of adsorption, respectively. The positive value of ΔS showed an increase in randomness during the adsorption
of F– at the solid–solution interface.52

A new concept of sticking probability
(S*) was explained using modified Arrhenius eqs 6 and 7. S* is related to the surface coverage (θ).
This is a measure of the potential of an adsorbent to hold the adsorbate
on its surface.53 6   7  Figure 12D shows
the graph of surface coverage and 1/T, and the intercept
and slope of the graph give ln S* and Ea/R, respectively. The value S* decides the nature
of adsorption. The reported value of S* reveals the
physisorption nature of adsorption (Table S4).

2.7 Reusability Studies
The regeneration
of PHAp is a significant aspect to utilize adsorbent in practical
application (Figure 12A). Table S5 shows the analysis data of
repeated %A of adsorption–desorption cycles.
After every cycle, the filtered adsorbent was washed with 0.01 M HCl/NaOH
and then used for the next cycle. This repeated process was done for
six cycles, and after six cycles, the %A was observed
to be decreasing, probably due to the replacement of −OH group
by F– ions. Nevertheless, the regeneration efficacy
of the PHAp could be improved by treating the used adsorbent with
NaOH/HCl.

2.8 Cost–Benefit Analysis
The
cost–benefit analysis for the adsorbent is an important factor
for its economic viability. The developed PHAp composite was synthesized
by utilizing AR-grade chemicals. The cost–benefit analysis
confirmed that the F– removal cost by PHAp is reasonably
good compared to other traditional adsorbents. The cost of PHAp is
higher than some traditional adsorbents,54−58 as shown in Table 5; however, PHAp had a high adsorption capacity of 28.57
mg/g, which even remained higher (60%) after six successive adsorption
cycles. Hence, the synthesized PHAp composite shows good F– removal efficacy in water.

hydrous ferric oxide	13.2	10.42

2.9 Adsorption Mechanism of F– on PHAp
Thermodynamic studies, spectroscopic investigation,
adsorption studies, and kinetic studies all illustrate that the mechanism
of adsorption of F– on PHAp is mainly due to ion
exchange, electrostatic interaction, and also by physio-type adsorption
(Figure 13). From
the XPS and FTIR investigations, the adsorbent has replaceable OH
group, which participates in the ion-exchange mechanism. This is also
proved by pH studies. At lower pH, the adsorbent surface acquires
a positive charge, and hence it electrostatically interacts with negatively
charged F–, while at high pH, the opposite phenomenon
works, i.e., adsorbent acquires a negative charge. Additionally, the
Ca2+ ions present in PHAp interact with F– ions by electrostatic attraction.

Figure 13 Expected mechanism of F– adsorption.

3 Conclusions
In this work, PHAp composite, an effective adsorbent for F– adsorption, was synthesized by a simple precipitation
method, which produces a cubical-shaped rod-type structure. The PHAp
composite was established by several characterizing techniques: BET,
FESEM, EDAX, XPS, FTIR, XRD, and TGA. The RSM was combined by BBD
to regulate the effect of three factors, i.e., adsorbent dosage, Ci, and temperature, on F– adsorption.
The adsorption process follows PSO kinetics and follows Langmuir type
of adsorption, i.e., monolayer adsorption. The qm for the PHAp adsorption process was found to be 28.57 mg/g.
Thermodynamically, the process was feasible, spontaneous, and endothermic
in nature, as revealed by the thermodynamic parameters, i.e., ΔG, ΔS, and ΔH. The overall study indicated that PHAp composite can be used as
an efficient adsorbent for F– removal from drinking
water and other water sources.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials
Chemical reagents predominantly
involved pectin, Ca(NO)3·4H2O, NH3, NaOH, HCl, NaNO3, NaNO3, NaCl, NaF, (NH4)2PO4, etc. All chemicals were of analytical
grade and utilized without further purification. Deionized (DI) water
was utilized during the preparation of adsorbent and adsorption experiments.

4.2 Preparation of PHAp Adsorbent
Pectin
(2 g) was dissolved in 100 mL of DI water at room temperature, and
the mixture was continuously stirred to obtain a homogeneous solution.
Then, 20 mL of 1 M (NH4)3PO4 solution
was added dropwise into the polymer solution within 15 min. The pH
of the solution was maintained up to 10 using 25% NH3 solution.
Then, 20 mL of 1.67 M calcium nitrate solution was added to the above
solution for 30 min and stirred vigorously for 1 h, after which the
solution was left for 24 h at RT. Then, the solution was filtered
and washed with DI water to remove some impurities, and the precipitate
obtained was PHAp. The precipitate was dried at 100 °C for 6
h and then crushed into a fine powder. The expected arrangement of
HAp in pectin polymer is represented in Figure 14. PHAp was also synthesized by varying pH,
ripening time, and concentration of calcium ions (Table S6), which are shown in Figure S4. The fine powder obtained was PHAp, which was further utilized for
adsorption experiments.

4.3 General
Characterization
The N2 adsorption–desorption
isotherms, surface area, and
pore size distribution of PHAp before and after F– adsorption were calculated by using BET analysis. Before the analysis,
the samples were kept in vacuum at 300 °C for 4 h for outgassing
to remove the volatile gases. To study the surface morphology and
element detection, field emission scanning electron microscopy and
EDAX analysis were carried out. The binding energy and surface composition
of PHAp in both stages were analyzed by XPS analysis. Furthermore,
to confirm the functional groups involved in the mechanism and the
composition of the adsorbent, FTIR analysis was done using Bruker-FTIR.
And to define the crystallography of the structure, XRD analysis was
conducted. TGA analysis also was done to know about the thermal behavior
of the PHAp using PerkinElmer TGA-4000.

4.4 Statistical
Analysis of Adsorption Process
The RSM design was utilized
to examine the F– adsorption on the PHAp. Statistical
design for RSM comprises three
levels (−1, 0, and +1). The RSM design methods were carried
out with three independent variables (adsorbent dose, initial fluoride
concentration (Ci), and temperature (Table 6)). Table 7 shows the data obtained from
the software after 27 runs per experimental design. Equation 8 demonstrates the effect of
variables in terms of linear and quadratic interactions. Then, the
statistical calculation was done by using regression coefficients
to generate dimensional and contour maps from the regression models. Figure 15 shows the details
(step by step) for optimizing F– adsorption. Minitab
software was utilized for the analysis of the experimental data.

The following second-order polynomial equation was
utilized to
analyze the experimental outcomes of adsorption 8  where Y is the predicted
response (%A) and βo, βi, βij, βii, and Xi, Xj are the offset term, linear effect, first-order
interaction, quadratic effect, and independent variables constants
of the model, respectively. ANOVA was applied to study the adsorption
behavior, i.e., %A, and independent variable effects
(interaction effect), to find the optimum level, and to assess the
statistical parameters by means of RSM.

4.5 Adsorption
Experiments
All adsorption
tests were carried out with Ci in the
range of 5–100 mg/L, adsorbent dose of 0.1–0.4 g, contact
time of 5–45 min, pH of 3–11, temperature of 298–313
K, assorted ion effect (Cl–, NO3–, SO42–, and HCO3–), and regeneration
studies for F– adsorption onto PHAp. The pH value
of the solution was regulated by using 0.1 mol/L HCl or NaOH. The
adsorption kinetics of F– on the adsorbent was studied
at four different temperatures (298, 303, 308, and 313 K) and a particular
time interval (5–30 min) with the adsorbent dose of 0.4 g/L, Ci of 10 mg/L, and pH of 7.0. The adsorption
isotherm trials were examined by altering the Ci from 10 to 100 mg/L at 298, 303, 308, and 313 K. All other
conditions are the same as in kinetic studies. The residual F– concentration after each adsorption experiment was
analyzed by F– equipped ion meter and calculated
using eqs 9 and 10. 9   10  where %A and qe are
% adsorption and adsorption capacity, respectively.
