l-Threonine is an important supplement
in the food industry. It is currently produced through fermentation
of Escherichia coli but requires additional
purification steps to remove E. coli endotoxin. To avoid these steps, it is desirable to use Corynebacterium glutamicum, a microorganism generally
regarded as safe. Engineering of C. glutamicum to increase production of l-threonine has mainly focused
on gene regulation as well as l-threonine export or carbon
flux depletion. In this study, we focus on the negative feedback inhibition
produced by l-threonine on the enzyme homoserine kinase (ThrB).
Although l-threonine binds to allosteric sites of aspartate
kinase (LysC) and homoserine dehydrogenase (Hom), serving as a noncompetitive
inhibitor, it acts as a competitive inhibitor on ThrB. This is problematic
when attempting to engineer enzymes that are nonresponsive to increasing
cellular concentrations of l-threonine. Using primary structure
alignment as well as analysis of the Methanocaldococcus
jannaschii ThrB (MjaThrB) active
site in complex with l-threonine (inhibitor of ThrB) and l-homoserine (substrate of ThrB), a conserved active-site alanine
residue (A20) in C. glutamicum ThrB
(CglThrB) was predicted to be important for differential
interactions with l-threonine and l-homoserine.
Through site-directed mutagenesis, we show that one variant of C. glutamicum ThrB, CglThrB-A20G,
retains wild-type enzymatic activity, with dramatically decreased
feedback inhibition by l-threonine. Additionally, by solving
the first Corynebacterium X-ray crystal
structure of homoserine kinase, we can confirm that the changes in l-threonine affinity to the CglThrB-A20G active
site derive from loss of van der Waals interactions.

==== Body
Introduction
l-Threonine is an essential amino
acid for mammals and
has a wide spectrum of commercial uses, such as a food additive and
agricultural feed supplement. Mainly produced through microbial fermentation
of Escherichia coli, considerable efforts
have been directed toward more efficient production of l-threonine
via metabolic engineering.1 From l-aspartate, the biosynthesis of l-threonine comprises five
successive reactions sequentially catalyzed in Corynebacterium
glutamicum by aspartate kinase (LysC), aspartyl semialdehyde
dehydrogenase (Asd), homoserine dehydrogenase (Hom), homoserine kinase
(ThrB), and threonine synthase (ThrC) (Figure 1).

Figure 1 Biosynthetic pathway of l-threonine
and its regulation
in C. glutamicum. l-Threonine
regulates its own biosynthetic pathway by allosterically inhibiting
aspartate kinase (LysC) and homoserine dehydrogenase (Hom) in a noncompetitive
manner and homoserine kinase (ThrB) as a competitive inhibitor (shown
in broken lines). Solid lines indicate branch pathways related to
the l-threonine biosynthetic pathway.

The level of l-threonine production in C. glutamicum is tightly regulated in four different
ways (Figure 1). First,
available carbon flux is routed from l-threonine biosynthesis
mainly toward the competing l-lysine and l-methionine
metabolic pathways.2 Second, intracellular l-threonine is depleted through the production of l-isoleucine and glycine.3−6 Third, both the hom and thrB genes in C. glutamicum are clustered in a single operon that is repressed by l-methionine, possibly by a transcriptional attenuation-like regulation
mechanism.7,8 Finally, three enzymes in the biosynthetic
pathway of l-threonine are regulated by feedback inhibition:
homoserine dehydrogenase (Hom) is subject to feedback inhibition by l-threonine and aspartate kinase (LysC) by both l-lysine
and l-threonine. These two enzymes are inhibited by l-threonine in an allosteric noncompetitive manner, whereas homoserine
kinase (ThrB) is inhibited by l-threonine in a competitive
inhibitory mechanism.9−11

To afford higher levels of l-threonine
production, several
metabolic engineering strategies have been implemented. First, overexpression
of the homr-thrB operon that includes a feedback-resistant homoserine dehydrogenase
allele is a strategy that has been one of the most successful ones
to redirect the carbon flux from the l-lysine branch into
the l-threonine branch, leading to the accumulation of both l-threonine and l-homoserine.12,13 The second strategy has been to reduce l-threonine depletion
toward l-isoleucine and glycine by mutation of both glyA and ilvA responsible for the conversion
of l-threonine into glycine and l-isoleucine, respectively.14 Another strategy was to enhance the efflux of l-threonine, which typically accumulates in the cell and thus
downregulates the biosynthetic enzymes in a feedback manner.4,15 Both the introduction of a recombinant plasmid containing the permease thrE gene and the overexpression of the E.
coli genes rhtA, rhtC, and yeaS, previously inserted into C. glutamicum, lead to an increased production of l-threonine and a decrease in accumulation of l-lysine,
glycine, l-isoleucine, and l-homoserine.4,15−17

As described above, there are three enzymes
(LysC, Hom, and ThrB)
in the l-threonine biosynthetic pathway that are feedback
inhibited by the end-product l-threonine (Figure 1). Among these, feedback-resistant
mutations were successfully made in genes encoding for LysC and Hom
and overexpression of these mutant alleles resulted in a 3.5-fold
higher production of l-threonine in C. glutamicum.12,13 However, it has been difficult to produce
feedback-resistant homoserine kinase because l-threonine
inhibits the enzyme in a competitive manner with the substrate l-homoserine.11 Therefore, mutations
that block the binding of l-threonine at the active site
would also inhibit the binding of l-homoserine and thus severely
diminish the enzymatic activity of the enzyme.

In this report,
an attempt was made to render the active site of C.
glutamicum ThrB (CglThrB) more
selective toward l-homoserine than l-threonine.
First, we successfully crystallized CglThrB-WT with
a resolution of 2.2 Å. Aligning this structure with the archaea Methanocaldococcus jannaschii ThrB (MjaThrB) X-ray crystal structure that was solved with both homoserine
and threonine, we hypothesized that alanine 12 in MjaThrB (A20 in CglThrB) may support the binding of l-threonine and that the alteration of the residue might affect
the binding of l-threonine without affecting that of l-homoserine. To test this possibility, we mutated A20 in CglThrB to various amino acid residues; we tested the enzymatic
activity of these variants. The C. glutamicum ThrB-A20G (CglThrB-A20G) showed a similar activity
as wild-type ThrB (CglThrB-WT), whereas other mutations
abolished or greatly diminished the activity. Subsequent inhibition
assays showed that CglThrB-A20G was less inhibited
by l-threonine compared with CglThrB-WT.
Taken together, we have successfully released competitive feedback
inhibition of CglThrB without losing much of the
enzymatic activity via structural analysis and site-specific mutation.

Results
Identification
and Role of the Conserved ThrB Active-Site Residues
The enzymes
of the galactokinase, homoserine kinase, mevalonate
kinase, and phosphomevalonate kinase (GHMP) family possess three conserved
structural motifs, motif I, II, and III
(Figure 2).18 Two additional motifs are known to be important
for the binding amino acid substrate or inhibitor in ThrB, the lower
and upper lips.19,20 Of these motifs, motif I is the
only motif directly interacting with the side chains of the l-homoserine substrate or l-threonine inhibitor, thereby
allowing potential discrimination between the branched inhibitor, l-threonine, and the linear substrate, l-homoserine.
To determine the exact position of that conserved motif in C. glutamicum ThrB, we performed a pairwise protein
sequence alignment using the ThrB sequences encoded by E. coli and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Because X-ray crystal structures of the M. jannaschii-encoded ThrB in complex with l-threonine and l-homoserine have been solved (PDB codes: 1H73 and 1H72, respectively), the M.
jannaschii ThrB sequence was also used in the alignment
(Figure 2).19 A conserved amino acid sequence, −SSAN–,
in motif I was identified in this alignment.

kinase (CglThrB) sequence with those of E. coli, M. jannaschii, and M. tuberculosis using CLUSTAL

based on the structure of M. jannaschii ThrB, with these compounds bound in the active site.

A full-length structure of CglThrB-WT was solved
at 2.2 Å resolution. Aligning that structure with the X-ray crystal
structure of M. jannaschii in complex
with l-threonine and l-homoserine (Figure 3B,C, respectively), it was
confirmed that the active sites of the two proteins were structurally
similar and that the alanine (A12) of that motif was the only residue
directly interacting with the side-chain methyl moiety of l-threonine. Thus, the conserved alanine residue (A20) in motif I
of C. glutamicum ThrB offered the highest
potential for producing ThrB variants exhibiting enhanced selectivity
of l-threonine over l-homoserine (Figure 3A).

and C in green) between binding site amino acids and substrates or
ligands. (A) A phosphate anion is bound in the active site of CglThrB-WT, preventing binding of substrates or inhibitors

into the active site of M. jannaschii ThrB (PDB: 1H72). (C) l-threonine bound into the active site of M. jannaschii ThrB (PDB: 1H73).

There are multiple strategies to retain wild-type ThrB activity
while decreasing affinity for the competitive inhibitor, l-threonine. One strategy is to engineer new interactions that support
substrate binding but weaken inhibitor binding. For example, one can
retain hydrophobicity of the active site responsible for binding the
ethyl moiety of the l-homoserine side chain but add steric
bulk at position A20 in C. glutamicum (corresponding to A12 in MjaThrB), promoting steric
hindrance with the methyl branch of the l-threonine side
chain. To test this strategy, A20 of CglThrB was
mutated into either a valine or a leucine residue. A second strategy
to test the importance of A20 and its role in substrate/inhibitor
binding is to change the polarity by creation of a serine mutation.
It is the least disrupting variant because it minimizes steric effects.
A third strategy is to decrease the strength of the van der Waals
interaction between the A20 and the hydrophobic portion of the corresponding
substrate/inhibitor side chain. In this case, a glycine mutation that
likely weakens van der Waals interactions between the methyl group
of l-threonine and A20 was made to evaluate its importance
in selectivity between l-threonine and l-homoserine.

CglThrB-A20G Mutant Enzyme: As Active As CglThrB-WT
Activity of each purified enzyme was
measured in an end-point assay using the ADP Colorimetric/Fluorometric
Assay Kit (Sigma-Aldrich). CglThrB-A20V and CglThrB-A20L lost their activity, but CglThrB-A20S retained 44% of the wild-type activity (Figure 4). The last mutant, CglThrB-A20G showed a similar level of enzymatic activity
to CglThrB-WT (Figure 4).

Figure 4 Enzymatic activity of WT and four variants of CglThrB. CglThrB-A20G is as active as CglThrB-WT. The concentration of ADP (Y axis) was determined
after incubating each enzyme with l-homoserine and ATP at
27 °C for 30 min. WT: CglThrB-WT, A20G: CglThrB-A20G, A20V: CglThrB-A20V, A20L: CglThrB-A20L, and A20S: CglThrB-A20S.

To further assess the enzymatic
activity of CglThrB-WT and the CglThrB-A20G variant and the effect
of changing l-homoserine concentrations, steady-state kinetic
experiments were performed with saturating concentrations of ATP.
Under these pseudo-first-order conditions, the Km for l-homoserine in CglThrB-A20G
was determined to be only 2-fold higher than the Km of CglThrB-WT and resulting in only
a 35% decrease in the specificity constant (Figure 5).

10, 20, and 50 mM l-threonine of CglThrB-WT
and CglThrB-A20G variant. Each datum represents the
value of three determinations
(n = 3). l-Threonine concentration: ●:
0 mM, ○: 10 mM, ▼: 20 mM, and ∇: 50 mM.

CglThrB-A20G
Exhibits Reduced Feedback Inhibition
by l-Threonine
Because CglThrB-A20G
was the only mutant retaining wild-type activity, that variant was
tested for changes in negative feedback inhibition by l-threonine
in an end-point assay (Figure 6) and steady-state enzyme kinetics (Figure 5). CglThrB-WT exhibits a Ki of 4.73 mM, whereas CglThrB-A20G
showed an approximately 5.4-fold higher Ki for l-threonine, with a final value of 25.22 mM (Figure 5). For example, the
5 mM l-Threonine inhibited wild-type ThrB activity by 40%
but inhibited CglThrB-A20G by only 16% (Figure 6). l-Threonine
(10 mM), which is unlikely to occur in vivo, inhibits 65% of CglThrB-WT activity but it only inhibits 38% of CglThrB-A20G activity.

Figure 6 CglThrB-A20G has eliminated
much of the feedback
inhibition while retaining wild-type enzymatic activity. The reaction
conditions were the same as those in Figure 4 except that different concentrations of l-threonine (0, 5, 10, and 20 mM) were used.

Structural Analysis of CglThrB-WT
As mentioned previously
(Figure 2), homoserine
kinases have five important regions interacting with their substrate
and inhibitor. The first structure of CglThrB-WT
solved at 1.8 Å resolution displays hydrolysis of the upper lip
as well as the helix stabilizing it, suggesting it could have an important
role in binding the substrate/inhibitor (Figure 7).

Figure 7 Hydrolyzed structure of CglThrB-WT (gold) superimposed
with the full-length CglThrB-WT (cyan) containing
modeled l-homoserine and AMP-PNP from 1H72.

The full-length structure was solved at 2.2 Å
resolution and
exhibited high B-factors for residues of both the
upper and lower lips. This fully intact structure of CglThrB-WT was obtained with three phosphate or sulfate ions in the
active site. One anion is bound in the amino acid binding site interacting
with R240, N21, and D27, which are conserved residues required for
coordinating both the α-carboxylate moiety and the α-amino
moiety of amino acid substrate or inhibitors (Figure 3). The other two ions directly interact with
the P-loop.21 Additionally, a magnesium
ion is present in the active site, resulting in the displacement of
the lower lip (Figure 8).

and the amino acid present in the active site. (A) M. jannaschii ThrB-WT with l-isoleucine,

Discussion
To promote higher levels of l-threonine
production by
fermentation of C. glutamicum, the
negative feedback inhibition of ThrB by l-threonine needs
to be suppressed. After analyses of the available structures from M. jannaschii in complex with both the end-product
inhibitor, l-threonine, and the natural substrate, l-homoserine, the alanine 12 residue, was identified as being the
only amino acid present in the active site that would allow for discrimination
of the substrate and competitive inhibitor by the enzyme. To determine
the impact of varying the conserved alanine (A20) in C. glutamicum ThrB, the A20 residue was mutated into
a leucine and a valine. These mutations were meant to introduce a
steric hindrance, preventing binding of l-threonine while
still affording the binding of the l-homoserine substrate.
Another mutation to a serine residue was also performed to introduce
polarity into the active site, creating an unfavorable environment
that rendered the active site less compatible to binding of the hydrophobic
methyl moiety of the l-threonine side chain. A final mutation
into a glycine was also introduced with the rationale that this mutation
may suppress a low-energy van der Waals interaction between the methyl
group of l-threonine and the alanine side chain, which is
an interaction that does not occur when l-homoserine binds
within the active site.

It was shown in the end-point enzyme
assay that while mutations
to either leucine or valine resulted in complete loss of activity,
the serine variant lost only 47% of WT activity. This suggests that
the steric hindrance between the amino acid ligand and the side chain
at position 20 of CglThrB has a more significant
detrimental impact on enzymatic activity than a change in polarity
at this position of the active site. This is likely due to weakening
of binding of the l-homoserine amino acid in the A20L and
A20V variants due to steric hindrance that does not occur in the A20S
variant. Alternatively, these variants may still bind the substrate
but the side-chain hydroxyl moiety of l-homoserine is then
positioned in a location or an orientation that disallows attack on
the γ-phosphate of ATP. The last variant, CglThrB-A20G, retained complete WT activity. The subsequent assays with l-threonine showed a dramatic loss of negative feedback inhibition
in CglThrB-A20G, with a Ki that is 5.3-fold lower than that of CglThrB-WT.
Because we determined the activity of CglThrB-A20G
by measuring ADP production, not o-phosphohomoserine
production, we cannot rule out the possibility that A20G mutation
simply affords the hydrolysis of ATP instead of phosphoryl transfer
to l-homoserine.

To investigate further the interaction
of l-threonine
and l-homoserine with the active site of CglThrB, the protein was crystallized. Interestingly, the first apo
structure that was solved at 1.8 Å, showed hydrolysis of the
upper lip as well as the α-helix directly adjacent due to structural
dynamics in that region, as later evidenced by elevated B-factors in the analogous region of the full-length protein structure
(Figure 7). A full-length
structure solved at 2.2 Å also shows high dynamicity of the upper
and lower lip with high B-factors in these regions.
Additionally, crystallization of both CglThrB-A20G
and CglThrB-A20V has been attempted. However, the
mutations seem to either destabilize the active site or increase flexibility
in the active site, thereby suppressing crystallization.

Because
only apo structures of CglThrB-WT (PDB: 5WAT) were obtained,
interactions between the enzymes and the amino acid substrates or
inhibitors can only be inferred from interactions observed in the M. jannaschii ThrB structures. However, three sulfate/phosphate
molecules are present in the active site and exhibit interactions
with the CglThrB enzyme that are similar to the interactions
of amino acids with the M. jannaschii active site. For instance, both N13 and R231 form identical interactions
with the sulfate present in the CglThrB-WT structure
that are analogous to interactions formed by these conserved active
site residues with the carboxylic acid moiety of the amino acid present
in M. jannaschii. Similarly, N21 and
D27 form interactions with the sulfate present in the CglThrB-WT that are comparable to interactions between MjaThrB-WT and the amino moiety of the amino acid substrate or inhibitor.
Differences were, however, observed. For example, a 1.0 to 1.7 Å
shift was observed in the position of the D139 side chain, resulting
from the absence of interactions with the amino moiety of the substrate
(Figure 3). In a similar
manner, the lack of interaction between R194 and the carboxylic moiety
of the amino acid results in the R194 side chain interacting with
solvent (Figure 3).
Additionally, although the magnesium in MjaThrB-WT
is interacting with the phosphate of APTγS and the lower lip,
it is solvent-exposed in CglThrB-WT and is coordinated
by the lower lip, resulting in interactions with the two sulfates
present in the ATP binding site. This further supports the high dynamicity
of the active site of actinobacterial ThrB.

In conclusion, we
have demonstrated that a single mutation at a
conserved residue at the active site in homoserine kinase decreases
the feedback inhibition by l-threonine while maintaining
the enzymatic activity. To our knowledge, this was the first case
where competitive feedback inhibition was successfully released via
structural analysis and site-specific mutation. A similar approach
may be used to create feedback-insensitive mutants in other biosynthetic
enzymes. Additionally, competitive inhibitors that bind to ThrB homolog
of medically important bacterial pathogens may be designed on the
basis of these determined structures.

Expression and Purification of the ThrB Proteins
All
constructs were used to transform E. coli BL21 (DE3), and transformants were grown in LB broth with 34 μg/mL
chloramphenicol. Gene expression was induced with 1 mM isopropyl -d-1-thiogalactopyranoside at mid-log phase for 3 h at 37 °C.
Cell pellets were stored at −80 °C until cells were lysed
in a 1× PBS buffer containing protease inhibitors (Roche) by
using a French Press (Thermo Scientific). Proteins were purified using
Bio-Scale Mini Profinity IMAC Cartridges and the Profinia Protein
Purification System (Bio-Rad). The proteins were then dialyzed overnight
in 25 mM Tris pH 7.4. The purified proteins were then run on a sodium
dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, stained with GelCode
Blue (Pierce Biotechnology Inc.), and visualized on ChemiDoc XRS (Bio-Rad).

In Vitro Enzyme Assay and Kinetic Analysis of ThrB
Enzyme
activity of ThrB (phosphorylation of l-homoserine)
was determined in end-point assays by measuring a reaction product
ADP via the ADP Colorimetric/Fluorometric Assay Kit (Sigma-Aldrich).
Ultrapure ATP (Sigma-Aldrich) was diluted in 10 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.0.
Enzymes (CglThrB-WT, CglThrB-A20G, CglThrB-A20V, CglThrB-A20L, and CglThrB-A20S) and l-homoserine were diluted in
an assay buffer provided by the manufacturer. Each enzyme was assayed
for 5 min at 27 °C using 40 nM enzyme, 1 mM l-homoserine,
2 mM ATP, 10 mM MgSO4, and 0.5 M KCl in 250 mM Tris pH
7.8 in a 96-well microtiter plate. The temperature was then shifted
to 99 °C for 2 min to terminate the reaction. ADP assay buffer
(Sigma-Aldrich) was added and further incubated at 27 °C for
30 min. The standard curve for ADP was obtained by incubating 0, 10,
20, 50, 100, and 200 μM of ADP in the ADP assay buffer. ADP
concentrations were monitored by the MultiskanGO microplate spectrophotometer
(Thermo Fisher Scientific) at 620 nm. Assays for the feedback inhibition
were performed similarly using 5, 10, or 20 mM l-threonine.

Kinetic analysis of CglThrB-WT and CglThrB-A20G was conducted in similar reaction conditions, with addition
of l-threonine at 0, 10, 20, or 50 mM concentrations. These
reactions were assayed with 50, 100, 200, 500, and 1000 μM homoserine.
Reads were taken at 30 s intervals. After incubating for 5 min (this
condition was determined in a separate control experiment where the
product homoserine-phosphate formation was still linearly proportional
to incubation time), ThrB was inactivated by heating at 99 °C
for 2 min. The concentration of ADP from each reaction was determined
as described above, and Km and Vmax values were determined by using the SigmaPlot
12.5 (Systat software).

Crystallization of the CglThrB-WT
The CglThrB protein concentrated
to 16.2 mg/mL in
20 mM Tris pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 50 mM KCl, and 50 mM MgCl2 was used for crystallization experiments. Using the hanging-drop
vapor diffusion method, CglThrB crystals were grown
with 2 μL of protein solution and 2 μL of well solution.
Drops were equilibrated against 100 μL of well solution containing
0.25 M ammonium sulfate, 25% poly(ethylene glycol) 3350, and 0.1 M N-(2-hydroxyethyl)piperazine-N′-ethanesulfonic
acid pH 7.5. Protein was co-crystallized with either methionine or
ATPγS and cysteine for the 1.8 and 2.2 Å structures, respectively.
No cryoprotectant was used for flash-freezing the crystals.

Diffraction
Experiments and Structural Determination of CglThrB-WT
X-ray diffraction experiments were carried
out at the LS-CAT beamline at the Advanced Photon Source of Argonne
National Labs, Argonne, IL. The CglThrB-WT structure
was solved using diffraction data collected at a wavelength of 1.07819
Å. Diffraction data were integrated and scaled using HKL300024 (Table 3).

A search model for CglThrB-WT was made on the
basis of the 4rpf structure and used for molecular replacement using
Phaser in PHENIX. Rigid body refinement, simulated annealing, positional,
and B-factor refinements were performed using PHENIX.25 Manual refinement of both structures was performed
using COOT.26
