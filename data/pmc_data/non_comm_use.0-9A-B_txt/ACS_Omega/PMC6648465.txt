The
robust adhesion of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs)
to plastic substrates is a key issue toward their use in flexible
electronic devices. In this work, semitransparent SWCNT films were
prepared by spray-coating on two different plastic substrates, specifically
poly(ethylene terephthalate) and poly(vinylidene fluoride). The deposited
SWCNT films were treated by dipping in suitable solvents separately,
namely, 53% nitric acid (HNO3) and N-methyl
pyrrolidone. Direct evidence of SWCNT adhesion to the substrate was
obtained by a peel-off test carried out with an adhesive tape. Moreover,
these treatments caused enhanced film transparency and electrical
conductivity. Electron microscopy images suggested that SWCNTs were
embedded in the plastic substrates, forming a thin layer of conductive
composite materials. Raman spectroscopy detected a certain level of
doping in the SWCNTs after the chemical treatments, which particularly
affected metallic nanotubes in the case of the HNO3 treatment.
The microscopic adhesion and hardness of the SWCNT films were studied
through a nanoscratch test. Overall, the efficiency of selected chemical
postdeposition treatments for improving the SWCNT adhesion and the
robustness of the resulting SWCNT films are demonstrated on flexible
substrates of different chemical compositions.

Introduction
Due to their remarkable structural and
physical properties at the
nanoscale (high electrical conductivity, tensile strength, flexibility,
elasticity, thermal conductivity, high chemical stability, and low
thermal expansion coefficient), carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and graphene
are promising candidates for the development of novel electronic devices,1,2 in particular, for the fabrication of functional transparent conducting
films (TCFs).3 Potential applications of
CNT-TCFs include thin-film transistors, electronic displays, solar
cell components, electroluminescent devices, supercapacitors, and
sensors.4 In addition, CNT-TCFs have been
proposed as an alternative to indium tin oxide, being more easily
incorporated on flexible substrates.5−7

Several methods
are currently being utilized to fabricate CNT-TCFs,
including direct CNT growth by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) and
CNT deposition from liquid dispersions. Remarkable progress has been
recently achieved using CVD methods, particularly by the dry floating
catalyst technique.8 On the other hand,
dispersion techniques are versatile and suitable for many different
manufacturing processes.9 In particular,
spray-coating is one of the most popular since it is simple, cost
effective, repeatable, and can be easily scaled up.10

A good CNT adhesion to the substrate is an essential
requirement
toward CNT applications in electronics. A lack of chemical and mechanical
stability in the functional films limits their applications, whereas
film robustness extends the device lifetime. Several physical treatments
have been tested to boost the CNT-TCF adhesion, such as the use of
acrylic binders,11 deposition of an interlayer,12 hot pressing transfer process,13 and microwave irradiation,14 to name a few. Azoubel and Magdassi improved the adhesion of single-walled
carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) deposited on poly(ethylene terephthalate)
(PET) by dipping in various acids, including nitric acid.15 Similar treatments with oxidant acids have also
shown to enhance the electrical conductivity of CNT-TCFs.16−18 The increase in electrical conductivity has been attributed both
to a p-type doping and to a decrease in the cross-junction resistance
between CNTs.19,20

In this work, we further
explore the use of TCF immersion methodologies
to improve the SWCNT film adhesion on flexible polymer substrates,
specifically poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) and PET. We here show
that an optimized postdeposition treatment with nitric acid is valid
for SWCNT-TCFs on plastics that are sensitive to oxidation, such as
PET. PVDF provides remarkable electromechanical and dielectric properties
and high chemical stability for biological and outdoor electronic
applications.21−23 However, nitric acid treatments are not useful for
the relatively inert substrate PVDF, which is resistant to most inorganic
solvents, aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons, organic acids, alcohols,
and halogenated solvents. Only some dipolar aprotic solvents, such
as dimethylformamide (DMF) or N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone
(NMP), dissolve PVDF.24

It is here
demonstrated that postdeposition immersion methods can
be generalized to provide a robust adhesion of SWCNTs on different
plastic substrates. A peel-off test performed with an adhesive tape
is used as a first evidence of adhesion improvement. Besides, it is
shown that the peel-off process can be considered a strategy for the
removal of the excess SWCNT from the film after the immersion treatment.
The effects of the immersion treatment and the peel-off process are
discussed in terms of film transparency, electrical conductivity,
thickness, morphology, and hardness, as well as the possible SWCNT
doping.

Results and Discussion
Transparency and Sheet Resistance
Films of SWCNTs on
PET and PVDF substrates were prepared by spray-coating, as it is described
in the Experimental section. By adjusting
spray-gun parameters, such as air pressure, liquid flow, and distance
to the substrate, uniform films were fabricated, which were ready
for the immersion treatments and adhesion assessment.

Prior
to the attainment of the results presented in this article, the immersion
time and the solution composition were optimized. The immersion time
was varied from 5 to 180 min. Concentrations of nitric acid in the
range of 35–65% were tested for SWCNT-PET films. Besides, it
was confirmed that no effect was produced on SWCNT adhesion to PVDF
by dipping in nitric acid. Thus, solvent mixtures of DMF and NMP in
the whole concentration range were tested for SWCNT-PVDF films. According
to direct inspection and the adhesive tape test, the optimal conditions
were found to be 52% HNO3 and 120 min for SWCNT-PET films
and 100% NMP and 50 min for SWCNT-PVDF films. The results of the peel-off
experiments are shown in Figure 1. It has to be commented that too high HNO3 concentrations or long treatment times may lead to damage in the
plastic substrate.

and
SWCNT-PVDF films, respectively. Pictures of the films: I, as prepared;
II, untreated and peeled off; III, immersion treated and nonpeeled
off; IV, immersion treated and peeled off.

The transparency at 550 nm (T) and sheet
resistance
(Rs) values of the SWCNT-TCFs were measured
before and after the dipping treatment and the peel-off test (Figure 2). Typically, transparencies
of the starting SWCNT films were in the range of 50–60%, improving
to nearly 70% after the immersion treatment and the peel-off process.
Some variations can be observed in the value and trend of T and Rs parameters for SWCNT
films on PET and PVDF, which might reflect the different properties
of the substrates. Looking through SWCNT films, images are sharp but
somewhat darkened. Thus, the films can be described as semitransparent.
Quantification of the adhesion can be defined by an adhesion factor
incorporating absorbance (A) data25 1  where f is the adhesion factor,
and A0 and An are, respectively, the absorbance of the SWCNT film before and after
the considered process. When An = A0, f = 1 and no SWCNTs were
lost in the process, therefore demonstrating perfect adhesion. On
the contrary, when f = 0, no SWCNTs are left on the
film, demonstrating no adhesion. The values of f for
the specimen series are listed in Table 1.

According
to Figure 2a, no substantial
changes in the film transparency were observed
comparing before (fI = 1) and after the
immersion treatments (fIII = 1.06). On
the contrary, the transparency increased drastically when the untreated
films were peeled off (fII,PET = 0.20
and fII,PVDF = 0.07 compared to fI). As the SWCNT coating is removed from the
substrate by the tape, the transparency increases, revealing poor
adhesion. On the other hand, if the SWCNT film has good adhesion to
the plastic substrate, the SWCNT coating remains. In fact, once the
films underwent the immersion treatments, the SWCNTs stuck to the
substrates with fairly good adhesion (fIV,PET = 0.65 and fIV,PVDF = 0.75).

As
it is observed in Figure 2b, together with the adhesion improvement, the electrical
conductivity increased (the sheet resistance Rs decreased) after the immersion treatments. This reduction
in Rs has been associated with the removal
of the sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) surfactant and with electrical
doping.16−20 The possibility of doping effects will be later considered in the
discussion of Raman spectroscopy results. Besides, Rs measurements also evidence the adhesion improvement
with the treatment. When the peel-off test was performed on the untreated
films, the SWCNTs were removed from the plastic substrates and, as
a consequence, Rs values significantly
increased. However, when the films were chemically treated, the SWCNT
network connectivity largely remains after the tape test.

Thickness
Changes in the film absorbance can be associated
with the thickness (t). Profilometry measurements
were performed on a series of untreated SWCNT films, with different
transparencies (in particular seven samples between 21.7 and 77.4%
transmittance). Therefore, a calibration line (t vs A) was obtained to calculate film thicknesses from transmittance
measurements (Table 1). An interesting conclusion that can be drawn from Table 1 is that dipping treatments
on both PET and PVDF substrates lead to nearly identical results in
terms of SWCNT-TCF thickness.

Direct measurements of the thickness
in SWCNT-TCFs are quite challenging, and data for comparison are scarce
in the literature. Most of the available reports in the field only
present transparency as an indirect measurement, and the available
thickness data are usually calculated through different assumptions.
Itkis et al. calculated the thickness of SWCNT-TCFs prepared by vacuum
filtration assuming a theoretical film bulk density.26 These authors measured t values in the
0.5–8.0 nm range, which are quite lower than our data (Table 1). Closer values to
our data were reported by Abdelhalim et al. by atomic force microscopy
(AFM) on SWCNT-TCFs prepared by transfer printing on glass and plastic
substrates (in the 10–25 nm range for 50–90% transparency).6 Also, Li et al. measured t values
of 40 nm by AFM for an SWCNT-TCF with a transparency of 78% at 550
nm.27 Therefore, our perfilometer measurements
are in good agreement with data reported by Abdelhalim et al. and
Geng et al., although being somewhat larger at similar transparencies,
which might be due to the different in-plane measurement ranges.

The bulk conductivity (σ) can be then calculated by measuring
the film thickness (t) and sheet resistance (Rs) as 2  The σ values are included in Table 1. In this work, σ
values ranging from 46 to 220 S cm–1 have been calculated
for the treated SWCNT-TCFs. The values are in good agreement with
those deduced from Itkis et al.,26 being
approximately 40 and 450 S cm–1 for 33 and 99% metallic
SWCNT-TCFs, respectively. Also, σ values of 48 and 83 S cm–1 are given by Tsai et al.28 for CNT films with thicknesses of 230 and 110 nm, respectively.
Somewhat higher σ values can be calculated from Li et al.,27 reaching 550 and 2100 S cm–1 in water-washed and nitric acid treated SWCNT-TCFs, and from Abdelhalim
et al.,6 reaching 600–1600 S cm–1 for SWCNTs on a PET substrate and 1000–2600
S cm–1 on glass.

So far, the results evidence
the beneficial effects of the immersion
treatments in the SWCNT adhesion to the substrate and in the film’s
electrical conductivity as well. Besides, the peel-off process removes
the excess of SWCNTs from the immersion-treated films, improving the
transparency while maintaining the electrical conductivity. Therefore,
the peel-off process can be considered as a method for the preparation
of thin SWCNT-TCFs from the starting coatings.

Scanning Electron Microscopy
(SEM) Characterization
From now on, further studies on the
effect of dipping and peel-off
treatments are presented only for the IV samples (Figure 1) in both PET and PVDF substrates
and compared to the initial coatings (I samples in Figure 1). Actually, the peeled-off
samples are the most appropriate ones for the present study, as adhesion
phenomena take place in the deepest region of the original coating,
where the SWCNTs are in close contact with the polymer surface during
the immersion treatment.

SEM characterization studies (Figure 3) were conducted
to identify changes in the SWCNT-TCF surface morphology. In all the
cases, SWCNTs appear in the form of quite large bundles. An intense
bundling effect of the SDS surfactant on SWCNT-TCFs has been previously
revealed in comparison with other surfactants.29 In spite of using the same initial SWCNT dispersion, PET
and PVDF substrates lead to substantially different films since their
respective surface properties are different.

Figure 3 SEM images (scale bar
= 100 nm) of SWCNT films on PET (a, b) and
PVDF (c, d) before (a, c) and after (b, d) the immersion and peeling-off
treatments.

In Figure 3a,c,
a high density of SWCNT bundles is observed in the starting SWCNT-PET
and SWCNT-PVDF films. However, a change in the film appearance occurs
during the treatments (Figure 3b,d). The SWCNTs that were too far from the substrate (the
deposited SWCNT excess) were removed during the peel-off test, so
only the well-adhered SWCNTs remained. These stuck SWCNTs might be
embedded within the PET and PVDF substrates, as it was suggested in
previous works on PET,15 and in a silica-type
material after laser annealing.30 Following
those references, we suggest that HNO3 and NMP might soften
the surfaces of PET and PVDF, respectively, leading to the formation
of a robust TCF of an SWCNT/polymer composite. Since the immersion
time was optimized, SWCNTs would be embedded avoiding the substantial
substrate damage. It is here demonstrated that the mechanism of SWCNT
adhesion is nearly identical on PET and PVDF substrates, although
the immersion treatment was performed in different solvents.

Raman
Spectroscopy
Raman spectroscopy was performed
for the identification of possible changes in the physical and chemical
properties of SWCNTs that result from the abovementioned chemical
procedures, particularly in the optoelectronic properties and the
occurrence of electronic doping. Spectra were acquired by mapping
over 400 locations for each sample, using 2.33 eV laser excitation
energy. The average profiles are represented in Figure 4. The Raman spectrum of SWCNTs presents several
features, among which the most intense ones are the radial breathing
modes (RBMs, Figure 4 insets), whose Raman shift ranges from 100 to 400 cm–1, and the tangential modes (G-band) centered at 1588 cm–1. Additionally, for SWCNTs containing structural defects, the disorder-induced
mode (D-band) is observed at around 1330 cm–1. In Figure 4a, the Raman spectra
include contributions from the PET substrate at 1288, 1415, 1460,
and 1615 cm–1.

Figure 4 Resonance Raman spectra of SWCNT-PET (a)
and SWCNT-PVDF (b) films
before (line) and after (dots line) the immersion and peeling-off
treatments.

Using the RBM frequency,
the diameter of SWCNTs (dt) can be estimated.31 The
positions of the most intense RBM bands are in the following ranges:
165–210 cm–1 (dt = 1.48–1.13 nm), 225–255 cm–1 (dt = 1.05–0.93 nm), 255–295 cm–1 (dt = 0.93–0.86
nm), and 300–340 cm–1 (dt = 0.79–0.70 nm). Comparing the SWCNT-PET and
SWCNT-PVDF films, the relative intensities of the RBM are different,
which might be associated with the particular morphologies of the
SWCNT deposits, as described above (Figure 3). The electronic transitions can be assigned
using the Kataura plot.32 The insets of Figure 4a,b are divided into
two regions that correspond to SWCNTs excited via the E11M and E22S electronic transitions. Hence, certain semiconducting and
metallic SWCNTs were in resonance with the 2.33 eV excitation energy.
A change in the RBM intensity is observed in the SWCNTs in resonance
via the E11M for the SWCNT-PET
HNO3-treated film.

An increase in the D-band intensity
is observed after the immersion
treatments. It means that some defects were generated as a result
of the treatment with HNO3 and NMP, more remarkably in
the case of HNO3. However, the new defects introduced in
the treated and peeled-off SWCNTs not only do not cause a decrease
in the overall conductivity of the SWCNT-PET and SWCNT-PVDF films
but, instead, also lead to increased conductivity values due to charge
transfer doping and surfactant degradation induced by SWCNT dipping
in nitric acid and NMP.19,20

The G-band was
slightly but consistently blue-shifted from 1586
to 1589 cm–1 and from 1586 to 1588 cm–1 after the HNO3 and NMP dipping treatments on SWCNT-PET
and SWCNT-PVDF films, respectively. These upshifts can be understood
as a consequence of doping and due to changes in the surface chemistry
of specific SWCNTs. Thus, according to observations in the RBM, the
changes induced by nitric acid treatments are particularly noticeable
for metallic-type SWCNTs (165–210 cm–1, dt = 1.48–1.13 nm). Besides, the HNO3-treated SWCNT-PET films presented changes in the G-band width
compared to the untreated films, confirming small modifications in
the metallic character of SWCNTs that can be related to the reactivity
of metallic SWCNTs in nitric acid, in good agreement with previous
literature.33,34 As it was pointed above, doping
by HNO3 has been proposed to contribute to the reduction
of the Rs values.19,20 In addition, it is known that nitrogen containing solvents induce
doping effects on SWCNTs.35

Therefore,
both HNO3 and NMP immersion treatments induce
doping in SWCNTs and create some electronic distortion (defects).
In particular, HNO3 gives rise to a larger number of defects,
probably due to its oxidant character. Under ambient conditions, metallic
SWCNTs are more sensitive than semiconducting SWCNTs to the oxidative
effect of HNO3.

AFM Roughness and Scratch Test
The
surface topographies
of the SWCNT-PET and SWCNT-PVDF films (samples I and IV) were examined
by AFM, and roughness parameters were obtained with AFM analysis software
(Table 2). The average
roughness (Ra) for the image is defined
as the arithmetic average of the absolute values of the surface height
deviations from the central plane. The Ra value is a measurement of surface homogeneity.

Table 2 Ra of
the SWCNT Films Measured by AFM
film sample	Ra (nm)	
SWCNT-PET as prepared—I	61	
SWCNT-PET HNO3 treated peeled off—IV	86	
SWCNT-PVDF as prepared—I	421	
SWCNT-PVDF NMP treated peeled off—IV	547	
The Ra parameter for the
SWCNT-PET
film was significantly lower than for the SWCNT-PVDF film. The difference
might be associated with the resulting morphology of the SWCNT deposit,
which substantially varies for both substrates, according to SEM images
(Figure 3). On the
other hand, relatively small increases in the Ra values were detected after the peel-off process on both substrates.
The Ra factor exceeds by far the nanotube
bundle diameter, so the change has to be associated with the surface
distribution of randomly oriented SWCNT aggregates and SWCNT/polymer
aggregates. Therefore, the Ra values confirm
the efficiency of the peel-off process in the uniform removal of the
SWCNT excess layer. Also, the surface homogeneity has to be taken
into account for the interpretation of the other AFM data.

A
relatively hard AFM tip was utilized to evaluate the resistance
of SWCNT-TCFs to indentation and scratch. When the cantilever tip
moves along the surface (X–Y axis), some material may be detached depending on the applied vertical
force (Z-axis). The released material accumulates
at the sides of the scratch line and in some regions of the scanned
area. The AFM in a topography mode was used to examine the surface
of the SWCNT-PET and SWCNT-PVDF films before and after the scratch
experiments (Figure 5). Each sample was tested at nine forces from 0.5 to 25 μN,
and a 10 × 10 μm2 area was scanned at each loading
force. Therefore, images in Figure 5 show the effects of scanning nine square regions in
a 3 × 3 matrix, ordered by decreasing load from left to right
and from top to down. It can be observed that the highest loads cause
the largest damage to the substrate.

Figure 5 AFM topography images showing the results
of scratch tests (forces
between 0.5 and 25 μm) on PET (a, b) and PVDF (c, d) before
(a, c) and after (b, d) the immersion and peeling-off treatments.

To analyze the effect of the scratch
tests, an average depth was
calculated for each 10 × 10 μm2 area and plotted
as a function of the normal load (Figure 6). The SWCNT-PET and SWCNT-PVDF films bear
forces of 3 and 2 μN, respectively. An increasing damage occurs
for higher loadings, independent of the immersion treatment. Since
the scratch depth soon becomes larger than the SWCNT thickness, it
is deduced that damage is being caused to the substrate. Only the
initial damage at 3 and 2 μN, respectively, for PET and PVDF
films might be associated with the SWCNT layer. Anyways, the chemical
postdeposition treatments do not modify the force required to break
the surface with the AFM tip.

Figure 6 Plots showing variations of depth with the applied
load for the
SWCNT-PET (a) (squares) and SWCNT-PVDF (b) (circles) films before
(full markers) and after (empty markers) the immersion and peeling-off
treatments.

The substrate damage,
given by the scratch depths, logically increases
with load. In both SWCNT-PET and SWCNT-PVDF films, the depth at analogous
loads is lower for chemically treated samples. Therefore, the immersion
treatment leads to an increase in the surface hardness, which might
be associated with the improvement in the SWCNT-TCF adhesion to the
substrate. Both the SWCNT-PET and SWCNT-PVDF films behave in analogous
ways, indicating that the different chemical treatments produced analogous
effects and thus analogous mechanisms against external mechanical
forces. This fact confirms the suitability of generalizing the use
of dipping treatments described here to improve the SWCNT-TCF adhesion
on a variety of plastic substrates.

Conclusions
In
the present work, it is demonstrated that the adhesion of SWCNT-TCFs
on polymer substrates, specifically PET and PVDF, is improved by dipping
the films in nitric acid solutions and NMP, respectively. It has to
be emphasized that the immersion methodology is operational with highly
resistant thermoplastics such as PVDF. Besides, the Rs values of the SWCNT-TCFs decreased after the immersion
treatment, and their transparency increased after a peel-off process.
It is also suggested that the SWCNTs would be embedded into both polymer
substrates after the treatments. Therefore, the resulting SWCNT layers
adhered to the PET and PVDF substrates after the peeling process can
be considered as mixed SWCNT/polymer composites. In this way, it would
be possible to obtain thin, conductive, and semitransparent SWCNT-TCFs
in an easy, cheap, and reproducible way. Hardness of treated SWCNT
coatings improved as compared to the nontreated surfaces. Based on
several characterization techniques, it is confirmed that the modification
of the SWCNT-TCF during the dipping treatments occurs through analogous
mechanisms in both PET and PVDF. Flexible SWCNT-TCF films with improved
electrical and adhesion properties can be fabricated in different
plastic substrates. Therefore, it can be considered that the immersion
procedures described here might be effective on any polymer substrate
just by selecting a suitable solvent. The excellent adhesion of the
films enables an improved mechanical stability, which is essential
for the application of SWCNT-TCFs in electronics.

Experimental
Section
Materials
Pristine HiPco SWCNTs (diameter 0.8–1.2
nm, length 100–1000 nm, TGA residual mass <35%) were purchased
from Nanointegris (Boisbriand, Canada). PET slides, 0.1 mm thick,
were supplied by Schwan Stabilo. Flexible PVDF substrates that were
0.1 mm thick were purchased from Goodfellow. Sodium dodecyl sulfate
(SDS, ≥98.5%), nitric acid (70%, AR grade), and NMP (99.5%)
were provided by Sigma-Aldrich.

Preparation of SWCNT Coatings
and Postdeposition Treatments
The starting SWCNT material
was dispersed at a concentration of
1 mg mL–1 in 0.5% SDS aqueous solutions by 1 h probe
sonication (Hielscher UP400S sonicator, operating at 60% amplitude
and 0.5 cycles). The samples were cooled in an ice-water bath during
the sonication process. Next, the SWCNT dispersion was purified by
ultracentrifugation at 200 000g for 1 h. In
this way, the SWCNTs are individualized and purified through the removal
of big aggregates, amorphous carbon and metal catalyst impurities,
prior to deposition.36

Afterward,
the purified SWCNT inks were air-sprayed on PET and PVDF substrates
using a Sagola Premium 475 spray gun at approximately 1 mL cm–2. The substrates were kept at 50 °C during spray-coating
to help water evaporation. To remove the SDS surfactant, the SWCNT-PET
and SWCNT-PVDF films were plunged in water for 4 h and dried overnight
at room temperature.

The treatment for improving the adhesion
was performed by immersion
in a plate containing the treatment solution or solvent at room temperature.
The SWCNT-PET and SWCNT-PVDF films were dipped in 35–65% HNO3 and DMF/NMP, respectively, for 5–180 min. Conditions
of concentration and time were optimized to produce an adhesion effect
while preventing damage of the plastic substrate. Following the immersion,
the samples were dried at room temperature overnight.

The adhesion
properties of as-sprayed and treated films were in
the first place assessed by the simple peel-off tape test using 810
Scotch Magic Tape.

Characterization Techniques
The
SWCNT-TCF transparency
was assessed by measuring the visible light transmittance (T %) at 550 nm in a Shimadzu UV-2401PC spectrometer. The
film thickness was calibrated with a Bruker Stylus Profiler model
Dektak XT.

The sheet resistance was measured in a two-probe
configuration using a Keithley 4200 unit provided with tungsten needles.
Two silver electrodes were painted along the longest sides of each
SWCNT-PET and SWNCT-PVDF film. Sheet resistance (Rs) values were calculated taking into account the film
geometry, given by the distance between the electrodes and their length.

The homogeneity of the films and the changes caused by the immersion
treatment were evaluated by Raman spectroscopy and microscopy techniques.
Raman spectra were acquired under ambient conditions using a LabRAM
HR Raman spectrometer (Horiba Jobin-Yvon) with a laser excitation
energy of 2.33 eV (532 nm). Raman maps of 400 data points were collected
with lateral steps of 1 μm, in both X and Y directions, on rectangular areas. Microscopic characterization
was conducted in a field emission scanning electron microscope (SEM)
model MERLIN (Carl Zeiss, Switzerland), whereas atomic force microscopy
(AFM) measurements were carried out in Multimode SPM equipment from
Veeco Instruments (Santa Barbara, U.S.).

Scratch Tests
Scratch tests were performed in the Veeco
AFM setup with an MPP-13120-10 Bruker AFM probe 8 nm nominal tip radius.
The scratch tests were carried out at 2 μm s–1 applying various loads (0.5, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 10, 15, and 25 μN).
Square areas of 10 × 10 μm2 were scanned at
each loading.

The AFM in the topography mode (area 70 ×
70 μm2) was used to examine the surface of the SWCNT-PET
and SWCNT-PVDF films before and after the scratch experiments. The
topography before the scratch test was used as a reference and subtracted
to the final topography. In this way, the starting roughness of the
surface is removed and the scratching effect is isolated. To analyze
the depths of the scratches, statistical analyses in the whole scratched
squares were performed. Histograms of the height inside and outside
the scratched squares were taken into account.
