Orthorhombic Mo–V oxide is
one of the most active solid-state
catalysts for selective oxidation of alkane, and revealing its detailed
structure is important for understanding reaction mechanisms and for
the design of better catalysts. We report the single-crystal X-ray
structure analysis of orthorhombic Mo–V oxide heated under
a N2 flow; V is present in 6-membered rings with partial
occupancy, similar to the structure reported by Trunschke’s
group for orthorhombic Mo–V oxide heated under an Ar flow (Trunschke  , ACS Catal. 2017 , 7 , 3061 ). Our previous paper (Ishikawa  , J. Phys. Chem. C , 2015 , 119 , 7195 ) reported that V is not present
in the 6-membered rings when orthorhombic Mo–V oxide is calcined
in the presence of oxygen. Furthermore, Trunschke’s paper reported
that V in the 6-membered rings moves to the surface of the crystals
under oxidation reaction conditions in the presence of H2O. Our present results provide additional evidence for V migration
in the 6-membered rings during heat treatment. We also report the
differences in the thermal behaviors, ultraviolet–visible absorptions,
N2 isotherms, and elemental analysis results of Mo–V
oxide heated in air and under a N2 flow. Furthermore, we
report the solid-state transformation of orthorhombic Mo–V
oxide to tetragonal Mo–V oxide by controlled heat treatment.

Introduction
Orthorhombic Mo–V
oxide is one of the most active solid-state
catalysts for selective oxidation of ethane to ethylene,1−3 propane to acrylic acid3,4 or acrylonitrile,5 acrolein to acrylic acid,1 and alcohols to carboxyl compounds.6 Orthorhombic
Mo–V oxide features slabs comprising 6- and 7-membered rings
of corner-sharing MO6 octahedra (M = Mo or V) and pentagonal
Mo6O21 units with a MoO7 pentagonal
bipyramidal unit and five edge-sharing MoO6 octahedra (Figure 1a,b).7,8 Stacking of the 6- and 7-membered rings constructs channel structures,
and the 7-membered channel is a micropore with a diameter of ca. 0.4
nm that gases smaller than or equal to ethane can enter.9 We have revealed that the pore diameter and volume
can be tuned continuously and reversibly through redox treatment such
as heating under H2 flow or in air,10 but this cannot be realized in the cases of other microporous
materials such as zeolites and metal–organic frameworks.

Mo–V oxide: (a, c) a–b plane and (b, d) b–c plane.
Dark polyhedra in (a) and (b) represent pentagonal Mo6O21 units. The black circle and dotted circle in (a) indicate
6- and 7-membered rings, respectively.

The structure of orthorhombic Mo–V oxide has been examined
using single-crystal X-ray structure analysis using synchrotron radiation,
atomic-scale transmission electron microscopy techniques, and gas
adsorption techniques. We have reported that orthorhombic Mo–V
oxide after heating at 673 K in air (AH Mo–V oxide) has no metallic ions in either the 6- or 7-membered channels.11 Furthermore, we have also reported that Sb is
incorporated in both 6- and 7-membered channels in the case of Sb-containing
orthorhombic Mo–V–Sb oxide.12

On the other hand, Trunschke’s group has reported that
V
is partially present in the 6-membered channel when the orthorhombic
Mo–V oxide is heated in Ar.13 They
also reported that V migrates into the 6-membered channel during heating
in Ar and the incorporated V is released from the channel under propane
oxidation conditions with H2O. This finding is very important
for the design of catalysts because the dynamics of V may affect the
catalyst performance.

Furthermore, Valent’s group has
reported removal of Te from
channels of Nb and Te containing orthorhombic Mo–V–Te–Nb
oxide at high temperatures that cause destruction of the active orthorhombic
structure.14 It is very important to understand
the thermal behavior of the orthorhombic Mo–V-based oxide.

Orthorhombic Mo–V oxide was synthesized from a reaction
mixture of ammonium heptamolybdate, (NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O, and vanadyl sulfate,
VOSO4·nH2O, with a Mo/V
ratio of 4 in H2O under hydrothermal conditions. The crude
material contained an amorphous species that was removed by washing
the products with aqueous oxalic acid to afford pure orthorhombic
Mo–V oxide (fresh Mo–V oxide). The preparation
conditions and resulting Mo/V ratio of our Mo–V oxide were
slightly different from those of Trunschke’s Mo–V oxide13 (Table 1). It is very interesting to confirm the presence of V in
the hexagonal channel when the orthorhombic Mo–V oxide was
heated under a nonoxidative atmosphere.

In this article, we describe the
single-crystal structure analysis
of our orthorhombic Mo–V oxide heated under a nitrogen flow
(NH Mo–V oxide) and its thermal behavior difference
between in air and under a nitrogen atmosphere.

Results and Discussion
Preparation
and Characterization of Orthorhombic Mo–V
Oxide
Orthorhombic Mo–V oxide was synthesized and
purified according to our reported method (fresh Mo–V
oxide),11 and fresh Mo–V
oxide was heated at 673 K in air or under a N2 flow
to produce air-heated or nitrogen-heated Mo–V oxide, AH Mo–V oxide or NH Mo–V oxide,
respectively. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) of the Mo–V oxides
indicated that they are stable after heating at 673 K (Figure 2). No monoxide such as MoO3 and V2O5 is observed.

Figure 2 Powder XRD patterns of
(a) fresh Mo–V oxide, (b) AH Mo–V
oxide, and (c) NH Mo–V oxide.

Thermal gravimetry (TG) analysis and temperature-programed desorption–mass
spectroscopy (TPD–MS) of fresh Mo–V oxide indicated that both water and NH4+ in the
micropores are removed at up to ca. 673 K (Figure S1a). Infrared spectra showed that the absorption at 1410 cm–1 corresponding to NH4+ was absent
for both heated samples (Figure S2). On
the other hand, elemental analysis indicated the presence of nitrogen
in both calcined samples (Table 2). TPD–MS of AH Mo–V oxide and NH Mo–V oxide did not provide signals corresponding
to NH3 released from NH4+, but signals
corresponding to N2 and O2 for AH Mo–V
oxide and N2 for NH Mo–V oxide were detected when water molecules were evaporated from the samples
(Figure S1b,c). These results indicate
that gases present during heat treatment are trapped in the micropores.
The elemental analyses also indicated that the Mo/V ratios did not
change as a result of the heating treatments (Table 2). The ultraviolet–visible absorption
between 400 and 1000 nm of NH Mo–V oxide was higher
than that of AH Mo–V oxide (Figure S3), indicating that Mo and V are more reduced in NH Mo–V oxide. Orthorhombic Mo–V oxide is prepared
by mixing Mo6+ and V4+; the valences of Mo are
6+ and 5+ and those of V are 5+ and 4+ in fresh Mo–V
oxide.11 We have reported that reduction
of orthorhombic Mo–V oxide decreases the micropore volumes
in the 7-membered channels, estimated from N2 isotherms,
without the collapse of the crystal structure.10 The N2 isotherms indicated that the micropore
volume of NH Mo–V oxide is lower than that of AC Mo–V oxide (Figure S4), confirming the presence of more reduced Mo and V in NH Mo–V
oxide compared to AH Mo–V oxide.

Single-Crystal
Structure Analysis of Orthorhombic Mo–V
Oxide Heated under a N2 Flow (NH Mo–V Oxide)
Single-crystal structure analysis revealed that the metal and oxygen
positions of NH Mo–V oxide are similar to those
of AH Mo–V oxide and Trunschke’s Mo–V
oxide heated under an Ar flow (Figure 3 and Table 3). The metal sites of the pentagonal unit (M1, M2, M3, M4,
M5, and M6) are occupied exclusively by Mo, and other metal sites
are occupied by both Mo and V with different occupancies. Trunschke’s
group reported that Mo is exclusively occupied in M7 site, but our
results indicate both Mo and V occupy M7 site. Disorder in some metal
sites (M8 and M9) along the z direction was detected,
and this was also observed in the case of AH Mo–V oxide. However, Trunschke’s Mo–V oxide does not include
such disorder. These difference may be caused by different synthesis
conditions and/or different characterization methods. There is clear
electron density in the 6-membered ring at a position similar to that
of partially occupying V in Trunschke’s Mo–V oxide calcined
under an Ar flow13 and Sb in our Mo–V–Sb
oxide,12 which can be attributed to partially
occupied V12 in the 6-membered ring. The V12 is coordinated by two
equatorial oxygens of the 6-membered ring and one oxygen atom which
does not belong to the framework of the orthorhombic structure. We
have reported that there is no clear electron density suitable for
V in the 6-membered ring in the case of AH Mo–V oxide.(11)

Trunschke’s group reported that V12
enters the 6-membered
rings during heat treatment under Ar and exits from the 6-membered
rings to the surface of the crystals under oxidative conditions with
H2O.13 They proposed that there
are two possible sources of V: (1) V in the frameworks of fresh
Mo–V oxide moves into the 6-membered rings due to heating
without oxygen, while the V in the 6-membered ring goes to the surface
of the crystals owing to calcination in the presence of oxygen and
H2O, and (2) V present on the surface of the crystal migrates
into the 6-membered rings owing to heating without oxygen, while the
V in the 6-membered ring goes back to the surface of the crystal owing
to calcination in the presence of oxygen and H2O. We could
not successfully perform the single-crystal structure analysis of fresh Mo–V oxide. Therefore, we cannot specify the
source of V in the 6-membered rings. However, our present results
provide additional evidence for the movement of V during heat treatment.
Orthorhombic Mo–V oxide is redox active and acts as an active
oxidation catalyst, and the V migration may be one of the most important
phenomena controlling catalytic activity; further investigation is
underway in our laboratory.

Thermal Behavior of Orthorhombic Mo–V
Oxide
We found that the thermal behaviors of AH Mo–V
oxide and NH Mo–V oxide are also different
(Figure 4). Thermal
gravimetry–differential
thermal analysis (TG–DTA) of fresh Mo–V oxide was performed either in air or under a N2 flow (Figure S5a,b). As indicated above, the weight
losses at up to ca. 673 K correspond to the releases of H2O and NH3. When the temperature was increased further
in air, there were exothermic weight losses starting at ca. 750 K,
followed by weight gains. Figure S6 shows
the XRD patterns of fresh Mo–V oxide heated in
air at different temperatures. The pattern for orthorhombic Mo–V
oxide was observed after calcination at 723 K. After heating at 773
K, a new pattern corresponding to tetragonal (Mo5–xVx)O14 (tetragonal Mo–V oxide)15 was observed together with other peaks that are the main peaks when
calcination is performed at 873 K.

Figure 4 Difference in the thermal behaviors of
Mo–V oxide calcined
in air and under a N2 flow.

On the other hand, TG–DTA of fresh Mo–V oxide under a N2 flow did not show the exothermic weight loss
followed by the weight gain and the orthorhombic structure was stable
after heating at 873 K (Figures S5b and S6e).

When AH Mo–V oxide was heated under a N2 flow, the exothermic weight loss
followed by weight gain
was not observed, but slight weight loss at temperatures between 800
and 840 K was observed (Figure S5c). The
slight weight loss corresponds to the transformation of orthorhombic
Mo–V oxide to tetragonal Mo–V oxide. Heating
of AH Mo–V oxide at 823 K under a N2 flow produced a mixture of orthorhombic Mo–V oxide and tetragonal Mo–V oxide, and heating at 848 K produced
pure tetragonal Mo–V oxide (Figure 5a–c). Further heating at 873 K decreased
the peak intensity.

Figure 5 Powder XRD patterns of samples obtained after calcination
of AH Mo–V oxide at (a) 773, (b) 823, (c) 848,
and (d)
873 K under a N2 flow. Closed circles indicate peaks for tetragonal Mo–V oxide.

Similar to orthorhombic Mo–V oxide, tetragonal (Mo5–xVx)O14 has
a stacked structure with slabs comprising 6-membered rings of corner-sharing
MO6 octahedra (M = Mo or V) and pentagonal M6O21 units (Figure 1c,d).15 Therefore, no micropores
from 7-membered rings were observed (Figure S4) and no gases were trapped in the micropores (Table 2). The numbers of metals and oxygen atoms
in the unit cell of orthorhombic Mo–V oxide are the same as
those of tetragonal (Mo5–xVx)O14; therefore, it is possible to
transform without formation of other phase under a suitable condition.
High-angle annular dark-field–scanning transmission electron
microscopy investigation indicated that the pentagonal units of both fresh Mo–V oxide and tetragonal Mo–V oxide were composed exclusively of Mo, namely, both oxides contained pentagonal
Mo6O21 units.16 These
results indicated that AH Mo–V oxide is converted
into tetragonal Mo–V oxide, in which the arrangement
of MO6 octahedra (M = Mo or V) around the pentagonal (Mo6O21)n column changes
without the collapse of the pentagonal column.

Orthorhombic
Mo–V oxide is stable under a N2 atmosphere
up to 873 K, indicating that NH Mo–V oxide (fresh Mo–V oxide calcined at 673 K under a N2 flow) is stable under a N2 flow. However, AH Mo–V
oxide (fresh Mo–V oxide calcined at 673
K in air) is converted into tetragonal Mo–V oxide under a N2 flow. Different properties, including the
valences of Mo and V and the presence or absence of V in the 6-membered
rings, may be the reason for the difference in the thermal behavior.
The catalytic activities of tetragonal Mo–V oxide for oxidation reactions are lower than those of orthorhombic Mo–V
oxide,1,2 and it is important to understand the transformation
mechanism. Although the phase transformation temperature (higher than
723 K) is higher than the usual oxidation temperature (lower than
673 K), phase transformation might be one of the deactivation pathways.
Further investigation to understand the structure transformation is
underway in our laboratory.

Conclusions
We
found that V atoms are present in 6-membered rings with partial
occupancy when orthorhombic Mo–V oxide is heated under a N2 flow, which is similar to Trunschke’s report on orthorhombic
Mo–V oxide heated under an Ar flow. On the other hand, no V
is present in the 6-membered rings when orthorhombic Mo–V oxide
is calcined in the presence of oxygen. We also reported the oxidation
states of Mo and V, the micropore volume of the 7-membered channel,
and that the thermal behavior of orthorhombic Mo–V oxide depends
on the heating atmosphere.

Orthorhombic
Mo–V oxide (fresh
Mo–V oxide) was prepared and purified according to a
reported method.11,16

Heating Treatment of Mo–V
Oxide
Fresh
Mo–V oxide (0.5 g) was placed in a muffle furnace. The
temperature was increased at 10 K/min to 673 K and then held for 2
h to afford air-heated Mo–V oxide (AH Mo–V oxide). Fresh Mo–V oxide (0.5 g) was placed in a tubular
glass furnace (inner diameter of ca. 12 mm) under a 50 mL/min N2 flow. The temperature was increased at 10 K/min to 673 K
and then held for 2 h to afford nitrogen-heated Mo–V oxide
(NH Mo–V oxide). AHMo–V
oxide was heated in a tubular glass furnace (inner diameter
of ca. 12 mm) under a 50 mL/min nitrogen flow. The temperature was
increased at a rate of 10 K/min to 848 K and held for 2 h to produce
tetragonal Mo–V oxide (tetragonal Mo–V oxide).16 Elemental analysis results are summarized
in Table 2.

X-ray
Crystallography
The single-crystal X-ray structure
analysis was performed using synchrotron radiation. Data collection
was performed using a high-precision diffractometer installed in the
SPring-8 BL40XU beamline.17,18 Synchrotron radiation
emitted from a helical undulator was monochromated by using a Si(111)
channel cut monochromator (λ = 0.83077 Å) and focused with
a Fresnel zone plate. A Rigaku Saturn 724 charge-coupled device detector
was used. The measurement was performed at 100 (2) K. Empirical absorption
correction based on Fourier series approximation was applied. The
data were corrected for Lorentz and polarization effects. The structure
was solved using direct methods and refined using the full-matrix
least-squares method (SHELXS-97 and SHELXL-2014),19,20 where unweighted and weighted agreement factors of R = ∑∥Fo| – |Fc∥/∑|Fo| (I > 2.00σ(I)) and wR =
[∑w(Fo2 – Fc2)2/∑w(Fo2)2]1/2, respectively, were used. Splitting of M8 and M9
sites along the z direction was observed. At the
beginning of refinement, metals sites (M1–M11) were refined
as mixed Mo/V sites, assuming that these sites were fully occupied
by Mo and V. All sites (M1–M6) of pentagonal Mo6O21 units11−13,16,21 were converged sufficiently close to full Mo occupancy and then
treated as Mo only sites. The clear residual electron density peak
observed in the 6-membered ring was refined as a partially occupying
V12. Some residual electron density peaks observed in the 6-membered
and 7-membered channels were assigned to the oxygen atom binding to
V12, oxygen atoms of water molecules, and nitrogen atoms of nitrogen
molecules. Nitrogen atoms of a nitrogen molecule and oxygen atoms
of water were modeled as oxygen atoms because nitrogen atoms could
not be distinguished from oxygen atoms. All oxygen atoms were refined
isotropically, and Mo and V atoms were refined anisotropically. Obtained
crystallographic data for NH Mo–V oxide are shown
in Table 4. The Mo/V
atom ratio (Mo/V = 2.56) estimated through complete elemental analysis
was slightly different from that obtained from the single-crystal
structure analysis (Mo/V = 2.71), owing to the differences between
the crystal and bulk samples. CCDC 1912347 contains the supplementary
crystallographic data for this paper. This data can be obtained free
of charge from the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre.

X-ray diffraction
(XRD) patterns were recorded with a diffractometer (RINT Ultima+,
Rigaku) using Cu Kα radiation (tube voltage, 40 kV; tube current,
40 mA). Thermogravimetric–differential thermal analysis (TG–DTA)
measurements were performed with a TG-8120 (Rigaku) thermogravimetric
analyzer. Temperature-programmed desorption (TPD)–mass spectrometry
(MS) measurements were performed with a TPD–MS apparatus (BEL
Japan). Helium was used as a carrier gas. The temperature ranged from
303 to 873 K, and a heating rate of 10 K/min was used after pretreatment
at 303 K under a He flow (50 mL/min) for 30 min. Complete elemental
analyses were carried out by Mikroanalytisches Labor Pascher (Remagen,
Germany).
