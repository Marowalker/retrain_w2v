Carbon
black nanospheres were turned to hollow carbon nanospheres
(HCNs) and were used as the conductive additive in the cathodes of
Li-ion batteries (LIBs). The results show that 10 wt % HCN added to
the LIB cathodes, such as LiMn2O4, LiCoO2, LiNiMnCoO2, and LiFePO4, can provide
significantly higher specific capacity than those using spherical
carbon black. For example, a specific capacity of the LiMn2O4/HCN/PVDF cathode at 80:10:10 wt % with a bulk electrical
conductivity of 1.07 Ω cm–2 is 125 mA h g–1 at 0.1 C from 3.0 to 4.3 V versus Li+/Li,
which is 3.85-fold higher than that using Super P. The stability tested
at 1 C remains over 95% after 800 charge/discharge cycles with 100%
Coulombic efficiency. Replacing the present carbon black conductive
additive with HCN in this work may be one of the best choices to increase
the charge storage performance of LIBs rather than only focusing on
the development of active cathode materials.

==== Body
Introduction
Li-ion batteries (LIBs)
have been widely used in many applications,
for example, mobile phones, laptops, electric vehicles, and hybrid
electric vehicles1,2 because of their high energy densities
(∼100–170 W h kg–1) and long cycle
life.3−7 The present materials used in the cathode of LIBs consist of three
main components: (i) ca. 80 wt % of active materials such as LiCoO2 (LCO), LiMn2O4 (LMO), LiNixCoyAl1–x–yO2 (NCA), LiNixMnyCo1–x–yO2 (NMC), and
LiFePO4 (LFP)8,9 and composite materials,10−12 (ii) ca. 10 wt % conductive additives (i.e., spherical carbon black,
Super P),13,14 and (iii) ca. 10 wt % polymer binders [i.e.,
polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) and poly(tetrafluoroethylene) (PTFE)].15,16

For example, LiMn2O4 having a spinel
structure
(space group Fd3m) with a poor electrical
conductivity (∼10–6 S cm–1)17 mixed with carbon black (e.g., Super
P) and PVDF at a weight ratio of 8:1:1 can provide a discharge specific
capacity of 82.6 mA h g–1 at 0.05 A g–1.18 The LiMn2O4 rods
were mixed with carbon black and PTFE (8:1:1 by weight), providing
96.8 mA h g–1 at 0.5 C.19 The LiMn2O4 nanowires (NWs) mixed with acetylene
black and PVDF at a weight ratio of 8:1:1 exhibit 94.7 mA h g–1 at 1 C.20 Up to now, about
10–20 wt % spherical carbon black (Super P) is routinely used
in the fabrication process of the LIB cathodes. However, those specific
capacities are still far lower than a theoretical value of LiMn2O4. Besides, a simple question is why spherical
carbon is extensively used as a conductive additive in LIBs.

In this work, spherical carbon black nanoparticles (CNs) were turned
to oxidized CNs (OCNs) and hollow carbon nanospheres (HCNs). They
were then used as the conductive additive in fabricating the cathodes
of LIBs. For comparison, four grades of the CN widely used, namely,
EC300J (CN-1), Super P (CN-2), Denka (CN-3), and ENSACO (CN-4), were
also employed as the conductive additives. The LIB cathodes include
LiMn2O4, LiCoO2, LiNiMnCoO2, and LiFePO4, which are currently used in the commercial
LIBs. Interestingly, we have found in this work that among carbon
conductive additives, HCN can provide rather high specific capacities
for all LIB cathodes because of its outstanding physicochemical property.
The as-fabricated coin cell LiMn2O4 battery
with a CR-2025 size using 10 wt % HCN as a conductive additive in
the cathode exhibits 125 mA h g–1 at 0.1 C, which
is 3.85-fold higher than that using the conventional conductive additive,
CN (Super P), and higher than that in other previous reports.

Results
and Discussion
Morphological and Structural Characterizations
Transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) images in Figure 1a–d show the spherical shapes of EC300J
(namely, CN-1), Super P (CN-2), Denka (CN-3), and ENSACO (CN-4), with
a diameter of around 30–50 nm in the primary spherical particles.21,22 All of them are stable in an aggregated structure, forming a so-called
high structure, leading to high electrical conductivity. Especially,
CN-1 particles aggregated have a void fraction in their particles.
Obviously, the spherical shape of the primary particles is not geometrically
ideal for entirely coating the microscale particles such as LiMn2O4, LiCoO2, LiNiMnCoO2, and
LiFePO4, which are used as the active materials of the
LIB cathodes.

(CN-1),
(b) Super P (CN-2), (c) Denka (CN-3), and (d) ENSACO (CN-4).

After the oxidation process, the
spherical shape of CN-2 was turned
to OCN with graphene multilayers, which is obviously seen in Figure 2a,b. After the reduction
process of OCN with hydrazine, the structure of HCN (Figure 2c,d) is not significantly different
when compared with that of OCN. From high-resolution transmission
electron microscopy (HR-TEM) images, the curvature graphene layers22 are clearly observed for both OCN and HCN samples
(see the inset images in Figure 2b,d). Notably, the electrical conductivity of carbon
conductive additives is due to electron delocalization in the graphene
sheets.22 The resistance of LiMn2O4/HCN/PVDF (8:1:1 wt %) measured by a four-point probe
(Jandel) is 1.07 Ω cm–2, which is lower than
1.80 Ω cm–2 of LiMn2O4/CN-2/PVDF (8:1:1 wt %) (see Table S1 and Figure S1 of Supporting Information). This result indicates
the high electrical conductivity of HCN over CN-2.

and (c) HCN as well as HR-TEM images of (b)
OCN and (d) HCN.

Raman spectra in Figure 3a display two main
peaks of D and G bands at ca. 1350 and
1587 cm–1, respectively.23,24 Theoretically, the G band is attributed to the stretching mode of
the C–C bond in a benzene ring. The D band is related to the
vibrational mode of sp3 carbon atom from the disordered
structure.25,26 The amount of disordered carbon
structures can be estimated by a peak intensity ratio between D and
G bands (ID/IG). The ID/IG values of CN-1, CN-2, CN-3, CN-4, OCN, and HCN are 1.07, 0.94, 1.00,
0.94, 1.27, and 1.10, respectively. The average lateral sizes (La) of the layer structures in the samples calculated
from Raman spectra27 ranged from 3.42 to
4.65 nm, as listed in Table 1.

and HCNs.

The functional groups of the samples characterized
by Fourier transform
infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy are shown in Figure 3b. A peak at 1724 cm–1 is
due to the stretching vibrational mode of the carboxyl group (C=O).28 The C–O stretching vibration is from
the alcoholic and carboxylic groups at ca. 1232 cm–1. The peaks at 2660 and 1620 cm–1 indicate the
C–H and C=C groups, respectively.29,30 The FTIR results here confirm that the acid oxidation process can
introduce the oxygen-containing functional groups, mainly the carboxylic
group on the OCN surface. Consequently, the oxygen-functional peaks
of HCN reduced and disappeared after the reduction process. Without
oxygen-containing groups, HCN is an ideal conductive additive, not
leading to the parasitic reactions when cycling the LIBs.

Figure 3c shows
the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the samples, exhibiting the
diffraction peaks at 2θ of ca. 25° and 44° assigned
to the (002) and (100) planes of the graphitic carbon, respectively.31,32 The average stacking heights (Lc) of
CN-1–4, OCN, and HCN calculated by the Scherrer equation are
1.39–4.53 nm, indicating the expansion of the graphitic layers
of the OCN after the acid oxidation process.

The interlayer
structures based on a (002) plane so-called d-spacing
(d002) of the samples
are 3.45–4.65 Å. These values were calculated by Bragg’s
law (see Table 1).
Overall, the crystalline structure of the HCN sample remains the graphitic
carbon and is more or less the same structure as the CN samples. The
result here indicates that the HCN retains high electronic conductivity
because of its graphitic carbon structure.

The N2 adsorption and desorption were characterized
to investigate the specific surface area and porous characteristics
of the samples (Figure 3d). The gas adsorption isotherm of the HCN sample relates to the
type IV isotherm, according to the IUPAC classification.33 The carbon black samples exhibit the mesoporous
characteristics, which are found in the range of 2–50 nm, according
to the pore size distributions (the inset image of Figure 3d). The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) equation was used to calculate the BET specific surface areas
of all samples, which are 168.16–723.47 m2 g–1, as listed in Table 1. The HCN shows higher specific surface area than that
of CN-2 (Super P), the material precursor.

Figure 4a shows
a field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) image of the
crystalline LiMn2O4 that has a hexahedron shape. Figure 4b–f shows
the morphology of the LiMn2O4 cathode mixed
with conductive additive and PVDF (80:10:10 wt % ratio) before and
after being charged/discharged for 1, 25, 50, and 100 cycles. The
results clearly illustrate that the morphology of the tested LiMn2O4 remains almost the same as that tested before.
This indicates the high stability of LiMn2O4.

cycles.

Electrochemical Property
To further understand the
electrochemical property of the HCN, the cyclic voltammograms (CVs)
of HCN and its composite with 80 wt % active material LiMn2O4 and 10 wt % polymer binder PVDF versus a standard redox
mediator (ferrocenemethanol, FcOH) with one electron-transfer reversible
process were investigated. For comparison, the CVs of LiMn2O4 and CN as well as their composites coated on glassy
carbon (GC) electrodes are also shown in Figure 5. Figure 5a shows a control experiment for which the CVs of bare
GC in 1.6 mM FcOH in 0.1 M KCl at different scan rates have a reversible
feature, indicating a reversible redox reaction of FcOH (Fe2+/3+). The CVs of bare LiMn2O4 coated on GC shown
in Figure 5b with lower
currents indicate that an insulating LiMn2O4 layer can block the redox reaction of FcOH at the GC electrode.
This is because LiMn2O4 occupies an active surface
area of GC. On the other hand, the CN layer clearly shows an adsorption
effect, preconcentrating FcOH (Fe2+) mediator, leading
to a significant enhancement in the anodic current (see Figure 5c). However, the CN layer on
the GC surface has an irreversible feature with a lower cathodic current
when compared to the anodic current. Interestingly, the HCN layer
can provide both higher anodic and cathodic currents when compared
with those of the bare GC. In addition, it has a reversible redox
reaction characteristic and high capacitive current, which is good
for the energy storage application. Also, the diffusion limit of FcOH
through the HCN layer is not so high when compared with those of other
systems. When CN and HCN were mixed with LiMn2O4 and PVDF at a ratio of 10:80:10 wt % and coated on the GC electrodes,
the CVs in Figure 5d,e clearly show that CN and HCN are great in terms of electrical
conductivity, providing a reversible redox reaction of FcOH (Fe2+/3+) and significantly enhancing both anodic and cathodic
currents when compared with those of the bare LiMn2O4-coated GC. In addition, the reversible behavior was quantitatively
measured by the ratio of the anodic/cathodic peak current (ipa/ipc), as listed
in Table 2. The GC
shows a reversible behavior with ipa/ipc equal to 1.00 at all scan rates. Also, LiMn2O4/GC has the reversible characteristics with an ipa/ipc ratio of
0.98–1.0 for different scan rates. Surprisingly, CN-2, which
is widely used as a conductive additive in commercial LIBs, and its
composite with LiMn2O4 and PVDF provide rather
high ipa/ipc values (2.2–4.2), which are very much higher than 1.0, a
theoretical value of an ideal reversible process (see Table 2). By contrast, HCN provides
desirable ipa/ipc values that are closer to 1.0. Note that a reversible process is
needed for an ideal energy storage material because it can provide
high Coulombic efficiency.

Figure 6 shows the
Nyquist plots of the samples with different rotation speed rates of
GC rotating disc electrode (RDE) from 0 to 5000 rpm. The Nyquist plot
of LiMn2O4 exhibits the highest resistance of
charge transfer because of the kinetically sluggish of the insulating material. When the conductive additives
CN and HCN were mixed with the active material, it can be clearly
observed that HCN possesses lower charge-transfer resistance. The
equivalent circuit (the inset image of Figure 6a) was used to fit the experimental data,
where Rs is the resistance in solution, Rct is the charge-transfer resistance, Cdl is the double-layer capacitance, and W is the Warburg impedance, which represents the interfacial
diffusive resistance.34 The standard heterogeneous
rate constant of electron transfer (k0, cm s–1) was calculated from eq 1. The k0 values
of all materials with different rotation rates as listed in Table 3 indicate that when
HCN was used, the rate of charge transfer was increased, which is
an ideal property for the conductive additive. 1

Charge Storage
Performance
For the charge storage capacity,
the as-fabricated LiMn2O4 electrode was electrochemically
evaluated using a galvanostatic charge/discharge (GCD) technique.
The specific capacity of the first charge/discharge profiles at 0.1
C from 3.0 to 4.3 V versus Li+/Li is shown in Figure 7a. The results indicate
that the battery using HCN as the conductive additive exhibits a specific
capacity of ca. 125 mA h g–1, which is ca. 3.85-fold
higher than those of the batteries using the pristine CN-2 (Super
P) at 0.1 C. Note that Table 4 also compares the charge storage performances of the LiMn2O4-based batteries for which the as-fabricated
battery here in this work provides significantly higher specific discharge
capacity than that in other previous reports.

Figure 7b also clearly
shows that the LiMn2O4/HCN/PVDF (8:1:1 wt %)
cathode has the highest discharge specific capacity for all applied
C rates (0.1–4 C). The stability of the as-fabricated LiMn2O4/HCN/PVDF cathode was eventually evaluated over
800 cycles at 1 C. Its capacity retention remains over 95% with a
Coulombic efficiency of 100% (see Figure 7c).

To further investigate the advantages
of using HCN as the conductive
additive in LIBs, other cathode materials of the present LIBs, such
as LiCoO2, LiNiMnCoO2, and LiFePO4, were also employed, and their charge storage performances are shown
in Figure 7d–f.
The LiCoO2 (Figure 7d), LiNiMnCoO2 (Figure 7e), and LiFePO4 (Figure 7f) batteries using HCN exhibit
significantly higher discharge specific capacities at 0.1 C when compared
with those using CN (see their charge/discharge profiles in Figure
S2 of Supporting Information). The specific
capacities of LiCoO2, LiNiMnCoO2, and LiFePO4 are ca. 106, 124, and 169 mA h g–1, respectively,
which are also higher than those in other reports. As a result, it
can be concluded here that including 10 wt % HCN to the cathodes of
the present LIBs can significantly improve the overall charge storage
performance of the cathodes of LIBs.

The Mn K-edge X-ray absorption
near-edge structure (XANES) spectra
of the LiMn2O4 cathodes before and after being
electrochemically tested by the GCD are shown in Figure 8a. The average oxidation number
of Mn in the LiMn2O4 cathode before being charged
is +3.45. The average oxidation numbers of Mn after being tested for
25, 50, and 100 cycles are close to +3.45 (see Figure 8b). This result indicates that the Li ions
intercalate/deintercalate through the LiMn2O4 structure via a reversible reaction process without a parasitic
reaction.

Conclusions
The commercial spherical CNs such as EC300J
(CN-1), Super P (CN-2),
Denka (CN-3), and ENSACO (CN-4) as well as OCN and HCN were used as
the conductive additives in the cathodes of the commercial LIBs, such
as LiMn2O4, LiCoO2, LiNiMnCoO2, and LiFePO4. For example, the as-fabricated LiMn2O4 cathode using 10 wt % HCN as the conductive
additive exhibits a specific capacity of 125 mA h g–1, which is 3.85-fold higher than that of the battery using CN at
0.1 C with a potential ranging from 3.0 to 4.3 V versus Li+/Li. The capacity retention is over 95% after 800 cycles with 100%
Coulombic efficiency at 1 C. In addition, the HCN can significantly
improve the charge storage performances of other commercially available
LIB cathodes such as LiCoO2, LiNiMnCoO2, and
LiFePO4 because of its high surface area and high ionic
conductivity. This work indicates the influence of the superior conductive
additive HCN to the charge storage performance of the LIB cathodes.
The HCN in this work may be one of the best choices to increase the
charge storage performance of LIBs for high-energy applications.

(LiPF6, Sigma-Aldrich) in the mixture of ethylene carbonate
(EC), ethyl methyl carbonate (EMC, Sigma-Aldrich), and dimethyl carbonate
(DMC, Sigma-Aldrich) (1:1:1 v/v/v) (Gelon) were of analytical grade
and used without further purification. Carbon fiber paper (CFP) (SGL
Carbon SE, Germany) was used as a current collector. Deionized water
was purified by using the Milli-Q system (>18 MΩ·cm,
Millipore).
Teflon-mounted GC electrode with 3.0 mm in diameter was from Metrohm
Siam Co., Ltd.

Synthesis of OCNs
OCN was prepared
via an oxidizing
process. Briefly, CN-2 (5 g, Super P) and HNO3 (400 mL)
were mixed together in a round-bottom flask and heated to 100 °C
for 96 h by a reflux condenser process. The obtained suspension was
washed several times with deionized water and then centrifuged at
6000 rpm for 30 min until neutral (pH 7). Afterward, OCN was collected
by a vacuum filtration process and dried at 60 °C overnight.

Synthesis of HCNs
HCN was synthesized by reducing OCN
with hydrazine. First, OCN (100 mg) was mixed with deionized water
(100 mL) and sonicated for 1 h. Then, 1 mL of 1 M hydrazine hydrate
was added into the dispersion and heated by a reflux condenser process
at 100 °C for 36 h. The suspension was centrifuged at 12 000
rpm for 30 min with deionized water (500 mL) and methanol (500 mL)
until pH 7. The product was collected after being dried at 60 °C
overnight.

Characterizations
The morphology
of the as-synthesized
samples was characterized using FE-SEM and TEM. The structural properties
were characterized using Raman spectra (Senterra dispersive Raman
microscope, Bruker) and XRD (PANalytical with Cu Kα radiation,
λ = 1.54056 Å) techniques. The functional groups on the
surfaces of the as-synthesized materials were determined by an FTIR
spectrometer (Frontier FT-IR, PerkinElmer). The surface area and porous
structures of the samples were measured by an N2 adsorption/desorption
technique (Autosorb 1 MP, Quantachrome). The BET model was used to
calculate the specific surface area of the sample.

Charge Storage
Evaluation
The cathode of the LIBs was
fabricated by mixing 80 wt % active materials, such as LiMn2O4, LiCoO2, NMC, and LiFePO4, 10
wt % conductive additives, such as CN-1, CN-2, CN-3, CN-4, OCN, and
HCN, and 10 wt % PVDF adhesive binder in an NMP solvent. The mixture
was stirred for 24 h. The as-prepared slurry was casted on the CFP
substrate with hydrophilic surface using a casting machine (GN-AFA-III,
Gelon). The as-coated CFP was vacuum-dried at 50 °C overnight,
cut into a circle (1.58 cm diameter), and used as the cathode. The
polyethylene film separator (25 μm in thickness, Gelon) was
soaked in 1 M LiPF6 in the mixture of EC, EMC, and DMC
(1:1:1 v/v/v) electrolytes. Finally, the coin cell batteries (CR-2025
size) were assembled in an argon-filled glovebox (MBraun) (<0.1
ppm H2O and O2) using a hydraulic crimping machine
(GN-110, Gelon) at 2000 psi for 5 s. The electrochemical performance
of the as-fabricated batteries was tested by a GCD technique using
a Neware battery tester (GN-4008-SCT, Gelon).
