Polymer-supported reagents have been
extensively studied and used
in various applications, such as condensation reactions and multiple
component reactions. This paper examines the reactions between a solid-functionalized
resin, named Amb15-Iso, and aldehydes and ketones that have been solubilized
in different solvents. The reactions between these molecules and a
hydrazide (isoniazid) in both neutral and acidic media were also studied.
The results showed that the solvent polarity influenced the kinetics
of the reaction and the yields of carbonyl compounds that were captured
by the resin, particularly, for less-reactive molecules. The reactions
using the resin were faster than those using free isoniazid in solution,
likely because the acidic sites remaining in the resin can catalyze
the reaction, increasing the rate of capture. A high dependence on
the presence of acidic compounds and the rate of the reaction was
observed, in which trifluoroacetic acid was used to catalyze the reaction
between the tested molecules and isoniazid in solution. The differential
reactivities of the examined ketones and aldehydes in these condensation
reactions demonstrate that the resin can provide selective criteria,
preferentially scavenging aldehydes from solution. While benzaldehyde
reacted quite quickly with the resin, acetophenone barely had any
reaction and remained in solution.

1 Introduction
Solid-phase
reactions using polymer-supported reagents have revolutionized
various areas of organic chemistry because of their easy recovery
at the end of a chemical process.1 For
example, polymer reagents have been used in industry, especially in
the pharmaceutical industry, as catalytic and stoichiometric reagents
in the synthesis of nucleotides and peptides.2−4 In these cases,
the polymers were directly involved in the reaction. Other class of
polymer reagents are for the scavenging of substances in solutions,
in which it is used after the reaction occurred for the removal of
impurities and byproducts.5−7 Over the past years, polymer-supported
reagents containing hydrazine or semicarbazide groups have been extensively
studied and used in various applications to scavenge carbonyl compounds
from solutions.8−14 To investigate the possibility of a novel and low-cost resin for
the scavenging of aldehyde and ketones, we previously investigated
the synthesis of a resin, named Amb15-Iso, which was obtained from
the reaction between a commercial acid resin (Amberlyst-15) and isoniazid
(isonicotinic acid hydrazide, CAS: 54-85-3), a drug for tuberculosis
treatment.15 Amb15-Iso is a low-cost resin
and has the ability to remove aldehydes and ketones from solutions
in a single-step reaction. Acetone and isobutyraldehyde were used
as models to study the capture of molecules by the resin. Preparations
of the Amb15-Iso resin in batch and continuous processes were also
compared, showing that the use of Amb15-Iso resin packed into a column
is advantageous for extracting carbonyl compounds from solution.16

The reaction between the Amb15-Iso resin
and carbonyl-containing
compounds involves a condensation reaction between the aldehyde/ketone
and the hydrazide group of isoniazid, which is bound to the sulfonyl
group within the resin. Scheme 1 shows the reaction between the ketone/aldehyde and the Amb15-Iso
resin.

Scheme 1 Reaction between the Amb15-Iso Resin and an Aldehyde/Ketone
during
the Scavenging Process
Condensation reactions between aldehydes and ketones and nitrogen
nucleophiles involve addition and elimination steps that proceed through
tetrahedral intermediates.19 These steps
can be either acid-catalyzed or base-catalyzed.17 The rates of these reactions are determined by the energy
and reactivity of the tetrahedral intermediates.18 For primary amines, C=N bond formation ultimately
occurs. These reactions are reversible, and the position of the overall
equilibrium depends on the nitrogen substituents and the structures
of the carbonyl compounds.17,18

This type of
reaction may also occur with hydrazines and semicarbazides,
forming hydrazones and semicarbazones (special types of imines), as
shown in Scheme 2.20 Isoniazid, the molecule used for this type of
reaction in the Amb15-Iso, is a semicarbazide.

Scheme 2 Addition–Elimination
Reactions for Aldehydes and Ketones
Although these reactions are well-understood in homogeneous media,
how the kinetics and thermodynamics of these systems change when these
reactions occur within the confined spaces of a polymeric matrix,
such as the Amb15-Iso resin, must still be evaluated. Evaluating the
effects of different solvents can provide information regarding the
application on these types of resins for the removal of aldehydes
and ketones in different media.

Therefore, the present work
aims to study the reactivity of different
aldehydes and ketones with the Amb15-Iso resin, in a batch process,
using different solvents, and to compare these reactivities to those
with free isoniazid in solution. It should be noted that the Amb15-Iso
is a model resin for the scavenging of aldehydes and ketones, and
previous results and characterizations have already been published
elsewhere. The aim of the work is solely in studying the reactivity
of the molecules with the isoniazid present in the resin, and the
evaluation on how the media (different solvents) may affect the reaction
within the confined spaces of a polymeric matrix. For this study,
a real-time technique was used: attenuated total reflectance–Fourier
transform infrared (ATR–FTIR). Using this technique, it is
possible to continuously measure the infrared spectrum of a medium
over time, for the evaluation of changes in the vibrational absorption
bands and the calculation of concentration trends for the present
species.21−25

2 Experimental Section
2.1 Apparatus
All reactions were performed
in a 100 mL reactor controlled by an EasyMax Workstation (Mettler
Toledo). The temperature of the reaction was maintained at 25 °C,
regulated with a Pt100 temperature sensor and a Peltier system jacket.
The medium was stirred at 120 rpm using a magnetic stirrer.

An infrared equipment, ReactIR 45m (Mettler Toledo), was used to
monitor the reactions in real time. It was equipped with a DS Micro
Flow Cell, with a diamond crystal as the internal reflection element
(IRE), and a mercury cadmium telluride detector, using Happ Genzel
apodization. The spectra were acquired in the range of 4000–650
cm–1, with a resolution of 8 cm–1, in intervals of 15 s between each spectrum (an average of 25 scans).
The analysis was performed on-line, where the reaction medium was
sampled from the reactor using a ProMinent Beta pump, passed through
the IR flow cell, and then returned to the reactor.

2.2 Procedure
The resin (Amb15-Iso) was
synthetized according to the procedure previously described by our
group.15 For the batch system, 40 mL of
the solvent (water) and 2 g of isoniazid were added to the reaction
vessel. The system was maintained at a constant temperature of 40
°C, at a stirring speed of 150 rpm. After the solubilization
of isoniazid, 5.0 g of Amberlyst-15 resin was added to the medium.
After completion of the reaction (60 min), the resin was drained by
vacuum filtration and washed with water and methanol. Thereafter,
the resin was dried at 60 °C for 12 h, and stored in a desiccator
to be used in the following experiments.

The performed reactions
were divided into three categories: (A) reactions between the aldehyde/ketone
and the Amb15-Iso resin; (B) reactions between the aldehyde/ketone
and the free isoniazid in solution; and (C) reactions between the
aldehyde/ketone and free isoniazid in solution catalyzed by trifluoroacetic
acid. For all of the reactions, the reagents were mixed with 40 mL
of different solvents at a temperature of 25 °C and at a stirring
rate of 120 rpm; all reactions were monitored by ATR–FTIR until
no signal variation was observed for the carbonyl band. The following
carbonyl compounds were studied: cyclohexanone, cyclohexanecarboxaldehyde,
α-ionone, and cinnamaldehyde. The following solvents were studied:
dichloromethane, hexane, acetonitrile, and ethanol.

For reactions
of type A, 100 μL of the aldehyde or ketone
was added to the solvent, prior to the addition of 5.0 g of the dry
Amb15-Iso resin; this type of reaction was also studied using a mixture
of an aldehyde (1 mmol, benzaldehyde) and a ketone (1 mmol, acetophenone),
added prior to the addition of 5.0 g of the dry Amb15-Iso resin. For
reactions of type B, 1 mmol of the aldehyde or ketone was added, prior
to the addition of 1 mmol of isoniazid. Finally, for reactions of
type C, 1 mmol of aldehyde or ketone was added with 0.1 mmol of trifluoroacetic
acid, prior to the addition of 1 mmol of isoniazid.

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Capture of Aldehydes/Ketones
by the Amb15-Iso
Resin
To evaluate the reactions, ATR–FTIR spectroscopy
was used to monitor the signal of the carbonyl absorption band of
the aldehydes and ketones. The infrared signals were generated by
the contact between the samples and the IRE of the equipment (in this
case, the ATR diamond crystal). Therefore, this type of equipment
can only be used to measure the signals of liquids, gases, and very
small solids. Because the Amb15-Iso resin is much larger than the
ATR probe tip, it was not possible to measure the carbonyl absorption
bands from the compounds present in the solid phase of the resin.
However, it was possible to measure the signal of the species present
in the liquid phase of the medium; the concentrations of these species
correlated with their signals, as defined by the Lambert–Beer
law. The analysis was performed in real time and continued until the
stabilization of the carbonyl absorption band signal occurred. Figure 1 shows the 3D graph
of part of the infrared spectra monitored over time for the cinnamaldehyde
captured by the Amb15-Iso resin.

Figure 1 Time-dependent 3D ATR–FTIR graph
of the cinnamaldehyde captured
by the reaction with Amb15-Iso resin (pure solvent spectrum subtracted),
showing the decreasing carbonyl band (I) and the increasing water
band (II) as the reaction occurs. Point A represents the addition
of the aldehyde to the solution, while point B represents the addition
of the resin to the solution.

Figure 1 shows that
following the addition of cinnamaldehyde, an absorption band appears
in a wavenumber of 1682 cm–1, related to the C=O
stretch band (point A). This band has a lower energy compared to the
usual absorption of aldehydes because of the unsaturation next to
the carbonyl. As soon as the Amb15-Iso resin was added to the solution
(point B), a decrease in this absorption intensity was observed, indicating
a decrease in the cinnamaldehyde concentration in solution, suggesting
that the molecules were leaving the liquid phase toward the interior
of the resin. At the same time, an absorption band appears in a wavenumber
of 1645 cm–1 because of the O–H bending band
of the water produced in the reaction (Scheme 1).18 Because the
intensity of the carbonyl band is related to the concentration of
the ketone or aldehyde in solution, its variation after the addition
of the resin is also related to the number of molecules that have
reacted with the resin. Monitoring this intensity over time provides
information regarding how fast this reaction occurs and enables the
calculation of how much of the aldehydes or ketones have been incorporated
into the resin.

Figure 2a shows
the carbonyl band intensity and the O–H bending band intensity
of water over time for the cinnamaldehyde reaction. As in Figure 1, point A represents
the addition of the aldehyde to the solution, and its intensity increases
until it stabilizes at a maximum value. Up until point B, no reaction
occurs, thus the experimental time is not representative of the process.
The beginning of the reaction coincides with the addition of the resin,
at point B, when the aldehyde band begins to decrease and the water
band begins to increase. Therefore, point B marks the real initial
time, t(0), which can be defined as a new zero point.

Figure 2 (a) Monitoring
cinnamaldehyde and water band intensities during
the reaction; (b) reaction conversion calculated from the cinnamaldehyde
signal, using eq 2.

The carbonyl band intensity can be directly related
to variations
in the aldehyde concentration by normalizing the signal. This normalized
concentration, c(t), is related
to the IR signal at the beginning of the reaction, I(0), as shown in eq 1 1  where I(t) is the
intensity of the carbonyl band at time t. This normalization
of the infrared signal shows how much of the
aldehyde/ketone has reacted with the Amb15-Iso resin. The time-dependent
reaction conversion can then be calculated by eq 2 2  

This conversion is shown in Figure 2b and allows the
comparison of the different systems
containing ketones and aldehydes. For the rest of this work, all of
the ATR–FTIR will be represented as reaction conversions.

To verify the effects of the different solvents on the rate of
hydrazone formation, a set of reactions were performed using the Amb15-Iso
resin and different aldehydes and ketones: cyclohexanone, cyclohexanecarboxaldehyde,
α-ionone, and cinnamaldehyde. The first and the latter two aldehydes/ketones
are structurally comparable, which allows the best understanding of
the differences among the reactions between the carbonyl compounds
in terms of different organic functions. A comparison among the four
compounds demonstrates the effect of α,β-unsaturation,
which decreases the reactivity of the compounds. The reactions were
performed in dichloromethane, hexane, methanol, and acetonitrile.
To illustrate, the results for the reactions containing cyclohexanone
are presented in Figure 3. An exponential curve was fitted to all data and is shown along
with the graphs to more directly visualize the concentration changes
over the experimental time. Results for the reactions with cyclohexanecarboxaldehyde,
α-ionone, and cinnamaldehyde are presented in the Supporting Information, while a summary of the
results obtained in different solvents is shown in Table 1.

the capture of cyclohexanone by the Amb15-Iso
resin, as measured by ATR–FTIR, in the different solvents.

Resin and Different Aldehyde and Ketones in Different Solvents

α-ionone	60/15	13/15	87/135	52/130	
cyclohexanone	51/9	23/8	79/5	44/6	
For cyclohexanone, the reaction
occurred in all of the solvents,
and the ATR–FTIR signal stopped varying at almost the same
time for all systems, meaning that the capture occurred for all four
solvents with the same equilibrium time (approximately 10 min). If
the reaction in hexane is excluded, the amount of cyclohexanone removed
from solution increased in more polar solvents: 23% in dichloromethane,
44% in acetonitrile, and 79% in ethanol. This behavior is in agreement
with the results presented in an earlier paper.15 However, if hexane is included in the discussion, the correlation
with solvent polarity disappears, which may be explained by the water
solubility of the different solvents. While water is miscible with
ethanol and acetonitrile, it has a low solubility in dichloromethane
and an even lower solubility in hexane. The water solubility in hexane
is so low that, even though hexane is a worst solvent in terms of
polarity, it induces the displacement of the reaction equilibrium
because of the separation of water from the medium, leading to a higher
conversion rate (51%).

The same study was performed with cyclohexanecarboxaldehyde,
an
aldehyde that is structurally equivalent to cyclohexanone. Similar
to cyclohexanone, a conversion was observed for its reaction with
the resin, but the amounts of captured molecules were higher than
those observed for cyclohexanone. This may be due to the fact that
aldehydes are generally much more reactive than ketones. Moreover,
in the systems using ethanol and hexane, the resin captured all of
the carbonyl compounds after 30 min, whereas in acetonitrile and dichloromethane
only approximately 84 and 93% were captured, respectively. These results
show that when the molecules are more reactive, the polarity of the
solvent does not have as large an effect on the reaction conversion
compared with molecules that are less reactive.

To further examine
the effects of molecule reactivity on the system,
carbonyl compounds with α,β-unsaturation were tested,
as this type of unsaturation should decrease the reactivity for both
types of molecules.

The Amb15-Iso resin captured α-ionone
more efficiently in
more polar solvents: 81% of the initial ketone was captured when the
reaction was conducted in ethanol (Figure 5b). However, the equilibrium time took longer
than for the other solvents, approximately 130 min. In acetonitrile,
the equilibrium time was the same as that in ethanol, but the amount
captured was lower (approximately 52%). The equilibrium times for
the systems using hexane and dichloromethane as solvents were the
same (approximately 15 min). However, a different result was found
for the capture of α-ionone in hexane (60%) than for dichloromethane
(13%), even though hexane is less polar than dichloromethane. In this
case, the reaction was more efficient in the polar solvent.

Lastly, cinnamaldehyde, as an aldehyde, is expected to be more
reactive than α-ionone. Hence, the influence of the solvent
polarity on the amount of cinnamaldehyde captured was less pronounced
than for α-ionone. For systems in which acetonitrile, dichloromethane
and hexane were used as solvents, the resin was more efficient, capturing
more than 90% of the substrate (cinnamaldehyde), whereas in ethanol
the percentage captured was approximately 81%, showing a different
effect on the solvent polarity. For the capture of cinnamaldehyde,
equilibrium was reached in ethanol after approximately 80 min, whereas
in acetonitrile, dichloromethane and hexane equilibrium was reached
after approximately 20–30 min.

The reaction behavior
with the resin varied between the aldehydes
and ketones studied. For aldehydes, the presence of an α,β-unsaturation
led to different effects of the solvent polarity because it decreases
the molecules’ reactivity. In this case, when the molecule
is more reactive (cyclohexanecarboxaldehyde), the solvent polarity
does not appear to influence either the kinetics of the reaction or
the reaction conversion. With a less-reactive functional group (cinnamaldehyde),
the solvent polarity tends to influence more the kinetics of the reaction,
in which the more polar solvent led to a slower reaction, as in the
case of the reaction using ethanol. For ketones, whose molecules are
even less reactive, the solvent polarity influences even more the
kinetics and the equilibrium. In these cases, the same behavior is
seen for the kinetics, in which more polar solvents led to slower
reactions. As for the equilibrium, the solvent polarity tends to increase
the amount of ketones captured, in which the conversion decreased
from ethanol > acetonitrile > dichloromethane. However, for
hexane,
the less polar solvent, this behavior changes because of the water
solubility, which changes the direction of the equilibrium, increasing
once again the amount of molecules captured. These results correlate
with those reported by Ciaccia and Di Stefano in their study on the
imine formation mechanisms. They proposed that the nature of a solvent
exerts a relevant influence on the rate of the reaction during the
formation of imines.19 It should be noted,
however, that the different behavior between the reaction time and
the reaction conversion is because of the fact that the two phenomena
are not correlated: one is kinetic and the other is thermodynamic.
How fast the reaction goes relates to its activation energy, and that
may vary depending on the solvents’ properties, such as the
polarity. The interaction and stabilization of intermediates may change
the overall activation energy, leading to faster kinetics. As for
the number of reacted molecules, it depends exclusively on the thermodynamics
of the system, specifically the equilibrium constant. That may also
change depending on the solvents’ properties.

To further
understand the system, an analysis was performed to
evaluate the reactivity of a mixture containing a ketone and an aldehyde
with the Amb15-Iso resin. Solutions containing benzaldehyde and acetophenone,
in ethanol and hexane, were studied using ATR–FTIR, and the
results are shown in Figure 4.

Figure 4 Normalized trends for the reaction of a mixture containing acetophenone
and benzaldehyde with the Amb15-Iso resin, as measured by ATR–FTIR,
in: (a) ethanol and (b) hexane.

For both solvents, there was a clear preference for the benzaldehyde
reaction, due to their higher reactivity. In ethanol, acetophenone
barely reacted with the Amb15-Iso resin, whereas in hexane, only approximately
10% of acetophenone reacted with the resin. Here, a kinetic effect
was the main driving force for the consumption of isoniazid with benzaldehyde
because benzaldehyde is much more reactive than acetophenone. The
same effect was not observed when using a nonpolar solvent, such as
hexane, as shown in Figure 4b.

3.2 Comparison between the
Reaction with the Free
and the Bonded Isoniazid
To better understand the reactions
of the carbonyl compounds with the resin, the reactions were also
conducted in solution, with a free hydrazine group that was not bound
to the resin matrix. The reactions were performed using the four previously
studied carbonyl compounds and isoniazid, in acetonitrile and ethanol. Figure 5a,b show a comparison between the reaction of cyclohexanone
with Amb15-Iso resin and the reaction of cyclohexanone with the free
isoniazid, both in acetonitrile and ethanol. Table 2 summarizes the results for the four molecules,
while the graphs for the other reactions are presented as Supporting Information.

Figure 5 Normalized trends, as
measured by ATR–FTIR, for the capture
of cyclohexanone by the Amb15-Iso resin in (a) ethanol and (b) acetonitrile;
and for the reaction between cyclohexanone and free isoniazid in (c)
ethanol and (d) acetonitrile.

Resin and the Different Aldehyde and Ketones and the Reactions between
Free Isoniazid and the Different Aldehydes and Ketones, in Both Ethanol
and Acetonitrile
 	conversion (%)/equilibrium time (min)	
 	Amb15-Iso	isoniazid

cyclohexanecarboxaldehyde	100/20	84/18	100/10	100/350	
α-ionone	81/100	52/130	51/330	3/110	
cyclohexanone	81/5	46/12	100/140	100/350	
When the results were compared,
the equilibrium was obtained more
quickly for the isoniazid bound to the resin than for the free isoniazid
in solution. For the cyclohexanone reaction in both ethanol and acetonitrile,
equilibrium was not achieved for more than 2 h with the free isoniazid,
whereas equilibrium was achieved in approximately 10 min with the
Amb15-Iso resin. The kinetic aspects of these results were observed
for all of the molecules and for both solvents. However, the ketones
did not react completely with the resin. For cyclohexanone, approximately
46% reacted with the resin in acetonitrile and 81% reacted in ethanol;
in contrast, the ketones reacted completely with the free isoniazid.
This behavior may be because of the fact that the Amb15-Iso resin
is formed by the reaction between the acid sites of the Amberlyst-15
resin and the pyridine ring of the isoniazid. The saturation that
was achieved for the isoniazid in the resin was 2 mEq/g resin.15 However, the capacity of the acidic sites in
the commercial Amberlyst-15 is 4.7 mEq/g. The smaller saturation concentration
of isoniazid with respect to the concentration of acidic sites in
the resin indicates that there are still free acid sites left in the
resin, as shown in Scheme 3.

Scheme 3 Reaction of the Amberlyst-15 Resin with Isoniazid
during the Synthesis
of the Amb15-Iso Resin
This excess acid in the Amb15-Iso resin may be acting as a catalyst
for the reaction between the carbonyl compounds and the hydrazide
group, making the reactions with the resin faster than those with
the free isoniazid in solution, as demonstrated by the above experiments.

To verify the presence of free acidic groups in the Amb15-Iso resin,
the pH of an aqueous medium containing pure Amberlyst-15 was compared
with the pH of an aqueous solution containing the same weight of the
Amb15-Iso resin, and results are presented in Figure 6. After the addition of Amberlyst-15, the
pH of the solution dropped from 6.05 to 3.14. The same procedure using
Amb15-Iso resin decreased the pH from 6.07 to 4.29. Because suspension
of the Amb15-Iso resin in water was acidic, this indicates that free
acidic groups are still present in the Amb15-Iso resin.

Figure 6 pH graph of
the aqueous solutions containing Amberlyst-15 and Amb15-Iso
resin.

As the formation of imines, hydrazones,
and semicarbazones can
be acid-catalyzed,18,19 the acidic sites of the Amb15-Iso
resin may catalyze the reactions with aldehydes or ketones, increasing
the rates of the reactions with the Amb15-Iso resin relative to those
with free isoniazid in solution. The Amb15-Iso resin works not only
as a nucleophilic agent for capturing aldehydes and ketones but also
as a catalyst. To demonstrate the influence of the pH on the kinetics
of the condensation of the substrate with free isoniazid in solution,
the reactions of cinnamaldehyde and α-ionone with the free isoniazid
were examined with and without the addition of trifluoroacetic acid
as the catalyst. The experiments containing the acid catalyst showed
a faster kinetics for both the ketone and the aldehyde. This suggests
the likely catalytic behavior of free acids in the Amb15-Iso resin
during the condensation reactions (Figure 7).

for the reactions
between: (a) cinnamaldehyde and isoniazid and (b) α-ionone and
isoniazid, in ethanol, with and without the trifluoroacetic acid addition.

4 Conclusions
In summary,
the effect of solvent polarity was evaluated on the
reaction between ketones/aldehydes and the Amb15-Iso resin, and the
results showed that the solvent polarity influenced the yields, especially
for less reactive molecules. When the ketones/aldehydes presented
α,β-unsaturation profiles, the solvent polarity exerted
strong influence on the yields of the reactions, without influencing
the rates of the reactions. In these cases, polar solvents tended
to result in higher yields. An exception was observed when using hexane
as a solvent because of its reduced water solubility, which changed
the equilibrium of the reactions toward the products, leading to higher
yields. Moreover, aldehydes were more reactive with the resin than
ketones, and the scavenging of a mixture between the two showed the
resin to be selective toward extracting the aldehyde. Finally, the
comparisons between the reaction of the ketones/aldehydes with the
resin and the reaction with free isoniazid showed that the latter
has slower kinetics because of the fact that the resin contains acidic
sites that catalyze the condensation reactions.
