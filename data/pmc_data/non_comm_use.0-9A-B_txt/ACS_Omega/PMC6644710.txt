The organic moiety plays an essential
role in the design of homogeneous
catalysts, where the ligands are used to tune the catalytic activity,
selectivity, and stability of the transition metal centers. The impact
of ligands on the catalytic performance of metal nanoparticle catalysts
is still less understood. Here, we prepared supported nanoparticle
(NP) catalysts by the immobilization of preformed Pd NPs on the ligand-modified
silica surfaces bearing amine, ethylenediamine, and diethylenetriamine
groups. After excluding any size effect, we were able to study the
influence of the ligands grafted on the support surface on the catalytic
activity of the supported nanoparticles. Higher activity was observed
for the Pd NPs supported on propylamine-functionalized support, whereas
the presence of ethylenediamine and diethylenetriamine groups was
detrimental to the activity. Upon the addition of excess of these
amine ligands as surface modifiers, the hydrogenation of alkene to
alkane was fully suppressed and, therefore, we were able to tune Pd
selectivity. The selective hydrogenation of alkynes into alkenes,
although a considerable challenge on the traditional palladium catalysts,
was achieved here for a range of alkynes by combining Pd NPs and amine
ligands.

Introduction
The catalytic properties
of metal nanoparticles (NPs) are generally
regarded as size- and shape-dependent;1 however, the species adsorbed on the nanoparticles’ surface
also play a crucial role in their catalytic properties.2−9 The selection of metal precursors (metal salts or organometallic
compounds), reducing agents, stabilizing agents, and solvents are
usually determined by the morphological outcome, that is, the desired
size and shape; a detailed description of the surface adsorbed species
at the molecular level is not commonly accomplished. Usually, the
stabilizing agents have to be carefully selected to avoid surface
poisoning (weakly bound ligands are preferred),10 or metal leaching under reaction conditions due to strong
affinity with the solvent; however, the choice of the organic moiety
can also reveal interesting new properties.2,3,6 More recently, attention has been given
to the electronic effects induced by surface organic modifiers (stabilizers)
on metal NP catalysts. Chen et al.3 demonstrated
that an interfacial electronic effect induced by ethylenediamine ligands
adsorbed on Pt nanowires was able to control the selectivity of metal
nanocatalysts during catalytic hydrogenation. A sulfur-containing
polymer was demonstrated to be an efficient modifier for Pd catalysts
controlling the selectivity in semihydrogenation of alkynes to alkenes.11 Other promising ligands are N-heterocyclic carbenes
(NHCs), which were studied as ligands for the stabilization of Ni
nanoparticles; more importantly, a control in the selectivity of the
metallic nanoparticles was noticed, with a good control in the stereoselectivity
to Z-alkenes in the hydrogenation of internal alkynes.12 The group of Copéret recently demonstrated
the use of phosphine ligands to control the selectivity of Cu nanoparticles
in the hydrogenation of a broad range of alkynes.13 Aiming at the control of the chemoselective hydrogenation
of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes into unsaturated alcohols,
the group of Zheng systematically studied the effect of amine-modified
Pt3Co NPs. It was experimentally and theoretically demonstrated
that the presence of long-chain amines (C12–C18) on the catalyst
surface could avoid the hydrogenation of the C=C bond, with
90% selectivity to unsaturated alcohols at 100% conversion. Theoretical
calculations showed that the long-chain amines may form an ordered
“array” on the catalyst surface to prevent the C=C
bond adsorption, thus blocking overhydrogenation.5 Alkylamine-modified Pt3Co NPs could also be
used to tune the selectivity of the metallic catalyst in the semihydrogenation
of alkynes. Density functional theory calculations demonstrated that
the adsorbed amine reduces the adsorption of alkenes, or even blocks
the surface sites that are catalytically active for overhydrogenation
of alkenes.2 Besides amines, thiols can
also be used as efficient ligands to control the selectivity of heterogeneous
catalyst.14−16 The group of Medlin has used sulfur ligands as self-assembled
monolayer on Pd surfaces, allowing a remarkable selectivity (94%)
in the hydrogenation of epoxides without significantly poisoning the
catalytic activity, when compared with the Pd catalyst without the
sulfur ligand (selectivity of 11% to the desired product). The increase
in the selectivity was attributed to the combination of steric and
electron-withdrawing effects.6 Phosphorous-modified
Pd NPs were recently investigated in the hydrogenation reactions17 and even for the challenging hydrogen peroxide
synthesis.18 Interestingly, an enhancement
in the catalytic activity in both reactions was observed in the case
of high coverage of the ligands due to the configuration of the ligand;
consequently, a lower fraction of Pd sites were poisoned. Studies
on the surface modification with a second metal, such as lead in Lindlar
catalyst,19 or to create strong metal–support
interactions are among the most common strategies used to tune the
electronic structure of heterogeneous catalysts. Understanding the
electronic effect induced by organic modifiers may lead to an effective,
greener, and low-cost approach to optimize the catalytic performance
of heterogeneous catalysts.

The functionalization (organic
modification) of the support, which usually precedes the incorporation
of the active metal phase, has become a common step in the preparation
of supported metal nanoparticle catalysts. Examples include those
where the metal nanoparticles were prepared by impregnation–reduction
and those where the metal nanoparticles were prepared first and then
immobilized on the support (sol immobilization method).20,21 In the first example, the metal nanoparticles grow under the influence
of the ligands grafted on the support and particle’s size can
be affected. In the latter example, the particle’s size was
defined before immobilization and usually does not change during the
immobilization process. The present study has been carried out with
the supported Pd NP catalysts prepared by the immobilization of preformed
Pd NPs (poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA)-stabilized Pd NPs) on ligand-modified
silica surfaces; that is, no size effect. In a previous study, where
the supported Pd NP catalysts were prepared by the impregnation of
Pd2+ ions on the ligand-modified silica surfaces and then
reduction into Pd NPs, different particle sizes were obtained.22 The strategy of using silica functionalized
with amine groups for the impregnation of metal precursors and then
reduction into metal NPs has been reported, and the main advantages
include improved metal precursor impregnation rates, improved metal–support
interaction, absence of metal leaching into the liquid phase and control
on metal dispersion and particle growth.23−26 The amount of metal ions (Rh(III),
Pt(II), and Ir(III)) loaded on the support was always higher on the
functionalized silica by at least 10 times the amount loaded on the
nonfunctionalized silica.27 The metal leaching
into the liquid phase (even with polar substrates) was suppressed
in the catalyst prepared with the amine-functionalized silica, whereas
it remains a problem in the catalyst prepared with the nonfunctionalized
silica. During the preparation of supported metal NPs by the impregnation
of metal ions and then the reduction using functionalized solid supports,
we can expect the coordination of the metal ions to the ligands grafted
on the support surface, and consequently an influence in the reduction
step and particles’ growth process. A very simple strategy
of grafting different functional groups on silica surfaces was used
to shed some light on the influence of ligands on the particles’
size. Silica surfaces were functionalized with amine and ethylenediamine
groups by reaction with organoalkoxysilanes and then impregnated with
the same amount of Pd2+ ions. After metal reduction with
hydrogen under mild conditions, supported palladium NPs of 6.4 and
1 nm were obtained, respectively.22 The
strong influence of different ligands on the size of the NPs formed
has to be related to the interaction between the metal ions and the
ligands grafted on the support and how the metal ions are made available
to participate in the nanoparticles’ growth. The supported
Pd NPs also exhibited very distinct catalytic properties in the hydrogenation
of cyclohexene to cyclohexane with the turnover frequencies (TOFs)
of 800 and 5500 h–1, respectively, considering the
total amount of metal. If one considers metal dispersion, the difference
in TOFs will be even larger. It seems that the smaller NPs (ca. 1
nm) are less active and less suitable to catalyze the hydrogenation
reaction than the larger NPs (ca. 6 nm); however, the influence of
different ligands on catalytic activities was not possible to evaluate.
Aminopolymer–silica composites were studied by Long et al.26 and proved to be excellent ligands in the selective
hydrogenation of alkynes using palladium-based catalysts, offering
high reaction rates and selectivity; moreover, these ligands promote
the control of dispersion of Pd NPs. To better study the influence of ligands grafted on the support
on the catalytic properties, we prepared a new series of supported
Pd NP catalysts by the immobilization of preformed PVA-stabilized
Pd NPs on the silica surfaces functionalized with amine, ethylenediamine,
and diethylenetriamine groups. The supported Pd(0) nanoparticles having
the same size allowed us to study the influence of the ligands grafted
on the support surfaces on the catalytic activity. We then extended
our studies on the influence of this family of amine ligands on the
semihydrogenation of alkynes. The selective semihydrogenation of alkynes
into alkenes is a considerable challenge on traditional palladium
catalysts,28,29 but, in this work, it was achieved
over a range of alkynes through the organic modification of the catalyst
surfaces, which selectively suppressed the alkene-to-alkane reaction.

Results
and Discussion
The catalyst support consists of silica-coated
magnetic nanoparticles
(FFSi, ∼30–50 nm) prepared following a microemulsion
procedure described by us.23 The Pd catalysts
were prepared by a coordination capture method using presynthesized
PVA-stabilized Pd NPs and ligand-modified supports. The support surfaces
were functionalized with organosilane reagents (3-aminopropyl)triethoxysilane,
[3-(2-aminoethyl)aminopropyl]-trimethoxysilane, and 2-[2-(3-trimethoxysilylpropylamino)ethylamino]ethylamine
were used to prepare amino (FFSiNH2), ethylenediamino (FFSien),
and diethylenetriamino (FFSiden) functionalized solids. The amount
of nitrogen in each solid, determined by the elemental analysis, was
0.64, 1.55, and 2.10 wt % for FFSiNH2, FFSien, and FFSiden,
respectively. The catalysts were prepared by adding the ligand-modified
silica supports to the aqueous solutions containing the colloidal
Pd NPs. The size and size distribution of the PVA-stabilized Pd NPs
were determined by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), before
the immobilization process, as 3.0 ± 1.1 nm (Figure 1a,b). No significant change
in the size of Pd NPs was observed after immobilization on FFSiNH2, FFSien, and FFSiden (Figure 2). The metal loading on the solids, determined by flame
atomic absorption spectroscopy (FAAS), was ca. 1.4 wt % (or 0.11 mmol
Pd per gram of solid) for FFSiNH2Pd and ca. 1.6 wt % for
FFSienPd and FFSidenPd (or 0.15 mmol Pd per gram of solid).

The catalytic hydrogenation
of cyclohexene was performed under
the conditions reported elsewhere (H2 gas at 6 bar (constant)
and 75 °C)22 and the reaction progress
was followed by the consumption of H2 until total consumption
of the substrate (Figure 3a). Clearly, the Pd NPs supported on the silica surfaces functionalized
with amine (NH2), ethylenediamine (en), and diethylenetriamine
(den) groups catalyze the hydrogenation of cyclohexene to cyclohexane
at quite different reaction rates. The complete conversion of a fixed
amount of substrate (17.5 mmol) at 2500 mol/mol substrate-to-catalyst
ratio lasted ca. 180 min (FFSidenPd), 90 min (FFSienPd), and 36 min
(FFSiNH2Pd) and the initial turnover frequencies were 2100,
2400, and 4700 h–1, respectively (Figure 3a, solid symbols). Therefore,
the catalytic activity of the freshly prepared catalysts follows the
order FFSiNH2Pd ≫ FFSienPd > FFSidenPd. As the
catalysts
were prepared using presynthesized PVA-stabilized Pd NPs and retain
the same particle size after immobilization (Figure 2), we can attribute the differences in catalytic
activity to an effect of the organic moiety present on the support
surface. To remove the ligands from the catalysts’ surface,
the catalysts were thermally treated at 400 °C for 2 h. Unfortunately,
this process leads to a significant increase in particle size for
all of the catalysts (SI, Figure S1). The
FFSienPd and FFSidenPd catalysts became more active after calcination,
whereas FFSiNH2Pd maintained its catalytic activity (Figure 3a, open symbols).
The initial turnover frequencies (expressed as mole of substrate converted
per mole of metal per hour) reached 5000 (FFSiNH2Pd), 5330
(FFSienPd), and 4240 h–1 (FFSidenPd). An increase
in activity was not expected after an increase in the particle size
(decrease of surface-to-volume ratio), a process that leads to the
deactivation of heterogeneous catalysts,30 suggesting that the removal of ligands has a beneficial effect on
the catalytic reaction rates.

Figure 3 (a) Cyclohexene hydrogenation curves, (b) successive
hydrogenations
of cyclohexene by freshly prepared Pd catalysts, (c) successive hydrogenations
of cyclohexene after ligand removal by calcination, (d) catalyst magnetic
separation. Reaction conditions: 17.5 mmol cyclohexene, 50 mg supported
catalyst (0.007 mmol Pd) (2500 mol substrate per mol catalyst), 75
°C, and 6 bar H2.

Further experiments were performed to verify the stability
of Pd
NPs and the effect of ligands by recycling the magnetically recoverable
catalyst in the successive hydrogenation reactions (Figure 3b–d). The as-prepared
catalysts were reused in 10 successive runs of 2500 turnovers each
(total turnovers of 25 000) by adding new portions of cyclohexene
to the magnetically recovered solid (Figure 3b). The FFSiNH2Pd catalyst increased
its catalytic activity in the recycling test, showing TOF as high
as 8000 h–1, with no sign of deactivation. The FFSienPd
and FFSidenPd catalysts were, in general, less active from the 1st to the 10th recycle, but FFSidenPd deactivates
more than FFSienPd after the 6th recycle. The deactivation
process cannot be attributed to metal leaching because negligible
amounts of metal were found in the organic products collected from
the catalyst recycling experiments (<0.01 ppm Pd by inductively
coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy analysis). Interestingly,
the calcined catalysts (400 °C, 2 h) were, in general, more active
in successive catalytic hydrogenation experiments; the FFSiNH2Pd and FFSidenPd catalysts reproduced similar catalytic performance
up to 10th recycles and the FFSienPd catalyst restructured
into a more active catalyst upon recycling (Figure 3c). It is worth noticing that besides the
metal sintering after the thermal treatment, there is a systematic
gain in activity after ligand removal.

To study the ligand poisoning
effect, we added different quantities
of ethylenediamine (molar equivalents with respect to the amount of
metal used in the reaction) to the reaction mixture and ran the hydrogenation
of cyclohexene under similar reaction conditions with the calcined
FFSienPd catalyst (Figure 4). Figure 4 Catalytic activity of calcined FFSienPd catalyst after the addition
of ethylenediamine during a typical cyclohexene hydrogenation. Reaction
conditions: 17.5 mmol cyclohexene, 50 mg supported catalyst (0.007
mmol Pd) (2500 mol substrate per mol catalyst), 0–0.07 mmol
ethylenediamine (0–10 equiv with respect to palladium), 75
°C, and 6 bar H2.

The addition of increasing amounts of ethylenediamine caused
a decrease in the catalytic activity, which suggests a surface poisoning
effect. However, some control experiments were performed to exclude
any activity related to the leaching of molecular species. The complete
loss of activity occurs through the addition of 2 equiv of ethylenediamine,
thus the complex [Pd(en)2]Cl2 was tested under
the same experimental conditions. The complex [Pd(en)2]Cl2 did not exhibit any activity even after 24 h of reaction.
Colloidal PVP-stabilized Pd NPs (dispersible in the reaction media),
which were active for the cyclohexene hydrogenation reaction,
lose activity after adding 2 equiv of ethylenediamine. These results
refute the hypothesis of Pd leaching and formation of molecular active
species. Ethylenediamine most likely participates in a poisoning process
on the surface of the Pd NPs, blocking some of the catalytic sites
where the reaction takes place. The fact that the poisoning does not
obey a substoichiometric relationship with metal can be the result
of the weak interaction of amine ligands with metal.31 As previously described for Pt NPs,2 at sufficiently high concentrations of amine ligands, there is a
change in the adsorption energies, and the amine adsorption is favored
in detriment of alkene adsorption on the metallic surface. The unfavorable
adsorption of the C=C bond leads to a decrease in the alkene
hydrogenation rate.

We next focus our attention to examine the
influence of the ligand-modified
supports on the selectivity of the FFSiNH2Pd, FFSienPd,
and FFSidenPd catalysts. The catalytic semihydrogenation of alkynes
is of great importance in the polymer and fine chemical industries32−34 and is usually accomplished using ligand- and/or metal-modified
Pd catalysts.17,35−37 The Pd NPs
under the influence of the ligands grafted on the support exhibited
different activities for the hydrogenation of diphenylacetylene 1a (FFSiNH2Pd ≫ FFSienPd > FFSidenPd;
similar
trend as for hydrogenation of cyclohexene). The alkene 2a was formed as an intermediate, but the interaction with the ligands
did not avoid the successive reduction into the corresponding alkane 4a (Figure 5a–c).

Figure 5 Time-course hydrogenation of diphenylacetylene catalyzed
by (a)
FFSiNH2Pd, (b) FFSienPd, and (c) FFSidenPd. Reaction conditions:
7 mmol 1,2-diphenylacetylene, 50 mg supported catalyst (0.007 mmol
Pd) (1000 mol substrate per mol catalyst), 75 °C, and 6 bar H2.

To avoid the undesired overhydrogenation
of the alkene, we tested
the effect of adding ethylenediamine and diethylenetriamine to the
reaction mixture containing the Pd catalysts. Different from the results
obtained with cyclohexene (Figure 4), the addition of 10 equiv of ethylenediamine to the
FFSienPd catalyst did not suppress the hydrogenation of diphenylacetylene 1a (Table 1, entry 1) into the reduced product 4a. It is worth
noting that an increase in the amount of ethylenediamine did not deactivate
the catalysts for the alkyne conversion, but resulted in a gain in
selectivity toward alkenes 2a and 3a (Table 1, entries 3–8).
Interestingly, high yield of alkenes (90%) was achieved even after
12 h of reaction (Table 1, entry 8). In contrast, when adding diethylenetriamine to the FFSidenPd
catalyst, less excess of amine was necessary to suppress the formation
of the hydrogenated product 4a (Table 1, entries 9–15). The reaction profile
over time for the hydrogenation of diphenylacetylene in the presence
of excess of ethylenediamine (Figure 6a) or diethylenetriamine (Figure 6b) shows that the ligands block almost completely
the overhydrogenation of the alkene to alkane even at long reaction
times after the full conversion of the alkyne. Similar behavior was
observed when using the calcined catalysts (SI, Table S1), although further increase in the amount of added
amine was necessary to suppress the formation of the alkane in the
long reaction time (SI, Figure S3). These
results are in agreement with those of the previous reports on the
use of ligands to control the nanoparticle catalyst selectivity.5,17,37,38 The role of the amine ligands is to compete with alkene adsorption,
as previously described for the platinum system,2 preventing its hydrogenation; however, the alkyne adsorption
is still more favorable than the amine ligand, allowing the alkyne-to-alkene
reaction to occur. Moreover, electronic effects due to the donation
of the lone pair of nitrogen atoms from amine to Pd NPs also may affect
the selectivity,3 but we were not able
to determine the extent to which this effect contributes to the catalytic
performance.

With the best conditions in hands (EtOH as the solvent

with 6 bar of H2 and 23 mmol of den), we explored the substrate
scope for the alkynes hydrogenation. The catalytic system was able
to control the selectivity of palladium; aromatic and aliphatic internal
and terminal alkynes were converted into the corresponding alkenes
in over 75% yields (Table 2), without the isomerization into internal alkenes in the
case of terminal alkenes. Sensitive and reducible functional groups
such as alcohols, ether, and alkene moieties were well tolerated in
the alkyne hydrogenation process (Table 2, entries 3, 4, 6, 7, and 13). Even after
long reaction times (Table 2, entries 2, 8, and 12), good selectivity to the alkenes was
obtained.

Conclusions
In summary, the ligand-assisted method
for the preparation of supported
metal nanoparticles offers a versatile and convenient approach to
obtain catalysts with a strong metal–support interaction, which
result in (1) higher loading when compared with nonmodified silica,
(2) negligible metal leaching, and (3) higher stability upon recycling.
However, the ligands grafted on the silica surfaces influence the
catalytic activity of supported PVA-stabilized Pd(0) NPs and have
to be carefully selected. Those ligands that are detrimental to the
catalytic activity can be removed by the thermal treatment to recover
activity. The addition of excess of these ligands to supported Pd
NPs suppressed the alkene-to-alkane reaction and therefore was used
as a strategy to tune the selectivity of Pd in the semihydrogenation
of alkyne to alkene. Although we demonstrated the successful utilization
of ligand modifiers in combination with metal nanoparticles, much
is yet unknown about their role in the reaction mechanism.

Experimental
Section
All of the reagents used for the support and catalyst
preparation
were of analytical grade, purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, and used as
received. Alkynes, amines, and standards for GC analysis, all purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich, were of highest grade available and used as received.
Palladium content in the catalyst was measured by the FAAS analysis
on a Shimadzu AA-6300 spectrophotometer using a Pd hollow cathode
lamp (Photron). TEM and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy
(HRTEM) analyses were performed with a JEOL 2100 instrument with the
sample placed on a carbon-coated copper grid (Ted Pella, Inc.).

The catalysts support, silica-coated magnetic nanoparticles (FFSi),
was prepared following the procedure described by Jacinto el al.23 and functionalized with (3-aminopropyl)triethoxysilane,
[3-(2-aminoethyl)aminopropyl]-trimethoxysilane and 2-[2-(3-trimethoxysilylpropylamino)ethylamino]ethylamine
to prepare amino (FFSi–NH2), ethylenediamino (FFSi–en),
and diethylenetriamino (FFSi–den), respectively. The support
(1 g) was added to 200 mL of a solution containing the ligand in toluene
(1% v/v silane/toluene). The dispersion was magnetically stirred for
2 h. The solid was magnetically separated and washed with toluene
(1 × 50 mL) and acetone (1 × 20 mL). The obtained solids
were dried in oven at 80 °C for 20 h.

The Pd NPs were previously
synthesized by a colloidal method.21 For
obtaining a solid containing ca. 1.5 wt
% Pd, a 200 mL aqueous solution of palladium(II) chloride 1.2 mmol
L–1 was prepared. The Pd(II) solution was prepared
by the addition of 25 mg of palladium chloride (0.24 mmol) and 28
mg of sodium chloride (0.48 mmol) to 200 mL of distilled water, and
the solution was heated under stirring until total dissolution of
the palladium salt. After the complete dissolution, 2.25 mL of solution
of 1 wt % hydrolyzed poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA, MW = 9000–10 000
g mol–1) was added under stirring to the metal solution.
Then, 7 mL of a solution of 0.1 mol L–1 of NaBH4 was added dropwise and stirred for 30 min. To the resulting
solution, 1 g of functionalized support was added and the solution
was stirred for 2 h. The solid was then separated magnetically and
washed with hot water (∼60 °C, 3 × 10 mL), isolated
as a powder, and labeled FFSiLPd (L = −NH2, −en,
−den). A portion of the obtained solid was thermally treated
(TT) at 400 °C for 2 h in air atmosphere. The catalyst obtained
after the calcination process was named as FFSiLPd-TT.

The catalytic
reactions were carried out in a modified Fischer–Porter
glass reactor connected to a pressurized hydrogen reservoir tank.
In a typical experiment, the catalyst precursor and substrate (palladium/substrate
molar ratio 1/2500 in the case of cyclohexene and 1/1000 for alkyne
hydrogenation) were added to a modified Fisher–Porter glass
reactor. The reactor was purged five times with H2, loaded
with 6 bar of H2, and placed in an oil bath at 75 °C
under stirring. The required working pressure was maintained constant
for the entire course of the reaction by leaving the Fischer–Porter
reactor open to the hydrogen supply. Hydrogen pressure was monitored
with a pressure transducer interfaced to a computer through a Novus
Field Logger converter. The data (pressure vs time) were collected
by the FieldChart Novus Software and subsequently treated to plot
the hydrogenation curves. For reuse tests, the catalyst was recovered
magnetically by placing a magnet in the reactor wall and the products
were collected with a syringe and analyzed by gas chromatography (GC).
The recovered catalyst (without any further treatment) was reused
under identical reaction conditions by adding to the reactor a new
amount of substrate. GC analyses were performed in a Shimadzu GC-2010
equipped with a RTx-Wax column (30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 mm)
and a FID detector. Method: Ti = 40 °C, Tf = 200 °C, 25 min, T FID and SPLIT = 200
°C. Internal standard: biphenyl. The conversion and selectivity
were determined from the total amount of detected products and reactant.39
