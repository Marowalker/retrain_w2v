Lignin powder was
modified via ring-opening polymerization of caprolactone
to form a lignin–polycaprolactone (LPCL) particulate. The LPCL
particulates were mixed with an acrylonitrile–butadiene–styrene
(ABS) matrix at an extremely high rotational speed of up to 3000 rpm,
which was achieved by a closed-loop screw mixer and in-line melt extruder.
Using this high-shear extruding mixer, the LPCL particulate size was
controlled in the range of 3395 nm (conventional twin-screw extrusion)
down to 638 nm (high-shear mixer of 3000 rpm) by altering the mixing
speed and time. The resulting LPCL/ABS composites clearly showed non-Einstein
viscosity phenomena, exhibiting reduced viscosity (2130 Pa·s)
compared to the general extruded composite one (4270 Pa·s) at
1 s–1 and 210 °C. This is due to the conformational
rearrangement and the increased free volume of ABS molecular chains
in the vicinity of LPCL particulates. This was supported by the decreased
glass transition temperature (Tg, 83.7
°C) of the LPCL/ABS composite specimens, for example, giving
a 21.8% decrement compared to that (107 °C) of the neat ABS by
the incorporation of 10 wt % LPCL particulates in ABS. The LPCL particulate
morphology, damping characteristics, and light transmittance of the
developed composites were thoroughly investigated at various levels
of applied shear rates and mixing conditions. The non-Einstein rheological
phenomena stemming from the incorporation of LPCL particulates suggest
an interesting plasticization methodology: to improve the processability
of high-loading filler/polymer composites and ultra-high molecular
weight polymers that are difficult to process because of their high
viscosity.

Introduction
As the severity of
environmental pollution by petrochemical products
increases, interest in novel materials derived from renewable resources
as polymer (or polymer composite) materials is increasing.1 Lignin, which is the second most abundant polymer
after cellulose, possesses many attractive properties such as biodegradability,
abundance, antioxidant property, and non-food-based feedstock, making
it an ideal candidate for developing value-added products for various
applications.2,3 In addition, it is known as a
natural broad-spectrum UV blocker because of the presence of phenolics,
ketones, and other chromophores.4 Lignin,
which is mainly used as an additive or filler in the polymer composite,
can be applied in various forms such as kraft lignin and lignosulfonate,
or in combination with other materials including cellulose, inorganic
substance, and so forth.5,6 However, there is a
limit to the use of raw lignin as a polymeric material. Natural lignin
tends to aggregate because of the π–π stacking
of aromatic rings, van der Waals attraction of chains, and strong
hydrogen bonding between lignin molecules and has a problem of poor
compatibility with other polymers.7 The
surface characteristics of lignin powder may be altered by adopting
freely moving molecular chains that could change the rheological properties
and compatibility with matrix polymers. In this sense, we have reported
that the esterification of lignin via ring-opening polymerization
(ROP) of ε-caprolactone (as a reactive solvent with biodegradability,
low activation energy) not only lowers the agglomeration through hydroxyl
substitution of lignin but also improves the processability and compatibility
with other polymers.8−10

When fillers (or particles) are incorporated
in a polymer melt
(or liquid), they usually act as obstacles impeding the flow and increasing
the viscosity of the polymer melt. A simple model suggested by Einstein
to describe the increased viscosity (η) is as follows 1  where ηo is the viscosity
of the dispersion medium and φ is the volume fraction of the
dispersed particle.11,12 However, it has recently been
reported that the assembly of filler particles dispersed in the polymer
matrix can lower the melt viscosity, which contradicts the expression
derived from Einstein. Specifically, the decrease of composite viscosity
occurs when the mean interparticle half-distance (h) is smaller than the radius of gyration (Rg) and the molecular weight of the polymer is larger than the
entanglement molecular weight13,14 2  where φm is the
maximum random
packing volume fraction (∼0.638 for monodispersed spherical
particles) and φ is the volume fraction of nanoparticles. This
decrease in the melt viscosity of the polymer–filler composite
can be explained by dilution of the entanglement density of the polymer
chains, increase in the free volume induced around the filler molecules,
and decomposition of the polymer.15 However,
it should be noted that until now, only well-dispersed spherical nanoparticles
have caused viscosity reduction,16 that
is, the viscosity reduction of composites to which nonspherical particles
are applied must be accompanied by more innovative process conditions.
The recently developed high-shear extruder used in this study can
induce improved dispersibility of the composite and decrease of the
aggregation size through applied shear stress.17 This can be expected to reduce the viscosity of the composite
by reducing the chain entanglement of the polymer used as a matrix
material and increasing the free volume induced around the well-dispersed
filler. In general, the viscosity reduction of composites is considered
to be very important because it leads to improved processability and
productivity in composite manufacturing industries.18

Acrylonitrile–butadiene–styrene (ABS)
is an engineering
thermoplastic resin that is generally known for its excellent mechanical
performance, chemical resistance, fine surface appearance, and easy
processing characteristics.19 ABS, which
is a terpolymer made up of acrylonitrile, butadiene, and styrene,
is a long chain of polybutadiene crossed with shorter chains of poly(styrene-co-acrylonitrile). ABS is widely used for tough products,
such as structural components in automotive and consumer products,
pipes, and housing of electronic and electrical devices because its
property-price profile is intermediate between inexpensive thermoplastic
and high-performance engineering plastics.20 However, one critical drawback of ABS is its poor UV resistance,
which is caused by the butadiene component. When ABS is used in outdoor
applications, the C=C bonds in butadiene easily undergo chemical
aging under the condition of UV radiation and oxygen.21 To overcome this disadvantage, poly(acrylonitrile–styrene–acrylic)
resin (in which butadiene has been replaced with acrylic to have no
double bond in the main chain) may be used as an alternative, but
UV stabilizers are generally added to the ABS resin.22 Especially, lignin can be used as an excellent UV stabilizer
because it is known as a natural broad-spectrum UV blocker because
of the presence of phenolics, ketones, and other chromophores.4,7

In the current research, we synthesized the lignin–polycaprolactone
(LPCL) particulate via ROP of caprolactone with lignin. The eco-friendly
ABS composite containing the LPCL particulate as a biomass-based UV
stabilizer was fabricated through a twin-screw extruder and high-shear
extruder. The high-shear processing equipment was used to control
the particulate size and improve the dispersibility of the lignin-based
polymer in the ABS matrix. We optically investigated the dispersity
of the LPCL particulate in the ABS matrix and thoroughly analyzed
the thermal and rheological properties of the fabricated eco-friendly
composites.

Experimental Methods
Materials
ABS (HI121H) was purchased
from LG. Chem.
Co. Ltd., Korea. It was of general-purpose injection molding grade
with a melt flow index of 23 g/10 min at 220 °C/10 kg load, as
per ASTM D1238. Soft kraft lignin (the content of lignin and ash was
about 97.1 and 1.6 wt %) was supplied by the Domtar Corporation (North
Carolina, U.S.A). According to the manufacturer, it was brown fine
powder (elemental composition (wt % dry basis): carbon = 62.8, hydrogen
= 5.0, oxygen = 28.1, sulfur = 3.6) with a bulk density of 348 kg/m3, number-average molecular weight (Mn) of 913 g/mol, weight-average molecular weight (Mw) of 1323 g/mol, and polydispersity of 1.45. ε-Caprolactone
(CL), dibutyltin dilaurate (DBTDL), acetic acid, and tetrahydrofuran
(THF) were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. Two thermal antioxidants,
SONGNOX 1010 (phenolic-based, Songwon) and SONGNOX 1680 (phosphite-based,
Songwon) were used for composite preparation. All reagents were used
without further purification.

Synthesis of LPCL Copolymer
Particulate8
The dried lignin
powder (100 g) was mixed with ε-caprolactone
(100 g). The mixture was stirred for 30 min at 1200 rpm, 90 °C
by the twin-screw kneader under the nitrogen atmosphere. After increasing
the temperature to 150 °C, DBTDL was added as a catalyst to the
lignin and ε-caprolactone mixture. The LPCL copolymer was synthesized
via ROP for 4 h and then cooled to room temperature (RT). LPCL was
dried in a vacuum oven at RT overnight before use. More detailed information
can be found in ref (8).

Fabrication of LPCL/ABS Composite
ABS, as a polymer
matrix, was dried using a laboratory convection oven at 60 °C
overnight before use, to remove the residual water. LPCL/ABS composites
with 10 wt % LPCL contents were melt-compounded using a twin-screw
extruder (L/D ratio of 40, BA-19, BauTech, Korea). The temperature
of the barrel was set to 150–220 °C, and the screw speed
was 200 rpm. The extruded pellets of the LPCL/ABS composite were dried
in an oven at 60 °C overnight.

In another way, high-shear
processing was performed using an NHSS2-28 high-shear extruder (Niigata
Machine Techno Co., Ltd., Japan), which consists of a plasticization
section and a high-shear section in a separate arrangement, as shown
in Figure 1A. The plasticization
section keeps the material in a plasticized state suitable for high-shear
processing and injects constant amount into the high-shear part. In
the high-shear section, the injected material is processed at a controlled
rotation speed and time with an internal feedback type screw (Figure 1B).17 In order to observe the variation of the size and dispersion
state of LPCL particulates (which are easily aggregated by strong
hydrogen bonding) in the ABS matrix through high-shear processing,
various shear stress conditions were tested as follows. The rotation
speed of the screw used in current research was set to be 500, 1500,
and 3000 rpm, and the processing time was 10, 30, and 60 s. The temperature
of the barrel in the plasticization section was set to 135–205
°C, while that of the high-shear section was 200–220 °C.
The compounded samples were then extruded from a filament-die. For
the property measurements, the processed samples were hot-pressed
at 190 °C to a film with a thickness of 80 μm.

machine and (B) the flow route of the injected material during mixing

Characterization
The infrared spectra of lignin and
LPCL were obtained using Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy
(IFS-66/S, Bruker, USA). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM, S-2400,
Hitachi, Japan) was used to observe the morphology of the LPCL/ABS
composites with an accelerating voltage of 18 kV. The samples were
sputter-coated with gold using a sputter coater (E-1010, Hitachi,
Japan). Optical properties were measured using an ultraviolet–visible/near-infrared
spectrometer (UV–VIS/NIR, Varian Cary 5000, Agilent, USA) and
an optical microscope (Nikon Eclipse Ni-E). The agglomeration size
of the composite was conducted by a Zetasizer (Nano ZS, Malvern Instruments
Ltd., UK). The Z-average mean was calculated from
DTS Nano version 7.12, supplied by the manufacturer (Malvern Instruments
Ltd.). Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA, TG/DTA 7300, Seiko Inst.,
Japan) was conducted in a nitrogen atmosphere from ambient temperature
to 600 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C/min. Gel permeation
chromatography (GPC, Agilent 1100S, Agilent, USA) was used to measure
the molecular weights of ABS before and after high-shear processing.
The column set was calibrated using monodispersed poly(methyl methacrylate)
(PMMA) standards in the THF solvent. The thermal transitions of the
composites were analyzed using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC,
DSC 7020, Seiko Inst., Japan) and a thermal mechanical analyzer (TMA,
TMA6100, Seiko Inst., Japan). Dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA, DMA/SS6100,
Seiko Inst., Japan) was carried out in the tension mode at a frequency
of 1 Hz with a 5 μm amplitude under the heating rate of 3 °C/min
up to 150 °C. The DMA samples were prepared at the size of 10
mm wide, 50 mm long, and 80 μm thick. The rheological characteristics
were studied using a rotational rheometer (MCR 102, Anton Paar, Germany).
The measurement was conducted in a parallel plate geometry with a
diameter of 25 mm at 210 °C and was performed at strain rates
ranging from 0.01 to 1 s–1. For the rheological
test, the analytical specimens were manufactured using an injection
molding machine (clamping force 45 ton, Engel, Germany) operating
at an injection temperature of 210 °C and a mold temperature
of 40 °C according to the ASTM standard.

Results and Discussion
Synthesis
of Lignin-Based Polymer
Figure 2A shows that the lignin-based
polymer is synthesized by the ROP of ε-caprolactone with the
hydroxyl groups in lignin molecules, where the DBTDL acts as the initiating
agent for the ring opening reaction of ε-caprolactone monomers.

and (D) TGA thermograms of the pristine lignin and lignin-based polymer.

The characterization and analysis
of the synthesized lignin polymer
are estimated via FT-IR, DSC, and TGA. As can be seen in Figure 2B, several aspects
indicate PCL grafting on the lignin. Important finger-print peaks
observed in the lignin polymer spectrum were an increased intensity
of the peak at 2864 cm–1 (C–H stretching),
1726 cm–1 (C=O ester), and 1191 cm–1 (C–O stretching) associated with an ester linkage between
lignin and caprolactone.23Figure 2C shows the DSC results of
the pristine lignin and lignin polymer. An endothermic peak observed
at 43.76 °C is attributed to the melting of the PCL crystalline
region in the lignin polymer. In the case of lignin, it is difficult
to confirm the glass transition temperature because of the strong
hydrogen bonding between the lignin molecules, but Tg of the lignin polymer is observed at 171.96 °C.
This indicates that the intermolecular hydrogen bonding of lignin
was disrupted because the OH groups of lignin were converted into
the PCL chain.24Figure 2D shows that the thermal stability of the
lignin polymer is improved compared to the pristine lignin, resulting
in the degradation temperature (T2%) of
the lignin polymer being increased from 192.97 to 236.86 °C.
The enhanced thermal stability of the lignin polymer is assumed to
be due to the increased molecular weight.25

Particulate Size of LPCL in the ABS Matrix after High-Shear
Processing
Figure 3 shows the optical morphology and particulate size that reveal
the improved dispersibility of the LPCL particulates in the ABS matrix
and the decreased size of LPCL particulates. The ABS appears as a
gray matrix and LPCL as a black island dispersed in the ABS matrix.
The particulate size of LPCL was decreased from 3395 nm (the extruded
composite) to 638 nm by high-shear processing at 1500 rpm/60 s. In
the ABS matrix, the size of LPCL particulates tends to decrease with
increasing processing time and shear rate. In addition, the dispersibility
of LPCL in the matrix is improved.

extruder and high-shear processed at [(B) b in graph] 500 rpm/10 s,
and [(C) c in graph] 1500 rpm/60 s. (D) Variation of the particulate
size according to various high-shear conditions.

The morphology of the composites were further confirmed by
SEM,
as shown in Figure 4A,B. SEM analysis was performed after LPCL was swollen with 25% acetic
acid solution for 20 min to facilitate the distinction between LPCL
and ABS.26 In the fabricated LPCL/ABS composite
by the twin-screw extruder, the LPCL particulates are of several microsizes
and are not uniformly dispersed in the ABS matrix (Figure 4A). On the other hand, the
high-shear-treated LPCL particulates show improved dispersibility
in the ABS matrix, and the size thereof is reduced to 638 nm (Figure 4B). With the same
context, the film of the extruded composite shows heterogeneous dispersion
of the LPCL in the ABS matrix; however, the case of the high-shear-processed
composite exhibits a homogeneous state (Figure 4C). Thus, the enhanced dispersibility identified
through morphological analyses is assumed to be due to the insertion
of LPCL and ABS molecular chains into different component regions
by high-shear stress.

10 wt
% of LPCL after swelling with acetic acid 25% solution to make the
LPCL particulates stand out; [(A) and left of (C)] extrusion, [(B)
and right of (C)] high-shear processed at 1500 rpm/60 s. The proposed
scheme shows the mechanism of Tg and viscosity
reduction by high-shear processing (bottom part).

The interpenetration of molecular chains leads to the shifted
glass
transition temperature, which was identified through thermal analysis
in the Tg results section.27 The scheme in the bottom part of Figure 4 shows improved dispersion
and reduced particulate size of the LPCL in the ABS matrix by high-shear
processing. The difference in the particulate size and dispersibility
by the high-shear equipment led to the disentanglement of ABS molecules
and the increased free volume around the LPCL particulates, resulting
in viscosity reduction and Tg decrease
of LPCL/ABS composites. Figure S1 of the Supporting
Information shows the UV–vis transmittance spectra of
the LPCL/ABS composite films. The ABS composite containing the lignin
polymer completely blocks light with the wavelength below 400 nm because
of the UV absorption capacity of lignin.7 The transmittance is directly proportional to the LPCL particulate
size at the wavelength above 400 nm. This behavior is related to the
total interface area between the filler–matrix within the composite,
along with the LPCL particulate size.28

Effect of the High-Shear Process on the Melt Viscosity
The
influence of the high-shear process on the melt behavior of LPCL/ABS
composites was studied by a rheometer. Rheological properties of LPCL/ABS
composites can be utilized to understand structure–property
relationships.

Figure 5A shows the shear viscosity as a function of the shear rate
for the neat ABS and the LPCL/ABS composites filled with LPCL 10 wt
%. The shear viscosity of the extruded composite and the high-shear
processed composite at 500 rpm/10 s is higher than that of the neat
ABS, but it decreases with increasing shear rate and processing time.
More specifically, the steady mode results show that the smaller the
size of LPCL particulates added to the ABS matrix, the lower the shear
viscosity of the composites (Figure 5B), that is, the viscosity of LPCL/ABS composites tends
to decrease as the applied shear stress increases. The decrease in
melt viscosity of the LPCL/ABS composite after high-shear processing
is assumed to be due to the incorporation of LPCL particulates into
the ABS polymer matrix and the applied shear stress to composite specimens.
The incorporated LPCL particulates can act as a lubricator that promotes
the motion of the chains and cause the non-Einstein viscosity phenomenon.14,15 When shear stress is applied to the LPCL/ABS composite, the LPCL
particulates can contribute to a decrease in viscosity because of
the preferential orientation of the PCL aliphatic chains along the
flow direction and the slip between the PCL and ABS chains.29,30 In addition, the improved dispersion and reduced particulate size
in the matrix by high-shear processing leads to the disentanglement
of ABS molecules and the increased free volume around the LPCL particulates,
resulting in viscosity reduction as shown in Figure 4.31 Thus, the
rheological properties, including the non-Einstein viscosity phenomenon,
of the LPCL/ABS composites in this study can be expected to improve
the processability and productivity, when the immiscible blends are
conducted through high-shear processing.

viscosity as a function of shear rate. (B)
Comparison of the shear viscosity at a shear rate of 100 s–1 for neat ABS and LPCL/ABS composites (which
is treated with 500 rpm/10 s and 1500 rpm for 10, 30, and 60 s).

Glass Transition Temperature
of LPCL/ABS Composites after High-Shear
Processing
The glass transition temperature of a polymer
can be explained by the free volume theory of polymer chains.32Tg of the LPCL/ABS
composite is investigated by DSC, TMA, and DMA analysis to demonstrate
the decrease in viscosity due to the increase in the free volume of
LPCL/ABS composites.

Figure 6A–D and Table 1 show the Tg results from
the three analytical methods, which reveal the same tendency that Tg decreased as the particulate size decreased. Tg of the LPCL/ABS composite significantly dropped
with the increasing interface area between LPCL and the ABS matrix
because of the decrease of the LPCL particulate size, most likely
demonstrating the excellent plasticizing efficiency with ABS. It is
assumed that the small molecule LPCLs migrate to the ABS polymer chains,
which greatly increases the free volume of the molecular chains, thereby
improving the chain mobility of the polymer and apparently reducing Tg. Figure 6C shows that the mechanical damping value of the LPCL/ABS
composite increases because of the increased interface area between
LPCL particulates and the ABS matrix, through decrease in the particulate
size through high-shear processing. The large interfacial contact
area between LPCL molecules and the ABS matrix significantly increases
the possibility of energy dissipation because of chain vibration and
interfacial sliding.33 Increasing the damping
effect due to energy dissipation between filler–filler molecules
or filler–matrix molecules can provide benefits of a longer
service life of the components and reduction in noise.34

Thermal Degradation of the ABS Polymer in High-Shear Processing
Thermo-oxidative degradation of ABS is a temperature-dependent
process. Degradation of the rubbery phase (polybutadiene) in ABS is
initiated by hydrogen abstraction from carbon α to unsaturated
bonds, producing hydroperoxide radicals, leading to carbonyl and hydroxyl
products.35 Thus, it is necessary to confirm
that low thermal stability, which is known to be a disadvantage of
ABS resin, is expected to affect the composite properties after high-shear
processing.

Figure 7 shows the weight loss and GPC curves for neat ABS and high-shear
processed ABS resin. Figure 7A shows that the thermal degradation of ABS3000/60 (specimen
of neat ABS resin treated with high-shear at 3000 rpm, 60 s) begins
at a relatively rapid rate from 170 °C, compared with the neat
ABS and ABS1500/60 (specimen of neat ABS resin treated with high-shear
at 1500 rpm, 60 s). This is because of the chain scission of ABS molecules
by heat and mechanical shear stress during high-shear processing.36 As confirmed by GPC in Figure 7B, the molecular weight of re-extrusion and
ABS1500/60 is similar to that of the neat ABS. On the other hand,
the number-average molecular weight and weight-average molecular weight
of ABS3000/60 are 38 000 and 83 000 g/mol and are about
37 and 35% lower than the neat ABS, respectively.

Figure 7 (A) TGA and (B) GPC curves
of the neat ABS, extrusion (re-extruded
ABS sample W/O LPCL by twin-screw extruder in our lab), ABS1500/60
(high-shear processed ABS sample W/O LPCL at 1500 rpm/60 s), and ABS3000/60
(high-shear processed ABS sample W/O LPCL at 3000 rpm/60 s).

Studies on recycling of ABS resins
have shown that thermal decomposition
does not occur, even if the extrusion process is repeated 4–5
times.37 It is considered that the high-shear
processing condition of 3000 rpm/60 s in this study is more severe
than the general extrusion conditions. As a result, the thermomechanical
degradation of ABS by thermal and shear stresses causes molecular
chain scission and reduces the molecular weight.38

Conclusions
ABS composites containing
the lignin-based polymer were fabricated
via extrusion and high-shear processes. The LPCL/ABS composite was
fabricated by high-shear processing to improve its dispersion characteristics
and decrease the particulate size of LPCL in the ABS matrix. The resulting
LPCL/ABS composites clearly showed non-Einstein viscosity phenomena,
seemingly due to the conformational rearrangement and the increased
free volume of ABS molecular chains in the vicinity of LPCL particulates
and completely blocked UV rays. Consequently, the non-Einstein phenomenon
due to the application of nonspherical LPCL particulates and the size
control in this study suggest an interesting plasticization methodology
for improving the processability and productivity of high-loading
filler/polymer composites and ultrahigh molecular weight polymers.
