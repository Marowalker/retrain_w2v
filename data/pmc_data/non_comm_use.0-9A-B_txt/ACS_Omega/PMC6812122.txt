and its heterostructures exhibit interesting electronic
properties and are explored for quantum spin Hall effect (QSHE) and
magnetism-based device applications. In present work, we propose a
heterostructure of graphene encapsulated by hydrogenated-graphene,
which could be a promising candidate for a variety of device applications.
We have carried out DFT calculations on this system to check its feasibility
to be a versatile material. We found that electronic states of multilayer
pristine graphene, especially the Dirac cone, an important feature
to host QSHE, can be preserved by sandwiching it by fully hydrogenated
graphene. The interference of electronic states of hydrogenated graphene
was insignificant with those of graphene. States of graphene were
also found to be stable upon application of an electric field up to
±2.5 V/nm. For device applications, multilayer graphene or its
heterostructures are required to be deposited on a substrate, which
interacts with the system opening up a gap at the Dirac cone making
it less suitable for QSHE applications, and hydrogenated graphene
can prevent it. Magnetization in these hydrogenated-graphene-sandwiched
graphene systems may be induced by creating vacancies or distortions
in hydrogenated graphene, which was found to have a minimal effect
on graphene’s electronic states, thus providing an additional
degree of manipulation. We also performed a set of calculations to
explore its applicability for detecting some molecules. Our results
on trilayer graphene encapsulated by hydrogenated graphene indicate
that all these observations can be generalized for systems with a
larger number of graphene layers, indicating that multilayer graphene
sandwiched between two hydrogenated graphene is a versatile material
that can be used in QSHE and sensor devices.

Introduction
The honeycomb lattice
structure of graphene (GR) is the nearest
analogy to Haldane’s model1 in condensed
matter physics. However, due to the weak spin–orbit coupling
(SOC) of carbon atoms, it is not an ideal quantum spin Hall insulator
(QSHI) or 2D topological insulator.2 The
quantum spin Hall effect (QSHE) is realized in GR, but the band gap
of GR is zero, limiting its application. For this reason, a lot of
work has been devoted to finding an alternative QSHI with high SOC
and high bulk band gap. A non-Haldane model system HgTe quantum well
has been found to be a good alternative. However, it requires low
operating temperature, which hinders its applications.3 Further, 2D allotropes of group VI(A) and V(A) have also
been predicted to be QSHIs.4 Out of these,
stanene (a 2D allotrope of tin) has been reported to meet most of
the requirements and has been studied both theoretically and experimentally.5−8

Even after all these developments, GR, both in pristine and
heterostructures
forms, is still being investigated for QSHE.9,10 To
preserve the QSHI nature, GR is generally coupled with 2D boron-nitrate
(2D BN) as a heterostructure, fabricated by alternating layers of
GR and 2D BN.11 Apart from 2D BN, other
2D materials, like WS212 and
MoS213 (inducing spin–orbit
coupling), yttrium iron garnet14,15 and EuS16 (inducing ferromagnetism), and MoSe217 (fabrication of Schottky devices),
have been studied for various applications. One of the biggest drawbacks
of these heterostructures is that they strain GR, opening up a band
gap in place of the Dirac cone, and fabrication of these abovementioned
structures is not a trivial process, as explained further in the text.
In the present work, we propose an alternative to this system by replacing
the 2D BN with hydrogenated GR (HG). This substitution preserves the
essential Dirac cone of the GR layer enabling the composite multilayer
system to host QSHE. However, there are certain benefits to this approach
over the GR–BN heterostructures as discussed below.

The
mismatch in the lattices between the graphene and other layers
may have profound effects on its structural and electronic properties.
For instance, a moiré pattern is seen in the crystal structure
of the GR–BN heterostructures as a consequence of a slight
mismatch of their lattice vectors.18 However,
these are reported to form inside the GR, and their effects on the
QSHI states are required to be studied in detail. Such an effect breaks
the inversion symmetry of the GR opening up a band gap. Further, the
QSHI states in GR are reported to be quite fragile due to which a
high-quality and defect-free sample is required. The preferred method
has been to mechanically exfoliate the sheets of GR via a Scotch tape
process.19,20 This process is also repeated for the fabrication
of 2D BN sheets, and then these sheets are stacked on each other in
the required orientation. Though this yields a high-purity and defect-free
sample, it requires a high level of skill and is time-consuming. While
a method like chemical vapor deposition is used, it creates nanoflakes
of GR rather than a continuous film.21 Other
than that, strain matching GR and 2D BN is again a complex process.22,23 Hence, the large-scale extension of this process is challenging.

On the other hand, to fabricate the proposed systems, one needs
to exfoliate multilayer graphene and only hydrogenate the outermost
layer. A similar technique has been implemented for the fabrication
of a heterostructure of GR and monolayer transition-metal dichalcogenides,24 or the recent developments in the fabrication
of high-quality graphene can be used for the same.25 In addition, the magnetization in HG can be modulated via
photolithographic processes.26 Such modulations
in the proposed GR–HG heterostructures can be used to tune
its properties for desired magnetic applications. We demonstrate this
tunability for GR and HG trilayer nanoribbons. Hence, the present
work is divided into two parts: In the first part, we discuss the
stability of the proposed systems and the role of HG in preserving
the essential electronic states of the GR layer. As the dimensions
of the gate in nanodevices are being reduced, it can be described
as 1D structures. Hence, in the second part, we construct nanoribbons
of up to 20 unit cellsa to study magnetization
in it. We also explore the ability of the HG–GR trilayer to
adsorb simple molecules such as H2, O2, CO2, and ethanol.

Computational Details
We have performed
the first-principles density functional theory
(DFT) calculations as implemented in the Quantum ESPRESSO (QE)28 package. We have used the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof
(PBE)29 exchange-correlation function and
included the DFT-D2 van der Waals corrections30,31 for representing the electron dispersion effect induced due to the
multilayer nature of the systems. A Γ-centered Monkhorst–Pack k-point grid of 15 × 15 × 1 was sufficient to
sample the irreducible Brillouin zone. A kinetic energy cutoff of
40 Ry for the wave functions gave the required convergence in the
total energy. This energy cutoff has been used in all the calculations
presented in this work. The pseudopotentials used in this work were
obtained from the PSlibrary version 1.0.32,33 Further, to limit the interaction between the periodic images of
the unit cell, a vacuum of ≈10 Å is added to the unit
cell above and below the trilayer system. The geometry optimization
was performed until the forces per atom were reduced to less than
10–6 Ha/au. The phonon spectra calculations of the
systems were performed by the density-functional perturbation method,
as implemented in QE.

To compute the edge states, nanoribbons
were constructed having
a width of up to 20 unit cells along the Y direction
and a single unit cell in the X direction. To minimize
the interactions from neighboring images, a vacuum of ≈10 Å
was added on both sides along the Y and Z directions. A k-point mesh of 6 × 1 ×
1 was used. A small and arbitrary initial value of the magnetic moment
was set for each atom for the spin-polarized calculations, and a full
geometry optimization was carried out to obtain the final magnetic
state. For computing the band structures, high-symmetry k-points of the Brillouin zone were selected along the path M →
Γ → K → M. The k-points were
generated by the XCrysDens package.34 It
may be noted that we have not considered spin–orbit coupling
since it is quite weak in both carbon and hydrogen atoms.

We studied two types of trilayer systems: (1) single GR layer sandwiched
between two HG layers denoted as system A and (2) single HG layer
sandwiched between two GR layers denoted as system B as illustrated
in Figure 1c,d, respectively.
As these are multilayer systems, the stacking angle is also an important
feature. The two selected different stacking angles are 0° generally
denoted as the AB configuration and 60° generally denoted as
the AA configuration, as shown in Figure 1a,b, respectively. The selection of the stacking
angle was done in accordance with the Bernal stacking method. For
convenience, the systems have been named using the following nomenclature:
a prefix is used to denote trilayer configuration, and a postfix is
used to indicate the stacking angle.

systems. (a,b) Top views
of the two different stacking angles (0 and 60° , respectively).
The axis of rotation is the z axis that is perpendicular
to the plane of the paper. (c,d) Different stacking orders (HG–GR–HG
and GR–HG–GR, respectively). These structures are before
geometry optimization.

As an example, the system
of GR encapsulated by HG with stacking
angle of 0° is named A0, while the system where HG is encapsulated
by GR with a stacking angle of 60° is named B60. Hence, the structures
have been named A0, A60, B0, and B60. Similar configurations for the
bilayer systems were also studied. However, from the phonon dispersion
calculations, they were found to be very unstable and hence were not
considered for the presented work. The crystal and band structure
details regarding these additional systems can be found in Figure S6. The systems described in the text
were generated using ATK Virtual Nano Lab.35

Results and Discussion
QSHE in Graphene–HG Heterostructures
We first
discuss the structures of the GR–HG heterosystems and
their stability. We then describe their band structures followed by
the effect of the electric field on the electronic structure properties
of these heterostructures.

Structure and Stability of Proposed Systems
In Figure 2, we
display the
optimized structures as well as phonons dispersion for A0, A60, B0,
and B60 systems. The carbon atoms present in the plane of the HG layers
are buckled due to the bonding with hydrogen atoms. A slight lateral
displacement of the outer layers is also seen with respect to the
central layer for A0 and B0 systems. The layers however approximately
retain their stacking angles with respect to the central plane. Such
a behavior has been reported in the 3R-type MoS2 system36 where one of the layers, when laterally moved
in the plane, showed a second energy minimum. The optimized lattice
constants of A-type and B0 and B60 were found to be 2.50, 2.50, 2.48,
and 2.48 Å, respectively. Note that the lattice constant for
graphene is 2.46 Å. Thus, the lattice mismatch between our proposed
systems and pristine graphene is less than 1.5%; it is an important
merit for the proposed systems.

Figure 2 (color online) (a) Top and (b) side views
of A0 system, (c) top
and (d) side views of A60 system, and (i,j) phonon dispersion of the
systems A0 and A60, respectively, plotted along the high-symmetry k path. (e) Top and (f) side views of B0 system, (g) top
and (h) side views of B60 system, and (i,j) phonon dispersion of the
systems B0 and B60, respectively, plotted along the high-symmetry k path.

To understand the stability
of the systems, phonon dispersion was
calculated (Figure 2). Most of the phonon frequencies
are positive with a few exceptions primarily in the vicinity of the
Γ-point for most of the systems. The spread along the k-axis of these negative frequencies is also small and likely
to be due to numerical errors rather than the instability in structure.37 The stability of these systems can further be
checked based on their cohesive and formation energies. The energy
of formation of the trilayer from monolayers and the binding energy
per atom can be calculated as 1   2  

Negative values of these energies suggest that the system
is thermodynamically
stable; that is, the processes that can decompose and (or) transform
these systems are forbidden and (or) very gradual. In Table 1, we show the energy of formation
of the trilayer from monolayers and the binding/cohesive energy per
atom. Taking into account the magnitude of the values from the last
column of the table, it may be concluded that the systems are energetically
and thermodynamically favorable.

the Trilayer Systems

The negative frequencies
near the Γ point do not necessarily
mean that the system is unstable as in this case the energetics are
favorable. This has been demonstrated in the work of Mounet et al.,38 where a screening of 2D materials from 3D bulk
was performed with the help of a high-throughput methodology. This
leads to the creation of a database of 2D materials that includes
their crystal structures, electronic band structures, and phonon dispersion.
They have classified the materials with negative frequencies near
the Γ-point as stable as their energetics were favorable. Further,
as the hydrogenated graphene layer is under strain, it will give rise
to negative frequencies, and as mentioned above, it does not imply
that the system is unstable. With these arguments, we may conclude
that the systems under consideration are stable.

Electronic
Band Structures of Proposed Systems
The
band structures for all the systems were calculated to assert the
feasibility of proposed systems to host QSHE. In Figure 3, we show the band structures
for all the configurations. Clearly, from the plot, we can note that,
for the different configurations of the proposed systems, the stacking
order or stacking angles seem to have little to no effect on the band
structure of the sandwiched layer. The band structures of all systems
were found to be quite similar, as they consist of the same components
arranged in different configurations. From the initial observation,
it may be noted that, at the K-point, there is a
Dirac point similar to that of pristine GR. However, there is an extremely
small and negligible gap, which is less than the error of DFT calculations;
hence, it can be considered as gapless. There are also some additional
bands flanking the Dirac point. These bands touch the Fermi level,
effectively interacting with the Dirac point providing an indirect
conduction path, indicating these systems to be semimetallic in nature.
If the proposed systems are semimetallic, then the possibility of
them hosting QSHE is reduced. However, detailed analyses of the band
structures show that they still hold a possibility of hosting QSHE.

Figure 3 (color
online) Band structures of (a) pristine graphene and (b)
hydrogenated graphene. Band structures of the systems (c) A0, (d)
A60, (e) B0, and (f) B60. Note that the Dirac point is present for
the systems A0, A60, B0, and B60 (see insets) and the band structure
of the trilayer systems is basically an addition of the band structures
of graphene and HG.

For understanding these
features further, we plot the k-resolved projected
density of states (PDOS) given in Figure S5. From these plots, one can observe
that the Dirac cone at the K-point is formed out
of the carbon atoms of the GR sheet, with negligible contribution
from the HG atoms. Further, the band structures of the individual
pristine GR and HG do not interfere with each other indicating a weak
chemical coupling between GR and HG. Hydrogen bonding is observed
when the distance of the hydrogen with the heavier and high-electronegative
elements such as O and N is of the order of 1.5–2.5 Å.
However, the distance of the hydrogen atoms nearest to any of the
carbon atoms from the GR layer is about 2.8 Å indicating negligible
interaction between the HG and GR layers. In addition, the electron
density overlap between these layers is also not present (see Figure S6). Thus, we may conclude that the presence
of the additional band does not affect or alter the presence of the
Dirac cone and the origin of the Dirac cone in the system can be attributed
to the central GR plane, providing a possibility of hosting QSHI states.

In order to examine whether if the HG layer shields multilayer
graphene, we studied trilayer graphene encapsulated by HG. Note that,
even in pristine trilayer graphene, the Dirac cone is preserved and
has a possibility of hosting QSHI states.39 We compute the band structure of this system and found that the
characteristics of trilayer graphene have been preserved (Figure S2) supporting the abovementioned claim.
Thus, the electronic properties of the graphene layers seem to be
protected by the HG layer. Recall that, for device applications, the
multilayer graphene, which holds QSHE, is generally required to be
deposited on a substrate. The substrate states then interact with
the graphene system opening up a gap at the Dirac cone making it less
suitable for QSHE-related applications. One way to protect the graphene
states would be to add an HG monolayer between the graphene and the
substrate. However, we found that the HG–graphene bilayer itself
is very unstable. Hence, it could be difficult to synthesize and then
deposit on a substrate. On the other hand, our calculations on the
HG-encapsulated monolayer, as well as trilayer graphene, indicate
that, upon deposition on a substrate, the graphene states are likely
to be protected by the HG layers, thus retaining the property of graphene
layers to host QSHE.

Effect of the Electric Field on Band Structures
of Proposed
Systems
It is well known that the electronic structure of
graphene is not affected by the applied electric field. Hence, an
application of an electric field to the HG–GR–HG trilayer
should not affect the Dirac cone. In the buckled structure of the
2D system such as silicene in the presence of the electric field,
the potential felt by the sublattice is different, which leads to
an opening up of a band gap. Hence, in the presence of the electric
field, if the HG layers due to their buckled nature interact with
the graphene layer in the presence of an electric field, the Dirac
cone may get altered. In order to probe the stability of the Dirac
cone in the presence of the electric field, the HG–GR–HG
trilayer systems in the A0 and A60 configurations were subjected to
electric fields in the range from −2.5 to +2.5 V/nm in
steps of 0.5 V/nm (see Figure 4). The electric field is modeled by a saw-tooth potential,
which is purely a mathematical technique. Hence, care must be taken
to set the boundary conditions so that the electric field drops to
zero in the vacuum region away from the HG layers.

Figure 4 (color online) Band structures
of systems A0 (a–j) and A60
(k–t) under electric fields of ±0.5, ±1.0, ±1.5,
±2.0, and ±2.5 V/nm. The energy range in the inset is from
0.75 to −0.75 eV.

Upon switching the electric
field, we noted that the Dirac point
present at the K-point is not affected at any given
value of the electric field. A few bands in the vicinity of the Γ-point
above and below the Fermi level do split. The projected density of
states (PDOS) analysis shows that these bands are from the HG layer
indicating that the HG states in A0 and A60 configurations do not
interfere with the those of GR even in the presence of an electric
field. Rather, it acts as a shield for the central GR layer. A similar
conclusion can be made for the systems B0 and B60 (see Figure 5). Unlike the A0 and A60 systems,
here, the Dirac point observed due to the GR sheets is split albeit
at high electric fields of about 4.0 V/nm and higher. Further, from Figure 2, it can be observed
that the range of negative phonon dispersion is higher than those
of A0 and A60. Thus, one may conclude that, in the A0 and A60 systems,
the Dirac point is quite stable. Hence, only these systems were considered
for further investigation. From the above observations of the systems
A0 and A60 and the derived conclusion, it is clear that the effect
on the electronic states of GR is not unfavorably affected. Thus,
the HG-encapsulated GR holds a possibility of hosting QSHE.

0.75 to −0.75 eV.

A direct method of testing
this claim would be calculating the Z2 topological invariant where Z2 =
1 means that the system is QSHI and Z2 = 0 means that the system is not QSHI. However, as these
systems are constructed via stacking of multiple layers and the system
as a whole is conducting, the current methods for determining the Z2 invariant cannot be reliably used here.2,40 An indirect method of determining if a system can host QSHE is to
compute the edge state and to count the number of band crossings,
which should be odd-numbered.41 Even this
method is difficult to implement since the systems A0 and A60 as a
whole have an indirect band closing between the bands of GR (at the K-point above the Fermi level) and HG (near the Γ-point
below the Fermi level), which will give the systems conducting edges.
Thus, the only possible ab initio method of determining whether the
systems A0 and A60 can host the QSHE is to verify that the electronic
states of GR are not affected. This has been performed and is concluded
that electronic states are indeed not affected. Hence, the proposed
systems A0 and A60 do have a possibility of hosting QSHE.

Magnetization in GR–HG Heterostructures
Magnetization
in graphene and related materials has been typically studied by adding
adatoms, which can be done using the scanning tunneling microscopy
method in a controlled manner.42,43 Magnetization may be
induced by creating vacancies or distortions in graphene.44 However, such modulation may significantly affect
the Dirac cone making graphene lose its QSHI states. Such limitations
may be overcome with the proposed HG–graphene system by introducing
distortions in the HG layer or by forming nanoribbons. As we shall
see below, by both methods, the graphene edge states are observed
in addition to significantly induced magnetic moments in the heterostructure.

First, we discuss the results of magnetization in nanoribbons.
For this purpose, we constructed nanoribbons with widths up to 20
unit cells by the procedure discussed in Computational
Details, in the zigzag and arm-chair conformations of the A0
and A60 systems and performed DFT calculations. The systems are further
named R0 and R60 for nanoribbons of systems A0 and A60, respectively,
to distinguish them from their parent systems.

We also added
a prefix Z to denote the zigzag nanoribbon and A
to denote the arm-chair nanoribbon. For example, a zigzag nanoribbon
of A0 is denoted as ZR0, while an arm-chair nanoribbon of A60 is denoted
as AR60. See Table 2 for detailed nomenclatures.

Table 2 Labeling Schemes
for Nanoribbons
conformation	system A0	system A60	
arm chair	AR0	AR60	
zigzag	ZR0	ZR60	
Before we discuss the electronic
structure, we make note the following
characteristics of the nanoribbons: (1) The structures have unique
atomic arrangements; that is, even if zigzag nanoribbons are created,
one of the edges is in an arm-chair configuration (see Figure 8c). (2) To observe the distinction
between the electronic states of zigzag and arm-chair nanoribbons,
their dimensions should be as large as possible.27 The 20 unit cell width nanoribbon was the largest system
that we could compute without reducing the accuracy of the calculations.
For each system, three sets of distinct DFT calculations were performed.
The first set of calculations was performed on systems without any
modification where the nanoribbons were constructed using the parameters
described in Computational Details. In the
second set of calculations, 2 unit cells from the center of the top
HG layer were removed to introduce a defect to increase the number
of edges of the HG (see Figure 8a). The third set of calculations was performed after saturating
all the dangling bonds with hydrogen for both systems described above.
Finally, band structures for all the above systems were computed.

The band structure of the system ZR0 is given in Figure 6a. As anticipated due to the
metallic nature of the systems, there is the presence of metallic
states at edges. The number of edge states is even. However, the edge
states are due to contributions from both conduction and valence bands.
For topologically protected states, there should be a pair of bands
that connects the conduction and valence bands while creating an odd
number of Dirac crossing/points.41,45 Thus, one
can conclude that these states are not topologically protected (as
explained herea). Interestingly, the presence
of absolute magnetization of about 7.18 μB/cell is
observed, causing a considerable spin split in the electronic structure
of the system. This is marked in Figure 6 by black arrows. This marked band originates
from the edges of both HG and encapsulated GR layers. Such behavior
is seen in the band structures of all of the systems (AR0, ZR60, and
AR60, see Figure 6),
which are not hydrogenated, asserting the importance of passivation
of the dangling bonds. The most remarkable observation is that the
electronic structures of the systems are independent of the direction
of the construction of the nanoribbon or the stacking angles between
the layers; that is, the nanoribbons A0 (A60) and R0 (R60) have similar
band structures even after selecting 20 unit cells.

Figure 6 (color online) Band structures
of (a) ZR0, (b) AR0, (c) ZR60, and
(d) AR60. The red lines represent up electron bands, and the blue
lines represent down electron bands. Some of the important features
of the band structure are highlighted by yellow circles. The black
arrows mark the edge states emerging from the edges of the HG layer.

We see that feature characteristics of the 0°
and 60°
stacking angles are present such as in the band structure of the ZR0
system (Figure 7a),
in the sense that the band crossing occurs at the integer value of
the k point while for the ZR60 system (Figure 7c) the band crossing is observed
near the half-integer k-points. This has been marked
by the translucent yellow circle in Figure 7. The majority of these features arise from
the dangling edge bonds, which have a very poor experimental realization.
Upon hydrogenation, all the ribbons display a significant change in
the band structure as well as magnetization. In Figure 7b,e, we show the band structures of the passivated
ZR0 and ZR60, respectively. A substantial change is observed. The
absolute magnetizations for both the systems are reduced drastically
to about 0.47 (0.71) and 0.56 (0.69), respectively, due to saturation
of the dangling bonds, which is reflected well in the reduced spin
splitting as compared to that of the non-hydrogenated systems. The
interference from HG layers is reduced so significantly that the electronic
states near the Fermi level are from graphene only.

Figure 7 (color online) Band structures
of (a) diss-ZR0, (b) hydrogenated
ZR0, (c) hydrogenated dis-ZR0, (d) ZR60, (e) hydrogenated ZR60, and
(f) hydrogenated dis-ZR60. The red lines represent up electron bands,
and the blue lines represent down electron bands. The green arrows
point to the edge states emerging from the edge atoms of graphene
alone. The splitting of bands due to passivation of the HG edges is
marked by yellow ovals.

It is only logical from
this discussion that further calculations
can be carried out either on zigzag or arm-chair ribbons. We carried
out the calculations on zigzag ribbons ZR0 and ZR60. Further, in order
to modulate magnetization, we introduce distortions in these systems
by removing 2 unit cells from one of the HG layers. We label these
distorted nanoribbons as diss-ZR0 and diss-ZR60, respectively. In Figure 7a,c, we show the
band structures of the diss-ZR0 (non-hydrogenated and passivated),
and in Figure 7d,f,
we show the band structures for diss-ZR60 (non-hydrogenated and passivated),
respectively. Due to the presence of an additional HG edge, an increase
in the absolute magnetization is observed. It has now increased to
7.49 μB/cell for diss-ZR0, further increasing the
split in the band structure. As mentioned earlier, the major contribution
to this split is from the edges of the HG. However, for diss-ZR60,
the magnetization has decreased by a small value to 7.14 μB/cell. This also explains the decrease in the number of degenerate
bands. Thus, by just increasing the number of edges of HG, the magnetization
of the proposed system can be altered, an additional parameter for
customization of the proposed system.

Interestingly, after hydrogenation,
the band structures of distorted
ribbons seem to resemble those of the undistorted ribbons (compare Figure 7b for the band structure
of ZR0 with that of diss-ZR0 in Figure 7c). However, this observation seems to be misleading
as on closer analysis we found that there are some noticeable and
important differences. First, there is a small increase in the spin
split due to the increase in edges. These spin-split states are primarily
in the vicinities of k = 0 and 2π/a, marked by yellow translucent ovals. This may imply that, by fine-tuning
the number of edges of HG, one can increase the magnetization of the
ribbon without significantly interfering the GR states at the Fermi
level. However, in order to retain most of the features of the graphene
states, especially the Dirac crossing, one may have to increase the
width of the nanoribbon up to 50 unit cells or more.27

Adsorption of Molecules
on GR–HG Heterostructures
Graphene with substitutional
nonmetal dopants or adatoms has been
widely studied for applications in sensing molecules and electrocatalysis.46 In this section, we test the applicability of
the proposed system for adsorption of molecules such as H2, O2, CO2, and ethanol. As it has been
proposed that QSHI like stanene can also be utilized for gas sensing
applications,47 a brief investigation was
performed on the proposed system. Concluded from the above, either
by nonpassivation of the edges or by increasing the distortions in
one of the HG layers, magnetization can be fine-tuned. The magnetization
in these systems can certainly be affected by the presence of additional
factors like adsorbed molecules. For this purpose, a base system consisting
of an 8 × 8 × 1 number of unit cells of the system A0 was
created. In order to induce magnetization, an asymmetric cavity was
created on the top HG, which was hydrogenated, since such a vacancy
or impurities are required as these molecules generally do not get
adsorbed on defect-free surfaces. In Figure 9, we show the image of the top HG with the
cavity along with the optimized structures of adsorbed H2, O2, CO2, and ethanol molecules on the system
A0. The adsorbed H2 molecule is shown in the yellow translucent
circle in Figure 9a.

trilayer system with cavity in the top HG layer. Only the top HG layer
is shown. (a) H2 molecule (in yellow region); (b) O2 molecule; (c) CO2 molecule; (d) ethanol molecule.

Geometry optimization of the distorted A0 system
with the molecules
adsorbed was carried out. These molecules are likely to change the
magnetization upon adsorption on the A0 surface. However, the total
number of the atoms exceeds 600 making the geometry optimization within
the DFT framework difficult. Hence, we performed the geometry optimization
using the Brenner force field for the substrate distorted A0 system
and RelaxFF force field for the adsorbed molecules as implemented
in the ATK VNL package35 until the maximum
absolute forces on the atoms were less than 10–4 eV/Å. Then the optimized geometry was used to calculate magnetization
using DFT. The DFT parameters are kept the same as described in Computational Details, except that the calculations
were performed for the Γ-point only due to a large number of
atoms. We observed a distinct and significant change in the magnetization
of the system for each molecule as summarized in Table 3. These changes can be easily
detected in the experiments. Hence, we may conclude that the proposed
system can be used to detect these molecules.

Conclusions
We performed DFT calculations on hydrogenated
graphene–graphene
trilayer systems with PBE exchange-correlation potential including
the DFT-D2 van der Waals correction for representing accurately the
phonon dispersion effects. We found that the heterostructure of graphene
encapsulated by hydrogenated graphene could be a promising candidate
for a variety of device applications. A detailed investigation shows
that this system does have a possibility of preserving and protecting
the edge states of GR. The presence of the HG layer makes the system
magnetic, which can further be tuned by controlling the vacancies
in HG layers. These defects or vacancies in the outermost HG layer
can also be used to detect molecules such as H2, O2, CO2, and ethanol since upon adsorption a significant
change in magnetic moments is observed, which can be detected experimentally.
An additional important feature that was noted was the system independence
on the direction of nanoribbons providing an additional simplicity
for experimental realization of the proposed system. Our results on
trilayer graphene encapsulated by HG indicate that the above observations
can be extended to these systems with a larger number of central graphene
layers. Interestingly, such systems are relatively simpler to fabricate
by first exfoliating or synthesizing multilayer graphene and then
hydrogenating the outermost layers. This work brings out the versatility
of the multilayer GR sandwiched between two HG layers and thus has
the merit of being experimentally investigated.

Generally, the presence
of negative frequencies indicates structural instability. However,
in this case, a careful examination of the phonon frequencies is required
before coming to a conclusion. The magnitudes of negative phonon frequencies
are not significant and so are their spread in momentum space; that
is, they are localized near the Γ-point only, for most of the
systems. We have increased various input parameters such as the cutoff
radius and number of k-points for optimization and
found them to reduce the range of k-points with negative
frequencies. Thus, these small magnitudes and spread of negative frequencies
are likely due to numerical instabilities or errors rather than the
structural instability. In addition, we also observed that the changes
in the electronic properties are negligible when compared with the
structure having a higher negative phonon dispersion. Further, these
negative frequencies are between two successive special k-points within the Brillouin zone, which generally increases because
of out-of-plane buckling and/or because of the strain due to the lattice
mismatch, as explained in text. Here, these negative frequencies are
very weak comparison; hence, upon fabrication on a substrate, they
are likely to die out
