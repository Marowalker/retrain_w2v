Surface
functionalities of activated carbon can be affected by
the presence of heteroatoms such as oxygen, sulfur, and nitrogen.
In this work, nitrogen-doped activated carbons (NACs) were prepared
from shrimp shells, and the effects of the mixing ratio (raw material
to an activating agent) on the porous texture and surface functionalities
were investigated. It was found that, with increasing the mixing ratio
(resulting in increasing N/C), the development of mesoporosity was
significantly observed. This led to decreasing microporosity and specific
surface areas (SSAs). The obtained NACs exhibited nitrogen functionalities
in the forms of pyridinic and pyrrolic groups. It was found that although
the pyridinic-N has a detrimental effect on the SSA, it does favor
the pseudocapacitance, leading to an enhancement in the ion storage
capability regardless of the low SSA.

1 Introduction
Activated
carbons (ACs) are widely used in many applications, such
as solid adsorbents in pollutant adsorption1−4 and as electrodes in fuel cells,
secondary batteries, and electrochemical capacitors.5−9 ACs are commonly produced from carbonaceous materials such as wood,10 coal,11,12 and coconut shells.13,14 In addition, they can be prepared from biomass wastes from agricultural
and industrial processes.2,15−18 Coal and coconut shells are commercially used as raw materials for
AC preparation. However, since biomass wastes are generally inexpensive
and abundant, their effective use is desirable.

The preparation
of AC involves two steps: carbonization and activation.
Activation of carbon materials increases their porosity and surface
area, leading to an increase in the adsorption capacity. There are
two types of activation that can be employed: physical and chemical.19,20 For physical activation, the raw material is first carbonized at
high temperature (600–900 °C) then activated by steam
or carbon dioxide, usually in a temperature range of 600–1200
°C. In contrast, carbonization and activation can be performed
simultaneously in chemical activation at a relatively low temperature
of 450–900 °C. Generally, the activating agents (i.e.,
NaOH, KOH, K2CO3, and H3PO4) are impregnated into the precursors followed by pyrolysis. With
chemical activation, the obtained ACs generally exhibit a much higher
porosity than those prepared by physical activation.

It is also
well known that chemical activation can introduce a
significant amount of oxygen-containing functional groups into the
carbon framework, which can increase the surface functionalities and
enhance the adsorption ability of ACs.21 In addition, the surface functionalities of ACs can be improved
by the presence of heteroatoms, such as nitrogen and sulfur,22,23 which can further enhance the adsorption ability of ACs. The common
ways to introduce such heterofunctionalities into the carbon framework
are (i) carbonization of a suitable heteroatom-rich precursor, (ii)
post-treatment in an oxygen- or nitrogen-containing atmosphere, and
(iii) molecular grafting of suitable functional groups.24−27 However, processes (ii) and (iii) generally employ several environmentally
unfriendly steps involving hazardous chemical reagents. Therefore,
to avoid such an environmental burden, using suitable precursors that
contain the heteroatoms would be preferable for cleaner production
of ACs.

Shrimp shells can be considered as a potential precursor
for AC
preparation as they are a byproduct of seafood processing and contain
nitrogen in the forms of chitin and nutrients. Therefore, the obtained
AC would contain nitrogen without a further environmental burden process.
Although there have been reports regarding AC preparation from nitrogen-containing
precursors such as aniline,28 pea skin,29 tea leaves,30 and
shrimp/prawn shells,31−33 the roles of nitrogen on the porous textures, surface,
and electrochemical characteristics are still unclear. In this work,
N-doped activated carbons (NACs) were prepared from shrimp shells
by varying the mixing ratio (shell to an activating agent). The obtained
NACs, with different surface characteristics and porous textures,
were fully characterized by N2 adsorption and X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy to fully understand the roles of nitrogen on the porous
textures and surface characteristics. In addition, their electrochemical
capacitive behaviors with different nitrogen functionalities were
also fully characterized.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Elemental Analysis
Elemental compositions
of the raw materials and NACs, including carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen,
are listed in Table 1. It can be seen that the amount of carbon in both precursors is
relatively low. Therefore, the addition of lignin can ensure a sufficient
amount of carbon to form the framework.34 By increasing the mixing ratio, WS/L/K or RS/L/K, from 1:1:2 to
3:1:2, the amount of nitrogen in the ACs (in terms of N/C) is increased
as expected.

2.2 Porosity Analysis
The obtained NACs
exhibit a combination of types I and IV of N2 sorption
isotherms (Figure 1a), indicating the development of micro- and mesoporosity. The specific
surface area of the NACs, calculated by using the BET equation (SBET), is also listed in Table 1 together with the total pore volume (Vtotal), micropore volume (Vmicro), and mesopore volume (Vmeso). Note that, in this work, SBET was
calculated from the data for 0.01 < PP0–1 < 0.05 as that obtained in a relative-pressure
range of 0.1–0.3 is always overestimated for high-surface-area
porous materials.35 The obtained NACs have
a high specific surface area ranging from 1546 to 2260 m2 g–1, which is comparable to those reported in
the literature.28,29,33,36

Figure 1 (a) Nitrogen sorption isotherms at −196
°C and (b)
DFT pore size distributions of the obtained NACs.

As previously mentioned, by increasing the mixing ratio, the amount
of nitrogen in the ACs (in terms of N/C) is increased. However, SBET and Vmicro of
the NACs are decreased with the increasing mixing ratio. In contrast, Vtotal and Vmeso tend
to increase to a certain point and then decrease. These results are
in good agreement with the density functional theory (DFT) pore size
distribution, shown in Figure 1b, and TEM images of the NACs (Figure 2). As the mixing ratio (or N/C) increases,
the micropore tends to decrease since the intensity of the peak at
about 1 nm is slightly decreased. Therefore, excessive nitrogen can
widen the small pores and decrease SBET.

Figure 2 TEM images of the obtained NACs (scale bar is 100 nm).

To fully understand the effects of nitrogen on the porosity
of
NACs, their porous characteristics, including SBET, Vtotal, Vmicro, and Vmeso, were plotted
versus N/C (Figure 3). It can be clearly seen in Figure 3a that an increase in N/C decreases SBET. However, an unclear tendency is observed between Vtotal and N/C (Figure 3b). Although Vtotal tends to increase with N/C, an excessive amount (above 0.04) significantly
lowers Vtotal. Since Vtotal consists of the micropores (Vmicro), mesopores (Vmeso), and
even macropores, it is difficult to draw a clear relation between Vtotal and N/C. A significant change in Vmicro can be observed in Figure 3c. As N/C increases, Vmicro is decreased as a result of the excess amount of nitrogen,
which can widen the pores. The relation between Vmeso and N/C (Figure 3d) is similar to that of Vtotal and N/C (Figure 3b) where the highest Vmeso is approximately
at an N/C of 0.04. Several impacts from pore structures, Vtotal, Vmeso, and Vmicro, on SBET are
also shown in Figure S1 (Supporting Information)
where it is well known that Vmicro has
a direct impact on SBET. As expected, SBET linearly increases with Vmicro.

(Vtotal), (c) micropore volume (Vmicro), and (d) mesopore volume (Vmeso) versus N/C.

2.3 Surface Characteristics
The surface
composition of the precursors and the obtained NACs was investigated
by XPS analysis, and their N 1s spectra are shown in Figure 4. The peak at 398.0 eV reflects
the presence of pyridinic-N, whereas the peak or shoulder at 400.2
eV can be ascribed to pyrrolic-N37,38 or the amine
group (R–NH2).39 In addition,
the peak at 395.4 eV can be assigned to the tetrahedral nitrogen-bonded
to sp3 C or nitrate-bonded metal clusters.40−42 The peak at 404.1 eV can be ascribed to the nitrogen of the acetyl
amide group or pyridinic oxide.39,42,43 It can be seen in Figure 4a,b that the shrimp shell precursors (WS and RS) contain nitrogen
(from the acetyl amide group), which originates from chitin and its
derivatives.39 Upon carbonization/activation,
the obtained NACs exhibit two major nitrogen functionalities, pyridinic-N
and pyrrolic-N (Figure 4c–f). It can be observed that after carbonization/activation,
the acetyl groups from the precursors disappeared to form other nitrogen
functionalities, especially pyridinic groups (Table S1, Supporting Information). In addition, by increasing
the mixing ratio, the amount of pyridinic-N was increased even with
the decreased SBET (see Table 1). Therefore, the pyridinic-N
clearly shows a detrimental effect on SBET.

(f) RS3 samples. Note that the solid and dotted lines represent the
raw data and curve fitting using the Gaussian equation, respectively.

2.4 Electrochemical Behaviors
Figure 5 shows the
cyclic
voltammograms of the obtained NACs. The voltammograms display a slightly
distorted rectangular shape, which indicates the ion storage through
the electric double-layer (EDL) mechanism. A broad peak at about 0.4
V can be observed, which can be ascribed to the presence of pseudocapacitance.
The specific capacitance for each sample was calculated from the integrated
voltammogram by the following equation  where C is the specific capacitance
(F g–1), E1 and E2 are the cut-off potentials for cyclic voltammetry
(V), i(E) is the instantaneous current
(A), ∫E1E2i(E)dE is the total charge
obtained by integrating the positive and negative sweeps of the cyclic
voltammograms (C), m is the mass of the active material
in the sample (g), and v is the scan rate (V s–1). The calculated specific capacitances are listed
in Table 2. All of
the samples exhibit a specific capacitance in the range of 150–180
F g–1. In addition, charge/discharge measurements
were performed on the obtained NACs (Figure 6). The resulting specific capacitance was
calculated by the following equation  where C is the specific capacitance
(F g–1), I is the current density
(1 A g–1), and  is the
slope of the charge/discharge plot
(V s–1). The resulting specific capacitances are
also listed in Table 2 and in the range of 246–277 F g–1, which
is comparable with those reported for N-doped activated carbons in
the literature.29,33,44,45 Since the NACs have different SBET and functionalities, it is not straightforward to
compare them in terms of the specific capacitance. Therefore, the
capacitance was calculated in terms of normalized capacitance (F m–2) by dividing the average specific capacitance (from
the cyclic voltammogram and charge/discharge measurement) with its SBET (Table 2). By increasing the mixing ratio, the normalized capacitance
is increased. This clearly shows that the nitrogen functionalities
directly affect the charge storage since the effects from SBET have been already ruled out.

To fully understand the effects of nitrogen on the
charge storage
behaviors, the specific capacitance and normalized capacitance were
plotted versus N/C. As can be seen in Figure 7a, the amount of nitrogen (in terms of N/C)
does not affect the specific capacitance. However, after taking SBET out of consideration, the normalized capacitance
increases proportionately with N/C (Figure 7b). The presence of nitrogen heteroatoms
can promote improvements in wettability, conductivity, and most importantly,
pseudocapacitance.33,44,46,47 To clarify the effects of nitrogen groups
on the capacitance, the normalized capacitance is plotted versus the
amount of each group (Figure 7c,d). It can be seen that the pyridinic group has a direct
impact on the normalized capacitance (Figure 7c). This further supports the idea that pyridinic-N
is responsible for the enhancement of pseudocapacitance, which is
in good agreement to those reported elsewhere.48,49 In contrast, a pyrrolic group has a detrimental effect on the normalized
capacitance (Figure 7d). These results clearly show the effects of different types of
nitrogen functionalities on the electrochemical characteristics where
the pyridinic-N is found to be beneficial.

3 Conclusions
Nitrogen-doped activated carbons
(NACs) were successfully prepared
from shrimp shells without a chemical-doping treatment. The amount
of nitrogen can be simply controlled by the mixing ratio. Excessive
nitrogen led to the development of mesoporosity, which reduced the
micropores and specific surface area. Although the obtained NACs contain
nitrogen in the forms of pyridinic and pyrrolic groups, the pyridinic-N
was found to play a role in the porous texture and the ion storage.
The specific area of NACs decreases significantly with pyridinic-N.
However, regardless of the effects from the surface area, pyridinic-N
has a direct impact on the ion storage capability, thanks to the contribution
from the pseudocapacitance.

4 Materials and Methods
4.1 AC Preparation
Two types of shrimp
shells, red (RS) and white (WS), were used as raw materials. Boiled
shrimp shells were ground into a powder form and were mixed with lignin
and K2CO3 at different mixing ratios (shell/lignin/K2CO3, w/w), varying only the weight of shrimp shells
(as listed in Table 1) with a sufficient amount of water. They were heated at 200 °C
until most of the water was evaporated and were further dried at 105
°C in an oven overnight. The impregnated shrimp shells were placed
into an alumina boat and inserted into a tubular horizontal furnace.
The samples were then activated at 900 °C (5 °C min–1) for 1 h under a nitrogen atmosphere. After that,
the samples were soaked with 1 M HCl for an hour to eliminate the
lime.34 The samples were then filtered
and dried at 105 °C overnight. For comparison, the activation
of lignin using K2CO3 (lignin/K2CO3 of 1:2 w/w) was also done at 900 °C for 1 h under a
nitrogen atmosphere.

4.2 Characterizations
The amounts of
carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen of the shrimp shells and the obtained
NACs were characterized by CHN analysis. Porous textures of the samples
were determined by N2 sorption measurements at −196
°C. The specific surface area was calculated by the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
method (SBET). The total pore volume was
estimated from the N2 adsorption amount at a relative pressure
of 0.95 (Vtotal). The micropore volume
was calculated from the Dubinin–Radushkevich (DR) equation
(Vmicro).50 Some of the NACs were characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS) using Mg Kα radiation at 12 kV and 25 mA. Some of the
AC samples were subjected to transmission electron microscopy (TEM;
JEOL: JEM 3100F), X-ray powder diffraction (XRD; Rigaku Miniflex 600
with a Cu Kα source, 40 kV and 15 mA), and Raman (HORIBA T64000,
532 nm) analyses.

Electrochemical characterizations were performed
by using the three-electrode configuration. For the electrode preparation,
the obtained NACs were mixed with carbon black and polytetrafluoroethylene
at a weight ratio of 9:0.5:0.5 to form a uniform solid sheet. After
that, the sheet was cut into a square shape and was pressed into the
stainless-steel mesh. It was then impregnated with the electrolyte
(overnight) before the measurements. Cyclic voltammetry was performed
to observe the electrochemical capacitive behavior of the NAC electrodes.
The electrolyte, reference, and counter electrodes are 0.5 M H2SO4, Ag/AgCl in 3 M KCl, and platinum, respectively.
