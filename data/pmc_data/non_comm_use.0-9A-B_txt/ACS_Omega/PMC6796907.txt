Nanodiamond
synthesized by the detonation method is a composite of sp3/sp2 carbon structures; amorphous and disordered-sp2 carbons populate the surface of a sp3 diamond
core lattice. Because of the production process, various elemental
impurities such as N, O, H, and so forth are inherent in interstitial
sites or the surface carbon (sp2/amorphous) network. Herein,
the reaction dynamics on the surface of ultradisperse diamond (UDD)
due to the surface transformation or reconstruction during annealing
in vacuum with temperatures ranging from ambient to 800 °C is
described. In situ measurement of Fourier transform infrared spectroscopic
analysis shows that low-temperature (<500 °C) annealing of
UDD in vacuum results in isonitrile/isocyanide (−N=C:)
and nitrile functionalization (−C≡N) on the surface.
At temperatures ∼500 °C, the surface hydrogenation of
UDD is initiated. During annealing at 780–800 °C, the
nitrile group (−C≡N) is reduced to the primary amine
(NH2), and isonitrile (−N=C:) turns it to
be in the saturated ()
structure. On exposure to air, the obtained isonitrile is transformed
to an N-formyl derivative (Aryl/R–NH–CHO)
structure via hydrolysis. This study provides a fundamental insight
into the surface reactive profile of UDD which could lead to facile
surface functionalization properties and their applications in various
fields such as biomedical, biosensing, drug delivery, epoxy materials
process, tribology, and possibly in cyano (−C≡N/–N=C:)
chemistry.

Introduction
Nanodiamonds (NDs)
are a promising material in the carbon family with numerous applications
at the interface of biology, medicine, and physical science. Super
hardness, high thermal conductivity, and chemical resistance make
them useful in cutting, polishing, material coatings, and cooling
additives in lubricants.1 At the same time,
visibly excited color centers (such as the NV– ≈
637 nm, NV° ≈ 575 nm) with stable luminescence, phonon
vibrational signature (1332 cm–1), tailorable surface,
and innate biocompatibility make NDs a unique tool in photonics and
bio/medical applications, for example, in biosensing, biolabeling,
imaging, and drug delivery, and so forth.1,2 With
various novel properties, NDs, however, exhibit some major drawbacks,
such as aggregation/clustering and inhomogeneous surface-chemical
reactivity because of their complex surface structure.3,4 The observed surface complexity is widely considered to be driven
by the non-diamond carbon fragments (sp2; fullerene or
graphene such as shells and amorphous) including various oxide groups
which are inherently settled on the surface of the processed ND.5,6

The surface chemistry of ultradisperse diamond (UDD), also
referred as detonation ND (DND), compared to other synthetic diamonds
is still poorly understood. It is well known that due to the narrow
size distribution and high surface area, UDD contains large amount
of non-diamond carbons (sp2/amorphous) with several elemental
contents such as O, N, H, and so forth on the surface.1,3 Recently, it has been shown that annealing UDD in vacuum/gas phase
yields catalytic activity.7−9 Various studies suggested that
the surface elemental bonding–rebonding and desorption processes
during annealing which lead to the structural transformation or reconstruction
of the surface non-diamond carbon structures are the key factors of
the surface reactivity of UDD.7,8,10 Thus, the analysis of surface signatures during vacuum annealing/post-treatment
of UDD is crucial to uncover their reactive profile.

In general,
the reduction/hydrogenation of nitrile or isonitrile occurs in the
presence of metal (Pt, Pd, Ni, etc.)/metal free catalysts.11−13 It is assumed that the reduction of the cyano-group (−C≡N/–N=C:)
formed by annealing on the surface of UDD could be activated by the
influence of high temperature in the presence of atomic/radical hydrogen.
The origin of atomic/radical hydrogen is the effect of hydrogen molecule
(H2, abundant in all vacuum chambers) dissociation activated
by the annealing of UDD at low temperatures (∼500 °C).8,14

The surface modification with suitable linkers is a required
process to utilize ND for further applications. Over several processes,
hydrogen treatment is considered to be substantially effective to
stabilize the diamond surface for further chemical terminations. Functionalization
of NDs with amino groups (N–H/NH2) is viable as
a platform of conjugating larger moieties such as drugs, proteins,
genes, molecular compounds, and so forth.15,16 Besides, amino-functionalized ND is widely applied to enhance the
hardness of epoxy resins17−19 which are used in various fields,
such as aerospace, navigation, anticorrosion, and so forth.20 It also has significant potential in solid-state
peptide synthesis and as a solid support in chromatography/separation
science.17,21

In this work, in situ measurement
of Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopic analysis of UDD
annealed in vacuum at the range of room temperature to 800 °C
is described. At each annealing step and temperature, in situ IR spectra
were obtained and analyzed. It was found at low temperature ∼300 °C, annealing of UDD
enables the surface nitrogen to be rearranged as isonitrile (−N=C:)
and nitrile (−C≡N) bonding and the surface hydrogenation
to start, the C–H functionalization is found to be initialized
at ∼500 °C in this study, depending on the availability
of the hydrogen in the chamber. With further annealing, the obtained
isonitrile (−N=C) and nitrile (−C≡N) are
reduced by the radical hydrogen at higher temperature (780–800
°C) which leads to a multifunctional surface of UDD with amine
(N–H/N–H2)/N-formyl derivative
(−NH–CHO).The observed results reveal that the surface
chemistry of UDD could be dependent on the desorption, reconstructions,
or structural transformations of the non-diamond carbons.

Materials and
Methods
Synthetic ultradispersed diamond (UDD) particles
of grain size 4–5 nm were sourced from PlasmaChem GmbH, Germany
(Grade G01). These particles contain metal contaminants such as Fe,
Cu, Zn, Mn, and so forth, with negligible percentages [see the Supporting Information]. Powder of 50 nm diamonds
was purchased from Microdiamant, Switzerland. For FTIR measurements,
samples of ND with concentration of 2 mg/60 mL were dispersed in deionized
water and drop-cast onto Si substrates with 20 mL of solution. They
were then dried in the desiccator for 24 h. To obtain larger volumes
of specimen, drop-casting was repeated two/three times over the previous
layer. A sample holder was prepared using tantalum foil and wire to
secure the Si substrate. The samples were placed in a UHV chamber
directly in the path of the infrared beam of the FTIR apparatus. All
IR measurements were performed in situ at room temperature after the
samples had been subjected to various temperature annealing steps,
at a chamber base pressure of ∼2 × 10–7 Torr. The spectra were collected using Bomem MB154 FTIR equipped
with an MCT-liquid nitrogen-cooled detector. The resolution was set
to be 4 cm–1, and 400 scans were used. Ambient humidity
around the FTIR was ∼38–40%. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic
(XPS) data were collected using Thermo Scientific Al-K-Alpha X-ray
Photoelectron Spectrometer at the ∼3 × 10–9 Torr vacuum level. The fitting of XPS spectra was calculated using
the Thermo Scientific software package. Raman spectra were recorded
using a JY T6400 spectrometer with 325 nm wavelength of laser excitation
of ∼0.4 mW power, accusation time ∼30 s.

Results and Discussion
Figure 1a(i) shows
the FTIR spectrum of untreated UDD. A broad band around the range
of 1000–1250 cm–1 is well known for the cyclic
ether/ester groups C–O–C/C–O on ND. The C=O
peak attributed to the carboxylic acid (−COOH)/ketone (R–CO–R)/acid
anhydride group is observed at the range 1650–1800 cm–1. Features with the broad bands at 1620–1640 and 3400–3600
cm–1 correspond to hydroxyl group OH, originated
from the surface-adsorbed water/COOH groups.22 The atmospheric CO2 is identified in the range of 2350–2400
cm–1. The C–H stretching feature from various
origins is visible at the range of 2800–3000 cm–1.23

UDD measured in situ; (a) (i) untreated UDD, (ii–iv) corresponds
to the UDD annealed at various temperatures (500, 750, and 800 °C)
in vacuum (base pressure ∼2 × 10–7 Torr),

2050–2380 cm–1, and (d) for the samples (iii–v)
in the range of 3000–3650 cm–1.

After annealing UDD at temperatures nearly 300 °C (figure
shows at 500 °C, <500 °C is presented in the Supporting Information) in vacuum, two distinct
peaks shown in Figure 1a(ii) appear at ∼2143 and ∼2259 cm–1 which are attributed to the iso-nitrile/isocyanide (−N=C:)
with conjugated structures and nitrile (−C≡N) groups,
respectively.22,24 A slightly broadened band assigned
for the C=N stretching vibration or N-incorporated C=C
(−N=C=C<) bond in a graphitic ring/carbon
chain is observed at 1595 cm–1.22,25 This band is defined as the characteristic band of the isonitrile
(−N=C:).22 It is noted that
as the OH group corresponds to a broad band in the range 1620–1640
cm–1, the IR peak of the C=N structure could
be overlapped at the room temperature as shown in Figure 1a(i).

It has been studied
that the DND contains elemental nitrogen (N) as most abundant impurities
which can be present in the interstitial and surface carbon structure.26 The FTIR spectrum of the observed carbon–nitrogen
bonding known as the cyano-group strongly indicates that UDD contains
a considerable amount of nitrogen at the surface which is bonded in
the surface carbon network. In the previous study, it has been shown
that annealing UDD at low temperature (<500 °C) results in
the desorption of surface carbon as a radical form.8 Therefore, it is assumed that during the desorption of
surface carbon as well as other molecular groups, the surface nitrogen
could be rearranged with a form of sp/sp2 carbon–nitrogen
bonding as shown in Scheme 1. The probable configuration of the nitrile and isonitrile,
in general, is expected at the terminus of a graphitic ring or linear
carbon chain. It is noted that the similar characteristic bond is
commonly observed during the carbon-nitride (CN) thin-film deposition.25,27 It is well known that nitrile and isonitrile have two resonant structures
as shown below

Scheme 1 (a) Untreated UDD with Possible Surface
Groups (Schematically Displayed), a Part of the Upper Layer is out
of the Circle; (b) Modified Surface after Annealing in the Range 300
°C < T < 750 °C
The electronic structure analysis of isonitriles using
high-level valence bond calculations suggests that isonitriles are
better described as carbenes than as zwitterionic structures. Moreover,
the linearity of the carbene favors delocalization of the nitrogen
lone pair leading energetic stabilization.28,29 Therefore, the possible structure of nitrile and isonitrile could
be considered for our reaction study in their charge neutral state
(−C≡N: and −N=C:). The density of these
bonds could be influenced by the temperature of the medium as isonitrile
(−N=C:) could be transformed into the nitrile (−C≡N)
structure or vice versa over 200 °C.30,31

At 500 °C, two distinct peaks at 2875–2945 cm–1 attributed to C–H as shown in Figure 1a(ii) appeared. This C–H
feature suggests that the origin of C–H bonding is from the
dangling carbon of a tetrahedral diamond lattice, not from graphitic/amorphous/polymeric
hydrocarbons that are physically adsorbed on the ND surface. The physically
adsorbed CH would have been desorbed at this temperature under vacuum.23 In addition, previously, the authors have shown
that the hydrogenation of UDD can be derived by the radical dissociation
of molecular hydrogen (H2) during annealing of UDD at relatively
low temperatures (<500 °C).8,14 In this case,
although there was no external source of H2, a similar
effect could be obtained from the low concentrations of hydrogen molecules
(background H2) present in all vacuum chambers;32,33 and this was also evidenced from the mass spectra of our previous
result.8 At higher temperatures (>550
°C), the dominant feature of C–H adsorption confirms that
the rate of H2 availability is higher at high temperature
(observed from >550 °C) due to degassing, corresponding to
a common phenomenon of the vacuum system from the stainless chamber
walls.32,33

At 800 °C (observed from ∼780
°C), the peak assigned for the nitrile group (−C≡N)
is completely disappeared as shown in Figure 1c(iv). At the same time, a distinct band
in the range of 3200–3450 cm–1 shown in Figure 1d(iv) is observed
corresponding to the primary amine (NH2) with symmetric
and asymmetric stretch vibrations.34 A
small peak at lower frequencies ∼1450 cm–1 assigned to the C–H2 deformation vibration is
also found as shown in Figure 1b(iv).22 The formation of primary
amine as well as C–H2 groups indicates that the
nitrile group has been reduced/hydrogenated by annealing at 800 °C
which leaves the alkyl-conjugated amine structure (−CH2–NH2) on the surface of UDD. In general,
hydrogenation/reduction of nitrile occurs in the presence of metal-catalysts
such as Ni, Pt, Ru, and so forth.11,12 It has been
found that in the gas phase, atomic hydrogen does not react with nitrogen
atoms at temperatures lower than 350 °C; even over 350 °C,
the reaction efficiency is negligible.35 In contrast, Li and Tan have shown that atomic/radical hydrogen
can interact with nitrogen at temperatures over 700 °C, which
leads to the direct hydrogenation of the carbon-nitride structure.36 We assume that high-temperature (780–800
°C) annealing of UDD could provide enough surface activation
energy to stimulate the reduction of nitrile via adsorption of radical
hydrogen in the reaction chamber.8 The
reaction mechanism of nitrile reduction proposed is displayed in Scheme 2. It is noted that
for alkyl-amine (−CH2–NH2), a
stretching band of C–H with medium intensity is expected at
the region of 2850–2945 cm–1. However, as
the C–H peak on diamond surfaces carries the dominant character
at the same frequency range, therefore, C–H for the alkyl structure
could be overlapped with the diamond feature.

Scheme 2 Reaction Steps of
the Formation of Primary Amine on the Surface via Multiple (Step1
& 2) Reductions of the Nitrile Group During Annealing the UDD
at 780–800 °C in Vacuum
In the case of isonitrile, the IR peak at ∼2143 cm–1 corresponds to its conjugated/unsaturated (≡C–N=C:/=C–N=C:)
structure,22 the most probable conjugated
structure in our sample is expected with graphitic rings as shown
in Scheme 1. At a temperature
of 750 °C, the peak is slightly shifted toward the down frequency
at 2137 cm–1. At the same time, a new peak is raised
around ∼2175 cm–1, which corresponds to an
unconjugated/saturated form of isonitrile, as shown in Figure 1c(iii) (marked by arrow).22 It has been well studied that isonitrile/isocyanide
exhibits relatively higher basicity than nitrile in reaction medium,
especially in the gas phase.37,38 Because of this basicity,
it is expected that during annealing of UDD, the nitrogen atom in
isonitrile (Scheme 1b) could donate a lone-pair electron to the adjacent graphitic ring
as can be seen in conjugated/aryl-amine.39 It has also been found that isonitrile/isocynaide in a conjugated
structure (R–N=C: or Aryl-N=C) can act as a radical
acceptor.40,41 Therefore, the observed frequency shifting
from 2143 to 2137 cm–1 could be a simultaneous effect
of the hydrogen radical attack as well as the structural transformation
of isonitrile due to basicity. The possible result of the reaction
is shown in Scheme 3(i); steps (1–3).

Scheme 3 (i) Reaction Steps of Isonitrile for the
Transformation of Unsaturated to Saturated Structures; Steps (1–2)
Describes the Possible Resonance State of Isonitrile during Annealing
of UDD, Step 3 is the Stage of Hydrogen Radical Adsorption to the
Terminal Carbon of Isonitrile, Step (4–5) Shows Radical Stabilization
in the Carbon–Nitrogen Chain before the Next Hydrogen Attack,
Step 6 is the Possible Stage of Radical Neutralization in the Chain
via Hydrogen Adsorption Corresponding to a Saturated Structure of
Isonitrile; (ii) Hydrolysis of Isonitrile under Air Exposition, Resulting
in the Formation of the N-formyl Derivative Structure
(Steps 1–2)
As a result of hydrogen
termination in step 3, an unpaired electron/free radical is created
at the terminated carbon of the isonitrile which is transferred immediately
to the ring structure because of its stabilization via a resonance
stage as shown in steps (4–5).42,43 The obtained
radical could finally be neutralized by termination with successive
hydrogen radicals as shown in step 6. As a result, the isonitrile
is transformed to an unconjugated or saturated structure corresponding
to the IR peak at 2175 cm–1. The small intensity
of the peak indicates that the kinetic energy of the reaction might
not be enough to provide a large amount of product at 750 °C.
At higher temperature (780–800 °C), the reaction is completely
observed, leading a distinguished IR feature of saturated isonitrile
at 2175 cm–1 as shown in Figure 1c(iv).

On exposure to the air/moisture
of the sample after annealed at 800 °C, a distinguished side
band at 1694 cm–1 corresponding to the C=O
bond in a conjugated amine structure (−NH–CO−)
is observed as shown in Figure 1b(v).22,44 A sharp peak is also observed
at 1577 cm–1 which could be related to N–H
deformation.22,45 We assume that during the sample
exposure/transfer to the ambient (from vacuum after annealing at 800
°C), the obtained structure of isonitrile is shown in Scheme 3(i); step 6 could
be hydrolyzed and transformed to the N-formyl derivative
(Aryl/R–HN–CO–H) structure by tautomerization.46,47 The reaction steps are displayed in Scheme 3(ii); step (1–2). Note that after
tautomerization, the remaining negative charge at the ring structure
could be neutralized by the released proton (−H+). In the FTIR spectrum, the effect of N–H stretching vibration
(3300–3500 cm–1) is not very obvious. The
reason for this could be the result of frequency overlapping with
primary amine (NH2)/adsorbed-OH which lead to a broad band
around ∼3200–3600 cm–1 as shown in Figure 1d(iv). It is also
noted that after the air exposition, the remaining peak of isonitrile
at 2175 cm–1 as shown in Figure 1a(v) could be the effect of unsaturated/lack
of hydrolysis in the duration.

The obtained N-formyl derivative was stable at room temperature. It should be noted
that after the amide stage (−HN–CO−), further
hydrolysis cannot be possible as the reaction steps require a catalyst
such as strong acid (H2SO4) or strong base (NaOH)
with specific temperature conditions.46,48 For the confirmation
of the air effect, after annealing of UDD at 800 °C, the sample
was kept in vacuum overnight; no trace of the amide structure was
found. This indicates that all of the reactions occurred inside the
chamber have taken place via radical reaction, not by the influence
of protonation/ionization.

Figure 2 shows the XPS analysis of UDD. In Figure 2a, the comparative
analysis of the C 1s band for the untreated (i) and (ii) treated UDD
at 800 °C (Vac. ∼2 × 10–7 Torr)
followed by air exposition for 24 h is shown. For the untreated UDD,
deconvoluted fitting shows that the C 1s spectrum corresponds to the
presence of sp2 (∼284.8 eV), sp3 (∼286.3
eV) hybridized carbon, and their oxide groups such as C–O/C=O/COOH
(∼287–288 eV).49,50 This oxide region in
C 1s is sometimes attributed to the C–N energy band for nitrogen-doped
carbon structures; however, it has been ignored in our analysis due
to the presence of the high-level oxygen signal.51

Figure 2 Comparative XPS analysis of (a) C 1s, (b) N 1s, and (c) O 1s for
untreated UDD (i,ii) annealed at 800 °C followed by air exposition
for 24 h; (d) survey spectrum of the corresponding samples in the
region of C 1s, N 1s, and O 1s.

In the case of treated samples, a significant reduction of the sp2 carbon feature is observed as shown in Figure 2a(i,ii). A parallel ratio of the reduction
of oxide functional groups is also obvious which indicates desorption
of non-diamond carbon fragments present on the surface of UDD. The
maximum elimination of C=O groups corresponding to the acidic
group is observed. In contrast, the C–O bonding is found more
stable at high temperature in both cases. The possible reason of their
higher stability could be due to the C–O–C cyclic bonding
on the surface of ND.52 The obtained results
are quite consistent with the FTIR feature. As compared to the untreated
sample, the full width at half-maximum (fwhm) of the C 1s spectrum
is reduced by 0.35 eV for the treated one. It can be assumed that
this spectral narrowing could be due to desorption of amorphous/sp2 contents with oxide groups (dotted line with arrow marked),
enhancing the surface area of the particle with a higher atomic percentage
of sp3 core structures. After annealing, a shifting of
the sp3 carbon band is also observed which indicates surface
hydrogen (C–H) adsorption on diamond.49,53

Figure 2b shows
the corresponding analysis of the N 1s energy band. Three deconvoluted
curves have been fitted in our analysis. For untreated UDD, the peak
at 399.3 eV refers to the sp3-hybridized nitrogen–C/carbon–nitrogen
covalent bonding (−N<) as can be seen in Scheme 1a.50 The band with a peak at 400.3 eV corresponds to the sp2N–C (399.6–400.3 eV)-bonded structure in the surface
graphitic layer of UDD, related to C=N bonds observed in FTIR
(1595 cm–1).54 A side
band corresponding to the oxidized nitrogen structure is observed
at 403.7 eV.51 After the sample is annealed,
a major spectral shift of 399.3–399.8 eV was observed. This
shift is related to the formation of the amine/amide (N–H or
NH2) bond on the surface of UDD,55,56 and this is also evidenced from the FTIR spectra [Figure 1a(v)]. The relative intensity
of the graphitic C=N band (400.3 eV) for the annealed sample
is found to be decreased slightly. As UDD contains graphitic/fullerene/graphene-like
fragments on its surface, the downward intensity of 400.3 eV could
be related to their deformation/desorption during annealing. The band
related to the oxide group (402.0–406.0 eV) is identified as
sharper than the untreated one. This could be due to surface oxygen
reduction as well as their rearrangement in an ordered structure.
In this case, the fwhm of the N 1s spectrum is reduced by 0.45 eV;
the spectral narrowing in the range of 397–399 eV (marked by
arrow) indicates the structural transformation of C–N bonding.51 After annealing UDD, although the sp2 carbon concentration is reduced as compared to the untreated one
(Figure 2a(ii)), the
nitrogen (N) concentration remains almost unchanged as shown in Figure 2b(ii). This result
indicates that the distribution of most nitrogen contents is not in
the outer layer of the surface carbon network, rather in the adjacent
graphitic layer of the crystalline sp3 structure of UDD,
which are stable at high temperatures.

Figure 2c shows a comparative analysis of the O 1s
spectrum with three deconvoluted curves that confirm the presence
of C–O (533.3 eV), C=O (531.4 eV), and O–H (532.9
eV) groups on both untreated and surface-treated UDD.57,58 Compared to the untreated sample [Figure 2c(i)], a relative reduction of C=O
and O–H groups is observed for the treated one. However, the
presence of C–O groups remains almost unchanged. In general,
C–O groups on diamond surfaces are mostly found as cyclic ether,
where oxygen is bonded with two dangling carbons (C–O–C).
Because of their bonding nature, C–O groups could be more stable
on diamond surfaces at high temperature.52Figure 2d(i,ii) corresponds
to the comparative survey analysis of untreated and treated UDD with
the C 1s, N 1s, and O 1s spectral region.

Figure 3(i,ii) shows the Raman spectra of untreated
and treated UDD in the range of 1000–2000 cm–1. UV laser with 325 nm excitation wavelength was used to induce higher
sp3 scattering/suppress the D-band as well as avoiding
the visible-luminescence associated with amorphous/sp2 carbon
which leads the spectral overlapping with the diamond signal.59,60 In Figure 3(i), on
the UDD spectrum, a broad band between 1100 and 1400 cm–1 is expressed. The deconvoluted feature shows that the band is composed
of trans-polyacetylene at 1150 cm–1 shouldered with amorphous carbon at 1250 cm–1,
the first-order sp3-diamond mode at 1326 cm–1, and the disordered (D-band) carbon band in the range of 1370–1400
cm–1.59,60 The down-shifting of
the characteristic diamond peak compared to bulk diamond (1332 cm–1) is due to the phonon confinement effect observed
in narrow-sized (<10 nm) crystal structures.61 The well-known G-band related to the graphitic structure
on diamond is observed in the range of 1540–1650 cm–1. As the size of UDD is very small and the surface contains large
fraction of sp2 or amorphous carbons, the exposed radiation
by laser in ambient can be absorbed and produce heat on the focal
point which can burn the sample surface. Because of the burning effect,
the spectrum of UDD can be undefined, resulting in the low signal
to noise ratio as observed. Therefore, in the case of Raman spectral
measurement of UDD, very small power (∼0.5 mW) is used which
provides a higher signal to noise ratio.

Figure 3 Raman spectra of UDD
(i) untreated UDD and (ii) annealed UDD at 800 °C in vacuum and
then exposed in air for 24 h.

The deconvoluted G-band suggests the presence of the C=C bond
in fullerene/graphene shell-like fragments with the peak position
at 1590 cm–1 and O–H bonded structures on
the corresponding sp2 carbon site at 1640 cm–1.62 Over 1650 cm–1 is
generally attributed to C=O surface groups which are not significant
in our sample spectrum.62 In contrast,
the diamond signal for the treated UDD is found intensified and more
obvious. This result indicates the decay/desorption of sp2 fragments/amorphous phase from the surface of the treated particles
as sp2 exhibit higher Raman scattering cross-section than
sp3 which leads to an overshadowed diamond signal for untreated
UDD.63 A distinguished D-band with reduced
intensity at 1400 cm–1 is observed. The broadened
shape of the D-band shouldered with the diamond signal relates to
the higher disorder on UDD than treated one. In addition, it also
provides an understanding of structural reconstruction or transformation
of the surface carbon network during annealing and possible carbon
desorption which leads to elemental (C, N, and O) rebonding in the
surface matrix. A consistent result is also obvious in G-band analysis;
comparative signal intensity attributed to graphene/fullerene shell-like
carbon (1590 cm–1) is enhanced in the treated UDD.
As the most shell-like carbon structures are defined on the adjacent
layer of the sp3-diamond core,1,63 the
increased intensity of 1590 cm–1 indicates the desorption
of outer layer carbon fragments (amorphous/sp2) as well
as the bonding and rebonding of surface elements that transforms the
surface structure into an ordered shape. From the analysis of the
G-band, it can be suggested that there is no substantial graphitization
effect on the sample during annealing at 800 °C, which is consistent
with literature reports.7,64 A small band at 1450
cm–1 is slightly distinguished but not very obvious
which might be the result of transpolyacetylene.59 The oxygen level related to the O–H group (1640
cm–1) on the surface is relatively reduced by post
treatment. These findings in Raman measurement are consistent with
the results of XPS and FTIR.

From the abovementioned observations,
it is obvious that annealing UDD could result in desorption of surface
elemental contents such as carbon, oxygen, and their bonding nature
(π or σ) which leads to the transformation/reconstruction
of the surface. It was found that these phenomena are mostly derived
by the amorphous/sp2 carbons present on the surface of
UDD; therefore, the obtained results were not effective on larger
size (>10 nm) NDs. However, a similar treatment was performed on
the 50 nm ND which has been slightly graphitized via annealing at
1000 °C in vacuum; the detailed process is in elsewhere.14 Reannealing of the graphitized ND at 800 °C,
a small peak is found at ∼2137 cm–1 marked
by an arrow (shown in the inset) in Figure 4a(ii), which is assigned to the isonitrile
structure.22 In this case, there is no
obvious band found for nitrile and primary/secondary amine group during
annealing. After air exposition of the reannealed sample for 24 h,
a broad band ranging from 3100–3300 cm–1 with
a distinct peak at 3228 cm–1 shown in Figure 4a(iii) is observed. The obtained
peak corresponds to the N–H stretching vibration,65 which indicates the formation of N-formyl derivative structure as found for UDD.

Figure 4 (a) FTIR spectra of 50
nm ND graphitized at 1000 °C; (i) only graphitized, (ii) sample
(i) reannealed at 800 °C in vacuum, (iii) sample (ii) exposed
in air 24 h, (b) XPS spectra of 50 ND; (i) as received/untreated,
(ii) graphitized 50 ND reannealed at 800 °C in vacuum followed
by air exposition for 24 h.

In this case, the reduced intensity of the isonitrile (2137 cm–1) compared to the UDD could be the effect of particle
size and less surface contaminants (N, sp2/amorphous carbon).
However, this peak is consistent with the effect of hydrogen attack
on isonitrile as UDD (Figure 1c(iii) at 750 °C), which may lead a saturated structure
of isonitrile and thereafter hydrolysis during air exposition. Because
of the reduced nitrogen content and effect of the particle size, the
bond related to the cyano group (−N=C:/–C≡N)
and their structural change such as saturated one at ∼2175
cm–1 might not be very obvious/observable at 800
°C in IR measurements (similar step is seen at 750 °C for
UDD). The peak of fully saturated structures could be visible at temperatures
higher than 800 °C for larger size ND [similar to UDD at 800
°C shown Figure 1c(iv)]. The XPS spectrum shown in Figure 4b(i) reveals that the as received/untreated
surface of larger size ND contains negligible amount of nitrogen.
After graphitization followed by reannealing at 800 °C, no considerable
change is observed as shown in Figure 4b(ii). It is also noted that, because of high surface
roughness and almost no C=O groups on the graphitized ND, an
unavoidable noise signal is always found in the range of water frequency
1500–1800 cm–1 (seen from the IR in Figure 4a) which could overshadow
the N–H bending vibration. As larger ND contain significantly
less/negligible amounts of sp2 or amorphous carbons on
the surface compared to smaller sizes, the surface of 50 nm diamond
has been intentionally graphitized by annealing at 1000 °C in
vacuum to create a similar surface structure of UDD.13 Using this graphitized sample, the reactions observed for
UDD have been analyzed/repeated. Similar results have been observed
for graphitized 50 nm diamond. It has been mentioned previously that
ND contains nitrogen as an impurity because of the irradiation/production
process or N–V center creation. The existence of nitrogen in
50 nm diamond is observed in XPS data. In larger ND, the crystal structure
at the near surface contains nitrogen which remains in the graphitic
structure as C–N bonds during graphitization. This carbon–nitrogen
structure is very similar to the surface carbon–nitrogen structure
of UDD. Therefore, under similar reaction conditions, they exhibit
similar results. Consequently, there has been nitrile and isonitrile
structures and primary amine formation on the surface.

Conclusions
Detailed analysis of the surface reactive profile, structural transformations,
or reconstructions of ND annealed in the range of pregraphitization
stage (Ambient-800 °C) has been demonstrated. It has been shown
that low-temperature (<500 °C) annealing UDD in vacuum results
in the formation of nitrile and isonitrile (−N=C:/–C≡N)
structures on the surface of UDD; at higher temperature, their reduction
can be possible in the presence of radical hydrogen which leads to
amine functionalization. The source of radical hydrogen is a catalytic
effect of hydrogen (H2) dissociation which also provides
C–H adsorption on UDD at low temperatures (∼500 °C).
It has also demonstrated that the hydrolysis of isonitrile is possible
which results in N-formyl derivative functionalization
on the surface of UDD. It is found that all of the phenomena observed
on the surface of UDD are driven by the presence of surface sp2/amorphous carbon which is confirmed by the graphitized larger-size
ND. The work provides a new insight into the reactive profile of DND
as well as a facile surface modification process which leads to multifunctional
surface properties, especially with maximum bioactive moieties, such
as C–H, N–H, or N–H2. It can also
be suggested that surface nitrogen (according XPS result of N 1s after
and before the treatment) is bonded in the adjacent graphitic layer
of the surface sp3-diamond lattice. Therefore, the obtained
groups related to N (such as N–H and NH2) could
provide a stable chemical termination with drugs/biomolecules/larger
chemicals for further applications.

Beyond the abovementioned
properties, the reaction dynamics on the surface of UDD annealed in
vacuum could be equally important to the interstellar study. The most
common molecules/compounds in the interstellar medium are hydrogen
(H2), water (H2O), nitrile (CN)/isonitrile (NC),
and their unconjugated structures (HCN/HNC).66,67 The interaction of those moieties results in the formation of primary/secondary
amine (CH3–NH2/CH2–NH)
and peptide bonding (R–CONH2/R–NH–CHO)
and so forth.67−71 In addition, the interaction of the cynano-derivative (CH3–CN/CH3–NC) on the surface of carbonaceous/water
medium is studied to reproduce the observed interstellar reactions
in laboratory conditions.72 Therefore,
the studied reaction dynamics on the surface of UDD (one of the presolar
grains) could be a model platform in further understanding of interstellar
phenomena.
