Microarc oxidation (MAO) coating was prepared on the
surface of the biomedical Mg–3Zn–0.2Ca alloy in a phosphate
electrolyte with varying concentrations of Na2SiO3. The morphology, cross section, chemical composition, and corrosion
resistance of the coatings were characterized by scanning electron
microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), X-ray
diffraction (XRD), electrochemical polarization tests (EI), and in
vitro immersion experiments. The addition of Na2SiO3 is performed to increase the thickness and compactness of
the coating. When the Si/P atomic ratio is approximately equal to
1 (1.5 g/L Na2SiO3), the best corrosion resistance
is achieved, while excessive addition may lead to coating defects
such as voids and microcracks, resulting in decreased corrosion resistance.
The competitive relationship between PO43– and SiO32– anions in the silicon–phosphorus
microarc oxidation-mixed electrolyte is discussed. In this study,
it was first proposed that, when Mg2SiO4 and
Mg3 (PO4)2 phase contents were approximately
the same, the synergistic improvement effect on coating corrosion
resistance was the most effective.

1 Introduction
Due to the good biocompatibility of magnesium (Mg)
and its alloys, many researchers have paid special attention to it.1,52,53 The density2,3 (1.74
g/cm3) and elastic modulus4 (44
GPa) of Mg are close to that of a natural bone. There is no stress-shielding
effect when the implant is implanted into the human body. In addition,
Mg is an essential element of the human body, and about half of the
Mg2+ ions in the human body are stored in bones.7 The corrosion products produced in the body are
also easily absorbed and metabolized by the human body.5−7 Also, Mg2+ ions have
been shown to promote the adsorption and growth of bone cells.8 Zhang et al.9 revealed
the molecular mechanism of Mg in promoting bone repair. Their work
examined the effective concentration of the Mg ion for activating
PI3K phosphorylation via TRPM7. The authors found that Mg ions promote
cell growth and survival, protecting cells against alkaline-stress-induced
cytotoxicity caused by the degradation of Mg-based alloy implants.

Although many studies have shown that magnesium alloys are the
most suitable metals for degradable implant materials,1,10−12,48 their clinical application has been limited
due to the rapid corrosion rate of magnesium alloys in humans.13

Results have shown that proper surface
treatments can effectively reduce the corrosion rate of magnesium
alloys.14 At present, electrochemical deposition,15 anodic oxidation,16 biodegradable polymer coating,17,46,54,57 chemical conversion
coating,18,55,56,59 microarc oxidation (MAO),19,47,49,58 and other surface
treatment technologies are used to improve magnesium alloy corrosion
resistance.

MAO, also known as plasma electrolytic oxidation
(PEO), is an emerging environmentally friendly technology for improving
the corrosion resistance of magnesium and its alloys. In a high-energy
electrolyte, the surface of the magnesium alloy is transformed into
a ceramic oxide coating by a large number of partially discharge sparks.20−22 In recent years, the most widely
used electrolytes in microarc oxidation of magnesium alloys are phosphate23−26 and
silicate solutions.27,28

Zeng et al.19 considered that the corrosion resistance of
the coating is mainly related to the porosity of the MAO coating.
Jia et al.29 performed microarc oxidation
treatment on a novel Mg–1Ca alloy in KF–silicate, KF–phosphate,
and KF–silicate–phosphate electrolytes, and MTT assays
analyzing in vitro toxicity against MG63 cells were subsequently carried
out. It was found that the coatings prepared in the silicate and silicon-phosphorus-mixed
electrolytes were thicker and more porous, but the microporous depth
of the coating prepared in the silicon–phosphorus-mixed electrolyte
was small. The coating prepared in the phosphate electrolyte was denser,
and the cell survival rate was higher, thereby improving biosafety.
Ghasemi et al.31 found that SiO32– is more conducive than PO43– to the growth rate of MAO coatings by studying the effects of different
ions on the microarc oxidation process and corrosion resistance of
coatings in different electrolytes. In their study, the surface of
the coating obtained from the silicate electrolyte had larger micropores
than the phosphate electrolyte coating.

Mori et al.30 conducted microarc oxidation treatment on the
AZ31B alloy in the mixed electrolyte with different concentration
ratios of phosphate and silicate. Corrosion resistance analysis found
the coating with the best corrosion resistance in the silicon–phosphorus-mixed
electrolyte had a phosphate ratio of about 20% (P/Si = 20:80). Gao
et al.34 performed MAO treatment on the
AZ31B alloy in different silicate electrolytes with a Na2SiO3 concentration. The bond strength of the coating was
shown to gradually decrease with the increase in the Na2SiO3 concentration in the electrolyte. The optimal concentration
of Na2SiO3 in the phosphorous–silicon-mixed
electrolyte requires a balance ratio of phosphate and silicate and
may be different for magnesium alloys with different components. Chen
et al.38 argued that the presence of Si-containing
phases could improve the bioactivity of the MAO coating.

Although
various studies have been carried out on the influence of different
electrolyte compositions of magnesium alloy microarc oxidation,31−33 most applications are not in
the field of biomaterials. Therefore, no reports on the use of Na2SiO3 as a trace additive in phosphate electrolytes
have been published. In phosphate solution, it is easier to obtain
a more dense coating with higher a cell survival rate and better biosafety,29 but the wear resistance is poor.26 This study systematically describes the role
of trace amounts of Na2SiO3 in electrolytes,
with a primary focus on the effect of the Si/P atomic ratio on corrosion
resistance in coatings. Concentrate on the synergistic effect of phosphate
and silicates on the formation of MAO coating.
Other studies have not focused on the effect of the Si/P atomic ratio
on corrosion resistance.

In this study, the biomedical Mg–3Zn–0.2Ca
alloy was treated with MAO in the phosphate electrolyte with different
concentrations of Na2SiO3. Na2SiO3 is added to improve the growth rate and31 coating thickness and to increase the hardness and wear
resistance of the coating. Also, the phase composition, microstructure,
and corrosion resistance of the coating in the simulated body fluid
were studied.

2 Materials and Experimental Method
2.1 Material and Sample Pretreatment
In a vacuum melting furnace, the Mg–Zn–Ca alloy was
smelted at 700 °C under argon. The alloy composition was 3.0
wt % Zn, 0.2 wt % Ca, and the balance was Mg. After the alloy ingot
was homogenized at 350 °C for 24 h, extruded into a Φ 8
rod at 300 °C by a YQ 32-315 extruder, and the cutting for a
Φ 8 × 3 mm sample. Before the microarc oxidation (MAO)
treatment, all the samples were polished with 320#, 800#, and 1500#
SiC sandpapers, and then the sample was ultrasonically cleaned with
distilled water and acetone to remove grease and placed in a dry box.

2.2 Preparation of MAO Coating
Microarc
oxidation treatment was performed using a 50 kW pulse power source
(Chengdu Tongchuang Electric Equipment Co., Ltd.). Taking the Mg–3Zn–0.2Ca
alloy sample as an anode and the stainless steel plate as a cathode
inside an electrolyte containing Na3PO4·12H2O, NaOH, and Na2SiO3. Electrolyte compositions
are shown in Table 1. The sample was subjected to microarc oxidation treatment under
conditions of a positive voltage of 400 V, a negative voltage of 20
V, a frequency of 600 Hz, and a duty ratio of 30% for 15 min. Then,
the sample was taken out, ultrasonically cleaned with distilled water
and ethanol, and put into a dry box for drying.

M2	12	0.5	6	30	
M3	12	1	6	30	
M4	12	1.5	6	30	
M5	12	2	6	30	
2.3 Microstructure Characterization
A
field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM, JOEL 6700F, Japan)
and an energy-dispersive X-ray energy spectrometer (EDS) were used
to characterize the microstructures, thicknesses, and elemental distributions
of the samples. The phase composition of the coated sample was analyzed
by an X-ray diffractometer (XRD, Rigaku D/max/2500 pc, Japan) using
Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.154 nm) with a small angle mode,
scanning from 10 to 80° at a speed of 5°/min.

2.4 Electrochemical Test
Electrochemical
testing was performed using a Zennium electrochemical workstation
(Germany) in the simulated body fluid (SBF) (2.2683 g·L–1 NaHCO3, 0.3676 g·L–1 CaCl2·2H2O, 0.2681 g·L–1 0.3728 g·L–1 KCl, Na2HPO4, 6.5453 g·L–1 NaCl, 0.026 g·L–1 NaH2PO4, 0.1 g·L–1 Na2SO4, 6.057 g·L–1 (CH2OH)3CNH2). Electrochemical testing was
performed in a three-electrode system. The MAO-coated samples (working
area: 0.503 cm2) were the working electrodes, the counter
electrode was graphite, and the reference was a saturated calomel
electrode (SCE). The samples were tested immediately after immersion
for 30 min in SBF. The potential polarization test was performed at
a scan rate of 1 mV/s. By using the Tafel extrapolation method39,40 (Zview software 3.1) to fit the Tafel curve, corrosion potential
(Ecorr), and corrosion current density
(Icorr) were obtained. The results are
derived from the average of three samples per group.

The corrosion
rate (Pi) is proportional to the corrosion
current density (Icorr) and is calculated
according to the following equation:41,42 1  

The polarization resistance
(Rp) is inversely proportional to the
corrosion current density (Icorr) and
is calculated using the formula:43 2  

Matthews et al.19,44 estimated the conductive porosity (F) of the coating
based on the empirical equation and complementary equation. The total
porosity (F) of the coating can be determined according
to eq 3: 3  where F is
the total porosity of the coating, Rpm is the polarization resistance of the substrate, Rp is the polarization resistance of the coating, Ecorr is the corrosion potential difference between
the coating and the substrate, βa is the anode Tafel
slope of the matrix alloy, and βc is the cathode
Tafel slope of the matrix alloy.

2.5 Immersion Test
To test the degradation
of different coated samples in vitro, the immersion experiment was
conducted in SBF of 37 ± 0.5 °C and pH = 7.4, and the ratio
of immersion was 35.5 mL/cm2. After soaking for 1, 3, 7,
and 14 days in the SBF solution, the sample was taken out of the SBF
solution, rinsed with distilled water, and dried in a dry box. After
the immersion, the corrosion products on the surface of the sample
were removed with chromic acid solution (5 g K2Cr2O7 + 10 mL H2O + 90 mL H2SO4), then rinsed with distilled water and absolute ethyl alcohol,
and dried in a dry box. A stereomicroscope (LCM, OLS 4000, Olympus,
Japan) was used to observe the sample morphology immersed in SBF solution
for different days. The corrosion rate was calculated from the weight
loss using the following equation: 4  where CRavg is the average corrosion rate, A is the
surface area exposed to SBF, ρ is the
density of alloy (≈1.74 g/cm3), t is the immersion time, and W0–W1 is the weight loss.

In addition, the
pH of the SBF solution was measured with a digital pH meter (STARTER
3100, OHOUS), and all tests were performed on three parallel samples
to determine their repeatability.

3 Results
3.1 Characterization
Figure 1 shows the XRD patterns of
M1, M2, M3, M4, and M5 samples after microarc oxidation treatment.
The XRD patterns of M1 coating prepared from a single phosphate electrolyte
shows multiple diffraction peaks of MgO and Mg3(PO4)2 and a broad dispersion peak at 2θ = 15–25°,
indicating Mg3(PO4)2 formed in the
M1 coating did not completely crystallize in the microarc oxidation
process and most Mg3(PO4)2 exists
in the amorphous form. This is consistent with the results of Mori
et al.30 Their work concluded that amorphous
Mg3(PO4)2 exists in MAO coating obtained
from the phosphate electrolyte, which plays an important role in improving
the corrosion resistance of the coating. The broad dispersion peak
disappeared in the XRD patterns of the M2–M5 coatings, which
were formed in mixed electrolytes of phosphate and silicate. The M2,
M3, M4, and M5 coatings contained crystalline Mg3(PO4)2, MgO, Mg2SiO4, and possibly
amorphous Mg3(PO4)2. The XRD patterns
of M4- and M5-coated samples showed diffraction peaks of Mg2SiO4 at 2θ = 34.36° and 48.09°. With the
increase with Na2SiO3 in the electrolyte, the
number of diffraction peaks of Mg3(PO4)2 in the coating gradually decreased, the relative content
of Mg2SiO4 increased, and the content of amorphous
phase Mg3(PO4)2 may decrease. Therefore,
the dispersion broad peak caused by the amorphous phase Mg3(PO4)2 is not shown in the XRD pattern of M4
and M5 coating samples.

Figure 1 Grazing incidence XRD patterns of M1-, M2-, M3-, M4-,
and M5-coated samples.

Morphologies of the M1–M5-coated
samples are shown in Figure 2. All sample surfaces are porous. The surface of the M1 coating
prepared in the phosphate electrolyte is distributed with pores of
different sizes, with a maximum diameter of 4–5 μm. With
the addition of Na2SiO3 in the electrolyte (M2–M5),
the distribution of micropores became more uniform and the pore diameter
gradually decreased. When the concentration of Na2SiO3 reached 2 g/L (M5), the surface coating showed cracking and
the diameter of micropores increased. The cracks were generated by
the thermal stress between molten oxide and cold electrolytes.30

Figure 2 (A) Morphology of M1, (B) M2, (C) M3, (D) M4, (E) M5 MAO-coated
samples and (F) Si/P atomic ratio in the coatings and electrolytes.

The phase of the coating depends on the
composition of the electrolyte. As can be seen from Table 2, the M1 coating was composed
of Mg, O, and P elements, and the M2–M5 coatings were composed
of Mg, O, P, and Si elements. The Si/P atomic ratios of the M1–M5
coatings were 0:3.88, 1.38:3.65, 2.62:3.45, 3.88:3.22, and 5.16:3.02,
respectively. With the increase with Na2SiO3 in the electrolyte, the content of silicon in the coating gradually
increased, the content of phosphorus gradually decreased, and the
Si/P atomic ratio continuously increased. As shown in Figure 2F, the increase in the Si/P
atomic ratio in the coating was significantly greater than that in
the electrolyte. It indicates that there is a competition between
PO43– and SiO32– in the electrolyte during the formation of the coating and the reaction
rate of Mg2+ and SiO32– is
faster than that of PO43–.

No break
point between the coating and the substrate can be seen from the cross-sectional
morphology indicating that the coating has good adhesion (Figure 3). As the concentration
of Na2SiO3 in the electrolyte increased, the
thickness of the coating gradually increased, becoming more dense
and uniform. Similarly, the coating growth rate accelerated as the
concentration of Na2SiO3 in the electrolyte
increased (Figure 4). When the concentration of Na2SiO3 in the
electrolyte was 2 g/L (M5), the thickness and growth rate of the coating
showed a significant decline. Moreover, the micropore size increased,
and the continuity decreased. Different growth rates may be caused
by the difference in the reactivity of Mg2+ with PO43– and SiO32– ions.28 This indicates that adding an
appropriate amount of Na2SiO3 to the phosphate
electrolyte has the effect of promoting coating growth up to a point.
The EDS elemental analysis (Figure 3) shows the M1 coating was mainly composed of a homogeneous
distribution of Mg, O, and P, indicating the MgO and Mg3(PO4)2 phases in the coating may grow simultaneously.
The M2–M5 coatings were composed of a homogeneous distribution
of Mg, O, P, and Si, indicating the SiO32– ion participates in the formation of the coating, and the Mg2SiO4, MgO, and Mg3(PO4)2 may be growing at the same time.

3.2 Electrochemical Polarization Testing (EI)
The dynamic potential polarization curves of the M1–M5-coated
samples are shown in Figure 5. The relevant electrochemical analysis results obtained from
the electrodynamic polarization curves are shown in Table 3. The Mg alloy had a low corrosion
potential (−1749 mV) and high corrosion current density (84.9
μA/cm2). After microarc oxidation treatment, the
corrosion potential shifted to approximately 86 mV and the corrosion
current density decreased to 7.28 μA/cm2. The high
corrosion potential and low corrosion current density indicate that
the corrosion resistance of the substrate improved after the microarc
oxidation treatment. Increasing the Na2SiO3 concentration
in the electrolyte increased the corrosion potential and decreased
the corrosion current density. At 1.5 g/L Na2SiO3, the coating had the highest corrosion potential (−1550 mV),
the minimum corrosion current density (2.38 μA/cm2), and the maximum polarization resistance (12.93 kΩ cm2). The porosity and corrosion rate of this coating were minimized
and are nearly 3 times smaller than that of the coating without Na2SiO3 (M1).

and M1–M5-coated samples.

The MAO coating formed on the
surface of the substrate impedes the penetration of the corrosive
medium into the substrate, and the corrosion resistance is improved.
The cross-sectional morphology of the coating (Figure 3) shows a uniform and dense coating. This
uniform and dense structure can effectively reduce diffusion of the
corrosive medium into the substrate, thereby reducing the corrosion
rate of the alloy. In general, the corrosion of the substrate by corrosive
ions occurs via defects, micropores, and cracks in the coating, and
the coating porosity can be used for qualitative evaluation of the
corrosion resistance of the coating. The 1.5 g/L Na2SiO3 electrolyte sample (M4) had the lowest coating porosity,
in agreement with SEM results (Figure 2). When the Na2SiO3 concentration
reached 2.0 g/L (M5), the polarization resistance, compactness, and
thickness of the coating decreased and the corrosive medium is more
likely to contact the magnesium matrix.

3.3 Degradation of Coatings In Vitro
Figure 6 shows the
corrosion morphology of the bare Mg alloy and MAO-treated samples.
The bare Mg alloy (Figure 6A) shows the most severe corrosion damage, the surface is
covered with etch pits with different depths and the edges are detached.
The size and number of corrosion pits on the surface of M1–M5
MAO-coated samples were significantly reduced. Among them, the surface
of M1 (Figure 6B) is
relatively rough, and a large area of corrosion occurs. However, the
degree of corrosion shedding at the edge of the sample is significantly
reduced compared with that of the bare Mg alloy. The surface distribution
of the uniform area of corrosion pits of the sample decreased by adding
Na2SiO3 into the electrolyte. After immersion
in SBF, the area and number of corrosion pits were gradually reduced
and the edge of the sample was more complete. The M4 and M5 coatings
(Figure 6E,F) remained
relatively intact, and fewer corrosion pits were observed. The corrosion
occurs preferentially near the micropores on the surface of the sample,
and the corrosive medium contacts the substrate along the extending
direction of the micropores to form a pitting morphology. The M4 coating
had more uniform corrosion and a less corrosion pit distribution corrosion
surface. Cracks appeared on the surface of the M5-coated sample allowing
the corrosive medium to pass through the coating to the substrate.

Figure 6 (A) Morphology of the bare Mg alloy and (B–F) M1–M5-coated
samples immersed in SBF for 168 h after removing the corrosion product.

Figure 7 shows the
pH curve of SBF with samples immersed up to 14 days. Studies have
shown that pH changes are related to the corrosion resistance of magnesium
alloys.45 Bare Mg alloy reacts violently
with SBF, and the alkalinity of the solution increased significantly.
The pH value reached 8.77 after 4 days of immersion indicating a large
amount of Mg(OH)2 alkaline corrosion product was generated
on the surface of the sample. This produced a protective effect on
the Mg alloy allowing the pH value to increase slowly reaching 9.47
after 14 days.

Figure 7 pH value of bare Mg alloy and M1–M5-coated samples
immersed in SBF at 37 °C for different times (mean ± SD, n = 3).

The porous structure of the MAO coating makes
the corrosive medium easy to infiltrate; therefore, a more dense coating
produces better corrosion resistance. With the increase with Na2SiO3 in the electrolyte, the increase in the pH
value in SBF at the initial stage of immersion was significantly reduced,
which further proved that the density of the coating from M1 to M4
was indeed increased, which had a strong protective effect on the
substrate. As the porosity of the M5 coating increased, the protective
effect on the substrate decreased. After immersion for 1 day, the
pH increase of all coated samples slowed. After 14 days of immersion,
the pH of the M1 coating (0 g/L Na2SiO3) reached
8.96 and the pH of the M4 coating (1.5 g/L Na2SiO3) was 8.13. The M4 coating had the best corrosion resistance base
on the pH curve, consistent with electrochemical data.

The weight
loss and the average corrosion rate of the bare Mg alloy and M1–M5
MAO-coated samples during in vitro immersion are shown in Figure 8. The weight loss
of all the samples increased rapidly within 5 days and then slowed
due to the formation of surface corrosion products. After immersion
for 14 days, the weight loss (0.095 ± 0.003 g) and corrosion
rate (8.04 ± 0. 24 mm/year) of the bare alloy were higher than
that of MAO-coated samples. MAO treatment slowed the weight loss and
corrosion rate, producing a protective effect on the coating. With
the increase with the Na2SiO3 concentration
in the electrolyte, the weight loss and corrosion rate gradually decreased.
At 1.5 g/L Na2SiO3 (M4 coating), the minimum
weight loss (0.017 ± 0.001 g) and corrosion rate (1.44 ±
0.13 mm/year) were nearly 6 times smaller than the bare Mg alloy.

Mg alloy and M1–M5-coated samples after immersion in SBF (mean
± SD, n = 3).

4 Discussion
4.1 Effect of Na2SiO3 Concentration
on MAO Coating Phase
The XRD results (Figure 1) show SiO32– and PO43– ions in the electrolyte participate
in the formation of MAO coating and form Mg2SiO4 and Mg3(PO4)2 phases in the coating.
The formation of phases in the coating is based on the following reactions.30,34,35,63,64 5   6   7   8   9   10  

Under high voltage
conditions, the magnesium matrix and oxygen ions in the electrolyte
are converted to Mg2+ and O2– ions, respectively.
Due to the presence of an electric field,36,60,63 Mg2+ migrates outward from the
magnesium matrix to the discharge channel and O2– migrates inward from the electrolyte to the discharge channel to
form MgO, as shown in eqs 5 and 6. Mg3(PO4)2 is formed at high temperatures25 from Mg2+ migrating outward from the substrate to the
discharge channel and PO43– migrating
inward from the electrolyte to the discharge channel, as shown in
the eq 7. Mg2SiO4 is formed by the plasma chemical oxidation reaction
between the magnesium substrate and electrolyte37,38,61 in the discharge channel, as shown in eqs 8, 9, and 10.

4.2 Coating Growth Process in the Silicon–Phosphorus-Mixed
Electrolyte Solution
The Mg2SiO4, MgO,
and Mg3(PO4)2 phases are the main
components of the coating obtained from the mixed electrolyte of silicon
and phosphorus, and these phases may be grown simultaneously. The
reaction mechanism of MgO and Mg3(PO4)2 is shown in eqs 6 and 7. Mg2SiO4 is formed by the
plasma chemical oxidation reaction between the substrate and electrolyte45,60−63 in the discharge channel, as shown in eqs 8, 9, and 10. As shown in Figure 2, the addition of an appropriate amount of
Na2SiO3 to the phosphate electrolyte promotes
coating growth and increases the compactness of the coating. With
the increase in Na2SiO3 concentration in the
electrolyte, the Si element content in the coating increased gradually,
while the content of the P element decreased gradually, and the Si/P
atomic ratio increased continuously. This indicates that there is
a competitive relationship between PO43– and SiO32– anions in the electrolyte
during the formation of the coating. As shown in Figure 9B, both the PO43– and SiO32– ions react
with Mg2+ obtained by substrate ionization in the silicon–phosphorus-mixed
electrolyte. Under the same electrical parameters, the amount of substrate
Mg2+ ionization is constant. Therefore, the concentration
of PO43– and SiO32– in the mixed electrolyte becomes the main factor in components of
the coating.

Figure 9 (A) Schematic diagram of MAO coating growth of magnesium
alloy in phosphate electrolyte and (B) silicon-phosphorus-mixed electrolyte.

Table 2 shows the Si/P atomic ratios of M1–M5 coatings were
0:3.88, 1.38:3.65, 2.62:3.45, 3.88:3.22, and 5.16:3.02, respectively.
When the coating has a Si/P atomic ratio of 3.88:3.22 (approximately
equal to 1), the M4-coated sample has the fastest growth rate. The
content of P in the M1–M3 coating is higher than that of Si.
In the formation of the coating, it is possible to promote the formation
of the coating by using Na3PO4. As the concentration
of Na2SiO3 increases, more SiO32– ions participate in the coating formation process.
At the same electrical parameters, SiO32– and PO43– ions will compete to form
compounds. In the M4 and M5 MAO coatings, the Si content is higher
than that of P. Although only a small amount of Na2SiO3 was added to the electrolyte, the content of the Si element
in the M4 and M5 coatings was higher than that of the P element. It
may be that the ability of the SiO32– ion to form a compound with Mg2+ is stronger than that
of the PO43– ion. During the formation
of the M5 coating, Na2SiO3 became the main coating
formation promotion agent, which forms a competitive relationship
with Na3PO4, resulting in a decrease in the
coating density and thickness (Figure 3). Therefore, the best concentration addition of Na2SiO3 plays a role in improving the density and
thickness of the coating.

The micropores of the coating prepared
in the silicate electrolyte are a single structure, while the micropores
of the coating in the phosphate electrolyte are interconnected structures.
With the increase in the Na2SiO3 concentration
in the electrolyte, the SiO32– ion gradually
plays a role in the coating forming process, which changes the microporous
structure of the coating. As shown in Figure 2, the coating gradually changes from an interconnected
microporous structure to a single structure, which reduces the porosity
of the coating and improves the compactness and corrosion resistance
of the coating.

4.3 Corrosion Resistance Mechanism of Coatings
Mori et al.30 concluded that the corrosion
resistance of coating generated in the phosphate electrolyte is the
result of the amorphous Mg3(PO4)2 phase spontaneously transforming into Mg3(PO4)2·22H2O in solution with a self-repair
mechanism. Liang et al.26 compared the
corrosion resistance of the two coatings. The first consisted of MgO
and Mg2SiO4, and the second was MgO. Their results
showed the coating containing Mg2SiO4 had good
corrosion resistance. In this study, the corrosion resistant phases
in the coating prepared by the silicon–phosphorus-mixed solution
may be amorphous Mg3(PO4)2 and Mg2SiO4 phases. Other researchers also believe that
Mg2SiO447,50 and Mg3(PO4)251 play a beneficial
role in improving the corrosion resistance of MAO coating. Adding
an appropriate amount of Na2SiO3 can increase
the thickness and compactness of the coating, while excessive addition
may lead to coating defects such as voids and microcracks.

According
to electrodynamic polarization and in vitro immersion tests, the formation
of Mg2SiO4 and Mg3(PO4)2 in MAO coating improves the corrosion resistance of
the coating, the corrosion resistance increased and then decreased
with increasing concentrations of Na2SiO3. When
the Na2SiO3 concentration was 1.5 g/L (M4),
the coating was the most thick and dense, and the corrosion resistance
was maximized. The Si/P atomic ratio, the ratio of Mg3(PO4)2 to Mg2SiO4 of the M4 coating,
was about 1. According to different corrosion resistance mechanisms,
Mg3(PO4)2 to Mg2SiO4 synergistically enhance the corrosion resistance of the substrate.
If the concentration of Na2SiO3 continues to
increase, the Si/P atomic ratio increases, the coating thickness decreases,
and microcracks were observed. As the amount of Mg2SiO4 in the coating increased, the amorphous Mg3(PO4)2 phase decreased, and the corrosion resistance
may decrease. Therefore, when Si/P atomic ratio in the coating is
approximately equal to 1, it has the best corrosion resistance.

5 Conclusions
MAO coatings on the Mg
alloy were prepared in the phosphorous electrolyte with various concentrations
of Na2SiO3. The coatings were composed of Mg3(PO4)2, MgO, and Mg2SiO4. Increasing the concentration of Na2SiO3 in the electrolyte increased the content of silicon and decreased
the content of phosphorus. The atomic ratio of Si/P increased with
increasing Na2SiO3 concentrations, indicating
a competitive relationship between PO43– and SiO32– anions in the electrolyte
during the formation of the MAO coating. In 1.5 g/L Na2SiO3 electrolyte, the Si/P atomic ratio in the coating
was approximately equal to 1, and the coating was uniform and compact.
This sample also demonstrated the fastest growth rate and the best
corrosion resistance, which contributes to the clinical application
of magnesium alloys.
