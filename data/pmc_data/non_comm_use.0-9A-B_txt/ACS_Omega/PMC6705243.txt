The Maxwell–Stefan
(M–S)
formulation, that is grounded in the theory of irreversible thermodynamics,
is widely used for describing mixture diffusion in microporous crystalline
materials such as zeolites and metal–organic frameworks (MOFs).
Binary mixture diffusion is characterized by a set of three M–S
diffusivities: Đ1, Đ2, and Đ12. The M–S
diffusivities Đ1 and Đ2 characterize interactions of guest molecules with pore
walls. The exchange coefficient Đ12 quantifies correlation effects that result in slowing-down of the
more mobile species due to correlated molecular jumps with tardier
partners. The primary objective of this article is to develop a methodology
for estimating Đ1, Đ2, and Đ12 using input
data for the constituent unary systems. The dependence of the unary
diffusivities Đ1 and Đ2 on the pore occupancy, θ, is quantified using
the quasi-chemical theory that accounts for repulsive, or attractive,
forces experienced by a guest molecule with the nearest neighbors.
For binary mixtures, the same occupancy dependence of Đ1 and Đ2 is assumed
to hold; in this case, the occupancy, θ, is calculated using
the ideal adsorbed solution theory. The exchange coefficient Đ12 is estimated from the data on unary
self-diffusivities. The developed estimation methodology is validated
using a large data set of M–S diffusivities determined from
molecular dynamics simulations for a wide variety of binary mixtures
(H2/CO2, Ne/CO2, CH4/CO2, CO2/N2, H2/CH4, H2/Ar, CH4/Ar, Ne/Ar, CH4/C2H6, CH4/C3H8,
and C2H6/C3H8) in zeolites
(MFI, BEA, ISV, FAU, NaY, NaX, LTA, CHA, and DDR) and MOFs (IRMOF-1,
CuBTC, and MgMOF-74).

1 Introduction
Many separation and reaction processes use
microporous crystalline materials such as zeolites (alumino-silicates),
metal–organic frameworks (MOFs), and zeolitic imidazolate frameworks
(ZIFs) as perm-selective membrane layers, adsorbents, or catalysts.1−8 Separation of nitrogen/oxygen,
nitrogen/methane, and propene/propane mixtures in adsorbers packed
with LTA-4A, CHA, or ZIF-8 are essentially driven by differences in
the pore diffusivities of the guest constituents.9−16 The conversion and selectivity
of several heterogeneous catalytic reactions are influenced by intraparticle
transport of reactants and products.17−19 Pore diffusion characteristics
have a significant
influence on membrane separation selectivities.4,20−25

Mixture diffusion in microporous materials is characterized
by the fact that the mobility of any guest constituent is influenced
by its partner species;20,26 the proper modeling
of such influences is essential for process development and design.6,15 It is a common practice to model n-component mixture diffusion by
adopting the Maxwell–Stefan (M–S) formulation,1,6,7,27,28 that has its foundations in the theory of
nonequilibrium thermodynamics. The dependence of the intracrystalline
molar fluxes, Ni, on
the chemical potential gradients is written in the following form 1  

In eq 1, R is the gas
constant, ρ represents the material framework
density, and the component loadings, and qi are defined in terms of moles per kg of framework
material. The xi in eq 1 is the mole fractions
of the adsorbed phase components 2  

Two distinct
sets of M–S diffusivities are defined
by eq 1, that is phenomenological
in nature.29 The Đi characterize interactions between species i with the pore walls. As established in earlier works,23,28 the important advantage of the M–S formulation is that the Đi can be identified with
the corresponding unary diffusivities, provided the diffusivity data
are compared at the same adsorption potential, πA/RT, where A represents the surface
area per kg of framework material, and π is the spreading pressure,
defined by the Gibbs adsorption equation3,30,31 3  

The ideal
adsorbed solution theory (IAST) of Myers and Prausnitz32 enables the calculation of the adsorption potential,
πA/RT;23,28 details
are provided in the Supporting Information.

As illustration, Figure 1 presents plots of the transport coefficients, ρĐi/δ, of CO2, CH4, N2, and H2 determined
for unary and equimolar binary (CO2/H2, CO2/CH4, CO2/N2, CH4/Ar, CH4/N2, CH4/H2,
and N2/H2) mixture permeation across a SAPO-34
membrane of thickness δ.23,25,33,34 SAPO-34 has the same structural
topology as CHA zeolite, consisting of cages of volume 316 Å3, separated by 8-ring windows of 3.8 × 4.2 Å size.23 Compared at the same value of πA/RT, the magnitude of ρĐi/δ for a binary mixture is comparable
to that for the corresponding pure component. Also noteworthy, from
the data in Figure 1 is that the dependence of ρĐi/δ on πA/RT is distinctly different for each guest molecule.

Figure 1 Experimental data of
Li et al.25,33,34 for transport
coefficients ρĐi/δ of (a) CO2, (b)
CH4, (c) N2, and (d) H2 determined
for unary and equimolar binary CO2/H2, CO2/CH4, CO2/N2, CH4/Ar, CH4/N2, CH4/H2,
and N2/H2 mixture permeation across SAPO-34
membrane at 295 K. The data are plotted as a function of the adsorption
potential, πA/RT, calculated
for conditions prevailing at the upstream face of the membrane; the
calculation details are provided in an earlier work.23

The exchange
coefficients, Đij, defined by the first right member of eq 1 reflect how the facility for transport of
species i correlates with that of species j. The Onsager reciprocal relations impose the symmetry
constraint 4  

The magnitude of Đi relative to that of Đij determines the extent to which the
flux of species i is influenced by the chemical potential
gradient of species j. The larger the degree of correlations, Đi/Đij, the stronger is the influence of
diffusional “coupling”.
Generally speaking, the more strongly adsorbed tardier partner species
will have the effect of slowing down the less strongly adsorbed more
mobile partner in the mixture.

For estimation of the exchange
coefficient, Đij, the following interpolation formula has been suggested in the literature.28,35 5  where
the Đii and Đjj represent the self-exchange
coefficients, that
are accessible from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of self-diffusivities
for the constituent unary systems,26 as
will be discussed in a subsequent section. Equation 5 is essentially an adaptation of the interpolation
formula for estimation of the M–S diffusivity for binary fluid
mixtures.36

Specifically, for a binary
mixture, that is n = 2, the M–S eq 1 can be rewritten to evaluate the
fluxes Ni explicitly
by defining a 2 × 2 dimensional square matrix [Λ] 6  

The elements of [Λ]
are directly accessible from MD
simulations28,35,37,38 by monitoring the individual molecular displacements 7  

In 7ni and nj represent the number of molecules of
species i and j, respectively, and rl,i(t) is the position of molecule l of species i at any time t.

Combining eq 1 with eq 6, the following explicit expression for calculation
of the elements of the 2 × 2 dimensional square matrix [Λ]
can be derived 8  

The primary
objective of this article is to seek validation of the predictive
capability of the Maxwell–Stefan formulation by comparing each
of the four elements, Λij, determined
from MD simulations using eq 7, with the estimations using eqs 5 and 8; the required data inputs
for Đ1, Đ2, Đ11, and Đ22 are determined from MD simulations
for the constituent pure components. To meet the stated objective,
use is made of the MD simulation data base compiled in an earlier
work28 for a variety of binary mixtures
(H2/CO2, Ne/CO2, CH4/CO2, CO2/N2, H2/CH4, H2/Ar, CH4/Ar, Ne/Ar, CH4/C2H6, CH4/C3H8,
and C2H6/C3H8) in different
host materials. The host materials were chosen to represent a variety
of pore sizes, topologies, and connectivities: one-dimensional (1D)
channels (e.g., AFI, MgMOF-74), intersecting channels (MFI, BEA, ISV),
cages separated by narrow windows (LTA, CHA, DDR), cavities with large
windows (FAU, NaY, NaX, IRMOF-1, CuBTC). The Supporting Information provides structural details for all of the host
materials considered in this article.

2 Results
and Discussions
2.1 Occupancy Dependence of
Unary Diffusivities
For any guest molecule, the loading dependence
of Đi is strongly
influenced also by the
pore topology and connectivity and molecule–molecule interactions.7,8,23,28,39−43 As an illustration, Figure 2a,b presents data on Đi for the guest species CH4 in a variety
of host structures, determined from MD simulations of molecular displacements
using the following formula in each of the coordinate direction 9  

Figure 2 MD simulations
of (a,b) Maxwell–Stefan
diffusivity, Đi, (c) self-diffusivities Di,self, and (d) degree of correlations, Đi/Đii for CH4 in a variety of
host structures plotted as a function of the occupancy, θ, determined
from eq 10, where qsat and π are determined from the unary
isotherm fits that are specified in the Supporting Information accompanying this article.

The M–S diffusivity, Đi displays a wide variety
of dependencies on the fractional occupancy, θ, that serves
as a convenient and practical proxy for the adsorption potential 10  where qsat is the saturation
capacity.23,28 The calculations of the adsorption potential
in eq 10 use dual-site
Langmuir–Freundlich
fits of the unary isotherms that are determined from configurational-bias
Monte Carlo (CBMC) simulations44−48 for
each guest/host combination; details are provided in the Supporting Information.

For CH4/BEA and CH4/NaX, the Đi appears to decrease almost linearly with occupancy
θ till pore saturation conditions, θ = 1, are reached.
An appropriate model to describe this occupancy dependence is 11  where Đi(0) is
the M–S diffusivity at “zero-loading”. Equation 11 is essentially
based on a hopping model in which one molecule at any time can jump
from one sorption site to an adjacent one, provided it is not already
occupied.23,28,49,50 Using a simple two-dimensional square lattice model,
the M–S diffusivity in the limit of vanishingly small occupancies, , where ζ = 4 is the coordination number of
the 2D array of
lattice sites, λ is the jump distance on the square lattice,
and νi(0) is the jump frequency
at vanishingly small occupancy.50

More generally, molecule–molecule interactions serve to influence
the jump frequencies by a factor that depends on the energy of interaction, w. For repulsive interactions, w > 0,
whereas for attractive interactions, w < 0. Using
the quasi-chemical approach of Reed and Ehrlich51 to quantify such interactions, the following expression
is obtained for the occupancy dependence of the M–S diffusivities50,52,53 12  

In 12 the following dimensionless
parameters are defined 13  

In the limiting case of negligible
molecule–molecule interactions, w = 0, ϕ
= 1, β = 1, eqs 12 and 13 degenerate
to yield eq 11. The
continuous solid lines in Figure 2a,b are fits of the MD simulated Đi by fitting the sets of parameters: Đi(0), and ϕ = ϕ0 exp(−aθ). For all of the guest/host
combinations, eqs 12 and 13 provide good descriptions of the occupancy
dependencies; see Figures S38–S108 of the Supporting Information.

Applying eq 1 to a binary mixture consisting of tagged
and untagged species i, that are otherwise identical,7,50,54 we can derive the following relation
between the self-diffusivity, Di,self and the M–S diffusivity, Đi 14  

The self-diffusivities, Di,self may be computed from
MD simulations by analyzing the mean square displacement of each species, i for each coordinate direction7 15  

By combination of eqs 9, 14, and 15,
we can determine the degrees of correlations
due to self-exchange, Đi/Đii. Figure 2c,d presents MD simulated
data on Di,self and Đi/Đii for CH4 in different host
materials: MgMOF-74 (1D channels of 11 Å), BEA (intersecting
channels of 6.5 Å), ISV (intersecting channels of 6.5 Å),
NaX (790 Å3 cages separated by 7.4 Å windows),
MFI (intersecting channels of 5.5 Å), and LTA (743 Å3 cages separated by 4.2 Å windows). It is also to be
noted that the size of the 1D channels of MgMOF-74 are large enough
to preclude single-file diffusion of guest molecules. The degree of
correlations is the lowest for the LTA zeolite because the guest molecules
jump one-at-a-time across the narrow 4.2 Å windows;6,55,56 the same characteristics are
valid for other cage-window structures with narrow windows, such as
CHA, DDR, and ZIF-8.24,57−59 The variation
of Đi/Đii with occupancy is practically linear,23,28 and the solid lines in Figure 2d are the linear fits 16  

Equation 16 provides
a good description of the occupancy
dependence of the degrees of correlations due to self-exchange for
all guest/host combinations; see Figures S38–S108 of the Supporting Information.

2.2 Occupancy
Dependence of [Λ] for Binary
Mixture Diffusion
Having established and quantified the occupancy
dependence of Đi and Đi/Đii for each guest/host
combination, we are in a position to compare the estimations of Λij for binary mixtures using eqs 5 and 8 with
the corresponding MD simulated values by monitoring molecular displacements
and use of eq 7; Figures S38–S108 provide detailed comparisons
for each mixture/host combination that was investigated. Figure 3 provides an illustration
of the estimation procedure for CH4(1)/C3H8(2) mixture diffusion in NaX zeolite. Figure 3a show the Reed–Ehrlich model fits
for the unary diffusivities Đ1, Đ2 for CH4 and C3H8 in NaX. The linear fits for the degrees of self-exchange Đ1/Đ11 and Đ2/Đ22 are shown in Figure 3b. In Figure 3c, the MD simulation data for Λ11, Λ12 = Λ21, and Λ22 for equimolar
(q1 = q2)
binary CH4(1)/C3H8(2) mixtures are
compared with the estimations (shown by the continuous solid lines)
using eqs 5 and 8. The Maxwell–Stefan formulation provides
very good estimates of dependence of each Λij on the occupancy θ, calculated using eq 10, wherein the saturation capacity
for the mixture is determined from 17  where q1,sat and q2,sat are the saturation capacities of components 1 and 2,
respectively. Equation 17 can be derived from the IAST, as detailed in the Supporting Information.

values
of (a) Đ1, Đ2 and (b) Đ1/Đ11, Đ2/Đ22 for guest molecules CH4 and C3H8 in NaX zeolite (86 Al) at

(86 Al) at 300 K, compared with the estimations (shown by continuous
solid lines) using eqs 5 and 8.

Similar good estimates of the
M–S model are established in Figure 4 for six other equimolar (q1 = q2) binary mixtures: CO2/H2 in MFI, CH4/C3H8 in BEA, CH4/C2H6 in NaY, CH4/CO2 in IRMOF-1, CO2/CH4 in
MgMOF-74, and Ne/Ar in CuBTC.

Λ12 = Λ21, and Λ22 for equimolar (q1 = q2) binary (a) CO2(1)/H2(2) in MFI

zeolite, (c) CH4(1)/C2H6(2) in NaY
zeolite (48 Al), (d) CH4(1)/CO2(2) in IRMOF-1,
(e) CO2(1)/CH4(2) in MgMOF-74, and (f) Ne(1)/Ar(2)
in CuBTC at 300 K, compared with the estimations (shown by continuous
solid lines) using eqs 5, and 8.

A different test of the predictive
capability of M–S formulation is to consider diffusion in binary
mixtures for which the total loading q1 + q2 is held constant, and the mole
fraction of component 1 in the adsorbed mixture, x1, is varied from 0 to 1.60 One of the earliest investigations of this type were reported by
Snurr and Kärger61 for CH4/CF4 diffusion in MFI zeolite at a total loading of 12
molecules uc–1.

Figure 5 compares the MD simulation data for Λij for binary Ne(1)/Ar(2) mixtures of varying
composition x1 in MFI, LTA, CHA, and DDR
zeolites. In all four cases, eqs 5, and 8 provide good predictions of
the variation of Λij with composition.
It is also to be noted that the off-diagonal elements Λ12 for LTA, CHA, and DDR zeolites are significantly lower,
by about an order of magnitude, than the diagonal elements, Λ11 and Λ22. For cage-type zeolites such as
LTA, CHA, DDR, ERI with 8-ring windows in the 3.3–4.5 Å
size range, the degree of correlations Đi/Đii are negligibly small because the guest molecules jump one-at-a-time
across the narrow windows.20,26−28,55,62

data for Λ11,
Λ12, and Λ22 for binary Ne(1)/Ar(2)
mixtures of varying composition at constant total loading qt = q1 + q2 in (a) MFI zeolite (qt = 12.5 molecules uc–1), (b) LTA all-silica
zeolite (qt = 60 molecules uc–1), (c) CHA all-silica zeolite (qt = 25
molecules uc–1), and (d) DDR zeolite (qt = 40 molecules uc–1) at 300 K, compared
with the estimations (shown by continuous solid lines) using eqs 5, and 8. Note that Λ21 = (x2/x1)Λ12 has not
been plotted because it is not independent.

Further evidence of the good predictive
capability of the M–S formulation is provided in Figures S38–S108.

2.3 Preferential
Perching of CO2 in
Window Regions of Cage-Type Zeolites
For separation of CO2 from gaseous mixtures containing CH4, H2, N2, Ar, or Ne, cage-type zeolites such as DDR CHA, LTA,
and ERI are of practical interest.8,24,30,31,46,47,55,56 These materials consist of cages separated
by narrow windows, in the 3.3–4.5 Å range. CBMC simulations59 show that the window regions of cage-type zeolites
have a significantly higher proportion of CO2 than within
the cages. For all four zeolites, CO2 has the highest probability,
about 30–40%, of locating at the window regions.59 The preferential perching of CO2 in
the window regions, evidenced by the computational snapshot for CHA
(see Figure 6a), has
the effect of hindering the intercage hopping of partner molecules.

snapshot
showing the preferential perching of CO2 at the window
regions of CHA zeolite.59 (b–d)

LTA all-silica zeolite, (c) CHA all-silica zeolite, and (d) DDR zeolite,
compared with the estimations (shown by continuous solid lines) using eq 8 and assuming that the
degrees of correlations are negligible, that is Đi/Đii → 0.

Figure 6b–d
compare the MD simulation data for Λ11 and Λ22 for equimolar (q1 = q2) binary CO2(1)/Ne(2) mixtures in
LTA, CHA, and DDR zeolite, with the estimations using eq 8, assuming that the degrees of correlations
are negligible, that is Đi/Đii →
0. For all three zeolites, the MD simulation data for Λ22 are significantly lower than the predictions using eq 8; the M–S formulation
does not cater for hindering effects caused due to segregated mixture
adsorption. Experimental evidence of the importance of hindering effects
is provided in published works on CO2/CH4 and
CO2/N2 mixture permeation across the DDR membrane.38,63,64 Analogous hindering effects are
also evidenced for CO2/CH4 mixture permeation
across ZIF-8 membranes.24

Preferential
location of branched alkanes and aromatics at the intersections of
MFI zeolite often cause intersection-blocking and loss of connectivity;55,65,66 this leads to failure of the
predictions of the M–S model.67

2.4 Molecular Clustering
Due to Hydrogen Bonding
For water/methanol and water/ethanol
mixture diffusion in microporous materials, molecular simulations62,68−71 demonstrate the occurrence of molecular
clustering due to hydrogen bonding. As a consequence of cluster formation,
the diffusivities of either guest molecule in the mixture is significantly
lower than the corresponding unary diffusivities. As illustration
of mutual-slowing down effects, Figure 7 presents MD data on the self-diffusivities, Di,self, in water/methanol mixtures
in CHA, DDR, and LTA zeolites, plotted as a function of the mole fraction
of water in the adsorbed phase, x1. Each
of the diffusivities is lowered due to the presence of its partner
species. Experimental evidence of mutual-slowing down effects are
available for water/alcohol permeation across CHA,72,73 H-SOD,74 and DDR71,75 membranes. Further research
is necessary to generalize the M–S formulation in a manner
that explicitly allows for cluster formation, by defining a cluster
to be a pseudospecies in the mixture.

Figure 7 MD simulations
of self-diffusivities, Di,self, of water(1)/methanol(2)
mixtures of varying composition in (a) CHA, (b) DDR, and (c) LTA zeolites,
plotted as a function of the mole fraction of water in the adsorbed
phase, x1. In the MD simulations, the
total loading, Θt, expressed as molecules uc–1, is held constant; the values Θt are specified. The MD data are culled from our previous publications.69−71

3 Conclusions
The capability of eqs 5 and 8 for the estimation of the elements of
the square matrix of M–S
diffusivities, Λij, characterizing
mixture diffusion, using input based on unary systems is tested using
a large database obtained from MD simulations for a wide variety of
guest/host combinations. The key to the estimation methodology is
that the estimates are based on comparing the mixture diffusion data
with those of the constituent unaries at the same fractional occupancy,
θ, that is calculated on the basis of the adsorption potential
using eq 10. For the
majority of binary mixtures investigated, 70 in total, summarized
in Figures S38–S108, the MD-simulated
Λij data are in good agreement with
the estimations using the M–S theory. The predictions of the
M–S formulation are found to be poor for diffusion of CO2-bearing mixture in cage-type zeolites (LTA, CHA, DDR) wherein
the preferential perching of CO2 at the window regions
hinders the intercage hopping of partner molecules. The M–S
predictions also fail to capture molecular clustering effects in water/alcohol
systems that are engendered due to hydrogen bonding.62
