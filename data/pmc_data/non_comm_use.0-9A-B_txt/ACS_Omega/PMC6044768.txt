Utilization of a
self-assembled two-dimensional DNA nanostructure
to arrange single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) into predetermined
structures at controllable angles is presented. A specially designed
DNA three-way junction (3WJ) composed of three double-stranded DNA
arms containing single-stranded overhang sequences was prepared by
annealing of partially complementary ssDNA sequences and ultrasonicated
with SWNTs, resulting in DNA-3WJ/SWNT hybrid nanostructures. Utilization
of DNA-3WJ not only allowed the precise dispersion of SWNTs but also
acted as a rigid template for the self-assembly of SWNTs into three-armed
junctions at an angle of approximately 120° to each other as
visualized by scanning electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy.
Prepared DNA-3WJ/SWNT nanostructures were also demonstrated to have
the appropriate binding sites for fluorophores, providing a simple
method for the fluorescent labeling of SWNTs. When ssDNA sequences
forming the DNA-3WJ are ultrasonicated with SWNTs, followed by annealing
of resulting ssDNA wrapped SWNTs, instead of hybrid junctions composed
of three SWNT molecules, a web-like structure composed of interconnected
SWNT junctions was obtained. The design approaches demonstrated here
provide simple methods for the arrangement of SWNTs into desired nanostructures
utilizing pre-assembled DNA nanostructures as linkers in aqueous solution
through noncovalent interactions which can greatly contribute to efforts
along the controlled assembly of SWNTs.

Introduction
Single-walled carbon
nanotubes (SWNTs) are essential building blocks
for the fabrication of nanoscale devices with potential applications
in electronics, optics, and biosensing. The main challenge in the
utilization of remarkable thermal, electrical, and electronical properties
of SWNTs in such nanoscale devices is to precisely control the assembly
of SWNTs into desired nanoarchitectures. The ability to direct the
positioning of SWNTs at the nanoscale could allow the creation of
macroscopic assemblies that parallel the distinct properties of individual
nanotubes. Several studies focused on building SWNT junctions as synthesized
on surfaces1−5 and in solution using postsynthesis methodologies.6−11 A promising approach to build controllable SWNT assemblies is the
utilization of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) as information-containing
biomolecules. ssDNA is a useful tool for materials chemistry as it
can be programmed into complex nanostructures through hybridization
and allows both covalent and noncovalent functionalization to build
hybrid materials.12,13 The fact that ssDNA can form
strong π–π interactions with SWNTs resulting in
helical wrapping makes it a useful agent that can be utilized for
SWNT dispersion, sorting, and labeling.14 Hybrids of ssDNA and SWNTs can be prepared where the ssDNA can act
as both the dispersing agent by wrapping the SWNT and also as the
linker molecule that joins SWNTs wrapped with ssDNA of complimentary
sequences through hybridization. The ability of ssDNA to direct the
self-assembly of SWNTs into controlled aggregates or two-dimensional
complex geometries in solution or on ssDNA-immobilized surfaces has
been demonstrated in a limited number of studies.15−22 On the other hand, a facile method to arrange SWNTs into controlled
nanostructures utilizing pre-assembled DNA nanostructures that link
the self-assembly of SWNTs through in-solution, noncovalent interactions
is missing.

Here, we demonstrate the utilization of a specially
designed ssDNA
three-way junction (3WJ) nanostructure to build branched SWNT building
blocks in solution. DNA 3WJ nanostructures possessing linker sequences
available for wrapping the SWNT allow the self-assembly of three individual
SWCNTs into a Y-junction. Depending on the route of preparation, these
SWNT Y-junctions can act as building blocks for the formation of larger
networks of SWNTs as well.

Results and Discussion
Preparation and Characterization
of 3WJ-DNA Nanostructures
The DNA nanostructure utilized
to link three individual SWNT molecules
into a Y-junction with a controlled angle through noncovalent binding
interactions is a DNA-3WJ. The 3WJ is formed by the self-assembly
of three ssDNA strands with partially complementary sequences through
annealing, resulting in a nanostructure with three arms consisting
of double-stranded DNA and noncomplementary overhang sequences for
wrapping the SWNT (Figure 1a). The overhang is designed to be a poly-G sequence consisting
of 13 guanines which was previously demonstrated to show a strong
affinity toward wrapping SWNTs.23 The successful
assembly of the 3WJ was demonstrated with agarose gel electrophoresis
(Figure 1b). When all
three ssDNA strands were annealed, the corresponding band migrates
slower than bands corresponding to individual strands and to the products
obtained from annealing two of the ssDNA strands using the same conditions.
This result demonstrated the successful formation of the DNA-3WJ nanostructure
which migrates slower than control products because of its larger
molecular weight.

sequences, (b) visualization of the agarose gel loaded with individual
ssDNA strands, binary combinations of ssDNA strands, and a mixture

for 5 min and cooled in an ice bath, and (c) fluorescence titration
curve demonstrating the increase in fluorescence intensity of DNA-3WJ
at increasing fluorophore concentrations.

The formation of the 3WJ nanostructure exactly as designed
was
further confirmed by measuring the number of base pairs formed by
conducting fluorophore titration experiments. Aliquots of an asymmetrical
cyanine dimer, YOYO-1, that is known to bind to DNA base pairs at
a ratio of 1:4 was titrated into a DNA-3WJ solution of a known concentration,
and the increase in fluorescence was monitored at increasing fluorophore
concentrations. Figure 1c shows that the fluorescence intensity increased with the increasing
fluorophore concentration as YOYO-1 molecules intercalate between
the base pairs of 3WJ and light up. At a certain point, the fluorescence
intensity levels off, indicating that all binding sites on the nanostructure
were saturated with the fluorophore. The fact that this saturation
occurred when the ratio of the YOYO-1 concentration to the theoretical
number of base pairs is 0.25, as expected, confirmed the formation
of the 3WJ nanostructure as designed.

Preparation and Characterization
of Hybrids of DNA-3WJ and SWNTs
To assemble SWNTs into 3WJ
nanostructures, they were ultrasonicated
in an aqueous solution of the prepared DNA-3WJ, followed by ultracentrifugation
to remove any residues that are not dispersed (Figure 2a). While SWNTs of the same concentration
were not dispersed in water using the same ultrasonication conditions,
SWNTs ultrasonicated in DNA-3WJ solution were finely dispersed, indicating
that SWNTs were noncovalently interacting with the DNA-3WJ, leading
to the formation of a hybrid nanostructure (Figure 2b). As a control experiment to confirm that
DNA-3WJ nanostructures survived the high-energy ultrasonication process,
agarose gel migration of samples before and after the ultrasonication
was compared and shown to have the same mobility, demonstrating that
the DNA-3WJ template stays intact during the ultrasonication of SWNTs
with DNA (data not shown).

Figure 2 (a) Schematic representation of the formation
of DNA-3WJ/SWNT hybrid
nanostructures and (b) photographs of SWNTs ultrasonicated in water
(left) and SWNTs ultrasonicated in DNA-3WJ solution.

The formation of DNA-3WJ/SWNT hybrid structures
was further characterized
with atomic force microscopy (AFM) and scanning electron microscopy
(SEM) to confirm that SWNTs are assembled into junctions with a controlled
angle. Figure 3a shows
representative AFM images of DNA-3WJ/SWNT hybrids. As seen on the
images, the DNA-3WJ template guided the assembly of three individual
SWNT molecules into one hybrid nanostructure, leading to three-armed
SWNTs where the angle at their junction point is approximately 120°.
The fact that the DNA-3WJ nanostructure is composed of three partially
complementary strands that form double-stranded DNA arms makes it
a rigid template that controls the angle at which the carbon nanotubes
join and form the hybrid three-armed SWNT nanostructure. Cross-sectional
AFM height analysis confirms that these Y-junction nanostructures
are actually composed of SWNTs as the height of these nanostructures
coincides with the height of individual SWNTs imaged under the same
conditions (Supporting Information Figure
S1). While Y-junctions of SWNTs were visible on the representative
AFM image, individual SWNTs were present as well, indicating that
not all SWNTs were able to self-assemble into DNA-3WJ/SWNT nanostructures.
We believe that manipulation of DNA-3WJ and SWNT concentrations along
with sonication and annealing conditions can improve the yield of
DNA-3WJ/SWNT formation. Similar to AFM images, DNA-3WJ-templated branched
SWNT nanostructures were also visible on SEM images (Figure 3b). Microscopy images obtained
confirmed that the design and the method applied in this work allowed
the DNA-3WJ-templated assembly of SWNTs into three-armed junctions.

and (b) cross-sectional analysis of representative topographical AFM
(a) and SEM (b) images of DNA-3WJ/SWNT hybrid nanostructures.

DNA-3WJ nanostructures not only
acted as templates that facilitate
the self-assembly of SWNTs into junctions, they were also shown to
provide a relatively better dispersion quality compared to linear
ssDNA strands that form the DNA-3WJ. We utilized agarose gel electrophoresis
to demonstrate the relative dispersion qualities of SWNT samples,
as improved quality of dispersion of SWNTs will decrease the particle
size and make it easier for SWNTs to enter the gel and migrate. Figure 4a shows a comparison
of migration of ssDNA3/SWNT and 3WJ/SWNT hybrids in an agarose gel.
While both hybrids entered the gel, 3WJ/SWNT hybrids migrated significantly
faster than ssDNA/SWNT hybrids on the agarose gel, indicating that
SWNTs were dispersed into smaller particle sizes in the DNA-3WJ solution
than the linear ssDNA. Dynamic light scattering (DLS) characterization
of both samples reporting the average hydrodynamic diameter of SWNTs
further confirmed that 3WJ nanostructures provided better dispersion
quality compared to a linear ssDNA (Figure 4b). The particle size of SWNTs dispersed
using the DNA 3WJ were measured to be significantly smaller than the
particle size of the same amount of SWNTs dispersed using a linear
equivalent, one of the ssDNA strands forming the DNA-3WJ. Apparently,
the dendrimeric form of the DNA-3WJ binding sites which allows one
DNA-3WJ molecule to wrap three individual SWNT molecules increases
the dispersion efficiency.

equal amounts of
ssDNA/SWNT (left) and DNA-3WJ/SWNT (right) and (b) average hydrodynamic
diameters of ssDNA/SWNT and DNA-3WJ/SWNT hybrids measured by DLS.

We further characterized DNA-3WJ/SWNT
nanostructures for their
potential for being fluorescently labeled. Fluorescent labeling of
nanoparticles provides a great variety of opportunities for the utilization
of nanoparticles in biological and sensing applications. Fluorescent
labeling of SWNTs with fluorophores has been of particular interest
because the inherent fluorescence emission of SWNTs is of very low
efficiency and is limited to the near-infrared region of the spectrum.
The main obstacle that limits the fluorescent labeling of SWNTs with
fluorophores is the fact that fluorophores in close proximity to the
SWNT surface are mostly quenched, as SWNTs act as electron and energy
acceptors.24,25 The design of DNA-3WJ/SWNT nanohybrids
reported here allows the labeling of the core DNA-3WJ with fluorophores
which results in indirect labeling of SWNTs. To investigate whether
DNA-3WJ/SWNTs can be labeled with fluorophores, we chose an asymmetric
cyanine dye, YOYO-1 which lights up when it intercalates between the
base pairs of double-stranded DNA. Figure 5 shows the fluorescence spectrum of a solution
of DNA-3WJ/SWNTs, to which a saturating amount of YOYO-1 was added.

Figure 5 Fluorescence
spectra of equal amounts of YOYO-1 (i) in water (black
squares) and (ii) bound to DNA-3WJ/SWNT (red circles).

While YOYO-1 was not fluorescent when it is free
in aqueous solution,
DNA-3WJ/SWNT nanohybrids, to which the same amount of YOYO-1 was added,
had a strong fluorescence intensity. Utilization of a DNA nanostructure
not only allowed the self-assembly of SWNTs into a controlled branched
nanostructure, it also acted as a functional group that enables the
fluorescent labeling of SWNTs.

An alternative design approach
to prepare DNA-3WJ/SWNT nanohybrids
was also investigated where individual ssDNA strands designed to form
the 3WJ were ultrasonicated with SWNTs first, followed by the annealing
of ssDNA-wrapped SWNTs (Figure 6). While we hypothesized that a similar DNA-3WJ/SWNT nanohybrid
structure may form using this postannealing preparation method, characterization
of the prepared product predicted a different nanostructure.

Figure 6 Schematic representation
of the hypothesized mechanism of formation
of DNA-3WJ/SWNT nanostructures with the postannealing method.

Prepared DNA-3WJ/SWNTs were characterized
with agarose gel electrophoresis.
While nanostructures formed by the preannealing method entered the
gel and migrated, nanostructures formed by the postannealing method
were not able to enter the gel (Figure 7a). DNA-3WJ/SWNT nanostructures prepared with the postannealing
method remained in the loading well, indicating a significantly larger
molecular weight that limits the mobility of the nanostructure within
the gel. Similarly, characterization of the average hydrodynamic diameter
of the nanostructures formed by the postannealing method predicted
a bulky structure with a diameter that is several folds larger than
the DNA-3WJ/SWNT nanohybrids formed by the preannealing method (Figure 7b). These results
indicated that the postannealing method resulted in a network of DNA-3WJ-linked
SWNTs instead of individual three-armed SWNT hybrids. Microscopic
characterization of resulting nanostructures further confirmed the
formation of such a network of SWNTs (Figure 8a,b, Supporting Information Figure S2). SWNTs, mostly self-assembled into junctions, appeared
to be interconnected to each other forming a web-like structure composed
of hexagons. When the two-dimensional planar 3WJ-SWNT nanostructures
were linked at different angles, a three-dimensional network of SWNTs
was possibly formed, as also visible on the microscopy images. A possible
mechanism of formation of this SWNT network structure is demonstrated
in Figure 8c. If multiple
ssDNA strands wrap the same SWNT through the poly-G regions during
the ultrasonication process, then SWNTs with multiple overhang sequences
can form, which will be linked into a network when the complementary
overhang sequences hybridize during the annealing step. When the preannealing
method is applied, on the other hand, the rigid and bulky nature of
the 3WJ implies a steric hindrance that prevents the wrapping of SWNTs
by multiple 3WJ nanostructures which is not the case when SWNTs are
ultrasonicated with linear ssDNA strands. Thus, we have demonstrated
that the order of addition of the ssDNA strands that form the DNA-3WJ
nanostructure and SWNTs can determine the structure of the DNA-3WJ/SWNT
nanostructures. SWNTs self-assembled into Y-junctions or into a network
composed of Y-junctions can be obtained in a controllable fashion
by applying different methods.

Conclusions
We demonstrated a simple method to prepare
self-assembled SWNT
nanostructures where three individual SWNT molecules are linked into
a junction at a controllable angle by the utilization of a two-dimensional
self-assembled DNA-3WJ nanostructure. While the DNA-3WJ was demonstrated
to be a relatively better dispersing agent than a linear ssDNA analog,
it also acted as an effective template for the arrangement of SWNTs
into a desired nanostructure. The design of the DNA-3WJ/SWNT hybrids
also allows the effective labeling of SWNTs with fluorophores. With
a slight modification of the preparation method where the order of
addition of components is changed, these SWNT junctions can be interconnected,
resulting in a web-like network of SWNTs. Methods reported here provide
an effective approach for the self-assembly of SWNTs in solution,
utilizing self-assembled DNA nanostructures and can be applied to
various other DNA nanostructures resulting in SWNT assemblies of different
structures and dimensions.

Preparation and Characterization of DNA-3WJ
To prepare
the DNA-3WJ nanostructure, an aqueous solution containing 1 μM
of each ssDNA1, ssDNA2, and ssDNA3 in a buffer (100 mM NaCl, 10 mM
Tris, and 0.1 mM EDTA) was prepared and annealed by heating to 95
°C for 5 min and cooling in an ice bath.

Visualization
of the formation of DNA-3WJ was performed by agarose gel electrophoresis.
Samples (12.5 μL) mixed with 2.5 μL 6× glycerol loading
dye were loaded into a 1% agarose gel prestained with GelRed nucleic
acid stain. The gel was run in 1× TBE buffer (89 mM tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane,
89 mM boric acid, and 2 mM EDTA in distilled water). The Bio-Rad Gel
Doc EZ system was used to visualize the gel.

The titration experiment
to confirm the formation of DNA-3WJ was
conducted on a Cary Eclipse Fluorescence Spectrophotometer. Aliquots
of 50 μM YOYO-1 solution were titrated into a solution containing
0.25 μM DNA-3WJ. The intensity at fluorescence maximum (510
nm) was monitored at increasing YOYO-1 concentrations, and the saturation
of DNA-3WJ with fluorophores was reached when the intensity levels
off.

Preparation of DNA-3WJ/SWNT Nanohybrids
To prepare
3WJ-DNA/SWNT nanohybrids with the preannealing method, a dispersal
solution composed of 0.1 mg mL–1 SWNT and 1 μM
annealed DNA-3WJ was prepared and sonicated with a microprobe (QSonica,
Q700) for 30 min at a power of 5 W with 4 s pulse on and 4 s pulse
off time in ice. The dispersion was centrifuged at 14 000 rpm
for 5 min. The black colored supernatant was removed into a clean
Eppendorf tube.

To prepare 3WJ-SWNT nanohybrids with the postannealing
method, each ssDNA was sonicated with SWNTs separately. A solution
(0.5 mL) containing 0.1 mg mL–1 CNTs and 1 μM
of each ssDNA in water was sonicated for 30 min with 4 s pulse on
and 4 s pulse off time in ice. Following the sonication, equal volumes
of all dispersion solutions were mixed and annealed by heating to
95 °C for 5 min and cooling in an ice bath. The dispersion was
centrifuged to remove the unbound SWNTs at 14 000 rpm for 5
min, and the supernatant was taken into a clean Eppendorf tube. Any
unbound ssDNA was removed using Amicon Ultra filter devices by following
the instructions of the filter device.

Characterization of 3WJ-DNA/SWNT
Nanohybrids
Atomic Force Microscopy
The supramolecular
assemblies
of DNA-3WJ/SWNT nanohybrids were characterized by AFM in a dynamic
mode (ezAFM, Nanomagnetics Instruments). To perform the experiment
on an atomically flat surface, the mica sheet was cleaved with the
scotch tape a few times. Samples were diluted 1:10 with deionized
water. Nanohybrids (20 μL) were deposited onto the freshly cleaved
mica sheet for 15 min at room temperature. Following the deposition,
the surface was rinsed with deionized water and air-dried.

Scanning
Electron Microscopy
DNA-3WJ/SWNT nanohybrids
were analyzed with a Zeiss Leo Supra 35 scanning electron microscope
using a secondary electron detector. Nanohybrids were diluted 1:10
and 1:200 with distilled water for preannealed and postannealed samples,
respectively. Nanohybrids (10 μL) were dropped onto an aluminum
SEM stub and then air-dried for 2 h. DNA-3WJ/SWCNT nanohybrids prepared
with the preannealing method were visualized at an accelerating voltage
of 4 kV and a working distance of 6 mm. DNA-3WJ/SWCNT nanohybrids
prepared with the postannealing method were visualized at an accelerating
voltage of 3 kV and a working distance of 7 mm.

Agarose Gel
Electrophoresis
Visualization of the mobility
of DNA-3WJ/SWNT nanohybrids was performed by agarose gel electrophoresis.
Samples (12.5 μL) mixed with 2.5 μL of 1:3 glycerol: water
solution were loaded into a 1% agarose gel, and the gel was run in
1× TBE. The gel was photographed without any staining.

Fluorescence
Spectroscopy
The fluorescence spectrum
of 3WJ-DNA/SWNT saturated with YOYO-1 was obtained by performing a
titration experiment. Aliquots of a 10 μM YOYO-1 solution were
titrated into a solution containing 0.25 μM 3WJ-DNA/SWNT. The
intensity at fluorescence maximum (510 nm) was monitored at increasing
YOYO-1 concentrations, and the saturation of the nanohybrid with fluorophores
was reached when the intensity levels off.

Dynamic Light
Scattering
Samples were analyzed in a
quartz cuvette at 25 °C. Nanohybrids were diluted 1:200 with
distilled water for measurements. The particle size analysis was performed
for 10 cycles with 3 measurements that were used to determine the
mean particle size.
