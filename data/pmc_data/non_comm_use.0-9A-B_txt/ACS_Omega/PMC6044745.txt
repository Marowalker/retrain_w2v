Triglycerides
in food products such as mayonnaise are a vital source
of energy and essential for a complete and healthy diet. Their molecular
structures consist of a glycerol backbone esterified with fatty acids
on the two outer and the middle positions. During the digestion of
triglycerides by pancreatic lipase in the small intestine, the ester
bonds on the outer positions are hydrolyzed, leading to amphiphilic
monoglycerides and free fatty acids as products. Depending on their
chain length and degree of saturation, these products can self-assemble
into a variety of structures in excess water. In this study, we report
the discovery of highly ordered nanostructures inside of the mayonnaise
emulsion droplets during in vitro digestion of mayonnaise under simulated
in vivo conditions using time-resolved synchrotron small-angle X-ray
scattering. The formation of these structures is most likely linked
to their function as a carrier and controlled release system for food
nutrients, especially poorly water-soluble components, in the aqueous
milieu of the digestive tract. This detailed understanding of nanostructure
formation during the digestion of triglyceride-containing food products
such as mayonnaise may have fundamental implications for the development
of foods with improved nutritional and functional properties.

==== Body
Introduction
Mayonnaise is an oil-in-water emulsion,
consisting of egg-lecithin-stabilized
oil droplets that contain up to 80% vegetable oil triglycerides. The
latter are mainly composed of unsaturated fatty acids (approximately
90% of the fatty acids).1−3 The closely packed foam of oil
droplets in mayonnaise is a vital source of nutrients and energy.
On the molecular level, triglycerides have a glycerol backbone with
ester bonds to three fatty acids at the stereochemically distinct
positions: sn-1, sn-2, and sn-3. The digestion of the triglycerides
by lipases in the human digestive tract converts these water-insoluble
molecules to more polar products for their absorption into the circulatory
system of the body.4 Pancreatic lipase
in the small intestine quantitatively transfers the triglycerides
into amphiphilic sn-2 monoglycerides and two free fatty acids.5,6 In excess water, these molecules can self-assemble into a variety
of structures including highly organized nanostructures that are in
thermodynamic equilibrium with the surrounding aqueous medium.7−10 The structure of these self-assembled systems can be modulated by
temperature and lipid composition,7,11 selected amino
acids or peptides,12,13 pH,10,14,15 and certain ions16 and can generally be described by the critical packing parameter.17

Complex colloidal systems consisting of
highly organized, self-assembled
nanostructures inside of the emulsion droplets were found during the
digestion of model triolein-based emulsions and milk.18−21 These complex systems may secure nutrient uptake and act as nanocarriers
to deliver poorly water-soluble food components such as polyunsaturated
fatty acids under compromised bile salt conditions.18,21 Similar nanostructures were also discussed as oral delivery vehicles
for poorly water-soluble bioactive food components (e.g., carotenes,
vitamins A, D, E, and K) or drugs.13,22−25 The colloidal structures that are formed during the triglyceride
digestion were reported to be highly pH responsive: Increasing the
pH in the continuous dispersion phase was found to decrease the critical
packing parameter because of charge repulsion of deprotonated oleic
acid molecules.10,15,17 In terms of variations in the interface curvature, this corresponds
to an increase in the negative curvature of the inverse structures,
and eventually significant structural alterations occur at higher
pH values. Interestingly, an elevated apparent pKa of the carboxylic group from ∼4.8 to physiologically
relevant values in the small intestine, between 6 and 7, was observed
for long-chain unsaturated fatty acids such as oleic acid in these
self-assembled systems.10 Yet, no systematic
study of the influence of in situ pH increase at values typically
occurring within the digestive tract has been performed during lipolysis
of emulsions containing triglycerides. Hence, in this study, we combine
the lipolysis with a pH ramp from ∼6.5 to 7.5 during the digestion
of mayonnaise. This simulates the increase in pH of the food bolus
as it passes through the small intestine and is also the pH range
where lipase has its maximum activity.26 To our knowledge, this is the first report on real-time monitoring
of nanostructures that are generated during the digestion of mayonnaise,
using synchrotron small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) under selected
pH conditions of the small intestine.

Understanding the dynamic
colloidal transformations during digestion
of complex food systems and the involved alterations in the nanostructural
features can provide important information on the role of these nanostructures
in the delivery of bioactive food components. The nanostructural features
of these systems were further reported to affect the progress of the
lipolysis, indicating the potential to use these nanostructures to
steer the lipid digestion process.27 Hence,
a detailed understanding of the nanostructure formation in food products
such as mayonnaise can open new opportunities for the design of functional
foods with a potential of avoiding or even curing food-related health
issues such as obesity and vitamin malabsorption and further minimizing
the risk of coronary heart disease and cancer.28−30

Results and Discussion
The in situ SAXS data for the digestion of mayonnaise combined
with gradual pH increase from pH 6.5 to 7.4 are presented in Figure 1. Before the addition
of pancreatin extract, the SAXS pattern shows an oil-in-water emulsion
with the low-q upturn in the I(q) from the scattering of the large emulsion particles and
protein aggregates in mayonnaise. The broad correlation peak with
a maximum around q ≈ 2.8 nm–1 in this curve may result from the local structural organization
of the triglycerides.31,32

Figure 1 (a) In situ SAXS profiles acquired during
the lipolysis of mayonnaise
combined with increasing pH from 6.5 to 7.4 over 80 min. The black
SAXS profile is given for mayonnaise at pH 6.5 before lipase addition
and titration. Upon addition of lipase, the SAXS profiles were recorded
every 30 s up to 80 min of lipolysis. The insets present an artistic
view of the nanostructural transitions of normal (oil–water)
emulsion via inverse micellar phases, H2 and Pn3̅m to vesicles and sponge phase, in agreement
with the SAXS data. (b) Representative SAXS profiles from (a) with
identifiable Bragg peaks and further calculated theoretical peak positions
indexed with the corresponding Miller indices for the micellar cubic Fd3̅m phase at 10 min; the H2 phase at 20 and 40 min (second coexisting H2 indexed
in red); and the bicontinuous cubic Pn3̅m phase at 65 min possibly coexisting with vesicles and
sponge phase.

After the addition of
pancreatin extract, containing the pancreatic
lipase, significant and fast ordering of the molecules within the
oil droplets in the emulsion occurred. A broad correlation peak at q ≈ 1.2 nm–1, most likely attributed
to newly generated inverse micelles (L2 phase) inside of
the emulsion droplets, was visible within a digestion time, t, of 30 s. After 2 min of digestion, several reflections
characteristic of an intermediate discontinuous cubic Fd3̅m phase were detected, which started to
vanish again after 10 min. At t > 10 min, three
Bragg
peaks characteristic of a newly formed inverse hexagonal (H2) phase started to dominate the SAXS signal. Interestingly, a second
coexisting H2 phase with smaller lattice dimensions appeared
between t ≈ 33 and 53 min. The complex and
the dynamic composition of the mayonnaise oil droplets may cause the
coexistence of two H2 phases with different lattice constants
during digestion. The kinetics of lipid digestion was shown to depend
on the size of the oil droplet and the lengths of the triglyceride
chain among other factors.6,18 This might lead to
droplets with different extent of digestion during the lipolysis process,
affecting the transfer of hydrophobic and amphiphilic molecules among
their internal structural features. The dynamic lipid redistribution
regulating the structural properties of coexisting liquid crystalline
particles of different composition was reported previously.37 From t > 53 min, the larger
H2 phase coexisted with the inverse bicontinuous cubic Pn3̅m structure up to 63 min of digestion
only when the Bragg reflections from the cubic Pn3̅m phase were detectable. The SAXS patterns
at t > 63 min were dominated by diffuse scattering,
indicating the possible generation and coexistence of the cubic phase
with vesicles or a sponge phase. This signal may also result from
a growing number of interlamellar attachments on the outside of cubosomes,
representing a transition state between the liquid crystalline interior
phase and the outside of the vesicular structure, as reported previously.34 At t > 73 min, the Bragg
reflections
characteristic of the cubic Pn3̅m phase were diminished and a broad hump around q ≈ 0.4 nm–1 was detected. This SAXS curve
indicates the coexistence of a sponge phase (L3 phase)
with vesicles.33 Hence, the swelling of
the water channels of the bicontinuous cubic phase by the charged
lipids further reduces the curvature, resulting in the transition
to the sponge phase with significantly larger water pore dimensions,
coexisting with flat lamellar phases in the form of vesicles.33,35,36 This scattering pattern remains
almost without any change, suggesting the end of the digestion process
after t ≈ 73 min. These results show that
the digestion process triggered a transition from a mayonnaise emulsion
droplet to a unique family of micellar and nonlamellar liquid crystalline
dispersions, in line with the expectation considering the critical
packing parameter in such systems.

To further study the effect
of pH on lipolysis, mayonnaise was
also digested at constant pH = 7.0 (Figure 2a). After pancreatin addition at this pH,
the broad correlation peak characteristic of intermediate inverse
micelles started to appear at q ≈ 1.2 nm–1 during the first 10 min (the early stage of digestion).
After t ≈ 10 min of lipolysis, a structural
transition to a neat cubic Fd3̅m phase occurred, and from t > 60 min, a coexistence
region of the discontinuous cubic Fd3̅m and H2 phases was detected with the H2 phase dominating the signal after around 80 min of digestion (Figure 2b). Interestingly,
from 80 min onward, the detected Bragg reflections of the Fd3̅m cubic phase started to grow
again and dominated the signal from 150 min. No significant changes
in the scattering pattern were observed after 150 min, indicating
that the lattice constants of coexisting liquid crystalline phases
were not affected in the last stage of digestion. Interestingly, compared
with the digestion combined with pH increase presented before, the
formation of highly ordered nanostructures and structural transitions
appear much slower. The dynamic transitions from Fd3̅m to H2 and then back to Fd3̅m again may result from the exchange
of materials between emulsion droplets of different colloidal structures
or extent of digestion. Similar transfer phenomena of hydrophobic
or amphiphilic molecules between internal self-assembled lipidic particles
were previously discussed, and a structural transition from the micellar
cubic Fd3̅m phase to emulsified
microemulsions via hexosomes was observed on mixing with normal oil
emulsions within 60 min.37

Figure 2 (a) SAXS profiles for
the digestion of mayonnaise over 170 min
at a constant pH of 7.0. The black SAXS profile is given for mayonnaise
before lipase addition. Upon addition of lipase, the SAXS profiles
were recorded every 30 s up to 170 min of lipolysis. (b) Representative
SAXS profiles from (a) at different time points of digestion. The
figure presents the identifiable Bragg peaks and further calculated
theoretical peak positions indexed with the corresponding Miller indices
for the cubic Fd3̅m between
10 and 165 min in black and the coexisting H2 phase at
115 min in red. (c) Representative SAXS profiles for the digestion
of mayonnaise at constant pH 7.5 over 105 min. The identifiable Bragg
peaks and further calculated theoretical peak positions indexed with
the corresponding Miller indices for the Fd3̅m at 20 min in black, the biphasic H2/ H2 feature between 20 and 105 min in red, and the Pn3̅m at 105 min in black. Further increase
in digestion time did not induce significant changes in the obtained
SAXS pattern, indicating that the biphasic Pn3̅m/H2 feature was stable and not affected with
increasing digestion.

The structural transitions during mayonnaise digestion at
constant
pH = 7.5, presented in Figure 2c, also confirm the transition from normal emulsion to highly
ordered nanostructures. In the first stage of the digestion process,
at t ≈ 3 min, a broad correlation peak indicating
the formation of inverse micelles was detected, followed by the Bragg
reflections characteristic of inverse cubic Fd3̅m and H2 phases after t ≈
7 min of digestion. The biphasic H2/H2 region
was observed from around 15 min followed by H2/Pn3̅m coexistence region at the end
of digestion (after t ≈ 85 min) when no further
changes in scattering could be observed.

The changes in lattice
constant, a, over the time
of mayonnaise lipolysis, calculated from the SAXS patterns under the
different pH conditions, are summarized in Figure 3. Upon increasing pH during lipolysis, the
lattice constant of the Fd3̅m structure increases from ∼16.5 to 17.5 nm between 2 and 10
min of lipolysis. For the following H2 structure between t ≈ 10 and 53 min of digestion, a increased from 6.2 to 7.4 nm (see Figure 3a). Interestingly, a second coexisting H2 phase appeared between 33 and 53 min with around 0.5 nm smaller
lattice dimensions. The lattice dimensions of the cubic Pn3̅m phase, dominating the SAXS pattern between
53 and 73 min, gradually increased from 24.2 to 27.9 nm.

Figure 3 Calculated
lattice constants of the detected nonlamellar liquid
crystalline nanostructures during lipolysis of mayonnaise combined
with increasing pH from 6.5 to 7.4 over 80 min (a) and the experiments
at constant pH 7.0 (b) and 7.5 (c). The lattice constants of these
phases were calculated from the SAXS profiles presented in Figures 1 and 2.

For the digestion at constant
pH 7.0, presented in Figure 3b, the lattice constant of
the Fd3̅m phase decreased
from ∼16.7 to 16.0 nm within the first 40 min of digestion,
followed by a gradual increase to ∼16.5 nm at 100 min, and
remained constant up to 180 min, whereas the lattice constant of the
H2 phase decreased from ∼6.2 to 6.0 nm between 60
and 100 min of digestion and remained relatively constant up to ∼150
min when the H2 reflections diminished again.

The
lattice constant of the Fd3̅m phase between 5 and 10 min of lipolysis at pH 7.5 decreased
from 17.0 to 15.7 nm (see Figure 3c). The lattice constant of the coexisting H2 structure increased from ∼6.2 to 6.7 nm, with a coexisting
bicontinuous cubic Pn3̅m phase
from 65 min until the end of the digestion process at 105 min.

These results show that the colloidal transitions from normal oil
emulsion to highly ordered nanostructures were faster at elevated
pH: The H2 phase occurred already after ∼7 min of
digestion at pH 7.5 compared with 60 min at pH 7.0. It is interesting
that the lattice dimensions of this H2 phase were also
strongly dependent on pH conditions. Whereas the lattice dimensions
increased gradually from ∼6.2 to 7.4 nm during the lipolysis
coupled with pH increase from 6.5 to 7.4, it decreased from ∼6.2
to 6.0 nm at constant pH 7.0 and increased from ∼6.2 to 6.9
nm at constant pH 7.5. The deprotonation of fatty acids at elevated
pH > 6.5, the apparent pKa of long-chain
fatty acids observed in self-assembled structures, could further increase
the surface charge density.10 The resultant
charge repulsion between the negatively charged carboxylic groups
at the oil–water interface could have a significant impact
on the packing geometry and the detected nanostructural features.
Hence, the higher pH value toward the end of the small intestine supports
colloidal transformations from hydrophobic to more hydrophilic structures.
Steric and electrostatic interactions between the digestion products
at the oil–water interface are thought to be responsible for
these structural transitions.

The pH-dependent fatty acid−water
interfacial film of the
emulsion droplets might be responsible for the modified digestion
kinetics observed in this study and therefore could also affect the
detected sequence of phase transitions during the digestion of mayonnaise.
Deprotonated fatty acids at pH 7.0 and 7.5 together with monoglycerides
can cover the oil–water interface, which could also inhibit
the lipase accessibility to their less surface-active triglyceride
substrates. This inhibition of lipolysis has been recently discussed
as a self-regulatory process of digestion with monoglycerides.38−40

The difference in the structural features at the end of the
digestion
experiments has direct implications on the exchange of materials with
the surrounding aqueous phase: The colloidal transformation from emulsion
droplets via nonlamellar structures to vesicles may induce the release
of encapsulated bioactive food components from the internal lipidic
structure to the surface of the vesicle bilayer and the surrounding
continuous aqueous medium. In contrast to the internal oil–water
interface in nonlamellar structures, the vesicle bilayer is in direct
contact with the surrounding medium and allows their interaction with
the enterocytes in the digestive tract. The similarity in bilayer
curvature among the newly formed vesicles at the end of digestion
and the basic mosaic bilayer structure of cell membranes may further
promote their interaction.24 This can then
increase the absorption of the lipolysis products and solubilized
bioactive components into the circulatory system of the body. Compared
with molecular transport, colloids also enhance the number of fatty
acid and monoglyceride molecules available for uptake by the enterocytes.41 Fatty acids and monoglycerides then enter the
enterocytes as monomers.

In general, the sequence of the colloidal
transformations observed
during mayonnaise digestion is in agreement with our previous reports
on triolein emulsions and milk at constant pH 6.5.18,21 In contrast to the digestion of milk, no equidistant characteristic
peaks indicating the formation of multilamellar structures such as
onion-type vesicles or bilayer stacks were observed during mayonnaise
digestion. This is most likely attributed to a difference in the lipid
type and composition in mayonnaise as compared to milk. Milk contains
a significant amount of saturated fatty acids that may be responsible
for the occurrence of coexisting multilamellar vesicular structures.
In addition, these colloidal particulate systems are different in
the concentration and type of their proteins and bioactive components.

Summary
and Conclusions
The interfacial active main products from
lipolysis of mayonnaise,
monoglycerides and free fatty acids, transformed the oil inside of
the mayonnaise emulsion droplets to more hydrophilic, highly organized
self-assembled structures with a substantial internal oil–water
surface area: The oil-in-water emulsion was converted to emulsified
microemulsions, micellar cubic Fd3̅m phase, inverse H2 phase, Pn3̅m-type cubosomes, and finally sponge (L3) phase and vesicles when the pH was increased from 6.5 to
7.4 during the digestion process. These self-assembled nanostructures
agreed well with the anticipated behavior based on the critical packing
parameter for the amphiphilic molecules that are generated during
the mayonnaise digestion process. Time of digestion and pH strongly
influence the nanostructural features and transformations. At constant
pH, the nanostructure formation and structural transitions appeared
slower compared with those at continuous pH increase. Hence, an increase
in pH during lipolysis seems to further promote the transformation
of the hydrophobic oil environment inside of the mayonnaise emulsion
droplet to highly organized hydrophilic interfaces and vesicles as
final structures. The highly ordered nanostructures, found during
the mayonnaise digestion under simulated in vivo conditions, dominate
the phase behavior in this study. Hence, the generation of these nano-self-assemblies
may provide a plausible mechanistic pathway for in vivo lipid digestion
under high triglyceride content or compromised bile salt conditions.
These dynamic structures and their transformations may then maintain
the digestion process and have direct implications on the transport
and delivery of hydrophobic bioactive food components such as carotenoids,
hydrophobic vitamins, or drugs.

Materials and Methods
Materials
Pancreatin from porcine pancreas (8×
USP grade pancreatin activity) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St.
Louis, MO, USA). It is a mixture of digestive enzymes produced by
the exocrine cells of the porcine pancreas and contains enzymes such
as lipase, amylase, trypsin, ribonuclease, and protease. NaOH (0.2
M) and HCl (0.2 M) (p.a. grade, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA)
were used for pH adjustment. Mayonnaise was store-bought, having 71.5%
fat content with 8.0% saturated fatty acids, 1.6% carbohydrates, 1.3%
proteins, and 1% salt. Mayonnaise (1 mL) was dissolved in 9 mL of
40 mM phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) buffer at the relevant pH for
the digestion experiment (6.5, 7.0, and 7.5). Ultrapure water (R > 18 MΩ) was used for the preparation of all
samples.

Methods
Flow through Lipolysis Model
In
vitro digestion was
conducted in a thermostated glass vessel at 37 °C under constant
magnetic stirring. For pH control and adjustment, a pH electrode (Microelectrode,
Metrohm AG, Switzerland) was interlocked via a computer with a pump
(model 540060, TSE Systems GmbH., Germany) loaded with a 5 mL syringe
containing 0.2 M NaOH. A custom-build computer program triggered the
pH-controlled release of the NaOH from the syringe pump into the reaction
vessel to maintain or increase the pH of the simulated digestive juice
during the digestion in the reaction vessel.

Mayonnaise (1 mL)
was added to 40 mM PBS buffer (9 mL) in the reaction vessel, before
the addition of pancreatin extract. The digestion medium was continuously
drawn from the reaction vessel through a 1.5 mm diameter quartz capillary
mounted in the X-ray beam and back into the vessel at a flow rate
of approximately 10 mL/min to avoid beam damage, through silicone
tubing (total volume ∼1.5 mL) via a peristaltic pump. SAXS
patterns were recorded for 27 s with a 3 s delay between frames. The
digestion reaction was then initiated by the addition of 1 mL of pancreatin
from porcine pancreas solution (0.1 g in 1 mL of 40 mM PBS buffer)
within ∼1 s using a second remotely operated syringe pump (model
PHD 4400, Harvard Apparatus, MA, US) installed at the beamline.

Small-Angle X-ray Scattering
In vitro digestion SAXS
measurements were recorded at the Austrian SAXS beamline at Elettra
(Trieste, Italy).43 An X-ray beam having
a wavelength of 1.54 Å was used, with a sample to detector distance
of 1314 mm providing a q-range of 0.07 < q < 4.5 nm–1 where q is the length of the scattering vector, defined by q = 4π/λ sin(θ/2), λ is the wavelength, and
θ is the scattering angle. The 2D SAXS patterns were acquired
for 27 s with 3 s delay between frames, using a PILATUS3 1M detector
(Dectris Ltd., Baden, Switzerland; active area of 169 × 179 mm2 with a pixel size of 172 μm). The 2D SAXS patterns
were integrated into one-dimensional scattering function I(q) using FIT2D42 and
then analyzed using IGOR pro (WaveMetrics, Inc., Lake Oswego, OR).
Hexagonal, cubic, and lamellar liquid crystalline space groups were
determined, indexing the relative positions of the Bragg peaks in
the scattering profiles.7 Microemulsions
and unilamellar vesicles were characterized using their unique scattering
signatures (e.g., the broad correlation peak reflecting the mean particle-to-particle
distance for micelles and the q–2 dependence at low q values for locally flat bilayer
structures). Further information on the SAXS data analysis can be
found elsewhere.18
