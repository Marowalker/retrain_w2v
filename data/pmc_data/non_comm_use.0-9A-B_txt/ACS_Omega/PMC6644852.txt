Cyclohexane can serve
as a good dihydrogen (H2) carrier
and a safer medium to store and transport H2, as it is
liquid under ambient conditions and it has a relatively high hydrogen
density per unit volume (0.056 g(H2)/cm3(Cy)liq.). However, cyclohexane can release H2 only
with efficient cyclohexane dehydrogenation catalysts. Here, we report
the synthesis of three-dimensional micron-sized block carbon–molybdenum
carbide (BCMC) composite materials that can serve as noble-metal-free
catalysts for cyclohexane dehydrogenation. The materials are synthesized
by a facile hydrothermal synthetic route, and their structures and
morphologies are characterized by various analytical techniques. The
results show that the BCMCs, along with specific morphologies, form
when a source of Mo is included in the precursor and that the sizes
of the microparticles in them can be tailored by changing the relative
amount of Mo used for their synthesis. The as-synthesized BCMC materials
exhibit high catalytic activity for cyclohexane dehydrogenation while
remaining stable and maintaining their catalytic activities during
the reaction. The materials’ catalytic activity increases as
the amount of Mo used to make the materials is increased. This is
further found to be because the BCMC materials containing higher amounts
of ammonium molybdate or higher densities of Mo2C provide
substantially lower activation energies for the reaction. These materials
can be expected to find industrial applications for catalytic production
of H2 from hydrocarbons.

1 Introduction
As
the global fossil fuel reserves continue to deplete and the
negative environmental impacts caused by fossil fuels intensify, the
development and use of clean and environment-friendly energy sources
have gained vital importance.1 At present,
much research effort is dedicated to the production of dihydrogen
(H2) for use as energy carrier because it has a high gravimetric
energy density and hydrogen is an abundant element. However, H2 does not exist naturally and its production from any available
source requires various catalytic dehydrogenation processes or catalysts.

Transition-metal carbides, such as molybdenum and tungsten carbides,
have recently attracted great attention not only for fundamental quantum
mechanical studies2 but also for their
potential applications in areas such as catalysis,3 energy storage,4 humidity sensors,5 and power metallurgy.6 More importantly, here, due to their Pt-like properties, metal carbides
have particularly been increasingly pursued for their catalytic applications
in dehydrogenation as well as hydrogenation reactions,7,8 reforming reactions,9 hydrogen evolution
reaction,10 and ammonia synthesis.11 However, the inherently low specific surface
areas of many metal carbides synthesized by various methods7−11 limit their catalytic performances in various reactions, including
dehydrogenation of alkanes to produce H2. One of the most
commonly used approaches to overcome this issue has involved the synthesis
of metal carbides in the form of small particles dispersed onto the
surfaces of high-surface-area materials, such as activated carbon,12 porous silica,13 zeolite,14 and other carbon materials.15 While some of the resulting metal carbide materials, especially
those supported on conductive materials such as carbon, show good
catalytic activities for various electrochemical reactions,16 others show catalytic activity in conventional
thermocatalytic reactions. For example, nanocomposite materials comprising
Mo2C and onion-like carbon were found to effectively catalyze
dehydrogenation reactions17,18 and nanocarbon-supported
molybdenum carbides were successfully shown to catalyze dehydrogenation
of various alkanes.19 Notably also, various
hybrid materials prepared by dispersing or embedding Mo2C on different shaped nanocarbon materials, including nano-octahedron-shaped
carbons,16 carbon nanofibers,20 hollow carbon microspheres,21 pomegranate-shaped carbons,22 and hierarchically ordered microflowers,23 were found to exhibit good electrocatalytic activity toward the
hydrogen evolution reaction. These previous works suggest that hybrid
materials possessing molybdenum carbides supported on other types
of uniquely shaped micro/nanocarbons may have good catalytic properties
for various reactions, especially those involving dehydrogenation
of alkanes to produce H2.

It is widely known that
the storage, safe handling, and transportation
of H2 are challenging due to its high vapor pressure. It
is also known that many liquid organic compounds (LOCs) can serve
as hydrogen carriers and deliver H2 through dehydrogenation
reactions.24 Among many LOCs that can carry
and deliver H2, cyclohexane is a great candidate because
it is liquid under ambient condition and it has a relatively high
hydrogen density per unit volume (0.056 g(H2)/cm3(Cy)liq.). Thus, cyclohexane can potentially be used to
safely store H2 and transport it over a desirable distance.
In addition, cyclohexane entails relatively low cost during H2 storage and transportation. However, like many other LOCs
and hydrogen carriers, cyclohexane requires dehydrogenation catalysts
to release the hydrogen in it in the form of H2. Furthermore,
the catalysts must be efficient to be viable candidates for large-scale
commercial applications, i.e., they should make the dehydrogenation
process occur over the minimal activation energy barrier or at low
energy expense. For dehydrogenation of cyclohexane and other related
compounds, although noble metals such as platinum are efficient catalysts,25 their high cost and scarcity limit their extensive
use.

Herein, we report the synthesis of noble-metal-free composite
materials
composed of three-dimensional (3D) block carbon and molybdenum carbide
(BCMC) particles that show efficient catalytic activity for dehydrogenation
of cyclohexane. The materials are synthesized by hydrothermal carbonization
and characterized using various analytical methods. Their catalytic
properties toward cyclohexane dehydrogenation are evaluated using
a fixed-bed reactor, and the results indicate that BCMCs effectively
catalyze the reaction. Their catalytic activities for the reaction
are improved by tailoring the sizes of the BCMC particles via optimization
of the amount of Mo precursor used for the synthesis of the materials.
Additionally, the reason behind the materials’ high catalytic
activity for cyclohexane dehydrogenation reaction is also studied.
Catalytic reaction data obtained at different reaction temperatures
suggest that the BCMC materials, especially those made using higher
amounts of Mo precursor, render low activation energy (Ea) to the reaction.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Synthesis and Characterization
The
synthesis of BCMC composite materials was achieved via a simple procedure
comprising three steps (see Experimental Section for details). First, three commercially available precursors, namely,
β-cyclodextrin, phthalic acid, and ammonium molybdate (0.38
g), were mixed with deionized water, then the solution was hydrothermally
treated at 140 °C, and finally, the solid product was carbonized
in N2 atmosphere at 850 °C. The types of reagents
as well as the relative amount of ammonium molybdate in the precursors
were varied to investigate their effects on the compositions as well
as the structures of the final materials. Accordingly, three different
materials, namely, BCMC-5 (using 5 wt % Mo), BCMC-15 (using 15 wt
% Mo), and BCMC-25 (using 25 wt % Mo), were synthesized. For comparative
studies, a reference material, activated carbon-supported Mo2C (Mo2C/AC), was also synthesized.

Figure 1 shows the X-ray diffraction
(XRD) patterns of the different carbon–molybdenum carbide composite
materials resulted from the synthesis. The peaks observed at 34.4,
37.9, 39.4, 52.1, 61.5, 69.6, 74.6, and 75.5° were attributed
to the (100), (002), (101), (102), (110), (103), (112), and (201)
planes of hexagonal molybdenum carbide (Mo2C), respectively.
A peak at 26°, which can be assigned to the crystalline phase
of carbon, is observed in the XRD pattern of BCMC-15, which was synthesized
with moderate amount of Mo. This indicates that a moderate amount
of Mo favors the graphitization of some of the carbon formed in the
material during carbonization. On the other hand, a broad peak indicating
the presence of amorphous carbon was observed in the XRD pattern of
BCMC-5, which was synthesized with the smallest amount of Mo. This
must have been due to the fact that the amount of residual carbon
left behind during the carbonization step was high since only a small
amount of carbon went to form molybdenum carbide with the small amount
of Mo used. In the case of the XRD pattern of BCMC-25, which was prepared
with a high amount of Mo, no diffraction peak associated with amorphous
or graphitic carbon was observed; here, the carbon must have almost
exclusively gone to form Mo carbides, leaving behind no residual carbon.

Figure 1 XRD patterns
of different BCMC materials: (a) BCMC-5, (b) BCMC-15,
and (c) BCMC-25.

No peaks other than those
of carbon and Mo2C were observed
in the XRD patterns, suggesting that the materials were carbon–molybdenum
carbide composite materials. Interestingly, even if the amount of
ammonium molybdate used for the synthesis of the materials was increased,
from 5 wt % Mo to 25 wt % Mo, the intensity of the characteristic
peak associated with Mo2C did not increase, implying that
the Mo2C nanoparticles forming in the materials via the
synthesis remained similar in size. The result also suggested that
the Mo2C nanoparticles formed with the carbon materials
were present in a well-dispersed form and they did not tend to grow,
even when the amount of ammonium molybdate included in the precursors
was increased.

The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images
of BCMC-5 and BCMC-15,
displayed in Figure 2, clearly showed block-shaped particles. In the images, especially
those of BCMC-15, some irregularly shaped blocks of carbon particles
were also evident (Figure 2c). Magnified images (Figure 2b,d) showed that some of the BCMC nanoparticles had
irregular shapes but clear edges. In the case of BCMC-5, the thicknesses
of the larger blocks were slightly greater than 200 nm, whereas in
the case of BCMC-15, the thicknesses of the particles were all ca.
200 nm (marked in the inset) and those of the smaller ones were ca.
400 nm. Additionally, well-defined particles, mostly pentagon- and
hexagon-shaped ones, were prevalent in the latter, suggesting that
the amount of ammonium molybdate precursor dictated the nature of
growth of the 3D block carbon particles, besides their sizes.

BCMC-15.

Figure 3 shows the
SEM and elemental distribution images of a sample of BCMC-25. BCMC-25
could be seen to have small particles, most of which have similar
sizes (Figure 3a).
The magnified SEM image (Figure 3b) showed that the sizes of most of the polyhedron-shaped
particles were smaller than 400 nm and the thicknesses of the major
particles were slightly greater than 200 nm. The energy-dispersive
X-ray spectrum of BCMC-25 (Figure 3c) indicated that the particles contained only carbon
and molybdenum. Furthermore, elemental mapping showed that carbon
and molybdenum elements were well dispersed in the nanocomposite materials
(Figure 3d,e).

images, (c) energy-dispersive X-ray spectrum, and (d,
e) elemental mapping images of BCMC-25.

The block-shaped carbon and dispersed Mo2C particles
were also seen in the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images
(Figure 4a,b). The
image of a single carbon particle showed block morphology, with Mo2C nanoparticles (the sizes of which are ca. 10 nm) anchoring
on its surfaces (Figure 4b). The high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM)
images exhibited a clear crystal fringe and lattice distances of ca.
0.227 and 0.250 nm, corresponding to the crystal planes of (101) and
(100) (Figure 4c,d).
The X-ray photoelectron spectrum of Mo 3d and the sum of the peak-fitted
curves (Figure 4e)
revealed peaks corresponding to Mo0, Mo3+, Mo4+, and Mo6+ species.26 The N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms of the different
BCMC materials showed a type IV-type isotherm with H3 hysteresis loop
in the relative pressure (P/P0) range of 0.6–1.0 (Figures 4f and S1a), suggesting
the presence of a mesoporous structure in all of the materials. The
pore sizes were distributed over wide ranges (inset in Figures 4f and S1b), with average pore diameters of ca. 24, 16, and 14 nm
for BCMC-5, BCMC-15, and BCMC-25, respectively. The presence of significant
structural defects in the materials was confirmed by Raman spectroscopy
(Figure S2).

spectrum and deconvoluted peaks, and (f) N2 adsorption/desorption
isotherm (inset, pore-size distribution) of BCMC-25.

To indirectly assess the nature of growth and the
role of Mo in
the growth process of the polyhedron-shaped 3D block carbon coupled
with Mo2C, several other control materials were synthesized
without including β-cyclodextrin, phthalic acid, or ammonium
molybdate in the precursor. In the case of the precursor containing
only ammonium molybdate and β-cyclodextrin (i.e., no phthalic
acid), instead of molybdenum carbide, MoO2 was formed after
the carbonization step (Figure S3). This
may have been due to the fact that not enough carbon was provided
by the precursor during the carbonization step due to the absence
of phthalic acid in it. Meanwhile, when ammonium molybdate and phthalic
acid were used in the precursor, no solid product was obtained. However,
when β-cyclodextrin and phthalic acid were used in the precursor
without ammonium molybdate, the resulting material contained only
spherical carbon nanoparticles (Figure S4). These results indicate that molybdate ions play a key role in
the growth of 3D block carbon–molybdenum carbide composite
materials, besides slowly turning into molybdenum carbide particles
during carbonization. Furthermore, as the molybdenum carbide grows,
it starts to restrain the growth of spherical carbon particles, favoring
instead the formation of the block-shaped BCMC particles. In other
words, during the carbonization step, ammonium molybdate indirectly
promotes the anisotropic growth of the 3D Mo-polymer precursor that
finally turns into 3D block carbon decorated with Mo2C
nanoparticles (Scheme 1). When a higher amount of ammonium molybdate is used in the precursor,
it creates a barrier between Mo-polymeric structures, restraining
their further growth (Figure S5). Hence,
an increase in the amount of ammonium molybdate (from 5 to 25 wt %
Mo) leads to smaller BCMC particles. However, when the amount of Mo
was increased further to 35 wt % and more, instead of Mo carbides,
MoO2 was largely formed in the products (see Figure S6).

2.2 Catalytic
Properties
The dehydrogenation
of cyclohexane over the various BCMC composite materials and the control
material (Mo2C/AC) was measured for 210 min at 315 °C
(Figure 5a) as well
as at other temperatures (Figures S7a–S9a). The catalytic activity of BCMC materials to dehydrogenate cyclohexane
increased in the order of BCMC-5 < BCMC-15 < BCMC-25, with a
selectivity of ca. 100% toward dehydrogenation (or H2 production)
in all cases, regardless of the reaction temperature at which the
catalytic tests were performed. This result implies that decreasing
the size of 3D block carbon leads to high conversion in cyclohexane
dehydrogenation. Notably also, BCMC-15 (which has a Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) surface area of 19 m2/g) and BCMC-25 (which has a
BET surface area of 28 m2/g) showed better catalytic activities
than Mo2C/AC (whose BET surface area is 440 m2/g) at all of the temperatures. Furthermore, all of the BCMC materials
(i.e., BCMC-5, BCMC-15, and BCMC-25) showed better catalytic activities
than activated carbon-supported Mo2C (Mo2C/AC)
above 310 °C, although Mo2C nanoparticles were well
dispersed on AC surfaces (Figure S10).
This means, compared to their activated carbon-supported Mo2C counterpart, 3D block carbon-coupled Mo2C particles
are more efficient catalysts for cyclohexane dehydrogenation reaction,
even despite that they have relatively lower surface area. The catalytic
performance of BCMC for cyclohexane dehydrogenation (conversion %
and selectivity) also fares well with some of the best non-noble metal
catalysts and even noble-metal catalysts reported in the literature
(Table S1).

Besides, all of the BCMC materials showed no obvious decrease
in
their catalytic activity toward cyclohexane dehydrogenation for at
least 210 min (Figures 5a and S7a–S9a), indicating their
stability during the reaction. The initial and final rates of conversions
of reactants over the materials, shown in Figure 5b, further corroborated that BCMC materials
reasonably maintained their catalytic activities, although BCMC-25
deactivated at a relatively higher rate than the other catalysts due
to its smaller Mo carbide particles, and thus their higher rates of
sintering at high reaction temperature (Figure S10). Among all of the BCMC materials, BCMC-25 (i.e., the 3D
block carbon–Mo2C materials made from 25 wt % Mo)
exhibited the highest catalytic activity toward cyclohexane dehydrogenation
(Figures 5c and S7b–S9b). After reaction, all of the catalysts
maintained their structures and morphology (Figures S11 and S12) and the Mo in them remained in the same oxidation
state as that in the original catalysts (Figure S13).

The possible reasons for the high catalytic activity
of BCMC materials
toward dehydrogenation may be related to their morphology and the
degree of defects in them. Three-dimensional block carbon has rough
surfaces. Moreover, increasing the amount of Mo makes the size of
3D block carbon decrease, and correspondingly the surface area of
the carbon block increases. These can all lead to increased dispersion
of Mo2C particles and a high density of catalytically active
sites for cyclohexane dehydrogenation. Thus, the self-regulating effect
of higher amount of Mo in decreasing the size of carbon support and
increasing the dispersion of Mo2C indirectly plays a key
role in the materials’ ability to catalyze the dehydrogenation
reaction. However, further increase in the amount of Mo did not continue
to result in the same effect because when the amount was increased
(to form, e.g., BCMC-35 and BCMC-45), MoO2, which exhibits
no activity in dehydrogenation, was formed (Figure S6) rather than molybdenum carbides.

To further explore
the reasons behind BCMC materials’ high
catalytic activity toward dehydrogenation, the activation energy (Ea) of the reaction over the materials was calculated
by obtaining kinetics data at different reaction temperatures and
then fitting the curves over the data. The results are displayed in Figure 5d. The slopes of
the lines decreased as the amount of Mo used to make the BCMC materials
was increased. The calculated Ea values
were 225, 175, and 155 kJ/mol for BCMC-5, BCMC-15, and BCMC-25, respectively.
Interestingly, the value of Ea for BCMC-25
(155 kJ/mol) was less than that of Mo2C/AC (171 kJ/mol,
whose fitting line is not shown), even though they both contained
the same amount of Mo. Thus, the low activation energy is most likely
another reason behind BCMC’s high catalytic activity toward
cyclohexane dehydrogenation reaction.

3 Conclusions
Composite materials composed of 3D block carbon and molybdenum
carbide (denoted BCMC) and containing different amounts of Mo (or
Mo2C) have been successfully synthesized by the hydrothermal
synthetic method. During the synthesis, the amount of Mo precursor
has been found to play an important role in dictating the size and
uniformity of BCMC. So, by controlling the relative amount of Mo in
the precursor, the structures and morphologies as well as the catalytic
properties of the materials toward cyclohexane dehydrogenation could
be tailored. The catalytic test results indicated that the BCMC materials
were suitable for dehydrogenation of cyclohexane with those containing
more well-dispersed Mo2C particles, in particular, exhibiting
the highest catalytic activities. Besides their structures, the reason
that BCMC materials effectively catalyzed the dehydrogenation reaction
was because they could render low activation energy for the reaction.
During the reactions at various temperatures, the materials have also
remained stable and maintained their catalytic activities.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Synthesis of BCMC
In a typical synthesis
of BCMC materials, in a round-bottom flask, β-cyclodextrin (1.84
g) was dissolved in deionized water (30 mL) and in a second flask
phthalic acid (5.65 g) was dissolved in deionized water (15 mL). The
two solutions were then mixed together by a magnetic stirrer. The
resulting solution was added into another solution prepared in a flask
by dissolving ammonium molybdate (0.38 g) and deionized water (15
mL). Subsequently, the solution was transferred into a stainless steel
autoclave and treated at 140 °C for 12 h. The mixture was then
centrifuged, and the solid product was washed and dried in an oven
at 70 °C and finally carbonized in N2 atmosphere at
850 °C for 2 h. This gave block the carbon–molybdenum
carbide (BCMC) composite material, which was denoted as BCMC-5 (in
which “5” indicates the 5 wt % Mo used to make the material).

By following a similar procedure but using 15, 25, 35, and 45 wt
% Mo, BCMC-15, BCMC-25, BCMC-35, and BCMC-45 materials, respectively,
were synthesized. To determine the effect of the type of precursor
on the morphology of the products, control materials involving only
two of the three precursors, i.e., ammonium molybdate and β-cyclodextrin,
or ammonium molybdate and phthalic acid, through an otherwise similar
synthetic procedure, were synthesized. Moreover, a reference material,
activated carbon-supported Mo2C, was synthesized by the
incipient impregnation method. In this case, 0.46 g of ammonium molybdate
was dissolved in 10 mL of deionized water and the solution was added
dropwise onto 1 g of pretreated activated carbon to impregnate molybdate
ions into the pores of the carbon material. The material was dried
under ambient condition at room temperature and then in an oven at
70 °C. The product was subjected to carbonization at 850 °C
for 2 h in N2 atmosphere. This finally gave activated carbon-supported
Mo2C, which was denoted as Mo2C/AC.

4.2 Characterization
The crystallinity
of the materials (catalysts) synthesized above was characterized by
X-ray diffraction (XRD, Rigaku MiniFlex) operating with Cu Kα
radiation (λ = 0.1542 nm). The diffraction patterns were collected
in the 2θ range of 10–80°. The morphologies and
structures of the materials were characterized by a scanning electron
microscope (SEM, SU8010) operating at 200 kV and a scanning transmission
electron microscope (S/TEM, FEI Tecnai G2 F20) operating also at 200
kV. In addition, using the SEM instrument, energy-dispersive X-ray
spectroscopy (EDS) was performed to map the elemental distribution
in the materials. The materials were analyzed by X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS) using ESCALAB 250 instrument equipped with a monochromatic
X-ray source (Al Kα hν = 1486.6 eV).
The surface area (BET) and pore-size distribution of the materials
were determined by N2 adsorption/desorption analysis, which
was performed using a Micromeritics Tristar II 3020 instrument. To
assess the relative defects in the materials, Raman scattering spectroscopy
was performed with a Kratos, XSM 800 instrument. The excitation wavelength
of the spectrometer was 633 nm (1.96 eV).

4.3 Catalysis
The catalytic properties
of the materials were tested using a fixed-bed reactor under constant
pressure. In each catalytic run, 150 mg of sample was placed at the
center of a quartz tube (with internal diameter, ID = 5 mm), which
was then tightly sealed. The temperature around the reactor was programmed
to: (1) increase from room temperature to 473 K over a period of 30
min under N2 atmosphere, (2) then increase from 473 to
623 K at a rate of 5 °C/min and remain at 623 K for 2 h under
H2 atmosphere, and (3) finally decrease at a rate of 5
°C/min from 623 K to one of the following reaction temperatures:
578, 583, 588, or 593 K. Once the temperature reached one of these
reaction temperatures, cyclohexane was pumped into the reactor at
a flow rate of 0.01 mL/min. The reaction products were analyzed on-line
by a gas chromatography instrument equipped with a thermal conductivity
detector and a dioctyl sebacate column, and the conversion % of cyclohexane
was then calculated. To compare the catalytic activity of the materials
to those of other conventional carbon-supported molybdenum carbide
materials, the catalytic performance of activated carbon-supported
Mo2C (Mo2C/AC) was also evaluated under a similar
reaction condition. The turnover frequency of BCMC catalysts during
the reaction was calculated based on the mole of cyclohexane converted
to benzene per mole of Mo per second.
