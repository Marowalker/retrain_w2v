In this study, we demonstrate the
theranostic capability of actively
targeted, site-specific multibranched gold nanoantennas (MGNs) in
triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells in vitro. By utilizing
multiplexed surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) imaging, enabled
by the narrow peak widths of Raman signatures, we simultaneously targeted
immune checkpoint receptor programmed death ligand 1 (PDL1) and the
epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) overexpressed in TNBC
cells. A 1:1 mixture of MGNs functionalized with anti-PDL1 antibodies
and Raman tag 5,5-dithio-bis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB) and MGNs
functionalized with anti-EGFR antibodies and Raman tag para-mercaptobenzoic acid (pMBA) were incubated with
the cells. SERS imaging revealed a cellular traffic map of MGN localization
by surface binding and receptor-mediated endocytosis, enabling targeted
diagnosis of both biomarkers. Furthermore, cells incubated with anti-EGFR–pMBA–MGNs and illuminated with an 808 nm laser for
15 min at 4.7 W/cm2 exhibited photothermal cell death only
within the laser spot (indicated by live/dead cell fluorescence assay).
Therefore, this study not only provides an optical imaging platform
that can track immunomarkers with spatiotemporal control but also
demonstrates an externally controlled light-triggered therapeutic
approach enabling receptor-specific treatment with biocompatible theranostic
nanoprobes.

Introduction
Theranostic nanostructures
that combine both diagnostic and therapeutic
components within a single nanoscale platform have attracted significant
interest in the past decade,1−4 as they enable both highly specific detection of
disease markers and subsequent targeted, image-guided treatment all
within a single clinical procedure. Gold nanostructures are particularly
well-suited for multifunctional theranostics due to their high biocompatibility
and straightforward surface chemistry, enabling functionalization
of multiple molecules including targeting moieties, contrast agents,
and charge-neutralizing polymers. The theranostic capabilities of
several shape- and size-controlled gold nanostructures have been studied
in the past decade,5−12 and some are already in clinical trials.13 However, the combination of multiplexed imaging enabling targeted
detection of multiple receptors with a therapeutic modality has not
been demonstrated successfully. In this work, we show the theranostic
functionality of near-infrared (NIR) resonant multibranched gold nanoantennas
(MGNs) in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells in vitro by combining
surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) imaging with photothermal
therapy (PTT). TNBC is highly aggressive and one of the most lethal
types of breast cancer due to the lack of response to endocrine treatment
and other targeted therapies.14,15 We particularly show
the multiplexed detection of immunomarker programmed death ligand
1 (PDL1) and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in TNBC cells.
The upregulation of immune checkpoint receptor programmed death protein
1, PD-1, expressed on activated CD8+ T-cells, impedes effector
T-cell function by binding to its ligand, PDL1.16−18 Upon binding,
interferons (IFN-γ) produced by activated T-cells upregulate
PDL1 expression, which contributes to immunosuppression in the tumor
microenvironment. Cancer immunotherapy, particularly the blockade
of inhibitory pathways such as PDL1, has recently driven a paradigm
shift in the treatment of multiple cancers and shown significant advantages
over chemotherapy and radiation.18 However,
the patient response rate of PDL1 therapies remains low (<30%)
in part due to both heterogeneous PDL1 expression among patients and
within the same patients’ primary and metastatic disease sites.
Although the histopathology of invasive biopsies remains the gold
standard, they are grossly misinterpreted, necessitating a reliable,
noninvasive immunoimaging platform that can accurately detect PDL1
and simultaneously identify other relevant biomarkers to enable combination
therapies. PDL1 has also been shown to be overexpressed in breast
cancer cells, which underscores the significance of PDL1 as a target
receptor for immunoimaging.19−21 In addition to PDL1, EGFRs have
been implicated in the pathogenesis and progression of up to 80% of
TNBCs.22,23 EGFR is a transmembrane glycoprotein that
is a member of the erbB family of tyrosine kinases. EGFR gene amplification
and gene mutation both contribute to the overexpression of this receptor,
and recently monoclonal antibodies and small-molecule inhibitors targeting
EGFR have shown improved outcomes in TNBC.14 Therefore, the strengths of this work are the simultaneous detection
of PDL1 and EGFR with high-resolution multiplexed SERS mapping achieved
with MGNs, providing a qualitative distribution of both markers in
vitro accompanied with light-controlled induction of cell death.

SERS imaging has rapidly progressed from a bench-scale spectroscopic
tool to a preclinical diagnosis technique.24−27 Relative to other clinical imaging
techniques, SERS offers high spatial resolution (cellular-level) and
the capability to perform multiplexing, facilitated by the narrow
spectral characteristics of the vibrational footprint of Raman molecules.28−30 This enables the detection of multiple receptors with high
specificity, but unlike fluorescence imaging, SERS imaging is not
limited by tissue autofluorescence and photobleaching.31 The combination of this preclinical imaging
technique with therapeutic MGNs is highly promising, as it enables
the detection of multiple biomarkers of cancer and, simultaneously,
externally controlled light-mediated therapy.

MGNs consist of
an “antenna-like” spherical core
that absorbs incident light, and the light is then routed through
the protrusions and concentrated at the tips.32 This unique geometry of MGNs gives rise to the “nanoantenna
effect,” generating intense electromagnetic near fields in
their vicinity, which is useful for efficiently converting resonant
light to heat for PTT.32−34 Furthermore, the one-step synthesis of MGNs in the
presence of a biological buffer, 2-[4-(2-hydroxyethyl)piperazin-1-yl]ethanesulfonic
acid (HEPES, pH 7.4), promotes their biocompatibility. HEPES binds
weakly to gold surfaces,
which facilitates straightforward surface modification with Raman-active
molecules and antibodies for targeted detection. In addition, their
sub-100 nm size is ideal for cellular uptake, enabling rapid surface
binding and endocytosis in cells. Here, by employing a mixture of
MGNs functionalized with Raman tag para-mercaptobenzoic
acid (pMBA) and anti-EGFR antibodies and Raman tag
5,5-dithio-bis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB) and anti-PDL1 antibodies,
we successfully demonstrated multiplexed SERS mapping as well as highly
localized cell death via PTT. We anticipate the findings of this work
will ultimately be translated to theranostics in vivo, contributing
insights into the emerging field of immunoimaging and immunotherapy.

Results
and Discussion
MGNs were synthesized via a one-step HEPES-mediated
synthesis as
described in our previously reported work.32 The average size of the MGNs, including the core and protrusions,
was ∼65 ± 7 nm (branch-to-branch length) as visualized
under transmission electron microscopy (TEM, Figure 1a). The heterogeneity in dimension is correlated
to the variable protrusion length and protrusion density occurring
during the synthesis process.32 The plasmon
resonance of MGNs was tuned to ∼800 nm prior to functionalization
(Figure 1b) to enable
absorption of tissue-penetrating NIR light (690–900 nm). The
NIR light absorption is advantageous for PTT, as an ∼800 nm
laser can be utilized to activate the photothermal process. MGNs were
further functionalized with antibodies to enable site-specific, targeted
delivery of both diagnostic and therapeutic functions in a model TNBC
cell line, MDA-MB-231. MGNs were therefore functionalized with anti-EGFR
antibodies via a heterobifunctional poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) linker,
orthopyridyl disulfide (OPSS)–PEG–N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) ester. In this bioconjugation chemistry,
the thiols on the OPSS group form a covalent link with the gold surface,
whereas the NHS ester reacts with the amines of the antibodies to
form an amide bond. Furthermore, the MGNs were tagged with a Raman
molecule, pMBA, to enable SERS imaging and coated
with an additional layer of PEG to neutralize any surface charge and
minimize off-target interactions. The zeta potential of MGNs was −4.3
± 1 mV after PEG coating, indicating their desirable near-neutral
surface. The successful functionalization of antibodies, pMBA, and PEG was monitored with a spectrophotometer, and a ∼32
nm redshift in the plasmon resonance was observed due to an increase
in the local refractive index of the MGNs (Figure 1b). The Raman footprint of the final functionalized
MGNs, anti-EGFR–pMBA–MGNs, was confirmed
by examining the SERs spectra (Figure 1c-i), which showed dominant peaks at 1074 and 1580
cm–1 corresponding to C–C stretching modes
and ring stretching modes of pMBA.35 The weaker peaks between 1000 and 1200 cm–1 correspond to the antibody and PEG branching, as determined through
control experiments.

(ii) that was utilized for multiplexed Raman imaging, showing distinguishable
peaks at 1074 and 1580 cm–1 corresponding to pMBA and at 1325 and 1551 cm–1 corresponding
to DTNB.

To further investigate the ability
of MGNs for multiplexed SERS
imaging, the PDL1 biomarker was targeted, as it has been found in
numerous tumor types including breast cancer and is overexpressed
in MDA-MB-231 cells.26,27 MGNs were functionalized with
anti-PDL1 antibodies via the same heterobifunctional linker and Raman
molecule DTNB via a gold–thiol bond. The MGNs were further
coated with an additional layer of PEG for in vitro stability. The
Raman footprint of the functionalized MGNs, anti-PDL1–DTNB–MGNs,
was assessed with SERS (Figure 1c-ii), and dominant peaks at 1325 and 1551 cm–1, corresponding to the symmetric stretching mode of the nitro group
of DTNB and the ring stretching mode, respectively, were observable.36 The SERS spectra of the mixture of MGNs utilized
for multiplexing (anti-EGFR–pMBA–MGNs
+ anti-PDL1–DTNB–MGNs) at a 1:1 ratio demonstrated distinguishable
peaks from both pMBA and DTNB with minimal overlap
(Figure 1c-iii), which
enabled us to successfully detect both EGFR and PDL1 receptors in
vitro with high sensitivity and specificity. Prior to in vitro studies,
we wanted to validate the utility of EGFR as a viable target and qualitatively
demonstrate overexpression of EGFR in the MDA-MB-231 cells with a
fluorescent secondary antibody assay. MDA-MB-231 cells were incubated
with the anti-EGFR primary antibody followed by washing, incubation
with blocking solution to minimize nonspecific binding, and addition
of a secondary antibody complexed with phycoerythrin (PE). PE is a
fluorescent protein with excitation at 488 nm and emission at 565–605
nm. Confocal fluorescence images (Figure S1) clearly indicate the high overexpression of EGFR in TNBC cells
with fluorescent signal localized on the cellular edges, indicating
EGFR expression on the cell surface. Following this assay, we performed
SERS imaging targeting the EGFR biomarker on MDA-MB-231 cells. Cells
were cultured on six-well plate dishes to ∼90% confluency,
followed by incubation with anti-EGFR–pMBA–MGNs
(170 μg/mL) for 16 h at 37 °C and repeated washing. After
fixation, the cells were visualized under TEM to confirm surface binding
and internalization of MGNs. The functionalized MGNs were both localized
on the surface (Figure 2a) and internalized within (Figure 2b) the cells. MGNs were also found in cytoplasmic vesicles,
demonstrating endocytosis (Figure 2c–e). We also note that MGNs maintained their
structural integrity in cells and that they were not found within
the nucleus or mitochondria, which is in agreement with previous literature.37,38

cells. (a) Transmission electron micrographs of cells incubated with
anti-EGFR–pMBA–MGNs for 16 h show both
(a) surface binding and (b) internalization by cells. The arrows denote
organelles (blue, nucleus; white, mitochondria) with MGNs present
in the cytoplasm (red). (c–e) High-magnification images show
that internalization occurs via intracellular vesicles ranging ∼400–500
nm in size. Both on the surface and within these vesicles, the MGNs
maintain their morphology.

The targeted SERS mapping of MDA-MB-231 cells was performed
by
growing the cells on calcium fluoride (CaF2) disks to minimize
autofluorescence, thus enabling higher-resolution SERS mapping. Cells
were incubated with anti-EGFR–pMBA–MGNs
(170 μg/mL) for 16 h at 37 °C followed by repeated washing,
fixation, and imaging with a Raman microscope. The bright spots in
the brightfield confocal image (Figure 3a) show scattering from MGN localization on the cell
surface. The rectangular area of the brightfield image provides the x and y coordinates for SERS mapping. The
Raman spectra of the cells were collected at 0.75 μm steps,
providing a biochemical “traffic map” of the cells in
the area. Static spectra were recorded with a 1200 cm–1 center with 10 s acquisition times at 2 mW power. The Raman intensity
of the 1580 cm–1 peak, which corresponds to the
C–C stretching modes and ring stretching modes of pMBA, was plotted as a function of position after analysis and background
subtraction, creating a ∼100 μm × 100 μm SERS
map (Figure 3b). The
1580 cm–1 peak of pMBA does not
overlap with the Raman peaks of the intracellular lipid and provides
an accurate means to demonstrate localization of anti-EGFR–pMBA–MGNs by examining the intensity. SERS point
spectra are provided from the SERS map at selected locations, indicating
high (Figure 3c-i),
low (Figure 3c-ii),
and no pMBA signals (Figure 3c-iii), which directly correspond to the
amount of anti-EGFR–pMBA–MGNs localized
in and on the surface of the cells. The intense SERS signal in areas
with a high concentration of MGNs arises from the formation of SERS
hot spots where strong electromagnetic and chemical enhancements occur.39−41 Furthermore, the brightfield image overlapped with the SERS map
(Figure 3d) shows excellent
correlation with the MGN distribution, demonstrating the efficacy
of SERS in targeted imaging of the EGFR biomarker in TNBC cells. We
also performed control studies where MGNs conjugated to pMBA without antibodies (pMBA–MGNs) under
the same conditions and at the same concentrations were incubated
in MDA-MB-231 cells on CaF2 disks, and SERS maps were obtained
(Figure S2). The relatively weak Raman
signal observable in these control experiments suggests that highly
specific detection of EGFR is achieved only by MGNs labeled with the
targeting antibodies. To further demonstrate the efficacy of MGNs
in specifically targeting EGFR-overexpressing breast cancer cells,
MCF7 was chosen as a control cell line, due to its low EGFR expression.42,43 MCF7 cells were seeded on CaF2 disks, anti-EGFR–pMBA–MGNs were incubated with cells, and SERS mapping
was performed (Figure S3b). We observed
minimal 1580 cm–1 intensity throughout the disk,
indicating minimal MGNs bound to the MCF7 surface (Figure S3c).

or (ii) low pMBA signal as well as (iii) no signal

The immune checkpoint
receptor PD-1 and its ligand PDL1 have been
shown to be overexpressed in many subtypes of breast cancer, including
in MDA-MB-231 TNBC cells.19−21 Immunotherapies with checkpoint
blockade have already demonstrated tremendous success in multiple
cancers and are now in clinical trials.44−46 Therefore, multiplexed
targeted detection of PDL1 combined with EGFR offers a transformational
approach to ultimately impact personalized immunotherapies. We performed
multiplexed SERS imaging by simultaneously incubating cells with a
mixture of anti-PDL1–DTNB–MGNs and anti-EGFR–pMBA–MGNs in a 1:1 ratio (see Materials
and Methods Section for details). Because
the vibrational signatures of DTNB and pMBA do not
overlap, this approach allows us to detect both PDL1 and EGFR by mapping
the signals of DTNB (1325 cm–1) and pMBA (1580 cm–1), respectively. Brightfield imaging
(Figure 4a) shows an
image of cells with light scattering from MGNS localized on the cell
surface. A Raman spectral map of ∼100 μm × 100 μm
was measured with 0.75 μm steps, and the intensities of the
1325–1 peak (ISERS1325) and 1580 cm–1 peak (ISERS1580) were plotted together as a function of position (Figure 4b). A strong signal is observable
from both DTNB and pMBA, and the high spatiotemporal
resolution of Raman allows us to qualitatively evaluate the localization
of individual receptor bound MGNs. The intensities of the 1325 cm–1 peak and of the 1580 cm–1 peak
are plotted individually (Figure S4a,c)
and overlapped (Figure S4b) as a function
of position in the SI. A magnified view
of the local traffic map of the multiplexed SERS footprint is shown
in Figure 4c, correlating
the distributions of PDL1 and EGFR in the cells. Note that a strong
signal is observed where multiple MGNs cluster, giving rise to SERS
enhancements via hot spots. Specific locations on the magnified SERS
map (Figure 4c) and
corresponding SERS spectra (Figure 4d) indicate spatial localization from both probes (Figure 4d-i), DTNB alone
(Figure 4d-ii), pMBA alone (Figure 4d-iii), or signal only from cellular lipids at 1440 cm–1 (Figure 4d-iv).47 We note that the intrinsic
Raman peaks of biological lipids are typically very weak, necessitating
the use of labeled MGNs for characterizing receptor expression.

(dashed box). The arrows denote peaks of interest, 1325 cm–1 peak for DTNB and 1580 cm–1 peak for pMBA.

Furthermore, to demonstrate that
the observed Raman signal results
from specific binding of antibody-conjugated MGNs rather than due
to clustering via nonspecific binding, we performed a control study
where 4 μg/mL monoclonal anti-PDL1 (1 h, 37 °C) was introduced
in cells to block the PDL1 receptors prior to incubating with a 1:1
mixture of anti-PDL1–DTNB–MGNs and anti-EGFR–pMBA–MGNs (170 μg/mL). The brightfield image
of the cells (Figure S5a) as well as SERS
mapping (Figure S5b) at 0.75 μm steps
indicated that the blocking of receptors results in significantly
fewer MGNs binding to cells (Figure S5c). The multiplexed SERS traffic map presented for the experimental
group (Figure 4b) and
control group (Figure S5b) demonstrate
that MGNs are both sensitive and specific in detecting biomarkers
of cancer when conjugated with targeting moieties. In addition, SERS
imaging provides a qualitative assessment of the distribution of both
biomarkers in the cellular environment. We note that due to the possible
colocalization of EGFR and PDL1 on the cell surfaces, a quantitative
evaluation of the distribution of these receptors with SERS maps would
be more challenging and would require sub-10 nm resolution.

Antibody-conjugated theranostic MGNs not only enable high-resolution
cellular mapping of cancer cells but are also ideal for inducing targeted
cell death via PTT. We incubated MDA-MB-231 cells with anti-EGFR–pMBA–MGNs and performed control experiments where
MGNs without antibodies (pMBA–MGNs) were utilized.
Phase contrast images before (Figure 5a) and after incubating with MGNs demonstrated that
cells incubated with anti-EGFR–pMBA–MGNs
(Figure 5b) at 170
μg/mL for 16 h at 37 °C had a higher receptor-specific
uptake relative to cells that were incubated with pMBA–MGNs without any antibodies (Figure 5c). We note that both antibody-conjugated
MGNs and MGNs without antibodies were functionalized with a final
layer of PEG to minimize cellular toxicity and nonspecific binding.
This concentration of 170 μg/mL MGNs was measured by thermogravimetric
analysis32,48 and was determined to be appropriate for
enabling MGNs to be localized on the cell surface and achieve the
necessary temperature increase to allow PTT.34 As a result, this MGN concentration was utilized throughout this
study.

after incubation with anti-EGFR–pMBA–MGNs,
and (f) after incubation with pMBA–MGNs without
antibodies, with incubation times also of 16 h duration.

The increased uptake of anti-EGFR–pMBA–MGNs
in cells clearly shows that (i) EGFR receptors are overexpressed in
MDA-MB-231 cells, as supported by our fluorescence assay in Figure S1, (ii) active targeting of MGNs is enabled
likely by both surface-bound receptors and receptor-mediated endocytosis,49−52 and (iii) MGNs without antibodies have a low passive uptake in cells
within 16 h of incubation.49,53 Unlike the spindle
morphology of the MDA-MB-231 cells, these MCF7 cells have more of
a brick-shaped morphology and tend to grow in closer proximity to
one another (Figure 5d). Phase contrast images clearly demonstrated that MGNs are not
bound to cells either via active targeting (Figure 5e) or via passive uptake (Figure 5f). To further confirm the
specificity of anti-EGFR–pMBA–MGNs,
we incubated them with cocultured MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 cells (Figure S6). Phase contrast images clearly demonstrated
that MGNs preferentially localized along the spindle-shaped MDA-MB-231
cells and minimal binding was observed for the brick-shaped MCF7 cells,
indicating that anti-EGFR–pMBA–MGNs
are highly specific in targeting EGFR high-expressing TNBC cells.
We note that the morphology of both cell lines is unchanged in the
presence of the MGNs and that no cytotoxic effects were observable.

PTT was performed in both MDA-MB-231 cells and control, MCF7, cells,
with anti-EGFR–pMBA–MGNs and pMBA–MGNs (Figure 6). The plasmon resonance of the anti-EGFR–pMBA–MGNs was tuned to overlap with an 808 nm diode
laser utilized for PTT, and the concentration of nanoparticles utilized
was analogous to that used in SERS measurements (170 μg/mL).
All culture dishes were illuminated for 15 min with the 808 nm laser
at 4.7 W/cm2 with a spot size of ∼2 mm × 2
mm. A live/dead cell assay with calcein/propidium iodide (PI) stains
clearly demonstrated that site-specific necrotic cell death was only
observable when EGFR-overexpressing MDA-MB-231 cells were incubated
with anti-EGFR-conjugated MGNs and illuminated with laser (Figure 6a). Cells incubated
with pMBA–MGNs (no antibodies) showed no observable
cell death due to the low passive uptake of MGNs in cells (Figure 6b). Control experiments
with low-EGFR-expressing MCF7 cells also demonstrated no
cell death with both anti-EGFR–pMBA–MGNs
(Figure 6c) and pMBA–MGNs (Figure 6d). PTT with antibody-conjugated MGNs demonstrates
that active targeting enables higher cellular accumulation, minimal
nonspecific binding and off-site toxicities, and a highly specific
and sensitive spatiotemporal control of cell death externally triggered
with low NIR laser powers. Our control experiments also show that
the 808 nm laser alone did not induce any cell death (Figure S7a) and in the absence of laser the anti-EGFR–pMBA–MGNs were not cytotoxic to the cells (Figure S7b).

Localized cell death was observed only with (a) anti-EGFR–pMBA–MGNs, and no cell death was observed with (b) pMBA–MGNs. No cell death was observed for the control
MCF7 cells with (c) anti-EGFR–pMBA–MGNs
and (d) pMBA–MGNs. Note: the necrotic cells
are found only within the laser spot.

Conclusions
In summary, we demonstrate the theranostic capabilities
of MGNs
conjugated with antibodies and Raman tags in vitro by combining multiplexed
diagnosis of immunomarker PDL1 with EGFR in TNBC cells via SERS followed
by PTT to treat the cells. The strong SERS signal enabled by both
electromagnetic and chemical enhancement by MGNs, as well as the narrow
vibrational signatures of Raman, allowed us to create cellular traffic
maps, facilitating a highly sensitive and specific detection of both
biomarkers. Furthermore, the nanoantenna effect with MGNs gives rise
to enhanced light-to-heat conversion when illuminated with NIR light
and subsequent photothermal cell death only within the laser spot,
avoiding off-target toxicities. We envision that the successful detection
of immune checkpoint ligand PDL1 will ultimately enable theranostic
MGNs to provide a quantitative measure of immunomarkers and allow
predictive, personalized image-guided immunotherapies with minimal
toxicity.44,46,54 Furthermore,
this work will impact the design of new theranostic nanoprobes capable
of imaging multiple biomarkers of cancer and light-controlled therapeutic
response, providing an avenue to diagnose TNBC tumors that typically
do not respond to endocrine and targeted treatments.

Materials and
Methods
MGN Synthesis
Reagents purchased from Sigma-Aldrich
include both HEPES and gold(III) chloride trihydrate (HAuCl4) for MGN synthesis. For functionalization, Raman tags, pMBA and
DTNB, were purchased from TCI America Inc.

MGNs were synthesized
through the seedless, one-step HEPES growth protocol, as previously
described.32,34,55 Briefly, 18 mL of Milli-Q (MQ) water (18 MΩ) was added to
12 mL 200 mM HEPES (pH 7.40 ± 0.1), mixing by gentle inversion.
Quickly, 300 μL of 20 mM tetrachloroauric(III) acid (HAuCl4) was added, again mixing by inversion and leaving to react
at room temperature for 75 min. Plasmon resonance of the MGNs, through
the functionalization process, was monitored using a Varian Cary 5000
UV–vis NIR spectrophotometer (Agilent Technologies).

OPSS–PEG–NHS
Ester Chemistry with Antibody
OPSS–PEG–Anti-EGFR
OPSS–PEG–NHS
ester (Mw 2000 g/mol; JenKem Technology)
and human EGF R/ErbB1 antibody (anti-EGFR; R&D Systems) were purchased
in lyophilized forms. Chemistry to form the amide linkage from the
ester group of OPSS–PEG–NHS with amine groups on the
antibody structure was modified and troubleshot from previously reported
methods.56−58 OPSS–PEG–NHS was resuspended in 100
mM pH 8.6 ± 0.1 sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) buffer
to a concentration of 160 mg/mL, only immediately prior to the reaction
with anti-EGFR, as the ester is sensitive to water hydrolysis. Also
reconstituted in 100 mM NaHCO3 (pH 8.6 ± 0.1) buffer,
the anti-EGFR protein was prepared at a concentration of 1 mg/mL.
The higher pH bicarbonate buffer is used for the OPSS–antibody
reaction, as the amide reaction is favored at a higher pH.59−61 Prepared on ice, the 160 mg/mL OPSS-PEGS–NHS solution was
added at a (1:9) volumetric
ratio57 to the 1 mg/mL anti-EGFR: 8 μL
of 160 mg/mL OPSS–PEG–NHS was added to 72 μL of
1 mg/mL anti-EGFR. OPSS–PEG–antibody was reacted for
24 h on an inverter at 4 °C.

OPSS–PEG–Anti-PDL1
Human CD274 (B7-H1,
PDL1) antibody (anti-PDL1; BioLegend) was already resuspended at 1
mg/mL stock in phosphate-buffered solution, pH 7.2. The OPSS–PEG–anti-PDL1
reaction was prepared in the same manner as the OPSS–PEG–anti-EGFR
reaction but then further diluted fivefold with 100 mM NaHCO3 (pH 8.6 ± 0.1) buffer to ensure that the linker–antibody
reaction occurred at the favorable pH 8.6.

Synthesis of
Actively Targeted (Antibody) MGNs (Anti-EGFR–pMBA–MGNs and Anti-PDL1– DTNB–MGNs)
Quantification
of MGNs
At points during the functionalization
process, a known quantity of MGNs was required to allow for proper
labeling efficiencies. To determine MGN concentration, an equation
was developed from previous thermogravimetic analyzer32,48 and UV–vis spectroscopy correlative studies (refer to eq S1). The equation was utilized in calculations
for all functionalized MGN chemistries.

Anti-EGFR–pMBA–MGNs
To begin, 60 mL MGNs at 170 μg/mL
(ext. = 1.79) at max plasmon
resonance ∼780 nm in the NIR region were synthesized. Ideal
for nanomedicine work because of the weak absorption by biological
tissues and proteins, MGN resonance in this regime allows for better
penetration depth during therapy for future in vivo studies.62 MGNs were kept on ice through the functionalization
process. pMBA, dissolved in 100% ethanol, was added to the MGNs in
a small volume with high concentration, adapting from previous methods
for SERS-tag labeling to gold nanoparticles.58,63−65 With slow stirring, 6 μL of 10 mM pMBA was injected to 60 mL of MGNs, mixing for 10 min at 4 °C
and monitoring the shift in resonance due to the binding event via
thiol linkage. Next, the 60 mL was centrifuged at 6000 rpm for 20
min.

The chemistry ratio for OPSS–PEG–antibody
to SERS-tag-MGNs was modified and troubleshot from other literature
methods.56,57,61,66 Briefly, 80 μL of OPSS–PEG–anti-EGFR
([anti-EGFR]Final = 0.5 mg/mL) was added to 5.95 mL of pMBA-labeled-MGNs at 1.14 mg/mL, pipetting to mix. The antibody
with the MGN reaction was then left to react for 24 h on an inverter
at 4 C. Post 24 h incubation, PEGylation chemistry34,67,68 was performed to passivate any free surface
area to negate charge effects by the anti-EGFR–pMBA–MGNs. To the aqueous MGN mixture, 700 μL of 5 μM
PEG–thiol (mPEG-SH, Mw 5000 g/mol;
JenKem Technology) was added and reacted for 10 min at room temperature.
After the reaction, MGNs were then centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 10
min. Pellets were resuspended in 200 μL of sterile 8.6 mM pH
7.40 ± 0.1 monophosphate buffer at 5 mg/mL, rechecking concentration.
For cellular assays, functionalized MGNs were further diluted to 170
μg/mL with normal media [no fetal bovine serum (FBS)] as this
concentration was previously shown to have strong SERS and photothermal
activity.32,34

Anti-PDL1–DTNB–MGNs
To synthesize the
complementary MGNs particles, the functionalization method was repeated
with similar steps but substituting anti-PDL1 as the targeting moiety
and DTNB as the SERS tag.

Synthesis of MGNs Lacking
the Targeting Moiety (pMBA–MGNs)
MGNs without a targeting moiety, but SERS-tagged
and PEG-bound, pMBA–MGNs, were synthesized
via a modified version of previous procedures.34,67,68 pMBA labeling was performed as with anti-EGFR–pMBA–MGN chemistry. For the pegylation step, 50 μM
mPEG-SH was added to 60 mL of pMBA-labeled MGNs,
incubating for 5 min, and centrifuging at 6000 rpm for 20 min. To
be certain of the surface neutrality of the pMBA–MGNs,
a second addition of mPEG-SH was performed. To the aqueous 5.95 mL pMBA-labeled-MGNs at 1.14 mg/mL (ext. = 12.0), 200 μL
of 5 μM mPEG-SH was added in a cold vessel for 10 min with constant
stirring at room temperature. The particles were then centrifuged
at 4000 rpm for 10 min and resuspended in 200 μL of sterile
8.6 mM pH 7.40 ± 0.1 monophosphate buffer.

Characterization
of Antibody-Labeled MGNs
Antibody-tag-MGNs
were imaged with an Osiris TEM at 200 keV to ensure the proper morphology
and functionalization of the particles. Raman spectra of anti-EGFR–pMBA–MGNs, anti-PDL1–DTNB–MGNs, and
a (1:1) mixture were obtained using an inVia Raman microscope (Renishaw)
with a 785 nm wavelength laser source with 1200 lines/mm grating in
high confocal mode.

Fluorescent Secondary Antibody Assay Testing
EGFR Overexpression
in MDA-MB-231 Cells
MDA-MB-231 cells, purchased from ATCC
(HTB-26), were cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s
medium (DMEM; Gibco) supplemented with 10% FBS (ATCC) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin
(Gibco) and maintained at 37 °C and 5% CO2. MDA-MB-231
cells were seeded on a 96-well plate and allowed to grow to ∼90%
confluency. Cells were then fixed with cytofix/cytoperm (BD Biosciences),
incubating for 20 min at room temperature. The fixative was removed,
and the cells were washed with MQ water (×2). Next, the cells
were blocked to prevent any nonspecific binding by incubating with
a 1× animal-free blocking solution (Cell Signaling Technology)
for 1 h at 4 °C. The blocking solution was removed, followed
by washing with MQ water (×2). The cells were then incubated
with human EGF R/ErbB1 antibody (monoclonal mouse anti-EGFR, 100 μg/mL;
R&D Systems) diluted in 8.6 mM pH 7.4 ± 0.1 monophosphate
buffer for 24 h at 4 °C. After 24 h, the cells were washed with
monophosphate buffer (×2) and next incubated with secondary antibody
(mouse IgG2B PE-conjugated, 2 μg/mL; R&D Systems)
for 2 h at 4 °C. The cells were washed with monophosphate buffer
(×2) and then visualized under fluorescent microscopy using a
Zeiss LSM 710 confocal microscope.

TEM Imaging of Surface
Binding and Uptake of Antibody-Labeled
MGNs for MDA-MB-231 Cells
Anti-EGFR–pMBA–MGNs (170 μg/mL) were added to cells at ∼90%
confluency. The cells were further incubated for another 16 h at 37
°C. Next, the cells were washed with cacodylate buffer before
fixing in 2.5% gluteraldehyde in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer. Sample processing
and imaging were handled by the Vanderbilt Cell Imaging Shared Resource.
The samples were postfixed in 1% osmium tetraoxide at room temperature
and then washed with 0.1 M cacodylate buffer (×3). Postfixation,
the samples were dehydrated through a graded ethanol series followed
by incubation in 100% ethanol and propylene oxide (PO) with two exchanges
of pure PO. Finally, cell samples were embedded in epoxy resin and
polymerized at 60 °C for 48 h. For thin section preparation,
ultrathin slices (70–80 nm) were cut from the block and added
to copper grids for imaging. The grids were further stained with 2%
uranyl acetate and lead citrate. Imaging was performed using a Philips/FEI
Tecnai T12 electron microscope operating at 200 keV.

SERS Singleplex
Mapping of MDA-MB-231 Cells (Active vs Passive)
and Control MCF7 Cells
For SERS mapping experiments, MDA-MB-231
or MCF7 cells were seeded on CaF2 disks (20 mm × 2
mm Raman grade; Crystran Ltd.). Cells at ∼90% confluency were
incubated with media (no FBS, nDMEM) supplemented with either 170
μg/mL anti-EGFR–pMBA–MGNs or
170 μg/mL pMBA–MGNs for 16 h at 37 °C.
Next, the cells were washed with nDMEM (×2) and then placed back
in complete media (with FBS, cDMEM) to equilibrate for 2 h at 37 °C.
The cells were then fixed with cytofix/cytoperm (BD Biosciences),
incubating for 20 min at room temperature. The fixative was removed,
and the cells were washed with MQ water (×2).69

Control SERS mapping experiments, MGNs coated with
antibody (anti-EGFR–pMBA–MGNs, 170
μg/mL) and nontargeted MGNs (pMBA–MGNs,
170 μg/mL) experiments, as well as the MCF7 control assay, were
treated the same for SERS mapping and data collection, as well as
processing. After allowing the samples to dry overnight at 4 °C,
the cells on the CaF2 disks were visualized using a Raman
microscope. Using an 100× objective, a video montage of the cells
was captured, and the resulting brightfield image provided x, y coordinates for the Raman instrument
to record SERS chemical footprints of a rectangular area of ∼100
μm × 100 μm. Recording spectra with 0.75 μm
steps, the Raman microscope took measurements of the cells with a
785 nm wavelength laser source with 1200 lines/mm grating in high
confocal mode. Static spectra (1200 cm–1 center)
were recorded using a 100× objective with a ∼1 μm
spot size at a power of 2 mW with a 10 s acquisition time.

SERS Multiplex
Imaging of MDA-MB-231 Cells (No Block and Blocking
PDL1 Receptor)
Multiplex with (1:1) Cocktail with MDA-MB-231
Cells
Again, CaF2 disks were seeded with MDA-MB-231
cells. Cells were incubated
with media (no FBS, nDMEM) supplemented with a 170 μg/mL (1:1)
cocktail of anti-EGFR–pMBA–MGNs to
anti-PDL1–DTNB–MGNs for 16 h at 37 °C. Next, the
cells were washed with nDMEM (×2) and equilibrated for 2 h at
37 °C. After 2 h in cDMEM, the cells were fixed, washed, and
dried overnight at 4 °C.

Measurement conditions for the
multiplex cell studies were the same as those for singleplex except
the use of a lower laser power here at 1 mW.

Multiplex with (1:1) Cocktail
with 231 Cells after Blocking
the PDL1 Receptor
To test the fidelity of the multiplex technology,
a blocking PDL1 receptor control experiment was performed to determine
the specificity and mapping capabilities of this (1:1) cocktail of
functionalized antibody-specific MGNs. MDA-MB-231s were seeded on
CaF2 disks and preblocked by incubating with nDMEM supplemented
with 4 μg/mL human CD274 (B7-H1, PDL1) antibody (monoclonal
anti-PDL1) for 1 h at 37 °C.70−72 After washing and MGN
incubation step for 16 h at 37 °C, the cells were again washed,
equilibrated in cDMEM, fixed, and dried.

Analysis of
SERS Imaging Maps (Singleplex, Multiplex, PDL1 Block)
Using
wire 3.4 software, cosmic ray removal was performed with
the nearest-neighbor method implemented to ensure that the scaling
of the spectra was not jeopardized. A custom code was built using
MATLAB software to perform smoothing and background fluorescent subtraction.
Truncation was first performed, and the data underwent smoothing and
data differentiation using the Savitzsky and Golay method.73−75 The S and G filter used
an order of 5 and a coefficient value of 61. Following the modified
polyfit method,76 an automated approach
was applied to perform background subtraction of fluorescence using
polynomial fitting to uncover SERS peaks even at low-intensity regimes.76 A seventh-order polynomial was utilized for
fluorescent background subtraction through an iterative process with
a threshold of 0.0001. Finally, overlays of SERS intensity maps and
brightfield were performed using Adobe Photoshop graphic software.

Photothermal Ablation of Breast Cancer Cells Utilizing Actively
Targeted MGNs
The MCF7 (HTB-22) breast cancer cell line was
purchased from ATCC. MCF7 cells were cultured in Eagle’s Minimum
Essential medium (EMEM; ATCC) supplemented with 10% FBS (ATCC), 1%
penicillin/streptomycin (Gibco), and 0.01 mg/mL human recombinant
insulin (Invitrogen). Culturing on 35 mm culture dishes for the PTT
experiment, both MDA-MB-231 cells and MCF7s were seeded to reach ∼90%
confluent layers on the day of MGN addition.

The two cell lines
were incubated with new media (no FBS, nDMEM, or nEMEM) supplemented
with either 170 μg/mL anti-EGFR–pMBA–MGNs
or 170 μg/mL pMBA–MGNs for 16 h at 37
°C. Next, the cells (231s and MCF7s) were washed with nDMEM or
nEMEM (×2) and then placed back in complete media (with FBS,
cDMEM, or cEMEM) prior to irradiation with laser. The localization
of anti-EGFR–pMBA–MGNs and pMBA–MGNs was compared for the two cell types through
visualization with a Zeiss Observer Z1 microscope. In addition, anti-EGFR–pMBA–MGNs uptake and localization in the coculture
of MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 cells were observed with a Zeiss Observer Z1
microscope.

Custom PTT laser optics were purchased from Thorlabs,
Inc. and
built to provide controlled light to heat conversion. The optics included
an 808 nm laser diode (L808P1WJ), a current controller (LDC240C),
a thermoelectric controller (TEDC200C), a collimating lens (C230TME-B),
and a silver polished mirror (PF-10-03-P01). The photothermal setup
was also completed with an aluminum block wrapped with antireflecting
black films and a 37 °C heating mantle to simulate biological
conditions. Calipers and a power meter (PM130D; Thorlabs, Inc.) were
used to measure the laser spot size and power.

After allowing
to equilibrate at 37 °C for 2 h, the cells
were illuminated for 15 min at 4.7 W/cm2 pump fluence with
an 808 nm laser and a spot size of 2 mm × 2 mm. The cells were
then placed back in the 37 °C incubator. After 4 h, fresh complete
media was added with calcein AM (5 μM) and PI (1 μM) (live/dead
stain) and incubated for 20 min at 37 °C. A Zeiss LSM 710 confocal
microscope was utilized for fluorescent imaging of the cells. Additional
controls were performed on the MDA-MB-231 cells to show that the 808
nm laser alone did not induce any cell death and that the anti-EGFR–pMBA–MGNs were not cytotoxic to the cells.
