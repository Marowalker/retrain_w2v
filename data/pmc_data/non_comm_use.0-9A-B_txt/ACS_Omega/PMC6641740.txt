We present a sol–gel
processed hematite–titania-based
photoanode, which exhibits a photocurrent of up to 2.5 mA/cm2 at 1.23 VRHE under simulated AM 1.5 G illumination (100
mW/cm2) thanks to the addition of an amorphous cocatalyst
with the nominal composition Fe20Cr40Ni40Ox. To unveil the role of the
cocatalyst interconnected to the photoanode, we performed impedance
measurements. According to the one order of magnitude higher value
for the capacitance associated with surface states (CSS) compared to the bare photoanode, the function of the
catalyst−photoanode interface resembles that of a p−n-like
junction. In addition, the charge transfer resistance associated with
charge transfer processes from surface states (Rct,ss) was unchanged at potentials between 0.8 and 1.1 VRHE after adding the cocatalyst, indicating that the catalyst
has a negligible effect on the hole transport to the electrolyte.
The understanding of the role of oxygen evolution catalysts (OECs)
in conjunction with the photoanodes is particularly important for
water splitting because most OECs are studied separately at considerably
higher potentials compared to the potentials at which photoanode materials
are operated.

Introduction
The urge to replace
fossil fuels by a renewable energy source will
be predominant in this century to limit global warming. Although solar
cells exhibit excellent quantum efficiencies, losses occur when electric
power is stored in batteries to bypass peaks with high power generation.
With direct photoelectrochemical water splitting, one has the clear
advantage to transform sunlight directly into hydrogen, which has
a high energy density per unit weight.1 Compared to those of TiO2 and WO3, hematite
photoanodes exhibit a high theoretically achievable solar-to-hydrogen
efficiency (15.5%) coinciding with its narrow band gap of ca. 2.1
eV.2,3 However, inherent drawbacks such as poor e– and h+ conductivity, low charge carrier mobility and
lifetime, large visible light absorption depth, and slow water oxidation
kinetics limit its performance in reality. These shortcomings, which
lead to increased charge carrier recombination,4,5 have
been addressed by nanostructuring,6 by
constructing hierarchical assemblies,7 by
doping (e.g., with Sn,8−10 Si,11 Mo,12 Cr,12 Pt,13 and Ti14−16), and through the introduction of under- and overlayers
at the back contact17,18 and on top of the photoanodes,
respectively. Ti,19 Si,14,20 Sn,8,10,21 and Pt13,22 turned out to be the most effective dopants; however, minor improvements
were also reported for hematite doped with Mo,12 Mg,23 Ta,24 Nb,23,25 Zn,26 and Ge.27 The introduction of heterojunctions
has been proven to enhance the photoresponse for multiple reasons.
Charge carriers may be transported in a cascade e–/h+ transfer thanks to differently aligned valence and
conduction bands in heterojunction engineered photoanodes. Such a
system was reported for Fe2O3–Fe2TiO5.28 Another reason
might be that hematite is completely transformed into another phase,
for example, through high-temperature annealing, as described for
a WO3–Fe2WO6 photoanode.29 Charge transport was further reported to be
promoted by the introduction of thin layers at the hematite–F:SnO2 contact. In this case, the beneficial effects depend on the
type of the layer. Whereas a SiOx coating
indirectly leads to improved morphology by acting as a seeding layer
for the subsequently deposited hematite layer,30 the role of Nb2O5 underlayers is
attributed to a “hole-mirror” effect and hence inhibits
recombination.31 Moreover, such ultrathin
(1–2 nm) underlayers enable n/p-type32 doping at the interfaces upon annealing, comparable to Sn doping
at the hematite–F:SnO2 interface detected after
high-temperature treatments, thus improving charge transfer.33 Improvements in conductivity regarding hematite-based
photoanodes were also achieved by “disorder engineering”
upon annealing under reducing conditions. The photocurrent enhancement
through hydrogen (plasma) reduction is highly dependent on the process
parameters and intends to avoid the formation of Fe3O4 responsible for dramatic performance lowering.34 Wet chemical reduction with “H”
sources also leads to a pronounced improvement of the performance,
which is attributed to surface engineering of the hematite photoanode,
underlining the importance to differentiate between beneficial surface
and adverse bulk effects of reduced α-Fe2O3 containing Fe2+ impurities.35

Generally, hematite-based photoanodes show a rather high onset
potential, attributed to intrinsic surface states, which pin the Fermi
level and cause a fixed barrier height. Consequently, the degree of
band bending, which in turn is positively correlated with e–/h+ separation, is dictated by the density and energy
distribution of surface states.36,37 Attempts to reduce
the negative impacts of surface states and thus to lower the flat
band potential (Efb) include high-temperature
annealing,16 long annealing times,38 or surface modifications with fluoride39 or zinc ions.40 Moreover,
passivation of surface states was realized with ultrathin coatings
of Al2O317 and Ga2O3.18

Oxygen evolution
catalysts (OECs) in turn facilitate hole transfer
to the electrolyte, whereas both effects, passivation of surface states
and acceleration of hole transfer, lead to a cathodic shift in the
onset potential.17 The activity of a cocatalyst
depends also on the photoanode itself, that is, the interface states
need to be considered.41 Additionally,
the phase composition of the cocatalyst determines its functionality.
A good example is represented by cobalt phosphate (“Co-Pi”),
which is among the most studied oxygen evolution catalysts. Its role
as a catalyst in hematite photoanodes has been debated for a long
time. The enhancement in performance was assigned to an acceleration
of water oxidation, whereas other researchers attributed the cathodic
shift to an increase of the space charge layer width of the photoanode.42 Another study links the performance improvement
to a catalytic effect, in which a Co(OH)2/Co3O4 layer on hematite accelerated water oxidation.43 These contradictory results stem from the fact
that the function of the catalysts is presumably dependent on the
nature of the photoanode underneath, that is, its porosity, donor
density, surface quality, and consequently the energy distribution
and density of surface states. Moreover, the preparation history of
the cocatalyst itself and the resulting phase composition may determine
whether or not such an overlayer acts in a truly catalytic manner
as a water oxidation catalyst (acceleration of hole transfer to the
solution),43 as an adaptive junction (electrolyte
permeable electrocatalyst),44 as a passivation
layer (removing surface recombination centers),17,18 or as a p/n-type heterojunction45 attributed
to desirable charge separation.

A plethora of studies have been
conducted on various oxygen evolution
catalysts (OECs). The “library” of solid OECs ranges
from single materials, such as Ni (although only active when traces
of Fe are present);46 Fe-,47 Co-,48,49 and Mn oxides;50−52 carbon nanotubes;53 and IrO254 to binary compositions with Ni–Co,55 Ni–Fe,56−58 Co–Fe,59 and composites
thereof with gold60 and reduced graphene
oxide (rGO).61 Not surprisingly, multicomponent
materials usually outperform single compounds thanks to synergistic
effects. For example, electronegative Au facilitates the formation
of active Co4+ sites46 and rGO
enhances the conductivity.61 Similar effects
are also reported for Fe–Ni mixtures as a result of electronic
interactions between the two metals, where Ni supports the formation
of Fe4+, thus contributing to the activation of Fe in Ni–Fe
electrocatalysts.58,62 Generally, a trade-off between
stability and activity is reported for noble metal oxides with respect
to their porosity and degree of crystallinity. The least crystalline
and most porous OEC was found to be the most active but also prone
to dissolution, thereby decreasing the long-term stability.63

In this contribution, we present a hematite–titania
photoanode
covered with a catalyst fabricated by a simple spin-coating process.
The hematite–titania composite layer was prepared by liquid
phase processing using preformed nanoparticles with defined size,
crystallinity, and shape. The improved activity compared to that of
bare hematite stems from the incorporation of Ti, resulting in the
formation of a Fe2O3–Fe2TiO5 heterojunction.64 The photoanode
is further modified with an amorphous ternary Fe–Ni-based cocatalyst65,66 with nominal composition “Fe20Ni40Cr40Ox”, which was previously
shown by Gerken et al.67 to be a promising
material with respect to oxygen evolution characteristics. Most studies
on OECs are conducted in the dark in the oxygen evolution potential
range. However, we wanted to gain further insights into the interplay
between photoanodes and catalysts; therefore, we studied our system
at potentials (e.g., 0.8–1.1 VRHE) at which photoanode
materials are usually operated. Impedance spectroscopy measurements
revealed that the reason for the drastic improvement of the performance
upon adding the photocatalyst layer on top of the photoanode does
not stem from accelerated hole transfer to the electrolyte but is
due to the formation of a p/n-type junction at the photoanode–catalyst
interface.

Results and Discussion
Voltammetric and Efficiency Measurements
The performance
of the hematite–titania photoanodes could be drastically improved
after the addition of the overlayer with nominal composition “Fe20Cr40Ni40Ox”, as depicted by voltammetric measurements in Figure 1.

Figure 1 Photocurrent density
of a Fe2O3–TiO2 photoanode
before and after the addition of an amorphous
overlayer with nominal composition “Fe20Cr40Ni40Ox” measured in
1 M NaOH under simulated AM 1.5 G illumination (100 mW/cm2).

The observed changes, such as
a cathodic shift in the range of
about 80–100 mV in the onset potential of the illuminated photoanodes
and the increase in photocurrent by about 25% on average motivated
us to perform a detailed study on the interplay of catalysts and photoactive
layers. First, the amorphous overlayer comprises a surprisingly good
stability as the photocurrent of the multilayer photoanode proved
to be stable over the course of 24 h (Figure S4, Supporting Information (SI)). An increase
was also observed with respect to the incident photon-to-current efficiency
(IPCE) of the photoanodes. The overlayer improved the maximum IPCE
value from ca. 25 to 40% between 300 and 330 nm, as represented in Figure 2. The efficiency
enhancement is less pronounced in the visible range and accounts for
about 10% improvement between 400 and 500 nm, whereas at longer wavelengths,
the enhancement is negligible. In addition, the catalyst layer shows
no parasitic light absorption, which enables nearly full light penetration
of the photoanode (Figure S5, SI).

Figure 2 Incident photon-to-current efficiency of a bare
Fe2O3–TiO2 and an overlayered
Fe2O3–TiO2 photoanode, measured
in 1 M NaOH under
simulated AM 1.5 G illumination at a potential of 1.4 VRHE.

The chopped light scan (Figure 3) reveals that the
cathodic photocurrent decay is much
higher for “over-Fe2O3–TiO2” as compared to that for the bare photoanode at low
potentials, whereas the trend reverses between 1.0 and 1.2 VRHE. The cathodic photocurrent decays are of about the same magnitude
in “bare-Fe2O3–TiO2” over the entire voltage range. The cathodic transient photocurrent
decay can be ascribed to three different recombination pathways: (i)
accumulation of holes near the surface, (ii) accumulation of electrons
in the bulk, or (iii) trapping of e– or h+ at surface states.68 Backside illumination
of the bare photoanode showed that the photocurrent is nearly identical
or even slightly lower (Figure S1, SI). Therefore, accumulation of electrons in
the bulk can be ruled out. In the work of Du et al.69 and Jang et al.,70 the open
circuit potentials in the dark are anodically shifted after depositing
the NiFeOx overlayer. The cathodic shift
under illumination was understood to result from a greater photovoltage
generation; thus, the increase in photocurrent was attributed to improved
thermodynamics, rather than improved oxygen evolution kinetics. Moreover,
the photocurrent enhancement throughout the entire potential range
could point toward improved thermodynamic processes.

(100 mW/cm2).

Impedance Measurements
To unveil the role of the overlayer
regarding charge transfer processes and capacitances, we performed
impedance measurements (Figure 4). Because the surface of the photoanodes is sensitive to
surface quality losses during impedance measurements, two similarly
performing bare-Fe2O3–TiO2 photoanodes were used and only one was overlayered. First, we performed
Mott–Schottky analysis (in the dark) to determine Efb and the donor density (ND). The Nyquist plots (Figure S9, SI) were fitted to a Randles circuit, and the
potential-dependent capacitances were plotted according to the Mott–Schottky
equation  where ND is the
donor density (m–3), A is the electrode
area (m2), e is the elementary charge
(1.60 × 10−19 C), Efb is the flat band potential (V), ε is the vacuum permittivity
(8.85 × 10–12 F m–1), εr is the relative dielectric constant of hematite (εr = 60),71k is
the Boltzmann constant (1.38 × 10–23 J K–1), and T is the absolute temperature
(in K). The slope is inversely proportional to ND, meaning that the larger the doping, the smaller the slope.
The analysis of the slope for the bare-Fe2O3–TiO2 photoanode shows that the donor density (ND) is about 3.19 × 1018 cm–3, whereas a donor density of about 2.12 × 1018 cm–3 was measured for over-Fe2O3–TiO2 (Table S1, SI). The slightly lower value obtained
for the overlayered photoanode suggests that the donor density dropped.
From the intersect of 1/C2 at the x-axis, Efb can be obtained
(Figure S8, Table S1, SI). The values for over-Fe2O3–TiO2 and bare-Fe2O3–TiO2 are 0.68 and 0.66 V, respectively (Table S1, SI). The standard deviation suggests
that these two photoanodes do not significantly differ, indicating
that the enhanced performance is not due to a shift in the flat band
potential. Assuming that charge transfer occurs predominantly via
surface states and due to the fact that the contribution of the Helmholtz
capacitance (CH) can be neglected, because ND is well below 1020 cm–3, the circuit shown in Figure S10 (SI) was used and proved to be a good estimation
for the surface state capacitance (Css), the bulk capacitance (Cbulk), the
surface charge transfer resistance (Rct,ss), and the trapping resistance (Rtrapping).68,72

Figure 4 Resistances and capacitances associated with
charge trapping (Rtrapping) and transfer
(Rct,ss, Css) at different applied
potentials for the bare and the overlayered photoanode as obtained
upon fitting the respective Nyquist plots (Figures S11 and S12, SI) to the equivalent
circuit (EC) shown in Figure S10, SI. Resistance and capacitance values obtained
from fitting are listed in Tables S2 and S3, SI. The measurements were performed
in 1 M NaOH under simulated AM 1.5 G illumination. Error bars stem
from the goodness of the fittings. Note: The measured Fe2O3–TiO2 photoanode exhibited a slightly
lower performance as compared to that of the photoanode shown in Figures 1–3.

Impedance measurements
of the illuminated samples were performed
in the potential range between 0.8 and 1.1 VRHE. As expected,
the bulk capacitance (Cbulk) is not significantly
influenced by the addition of the overlayer (Figure S15, SI). The similar Rct,ss value for both photoanodes (Figure 4) proposes that the charge transfer to the
aqueous electrolyte is not improved by the overlayer. However, the Css value for over-Fe2O3–TiO2 is substantially higher, namely, by approximately
1 order of magnitude compared to that for bare-Fe2O3–TiO2. Furthermore, the peak of Css is consistent with the inflection potential
in the photocurrent curve. If the “Fe20Cr40Ni40Ox” layer acted
as a true water oxidation catalyst, a lowering of Css would have been expected.43 Furthermore, Css is much higher over
the entire potential range, which suggests that the photocurrent improvement
stems mainly from the capability of the catalyst to store holes, representing
a thermodynamic improvement.

NiFeOx–hematite heterostructures
are assumed to form a p/n-type junction, as stated by Zandi et al.,73 owing to the improved turn-on photovoltage as
a result of the addition of the catalyst.70 Moreover, in our case, Rtrapping is
slightly lower after coating the photoanode. This supports the observation
made by Du et al.69 that FeNiOx-type overlayers on hematite are able to reduce Fermi
level pinning. A lower Rtrapping value
indicates that the catalyst thus extracts holes located in the traps
created by surface states in the hematite–titania layer. Induced
by the addition of titania, these traps are presumably located few
hundred millivolts more negative than the valence band position of
the hematite–titania composite.64

Microstructural and Composition Effects
Impedance measurements
performed by Morales-Guio et al.74 on samples
with Fe/Ni = 70:30 revealed a Css and Rct,ss value decrease upon photoelectrodeposition
on hematite, pointing toward an acceleration of water oxidation kinetics.
In our case, the Fe–Ni-type catalyst additionally contains
chromium (Fe/Ni/Cr = 58:24:40, Table S4, SI), which is leaching out upon electrolysis
at least from the outermost surface as confirmed by X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS) and secondary-ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) analyses
(Figures S7, S13, and S14, SI), as expected when looking at Pourbaix diagrams.75 The removal of chromium from the top of the
catalyst layer increases the surface roughness67 and may promote permeability of the catalyst by the electrolyte,
thereby reducing the potential drop at the catalyst–electrolyte
interface.44 The loss of Cr and the change
in intensity of the Ni 2p photopeaks (XPS) further suggest that the
catalyst layer rearranges upon polarization (Figure S7, SI). In a study by Gerken et
al., the composition Fe20Ni40Cr40Ox was among those with the highest roughness
factors.67 Only earth alkaline metal-containing
compositions outperformed the composition Fe20Ni40Cr40Ox in terms of roughness
factor according to a screening of different catalysts.67 Compared to that in a dense catalyst, no potential
drop across the Helmholtz layer is expected to occur because the electronic
charge is compensated by the coupled ion motion in the electrolyte.44

Oxygen evolution measurements (Figure 5) were performed
to study the effect of the catalyst on the Faradaic efficiency. The
Faradaic efficiency is measured with respect to the photocurrent,
which directly allows us to gain further insights into the ability
of the catalyst to evolve oxygen. Indeed, the Faradaic efficiency
rises by about 9%, pointing toward the ability of the catalyst to
improve the oxygen evolution kinetics. Although the main improvement
in photocurrent is linked to thermodynamic effects, as found by impedance
spectroscopy, one has to keep in mind that the oxygen evolution was
measured at a potential of 1.23 VRHE, whereas the impedance
analysis was performed at potentials between 0.8 and 1.1 VRHE. The more the anodic potential, the stronger the oxidative power of holes becomes. Thus, effects
such as partial charge transfer activation in the “Ni–O–Fe”
bond facilitates stabilization of redox shuttles, which are supposed
to drive the water oxidation.58,76 Regarding the implementation
of such a photoanode into a tandem cell, the observations made at
low potential are important because the operating point for tandem
cells, depending on the band gap and band position, usually lies in
the lower potential range.74

Figure 5 Oxygen evolution
measurements of a bare Fe2O3–TiO2 (right) and an overlayered Fe2O3–TiO2 photoanode (left) performed
in 1 M NaOH under simulated AM 1.5 G illumination at a potential of
1.23 VRHE.

Conclusions
The addition of a NiFe-type catalyst layer
significantly raised
the photocurrent over the entire voltage range, and a minor cathodic
shift for the onset potential of about 80–100 mV was observed.
The photocurrents plateau above 1.3 VRHE and increased
from ca. 1.9 to 2.5 mA/cm2 at 1.23 VRHE after
the addition of the catalyst layer. The cathodic current transient
revealed the charge decay to be higher in the lower potential range
(0.8–1.0 VRHE), but only with the deposited overlayer,
pointing toward the ability of the catalyst to hold charges. Indeed,
impedance analysis showed that the surface state capacitance (Css) increased by one order of magnitude, whereas
the charge transfer resistance (Rct,ss) remained unchanged when compared to that of the bare photoanode,
thus confirming the hole storage capability of the catalyst layer.
Moreover, the slightly reduced trapping resistance (Rtrapping) indicates that the catalyst layer is able to
efficiently extract holes from surface states of the hematite–titania
photoanode. On the other hand, oxygen measurements at 1.23 VRHE unveiled a slightly better Faradaic efficiency after addition of
the catalyst, possibly as a result of the higher applied potential
compared to that in the impedance analysis. Thus, at higher potentials the oxidative
power of the holes increases and the catalyst becomes more active
toward OER.

Amorphous materials are prone to destabilization,
which could be
confirmed here after prolonged (48 h) electrolysis. Accordingly, it
remains a trade-off to simultaneously optimize both functionalities,
namely, high activity and long-term stability. At the same time, we
need to emphasize that the conclusions drawn from our work cannot
simply be extended to other photoactive materials because the functionality
of the catalyst layer is not only dependent on its composition, porosity,
and crystallinity but also on the photoactive material underneath.
Nevertheless, our study provides a basis for understanding the interplay
between photoactive materials and catalysts and may pave the way for
further improvements, for example, by the addition of a catalyst that
accelerates hole transfer to the solution at lower potentials.

Experimental
Section
Preparation of Amorphous Iron Oxide Nanoparticles
A
microwave-assisted nonaqueous sol–gel route using Fe(acac)3 (Sigma-Aldrich, ≥99.9%), benzyl alcohol (Sigma-Aldrich,
anhydrous, 99.8%), and 1,3-propanediol (Alfa Aesar, 99%) was pursued
as described in detail in ref (64). The particle size ranges from 2 to 4 nm according to a
previously performed transmission electron microscopy analysis.77 The amorphous iron oxide nanoparticles were
dispersed in methanol at a concentration of approximately 65 mg mL–1.

Preparation of Titania Nanoparticles
The approximately
4 nm sized anatase titania nanoparticles were obtained using an oil
bath synthesis. First, TiCl4 (Aldrich, 99.9%) was dissolved
in ethanol (Aldrich, ≥99.8%), followed by addition of BnOH
and 1,3-propanediol. A detailed synthesis procedure can be found in
ref (64).

Preparation
of Nanostructured Hematite–Titania Photoanodes
Hematite–titania
photoanodes were prepared by spin-coating
mixed dispersions of amorphous iron oxide and anatase TiO2 nanoparticles on F/SnO2 substrates (7 Ω/sq, Solaronix)
with a TiO2 content of Ti (mol %)/[Ti (mol %) + Fe (mol
%)] = 12%. The films were annealed at 750 °C at a ramp of 20
°C/min in a pure oxygen atmosphere for 20 min, followed by quenching
in air. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) analysis showed
that the atomic percentage of Ti was 10.13% (Figure S16, SI). The hematite–titania
photoanode without overlayer is abbreviated as bare-Fe2O3–TiO2.

Preparation of the Hematite–Titania-Fe20Cr40Ni40Ox Photoanodes
The preparation of the overlayers was inspired
by the deposition
process used by Smith et al.,66 however
performed in a slightly different way: 2-ethylhexanoates of Fe3+ (50 wt % in mineral spirits, Alfa Aesar, 214 μL),
Cr3+ (70 wt % in mineral spirits, ABCR Chemicals, 273 μL),
and Ni2+ (78 wt % in 2-ethylhexanoic acid, ABCR Chemicals,
184 μL) were dissolved in 7.6 mL of n-heptane
(ACROS, >99%, extra dry), stirred for 2 h, and then centrifuged
at
4000 rpm for 15 min to remove agglomerates prior to deposition. The
solution was spin-coated on a hematite–titania photoanode at
3000 rpm for 60 s. The overlayered photoanode was then dried on a
hot plate at 150 °C for 1 h. Infrared spectroscopy was employed
to follow the thermochemical decomposition of the precursors. After
the heat treatment, the C–H (2800–3000 cm–1) and C=O (∼1680 cm–1) vibrations
disappeared, as shown for KBr disks coated with the precursor solution
(Figure S6, SI). The thicknesses of the hematite–titania films and the OEC
layers were in the range of 180–200 nm and about 100 nm, respectively,
as determined by cross-sectional scanning electron microscopy (SEM)
analysis (Figure S2, SI). However, after electrolysis, the thickness of the overlayer
decreased drastically to <20 nm, as estimated by cross-sectional
SEM analysis (Figure S3, SI). It is assumed that the catalyst covered the entire surface
of the porous photoanode. Elemental analysis of the precursor solution
used for the deposited catalysts revealed a Fe/Ni/Cr atomic ratio
of about 58:24:40 (Table S4, SI). The abbreviation over-Fe2O3–TiO2 stands for the hematite–titania
photoanode overlayered with such a FeNiCrOx layer.

Optical, Structural, and Morphological Film Characterization
and Photoelectrochemical Measurements
X-ray photoelectron
spectra (XPS) were recorded on a Sigma 2 spectrometer (Thermo scientific)
using a nonmonochromatic Al Kα X-ray source, where the binding
energy was calibrated taking C 1s = 284.8 eV. EDX was performed on
a Hitachi SU-70 scanning electron microscope operated at an acceleration
voltage of 15 kV (Schottky-type field emission gun) and equipped with
a X-Max 80 detector (Oxford Instruments). SEM analysis was performed
on a Carl Zeiss LEO 1530 microscope equipped with a field emission
gun operating at 3 kV. For the cross-sectional images, the photoanode
was cut in the middle with a diamond knife. Fourier transform infrared
(FT-IR) spectroscopy was performed on a Spectrum 100 FT-IR spectrometer
using a KBr pellet with the following acquisition parameters: range
4000 to 600 cm–1, resolution of 4.00 cm–1, scan speed of 0.2 cm/s, and the number of scans was 30. UV–vis
spectra were obtained using a JASCO V-660 spectrophotometer with an
ILN-725 integrating sphere accessory. Because the same sample was
used for all measurements, no background correction was made. The
acquisition parameters were as follows: scan speed 400 nm/min, change
source at 340 nm, light source D2/WI, filter exchange step, correction
baseline, vertical axis %T, and data interval 0.5
nm. Photoelectrochemical (PEC) measurements were carried out with
a VMP3 BioLogic potentiostat. Simulated AM 1.5 G solar irradiation
was provided by an Oriel solar simulator equipped with a 300 W Xe
lamp and fitted with an AM 1.5 G filter. Light intensity was measured
with a calibrated reference cell (Oriel, 91150V) and adjusted to 100
mW/cm2 with a neutral density filter (Newport, FS–ND).
The surface area illuminated on the photoelectrode was 0.28 cm2. Measurements were performed at a scan rate of 10 mV/s. The
potential was transformed to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)
with the following equation  The pH of the electrolyte (1 M NaOH) was assumed
to be 13.6, and the potential of the Ag/AgCl/KCl/sat. KCl reference
electrode (Radiometer Analytical) was 0.197 V. Incident photon-to-current
efficiency (IPCE) measurements were carried out in 1 M NaOH at 0.4
V versus Ag/AgCl/sat. KCl using a 1000 W Xe lamp coupled with a monochromator.
A Si photodetector (Optronic Laboratories) was used to measure irradiance
at each selected wavelength. IPCE was calculated with the following
equation  (Photo)electrochemical impedance
spectroscopy
(EIS) data was acquired with an AC perturbation of 10 mV in amplitude
and in the 100 mHz to 1 MHz frequency range, both in the dark and
under illumination and under selected direct current potentiostatic
conditions (0.7–1.4 VRHE). Nyquist plots (imaginary
vs real components of impedance, −ZIm vs ZRe) were fitted to the corresponding
equivalent circuits using EC-Lab software (Bio-Logic, v10.44). Fitted
resistances and capacitances are referred to the electrode real surface,
and a roughness factor of ca. 20 for mesoporous hematite is taken
according to Kay et al.11 Error bars stem
from the goodness of the fittings. Oxygen was detected quantitatively
using a PyroScience fluorescence based oxygen sensor (OXB430-OI).
The cell was filled with 1 M NaOH and degassed with argon prior to
the measurements. The oxygen probe was inserted through a rubber septum,
and continuous O2 readings were conducted at 1 s interval
throughout the experiment. The probe was calibrated using 2 points
(argon: 0% O2 and air: 20.9% O2) with an error
of 5% on the reading. Prior to the experiment, the baseline was measured
for 30 min, followed by 10 min illumination with simulated AM 1.5
G irradiation (100 mW/cm2) at 1.23 VRHE. Oxygen
leakage was subtracted by measuring the leakage rate before and after
the measurement. Secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) with high
depth resolution was performed by means of a time-of-flight-mass spectrometer
from Tofwerk AG (model C-TOF) integrated on a focused ion beam instrument
(Lyra FIB) from Tescan. Low-impact-energy (5 keV) Ga+ ions
with a primary ion current of 180 pA were used for the elemental separation
of the different layers.
