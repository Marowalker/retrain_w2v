magnetic resonance, UV–vis, cyclic voltammetry, and photoluminescent
angle dependency, and the emissive properties of each are described.

Introduction
In the search for efficient
light-emitting devices, organic light-emitting
diodes (OLEDs) offer a full-spectrum inexpensive option because of
the development of heavy atom emitters. Spin–orbit coupling
(SOC) is strong in third-row elements and allows for theoretical device
efficiency to be near unity by utilizing both singlet and triplet
excitons for light generation.1,2 Ir complexes have been
successful thus far, thanks to room-temperature (rt) emission, strong
SOC that allows efficient phosphorescence from its3 MLCT state, μs time range excited state lifetime,
and high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY).3−6

Ir(III) emitters exhibiting
emission of every color, especially
green and red, have been synthesized to date. Concerning green OLEDs,
emitters such as Ir(ppy)2(acac) (Figure 1) have delivered up to 54% external quantum
efficiency (EQE) in devices.7 Complexes
such as Ir(MDQ)2(acac) (Figure 1) (MDQ = methyldibenzo[f,h]quinoxaline) can
provide >20% EQE in red-emitting OLED devices.8 Quinoline-based ligands are better electron acceptors than
pyridine
because of the resonance stabilization energy of the phenyl moiety.9 Furthermore, the additional π electrons
and reduced donation power of the quinoline moiety in comparison to
pyridine contribute to the stabilization of the emissive triplet state.

Figure 1 Structures
of state-of-the-art iridium complexes and iridium complexes
investigated in this study.

Emitters in the blue region, however, have been rare because
of
the high-energy excited state.5 The current
state- of- the- art blue emitters have structures such as (dfppy)2Ir(pic), called FIrPic) [dfppy = 2-(2,4-difluorophenyl)pyridine
and pic = picolinate],10,11 Ir(1-Aryl-NHC)3,12 [NHC = N-heterocyclic carbene],
or Ir(2-arylimidazole)3, as in Ir816 (Figure 1)].13,14 Each class of emitters has its drawbacks, such as low color purity,
poor stability, or poor tunability. With FirPic, for example, the
strongly electron-withdrawing difluorophenyl moiety stabilizes the
molecular ground state (with electron density primarily on the cyclometallated
phenyl ring) more than the excited state (with electron density primarily
on the pyridine ring).15,16 Such energy level tuning widens
the highest occupied molecular orbital–lowest unoccupied molecular
orbital (HOMO–LUMO) gap, thus increasing emission energy to
the blue region. Selective functionalization of either cyclometallating
phenyl or picolinate ligand has been shown to modify emission energy,
PLQY, excited state lifetime, and so forth.

In homoleptic (1-Aryl-NHC)
iridium complexes, sufficiently withdrawing
NHC moieties can harbor a high-energy excited state, leading to blue
emission. However, in homoleptic (2-arylimidazole) iridium complexes,
the excited state lies on the wingtip aryl moiety, leading to blue
emission.17 Both these types of complexes
are synthetically more challenging to modify than arylpyridine complexes.
Accordingly, many fewer studies have investigated the chemistry of
these high-performing ligands,18,19 especially in heteroleptic
complexes.20,21 The goal of this investigation
was to develop a deeper understanding of emitter structure–property
relationships in green- to red-emitting heteroleptic 1-arylimidazole
iridium complexes. We report the synthesis and characterization of
a series of functionalized heteroleptic bis(2-arylimidazole) iridium(III)
picolinate complexes and indicate photophysical ramifications for
ligand functionalization. This manuscript has been previously deposited
on ChemRxiv.22

Results and Discussion
Synthesis
of Iridium Complexes
To experimentally establish
a structure–function relationship for this class of ligands,
we envisioned a series of complexes with functionalization on both
wingtip and cyclometallating phenyl moieties (Scheme 1). Wingtip-modified ligands were reached
by first synthesizing the appropriate imidazole with reproducible
yields of nearly 50% and then coupling the appropriate aryl bromide
through a key Negishi coupling reaction. This procedure reproducibly
yielded each of the imidazole ligands 3–5 with
good yields of 65–87%.

Scheme 1 Synthesis of Ir Complexes 6–14
After forming chloride-bridged
iridium dimers with each ligand
at high temperatures in acceptable yields of 52–80%, heteroleptic
picolinate complexes were obtained after ligation with commercially
available picolinate ligands to form complexes 9–12 with yields between 15 and 92%.

After synthesis and chromatography,
X-ray quality single crystals
of complexes 11, 12, and 14 were grown from a concentrated solution of CDCl3, and
the solved structures are shown in Figure 2. Details of single-crystal X-ray diffraction
(SC-XRD) experiments are given in the Supporting Information, along with CIF files. In the crystal structure
of each complex, the Ir atom adopts the expected distorted octahedral
geometry. Planar 2-arylimidazole ligands are perpendicular with chelating
nitrogen atoms opposite to each other, which is also observed in (ppy)2Ir(pic) complexes.23,24 Bond angles and distances
were typical of other Ir(III) structures in a distorted octahedral,
with no significant steric interactions.

determined structures of
complexes 11 (left), 12 (center), and 14 (right) (thermal probability ellipsoids are drawn at the
50% probability level). Hydrogen atoms and solvated molecules are
omitted for clarity.

Optoelectronic Characterization
Once the complexes
were synthesized, we characterized them by cyclic voltammetry to better
understand the structure–function relationship (Table 1, Figure 3). Complex 10, with the least-accepting
cyclometallating ligand, had the most destabilized ground state oxidation
potential (E(S+/S)) value, while complex 11, with the least-accepting wingtip functionality, showed
no change compared to complex 9 with the unmodified ligand.

onset of the emission spectrum and converting to eV using the formula E(T) = 1240 (eV/nm)/λonset (nm).

M Bu4NPF6 in MeCN solution with the glassy carbon

Pt reference electrode, and Pt counter electrode with ferrocene as
an internal standard. Values estimated by taking Epa and are reported versus NHE.

d Value obtained from the equation EHOMO = −4.6 eV – E(S+/S).

e Value estimated
by adding EHOMO and the E(T1).

This indicated that modification of the wingtip aryl
group does
not affect the molecular ground state. Complex 14, with
the most accepting picolinate ancillary ligand, displayed the most
stabilized E(S+/S) at 1.11 V versus NHE.
Decreasing the electron-accepting power of the picolinate complex
through substitution with more inductive and resonance donating functional
groups as in complexes 9, 12, and 13 led to successively most destabilized E(S+/S) values (from 1.12 for 12, 1.13 for 9, and 1.18 for 13), which indicated that the
picolinate directly affected the molecular ground state energy, as
is the case for FIrPic and its derivatives.

To understand how
structural changes affected emission, we measured
the UV–vis and photoluminescence of each complex dissolved
in MeCN (Table 1, Figure 4). Overall, the UV–vis
absorbance spectra looked qualitatively similar for each of the complexes,
as was expected. Looking more closely at the spectra, subtle differences
are apparent.

Figure 4 UV–vis and normalized photoluminescence spectra
of complexes 9–14 dissolved in Ar-saturated MeCN.

For instance, compared to complex 9 (unmodified ligand),
decreasing the electron-accepting power of the cyclometallating ligand
(complex 10) increased absorptivity, whereas modifying
the imidazole wingtip (complex 11) decreased absorptivity.
Modifying the picolinate ligand with methoxy functionality largely
had no effect on absorptivity, whereas trifluoromethyl functionalization
increased absorptivity and introduced a pronounced band at 460 nm.

The steady-state photoluminescence spectra of complexes 9–14 in MeCN were measured to understand the changes
to the emissive state upon ligand modification. Adding electron density
to the cyclometallating ligand led to a slight red shift in the emission
spectra λmax value (577 nm for 10 vs
571 nm for 9), whereas modifying the imidazole wingtip
had no effect on λmax (complex 11 vs 9).

Modifying the picolinate ligand was found to have
a much more drastic
effect, as increasing picolinate-accepting power led to an 83 nm red
shift (654 nm for complex 13 vs 571 nm for 9). Decreasing accepting power through the addition of methoxy or
methyl led to a less-pronounced blue shift (17 nm) for both complexes
(complexes 12 and 14 vs complex 9). From the photoluminescence data, it is clear that picolinate ligand
modifications affect emission more than absorption, and that the emission
energy can be easily tuned by modifying the picolinate electron donating
and accepting strengths. Because of its intrinsic accepting ability,
the LUMO likely has high electron density on the picolinate ligand,
as was previously described for very similar complexes of (ppy)2Ir(pic) derivatives.24 Photoluminescence
data support this hypothesis because emission energy should be lowered
by increasing the accepting power of the LUMO-bearing moiety.16

Thus, from the electrochemical measurements,
it appeared that the
molecular HOMO (E(S+/S)) was likely localized
on the Ir and the cyclometallating moiety of the imidazole ligand
(as has been observed in calculations of homoleptic complexes).17 The optical measurements indicate that the emissive
triplet state (E(T1))
is likely composed of a mixed MLCT state, with very little ligand-centered
triplet state character in the emissive state, as evidenced by the
featureless charge transfer band present for each complex.11

The energy levels of complexes 9–14 are compiled
in Figure 5 for comparison.
From the graph, the ramifications of ligand modification are easier
to visualize, especially in the context of band gap energy. For instance,
adding electron density to the cyclometallating ligand in complex 10 destabilized the E(S+/S) energy
level more than E(LUMOest), lowering the
band gap energy. Conversely, in complexes 12 and 13, the E(S+/S) level was slightly
destabilized, but E(LUMOest) was destabilized to a greater
degree, leading to overall band gap widening. In complex 13, both E(S+/S) and E(LUMOest) were stabilized, with much more stabilization
occurring at the E(LUMOest) energy level.

Figure 5 Energy-level
diagram for complexes 9–14. The E(S+/S) energy level was measured by cyclic voltammetry,
and the value was converted to the vacuum scale by the equation E(HOMO) (eV) = −4.6 – E(S+/S) (V vs NHE). The ELUMOest energy level
estimated as the high-energy onset of emission in degassed MeCN. The
optical band gap value is the difference between the EHOMO and ELUMOest energy levels.

Once we had measured the relevant energy levels for each
of the
emitters, we then turned to gaining a better understanding of photophysical
properties of the complexes in solution and in a variety of matrices.
Our first set of measurements involved PLQY (Φ) data for the
complexes (Table 2).
While not an IUPAC standard, we chose to reference our PLQY values
in solution to a state-of-the-art emitter we had readily available,
FIrPic (PLQY = 92% in dichloroethane, DCE).26,27

As has been
described for a series of recently published heteroleptic
phenylpyridine acetylene-substituted picolinates, the observed PLQY
values in solution were much lower than those for FIrPic but similar
to those for Ir(ppy)2(pic) (14.7%).24 In the reported Ir(ppy)2(pic) complexes, solution
excited state lifetime measurements were not indicative of the pure
radiative lifetime (τ0), and so, we chose to focus
on PLQY in solution. Complex 12 exhibited the highest
PLQY (24%), and complex 13 exhibited the lowest (6%).
Complex 10 displayed higher PLQY than complexes 9, 11, and 14 (14% for 10 compared to 11% for 9, 9% for 11, and
10% for 14). Complexes 9–14 also
exhibited extremely weak oxygen-sensitive phosphorescence in MeCN,
as has been observed for other complexes.28,29 Thus, we concluded that substitution on the wingtip and the cyclometallating
ring had little effect on PLQY. Similarly, while methyl substitution
on the ancillary ligand greatly enhanced PLQY, more electron-rich
methoxy and strongly accepting trifluoromethyl both decreased PLQY
in comparison to complex 9.

Because their PLQY
values in solution exhibited the most variation,
we chose to study the PLQY of emitters 12–14 when
dissolved in a variety of host matrices (Table 2 and Supporting Information). The PLQY values for Ir816 were much higher in solution
and in XTM014 than for complexes 12–14. Contrary
to what was observed in solution, complexes 12 and 14 exhibited similar PLQY values in each of the matrices.
Complex 13 was a much less efficient emitter in each
trial, perhaps largely because of the energy gap law. PLQY values
for each complex in 26DCZ(ppy) were highest overall and lowest in
poly(methyl methacrylate-co-butyl methacrylate) (PMMA).
These results indicate that the local environment in PMMA favors nonradiative
pathways, especially in comparison to 26DCZ(ppy).30 Thus, it was observed that even though PLQY in PMMA (and
solution) was low, judicious host selection could boost PLQY values.

Angle-Dependent Photoluminescence
The average orientation
of transition dipole moments in thin films of emitters embedded in
a host matrix is a useful and interesting aspect to analyze.32 In the past years, it became more clear that
orienting the transition dipole moments of the emitters horizontally,
in plane with the substrate, can improve the light outcoupling efficiency
of OLEDs and therefore their EQE.33 Several
factors can influence the orientation of the emitters, such as the
deposition technique,34 host material,35 particular processing conditions,36 and molecular shape of the emitter itself.37 We analyzed the orientation of the average transition
dipole moments of compounds 9, 10, and 11 in two different host matrices, poly(9-vinylcarbazole)
(PVK) and poly(4-butylphenyl-diphenyl-amine) (poly-TPD). After preparing
the solutions (9:1 host/guest ratio), we deposited them on quartz
substrates, and we measured the transition dipole moments of the emitters
from thin films. The experimental angular dependencies of the p-polarized
photoluminescence intensities were used as the input for optical simulations
using the software OrientExpress.38 The
angular emission profile of the vertical and horizontal radiating
dipoles is simulated based on the thickness and (anisotropic) refractive
indices of the layers and the substrate. Hereby, an even distribution
of the emitters across the emitting layer is assumed, and the intensities
of the contributing dipoles are added accordingly.

The relative
weights of the contributions of horizontal and vertical dipoles to
the emission profile are then obtained from the measured one by simple
linear regression. The comparison of the experimental data with the
optical simulations allows one to quantify the degree of the orientation
of the transition dipole moments of the emitters in the host. The
average orientation of the transition dipole moments can be represented
by Θ, the ratio of the horizontal component of the transition
dipole moments to the total transition dipole moments. For a fully
random distribution of transition dipole moments, Θ = 0.66.

As a reference, we use the homoleptic Ir(ppy)3, which
is randomly oriented in evaporated layers.39 As for 9, 10, and 11, we
mix the isotropic emitter in both PVK and poly-TPD (9:1 host/guest
ratio) for comparison.

When films have the same thickness and
the same host material,
PL angle-dependent graphs can be roughly interpreted by comparing
the PL at large (55°) angles with the PL at small angles (0°).

Horizontal dipoles emit more at small angles (as the dipole oscillating
in a plane emits preferentially in directions perpendicular to it),
while vertical dipoles emit more at high angles. Therefore, the layers
with higher PL at 55° have average transition dipole moments
less horizontally oriented. Figure 6 shows the PL angle dependency of the emitters analyzed
in PVK, both experimental measurements and simulated fit (used to
quantify the orientation). The transition dipole moments of Ir(ppy)3, the isotropic reference material, are the most vertically
oriented, followed by 10. 9 and 11 show the same behavior, and their transition dipole moments are
the most horizontally oriented. A similar behavior is observed for
the emitters in poly-TPD, apart from the fact that in poly-TPD, complex 10 has transition dipole moments slightly more vertically
oriented than Ir(ppy)3. Table 3 shows the orientation parameters quantified
by combining the experimental data with optical simulation. Here,
we can see that all the emitters perform better in poly-TPD rather
than in PVK (they have higher Θ), and that 9 and 11 are more favorably oriented compared to the reference isotropic
emitter and to 10. However, all the values for Θ
are lower than 0.66, which indicates a vertical orientation of the
average transition dipole moment.

The apparent
preferential vertical orientation of transition dipole
moments of Ir(ppy)3 in the polymer hosts is surprising:
for this homoleptic complex, one would expect fully random orientation
because of its almost isotropic shape. The preferential vertical orientation
of Ir(ppy)3 has also been reported for another unoriented,
solution-deposited host material.34 We
note that the preference for the vertical orientation is the largest
when using the PVK host material. Below, we briefly discuss a possible
contribution to the apparent vertical orientation of the iridium compounds
stemming purely from the optical anisotropy of the PVK host.

Solution-deposited layers of PVK have an unusual, positive uniaxial
anisotropy (ne > no)40 that may be rationalized
in
terms of a preferential horizontal orientation of the polymer backbone41 with the highly polarizable carbazole side groups
orienting such that the long axis of the carbazole moiety is perpendicular
to the main chain. Taking into account all possible orientations of
the main chain and the carbazole side groups, one then expects the
film to be most polarizable in the direction perpendicular to the
plane of the film, explaining why ne > no. For molecules in a dielectric medium, it
is well-known that the polarizability of the medium can couple with
the oscillating transition charge density on a dye molecule to produce
an effective transition dipole moment μeff that can
be larger than the transition dipole moment μbare of the bare molecule. The so-called empty cavity model42 predicts: 1  

The empty cavity
model has been found to give an accurate description
of the changes in the radiative rate constant for small metal organic
luminophores33 induced by the polarizability
of the environment. If we now take into consideration a uniaxial optically
anisotropic medium (no ≠ ne), then based on eq 1, one may expect an apparent preferential
orientation of the effective transition dipole moment of an isotropically
oriented dye in the direction corresponding to the largest value of
the refractive index. In a pragmatic approach, one predicts preferential
orientations of the effective transition dipole moment that deviate
from the isotropic value by about a percent by simply inserting values
for ne and no into 1. Assuming a slightly simpler relation
between the effective transition dipole moment and the refractive
index43 (μeff ∞ n), one predicts slightly larger deviations from the isotropic
values for the orientation, but the differences are still smaller
than 4%. In summary, it is conceivable that the positive optical anisotropy
of the PVK host contributes to the apparent vertical orientation of
the Ir(ppy)3 emitter, but on the basis of the bulk dielectric
constant, we cannot quantitatively account for the observed deviations.
This may indicate the importance of specific molecular interactions
between the emitter and the host.

Compared to the homoleptic
Ir(ppy)3 emitter with its
virtually isotropic shape, the heteroleptic emitters 9 and 11 show an inclination toward more horizontal preferential
orientation of transition dipole moments in both polymeric hosts investigated
(see Table 3). Yet,
on an absolute scale, the values of Θ obtained are indicative
of a largely random orientation of the transition dipole moment of
these luminophores.

Conclusions
Finding new, more efficient
emitters for OLEDs is an important
challenge in chemistry because lighting devices consume a large amount
of energy worldwide. Toward this end, emitting molecules must be rationally
designed to fit in to high-performance device configurations. Toward
the aim of a deeper understanding of the ramifications of emitter
functionalization, we synthesized a series of heteroleptic bis(2-arylimidazole)
iridum(III) picolinates with different steric and electronic modifications,
from simple alkyl substitution on the cyclometallating ring or the
imidazole wingtip group to electronic modification of the picolinate
ligand. The complexes were characterized by nuclear magnetic resonance
(NMR), UV–visible absorption spectroscopy, photoluminescence
spectroscopy, and mass spectrometry, and three complexes were characterized
by SC-XRD. Three of the complexes were blended in two different host
matrices, and the obtained thin films were characterized by photoluminescent
angle dependency to measure the orientation of their average transition
dipole moment. The other three complexes were used as dopants in host
matrices, and the PLQY of these films was measured. It was determined
that ligand substitution played a major role in the relative position
of molecular energy levels (and thus emission wavelength) and the
observed PLQY. Establishing the structure–property relationship
in various phosphorescent emitters for OLEDs is important, as better
design rules will come from a larger pool of known complexes. Further
studies into structure–property relationships in Ir(III) emitters
are currently underway.

Experimental Section
General Information
All commercially obtained reagents
were used as received. Unless otherwise noted, all reactions were
performed under an N2 atmosphere. Thin-layer chromatography
(TLC) was conducted with Sigma T-6145-precoated TLC silica gel 60
F254 aluminum sheets and/or visualized with UV and potassium
permanganate staining. Flash column chromatography was performed as
described by still using Silicycle P60, 40–63 μm (230–400
mesh).441H NMR spectra were
recorded on Bruker AVIII-HD (400 or 200 MHz), and they are reported
in ppm using solvent as an internal standard (CDCl3 at
7.26 ppm). Data are reported as follows: s = singlet, d = doublet,
t = triplet, q = quartet, p = pentet, m = multiplet, b = broad, ap
= apparent; coupling constant(s) in Hz; integration. UV–vis
spectra were measured with an LS-55 spectrometer. Cyclic voltammetry
was measured with a Bio-Logic S-200 potentiostat. Mass spectra were
recorded on a Bruker autoflex MALDI-TOF or ESI mass spectrometer.
2,4,6-Triisopropylaniline was prepared according to the literature
procedure.45 SC-XRD measurements were conducted
on a Bruker VENTURE SCXRD instrument. CCDC 1583689 (11), 1584183 (12), 1583690 (13) contain the
supplementary crystallographic data for this paper. These data can
be obtained free of charge from The Cambridge Crystallographic Data
Centre. For the analysis of the orientation of transition dipole moments,
three of the Ir complexes synthesized were mixed each with two different
host materials, PVK and poly(4-butylphenyl-diphenyl-amine) (poly-TPD).
The host and guest materials were blended in a 9:1 ratio in chlorobenzene
(0.5 wt %) and deposited on quartz substrates by spin-coating at 600
or 800 rpm, forming 18 to 33 nm thick films. The angle-dependent emission
of the emitters in the host/guest system was measured in thin films
by using a setup described previously.38,46 Both layer
preparation and angle-dependent measurements were performed in an
inert N2 atmosphere (H2O and O2 <
1 ppm) to avoid photochemical degradation and photoluminescence quenching
induced by combination of oxygen and UV light. To quantify the orientation
of transition dipole moments of the emitters, the experimental measurements
were combined with optical simulation by using the OrientExpress software,
described in detail in the Supporting Information of ref (38). 2,6-Bis(3-(9H-carbazol-9-yl)phenyl)pyridine (26DCzppy), 4,4′,4″-tris(carbazol-9-yl)triphenylamine,
and 1,3-bis[2-(4-tert-butylphenyl)-1,3,4-oxadiazo-5-yl]benzene (OXD-7)
were purchased from lumtec. PMMA and chlorobenzene were purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich.

The optical constants (refractive index, n, and extinction coefficient, k) of the
pure host materials, PVK and poly-TPD, were determined experimentally
by spectroscopic ellipsometry at various angles of incidence and transmission
intensity measurements at 0° (perpendicular incidence). Optical
constants for the host material also containing the molecular emitter
(10 wt %) were assumed to be the same as the pure host. Optical constants
were determined using WVASE 32 software from Woollam. Uniaxial optical
anisotropy was taken into consideration, and ordinary and extraordinary
optical constants were extracted from ellipsometry data of the pure
host polymers. These data were used as the input for the optical simulations
to quantify the orientation of transition dipole moments.

Photoluminescence
Characterization
Each complex (10 wt %) was mixed in different
host matrixes. The
films were deposited from 10 mg mL–1 solution of
complexes in chlorobenzene. Prior to deposition, all solutions were
filtered with a 0.2 μm pore size filter and spin-coated at 1500
rpm for 60 s in inert atmosphere onto cleaned quartz substrates. The
thin-film photoluminescence spectra and quantum yields were measured
in air with a Hamamatsu C9920-02 absolute PLQY measurement system.

A 1 L round-bottom
flask
equipped with a stirbar was charged with 750 mL MeOH and sparged vigorously
with N2. After 20 min, 2,6-diispropylaniline (20 mL, 18.8
g, 106 mmol) and glyoxal (14.4 mL, 106 mmol, 40% in H2O)
were added and stirred at rt. After 16 h, large yellow crystals were
observed. To this suspension, NH4Cl (5.79 g, 212 mmol)
was added, a reflux condenser was attached, and the solution was warmed
to reflux. Once the crystals had dissolved, formaldehyde (16 mL, 212
mmol, 37.5% in H2O) was added, and heating continued. After
1.5 h, 85% H3PO4 (25 mL) was added, and the
reaction was further refluxed and monitored by TLC. After 6 h, the
flask was cooled down to rt, and then to 0 °C, and pH was adjusted
to 9 with 15% KOH. The organic phase was extracted with Et2O (3 × 250 mL), washed with H2O (3 × 500 mL),
and concentrated on a rotary evaporator after drying with MgSO4. It was submitted to column chromatography using 650 mL SiO2 and gradient hexanes to 30% EtOAc/hexanes. The product spot
was concentrated to yield an off-white solid (12.4 g, 51% yield).
