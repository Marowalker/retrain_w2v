Heavy-metal
pollution poses severe threat to ecological systems
and presents a great challenge for global sustainability. Portable
point-of-care sensing platform for detection/monitoring of heavy-metal
pollution in the environment is urgently demanded. Herein, a highly
sensitive, robust, and low-cost microfluidic electrochemical carbon-based
sensor (μCS) for detection of trace heavy metals is presented.
The miniaturized μCS devices are based on a microfluidic paper
channel combined with a novel three-dimensional layout with working
and counter electrodes facing each other and analyte flowing along
the microfluidic channel between these two electrodes. Pristine graphite
foil free of any surface modifier is not only used as the electronically
conductive pad but also directly employed as the working electrode
for fabricating the μCS. The resulting simple and portable device
was applied in Cd2+ and Pb2+ detection using
square-wave anodic stripping voltammetry. Detection limits down to
1.2 μg/L for Cd2+ and 1.8 μg/L for Pb2+ can be achieved over the μCS. The μCS devices are also
found to be highly robust, and 10 repetitive measurements with a single
μCS device resulted to be highly reproducible.

Introduction
Heavy metals are widely
used in the manufacture of batteries, pigments,
alloys, electroplating, coating, and so forth.1,2 However,
mining, pouring, casting, processing, and inappropriate disposal of
heavy metals have made them hazardous pollutants to the environment.3−6 Their toxic and nonbiodegradable nature imposes severe risks to
human health.6−9 For example, increasing amounts of lead (Pb) in human body, as indicated
by blood Pb levels, can impair neurobehavioral development in children,
increase blood pressure, and cause kidney injury and anemia.2,5,9,10 Cadmium
(Cd) has been proved to be a carcinogenic agent and may cause lung
cancer, osteomalacia, and proteinuria, even at low doses.1,9,11,12 Conventional methods for heavy-metal detection are mainly based
on atomic adsorption spectroscopy, X-ray fluorescence, inductively
coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy, and inductively coupled
plasma mass spectroscopy.5,12−14 Nevertheless, these ponderous, sophisticated, and expensive instruments
are not suitable for fast and point-of-care analysis.5,13 Hence, researchers have been striving to develop simple, cost-effective,
and portable sensing devices for fast and point-of-care analysis of
heavy-metal pollution in the environment, especially in developing
countries and areas with insufficient infrastructures.

Numerous
detection platforms, including colorimetric, fluorescent,
and electrochemical methods, have already been adopted to fabricate
miniaturized portable devices for heavy-metal detections.15 Among them, the electrochemical method has attracted
intensive attention due to its capability for achieving better quantitative
results, more rapid analysis, and higher sensitivity.13,15,16 However, for the electrochemical
detection of even trace amounts of heavy metals, it is usually mandatory
to modify the surface of the working electrode with active electrocatalysts
(receptors), which are supposed to have high collection capacity of
target metal ions. This surface modification is especially of importance
for the miniaturized devices because of the small amount of analyte
(typically less than 100 μL) to be used for the analysis. Following
this line of reasoning, a wide range of organic and inorganic materials
have been used to modify the working electrode for the electrochemical
detection of trace heavy metals. In early times, hanging mercury drop
electrodes and electrodes modified with a mercury film were commonly
used for heavy-metal detection because of the capability of mercury
to form amalgam with heavy-metal ions, which results in its high sensitivity
and good reproducibility.15,17−19 However, the well-known toxicity of mercury limits the development
of mercury electrode sensor.20 Later on,
bismuth has been introduced as an alternative surface modifier due
to its unique behavior to form multicomponent Bi alloys with numerous
heavy metals and less toxicity compared to mercury.21−27 Detection by bismuth-modified electrodes is usually carried out
by simultaneous electroreduction of Bi ions and heavy-metal ions onto
carbon-based solid electrodes (e.g., glassy carbon,28−30 carbon nanofibers
(CNFs)/nanotubes,21,28,31−33 graphite,7,34−36 graphene,13,37,38 and carbon paste/ink23,25,39,40). The prereduced Bi could promote the deposition
of heavy-metal ions from analytes by forming “fuse alloys”,
which are analogous to the amalgam mercury forms.21,26,27 However, bismuth-modified electrode usually
needs to be activated using a tedious pretreatment to improve the
sensing reproducibility and is not applicable for some in situ and
online trace metal measurements in natural or bioenvironment because
it introduces Bi ions additionally.9,41 Besides, Bi
ions are easy to hydrolyze to form insoluble compound in aqueous solution.21,42 For this reason, pH of the sample media should be controlled below
5 to avoid hydrolysis of Bi ions, which makes this method unpractical
for biological and clinical analyses.9,21 In recent
years, a great variety of innovative nanomaterials, such as metal
(Au, Ag, Pd) nanoparticles,5,43,44 carbonaceous materials (carbon nanotubes, graphene, carbon spheres),20,35,37 and biological materials (DNA,
protein/enzyme),45,46 have been tested as surface modifier
for electrochemical detection of heavy-metal ions. Considering the
tedious synthesis procedure and relatively high cost of these materials,
using these innovative nanomaterials could be a big burden in mass
production of electrochemical sensors and prohibit cost effectiveness.

Carbon-based materials, including bare glassy carbon electrode
(GCE), in principle can also be directly used for heavy-metal detection.
Hashemi et al. also demonstrated that surface modifier-free carbon-fiber
microelectrode in combination with an high-performance liquid chromatography
unit can be employed for copper-ion detection.47,48 In the current work, we are intending to directly use the inexpensive
graphite foil without any surface modifier for electrochemical detection
of heavy-metal ions in water, and graphite foils were chosen because
of their excellence in both chemical stability and electrical conductivity.
However, the challenge lies in two aspects: (1) how to achieve low
limit of detection (LOD) (e.g., drinking-water standards established
by World Health Organization (WHO) or United States Environmental
Protection Agency (US-EPA)) by directly using graphite foils without
any surface modifier and (2) how to transfer the sensing performance
to a miniaturized device. Herein, these challenges are overcome by
integrating a microfluidic paper channel into the miniaturized carbon-based
sensor, where the pristine graphite foils were used as working, pseudoreference,
and counter electrodes. The microfluidic channel continuously and
efficiently delivers the aqueous analyte to the detection sites to
enable a shortening of the overall current response time. Moreover,
the μCS possesses a novel three-dimensional (3D) structure with
working and reference electrodes directly facing each other but separated
by the microfluidic paper channel, as shown schematically in Figure 1. This configuration
brings the working electrode in close proximity to the counter electrode,
and the resulting more homogeneous and efficient electric field is
supposed to facilitate the reductive deposition of metal ion on the
graphite-foil working electrode.49 The
sensing performance of the μCS built solely from paper and graphite
foil as benign and inexpensive materials is evaluated by detecting
heavy-metal Cd2+ and Pb2+, which are common
pollutants in the environment. It is found that impressive low detection
limits of 1.2 μg/L for Cd2+ and 1.8 μg/L for
Pb2+ can be achieved on the μCS. The μCS also
exhibits stable sensing performance up to 10 repetitive measurements,
demonstrating the unprecedented robustness of a sensing device for
heavy-metal detections. We also successfully demonstrate that even
for a miniaturized device, a proper design in the device configuration
can completely eliminate the necessity to modify the working electrode
by using additional surface modifier, such as mercury or bismuth.
We believe these findings would have significant implications in developing
other fast and cost-effective detection platforms, such as clinical
diagnosis and security inspection.

on paper (light blue) and
graphite foil (black). The dimensions are detailed in Figure S1.

Results and Discussion
Optimization of Square-Wave Voltammetry Parameters
To evaluate the sensing performance of the as-prepared μCS
devices for heavy-metal detections, square-wave anodic stripping voltammetry
(SWASV) measurements, which is well-known for its high sensitivity,
were carried out for detections of Cd2+ and Pb2+. To realize a sensitive measurement, experimental parameters, including
electrodeposition potential, deposition time, and electrolyte pH,
which are considered as the most important influential factors in
SWASV, were optimized, and the results are shown in Figure 2. The effect of electrodeposition
potential was investigated by studying the anodic stripping peak current
of 100 μg/L Cd2+ and 100 μg/L Pb2+ in 0.1 M acetate buffer solution (pH = 4.6) while varying the electrode
potentials (Figure 2a). First, it can be observed that Cd2+ requires a more
negative potential (−1.1 V) to be deposited on the graphite-foil
electrode than Pb2+ (−0.9 V), which is not surprising
considering their difference in standard reduction potentials. In
principle, lower deposition potential could be more efficient to promote
the reductive deposition of metal ions on the working electrodes (WEs).
Interestingly, the peak currents for both metals exhibit a volcano
dependence on the applied potentials with the maximum current obtained
at potentials of −1.2 and −1.1 V for Cd2+ and Pb2+, respectively, which were later chosen as the
deposition potentials for SWASV measurements. The decrease of the
peak current at relatively lower deposition potential is caused by
the competing hydrogen evolution reaction (H+ + e– → H2),50 where hydrogen
gas bubbles can be clearly observed on the surface of the WE at low
deposition potential. The effect of deposition time was investigated
by varying the deposition time in the range of 1–10 min for
Cd2+ and 1–15 min for Pb2+ (Figure 2b). Although longer
deposition time always leads to higher current intensity, it could
lower the upper range of heavy-metal detection due to the fast surface
saturation in higher ion concentration. Herein, the deposition time
was fixed at 1 and 3 min for detecting Cd2+ and Pb2+, respectively, as the trade-off between fast analysis and
significant current response. A shorter deposition time was chosen
for Cd2+ simply because a good linear calibration plot
has already been obtained with a shorter time. As shown in Figure 2b, the proportional
increase in the peak current with increasing the deposition time from
7 to 10 min indicates that the electrode surface is still far from
being saturated. It is therefore possible to further improve the detection
sensitivity by increasing the deposition time. The effect of electrolyte
pH was studied by varying the pH values of acetate buffer solution
from 3.0 to 6.0 (Figure 2c). It turns out that the square-wave stripping peak current was
increasing rapidly with the increase of the pH values from 3.0 to
4.6, whereas further increasing pH to 6.0 has imposed minor influence
on the peak currents for Cd2+ and Pb2+ detection.
In contrast, it is well documented that the stripping current on Bi-modified
electrode would decrease with increasing pH values.50,51 These results demonstrate that the detection performance of the
μCS would be compromised for the sample with low pH values (≤4.0),
which is also the case for the modified electrodes.50−53 Therefore, for analyte with low
pH values (e.g., acidified water samples with pH < 2), we cannot
expect the modifier-free μCS to exhibit superior sensing performance
with respect to the conventional modified electrodes. However, for
the samples with relatively high pH values, the μCS does show
better tolerance on the pH values of the water samples. As the maximum
stripping current can be obtained at pH = 4.6, the acetate buffer
solution with pH 4.6 was used in subsequent experiments.

Figure 2 Effect of deposition
time (a), deposition potential (b), and electrolyte
pH (c) on Cd2+ and Pb2+ detection. The concentration
of both Cd2+ and Pb2+ is 100 μg/L.

As the sensing performance of
a microfluidic device is also sensitive
to the flow rate of an analyte to the detection sites, herein we also
made attempts to evaluate the average flow rate of analytes within
the paper channel. A typical capillary flow follows the Lucas–Washburn
equation, which predicts that the flow rate decreases with increasing
time. It has been experimentally demonstrated that the capillary flow
behavior would significantly deviate from the Lucas–Washburn
equation in the presence of an absorbent pad, and in this case, the
capillary flow is sustained over time (quasi-stationary flow with
time) because the liquid in the microfluidic channel would encounter
a continuous increase in unwetted pore volume as it advanced in the
porous absorbent pad. The constant cross section assumed by the Lucas–Washburn
equation does not apply anymore.54 Similarly,
in the current work, due to the presence of an absorbent pad at the
end of the paper channel, we found that the stripping peak current
was rather constant over a 15 min measurement time. This implies that
the flow rate of analyte within the paper channel is not diminishing
significantly over time and thus allows us to estimate the average
flow rate of analyte by quantifying the mass (volume) of solution
within the sampling sponge before and after the measurement over 15
min. The average flow rate or consumption rate of an aqueous analyte
is estimated to be 130 μL/min. The sampling volumes for a single
detection are ca. 130 and 390 μL for Cd2+ and Pb2+, respectively, which appear to be sufficient to get well-resolved
stripping signals.

Individual Detection of Cd2+ and
Pb2+
After optimizing the square-wave voltammetry
parameters, the μCS
was applied in individual detection of Cd2+ and Pb2+ in acetate buffer solution. Typical square-wave voltammograms
in the presence of Cd2+ and Pb2+ with different
concentrations are displayed in Figure 3. Well-defined anodic stripping peaks centering at
−0.78 and −0.52 V (vs carbon pseudoreference electrode)
were obtained for Cd2+ and Pb2+, respectively.
The peak currents of both Cd2+ and Pb2+ increase
linearly with concentration from 5 to 100 μg/L (Figure 3b,d). However, peak broadening
occurs at analyte concentration below 10 μg/L for both Cd2+ and Pb2+, which might stem from the heterogeneity
of surface-active sites on the surface of graphite foils and associated
varied interactions with the deposited metal particles. This might
also lead to the loss of linear response of SWASV signals at lower
analyte concentrations (<5 μg/L) by using the μCS.
For instance, it is difficult for us to discriminate the analytes
with Cd2+ concentrations between 1 and 2 ppb by comparing
their SWASV signals, although their stripping peaks are still well
resolved. Attempts were also made to study the upper limit of the
linear range for both metals. As shown in Figure S2, the linear range for Cd2+ can be extended up
to at least 500 μg/L. In contrast, we found that although the
peak current response for Pb2+ would still get increased
with the concentration, however, it deviates from the linear calibration
plot obtained at the concentration range of 5–100 μg/L,
which would stem from saturation of surface sites for metal ions with
higher concentrations. The calibration plots and correlation coefficients
are shown in Figure 3b,d (x: concentration/μg/L, y: current/μA). The limits of detection for Cd2+ and
Pb2+ are 1.2 and 1.8 μg/L based on 3σ method
(detailed in the Supporting Information), respectively, which are below the allowable limits in drinking
water proposed by US-EPA (Cd: 5 μg/L, Pb: 15 μg/L) and
WHO (Cd: 3 μg/L, Pb: 10 μg/L).55,56 Specifically, in the case of Cd2+ detection, the μCS
device is capable of not only quantifying Cd2+ in water
samples with ion concentration above the US-EPA allowable limits (5
μg/L) but also raising an alert for the water sample that contains
ions with concentration below the allowable limit. Moreover, the impressive
low detection limits and wide linear detection range achieved by using
the μCS for both analytes also indicate that the potential selective
absorption of Cd2+ or Pb2+ by the sensor components,
that is, paper, graphite foil, or sampling sponge, plays a minor role
in the electrochemical sensing on the μCS, at least for analytes
with concentration above the lower limit of linear detection range.
This is consistent with the finding reported by Pickering that the
presence of competing electrolyte could significantly reduce the absorption/uptake
of heavy-metal ions (e.g., Pb2+, Cd2+) by filter
paper.57 It is proposed that absorption
of metal ions (Pb2+, Cd2+, etc.) by filter paper
may be attributed to an ion-exchange process, whereas abundant cations
in the electrolyte would suppress this exchange process due to the
preferential retention of cations in the electrolyte.57 The capability and performance of μCS are also compared
to those of some modified electrodes, screen-printing electrodes (SPEs),
and miniaturized sensors in recent literatures in Table 1. Apart from using miniaturized
sensors, electrochemical sensing measurement can also be conducted
using the bulk electrochemical cell configuration, where a surface-modified
glassy carbon electrode, as the WE, is placed in excess amount of
electrolyte with analyte (e.g., 100 mL). The bulk electrochemical
cell configuration usually gives lower detection limit compared to
that of miniaturized sensors because of the significantly much larger
amount of analyte being used during the sensing process. It can be
seen that the μCS devices exhibits almost comparable sensing
performance to some state-of-the-art surface-modified electrodes in
bulk electrochemical cell configuration and is also among the best
miniaturized on-chip sensing devices in terms of detection limit and
sensitivity. To be noted, for practical application, usually an analyte
solution with large collection volume (e.g., 100 mL) is provided,
and the small analyte volume required by using these μCS devices
for a single analysis would enable strict replicate analysis and allow
to achieve even lower detection limit by concentrating the analyte
solution.

c Detection limit in the simultaneous
detection of Cd2+ and Pb2+.

Compared to these sensing platforms,
where relatively expensive
(Pd, Ag, CNF) or other heavy-metal (Bi/Bi2O3) surface modifiers have to be used, in the current work, only inexpensive
and environmental friendly materials (cellulose paper, graphite foil)
were used to fabricate the μCS devices. The low cost and environmental
friendly nature make these μCS devices entirely disposable without
causing additional pollution to the environment, thus holding great
application prospect in future point-of-care analysis of heavy-metal
ions.

Simultaneous Detection of Cd2+ and Pb2+
The performance of the μCS for simultaneous detection
of Cd2+ and Pb2+ was also evaluated. The measurements
were carried out in 0.1 M acetate buffer solution (pH = 4.6) containing
Cd2+ and Pb2+ by first holding the deposition
potential at −1.2 V and then square-wave anodic stripping.
The reductive deposition time is fixed at 3 min for simultaneous detection
of both metals, to ensure that SWASV signal for Pb is strong enough
for quantification analysis. As shown in Figure 4a, stripping peaks for Cd and Pb slightly
overlap with each other and detection limits for both ions are worse
than their corresponding individual detection. A similar peak intensity
is obtained for Pb by comparing with the individual Pb detection.
However, the peak intensity of Cd decreased in comparison with the
individual analysis. This phenomenon may arise from the competitive
adsorption of Cd2+ and Pb2+ on the surface of
graphite foil, which leads to a reduction in the stripping peak intensity
of Cd. Due to the overlap between these two stripping peaks, peak
deconvolution was applied by using a Gaussian line shape, in a hope
to obtain the “real” current contributed from individual
metal ion. We found that calibration plots obtained on the basis of
apparent or deconvoluted peak current gave quite comparable slopes
(0.11 for Pb and 0.05 for Cd), and only minor differences in interception
(<0.1 μA for both metals) can be observed. Therefore, in
principle, both apparent and deconvoluted peak currents can be used
to quantify the heavy-metal concentration, and for simplicity, we
chose to use the apparent peak current later on. The slope changes
in calibration plots, shown in Figure 4b, indicate that there are some interactions between
Cd2+ and Pb2+ deposition processes. Nevertheless,
these two ions could still be simultaneously detected within the linear
range of 20–100 μg/L using μCS devices, with the
detection limit of 6 μg/L for both metals. It should be noted
that the μCS device actually still holds the potential to exhibit
further improved sensing sensitivity for simultaneous detection by
simply increasing the deposition time, given that recommended deposition
time is as long as 10 min for some commercially available screen-printed
electrodes for heavy-metal detection.68

Detection of Cd2+ and Pb2+ in Commercial
Mineral Water
To test the sensing performance of these μCS
devices under more complex conditions, attempts herein were made to
use commercial mineral water, which contains Na+ (109 mg/L),
K+ (13.3 mg/L), Mg2+ (28.6 mg/L), Ca2+ (175 mg/L), Cl– (128 mg/L), sulfate (31 mg/L),
and bicarbonate (706 mg/L) according to its specification, as a practical
sample for the detection of Cd2+ and Pb2+. Prior
to the measurement, bottled mineral water was used to prepare acetate
buffer solution (0.1 M, pH = 4.6). It can be seen that no stripping
peak for either Cd2+ or Pb2+ can be detected
for the pristine mineral water sample (Figure S3). However, clear stripping peaks can be seen on the mineral
water samples with intentionally added Cd2+ or Pb2+. The peak intensities were increased proportionally by increasing
the concentration of both metal ions from 10 to 50 μg/L, and
the calculated concentrations using the calibration plots (Figure 3b,d) are consistent
with their nominal values (i.e., 10 or 50 μg/L), as listed in Table 2. On the basis of
these results, we can draw two conclusions: (1) there is no or little
amount (below the limit of detection) of these heavy metals in this
commercial mineral water and (2) the presence of various mineral ions
in the commercial mineral water imposes little effect on the sensing
performance of the μCS, again demonstrating the great prospect
of the μCS to be used in practical sample analysis.

Influence of Interfering Ions on Cd2+ and Pb2+ Detection
To test the selectivity behavior of μCS
toward Cd2+ and Pb2+ detection, Ba2+, Mn2+, Zn2+, Fe2+, Co2+, Ni2+, Fe3+, and Cu2+ were chosen
as interfering ions. The standard reduction potentials of these ions
are shown in Table 3. Acetate buffer (pH = 4.6) containing 100 μg/L Cd2+ or Pb2+ together with 5 mg/L interfering ions was tested
using the μCS. In principle, ions with higher reduction potential
could affect the detection of ions with lower reduction potential.
For example, the existence of Co2+, Ni2+, Fe3+, and Cu2+ may have influence on the electroreduction
process of Cd2+. To investigate the influence of interfering
ions on Cd2+ detection using μCS, the eight interfering
ions were divided into four groups: (1) Ba2+, Mn2+, Zn2+, and Fe2+, which have lower reduction
potential than Cd2+; (2) Co2+ and Ni2+, which have similar reduction potentials; (3) Fe3+; and
(4) Cu2+. Figure 5a shows the influence of interfering ions on Cd2+ detection, which clearly shows that Ba2+, Mn2+, Zn2+, Fe2+, Co2+, Ni2+, and Fe3+ do not have much influence on Cd2+ detection, even though their concentration is 50-fold higher than
that of Cd2+. The impact of Cu2+ on Cd2+ detection may be due to its oxidation property. For real applications,
it thus becomes necessary to choose the appropriate calibration plot
according to the absence/presence of the stripping peak characteristic
of the interfering ion as Cu2+. Similar results could be
obtained on Pd2+ detection against interfering ions, as
shown in Figure 5b.

of interfering ions on Cd2+ (a) and Pb2+ (b)
detection. The concentration of both Cd2+ and Pb2+ was 100 μg/L. The concentration of each
interfering ions was controlled at 5 mg/L.

Influence of 3D Configuration and Paper Channel
To
study the influence of the newly introduced 3D sandwich configuration,
a sensor with a two-dimensional (2D) configuration was prepared. Similar
to the design of some commercial screen-printed electrochemical sensors,
three electrodes are parallel to each other and lie in the same horizontal
plane, whereas the microfluidic channel is placed across the three
electrodes (as illustrated in Figure S4). However, in contrast to the 3D configuration, the 2D one always
lead to rather small current signal and can hardly be used to detect
any trace amount of heavy metals (Figure S4). The poor performance of the 2D-structured μCS would originate
from the small amount of analyte solution being used for the analysis
and the relatively long distance between electrodes, which would cause
significant resistance between WE and pseudoreference electrode (RE)
(solution resistance) and the inefficient electric field between the
WE and counter electrode (CE) for metal-ion migration and deposition.
This drawback seems to be overcome by the 3D configuration, where
the WE and CE face each other and the electrolyte is along the microfluidic
channel between these two electrodes.

We also made attempts
to study the exact role of the paper channel in the μCS device.
To achieve this, a drop of analyte (200 μL) was added to the
gap between the working electrode and reference electrode. This droplet
stays well between these two electrodes because of the large surface
tension of water on the graphite foil. However, detection of 100 μg/L
Cd2+ over this stagnant analyte design sensor gives weak
stripping peak intensity (4 μA), which is much lower than the
value obtained in microfluidic configuration (Figure S5). After introducing the paper channel into the sensor,
which changes the stagnant analyte into fluidic one, the square-wave
voltammetry (SWV) signal increased from 4.0 to 11.5 μA, as shown
in Figure S5. Therefore, besides the 3D
structure, the paper channel is another key point in the sensor design,
which could efficiently facilitate the mass transfer of analyte to
detection sites.

Stability and Reproducibility of the μCS
The
reusability is a highly desirable feature for a sensing device, which
might result in significant cost and waste reduction during the field
analysis. For this reason, the electrochemical stability/reusability
of the μCS was studied by subjecting a single μCS device
to 10 repetitive SWASV measurements for detecting Cd2+ and
Pb2+ with concentrations of 50 and 100 μg/L, and
the current response is plotted against the cycle number, as shown
in Figure 6. Three
sensors are studied in each stability test. It can be seen that the
anodic stripping current shows negligible drop after 10 times repetitive
measurements regardless of the type/concentration of metal ions, demonstrating
the great robustness of these μCS devices for heavy-metal detections.
Specifically, the signal drops by 6 and 9% for 50 and 100 μg/L
Cd detection, respectively. The signal drops by 6 and 13% for 50 and
100 μg/L Pb detection, respectively. After 10 repetitive measurements,
the stripping current would gradually decrease by further increasing
the cycle numbers, which stems from the depletion of the analyte within
the sampling sponge. Considering that for practical application, it
is less likely to frequently reuse these portable devices due to their
low cost and possible cross-contamination from different samples,
and no further attempt was made to increase the cycle number by refilling
the sampling sponge. In addition to the superior stability of a single
device, the good reproducibility of the μCS has already been
reflected by the small relative standard deviation (<5%) over at
least four independent measurements (Figure 3). Attempt was also made to investigate the
electrochemical sensing capability of a Bi-modified electrode (denoted
as Bi-WE, WE modified with a mixture ink of Bi2O3 powder and carbon black). First, we investigated the effect of loading
amount of Bi2O3 within the electrocatalysts
on the electrochemical sensing performance by varying the loading
from 2 to 50 wt % and found that the highest stripping peak current
can be obtained at the loading around 25 wt %, which was later used
for further investigation. Surprisingly, it was found that the current
response differs significantly from one electrode to another and is
highly sensitive to the exposure time of the Bi-WE in air (Figure S7). First, it can be seen from Figure 6c that the stripping
peak current on fresh Bi-WE is actually ca. 25% higher than that on
the modifier-free μCS, demonstrating that in principle Bi-modified
electrode could exhibit higher sensitivity for Cd detection. Second,
the SWASV signal decreases by 43% relative to its initial value after
exposing the Bi-WE to air for only 5 min, and it is further decreased
by over 67% when the air exposure time is increased to 30 min. Although
the deactivation mechanism of the Bi-WE is still not fully understood,
it can be seen that the ill-defined initial status of the Bi-WE would
lead to scattered current response in electrochemical sensing measurement.
In contrast, the sensing performance is rather consistent over different
graphite-foil WEs free from any surface modifiers (Figure 6c). We believe that these results
echo the importance of elimination of surface modifier in developing
high-performing sensing platform with superior stability and reproducibility.

time (c).

Structural Analysis of
the Graphite Foil
To probe the
possible structural change of the graphite foil, Raman spectra were
captured on the graphite foils before and after the electrochemical
measurements. As shown in Figure 7, three characteristic peaks at 1350, 1580, and 2716
cm can be clearly resolved, which refer to disordered carbon structure
(D-band), graphite structure (G-band), and second-order double-resonant
scattering in graphite (G′-band), respectively. The identical
Raman spectra recorded on these two samples indicate that graphite
foil is rather robust during the electrochemistry measurement. Specifically,
the intensity ratio of D-band to G-band (ID/IR), which is usually taken as an indicator
of the graphitization degree for a carbon sample, is also comparable
(0.04) on the graphite foils with and without experiencing the electrochemical
measurements. These results confirm that the graphite foil has a high
graphitization degree and is chemically stable during the electrochemistry
measurement, which could rationalize the aforementioned well-reproducible
performance of the μCS device in the repetitive heavy-metal
sensing.

Figure 7 Raman spectrum for graphite foil before and after electrochemical
measurements.

We have demonstrated
that the modifier-free graphite foil is capable
of detecting heavy metals with high sensitivity, low detection limit,
and wide linear calibration region. However, it is still not well
understood why the inherently less active pristine carbon, that is,
graphite foil, could provide sufficient sites for the preconcentration
of metal ions. To explore the nature of active sites for electrodeposition
of metal ions on the graphite foil, we conducted scanning electron
microscopy (SEM) analysis on the graphite foils before and after electrodeposition
of Cd2+. As shown in Figure 8a, first, it can be seen that the surface of graphite
foils consists of interconnected flakes. After electrodeposition of
Cd2+, sphere-like particles (Cd or CdO) can be clearly
seen on the surface of graphite flakes (Figure 8b). Interestingly, it can be found that the
majority of the particles are selectively located at the edge position
of the graphite flakes, as illustrated by the marked squares in Figure 8b. These results
demonstrate that the edge surface positions of graphite flakes, where
the carbon atoms have lower coordination number, could be more active
to catalyze the electrodeposition of metal ions and provide the basis
for graphite foils to be directly used as WE for heavy-metal detection.
This phenomenon is actually not surprising, considering that it has
been well documented that electrochemical reaction at graphite edge
sites is preferential as the kinetics of bond formation at basal plane
sites is much slower than that at edge/defect sites.70 Nevertheless, as shown previously, the properly designed
sensor configuration is also a necessity for achieving high sensing
performance of these μCS devices.

of pristine graphite foil (a) and graphite
foil after electroreductive deposition of Cd2+ (b). The
square areas which are magnified in (b-1), (b-2), (b-3), and (b-4)
indicate that the electrodeposited Cd species are selectively located
at the edge positions of graphite flakes.

Conclusions
A heavy-metal electrochemical sensor assembled
using graphite foil
and paper was developed, which is capable of detecting heavy-metal
ions (Cd2+ and Pb2+) with wide linear range
and low LODs. The sensor is modifier free, less expensive, reusable,
and easy to fabricate, which would benefit from the combined microfluidic
configuration and novel 3D electrode layout. We also disclose that
the graphite foil comprising graphite flakes with abundant edge sites
could favor the metal deposition, thus providing a simple block material
to be used in electrochemical sensors. This easy-handling method could
provide some new ideas for other portable electroanalytical/sensing
systems.

Experimental Section
Materials and Chemicals
Cadmium
chloride (Sigma-Aldrich),
lead nitrate (Sigma-Aldrich), sodium acetate (Sigma-Aldrich), acetate
acid glacial (VWR), and ethanol (VWR) were all analytical-grade regents
and used as received. Graphite foil was purchased from Sigraflex.
Filter paper (pore size: 12–15 μm; thickness: 305 μm)
was purchased from VWR. All of the solutions were prepared using double-distilled
water.

Device Fabrication
Three-electrode configuration was
employed to construct the sensing devices. A piece of graphite foil
with thickness of 0.5 mm was first cleaned by ethanol and deionized
water under ultrasonication (300 W), followed by being cut into certain
shapes as working electrode (WE), counter electrode (CE), and pseudoreference
electrode (RE). Cleaning protocols for all of the other components,
that is, poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) substrate and sampling sponge,
were also critically applied using ethanol and deionized water under
ultrasonication before fabricating each μCS device to prevent
any contaminations. The design and dimensions are detailed in Figure S1. A piece of microfluidic paper was
sandwiched between the CE and WE, whereas the RE will be placed adjacent
to the RE to reduce the ohmic resistance. To complete the device,
the electrodes were taped onto a PMMA substrate for easy operation,
as shown in Figure 1. A piece of sponge, placed on one end of the paper channel, was
used as analyte reservoir, which contains 2 mL (initial volume) of
analyte solution and can constantly feed the analyte solution in 15
min. During the measurement, a glass vial was used to cover the sampling
sponge to prevent the solvent evaporation or concentration change
of an analyte. An absorbent pad cut in pieces is located at the other
end of the paper channel. The function of the absorbent pad is to
wick the fluid through the paper channel, create a quasi-steady flow
of analyte within the paper channel, and accumulate the amount of
analyte flowing through the detection sites. For preparation of the
Bi-modified WE, the catalyst suspension ink was first prepared by
dispersing 5 mg of Bi2O3 and 15 mg of carbon
black (Vulcan XC-72) together with 0.5 mL of 20 wt % Nafion in 1.5
mL of ethanol solution. The modified electrode was then prepared by
applying 5 μL of the above ink solution onto graphite foils,
covering an area of 0.5 × 0.5 mm2, which is comparable
to the effective surface area of WE in a modifier-free μCS device
(as detailed in the Supporting Information). The function of carbon black is to better disperse the Bi species
and also improve the electrical conductivity within the catalyst layer.

Electrochemical Measurements
Electrochemical measurements
were carried out on PARSTAT Multichannel-1000 (AMETEK) controlled
by the VersaStudio software. The SWASV measurements were conducted
at room temperature, and no deaeration was performed to the supporting
electrolyte (0.1 M acetate buffer solution). Heavy-metal concentrations
were evaluated using square-wave anodic stripping voltammetry (SWASV).
The SWASV experiments comprise an electrochemical deposition step
and a square-wave anodic stripping voltammetry scan. The SWASV was
performed under the following conditions: pulse height, 25 mV; step
height, 10 mV; frequency, 25 Hz. The calibration plots were generated
by conducting four independent measurements using four μCS devices.
On each device, the measurements were conducted with one standard
solution after the other, starting from the lowest to highest concentration.
In total, four sets of data were obtained, which are later used to
generate the error bars (defined as the relative standard deviation)
for each concentration.

Structural Analysis
Raman spectra
were recorded with
a Bruker Senterra Raman microscope spectrometer with 532 nm excitation
(laser power: 0.5 mW) and a 3 cm–1 resolution and
were captured from three different points for each sample. The morphology
of graphite foils was investigated using a scanning electron microscope
(Philips XL30 FEG) operated at an accelerating voltage of 30 kV.
