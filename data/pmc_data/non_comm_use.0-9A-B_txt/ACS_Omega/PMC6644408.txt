Azide–alkyne
“click” cyclization was used
to prepare a series of polymerizable acetoacetate monomers containing
a 1,2,3-trizolium ionic liquid group. The monomers were subsequently
polymerized using base-catalyzed Michael addition chemistry, producing
a series of covalently crosslinked 1,2,3-triazolium poly(ionic liquid)
(TPIL) networks. Structure–activity relationships were conducted
to gauge how synthetic variables, such as counteranion ([Br], [NO3], [BF4], [OTf], and [NTf2]), and crosslink
density (acrylate/acetoacetate ratio) effected thermal, mechanical,
and conductive properties. TPIL networks were found to exhibit ionic
conductivities in the range of 10–6–10–9 S/cm (30 °C, 30% relative humidity), as determined
from dielectric relaxation spectroscopy, despite their highly crosslinked
nature. Temperature-dependent conductivities demonstrate a dependence
on polymer glass transition, with free-ion concentrations impacted
by various ions’ Lewis acidity/basicity and ion mobilities
impacted by freely mobile anion size.

Introduction
Poly(ionic liquid)s
(PILs) remain a fascinating and important class
of polyelectrolytes, combining the unique properties of ionic liquids
(ILs) (high thermal and electrochemical stability, variable solubility,
viscosity, and ionic conductivity) with the tunable functionality
and mechanical stability of various macromolecular architectures.1−4 The thermal, mechanical, and conductive properties of PILs are primarily
varied by changing the chemical structure of the cation (ammonium,
phosphonium, imidazolium), anion (halides, inorganic fluorides, perfluoronated
sulfonimides), or both. As a result of their synthetic versatility,
PILs have been targeted for a number of important modern-day applications,
examples of which include actuators,5 batteries,6,7 fuel cells,8,9 and separation membranes.10−13 PILs have been generally prepared through the polymerization monomers
containing ILs, the postpolymerization quaternization of neutral polymers
or quaternization resulting from step-growth polymerization of neutral
monomers.

Contributions from our laboratories to the field of
PILs have centered
on the preparation of covalently crosslinked polyester networks following
either a thiol–ene photopolymerization14 or a base-catalyzed Michael addition polymerization strategy.15−19 Michael addition reactions are extremely useful for forming new
carbon–carbon bonds and readily occur under base-catalyzed
conditions between a Michael donor (an acetoacetate) and an α,β-unsaturated
carbonyl compound, such as an diacrylate ester (the Michael acceptor).15,16 Upon deprotonation of an acetoacetate, the resulting enolate anion
undergoes addition to an acrylate, resulting in a new carbon–carbon
bond after neutralization. Since each acetoacetate contains two acidic
protons, an additional Michael addition will occur in the presence
of excess diacrylate, resulting in covalent crosslinking. The degree
of crosslinking (and thus the thermal and mechanical properties of
the network) can be easily controlled through the manipulation of
the acrylate/acetoacetate ratio.16 Previous
work from our research group has demonstrated the versatility of the
Michael addition polymerization as a method for the preparation of
imidazolium17,18 and 1,2,4-triazolium PIL networks.19 Variations in network architecture (crosslink
density, counteranion, cation) have led to a library of PILs that
display a wide range of thermal and mechanical properties.

Although
the majority of the PIL literature has focused on ammonium,
phosphonium, and imidazolium polycations (with mobile counteranions),
1,2,3-triazolium-based poly(ionic liquid)s (TPILs) have become more
prominent due to the development of the copper(I)-catalyzed azide–alkyne
“click” cycloaddition reaction.20,21 Drockenmuller et al. have pioneered efforts in the synthesis of
a variety of TPILs, several approaches of which have been recently
reviewed.22 Such TPIL synthetic efforts
have ranged from the direct step-growth polyaddition of azides and
alkynes to the chain-growth polymerization of 1,2,3-triazolium-containing
(meth)acrylic monomers. Within their library of TPILs, several covalently
crosslinked networks were prepared and evaluated for various applications.
For example, an epoxy-functionalized IL monomer was reacted with a
poly(propylene glycol)-based diamine, providing TPIL epoxy–amine
networks with relatively high anhydrous ionic conductivities (∼10–7 S/cm at 30 °C).23 In another example, covalently crosslinked polyether-based TPIL
membranes with conductivities of up to 10–6 S/cm
at 30 °C under anhydrous conditions and CO2 permeability
values of 59–110 barrer with CO2/N2 selectivities
of 25–48 were also synthesized.24 TPIL vitrimer networks utilizing thermally reversible C–N
bond transalkylation exchanges have also been reported and were found
to exhibit ionic conductivities up to 10–8 S/cm
(30 °C, anhydrous) as well as reshaping and recycling behavior.25,26

TPIL polyester networks, which contained an asymmetrically
substituted
1,2,3-triazolium group with a limited set of counteranions, were recently
communicated by our laboratory.27 Electrochemical
impedance spectroscopy, utilizing a four-electrode cell, showed that
the resulting TPIL networks exhibited good conductivities between
10–6 and 10–8 S/cm (25 °C,
30% relative humidity (RH)), indicating the promising nature of this
class of PILs. Most notable was the appearance of a common “crossover”
temperature (∼85 °C) in the ionic conductivity curves,
given the same monomer ratio. At temperatures below the crossover
point, Tg/chain dynamics were found to
correlate well to ionic conductivity. Above the crossover temperature,
however, ionic conductivities correlated better to anion size, alluding
to the importance of “free” ion mobility. Though these
correlations are noteworthy, a much more in-depth investigation utilizing
a wider range of counteranions (in terms of size and lipophilicity)
in combination with dielectric relaxation spectroscopy (DRS) is necessary
to further decipher the complex relationships that exist between chain
dynamics, free-ion concentration, and conducting ion mobility.

Toward this end, the synthesis of a more focused series of symmetrically
substituted TPILs is reported herein where DRS has been employed to
determine ionic conductivities (at 30% RH) and to explore chain dynamics
and ion-transport properties. A comparative analysis of these properties
across various anions, crosslink density (acrylate/acetoacetate ratio),
and cations (imidazolium 1,2,4-triazolium, 1,2,3-triazolium) is discussed.
Due to the presumed hydrophilic nature of the TPIL [Br] network, coupled
with a minimum achievable RH of 30%, the effect of relative humidity
on conductivity and water uptake was also explored.

Results and Discussion
Synthesis of the 1,2,3-triazolium acetoacetate monomers began by
first converting commercially available ethyl-6-bromohexanoate to
the azide with sodium azide (Scheme 1). Reaction with trimethylsilylacetylene under Cu-catalyzed
click cyclization conditions resulted in the tetramethylsilane-substituted
triazole ring (not isolated), which was subsequently treated with
a fluoride source (tetrabutylammonium fluoride, TBAF) to provide the
desired 1,2,3-triazole ester 1.21 Reduction of the ester was then accomplished with diisobutylaluminum
hydride (DIBAL-H), resulting in 1-(6′-hydroxyhexyl)-1,2,3-triazole 2. Transesterification with tert-butylacetoacetate,
followed by coupling with 6-bromohexylacetoacetate 4,
resulted in the targeted acetoacetate [Br] monomer 5.
Various anion metathesis reactions (AgNO3, AgBF4, AgOTf, LiNTf2) were then employed to gain access to
other counteranions of interest (monomers 6–9). All of the 1,2,3-triazolium acetoacetate monomers were
clear, room-temperature ionic liquids with varying degrees of yellow
to orange color. 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopies,
as well as elemental analysis, were used to identify the products
and determine purity, respectively, and residual [Br] for PILs 6–9 was found to be <0.1% w/w by ion
chromatography.28

Scheme 1 Preparation of 1,2,3-Triazolium
Acetoacetate Monomers 5–9
Analysis of the thermal properties
of acetoacetate monomers 5–9 was
conducted prior to polymerization.
Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) Tg values (Table 1, Figure S18) correlated inversely to the size
of the counteranion on the order of [Br] > [NO3] ≈
[BF4] > [OTf] > [NTf2]. Here, assessment
of
the relative anion sizes is based upon molar masses and thermochemical
radii.29 The ability of ionic liquids to
exhibit glass-forming behavior has been previously described using
techniques such as DSC, X-ray diffraction, and Raman spectroscopy.30,31 It is also worth noting that the observed relationship between anion
size and Tg has been observed previously
with imidazolium- and 1,2,4-triazolium-containing acetoacetate monomers.17−19

Thermal stability, as defined by Td5% (the temperature at which 5% of the material
has decomposed), correlates
inversely to the Lewis basicity of the counteranion on the order of
[NTf2] > [OTf] > [BF4] > [NO3] >
[Br] (Table 1 and Figure S19).32 All
of the acetoacetate monomers exhibited a one-step degradation except
for [BF4] 7 where a two-step process was observed.
Recent work by Clarke et al. using direct insertion mass spectrometry
investigated the decomposition products of 1-alkyl-3-methylimidazolium
[BF4] ILs and found fluoride to be a thermally induced
product of the reaction between tetrafluoroborate and the imidazolium
cation.33 We hypothesize here that as IL
monomer 7 is being heated, fluoride is generated. As
fluoride is a stronger Lewis base (compared to tetrafluoroborate),
the first step results from decomposition of the monomer from [F]
(the exact nature of the decomposition was not determined as part
of this study). The second step would represent decomposition as a
result of [BF4]. To support this hypothesis, the production
of fluoride from [BF4] acetoacetate monomer 7 was observed as a function of time using isothermal thermogravimetric
analysis (TGA) (at 200 °C) followed by analysis of the residue
by ion chromatography. Fluoride content of monomer 7 (determined
from the [F]/[BF4] ratio) was found to be negligible, however,
a 20-fold increase in fluoride concentration was observed during the
first hour at 200 °C. Additional time found the amount of [F]
and [BF4] to decrease, presumably because both anions are
being consumed as part of monomer decomposition. The results from
this study clearly show that fluoride is thermally generated during
the decomposition of [BF4] monomer 7 and thus
could influence the observed decomposition temperature.

1,2,3-Triazolium-containing
acetoacetates 5–9 were polymerized
following a standard Michael addition polymerization
protocol developed by our laboratory. The appropriate amount of acetoacetate
was allowed to react with commercially available 1,4-butanediol diacrylate
in the presence of catalytic 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene (DBU)
(2 mol %) in a solution of dichloromethane (50 wt %) (Scheme 2).17−19 Each solution
was placed into a poly(tetrafluoroethylene) (PTFE) mold and cured
under ambient conditions for 48 h, followed by 48 h in a 60 °C.
The films were then dried in a vacuum oven at 60 °C for an additional
48 h to ensure removal of trace solvent residue and moisture. Since
conductive properties of the analogous imidazolium and 1,2,4-triazolium
PIL Michael networks had not been previously measured, comparison
networks were prepared fresh, which utilized previously reported imidazolium
and 1,2,4-triazolium [NTf2] acetoacetate monomers (10 and 11, respectively).17,19 For PILs where a variation in cation or anion was of interest, the
acrylate/acetoacetate ratio was held constant at 1.5:1.0. For PILs
in which the cation or monomer ratio was varied, the anion was held
constant at [NTf2].

1,2,3-Triazolium-Containing Acetoacetate
Monomers
Gel fraction and %
swelling of the PIL networks were determined
from Soxhlet extraction experiments using dichloromethane (Table 2). High gel fraction
values (>92%) were observed for all of the networks studied here.
Higher swelling values were observed with increasing anion size, presumably
due to an increase in free volume within the network as a result of
anion plasticization, although it is possible that the use of a more
hydrophobic anion ([OTf] and [NTf2]) could result in stronger
polymer–solvent interactions. As expected, an increase in the
acrylate concentration (polymers 16–18) decreased the % swelling due to the increase in covalent crosslinking
and a decrease in free volume within the network. Gel fraction and
% swelling values were similar across the series in which the cation
was varied (networks 16, 19, and 20).

PIL networks were initially
analyzed by DSC to evaluate Tg and to
correlate to changes in network structure
(Table 2 and Figures S20–S22). An increase in the size
of the counteranion led to a decrease in Tg on the order of [Br] > [NO3] ≈ [BF4] > [OTf] > [NTf2], likely due to a plasticizing
effect
that is often observed in PILs with larger, more hydrophobic anions.
As expected, upon increasing the acrylate concentration and thus the
crosslink density, the Tg increased, given
the same counteranion [NTf2], with the 1.8:1.0 acrylate/acetoacetate
ratio PIL exhibiting the highest value of −2.9 °C. Changing
the cation led to little difference in Tg between the imidazolium and 1,2,3-triazolium PIL networks, however,
the 1,2,4-triazolium [NTf2] PIL was observed to have a
higher Tg value of −9.2 °C,
presumably due to the higher Lewis acidity of the cationic heterocycle,
thereby creating stronger ionic interactions within the network.34,35

TGA was utilized to investigate changes in thermal stabilities
(Td5%) as a function of structural changes
(Table 2 and Figures S23–S25). Analysis of the TPILs
with variable counteranion indicated once again reflected the correlation
between Lewis basicity and relative thermal stability in ILs and PILs.
Overall, [Br] PIL 12 was observed to have the lowest Td5% value (195 °C) than any of the other
counteranion systems due to its relatively high Lewis basicity. In
fact, Td5% values were found to be inversely
related to Lewis basicity on the order of [NTf2] > [OTf]
> [BF4] > [NO3] > [Br]. This trend
is analogous
to the previously discussed acetoacetate monomers, however, it is
worth noting that the PIL networks exhibit higher thermal stabilities
overall. Neither a change in crosslink density (acrylate/acetoacetate
ratio) nor in cation structure appeared to adversely affect thermal
stability, with all of the [NTf2] PIL networks exhibiting Td5% values in excess of 310 °C.

The
mechanical properties of the 1,2,3-triazolium-containing polyester
networks were analyzed using dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA). Networks
which employed different anions were compared initially (Figure 1a) and it was observed
that in general all of the TPILs exhibited similar rubbery plateau
moduli E′ above the Tg (Table 3).
Such a finding was further supported by apparent crosslink density
(ρx) values, which were calculated
from rubbery elasticity theory according to the following equation 1  where E′ is the storage
modulus at a temperature above the Tg (Pa), R is the gas constant (8.314 J mol/K), and T is the temperature (K).36 All ρx values were found to be in the range of
(5.30–6.76) × 10–4 mol/cm3 with no discernible correlation with anion size or Lewis basicity
(Table 3). In line
with the DSC Tg data, the DMA Tg values, as determined from the maximum of
the corresponding tan δ curves (Figure S26), showed a correlation with anion size, with PILs employing
the largest anions [NTf2] 16 and [OTf] 15 resulting in the lowest DMA Tg values (−2.40 and 13.8 °C, respectively) and the network
with the smallest anion, [Br] 12, exhibited the highest
DMA Tg (37.5 °C).

Variation
in acrylate/acetoacetate ratio gave a predictable response
in the corresponding mechanical properties, where an increase in acrylate
concentration led to an increase in crosslink density, an increase
in E′ rubbery plateau modulus (Figure 1b), and an increase in DMA Tg (Figure S27). Interestingly,
a reduction in crosslink density led to an increase in the glassy
plateau modulus. Although additional structural characterization is
necessary, it is speculated that lower crosslinking may increase anion
aggregation resulting from improved ion mobility, leading to a higher
glassy plateau modulus. Variation in cation led to minimal change
in crosslink density or E′ rubbery plateau
modulus (Figure 1c);
however, the 1,2,4-triazolium PIL network 20 was found
to have a higher DMA Tg (Figure S28). As with the previously described DSC Tg data, this trend is presumably due to the
higher Lewis acidity/coordinating ability of the 1,2,4-triazolium
cation.

To evaluate the ionic conductivity of the networks,
frequency-dependent
dielectric spectra were collected on each TPIL over a range of temperatures.
Direct current conductivities (σ) were determined by first converting
dielectric loss spectra (ε″) to the real conductivity
(σ′) domain via the equation σ′ = ε″εoω, where εo is vacuum permittivity
and ω is angular frequency in rad/s. The real conductivity spectra
are characterized by a frequency-independent plateau region, and values
of σ were taken to be the plateau value. Exemplar real dielectric
(ε′), ε″, and σ′ spectra for
TPIL 14 at 80 °C are provided (Figure S29).

Once values were extracted from all spectra,
conductivities were
plotted for each TPIL as a function of temperature. These temperature-dependent
conductivities are shown in Figure 2. Much to our surprise, the TPIL networks exhibited
promising conductivities (10–6–10–9 S/cm at 30 °C, 30% RH) overall despite their crosslinked nature
and were comparable to several previously reported TPILs, including
those from our own laboratories (10–5–10–11 S/cm at 30 °C, 0–30% RH).22−27 Our initial hypothesis is that by anchoring the ionic groups into
a crosslinked network, a more uniform ionic material where ionic aggregation
is severely limited has been created, leading to better than expected
conductivities. The concept of uniform ion distribution (termed “percolated
aggregates”) has been proposed from experimental data37 and theorized in simulations38−40 for PILs where
ionic groups are polymerized into the backbone rather than left pendant
where aggregation is more probable. When comparing the behavior of
PILs having different anions (Figure 2a), it is clear that conductivity depends strongly
on polymer dynamics at lower temperatures. More precisely, lower temperature
conductivities vary inversely with PIL Tg. However, with elevating temperature, the conductivity curves for
various anions converge or crossover, highlighting an increasing dependence
on additional factors. A deeper exploration of the relative contribution
of TPIL properties to conductivity is presented later.

Figure 2 Ionic conductivity curves
(log σ vs 1000/T) for TPIL networks
with (a) variable counteranion; (b) variable
acrylate/acetoacetate ratio; (c) variable cation. The dashed curves
represent Vogel–Fulcher–Tamman (VFT) fitting curves.

When the anion is held constant,
but the acrylate/acetoacetate
ratio is varied (Figure 2b), the highest-Tg TPIL again displays
the lowest conductivity, whereas the lowest Tg PIL’s conductivity is greatest. Unlike the trend observed
with various anions, however, this Tg-dependent
pattern is preserved across the entire measured temperature range.
In addition, the relative differences in conductivities for the three
TPILs at any given temperature are reasonably consistent across all
temperatures. It should be noted that the ordering of the PILs having
different acrylate/acetoacetate ratio also matches what would be expected
based on ion content, i.e., the 1.2:1.0 ratio contains the greatest
ionic monomer content and displays the largest conductivity, whereas
the 1.8:1.0 ratio contains the least ionic monomer and concomitantly
the smallest conductivity. Therefore, the overall ion content of these
three PILs may also be contributing to observed behavior.

Similarly, Figure 2c depicts the temperature-dependent
conductivities of PILs where
the anion and ratio are held constant and the nature of the cation
is changed. As with the previous data, the three PIL’s conductivities
follow the inverse relationship to Tg across
the entire temperature range. The conductivity curve for the imidazolium
PIL does rise more steeply with temperature than either of the triazolium
PILs indicating there may be additional factors that govern ion transport.
For instance, the conductivity trend for cations also follows a pattern
associated to Lewis acidity of the cations (increasing conductivity
with decreasing acidity), which can influence strengths of ionic interactions
and thereby numbers of freely mobile anions in the PIL. All conductivity
curves were fitted to the Vogel–Fulcher–Tamman (VFT)
equation 2  where σ∞ is the infinite
conductivity limit, To is Vogel temperature
where ion motion stops, T is experimental temperature,
and D is the strength parameter, which is inversely
related to the fragility of polymer dynamics.14 The results from this fitting are shown in Table 4, and each dashed curve in Figure 2 depicts the VFT fit.

To elucidate the relative
contributions of Tg versus other factors
to PIL conductivity, each graph from Figure 2 was replotted using
an x-axis of Tg/T; these plots are shown in Figure 3. Such scaling of conductivity and other
transport data has been used to de-emphasize differences in polymer
segmental motion, to more clearly identify the extent to which other
factors impact results. The more strongly that chain dynamics impact
conductivity, the more that the individual conductivity plots will
converge into something akin to a master curve. This convergence is
most apparent with the data presented herein with conductivities for
TPILs in which acrylate/acetoacetate ratio is varied, Figure 3b. So, although those TPILs
vary in percentage of ionic subunits within the polymer, their conductivities
appear to depend primarily on polymer dynamics within the range of
temperatures studied. On the other hand, the conductivity profiles
for anion variation and cation variation, Figure 3a,c, do not converge well indicating that
other factors beyond polymer motion are contributing to observed behaviors.

ratio; (c) variable cation. The dashed curves represent VFT fitting
parameters.

Models of electrode polarization
have been developed that can be
applied to dielectric spectra (both ε′ and ε″)
that allow the relative contributions of free-ion concentration (p) and free-ion mobility (μ) toward conductivity to
be determined. Electrode polarization results from an accumulation
of mobile ions at the electrodes and is most clearly manifested via
the rapid rise then plateau of ε′ when moving toward
the lower frequency end of that spectrum. The region of the spectra
where polarization dominates, then, can be described by modified MacDonald’s
theory using a Debye-type relaxation function 3  where εEP* is the complex dielectric function,
ΔεEP is the relaxation strength, τEP is the relaxation time (or time scale for full polarization),
and n is an exponent dependent upon electrode roughness.41−43 The relaxation time, then, can be correlated to μ and p through the following relationship 4  and relaxation
strength is equivalent to the
following 5  where LD, the
Debye length, is defined as 6  L is sample thickness/electrode
spacing, εs is the static dielectric constant, e is elementary charge, and k is Boltzmann’s
constant. Therefore, simultaneous fitting of temperature-dependent
ε′ and ε″ spectra with eq 3 allows for μ and p to be calculated as a function of temperature from fitting parameters.43

All of the obtained dielectric spectra
were well fit by the modified
Macdonald model except in the case of bromide-containing PIL 12. Example fits are shown in Figure S29 and a plot illustrating τEP as a function of temperature
for the variable cation and variable anion PILs is shown in Figure S30; values of n for
fitting ranged from 0.67 to 0.82. Applying multiplicative shift factors
to ε′ spectra for each PIL resulted in well-converged
master curves except in the case of [Br] 12 (Figure S31), and it appears that its polarization
region should be modeled by a modified or additional relaxation functions.
Attempts to include an interfacial polarization function in the fitting
for [Br] 12 proved unsuccessful in fully describing its
behavior.44,45 It should also be noted that fitting dielectric
spectra with Havriliak–Negami functions at frequencies higher
than the onset of electrode polarization were also attempted to explore
polymer segmental relaxations. However, high-frequency features were
subtle/weak (substantially dominated by electrode polarization) to
nonexistent in the studied frequency range. The inability to observe
such relaxations was confirmed via the use of derivative spectra (εder), which is supposed to aid in such evaluation by eliminating
contributions to the spectra from ion conduction.44

Plots of temperature-dependent free-ion concentration
and ion mobilities
obtained from dielectric fitting are shown in Figure 4. The temperature dependence of free-ion
concentration, or number density of conducting ions, is described
by an Arrhenius function 7  where p∞ is the high-temperature limiting concentration
and Ea is the activation energy for conducting
ions, which
can be thought of as a binding energy for an ion pair. Therefore,
the fitted line in Figure 4a was used to determine log p∞ from the y-intercept and Ea and from the slope. These values are shown in Table 5. The determined values of log p∞ are generally within the 21–22
cm–3 range, which is sensible based on a calculated
value for total possible free ions of approximately 21.1 cm–3 obtained from monomer stoichiometries and molar masses. Furthermore,
the activation energies of PILs 13–16 follow a pattern defined by the Lewis basicity of the anion, with
the most weakly basic [NTf2] forming the weakest ion pairs
and thereby having the lowest Ea, whereas
the most strongly basic [NO3] forms the strongest ion pairs
and requires the largest Ea.32 Similarly, variations in monomer cation (PILs 16, 19, and 20) result in Ea values that trend with the cations’
Lewis acidities, again corresponding to strength of ion pairing interactions.

Temperature-dependent ion mobilities, like conductivities,
are
described by a VFT fitting 8  where the parameters are defined similarly
to eq 2. The data and
VFT fit are shown graphically in Figure 4b, whereas obtained fitting parameters are
listed in Table 5.
With PILs that vary by anion, limiting mobilities increase with decreasing
anion size, except with [BF4] behaving as an outlier. Mobilities
of [BF4]-containing PILs that are 2 orders of magnitude
greater than [NTf2] PILs have been reported in the past,
though no other counteranions were included in that study.46 Furthermore, the [BF4] anion has
demonstrated limited stability in ILs, particularly at elevated temperature
and in the presence of water.47 Since high
temperatures were employed in this study, and measurements were not
made under anhydrous conditions, it is possible that [BF4] decomposition/hydrolysis may contribute to the behavior of TPIL 14, however, such analyses were beyond the scope of this work.
With the PILs where anion is constant, but cation is varied, the limiting
mobilities with [123TRI] and [124TRI] cations are very similar, but
[IM] is nearly an order of magnitude greater. It is likely that this
observed difference is due to crosslink density for [IM] being lower
than with the two triazolium PILs (see Table 3). With higher crosslink density, it is expected
that free ions would be required to take more tortuous paths during
conduction, thereby lowering their apparent mobilities.

Figure 5 shows the
ionic conductivity of TPIL [Br] 12 as a function of temperature
at three different relative humidity values (RH 30, 60, and 90%),
whereas Table 6 summarizes
the water uptake (wt %) of TPIL [Br] 12 at each of these
RH conditions after an overnight (16 h) soak (samples tested in triplicate).
The bromide conductivity increases approximately 4 orders of magnitude
when the RH was increased from 30 to 60%. A further increase of another
order of magnitude was observed when the RH was held at 90%. These
increases can be attributed to a water-assisted ion-transport mechanism,
commonly seen in PILs, which contain hydrophilic ions, such as halides.
Such a transport phenomenon has been likened to water–Nafion
systems and has been observed with other bromide-containing PIL co-polymers,
prepared from acrylic-functionalized imidazolium monomers.48 The strong likelihood of water-assisted bromide
transport is further supported by their noticeably large water uptake
(0.64–27.2 wt %) over the humidity range of interest (Table 6). Such a large increase
in ionic conductivity, as expected, was not observed for the highly
hydrophobic TPIL [NTf2] 16. For the more hydrophobic
PIL [NTf2] 16, ion transport would be more
strongly dictated by segmental motion and polymer dynamics. Although
their conductivities at higher % RH were not examined, it must be
noted that both the [NO3] and [BF4] TPIL networks
did exhibit some water absorption at 30% RH (Table S1), though not nearly to the extent that TPIL [Br] 12 did. Regardless, this small amount of water absorbed could result
in a slight enhancement of ionic conductivity that otherwise might
not be observed under anhydrous conditions.

a Data were obtained
after a 16 h
soak at 30 °C at the specified RH.

Ion mobility (μ) and free-ion concentration
(p) were investigated at 30 and 60% RH for the [Br]
and [NTf2] TPIL networks (Figure S32). Similarly
to what was noted above, the modified Macdonald model fit all data
well, except for [Br] at 30% RH. For [Br] at 30% RH, an interfacial
polarization function was added and while the addition still did not
fully describe the PIL’s behavior, it did provide enough information
such that reasonable humidity comparisons could be made. When humidity
was increased, ion mobility was found to increase for both TPIL networks,
presumably due to the plasticizing ability of water. Free-ion concentration
for the [Br] TPIL network was found to increase, but decrease for
the [NTf2] networks given an increase in humidity. This
observation is attributed to the ability of water to solvate bromide,
while causing the much more hydrophobic NTf2 anion to aggregate.
Unfortunately, the data acquired at 90% RH were such that these did
not allow for a proper fitting to determine μ and p parameters.

Conclusions
A series of 1,2,3-triazolium-based
bisacetoacetate monomers were
synthesized using an azide–alkyne click cyclization strategy
and subsequently polymerized using base-catalyzed Michael addition.
The resulting TPIL networks were analyzed for their thermal (DSC,
TGA), mechanical (DMA), and electrochemical (DRS) properties. The
counteranion, crosslink density (acetoacetate/acrylate ratio), and
cation were varied to observe changes in these properties.

DSC
thermal analysis of the TPILs indicated an inverse correlation
between Tg and counteranion size, with
[NTf2] TPIL exhibiting the lowest Tg. An increase in the Tg was observed
when the acrylate concentration was increased due to an increase in
covalent crosslinking. An increase in thermal stability (Td5%) was observed with decreasing Lewis basicity of the
anion on the order [NTf2] > [OTf] > [BF4] >
[NO3] > [Br]. Changes in crosslink density brought about
by varying the acrylate/acetoacetate ratio did not appear to affect
thermal stability. Dynamic mechanical analysis indicated that changes
in counteranion did not influence the rubbery plateau storage modulus
(E′) or the apparent crosslink density (ρx) in any discernable way, whereas DMA Tg (tan δ max) was observed to be
inversely related to counteranion size (supporting DSC Tg results). An increase in acrylate concentration did
result in an increase in E′ and crosslink
density. Despite the network nature of the TPILs, obtained conductivities
of 10–6–10–9 S/cm at 30
°C were comparable to a number of previously reported PILs. Ion
conduction demonstrated a reliance on polymer fluidity, especially
at lower measured temperatures. Analysis of dielectric data highlighted
a further dependence of conductivity on both Lewis acidity/basicity
of the employed cations/anions and on free anion size via those properties
influence on free-ion concentration and ion mobility, respectively.

Materials
All commercial reagents and solvents were
purchased from either Acros Organics or Sigma-Aldrich and used as
received. Tetrahydrofuran (THF) (99.9%) and N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) (99.9%) were purchased as anhydrous
from Acros Organics and used as received. Ultrapure water having a
resistivity of 18 MΩ cm was produced using an ELGA Purelab Ultra
filtration device. A JEOL-ECS 400 MHz spectrometer was utilized to
obtain 1H and 13C NMR spectra, and chemical
shift values reported are referenced to residual solvent signals (CDCl3: 1H, 7.24 ppm; 13C, 77.16 ppm; DMSO-d6: 1H, 2.50 ppm; 13C,
39.52 ppm). Elemental analyses were completed by Atlantic Microlab,
Inc. The syntheses of 1-acetoacetoxy-6-bromohexane 4,19 1,4-bis(6′-acetoacetoxyhexyl)-1,2,4-triazolium
bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide 10,19 and 1,4-bis(6′-acetoacetoxyhexyl)-imidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide 11(17) have been previously reported.

Synthesis of Ethyl Ester 1
Ethyl-6-bromohexanoate
(10.0 g, 44.8 mmol), sodium azide (5.83 g, 89.6 mmol), and anhydrous
DMF (100 mL) were charged to a 250 mL round-bottom flask equipped
with a magnetic stir bar. The resulting mixture was stirred for 24
h at 60 °C. The reaction was then cooled to room temperature,
and trimethylsilylacetylene (5.72 g, 58.3 mmol) and copper(I) iodide
(1.11 g) were sequentially added. The reaction was stirred at room
temperature for 2 h, then warmed to 50 °C, and held for 24 h.
The mixture was then cooled to room temperature and poured onto ethyl
ether (300 mL). The organic phase was separated and washed with 150
mL portions of a 3:1 mixture of saturated NH4Cl/NH4OH until the aqueous wash layer was colorless (i.e., no blue
color). The organic phase was then further washed with brine, dried
over a mixture of Na2SO4/MgSO4, filtered,
and the solvent removed under reduced pressure to afford an orange
oil, which was immediately dissolved in anhydrous THF (50 mL). A 1.0
M solution of TBAF in THF (53.8 mL, 53.8 mmol of TBAF) was added,
and the resulting solution was stirred at room temperature overnight.
The residuals were removed under reduced pressure, and the crude oil
was dissolved in ethyl acetate and washed sequentially with 5% NaCl
solution twice and brine. The organic phase was separated, dried over
Na2SO4/MgSO4, filtered, and the solvent
removed to give a brown oil, which was purified by column chromatography
on silica gel with a gradient elution of 0–50% ethyl acetate
in hexanes. Purification resulted in 5.77 g of a light yellow oil

in dichloromethane (60 mL). The magnetically stirred solution was
cooled to 0 °C under N2 whereupon DIBAL-H (93.7 mL
of a 1.0 M solution in hexanes, 93.7 mmol) was added dropwise over
a 45 min period, followed by warming to room temperature where stirring
continued for 24 h. The reaction was then slowly quenched with 3.0
M HCl (30 mL), followed by the transfer of the reaction mixture into
a separatory funnel where the organic layer was separated. The aqueous
layer was extracted once with dichloromethane, and the organic layers
were combined, dried over Na2SO4/MgSO4, filtered, and the solvent removed under reduced pressure to afford

Procedure for Michael Addition Polymerizations
All
of the polymerizations were completed in dichloromethane (50 wt %).
In a typical procedure, 1,3-bis(2′-acetoacetoxyethyl)imidazolium
bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide 9 (0.90 g, 1.25 mmol)
and 1,4-butanediol diacrylate (0.37 g, 1.88 mmol, 1.5 M equiv) were
dissolved in dichloromethane (1.27 g). DBU catalyst (9.5 mg, 2 mol
%) was then added, and the resulting solution was mixed for 2 min.
The solution was poured into a PTFE mold and cured for 48 h at ambient
temperature, followed by curing in a 60 °C oven for 48 h. Complete
solvent removal and sufficient dryness prior to analysis were ensured
by placing the sample in a vacuum oven (<0.1 mmHg) for 24 h at
50 °C.

Polymer Analysis
All acetoacetate
monomers and PIL
network films were stored in a vacuum oven at 40 °C for 48 h
prior to any analytical testing. Differential scanning calorimetry
(DSC) was performed using a TA Instrument Q200 Differential Scanning
Calorimeter with a heating rate of 5 °C/min on 4–8 mg
samples. Glass transition temperatures (Tg) were determined from the second heating by the inflection point
of the curve observed. A TA Instrument Q500 Thermogravimetric Analyzer
was used to determine Td5%, the temperature
at which 5% weight loss was observed, at a heating rate of 10 °C/min
under an inert nitrogen atmosphere. The mechanical properties of the
TPIL networks were analyzed using a TA Instruments Q800 Dynamic Mechanical
Analyzer (DMA) in film tension mode (single frequency of 1 Hz) at
a heating rate of 5 °C/min. Soxhlet extraction in refluxing CH2Cl2 (24 h) was completed on all TPIL networks in
duplicate. The swollen sample was weighed (mwet) and then placed in a vacuum oven (60 °C, 24 h) to
obtain the dry weight (mdry). Gel fraction
was determined as follows: gel fraction = (mdry/mo) × 100 where mo is the original mass of the sample. Percent
swelling was calculated as follows: % swelling = (mwet/mo) × 100.16 The influence of water absorption was determined
for each TPIL network (in triplicate) by conditioning the sample in
the humidity chamber (Espec BTL-433 benchtop temperature/humidity
oven at 30, 60, 90% RH) for 16 h, followed by conductivity testing.
Water absorption was determined using the following equation: water
absorbed = ((mwet – mdry)/mdry) × 100.

Dielectric
Relaxation Spectroscopy
DRS was performed
with a Metrohm FRA32M frequency response analyzer coupled to an ECI10M
impedance interface and a custom-built (in-house) two-electrode cell
(Figure S17). The cell was placed inside
the aforementioned Espec BTU-433 controlled-temperature/humidity chamber
to maintain constant conditions (between 30 and 150 °C and 30%
RH) during each measurement. Sample membranes of ∼12 mm diameter
and 1 mm thickness were sandwiched between 304L stainless steel electrodes
separated by a 1 mm thick PTFE spacer. Electrodes were polished to
a mirror finish with 8000-, 14 000-, and 60 000-mesh
diamond paste (Sandvik Hyperion; Worthington, OH) prior to use. For
each sample, dielectric/impedance spectra were collected at various
temperatures using a frequency range of 1–107 Hz
and alternating current amplitude of ±0.01 V. The stray admittance
and residual impedance of the test cell were evaluated by open cell
(no sample) and shorted cell measurements, respectively, using the
same experimental conditions outlined above; shorted measurements
were performed using a 12 mm dia by 1 mm thick disk of 99.99% pure
Cu as the sample. Compensations for stray admittance and residual
impedance were applied to all data via Excel, as outlined elsewhere.49 Additionally, all measured values of real dielectric
(ε′) were corrected for contribution from the spacer
according to the method described by Johari.50
