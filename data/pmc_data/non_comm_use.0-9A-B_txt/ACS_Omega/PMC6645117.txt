Strong evidence of concentration-induced
and dissolved electrolyte-induced
chromophore aggregation has been universally observed in numerous
water soluble bis-cyclometalated Ir(III) photosensitizers bearing
the sulfonated diimine ligands bathophenanthroline disulfonate and
bathocuproine disulfonate. This new class of aqueous-based soft materials
was highly photoluminescent in their aggregated state where detailed
spectroscopic investigations of this phenomenon revealed significant
blue shifts of their respective photoluminescence emission spectra
with concomitant increases in excited-state lifetimes and quantum
yields initiating even at micromolar chromophore concentrations in
water or upon the addition of a strong electrolyte. A combination
of nanoscale particle characterization techniques, static and dynamic
photoluminescence spectroscopic studies, along with atomistic molecular
dynamics (MD) simulations of these soft materials suggests the formation
of small, heterogeneous nanoaggregate structures, wherein the sulfonated
diimine ancillary ligand serves as a pro-aggregating subunit in all
instances. Importantly, the experimental and MD findings suggest the
likelihood of discovering similar aqueous aggregation phenomena occurring
in all transition-metal complexes bearing these water-solubilizing
diimine ligands.

Introduction
Cyclometalated Ir(III)
complexes have realized a surge of recent
interest because of their impressive photophysical properties, including
substantial photoluminescence emission tunability and excellent photostability.1,2 Various ligand coordination geometries make possible an array of
Ir(III) chromophores featuring tailored properties, ideal for applications
including lighting,3−5 biological probes,6,7 and photocatalysis.8,9

In order to make these complexes compatible with aqueous-based
applications, appropriate solubilizing strategies are often necessary.6,10,11 Bathophenanthroline disulfonate
(BPS) disodium salt and bathocuproine disulfonate (BCS) disodium salt,
first reported in the 1950s as water-soluble reagents for the spectrophotometric
determination of iron12 and copper,13 respectively, are commercially available molecules
commonly used as diimine ligands in transition-metal complexes to
promote aqueous solubility. Examples in the literature include those
of ruthenium,14,15 platinum,16,17 and iridium.11,18 Here, we have synthesized bis-cyclometalated
Ir(III) complexes 1–5 as shown in Figure 1, incorporating the BPS and
BCS ancillary ligands.

Figure 1 Molecular structures of chromophores 1–7.

While these molecules are readily
soluble in water, they also display
unanticipated evidence of self-assembly. Dissolution of 1–5 in water immediately produces soapy solutions, illustrated in Figure S1, that are capable of forming photoluminescent
bubbles upon nitrogen sparging. Additionally, these aqueous solutions
display concentration-dependent photophysical properties, including
significant enhancements in excited-state lifetime and quantum yield,
suggesting a self-assembly phenomenon. Such photophysical enhancements
are similar to those reported in tailor-made Ir(III) aggregates, which
often incorporate synthetically complex ligands in order to induce
self-assembly, such as metallosurfactants19,20 and metallomesogens.21,22

Previously, we have reported
these photophysical changes upon self-assembly
in two of the molecules studied here, 1 and 3.23 Expanding markedly on the scope of
that work, several new Ir(III) chromophores are now included along
with a Rh(III) structural analog, 6, and a sulfonated
Ru(II) complex, 7. A combination of static and dynamic
photophysical studies, particle characterization techniques, as well
as detailed molecular dynamics (MD) simulations reveal heterogeneous
aggregate formation in chromophores 1–6 occurring
in the micromolar concentration range in water. Aqueous solutions
of the BPS ligand also show evidence of similar self-assembly, suggesting
that this ligand acts as a pro-aggregating unit when incorporated
into these transition-metal complexes. The high quantum yields and
long excited-state lifetimes of the Ir(III) chromophores enabled facile
detection of this phenomenon across all concentration ranges investigated.
Furthermore, the Ru(BPS)3 chromophore, 7,
was also investigated, as it is a well-studied and commonly used water-soluble
chromophore incorporating the BPS ligand.14,15,24−26 Photophysical evidence
of self-assembly in 7 was observed at much higher aqueous
concentrations (in the millimolar range), consistent with its more
hydrophilic molecular structure. Despite the popularity of this Ru(II)
chromophore, it is likely that this self-assembly phenomenon has not
previously been reported because these photophysical investigations
were performed under optically dilute conditions, thereby concealing
the effect. Thus, this ligand-induced self-assembly phenomenon likely
occurs in a variety of transition-metal complexes that incorporate
these sulfonated diimine ligands to promote aqueous solubility. The
current work details the relevant parameters useful for identifying
and characterizing these interesting classes of water-soluble transition-metal
complexes.

Results and Discussion
Emission Enhancement in Self-Assembled Ir(III)
Chromophores
Self-assembly in 1–5 is
marked by blue shifts
in their photoluminescence emission spectral profiles with increasing
chromophore concentration in the micromolar concentration range in
pure water, as can be gleaned from Figures 2 and S2. Molecule 1 features the greatest overall blue shift in energy. In 2, the emission maximum does not shift; however, the photoluminescence
spectrum becomes narrower with the increasing concentration, losing
intensity on the red side of its profile. Complexes 3–5 display shifts that are intermediate with respect to that observed
in 1 and 2. In methanol, no shifts in emission
energy were observed in 1–5 with the increasing
chromophore concentration, Figure S3, which
is consistent with purely molecular behavior and no aggregation-induced
phenomena being observed whatsoever. These concentration-induced photoluminescence
emission spectral shifts are therefore indicative of a self-assembly
phenomenon occurring exclusively in water. Similar spectral changes
have been reported by the De Cola group upon aggregate formation in
Ir(III)-based metallosurfactants19 and
have also been reported in mesogenic iridium complexes.21 These shifts occur as the self-assembly process
creates a less polar environment for the chromophores, effectively
shielding them from the polar aqueous medium. Ir(III) complexes can
be very sensitive probes of their environment because of their charge-transfer
excited-state character.21,27 In bis-cyclometalated
diimine Ir(III) complexes incorporating a BPS ancillary ligand, the
highest occupied molecular orbital is delocalized over the metal and
cyclometalating ligand, rendering the emission an admixture of triplet
ligand-to-ligand charge transfer (3LLCT) and triplet metal-to-ligand
charge transfer (3MLCT), termed 3LLCT/3MLCT.11 Depending upon the identity of
the ligands, the triplet ligand-centered (3LC) character
can be mixed into this excited state as well, yielding a more complex
photoluminescence emission profile.28,29 In complexes
with such mixed excited states, it is possible that the change in
polarity caused by self-assembly can destabilize the charge transfer
excited state resulting in greater mixing of the 3LC character
in the emission profile. Typically in bis-cyclometalated diimine complexes,
the diimine ligand is associated with the 3MLCT transition
and the cyclometalated ligands are associated with the 3LC transition;28 however, Truong et al.
have found through DFT calculations that in bis-cyclometalated Ir(III)
complexes incorporating the BPS ligand, the diimine ligand may also
contribute the 3LC character to the emission profile.11 The high energy shoulders on the emission spectrum
of 2 for example indicate some mixing of an 3LC state, which is not as susceptible to medium polarity effects.
Hence, this molecule produces the smallest solvatochromic shift upon
aggregate formation in this series of chromophores. The broad unstructured
photoluminescence spectrum of 1 is consistent with possessing
greater charge-transfer character in its lowest energy excited state.
These solvatochromic effects were confirmed by examining the changes
in photoluminescence emission spectra of 1–5 in
solvents of greater and lesser polarity, Figure S4, which are comparable to those observed in the concentration-dependent
spectra acquired in water.

Figure 2 (a) Concentration-dependent aqueous photoluminescence
emission
spectra and (b) concentration-dependent excited-state decays in air-equilibrated
water.

Concentration dependent excited-state
lifetimes also revealed this
self-assembly phenomenon in aqueous solution. With increasing compound
concentrations, lengthened excited-state decay profiles were observed
in 1–5, Figures 2 and S5. Additionally, complex
photoluminescence intensity decay fittings were required at increased
aqueous concentrations because single exponential functions were inadequate
to model the kinetics. In 1, self-assembly was apparent
in its excited-state decay profile at concentrations exceeding 20
μM in water; below this concentration, the excited-state lifetime
was single exponential and remained constant with the increasing chromophore
concentration, suggesting purely molecular behavior and no aggregation.
From 50 to 100 μM in water, a long lifetime component was observed
because of the self-assembly process, necessitating a bi-exponential
fit to adequately model the intensity decay data. This suggested the
likelihood of having two distinct chromophore environments under these
experimental conditions. Further increasing the concentration led
to excited-state intensity decay kinetics that were best fit using
a stretched exponential function, indicative of a heterogeneous chromophore
environment.30−32 Similar trends in photoluminescence intensity decay
fitting were observed in 3–5, where the specific
fitting regimes occurred at different aqueous concentrations depending
upon the identity of the chromophore. Complex 2 exhibited
the hallmarks of self-assembly at the lowest aqueous concentrations
of the molecules studied here; even in 2 μM solution, the photoluminescence
intensity decay contained a minor long lifetime component, suggesting
that some of the molecules are already being shielded from the solvent
bulk. Selected kinetic fits and the associated residuals for 1 and 2 are presented in Figure S6. In methanol, excited-state decays for 1–5 were exclusively single exponential and do not show any concentration
dependence, Figure S7. These dynamic results
echo those from the static photoluminescence data for the same molecules
measured in methanol (Figure S3), suggesting
that no aggregation occurs whatsoever in this solvent in molecules 1–5.

Because of the complexity of the fitting
required in the concentration
range of interest, we have calculated the average lifetimes when making
direct comparisons between samples. The average excited-state lifetimes,
⟨τ⟩, for a bi-exponential fit and a stretched
exponential fit are given by eqs 1 and 2, respectively. In eq 1, A1 and A2 are the pre-exponential factors
and τ1 and τ2 are the corresponding
lifetimes of the bi-exponential fit. This is also referred to as the
intensity average lifetime and represents the average time that the
chromophore spends in the excited state, with each population weighted
by its contribution to the emission intensity. In eq 2, β is a fitting parameter
indicative of the deviation of the fit from a single exponential function,
where 0 < β ≤ 1, τ is the lifetime of the stretched
exponential fit, and Γ is the gamma function.33 1   2  

Sillen and Engelborghs have shown that for bi-exponential
excited-state
decays, calculations of radiative and nonradiative decay constants
necessitate the use of a different average lifetime. ⟨τa⟩ is the amplitude weighted average lifetime34 and is given in eq 3. 3  

Photoluminescence emission enhancement was
also observed in the
photoluminescence quantum yields measured for 1–5. The overall enhancement was greatest in 1, increasing
in the quantum yield from 3% in a 10 μM sample to 15% in a 1
mM sample. Concentration-dependent quantum yields for 1–5 measured in water are presented in Figure S8. These concentration-dependent quantum yields and their corresponding
amplitude average excited-state lifetimes, calculated as discussed
above, were used to calculate the rates of radiative (kr) and nonradiative (knr)
decay for air-equilibrated solutions. The associated rate constants
reveal sharp decreases in knr for 1–5 upon the increasing concentration, while kr remained relatively constant, Figure S9.

In self-assembled molecular
systems, related enhancements in excited-state
lifetime are often associated with processes that decrease the rate
of nonradiative decay (knr). The De Cola
group has observed such photophysical property enhancements in Ir(III)
and Re(I) metallosurfactants upon self-assembly.19,35 Szerb et al. have also observed extensions of excited-state lifetime
upon liquid-crystal formation in Ir(III) mesogens.21 There are clearly numerous pathways by which aggregate
formation can suppress nonradiative decay in transition-metal chromophores.
Self-assembly can induce the formation of a more rigid aggregated
environment, suppressing relaxation from numerous nonradiative deactivation
pathways such as collisions with solvent molecules. Additionally,
the energy gap law may also be a contributing factor here, as the
energy of emission increases with the extent of self-assembly. Another
significant factor for 1–5 appears to be that
the aggregate protects the excited state from quenching by diffusing
oxygen. A comparison of air-equilibrated and air-free aqueous solutions
of 1–5 shows minimal quenching of the excited
states intensity decays with the introduction of oxygen, Figure S10, despite lifetimes in the hundreds
of nanoseconds time regime. For example, in a 1 mM sample of 1, the intensity average excited-state lifetime in an air-free
sample is 463 ns. Upon the introduction of oxygen to the solution,
the intensity average excited-state lifetime only decreases to 393
ns. By comparison, in methanol where the complex behaves molecularly,
significant quenching was observed upon the introduction of oxygen
to a solution of 1, Figure S11, and the excited-state lifetime decreases from 566 to 100 ns.

Aggregate Characterization
Dynamic light scattering
(DLS) was used to estimate the size of the aggregates formed in 1–5 in water as a function of concentration, Figure S12. While we do see evidence of self-assembly
in the DLS experiments, it is important to consider the assumptions
underlying data analysis in the DLS method. The Stokes–Einstein
equation assumes the free diffusion of neutral spherical particles.
Ionic particles, which diffuse faster because of Coulombic repulsions,
can be markedly underestimated by this method. All Ir(III) complexes
in this study showed evidence of a smaller particle size than anticipated
using DLS experiments, with hydrodynamic radii roughly ranging between
1 and 10 nm. In addition, each molecule also showed evidence of larger
aggregate formation with radii between 40 and 80 nm. However, this
larger peak is not a likely representative of the sample on average,
as the presence of such a large particle in any significant population
would necessarily screen the signal of the smaller particle in DLS.36 Additionally, a smaller aggregate is also consistent
with the lack of Mie scattering observed in UV–vis absorption
experiments on these same samples.

To further confirm the presence
of aggregates, cryo-scanning electron microscopy (cryo-SEM) was used
to obtain images of 1 in frozen water, Figure 3. This will not necessary be
indicative of the self-assembly in a fluid solution and was merely
used to obtain a snapshot of the average aqueous environment where
significant evidence of self-assembly was occurring. The cryo-SEM
data revealed spherical shaped particles with a radius of approximately
12 nm for the sample on average, qualitatively consistent with the
DLS data. A few larger particles were also observed in the image,
which are likely larger clusters of smaller aggregates.

Figure 3 Cryo-SEM image
of 1 mM solution of 1 in frozen aqueous
solution.

Atomistic MD simulations of 3 at varying molecule
abundance (proportional to chromophore concentration) further elucidate
the aggregate size as a function of transition-metal complexes available
for assembly, consistent with the concentration dependence observed
in photophysical studies. The resulting aggregates possess hydrodynamic
radii between 3 and 6 nm, in agreement with DLS and cryo-SEM measurements. Figure 4a reveals the self-assembled
cluster characteristics of three different chromophore abundances
in aqueous solution. As the molecule abundance increased, the aggregation
number (gray bar) and radii of both hydrodynamic (black square) and
gyration (black dashed circle) of the largest cluster also increased.
In order to explain the shape of the resultant aggregates, a shape
factor was calculated as a ratio of radius of gyration to hydrodynamic, Rg/Rh. As the cluster
size increased, the shape factor decreases, indicating that cluster
growth occurred radially approaching a spherical aggregate (red triangle).
Interestingly, the shape factor revealed a propensity for growth to
occur spherically, but snapshots of the clusters revealed some directionality, Figure 4b. This can most
easily be observed in the largest abundance calculated (128 molecules)
where the aggregate appears to have segments of transition-metal complexes
that merge together in multiple places forming junctures. Heatmaps
of all clusters existing in the last 10 ns of the highest abundance
simulation, Figure 4c-left, indicated volatility of the very weakly assembled aggregate
in the presence of water. Between 111 and 114 ns, complexes or groups
of molecules depart one aggregate and adhere to another stable aggregate
or collide without permanently assembling. From the heatmap, a weighted
ensemble average aggregation distribution reflects the relative dispersion
of the resulting system of aggregates, Figure 4c-right. The inset in the upper right of
the histogram is a rendering of the final morphology of the entire
system, excluding water for clarity. All aggregation heatmaps and
aggregation distributions can be found in Figure S13.

Effect of Salt (Dissolved Electrolytes) and Temperature on the
Self-Assembly Process
In addition to the effect of the chromophore
concentration, the self-assembly of 1–5 was also
influenced by the ionic strength of the aqueous solution. The addition
of sodium chloride produced enhancements in quantum yield and excited-state
lifetime that are similar to those observed upon increasing the chromophore
concentration in water. This effect was most pronounced at low chromophore
concentrations; for example, the addition of sodium chloride to a
1 mM solution of 1, which was already aggregated, produces
negligible effects on the excited-state lifetime, Figure S14. Similar results were obtained by the addition
of potassium chloride and potassium nitrate, Figure S15.

This effect is similar to the salt effect well known
in ionic surfactants, where increasing the ionic strength screens
the Coulombic repulsions between the charged headgroups of surfactant
molecules and lowers the critical micelle concentration. The surface
tension of 1 and 3 was measured in the micromolar
concentration range and did not show any changes with concentration,
indicating that these are not surfactant-like molecules, Figure S16. However, as these are ionic complexes,
it is likely that salt produces a similar effect, promoting self-assembly
at lower chromophore concentrations.

This was further explored
in MD simulations yielding a similar
effect of ionic strength on self-assembly. Evident in the largest
cluster snapshots comparing no salt with 0.75 M NaCl (Figure 5a), increasing ionic strength
of the solvent promotes an increase in chromophore aggregation. Clustering
heatmaps and aggregation histograms for all salt concentrations and
abundances can be found in Figure S13.
A cluster size analysis of the impact due to increasing salt concentration
is shown in Figure 5b. Adding 0.25 and 0.5 M salt steadily increases the aggregation
(Naggregation) and general size (Rg and Rh) of the
largest cluster assembled. Upon increasing the salt concentration
to 0.75 M, the aggregation number no longer increased, and its size
actually decreases. This illustrates that the addition of salt also
increases the propensity to form a more spherical assembly (Rg/Rh). Quantifying
the number of sodium ions within the proximity of the charged headgroup
(specifically the oxygen anion) at increasing ionic strength illustrates
the screening effect created by the addition of salt (Figure 5c). The inset in Figure 5c is a radial pair distribution
function (RDF) between oxygens atoms of the headgroup and sodium ions.
The RDF shows a clear orientation preference, and focusing on the
first and second peaks, the ensemble average of sodium ions can be
counted within the closest and second closest proximities. As the
ionic strength of the solution is increased, more headgroups participate
in screening, further supporting the necessity of screening to promote
self-assembly.

to the largest cluster formed without salt and 0.75 M salt solution.

Nonbonded energetic contributions
of the aggregates provided further
means of understanding the impact of salt on the assembly process, Figure 5d-left. Electrostatically,
the energy between complexes within a cluster increases as the aggregate
grows; specifically, the contributions from the headgroup oxygen drive
the assembly process. In essence, Coulombic repulsion between similar
oxygen atoms in immediately neighboring molecules tends to destabilize
aggregation, whereas Coulombic attraction between an Ir(III) center
on one complex and an anionic oxygen on a neighboring molecule promotes
aggregation. Prior to the addition of the NaCl electrolyte, the interactions
are relatively mild between the headgroup oxygen and water. As NaCl
is added to the solution, Na+ ions along with their hydration
shell tend to screen these electrostatic contributions. Because there
are more repulsive centers than attractive ones, the addition of the
electrolyte and the resultant electrostatic screening favors aggregation
by minimizing repulsions. Interestingly, another nonbonded interaction
trend was the lack of change in the number of π–π
stacks per complex as aggregation and NaCl concentration increased, Figure S17. Further, van der Waals interactions
play a relatively small role in the energetic landscape of the assembled
cluster, Figure 5d-right,
highlighting the importance of ionic screening in the self-assembly
process.

Figure 5e provides
distributions of the solvent accessible surface area (SASA) for each
individual complex participating in the largest cluster of the system
without salt (left) and with 0.75 M salt (right). Highlighted colors
on the histogram translate to snapshots of the cluster immediately
to the right of the distributions. The blue shading indicates complexes
with the smallest SASA, or most buried in the cluster, green shading
indicates a medium SASA, and red shading highlights the most exposed
complexes found in the aggregate. Interestingly, the inner most complexes
or lowest SASAs are not found in the general center of the cluster
but instead are located at key junctures where the directional growth
of the aggregate splits or diverges. Additionally, the histogram belonging
to the 0.75 M salt aggregate reveals a more Gaussian distributed assembly,
highlighting the increased stability of the cluster by the presence
of salt.

The self-assembly can also be manipulated through temperature
variation.
Excited-state decay measurements at increasing temperatures produce
a decrease in the average excited-state lifetimes, suggesting that
the aggregation can be broken up by the addition of heat; that is,
self-assembly is exothermic. Temperature-dependent excited-state lifetimes
for three concentrations of 1 and 3 are
shown in Figures 6 and S18, respectively. As the temperature approaches
the boiling point of the water, the average lifetimes of each concentration
converge. At a temperature of 25 °C, a 50 μM solution of 1 has a monoexponential excited-state decay. Upon heating
this sample, a monoexponential lifetime of approximately 60 ns was
observed at temperatures up to 90 °C, suggesting a monomeric,
nonaggregated species. However, if we decrease the temperature of
this sample below room temperature, we see the development of a longer
lifetime component, necessitating a biexponential decay fitting, and
suggesting aggregate formation. Repeating this experiment with a 100
μM sample of 1, which already evidences self-assembly
at room temperature, showed a sharp decrease in the average excited-state
lifetime with increasing temperature, and the monoexponential lifetime
of 60 ns was now observed at temperatures of 70 °C through 90
°C. In a 200 μM sample of 1, a temperature
of 90 °C was required to achieve monoexponential kinetics. Qualitatively
similar behavior was observed in the temperature-dependent excited-state
lifetimes of 3. These data strongly suggest that in these
self-assembled molecular systems, the addition of heat shifts the
equilibrium, forming predominately monomeric, de-aggregated species.

Figure 6 Temperature-dependent
excited-state lifetimes of 1 in air-equilibrated water
at the concentrations specified in the
legend.

This temperature-dependent aggregation
phenomenon was further exemplified
by modeling the chromophores with MD at temperatures starting at 26.85
°C and increasing up to 176.85 °C. As the simulation temperatures
were increased, clustering heatmaps show that the clustering becomes
more unstable and aggregation decreases (Figure 7a). Observing the images inset in each cluster
heatmap, it becomes somewhat apparent that the clusters are extending
conformation as the temperature increases. This is further examined
by similar cluster properties as with salt and abundance (Figure 7b). For the first
increase in temperature to 77 °C, the aggregation of the largest
cluster increases slightly to Naggregation = 38, but the Rg/Rh also increases demonstrating the increased penchant for elongation.
As temperature increases further, aggregation steps down but elongation
increases steadily. This reveals that as heat is added and the systems
become more dynamic, the complexes are unable to stabilize into a
large cluster relative to that it achieves at lower temperatures.

of gyration (black dash circle), hydrodynamic radius (solid black
square), and shape factor (red triangle); (c) most probable aggregation

salt, and temperature.

Investigating the Self-Assembly Properties of the BPS Ligand
Aqueous samples of the BPS ligand also show evidence of self-assembly
through particle characterization techniques. Light scattering was
observed in DLS experiments in aqueous solutions of this ligand, Figure S19. Similar to the Ir(III) complexes,
a small peak around 1 nm and a larger peak around 80 nm were observed
in DLS experiments, however, the larger peak was much more prominent
in this sample. Cryo-SEM images are also fairly consistent with the
DLS data, showing a small, roughly spherical aggregate with an average
radius of 12 nm, similar to that observed in 1. We also
observed several larger aggregates in the images of the ligand, Figure 8, which were not
observed in the cryo-SEM images of 1.

1 mM BPS ligand in the frozen aqueous sample.

Rh(III)- and Ru(II) BPS-Containing Chromophores
To
better understand the self-assembly process and whether this phenomenon
is likely universal, two other transition-metal chromophores incorporating
the BPS ligand were investigated in water for evidence of a similar
self-assembly. The bis-cyclometalated Rh(III) complex, 6, is isostructural to 1. Upon dissolution in water,
similar formation of a soapy solution was observed. This complex is
weakly emissive in air-equilibrated aqueous solution and is completely
nonemissive in air-equilibrated methanol. Although not as well studied
as their Ir(III) counterparts, the excited states of bis-cyclometalated
diimine Rh(III) complexes are commonly reported in the literature
as being predominately 3LC on the cyclometalating ligand,
with some mixing of the 3MLCT state, and typically show
structured emission profiles.37−39 However, few examples of unstructured,
or less structured, emission from bis-cyclometalated Rh(III) complexes
has also been reported.40,41 Ohsawa et al. have
assigned such broad emission from bis-cyclometalated Rh(III) complexes
to 3LC transition on the cyclometalating ligand based on
a small red shift between the 77 K emission and room-temperature solution
spectra; however, it is generally acknowledged that the strongly mixed
emission spectra in these complexes are not simply classified. 6 shows an unstructured emission profile at room temperature
in the aqueous and organic solvents studied here, suggesting mixing
of a 3MLCT excited state, but does not show any solvatochromic
shift upon changing solvent polarity, Figure S20, consistent with an 3LC excited state, while no shift
in aqueous emission energy is observed as concentration is increased
and self-assembly occurs, which is consistent with the absence of
a solvatochromic shift.

Concentration-dependent excited-state
decays of 6 in water showed evidence of aggregate formation
similar to Ir(III) complexes 1–5 in the micromolar
concentration range, with a lengthening of the excited-state decay
profiles as concentration is increased and more complex intensity
decay modeling required at greater aqueous concentrations. Corresponding
enhancements in quantum yield are also observed with the increasing
concentration, Figure S21. DLS data for 6 were comparable to those obtained for 1–5, Figure S22, suggesting a similar aggregate
formation.

Additionally, the well-established Ru(BPS)3 chromophore, 7, was also studied to seek evidence of
its self-assembly
in water. This compound was first reported in 198524 and has since been widely studied as a water-soluble photosensitizer
and O2 sensor.14,15,25,26 This complex was of particular
interest for this study because it contains the BPS ligand suspected
of inducing self-assembly, but is structurally distinct from the bis-cyclometalated
diimine complexes of Ir(III) and Rh(III). In the micromolar concentration
range, a consistent and single-exponential excited-state decay is
observed, and there is no shift of the emission energy with the increasing
concentration, consistent with previous literature reports. However,
upon increasing the concentration to 2.5 and 5 mM, we observed the
development of a long lifetime component, and a concomitant red shift
in the emission energy, Figure S23. Red-shifted
emission spectra have been previously observed in the self-assembly
of other Ru(II) chromophores.42−46 Further, sodium chloride was added to a 100 μM solution of 7 to test the effect of salt on the system and produced enhancements
in excited-state lifetime consistent with aggregate formation, Figure S24. The DLS spectrum for a 2 mM sample
of 7 was similar to that observed in 1–6, further confirming the presence of an aggregate, Figure S25. While this self-assembly has not been previously
reported, it is because photophysical measurements have never been
performed at millimolar concentrations of 7 in water.
The greater hydrophilic nature of this particular Ru(II) complex necessitates
higher chromophore concentrations or ionic strength to induce the
requisite photophysical property enhancing self-assembly. The observation
of self-assembly in this complex further supports the identification
of the BPS ligand as the pro-aggregating unit in the Ir(III) complexes
studied here and suggests that this effect is not limited to the bis-cyclometalated
diimine molecular structure.

Conclusions
A
series of five water-soluble bis-cyclometalated Ir(III) photosensitizers
have been synthesized, incorporating the sulfonated diimine ligands
BPS and BCS. Molecules 1–5 show indisputable evidence
of self-assembly in water in all instances, easily detected in the
micromolar concentration range using standard photophysical techniques.
In these Ir(III) complexes, self-assembly resulted in significant
enhancements to their photophysical properties, with excited-state
lifetimes and quantum yields increasing by up to a factor of 5 over
the concentration range studied. Studies of the free BPS molecule
in water also showed evidence of self-assembly, implicating the ligand
in driving the self-assembly when incorporated into these Ir(III)
complexes to promote aqueous assembly. This was further supported
by the observation of self-assembly in the isostructural Rh(III) complex, 6, as well as in the structurally distinct Ru(II) chromophore 7, which incorporates three BPS ligands and shows evidence
of self-assembly at much higher concentrations, consistent with its
greater hydrophilic nature.

Increasing the ionic strength of
the aqueous solutions in these
complexes also results in swifter formation of self-assembled aggregates
featuring enhanced photophysical properties. Cryo-SEM characterization
experiments and MD simulations of the Ir(III) complexes revealed a
small, heterogeneous aggregate formation induced by the sulfonated
diimine ancillary ligand. MD simulations provided a unique insight
into the self-assembly process, showing the growth of the aggregate
being promoted by both increasing molecular concentration and by the
addition of salt, through increased aggregate stability by ionic screening
of the charged headgroups. Given the ubiquity of these sulfonated
ligands for aqueous solubilization in transition-metal complexes and
the combined results presented in this contribution, self-assembly
must be considered when investigating the photochemical properties
of transition-metal chromophores bearing sulfonated diimine ligands.

Section
Synthesis and Molecular Characterization
All reagents
and solvents were purchased from commercial sources and used as received.
Proton (1H) NMR spectra were recorded on a Varian 400 MHz
spectrometer at room temperature unless otherwise indicated. Elemental
analyses were performed by Atlantic Microlab, Inc. For 1–6, in the solid powder, each sulfonate group retains a sodium ion,
and the complex contains a chloride counterion. This is manifest in
the elemental analyses of these complexes and has also been reported
previously in the literature.47 Mass spectrometry
was performed by the Michigan State University Mass Spectrometry Core.

Cyclometalated chlorobridged Ir(III) and Rh(III) dimers were synthesized
according to literature procedures.48,49 The F-mppy
ligand was synthesized via the Kröhnke method following literature
procedures.50 The BPS and BCS ligands were
purchased from commercial sources as a mixture of isomers with respect
to the position of the sulfonates. Sulfonation can occur in either
the meta or the para position of each phenyl, giving three possible
ligand isomers (m–m, m–p, and p–p). The ratio of these isomers will vary by supplier and
batch, giving different proton NMR signals and integrations. The use
of these isomeric mixtures has been well established in the literature.14,16,51 As it has been determined that
these isomers cannot be distinguished through photophysical or electrochemical
measurements,18,26 commercially available isomeric
ligands were used as received. No difference in the photophysical
behavior of complexes synthesized was observed using different batches
of ligands.

[Ir(ppy)2BPS] (1)
Bis-(μ)-chlorotetrakis(2-phenyl-pyridinato-C2,N)diiridium(III) and bathophenanthrolinedisulfonic
acid disodium salt hydrate (BPS) (2 molar equivalents) were added
to a round-bottom flask, along with 9:1 ethanol/water (30 mL). This
solution was degassed by N2 purging for 20 min. The solution
was then heated to reflux for 12 h under N2. Upon cooling,
the reaction mixture was filtered, and diethyl ether was added to
the filtrate to precipitate the product as an orange/yellow solid.
The precipitate was collected by filtration and washed with diethyl
ether. The product was recrystallized by vapor diffusion of diethyl
ether in methanol. Yield: 83%. 1H NMR (400 MHz, CD3OD, δ): 8.39–8.41 (m, 2H), 8.21 (s, 2H), 8.12–8.14

[Ru(BPS)3] (7)
Synthesized
according to literature procedures.14

Spectroscopy
All samples were measured in 1 cm2 quartz cuvettes in air-equilibrated HPLC-grade water or spectroscopy
grade solvent, unless otherwise indicated. Aqueous air-free samples
of 1–5 were prepared by slow argon sparging for
40 min.

Absorption spectra were recorded on a Shimadzu UV-1800
double beam spectrophotometer or an Agilent 8453 diode array spectrophotometer.
Emission spectra were acquired using Edinburgh Instruments FS920 or
FS980 spectrofluorometer equipped with a 450 W xenon-arc lamp as the
excitation, and samples were excited into the lowest energy absorption
feature. The FS920 has a Peltier cooled, red-sensitive PMT detector
(R2658P, Hammamatsu), and the FS980 has a R928P Hammamatsu PMT. All
emission spectra were corrected for the detector response.

Photoluminescence
quantum yields were calculated using the relative
actinometry method.33 Air-equilibrated
aqueous solutions of Ru(bpy)32+, having a reported
quantum yield of 0.04,52 were used as the
reference. For concentration-dependent quantum yields, because of
the range of concentrations measured, the optical densities at the
appropriate excitation wavelengths are outside of the optically dilute
range for many samples measured. To accurately measure these samples
and account for inner filter effects, the absorbances of the standard
and the sample were matched at the excitation wavelength.33,53 For each quantum yield measurement, this experiment was performed
using at least two different excitation wavelengths, and the resulting
quantum yields were averaged.

Concentration-dependent excited-state
decays for 1–5 and 7 in air-equilibrated
solutions were measured on
an Edinburgh Instruments Mini-Tau spectrometer using a 405 nm picosecond
laser diode as the excitation source. A band-pass filter centered
at 600 nm with a 45 nm width was used to select the emission. The
recorded TCSPC decays were fit using Edinburgh Instruments FAST Software,
and the best fit was determined after inspecting the residuals and
considering the reduced χ2 value of the fit.

The excited-state lifetimes for bubble-degassed samples of 1–5, variable temperature lifetimes of 1 and 3, as well as air-equilibrated samples of 6 were measured using a transient recording setup, where a
pulsed N2 dye laser was used for excitation. The emission
was spectrally filtered using a monochromator and detected with a
Hammamatsu PMT. A Tektronix oscilloscope was used to record the data,
and 128 transients were averaged per measurement. Fitting was performed
using IGOR Pro software; the best fit was judged by inspection of
residuals. For samples 1–5, the excitation wavelength
used was 443 nm. For 6, the excitation wavelength was
365 nm at aqueous concentrations of 100 μM and below, and 383
nm for concentrations exceeding 100 μM.

DLS experiments
were performed using a DynaPro Nanostar instrument
from Wyatt Technology. All measurements were recorded at 25 °C
using 663 nm incident laser light. Light scatter was collected at
a 90° scattering angle. Prior to measurement, aqueous solutions
were filtered using a 0.4 μM pore size filter. Each experiment
contained an average of 50 measurements, each using a 5 s acquisition
time. The hydrodynamic radii were calculated by Wyatt’s Dynamics
7 software using the Stokes–Einstein equation.

MD Simulation
The MD simulations were conducted with
complex 3 using Amber software54 with interactions from the general Amber force field (GAFF).55 GAFF is parameterized for small organic molecules
and was previously tested for metalated organic ligands.56,57 The electrostatic potential for the iridium interactions was calculated
using the AM1-BCC charge model that emulates the Hartree–Fock
theory with the 6-31G* basis set (HF/6-31G*).

Each simulated
system was minimized for 500 steps by steepest descent in solution.
Followed by minimization, each simulation was run for a production
of 120 ns with a timestep of 1 fs in NPT using the
Langevin thermostat. A total of 16 simulations were conducted. Computational
modeling at the very dilute concentrations is unfeasible because of
limits on system sizes; therefore, systems of increasing number of
complexes were simulated to emulate the effect of the increasing concentration.
Three different abundances of complexes were simulated, each with
increasing the number of complexes while reducing the number of water
molecules: 64 complexes with 91 051 water molecules; 96 complexes
with 89 031 water molecules; and 128 complexes with 87 395
water molecules. Each abundance was also simulated with three additional
salt concentrations of 0.25, 0.5, and 0.75 M. All systems described
thus far were conducted at 26.85 °C. Additionally, the 128 abundant
system without salt was simulated at three increased temperatures
of 76.85, 126.85, and 176.85 °C.

Size and energetic analysis
of the simulated trajectories was conducted
using AmberTools,54 Discovery Studio,58 and in-house scripts. Key properties were measured
on the largest cluster that resulted from each individual simulation.
Because of the dynamic nature of clustering, an aggregate was defined
to be any complex where iridium atoms are within 1.5 nm of each other,
while the largest cluster was declared to be the largest aggregate
that remained stable for a minimum of 1 ns over the last 10 ns of
the simulation. The distance of 1.5 nm was chosen based on the first
peak of the radial pair distribution function (RDF) of the iridium
atoms, Figure S26. Specific properties
of the largest cluster were calculated including the radius of gyration
(Rg) and hydrodynamic radius (Rh), with the following eqs 4 and 5, respectively 4   5  

Because the Rh is size based on the
assumption of a hard sphere, while Rg is
measured from the center of mass of a cluster, in order to compare
the changes in cluster shape, a dimensionless shape factor was calculated
as a ratio of Rg/Rh. Smaller Rg/Rh reflects a more spherical cluster, while an increased
value indicates a more elongated conformation. In order to evaluate
complexes located on the interior of the aggregate versus the exterior,
the SASA was calculated for each individual in the largest cluster.

Lastly, from the clustering analysis, heatmaps were generated where
color reflects the fraction of clusters participating in a specific
aggregation number at a calculate time for the last 10 ns. From the
heatmaps, a weighted ensemble average for the last 10 ns was used
to create a histogram showing the distributions of clusters in the
entire system. All snapshots were gathered using VMD.59
