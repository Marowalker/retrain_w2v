Enzyme-embedded polymer
degradation was reported to be an attractive
alternative approach to the conventional surface pouring method for
efficient degradation of polymers using fungal-derived enzyme Candida antarctica lipase B. Despite the enormous
potential, this approach is still in its infancy. In the present study,
a probiotic lipase obtained from Lactobacillus plantarum has been employed for the first time to study the enzyme-embedded
polymer degradation approach using poly(ε-caprolactone) (PCL)
as the semicrystalline polymer candidate. PCL films embedded with
2 to 8 wt % lipase are studied under static conditions for their enzymatic
degradation up to 8 days of incubation. Thermogravimetric analyses
(TGA) have shown a clear trend in decreasing thermal stability of
the polymer with increasing lipase content and number of incubation
days. Differential thermal analyses have revealed that the percentage
crystallinity of the leftover PCL films increases with progress in
enzymatic degradation because of the efficient action of lipase over
the amorphous regions of the films. Thus, the higher lipase loading
in the PCL matrix and more number of incubation days have resulted
in higher percentage crystallinity in the leftover PCL films, which
has further been corroborated by X-ray diffraction analyses. In a
similar line, higher percentage mass loss of the PCL films has been
observed with increased enzyme loading and number of incubation days.
Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) has been employed
to follow the surface and cross-sectional morphologies of the polymer
films, which has revealed micron-scale pores on the surface as well
as a bulk polymer matrix with progress in enzymatic polymer degradation.
Additionally, FE-SEM studies have revealed the efficient enzyme-catalyzed
hydrolysis of the polymer matrix in a three-dimensional fashion, which
is unique to this approach. In addition to the first-time utility
of a probiotic lipase for the embedded polymer degradation approach,
the present work provides insight into the PCL degradation under static
and ambient temperature conditions with no replenishment of enzymes.

Introduction
Polymer biodegradation is of paramount
interest for several applications
including drug delivery, tissue engineering, and biomedical sutures.1−3 Conventionally, polymer degradation was carried out either through
chemical or thermal treatment.4,5 Chemical treatments
often involve harsh conditions such as strong acids, bases, or peroxides,
which are not eco-friendly. Thermal degradation of polymers generally
releases greenhouse gases and at times highly toxic gases such as
dioxin.6,7 On the other hand, biodegradation by microbial
enzymes has emerged as an attractive alternate route for polymer degradation
because of the mild conditions, and biocompatibility.8−13 Due to its room temperature operation, enzymatic polymer degradation
is also considered to be energy efficient.14

Enzymes from various sources such as fungi and bacteria have
been
shown to have great potential for polymer degradation. Several enzymes
like amylases, proteases, and lipases are employed for polymer degradation
because of their hydrolytic action on the functional groups such as
glycosidic, amide, and ester, respectively.15−21 Bacterial lipases are generally considered to be one of the important
classes of enzymes that can easily be genetically modified and produced
at a mass level. Also, they are promising over fungal lipases owing
to their alkaline nature, thermal stability, and tolerance to organic
solvents.22 Among the various bacterial
strains, lactic acid bacteria such as Lactobacillus sp. are established as probiotics, avirulent, and part of human
mucosal surfaces.23

Because many
of the preferred biodegradable polymers possess an
ester functionality, lipases are majorly used for such hydrolytic
degradation.24 Some of the preferred ester-based
bioresorbable polymers include poly(ε-caprolactone) (PCL), poly(glycolic
acid), poly(l-lactic acid) and poly(lactide-co-glycolide).25 Among these polymers, PCL
has been identified as a promising candidate for various biomedical
and environmental applications. In particular, PCL has been demonstrated
for its enzymatic biodegradation toward controlled drug delivery and
tissue engineering applications.26 It is
a soft semicrystalline polyester having a melting point at ∼60
°C. It has advantages such as easy processability at low temperatures
(∼80 °C) and safe elimination of water-soluble byproducts
after hydrolysis.27 Therefore, in this
study, lipase from Lactobacillus plantarum has been chosen to degrade PCL because of the enzyme’s probiotic
nature and high efficacy toward ester hydrolysis.

Most enzymatic
polymer degradation studies utilized the application
of lipase over the surface of polyesters to result in surface degradation.28 In this approach, enzymes have to penetrate
from the surface into the bulk of the polymer matrix to degrade it
efficiently. This approach warrants frequent changing of enzyme-containing
buffer solution yet provides only a low degradation rate.29 On the other hand, new embedded enzymatic polymer
degradation was reported by Ganesh and Gross that utilized a fungal
derived enzyme Candida antarctica lipase
B (CALB). They have demonstrated that embedding of the enzyme into
the polymer matrix helped in initiating the hydrolysis simultaneously
in the surface as well as in the bulk and thus resulting in rapid
degradation.29 In their further work, the
polymer degradation using CALB-embedded PCL films was optimized under
shaking and flow conditions.30 Despite
the high potential of this approach, it is still in its infancy, and
no further studies were followed. In the current work, we have studied
the embedded enzymatic degradation of PCL using lipase obtained from
the probiotic source L. plantarum.
In addition, we have chosen static conditions without changing the
enzyme-containing buffer solution to get insights into the efficacy
of the probiotic lipase on polymer degradation in the absence of any
additional physical variables. The change in thermal mass loss behavior,
percentage crystallinity, and morphology have been studied as a function
of enzymatic polymer degradation.

Experimental Section
Materials
and Methods
L. plantarum (MTCC
4461) was purchased from IMTECH, Chandigarh, India. PCL pellets
(average molecular weight of 45,000 Da), chloroform, and Tween 20
were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used as received. Lipase was
extracted from L. plantarum and purified
using the previously reported literature.31 The change in the percentage crystallinity and thermal mass loss
behavior of the samples were studied by differential thermal and thermogravimetric
analyses using Shimadzu DTG-60. For this, the enzyme-embedded PCL
films were subjected to heating in a nitrogen atmosphere from 35 to
600 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C/min under a steady nitrogen
flow rate of 20 mL/min. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analyses over selected
PCL films were performed using Rigaku Ultima IV with Cu Kα radiation
(λ = 1.5418 A) at a scan rate of 0.3 °/min. The morphology
and cross-sectional aspects of the enzyme degraded polymers at various
intervals were studied using FEI Apreo field emission scanning electron
microscopy (FE-SEM). Gel permeation chromatography (GPC) for molecular
weight analyses was performed using a Waters GPC instrument equipped
with a 2414 RI detector.

Preparation of Enzyme-Embedded PCL Films
PCL films
loaded with different weight percentages such as 2, 4, 6, and 8 wt
% lipase were prepared by the following procedure. Initially, PCL
pellets were dissolved in chloroform to obtain 1% w/v solution, to
which a calculated amount of lyophilized lipase powder was added.
To this solution, a nonionic surfactant, Tween 20, was added in a
proportion of 1:4 weight ratio to that of lipase to stabilize the
enzyme in the polymer matrix. The obtained solutions were casted onto
culture Petri dishes and dried overnight to get PCL films having a
thickness in the range of ∼100 to 120 μm. The dry films
were cut into smaller pieces (10 × 10 mm) and used for further
studies.

Embedded Enzymatic PCL Degradation
The polymer degradation
was performed by incubating the 10 × 10 mm lipase-embedded PCL
film in a Petri dish containing 10 mL of 0.01 M Tris–HCl buffer
having pH 8.1. The experimental setup was maintained at ambient temperature
throughout the degradation studies. The incubated films were gently
removed from the buffer solution at regular intervals, washed with
distilled water, and then dried in a vacuum desiccator at room temperature
for 24 h. The polymer-incubated buffer solutions were recovered to
study the enzyme release kinetics. The leached out lipase was quantified
using the standard spectrophotometric protocol using p-nitrophenyl palmitate as the substrate. p-Nitrophenyl
palmitate was converted to p-nitrophenol by lipase-mediated
hydrolysis, whose absorbance was measured at 410 nm.31 The weight of the enzyme-embedded PCL films was measured
before and after degradation to obtain the percentage mass loss. All
the experiments were performed in triplicate, and the results are
presented with standard deviation.

Results and Discussion
To understand the polymer degradation through this embedded approach,
the experiments were performed under static conditions as shaking
could assist leaching of partially degraded polymer chains into the
aqueous medium. In addition, no further enzyme has been supplemented
during the entire process so as to realize the degradation effect
solely from the initially loaded enzyme. Thus, we have employed very
mild conditions that could mimic a polymer substrate in a static environment.

First, to study the efficiency of the enzyme-embedded approach
toward polymer degradation, PCL films embedded with lipase of different
percentages (2, 4, 6, and 8) were incubated in Tris–HCl buffer
solution. TGA and DTA studies were performed on these samples to understand
the thermal degradation behavior and crystallinity of the leftover
PCL film after degradation. For this, the remaining PCL films were
removed at regular time intervals of 2, 4, 6, and 8 days from each
incubated plate, rinsed, and dried well. Control experiments were
also performed with PCL films that were not subjected to enzymatic
degradation but embedded with the corresponding amounts of lipase. Figure 1 shows the TGA analyses
of all the samples used in this study. It is expected that the onset
mass loss of the PCL films degraded by the enzymes would be less than
that of the control ones, as the enzyme degraded films would have
been converted into lower-molecular-weight polymers. It can be seen
that the 2% control film yielded ∼10% mass loss (considered
as onset) at 383 °C and 93% mass loss at 480 °C. After the
enzymatic degradation with 2 to 8% of lipase loading, the onset decomposition
temperature was found to be in the range of 195 to 300 °C, and
the complete decomposition was observed by 395 to 460 °C with
a residual mass of <2%. It is also evident from the graph that
the thermal stability of the degraded film was less at any point of
temperature, when compared to the control. Such a decrease in thermal
stability is in line with the expected trend. With 4% lipase embedded
films, the onset of the thermal mass loss in 2 to 6 days of enzyme
degraded films was in the range of 300 to 330 °C, whereas the
8 day-degraded film started to decompose from 257 °C onward.
With these samples, also ∼98% of the thermal decomposition
was found to occur by 460 °C. Further increasing the enzyme loading
as in 6 and 8% resulted in a further decrease of the onset thermal
mass loss of PCL much below 300 °C (∼195 to 250 °C),
whereas 98% of thermal decomposition was observed at ∼400 °C.
The substantial decrement in the thermal stability of the lipase-embedded
PCL films clearly indicated the efficient enzymatic polymer degradation
at 6–8% of enzyme loading.

Figure 1 TGA mass loss analyses of 2, 4, 6, and
8% lipase-embedded PCL films
before (control) and after enzymatic polymer degradation.

The semicrystalline nature of PCL allows one to
probe the change
in crystallinity as a function of polymer degradation. DTA analyses
on all the PCL samples used in this study were performed before and
after enzymatic degradation (Figure 2). The 2 to 8% lipase-embedded PCL films possessed
melting points in the range of 60 to 70 °C. In all the samples,
the melting point was found to be increased by 5 to 10 °C after
the enzymatic degradation due to the increase in crystallinity. Table 1 summarizes the variation
in percentage crystallinity of the enzyme-degraded PCL films as a
function of time and compared against the corresponding controls.
It can be noted that the pristine PCL film without any embedded enzyme
was reported to possess a percentage crystallinity of ∼55 %.31,32 The enthalpy of fusion for the 100% crystalline PCL is known to
be 139.5 J/g, using which the percentage crystallinity of our samples
were calculated from the enthalpy of fusion values obtained from DTA
analyses.33 The percentage crystallinity
of 2 to 8% lipase-embedded PCL films was found to be in the range
of 37 to 39%. Thus, the embedding of enzymes in the PCL matrix caused
a significant degree of amorphization that could be due to the incorporation
of enzymes into the polymer matrix, thereby disrupting the crystalline
regions. After 2 days of enzymatic degradation, the percentage crystallinity
of the residual PCL films was found to be significantly increased
to the range of 51 to 75%. This substantial increase in the percentage
crystallinity indicates the efficient enzymatic degradation of amorphous
regions in the PCL matrix even by 2 days. It is known that the enzymatic
degradation of semicrystalline polymers mainly occur in amorphous
regions.34,35 Further incubation of the PCL films for
a longer duration up to 8 days resulted in a gradual increase in the
percentage crystallinity. By 8 days of degradation, the percentage
crystallinity with varying enzyme-loaded PCL films was found to increase
to the range of ∼70 to 95%. These observations clearly indicate
that the amorphous regions of the PCL films have been degraded more
effectively than the crystalline regions and the 8% lipase-embedded
PCL film subjected to 8 days of enzymatic degradation was found to
be the most efficient.

8% lipase-embedded
PCL films before (control) and after enzymatic polymer degradation.

To further ascertain the enzymatic degradation of
the amorphous
PCL regions, we have performed XRD analyses of the 8% lipase-embedded
polymer film before and after subjecting to 8 days of degradation
(Figure 3). As seen
from the figure, the pristine PCL film exhibited peaks corresponding
to (110) and (200) planes at 21.6 and 23.8° 2θ values,
respectively.36,37 In addition, a small shoulder
at 2θ = 22.2° corresponding to the (111) plane was observed,
proving the characteristic semicrystalline nature of PCL. The crystallite
size of the (110) and (200) peaks calculated using Scherrer’s
formula was 23.2 and 11.7 nm, respectively. The 8% enzyme-loaded PCL
control film, on the other hand, exhibited a gentle decrease in the
crystallinity with a crystallite size of 16.8 and 10.8 nm for the
(110) and (200) peaks, respectively. The decrease in the percentage
crystallinity with enzyme loading corroborated the amorphization of
the PCL matrix with the embedding of lipase, as indicated by DTA analyses.
However, after 8 days of degradation, the percentage crystallinity
was found to be substantially increased. The crystallite sizes corresponding
to the respective (110) and (200) peaks in this case were found to
be 26.5, and 22.8 nm. These results additionally corroborate the mechanism
that the amorphous regions of the polymer films were degraded by the
lipase, thereby increasing the percentage crystallinity of the remaining
PCL films.

Figure 3 XRD patterns of pristine PCL film, 8% lipase-embedded PCL film
(control), and 8% lipase-embedded PCL film after 8 days of incubation.

The enzyme release kinetics of
the lipase-embedded PCL films was
studied to quantify the amount of enzyme leached from the polymer
matrix to the buffer solution (Figure 4a). Simultaneously, the percentage mass loss of the
lipase-embedded PCL films was studied to monitor the polymer degradation
(Figure 4b). For this,
PCL films embedded with 2 to 8% L. plantarum lipase were incubated for different time periods of 2 to 8 days
in the Tris–HCl buffer. The supernatant solution was collected
and analyzed for the amount of enzyme leached. It was observed that
50–65 % of the embedded lipase leached out of the PCL matrix
in 2 days. With further incubation of 4 days, additional 2–5%
of the lipase leaching to the buffer solution was observed. A similar
magnitude of enzyme release from the PCL matrix was observed on days
6 and 8 as well. Thus, a significant portion of the embedded enzyme
was released to the buffer solution over a course of time. It is presumed
that the enzyme leaching from the PCL matrix was assisted by the rapid
polymer degradation within 2 days. The percentage mass loss studies
of enzyme-embedded PCL films revealed a clear trend of increasing
polymer degradation with time as well as with higher loading of lipase.
The lowest mass loss of 11% was observed with 2% lipase-embedded PCL
film in 2 days. During the same period of time, the observed mass
losses with 4, 6, and 8% lipase-embedded PCL films were 27, 32, and
35%, respectively. This shows that a significant portion of the polymer
matrix got degraded within 2 days, which could also have assisted
in the leaching of the embedded lipase. Among all the enzyme loadings,
2 to 6% yielded a steady increase in the percentage degradation. Between
6 and 8% loadings, the latter showed only a marginal increment in
the percentage mass loss. The percentage mass loss after 8 days was
observed to be 71 and 73% with 6 and 8% lipase loadings, respectively.
Correlating with the DTA studies, it is obvious that the enzymes efficiently
hydrolyzed the amorphous regions of the PCL film. These results show
the high efficacy of the L. plantarum lipase in degrading the PCL films, when embedded in the matrix.

Figure 4 (a) Lipase
release kinetics and (b) polymer mass loss analyses
of 2, 4, 6, and 8% lipase-embedded PCL films after 2, 4, 6, and 8
days of incubation.

FE-SEM images on the
lipase-embedded PCL films were obtained with
different quantities (2 to 8 wt %) of lipase-loaded samples against
degradation time to monitor the surface and cross-sectional morphological
changes. Figure 5 presents
the FE-SEM images of lipase-embedded control samples before subjecting
to enzymatic degradation. It can be seen from the images that the
nondegraded samples possessed a relatively smooth surface morphology
as well as cross sections. The cross-sectional views also revealed
the average thickness of the films in the range of ∼100 to
120 μm. After 2 days of polymer degradation, the FE-SEM imaging
on 2 and 4 wt % lipase loaded PCL films revealed a little degradation
on the surface and cross-sectional morphology (Figure 6). However, the 6 and 8 wt % lipase-loaded
PCL films possessed relatively a greater amount of degraded polymer
that was evidenced by the cracks on the surface and cross-sectional
views. After 4 days, the polymer degradation was more evident with
all the lipase loadings (Figure 7). In this case, the surface of the polymer films was
found to have macropores that were in the range of ∼2 to 3
μm. The cross-sectional imaging revealed a greater degree of
polymer degradation in 4 days. Macropores, whose dimensions are several
tens of micrometers, were also observed. Similar surface and cross-sectional
morphologies were also observed in polymer samples that were subjected
to 6 days of degradation (Figure 8). In our earlier work, we employed a pouring strategy
of enzymes on the polymer surface that did not result in formation
of any pores in the bulk of the PCL film.31 It is obvious that such a strategy results in slower polymer degradation,
as the enzymes have to penetrate from the surface in a two-dimensional
fashion. Such surface degradation was employed for enzymatic lithography
to fabricate micron-to-submicron-scale patterns in PCL. Using microcontact
printing and polymer pen lithography techniques, enzymes have been
applied over selective regions on the PCL film surface, which resulted
in enzymatic hydrolysis to create patterns through surface degradation.38,39 On the other hand, in the embedded approach, the enzymes present
in the bulk of the polymer film start to degrade the matrix in a three-dimensional
fashion, resulting in micron-scale pores. This was evidenced by the
enzyme leaching studies, which indicate that the lipase can freely
approach the surface and the bulk of the polymer, thereby leading
to faster degradation. It is known that water is essential for enzymatic
hydrolysis of polyesters. Ganesh and Gross reported that as the humidity
was increased from 20 to 95 %, the enzymatic polymer degradation was
found to be accelerated.30 They have also
reported that at 75 and 95% relative humidity, the percentage water
content in the enzyme-embedded PCL film were found to be 0.30 and
0.82, respectively. Under these conditions, the enzymatic polymer
degradation was found to be highly efficient. Thus, it has been shown
that the water molecules could diffuse through the enzyme-embedded
PCL matrix and assist in hydrolysis. Because we also employed a relative
humidity of 75 % in our study, the mechanism of water diffusion to
the bulk of the polymer film and the subsequent hydrolysis can be
correlated to that reported in the literature. The PCL samples subjected
to 8 days of degradation were found to be highly brittle and therefore
could not be obtained as free-standing films for the FE-SEM observation.
Hence, the obtained crumbled pieces were used for morphological analyses
(Figure 9). In this
case also, the surface of the remaining crystalline powders possessed
micron-scale pores. In all the cases, the 6 and 8 wt % lipase loaded
samples exhibited relatively higher degree of degradation than the
lower enzyme loadings. All these results corroborated the TGA and
DTA analyses. The degradation of the PCL films into crumbled pieces
by 8 days of incubation clearly indicated the high efficacy of the
lipase-embedded degradation approach.

Gel permeation chromatography (GPC) analyses were carried
out with
8% lipase-embedded PCL samples to understand the change in molecular
weight as a function of polymer degradation. Table 2 lists the number-average molecular weight
(Mn), weight-average molecular weight
(Mw), and polydispersity index (PDI) of
the lipase-embedded PCL films before and after subjecting to varying
times of incubation. It can be seen from the table that the control
sample exhibited Mn and Mw values of 36500 and 53030, respectively. With the leftover
PCL films after enzymatic degradation, the Mn and Mw values were found to be
significantly lower than the control, indicating efficient degradation
of the polymer films.

Conclusions
PCL films embedded with 2 to 8 wt % lipase derived from a probiotic
source L. plantarum were studied for
their enzymatic degradation. TGA analyses showed a substantial decrease
(∼100 °C) in the onset thermal decomposition temperature,
when compared between the lipase-embedded PCL film before and after
subjecting to 8 days of incubation. With the increase in lipase content
from 2 to 8%, the thermal decomposition temperature for complete mass
loss was found to decrease from 460 to 395 °C. It was found from
the DTA analyses that the lipase-embedded control PCL films exhibited
percentage crystallinity in the range of 30 to 39%. Among the different
loading of lipase, 8% exhibited the highest enzymatic activity on
the amorphous regions of the PCL films that resulted in increasing
the crystallinity from 39% to 75% by 2 days and to 95% by 8 days.
XRD analyses on the 8% lipase-embedded PCL film confirmed that the
crystallite sizes of the respective (110) and (200) peaks calculated
using Scherrer’s formula were increased by ∼1.5 to 2.1
times after enzymatic polymer degradation. The enzyme release kinetics
revealed leaching of ∼50 to 65% of the embedded lipase into
the buffer solution by 2 days. Such leaching was found to be beneficial
in generating micron-scale pores in the bulk of the polymer film,
which provided greater accessibility to the enzymes to freely approach
the surface as well as the bulk of the PCL film. The gravimetric analyses
revealed that the lowest mass loss of 11% was exhibited by the 2%
lipase-embedded polymer film after 2 days and the highest mass loss
of 73% was observed with 8% lipase loading after 8 days of incubation.
FE-SEM studies revealed a three-dimensional fashion of polymer degradation
through surface and cross-sectional morphological imaging. The micron-scale
pores were clearly visible in the case of 4 and 6 days of incubated
samples, whereas the PCL films incubated for 8 days were found to
be crumbled that indicated efficient polymer degradation through this
enzyme embedded approach. GPC analyses further corroborated the efficient
enzymatic polymer degradation through the substantial decrease in
the number-average molecular weight of the 8% lipase-embedded control
PCL film from 36500 to 17260 after degradation. It is noteworthy that
the present work reports the enzymatic polymer degradation under static
conditions, wherein no further lipase was added apart from the initial
loading. Thus, the polymer degradation rates reported in this work
can substantially be improved by employing shaking conditions and
replenishing with additional enzymes periodically. Furthermore, the
enzyme-embedded polymer degradation approach shows potential to be
extended for polymers containing ester functionalities using lipases
from various microbial sources.
