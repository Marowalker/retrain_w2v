Natural sugars combine energy supply and, except a few
cases, a
pleasant taste. On the other hand, exaggerated consumption may impact
population health. This has busted the research for the synthesis
of increasingly cheaper artificial sweeteners, with low energy content
and intense taste. Here, we suggest that studies of the hydration
properties of three disaccharides, namely, the natural sucrose and
lactose and the artificial sucralose, may explain the difference by
orders of magnitude among their sweetness. This is done by analyzing
via Monte Carlo simulations the neutron diffraction differential cross
sections of aqueous solutions of the three sugars and their isotopes.
Our results show that the strength of the sugar–water hydrogen
bond interaction is one of the factors influencing sweetness, another
being the number of water molecules within the first neighboring shell
of the sugar whether bonded or not.

Introduction
Although humans have evolved on a diet
containing little to no
refined carbohydrates,1 in recent years,
the consumption of refined or artificial sugars has dramatically increased.
Studies have explored the causes of such an increase, with fingers
pointed at addiction-like behavior caused by dopamine and opioid released
on sugar consumption,2 and ever-increasing
concerns about its links to diabetes and other diseases.3

Recent discoveries have greatly advanced
our understanding of the
physiology of sweet taste perception,4 but
the atomic-scale three-dimensional structure of the sweet taste receptor
is currently unknown5 and alternative methodologies,
such as homology models, are required to provide the details of the
binding of sweet compounds.6

Investigating
the hydration properties of sugars is motivated by
the fact that (a) protein–ligand binding is often characterized
in terms of a match between hydrophilic and hydrophobic surface regions
both in the receptor pocket and on the target molecule7−10 and (b) the interaction between a molecule in a biological environment
and its receptor is thought to be often mediated by the presence of
an aqueous medium (see for example ref (11)). In short, we believe that knowing the experimentally
determined hydration structure of common sugars may contribute to
improving homology models for sugar–water interaction. Furthermore,
understanding the sugar–water interaction also has implications
on the ability of sugars to stabilize proteins in solution.12

We have recently investigated the correlation
between the microscopic
structure of monosaccharides in aqueous solutions and their ability
to elicit sweet taste sensation.13−15 Specifically, in Bruni
et al.,15 neutron diffraction has been
employed to determine the structure of the hydration shell of fructose,
glucose, and mannose. Small differences in stereochemistry between
the different monosaccharides determine a significant change in polarity
in a solution that is sufficient to influence the hydration shell
of these molecules. We have observed a relationship between the sugar–water
hydrogen bond length (and therefore strength) and the sugar’s
perceived sweetness. In terms of their effect on the bulk water structure,
the investigated monosaccharides all have a similar effect, at odd
with the effect on the water of trehalose,16,17 with implications for bioprotective properties against environmental
stresses.18

Among the sugars found
in nature, sucrose (saccharose, beet sugar,
or cane sugar) plays a dominant role in food processing and agriculture,
as well as in international economics and politics.19 Sucrose is a disaccharide naturally present in many plants,
in varying quantities, with the general formula C12H22O11, and is easily split by hydrolysis into the
two monosaccharides glucose and fructose.

Lactose is primarily
found in human and animal milk. It consists
of a d-glucose and a d-galactose molecule joined
by a β-1,4-glycoside linkage. Lactose has two isomeric forms,
α- and β-lactose, which differ with respect to the steric
configuration of the hydroxyl group of C-1 moiety of glucose. Lactose
is a factor ∼10 less sweet than sucrose.20

Sucralose is an artificial sweetener of the intensive
type, i.e.,
a small amount can substitute a large amount of sucrose. Sucralose
has been chosen in this investigation as a comparison to the natural
sugars for two main reasons: (a) it is much sweeter than sucrose (400–800
times21), while, at the same time, (b)
not being hygroscopic,21 it is not expected
to bind water very strongly. Based on our previous work in Bruni et
al.,15 the sites forming hydrogen bonds
(HBs) with water can also bind the hydrophilic ends of the receptor,
and, as a consequence, the shorter (i.e., stronger) the HB, the sweeter
the sugar. Sucralose, not being hygroscopic, is not expected to have
a strong affinity for water. According to our previous work, sweetness
correlates with strong sugar–water hydrogen bonds: therefore,
a nonhygroscopic strongly sweet molecule challenges the theory we
expressed in our previous publication.

To tackle this issue,
we have employed a combination of neutron
diffraction with isotopic substitution and a simulation method known
as empirical potential structure refinement (EPSR)22 developed in the disordered materials group at the ISIS
Neutron and Muon Source. In recent years, this combination has been
successfully employed to investigate the ability of small molecules
to form hydrophilic/phobic interactions in solution.23−27

Results
Hydrogen Bonding in Sucrose and Lactose
Looking at Figure 1, showing the Osugar–Hwater (dashed line) and Osugar–Owater (solid line) radial distribution functions,
the first general observation is that sucrose and lactose have very
similar HB patterns. All of the hydroxylic oxygens seem to have some
degree of hydration for both sugars, with first peaks at ∼1.8
Å and in the 2.7–2.8 Å range, for the two functions,
respectively. Similarly (Figures 2A and 3A), the hydroxyl hydrogens
also show a clear sign of hydrogen bonding, with a peak at ∼1.80
Å. Conversely (Figures 2B and 3B), neither the ring oxygens
(Org, Orf, Orl) nor the bridging oxygen (Ob) show significant signs
of hydrogen bonding, as the radial distribution functions of these
sites with water hydrogens (Hw) show peaks at distances larger than
those typical of hydrogen bonding. Moreover, as expected, all methyl
hydrogens (M) do not form hydrogen bonds (Figures 2A and 3A).

(A) for sucrose and (B) for lactose. The water–water radial
distribution functions for the two samples are reported at the top
of the graphic for comparison. The hydrogen–oxygen radial distribution
functions are dotted and the oxygen–oxygen ones are solid.
Vertical dashed lines at 1.80 and 2.75 Å evidence the position
of the first peaks in the Ow–Hw and Ow–Ow correlations,
respectively. Labeling is further described in Figures 8 and 9.

and the black ones to those on the glucose ring. The blue, green,

(C) Number of HB contacts between water and hydrogen or oxygen sites

Consequently, similar to the monosaccharides, these
molecules present
both hydrophilic and hydrophobic interactions with water, which is
one of the conditions required to elicit the sweet taste.7−10

A closer look (Figure 2) at sucrose hydration reveals the following features and
subtle differences:All of the hydroxyl hydrogens, contrarily to the methyl
ones, strongly interact with water, as proved by a HB peak in the
Ow–H radial distribution function at a short distance: ∼1.77
Å (Figure 2A).

Although all of the hydroxyl oxygens form
HB with water,
there are differences in the HB peak position and intensities of these
peaks. In particular, the peak position varies from a minimum of 1.74
Å to a maximum of 1.92 Å (Figure 2B).

The number
of HB contacts is similar for the two rings
of sucrose and fluctuates between 0.7 and 1.2 at the individual sites
(Figure 2C,D).



For lactose, an average over all OH hydrogens for each
ring (Hg
for the glucose ring and Hl for the galactose one) is presented in Figure 3A, along with the
radial distribution function relative to the methyl hydrogens. The
hydroxyl oxygens on the two rings have also been averaged as Og and
Ol, respectively, with only the anomeric oxygen O1 on the glucosyl
ring shown separately (the α and β anomers are distinguished
as O1a and O1b). The bridging and ring oxygens have been labeled Ob,
Org, and Orl, and also, in this case, their interaction with water
is weaker than for the hydroxyl groups, although their hydrophobic
character is less defined, as suggested by the low-intensity first
peak at ∼2Å (see Figure 3B).

Overall, the HB peaks, relative to the hydroxyl
groups, shown in Figure 3A,B are quite similar
to what is observed in the case of sucrose, although with a larger
average HB length. Interestingly, the average HB length of sucrose
is intermediate between those of fructose and glucose, while that
of lactose is longer than that of glucose and shorter than that of
mannose (fructose < sucrose < glucose < lactose ≪
mannose). This observation suggests that, as in the case of monosaccharides,
the strength of the HB is correlated with the sugar sweetness (see Figure 4).

Figure 4 Relation between sweetness
and average HB length for all of the
sugars investigated so far. Individual data are labeled by the initial
of the sugar name: F: fructose, S: sucrose, G: glucose, L: lactose,
M: maltose,T: trehalose, and SG is the sucralose glucose-like ring.

Hydration of Sucralose
Hydrogen bonding between water
and sucralose is shown in Figure 5. As expected, similar to sucrose and lactose, the
ring and bridging oxygens and the methyl hydrogens are not hydrogen-bonded.
Nevertheless, notable differences from those observed for the other
disaccharides, and sucrose, in particular, are found:Only the hydrogens of the glucose ring form hydrogen
bonds, with lengths varying between 1.6 and 1.8 Å, while the
two hydrogens of the fructose ring, H3f and H4f, show a first neighbor
water oxygen at a distance longer than 2 or 3 Å, respectively
(Figure 5A).

All hydroxyl oxygens form HB with lengths
between ∼1.8
and ∼1.9 Å, although for O6g, the HB peak is very weak
(Figure 5B).

The number of contacts made by water molecules
with
hydroxyl oxygens belonging to the glucose ring is quite similar to
that observed in the case of sucrose, with the already mentioned exception
of the O6g site (black dashed line in Figure 5B) (Figure 5C).

On the fructose ring,
while O3f and O4f have almost
the same number of contacts found at the corresponding sites for sucrose,
the contacts at the H3f and H4f sites are strongly reduced or absent
(Figure 5D).

Interestingly, the average HB length to hydrogens or oxygens
on the glucose ring alone is shorter than 1.8 Å, which is shorter
than that found for sucrose and lactose and for the monosaccharide
glucose.15

function of the Ow–Hw pair is reported as a light blue dashed

ones to those on the glucose ring. The blue, green, and magenta lines
in (B) refer to the oxygens on and between the rings. (C) Number of
HB contacts between water and hydrogen or oxygen sites on the glucose

or oxygen sites on the fructose ring of sucralose.

Figure 6 shows the
hydration of the Cl sites in sucralose. All three gClHw(r) radial distribution functions
increase toward a maximum at r ∼ 4 Å,
with a shoulder between 2 and 3 Å, ascribable to the first neighbor
water hydrogens (Figure 6A). The inset (Figure 6B) shows the same functions on a scale reduced according to the ratio
σO/σCl: here, the shoulder is below 2 Å, a distance compatible
with weak HBs. The Cl–OW first neighbor distance is quite well
defined at 3.3 Å (Figure 6C), corresponding to 2.65 Å on the reduced scale (not
shown). On the other hand, the broadness of the Hw–Cl peak
and the almost flat distribution of the Cl–Hw–Ow angles
(Figure 7) are indicative
of the absence of directionality in the Cl–water interaction.
The orientational disorder of water around the Cl sites is likely
responsible for a large number of Cl–water oxygen contacts
(see Figure 6D), making
sucralose the wettest sugar among those investigated here.

functions of water hydrogens and sucralose Cl sites. (B) Same functions
as in (A), as a function of a reduced distance r*

and sucralose Cl sites. The dashed line indicates the position of
the first peak on the same reduced scale as in (B). (D) Number of

Figure 7 Angular distributions for a subset of the sites on sucralose
that
display an interaction with water in the form of a peak at a distance
compatible with a hydrogen bond. A directional hydrogen bond has a
peak at very high angles, such as the case of HBs between water molecules.
Chlorine atoms do not display any significant feature in their angular
distribution.

Sucralose, although being the least hygroscopic
among the investigated
sugars, has the largest number of water molecules in its hydration
shell. Hence, it does form fewer strong hydrogen bonds, and one of
its rings does not form any at all. In fact, most of the molecules
around sucralose are weakly bonded to its chlorine. For this reason,
it can be soluble, and extremely sweet, but not necessarily hygroscopic.

Methods
The neutron diffraction experiments have been
performed on the
SANDALS diffractometer at the ISIS spallation neutron source, located
at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory (U.K.). SANDALS is a total scattering
neutron diffractometer optimized for the study of liquids and amorphous
samples containing light elements. To provide several independent
determinations of the structure factor of the solutions, we have applied
the H/D isotopic substitution method.28 This is based on the fact that the neutron scattering length bα changes sometimes quite significantly
for different isotopes, while the atomic correlation does not vary
within the sensitivity of the instruments; hence, isotopic substitution
quite dramatically changes the shape of the measured function F(Q). In particular, by substituting 1H (bH = −3.740 fm) with 2H (bD = 6.671 fm), it is possible
to highlight H–X correlations, where X is a nonsubstituted
atom (e.g., oxygen).

For all three sugars, four isotopic compositions
have been measured:
(1) fully protiated, (2) fully deuteriated, (3) an equimolar mixture
of (1) and (2), and (4) the so-called “null” mixture,
i.e., 64% of (1) and 36% of (2). In mixture (4), the XH and HH correlations
are canceled out, being the protiated molar fraction equal to cH = bD/(bH + bD). All sugars
have been purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used without further purification
for the preparation of the fully protiated samples. The sugars used
for the preparation of the fully deuteriated samples have been repeatedly
solvated in D2O and freeze-dried, to exchange all of the
hydroxyl hydrogens. Sucrose was measured at a concentration of 1 mole
per 25 water moles (1:25), while both lactose and sucralose were measured
at a lower concentration of 1 mole per 100 water moles (1:100). The
different concentration is an experimental incident, and it is not
expected to influence our comparison, as the structure of the first
hydration shell, which is of interest for this study, is not affected
by concentration when at least a complete first shell of water is
available.17

All solutions have been
exposed to the neutron beam inside standard
flat Ti–Zr samples (1 mm thick). The standard corrections and
normalizations have been applied to the data through the set of programs
gathered under the graphical interface GudrunN. The
theoretical background to the operations performed by the program
is described in its manual.29

Models
of the experimental data have been constructed using the
empirical potential structure refinement (EPSR) program. The method
has been described in detail elsewhere (see Soper22 and references therein) and therefore only a brief summary
will be given here. The algorithm is based on a classical Monte Carlo
simulation of the molecular system under study at a fixed concentration
and density and employs an iterative algorithm that aims at building
an atomistic three-dimensional model consistent with the scattering
data. Details about the simulation (potential model employed, concentration
of sugars and their anomers in the simulation box, and intramolecular
structures) are available as the Supporting Information, along with the comparison between the measured and simulated F(Q) functions. Sucrose and lactose intramolecular
configurations have been derived from the crystalline structure available
in the literature; sucralose is a gas-phase optimization performed
by the authors (full details in the Supporting Information). Both sucrose and sucralose have a folded “clam”
structure, while lactose has a fully stretched link. Figures 8–10 show
the Haworth projection for the three investigated disaccharides, as
well as the atomic labels used throughout the paper.

sucrose alias α-d-glucopyranosyl-(1→2)-β-d-fructofuranoside. The figure also shows the labeling of some
specific atomic sites; all labels (shown and not shown in the figure)
are described as in the following paragraph. All carbon atoms (not
shown) are labeled C and a clockwise (glucose) or anticlockwise (fructose)
sequential number (C1 on glucose and C2 on fructose
are marked as a reference); hydroxyl oxygen atoms are numbered like
the nearest carbon (i.e., O2g is attached to C2 on the
glucose side). The bridge oxygen is Ob, and the ring oxygens are Org
and Orf for glucose and fructose rings, respectively. All other hydroxyl
hydrogens are labeled H, while the carbonyl hydrogens (not shown)
are labeled M.

has an additional label a or b for α (not pictured) and β
(see O1gb in the figure) glucose anomers. The bridge oxygen is Ob,
and the ring oxygens are Org and Orl for glucose and galactose rings,
respectively. All other hydroxyl hydrogens are labeled H, while the
carbonyl hydrogens (not shown) are labeled M.

of some specific atomic sites; all labels (shown and not shown in

is similar to sucrose with the addition of chlorine atoms that are
numbered according to the nearest carbon atoms Cl1 Cl5 and Cl6 as shown explicitly in the figure.

Conclusions
For all natural sugars, we have demonstrated
a correlation between
the sweetness ranking and sugar–water hydrogen bond length,
with the shorter bonds determining the sweeter perceived taste (see Figure 4). On the other hand,
there is a minimum value of the HB length, under which hydrogen and
oxygen cannot move closer to one another. Therefore, how is it possible
to increase the sugar sweetness by one or two orders of magnitude,
as in the case of artificial sweeteners? An additional mechanism is
required, and the present measurement of sucralose solutions seems
to suggest an answer. Sucralose, two orders of magnitude sweeter than sucrose, is obtained by substituting
three of the hydroxylic groups of sucrose by chlorine atoms. One of
the effects of this substitution is that only the glucose-like ring
of sucralose forms hydrogen bonds with water. These are stronger bonds
than the same ring of sucrose and the monosaccharide glucose.15 Additionally, we have found that all three chlorine
sites of sucralose are surrounded by a large number of water molecules,
at a relatively large distance and whose dipoles are not aligned to
the radial field and that therefore cannot be considered hydrogen-bonded.
(It is likely that the overcrowding of water molecules around the
chlorine sites inhibits the formation of hydrogen bonds at the two
hydroxylic sites on the fructose ring.) Thus, sucralose can be considered
the wetter among the investigated sugars, although the number of actual
hydrogen bonds formed with water is reduced by the substitution of
three hydroxyl groups by chlorine atoms.

The findings from the
current study, compared to those from the
previous one on natural monosaccharides, are twofold: (a) on the one
hand, they confirm the fact that the hydrogen bond length (with a
caveat, see below) is correlated to sugar sweetness also for natural
disaccharides and (b) the mechanism for artificial sugars could be
more complicated and involve a number of weakly bonded water molecules,
as well as strongly bonded water molecules (where short and strong
are often used interchangeably when dealing with structural studies).

At this stage, we can only speculate about the microscopic mechanisms,
which makes the wetter sugar be the sweeter sugar and how indeed this
enhanced hydration contributes to how the molecules bind to the taste
receptors in vivo. It could be speculated that the presence of orientationally
disordered water molecules around the fructose ring favors the interaction
with the sweet taste receptor in some way. Two among many things that
could be happening include (a) that receptor–sugar interaction
is facilitated toward the fructose ring, by the fact that weakly bound
orientationally disordered water molecules are more easily removed,
or impose weaker orientational constraints; and (b) that the lack
of hydrogen bonds at the fructose side forces the receptor–sugar
interaction toward the glucose ring, with strong hydrogen bonds. This
implies a reduced number of possible sugar orientations within the
receptor buds, suggesting the role of entropic forces in the binding
mechanism.
